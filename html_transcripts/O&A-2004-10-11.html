<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often transitioning abruptly between them. The show began with an aggressive, vulgar phone call from an energy sector investment pitchman, leading to a highly offensive exchange.  This was followed by a discussion of the show’s move to XM Satellite Radio, its immense popularity, and the resulting radio shortages. One host detailed his personal expense in equipping friends and family with XM radios.  Co-host Jim Norton then shared a negative massage experience, launching into a graphic description of his use of Craigslist for prostitutes and his sexual preferences.  This sparked a further sexually explicit conversation among the hosts.

A listener-submitted audio clip, “Drill Dough,” featuring explicit audio of a man using a power drill with a dildo attachment, was played, resulting in more explicit commentary from the hosts. The show then shifted to a discussion of the Yankees and Red Sox, including a highly offensive segment mocking Minnesota Twins fans. A nonsensical and incoherent call from “Isaac” in California resulted in another offensive exchange with the hosts. The show concluded this section with the playing of another sexually explicit audio clip, “Duck Job,” followed by discussion of Christopher Reeve’s death and speculation about his wife's future, all punctuated by vulgarity and sexual innuendo, and ending with discussion of the upcoming Superman movie.


The next major segment focused on the 2004 US Presidential election, Hollywood, and celebrity culture. The hosts expressed strong, often derogatory and offensive opinions about George W. Bush, John Kerry, their wives, Michael Moore, P. Diddy, Laura Bush, Teresa Heinz Kerry, and Paris Hilton, frequently employing misogynistic and homophobic language.  They presented a fictional, sexually suggestive advertisement for "Klee Motors" and discussed farts extensively.  The conversation transitioned to the cancellation of "Tough Crowd with Colin Quinn," Sean Penn's activism, Susan Sarandon, and a planned "Wiffle Ball Bat Challenge" with a female guest. A caller from Tennessee suggested recording sex acts for legal protection, and the show concluded with speculation about a smallpox epidemic, all using offensive language. Jim Norton remained a co-host throughout this portion.

A subsequent segment opened with Opie's sarcastic comparison of a delayed smallpox warning to a toilet flushing. He lamented his career choice, wishing he'd worked for a defunct company like WorldCom or Enron.  A commercial for Into Tomorrow and XM radio station promotions followed. The hosts engaged in vulgar and sexually explicit banter, referencing a "wiffle ball bat girl" and a difficult coworker, the "Frank Sinatra guy." A caller praised the show and criticized Howard Stern.  Discussion shifted to the Pittsburgh Steelers, Sean Penn's criticism of *Team America: World Police*, and a listener call-in segment debating the "hottest scene in movie history," filled with vulgar descriptions. Further criticisms of Bush and Cheney, crude jokes, sexual innuendo, and discussion of Susan Sarandon and Playboy followed. A bit about a caller needing "caulk" (similar to a Boston vulgarity) and a running joke about an Oompa Loompa and the menacing coworker concluded the segment. The hosts repeatedly referenced their XM audience.


The next segment began with a caller, "Fudzo," firing various caliber guns.  The show then connected with Tom from New Orleans, recalling past Mardi Gras antics involving excessive drinking, drug use, and an incident with Jim Norton's head.  The conversation shifted to an Oompa Loompa puzzle, leading to an explicit explanation of the word "fuck" in various grammatical contexts. Personal memories and anecdotes about sex and puberty followed.  J-Zell recounted the TNA with ONA event in Buffalo, describing it as an unexpected lesbian orgy.  Another caller, Jay, discussed the show's publicity compared to Howard Stern's. In-studio guests Kevin and Jackie were present; Jackie's menstrual cycle delayed the "wiffle ball bat" challenge, leading to discussion of crime scene sex and a brief, explicit display of her breasts.  The segment included a previously unreleased "Hi, Mom, I'm in Jail" prank call and concluded with discussion of a recent suicide and a heated argument with a critical caller from San Jose.

The final segment began with Opie's prank call to his mother, pretending his brother had been arrested for soliciting an AIDS-infected prostitute. Opie then discussed his dislike of health clubs.  The show moved to a discussion of people jumping from buildings in NYC, suicide methods, and a deceased transsexual porn star's suicide.  The hosts discussed preferences for music videos with attractive women, using sexually suggestive themes and explicit language. The show concluded with listener-submitted "I Learned" moments, vulgar jokes, and repeated "We'll be right back" announcements interspersed with XM Satellite Radio commercials. Steve Norris was mentioned as an in-studio guest.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  We'll be right back. 
[00:00:30]  We'll be right back. 
[00:01:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'd like to let you know that we're focused here in Portland, Oregon on the energy sector with natural gas, crude oil, unleaded gas, and heating oil.  We believe in about a week's time we will isolate a situation where a 100-200% return in a two- to three-month time frame is very realistic in these markets here.  Are you serious, bitch?  Yeah, that's right.  What are you just such a loser there that that's the only way you can talk? Is that right?  Yeah, bitch.  Are you just because you don't have any money? Do you just sit there and act like a punk? Is that why you do that? 
[00:01:30]  Yeah, that's it.  I guess you're at home during the day, so you must be sitting there just watching Playboy's channel.  Yeah, how did you know?  I wish you had a girlfriend.  You're trying to sell me some crap over the phone and you're calling me a loser?  You're going to take innocent people's money, some crap.  If it was so good, you would just invest all your money yourself.  Why are you calling people?  What are you doing at home during the day? That's what I got to wonder.  I'm waiting for you to call.  Oh, is that right?  Yeah.  Yeah, but I got a string of little boys walking through your apartment, don't you?  Yeah.  And your son is the first one.  Oh, is that right?  Yeah, that's right. 
[00:02:00]  You're real clever, aren't you?  Yeah.  I guess I'm just wasting my time with a guy who can't get his ass off the couch during the day, I guess, right?  Yeah, that's it.  All right. Let's go back to the porno channel, okay, buddy?  All right, thanks, bitch.  All right. 
[00:02:30]  All right. 
[00:03:00]  All right. 
[00:03:30]  All right.  All right. 
[00:04:00]  Thank you. 
[00:04:30]  Thank you. 
[00:05:00]  Thank you. 
[00:05:30]  Opie and Anthony had encouraged a couple to have sex at locations where producer was waiting to call in the play-by-play.  Opie and Anthony were fired and their nationally syndicated show canceled. 
[00:06:00]  Did these shock jocks simply go too far?  When it crossed the line.  This is outrageous.  Oh, dear.  What are you, stupid?  Huh?  Just when everything was going good.  Greg Opie Hughes.  I like yambags on the tolls.  And Anthony Cullia.  I'm hoping for a big, fiery rear-ender.  Broadcast an outrageous live account of a couple allegedly having sex right in New York's St. Patrick's Cathedral on a holy day of obligation.  Resided over the slaughter of a wild pig.  Closed down San Francisco's Bay Bridge.  Encouraged teenage girls to run naked. 
[00:06:30]  And invited listeners to compare the taste of eggnog and urine.  It's screwing everything up.  Shock jocks.  Not only does it involve obscenity in the most extreme form.  The nerve of these people to actually have it as a setup.  No crap, Sherlock.  Die.  Die.  Die.  They'll be an Anthony show.  Shit, piss, fuck, cunt, cocksucker, motherfucker, and tits. 
[00:07:00]  And welcome to the O.B. and Anthony show. 
[00:07:30]  Jim Norton just jumped.  Just got blasted out of his earphones.  The brand new O.B. and Anthony show on XM Satellite Radio.  We've got to welcome everybody that turned their radios on over the weekend, Anthony.  A lot of people went out shopping, did they?  Got themselves a radio, activated it, listened to our program.  The latest problem is kind of a good problem.  What's that?  All the stores are, not all of them, but a lot of the stores are sold out of all the XM Satellite products. 
[00:08:00]  That's what I'm hearing.  They've got to start producing more.  They've got to get those little kids in Taiwan with the soldering irons.  Come on, solder us up some radios.  Ship them over.  Yeah, get the whips out, man.  The O&A virus is spreading across America.  We need more radios for our fans.  Pull them off the lousy Kmart clothing sewing lines and get the kids with the soldering irons.  Get them out of the Nike factories.  Right.  Have them solder together some radios so people can listen to the O.B. and Anthony show. 
[00:08:30]  I was tooling around Long Island doing some spying at the Best Spies.  Were you spying?  Did you have a trench coat on and a spy hat?  Pretty much.  Were you lurking?  I had that classic spy hat on.  Yeah.  Not too obvious.  A fedora?  A fedora.  And did you have a big magnifying glass?  Yes, I did.  I sure did.  And a round bomb in your hand with a fuse sticking out of the top to lob at your foe?  It was spy versus spy.  Yeah.  I was dressed in black and the other spy was dressed in white. 
[00:09:00]  And you were searching and lurking, weren't you?  I also went to the Circuit Cities and stuff, and there's a couple things going on.  Not a lot of product on the shelves on Long Island where we were absolutely huge in our other radio life.  Right.  And if you were just Joe Consumer walking into one of these places, you have no idea that O.B. and Anthony are on XM Satellite Radio.  We've got to spread the word more, people.  Quite disturbing, actually.  But with that said, the numbers over the weekend, people signing up for this radio show. 
[00:09:30]  Oh, wow.  Huge.  We're not allowed to say the actual numbers for some reason.  Wall Street frowns on that type of thing, I guess.  Stupid Wall Street.  But, yeah, the numbers are just absolutely out of control.  So, thank you.  Thank you for doing your part in spreading the O.N.A. virus across America.  Yes.  So, how is everybody today?  Good.  I ordered three online like every other schmuck.  I ordered three nice roadie twos, one for my own car. 
[00:10:00]  Yeah.  I'm not going to wait for it.  One for my parents and one for my sister.  So, hopefully I'll come.  I had to buy so many units for my family.  Yeah.  Because I don't think I could go to XM and have them foot the bill for my family and friends and people.  Oh, my God.  What?  You've got to take advantage, bro.  Did you do it?  Wait a minute.  This is the perks of the job.  Hold the phone.  I've got ten freebies already.  Are you kidding me?  You know I have a huge family.  Every day I'm calling up, I need more radios. 
[00:10:30]  And they're like, well, we already gave you six freebies.  I guess each employee gets, what, three?  Screw that.  I'm up to ten.  I'm up to ten and I've got another package coming.  Wait, wait.  With the service?  Everything.  You're kidding me.  I'm not kidding.  But with that said, I've spent close to $1,000 hooking up my family.  That's it?  $1,000, you know, getting the home unit and getting this, getting the adapter and getting this and that.  I'm still spending a lot of money even though we work for XM Satellite Radio now. 
[00:11:00]  I think I'm about four grand in the hole right now with everybody that I've signed up and bought units for.  I mean, every one of them I've bought and paid for and signed up and activated for the two-year plan.  I've gotten for all my family, my mother.  I need two units, one for each car for my mother and Sal and my sister and brother and this and that.  And I'm footing the bill for it.  And you're getting freebies.  I'm getting freebies but still spending a lot of money, so it's costing me a bloody fortune. 
[00:11:30]  Wow.  You know I have a huge family.  I know.  I don't have a huge family.  I have one sister and two parents and I still can't get that covered.  But I did get the keychain, so I feel good about that.  I have the XM keychain.  See, there's a perk.  Yeah.  I want to open something, get the little bottle opener.  Right.  That's right on there.  Jeez, I can't believe you, man.  Oh, hell yeah, man.  Has it been a problem, though?  What do you mean?  Have you had to make a lot of calls?  Like, I just didn't want to...  You know, they wore me down with the pre-show meetings because I didn't want to deal with any of these people. 
[00:12:00]  After the meetings that we had and sitting in rooms for hours on end, I didn't want to then be on the phone.  So I just went out and bought the units.  You've got to know Dave's phone number.  Really?  That's the guy?  Dave is the guy.  I don't know Dave.  You just tell Dave what you need, and Dave takes care of the problem.  It's too late now.  Dave, you rule.  Oh, yeah.  I think I'm responsible for half our subscriptions.  I'm paying for them. 
[00:12:30]  So there you go.  What happened?  Wow.  What's going on, Jimmy?  Nothing.  I feel all right.  I actually slept.  You slept for once?  You're dead?  I only got like three and a half hours, but I slept all day yesterday.  So yeah, awful massage last night again.  I'm all right.  Awful.  What was wrong with last night's massage?  Nothing.  Listen, if you like, Hervé Villachez, he was alive and a little taller.  This fatso showed up.  The fat, like she had the pantyhose on, but the gut still came out.  Thanks for nothing, Aborigine body.  Yeah, she was horrendous. 
[00:13:00]  She had a bunt?  Yeah, she did from her neck to her knees.  Did she have a support panel on the front of her pantyhose?  I didn't get that far because she wore an awful lingerie while she massaged me.  It was $140, and I got a hand release.  So I'm trying to offer her more, you know, to go down on me, and she wouldn't do it.  $140 for a handy.  For a massage, which was awful.  It was like, get off the back.  When you're getting a massage, you want the back for about three minutes.  Right.  And then the ass a little bit, the back of the legs, a little finger to brush between  the crack, just to let you know you're both on the same page. 
[00:13:30]  Then you flip over, get your nipples played with, hand release, and she's out of there.  How much do you charge for that, Jim?  Usually $70.  That sounded pretty good.  There's a digital insertion.  I like the way Jimmy thinks.  But, I mean, that's what you want.  Just stop with the back.  It's lame.  Yeah.  All right.  This is what I don't get, though.  Don't you have regulars that you know they're kind of hot and get the job done?  You do, but I kind of like...  Every time we talk to you, it's a new girl, and it's like, you don't know what you're getting  when you open that door every night.  But I kind of like that.  That's the sexy part, is that you feel like you're turning a regular girl into a prostitute. 
[00:14:00]  That's the beauty of Craigslist.  It's kind of nice.  Yeah.  What else is there in life?  You can't take a nice girl and make her a whore for rent money?  Again, spending more money, though.  You really do spend a lot of money.  That's like, you're like the heroin addict that you see on the shows sometimes, and they  ask them, how much do you spend a week?  And they throw out this figure that you can't imagine how they make the money, never mind  spend that much, and you're doing the same thing, only with prostitutes. 
[00:14:30]  Instead of robbing people, I'm doing gigs I don't want to do, just to collect some money.  Look, I'm going to go up and do an hour.  I'll be right back.  I feel like I'm disgusting, writing them checks.  I'm awful.  I'm awful.  You do write them checks.  Oh, yeah.  The ones that will take them, I do.  I have one woman.  I have a big fetish.  I like big clitorises.  I think that's fantastic, and there's one girl with a three-inch clit.  They're called penises.  No, they're not.  I don't want a mule.  I'll show you guys a picture in the break, but I got a picture of the three-inch.  That's not right.  No, it is right. 
[00:15:00]  Wait a minute.  It's everything right about it.  The three-inch clit was from our old radio show.  No, that's Rhonda.  No, I loved her, too.  She was fantastic.  I haven't seen her in years.  She was questionable, man.  No, she wasn't.  She was an all-woman.  She was a lovely girl.  No way, man.  That was a tiny peenie.  No, it wasn't.  I think it was a tiny peenie, man.  No, it wasn't.  Not at all.  Not at all.  This one's even bigger than Rhonda.  All right.  Ugh.  I love that.  I have a fetish for it.  It's fantastic.  I don't know.  I don't like anything out of proportion.  Oh, I do.  I only like it out of proportion.  You seem to like it after it's been punched a few times. 
[00:15:30]  You want everything swollen.  I really do.  Hey, what is that sticking out through your snow pants?  Yeah, I like a tight-wrapped package.  Right.  He likes the package after you throw it against the wall a few times.  Yeah, smack it a few times.  Also, some of the wrapping paper is kind of messed up.  Yeah.  I like a steak.  And the ribbon has fallen to the sides.  I like a tightly wrapped package.  You know when you grab a nice piece of meat, like a steak, and it's tender but yet firm and 
[00:16:00]  keeps its shape?  Jimmy likes it after it's been under the tenderizer hammer.  Just leaking and mashed apart, and it doesn't look like its former self.  Like a crater.  That's what it should look like.  You know how a crater looks where it just goes in and has like, blah, out the sides?  Right, out the sides.  That's what I like.  You'd like a girl on Jupiter where gravity has just pulled everything out, perhaps.  Yeah.  Sometimes you need to leave this world.  That's fine.  That's really disgusting.  It's not, though, but I went and saw her. 
[00:16:30]  Whatever you're into, Jimmy.  Motor a check.  All right.  We got lots to do today.  Let's go to St. Louis really fast.  St. Lou.  I want to ask Jim about this.  Rick, what's going on, buddy?  Hey, I was just wondering if you got your drill dough segment put on your website yet.  Oh, the drill dough.  Jimmy wasn't even here for that.  I listened to it again on the replay over the weekend.  I'm driving in the car, and I was laughing my ass off.  It is really funny.  It's funny and erotic at the same time.  It's funny.  It's hot. 
[00:17:00]  Her voice is hysterical when she calls herself a whore.  There's a whore in your building.  There's a whore.  Did I miss the first female phone call?  Oh, wait.  We'll explain it in a second.  Steve, what's going on with that?  Yes, it's up on the website.  I put it online last night.  Really?  On foundrymusic.com?  Yes, I did.  And could you get to it through opiananthony.com?  Yes, you can.  Brilliant.  Oh, you guys just heard what Steve said?  Because his audio wasn't coming in to me.  Oh, you don't hear it in your headphones?  No, I couldn't hear it.  We have to figure that problem out. 
[00:17:30]  Look, man.  It didn't come out across the phone either.  Huh?  It didn't come out across the phone either.  All right.  That's probably just an audition button we've got to push down.  We're just about up to speed technologically here.  Almost there.  Almost.  Thank you, St. Louis.  Almost there.  Jimmy, you went to Albany, and you missed Friday's show?  No offense, because you killed all week,  but Friday's show was the best show we did because we had this Drill Dough segment.  Really?  That's all anyone is talking about.  I know.  It's really cool.  Why don't we start the show off with the Drill Dough?  We've got to play it for Jimmy. 
[00:18:00]  We have to play it for Jimmy,  and we have to play it for all the new listeners  that turn on their XM satellite radios over the weekend.  A special little treat.  Man, it's so early in the morning, too, for this.  If you're in your car, you're drinking your coffee,  you're not quite awake yet, this will do it.  See, I was listening to the replays and stuff.  Yeah.  Now, that makes sense right now that it's very early in the morning  because it's at 6.15 on the East, right?  Oh, but when they replay it.  Oh, but when I hear this segment again later today,  it's going to be in the middle of the afternoon,  and it's going to be that much better.  See, I shouldn't put in time references. 
[00:18:30]  No, man.  All those rules of radio,  we've got to throw out the fucking window.  Whoa!  God!  Potty mouth!  I've noticed another thing.  We've been saying that we're really curbing the cursing  unless you really need it.  I don't think anyone on this show curses more than Opie.  Really?  Anyone agree?  Anyone else agree?  Anyone?  Really?  I haven't heard him curse much.  I think Opie's used the F word more than anyone else on this show.  I curse strategically.  Is it strategic cursing?  Oh, yeah.  No, I think Ben curses the most so far. 
[00:19:00]  Yeah?  Really?  Yeah.  You know what, though?  You've got to think about the guys.  It's 3 a.m. in L.A.  I've got friends that are just going home,  so they catch the beginning of the show in L.A.,  so this is great for them.  They're drunk on their way home.  That's what I was just thinking.  Actually, right now in L.A.,  every bisexual out there is still whacking their bags.  I should have got the part!  I should have got the part!  You and your plastic-titted girlfriend should die in a car accident.  Sorry, Opie.  This is the beauty of satellite radio, too.  All the other morning radio shows, 
[00:19:30]  they're doing commercials right now.  Yeah.  Instead of doing commercials,  we get to do the drill, though.  We'll go with them now.  And then continue with the show,  because we've got to talk about the Yankees and the Pats  and the Jets and everything else, okay?  Absolutery.  We've got some observations on the Twins fans.  We'll get into it, but we've got to play the drill, though.  Oh, I was so happy.  We've got to play the drill, though,  because on the new Opie and Anthony show,  we don't tease like we used to.  No teasing.  Oh, my God.  The old show, this drill, though, bit,  we would tease it all morning. 
[00:20:00]  We'd finally play it like three hours from now.  Tease, tease, tease.  Don't need to do the teasing thing anymore.  Absolutely not.  All right, Steve, so here's the drill, though, bit,  especially for you, Jim,  because you're in Albany and you missed it on Friday.  Basically, we've got audio of this guy,  Robification, from whackbag.com.  Great Opie and Anthony message board.  A lot of people signing up for that, by the way.  Sure.  And he's drilling his ex-chick with a drill, though.  He's got a Makita drill, a cordless drill,  and he took a dildo and put it on the chuck of the drill, 
[00:20:30]  so that when he hits the trigger,  the thing spins around at high speed.  And his girl seems to enjoy this.  Oh, yeah.  Check this out.  Oh, God.  Yeah, I want the drill.  Oh, please.  Should I cut it out?  Yeah.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  I want the whole thing.  Oh, my God.  Oh, fuck.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, my God. 
[00:21:00]  Oh, God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, fuck.  Oh, God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  I'm going to fill my hands.  I'm going to fill my hands up.  What's the matter?  Oh, my God.  What did I just do to you?  Treating me like a whore.  How did I do that?  By using the drill on me.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Oh, God. 
[00:21:30]  Yeah.  Oh, fuck.  Yeah.  Oh, fuck me with it.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, fuck me.  Oh, my God.  Don't stop treating me like a whore. 
[00:22:00]  Please.  You know what you are?  Oh, my God.  Yes. 
[00:22:30]  Oh, God.  Oh, yeah.  Fuck.  Oh.  No.  Oh, please.  Please what?  Please fuck me.  No.  Please fuck me.  No.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  I think you're done for today.  No, please.  No.  Just a little more.  Just a drill on me a little more.  The drill?  Yeah, just a little more.  You don't want the drill?  No.  I want the drill.  Please. 
[00:23:00]  Yeah?  Yeah.  Only one orgasm?  Oh, yeah.  You promise?  Uh-huh.  I promise.  Oh, God.  Tell me when to turn it on.  Oh, God.  Turn it on, please.  Turn back.  Full.  Oh, fuck.  Oh, God.  You hit me.  Oh, God.  I'm sorry.  You said stop.  Oh, my God.  Oh, fuck you.  Oh, my God. 
[00:23:30]  I'm filthy with.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  I'm sorry.  Oh, God.  I'm sorry.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, yeah.  Okay, just sit up.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  I think the windows are open.  Are they?  Oh, God.  I'm looking around. 
[00:24:00]  Sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm stuck on my tongue.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God. 
[00:24:30]  Wow, there you have it  The drill dough on the Opie and Anthony show  I think it's time to tell your friends to 
[00:25:00]  Get their XM satellite radios  Call me a whore  Call me a whore  Yes, Jim  Can I say that that is the sexiest drilling scene since Body Double?  Nice  That really was hot though  Isn't that great?  How cool is that, huh?  She is motivated, man  That was pretty much our commercial break  Yeah, there you go  Instead of sitting through 18 minutes of commercials  We give you that  That's great  Man  I've seen a video where a girl gets it with a Sawzall 
[00:25:30]  Did you see a big reciprocating saw with a dildo on it?  That one's pretty cool too  It's like a jackhammer  Call me a whore  There's a whore in your building  There's a whore living in your building  We're kind of speechless after that, but that's okay 
[00:26:00]  Alright  Nice  I think this is good, this whitefish  Huh?  Whitefish?  You ordered whitefish from a deli in New York City?  Are you insane?  No, it's out of a package  What is it?  Bruce brought it  Oh, Bruce bought it  That's fine  I'm sure it's okay  I have a package, you think?  Yeah, Bruce is great  I know Bruce is great, but he doesn't make the whitefish  We don't want to be negative every morning  We've got another guy that works in the office area here  Well, he's in charge of this facility here in New York  Bruce, he's great  Yes  Absolutely great  Someone wants to thank us for the drill, though 
[00:26:30]  Oh  That'll get you moving  We really need to regroup  After something like that, you're like  I love it  We're a radio DJ  Paul, what's up, buddy?  Hey, guys, just want to thank you  I'm driving no hands now  Oh, no kidding, man  That's pretty good  Alright, it sounded like a murder  It did sound like a murder  It did sound like a murder  Some points in that  Yeah, it was a little creepy at times  Alright, bro  Screaming  Thank you  How would that be in the middle of the stabbing?  Call me a whore 
[00:27:00]  Call me a whore  Alright, we've got to talk about  You know, I thought I was going to come in here today  Laughing at you guys  I thought the Yankees were going to blow it over the weekend  Looked that way  But once again  But now it sets up the series everybody wants to see  But come from behind Yankees  Once again doing it  Sox versus Yanks, obviously  Everyone wants to see Sox  And Yanks  Together  I was sitting there Saturday night going  Oh, man, this is going to be great  They're going to lose to the freaking Twins  Nope  I'm back 
[00:27:30]  Twins management's trying to buy a championship  And that's what you get when you just throw money at a team  You'll lose  Yeah, coming from the Yankee fan  Shut up  Thanks for seeing the irony in that, dude  Yeah, exactly  Jesus, Ben  Wake up  It was looking grim  Down 5-1  Yeah  And they do what they do  Which has come back  And a lot of people say  Yankees aren't the best team out there this season  You know, you've got to agree  Perhaps the Sox look better 
[00:28:00]  No, the Sox definitely look better  And they've got better pitching  And the Sox are going to beat the Yanks this year  Now the Yankees got the hitting  I'm telling you the Sox will beat the Yankees this year  The Red Sox don't have the hitting?  I'm not saying they don't have the hitting  But I think the Yankees have better hitting this season than the Sox do  They don't have the pitching  But the Yankees have the one thing  The one thing that no other team has  And that, I'm sorry, is just that Yankee magic  It just happens every year  These guys know how to pull it together  When the chips are down 
[00:28:30]  At the end of the game  When it looks all lost  It rallies them  And they come back  They do look smooth out there  When the chips are down  Yeah, it's great  They don't look like they're panicking at all  Or sweating  They're very, very calm  In that situation, you're right  And against Minnesota  I mean, it looked grim  But they pulled it out  I blame the towels  I blame the Minnesota Twins rally towels 
[00:29:00]  No, no  I call them the jerk-off towel  It looks like  I mean, come on  First of all  How many people do you think jack  And clean it up with that towel?  The entire Middle East  A lot of young men  Enjoy watching the baseball  They get the little jack-off towel  You get home  They bring it home  What else are you going to use it for?  And use it to clean up the jeans?  It's in your room somewhere  You get an impromptu spank going  You look around  When you get that feeling  What am I going to use? 
[00:29:30]  Ah!  I got my Homer hanky  I got my Homer hanky  Homer hanky  It is called the Homer hanky?  The Homer hanky  Awful  The jacket towel  Absolutely awful  And they're spinning this stupid thing around  All the fans  All the fans  Spinning it around  Thinking this is going to be  What rallies their team  If you're handing out props  At your stadium  For your team  Just jump off of the high mezzanine level 
[00:30:00]  Well they made a good point during the game  That these people are waving the towels  And the team needed to feel the energy  And that's not how you feel the energy  They're not clapping  Right  You need to make noise in that situation  Make noise  All those little things stink  To rattle the opponents  You know  Right  That's why they need the thunder sticks  Another ridiculous prop  The thunder sticks  The rally monkeys  The Yankees have rally monkeys  It's called the neighborhood they play in  Stop with the little gadgets  They suck  Like a Minnesota faggot 
[00:30:30]  Spinning your load things  Knocking each other out  With your Homer hanky  You know with all the fences  They put up around Yankee Stadium  They made it a very safer place  To go to a Yankee game  Oh my god  You park your car  And they put you into the corral  It's like the XM compound in D.C.  Pretty much  You park your car  There's like  In these parking lots  The fences are 20 to 30 feet high  And then you're in other fences  Making your way to the ballpark  It's a very safe area now  I was so happy watching the game 
[00:31:00]  And when they show the people  In the stands  And they show those Minnesota fans  And they're just heartbroken  They were heartbroken  Because they had been brought up  You know during the game  They thought  Alright  We're tying the series up  We're going back to New York  We got the momentum  We're going to blah blah blah  They're waving around  Their jack off towels  And then by the end of the game  They're sitting there dejected  They have the jack off towels  Over their head  Some people are covering  Their face with it 
[00:31:30]  And all those fat Minnesota women  Just sitting there  With tears in their eyes  That look of disappointment  On their face  Yeah wiping the tears  With their jack off towel  Dumb accent  Ah we just couldn't get it done  This year  But hopefully next year  Ah they looked pretty good  Didn't they  I thought we had this one  I thought we had it  But all of a sudden  The Yankees  The Yankees  Shut up  You're missing a point here  Oh call me a whore  George Steinbrenner  Would hand out all this stuff 
[00:32:00]  At Yankee Stadium  But he knows that  The people would use it  To beat the crap out of each other  Oh yeah  Who are you kidding  Yeah  They're all you know  Yankee fans  But you know  The fact is  When you sit at those games  At the stadium  It gets a little edgy  And people want to  Beat the crap out of each other  No when you go into  Yankee Stadium  They take things away from you  They don't give you stuff  If you're carrying in  A big bag or something like that  They take things away  People in the Midwest  Much nicer than the people  Here on the East Coast  We understand that  At the Yankee games  You hand out those  Thunder sticks and stuff 
[00:32:30]  They're going to beat  The crap out of each other  Oh there'd be people  Being assaulted with them  They'll figure out  How to make it into a weapon  Mmhmm  Fashion it into  I know it's like  A big prison yard  They could fashion anything  Into a shank  And those jerk off towels  They'd use it to  You know  Strangle each other  They'd be choking people  Tie a few together  Make a noose  Hang a Red Sox fan  You guys think  No it's because  You know  The Yankees organization  And the Yankee fans  Are cooler  No they would hand  That stuff out  If they could trust them  I mean remember the year  When Wade Boggs  Basically you know  Pushed that freaking cop 
[00:33:00]  Off the horse  To celebrate after  The Yankees won  And he's tooling around  The field on the horse  On a horse  Even the players  Can't behave man  That was a good one  That was classic  Yeah Margo Adams  Maybe the Red Sox  This year could do  What they normally do  And turn their hats  Around backwards  For the big rally  Oh the rally cap  Douches  What douches  Shut up  Put the hat backwards  That'll make a home run happen  Ugh  Later today we gotta let  The Red Sox fans  And the Yankee fans  Go at it on the phones  You know what I want  That's always a lot of fun 
[00:33:30]  I want the two mayors  I want the two mayors  To make a bet  With each other  Yeah  That's always fun  You know  Tom Menino  Up there in Boston  Can wager some  New England  Clam chowder  Right  Yeah  And Bloomberg  Or maybe  An HIV infected  Prostitute  I was gonna say  Maybe  Maybe if the Red Sox  Lose  The mayor could tell us  Where Whitey Bolger is  Cause you know  Damn well he knows  Yeah 
[00:34:00]  A little inside  But the Boston people got it  They get the  They get the little  Friendly wager  Between the mayors  What a  Oh I bet you  It's gonna be  New England  Clam chowder  Yeah  New England  Clam chowder  And then what does  New York have  Manhattan  Clam chowder  Oh there you go  Maybe a New York  Cheesecake  Some New York  Cheesecake  I think Boston  Ought to wager  A legless nanny  In a dumpster  Yeah  That's always a  Popular Boston item  They ever find 
[00:34:30]  That nanny's legs  What did they find  They found half of her  They found her  No no they found her legs  They found the top half  Did they find the top half  Or the bottom half  Cause the bottom half  Had the DNA evidence  This was not a  Boating accident  They found the torso  Didn't they  When we were up in Boston  Was it  Yeah when we were up in Boston  A few weeks ago  Opie and I took  Club Soda Kenny  They were filming a movie  The Farrelly Brothers  Over by Fenway  And we took Club Soda Kenny  Over and we gave them  The historic dumpster shot  Of where Karina Homer  Was found  Right the nanny  The au pair 
[00:35:00]  Au pair  The au pair  And they  Yeah that happened  A few years back  And then New York  You know I don't know  A squeegee guy  Perhaps  Could go up there  And squeegee Menino's  Windshield  The inside of it  Because that big tongue  Of his  He spits all over  His windshield  Get a squeegee guy  To squeegee the inside  Well when's the first game  Tomorrow or tonight  Tomorrow night  At 8 o'clock  Tomorrow night  We're not going to get  A lot of sleep this week  I think we're going to win  I think this is our year  Oh god how many years  Have you heard that  I'm with them man  We got shilling  That's all I can say 
[00:35:30]  You're you know  When people said  This is our year  And they were right  With Boston  They were wearing  Those big stovepipe hats  And they were all  Smoking pipes  Smoking pipes  This is our year  I'm going to get on the horse  And go to the game  Last time the Red Sox  Said it was their year  And they were right  Everyone went to the games  In suit jackets  Yeah  Go in suit jackets  That took a long time  To figure out  That wearing a wool coat  Was not the smart thing  To do in the middle of summer  People used to dress up 
[00:36:00]  To go to occasions like that  The ball game  Or even the movies  The night out at the movies  And they were all dressed up  They used to dress up  Just living life  Yeah  All the old footage of New York  Everyone's in a wool jacket  And a tie  And a big  Effing hat  Yeah  See I didn't want to curse  Because you told me  I'm cursing too much  There you go  I listened to you  You know the last time  Boston said  This is our year  And they were right  Golfers were not permitted  To sit  And watch the game  With everyone else  Golfer only

[00:42:30]  I'll go get you a towel  Can you say fuck on this channel  Oh  Jesus  That's shocking  Holy fuck  I need coffee  This is the best show ever  The Opie and Anthony show  Today I was  No that wasn't me  Yesterday I saw a subliminal advertising 
[00:43:00]  The executive  Just for a second  I finally went to the eye doctor  I got contacts  But I only need them when I read  So I got flip ups  Keep them on my desk  Right next to my typewriter  I have the oldest typewriter  In the world  Types in pencil  Under my bed  I have a shoebox  Full of telephone rings  And whenever I get lonely  I open it up just a little bit 
[00:43:30]  And I get a call  That's how I dropped the box  All over the floor  And the phone wouldn't stop ringing  So I had to have it disconnected  I got another phone though  I didn't have much money  So I had to get an irregular phone  It had an O5 on it  I was walking down the street  And I bumped into a good friend of mine  He said  How come you never call me anymore  I said  I can't call everyone I want  My phone has an O5 on it  He said 
[00:44:00]  That's really weird  He said  How long have you had it?  I said  I don't know  My calendar has no savings  I get up the other day  And everything in my apartment  Had been stolen and replaced  With an exact replica  Couldn't believe it  I called my friend  And I said  Come here look at this stuff  It's all an exact replica 
[00:44:30]  What do you think?  He said  Do I know you?  It's a small world  But I wouldn't want to paint it  Just got out of the hospital  I was in a speed reading accident  I hit a bookmark  Flew across the room 
[00:45:00]  I've been doing a lot of painting lately  Abstract painting  Extremely abstract  No brush  No canvas  I just think about it  By the time I went to a museum  Where all the work in the museum  Was done by children  They had all the paintings  Up on refrigerators  I also went to a museum 
[00:45:30]  Where they had all the heads and arms  From the statues  That were in all the other museums  I left there  And I was walking down the street  And I saw a man  Who had wooden legs  And real feet  He asked me  If I knew what time it is 
[00:46:00]  I said yes  But not right now  I like my dental hygienist  I think she's very pretty  So whenever I go to have my teeth cleaned  While I'm in the waiting room  I eat an entire box of Oreo cookies  Sometimes I have to cancel 
[00:46:30]  All the rest of the appointments  Ovi and Anthony  I bought their asses for a half a pack of cools  I think she's a Tao PLAYER  I need to cancel  I like myficiente 
[00:47:00]  Like my Rancho  But now my��y  I just fixed  a bitch  My mother-a-a-esta- still ами  And let and honest  I know  All the rest  And I know  Metная  aula  Transl pedir  War  God  master  We're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  Next little glitch we've got to take care of.  Yeah.  Not as many glitches as we head into the second week of the Opie and Anthony Show on XM Satellite Radio. 
[00:47:30]  The ONA virus spreading across America.  The truckers are helping us out and our fans are helping us out, turning on new people every single day.  Thank you for that.  We greatly appreciate it.  Yeah, this is what we've got to do.  This is the next glitch.  Oh, the mic stands.  Somehow we've got to figure that out because it's driving people nuts.  But, like, you know, I'm sitting now, but then when we get really excited and get into it, I want to get up here and move around.  Sounds like what you hear through the motel wall. 
[00:48:00]  With the muffled.  Oh, God, doesn't that suck?  It's not as muffled as if you use the glass that they give you in the room.  Oh, I'm so cute.  It's like, oh, you're sticking to my car.  I'm so cute.  You know, if you took about it, I threw my proper carpet.  Oh, yeah, you're so cute.  It's not too cute.  You know, I'm so cute.  It's a fucking soap.  I'm so cute.  Oh, you're coming.  Oh, I'm so cute.  You're going to be a cold, my ass. 
[00:48:30]  I'm so cute.  Oh, you want any of this?  I want any of this?  I want any of this?  I want any of this?  Well, come here.  I'll pull out your beer with a fucking baby.  I'm just fucking fucking baby.  I'm sorry.  Totally getting into that.  I was getting into that in a strange way, too.  That's what you hear.  Hotel sex.  You hear it right through the wall.  Yeah.  Shut up.  There you go.  That was our lady piece, Superman's Dead, because we're the segmeisters on the Opie and Anthony  show.  Right.  And he is, indeed, sad news out of Hollywood, Opie, sad news. 
[00:49:00]  Ah, Superman.  Yes, Christopher Reeve.  Ten years after his, sorry, Jim.  Go ahead.  Was it ten years after his accident?  Ah, nine, ten, whatever.  Nine.  A decade ago, he fell off that horse, paralyzed him, and he's been in that wheelchair ever since,  and now he's dead, Opie.  He died at the age of 52 in, I think, California last night, or up there in Westchester, wherever 
[00:49:30]  he was.  They said, you know, too much detail on the news.  They said he was suffering from pressure sores.  Oh, that's like if you're sitting too long.  Ah.  You know?  Lazy.  Yeah.  Pressure sores.  Earl has those, from what I hear.  They weren't rolling him around enough in his bed.  He was laying in the same position a little too long, I guess.  Yeah, maybe in the chair.  That's not what killed him.  I guess it was a heart attack.  His heart went on him.  Or failure. 
[00:50:00]  So.  What should they say?  Huh?  I'm sure his wife had enough of his pressure sores and left him there.  I heard you.  I'm coming.  Oh, God, no.  What?  You know, she looked strong in the media, but, you know, a little taste of reality.  I, I, it's going to piss off people today, but there's got to be a part of her that's  kind of relieved she could go out and get some, you know, some action now.  Yeah, that black gardener can finally come in the house.  She doesn't have to do it behind his back anymore.  Literally just turn him around.  Not that I know, but I mean, you know, this is, you know, we're on this earth for just 
[00:50:30]  a few things.  I mean, it's great to have a career and this and that, but we're on this earth to eat and  fuck.  You don't know, though, what the arrangement.  Oh, my God, I cursed again.  I'm sorry, Anthony.  You don't know what arrangements they had.  They may have had an arrangement.  Perhaps they had an arrangement.  If they didn't have an arrangement, she, holy ass, she's going to do the wiffle ball bet?  Well, there's a slight, there's a slight problem.  What happened?  What's the problem? 
[00:51:00]  It's that time of the month.  That's even better.  So where's the problem?  Where's the problem?  I don't think she wants to do it.  I like that.  Then it looks like it really hurts.  Crime scene sex.  Oh, she might not want to do it.  Do we wreck our opportunity by not doing this on Friday?  We'll talk her into it.  We can do it again.  All right, backdoor, man.  Yeah, how about the dumper?  All right, anyway.  We'll talk her into it.  We're good like that.  There's a beautiful blonde outside that wants to do the wiffle ball bat challenge a little  later, but go ahead.  Maybe they had an arrangement, you know, because it's hard to believe she hadn't had any sex 
[00:51:30]  for 10 years, you know, so maybe the wife had an arrangement with Chris.  I'm sure they had a loving relationship and stuff, but, you know, there's two things.  In this world that every person needs, it's love and lust.  Could you imagine?  So she had the love because, you know, they had the relationship and all that, but she  needed the lust.  Could you imagine?  She needed the pounding.  Sitting, like, if they had this arrangement where Chris, they wheel him in the room and  some guy hops on her and he gets to just sit there and watch and go, all right, now put 
[00:52:00]  it in.  No, that's good.  Suck his gun.  Oh, you're a pounder.  Yeah, make sure you're coming.  Yeah, stick it to her real.  No, that's good.  All right.  No, jerk.  All right.  That is awful, man.  How awful is that?  Oh, you don't know, though. 
[00:52:30]  You don't know.  Yeah, yeah.  Might have had that kind of arrangement.  I don't know.  But, you know, a part of her is probably very relieved.  Oh.  And I'm sure he's very relieved.  Well, who knows?  Might be even worse now.  See, at the end of his life, he was looking more like the Crypt Keeper.  Yeah.  They showed, you know, that life is a bitch.  They were showing, like, video of Christopher Reeve before the accident.  You know this guy was getting poo-ha all over the place.  He was the young strapping Christopher Reeve from the Superman movies.  Of course he was getting some. 
[00:53:00]  And then when he first fell off the horse, he still looked okay, but...  Looked like Christopher Reeve in a wheelchair.  He just couldn't move as much, but then, man...  As much?  That's a really quite an...  I'm sorry.  Sorry.  It wasn't quite as mobile as much.  He was able to blink.  That was it.  I'm sorry.  Oh, he winked like nobody's business.  That's right.  Big eyelid muscles.  Yeah, I'm working out.  And then they showed more video of him when...  He went through a Lex Luthor phase. 
[00:53:30]  Oh, did he?  Where he looked exactly like his arch nemesis, which was quite ironic.  And then, man, he just looked like you look when you get the chemo with all the hair falling out.  Very sparse patches of hair on his head.  Old waxed fruit head.  And then he finally shaved it to look like Mr. Freeze there.  Yeah.  And now Christopher Reeve is dead at the age of 52 years old.  And, of course, at the forefront of the scientific research on stem cell research to get people that are paralyzed walking again.  But for some reason, you know, the president's founded in his wisdom to keep that from being researched as much as it could be. 
[00:54:00]  You know.  Oh, yeah.  Just give him a few strings to work with.  But, no.  Let's not really go all out and try to cure a problem.  I don't get it.  Bush has this whole religious thing that is such a huge influence on his presidency. 
[00:54:30]  Just stop it already.  Whatever you want to pray to at home or in church, go ahead.  But once you get to work, leave that outside.  And if you're the president, who the hell is he to say that we shouldn't be researching anything possible?  Pull out fetuses' toenails and see if they work on the common cold.  I'm for it.  I don't care.  Well, Bush gets text messages from God, so.  Yeah, apparently.  He's doing God's work for everybody.  Apparently they're in constant contact with each other. 
[00:55:00]  I'm all for stem cell research.  Up until the high school age, they should just be ripping out their little snotty spines and doing tests on them.  Creepy jizz bags.  Let's go to Delaware and say hi to Joe.  Hey, Joe.  What's up, buddy?  How you doing?  Good, man.  Yeah.  I was listening to you talk.  It reminded me, like, a few months ago, I saw Village of the Damned on the Sci-Fi Channel.  All right.  He was in that one.  Yeah.  I think they made that, like, right before it happened, right? 
[00:55:30]  Yeah.  I think all of his movies were made right before it happened.  Well, I saw it.  I didn't know what the hell was going on.  I thought, like, something had happened.  Like, he actually got fixed.  He got fixed?  You thought he got fixed?  Didn't they play a commercial years ago during the Super Bowl where they did some kind of digital work and they made it look like he got up out of his chair and walked off the camera?  And all the stupid soccer moms across the country started talking, going, oh, my God, did you see the Super Bowl last night?  Christopher Reeve is now walking. 
[00:56:00]  Did you see Christopher Reeve?  He got up out of his chair and just started walking.  He walked right off camera.  I saw the whole thing.  I'm going to call Marge now and tell her, Christopher Reeve is A-OK now.  Oh, sure.  He could walk down to the Walmart or the Sonic or wherever.  He's got to walk.  Shut up.  Shut up.  But he didn't walk.  Nope.  That's what I saw.  And Luke Skywalker climbed into an X-Wing fighter and started fighting against the Death Star. 
[00:56:30]  Shut up, stupid.  It's CGI.  Just like Chris.  He didn't get up out of that chair.  Nope.  When they yelled cut, he went, thank you.  I hope that's it.  Just a skull and a breathing tube and a blue screen.  So, sad news today, though.  Very sad.  You know, growing up, that was a great movie.  I remember the Superman movies.  Right up until the second one.  They're remaking the Superman movies, right?  Yes, they are.  Very excited about that.  With who?  Because obviously... 
[00:57:00]  I don't know.  Any...  Oh, Big Kev might know.  You're a Mr. Comic Book.  Who are they looking at to star in the new Superman movie?  They haven't mentioned any names for Superman yet.  Although there's a short list of people.  But the guy who did the two X-Men movies is directing it.  He defected from the third X-Men movie and went over to do Superman.  His name is Bryan Singer.  He also did Usual Suspects.  Nice.  And who have they got slated for the new Batman?  Oh, they got Christopher Nolan.  And what about starring us? 
[00:57:30]  No, the dude Christopher Bell, right?  Whatever his name is.  Christian Bell.  Christian Bell.  Christian Bell, right, right.  Yeah, they got him doing that.  That guy's great.  And Michael Caine as Alfred.  Really?  Oh, really?  You got a lot of useless information in that, Scully.  You know that?  Thanks.  Kev's comic book guy.  People are driving around now going, wow, my day is complete because I now know who's  going to star in the new Superman movie.  Somebody was going, hmm, cool.  And everyone else was going, care.  Get the Drill Doe girl back.  I just want to know how they're going to get Halle Berry into it. 
[00:58:00]  They're not.  They'll find a way to squeeze her in there.  Jim Caviazel is on the short list, which I think is pretty funny, you know, going from  playing Jesus to Superman.  You know the actor's name that was in Passion of the Christ?  Sure.  Jim Caviazel.  Dude, man, you got to get out of the house.  I haven't even seen that.  The Passion of the Christ?  No, I haven't seen it.  I saw clips of it and I'm like, I don't even think I want to see it.  It's good.  Brutal.  Excellent.  Not a lot of big laughs, but I mean, it's a great film.  I hear it's brutal, though. 
[00:58:30]  Absolutely, horrendously brutal.  Just when you thought the violence couldn't get any worse, it just goes to a level that  you've never seen before on film.  You know how it's going to end.  It's not like, oh, I hope he gets away.  Christ gets the girl.  I've only seen my dad cry twice.  He wanted to see Passion of the Christ, so I brought him.  Was the first time when you were tongue-kissing your grandmother?  Yeah, pretty much.  I remember that one.  Pretty much.  But we're sitting in the movie theater and he's just bawling his eyes out. 
[00:59:00]  Oh, you don't want to be there.  You never want to see your dad crying.  Never.  Ever, ever, ever.  God, is that a bad feeling.  He was just bawling.  And I was just pissed off the screen.  I'm like, I get it.  He got tortured.  Yeah.  I think we all understand.  We didn't have to be shown in that way.  I just like the fact that Mel Gibson did it.  Because, you know, faggot Hollywood didn't want any part of it.  We'd rather show another cop buddy movie.  The black guy and the Asian guy, but they're kind of like not from the same neighborhood. 
[00:59:30]  And he'll say funny things.  And then the black guy will say funny things.  Nobody wanted Mel Gibson's movie and he made over $300 million.  Fucking Hollywood, they are so out of touch with everything.  It's great.  It's just great.  Another faggoty cop buddy movie.  You're tall, Johnson.  We're hee-bitty-hoobity in my neighborhood.  Hee-bitty-hoobity.  Hey, I'm getting too old for this.  Yeah, all right.  That old gag.  And then he's got the hot daughter he has to worry about.  And then when the car goes over a jump or a cliff or a bridge, you've got to have the 
[01:00:00]  through-the-windshield shot of both of them going, oh, shit!  And the black guy will look and say something bug-eyed and wacky while the car's in midair,  bug-eyed and wacky.  Feats don't fail me now.  Would you like a little soft shoe, Mr. Johnson?  Sean?  And that's the character's name.  Awful.  You are absolutely right.  Yeah, that's what they want to do.  No chance of being taken. 
[01:00:30]  Nothing.  Except for, I like Weinstein a lot.  I love Miramax.  Those guys make some great stuff.  Yeah, they seem to have some balls.  Yeah.  I think Michael Moore should get brain cancer in his feet.  At least...  Those movies, you've got to take them for what they are.  They're entertaining.  Right.  They're funny to watch.  When you watch them, I find them funny.  And, you know, to take it as a political message and base your decision to vote on Michael  Moore films, please get a gun.  I'll wait.  Okay, now shoot yourself.  Right in the head.  Well, you know what?  Matt and Trey, in the latest issue of Rolling Stone, they've got that puppet movie coming 
[01:01:00]  out.  The puppet movie.  They make a great point.  They go, if you go to a Michael Moore movie and that changes your vote, then you don't  have the responsibility to be voting in this election.  Yes.  I really like that statement from those guys.  It makes a lot of sense.  A lot of people are like, oh, I'm going for Bush, Bush, Bush, Bush.  They go see one stupid movie or read one of those stupid liberal books, and the next  thing you know, they're changing their minds.  Well, those are the people that you see the polls, they change every time there's a debate 
[01:01:30]  or one of the candidates gets a little more press FaceTime than the other, you'll see  all of a sudden the polls will swing toward that candidate, and you've got to wonder who  these retards are that are so easily influenced that one little thing changes the polls.  Now, if the Michael Moore movie helps you make your decision, that's fine, but to drastically  change your vote just because you saw a stupid movie, that's propaganda like anything else.  If you see something in one of his movies, I would suggest you go to the internet and research 
[01:02:00]  it and see how much truth there is.  And this goes both ways.  If you see something that Bush said or did and you want more info on it, don't take their  side of the story.  Research it yourself.  Michael Moore says the same thing.  Yeah.  And he's also trying very hard to get the movie played on pay-per-view, a big four-hour  event the night before the election.  Of course he is.  He wants a little money.  And I'll tell you why Michael Moore says that, because so much of his horse shit has been  disproved and facts have been called into question. 
[01:02:30]  He has to say that to kind of cover him.  Hey, no, I'm just presenting.  He can't.  Right, I got it.  Please, we know why you don't want it to be going for best documentary, stupid, because  your facts are all going to be called into question.  Not because you want best picture.  He wants best documentary.  Yeah.  And I can't vote for John Kerry.  I'm sorry.  I can't vote for any guy whose wife looks like Eddie Vedder.  I have really had enough of that snooty bitch and her stupid, I'm high all the time, hair  in the face.  Beat it with your white suit, stupid.  I think Kerry's going to pull it out.  No, he's not.  I wasn't thinking that a month ago, but I think Kerry might pull this thing out. 
[01:03:00]  He's a dullard.  Nobody's going to vote for him.  Bush is looking like a lunatic during these debates, though.  Oh, my God.  With the eye twitching, and he takes everything personal.  He was taking everything personally.  And not only that, he wasn't listening to the moderator a couple of times.  But Kerry answers a question, and Bush, that's it.  He can't answer back.  They had done the back and forth thing.  And the moderator was ready to move on to another question, and Bush goes, no, I've got  to respond to this.  Grabs the mic and just starts walking and working the crowd. 
[01:03:30]  Good.  He's the president.  He's the most powerful man alive.  He should listen to some faggot moderator with that dullard with a scream-banned face.  I hate John Kerry.  I think it reflects on his personality in that he really doesn't pay attention to certain  rules that you must adhere to.  All right.  Goes off on his own, and thinking that his way is the only way, he seems to show that  in the debate.  He did go about that debate unilaterally.  I'll agree.  Unilaterally?  He wasn't listening to the moderator? 
[01:04:00]  Ridiculous.  I found it weird.  And then, yeah, they showed a split screen of Bush during one of Kerry's mindless rants.  A dullard.  What a complete dullard that man is.  He's going to smile a little bit more.  He stinks.  I think the Botox is starting to loosen up a bit.  I think he's starting to smile.  Bush should have just come out with a torch and a pitchfork and chased him around the  room until he ran to a windmill.  What a...  Iraq war. 
[01:04:30]  Wrong war.  Wrong time.  Fire.  Running.  Pitchforks.  Town hall meeting.  Just arm them all with pitchforks and torches to chase him.  Tax cut for rich.  No!  Ah!  Unbelievable.  Wow.  We've done two political breaks already.  What are we, crazy?  We really got to get the girl to do the wiffle ball bat challenge in a little while here. 
[01:05:00]  Can I say, though, that he is good with wordplay?  Like when he said, instead of weapons of mass destruction, his campaign's a weapon of mass  deception.  That's also WMD.  So I kind of thought that was pretty clever.  That's cute.  That's a cute one.  Whenever his wife comes out on the stage after the debate, aren't you just cringing?  I'm waiting for her to do something stupid.  Nazis are good!  You know?  Or just say something, or do something.  Oh, you make a great point.  She is one of those...  During the convention, I was just convinced she was going to blow it.  Say something stupid.  Right, right.  She'll go up and Carrie walks up to her and puts his arm around her like a guy would with 
[01:05:30]  the maybe future first lady.  And she pushes him away sometimes.  She pushes him away!  She is a cold, frigid bitch.  She's got no femininity to her.  Nothing.  No affection to her.  She's just like this nasty old bitch.  What's her job?  Alright, lay back while the ketchup guy puts it in.  That's where you're is. 
[01:06:00]  She probably just hit his ass.  Like it was a ketchup bottle.  That's how she gives you a handy.  She grabs your member and smacks your nuts.  Until the anticipation...  It's not coming out!  It's not coming out!  That was her job.  I bet you John's really passive-aggressive.  Like when she leaves the room, he probably...  He arcs one.  He scraps his...  Whacks his bag over her burger.  You know?  Oh, that's...  And you better hope it comes out. 
[01:06:30]  Because if it doesn't, she's pulling out the butter knife to stick up the front and  go...  Clang-a-lang-a-lang-a-lang-a-lang-a-lang!  Ding!  Awful!  And that Laura Bush is a piece of ass.  That's certainly helping the votes right there.  You know, she comes off as this school marm, though.  She comes off with no...  Like, there's no...  I'm not saying you ought to be out there in stripper wear, but there's no sexuality to  her.  And I think...  Dude, you get her behind closed doors, she's an animal. 
[01:07:00]  Yeah.  Definitely.  Now, Eleanor Roosevelt...  There was some sexuality.  Definitely.  You think behind closed doors?  Oh, without a doubt.  I can imagine them praying, though, while they're doing it.  You know, there's just too much religion there.  If you have too much religion, your sex is one of two things.  Either very boring or so perverted that you have to keep it quiet.  That usually involves small children.  That you have to go to church on Sunday and confess what you did.  Confess what you did.  On Friday and Saturday night.  And the priest goes, what's his young little name? 
[01:07:30]  I'll jot that down in my appointment book.  Father, I molested a child.  What was he wearing?  Ah, don't mention it.  All right, well.  How many miles of sea do you think the daughters have accepted, though?  His daughters are hot.  Bush's daughters.  Oh, see, now that's the unknown factor in the Bush family.  Although you probably know the unknown factor is they're wild.  And that's kind of cool.  They're like he was back when he was that age.  You want to see a reflection of Bush at that age? 
[01:08:00]  Look at his kids.  His daughters.  They're out there.  They're banging.  They're drinking.  They're doing some drugs.  They're getting arrested.  Just like George W. did when he was growing up.  I wish he would acknowledge that part of his life.  It would make him a little more human.  He tries to deny it.  There are public records of him partying when he was younger.  But then he doesn't even want to acknowledge it.  That's what happens when you find Jesus.  A lot of these guys that find Jesus, they completely forget about their past life. 
[01:08:30]  And before we wrap up this political break...  Is it a political break?  Talking about Teresa Carey holding your Johnson and smacking your sack like a ketchup bottle?  We're all about variety here.  That's our own political break.  Don't worry.  We'll get back to the smut very soon.  But another good point that Matt and Trey made in the latest issue of Rolling Stone.  What do you guys think about P. Diddy's vote or die campaign?  I don't know.  I never heard it until you just said it, but it's a little melodramatic. 
[01:09:00]  Exactly.  Vote or die.  No, it's been all over the TV.  P. Diddy saying vote or die.  There's t-shirts now.  How about stop shooting each other in certain neighborhoods and selling dope and go to college or die?  I think that you have more of a chance of getting killed that way than you do not voting.  This is just another way of somehow blaming white people for any problems that are in the black community.  You know what I mean?  Vote or die, meaning if that awful white man gets in, that awful conservative, we're all dead.  Not your own behavior ever affects the shit neighborhood you live in or the fact that you're urinating in your own elevators. 
[01:09:30]  That's somehow Bush's fault, too, I'm sure.  It's the white conservatives.  We're evil and awful.  Get that awful white man out of there or you're going to die.  Because Al Sharpton would be a great president if you want somebody to be accused of having shit dropped on their chest.  How is he still in politics?  I don't know.  He's barely in politics.  But the Democratic Party...  No, no, no, no, no.  They treat Al Sharpton like a legitimate candidate.  Not at all.  They did.  He was there for the goof factor.  No one took him seriously.  You know something?  They didn't even have to entertain him being there. 
[01:10:00]  Here's Al Sharpton's music, by the way.  Throw all the new listeners in.  I have a dream.  I have a dream today that people forget.  People forget about the Tawana Brawley debacle.  And how I'll blame white people for scraping racial epithets on her chest.  Remember them days?  Woo.  Yee.  Woo hoo hoo.  Has there been another cop shooting so I could go to the shooter's house and complain about how that cop was trying to arrest him for the drugs he had? 
[01:10:30]  Police brutality.  Police brutality.  I am the pole man's Jesse Jackson.  I could say Jaime Town, too.  No one was taking you seriously, though, during the convention.  Oh, now I feel like I'm talking to Sharpton.  I thought I was running for a second.  He was just good for some fun soundbites.  I was the goof factor, as they say.  He was definitely the goof factor.  Bring me the family of Amadou Diallo. 
[01:11:00]  I could use some money.  I am the family spokesman.  And they enjoyed him as a comedian up there in between the real guys.  They're just so afraid of being misconstrued as racist.  Can't exclude anyone.  That they let that jackass have a national stage at their convention.  That's why they're an irrelevant, awful party.  Well, here's what Matt and Trey say about P. Diddy's Vote or Die campaign.  And I completely agree with this.  I think just saying Vote or Die is a serious danger to democracy.  And then he breaks into the Cartman voice. 
[01:11:30]  I can't do Cartman, but...  Hey, 19-year-old, who doesn't know anything?  Anything you choose.  And then he says, if you don't know what you're talking about, there's no shame in not voting.  I totally agree with that.  There you go.  Sean Penn didn't like that, though.  They say if you don't vote, you can't bitch.  But you can bitch all you want, because this is America.  I think you're making a statement by not voting.  I said that on Hannity, and he wanted to chop my head off.  We'll get into the Sean...  I know what you want to do.  We'll get into the Sean Penn, but we do have to take a quick break, all right?  Can we talk about Sean?  We're going to talk about... 
[01:12:00]  We'll do a little celebrity break next.  There we are.  We did politics.  We did sex.  We'll do a little celebrity thing next.  Look at us all organized on the new Opie and Anthony show.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  I believe this is like when you first go to school, though.  It's like the new school year, and you start out, and you have good intentions for the first week or two.  Look, I got new...  All organized.  I got new corduroys on.  New corduroys.  You know what?  I'm at school shopping.  Look at my new school bag.  I see it.  It's still...  Look.  It has that leather smell inside. 
[01:12:30]  It smells like the school hallway does during that first week.  You haven't even put band logos on the front of your books yet.  No, and I'm not gonna.  And look.  Look at my lunchbox here.  It's a Partridge Family lunchbox I got with a plaid thermos that I put my Campbell soup in.  Everything's organized at the beginning.  Yeah.  I got my loose leaf folder.  You're so right.  It's with my dividers in it, and the reinforcements around the pages so they don't tear out.  When does this...  Trapper Keeper.  Trapper Keeper.  When does this show go bad?  November 1st? 
[01:13:00]  November...  What's the date today?  It's the...  I don't even know what day it is.  Yeah.  I'd say November 1st.  We start forgetting our books and asking for a pencil and paper.  Every day.  Every day.  All right.  So when we come back, we gotta talk about Sean Penn's letter.  We gotta talk about Susan Sarandon.  You're not gonna believe what she's up to.  Golf ball-eyed Susan Sarandon.  And also Star Jones.  Ooh.  She's a lawyer.  And Paris Hilton.  God bless Paris Hilton.  I'll tell you why next.  Ooh.  And also, Anthony, I think we got our first sponsor to the Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:13:30]  Wink, wink, nudge, nudge.  Setting up a cute little fake commercial here.  Yes.  Yes.  Klee Motors has come aboard.  Another thing we could not play on regular radio.  We used to be able to.  We used to.  Many, many years ago.  But then as the FCC tightened the nut vice down on everybody, this got thrown out of our  repertoire.  Now it's back.  Because we're uncensored.  There it is.  Klee Motors.  Hi.  I'm Ed Klee. 
[01:14:00]  Owner of Klee Motors.  Home of the Klee Jeep, Klee Volvo, and the Klee Taurus.  Let's see what some of our satisfied women owners have to say about their Klee Taurus.  I just love my Klee Taurus.  Hey, who wouldn't?  When I need to get away, I lean back and get lost in my Klee Taurus.  Many women say that a Klee Taurus is easy to maintain.  Here to tell you about the easy maintenance of a Klee Taurus is crack mechanic Michael Hunt.  Because your Klee Taurus is so sensitive, we recommend that you have it looked at in service 
[01:14:30]  at least once every three months.  If not lubed up regularly, your parts are going to get gummed up and they won't work.  And hey, that stinks.  Thanks, Mike.  The guys at Klee Motors are always eager to not only service my Klee Taurus, but it's the  fact that they take the time to polish it and buff it to a spit shine that keeps me coming  back.  Thanks, Ed.  That's what I'm here for. 
[01:15:00]  It was our anniversary, and my husband wanted to get me an unforgettable surprise.  I surged and surged, and admittedly, I had a little trouble finding it.  Imagine my excitement when you finally came across my Klee Taurus.  Thanks, Ed.  Don't thank me.  Thank my staff.  For looks and feel, you can't lick a Klee Taurus.  I don't drive my Klee Taurus.  It drives me wild.  A Klee Taurus is hard to find, but it is worth the effort.  Let me, Ed Klee, help you find your Klee Taurus. 
[01:15:30]  Today, at Klee Motors, off of Route 69, you'll find us right next to Cox Liquors.  Chubby gals need love, too.  That's quite possibly the filthiest vagina I have ever seen.  Hey, hey, hey, time for a few fart jokes.  Where would a comedy show be without a few fart jokes? 
[01:16:00]  Question.  Did you ever have to fart on a bus or an airplane or in some public place?  But you hadn't been farting all that day.  So you didn't really know the nature of the beast.  You only knew there was lots of it.  In a situation like that, what you have to do is to release a test fart. 
[01:16:30]  You have to arrange to release quietly and in a carefully controlled manner  about 10 to 15 percent of the total fart  in order to determine if those around you can handle it. 
[01:17:00]  Or, or if in fact you may be about to precipitate  a public health emergency.  When releasing a test fart,  it is often good to engage in an act of subterfuge,  such as reaching for a magazine.  Say, is that Golf Digest? 
[01:17:30]  That doesn't smell too horrifying.  In fact, in an odd way, it's rather pleasant.  I think they ought to enjoy the rest of this baby.  And it turns out to be one of those farts 
[01:18:00]  that would strip the varnish off a footlocker.  A fart that could end a marriage.  And everyone around you heads for the exits.  Even the people on the airplane.  As you realize, it is time to review your fiber intake.  It might not be necessary, after all, each morning  to eat an entire wicker swing set. 
[01:18:30]  I have no ending for this, so I take a small bow.  Thank you.  I appreciate that.  Thank you.  Okay.  100 channels of crystal clear digital audio.  XM Satellite Radio.  Radio to the power of X.  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:19:00]  It's fucking stupid.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Get down with the sickness. 
[01:19:30]  You're listening to The O&A Show.  Oh, wow.  Come on.  Hey.  I'm a radio genius.  I know how to seg.  Hoo-hoo.  Really?  It's the O&A virus spreading across America.  Big hi to everyone that turned on their XM Satellite radios over the weekend.  Tell a friend if you're enjoying what you're hearing today.  That's right.  Although you can't get any of the units in any of the stores on Long Island.  No.  I'm sure they'll... 
[01:20:00]  I hope he's gotten them all for free, so they don't have any more.  I'm sure they'll stock the shelves soon, okay?  Manhattan's the same way.  So is Boston.  Really?  Yeah.  Manhattan, you can't get them.  You can get plenty of the other company's products.  Of course you can.  Interesting.  Yeah, if you have a forklift and a station wagon.  Fucking eight-pound hunk of shit.  Got a little dog bark.  Arf, arf, arf.  Faggot.  Yeah, we'll get into that a little later.  Hey, I see something else that has made its way to the new Opie and Anthony Show.  Look what somebody brought me. 
[01:20:30]  The wacky horn is back.  Now, when anything wacky happens on the show, it can get the horn.  Just like inappropriate gets the bell.  And I hear soon I will have a slide whistle again.  Nice.  So I can play my Celine Dion music.  Every day, the O&A show, getting more gooder.  More gooder.  I hope people understand.  Anthony and I were on top of the world doing afternoon radio in many, many cities across  America. 
[01:21:00]  And it was all taken away from us.  And we had to sit out for two effing years.  No fault of our own, right?  No, not at all.  We had no responsibility.  No, we take no responsibility.  Oh, my God.  We sound like we learned our lesson when we do all these interviews in the paper and on  TV.  But trust me, none on us.  None on us.  None on us.  So they yanked the show and then made a sit-out for two years.  And then they took all of our stuff.  And I heard they just threw it in a dumpster. 
[01:21:30]  All the stuff we were proud of for doing radio for the last, well, we were in New York City  officially six years.  We did radio for four of those years.  I know.  But they threw everything away to make it even that much harder to get this show up to speed.  So every day we're adding little elements and things that we used to have on the old  show.  Right.  All right.  What's wrong?  I like your XM radio cup.  I'd like to have one.  Why?  So I don't spill stuff on the console.  Oh, that is a good idea. 
[01:22:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, but you don't have anything to ruin over there.  That's just the idea, though.  We didn't give Jim Norton anything to play with.  Nothing.  I got no screen.  He has a table in front of him.  He's got a console, a desk in front of him.  Like when Anthony, you know, does a Sharpton or one of his voices, I just sit here and  surf the Internet all comfortably with my mouse, enjoying myself.  You have to just sit there.  You have nothing in front of you because we know you have the attention span of a gnat.  And you did warn me before the show came on.  I was like, dude, look.  I mean, I can't give you a monitor or a computer. 
[01:22:30]  It'll just be on the line all day.  And then Oop's like, I'm not going to have one either.  Just hand.  And then it turns out you have one.  He's got one.  Cam has one.  Anthony and I both have jumbo screens in front of us.  You have nothing.  Yeah.  Because you would just troll the Internet for dates during our show.  You used to do it during the old show.  Chatting with some whore.  Yeah, I really would.  Yeah.  Awful.  A filth bag.  Awful human being.  All right.  So, well, this.  Oh, okay.  You want to do the Sean Penn thing?  Well, it goes into what you were talking about before the break. 
[01:23:00]  Listeners have let us down today so far.  They're 0 for 2.  They have?  0 for 2.  We're paying more attention with the listener contributions here.  If you're stinking, then you ruin it for everybody else, and we don't go to the phones as much.  But let's try Chris from Kentucky, see what he's doing today before we get into the Sean Penn thing.  Chris, what's up, buddy?  Oh, now you guys rock.  A brand new listener, and thanks to little Jim.  That's how I heard about you in the first place.  All right.  Thank you, little Jim.  Oh, thanks.  I'm a truck driver, and I don't get a chance to watch much TV. 
[01:23:30]  And I was at an old college buddy's house.  We were watching Tough Crowd, and saw Jim Norton there, and me and my buddy are both big fans of him.  Jimmy, you sick fuck.  Thank you, man.  Oh, cool.  Are you a good buddy, Chris?  No, sir, I'm not.  Well, I'm a good buddy in, like, the 1975 Smokey and the Bandit, you know.  When good buddy used to mean something.  Good buddy was the guy that let the Trans Am pull between the two trucks so that Sheriff Buford T. Justice wouldn't see him. 
[01:24:00]  That's right, so you'd be as safe as your mother's womb.  Wasn't he under the truck for a little while, too?  No, that was the other one.  That was so fast and furious.  No, that was Cannonball Run.  Oh, that's right, Cannonball Run.  Where they pulled the ambulance onto the truck and put a blanket over it.  You know, I got rooked into buying that DVD.  That movie sucked.  Cannonball Run?  It's awful.  Of course it sucks.  I thought it was good when we were growing up.  But the outtakes show them laughing, and you realize it's not as easy as it looks.  All right, Chris, thank you.  Hey, thanks for watching Tough Crowd, which Comedy Central is canceled, by the way, for November 4th. 
[01:24:30]  So I appreciate it.  Really?  That's it?  That's official?  It's about time.  Well, no, I mean, why would you want to have a show on the airways with a bunch of comedians  being honest?  Throw another fucking cartoon on.  You know, those are more fun.  America likes a good cartoon.  Hey, man, they do it to everything.  We kind of had the whole, you know, a bunch of guys having fun on our radio show.  They yanked it.  They yanked it for Blink.  Ugh.  Well, Viacom, too.  Now, what seems to be the problem with the cartoon?  Nothing.  Nothing at all.  Cartoons are fine.  My only problem is that stupid Americans only accept certain statements if it's from a cartoon 
[01:25:00]  character, because especially liberal white people, because they're so afraid of being  misconstrued as racist or politically incorrect that if they think if a cartoon says it, it's  acceptable, but if they allow a regular person to say it, them reacting to it is going  to be like a window into their own racism.  What do you think of Chappelle's show that is on Comedy Central?  Very funny.  It's a brilliant show.  Dave's a great comic, and that's what you get when you let someone do what they do best.  Now, why do they let him do that, and they don't let Colin or you?  Well, it's typical of anybody in show business, because people on the left will always allow 
[01:25:30]  things from black guys that they don't allow from white guys.  It's not a reflection on the black guy.  It's a reflection on the stupid liberal who's making the decision, because if a black guy  says it, well, that's the way black guys are.  But if a white guy says it, it's a reflection on them.  Right.  But Chappelle's show is brilliant.  I can't take anything away from the show.  I know.  Very funny show.  Sorry to see a tough crowd go, though.  Thank you.  Well, they were starting to give us notes.  Don't talk about race, because Dave's show does that.  Don't talk about politics, because Jon Stewart does that.  So we were getting all those notes. 
[01:26:00]  We kind of knew it was coming.  How many could talk about?  Furniture?  Exactly.  Current events and, you know, Paris Hilton.  All right.  Paris Hilton.  Next subject.  Dude.  God bless Paris Hilton, though.  I love her.  She does what all women should do in show business.  I was taking the train last night.  I spent the weekend on Long Island, came back into the city, you know, last night, and it  was kind of like a weekend night, because I guess it's Columbus Day, which means it's  going to be a puke fest out there once again.  And it's not like St. Paddy's Day.  They puke in the streets.  Parade equals puke.  Doesn't matter what kind. 
[01:26:30]  Spaghetti and meatballs on the sidewalk for Columbus Day.  Unless it's the Puerto Rican Day Parade, then that parade equals rape.  But the rest of the parades equal puke.  Every time they have a parade in New York City, people are puking all over the place because  it's an excuse to drink.  Did you see the drunks stumbling around when we got into work today on 57th Street?  It's kind of like a Saturday night when we were coming in, because no one has work  today.  Mamma mia.  This is going to be the, hopefully the Native Americans will protest this murdering Columbus.  Yeah, that's right. 
[01:27:00]  There's always the protest from the American Indians protesting Columbus Day, because Columbus  came over here and apparently hopped off the boat and just started shooting Indians.  I have no idea.  Well, and we celebrate that fact by having Thanksgiving, because they all got along back then.  Are they still teaching that crap in school?  Where we all sat at a big table with the Indians wearing the feathers and the pilgrims wearing  the big Mass Pike logo hat, and then they all had turkey together. 
[01:27:30]  Somehow, I don't know, people started shooting each other, but not then, not at that table.  The history books in general are so wrong.  Most people still don't understand that.  There's so many misconceptions in the history books.  But the best is this whole Thanksgiving thing.  You see the little kids around Thanksgiving wearing their little Indian wear.  The Indian things, yeah, yeah, the Indian headband.  I forgot what it's called, thank you, the head, no, what is it called?  The headdress.  The headdress, and they got the Indian makeup on. 
[01:28:00]  The buckskin with the tassels on the sleeves.  And they're hanging out with their little friends that are dressed like the pilgrims,  and these kids have no clue that we came here to conquer America.  You know, you could draw a turkey with your hand.  If you put your hand on the construction paper and trace it, it makes a turkey open.  Unless, of course, you're a 13-year-old surfer, then you better have somebody else do the  tracing for you.  Put that pencil in your teeth, stupid.  Wow.  People try to fix the history books now.  I really think you just got to leave that alone. 
[01:28:30]  It's so long ago.  And there's so much legend now that it just can't be fixed.  You can't now have, because the history books when I was growing up, that's what it was.  Thanksgiving was like that.  Columbus came to America, discovered America.  They just started building.  And no one ever got hurt.  No one ever got displaced.  You know, until last year, I thought we got along with the Indians.  Last year, huh?  Just about last year when I decided to get smarter.  And do a little research on history?  We came here to massacre the Indians.  And then when we weren't killing them fast enough, we infected their blankets. 
[01:29:00]  I don't care about that, though.  I got to tell you something.  It doesn't bother me, and I don't think it should bother anyone else.  Because at that point in world history, it was like the beginning of the game of Monopoly.  You know how it is in Monopoly?  You're buying stuff up.  You land on it.  Buy it.  Buy it.  And then the second half of the game, everyone has their own stuff.  And now you've got to deal with other people owning their own stuff.  Back then, it was, hey, whoever can come in here and conquer, it's your land now. 
[01:29:30]  That's what it was all about.  Go ahead, Jim.  I just wanted to point out, it's a good Monopoly analogy, except that in Monopoly you buy it.  You don't commit genocide to get Marvin Gardens.  I understand all that, Anthony.  I just mean the free-for-all that is acquiring the land, whether it's through purchase with fake money or slaughtering people.  You have to get the land.  Or anthrax in the blankets.  Now, what disease did we put in the blankets?  It was smallpox. 
[01:30:00]  Smallpox, right.  No, I understand all that, and I agree with you wholeheartedly, Anthony, if I must say.  Yeah.  But I don't like the fact that we're lying to all the kids and saying that it was a cute little thing, and we sat down and shared a dinner with these people.  You ought to be honest and say it was brutal back then.  We came in, and you know something, the strong survived, the strong conquered, the more clever, the more civilized were able to come in and use the tools that they were making to take the land.  Is it right? 
[01:30:30]  I don't know.  I'm not going to make that judgment, but it's what history was back then, and that's how things worked.  And if it didn't work that way, what, you'd have a bunch of Indians residing here in the United States, and the Russians would have come over and taken it.  You know, it's just, that's the way things work.  It was.  As long as, I have no problem with that either, as long as we look at it accurately, because, like, Hitler is judged pretty accurately in my history as being, you know, sure, a bit of an overachiever.  You know what I mean?  A painter.  Yes.  Stalin was, you know, all these people are judged accurately. 
[01:31:00]  Napoleon's judged accurately.  So as long as Columbus is judged accurately in history as being what he was, I had no problem with it.  I don't think we should give stuff back, but he wasn't a good guy.  It's very hard when so much time has passed.  You can make an accurate appraisal of Hitler because it was, you know, last century, the middle of last century.  Pretty recent history.  When you're going back to the 1400s, no one has a clue what was really going on back then.  1492.  Who was involved?  Okay.  Almost 1500s. 
[01:31:30]  You know, no one knows what was going on, so it's hard to make an assessment.  Just like you can't say everything was hunky-dory, if I may use that word on the satellite radio, I could say hunky-dory.  You can't also say that he came, jumped off the ship with a knife in his teeth and started cutting babies' heads off, you know?  Who knows?  I don't know.  I just know the end result.  We have a parade out here that I got to drive through when I leave here.  That's all that matters.  I mean, I'm sure that they came with peaceful intentions, and they saw those dumb feathers, and all right, I don't know, like, I just killed these fucking people.  They're irritating, and they're loud. 
[01:32:00]  I'm not saying it's wrong.  Sky is in the way of my wagon.  Shoot him.  Oh, my God, it'll rain.  We get it.  And you know it was just that simple back then.  You know, we here on land, we stay here under sky that our maker has just...  Shoot the son of a bitch.  I love to listen to you babble all day, but we got a road going through here.  Thank you.  Yeah, just skipping in a circle with those little boots on.  Get a hold of yourself. 
[01:32:30]  Shut up.  Yeah, get that creep away from me with the paint and the feather.  Stop that medicine horse shit.  Savages half-dressed.  Kill him.  So, I was on the train last night.  A little history for you.  That's very good.  Savages half-dressed.  You know it upset them.  They're all wearing suits and pilgrim hats.  Yeah, it's like 90 degrees and they're wearing these huge ruffles around their neck.  Mama Mia, we're here.  I'm hot. 
[01:33:00]  Oh, those dumbbells come along with no shirts and a little thing just covering their big brown slash red junk.  Mama Mia, it feels like I'm standing in front of the pizza oven.  I'm hot.  All pissed off because here comes Mr. Loincloth skipping down the trail.  You know all those pasta-eating guineas were fat and out of shape and here's Washboard Habs Indian skipping by with rain behind them.  That's why they killed them.  They were pissed off that they had better bodies.  Yeah, the women were asking, how come they have muscles in their stomachs showing? 
[01:33:30]  His engine sack bouncing up and down on his horse's back.  Yeah.  Red and tough.  War paint on it like it's ready to go into battle.  A nice piercing, a nice Prince Albert through the helmet.  And there they are, a bunch of dullard getting off a boat, eating spaghetti.  No wonder they slaughtered them. 
[01:34:00]  They were jealous.  Of course they were.  Classic.  All right, screw Paris Hilton.  Yeah.  Nah, the quick point I was going to make.  So I came in last night, you know, and it's like a weekend because of this Columbus Day.  There was a tangent.  Okay, now we're back on the railway here.  And Paris Hilton is God, man.  Because all the girls are now dressing like that.  She has influenced young girls into dressing like complete sluts.  When we were growing up, Madonna was the big thing. 
[01:34:30]  So all the girls had to dress like Madonna.  Yeah.  Awful.  Paris Hilton, though, with the short skirts and showing as much flesh as possible.  Let me tell you, my pants are pulled down to my crotch area.  Look.  It's fantastic.  It really is.  She has her pants cut down so low that you could see hair poking right out over the top.  Well, it's where the hair is supposed to be.  That's the best part about that.  You see smoothness. 
[01:35:00]  They take that razor and they shave downward a little bit there.  And then turn her around.  What are you seeing?  Supple ass.  Yes.  And that crack.  You're seeing a lot of inches of crack.  And above ass dimples and the thong thing.  I mean, it's great if you got the body for it.  You know, some girls see it and think, ooh, that's a good look.  That's the look for me.  It's not a good look for everybody.  If you have a bunt, do not buy those jeans.  Yeah.  Exactly.  If you can't see the waistband of it because your belly is hanging over it, no. 
[01:35:30]  You shouldn't have those hip-hugging jeans.  If you have a body like someone that gave me a massage last night, wear something a little  bit looser fitting.  Old Chief J Strongbow body came over.  They gave me an awful hand release.  Oh, that's classic.  How do you, don't you have, I don't know, do you need any visual stimulus with a woman  that you're with?  Yeah.  Whether it's a masseuse or something. 
[01:36:00]  So how do you look at that and get off?  Because she has a day job and I know that she's kind of uncomfortable doing it.  So it's almost like I just know times are tough and it's like, eh, put a little oil  on there, sweetie.  Times will get a little bit easier.  I know she's not thrilled doing it.  And the Levitra helps too.  I didn't take Levitra last night.  Oh, okay.  Although I'm hooked on Zycam again.  What is that?  It's nose spray.  Oh, the nose spray.  I took the Levitra just to keep a really firm rod during the massage.  But the next day my nose was stuffed.  Wow.  The Levitra makes your nose stuff. 
[01:36:30]  All right.  That's your background.  Alex from Boston.  You guys are confusing Columbus and the Pilgrims.  No, you can figure it out.  No, we're talking about anybody that came here to this new world.  You could do the math.  You understand what we're saying.  We're talking about John Standish.  Ugh.  What?  Captain John Standish.  Ugh.  Miles Standish.  Was that his name?  And John Smith.  Oh, did I mess that up?  Did I put them both together?  Oh, well.  You did.  And Pocahontas.  Yeah.  But anyway, thank you Paris Hilton for the new fashions. 
[01:37:00]  Yeah.  These girls have no clue.  Half of them have no clue.  Paris Hilton who made a career out of just being a whore bag.  Right.  A drunk hose bag.  But now, thanks to her, every girl out there can be a whore bag.  Or at least look like one.  She doesn't sing.  She's not an actress.  She doesn't do...  She is known for being a rich family's daughter from the Hilton Hotel chain.  And she's just a hooba.  That's it.  Now she's got her videotape.  And a new one's supposed to be coming out.  That was stolen again from a house. 
[01:37:30]  Wink, wink.  She must leave the house.  I'm leaving the doors open.  I'm going out drinking and screwing.  Yeah, I don't buy this.  You're going to be back for hours.  All these celebrity sex tapes, I'm not buying it for a minute that they're all stolen.  Not stolen.  They want them out there.  Someone figured out how to get their name in the press.  You know, the whole Tommy and Pammy...  Pammy.  Pam and Tommy tape.  That wasn't stolen.  There is, first of all, no reason whatsoever to tape yourself having sex. 
[01:38:00]  Let me say it again.  No reason to tape yourself having sex.  Unless you're Paris Hilton.  Or if you're Tommy Lee.  Yeah.  If you've got a Schwanz that looks like a wiffle ball bat, you want to tape it.  I'm talking about if you want it out there in the public, then of course you're taping it.  I mean, if you just want this and all of a sudden it gets stolen and you're like, oh, I can't believe...  You're not taping yourself.  You can set up a camera.  You can hook it up to the TV.  Start banging and look over your shoulder and go, hey, that's kind of cool.  There's no reason to have a tape in the camcorder while you're doing this. 
[01:38:30]  Unless you want that tape to get out.  Well, wouldn't you...  Nah, because I can understand that.  You're going to ever watch it again?  Yeah.  If you, like, see your Tommy Lee, right, and you know eventually you're going to wind up  knocking her jaw off out of sync and she's going to leave.  Don't you want to whack your bag forever, look at yourself, bang Pam Anderson?  I don't think Tommy Lee would or has to do that.  If he wants to, he would just go out and get another whore bag and bang her.  But it's Pam.  He's watching the tape.  It's Pam.  They never videotaped themselves.  It's like, what was it, Rob Lowe got busted.  Because even the girls wanted the tape of them banging him, which was a bad move by him. 
[01:39:00]  You know how much pussy Tommy Lee got because of that tape being out there?  You know how many girls want to ride that thing?  That was his resume, man.  That was his Louisville slugger.  That was his freaking resume.  Perfectly shaped with a gorgeous head on it.  Dude, he drove the boat with his dick.  It was huge.  He had probably like nine and a quarter.  Nine.  And she took it all like a trooper.  Dirty girl loved it.  Like a champ.  Took that hep injector.  Nice.  I didn't like her vag, though.  It was too thin an alien's mouth-like. 
[01:39:30]  I was waiting for her pussy to open up and go, take me to your leader.  Nice 50s alien reference.  Take me to your leader.  All right, so why not?  The last one to say that.  What do aliens say?  I want to get a driver's license.  And the ship came down.  I'm glad you let my awful driver's license improv go.  Boy, that stunk.  Nice job, autistic wit.  Covered it up with that great little noise.  So why not tape yourself, Ant? 
[01:40:00]  Did we go to that part?  Because you're going to get, if you don't want the tape out there, don't tape yourself  because it's going to get out there.  Plus, if you think you look hot doing it, half the time you play back those tapes, you're  like, oh my God.  You realize what professionals the porn stars in the porn industry are to be able to get  up there, give a good tooling, and get the right angles where, you know, people are  going to, male and female, are going to want to watch this.  Because if you get the wrong angle, and all of a sudden you're looking at what the proctologist 
[01:40:30]  looks at, that's a horrific sight you don't want to see.  You know what I notice when I watch these sex tapes?  What?  Everyone has pimples on their asses.  Yeah, see, that's another thing.  You don't want to have that.  Awful.  I don't mind that.  You don't want to have that.  Absolutely awful.  I don't mind that.  You don't want to have the thick thatches of hair growing out of there like the curb  edger hasn't been by in a while, coming out of your crack.  Oh, it's like a cracked walkway slate, and the grass is growing out of it, you know?  I've got to take care of that. 
[01:41:00]  I've got to put some lye in there and take care of that problem.  Same thing.  You don't want that angle.  You don't want the bob shot, the back of balls shot, where you're just swinging in  the breeze and everything horrible about the male anatomy is right there filling up your  new widescreen.  You don't.  You want the good shot where the, you know how the guy gets the hand on his hip and the  other hand is on the chick's ass, doggy style, and he's going back and forth and he's got  his legs positioned where you can see everything that's going on, but there's nothing really 
[01:41:30]  bad that you're seeing.  See, that's pro.  I don't like that one.  You don't like that shot?  Only because I don't relate to the perfection of it.  I like things, you know what I mean?  I want to see a guy like, you know, trying to keep his balance because his arms are being  used to toy with his awful nipples like I do.  I look like a praying mantis when I fuck.  No wonder nobody likes me.  Self-centered ass.  Playing with my own nipples.  No regard for the hole attached to a human that I'm involved in.  I really am garbage.  It's all about me, pig. 
[01:42:00]  It's all about me.  That is awful.  That is awful.  Just diddling my rotten little nipples while she lays there and pretends I'm anyone but  me.  All right.  We're going to try the phones again, Anthony.  Wilson from Tennessee, reasons to tape sex.  All right.  Let's see if he's got it.  Listeners have totally let us down this morning, but we'll give it another shot.  What's up, Wilson?  Wilson, you'll have a minute and a half for rebuttal?  That's right, Wilson.  Go.  All right.  How's it going, guys?  All right, bro.  This is the first time I've ever listened to your show.  I'm glad you guys are on XM.  Thank you, Wilson.  Tell your friends.  I like it.  I have been.  Yeah, there's many reasons to tape yourself, you know, during sex, especially people who are 
[01:42:30]  in the spotlight.  I mean, you know, NBA, NFL players, things like that.  Kobe Bryant would have never been in the situation that he's in.  All right.  I can agree with this guy.  Because they could have went to court, and he could have been, shut up, bitch, and I  got the video, you know?  You know, that is kind of a good idea.  Yeah, that would have been a good thing, because then he can say, you know, well, yeah, I fucked  her in the ass, but, you know, I got it on tape, and she wasn't saying no.  She's digging it.  Right.  There should be a sex tape storage facility where you can have sex on tape and store them 
[01:43:00]  there at a secured facility just in case somebody tries to file suit against you or have  you arrested.  You could break that out and say, no, if we can fast forward to five minutes, 30 seconds  when I'm plowing her keister, and she's going, oh, yes, put it deeper, that gets you off  the hook.  I like the way you think there, Wilson.  All right.  And if anybody needs anybody videotaping, I've got a camera, so they can contact me, you  know, whenever they need to.  All right.  Making a little pitch for himself.  Thanks, Wilson.  All right. 
[01:43:30]  All right.  I think we're going to take more phone calls because of Wilson from Tennessee.  He really did get the ball rolling nicely.  He certainly did.  Wow.  What are you looking at?  I don't know.  Paris Hilton kind of beat up.  Yeah.  Those are the.  Can I see?  Those were the photos that came out a couple months ago.  Yeah.  She's got like a fat lip.  Oh, I like that.  You know, she was just.  Did you watch her sex tape?  The second one?  Yeah.  No, no.  The first one.  Hell yeah.  You know, she was saying something like she was in that tape.  Just.  Ew.  And some guy went, ew.  Excuse me. 
[01:44:00]  I need to punch you in the face.  Who beat her up?  I don't know.  Supposedly.  What guy who knows how to take care of business did this?  Supposedly.  What's his name there?  The NSYNC guy there.  Really?  The Carter, the Backstreet Boy.  Oh, whatever.  Yeah.  He socked her in the mouth, dumped one on her face, and made her stay at a Sheraton.  All right.  We're going to step aside.  We didn't get to the Sean Penn thing yet.  No, we'll have to get to that because he is a real tool.  And we got a girl outside that may do the Wiffle Ball Bat Challenge. 
[01:44:30]  I hope so.  We're trying to spread out the dirt.  Spread the dirt?  We started the show very dirty, and we're trying to spread it out.  And we got Tom from New Orleans.  Tom from New Orleans.  Calling in in a little while?  Yeah, in about an hour.  All right.  God damn, they let you drink right here now, Paul.  Yeah, we're trying to find all our old friends from the last radio show we did.  Friends?  Yes, well.  I just can't see that drunken sot being up at 8.30 a.m. unless he's still drinking from last night.  He called Ben last night because the Saints lost.  He was all bummed out.  Yo, Ben, what's going on? 
[01:45:00]  You know, I'm very upset the Saints lost.  He was shit-faced.  Nolan Martin.  Yeah.  By the way, your pats didn't look that great last night.  Well, if-  Or yesterday, I should say.  If the receivers could catch the ball, Brady threw several passes.  Brady only had, I think, 76 yards passing.  They won 24-10, right?  Yeah, but they dropped a lot of balls.  19 straight games?  Yeah.  I don't know.  You can't really complain.  The record.  I'm a Cowboys fan.  How are we doing?  2-2?  Nice game yesterday.  I don't like stupid Testaverde.  I hope they go 2-14 this year. 
[01:45:30]  So Testaverde is smashed in the face.  I don't want him.  He's 51 years old.  They're surprised that the passing game is letting him down.  I know.  The first couple games, he did okay, as far as the passing thing goes.  But that's what the problem was when he was with the Jets.  He can't effing throw the ball anymore.  Older gentlemen.  Older gentlemen are great if you need someone to come over, put a few wrestling moves on  you, maybe show you how things are done.  But when you want a quarterback, young Quincy Carter was black and lean and he likes Coke.  That's what I want an athlete.  Michael Irvin did a lot of blow. 
[01:46:00]  He did fine.  Hollywood Henderson did a lot of blow.  These are great Cowboys.  Yeah, they're cleaning up the team a little too much.  It's irritating.  They're really cleaning them up too much.  A bunch of white guys who go to church and eat healthy.  It's awful.  Yeah, they need to get that Cowboys whorehouse back.  Where's Eric Williams?  Where's good old Eric Williams?  Commit a rape, have a car accident, and still win the Super Bowl.  We got a couple friends on the Cowboys.  Remember they were telling us the stories about the White House?  Yep.  They called this place the White House in Dallas.  Yeah.  I guess it was a really nice house that one of the Cowboys bought and just kind of gave  the team, and it was like the party central. 
[01:46:30]  And they called it the White House because there was a lot of blow flowing.  Ah.  A lot of mattresses on the floor.  They went to the mattresses.  Went to the mattresses.  Oh, that's right.  Remember that?  They said there was mattresses all over the place, and it was just a big, huge party house,  and it was like, you know, a lot of these guys-  Son of a bitch!  I got to say the word allegedly because I don't remember all the facts anymore, but  you know, a lot of the guys married and stuff saying, hey, honey, I'm going out with  the team, we're going to the club or whatever, but no, they went right to the White House  and started rocking and rolling over there. 
[01:47:00]  Bada-beep, bada-boop.  That's right.  Yeah, he wants to talk.  My Jets didn't look that great last night.  Nah.  But they pulled it out.  They pulled it out, yep.  Yes, they did.  Great final drive.  Great final drive.  True, true.  Were they 3-1 now?  No, man.  4-0.  4-0.  Wow.  Pats are 4-0.  Phillies 4-0.  When the Pats and the Jets play each other, they're going to both be 5-0.  That's going to be a great game to check out.  Well, you don't know.  You can't count your chickens before they hatch.  Oh, you come up with that one?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's a good one.  You ought to write that down.  Which one did you use before? 
[01:47:30]  I forget.  Oh, I forget which one you used before.  What?  Did I say something stupid?  No, it was just some cliche.  I couldn't remember what it was.  I was going to mention it and give a good ridiculing, but I forgot it, of course.  Yeah, but now when I do a cliche, people know I'm just messing with them.  No, but you weren't, though.  In this moment, you were actually just in the middle of a conversation, and one kind of slipped  out.  An opiism slipped out.  Yeah, I still got a few of those in me, so.  All right, so, yeah.  All the girls look like Paris Hilton, and we love that.  Thank you, whore.  Hey, speaking of Paris Hilton, trying to think how to seg into a Brother Joe song. 
[01:48:00]  Hey, she doesn't have a dry vagina.  No, from watching the video, it didn't look that way.  That wasn't one of my better segs, huh?  No.  I thought it was well-intentioned.  I tried.  Well-intentioned.  We're going to step aside.  Here's Dry Vagina from Brother Joe.  Another thing you can't play on regular radio.  That's why it was smart that you got the XM Satellite Radio, and that's why it's smart  to tell your friends to spread the ONA virus across America.  Right. 
[01:48:30]  We're pretty much the only DJs allowed to do this.  Nice.  Here we go.  Dry, dry, dry vagina.  Dry, dry, dry vagina.  So before my penis starts to get sore, come pick up some bags. 
[01:49:00]  I said, go get some bags and loop at your local drugstore.  Oh, you stink, baby.  There's a health concern that's kind of fallen by the wayside. 
[01:49:30]  It was big news a while ago, but it's still always present.  And that's the possibility that there may be a smallpox epidemic in this country.  Unbelievable.  A smallpox epidemic.  How could that be possible?  And the reason is because the smallpox vaccine that we were given and that I was told was going 
[01:50:00]  to last forever wore off.  And our government waited until a possible emergency condition to inform us.  Now that's a crackerjack group of fuckers, isn't it?  How could you fucking not call us?  Hey, Lou, your smallpox vaccine wore off.  You want another? 
[01:50:30]  You fucking wait, I want another!  Because my whole life has been a delusion.  Because every day I'd wake up and I go, you know, it's going to suck today, but at least  I'm not getting smallpox.  To wait as long as the federal government waited to tell us about this, it's as if you went to  a public bathroom and you flushed the toilet and the toilet water just hit you in the face.  And then as you walked out of the bathroom, on the door was a big sign, warning, toilet 
[01:51:00]  water may hit you in the face.  If I get smallpox, I'll file suit against the federal government because they took me  out of a very important class to get that vaccine, and if I'd taken that class, I wouldn't  have to do this bullshit for a living.  I'd have a real job, like with WorldCom or Enron or Tyco or Global Crossing.

[01:52:30]  Stop by Graveline.com.  XM 46.  The singer in question was Robert Plant.  The remarkable thing about my arriving at Pater's house was, A, that I'd been staying  the week before with Terry Reid and his parents.  Born in 1948 in Staffordshire, Plant had left home at 16 in order to pursue his passion for  singing.  Beautiful materials flowing from the walls and the howling wolf, incredible stereo blaring  out.  And there I am with an old battered suitcase going, what-o, mate?

[01:53:30]  8B in the East, 5B in the West.  Welcome to the O.P. and X.  Die, you son of a bitch!  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Not a police call, but it's all over the thought.  It's everything I wish I didn't know.  Oh, it's a joke. 
[01:54:00]  Give me something.  I can feel.  Feel.  Feel.  My bowel movements stink.  Oh, it's not bad.  We don't have enough time to take care of business in the bathroom still.  So we're trying to give you as much show as humanly possible here on XM Satellite Radio.  I leaked.  I thought I took care of the business.  Why is the wiffle ball bat girl like putting on a winter coat and leaving?  She has to go put quarters in the meter. 
[01:54:30]  Oh, okay.  I thought we were losing our first hot chick.  Bruce is loving this new job of his out there.  He's laughing his ass off.  He's like, she's like, can I show my boobs?  Bruce is just dying.  And Ben said, no, wait a little while.  Yeah, Bruce isn't used to this.  Well, you never say no to someone showing their tits.  I don't care if it's Olivia Newton-John.  You never say no.  They didn't have girls waiting outside for the wiffle ball bat challenge at Frank's Place?  At Frank's Place, no.  I was spinning for Sinatra.  Come on, take the bat, dame.  I want a broad in here that could take it in a keister. 
[01:55:00]  Just like Sammy did.  Yeah, Bruce runs the New York facility, and I think his job got much more gooder.  Much more gooder.  Since we came aboard.  He used to have to keep the Broadway guy and the Frank Sinatra guy intact, and that must have been a tough job.  Yeah, walking into the bathroom.  Take that out of your mouth.  Get back to work.  Oh, come on.  He owes me.  He owes me. 
[01:55:30]  I did him while he was playing some faggoty Broadway show tune, and now it's his turn to lick my bag.  Yuck.  That's right, stupid.  Sit there with the headphones on, face in the monitor.  Blech.  Yeah, the Frank guy's still being a bother.  We're just trying not to waste time on the Frank Sinatra guy today.  I won't talk about him.  He's still a bother.  He's an envelope of anthrax in the office of fun.  That's what he is. 
[01:56:00]  Boom-pa, boom-pa, doom-pa-dee-doo.  I've got another puzzle for you.  I am horrified looking out that window.  Boom-pa, boom-pa, doom-pa-dee-dee.  If you are wise, you'll listen to me.  Apparently, too, we're going to have to figure out a way to block out the window and the door so he's not offended.  What?  Oh, really?  Yeah.  He's going to be that guy?  No.  That's what I've been told.  Every place we work, there's always one person that wrecks it for everybody else. 
[01:56:30]  Oh, so he's not offended?  Oh, because it might be a sexual harassment thing?  Right.  If we show something actual fun between a man and a woman in here?  If he doesn't want to be offended, come to work at 10 o'clock.  Solves the problem.  Is he going to sit us down and make us go, XM Satellite Radio?  XM Satellite Radio.  Now, this is key.  Oh, whatever.  So my bowel movements are still messed up because we don't have enough time. 
[01:57:00]  I thought I took a leak and took care of everything, and now it's like my junk is dripping like a stroke victim right now.  I didn't get it all.  Oh, God, I don't want to hear this.  Little spittles on the left side of my left leg.  It's a nice and left, in case you're wondering at home, yes.  Awful.  Like old Chris Reeve if the wife didn't tap properly.  All right, let's go to Pennsylvania.  Hey, Rich, what's up, buddy?  Hey, what's up, man? 
[01:57:30]  How are you guys doing?  I just wanted to let you guys know.  First-time listener.  Love your show.  Oh, thanks.  We got stuck with Steve and DC and Bob and Tom here, man.  I'm so sick of these fuckers laughing all the time, man.  We're glad to have you guys.  You know what?  It's not even a competition anymore.  I really feel sorry for all the other DJs out there on regular radio.  They can't compete with us.  They just can't compete with us.  And that's one reason why Howard is keeping his mouth shut, because he can't compete with us on this level.  He just can't.  None of these guys can. 
[01:58:00]  So just tell your friends to get the XM Satellite Radio.  Tell them where it's at, all right?  Yeah, exactly, man.  But what about the Steelers, man?  Can't count them guys out.  Four and one.  Yeah, exactly.  I hate the Steelers.  Wow.  Was that Howard's commercial break falling?  His 20 minutes of commercial.  20 minutes of commercials are kind of hard to carry. 
[01:58:30]  Hopefully he can.  No, no.  Oh, that's going to take a while to clean up and then to play all those?  It's like 20 minutes.  You play your 20 minutes of commercials, you could regroup, I guess.  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh, my God!  Oh, my God!  Oh, my God!  Keep your mouth shut, because you have nothing to say for 15 months. 
[01:59:00]  Uh, did we lose Pittsburgh?  Yeah, Steelers four and one.  Whatever.  Yeah, but you know what you gotta give...  Whatever.  You gotta give the Steelers credit, though, every year, because...  No, you gotta give them a lot of credit there, Mikey.  That's right, Mikey.  You know, you gotta give the Steelers a lot of credit.  You know, why do you gotta give the Steelers credit?  Because they're a small market team, they have a good coach, they always put on a good team.  That's a small market team, but a good coach there, Mikey.  That's why you gotta give them a lot of credit.  Thanks, dog.  Uh, dog.  Ugh.  All right.  That show stinks. 
[01:59:30]  That fucking Francesca should die in a fiery boating accident.  He's awful.  Fat jackass, that perfectly coiffed hair.  Let's get into the Sean Penn letter.  This is our celebrity break.  Man.  Uh, he's pissed off.  Sean Penn.  Figure that one out.  Ha ha ha ha.  I love this song.  All right.  Let's get through it.  Let's get through the Fast Times reference with the song.  Uh, one of the greatest movies ever.  One of the greatest scenes in movie history took place to this music. 
[02:00:00]  Unless you're watching it on TV.  Yeah.  Oh.  Oh, my goodness.  Regular radio, Fast Times at Ridgemont High on regular TV.  Opie and Anthony show, Fast Times at Ridgemont High.  The video version.  There you go.  The DVD version.  The DVD.  Aw.  Hi, Brad.  Ha ha ha ha.  Doesn't sound as hot, Anthony.  Phoebe Cates.  Couldn't we get the sound clip instead of you imitating the chick? 
[02:00:30]  Phoebe Cates when she snaps that top open.  Yeah.  Nice.  Well, Sean Penn's all pissed off.  As usual.  Is that the hottest scene in movie history?  No.  One of them.  No, of course not.  It's pretty hot.  That was a question just to start a little conversation, Anthony.  Oh.  That scene's pretty hot.  That wasn't me.  That was Jim.  I know.  I'm sorry.  That was pretty hot, dude.  Not like in a sex way where, you know, it's not like they're having sex or anything.  All right.  Hotest scene in movie history, really fast. 
[02:01:00]  Don't say a porno.  Regular movie.  No, I'm trying to think.  I'll have to think.  It'll have to give me a few minutes.  Don't say nine and a half weeks, either.  I don't remember that.  That friggin' kitchen refrigerator food scene.  Keep food and sex separate.  The old man always rings twice was pretty sexy.  When he's banging Jessica Lange on the table.  That was hot.  That was very hot.  She's getting, like, dough all over her.  Bridges in Madison County when Clint Eastwood was showering by the pump.  No, huh?  That movie should have been called The Good, The Bad, and The Horrific. 
[02:01:30]  Ugh.  I don't like his old man in shape body.  It's not in shape.  You missed this discussion on Friday.  His baloney tits?  He's not in shape.  He wasn't in shape.  Hey.  Hottest scene in movie history, Anthony?  Tuffy.  I think when the white suburban chick was getting banged by the black drug dealer in traffic.  Oh, that's a good one, but that's too disturbing.  Disturbing, right.  It's too disturbing to be hot.  Yep.  Too disturbing.  That was...  I've watched that scene probably, I don't know, 20 to 30 times. 
[02:02:00]  Ugh.  Are you yelling, lucky girl?  Or was it below?  I always forget traffic.  Yeah, traffic.  You know what was a hot scene?  It was in Leaving Las Vegas.  What was the prostitute?  It was Nicolas Cage.  Elizabeth Shue, when they pulled her pants down for the anal scene in the kitchen.  Oh.  Remember that?  And with the knife?  That was really hot.  Because she's just such a great body.  That's hot.  Yeah, it was really sexy.  God, I don't know.  I don't even have a good one.  Well, this is the obvious one. 
[02:02:30]  This is probably my second best one ever.  Let's go to R.G. in Queens.  Hello.  Hello, guys.  Hey.  What's up, man?  Uh, hottest scene in movie history.  The, uh, the threesome and wild things.  Yeah, it's pretty good, but not, not, not as hot as I remembered it.  I just saw that again recently.  Oh.  And Neve Campbell is just a downer.  She's not very hot.  She's kind of dykey looking.  She doesn't have a good body.  Huh?  I wouldn't turn it down in the threesome with the friggin', what's her name? 
[02:03:00]  Who's the other one that's in there?  Neve.  Yeah, Denise.  Oh, Denise Richards and Neve Campbell.  Richards, yeah.  Yeah, Denise Richards now is hot in that whole movie.  When she's washing the, the jeep in the shorts.  That is an amazing scene.  That's a great scene, man.  Oh, and Kevin Bacon naked in the shower.  Ugh.  Showing his junk.  And then Matt Dillon walks in, hey, how you doing?  That was, that was just awful.  I'll tell you some hot scene in movie.  They're very, they're rated R movies.  They were the Emanuel series that I used to whack my bag to on cable. 
[02:03:30]  That's soft corn, uh, soft corn, soft corn cable porn.  Oh, you don't count that?  You're talking about regular, regular.  Yeah, because then you could go like, you know, remember cheerleaders?  Okay, okay.  Movie cheerleaders?  All right.  Movies with, uh, you know, people that somebody's heard of.  Yeah.  All right.  Like hot.  Cool.  I almost had one.  Let's go to Paul.  Hey, Paul.  I gotta go.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  What's up?  Uh, it's much.  Linda Blair getting fucked by a broom handle.  Oh, that was, uh, Chained Heat?  Yeah.  I don't think it was graphic enough to really be hot.  Yeah, this guy, Mike, from Jersey City, has a good movie. 
[02:04:00]  That movie, I didn't understand at all.  Mulholland Drive?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Mike.  Yo, what's up, guys?  What's up, man?  The most disturbing movie in history.  I still can't understand it, no matter what I read about it.  But that lesbian scene in Mulholland Drive.  Very hot.  That's a full box of tissues for that scene.  Very, very hot.  That lesbians equal ratings.  That's right.  I remember one. 
[02:04:30]  Oh, that's gonna make me...  Uncut Monsters Ball scene?  Oh, oh.  Very sexy.  Billy Bob?  Yeah.  Halle Berry's getting banged.  I hate Halle Berry, but that scene is amazing.  You guys are forgetting the hottest one.  Huh?  Shawshank Redemption.  Tim Robbins getting what he really deserves for his stupid political pontificating.  I don't know.  No, as far as prison anal rape, male-on-male anal rape goes, it's gotta be American History  X.  Yeah, it was a good one.  Or Edward Norton.  Yeah, because they show up against the wall and you can actually see the taut buttocks. 
[02:05:00]  When the white supremacist guy just rams it home and he goes, oh!  Yeah.  You can just picture yourself in that place.  Taking it like a man.  You can't fight it off, but your body adjusts.  God, that's awful.  All right.  Enough of that.  All right.  So, are we ready for stupid Sean Penn?  Yeah, stupid Sean Penn.  Let's go.  Well, Sean Penn has a problem with Trey Parker and Matt Stone. 
[02:05:30]  They put out that Team America movie, the puppet movie.  The movie looks like the Thunderbirds and all those fun shows you used to watch as a little  kid.  Remember that?  They used to have puppets on television, the Thunderbirds.  I was going to say, yeah, the Thunderbirds.  Yeah, it's kind of like that, only it's dirty, offensive, and just like Matt and Trey.  Getting good reviews, though.  Getting good reviews.  Except from people like Sean Penn, who has a big problem with it. 
[02:06:00]  You want that up?  You want me to?  Did you have a problem with the movie or them?  Yeah, there's a seven-minute puppet sex scene that they had to cut for the R rating, to get  the R rating.  But I'm sure the DVD will show it in its entirety, and I hear it's really graphic puppet sex.  Very graphic.  They show everything.  They show puppet vag.  That's what I hear.  Puppet vag.  Yeah, I don't know.  If Matt and Trey are making a puppet movie, they have to show naked puppets.  Yeah.  So I think there's a graphic sex scene, like a porno sex scene with puppets. 
[02:06:30]  I was reading the article in Rolling Stone, and they're kind of bummed because they're trying  to get the R rating, and you got the...  What are they?  They had to cut the puppet sex scene out, but they're going to put it on DVD.  They had to cut some of the puppet sex scenes out so they could get the R rating because  the board out there...  Motion picture, so she...  Yeah, whatever.  It's a relevant group.  So I think they wanted a golden shower scene or a dump scene on...  There's a couple.  There's a couple scenes they had to cut.  Yeah.  It'll be good for the DVD when it comes out, but supposedly there's a golden shower scene 
[02:07:00]  they had to cut out of the movie.  Damn.  One puppet peeing on another puppet.  Jesus.  I love those guys.  Puppets.  So Sean Penn, very disturbed about the new movie, Team America, and he wrote an open letter  to Trey Parker and Matt Stone.  Listen to this.  It's so obnoxious.  Well, I think it's the Rolling Stone interview they did.  I don't know if it's the...  Is it the movie or the Rolling Stone interview?  What?  It's the Rolling Stone interview he's commenting on.  Sean Penn is annoying.  He's not commenting on the film.  It's the actual interview that they did. 
[02:07:30]  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, but he also doesn't like the film.  Of course he doesn't.  All right.  Here's Sean Penn.  I remember a cordial hello when you guys were beginning to be famous guys around Hollywood  at some party.  Like, that's a blow-up right there.  Eh.  Remember?  Eh.  I sort of kind of started noticing you guys were getting famous.  Yeah.  I acknowledge you a little bit.  Yeah.  You should be thankful that I acknowledge you.  Oh, his ass is in Hollywood.  They got a whole tier of, you know, popularity and celebrity hood out there.  Aloha, Matt and Trey.  That's what he said when he met him. 
[02:08:00]  I remember several times getting a few giggles out of your humor.  Oh.  I remember not being bothered as you traded on my name, among others, to appear witty,  above it all, and likable to your crowd.  He traded on his name like they're cashing in on Sean Penn.  They name drop every episode.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's part of their show.  It's not like they single out stupid Sean Penn.  And I wonder when else he got a few giggles.  Maybe when his hairy, armpitted wife showed up in Penthouse, when they made Shanghai Surprise. 
[02:08:30]  You get a few giggles then, did you?  A few chuckles.  Just a few little chortles.  Oh, you were talking about Madonna.  You scared me, because his latest bride there is a piece of hair.  Yeah, she's very hot.  Oh, my God.  All I need are some tasty waves, a cool buzz, and I'm fine.  I never mind being of service in satire and silliness.  Oh, boy, Sean.  Thank you for that.  I'm so glad you can take a joke sometimes.  Chris, what's going on?  Hey.  Hey.  I went and saw a sneak preview of Team America yesterday.  All right. 
[02:09:00]  Tell us what it's about.  Good, Ben.  Well, you know, Team America, World Police, they police the world and try to save the world  from terrorists.  And, you know, the world's pissed off at us, because, you know, we're getting everybody's  business.  He makes it sound so thrilling.  I'm going to go out right now, and Matt and Trey are like, gee, thanks for the review,  Dick.  Well, like, it's all the same joke.  Was it a good movie?  It's all the same joke from South Park.  Like, they have a two-minute AIDS song, and, you know, they did that in South Park.  And it's, you know.  All right, listen, listen, listen, listen. 
[02:09:30]  Help us out here.  We get Matt and Trey's humor, so was it good or bad?  It was, you know, if you've seen South Park, I don't think it's that great.  It's not offensive enough.  Okay.  Ah, not offensive enough.  Thank you.  Very good.  No.  And, you know, the puppeteen sex is still in it, and it's kind of disturbing.  Okay.  But, you know, you don't see...  Thank you, Wofy.  He blew it for everyone.  On the clock.  No more phone calls for five minutes.  Stand in a corner.  Callers.  Stand in the corner.  It's a timeout. 
[02:10:00]  All right, getting back to the Sean Penn letter.  I do mind when anybody who doesn't have a child doesn't have a child at war or isn't or  won't be in harm's way themselves is encouraging that there's no shame in not voting.  If you don't know what you're talking about, Mr. Stone, without mentioning the shame of  not knowing what you're talking about and encouraging people to know, you guys are talented  young guys, but alas, primarily young guys.  It's all well to joke about me or whomever you choose, not so well to encourage irresponsibility  that will ultimately lead to the disembowelment, mutilation, exploitation, and death of innocent 
[02:10:30]  people throughout the world.  The vote matters to them.  No one's ignorance, including a couple of hip cross-dressers, is an excuse.  All best and a sincere fuck you, Sean Penn.  P.S.  Take this as a personal invitation from me to you.  This is the best part of the letter.  You can ask Dennis Miller along for the ride as well to escort you on a trip, which I took  last Christmas.  We'll fly to Ammon, Jordan, and I'll ride with you in a 12-hour, I'll ride with you in a 
[02:11:00]  what?  12 hours through the Sunni Triangle into Fallujah and Baghdad, and I'll show you around.  When we return, make all the fun you want.  Yeah, next.  Signed, Sean Penn.  Next, we're going to wing on over to Ammon, Jordan, and then we're going to go to Fallujah  and Baghdad, and then it's off to London, jammed with the stones.  So what Bush is saying is, hey, you know, we went to this Baghdad place because it's 
[02:11:30]  bogus, and if we don't put our own cool rules in pronto, then we'll just be bogus too.  Yeah.  What a tool!  What a sanctimonious asshole.  Uh, what do you think of Bush and Cheney?  Those guys are fags!  We'll just get that jacket.  It's friggin' Spicoli!  Spicoli is, uh, uh, pissed off.  Oh, Mr. Hand. 
[02:12:00]  Mr. Hand.  I'm so wasted!  Awesome!  Totally awesome!  All right, Carrie.  Carrie throws some hot coffee in Bush's face at a debate.  Yeah.  Yes, Jim?  It's just annoying that he's talking about having gone to Baghdad and Fallujah.  Oh, I know.  And you were used as a PR weapon by Saddam Hussein, you ass. 
[02:12:30]  And I was in Baghdad, so maybe I'll go over there with you too.  Sorry, I wasn't whoring around with an uncircumcised Iraqi dictator.  I was entertaining American troops.  Sanctimonious jerk-off he is.  So I was in Kirkuk and Talil in Baghdad.  I didn't get the VIP treatment, and I'd love to see you go into Fallujah now.  Yeah.  I'd love to see, what are they, Tawid and Jihad?  I'd love to see those savages get their hands on you and lop that fucking head off and hold it up.  You know that would happen. 
[02:13:00]  With those dumb sunglasses on, you Hollywood jizzbucket.  There you go.  My feelings exactly.  Arrogant, pompous, left-wing, dullard, and you didn't deserve the Oscar for Mystic River.  It sucked, and it was overrated, and it was a gift for being so outspoken and so brave.  Puff!  What's brave about being a liberal in Hollywood?  What's brave about it?  Nothing.  They used to be anti-establishment.  You know what, jerk-off?  Now you are the establishment.  You're everything you railed about in the 60s. 
[02:13:30]  That's what you've turned into.  Boy, I'm sure not a big fan of the far right.  Right.  But the far left is just as bad.  Thank God you said just as bad.  All those dickheads in Hollywood.  Barbara Streisand is another one.  Golf bald-eyed Susan Sarandon and Mr. Susan Sarandon.  Are you singing into the Susan Sarandon story?  I guess so.  All right.  Hold on.  Someone has one comment about back to Tennessee. 
[02:14:00]  Let me just say, they are so out of touch with what everybody does in this country on  a day-to-day basis.  They are so separated and insulated from life that everyone else in this country leads that  when they spew their ideology, no one can relate to it.  It's so out there.  It's so ridiculous and so unreal.  Just shut up.  Make another movie.  Entertain us.  We'll pay our money to see it.  And keep your yaps shut. 
[02:14:30]  And the problem, what I have with a guy like that, is Marlon Brando was said about acting.  He said, acting is a worthless profession.  That's what Brando, the greatest of them all, said.  So why don't you realize...  How did anyone read it after he ate the paper it was on right after he wrote it?  Acting is a...  What was I writing?  Stop.  You're spilling it.  I love you, Grandpa. 
[02:15:00]  Your grandson, Frank.  That's what I've never heard on the show before.  Awesome.  Let's go to Tennessee.  Tennessee has let us down today, but we're going to say hi to Tennessee again.  What's up, buddy?  Not much.  I just want to comment on that Sean Penn, man.  He ought to be hiding his face.  I mean, Mystic River ought to be getting an Academy Award compared to the damn 21 grams that he put out.  I mean, that was just horrific.  That movie was disturbing. 
[02:15:30]  I like that more.  I did like 21 grams.  I thought Mystic River stunk and was predictable and cheated at the end.  I thought it cheated by not giving you enough information to figure it out.  You know what I'm saying?  Usual suspects, you could possibly see the twist coming because you did see space, you threw the whole film.  But Mystic River throws this non-curveball at you that there's no way you could have possibly known.  So they make it look a certain way the whole film, and then they throw in this X-Factor at the end.  They introduce it in the last five minutes.  So it was a bullshit non-twist.  I hated that flick. 
[02:16:00]  What didn't you like about 21 grams, Sean?  Whatever your name is.  The whole movie, I go by Super Chicken out here on the road, so I just call in a Super Chicken.  And 21 grams, I mean, it's just a big flop.  There's a drug on the whole damn movie.  If I was him, I'd just flog myself and hide in a closet until I could think of something better to show on the street.  That movie was so depressing.  Yeah, it was very sad.  It was just a great show, guys.  Glad I paid that $2 a month.  You know, happily be paying it from here on out. 
[02:16:30]  All right.  Thank you.  Tell your friends, all right?  I'll take it easy.  Tell your fellow good buddies.  Two bucks a month.  Two whole bucks a month.  I feel like a young Thai boy for that price, don't you?  Right.  Young boy in Thailand giving it up for two bucks a month.  I feel like we should be making sneakers or something.  We're the same amount to buy us as it takes to feed a South American village.  $2 a month, says Sally Struthers.  How much is that a day?  That's five days in a week. 
[02:17:00]  Yeah.  I probably should have had this worked out before I mentioned it on the airwaves.  Probably should have, Mr. Math Head.  It would be.  Look at the steam coming out from under his headphones trying to figure this complicated calculation.  It would be $0.07 a day.  Okay.  For $0.07 a day, you can get Opie and Anthony.  Or feed this little kid with the flies on his face.  That's right.  But you want to laugh, don't you?  You don't want to be depressed watching starving children.  So turn them off and turn on Opie and Anthony.  All right.  Here it is.  I think they...  Oh. 
[02:17:30]  Go ahead.  I think they'd do a little better if they said...  And we'll send you a photo of the child you're helping in the outfit of your choice.  Oh, my God.  Could you dress him up in little knickers?  I want him in little knickers and a halter top.  Oh, that's funny.  Yankee hat and nothing else.  Oh, God.  You know, I'm a little distracted today.  Master Poe is outside the window showing how he kills people with his hands.  Did anyone else see that?  I didn't see it.  Look how he's dressed today. 
[02:18:00]  Oh, he's got a black T-shirt on and cami fatigue pants.  He ain't messing around.  Nice.  He just showed how you can just kill someone.  There he goes.  He's bowing.  That other guy's a rough character, too.  That's Strapping Buck.  He's the boyfriend, I think, of the girl that came.  He's a big boy, too.  Isn't that great?  We got half the cast of Predator out there.  That's true.  Well, we're waiting for the girl to come back to do the wiffle ball bat challenge.  I think we've spread out the dirtiness enough and we could...  Oh, we could dive back in, if I may say.  We could break in the wiffle ball bat in a little while. 
[02:18:30]  What kind of a curmudgeon, what kind of a boar complains about what other people are doing?  Why would you care what other people are oomph?  Why would you care?  Of course.  What kind of a boar are you?  He's the type of guy that would come into an office early and cockblock everybody else's  fun with his comb over and his rotten beard.  I bet Sean Penn plays this music around his house.  Sure.  Stumbles around.  Doompa, doompa, doompa, dee, dee.  If you are wise to listen to me. 
[02:19:00]  Okay.  Golf ball died.  Susan Saran.  Yeah, she's in the news as well.  Check this one out.  The headline is, One Hot Mama.  One Hot Mama.  Maybe 30 years ago.  Yeah.  I'll give her 20 years ago.  20?  What movie was her last, like, hot movie?  Rocky Horror.  Thelma and Louise.  She was already, she had already hit the wall.  She wasn't that bad in that movie.  Yeah.  I didn't.  Sticks. 
[02:19:30]  Couldn't win.  It's so low, though, Steve.  I have never kissed before.  There we go.  You mean you've only ever kissed?  I thought there's no use getting...  Boring!  Jesus.  Nice.  Not from the movie, first of all.  Oh, it's not?  And great queuing it up to the part.  Yeah, it was good.  Sorry about that.  My T-cell count dropped listening to that.  Can it drop any further, Jim? 
[02:20:00]  Wow, the oxygen just got sucked out of the room.  Thanks for the participation, Steve.  You're doing a great job.  What about Susan Sarandon?  Okay, so the headline, One Hot Mama.  At the ripe old age of 58, Susan Sarandon is...  58 she is?  At the ripe...  She's two years from 60?  At the ripe old age of 58, Susan Sarandon...  She's full of shit.  Susan Sarandon is still being pursued to pose for Playboy.  Maybe she meant century sex. 
[02:20:30]  She going to be in that one?  She doesn't really think that Playboy is still after her, does she?  Stop it.  Maybe swank.  They have been talking to me for years.  I got a lot of lunches out of Playboy.  Take those power lunches.  But Sarandon says that even if she decided to pose, her children would definitely have  a word or two to say about it. 
[02:21:00]  Duh.  Even Larry Flint wouldn't roll on top of her.  Oh, they're called back on.  I'd like to put you in Hustler magazine.  Swear, you're 58 years old?  That's hot.  I bet your vag droops like my lip.  No one wants a 50...  I'm sorry, 58-year-old women.  Or should I say woman listening to the show? 
[02:21:30]  Yeah, we've probably got one or two.  Might be one.  But, you know, you've got to be realistic.  Your Playboy days are behind you.  Right.  Face it, we've reached the second plateau.  I think 50 is the cutoff for Playboy.  Vicky LaMotta did it.  The real Vicky LaMotta when she was about 50 years old.  She was great.  I saw it.  No, let me tell you.  I saw that spread.  I love it.  I remember it vividly because I remember thinking how awful it was.  She was wearing this net thing that kind of held everything together or tried to.  You could tell she wasn't naked. 
[02:22:00]  She wasn't letting herself kind of fall.  Everything was wrapped up in some type of clothing.  So that's fine.  I mean, you know, please, I want to see anyone naked who LaMotta belting around for a few years.  You've got to respect that.  Can I wipe my tits?  I've got black and blue on.  How old was Farrah Fawcett, though?  She was in...  About 50.  Listen, you animal!  Shut up!  He's pouring the champagne.  He presents the sneeze.  Shut up, you animal! 
[02:22:30]  Fuck him, baby!  Fuck him, you queer!  Hey, Father, bless the table!  You're a fucking mother!  Live in it, boy!  Live in it!  I love that movie.  That's a great movie.  You're at Robinson!  Yeah.  It's great.  Is that out on DVD?  Oh, yeah, of course it is.  I don't have that one for some reason.  It's a work of art.  Yes, it is.  Still waiting to get my king of comedy back.  I've got to go get my own version. 
[02:23:00]  Another...  I gave it to you!  My Best of Jerry album!  Ma!  I'm doing...  You should only get cancer.  You should get cancer!  I hope you get cancer.  Susan Sarandon and Playboy.  Maybe promise not to get you excited before a fight.  Smell of the gym. 
[02:23:30]  Anyway, Sarandon says that even if she decided to pose with her children, would definitely  have a word or two to say about it.  I can't do it now because my kids would kill me.  Now she has an excuse why she can't do it.  So she's waiting down the road?  No.  She's basically saying she's not going to do it.  She's not going to do it?  And the reason is because the kids would kill her.  I think the reason is no offer.  Yeah.  And the reason no one would buy...  Yeah, no one would buy the issue.  You know who else would kill her?  The masturbating public.  Imagine you're ready to scrap and you turn on that golf ball. 
[02:24:00]  Probably an ugly bag of meat.  Playboy's really not a good spank magazine, though.  No.  It really isn't.  If you're looking for sheer spank value, you need something filthier.  I don't like the idea, first of all, that I've got to flip through 18,000 advertisements  and interviews.  And for some reason, when you flip through Playboy, when you grab it and flip with your  thumb, it never lands on a nude picture.  Oh, they figured that out.  They did.  You've got to really look.  They figured that out with the inserts.  Those inserts are put in perfectly where you can't get to the pictures easily enough. 
[02:24:30]  It's like a ticket tape parade falling out of the bottom of the magazine when you're  trying to thumb through.  They don't even have as many naked women in there anymore.  I know.  And you're right.  You do need a little skank with your...  You need some skank.  I remember...  With your smut magazine.  The magazines that were great for it were Wee was good.  Remember Wee and Swank?  Swank.  Swank was good.  Great magazines.  Just filthy.  And loaded with nudity.  Not even just the women that are posing in the magazine, but the advertisements.  At the beginning, they had the letter section and there were nude women in that. 
[02:25:00]  Great.  You need the skank factor when you're scrapping.  Penthouse.  Penthouse is just about there.  Hardcore.  Penthouse is still...  Too much cock?  Think about it these days.  He is right.  They have some golden showers.  I mean, just considering it's one of the top magazines...  Penthouse loves the cock.  There's too much.  It's too much.  You're flipping through it.  You might get like, hey, this is going good.  And then all of a sudden, it's, you know, some guy with a baby's arm clutching an apple 
[02:25:30]  between his legs.  Swinging that bat.  I don't want to see that.  I don't want to see it.  I want to see the completely nude woman.  You suck this cock.  Suck this cock.  He's bigger than yours.  What are you kidding?  Just a fat pig selfish fool.  Fat pig selfish fool.  Another way Jake slaps her in the face.  He holds it.  He has his tongue in his teeth.  And he's lining up her face like he has to... 
[02:26:00]  He's so angry.  He's lining up that Polak face.  They get a great slap across her.  What an excellent scene that is.  We've got to get a cam in here because people have got to see the faces you're making.  Fat pig selfish fool.  Let's clean up a couple phone calls here.  Anthony on Long Island.  What's up?  Hey, how's it going?  Hello.  I was going to say, recently Alex Cooper was in the news saying that he was very pissed 
[02:26:30]  off at Bruce Springsteen and all those guys because when he was a kid, he listened  to rock and roll music because he didn't want to hear politics.  Yeah, right.  And now we've got all these celebrities going out like this.  It's crazy.  Now they're all activists and they're all telling you...  Now they're having a big concert to get the vote out for the youth of...  You know something?  And young people that are just voting age, they probably shouldn't vote.  I don't think their issues are very important when it comes to picking a leader. 
[02:27:00]  Eh, you hang out, you drink, you smoke some weed, you go to school, you got...  There's really...  Bills and things like buying houses and paying taxes.  Not really...  Not really something you got to do or you got to worry about.  So why...  I don't understand.  It's the Democrats' secret weapon, though.  Yeah.  They think they could, yeah, get Kerry in there with the young people's vote.  Yeah.  Although they kind of do have a good point because they're the ones going off getting shot.  So, eh, maybe you do have a point. 
[02:27:30]  I think people should vote.  But the problem with musicians and actors is that what's the matter?  You finally realize that your work has amounted to nothing.  You don't speak through your work, shut your mouth.  Either speak through what you're doing or shut up.  I mean, Springsteen, I'll give him credit.  I think he's revolting and boring.  But he does at least speak through his work.  Shut up.  But at least... 
[02:28:00]  Ugh, Jersey.  Wah, wah, wah.  I'm going back down to Jersey.  We're going to get more...  Shut up.  Everything's Jersey with him.  Ugh.  Ugh.  I picked up a Jersey whore last night.  She smelled just like the Elizabeth exit.  Oh, wah, wah.  Ugh.  Well, I drove my Chevy down to Jersey Shore.  I picked up me a Jersey whore. 
[02:28:30]  Ugh.  I went to Asbury Park and almost got shot by a colored...  All right.  All right.  Jeez, Bruce, come on.  I didn't think he was so racist.  Everything is about Jersey.  We get it.  You like Jersey.  I got a message for you in Jersey.  Wad, what's your message?  Jersey, the center of the universe.  Yeah, Jersey is such a great place.  We get it.  Why don't you sing it out? 
[02:29:00]  From the big oil tanks to the smelly air  to the Jersey girls with big pubic hair  I'm going back to Jersey.  Wah, wah.  Oh.  Oh, yeah.  We're all going to Jersey.  Please.  You don't like pink Cadillac?  Well, I went to Jersey  and I got nothing else to say about Jersey 
[02:29:30]  because it stinks.  Because Jersey wants to be New York.  Wah, wah, wah.  Jersey wants to be New York.  Yes, it does.  Well, we all know the Statue of Liberty belongs to Jersey.  Even though it faces New York  and its fat statue ass faces Jersey.  But we call it our own. 
[02:30:00]  Wah, wah, wah.  Oh.  Shut up.  Bruce.  Sing about another state.  The only guy that loves Jersey.  Bruce.  Tattoo ass faces Jersey.  Oh, that's funny, man.  Even Bon Jovi doesn't acknowledge Jersey  as much as me.  Wah, wah, wah.  Wah, wah, wah, wah. 
[02:30:30]  Well, I went to the beaches  at Asbury Park.  Used to be white, now it looks pretty dark.  Wah, wah, wah.  Wah, wah, wah.  But it's Jersey,  so it's okay.  Okay.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  Shut up, Bruce. 
[02:31:00]  Oh.  All right.  Yeah.  That's funny.  Is the wiffle ball bat girl ready?  Wow, we.  Yeah, we'll get her in,  but we also got Tom.  Tom's ready to go.  Tom's going to check in with us.  Oh, dang.  Do we talk to a drunk or a hot chick?  I really don't know what to do next.  Yeah.  Yeah, tough decisions are made every day here.  Should we look at her topless  or say hello to old brick liver?  I want to tie a note to his liver  and throw it through someone's lingo. 
[02:31:30]  Get out of the neighborhood, golfer.  Oh.  Oh.  All right.  As we step aside,  where are they from?  Jersey.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Yeah, they are from Jersey.  I like the wiffle bad chicks from Jersey  because they don't need the lube.  I don't know if this guy's complaining 
[02:32:00]  or happy.  South Carolina checking in.  Tracy, what's up?  Hey, I've never heard of you guys.  I saw you on Fox a couple weeks back  and decided I'd go ahead  and spend two bucks.  It was well worth it.  Hey, well worth two bucks a month.  Yeah, that shit was Bruce Springsteen.  Hilarious.  Funny, funny stuff.  Oh, all right.  I wasn't sure if you were liking us  or hating us.  I was confused, so.  Oh, yeah, liking it.  Liking it a lot.  All right, thanks, Tracy. 
[02:32:30]  You're welcome.  All right.  Yeah, we'll step aside, Anthony.  All right.  Another bit that we couldn't play  on regular radio anymore.  Yes.  And I know Infinity Broadcasting  is paying attention  because they have our archives,  so we're not allowed to play  anything that we did  at the old joint.  Mm-hmm.  But I'm finding stuff  that we're allowed to play  that we did way before  we worked for Infinity, okay?  Right.  Remember the caulk bit?  Ah, yes, Boston.  We weren't allowed to play this.  Right.  Basically, for the rest 
[02:33:00]  of the country in Boston,  you know, you say the word caulk,  it sounds like you're saying caulk.  Caulk.  Caulk.  That's right.  So we had an old lady, you know,  call, I think,  like a Home Depot or something.  Yeah, it was like a home center.  Looking for caulk, C-A-U-L-K.  Hello, miss.  I'm an elderly woman.  I just moved here  from Boston, Massachusetts.  And I have a leaky bath tub.  Uh-huh.  I believe I need caulk  to fill in the hole. 
[02:33:30]  Do you need pardon me?  I need caulk.  Okay, please hold.  Thank you for holding.  We will be with you shortly.  Hello?  Yes, I'm in desperate need of caulk.  The old caulk  just ain't working anymore.  Okay.  Over in the paint department,  they have GE silicone  they got for that.  Is that good caulk?  Sure is.  And that works good in a bath tub?  Sure does.  Could I speak to someone  in the paint department?  Sure.  Hold on one second.  You can call back caulk.  Hello, miss.  I need caulk.  You need caulk? 
[02:34:00]  No, I need caulk.  If I needed caulk,  I would have said caulk.  Clark.  Does he supply the caulk?  Can you spell this for me?  C-A-U-L-K.  Caulk.  Please hold.  Hello?  Paint department.  Hi, I need caulk.  Huh?  I need caulk.  Clark?  Caulk.  Yeah?  I need caulk  because I own a house now  and all the caulk in my house  is all dried up.  Okay.  I need some brand new caulk. 
[02:34:30]  You carry caulk?  You need caulk?  Yes, I need caulk for my bath tub.  Um, what kind?  Just, uh,  what kind of color  are you looking for?  I don't really care.  I like white caulk,  but, uh,  I'll take any color.  The caulk that's in my house  is all dried and cracked.  Oh, is it?  And it's leaky caulk.  I need new caulk.  All right.  Well, we got all sorts of  shapes and varieties here  of caulk for you, you know.  All kinds of shapes of caulk?  Oh, yeah.  We even have one 
[02:35:00]  that's about two feet long.  Really, darling?  A tube, yeah.  Well, that's a lot of caulk.  Yeah.  I probably could use that much.  Yeah, a lot of people could.  Thank you, sir.  You've been very kind.  Also, we have some, uh,  some special guns  to attach to the caulk, you know.  Get a little more width there.  Caulk?  Gun?  Yep.  Oh, that sounds very exciting.  I'll have to come down.  All right, we got plenty for you.  Thank you very much.  And if you don't see anything  on the shelf you like,  some of our employees  have their own  that they give to you.  Their own special brand of caulk?  Oh, yeah.  That's wonderful, darling. 
[02:35:30]  We do everything for you here.  Thank you very much, son.  We even, uh,  send someone over to your house  sometimes to help you use it.  To help me install the caulk?  Yep.  They'll install it for you real nice.  Somebody could help me  put the caulk in, really.  That's right.  That's wonderful.  All right.  So you have a good day, man.  Thank you, son.  Bye.  Bye.  Shut your mouth.  I said shut your fucking mouth.  I masturbated so hard, 
[02:36:00]  I almost broke my vagina.  Fuck.  The Opium Academy Show.  Yeah.  Not time for me  to get a little drink of water.  Figure this stuff  is safe to drink?  Huh?  Actually, I don't care  if it's safe or not.  I drink it anyway.  You know why?  Because I'm an American  and I expect a little cancer  in my food and water.  That's right.  I'm a loyal American 
[02:36:30]  and I'm not happy  unless I've let government  and industry poison me  a little bit every day.  Let me have a few  hundred thousand carcinogens here.  Ah.  A little cancer  never hurt anybody?  Everybody needs  a little cancer, I think.  It's good for you.  Keeps you on your toes.  Besides,  I ain't afraid of cancer.  I had broccoli  for lunch.  Broccoli kills cancer. 
[02:37:00]  A lot of people  don't know that.  It's not out yet.  It's true.  You find out  you got some cancer,  get yourself  a fucking bowl  of broccoli.  That'll wipe it  right out in a day or two.  Cauliflower, too.  Cauliflower kills  the really big cancers.  The ones you can see  through clothing  from across the street.  Broccoli kills  the little ones.  The ones that are  slowly eating you  away from inside.  While your goddamn  goofy,  half-educated doctor 
[02:37:30]  keeps telling you,  you're doing fine, Jim.  In fact,  bring your doctor  a bowl of broccoli.  He's probably got cancer, too.  Probably picked it up  from you.  They don't know  what they're doing.  It's all guesswork  and a white coat.  Here,  let me have a few more  sips of industrial waste.  Ah,  maybe,  maybe I can turn  them cancers  against one another.  That's what you gotta  hope for, you know,  that you get more  than one cancer  so they eat each other 
[02:38:00]  up instead of you.  In fact,  the way I look at it,  the more cancer you got,  the healthier you are.  history today.  October 9th,  1953.  Topper.  The premiere of the TV show,  Topper.  Starring as Marion Kirby,  the loveliest ghost in town,  and Jeffries.  October 9th,  1982.

Shut the fuck up,  you goddamn fuckhole, 
[02:39:30]  you piece of shit.  We got the controversy.  Just follow me,  cause we need a little  controversy,  cause it feels so empty  without me.  This is the  Opie and Anthony show.  Better known as  the ONA virus. 
[02:40:00]  Cause quite frankly,  I hate the name Opie.  Love when people  call us ONA,  it's much cooler.  Yeah,  Opie's the stupidest  nickname ever.  And I fully acknowledge that.  And a big thank you  and a big hello  to everyone that turned  on their XM satellite radios  over the weekend.  Yes, welcome.  That's what's so cool  about this satellite radio.  The audience growing  every single day.  And if you like  what you're hearing,  you know,  you can help us  spread the virus  and tell your friends  about it, okay?  Right. 
[02:40:30]  So, you know,  between the breaks here,  they're really piss breaks  basically.  Or we would talk  for four straight hours.  It's easy to do this show.  This new show  is so much easier to do.  So, I ran to the bathroom  and did my business  then came back  and the Frank's Place guy,  he's quite frankly  starting to scare me.  Really?  It looks like he is  so upset  with what has  happened here  with us completely  taking over  the New York facility  that he's not 
[02:41:00]  getting any sleep anymore.  And he's got dark circles  under his eyes.  Remember the first time  we met him  about two months ago  when we were taking the tours?  Yeah.  You know,  we took the tour  at the other place,  took the tour here.  And he looked  quite normal  and all that  and he was a very nice guy  and we shook hands  and he was hoping  that we would sign  with XM Satellite Radio,  blah, blah, blah.  Well,  after all the abuse  last week  and the fact  that he has to come here  at 5.30 now  for whatever reason  we don't even know.  It's taking its toll.  It's taking its toll 
[02:41:30]  on the guy  and he looks like  the dude from  Full Metal Jacket now  with the dark circles  under his eyes.  Private Pyle?  Private Pyle,  thank you.  It looks like he hasn't  slept in days.  I'm starting to get  a little scared  of this guy.  It looks like  something might be  happening in his head now.  Why is there  an Oompa Loompa  singing New York,  New York?  Why aren't you  stopping his chocolate  making guts out?  What's your name,  Oompa Loompa?  Oompa Loompa 
[02:42:00]  Doomp-a-dee-doo  I've got another  puzzle for you  Oompa Loompa  Doomp-a-dee-dee  If you are wise  you'll listen to me  Oompa Loompa  you'd best square  your ass away  and start shitting me  Tiffany Comflick  or I will definitely  fuck you up.  He talks to his rifle.  Look at that.  Look at the action  on your old blue eyes.  I think Master Poe 
[02:42:30]  is going to have to  frisk the Oompa Loompa  every morning now  when he gets here  at 5.30 in the morning.  Check those little  white gloves.  5.30 gets here at 5.  Your days of finger-banging  old Frank Sinatra  through his pretty  pink panties  are over.  This is my studio.  There are many like it  but this one is mine.  My studio is my life. 
[02:43:00]  Yeah.  Oh that's right Private Pyle  don't make any  fucking effort  to get over the top  of that fucking obstacle.  If God wanted you  in that studio  he'd have miracleed  your ass into it.  What time is that Private Pyle?  5 o'clock sir!  What time is that Private Pyle?  10 o'clock sir  when the OPNC show  is over sir! 
[02:43:30]  I bet you're the  kind of guy  who'd turn off  a person's radio  and not even have  the goddamn  common courtesy  to give him  a reach your ass.  Pick up your  fucking comb over.  He took the radio.  He didn't even  turn it off.  It's gone.  He took it.  He disconnected.  He took it.  He hid it somewhere.  The deadliest weapon  in the world  is a DJ  and a Frank Sinatra album.  I hate 
[02:44:00]  an unlocked radio.  If it wasn't  for thick heads  like you  there wouldn't be  any Wonka Bores  in the world.  Wonka Bores.  Ah, fuck.  You almost had it.  Ah, fuck.  All right,  let's say hi  to Sean in Alabama.  What's up, fellas?  Hey, Sean.  This is the first time  I'm actually listening  to y'all besides  on MP3  with Frank Caliendo.  I got that at home.  Oh, cool.  Thank God you weren't  listening last week  when we were trying  to figure out this mess.  But, y'all,  Stern, fuck Stern. 
[02:44:30]  He's got nothing on y'all.  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Very cool to, quite  frankly, creepy.  Very creepy. 
[02:45:00]  Got a guy in upstate New York.  Fudzo!  Hey, Fudzo!  Fudzo?  Fudzo, you still there?  I'm here, guys.  All right, we almost hung up  on you, man.  What do you got today?  I got seven guns ready to go.  Oh, Anthony, last week on the show  we were encouraging all the rednecks,  maybe we shouldn't use the term  rednecks on our radio show,  to shoot off their guns.  We like to have...  What are they called?  Shoot outs.  Shoot outs, right.  Instead of a shout out,  we do a shoot out.  Shoot out.  Yeah.  All right, so what kind of guns 
[02:45:30]  you got?  Well, I started out with a 17-caliber  Smith & Wesson out of the...  7.62 millimeter.  Then we go into a 22 caliber,  then I got a .357,  a 9 millimeter,  a .44 Black Hawk Magnum,  a .45 Kimber Royal Custom.  Wow.  Then we go to the big boy,  a .50 caliber Action Express,  Israeli Desert Eagle.  Oh, that Desert Eagle's nice.  You know, this did it.  There's too many guns in this country. 
[02:46:00]  Outstanding.  I don't think a guy should...  I don't think a guy should have seven guns.  You programmed all those songs.  We finally found something.  You do well.  I didn't bring them all with me,  just one of each caliber,  but I got many others.  All right, so what we're starting with?  Well, I figured I'd start with the small one  at the 17.  All right, let's go, Fudzo.  All right, should I get back on after each one  or just go through the rounds?  Get back on, I guess, after the first one.  Yeah, really quickly. 
[02:46:30]  Yeah, I just got to put the phone down  and put my headphones on.  One sec.  All right, here we go.  Fudzo from upstate New York.  This is the sound that's going to come out  of that office soon.  In the bathroom?  Yeah.  17 caliber.  Nice.  Nice.  Nice.  A shootout.  That's a six-round.  All right, what else you got?  Next one will be a .22.  .22.  Oh, that's a little guy.  It was a very good year. 
[02:47:00]  Little guy.  Go ahead, Fudzo.  Yeah, that's little.  Ah, that's boring.  Were you born an Oompa Loompa  or do you have to work at it?  Fudzo, why don't you go to the showstopper?  It was a .22.  Nice.  What are you shooting at, by the way?  He can't hear us, right?  What are you shooting at?  That was a .22.  I'm just shooting at a backdrop.  Okay.  It's between when the Metro and North trains go by.  Shooting at a golfer. 
[02:47:30]  Wait, are you in that book?  It's the past story, sir.  Next one's a .357.  All right.  Ready?  Yeah.  All right.  Oh, God.  Oh, I like that.  That's power.  I like that.  A lot of power there.  Nice one.  All right.  All right.  Now we're going to go to a 9mm.  There should be 18 or 20 rounds in this clip. 
[02:48:00]  All right.  There we go.  Nice.  Because that's how many you need to shoot a deer down.  Yeah, that'll take a chance.  That'll gag.  All right, Fudzo.  What else?  Next one's a Ruger Super Red Hawk, a .44 Magnum.  Nice.  All right.  Here we go.  Here we go.  This guy's got the goods, man. 
[02:48:30]  Here comes the Metro North train.  Yeah?  Well, don't shoot at that.  Yeah, don't shoot.  No, I wait for it to go by.  He's shooting where there's trains.  It's funny.  Jesus.  Okay.  It's funny.  He's wearing a board of the Long Island Railroad.  Next one's the Royal Kimber .45 Custom.  Okay. 
[02:49:00]  All right.  Yep.  That was it?  Did we lose him?  Did he shoot the phone?  Did he shoot his head?  That's good.  Nice.  Hey, why do you have all these guns, Fudzo?  I collect them.  I like shooting.  I don't kill things.  I just like shooting paper.  Well, you don't know if you're killing things.  I should just shoot them off into the wilderness.  And you got the showstopper now?  Yep.  The .50 caliber Action Express Desert Israeli Eagle. 
[02:49:30]  All right.  As long as my arm is up to it, I'll try to pump out all six or eight rounds, whatever  this thing is, whatever's in it.  Okay.  Here we go.  Oh.  That's a nice one.  Wow.  That's just scary.  Hell, I like you.  You can come over to my house and take my radio. 
[02:50:00]  That one will take down more things.  Wow.  All right.  Thanks, Fudzo.  You're very welcome.  Hang in there.  Hope you can use them.  Yeah, we just put that on the air.  Thanks, Fudz.  Very good.  Can I call you Fudz?  We've got to say hi to Tom from New Orleans.  We've got to explain Tom from New Orleans to the new listeners, especially the truck drivers  out there.  When we were syndicated, we were syndicated down to a station in New Orleans.  Yeah.  And they invited us down for Mardi Gras, which was a huge mistake.  And Tom was the ambassador for our weekend. 
[02:50:30]  He showed up at the airport with a cooler beer, which was fine.  Mm-hmm.  And then threw us in a limo and then started blowing pot smoke in our faces.  And then we broadcasted right there on a balcony overlooking Bourbon Street.  And I don't know.  His boss started or tried to lick Jim Norton's head.  I shoved him.  Yeah, it was awful.  It was absolutely awful.  And we've got to say hi to Tom.  It's been a while.  Hey, Tom.  What's up, buddy?  I've been on hold for long.  I feel like a stern. 
[02:51:00]  Call to you and start saying,  How it's stern?  Bubba Booey.  Robin Quillard's Bubba Booey.  What the fuck?  Well, we thought the guns were more important than you, Tom.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I hear you.  I hear you.  I had no idea what all the stern shit that was going on with you, boys.  It seems like, uh, it's, uh, Imus and Stern redone again, huh?  How you been, huh?  How you got it doing?  There it is.  How you got it doing?  What do you do now?  I know you're probably still drinking. 
[02:51:30]  I'm drinking Hawaiian punch right now, brother.  You caught me a little early.  With a little bit of vodka in there.  No vodka.  Are you still married?  Yes.  Remember now Tom had a picture of his wife up on his website from the bathroom?  It was a picture that he took, and you could see the reflection of Tom and the flash going  off in the mirror in the bathroom.  And it was his wife, like, dressed in some, uh, negligee.  She's sexy.  His wife's really sexy.  Yeah.  Really hot.  You still married to her?  Yep.  Wow.  She must be, uh, unconscious. 
[02:52:00]  So you got yourself another job?  Uh, yeah.  I'm in radio sales, uh, Intercom.  I'm selling about, like, four or five stations.  Intercom.  They're the company that really loves satellite radio.  Oh, they hate the satellite radio.  I got a satellite radio on my car, too.  Those idiots, uh, play the anti-satellite radio ads.  Yeah.  Non-stop.  Non-stop.  What could possibly be anti-satellite?  How could you book, what ad could you play?  You know, more commercials, less fun.  Commercial radio. 
[02:52:30]  That's true.  Tom, this isn't a good, uh, first appearance.  Why?  I don't know.  I'm not drunk yet.  You gotta be drunk.  I think you gotta call us when you get drunk, yeah.  When you want me to call, I'll get drunk.  I'll take a day off and just start pounding beers at six in the morning.  There he is.  You have me consorting with a cast of characters.  Hey, Tom.  You're an attractive man, Mr. Garrison.  When was the last time we talked to you, like, two years ago?  Uh, about that.  Did you lose any teeth since then? 
[02:53:00]  No.  Got all my teeth.  All my tooth is in.  All my tooth is in.  So, dude, Stone's really that much of a dick to y'all?  Oh, my God.  We've, uh, told a lot of the stories in the first week.  Yeah.  He had the gag order on us, and, uh, he wouldn't allow us to talk about, um...  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh, my God!  Oh, my God!  Oh, my God!  I used to think he was great.  Now, after hearing all that shit, I think he's a dick now.  Well...  Yeah, it's kind of the same way I am.  We have just touched the surface. 
[02:53:30]  So...  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He was a real prick to us.  I don't know why.  That blows, man.  Is Norton still, uh, being a loser?  I'm right here, Tom, and I'm happy to hear from you.  He's a winner.  I love you, Norton.  I know you do.  I'm the one that licked your head, Norton.  Why don't they get the story right?  Uh, you...  Yeah, you did actually lick my head.  There's still a spot there where hair won't grow.  Yeah, I forget what that awful...  Who was the guy that used to own the station?  And he never owned it. 
[02:54:00]  He was the GM.  His name was Kim Jones.  Whatever that...  Yeah.  What's he doing now?  He resurfaced in, like, market 420, if that's possible.  But he's down here, Alexandria, Louisiana.  Tom licked Jim's head, and Jim got alcohol poisoning through osmosis.  Boy, Tom, you really need to drink.  Yeah.  We don't like sober Tom.  We like drunk Tom.  Yeah.  My bad.  My bad.  That AA is a bitch.  Are you sober now?  Do you not drink anymore? 
[02:54:30]  I don't drink any less.  Oh, okay.  And I shouldn't say AA is a bitch.  At 7.52 in the morning.  At least you boys don't have to beat me out now when I drop the F-bomb by mistake, huh?  Yeah.  That's right.  All right, Tom.  Very, very...  What about the guy that does foundry music?  Hey, Steve!  He's around.  He doesn't want to talk to you, though.  What?  What do you got on him?  Oh, nothing.  I was just going to hang up with him on that little bit.  Oh, this call...  Oh, this call was very, very disappointing.  Yeah.  Good thing we went to the guns first.  Hey, boys, I will take a day off. 
[02:55:00]  I will start just pounding beers at, like, 5 a.m.  All right, you do that.  You've got to make up for this awful first phone call.  Yeah, there was a funnier call going to the Reeves household from the hospital last night.  Oh, my God.  Oh, jeez.  Man, that's awful.  Wow.  All right.  All right, Tom.  All right.  Thanks for the call, man.  All right.  Bye.  There goes Tom.  I want that head so sanitary and squared away that Hugh Panero himself would be proud to go in there and take a dump. 
[02:55:30]  Wow.  Sorry about that.  Yeah, sorry, man.  That's, you know, it happens.  You think you remember the things the way they were, and you try to revisit it, and that happens.  Tom was an entertaining, drunk guy who wouldn't shut up, had a lot of nonsense to say.  And now here he is.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  That was bad.  Speaking of Hugh Panero, the CEO of XM.  Swing and a miss.  He sent us a gift basket with a little note. 
[02:56:00]  Congratulations on the launch of your new show on XM.  All I can say is wow.  Although congratulations was spelled really weird.  How do you spell it?  C-O-N-G-R.  So far, so good.  A-U-T-L-A-I-O-N-S.  Congratulations?  But look at this basket.  I've never seen a huger basket in my life.  Wow, that's, what is in there?  Pretzels.  All sorts of fun stuff. 
[02:56:30]  Ooh.  Cheese.  Snacks.  All right, break that open, that's all salsa.  See, there's a couple of XM radios in there.  That'd be nice in the basket.  Okay.  Wiffleball Batgirls next.  We, you know, wow.  We were doing so great, and now we've got to get the show back on track here, okay?  Thanks, Tom.  That was great.  Another thing that I found, Anthony, we couldn't play on commercial radio.  Why is this Oompa Loompa out of his bunk?  Out of his cubicle.  Why is he out of his cubicle?  Why is this Oompa Loompa holding Ben's radio? 
[02:57:00]  Why are you not stomping Oompa Loompa's guts out?  Our jelly donut is chowled out of the cubicle.  Oompa, oompa, oompa-dee-doo.  I've got another puzzle for you.  Because I'm too heavy, sir.  Because you are a disgusting Oompa Loompa body, Profit Pile.  If you are wise, you'll listen to me.  Okay.  The F lesson, Anthony.  Yes. 
[02:57:30]  We were never able to play this uncensored before.  Now you can learn how handy this simple word is.  Perhaps one of the most interesting words in the English language today is the word fuck.  Out of all of the English words that begin with the letter F,  fuck is the only word that is referred to as the F word.  It's the one magical word.  Just by its sound can describe pain, pleasure, hate, and love. 
[02:58:00]  Fuck, as most words in the English language, is derived from German.  The word fricken, which means to strike.  In English, fuck falls into many grammatical categories.  As a transitive verb, for instance.  John fucked Shirley.  As an intransitive verb.  Shirley fucks.  Its meaning is not always sexual.  It can be used as an adjective, such as,  John's doing all the fucking work. 
[02:58:30]  As part of an adverb, Shirley talks too fucking much.  As an adverb, enhancing an adjective, Shirley is fucking beautiful.  As a noun, I don't give a fuck.  As part of a word, abso-fucking-lutely.  Or, in-fucking-credible.  And, as almost every word in a sentence,  Fuck the fucking fuckers.  As you must realize, there aren't too many words with the versatility of fuck. 
[02:59:00]  As in these examples describing situations such as,  Fraud.  I got fucked at the used car lot.  Dismay.  Aw, fuck it.  Trouble.  I guess I'm really fucked now.  Aggression.  Don't fuck with me, buddy.  Difficulty.  I don't understand this fucking question.  Inquiry.  Who the fuck was that?  Dissatisfaction.  I don't like what the fuck is going on here.  Incompetence.  He's a fuck-off. 
[02:59:30]  Dismissal.  Why don't you go outside and play hide and go fuck yourself?  I'm sure you can think of many more examples.  With all of these multi-purpose applications,  how can anyone be offended when you use the word?  We say, use this unique, flexible word more often than your daily speech.  It will identify the quality of your character immediately.  Say it loudly and proudly.  Fuck you. 
[03:00:00]  It's date night.  Get your shovel.  I never really find a good sound effect of a guy getting hit in the head with a shovel.  The OVM Show.  14 is the most sexual age I can ever remember.  At that time, 14, I totally couldn't do a thing.  I thought about sex, dreamt, schemed, plan, got nothing.  Got nothing.  You know, like it was grope and be clumsy. 
[03:00:30]  There are certain times in your life, like dancing close to Johnny Mathis.  I can remember that.  Not to Johnny himself.  One looks at me suddenly.  No, I'm talking to his record.  And groping around, you know.  Chances are my composure to the V.  The moment I come to you.  And the poor girl, Bob, do you respect me?  Yes, I respect you.  I just want to touch your dents. 
[03:01:00]  I'm sorry.  And I'd walk home with a limp, of course.  Hello.  The blue Monongahelas, perhaps, you could.  You know, with a mother who didn't understand at the other end.  What happened?  Nothing.  I hurt my leg.  Let me know.  Oh, humiliating.  I remember I found contraceptives in my father's drawer when I was eight years old.  And didn't know what the hell they were. 
[03:01:30]  And like everyone else who found them, proceeded to blow them up.  And, you know, with a modicum of intelligence, in ten minutes, you realize you have a very poorly made balloon here.  And, you know, I found them under a pair of Argyle socks.  The old man never wore next to a Japanese scarf with 101 sexual positions on it.  And a deck of cards that I went steady with for about two years. 
[03:02:00]  I remember waiting outside a drugstore, planning to buy contraceptives.  You know, I used to have to work up my courage.  What a dummy I was.  That was stupid.  You know, I used to go in and finally pad my order.  Can I have four bathing caps?  A tube of toothpaste, a comb, and a pack of...  You got it.  Oh, no, it's my brother.  He gave me a note.  I don't know.  No, my arm's there 20 feet long, actually.  Felt so awkward and so stupid.  But I would have paid a guy to buy them for me, really. 
[03:02:30]  Somebody could have made a fortune.  A kind of contraceptive purchasing agent to me.  Now, listen there.  Are you busy?  Would you do me a little favor?  Sure.  What are you, embarrassed?  He's embarrassed.  Give him a pack of Trojans.  Oh.  Uh, and can I have a toothbrush, too, with that, please?  And some pride, if you got it.  I'd like a little.  I remember once traveling with my parents in Maryland.  And we went into this gas station.  I went into the men's room, and there on the wall was a contraceptive machine. 
[03:03:00]  And I couldn't believe it.  You know, hey, you can beat the system.  I'm 16, man.  I can get away with it.  It's like the crime of the century.  I kind of thought, maybe, who knows?  Maybe the machine knows how old you are.  What do I know?  You'll put it in a quarter.  You're too young.  Whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop.  What happens?  The kid in the back trying to get contraceptive.  Whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop.  They flood the bathroom, you know.  Machine guns get on nests. 
[03:03:30]  Uh, but it didn't happen.  It was only in my imagination.  I put it in my quarter.  And out came the little round beauty.  And I took it, and I put it in my wallet.  Where it remained for four years.  It was a permanent round dent on my buttock.  It was like a prestige thing on the dance floor or something.  Really, we were animals, you know, dancing.  So why, you flash your wallet, you know.  So why, do myself.  It's wonderful, wonderful. 
[03:04:00]  Hey, Billy!  Look at that!  Oh, I want.  Tell me, 4X.  In the groove.  Opie and Anthony.  Do some push-ups, fatty.  This is the best show ever.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Word up.  Everybody say.  When you hear the call, you've got to get it underway. 
[03:04:30]  Word up.  It's the code word.  No matter what you say it, you know that you'll be learned.  Corn, word up.  Word up.  Yo, G.  This is the O.N.A. Show.  Opie and Anthony.  Spread the virus, please.  Let me see your Oompa Loompa face. 
[03:05:00]  You got an Oompa Loompa face?  Ah!  That's an Oompa Loompa face.  Now let me see your Oompa Loompa face.  Ah!  Do your parents have any Oompa Loompas that lived?  If Sinatra albums allowed in the barracks, they're paying for it.  You play it.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  You will not like me.  I am short, but I have a call over.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. 
[03:05:30]  Well, we chased him out again.  Good.  Job accomplished.  Hey, let's get the wiffle ball back, girl, in here and see what's going on with this.  I'm hearing we might have problems with this today.  Oh, no.  J-Zell from Niagara Falls.  J-Zell.  Hello.  Hey, what's going on?  What's up, buddy?  What's up, man?  I got to stop saying what's up, buddy.  Note to self, stop saying what's up.  What's wrong with that?  It's friendly?  What's up, buddy? 
[03:06:00]  Stop saying what's up, buddy.  What's wrong with that?  It's friendly?  I've said it a hundred times today.  It's friendly?  Go ahead, J-Zell.  Hey, man, I just wanted to say welcome back.  You guys fucking rock.  And I just wanted to tell you guys that TNA with ONA in Buffalo?  Oh, yeah.  Legendary.  Yes, it certainly is.  Holy Jesus.  It really is legendary, and it helped our downfall.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  It's also in the Infinity Broadcasting Manual on how not to do a live appearance.  Yeah, how not to do a live appearance. 
[03:06:30]  Well, it's still being talked about around here, man, and I'm sure if there's one word to  sum it up, we'd have to say zucchini.  Yeah, I think nude strippers doing each other with a zucchini on an open public beach where  there's families on blankets, that should have been, I don't know, that should have been  a little red flag going up there.  It was supposed to be a cute get-together.  Cute.  With a few hundred of our listeners.  It turned out to be an all-out lesbian orgy.  Yes, it was.  Um, five to six thousand people showed up for the lesbian orgy. 
[03:07:00]  Yes.  Oh, yeah.  Lesbians equal ratings.  That's right, Howard.  She wanted to come in studio, by the way.  I talked to her recently online.  The zucchini girl.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  She's a stripper or an ex-stripper in Buffalo.  But we're always trying to take it to the next level.  What is she going to do next?  A squash?  A pumpkin?  It's been a couple years.  A pumpkin.  Nice.  A pumpkin.  All right.  Yeah, that volleyball game was supposed to be a nice naked game, and I've seen one serve  and then just massive make-outs.  You know, it wasn't even supposed to be a naked game. 
[03:07:30]  TNA with ONA was supposed to be a couple strip clubs getting together, playing some volleyball.  Bikini volleyball.  Bikini volleyball, which would have been, you know, definitely cool and stuff.  Within five minutes, the girls were so coked out of their minds that they all got naked  and started rolling around in the sand and just having lesbian sex in front of five to six thousand people.  Well, remember the anal monster from Buffalo, Ben is holding up the sun.  Who was the anal monster?  She was the black chick in one of our contests, remember?  Oh, right.  And she was known as the anal monster.  The anal monster.  We nicknamed her the anal monster. 
[03:08:00]  So, yeah, it's like folklore up there in Buffalo now, man.  Oh, yeah, man.  It's still going around.  It's still being talked about.  Even the security guards got in on the front.  I remember that one.  And it's kind of like whoever you talk to in Buffalo, they now all say they were there.  Oh, yeah.  Absolutely, man.  Even though it was five to six thousand people in front.  And then there was kids.  I mean, it was just a mess.  Mickey rats.  They tried to arrest us.  We found out after we got back to New York.  And then only two months later, we did that stupid Sex for Sam thing.  And that sealed our fate. 
[03:08:30]  Well, it was good times for sure.  Hey, nice to be back.  Thanks, Jay.  All right, fellas.  Good to have you back.  Oh, man.  Later.  We lost our...  I can't hang...  Oh, never mind.  We don't want to bitch about technology today.  Is your mouse working?  Hey, Jay, what's up?  Hey, how are you guys doing?  Pretty good.  Hey, I'm new to the channel for you guys.  I've never heard you before.  Okay.  I heard all weekend long about Howard Stern this and that he's going on to Sears and all 
[03:09:00]  this other stuff.  But how come he's getting so much publicity and everything about doing that and you guys  didn't get half the publicity he got?  Well, we're getting a lot of publicity, though, and that's fine with us.  He's a bigger name.  We all know that.  We're the better show.  We will prove that.  We're the true underdogs.  And we kind of got attached to all those stories, though.  So, you know, it kind of worked for us, too.  We'll be just fine in this position.  We love being the underdogs.  Well, I'll tell you what.  Since I'm new to y'all, y'all have been rocking. 
[03:09:30]  I like it.  I think it's pretty good.  You guys got a good show going, and good luck to you all the way.  Oh, thank you.  You keep me awake at night on your replays because I like listening to you.  Why you don't do the crystal meth anymore?  Nah, those days are gone.  Those days are really gone.  You enjoy listening to the show while a good buddy bobs his head in your lap?  Hey, hey, hey.  Watch the good buddy.  Watch the good buddy, crap.  You know what a good buddy is, don't you?  Yeah, we figured that out last week. 
[03:10:00]  Yeah, he's one guy who goes out, gives a blowjob, comes back, gives another.  No, no, no.  Sir, you messed it up.  It's a guy who goes out and gets two blowjaws and comes back and gives you one.  There it is.  That's not only a good buddy, it's a relative in certain states.  Give me those ribs.  Elbow, elbow.  Good-natured giggle.  Let's see how to...  You know what a pickle park is, don't you?  A pickle park.  Yes.  That's a place where all the fags cruise?  A rest area?  Yeah, it's a rest area where all the fags hang out. 
[03:10:30]  There you go.  We learned that last week from another trucker.  Yeah, we're learning the trucker lingo.  Educational programming.  Pickle Park Pete or something they call them, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Give us a new one.  We got those two already.  Yeah.  Well, what else can I give you?  You know about lot lizards, right?  What is that?  Lot lizards.  Lot lizard?  Swamp lizard.  Yeah.  Oh, what?  They're whores.  You know?  They work the truck stop.  We call them creeper leapers.  Yeah, they got to just be awful looking.  Yeah, sleeper leaper. 
[03:11:00]  Sleeper leaper?  Sleeper leaper.  Jumps from truck to truck.  I like that.  All right, Jay.  Thank you.  Anyway, you guys have a good one, and I'm enjoying the show.  Keep it going.  It's really good.  I'm glad to hear you guys on there, champ.  All right, cool.  Thank you.  There goes Jay.  Thanks, mister.  Let's go to San Francisco and say hi to Davis.  Yo, Davis.  Good morning, guys.  How are you folks doing?  Pretty good.  What's going on?  Mike, I just want to say, last week was the first week I heard the show, and I did some  research with you guys. 
[03:11:30]  I really do enjoy it, and I just want to wish you guys all the best.  Oh, that's all you wanted to say?  Thank you, sir.  Thank you.  All right.  Thanks, Davis.  Take care.  All right.  Sorry to hear about your wedding being an old.  Damn state.  Let's say hi to Kevin and Jackie in studio.  Oh, I was looking at the phone line going, where?  No, Jackie was going to do the wiffle ball bat on Friday, but we didn't want to ruin it  because we had that hot reporter in here doing that piece for CBS News.  Oh, yeah.  That would have been the last thing we needed.  And we didn't feel like having that on CBS News, so we kind of like hit her in a closet 
[03:12:00]  pretty much and said, you know, just disappear.  Come back Monday.  And she came back Monday, but now I'm hearing there may be problems.  Kevin?  Yeah, we are.  You can get a little closer to the mic there.  May or may not be bleeding right now.  That may not be.  May or may not?  That's the definite.  That's what I was told.  From the front or the back?  I think there would be a problem if it was from the back.  Are we talking Kobe Bryant abuse or? 
[03:12:30]  The Kobe bleeding, yeah.  There you go, leaving a trail on the carpet.  No, no.  So, wow.  Well, that kind of blows.  When did you get your little friend?  This morning.  Oh, my God.  We ruined it.  Now, let me tell you something, and I think I could speak for everybody in this room.  We don't care as far as if any of your reservations, any whatsoever, are that somebody might care.  No, I kind of care.  But it will be great after you're done.  The bat will look like a Warhol painting.  It's natural. 
[03:13:00]  Yeah, I don't think so, though.  No?  She's so hot, too.  Yeah.  Kevin, you into the crime scene sex, or what?  It doesn't matter to me.  I'm in.  Yeah.  You'll do the crime scene sex?  No, he's lying.  During that time of the month?  No, he's lying.  You have a little sex?  No, he's lying.  Your bed looks like...  No, usually I try and stay away from it.  That looks like an episode of CSI.  My brother loves the crime scene sex.  Loves it?  Loves it.  Which one?  Breaks out the yellow tape and put the yellow tape around the bed. 
[03:13:30]  He loves the crime scene sex.  Has Caruso push his cheeks?  God, I'm not into that.  I like a lot.  I mean, if you've got to drop an eight-inch log, here's my chest.  Don't need to get up and miss the show.  That's your line?  Well, yeah, I just kind of think that.  But I don't like period sex.  It's not my thing at all.  No?  No.  I wish I had it, but I don't have that fetish.  So what are we going to do?  We were going to break in the wiffle ball bat today.  Drag in the Opa.  Let's break him in a little bit.  Guy looks like Milton from Office Space.  Stabler.  My Stabler, that's mine.  I brought it from home. 
[03:14:00]  So, Jackie, what can we do today?  I'll show you my boobs.  You know, that is very nice.  Yeah, she's hot.  I'm trying to help out.  It's not my fault.  But if you would have just come up here and said, hey, can I show you my boobs?  We'd be like, holy, oh, of course, yeah, yeah.  But to come in thinking we're going to get wiffle ball bat and then get the wow, you know.  It's not my fault, though.  The whole show us your boobs is great on regular radio, but we've got to really raise the bar here.  I promise I'll come back.  You will?  Yeah.  They do look nice.  You've got to give me, like, seven days, though. 
[03:14:30]  Seven days?  Seven days from right now?  I need a seven-day period.  Is that it?  Ben, pencil her in for next Monday.  Yes.  Next Monday.  Pencil in her cycle.  Someone might beat you to the wiffle ball bat, though.  I think we might get another girl.  I don't think they'll be as hot as her, though.  She's so hot.  She's blonde.  Beautiful.  That would be a first on the O&A show, too.  The time of the month wiffle ball bat, that would be a great combination of everything that's wrong in life.  You wouldn't even have to mark it off.  It would mark itself.  Self-marking wiffle bat challenger. 
[03:15:00]  Kind of like what low tide does at the beach.  It leaves the seaweed up at a certain point on the dunes.  Leaves a few fiddler crabs and whatnot.  Sure.  Sonny, what's going on?  Hey, Ope.  Hey, we've got to try to figure out what to do with this girl.  Why don't we see how old she is?  Oh, yeah.  She hasn't done that.  If she's not going to do the wiffle bat thing, she's not going to show Opie her taint.  Yeah, all you've got to do is use the string.  Really? 
[03:15:30]  I could guess your age easily.  Pull the string!  Pull the string!  All right.  Thank you, Sonny.  I hated.  All right, buddy.  Despised.  I have no home.  Nobody gives two fucks for Oompa.  All right, so I guess she'll show us her boobs and...  Frank Sinatra guy couldn't smell my shit!  I guess she's got to just flash us and then we've got to move on.  Yeah.  But she's not willing to come back. 
[03:16:00]  I mean...  Yeah.  You can take some stuff from Hugh Pinero's gift basket.  There you go.  It's laid out here like a big buffet.  Yeah.  All nice.  Can't stop shoving cookies into my fat face.  I saw that.  Steve broke out the camera for this from FoundryMusic.com because we put all this stuff on the websites.  You sure he doesn't want to just film the bottle of alcohol that's here on the table?  Wow, that is so hot.  Some booze.  Put that to my lips and just forget. 
[03:16:30]  All right, well, it's all about forgetting.  Hey, did Bruce want to see this?  Where's Bruce?  He's gone?  Where is he?  All right, let's...  Hold on, let's see if we can bring Larry Sanders in here, see if he wants to see it.  Let's see Jackie's boobs.  All righty, here we go.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Can I...  Those, if I may...  Oh, wow.  Those are the perfect nipples.  Those are the kinds I was talking about.  Could you lift up from the bottom so we can get the natural... 
[03:17:00]  Yeah, so we can see it go...  Yeah, yeah.  There.  Wow.  Goodness.  Wow.  Bravo.  They need to be a little bigger.  No, they're perfect.  They don't need to be bigger.  They need to be a little bit bigger.  No, they don't.  They're beautiful.  No, no bigger.  I'm so sick of the girls.  All girls think their boobs need to be bigger.  That is not what the deal is at all.  They're like a double D.  No!  What are those C's?  Are those C's?  You got like little C's.  A large B.  Large B, it's fine.  I wouldn't even say C.  Big B, little C, it's fine.  Sure.  What about the guys in the control room?  Oh, yeah.  Could you show the guys in the control room? 
[03:17:30]  They work really hard right there.  Could you talk to the guy that's standing up who looks like Christopher Reeve right before  he got on a horse in 95?  Doesn't he have the Yankee hat on?  He really does.  All right.  Well, fantastic.  Very, very nice.  And we'll look forward to you coming back.  Those are the first boobs on the new show?  They really are.  First boobs in studio here.  Did I have sister flash last week?  No.  Oh, okay.  I wasn't sure.  My sister shan't be flashing.  I copped the feel on the way out, but...  So did I.  You're a big dude. 
[03:18:00]  What do you do, man?  He's a strapping-bucker boyfriend.  I wrestle for University of Virginia.  Wow.  Really?  Yeah.  That's like your job?  More or less.  Jesus.  Yeah, he looks like he could kick some ass.  I'm a student, too, but that doesn't...  He wants to show you his tattoo of New Jersey, since you're making fun of him.  Yeah.  I've got a Jersey tattoo on my huge arm.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  He has some big fucking forearms.  I know.  Yeah, you're an animal.  Damn.  Hey, can you take a can of spinach and crack the guy in the face with the beard on the way  out?  And go, uck, uck, uck, uck, and erase all that shit he's been programming? 
[03:18:30]  He does look like Brutus with a low T-cell count.  Uck, uck, uck, uck, uck, uck.  Uck, uck, uck, uck, uck.  I just told my raids, Gio.  Uck, uck, uck, uck, uck, uck, uck.  Well, blow me down.  Little oomska loomska.  Your wife is attempting to bring an outside party into this situation.  And oompa loompa.  The oompa loompa will have to be corrected. 
[03:19:00]  Corrected.  All right, let's hear it for Kevin and Jackie.  Lovely.  Very nice.  See you guys.  Lovely.  Thanks for coming in.  You can hang out.  You don't have to leave.  You guys are...  Yeah, you looked pretty comfy over there.  Might as well sit.  It's almost like watching a TV show, isn't it?  Yes.  They watch us do this show through the big window.  It's a new sitcom.  The blonde boy, Anthony, and the chinless fat-titted nothing on WB.  I can't stop making fun of that guy.  All right, well.  I know.  Wiffle ball bat challenge.  I'm going to cross it off. 
[03:19:30]  Just didn't happen today.  Damn, I thought we had it.  We had two.  Thought we had it.  We had two killer bits that just didn't work out today.  Tom from New Orleans was supposed to give us like 15 minutes of good radio.  That's right.  And this girl should have gave us at least an hour and a half.  Yeah.  She's a team player, though.  She'll come back.  She'll come back Monday.  Next Monday.  Now that's something to look forward to because we saw her.  We saw her beautiful breasts.  And now when she comes back, it's going to be like an old friend returning to get a  wiffle ball bat.  Stuck in their box.  Yeah.  Well, sure. 
[03:20:00]  I'll say.  Wait, now.  Will this be up on the thing at all?  On Foundry?  Internet?  Oh, yeah.  Of course it will.  OpianAnthony.com for all your O&A needs.  Or as George W. Bush says, the internets.  The internets.  Did you hear him during the debate?  I was too busy.  He said the internets.  Now that shows me that he has no clue what the internet is all about.  Thank God.  The information super freeway.  What?  What?  He has no clue. 
[03:20:30]  We blew it today.  We don't have the you want wood clip today.  Yeah.  Or whatever it was that he said.  He's a funny guy, though.  That's right.  Like, Kerry is such a cornball.  At least Bush, I mean, that's a funny line.  At least he delivers good lines.  Kerry, one time in his speech, is like, oh, heavens to Betsy, folks.  It's like, is that the guy you want repping this country?  That cornball?  You want to hear a big lie from the debate?  I do have audio of probably one of the biggest lies of the whole debate.  I've got Allison.  Allison. 
[03:21:00]  She's the best friend I could ever have.  Oh.  I thought that was from the debate.  Oops.  Damn.  Hmm.  All right.  My bad.  My bad.  My bad.  We had another suicide here in New York City.  It's getting very dangerous to walk the streets of New York City for a new reason.  These selfish people that decide to jump out the windows or from the roofs of their building.  Yeah, that's what happens when you have a lot of tall buildings. 
[03:21:30]  People feel compelled to throw themselves out of the windows.  You hate your miserable life, slit your wrists, and take a warm bath.  A warm bath.  No one else dies when you do this.  Then they take care of your family.  Yeah.  Sure.  It's like the Romans.  Hey, you're up here in the Sierra Mountains drinking.  What are you drinking?  Champagne.  Champagne cocktails.  Oh, our first negative call.  What?  Our first negative call, and we were just starting to feel really good about ourselves. 
[03:22:00]  Oh.  Gee.  Hi, Kenny.  Hey, what's going on, man?  What's up, Kenny?  Hey, are you going to get some kind of agenda here or make this kind of funny?  An agenda?  Yeah.  You know, kind of get some kind of skit going or...  Oh, we don't do skit going.  Kenny, we don't do that.  Like, what kind of skit?  What kind of skit are you looking for, sir?  Well, you know, something that's funny.  Where are you calling from?  California.  San Jose.  No, I'm... 
[03:22:30]  What show do you listen to where you like the skits?  Oh, well, no.  I'm a big fan of XM.  Okay.  I love Station 150.  I love the comedy.  The comedy town was nice.  So what's a show you listen to that has skits?  So we'll try to go get that type of a skit for the show to keep you happy.  Well, how about something that actually works out, not some chick with a whistleball bat that's on her period.  Oh, well...  What's funnier than that?  Well, that was a big disappointment, you're right.  Yes, we're very disappointed, and I'm sure our listeners are, too. 
[03:23:00]  But you know what's great about this show?  Another girl will step up sometime this week, and she'll take Jackie's place, and we'll get the whiffleball bat thing done.  Ken, you're a preacher to the choir.  What kind of a skit do you want to hear?  Don't say something funny.  Just give us something specific that we can work on.  We're listening to the new listeners.  Let's do something funny, something not...  It doesn't have to be comical.  It doesn't have to be comical?  I want to do a whole...  Comical.  We need some comedy here.  Like, what...  Tell me what you...  Kenny, boy, what do you need?  I want to do the buh-byes skit. 
[03:23:30]  I don't know.  Aren't you guys...  Why don't we all just...  What?  Aren't you supposed to be funny?  No, no.  But, Kenny, what I'm saying is this.  You sound like a rube who enjoys that mom-and-pop type of phony, horse-shit, dog-shit radio they have in California.  So, I'm saying...  And I'm sure that's the kind of humor you like.  The easy, down-the-middle stuff.  You know, a little wacky character.  Ding-dong!  Funny male guy.  We're asking you what you like.  Excuse me.  Excuse me there, asshole.  Oh!  Oh!  Oh, oh, oh!  They don't say that, you skit!  Wow!  What is this? 
[03:24:00]  Let me tell you.  Wow!  Wow!  Wow!  If you're criticizing the radio I listen to...  Well, hold on, hold on.  What's that?  Yes?  If you're criticizing the radio I listen to, it's your fucking employer.  Ooh, dirty language for such a skit-loving little boy.  What I'm saying is, person who I hope dies of cancer the day before a relative gets married,  what type of a skit would you like to hear?  And you're not being specific.  You're being passive-aggressive like every other faggot from that state that you live 
[03:24:30]  in.  So will you please be specific?  Get the cock out of your mouth and talk right.  Be specific.  Get the cock out of your mouth.  Oh, we got you there.  Oh, I got a cock in my mouth.  Well, it's your father.  Since your mother won't suck it, I decided to lean over and toot on it a little bit.  What's up with the wrist, huh?  What's that?  You're in San Francisco sucking cock, you fag.  Ooh, there we go.  That's the type of skit you like, isn't it?  Dirty two men talking about sucking cocks.  Now we got what you like.  Two men going back and forth.  So tell us what you want, Kenny.  You know what? 
[03:25:00]  There's good radio right there, man.  There's good radio.  Yes.  Let's argue.  Because you're involved.  What do you want?  You want these faggoty sketches.  We don't do sketches, stupid.  Except for our buh-bye skit.  We don't do skits.  No?  Why do we just have these truck drivers calling in?  You know, which I agree.  They're fine.  They're great callers.  But we all ain't all for them to fail.  Oh, I know.  You want a sketch with a funny southern voice. 
[03:25:30]  That's probably the type of comedy you like.  The type of thing where the funny voice is happening.  Or maybe the gay character comes in.  Hi, boy.  And you're like, oh, that's good.  The guy sounds gay.  I'm having a real hard time understanding you.  No, you're not, stupid.  Bad speech impairment, don't you?  Impairment?  What's an impairment, you fucking idiot?  I speak perfectly clearly.  And you understand everything I'm saying.  You sound like fucking a cross between Sylvester the Cat and Elmer Fultz.  Wow, that was really an obscure reference.  I see.  You like cartoon references. 
[03:26:00]  Listen, you got a horn just like...  Wait, hold on.  Hold on.  Let Kenny finish his obscure reference.  What was that?  Things quick on his feet?  Hold on.  You got to get a little bit more original than that, right?  Oh, you don't understand the irony of it?  You West Coast idiot.  There's nothing coming out of that fucking state but soft, weak garbage.  And that's what you like.  Commercial garbage.  I've asked you for a show that you listen to.  Let me finish, fucker.  I've asked you for something that you like and you haven't been able to provide it.  Name me one show you listen to. 
[03:26:30]  Name me one show.  That's what I'm listening to.  I've been an FM subscriber for over a year.  I don't give a shit.  Cancel the service, faggot.  Tell me something you listen to.  You're not going to blackmail me.  I'm an XM subscriber.  I don't get a piece of the action, motherfucker.  What do I care?  Oh shit, don't lose a customer.  I don't care if you throw your XM down the toilet, buy a serious and then fuck your mother.  I'm an XM subscriber, mister.  He's threatening you.  I pay my $9.95 a month. 
[03:27:00]  I pay my taxes.  You're a civil servant.  I pay your salary.  Oh my god.  You're trying to blackmail me with that horse shit?  Are you out of your mind, stupid?  Why don't you listen for a second?  Why don't you listen for a second?  If you answer my question, I will listen.  Yes, I am gay.  I want to tell you something.  The smartest thing to come out of his mouth was his boyfriend's cock.  Oh, oh, you paused us for that.  Now he got you.  He got you.  Did you actually just make us stop talking for that horse shit cornball hee-ho- 
[03:27:30]  Your head should pop out of a laughing box when you say that.  Nobody could fucking understand you.  Oh, you understand me pretty well.  Oh.  Tell me what you want to hear.  Tell me what you want to hear.  You're not answering the question.  How about something funny?  What show do you think is funny?  You got something funny.  What show?  Wait a minute, wait a minute.  No, I'm not going to wait a minute, you cop sucker.  What's to tell me to wait a minute, you faggoty West Coast caller?  You know what you fucking get paid to do?  Yes, I get paid a lot to do this. 
[03:28:00]  That's the beauty of it.  I don't know, and you're fucking ripping him off all the way to the bank.  Oh, I'm laughing all the way to the bank, am I?  You cliche-slinging bucket of jism.  I hope you killed a drunk driving accident on New Year's Eve.  We want to hear some sketches with Southern voices.  Get behind the wheel after drinking a few and plow into a pregnant lady.  How's that for a sketch, West Coast jerk-off?  I want to hear a sketch.  I'm an XM subscriber.  Who gives a shit? 
[03:28:30]  Hey, if you cancel the service, ship me your fucking roadie, too, because I can't get one from the company.  Do you believe?  I don't even mind him hating the show.  That's fine.  But the balls on this idiot to think that I get a piece of the action, and I'm somehow concerned he may cancel.  Uh-oh.  Walk on eggshells with this fella.  He's a subscriber for over a year.  That means you pumped in about $130 plus a unit. 
[03:29:00]  You get no say.  None.  Your opinion is worthless on this network.  And he will pay his $1.99 for November, I guarantee it.  Good.  I don't care if he doesn't.  He's not going anywhere.  He's not going anywhere.  Believe me, he's not going anywhere.  He's going to tell all his friends how he was the star of the show today.  Yeah, and I paused it.  Well, here's the part where I paused it.  Funniest thing to ever come out of your mouth was your boyfriend's cock.  Wah-wah-wah-wah-wah-wah.  I hope you're on a casino bus that flips over. 
[03:29:30]  That usually happens in Jersey, by the way.  Yeah, it really does.  My casino bus flipped over in Jersey.  Had he named one show, this is my problem.  If he would have named a show, like he thinks this show sucks, all right, fine, but just name  a show that you like, and he kept going, I listen to XM, like I'm going to go, uh-oh,  don't talk about XM because he listens to it.  Tell me a show you like.  That was a guy that just really had a complete lack of understanding of what this show and  everyone involved in this show is all about. 
[03:30:00]  Look where he lives, man.  The West Coast, that's what they go for.  They want soft little sketches, mom and pack.  You're obsessed with the West Coast.  I don't think it's a West Coast thing.  I know you don't, but everything that's ever stopped in my career has been because the  West Coast people didn't like it.  Everything that the East Coast likes, we just got to run it by the West Coast.  Well, that fucking idea.  I guess we should tell everyone, if you're looking for structure from the Opie and Anthony  show, you're never going to get it.  No, that's what he wants.  We're not getting structure.  We make up this crap on the fly every single day.  That's what annoyed me about, not this guy thinking your humor sucks.  That's fine. 
[03:30:30]  But when it's, I know what I want.  I like A, B, and C.  I like sitcom type of humor.  That's what makes me sick.  All right.  You know what?  That guy, Mike from Baltimore, has a point.  Oh, okay.  I think he knows what this guy.  Let's go to Mike.  Hey, Mike.  Guys, what's up?  I love the show.  Can I just say fuck because we're on the radio?  Yeah, sure.  Well, you know what?  There is a rule.  There's a lot of new listeners turning on their XM satellite radios.  We don't want to curse just a curse here.  Okay.  Although, Norton, that was a perfect example of how you should use your curses on this show. 
[03:31:00]  Well, then, can I say fuck Stern?  If you like, sure.  Why not?  Fuck Stern.  All right.  All right.  Listen, I think that guy's looking for a little something for the rigged egg do.  The grease man, Joe.  He's looking for little sketches.  Hey, Steve C., do you have the theme to swat?  Let's see how long it takes him to get this.  What are the doodling?  He's got to find it in the dilette.  Well, that's what the grease man did, though.  The grease man did sketches.  He used to take that joke book, that one-line jokes, and make a 20-minute story out of it. 
[03:31:30]  Yeah.  That was his whole bit.  That was his show.  So, Kenny, sit down and put on your laughing hat because I think a sketch is coming.  A sketch, yeah.  That's what it was.  That's what he's looking for, that type of structured bit.  Steve's panicking.  I don't think he's going to be able to find out.  Oh, Steve's freaking out.  The theme song in time.  I don't have it.  What, Steve?  I'm not freaking out.  They just don't have it in here yet.  Oh, they don't have it?  Okay.  All right.  Sorry about that.  Sorry. 
[03:32:00]  See?  Can't even make the guy happy from San Jose.  Kenny, you would have had a great sketch there.  Oh, man.  Look, hey, dude, I was only kidding.  Don't go canceling your XM subscription.  I don't need that on my conscience.  The company's really going to come down on me if I lost them a subscriber.  So, hey, all kidding aside, stay with the XM Nation.  Hey, Phil, what's up?  Steve must be looking for that clip on foundrymusic.com if he can't find it.  Much more easier to navigate.  Yes, much easier to navigate.  Substantially more easy to navigate.  All right.  Let's say hi to Rochester. 
[03:32:30]  What's up?  A little labyrinth.  Hey.  I just wanted to say that ass.  I'm sorry.  I don't want to swear just to swear.  That's right.  That SNA from California.  Yes.  How he said Norton talks like he has a dick in his mouth.  I mean, I get that shit all the time since I moved to the South.  Everyone's always on.  Dicks in the mouth?  I can't understand your damn ass.  Sound like you're talking with a dick in your mouth.  Because they're a very homoerotic culture.  So that's the analogy he'd make.  Why couldn't he say, hey, Jim, it sounds like you're talking with a three-inch clit in your mouth.  When I stated earlier that that's what I like. 
[03:33:00]  Yeah, I guess I'll get your New Yorker fags on, I suppose, right?  He just didn't get the show.  All right.  He's looking for something else, perhaps.  Okay, we're going to step aside, Anthony.  We've still got to talk about the latest person jumping from a building, putting us all in danger.  Oh, right, right.  Selfish.  This is a trend that has hit New York City.  We'll get into that next, okay?  And found something that we haven't played in a long time.  Ah, another bit that we couldn't play on radio anymore?  Well, this one was a little different.  When we made our Demented World CD in Boston, and it sold very, very well, 
[03:33:30]  there was a bit on there, a bit that we wanted to put on the CD, but it was too cruel and too mean.  Dave Dickless decided that it shouldn't be on the CD.  Yes, and we all know how much he knows.  We have a version of Hi, Mom, I'm in Jail on Demented World.  Yeah.  This is a Hi, Mom, I'm in Jail that went horribly wrong.  Oh, I do remember this one.  Yeah, yeah.  Made us feel bad for a second.  Back then, we were much wimpier, and we had to take it.  We really wanted this one on our CD, but we couldn't do it for some reason. 
[03:34:00]  But here it is now on the new Opie and Anthony show.  Hello, Mark.  Yo.  Are you ready to play Hi, Mom, I'm in Jail?  Sure.  All right, now, what are you going to tell your mom when she gets on the phone?  I'm going to tell her I was with a couple of prostitutes.  Wow, that could be pretty good.  That's a good one.  Yeah, I haven't been to jail in like about eight years, so.  So she thinks you've cleaned up your act, huh?  Yeah, and I'm happily married, you know?  Uh-oh.  Oh, and you're married, and you got called with the prostitutes?  Yeah.  Let's give your mom a call, man.  Okay, cool.  Make this good.  Here we go. 
[03:34:30]  Yeah?  Ma.  What?  Listen, it's Mark.  Yeah?  Listen, I'm in jail.  What?  Yeah.  Hey, hey.  I got caught on a couple of prostitutes.  Who's this?  Mark.  It's your son, Mark.  Where are you?  I'm in jail.  Downtown.  Don't tell Gina.  I need you to come bail me out.  Who?  You.  With what?  Oh, get away. 
[03:35:00]  I don't know.  You can't.  Don't call my house.  Oh, this call's being monitored, ma'am.  Okay.  The police department.  I didn't know if she was joking with me or if she's serious or what.  Ma, I'm serious.  Oh, jeez.  We've set the bail at $5,000, ma'am.  That will be cash.  $5,000?  Yes.  What did he do?  It was found with a couple of prostitutes, one of which was a transvestite.  And it's a serious charge, ma'am. 
[03:35:30]  Will someone be coming to pick him up?  Ma?  What?  Can you come?  We've got to clear this up before it makes the paper tomorrow morning.  Who am I speaking to?  This is Officer Jenkins.  Officer Jenkins.  I'll have to call his brother.  I'll call his brother and see if I can get the money.  We know also the prostitute has tested positive for the AIDS virus, which is another problem  he's going to have to deal with.  Hello, ma'am.  Yes, I'm here.  Oh.  Where's Sonny Boy?  Are you speaking up to your mother?  Yeah, ma'am.  What? 
[03:36:00]  Well, I don't know how to tell you how this happened.  I was with the brain.  You know the brain?  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  I picked him up with a couple of them.  It's not a laughing matter, son.  I know.  I know.  Mother sounds very upset.  You try to raise your kids.  You do your best.  I'm sure you did your best, didn't you, ma'am?  Yeah.  And look at what happens.  Oh, my God.  She's so upset.  I can't do this anymore.  Ma!  I can't do this.  Ma! 
[03:36:30]  Hey, ma!  Excuse me, ma'am.  Yeah?  Happy Mother's Day, ma!  It's a joke.  This was the worst.  Oh, I'm going to burn in hell for this, ma'am.  Oh, no.  Ma!  She's all right.  He's fine.  He's not in jail.  It's only...  Ma, you're live on the radio.  You could smack him in the head.  Ma, you still there?  Yeah.  Talk to us, ma'am.  Look how upset...  Oh, my God.  Dude! 
[03:37:00]  I got to make a phone call.  Did you know she was going to get that upset?  No!  Oh, my God.  Usually, I can joke with her, you know.  I'm always joking with her.  Oh, no.  I'm always joking with her.  Oh, we feel horrible now.  You got to smooth things over and call us back, man.  All right.  All right, bro.  Oh, no.  Good luck.  Good luck.  Good luck.  Bye.  Oh, no.  That one didn't work well.  Oh, my God.  Welcome to the O.P.  And Andrew. 
[03:37:30]  Oh, dinner.  Hey, man.  Here you go.  No, no, no.  That's cool.  Keep it.  Keep it.  Mmm.  Chicken.  You know, one of the other things that I do like about Ireland is the fact that there  are no health clubs there.  And I deeply appreciate that.  My generation should be punished severely for creating the health club. 
[03:38:00]  It's a horrible, horrible place.  I don't understand.  And I have lots of friends that go to them.  And it makes me want to hit them.  I don't understand them.  First off, I don't like the costume.  And nobody looks good in a Speedo.  Nobody.  No one ever has.  No one ever will.  I tried a Speedo on the other day, and I got it to my knees.  And I said, fuck, this is what a sausage feels like. 
[03:38:30]  People wandered around going, how do I look at my Speedo?  Well, it looks like you're carrying grapes in the wrong place.  Health clubs aren't healthy.  In New York City, which has the most stairs of anywhere in the country, people pay money  to go to a health club and use a Stairmaster.  When you live in a city that has nothing but stairs, and you pay money to use special stairs,  that is not healthy behavior. 
[03:39:00]  It's fucking psychotic!  I knew I was going to last at the health club when I found myself on the treadmill for the first time.  And I was running in place, and I'm thinking, fuck, I hate to run.  But it seems to me, if you're going to be running, when you're done, you should be somewhere else.  So I'm running in place, and then I realize there's a mirror in front of me, and I'm going,  well, what the fuck is that for? 
[03:39:30]  That's a really great idea, so I can watch myself do something I fucking don't like to do.  Now I can think about how much I hate what the fuck I'm doing.  Then I noticed that there are mirrors everywhere, every health club.  It's literally surrounded by mirrors.  Because apparently, many of our fellow Americans like to exercise, and watch themselves exercise.  Which is why I believe there should be a psychiatrist on duty at every health club. 
[03:40:00]  Because if you're actually spending a portion of your week watching your muscle grow,  your ego's reached a point where it's eating itself.  And so I believe that the psychiatrist should grab you, and take you away for a little chat.  So I'm running in place, and I'm looking at myself in the mirror, and I'm thinking,  I'm never going to get there.  And I believe the human brain is so smart, that when it watches you, watch yourself, watch you, watch yourself, 
[03:40:30]  do something you shouldn't be fucking doing, it says you are so stupid, I will kill you.  100 channels of crystal clear digital audio, XM satellite radio, radio to the power of X.  On the Opie and Anthony Show, we're going to make fun of people with Down Syndrome. 
[03:41:00]  I just didn't want to be in the middle of the flight and have him yank that handle,  hoping candy comes out and blow the door off the plane.  We all get sucked out except for him, because his head gets stuck.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Spread the O&A virus across America for us. 
[03:41:30]  On High Voltage 202, we'll be changing the name of this channel very soon, now that we're getting comfortable.  Oh yeah?  This is the Opie and Anthony Show, thanks for checking us out, greatly appreciate it.  I want to change it to Frank's Place.  I want to change it to O&A virus.  You like that one, virus?  The virus?  Our name has to be on the channel.  How about the Opie and Anthony channel? 
[03:42:00]  Opie and Anthony's virus.  Something Opie and Anthony would virus.  How about Opie and Anthony, semi-colon, we don't do bits, cock face.  Well, that Hi Mom in Jail was kind of a bit.  That's a great one, too.  It had a little skit.  There was a little skit to it.  A sketch.  There was a little sketch comedy to that.  All right.  Sketch comedy.  Really fast before we get out of here.  This day flew the F.  Bye, man.  It certainly did.  There's a trend happening here in New York City.  People are killing themselves, but they're doing it by jumping out of buildings. 
[03:42:30]  Keep it to yourself, people.  Which is putting us all in danger.  I'll say.  We got a story from a few years back that happened outside the Harley Davidson Cafe.  That guy.  We put all those pictures up on our website at the time, and a lot of people got pissed  off at us because the guy looked kind of like sidewalk pizza after he was done.  Giant sidewalk pizza.  But it was only like two blocks from where we broadcast, more or less, and this guy decides  he needed to kill himself, so he opens up his window and jumps out, okay? 
[03:43:00]  Jumped.  The problem is he horrified a lady for the rest of her life because he brushed right  by her shoulder before he hit the sidewalk, almost taking her out as well.  Selfish, selfish, selfish.  It was during lunchtime, too, so the sidewalks were crowded.  There are some people that are just plain selfish when they go to kill themselves.  There's jumpers, the people that throw themselves in front of trains, too.  First of all, not only do you traumatize the engineer, but now everyone's got to wait.  You know, you're on a train, you're trying to get into work or something, and some selfish 
[03:43:30]  bastard puts himself on the tracks.  It's a drag for everyone involved.  Certainly is.  All of a sudden you're late for work and the boss is yelling at you because you had  to jump in front of the train.  Yeah.  It's funny you say that.  That reminds me of my favorite song, Manic Monday.  Talks about being late for work.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's one of your favorite songs.  Oh, it's great.  It's got meaning.  It's got a nice little dance beat.  We could play a Monday block of songs for you.  I'd like that.  A Monday block, huh?  Yeah.  Throw in I Don't Like Mondays. 
[03:44:00]  Mm-hmm.  Because she likes Sunday.  That's her fun day.  Oh, he gets this one on.  Wow.  Two seconds.  I couldn't get SWAT.  There I was on Manic Monday.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, it doesn't quite work like the SWAT theme.  We've got to get the SWAT theme for tomorrow.  If you remind us, we'll do the Greaseman SWAT bit tomorrow,  I guess.  The Bangles.  What was the line in the song where she's trying to insinuate that her and her boyfriend had  sex?  Oh, they get under the sheets.  Come on, honey.  Let's make some noise.  Yeah.  Yeah.  How do you know the words to that song? 
[03:44:30]  Because I like the song, but it's the worst.  I like the Bangles.  I used to watch the videos all the time when they came on MTV because she was hot.  She was so hot.  Susanna Hops.  Ugh.  Would you ever scrap to them?  No.  You scrapped to...  MTV videos?  You know what?  If it had a good ass in it, like Pat Benatar videos and Joan Jett Crimson and Clover,  I used to whack my bag to because she had those leather pants on.  Oh, God.  Joan Jett.  Joan Jett.  She had great cheeks, though, and leather pants.  Too dykey looking.  Who can't?  I was 14.  I had no cable.  Am I supposed to whack fruit in my parents' house? 
[03:45:00]  What am I supposed to whack my bag to?  You look too much like Christy McNichols to whack your bag to.  I liked her.  Armand Asante.  I just...  Wow.  No, this one.  Good shoes.  Looks like Steve got some sleep over the weekend.  Nah.  He's sharp as a tack.  I'll say.  She had no sex appeal, man.  I disagree.  I didn't think so.  And the videos would go by too quickly.  Like, if there was a nice shot of one of the chicks, they would go by too quickly to  do anything, too.  I need repetition.  That's true.  I need to be able to look at something for a while as it's on a video, you know? 
[03:45:30]  Do you prefer pinky or a leather Tuscadero?  I was a leather Tuscadero more of a guy.  Sponsie had the worst taste in women.  I like the last show.  He liked these nasty old spent broads.  Bank twins.  You gotta respect that.  Eee.  Meanwhile, Joni's there, 14.  Old Arthur Fonzarelli should have taken full advantage of that than giving Mrs. C a good  sodomizing.  Joni, my office.  Have her come in the bathroom.  Look at Steve go now. 
[03:46:00]  Wow.  Steve is trying to show off his skills today.  A maestro.  It's Steve Norris in the other room.  Nice.  Martini Steve.  Martini Steve.  Rockin' and rollin'.  A maestro.  All right.  So there's a trend in New York City.  Yeah.  People are jumping out of buildings and putting our lives in danger.  That does seem to be.  Was that near NYU?  Well, it seems to be what's happening.  How many from NYU?  Three or four already?  They're all doing it in my neighborhood.  This is where I live that this is all going on in. 
[03:46:30]  It's just like, Jesus Christ, look out.  They ought to just surround NYU with trampolines.  Trick the little bastards.  They jump.  Boing.  You hear boing.  And then they end up back in their window.  What happened?  I don't want to live anymore.  Hi, how are you?  Back.  Things are better.  Hey.  They wave to the roommate from outside.  Hello.  Go back down.  That's wacky.  I bet the guy in San Jose's spanking one out to this comedy right now.  There it is.  Thanks, Steve. 
[03:47:00]  Boing.  You got to turn up your boing sound a little bit.  Wouldn't that be great?  Oh, I'm jumping.  I'm killing myself.  Oh.  Whoa.  What happened?  I should have been splattered on the road.  It's cartoon physics again, though.  Oh, they always bounce up as high as they jumped.  Cartoon physics.  Of course, you know, could never happen.  Aren't you supposed to bounce just a little less every time?  Yeah, there's some formula that goes along with how high you would bounce.  But in cartoons, boing, boing, to the same level.  How much of a spring there is.  Sure.  Over and over again.  The best thing about cartoons, when Fred Flintstone was running through his house. 
[03:47:30]  Yes.  It made it look like his house was 100 yards long.  Yeah, and it was the same couch and window going by.  Over and over again.  Or when he'd be eating that big pterodactyl leg, and he'd take a bite out of it, and then  he'd take another bite, but you only see that one bite.  Sure.  I loved the Flintstones.  I hated it.  I loved the Flintstones right up until they changed Fred's voice, and it screwed the whole  thing up.  As a kid, I never liked when they changed the cartoon character's voice.  It wasn't familiar anymore. 
[03:48:00]  And with the Flintstones, I used to love the show, and then all of a sudden, one day,  you turn it on, and there's Fred going, hey, Barney, come on, we'll be late for work.  You're like, what the?  That's not Fred.  That's not the Fred.  Okay, Fred.  You know, you got Barney in there, and it's like, get in the car, Barney.  What?  What?  Got to go to the Moose Lodge.  Who told Alan Reed to die?  Oh, is that what happened?  That's what happened?  Yeah, you know, back then, they were probably all smoking, drinking, doing the blow. 
[03:48:30]  Yeah.  Who knows?  I hated the Flintstones, and I hated the Jetsons.  I didn't like the Jetsons, but I liked the Flintstones.  You know, honeymooners rip off.  Yeah, of course.  All right, so.  I like Bugs Bunny.  Another person jumped out a window, Anthony.  Porn star's suicide.  A transsexual porn model.  Jesus.  Oh, this hurts already.  A tranny.  Who recently starred in a film about her troubled life, leaped to her death from the  20th floor window of her luxury apartment in Manhattan yesterday. 
[03:49:00]  Luxury.  Susan Shaw, 36, had been depressed over health problems that included her 10-year battle with  AIDS.  Susan or Bob.  They don't give the real name?  Sure wasn't Susan.  Do they have a picture?  Yeah.  Passable, right?  I'm not making sure I don't know her.  Oh, really?  Can you imagine it was after she visited your apartment?  After Jimmy couldn't get any lower on her.  She realized what she had to do for money.  The last thing she was heard is saying, fat tits and weak chin before she hit the ground. 
[03:49:30]  And then she jumped in Ben's neighborhood there.  Chelsea.  Wow.  Wow.  And there it is.  Is that really the sound you make when you fall, though?  You make a whistle sound and then you make like a bass drum sound when you hit.  It's all fun and games.  The whole way down.  If a woman falls and she's nude, she probably makes a whistle sound.  I love that old gag. 
[03:50:00]  So, if someone else jump in here in New York City.  Nick DiPaolo.  Nick DiPaolo had one of the funny...  And it just died in the comedy cellar because Nick is so mean.  Yes, he is.  It was just hilarious.  And the joke he did was right after one of the suicides.  So, he walks in and he's like, yeah, is it safe to park around here?  I'm afraid I'm going to go out and find a chemistry major's feet sticking out of my roof.  Oh, it's the greatest joke ever.  Not too much pressure on the kids when they're hurling themselves out the window. 
[03:50:30]  Isn't it a lot of Asian children, too, at NYU that were throwing themselves out the window?  There is such pressure put on them by their parents.  Must excel.  Must do good.  Must be best.  And they get these A's, A's, A's, A's.  And then one semester, boom, they hit a B in one of their classes.  And very dishonorable, they must jump out the window.  There was a kid in Boston, yeah, same thing.  Warren Towers at BU.  He got like a B plus and he jumped and he landed right outside someone's window. 
[03:51:00]  And they had to like block it off.  There was pieces of them everywhere.  It was bad.  Yeah, you ruin their 4-0.  The police have to find those expressionless bodies.  You can't tell whether they're frightened from the jump or happy because they just got an A.  Or sad or turned on.  That expressionless face all the way down.  And maybe the little thin lips open into a wider, oh, as they're falling.  Oh.  Oh.  What is he yelling?  Herp. 
[03:51:30]  Herp.  Who wants us to herp him?  I don't want to riv.  Jesus.  That is wrong.  Too much pressure on those kids.  It really is.  To excel.  God almighty, what a big mess.  It must look green.  I mean, with the yellow skin, the red blood.  Oh, now that gets, no.  That is way too inappropriate, even for this program.  I'm very ashamed to be part of this.  Okay.  Getting ready to play. 
[03:52:00]  What did we learn on the O.P. and Anthony show?  We only have like a minute or two left.  One minute left.  Damn, man.  This show flew by today.  Jeff from New Brunswick.  I learned that Norton sounds like he has a three-inch clit in his mouth.  Knuckles from Whackbag.com.  I learned that Tom minus alcohol equals not more gooder.  Chris from Boston.  I learned today.  Hey, boys.  Today I learned the Yankees rally monkey is the neighborhood in which they live in or play in.  Opie's junk is dripping like a strokes victim.  And the O.N.A. show costs seven cents a day.  And he also learned that little Jimmy hates L.A. 
[03:52:30]  John from Long Island.  I learned today I should throw my XM down the toilet, buy a Sirius, and fuck my mother.  Best effing line ever.  Yeah, that's a good one.  Michael from New Hampshire.  I learned that Spicoli was Saddam's puppet.  Springsteen loves Jersey for its whores.  And Private Pile was a Oompa Loompa.  Philly from Vanilla Thunder from Philly.  I learned today Gene Hackman was seen leaving the Reeves house this morning with a kryptonite pillow.  Oh. 
[03:53:00]  Oh.  No, that's funny.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  We got to wrap up here?  One more.  One more.  One more.  We're probably off the air already.  Oh, really?  They cut us off now.  I learned, CJ, I learned today that a girl on her period equals a self-marking wiffleball bat challenge.  There we go.  Are we done, Steve?  Done-ski.  Done.  All right, later.  Hasta mañana.  Opie and Anthony, they are like chocoholics, but for booze.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  I love New York City.  Oh, yeah.  New York City. 
[03:53:30]  I love New York City.  Oh, yeah.  New York City.  That's so amazing.  I love you.  Oh, yeah.  We'll be right back.

[04:01:00]  Do you have disc brakes on your car?  Are the aluminum wheels getting filthy with brake dust?  Engineers have come up with a fix for the brake dust dilemma.  First off, let's talk about how this dust finds its way onto the wheels.  Brake pads are friction material.  In order for brakes to stop a vehicle, friction and the grinding away of pad material must take place.  Pads grind away at the rotors or discs. 
[04:01:30]  Most brake pads are made of a semi-metallic compound.  As the pad material grinds away, superheated metal brake dust embeds into the soft aluminum wheels.  This is what darkens the wheels.  Designers have come up with brake pads composed of ceramic.  This stops the brake dust and has been found to be more durable.  Ceramic pads are made for most vehicles.  Got a question?  Check our website at americascarshow.com.  Hear the full show on XM Channel 166, Saturdays, 2 p.m. Eastern.
