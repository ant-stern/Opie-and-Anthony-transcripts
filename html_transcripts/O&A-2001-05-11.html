<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show’s “WOW Road Trip” broadcast began from a luxurious studio, a stark contrast to their previous workspace.  The hosts, Opie and Anthony,  were joined by Ron and Fez in the studio while they, along with Jim Norton, embarked on their chaotic journey.  The initial segment was rife with vulgar and sexually suggestive humor, featuring discussions about Fez's alleged act of wiping his ass on Opie's microphone and a planned "whipped cream speedo contest" (originally a bikini contest).  Numerous callers contributed to the already raucous atmosphere with their own sexually explicit comments and outrageous stories.  The hosts frequently joked about their disorganized road trip, the reactions of onlookers, and their less-than-ideal travel experiences, frequently getting stuck in traffic, seemingly caused by their own fans.  They gave away various items from their office, including a couch where a couple had anal sex,  and faced numerous technical difficulties and cell service disruptions.  Gino and Richard from the band Filter joined them during a traffic jam, helping announce the Whistler Bikini Contest finalists and upcoming events, including Brother Reed’s show.

The broadcast continued with a discussion about Mike Tyson, punctuated by audio clips of his incoherent speech.  The hosts and guests speculated on Tyson's mental state, attributing it to Zoloft, and used movie analogies (King Kong, Old Yeller) to describe his potential for violence.  Further details emerged about their bus journey, including Stinky’s excessive alcohol consumption and Jim Norton’s sleeping habits.  A live read for Stadium Auto Mall (“no payment until 2002”) and a Mother’s Day Bear Gram advertisement were aired. Anthony launched into a lengthy, expletive-laden tirade recounting his fraught experiences with his ex-mother-in-law, detailing her extended visits, construction requests, and drinking habits.

The show moved to Paramus, New Jersey, at the Garden State Plaza (between The Wiz and Macy’s), where they broadcast outdoors to a large crowd.  Jim Norton was present, and they received vodka from a fan, thanking the Paramus Police Department for their assistance.  Announcements were made for upcoming contests, including a "best body" contest and a "teenage lingerie contest".  A segment featured Jill voluntarily participating in a hot wax dripping segment on her stomach, buttocks, and breasts, with the hosts providing enthusiastic commentary.

A phone call with Rachel Waller followed, who described how her cat, Twinkle, endured 50 minutes in a hot dryer.  Twinkle survived but suffered injuries including a tail amputation and ear damage.  The hosts made numerous sexually suggestive jokes about the incident, repeatedly pressing Rachel for money for Twinkle's vet bills, even suggesting a "Twinkle's Recovery Fund".  Rachel revealed her job as a high school drug counselor and discussed student drug use, providing her email address (WALLACRL@chipfalls.k12.wi.us) for donations.  Back on the road, Opie and Anthony detailed their continued chaotic journey, mentioning stops where they encountered a man selling Pinnacle Horned Goat Weed, their alcohol consumption (Sam Adams beer and vodka), and Stinky's increasingly erratic behavior.  They promoted Pinnacle Horned Goat Weed and Sam Adams beer, along with upcoming concerts, as they headed towards their final Long Island stop, concluding the broadcast.  Throughout the entire broadcast,  the show was punctuated by extensive discussions of Anthony's mother-in-law's terrible driving, specifically her aversion to left turns.  A caller even corroborated this aversion to left turns, relating a similar experience with a coworker.  Further stories detailed a night Anthony drove his intoxicated mother-in-law home from a Boston gig, leading to delays and an angry band, and the removal of Opie's picture from his ex-mother-in-law's house following their marital breakdown.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Nasty.  Ladies and gentlemen, the following statement does not necessarily reflect the opinion of anyone in his right mind.  Now, Alan will demonstrate what having sex with a dead body might sound like.  Please, it's an opium for the show.  1027 WNEW.  Ronnie, look, we made it to the island.  This is it, Buzz.  We're here!  It's everything we've ever dreamed of before.  We just got out of the crappy Running Fest studios and we walked down the hall to the luxurious O&A studios. 
[00:00:30]  Gorgeous.  This is the way Hefner...  Mm-hmm.  If you and Hefner did a radio show, he would do it in here.  Look at this.  Look at these headphones, Ronnie.  Mink!  Mink headphones!  All right, it's the Opie and Anthony show.  Opie and Anthony on the road today doing the WOW road trip.  Yeah, the next stop is Jersey City, the Newport Center Mall on Merrim Boulevard in Jersey City.  Yeah.  All right.  So we got them both on the phone, Fez.  Here they are. 
[00:01:00]  Here's Ant and here's Opie.  Opie and Anthony.  All right.  First off, guys, don't touch anything in our studio.  Huh?  Hey, what's this do?  Don't touch anything.  What does this do?  No, no, no, no!  Don't touch that button.  Is this...  Hey!  Oh, that's...  Wow!  This is nice!  Is everything that right?  First of all...  Hey, wait a minute.  I don't want Fez dancing around that all-time rock and roll and make sure my crystal egg  doesn't get cracked.  It ain't your crystal egg we're answering, it's your crystal mess. 
[00:01:30]  No, it's on the box.  No, it's on the box.  One other thing, no enemas between the hours of 3 and 7, guys.  No.  Oh, why did you tell us earlier?  Please, we gotta sit in those seats.  Too late.  By the way, now, you guys are out today doing the opening at the WOW road trip.  Look who just went in bitching a storm about you guys, the black girl.  Oh, I thought that was their butler.  Yeah.  I thought the studio had a butler.  Earl, what's the problem?  Well, it was even more tragic than the Rosa Parks episode. 
[00:02:00]  We wouldn't even let him come on the back of the bus.  Oh, no.  It was tragic.  We gotta stay back and actually stay at Mission Control.  Oh, boy, why are you late?  What are you saying, Earl?  Earl's asking why you're late.  Oh, I see.  He's trying to get back at us.  Yeah, he's getting back at you.  All the sticker stops he did that really sucked.  I see.  That's funny, Earl.  Earl, why do you think we're doing this today?  If you can't get something done right, you do it yourself. 
[00:02:30]  All right, Fez just wiped his ass all over Opie's microphone.  That sounds good.  That's what Solid Gold feels like.  He calls himself the Solid Gold Dancer.  All right, where are you guys heading next?  And why?  I don't know.  And why?  Why are you doing this?  Wait, this isn't the way to my house.  What are you driving me? 
[00:03:00]  I don't know where the hell we're going.  Where are you at?  What's our ETA, as they say in the technical term?  We're ten minutes.  We're ten minutes away from the next stop, whatever that stop may be.  And that's the Jersey City stop?  Correct.  The Newport Center Mall.  That's a lot of information, guys.  Correct.  Guys, you're doing afternoon drive radio now in New York City.  Wow, isn't this exciting?  Is it?  I keep looking over.  I'm going, is Jay Moore calling in, you know?  Dice?  Yeah, I got Dice. 
[00:03:30]  Do I got Dice here?  Do I got Mick Foley?  It's my favorite radio personality.  Oh!  Which way?  Hey, if this bus crashed, how quick before those guys start to kiss our asses, huh?  No, if this bus crashed, you'd be playing promos for Ron and Fez 3 to 7.  Right, sure we would.  In a second.  Hey, if this bus crashed, we'd be playing 80s music all weekend to get everyone ready.  Oh, man.  Hey, also guys, Gary Coleman's on line 13 on hold. 
[00:04:00]  Please keep him on hold for us.  I'm going to leave him on for a while and let him think about it.  Let him think about what he has to say.  All right.  Wow, we're in a great neighborhood.  Stay back from the windows.  You can batten down the hatches.  Everyone huddle in the center of the bus.  It's like girls' families having a reunion.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  You know, we're buying a car wash.  Yeah.  What a white... 
[00:04:30]  Hold on, Gary.  Something bad happened.  That's my fault.  All right.  Let me check back to see.  Hey, guys, do we still got you?  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah, we're still here now.  Okay.  I don't know what the hell happened there.  What's the matter?  You didn't want that content on the run and fake stuff?  Right.  Yeah, we don't...  It's a little too controversial.  I tell you, boys, you don't have to work blue.  You're funny.  You don't need that stuff.  I know.  God, not how many times we've heard that.  Seriously.  Funny, not mean.  What's the difference here?  Right.  Funny, not dirty.  Funny, not dirty. 
[00:05:00]  Funny, not dirty.  Remember that, Opie.  I like that.  Well, we got to go, because the Vietnam phone's getting a little heavy.  Right.  All right, guys, so call us when you get there, because this is, you know, your show.  Right.  And we'd love to hear from you.  Well, take care of it, nurture it, and have fun with it, guys.  All right.  Yes, don't worry.  What's in my pants, Ronnie?  It looks like a penis, only it's smaller.  Correct!  Oh, they've probably jumped out.  They do that from me. 
[00:05:30]  Oh, do they?  Oh, I forget.  See, we can say all that stuff.  Okay.  All right, guys, so we're right back.  Jeez.  That is unbelievable.  Look at us, sitting on thrones, Ronnie.  It's like being on Mount Olympus.  They give me a little stool to sit on.  And that is it.  And then we come in here, and there's thrones, actual thrones.  That little stool that you're sitting on there, you actually dropped it first.  Yes.  Made up.  Oh, geez.  Oh, geez.  Who do I go to?  Well, let's see.  And I believe that's a bidet.  I could go to Brian Regan now. 
[00:06:00]  I could go to Jimmy Brewer.  The opportunity.  Yeah.  They're endless here.  I guess in this show, you just open up the phones and let people call and entertain.  I understand that behind that one door there, nothing but cash, Ronnie.  Is that right?  Just cash.  Yeah.  Big room for cash.  That's in case anything happens.  Mm-hmm.  What happens?  It's in there.  All right.  Hey, Oscar, you're on the O.P. and Anthony show.  Hi, Oscar.  All right.  Hold on.  We got a problem here.  We're not the same person running board. 
[00:06:30]  Hey, ask.  Hey, what's up, fellas?  What do you say?  Hi, Oscar.  If this is not an example of Earth 2, I have no idea what is.  The next thing I know, I'm going to see Fezz's girlfriend running around the streets  of New York.  That would be true.  This, on Earth though, we are really doing this shift.  Oh, nice.  Yeah.  Syndication when you guys get to a show.  All right.  Peace.  Yeah.  I know.  When are we going to get syndicated?  All right.  That's guys.  Syndication now.  That's what I say.  Hey, Tyler, you're on run at Fezz.  Hello, Tyler.  What? 
[00:07:00]  Is that Opie?  Yeah.  It sounds so damn gay.  Hello.  It's me, Opie.  Hey, Opie, how's your girlfriend in Canada doing?  My girlfriend in Niagara Falls, Ontario, Canada?  Quite well.  Thank you.  By the way, the whipped cream bikini contest, don't bring any guys up in the studio.  Yeah.  Where is that today?  How come that's not happening?  We'll be doing the whipped cream speedo contest.  Changing it up just a little bit.  We're in charge, Ronnie.  We're running around the candy store.  Opie and Anthony come back and there's a couple of hairy guys with whipped cream on 
[00:07:30]  their nuts.  Oh, this is great.  Thanks.  What can I tell you, Watley?  We leave you here for an hour.  Gee whiz.  877-692-1027.  You know, probably we can actually just let people say whatever they want on this show  that they can't normally say between three and seven.  Oh, okay.  And a soccer patty.  Could have...  She could have a free run.  She could have a manifesto.  Whatever she wants to do.  Hey, Tom.  Tom, you're on a manifesto.  I mean, I'm sorry. 
[00:08:00]  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Right.  How are you doing?  Good.  Good.  I'm just going to tell you a stunt that I used to pull at traffic lights.  If you started blowing the horn.  Yeah.  I'd get out of the car and open up the hood and stand there and watch my engine running.  And then I would look around at you and I asked you if you knew anything about cars.  Right.  Because mine's not...  Won't run.  Then I'd put the hood down and now everybody's blowing the horn and I would wait just about  till the light changed and then take off and leave them all sitting there. 
[00:08:30]  So you've got nothing to do with your life then.  That's right.  This is all you do.  That's right.  You have no place to go.  No life at all.  No.  None whatsoever.  All right.  Face.  Okay.  So bored.  He's trying to fill up the time between green lights.  Oh, look.  O and A are calling again.  They are.  O and A.  Okay.  Opie and Anthony.  You're on Opie and Anthony.  Go ahead.  You guys are ruining our show.  We're ruining it.  How are we ruining it?  This is going great.  Guys and whipped cream don't match. 
[00:09:00]  The whipped cream speedo contest is off.  The Fed claims that you left a note and it was okay.  Yes.  That sucks.  This is signed.  Hey, by the way, you should tell everyone that the whipped cream bikini contest, we're  down at four girls.  We will announce the winner on Monday when we're back to like normal and not playing for  hookey from our radio.  Hold on a second.  I want to say.  Why don't we just pick right now?  Me and Fezz will pick.  Yeah.  How's it going, guys?  You taking care of the storm?  Kind of.  So far, so good.  We found that big room. 
[00:09:30]  I see you're taking some calls and they might be confused.  Yeah.  Just be careful with our listeners.  Believe me.  Everything's fine.  You guys go.  Have a great time.  Don't worry about anything here.  Everything's good.  I guess we'll start giving out money to the ninth caller.  We found a big room full of it.  Yeah.  Hold on.  Maybe we'll do this.  Go down to ONA's office and find something fun and we'll give it out.  Oh, okay.  Out of their office?  Yeah.  All right. 
[00:10:00]  We are in charge.  We are in charge.  We are in charge.  And they're a cell phone cutting out again.  Yeah.  Just so they know that.  Maybe something personal in there so we can give away to a lucky winner.  Nice.  Some shoes or something.  Now, next, they are going to the Jersey City Newport Center Mall.  On Marin Boulevard.  They should be there momentarily.  Hey, Eric, you're on a round of Fezz.  Yeah.  You're on a round of Fezz.  You're on a round of Fezz.  You're on a round of Fezz.  You're on a round of Fezz.  You're on a round of Fezz.  You're on a round of Fezz.  You're on a round of Fezz.  Hey, Eric, you're on a round of Fezz. 
[00:10:30]  What do you want happening on the Absin' O&A show today?  Hey, Eric.  Hey, guys.  Listen, I was just wondering.  I mean, you know, since this is the O&A round of Fezz sort of thing,  why don't we have some O&A regulars call in, maybe like Gay Marco?  Uh-huh.  Or, you know, someone to call in.  I mean, you know, let's keep the listeners up to date with all the O&A regulars, I guess.  It would be nice to get to know you.  Exactly.  Back to you, Rusty.  Oh, Fezzy.  I'm sorry.  Love to get to know the O&A listeners. 
[00:11:00]  And invite you to hang out noon on Monday.  Oh, you're going for that angle now, aren't you?  Uh-huh.  All right.  If you like whipped cream, tune in at noon on Monday.  Yeah.  We're not doing that.  All kinds of stuff like that.  Are you guys back now, O&A?  Is this line working?  Hey, guys.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You there?  Yeah.  It's an opioid in the head with a foot.  What a nightmare this place is.  And you should have seen the last stop.  Taz Elliott wowed us.  That was really nice. 
[00:11:30]  I didn't know whether to stick a sticker on her chest or a ham snail like in her throat  like a choker.  And it was awful.  Somebody under 500 pounds show up and show your breath.  That'd be nice.  That'd be nice.  So you're having fun, though.  You're having a good time.  I'm having a great time.  Good.  The security guard.  The guy was 100.  He wanted me to find his colostomy bag before he left.  So you're having a good time.  I'm just trying to find something with a vagina that will talk to me.  All right.  We'll see if that didn't get dumped out of. 
[00:12:00]  No.  It's also working.  Oh, you can say that because technically it's correct.  Right.  Uh-huh.  And we're in charge.  I'm going to quit answering.  You guys are doing a terrific job as I see another large black man leaping into a dumpster.  Thanks, Garnton.  All right, buddy.  He's such a good man.  He's friendly.  He's friendly in his own way.  He has a good time anywhere he goes.  He has fun in his own way, doesn't he?  Yeah, he really does.  He's so right about the neighborhood.  Can we get a helicopter to get us out of here or something? 
[00:12:30]  I need to get an airstruck.  I'm not pause.  Hey, we put together a new game show where we start to give our stuff out of your office.  Oh, out of our office?  Yeah.  Okay.  Is that okay?  If you want to give something away, go into the office, pick it up, and find.  I think that is probably going to be Ninth Caller wins Opie's computer.  Uh-huh.  What is this Opie's computer?  Mine, I'm very involved in a game right now, and I don't want that disturbed.  Give it away.  All right.  What about this?  The Slave Girls tape that you guys have? 
[00:13:00]  Oh, that can be slap-happy.  Opie has a suggestion.  Hold on.  All right.  Good.  Damn, I might keep the Slave Girls for myself.  You guys, this is going to be a big coup for you guys today, okay?  Oh, yeah.  It's happening.  I can feel it.  Ken Stevens' leather couch that the couple had the anal on.  His ass couch?  Ken Stevens' ass couch?  I've been asking him for that for months.  No, we've been planning on giving that away for months.  I said you guys give it away today. 
[00:13:30]  All right.  Wow.  Give away the leather couch from Ken Stevens' office that the couple had anal on.  I'm not kidding, right?  We can do that.  Jeremy's nodding yes.  Is that right?  Jeremy says yes?  Jeremy says yes.  Give it up Ken Stevens' anal couch.  All right.  The way we're going to do it is we'll bring couples in to have anal on it, and then the best  one gets it and cannot be the judge.  And Fezzy, you work for the company, so you don't qualify.  All right.  Damn.  I'll just make my own ass couch.  So there. 
[00:14:00]  All right.  We've got to go.  We're here.  We haven't seen any white people yet.  All right.  Oh, my God.  You've made it to Jersey City's Newport Center Mall on Marron Boulevard.  Yeah, we've just got to figure out where we're going to be.  Do we know where we're going to be in this mall?  No one knows.  Watch out for security.  Yo, can we find a Starbucks?  I think we'd be safe outside of a Starbucks.  All right, guys.  We've got to go.  All right. 
[00:14:30]  I hate this place.  The Medicaid doesn't work.  I hate this place.  I've been here seven years.  Basically just playing hooky from work.  This does not sound like what you would call a real promotion.  No, uh-uh.  And it's just going mall to mall at this point.  Yeah, it's mall to mall.  And if you look at the itinerary that you can find on WNEW.com, Jersey City Newport Center Mall is at 2 o'clock, Ronnie.  All right, so they're a good hour and 20 minutes behind. 
[00:15:00]  Hour and 20 minutes off the schedule at this point.  But, I mean, just running around from mall to mall, wasn't this a Tiffany tour at one time?  Or who the hell came up with this itinerary?  I think we are alone now.  Everything was so cool with the whole beanpost thing earlier.  Right.  That was huge.  And now they're running around to malls that they're not really even invited to.  Yeah, not welcome.  They got chased out of the Staten Island Mall on Richmond Avenue.  The security guard pulled up with the yellow light and said, keep it moving. 
[00:15:30]  And now they're at the Newport Center Mall.  And after that, it's going to be Paramus, the Garden State Plaza.  All right, let me just check on this.  Why no brakes now?  They have less brakes than us?  We're running more than scrap?  I believe they go every half an hour.  Wow!  Do they?  Who set up their clock?  I do not know, sir.  Well, that's the kind of stuff our producers should know.  Yeah, they should tell us about.  We're getting ready to throw it off to commercials. 
[00:16:00]  And everyone's just staring at us.  Now keep talking.  No, you keep on going.  Okay.  Hey, Dave, you're on Running Fest.  Hi, Dave.  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Good.  Listen, I think you should yell at O&A for having crappy cell phones and having their  radio on in the background.  No kidding.  It's not right.  It's not right that they could do that, even if it is their own show.  Practice what you preach.  Take care, guys.  Have a good one.  Practice what you preach.  Hey, Jason, you're on the O&A show.  Hi, Jason. 
[00:16:30]  Hey, I'm on the couch.  No.  I'm on the couch.  I'm on the couch.  I'm on the couch.  He needs that ass couch.  You stay off that ass couch, Jason.  Sorry, Jason.  Can I have the little bit of that?  I'm not so sure I even believe that you can give away the ass couch story.  Who's all on the...  And you see, Rick is walking around.  Rick, how come you're not on the bus?  What happened?  What's going on, Rick?  Well, I had a slight problem with a similar bus incident a few months ago.  Oh, yeah.  Didn't you go to prison for a while? 
[00:17:00]  Yeah.  All right.  28 hours and a clink, so I decided to sit this one out and let them get in trouble.  You've now developed a bus fear.  Yes.  It's a phobia.  Let me get you past this.  You need some time on the ass couch.  Yes.  Hey, Steve.  You're on the bed.  Yeah, buddy.  Hi, Steve.  I want to say congratulations to Jeremy Coleman and Ken Stevens for finally getting syndicated  hosts for afternoon drive.  Ouch.  All right.  Although our show is...  What?  How mean?  Our show is syndicated when and where?  In like in the middle of the night, like a three o'clock in the morning deal. 
[00:17:30]  Yeah.  In very small markets.  Yeah.  But they're trying.  Do you have to be on live in the other markets to be syndicated?  Yeah.  To be officially syndicated.  Do that, boys.  All right.  Peace.  Every once in a while, I'll get like an email from some guy in Tulsa who says I work overnights  in the prison and I just want you guys to know you're hysterical.  You really make the graveyard shift for us.  Right.  And we're like...  Huh?  And who knows what they're sending out at night, Ronnie? 
[00:18:00]  Yeah, no kidding.  Hey, Mike, you're on Opie and Anthony.  Hi, Mike.  This is so weird.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show.  How are you?  Go ahead.  I got an idea for a giveaway.  Yeah, go ahead.  I think you should give away Opie's desk to the first person who could get down there  with a flatbed trailer.  Actually, that'd be a lot of fun.  That is nice.  We know.  And just to make you guys feel at home?  Yeah.  You suck.  I'm going to listen to myself.  Thank you.  I'll tell you.  I feel a big time now.  Don't you feel welcome? 
[00:18:30]  Yeah.  Don't you feel embraced?  No, I don't know how long it would take to get a flatbed truck down here.  We know how long it took a bus to get out of the neighborhood.  Hey, Karen.  Karen, you're on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Hi, Karen.  Hi, guys.  How are you?  Hi, bud.  The Garden State Parking Mall.  Yes?  With Allison that won the Best Buns contest.  Mm-hmm.  And we want to know if anybody else is in the mall parking lot.  If they would call in and let us know.  It's difficult to know because they're not saying exactly where they are in this mall parking 
[00:19:00]  lot.  No, we're waiting at the one at Paramus.  You're waiting at the Garden State Plaza.  Oh, gee.  Right.  And I'm right by Macy's.  Okay.  So if anyone else is going ahead of the caravan.  Yeah.  Why are you running one ahead?  Why are you doing that, Karen?  Why?  Because I have Allison with me from the Best Buns contest.  Oh.  We want to see Opie and Anthony.  Okay.  So if anyone else is already at the Garden State Plaza.  There's a girl with a great ass there. 
[00:19:30]  Mm-hmm.  Look for Karen outside the Macy's entrance.  How about just put her ass out the window?  Okay, Allison.  Put your ass out the window so everybody can find us.  I can see it from here.  Okay, guys.  Thank you.  All right.  Bye-bye.  Bye.  Is she waving?  I can't tell.  This is a weird promotion.  Opie and Anthony's wow road trip, Fuzzy.  Mm-hmm.  At Jersey City right now.  The Newport Center Mall.  Marin Boulevard.  So they'll be there for just a little while.  Before they move on to Paramus. 
[00:20:00]  We'll be right back.  We're Opie and Anthony.  It's kind of like a car wreck on the highway.  You're going to have to, you know,  tune in to see what the hell these idiots are doing next.  Opie and Anthony.  We refuse to be responsible.  So go screw yourself.  We refuse to be responsible.  1-0-2-7-N-E-W.  All right.  Mother's Day is this Sunday.  And what says happy Mother's Day more than monkeys?  Crazy little monkeys.

[00:21:30]  All afternoon.  Opie and Anthony's WOW Road Trip on WNEW.  Welcome to the Afternoon Thought of Pain.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  You're listening to Bizarre World Train on 1027 WNEW.  It is the WOW Road Trip, running fast here in the Opie and Anthony studio. 
[00:22:00]  Opie and Anthony are out right now.  At Jersey City, Newport Center Mall on Merrim Boulevard.  It's a very short time before they head off to Paramus.  We've got them both on the phones.  Opie and Anthony, what's up, guys?  Jersey City is rocking.  It's in Jersey City, Ron, and says,  Yes, it's in the mountains. 
[00:22:30]  Unbelievable.  They currently have every white person in the show up.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Don't be right here.  Everyone loves the Bellevue show.  Yeah, the Bellevue show.  We got you, Newton, in there.  Can you have a couple of observations?  Jim.  Hello, Ron and Ferris.  Hey, guys.  Hey, Newton.  A lot of white people right here.  It's good. 
[00:23:00]  One black guy walked over, realized we weren't raffling up a white girl, and he left.  He gave him a wow sticker, but he said, I can't read this.  All right, good.  Now that I've just pissed off the entire city, we're going to leave.  Don't ring the bell on that one.  It wasn't that bad.  I didn't say it can't burn.  Wait till we're on the bus.  Jim Norton, what a treat to have him on board this bus.  And he's happy today, which is nice.  It's nice to see he's mingling. 
[00:23:30]  Ron, if that's how is it, 3 to 7.  That's W.  Are you kidding me?  It's perfect.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Have they brought the gold doubloons in for you like they do for us every day?  Yeah.  You know, hey, you know, Don and Mike were right.  This is the shift to get right here.  Right.  Are you going to try for this one now?  Believe me, you're never going to make it in this business.  Neither one of you.  This is all we've ever wanted.  Oh, my God. 
[00:24:00]  By the way, we canceled the massage lady.  Oh, my God.  That's great.  Well, Fez has his own massage guy coming by later.  Thank you, Fez.  Oh, I'm seeing mall security.  Oh, no, I'm seeing mall security.  They're on their radios, which really means something.  Either there's a shoplifter in the gap or we have really caused some problems.  By the way, guys, people want to know where exactly at the mall you are. 
[00:24:30]  By the big group of white people.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, I don't even know where we are.  Does anyone know where we are if they want to know on the radio?  Newport Mall in Jersey City.  I know, but we know where in Jersey City by the Newport Mall.  Mall drive left.  Mall drive left.  Whatever the hell left is.  I can see that.  Spears, Spears.  Spears, okay.  I see it.  Okay.  I like that.  We are like the Tiffany of radio. 
[00:25:00]  We're on the mall tour.  Someone screams, you're in Jersey City.  Right.  All right, guys, you hold the ship down.  Oh, yeah, we're holding it underwater, don't we?  And make sure we have a show to come back to on Monday.  Sure.  So you can announce the whipped cream bikini contest winner.  Yes.  Yeah, okay.  Don't ruin it.  Everything's going to be perfect just where you left it.  Thank you, Ron and Fez.  This is great.  It was either us or Pete Johnson from the Don and Mike show. 
[00:25:30]  You got it.  All right, we'll call you when we approach the next.  Do you hear the siren?  Oh, dear.  More siren.  More siren.  This is legal, isn't it?  No, kind of.  All right, yeah.  Now that he's on the scene.  Should we stay on with you?  Why don't we see if you need legal help?  Oh, no.  I don't think she can do that.  Or I'll come call another lawyer.  No, no, no, no. 
[00:26:00]  Well, it looks like we might be leaving shortly.  Yeah.  They block?  They're blocking us?  We've got a grandma that wants to say hi to everybody.  Okay.  Where'd she come from?  All right.  Grandma, how old the girl are you?  She's deaf, Ron, in fact, and she can't talk.  Yeah, she's shining. 
[00:26:30]  Oh, that's good.  Yeah, we're showing her our mom stickers.  Right.  For mom, for Mother's Day.  She's wondering why Opie and Anthony and WNEW are on Upside Down.  But it's a mom sticker.  Let's park to the old black lady.  Oh, you like the wow?  Wow.  How old the girl are you?  You don't want to say your age, do you?  Come on, give us a ballpark figure.  You're 75 and 80.  You're between 75 and 80.  Now, you know about wow? 
[00:27:00]  You know about Whip Em Out Wednesday?  No.  Okay, then it's women of the world.  Yeah, women of the world, it's a women's empowerment group.  Yeah, you put that on your car and it shows that you are a woman, a strong woman, that  is empowered in this world.  What do you feel about that?  Fine.  Fine.  Fine.  So you put that on your car.  Thank you for coming down.  She made a piss.  Earl's mom.  Oh, my God.  Here's a ballpark figure on her age.  She's older than Ebbets Field. 
[00:27:30]  Older than Ebbets Field.  That's a ballpark figure.  I don't want to say how old, somewhere in my late 70s.  Right.  I don't want to give it away.  Yeah.  Is it above 70?  Does shaving off five years count?  Does it really matter?  Either way, you had front row seats at World War I.  All right.  Can we get some?  Our bus is now up on Starbucks.  We need tires.  We need tires for the bus.  Well, you're right at Sears.  You're fine. 
[00:28:00]  Well, they're telling us we've got to wrap this up and move on to the next location.  We're going to be about two hours late.  Where are we going next?  Do you guys know?  We're going to Paramus.  Paramus.  Paramus.  Yeah.  It should be really cool.  Garden State Plaza.  Everyone's going to follow us to Paramus.  Everyone's going to follow us to Paramus.  We got us a convoy.  Oh, Jesus.  We're wearing uniforms.  All right, guys.  Keep it up.  Hold down, Chip, and we'll check in with you later.  All right.  We'll talk to you soon, boys. 
[00:28:30]  All right, Opie and Anthony.  All right.  Heading out of Jersey City now.  Leaving the Newport Center Mall and headed to Paramus, the Garden State Plaza.  You can meet them there.  Opie and Anthony, as the WOW road trip continues.  No, you know, it's starting to pick up steam, Fez.  You're having more and more fun.  Uh-huh.  They're having more and more fun.  And the convoy is growing, and I think they're emptying out that Jersey City Mall.  Now, what a feeling of trust that they've given us an extra hour.  Just to lounge around in here in the big studio.  Yeah, it looks nice. 
[00:29:00]  This is nice.  This is nice.  Hey, Donnie.  Donnie, you're on the Opie and Anthony show.  Hi, Donnie.  Hey, Ron and Fez.  How are we doing today?  What's up, big dog?  I just wanted to thank you guys for taking the helm and helping O&A with their farewell  score.  I mean, their WOW sticker score.  It's a pleasure.  It's a pleasure.  It's a pleasure.  Good to hear you guys in the afternoon.  All right.  Talk to you later.  This is great to be sitting in here.  I mean, big fluffy pillows, everything.  Oh, yeah.  This is comfy.  My bad ass get used to this. 
[00:29:30]  Hey, Mike, you're on the O&A show.  How you doing?  Ron?  Yes.  How are you?  Good.  You're in.  Yes, we are.  All right.  Right.  Let's take notice.  All right.  You guys listen up.  I supplied all this ball security in Paramus with firearms and roofies, okay?  They're going to try to take care of Opie and Anthony.  Right.  You guys got to look around.  Find out what you need to know.  Take the information down.  All right?  Now listen.  Jesus, trace this call.  Trace this call.  It's like a Beretta call in the middle of the day. 
[00:30:00]  I wait in the car.  You go get your gun out of the restaurant.  Look who's on the phone right here.  It's Angel Amy.  Amy, how you doing?  Hey, guys.  Hi, Angel Amy.  Hey.  Welcome to the afternoon flight.  I thought you would be up on Opie and Anthony's bus around.  I wish I could, but no.  They're too far away from me.  Where are you at?  I'm at home.  I don't know where that is.  I'm like in Central Jersey.  What are you up to today?  Oh, nothing.  Just sitting here listening to you guys. 
[00:30:30]  I can actually get used to this.  Do you think I care about your life?  Do you think I care about your life?  We don't want you to feel a little too homesick.  Do you think I care about your life?  I miss your guy's show a lot.  Do you think I care about your life?  Do you think I care about your life?  Uh, Opie left that for you, honey.  What?  Opie left you a message.  Do you think I care about your life?  I know what it is.  Uh-huh.  Right.  All right, Amy.  All right.  Take care of yourself, honey.  All right.  We have recorded responses for all the callers. 
[00:31:00]  Why just Angel Amy?  What we should...  It would make it a lot easier if he had left a message for all of them.  What we should do, probably, is, uh, have a situation where we just have them say yes,  no, call back.  Right.  Mm-hmm.  I'll buy that.  Puma!  Puma!  Puma!  Hey, uh, let's see.  Derek, Derek, you're on the, uh, Opie and Anthony show.  Hi, Derek.  What's up, fellas?  Hey, man.  How you doing?  Good. 
[00:31:30]  Hey, why does something tell me you're going to be going on until about 7 o'clock tonight?  I think it's going to be more than an hour.  You think?  Oh, yeah.  Those boys ain't no mood to work today.  No.  There's no way they're going to get back in time.  That's true.  Actually, uh, we're just hanging around for an hour and then they're going to play some  of their best of.  Mm-hmm.  And then do breaks in and out of it.  No, but here's your chance.  Why don't you take the job?  Just take the job and run with it, huh, baby?  I'm just thrilled being able to go in their office, too.  The champagne.  There's a refrigerator just for champagne in there.  All right, boys.  Keep up the good work. 
[00:32:00]  All right.  We'll take a little break here, Fez.  All right.  In the big studio, in the Opie and Anthony studio.  Woo!  We're running Fez for O and A.  All right, here comes.  Anthony is evil, but Opie is worse than Hitler.  We're off to a flying start here on the, uh, Opie and, uh, Cool and Inhuman show.  1027 WNEW.  Saturday night, starting at 7.  WNEW gets you, Fez.  Hey, what's up, Weezer?  And cheese.  And cheese.  And cheese.  And cheese.  And cheese.  And cheese.

It's after 3 p.m. Mother's Day is this Sunday.  No need to panic, people.  You can still be a hero and send your mom a bear gram from the Vermont Teddy Bear Company.

[00:34:00]  O.B.  What is it going to take for us to fish you off to the point  where you're going to change the station?  That's what I need to know.  Shove it.  Anthony.  Boy, it sure is easy to be a fag on this show, isn't it?  That's going to be trouble.  O.B.  And Anthony.  We just refuse a PhD in stupidity.  1-0-2-7.  W-N-E-W.  For Ramis, you are next on the hit list.  Garden State Plaza.  That's where the WOW road trip is headed to right now as we speak. 
[00:34:30]  O.B.  and Anthony headed there with the WOW stickers.  What a nice promotion these guys have got going today, Fuzzy.  This is nice.  Yeah, it's very nice to them.  They're going out and meeting people and getting drunk at the same time,  which is wonderful.  And able to chuck it all up to business.  Yeah.  To work in.  Doing that business.  Mm-hmm.  All right, let's take some phone calls here.  We're still waiting for O.B. and Anthony to call us back from the road.  877-692-1027.  Look who's on the phone, Fuzzy.  It's Dan from Hoboken. 
[00:35:00]  Dan.  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hey, how are you?  You got me all confused.  I don't know whether there's instant feedback or call or...  You don't know what the hell's happening now, do you?  What's going on?  You guys going all the way to 7th?  We would, except for there's an airplane trip taking place a little later on.  All right.  In a couple of hours.  And, of course, the boss didn't bring it up to us until, what, Tuesday?  Yeah.  Yeah.  If that.  Yeah.  All right.  Talk to you later, Dan.  Bye, boy.  Thanks.  Yeah, in case anyone works a late shift and you think you're still listening to Ron and 
[00:35:30]  Fad, you're not.  No, you're late for work.  O.B. and Anthony's on.  Hey, Heckler, you're on O.B. and Anthony.  Hey, just wanted to check in, say hello.  Glad to see you on the island.  It's sort of like when you used to watch Johnny Carson and David Brennan's sitting there hosting  and also now we have Joan Rivers there sitting there.  Yeah, anything can happen right about now.  Can you push a few buttons?  Can we hear a few of those famous sound waves they play?  No.  Oh, hell no.  They didn't even leave their stuff here.  Can't play with the buttons.  No.  They didn't leave the buttons here to play.  They're very smart.  How about a nature boy on this time slot? 
[00:36:00]  Maybe that'll get through.  All right.  Thanks, Heckler.  Love you guys.  Peace.  Yeah, pal.  Here's O.A.  They're back on the phone, Fuzzy.  And they're traveling next to Paramus, Garden State Plaza.  O.B. and Anthony.  Ronnie Fez, it's O.B.  And we're about 200 yards outside of the mall that we were just at a half hour ago.  Oh, really?  Wow, nice.  We're stuck in traffic.  Yeah, traffic.  So, this thing's probably not as well-planned as we wanted it to be, right? 
[00:36:30]  Hello?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Anthony, I'm losing them.  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  I don't think they're really losing us, Ronnie.  I think they're trying to F with us.  Are you guys there?  Yes.  Yeah.  Jersey's great.  I swear to God, I just saw Paulie Walnut strangle a guy underneath a train trestle.  It was great.  It's like living the Sopranos. 
[00:37:00]  Hello?  Hello?  Don't you play the silent game with me.  This is our show, you son of a bitch.  I know that game.  I know it.  They're playing the silent game with me, Opie.  Oh!  Oh!  Hey.  Hey, let me tell you something.  We're not going to dump it on our show.  This is your time.  You're going to dump it on our show.  We didn't do anything.  I'm sorry.  I just said the other word.  You have to host him. 
[00:37:30]  Tell him stuff on his own show.  I have to get you, uh, your attention.  You seem to be playing the silent game, and I know that works.  Yeah.  We've got a plan for the rest of the show, guys.  Well.  We'll be there until, uh, seven.  Well, we would be here, except for if Fezzy's got a plane to catch.  I don't care what...  No, Fezzy's not flying anywhere.  Yeah.  He doesn't need a plane, Tinkerbell.  Oh, that's right.  That would get me to say.  Yeah, where is that?  You know what I'm saying?  You have the charisma.  No.  Oh, you're a mean drunk. 
[00:38:00]  Back in the company days.  You know he's engaged.  Yeah.  I know.  His wife.  I've seen his future wife, and she's very attractive.  Really?  Aside from the five o'clock shadow.  But she's very gorgeous.  She looks like Fez.  Ben.  Opie wants the phone.  All right.  It's like talking to Grandma here.  I want to talk to Grandma.  Hold on.  Hi, Grandma.  How's your grave?  Good.  You guys, remember I just said we were in traffic? 
[00:38:30]  Yeah.  So I did some investigating.  And it turns out that our own people are making us be in this traffic jam.  We're surrounded with cars with WOW on it.  Oh, Jesus.  And that's why we're not moving.  Right.  You're not your own convoi.  Pretty much surrounded us and has stopped the flow of traffic.  Thank you.  If you guys are listening in your cars, you know, could you maybe allow the bus to move forward  so we can get the parameters before the sun goes down?  Why do I have the feeling that if this was behind the music, everything would start going bad right about now? 
[00:39:00]  Well, this is the idea that went wrong.  This is where the bus gets buzzed.  The idea went wrong when we left the building at noon today.  Who are you, Ken?  They're saying that this is where the idea went wrong, Anthony.  You know, it went wrong many, many hours ago, as you know.  Yeah.  I just want to remind people to continue voting for the Whipped Cream Bikini Contest, of course.  We're down to four girls.  We're going to announce the winner on Monday when we're back to normal, hopefully.  I get it. 
[00:39:30]  You're going to...  Also, just a quick program reminder.  One of my buds is coming into town, Brother Weiss.  He does, like, the Saturday night show.  Yeah.  And he's going to be live from NEW studios tomorrow night, and I'm going to be hanging  and doing the show with him as well.  So, please, O&A listeners, you know, check Weiss.  We're going to have fun tomorrow night also, okay?  Are you also going to stay and do the metal show or Saturday Night Rocks?  That's not a bad idea.  That would be cool.  Play some of the old stuff.  Yeah.  Play some of the old stuff.  That could be fun. 
[00:40:00]  Maybe I'll come back from that.  All right.  Hold on.  Norton has danked it on my sleeve.  Hold on.  Norton's got material.  Norton's out today on this fun, wow, road trip.  Okay.  We're in a lot of traffic.  Yeah.  Yeah, and it's really irritating.  And Melissa is sitting here with a nice rip in the side of her jeans, and I have a spot  in my boxers the size of a baby's head.  Now, what's Melissa wearing?  What's that, buddy?  What's Melissa wearing?  You have to say it again because this phone stinks. 
[00:40:30]  What is she wearing?  What's she looking like?  She's wearing a very lovely light purple shirt with no back and little jeans ripping the  side, and I'm going to guess a white song.  Oh, jeez.  Yeah, it's not that I position it in the toilet to look up.  It's a panty psychic.  But this is, we'll get on the Palacios Skyway.  There is less traffic and Independence Day.  This is tough.  So I'll put you back on with the boys. 
[00:41:00]  I'm really irritated right now.  Okay, good.  All right, guys.  What's our next stop?  Your next stop is Paramus.  You're headed towards the Garden State Plaza.  We'll be there in August.  All right.  We're not exactly located.  Yeah, and we'll check back to you when we get close.  Okay.  All right, guys.  Talk to you soon.  That's Obi and Anthony live from the road on the WOW road trip.  We had some calls that the people are already waiting at Paramus at the Garden State Plaza. 
[00:41:30]  We'll keep waiting.  They're stuck in traffic, but they're on their way.  Less traffic and Independence Day.  What a joy to have on the road.  I know.  All right.  Here's somebody who says they're right up next to the tour bus, the Obi and Anthony WOW road trip bus.  It's Dave.  Dave, how's it going, buddy?  Hey, Dave.  It's not going good.  I was probably about one car behind the bus there on the left-hand side.  I just wanted to throw some WOW stickers in my sunroof there so I can get on my way,  and I wouldn't have to follow them all the way to the next stop. 
[00:42:00]  It's just like the white man that skipped a black man.  I just get here, and then you're leaving.  Right.  Okay.  So it's their fault.  Their fault?  They show up two hours late, and yet you didn't get there yet.  It's always the man's fault.  It's not my fault.  All right.  There you go, Dave.  Peace.  877-692-1027.  All right, Rick's in here.  Rick, you're going to do some best-of stuff today?  Yeah.  As soon as you guys figure you want to blow out, just let me know, and we'll hook up with some best-of stuff.  What time are you going to catch your plan? 
[00:42:30]  What time is the car coming for you?  The car's coming for me at 4.30, but it's coming to my apartment, so I can go back to my apartment by then.  You've got to scramble that way.  Right.  Oh, a car.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, Fez's gun town car.  Wow.  You'll see him tonight on one of those livery drivers getting shot promos that they're doing on the nose every night.  Another livery driver is reamed.  I thought I saw a member of his family at the Carnegie Deli shooting last night.  Just eating, not shooting.  That's right. 
[00:43:00]  He's been here for hours and didn't move.  Didn't move during the shooting at all.  Hey, Eric, you're on OPNF me.  What's up, R&F?  Listen, I have a new bit maybe you guys could just end the show with.  It's never really been done before.  Why don't you guys do something, take some calls, and go, you know, what did I learn on the Ron and Fez show tonight?  Ah, there you go.  You know, you could end the show that way, and then, you know, you're off to the airplane, Fezzy, and that's the way it goes.  You know, here's what I like.  Now I feel like all these bits are our bits.  It's all of us together.  It's shared property at this point. 
[00:43:30]  Yeah, it's shared stuff.  It's very communal.  Maybe we can start having Norton stop by on our show.  That'd be nice.  Mr. Warmth.  Forget Don Rickles.  We got a new Mr. Warmth.  All right, now also we got a little bad news here.  Hey, Chris, you're on Opie and Anthony.  Hey, Chris, what do you got?  Chris, you on?  All right.  He said that the bus made a wrong turn.  He just saw it happen.  Not to head away from Paramus.  Norton's crashing a wheel.  He just wants to go home. 
[00:44:00]  Hey, Sean.  Sean, you're on ONA, Sean.  Yeah.  You there?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's blocked.  Both ways go on to Paramus for 10 miles each way.  I'm sitting here.  I've tried the parkway.  The parkway is no picnic.  I'm never getting there ever.  What's the problem?  A bunch of wilds.  There's like a fleet of them.  It's disgusting.  All right.  So it's just a parking lot now.  Everyone has just come to a dead stop.  Pretty much, yeah.  Somewhere at the beginning of that.  And the scary thing is it's all guys, so nobody's getting loud, really. 
[00:44:30]  Yeah.  Okay.  Thank you.  You guys are.  Here's Jeff.  Jeff is out on the road there.  So what's happening, buddy?  Jeff.  Hey, Jeff.  Hey, what's up, guys?  I just passed the bus, and I passed all the traffic that it took into, and it's probably  going to take it another hour to get this to the Pulaski Skyway.  What is the problem?  I don't know.  There's just cars everywhere.  There's cars surrounding the bus.  It's just the regular traffic, I guess, for Friday, but it sucks.  Is it moving at all?  No, it's not moving at all.  It's all the way up the way they're going, all the way out to the Pulaski, so they're going 
[00:45:00]  to be there for a while.  All right.  And everyone who's out there, you know, the bus does have beer.  Oh, no.  Wait a minute.  No, no.  Don't let them start rocking the bus.  Here's a Jersey City cop.  He's going to help out a little bit.  Oh, okay.  And he's just calling himself a Jersey City cop.  How you doing, sir?  I'm here.  How you doing?  Welcome to the O.P. and Anthony Show.  All right, guys.  I was listening to the show.  If they're going towards the Skyway, they better not get on the Skyway because that is  the wrong way for Paramus.  It is. 
[00:45:30]  It is.  We need you to take over here.  I can, man.  I'm in the middle of something.  That's why I can't really, I can give you some directions for them if you've got anywhere  to hook me up.  Can you radio an escort to them?  Yes.  That's what we really need is an escort.  I don't think I could get fired for that.  Yeah, the last time that worked out so well.  Yeah, right?  Every time we go on escort, it's a nice thing.  They got to get on the, they got to get on one and nine north through three to 17.  They don't want to go near the Skyway.  All right.  Thank you later.  All right. 
[00:46:00]  You're on the bus and you're listening.  The Jersey City cop says you don't want to go near the Skyway.  All right.  Now look who's on the phone, Fuzzy.  It's the Panther boy, Richard Voss.  Hey, what's happening?  Hey, Mitch.  Who says you guys don't get big acts calling in?  Oh, geez.  We haven't actually talked to you in forever.  I know.  I know.  You got my present, though.  Yeah, I know.  I did.  I talked to you, but it was very nice.  You like it?  Yeah.  How come you're not on the bus today?  How come it's always Norton?  Well, you know what?  Because we didn't invite you, Voss. 
[00:46:30]  All right.  Hold on.  What's going on?  What?  Rick says you didn't get invited.  Who said that, Rick?  Yeah.  Oh, you got him?  Yeah.  That would be one of the reasons I'm not on.  That's right.  What's the heat between you guys?  He's always importing girls from other countries.  He's starting fights with our newer guests, like Frank Caliendo.  First of all, Frank loved me, and it was great radio.  And what the heck?  If he's going to hang with the big boys, he's going to do it.  He's a comic.  He can't take a joke.  You know.  And the girl from Holland was great. 
[00:47:00]  She brought me some more cigars.  All right.  So is there a little he here?  Rich has a little problem with his show?  No.  Nah.  He's just looking for extra air time since...  What are you talking about?  I'm not looking for any air time.  When I come on the show, I never plug, okay?  I'm going by Bananas and Hasbro Heights tonight where I'm working.  I never plug.  Right.  And there's nothing but good radio when Rich Voss comes in.  Richard, I feel very uncomfortable being stuck in this situation. 
[00:47:30]  Where is Rick?  Is he on the bus?  Yeah.  I mean, all I'm supposed to be doing is watching their house and their pool,  and they said you couldn't go in, and it's not up to me.  Yeah.  If it was up to me, I'd have you in, swimming around, having a great time.  No, no.  It's Rick.  He's coming at me.  That's okay.  I can handle it.  You know, Voss, you know I love you.  I know.  I can handle it.  What are you kidding me?  The reason I'm not on the bus is because, you know, Earl's got the best.  Oh, Rick!  Rick!  Rick leans over and cuts off Richard Voss. 
[00:48:00]  Cuts off the Panther boys.  All right, that's heat.  But, you know, any time you have to say, no, it was good radio.  Any time you have to explain that.  It usually wasn't.  Well, Rick knows I love him.  That's why.  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  All right.  I hope so.  I'm up on him.  What's going on the rest of the show now?  You're playing some best of stuff?  Yeah, as soon as you guys decide you want to take off, you can't take working for free any longer.  Sure, I'll just drop in some best of bits for the guys, and the guys will be checking in from the next traffic camp.  If we only want to know, if we only want to know, we went to seven. 
[00:48:30]  Yeah.  This is great.  This is everything we've dreamed of.  Hey, it's the incredible planning here today, don't you?  True.  All right.  Well, we'll take a break.  When we come back, some of the O&A best of stuff.  Yep.  So continue the WOW road trip, jump the shark tour.  Oh, no.  Rick?  No, that is not a good thing.  That ain't right.  Right now, they're stuck in traffic, fuzzy, but the next stop, Paramus, Garden State Plads. 
[00:49:00]  I know we talked to some people that are already waiting.  They are on their way, but they're just absolutely stuck.  It's gridlock.  Right.  And before you guys go, I know on behalf of the guys and everybody on the show, thanks for hanging out for the extra hour if you could.  Oh, no.  Stop it.  Stop it.  It helps us out, the listeners out.  Stop it.  I remember when you used to talk this night to Richard Voss.  Yeah.  Yeah, just wait until next week, Brian.  All right.  More on the WOW road trip coming up on Opie and Anthony.  What country are you from? 
[00:49:30]  What?  What ain't no country I ever heard of.  It's the English and what?  What?  English, mother f***er, do you?  Jesus.  Yeah.  Then you know what I'm saying.  Uh, what?  Say what again.  Say what again.  I dare you.  I don't dare you, mother f***er.  Say what.  One more.  Say okay.  Uh, okay.  What?  Yeah, yeah.  Destroy, destroy.  Butt munch?  Opie and Anthony, 1027, WNEW.  Hour, hour, hour, hour. 
[00:50:00]  By Opie and Anthony.  Surfing New Jersey, Connecticut, Long Island.  This is 1027, WNEW, New York.  Hey, what's up?  This is Gino.  And this is Richard.  And we're from the band Filter.  And you're listening to our friends Opie and Anthony on 1027, WNEW.  Nice.  I think we're live on the air.  It's Opie and Anthony.  We are doing the WOW road trip.  We're on our way to Paramus.  I believe we're about 20 to 30 minutes away. 
[00:50:30]  You mother effers better not leave Paramus if you're listening to us in your car.  We'll be there expecting a big crowd.  We have lots of stuff to give away.  And please hang out and be patient.  We're stuck in traffic, but we're figuring this out as we go.  I don't even know if we're on the air because the phone sounds like it's crapping out.  But, Rick, how do we sound?  Actually, you sound pretty good.  Oh, good.  Okay, thank you.  A couple things, guys.  The Whistler Bikini Contest continues. 
[00:51:00]  We are down to the four finalists.  We have still in the contest Kelly, Celia, Amelisa, and Jesse.  Wow, I think he likes the Amelisa.  And we need all the faithful listeners to vote every day.  We're going to announce the winner for that trip to Hawaii on Monday  when we're back in the studio.  So, please, during the weekend, make sure you get your favorite girl  in the Whistler Bikini Contest.  I just want to remind people again that tomorrow night I'm hanging with my buddy,  my pal, Brother Reed. 
[00:51:30]  He's doing his Saturday night show live from the WNW studio.  So, we're going to be doing a little radio tomorrow night as well.  Anthony, you got a few things, Ben, as we head to Paramus?  First of all, I want to thank everybody, the listeners, Ron and Flowsfire.  You know, doing that, what they did, taking over on the slot.  Hey, Mad Max, you there?  Mad Max, hello?  You don't play the silent game with me, Rick.  Rick, just talk in your normal voice. 
[00:52:00]  I don't understand why you put the Universal Studios.  It's not really the Cleaver House.  It's what we call a facade.  Rick, I know you're there.  Don't screw with me.  Don't make me curse again.  And the other very important thing, first of all, Stinky has been, people have started  asking him if he's okay.  This is a fair thing to do.  And someone bring a bottle of vodka to Paramus, which is the fence of weed, Stinky. 
[00:52:30]  I don't think I'm on.  But if I am, I'm a professional, so I can pin you.  Hey, Rick, we're still on.  Just let me know, because it's really hard to hear you.  No, you're definitely on.  We're on?  Yep.  Okay.  Also, Rick, maybe you can take a few calls from the faithful listeners and find out where  everyone is kind of hanging out in Paramus so we can hit one nice location when we get  there, okay?  In that mall.  Also, Jim Norton's on the bus. 
[00:53:00]  Jim, come on back here.  All right.  No, that is it.  We're going to do a best show bit in a second, a quick one.  I think we're doing the...  I really don't have any observations.  I'm eating a burger, and I was just talking to the best contest winner.  Now I have to...  We're losing you, guys.  What's that?  We're losing you. 
[00:53:30]  No, I can still hear you, so you couldn't be looking here.  I feel like I'm trying to get you.  Did they mention at the last stop there was a truncated lady?  Did they mention that?  Did they happen?  I don't know.  No arms or legs.  I wanted to throw her on the bus and bang her in the bathroom.  She had a flipper leg.  Oh, she had a flipper leg.  Good.  So I could have thrown her in the toilet.  She could have slammed for a little while.  At least I'm not doing racial humor.  My phone is ringing.  I don't know.  My phone is ringing. 
[00:54:00]  Hello?  How did they not happen?  Did the phone hang up, Rick?  No, you guys are still there.  We're still on the radio.  They're still on the air.  All right.  Please, once again, if you guys are in for a minute, don't blow us off.  We'll get there as soon as possible, okay?  It seems like the traffic is definitely moving again.  Do you want to play a best of it, Anthony?  Yeah.  All right.  We're going to play a quick best of it, and we'll be back right after the Titan migration  bid on WNW.  Thanks, guys. 
[00:54:30]  Like it or not, this will be the most popular radio show in New York City.  The O&A show beats the hell out of my dad's old pornos.  The O&A show, 212-757-1027 is our phone number.  Well, Anthony, we've got to get into Mike Tyson.  Well, you could get into Mike Tyson.  I'll get into you without any lube. 
[00:55:00]  This guy is downright scary.  He's a madman.  He is an insane madman.  And they know it.  Like they keep him all doped up until he's got a fight.  Well, what have you taken?  He's taken like Zoloft or something.  That melds out pretty good.  And, you know, a couple weeks leading up to the fight or a week leading up to the fight,  they take him off the stuff, so he's a lunatic in the ring.  Yeah.  So he'll kill you.  So he's fighting Andrew Gulotta, who's just a big scumbag 
[00:55:30]  and deserves whatever tights he can throw at him.  Gulotta?  One of the dirtiest fighters in the history of boxing, Rick.  Oh, yeah.  Up against such an upstanding guy.  No, I understand that.  That's why this is going to be a pretty good fight.  Yeah.  Gulotta likes to hit guys in the ballies.  That's his whole move.  He's wrecked his whole career by hitting guys in the ballies when he's winning fights.  So he's just as psychotic as Tyson.  Yeah, he's kind of insane. 
[00:56:00]  He's like a blockhead.  But no one beats the Tyson.  Anyway, we got some Tyson audio.  Yeah.  And I don't know what he's trying to say.  Maybe someone could figure it out.  He doesn't have his mental faculties anymore.  I don't know if he ever did.  Like, he's just, he's crazy.  Listen to some of this stuff.  How is this going to end with Tyson?  I don't know.  I feel he'll have to be destroyed.  That's what I'm thinking. 
[00:56:30]  He'll break a leg.  Yeah.  Destroyed?  He'll break a leg and put him out to stut or something.  I don't know.  But I'm thinking he'll have to be destroyed.  Do you think we could revert back to a movie to explain your point a little better?  When you talk about being destroyed?  Let me think.  I could revert to King Kong, where he was on the, he was on the, I just saw it the other  day, the original.  All right, you're right.  When he got to New York, it was unfamiliar surroundings for Kong, you know, and it kind 
[00:57:00]  of freaked him out.  And, you know, women freak Kong out.  And he wound up climbing up the Empire State Building, and they had to send the planes  in and destroy him.  And that's what I'm saying is going to have to happen to Mike Tyson.  So if I follow you here, you think eventually that Tyson's going to climb the Empire State  Building, there's going to be helicopters around in planes, and that's going to be his  demise.  No, it's more figuratively I'm saying it, not literally. 
[00:57:30]  It could be the World Trade Center.  Would they be a white woman in the world?  They could be.  Yes, yes.  Oh, this is a great bit.  What I'm saying is, you know, somebody as angry as Mike Tyson, I could equate his situation  to any movie.  I could revert to a lot of movies.  Yeah.  One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, but King Kong just popped in my head.  What I'm saying is just an angry guy like that.  And, sorry, a lot of guys reverting to other movies. 
[00:58:00]  You might not have hit the movie on the head.  All right.  Let's try to see what people are reverting to.  Rich is reverting to a movie.  Hey, guys, I have the perfect movie, Old Yeller.  Old Yeller.  And at the end, he gets rabies, he goes nuts, and they've got to shoot him.  There you go.  Mike Tyson is like Old Yeller with rabies.  Because he's starting kind of, like, normal in a way.  Yeah, everybody likes him in the beginning.  As far as fighters go.  Oh, Mike Tyson.  Yeah.  He's yellow.  And then at the end, they've just got to shoot him because he's nuts.  And thanks, Rich, you bastard. 
[00:58:30]  I never saw that movie.  I was going to rent it tomorrow.  You just ruined the ending of Old Yeller for me, you son of a bitch.  Thank you, Rich.  All right.  That's pretty funny, though.  I heard Bruce Willis was dead during the entire movie, Old Yeller.  Ah, Chris, what's up?  Yeah, George.  Why is this?  He's going around fighting people, and you just shoot them at the end.  Oh, okay.  He's fighting people.  Oh, man.  I can't.  You didn't pick on anything.  You didn't pick up on that one right away.  I didn't know which part of Jaws you were referring to, but that makes perfect sense.  He bites people, so he ought to stick some compressed air in his mouth and shoot it with a rifle. 
[00:59:00]  That would be it.  Yeah, that's all.  All right.  Chris, you're next on NEW.  I think Star Wars.  Star Wars.  You're starting to do a pilot's eye on time and watch his head explode.  The man's in a giant death star.  Remember the last audio they talked about?  He said, eat a Vanderholyfield's children.  Yeah.  Eat a Vanderholyfield's children.  He goes, I'm going to eat your children.  The man's crazy.  I don't know.  I'm thinking more, you know, things like Old Yeller.  Yeah.  King Kong.  Mighty Joe Young. 
[00:59:30]  Like that.  You know, in that vein.  Look at me.  Look at me.  I've been embarrassed.  Humiliation, degradation, and any other T.I.O.N.  you can name that's negative, right?  But listen, and you're going to ask me why I'm angry, why I'm like this?  And all of a sudden, I look back and retrospective and say, oh, man, I've been devastated.  And the only thing you can say is that I'm paid, I'm rich, and my life and soul's been tore apart.  I love you, too. 
[01:00:00]  What the hell did he just say?  I think Muhammad Ali makes more sense.  Holy Lord.  Decon fog on.  Decon fog on.  Someone reverting to the movie, The Fly, with the Brundle Fly ripping the guy's arm off when arm wrestling.  Yeah.  See?  That's a perfect example.  Let's try to go back to the audio, all right, Anthony?  Well, it's pervasive that I'm typically an animal, so I really think, you know, they're so pervasive, they really believe that. 
[01:00:30]  So I guess they only enjoy me being an animal in the ring, because I'm sure there are nine million people that watch me probably hate my dress.  Most of them are probably white.  But listen, right?  But it's cool, though, right?  Because I don't know.  I probably hate them, too.  Okay, terrific.  Here's one where Tyson loses his train of thought.  I feel uncomfortable with the fact that he's not here.  I can't say it in his face.  Yeah, he's going to feel some pain.  I know probably he's mad if I ain't going to wait on him. 
[01:01:00]  I wouldn't know waiting game.  But, oh, God, this is beautiful.  It's a good day today, you know.  But listen, right?  Go ahead, man.  Go ahead.  What?  Wow.  What was that?  All right.  Okay, terrific.  What else is there to say on that one?  He's just a nut.  That is another, like, life form that is just able to speak English.  Like, that's another type of mammal on this planet that just happens to speak some, what? 
[01:01:30]  A little bit of English.  Just a piece of English.  Like, if you walked up to a dog and said hello and it went, hello, it's like the same thing.  The guy is crazy.  Tyson talking about Zoloft.  The drug that he's on, until he has to fight, they take him off it so he can be a lunatic in the ring.  I'm on the Zoloft thing, right?  But I'm on that to keep me from killing y'all. 
[01:02:00]  Oh, my God.  Zoloft is the cage.  Is the virtual cage that this guy is in.  He takes it to keep from killing y'all.  Y'all.  He just threatened the world.  Right.  Like, he's taking that and pretty much threatened the world from killing y'all.  He just challenged the world.  He's like Godzilla.  He could just come out of Tokyo Bay and just destroy cities off of this Zoloft. 
[01:02:30]  Thank God for Zoloft.  Who invented that?  Give him a medal.  He saved the world.  He saved humanity.  Imagine that.  A true American hero.  Absolutely.  I don't think enough credit has been given to the Zoloft creator.  He saved humanity from the likes of Mike Tyson trying to kill y'all.  I cannot classify him as a human being.  He's going to kill somebody. 
[01:03:00]  He is.  It's just a matter of time.  I've gotten taken off the Zoloft.  Yeah, I got to hear that one again.  Yeah.  To keep from killing y'all.  I'm on the Zoloft thing, right?  But I'm on that to keep me from killing y'all.  Here's Mike off the Zoloft.  There he is, turning up her jeeps.  Fighting through the floor of jeeps to try to get small children.  Come on out of there. 
[01:03:30]  I'm off the Zoloft.  Come here.  Look at the kids in the jeeps.  Aren't they cute little white children?  I'm going to bite this tire.  Don't shine that light in my pupils.  And I think we have audio of Mike Tyson singing.  Tyson singing.  Yeah.  Yeah, Mike.  Woo. 
[01:04:00]  I'm on the Zoloft thing, right?  But I'm on that to keep me from killing y'all. 
[01:04:30]  I'm on that to keep me from killing y'all. 
[01:05:00]  Up in there, y'all gon' make me go on out.  Up in there, up in there, y'all gon' make me actin' cool.  Up in there, up in there, y'all gon' make me do my good.  Up in there, up in there, off the train, I leave the track and break.  That's the sickest sound ever.  I eat kids, people, dogs, I don't care. 
[01:05:30]  Mothers and their babies, I will eat everybody.  Y'all gon' make me lose my mind.  Mike has a translation on line 11.  Mike, what's up?  Yeah, I think he was trying to talk about how much he loved his family and he hates the white people.  I mean, I gotta revert back to Jurassic Park 2, Lost World.  We should crank his ass up and send him back out to the island.  The only way we're gonna be safe.  All right.  Yeah, make the island and crank his ass up.  I gotta get back to Skull Island. 
[01:06:00]  Thank you, Mike.  Somebody was mad at me for giving the ending to King Kong.  PC from Staten Island writes,  ONA, does Tyson take pills of Zoloft or is he giving it with a tranquilizer gun?  Look at that bugger.  Does someone have to tell him that he's gotta go back on the Zoloft after the fight?  I don't think he's doing it on his own.  Yeah, really.  Imagine that.  Here, take this, Mike.  What you trying to give me, poison?  Because he says, like, his trainers and stuff take him off the Zoloft, so they're taking the pills away. 
[01:06:30]  Who's the brave soul that has to tell him, well, all right, Mike, fight's over.  I'm probably just injected in the big piece of raw meat they throw into his cage after the fight.  Flop.  Oh, I feel better.  Okay, let me out.  Hey, Rob, what's up?  Hey, what's happening?  You guys can't possibly think that's a good drug.  Anthony, okay, that's the greatest drug.  Someone goes off it, they kill people.  Really?  Free Hartman killed Phil Hartman when she went off the Zoloft.  Man, if she was, like, a quiet little girl. 
[01:07:00]  Imagine what Tyson could do off the drug.  That's what I'm saying.  He's true.  He will kill us all.  I think he's a military experiment.  They're giving him the Zoloft, and then if we ever get into war with someone, they take him off and parachute him in behind enemy lines, and he just tears up the cities.  It would work well for us.  He's like Gorgo.  Gorgo.  Remember Gorgo?  Oh, my God.  The Godzilla ripoff.  Remember that?  Gorgo with the little thin ears and everything. 
[01:07:30]  I forgot all about Gorgo.  He's Gorgo.  You're the mellowest creature in the world.  You're like a tame rabbit.  And they take Tyson off of it to fight.  That's what I'm saying.  It should be illegal.  I thought I could bring a gun into the ring.  There should be a huge fence around the ring so it doesn't hurt the spectators.  A cage match.  Only the audience is in the cage.  Right.  Come on out, you pussies.  I'll chew right through that chain link.  Hey, Mr. Tyson.  Yeah?  While we have you in the studio, how do you spell Zoloft? 
[01:08:00]  Zoloft.  R-O-L-A-I-D-S.  I don't know.  How do you spell it?  I don't know, but you better give me some quick.  Why do I have this tag in my ear?  I woke up with a tag in my ear with a number and a radio transmitter on my back.  I think that is to track my migration habits.  They want to know where Mike goes in between fights.  I like in the warm weather, I go north, and in the cold weather, I go south. 
[01:08:30]  And they track me with my little antenna on my back.  But sometimes I rub against a tree and dislodge it, and they have to tranquilize me and put a new transmitter on my back.  That's when I need more Zoloft.  You ever see him do that on the Wild Kingdom show with the bear?  They give him the tranquilizer, and all of a sudden his lip gets all loopy and his tongue sticks out of his mouth? 
[01:09:00]  You ought to see when the Mike Tyson looks like that.  They had to pull me out of a cave once with a come-along, and they measured me and pulled one of my tufas out to see how old I was.  Then they woke me up, and you should have saw them bastards run when I started coming, too.  They ran for the hills. 
[01:09:30]  They was petrified.  I'm on the Zoloft thing, right?  But I'm on that to keep me from killing y'all.  You better give me more.  I remember once I was looking for food at the local dump, and it was dangerous for the children, so they put me in a cage on the back of a pickup truck and relocated me.  But I kept coming back, because that was some tasty-ass garbage. 
[01:10:00]  You can't keep me away from a good old Swanson TV dinner half-eaten thing at the dump.  I love that S.  I got one for you.  Yeah.  You think that crocodile hunter has balls?  Give him some Zoloft and have him wrestle with Tyson.  Give him the Zoloft and calm him down.  Then I would be impressed. 
[01:10:30]  Screw those goddamn alligators.  Crocodiles are pussies.  Right.  They can't even punch.  Damn crocodile hunter.  Let's see if you take care of Tyson.  Get some Zoloft in him.  See, the funny thing about the Tyson jaw is its power isn't in opening.  It's in closing.  So you can actually hold it shut with your bare hands, but don't let it open, because I'll take your fingers off.  Fingers off, Zoloft, whatever. 
[01:11:00]  Come here, you little wasn't dancing.  He's ready to go into a death fight.  He's coming into a death row.  All right.  I'm reverting myself to Hannibal Lecter.  I need like a muzzle or something.  Some Zoloft.  Let's take a break.  All right. 
[01:11:30]  All afternoon, Opie and Anthony's WOW Road Trip on WNEW.  Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello.  Rick, I don't even know if I'm on the air.  You're on.  You're on.  I'm on, Rick?  Yeah.  All right.  It's Opie and Anthony.  We are in the WOW spot doing this road trip thing.  We're going about 10 miles now. 
[01:12:00]  We're heading towards Paramus.  Kind of a nightmare, but we're hoping for a really big crowd when we finally get to Paramus.  So you guys, it's not too late if you're in the Paramus area to join us.  What is the official location, Ben, in Paramus?  What's the name of the mall?  Garden State Plaza.  Okay.  We're trying to figure out exactly where we're going to be in the Garden State Plaza.  But we'll figure it out when we get closer.  Hey, Opie.  Yeah.  Opie, I got a couple suggestions.  People calling in, you wanted me to find out a good place to go in that mall area? 
[01:12:30]  Yeah.  They said between the Wiz and Macy's there's a lot of space.  Okay.  Let's do that then.  Between the Wiz and Macy's.  That'll be perfect.  We should be there hopefully in about 20 minutes.  Okay.  We're running really, really late.  We know that.  But please come on out and hang with us for a while.  It's going to be a fine time when we finally, finally get there.  In the meantime, we're going to be playing some of our best of material and giving you some live updates from the plot.  I can tell you one thing.  Stinky is in heaven. 
[01:13:00]  Woo!  Stinky is blasting.  Here's Anthony.  Yes.  Stinky has learned, like a Jedi Knight, has learned how to pour the beer out of a keg without phone.  So now everyone's asking Stinky to pour their beer.  It's a wonderful thing.  It's an education.  And Ann, you guys are drinking what, Sam Adams?  Sam Adams.  Two kegs.  This is ridiculous.  And he's learned this in the first day? 
[01:13:30]  Yeah.  Jim Cook would be proud.  Well, Ben goes for more of the just crank, pump the hell out of the keg, and then smash the tap down and have it, like, spew out as quickly as possible.  I said, no.  No, grasshopper.  What you do is you barely crack the tap and it trickles out.  Our patients will have a full beer.  That's exactly what we're doing.  And we're looking forward to us getting to Paramus. 
[01:14:00]  Yes.  Oh, Opie, yeah, yeah.  Well, they're telling us we've got to, like, go to commercials, so we'll be back.  I can't believe we're getting paid to do this today.  This is really, like Ron has said, a complete disaster.  I mean, we're not kidding anyone at this point.  It sounded good on paper, but, I don't know, we're looking forward to seeing some of those things.  Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you for helping us out today.  We're going to some commercials, but we're going to attempt a live read, like we're in the studio in a couple minutes. 
[01:14:30]  We'll stay there.  Anicle Horn and Goatweed is the official sponsor of today's Wild Caravan.  I wanted to help me tag you.  Hope, you're on.  All right, thank you, Rick.  We're back on the bus, and it's time for a live read.  Thank you, John, it's mine.  Okay, look what I do.  Hey, Anthony, Stadium Auto Mall.  Yes, Sophie, Stadium Auto Mall. 
[01:15:00]  All you need to buy a new car truck is a 10.  You don't need money.  There's no down payment, no security deposit, no payment until 2002.  Huge from over 10 acres, a brand-new Ford, Jeep, Chrysler, even new cars and trucks.  But please, leave your money at home.  No payment until 2002.  Don't worry about that, Fred.  Stadium Auto Mall finances every, everyone.  Or Stadium will pay you $1,000 cash. 
[01:15:30]  Why wait until next year to get the car truck or SUV you want?  Stadium Auto Mall, if you buy now, pay later, much later, like 2002 later.  Stinky, no security deposit, no payments until 2002, and guaranteed financing for everyone, even Stinky.  Only at the incredible Stadium Auto Mall, Route 17, North Rutherford, New Jersey. 
[01:16:00]  Call them up right now, 201-935-2400, 201-935-2400 for Stadium Auto Mall.  Keep the 14-year-old away from us.  Have a drink.  I want to bang you.  Can I hear this on Z100?  Have a drink.  I want to bang you.  This is normal radio, right?  Okay.  Okay.  You're on. 
[01:16:30]  Yes, it's Friday.  Look at us.  We are stuck in traffic.  Woo!  We are now telling us, Anthony, we're less than 15 miles away from our location in Paramus.  Very excited.  Yes, yes. 
[01:17:00]  It should be 15 miles, you said?  So we should be there by 8, which is good.  No, we're moving now.  We should be there between 5 and 5.30.  I'd say there's a state set.  5 and 5.15.  I hope you're saying that.  And speaking, we are having so much fun in the bus with Stinky.  Woo!  And Stinky, how many, first of all, how many ice-cold Sam Adams have you poured?  That's 60, 70, you know, 70, because he's pouring for everyone, because he knows the way 
[01:17:30]  of the town.  He has learned like a Jedi master.  He's mad at the port.  He does it.  You don't crank down on the town.  Now, I also think, as you spit up the drink, he just, I swear, he just spit drink all over  the BNF.  He's so effort excited.  He's got two cans in front of him.  He's just paid for this.  And he's just trying to stuff.  Now he's just still doing it all over his drive.  He's all went.  It looks like he's quickly thinking, how do you feel about this job? 
[01:18:00]  Oh, it's the greatest job ever.  Now, what, describe for the people your surroundings right now.  I'm in front of two kegs and two bottles of vodka and Red Bull, and we're having a great  time.  And are you discouraged from drinking because there are some management people on board?  I have no care at all.  He has no care.  No one doesn't ever care.  He hasn't focused those eyes at night.  What are you staring at, DeProy? 
[01:18:30]  I haven't seen Jeremy in about two hours.  Where is he?  Yeah, Jeremy left the bus.  He bailed.  Now, Stinky, what are you drinking now?  Red Bull and vodka.  Red Bull is an energy drink.  It's like a boost you.  And vodka, of course, we know what that is.  It's a poor man's speedball.  You steal the offer from the Red Bull, yet you get the buzz from the vodka.  And Stinky is imploring people, please, bring vodka to Paramus, because he needs it. 
[01:19:00]  Also on the bus, Anthony, we got Jim Norm, who was taking a little cat nap, and it was  a little scary.  He was making all sorts of weird faces and stuff while he was sleeping.  Yes, sir?  Well, did you see when he woke up?  It was when I teabagged his nose.  And he loved it.  Jim?  Yeah, it was nice.  I was dreaming about onions, and then I woke up, and Stinky is drunk and retarded.  And Billy Mack was like William Holden two minutes before he hit the coffee table. 
[01:19:30]  And so the Parkway was a really brilliant idea.  I think we would have got their fanfare if we got that.  Are we still on the air?  Can you guys hear?  Yeah, you're still on.  We're still on the air, Jim.  All right, Steve from FoundryMusic.com.  Steve knows this area.  Where the hell are we?  We are at exit 145 on the Parkway North, stuck in some serious traffic. 
[01:20:00]  And, yes, Anthony?  Steve, what do you have in your hand right now?  Many drinks.  One of which I was apparently not supposed to shake.  And I'm about to open it.  I was like, Steve, apparently I'm not supposed to shake the record before opening it.  And one is about a triple shot of vodka.  So, all right.  So, obviously, we're slowly but surely making our way to Paramus. 
[01:20:30]  Pandemonium.  Pandemonium on the fine wow bus.  For all you people on Long Island, we will make it to the Dublin pub.  For you people in Yonkers, we might have a little problem with that.  All right, look.  People in Yonkers, we really appreciate the effort for those of you that came out to meet the bus for the wow tour that we're doing today.  But we're going to have to cut the route short to make it to the Dublin pub on Long Island. 
[01:21:00]  Now, I understand some people are upset.  One of those people are not stinky.  You couldn't upset this guy if you put a meat cleaver over his head.  But we're going to have to reroute ourselves to get to Long Island.  And that means bypassing Yonkers.  Opie?  That's great.  We've got to get Ben on the air because he thinks it's just hilarious that Sticky is completely hammered on his butt.  Sticky is in the rarest of forms.  He will cheer anything. 
[01:21:30]  That's all I can say.  This is a long trip.  I think he will cheer anything.  Ben is, like, completely proud that Sticky is taking this one.  I think Ben's a little upset because everyone he would have called when he's drunk is here.  So it's kind of a problem for him.  He doesn't know who to call.  Opie?  All right.  So I guess we're going to take another break.  You've got to catch up with commercials, I believe. 
[01:22:00]  Yeah, Sticky.  He's excited about the commercials.  He can't breathe.  He'll laugh at the car because he's probably going to sit home.  But guys, please, the Whistler and Bikini Contest continues.  We've got to vote every day.  We're down to four girls on Monday.  First thing during Monday's show, we'll announce the grand prize winner for that trip to Hawaii.  We're down to, I believe, Kelly, Jesse, Celia, and Emma Lisa.  So go to your favorite girl on Monday.  That's F-O-U-N-G-R-Y music.com. 
[01:22:30]  That's F-O-U-N-G-R-Y music.com.  Also, really fast, my buddy, my Kyle, brother, we've been coming to town.  He's doing a show live tomorrow night from the WNW studios, and I'm going to be hanging and doing the show with him.  That should be a lot of fun to listen to as well.  So I don't think we have time to play the hot wax chill bit.  We might do it after commercials.  It's really up to Rick at this point.  Rick, take this away, and we'll see you in a little bit.  Hey, I'm going to play a little old Bill out of the archives.  All right, cool.  All right?  Yeah, hit it. 
[01:23:00]  Opie and Adler.  Hi, we're here.  We're here under your skin.  I'm doing A-hole.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello, sir.  I'm an elderly gentleman, and I need a motor.  A motorized scooter.  They call my name's Bill.  What's your name, sir?  They call my name's Bill.  Bill?  Yes.  Have you seen any particular type that you like?  I like the little rascal.  The rascal?  I saw that on the TV. 
[01:23:30]  I'm a little rascal in my little rascal.  Uh-huh.  Is what the woman said.  That's what the woman said, huh?  And she's getting around.  She's shopping and eating ice cream.  How fast does it go, sir?  Uh, the fastest is about five miles an hour.  I flew a P-51 Mustang in the big one.  Yeah, it won't go that fast.  Oh, it won't?  No.  I need, uh, also a room in the back for an oxygen tank.  Uh-huh.  Because I'm on oxygen.  Oh, I see.  And it's got to have good suspension because I don't want my colostomy bag dislodging. 
[01:24:00]  No, you don't want that either.  No.  Yeah.  The bigger machines will have like a spring suspension in the front.  Oh, boy.  My friend Petey's got one and it's a real chick magnet.  Yeah?  He goes around at the bingo game and he gives the girls rides on the back.  Can I get a two-seater?  No, you can't get a two-seater.  But I can't be jostled around too much.  I've got a prostate like a porcupine.  Yeah, I see.  Yeah, that's kind of tough.  You can stop by our showroom. 
[01:24:30]  We have three or four models on the floor and we get them in.  Excuse me, sir.  How the hell am I supposed to get there?  You're not driving anymore?  No.  I drove in a lake and they took my car away.  Oh, I see.  Can I take one of these like on major highways?  No, you cannot.  Because my grandson lives far away and I like to play some ball with him.  No, you can't do that, no.  I can't?  No.  The furthest tail goes about 24, 25 miles.  Is that the furthest range?  Yeah, and they go about five miles an hour.  So you'd be kind of lost on the highway, don't you think? 
[01:25:00]  I don't have much.  I have nothing else to do.  What else am I going to do with my time?  If it takes me two hours to get ten miles, I don't care.  Also, I lost my arm in the big one.  Oh, you did?  Do you have any kind of catapults that I could play ball with my grandson?  Like a pitching arm or something?  No, no.  They call my name Bill.  Could you just come over and shoot me in the head?  No.  I mean, hell, I was big once.  I was in the war.  I was a commander.  And now I got to drive on a three-wheel battery-powered scooter? 
[01:25:30]  Yeah, that's sad.  This is degrading.  It is degrading.  Sam, could you just shoot me?  Could you take a goddamn gun and shoot me in the freaking head?  No, I don't think so.  Please, I'll come down.  Put my head under the wheel of one of the scooters and hit go.  I don't think it would do anything.  Could you do that to me, Bernie?  They just hit me in the brainstem with a ball-peen hammer stem.  Could you do that?  No, no.  I mean, hell, I haven't been laid since the Kaiser was in Germany, for Christ's sake. 
[01:26:00]  I have big baloney breasts.  I haven't seen a naked woman in 42 years.  That's a long time.  You know what that's like?  My pants are up to my nipples and I'm calling them for a scooter.  What's your last name, Bill?  I have a wraparound eyeglasses that I look like the freaking Terminator, Sam.  I've lived for 85 years. 
[01:26:30]  It's enough already, for Christ's sake.  Kill me.  Could someone just kill me?  My name's Bill.  They call my name's Bill.  Oh, Jesus.  My teeth just fell out.  My freaking teeth.  I spit my teeth out of my head.  Oh.  Kill me.  Somebody just kill me, for Christ's sake.  Oh, he, he, he.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.

[01:30:00]  Crap, whiz, and vomit.  1-0-2-7-W-N-E-W.  Hi, Anthony.  I believe we are live once again from the Wow Bus.  We just came out of a Vermont teddy bear library.  And, coincidentally, we have a bear counselor following the Wow Bus.  And, they're trying to board the bus to talk about the sticky drinking problem.  You know, we're not supposed to make affairs.  But, I think you can make your own up.  Around stinky. 
[01:30:30]  For vodka bear.  Kidding, of course.  Stinky, we're having fun today.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, that's great.  Well, we're on our way to Paramus.  It should be, minute-wise, how long are we talking?  5-10 minutes.  So, be there.  Actual locations, please.  Anyone?  Anyone?  Garden State Plaza.  What is that?  Between the Wiz and Macy in Paramus. 
[01:31:00]  That's where we're going to be.  5-10 minutes.  And, Opie, would you like to elaborate?  No, Anthony.  The guilt is starting to set in.  Gail!  This was the stupidest idea that we've ever come up with.  We're known for our wacky ideas.  We've come up with some creative radios and creative ideas.  But this is just a stupid thing to do, a disaster.  Well, I think the last thing that was planned as badly was the Iranian rescue from Jimmy Carter. 
[01:31:30]  Remember that one?  Dead people, three choppers in the desert blowing up.  This could be a close second.  Without a doubt.  But the point is, they thought it was the greatest idea.  You know why?  Because, well, we only have three weeks left on the contract.  So, we go to Jeremy and Ken, we're like, hey, we've got this great idea.  On a Friday, it's going to be 85 degrees.  The sun's going to be out.  We want to board a boss with two kegs of Sam Adams and drive around and meet all of our listeners in one afternoon. 
[01:32:00]  We're not going to say no to him, Anthony.  Oh, you want to go out and drink on the road and take a day off?  Sure, go ahead.  We love you guys.  We love you guys.  Anyway, but we're having fun.  Jim Norton is in the front of the bus.  He has, he has.  Oh, my God, he's driving.  He has conked out.  I don't know, but he's out of it.  He's unconscious, right?  All right, we're going to go back to another.  Oh, and it's Mother's Day right around the corner.  So, I believe this bit is where Anthony reflects on his ex-mother-in-law. 
[01:32:30]  My ex-mother-in-law.  So, enjoy this.  And by the end of this bit, we should be live from prime as well.  So, stay right there.  It's Opie and Anthony and the whole gang, really.  And I thought we'd do our really stupid, wow road trip.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  1027 WNEW. 
[01:33:00]  12-7-5-7-1027 Anthony.  Yes.  Why don't we go right to Uncle John and see what he has.  Uncle John, what's up?  Hey, guys.  I learned a couple of things tonight.  Yeah.  I learned not to invite Opie over for the weekend, if you might stay for a year and a half.  Yeah.  That's a good story.  That's your job.  My mother-in-law.  Cool.  Oh, my God, I did it twice.  Yeah.  We also learned...  Hold on, hold on.  We've got to back up a bit.  I forgot I did it at the point.  When we first went up to Boston, we were staying with my mother-in-law for, like, I stayed there a few weeks maybe. 
[01:33:30]  Barely.  Yeah.  Barely.  Maybe two weeks.  And moved right out.  Right.  Opie stayed there how long?  I'm gone.  I'm in my own place now.  And Opie and my mother-in-law living in the house for how long?  I lived with your mother-in-law for nine to ten months.  Nine to ten months.  Yeah.  I'm not trying to squeeze you for alimony?  The house just from hell. 
[01:34:00]  And he was breaking stuff.  Oh.  Like, you are terrible.  You broke this little...  Chotch.  No, I'm not as...  But I'm not as angry anymore, and I'm okay now.  I got it.  Like, you would just be clumsy.  Yeah.  You pulled the phone cord, and it hit this little figurine of her.  Her phone cord was 40 to 50 feet long, which is very dangerous in an older lady's house,  because they have all those trinkets around.  Oh, Jesus Christ, Rick.  Did you see her naked? 
[01:34:30]  Opie, I'm feeling a little lonely.  Get me the granoier and squash.  And get your ass over.  You did see her naked.  Oh, did you see her naked?  Oh, yeah, okay, yes.  I'll play along.  I saw Anthony's ex-mobile on naked.  Oh.  Of course I did.  Get me my squash.  I want to go home.  I want to go home.  But we're hanging out, and Jay's here, and Opie, and Sandy, and we're all, you know, 
[01:35:00]  hanging out.  We're in the restaurant, and it's very early, and we want to have...  I want to go home now.  I want to go home.  We'd make plans to go out, and I'm like, yeah, cool, we'll go out and stuff.  And then Jan would say, oh, let's take Mom.  I'm like, no, I don't...  I really...  You know, it's just us hanging out.  Fine.  Fine.  Fine.  Oh, my God. 
[01:35:30]  Why do we have to take Mom every time?  I just want to go out and hang out with everybody and have a good time, and now we've got to take Mom?  Fine.  You know, she doesn't ask for advice, and, you know, this happened, and this, and this,  and this, and a whole laundry list of crap, and there's a reason why we should take, you know,  something, fine, fine, we've got to leave right now.  I just want to go.  Thank you for taking me, Anthony.  Thank you for going out to dinner.  This is a lot of fun.  Yeah, okay, great.  An hour into it. 
[01:36:00]  I'll take another squash.  I'll take a squash.  Eh, eh, eh.  An hour and 15 minutes into it.  I want to go home.  Um, Jen, could you tell your Mom that we're still hanging?  I'm having fun.  I'm hanging out with Jay and Opie, and we're laughing our balls off and stuff.  I want to go home.  Okay, Opie, Jay, bye.  No, yeah, it was a lot of fun hanging out, but now I've got to take a drunken mother-in-law home. 
[01:36:30]  Woo-hoo!  Woo-hoo!  The best, though, is she would pass out on our buddy Jay's shoulder on the way home.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Pass out on poor Jay's shoulder.  Or lap.  She would.  Her head would be right in Jay's lap.  That's not even a joke.  She'd pass out.  Right.  She'd pass out right there.  I, uh, I want to go home.  Now we're having fun.  No, we weren't. 
[01:37:00]  Oh, my God.  Sorry, was I getting, uh, into something?  Well, who am I to say?  I'll be giving you up my cons.  I'll be touching my dirty spot.  You have gone too far.  You have gone too far.  I don't know how you did it.  I don't know how you'd stay there for that long. 
[01:37:30]  Doug, what's going on?  What's up, guys?  I hope was Anthony's ex-motherland the reason you sold your pants that night going into the bar?  That was years before I was...  Later, dude.  Have a good trip.  And then how about when the goddamn dog died?  Goddamn dog death dedication.  When the goddamn dog died and she put the ashes in the urn and put it up on the, in the living room.  Well, just like, uh, from Meet the Parents.  I was creeped out every time.  Here's the dead dog death. 
[01:38:00]  And when I die, I want my ashes put together with chestes and we're going to be buried together.  I want to go home.  I'm having fun.  I want to go home.  Oh, my, believe me.  It was like, you know, because I like to pace myself and have a good time, especially, let me tell you, especially when it's me, Opie, and Jay hanging out.  Because we would laugh so hard and come up with all this off-the-wall fun stuff. 
[01:38:30]  Worked great for the show.  And, um, I'd be just getting started.  I gotta go home now.  I gotta go home.  Son of a mother eff, bitch.  And there we were.  Going home.  At my 10-15.  Because you know why?  You know why?  You could email or call and say, you know, why not be a pussy and go.  Because if I didn't go home right then and there, it would just be worse.  It'd be worse. 
[01:39:00]  If mom didn't get to go, worse.  I'd listen.  I'd hear it all night from the ex.  All night.  Why couldn't mom go?  Ugh.  Jesus.  What, am I getting ahead of myself again?  Oh, what?  What, Opie?  No.  We ended our radio show hours ago, man.  It's just you and I in our office.  Opie, am I a leg smooth?  I just lost you. 
[01:39:30]  Oh, come on.  She was very nice to me.  Of course she was.  Yes.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Okay, if you don't want to talk to me anymore, that's fine.  We live here for nine months.  We meet you and Chester Dodgers.  And if you don't want to call me, fine.  I'm not going to chase you.  Come here, Chester.  Get the urn.  I'll pet me in until I die. 
[01:40:00]  And then we mix the ashes.  And me and Chester go about eternity together.  Okay, if you're in that effing bar.  If you're in that effing bar, I'm not going to chase you.  We had a great relationship.  You were living here for nine months.  Me, you're in Chester.  Come here, Chester.  Chester, I know you can't walk anymore.  I'll put you on wheels.  Say hi to Chester.  Chester walked just fine.  Chester, every, oh, my God. 
[01:40:30]  We had to eat there?  Come over.  I'm making turkey.  All right.  Coming over for dinner.  This dog was so effing spoiled, rotten.  You'd sit there.  And she didn't care.  The goddamn dog could jump up on the plate and start eating out of her plate.  And she'd be like, look at how cute Chester is.  And I'm sitting there like, if that dog comes near me, I swear to God, I am going to smack it in the nose.  And it would sit there.  This is what you get the entire time you're eating. 
[01:41:00]  Picture it.  Picture it the whole time.  But, Anthony, you're missing one sound.  But.  Oh, yeah.  And why did it make that sound?  That was when you kick it under the table because it's after your food.  You'd have to give it a smack.  Smack that, Chester.  And just the whole time. 
[01:41:30]  For an hour.  Anthony, if you're going to the fridge, could you get me a glass of wine out of the box?  Oh, the box.  The box wine is the best wine.  It's the cheapest.  Make me a Captain Morgan.  Captain, Captain McCook with a Chester of Lime and my box wine and some Squatch and some Grummy Egg.  And now I want to go home.  You are home.  Oh.  I want to go out.  I want to go out.  Unbelievable. 
[01:42:00]  Look, man.  I don't know this guy.  What?  What?  I just came in to do a radio.  What happened?  I don't want to recall this thing.  I'm able to unleash.  I can unleash.  I'm paying enough.  I should be able to talk about it.  That's right.  It's taking the knife out of the cheese.  You think you want some cheese, Chester?  Hey, Anthony, I got a little job for you.  When you come up, could you install a new garage door and garage door opener? 
[01:42:30]  That's my weekend.  I swear to God, it was a mission every weekend.  When I was living in New York doing construction, and I come up for Christmas vacation or something,  believe me, for me, a vacation was great.  Now it's like, you know, this is vacation.  It's nice to get away.  But it's not like we're working here.  When I was working, vacations were cherished, cherished.  Every Christmas, there we are going up to Boston where I would have to do some type of construction work around the house because that was it. 
[01:43:00]  Could you install an air-conditioning vent into my den?  Oh, my God.  You know, Jennifer, why do I have to go and do the work I do?  This is what I do.  I install air-conditioning vent on my vacation.  God damn it.  My mother doesn't ask for a lot.  Oh!  Could you knock this wall down and put it in a box? 
[01:43:30]  Could you pick up Ani Mog?  Up Anonima, Ani Mog.  She's dead.  Remember the Ani Mog stories?  I used to love her.  She's now dead.  Ani Mog.  Ani Mog was actually pretty cool.  Learn Anthony needs to be a doctor.  What?  Just talking.  What?  People are looking at me all horrified.  People are turning down their radio.  I want to go home.  Just taking a little listen.  About time is what I've been thinking. 
[01:44:00]  Who are you wearing?  I'm wearing a Chester.  To the Ayahuasca.  It's Chester.  You're wearing a Chester.  It's wonderful.  It's a great song.  How long have I been here? 
[01:44:30]  Two minutes.  That seems like an hour.  Huh?  What?  Oh, nothing.  I'm just sitting back listening.  Like everyone else.  Did you install a garage door opener?  Yeah, okay.  What's that?  What's that take?  Go to C.S.  Go to the mall in Famigham.  Pick up a garage door opener.  And install it. 
[01:45:00]  Great.  It's my vacation.  Cool.  Cool.  What am I going to do on vacation?  Let me drive all the way to Massachusetts to put in a garage door opener.  This is great.  I'm enjoying the hell out of myself.  Did you install a tap in the wall for my box of wine?  Box of wine.  Box.  Oh, my God.  And then once Jen got that job at the liquor store, whoo-hoo, discount.  I can step up to the bill and go, uh, box of wine.  It's like, gee, Mom's in again. 
[01:45:30]  I want to go home.  Can I?  What?  You were there.  You were there for the whole thing, Opie.  Don't look so shocked.  No, I want to remind you of something.  Oh, no.  What?  We'll be back.  We'll be back.  Oh, yeah, I remember that. 
[01:46:00]  Thanks for that, Opie, that little tidbit.  I don't know how I blocked it out, because it was a nightly occurrence.  There I am, starting a brand new career in radio.  Thanks to who?  Really trying.  Opie.  Huh?  Who?  Who?  Opie.  What?  That's right.  Opie.  Okay.  Absolutely.  Absolutely. 
[01:46:30]  You should get a divorce from me.  I wouldn't have a leg to stand on.  And, uh...  Every friggin' night, I get the call from the house.  Because, uh, the both of them, you know, having some cocktails.  Having a couple of cocktails.  Some mother-daughter cocktails.  Totally like tanks.  And, uh, and I get the, I get the phone call.  Come pick me up.  Where are you?  I'm in the mom's house. 
[01:47:00]  I'm in the house, and then you're bringing all the books away.  And I would have to drive to the mother's house, because she wouldn't drive, uh, Jennifer home.  For some reason.  You had to pass your house.  Yeah!  I had to pass my house.  Meanwhile, she, the mother would pick up Jennifer from the liquor store.  And instead of driving her home, we'd drive her to her house.  Drop her off.  You know why?  I want to go home.  Because going there to pick her up was never going to pick her up. 
[01:47:30]  Sit down and have a cocktail.  Pet me in the chest of them.  Say hello.  Hello.  And, and I'd have to sit there.  But thank God something good was on TV.  They would tape General Hospital and then watch it once I got there.  For some reason.  Like, because Jennifer would have gotten home, and the mother taped the soap opera so Jennifer  could watch it.  Yeah.  But they had something else to watch until, like, 7 o'clock or 7.30 when I got there. 
[01:48:00]  All right, we're going to watch the soap opera.  Get me, could you get a box of wine?  Get me a scotch.  Oh, my God.  I love that John Black.  Jennifer knows the mirror as a scumbag.  What?  No, no.  What's the matter?  Why, why, why am I being looked at so strangely?  Anthony's lawyer checking in.  Stop, Anthony.  Stop now.  Tony!  God damn, you guys are messed up.  And I feel your pain. 
[01:48:30]  Oof.  I don't feel any pain.  No kidding, you box wine drinking hobo.  But I want to go home.  It's like the new end.  He's starting to...  Oh, yeah, the new end.  To blow off steam.  It's therapy.  It is therapy.  Well, I was fine with leaving it alone.  But you're doing like soliloquies.  I mean, when you get into this...  When he gets into this, though, it's like, it's not a conversation.  You just sit back and listen until he's done.  Okay, here he goes again.  He's off and running.  But I had completely blocked out the time we were flying from Boston to Los Angeles. 
[01:49:00]  Los Angeles, right.  At this time, the significant others were still in New York.  We were living at my mother-in-law's house, correct?  And Opie has to remind me that for a 10-minute drive, we needed a lift to what is called the Logan Shuttle.  It's a bus.  We wanted a ride to Logan Airport, which was 45 minutes away.  I can't drive to Logan. 
[01:49:30]  I don't like driving all the way to the airport.  Don't like it.  I want to stay home.  Or begging, because we don't know the area yet.  Right.  We don't know nothing of the area.  So she said she'll drop us off at the Logan Shuttle.  The Logan Express is a bus that'll take you to the airport.  It's a few minutes away.  So we all get in the car, and she drives, which later on, after we had lived there a while,  we realized where she was taking us was probably a 10-minute drive. 
[01:50:00]  It hops, you get on a road, you get on another road, and you're there.  It took us about 45 minutes to get to this place, because I had blocked this out whenever the mother-in-law would take us anywhere.  I can't make a left turn.  I can't make a left turn.  But three rights makes a left.  And I always take the side streets.  I always take the back roads, because I don't like the highways.  Highways? 
[01:50:30]  It's Route 9, if you're familiar with Boston.  It's not.  No, it's like Jericho Turnpike on the island.  It's not.  I can't take lefts.  She's afraid.  I'm afraid to make left turn tins.  Afraid.  So we sat there on this Mr. Toad's wild ride through the backwoods of suburban Massachusetts,  when we realized later on this is a 10-minute drive.  And she's driving us, you know, to the Logan Shop, because I can't drive to the airport.  We almost missed our flight. 
[01:51:00]  Remember that?  I can't.  I choose not to make left turn tins.  But even better, remember when you had to go to Annie Mark's?  Annie Mark's.  That was the best story that you told at lunch today.  To this day, I couldn't tell you how to get there, because it was this maze thing.  She should drive for the mob when you're trying to take a prisoner to the camp.  You wouldn't even have to blindfold them.  I couldn't remember where we were.  We'd be driving down these back roads, and, you know, I'd be driving in my car. 
[01:51:30]  She's in the back seat.  Going, all right, make a left here.  Now turn, make a right.  I don't know how to make the left, so we're just going to take the way I take, which is a bunch of right hands tins.  Make a right, make a right.  And I'm driving in circles.  During this way, and later, after living there a while, I realized, again, had to be a five-minute drive.  Five-minute drive.  It took a half hour.  But the funny part about that story, she wasn't driving.  You were driving.  She was giving directions with all right turns. 
[01:52:00]  I don't even like being in the car during left hands tins.  And she finally told you that the reason, yeah, she went that way was because she doesn't like left-handed turns.  She didn't know how to get there.  Dude, she did not know how to get there telling me how to get there by making left turns because she never had done it.  So I'm like, why are we making a right?  I know it's got to be this way because the town that we were going to is that way.  Well, Anthony, because...  Make a right.  Okay.  Go up, make a right.  Now make this right.  Three rights.  Three rights.  It's a left.  Three rights, make a left. 
[01:52:30]  Three rights, make a left.  Where's my scotch?  Get the box of wine.  Unbelievable.  Thank you for refreshing my memory.  I'm sure you'll come up with a bunch more, Opie.  Opie remembers.  He takes pleasure in saying his dad, remember this time?  Judy did this.  I'm like, ah!  I blocked it off.  Bill, what's going on?  Hey, guys, what's up?  Hey.  I got a guy that works with us that does not make left turns, and he's a service tech.  He drives all day long on the island, and when he goes into Manhattan, he's a total nightmare. 
[01:53:00]  He just keeps going right and right and right and right to get back.  So he doesn't make left either?  No, not at all.  He's, like, petrified of it.  It's crazy.  Huh.  And when anybody else drives with him, it makes us nuts driving with him.  You'd have to be a goddamn lunatic to make a left-on turn.  I stick to right because then I only got to look one way.  It's the right turn.  Your brother wants in on this.  Joe.  Hey, Joe.  That kooks. 
[01:53:30]  And what about the time that we played up at, I forget the name of the place.  Oh, God.  We were playing.  Yeah.  And you had to take the van that we moved the equipment in to take her home.  Dude, that was an I want to go home story.  Oh, get this.  Rotgut's playing.  We live down in New York.  We got a gig up in Boston.  Kind of exciting and fun for a band.  So, Judy wants to go.  I want to go and see Rotgut.  So, all right. 
[01:54:00]  We pile in.  She drives with one of her friends.  Not with us.  She gets there.  Her friend leaves her there.  Because Judy goes, I want to stay and watch the band.  So, the friend leaves.  End of the night comes.  We just get done with the set.  I want to hang out.  I want to go home.  Like, you want to hang with the band?  We're having a good time.  We're up in Boston.  This is kick-ass.  I want to go home.  I go to my brother, Joe.  I got to take the van.  The equipment's going to be loaded in shortly. 
[01:54:30]  Just move the equipment off the stage.  And I will be right back.  I am just taking Judy home.  I know nothing of the area.  Judy's going to give me directions on how to get from Boston, the club,  to about 20 miles in the suburbs to her house.  I was lost.  So lost.  She's drunk off her ass on the front seat.  And I'm looking at my watch going, the band thinks I'm dead.  Because I've got to be dead.  Oh, yeah.  We definitely thought you got into some kind of horrible disfitting reaction.  The equipment now is being either locked in the club for the night 
[01:55:00]  or moved out into the snow.  Where the band's got nowhere to load the equipment.  As I'm driving Judy around, now the truck's running out of gas.  Judy, where's the gas station?  I don't know.  I got the hump.  I know where there's one in Iceland.  And she's flopping all over the seat.  Dude, I was getting so pissed.  I started jamming on the brakes just to watch her flop into the footwell  and then, like, pull her back up on the seat.  Do you have any idea where we are? 
[01:55:30]  No, this doesn't look familiar.  Finally, finally, get her home.  I swear, I just about slowed the band down and pushed her out in front of the house.  Got back maybe two or two and a half hours after I left.  It was supposed to be maybe a 45- to 50-minute trip, like an hour tops my own trip.  Two and a half hours later, I come back to a band that wanted to effing kill me.  It was closer to three and a half hours. 
[01:56:00]  Yeah.  They wanted to kill me.  I thought for sure you got, you know, you had an accident.  Yeah.  And there's Judy, 90 pounds, soaking wet, flopping around the cab of this truck, hammered.  I don't know.  What road are we on?  Now, here's your mistake.  You made a left hand.  You made the mistake that you made a left hand chair.  Yeah, we moved stuff out into the street that night.  Anthony, what are we going to do about this?  Let me see. 
[01:56:30]  Where are we?  I have no clue where we are, Judy.  You have to look around.  Tell me which way to go.  We are on Route 9 somewhere in Nadek.  Nadek?  I know a great place for fried clams and steamers right up the road.  Judy, it's 3 in the morning.  Oh, I love a hum.  I want to go hum.  Can we stop and get a box of wine?  I swear to God.  So when I finally got back, yeah, the guys were fuming and pissed. 
[01:57:00]  But that right there is an example of I want to go hum.  I want to hum.  Thanks for the reminder, Joe.  All right, man.  All right, Joe.  Thank you.  Steve, what's going on?  It's N.E.W.  How you doing, guys?  Good.  Opie, wasn't there a situation at the mother-in-law's house about a painting or a poster?  Where she took my picture down because...  Yeah, that was it.  That was it.  Oh, there was a picture of the Demented World cover.  Right.  That's right.  That she had up on the wall.  And then when...  Probably displayed.  The marriage went on the fritz. 
[01:57:30]  She was like...  I just feel bad that I also have to get rid of Opie.  A picture of Opie.  Oh, they're together.  So, yeah, she felt kind of bad about that.  Did she like Opie better than you?  Well, she probably does now.  I'll tell you that one.  She could have just cut you out of the Demented World picture and kept him hanging.  There you go.  Take care, guys.  All right, Steve.  I want to go home.  Cool.  I want to go home.  All right, why don't we take a break?  Yes.  212-757-1027.  We'll be back in just a bit. 
[01:58:00]  Opie Anthony.  Opie Anthony.  Opie Anthony.  1027.  WNEW.  All afternoon.  Opie and Anthony's WOW Road Trip on WNEW.  I don't even know if we're live on the radio, but guys, say hi to everyone.  Hi. 
[01:58:30]  We have an unbelievable crowd.  It's a lot of people.  I don't even know where we are.  Well, this is by far the sickest crowd we've been to yet on this tour that we've been doing.  Opie, how many boos have you seen?  At least 20 girls.  Yeah, as it is.  This has been unbelievable. 
[01:59:00]  Oh, that's been a year.  That's been a year.  Really just a great time we're having here and around us.  Unbelievable.  I don't know what else to say.  We're having a good time.  I'm signing stuff.  I mean, people, huge fans of the show, so appreciate it.  This guy's got an XFL picture of us on this.  And the XFL did so well.  It's really unbelievable. 
[01:59:30]  There's got to be well over 1,000 people here in the park.  I'm going to say to me, I know it's Mark Benson of East Iceland.  Very cool.  He just turned 40 today.  No last Saturday.  Mark, that's from your buddy Joe.  We're heading to Long Island.  In a little while, we're going to be at the Dublin Pub in New High Park.  I believe that's where it's low-chained.  But unbelievable.  Where's Norton?  Norton was around here.  Oh, Norton's with a check.  Okay.  All right.  I don't know if he wanted a million people to hear that then, but thank you.  Okay.  Norton walked off with a check. 
[02:00:00]  Norton was on with a check.  He's over there.  Try to get Norton.  Go, go.  There's Jim.  Jim, come over here.  Anthony is, like, signing away.  We're, like, we can't even move.  There's so many people around.  I can just take this.  And I want to thank the person that gave us a bottle of vodka since we were running low on the bus.  Right, Anthony?  Really?  Oh, yeah.  The vodka.  Anthony is so happy now.  And Stinky, it's sad.  He fell down when he heard we had a bottle of vodka.  Here's another bottle, Anthony. 
[02:00:30]  Nice.  A little absolute.  Thank you.  Also, I want to thank the Paramus Police Department.  They've been really, really cool.  They're actually helping us with sound control in the parking lot here in Paramus.  So, thank you.  We're getting Jim Norton.  Here's Jim Norton, everybody.  Hey, how you doing, man?  It's great.  We got a naked chick right now on a pool table.  We're going to rape her.  And you know your life sucks when you're actually happy to be in Paramus. 
[02:01:00]  But it's great, man.  The place is mobbed.  There's a lot of chicks.  There's a lot of, what's that, bro?  All right.  There's some serial killer back there with a garbage bag.  They're really psychos.  They're all hot.  It's just a great gig, man.  There's a lot of people out here.  So, you couldn't make it down.  You missed out.  Here's Alty.  I'm going to go try to talk.  All right.  I think we're going to hang here for another, I don't know, 10 or 15 minutes because there  are so many people we're meeting.  This has just been really, really cool here at Paramus.  When we get back on the loud bus, we've got to figure out exactly where we're going to next. 
[02:01:30]  I don't know if we're going to have time to go up to the Yonkers, but we'll figure it out  and give you a live report from the loud bus.  Also, guys, just a reminder, the Whistler Bikini contest continues.  We're down to the fourth finalists.  It's really important you guys vote all weekend long.  You can vote every day.  You guys know the deal.  And we'll announce the grand prize winner for that trip to Hawaii first thing when we're  back in the studio on Monday.  Anyway, also, my buddy, my pal, a guy that gave me my big break in the radio is coming  down to do a show live from the WNWB studios. 
[02:02:00]  That's for the week.  We'll be on tomorrow night.  And I'm going to be hanging in the studio.  So that's going to be a lot of fun to listen to as well.  Anthony, any final thoughts before we hang with the crowd a little more here?  Go.  Yes, go.  Very good.  All right.  Come on.  I think you can hear the crowd.  And we'll be back in a bit.  Rick, take this away.  Thanks.  All just to go. 
[02:02:30]  Don't you have any self-respect?  Aren't you embarrassed to yourself, to your family?  Hopefully you have them for me.  Human, human, swine.  107 WNEW.  Saturday night, starting at 7.  WNEW gives you E.  Hey, what's up, Weezer?  And cheese.  This is my, this is my.  7 at 10.  It's Brother Weed.  Endorsed by Opie and Anthony.  At 10.  Eddie Trump cranked out the best variety of metal.  Hey, what's up, Weezer?  And cheesy hair bands on Saturday Night Rock. 
[02:03:00]  Wee's wheeze.  Nice.  And cheese.  All afternoon.  Opie and Anthony's WOW road trip on WNEW.  Look at that, Opie.  We continue to be an award-winning show.  Who does the voting?  Because are they on heroin?  Cool.  The Opie and Anthony show.  Beyond comedies, beyond fiction.  1027.  This is Anthony, I believe we are live once again on the radio. 
[02:03:30]  It's up for Robert Succese!  This is absolutely insane.  I'm stuck in way down the snow in the crowd here.  There are girls just wowing everywhere.  I'm getting on a guy's shoulders and just showing what they've got.  We really appreciate, obviously, all the guys and girls that are hanging here forever. 
[02:04:00]  Anthony, this is Allison, the best ass contest winner.  Yes, and if you look at her ass, you'll see it's fine, Opie.  Show off your ass.  She's now taking down her very short shorts, the winner of the best ass contest.  And look!  Oh, wait!  Oh, wait a minute!  I just saw something else on her other seat!  Anthony!  There he is!  Sorry, guys!  Whoever signed that ass, a floppy pendants are there. 
[02:04:30]  I guess we're going to be heading out in just a bit.  A lot of people want to know, Elsa, why you weren't in the whipped cream bikini contest.  I thought required, like, you know, fake breasts or something.  But I'll go for the best body contest, okay?  The fake boobs?  Not a big feature in our contest.  Thomas, I will do the best body contest.  There you go.  Okay.  The best body contest is going to be the best body contest.  Also, I guess we should break this news today here in Piranus, New Jersey.  Here in Piranus, New Jersey!  There's it! 
[02:05:00]  I learned that from Mick Foley.  You just bring the sound you're in and they go, no.  It's a great way to get a scream and a yell going up.  But, Anthony, we're going to have another contest.  Maybe as soon as next week, we're going to do one of those mothers I like to...  Mothers I like to...  Ah!  Yeah, the milk.  We're going to do a milk contest.  And that's going to be a lot of fun.  Probably as early as Monday.  Right, Anthony?  The most...  Not a popular contest as far as I'm concerned. 
[02:05:30]  I prefer the team contest myself.  But I think this will be popular because we're looking for ladies that are probably in their 30s with children and have hot bodies.  And that's part of the contest.  Anthony, with that said about the team, I have another announcement to make.  I have another announcement to make here in Piranus, New Jersey!  Thank you, Miss Foley.  Now we're fucking strong, man.  The teenage lingerie contest coming soon to the O&A show. 
[02:06:00]  Thank you!  Alright, Anthony, I guess we've got to...  I don't know.  We've got to get back on the bus.  We've got to get back on the bus.  I think what we're going to do is...  You know, we're going to play an old bit from the O&A archive.  People, block the script.  We're stuck in traffic.  Sit back.  Turn up your speakers.  And enjoy Jill, the hot wax girl.  On WNW, it's O&A Live from Piranus!  Opie Anthony.  Opie Anthony.  Opie Anthony. 
[02:06:30]  Opie Anthony.  1027.  WNW.  Opie Anthony.  Opie Anthony.  1027.  WNW.  Opie Anthony.  Opie Anthony.  Opie Anthony.  Opie Anthony.  A little information.  Oh, this girl is so freaking hot, too, man.  She was at our impromptu little road show we did at LeVar about a month ago.  Yes.  And she has volunteered to allow us to drip hot wax all over her smoking body.  Hot wax?  Her smoking body.  What's her name, Rick?  Jill.  Okay.  Okay.  I remember. 
[02:07:00]  I don't remember her name, but I remember her name.  Jill.  Bring her in.  You'll remember, Jill.  She showed everyone her ass.  Oh, really?  Lovely.  Look at this.  Oh, yes, I remember.  Wow.  How are you doing?  Great to see you again, Jill.  Well, Jill is beautiful.  What nationality are you?  Yeah.  She's Italian.  Yeah, 100% it looks like.  So have you had wax drips all over your body before?  No, I've never had.  Really?  No?  You're a wax virgin?  Yeah, we were.  There's some really hot MTV video. 
[02:07:30]  I don't even know the song, don't know the band, but there was a scene where the guy's just dripping hot wax all over the girl.  And it's not the Ricky Martin video, because there was some of that going on in La Vida Loca.  Yeah, whatever.  Whatever that stupid song was.  This one was a much hotter scene.  Yeah.  Well, there's a whole trick to it, you know.  You don't get too close with the wax.  Right.  Have you had it?  So it's not hot.  No, I've just seen it in the corner.  Have you had it?  I've had it done, yeah.  Oh, you have them?  Yeah, you've got to make sure you drip the wax from high above. 
[02:08:00]  That would mean a little higher up through close.  A little too close.  Ouch.  Ouch.  Ouch.  All right, Jill, now where would you like the wax that drips?  Out of the stomach, Andy.  And work your way up, kind of?  Well, Ann, I think we're ready.  Yeah, I think so.  All right, where's the candles?  Candles from the wonderful Yank Me Candle Company. 
[02:08:30]  All right, we're going to start with the stomach, is that?  We've got to lose the shirt, then.  You've got to lose the shirt.  All right, well, let's start with the stomach.  Yeah, you could lay right out there.  Just don't hit any of those vital cough buttons.  Hey, let's move over to these mics.  All right.  What if you would take my mic?  There we go.  Wow.  Yeah, that's the interrogation mic. 
[02:09:00]  Look at this.  She's wow.  Wow.  She's, I can't really hear myself.  She's lounged out.  What are you doing there, Rick?  All right.  She said no pics.  She agreed without her face.  There are no tapes.  I swear.  There are no tapes.  Where's Liddy?  Maybe he can plant a camera.  She's in a really hot position right now.  Yeah.  We're way above her.  Her stomach is, your stomach is perfect. 
[02:09:30]  What size boobs you got there?  I have 34B.  34B.  34B.  They're nice.  Very nice.  Okay, we're lighting the candles, Anthony.  All right.  Let's get this lit.  Make sure you scream right into the mic.  Oh, she's undoing her pants, Anthony.  Yeah, you don't want any wax to get on those really nice pants.  Oh, look at these panties that we're about to see.  Don't be shy.  What are those?  Oh, yeah, little leopard print.  Those are like Victoria's Secret, right?  Very good.  I know my panties. 
[02:10:00]  You're going to have to edge toward Opie a little more because I'm not going to be able  to hold the candle high enough with the top of the thingy here.  Here, pull her pants down.  Pull her pants down.  Oh, okay, George.  You just can't wait, can you?  Well, you have really nice pants on, and I don't want to get the wax all over  your pants.  It'll be okay right now.  Thanks for your support.  Okay.  All right, Ann, you want to start?  You're a little closer to the stomach area.  You better get up high, though.  I'll get up high.  I will.  All right, what are you aiming for?  Ow!  It's higher. 
[02:10:30]  Does that hurt?  Oh, that burns a little.  Yeah, it will.  It's not wax.  Yeah.  All right, let me do a couple of things.  Where are those lead soldiers?  Let's melt a few of those down.  All right, wait, move closer to the edge, though, so I can get the candle higher.  You'll actually have to move up your head toward Opie a little more.  We get paid to do this stuff?  No.  You can just kind of wrap around the counter a little.  All right, I'm going to...  Oh, you've got to go.  I'm aiming right for the belly button.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh!  Oh!  That had to hurt.  Oh, I'll go higher.  How's that?  It's so good.  Oh, my God. 
[02:11:00]  Hey, I'm not stopping.  It's like Ethan Forcher.  All right.  Oh, my God.  All right, keep stirring.  Wait, there's too much green wax.  I'm the red wax guy.  Hey, get higher.  Higher.  All right, all right.  Oh, God, you're going to cook the burger.  Oh, my God.  I'm going to get this stuff out.  Look at her.  She's like squirming.  This is great.  All right, roll over.  Let's do your ass.  Huh?  Can you say you wrote your name on somebody once? 
[02:11:30]  Yeah, I wrote...  How did we do that with wax?  How did we do that then?  Oh, this girl was dead.  She was a corpse, so she really didn't move that much.  Oh, wait.  Oh, now we've got a pedestal.  I wish Martha Stewart would do something like this with candles.  Take out my headphones.  Great way to spend the holidays, dripping hot wax on people.  I'm going high.  Are we going for the butt, too?  Peel some off.  See what it looks like under that.  Hey, okay.  Be careful.  It's going to fall and shove the candle somewhere.  Ow, by the way, I just slipped them on my finger and it hurt from about an inch away. 
[02:12:00]  Ow, ow, ow.  What body part are we going for now?  Uh, the ass.  We've got to lose the pants.  Yeah, lose the pants.  Okay.  I'll lose them.  Can I just...  Well, you can keep trace of them, but...  Can I just take them down?  No, you can pull them down.  Yeah, that's fine.  And then we'll make you walk around.  Hey, she just hit Rick.  Cool.  Wow.  She's got a thong on.  That's pretty nice.  All right, she's turning over.  She's got a perfect, perfect ass.  Look at that ass.  Whoa, what...  We are speechless. 
[02:12:30]  All right, Rick's getting a picture for, of course, the unofficial website.  That could be the best ass we've ever had in a studio, Anthony.  Bravo.  Turn to the mic, because we want our listeners to hear this.  Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.  Yeah, just like that.  All right, I'll say.  All right, I'm sorry.  A little higher, a little higher, maybe?  Okay.  Wow.  Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.  On the cheek.  Wow, it's squirming around like crazy. 
[02:13:00]  Oh, she's losing it.  Okay.  She's losing it.  How cool is that, man?  Is there a home version of this game?  How's it feel?  Did you think it would sting that much?  Are you liking it?  That was Ann.  Anthony just threw a lit match at her.  Wait, I want one more.  I'm going way up high here.  Move your butt to the edge.  Yes.  All right, here we go. 
[02:13:30]  I'm going for the right cheek.  Oh, my God.  It almost tickles.  It almost tickles.  All right.  It hurts, but it tickles.  Oh, my God.  Look at that one.  Isn't that funny?  It looks like some wacky kind of alien creature's ass.  It's got the green and red dot com.  It kind of looks like a disease.  Oh, now we're going to throw you on the right cheek of the universe.  Is that okay?  All right. 
[02:14:00]  Are you taking a picture of the waxed ass?  No, get the other angle, man.  I have an equation.  Oh, my God.  That was like a whole cup full.  All right.  Very good.  It's starting to really build up in here.  Now, Jill, is it erotic at all or no?  It could be.  It could be?  Okay.  How about a boobage?  I don't know.  Yeah, a boobage.  We'll go from way high up.  We'll go way high.  It'll be completely dry by the time.  Actually, you could get on the floor.  It won't feel anything like this. 
[02:14:30]  Get on the floor.  All right.  All right.  She's going after it.  Come here.  Hear it.  No.  Hear it.  No.  It's not going to show his ass.  No.  It's not going to show his ass.  No.  Do it on my hand.  We'll let you do it on your hands.  We'll let you do it on your hands.  No way.  I'm not pulling down my hands.  It's not happening.  Jill, get on the floor.  Jill, I'm way up high here.  Oh, someone light my candle fast.  Light man, thank you.  Hey, get up.  Get way up here. 
[02:15:00]  Are we going for the boobs from 20 feet up?  Yes.  And now Jill's on the floor.  Yeah.  We're about 15 feet up in the air.  Are we going to...  We're aiming for the boobs, right?  Yeah.  Okay.  We'll have people leave the studio if you feel uncomfortable.  I'll take off the boobs.  Oh, she's going to take off her boobs.  Don't hit her face.  Oh!  Oh, God!  All right, cover her face, because this could be a problem.  Put a paper bag on her head.  No offense, because you do have a very nice face, but get a paper bag for her head. 
[02:15:30]  No, that ain't going to work.  Get a paper bag.  I'm serious.  A paper bag for her head.  She'll be the unknown lesbian.  All right, Jill.  Wow, this is a very nice position you got there.  Yeah, she can do that.  You don't want to get any on that bra, though.  No, we need the bra off.  Yeah, we do.  Yeah, if you cover your face, she'll be fine.  You have nothing to hide.  Trust me.  All right, I feel special.  She'll take her bra off for us. 
[02:16:00]  Yeah.  All right, here comes the bra.  Oh, wow.  Very nice.  There we go.  That is some fine ta-tas.  Okay.  Wait, move the bra.  Yeah.  Dude, you sure you don't want to give her, like, a bag or something for her head?  Hold it closed, because it might be splatter.  Yeah.  Like, hold it under your chin, kind of.  All right.  There you go.  Ready?  I'm way above it.  I'm way above.  A little higher.  Oh, she's right in the head.  Oh, my gosh.  That would have hit her right in the face.  All right, she's squeezing her boobs together because of the pain. 
[02:16:30]  I'm going to try for the nip.  Okay.  I'm going for the nip.  Oh, my gosh.  My lip, ta-bomb, right in the head.  It hurts.  All right.  All right, back off.  All right, back off for a second.  Let's see who got closer.  I got closer to the bullseye.  You did?  Yeah, you have the right boob.  I have the left one, and my max got closer.  Wow.  I wish I could say what that looks like right now.  That's pretty good.  That is stupid.  It's like a Norton bombsite.  You're doing a game.  All right, one more.  I'm going to the clown.  One more splatter.  Okay.  One more pass, and we'll be done. 
[02:17:00]  Here we go.  Ready?  From above.  Walk it in, walk it in, walk it in.  Walk it in, walk it in.  Oh, I almost got...  Oh, bullseye.  Oh, you got it.  I feel it.  Anthony wins.  Somebody got bullseye.  He is shaking.  Anthony wins.  Anthony wins.  I think she has a wood floor.  Really?  Yeah, look.  You need that wax?  Well, Jill, how did that feel?  Not bad. 
[02:17:30]  Yeah?  Pretty good.  Pretty good.  Pretty good.  More aska?  Yeah, turn it over on your butt.  Look at the aska.  More aska.  We can get a ton of boobs with the wax all over them.  Okay.  All right, turn it over.  Let me get one more.  It's like this.  Yes.  Yeah, it is.  Yeah.  Oh, I thought you were talking about our pants.  No, of course she's talking about the wax all over her chest, Anthony.  Okay.  Looks like she has the measles.  Weird, dude.  Oh, my God.  It feels really weird.  Yeah, it does feel weird. 
[02:18:00]  All right.  All right.  We're going for the wax.  We're going for the wax.  Back to the wax.  Ah!  Oh, she's cursed.  She's cursed.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, she's driving at us.  She's insane.  She's had it.  She's had it up.  She's had it up.  She's tapped out.  She's tapped out.  One, two, three.  She's out.  Is that a kind of burn? 
[02:18:30]  You think?  She'll talk into a mic.  How does that feel?  Not bad.  It feels okay.  It's all right.  Peel one off.  Let me see what it looks like underneath.  Peel off a little thing.  That one's really nice.  Is it red?  No.  No, she's fine.  Oh, you take it like a chance.  Yes, I do.  That's our only third-degree burn.  Cool.  The hospital's really close to me.  Napalm.  All right.  That was, like, the best thing of those times.  Naked, nate that ass.  All right, Ant.  Wow.  That rocked. 
[02:19:00]  That was pretty cool.  That was real cool.  It's like a Mark coming in with his own candle that he wants to drip on.  Put that away, Mark.  He's got a little wick anyway.  All right.  Jill's getting her clothes back on.  The phone's just going nuts here, Anthony, as you would expect.  Jack, what's up?  I can't remember.  Jack.  Hello?  Hey, what's up?  Wow, we're going to wax.  Jeff, not Jack.  Oh, sorry, Jeff.  What's up? 
[02:19:30]  You guys are killing me.  You obviously have a girl that was very sensitive, delicate skin.  Now that you have your pot wax on her, can't you at least soothe her with a tongue bath or some ice cubes?  Would you like some ice cubes, Jill?  Actually, I might.  Oh, look at him.  Look at him.  Look at him.  Look at him.  Rick, run.  Run like the wind, Rick.  Four guys just died.  Oh, there you go.  A couple of icy cold Budweiser.  Buds.  We're not drinking them.  No, they still happen to be in the area, and they're ice cold.  Oh, there you go.  They're icing. 
[02:20:00]  I have a boyfriend, so what is it?  Oh, my God.  He's a friend.  He's a friend.  Yeah, the guy that walked in all of a sudden now is like, get out.  All right, they're icing down the area.  Icing down her butt with a couple of cold Buds.  Yes.  Don't you guys owe it to her to at least be the ones to ice her down?  You did inflict the pain.  I do want to go home tonight, sir.  Don't you have an almost divorcee in that studio with you?  I'm intending litigation, sir. 
[02:20:30]  I can't use this.  It can be used against me.  You've got a paper bag on your head.  Thank you, buddy.  Wow, Greg checking in.  14 years old.  You guys make puberty fun.  Glad we can help.  Yeah, we didn't have this when we were growing up.  Hey, they're going to get it somewhere, and we might as well supply the info.  I learned it from you, okay?  All right, we've got to thank Jill for stopping on by the show.  That rocked.  Thank you.  How would you like to mow my lawn?  Yeah, it's already mowed, believe me. 
[02:21:00]  I'm the neighbor.  I'm the neighbor.  Shut it, shut it, shut it, shut it.  I'm the neighbor.  Look at it.  Shut it, shut it, shut it, shut it.  What the hell was that?  I'm going for a set.  We have a day.  I'm going for a set.  We have a day.  We have a day. 
[02:21:30]  I'll be having a check for you.  What?  You're not going to do it.  You're not going to do it.  You're not going to do it.  Okay, watch this.  It's me, baby.  Get out of here.  What?  It's me, baby.  Stupid friggin' twat.  This is a turn-off.  This is a post.  I'll show you how serious I am.  I can't do it.  I can't do it.  I can't do it.  It's a fucking thing.  Howdy, maggots. 
[02:22:00]  You have a son of a bitch.  Oh, boy.  I just didn't run.  No clue.  Anthony, I have no clue, but I think we're back live on the radio.  We are getting back on the wow bus to continue our road trip.  I want to thank the Kalamans Police Department.  We're watching you all for helping us out in the park around here. 
[02:22:30]  Also, we've got to thank the partners at Planet Java.  They've been following me the whole day, giving out three samples of Planet Java.  Yeah, I've got to tell you, coming here to Paramus, I think the next road show should be at Paramus.  What a crowd.  This has been the biggest crowd so far.  We've been hanging out with these people, and fantastic.  Unbelievable.  The Anthony J2 chant doesn't quite work as well. 
[02:23:00]  Thank you, though.  Thank you for the effort.  But we've seen some wows, and the Paramus Police have been great.  They've come up here and said hi.  Now there's a precious chant, Opie.  Thank you.  It's just because they love.  Wow, there's another girl on top of a car.  Really?  Wow, there's another girl.  We just took over the parcel out today.  There she goes, dude.  There she goes.  All right, I guess we've really got to get out of here.  We're moving on.  We've got to figure out where we're going next. 
[02:23:30]  I think we have to readjust the entire promotion when the stuff starts rolling again.  I think we might have to go right to Long Island.  I'm not really sure.  So, Rick, why don't you take it?  I think we have a few commercials to play, and then we'll be back.  It's ONA live from Paramus, New Jersey, as we board the wild bus at Virginia Alba.  Opie Anthony.  Opie Anthony.  Opie Anthony.  1027 WMEW.  All right, I think we're back. 
[02:24:00]  Well, I know we're back on the wild bus, but I think we're back on the radio.  And we're in the middle of the most of this, Opie Anthony.  Anthony, Vermont teddy bear.  Give me the phone, Opie.  It's so much easier in the studio when you have the mics in front of us.  But, yes, Vermont teddy bear.  Monday.  Mother's Day is Sunday.  Oh, Jesus Christ, this is bad.

Serving New Jersey, Connecticut, Long Island.  This is 1027-WNEW, New York.  It's the Opie and Anthony show in England.  Do you know what to do?  By fact, I don't know.  I'm trying to push a button. 
[02:26:00]  What button should I push?  Push the pretty red button.  Oh, it's retarded.  That's what you get when you put unprofessionals on.  1027.  We are a bunch of retards.  W-N-W.  All right, I think we're back on the wild bus.  Once again, I know we're back on the wild bus,  but I think we're back on the radio,  but I keep trying to say here.  I'm just, I was just overwhelmed by the crowd  and the noise of Parameter.  The people of Parameter treat us very, very well.  All right.  Yeah, like King. 
[02:26:30]  It was amazing.  The second we stepped off the bus,  pandemonium.  We got two bottles of vodka from his, you know,  and Stinky and Ben couldn't be more happier.  Ben was rucking to a payphone to annoy people on the phone,  his friends,  because we were using his cell phone.  But he had to find a phone  so he could be obnoxious on the phone for his friends.  And we had a great time.  Parameter, I got to say,  we got to do a road show there.  They were a clucky, receptive crowd. 
[02:27:00]  Wows?  How many wows?  That couldn't even count.  The women not shy in Parameter, we found out.  Thank you.  Not shy at all.  But more importantly,  how is Stinky still standing?  Stinky, how are you now?  Awesome!  Woo!  Now, how did you handle the crowd in Paramus?  I saw you were working it.  You were extreme!  Woo!  That's Stinky so fast.  I can't.  He is a mess.  This guy's having the time of his life. 
[02:27:30]  We got to thank Mall Security for helping us out.  Planet Java was here.  Ending our samples.  Also want to say hey to Frank, the bus driver, today.  Great job.  He doesn't like being called the guy driving the bus.  So, Frank, thank you very much.  He's listening to this up in the front seat.  Look at that.  Now he's cracking the Lord because he just heard his name.  I hear at one point Stinky volunteers to drive for the rest of the route.  And actually the bus driver agreed until he tried to pull out of the lot 
[02:28:00]  and just went woo in reverse, hit something.  Now, we think it's best he stays in the back of the bus.  Woo!  But now we're going to have to alter our route, people.  We have to cut a few of the stops short.  Don't be alarmed.  We will get to you eventually.  But right now we're on our way to Dublin Pub.  Now, where exactly is that?  New Hyde Park.  New Hyde Park.  Jericho Turnpike. 
[02:28:30]  In Nashville County, among us.  Well, guys, here we come, baby!  So, this is going to be our last big stop.  If you guys could beat Paramus, God bless you, because I've got to tell you,  that was a 6-6 scene.  I think we are going to beat Paramus, because most of the people that were hanging out with us in the lot  in Paramus are following us on the bus.  There's got to be a caravan of over 100 vehicles at this point as we continue this wild road trip.  Also, I want to thank His and Hers Leathers Harley-Davidson.  What?  Oh, okay.  We gave away some His and Hers Leathers Harley-Davidson jackets. 
[02:29:00]  They were supplied by Costco Harley-Davidson.  1129 Route 23 South in Keniland, New Jersey.  Open house tomorrow, Saturday, from 10 to 5.  10 to 5!  It was funny, the first two of the times, but now we're getting a headache.  Does anyone have a exaggeration at this point?  But it's not a joke, and the guy's got a salt.  I know.  Long Island, here we come. 
[02:29:30]  We love Long Island.  We're from there.  We're going to be in Nashville County, Dublin, Palm, and New High Park, a Durk-A-Turk bike.  God knows how long it's going to take, but we'll figure it out.  You know, through traffic in the George W. Bridge, we are getting out of this bus  and getting out loud, because it's in the traffic jam.  All right.  All right, Rick, why don't you take it away?  I think we're going to the ONA Archives.  Remember when we talked to that lady that had a cat that got stuck in the dryer?  No! 
[02:30:00]  We did it!  Twinkle, I think he remembers.  Twinkle the cat.  It's WNW ONA on the WOW process.  We continue the road trip.  Check this out, and we'll be back in just a bit.  You people never cease to amaze me.  Open your mind to me.  You guys suck, yeah!  This is a stupid radio show.  Relax.  Wonderful.  And while we're at it, we can lock up a juvie and walk on.  Best quality radio.  Damn straight.  102.7.  WNW. 
[02:30:30]  212-757-1027.  It's the ONA Show.  All right, we've got a doctor on the line before we move on.  Lou, the doctor, what's going on?  Lou?  Lou, what's going on?  Listen, I have a good idea for tomorrow's show.  I want to come on and do my juggling act.  Yeah, there you go.  Hey, man, we're moving on from yesterday's show, and it wasn't even that bad, so shut up. 
[02:31:00]  Okay, have a good day.  All right, man.  All right, well, we can get to this Haywood thing.  Now, what writer fell for that gag?  Well, it's the Post.  It is the Post, right?  Yeah.  Neil Graves.  What a tool.  Probably the number one fake name.  Yeah.  Right?  I think Michael Hunt.  Michael Hunt is up there.  I can't even think of others.  Philip McCracken.  I was going to say Phil McCracken.  Phil McCracken.  Who falls for Haywood, though? 
[02:31:30]  I mean, do you know anyone named Haywood?  No.  No.  You're right.  They did an article on these coffee cafe banks, they're calling them.  Basically, you know, we've seen the internet cafes where you go and you have a cup of coffee and you surf a little bit, blah, blah, blah.  Now they're taking it to the next level and they're like bank cafes, I guess they call.  So you get your coffee and you can do online investing and things like that.  Check your stocks. 
[02:32:00]  Get some advice on, you know, where you should put your money and stuff.  And these places are popping up all over Manhattan.  So they did an article in the Post today.  And on page 45, New York Pulse, they do the story with Neil Graves.  And they interview people that just happen to be in the coffee shops doing their banking and having a cup of joe, you know.  And, God.  So here's a quote from a guy.  If I didn't work a block away, I wouldn't go in.  People who want to trade can do it from their laptop or a handheld device. 
[02:32:30]  Haywood Jablomi, 41, a Manhattan real estate agent, agreed.  This is a nice-looking store, but I don't see people coming in here to trade, he said.  Not the suits who work up here.  No way.  So Haywood is quoted in the Post today.  Haywood Jablomi.  Ja, Jablomi.  Jablomi.  Ja, Jablomi.  That guy must have laughed his ass off, not only saying it, but then reading it the next day.  Right.  Who falls for that gag? 
[02:33:00]  Try to get a Michael Hunt in there.  That's got to be the best one.  But it's funny when you see it in writing.  It's, yeah, the Post page 45, okay?  Haywood Jablomi.  We got the owner of Twinkles on the phone.  Twinkles the cat.  Rick, you're losing your effing mind.  Twinkles the dryer cat.  Well, it was a pretty...  Hey, could Rachel hear us?  Okay, can you tell Rachel we're going to be with her in about 30 seconds?  Because we want to read the story. 
[02:33:30]  It's very, very tragic what happened to her cat.  Okay, she's off the line.  Did you see?  There you go.  What a crocodile.  This was in the Post today, right?  Yeah.  A tumble dry cat survives.  Twinkles the cat was in a tumble dryer for 15 minutes.  15 minutes?  And the cat survived.  Made it through.  And Rick wants to fly Twinkles in so he can have some kind of competition where we can see if we can get a cat in the dryer for more than 15 minutes. 
[02:34:00]  Oh, come on.  You can't do that.  How did Twinkles end up in the dryer?  Twinkles is the luckiest cat in the world after being tumble dried on high heat for 15 minutes and surviving.  Hi-hee.  It's a miracle he made it.  This cat has now used up about eight and a half of his nine lives, Twinkles owner Rachel Wallace said.  Wallace of Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin adopted the long-haired feline five years ago and quickly found he was curious about everything. 
[02:34:30]  She had no idea Twinkles had climbed into the clothes dryer to investigate a new hiding place.  So when she remembered a load of wet clothes she'd left in the dryer from the night before, Wallace simply slammed the door and turned the heat up.  I put the dryer on high and went to sweep up in the kitchen.  About 15 minutes later, I heard this huge chunking, chunking, oh, clunking noise and went to check it out, she said.  It was horrifying.  Wallace and her husband, Greg, brought the cat outside and poured cold water on him. 
[02:35:00]  Cool him off.  As their three kids washed in distress.  Then they rushed him to the vet.  He was basically in shock.  It wasn't really dissimilar to an auto accident, Dr. Wayne Griffin said.  Oh, he was all beat up.  Yeah, Twinkles sustained badly burned ears and fluid in his lungs.  Oh.  And, oh, this sucks.  Griffin had to amputate his badly mangled tail.  Oh, man.  He had to be fed through a syringe for four days but is now on the road to recovery, the vet said. 
[02:35:30]  Animal experts said it was a miracle the family pet survived considering the temperature inside the dryer reached up to 160 degrees.  Wow.  That's superhuman.  I had told the kid that Twinkles was going to die but somehow he held on and kept fighting, Wallace said.  The family said Twinkles will definitely never set foot in the dryer again.  He's purring once again and staying way clear of the laundry room, Wallace said.  Now that his tail is only an inch long, we're thinking of calling him Stubby.  Ho, ho.  So, Rick, what the hell do you want us to do with the owner of this cat? 
[02:36:00]  That must have been some static cling on a long-haired cat.  Big socks.  Twinkles owner.  All right, let's plunk Rachel down.  All right.  Rachel Wallace.  Hello there.  Hi, Rachel.  Hi.  It's the Opie and Anthony Joe live in New York City.  How are you?  Great.  How are you doing today?  Pretty good.  Your story made the paper today.  Isn't that amazing?  Absolutely amazing.  We're pet lovers here in New York. 
[02:36:30]  Well, we are here in Wisconsin, too.  We just want to know, how's Twinkles doing?  Well, Twinkles is doing better.  You know, he doesn't look like himself.  He doesn't have a tail anymore.  And his ears are all burned, but he's with us.  So, he's hanging in there.  So, they didn't give us much of the story in the paper today.  Could you, you know, just give us a little overview of what happened?  Sure.  It was on April 8th.  It was a Sunday afternoon.  And I came home from church and ate our Sunday dinner.  And we thought I'd sweep the kitchen floor.  So, I was doing that.  And I thought, you know, I think I'll do some laundry while I'm at it. 
[02:37:00]  Oh, laundry.  Yeah.  You know, I quickly went to the laundry room.  And there were some leftover kind of wrinkled towels and jeans in the dryer from the night before.  So, I just quickly shut the door, slammed the door, and cranked it up on high.  Oh, my goodness.  And the cute little puss-puss was in there.  Well, you know, unbeknownst to me.  So, I went back to my sweep.  And I was doing a complete job.  I was moving furniture in the kitchen.  So, Rachel, you were the irresponsible one.  I was.  I was the irresponsible pet owner.  Is that what you're the one?  Yeah.  Responsible for the pet no longer having a tail.  I'll take full ownership for it. 
[02:37:30]  Any guilt, Rachel?  Any guilt?  You're laughing.  It sounds like something serious.  No, I can laugh now.  I can laugh now.  And I've learned that we should all, all of us that have pets, should close the dryer door at all times.  Rachel, we are card-carrying members of the People for Ethical Treatment of Animals here.  There you go.  And when we heard the story, we were horrified, quite frankly.  I know.  And I don't think you laughing.  Please don't turn me in.  I don't think you laughing about this is...  No, no, I'm...  Rachel.  No, Rachel, you're talking to two big horsey lovers. 
[02:38:00]  Okay.  I don't think laughing at her.  Why is she laughing at her?  I'll stop laughing.  Why are you laughing?  I told the story about ten times today, so you have to just excuse me, as well as the BBC.  I did an interview with the BBC last night, of all things.  The English are fags.  There you go.  So what happened was that I was sweeping, and I kept kind of hearing this kind of...  It sounded like a zipper on one of my kids' jackets or something, and I kind of ignored it.  That was probably Twinkle's teeth.  What?  And it was about, oh, I don't know, 12, 13 minutes later that the noise got so loud that I thought, 
[02:38:30]  what is that clunky noise?  And I opened the dryer, and I was horrified.  It was our cat, and the cat was...  You sound horrified with all your laughing, Rachel.  There you go.  How am I doing?  And I was horrified.  The cat was, you know, blood was coming out of his ears, his nose, his mouth.  He was roasting.  I've learned now that dryers get up to about 160 degrees.  Dare I say that?  And he was gasping for air.  Hey, Rachel, I'm the host of this radio show.  Dare I say, you had a bloody pussy in the dryer. 
[02:39:00]  Okay, I didn't say that.  You did.  But it was hot.  It was hot.  It was a cat, and it was bleeding, of course.  He was gasping for air, and I ran downstairs, got my husband and our three children, and I  came up, and my husband called the vet, and he said, well, cool the cat down.  So we brought it outside and proceeded to pour cold water over it.  We were pouring cold water down its throat.  I mean, anything we could do.  And you felt that was good, being a veterinarian?  Well, let me tell you, at the moment, I was, you know, anything went.  Rachel, I was interrupted.  I'm sorry. 
[02:39:30]  They gave me my big cup of coffee so I could make it through this mess of a radio show.  But, so you brought the cat outside, and it was heated up?  It was heated up, and we cooled it down.  Oh, so you cooled the pussy.  Well, then, stop this now.  Well, then what we did is we told the kids that the cat was going to die.  So, of course, we were all bawling.  Of course, my husband wasn't bawling, but we were all bawling.  And they were looking at you like the irresponsible bitch cat owner.  Exactly.  Like, you did this, Mom.  Right, right.  So the vet called back and said, I have an idea. 
[02:40:00]  So we rushed him in the family van to the vet, and he gave it a steroid shot, a diuretic shot, and some other kind of shot.  And within about an hour, Twinkle started kind of looking like he was going to pull through.  And he did.  Fascinating story.  It pulled through, and for the next four days, I breakfast, lunch, and dinner fed him with a syringe.  Because, of course, he couldn't move.  He couldn't walk.  He couldn't move.  He couldn't eat.  Did the doctor have to shave your little pussy?  Oh, stop this now.  What?  I'm talking about the cat.  Now, the doctor did say. 
[02:40:30]  I'm not the one to throw him in the dryer, Rachel.  You are.  All right.  I don't know what you call them in Wisconsin.  We call them pussies here in New York.  Right.  Kitties here.  Kitties.  Kitties.  Kittens.  Cats.  So he didn't have to shave down the pussy?  No, he didn't.  Right.  But he gave it a shot, and he survived.  Dare we say you are.  Although his tail died, it became hard, and it died, and we had to have it amputated.  So if you'd like to make a donation to the Twinkle's Amputation Fund, it was $220.  I think you should play with yourself. 
[02:41:00]  Rachel, are you trying to say that something hard on your pussy had to be amputated?  Okay.  Now I'm going to be silent.  I'm just asking.  You said that the tail was hard.  That is correct.  It was on the pussy, and it had to be amputated, right?  That is correct.  Oh, ho.  That's correct.  And it left you with a mangled pussy, I dare say.  That's right.  That's right.  That's awesome.  Mm-hmm.  Now Twinkle's is okay?  Well, Twinkle's, you know, his ears are, like, burned off. 
[02:41:30]  Now, one of them, I think one of them is going to make it.  One of them is, like, kind of curled up like a potato chip, and it's kind of ready to chip off.  It's formed and probably is going to lead a horrible life of pain.  It looks like a lynx now.  It looks like a lynx because there's no tail.  So you're suggesting if people want a cat that looks like a lynx, you just throw them in the dryer?  I didn't say that.  Well, you did it.  You didn't have to say it.  Hey, Fred on line 9 wants to know if the lynx catcher in your dryer was full of pussy hair.  Oh, my goodness.  Good question.  No comment on that one.  Although, I did put a bounce sheet in it. 
[02:42:00]  Oh, is that the joke you're telling now at your cat's expense?  There you go.  That's funny.  It smells great.  Third joke here.  Now, how many lives do you think your pussy went through?  I think you used up about eight and a half.  Eight and a half?  I think you used up about eight and a half.  Half left.  Got a half of life left.  I think put them in the washer ought to take care of that whole life.  Well, Rachel, you and your pussy are quite famous today in New York City.  I guess, yeah.  And it looks like you've got a lovely daughter.  I see.  Oh, she's great.  It looks like it's Sarah with the pre-washed pussy. 
[02:42:30]  There you go.  It sounded like they were in the paper today.  Yep.  How about that?  Does it say that?  It's Sarah with the pre-washed pussy.  Whoa.  What happened?  Rachel?  Yes.  I'm still here.  I'm sort of afraid to start talking again.  Why?  This is how we do our show.  I'm the mother of three children.  You know.  You put them in the dryer?  They're in school, so they're not hearing them.  My infant crawled into the dryer.  But you kind of hurt our feelings. 
[02:43:00]  This is how we do our radio show.  Oh, I'm teasing.  That's okay.  You guys are doing a great job.  We're just trying to, you know, make it in radio.  I know.  And we thought we'd have a little fun with you and your pussy.  There you go.  And now I feel like I, I don't know, might have said something bad.  Well, this went hard.  You know, I think you'd feel better if you'd make a donation to the Twinkle's Recovery Fund.  Are you insane?  Are you really trying to get money for Twinkle?  No, but this did cost us quite a lot of money.  Well, you should pay for it.  I know.  What's the stupidity? 
[02:43:30]  Why should other people have to pay for it?  I'm happy to pay because this is our beloved family pack.  We don't pay for pussy around here.  He's worth this and more.  Rachel, why are you making money off your pussy?  I'm not making money.  What the hell?  Poor cat.  Unbelievable.  She's actually trying to turn a dime.  She was a whore.  And how the hell do you make money off a mangled pussy?  Right.  You're horrible.  You're a horrible woman.  What kind of money do you want for that cat?  Oh, yeah.  What kind of money? 
[02:44:00]  Yeah.  How much are you trying to scrape off?  220 bucks.  If all of your listeners maybe sent 50 cents to the Twinkle's Recovery Fund, we could get  this thing paid for.  Hey, you wouldn't happen to have an email address, would you?  I do.  That would help.  That would help because all of our listeners would be behind little Twinkle.  Yes, they would.  I'll give it to you afterwards.  Well, this is your opportunity.  We have a few listeners.  It is in New York.  I mean, we're in last place, but we're trying to do good radio every day. 
[02:44:30]  Yeah.  There's somebody listening to this.  Yeah.  What's your email address, Rachel?  I don't know.  I think I lost it.  Here it is.  You want money?  Yeah.  You know how many pet lovers we have listening to us?  Do you have some pet lovers?  How many sending money is through my email address?  They'll write you and ask you where they can send you.  How about if they send it to your radio station?  Rachel, let me tell you.  You give them the address of your radio station.  Rachel, we don't have time for that.  And I'll tell you why we want your email address, okay?  You ask the question.  We want to make sure you're safe. 
[02:45:00]  We're not just going to give out an address on the air.  Right.  Let's see if you give out the email, then people, you know, write you, and then you give them the address.  I'll just give you guys afterwards.  And if you really want to give it out, you can give it out.  But I'll give it to you guys afterwards.  All right.  I'm too scared.  You know, I'm the mother of three.  Three little children?  Three little precious children.  Three children.  And a great husband.  Mm-hmm.  Okay.  Yeah.  I'm good.  So what's Twinkles doing today?  Twinkles is lounging around the house.  I left this morning.  I had done an interview in California.  You know, the amazing thing is that his brain is 100% there. 
[02:45:30]  How do you know?  I mean, picture yourself tumbling in a dryer for him as 50 minutes on high heat.  I mean, would your brain be there?  You don't know.  And his brain is there.  You don't know if the brain is there.  You're probably...  Well, he's back to his old behaviors.  You're probably your pussy's brain.  He's back to his old behaviors.  I hear you were just trying to imitate a stunt that you saw on Jackass.  Is that true?  Because I was...  That was it.  That show was off the air.  No.  Horrible.  No.  I had no idea the cat had crawled in the dryer. 
[02:46:00]  But, you know, I learned my lesson now.  I check my dryer many times before I do any kind of laundry.  I'm kind of paranoid in the laundry room now.  Hey, do you have...  Is your pussy fixed?  Yes, it is.  Oh.  Yeah.  But he still pretends like he's not fixed.  Is it he?  You know, yeah, it's a he.  Did it burn anything off?  No, things are still working.  He's there.  That's horrible.  I know.  What a horrible story.  I know.  Well, we want to thank you for doing this interview with us.  Well, sure.  No problem. 
[02:46:30]  Um...  Yeah.  I hope it was fun for you.  It was fun.  Okay.  What did that little pussy smell like when it came out of the dryer?  Mountain spring air.  Really?  That's...  I think that was the bounce...  And he sat a cling.  Hey, Rachel.  We can only drink, you know?  Oh, my gosh.  You know, we got to the vet, and the first thing the vet said is,  Well, did he shrink?  Oh, no.  We were crying.  And the vet says, Well, did it shrink?  I guess it was a vet humor.  That's a funny vet.  I know.  Vet humor, yes.  That's Dr. Wayne Griffin. 
[02:47:00]  And give that email address out one more time.  For who?  For you.  For the listeners.  Okay.  Hang up the phone, and then I'll give it to you.  Hang up the phone?  We're...  Hang up.  Okay.  I'll give it to you.  Go ahead.  All right.  W-A-L-L-A-C-R-L at shipfall, C-H-I-P-F-A-L-L-S dot, this is long now, K-1-2 dot W-I dot U-S. 
[02:47:30]  This is your email address?  I work at a school.  I'm a counselor in a school.  Oh, great.  Yep.  Don't you guys get, like, cable modems?  I don't know.  This is how the Wisconsin school system email thing works.  There's something called AOL.  Look into it.  I know.  You know, I should consider that.  I can't afford it because I'm too busy paying this bill.  Oh, she's trying to get the cash.  Well, the way you get it, give that address out one more time.  Okay.  W-A-L-L-A-C-R-L at shipfall, C-H-I-P-F-A-L-L-S dot, K-12 dot, W-I dot U-S. 
[02:48:00]  Did you have to explain to your students about the tragedy of your little pussy?  Oh, you know, I'm a drug counselor.  Oh, you are?  I am.  What grade do you teach?  Well, I'm a counselor in high school.  I work with freshman, sophomore, junior, senior.  What kind of drugs are the high school kids doing these days?  Oh, you know.  We're a little out of pots.  Are you?  They're doing the E?  They are.  They like the E, right?  A lot of alcohol, a lot of pot, and then all those other drugs. 
[02:48:30]  You know what a good buzz is?  No.  You don't hop in a dryer for 15 minutes.  I've heard that.  You will be spinning.  I'm thinking you were on the E to allow you to get trapped in a dryer.  I'm clean.  For how long?  Oh, you know, I've never been chemically dependent.  But I actually am a teetolder, and I've had any kind of drug, even including alcohol,  for about 18 years I'm sober.  What was the last drug you did?  Ah, margarita.  That's not a drug.  Well, technically, alcohol's a drug.  Yeah, yeah.  You're a light man.  Well, I don't know. 
[02:49:00]  Try some 1847.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Do you really want to open up that can of worms with me?  Yeah, yeah.  Do you?  Well, I mean, there are more people with alcohol problems in the United States than any other  drug combined.  Hey, you can go ask yourself.  Don't you agree?  I mean, most kids start out with cigarettes, and they go to alcohol, then pot, and other drugs.  So it kind of is, starts out by the way.  Well, you know, we've got to thin the herd, though.  And coming from a woman that put her cat in the dryer?  Yeah, I'll take that advice.  I know. 
[02:49:30]  I've been waiting for this.  Stone sober.  I know.  I'm sober.  All right.  I did it with a sober mind.  Okay.  Rachel Waller.  All righty.  I'm sure our listeners will send you plenty of cash.  Nothing.  You lose.  You guys have a great day.  You're a dancer.  And we're glad your pussy's doing well.  I am, too.  Okay.  Okay.  Bye.  Talk to you later.  Bye-bye.  There she goes.  Rachel Waller.  Rachel Waller.  Owner of Twinkle's the Miracle Cat.  The Miracle Pussy.  She must have been... 
[02:50:00]  All right.  Is that wrong?  Yeah, good.  Good interview.  See, that's a good interview right there.  Nice.  With the new chick.  You better not have dumped out of that.  I was talking about a cat the whole damn time.  Of course.  What would they dump?  We'd be irresponsible if we took any of the phone calls on the phone screen right now.  Right.  No one has pet roosters.  All right.  Let's take a break.  We'll be back.  Give us a call.  212-757-1027.  I can't even believe these morons. 
[02:50:30]  He's a disgusting little man.  What a douchebag.  Greenwrecked radio.  Ben Barnbrook.  This is sicker than faces of death.  1827.  WNEW.  Anthony, we are live on the radio once again from the WOW Sports 2 and the WOW Road Trip.  I think he liked his first hour with that woo-woo.  Every time he's talking to me, it's really starting us great on all of our terms. 
[02:51:00]  He's insulting me now, Anthony.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Dan was just writing down something on a piece of paper about the luxury coach that we have,  that we're working with here.  And Stinky turns and goes, what's Dan doing now?  Signing his own autograph?  To Dan from Dan.  Like, Stinky is bitching at management.  It's hysterical.  It's complete anarchy on this bus today.  He's out of control. 
[02:51:30]  Oh.  Just give him a few drinks and he'll speak his mind.  No problem.  This is all the stuff he's wanted to say for the last year, year and a half.  Anthony, we're on Coachman Luxury Transportation.  It's a company from Long Island.  They have a website, which is coachmanlimo.com.  What the hell's going on outside the window?  We are right now looking at, I believe, is that a Connie?  Is that a Lincoln Confidential? 
[02:52:00]  Up on the guardrail at the toll booth, sitting up on two wheels, up on the guardrail.  You've got to love Friday afternoon.  Must have been a happy hour trip.  That's very nice.  Hey, we are almost on the DWB, Anthony, as we make our way to Long Island, our final stop,  on this mess of a promotion we call the WOW Road Trip.  You know, when we decided to do this, we had 12 locations we wanted in one afternoon.  We started at noon today.  I think we've done, like, three locations. 
[02:52:30]  But you know what it is.  Where we went to stop, it would have went a lot quicker.  But it started when we went to the Bean Post.  A lot of cool people there.  We hung a little longer than we wanted to.  Then we got to Paramus.  Oh, my God.  Insanity prevailed.  And we stayed there quite a while.  Traffic now.  It's Friday night.  We expected this, but we believe this coach flew.  So I've got to tell you, the people at Coachman Luxury Transportation, 
[02:53:00]  we thought you had flying buses.  It's the 21st century, for God's sake.  Where's the flying cars like?  We saw the Jets.  But, no, we're stuck in traffic.  But we're going to get to Long Island, and that will be our final stop.  We want to see everybody out there.  We want it to be sicker than it was at Paramus.  Impossible!  I know.  I think he's a little bummed because he saw the gas gate,  and we think we might have to pour some of this vodka into the tank. 
[02:53:30]  Wow!  He's ripping me off of that dough, I think.  Oh, he might even do it just a tad better.  He sounds angry when he gets drunk.  I like that.  He's a happy drunk.  I love that.  And the best part is, Ted is, like, really proud of Sticky.  Aren't you, Ben?  Aren't you, Ben?  I haven't thought I was here today that someone would have managed to respect them to myself.  Oh, it looks like we lost him. 
[02:54:00]  You know, we're going to start this commercial break.  We'll come back.  Hopefully, the guys will be back on the air.  Hang out.  It's the Opie and Anthony Wow Caravan Roadshow.  Afternoon.  Opie and Anthony's Wow Road Trip on WNEW.  Pinnacle Horned Goat Wheat is the official sponsor of today's Wow Caravan.  Anthony, I want to thank Pinnacle Horned Goat Wheat for helping us out with this Wow Road Trip, right? 
[02:54:30]  I've got to tell you, the people of Pinnacle, very cool with this road trip.  They've been handing out a sample.  And if I remember, at what location in Jersey was that, that a young African-American gentleman sold probably 200 packets of Pinnacle Horned Goat Wheat,  which he would probably sell as some form of X or whatever in a local club.  So we've got to thank the people of Pinnacle Horned Goat Wheat.  They supported us during this thing.  Gave us a hell of a lot of Horned Goat Wheat. 
[02:55:00]  And I see people effing on the street behind this bus.  Just from, and yes, Stinky is one of them.  Pinnacle Horned Goat Wheat.  You want to get your hands on it, go to GMC and get some.  Call them up 1-800-899-5323.  1-800-899-5323.  Pinnacle Horned Goat Wheat.  Do the weed, and you will succeed.  Prepare yourself for Godsmack.  Prepare yourself for Keftone.
