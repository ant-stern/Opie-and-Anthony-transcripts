<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, employing consistently vulgar and offensive humor throughout.  The show began with crude jokes, including fart jokes and sexually suggestive comments, before diving into a discussion about the prevalence of Jewish holiday time off in workplaces, laced with offensive stereotypes and speculation about Jewish influence in various industries.  Their understanding of Jewish holidays like Yom Kippur and Rosh Hashanah was demonstrably limited. This segued into a furious rant about the NFL referee lockout, particularly the controversial ending of a Green Bay Packers game.  The hosts used highly vulgar language to express their anger at the NFL and its handling of the situation, discussing its impact on gamblers and the lack of player or fan outrage.  A caller provided insight into the referees' pension contributions.  This segment included commentary on celebrity and political Twitter reactions to the lockout, often satirized by the hosts, and concluded with a discussion of technological advancements in sports, including a humorous digression about a robotic cheetah.  Multiple callers contributed to the discussion on both the religious and NFL topics, with one caller, Larry, receiving significant ribbing for calling Sam Roberts "Hollywood."

The show continued with a nonsensical discussion about "wheelie legs" and a fictional "Future Jimmy," before shifting to a co-host's viral video (over 1.6 million YouTube views, featured on Worldstar Hip Hop), and their frustration at Sirius XM's lack of promotion.  This led to criticism of the company's perceived laziness and incompetent web department.  The hosts then discussed Bill Burr's appearance on Conan O'Brien, followed by a vulgar rant against Steve Jobs and his presentation style.  A significant portion focused on a viral video of a woman hula hooping, analyzed with highly vulgar and sexually explicit language by the hosts and studio guest Sam Roberts.  They attempted to identify the woman and music in the video.  The segment concluded with discussion of Madonna's comments about Barack Obama, and a scathing review of Lady Gaga's restaurant, Joanne, using highly offensive language.

The next segment began with criticism of a singer's performance, focusing on her age and perceived corniness.  This transitioned into a discussion of a controversial, vandalized NYC subway ad criticizing jihadists, leading to a conversation about political correctness and hypocrisy surrounding welfare and minority groups.  The hosts mocked a Twitter user, Lisa DeMarc, for her reaction to the hula hooping video, speculating about her appearance based on her profile picture.  They then discussed a video of Lil Wayne giving a deposition, followed by an interview with Steven Van Zandt, promoting The Rascals' reunion tour.  The conversation covered The Rascals' history, *Lilyhammer*, Van Zandt's experiences with Bruce Springsteen (including an anecdote about being ejected from a reserved table), his work on *The Sopranos* (including his perspective on Tony Soprano's fate), and playing with Paul McCartney (including an incident where their performance was cut short due to a curfew violation).  Multiple musical interludes occurred, including discussions of "Creep" cover versions (praising Homeless Mustard's) and Jack White's "Evil" (a Bruce Springsteen cover), prompting discussion of Springsteen's extensive catalog.  Van Zandt’s charitable work was also mentioned.  The segment ended with a children’s song about body parts and a mention of a Sopranos-themed tattoo.

The show continued with a discussion of the death of Danny Williams ("It's the Most Wonderful Time of the Year"), followed by a recounting of how they successfully tricked Steven Van Zandt and Bruce Springsteen with false information about a Springsteen song.  A substantial portion dealt with Halloween, with offensive racial stereotypes and slurs used during jokes about trick-or-treaters.  One host described his plan to use a helicopter to deter trick-or-treaters.  Comedian "Foot" then promoted his shows with rambling plugs, followed by a host's lengthy, crude account of an uncomfortable dinner with his much younger girlfriend's parents.  This was followed by discussions about hair, a costly haircut, a "brown list" of unhygienic coworkers, and the workplace atmosphere, culminating in a discussion about using lye (and lime) to dispose of bodies, referencing John Wayne Gacy.  Foot, Ashley (a part-time intern), and Roland were in the studio during this segment, and several callers phoned in.

The final excerpt began with a further discussion of using lye (mistakenly lime) to dispose of a body, transitioning to a story about a broken door and a repairman covered in cranberry juice.  Ashley, initially uncomfortable with the morbid humor, later discussed her career and 1.7 million YouTube views, while a conflict arose between Ashley and Roland about credit for a video.  A caller, Sammy, requested autographed books from Jimmy, who agreed but abruptly hung up after receiving instructions.  More crude jokes and teasing between the hosts and Ashley ensued, culminating in an on-air campaign to help her find a better Twitter handle.  Much of the broadcast centered on Roland’s role as a photographer, particularly his upcoming shoot with *The Carol Burnett Show*, leading to extended discussion of *The Carol Burnett Show*, Richard Pryor, Vicky Lawrence, and other celebrities like Art Garfunkel and Jack White.  The show concluded with discussion of Roland’s celebrity photography experiences and anticipation for the Carol Burnett shoot.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Welcome to the R.B. and Earth show.  What ever before has one radio show been so extreme?  So vulgar.  I'll fucking shove my face up a chick's ass in a second.  Someone said we curse a lot, do we?  I have no idea if we do.  So flatulent. 
[00:00:30]  Who just farted?  I did, but I didn't know it stopped.  Like rotten eggs and sewage.  Oh, wow, thank you.  I can't believe that us sitting around like this is actually a radio show.  It's not going to get any better than this.  Are we on the air?  No, we are.  Oh, okay.  Point simply, the greatest show in the history of broadcasting.  All in every day, that's what I say.  You guys having a good time or what?  Yeah!  Rules are destroyed. 
[00:01:00]  And conventions burn the crowd.  Would you like to make a fucking tiger?  With Opie, the destroyer.  Just pay us, you assholes.  I will continue.  Anthony, the rage.  Shut the fuck up.  Come to my pool and drown in it.  And Jim Norton, lover of the transgender.  Every time a transsexual walks in the room, party horn should go off.  Surprise!  It's the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:01:30]  Strap in, dicks.  This one's gonna hurt.  Double guns, bitch.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Is this one of those Jew days?  Whoa.  It's a Jew day, right?  Well, I would say a Jewish holiday.  Yeah, it's a Jew day.  All I do is go to the B&H website.  And if you can't order anything, you know it's a Jewish holiday. 
[00:02:00]  My camera's broken.  I don't know when I could go down there and get it fixed.  I have no idea.  Not today!  I have no idea.  When are they open?  Like, for an hour and a half after lunch or something?  Yeah.  Three days a week?  I don't know.  How are they in business when half the time they're not even open?  No, it's a Jew day.  I don't get the Jew day.  That sounds offensive.  Does it?  Yeah.  I don't know.  A Jew day?  Yeah.  Jewish holiday is the way I think they'd like it said. 
[00:02:30]  Well.  Ah.  Well.  My whole life.  I don't understand why they get.  We get the holidays off and we don't.  Da da da da da.  Ha ya ya ya ya ya.  Why?  It's nice, isn't it?  You alright?  I don't know what this is.  You alright?  I'm doing a Jewish.  You alright?  I'm singing a Jewish anthem.  Oh.  But explain to me why our entire lives, going way back to school.  Yeah.  Where the Jewish people get their special holidays off and we don't. 
[00:03:00]  They take our holidays off.  Didn't we used to get it in school?  I don't know, man.  I thought we got the Jewish holidays off.  I guess it depends on where you are from.  Long Island.  I remember we used to get it.  Yeah.  Alright.  So why does half this place get a day off and we don't?  How does that work?  Hmm.  Can I just start saying I'm Jewish so I get to take this day off?  It would be nice.  I'm serious.  Yeah.  It is kind of nice not having them around.  I'll give you that.  Oh yeah.  No doubt.  No doubt. 
[00:03:30]  Why?  I mean, we kind of do win on the Jewish holidays because we've got to deal with those guys.  Is their contract vacation days, sick days, and Jew days?  And Jewish holiday days?  And Jewish holidays?  Look, I'm just fucking trying to throw comedy out there.  Relax, everybody.  If you notice, I am not chiming in at all.  Why?  Are you Jewish?  No, I don't fuck with Jewish people.  Oh, I love the show business.  I love the Jews, but I'm just trying to figure this out, though.  In their contract, they got a separate line for their Jewish days? 
[00:04:00]  I don't think it's something in the contract.  I think it's a wink.  It's a wink.  During the time where you're negotiating a deal, you give a little wink.  A wink.  It's that, hey, I know it's you.  Yeah.  Don't worry.  I like the Jews.  I got some Jewish friends.  My God.  Right?  I'm surrounded by the Jews.  It's nice.  Anyway, so happy Yom Kippur, Yom Kippur.  Is it Yom Kippur?  Some say it is Kippur. 
[00:04:30]  As a kid, you'd always say Yom Kippur.  I think it's Yom.  It's Kippur.  Kippur.  Kippur, yes.  I never know.  Here's how I know it's a Jewish holiday is if I call my managers and it's like a Monday  or Tuesday afternoon and I get the company voicemail.  Yeah.  I'm like, what the?  And I'll say, John, where were you?  He's like, oh, it was Yom Kippur.  It was Rosh Hashanah.  I never know when they are.  Of course not.  I only know when I call and no one answers.  It's a really strange secret thing they do.  Yeah. 
[00:05:00]  See, you think it's secret.  Oh, my God.  It's kind of sneaky because we don't know when these Jewish holidays pop up.  All of a sudden, I know when I leave my apartment and there's absolutely no one on the street.  There's no traffic.  Then you realize, oh, okay, I guess I do live in a very Jewish city.  You realize how many Jewish people run Manhattan.  You can get a cab.  No one's bumping into you on the sidewalks.  I don't know.  So, happy Yom Kippur to the Jewish folks. 
[00:05:30]  Are they allowed to listen to the radio today?  If someone turns it on?  Is that how it works?  I don't know.  Is that where they can't touch electricity, Kenny?  Kenny, aren't you Jewish?  Kenny's Jewish.  Wow.  See, we got Jewish friends.  Today is the holiest day of the year.  Is it really?  Yeah.  Everybody has to fast and they have to atone for all their sins.  It's atone, really?  Out of the flow. 
[00:06:00]  That means a lot of these guys are going to fucking give me some apologies today.  Nice.  Oh, man.  If they got to atone, they got to see me.  What is today?  They've done me bad.  What's today's holiest?  Is it Yom Kippur?  Yom Kippur, yes.  Why aren't you taking the day off?  Because you guys are very much more important.  You guys are my God.  Wow.  I like that.  It's a sad state of affairs.  It's a sad state of affairs.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Look, I'm just trying to get some knowledge today. 
[00:06:30]  That's all.  I don't really understand.  Yeah, today is a very holy day.  So are you working for free today?  Negative.  How many people listen to a radio show on a Yom Kippur day?  All the Gentiles.  You're not allowed to listen to radio if you're Jewish?  No, you're too busy.  You got to be in temple and you have to atone.  All day you got to be in temple?  Like from when to when? 
[00:07:00]  What is Yom Kippur and what is Rosh Hashanah?  I know they're different holidays, but I don't know.  Rosh Hashanah is the Jewish New Year.  Oh, okay.  And that happened already, right?  Yeah, last week.  That was last week?  Yeah.  How do you have back-to-back holidays?  Technically, the Jewish New Year should be the one we follow.  I mean, doesn't that go back like fucking 5,000 years?  You're asking the wrong person.  Over 5,000.  Yeah.  I think they know when the Rosh Hashanah prize is a better indication than January 1st.  Ours is better.  Ours is more festive and fun.  Oh, and ours is based on Jesus. 
[00:07:30]  Well, again, come on.  Jesus.  Every time you say Jesus, you got to do that.  You have to.  You really have to.  Too much guilt in the Jewish.  Catholics have a lot of it, but Jews even have even more guilt.  You think Jewish people have more guilt than Catholics?  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Absolutely.  Oh, my God, yeah.  The Jews embrace guilt.  Yeah.  Love it.  Yeah.  They love it, huh?  That's why they all walk around like today with a big G on their sweatshirt.  Guilt in the house.  You hear it. 
[00:08:00]  They pop it up.  They pop it up.  I don't know.  I just don't think it's fair that if you work among Jewish people, they get special days off, and we don't.  Because I really do think they sneak our days, too.  Well, they probably do, yeah.  They take our Christmas off.  All of our holidays.  Another holiday next week, Sukkot.  Oh, that's.  I know it's.  I have that on the bottom of my car.  It prevents rust.  Oh, I have it next to my suhat.  Let me tell you what.  Double mittens.  Suhat. 
[00:08:30]  Let me tell you what that one is.  See, I know a little bit.  That's the one where you build, like, plywood structures outside, and you have to live out there for a little bit.  The Sukkot?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Kenny?  Yes.  Isn't that true?  You're absolutely correct.  Why do you have to go outside?  And why do they build the plywood things?  There's one in my neighborhood.  Don't they sell them?  Look it up.  Huh?  They sell those things.  Like, you could just go and buy this, a little sukkah. 
[00:09:00]  Is there a little table and chairs in that thing?  And you sit there and go, hey.  I got a temple in my neighborhood.  And, man, do they.  It must be a special temple because there are cops outside this one all the time.  New York City.  Yeah.  This one.  Oh, boy.  This one especially, though, all the time.  Yeah.  And they have sort of a backyard area, and they start building the plywood things.  The plywood things.  Well, that's what it looks like.  It's just a bunch of plywood.  Yeah. 
[00:09:30]  And then underneath, because they leave a few holes by accident, and you peek in, and you  see that they're just kind of hanging out, enjoying themselves.  It kind of looks like fun.  It's a feast.  You eat a lot, right?  I believe so.  Because you're starving from fasting today, right?  It's been a long time since I was in a temple.  Yeah?  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  You're not practicing?  No.  I'm not, like, orthodox or conservative.  How about just your run of the mill?  A guy that respects his religion? 
[00:10:00]  Yeah.  I guess not.  All right.  Well, Kenny's here.  Yeah.  What are some other Jewish holidays you guys get off?  You got the...  Hanukkah?  Oh, of course, Hanukkah.  But that's...  Yeah, but of course, like, our Christmas is one day.  They have to do it for, what?  Eighteen or something?  How many days?  Eighteen.  That's the festival of lights.  Yeah, but how many days do you need?  Eight days.  Eight days the oil lasted.  Eight days.  They didn't expect it to last that long.  No.  Well, they have one day of oil.  Yeah.  See what they do?  They stretch everything out.  Stretch it out. 
[00:10:30]  We need one day.  You guys need eight.  But Voss had a great joke about that.  Yeah.  If the Jews walked a little longer, they would have had all the oil.  Yes, that's right.  She also had a great joke about it.  I was supposed to do that one.  They were close.  Yeah, if the Jews walked two more miles, we'd have all the oil.  We'd have all the oil.  That's the joke, yes.  All right.  So we learned a little bit about the Jewish holiday today.  I wish the Jews had the oil, believe me.  Oh, my God.  Great with that bite. 
[00:11:00]  I think life would be a little different, huh?  Great.  Fantastic.  How about we stop at the oil?  How about we figure something else out?  Not have to deal with those people.  Because that's not really working out for everybody.  It just seems like that sun.  It just feels like that sun, you could do something with it.  Yeah.  And I know we do a little bit with the sun, but come on.  It's right there, man.  There's got to be something so easy you could do with the sun.  And that wind thing.  I've seen the wind fields out west. 
[00:11:30]  Yeah.  They go for miles and miles and miles and miles.  It doesn't matter.  I know.  Why?  Because you can't just pull a lever and have it go into your car.  That's the biggest thing with people.  Why can't we do a little, I don't know, whirly bird thing on your car?  That'd be interesting.  Why not?  Why not?  A little whirly bird thing.  Why not?  I don't think you could generate enough power through moving to keep you moving. 
[00:12:00]  That would be something called perpetual motion.  No, you've got to park it in a windy area when you're not driving.  Oh, is that it?  And that'll recharge everything.  The Flintstones did it.  There you go.  Oh, boy.  I saw the Jetsons the other day for the first time.  Yeah.  Wow.  That was a good cartoon.  Yeah.  It really was, man.  I turned my kid on to the Jetsons.  I go, you want me to turn this off?  He goes, no.  Was it a...  No.  And it was from 1985.  What the hell is that?  Those are the terrible ones.  I guess it...  I think you're right. 
[00:12:30]  Oh, man.  But it looked like the ones I used to watch, so maybe they're just saying it's 1985, maybe  because they redid the color or something on it.  Because it looked like the original to me.  Was it a Spacely episode?  No, it was the one with the magic glasses that Judy fucking wore.  Do you know that one?  Fucking Judy.  Where she saw the future a few seconds before it happened?  Like Jimmy.  Which sees the future.  Yes, but I don't see the present.  No, you don't.  I don't see the present.  I see only the past and the future. 
[00:13:00]  My present is a two-sided mirror.  Seeing...  Stan Myers.  I don't even want to mention that name, Kevin from Connecticut.  You know who Stan Myers is.  We've done hours on Stan Myers.  Water engine guy.  Oh.  Let's not speak of him.  Next thing you know, he gets some kind of weird fucking food poisoning and he's dead after  he tells the world that he's figured it out and all we need is water.  Oh, please.  Remember that guy?  That guy.  Don't even speak of him.  Nope.  Anyway.  Well, the NFL is just a terrific fucking organization. 
[00:13:30]  Yeah.  They can't even admit their wrongs.  Nope.  NFL says replay official was, and it's in big capital letters, right, not to overturn on-field  ruling.  Not to overturn...  Well, what is wrong with these fucking organizations?  They're fucking completely...  Organizations.  They're absolute scumbags.  And they know the fans are going to do nothing.  This would be like if you were dating somebody and you fucked somebody behind her back and  she caught you and said, you fucking cheated on me. 
[00:14:00]  And you both know it happened because she saw you through the window and you said, no,  I didn't.  And you know if you keep saying, no, you didn't, she's not going to leave you.  That's the way fucking the NFL...  Hat-dump broads.  That's the way they treat their fans.  Yes.  People...  Stop going to games.  Stop watching games.  And watch how fast they fucking fix it.  But you won't stop going to games.  So why should they fix it?  I'm saying this to the fans.  Tosh had something good on Twitter last night, too.  He said, if the players just stayed home, watch how quickly they fix things.  And you know what? 
[00:14:30]  That's not far-fetched because the players have had it.  And you know...  Exactly, yeah.  I think some of these players are thinking, I could really get fucked up on this field  if the refs aren't, you know, smart enough with what's going on on the field.  So don't be surprised if something crazy happens.  I'm telling you.  Because they have had it.  And the stupid NFL just goes, nope, they were right.  Man, the more you see that play, it's so horrendously bad.  And they could have overturned it with the instant replay.  And they still saw it the other way?  That's stupid. 
[00:15:00]  12 hours after the Green Bay Packers lost a Monday night game to Seattle,  the NFL announced that Seattle wideout Golden Tate should have been flagged  for offensive pass interference on the decisive play in the end zone as time expired.  So they're admitting that part?  NFL announced that Seattle wideout.  The interference was not called and it was not a reviewable play.  Oh, okay.  Why isn't it a reviewable play?  Yeah, what is that about?  I don't know.  You can't review pass interference?  Travis would probably know more about this.  Yeah, you can, but why can't you? 
[00:15:30]  Travis knows nothing.  Furthermore, the league upheld the decision to rule Tate's reception a simultaneous catch  with Packers safety M.D. Jennings.  Which it wasn't.  By rule, the league said possession belonged to Tate.  The NFL officiating department reviewed the play Tuesday and supported the on-field call.  They're just idiots.  They're disgusting.  And also, the same as when Bud Selig wouldn't overturn that call,  they don't care if the right call is made.  They just don't give a shit.  Oh, it's part of the game.  Again, try paying for your food and not paying enough money. 
[00:16:00]  Or try paying for a ticket, but not paying for enough.  Oh, no, you're not giving the right amount.  That's not part of the game.  So why is getting the wrong fucking calls part of the game?  Look, the NFL's got a problem with the refs, obviously.  But you've got to just go, oh, wow, yeah, they blew this one.  And we're trying to figure something out as far as making the officiating better.  But, you know, we don't have any updates on that right now for you guys.  But to just back these guys after blowing this call is unbelievable.  Why is it not a reviewable play, Travis? 
[00:16:30]  They just decided it's not.  Really?  Yeah, I don't have a great answer for you because I haven't read the entire NFL rule book.  But it does seem that there are some plays that are reviewable and some plays that just aren't reviewable.  I don't know.  If you've got that technology, I'm sure somebody that's like a massive NFL fan probably knows the reasoning behind that.  Probably because they don't want to slow down the game.  Yeah, but they're already slowing down the game.  But this would slow it down more is what I'm thinking. 
[00:17:00]  They're slowing it down with everything being sponsored.  And this is the Jeep Cherokee kick.  Like, you know, they don't mind slowing the game down for that.  I mean, in my opinion, if you're going to use instant replay, you should either use instant replay or don't use instant replay.  You know, if only two parts of a play are reviewable and the other part isn't reviewable, well, then what's the fucking point of using instant replay?  You think we get the refs back maybe too late for Sunday, but next Sunday?  Week from Sunday?  Maybe. 
[00:17:30]  From what I hear, they're still very far apart.  This is on the front page now, though.  Yeah, but I don't think, just like Jim said, the NFL doesn't care.  They know that people are going to keep watching games.  I don't want to watch Thursday's Ravens game, but I know I'm going to because that's just...  You know what?  Also, people that don't watch football are going to watch because they're going to want to see the fucked up plays.  That's what Sam was talking about.  Sam's a big football fan now.  But I really...  Oh, are you?  Now, yeah.  I wouldn't be surprised if the players do something.  Yeah, let the players do something.  I think it's going to come down to the players because, you know, people like me, I think, 
[00:18:00]  well, I'm just one guy.  I'm not going to make a difference, so I might as well just watch.  And that's what everybody else is going to think, you know?  So they're just going to keep watching and keep going to the games.  But they like...  Also, also, people, sports fans, they don't give a fuck how much they jack up the charges.  They're going to complain, and they're going to show up anyway.  So it's not just the owners being greedy scumbag.  It's people never saying, fuck you to these dumb sports.  Time Warner just got Red Zone.  The second I got the email Saturday morning, I gave them my $6. 
[00:18:30]  I said, here, take my money.  Take more money.  I want to watch Red.  Yeah.  I was watching someone talking about this this morning, and they said, even if we organized  a boycott where 10 million fans boycotted the NFL, it wouldn't make a lick of difference.  It's like everybody says...  That's how much money they've already made.  After a strike and a lockout, people are like, you know, if no one goes to the games, and  then they're packed.  Yeah.  Everyone to go to the game.  I'll tell you, though, they're squabbling about what is not that much money with the 
[00:19:00]  referees.  I think it boils down to like $60,000 per team every over five years or something.  Yeah, they're such scumbags, these guys.  Who runs a SiriusXM?  I heard it's $3.5 million for the year or something per team.  Per team?  No, no, no.  I think it's $60,000 per team over five years.  That's it?  No, no, no.  Come on.  That's definitely not.  Flaherty said that, too.  No, I think it's per game or something.  Oh, but we all know $3 million's nothing.  A mere bag of shells, Twitter people. 
[00:19:30]  $3 million's a lot to people that don't have...  Shut up.  Well, people just keep enjoying it.  They hammered me yesterday.  Like, whatever, dude.  Yes, of course they did.  Why don't you go outside?  You're missing a whole fucking world.  You're really bothered by what I said.  Relax.  There's something wrong with you.  All you football fans out there, keep enjoying the dick in your ass from the owners, and they're  going to keep giving it to you.  Well, hey.  You know what?  I'm one of those guys.  He makes it sexy.  I'll watch.  Not me.  I'll fucking watch. 
[00:20:00]  That's the thing.  I'm guilty.  We love the sport too much to just not watch.  Like, if I know that there's 12 games on right now, like, I'm going to watch it, you know?  Well, why not?  But if you love the sport, then take some time from it.  He's up this morning.  Let's get the mad dog to talk about this.  Ah, Chris Vuzo.  He's going to be on MSNBC.  Coming up on the morning, Joe.  Chris Vuzo.  He's going to be on MSNBC very soon.  Can we get a phone call into him?  Yeah, I'll talk to Roland.  They're going to be talking football.  I heard he was classic.  He had a good rant about this whole thing.  Sure he is.  He's a smart guy.  My ex-ponder falling asleep. 
[00:20:30]  I think you've got to watch, though, because something ridiculous might happen here.  If this continues, something ridiculous is going to happen.  You know what's going to happen?  Especially when these teams start realizing they don't have a shot at the playoffs, they  might agree on something and go, look, let's make a fucking statement right now.  Let's take a knee every fucking play.  Have people been calling Francesa and saying, like, hey, those guys are asleep at the wheel?  I think they're snoozing out there on the field.  Get it?  And, you know, I've done this for many years. 
[00:21:00]  Nothing is going to happen.  Nothing.  That's the thing.  People are waiting for what's not going to come.  I don't know, man.  Nothing.  I don't know.  And if it does happen, you catch it on ESPN.  There's something a-brewing out there.  I don't know.  Maybe nothing this week, but I'm telling you, a few more weeks of this shit, I have a strong  feeling you're going to see something that you haven't seen in a while.  I don't know what it is, but I think it's something.  You're going to see the players show up.  You're going to see the refs make bad calls until they decide to get the thing, and you're  going to see every seat filled, no matter how much people complain, no matter how much 
[00:21:30]  the owners fuck them, no matter how much they put these seat charges on.  Hey, it costs money just to own the license.  They're scumbags.  There's a line of 20 people for every seat.  You can knock out 20 stadiums full of people that decided, I'm not going to put up with  it, and there's always going to be somebody else.  Literally, as a stand-up, the reason I work on material is because if I don't, people aren't  going to laugh, and they're not going to come.  If I had a laugh track on stage, and I knew I was going to kill every show, you'd think 
[00:22:00]  I'd work on new material?  I wouldn't give a fuck.  Exactly.  I would do the same shit, and people would go, he's doing the same shit, but it's like,  I know I'm oversold on all my shows.  Who cares?  Have you guys been following the Twitter on this?  No.  It's been great.  What is that?  Is that good?  Is there more?  Yeah, they started-  Is this a new one?  I think somebody started plugging Nick and Artie's show and mentioning that he was sleeping  on the air.  Okay, we'll go to that in a second.  Packers guard Josh Sitton, I think that's how you say his name, he tweeted, the NFL needs 
[00:22:30]  to come to Green Bay and apologize to us for fucking us.  These refs are bums.  And then you got the Packers guard Josh, oh, another one from him, he says, Golden Tate  is full of shit too, saying he clearly caught that is embarrassing.  Well, Golden Tate, what's he going to do?  Fucking jokers.  A lot of the players are more upset at him than they are at the refs because he's saying  that he caught it and he knows he didn't catch it.  But he had, not one player, and this is where the players should shut the fuck up, not  one player would stand up and go, no, no, no, right, whoa, hold on, wrong call, 
[00:23:00]  I didn't have it.  Yeah, but even though, like, now, like, they can't be overturned.  They're not going to overturn it.  And so everybody's just like, you're being a chump.  Yeah, the NFL said we're not overturning this.  And then Barack Obama tweeted, of course, it's the most boring one of all of them.  NFL fans on both sides of the aisle hope the ref's lockout is settled soon.  And then he signs it, B.O.  Out of a limb, that one.  Bo.  Well, what he should be doing, instead of fucking blaming films for violence in Islam, 
[00:23:30]  just blame Muslims and stop tweeting about this dumb shit.  Yeah.  How about you don't tweet about football when embassies are burning?  Yeah, and Bill Clinton is actually saying what you should be saying.  It's embarrassing.  It really is amazing that the Clinton years are now the paradise years of this country.  Everyone looks back.  What a legacy that president has now.  Amazing.  The fucking blowjob president is looked at like, oh, my God, remember the good old days?  Yeah.  I love him.  I love him.  Everything he says makes sense now. 
[00:24:00]  It's fucking amazing.  Samuel Jackson tweeted, okay, totally time for the cheap-ass owners to pony up.  These refs are in over their heads, obviously.  And I will strike down upon me with great vengeance and furious anger.  And then Chris Rock, he writes, if you're holding your baby and I walk up and hug it,  according to the NFL replacement refs, you have to give me your baby.  Look at old Chris Rock.  And then you got Paul Ryan and Romney talking about it. 
[00:24:30]  Oh, that's got to be comfortable.  And I know Romney's your guy, but this fucking guy can't talk about shit that's going on out there.  I bet you he didn't see the game, and I bet you he didn't even see the play.  He's every man of me.  Come on.  Is he?  He's every man.  Just a regular Joe.  And he's got a new tell.  When he doesn't know about something and he gets nervous that someone's going to call him out on it,  he laughs a lot.  Does he chuckle?  Look here, right here. 
[00:25:00]  Right here.  Listen to this.  What would you do about those referees in the NFL?  Would you know what that means?  What are you talking about?  What?  What?  Oh, no.  What?  That's what he's doing right there.  Look, I don't expect him to know everything.  I guarantee he has no idea what the country's talking about with this thing.  Someone had to, like, brief him and go, look, man, you might need 30 seconds on this because they might ask you.  Oh, shit. 
[00:25:30]  Yeah, what?  Holy shit, what?  What would you do about those referees in the NFL?  Would you order them back to work?  I'd still like to see some experienced referees with NFL experience come back out of the NFL playing fields.  Paul Ryan called those refs out today.  Are you glad that he did that?  What did he say?  Because I don't know.  Jinx.  Paul Ryan.  Who's that guy?  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  That's very funny.  What a terrible answer. 
[00:26:00]  He kept saying NFL.  NFL.  NFL playing fields.  NFL fields.  There's a ball involved.  Hey, man.  Yeah, a lot of blacks tackling.  How far is ignorance goes is hilarious that the ha, ha, ha translates directly to what are you talking about?  I studied this shit in college.  This is semantics.  I'm telling you.  It's so great.  This is a tell.  He has no idea or he feels like he's not informed enough to even answer that question.  He's probably thinking as he's fake laughing like that.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Yes.  Right.  Paul Ryan called those refs out today. 
[00:26:30]  Are you glad that he did that?  That's just fine.  Paul was very angry that the Green Bay Packers, he believes won, and the referees took it away from them.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Oh, God.  Oh, no.  You want to stick.  That's not that the president should know football.  Oh, but that's a stiff.  That's why I don't care what he sounds like because everybody gets caught up in that.  And to be honest, that doesn't make or break a good president.  But he's a stiff. 
[00:27:00]  He might be the best president ever.  He's a stick in the mud.  He stinks at fucking talking about football.  He's a stiff.  Who cares?  You know what?  No one's going to be the best president ever.  No.  No.  I'll tell you who it might be.  Those days are a long order.  Chris Van Dugvuso is on the TV right now.  Oh.  We're talking about the get a ball.  One of the most professional sports is the commissioners who used to be, years ago, strong  and independent.  Do you think she hates the segment? 
[00:27:30]  Oh, God.  He hasn't done that.  He doesn't like Roselle would have done this.  Oh, Stern.  Stern.  Stern.  He's on top of it.  Stern is.  Again, think about it for a second.  The NFL is making a mockery of these regular season games.  Coaches are acting poorly.  The players are barbaric now.  They're going crazy because they know they can get away with everything.  Go crazy.  You got one referee putting his hands up.  Another guy is saying it's an interception.  Another one touching the shield.  So, by the way, we're completely out of line. 
[00:28:00]  When you win a tainting game, let's not make it sound like that you won the Super Bowl.  Walk off the field quietly.  Thank the Lord that you got to win and move on.  Pete Carroll, Golden Tate, shut up.  Nobody wants to hear it, for goodness sake.  And I like what the Packers did.  McCracky didn't say anything.  Aaron Rodgers, after the game, was very, you know, this week got robbed, but he was pretty  good about it.  Green Bay handled this superbly, unlike Belichick, who did a bad job.  But, again, think about it.  $9 billion.  This is pennies we're talking about.  It's $9 billion. 
[00:28:30]  Pennies.  And you're getting...  I'm on the show.  You're getting...  It's just something that makes sense.  Governor, what are they doing?  That's hilarious.  I'm on this show.  You wouldn't have me on if the refs were fucking us up.  Hello, Drew Boogie.  Hi, Drew.  What's up, Drew?  How about painted boogie?  Take us out, you fucking incompetent fucksucker.  Come on.  Oh, this guy is pretty much defending the NFL as well.  Phil in North Dakota.  Phil?  Yes. 
[00:29:00]  Phil Connors?  What's going on, guys?  Yeah, I just wanted to say, the NFL has to support the ruling on the field, or are they  admitting that they need the old refs back?  Yes.  Yeah, they're in a tough spot, but this got really bad, though.  But the thing is, Phil, what they're doing is wrong, just like what Bud Selig did was wrong.  These guys who just say, well, no, they were right to say that, it means they're going  to say that the refs are right no matter whether they're right or wrong, so they're full of  shit.  Right.  They're not right.  Right.  Oh, yeah, absolutely.  No, that's a good point, though. 
[00:29:30]  That's why they are doing that.  Thank you, Phil.  Yeah, but Phil, we know why they're doing it.  Yeah.  Because they don't want to admit they're wrong.  But I don't know.  Well, they're in negotiation with these refs.  I mean, they can't shoot themselves in the foot.  But they are shooting themselves in the foot by letting the game be reffed by people who  are not good at it.  The regular referees make enough bad calls.  These guys are genuinely fucking terrible.  Terrible.  Oh, yeah, definitely.  I agree.  All right.  We lost the Vegas guy, but I heard some bookies were giving money back. 
[00:30:00]  Is that true?  There was at least one online sportsbook that refunded everybody that would have lost.  What kind of asshole bookie gives the money back?  I don't know.  Great bookie.  Yeah, but that'll make you put your money with that guy again.  But yeah, about 300 million changed hands because of that.  That's how much money those guys are making?  That they could just do that?  That, you know.  Well, how much do they give back, I mean?  Oh, I don't know.  That's just one specific online sportsbook.  This wasn't like a Vegas thing.  Right, right.  But yeah, about worldwide, they said about 300 million, you know, hung on that. 
[00:30:30]  Because the Packers were favored by four and a half on most books, and they would have  covered with five.  So the fuck-up cost gamblers at least $300 million?  Yeah.  Some that obviously should have won the money?  Oh, yeah.  Holy fuck.  Let's say hi to Larry in Indiana.  Hello, boys, and how you doing, Hollywood?  Hey, hey, hey.  That's my new greeting for fans.  Hey, hey, hey. 
[00:31:00]  Hollywood Sam Roberts.  Penalties are not...  Oh, you're talking about Sam?  Of course, Larry.  Oh, I think you're calling me Hollywood.  Why are you calling Sam Hollywood?  It's Larry.  Oh, please.  It's Larry.  It's my favorite caller ever.  It's Larry.  Guys, he's an after-show caller.  Sorry, Larry.  Oh, now we're getting your fans calling our show?  Hollywood sweetheart Sam Roberts.  It's like a Baba Booey.  They go to Hollywood.  It really is.  It's only eight billion times smaller.  Yes, one guy does it.  Why would they call you Hollywood?  Larry started doing it.  But, Larry, why would you call Sam Hollywood when he has nothing to do with Hollywood? 
[00:31:30]  Well, because Ron Bennington called him Hollywood Sammy Sweetheart.  So, he's Hollywood Climetime Sammy Sweetheart, the effing Roberts, the man, the legend.  I'm going to hang up on you, Larry.  You asked him.  You asked him.  I got to hang up on Larry.  You had to comment on him.  I'm sorry.  It's a terrible call.  Larry's gone.  Larry Roberts.  Larry, I was going to say that the players got a letter to the NFL saying it's an unsafe  environment.  Yeah, that's what the Players Association is doing now. 
[00:32:00]  Which means they might take it to the next step.  I'm telling you, something crazy might end up happening.  Yeah, they're not going to boycott.  They're going to show up.  They're going to fucking show up with their little helmets and they're going to do exactly  what they're told.  They're going to fucking show up.  With their chin straps.  They're not going to do a fucking thing.  They're going to put their chin straps on.  I think there's a much better chance of them boycotting than the fans.  You're right.  And there's zero chance of that.  Right.  No one is going to do a fucking thing but take a big NFL dick in their ass. 
[00:32:30]  They're actually no good.  Ow.  Ow.  How does this affect the fantasy football leagues?  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  It's got to be huge.  Did you see the article that's on the front page of the paper today that some of these  refs used to...  Oh, I think we talked about it yesterday.  Yeah, we talked about it yesterday.  The lingerie league.  Yeah, they got fired from the lingerie league.  They got fired because they were incompetent to...  Because they were retarded there.  Yeah, to ref games where women are running around in fucking lingerie.  That's classic. 
[00:33:00]  The difference is, like, if there's a judge's decision in UFC, Dana will fucking bash the  guy, even though that's the Athletic Commission and not UFC.  He was tweeting, like, bad ref decisions.  He calls them out on it.  Right.  Why can't they do the same thing with their own referees?  Right.  They just...  No, they made the right call.  No, they made the right call.  That's what you guys are supporting.  And by you guys, I mean all the fans out there.  It's fucking stupid.  A lot of people say business as usual until week six when the regular officials report.  That's Steven Tampa.  But, well, I guess the NFL will try to figure out something quick then. 
[00:33:30]  No, they won't.  No, I don't think so.  They will fucking...  Really?  Look at how they responded to this.  Wow.  I'm going to be so wrong on this, I guess.  They're not bending with what the refs want.  Even when it got to this point, they don't care.  Wow.  They don't care.  They're a corporation.  So what are they going to do?  They're a corporation.  They're fighting over $5 million.  They're a $9 billion corporation.  So they're going to get rid of all these refs.  They're going to bring in new refs, and hopefully they get up to speed.  Just keep going.  Wow.  You've seen this a million times.  There was a baseball strike. 
[00:34:00]  There's been two hockey strikes, or lockouts, rather.  They don't just say, okay.  Yeah, but I don't remember all the sports being affected to this point.  I don't think it's as bad as everybody's making it out to be.  This is the first game that you can honestly say has been affected.  Look, man.  I saw another angle with that field goal, and you're lucky with that Pats game, man.  I went through.  That fucking field goal was wide motherfucking right.  Was it wide?  Did you see the other angle?  That's a very wide angle. 
[00:34:30]  It went right through.  Another angle.  I didn't see the other angle.  Look, that was a close call, too, but not too, because now that we've seen the slow  ball.  This was not a close call.  Yeah, I know.  We see it in fast speed, maybe.  Regular speed.  But when they slowed it down, it was obvious Tate didn't come close to catch that ball.  I don't think the NFL is going to call up the refs and say, hey.  They talked yesterday.  They were scheduled to talk yesterday before this happened.  Nothing.  Nothing.  No.  Wow.  Why would they?  But again, why would they?  Like you said, you're going to watch anyway.  These people out there are all, well, I got season. 
[00:35:00]  Okay.  Then you have two choices.  Everyone's still going to go.  Do something about it, or just quietly take the dick.  But if people didn't go, believe me, they would do something.  They would absolutely react.  The guy on TV said 10 million fans could boycott, and the NFL would laugh at them.  They would laugh at that organization.  They've got record TV ratings.  They're doing better now than they've ever done.  They wouldn't laugh at them.  Look at the amount of fucking, look at the problems they're going through over the money  with the referees.  They're fucking cheapskates.  If they start losing revenue, they absolutely would do something, because that's all they give 
[00:35:30]  a fuck about.  They're fighting over like half a percent of their revenue.  They make $9 billion.  They're fighting over $5 million.  It's a lot of money.  But I mean, the fact that they're allowing this to happen.  It's only $5 million?  I don't know.  I want the real numbers.  You might be right, but that seems a little low.  I heard it was like $3 million per team.  That's not that much.  That's not it at all.  Because that would be, how many, there's 30 teams, it would be like $90 million.  They're only referees.  Yeah. 
[00:36:00]  They're fighting over about $5 million.  And mostly, yeah, and like retirement.  Find me an article.  Find me a jury.  So here's what Paul Ryan had to say.  I got to start off on something that was really troubling that occurred last night.  Did you guys watch that Packer game last night?  I mean, give me a break.  It is time to get the real rest.  Why are these guys zeros when it comes to talking about real shit? 
[00:36:30]  They're just zeros.  They're just zeros.  And it's all of them.  Obama's a stiff, obviously, too.  We all know that.  He's going to compare it to something.  Oh.  Because everyone running is a millionaire who...  They're just out of touch or something.  They're not regular.  If you watch the game with this guy, that's what it would be like.  Who talks like this?  No one.  They're not as invested in it as we are because...  Or as average fans.  So he's got to make believe he cares more?  Yes.  Like, he doesn't give a shit in the end?  If you had enough to buy...  Like, Romney has enough to buy a team. 
[00:37:00]  He's $200 million.  It's such an intangible, meaningless thing.  Like, they react to this the way you'd react if you heard someone had a problem with the bocce ball.  Right.  Like, there was a bad bocce ball call or someone in badminton made a bet.  You'd be like, what?  Who gives a fuck?  Right, right.  They're just saying things they think people want to hear.  It is time to get the real refs.  And you know what?  It reminds me of President Obama and the economy.  Of course it does.  Oh, my God. 
[00:37:30]  Oh, no.  That is so uncomfortable.  He did not just do that.  It reminds me.  Does it?  Tying it all in.  Wow.  Did it remind you of that when you, like, heard about it?  I think he was watching and he's like, that's like President Obama.  You know what?  This is good.  I could say.  And I don't know of one guy that uses the term, give me a break.  Yeah.  Who says that?  Only us when our food comes. 
[00:38:00]  Give me a break.  Oh, Jimmy.  But I'll tell you, you can feel their insincerity when they talk about this stuff.  Of course.  And that jizz bag segue, you feel it.  That's uncomfortable.  It's not coming from a sports fan.  And, I mean, if he did that as sort of like a joke, that would be all right.  Yeah.  But, you know, he's trying to make a real statement.  This is uncomfortable.  Reminds me of President Obama and the economy.  Oh, yeah.  If you can't get it right, it's time to get out. 
[00:38:30]  Yeah.  And then he goes.  Let me hear that little laugh.  Listen to his little.  That's a, I did good, right?  Yeah, yeah.  Right, right.  Everyone, you with me?  Because everybody at first is like, what?  And he goes, yeah.  If you can't get it right, it's time to get out.  That's his Tourette.  I have to think that these refs work part-time for the Obama administration and the budget office.  Oh, he's killing it.  They see the National Debt Clock staring them in the face. 
[00:39:00]  They see a debt crisis, and they just ignore and pretend it didn't even happen.  They're trying to pick the winners and losers, and they don't even do that very well.  Wow.  Wow.  Goddamn.  Wow.  Paul Ryan.  Horrendous.  He is business.  That was bad.  You know how those good comparisons?  I'll tell you why.  I'm embarrassed for this country.  These are the best guys.  That was bad.  It's embarrassing.  Whenever they try to talk to us, like one of us, they show exactly.  And I'll say that's where Clinton is so good. 
[00:39:30]  He's way above all of us as well, but he makes us feel like he likes us.  Right.  He's a fake guy, too, but he knows how to do it right.  He's better at it, yeah.  He's a much better actor.  Because he fucks the same chicks we do.  Just big fucking pears.  He does exactly what we would do.  He fucks pears.  Hey, you fatso over there by the typewriter.  Why don't you drain this cock while that fucking savage is standing in the garden?  Why don't you fucking drain my ball bag?  You know what?  We've been sort of supporting the refs. 
[00:40:00]  This guy is going to explain further why maybe we shouldn't.  Let's go to Jeff on Long Island.  Jeff.  Hey, how you doing, guys?  Jeffy Kenton.  What's up, Jeff?  It's the refs that are the douchebags here.  For years, the NFL has been paying full for their pensions with the refs who work part-time  four hours a week paying nothing to their pensions.  These assholes need to just get with the rest of the world, pay something towards their pensions,  and get back to work.  Maybe you might be right, dude. 
[00:40:30]  I'm not saying that.  I don't know.  But even if you're right, and even if the NFL should be fighting with them, they should  still acknowledge that their replacement refs stink.  Oh, absolutely.  But it's the refs that are being the assholes here.  Okay.  Because who doesn't pay to work their own pension?  And they work four hours a week, and they're getting millions of dollars into their retirement.  Wow.  And they don't want to contribute anything.  That's the holdup.  Now, Jeff, you seem to know more.  I mean, why couldn't the NFL get better refs to replace these guys? 
[00:41:00]  I mean, if they're getting them from the lingerie league where these guys got kicked out of  that league because they sucked, why can't they get better refs?  You can't go down and get college football refs because they're...  The second-best refs are in college.  Right.  They're playing right now.  And there's just no experience out there in this game.  I mean, look at...  And the college guys aren't going to leave because they're playing right now.  Yeah, because they got a gig.  Yeah.  Yeah, they'll lose their gig.  But the game is so fast.  These guys are, I mean, incredible athletes. 
[00:41:30]  We see the slow-mo instant replay.  It's easy for us to sit there and say, oh, well, that's clear.  But when it's, you know, when they're traveling 40 miles an hour downfield full speed, it's  impossible to see it.  And if it wasn't for instant replay, we probably wouldn't even have all these issues.  Well, that's...  Yeah, the refs...  They're saying the refs have never refed games at this speed.  Yeah, they suck, but it's not like they're...  It's not like it's their fault.  They're just not cut out for it.  Well, that's why they get paid the...  That's why what they do is a rare job, and that's why. 
[00:42:00]  That's their job to judge it at that speed.  Right.  Well, it's only a part-time job.  Most of these guys are lawyers and whatnot.  Four hours a week, pay towards your pension, this issue's solved.  Yeah, but I mean, that's what...  I understand what you mean, but they have replay.  And the fact that the NFL just refuses to admit that they're wrong, and as far as these  refs, just like Bud Selig, they're fucking pigs.  They're just fucking pigs.  But these games, the reason why they don't do the replay on all the penalties is because 
[00:42:30]  the games take forever.  I think they just...  That's what I see.  These games are taking 10% longer per week because of the replacement refs.  They're actually reviewing more plays than they normally would.  Like, all turnovers now are reviewed.  Like, last year, they didn't have that.  It used to be just touchdowns.  But, you know, same thing with baseball.  They only do home runs.  They won't do strikes or balls.  You can't do everything.  I understand that, yeah.  Yeah, I...  The Jets game this past weekend was uncomfortably long. 
[00:43:00]  That's all I know.  It just felt way too long.  They can't do it.  These games are starting to push five hours, right?  I mean, not five hours.  Three hours.  Excuse me.  Well, they even pushed back the start of the afternoon.  No, wait.  One o'clock to five...  No, four hours.  Well, they have to get more commercials in, too.  Yeah.  Why do they have to take a fucking commercial after every single time out?  If they don't want the game to be as long, how about they don't take as many fucking three- or four-minute commercial blocks?  But everything has to be sponsored, Jimmy.  Exactly.  Oh, here's the Hyundai football handoff. 
[00:43:30]  What?  All right, Jeff.  Thank you, buddy.  Later.  All right.  Have a good day.  And by the way, they could actually...  If they technically wanted to, they could easily do balls and strikes by GPS and computer now.  Like, we can track...  We can track anything...  Is this future, Jimmy?  No, but they won't do it.  Is this future, Jimmy?  No?  Oh, I thought this was future, Jimmy.  In the future... 
[00:44:00]  Let's say you have some kind of a GPS setup for the...  Which just completely maps the batter and the fucking...  And the strike zone and the distance.  You could absolutely have a perfect strike zone every time where the ball crosses that zone.  It's kind of like self-checkout.  I think at this point, baseball, you don't need anyone.  No.  You do the chips.  What's that?  And there's sneakers on the bases.  The baseball, it would be all set.  Oh, right.  Yeah, it should have been a baseball.  I'd do that. 
[00:44:30]  Because the runners have those things in their shoes.  Electronic bases, electronic shoes, electronic balls.  Let's just play a video game.  Well, I'm just saying that if people want the calls, right?  No, but think about it.  I do.  I am a purist.  Think about it.  You probably wouldn't need...  I bet you could play a baseball game without a ref.  Sure, you could play a perfect baseball game, sure.  But, I mean...  I'm one of the guys that likes umpires.  But it wouldn't be a perfect game.  Why do you like umpires?  I like the human element of the game.  Oh.  You have that... 
[00:45:00]  You like that?  Yeah.  But you have the human element with the mistakes the players make and stuff.  We lose all those exciting strike three calls.  Oh, really?  But Jimmy's right.  He got him.  He got him.  Jimmy's right with GPS, though.  It would be so obvious every single time if it was a ball or strike.  Yeah.  All the networks do that anyway.  I know.  That's what I'm saying.  Yeah, they got their strike zone cam and...  Yeah.  So why not?  If every game counts as something, and you're not paying to watch the referees or the umpires, 
[00:45:30]  all they do is...  Whenever they get it right, good.  That's your job.  And when they fuck it up, they cost people games.  So why would anyone want their team knocked out of a playoff spot because someone's not  doing their job right?  If it's a player, that's one thing.  How about just a mechanical pitcher and a batter?  Because you want to watch them play the game.  I want to watch players play.  There was a video game called Base Wars, and it was just robots playing baseball.  Robots playing baseball.  I like it.  Remember Base Wars?  I like that.  That sounds terrible.  I hate to watch robots play all squeaky. 
[00:46:00]  Why would they be squeaky?  The thud when the fucking ball hits the park.  Why would they be squeaky?  Because they're running to fresh for that girl.  I love Jim's immediate concerns about something.  Yeah, yeah.  Squeaky.  All squeaky.  You see the new robot video?  What happened?  Of that thing running?  The robot running?  Creepy.  I never know when this shit's going to pop into my brain, but you're talking robots,  and it reminded me of a video I wanted to bring to the show, and I forgot all about.  It's a new robot video where this thing's running as fast as a cheetah.  No way.  Put in robot cheetah or something like that. 
[00:46:30]  You've got to see this fucking thing.  What's he cheating on?  You're incorrigible.  Watch this.  It goes.  Whoa.  What the hell is this?  Cheetah robot runs 28.3 miles per hour.  It's up to 14 and a half miles right now.  This thing looks silly.  Put this up on our Facebook page.  You rock.  Opie and Anthony on Facebook.  Why is it so scary?  Yeah, why is he cheating?  Why is he cheating?  Watch how fast this fucking thing gets. 
[00:47:00]  This looks like a Herbie Hancock video.  It's so loud.  It looks like a Tite fighter.  Whoa.  What was that?  I hope he's finished.  He's not fucked up.  Yeah.  Doesn't even look like a cheetah though.  It looks like a monster.  Yeah, that's why I'm bringing it up.  This is scary.  It's running on a treadmill and it's very quick. 
[00:47:30]  I could never do that.  Why is that so disturbing?  It's tapped out right before 30.  It does the same thing where the rear legs come up.  Yeah, man.  In between the front legs when it runs.  Yeah, they also, you know, it's funny.  You see what they do with this, with the weird computer thing where they sent men to space in it?  That's what machines do.  They do shit better than us.  Who gives a fuck? 
[00:48:00]  We're all shocked that the machine is better than us.  Try jumping up into space to see how fucking far you get.  Try walking to work every day.  I would just release some of those fucking things, man.  Why don't you release those robot cheetahs?  Fuck yeah.  I'd put them in police uniforms and I'd chase down perps.  Instead of fucking, instead of endangering fucking police dogs over in Iraq or Afghanistan,  have some fucking monster cheetah chasing them down.  Monster.  You're right, though.  Like, every car is just a machine and that thing wails out at well over a hundred and 
[00:48:30]  whatever miles an hour.  It's a cheetah with wheels.  Yeah.  It's a fucking wheeled cheetah.  Hey, look at my cheetah.  It's smooth.  It's called a Lexus.  Your cheetah goes, shaka, shaka, shaka, shaka, shaka.  Shaka, shaka, shaka, shaka, shaka.  Shaka, shaka, shaka, shaka.  Try walking on the fucking train tracks.  Yeah.  Fucking forever.  There's a machine.  Exactly.  That's the big snake.  Watch that big snake robot with the people on it. 
[00:49:00]  Shoot down the tracks.  You know?  By the way, I might have to be off because I'm doing Leno.  I'm taking a mechanical kangaroo, which leaps over the country.  I have one jump.  Yeah.  It's really amazing.  All right.  I guess it's not amazing.  Oh, wow.  Oh, is that funny?  No, it actually is amazing.  That robot shit scares me.  Because it has living creature motion, which is what's pretty interesting. 
[00:49:30]  Because you know...  No one has wheelie legs.  Legs that are just wheels.  You wait until they get people running that fast.  That's the next stage of police work, too, someday.  Oh, future Jimmy.  Future Jimmy.  We'll tell you.  Future Jimmy.  Robocop, that type of stuff will exist.  Yeah.  They'll run real fast, and they'll just be treadmills all over for the...  Chunk, chunk, chunk, chunk, chunk, chunk, chunk.  Chunk, chunk, chunk, chunk, chunk, chunk.  Chunk, chunk, chunk, chunk, chunk, chunk.  I love future Jimmy.  I love future Jimmy. 
[00:50:00]  All right, listen.  We're going to break the Francesa stuff.  Is it good?  Yeah.  All right, we'll play it after the break.  You weren't too enthusiastic about it.  I mean, I don't know if it's quite as good as last week.  That's probably because he doesn't mention his viral video.  I mean, it's not.  It's 3,000 views.  How many views do you have on your viral video?  It's pushing 2 million.  1.6 million.  Wow.  Worldstar Hip Hop fucking put it up on their front page.  Holy shit.  E-bombs World.  Someone just tweeted me another place that just put it up.  I mean, it was on all day.  YouTube.  You just go to YouTube.com and go Most Popular.  Oh, there it is. 
[00:50:30]  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  Third place.  Wow.  Fucking Sam is on his way to nowhere.  He's exactly here.  Even this won't work for him.  No.  That's good.  You got some kind of black cloud over you.  Oh, I know.  It's his hair.  Family members.  You think?  I mean, am I fooling myself to think somebody at Sirius would have acknowledged it by now?  Yeah.  Wait, what do you mean?  Shut up.  What do you mean?  Well, they must have.  They must have.  Is the publicist for Sirius?  What?  No.  No, huh?  Am I crazy? 
[00:51:00]  Yeah.  One of our guys has a massively successful video, and they don't even know down the hall.  Yeah.  Nah.  Yeah.  It was played here first.  If they're trying to build up their web presence, wouldn't they put that up on their site?  Well, it probably is on their site.  No.  Oh, boy.  The Radio Wizard, nothing from the Radio Wizard on this one?  No.  Oh, boy.  The IT.  What?  Are they?  These people just, are they just hoping this place just crumbles to nothing?  I don't know.  But maybe I should have gone to the web department myself. 
[00:51:30]  Fucking lazy.  Yeah, and then gotten permission to upload it.  That's where they have to.  That's where they need a better.  That's where they need a fucking computer department.  That you can't ignore the ability of this.  How about you say they need a better blank department, and then you can fill in a million  fucking words there.  Are you saying that there's more than one area that needs work?  Oh, my God.  Jesus.  If this was like the old game Tropico, I wouldn't even know where to start fixing. 
[00:52:00]  I want to get that cheetah robot watch just run up and down these holes, running over  everybody and running into people.  Just through things.  Yeah.  Another missed opportunity for the company, though.  It's unbelievable.  Yeah, of course.  One of their employees has a viral video, and they don't even know about it.  Like, it's massive.  It's going everywhere.  This thing will do at least three million views.  At least.  Maybe they know about it.  They're just not impressed.  I don't know.  I think it'll do way more than three at this point, to be honest with you.  Really?  Yeah.  Well.  Thanks. 
[00:52:30]  Oh, yeah.  You're just negative.  I don't know.  Our pal Bill Burr was on Conan O'Brien.  Got a little clip from his appearance.  Ooh.  Nice.  You don't do Conan, huh?  I've never done Conan.  But that was because...  What's his fucking problem?  It's not Conan.  I've never met Conan.  It was his...  The Booker...  Right.  ...was kind of a cunt to me my entire career.  Why?  Just was.  He didn't like me.  For what reason?  Don't know.  I mean...  Didn't like your humor?  Like everybody else in show business, he would never be honest about it. 
[00:53:00]  Right.  Probably that.  But, you know, and I know he didn't like me, so he would...  Is he still there?  Nope.  But in a brief nutshell, I had already done Letterman, and I had already done Panel on Leno.  And instead of just offering me a date and then looking at the material, he wanted to see the material first, like having an audition.  He was just being a cocksucker.  Oh, fuck.  So I was like...  And the producer had said, yeah, we'll have Jim on.  He was just being a cocksucker.  But that was the Booker.  They had nothing to do with Conan.  So maybe you'd do Conan someday. 
[00:53:30]  Yeah, I would...  Sure.  I would do it.  Of course.  I would do any of those shows.  All right.  Bill Burr was on, and this is what he had to say.  I'm not a big fan of Steve Jobs, personally.  What are you talking about?  I just...  I don't know.  I just don't understand what the big deal was with that guy.  I don't get it.  He's like Edison.  I don't know.  So he invented all this stuff, everybody.  What are you talking about?  But did he?  Did he?  Did he sit down and like, I'm going to invent the iPhone, and just sat there soldering, 
[00:54:00]  possibly welding, right?  Didn't he have like a crew of guys helping him out?  Sure, maybe he did.  So why, when he went to those nerd fests, didn't he have like a chorus of scientists behind  him who helped him out, too?  He walked out like he was Tesla.  Like tapping into electricity.  I'm not with you.  I think he just kind of like told people what to invent.  Like he just kind of came in like, I want my whole music collection in that phone.  Get on it!  And then all these nameless, faceless guys made it happen. 
[00:54:30]  Yeah.  And then they have the big nerd concert, and he goes out there by himself.  No belt, you know, sneakers on.  I just didn't buy it.  That's the craziest rant.  It is a joke.  Craziest rant.  I don't like, and the way they...  How do I walk out on this show with all the writers and stuff?  No, and I never will.  All right.  But you don't...  Just the way he advertised.  Jesus, Gandhi, me! 
[00:55:00]  You know?  I just thought that was a little...  The first one never worked, and four months later, all right, here he is.  Here's the one that worked.  Yeah, it bugged me.  Jeez, you'd think I was like trashing the president or something.  You guys are really like pulling back here.  It's worse than that for people.  Everyone's got an iPhone, you know?  Hey, look.  No, I can't say that.  I was going to say, he's gone.  They still came out with another one, right?  That's true, right?  Oh.  Look, when David Lee Roth left Van Halen, could Eddie not play guitar anymore? 
[00:55:30]  You know what I'm saying?  Right.  That's a good analogy.  The Opie and Anthony Channel.  Channel.  Channel.  Channel.  Channel.  On Sirius XM.  Travel.  to the  Travel.

[01:07:00]  what someone looked like  and a lot of people say  this is why  he lost the election  and it's the turning point in politics  because it then became  more important  how you looked  his sweating  you know  that's a great point  it then became more important  that was a turning point  right there  before that  you know  fucking taft  people loved taft  look at truman  truman  well harry truman  kind of got the job  through you know  president croaking  but  oh he did  he's one of those guys  but then he was re-elected  wait who croaked  uh  fucking uh

[01:38:00]  That's a good find  You really do, man  Um...  Madonna calls Obama a Muslim  And begs concertgoers to vote for him  Oh, enough with her already in a fuckin'...  She is so fuckin' done  Just an out-of-touch  Yes  What a dope wants to give up more of her money  Lady Gaga says she suffers from bulimia  Really?  Not anymore  Fatty  You know that her parents have a restaurant in our neighborhood? 
[01:38:30]  I am  Very close to where I live  And...  It's getting some of the worst restaurant reviews ever  Really?  It's in the paper today, matter of fact  They gave it one star  Oh, no...  Is part of that a backlash against Lady Gaga?  You think just the critics being cunts?  I...  I...  I got my, uh...  My ear to the ground  And people are saying  Holy fuck, this food is bad  Oh, okay  Where is this, uh...  It's in the paper somewhere  I don't know which paper 
[01:39:00]  Because they all look like the same paper to me  Oh  But it's in there  What's it...  Is it about the bad restaurant?  Oh, yeah  Maybe you can read a little bit about it for everybody  I don't know what paper it's in  Roland, you went?  I went once  And?  And Roland, uh...  You're a foodie  Yes  You're one of those guys  Yeah  It was...  It wasn't that good  No?  No  No  Did her parents, uh...  Huh?  Oh!  Oh, bless you  Did her, uh...  Are...  Are they in the business? 
[01:39:30]  I...  I think they just used her name to open it  So they don't know what the fuck they're...  No  They're doing?  Oh, Sam found the article  Restaurant Review  Yes  I haven't gone yet  Because I went there once  And they couldn't sit me  My wife and my kid  What?  Yeah  The sauce is not that good  And I go, there's no one in here  What do you mean?  Yeah, everything's reserved  Yeah, they're so pompous  They think  Yeah, no, I had a  The lasagna or something else  I was like, ugh 
[01:40:00]  Is it bad?  Yeah  Oh, ugh  What?  Give me, uh...  Give me some review here or there, Sam  I can't find this article  We got online  The headline, like the sub-headline is  Italian spot owned by Lady Gaga's parents  Is an incomprehensible imitation of a restaurant  Well, that's not a good start  Why would they give it one star out of five?  That sounds like a no star  Well, they take a picture of the people before they ate  As if on purpose, the place is missing the creativity and commitment that made their daughter a star 
[01:40:30]  The result is a careless, lifeless production that feels like a weird facsimile of a restaurant rather than the real thing  Ah  They just threw it together, huh?  I came with an open mind despite the fact that most of my colleagues have portrayed Joanne as the worst thing since herpes  It's called Joanne?  That's the restaurant  Holy shit, this is not a good review  Where is it? 
[01:41:00]  Why don't we go there?  West side  It's on like 60, what, about 8?  Yeah  68 in what?  Close  I'd go there and eat somewhere around there  68?  Yeah  Is that about right?  First sign that they may have been right plopped on the table  The first sign may have been right plopped on the table before we ordered  Four pale, blank-tasting pieces of, quote, chef's artwood, oven-baked focaccia with the texture of kitchen sponges  Oh, God 
[01:41:30]  Focaccia, how about for Bloomberg?  How about for Remember Ya?  There's so many we could do hours of this  Oh, my God  What else?  Another thing  When a restaurant charges $18 for a fried calamari  Should the dish arrive so sloppy-plated that it looks like the kitchen threw it back in the bowl after dropping it?  Should the appetizer glow with grease or boast more breadcrumbs than squid? 
[01:42:00]  And should the accompanying marinara sauce taste like a powdered mix?  Wow  It was chewy, though, the calamari  Chewy, huh?  It's like you're chewing bubblegum  It was chewy  Yeah, fly the enterprise right there  Chewy  Millennium Falcon  The most edible appetizer  The most edible appetizer  Baked, stuffed mushrooms, $14  Still wouldn't pass muster in a diner 
[01:42:30]  Oof  Oh, it's just that food is lousy  Is there anything redeeming?  No, entrees get even more egregious  Eggplant Parmesan, $24  Arrives gloppy, sloppy, flavorless mess  Can I have the gloppy, sloppy, flavorless mess, please?  Whose net effect is the culinary equivalent of old cars in a massive pile-up  A skin of barely melted cheese only worsens the pain 
[01:43:00]  Fuck  Yeah, the cheese wasn't good  Oh my god, this place stinks  And the thing is, they've been getting terrible reviews and they're not doing anything  So it's gonna close  I was hoping for the shits to get out of my body  Wow, now I want to go eat there  Because it sucks  Well, just talking about it honestly on the air  Why don't we go there for lunch today?  Because I may have to cancel therapy to watch the Carol Burnett interview if I'm allowed to watch it  Yeah, I'm not sure you're allowed  The only thing that's good is 
[01:43:30]  What's going on with us?  Oh, no, no, Gary's working  I'm the Carol Burnett  Why does anyone have to work on it?  Carol Burnett is here  You're a fucking stand-up comic  She's a fucking legend  Amy's interviewing her  So I was  My friend's interviewing her  It should be a no-brainer  Yeah  They should reserve a seat for you  Well, why do they have to work on it?  Maybe they will  If no one has said no  No one has said anything  God, enough already  Just do the right thing  Maybe they will  Shouldn't even be an issue  Buy us free lunch  They will probably in the end  But it always has to be a thing 
[01:44:00]  They make things  Stop making things  They make things  Enough with your things  Stop  Make your job hard  Here it is  Exactly  Gaga  Try gag gag  Gag gag  And the one star  Means don't bother  It's the lowest they go  With their restaurant reviews  Wow  They don't go to no stars  I guess out of respect  They don't do zero stars  So they gave it  The worst rating ever  It's a don't bother 
[01:44:30]  Wow  Mm-hmm  In short  Lady Gaga's parents eatery  Strays far away  From  The edge of glory  Ah  Look how they do that  Ah  I see  In the don't miss section  Yeah  These are the don't misses  Yeah  None of the dishes  We sampled to qualify  Is a don't miss  Wow  So they want you to  Miss everything  And it proves my point  That Lady Gaga  Is way overrated  Just like her  Fucking parents  No 
[01:45:00]  No  No  Period  Lady Gaga's  Not open for discussion  Sorry  She's wonderful  But any goodwill  You muster  Will go out the window  When you notice  How about any goodwill  You ketchup  It's goodwill  That you're hunting for  When you notice  Expresso  Beveled chips  Motherfucker  Expresso is spelled  With an X  On the menu  Expresso  Yep  Why  I didn't have that  Why are they being  All cutesy with that 
[01:45:30]  What does that mean  They may just be dumb  Oh wow  That would be crazy  Oh  Free lunch  Oh  Free lunch  Did you hear Roland  When Opie was  Scalding management  For the Carol Burnett thing  Roland just mumbles  Yeah why won't they  Buy us free lunch  I'm not even talking  About that  That's a good point  You make a good point  Though Roland  Yeah free lunch  Because Jimmy  If he's waiting  He's gonna need food  Uh huh  And we need food  Well  I have a little blood sugar  It's true  I suffer every day 
[01:46:00]  Bye you Roland  Yeah  Sorry to hear that  So why were we  Talking about Lady Gaga  Oh cause of Madonna  Her restaurant  They're pretty much  The same person  One's just older  Um  Madonna was uh  Talking about Obama  Yeah  And we got the clip  I'm a little monster  Why would he  Why would she say  That he's uh  A black Muslim  She's trying to get  More controversy  Because she's just  So outrageous  Cause she doesn't  I'll tell you why  Love it  Oh  Because she doesn't  Have the fucking  Balls  To criticize Islam  On stage 
[01:46:30]  The way she's always  On a crucifix  So using that  She's a fucking  1967 rebel  Uh who just refuses  To criticize Islam  Right  Who's treating women  Far worse than Catholicism  So the only way  She can mention  Muslim  Is to say something  That again  A cornball  Thinks is shocking  Right  There's a black Muslim  In the White House  Vote for him  Right  But then say  A positive thing  She's again  A fucking  A fucking  Phony maverick  Well with that 
[01:47:00]  Here's this  Gotta think about it  In 1864  If I have my number  Correct  I'm a little dizzy  I was relevant  I hate that echo shit  Makes it hard to hear  She's just talking  About slavery  And you know  Oh slavery  God  She's embarrassing  She does that in concert  Though  She does a lot  A lot of speeches  Yeah it's like  Just shut the fuck up  Old lady  And do a better  Superbowl show  Grandma  Stunk  Alright  That's terrible  I hate it  Alright  Foot  Foot  Take a seat on the couch

[01:48:30]  John Wilkes Booth  Had his agenda  You know  She's just  Such  A fucking  Irritating  Old lady  At this point  Yes  Is she really  Bringing up  Lincoln  It's like  Shut the  Fuck  Up  Tunnel named after him  How about this  Sing a song  Yeah  Sing a song  About Lincoln  Because at this point  She does a montage  Of all her hits  Because there's so many hits  So she could have done  A hit right there  Yeah  Instead of  How about this  Again 
[01:49:00]  This is why I fucking  Hate when musicians  Babble  Fucking  Either do it in a song  Or shut the fuck up  Yeah  If I'm gonna do this  On stage  I can't stand up there  And give a speech  This  Imagine it's a stand up  Going  You know  Lincoln  They killed him  The way they kill  All the profits  Boo  The club owner  Would be saying  You're killing my profits  Exactly  They'd be annoyed  Like we're not paying  You to do this  Yeah  So shut the fuck up  Fucking

[01:52:00]  I guess  I guess because his name  Is what it is  That makes him a Muslim  In your eyes  What a fucking  Dummy she is  Oh is she terrible  Yeah  She's a rich dummy though  She's a  She's a great  Fucking singer  But she's just a fucking  A corny old lady  At this point  I had to cut that clip off  At some point  Because she went on and on  But at the end  How embarrassing  I'm assuming that she went into  One of her songs  Because  Express yourself  No she closed that with  But you know  I've been working hard  A lot lately 
[01:52:30]  And it's been a while  Since I had a  Holiday  I love when they go into  Songs like that  Isn't that great  Nice  And then she went into  Vogue  No  See I missed the point  Yeah yeah wrong  I missed the point guy  I missed the point  Oh good one Chip  Yeah I know  Oh shit  Oh  It's not a bad song  You know  This song's gotta be  30 years old  I think this song stinks  It's not a bad  Holiday  Well she didn't perform 
[01:53:00]  A concert  The video screen  You saw it  And then she left  Holiday  For like 10 minutes  They played a video of it  Yeah  All the dancers danced  Then she came back out  Well you know  When you're pontificating  She probably needs to  Go back in and say  Alright  Can I have some other  Some other things to say  That will make me sound  Young and relevant  Criticize Islam  Stupid  If you want to be relevant  Criticize the fucking people  Who are rioting  All over the Middle East  Over a fucking video  Because they have  Or criticized the Egyptian 
[01:53:30]  Woman  When there's an ad  In the New York subway  Calling  Saying if you're  Civilized people  Fighting savages  Always go with the  Civilized people  The Israelis put it out  Or people for Israel  It does not mention Muslims  It does not mention Islam  It says something about  Jihad  And if you're a jihadist  I think you're a savage  Exactly  Because you're basically  Advocating holy war  That to me makes you a savage  It's not saying all Muslims  Muslims always say  They want to be separated  And they don't always  Want to be lumped in 
[01:54:00]  So this ad does that  And mentions jihadists  Specifically  And people have a problem  And people have a problem  And what a shock  The Egyptian activist  The Egyptian war  Activist  Spray paints it  What a shock  The woman who  Objects to what is said  Yeah  Wants to fucking ruin it  So people can't read it  Yeah  Fucking sickening  That's the same thing  They do with welfare  Here in this country  You talk about welfare  And people call you racists  Like oh you're just saying  That it's minorities  That are on welfare  And then the second 
[01:54:30]  Republican wants to cut  Welfare  They talk about how  Minorities need welfare  It's such hypocrisy  Holiday  Oh she went into it like that  Huh  Yeah  So fucking rad  Very douche chilling  My rock and roll fantasy  Hey uh  I just checked my Twitter  Really quickly  So the gals are having a problem  With the hula hoop video

[02:02:00]  I took a picture with her  She was a mope  This is good  Wait you took a picture with her?  Cindy Lauper  I want to hear when it kicks in  Yeah she had zero personality  You know how sometimes you walk around a corner next to you  You know you're like  Face to face with a celebrity  And you walk in right next to them  Yes  So I go  Hey Cindy Lauper in the house  And she just made believe she didn't hear me  Alright look  That was my opening line  In the house  That was my opening line  How about hi Cindy  Welcome  Well because I was surprised by her  So I went oh Cindy Lauper in the house  That's the second worst thing you've said to a celebrity 
[02:02:30]  The first being good luck bro  Yeah and she's in the building  At the house  Oh shit  Then it was an awkward walk down the hall  As we're shoulder to shoulder  And I'm like okay  Alright then  You should have said something like  Hey Cindy Lauper  You just want to have fun?  No  No  I should have  That would have been just as bad I guess  Say I'm a goonie  And if you want to know what she  I haven't got enough  If you want to know what she looks like these days  Imagine your grandma 
[02:03:00]  Trying out for the Jersey Shore  Who kid said he would fuck her?  Yes I heard  Well he would probably  Who kid said he'd fuck her?  That's one I wouldn't do  And then he called her a nigga  Yeah  Yes he did  Which is pretty god damn funny  I wouldn't do that one for the story  No?  You wouldn't  Nah  I'd better suck it  You would?  It was awfully mushy below the belly button  A lot of mush  A lot of mush  A lot of mush  Yeah she seems like a bit of a cunt  She kind of was cunty  She's not a polite person  She's not a good nature person 
[02:03:30]  Granted my opening line wasn't that great  But I don't get nothing for that  Yeah  Nothing  She's so trained  She didn't even turn her fucking head  You'll get nothing and like it  We went down and met her  When she was doing Celebrity Apprentice too  She's always been  Cunty?  Yeah  That's the word for it  She's kind of cunty  And it's almost like  She's had some good songs  But like you were  And I ran out for a photo with her  But it's just like  I collect them  Believe me  If she was the lady  Who fucking hacked off the arms  In Apocalypse Now  I'd still want a picture with her  What did you do? 
[02:04:00]  I built a pile of inoculated arms  Can we take a picture together?

Huh?  Wish I was special  So fucking special  But I'm a creep  I'm a widow 
[02:04:30]  What the hell am I doing here?  I don't belong here  Even if it hurts  I want to have control  I want a perfect body  I want a perfect song 
[02:05:00]  I want you to know this  When I'm not around  I wish I was special  I'm so fucking special  But I'm a creep  I'm a hero 
[02:05:30]  What the hell am I doing here?  I don't belong here  I don't belong here  I don't belong here  I don't belong here 
[02:06:00]  I want you to know this  Whatever makes you happy  Whatever you want 
[02:06:30]  It's so fucking special  I wish I was special  I'm not free  I'm not with you  What the hell am I doing here? 
[02:07:00]  I don't belong here  I don't belong here  Can I quickly give a banana update? 
[02:07:30]  Because people are way in with the whole banana thing  That's the same banana  Thank you, that's why I'm doing a banana update  If you're hearing about the bananas on the Opian Anthem Show for the first time  Club Soda Kenny loves bringing in banana dongers  A donger?  A giant phallic  Where the fuck do you get these bananas?  They're special for you, they're phallic symbols  This is like 13 inches  That looks the same too  It looks exactly like the one I had the other day  Except it's got speckles on it 
[02:08:00]  The herp  It's the brother from the other day  Oh  Why can't you?  I like a banana that's a bit curved  No, you like what I get  For her pleasure  I like what you get  You fuck  So, I got another banana that looks like a dong  Or a donger  Dong? A cock  Banana dong  Cock  Little Steven outside the studio  Yes  Fucking Roland is making time with little Steven  What?  What's he doing?  Steven Van Zandt  Roland 
[02:08:30]  Roland, don't tie up our guest  Yeah  How you doing, Steven?  What's up, Steven?  How are you, sir?  Everybody good?  Look at you, Hollywood  Oh yeah  Steven Van Zandt is Hollywood  He works the room  Yes, he does  Hollywood and rock star  And rock star  That's crazy  We saw...  Oh, where is he going?  He's saying hi to the room  Excuse me, the videographer's office  You're the important guy  Steven, can I start by saying  I've been a Bruce Springsteen fan forever  Saw my first show  How embarrassing is that?  Just recently 
[02:09:00]  But what a great place to see it  The Apollo Theater  No, no, no  No, I didn't go to that one  Oh, well then  We're rolling at the...  Where?  Prudential  I think you guys are onto something  Holy fuck  I don't know why it's taking me so long to see you guys  But I was blown away by how soulful the band is  That's all I want to tell you  Yeah  Well...  There's some soul with you guys  Yeah, a bit more this tour than even, you know, before  Because now we kind of, you know, are really exploring the whole soul roots and gospel roots with the horn section and singers 
[02:09:30]  And I gotta tell you, I don't download them, but the new songs, oh my god, they're really good  No, it's really been amazing  It's been an amazing tour this year  I mean, I think we all just kind of raised our game a little bit, you know what I'm saying?  Because, you know, you lose Clarence and what are you gonna do, right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah  So, you know, there's no replacing him, obviously, so, you know...  But his nephew's doing a good job and you guys are bringing him up nice  Yeah, no, and like I say, I think we all, I think, raised our game a little bit to make up for that 
[02:10:00]  Because, you know, it's like, wow  Oh, man  How was it during the Apollo?  That was amazing, actually, you know?  Them old theaters, and we're about to talk about another one in a minute, but those old theaters have a magic, I swear to God  You know, I mean, it sounds like silly, but you walk in those places and you just feel the history, you know?  And that is, you know, among all the theaters, maybe the most legendary of them all  Was that your first time? Because we saw McCartney there, too, who did it the year before 
[02:10:30]  And you could tell even these iconic rock guys feel something when they're working in that room  That's true, I was there at that thing with Paul McCartney also, and I've been there before  It's always the same, it's just a magical place, I mean, you know, the history there is just, you know  And you guys can feel that, obviously  You really can, you really can  It sounds like a showbiz type of thing, but I swear to God, it's true  You know what one of my favorite parts were? It was the after party  I sat down at a table and started eating with my chick, and I got kicked out by the E Street Band 
[02:11:00]  It was great, it was your guy's table  No kidding, man  It was reserved, and I was sitting there like an idiot  Nobody told me  I was told to get the fuck out of there  Put it in a nice way, I'm sure  Oh, I felt like a douche  Even if you weren't there, you should have felt that way  We just want to  True  We just want to feel for once that we made it  That's all  One time, one time we want to feel like, holy fuck, we made it  Do you think, do you think someone like, let's say, like Tom Hanks 
[02:11:30]  Right  Is backstage somewhere at the Academy Awards, or wherever the hell he would be  And ever has the feeling like, oh boy, I'm going to get kicked out at any moment  That's how I feel everywhere I am  Yeah  Exactly  Except at an AA meeting, you'll never feel that way there  Cause he'll never go  Just to fill in  When we won, we won something, one year we won something with the Sopranos  And we're going down to the press room, you know, the whole Sopranos cast  Yeah  And the guy came up to us and said, you know, we're feeling like good 
[02:12:00]  Oh no  We're feeling tough, you know  Sure  We're winning everything  The guy comes over and says, listen, Barbara Streisand is coming down the hallway  Don't look at her  Oh God  Are you kidding?  I swear  Please tell me you looked right at her  I was like, you know  Oh my God  Right  Yeah  You should have treated her like  No matter how  You should have treated her like Joey Pants treated that dancer  When he put his hand in the ice, first of all, she was a hooah 
[02:12:30]  One of the greatest scenes for the Sopranos  I love that one, man  She'd know you anyway  I'm sure Barbara Streisand would know you  Or know who you are at least  I don't know, who knows  I don't know  People are like, there's a few of those  You know, you hear those stories, you know  Of course  Diana Ross  You don't think they're true  And then someone tells you don't look at her  Avert your eyes  Are you serious?  Yes  Are you kidding me?  I have people that actually walk down and go, Jim's coming, please look at him  You hired people for that, right, Jimmy?  Yeah 
[02:13:00]  Because the natural inclination is just to look away in shame and discomfort  Hey, Anthony brought a blog to our show  And I know you're probably sick of talking about this  But for maybe one minute, if you could humor us  Blog's saying that Tony dies at the end of that episode  And the guy really breaks it down  It's like 20 pages  I think the biggest part was that they brought up the direction of the last episode  And the final scene of the final episode  And the fact that that bell rings at the diner  And Tony's looking at the door  Every time his head looks up 
[02:13:30]  And then he gets his point of view  It's a POV shot  POV  POV  POV  Right  Again  And then the last  Instead of the POV shot  We get the blank screen  Which technically is the POV shot  Because he's dead  So in other words  Not only is Paul dead  But Tony too  He's a walrus  Remember that from  He's the walrus  Yeah  Paul is dead  The Abbey Road cover meant that Paul was dead  You've had it with this discussion, haven't you? 
[02:14:00]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no  What year is it now?  But why didn't David Chase just tell us and we'll shut up?  Jesus Christ  The Vanity Fair where they came back and talked to all of us like years later  Yeah  It was actually a great article  I was surprised to learn what the other actors were thinking  Oh shit  I was like, that's what they were thinking?  And I kind of like  I think I put the definitive word on it  Yeah  You know what I mean?  At the end of the article they said  Okay, what really happened?  I said  The director yelled cut and the actors went home 
[02:14:30]  Exactly  You understand you stupid son of a bitch  It's a TV show  It's a TV fucking show  Yeah, because if it didn't take place  It didn't take place because it's a show  All right  I mean, yeah, so anyway  Yeah  How about that?  David Chase likes to make you think though  Yeah, yeah  He does the same thing in his new movie  There's a new movie coming out, you know  It's gonna be featured at the New York Film Festival next week  I did the music for it  Oh, fuck  Same thing, he always likes to make people think  Okay  What about the speculation that Sill actually recovered and opened a hat shop? 
[02:15:00]  Is that true?  Well, he might have went to Norway  I don't know  I guess  That's possible  Sure  How did Lilyhammer work out for you?  Because that was the last time you were in  Yeah, you know what?  It worked out all right?  It was phenomenal success  I mean the biggest ratings in Norwegian history  Wow  And America, a million and a half views of all eight episodes, which is like a big, big hit  For Netflix, that's great  Yeah  It's the Seinfeld of Norway 
[02:15:30]  Right  It's the  Yeah  It's huge  Huge  Yeah, no, it was really, really, really well received, you know  Right on  Especially because it's a subtitle thing  Which, you know, for America, you don't expect too much from that, you know what I mean?  Right  Because people don't like it  Oh, like reading  But because the lead character was speaking English, it just kind of sucked people in  Right  And it really worked out well  Because you kind of experience Norway the way he does, you know?  Mm  You know, it's all, you know, one big adventure for him  From your POV?  From your POV  Exactly  Precisely the POV thing 
[02:16:00]  Oh, your reaction to that was very funny though  Right? Oh  Okay  POV  Oh, wow  Heard this so many times  Exactly  Hey, you're promoting The Rascals  You're trying to get to  Can I ask you about this?  Kickstartstarter.com, which I've heard of  Is how you get bands to go to places that they might not normally go to by showing that there's an interest?  How does that work?  No, no  I don't think so  Oh, present day Jimmy  You're close  But basically, it's sort of a democratic way of people voting in terms of financially 
[02:16:30]  You know, in other words  Right  You're trying to raise money for whatever the project may be  And the people who will enjoy that product or whatever, you know, you're doing  Actually invest in it  A couple dollars here, whatever they can afford  But then they become part of it, you know, because they participate in the project  So, we're doing a huge, huge show for The Rascals  I mean, they're just so important  We didn't want to just do another concert, you know  And regardless of what happened to Kickstarter, it's going to be a phenomenal production 
[02:17:00]  Mark Brickman's my partner, who we're co-directing and co-producing it  And he did, he was Bruce's first light man  But then he did Pink Floyd, the new Roger Waters Wall show  Sure  He's out right now  Wow  And McCartney and Blue Man Group, the Olympics  I mean, the guy's amazing  So we wanted to do like, it's like a combination Broadway show and live concert  We're going to have some footage of the guys themselves talking about their history 
[02:17:30]  These huge screens  And then we're actually going to hire some actors and do like 10 scenes of The Rascals  You know, in younger days  So it's going to be a combination of that with the actual four original guys performing  Wow  Which is really, no one's seen in 40 years  Geez  They haven't performed in 40 years?  No  I just feel like they have  What's been the problem?  They were  Geez  Well, they're very idealistic guys, you know  They broke up in 1970 and if you ask them, they're not even quite sure why 
[02:18:00]  You know, it wasn't like real bad blood, you know  There was no one incident  But back then there wasn't a lot of longevity in music  Well, that's true  That's true  A lot of people thought after, you know, a decade or however long they lasted  That was good enough  Well, that's right  Ten years was a really long time  Long time  Beatles only made six or seven  We forget  Yeah  Yeah, but they didn't have many hits  Nah, they didn't  No, they didn't  Oh, literal Jim  I would just assume they've been touring ever since  But, you know, smaller venues and all that 
[02:18:30]  But for four years they did not tour  Separately they have  You know, I mean Felix  As The Rascals is one of those bands  Like Felix and The Rascals  Yeah, yeah, yeah  You know, Eddie and The Rascals  You know, Dino and Gene with The Rascals  So, it's been different rascals  And, you know, it was just  They were very idealistic in the sense that a lot of people threw a lot of money at them  But, you know, it didn't matter to them  I finally reunited them two years ago privately for a benefit  For a Christian and Carmen, you know, cancer benefit  So, you know, for cancer, you know, for a good cause they came together 
[02:19:00]  But it wasn't really enough for the money  But they were so good that night  I said, we gotta keep them together, you know  So, for the last three years basically  I've been trying to figure out a way to keep them together  Wow  And it wasn't until Peter Shapiro  This guy who just reopened the Capitol Theater in Portchester  And he restored it to the 1926 magnificence  I mean, it's amazing this place  Where do you see this?  You know, he's like an old school, entrepreneurial, creative guy 
[02:19:30]  You know, you don't see these guys anymore  You know, like, I was just talking, you know, in the hallway  And, you know, people refer to him as the Bill Graham of his generation  In that sense of just being really creative, really interested in giving people a good time  You know, and if you can make some money, obviously you can do that too  But it's not just about money with him, which is really unique these days  And really refreshing  And anyway, this guy not only built, restored the theater  But put in an amazing sound system and lights and projectors 
[02:20:00]  Everything I needed for this show  Because it's like a mixed-media kind of show  Was it closed, this theater?  It was, I think they had gone from being the place where people played in the early 70s  To like, more like, you know, weddings and bar mitzvahs and that kind of a thing, you know  Thank you, baby  And so it hadn't been used as a rock venue, I think, for quite a while  And when I met them, they were still doing a lot of construction and fixing it up  But they just opened like last week with Bob Dylan  And it's really, really intimate 
[02:20:30]  It's like 1,400 seats, it's beautiful, you know  Wow  How'd they get Dylan in a 1,400 seater?  1,400 seater  That's a pretty impressive thing to get Bob Dylan to play something of that size  Exactly, exactly  I mean, he's that kind of, you know, this Peter Shapiro  Really spectacular guy  And, you know, really, you know  Something that gives you hope, you know  For the industry  Because you don't see guys like this anymore  Right  I miss Dylan's radio show  He doesn't do it anymore?  I don't think so  No  I don't know  If he does, then I'm 
[02:21:00]  I don't know  I thought it went away  Maybe  I don't know  If you're not sure and it's still there  Yikes  You know what it was, though?  I looked for it one day, it was gone  So maybe it was on hiatus if it is back  And I never went back there  I must read the page  And the show's, by the way, to promote  I'm sorry  Yeah, go, go, go  No, no, go, man, go  Just December 13, 14, 15  Yeah  Yeah, yeah, and the tickets go on sale Friday  What's today? Where are we?  I don't know  Wednesday  Wednesday  Yeah, yeah, so it is Friday, 11 a.m. 
[02:21:30]  Tickets go on sale  And, you know, a lot of people have been waiting a long time for this  I mean, you know, because the Rascals were not only fantastic  But they were a very, very important group  One of the first ones to insist on having black acts open for them  At a time when it was not cool to do that  You know, People Gotta Be Free was an anthem of the civil rights movement  I'm not familiar with them  Like, I know who they are, but I can't think of any of them  You know, Good Lovin', Groovin', Beautiful Morning  Can you play something in Iraq? I'm sure I know them  Play a little Good Lovin' 
[02:22:00]  Oh, of course  Yeah, of course  I just didn't know the band  Oh, of course, of course  But people know, well, it's true though  People know the music, you know, more than the band  I mean, they literally have been gone all that time  How old are they now?  Eh, mid-60s, you know  Wow  Like, everybody who's cool  There you go  Great answer  Hey, can we ask you a question that we talked about  Was that when you were in London  And you guys were on stage  And McCartney is on stage  And they shut  Oh, fuck yeah  Yeah, they pulled the plug  I mean  Literally  You were mad  Literally 
[02:22:30]  How does someone pull that one?  I mean, what kind of dummy does that?  I know  Sir Paul  Jesus  They were panic-stricken  That the Westminster Council, I guess  You know, that gives them the license  Wouldn't give them next year's license  Because we're ten minutes past the curfew  Oh, boy  We go an hour past the curfew, usually  You know what I mean?  And in this case  It was literally, we might have done one more song  We were talking with Paul  You know, what should be your third song  And  Wait, you guys are figuring that out on stage? 
[02:23:00]  Yeah  That's great  That's just amazing to me  Oh, yeah, yeah, we do that stuff  I always assume that you already know  Right  We have a special guest coming out  Like, okay, obviously we'll play this, this, this  No, we had, you know, we exchanged emails  And I invited him to the show  And he showed up, like, about halfway through the show  I look in the monitor guy  And there's Paul and his wife sitting next to him  Wow  So, you know, Bruce says, come on out  So we just came out  Now, we had rehearsed  I saw her standing there, just in case 
[02:23:30]  And then we've been doing Twist and Shout  So we did that, you know  Which is really quite exciting, actually  Oof  You know, you can imagine  Had you ever played with him before?  No, no  And, you know  Just look over and it's like, hey, that's the guy  Well, yeah, now you're doing Twist and Shout with the guy  Yeah, yeah  You know, there was the Isley Brothers  But, you know, the Beatles Twist and Shout really was a big one also  Did you get starstruck by this one?  You know, the first time I met him, a little bit  It's been a while now since we've known each other  Wow  But, you know, we go out socially occasionally 
[02:24:00]  And he's just a wonderful, wonderful guy  And his wife is terrific  And it was just one of them weird things  I mean, ten minutes past the 10.30 curfew on a Saturday night  Come on  You know, who's sleeping?  And it's not like Kajagoogoo's up there  McCartney and Springsteen  Fucking McCartney and McCartney  I mean, come on  It's really weird  And, you know, everybody apologized forever  But I tell you the truth  Front page knows worldwide  It was the most amazing publicity of our lives 
[02:24:30]  I'm like, we should have paid somebody to pull the plug  Yeah  That's a good idea  Keep it in mind, you know  What's the conversation like on stage  Trying to figure out the third song?  I was about to suggest I'm Down  Which is one of my favorites  And it's simple enough  We could have just whipped it out, you know  Or did Paul say, like, let it be  And you're like, no, no, I'm not a fan of that one  No slow songs, Paul  Yeah, come on, pal 
[02:25:00]  Imagine waving them off now  No, this is not your crowd  It's an encore  But he was great  Because, you know, we  You know, most big acts have, like, that distance  You know, with the audience  Just automatically, right?  You know, sometimes out of protection  With good reason, you know  But Bruce, as you know, you know  Is in the audience  Jumps into the crowd  Half the show now  It's insane  Right?  You know, recently he's like half the show  We passed him along  At the show we went to  Well, there you go 
[02:25:30]  We did, no, we were right there  We passed him along  He wanted to get a little further down the line  That's amazing  You know, once you get down the front of the stage  He has like a platform  Like all the way in the audience  Yep  Right?  And he brought Paul down, you know  And you could tell  It was like  It was really interesting  Because Paul was very, very game  And he went right with Bruce, you know  Because, you know, trusted Bruce  And trusted Bruce's audience, you know  But you could tell, like  This was a pretty, pretty big move  Like every time they got close  Paul was kicking at the audience 
[02:26:00]  And hitting them with his guitar  See Bruce just wailing people in the face  To keep them away from Paul  That'd be exciting  Well, that was fun  Bruce knocked me out  That show was awesome  That had to be awesome  I had never seen you guys live either  And that show was  I'm just trying to find a photo as we're talking  The sound  I mean, you've heard it obviously  But that sound is so huge  So huge from the stage  You got 17 guys up there, is it?  We were talking about this the other day, you know  And I said to Bruce, you know  In a funny way 
[02:26:30]  Springsteen?  Yeah  Sorry  I don't mean a name drop  We know a Bruce as well, you know  His name is Mittman  Bruce Mittman  I thought that just by circumstance  I said in a funny way, you know  I think maybe for the first time  The band is as big as the songs are  Yeah, yeah  You know what I mean?  He's always written, like, big  And he wrote that whole Born to Run  Playing clubs, you know  Can you imagine, you know  Jungle Land  Yeah, yeah, yeah  This huge epic, you know 
[02:27:00]  70 millimeter cinematic masterpiece in a club  You know  He just was like thinking  You know, he's just thinking big  You know, even back then  And now, you know  You got that kind of  You know, with the singers and the horns  And everything  It just kind of like  Blows these things up where they belong  Those songs start up and that sound just hits you  Well, they're all great musicians  Yeah, yeah, yeah  There's no faking that  What's your  It's probably a hack question  But what's your favorite song to perform?  You know, I always 
[02:27:30]  Or shortlist  I'm always going for the ones that we do, you know  Rarely  The tracks, like outtakes  An album of outtakes called Tracks  Yeah  And that second disc is some of my favorites  Some of my favorites  So we did Cynthia the other night from that  And living on the edge of the world the other night  One of the other nights  Born in the USA  You know  In Cadillac  I still like it  In Cadillac  Some of the more obscure ones, right?  Born and run  That's not obscure, Ant 
[02:28:00]  Oh, literal Jim  But also that new album  We put out with the darkness on the edge of town  Wrecking Ball  Wrecking Ball is great song  But the promise with it  It was like an outtake album from the darkness  Okay  It was also one of my favorites  Which we haven't even gotten to those yet  Roland?  You agree?  Yeah, Roland is the hugest  He's a Springsteen fan ever  You probably know by now  Ever  Yeah, you probably recognize him from the crowd  His picture's up in the back  If you see this man tackle him  He's creepy  He's gone to a few shows 
[02:28:30]  Yeah  How many?  How many?  How many shows you've been to?  This tour I went to 18  You went to 18 this tour alone?  Just this tour  Yeah  How many total in your life?  Like 270 now?  Yeah, but  270 shows  How many have you gone to?  Uh, 268  Wow  You missed two, huh?  I missed a couple, yeah  Is it true that Bruce has so many unfinished songs on tape?  Well, who knows?  You know, I mean  I've heard that somewhere though  He's got songs everywhere 
[02:29:00]  Supposedly he's just got  There's songs from his POV  So it's not finished  We don't know how they end  Roland, you've heard that, right?  I heard that different  The concerts are amazing though  In my life  He did like  Lost in the Flood  Which is a rare one  That's right  That's right  That was a  That was a  How about the hitter?  The favorite Springsteen songs are  The hitter and Youngstown  The really  The hitter?  Yeah  Oh boy  Oh boy, Jimmy  The hitter?  Yeah  Oh boy, he's calling out on it  I don't know 
[02:29:30]  Roland?  I think he's making this up  I think he's making this up  Are you making this up?  Do I have to  The hitter?  What's that about  What are you talking about?  The B-side of Glory Day?  Yeah, what is that?  Jimmy's very confident though  I've seen his face  He's confident  Jimmy is confident  I mean, he might  I don't know more  I don't know more  Who would know better than  The nice thing about a 17 piece band  Is you don't have to know all those songs  Yeah, you can probably just sit back  Every once in a while  Somebody knows one  Sit back  Somebody in the band knows  Someone will cover my part  Someone will cover  Someone will cover  Yes, Jimmy, what are you? 
[02:30:00]  While you're looking that up  Let's talk about something else  Alright, sorry  I didn't mean to hold up the entire show  Not only are we reuniting the Rascals  Which is going to be the most amazing event like ever  But they're honoring me at the Little Kids Rock this year  And I'm very proud of that  Because Little Kids Rock is a very cool organization  They actually put guitars in kids hands, you know  And I went to some schools up in the Bronx  And it's like you're hearing these kids a Corvette  You know what I mean?  Like you see their eyes light up  And it's a very, very wonderful organization  Little Kids Rock  That's October 16th 
[02:30:30]  And  Do you see any like talent there?  Well  Some of them like  Yeah, it picks it right up  Yeah, yeah  You know, you do  And you know, just encouraging kids  You know, you never know where it's going to go  It's wonderful  Because all of the arts classes have been cut  You know, as you know, in schools  And there's no chance these kids would ever see a guitar  It wasn't for Little Kids Rock  So  Why the hell did they cut all the art programs?  It's terrible  That drives me nuts  Absolutely  Absolutely  Why did they do that though?  I went, I went, you know  We 
[02:31:00]  Jimmy Scott?  Tim is writing the history of rock and roll right now because of that  I went to the hill to talk to  I talked at the time, Ted Kennedy and Mitch McConnell  Both extremes  And they said it's this  No child left behind legislation, you know  It turned out to have unintended consequences  You know, they're just focusing on testing, you know  And I know that's, you know, legit  But they're so focused on testing they decided to cut all the arts classes, you know  To make, you know  To allow people to like focus on testing for math and science 
[02:31:30]  Please  Meanwhile, kids who take music classes do better in math and science  Yeah, yeah, yeah  You know what I mean?  It works the creative side of your brain  Yeah  It's a workout for your brain  That's not boring  That's it  So my Rock and Roll Forever Foundation decided  Well, we can't win that war right now  So we're going to write the history of rock and roll  And get that into schools  We'll do a pilot program next year  But meanwhile, Little Kids Rock actually are  They are putting guitars in kids' hands  And that's wonderful  So you've got to tell the kids  It's like  You want girls?  Here  Exactly 
[02:32:00]  Take this guitar  And run with it  It is a chick magnet guitarist  Yeah, and if not  Certainly a chick substitute  Which was the case with us for many years  You know  Jimmy might have found something  Well apparently  Did you find the song you made up?  I only have  The song you made up?  Yeah, no, I just kind of came  I made this up  It's a  I happen to have it only on my little portable thing here  So  Portable thing  Stop with your technical jargon  Yeah  That looks expensive, Jimmy  Yeah 
[02:32:30]  What is that?  That's a new Apple device  No doubt  There it is  Are you going to play it?  E-Rock, do you have it?  Why don't you play it then?  Instead of making me fish through my fucking little equipment  Oh my  E-Rock got it the whole time  E-Rock got it the whole time  Wait, stop  E-Rock, stop  What the hell's the matter with you?  That's going to be much cooler on the internet though  Yeah  No, but I'm holding headphones against this 
[02:33:00]  We like that  It kind of sounded cool in a weird way, right?  Yeah, but you can't hear it  But I would rather have fucking E-Rock's in there looking at it  Wait, he had it the whole time  Yes  And Roland, you don't know this?  The Hitter  It is called The Hitter?  Of course it is  Off the album Devils and Dust  Yeah  I would never lie  Oh my god  Well Steven's like wow  If I have to straight up  I knew that, I was just testing you  Of course I knew that  I love this song  I love this song  I was just passing through 
[02:33:30]  And got cold in the rain  That's him alright  Yeah, that's him alright  God damn  Alright, we apologize  We apologize for doubting you  Of course you knew that  Can I tell you how I first heard the song was  Tom Jones did a cover of it  And it was such a powerful song  I wanted to hear the original  And then I heard it  And I know that's a really deep track  But it's about a bare knuckle fighter 
[02:34:00]  Going home and seeing his mother  It's great  Did Bruce write that?  Or is he covering it?  No, that was a cover of a  That was a cover of a  Tom Jones covered Bruce  So it's definitely Bruce's song  Roland, you didn't know that one either  I got to hear the Tom Jones version  Yeah, yeah  I love Tom Jones  Did you hear the new one?  Did you hear the new one Jack White did?  No  I got to hear this  I've been playing it on  Underground Garage  Channel 21  I like it  XM and Sirius  You play Underground Garage  Cool  Yes  I have a Springsteen song you might want to try 
[02:34:30]  He's on my playlist  But I'm sorry we don't play any slow songs  If we ever play a slow song that'll be the one  That is him  That is him  Tom Jones did a cover of Howlin' Wolf of All People Evil  And Jack White I think it's  I don't use this word very often  This guy's a genius  You want to see a tattoo?  You want to see a Jack White tattoo?  Oh Jesus  Of course I do  On the skinniest arms ever?  I try to start every day by watching  Look at this  Look at this 
[02:35:00]  There you go  An actual Jack White autograph on young Sam's  And he had it tatted over  Yeah  Yeah  That's a fan right there  Yeah  A rock icon  Like he's not supposed to be creeped out by a  He thinks that's creepy  I don't know  I got a couple of tattoos of my thing too  You do right?  Yeah yeah yeah  Only they're on really good looking girls though  Jimmy said a right  A right  That's the only difference  Hey Sam do you want  Why not get little Stevie to sign your arm  You got Jack White and Rob Zombie  Why not?  Another icon  There you go  He's out of arms  That's it 
[02:35:30]  I want to hear this Jack White song  But yeah  Or part of it  It's fantastic  And both sides actually are great  It's the single he did for Tom Jones  It's relatively new  You got it E-Rock?  Called Evil  Called Evil by Jack White  It's in the system  Oh God  It's in the system  He plays it on his channel  Yeah you're probably spelling something wrong  How do you spell Jack or White wrong?  T-O-M  J-A-K  Anyway while he's looking for that  Let me tell you about  The 92nd Street Y  Wow you know how to do radio 
[02:36:00]  October 5th  Before the New York Film Festival  Where David Chase's new movie  Not Fade Away  Is gonna be  Is gonna debut  Which you did the music for  I'm interviewing  One of the great  Great legends of all time  Andrew Lou Goldham  October 5th  At the 92nd Street Y  Who's that?  Andrew Lou Goldham  Was the manager  Producer  And publicist  For a while  Of the Rolling Stones  He actually  Discovered them  If you will  In a club  And helped them 
[02:36:30]  Become famous  And he's just an  Incredible guy  That's it  Can you recognize this  In one note?  That's it  One note  That was it  Sam found it  Listen how cool this is  I love his guitar work  If you're a long way from home  That's great  Can't sleep at night  Left your telephone  Something just been around  That's evil 
[02:37:00]  Evil  Evil  Is going all wrong  What a set of  Fucking pipes on  Tom Jones  Still too  Still  That's what's unbelievable  You better watch your house  Do you guys ever hear  Sex Bomb?  That's cool  Phenomenal  Change his riffs  It's crazy  Yeah  But it works 
[02:37:30]  It's horns  Yeah  We're coming gone  Same song  That's awesome 
[02:38:00]  Tom Jones is awesome  Yeah that's good  You know I just learned  I just learned something  The Doors Wildchild  I thought that was  The Doors original  That's part of that song  No I think he's actually  Borrowing that riff for this  I mean  In other words  Jack White  Throws a bunch of different riffs  Into the song  Oh okay  So that is an homage  To The Doors  Okay alright  I wasn't sure what came first  On that one  Yeah I think so  Very cool  Has there ever been people  That showed up  Like McCartney shows up  And you think you invite him down  But are there other guys 
[02:38:30]  That show up  And you think that they want to be asked  To come up on stage  And they're kind of hanging out  But you just know that Bruce  Is not going to invite them up  You see it in their eyes  They're like  Please  Although I don't think he's around anymore  I don't know that's really  Bruce's territory  I don't think about it  Because you know people are coming  To every show  Sure  And some come on stage  And some don't  Yeah I don't know  I've never really thought about it  But have you ever seen people  Standing by the side  That just don't get asked up  I'm sure you have  Well maybe  Yeah  You think they're standing there like 
[02:39:00]  Bruce just made eye contact with me  You stay here when I hit the stage  I'll come back after the set  They don't necessarily want to be up though  You know  I go to a lot of shows  I want to see the show  You know what I mean  I'm not there  Have you ever been invited up  And not wanted to go up?  Yeah  Did you go up or did you go no?  Yeah no I had to go  It was Prince in Europe  I was in Europe in a club  And you know Prince would do a show  And then he'd go to a club afterwards  I didn't even go to the club  And he couldn't call me up  And I hadn't been playing in years 
[02:39:30]  You know I was over there  You went years without playing?  Oh yeah  Why?  Yeah well in between tours I don't play  Yeah  That's true  Yeah  Anyway I went up you know  And it was okay  It was fun  But I didn't want to go  How much time do you need to get back into  What you would consider fighting shape  When you're going out  Like what do you take a month or so?  Yeah  Yeah I mean  Just go over everything?  Yeah it comes back  You know as you do it of course  But you know  You go through the same pain  Fingers you did when you're 13 years old  Yeah you know

Yeah, when you go  Oh no, there's more candy  Than I ever seen  And they look through the letter slot 
[02:53:30]  And you're standing right there  And you can't get an erection  Because of your goddamn medication  Oh my god  You're pulling as hard as you can now  Salt and pepper wig  Kids think I got hot Turkish taffy in my hand  Yeah, look at this  Here's a little treat for you  And they don't see no candy  They just see newspapers scattered  On the floor  Oh shit  Foot

[03:10:30]  Here's your host  Sam Roberts  Leave it to Ant  To drop a nugget like that  On us at the last  Possible minute  Welcome to After All  Up and Anthony Live  With me  Viral video sensation  King of the internet  Sam Roberts  What I wouldn't give  To be a fly on the wall  At that dinner  Ant had to go to  Last night  Ant had to go  I  There's a  Age difference  Between the lady  That he's seen 
[03:11:00]  The girl  The young lady  I don't know exactly  How to phrase it politely  The person  His companion  That he's with right now  There's an age difference  Between him and her  Say Sal  If both these guys  Are in here  Who's answering the phones  I will start answering the phones  You gotta do everything  Around here huh  Eric's jumping on the board  Now we're just rotating on  And off  These interns  Have no go-to-itiveness  None whatsoever  None  What are you pointing  At the door for  Pull it open  And then walk out of it  Leave the book there

[03:12:00]  I'll do it this once  He said it worked out fine  But I can't imagine  The level of discomfort  That I would have  Going into a situation  Like that  I mean you remember  Just going to a  Girlfriend's  Parents house  When you were young  The first time  Imagine now  If you're doing it  However  X number of years later  And the girl's  Age probably  Hasn't changed that much  I don't know for sure  Some early  What did you learn  Is call up now  866-WOW1-WOW  866-969-1969

[03:13:30]  Cause you know  It really was  Iraq and them  Yeah I would say  It was Iraq's fault  Iraq  What's going on  In there now  We've had  Profit problems  Since Steve Anzant  Came in  So we're still  Working on it  Oh no  Are you saying  That in a religious sense  Yeah we just  Can't find  We keep killing him off  Oh that was a  Madonna reference  That was a callback  Who's that blonde girl  Out there  I can't talk too loud  Because who is that  She looked like  I think she's one of  The new part timers  Oh my god  For what station  Wherever they'll hire her  Wait  I think that's who it is 
[03:14:00]  She's like kind of tall  Not tall tall  But  She's wearing an army jacket  She's kind of rough and tumble  Yeah  Yeah yeah yeah  I think I've seen her  I think she's one of the tall  I don't know  Do you want to invite her in  Well  You want to get to know her  She's talking to somebody  Well you could  I mean  Yeah we could invite her  Somebody more important than you Jim  I like  Anybody that's more important  I don't believe that  I'm only saying it because  Amy Schumer is interviewing  Carol Burnett  Tim Conway  Uh huh  And Vicki Lawrence  And I want to  Get a picture with them  You do  Are you going to stay for the interview  If I can 
[03:14:30]  I have therapy today  But I just  But the picture's what's important  Oh my god  All three of them together  Hi how are you  Welcome  This is Ashley  Hi  Oh hi Ashley  So you guys know each other  Yes yes yes  She went to Syracuse University  Oh  And so like uh  Last summer  She came here  Right before she  Right before she graduated  I don't like the fact that  Ashley purposely sat  Two seats away from me  Because I gave her the creeps  When she walked in  That's the vibe you give off  Like why not sit  A little further back  Yeah  Um  Yeah she came here 
[03:15:00]  You know  Kind of seeking advice  From a Syracuse alumni  Who's  Uh  Gotten a lot of success  In the broadcasting industry  Like me  And so I showed her around  And now she's hired  Oh  You're on mic  You're on my mic  Oh yeah that's why  I was gesturing to this mic  But then you just sat over there  Oh I was just being polite  You kind of like did like  One of the shoe points  No  I was like I thought  Shoe means two points  No no  See what you do  Women take your reference  You're too angry  But I wasn't being angry  I was pointing at the mic  Saying come on  You were shooing  No  No idea  You were scowling  I was pointing at the mic 
[03:15:30]  Saying here  We're on the air  Um  Alright but hold on  Let me just put this one down  So I can actually look across the room  At Ashley  So uh  You went to Syracuse  And who hired you  Who hired me  Meeting like what channel  Oh uh  Talk programming  So basically just all the talk  Whether it's Cosmo upstairs  Or it's out cue  I'm basically just hanging up  On 37  Are you on air  Not really  Sometimes I am  But I kind of just respect the talent  And I do my thing so far  Okay  Do you want to be on air  I wouldn't mind  But I mean  I'm not here to you know 
[03:16:00]  Be the next Aaron Andrews  Or some blonde chick  So I'll work my way  She was the girl from ESPN  Who was photographed  Surreptitiously in her room  I know her  As the girl who got peeped on  Right  Yes  Yes yes yes  Um well  So you're just part time  Here right now then  Yeah I mean I'm pretty much  Full time  But officially part time  I see  So that's a good thing then  Then you're getting a lot of hours  Yeah I mean I was here  About six or seven hours ago  And I commute from Jersey  And now I'm back again  So  Why don't you just stay here 
[03:16:30]  Isn't there an office or something  You could crash in  There's a shower here  It looks pretty nice  There is  Yeah  Where  I think on third  I don't know where  But someone led me to the shower once  With tiles  So that's all I know  Who led you to the shower  I don't know  When I first started interning  Someone said there was a shower here  And then I kind of just said  That's part of the interview process  Yeah  We lead the young female interns  To the showers  Yeah you have to be soaped up  And talk about your duties  Right  We don't allow dirty interns  No I feel so gullible  Has anybody been creepy to you here  No I don't think so 
[03:17:00]  Nobody has  No stalkers  Have you heard about the brown list  No  That's something that  When we first got here  Maybe they don't do it as much anymore  Because when we first got here  From 57th street  That's  People really talked about it  Apparently people keep track of  Of those who go  Number two  Take shits  Without washing their hands after  Oh that's lovely  I don't know if they inform  New interns of that  Or if that's something  They wait for a while  Well that's usually the initiation process here  You gotta take a lot of shits  And then you just don't wash your hands  And you shake everybody's hand  And then you just spread poop around  So you're here at all hours 
[03:17:30]  Oh yeah I'm a night owl here  We realize  We talk about this a lot  On Monday mornings  We come in  And something happens  During the weekend  Where the toilets  At least in the guys bathroom  I don't know if it's the same  For the girls bathroom  But the toilets  In the guys bathroom  Are a wreck  Like people are literally  Making like  Shit teepees  They're covering the toilets  In toilet paper  And then shitting on top of it  It's disgusting  Are you shitting me  Or are you for real  Because that's kind of awesome  I'm for real  That is kind of awesome  I thought that was kind of funny  What goes on here  On the weekends  Hmm  Davey Max here 
[03:18:00]  Huh  Davey Max  The only one around here  And then it's myself  Eastside Dave  Maybe he's shitting all over  All the bathrooms  Where in Jersey  Central New Jersey  What parks  I grew up in North Brunswick  Okay I grew up in South Brunswick  Oh wow  I guess we're supposed to be rivals  Is that right  I don't know  I know you probably always  Kicked our ass anyways  I have zero school knowledge  Your pride  Kicked your ass in what  I don't know  Like what  Is there still  Football  What was the name of your team  We were the North Brunswick Raiders  Whoa  Well you probably did  You'd go in and raid  The other cities of Jersey 
[03:18:30]  Exactly  Raid the kitchen  Terrible  So what was the name  Of your school team  We were the Vikings  But all the girls teams  Got called the Dykes  The Vikes  And all that  Of course  The Dykings  I would call them the Dykings  I would too  It's very funny  I think they called our team  The Raiderettes  Because I think  It's awful  Terrible  Awful  Sam you're turning red  You're embarrassed  Of the Raiderettes  Yeah it's terrible  Yeah it's just awful  I just had a question  Oh yeah that's what 
[03:19:00]  I was going to ask you  So part timers  Like you guys are  Competing for hours  Does it get competitive  With you guys  You're all trying to like  You know kiss the right ass  And figure out what to do  To get the most possible hours  I mean  Because there's only  A certain number of positions  Past part time  You know what I mean  There's x number of part time  And then there's  Far less full time positions  And as you go up the ladder  It gets smaller and smaller  Is there competition  On that level  I mean it's like Survivor  But every day on Pandora  I listen to Drake  Before I come in 
[03:19:30]  You're not supposed to listen  To Pandora every day  Before you come in  I know I'm really sorry  I know they had an ad  Saying to keep listening  To Pandora  And  Who had an ad?  Pandora did  And they were dissing serious  And then I kind of felt bad  For listening to Pandora  But you kept listening  Well the thing is  They had Drake on  And I don't have serious  Because the account  Never set up here at HR  Oh boy  And now you're forcing  Your part timers to go  You know  I mean but if I drove  In the car sure  I don't know  You don't listen to Pandora  Like occasionally  No  It's no good  It's terrible  Here's the problem with Pandora 
[03:20:00]  Everybody goes like  Aren't you worried about Pandora  There's nothing intimidating  About Pandora  Or any  Or iHeartRadio  They're all shit  Because  They're all somebody else's content  Right  The reason you get serious  Is because  Number one  It works flawlessly  In cars  You don't have to try  To get some kind of  Mobile internet thing  Going on  And number two  It's exclusive content  Like where  You don't hear  The Opie and Anthony show  Other places  You don't hear  There's personalities  That you simply  Don't get on something like that  Sam wanted to say  You don't hear  The Sam Roberts show 
[03:20:30]  Anywhere either  Well you don't hear it  On Sirius either  Nobody listens to it  No they do  Yeah  Yeah it's a very popular show  Phone lines notwithstanding  It is a very very popular program  Well there has to be a call to action  The listeners are conditioned  To just listen  Unless I say  Now call in  And then they will  Okay  But I haven't said it  They're in awe of you  In the car  Yeah  There you go  How long have you been  Out of school  Since May  Oh okay  So you're brand new  Are you like 23  22  I'm 22 yeah  Oh okay  That's good  You have plenty of years  Ahead of you 
[03:21:00]  It's crazy  How did you get a job  Right out of school  I started looking for jobs  In January  And I had about 15  To 17 informational interviews  Over spring break  And then I hustle  Hustle hustle  Called called called  And I graduated  Got home from Syracuse  10pm  And showed up here  The next day at 9am  In the morning  See I don't know  Where these interns go to  Because we get interns here  That are horrible  Even Sal  Do you know Sal  Who works for our show  I mean I've heard of Sal  I know he has a tattoo  On his arm  It's terrible  And the only thing 
[03:21:30]  I don't want to diss him  You do?  I can't diss him  I don't know him  Sure here he comes  Sashaying into the room  The only thing worse  Than his tattoo  Is his work ethic  I don't understand  See Sal  Ashley over here  Is not saying  Well this isn't my job  She's sitting there  And going  Well I was hustling  I was going to 15 interviews  Right after college  And blah blah blah  Like let's be honest  We can assess all things  Right now  And realize  That the reason  You got hired so quickly  Out of college  Was simply  Luck  And timing  And the fact  That you have  John Ritter's glasses 
[03:22:00]  From Slingblade  I actually got hired  To the Opie and Anthony show  At the age of 21  And I graduated college early  So I hustled my ass off  You didn't hustle anything  It was just luck  You had terrible interns  Next to you  Yeah that's true  You really did  And then once you got here  It's not like you're making  Any moves to move forward  I am  Are you  Just because I do work  Behind the scenes  It appears that I don't  Do any work  You know what I mean  That's what E-Rock says too  And he really doesn't do any work  That's the old E-Rock  That's because I do Eric's job  Whoa  No we've discussed this before 
[03:22:30]  There's nothing there  Generally speaking  When people say  Just because it appears  That I don't do any work  Doesn't mean I don't  Actually do any work  They're not doing work  That's important  It's true  Like if you're doing work  That's important  People realize  You can't appear to do no work  And do work  And have it be important  Right  The important work's always seen  It's not as exciting work  I should rephrase it  Yeah but even if it's important  It doesn't have to be exciting  If it's really important  Somebody eventually will say  Hey how'd this get done  And somebody would say Sal  But nobody's ever said  Sal got that done 
[03:23:00]  You know what I mean  Yeah well whatever  You can beat up on me all day  It makes you feel better  It does  I mean I don't need to feel better  About myself  I got 1.7 million views on YouTube  Yeah  I don't need to beat anybody up  Yeah that's true  You know  Yeah what was more her  Who got the views  You just kind of  No no no no no  You know  No that's what Rob Cross said  He was like who knew  The fishing was that good  At these apple lines or whatever  And I said it wasn't about the fish  It's about the fishermen  No  Yes it is  It's about  It's about  The person  It's about me  Getting that out in her  Because she's in another video  That somebody 
[03:23:30]  Another thing posted  It's got 3,000 hits  And alright  Almost like you know  The fucking deadliest catch  Is not about the crabs  Right  Exactly  It's about the guys catching them  Okay I see your point  Right  I mean  I'm only here because Amy Schumer's interviewing Carol Burnett  I understand why you're here  It's all I care about is Carol Burnett  Is that what you're thinking about right now?  It's everything I'm thinking about  Do you think  What if you missed the picture?  Well I already got one with her  But I went with all three  For them  All three of them together  Erick is this a high pressure situation for you? 
[03:24:00]  No  As long as I get Jimmy's photo  Everything's alright  That would be  Now she wants to leave  You do?  Why?  No I don't want to be rude  I mean I'm just  I don't know  I don't want to be rude if it's your thing  You know it's your thing  What are you talking about?  I don't know  Am I supposed to still be here?  Sure I know  I mean we're hanging out  I was supposed to get coffee with Roland  He's waiting for me  Why didn't Roland come in here then?  I don't know  I didn't want to be rude and text in the studio  What's more important?  Being on air or to a coffee with a sociopath?  You have Roland  I'd rather have friends before a radio  Because if you have a good foundation 
[03:24:30]  Then everything will work out in the end  That sounds really good  But it's a horrendous philosophy  It's not true  Yeah because eventually all your friends will leave you  Because they'll find careers to move on to  And you'll be sitting there like  Oh I was nice to all these people  And now I got nothing left  I mean I'm always alone in the studio  I'm kind of used to it  I mean I'm here on the weekends  I'm here six days a week  I guess  Jack has a question Jim  Okay  Jack here on After Open Anthony Live  Hey Sammy  Did you say call in  Or were you simply stating you could say call in  Because I'm here for you  No I'm saying you could call in  I didn't actually ask you to  Okay clear it up 
[03:25:00]  Okay thanks  That's what you know  They respond to me  The listeners Jim  Yeah  We got two blinks happening right now  Do you want me  Alright  866-WOW1-WOW  866-969-1969  If you want to talk to Jim Norton  And Ashley  And Sam  Don't use us  To get people to call in  Because that's easy  But you're on the show  I know that  But you basically want them to call in  Because they enjoy your show  Yeah but they enjoy  If you're on the show  Then they can enjoy you too  I really envy Opie  For being in the car right now  Then why are you here  Because I want to meet 
[03:25:30]  Cal Burnett again  Well you don't have to wait here for her  What am I going to do  Sit in the lobby like a fucking  John Hinckley  I got to be somewhere  You can wait in the office  I mean you can talk to  Danny and Travis  I don't know  About what  Posters  Hey what kind of sandwich is that  I mean Roland and I  Were getting coffee  If you wanted to come  Where are you getting coffee  I don't know  I wanted to go to Starbucks  But  Probably won't have enough time  I don't know  I'm going to be here all day  What are you doing today  I'm filling in for a talk show  On OutQ  And then I have my other show  Till 11  And then I got to do all that 
[03:26:00]  Profit swiping  I don't know what any of that means  So basically for all the shows  That you want on demand  On that channel  I have to make sure  They all get delivered  To the people  It's all busy work  Yeah  Does anybody want any shows  On OutQ on demand  I can't say anything  Because that's the channel  I work for  I guess  Now is it difficult for you  To maintain a relationship  Because you're so busy  I guess so yeah  I mean I'm just focusing  On work right now  That's good  Just you know  Developing friends  Because you know  If you enter a relationship  Then your focus is all  Towards there  You lose work 
[03:26:30]  And then you don't  Build up friends  So I can't put my eggs  All in one basket  Okay fair enough  That's right  She answered your question  Then she doesn't have  A boyfriend  No I don't have a boyfriend  I wouldn't dare  Hit on her A  Because she works here  And B  Because I'm wearing  An army sweatshirt  And I haven't shaved  In three days  And I just look  Like a complete creep  It's not only about looks  Jim  That's what I learned  From Troy Kwan  It's about you know  Personality and being charming  It's a good point  Troy though  Hasn't come to terms  With the fact  That he needs to be  Significantly less charming  Than the rest of us  Because he's a good looking guy  He already knows that 
[03:27:00]  He just doesn't want to  It's embarrassing for him  He knows that  He tries to be modest about it  He's no charm at all  Yeah he's not  He's not an electric personality  No not at all  Just has great hair  Just walks in  And you're like  Hey who's the handsome guy  Stash  What's up Stash  Hey what's going on  Sammy  I like this  I like this Angela a lot  She's the exactly  Kind of person you're talking about  She's got lots and lots  Of worth ethics  You know a really good  Head on her shoulders  Now like the other  Interns you had  So tell me something 
[03:27:30]  For me  What's her broad size  Ashley  36C  Okay  Oh my god  Why do you say that Jim  There fine  I'll never see this guy  In my life  What an amazing answer  Yeah but I'm seeing you from here  It's fantastic  It is a good answer  No I stay covered up at work  Thank you  Yeah you do  She's very much  She's wearing like  Almost like a tuxedo shirt  But it's dark blue  And it's tucked in  She has a belt  And blue jeans  It's a very  Don't notice how hot I am 
[03:28:00]  Because she's at work  She wants to be professional  She doesn't want guys  Concentrating on her beauty  You want people to concentrate  On your work ethic  Like we were talking about  The skill level of that work  Things like that  I want to make sure  That my brain  And not my boobs earned it  That's what I'm talking about  Yeah that's fair  She's wearing her watch  On her right hand  And it's kind of a  A big purple watch  It's not  She's not attempting  To have a thin feminine watch  On the left hand  Right right right right  I'm a lefty  I can't wear it on my lefty  Oh are you really  Yeah  Roland you're waiting for coffee  Yes  Yeah  Did you get excited 
[03:28:30]  To take a good day  A little Steven day  Yeah it was great  You didn't know the song  That Jim brought up  I sort of did  But when he looked at me  I got too scared  To say I didn't  I couldn't disagree with him  He didn't know the song  Little Steven didn't know the song  Did you get happy  I knew I was right  When you could prove  Little Steven wrong  Well about a Springsteen song  Yeah  Yeah it was a pretty big deal  It was a solo album  He only played that song  In Pittsburgh  He only plays that song  In Pittsburgh  He only played it once  In Pittsburgh  That's about it  How do you know  What city he played it in  Do you look at the set list  Of every Springsteen show  We all do  That's all the fans  Spencer and myself 
[03:29:00]  Is there like websites  That just post the set list  Yeah backstreets.com  That's where  Like all the writers  And you get like upset  When there's like  A really great set list  That you missed  No not really  I mean he plays  Four hour shows  Doesn't he play  Haven't you heard  Most of the songs  No  No  No  Does he play the same songs  Over and over again  Not really no  Jesus Christ  This guy in this catalog  What's the best  Springsteen song  That you've heard live  That's a tough one  It's like  Who's your favorite kid  No it's not  Because they're not 
[03:29:30]  Your children  Dan  I need coffee  What's up Dan  Yeah the only reason  I'm calling  Is because Jim Norton  Is on the show  Hi sir  Thank you Dan  The only reason  I'm still listening  She's here  No she's not  Okay  1040  Amy's not even here  You haven't texted with Amy  Can we go get coffee now  No you can't go get coffee  We're hanging out  Yeah  I don't know  I mean it's up to her  She could  She could pick  We'll draw the line in the sand  Yeah 
[03:30:00]  There's team Roland  Or there's team  This is the moment  We were talking about this before  When Jim was you know  Asking you about  Your career versus friends  It's like you have  This golden opportunity  To make this amazing radio  That we've been making  The past 15 minutes  Or you could go get coffee  With your friend Roland  You know it's really  That's the crossroads  You're at right now  And it's going to affect  A lot of things  As you move forward  Well I said friends  Before fame  So I will go with Roland  But if you guys liked me enough  Then I'll come back 
[03:30:30]  And that shows that  I did a good job  So then I don't know  No but it also shows  That you're a bad decision maker  Because if you go get coffee  Over being on air  Right  I could lose my spot  Well it's not  It's not  And it's you know  Who chooses coffee  Over being on air  Roland even knows that  Yeah  It's kind of like basketball  I guess  It's either you  You take the bench  For the team  Or you get the pass  And get the winning shot  I guess so  I don't know  Why would you take  The bench for the team  Yeah  I'd take the bench  For the team  Because usually  You know 
[03:31:00]  You scored a lot  That game  You did really well  You want someone else  To step it up  But  What the fuck  Would you do that for  Just keep scoring  It increases your value  So that way  When you get traded  I'm not saying  That I wasn't the greedy one  In high school  Playing in college  But  But then you lost that  Somewhere down the line  I don't know  You gotta keep that  Competitive edge  You gotta get hard  In this business  This is show business  Did he forget his blu-ray  Huh  Yeah  I hope he didn't take  His Little Shop of Horrors  Blu-ray  But I'm gonna keep it  I don't even know  What that movie is about  Little Shop of Horrors  I've never even heard of it  It's about this place  It's okay  It's okay 
[03:31:30]  Stop  I'm still trying to  Pretend that this place  Is butterflies and sunshine  It is for a little while  When you first get here  It's fun  Yeah  I still like it  I mean I've been here for what  Like four or five months  Yeah  Have you really?  Mmhmm  Since mid-May  So it's like five  I mean nobody  I mean nobody  Well you're out of here  At ten o'clock in the morning  I know  You know  You should just hang out  Just be the office guy  Oof  Just chum around with everybody  Yeah  I give him an Indiana Jones hat  And whip  Whip around  Roland  Roland lost his mind  Yeah  Like Roland's walking around  In the afternoons 
[03:32:00]  And he does this  Several times throughout the week  He wears an Indiana Jones hat  And plays with a  Like fake toy whip  Like up and down the halls  Like bosses are walking down here  These are his supervisors  Yeah  And the talent department  Is scurrying around  And Spencer and Liam  And Annabella  They're all looking busy  And everything  And Roland is just  Kibitzing with people  And pretending he's Indiana Jones  This is the same conversation  People had in Chicago  In the 70s  They're like  You know John Gacy  Had a clown outfit  Very strange  But he's a nice guy  He's a nice guy 
[03:32:30]  But he's painting his face now  And he's putting a little  Red nose on  You know what  If it makes him happy  Let him do it  Yeah I'm sure he's not  Until you realize  Roland's buying  Just tons of lime  For his crawl space  Lie  Huh?  Lie  Lime  No  What's lie?  Because you're not making  A fucking beverage  In your crawl space  Yeah but  Lye is like  What you put in your hair  No  Lye is something  That is used in a crawl space  To cover bodies  Even to cover the scent?  Yes  Wow  You're not going to use lime 
[03:33:00]  We all learned  Lime is very fragrant  We all learn new things  Here on After Opie and Anthony Live  Have a spritzer  Frank in St. Louis  Hey how are you doing  This morning guys?  Very well Frank  I'm in Jim  Actually my dear  You sound like a lovely young girl  I will defer to Mr. Martin's  Face and opinion  But if you want to get ahead  In this business  You have to do something  That Sam Roberts doesn't do  Like  Don't start every sentence  I mean  It shows you're coming  From surrogates 
[03:33:30]  Bye bye  What an ass  Yeah I don't know  What he's talking about  He's implying that Sam  Starts every sentence with  I mean  Well people have verbal crutches  It happens  Yes  I mean it's not something  You can help sometimes  I did that one on purpose  Mike in Virginia  Hi guys  What's up Mike?  Hi Mike  Hi  Jim  I was just wondering  If please be offended  It's going to be out on DVD  Anytime soon  Because I really want to see it  Are you Canadian?  No I'm in Virginia 
[03:34:00]  I actually saw you  At the improv in DC  Last time you were here  Yes please be offended  We'll be on DVD  It's coming at Comedy Central  In February I think  Or March  Oh my gosh  They have the second run  And then probably DVD after that  Are you going to do the thing  Where you do DVD immediately after?  Because Comedy Central  They'll put the special on  And then put the DVD out  A week after  I don't know  Well I own this one  They don't  So I don't know  I would love to put it out immediately  Yeah  This is a great call  Great call  Brian  Yeah Sam  You're getting beat up 
[03:34:30]  And I just don't understand it  You give us access  To amazing guests  Like Jim Norton  That's right  Saw you last Friday night  At the Funny Bone  Thank you  You absolutely killed it  Thank you  Story I think  You can appreciate though  Afterwards  I got my picture with you  And my piece of shit  Phone  Hit the wrong button  Didn't save it  I think that was probably  Operator error  I don't think phones  Hit the buttons  Yeah I don't  I can't relate to that  Because I've never been  In that position 
[03:35:00]  Where I would allow  That to happen  All I wanted to do  When I came up  To take the picture  Was come up to me  And tell you  Let me show you  How a big boy loves you  Yeah  Good boy  Creepy  Sure  Taylor  Yeah  Sam was actually right  For once  Amazingly enough  It's actually lime  That you use  To get rid of a body  Not lye  Lye you use  The cost of temper  You can dissolve shit with  But lime  The chemical  Not the fruit  Will decompose the body  Mass ascent  Things like that  That's why the thing  Is a shovel  And six bags of lime 
[03:35:30]  Will take care of those problems  No you put lye in a coffin  You put lye in the ground  Um  Not lime  Yeah but if you want to cover  I bet it's lime  Now I'm gonna  It's lime  I'm gonna stick with my  Original thing then  Go right ahead  Listen to Frank  Just because you beat  Little Steven today  Doesn't mean you're gonna beat me  Frank  Yeah  Jimmy I hate to disagree with you  And I despise agreeing with Sam  It happens  It's powdered limestone  It decomposes bodies  Covers the scent  Covers the scent  Also use lye 
[03:36:00]  To dissolve dead bodies  Look up  I'm looking that up online  But he didn't dissolve the bodies  He was covering the scent  Um  No but he put it  He covered the bodies with you  Look up lime  Look up lime  Let's see  What did John Gacy use  Yeah yeah yeah  To cover up the bodies  Wait till you see this Ashley  If he used this  Wait till you see this  Yeah I don't even know what happened  John Wayne Gacy  Yeah  He killed a bunch of young men  And boys  He was a clown  He dressed up as a clown  Named Pogo  And uh  He sexually assaulted them  He tricked them  He tied them up  Sexually assaulted them 
[03:36:30]  And then murdered them  It was you know  30 plus  Young men  33  He was having a bad day  Most of them  He buried in the crawl space  Under his house  And he used lime  To cover up  The scent of rotting bodies  I don't know if he used  Either of those things  So messed up  Uh  But he might have used lime  We're starting to shift more  Towards my direction  No we're not  So right now you're one and one  One victory  Against little Steven  Looks like one loss  Against Sam Roberts  Not at all  But he wasn't in the album 
[03:37:00]  Though little Stevie  So that's kinda  Doesn't matter  He still did  No no  That one Jim won  Because he said  Completely  He said that song  He made reference  Like Jim was a crazy person  And that song doesn't exist  And then Jim said  Okay  Alright Van Zant  And Eric  Hit the track away  Yeah Eric  Why didn't you just tell  Jim in his ear  That you had the song  When he was poking  Poking his earbuds  To the microphone today  Well one  I didn't know he was  Going to play it  Off his earbuds  I thought he was  Just looking for the title  And two  I was in there  Taking photos 
[03:37:30]  And ran back in  When Jim started  Talking about the song  Oh E-Rock  Whatever  The guy wants to  Fix the door Sam  He can fix the door  Yeah fix it  We broke the doorknob  Off the studio door today  I opened the door  And pulled the doorknob off  Yeah fix the door  No problem  Joe  Yes sir  What's up buddy  You're both correct  Yeah we both are  Yeah both of you  Are absolutely correct  And Jim  Yes  Talk stroke almost  Gave me an aneurysm  Sorry  Thank you  Thank you  John 
[03:38:00]  Yeah we're both correct  Yeah what's up  Hi John  How you doing  Good  Listen lie  You gotta put the body  In the barrel  You gotta keep it  At about 350  For about 4 hours  Okay  The lime helps  Decomposition in the ground  But what you wanna do  Is you don't wanna waste it  That's a long period  You're talking 3 to 4 weeks  3-4 hours  The whole body  I don't know what he's talking about  I'm gonna hang up on  He's saying lie works better  But I think  I think the bottom line here  Is we're both right  Yes  That makes me feel good 
[03:38:30]  Which means  When you said I was wrong  You were wrong  Correct  And I never said you were wrong  So technically  I get the extra point there  Not really  Cause we were both right  But yeah  But you said I was wrong  And you were wrong about that  Okay  So you're right  I'll accept that  Where's your guess  I thought they were coming at 10.30  10.45  Oh  Cameron is not getting here  Until 11.30  Oh so  Amy is getting here  At 10.45  Yeah  I don't see your name  But you have a question 
[03:39:00]  For  What happened to this phone  What happened to line three  I love how uncomfortable  She is right now  Ashley  No I'm not  But you guys talk about  This lie in this line  What is this  You pick it up for $75  At Home Depot  And we just annihilate people  I don't know  I'm not used to talking  This kind of talk  You throw it in a  Let's say  They're fixing the door  You pick someone up hitchhiking  And they don't want to  Do what you want to do  So you have to kill them  You put them in a ditch  Okay  Right  And you cover the body  With lye  Or lime 
[03:39:30]  Yes  One of the two  I've never heard lime  Lye is what you throw  Wait you're not as well  Traveled as me  No  You haven't had the life  Experiences that I have  You just didn't know  What lye is  You didn't know  You thought lime  Is just something  You put in drinks  And I was right  That's all it is good for  No because it's a chemical too  But  Or you know  If you're having sex  With people of the same sex  But you're so ashamed of it  That you can't handle it  And you kill them  What are you going to do  You know what I mean  You have to find a chemical  To cover it up  Or the neighbors  Start questioning things  Once the neighbors 
[03:40:00]  Start questioning things  The police are involved  Right so you got to put  Lye on the body  You understand  And where do you pick it up from  Home Depot  Yeah it's just  It's just a chemical  It can be used for other things  Is the door fixed  Garden department right  Oh the garden department  Yes the door guy knows  The creepy door guy  Knows exactly  As he violently hammers  That doorknob in  He has what looks like  Cranberry juice  All over his shirt  And over his fingernails  It's a cran apple  Yeah  That's my favorite drink  Is it?  Yeah  Do you find it necessary  To drink a lot of  Cranberry juice? 
[03:40:30]  Well if you've ever seen  The movie The Departed  You know  He's like  I got my cranberry juice  He's like  What are you a woman?  And I was  Yeah  As a matter of fact  I am a woman  You are correct  God I didn't know  You should probably hang out  Out queue with me  It's good for UTIs  All right  The door is fixed  That means we are free  To come and go  As we please  Thank you mister  Thank you  Now I can get my coffee  No no no no  You should stay  Because this is good  Exposure for you  But if she wants her coffee  You can't make somebody stay  No  I mean  I'm saying my advice  Would be  To stay and enjoy 
[03:41:00]  The exposure  And realize that  This is the moment  That could take you  To the next level  But  But management  Doesn't listen  Yeah but the world  Outside of here  Is listening  And that's what's important  Managing around now  They're just like  For instance  I have 1.7 million views  On YouTube  Something like that  That's pretty sick  It's the world  Outside of here  Roland  I directed that  You didn't direct anything  You held a camera for me  Roland is taking full credit  For directing and producing  That's right  You held a camera  It's called Hollywood  That's what they do  What did you do

[03:47:00]  A little bit today  You did kind of make it clear  To all your personal friends  That you value air time above them  Which they might take  To be a little bit shitty  Maybe  I asked Roland in two minutes  And you have a guest at 1045  So promptly it's 1043  There's no guest here  I'm meeting Amy in the lobby  I'm just walking off this  Fucking abomination  To see my friend  And I don't shit on my friend  Amy's coming right here right now  Oh is Amy here?  No way  See  Done  Hi Amy  Welcome Amy  I have to go to the bathroom  And then go back there  But I'm here  Okay

She's not here yet  No I know  She's here in a while  Oh okay  But you have good questions  You look very nice  For your interview  Thank you  I thought you were going to say  You look very nice for you  No  I was like oh  Alright thanks  Amy's going to drop a deuce  And then go in there  And interview Carol Burnett  Drop the whole number two  She's nodding  Yes  She's nodding  She's going to go in there  And fire a fucking  Horsetail sized log  She's got the nervous  I'm about to interview  Carol Burnett shits  And Tim Conway  And Vicky Lawrence  Oh my god  I know I'm so excited  You're going to be a part of that?  Well she's coming in 
[03:48:00]  For the interview  On our OutQ channel  Just Carol?  No and the gang  Tom and Vicky  They're doing a lot of shows?  Tim and Vicky  Tim Conway  Yeah  Are they doing a lot of shows?  Today I think they're scheduled  For four or five  Yeah  But they literally  Rollins said they were  Doing press until like 10.55  They couldn't  And they're not coming  Yeah they're doing  They're only doing like 10 minutes  And what are they doing  The town hall thing first?  I think it's 11.30  I already watched the infomercial  What's the infomercial?  I don't know  The three of them  Were on an infomercial  Last night when I got home  At 2  Well you know  They're actually famous  For a television show 
[03:48:30]  It's not just the infomercial  That they're famous for  I was watching  Eunice  The Carol Burnett  Character Eunice  With Vicky Lawrence  And this was a sketch  With Harvey Korman  Played her husband  And it's when she does  The gong show  And she sings  Feelings on the gong show  Carol Burnett  Is one of the fucking  Funniest people  Ever  You used to watch the show  Childhood Idol  Idol  I love her  What happened to sitcoms  That like  Well she did a variety show  She didn't do a sitcom 
[03:49:00]  She did a one hour variety show  It was all sketches  Oh okay  It was from 67 to 78  I think  And it was just her  And she was  She was just hilarious  And the cast was great  That's where that like  Guy's laughing  And breaking character  Came from  That was what  Harvey Korman  And Tim Conway  Would do  And Vicky Lawrence  Was the only cast member  There from 67 to 78  Since Carol  And it was probably  Actually funny  When they would  Break character  And laugh through the skits  Like on SNL  They kind of just do it  Every single episode  Just for  Well that was only 
[03:49:30]  Fallon  It's the best show  The best sketch show  I think ever  Really  I don't think it's  Really  A funnier sketch show  Than Carol  But no  She won  How many  Either 25 or 32  Emmys they won  It's an untouchably  Funny show  What did you think  Of Richard Pryor's  TV show that he did  For what it was  I liked the roast  At the end  Where Pryor just kind of  Went up there  And just shit on everybody  For 17 minutes  With no script  And he was alluding  To Mooney being gay  It was very funny  Calling him Miss Fang  The sketch show  Was decent  There was a funny bit  About a black president  Yeah  But again  He was so handcuffed 
[03:50:00]  He did four episodes  And left  Because he couldn't do  What he wanted to do  So I don't fault Pryor  For that  I mean the networks  Suck now  They were worse than  As far as content  Was Vicky Lawrence  The one that played Mama  The one with the wig  That's what I watched  As a kid  I think it was like  A spin off show  Well the sitcom  That was not Carol  As Eunice though  No  It was different Eunice  But that was  That was Mama  Right  That's what I grew up with  Oh right  And it wasn't  Harvey Korman either  Was that show good  Mama's Family  Oh my god  I was dying  I don't know  I was like 11 years old  Yeah  It might have been okay  But have you ever seen  Carol Burnett do Eunice  Maybe like once or twice 
[03:50:30]  But I can barely remember  And I'm not gonna lie  So I don't remember  So they took the character  And did a spin off sitcom  With a different actress  Well Carol probably  Didn't want to do it  I'm sure  Yeah yeah yeah  And then Vicky Lawrence  Is also famous for singing  The night the lights  Went out in Georgia  Yeah  You know that right  Yeah yeah  That's  I don't know that  Do you have that E-Rock  Tim Conway  Dwarf Ungol  Well yeah  He did Dwarf  Tim Conway was also  In McHale's Navy  You know and of course  The Carol Burnett Show  He was only there  For three years though  Do you know what they're doing 
[03:51:00]  Ron and Fez  They probably are  I think  Are they  I don't know  I think they might be  I'm not sure  Do we have that E-Rock or no  I have Vicky Lawrence singing it  Yeah  He wasn't listening  No he was  That's what  I thought it was both of them  Sorry  He didn't  You never heard this  I don't think so  This was a fucking massive hit  From McHale Lawrence  In the mid 70s I think  Okay  What year  He was on his way home from Candletop  Been two weeks gone  And he thought he'd start  And she went on to play Big Mama  Or Mama  Well I'm guessing this was after 
[03:51:30]  Because she was on that show  For so many years  Yeah  But this is like a song song  Oh yeah  Not like a comedy song  Oh no  It's a real song  About an innocent guy being  Hung or something  For shooting  I'm not your best friend  Yeah she has me right  She has no right  Oh good  Alright  Ashley wants to get out of here  She's hating us  You're leaving?  I have a show to do at 11  Okay  You gotta get prepared for it  Alright one last time then  What's your Twitter handle  So everybody can follow you  And suggest new names 
[03:52:00]  My Twitter handle is  Nacho  Typic  Chip  What's that?  Hold on now  We got  We uh  I'm making sure I did it right  How many followers do you have?  Probably like  It was like 70 before?  Yeah  No wait  What's going on?  Oh yeah that is you  You have 333 followers  Yeah right  What?  Yeah this is where  And it gets weird too  Like girls never really realize it  Like  The strangers that listen to our show  Are weirdo strangers 
[03:52:30]  I mean I have people from Al Q  And they're calling drunk all the time  Cause the show's till 11pm  Yeah but I mean  The vicious, horrible, monstrous people  That listen to this channel  Some are mean to Roland  I see on Instagram  No I mean they're just  They're like nobody else in radio  They'll be nice to her though  She's nice  I mean you'll have a couple of dicks  But most  You're very nice  Most of them will be nice to you  I would hope so  I mean I'm not starting any beef with anybody  How tall are you?  I'm 5 foot 9 and a half  Okay so you're 5'10  And that  What position did you play?  I played shooting guard  Are you a fantasy 
[03:53:00]  A fan of  Like the Liberty  Or any of those bands?  Bands  Bands?  I'm sorry  Like the WNBA?  Yeah  I kind of like it  But then it has like the stigma  Of all the lesbians and butches around  Which I kind of find intimidating  You find lesbians intimidating?  Sometimes  Like when I used to play  They used to like pinch my butt and stuff  And it would be really awkward  Really?  Yeah  Yeah  It's very uncomfortable  Fight through the turn on  I understand  Yeah  Alright I'm gonna go see Amy  Alright buddy  Alright I'm heading out too  Thanks  Oh it's nice to meet you  Okay  Ashley it was a pleasure 
[03:53:30]  Thanks Sam  Roland  Are you gonna go get coffee with Roland?  Yes  As I said I would  Yeah  You got time to do that?  It's gonna be a rushed coffee date though now  Eh  Is it okay?  Yes  I  No  I'll probably see him again later  I'm here for like 16 hours  It's crazy  I know  Alright  Thank you very much Sam  Bye  Thank you for stopping by Ashley  My guy  And the door's fixed now  So that's our just right  Okay  What's going on?  Roland what are you warning him of?  Something about your stupid ass video  I directed  Son of a bitch  Let's get the fuck out of here Roland  Jim good luck getting that photo 
[03:54:00]  Good luck  Good luck getting that photo  What did you think of Ashley?  She's really nice  She is very nice  She's obviously new  Yeah  Green as they say  Renvy  Yeah I thought that was coming Chip  I definitely thought that was coming  You saw that one coming?  Yeah I did  I did  You think she picked up on the fact that  Chip responds to his name?  I don't think she knew what was going on  No I don't think so either  Tell Iraq to meet me out there when he can  Cause uh  You know  Not now but after  Yeah  Okay are you ready for this Iraq? 
[03:54:30]  This is a big photo  You know  You try  What do you try to just low key this thing?  No  I've done big photos for him before  What's the biggest photo you've done for Norton?  Well  We did Cal Burnett  Yeah but this is  Two years ago  This is bigger than Carol Burnett  This is Carol Burnett  It's the whole cast of the show though  Yeah  It's bigger than just her  She's included  It's bigger than just her correct?  Okay  If you  I guess  What are you being argumentative for?  It's obviously bigger than just her  Correct?  Sure  How is it not?  It is 
[03:55:00]  Then why are you being argumentative?  Cause you're  I don't know  We're killing time  No I don't need you to just argue for the sake of arguing  I got lots of things to talk about  Yes it's bigger than Carol Burnett  So what's the biggest picture that you've taken for Jim?  For Jim  Um  Probably  Sabbath  Yeah  Well  You know  Yeah when they were all in  The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame picture?  No that was  That was Earl  That's the biggest picture he's ever taken  Yeah but I did the other version of Sabbath with Dio 
[03:55:30]  Oh at K-Rock  Uh  Was it K-Rock or XM?  I think it was K-Rock  Cause they did both  I think they did both  But I think the picture is in the hallway at K-Rock  That was when they were technically Heaven and Hell  Yeah I think so  I mean that  Okay that was a big picture  That was a huge deal  Do you consider that a bigger deal than this?  Sabbath yeah  I think so too  Yeah  Even though it's Dio  And Jim said it  You know  Childhood hero Carol Burnett  Still doesn't replace  You know where Ozzy ranks in his life  Right  The only thing bigger I think than Ozzy would be a president 
[03:56:00]  But this isn't Ozzy  That you were talking about  No  This was Sabbath with Dio  But still  I think  I think that is probably bigger  Were you nervous to take that picture?  Uh yeah  Cause he was directing everybody  He's yelling at Steve and me in the hallway  And I guess this photo  Cause Norton is so  Specific about these photos  They mean the world to him  You've heard him  He flips the fuck out if this doesn't go right  It was back in the time  Where he still wasn't fully trusting anyone taking his photo  Right  Where I kept having to take test shots  And show them the white balance  And run the markers on paper 
[03:56:30]  So he could see that they weren't too dry  Or leaking over anything he was signing  And it becomes a lot more difficult too  When it's not a posed photo  You know what I mean  Like this will probably  You'll have time to do a posed photo  Like with Heaven and Hell  When they were here  Sabbath  It was like  Oh let me grab them  While they're in the hallway all together  Like there wasn't a backdrop  They weren't taking pictures for Getty  I'll tell you  You know what  There was something recent  That was a high pressure photo for Jim  And was it  Meaning for you too?  Um  For Jim and for me 
[03:57:00]  Yes  Because I had to take a photo of  It could have been an either or situation  Because he has a tendency of shifting his  Uh stress onto whoever is near him  Yes but this was something that was out of his hands  Oh  So it's either Jim's gonna get this photo  Or he's not gonna get this photo  And he's not the type of person  That's just like  Well you know what  It's out of my hands  I'll let the universe control it  And I had to document either way  What do you mean either way?  If Jim was getting blown off  I had to make sure I had a photo of him being blown off  Because a celebrity would be near him 
[03:57:30]  Because  Well that and Jim would have proof  To rant the next day  You know when he had a story  That look this asshole blew me off  So what was the picture?  Um  Art Garfunkel  That was just like  That was two days ago  Two days ago  Whenever he was on Ron and Fez  Yeah  And um  We were waiting for a while  We didn't know if this was going to happen  Especially since  We're trying to get a photo  Before he does all the interviews  Right  Right  So as soon as he got off the elevator  And we had heard that 
[03:58:00]  You know  That he can be kind of moody  To the extent that  He doesn't want to sign anything  Doesn't want to take any photos  So we didn't know  Which version of the guy  Was going to come up  But uh  We had to document whether  You know  When Jim approached him  Was he gonna get the photo?  Um  Great  If not  I had to have some proof  That he was being blown off  Well I remember  And he got it  We got both  You got him  How could you get both?  You couldn't get him being blown off  I had the camera running  When he approached  And  Got the official photo  Where they posed together 
[03:58:30]  Was he in a good mood?  Art?  Um  Art Garfunkel?  Honestly he didn't seem like  He wanted to take a photo with anybody  But he did it  I was  It's the same  It wasn't for Jim  It was just for me  But when Jack White was here  Months ago  Whatever it was  April I guess  I don't really remember  He didn't want to take the photo  But he did it?  Well no  I didn't know if he would though  Because like  Jack White is a very  To me anyway  He strikes me as a very mysterious  Sort of  Artsy guy  Like he's not  Very reclusive  Yeah he's a reclusive guy  He doesn't get out there 
[03:59:00]  And get as much sort of  Dumb press as he can  He does weird stuff  Like he  You know  He gets  When his single got released  He just hung out  In his own record store  And he put the single  On like  Bendable vinyl  And then he launched  His single  In a thousand balloons  And just let the balloons  Throughout Nashville  And that was it  That's what he did  Like he just does weird stuff  And he doesn't do a lot of interviews  And he only does  What he really wants to do  So I didn't know  What was going to happen  And he did one interview  And it was late in the afternoon 
[03:59:30]  Up here  And generally  When a celebrity comes up  Late in the afternoon  For one interview  They don't really want to do a lot  Like they're not on a press tour  And it's usually  A high priority thing  Where they're in  Just to do  One thing  Specific thing  And they have to run out  To go do something else  And the boss is  Like a concert or something  Right  And the boss is around here  Especially when it's somebody  Who's as big as Jack White is  The bosses around here  Are very sort of antsy  Making sure everything's okay  And I had heard  That sometimes he doesn't  Mind signing things  Sometimes he doesn't  Like to sign things  And my plan was to 
[04:00:00]  Ask him to sign my arm  So if you're not in a good mood  And some little douche  Comes up to you  And says  Will you sign my arm  A no is going to be  Your first immediate response  And how did that work out  For you  Well Eric  As I showed  Little Steven Van Zant today  What?  It worked out pretty  God damn well  Because I have his name  His autograph  His signature  Tattooed on my left arm  Jack White  I believe it also made  Rolling Stone  Didn't it?  Well rollingstone.com  But you know  In 2012  It's all .com  Isn't it?  Who reads magazines anyway?  It's all about rollingstone 
[04:00:30]  .com  How many hits did that get?  Not a million  Not 1.7 million  That's for damn sure  Not 1.7 million  And growing  I knew I had made it today  By the way  I'm also well aware  That by Friday  Hula Hoop Girl  Will have stolen  Any traction  That I had on the viral web  This is going away  And it's never coming back  But  Let me enjoy it for right now  DJ Wonder  From Shade45  Said  Dude  I saw you on  World Star Hip Hop yesterday  You finally crossed over  I was like  Yes  I finally did it  They're accepting you  As one of their own
