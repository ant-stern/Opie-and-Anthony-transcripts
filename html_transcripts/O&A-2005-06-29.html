<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the hosts and Jim Norton's usual irreverent banter, punctuated by a caller's story about police mistaking a UPS package for a truck window.  They discussed their online presence, including fan sites and pirated broadcasts. The conversation then turned to President George W. Bush's recent speech, specifically focusing on an anecdote about his underage daughter being denied entry to a bowling alley. This sparked a reminiscence about their own youthful exploits involving underage drinking and visits to strip clubs, described in graphic detail.  They recounted a humorous attempt to use a library card as fake ID.

Returning to Bush's speech, the hosts criticized its lack of substance and overuse of 9/11 references. This segued into a discussion about high gas prices, prompted by a trucker caller detailing his financial struggles.  The conversation then shifted to their "Whip Them Out Wednesday" segment and listener sticker requests.  A caller challenged the hosts' views on the Iraq War, accusing the Bush administration of dishonesty.  This led to a discussion of international gas prices and calls from Canadian listeners, which were frequently interrupted by crude jokes and commentary from the hosts. The segment concluded with a discussion of hybrid cars, celebrity car collections, a briefly mentioned pop culture quiz prepared by an intern, and a tangent on "shadow people" from the Art Bell show.

The next segment began with the “shadow people” discussion, contrasting the mundane daily lives of brilliant people like Michio Kaku (whom Opie had encountered) with their intellectual pursuits.  This transitioned into a discussion of online shopping conveniences (Drugstore.com, FreshDirect.com) versus in-person shopping, followed by Opie describing his elaborate home security system.  The pop culture quiz was then attempted, interrupted by a listener suggesting peapod.com and Opie's joking mention of a urine jar collection.  Listener-submitted news teases were then ridiculed, leading to a digression about a radio host claiming to have invented various things, including "wow."  The hosts promoted their "Whip Him Out Wednesday" segment (involving women flashing their breasts to drivers with "WOW" stickers, with a disclaimer against harassment) and announced a Manhattan sticker distribution event with exotic dancers.  A lengthy discussion about Opie's pronunciation of "but" ensued, followed by detailed planning of the sticker distribution, including a potentially controversial location.  This was followed by a rant about a mealy orange and a discussion about their interns who handled their food orders. A listener then pointed out Anthony's mispronunciation of "olden," prompting a debate on pronunciation pet peeves.  The segment ended with a mocking dissection of overblown news coverage of a shark found in Rockaway Beach, complete with humorous shark-themed role-playing.

The following segment focused on the Rockaway Beach shark, highlighting discrepancies between news reports and featuring vulgar commentary on a female reporter's appearance.  A heated exchange with a listener, Pete DeFelice, whose call wasn't aired, ensued, filled with insults.  This was followed by crude humor about a man found in a porta-potty filled with human waste. The accidental playing of Gary Glitter's "Rock and Roll Part 2" caused a brief panic.  A story about a nude, masked man attempting rape in the Hamptons was discussed with vulgar commentary, alongside a call from a woman whose dog bit her vagina.

The next segment began with a discussion about aggressive driving, specifically using the shoulder lanes, and a caller, Joe the Trucker, sharing similar frustrations. This abruptly shifted to a vulgar and sexually explicit discussion about labiaplasty and vaginoplasty, featuring crude comments from the hosts and callers about the procedures and female genitalia.  A "Guess What's in My Pants" segment failed due to the caller's misunderstanding.  The segment concluded with a pop culture quiz where Jim Norton performed poorly, resulting in laughter and mockery.

The final segment featured a pop culture quiz where Jim Norton unexpectedly won.  A Beatles trivia request led to a sexually explicit anecdote.  A discussion followed about a Newsday publisher arrested for possessing child pornography, detailed graphically.  Audio from Greta van Susteren's interviews about the Natalee Holloway case, focusing on a DJ's contradictory statements, was played.  The show ended with callers sharing humorous and vulgar one-liners.

[00:00:30]  Thank you. 
[00:01:00]  Thank you. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  Thank you. 
[00:04:00]  We're the only radio show that makes you want to hate us.  Opie.  I want my coffee.  Anthony.  I want that back.  Jim Norton.  I want Ozzy.  We're going to dumb this thing down to the point that we're going to be number one with Down Syndrome children.  Don't do it.  Don't do it.  Don't do it.  It's terrible.  The opening and end of the show.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  For many days, I didn't bring him here because I suffer when he bites me. 
[00:04:30]  I'm in my vagina.  When I'm walking and he sees this other dog, right away, he jumps on my vagina because he gets so crazy.  He doesn't know who I am.  He forgets everything.  He buys the labrador and his penis.  I don't want him to buy my labrador and his penis.  My labrador is a baby.  It's beautiful.  I've seen the cops knocking the truck window out and I thought they was giving the man UPS. 
[00:05:00]  I thought the man was dead.  That's the way it was.  Where did you get that from?  I heard that one this morning.  I don't know who called that one, but bravo.  Jesus Christ.  Listen to this woman.  I've seen the cops knocking the truck window out and I thought they was giving the man UPS.  I thought the man was dead.  That's the way it was.  Giving him UPS. 
[00:05:30]  Hello, exactly.  Yeah.  UPS.  That's funny.  I'm funny.  Jesus.  Come on.  Classic.  I thought they was giving the man UPS.  I'm Steve, of course, runs right in and goes, video of that is on the website.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  You are.  Absolutely.  Go to foundrymusic.com and opianthony.com to see the video of what Anthony just played.  Hawking.  I like the fact that you can download a lot of the videos on Foundry. 
[00:06:00]  Videos of the sound clips.  Whatever goes on in this studio.  And then stuff like fun little videos that people send us.  This show is high tech, I'm telling you.  It is.  It's got a lot of little facets to it.  You know, the show is obviously the central hub, but there's so many little peripheral  bits of entertainment you can get on the web.  It's just pretty cool.  Anthony and I could retire tomorrow.  Mm-hmm.  And this show will go on for another ten years. 
[00:06:30]  Oh, I know.  Just rolling along in reruns or something.  I discover stuff about this show almost on a weekly basis.  Yeah, there's just things going on out there.  There's a whole other Opie and Anthony show being played every day.  Yeah.  Every day, illegally on the internet.  Yeah.  Of all our old shows.  We're on the air.  You know, there are people that don't have XM, that probably have no idea we are on the  air, that listen to us on a daily basis, stuff we did years ago.  Years ago.  Because we encouraged our listeners years ago to tape all our shows. 
[00:07:00]  Yeah.  And to trade them, kind of like the Grateful Dead did back in the day.  Yeah.  So that's what they did.  And then they started fan sites.  And there's old shows from like 1998.  And all of a sudden you get an email about something you did in 1998, 99.  Dude, that was funny, that thing you did.  What?  When you guys shocked that girl that time.  What?  What?  Oh, yeah.  I remember that.  And then you got OAVirus.com.  He's throwing up clips of old stuff every day and it's getting nuts.  Then eBay is selling our stuff every day. 
[00:07:30]  I like it.  It's kind of cool.  This whole little subculture going on.  A little second life of this show.  We got lots to do once again today.  Lots to do.  Plenty of little tidbits in the news.  Well, I watched Bush last night.  You did?  Hell yeah.  Like everyone else.  Nice.  I like one.  What was our name?  Oh.  You just laid there watching Bush.  The president. 
[00:08:00]  Mm-hmm.  On the television last night.  And a little side story.  Yeah.  His daughter was celebrating her 21st birthday in New York City.  Aw.  And I guess she had a huge celebration at this club called 21.  Ben could come in.  Ben knows.  Dog, 21.  I know that.  Ben knows everything about.  Tom Brady goes there.  About New York City.  But basically, the night before, I guess when she had her party at 21, for her 21st birthday,  she was actually 21.  Uh-huh.  Okay?  So it was a huge bash, I guess.  Whatever.  And all the, uh, all the who's who's were invited, right? 
[00:08:30]  Of course.  But the night before, the president's daughter was at, uh, what is it called?  Ball, uh, Ballmore.  Uh, Ballmore or whatever?  Hmm.  I don't know.  It's like that retro bowling that they do.  Yeah.  And, uh, and they wouldn't, the bouncer wouldn't let her in because she wasn't 21.  Wasn't 21 yet.  And I bet you the bouncer had no idea that he was basically telling the president's daughter,  sorry, you can't come in.  Probably not.  Knowing that, uh, the next day she was going to be 21.  Although, aren't there Secret Service agents and everything with her all the time? 
[00:09:00]  You gotta think, right?  You would absolutely think that a bowling, a goddamn bouncer at a bowling alley would see  that, uh, the Secret Service guys.  Yeah, but these bouncers at all these clubs and these hotspots, they think their shit  don't stink.  More than Secret Service?  Oh, yeah.  So they're probably really happy that they were the ones that told her she couldn't come  in, you know?  Maybe because she's so high profile and young.  People would, everyone knows how old she is if she's in there.  Everyone knows an underage person is in there.  That's true.  Because her age is common knowledge.  Yeah.  I'm just thinking, how many people are, you know, all right, come in. 
[00:09:30]  What the hell?  I know this license looks ridiculously fake or this license looks like your older brother,  but I don't give a fuck.  I know you have to make a cutoff point somewhere, but one day before your birthday, how much  different of a person are you going to be the next day?  That's complete just technicality.  I think it's only hours from her birthday, because she probably was, you know, right around  midnight going there, right?  Yeah.  But that's always been ridiculous.  But then how far back do you go?  What, a week?  A month?  You know?  Right.  Like, ah, it's my birthday next month. 
[00:10:00]  What am I going to be, a different person?  I get more responsible?  I can drink then?  I once tried to get into a bar with my library card.  Oof.  I was, uh...  Ouch.  See, when we were growing up, kids, the drinking age was 18.  18!  What a fine, fine time that was.  Oh.  Drinking martinis, me, Groucho, Zeppo.  And a very smart time, by the way.  Zeppo.  Very smart to have the drinking age at 18.  Yeah.  Incredibly smart. 
[00:10:30]  Because kids are going to do that drinking no matter what.  They're going to be smoking that pot no matter what.  Booting that heroin.  But the problem is, because a lot of these kids can't get into the bars, well, now they're  drinking here and there, and doing the house parties and all that, whatever.  But more importantly, I would love to do a study.  I bet you drug use has gone way the fuck up since they changed their drinking age.  Opie, you're so glib.  You don't...  You haven't done the studies.  I have.  I have.  Opie, Opie, Opie. 
[00:11:00]  Tool.  I'm thinking that kids are popping a lot more pills than we were when we were growing up.  Yeah?  Yeah, I'm thinking that.  Like the Vicodin and stuff?  All that, because, you know, they don't have a place to hang.  Like, we got to go to bars at 18.  How cool was that?  That was pretty cool.  And 18 was the age, so you were getting in at 17, sometimes even 16.  Do you remember, what the hell was it called?  Oh, my God.  It was on 25A.  It was at Howard Johnson's, and they had a little bar. 
[00:11:30]  Tom Collins, they called the bar, something like that.  I'm trying to remember.  Anyway, I was the dude that didn't turn 18 until real late in the school year.  And all my friends were 18, and one of my friends was 6'5", and then grew a beard during  fourth period, that kid.  He was driving at 15, which I still don't understand, because I think the driving age  was like 16.  But I think his parents were like, ah, he's already an adult, right?  So they all had their licenses, and, you know, I'm trying to get in with them. 
[00:12:00]  And another one of our friends, he wasn't 18 either, and he got like a hunting license,  and he dockered that up.  And my friends were like, don't worry, dude, you know, you'll just be in the crowd, and  just show them something.  Just show them something.  So I remember like docking my, messing with my library card, and throwing a date of birth  or something on there.  They looked at me like, oh, God.  Oh, a library card?  Will you just go home? 
[00:12:30]  Yeah.  Don't embarrass yourself, kid.  Exactly.  Go home.  Yeah, it wasn't even a scene.  Drink at the house.  They looked at me and just said, stop.  Just go.  And I was the last guy in.  So, you know, your friends don't give a fuck.  They got in.  Yeah.  They're not coming outside.  Oh, what happened, man?  Oh.  I used to go to the tip bar across the street, the Tender Trap.  Across the street from my house.  I lived right across the street from the Tender Trap.  I had no idea about that.  Yeah, there's a side street right behind Fred's Diner. 
[00:13:00]  Yeah.  Right there.  There's a side street.  I knew you lived in that area.  I had no idea it was that close to the Tender Trap.  Oh, yeah, it was right there.  I used to walk there at like 16.  I would walk over to the Tender Trap and sometimes all I would have is a pocket full of quarters.  And I guess the bartender was really cool because a kid walking in there, sitting down, plopping a bunch of quarters on the bar and saying,  could I have a Budweiser?  And then I'd get my beer and the thing would be like hot by the time I was done with it because I would just sit there nursing one beer for about an hour and a half, two hours. 
[00:13:30]  Right.  Squeezing every bit of lusciousness out of it to just see as many dancers as I could.  And the bartender kind of knew, kind of remember, you know, looking and kind of laughing.  But I guess it wasn't that big a deal.  Nah, back then they let you.  Went in and watched some tits, got a boner, sit there and get my boner.  Getting your boner on.  At the tit bar.  God, that goes away after a while when you're so jaded and disgusted with tit bars and strippers. 
[00:14:00]  When you first go, especially as a kid, your first time in the tit bar, it's like, oh.  Danny's Den.  Naked girls.  Do you remember Danny's Den?  Of course.  Danny's Den was such a shithole, man.  I don't think there was a strip club on the island I hadn't been to.  This place was so bad they decided to knock it down just to make parking for the supermarket.  Yeah, that bad.  That's how valuable this little house was that was a strip club.  Yeah, there were all these, like, pieces of shit, like old houses. 
[00:14:30]  Right.  There weren't even a building in a strip mall or something.  Or a stand-alone building for, like, a store.  It was a house.  Like, they would decorate up this house on the outside, paint the windows black,  put a sign, Exotic West Coast Dancers on the outside.  I remember that.  What the hell is that?  West Coast, they're from Bayshore.  Exotic West Coast Dancers, yeah.  From Bayshore.  Trust me.  Someone in Kansas is like, Bayshore, trust me.  Just think. 
[00:15:00]  You have a Bayshore near you.  Yeah, just think of the, ugh, town in your neighborhood.  The white trash town near you.  Sorry, Bayshore.  You're it.  You're it.  We refer to Bayshore a lot on this show.  Yeah.  But I remember we were in there, Danny's Den, 18, and the first girl that came out, I swear  to God, she had a cesarean scar and some kind of bullet wound.  Bullet wound.  That's all we can, that's the only thing we can figure out it was.  That's great.  And she's dancing to the animal's house of the rising sun. 
[00:15:30]  Yeah.  There is a house in New Orleans.  With her C-section scar.  Nothing better than a gut shot scar that had to be probed for the bullet so they cut up  like a dissection.  Right.  And there she is dancing.  It looks like she took the tip of a, yeah, a knife and tried to pull it out herself.  Yeah, she's gouged it out.  Gouged it out.  That's wonderful.  Because she doesn't want the cops involved.  Jesus, what the hell is going on?  Her biker boyfriend shot her. 
[00:16:00]  Yeah, fun.  Ah, good times.  Good times.  Good times.  Good times.  So, speaking of Bush, the president, he's on the front page of all the New York papers,  and I'm sure he's on the front page of your paper.  So hard to defend this guy.  You know, I like thinking I'm open-minded, and I look at both sides of things, so I don't  see everything.  There are a lot of Democrats, liberal Democrats especially, that just bash anything Bush does,  which isn't right.  And then there are the hardcore conservative Republicans that look at him like he can do 
[00:16:30]  no wrong.  The truth of the matter is, the truth lies somewhere in the middle, and sometimes it  goes a little closer to he's a moron that can't do anything right, and sometimes it goes  toward what a genius he's doing very well.  But last night, he's watching the speech in the shitter, and he comes out and does this  speech, and it was presented to the public like this was going to be a speech that outlined  what the future plans for Iraq were, what we're going to do there. 
[00:17:00]  Obviously not a timetable for troop withdrawal, but just some type of plan that's going on.  Inform the people what's going on.  Nothing new here.  There was not a word out of his mouth that had anything new.  And it was insulting, and I agree with the Democrats that came out, the pundits that came out afterwards  and said that him bringing up 9-11 five times in a 28-minute speech was ridiculous, it was insulting, 
[00:17:30]  and it shouldn't have been done.  The fact that he's still linking 9-11 with the war in Iraq is ridiculous, and he really,  it comes off as insulting to the people.  I don't think he did a good job last night with this speech, is what I'm getting at.  He was stumbling all over the place, too.  Oh, well, he always does.  I know, he's just a horrible public speaker.  He's bad.  Sometimes he can get a good word out or a phrase, but for the most part, he's just a stuttering, 
[00:18:00]  muttering prick.  You know who's a good speaker?  Martin Luther King Jr.  Ah, there you go.  I have a dream.  So his approval rating is like, what, like 40% of the people agree with what we're doing  in Iraq or something like that at this point?  Is it 40?  Something like that.  Man, you get gas prices down to a dollar, and everyone will approve.  Yeah, what happened?  Man, wasn't this the war for oil?  I heard every liberal Democrat was like, chiming in, he's just doing this for the oil man. 
[00:18:30]  It's the oil man.  War no blood for oil.  Bring our troops home.  It's the oil man.  Highest prices ever, ever, ever.  Ever.  You would think they would be the lowest prices ever.  Lowest prices.  We're pushing $3 in some places, right?  We should be showering in this stuff.  La, la, la, dee da.  But no, highest prices ever.  Great time to own a gigantic SUV, people. 
[00:19:00]  Let me tell you, I fill that goddamn thing up.  Holy shit.  I know.  Cha-ching.  My SUV, because we are ugly Americans.  Yes.  We don't have our big SUVs.  Must have your big vehicle.  Mine's not even that big, and it's cost me $45 to fill up.  $45?  Yeah, pretty much.  That's nice.  That's a quaint little price for gas.  $45.  Can you imagine?  I'm well into the 60s when I fill up.  Yeah.  When it's on empty?  Ooh.  I was on ridiculous empty yesterday, where the light comes on and the car starts yelling 
[00:19:30]  at you.  What are you, an idiot?  Mm-hmm.  What do you think?  That would be fun.  What do you think?  I run on fumes, asshole?  Gas up.  Look at the nav system.  You're in Manhattan.  You'll never find a gas station.  You're going to run out.  You know what element is in this town when you run out of gas.  It's horrible.  God, there's a market for that.  Mm.  You know, just your car talking to you.  Just yelling at you.  Rudely?  That would be hilarious.  Instead of just hearing that little ding, ding, ding.  Oh, oh, oh. 
[00:20:00]  What is that?  Oh.  Yeah, you can have little settings.  Like, if you don't want to be offended, it could be just your common courtesy, let you  know.  But if you want, you know, some real discussion, conversation, you could program in, you know,  authentic, friend-like conversation with your car.  Where it's like, hey, asshole, gas.  I want a hot female.  Yeah?  Basically saying, you know, she needs something stuck in her because your car is running out  of fuel.  Pull up to the pump.  Stick the nozzle in my hole.  Pump. 
[00:20:30]  Oh.  You got your door open.  Your car is moaning at the gas station.  We'd be stopping at gas stations every two miles.  What the hell are you doing, man?  You're on, you're on, you're full.  I think I could squeeze another half a gallon in this thing.  I think my navigation system sounds cute.  Yeah?  Yeah, she's a, it's a girl's voice.  You know, she's a fat hog.  Probably.  Oh, great.  Just ruined it for me.  You pop in the nav, you're driving down the highway, and she tells you, you know, get 
[00:21:00]  off at a certain exit.  And she got a nice, really, like, a cute voice for a girl voice on the nav system.  It's much better than a guy voice telling you what to do.  Be like, fuck you.  I'm not going to listen to you.  You're a guy voice.  I got an idea for today's show.  Ha.  Fat pigs with hot voices.  Oh, yeah.  They're just going to be calling like crazy.  Fat pigs with hot voices on the Opie and Anthony program this morning.  You're never going to listen to you. 
[00:21:30]  You're insane.  We already have a feature like that.  It's called Every Woman That Calls In Here.  Maybe, uh, maybe I should have sold it differently, huh?  If you're pleasantly plump and have a hot voice.  Pleasantly plump.  Now, how can we sell this where the girls would actually call in?  I don't know.  Not pigs with hot voices.  Ah, they're not going to call it.  That doesn't help.  How about, um, what's the word they use in, like, uh, in fashion?  Plus size? 
[00:22:00]  BBW.  If you're a BBW with a great voice.  With a great voice.  Call the program.  They all think they're BBWs.  BBW.  I'm a big dude.  You're not.  If you're a chubby mess.  Chubby.  I'm just chubby.  Just change your voice and, not change your voice, change your name and call up with your  sexiest.  No one's going to see you.  If you're the type of girl that's had a lot of phone sex, and then when your date comes  to pick you up, he always just looks and then drives away quickly.  Please pick up the phone and call in. 
[00:22:30]  All right, Anthony, 60-some-odd dollars to fill up?  Yeah.  I know this guy's a trucker, but listen to this.  Kevin, go ahead.  Oh, yeah.  You were talking about the president, and nothing good has come for me since he took office.  I'm an owner-operator.  I get, like, seven miles a gallon out of my truck.  I'm paying now $1,500 a week to operate my truck, and it's just cut into my profit margin.  Can you imagine?  $1,500 a week.  $1,500 a week for fuel. 
[00:23:00]  Holy killer.  Do you ever pay cash?  I would pay cash.  I would pay cash in dollar bills.  There you go.  Thank you, my friend.  Thank you, my friend.  My friend.  Where's the cheap gas?  We need to do that, but everything's paid electronically today.  You don't care about cash.  No.  You see, you never think about the truckers and how much they're spending at the pumps  at one given moment.  $1,500.  Well, our economy reflects it.  All right.  And sooner or later, we're all going to pay through the nose.  That's the thing about fuel prices. 
[00:23:30]  It makes everything go up.  The price, everything goes up because fuel prices are high.  It's the one thing that's just tied into every single product that you buy.  Well, if the cost of transferring it's going to be more expensive, they're going to hit us  in our pocketbooks.  In our pocketbook.  I know, the girls at the titty bar are suffering because I don't have the cash to lay out like  I used to.  Some of that $1,500 I got just since.  Some of that $1,500 would have ended up in small bills in very stinky places. 
[00:24:00]  You got that right.  All right.  And by the way, I got wowed yesterday, even though it wasn't Wednesday.  So thanks a lot for that.  Well, basically, yeah, we like to acknowledge Whip Them Out Wednesday, but if you have that  wow in your car, it could happen at any moment.  I put duct tape on the back of my trailer.  All us truckers carry duct tape, so I put W-O-W on the back of the trailer, and the women  know what it means.  Of course they do.  And if you want your official wow sticker, just send a self-addressed stamped envelope 
[00:24:30]  into us here in New York City, and we'll send out the wow sticker.  Okay, I've got to get your address because I have something interesting.  I'm from St. Louis, and we have a newspaper called The Evening Whirl, and the vernacular  is just the way black people speak, and I want you guys to read this sometime.  I've got to get you a copy.  All right.  I'll mail it to you.  All right.  It's 111, I think, West 57th Street, Suite 500, New York, New York, 10019. 
[00:25:00]  Got it.  How old an issue is that, sir?  Is it a newer issue, or is it a bit older?  I'm sorry?  How old of an issue is that issue that you're going to send us?  I'll get the freshest issue I can get my hands on next time I'm in New York City.  All right.  We'll check it out.  You can also use that address to send in your self-addressed stamped envelopes for the wow  stickers.  Thanks, bro.  Okay.  Thank you.  Bye.  All right.  This guy, Bill.  Watch it out.  Bill from Wack Bag.  I would ride my bike to the Tender Trap at the same time as Anthony, like 16 years old, 
[00:25:30]  using a handwritten ID from the Dix Hills Park golf course.  I'd leave my bike behind the auto shop next door to the Trap.  Yeah.  That place really didn't care, did it?  No.  Let's go to John in Queens.  John, what's up?  Boys, good morning.  Hey there, Jenny.  Listen.  Yes.  The speech that Bush gave last night.  Yeah.  I've got to take a little issue with you, Anthony.  All right.  It's an exchange of ideas here, sir. 
[00:26:00]  There we go.  Listen, brother.  Yes.  The things that he was detailing, what you've got to realize is exactly what he started  saying in the beginning.  So you're looking for new ideas.  You don't want new ideas when you've got 300,000 troops out there in the field.  You want to send a message to the guys that say, hey, listen, we're still doing the same  thing.  We've been on track the whole time, and let's keep going.  That's the first thing.  Yeah, but it was presented to the American people as this new thing, like, to promo it 
[00:26:30]  almost, so people will tune in.  It was presented that there will be some type of plan, which people here plan, they think  some kind of a view to the end of the tunnel here, a light at the end of the tunnel, something.  But there was nothing new here.  Well, here's the thing, though.  I mean, and listen to this.  I live here, right?  And I was here on September 11th, okay?  And you made a comment a week or so ago, I don't know if it was you or Opie, you were  talking about how, like, two or three days after the fact, people were hanging out in 
[00:27:00]  bars.  Well, that type of mentality is prevalent throughout all of America.  So if people that live here, three days after the event, can go on with their life like nothing  happened, then just imagine what it's like for somebody on the West Coast where it didn't  happen.  Yeah, but, dude, him bringing up September 11th, it really, you know, come on.  Let's open our eyes here.  It really doesn't have much to do with the war in Iraq.  It really doesn't. 
[00:27:30]  He's comparing the insurgents with the terrorists that brought down the buildings.  I mean, you know, it's a reach.  It really is.  I think the money, whatever reason we're in Iraq, you could justify it by saying, yeah,  we want democracy there because it would stabilize the area.  That's fine.  Okay, that's a valid point.  To say that we're there to stop the terrorists that attacked us, that's ridiculous.  That money could have been well spent on intelligence and really weeding out true terrorists and 
[00:28:00]  plots against us that take years and years to develop that we could then find out that  they're developing them before they hit us.  With billions of dollars in intelligence, that would have happened.  But no, we're over there in Iraq.  Well, listen, the panic that America would experience, okay, and the panic that the financial  system would experience would be overwhelming.  If we really probably knew the truth, okay, if we knew how dangerous it was, it would probably  be a bad place to live and a lot of people would freak out. 
[00:28:30]  So, I think, not unlike, I don't know if you were here during the 90s when Rudy took office.  Of course I was.  Rudy didn't, you know, didn't honestly just say, okay, I'm going to clean up the city.  He said, I'm going to clean up that corner.  I'm going to start on that corner and I'm not going to allow any drug dealers or pimps or  any graffiti on this corner.  And then people moved to the next corner.  And it was that type of strange, outlandish, offhanded way that he approached crime in 
[00:29:00]  the city.  And it had a dramatic effect.  And it's funny, I talked to a friend of mine who was 16.  When he was 16, he used to do graffiti all over the bridges and tunnels.  The city used to be fun, Opie.  Scary place to go.  But, dude, Ant kind of did say that, like, if he was saying that it was to clean up the  Middle East, like, so you have to fix Iraq so it's a better place, that would kind of  go hand in hand with what you're saying.  Right.  Just be honest with us and go and say, the reason we're in Iraq is to stabilize the area. 
[00:29:30]  If you get a democracy, a foothold in there, it'll be a much more stable area.  It'll take years and years and years to do it.  It's going to be a hard fight.  But that is our goal here.  And it's not that.  It's let's scare America.  Let's frighten them thinking that if we're not in Iraq, that more buildings are coming  down and more people are dying in our American cities.  That's the shit I'm not buying.  I'm not eating the line of bullshit.  And a lot of other Americans aren't either. 
[00:30:00]  And I just think they need to be a little more honest with us.  Well, I think they are being honest.  But I think that you've got to understand the bigger picture.  As far as defending homeland security, the money, the billions and billions of dollars  being spent in Iraq could better be spent protecting the country, which would be through  intelligence.  Listen, if we had a better CIA back in the 90s, 9-11 wouldn't have happened.  The attacks on 9-11 would not have happened.  We have more spending and more tech.  Oh, that wasn't us. 
[00:30:30]  Sorry.  That was not us.  He went away.  Maybe he was shot.  We got...  Somebody shot him.  A terrorist got him.  A bunch of people are bitching and complaining on the instant feedback going, you know, stop  bitching about gas prices.  Because, you know, gas is a lot more expensive around the world, obviously.  We all know that.  I actually did not know that.  I have no idea.  Get that pop culture quiz for Jimmy.  Why?  I didn't know gas...  You really had no idea that gas is ridiculous everywhere else except America?  No.  I just know that I don't even look at the gas prices because I hardly ever have to fill 
[00:31:00]  up because I live in Manhattan.  Yeah.  I'm going to drive a low car.  It might be like an extra eight bucks or whatever, but I'm so infrequently have to fill  up.  I don't care.  Oh, no.  The hardcore liberals love to point this out all the time.  Let's all relax as Americans.  You know, gas is a lot more expensive around the world.  And we got some examples here.  Ooh.  Where's some examples?  I don't have any examples, Eric.  Where's my examples?  Why doesn't Jimmy get the examples?  Where are my examples?  Give Jimmy examples.  I would like a page of examples.  What are we paying for gas right now? 
[00:31:30]  What are we paying for gas right now?  I wouldn't know.  I don't have any examples in front of me.  In this city, upwards of 280.  All right.  So under three, right?  Yeah.  All right.  So Tokyo.  Tokyo.  Tokyo's stupid.  Tokyo, Japan.  384 a gallon.  Where do you have Tokyo?  I don't have Tokyo on my examples.  You don't go all the way to the top.  Thanks.  But you didn't start at the bottom.  No, I'm just saying, I'm just showing people where we're at.  We're paying upwards of 280 a gallon. 
[00:32:00]  Oh, there's Tokyo.  Tokyo, Japan.  Oh, but you started in the middle of your examples.  That's right.  That's what I do.  I did it a little differently.  So they're paying 384 a gallon, more or less, okay?  Some other examples of gas prices that are higher than us.  Geneva, Switzerland, Anthony.  456 a gallon.  Korea, Seoul, Korea, 471.  Rome, Italy.  There you go.  486 a gallon, Anthony. 
[00:32:30]  Mamma mia!  Germany.  Frankfurt.  529 a gallon.  Achso lieber!  Unless you're stealing from a Jew, then it's free.  Awful Germans.  A couple other notables on this list.  Ah, Copenhagen.  Denmark.  5.08 a gallon.  Venezuela.  That's the best.  Well, we're going to get to Venezuela, because I don't understand that one, actually.  Dude, it's coming out of the mountains. 
[00:33:00]  Okay.  It's coming out of the ground over there in Venezuela.  And then, basically, a bunch of cities in the U.K., upwards of 5.64 a gallon, they're  paying.  5.64 a gallon.  So then you go down.  These are the countries that are paying a lot less for gas than the United States, okay?  Sydney, Australia.  All lovely places, by the way.  I know.  All garden spots of the world.  Sydney, Australia is, you know, just below us at 2.63 a gallon, more or less.  And the rest of these countries I've never heard of. 
[00:33:30]  Well, there's a couple I have, but, like, Thailand is $1.60 a gallon.  Shanghai, China, $1.48.  Moscow, Russia, $1.45.  We're cheaper gas prices than you.  We're so much better.  Look at our gas price.  Cheap.  You pay so much.  Taiwan, $2.47 a gallon.  And then you get down to these countries, like, uh, uh... 
[00:34:00]  Kazakhstan.  Yes.  $1.36 a gallon.  Mm-hmm.  Uh, and then this country, uh, the third from the bottom?  Uh, Tajikistan?  Tajikistan.  Yeah, exactly.  Tajikistan.  $1.32 a gallon they're paying.  Ooh.  And then this country right here.  Uh, Azerbaijan.  Uh, Azerbaijan.  Uh, Azerbaijan.  Uh, Azerbaijan.  Uh, this country's called ass. 
[00:34:30]  Azerbaijan.  Azerbaijan.  Azerbaijan.  Azerbaijan.  Azerbaijan.  Azerbaijan.  What is it there, Steve?  What is it, Steve, with your diction?  Azerbaijan.  Of course.  Azerbaijan.  Oh, excuse me.  You make Alex Trebek sound like a stroke victim.  They're playing, uh, they're...  What is Azerbaijan?  They're paying $1.15 a gallon.  Nice.  And the winner...  Caracas.  Venezuela.  $0.14 a gallon? 
[00:35:00]  $0.14.  They have cars over there, or are they still using yaks?  Maybe that's why it's so cheap.  No one uses it.  No one uses it.  Not much demand.  The yak drinks it, it dies.  $0.14 a gallon.  How many gallons if you're driving one of those mopeds?  Oh, wow.  One?  Miles per gallon?  No, just like, how much gas can a moped...  Oh, probably, uh, five.  You think five gallons?  Not even, right?  Not even?  Well, because you've got to mix it with two-stroke oil, so... 
[00:35:30]  Yeah.  Do you?  Yeah.  Why?  Can you imagine you fill up your moped for, like, $0.50, and then drive around for, like,  a month?  Yeah, drive around.  With that, it would be nothing.  It would be $0.14.  But you're forgetting to say that the monthly wage is $1.08.  True.  All right, well...  Put your little kids to work sewing clothes for us here in America.  Yes, sir.  Becoming young prostitutes in Thailand and some of these fine countries.  Of course.  And, of course, once again, Canada calling the program going, what about us?  What about us?  Well, they have higher taxes because of their medical law. 
[00:36:00]  Let's go to Rich in Canada.  Go ahead, Rich.  Their medical law.  Hi.  Hi, Rich.  Oh, it's Mitch.  Sorry.  It's Mitch from Montreal.  Hey.  How you doing?  Not too bad, guys.  How you doing?  Hey, good, good.  How's the weather there, eh?  How's the weather there, eh?  Yeah.  It's hot as hell.  Yeah.  Hot.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What do you got for us, Rich, eh? 
[00:36:30]  Well, I just wanted to say three things, if that's not too much.  No, that's fine.  Go ahead.  That's fine.  Okay.  We're paying here in Montreal.  We're paying $4.08 a gallon, and we're right by, we're like 45 miles from the border.  Is that for American?  It's Canadian.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Fuck, American.  Stop it.  You're stupid Canadian money.  What, do you give him four loonies for every gallon, you stupid money with your loonies?  He's laughing at his own money.  I get my Canadian money mixed up with my Monopoly money all the time. 
[00:37:00]  Who's that whore on your money?  It's my mother.  It's my mother.  Sorry.  That's the queen.  Ah, ah, yeah.  The queen, you know, eh?  Ah.  Eh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I love Canada.  What else, Mitch?  You guys rule.  Well, the second thing I wanted to say was, Canada didn't back Bush in the war, which was disgraceful.  I was disgraced of my country.  I found it a disgrace that they didn't, because they're neighbors and they should have.  Howdy, neighbor.  Yeah, but in the long run, it turned out that there weren't weapons of mass destruction, but no one knew that. 
[00:37:30]  So at the time, Canada should have backed them.  But of course, like, I agree with Anthony that the government should have been more straight with the people and told them what the main issue of the invasion was, not that it was, you know, they were using it as a scare tactic.  And if you read the Tony Blair report, you would see the biggest scare tactic.  If you go on the net, you'll see that they were saying, like, thousands of tons of anthrax and all kinds of crazy neural agents. 
[00:38:00]  And I read that report, and I said, you know, Canada, you're a bunch of idiots.  You should go with the Americans, of course, because we should support each other.  And then after, I felt like a total fool.  You know, you'd think at least they would have maybe planted something in the country or something.  Plant something.  There wasn't even a jar of anthrax, you know what I mean?  I know.  I was in the same boat. 
[00:38:30]  I mean, when I first heard and I saw Colin Powell go before the United Nations and pull out the charts and the pictures and everything, I was the cheerleader, man.  I was like, come on, we've got to get in there.  Look what these guys got.  But you realize it was, you know, a lot of it was just bullshit.  It wasn't bad intelligence.  It was really trying too hard to make a case to go to war.  And, you know, now we're dealing with it.  I'm not saying pull out.  I'm not the pull out and leave the place to anarchy kind of guy. 
[00:39:00]  We were in there.  Now we've got to finish the job.  It's just the way it is.  But don't try to bullshit me.  And a lot of these hardline conservative Republicans, they don't see.  Are they blind or stupid?  I mean, look, you were bullshitted too.  Be honest.  You were bullshitted too.  Every president does it.  Don't worry.  It's not going to make you look stupid.  It happens.  I was bullshitted.  I was bullshitted.  I'm willing to admit it.  I fell for it. 
[00:39:30]  I wanted to go to war because I saw the intelligence and everything.  But we were bullshitted too.  The purpose to go to war was false as far as Bush's reasoning went.  But now we're there and we've got to finish.  Yeah.  You know how many Canadians and friends I've had fights with?  I mean real.  I got really mad in fights.  And I was red.  Like, I was so mad that people weren't backing this.  And now I look like the biggest ass. 
[00:40:00]  Yeah.  Well, this discussion just goes on forever.  And there's two sides to it.  And you'll never convince the other side.  And it's one of the most heated debates that have been going on for a couple of years now.  And they are finding mass graves, which I could care less about the Iraqi people.  Oh, I could absolutely care less if Saddam was killing all of them.  Who cares?  But they are finding, I mean, look, you've got to say, it's not like all of a sudden they're uncovering gardens.  I mean, the guy really was a barbarian.  Oh, he was.  So that does kind of, even though the reasoning was wrong, it does kind of strengthen Bush's case slightly, even though the reasoning was not honest. 
[00:40:30]  But it was Saddam's country.  His people put him in power.  And they were dealing with the consequences.  Well, the one thing the left doesn't deal with it well is when you say that, they go, yeah, well, how many dictators are there?  It's like, well, that's irrelevant.  This is one situation.  And, yeah, you know, he was at least a murdering fucking thug.  He wasn't like a nice guy.  Like, even in Iran, where they're an awful government that we don't like, they're not murdering their own people and putting them in mass graves. 
[00:41:00]  What about Africa?  We don't do shit there.  The second we go there, we talk about Iraq with the sacrifices that have been made and it's worth it and we're sorry about the bloodshed.  The second any blood is shed in Africa, you see all of Europe and the United States just pull the fuck out.  And it's their own people killing each other.  Well, that was Clinton kind of pulled out of it.  Yeah, but you don't see anybody really crying about it or clamoring to get back in there and finish the job.  I want to get over there and take care of things.  I mean, I think we had a good thing going in Johannesburg and all of a sudden everybody gets crazy. 
[00:41:30]  Everyone goes nuts.  Let's go to Tony in Brooklyn.  Tony!  Hey, it's a mongrel race up there in Canada.  Do we really care if those Canadian dudley do-right motherfuckers want to help us out or whatever?  By the way, we're doomed as a world.  We're doomed as a planet.  I had a great thing going, but then Mitch hung up because he thought we were done with him.  I wanted Mitch from Canada to talk to Tony from Brooklyn.  Yeah.  These people, they're all so well-informed and yet they have no stake in it. 
[00:42:00]  They sit up there in a socialized medicine world and cast downward looks at the United States.  Hey, they got good health care.  All Canadians.  They got great health care up there in Canada.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Come on, health reporter.  Punch it out.  We just make people pay like, you know, 15 bucks for a pack of cigarettes.  Eh?  And then that goes to health care, eh?  Eh?  Yeah.  Steve has a hybrid car he wants to talk about.  Oh, Steve!  I was just going to mention, the quick way to alleviate all this gas headache is having 
[00:42:30]  a hybrid.  Do you have a hybrid, Steve?  I do.  It's the antithesis completely of your SUV.  What did you have before the hybrid?  I had a GMC envoy.  He had an envoy beforehand.  Bailed out at the right moment.  Steve just wants to move to Hollywood.  He just wants to be part of that whole group of people driving around.  Ramon, pull around the hybrid.  Ramon, plug in my car.  Steve just wants to be driving around in his hybrid in Los Angeles. 
[00:43:00]  Hybrid.  Drinking his wheatgrass with his pals.  You have a car that runs on gas, but also has a generator and batteries.  An electric fuel cell.  You don't have to plug it in, Jimmy.  An electric fuel cell, which is recharged by the engine and the brakes.  Correct.  Also recharge your car.  Absolutely.  It uses resistance, magnetic resistance in the wheels that actually slow your car down  and recharges your battery at the same time.  It's funny. 
[00:43:30]  I was just thinking that.  How do you know that, Ant?  Popular mechanics.  Forget Aristotle and fuck Socrates.  Here comes Professor Anthony.  Wonderful technology.  Jimmy and I were walking home yesterday after the show, and we were just thinking about  exactly what you just did.  That's what dummies we are.  We're like, God, do you feel really stupid when Anthony goes off and just talks about  something in a way that we all should know?  It's worthless knowledge that I know. 
[00:44:00]  It's worthless.  Here's what happens for those of you not in the studio.  When Anthony starts with something like that, Opie will kind of just look over at the  CD thing, because apparently there's something to be potted up.  When I glance down at the newspaper, like, I'm not just hearing that there's a smarter  person talking.  Then Jimmy and I will glance at each other, like, okay, I'm not the only one.  All right, good.  How can I sound like I'm agreeing with him, like I know what he's talking about?  Dude, no, it's funny.  Right, right, right, right, yes.  Damn it.  I didn't get to that issue of popular mechanics yet.  Good one.  That's a great magazine for reading on the ball. 
[00:44:30]  Nice short little articles on everything, from iPods to building a shed in the backyard.  He did everything.  So you're saying...  Jay Leno's column, by the way, very funny and very good.  Jay Leno does a column every month in Popular Mechanics about cars, classic cars and redoing  cars.  Buys like a 1945 fire engine and puts like a big block engine in it and makes it a hot  rod and then writes about it.  He's like a real car friend.  He is a nut with cars.  Him and Seinfeld, they both have like huge garages on their estates that are just loaded 
[00:45:00]  with cars.  But Seinfeld has one here in New York, actually.  He had a garage built in a building or something.  It caused a lot of ruckus.  He pretty much took over a whole building to make it into a garage for his cars or something.  Porsches.  Porsche.  He loves the Porsche.  I say, you know, he's at the comedy show.  You walk up sometimes, you see a nice...  If you see like an SUV, you know, Chappelle is going on it.  If you see a big...  A little Porsche, it's usually Seinfeld.  Yeah.  I don't think I'm giving away any trade secrets.  Broken down, stinking Rolls Royce.  You know, Vos. 
[00:45:30]  Smoking, nervous man.  And if you see a Saturn with a black person with a blonde wig, guess who's that?  So you're saying that this is like a combination?  Because they're trying to mix electricity with regular cars, and you're going to get a conglomerated  mulata, mongrel class of vehicle.  Now that you put it that way, I don't feel so good about it anymore.  Yeah, the people that have the plug-in cars were...  Oh, that's a little much back in the old days. 
[00:46:00]  And ask them if they want to help save this country from the onslaught of integration.  You know, the system is they want to throw white children and colored children into the  building part of integration, throughout of which will come a conglomerated mulata,  mongrel class of people.  All the braces will be destroyed in such a way.  I, for one, after God will die before I'll yield one inch. 
[00:46:30]  And that's kind of a moment.  Wow.  The way he builds up to that mongrel, he just, it explodes out of him.  It just can't stay in anymore.  The idea of it alone just makes him so angry.  So we don't have to plug in the cars anymore?  No.  No, no, no.  But they're saying now, how much do you spend on gas a week, and how much less is it than  it was?  Every time I fill up my car from empty, it's about 18 bucks, and it goes for roughly 400  miles.  Wow.  Jesus.  That's pretty damn good. 
[00:47:00]  Yeah.  Because mine is about $65, and it gets me 360 miles.  Yeah.  It's great for city driving, because if your foot isn't on the accelerator, the car is  basically off.  It just, the engine shuts off, and you're coasting.  Yeah, the engine shuts off.  It's almost like a golf cart.  Yeah.  You know how golf carts, when you step on the gas, it goes, and it takes off, and then  you let off the gas, and it stops.  You don't hear the engine running.  Well, those golf carts are getting out of control.  They're taking over all the little neighborhoods now. 
[00:47:30]  Oh, yeah.  Especially down in, like, Florida and stuff.  The old people love their golf carts.  They trick them out, pick the ride.  I was in, like, Winter Park, Florida, about a month or so ago, just in the regular Main  Street downtown there, going to breakfast with my sister, and there's all nice shops there  in the Starbucks and what have you, and everyone just parking along, just in their regular cars,  and next thing you know, there's, like, a golf cart flying by you.  Yeah.  The souped-up golf carts.  Yeah, they love them down there. 
[00:48:00]  The hybrid car that Steve has beforehand, they would plug in the cars, and you would  hear all these environmentalists saying how great it is.  Who had one of those?  Ed Begley Jr.  Ed Begley Jr., the poster boy for...  I saw him when I was out in California on vacation once.  He's, it's an electric Taurus, at least it looks like, from the outside.  Yeah, and you plug it in.  Yeah, exactly.  Now, what people don't understand, when you plug something in, that power isn't coming  from nowhere.  Yeah.  It's coming from a power plant, which has to be powered. 
[00:48:30]  Generators have to be turned.  By?  By?  Fossil fuels.  Right.  Yeah.  Fossil fuels.  Right.  So, you're still using resources.  Yeah.  It's not like it's coming from nowhere.  No, no.  It's not a cure-all.  It's making pollution.  Sure.  Still.  Well, Jim wants in on the conversation.  Jim, go ahead.  Yeah, man.  Not only is the hybrid car, he's just junk.  Because Volkswagen's been getting 50 mile a gallon in their diesels since the late 70s. 
[00:49:00]  He's got the small car, but, you know, it's getting the job done.  He's paying a lot less for gas, though.  He's paying a lot less for gas in a diesel car.  He's paying less than people with diesels.  He's paying 18 bucks, and it's getting him 400 miles, dude.  Yeah, and, you know, and the Chino Metro, you know, they got 50 miles a gallon and quit  making them.  That was a stupid move.  The cars were all good.  Thank you, Jim.  All right.  Punch it out.  But the hit I took when I traded in my Envoy, I mean, I didn't have any scratches on it or 
[00:49:30]  anything, and it was a huge hit.  And the guy said, look, you can do it now, or you can wait six months, and I'll give you  $10,000 less for it.  No one's buying the SUVs.  They cannot sell SUVs.  And the biggest hit is people that buy Escalades.  Sorry, Anthony.  Well, you take, you know, like a brand new one.  You'll lose two-thirds of the car's value the second you drive it off a lot because they  can't resell them.  I know.  I'll pull up.  They'll give me $10 for it.  Okay. 
[00:50:00]  Great.  Wonderful.  Well, we'll get to the Bush Clubs a little later in the show.  That's an ongoing story today.  Before we go to break, you want to do the first round of the Jim Norton Pop Culture Quiz?  Jim Norton Pop Culture Quiz?  Where is that?  Well, I have gas examples.  Well, I don't have a pop quiz for Jim Norton.  I got them right here.  I want to look along.  All right.  We were amazed yesterday that Jim doesn't know much about pop culture.  I have nothing to do with this, by the way, Jimmy. 
[00:50:30]  Wow.  Who did this?  Nathaniel decided to take it upon himself.  Well, what's the date?  Shut up.  What's the date?  It's only...  It's not July 5th yet.  Yeah.  Shh.  It was sent in by...  It was sent in, yeah.  But Nathaniel sent it in.  Oh, because he sits at home now, what he does.  He sits at home and writes for the show.  And faxes these things into us.  Right, like Carson did for Letterman.  Because Nathaniel will start July 5th, I think.  But that was good of him to fax it in.  Right.  But guys, then who's...  I don't know.  It's a new intern that looks a lot like Nathaniel. 
[00:51:00]  Oh, a surfer.  It looks like him.  They've hired Frankenstein's retarded brother to just kind of stand in there with a backwards  hat.  Oh, jeez.  Jesus, that old gag.  Are we going to explain that someday?  Eventually.  July 6th.  Anyways.  By the way, can I say how starstruck I was yesterday?  In my own building.  I get off the elevator and Dr. Michiukaku was there.  Michiukaku?  Yes, he's a theoretical physicist that I've heard on the radio and I was very starstruck.  Wow.  That's all.  No clue.  I know. 
[00:51:30]  Are you kidding?  No.  He's going to be on a bell show all the time.  In the elevator?  Michiukaku.  He was there waiting for the elevator.  He lives in your building?  Yeah.  Who is he?  He's like a professor at NYU or something.  How do you know it was him?  I recognize him.  I've seen him on TV.  He's a genius.  He's a genius.  Wow.  Did you discuss the elevator?  I didn't know it was him.  I couldn't believe it was actually him.  It would be heavier if it's going up.  No one else would have cared that it was him.  But I'm like, is that Dr. Kaku?  And then I asked him.  Kaku.  I know.  What is he known for, though?  He's...  He has a little physicist shop down there in a sofa.  Yeah, like if you're walking by on the street, he'll just talk math. 
[00:52:00]  Yeah.  Blurts out numbers.  Now, he would...  Art Bell, he would be on Art Bell.  He would always talk about, like, alternate universes.  But he's like, no, he's not a quack.  He's a...  Art Bell's a lot of fun to listen to.  He can be, yeah.  When he's not having shadow people discussions.  He's going to spit in his face.  Shut up, Art.  Shadow people.  Yeah, shadow people.  Well, the shadow...  Exactly.  They don't...  They're nothing.  All his discussions are about aliens and conspiracies and all kinds of wacky things.  Some of them are good, though.  When they have airline pilots, they play the audio of a pilot's transmission, like, or 
[00:52:30]  radar transmissions of things that are really weird that are actual audio.  That's kind of interesting.  But when I have somebody calling, I'm like, I saw some shadow people, and Art Bell has  to act with the shadow people of real.  Shadow people.  And not just hang up.  I see some, too.  Way uptown.  You go above Central Park here in the city.  This neighborhood's loaded with shadow people.  Shadow people tend to live in clusters.  Yeah.  What's the concept behind shadow people?  Dude, I get so annoyed when I hear about them.  You just tune out.  These are like people who live in the shadows, or they're like the shadows of people. 
[00:53:00]  They're just awful.  Shadow people.  Are they aliens or ghosts?  I don't know.  Sometimes he just entertains these morons.  And other times, he's got these geniuses on, like Richard Hoagland, and who I'm starting  to annoy me when there's a Mars theory.  We get it.  You think there's something there?  We know.  We know.  There's definitely something there.  I don't know.  You think?  I think there was.  Just a mountain.  I think there was at some point.  I saw it.  I don't think anymore, though.  It looks like a face. 
[00:53:30]  It looks like a face.  The face on Mars?  I love the face on Mars.  They show the face on Mars photograph from various other angles besides that famous one,  and it looks nothing like a face.  It's just the way that the shadows were on that certain time when the picture was taken.  Some other place is talking about the breast on Earth, and it's Mount Everest.  Idiots we are.  There's a tit on that planet.  Carved by people.  By Thetans.  Giant monument carved into a mountain.  I think there was something there, though. 
[00:54:00]  Can you print up the shadow people thing?  Oh, you got a shadow people theory?  Yeah.  Nice.  We'll print that up.  So Nathaniel came up with a pop culture quiz for Jim Norton.  This is pretty good because it's not that difficult.  I'm looking here, and the questions aren't that difficult.  They're pretty much things that anybody who spends just an average amount of time watching television,  or reading a little bit of an entertainment section,  or something should absolutely know these answers. 
[00:54:30]  Can you try to answer these?  I will try.  All right, good.  And I will succeed.  It just may not be correct.  Give me those ribs.  Ah, come on.  Wait, Dan knows what shadow people are.  Dan, go ahead.  Hey, uh, them shadow people are silhouettes of people from parallel universes.  Oh.  Oh, yeah?  I've never seen one of these shadow people. 
[00:55:00]  I've never seen one either, but that's what they always say on our bell.  Anyway, punch them out, guys.  All right, thanks, Dan.  People from alternate dimensions who are somehow bleeding into our dimension.  That's what Matt C. is saying.  Hmm.  Interesting.  Uh-huh.  Is there other dimensions out there?  The shadow people.  Well, Dr. Kaku would say yes.  I've heard him break it down into planetary levels,  and what makes you an advanced planet for alien species, yeah.  I don't buy the alternate dimension thing.  This guy is that smart, buddy.  I bet you he still goes to Starbucks and gets his latte. 
[00:55:30]  Whatever he does.  Yeah, I'll have a grande.  Because, you know, living in New York, you get to see some of these really famous people,  and you go, oh, look, he does the same shit we do.  Puts his pants on one leg at a time.  That's right.  Yeah, but he reads different things while sipping his latte.  Yeah.  You know, I'm looking at Craigslist, and, you know, he's reading Stephen Hawking stuff  and laughing at how incorrect it is.  This guy is beyond brilliant, but still has to wait for a cab when it's raining out. 
[00:56:00]  There it is.  Damn it.  Get all mad.  Doesn't get the special treatment, even though he knows about other dimensions.  Probably figuring out what the odds are that he'll get a cab in what amount of time.  He theorizes about other dimensions.  He gets that tummy ache from eating that spicy food, just like you and I.  Sits on the bowl and makes a mess.  That's a good point.  He gets an ass burn.  That's true.  And he wipes and looks at it and, like, looks at the butterscotch color and goes, uh-oh, flu coming.  Oh, my God.  That is so gross.  Butterscotch. 
[00:56:30]  That's true.  If your shit looks like it would be delicious on ice cream, you have a cold.  That's disgusting, man.  I'm a much happier person, though, because I went to the supermarket yesterday and got my new supply of baby wipes.  Ah, yes, yes.  I'm always happy when those come.  Oh, they don't call them baby wipes anymore, because we're all on to them.  Why do you go to the supermarket for that?  I don't know.  I was buying other shit.  Dude, drugstore.com. 
[00:57:00]  Oh, you're not leaving your house at this point?  Never leave the house.  Why leave the house when a box full of any toiletries or anything you need gets delivered right to your door?  Dude, you're getting weird, man.  Did you see that ant has outside of his house, like, the president has, like, those little plastic things set up from where the car is going to pull up to the actual front door so you can't see him?  He has one of those.  I just pull in.  Actually, I pull right into my garage, and the door closes.  You don't leave your house, do you? 
[00:57:30]  You rarely leave your house.  Very rarely.  Why?  And now you go to drugstore.com?  You go to drugstore.com.  They deliver everything.  I like to walk around a little bit.  I go to the drugstore.  I go to the supermarket.  I go to Starbucks and talk to the geniuses.  I'm going to Atlantic City this weekend.  All right.  I'll be in a casino in a hotel room.  Yeah.  All connected the whole weekend.  Fourth of July weekend.  Yeah, that makes sense.  I'll be inside for four days.  That's great.  Drugstore.com.  Yeah, you just go there.  You order everything you want. 
[00:58:00]  Sounds like a commercial, doesn't it?  You order what you want, and they deliver it.  It comes out of your credit card.  And you know what it is?  Because to go to the drugstore and pick everything up, you're always forgetting stuff.  You just, and you have to run out before you remember to get it.  It's like that kind of stuff.  Yeah, that's such a hassle.  Well, you just order it.  You can sit down and really think about it, and you type out what you need.  So you go to the drugstore, you feel part of society here.  Society blows. 
[00:58:30]  Do you go to the supermarket?  Occasionally, yeah.  They haven't figured that one out yet.  That one they have.  Freshdirect.com.  Yeah?  Don't tell them that.  But is it like everything you kind of want.  Allegedly, it's the freshest food, too.  Freshdirect.com.  I just can't do it because I'm on a bootleg internet connection for another couple weeks.  I'm using the wireless.  I don't need credit card information.  But yeah, FreshDirect.com.  FreshDirect.  Yeah, you just list the stuff you want, and it shows up in your door.  You shot.  I'll look into that.  Oh, it's great.  When I pull in and out of my garage, actually out in the morning, it's like an airlock. 
[00:59:00]  I go into the garage, and I have to lock the door from the garage into my house.  And then I get in my vehicle, and I lock the doors of my vehicle.  Then I open the garage door so that if there's any criminal element, they can't then run into the garage,  get into my house, or get into my vehicle by the time I back out.  That's how I do it.  And when you pull in, you do it actually the reverse way. 
[00:59:30]  You're the same guy I met 11 years ago, huh?  That's me, Opie.  Okay.  I'm still here.  Hi, look.  Hi.  Hey, Wave.  No, you're a shadow person.  A shadow person of Anthony.  What happened?  All right, listen.  When we get back, we'll do Jim's pop culture quiz.  Yeah.  We'll play some of the Bush clips.  Hi, to turn it over.  Don't wait, because he's a cheater.  And this is only round one.  I don't like the fact there are different rounds. 
[01:00:00]  I'm going to do better than everybody thinks.  You think so?  No.  I don't either.  Study up.  Quick clock.  Get me entertainment tonight.  Oh, oh, just, oh.  Oh.  I would probably.  I'm going to beat you with your own tongue.  I'm going to pull it out and smack your head with it.  You know what it is?  I have a, I have a, easy for you to say.  Oh, litty.  I have a, no litty.  I have apple in my mouth.  Dude, it's radio.  I was just saying like you actually had it.  I know. 
[01:00:30]  Rich in New York, go ahead.  You called me out.  Makes me look like the idiot.  Right.  He works a litty without a lid.  I answer it and he goes, dude, I don't even have the lid.  I look like the ass.  Yeah, he was helping you out, Jimmy.  I'm sorry.  I'm a phony.  Phony?  Oh, he's got his phone.  Someone wants to know, Tom from West Virginia, how long before you're broadcasting from your  house and we have to do that old closed circuit TV thing that some DJs do.  When I was looking for a house recently, I was down in a basement and going, I bet an 
[01:01:00]  ISDN line and some monitors in here would really be nice.  We will head that way eventually.  Rich in New York, what's up?  Hey, what's going on?  Hey.  Just wanted to let Anthony know of another service called peapod.com.  It's P-E-A-P-O-D dot com and they're affiliated with Stop and Shop and you can pretty much  do every bit of your shopping 100% down to your meats and vegetables and all your good  stuff and you can tell them what time you want it delivered to you. 
[01:01:30]  Oh, yeah?  This way it doesn't inconvenience you any.  You don't have to actually see anybody.  From what I understand, they'll actually slip it through a little slot on your door so you  don't have to touch them either.  Yeah, because I don't want them seeing my jars of urine, Opie, that are all over my living  room.  I stack them up in numerical order.  I stack first 10 and then there's 9, 8, 7, all golden jars of urine that I have  all around my house.  And then you go to thedrugstore.com and get nothing but chocolate. 
[01:02:00]  Right.  Just like chocolate bars.  Chocolate bars.  Where are your fingernail clippings?  I save them too, yes.  Of course you do.  All right, when we get back, Jim's pop culture quiz, also some bush clips.  Did you see the answers when I flipped it over?  Yes.  You did?  Yes.  No, you didn't.  I saw all of them.  No, you didn't.  All right, good.  And all the shark thing that we started yesterday?  Oh, I know.  Could be the best hour of radio coming up.  I went home and I was stunned and amazed at some of the teasers with a breaking story 
[01:02:30]  here in New York and Queens.  We give our listeners homework assignments from time to time.  We did the old, the remixes we like to do, the jingles, the Ramon promos.  The latest assignment for America.  Assignment for America.  Is news teases.  Yeah.  Where your local news tries to scare the shit out of you about something really dumb.  Right.  You know, because the shark thing is going to go away, but then they'll have to find something  else to scare you about.  Got to keep you scared.  So that's what we're looking for from you guys from all over the country. 
[01:03:00]  Clips for your local news where they're teasing the shit out of you and scaring you and all  that bullshit.  We got a couple examples because they're already starting to come in.  Okay?  Roy.  All right.  Like sand through the hourglass, so is the O&A virus.  What can I honestly say?  Anybody rips me off.  When I hear the same exact bits done, that's how I say it.  I mean, what about wow?  That's totally their idea.  Oh, there you go.  Okay.  There's something new. 
[01:03:30]  Well, and then...  There's something new.  You know what?  I used to do that in Washington, D.C.  Tell them, Fred.  I used to have people tie bandanas around their cars so that women would take their  clothes off in the cars.  Dude, get rid of it.  All right.  Well, I mean...  Give me an original idea.  Come on.  I mean...  I know you...  I know I...  I used to have my listeners tie a bandana around their cars.  I mean, I've done it all.  What about going off on...  I totally know that's you.  All right.  Okay.  Whatever.  I got to go.  Please.  I don't really want to get into a discussion like this.  He's so delusional.  That is really funny. 
[01:04:00]  Someone found the clip.  Yeah, that's something we couldn't play on the old show because of the...  the gag order that he placed on us.  How do you tie a bandana around your car?  That's a great one.  That's a big bandana.  What's the matter?  My car has cancer.  People throwing Frisbees to their cars.  Jump and grab it.  God, just showing your age, man.  You can't even tie bandanas to antennas anymore.  It's all hippied out.  You honk the horn.  Beep, beep. 
[01:04:30]  Dude.  Oh, dude.  He's so delusional.  Oh, man.  Just admit it.  Wow is such an original idea.  I invented everything.  I've done it all.  He even said, I've done it all.  Wow.  Even the stuff that's going to be invented, I did it already.  There's no real idea.  I went into a time machine and I already did it.  He killed himself, Robin.  Right.  I've done it all.  Hoo-hoo-hoo.  I was the first one to do anything.  Crap.  Marconi ripped me off, Robin.  Remember the, what was that thing called?  Dot, dot, dash, dash, dot Morse code. 
[01:05:00]  It was Howard code earlier.  The guy ripped me off.  I invented SOS.  Hoo-hoo-hoo, Robin.  What a complete jackass.  He's the guy.  Wow.  Wow.  He invented wow.  And it had nothing to do with whip him out Wednesday.  Wow.  It was tying a bandana around your car.  Thank you, Howard.  And what were we supposed to do if you saw?  I don't know.  He didn't really explain it very well.  Of course he's not going to explain.  If someone had a bandana tied around their car somehow, girls would get naked in the car? 
[01:05:30]  It wasn't even flat.  Girls would get naked.  They're driving, taking their clothes off, crashing into a button, Mr. Robin.  I invented traffic accidents.  A bandana around an antenna that reminds me of something else I've heard.  It's called a fucking flag.  That's not exactly somebody's fucking invention.  I invented that, Robin.  They say Betsy Ross did that.  I sewed the stars on.  Hoo-hoo, it was all me.  I don't care. 
[01:06:00]  I don't care.  I honestly don't care.  I don't care.  I invented that.  That was me.  Kirby and Anthony, the virus is spreading.  So something do you believe?  Will you fight the hand and feet?  Will you chew a tell and please?  Can you get up off your knees?  Are you brave enough to see?  Do you want to change it? 
[01:06:30]  Oh, boy.  More trouble in the rap community.  Just when it seems Will Smith is going to bring everything around, I guess Will Smith  has one big introduction to make at Tuesday night's BET Awards.  Gangsta rappers meet the rest of the world.  He wants to inform the rap community they have a big influence on culture around the world  and to stop this whole thug-gangsta image. 
[01:07:00]  Be more like Will Smith.  That's right.  Hitch was funny.  Yee.  Hoo.  And, boy, his words can't come quickly enough, Opie, because as I'm reading here,  there's a rap festival that goes throughout the summer, has a few dates.  They tour.  It's called Super Safe Sunday.  And its goal is to get black youth off the streets into a safe environment to keep them safe  and to cut down on the black-on-black crime that's going on. 
[01:07:30]  And the headline,  Another Super Safe Sunday Ends in Violence.  Three people shot, one dead, four injured during Super Safe Sunday.  That's terrific.  Yowch.  That's terrific.  Despite police from organizers for nonviolence, three people were shot and another stabbed  as another Super Safe Sunday event turned bloody.  Local radio personality Jabberjaws, who is also of Jabbo Productions, the group co-sponsoring 
[01:08:00]  the event, in Shreveport, Louisiana, at the state fairgrounds, asked the crowd to go home  after the concert, but they didn't go home.  There was at least 5,000 people there.  About 9.30.  Between 30 and 40 shots were fired into a crowd.  30 and 40 shots. 
[01:08:30]  Muzzle fire from the unknown gun shots broke through the night sky.  And, yeah, three people shot, one killed on Super Safe Sunday.  It has three more scheduled events this summer, July 10th, July 24th, and August 7th.  And on June 12th, the first Super Safe Sunday this summer, a 14-year-old boy was intentionally  run over by a car.  That's classic.  Super Safe Sunday. 
[01:09:00]  Wow.  You know, those wrap events are just trouble.  Is that a picture of Super Safe Sunday?  Wow.  That sure don't look safe.  That looks quite scary.  That doesn't look like Slightly Safe Sunday.  Ooh.  That looks like, ah, we'll give it a try.  Oh, my God.  To be safe this Sunday.  That looks like, ask, where's Hotel Rwanda?  Ask for directions to Hotel Rwanda Sunday.  That looks like, find Whitey. 
[01:09:30]  Wow, yeah.  Where's Whitey?  Where's Whitey?  Find him in that crowd.  It's a little guy with a red and white sweater with a black eye and a pistol at his head.  All right, Anthony, it's Whip Him Out Wednesday.  Yes, it is.  Better than Super Safe Sunday.  Whip Him Out Wednesday.  Whip Him Out Wednesday.  We absolutely love.  You get wow on your car for the new listeners or a wow on your truck.  And if the ladies feel like it, they're going to flash you while you're driving around.  We basically tell you, don't harass the ladies.  There's plenty of women out there that will do this just for the hell of it.  You don't have to try to overly encourage the women to do it, okay? 
[01:10:00]  If you don't have a wow sticker yet, you can make one and throw it on the back of your rider.  You can send in a self-addressed stamped envelope to us here in New York City.  The address is up on opianthony.com.  With that said, Anthony, really fast.  Yeah.  We've got a strip club, or isn't it Delilah's in Philadelphia?  But they don't like being called a strip club, right?  Gentleman's Club.  You don't know what to call them anymore.  In the old days, you just said a strip club.  A gentleman's club.  A strip club.  It's a gentleman's club.  It's a dance club.  It's this.  A ladies' club. 
[01:10:30]  What?  Strip joint.  Strip joint.  Look at that gentleman wearing these silk sweatpants with no underwear.  He's a gentleman.  I'm a front.  What a gentleman.  We do love Delilah's.  Delilah's.  Delilah's.  Delilah's.  Sorry.  Delilah's.  You have to say the name right.  I know.  I know.  We used to do some stuff with them when we were on.  I love Dillinger's.  What?  We used to do a lot of stuff with them when we were at WYSP in Philadelphia.  Pardon me, missy.  May I see your tits? 
[01:11:00]  I'm a fine gentleman.  Delilah's.  Okay.  We've got a bunch of exotic dancers.  A.K.A. strippers.  They're coming up Friday?  They're coming up Friday.  And they're going to have tiny, tiny little things on.  Oh.  And they're going to walk around Manhattan handing out wow stickers.  That's what we do now.  Yeah.  We're marketing ourselves.  We make the girls work for us.  So the girls are going to be walking all around Manhattan handing out wow stickers.  Hold on, Jimmy, because I see how pissed you are over there.  Oh, no.  Let me just get this thought finished. 
[01:11:30]  Do we want listeners and other hot girls to join us to hand out wow stickers all day Friday in Manhattan?  It can't hurt.  Sorry.  I'm distracted by Jim.  All right.  I love the idea of the hot chicks, the strippers coming in and doing something like that for the show in Times Square or something like that?  Yeah.  We'll have them walk down.  We'll design the road.  Actually, you mean actually serving a purpose on this show?  Yeah.  Yeah, having strippers that actually do something worthwhile for the program.  And they are hot girls, so.  Do you guys want to put out the word that listeners could join them and hot girls could join them or no? 
[01:12:00]  I'd rather put out the word, really.  Can we just do that?  I've been working on the put and the but.  I know.  That's what I heard.  I heard put and I'd rather put.  I don't understand what goes on in my brain every time I have to say but.  Thank Christ.  It's driving me nuts.  It stops my whole thought process.  How did that happen?  Because some asshole listener had to point it out.  I've been saying but.  No, I mean how did you start saying but in school?  Wasn't it a P?  Dude, I've been saying that word. 
[01:12:30]  I don't know.  Really?  I was listening to an old bit that has to be six or seven years ago.  I'm going but, but, but, but, but, but, but.  Really?  And no one picked up on it until we started here at XM.  And now every time I have to say put, my brain physically stops working so it can think about how to say that one stupid word.  I know what the problem is, by the way.  The way, like, when you say P, your brain, the way you say P, like, we all have to think out what we're saying even though it's very quiz.  Yeah.  And you don't think P, you think upside down B. 
[01:13:00]  Did it, did it, was it because of not popping your P's into a microphone?  Maybe.  Because sometimes they teach you to almost say but, but they, you know, not but, but, like, put a softer P without popping your P's in the microphone.  Closive.  That could, that could be it.  Yeah.  That could be it.  Yeah, that's what they teach in this stupid broadcasting class.  They teach you that.  Closive.  Closive your P's, yeah.  When they say DPs?  Closive.  So, yeah, like, Ben has a huge penis, you would say.  Instead, not so you don't pop it. 
[01:13:30]  So, we're going to put out the word, right?  Yeah, we'll put, and we'll put a route on the website and all that stuff.  So, do we want listeners to show up Friday?  Yeah, why not?  Some listeners to show up Friday with hot girls?  Yeah.  And we'll have a whole box of wow stickers and we're going to walk around Manhattan handing them out.  We've got to really start promoting this damn show, especially here in New York City.  So, I'm going to go down, you know, 7th Avenue, and so if your office is along 7th Avenue.  All right.  So, Friday, we'll start walking at what?  7.30.  7, 7.30.  Maybe they can hand them out to the black Israelites that always speak on Broadway in front of the Viacom building. 
[01:14:00]  Oh, those guys are nuts.  Those scary monsters.  Yeah, they're enchanting gentlemen.  All right.  We've got freaks all over.  Hard workers.  Enchanting.  Okay.  By the way, when this kid comes back, can somebody ask where he got this fruit?  Uh-oh.  What makes you angrier?  And I want to ask the listeners this.  What makes you want to smash somebody with a bat more than a mealy orange?  An orange that doesn't break up into segments because it's like a conglomerated, malada, mongrel class of orange. 
[01:14:30]  Both pieces of fruit will be destroyed.  Know what I hate about oranges?  When you get that orange tumor.  Oh, yeah, the big thing by the navel.  Within your orange, all of a sudden you've got like an orange tumor.  It's like a quato orange growing inside the orange.  I'm not just talking around the navel.  Sometimes it just takes over.  Why is my orange coughing?  Oh, I see.  Put a little robe on it.  It's not segmenting, is it?  No, I opened it up and I just saw that it's like the mealy. 
[01:15:00]  When you open an orange, it should be just a little, a bevy of juicy deliciousness.  Juicy mess.  Yes.  This is juicy, but it's got like, when you, when you look at your, when you cut an orange  in a four, it's got like a little, the little teeny million slices on each side of the, of  the, uh, the actual juicy part of the orange.  It almost looks like shredded string.  Yeah, yeah, it's stringy.  And, um, where'd you get this orange?  That's an awful orange.  Uh, I went to the other deli where I was told to get sweet.  Great.  Okay, so you.  The only orange is grown in Alaska. 
[01:15:30]  She's poor.  Nothing?  No, no, no.  I asked what I got.  Poor young go-getters.  They're all sweating.  Jesus.  Every day they, they, they, they, they, they, they, they, they, they, they, they, they,  they, they, they, they, they, they, they, they, they, they, they, they, they, they, they, they, they, they.  No, what did you say?  I made a cold-weather orange joke.  Orange is grown in Alaska.  I know.  I heard it.  I just wanted to hear it twice.  And, Anthony, I'll hear it on the replay.  Of course you will.  Because I missed that one.  Jimmy ropes me into saying it again.  No, he did it right.  He got to the right place.  I was just wondering, because you can't tell it orange on the outside.  It looked orange.  What is wrong with it? 
[01:16:00]  It's just mealy and awful.  He's talking back to you now.  No, he's not.  Oh, what's wrong with it?  Did you hear him?  What's wrong with it?  No, it's a mealy mess they are.  Harry and the gang, they're in a panic every morning with our food orders.  I feel bad for these guys.  Why?  That's not a bad thing.  They get all nervous.  They get all nervous.  They hover over us as we open up our breakfasts to make sure it's okay.  I like opening the front door when I'm coming into the studio.  I'm being accosted by an intern asking me what I want to eat before I even get to the office.  What do you want to eat? 
[01:16:30]  I'm freaking out.  They, like, lose their minds.  They've been thinking about it for 20 minutes.  Yeah.  They've been thinking, here he is.  Food, what?  What do you have?  No, like, let me sit.  I just had dinner.  It's still nighttime.  Ass.  I get called on my way in.  I get the phone call.  Do you get called now?  Every day.  I get a phone call.  Hi, this is, uh, today it'll be Travis, or not today it wasn't Travis, it was another gentleman,  Harry.  Of course, he doesn't work here.  Yeah, it's just some young strapping kid.  It might have been Sam.  Uh, yeah, I figured it was. 
[01:17:00]  But, um, I was Harry, Harry today, because I dialed the number.  I dialed the number for him.  All right.  The worst is when they say, what do you want to eat?  And you say the same thing as yesterday, but they didn't get it yesterday, so.  Oh, yeah.  They're good.  They're good guys.  There's so many of them now.  They don't know.  They can't keep track of who went for food.  So, you know, three or four times every morning you're asked, what do you want to eat?  Ah, what do I want?  The thing I sent the first guy out for.  When he brings it back, that's what I want to eat.  Why don't you get somebody some coffee?  Let's go to Alan in Virginia.  Alan. 
[01:17:30]  Hey, guys.  What's up?  Oh, Virginia.  What's up, Alan?  Well, you know, you're talking about mispronouncing words, and about ten times a day, Anthony says  olden with an R in there, and I could be wrong, but I think it's O-L-D-E-N, just in the olden  days.  Oh, I say the olden days all the time.  Is that a real word?  Olden.  It's kind of like a play.  When you hear people say, back in ye olden days, I understand what Anthony's saying.  I wouldn't seriously use the word, no matter how it's said. 
[01:18:00]  Yeah.  I would hope not.  And, Jimmy, you've got one, too, that you say once in a great while.  If there was a country on the planet called Lo-Ass, I guess there would be a Lo-Asian  boy from that country.  Lo-Asian?  Isn't it?  La-O-Asian?  La-O-Asian.  Is it La-O-Asian?  La-O-Asian.  From Laos.  Let's see.  And, Anthony, you pronounce finger weird.  You give it that soft...  You're the fucking finger guy.  I hate you, you dickbag shit fuck.  Why?  This asshole criticizes me online about how I say finger. 
[01:18:30]  I'm not the guy.  I don't even have...  You're a fucking finger guy.  Hey, dude, what's wrong with the way I say finger?  I know this is a little weird.  What is it?  I don't know.  So you get afraid of the G and dance around it.  I say finger.  Finger.  And, Opie, it's real easy on the you and I thing.  You say you and I in every circumstance, and just drop part of the sentence, and you'll  know whether it's proper to say you and I or you and me.  If you say, somebody was talking to Anthony and I, just drop Anthony and... 
[01:19:00]  I gave up on the you and me, you and I thing years ago.  I say me and Opie.  That's right.  To everything.  Even if Opie's not there.  That's right.  I just say me and Opie.  I do too, even if it doesn't involve me or Opie.  Right.  You and I, you and me, most listeners don't give a shit.  All of you are guilty whenever you're talking about retarded people and saying he's got  a missing chromosome.  I think when you have Downs, you actually have one too many, don't you?  Ooh, very good.  But if you're missing one, you have something else that isn't too pleasant either.  So I wouldn't worry about it. 
[01:19:30]  All right.  Hey, hey, dude, what's wrong with finger, though?  Oh, nothing.  It's just something I'm just busting off.  No, I want to know.  Like, what am I saying wrong?  How do I say it?  I'll put my finger right in your eye.  Oh, instead of doing finger with a hard G, you say finger like a telephone ringer.  Finger.  Finger.  Like ringer?  Finger.  Right.  Yeah, finger.  Dude, holy nitpick.  Holy nitpick.  Oh, I know.  I'm an asshole.  No, you're not.  You probably need a very good finger.  Finger.  I just love calling you guys.  Anthony, can I ask you one quick question? 
[01:20:00]  All right.  What, Alan?  Years ago, before the L&A buffet came to town, and I had to get on my radio at the Howard  Stern Soup Kitchen.  Yes.  I used to, I watched a pay-per-view one time.  They were having a Jackie Soundalike concert, and I swear, I wish I still had it on tape.  Oh, it wasn't a pay-per-view, dude.  It was an e-show.  It was one of the e-shows.  For one Christmas, like right before I hooked up with Opie, yeah, it was on Howie's show.  Did I watch you?  Yeah.  Actually, you mentioned the Opie show.  Yeah, I said I work on the Opie show. 
[01:20:30]  Oh, it's been so long ago.  I just remember some wild-looking guy in line just, how are you?  Oh, I know.  I know, I had like crazy hair, and yeah, I was back in the olden days, if I may point  my finger at that word.  That's to jack off.  That's before Anthony turned into a freak.  Right.  You can pronounce anything, any way you want.  I'm still a freak.  He used to look like a freak.  Now he is a freak.  Yeah.  You really were an odd-looking fellow with that like, bushy hair.  I had that big, bushy hair.  Well, you know, my whole goal back then was to make it in my band, and that whole look 
[01:21:00]  was I used to tease that afro out on stage.  What was your band called, the Juan Epsteins?  It was a rotgut, my friend.  I'd wear a silver LeMay jacket and boxer shorts on stage.  Oh, believe me.  No, you wouldn't.  Oh, I absolutely would.  You guys talked it over.  This is not true.  You certainly wouldn't.  It was a freak show on stage.  Yep.  A keyboard player wore his mother's dress. 
[01:21:30]  Alan, that's it for today.  Awful.  You can call again, though, right?  Bye, Alan.  All right, guys.  Have a good one.  Thank you.  Yep.  Finger.  I've heard that from a couple of people, but that's not even an odd way to say it.  Finger.  Finger.  Yeah, you say finger.  I should say finger and split it up like that?  Finger?  No, no, no.  You don't have to slow it down.  It's just a natural flow.  I'll put my finger right there on it.  I don't know anyone in...  Have fun.  I've heard people say it just like me.  Finger.  No one says it.  Finger.  Have fun, because now every time that word comes up in your head, it's going to be a nightmare. 
[01:22:00]  You should embrace that G.  I put my finger in my nose.  All right!  I want you to embrace that G.  Finger.  Hold that G.  You don't say E-Wiz, do you?  Vagina.  No?  When do I use that?  Vagina.  Let's get back on track.  I pray to God.  Let's get back on track, because we have so much...  Jod is great.  Jod is good.  We've got to get back on track.  We're just wasting another 20 minutes doing it.  We do so much nothingness on this show.  That's what most people do in their lives, though.  That's why they like us. 
[01:22:30]  News teases.  Not even a news tease.  Just your local news just getting...  This is what we're looking for from the rest of the country.  Your local news is getting wacky.  Your local news scaring the shit out of you with their teases.  Yeah.  Anything else?  And anything else out of the ordinary, I guess.  Yeah.  In general.  Any alarmist stuff, where somebody's on the news just scaring the piss out of you with  their teases?  Well, that's the main thing we're looking for, yes.  But then the other stuff, where they're getting a little too wacky.  They're just...  Something just out of the ordinary, as well. 
[01:23:00]  Do we have an example of...  Do we have that line that that stupid news guy said?  Yeah, that's what I'm getting at.  Oh, okay.  Great.  Well, just to set this up, in New York City, it's really humid.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  It's very soupy out.  Very moist out, yeah.  What other words they use?  A sticky.  It's like pea soup.  Oh, pea soup, yeah.  It's just really humid.  It's going to rain any second, like just thunderstorms all day, because the moisture can't hang out 
[01:23:30]  in the air anymore.  Right.  Anyway, so one of the local news guys had this to say this morning.  6.31 on this Wednesday, June 29, 2005.  Thanks for joining us, but it has felt like August for a while now, hasn't it?  That's right.  Jonathan Cohen, who runs the assignment desk for us, says humidity is for cigars.  It's not for people.  Humidors.  Humidors, that's right.  It's going to feel like you're standing in one today.  We'll have a check on the forecast at 6.35.  But first, Lucy Nolan has the day's news.  Good morning, Lucy. 
[01:24:00]  Humidity is for cigars.  Wow.  Oof.  How awful.  Newscasters should never try to have personality.  They all try.  They had another news guy today sticking his face in, like, running water or something.  Yeah.  What was that about?  I don't know.  Another wacky thing he's doing.  And they're like, wow, that looks refreshing.  But that was their small talk. 
[01:24:30]  That was it.  Well, you know, the heat.  The guy, basically, it was like a little waterfall in front of him.  Uh-huh.  And he's the weather dude that, you know, he's the local weather guy they have to send out  to do stupid shit.  The wacky stuff.  So he's talking behind the water.  So his face is distorted by the water.  But then he moves his face into it slightly to get a little wet.  And then the anchor woman has to go, wow, that looks refreshing.  Hey, what'd he do?  Sorry.  Interesting piece of email just showed up.  And I can't really figure out why this guy's so pissed off. 
[01:25:00]  Well, we're trying to move on here, though.  You couldn't wait on this?  It's all right.  He gives his name.  Huge fan of O&A since 98.  I was in the XM studio a few days after Christmas and happy to meet everyone.  Tried calling into the show when I can add to it.  But I enjoy listening as well.  This morning, my friends and I were listening to the part where you guys called in.  Oh, the guy called in.  And said, your car sucks.  And used Volkswagen as a better example.  When I called in to comment, your douchebag screener yells into the receiver, 
[01:25:30]  we've moved on and hangs up on me.  All of us were sickened that a loyal listener way before your stupid hick listeners on XM,  that is the way we were treated.  Just to let you know, all of our wow stickers have been ripped off the cars.  I'm not giving O&A any more free publicity.  Let the douchebags buy ads like I have on my radio show.  Stop trying to weasel free shit when they're making much more than most people are.  Since I do a radio show, I'm not going to give negative attention to O&A because they like any attention. 
[01:26:00]  However, I can simply turn off from XM radio.  No XM, no Opie and Anthony.  Soon enough, they won't have to worry about Howie.  They won't make it till then.  You guys are pieces of shit.  Just because Danny hung up on him?  What a baby.  You know, dude, go fuck yourself.  What a fucking baby.  Leave.  This is a perfect opportunity to explain what goes on.  Our phones ring nonstop, starting way before the show even starts. 
[01:26:30]  Way before.  And we're trying to get as many people on the air as possible.  So when we're done with the subject, we can't politely go, oh, sorry that you waited 20 minutes, but the guys have moved on.  We have to screen the calls immediately and get you guys off hold.  Sometimes, you know what I do?  Because you'll be on hold, and all of a sudden you'll hear the phone just click.  Sometimes I just take the mouse and hang up on seven, eight people at a time. 
[01:27:00]  Because we don't have time to be polite.  We're trying to do a national talk show.  And sometimes we have to be rude.  If you're listening to this show, you've got to understand that.  You know, we probably put more people on the radio than any other radio show out there,  but we also have to hang up on people or be rude.  You know, Danny's got to go, thanks, we're moving on, thanks, we're moving on, thanks, we're moving on.  Yeah.  He'll do that all morning.  He'll hang up on ten people saying that exact thing over and over again.  Steve?  Yeah.  Did you answer him at Giants416 at MSN.com? 
[01:27:30]  I did.  I was a little perplexed as to why he was so pissed off, especially since he had mentioned that he had a radio show.  But you answered him at Giants416 at MSN.com, right?  Is that what it says?  I think it is at the top.  I can't really read it.  I can't see it from here.  Well, I don't know how this...  Just to let you all...  We've taken the WOW stickers have been ripped off our cars.  I'll show you no tits.  Dope.  What an asshead.  Like, as loyal listeners...  What are you fucking... 
[01:28:00]  You trying to call our manager?  As a loyal listener, I didn't appreciate that.  Who knows you're a loyal...  Everyone gets hung up on that way.  I've called into radio shows, like Joe Benigno on WFAN.  I'm a big fan.  Called him a couple of times.  And the way it works, and I was a little thrown the first time, is that, like, you know, you'll be in mid-thought.  And he'll go, yeah, okay.  And all of a sudden, you're off the air.  And he starts talking about somebody.  It's not to be rude.  It's because there's a flow.  Yeah, just...  What's the show going on, idiot?  Guys, you've just got to understand the show.  We can't be polite.  Sometimes I'll just hang up on you from where I sit, and sometimes Danny has time to say thanks for calling. 
[01:28:30]  You know, but we don't have time to be nice to everybody.  We have to move on.  I'd love to know...  I'm sorry.  I'd love to know what Pete DeFelice...  You got a radio show.  We'll plug it.  We don't care.  Since I do a radio show, I'm not going to give negative...  Shut up.  A radio show?  What radio...  And if you did a radio show, wouldn't you understand and know how it works with a quality?  Obviously, you don't do a radio show.  You do maybe something you think is a radio show.  What an asshole. 
[01:29:00]  If he just rode in and said, hey, guys, could you tell the screener to be a little nicer?  We'd probably be shitting all over Danny and fucking with him right now and having a good time.  Yeah.  That Carmine Ragusa hung up on you like that.  We hover behind him and watch him.  He's as nice as he possibly can be, considering the hundreds of calls.  Let me tell you, we got a lot of guys behind the scenes that work their asses off.  That's the toughest job right there.  That is a pain-in-the-ass job.  I did it early on.  I think it's thankless.  Good point.  And right now, Derek wants to spit on him because he gets the toughest job credit.  I did that job early in my career.  We've gone through a lot of phone screeners over the years, Anthony and I, because you just get burnt out. 
[01:29:30]  Yeah.  Because you have to answer phones for four hours straight.  Four hours straight, he's answering phones, and he has to decide, well, thanks for calling, but we can't use you.  All right, stay on hold.  I mean, it's a pain in the ass.  All the wow stickers have been ripped off the cars.  Ugh.  Really?  Bye-bye.  Can you go out there to look at a little ice scraper?  No more free publicity for those two.  Yeah.  I'll show them. 
[01:30:00]  Oh, you really showed us, buddy.  No one cares, Pete.  Wow, you must be something in radio.  Yeah.  You put his name in a search engine, nothing comes up.  You know what?  I'm going to call him a faggot.  Oh, wow.  Easy.  Wow.  Good thing Anthony didn't say, because you would have been called a fan.  By the way, Marcia makes a great point here.  Marcia.  Yeah, they were nice to me when I called.  Maybe he's just an asshole.  Look, I'm hanging up on Rose and John, and the rest of the world won't even know.  Do it nicely, Opie. 
[01:30:30]  That's right.  No, I just went click, click, because I'm trying to clear phone lines.  See, that's what we do.  Bye, Marcia, Marcia, Marcia.  But Marcia made it through.  What's up, Marcia?  I just wanted to tell you I'm a new listener, and I absolutely love the show.  And if President Bush can say nuclear every time, you guys can pronounce things however you want to.  Well, all I hear all day long at school is how great Marcia did this, or how wonderful Marcia did that.  Marcia, Marcia, Marcia.  Yeah.  Yeah, I am pretty wonderful, aren't I?  Marcia, Marcia, Marcia. 
[01:31:00]  Hey, you guys.  Oh, my, no.  And you know what, Marcia?  We're glad you called in, because we value you more than those old listeners.  Right.  We don't need the Pete DeFelices of the world.  We want the new Marcias.  That's right.  Now, fuck off.  That's right.  Fall down an elevator, champ, whore.  All right, here we go.  Hopefully she understands this program, or we did just lose another one. 
[01:31:30]  All right, so the shark story, Anthony, yes.  Very, very important story.  And then we'll get to the pop culture quiz with Norton.  They are still giving instructions on how to avoid being attacked by a shark, even though,  as we went through yesterday, there's been, like, 12 deaths from shark attacks in 100 years.  It's ridiculous.  More than 100 years.  Yeah.  Whatever.  But today they had an expert in front of a fish tank. 
[01:32:00]  Yeah.  At an aquarium.  At an aquarium in front of a fish tank with a shark in it.  It's a fish tank with a shark in it.  Like, any tie-in.  All right.  And I look a little too deep into the news, as we all do here in the studio,  because we've been affected by the stupid news so many times.  And I just picture what the production meeting is beforehand, you know, the assignment meetings.  All right, you, I got this great idea. 
[01:32:30]  You go to the aquarium and do your stand-up in front of the shark tank.  Oh, that's a good one.  Yeah, okay, get the truck and get...  Like, it's a good idea.  Just more...  Gotta scare the public.  Show that shark swimming around behind.  Look at this guy.  He can rip your fucking head off.  Thank God he's in a tank.  Right.  They don't do that with other things.  Like, you don't hear a story about pedophilia.  They just pan, like, you know, priest headshots.  Fucking assholes.  Stand by a church.  Yeah, exactly. 
[01:33:00]  Walking in and out, waving.  Dude, I got the greatest idea, but I can't say it on the air.  But somehow we've got to figure this out, what I was telling you in the office.  You love me and want to...  Oh, that other thing.  Yes, the other thing.  And I want us to move to Canada so we can finally get married.  Hey, huh?  Yeah.  Good one, Canada.  Yeah.  We're going to have all Americans faggots going up there.  Ah, well, eh.  Yeah, they kind of did something up there where you're able to get hitched if you're gay.  Yeah, maybe we can find that. 
[01:33:30]  We'll find the AP clips in a second.  Canada's nice.  Focus, guys, focus.  Sorry.  But I do have a great idea.  Whatever.  Can you tell me later?  Maybe we can stand nose to nose and you can just tell me.  Which one was it?  I can't remember now.  All right.  It's very early in the morning.  In the morning.  Honestly, I know we like to ruin things.  Don't ruin this one.  Ah.  No, I'm dead serious because this could be beyond funny.  C.  No, stop, man.  A P.  No, stop.  Don't.  R.  L.  Run around the park for Jean Benet. 
[01:34:00]  Oh, cowboy hat.  Oh, yeah.  I didn't see it.  Yeah, we got to get that done.  Don't ruin it.  Can I say it?  I won't ruin it.  I promise.  I promise, Jimmy.  But it's got to be pretty quick.  Huh?  We got to get it done.  I know.  How do we figure this out?  I know we could get it done if I mention it somehow mentioned on the air, but.  But what?  Might be a problem?  How would it be a problem if it is mentioned on the air?  Well, then people would be on to us, too, that it was us. 
[01:34:30]  Yeah, but if that happens, I don't think they'll care who the hell did it or why.  You know?  Dude.  All this speculation.  The news.  Does it mean Ron and Fez is coming to XM?  Yes.  The news.  By the way, anything we speculate on this show now, as far as whackbag.com is concerned,  is all about Ron and Fez coming here.  Remember we were talking about certain interns, former interns that are going to have jobs here  and when they start?  Yeah.  And we were being very vague yesterday about July 5th. 
[01:35:00]  Yeah.  It was a whole speculation on how Ron and Fez are coming to XM on July 5th.  It was, I was reading it going, these friggin' idiots will speculate anything.  They just knock it around on that message board and it always comes back to Ron and Fez.  So this one, yeah, it's another Ron and Fez speculation.  I talked to Ronnie yesterday.  He's doing fine.  You're dead?  Ronnie and Fez.  All right, here's the deal.  The media would just be all over this.  Yeah, this is a catch-22.  What do we do?  We could put the word out or we try to do it on our own, but then how do you get that? 
[01:35:30]  Exactly.  We need a prop.  It is a prop, but it's a prop, but it's a real thing.  It's not a fake version of what we need.  We need it.  I know.  It's got to be delivered somewhere.  Damn it.  I know.  We just say what we need and we have it tomorrow.  You think?  All right, we've got to think about this for a second.  A lot of fishermen out there?  Shut up.  All right.  So the shark thing, Anthony. 
[01:36:00]  Yes, the shark thing.  They found a shark in the New York area and they exploited the shit out of it over...  Of course they did.  ...last night on the news.  And we got some news teases.  Shark story's huge.  A couple of people, one killed, one injured down there in Florida.  So anything they could do to tie it into the local angle, they'll do.  So there was a shark found in Queens.  The Rockaways or whatever?  Yeah.  Washed up, right?  Washed up.  Oh, well.  Would you hear a detailed version of the news?  Because if you listen to the teases, it was shark in our area. 
[01:36:30]  Right.  Dude, they were making it sound...  I'll read what it actually was.  Yeah.  But this is what the news does.  And I'm so happy that we're finally exploiting what the news does.  And Ed and I talked about this when we were on hiatus and had us sit around for two years waiting to do a radio show again.  And this was a direction we wanted to go in, where we just got a lot of audio clips and just exploited the bullshit that is out there in general.  And I'm so glad we're finally getting a chance to do this.  Because with our story with the sex at St. Pat's thing, the shit that came out of these people's mouths... 
[01:37:00]  Yeah, just lies.  Yeah, I understand it was a horrible thing, blah, blah, blah.  But they made it so much worse than it really was.  And a light bulb went off in my head like, oh, when we get back, we're going to have some fun with the local news and other stuff that happens on your damn TV.  But anyway, so there was a shark found in the Rockaways here in New York City, and the news had a field day last night.  So listen to a couple of these things.  We'll play the story, and then I'll tell you exactly what it was, okay? 
[01:37:30]  Right.  Next up, frightening find right here on a local beach, a shark washes ashore.  Is it cause for concern?  We talk to a local expert next on the WB11 News at 10.  All right, at least he said a wash is ashore.  At least he did.  The one I watched last night, they didn't.  They just said shark in our area.  But listen, is it a reason for concern?  If you're afraid of being attacked by a dead animal, it is.  You know, if you walk up, it could be dangerous.  You walk up and open the mouth and just kick your shin into its teeth. 
[01:38:00]  It could really hurt you.  A broken down car found on the side of the road.  Is drunk driving a danger?  What?  What?  Exactly.  By the way, Fred from Brooklyn?  Yes.  Yes.  Oh, wow.  Yes, Fred.  Yes.  Very sharp, Fred.  Yes.  Yes.  Someone talk to Fred.  Talk to Fred.  At length.  Get some dimensions and see what the hell the deal is.  All right, here we go.  So there you go.  You're Joe Viewer at home, and you see this. 
[01:38:30]  You're like, holy crap, Anthony.  He's Jimmy.  But you're like, what the fuck?  I'm going to the beach this weekend, and now the shark's in our...  Oh, we were just going to go to the beach.  And now you've got that little fear building up inside you.  Did they interview anybody?  I was very frightened when the shark washed ashore, because we're going to the beach this weekend.  I got the story.  You're not going to believe it.  Would you want to swim with this?  Which area of beach did he wash upon?  And why your pet could be in danger if you use an invisible fence next. 
[01:39:00]  Oh, danger.  Danger.  Fear, fear, fear.  Danger, danger, danger.  You know, when you point it out, it really is absurd.  Why do they have to ask, what beach did this watch?  Why not just tell us?  Pause, they want you to watch.  Because they want everyone to watch, because it could be your local beach.  They want you to be afraid whether you're on the North Shore or Long Island, the South Shore, Montauk, Brooklyn, Jersey.  Be afraid.  They didn't even say Long Island Beach.  No.  It could be a Jersey beach. 
[01:39:30]  As soon as they say the beach, then everyone else that's not in that area, they don't care about that.  Sharks on our planet?  Tune in.  Of course.  They have to, you know...  But the news is not supposed to be about ratings.  It's supposed to be about just giving information, right?  Because the news division is not supposed to make money.  Isn't that true?  They always generalize to get everyone involved.  And then slowly, as they're finally talking about the particular story, then at the end  of it, then they finally narrow it down that it's just one little beach in the middle of 
[01:40:00]  Rockaways.  What's your address, Jimmy?  I got the perfect world part, but what's the street address?  Jesus.  Talking about the news.  Isn't it supposed to be?  Yeah, golly!  Oh, no, no, no, no.  I was kind of saying that's sarcastic.  I know.  Oh, okay.  I understand.  I didn't really mean that.  I was like, oh, gee, jeepers, why can't we all just...  Let's put on a show.  Here we go.  And then go to a safer Sunday.  Right now, on the Insider and Entertainment Tonight. 
[01:40:30]  Two teenagers attack.  Is it the work of one killer shark?  Get ready to be an insider.  Could there be a real-life Jaws on the loose?  Latest on Young Craig, as little Jamie is about to be laid to rest.  I just want to eat your pussy.  I want you to bite Betsy's leg off and swim around with her blood all over your snout.  If you like this idea, just don't evolve for 60 million years. 
[01:41:00]  That's very funny.  That's great.  I'm sorry.  I just want to take my mouth and latch on you like a pilot fish.  I just want to latch on underneath your lip and eat your scraps.  I normally don't do this, but I don't know.  Let's just go fucking crazy.  Let's just eat the Kintner boy.  Let's just have a license plate in our stomachs.  I just want to put on a suit jacket with anchors on it and close the beaches. 
[01:41:30]  If you're into this, bite some Italian guy's leg off with a perfectly tied sneaker on it.  I just want to go fucking crazy.  If you like this, just look at me and roll back your eyes as you feed.  I'll do drugs.  I'll drink to your leg.  Come on.  But you've got to act like you're into Robert Shaw.  You've got to act like you're into... 
[01:42:00]  Stupid Pat O'Brien.  Shut up, Pat.  That's great.  Be an insider.  Is that the tag they use for everything?  Insider.  Well, now they're teasing that it might be one killer shark with a brain.  One killer shark.  Yeah, that's what it is.  Swimming around.  All right, so...  Drama.  We all want to live in the movies, don't we?  With the drama and the danger.  Stop it.  Well, they said they thought it might be one shark just because the 911 call confessions 
[01:42:30]  with the same voice on both.  Glub, glub.  It was me.  Ten marks all over the phone.  All right, finally, here's the local story about the shark in our area.  This time it wasn't a shark attack, but a shark surprise when one washed up on the beach,  leaving many wondering what's lurking off our coast.  Corian Mahalik is in Rockaway Beach with the latest for us.  Good evening, Corian.  Good evening, Brenda.  At this hour, experts have a very good idea how this dead shark got here. 
[01:43:00]  While bathers are wondering, is it safe to go back in the water?  We saw a white bubble in the water and the waves kept pushing it, pushing it towards us  and a shark.  Little Victoria and her family could not believe their eyes.  Get a load of this.  This shark was rolling around in the water close to shore.  We were scared.  We thought it was alive still.  This blue shark was seen popping out of the water until the Parks Department folks managed  to drag him in.  Right away, we pulled everybody out of the water until we could see what it was. 
[01:43:30]  And Patricia took these photos as it was brought to shore.  Wow, here on Rockaway Beach?  I couldn't believe it.  Folks alarmed, especially after two recent shark attacks along the Florida panhandle.  One of them killing this girl.  Had a hook in its mouth?  Yes.  Well, there was a leader coming out of the mouth and it looked like the shark had probably  swallowed the hook.  Hans, the shark researcher for the New York Aquarium, says it appears a fisherman may have  lost this blue shark. 
[01:44:00]  This is not a sign that more of his buddies are going to come in close to shore.  You know, he's, again, he is a deep water shark.  A shark is a shark.  You don't know what it's going to do.  What do you think you'll do now?  I think we'll hang out and just pretend it never happened.  So you'll still go back in the water?  Yes.  And the shark is now in the hands of the experts for further examination.  We're live in Rockaway Beach, Koran Mahalik, UPN 9 News.  The last time I saw a mouth like that, I had a hook in it.  See?  I'm really pissed off right now. 
[01:44:30]  Yeah.  Why?  That's, uh, and I got to give them credit.  That was a fair report by UPN Channel 9 here in New York.  Oh.  It's labeled Fox News.  The Fox News story is so different than the one we just heard.  Where's the Fox News story, Opie?  I don't know.  Uh-oh.  Eric just ran out to hopefully find it.  Let's look in the, let's look in the, uh, room over there.  Look, the arms are being thrown up.  Oh, my God.  But that was still annoying, though, because just, just the fact that the little kid went,  the white thing bubbled up and floated towards us, and then we realized it was just the old publisher of the news day. 
[01:45:00]  Oh.  A thread?  We'll get into that story.  Cumzies floating in the water?  See, because that, that version of the story, they basically say it washed up to shore.  Yeah.  It had a hook in its mouth.  All that fun stuff.  The Fox News story is so drastically different.  Didn't acknowledge the hook in the mouth.  Nope.  Didn't acknowledge that it washed up at first.  It was dumped by a fisherman.  Just the fact that the news would talk about this, though, when you realized what happened was some asshole had it on a rod and reel, 
[01:45:30]  and it fell, and it just washed away.  Basically what they're saying is, you know, off Long Island they have a lot of these, uh, fishing competitions and stuff.  Shark fishing.  Shark fishing and all.  And, uh, you can even see in the picture that there's, like, a bait fish hanging out, uh, out of the shark's mouth.  Okay?  So basically this fish was caught for maybe some kind of competition, and they're saying it either fell off the boat,  or the fisherman said, ah, this ain't gonna win, and it's dead, and what am I gonna do with it, and just threw it overboard.  It'd be like finding a lion with a bullet in its head, and being worried that, lions in our area? 
[01:46:00]  That's right.  Hmm?  The tire washes up.  Are people, are terrorists driving here from across the ocean?  Assholes they are.  Spearmongers.  If I didn't want to fuck Pat Battle so bad, I would never watch the news.  Oh, you know you're getting a good fuck out of Pat Battle, right?  Pat Battle.  I want Pat Battle to be nude below the waist and wear her sports coat, and then strap one on and rail me.  I want Pat Battle to wreck my asshole.  Pat Battle goes into battle. 
[01:46:30]  Pat Battle should be executed.  What an awful name.  Pat Battle.  Pat Battle throws a punch, so she takes it in the ass.  That is, that is the worst name ever.  They interviewed this stupid lady on all the newscasts about this shark.  Yeah.  Here's her quote. 
[01:47:00]  Right away, I thought the shark attacks, the Florida thing.  I said, oh my God, they're coming in here now, too.  So I said to myself, this is gonna be a long summer.  Yeah.  They're trying to find the fox clip, because, like I said, they did not a bad job with that.  No.  Well, it's no chance.  No chance?  Derek's just waving it off.  Really?  No chance of finding it.  Well, Eric ran.  He thought he had it.  It's even labeled Fox News.  I remember this morning.  He was like, oh, I got it.  I got it.  They were teasing, like, where's its mother? 
[01:47:30]  Where's its family?  Are there others?  It was a whole thing.  Hmm.  All right.  Well, we got a couple news teases that are coming in from around the country.  Ready?  Oh, we do already?  Well, we got one from New York and one from Minneapolis.  In the coming days, we'll have a lot more, because that's your homework assignment.  That's your homework now, people.  Minneapolis.  Was it Ted Baxter doing the news?  Sharks in our area, Lou? 
[01:48:00]  Okay.  Mary, don't go to the beach.  Murray, don't go swimming.  Your bald head will shine, and they'll bite it off.  Okay.  Danger in our area.  Okay, pookie.  Chris in the boat, but don't go in, and there might be a shark in the water.  Ted Baxter.  With the news.  It all started for me at a small five... 
[01:48:30]  Five thousand?  I just stink, fuck it.  Five what?  No, I'm not going to do it now.  You got it?  I'll just crash myself.  I'm leaving it at that.  Uh-oh, Eric thinks he has it.  Wait, UPN, not Fox, track three.  Yeah, that was the one.  Uh-oh.  What happened?  What do you mean?  I want the fox.  Your reputation hinges on this.  All right, Eric thinks he has it.  So this is the Fox News version of the shark attack, the shark in our area. 
[01:49:00]  Get there, and does it mean that his friends and family are swimming in our waters?  All right, you clipped it a little bit.  What?  It was UPN, not Fox.  It was UPN, not Fox, Opie.  The one we were talking about was UPN.  No.  The one I just played was UPN.  Uh-oh.  They're fighting.  Let's see what happens here.  Someone call someone a fuckface, and let's move on.  All right, here, Eric.  This one's labeled that I played, Fox News Story, but it was actually UPN.  No, that was a different Fox News Story. 
[01:49:30]  He's getting mouthy.  There's another disc in there that had something else.  It was labeled.  No, but this, what I just played, said UPN 9, news, positive.  Okay.  All right.  He's being uppity, I would say.  So this is the Fox.  He clipped it slightly, but basically the tease was like, you know, does it have friends or  whatever in the area?  Even though this one's dead.  Friends.  So let's listen in.  Get there, and does it mean that his friends and family are swimming in our waters? 
[01:50:00]  Fox 5's Andy Aday has the story from Paul Rockaway.  All right.  I hate this reporter, by the way.  That was Fox 5.  I had it with him.  Wait.  I knew.  But he...  But you said UPN, UPN, UPN.  Yeah, he insisted, and I'm like...  He insisted it was UPN, and the clip says Fox 5 right in it.  Why were you insisting?  What happened?  I labeled it.  Shut up!  Eric, I've been doing this a really long time.  Opie has been doing this since you were not even a speck in dad's balls.  Am I right or wrong, Opie?  Look at the glee behind the glass.  Look at them all cackling and laughing at you, Eric. 
[01:50:30]  Derek in nameless and nameless.  Derek and a couple of shadow people just laughing.  Oh, I sound stupid on a daily basis, but you know what?  There's some real intelligence in this brain.  I just don't want to show it.  I just shun showing it.  I have shadow intelligence.  That's right.  Little glimpses out of the corner of your eye.  I give you a little taste every once in a while, and that's all you get.  You handled it well, though.  I mean, you tried to explain it, Eric, without pointing the fair.  I mean, you did kind of let him know. 
[01:51:00]  Oh, the fair.  Like I say, fair.  Finger.  Finger.  All right, here we go.  Finger, finger, finger.  The wedding's here.  She got a great big finger.  She's a large shark.  This reporter, though, I hate.  She's done stuff on us, and she's like, she's a tiny little thing that she has to be that  act tough reporter.  Yeah.  God, I just wish one person would clock her in the face.  A real go-getter.  A real go-getter, all tough.  Sometimes she wears, like, a leather coat. 
[01:51:30]  Like Lois Lane, out there getting the story.  That's right.  Fucking Superman.  Right.  Always looking for something.  She's the type of reporter that's always looking for something that just flat out is not there,  but continues pushing, pushing, pushing.  Find that angle that no one else finds, even if I have to make it up.  What's your name?  I don't know.  Pat Battle.  No.  So here's the deal.  Pat Battle has a hemorrhoid like a microphone cover.  Just to get everyone back on the same page. 
[01:52:00]  Yeah.  The shark found in our area that washed up on a beach had a bait fish in its mouth and  a hook.  A hook.  She knew that.  Yep.  Okay?  She knew that it was washed ashore.  It had the hook in its mouth.  Yeah.  All right.  That was reported later.  Yeah.  But this is how she...  As we hear on this UPN story...  Right.  Well, listen how she reports it and gives you the fear.  Gives you the fear.  Right.  Get there, and does it mean that his friends and family are swimming in our waters? 
[01:52:30]  Box 5's Envy A Day has the story from Far Rockaway.  I'll get to those questions in just a second, but first, imagine what it was like for people  on this beach when they spotted something all the way out there, rolling around in the  waves.  So I thought, I don't know, it looked like a seal.  And then as it got closer, we saw the fins, and as it got closer, we saw the teeth.  And just check out what rolled up right next to this family.  A shark they'll never forget.  I mean, the teeth were about an inch.  At least an inch. 
[01:53:00]  Experts say it's a blue shark.  The kind that usually live miles and miles offshore on the East Coast.  It's fucking dead.  And that line...  They still haven't said it's a dead shark that rolled up.  She'll say roll up on the beach and stuff, but...  She said rolled up instead of washed, and she said rolled around, because washed means  dead.  Right.  Everyone knows washed, that means dead or boxed.  Rolled around right next to this family.  It's teeth...  Oh, boy.  Sorry, I stepped on your...  Oh, that is funny.  I'm just going to improvise. 
[01:53:30]  The fact that this fucking person said, and we saw the eyes and the teeth.  Did you really, on the dead thing, see the teeth?  On the dead thing.  And it washed up, rolled up right next to this family.  Rolled up like it's in a hoopty.  Like it just rolled up in its car.  With rap music playing.  It was a blue shark.  We thought it was a black shark, because it started firing out the window at the other  shark.  And then it drove away.  Awful.  This woman is trying to make something dangerous out of this.  The kind that usually live miles and miles offshore on the East Coast and swim with a 
[01:54:00]  great white.  So how did it make...  Bring up great white.  Tie it in.  Swim with great white?  What?  They usually live far away.  But they still do.  Yeah.  They still do.  When they're on shore like that, they're dead.  No shark lives on the beach like that.  This fucking thing came pre...  It had a saran wrap around it.  And she's acting like it just fucking drove up and started biting people.  Yeah.  It's a blue shark.  And they swim way out there.  And of course, they have to tie in the great whites.  Great white.  With the great whites. 
[01:54:30]  You have to say great white.  So if this is here, God, there has to be a great white nearby.  She had to bring up the great white in the story.  I hate this one.  Wow.  This is the biggest bullshit story.  Can there be one person in the news that can call us someday and just tell us how a  story like this comes up?  Yeah.  Is there actually somebody that says, all right, get the word great white in there.  I want you guys to say great white.  We need the cat's word.  The words that are going to get attention.  Teeth.  Danger.  Great white.  Shark.  Shark.  It was reported.  Once again, the paper has it right here. 
[01:55:00]  There was a hook in its mouth.  I don't think she mentions that at all.  Rolling up.  That fucking sneak.  Instead of saying washed up.  Rolling up.  Rolling up.  Rolling up does not imply that.  Rolling up.  It's moving.  What?  Rolling.  Yeah, it's rolling.  It's not rolling in the water.  We thought it was a seal.  And then we saw the teeth.  What is it?  How did you see the teeth out there on a dead animal?  It's a dead shark.  Was it yawning?  When it rolled up right next to this family.  And then right after that line, the kids go. 
[01:55:30]  The kids talking about.  Oh, the teeth.  Yeah.  The teeth.  She continues.  Listen to this.  I backed up a little bit.  Okay.  At least an inch.  Experts say it's a blue shark.  The kind that usually live miles and miles offshore on the east coast and swim with a great wife.  So how did it make it to Rockaway Beach?  I think a fisherman caught it on an offshore fishing trip and brought it much closer into  shore and either dumped it or it fell off his boat.  And unlike the potentially dangerous great white, he says the blue shark feeds on fish. 
[01:56:00]  But just the sight of this six-foot monster left people stunned.  I'll tell you one thing.  We didn't go swimming after that.  Why?  And we probably won't go swimming for a while here.  Who cares?  It's the third shark scare in just days.  What?  Third shark scare in just days.  So she's equating a dead animal washing up on the beach with a girl being killed by a shark  and a boy losing his leg to a shark and a shark washing up on the beach. 
[01:56:30]  Trying to link the whole thing like, look, we're involved here now.  We're part of the story.  There's the danger.  But we'll be able to save you because coming up we'll have our safety tips.  I hate these people.  This woman should be punched in the face and forced to eat Pat Battle's ass.  The obsession with Pat Battle.  Who doesn't love the Pat Battle?  No, but I mean not only eat Pat Battle's ass, but after she does an in-depth expose wearing her suit in a steam room. 
[01:57:00]  Could you change that, Hawk?  That's right.  Montel.  We hate the Montel.  That's some news.  I love him.  There we go.  Let's continue here.  And we probably won't go swimming for a while here.  And it's the third shark scare in just days.  This 14-year-old girl was mauled by a shark in Florida and died.  And right after that, attack number two, also in Florida.  A 16-year-old was rushed to the hospital after a shark ripped through his right leg. 
[01:57:30]  It's a risk you take any time you go to the beach.  I hope I'm not the one that the shark takes a top out of my leg.  And the experts say killer sharks don't swim anywhere near our beaches, so you won't run into one of them on July 4th.  In fact, in the past 300 years or so, there have only been five reported shark attacks in New York waters.  Now, they say that blue shark may have been caught in one of the tournaments off Long Island in Far Rockaway.  I'm Andrea Day, Fox 5 News.  See, they finally end it with the info.  Yeah, but the whole buildup is fear, fear, fear. 
[01:58:00]  And then as an aside, it's like, oh, by the way, 300 years.  Oh, by the way, this was nothing.  Yeah, this is a non-story.  By the way, this was nothing.  And thanks for watching.  She would have opened the story and said, you know, that should have been the first few seconds.  A shark washed up on the shores.  But of course they don't.  And the blue shark, which swims with the great white.  And by the way, great white was playing when hundreds died in a club in Rhode Island. 
[01:58:30]  What?  How do you?  But we were...  Can I say that technically fucking seals and everything else swims with the great white because they're in the same thing?  A big body of water?  Yeah, a big body of water.  So technically anyone on the beach swims.  Go to CNN.  Yeah.  Dead shark found a beach in New York.  As you can see, it grew quite a crowd.  All looking at a big dead fish.  Sharks in New York.  Quite a crowd.  Yeah, there was that one guy who was supposedly attacked by the shark, but I don't know if they ever really proved that that's what got him. 
[01:59:00]  But he had an injury to his arm on the New Jersey shark.  It seemed like the thing to claim anyhow because it's the thing that's going on.  Oh boy.  Well, I just want to watch it up.  So maybe it was true.  Maybe it was true.  Yeah.  All right.  Thank you, Carol.  U.S. military helicopter.  It's all about sharks.  Shark, shark, shark, shark, shark, shark, shark, shark, shark.  They love it.  Shark, shark.  Shark, shark, shark.  You're shark, shark.  Shark, sharks.  Shark, sharks.  Shark, sharks.  They're shocking us. 
[01:59:30]  Shark, sharks.  Shark, sharks.  All right.  So people are starting to send in their local news teases and how they scare us with their fear.  Well, here's one from New York, NBC.  And then we got one from Minneapolis, and we'll have more in the coming days.  Coming up at 11, a safety reminder for every parent after a child falls from a fifth-story apartment window.  A deadly flesh-eating bacteria spurs some parents into action at a Bronx school.  And some unwelcome news for New Jersey transit commuters at 11.  All right.  We have a flesh-eating virus. 
[02:00:00]  Your kid can fall out a window.  And your kid can fall out a window.  What's the advice?  What's the safety tip?  And there's something on the subway.  On the subway that they're not telling you until later.  Right.  I think the kid falling out of the window ought to be broadcast in Spanish.  Because, God damn, it always seems to be little Emmanuel fell out of the window.  Safety tips.  How about close the window?  Close the window.  How about watch your kid?  How about you tell us the tips now, because my two-year-old is playing with his blocks right on the windowsill right now as I watch. 
[02:00:30]  Help me out.  Help me out a little bit, please.  I want to hear that again.  Coming up at 11, a safety reminder for every parent after a child falls from a fifth-story apartment window.  A deadly flesh-eating bacteria spurs some parents into action at a Bronx school.  And some unwelcome news for New Jersey transit commuters at 11.  Falling children.  How can they affect you if you're walking to work?  The same that they just did, though, the things that will attract the viewers.  Kid danger, kid danger, work problem.  Right.  It's amazing, because the commuter, we all commute or whatever. 
[02:01:00]  It's their whole lives.  Their children and their jobs.  And that pretty much took care of it all.  When there's no major news report.  You've got to watch.  You've got to watch that.  I'm a commuter, hon.  You sure are.  I have kids and windows.  Hmm.  But we want to go to see Batman.  Well, we can't.  We've got to see what this danger is.  But this is danger.  There's this kind of danger we've got to be aware of.  All right.  We've got the first one coming from out-of-state, Anthony.  Some news station in Minneapolis.  WFTC.  A major backup is filling homes with human waste. 
[02:01:30]  How could it happen?  And could it happen to your house?  Plus, will it cover the 10 o'clock news, UPN 29, next?  Wait, what was that?  Human waste.  It said something is backing up and filling homes with human waste.  Could it happen to you?  Could it happen to you?  And it does every time I put the news on.  Wait, human waste is backing up?  Into a house?  You've got to play that again.  Is it into one house?  I don't know.  A major backup is filling homes with human waste. 
[02:02:00]  How could it happen?  And could it happen to your house?  Plus, will it cover the 10 o'clock news, UPN 29, next?  They said killing?  No.  No.  It's filling.  Oh, filling.  Yeah.  Why would human waste be killing?  That's what I was wondering.  Like it's organizing and unionizing?  We're tired of being treated like, well, you know.  We don't like the S word.  Don't call us the S word.  Well, this is an ongoing bit, so. 
[02:02:30]  I like this one.  I can't wait to hear more from the listeners from all over the country.  Send them in from your town.  That's right.  That's right.  Human waste.  Filling someone's home.  Can it happen to you?  And if so, how much cash will you have to hand her?  Speaking of human waste, where's that really crazy story before we go to break?  Here it is.  Thank you, Eric.  Ooh.  Looks like somebody has rebounded from that UPN debacle.  Eric does a great job every day.  He really does.  Oh, well, hold on. 
[02:03:00]  Young Timothy Hutton hair is pointing.  What happened, Derek?  Boy, Derek, I've never seen that young strapping buck jump up so fast.  That idea came from in here, just to let you know.  What idea?  About segging into that next story.  All right, so I apologize, Eric.  Wow.  And they're all laughing.  No, but I gave you credit.  I thought you rebounded from your UPN failure.  I wasn't going to interrupt and say, oh, yeah, Derek pointed that out while you were talking.  In fairness to stupid, he didn't interrupt. 
[02:03:30]  In fairness to stupid, he didn't interrupt.  There's a whole competition going on behind the scenes.  Oh, and it's fantastic to watch.  Just the way a fucking young lawyer from a Grisham novel jumped up.  That went from this fucking part of the room.  Jesus Christ.  That was from this part of the organization.  Oh, it's funny.  We secretly hate that guy in there.  Jesus.  There are just different worlds on either side of that glass, man.  Oh, boy.  They really...  Oh, boy. 
[02:04:00]  Look at it.  They are rolling in there.  What happened?  You plugged your iPod into the computer?  Eric, what just happened?  Wow, you're panicking.  What's going on?  Oh, he is panicking.  I wasn't even touching it, and DeLette just started playing stuff.  No, stop it.  Hello?  I swear, the gas...  I hit the brake, and the car lunged ahead.  How did it happen?  I killed 50 people on a pier.  Why was I driving on a pier?  I wasn't...  The car went left.  And the gas pedal...  I hit the brake, and the gas went... 
[02:04:30]  Eric, you hit something.  Yes, you did.  Eric, fess up.  I didn't hit three miles at the same time.  You hit something.  What is it, thingy for yourself?  Play tic-tac-toe, so we'll learn.  Shut up, stupid.  You panicked.  Hello, DeLette.  I'll play what I want, Eric.  I'll just play whatever I want, Eric.  Don't turn me off, Eric.  Wow, Hawk.  That was a panic of cataclysmic proportions. 
[02:05:00]  What was the song they were playing?  That's the type of panic that, in the army, kills people.  That's a friendly fire panic.  Or in NASA, it blows a ship up.  Here, you just get your ears blown out a little bit, and a room full of laughter on the other side of the glass.  And to answer your question, what was playing was the pedophilia anthem.  Was that it?  Rock and roll part two.  Rock and roll part two by Gary Glitter.  It looks like a zoo back there, like they're all caged in glass, and the name of that display is really happy white guys. 
[02:05:30]  Yep.  Oh, are they happy?  Pleased as punch.  I clear the phone lines.  No more shark talk.  No more news talk for now.  Oh, mother...  But I had a good...  I'm ripping my wow stickers off my car.  And Danny, don't you dare thank one of these fucking old listener scumbags for calling in.  It's the new people we care about.  That's right.  It's all about the truckers.  And the stupid people from Alabama.  That's right.  We don't need the Pete DeFelices.  Right.  What is this story, Anthony?  This is a cute story. 
[02:06:00]  This is a real go-getter.  A man is facing charges after police say they pulled him from a tank under a woman's toilet that was filled with human waste.  Wait a minute.  Does Jimmy have his paper?  Oh, is it mixed in with my pile here?  I'm sorry.  I'm just trying to follow along.  That's okay, because sometimes you just get scared.  No, you know what it is?  When Anthony's reading and I see you looking down, I get shy.  Right.  We want to read along. 
[02:06:30]  Because I'm afraid to ask.  So apparently this guy was in a portable john.  Is he a perv, obviously?  No.  No, he's an inspector.  No, that's the best place to conduct business.  He's looking for colon cancer.  This guy's dedicated to his perversion.  What a classic.  Eagerly awaiting the arrival of Pat Battle.  Teenage filmmakers stand down there.  But I don't want to.  This is a new pantsuit. 
[02:07:00]  Stand down there, you reporter.  Holy shit.  Wait.  This is the greatest.  Teenager reports seeing man's face in toilet.  It's funny.  So a teenage girl goes there to take a dump or a leak or something.  A leak?  And she looks down and there's a man's face.  She looks down between her legs, probably?  Yeah, deep in the toilet.  What do you like to do?  And here's the beauty.  Police said Gary Moody was under a log cabin outhouse. 
[02:07:30]  How appropriate.  Where was he?  In shit town?  Assholeville, USA.  Albany?  A log cabin.  A log cabin.  He was building a log cabin on his face.  Gary Moody, 45.  She saw Moody's face staring back at her from the hole.  Moody was hosed off before police cuffed him.  All right, wait.  Oh, Moody is a boob.  Yeah, we treated him as if he were hazardous material. 
[02:08:00]  Hikers use the outhouse, I guess.  And police said they don't know how long Moody was in the tank.  But they said the door to it was locked, which means he must have gone in through the toilet.  How do you do that?  Well, you...  There's probably a cleaning area, like maybe a hatch where you would suck the shit out.  And he went in through there.  That is dedication to the female ass. 
[02:08:30]  But, like, wouldn't you think when someone's walking in to not look up?  Hmm.  That is so sick.  Fucking Moody, what happened?  Ever since Clifford Peach beat him up...  Moody!  Leave him alone, Moody!  They're saying he must have gone in through the toilet.  The actual toilet.  Oh, is that what he said?  Well, maybe he was a thinner guy there.  Oh, gone in through...  Like, crawled into the toilet bowl.  Yeah. 
[02:09:00]  Someone's out of houses and stuff.  It's a bigger hole, man.  I hate shitting in those things.  They're awful.  Your shit just falls for ten feet and then you hear, like...  A thud.  A thud.  Not that familiar happy splash.  Right.  When you're at Woodstock 94, we had comedians perform at the little tents.  We had to use outhouses sometimes.  And the shit had piled so high, it was, like, almost to the tippy-top of the bowl.  As an elephant's eye.  Are you kidding?  No, so I'd sit in it and it would, like, hit my cheeks.  Stop it!  No, I'm kidding.  Of course you are.  I would, uh... 
[02:09:30]  There's a fine photo of me eating stew off a plate, hanging outside of an outhouse.  And my friend Michael Donesto was standing with his pants down with his ass cheeks.  I have a great photo.  And people were coming back.  They really thought I was eating shit because I was on the road.  This Moody, can somebody please, can somebody from this office try to get this guy on the phone?  That is dedication.  For the love of God, can we try to get him on the phone?  Police said they don't know how long Moody was in the tank, but they said the door to it was locked,  which means he must have gone in through the toilet.  I don't understand that.  This is the best line.  He lowered himself.  They said they don't know why he was there. 
[02:10:00]  He had to see that ass!  I gotta see the ass.  He just wants to see a girl's ass.  And he's willing to lay in shit and piss.  Standing knee deep in shit, or...  He's gotta be...  Had to be laying down.  You can't stand up in there.  Wait, wait, wait.  At a port-a-potty, you could probably kneel.  You think?  I don't know.  If she saw his face, she was looking up,  you would have to be...  I don't know.  I think he was laying on his back.  You think he's just whacking and puking at the same time? 
[02:10:30]  Puking because of the smell?  And whacking and...  Flies on his face?  Right.  Oh, that is...  That is...  Foul.  When that happens, what they should do,  they should look at him down there and just fire bullets into the toilet.  Yeah.  Get this right.  Pull him out by his ankles, dead.  Or, you know what?  Keep him in there and make all the, you know,  troopers take a big hairy shit one after another.  All right, boy, you like to ask?  Well, here you go.  That's right.  Line him up.  Get some sushi and then send Ben in there. 
[02:11:00]  Hog would be hitting him in the head.  That's a lovely story.  How do you explain to your family when your name winds up in the paper?  Yeah, you're 45 years old.  It's not like a kid with a little prank.  What you were doing in the toilet.  Yeah, you were in the toilet.  The toilet.  How does that come up at Thanksgiving when you sit down and you're sitting with your family?  Oh, remember the time you were caught in the toilet?  All right. 
[02:11:30]  In honor of Marcia calling in, we got...  We're going to...  Someone suggested this, actually.  It's not a bad idea to play the Marcia Brady song from our...  Oh!  The Men in World CD, Anthony.  Right.  How do you...  This guy was laying...  This guy was laying...  Oh, you know what?  It was a woman's toilet, too, so it must have been like some...  Was it a rest area or something?  No, a log cabin.  It wasn't like it could be a men's room or a woman's room.  It was a...  Hikers use it, yes.  It was probably a ladies room.  It's out there on the trail.  Awful berry hiker dump.  Oh.  Just very...  Granola and...  Yeah. 
[02:12:00]  Water.  Filled with twigs.  Dude, we got to...  Oh, we might have a connection.  All right.  Yeah.  We found his number.  Really?  Give the man a call.  All right.  We're working on that.  Give old shit face a call.  Yeah.  We're working on that.  Okay.  Marcia Brady.  Mm-hmm.  Anthony's obsession growing up.  Of course.  Whose wasn't?  Yeah.  At that age.  He put it to words.  Yes.  Well, all I hear all day long at school is how great Marcia did this, or how wonderful 
[02:12:30]  Marcia did that.  Marcia, Marcia, Marcia.  Marcia, Marcia, Marcia.  Marcia.  Marcia.  Marcia.  Looking at the screen, what does this feeling mean?  I got the shiver way down deep in my loins.  Her blonde hair beauty, and who ain't she a cutie?  The best in every club that she joins.  She teases all the fellas, her little sister jealous.  Goddess from her head to her toes. 
[02:13:00]  Well, she wears a grooving skirt with a flowered print shirt.  She's turning heads wherever she goes.  And for the things she does to me.  I, I, I, I, got my very first border watching Marcia Brady on a black and white scene of TV.  Marcia, Marcia, Marcia.  I, I, I, I, I, I, I, got my very first border watching Marcia Brady on a black and white scene of TV. 
[02:13:30]  Marcia, Marcia, Marcia.  Y'all Beachy.  Billboard Junior High, her sparkling blue eyes, a smile anyone to die for.  Well, I almost shot my load at the Hawaiian episode, but mommy started knocking on my door.  She's sweeter than a peach in her bikini on the beach. 
[02:14:00]  The other girls couldn't compare.  Yeah, and what a piece of ass when she took that hula class.  Her skirt so short, I think I saw her hair.  And all the things she does to me, you're in love, virginity.  I, I, I, I, got my very first border watching Marsha Brady on a black and white scene of TV. 
[02:14:30]  Marsha, Marsha, Marsha.  Golly G.  I, I, I, got my very first border watching Marsha Brady on a black and white scene of TV.  Marsha, Marsha, Marsha.  Golly G.  It is a natural impulse to grab and squeeze, squeeze the breasts. 
[02:15:00]  Squeeze the breasts.  No shit.  It's real, real soft.  Almost like pudding.  Almost like pudding.  Yes.  It's a hot piece of ass.  Quite a handful.  Yeah.  The nipples are so sensitive.  Yeah.  That a mere tweak between finger and thumb will give a perfectly good result.  We all be an Anthony show.  In case you didn't nudge.  All right. 
[02:15:30]  We're back on this fine Whip-Em-Out Wednesday.  Wow, wow, wow, wow.  Get your wow stickers.  Wow, wow, wow.  Send in a self-addressed stamped envelope.  The address is up on opiananthony.com.  This works like a charm to all the new listeners out there.  You get wow in your car, whether you make a homemade wow sign or get the official wow bumper 
[02:16:00]  sticker, throw it on your ride.  And there are plenty of women across America that are willing to flash you if they see that  wow.  Right.  All right.  Exactly.  Oh, this guy really bugs me.  This interchange between Steve and this Pete DeFelice.  Oh, what?  Is he writing back?  Steve wrote him, you know, in response, why are you so pissed off?  And he writes back...  Basically, in case you didn't hear the show earlier, it's fine.  This is a guy that really pissed off because we didn't get to his call and we were rude.  Yeah, fan of the show, he says. 
[02:16:30]  Big fan.  And because he was hung up on because one of the guys screening our calls says, oh, we're  moving on.  Click and hangs up.  That's the way it works.  We get too many phone calls to have a nice little conversation and talk you down from  the fact that you didn't make it on the air.  And he was upset and instead of just dealing with it, he says he ripped the wow stickers  off his car, not listening to us, fuck us.  What an asshole.  He claims to be a fan, but it takes something as stupid and as minor as that to also not 
[02:17:00]  be a fan anymore.  And this is a quick little email he sent back to Steve.  Steve was like, dude, why are you so pissed off at us, basically?  I can't get every call...  Because this guy has a radio show, by the way, which I'm sure is a hit.  I can't get every caller on the air, but I don't disrespect my listeners either.  Sometimes calls that are off topic get on because it isn't what's being said.  What?  Because it isn't what is being said as much as it is the fact that a valued listener  is allowed to be a part of the show.  You fucking...  You stupid supermarket commercial. 
[02:17:30]  Hence, the reason no one is listening to your stupid radio show.  You don't get how radio works.  A valued listener.  No one gives the listeners more credit than we do.  We fucking...  How many shows do you know that laugh as hard as listener comments and feedback as this  show?  Genuinely laugh, not phony horseshoe.  And have so many comments.  I appreciate...  Oh, sorry.  We have so many listeners that submit comments through instant feedback, telephone calls,  through stuff they send in, clips, sound clips, song remakes, everything like that. 
[02:18:00]  The listeners are more involved with this show than any other show on the radio.  Guaranteed.  And this guy's pissed off because his call didn't make it through.  Anthony, the experts write about that.  Yes.  How we involve our listeners better than any other show out there.  That's it.  Sometimes calls that are off topic get on because it isn't what is being said as much  as it is the fact that a valued listener is allowed to be a part of the show.  Really?  It's not what's being said?  Do you think when some caller is giving a boring phone call, people are going, well,  you know what? 
[02:18:30]  I'm not going to turn off because a valued listener is talking.  He's a valued listener.  I appreciate that.  Without them, there would be no me.  You fucking melodramatic idiot.  Without them, there would be no me.  Yes, there would be.  You would just be a douche who wasn't emailing us.  Yes, there would be a you, Mr. No Self-Esteem.  I'm going to call Pete a boy pussy.  Wow.  No reason to blow people off or snap just because by the time I called. 
[02:19:00]  No reason to blow people off or snap just because by the time I called,  when your slow screeners picked up the receiver, the topic changed.  Shouldn't put a comma before and, Pete.  Exactly.  And Danny is not a slow phone screener.  That's right.  He's probably the best one we've ever had.  That's right.  He's the best goddamn phone screener from Timbuktu to Portland, Oregon.  And the stupid truckers always call in with shit that doesn't pertain to what's being said.  Where is the line drawn?  Wait a minute.  Whoa, whoa, whoa. 
[02:19:30]  If they're calling you with shit that's not being said,  may I go back to the beginning of your email, Pete?  Sometimes calls that are off topic get on because it isn't what's being said as much as it isn't the fact  that a valued listener is allowed to be a part of the show.  So why two sentences later is it all of a sudden truckers calling you a ship that doesn't pertain to anything?  Why are they not valued listeners that are allowed to be a part of the show and voice their opinion?  Right.  Why are you the only valued listener who is allowed to go off topic, you wandering jizzbucket? 
[02:20:00]  Dude, if that's the way you guys are, I can't change that.  It's sad that you think shitting on your fans is cool.  You know what I'd pay to have people do?  You fucking trying to use reverse psychology moron.  But it isn't when people spend money now to listen to them.  The least that can be done is to let a few random calls get through.  We just didn't like you.  A few random calls.  This whole show, we let random calls through all the time.  Just plunk them down, whatever subject you want to talk about. 
[02:20:30]  All right.  Line two, who's this?  This is Chris.  All right, Chris, what do you have to say today?  I just wanted to piss this guy off and talk about Anthony going to Atlantic City,  which you guys were talking about about two hours ago,  because I'm going to be in Atlantic City this weekend, too.  Hey, how about that?  It's completely off topic, but hey, what the hell?  That's boring.  You're a valued listener.  Valued listener.  That's right.  Corinne from Jersey.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I love you.  Thank you.  I just wanted to say that I've been listening since before XM, 
[02:21:00]  and I've tried to call before and been hung up on,  and I'm a girl, and I'm less of a crybaby than this guy.  Well, his name is Pete DeFelice.  I don't know what his radio show is.  Pete, you want to call back and let us know?  We don't know what it is.  Steve will email him.  Let's find out what kind of radio show he does.  I'm sure it's good.  Jim in Philly, what's up?  Your screener is awful.  He's hung up on me about 50 million times.  I can remember times when he's fucking cursed at me. 
[02:21:30]  Anthony, people never want to take the blame.  They never want to think, perhaps I was hung up on because I had a shitty subject.  I couldn't deliver the subject properly.  They always think it's the screener's fault.  Once again, we cannot be polite.  No.  We have to move forward all the time.  And it's not even about the radio show.  It's about the fact that people in this room are fancy and important.  You're not.  If you need to be cuddled, because we're not going to go to your call,  then this is not the show for you. 
[02:22:00]  Mm-hmm, that's right.  We have to move on.  We hang up on people all morning long because we have no choice.  Deal with it.  We have to get to certain calls and stuff.  I did Google his name.  What did it come up with?  Nothing.  Oh.  Nothing at all.  Is that a real radio show?  If you just talk in your basement and then listen to yourself later?  You can't be on the radio.  He's probably a podcaster.  If no one's listening to your show.  We have a clip of his show?  Mom!  I love the Lord!  I have to do this now! 
[02:22:30]  Mom!  Please stop calling me!  You got me.  And I was like, oh.  Well, we got a nude man in a ski mask in the Hamptons.  Ooh.  Hamptons sex fiend.  Sex fiend.  This guy is sick on so many levels.  Yesterday's attack on a 61-year-old woman.  61.  Jesus.  Walking the beach outside the Maidstone Club led police to scour the area with canine dogs. 
[02:23:00]  The would-be rapist was chased off by a good Samaritan.  The problem is the guy is a nude man in a ski mask.  And he's running up to-  Naked, just wearing a ski mask.  Running up to old ladies.  That's how you do that, man.  Attempting to rape them.  Ooh.  A naked maniac wearing only a ski mask tried to rape a 61-year-old woman yesterday.  Naked man-  You just picture-  Ah!  The guy with his arms waving.  Ooh, ooh, ooh.  His junk flapping around.  A 61-year-old woman yesterday as she took a morning walk along a beach in front of one 
[02:23:30]  of the most exclusive country clubs in the Hamptons.  One of those nice walks that you see in, like, pharmaceutical commercials.  It's just some old woman walking on the beach, barefoot, with a little dress blowing, maybe  a big floppy hat on, looking around, ready to talk about her arthritis medicine.  Or adult diapers.  Or adult diapers.  And here comes this fucking lunatic, naked with a ski mask on.  From the dunes. 
[02:24:00]  Oh.  Just gonna pull her huggies down and brutally assault her.  Her huggies.  The savage crime in East Hampton.  The padded ass on that pat battle ass.  Sparked a massive manhunt for the sex fiend who disappeared on foot after spotting a bystander  during the attack.  Mmm.  Cops said the unidentified woman was strolling along the public ocean beach in front of  the Maidstone Club in the morning when the perpetrator caught her.  Yeah.  The man, described as six feet tall with a medium to dark complexion, emerged from sand dunes 
[02:24:30]  and accosted the woman, police said.  They won't even say he's black.  No, they just say, and I'm sure she, you know, she could tell.  They could probably just tell by the footprints if there's a, something that looks like a T-Rex  tail was dragging between the footprints.  Or, I don't know, I was going the other way.  Oh, okay.  Anthony, I got to, I thought you meant the two, uh.  I got to interrupt the comedic stylings of Jim Norton. 
[02:25:00]  Oh, what do we got?  And Anthony Coomey, uh, because a valued listener is calling in.  Valued listener.  So we don't want him just sitting there because he's a valued listener.  Point Ope, random caller.  What do you have today?  Hey, I just wanted to talk about Bob Apodaca again.  Dad, used to pitch for the Mets.  Doc, you made me laugh like crazy for a couple days just bringing that name up the other day.  Just wanted to call back on that, guys.  Have a great one.  Punch it out.  You're a valued listener, sir.  Thanks for tuning in.  Thank you, valued listener.  Wow. 
[02:25:30]  All right.  And Danny, thank him.  And thank them for calling when they call in.  Right.  Be nice.  Get their addresses.  We'll send them a little something.  He threw the victim to the ground and roughed her up, then ran off after spotting a man  who came to the woman's aid.  The passerby called an ambulance and police for the woman.  We're calling an ambulance.  She was treated for minor injuries and released.  You're kidding.  I was almost raped on the beach by a doggy.  Where?  Where?  Where?  The Hamptons. 
[02:26:00]  You're kidding me.  Oh, God love them.  The lunatic with his junk.  It was so big.  I was just talking to it.  Go away.  All right.  Well, they're looking for the guy.  Oh, Pat.  Pat Battle.  I want to see Pat Battle wearing, like, shorts. 
[02:26:30]  Ooh.  Like, cut-off denim shorts.  Yeah.  Maybe a sleeveless tank top.  Ah, nice.  Doing a beach story.  That's right.  Oh, wow.  There's a couple other good things here.  Yeah.  A Maidstone club manager, when asked about yesterday's assault, declined to say if the  victim was a member of the club.  My God.  The old woman.  The golf, tennis, and beach club is known for its former practice of barring blacks, Jews,  and other minorities.  Ah, the good old days. 
[02:27:00]  The olden days.  How long ago was that?  Uh, Thursday.  Well, I can't imagine why they'd want to bar people, considering they just want to run over  naked with a ski mask and rape you behind a sand dune.  That awful policy.  And everyone's surprised, because it's so exclusive.  Yeah, it's very exclusive.  But a 63-year-old resident, a man said, ruefully, this is, this is, place is changing. 
[02:27:30]  This is, place is changing.  I swear to God, that's how it's written in the paper.  You know what that means, don't you?  This is, place is changing.  This is, place is changing.  To be honest, nothing really surprises me anymore.  Yeah.  You know what he means by that.  Yep.  A bad element is moving into town.  Remember the good old days at this club?  Wow.  Look how long ago that was, though.  Hmm.  Exclusive.  Do you know that voice you just did, like that, like the rich guy voice? 
[02:28:00]  No, no, no.  When I first started comedy, I was, oh, this is embarrassing.  I found this recently.  I wrote a joke.  Yeah.  This is atrocious.  Liddy would vomit at this.  And I was saying, like, how I was doing, like, the snobby people in Connecticut.  Yeah.  And I said, they're so snobby that they don't eat chunky monkey.  They eat obese primates.  Look.  I just got goosebumps.  Shame.  Shame. 
[02:28:30]  Shame.  Shame on you.  Wow.  That's still my favorite.  But I would even do that voice, like that kind of a, that was my Connecticut rich voice.  Yeah, it's a chunky monkey.  That's the thing.  Hearing that joke, it's the type of feeling you get if you walked in and saw, like, your 
[02:29:00]  friend blowing a guy.  You have to just close the door quick.  Like, that embarrassed, like, eh.  Wow.  Hey, Matt on Long Island wants in on this story.  Matt, go ahead.  Yo, the guy in the ski mask in the Hamptons, the new guy, it's Stern.  It's confirmed.  Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo.  I invented rape, Robin.  Tell him, Fred.  Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo.  Tell him, Fred.  We were raping girls naked on the beach years ago.  I'd worn nothing but a bandana around my head.  Ha-ha-ha. 
[02:29:30]  Tell him, Fred.  Oh, this is funny, too.  Craig from Tennessee.  Craig?  Yeah.  Go ahead.  Hey, man, the little lady out right, they had to give her UPS.  I thought he had to give her UPS.  I seen the cops knocking the truck window out, and I thought they was giving the man UPS.  I thought the man was dead.  That's the way it was.  Giving him UPS.  Holy ignoramus.  Where do they find such a dumb human being? 
[02:30:00]  I have no idea.  The thing that gets me, she didn't bat an eye.  No.  She said it like, it wasn't like giving him UPS, like she didn't know.  Like, she knows it as UPS.  That's right.  I've seen the cops knocking the truck window out, and I thought they was giving the man UPS.  I thought the man was dead.  That's the way it was.  Anthony, I was just handed audio.  Oh.  Of the victim.  Really?  The 61-year-old woman, yes.  Oh, wow. 
[02:30:30]  This is an exclusive for the Opie and Anthony Piper.  Let's see what she has to say.  For many days, I didn't bring him here, because I suffer when he bites me.  He bites me in my vagina.  When I'm walking, and he sees other dog, he's right away.  He jumps on my vagina, because he gets so crazy.  He doesn't know who I am.  He forgets everything, and he bites the Labrador and his penis.  I don't want him to bite my Labrador and his penis.  My Labrador is a baby.  It's beautiful. 
[02:31:00]  Oh, this is a sick F.  Oh.  That's a clip, man.  Look, in my vagina, two times he bites me.  But his penis are very small, and they don't damage very much.  They just, they pinch.  They pinch.  And those beaches will stay open.  I want that pervert hung up by his big black junk.  I don't want to open them up and have those food stamps spill out all over the dog. 
[02:31:30]  Very good.  Wait for the news to get a hold of this one.  Going to need a bigger condom.  Is there a nude rapist running around in your neighborhood?  Could, everywhere but Utah, could this happen to you?  Pete DeFelice was a jock on the Montclair College Station, WMSC. 
[02:32:00]  You college radio guys, you know, it's cute.  But you really have to separate yourself from real radio.  You're not in radio yet.  You're not in radio yet.  You're learning to do radio.  Someday you may advance and do radio.  College radio, not real radio.  Sorry.  You're in school.  If I get a few calls, maybe it has four or five people calling. 
[02:32:30]  It's like if you're going to school to become an accountant.  You're in math class.  You're not an accountant yet.  You're just in math class.  That's right.  You're in radio class.  That's all.  Stop it.  These college radio guys calling up, well, I do a radio show.  No, you don't.  You're in a classroom.  You're in a goddamn classroom.  Let me show you how different it is.  Yeah.  One day I'll get brave enough to bring in some of my college radio shows.  Oh, please.  Bobby, please bring those in.  Oh, my God. 
[02:33:00]  I have to.  Do we need special earphones or is it like a dog whistle where you can't quite hear your high voice?  This guy thinks he's doing what we're doing well.  I'm one of the guys doing this show, and I'll show you what I was doing in college radio.  Please bring that in.  And it's a lot different.  You broadcast on walkie-talkie band to the dorm.  Stop it.  Dude, there's nothing that you're doing in college radio that's more humiliating than obese primate.  Please bring that in.  Please bring that in.  Obese primate.  All right.  I'll bring it in.  It is God-awful.  I do a radio show. 
[02:33:30]  I will.  Yeah, I'll have to crawl.  You know what?  I might have to move the microphone under the console.  I don't even think I'd be able to look at you guys.  It is kind of weird, though, when you have something play.  I've had old Seth play.  When people are trashed, it's like, ugh.  Yeah.  It's embarrassing on a really weird level.  Dude, we started playing our first show at WBAB, Anthony and I, his first show that we did together,  and we only made it two minutes so far.  And that was not even.  Not that bad, man.  No.  That really wasn't that bad.  It was horrific.  No, it wasn't.  I love your little chipper.  I like Chipper, Anthony.  Shut up.  Do not.  WBAB chip show. 
[02:34:00]  Chipper.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, I know.  Stop it.  But it wasn't even that bad.  I mean, you were just happy to be on the air.  Wait for my chunky monkey line.  Shut up, chunky monkey.  I told you, I'll be primate.  Primate.  This guy.  In my radio show.  Stop it.  You have to be cordial to your listeners.  They sit next to you in poli-sci.  This guy's a jackass.  You don't do a radio show.  I know you're on a great rant, Anthony, but a valued listener. 
[02:34:30]  Oh, please, please.  Valued listener coming up.  Put him on.  Let's take lessons from college radio people.  And he's calling from Mecca, better known as Utah.  John.  Yeah, I'm a valued listener.  I just wanted to say, I like toast.  Punch it out.  Do you like a darker light?  I was asking him a pertinent question.  Thank God we got to that valued listener.  I'm trying to make something of that call.  It's not so much what's being said as much as it is that a valued listener is brought to the radio program. 
[02:35:00]  Because the listeners aren't going, wow, that guy's call sucked.  It's just about him liking toast.  The listener's going, you know, that's really nice of them that they let this guy through.  And I hope they treat all their callers like this.  I'll bet one listener is beeping and another listener in another vehicle going,  and look, the CPR guy just dropped off the boxes here.  That's good, Ed.  FedEx.  I like how you tied that all in.  Thank you.  I do that.  It was brilliant.  Tom, the trucker, what's up?  Tom. 
[02:35:30]  Yeah, Tom?  Yeah, this is Kyle.  Oh, hi, Kyle.  Hi, Kyle.  Our rude phone screener.  I got a message for this Pete asshole.  If you have such a problem with truckers,  how about I come up to Montclair and kick his ass right out there,  take an IQ test and kick his ass in that?  Punching out.  That's right, all you dumb truckers.  We love the truckers.  All you dumb truckers.  That's what he was saying.  He said that they're dumb.  They call up with stoop.  What did he say about the truckers?  That they're, uh...  I don't know.  That's good.  You know, every product that you buy with your dollars has spent time on a truck. 
[02:36:00]  75% of commerce would stop in this country if trucks did not exist.  That's how important the truck driver is to our great nation.  That's right.  And without truckers, by the way, incidentally, we would all be able to drive comfortably on snow  without some fucking animal doing 65 right behind you.  You cocksuckers.  Could you understand that we're terrified in the shitty weather?  Please.  God, you make a great fly, man.  Nothing but that grill with that bulldog staring you in the face in the rear view mirror. 
[02:36:30]  Those fuckers barreling down on you.  You're in pea soup.  You can't see shit in front of you.  Sorry, we don't all have 80 tons fucking gluing us to the ground.  Shitheads.  They are fearless, these guys.  They will drive by.  You know how you drive by a truck?  You don't want to hydroplane and slide into them.  These fucking animals.  There's a truck on my right.  I'm in the left lane, and a guy is right behind me.  So I have to speed up and go past the truck, and I know I'm in a hydroplane and die.  Could you have some mercy, you fucks? 
[02:37:00]  I love when they're in from the back of your bumper.  Dude, I was coming home to the night.  I'm driving.  It was perfect weather, and I got the trucker on the right where the trailer is swaying.  It's probably an empty trailer.  I guarantee they fuck with us on purpose, though.  On purpose, because cars cut them off and treat them awful.  But, boy, when the inclement weather comes, it's payback time for anyone.  They're on their CB radios with each other.  Look what I'm going to do to this asshole.  Here's a move that I can't stand what the truck is doing.  This happened to me driving back from, I can't remember where it was. 
[02:37:30]  Moncler?  Yeah, Moncler.  Maybe it was Cleveland.  There was a huge traffic jam because of some accident or whatever the hell it was.  So traffic's backed up to the point where it's just stopping.  It's stopped.  I cannot be bothered.  I will drive on any part of the road to get past the traffic jam.  I am taking the chance that there's going to be an officer somewhere seeing me make these illegal moves and pull me over.  That's the chance I take.  So I get on the shoulder.  Now, I'm not talking the right shoulder. 
[02:38:00]  I'm talking the left shoulder of the road.  And I'm buzzing past all the traffic, just waiting to get up as far as I can.  The trucks will pull into the non-lane, the shoulder, to stop me from going around them.  And I say, no.  Now, let me tell you something.  Because I hate when people do that.  Hold the phone.  Let me tell you something.  If there's a line of cars doing that, that's bad.  And because when you finally do get to the jam, all these cars got to come in and it hurts traffic. 
[02:38:30]  I was the only guy doing this because it's one of those moves where you're driving over gravel, glass.  You have to cut in and drive on grass because sometimes the shoulder disappears.  It's really a stunt drive.  Well, you want all the guys that were stuck in that traffic jam to sympathize with you.  No, not sympathize, but leave me the fuck alone and let me do what I'm going to do.  If I get pulled over, that's my problem.  You stopping me isn't helping you any.  Dude, I'm one of the guys that moves over just a bit.  Nope.  I'm one of those guys. 
[02:39:00]  Nope.  If it's a line of people using an entrance ramp, that's a problem.  I understand that.  Until it's my turn and I'll try to say move, trust me.  But if it's not me, it's all about you.  It is really all about you, douchebag.  So if it's someone else trying to do that move, I'll just fade over to the left a little bit.  I actually got to side with the truckers on that one.  Nope.  I have to.  Get out of my way.  I'm taking the chance.  I'm risking the ticket here.  You know what it is?  I think if there was a way for you to go around the accident, this is my logic,  if there was a way to go around the accident where you would never have to merge back into traffic, 
[02:39:30]  they probably wouldn't care.  But the bottom line is if a bunch of people do that, then traffic just gets fucked up worse.  No.  You know what I do also?  When I go to cut in, I don't stop and wait.  And look, it's a very timed out thing.  Yeah, of course.  I'll wait until traffic starts moving a little and some idiot isn't right on the gas pedal  and leaves an opening.  And I dart right in there and I don't interrupt with anyone's traffic.  Again, it's not a line of cars that are doing this.  It's me and anyone else who wants to take the chance of fucking up their vehicle or getting a ticket 
[02:40:00]  or driving off a bridge because the shoulder disappears at the bridge.  And if you want to do that, fine.  Why cut in my way?  And by the way, the truck did this.  He pulled into the lane.  I went on the grass and went around him anyway and flipped on the bird as I went by.  Go fuck yourself.  I'm getting past this.  You could sit in this traffic now.  I got a side with Jerry Reed and the boys on this one.  That's right.  Let's go to Joe the trucker.  Joe?  About two hours ahead of schedule.  Yeah.  Hold on to your ass, Fred. 
[02:40:30]  Joe?  Yeah.  Hi, guys.  How you doing?  Good.  Hey, I just want to say a big fuck you to all these self-involved pricks  who think your fucking show is all about them.  You know, you're out here to shit on people, and that's what makes you guys so fucking great,  and that's the reason I listen.  Thank you.  All right.  So, and to the asshole that likes to pull over on the shoulders,  hey, fuck you.  You get in my damn way, I'll run your throat.  All right.  Thank you, Joe.  I wasn't in, yeah.  I don't like when they pull in my way like that.  All right.  We got to reboot the phones they're saying. 
[02:41:00]  This is a good.  Oh, no.  Good place to take a break.  Okay.  What happened to the phones?  They got scared.  Oh, me.  You don't understand when the phones go out.  I get really nervous.  I want to take that bit from you so bad.  No.  I guess it's so funny.  But if you do, I'll...  They got scared.  I got scared.  Hawk?  All right.  We're going to do the Jim Norton pop culture quiz.  Yeah.  Come on.  I don't want to take quiz.  He's going to study or cheat or something.  And we got some Arubo audio.  No, it's starting to get interesting over there finally, right? 
[02:41:30]  What does it sound like?  A scream and glub, glub, glub?  Boy, I'm losing that battle.  Of course you are.  I'm losing that pat.  And reporting for the side of the Empire State Building.  And you're not going to believe what type of cosmetic surgery is getting really popular.  No?  Cosmetic surgery? 
[02:42:00]  What did I do?  Was something wrong?  Oh, no, no.  Not you.  No.  I'm just trying to talk.  A little Jimmy.  A little cracks.  Holy shit.  Labia, labia, plasty.  Can we stop?  Please tell me it's not labia reduction because I'll spit.  T'was beauty killed the battle.  Vaginoplasty?  Hymenoplasty?  Oh.  That labia reduction makes me sick to my stomach that women would wreck such beautiful vagins like that. 
[02:42:30]  Jimmy likes them big.  Big and swollen.  You dumb women.  Stop believing the bullshit the idiot you're dating or married to is telling you.  If he doesn't appreciate that, dump him.  Because he's stupid.  Why would you want to take some of the petals off the rose?  That is a nice way to put it.  That is a sick way to put it.  That's a very nice way to put it.  Thank you.  All right.  We'll break and we'll do all that.  Hopefully.  Well, that's the thing we wanted.  It's the audio we wanted.  We got the audio.  Oh, we do?  Yeah, we're going to do that next, too.  So, Derek, get us out of here.  Boots always bring this show to a hall. 
[02:43:00]  Oh, screeching hall.  And I'm playing it.  Whip them out Wednesday.  Yeah.  Whip them out Wednesday.  Whip them out Wednesday.  Whip them out Wednesday.  Oh, this fat hat.  This hat is beautiful.  Whip them out Wednesday.  Yeah.  Whip them out Wednesday.  Yeah.  Those are real.  Wow, that's good.  How about the woman that said she'd shut off?  Ah, yeah.  Sexy girls.  Sex, sexy girls.  You have size? 
[02:43:30]  Wow.  Girls show boobs.  Boo.  Dicey boobs.  Yes.  You just got wowed.  Wow.  Hey.  That was amazing.  That's nice.  We'll be an Anthony.  Hey, yeah.  Yeah.  It's world-renowned.  It's Whip them out Wednesday.  What?  It's Whip them out Wednesday.  Yeah.  Whip them out Wednesday.  Those are real.  Cancel your appointment.  Oh, yeah.  It's Whip them out Wednesday.  It's Whip them out Wednesday.  Yeah.  Whip them out Wednesday. 
[02:44:00]  Huh?  Uh-huh.  Oh, wow.  You can have a Nisha.  XM 202.  Na-na-na-na-boo.  Na-na-na-na-boo.  Na-na-na-na-boo.  Na-na-na-na-boo.  Na-na-na-na-na-boo.  Let's go to John the Trucker.  Na-na-na-na.  John the Trucker, what's up? 
[02:44:30]  Hey, how's what's going on?  I'm not hearing all this ridiculous effort.  Nobody knows how to drive right Chicago.  But I think we ought to have all these girls calling in on Whippin' Night Wednesday  about the contest of What's in My Pants  and get some more girls in the studio to come in and do the cherry throwing at the asshole.  Oh, yeah, we've got to do cherry darts again.  You're 100% right.  All right, and maybe we've got to...  I've got a buddy of mine that I've got on getting XM, 
[02:45:00]  and he's been waiting for too much to hear women contests,  and I've been telling him, no, you don't want to not subscribe anymore.  I said, just keep hanging in there, you'll hear it.  Who's this, your buddy you're talking about?  Yeah.  How long you know him?  Oh, my God, Jim, don't.  Thank you, John.  Thank you.  We have learned that the Truckers like to talk a little longer than the average listener.  Well, I will play a round of Guess What's in My Pants today.  What the hell?  All right, we need a lady.  Well, because it's going to tie into this fine story we're about to do here that's in the local newspaper, Anthony. 
[02:45:30]  Where?  The Daily News.  Opie, where?  I've got to play along, and I don't have my sheet.  I hate being confused.  It's this one, Over the Top.  Oh.  Over the Top?  Oh, I got it.  Over the Top.  By the way, just a reminder, because it is Whip Them Out Wednesday, Wow Stickers, blah,  blah, blah.  If you want one, you send in a self-addressed stamped envelope.  The address is up on opianthony.com.  But, Friday, we've got the lovely ladies from Delilah's. 
[02:46:00]  Delilah's.  Strip Club in Philly.  They're coming up on Friday to just pretty much walk all over, all around Manhattan to  hand out Wow Stickers, because we've got to really start marketing this show.  And I guess we're going to invite some listeners to walk around with ladies, and hopefully some  hot listeners to walk around with the ladies as well, the hot women listeners out there.  So, if you want to join us for the walk around on Friday, just show up at the station around  the, I don't know, just before 7.  Okay?  Right.  This is going to bug me, this article.  This one? 
[02:46:30]  God damn it.  It's cute.  This is an atrocity to Jimmy.  It sickens me.  We have a guy that, his girlfriend had some of this done.  Jimmy, stay there.  We're going to get to you.  So, it has come to this.  In our world of extreme makeovers, facelifts, and fat suctioning are no longer enough.  I missed that one up.  Try it again.  Holy crap, where did I go wrong?  Comma or the end?  Let's try that again. 
[02:47:00]  So, it has come to this.  In our world of extreme makeovers, facelifts, and fat...  Oh, what?  You read makeovers, facelifts, and fat suctioning as a list.  Here's the problem.  They wrote it wrong.  After makeovers, it should have been a semicolon.  Thank you, Jimmy, for helping me out.  Semicolon.  Thank you.  So, it should read this way.  In our world of extreme makeovers, facelifts, and fat suctioning are no longer enough.  Nailed it, right?  I think that was it.  Thank you.  In our world of extreme makeovers...  Maybe the comment is correct, actually. 
[02:47:30]  ...are no longer enough.  I don't know about that.  That's a tricky one, though, because it looks like a list.  Makeovers, facelifts, and fat suctioning are no longer enough.  Are no longer enough.  Right.  There should be a semicolon there.  It does seem like, in our world of extreme makeovers, facelifts and fat suctioning...  Right.  ...are no longer enough.  It is weird.  It's written a little odd.  It's very oddly written, and she should be shot for it.  All right.  The latest thing in cosmetic...  By Pat Battle.  The latest thing in cosmetic surgery is centering on something more intimate.  Women's genitals.  Yes, women's genitals. 
[02:48:00]  Or genitals, as I like to call them.  Wow.  I like to finger her genitals.  The marketing pitch, delivered mainly via the internet, tells women they can look younger,  feel prettier, and have better sex if they'll just fix the most private part of their body.  Fix that snatch.  Will you dummies stop listening to this type of advice?  Mm-hmm.  Please, ladies, stop.  They all want to be young and feel good about how they look and be more self-confident, 
[02:48:30]  says Dr. Bernard Stern.  Dr. Stern.  Hoo-hoo-hoo.  Tell him, Fred.  I invented chopping women's vaginas down to size.  I've been tightening vagis for years.  Tell him, Fred.  Woman sees me, our vag tightens up.  Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo.  Sees my bank account.  It opens wide, though.  Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo.  Robin.  Ha-ha.  Dr. Stern.  Tell him, Fred.  Oh, come here, honey.  Your pussy needs a trim.  Hoo-hoo-hoo. 
[02:49:00]  I thought that said tied.  Some say they're...  They've tied.  No.  Some say they're tired of not feeling anything.  Oh.  Hmm.  Oh, I see what's going on here.  Then you stitch it up and it feels better?  Okay.  Uh...  Why don't you continue, Anthony?  Where were you?  Yeah.  I hope...  The hope of a better sex life?  Yeah.  Brought Gene Johnson, a 38-year-old mother or two, to Stern's office last June.  Hoo-hoo-hoo. 
[02:49:30]  I wanted to feel more sensation, says Johnson, who had a...  Johnson.  That should be a period.  Who had a vaginoplasty in which the vaginal tissue is stitched tighter.  Oh, I've heard of women having these, um...  They have these after they have a baby.  Yeah, that's different.  Internally, like that, for a better feeling and more sensation, is a little bit different,  because she probably wanted them to stop missing the walls.  It was like somebody on socks sliding into, like, a brand-new empty bedroom. 
[02:50:00]  Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.  Cha-cha-cha-cha-cha.  Nothing.  That's my wood?  Okay.  Terrific.  I wanted to feel more confident, like it was worth it for my husband and me.  What confidence?  You feel better about yourself?  Do you think so?  I know that's the answer.  My pussy's tight.  It was her idea, she says, but after consulting with Stern, 
[02:50:30]  she had another procedure done at the same time.  A labia plastic.  Nice.  In which the labia are reduced and reshaped during the three-month healing.  Three months.  Wow.  Johnson had moments when she thought, oh, my gosh, I shouldn't have done this.  But she reports that her sex life is better.  Having the internal tightening because you had a kid is one thing.  But this labia reduction, it makes me...  How stupid are you that you don't know how sexy that is? 
[02:51:00]  How dumb is the guy you're dating that he tells you you should have that reduced?  Everyone has different tastes, Jim.  That's right.  Some people don't like the big one.  Well, you know what?  I like a vagina.  It should look like a fist wearing a roast beef wig.  That's a horrible image you conjure up.  That's what I wanted.  Like, when you have panties on, you want it to look like...  You ever see the end of the sequel to Silence of the Lambs 
[02:51:30]  where the top of Ray Liotta's head is ripped off?  Yes.  The way it would look like if there was just a big brain bulge sticking out.  That's what I want.  A big, fat lump.  Well, that was the stupidest scene in movie history.  Oh, it's horrendous.  It was so fake.  It was hilarious.  Then you'll be happy to know that these procedures could also open the door to medical complications  or permanent damage.  Too much tightening in a vaginoplasty can result in painful intercourse, he says. 
[02:52:00]  Nerve damage can diminish sensation.  Labioplasty brings a risk of nerve damage, too.  While a botched job can create holes in the labia or eliminate them entirely.  Wow, that's got to look a little odd.  Yeah, like an alien's ear.  That's what you want to stick your dick in.  Paul Anka checking in, Anthony.  I'm sorry.  Oh, Paul Anka.  Yes, Paul.  Valued callers get on the air.  I don't give a shit about anything else. 
[02:52:30]  Right idea.  People really want to go with that.  Soft delivery.  People want to go with that Paul Anka.  They're really feeling it, but they can't pull it off.  They want to go with it.  It takes a lot more than just calling and saying, you know, this gets this.  You need a strong delivery.  You kind of need a Paul Anka kind of impression.  The band gets shirts.  Right.  The band gets shirts.  Valued listeners get on the air.  Valued listeners get on the air.  You've got to also say it twice.  Get on the air.  Yeah. 
[02:53:00]  Yeah.  There you go.  This guy called up.  Valued listeners get on the air.  Oh, speaking of which, Anthony, you know, we're in the middle of a great story, but another  valued listener.  So let's go to a valued listener.  Yes, sir.  Yeah.  When I grew up, we always called little black children negligence.  Oh, Jesus.  Why do people insist on doing that?  I don't know.  Boston or Alabama or one of 40 states I could have been.  Where are you from?  We're doomed as a nation.  That's the problem when you go to the valued listeners. 
[02:53:30]  You don't know what they're going to talk about.  Well, maybe you know this.  We don't do it like the old Pete DeFelice does.  All right.  Where else are we?  Botched.  Yeah.  Botched job.  Can create holes.  Anything else in this article?  They talk about the psychological implications, but who cares about that?  Some women who have had labiaplasty say it's as much for comfort or hygiene as beauty.  Can I back up?  Because it's just a funny line.  Because I love how these people just write shit.  Yeah.  There's nothing new about vaginal tightening except a fresh marketing approach. 
[02:54:00]  It's all about the marketing.  We want to put tightened vaginas right in your face.  I love how they have to use the word fresh marketing.  Fresh.  How do you market vaginal tightening?  Well, Jimmy, now you're not going to like this.  I'm sure I won't.  You like the big labia, and it says,  In some cases, large labia can create hygiene problems or affect sexual function.  Now, here's the hygiene problems they're talking about, these rookies.  That when she tinkles, sometimes a little tinkle gets caught up in there and stays. 
[02:54:30]  Yeah.  And let me tell you, that makes for a lovely aroma.  A lovely, wafting aroma.  You are something else, my friend.  And he's not even making a joke.  You like it a little dirty.  No.  No, because that's called dirty.  No, no, no.  It's not like she's picking up a steal with it.  If it gets dirty, it's because of whiz.  No, there's a dirty sweat that's unhygienic.  There is a difference between being a slight musk that is just a natural thing and being dirty. 
[02:55:00]  There's a dirty smell, and there's a sexy smell.  Believe me, I don't like dirty.  I don't like a filthy, awful pussy.  If they're getting caught in the labia, though.  Tinkle?  When tinkle gets trapped in there?  For how long, would you say?  Maybe a week.  A week?  No, you know, just from that morning.  I would always tell girlfriends who I was dating, do not shower right before you come  over.  I don't want to talk to you.  See, because you like it a little dirty.  Shower that day, though.  That's considered a little dirty.  Shower that day.  I don't like a girl to go three days without a shower.  I can't do that.  No.  Just that day.  Shower in the morning, go to work, and then come over and, you know. 
[02:55:30]  You like that.  Yeah, but you've got to shower that morning.  I'm not that earthy.  What do you have, Hope?  Speaking of earthy.  They also can get it caught in undergarments and make it difficult to wear tight pants  or tiny bikinis.  Right.  Tiny bikinis.  Oh, I love it.  The loose knuckle, or if you've seen the camel toe, or sometimes the bikini just gets caught  up in there and it comes out the side.  I fucking salivate for that. 
[02:56:00]  And by the way, what does it get caught in clothes?  What are you, what are you constantly in buildings that are on fire at three o'clock in the morning?  How fast do you have to get dressed?  If you're zipping your labia up, perhaps you do need this procedure.  Perhaps you need to email yellowtreats at AOL.com.  You have a dinner coming, sweetie.  That's great.  Oh.  Oh, well, we've got an example of us.  Now the story gets sexy, Opie.  Yeah, it sure does.  Diana Baker, 60, had a labiaplasty and a vaginoplasty recently. 
[02:56:30]  Vagino.  Vaginoplasty?  Vaginoplasty.  Vaginoplasty.  I'm thinking vaginoplasty.  You're kidding!  But the reason has nothing to do with sex.  Uh-oh.  Ugh!  She delivered three children vaginally.  And this is a quote from her.  And that tears you up.  For years, she wanted to have her vagina tightened and her labia trimmed, especially since riding 
[02:57:00]  a bike in gym shorts is uncomfortable.  Oh!  Feels like she's sitting on two ham hocks.  Trying to pedal that bike.  Well, they didn't highlight it, but keep reading.  It gets good.  But doctors just brushed me off, she said, until she found Stern on the internet.  Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!  Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!  I'll trim you up, honey.  Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! 
[02:57:30]  Two weeks after the procedure, it's too soon to tell if the surgeries are effective.  I'll reserve judgment, she says, but I'm hopeful.  Two weeks after, she's still regretting this, if you ask me.  For centuries, it seems, they've been trying to change themselves, often with disastrous results.  In Inventing Beauty, this woman writes about mascara that blinded and hair removal creams  that poisoned in the 20s and 30s.  Ah, the good old days. 
[02:58:00]  That's it.  Keep messing with your vaginas, stupid asses.  You got a nice, fat, thick one, and you mess with it.  Boo.  Boo.  But what sets the more extreme procedures apart from, say, hair dying or teeth whitening  is the increased risk.  You can have a bad outcome or nerve damage or even die.  I don't think women having this done are in touch with that anymore.  If that lady's doing it because it was genuinely uncomfortable because she had kids, again, that's different. 
[02:58:30]  But the women that do it because some jack-off they dated went, ew, you're pretty...  I had a lot of girls with big ones, fat ones, and I was always so self-conscious because some guy said something.  I'm like, what dummy was this?  Let me find him so I can set the entrance to his home on fire.  He almost wrecked this for me.  The girls get tight cunts!  Wow.  Geez, Paul.  Sorry.  Because these surgeries are cosmetic.  A little over the top. 
[02:59:00]  Wow.  Good thing you hold back on the C word.  Not only do you say it, but you pound your fist.  I was just trying out my Pauline.  It was a good one.  I thought it was him.  Insurance doesn't cover the cost.  It shouldn't!  Labioplasty runs from four Gs to about six grand.  Vaginoplasty can run $5,500.  For the two together, you're talking about eight grand.  Hymenoplasty?  Is that when they replace the hymen?  Why would they want to do that?  Some girls like getting their virginity back. 
[02:59:30]  Say it was taken by an uncle or a dear old dad.  Yeah, or a bike seat.  They're not going to give it back.  Taken by a pothole.  Oh, my God.  Are you done?  What?  The phones are hilarious.  Yeah.  I'm done with this story.  Listen to Gary in El Paso.  Gary?  Hey, man.  Isn't that kind of like rolling your odometer back in a car?  You think you're getting some low mileage?  But I try to leave you stranded in the middle of the desert.  Well, there you go.  All right, man.  Very good.  Good point.  Let's go to Brad. 
[03:00:00]  Hello.  Go ahead, Brad.  Hey.  Hey, how you doing?  Hey.  Hey, just made a comment there.  That surgery is good for all those guys there, so he can follow Ben Sparks after he hammers  them out.  Wow.  It looks so much better on the foot.  It looks promising.  Very short and sweet.  It's typed as vag tightening, good for Ben's ex.  Ben with his huge hog, whatever.  And he just, like, messed it up by trying to...  He thought about it too much on hold, I think.  All right, Jimmy.  Any girl Ben dated would have to have her vagina sewed up with the type of rope they used 
[03:00:30]  to hold a ship to the doctor.  After all, barge cock yesterday with you.  I'm a big fan of exaggerated humor.  I love it.  It's funny.  For a while, I hated it, but I'm a big fan of it again.  It has a little small vagina.  Jimmy and Cormac.  Oh, guys.  Finally.  All right.  I'm sorry, pal.  Listen. 
[03:01:00]  This girlfriend of mine, right?  She goes and gets this done.  Now, Jimmy, you know what?  You put your seatbelt on.  Not only did she have the big pussy lips.  I mean, they were about an inch and a half in length.  She had a huge click.  She has them trimmed off, right?  Now it looks like Jimmy Durante down there.  She's got no feeling at all.  It's horrible.  Absolutely horrible.  Did you know she was going to do this?  Yeah, she told me.  She said, oh, I'm just going to have them shaped a little.  Yeah, shaped a little in my ass.  She's going to have them chopped right. 
[03:01:30]  They're like only like maybe, I don't know, an eighth of an inch, these things.  And then she's sick all the time.  Sick all the time?  What nationality is she?  Infections and shit, she's a pain.  You know who usually has larger, like, badges?  I noticed American Indians.  I swear to God, like, girls I've dated that were like part Cherokee or whatever.  I am fascinated.  You're kidding me.  I've noticed that larger, yeah, it's fucking hotter.  I'm just fascinated you've dated an American Indian.  Well, a couple of girls have had that in them.  Yeah?  Yeah. 
[03:02:00]  Had a little Indian.  This girl had it all.  She had it all.  It was, and now, like, sex even sucks now because she doesn't have any feeling like she used to.  Wow.  Yeah, it's like, you know, it's like, oh, it hurts.  It's like, oh, shut the fuck up.  Dude, why didn't you discourage her from doing that?  Oh, are you kidding?  I talked up and down.  What are you kidding?  I would have told her, if a girl did that, if she had, like, a body like that, so sexy,  I would have said, if you switch this, I will break up with you because I just couldn't,  I couldn't handle, I could never look at it again.  Were they ladies of the evening? 
[03:02:30]  Um, some, no, actually, no.  Not for the American Indian.  One might have been.  Hmm.  Your name, Hanaguakaho, mean, she who walks on own lips.  What the hell?  I never knew this, Jimmy.  Yeah, I've just noticed it.  You've taken an impromptu little study, have you?  I'm sure plenty of people will call up and say no.  Yeah.  They don't have bigger lips.  They just spilled some mozzola in their lap.  I call it maize. 
[03:03:00]  All right, guys.  They did ride bareback, so perhaps it was for years of riding a horse bareback to kind  of, you know.  Change the bloodlines forever.  Change their whole genetics.  Yeah.  Your great-great-great-grandmother rode a horse.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Had a flattened labia.  Ugh.  Marv.  That's it.  Marv.  Hey, boys.  Hey.  Good morning.  Grand Canyon twat.  Hey, my wife, when she had her little boy, we asked the doctor to do a honeymoon stitch 
[03:03:30]  for us when he got done.  A honeymoon stitch.  And he got mad at us.  We got pissed at us because my mother-in-law was standing there, and he told us it was inappropriate.  But it's like really tight now on the outside, but once you get in there, it's kind of like  going through a dog door in a house.  And then once you get inside the garage, it's like a big echo.  So, yeah, he stitched it up, like, right at the entrance.  Yeah.  So, it feels like you're constantly getting the index finger and thumb handjob. 
[03:04:00]  Exactly.  You know when you have, like, sex, and it's, like, really tight at first, but then it's  kind of loose inside there?  Yeah.  Yeah, Jimmy?  Yeah.  Exactly.  But, uh, listen, guys.  Sounds like you need some of that boy butter.  Oh, hey, and we're not all racist down in the South, man.  No.  We love everybody down here in Tennessee.  Well, Tennessee's a little different.  Yeah.  Is it?  No.  No idea.  I'll punch down. 
[03:04:30]  With nullification.  I watched a movie last night called, um, Rosewood, I think it was called.  I think I saw that.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Is that a fire in it?  Oh, it's a lot of fire.  Yeah.  A lot of lynchings, shootings.  Oh, it's brutal.  I think I remember that, yeah.  Oh.  Anthony, I gotta interrupt you because we have another valued listener checking in.  Atta boy, Ope.  Uh, valued listener, what do you got for the show?  What, me?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, I just wanted to let you guys know I am valued and, uh, my grandmother has an extremely 
[03:05:00]  tight pussy.  Oh, my goodness.  Uh, we got Donkey Sausage checking in.  DS, what's up?  Hey.  Hey.  Hi.  Hi.  Yeah.  Oh, um, I have a really good story for you.  When I was about 19 years old and I was sitting at a pool, a black guy came up to me and said,  Yo, Ma, don't get offended, but you have a fat pussy.  Did he mean P-H-A-T? 
[03:05:30]  Hmm?  Did he mean P-H-A-T or did he mean...  He meant I had a fat, juicy Arby's pussy.  Really?  Yeah.  And I was completely appalled.  And ever since then, I was always very self-conscious about my vagina.  Huh.  My vagina.  And, and is it nice?  Huh?  Do you think it's nice, though, now?  I guess.  I, I'm still very self-conscious about it.  I would, I'd probably consider the, the, the, the, uh, pussy, uh, what's called, uh, surgery. 
[03:06:00]  Here's how you know if it's too big.  Have you ever left a slug trail while you were doing jumping jacks?  Then your pussy might be too big.  All right, DS, we'll see you, uh, Friday, I guess.  We're going to be handing our WOW stickers all over Manhattan.  Word.  All right, there she goes.  Yo, ma, you got a fat pussy.  Yeah.  I've actually said that, too, at home.  Class act.  Oh, yo, ma.  I was eight at the time.  I got a rod for that story.  Really?  I swear to God.  Come here.  It's okay. 
[03:06:30]  Nah.  Take your word for it.  All right, this is what we're going to do.  We're going to try to do two things at one time here.  And then we got to get to the, uh, Greta, uh, Greta Van Susteren.  People are quoting, uh, lines from the movie Rosewood that I watched last night, Fast Freddy.  Oh, that's awful.  Well, Greta Van Susteren actually had a labia reduction on her face.  That's why she looks better.  Yes, she did.  Here's the deal.  We're going to play Guess What's in My Pants with Elizabeth from D.C.  Elizabeth?  Hi.  25 years old?  Yes.  Are you calling from a car?  No.  Where are you? 
[03:07:00]  I'm in my apartment.  Where?  On the balcony.  On the balcony?  Are you tanning?  No.  No, they're working on the fire alarm inside.  Well, then how are you going to do it?  Can people see you?  No.  No.  No.  No?  No.  What do you look like there, Elizabeth?  Uh, 5'4", 115 pounds.  All right.  Uh, any specks on your, uh, top, middle, and bottom?  Um, I'm, I'm, I have curves. 
[03:07:30]  Do you have big boobies?  Yeah.  How big?  Um, probably 34 C.  34 C?  Okay, very nice.  How tall did she say how tall she was?  5'4", right?  Mm-hmm.  All right.  Who do you look like?  Oh, gosh.  Rachel Lee Cook.  Cook.  Cook.  A Rachel Cook.  A Rachel Lee Cook?  What?  You know how to play Guess What's in My Pants?  Not really. 
[03:08:00]  Well, you're going to have to get, like, naked and stuff.  You got to at least take your pants off.  Oh, really?  Or pull them down.  You don't know how to play, do you?  Like you're making poopy.  I'm going to, all right, Elizabeth, thanks for calling.  We're going to cut our losses.  Yeah.  Beated fatso on the balcony.  Hope the alarm doesn't work and you fucking wake up with smoke in your lungs, stupid showstopper.  I know.  And we're flowing today.  We need a girl that knows how to play Guess What's in My Pants.  Yeah.  I'm going to ball up a fist and play Guess What's in My Mouth and it will be her shattered teeth. 
[03:08:30]  All right.  Nathaniel put together a pop culture quiz for old Jimmy Norm.  I've turned it over so he couldn't cheat.  This is round one.  I guess they're going to get harder.  Yeah.  Jimmy is really a pop culture retard.  We've learned this over the course of time.  He knows nothing.  We bring up things that everyone knows about just by watching TV, reading the papers, entertainment  magazines, and not even really pawing over this stuff, but just, you kind of just pick 
[03:09:00]  it up through your life, through living in this time.  But hey, for some reason, this just blows right past him.  Something else is more important than any of this and he just blows it off.  It's called pornography.  Yeah, exactly.  I was going to say, he knows the ins and outs of prostitution, so.  Yeah.  You should give us a prostitution quiz.  Okay.  That would be pretty funny, actually.  All right.  Let me find my buzzer so I can actually do this properly. 
[03:09:30]  That's too judgmental.  No, it is.  There's ten questions.  How many think, Ben?  Oh, yeah.  Let's think.  Jim, you're going to be serious, right?  There's a couple on there that some people couldn't get.  It was fun putting this together as we were all talking about what Jim would know and  what Jim would know.  I think I would have missed a couple.  There's a couple on there that.  Where's my buzzer, Hawk?  Hawk, get that goddamn buzzer or you're out.  Hawk, I can't find my buzzer.  You're out, Hawk.  Maybe I could help. 
[03:10:00]  Is that on the sound effect?  This one?  Try that.  Let me say.  Try it.  Hawk is very good at his job.  Oh, it does work.  Look at the booth.  All right, they're laughing.  They're laughing in the booth.  All right, here we go.  There's probably, I would say, three there that most people are kind of hard.  But the rest of them are.  All right, Jimmy, you ready?  I say Jimmy will get, let me look quickly.  No.  Let me look over those.  He'll miss this one.  I think he's going to get seven out of ten. 
[03:10:30]  Let me say, hold on.  You think so?  I think he'll get seven.  He'll miss this one.  Hold on.  He'll miss this.  He will miss this one.  He'll definitely miss.  What numbers?  You can tell, Hawk, because he doesn't have it in front of him.  He's going to miss nine, eight, and seven.  What's your name?  No, I have him missing a lot more.  And six.  Uh-oh.  You're only going to get six right, Jimmy.  No, it'll be up.  Oh, forget it.  He's going to get, wait, six, seven.  The only wrong question is the one not asked.  Oh, my God.  You're going to get that one wrong. 
[03:11:00]  Oh, my God.  What is a passing grade in the old school?  60.  60 is a D.  It was always passing.  I have him only getting four correct.  I think one is wrong.  I have him getting six wrong.  Anthony, I'm going to say five.  Really?  Yeah, I was as high as seven.  But six, seven, eight, nine, and ten are just going to be a disaster.  I say two.  No way.  Two?  Two he's not going to get.  Two he won't.  I would say he won't get two either.  I think he might.  Okay.  But definitely not five, six, seven, eight, nine, and probably not ten. 
[03:11:30]  All right.  Tim Norton's pop culture quiz, round one.  Who is Jessica Simpson married to?  And he's being...  No, I'm not fucking around.  Nick Lachey.  Wow.  All right.  Okay.  He gets that one.  I knew the Nick part.  I just was trying to think of Lachey.  Shut up.  All right.  And I'm trying to explain my thought process. 
[03:12:00]  No one cares, fat tits.  Go ahead, Anthony.  You give him the second one there.  What TV series is about a young Hollywood star and his entourage?  Entourage.  Oh, okay.  He gets that one right.  That was a little trick question.  That was a trick question.  I thought he wasn't going to get it right.  I love the face Jimmy makes all confident.  He's all confident.  I laugh at Entourage.  Come on.  Let's go.  All right.  What was the name of the last Star Wars movie? 
[03:12:30]  Revenge of the Sith.  Revenge of the Sith.  Oh, wow.  I had him get his list.  Did you see the list?  No.  No?  I'm just not a complete moron, dude.  No, you are.  I didn't think he would get that one right.  Were you in the studio the whole time?  I promise you I didn't.  I don't care if I get him wrong.  Actually.  Actually.  I admit that I'm not really pop culture.  No, it's not fun for me to cheat.  I expected him to pretty much get the first five right.  It's the last five that are going to be the last five.  I think he's going to get the first four right.  And then.  You don't think he gets five? 
[03:13:00]  No.  I think he gets, no, I think he misses five, six, seven, eight, nine, and ten.  We're talking about him like he's ten.  I like that.  All right.  This is the last one he probably gets right.  And then he doesn't get any more.  I don't think he'll get this one right.  You don't think he'll get this?  Okay.  What band sings the song American Idiot?  No idea.  No idea.  No.  For what?  You have no idea.  I certainly don't.  I had him getting this one.  No.  You want to take a guess?  Nope. 
[03:13:30]  Do we have American Idiot?  Yeah, let me hear it.  Play a little of it.  Wait.  See if he can get it after he hears it.  But you've already forfeited the song.  Wait, no, I have to hear it.  Well, now you would get it, I think.  No?  No?  Wait until the lyrics.  Hold on, hold on.  Don't want to be an American Idiot.  Don't want to nation under the new media.  I know this song, but I can't.  I don't know if it ends.  Yeah, because a lot of singers sing like this guy.  No, I know.  I just like him. 
[03:14:00]  Because so many singers sound like their nose is clogged.  It's Ozzy.  Ah, it's a little band called 1942.  A little band from a little movie.  Ed Nuttin' picture.  They bleeped the word fuck.  That must have been for the station that can't play the fuck word, right?  Yeah, no, there's probably two versions of that.  It's satellite radio, though.  Jesus.  You can handle a fuck on satellite radio.  There's happy, peppy satellite stations that don't play the best.  What is that?  I don't know.  It's Green Day.  That is Green Day.  No idea.  Wow, your first. 
[03:14:30]  Oh, Jimmy.  I've heard that song, though, but I just don't care about it.  It's not a bad song.  Jimmy, do you watch The Simpsons?  Never.  All right.  All right.  But they've been on TV for what?  12 years, 15 years.  Have they?  How long now?  16 years?  Yeah.  16 years.  16 years they've been on.  Jimmy, name all three kids in the Simpson family.  I know Bart and Lisa.  All right.  And I honestly didn't know there was a third one. 
[03:15:00]  The baby.  I don't know the kid's name.  The baby.  Don't know.  You've got to name all three.  There's no partial credit on this question.  I don't know it.  Fred?  What is it?  It's a little Maggie.  Never would have known that.  Never would have known that.  Wow.  Okay.  All right.  This is probably the toughest question on the sheet here.  All right.  You know there's a remake coming out of the Duke's a Hazard movie.  Did not know that.  Normally I see it. 
[03:15:30]  You knew that.  No, I didn't.  I'm not alive.  Let's just move on to question seven.  Well, let me hear.  Wait, you really didn't know they were remaking the Duke's a Hazard?  No.  Come on, Jim.  I swear to God, dude.  Are you serious?  No.  With Jessica Simpson, the commercials have been all over the place.  No idea.  I haven't seen the video.  I haven't had a TV in three weeks, by the way.  Dude, I haven't had a TV in three weeks.  Should I move?  I sold my TV.  Three weeks?  My new one's coming next week.  Three weeks.  This has been...  Dude, everything hasn't happened in the past three weeks, Jimmy.  What's the question?  All right.  Who plays...  Nick Lachey. 
[03:16:00]  Luke in the new Dukes of Hazzard movie.  I would have gotten one out of two.  Wait, wait, wait.  Bo and Luke Duke.  And I like the other actor.  I always forget his name, though.  Owen Wilson and Joel Steinberg.  He changed Lisa up in her little Daisy Dukes.  What's the answer?  I don't know.  It is Sean William Scott and Johnny Knoxville.  Name one other movie that Sean William Scott was in. 
[03:16:30]  I couldn't tell you his name right now again if you said it to me.  I never heard of him.  You never heard of him?  You never heard of him.  He's one of those young go-getters in Hollywood.  American Pie movies.  I've never seen it.  I know the movie.  Stifler.  Old school.  None of them.  All right.  None of them I've seen.  All right.  Let's go to question seven.  Who was the female lead in the Dark Angels series?  Queen Latifah?  Wait.  Do you know, though?  No. 
[03:17:00]  I've never seen that crap.  I'll give you a hint.  Her shoulder stinks.  Oh, where's she?  That Alba.  Jessica Alba.  We can't give it to him.  No, we can't give it to him.  Absolutely not.  That's another wrong one.  I swear he will not get it.  He got the first four or the first three.  Boy, I was giving you that Green Day one.  Ugh.  I was too, man.  I was too.  I was giving him the Simpsons.  No, I definitely wasn't giving him the Simpsons.  All right.  Here we go. 
[03:17:30]  Question number eight.  Jimmy.  Yes.  Your pop culture quiz, which you're doing miserably on.  X and Y is the most recent album from what band?  From what band?  X and Y?  X.  Right.  And Y, yeah.  Bam's Brothers Band?  No idea.  X and Y.  Oh, the Z's.  ZZ Top.  Yeah.  No, that would be Coldplay. 
[03:18:00]  Ugh.  Never heard of...  I wouldn't know one fucking...  If you said to me...  You know Coldplay songs.  Come on.  You can...  You can, uh...  How about, uh...  What about Clocks?  That's not from this album, but...  That was a big hit.  Speedus.  This song, Jimmy?  Oh, yeah.  You know this one?  Wait.  I gotta hear the hook.  This is the Chariot of Fire theme.  Faggoty nonsense this is. 
[03:18:30]  Only one of the biggest songs in the last ten years.  When he starts singing, I...  You must have heard this before.  Yes, Adler.  Okay, good.  You're getting hammered, Opie.  Sean William Scott was not in old school.  Fuck yeah, he was.  Told you.  Two different people said he wasn't.  Told you.  Dude, where's my car? 
[03:19:00]  Dude, where's my car?  Road trip.  Dude, hold on a minute.  He gave mouth-to-mouth to Will Ferrell.  Yeah, he is in that.  Whoa.  Absolutely.  That is it.  Why didn't people go to Internet Movie Database?  IMDb.  He was...  Yeah, he's the guy that shoots himself, uh...  He shoots him with the tranquilizer.  Yeah.  He's in the movie for...  Yeah.  Maybe that's not a great example of his work, because he's been in the movie for like two  minutes, but...  But he's in it.  All right.  Here we go.  Here we go.  Uh, Rob from Jersey, what part did Sean William Scott play in old school, Opie, you moron? 
[03:19:30]  Their phones went nuts, too.  And, uh, Sean William Scott wasn't in old school.  That's Eric from New Hampshire.  He played Peppers.  He is in old school.  Oops, right.  Wow.  Rob from Jersey, you dick.  There you go.  John, Denise, they're killing me on the phones, too.  Yeah.  Killing me.  He's in it for a couple scenes.  He's really...  Uh, Denise.  Yeah?  Hello? 
[03:20:00]  Hi, Denise.  Okay, yeah, you're right.  Okay.  Ah, you stupid bitch.  I love these people that are just so quick to jump down our throats.  Yeah.  And I'm driving in the car, so I couldn't look on the internet, but I was just like, I've  seen it 50 times.  God, I'm in it.  And you know what?  As soon as Anne said, you know, I started panicking, like, uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Uh, John and P.A.  Click.  Uh, let's go to Jason real fast.  Jason? 
[03:20:30]  Yeah, I'm here.  Go ahead.  Yeah, I just wanted to tell you guys, now the, uh, Weather Channel is using these, uh,  stupid scare tactics.  Instead of just showing the weather like they should, they got these cheese dick reporters  on there claiming that the, uh, heat wave is killing more people than bullets.  I mean, they had the, uh, bright orange flashing sign up there.  Heat deadlier than bullets.  Yeah, heat deadlier than guns and sharks.  Yeah, they did everything you can find out what you do to protect yourself.  The heat isn't very scary, though. 
[03:21:00]  Well, yeah, uh, the heat is more dangerous than shark attacks.  Yeah, more people die from heat.  And, uh, and bullets.  That is a fact.  All right.  Very good, Jason.  Okay, back to Jim's pop culture quiz.  Yes, number nine.  We're up to question number nine for those of you, uh, keeping tabs at home.  Um, just, can we just move on to ten?  There's no way he's getting this.  Who were the winner and runner-up for this year's American Idol? 
[03:21:30]  Runner-up was Bo, and the winner was Carrie.  Damn!  I was looking for last names, too.  But for Jimmy, I will give that to him.  I would definitely give him that.  Absolutely.  All right.  Bo Diddley and Carrie Fisher.  I would have messed up his last name, I think.  Wow.  Bo Bice.  There's one I never would have thought you would get.  No.  Carrie Underwood.  Yeah.  Jeez.  Anthony makes a good point from California.  Anthony!  Hey, what's up, sweet cheeks?  Hi.  What's Bo George's real name? 
[03:22:00]  George O'Dowd, sissy.  Yeah.  Who doesn't know that?  He knows pop culture from 20 years ago.  I do.  He's a pop culture archaeologist.  Everything about Black Sabbath, no problem.  All right, and the final question.  What is the name of the new PlayStation Portable unit?  PlayStation 3.  Wait.  He's scared.  Give him another chance.  I panicked because I saw the button. 
[03:22:30]  The PlayStation Fun Pack?  We would have accepted PlayStation Portable or the PSP.  Weren't you listening when we were doing, what was it, Gamefly?  Yeah.  Gamefly.com?  And I seem to have hit it right on the head.  Four.  Good job, Anthony.  Four, correct.  Not the four I thought, but...  I got a couple questions for you guys.  I just threw six of them together. 
[03:23:00]  I don't have ten.  Oh, boy.  Here we go.  Maybe you can...  What time are we breaking?  How much time do we have for a break?  Whatever.  We'll do it.  Give us six, and then if you can think up a few more.  Tim didn't want to get...  Tim didn't...  He didn't feel good about getting smashed.  I know.  No, no, no.  I didn't mind getting smashed.  It just...  It all depends on what's important to you.  That's what I mean.  All right.  All right.  All right.  What cover song appears on some versions of Black Sabbath's first album?  Some versions of the album.  Wow.  Cover song. 
[03:23:30]  It's a cover song.  Appears on some versions of their first album.  A kiss song?  No.  No, it's a cover song.  It's by the Yardbirds or something like that?  What do you mean?  I don't know who it's by.  I just know that Ozzy did not write it, or Sabbath didn't write it.  And Ozzy hates it.  And he shouldn't.  Hmm.  Paranoid?  I, Jimmy, have no idea.  Okay.  I will...  Two bunces.  One for me, one for Opie.  All right.  Yeah, you guys have to answer.  You have to make sure we all know that's our case.  Evil woman.  All right.  Let's see you guys on this one. 
[03:24:00]  Evil woman?  You don't know who did evil woman, though?  Nope.  Santana.  Okay.  I didn't know.  Robert Duvall's first film.  Jesus.  Oh.  I should know that one.  Robert Duvall's first film.  He had hair, obviously.  Yeah.  It was black and white.  Was it black and white?  I don't know.  Not even a hint.  Oh, wow.  Did he have a small part in On the Waterfront?  Yes, he played the doc. 
[03:24:30]  Look at how bad Jimmy gets.  He just wants to smash his back.  I know.  No, these are not...  Good job.  Let's see.  On the Waterfront.  Just thinking as you look to the left of the screen.  Oh, stop.  No, I already got it wrong.  I'm out.  Did you like the answer?  Yes.  To Kill a Mockingbird.  He was Boo Radley.  Oh.  Non-speaking part.  Very good.  All right.  How about this one?  Another very famous guy.  What was the name of Martin Sheen's first film?  This isn't pop culture, though.  No, I'm just saying.  It all depends on what's important to you.  That's what I mean.  Martin Sheen's first film? 
[03:25:00]  Yeah.  These are all movie questions and stuff.  And they're not that obscure.  I mean, they are pretty famous guys I'm talking about.  Obviously, before Apocalypse Now.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Again, I think black and white.  I'll give you a hint.  It also had Tony Missanti and Ed McMahon.  Jesus.  Ed McMahon.  Ed McMahon.  12 Angry Men?  No, I'm thinking it had to do with...  Evil Woman was ELO?  Oh, I have no idea who it is.  Is it one of those Cold War movies? 
[03:25:30]  No.  No?  Not at all.  Yeah.  Okay.  Evil Woman, it was the ELO version.  Bob and Carol and Ted and Alice.  There you go.  No.  There was a film called The Incident.  The Incident.  But you know how many people say,  I don't know their cars, though?  Let them.  I don't care what they say in their cars.  I don't care if they're in their cars and then they go,  oh no, a pole.  That's okay.  I don't care.  We'll take our beating.  You're not getting a beating, though.  It's not about that.  You're not supposed to know this.  What do we got?  Two more?  Three more.  All right.  What chapter, and this is a legendary question, 
[03:26:00]  was left out of the film version of A Clockwork Orange?  Wow.  Chapter seven.  No.  I had no idea.  It was 21 chapters, and it's a legendary lost 21st chapter of the book,  which completely changed any of the film, was left out of the script.  I had no idea.  What little film?  Little film?  What little film did Al Pacino do with Gene Hackman?  Hold on.  I want to just say, you turned our cute little fun little bit into a disaster.  No, I didn't.  I'm going to guess.  You're making us feel bad about ourselves? 
[03:26:30]  No.  That was supposed to be a cute little pop culture quiz.  Well, Nathaniel's not here.  I'd get him in here.  Believe me.  All right.  Go ahead.  All right.  What film did Al Pacino and Gene Hackman do together?  Hmm.  Yeah.  Here's my brain thinking.  I love that one.  No, it's Scarface meets the Poseidon Adventure.  Yes.  I'm very good at it.  I have no idea.  It was Popeye Doyle.  Hooah. 
[03:27:00]  Hooah.  Scarecrow.  Oh, Scarecrow, of course.  What?  And what 1960s song did Kiss cover on their Love Gun album?  And very well, I might add.  This one, a lot of people probably do know.  Kiss fans especially.  Sure.  I had that album, too.  Love Potion No. 9?  60s song.  No.  Nope.  And then she kissed me.  Then he kissed me, they cover, but they made it, and then she kissed me. 
[03:27:30]  Who did it originally?  With the Shirelles or something.  Wow.  Wow.  And then he kissed me, you know.  Ba-da-da-da-da.  All right, Jimmy.  We're not as smart as you.  No, it's not about being smart.  It's about what's important to you.  That was my point with this.  These are weird questions, but pop culture is not important to me.  Right.  All right.  Gee.  Boy, I feel pretty good about myself right now.  Thanks, Jimmy.  I just want you guys to know that.  You know where I'm sitting right now?  In my place.  And I was put there by Mr. Jimmy Norton.  That's right. 
[03:28:00]  One guy said he only got three out of ten.  I'm impressed with three out of ten as far as those questions go.  Go ahead, blues man.  No, I think he needs the pop culture questions.  I'm beginning to just feel bad because little Jimmy Norton just stomped me because he knew  the ones I didn't and I actually knew what the PSP was.  Oh, wait.  You only got three out of ten out of Jimmy Norton's quiz?  I only asked six.  No, no, no.  Of the pop culture.  Oh, I'm sorry.  The pop culture.  Yeah, of course.  Because we did ten there.  Yeah, Jimmy stomped me.  Little Jimmy, you know.  Joy Kits just stomped the shit out of me on that.  All right. 
[03:28:30]  Very good.  But you know what, dude?  I was purposely creating questions that I knew the answers to.  You know what I mean?  It's not like if all three of us had to answer the same level of tough questions, I would  be, you know, fucked.  By the way, Martin Sheen was in ten blocks on the Camino Real in 1966 before he was in  the incident in 67.  Okay, I stand corrected.  All right.  I meant to say second film.  I feel a little better about myself.  Give me an X.  Brian, what's up?  Hey, how you doing?  Hi.  Hey, ELO did Evil Woman, Evil Ways was fantastic. 
[03:29:00]  Oh, you're right, Evil Ways.  I'm sorry.  Hey, I love you guys, by the way.  I'm a converted Howard Stern fan.  Thanks, buddy.  I was converting Howard Stern.  Oh, wait a minute.  Tell him, Fred.  Tell him, Fred.  All right.  Thanks, buddy.  Fred ain't saying shit.  All right.  Very good.  Ask me any Beatles question.  Okay.  Okay, I got one.  Is it true they sang, And Jimmy Kissed Me?  Is that the, uh...  Oh, here's the original.  Yeah, let's play a little taste of this.  What is that?  From the kiss thing.  Oh.  Oh, shit. 
[03:29:30]  Hey.  Oh, and I write it?  Great song.  Well, he walked up to me, and he asked me if I wanted to die.  This was in a movie.  I can't remember which one.  He hurt, and he jerked.  Looked like he had a potato sack in his pants.  He hurt, and he laughed when I was just telling him very seriously.  Stars were shining bright, and then he did a line off my tits. 
[03:30:00]  I wanted to take out that giant cock and say, I love you, Ben.  Just what to do.  So I said, it's too big.  I can't fuck you.  He said he'll take my friends, and I'll skewer them, too. 
[03:30:30]  I'm glad I like this.  All right, very good.  Ba-dum-bam.  Old Jimmy Norton.  All right, we've got to get the Greta audio on before we get out of here.  We're not leaving?  Oh, Jesus.  It's unbelievable.  Wow, look at the tone already.  Why did I just panic like that?  How did that happen?  We're leaving?  Should we break?  Should we break?  Should we break or go to the end?  Uh, quick break.  We've got a break.  Quick break.  I came up with something years ago.  Basically, it says,  Whip them out Wednesday.  Big, luscious, juicy ones. 
[03:31:00]  Wow.  The swinging tribute to unrestrained female anatomy.  It's Whip them out Wednesday.  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  All right.  We're running out of show.  By the way, the guy who called up and said,  Ask me any Beatles questions.  Is he still on the line?  No, of course not.  I had a good one.  I had one that would trump him.  Oh, yeah?  What? 
[03:31:30]  What does Paul McCartney's wife have in common with justice that isn't carried out properly?  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  You asshole.  Wow.  You're horrible.  You know how bad I felt that day driving home?  I will tell you, though, Lady McCartney stewed tomato at your feet. 
[03:32:00]  There's a whole thread on Whackbag.  Oh, I know.  They made their own song.  They're still coming up with Beatles songs about that bit.  Stupid.  It made like your feet.  Oh, I laughed for hours about that.  Oh, that was bad.  So, what happened to the dude from Newsday? 
[03:32:30]  Oh, boy.  Was he a...  Did you hear what he did, too, when he almost got busted?  Robert Johnson was once the respected former publisher of Newsday and a member of the State  Board of Regents.  But his suave exterior belied.  Belied?  No.  I don't know.  Belied?  How many else?  One.  Belied, probably.  Belied his penchant for child pornography authority said yesterday.  Father with two kids.  Ouch.  Faces up to 50 years in prison.  Oof.  The indictment alleges the 59-year-old prowled the web from his office computer under the 
[03:33:00]  names Joe Bobo, Joe Bobo, Joe Bobo, 55, and Rob Job, 714.  Yeah, I'm Rob Job, 714.  And downloaded sickening kiddie porn films with names such as Real Child Rape.  Jesus.  You know what?  And the lighting in that one is so bad.  Are you insane?  Oh, it's horrible. 
[03:33:30]  Hey, I'm not the one who downloaded it.  The scumbag news guy is.  Right.  I don't watch kiddie porn.  I think it's awful.  He downloaded it and apparently he downloaded it to his business computer.  Yeah, because that will never come back to haunt you.  At his place of work.  Then he found out that they were on to him.  They were doing an investigation because they found these memberships, I guess.  I guess these people sign up to these. 
[03:34:00]  Memberships and kiddie porn sites.  Yeah.  They go to kiddie porn sites.  And they buy like these movies on sites using, what, credit cards?  What do you do?  I like to purchase some kiddie porn.  Do I get American Express points with this?  How much is that?  How do you justify when your wife is looking through your American Express bill and an eight-year-old  sodomy comes up on the bill?  Ah, it was just a little, you know, movie I bought.  A little movie.  And then he panicked, they said, and he tried to eliminate the files using some kind of file sweeper. 
[03:34:30]  He bought an evidence eliminator.  Evidence eliminator.  But I'm not sure if they actually have the evidence from what he had on his computer.  Reading that, it sounds like they don't have these movies.  They have a record that he downloaded these things.  He downloaded the kid rape or whatever it was.  Maybe they can go to your files and see where you've been and what you downloaded.  Well, that's it.  Or they traced it through the purchase of the movie. 
[03:35:00]  But they don't actually have the files.  They said that they're going to get them on some kind of evidence.  Destruction of files?  Destruction of evidence, yeah.  How are they going to get them on that?  I mean, look, the guy's obviously a sleeve bag.  But how can you prove those films ever actually downloaded?  They might have a hard time with this in court, but the fact of the matter is, he's done anyway.  He's ruined.  He is ruined.  You don't pop back from this one.  Yeah, he quit all his jobs.  Of course he did.  He's in hiding.  What an asshole.  I'm going to watch Child Torn full time now. 
[03:35:30]  A real child rape.  Yeah.  Wonderful.  That's a good title you want to just plunk down your mouse on and download.  Let's try to get the Greta stuff out of the way before we call it a day, guys.  The what?  Greta got some very interesting audio about the Aruba thing.  Greta van Cess.  Greta van Cess.  We got a clip of the DJ in the case.  Everyone knows the story, right?  Yeah.  My whole place, of course.  Drew's a boogie.  I thought it wasn't Drew's a boogie. 
[03:36:00]  Stop it.  It was the DJ from the boat, the party boat DJ, who was arrested on suspicion to be involved  with the disappearance.  That was the last place she was seen, kind of?  Yeah.  On this DJ boat?  Yeah.  And this guy is also the son of the judge.  One of these judges down there.  And they let him go.  Then he starts talking to Greta.  And his story starts falling apart.  So, I don't know.  Maybe they'll re-arrest this guy.  Why would you talk?  Shut up. 
[03:36:30]  Shut your trap.  Shut your yap.  Here's a clip of the DJ changing his story.  Answer one quick question to me.  This is what someone told me today.  Is that you voluntarily went to the police station and told a story to the police.  Did you voluntarily in the beginning go to the police?  Yes.  You did voluntarily?  Yes.  Who told you to do that story?  Is that Deepak?  No.  Nobody.  You just out of the blue?  Yes.  Deepak didn't ask you?  No.  You know Deepak?  No.  You don't know Deepak?  I don't know none of them.  You don't know Satish? 
[03:37:00]  I don't know none of them.  And you don't know you're on?  No.  You mean out of the blue you just decide, hey, I think I'll go to the police station and  make up the story?  Yes.  I have to take him to the airport.  So you just made that up?  Yes.  Why?  Don't worry.  Don't worry.  Just tell me why and I'll let you go.  Just tell me why.  Maybe I was trying to be a good person to help somebody.  That's it.  But helping guys you don't know?  Yeah.  You don't?  Deepak says he...  I heard you know Deepak from the cafe.  The internet cafe.  I just have a client.  Nothing else.  Not I don't know.  I don't talk to him or nothing.  But were you trying to help him out? 
[03:37:30]  No.  What story?  Just quickly.  What story did you tell the police?  I just...  I cannot tell.  Just give me a little brief summary.  I'll go.  I just told you guys right.  I don't want to talk anything about the case anymore.  I'm glad that I proved that man was sin and that's it.  Wow.  That story completely fell apart on him.  Good work by the Dutch police letting him go, you fucking Aruban shitheads.  They know nothing down there.  Anytime your police force is wearing flip-flops, they're not going to be effective.  And is there just reggae music playing down there everywhere? 
[03:38:00]  Oh.  Like everywhere you go, it's just the soundtrack.  It's all good, man.  It's all good.  Yeah, but she was killed and you said you were...  It's all good.  Good for Greta too, man.  She really went after that.  I liked it.  Yeah.  So you didn't know...  Wait a minute.  I'll let you go in a second.  That was actually great.  She really wrote this asshole into just yapping.  So you knew them.  No.  You didn't know them.  But you came forward and told the story to police.  Why?  I was just going to help him out.  So these guys are accused of doing something with this girl. 
[03:38:30]  He reads about it in the paper down there.  He hears about it.  And out of nowhere, out of the blue, just decides he's going to go down there and say  he was also involved.  Because you would do that.  You would just read the paper, find somebody that's accused of some crime, and go down there  and say, yeah, I was involved in this, that, the other thing.  And then when the police let you go, talk to Greta.  What's funny, because I've been calling the police, telling them, look, you can come to  my place and find my Spidey uniform.  Yes.  Spidey rapist, Jim. 
[03:39:00]  Fucking asshole.  How bad is that police force where they can't poke holes in this guy's theory?  He's so involved with this.  He's so obviously involved.  Of course he is.  We're running out of show.  Damn it.  Let's go to the next clip.  It's the security guard saying, father helped make up story.  The father of one of the kids.  Is this the guy we were just listening to?  No.  Okay.  This is a whole, I don't know.  No, no, no.  No, I don't think so.  Okay, no, no.  Go ahead.  He said the story being made up about dropping the girl off for the holiday was all something 
[03:39:30]  being made up.  He and the Dutch guy and the Dutch guy's fathers, they sit and made up the story.  The father too?  All of them.  They made up.  Did you specifically say, Deepak specifically say to you the father was part of that?  Deepak told me that he and the family sit down and they made up the story.  So family and not father?  Well, I don't know who the family consists of, but I know the father was involved, according  to him.  Okay.  They made up the story and they say that they didn't drop the girl off because they say 
[03:40:00]  they would give the police something to hold.  Normally when somebody's missing in Aruba, they will find them a few days later by a crack  house or with some beach bomb or something.  So they made it up.  But then when push comes to shove and nothing is going on, he decided to tell his brother  who will talk the truth and say exactly what took place.  Because he, I guess how much he, by that time he and the Dutch guy were saying different  stories.  So something wasn't going right.  Did they say why they created the lie?  Like I told you, they say like, they were hoping that something, the girl will pop up 
[03:40:30]  something a few days after and as they say that they drop her off at the holiday and  talking to a black guy, security guard dressed in black clothes.  So they know like the Arubian public knows a tourist has been missing.  They will find him a few days after by, like I say, by some crack house or with some beach  bomb.  So they made up something hoping that she would show up a few days and then they say, okay,  it's all good.  There she comes.  Just drive the cab and shut up.  I know what he's saying though.  You do? 
[03:41:00]  Yeah.  He's saying that a lot of times they'd be caught at the shop at the crack house a few  days later.  You are never, ever going to see CBS's CSI Aruba.  Absolutely.  We'll never, ever see that.  I guess we don't need the third club.  Hey, there's been a crime scene.  There's blood.  Clean it up.  Clean it up, bitch.  Also, how can we be so stupid?  And then he kissed me from Goodfellas when he's walking into the Copa.  Oh, right.  Yeah, that's playing.  I'm brain damaged. 
[03:41:30]  The bottom line is this.  That's Joran Vandersloot.  Looks like a, first of all, he has hair like Frenchy and he looks like just a snotty  jerk off.  If this country, if this is not solved, we should fucking ruin tourism from the U.S.  Never go there.  If these scumbags allow this to happen.  It's so nice.  Yeah, they're doing a good job with that themselves.  Oh, the beaches and everything.  I say ruin it, but let me get my cruise out of the way next year.  All the other islands are advertising like crazy. 
[03:42:00]  Yeah.  They smell.  We don't kill you.  They smell a victim.  Right.  Let's go to Matt in Jersey.  Matt, what did you learn on the O.P. and Anthony show today?  Hey, what's up, buddy?  Hey.  What's up, little Jimmy?  Hi, Matt.  What did you learn?  The girls get tired of tons.  Pat from Boston.  What did you learn on the show today?  I learned Pat Battle has a hemorrhoid like a microphone cover.  Battle.  Jamie, what did you learn on the show?  Hey, man.  What's up?  I learned everybody knows what stuff means dead or boss and random calls stink. 
[03:42:30]  If you don't believe me, listen to Donna Mike.  All right.  Very nice.  Let's go to Rob on Long Island.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Hey.  Yeah, I learned that Owen Wilson and Joel Steinberg are starring in the new Duke  of Azul.  Joel Steinberg.  Uh, Caulfield from Wack Bag.  Hey, what's going on?  I learned that, uh, rich people from Connecticut enjoy obese primates.  You guys know.  All right.  Thank you.  Let's see, uh, Chris, what's going on? 
[03:43:00]  Did the screener actually write obese primate on the, on the screen?  Yeah.  Moron.  Chris, what did you learn on the show?  What did you learn?  The party is over.  Everybody go home.  The party is over.  The party is over.  The party is over.  The party is over.  The party is over.  The party is over.  The party is over.  The party is over.  The party is over.  The party is over.  The party is over.  The party is over.  The party is over.  The party is over.  The party is over.  The party is over.  The party is over.  The party is over.  The party is over.  The party is over.  The party is over.  The party is over.  The party is over. 
[03:43:30]  The party is over.  The party is over.  The party is over.  The party is over.  The party is over.  The party is over.  The party is over.  The party is over. </pre>
