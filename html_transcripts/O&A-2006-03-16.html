<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a celebratory tone regarding their move to XM Satellite Radio after a contentious split with Infinity Broadcasting and their ongoing feud with Howard Stern.  This celebratory mood quickly devolved into vulgar and offensive banter.  The hosts detailed their new-found freedom and discussed an FMQB article confirming Howard Stern’s placement of a gag order on them during their Infinity tenure. This gag order, they claimed, prevented them from mentioning Stern and blocked guests like Matt and Trey of *South Park* and Buckcherry from appearing on their show.  They highlighted Stern's hypocrisy regarding free speech and his own comments about their show, emphasizing Stern's admission to the gag order.  

A significant portion of the show focused on Jimmy Norton’s unfortunate experience at a comedy benefit, where he was drenched in beer by a woman dubbed “Happy Typing Girl,” leading to crude jokes from the hosts.  Opie recounted an expensive and vaguely disturbing airplane experience involving whiskey and an unknown man, and he and Anthony engaged in a heated, profanity-laden argument about a hypothetical physical fight, ultimately rejecting the prospect of ever working for Howard Stern.  They further discussed their independence and success.

The show included a listener-submitted karaoke version of the Greg and Anthony show theme song and a review of their website's content, featuring listener-submitted photos, a Jim Norton photo, and a video of Greg Valentino draining an infected bicep, along with the “Rate My Wow” section featuring pictures of women's breasts. A caller, Craig, mentioned attending Jimmy Norton’s show, which segued into a discussion of Norton's comedy and the charity benefiting from his performances.

A substantial portion of the show was dedicated to a racially charged poem written and performed by seven-year-old Autumn Ashante, sparking debate on the child's culpability versus her parents’ and the media's double standard in covering such events.  The hosts engaged in an extensive and profanity-laced analysis of the poem and the broader context of race relations in America.  The conversation then jumped to an upskirt photo in the *Daily News*, the death of a deaf beauty queen, and a previously interviewed deaf comedian whose performance they found unfunny and awkward.  The alleged existence of audio featuring a fictional character, “Spuds Buckley,” from Opie’s past, led to further speculation and humorous impersonations.  The show played a clip of a Christmas song by a deaf singer, Def Jeff, that the hosts considered incredibly bad.  Steve, the board operator, occasionally interjected throughout this segment.

The show featured a discussion of comedian Kathy Buckley, a deaf woman, with the hosts reading from her biography and interjecting with crude humor.  They struggled to find audio clips of her work, leading to detours that included playing a recording of two intellectually disabled individuals singing "I Had the Time of My Life." Jim Norton was a guest in studio early in this segment, leaving for a gig in Atlanta, and Bob Kelly filled in for the remainder of the broadcast.  They discussed a planned live broadcast, speculated about future guests, and had side conversations about Jim Norton's personal life and the sitcom *Old Christine*. The segment concluded with a discussion of Francine's planned radio show and some of its content.

A segment discussed the disproportionate number of jokes about a particular racial group on a previous show, leading to a call for more variety.  This transitioned into an exchange of offensive jokes involving anecdotes from trains, planes, and CB radios among truckers.  A call-in segment featured Rob and another caller from Tampa recounting a raucous post-show encounter with Bob Kelly involving alcohol, women, and an unexpected kiss.  Francine then recounted two highly personal and explicit stories: her unexpected miscarriage at 17 and her first lesbian sexual experience, both recounted with candidness and detail.  The hosts and callers reacted with shock and laughter.  Francine later detailed another sexually explicit encounter, and the hosts and callers generated ideas for her upcoming radio show, emphasizing the explicit nature of the content. Bob Kelly also promoted his HBO show, *Torgasm*.  

A final segment featured Francine recounting a self-harm incident related to a miscarriage, described as “raping herself,” eliciting shocked amusement from the hosts and callers.  Listener calls followed, with several callers using crude and offensive language.  The segment concluded with promotional announcements for *Torgasm* and an upcoming live broadcast at the Hard Rock, with a mention of Francine appearing at the Village Mall. Bob Kelly was mentioned as a guest for both events.  Throughout the entire broadcast, Bubba the Love Sponge's repeatedly postponed challenge to Opie for a fight was mocked, culminating in Opie and Anthony declaring themselves "done" with him.  The "Pest," a group of their disruptive fans, was also referenced throughout.

[00:03:00]  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  Opie and Anthony are back, so why won't the FCC be able to touch them this time?  The duo has signed with XM Satellite Radio.  Their contract with Infinity expired back in May, but the no-compete portion is up until October.  No arrests have been made.  No arrests have been made. Police are still investigating.  We're all in! We're all in!  Let's do it!  The blonde blonde blonde, uh, two so-called radio shots.  Our society needs borders, needs parameters.  You dick! 
[00:04:00]  They get their jollies by saying, let's keep pushing the envelope.  They were doing what they were paid to do.  Shot.  Even when there are bucks to be made, there's a price to be paid in terms of the cultural degradation that we do not want to be associated with anymore.  Are you adequately prepared to rock, rock, rock, rock?  The Opie and Anthony show.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Yeah, exactly. 
[00:04:30]  Oh, mother fucker!  Mama!  People keep their hands off of my mill.  Oh, you like that, don't you, faggot? 
[00:05:00]  Hey!  Looking good, sports fans.  Guys, why don't you put so many jerks in the world at the same time?  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, Santini.  Why, why, why?  You want to eat me?  Then go ahead!  Go ahead! 
[00:05:30]  Go ahead!  Go ahead!  Eat me!  Go ahead!  Chomp on me!  Really?  That must be a clip from the bootleg of, uh, King Kong that I have.  Oops.  Never supposed to mention that.  Good morning, everybody.  How are you today?  Rise and shine.  Rise and shine.  It's time for another Opie and Anthony program. 
[00:06:00]  Yes.  Hello to everyone on Pal Talk.  Hi.  Wave to me!  Wave to me!  Oh, Jesus.  Angry.  There they go.  There you go.  Thank you.  Happy typing girl is in the mood to wave.  Oh, is she?  Is she after what she pulled last night?  What happened?  What happened with happy typing girl?  Jimmy, don't even start making friggin' enemies on Pal Talk.  Enemies?  Not making enemies.  What happened?  What happened?  Had a wonderful time at the Stress Factory last night. 
[00:06:30]  Oh, yeah.  How did that go?  It was great.  It was really good.  It was a benefit for you.  And it had something to do with Kenny Suns Athletic League.  Like, you know.  Please tell me they sold out.  Yeah, I believe they did.  Awesome.  It was very close for Wednesday.  We were thrilled.  Thanks for the support.  Kenny really appreciates it.  It was, you know, Florentine and myself.  Vos stopped in at the time.  Chuck McGanelli and Jameson from Meet the Creeps.  And Laura Levitas is a really funny, dirty, hot comic that I want to sleep with who just isn't interested.  And it was a good show.  And I met some people afterwards. 
[00:07:00]  I'm selling some shirts, you know, for charity.  LOL.  And Happy Typing Girl comes up.  Oh.  And she looks better in person, even than she does on Pal Talk.  Yeah.  I really wanted to touch her hiney right there in front of the whole crowd.  You know, just as an O&A thing, not because it looked good.  And we're chit-chatting, and she hugs me, and she leans over to talk to Stupid Vos, and she spills a full beer all over my fucking crotch and leg.  LOL.  Fucking Happy Typing Alcoholic. 
[00:07:30]  Fucking Happy.  Oh, that's perfect.  Dude, someone's got a picture of it, but it's, it's, it's.  Oh, is that perfect?  Dude, it went from, like, my helmet all the way down the middle of my, it's actually the reaction I probably would have looking at her anyway.  Yeah.  It was just like a big fucking stain in the front of my pants.  Yeah, she did you a favor.  Oh, Happy Typing Drunk.  Happy Typing Drunk.  I love that.  Covered up the clear stuff.  Good for you.  Good, Jimmy.  Good for you. 
[00:08:00]  Happy Typing, girl.  Oh, it was awful.  So I had fucking a big beer stain down the entire front.  And you just hate alcohol.  Did you throw the jeans away?  No.  I just fucking, what was it?  No, I just made her hug me, I think.  I tried to catch a little fucking helmet contact, and that was the end of it.  That was it.  What can I do?  Hot chick spills beer on you, and you're just going to take it.  Did you go home smelling a beer?  I didn't smell it at all, actually.  No.  No, I was just taking my pants off when I got home and just grabbing my dick and talking  to it.  You know, look how fucking close you are.  Who doesn't?  She didn't touch your dick, but the beer she was holding did, and that's kind of close 
[00:08:30]  enough.  There you have it.  Very good.  So that was my evening.  Good for you.  Happy typing, girl.  You need stuff like that every so often.  Let's say hi to Dan in Indiana.  Dan, what's up today?  Well, I'm trying to figure out, whatever happened to the sexiest state?  You guys spread the virus.  You got a lot more listeners.  Whatever happened to the sexiest state, you need to promote that a little bit more.  And guess what's in your pants?  You don't hear no more of that stuff.  I guess we just need to promote it a little bit.  Yeah.  We actually, New York just won again with Daryl Littlejohn. 
[00:09:00]  Well, yeah, but what was the last sexiest state you had?  What was it, Indiana or California or something like that?  Well, no, we did one very recently, actually.  The Map of Hawaii couple did it live on Pal Talk.  Yeah.  Oh, I guess I missed that.  Maybe we could get a couple to do it today or tomorrow.  That would be great.  Oh, well, tomorrow we can't because we're going to do a live broadcast.  Yes, we are.  I joined Pal Talk a couple weeks ago.  What is your name on there, Pal Talk?  If I ever get on there, if I could check you guys out.  My name is Kelhoff.  You can see me at Kelhoff. 
[00:09:30]  K-E-L-H-O-F-H-O-F.  H-O-F-F.  H-O-F.  11.  Okay, boys.  All right.  You guys have a good show.  All right.  You never know when sexiest state's going to happen.  All of a sudden, we're here.  We're minding our own business, and the phone rings, and there's a couple having sex.  Yeah.  We just didn't really promote it.  It just kind of happened when we first got here, and we made something of it, but we didn't  really talk about it.  Yeah, if you're a couple, and you're awake right now, give us a call.  If you want to have a little sex, you want to be a little amorous with each other. 
[00:10:00]  You want to spill a beer in each other's crotches.  It's never a loving couple, by the way.  No, it's just like someone picked up some slob at a bar.  It's usually someone on the West Coast, because it's like four in the morning.  The bars are closed.  Hey, you want to go back to my apartment for a nightcap?  Right.  Next thing you know, they're calling the Opie and Anthony show and railing this chick.  They don't know her.  She doesn't know them, and no one cares.  They just want to have fun.  Hi, who are you?  I'm Kathy, and they found me at a bar tonight. 
[00:10:30]  Oh, they did, did you?  Right.  And what's happening?  Well, I'm being fucked right now from behind.  Oh, fantastic.  How long have you known them?  A couple of hours.  A couple of hours.  How long?  A couple of hours.  A couple of hours.  A couple of hours.  A couple of hours.  Or it's like a bartender or a bouncer or something bringing one of these girls home.  That's some fucking going on out there.  Oh, it makes me laugh every time.  Let's say hi to Mitch in New Jersey.  Mitch, what's up? 
[00:11:00]  Hey, guys.  How's it going?  Hey there, Mitch.  You got a problem with me and a movie I suggested?  Oh, my God.  A history of violence was so unwatchable.  Really?  You've got to be kidding.  It was so bad.  The only good part of that movie was Maria Bella and her awful bush.  Was there awful big Harry Bush in that movie?  She was naked a couple times during the movie.  That is a plus.  Well, yeah.  That was a plus, but Ed Harris was the only good actor.  The worst movie ever.  You didn't think William Hurt was a good actor in that movie? 
[00:11:30]  He was up for an Academy Award.  I thought it was terrible.  I think you owe me $15, though.  Ah, all right.  I went and bought that movie last night based on that.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Well, it was on a lot of people's lists as one of the best movies of the year, too.  I really enjoyed it.  I really did.  I enjoyed it more than Crash, actually.  You bought it?  I didn't see it.  You know, I chose that one over Crash because you said that it was better.  See, I used to buy a lot of DVDs.  I don't buy the DVDs anymore, except for the classics. 
[00:12:00]  I wait until it goes on cable, right?  Yeah.  And then when it's on demand, on cable.  Then I'll check it out.  Before I blow up, I'm punching out.  All right.  I'll check it out there.  And then if I see a really good movie that has some kind of re-watchability, I might buy it if it's cool.  If there's a big DVD package that comes out with a lot of behind-the-scenes stuff of cool movies, I'll buy things like that.  The classics you have to own, things like that.  But as far as when they say, you know, movies that just came out, available now on DVD, you know, I don't think I'm going to go out and buy it. 
[00:12:30]  No, I don't do that anymore.  But the movies on demand, that's very disappointing here in New York.  I can't find movies that I want to watch on that thing.  There's like a thousand of them.  I know, but it's all...  And they're all crap.  Yeah, it's all those movies that are like, they were almost good movies, or they were bombs, you know.  Or you have to wait a really long time to get the big hits.  To get the good ones.  Well, you ever go to like Showtime on demand or HBO on demand?  The worst one has got to be the movie channel on demand. 
[00:13:00]  It's the worst.  There's like four or five movies, and it's like the Karate Kid 4.  Right.  It's just horrid.  Well, they have American Pie 4 or 5, whatever the hell they're up to.  I don't want to see American Pie 4.  No.  Who does?  And who did?  Nobody.  I go to the movies on demand where you have to pay for it.  It's like pay on demand thing.  Then they have like the movies that just come out of the theaters. 
[00:13:30]  Even those, most of those I don't want to see.  You've got to scroll through a lot of shit before you get some good ones.  I've been in a dry spell with the movies coming out.  I go to my theater like two, three times a week, and I look, and I'm like, I don't want to see any of this.  I don't want to see Brokeback.  I don't want to see...  I don't even want to see Munich.  I saw Munich.  Should I go see that?  You don't have to go.  I'll give it to you.  No, see, unlike you, I like leaving my house.  Everyone just throws their arms up in the air. 
[00:14:00]  I didn't say anything.  Unlike you, I like leaving my house.  I like the movie theater experience as long as it's not a weekend night.  I like going on a Tuesday afternoon or a Wednesday afternoon.  I really do.  Why?  You know what's in a movie theater?  People.  I understand.  People I don't know.  I understand.  Why do I want to sit with them?  Would you invite a bunch of people into your living room to watch a movie?  Why is it perfectly acceptable to sit around with strangers?  You don't know who the hell they are, what they're going to do to ruin your movie experience,  and sit in a movie theater. 
[00:14:30]  I would rather just put it on the big screen, watch it.  Who cares if every so often something scrolls across the bottom?  It doesn't bother me.  Oh, my God.  Will you shut up?  It doesn't bother me at all.  Shut up.  You're going to ruin it.  I enjoy it.  Rob on Long Island.  What's up?  What's going on, guys?  How are you doing, Caddy Daddy?  Hi.  Hi.  Yeah, I've made an observation.  I've been thinking that ever since Pal Talk has become huge, that Anthony doesn't read 
[00:15:00]  Instant Feedback anymore.  Is Instant Feedback dead?  No, I'll tell you what.  It's this crossover thing I've got to do between the two computers.  It involves pushing a button or two.  People enjoy when you read the Instant Feedback, Anthony.  All right.  We go through stages is what's going on.  Pal Talk is all the rage right now, and it's growing by leaps and bounds every day.  And eventually, you know, that'll calm down to a level, and then hopefully we'll balance  out the two. 
[00:15:30]  I'll pop it up today.  All right.  Okay.  I never typed Instant Feedback.  I was just, I've noticed that you don't read it anymore.  Oh, my God.  I forgot all the passwords for it.  All right.  Punch it out, boys.  Thank you.  It makes a good point.  I might get it.  It's a very interactive show with the listeners, and yeah, we haven't read as much Instant Feedback  lately on the air.  You know why, Ope?  Because we don't care.  Charlie in Jersey.  Charlie.  Hey, Opey, I've got to defend you, man.  I dropped $12 in a hotel room to watch A History of Violence.  I loved it.  There's three, like, killing scenes. 
[00:16:00]  I mean, he wipes out two guys in the restaurant.  He wipes out three guys on his front lawn with his kid.  He wipes out William Hurt in his mansion.  I freaking loved it.  I didn't see it, sir.  Don't blow it.  The opening scene alone was amazing.  Loved it.  That's what's weird about movies, though.  There's movies you're convinced everyone's going to love, and then, nah, I didn't like that.  And then there's bombs out there where you're like, why would you ever go see that?  And people will tell you it's the greatest movie they've ever seen.  Yeah.  Doesn't make sense.  Love it, dude.  Well, I own Soul Plane.  I bought that on DVD. 
[00:16:30]  It's just fantastic, isn't it?  Yeah.  The acting, you know, you sit there, you cry, you laugh.  It's wonderful.  It's actually less embarrassing for black people than this seven-year-old poet running  around.  Smack that kid right in the face.  Oh.  Momo.  Why are the people, the devil, all right, we get it.  You're adorable.  Exactly.  Here you go.  Nice picture in the Daily News.  Oh, shit.  No, that's not that page, Jimmy.  That's a different story.  We'll get into the young poet in a little while.  Yeah, and more hypocrisy in our society, by the way. 
[00:17:00]  Yeah, we'll get into some current events for once.  We haven't done current events in a couple of days.  Hey, Momo, what do you got today?  All right, Opie, I promise I will stay on topic.  Okay.  I'm going to tell you that I think Howie is the ultimate in a hypocrite because, you  know, Howie was doing the things he's done to you, and now he's being sued by CBS.  And yesterday he mentioned in his interview with Sean Hannity that he believes in free 
[00:17:30]  speech when it comes to just him, but when it comes to his competition, he just wants  to atomize him, I think is what the term he used.  Yeah.  And basically that's what CBS is trying to do to him.  I mean, they're just, you know, it's all business, and they're just trying to stick  it to him as he stuck it to them while he was on their show.  So, yeah, we're going to, you know, we're going to keep the Howard stuff to a minimum  today.  Yeah, we addressed it in depth.  But yesterday was a great day for the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:18:00]  We always, we have this thing we say from time to time that Opie and Anthony always win  in the end.  Sometimes it takes freaking years.  And FMQB wrote an amazing article yesterday that was very positive for us.  You can go to FMQB.com.  I think the article's linked on OpieandAnthony.com.  I want to acknowledge the Pest.  Yes.  Because the Pest got some more ink.  Ink and pictures.  And pictures this time.  And this just motivates the Pest to do more, to do more missions, by the way. 
[00:18:30]  They love the publicity.  Yeah, absolutely.  They're like serial killers.  Absolutely.  They just love hearing about themselves in the news.  And they're referred to as Pest in this article and everything.  It's just a perfect article.  Howard Stern admits to Opie and Anthony gag order.  This is absolutely huge.  Huge for this program.  This is one of the premier industry papers, magazines.  And this, in the radio business especially, is just huge news that he fessed up to this. 
[00:19:00]  Because it really makes him come off as a hypocrite.  Right.  Everything we've been saying for years is in this article and has finally been proven as true.  Yep.  And it's just unbelievable.  Howard Stern admits to Opie and Anthony gag order.  The feud that started between Howard Stern and Opie and Anthony, while both were employed by Infinity Broadcasting, is reaching new levels on satellite radio with both parties taking shots at the other.  But while sitting on Sean Hannity's program yesterday afternoon, Stern finally admitted to the long-rumored gag order that he had Mel Carmers in place on O&A when they were handling afternoon drive at WNEW New York. 
[00:19:30]  Very key to this story.  Yep.  We worked for the same company.  And we didn't directly compete with Howard Stern.  No.  We were doing our thing in afternoons, and he was doing his thing in mornings, and the ratings weren't affected in the end.  He still had monster ratings, and he was still number one.  We were having no effect on his ratings.  No.  But the fucking paranoia and the ego that this guy has got the best of him, and behind the scenes he played these games. 
[00:20:00]  For what reason to this day, I don't know.  I mean, how scared was he of us?  I think from his actions, you can tell, very.  Right.  His worst nightmare was that maybe, I'll give him a little credit, maybe he was thinking ahead.  Maybe he was actually thinking ahead and seeing what was going to happen during our negotiation we had with Infinity when we were employed with them. 
[00:20:30]  Because what happened?  And Clear Channel came along and wanted to put us in mornings at Q104, directly against Howard.  When our contract was up.  When our contract was up.  This was before we got fired.  Yeah.  And maybe...  Not fired, but let go.  He had the foresight.  Blah, blah, blah.  Go ahead, sir.  Maybe he had the foresight, saw that coming, and figured he'd try to squash us then and there, before we even came up and competed with him.  And, uh, oops!  That didn't work out, did it?  And now it's completely backfiring. 
[00:21:00]  Because he looks like a big hypocrite.  Right.  The article continues with a fine picture of the pest with their signs.  Yeah.  Outside the David Letterman studio, and the caption reads,  Howard Stern meets the ONA pests while entering David Letterman's studio.  You know, there's only, like, an army of four or five.  Yeah.  But, man, do they make an impression.  Enough that the media is picking up on it.  When Stern was asked by a caller about the gag order, he confirmed it by admitting, that's right, I believe in censoring anyone who is my enemy. 
[00:21:30]  He also added, I believe in censorship when it benefits me.  And, like, we backed up here and said, you know, key to the story, we weren't his enemy.  We were working for the same company, and we weren't on the same time as him.  We were all making money for the man, man.  Playing back that audio on their XM satellite radio program this morning, Anthony noted the hypocrisy of that statement by saying,  he'd been complaining that individual members of the FCC were putting their morality on his program instead of interpreting FCC law,  which is exactly what he did with us. 
[00:22:00]  Earlier in the program, Stern addressed ONA by saying,  when I'm in business with the company and they hire Howard Stern imitators to go on in the afternoon,  I don't want anyone knocking me.  I have a plan every time I go up against people.  I analyze the competition.  I think about you six different ways.  So Sunday, I turned to Mel Carmisen at the time.  Your two boys that you hired who sounded identical to me will implode.  I give them three to four months.  They're so desperate to be famous, they're going to do something stupid.  If they can't talk about me, they're going to go insane. 
[00:22:30]  Watch.  He laughed since I made other predictions about radio, and I watched him implode.  This statement is completely false, by the way.  Completely false.  We lasted three years at Infinity Broadcasting.  They point that out.  While it took three years of WNAW broadcasts where ONA to, as Stern suggested, implode,  the duo has had a successful run at XM and recently revealed they are in negotiations for a new long-term deal.  But going back to the Stern drama, ONA say they didn't start this feud and that it was Stern who started calling them copycats 
[00:23:00]  and felt threatened by their show.  When we came into New York City, we knew you don't come into Howard's backyard and start bashing him, said Anthony.  What we did was slowly build up an audience that happened to be his audience driving home.  We had a common audience.  He saw that somehow as a threat, which is so fucking delusional.  He saw there was potential for the Opie and Anthony show to get an audience and perceived it as some kind of threat to him.  We didn't attack him as a human being, Anthony continued, explaining they would parody Stern. 
[00:23:30]  I would do impressions of him and suggest maybe he wasn't as close to his audience as he once was  because he's winging out to the Hamptons and the Howie copter.  That was Anthony again.  Instead of coming back to us on the air and battling us that way, like he had with John DiBella  and many other personalities across the country, he went behind the scenes to Mel Karmazin  and had him drag us into his office and threaten us with a firing if we didn't stop talking about Stern.  Hannity, appearing on ONA's program this morning discussing the Stern interview, 
[00:24:00]  tried to say Stern deserved credit for not dodging the subject, but ONA immediately cut him off,  pointing out that this is the first time in the five-plus years that Stern has admitted to his behind-the-scenes wrangling.  They also pointed out that the issue went beyond ONA not mentioning Stern on their program  and included guests being blocked from appearing on their show.  This is something else we've been saying for years, and people are like, yeah, right,  like they really would do that, working for the same company.  And here's another thing we heard. 
[00:24:30]  Oh, like they even knew you guys were on the radar screen.  Like they even knew that the Opie and Anthony show existed.  Like you guys were important enough that they would keep guests off your show.  Dude, they weren't even thinking about your show.  Oh, really?  Really?  How about this now?  Now we get a little vindication.  Well, that's being...  Jackass.  We're being proven as, you know, telling the truth.  Right.  I mean, our old show was like C-list celebrities and bands no one gave a shit about.  Yeah, every once in a while we would be throwing a bone and get a cool band in or something, 
[00:25:00]  but it was every once in a while.  And we came from a station in Boston where the whole thing that Anthony and I were into  was the latest music.  We were interviewing bands almost every day.  We had a real good feel for that stuff.  We come to New York and it would have been perfect to continue that relationship I had  with all these bands.  And all of a sudden, these people we thought were our friends all sound like, yeah, we're  sick.  We can't come on the show.  All these lame, weird excuses.  I'm like, what the fuck is going on?  And then people behind the scenes started telling us exactly what was going on. 
[00:25:30]  And we couldn't really, you know, completely prove it.  We just knew.  We just knew from the people that were telling us that it was true.  So anyway, the article continues.  They also point out that the issue went beyond O&A not mentioning Stern on their program  and included guests being blocked from appearing on their show.  One CBS radio insider told FMQB that at the time, then K-Rock PD Steve Kingston would block  music artists from appearing on O&A's program. 
[00:26:00]  A statement verified by a couple anonymous record reps.  Here's a quote.  There was an admission that they were telling people not to appear on our show, explained  Anthony.  Yep.  Verified by record reps.  And it was Steve Kingston, the guy that XM just hired, by the way.  Yeah.  So maybe our pest could start emailing Steve Kingston and ask him, you know, what is he  going to do to make good on the bullshit he pulled back in the day?  He owes us.  He fucking does owe us. 
[00:26:30]  We knew this was true.  And they were laughing the whole time at K-Rock.  Laugh your goddamn heads off.  And they made us look like assholes on many occasions where we would actually promote  a guest.  Promote a guest because we'd go through other channels to get the guest on our show.  One of the most famous ones is Matt and Trey.  Matt and Trey from South Park.  We had a great relationship with them when Anthony and I were in Boston at WAF.  We were interviewing Matt and Trey before anyone knew what South Park was about. 
[00:27:00]  You know, we had a great relationship with Comedy Central at the time.  And they came to us and said, hey, man, there's a new show that's going to be unbelievable.  The reviews on this are great.  Would you like to have them on?  So we were interviewing them before the episodes even started airing.  And then the relationship continued.  It was a nice little relationship.  They would call our show every once in a while.  So we come to New York and we're like, we're excited.  Our old friends Matt and Trey are coming by.  And we sat on our hands all afternoon going, what the fuck?  Where are they?  And it turned out Steve Kingston blocked this from happening. 
[00:27:30]  Well, and those guys are kind of pussies too because when you're at South Park, man,  they should have come on the show and not allowed Kingston to fucking cock block it.  Right.  Another really good example is Buck Cherry.  They were hot at the time.  We promoted the hell out of them.  We played their music on our show.  And we were going to do like a show at a rock venue with them.  Promoted the hell out of it.  It was an Opie and Anthony event.  Join Opie and Anthony, I forgot the place, with Buck Cherry.  They blew us off.  They were supposed to come in, play live, and we were going to interview them. 
[00:28:00]  And also we're like, this is our show.  What the fuck happened?  They came up with some lame excuse.  This would be completely acceptable if it was like Clear Channel.  If their show was on Clear Channel and we were on Infinity and they had some kind of juice  and kept guests off our show.  Completely acceptable part of radio warfare.  When you consider we were working for the same company.  It's supposed to be the same, you know, end cause here.  Make Infinity money.  Right.  And, uh, nah.  It didn't work that way.  Yeah, that's what's amazing about this whole thing. 
[00:28:30]  We were working for the same fucking company.  Apparently they did give a shit what we were doing over there.  And then the article finishes up.  Back to current day, ONA and their pests.  And there's another picture of the pests.  They got two pictures in this article.  And this picture just has a caption that says, the ONA pests.  Yep.  You guys rock.  Back to current day.  ONA and their pests have been wreaking havoc with portions of Stern's Sirius satellite radio channels.  Recently, Scott Farrell's test run on Sirius was derailed by ONA fans. 
[00:29:00]  Uh, ONA's fan base as they inundated and controlled the phone lines, making it impossible for Farrell to get a caller on the air that wasn't a fan of ONA.  Yes.  We destroyed him.  The pest destroyed him.  Took over that channel.  It was the pest channel.  Oh my God.  The pests are getting inked today.  That's not, that's not good.  Their egos are growing as we speak.  They're applauding on pal talk.  Oh yeah.  They're calling each other.  Mm-hmm.  Messing boards.  General Bam was there fucking blocking people's pictures last night with his fucking awful tucked in shirt. 
[00:29:30]  He's putting his hand in front of people as they're taking photos.  He's having a ball by the door, annoying everyone.  Being a pest.  ONA have also been pointing out what they call more hypocrisy by Stern for taking off certain Fridays.  Right.  Playing audio of Stern, Robin Quivers, and Artie Lange discussing why it is important to be in the studio five days a week.  And a quote here.  If you're not there on Fridays, then you're doing a disservice to your audience, says Stern in the audio clip. 
[00:30:00]  If you're going to do this job, then you show up every day and give it your best.  Oh well.  Don't show up every day and kind of phone it in.  That seems to be his credo now.  Meanwhile, despite denials by CBS Radio that have been reported elsewhere,  they talk about everything that's been going on with this show.  Yeah.  We're very much in the public eye these days.  Yeah.  Meanwhile, despite denials by CBS Radio that have been reported elsewhere,  ONA insists they were absolutely contacted by the radio company to replace David Lee Roth. 
[00:30:30]  We've been negotiating with them for a few weeks, said Opie.  When it was first presented to us, it was a done deal.  And then you get lawyers going back and forth.  ONA also told Hannity that there were major hurdles that need to be cleared,  and they didn't want to compromise the integrity of their program to fit terrestrial radio broadcast standards.  We love being on satellite radio, said Opie.  If it compromises our satellite radio show too much, then we don't want to do it.  Right?  Very accurate article.  So just an amazing article by FMQB.  It's linked on opieandentony.com right now. 
[00:31:00]  Wonderful.  Wonderful.  It just feels really good to get some of that stuff out there.  Yeah, it's been five years, but, you know, kind of nice.  It feels good to be proven right once again.  Kind of nice, finally.  Because we really try to keep an honesty on this freaking radio program.  We really, really try to do that to the best of our ability, you know.  And congratulations to the Pest once again.  Those guys are getting smarter, by the way.  They're getting very smart with the things they do,  and that's very important to that whole Pest mentality. 
[00:31:30]  It's very important.  So keep that up, all right?  Let's see how to – who's this from Wackbag?  This is Minge.  Oh, what's up, Minge?  Hey, just wondering, could you play that audio of Howard Stern  saying that he would never cock-block someone from being on radio?  Oh, we got that one?  Yeah, we probably have that somewhere too.  Yeah, we can find that for you maybe later.  We don't want to spend too much time on him today,  but that was important to us to read that article.  Very important to us.  All right, thank you. 
[00:32:00]  All right, bro, thank you.  Let's say hi to Paul in New York.  Paul, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Look, dude, I've got to say right off the bat,  I'm a huge fan of yours.  Stern is a fucking scumbag and a tool.  But you've got to remember, you know, at the end of the day, like you said,  Jay Moore always said in that movie, it's, you know, show friends, not show business.  Right.  Show business.  I mean, the other way around.  Yes.  Right, right.  Hold, sir.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Two seconds.  Two seconds, please.  Hold on.  Hold on.  This will be quick.  Wait.  Right? 
[00:32:30]  You can continue.  Sir, not only did you misquote, but you got the complete polar opposite.  Right.  I did.  That's all right.  You got me.  I'm not a bad person.  Just a dope.  You know, dude, people destroy each other in the same company all the time.  And I think sometimes people in the entertainment industry, like, you know,  you see Dave Chappelle talking about it.  You guys don't realize, man.  Dude, we understand.  We understand that.  That's why it's the business.  Yeah, that's why we fought the good fight.  We wanted to make people understand, look, this is what's going on behind the scenes. 
[00:33:00]  You got a guy that said he would take on all competitors on his show,  did a great job with that over the years.  But somewhere along the line, stopped doing that and started playing these dirty tricks behind the scenes.  And we weren't going to let him do that to us.  That's the difference.  You know, he was such a hypocrite with the shit he would say on his show.  And then behind the scenes, he would have these rah-rah meetings with Mel Karmazin,  who, you know, he's really tight with, and used his power.  Sir, the difference, I know what you're saying, the difference between this, like, radio and stuff.  I was talking to someone about this last night, and she's like,  why is it like the guys are fighting so much on radio? 
[00:33:30]  The reason that people are so interested in this show, Howard's show, other shows,  is because it's a four-hour-a-day soap opera.  People become a part of your life.  Why would people care that I got a photo with a band if they didn't care about me?  It's a soap opera.  People get involved in who you are.  They care about who you are, and they relate to it.  So when your whole platform is built on being a certain way  and having a certain, like, connection with people  and a certain honesty with people,  and then they find out, my God, that's not the guy that I connected with all these years, 
[00:34:00]  yeah, he made you laugh, and yeah, he did all this stuff,  but I think that's why it's so, it should be harped on.  When you build yourself on being a freedom-of-speech person,  you go behind the scenes and do some dirty shit like that,  and going to the boss is dirty shit, man.  That's the thing with this show.  There's just so much honesty on it, and the thing I really love,  I know people bitch all the time, but I love Ope when you talk about  all the behind-the-scenes stuff, and just radio in general,  but as well, you know, with Howard.  Right.  You know, you just see what it's on.  Well, you know what, and the reason people love this show  is because they identify with you, no matter what you do for a living, okay? 
[00:34:30]  I mean, I work in the corporate world,  so I identify with a lot of shit you guys talk about,  but, you know, you guys are the people that started at the bottom,  busted your ass, took chances, should have given up,  should have failed, but didn't, and you made it.  And you guys give hope to fucking every one of us, man.  I know, you know, we like to joke around on this show  and not be serious, but that's really what it is, man.  Every day I listen to you guys, I'm like, Jesus Christ.  It is a matter of, I'm sorry to interrupt you, bro, 
[00:35:00]  but you're right, it's a matter of relating,  and the bottom line is people somehow connect to the fact,  like, you hear Anthony talk about being a tin knocker,  and it's like that's what people relate to.  They're just fucking knocking tin and going home  to a $12 million house.  They just made it very difficult for us to succeed back in the day.  Now when we have a guest booked on the show,  we know they're going to show up.  It got to a point where we're like, well, will this guest show up?  We don't even know.  We don't even know until that door opens and the person comes in.  It was unbelievable, I got to tell you. 
[00:35:30]  And we would go to our bosses like, what can we do about this?  We work for the same company.  Why are they cock-blocking us?  And then one of our biggest problems was, all right, they're doing this.  Why can't we address it on the air?  Right.  Well, because you can't talk about Howard.  Oh, yeah, no.  Because Mel said no.  No, you can't do that.  You know how frustrating it was?  It wasn't just a lot of the people over at the Stern camp  would like you to believe that we wanted to talk about Howard  just because we're in love with him  or we have nothing else to talk about him. 
[00:36:00]  We're so enamored with him that we just wanted to talk.  We can't do a show without talking about him.  That's what they want you to believe.  And when he put this gag order in place,  he likes to spin it like,  well, I just made it so they couldn't talk about me.  No, we wanted to talk about him  because he was fucking us up the ass on almost a daily basis.  And we wanted to address it.  Why aren't the guests showing up?  Why aren't we getting the bands in?  Why are we getting fucked at every turn?  Because of, uh-uh-uh, because of radio edit, we can't say it. 
[00:36:30]  It was very frustrating.  And it's nice to have it come out now  and, uh, even after five years, kind of see the light of day.  And, uh, to the pests out there,  don't let Howard ever forget what a hypocrite he really, really is.  We always win in the end, guys.  Love it.  Thank you, Paul.  I really appreciate you.  Bye, mister.  That's, uh, kissing today.  I know.  You got the paper towels?  Can you throw them?  My ass is slathered with that guy's saliva.  Let's go to Scott in Virginia.  Scott. 
[00:37:00]  Hey, good morning, fellas.  Hey, Scott.  I'm looking for you.  Yeah.  Does Kingston work for ELO?  Uh, yeah.  Yeah, ELO is there.  And why not have ELO get Kingston on the phone and call him out on the air?  I think he should come on the air.  You know something?  I think it is time.  We should call his ass out on the air.  Well, the pest will be calling out Steve Kingston.  I think that will make for some great radio.  Yeah, what is he going to do to make good?  What is he going to do now to make good?  Because now we're on the same side.  I want to hear a full confession.  What is he going to do?  I don't have the pest do it.  Let's do it on the air.  And then I have to hear behind the scenes from, I'll just say people, you know, Kingston 
[00:37:30]  really is a big fan of you guys.  He's always really admired you guys.  You know, he thinks you guys are terrific.  He thinks you're really talented.  He thinks you're better than Howard.  This is all the shit you hear behind the scenes.  Really?  Well, what are you going to do, Steve, to make good on the shit you pulled years ago?  Give him a call and find out.  Because you now work for the same company we do.  Well, that didn't stop him last time.  Yeah, good point.  We worked for the same company then.  Is he secretly working with the broad-minded chicks and he's going to continue, you know, 
[00:38:00]  cock-blocking us?  I don't think we're going to get any guests from the 70s channel now.  You know, a bunch of horse shit.  What are you going to do?  Let's see something now.  Let's see something.  Thank you, Scott.  Yep.  All right.  Well, we should definitely move on to other things.  Yeah.  You want to cover the other thing that's kind of similar to that real quick?  Oh, yeah.  And all the shock-shock news?  Yeah.  We ought to get it just out of the way at the beginning.  All right.  It's short.  We are not going to dwell on this, but this is just too funny. 
[00:38:30]  It really is.  I swear to you, we were in the office talking about this, and we were just going to blow  it off.  We said, you know something?  We've given it too much time, more time than it's worth recently, and let's just blow  it off.  But then a highlight came in, and we're just like, okay, now we got to do it.  Now we have to.  Now we have to, because it's just too funny.  Well, you know, let's explain to all the faithful listeners out there.  The battle is Opie and Anthony versus Howard Stern.  Yeah.  You know, Bubba the Love Sponge, he's a cute little side note, but he knows the battle's 
[00:39:00]  not, you know, he's not part of this battle.  It's not about him.  The press isn't writing about him and us.  The press is writing about Opie and Anthony and Howard Stern.  Yeah.  And it's getting more and more interesting every day, this battle that we're doing on  satellite radio.  But Bubba, because he has to kiss Howard's ass, you know, to have a job, feels like, you  know, he's part of this.  Bubba, you're not part of this.  You're not.  Sit on the sides and a sideline and watch.  At least he talks in his real voice, though.  I kind of admire that.  You like that, Jimmy? 
[00:39:30]  I really do.  So why don't you give the setup here, Anthony, and then we'll get to this glint that's just  going to make a lot of people laugh hard.  We'll bring the funny back into the show.  Trust me.  Well, apparently, Opie, Bubba's got a bigger problem with you.  I think I attribute this to me being just so likable to everybody on the planet.  Well, you are terrific.  I'm a nice guy.  I'm very likable.  And you do impersonations.  If you close your eyes, you'd think you was the wrong person.  I could see how a white girl would fall for you.  Anthony, you make people just feel good.  I try on a daily basis. 
[00:40:00]  I know that's my job.  I make people squeeze their steering wheel really hard.  Yeah, you, on the other hand, very annoying to certain people.  You get what they call under their skin.  Yeah, I understand.  And you've done it with Bubba.  I can't help it.  I just love that part of me.  Yeah, I really do.  And it does make for some great radio.  You're a flesh-eating virus.  Yeah.  Thank you, Jimmy.  You just get under there and rot their skin away.  Thank you.  And Bubba, very angry with you.  But every time he tries to call me out, he calls me Anthony, and then has to stop. 
[00:40:30]  I mean, Opie.  He doesn't even know.  The Opie and Anthony thing can be very confusing for people.  Sometimes people mix it up and go, Opie.  Right.  The Opie and Anthony show.  It doesn't really roll off the tongue.  Right.  But he's very angry with you and wants to fight you.  Right.  So that's what men do.  And that's what a man's man would do.  In an octagon.  In an octagon, some kind of wrestling ring, anywhere.  You know.  And he wants to sell tickets. 
[00:41:00]  Charity event.  I was talking to Elo about this, by the way, because I'm like, I can't believe we're dealing  with hack radio.  And I was telling him what was going on with this, you know, behind the scenes.  And I was saying, this is one of the funniest things ever.  Yeah.  Because it plays right into the fact that it's hack radio that we absolutely hate.  Yeah.  And Elo goes, dude, he used to do this all the time.  He used to like.  And Elo said something like he fought my afternoon drive guy in a charity event.  And I'm like, ew, ew, where you sell tickets and then you give the money to a charity. 
[00:41:30]  Ew, ew, did you, did you wear the charity shirt with the red cross on it?  Yeah, you know, all kidding aside, it's good to help kids.  Ew.  Talk in your real voice, fat boy.  And he doesn't get it.  Learn from us.  That hack radio shit doesn't work anymore.  It doesn't watch people don't see it as sincere and honest and real.  You've got to go on the air with your real radio, real voice, I should say.  Real voice, real voice.  This is the big apple, mister. 
[00:42:00]  Talk in your real voice.  Just have discussions about life in general.  So I told Elo, and we were having a big laugh because it's like, yeah, he used to do this all the time.  And people would buy into him.  Like, they would buy into this hack radio crap.  A fight for a charity?  He did have an audience.  But anyway, go ahead.  He's very angry with you and wants to settle it off the air in a fight.  Right.  Let's have a fight.  Not off the air.  He does want to sell tickets.  Well, to sell tickets in charity. 
[00:42:30]  He wants to find an octagon.  I mean, it's not like just a thing back and forth on the radio.  He wants to literally get physical and punch you.  Who in New York would buy tickets to that?  It would be, you want to get tickets to see Opie fight?  Let me look at the flyer.  Nobody knows you, Bubba, in New York.  No one cares about you.  No one.  So he wants to beat you up.  It would be like a George Foreman fight.  It would be George Foreman and then some dude.  Some guy.  Some guy that just needs a paycheck. 
[00:43:00]  You have to wear one of those, like, 1910 bathing suits to cover his stupid stomach stapling.  Real man's man.  The stripes.  Maybe if you wear a fucking hairnet, you lunch lady stomach.  Douche.  So now he's challenged you.  I remember the last audio we heard, there was a challenge thrown out.  Right.  And I believe I didn't hear any conditions whatsoever put on the challenge.  It was, you name it.  The time, the place, anytime, anywhere, I'll kick your ass. 
[00:43:30]  He said, yeah, he said, you name the place, I will be there.  I will be there.  And then he joked about us only having four or five listeners.  So I'm like, all right, if we only have four or five listeners, well, I know I'm going to be at the Hard Rock Cafe tomorrow for the St. Paddy's Day broadcast from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. on the East Coast.  Get a quick plug in for that.  I'm like, that's where I'm going to be.  That's where I'm going to be, fat boy.  That's where I'm going to be.  Yeah.  So come on.  Bring your posse.  Because there were no conditions, right?  There were no conditions.  As far as I remember, when I listened to his audio, it had nothing. 
[00:44:00]  There were no stipulations, no conditions.  It was, you tell me when and where, and I will come there, and I will kick your ass.  That was it.  So I said, all right, that's where I'm going to be.  All right, here.  Now, this was, what, a couple of days ago?  I guess when it first.  What day were we up to?  Thursday?  I think it might have been Monday.  Thursday.  Today's Thursday.  And there you go.  That was it.  You said, all right, here's where I'm going to be.  Right.  And here's the time, the place.  Come on up.  Right.  Uh, well, I guess he addressed that. 
[00:44:30]  And he's really mad that we're playing his audio on our show, because he knows that we're  just slapping him around and making him look stupid.  That's the only reason you would be mad that someone's playing your audio, by the way.  And first of all, I think he enjoys it, because you got a lot more listeners hearing your  voice on this platform than you do over there.  If you didn't, there'd probably be a C&D here.  Anthony, let's correct that.  A lot more listeners are hearing whatever voices you decide to put on when you put on 
[00:45:00]  your radio person costume.  That can't be a real voice.  What do you want to be for Halloween?  I don't know.  I just want to be a jock.  I want to wrestle for charity.  A man's man.  A man's man.  So here's his response.  I swear this is it.  Yeah.  Holy crap.  This made us laugh so hard in the office about an hour ago.  Had to go off for 15 minutes about, you tell me where and when, I will be there, and I  will kick your ass.  Right.  There were no conditions, no limitations, nothing. 
[00:45:30]  That was, he went on for 15 minutes.  He said, man up.  And then man up.  If you weren't listening to the show, I was screaming into the mic, Friday, I'll be at  the Hard Rock Cafe.  Here you go.  Friday, I'll be at the Hard Rock Cafe.  Right?  Here we go.  This is his response.  And I guess Opie, the one that I hate so bad, has said, well, let me tell you something,  Bubba the Fat Ass.  I'm going to be in Hard Rock Cafe in New York City this Friday night.  We'll see if you show.  Hey, fuck, thanks.  I live in Florida.  I got a kid.  I got a kid.  I got a kid.  Give me a little bit.  I'll tell you what, brother. 
[00:46:00]  Seriously.  We'll send you a plane ticket to come to Tampa.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  I'll be in New York.  I'll tell you when I'll be in New York.  I'll probably be in New York the 24th, 5th, 6th, 7th, and 8th.  I'm not going to be in New York on Friday night.  So me not being at the Hard Rock, ready to take your challenge, doesn't mean that I'm  a pussy.  What happened?  You gave me a two-day notice.  Two-day notice.  It's a two-hour flight, stupid.  We're not in Mogadishu.  Look, it's 1890.  Bubba.  He's got to take a Conestoga wagon up.  I sent out a letter to the guy who he took it on the wagon. 
[00:46:30]  Bubba.  Shit.  Todd, if you will, there's a flight leaving Tampa on JetBlue, which is a fine airline.  I'll say.  Tomorrow morning at 8.15 a.m.  You can be in New York by 10.45 a.m.  It's perfect.  It's perfect for you.  And it's only $229.  Your buddy Howie will probably foot that bill.  No, I'll foot the bill.  He's got a lot of money.  Wow.  Ope's paying for it.  Absolutely.  Come on up.  Absolutely.  You have to order a special meal.  I have a tiny stomach.  I have to eat a special meal. 
[00:47:00]  All vegetables.  It leaves at 8.15 and gets in at 10.45.  All I have to say, if you're calling yourself a man's man, you just show up.  You don't schedule it in your planner.  Let me take out my planner and see what I'm doing Friday.  You good for Thursday?  How am I?  No, I'm booked up.  I got a daycare.  I got to take my kid to it.  Okay, what about a week from this Thursday?  Right.  You're good?  No, no, no. 
[00:47:30]  I got a teeth cleaning.  All right.  I can't.  No, I can't make it there.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Let's just go into June.  Right.  No, I can't because I got to go to the psychologist and find out why I stuffed my fat face for all  those years to the point where I had to have my stomach stapled.  He's a real Viking.  I'm going to rape all the women.  Let me just mark it in my Palm Pilot.  There was no, there were no conditions.  You said no conditions.  Name the time and place.  He did.  What happened?  He talks like a Siemens commercial. 
[00:48:00]  Yeah.  The way he paces and then he talks.  I'll kick your ass as long as it's not this Tuesday.  I thought you were a man's man.  A man's man doesn't have a planner where he has to figure out when he can beat someone's  ass.  A man's man hops on a plane and kicks some ass.  You're right.  Fatso turning your far side calendar while I'm in check.  Oh, shit.  Let me look into my word of the day calendar. 
[00:48:30]  Oh, shit.  Friday's word is pussy.  I'd love to fly out, but I have to do positive affirmations into the mirror.  Oh, shit.  Fucking chicken soup for the change purse stomach.  Look, Bubba or Todd, no offense.  It's been fun, but we're done with you.  We're done with your silliness.  We really are.  I think this is about it.  The real fight is Opie and Anthony versus Howard Stern.  We all know that.  You know that, Todd. 
[00:49:00]  Don't you?  You really do, right?  That's pretty much what the news is writing about.  That's what the trade publications are writing about.  You got a couple of headlines when you joined the little doggy company under Howard's name.  But let's be honest.  No one's really writing about you.  No one.  And it can't be fun to have to mention Howard every ten minutes at least.  But here it is again, his response.  And I guess Opie, the one that I hate so bad, has said,  Well, let me tell you something, Bubba the Fairass.  I'm going to be in Hard Rock Cafe in New York City this Friday night. 
[00:49:30]  We'll see if you show.  Hey, fuck, Vic.  What?  What's wrong with that?  What?  What is wrong with saying that's exactly where I'm going to be?  I know.  It makes it like it's a bad thing.  No.  Good man's man.  And I guess Opie, the one that I hate so bad, has said,  Well, let me tell you something, Bubba the Fairass.  I'm going to be in Hard Rock Cafe in New York City this Friday night.  We'll see if you show.  Hey, fuck, Vic.  I live in Florida.  I got a kid.  I got a kid. 
[00:50:00]  Give me a little bit.  I'll tell you what, brother.  Seriously.  We'll send you a plane ticket to come to Tampa.  No, no, no, no, no.  No, I'll be in New York.  I'll tell you when I'll be in New York.  I'll probably be in New York the 24th, 5th, 6th, 7th, and 8th.  So I'm not going to be in New York on Friday night,  so me not being at the Hard Rock ready to take your challenge  doesn't mean that I'm a pussy, you give me a two-day notice.  And he goes, Maybe I'll be in town.  We're done with you, Bubba.  We're done with you, Todd.  It's going to be hysterical.  He's walking the streets of New York and just gets mugged. 
[00:50:30]  Like a rube.  There's some rube up here.  Yo, man.  You know what time it is?  Which way is north?  Well, I think it's...  How many times a day do you think he pukes  because he's still trying to, you know, stuff his fat face,  but his stomach can't handle it?  Are you accusing him of being bulimic?  It's not that he's bulimic.  He's got a tiny, tiny little stomach now.  Little stomach.  But, you know, he's still trying to forget some kind of memory from the past,  and he's still stuffing his face.  He can't have ice cream anymore,  so every time that uncle flashes in his head, he'll have celery sticks. 
[00:51:00]  Have a celery stick, fat boy.  Well, and here's where it gets really goofy, and then we'll move on.  You know, now he talks about the charity event,  which is just embarrassing if you do this for a living.  Yeah, this is really...  Because this plays right into the whole hack radio thing that we all hate.  Let us know how many days you want off in the hospital.  And let's make it an event,  and let's sell some tickets and give it to a charity,  or for the women's shelter or something,  or let's make it a free event.  By the way, don't fucking matter. 
[00:51:30]  This is the beauty of this dummy.  Let's have a violent fight and donate it to the women's shelter,  or they're getting away from people who beat them up.  What a dope...  What an ass.  Give it to the Battered Women's Association.  We could put a little bit of black eye makeup on and sunglasses  and say we fell and sell tickets to it.  Here's how not to be a hack.  If you want to fight somebody,  if you're actually angry with someone to the point 
[00:52:00]  where you want to beat them up physical violence,  you just do it.  You don't make a radio bit kind of charity thing.  You get together with the person,  and you start throwing some fists.  Opie.  Throwing some fisticuffs.  Well, JetBlue, flight number 854, Anthony.  Leaves tomorrow morning from Tampa, 8.15 a.m.  Arrives in New York City, 10.45 a.m. 
[00:52:30]  The fare is $229,  but someone on the instant feedback makes a really good point.  Am I willing to pay for two seats for this big ass?  Now we're talking...  I have to get the seatbelt extension.  Now we're talking $458, man.  I have to lift the thing between the two seats  and get the extension,  because I can't stop with those molesting memories.  We don't know.  My face was in a pillow.  I was trying to dream about little sheep,  and I can smell whiskey being breathed  into the side of my face. 
[00:53:00]  So I talk in this voice.  When I talk in my real voice, I cry.  It hurt.  Fucking stop talking like Burt Lahr, stupid.  Ah, charity.  Spitting his dumb floor.  Another Florida guy.  Yeah.  What is with that state?  It's great, too,  because you can hear the anger in his voice.  Once again, getting under his skin.  So here's the entire clip about the charity event.  Let's know how many days you want to walk in the hospital.  Let's make it an event,  and let's sell some tickets and give it to a charity 
[00:53:30]  or for the women's shelter or something,  or let's make it a free event.  It don't fucking matter to me.  Then I will bust your fucking skull open,  you little fuck.  Both of you fucks, one and two,  will never work for Howard.  I promise you.  You bunch of dicks.  Probably leaving like the 9th or the 28th,  so let's make it the 24th, 5th, 6th, and 7th.  I'm giving you four days, Anthony.  I mean, Opie.  It'll be like a real modern fucking day Billie Jean video.  I'll bring my crew,  and you bring your crew.  We'll fucking chain our hands together, brother,  and I'll fucking clothesline you. 
[00:54:00]  You're a real man's man.  First of all, that video you're referring to, stupid,  was beat it.  Get the Michael Jackson video straight.  You're going to talk tough,  at least get the tough video right.  Billie Jean was a faggity video.  You couldn't dance on the lip blocks.  Your fat self, you crashed through them.  Not my lover.  We don't want to work for Howard, you fat ass.  Yeah, why make that sound like something 
[00:54:30]  that's going to be bad for us?  And let me tell you,  you'll never work for Howard.  Yeah, we know, because that's...  We don't want to.  We're at the number one satellite radio company,  and we got our own channel.  It doesn't say the Howard Stern channel  when we're broadcasting, buddy boy.  I do not have to go home  with the smell of Howard's asshole on my nose every day.  That's a wonderful thing.  You don't have to sit and talk about  some other guy on the XM platform 
[00:55:00]  every ten minutes,  because he makes you.  Imagine if Bob Edwards  told us that we have to mention him  every ten minutes on his show.  Oh, my God.  Fuck, and the channel will be called  Garlic Around the Window 100?  Boo, let me into the studio.  I need to be invited in.  Why is your hair such a mess?  Like, don't show up in mirrors.  I can't comb it. 
[00:55:30]  You know, the guy's been nothing but nice to us.  Nothing but the greatest ghoul I've ever seen.  Just pick some Transylvania dirt out of your hair  and get on the air, you goose.  He was very excited to meet us.  All we do is shit on him.  I love that immortal.  Don't worry about it.  Yeah, just sleep in a coffin on a satin pillow  and get up and do your show.  There's nothing wrong about the public radio's undead.  You guys will never work for Howard.  Oh, really?  Way to hurt everyone's feelings.  You guys will never block memories  by eating until you throw up. 
[00:56:00]  You guys have self-control.  Todd, you're just silly.  Is that his real name, Todd?  Todd, and he hates being called Todd.  Todd.  It drives him nuts.  Why?  It's a good name.  I actually hate being called Opie,  but I have no choice at this point in my life.  You like being called your regular name.  Yeah, definitely.  He changed it to Bubba the Loves.  It's his legal name.  Yeah.  Probably because people kept going,  oh, dude, that douchey.  Use your real name.  I am.  I changed it.  It is my real name.  No one's talking about you.  Not even the Love Sponge company. 
[00:56:30]  Well, you know what that's about.  That's another ego thing.  Because radio guys in general,  you're not recognized in public.  And, you know.  Oh, wow.  I never even thought of that.  Without a doubt.  Now every time he's got to pull out ID,  hey, guess who I am.  Most radio guys want to be recognized in public.  That's an attention seeker.  And I go about my radio life as Greg Hughes.  And, you know,  every once in a while,  like, wait a minute.  Can your license say Greg Opie Hughes?  No.  It's like, wait a minute.  And then they make the connections sometimes.  And it's cool. 
[00:57:00]  I'm not going to lie to you.  When you get recognized,  it's definitely a cool thing.  But I also want to live, like,  in the real world.  And I guarantee that's what that's about.  That's a good point.  Where wherever he goes,  it's like,  you're Bubba the Love Sponge?  You're, oh, wow.  Yeah, hey, look at that ID.  He's got to feed this ego.  At the airport when you've got to show your ID.  Oh, hey.  Because why else would you want to walk around  your entire life as Bubba the Love Sponge?  Unless you want attention.  Because you don't get it normally.  Bubba the Love Sponge. 
[00:57:30]  Well, I think we're through.  I think that's about it.  I want to be like a Love Something,  because that's always funny.  Catty Jimmy.  Yeah, but I want a the in it.  It's got to be a the.  So we're done.  We're done, Todd.  You can spit it in however you want on your show,  but you said you're going to fight me.  Just name the place and the time.  And I did.  A time and place was named.  And I did.  And unfortunately,  it doesn't mesh with your schedule.  I got a kid.  I got a kid.  Who cares?  Be a man's man.  Leave the kid to fucking itself for a couple of days. 
[00:58:00]  Right.  That's right.  A man's man leaves his kid in a room with a bunch of pizza.  That's right.  Chain it by its genitals to the radiator  and leave some water and food.  Howie ain't giving you enough money for a nanny or something?  Watch that kid while you're kicking ass?  What's the matter?  I got to water my azaleas.  Who's going to take care of my orchid?  And I guarantee he's listening right now.  And he's just pacing around.  And there's nothing you can do, Todd.  That's right.  Nothing.  Two steps and sit, 
[00:58:30]  because you haven't exercised since 1980.  Staple belly.  Oh, help me out surgery,  because I can't do it.  Oh, I just couldn't keep my fat hands out of a treat box.  Jimmy.  Keep your little fat fingers.  What kind of an asshole?  What are you talking about?  That's the exception.  I'm not talking about Steve.  Just everyone else who's had that done,  but not him.  Well, Steve's not talking shit,  and Steve talks in his real voice, 
[00:59:00]  and therefore I love Steve.  That is real voice?  As awful as that is,  that is the way Steve talks all the time.  He's going to come in here and kick your ass.  Why?  I'm saying I'm defending Steve.  You're an awful attack.  Did they put his muzzle on this morning  so he can't bite Jimmy?  Yeah.  When Jimmy goes to the bathroom,  he nips at his leg.  He hates Romanians.  Every time he seems Romanians,  and there's music,  he just dances in a circle in the street,  and he doesn't know why.  I liked the other day  when we had him on a unicycle.  That was cute.  Oh, no.  Here he comes.  Here he comes.  Oh, no. 
[00:59:30]  Oh, no.  I didn't say a bad word about you, Steve.  I didn't.  You didn't say anything?  Not at all.  Because I like you.  I said that you actually talk in your real voice.  Yeah.  But I do.  I know.  I know you do.  Actually, I wasn't saying it sarcastically.  Hey, Steve,  we have audio of the Greg and Tony show  theme karaoke version  that's now up on the website.  Yeah, it's on the website, 
[01:00:00]  and I can pull the audio for you.  Yeah, Pappy sent in a karaoke version  of his infamous Greg and Tony show theme.  Oh, Pappy.  And there's a video to it now.  Yeah, I guess it came from some obscure,  one of those Bollywood kind of movies,  and that's where he got it from,  so he just synced up the words.  The text version to the video.  It's actually pretty funny.  You've got to check it out.  Is it linked on opianthony.com?  It certainly is.  What else you got up there  that I haven't talked about in a while, Steve?  Let's see.  We got the...  Jim Norton Black Sabbath photo, right?  The Jim Norton Black Sabbath photo. 
[01:00:30]  We got an Uncle Junior remix  that Gatsada Malenga,  whatever he said,  is now making the rounds as a video clip  because nobody knows what the hell that means,  so people are making video mashups now,  putting the word out there,  trying to figure out.  Any words playing today?  Might be.  Might be.  It's a little bit confusing without the video,  so you have to sort of make sure.  We got very creative listeners,  very creative.  And then you got Greg Valentino  cutting open his own infected bicep.  We talked about that.  Oh, Greg Valentino.  Yeah, the bodybuilder who was putting some...  Yeah, the world's largest biceps.  If you Google his name, 
[01:01:00]  the pictures are unbelievable.  That's not Photoshop.  That's how he used to look.  It's a TLC special.  Apparently, he was using a combination  of steroids and this oil  that bodybuilders use  to puff up their muscles,  and he was using dirty needles,  and it got infected.  And it's a video of him  trying to slice open his own bicep  and drain out the pus.  Right.  What an ass.  Oh, yeah.  Dummy.  All right.  What else is on the old website?  We've got plenty of new boobies  on the Rate My Wow thing.  Yeah, the Rate My Wow thing  is really starting to take off.  At first, no offense to the ladies  that gave their pictures early on. 
[01:01:30]  Ugh.  Ugh.  Yeah.  Some were real trainwax.  But the quality is way up there now.  Vastly improved.  And every other day,  we get a new boob photo.  I saw a nice one last night.  She wowed the crowd.  Hootie McBoo from PalTalk showed up,  and she has fucking fantastic bosoms.  She's on PalTalk every morning,  isn't she?  Big juicy areolas.  Yeah.  Uh, Than, why aren't you  keeping your camera up?  Why not?  Queer.  You know, I...  I hate tits.  I noticed E-Rock  would always have  the camera running.  Of course he would. 
[01:02:00]  But now I'm looking,  I don't see your camera.  Um...  What happened?  What?  That's right.  Just take...  Take Steve's mic.  I like that.  Yeah.  Good boy, Than.  Well, um,  My PalTalk has frozen.  Oh.  Here.  Got to reboot during commercial.  Okay.  Yes.  All right.  All right, why don't we  step aside for a little while?  Can't wait for tomorrow's broadcast.  It's going to be a lot of fun  at the Hard Rock Cafe.  Oh, yeah.  While you guys are having fun here,  I'm going to be in Atlanta  doing my dumb gig,  and I find out I got to do  live remotes,  two of them in the morning,  because everyone's doing  live remotes.  Ooh, where?  I don't know.  Oh, you're doing radio down there? 
[01:02:30]  I have to do it  for promoting the gig a little bit.  I mean, just local radio  and fucking...  Just a couple of morning rock stations.  Why can't we just do local radio  to promote our gig, Opie?  Shouldn't we do that?  You don't need to.  I mean, Jimmy does.  You are a local radio.  We actually have...  I don't think we have to do that anymore.  We have a really big audience  over here at XM.  I think it'd be fun, though,  to try to book us on a radio show.  I would love to hear  how Howard's spinning that,  by the way.  That's the reason he's going on  show and everything else.  He doesn't have an audience  that's big enough to talk to yet.  There's no audience over there.  My God. 
[01:03:00]  Stop already.  All right.  Stop trying to spin it.  Steve.  Nope.  By saying nope,  he means yes.  He certainly does.  You got him for a second.  He didn't turn,  but his stomach did.  It went, huh?  Hey, let's say hi to Craig  in Atlanta.  Craig?  Hey.  What's up, Craig?  Hey, man.  I'm like,  I just wanted to call  and tell you that  me and my friends  will be proudly sitting  in the front row  of the punchline  tonight to see  Mr. Norton himself.  Oh, that's very cool, man. 
[01:03:30]  Yeah, Jimmy's at the punchline  in Atlanta all weekend long.  Yeah, man.  We're looking forward to it.  But somehow they told us  we got golden circle seats.  Does that mean  that Norton's going to piss on us?  Golden circle seats.  That means that  those are seats  that I believe  are kind of close to the stage.  And what I do at the end,  it's a very funny bit.  It's a musical parody thing  where I give myself an enema  and I spin in the circle  and I shit as far as I can  into the audience.  It's called the old,  it's called the duty copter.  Enjoy.  And I raffle those shitty clothes 
[01:04:00]  off for charity  for a woman's shelter.  Let's give it,  let's give it some helpful kids  who've been hurting car accidents.  That the fuck up.  Exactly.  You know what I give  to the women's shelter?  I put my fist up  and I give them one of these.  A knuckle sandwich.  Wow.  All right, thank you.  All right, put it down, boys.  Maybe if they know  how to listen.  That's right.  Why don't you give  hearing aids  to the women's charity?  They have a roof  over their head still.  Maybe they wouldn't be  provoking people. 
[01:04:30]  Old fat lip club.  We'll be nice  and give them  a second chance.  That's right.  Let's give them a book  that says pay attention  or the NHL game  play by play on XM.  This is the Opie and Anthony program. 
[01:05:00]  Thanks for checking us out today.  We definitely appreciate it.  We got Francine in the office.  Yeah.  And I guess she's trying  to get her own show  on this channel.  Who isn't?  We're starting to get  people's shows, I guess.  Yeah.  Patrice did a great job  last Saturday.  He's going to do it again  this Saturday night, 
[01:05:30]  8 to 10 p.m.  East Coast time.  His relationship show.  He just has a good take  on things.  He certainly does have a take.  I don't know if it's good.  It's unique.  He can't use his advice  in the real world,  but it's still fun  to listen to.  I heard Jamaican Mike  when I went down  to the garage  was talking about  he was listening  to Patrice's show  and he goes,  you cannot back him  into a corner.  He's got an answer  for everything.  He certainly does.  Except for Patrice,  why don't you love yourself? 
[01:06:00]  There's no answer.  No answer?  No.  Hey, we got Autumn Ashante.  Is that her name?  Yes.  This is the latest controversy.  The latest racial controversy.  It's hard to call her racist,  though.  She is seven.  Seven years old.  Well, you know something?  Where is she learning  this shit from, though?  Exactly.  At seven years old.  The adorable Prussian blue girls  are young, too.  The only difference is this.  What?  There's 13.  There's 13.  There's two of them.  They started out at seven, 
[01:06:30]  I'm sure.  I'm only saying  that this kid's not small.  He's seven.  You have to be told  stuff at seven.  You don't understand that stuff.  Well, they were told  stuff, too.  Did you see the upbringing  the Prussian blue have?  Yeah.  They were told  by their mother.  And their mother  raised those girls  in a very racist environment.  And that's what they're doing.  And they get chastised for it  as being young little racists  and black leaders  and Jewish leaders  come out against them,  which, that's fine. 
[01:07:00]  You know, what they're spouting  is hate.  But there's a double standard here.  Adorable racist.  How come?  They call them a racist.  Yeah.  Well, that woman there,  I like her column.  It worked.  You know, she said,  hey, you reap what you sow.  And the father,  this is the beautiful thing.  She writes this.  The poem is actually  not that bad.  I don't mind.  Yes, it is.  Shut up.  It's all right.  It's not bad.  The only problem I have  is that she had to leave  students in a recitation  of Black Child's Pledge  by Shirley Williams.  And then she asked  the white students  to sit while the black 
[01:07:30]  students stood.  Yeah.  And I just wish,  and they did issue  an apology like the school.  She's a fucking separatist,  which is no different  than a white supremacist.  Or anybody in certain  Long Island neighborhoods.  Right.  And the father,  to answer,  the school district apologized  and said it was wrong  and he called them  racist crackers.  Yep.  Let's see,  let's see what would have  happened if those girls'  fathers,  the Prussian girls,  if the school objected  and he goes,  ah, well,  they're just a bunch of niggers.  Right.  Let's see,  the media would have been,  oh my God, 
[01:08:00]  you fucking groveling  cowards in the media,  why don't you call  the father out  for being a racist?  Yep.  The seven-year-old  is an easy racial target  because she's seven.  Exactly.  So she's not really a racist.  We all know that.  She's being told that.  Right.  She doesn't know.  She's seven.  So jump on the parents.  Jump on the parents,  you shitheads.  Fucking cowards.  Daily News.  Fucking,  the Daily News,  do they mention it at all?  I don't even know.  Fat Nick was on the cover  of this stupid thing  because of the racial implication.  Oh,  when him and his buddy 
[01:08:30]  beat up the car thieves  in their neighborhood?  Exactly.  Yeah.  Oh,  that's not the story.  No.  Jesus,  Jimmy.  Oh my God.  I thought it was.  Those,  what do you call them,  bunch of crackers?  Yeah.  Crackers and what?  It's just so easy  for blacks  to get away with  being racist like that  because they say  they can't be racist.  Exactly.  They don't have the power base.  Yeah,  because race,  but they can be bigots.  Yeah.  Bigots,  okay?  Stop with the fucking semantics, 
[01:09:00]  you apologist douchebags.  They can't be racist  because they don't have  the economic fund.  Shut up!  Stop.  So then those two girls  aren't racist.  The two white girls  aren't racist.  They're bigoted.  Yeah.  We got the entire poem  in the paper?  Yeah,  the poem is in the paper.  All right,  well first,  let's go to the audio.  Here's the story  for the rest of the country  in case it didn't hit your town.  Oh,  believe me,  this is national.  Seven-year-old  Autumn Ashanti  has performed poetry  in front of audiences  since she was four  and is very comfortable 
[01:09:30]  doing so.  Because I know  there's a lot of  happy faces there  and so I just do it.  She is also comfortable  reciting the poem  called  White Nationalism  which she wrote herself.  White Nationalism  is what puts you  in bondage.  Pirates and vampires  like Columbus,  Morgan and Darwin.  The poem goes on  to condemn  the oppression  of slavery  with more sharp words  for the likes  of Christopher Columbus,  J.P. Morgan  and Charles Darwin. 
[01:10:00]  Black lands  taken from your hands  by vampires  with no remorse.  Audiences at both  Pinkskill High School  and the town's  middle school  heard Autumn  recite the poem  last month.  Someone's so angry  the way she presented it  which, you know,  acting-wise  is what she did  but, you know,  the way it was perceived  a lot of people  took offense to it  probably.  Controversy  followed the performance  and the school district  disavowed  the seven-year-old  in phone messages  to parents.  But Chantal Peoples 
[01:10:30]  was not offended.  We live in a culturally  diverse community  and I think she certainly  added an element  to a black history program  that was maybe  a little different  but I think it was  certainly well received  and as a parent  I wasn't upset at all.  Autumn's father  has raised a white girl  by himself.  I'm really, really proud  of her  and I will encourage  her to continue  to do what she does  not to be offensive  not to be rude.  I feel confused  and a little sad  because of what it might  do to my career  but  career?  They're just making  a big fuss about 
[01:11:00]  a poem.  Yeah.  She's right.  You know what?  You're seven  and you're right.  Can we start by saying  the poem stinks?  I disagree.  I don't think it's bad  for a seven-year-old.  Vampires.  Vampires.  Did you see what I really  had when I was 18?  That's better.  She's 11 years ahead of me  and she's seven.  Man,  you understand?  The father I have a problem with  and that twat black parent  that's racially diverse.  Stop thinking.  She'd be the first one  jumping down the throats  of the school district  if there was a  white person there 
[01:11:30]  that was doing poetry  that offended black people  they'd be all over it  calling for  the resignation  of school officials  and there would be  marches and everything.  Stop thinking  of yourselves  as second-class citizens  and stop thinking  of black people  as fucking  little children  who need their hands held.  Hold people  to the same level  of accountability.  She's seven.  Fuck her.  How about the parents?  Why the separatism?  Why the separatism  between black and white  like this? 
[01:12:00]  I don't care.  Fucking preach it.  Go ahead.  Just don't have  a double standard.  No double standard with it.  The poem is fine.  She's right.  Columbus pretty much  was a rapist  who took lands.  It's my ancestors  you're talking about there.  Oh, no.  He was all right.  He's not a very good compass, man.  Did he actually take  fucking land  from black people, though?  Columbus?  I think it was the Indians  that he raped.  Get your genocide straight,  kiddo.  J.P. Morgan?  What did he do?  Wasn't she a judge 
[01:12:30]  on the gong show?  What the hell did she do?  Did she gong a black artist?  Yeah.  Mean Gene  the Dancing Machine.  Yeah, yeah.  Gene Gene the Dancing Machine  was black  and he was fine.  She didn't like  Mean Gene  the Dancing Machine.  Gene Gene.  Was it Gene Gene?  It was probably Mean Gene  after they cut his legs off  for the diabetes  and he couldn't dance anymore.  Then I think he got  a little mean.  It really was Gene Gene  the Dancing Machine?  It was Gene Gene  the Dancing Machine.  Yeah.  Wow, we just went  old school for everybody.  She's actually,  to be very honest, 
[01:13:00]  if she wrote this  and understands the meaning,  she's a genius  at seven years old.  To comprehend these words  at seven,  you're a genius.  I think she had  a little help  from some family members.  That's Daddy the Racist.  Maybe, but listening  to her talk,  she's a bright kid.  I mean, you know.  So, come on,  Rudy would recite lines  on the Cosby Show  and unoffensive lines,  mind you,  with just as much oomph.  Unoffensive?  Two black people,  one a lawyer,  one a doctor?  I don't think so.  Not in my hometown.  Godspeed.  That was the best  science fiction 
[01:13:30]  I ever watched.  What planet  did that show  take place on?  That's right.  The planet,  oh, okay.  On Earth 2.  In Bizarro World,  that might work.  The only problem  I have with Autumn.  It's just a joke.  Of course.  She commanded  white students  to remain seated  as she led  black students.  That's the only problem  I had.  What the hell  is that about?  What is with  the white students  listening?  She's seven,  you shitheads.  You listen to  a seven-year-old  that says  stay seated,  white people?  And what did  the Sicilians do? 
[01:14:00]  Take a knee?  Come on now.  That was self-deprecating.  It was funny.  And it was viciously true.  I wouldn't even  car crash on that one.  Yeah, I kind of liked it.  I got nothing.  It was terrific.  The car crash  doesn't know.  If it hears silence,  I have it on automatic now.  It just goes.  I was more enjoying  the great brilliance  of that joke.  Thank you, Jimmy.  Because it implies  that the Sicilians,  great-great-great-grandmother,  well, we know  what happened.  It just reminds me  that I just hate poems. 
[01:14:30]  How did they say poem?  Poetry.  It's poems.  Poem.  I don't care if the proper...  It's a poem.  I don't care if the proper  pronunciation is poem.  I say poem.  We got to take it back.  Oh, look at that.  Look at that, Anthony.  That doesn't happen  that often on this post.  Very rare.  Yes.  Enough with Black History Month.  Yeah.  Enough with needing  the separate recognition.  Enough already.  Stop holding blacks  to a separate set of standards, 
[01:15:00]  you fucking condescending  white people.  Well, that seems to be the...  What page is that woman's article on  in the post?  33.  Where's the poem?  33.  Where's the poem?  I have it right here.  The poem.  Anthony's going to read  the entire poem.  Oh, I am.  I'm going to actually read this  from my balcony.  Adorable racist.  Look at her.  She's not too adorable.  She looks very angry.  You can't even tell  what gender she is 
[01:15:30]  with that stupid hat.  She looks like she's starring  in Cooley High.  All right, let's see  if we can figure this out.  White nationalism  put you in bondage.  No, it put you in bondage.  Bondage.  Oh, do I have to do it  like she did?  White nationalism  is what put you in bondage.  Pirate and vampires  like Columbus,  Morgan, and Darwin  drank the blood of the sheep, 
[01:16:00]  trampled all over them  with steel,  tricks,  and deceit.  Nothing has changed  to take...  Shit.  Nothing has changed  take a look in our streets.  The mis-education  of she and hero  leaves...  No, read it.  What?  You can't read the words  of a seven-year-old.  He-gro.  That's not a word!  Maybe it's a name.  What is he-gro?  It might be a name.  Of she and he-gro. 
[01:16:30]  Oh, no, that's what  black people say  when they see someone  who's gotten taller.  Leaves you  on your knee  to grow.  What the...  What does that mean?  It's awful.  Stop it.  This shit's horrid.  Black lands  taken from your hands  by vampires  with no remorse.  They took the gold,  the wisdom,  and all the storytellers...  What?  They took the black women  with the black men weak,  made to watch 
[01:17:00]  as they changed  the paradigum.  What?  That's how you say that.  Paradigum.  Paradigum.  Paradigum.  Of our village.  They killed the blind.  Paradigum.  Paradigum.  Parad...  Parad...  Paradigum.  Parad...  You know that word,  don't you?  Paradigum.  Yeah, I know the word.  I can't say it.  Paradigm. 
[01:17:30]  Parad...  Paradigm.  Paradigm.  Paradigm is  P-A-R-A-D-I-M-E.  You would know.  Paradigm.  Yeah, right.  That's saying corrected.  Of our village.  They killed the blind.  They killed the lazy.  They went  so far as to  kill the unborn baby.  Who?  What?  Yeah, we're not the ones  getting abortions  every 20 minutes.  Right.  Wink, wink.  Check out that neighborhood.  Yeah, white nationalism  is what put you in bondage.  Pirates and vampires  like Columbus,  Morgan, and Darwin.  Pirates and vampires?  They drank the blood  of the sheep,  trampled all over them 
[01:18:00]  with...  She had to go back  to the fucking chorus.  Steel laden feet.  Throw in the tricks.  Alcohol and deceit.  Like, oh, we give  the liquor stores  in the neighborhood.  Is that it?  That complaint  that black people have  that we build liquor stores  in their neighborhood  to keep them drunk?  Yes.  Sell guns in the neighborhood  to keep them shooting each other?  Sell tobacco  to keep them out of getting cancer?  Don't forget about the crack.  And the crack?  Yeah, the white member  brought the crack in.  Is it black people  bringing cocaine  into this country?  I don't think so.  We don't have no planes.  We can't afford the planes.  We can't afford the ships. 
[01:18:30]  Yeah, you can afford the coke.  You certainly can afford  the big fucking furry jackets  and those awful hats  in a Rolls Royce.  Jesus Christ.  A lot of conspiracy theories  in the hood.  Nothing has changed.  Take a look in our streets.  Here's what changed.  The fact that Kizzy  had to hide the fact  that she could read  and here you are reading  poems when you're seven.  I'd say that's  a big improvement.  Yeah, true.  She led Black Child's Pledge  by Black Panther  Shirley Williams  which reads in part,  I pledge allegiance 
[01:19:00]  to my black people.  I pledge to develop my mind  and my body  to the greatest extent possible.  I will learn all that I can  in order to give my best  to my people  in their struggle  for liberation.  I will discipline myself  to direct my energies  thoughtfully and constructively  rather than wasting them  on idle hatred.  I will train myself  never to hurt  or allow others  to harm my brothers  and sisters.  No, my black brothers  and sisters.  My black brothers and sisters.  And capitalize black  the way Shirley did. 
[01:19:30]  Right, my black brothers  and sisters.  These principles  I pledge to practice daily  and teach them  to others  in order to unite  my people.  One's father condemning.  Blessed are those.  Yeah.  Well, there you go.  Which one is your wallet?  The one that says  young motherfucker.  You know,  it's a complete double standard. 
[01:20:00]  It is.  And it's angering.  But this woman,  Michelle Malkin  in the Post  did a pretty good job.  Even she doesn't attack  the parents though.  Well, she doesn't  but she goes,  who's surprised  if you set aside  a separate holiday  for black people  month in public schools?  You set aside  separate graduation ceremonies,  college dorms,  academic departments,  recruiting programs,  government contracts,  subcontracts by race.  You send a message  that hardcore racial separatism  is not only acceptable  but desired.  And it says,  Ashanti is a natural offspring 
[01:20:30]  of militant multiculturalism  and government sanctioned  identity politics.  We reap what we sow.  And there you go.  It's just another way  of fucking giving blacks  handouts that they don't need  and it really is another way  of fucking keeping blacks  as second class citizens.  And what annoys me  is when black people  don't see it.  It's like,  how do you not fucking  see the paternalism?  There are black people  that see it  and they are looked at  as Uncle Toms  and sellouts  because they have assimilated 
[01:21:00]  to not white society,  to American society.  They work for a living.  It's not all about  just black pride  and separatism.  It's about earning  a living in this country  and making something yourself  no matter what color you are.  And those are the people  that see the opportunity  in the country  and they're called Uncle Toms  and sellouts  and chastised  by the black community.  I hate to have to follow her  at Deaf Poetry Gym.  You know how they jump up and down  and just cause a big to-do?  Oh my God. 
[01:21:30]  God forbid it to just be  a polite standing ovation  like the rest of society.  Arr! Arr!  Fucking jumping  and clapping and yelling.  Tables and chairs  flying against the walls.  Yeah, it's really awful  luggage going around.  Let's change subjects.  Let's go to Nick in Jersey.  Nick, what's up?  What's up, buddy?  Hey.  Sorry to get off the blacks,  but we got an upskirt beaver  sighting on page 43  of the Daily News.  You nailed it.  I hope he brought this up  in the office.  I can explain the picture perfectly.  It's something about  girls getting,  underage people 
[01:22:00]  getting drunk in Ireland.  Yep.  And they have a,  it looks like a Catholic schoolgirl.  She's got the little skirt.  She's passed out  with her friends around her  and they got a,  they got an upskirt shot  of her little,  of her little panties.  Nice.  Good find, good find.  And the Daily News  knows exactly what they're doing  by printing that picture.  Of course.  You don't think they had  other pictures to choose from?  And they go,  go with the up the skirt.  They had a hundred pictures  to choose from,  but they said  this is the best one  for this story.  Perfect fit. 
[01:22:30]  All right.  Very good, Nick.  Just making sure  we're on the same page, guys.  See you later.  Always, always.  We certainly are.  Vampires.  Excellent.  Vampires.  Shouldn't she just be playing  with her Barbie dolls?  Absolutely.  The white ones.  Her white Barbie doll.  Let's go to Joe in Philly.  Joe, what's up?  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  Hey, Joe.  How do you do, Joe?  I'm doing all right.  I'm not sure.  I might have missed it,  whatever,  but I don't know  if you guys ever talked  about the Miss Teen Texas 
[01:23:00]  that, or Miss,  I'm sorry, Miss Deaf Teen Texas  that was struck by a train  as she was walking on the tracks.  And why would,  I don't get this one.  The greatest story.  I mean, we talk about it  every once in a while.  Where's the story?  They said she was like  text messing or whatever,  but still, I mean,  what the fuck are these people thinking?  You know,  if I'm deaf,  I'm just going to stay away  from trains.  Stay away from train tracks.  Like we've said before.  If you know the train track  will tell you the exact  route of the train,  I would still,  you know what,  just stay away from it.  We've said it before. 
[01:23:30]  Trains never hit people  off the track.  You pretty much have to be  on or near the train tracks  for a train to ever hit you.  And if you're deaf,  why would you be walking?  Why take that chance?  Inside the track itself.  Because really,  the only way you know  if it's going to hit you,  unless you could feel  the vibration,  is hearing  choo-choo.  If you can't hear  choo-choo,  stay away from the tracks.  So you know she has  a great ass.  The conductor probably  just had that fat, 
[01:24:00]  juicy ass getting  closer and closer.  It's like, well,  maybe toot the horn.  Well, here's the story.  Train kills deaf beauty queen.  A teen beauty  who won a pageant  last year  as Miss Deaf Texas,  died after being  struck by a train.  Tara Rose McAvoy,  18,  was walking Monday  near railroad tracks  when she was struck  by a Union Pacific train.  Do you hang up on this guy?  It was not clear  if her death  was an accident  or suicide.  Oh!  It might have been suicide.  But she won Miss Deaf team. 
[01:24:30]  Why would she  want to kill herself?  You're on a pageant,  but that's what I mean.  That I don't get dead.  Holy shit, Jimmy.  Oh, that train  are coming.  Anthony, remember?  Oh, I'm not bad.  That reminds me  of the comedian  we interviewed in L.A.  Oh, she was awful.  What's the deaf comedian's name?  She was famous  for like a year.  Not the one.  Ten minutes.  I don't know.  Marlee Maitland?  No. 
[01:25:00]  No, no.  Jerry?  Oh, she's a palsy hand.  It was a stand-up.  Who knows?  She was famous  for like a year or two.  Well, listen to her.  I wouldn't.  I was being the deaf comedian  and she would do jokes  about being deaf and stuff.  I can't hear.  Yeah, you can't?  Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh.  Well, we were in L.A.  at the comedy store  and we were interviewing  all these people  and she came by 
[01:25:30]  and she just annoyed me  on a level I can't even explain  because she was using like...  Sat down and did her act.  She was doing her act  and it was all hacky jokes  about being deaf and stuff  and I'm just like...  Don't beepin' at me.  What did I like  to be a deaf comedian?  What?  No one asks you that.  No one.  They go,  tell her to shut up  because her voice  sounds like a muted operator.  It's uncomfortable.  No one cares  why you're a deaf comedian.  It's uncomfortable to watch.  Here's why you're a deaf comedian  because you can't hear  and you need attention.  Next question.  So I'm like,  you know,  this just stinks 
[01:26:00]  and the radio was going really bad  because it was just like  it wasn't our cup of tea.  Yeah.  So I just decided  to turn around  and start asking her questions.  Facing away?  Opie faced away  because she could read lips  but you really,  you had to kind of,  you know,  So I would ask these,  you know,  these questions  as I was turned around  and they were,  you know,  pretty good questions  for radio  and then you would just hear  silence  because she didn't know  I asked her questions.  Wait,  what Opie was saying to her.  And it made me just laugh  like an idiot.  She had the headphones on? 
[01:26:30]  Just to try to be like  the other kids?  I don't think she did.  I don't remember anymore.  Why would you?  I don't think I've only done these.  You manage it.  I won't mess my hair up.  I won't mess up my hair up.  Yeah,  that's an advantage,  all right.  Sure is.  Just look at that iPod  like it's a funny box,  stupid.  Can we get her act?  I'm sure it's in Dillette.  We got to get her name  and we got to get her act now.  You think she's on  one of the XM comedy channels?  She was famous for like,  like I said,  a year or two.  I haven't heard from her in a while.  Bobby in Georgia.  She hasn't heard from anybody in years. 
[01:27:00]  Bobby,  what's wrong,  boy?  Hey.  Hey,  Jimmy with a Y.  Hi,  Mommy.  Hey,  listen,  back when I was in college,  there was a train track  right by the apartments  we lived in  and a little retarded fella  got caught on the trussle  and needless to say  the train killed him.  On the what?  On the train track,  on the trussle.  You know,  it's like the big tall part  that goes over a creek  or whatever.  And he got stuck  on the trussle  because the train's coming.  Needless to say,  the little retarded fella 
[01:27:30]  got hit by the train  and killed him.  Oh,  yeah.  The worst part of it was  is I had a fraternity brother  who worked at the funeral home  and he was asking me  about that,  the train wreck  and he said,  man,  you're not going to believe this.  Right in the middle  of the funeral service,  the funeral home  sat on the train tracks  itself.  Oh,  boy.  right in the middle  of the funeral service  you hear,  hurr,  hurr,  and the people  just lost it.  Yeah,  I bet they,  uh,  they started weeping.  They weeped profusely. 
[01:28:00]  How do you think  the train fell  when that fucking head  hit it?  It'd come apart like that.  We got it.  Kathy Buckley.  Kathy Buckley?  I don't know.  Is she related to Spuds?  Kathy Buckley.  Do we have any Kathy Buckley?  We're looking for Kathy Buckley?  We're looking for Kathy.  This is Kathy Buckley.  I'm doing a report  from a gas station  in Buffalo.  All right.  There's no proof.  My friend is Spuds.  There's no proof  that I was ever  Spuds Buckley.  You were Spuds Buckley.  Prove it. 
[01:28:30]  Let me ask you a question.  Prove it.  You probably weren't  Spuds Buckley.  Prove it.  How would Spuds Buckley  have talked?  I don't know.  Just guess.  I'm asking you to guess.  It might have sounded  a little like,  uh,  Jerry Lewis.  Oh,  like,  ah,  Spuds Buckley.  Oh.  I would like to hear  some impressions.  That's how I would  picture it in my head.  If you had to be a guy  that Spuds,  not that you would be,  but how would he have sounded?  How would you  impersonate him?  Go ahead.  Thank God back in those days  no one gave a shit  I was on the radio  and they weren't taping  our shows like they do 
[01:29:00]  on a daily basis now.  Yeah.  So there's no tape  that actually exists  of Spuds Buckley.  I'm sure he doesn't exist,  but I'm saying  what would your guess be  if you had to guess?  I really,  I'm really not that creative.  I don't know  what would sound.  Yeah,  come on.  It's not worse  than Monster Rain.  Come on,  I'm just wondering  what he might have  sounded like.  Just a guess.  I will dig through  some old radio boxes  and see if I can find  some Spuds Buckley.  We've been hearing this  since 1990.  I'm sorry,  1990,  yeah,  2000.  You're not going to dig 
[01:29:30]  through it.  Why don't you just,  I only want an impression.  Just a quick,  a guess of what you might think.  I gotta tell you,  my voice has changed.  I just can't do it.  You never had to do it  because there was no Spuds.  I'm just saying,  what would your impression be?  It wouldn't do it justice  for me to try to do something.  Really?  You couldn't not do it justice.  What would Spuds sound like now?  We could kind of  just make like it was higher.  I'm not going there.  Just close your eyes  and pretend to be nice.  I'm here.  Let's go now  to Spuds Buckley.  He's down at the gas station. 
[01:30:00]  We're giving out free gas  for the first 100 people  that pull up to the pub.  Spuds,  how's it going down there?  Well,  Godfather,  it wasn't the God,  it was the Bear Man show.  Oh,  well,  Bear Man,  or Roar.  Roar.  Grr,  grr.  Shut up.  Merry Christmas,  baby.  Tonight,  I'm going to  deck your horse  and sing you a lullaby.  Check it out.  He doesn't sound deaf enough. 
[01:30:30]  Exactly.  Oh,  the guy's deaf?  Yeah,  listen.  Holy in peace  Oh,  do you have one note?  Sounds like Hartman a little. 
[01:31:00]  Sleep in heavenly peace  Sleep in heavenly peace  Sam brought this in.  Of course he did.  Wow,  Sam.  Sam used to intern  for our radio program.  He now goes to school  at,  what,  Syracuse University?  Yeah.  And he works for  the Kingdom of Nakedness.  Kingdom of Nakedness.  The Naked Militia. 
[01:31:30]  Naked Militia now.  The Naked Militia.  The Naked Militia.  It'll always be  the Kingdom of Nakedness.  Scorch.  You intern for Scorch  up there in Syracuse.  And this is audio  of a Christmas album  sung by Def Jeff.  Def Jeff is the producer  of the morning show  up there  on Hot 107,  which is the Top 40 station.  It's right next door  to Scorch's studio.  But yeah,  they were giving this CD out.  There's a couple,  if you want to hear,  he really sounds deaf.  He does a couple rap numbers.  Is he trying to be funny?  Or is he really deaf?  No,  he's deaf.  He's definitely really deaf.  Does he know he sucks? 
[01:32:00]  I think he does.  He should.  But this is,  this is,  this doesn't even suck  in a good way though.  Yeah,  it just sucks.  He put it out.  He's not deaf enough.  It's an actual CD  that he put out?  Yeah,  they put,  they gave these CDs  out for Christmas.  Listen to me,  Mike Brady hair  in the last season.  He has the later  Mike Brady hair.  Last season of his life?  No,  that'd be wispy.  And fucking,  all mushed on one side  from sleeping. 
[01:32:30]  Reeking of chicken broth.  Let's,  let's go to Pat in Buffalo.  Pat?  Pat?  Hey,  Opie,  I hate to burst your bubble,  but according to your pals  Shred and Reagan,  there is Spuds Buckley  out there.  There's some audio  in existence  of you doing Spuds Buckley.  Well,  a little known fact,  Shred from the Shred and Reagan  show in Buffalo  is a very good friend of mine.  We go way back  and he used to be  the producer  of Bear Man Show  and he's saying  there may be  some Spuds Buckley audio.  Oh,  that would be 
[01:33:00]  a dream come true.  Nah,  Spuds Buckley.  And we're going now,  let's hear from  Spuds Buckley.  Spuds,  how you doing now?  Hey,  pretty good Bear Man.  How's it going up there  in the cave?  I'm here,  gasoline.  All I have to say  is if any Spuds  Buckley audio  arrives here  at the XM facility,  it will be destroyed  by me.  Oh,  no.  Address it to  Ben Sparks,  Ben Sparks,  and then say on the note,  Spuds Buckley audio. 
[01:33:30]  Yeah.  All right,  Pat.  I can call you guys back.  They're letting the lobster  loose in 15 minutes  on 97 Rock.  Oh,  yes.  Oh,  yes.  Let's do that today.  Another big one.  We love when they let the lobster loose.  What happens?  I get scared.  It's a gag that's been going on  for how long on this guy's show?  I don't like the Benchman.  It's Snortin' Norton.  Snortin' Norton,  I think his name is.  I'm Snortin' Norton.  Another Snortin'  Catty Jimmy Norton.  Another fuck.  Is he a fuck?  He's on the fuck-o list.  Norton's on the fuck-o list. 
[01:34:00]  He's been in Buffalo Radio forever.  Yeah.  Was never good enough  to get past  the one market sensation thing.  Right.  And every once in a while  he gets interviewed  and then he brags  that I used to intern for him.  Did you?  Brags about that?  When we both worked at WCMF  in Rochester.  I never interned  for Snortin' Norton.  What did you do?  I never even interned  at WCMF.  Spuds Buckley did, though.  I was hired.  I was making  less than $12,000 a year.  I was an actual employee  and I never interned for him. 
[01:34:30]  But he'll tell the story  over and over again  to anyone that will listen  to make himself look better,  I guess,  that he had something over me.  It's just not true.  I was assistant promotion director.  Woo-hoo, I know.  Woo-hoo.  I had to deliver  the fucking pizzas  for the midday guy.  That was my original job  to office parks  all over Rochester.  Sound familiar?  Yeah.  Type of stuff you were doing?  Well, we got a guy.  Scorch?  And then the midday guy  who never made it  out of Rochester.  Just cut him off.  We don't care what he says.  Never made it out  of Rochester himself 
[01:35:00]  would just, like,  look down at me  and tell me not to be  late and stuff  and make sure  the pizza doesn't slide  in the box  and all that shit.  So, Sam,  what kind of stuff  are you doing?  Yeah, but he's...  I'm asking you.  Interning.  I love that.  He starts talking.  And who gives a shit?  Hope he didn't miss a beat.  Yeah.  Well, I do some of that.  And then the guy was...  Well, we'll get to you  because now, you know,  it's bringing back  bad memories.  That's exactly what 
[01:35:30]  Hope should have done.  I would come in  as the eager guy  new to the radio business  and the midday guy  would be like,  all right, look,  today it's three pizzas,  pepperoni,  hot peppers,  and sausage.  Don't be late  like you were last week.  Here's the directions.  If you have any problems,  tough shit.  A gopher.  Dude, he had something  over me  and he knew it  and he would just play me  and just like,  you are such a dick.  Yeah.  That's Norton Norton?  No, it's another guy. 
[01:36:00]  He's miserable,  so we'll let him slide today.  But he never made it  out of Rochester.  Another one market sensation.  But he would just beat me up  and, you know,  I was making no money.  I was happy to be there.  And he just treated me  like shit.  The fact is,  I worked with Brother Weez.  Brother Weez took me  under his wing  and made me feel  like an equal  even though I wasn't.  I knew I wasn't equal.  He would give me my time  and I knew what I had  to say back then  was just awful.  You think it was awful?  Yeah, but he never  called me out on it.  He would just kind of like,  you know,  be cool about it and stuff. 
[01:36:30]  And, you know,  I learned a lot from the guy.  Does Brother Weez have audio  of young Opie?  And they have to say  everything, right?  Oh, I got air checks  going all the way back  to my college days.  I'll bring him in.  I have no problem  bringing that stuff in.  But supposedly  there's Spuds Buckley  audio out there, I guess.  There's a guarantee  somebody has it.  Somebody was recording  a song or something  and left it going  and then we're going  to go to Spuds  and you went,  hibernating.  So do we have to play 
[01:37:00]  another song from this?  You don't have to.  And what awful stuff  do you have to do in Syracuse?  I didn't mean to interrupt  you there, Sam.  No, Scorch actually did.  How many years  did you actually work up  for, would you say?  I did a couple of years  in Rochester.  I did like three years  in Buffalo.  Upstate New York is awful, dude.  It's just absolutely awful.  So, all right.  Do we have to play  another track, Sam?  No, not at all.  You're running the show  right now.  Is it worth it?  I don't know.  Sam?  The only thing that's worth 
[01:37:30]  is the 50 cent song on there.  Called In Da Sack?  Yeah.  All right.  Let's hear a little death.  Ho, ho, ho.  Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.  Ho, Santa.  It's your birthday.  Merry Christmas.  It's your birthday.  Fun or eggnog.  It's your birthday.  We're going to death that hard  because it's your birthday.  Got a lot of presents in the sack.  Toys gave you jack  for the kids to the back.  I'm the man with the gift.  Don't save the tax. 
[01:38:00]  Just leave milk and cookies  and I'll be back.  Hi, kids.  Come on up.  Sit in my lap  and I'll tell you a tale.  A Christmas rap.  My name is Chris Kramer.  I deliver the toys for me.  You know what bothers me?  Is, first of all,  this is so bad.  I want to bite you  for bringing this in.  Is that Sam rides  around Rochester  and Syracuse, wherever.  Jimmy is so angry.  I love it.  And he laughs  at that fucking rap. 
[01:38:30]  Yeah.  You laugh at that.  You chuckle.  I don't laugh at it.  I don't think it's funny.  I brought it in  because I said,  this is the type of thing  that's going on  on Top 40 radio.  It's terrible.  Maybe they'll squeeze it in somewhere.  Then you guys start  talking about deaf comedians.  When did you start at BAB?  Me?  Yeah.  I don't know.  91, I think.  91?  About?  Because that's kind of  where you started  getting into your own,  really.  Yeah.  No, I got into my own  in Buffalo.  Before that?  Really?  Yeah, because the program director  wasn't going to keep tabs on me 
[01:39:00]  because he wanted to sleep  and I did overnights.  Oh, there you go.  Gives you a chance.  I got to get a little crazy  but I had to air check  my own show  so we could go over  in the office.  So I would air check  like basic breaks  like, you know,  here's Metallica.  And then give him those.  On 103.3 The Fox.  Yeah, just smooth radio shit  and all the other dumb  crazy stuff I was attempting  and trying out.  Keep off tape.  Yeah, I would have  the cassette player  just on pause mode.  Good idea. 
[01:39:30]  Very wise.  So it did start back then.  What?  Yeah, here, here.  Why don't you give Sam  back his deaf CD?  What I want to know  is would this guy be able  do you think this guy  would come on the phone?  If you really wanted him to.  Oh, he's deaf Jeff  but he spells it with G-E-O.  Yeah, G-E-O-F-F.  I don't know, it should be  I'd love to get this guy  on the phone here.  No, he wouldn't.  I would love to talk  to deaf Jeff.  No, this segment  stinks enough.  I want to talk  to deaf Jeff.  You know how we were  talking about like  how this show 
[01:40:00]  is a soap opera  and we got all  these story threads?  This is one that's  going to end right now.  Is this not  what?  Is this highlighted  or scribbled out?  It was highlighted  but photocopy.  Jesus Christ.  It's like  it's scribbled out  and I'm like  it's the funniest  part of the story.  Why would you  hold on  here Sam  but it was highlighted  there goes the CD.  I just wanted to put that  where you wouldn't lose it.  And Sam's just going to  continue standing there  awkwardly. 
[01:40:30]  Who scribbled this out?  I want them fired.  No, they were  highlighting it.  Oh.  They highlighted it  and then photocopied it.  All right, here's  the original ant.  Yeah, there we go.  Makes it much easier.  We got the bio on  what's her name again?  Kathy Buckley.  Can we get a  Kathy Buckley CD  or some audio  of Kathy Buckley?  Please, I need audio  of Kathy Buckley.  She's billed as  America's first  hearing impaired  comedian  because it's not  a comedian  when it's a girl, Opie.  It's a comedian.  It's a comedian.  Comedienne. 
[01:41:00]  Kathy Buckley  is also a  four-time  American Comedy Award  nominee.  Didn't win, huh?  Best stand-up  female comedian.  In June of 98,  her highly acclaimed  autobiographical  hit theater play  Don't Buck With Me.  Get it?  It's Don't Fuck With Me.  But since she's deaf,  you can't think  of the M-word right  since you go,  Don't Buck With Me.  Too bad her name isn't  And it's a play  on her last name.  That's really cute.  It should be Kathy.  Nice.  Kathy Bunt  would be a great 
[01:41:30]  name for her.  I'm a deaf Bunt.  A one-woman show  and tale  enjoyed a three-month  return  Los Angeles engagement  Three months, huh?  What a run.  At the prestigious  Tiffany Theater.  Don't Buck With Me  first opened  No, Anthony,  you didn't say it right.  Don't Buck With Me.  No, there's an  exclamation point.  Don't Buck With Me!  You know, I cannot use  an exclamation point  anymore without 
[01:42:00]  thinking that.  Don't Buck With Me!  Sometimes I want to be  excited about what I'm  typing.  Yeah, my exclamation  points have been  drastically reduced.  They should be.  Since you've been  doing that bit.  They should almost be  like down to a minimum.  Like if you say  something like,  Eric, if you ever  hand me something  that is as scratchy  as the other one,  I'll smack you  in the face!  Yeah.  Success, however,  in the theater  and other mediums  was far from mine  the first time  Kathy stood in  the world of comedy  on its ear. 
[01:42:30]  Get it?  That's fucking awful!  Isn't that horrible?  On a dare from a friend,  she entered a comedy  contest called  Stand Up Comic  Take a Stand  in 98.  She was nervous,  not because it was  her first time  performing on a comedy  on a stage,  or even the fact  that she couldn't  hear the audience  respond except by  vibrations from  the stage floor.  What made her nervous  was discovering  that she was competing  against comedians  who had been  in the business  for years.  Oh no.  Hey look,  Voss has been  in the business  for years, okay?  But Kathy forged ahead. 
[01:43:00]  I owe Kathy money  for a miracle ear.  I'm dodging her.  I'm dodging her.  She won fourth place  there.  Jesus.  And then played  at Caroline's,  Catch a Rising Star,  the improv.  Please get to the  fucking humor  in this story.  I mean,  when you got gold,  why are you reading  boring shit?  Because you can't  go right to the gold.  You got gold.  All right.  People are turning  off their radios.  No, they're not. 
[01:43:30]  They're going to miss  the best part of a bio.  No, there's a part here  that is highlighted.  You have to have  a dynamic.  This is the boring  part of her life  and career.  And she did poorly  in school.  Who cares?  There's a funny line  before you get to that.  Great.  The ten people  that have nothing  better to do  than hang out  through this shit  are still listening.  Everyone else  has had fucking  big tracks.  How about this?  Her poor performance  in second grade  landed her in a school  for retarded  and physically impaired  children.  Now, that's funny.  It took school  administrative psychologists 
[01:44:00]  and audiologists  nearly a year  to discover  it was just  a hearing loss  and not a lack  of mental acuity  that was impeding  her speech  and language development.  Today, Kathy shakes  her head  as she quips  to amazed audiences  and they call me slow.  And the reason  she shakes her head  is because it always  feels like she has  water in the ear.  She's always jumping  on her left foot  her left heel  trying to shake it out.  All right.  Now you want the funny?  Yeah.  She's deaf.  No, fuck it. 
[01:44:30]  Let's just move on  to something else.  Please read this.  During her late teens  Kathy's life  was interrupted.  Hold on.  Hold on.  All right.  I know at times  this is overplayed  but hold on.  All right.  Can you back up  a little bit?  I think we're all ready.  All right.  I'll back up  like the jeep did.  Okay.  Like a rock  she laid there 
[01:45:00]  like a rock.  Now she's already deaf.  During her late teens  Kathy's life  was interrupted  when she was run over  by a jeep  while sunbathing  on the beach.  Oh, is that horrible. 
[01:45:30]  How fucking much damage  could it do?  It's just going to  mush it out  into the sand.  That's a jeep.  They're light.  Well, apparently  as a result  she experienced  intermittent  paralysis  in the legs.  Her recovery  from being run over  by a jeep  took almost  five years.  Thank God though  she recovered  from the jeep.  Then just six years later  she was diagnosed 
[01:46:00]  with cervical cancer.  This woman's got  stand-up comedian  written all over her.  That's horrific.  That's horrific.  Oh, that is...  Now, I don't understand  that they make fun of  here's the thing.  They do the little  ear thing before.  She turned the comedy world  on its ear  because she's deaf.  Why don't they do it  a little bit later?  She then came back  to the scene  and turned the stand-up world  on its cervix.  Undaunted. 
[01:46:30]  She's turned roadblocks  into springboards.  That's nice.  Springboards?  Yeah.  She's turned  roadblocks  into speed bumps.  Oh, damn it.  I swear to you  beat me by half a second.  Fuck, I hate you.  You're just too  fucking quick.  There was a roadblock  on that beach.  Oh, Jimmy,  you have no idea.  Using her personal experience  as a launching pad 
[01:47:00]  for humor  and education of others.  And she's been doing  comedy ever since.  My God,  she's been on everything  in 1990.  I don't see one  year 2000 thing  in this.  Everything kind of ended  in 98.  The problem is  we have a fine comedy channel  here on XM.  150.  And what's the other one?  What's the old school one?  Laugh USA was clean.  Yeah, what numbers?  It doesn't matter.  I listen to 150  mostly anyway.  And we can't find  any of her stuff 
[01:47:30]  in the master computer.  Really?  Check Laugh USA.  Maybe the same thing.  No, yeah,  they just don't have  anything in the  master computer on her.  Nothing like that?  I would love to hear  some of her comedy now.  Maybe they're interested  in other places  like the NASCAR channel  or Traffic.  or Deep Tracks.  Deep Tracks.  I like that.  What was left  in the sand?  Deep Tracks.  At that Jeep hitter, 
[01:48:00]  she was almost  on the boneyard.  Yeah,  try the boneyard.  Is there a squiz joke  in there?  I don't know.  You'd have to go  a long way  with that one,  I guess.  Yeah,  there's something  in there  with the fucking  thing crushing  her innards.  All right,  let's say how  to Pete in Pennsylvania.  Pete,  what's up?  Okay,  maybe.  Yo,  I know there is.  Hold on,  sir.  That Jeep ran over  her bowels  were Lucy.  Oh, my God.  God damn it.  All right, 
[01:48:30]  what channel's  open road?  Let's get a channel  guy,  huh?  Immediately.  I got  cervical cancer.  They're going to  have to zap me  with some high  voltage.  Hey,  that's good news.  They're getting  some of her audio.  Yeah?  Find some?  Theo?  Few minutes.  Oh,  few minutes,  that says?  Theo minute. 
[01:49:00]  It looks like  Theo Ninuteo.  I got to hear  some of her.  I swear to God.  Good penmanship.  Oh,  we lost the caller.  My old pal,  Bearman,  that's doing  mornings in Allentown,  supposedly has the  audio of Spence Buckley  as well.  Spence Buckley audio?  Who'd you have?  Fucking Bearman?  Look,  this is the deal.  I'm going to be honest.  I'm going to tear down  the 18th wall today.  If the audio...  18th wall?  How many guns is this?  If the audio makes it  to the XM facility 
[01:49:30]  here in New York City  and I don't see it,  it's safe to be played  on the old show.  Yeah.  But it's such an embarrassment  to me.  If I do see it myself,  I will not be able  to help myself  and I will take the package  and I will bring it home  with me  and I will destroy  another copy.  Wow.  Another.  I would like to sound  like a tough guy today  but it is that embarrassing.  Yeah.  But if they could get  the audio to you guys  without me knowing it,  I promise you 
[01:50:00]  we'll play it on the air.  Okay.  So like a little game.  It's going to be  a little game.  That's what we do,  okay?  That's what we do now.  That's what we do.  All right.  Why don't we,  we're going to get  some of her stuff.  Got to hear it.  In the meantime,  we can play our deaf song,  The Greatest.  It's not deaf though,  it's retards.  Yeah,  this is a couple  of retards singing.  It's one of those  make your own record places.  You've seen them  at Great Adventure  or other little amusement parks,  you go in  and make your own record  and there was a field trip  with a bunch of 
[01:50:30]  retarded teens  and they went in  and recorded a song  and whoever the counselor was  or whoever was bringing them  on this trip  thought it was very hysterical  and decided to put it  on the internet.  Yes.  Instead of just looking  and going,  this is a great moment  for these two,  he saw the humor in it  and put it out  and it's great.  We love playing this thing  and hopefully  after we play this  we'll have some  Kathy Buckley  standing up.  Okay?  Two retards singing  I Had the Time of My Life. 
[01:51:00]  Derek.  I had the time of my life  Now I never felt this way before  Yes, I swear  It's the truth  And I owe it all to you  Cause I've had the time of my life  Now I've always felt this way for you 
[01:51:30]  I've been waiting for so long  Now I finally found this fun  to stay by me  Yeah, we're riding on the wall  And you felt the magic called fantasy  Now we touch it in our eyes  It's the way we turn the sides  secretly 
[01:52:00]  Now we take each other's hand  Talk to each other's hand  Talk to each other's hand  Talk to each other's hand  Talk to each other's hand  Just remember us  You're the one  The one  Can't get our love  So I tell you something  This could be fun  Stay in one 
[01:52:30]  Oh, I've had the time of my life  And I never felt this way before  Yes, I swear  It's the truth  That I don't want  To do  To do this  And my body and soul  God, you know  That you never know 
[01:53:00]  So don't just let it go  Be afraid  To lose control  No  Girl, I know you saw your mind  You stay  Stay with me tonight  Me  Stay with me  Oh, I won't want me  I can't get enough of  So I'll tell you something 
[01:53:30]  That you can't get enough  Because  I've had the time of my life  No, I never felt this way before  I swear  It's the truth  Oh, I won't want you  I won't want you  All I've had the time of my life  That you can't get enough 
[01:54:00]  And I just see that I'm gone  That I've found  No, I'll tell you  That you can't get enough  Oh, yeah. 
[01:54:30]  Oh, I had the time of my life, and I never felt this way before.  Without this way.  This is the truth, and I owe it all to you. 
[01:55:00]  Oh, I had the time of my life, and I never felt this way before.  Without this way.  This is the truth, and I owe it all to you.  Oh, I had the time of my life, and I never felt this way before.  Oh, I had the time of my life, and I never felt this way before. 
[01:55:30]  Without this way, it's the truth, and I know it all to you.  Oh, I had the time of my life, and I never felt this way before. 
[01:56:00]  I'm coming down to the ATL.  That's right, Hotlanta.  Jim Norton heading down to the Punchline Comedy Club.  March 16-18.  That's this Thursday, Friday, Saturday.  Box office number is 404-252-LAFF.  That's 404-252-LAFF.  March 16-18.  Thanks, Steve. 
[01:56:30]  What's this note say?  Atlanta has n-  Yes, it does, and I'd appreciate it if none of them came to my show.  We work with a bunch of lunatics, I got to tell you.  Out of their minds.  Jim Norton has pretty much given up on today's show.  He's in the office.  He's got Francine on his lap.  Everybody's been watching on the O-Fans One camera, is our office camp, just watching 
[01:57:00]  Jimmy sitting in his chair with Francine on Jimmy's lap, and Jimmy was just molesting  her the whole time.  Dude, you were molesting.  Lift up your shirt.  No, Ron.  I got like that.  No, you got a little action there.  I'm not sure you would look.  No, I don't.  Oh, God.  Get that fucking thing away.  Oh, God.  Damn it.  Fucking.  All right, I'll tell you.  I'm filing sexual harassment charges against you. 
[01:57:30]  What's that, Steve?  It's the good time.  Oh.  For the good of the show.  Steve has brought in Kathy Buckley audio.  Steve?  Thank God.  Yeah, this is good.  This gets better and better, because this isn't her stand-up, or it's part stand-up.  It's, what is this?  I guess this is what Kathy Buckley does now.  Some stand-ups go with the whole-  That's what she does now.  The whole motivational speaker thing.  Some stand-ups, they'll go from-  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  They'll start off with stand-up, then they'll go and tell personal stories and work it into  how-  She wasn't being booked anymore, was she?  Personal stories of courage as a motivational speaker is what she does now. 
[01:58:00]  But, since she has a background in comedy, Opie, it's not just motivational speaking.  There's a touch of humor to it.  Exactly, like she'll tell a traumatic story from her own life, like how she lost her hearing,  and then she'll follow it up with a joke and make everybody feel better.  And that inspires-  Can we play a simple game here on the program today?  Uh-huh.  We'll play the Kathy Buckley audio, and we'll try to figure out what part of this is serious  and what is the joke.  All right.  This could be very difficult. 
[01:58:30]  All right.  Okay.  How are we going to decipher the two here?  Well, let's play it and see how it plays out.  I guess when you want to guess, we'll raise our hands and we'll stop the audio.  Yeah.  All right.  Here we go.  Kathy Buckley.  It's motivational speak, speech, motivational speak-ing.  Motivational speaking.  Speaking and a little bit of comedy.  That's just true.  I am hearing the head.  No, I am not deaf.  I just don't listen. 
[01:59:00]  Now, lip reading is my main source of communication, and I do have to go up to people sometimes and  say, excuse me, but I do lip reading, and I usually get the, ooh, ooh, sorry.  Serious?  I've not had a date in three and a half years.  Now, I don't know if it's because I haven't heard the phone ring or what.  Not bad.  Maybe it's the tire tracks over your thighs.  My favorite thing that I love is when a man kisses me on the neck.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:59:30]  He walks his way up to my ear, sticks his tongue in my ear, and gets electrocuted.  It's deaf chick humor.  Yeah, but she's good, though.  She doesn't suck.  I mean, it's not bad jokes.  I mean, they're not as awful as I thought they'd be.  They're not bad.  Yeah, I know.  I didn't hear the phone rings.  You know what, though?  Which means this segment sucks.  We were really hoping that it would be hacky stuff.  You know what, though?  I can't take the crippled comic thing.  Sorry.  I don't mind that the material's good and backs it up. 
[02:00:00]  Like, you gotta go with what's yours, like, which I, you have to.  And, um, if it's good material, I don't mind it.  Yeah, but it's too, it's like the whole joke.  You sit there.  She's deaf.  All right.  I'm gonna sit now through a half hour, 40 minutes of deaf jokes.  Ah, no.  See, those were, those were, uh, okay, like, lines for a deaf comic, I guess, but that's  all you're gonna get.  Well, the next track is, uh, she talks about accident that messed up hearing, among other 
[02:00:30]  things, right?  I was 20 years old.  I was laying on a beach sunbathing.  Life car jeep ran me over.  Talk about not knowing what your job description is.  The jeep ran over my face, stomach sucked, tied in back.  I was laying.  That was the joke.  Somebody actually laughed when she said I was run over by a jeep.  You heard, ah, ha, ha, ha.  Because you think you're seeing stand-up.  I know.  You don't know.  And then you're like, oh, wait, she's being serious now?  Is that what caused her hearing?  Yeah, did that cause her to lose her hearing? 
[02:01:00]  No, no, no, it did not.  No, but she said when she was in school.  And the kid, they thought she was retiring when she was two.  They realized that she was, uh, fucked up, yeah.  I guess at this point, we gotta introduce Club Soda Kenny.  Because he really enjoyed that joke.  Hi.  Hello, peoples.  Are you on the talk?  Yes.  Thank you, everybody, for everything.  That's all I'm gonna say at the moment.  Yeah, well, I just wanna say a lot of people supported Kenny.  Yeah, they did.  On various message boards and stuff, you saw little, uh, things that people attached to  their, uh, signature pics of Kenny. 
[02:01:30]  Yes.  And I wanna thank everybody.  Everybody's support was overwhelming.  And Club Soda Kenny is alive and well.  Bravo.  And he looks very happy.  Yeah.  Yes.  He's not allowed to talk, but he looks very happy.  Yes.  Thank you.  And I'm gonna do this today.  I'm gonna give him a thumbs up.  Oh.  Well, thank you.  I'm gonna bow to you.  Jimmy.  Thank you.  I'm gonna give you some, a little conditioner, cause your hair is very dry.  Thank you.  And my reply to that is, O and A, all the way, that's what I say. 
[02:02:00]  Oh my God.  I want that in my machine.  That's wonderful.  Can we do that, E-Rock?  Of course.  That's a perfect, can you do it again?  O and A, all the way, that's what I say.  All right, I need that.  All right.  Of course.  So, uh, here's, uh, Kathy Buckley.  She, I backed it up because one dope in the audience or a couple people are like laughing 
[02:02:30]  when she's just going to run over.  I like when she describes what the Jeep hit.  She has to name every organ.  It was my head, chest, and neck area.  I was very injured.  Very injured.  And my shoes came off.  How did you get off?  I fell down the stairs and my uterus fell out.  I'm barren.  I can't have children now.  God damn it.  I was 20 years old. 
[02:03:00]  I was laying on a beach sunbathing.  Light car Jeep ran me over.  Talk about not knowing what your job description is.  The Jeep ran over my face, stomach stretch, side and back.  I was laid up for five years.  I died at the scene of the accident.  Sorry.  At least I believe I did.  It was like something told me it was going to happen before it actually happened. 
[02:03:30]  I was laying on the beach sunbathing.  Beep, beep.  I was laying there and the shadow came over me really quick.  And people were pointing at me and going, move.  Beep, beep is going to make me laugh all day.  They told me.  Yeah.  Actually happened.  I was laying on the beach sunbathing. 
[02:04:00]  And I just felt this feeling that I was supposed to go.  That I'm watching the Jeep.  And I'm thinking to myself, my God, the way that Jeep is running around, someone's liable to get run over.  I never thought it was going to be me.  Run over my face, stomach stretch, side and back.  When it happened to me, when the Jeep ran over my face.  I opened my eyes and I saw the bottom of the Jeep. 
[02:04:30]  And I could see the two rear reels coming at me.  And all I could think about is I needed to protect my head.  So I went to put my arm up above my head.  And unfortunately when I did that, the rear reels took my elbows and took me and turned me.  What?  I was laid up for five years.  In and out of a wheelchair for two and a half years.  They said I'd never walk again.  I figured I didn't hear them.  I got up and I left.  Oh, you go girl.  That's right.  That's right. 
[02:05:00]  You should have got up and sunbathed on the deck, old clumsy.  That's what you get.  There you go.  Jeep ain't going to hit you on your own deck.  Good point and good point.  She saw it zipping around an hour ago and she still laid there in the pan.  At the last time I have a sunbathe on the Garden State Parkway.  I thought they would slow down, but I was laying in the easy path lane.  That deep could hit somebody.  Yeah. 
[02:05:30]  Get up.  Fuck it.  She's describing looking under the thing and he needed an oil change.  You're deaf, not blind.  She certainly has a cute vision.  I guess she tried to put her arms up over her head and her elbows.  What?  I don't know.  I couldn't hear her.  I don't know.  She said something.  She was mumbling too much.  I don't know.  I'm thinking like it grabbed her and dragged her or something.  Yeah, it probably did.  It just hit her elbows.  Cracked her elbows.  That's wonderful.  Society put labels on me.  You're too tall.  You're too flat.  You're retarded. 
[02:06:00]  You're dumb.  You can't.  You won't.  You're unlovable.  Just loaded with labels all over me.  Passing judgment on me.  And I bought it.  I believe this is who I am.  Society created me to believe that I'm retarded.  That I'm stupid.  That I can't and I won't.  I'll tell you something.  I don't look very good in labels.  You don't look very good on the beach either.  Nice tattoo. 
[02:06:30]  Did that say you're good?  Long story.  I don't like labels.  Funny you don't mind being the deaf comic.  Yeah.  That's a label you don't mind.  That is a big label.  That's the top label, right?  We need to learn to communicate with our kids.  We need to learn to listen to them.  It's not always you do this, you do this, you do that.  It's like choices.  I do it with my godchild. 
[02:07:00]  Julia, honey, you want orange juice or apple juice?  She can't have it.  She says apple juice.  Well, we don't have any.  Have the orange juice.  But she's still got to make a choice.  Just because you choose to have something doesn't mean you're always going to have it.  Because you know for a fact that what you want and what you need are two different things.  And the problem with that is that every time we go for what we need...  She raises a good point because some days you want a suntan and you need an ambulance. 
[02:07:30]  This is depressing.  Isn't it just who's sitting in that audience?  Who is sitting there?  Who wouldn't be?  I'd be fucking howling through this.  Life is tough enough.  Why?  Why?  I'd rather hear his act.  Exactly.  And the problem with that is that every time we go for what we want, we miss the opportunity of what we need.  God will always put in your path what you need. 
[02:08:00]  It's you.  You're always going to walk.  What was it about a jeep driver?  A deaf girl?  I need a deaf girl.  The jeep's brakes weren't any good.  I need something to slow me down.  And God put her there.  I need a useless human in front of me so I don't hit those worthwhile ones.  Expendable.  Right.  And I looked at it.  It was the lifeguard who did it.  He's fucking riding with that white thing on his nose, all tan and attractive. 
[02:08:30]  She was probably looking at him before.  He's cute.  You know what happened?  He was too busy looking at the hot things.  It was right.  And you know what?  He saw her and just didn't feel like stopping.  If she looked like a hot piece of ass, he would have stopped.  I bet he would have.  He wasn't looking her way.  I wouldn't mind rolling around in the sand with him.  Life's a drag.  Elbows are caught under a catalytic converter.  And she has a mullet, too. 
[02:09:00]  It really bugs me.  It's stupid.  Hey, Joyce DeWitt.  Look, man.  If you're going to do this crap, you've got to expect to be goofed on.  Jesus Christ.  I mean, this is just too good.  She doesn't like Joyce DeWitt.  And apparently, two's company when it comes to ovaries.  What the hell is wrong with you?  What the hell?  Oh, my God. 
[02:09:30]  What a bunch of tragedy laid into...  Oh, it's fucking awful.  Would you guys like to hear one more track?  Yeah, let's hear it.  Can you break it down into two?  Please.  Just so I can say we have two more to look forward to.  Right.  Or just play it twice.  Do you ever notice when you plan things, do you ever go, okay, now tomorrow I'm going  to do this and this and this and this and this.  You're one of those?  Yes.  You do that?  You plan all day long, right?  Well, tomorrow I'm going to do this.  What do you do the next day?  You plan for the following day, right?  You want to make God laugh? 
[02:10:00]  Tell him your plans.  Because you ever notice?  Half of your planning doesn't go through.  You miss an incredible opportunity right here and now.  It could be with your child, it could be with yourself, it could be with anything.  But you're missing right here if your mind is all the way over here.  If your mind is over here, your foot's over there.  Your elbows are up here and your ears are over there.  I get what she's saying.  Yeah.  Live for the moment.  That's it. 
[02:10:30]  Let's spend all your time planning.  Just live.  Do.  Don't plan.  Speaking of the moment, somebody has to leave shortly.  Yeah.  One time already?  Right.  He's got a few minutes, can he?  Jimmy Norton's cutting class.  I have to go.  He's cutting class.  I took a 1230 flight.  Someone's asked to kick somewhere?  You got to hop on a plane?  I'll get me two days notice.  I was laying on the beach right over my face, stomach, asshole, and toes.  And right over my stapled stomach. 
[02:11:00]  Wow.  That is inspiring.  It's terrific.  Or something.  I mean, of course you feel bad.  How many minutes you got?  Because we got the new Adventures of Old Christine.  Who's that?  It's the Julia Louis-Dreyfus show.  Julia Louis-Dreyfus.  Let's go right now.  I got to see this.  You got a few minutes?  Yeah, I just want to start it.  You want to start this, at least?  Linda Stassi gave her three stars.  Well, it's the new sitcom.  This is her third or fourth since Seinfeld. 
[02:11:30]  They talk about the Seinfeld curse, Opie.  The Seinfeld curse.  Right.  Everybody has tried, except for Jerry, to get a new series going.  And they have been horrid flops.  They normally are, though.  All of them.  Did anybody want to see Aftermash?  Did you want to see them?  No.  I'd still like to bang her.  Sure.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  All right.  I like her.  Oh, good.  Good for you.  Thank you.  But that really helped the conversation.  I know. 
[02:12:00]  No, it was actually really good.  We really liked it.  Thank you.  You're welcome.  You're welcome.  Wow.  Both sounds from that beach a few years ago.  Well, we love doing this because sitcoms just stink.  Yeah.  And then the good sitcoms go away, like Arrested Development.  You got things that people like.  I heard that was very funny.  I finally got the DVD for my brother.  Oh, my God.  I'm laughing my balls off.  I had no idea how great this show was.  David Cross was very funny. 
[02:12:30]  And is it back on?  Then they brought it back again, and then they canceled it again.  There's a rumor it's going to Showtime.  Apparently, it didn't do well with, like, viewers, but the critics loved it.  It was a very good show.  It was a funny show, man.  That and The Office, and you've got to curb your enthusiasm.  So you do have some of these sitcoms that are thinking out of the box.  We're talking about the sitcoms that we've seen done a million times on TV,  and they continue to throw these shows at us.  Well, Opie, before I go, I'd like to, after that depressing statement, 
[02:13:00]  I think it's safe to say we need a few laughs.  All right.  Well, the show is getting good reviews in general.  Okay.  And they're saying this is a winner for her.  Oh.  Can I make a comment?  Sure.  You know, this is going to be a surprise to little Jimmy.  I'm trying to pitch a sitcom for him about a hemophiliac teacher that goes back to his old neighborhood.  I call it Welcome Back Clotter.  Oh, my God. 
[02:13:30]  Wow.  Oh, my goodness.  I think that'll be good for Jim.  Looks like somebody settled happily.  Well, Ice Cube's going to be the new Welcome Back Clotter.  What?  He's going to be Mr. Clotter, yes.  Ew, is he really?  What?  Yes.  Wait, wait, what?  We didn't get to this yesterday.  Sweathog's rule.  Cube welcomes back Clotter.  Why can't we have white people play white parts?  Bring out the welcome wagon.  Ice Cube has signed on to play the title role in a film adaptation of the classic 1970s TV series Welcome Back Clotter. 
[02:14:00]  It was announced Tuesday.  Is a white guy playing Freddy Boom Boom Washington?  That would equal it out.  As part of his deal with Dimension Films, Cube will also co-produce the redo of the former ABC series that turned John Travolta into a household name.  There is no bigger fan of the original show than me.  And I'm very excited to be able to put a new twist on it, the barbershop star said in a statement.  It's going to be just as bad as the Honeymooners.  Let them do it.  Good.  Why?  I don't know.  I don't know. 
[02:14:30]  Hey, he's black.  We look forward to another.  I'm sure it'll be a hip-hop version of the song.  It'll be great.  We drove by.  We shot them.  We drove away.  I would like to see a movie version of that show if it was done right.  How could it be done right?  Wow.  Change the name of the thing. 
[02:15:00]  That's right.  What are they going to get?  Like an Urkel character to be like Horseshack?  Is that it?  I don't know.  Juan Epstein.  All right.  Jimmy's got to go.  Yeah.  Jimmy loves this bit.  Actually, this is a Jimmy Thann bit.  Thann creation, really.  I've got to give Thann credit for it.  It's a Thann creation, yes.  Thann-tastic Productions brings you.  Well, Thann definitely has some chops to himself there.  And you should just sit in for the rest of the show. 
[02:15:30]  Thanks.  I'll be right here.  All right.  Yeah.  Thann will help us out with the rest of the show when Jimmy leaves.  I say as a reward for his good service, we all hold Thann down and give his mouth  a fuck.  Who's first?  Well, don't everyone raise their hands at once.  All right.  So here's some examples of the comedy stylings of this fine sitcom.  Okay.  These are for school, lunch and two, snacks, one to eat, one to trade. 
[02:16:00]  Oh, and this is for dinner in case your dad makes that chicken thing with the cherries.  That's the very first joke coming out of it.  Right.  What's the premise here?  Well, that's the thing.  Is she a mom?  Yeah, but you don't know that.  I mean, you have to piece together.  You've got to kind of figure it out that she's a mom.  They're divorced.  Yes.  All right.  And how many kids?  Just the one, I believe.  Just one kid?  A girl or a boy?  It is a young man. 
[02:16:30]  A young man?  How old?  He's, you know, eight-ish.  Eight-ish?  And she's sending him off to school, I guess?  Yes.  And then, yeah.  Apparently, Dad can't cook!  Yeah, he makes that chicken with the cherry thing.  Thing, which is, no one likes it, but Dad keeps making it.  And who's the wacky character?  Uh, it might be her brother who I think lives with her.  Hmm.  All right.  Well, maybe, you know, I mean, who knows?  Yeah, let's give it, uh, at least a try here. 
[02:17:00]  I'm a wacky neighbor.  Here's some more audio from this fine sitcom.  So, do you like the zipper bags better than the pinchy kind?  We don't have to do the small talk.  Oh, thank you.  Okay.  Buddy, put your backpack on.  That's the new girlfriend.  Okay, have a good day at school.  I'll call you tonight to tell you that I love you and to say goodnight, okay?  Hey, Mom.  I love you.  Oh, and it's so sweet.  Reminds me of my mom.  Not that you're as old as my mom.  My mom is young.  She looks great.  You look great. 
[02:17:30]  We're going to go wait in the car.  Great, great, great.  Great.  Wow.  All right.  So, the kids going off to school.  How do they get away with this shit still?  Pretty good, though.  Linda Stassi liked it?  Horrid.  That, um...  There's a sex song.  Yes, Jeremy?  It was good.  Why are you singing it?  Oh, my God.  You just had sex. 
[02:18:00]  No, I didn't.  I was peeing.  I thought I made that clear.  No, no, no, no, no.  That's your sex song.  You always sing it after you...  perform your act.  That's how people talk.  No, I don't.  Yeah.  Yeah?  Who are you talking to, buddy?  I was there when we were married.  I heard it many, many times.  And then, not so much at the end.  And they, uh...  Because they weren't having sex anymore, I guess, right? 
[02:18:30]  And they get along still?  Of course they do.  There's no problems between them?  Of course, because all exes get along.  Yeah.  In the real world.  Yeah.  Reminds me of when me and Lily were sitting there and talking, and his wife wanted to  have sex and we're trying to convince him that she wants to have a kid.  And I go, do you think she just looked at your dirty, freckled cock and said, oh yeah,  I want that stuck in me.  Please tell me that's a real line from Lucky Louie.  It's a real line.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:19:00]  All right.  It's a real line.  Now that I'll watch.  That'll be on HBO in June, starring little Jimmy Norton.  Well, sorry.  Dirty, freckled.  Yeah, I actually improbbed that and I left it.  No, it's starring little Jimmy Norton.  That's right.  There's an apostrophe in there.  On the Opie and Anthony planet, it stars little Jimmy Norton.  Right.  Lucky Louie.  All right.  You want another example of this fine comic?  I do.  This is awful.  All right.  So I had sex.  Yep.  Christine and I have been dating for over three months.  You can't be surprised.  Oh, no, no, no, no.  I'm not surprised.  I mean, I've never really thought about it. 
[02:19:30]  But hey, if you want to jump into the sack with the first girl who comes along, be my guest.  Be.  My.  Gist.  Actually, she's not the first.  Right after you and I split up, I got one under my belt.  Under your belt?  What are you, a pirate?  Holy shit.  Stop.  Let me explain that joke, please.  Why are they?  Why are they?  Just explain where that might be funny. 
[02:20:00]  Um, because, oh, I know why.  She called him a pirate because he stuck it in her booty.  And it would hurt.  And he went, do you like that?  And she went, arr.  Arr.  Arr.  Why are, why is the audience laughing?  Well, it's a laugh track.  They don't laugh anymore.  I don't get it.  This is not fun.  Why don't they just, she should just have a character named Kramer and George and Jerry. 
[02:20:30]  And just do that.  Recast the whole thing.  And just do that.  And redo the old episodes.  You know, Chuck, uh, Chuck, Paul, how do you say his name from Fight Club?  Chuck Palahniuk.  Oh.  Has a very good observation in one of his fine books.  Yes.  He, uh, talks about the old sitcoms.  Mm-hmm.  Let's say the sitcoms from maybe the 60s.  Oh.  Early 70s, maybe.  And you hear those laugh tracks.  Yeah.  Do you realize that all those people that made those laugh tracks are now dead?  Are dead?  Like, you'll hear chuckling of the dead. 
[02:21:00]  Right.  The laugh of the dead.  Yeah.  You mean you watch, like, an episode of, uh, I don't know.  Just something old.  Flintstones.  Maybe go all the way back to Groucho Marx.  Wow.  That's going back a while ago.  Oh, oh, yeah.  Sometimes they show the audience.  And they were old then.  Like, they show people in their 80s.  Some old grandma is sitting there.  No, no, no.  She could have dropped dead, like, the next day.  The vitamins weren't as good back then.  Those people were only 40 years old.  Like, 40 and stuff like that.  Yeah.  They're just old.  Yeah.  Wearing suits and ties.  But it's a great observation by him.  He made a brilliant point, though, Groucho. 
[02:21:30]  He said that's what destroyed comedy.  Was the comedy writing was the laugh track.  Because you didn't have to be funny.  That's what he told me when, uh, when I was hanging out with him.  Hey, you guys want to hear another belt joke?  I want to hear one more.  I got to go soon.  But I want to hear one more because I think that this is a great bit.  Can you hear, could you hear two more before you leave?  You bet I could.  Give me a wink.  I'm sorry.  I shouldn't have brought it up.  Obviously, you haven't had any and you're a little.  Anyway, it's nothing to be ashamed of.  We've been divorced for two years, which means you haven't had sex in just over three years. 
[02:22:00]  Yikes.  For your information, Richard, I have had plenty of sex.  I don't tell you everything.  I've had it under my belt.  Over my belt.  Around my belt.  You know, I've pretty much worn out my belt.  Wow.  You and the guy from Suddenly Susan.  I got it.  Thank you.  Yeah, yeah.  That's very good.  That was clever, not funny. 
[02:22:30]  Yeah, it's clever.  That deserves like a kind of a car crash where everyone survives.  Yeah.  This is uncomfortable to listen to.  Well, you understand, because below the belt's an expression, and she's had it above the  belt, which meant he sat on her chest and jerked off in her face.  And then around her belt, which meant he put it in her shitter.  Up the ass.  She's worn out her belt, which means he likes to spank around the ass with her belt.  Nice.  All right.  Really?  So, plenty of sex?  Hey, when I gots to have it, I gots to have it. 
[02:23:00]  Look, it's not a competition.  You'll be ready when you're ready.  Oh, hey, I'm ready.  I'm ready right now.  Then I gots to go.  Because they're exes, I guess?  Yeah.  He was word playing, like, because she said when I gots to have it.  Yeah.  He was calling it back by saying, I gots to go.  Right.  Because he doesn't want to, you know, have her all sexed up.  This is the most unrealistic portrayal of a divorced couple. 
[02:23:30]  They're telling each other about their sex lives.  Being shy about it.  Oh, stop it.  I would be like, yeah, you know the colored girl?  Smell this.  And I'd pull my hog out.  Pin her down.  Give her the old Roman war helmet.  Nice.  Jimmy, you're getting very thin, by the way.  Oh, thank you, O.P.  Jimmy.  Jimmy.  I'm trying to.  What are you doing?  Oh, AIDS.  I want to become spelt.  You are very thin.  Wait, did you mention AIDS? 
[02:24:00]  You bet I did, G.H.  You're losing weight with AIDS.  I was overweight and embarrassed to go any place.  AIDS helped me get back into a size 12.  The AIDS diet plan helped me get back into a size 6.  AIDS helps control your appetite, so you lose weight.  Yet AIDS lets you taste, chew, and enjoy.  And the appetite suppressant in AIDS is not a stimulant.  AIDS helped me lose the weight.  It has nothing in it that could make me nervous.  Question, why take diet pills when you can enjoy AIDS? 
[02:24:30]  AIDS helps you lose weight safely and effectively.  Use only as directed.  Fucking, my stupid headphones are cutting out.  I love how he is so enthusiastic and happy about AIDS.  Lose weight with AIDS.  AIDS is wonderful.  I, um...  I have to get it going.  Where are you going, Jimmy?  To the ATL, baby.  Where?  Hotlanta.  Hotlanta, they call it.  He's flying to Hotlanta. 
[02:25:00]  He's doing a couple morning shows tomorrow.  Punchline tonight through Saturday.  And you're going to be on some morning shows tomorrow at remote locations?  Fucking live remotes.  Have fun.  They should be flying on commercial radio.  Please give us a full report what kind of remotes they are.  I bet you one's going to be at a car dealership.  No, they're both at Irish pubs for St. Patrick's Day.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, what am I thinking?  Of course, Friday.  That could work out well.  Well, listen to this.  I love you.  One of them wants you to do five minutes of stand-up.  Yeah, but as soon as I said that, this is how Pete told me. 
[02:25:30]  Say one of them wants you to do five minutes.  One of them wants you to do five minutes.  Absolutely not!  Is how that discussion went.  Yeah, because that never works.  No.  All right, one more clip.  She talks about being a slut.  Sex used to be my thing.  Cut.  Back senior year in high school, I was a little bit of a slut.  That's what I was known for.  I mean, that and my laugh.  You do have a nice laugh.  Oh, thanks. 
[02:26:00]  Too bad she wasn't known for her joke-writing ability.  Well, another great show.  When is that on?  You know when, where?  Time, channel, nothing.  No one gives a shit.  Who cares?  No one cares.  On channel shit at shit 30.  No, it's tomorrow at 11 o'clock at the Hard Rock.  Oh, tomorrow afternoon. 
[02:26:30]  Kenny, we're going to miss you.  I know.  I will make it up to you somehow, someway, someday.  Kenny, would it have been possible, let's say, you were there.  Yes, sir.  Would it be possible, under certain conditions, whatever happened, I'm not sure, whatever fallout  has happened, would it be possible, if you were there tomorrow, that you would have been  able to get up on stage and perform?  At the next live appearance, that will probably happen. 
[02:27:00]  Okay, but you wouldn't have been able to do it tomorrow.  Not until I sign my first pension check.  All right.  You want to make sure you get that under your belt, over your belt, around the belt.  I came up with that whole belt thing, but I'd use it.  Jeep ran me over my face, over my colon, over my tits, over my toes, over my knees,  over my ankles.  Squeezed their uterus out like space food.  But take a picture of Hulk Hogan for me.  I got two of my toothpicks. 
[02:27:30]  Oh, those lightberry gorgans just squeezed out of her asshole.  All right.  Jimmy's got to go.  Oh, he's got a flight to Atlantic.  Club started, Kenny.  It's great to see you happy again.  Thank you, everybody, for all your support.  It's been a very sad couple of months for Kenny, but...  Look, Mommy, a jellyfish.  No, let's walk away.  Have a great party tomorrow.  We will.  Thank you.  See you guys.  I'll see you guys on Monday.  All right.  Safe flight, Jimmy Norton.  And you have a great gig.  Break a leg, as they say. 
[02:28:00]  Without actually hurting yourself.  They just say that.  Bye, guys.  All right.  There goes Jimmy Norton.  Bye, Jimmy.  I'll see you next week.  Bye.  We're going to go to...  We're going to do something for the pal-talk people.  There's Jimmy's ass walking on the...  All right.  We get it, Jimmy.  Pull up your pants.  All right.  We're going to the bullpen.  We got Bob Kelly.  We're going to bring him out of the bullpen.  Bob Kelly's coming in.  He's going to do a reliever.  He's going to do an hour of radio for us.  And we also have Francine that will be stopping in.  Look at this.  Jimmy who is what I say. 
[02:28:30]  Jimmy who.  Our reliever comes in.  Our late reliever.  You want to do a little warm-up or you want to get right into the game?  What's up, guys?  No, let's just get right into this.  How are you doing?  You want to just throw a few pitches just to see how the arm is?  Yeah, let's go.  It's good, though, because we've been having a good show, so it's not like he comes in  with bases loaded or anything like that.  Let's relax.  Yeah, we get to relax a little bit.  Honestly, Jimmy threw too many pitches.  Yeah, that's all.  He threw too many pitches.  We want to rest him for the next game.  Rest him.  So we're going to get Bob.  We're going to relieve it.  No pressure. 
[02:29:00]  Allow him to throw some pitches today.  That's all.  What's up, boys?  How much, man?  We're going to take a break.  We just wanted you to settle in and get ready there, okay?  All right.  Fantastic.  All right.  Still want a long break?  Yeah, we'll go for a long break.  Break.  Nothing to do with Bob Kelly.  Let's take a 45-minute break.  Come on.  Hey, how you guys doing?  Welcome back.  We'll be back tomorrow.  Bob, you got anything to say?  Okay.  Da-da-da-bop-bop-bop-bop.  That's really funny.  Oh, gosh. 
[02:29:30]  Come on, man.  What the fuck is wrong with you?  What are your nose?  It's a breathe-right strip.  He wears them every day.  You're supposed to wear them to bed.  Does that upset your skin or anything?  Does it give you a rash or anything?  No.  I actually want to get the sinus surgery.  This just holds it open.  Yeah.  I can't understand why you're not getting dates walking around like that all day long.  See you guys.  All right, Jimmy.  Bye, buddy.  All right.  There it goes, Jimmy Norton.  He scared the shit out of you, didn't he?  Yeah, he scared the shit out of me, but that nose thing is weird, too.  Why are you supposed to wear those to bed? 
[02:30:00]  He wears them all the time now.  Do those things really work?  No.  You know how Jimmy is, though?  Jimmy's got an addictive personality.  He's got drugs and alcohol at one point in his life, and it's telephone rings.  Things like that.  I'm a professional.  You sit here, the first fucking minute you're here, and your old school telephone ring on  your cell phone.  And you know you're not the only one that decided that's a cool ring to have, right?  Look, it's retro, man.  I've heard three cell phones go off today. 
[02:30:30]  All three of them have that.  Yeah.  Fan?  I have that.  So there you go.  I want this one.  Number, please.  Number, please.  Oldie style operator.  What was the one where you crank the phone?  Was there a sound that happened when you used to have to crank the telephone?  That's the one I want.  Childhood memories?  Yeah.  I call them the good old days.  I want the Twitchell's ringtones.  No.  He was supposed to record those for me from my phone. 
[02:31:00]  I don't know if he's done that yet.  He's going to be at the Hard Rock tomorrow.  Oh, he annoys me with that.  I couldn't listen to that.  It's going to be one of the funniest things I've ever heard in my life.  It is funny.  It's hilarious hearing a dude at Tourette's on radio.  Are you going to the live broadcast tomorrow?  Yeah, I guess.  I don't know.  I didn't even know it was tomorrow.  Tomorrow's the St. Paddy's Day thing.  Yeah, Hard Rock Cafe, 11 a.m. to 2 p.m.  Yeah, yeah.  Drinking so we can all sleep in and everything.  I don't smoke.  Of course you don't.  I quit smoking five months.  Cigarettes.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  That's right.  You were smoking all the time. 
[02:31:30]  Smoking, quit smoking, quit drinking, quit drugs.  I don't have sex with hookers anymore.  No.  Actually, I swear to God, I went to a massage par the other night, and I didn't get a handjob.  It was a legit place.  A legit massage.  Legit massage.  So where are you?  But you know, the old instincts actually came into play because at the end when she was  doing my hamstring, I kept rising my ass up.  Come on, a little diddle.  I swear to God, I kept picking my ass up, and I was like, oh, this is not going to rub  my ass.  Why would you tempt yourself if you're trying to get rid of all that? 
[02:32:00]  Yeah, exactly.  That's kind of tempting.  Do you know how weird it is?  How sick women are?  How sick they are?  I was a legit place.  I had nothing to be worried about.  I got a thing, a text message, I know what you're doing, from my girlfriend.  Oh, shit.  Then, I got a mess.  She calls me up.  Right when I get out, she goes, where are you, sneaky?  And I was like, oh, my God.  I go, honey, I was just at a massage place.  It's an Asian place, but it's legit, it's open late, but she was like, I was talking 
[02:32:30]  about, I thought you were trying to stay out late to get me to pack for you.  Oh, no, you did the sitcom Spill the Beans when they weren't really asking.  Dude, I lost, and you know what?  All my player instincts that I used to have, if I just waited two more sentences, if I just  said what any other man would say, what are you talking about?  What are you talking about?  I would have been out of it, but Pussy Whip Bob, baby, right out, it came out.  I was at a massage place, it was Asian, but it's not, I mean, it's a legit one. 
[02:33:00]  I mean, she's like, what?  I swear to God, I heard what?  Wanted some help over here.  I heard her go, what are you talking about, faggot?  I thought about it.  That is really funny.  It was awful.  I was like, I just ratted myself out.  We'll settle in.  We've got to get a little food and do some things, and we'll continue with Bob Kelly, and  Francine is here.  She's trying to pitch a radio show that we could run on our channel.  Fantastic.  And can I read the tracks on this, or will that spoil the bit?  Does anyone know?  Danny cut it up. 
[02:33:30]  All right.  She's got two bits she's actually recorded for her radio show that she wants to have on  202.  Wow.  Okay.  Well, that sounds interesting, is it?  It sounds, supposedly, no, supposedly, Danny, can I name the tracks?  Yeah.  Well, let me just make sure.  Uh, yeah.  All right.  The Francine radio show, we've got two samples of what she wants to do on her show.  The first track is Francine gets knocked up.  Really?  And Francine has her first lesbo experience. 
[02:34:00]  All right.  Now, my interest has peaked a little bit.  And we're going to play these two tracks in just a bit, all right?  All right.  What?  Nice.  I've never had...  What's the name of the song again? 
[02:34:30]  Hold on.  Oh, thank you.  I had a brain fart.  The song remains the same.  The song remains the same.  Right, okay.  And a brain fart.  Until the vocal kicks in, I have no clue.  That's what was throwing me off.  I know.  We're back with the O.P. and Anthony program.  Bob Kelly's sitting in for Jim Norton, who's on his way to Atlanta. 
[02:35:00]  Hopefully, Jimmy will check in.  Well, it's going to be hard for him to check in tomorrow because we're doing the live broadcast.  Yeah, that's going to be one of those situations where it's going to be impossible to take phone calls or anything else.  Remember?  Remember last year when we said, oh, my God, we're never doing this again because it was just almost, almost impossible to do a show in that kind of situation? 
[02:35:30]  Well, I guess as a year goes by, we forget about the bad and go, hey, what a great idea.  Well, we do live and learn because last year we did the show really early and no one was allowed to drink, so they were just staring at us.  Yeah.  And we're like, if the bar was open, they would be just drinking their faces off and they could give a shit about what we're doing on that stage.  And they started drinking toward the end of our show.  And then when they were hammered, that's when we got some really good stuff.  Yeah.  Now they're going to be drunk at showtime.  We got a lot planned for tomorrow, including some karaoke that you'll enjoy. 
[02:36:00]  Oh, yeah.  Also Twitchels and Big A, everybody.  All the people that, well, over the past year have become celebrities in their own right on this program.  We'll be there because last year we were kind of new to the whole thing.  Right.  Didn't really have a lot of people.  No, because we had to get rid of all the old people.  Out.  And start anew.  What, were we going to bring Lady Di up?  Ugh.  The show is always, excuse me, always evolving.  Mm-hmm.  Finding new people, new bits.  There's a revolution going on here. 
[02:36:30]  We're not recording our old bits and making them cool for satellite radio.  We just do new bits.  Right.  And the show will end tomorrow like we did last year with everybody lining up and telling their favorite racist joke.  I can't believe you're actually suggesting this because last year it was so hard to sit there while just bad racist joke after bad racist joke came up.  And Bill Burr was there and was horrified. 
[02:37:00]  Mm-hmm.  I don't, and he was very new to the show at that point.  I don't think he really understood what was going on.  But he did come back, didn't he?  He did come back.  But I don't think he understood what was going on.  Like, all right, you know, these are jokes.  It's not a Nazi rally we're at.  Not yet, right?  What time is the Nazi rally?  But it really, like, struck him.  All we ask is that you spread the wealth.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[02:37:30]  For every ten black jokes, give us a Polish joke.  One Polish joke.  Please.  Because by the end, it was just all about black jokes.  They pretty much shut down the show.  Yeah.  No, seriously, if we're going to do this, you got to.  Get some variety, people, please.  We got to spread the wealth.  Could you fucking, like, get your repertoire a little, uh, build it up a little bit?  It started out all cute.  It was like, oh, an Irish joke.  Oh, that's funny.  It started off Irish jokes.  And then it took just one person to be brave enough to tell the first black joke. 
[02:38:00]  And then all of a sudden the line got much larger and longer.  Oh, that's safe?  All right, I'll go up there.  That's how it is everywhere.  On a train.  Oh, yeah.  On a plane.  Truckers do that, too.  I was in a car with a guy at a CB radio.  He goes, watch this.  It's all truckers.  And he goes, hey, anybody got any good end jokes out there?  And they just went nuts.  It's just like so.  What do you call a hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo for, like, 25 minutes?  What y'all calls a, uh, how do you babysit a nagger? 
[02:38:30]  Uh, how?  Well, you, you, you wet his lips and stick him to the wall.  Great, thank you.  How do you keeps the nagger from jumping on the bed?  Well, how?  You, you put Velcro on the ceiling.  Get it?  Because the hire is all kinky.  And you put the Velcro on it.  Yeah, we get it.  We get it.  And it just kept going and going.  We got to get the truckers now to do this.  Oh, no.  That sounds like something I got to listen into.  Oh, my God. 
[02:39:00]  We have to have the truckers call in there.  They're listening like crazy.  A black trucker actually chimed in and he goes, you know, man, where can a black man  get something to eat it?  They go, niggers don't eat.  They don't eat.  You know, how many niggers does it take to tar a roof?  Well, three if you slice them thin enough.  Jesus Christ.  Yeah, we heard them all.  There ain't one new one.  That's what I defy you to come up with is a brand spanking new one that I haven't heard 
[02:39:30]  8,000 times.  They're all the same.  Let's go to Rob in Tampa.  Rob.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  How you doing?  Hey, man.  Hey, Bob, you shithead.  I was seeing you, man, when you were down in Ybor, man.  Hey, what's up, bro?  I was the Marine sitting in the front row.  Hey, buddy.  Kind of gave myself out at the end and gave you a hug, you little pudgy shit.  Ooh.  Well, thank you, sir.  Sounds romantic.  Yeah, he is romantic.  And he's a dom, too.  That's the way I like him.  Call me pussy again.  Hey, man, I just want to tell you, man, you did an awesome job down here, dude. 
[02:40:00]  You said you killed him.  You can get back down here, man.  Thank you very much, buddy.  All right.  Nice.  Bob Kelly killing in Tampa.  And another one saying Bob Kelly can't spell.  T-bag.  T-bagger.  What's up, shit dick?  Hey, man.  Hey, yeah, Bob.  I saw you when you were in Tampa.  My brother and I were sitting in the front row there.  You kept calling them Sasquatch through the whole show.  I went to sushi with you, right?  Yeah, we had sushi afterwards with those two chicks.  Yeah, all right.  And your friend accidentally made out with me.  No, that was me. 
[02:40:30]  No, I'm not.  Oh, that was you?  You know, we were kidding around at the end.  There was a few chicks there.  Just kidding around.  Yeah, you can start this story off however you want.  If this guy accidentally makes out with you, I swear to God.  I don't care how it starts.  It wasn't me.  Chicks.  That's all I'm saying.  We're kidding around.  He's like a porn star or something.  He's got pictures of his mule on his phone.  Oh.  You know, so we had a few chicks.  We went upstairs.  Keep mentioning the chicks.  And then there was, you know, some more chicks showed up.  Yeah, lots of chicks.  And then it was unbelievable that, you know, because we had so many chicks and no more chicks 
[02:41:00]  to get in.  And then all of a sudden there was so many chicks, we had to suck each other's cock.  Right.  Because you're so worked up with all the chicks.  No, at the end, we're saying goodbye.  You know, when you, you know, you're like, come here, give me, you know, give me, I was  giving the girls a kiss, girl a kiss.  I go, no kiss for you.  He goes, give me a kiss.  And I went to just joke.  Now, hold on.  Just joke.  You can't, can I just say something?  No, I got to interrupt you.  How long have you known this guy at this point?  12 minutes. 
[02:41:30]  Really?  12.  12 minutes.  12, 12 and a half.  You might do that with a friend after a lot of drinks in a tree fort.  You don't know how long.  Are you kidding me?  So he goes, come here, come here.  Or you say, yeah, come here.  I don't know if you've seen this guy.  He's not like a, he's not like an average looking guy.  Oh, he's cute.  Yeah.  Is that what you're saying, Bob?  Why don't you hold your judgment until you take a look at him?  You know?  I mean, geez, I'm in Tampa. 
[02:42:00]  I'm a little lonely.  All right.  But, uh, so at the end, he went to give me a kiss, you know, like joking.  Hey, I give you a kiss.  And we kind of went, but he didn't stop.  Right.  We didn't, you know, I'm not blaming him, but I am blaming him.  It's supposed to do the thing like when the celebrity gets up and walks out of the talk  show, like, I'm not going to take this.  And he gets out of his seat and walks a few steps and then sits back down.  He's not really leaving.  Yeah.  On the host's cock.  So, but he's never sucking the host's cock. 
[02:42:30]  So, so he walks up and goes, you know, kiss.  And you're like, ah, you know, expecting it to stop somewhere.  He didn't stop.  I felt his little mushed up tongue.  Stop it.  Trying to push through your lips.  My tongue didn't come out.  And I mean, correct me if I'm wrong.  Gay boy.  But yeah, we actually wasn't gay that I stuck my tongue out.  It was gay that you stuck it in your mouth.  Well, actually, he's trying to push through your lips.  Oh, oh, hang on.  Oh, oh, oh, hang on. 
[02:43:00]  I just got to get my shit together here.  Too late.  I was almost like seeing Twado again.  Oh, I.  So, yeah, he did it.  But it was like, ah, shit.  We both knew we fucked up.  So he just walked away.  The girls were like, oh, we're all like, oh, my God.  And I was just like, dude.  Anthony, you know who I am.  Well, you see me on Pal Talk a few times.  Oh, he want to make out with him now, too?  Really?  I've seen him on Pal Talk?  Oh.  Yeah, yeah.  I always have my AI with me there.  I show you my AI.  I thought he was going to say.  Oh, my God.  Okay.  I thought he was going to say, I always have my cock out. 
[02:43:30]  This big guy?  This big guy?  Hey, he's a big guy.  And he's, don't forget, good looking.  He's a good looking guy.  Jesus Christ.  And he's a nice guy.  We had a good time.  I thought for our first date, we had a nice time.  The sushi was nice.  Thank you.  Yeah, that's why I wanted to make out with you.  And as big as I am, my brother makes me look like a little tiny fucking...  They hold guys like you down, Bob.  This is the funny part, though.  We're driving away, and I saw him walking to his car.  Yeah.  Like, you know that was in his head.  Like, ah, dude, that was a good night, a good show.  Hung out with Bob.  We all had a good time with the chicks.  And at the end, I fucked it up. 
[02:44:00]  I did that stupid thing.  I took it too far and shit.  No, I didn't fuck up.  I was jerking off.  Hang on.  Oh.  So then we drive by, and we go, faggot.  But he didn't know it was us.  And you see him like, ah, shit, everybody knows I'm a faggot now.  They saw me kiss Bob.  I was just kidding.  All right, T-Bagger.  Bye, buddy.  Later, man.  Yeah, there's videos of him.  Everyone's calling up with their black jokes.  Listen, we'll do the trucker thing where they do it on the CB, and you can hear other truckers  doing it through the CB.  Yeah, we got to do it through the CB.  That's the bid, and we'll do it next week. 
[02:44:30]  How's that?  Someone remind us to do that bid next week, please, because we have short-term memory problems.  A trucker that'll get the whole ball rolling by asking for him, and then he's got  to put his...  Just like what happened with Kelly.  Yeah, he's got to put his phone up to the CB so he can hear the trucker.  Yeah, I want to see how the whole thing would develop.  How it plays out, not just people with racing.  All right, we got to get to the Francine show.  The Francine show.  She wants to try to do a couple hours on this channel.  We're starting to do that, by the way.  Patrice is doing his relationship show again.  Big hit.  This weekend, Saturday night from 8 to 10 Eastern time.  Yeah.  And then I think we got some other things in the works, definitely. 
[02:45:00]  But here's Francine, the Francine show.  A couple examples.  Yeah.  The first one is Francine gets knocked up.  Now, what the hell could this be about, aside from her being pregnant?  Danny?  Exactly.  Oh, Jesus.  Our own Francine was knocked up?  Yeah.  Yeah, I was surprised that she was so open about this stuff.  She is black.  All right, here we go.  The Francine show.  And actually, Fan was in for this portion, so.  Oh, good. 
[02:45:30]  He's at it.  Fan sits in.  Yeah.  You had an abortion, Francine?  Well, guess what, fellas?  I almost had to have an abortion, but I.  Wait, wait, wait a second.  I almost had to.  Instead, you had a baby?  I was 17, and I had a boyfriend, and we were having sex without condoms.  Always smart.  Yeah, not the greatest idea.  That's the voice of reason.  He didn't have any money, and neither did I have to, like, buy any. 
[02:46:00]  So, we just did it without it.  So, I got pregnant.  Congratulations, everybody.  Thank you.  Thank you, guys.  And I was really scared, and I was like, I don't really know what to do, and this is terrible.  But, um.  There was a flight of stairs.  No, no, here's the other problem, right?  I didn't really know if he was the dad, because I had also had sex with, like, another guy that month, right?  Wow.  But I believe he was only because they told me it was about three months that I was pregnant when I went to the hospital. 
[02:46:30]  He was the last guy I had.  It was between two guys.  So, I figured out it was him.  Probably.  So.  You are the father.  So, he was definitely the one that did it, right?  Plus, the other guy was like, I'm, like, infertile.  What's that mean?  I think, like, e-ful something, where you can't have kids.  No, infertile.  Sterile.  Sterile.  So, he was, like.  E-fertile. 
[02:47:00]  E-fertile.  Fucking website.  So, um, I was at the dentist.  Do you think maybe, um, that guy might have just said he was sterile, so he would never have to deal with any responsibility with impregnating you?  Well, I don't think I would have had the baby in the first place.  Alright, I'm sorry I didn't mean to interrupt your story.  So, fellas, this is what happened.  Jesus.  I told my girlfriends.  I didn't tell my mom until, like, I think last year.  I was, like, chickies, listen to me.  Because I had three chickie friends. 
[02:47:30]  Chickies.  I was, like, I think I'm pregnant.  And the, like, chickies at the nursing place said I'm pregnant three months.  And I was, like, I really can't have a baby.  I don't have any money.  So, I figured they were, like, we're all going to, like, pool together and give me some abortion money, right?  Because I was, like, I had no money.  And I was working.  It's $240 down at the free clinic.  Fucking Damone gets him pregnant. 
[02:48:00]  Oh, shit.  That was a great impression, man.  Thank you.  One of my favorites.  It's one of his best.  I love Damone.  That was a fucking great impression.  I love Damone, man.  Give him a little more.  I don't think he's heard this.  I thought we'd come by and help with your math homework on such a hot day.  Isn't this great?  What is that accent?  What is that a mix of?  I don't know.  It's just kind of Damone. 
[02:48:30]  It's just fucking Damone.  That's fucking great, man.  Shit.  He let us down.  No matter where you are, make like, that's the place to be.  Isn't this great?  I can make you happy at anything.  Dude, we had him on the show.  He let us down.  Kiss me.  He wasn't the fun Damone.  You won't regret it.  He, why, didn't do any of it?  He wasn't fun.  You're the assistant to the assistant manager of the movie theater.  What is that?  Is that New York Jewish?  I don't know what it is, but it's great. 
[02:49:00]  I love Damone.  Because I was like, I had no money, and I was working at Burger King, and I was like,  I was like in 11th grade.  Let's all put some money together and make over your uterus.  I had to.  Get the scar tissue removed.  Yeah, and I had braces, so like, I was paying for my own braces at the time, so I was like,  I have to pay.  How fucking hot is this?  Because my teeth were atrocious, like I said before. 
[02:49:30]  They were really bad.  So you worked at Burger King to raise the money for the.  Yeah, actually I did.  No, I didn't raise the money.  I was already, I was paying off like a $3,000 braces bill.  Wow.  Right.  Plus, I had to have oral surgery to move some teeth that were already inside my mouth.  My mouth was fucked up.  The guy could have just grabbed the baby while he was in there.  No, I wish, I wish I could have done that, but I'm at the dentist's office, I'm doing  like a dental thingy, and I think it was a cleaning, not an orthopedic, what, because 
[02:50:00]  that's for your teeth.  Oh my God.  Poor orthopedic.  I like felt blood coming out, so I was like, I wonder what this is.  Holy shit.  So I called my girlfriend.  This story gets funnier and funnier, Francie.  And she was like, I was like, listen, I got blood coming out my vagina, and I'm pregnant,  so this shouldn't be my period.  So she was like, well, I don't know what to do.  So what I did was, I was like, well, maybe I'm having my period anyway.  So I jammed a tampon up my crotch.  Oh, that's good.  Stop a little junior.  I called another chick. 
[02:50:30]  Stopped up his brain.  And she was like, oh my God, are you crazy?  Take that tampon out of your crotch and just go to the bathroom.  So I went to the bathroom, took out the tampon, and voila, all this red shit came out.  It was the baby.  It came on its own.  Give her a show.  You were covering up so much pain with that.  Oh my God.  And the baby came out to the toilet. 
[02:51:00]  Giving out cigars that say it's a blob.  It was red shit.  It was nothing about big old pile of shit just came out.  And I was like, yay.  And the first thing she's done is she just goes, free abortion.  I was like, I don't need any money anymore.  This is great.  This is great.  Holy.  Oh my dear, sweet Jesus. 
[02:51:30]  Let me look at my calendar.  Holy shit.  Are you kidding me?  That's the best thing I've ever heard.  That is the happiest miscarriage story I've ever heard.  Are you kidding me?  She didn't get a free abortion.  She had a fucking miscarriage.  That is the most honest fucking thing I've ever heard in my life.  That is unbelievable.  Think of how loved that child would have been had it lived.  She's laughing about flushing.  Not even an ounce of sadness.  No.  That's like she just hit a $20 scratch ticket. 
[02:52:00]  Yeah.  Yay.  Look, I would love to go to the next segment, but I have to address a few things with Francine  on this first segment.  Yeah, let's get Francine in here.  On this first segment.  Francine, get in here because holy shit.  She might have just got herself a couple hours on the channel.  That is new and that is fantastic.  Hi, Francine.  How are you?  You're not pregnant, are you?  Not this month.  Yeah.  Take a seat because then you're closer to the mic. 
[02:52:30]  Oh, my God.  Get her on the pallet on camera.  Yeah, turn that around.  Get that off of Bob Kelly.  Get that off of Bob and turn the – you can just spin it.  Don't use the mechanical thing.  Yeah, here.  I'll do it.  Physically do it.  Yeah, physically turn it and get Francine on camera.  There she is.  You got it?  I don't know.  Yeah.  She's right there.  Good.  Francine, that is a very candid story.  Thank you.  No one knew that.  It's a true story.  I don't doubt it's true.  It had too much – I don't think you could have made that up. 
[02:53:00]  It was when you were 17.  Yeah.  You got pregnant.  Was it a white guy?  No.  Actually, back then I used to date black guys.  Black guys.  Yeah.  So, he did you and then got you pregnant.  How old was he?  I think he was about 17, too.  About 17.  Also, you find out you're pregnant because you skipped three periods.  Yep.  You said you were three months pregnant.  Yep.  So, you skipped three periods.  Three months along isn't like – usually abortion is like you missed your first period. 
[02:53:30]  Girl goes and checks if she's pregnant.  If she is, she gets an abortion.  It's really nothing there.  You procrastinator.  The cell is pretty much, you know –  It's a little dot.  Yeah.  Divided into a couple of pieces.  Not, you know, at three months, there's some arms and legs and shit going on.  You can't fit it into a Petri dish at three months.  It's small, but it's starting to form, you know what I mean?  Looks like a gummy bear.  Yeah, yeah, a little gummy bear.  So, what made you wait three months?  Well, I had no money. 
[02:54:00]  I really didn't.  Did you look into how much it was?  Yeah, one of my friends had an abortion at 15, and she told me it was about 250.  About 250.  Yeah, and she told me it was really painful, so I didn't want to go through all that pain  she was talking about.  Unlike childbirth, which is a joy.  Yeah.  Yeah, just let it ride.  What were you hoping for?  Oh, my God.  I got to play that part.  You know, what were you hoping would happen if you weren't going for the abortion because  you couldn't afford it? 
[02:54:30]  You were just going to have a kid?  Nah, I couldn't have one.  So, what were you doing?  You didn't realize, even in your mind, that it would keep growing until it came out of  you, a human being?  Well, I told my friends, and they told me they'd help me with the money.  After what?  I told them probably...  Six more months?  No, but I was really confused, and I didn't know what to do, and...  But why the joy?  I mean, let's get right into it.  Wow, okay.  Yeah. 
[02:55:00]  I mean, I get it.  This happens all the time, and teenagers and women all over the place are...  With your sex.  ...are like, oh my God, oh my God, what am I going to do?  Do I have it?  Do I have the abortion?  Blah, blah, blah.  But why the joy?  That's the most shocking part of the entire story.  Because I didn't want it.  You didn't want it.  Nope.  But there was no sadness whatsoever that something was growing like you had...  Zero.  That's great.  Did you know anything about your own body and biology and how that works, like the growing 
[02:55:30]  of a baby and things, and that that was a miscarriage, and you did know this?  Yep, and I walked out with a smile.  Did you go to the hospital?  Nope.  See, after a miscarriage, any girls out there listening, I would implore you, you're supposed  to go to the hospital, because the fact that you had a miscarriage means something was amiss.  Yeah, you don't try you.  Nothing was wrong.  You don't dry your vagina off on the hand dryer and call it a day.  You might want to go see a doctor.  Yeah, there we go.  And when you see a head come out of your vagina, you might want to go see somebody. 
[02:56:00]  He's not your twin.  You looked into it, into the toilet?  Yep.  What did you see?  I saw red stuff.  Now, did you see anything that looked like little baby parts?  Did you get like a poker?  Guys, I didn't even look.  I just saw the red stuff and flushed.  Did it have an afro, a little baby afro?  No.  Did it look like you?  I don't know.  Did it have like a gold chain and a medallion?  No.  A gold tooth. 
[02:56:30]  No.  Let's go to Monty in Montana.  Monty.  Hey.  Hey.  Anyway.  Man, that is the most fucked up story I've ever heard in my life.  Yeah, that is hardcore, man.  Thank you.  You are hardcore.  Yeah, absolutely.  I mean, man, I had a-  I would imagine there's people out there that almost drove off the road because they weren't  expecting that.  The laughter.  Yeah.  Let's hear her reaction again to the memory.  I think I got it cued up pretty good here.  My vagina.  And I'm pregnant, so this shouldn't be my period. 
[02:57:00]  So she was like, well, I don't know what to do.  So what I did was I was like, well, maybe I'm having my period anyway.  So I jammed a tampon up my crotch.  And I called another chick.  And she was like, oh, my God, are you crazy?  Take that tampon out of your crotch and just go to the bathroom.  So I went to the bathroom, took out the tampon, and voila, all this red shit came out.  It was the baby.  Oh, my damn. 
[02:57:30]  It came out on its own.  Oh, man.  You were covering up so much pain with that.  Oh, my God.  And the baby came out to the toilet.  Time cheaper, boy.  Getting out cigars that say it's a blob.  That's a way to go, man.  She's telling it like she's on Leno, telling him a story.  Like, Jay.  A story.  And then the craft service guy fell.  And, oh, it was hysterical.  But we filmed.  We finished.  Make a promo out of that. 
[02:58:00]  Oh, my God.  That is, yeah, promo material.  You know.  And can I.  Can I.  Any other woman would have been at least a little bit like, hmm, this was like a part  of me and my baby.  And you're laughing.  There would have been some kind of emotion there.  Any other show wouldn't even air this.  That's what you're going to give you guys.  Oh, my God.  And you're like, whoopee, yay, hooray for your miscarriage.  You can't fake a laugh like that.  I was ecstatic about it, guys. 
[02:58:30]  All right.  Let's go to Chris in Philly.  Chris.  Hey, Tony Bagels.  Hey.  Hey, man.  Hey, Toby.  Give her a show, man.  Well, we don't know what the show.  What kind of show do you want to do, Francine?  I don't know.  I could just tell stories.  I got a million.  Story time with Francine?  Yeah.  We could do that.  Just end them all with, ta-da!  Or happy new year.  Yeah, Chris.  We got to work something out.  She's definitely impressed us today.  Hey, Todd.  Danny and Nathaniel were great, too, man.  Yeah, definitely they were. 
[02:59:00]  All right.  Thank you, Chris.  All right.  John in Utah.  John, what's up?  Yeah.  If you give her a show, Than has got to co-host it to keep her on track.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's not a bad idea.  Than and Danny should sit in.  All right.  We're going to work out something with Francine.  Give her a couple hours.  What the hell?  Let's go to Craig in Florida.  Craig.  Hey.  What's up, fellas?  Hey.  Hey.  I was so distilled by that story.  I'm coming up the floor of the Turnpike.  I found myself doing 20 miles an hour on the shoulder just in disgust. 
[02:59:30]  I couldn't believe that.  That was a surprise to everyone.  We had no idea because we didn't listen to this ahead of time.  Only Than and Danny knew.  And they're like, trust us on this.  This is gold.  All right.  Let's go to Scott in Jersey.  Scott, what's up?  Yeah, what's up, fellas?  Hey.  Fucking psychotic bitch.  Yeah, you guys got to give her a show on Planned Parenthood.  That's all I got to say.  All right.  Yeah, we got to figure out some kind of theme for your show, Francine.  Now, we got a second track here called Francine Has Her First Lesbo Experience.  Is this worth playing after what we just heard? 
[03:00:00]  This one is equally amusing, just in a different way.  I mean, that one was more just disgusting.  This one is more hot.  But equally entertaining.  Equally.  All right.  You want to play the second?  This is a little long, but she sets it up pretty well.  You want to hear this, Anthony?  It's a little long.  Goodbye.  Goodbye.  Goodbye.  Oh, my God.  That's it. 
[03:00:30]  She shot it up.  She stuck a tampon and shook her.  She jumped up and down like a champagne bottle and then popped it out of her vagina.  Yay.  It did hurt for like 15 seconds.  My tummy hurt.  It did?  Aw.  And I took a Tylenol and everything was okay.  I was going to say, did you take a Tums and that was it, right?  She took an acid reflux pill on NXIVM.  All right.  You ready for the second story, Anthony? 
[03:01:00]  Um, yeah.  You know what I'm thinking?  Because I'm always thinking radio.  We should have ended with the first story.  Yeah, we didn't know.  We didn't know.  Who knew that was that?  I just don't think that this is going to have the same pop as the first story.  No way.  But we'll see.  Let's listen to more of Francine doing radio.  So, I was like, I don't see what the big deal is about eating snacks.  You should just fucking eat it.  Now, here's what happened.  Years and years later, I think I was like 22.  Me and this chick were hanging out in the summertime. 
[03:01:30]  Now, we're talking.  Yeah.  So, the house is empty and stuff like that.  And, um, I think she kind of gave me like the weird funky feeling that she wanted to  do something, right?  Like the way she was sitting and stuff like that.  And we were just really good friends.  Until this day, we're really good friends anyway, right?  So, we're on the couch.  And I kind of like leaned over and just kissed her.  And she kissed me back. 
[03:02:00]  So, then, uh, she was like, well, you know, I think if we do this, we should do this right.  She's like, I think I should take a shower.  So, she goes into the shower and she takes a shower, right?  So, I was like, I've never done it before or anything.  And I was like, this is kind of weird, but I guess I could go through with it.  And plus, I think I was in one of those weird bipolar states for like a week.  So, um, she comes out the shower and, um, we kissed again. 
[03:02:30]  And when she was naked or was she wearing a towel?  She was naked.  She came out of the shower naked.  And she has a really cutesy body.  Like, she...  White girl, black girl?  She was black.  Good question.  And she was really cute.  She still is really cute.  This was in Maryland?  No, this is in New York.  Oh.  Okay.  I'm not going to say where.  So...  Uptown.  Oops.  Anyways.  So, I figured, I guess, I've seen enough porn to know what to do from here. 
[03:03:00]  So, I, like, gently, like, touched her breasts and stuff.  And I tasted it.  It was, uh, it was interesting and stuff like that.  But she is, like, a go-getter.  She, like, puts me on the toilet seat, like, where the cover is.  Like, she puts on the cover.  Yeah.  And she goes straight to the box.  Nice.  And she starts to eat me out, right? 
[03:03:30]  So, I'm sitting there, like, wow.  I guess this is good.  Unless she gets her mouth full of baby.  It's not going to top the last story, I'll be.  For some odd reason, I'm, like, I'm not really, like, I was, like, uh, I guess it's nice or whatever.  So, then, uh, we went back to the bedroom after the snatch eating session in the bathroom.  Were you making a lot of noise?  Who, me?  Yeah.  Yeah, but it was, uh, it was okay.  Like, I wasn't.  She didn't do it good enough for you?  She did it good, but I think.  It was fake?  Here, well, here's what I think it was. 
[03:04:00]  I think she was a little bit more into it than I was.  It's almost like you were getting molested or something like that.  Uh, kind of, sort of.  So, so, we went back to the bedroom, and we made out some more, and she ate my snacks some more.  And then, she was like, aren't you going to do me?  So, I'm on the bed, like, I had already jammed my finger up her crotch and, like, did all the ooey gooey messy stuff.  And I didn't really think I wanted to put my face down there, right? 
[03:04:30]  Well, what was the problem with her box, though?  Looks like a Wally.  All right, um, it's just that I'm used to jerking off a guy, and here I am playing with a twat.  I mean, you have one.  It's not like you don't know what to do with it.  You know what feels good on you.  Yeah, but it was a little odd.  It was the first time, and I was like, I didn't really know.  First time?  That means this happened.  No, no, no, no, no.  This was only, actually, first and only.  Is Danny, uh, saying that he'd suck a good cock?  No. 
[03:05:00]  Using the logic.  Using the logic you just used.  He had to think about that for a second.  Well, yeah, well, then, in that case, I would.  Maybe.  Let's suck a fantastic one.  Just had to kind of bring that up.  Maybe Danny should have a show.  Right after Patrice.  We all missed the line, by the way.  Chester's Liver had it from whackbag.com.  She skipped three periods.  English, math, and science.  I must be pregnant.  Show me how you suck a guy to cock. 
[03:05:30]  The last time I'm going to ask you.  Danny.  Oh, all right.  Show me with your mouth.  Back to Francine's story.  This happens.  No, no, no, no, no.  This is actually the first and only time it ever happened.  So, I was like, I was thinking in my head, like, I don't really want to go down there.  Like, this is not my cup of tea.  I like it that she does it to me, and she's like staying on my snatch for like hours, but 
[03:06:00]  I don't really think I want to reciprocate.  So, finally, I give in, and I'm like, ugh.  So, I kept asking.  So, I was like, I guess I'll fucking eat the snatch.  But I was like, there's no way I'm going to eat it just like that.  I was like, hold on.  I got to get saran wrap.  And hot sauce.  Oh, my God.  I couldn't do it.  It was too ooey and gooey in my fingers.  So, what did you do with saran wrap?  So, I put the saran wrap over her vagina. 
[03:06:30]  What the?  This is fantastic.  You fucking put saran wrap.  Do you know how insulting that is?  All right.  That you had to wrap it up like it was trout?  All right.  This is what's going to happen, Francine.  It's going to be story time with Francine.  I hope his brain is going right now.  Oh, without a doubt.  You give us a list of stories you want to tell.  And when we feel comfortable that you have enough stories to tell, you have two hours 
[03:07:00]  on 202, baby.  Because this is fantastical.  And Than and Danny will be sitting in to keep you on track.  Yeah.  Because they did a great job as well.  Can I give a tease?  I raped myself with a dildo once.  Ooh.  Is this cheek?  I've never met her in my life.  What the?  She's normal, right?  Yeah.  Like, she's not like off the street or nothing?  See?  No.  See, this is the problem now.  That's like radio gold.  So, now you're going to probably have to tell that story in a few minutes here. 
[03:07:30]  I know.  After we finish with this story.  I love her.  I love this story.  And I didn't do that.  So, was this after the abortion thing?  Yeah, I was 22.  You're just so, you know, you're just all safe and protection.  But here's, no, no.  Here's, no, no.  No, no.  We've known each other for a really long time.  And I know she's like a health fanatic. 
[03:08:00]  And she was fine with this.  Yeah.  I mean, you said to her, I'm going to go get some saran wrap.  Yep.  And she was like, okay.  No, she's like, she didn't really want me to.  But I was like, I'm not going to.  Here's the thing.  I jammed my fucking fingers up her crotch.  And it's like ooey gooey messy.  And delicious.  No.  All right.  This is the other thing, too.  Although, like, I had a lot of sex in, like, my teenage years.  Right?  Like, after, after, like, 18 or 19, I practically stopped having sex. 
[03:08:30]  Right?  Like, I hardly ever, I just do, like, maybe once every six months to a year, I'll have sex.  Since I was, like, around, probably 19 years old.  Right?  So, my snatch is, like, always tight and small and stuff like that.  And it hurts.  She has a boyfriend.  And I think this guy just goes at it, like, every day.  So, her snatch is a little bit different from mine. 
[03:09:00]  Mine's just the way it's supposed to be, which is what I think it is.  Tight snatch.  And I think hers was a little, you know.  Loosey-goosey.  Loosey-goosey.  And I didn't like the loosey-goosey with the hairy-hairy and all the ooey-gooey.  It sucked.  It had flaps.  And when I went down there with the fucking saran wrap, right?  And I was like, ew.  I was like, I feel for men.  Open sesame.  I was like, I've got saran wrap, and I don't fucking like it.  So, it must be an atrocity for most men to fucking get down there and be like, oh, God, 
[03:09:30]  I don't know what's going to be down there.  And then you get, I didn't like it.  I was like, this just stinks.  Fucking right.  I never did it.  I don't even count it, really.  I'm like, eh.  I didn't do it.  But I did rub her ass.  She had a lovely round ass.  The way you're moving your hand, you twirled it.  Just rubbed it.  You buffed it. 
[03:10:00]  Yeah.  Wax on, wax off.  Because I'm still on this whole saran wrap situation.  Who's, by the way, who's third guy in there?  One of her friends.  Got to go.  Yeah.  Cannot be part of it.  Yeah, he will not be part of the Storytime with Francine radio show.  Mr. Wants Attention guy.  It's not about him.  That's right.  It's about Francine.  You're right, Anthony.  Don't want to hear this guy trying to put in his little hack jokes.  Yeah, well, actually, Francine told me that he's a comic.  What? 
[03:10:30]  Yeah, he's a lot more talkative on stage.  Well, you know, let him be talkative on stage.  Right.  Because he's trying to make a gag every time you say something.  He doesn't have to constantly be talking with every word you say.  Jesus Christ.  Here's the end of the story.  You took a piece of saran wrap.  Yes.  How big of a piece?  Was it just enough to cover, or was it like thigh to thigh?  Good question.  It was probably about this big.  So it was probably enough to go thigh to thigh. 
[03:11:00]  Because I'm telling you, the way I was feeling it, I was like,  there's no way my mouth is going down there.  Fuck it.  And I don't care what she says or what she does.  I don't want to do it.  I think this is, it's a good idea because I wanted the experience of being with a chick.  And it was nice, and I was in my weird little state.  And I think it was a good experience, but I'll probably never do it again.  There it is.  Wow.  Well, that is amazing.  Can I tell another addition to that story? 
[03:11:30]  Okay.  All right.  After that incident, she actually came over to my house when my mom was away.  And she brought her boyfriend, because she kind of, I told you, she's really, really into this thing.  So she was like, my boyfriend wants to see us fuck.  So I was like, didn't you just get it?  I don't want to do this anymore.  Yeah.  I brought out Saran, Rafter.  I got to say, did you put a hint?  A Ziploc on his cock?  And her boyfriend, he was all right. 
[03:12:00]  So I went to the bathroom.  I came back to the living room, and they were fucking in my living room.  The nerf.  Jeez.  Right in your living room.  Right in the living room.  And what did you do?  I was like, could you guys take that to the bedroom?  So they went to the bedroom.  They were probably thinking, yeah, we're all going to the bedroom.  So they went to the bedroom, and I stayed in the living room, because I didn't want to join.  And I watched TV, and I called my boyfriend. 
[03:12:30]  And she came out in the living room in her towel, and she was like, aren't you going to join us?  And I was like, no.  So she had to go back.  Oh, wow.  That must have been an awkward thing.  That's a little awkward.  Is she coming?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Maybe she's out of saran wrap.  Go to the store.  Maybe she went to White Hen.  Wax paper.  All you have is like a blue tarp from over the pool.  You guys, we might have the line of the show from Adam in Nebraska. 
[03:13:00]  We're trying to find a name for Francine's radio show that she's going to do soon on 202.  Adam.  What's up?  I got one.  All right.  Tissue time from the hood.  Yeah, tissue time.  Human tissue.  Everybody likes whacking off to a good miscarriage story.  Miscarriage with braces.  Thank you.  Yeah.  Just a picture of you, all young, with your braces on, miscarrying into a toilet bowl.  But cackling.  And laughing about it.  And flushing. 
[03:13:30]  And flushing it down.  Bye-bye, Junior.  Boy or girl, did you look?  Was there a little peony floating in the mess?  It was just red stuff.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Like liver.  Where's the CD?  Oh, God.  We're going to go.  You know, this is crazy, but we're going to play it a third time.  This is disgusting.  Got to hear her description.  She said a liver came out of my vagina.  This is so perfect.  It's not the whole story.  It's the last minute.  Pretty much right before the big punch line. 
[03:14:00]  We're going to break with this and continue with Francine and Bob Kelly.  Bob, are we promoting anything today?  Torgasm, HBO.  Get the fuck off.  Yeah, we're going to be a nine-episode series on HBO.  Maybe either after The Sopranos or after Jimmy's show.  Holy shit.  Congratulations, man.  Thanks, buddy.  Can we play this real low in the background?  Yeah, of course.  Turn this down a little so it's low. 
[03:14:30]  Yeah.  Happy music.  All right, ready?  Yeah.  We'll go to break with this once again.  Story gets funnier and funnier, Francine.  And she was like, I was like, listen, I got blood coming out my vagina, and I'm pregnant,  so this shouldn't be my period.  So she was like, well, I don't know what to do.  So what I did was I was like, well, maybe I'm having my period anyway.  So I jammed a tampon up my crotch, and I called another chick, and she was like, oh, my God,  are you crazy?  Take that tampon out of your crotch and just go to the bathroom. 
[03:15:00]  So I went to the bathroom, took out the tampon, and voila, all this red shit came out.  It was the baby.  Oh, my God.  It came out on its own.  Oh, man.  You were covering up so much pain with that.  I tried.  The baby came out to the toilet.  A cheaper boy.  Giving out cigars that say it's a blob.  It's time for everyone's favorite game show. 
[03:15:30]  Match wits with a half wits.  I don't get it.  Starring Francine.  As the half wits.  And Master of Ceremonies, Anthony Burt Convier-Kumia.  With subjects like famous women in history.  Do you know who Helen Keller was?  She is barred.  No.  Geography.  What is the capital of New York?  Manhattan.  Wrong, idiot. 
[03:16:00]  And U.S. presidents.  Lincoln, what was his biggest impact on the country as president?  He wore a big hat.  You're what they call ignorant.  Don't let her taunts intimidate you.  I'm book smart.  What kind of book?  I just read a lot of Christian novels.  God.  If you have the slightest ability to retain information, you'll win.  I did really bad in high school.  Away with you.  Away.  Away.  Leave.  Anyone can win at this game.  Right, Francine?  Amen, sister. 
[03:16:30]  What the hell did I miss when I left the room?  Same thing.  What the hell's going on?  I understand.  People enjoy their Xbox and PlayStation 2 games and everything like that.  I am a keyboard mouse control guy.  I like PC games and I like the control that the mouse gives me for aiming. 
[03:17:00]  It's harder to aim with a fucking controller from those games.  I like, look, I know what you're saying, but you can't do, I mean, do both.  And I like the other thing.  How do you turn, how do you, how do you arm things?  How do you turn on your flashlight?  How do you grab different items?  How do you do?  You need a button.  There's 28 buttons on the thing.  28 goddamn buttons.  I'm trying to flip around.  I don't know which is which.  I'm getting killed constantly.  A keyboard.  It's all spelled.  I know exactly where everything is.  I know what the hit.  It's huge, though.  A keyboard is huge.  I know.  It doesn't make sense.  That's great.  It's huge.  A remote is, everything is compact. 
[03:17:30]  I want my flashlight.  You know what my flashlight is?  F for flashlight.  You know what my grenades are?  G for grenades.  Mine is A.  My grenades are A.  It's a lot easier keyboard and mouse.  Ghost Recon on Xbox 360.  Great game.  But he gave his friggin' Xbox back.  I had to.  They asked for it back.  They did?  I didn't bring mine back voluntarily.  I never do that.  Yeah.  I was told by Don Wickland, here, take this home with you.  I go, do I have to give it back?  Because if I had to give it back, I wasn't going to take it in the first place.  Because it's a pain in the ass taking shit back. 
[03:18:00]  So, no, no, you can keep it.  And I had it for like a month or two.  And then they were like, you got to bring that back.  Who's they?  Ah, they.  You know who they are.  There's a lot of they out there.  Wow.  Black people.  They.  Give you free shit.  Yeah.  Hey, let's go to bitching.  Let's go to Bo in Jersey.  Bo, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  While Francine was doing this story, my mom was on the phone with me.  And she overheard the whole thing. 
[03:18:30]  And she laughed harder than Francine did at the story.  I thought it was funny as hell.  Only child, are you?  No one saw that coming.  That's the beauty of that one.  Ty in Texas, what's up?  Hey, I have an idea for Fran's show.  Okay.  It would be Fran, Dan, and Dan's show.  Fran, Dan, and Than.  I don't know about the words.  That's fantastic.  No, Than wants it to be Fran, Than, and Dan.  Ah.  Yeah.  What do you want, Fran?  Fran, Than, and Dan's show. 
[03:19:00]  Wah, wah, wah.  Cody in Indiana.  Cody.  Hi, guys.  Hey.  Another idea for the show that hopefully doesn't stink.  Big Bloody Mess is the name of the show.  And other bedtime stories of Francine.  Big Bloody Mess and other bedtime stories.  Well, as soon as Francine has a list of stories that we think will be good.  I would flush it if you got them.  It'll be story time with Francine.  Nothing.  Nothing, nothing.  All right.  Someone is suggesting after each one of her stories, she yells out, the aristocrats.  Yeah. 
[03:19:30]  That's Don from Jersey.  Don Catlow.  Very good.  Good idea.  We're running out of show.  How long is that story you teased?  The dildo thing.  The dildo story's not that long.  All right.  Why don't you tell us a little bit about the dildos?  Yeah, but you know what I'm thinking?  What?  What if she does it live at the Hard Rock tomorrow in front of an audience?  Oh, good.  Hey, that'd be nice.  Could you pull that off, you think, or no?  Be honest.  Well, honestly, like, I'm really, I actually have, like, a job job.  Oh, you can't be there tomorrow?  Yeah. 
[03:20:00]  All right.  Tell the story now, then.  Damn it.  All right.  I would come, though.  I really would.  Yeah.  All right.  Tell the story, then.  All right.  What happened with the dildo?  Well, here's the dildo story.  I hadn't had sex in a...  Wait, what's the title of the story?  Really Desperate.  Really Desperate.  Okay.  Signed, Really Desperate.  What is it?  What is it about?  You said, what it was about again?  Can you tell me?  Well, I had...  You raped yourself with a dildo?  I raped myself with a dildo.  All right.  That's it.  It was about a year and a half since I had had sex, and I asked one of my girlfriends 
[03:20:30]  what I should do, because I really wanted to do it.  She was like, well, you know, why don't you get a dildo?  So I was like, oh, that sounds good.  So I went down to the dildo store.  The dildo store.  There's a dildo store?  Yeah.  Where is that?  Do you have music for that?  Dildos are us.  Dildos are us.  Dildos are us.  Babes are us, I think.  Babes are us?  I think so. 
[03:21:00]  Sex toys are us.  Yeah, yeah.  Just walking down to the dildo store.  Just had an abortion.  I'm going to go beat myself up with a sword-handed dildo.  Yeah.  You went to the dildo store.  And I went dildo shopping.  Now, how was that?  How did you choose?  What was the criteria for the dildo?  Criteria for the dildo was big and thick.  That's pretty much it.  You wanted it big and thick.  Well, at least normal size big and thick.  What color?  Well, I got a clear one, to tell you the truth.  Clear?  Yes.  I got a clear dildo. 
[03:21:30]  So you wanted to have sex with a ghost?  No, not that I wanted to have sex with a ghost.  You can see the little hand and the little leg attached to the dildo.  Well, it's like getting a black car in nothing.  Okay, good.  Were there any people in the store?  There was a lot of people in the store, actually.  Really?  Shopping?  Yeah, they were all dildo shopping.  More guys or girls or a mix?  It was more girls than guys.  Wow.  And there were books and videos.  All kinds of fun stuff.  And behind-the-counter guy or girl?  Chicks.  They all look like lesbians.  Yeah, they are. 
[03:22:00]  And then, so you picked it out.  You have saran wrap on the vaginas?  Is that how you knew?  Mm-hmm.  Do they have saran wrap on the vagina?  Is that how you knew they were lesbians?  No.  Saran wrap.  So you bought your dildo?  No, no.  First, I had to pick a size of the dildo.  So I looked at all the dildos on the table, and the lady told me, she was like, if you've  never used the dildo, you should probably take this one as a starter.  And it was probably about, let's say, four or five inches.  Aw.  And I looked at it and said, eh, I think I could do a little bigger.  Yeah. 
[03:22:30]  So, uh.  Man up.  I bought a, yeah, that's right, Anthony, I manned up.  Mm-hmm.  And I got this probably about seven or eight inch dildo that was probably about three or  four inches thick.  And I thought it was perfect.  All right.  So I got the batteries.  Did you say four inches thick?  Like.  I don't know.  What is that?  Four inches is this big, sweetie.  Oh, that's really big.  Well, in diameter.  Maybe some comforts.  Yeah.  Then you got to make a circle out of it, Bob.  Yeah.  Oh, I'm not.  Okay.  Thanks, Hope.  You made it sound like it was four inches across. 
[03:23:00]  Yeah, like a square.  Yeah.  Jesus.  Put this in your vagina.  It'll make the perfect fucking circle, you ass.  Makes it a little smaller.  Like an IQ test.  It doesn't fit.  Jesus.  You have a round hole.  All right.  Let's go.  We're running out of show.  So you got the dildo.  Yeah.  So I got the dildo, and I got the batteries, and I took it home with me.  And the lady had given me like these little cream thingies to make it easier for the. 
[03:23:30]  Lubrication.  Yeah.  Penetration.  Yeah.  Right.  Lubrication stuff.  So I got home.  How did you set the mood or set up your room or yourself?  What did you do?  Well, I put on classical music.  Uh-huh.  Why classical music?  A little classical music.  What classical music do you know or have?  Well, actually, besides you guys, I listen to you guys all day and all night.  When I go to sleep, actually, I put on, I think it's that station with a lot of news 
[03:24:00]  in the morning.  And then at night, it turns into.  Classical.  Yeah.  Really?  It's that awful station.  NPR.  There you go.  Oh, okay.  National Public Radio.  So you got the classical music cracking.  Classical music is playing.  You got the dildo by your side.  Yeah.  And I thought I was ready for the dildo.  I didn't think it was too small or too big or anything.  Now, you unwrapped the whole thing and then you're kind of, you took all your clothes off.  Yep.  So you're naked.  You're nude, laying on your bed.  Yeah.  Now, are you getting a little excited at the prospect? 
[03:24:30]  Actually, I was very excited.  I hadn't had sex in like a year and a half.  I was really looking forward to this.  Yeah.  So, um, so I took the lubrication and I rubbed it out around my vagina.  Yeah.  Because I thought that's what you should do.  Sure.  And, um, I took the dildo.  Mm-hmm.  And, um, I tried to jam it up my crotch.  Huh.  Yeah.  Tried to jam it up my crotch.  It would not go in.  Why?  Because it was too big. 
[03:25:00]  Yeah, well, and she hadn't had sex in a year and a half, so.  So her vagina's shrunk.  Sure.  The vagina had shrunk enormously.  Now, was it jamming from lack of lubrication or just pure size difference?  Pure size difference.  You couldn't stretch?  It wasn't stretching, not very well at least.  Gee.  You should have got a hammer.  Knock it in.  Take a few whacks at it with a lump hammer.  Or a mallet from that.  Like a cartoon.  Thump, thump, thump. 
[03:25:30]  A mallet from, what is it called?  Lawn bowling, whatever?  The mallet game.  Croquet.  Croquet.  A little croquet.  Croquet.  I wish.  Yeah.  So you try it now.  You're a little disappointed?  Well, but I'm not going to give up because I refuse not to have sex in that long.  Very good.  I should at least have a fake penis go inside.  Okay.  So I slowly but surely try to jam this penis clear thing up my crotch.  And it's hurting a little bit.  And it's hurting a lot, actually, because it's not really going in properly. 
[03:26:00]  Were your eyes actually pushing out of your head?  Yeah.  It was actually, yeah, it was painful.  Mm-hmm.  So I laid there in my bed and I was feeling a little down about it.  Yeah.  And slowly but surely I got it in.  But by the time I got it in, I felt like I was taking advantage of myself.  And it was vibrating at the same time because it was one of those vibrating dildos.  Right.  So I got this noise going, the vibrating noise, and it's hurting. 
[03:26:30]  So that's how I rate myself with a dildo.  Oh, because it was a lot of pain.  Were you bleeding or chafed afterwards?  No, I wasn't bleeding afterwards, but I did feel like taking advantage of it.  See, I thought it was going to end with her not being able to get it up there, so she  rolled over and jammed it up her ass.  So you took advantage of yourself?  Yes.  Yeah.  You felt like you had raped yourself because it was so uncomfortable.  Did you have a blade on your own neck when you were doing this?  Did I what?  Nothing.  Did you steal your ATM card and take out some money later? 
[03:27:00]  No, I didn't.  But I did do it like, I probably did it for about three months.  I raped myself because I refused to give up.  Good girl.  Yeah.  So I raped myself probably about once or twice a week for three months.  And then I threw it away because I realized it was just too much.  Hurting your kidneys?  All right.  Let's hear it for Francine.  Francine, wonderful.  That gave us a hell of an hour.  Story time with Francine coming to high voltage sometime soon. 
[03:27:30]  Let's go to the phones and say hi to Nighthawk.  Nighthawk.  Yeah, I want to play what I learned on the show today.  All right.  What I learned was when you're having a miscarriage, you hand out a cigar thing.  It's a blob.  Very good line from Stan.  Let's go to Bad Cell Guy from Whack Bag.  Hey, what's up, guys?  I finally learned.  Francine, you are radio gold, sweetheart.  I cannot wait to listen to the show.  All right.  Good.  Story time with Francine coming soon. 
[03:28:00]  Let's say hi to Holly in North Carolina.  Holly.  Hey, you guys are great.  And Francine fucking rocks.  And if you replay the part where she's talking about her miscarriage, she sounds like the  crazy psycho bitch from House of a Thousand Corpses.  A little bit, a little bit.  It's fucking hysterical.  All right.  Thank you, Holly.  Thank you.  Let's go to Zach in Connecticut.  Zach.  Hey, Owen.  What's going on?  Hey, man.  Oh, man.  I'm trying to study for my firefighters exam.  She's giving me a full rod, man.  I can't wait for her show to come on.  All right.  Right on. 
[03:28:30]  Josh in Arkansas.  Josh.  What's up, fellas?  I learned that when any young ladies out there need a miscarriage, just go to a dentist  for some orthopedic surgery.  That's dope.  That's dope.  Pull in there.  Hey, Bob Kelly, what are we promoting today, man?  HBO Torgasm coming out in May.  And you're going to be at the Hard Rock tomorrow?  I'm going to be at the Hard Rock tomorrow, yeah.  Yeah.  Live broadcast.  We rarely do this, so hopefully we'll see a lot of familiar faces tomorrow.  I would get there early because it looks like a lot of people are going to be there.  What, Francine?  I'm going to be at the Village Mall tonight. 
[03:29:00]  Yeah, Mara.  That's it.  I'm out of here. </pre>
