<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a recap of a Patrice O’Neal benefit show the hosts attended.  Numerous comedians performed for free, including Rich Vos, Jay Oakerson, Bob Kelly, Keith Robinson, Bonnie McFarlane, Colin Quinn, Dane Cook, Talent, Harris Stanton, Nick DiPaolo, David Tell, and Bill Burr. The hosts recounted humorous anecdotes from the event, such as repeatedly taking group photos due to missing attendees, and discussed a critical tweet about their physical distance onstage, jokingly referencing their on-again, off-again relationship.  They expressed gratitude for the listener donations.  Mars, a regular contributor, called in to discuss his ACL reconstruction surgery, his religious reading during recovery, and his viewing of *Breaking Bad*, sparking a discussion about the show’s actors, Bryan Cranston and Bob Odenkirk, and their other film work.  A video of a Cuban baseball brawl was shown.  The hosts then discussed Dave Herman's arrest for attempting to transport a minor for sexual activity, New York City's proposed 25 mph speed limit, and the death of wrestler Mabel/Viscera.  A fictional "Cock Talk" segment featuring Mars was briefly described, and the show briefly honored the death anniversary of AC/DC’s Bon Scott.

The show continued with a segment focusing on red light and speed cameras in NYC, fueled by a news story about pedestrian fatalities and Mayor de Blasio's response.  Callers expressed anger towards the cameras, viewing them as revenue generators rather than safety measures, citing hidden locations, inconsistent timing, and inadequate signage.  Sam, a caller claiming connections to police and politicians, corroborated this view.  A police officer caller questioned the fairness of ticketing car owners without knowing the driver. Other callers detailed their experiences with cameras and strategies for fighting tickets.  The DMV's online registration renewal system was also criticized as a revenue tactic.  A listener called in whose friends threatened to kill him if he stopped taking sleeping pills, leading to a discussion about a study linking sleeping pills to increased mortality risk, explained by Dr. Steve.  The segment shifted to a heartwarming story about Kevin, a man with Down syndrome who briefly signed with the Philadelphia 76ers, and a female arena football player who is frequently tackled hard.  Caitlin Farrington, a gold-medal-winning snowboarder, was announced as an upcoming guest.

Caitlin Farrington then appeared in studio, showcasing her gold medal.  The conversation covered her Olympic experience, including the Olympic Village (which she didn't stay in), intense security, and humorous interactions with other athletes.  She discussed upcoming competitions, her fridge magnet collection, and her cat, whom she called an "asshole."  The hosts engaged in crude jokes with Farrington, and callers weighed in on the perceived annoyances of skiers versus snowboarders.

Later, Joe Piscopo called in briefly.  Bill Burr called to discuss the Patrice O’Neal benefit show and his experiences with law enforcement. They also discussed a movie scene they couldn't recall the name of, with several callers offering incorrect titles.  A Kansas bill allowing spanking that leaves marks was debated, followed by a call from a comedian in Shanghai responding to previous comments about his act.

The broadcast continued with a call from comedian Butch Bradley in Shanghai, facing connection issues.  A movie clip was briefly discussed, with Doug praised for his film knowledge.  A significant portion was dedicated to the Kansas spanking bill, prompting a vulgar discussion about child discipline, including personal experiences and potential legal ramifications.  This spiraled into discussions about fetishes possibly stemming from childhood discipline.  Vinny called in with a bizarre anecdote about punching his special education students' testicles ("cock shots").  Big A called, discussing a stand-up benefit and his past, particularly his short-lived marriage to a Trinidadian woman. The hosts then promoted their podcast (focusing on the Patrice O’Neal episode) and a Jim Norton podcast. A phone sex call with Jenna Jameson followed, during which she discussed personal struggles.  The show then shifted to a story about a man jailed for tattooing a giant penis on his disabled friend's back. This led to a discussion about friendship and bad decisions, followed by a discussion about the death of a Devo band member and a playing of a Pearl Jam cover of "Whip It" and a Devo cover of "I Can't Get No Satisfaction." The show concluded with listener requests for mementos and promotional plugs.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  The Ian Anthony Show.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Good morning, everyone.  Hola.  It's Opie and Anthony and Jim Norton.  Yes, indeed.  We had a big night last night.  Was it a shindig or a soiree?  I think it was a bit of a soiree.  Oh, it was a soiree, I think.  Yeah.  It was the Patrice O'Neal benefit.  It was fun.  And it kicked ass.  Holy fuck, did it kick ass. 
[00:00:30]  I think we need to do a virus tour again.  Yeah, a lot of people started saying that.  I think we need to.  That's fucking, man.  And there were a bunch of guys there that I was looking around going,  man, these guys never did the virus tour.  Like David Tell never did it.  Didn't he ever do it?  I don't think so.  Wow, yeah.  And Nick DiPaolo, I don't think we ever got on it.  Really?  Yeah, man.  Nick's fucking fun as shit, man.  He's just fun to hang out with.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, absolutely.  Funny guy, man.  I missed, I was in bed by 10.30 last night. 
[00:01:00]  I missed, I was so bummed because I'm so exhausted.  I missed Nick's set.  I missed Bill.  I missed fucking Dave.  Yeah.  They all, they all killed me.  I know.  No one had a bad set last night.  We had 12 comics, I guess.  Something like that.  Close to that.  14.  Was it 14?  I think it was 14.  Yeah.  They just kept adding names.  Yeah.  14.  Everyone doing between 10 and 15 minutes.  And it was just like boom, boom, boom.  It was a three hour show.  With Rich MCing.  Rich kicked ass.  This is great.  Amazing.  Rich gets a beating on this show and from the fans. 
[00:01:30]  Yeah.  The fucking guy is really good at hosting fucking shows.  It was really amazing.  And every, you know, like you said, 10, 12 minutes.  Right.  He had to be up there.  Oh, yeah.  Doing it again.  We fucking did four minutes and then we fucking socialized.  Thank you good night for us.  Exactly.  Rich is up there the whole night.  Right.  Just killing.  You know, then Bill Burr hands us our checks that we put in our back pockets.  Our checks.  Right.  Wait a minute.  I think I missed that part.  Oh, you missed that.  Don't say anything. 
[00:02:00]  Don't say anything.  That was pretty good.  We're making a killing off this thing.  This is corruption.  No, everyone worked for free last night.  Big time.  It was great.  Worked for free.  And me and Anthony were just discussing that we need to just do benefits.  Like, I think every radio show needs to be, this is a benefit right now.  We're doing a benefit radio show because.  Oh, nice.  Yeah.  We finally figured it out.  The fans couldn't be cooler when it's a benefit.  They are so much nicer. 
[00:02:30]  They weren't heckling.  Nope.  They were laughing a little harder.  They, uh, when they came up, uh, to get a picture or whatever, they couldn't have been  nicer.  Um, amazing.  And it was because it was a benefit.  Yes.  Yeah.  So.  I'm positive of that.  So I'm announcing that, uh, every radio show we do is a benefit now.  Is a benefit.  Let's just call it the Opie and Anthony benefits.  Yeah.  And when we tweet, it's for a benefit.  That's right.  Right.  So, so you could be really nice on Twitter.  Oh, these fucking animals. 
[00:03:00]  There were, it was no animals last night.  No.  My favorite.  You brought it up this morning, that tweet.  Which one?  Fucking asshole.  That tweet.  You and Anthony couldn't be standing any further apart on stage.  Whatever, dude.  What?  Look.  It's a big stage.  We come out.  Look, it's no secret.  Me and Anthony have hated each other over the years.  Okay.  Oh.  But we've also liked each other a lot over the years.  And right now we're in the, we like each other stage.  So relax.  So fucking relax. 
[00:03:30]  It's somebody's Instagram.  It's a huge stage.  And we went out to just say hi and get the thing going.  And, uh, of course we're going to like spread out a little bit.  Yeah.  Why not?  Oh, I think you should have sat down and I sit on your lap like a dummy.  Yeah, exactly.  Fucking, what do you need to write?  I don't think Opie Radio and Anthony Cumia could have stood any further apart.  No, we could have if the stage was bigger.  Yeah.  But that's about it.  I don't know, whatever.  It was fun though, man.  Yeah.  I want to thank everyone that, uh, came out to the show. 
[00:04:00]  They saw a great show, but.  Yeah.  And I want to, I want to acknowledge all the people that wanted to just, uh, send money  from all over the fucking world.  Not just the country, all over the world.  Pretty cool.  Uh, maybe Bill Burke could set something up, maybe a little PayPal, you know, thing for  next year.  Send it to my personal account.  Yeah.  He could launder the money through.  Yes.  Give a little taste to Patrice's mom and Vaughn and whoever else. 
[00:04:30]  Hmm.  So what else about the show?  I don't know.  That was it really.  I missed a lot.  I missed you guys.  I came in because it was, I found out I was not right after the intermission.  So I missed you guys.  Yeah, we did all right.  We did a quick four, five minutes.  Just fooling around a little bit.  I was bummed.  They were right.  I got there a few minutes after seven.  I mean, it was right on time, I guess.  Because.  It had to.  Because any, any minute after 10, you know, the boys, the boys were going to fucking, you  know, hammer.  After 10?  What time did it end?  Right at 10, man.  Oh, it did.  Okay.  Oh, literally on the, on the button. 
[00:05:00]  So it was still, because I went home, I did my set and I, I literally, we did, we took  the photo.  We had to take the big picture right before that.  The, uh.  Who's got that photo?  I want to, I want to tweet that shit.  Maureen has it.  Maureen Taron, but she'll, she'll make sure we all get it.  We got to take it three times.  I know.  They kept, like another person would walk in.  We'd be like, oh, well, yeah, we forgot that person.  Get her.  Everyone get back together again.  Right.  Because Keith Robinson left because he had, he had somewhere to be.  And Colin had to leave.  Of course.  Exactly.  At the end.  Jesus. 
[00:05:30]  And, uh, we took it upstairs and, uh, at first we were like, okay, we got it.  And then we were like, oh, no, no, no, Bonnie wasn't there.  Yeah.  Right.  So then Bonnie finally comes in.  Wait, no, it tells in the bathroom.  Right.  We got to take it again.  And then there was one more person that was missing and we finally got everyone together.  The only one who's not in this is Keith because he, he was gone, but.  Yeah.  Yeah, it was cool, man.  It was, uh, the lineup was, let me see if I can remember, it was, uh, ONA went up and hosted,  which I missed.  Not really hosted.  We just said hi.  We said hello.  Boss hosted.  Not our strong suit, but we did all right.  Jay Oakerson was killing when I came in.  Jay was fucking.  Jay nailed it.  Well, very well. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah.  Rich Voss after us.  Oh, of course, Voss hosting it.  And Jay, uh, who I saw.  Yeah.  I don't know why we don't have Jay Oakerson on our show more.  He's kind of just.  He's good, man.  It was kind of awkward because he kept coming up going, man, you know, that was a lot of  fun today.  And I really would like to do the show more.  And I'm thinking, of course you should be doing the show more.  And I'm also thinking, God damn it.  He just fell through the cracks.  You know, a very wide crack.  Exactly.  But he fell through the wide cracks.  I don't know why.  You know, he fell through the fault lines.  Right. 
[00:06:30]  That was fucking great.  He should be on more.  When he, uh, he got off stage and Voss got up there and goes, let's hear it for Charlie  Daniels.  Oh, yeah.  Big Jay went all in.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  He went dirty.  But he was getting fucking huge laughs.  He was talking about leathery fucking pussy.  Right, right.  Big, hairy, leathery pussy.  Right.  Holy shit.  That was funny, man.  Bobby was great.  I asked him.  Bobby went on.  And, uh.  I'm amazed he was able to go out on stage, you know, considering he brought his kid back.  Family Bob. 
[00:07:00]  It was family Bob last night.  The wife, the kid.  Right.  Yeah.  Did you see him behind that curtain if you were at the show?  Bobby was behind that curtain most of the night just, you know, strolling his kid around  over and over again.  Hilarious.  Trying to get his kid to sleep.  Yeah, his baby's got such cute little cheeks.  He's a very sweet boy.  He looks like a little Bobby head.  Yeah.  A little Bobby head.  A little Bobby head.  Yeah.  A lot of people were saying that.  I like when Bob has his baby with him because he's not a nice person in general.  Bob's an ornery, like a fucking animal. 
[00:07:30]  Yeah.  But when his baby's with him, he's nice.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's in, like, sweet dad mode.  Yes.  So he's a good guy when his babies are.  Yeah, very good.  Who was after Bobby?  I don't know, man.  Who was third?  I wish I had the lineup.  I got it.  Oh, wait.  Somebody Twittered it.  I think Vaughn on Instagram tweeted it as well.  She's mad that we didn't get pictures with her.  But she went into the audience or something.  Yeah, I didn't see Vaughn at all.  I was very...  Let me see here.  All right.  I got it.  All right.  So Rich Voss, Big Jay Oakerson, Bob Kelly. 
[00:08:00]  Then it was Keith Robinson.  Ah, great.  And then it was Bonnie McFarlane.  Who was great.  Both of them were great.  And then it was Colin Quinn.  Who was great.  Yeah.  Then it was Dane Cook.  Dane did great.  Then it was the intermission, I believe, at that point.  And then coming back, Rich Voss started off the second set.  Actually, Jim Norton started off the second set with Rich hosting.  Then Talent.  Then...  Harris Stanton.  Harris Stanton.  That's right.  Nick DiPaolo, David Tell, and then Bill Burr.  Holy shit. 
[00:08:30]  Talent's a really...  I didn't see his set, to be honest with you.  He's really funny.  He's a guy who hosted the Sunday night at Boston, which was the black show.  Talent would host that.  I think he was on...  He might have been on Kiss.  He was on one of the stations here in New York.  But he has a pretty fucking huge following.  Yeah.  That's pretty ballsy calling yourself that.  Yeah, it is.  That is really a ballsy move.  What's your name?  Talent, motherfucker.  Yeah.  But he's funny, though.  He's a really funny, great crowd worker.  Yeah.  He works in extraordinarily rough rooms. 
[00:09:00]  You know.  Yeah, I bet.  Yeah.  He's the guy that does those rooms really well.  So I guess we'll do it again next year.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We'll just keep doing it again.  There's a cool vibe backstage, too, with all the comics and everything.  Because last year was the first one.  Right.  So there was just kind of this underlying, like, sad feeling a little bit.  Right.  It was the first one.  This time, though, I mean, it was more, you know, you've got to celebrate how great Patrice  was and everything.  Dude.  So it was just a lot less somber. 
[00:09:30]  Less sad, yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, I've seen a lot of people die.  The Patrice one, man, I can't totally get over.  That was just fucking huge.  I still can't get over it, man.  When you hear his voice when we play some of his old clips here.  I know.  It just seems like yesterday.  It seems like that voice is still very much alive.  Yeah.  It feels like you can almost go back and change it.  Right.  It's really weird.  Sometimes things in life, you think, if I think about this the right way, I can go back 
[00:10:00]  and fix it.  Yeah.  I can change it.  Oh!  What's up?  What's up, Mars?  Oh, man.  Look who's back in town.  Mars is back.  Look who's back.  How's the wooden leg?  What do you got?  What do you got?  Sex change, right?  You got sexual reassignment?  What do they call that?  Oh, I guess you're going to just take a mic, huh?  Okay.  Instead of a quick hi, I guess you want to talk a little while.  Oh, man.  What happened?  All right.  Actually, I got an ACL reconstruction. 
[00:10:30]  ACL reconstruction.  How did you hurt it?  Initially doing judo and martial arts, and then afterwards just a matter of time and work.  But reconstruction.  So how did they do that?  They took a piece of my patella tendon, harvested it from the front of the knee, removed that,  and put it back in the ACL area, and just screwed it back in there.  Patella tendon.  Yeah.  You don't need that tendon?  Yeah, but they say it grows back. 
[00:11:00]  They say it grows back?  They say.  Yeah, you got to make it strong again.  Yes.  Wait, that tendon?  I'm trying to work, and I'm going to kick you right in the leg.  Oh, man.  With just the foot.  Cream right in the side of the knee.  I'm going to kick your patella tendon fucking space.  Let's see the scars, brother.  I would have to remove my brace and stuff.  Oh, wow.  Get a brace.  God forbid you do something for the show.  That's a visual.  I mean, whatever.  It's a visual.  I understand.  You want to see?  Did you guys get a visual thing going on while I was gone? 
[00:11:30]  Visual element?  No, not at all.  Of course not.  How long were you gone?  A couple days?  30.  Oh, fuck.  Really?  To further notice.  Yes.  You get 30 days.  All I have to say is my knee's fucked up.  Yeah.  Just a patella tendon, and you're fucking golden.  Yeah.  Nice.  I could have even gone further if I took disability, but you don't want to do that.  Oh, man.  Your people like to take disability, though.  That's going to go there, too.  I was like, yeah, well, you're all.  Okay.  Well, they're covered.  Covered.  If you're happy with 75, 80% of your salary. 
[00:12:00]  Yeah.  Sure.  80% to now work?  Oh, I'm good.  Yeah.  I'm not even happy with 100% of my salary.  Good point.  Your salary couldn't drip out.  Fucking one of the greatest lines.  Whoever wrote that, I'd like to just kiss his fingers.  That was great.  Oh, wow.  Doing the right thing and not taking the disability.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's what I'm talking about.  Look at that.  Took sick days and vacation days.  But you should take the disability and then get caught, you know, playing golf or something.  Right.  Bowling.  Something like that.  You know, not the way they're letting go of people around here. 
[00:12:30]  Oh, shit.  What's that about Mars?  Good job.  Come back and badmouth the ball.  Wow.  That's good.  Smart move.  They got them all scared.  Look at them.  Mars comes back.  How many people are gone that you knew?  Two.  In your department?  No, no.  I am.  Talent people.  Well, I think it was more than two.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Those were the headliners.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Who did we lose?  We lost.  Zeno.  Pat St. John.  How long was he here? 
[00:13:00]  What?  How long was he here?  Forever.  Forever.  Yeah, why is this guy swinging a baseball bat?  Wow, Jesus.  A full fucking, like, home run swing.  I think that was in Cuba, right?  Oh, my God.  Yeah, it was a bench clearing brawl and the guy decided, well, all right, I'm going to take  the guy in the head or no?  Trying to take the pitcher's head off.  No, he missed him.  He missed him, but he did a full swing.  Dude, that swing was like he planted his foot, everything.  He was going for the fences.  The guy's head.  That would have been murder if he connected.  That would have absolutely been murder.  Yeah, this clip's everywhere. 
[00:13:30]  Pitcher attacked with bat during wild Cuban baseball brawl.  Oh, horrible.  Crazy motherfuckers.  Wow, they just.  Oh, Jesus.  Wow.  They got him under control pretty quickly.  Swinging a bat.  Wow.  Swinging a bat at someone's head.  Damn.  Yeah.  Very cray.  Well, welcome back, Mars.  Yes, Mars.  Thank you.  It's good to be back, guys.  I miss you guys.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:14:00]  It's good to have you back, Mars.  Yeah, I was going crazy in the house, man.  What did you do?  You can't do shit.  What did you do, then?  Read, play games.  Read?  Read.  You read, John.  What kind of books did you read?  Actually, I had, not that I am, but I had someone give me a book that dealt with the Bible.  Rent boys?  Oh.  And I'm reading it.  The Bible?  No, no, no.  A book that deals with the story of the Bible. 
[00:14:30]  Oh.  Paul and the apostles.  George.  Sure.  And I'm reading it.  Oh, Lord said.  Sure.  And that is a religious thing.  I'm just, because I'm not into that, but as an intellectual aspect.  Oh, okay.  I just wanted to see how people in this religion look.  Jesus.  At the religion.  I thought he was reading some fucking romance novel.  Yeah, right.  He gets all fucking.  Well, he is.  When will the Immaculate Conception?  Get that cock out. 
[00:15:00]  Yeah, get all deep like that, huh?  The one thing I do notice reading these religious books is there's a lot of suffering.  Oh, it's all suffering.  A lot of suffering.  You have to suffer to be a Christian.  Yeah, that's what it was.  A lot of fear, a lot of guilt, a lot of fucking suffering.  They make you feel guilty that you have a penis.  The second someone was having a good time back in those days, fuck you.  Gotta shut them down.  Shut them right down.  Emptically.  Being successful is like, you know, it's taboo. 
[00:15:30]  What's wrong with that?  If God gave you a penis, you should be able to use your penis.  Yeah.  And there shouldn't be rules on how you use your penis.  Isn't there a story in the Bible, too, where there's like a couple of sisters or something  and they need to get pregnant so they get the father drunk and have the father fuck one of them?  That's in there, I swear.  It's in the Bible.  It's like Leviticus or something.  That Leviticus part is pretty fucking steamy.  What is that, Old Testament?  Oh, yes. 
[00:16:00]  That Old Testament shit.  That was some steamy stuff.  He was the hipster of the group.  Right.  Got some shit done.  He liked a good fucking...  So you decided it wasn't boring enough to be out of work and at home that you decided to read just boring books.  Well, I didn't decide.  How about I read Games of Thrones or Fifty Shades of Grey?  Did you do any marathons on Netflix or something?  Yes, I did Breaking Bad.  Oh, there you go. 
[00:16:30]  I didn't see the end of it.  Beginning to end.  Pretty good, right?  Uh, the beginning...  I'll tell you what.  Oh, uh-oh.  God.  I'll tell you what.  This new Mars is opinionated.  In the beginning...  Exactly.  Breaking Bad in the Bible.  Boy, you really fucking covered it, didn't you?  Jesus.  In the beginning of Breaking Bad.  He's going to give us a tell-you-what.  What?  It was all right.  Uh-huh.  It was okay.  Yeah.  It wasn't as intriguing as I thought it would be.  Oh, sure.  A lot of people say that, that it starts off a bit slow.  Yeah.  Third, fourth season on on. 
[00:17:00]  Man, you really grabbed me.  That was like good shit.  Okay.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  So...  Well, I guess that was the whole thing, though.  Him transforming over from just the mild-mannered science teacher.  You see, I'll be honest.  I liked the earlier stuff a little better.  I kind of did, too.  It was cool to see Bill, who's actually a really good actor.  Bill?  Yeah.  And he didn't take me out of it.  Like, even when you know someone so well, and you see them in something.  But Bill's performance was really good, and I already knew he was going to be in it,  so it wasn't a shock.  So Bill's great. 
[00:17:30]  And fucking Odenkirk is fantastic.  Yep.  But I prefer, I think, the storyline of the earlier part.  I did love, I'll say who I loved on that fucking show, was the black guy, what was his name?  Gale?  The chicken guy?  No, yes.  Yes.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Where's it, Gale?  Gustav.  I'm sorry, Gustav.  Gustav, yes, yes, yes.  He, uh, I think he was in a lot of Spike Lee movies.  Yes, he was.  Wasn't he bugging out and a couple other guys?  I remember him in school days.  School days, yeah, he was Julian in school days. 
[00:18:00]  He was actually in Trading Places, too, for a split second.  He was in the jail cell with Eddie Murphy.  When Eddie Murphy's going, I'm a karate man.  Karate man bleed on the inside.  He was one of the other guys in the cell.  No kidding.  Wow.  Yeah, yeah, very young at that time, too.  Very young.  Once in a while, you'll find a guy, like Danny Glover, is in Escape from Alcatraz.  There's a line, and I'm almost positive it's him that says, remember when English, the black  guy is walking around, like, delivering books to people?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  And he's one of the guys in the cell, and he goes, something like, what, did they give 
[00:18:30]  a nigger of his own about him bringing Clint Eastwood around?  And you see the question, it was Danny Glover.  You're like, he had one line in that movie in 1979.  Fuck.  Well, welcome back.  Mars, welcome.  Thank you very much.  Sorry to break up the party, man.  The new intellectual, religious, film critic-y Mars.  Exactly.  That's right.  And a new ACL, too, man.  Yeah.  That's right.  And one less patella tendon.  Are you going to be able to do any more of that training? 
[00:19:00]  Yes, sir.  Yeah.  Damn real.  Nine months.  Nine months will be back?  Cool.  Nine months.  I have to go slow.  Yeah.  Well, actually, Anderson Silva's already fucking walking around.  I don't know about crutches, but you take your time.  You relax.  You see, you fucking simmer down.  Yeah, he just napped his leg in half.  His leg completely in half.  Yeah, exactly.  His leg came off, they had to ship it back to Brazil when he met it there.  You take your time on your fucking patella tendon repair.  Thank you, Jimmy.  See you guys.  And Mars, back with his flashlight in his pocket, ready to... 
[00:19:30]  You were missed, Mars.  Ready to help out.  Exactly.  All right.  There's a pleasant little surprise.  I would say you're right, except for the pleasant little...  It was a surprise I'd forgotten about and could have done without.  Oh, fuck.  Anyway.  We had to keep going downstairs for beer.  That was a little odd.  There was no alcoholic refreshments in the dressing room.  What do you mean a little odd?  Half those guys are addicts in there.  I know. 
[00:20:00]  Most of them.  Who drinks in that room?  Colin doesn't.  I don't.  Rich doesn't.  Bob Kelly doesn't.  Bobby doesn't.  DiPaolo was funny.  He's like, what the fuck happened to my fucking job with these fucking guys?  Because all of a sudden there's gluten-free cookies over here.  I can't get a fucking beer.  Or the food is like, you know, whatever it was.  It was, you know, that kind of hipster food.  Those sandwiches that you're like, what the fuck?  It looks like grass clippings and some kind of cheese.  Some kind of gourmet shit. 
[00:20:30]  I was expecting a ham and Swiss.  All right.  You bring this gourmet shit.  It was like portobello mushroom with avocado.  Yeah.  Yeah.  A lot of avocado.  Slice of shitty cheese.  I just fucking.  And that weird mayo with that.  It's a different color.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Sun-dried mayo.  Oh, sun-dried tomato.  Fused with some fucking sprouts.  Some infusion going on.  I kind of like those sandwiches.  I don't want to make fun of them.  But I had to keep going down. 
[00:21:00]  It was like that episode of Bugs Bunny with Yosemite Sam when he had to keep going to the  ship for one match.  Right.  And coming back and Bugs would blow it out.  Why don't you just do it with one beer at a time?  You should have went to double fist it.  That's what I figured.  And then just keep going down near your feet.  I didn't want to look like that.  And then they get warm.  Yeah.  I don't know.  God forbid your beer gets warm.  You don't like a warm beer, I tell you.  Yeah.  It's, uh, yeah, it was cool.  And then we got to meet a few listeners during that portion. 
[00:21:30]  More people that don't know how to fucking take pictures.  Four.  We took pictures with four people.  Four people.  That was it.  I was fucking lazy.  I should have walked through.  I didn't meet one person.  I usually do a walkthrough.  Yeah.  I was just, but there are those twins from Boston.  Yeah.  They're 22.  How are we making new fans still?  Are they men or women?  Men.  He was, he was, they were saying that they listened since they were like 15.  And then another guy came up.  I drove down from Boston for the benefit. 
[00:22:00]  That's pretty cool.  Another guy came up when they were talking to us and said, uh, yeah, I'm a fan from the  NEW days.  Right.  And then the two guys said, oh, that's before our time.  It's like they listened since they were 15.  Right.  And they didn't even hear the NEW stuff.  Jesus.  I know.  How long have we been doing this?  We're going to get my fucking walker at that point.  Thanks.  You little young bastards.  Almost 10 years.  The show is still very silly and childish.  It's amazing.  It's like.  No, it's not.  Nice. 
[00:22:30]  Hold on a second.  I need to be taken seriously here.  Mature, Jim.  But it's weird.  Like this fucking, do you think it's 10 years?  I told it to be 10 years on this.  10 years on satellite.  10 years.  God, I thought we'd use this fucking place for a couple years and go back to where we  were.  Right.  A little stepping stone.  Right.  Back to, yeah.  Get our feet wet again and then go right back to.  Back to civilization.  Where we were.  No, this exile has lasted for 10 years.  It really has.  But then everybody starts coming over here.  Yeah, yeah.  Everybody starts coming here. 
[00:23:00]  Oh, I told you.  I'm on the road.  And they used to avoid Opie and Anthony discussion.  Look out for the cars.  I just stand there.  I'm playing.  Someone said, go play in traffic.  And it was such a good one.  Oh, skimmy.  But they used to avoid Opie and Anthony discussion.  They don't want to hear it satellite radio.  Yeah.  And now, every interview I do, they're like, oh, how's ONA doing?  I said, like, because they all want to wind up here eventually.  Yeah.  It's no longer a fucking, the death knell.  People, like, that's a real place to go.  You're just fucking, you're locked up on regular radio.  You're fucking handcuffed, gagged. 
[00:23:30]  Can't do shit.  Yeah.  It's terrible.  Get in trouble.  Yeah.  Where's our food?  Oh.  Where the fuck is our food?  You see, Georgia gave us a watch, which was really nice.  Give me the watch.  Really nice.  I put it on my ass.  I'm going right to Macy's and getting that fucking money.  Oh, my God.  That's right.  You ingrate.  I couldn't get, because it's a watch band, I have trouble.  Like, there's a little tag that came with it, but I couldn't get the tag string out of 
[00:24:00]  the band.  I don't know how to work that band.  I know I have to bend it a certain way, but it was all stuck.  I don't know what I'm doing.  That's a catastrophe.  Yes, it is.  No, I looked at it.  I saw where she bought it.  I'm ready to go.  Oh, wow.  Ten blocks from here.  I'll get a nice little refund.  Trading those in.  That's right.  That was really nice.  No, it was awesome of her.  So.  Damn.  That is a fucked up plane.  Oh, that was the one.  Oh, no. 
[00:24:30]  No, that was the one.  United flight?  No, that was the one from, God, why do I have to say this?  Where was it going?  No, I can't.  I saw.  Go ahead.  You can say it.  Hong Kong.  That's a Cathay Pacific.  What?  It was either going to Hong Kong or coming from Hong Kong.  Oh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I wonder what they were going there for.  Oh, I don't know.  Anyway, let's move on.  Probably business and pleasure.  Probably that, Chippa.  I hear you.  I would watch a sporting event.  I don't know. 
[00:25:00]  Whatever.  What sporting event is it?  Oh.  I think there's a big ping pong match going on there.  Really?  Who watches that?  I don't know, but if it's in Hong Kong, it's kind of cool.  Who's playing?  King Kong.  King Kong was playing.  King Kong was in Hong Kong to play ping pong.  Right.  Yeah.  Apparently using his ding dong.  Oh, my goodness.  So I would love to see that.  Hold on a second.  Yes, Chippa.  That's bullshit.  Bullshit. 
[00:25:30]  Just never ends.  We got a gold medalist coming in today.  Oh.  And she better bring the freaking gold medal.  That's the only reason we booked her.  They have to.  Right?  You sure?  I think that's like a thing you have to do when you go on shows after you win.  And then we'll take a picture.  Like we won the gold medal of radio.  Wait, she won.  Nice.  She won this Olympics?  Yes.  And what's she doing back?  I think they come back for a little while.  They do the press.  And then they go flying back for the closing. 
[00:26:00]  Holy fuck.  It's not like it's like, you know.  Yeah, but she won her gold medal, I don't know, four or five days ago.  What are you going to do?  Just fucking hang around Sochi or Sochi or however the fuck you say?  You can hear that little athlete village is like a crazy fucking sex romp.  Well, yeah.  If you want.  Really?  Yeah.  Around there.  I know booze there, though.  I'd hang out.  You would hang out?  Why not?  The week?  Yeah, I bet you.  We'll ask her.  I bet you she flies back for the closing ceremonies.  What's her name? 
[00:26:30]  Caitlin?  Yeah, Caitlin.  Right.  She won the golden women's halfpipe, man.  That's a big deal.  Oh, okay.  That's like, you know.  Is she one of the hot athletes?  I hope so.  Let's take a look at Caitlin.  I don't think you could do like a halfpipe and not be kind of cute at least.  Let's see.  Give us the best Caitlin.  Yeah, she's all right.  All right.  Okay.  I see what's going on here.  Oh, man.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, all right. 
[00:27:00]  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  All right.  Oh.  Oh.  She's cute.  She's cute.  Definitely.  Well.  Very good.  Looking forward to seeing her in that gold medal.  Still waiting for food.  I don't want to start any material because it'll take a while.  I figured we'd clear the field, eat some food, and then we'd start off nice. 
[00:27:30]  We could talk about Dave Herman for a minute.  Oh, you're sure?  He's getting railroaded.  Railroaded.  We worked with Dave Herman at WNEW, and safe to say we did not get along whatsoever.  No.  He seems like a dick.  He was an absolute dick to us.  He was.  But in all fairness to those guys, it was old school versus new school.  Yeah.  We were brought in to make some drastic changes at N.E.W., and that meant those guys were  going to fucking take a hike. 
[00:28:00]  Yeah.  Be fired.  And they all were eventually.  Yeah.  Just about all of them.  Oh, geez.  You don't want that headline.  Wow.  That is just terrible.  They arrested Dave Herman back in October, I believe.  It's been that long already.  In the Virgin Islands, was it?  Yes.  He was convinced that his mom was flying down there with her seven-year-old daughter so  Dave Herman could have sex with the seven-year-old daughter.  Yes.  And they arrested him as he's standing there at the airport with a fucking stuffed animal  for the seven-year-old. 
[00:28:30]  Yeah.  He's a real hunk of garbage.  What a ghoul.  And one of his pals works here at SiriusXM.  I'm an asshole.  Can't wait to see that guy and ask him about his pal Dave Herman.  Anyway, and then Dave Herman proceeded to sue us for millions of dollars.  We were part of a massive multi-million dollar lawsuit because of this guy.  He lost.  He did lose.  And, you know, we were being wiretapped by this person who works at SiriusXM.  Dude, how satisfying, even though it's disgusting, but a guy who was shitty to you and sued you 
[00:29:00]  is now being charged and indicted for trying to fuck a seven-year-old.  Like, what a creep.  There's no crawling out from under that one.  No, that's a big one.  Wow.  That's a big one.  You are fucked.  Why did it take so long for him to be indicted?  He was arrested, and now he's officially indicted.  It's all about legal wrangling.  Putting the case together, yeah.  Right.  So they feel like they got a really strong case, obviously.  Sometimes it's just when the court has room.  Like, you know, the docket's not clear.  They'll say, all right, let's see this.  We can't do it today. 
[00:29:30]  Can we do it tomorrow?  No, how about in March?  All right.  And he's been in jail ever since, right?  I guess so.  I haven't heard anything about him getting out.  I didn't hear about any bail or anything.  I'm sure the bail was a lot of fucking money.  Right.  That's a pretty heinous crime right there.  Was he in the States?  Was he extradited back or no?  Did they bring him back or was he still in the Virgin Islands?  The Newark federal court jury returned the indictment against the 78-year-old former  NEWFM morning host who was jailed immediately after his October 24th arrest 
[00:30:00]  at the St. Croix airport.  Okay, St. Croix.  The once revered, now reviled Herman was charged with a single count of attempting  to transport a minor to engage in sexual activity.  He could get 10 years, which would basically...  That's it?  That'd be a death sentence.  That's life in prison for him.  But 10 years, what?  You do five, maybe?  Yeah.  If you're trying to fuck a six-year-old or whatever, how are you not just getting the  rest of your life in jail?  Yeah.  It's not like, you know, if it's a younger guy, let's say, and he... 
[00:30:30]  does his time.  It's not like he's going to get out and not fucking try it again.  Right.  In the missive, Herman wrote that age six is the perfect time to start her being loved.  Oh, boy.  Fucking loser.  Oh, boy.  They call us shock jocks.  Right?  Really?  Yeah.  That's pretty shocking.  Really?  All those assholes on the New York radio message board that fucking were bashing us and saying  how great Dave Herman is.  There you go.  That's your boy right there.  Yeah.  There's your fucking regular radio guy. 
[00:31:00]  There's your boy.  Then again, there's a lot of regular radio guys.  Wait, what?  Yeah.  Your boy Dave's in trouble.  Your boy Dave.  What?  What?  My boy?  My boy.  My boy?  Yeah.  Well, good for him.  What are they saying on the New York radio message board?  I bet mum's the word.  There are hardcore radio listeners that just love being in denial about shit.  That 1990s fucking message board.  Yeah, what does it say?  Holy shit.  That's just the story, right?  Yeah. 
[00:31:30]  Just quickly go down and see if anyone is...  I know there's people defending him.  Like saying, well, you know, there's two sides to every story.  Yeah.  Anyone?  Well, there's always a rational explanation as to why you said to her, I want to fuck your  six-year-old.  Let's get her some liquor and shut up with a stuffed animal.  I don't think there's any way to take that wrong way.  Sam Towne went already.  I am?  Yeah.  The immediate and obvious question is, if he is guilty, this did not suddenly start two  years ago.  So, if guilty, how did he manage not to catch the attention of his colleagues at least once 
[00:32:00]  with this alleged behavior?  It happens.  So, there was no one at the WNEW air staff or in management who suspected had some clue  or idea?  I did.  You did?  Yeah.  I suspected.  All right, well, that answers that, then.  Fair.  See?  We suspected something wasn't right with the guy.  I knew something was amiss.  Right.  He said, from what several people who worked with him are telling me, no, they had no  clue.  And so, perhaps, this case is without merit. 
[00:32:30]  Oh, God.  Who's that?  Dee Herman?  Yeah.  Well, look, I don't like most of those guys that work with Dave Herman, but why would  they have a clue what he was up to?  It's not something you share with your office.  Right.  What do you think you can do last night?  Well, I fucked a three-year-old.  Right.  How was it?  Well, I got to go out in the air.  I do believe if that's your thing, you're going to keep it under your hat.  I don't think you're going to let that little secret out anytime soon.  How would they know?  They wouldn't. 
[00:33:00]  Just like that, until he got caught.  Fuck.  And why defend him like that?  Like, regardless, if you think, well, you know what, let the legal system run its course  and see what happens.  Sure.  Like, why feel compelled just because you listened to him?  They don't want to believe it.  And, like, you know, what does it, say something about you?  Was that guy a friend of his?  I don't know.  A lot of those guys know each other on the board.  Maybe the guy know him.  But, no, a lot of these people are just fucking, you know, they liked him on the air.  Hey, Dave Herman, rock and roll morning show. 
[00:33:30]  I'm diddling kids.  Is that how he sounded?  I don't even remember what he sounded like.  Sort of like that, yeah.  Like a deep radio guy voice thing.  Yeah, the old school good radio voice.  Dave Herman.  I didn't really respect many of those guys.  Guess the fuck if you got a good voice on the radio?  What are you saying?  Yeah, right.  That's what really matters, I think.  What else you got there, Sam?  Anything else?  Just this one guy who worked with him that says,  If the allegations are not true, I feel sorry for Dave,  because proving his innocence will be difficult. 
[00:34:00]  If they are true, I feel sorry for him, because he's sick.  My thoughts and prayers are with him, in any case.  Good thing you don't care about the little girl he was going to fuck.  Nothing.  Jerk off.  Fucking message board jerk off.  Or the possible previous victims.  We have no idea, obviously, but it seems like this wasn't the first time he was trying  to get something, you know, going.  Maybe it was the first time.  Who the fuck knows?  If he's guilty, and if it was the first time, he has the worst luck in the world. 
[00:34:30]  Right?  All right, we got food.  We certainly do.  Well, we got a new mayor in New York City, and boy, is he trying to get some weird things done.  Fucking commie bastard, this guy.  What?  He's just reading the news.  That's your boy, de Blasio.  Oh, Jesus.  He's the worst.  Yeah, he is.  And they're already saying that people are not liking him.  No. 
[00:35:00]  Like the honeymoon is over here in New York City.  Yep.  Do you think you could get half the shit done he wants to?  I don't know, but New York mayors have been able to get a lot of stuff that they come  up with done.  I don't know.  More than the average politician, certainly.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  All right, we'll tell you what he's up to.  Char.  And it's just good for the rest of the country.  It's for New York City, but when we tell you what he wants to do, you can relate how  ridiculous it is, that's for sure. 
[00:35:30]  Ridiculous.  And Sam, you've got to explain this wrestler who died.  I have no idea who it is.  Uh-oh.  Well, he lost another fallen angel.  Oh.  At least he made it to...  Surrounded by family and friends in his old age.  Yeah.  Well, I mean...  What was his old age home?  Hawaii or something?  He wasn't...  He was not living in a home.  Wow, really?  All right.  Oh, then he must have had a lot of money from his years and years in wrestling where he  could be in his own house.  Right, right.  I mean, that's not implied. 
[00:36:00]  He did wrestle for...  He said you could continue to enjoy your life at a very old age.  Yeah.  Surrounded by grandchildren, great-grandchildren, things like that?  No.  What?  He must have died, you know, doing something he loves.  Right.  Which is kind of cool.  You get up there and...  Sure.  I mean, he was to an older age and died scuba diving or something.  A lot of good memories.  That's pretty cool.  Right.  Guys.  He did.  He wrestled for several years, but he...  I mean, he literally was...  I mean, he was still a wrestler.  He was still a wrestler.  What?  He was not retired.  That old? 
[00:36:30]  Well, because he had to be an old guy.  He's still wrestling?  Well, I mean, you...  He was...  How old was he?  Come on.  Well, he was...  I mean, he was...  Technically, he was 43.  43.  Oh, my God.  Well, that's in wrestling years.  That's like...  Oh, my God.  That's like being 85 in the real world.  Yeah.  Who was it?  Which guy was it?  He wrestled for a while as Mabel, and then he came back...  I remember Mabel.  He's a giant black dude with a mohawk and nylon overalls. 
[00:37:00]  43.  I remember Mabel.  Yeah.  Huh.  And how did he die?  Like, he got hit by a car or something?  Holy shit.  That guy is giant.  No, he had a massive heart attack.  Oh, boy.  At age 43?  Yeah.  Jesus Christ.  He's got a lot of weight on him.  Yeah, he had a bit of weight on him.  Yeah.  He was giant.  All right.  Well, Godspeed.  Here he goes.  Godspeed, indeed.  Yeah, he was... 
[00:37:30]  Wasn't one of the older...  Older guys.  No, no.  Oh, no.  What years did he wrestle?  He was in WWE in 95.  Oh, well.  Until, like...  I do remember him.  Mabel.  But he wrestled, like...  And you guys would have watched him as Viscera, which is when he was a big man.  Yeah, I do remember him.  Yeah, I do remember him.  Viscera.  Beach blonde mohawk.  Right.  All right.  Well, we're going to go eat for a little bit.  We'll be back.  Bye-bye. 
[00:38:00]  Welcome back to Cock Talk.  I'm Mistress Vixen.  Today, we're talking about your first man-on-man experience.  Mmm.  We have Mars on the phone from Puerto Rico.  Mars, talk to me, baby.  I'm a changed man, as of yesterday.  Yeah, I'm a fucking changed man.  I'm not the same.  Mmm.  Mars, I see here you had your first gay experience last night. 
[00:38:30]  Yeah.  Yummy.  So tell me, what was that little asshole of yours like before the big night?  My shit is so tight, man.  I guess I'm anal retentive.  It's so tight.  Mmm.  Sexy.  And what was going through your head when you whipped out that big dick?  He tells me to lie down on my left side, and I'm facing a particular direction.  And then he pulls his apparatus out.  I'm like, hell no, that shit is not going near me.  Sure enough, he goes behind me.  How big was it?  It was, I swear to God. 
[00:39:00]  About two feet long.  Ooh, you're a spicy little bitch, aren't you?  And what did he say before he put it in you?  Did he ease it in?  I'm just feeling for a second, and all of a sudden, this motherfucker, all the way in  my ass.  Ooh, you lucky little taquito.  Tell me more.  He goes like this.  Come on, buddy.  Help me.  Help me here.  Work with me.  Let me do my job.  What was that job?  Open my ass.  I don't know how you guys do it.  Just letting that rainbow-striped freak flag fly. 
[00:39:30]  Come on.  Alcohol.  How do you get alcohol?  This all sounds so dirty.  How'd you get cleaned up after?  Did he do it for you?  Yeah, he cleaned it afterwards.  No, he did it afterwards in front of me.  No, he did.  Ooh, how did he do that?  Uh, what is it?  Toss salad?  You could toss my salad any time.  Ooh, he licked your asshole clean with his tongue?  Exactly.  My God, Mars, you are so naughty.  Any guy would be lucky to go south of the border with you. 
[00:40:00]  This is our secret.  Don't tell anybody.  What I wouldn't give to have a dick sometimes.  Well, tune in next week when Cock Talk returns and we talk to guys about their first time with a down-low brother, Mars.  I bet you have a story like that, don't you?  Ooh, you little Spanish fly.  You've got me all wet.  See you next week for more Cock Talk. 
[00:40:30]  Opie and Anthony are back on Sirius XM.  Let's make it official.  ACDC Day, what do you say?  Ooh, I like it.  What do you say?  Sure. 
[00:41:00]  In honor of Bon Scott.  Vomiting 34 years ago today.  Damn.  And dying as he choked on his own vomit.  What a rock and roll way to go.  He was only 33 at the time.  Ooh.  He would be 67 years old.  Meh, meh.  Meh, meh. 
[00:41:30]  Let me ask the used-to-be-a-youngster, Sam Roberts.  Oh, Sam.  Yes.  Do you like the ACDC?  Yes, I do like the ACDC.  Timeless.  ACDC is timeless.  I think he's just saying that so people don't call him an asshole.  No, I don't mind.  Wee!  I'm used to.  They will anyway, right?  Yes.  Passages.  Uh-oh.  Passages.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Meh.  It's a long way to the town. 
[00:42:00]  If you wanna rock and roll.  Strange early incarnation of ACDC.  Yeah.  Which one did you like or do you like best?  Um.  On Scott?  Both, actually.  Yeah?  Yeah.  A lot of Brian Johnson?  Yeah, a lot of hits with Brian Johnson. 
[00:42:30]  Oh, hell yeah.  I would say both.  I think Brian Johnson has a much more powerful, raspy voice.  Like, it's similar, but a lot more power to it.  And I believe the most popular band after changing singers.  Not many bands can pull that off.  That's true.  Name another band where the singer's gone, whether he died or left,  and the band was just as successful with hits. 
[00:43:00]  Yeah.  I think even more.  Back in Black was such a fucking massive album.  That was a massive fucking album.  Fucking huge.  Yeah.  Some would argue that they became even more popular after.  Yeah.  Yeah.  After the tragedy.  I prefer Bond Scott, though.  Of the two.  I love Brian Johnson, but I do prefer Bond Scott.  I don't know.  What about Thunderstruck?  He's awesome.  He's amazing.  I just prefer Bond of the two.  Yeah.  Little Hell's Bells.  Yeah.  What's a bigger band that had a fucking singer leave or die? 
[00:43:30]  I can't even think of another one.  I think dying is easier because people understand what happened there.  Right.  They're like, there's nothing that could be done.  Yeah.  It's either this or nothing.  And there's nothing we could do about it.  It helped.  Yeah.  Travis reminded me.  Of course, Van Halen.  Oh, right.  But that was like two different bands, though.  Were they bigger without Dave?  I don't think they were bigger without Dave.  Well, that's the big argument.  That continues to this day.  What's that?  They stayed.  Yes.  But they weren't as big.  I think ACDC plays Giant Stadium.  Right.  ACDC got bigger, yes.  30 years after Bond Scott died, they absolutely got bigger. 
[00:44:00]  Yes.  Yeah.  But Sammy Hagar kept the Van Halen thing going.  Yeah.  Pretty well for many years.  Marvin and Sherberts were never the same.  No.  The Sherberts?  What do you got, Travis?  I was talking about Sammy Hagar into Gary Cherone.  Oh, wow.  Oh, wow.  You had to bring that up.  That was a bust-a-roo.  You think so?  Roo tile.  Yeah.  You don't like the radio in the ice?  And Gary Cherone's a really good dude, man. 
[00:44:30]  He deserved better than that.  If you want to rock and roll.  Fuck.  Well, that's about it.  I can't think of anyone else.  Yeah.  So we got a mayor here in New York City.  Ugh.  He's extremely, an extreme lefty.  And he wants to slow cabs down.  Yeah.  Why?  Well, people die on the streets of New York. 
[00:45:00]  But the numbers are pretty good, if you think about it.  When you think about how many people are crossing the streets in New York City.  Wow.  There are people crossing the streets in front of cars pretty much every second of the day.  Amazing.  And we only lose about, I don't know what the exact number is, but it's not even 10 a year.  It's not even 10 a year.  But, you know, you've got to save everybody.  Of course. 
[00:45:30]  So now everyone's got to suffer because we have lost a few.  Yeah.  And we've lost a few in a couple-week period.  That's never good.  Yeah.  So now de Blasio wants to slow down cabs to 25 miles an hour.  Cabs or everybody?  Right.  It's got to be everybody.  Oh, everybody's saying?  I don't think you could just slow the cabs down without slowing everybody down.  Let's see.  He wants to put the brakes on lead-footed New Yorkers by knocking down the citywide speed limit.  Okay, yeah, this is for everybody.  From 30 miles an hour to 25 miles an hour. 
[00:46:00]  Part of a sweeping plan to reduce pedestrian deaths.  So what are they down to?  Nothing.  Well, you know what this is really about, right?  Don't be tricked.  It's just another way to get fucking tickets.  To the people.  This is always bullshit.  You find a little something, a little loophole, you fill that loophole, which means you can  now give away way more tickets.  More tiki's.  Has anyone ever liked a politician who's lowered the speed limit?  Has anyone ever said, I love that guy?  Yeah.  He made us go slower. 
[00:46:30]  Right.  Fucking idiot.  It's about each of us taking great responsibility every time we get behind the wheel or step out  on the street, de Blasio said as he unveiled the plan dubbed Vision Zero for ending pedestrian  deaths.  How about if the pedestrian stays on the fucking sidewalk before the walk sign comes up?  Right.  I love that they walk out.  They're standing in what amounts to a lane of traffic.  They have to go off the sidewalk and stand there and wait for the fucking thing. 
[00:47:00]  And you're trying to make a turn and you can't get between the car and the guy because the  pedestrian's in the middle of the fucking road.  It's ridiculous.  It's usually the pedestrian's fault.  Shut it.  Just about.  This is about bringing in even more revenue for the city, period.  Because now the cops can pull you over for going 28 miles an hour even, I guess.  The interagency task force that has been studying the streets for a month came up with a number  of recommendations, including reducing the speed limit, an action that requires state 
[00:47:30]  approval.  City officials said the likelihood of a fatal crash declines significantly for speeds below  30 miles an hour.  A bunch of grandmothers driving around, toot, toot.  They've already taken lanes away.  Yeah.  And the fact is, it's really hard to go 30 miles an hour in the city.  It really is.  So when you do get a stretch.  And every once in a while you get, you want to like take advantage of the stretch.  Expanding the use of speed and red light enforcement cameras. 
[00:48:00]  Oh, there you go.  There you go, exactly.  They just want to bring more fucking money in.  And they want to grab it from our fucking pockets.  Those fucking red light enforcement cameras are enraging.  They're enraging.  I wonder if shithead de Blasio's, who is it, the state police who drive them around.  I wonder if they will be as enforceable as everyone else.  I wonder.  Well, no, we can't adhere to that law. 
[00:48:30]  It's a security issue.  They'll come up with some reason why he doesn't have to adhere to it.  Currently, the city can deploy red light cameras at 150 intersections and speed enforcement cameras at 20 intersections.  In a city with more than 6,000 miles of streets.  Installing 250 speed bumps.  They want to install speed bumps?  Installing 250 speed bumps and enhanced lighting at 1,000 intersections.  It'll go well during the winter when they're plowing up the speed bumps. 
[00:49:00]  How about you fix the fucking holes in the road that are there?  Plenty of speed bumps now.  Don't worry about it.  We want everyone who gets behind the wheel of a vehicle to think carefully about the situation they're in, in the densest city in the nation.  They already think that shit.  We want pedestrians to think carefully.  This is very much about raising consciousness and changing behaviors.  I would bet a lot of money that most of the pedestrians that are killed in New York City, it's their own fault.  And then every once in a while you get one of those cabs that go flying off the fucking road on a sidewalk, of course. 
[00:49:30]  But I bet you most of the death is because people are like, you know, peeking out and don't have the patience to wait or whatever, and they get fucking caught.  Here's another thing people do.  It says don't walk.  And I understand sometimes you take a look, there's no cars coming, and you cross even when it says don't walk.  That's fine, but I've seen people that look, they see they have just enough room to make it, they step off the sidewalk, someone behind them, not even looking, just follows like a sheep, that guy, and then you get a bunch of people starting to cross when you're barreling down on them. 
[00:50:00]  They don't look.  And what they want to do with the cabs is annoying, too, to fucking cut down pedestrian injuries.  He's turning the meters off if it doesn't, if you go over the limit, the meter shuts off.  Right.  What?  That's what he wants for the cabs.  If you go over the speed limit, the meter shuts off.  And there's the thing that tells the passenger, you're going over the speed limit. 
[00:50:30]  We know, idiots, we want them to hurry up and get us there.  Yeah, we're the ones that are saying step on it.  What do you think and step on it means?  Of course.  Eleven New Yorkers have already been killed in traffic accidents in the first two weeks of 2014, including seven pedestrians.  So that number's a bit high for the new year.  Mostly Asian?  Is it mostly Asian?  Let me see here.  I'll tell you.  Every time I hear about these people getting hit, there's a lot of Asian people getting run over.  Right.  Got to be honest.  De Blasio's action plan appears to shift the focus on drivers and enforcement and away from jaywalkers 
[00:51:00]  who were targeted in an ill-fated ticket blitz just weeks ago.  Ill-fated ticket blitz?  Well, they've been giving out a lot of jaywalking tickets in the last few weeks.  So basically, people are jumping out the window, so his thing is, let's lower the buildings.  Right.  Fucking asshole.  Just a fucking asshole.  Let's take those top floors out 30 miles an hour.  30 miles an hour is not too fast anywhere.  No.  If you're paying attention as a pedestrian, 30 mile an hour speed limit is very reasonable. 
[00:51:30]  But he doesn't give a fuck about the individual and their safety.  No.  These politicians, they come in and they try to figure out revenue streams, period.  So then you get on the news that there's more people getting hit by cars than in recent months or years,  so then they're like, ah, there we go, we got it.  Now we can throw this in there and make more money.  Now we can do this, this, and this, and we can make more money.  It's always about making money first.  It has nothing to do about individual safety.  Period.  You don't think they care about the safety?  No! 
[00:52:00]  I never believe that.  It is pretty much everything the advocacy community has been asking for, said Keegan Stephan,  an activist with the group Right of Way.  Ew.  Ew.  Right of Way.  You're an activist with the group Right of Way who wanted to see an even lower speed limit.  And I'm especially grateful that de Blasio focused on the personal responsibility of drivers.  What are you going to do? 
[00:52:30]  Not pedestrians, though.  They have no responsibility.  They can just fucking traipse out.  They can do mini the mooch in the middle of the intersection.  And if you honk at them, you're an asshole with noise pollution.  Gotcha.  All right, here we go.  We got Sam in South Plainfield losing his mind on the phone here.  Go ahead, Sam.  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  How you doing?  Oh, a little tired today.  We had a nice benefit last night for Patrice O'Neal's family.  Yeah, yeah.  I know.  I heard that went well.  Absolutely.  A couple things about these fucking red light cameras and the speed track. 
[00:53:00]  Originally, they were brought on to protect the intersections that they did studies on,  where, like, a lot of people were getting fucking T-boned and people were making a left turn.  That's my nickname, actually, T-bone.  T-bone!  Right.  Yeah.  Anyway, now they're doing them just, I mean, a lot of my buddies are cops or in politics,  and it's just a fucking money pit.  And they're doing them at these right turns where, you know, you drive through.  Nobody stops at a fucking red light when you're making a right turn. 
[00:53:30]  I do.  Full stop, my friend.  Let me tell you why it's all bullshit.  They put these cameras in because they're dangerous intersections, like you're saying.  That's how these things started.  Yeah.  But there's no real sign that there's one of these cameras at the intersection,  because they want to catch you to give you your fucking ticket.  So it's not stopping anyone.  So they're not even making the intersection that much safer.  That's true.  The excuse is we've got to put the camera here because it's a dangerous intersection.  But wouldn't you put a huge sign like, warning, we've got a red light camera up ahead? 
[00:54:00]  Right, because that would make people really stop.  See, you have no idea until your pal tells you, hey, on Blah Blah Street, you know, there's a red light camera now.  And you go, really?  And then the next time you go through that intersection, you look around and go, son of a bitch, it's right there.  And then you get the ticket and you get a link to the video and it shows your car.  Right.  And even if you did stop, you have to go to court to fight that.  Take a fucking day off work for the judges to say, oh, yeah, you're right. 
[00:54:30]  You know, you did do the stop.  But the point is, yeah, they're not officially making those intersections any safer.  If you don't know the cameras are there, how does it make it safer?  The speed camera, the speed camera, I got hit with that a couple times.  The first time I saw it was in D.C., the second time in Rhode Island.  I mean, you're just taking a job away from a fucking cop.  You know, I guess it would be dangerous to intersect the cameras, but a speed camera, man, do your fucking job.  Come on.  That is purely for making money.  Yeah, of course.  You're right.  They would put a sign that says.  Of course.  Yeah.  Of course.  It just makes me livid, man.  But, you know, thanks for taking the call. 
[00:55:00]  I appreciate it.  I don't buy into a politician's bullshit.  The new guys, they come in and they got to find their revenue streams.  Oh, yeah.  That's exactly what is happening.  Way to make their, let's go to Chicago.  Lucas, what's up?  Hey.  Yeah.  You're still on that second floor or did you finally move?  I'm in Chicago.  The tickets are ridiculously expensive.  They're doing it in Chicago?  Yeah.  Yeah, it's a new thing.  You know. 
[00:55:30]  I think I got tagged with one the other day and I'm just waiting for my ticket.  I got one recently, too.  And it's like, in my neighborhood, there's one really close to us.  And I forgot.  It was like turning yellow.  There was plenty of fucking time to get through.  Technically, yes, I went through a red.  But there was no safety issue whatsoever.  It beats getting, thank you.  It beats getting pulled over, though.  And it beats getting points.  That's the only good thing about it is there's no points.  Most cops are going to pull you over as you're going through a late yellow. 
[00:56:00]  That's true.  It was a late yellow.  But, I mean, the camera, you know, picks it up as a red, obviously.  Sometimes that yellow lasts pretty long.  You're like, hey, I'm surprised I made that.  Oh, no, this fucking intersection, it's a short.  Short yellow.  It's a short yellow.  I'm saying late yellow, but it was yellow when I decided to go.  But they know.  Keep that yellow short.  Keep it quick.  They're scumbags.  Fucker.  Virginia has the warning signs.  Okay.  Go ahead, Jim, in Virginia Beach. 
[00:56:30]  Hey, guys.  How's it going this morning?  Hey.  We got them down here at the busy intersections, and it does say photo enforced on signs with  the red light, the picture of the red, yellow, green light on the yellow sign.  And at the bottom it says photo enforced.  And we got people fighting it all the time.  They just went to the general assembly, a lady did two weeks ago, to fight it, and she  lost.  You know, they said it is what it is. 
[00:57:00]  But the signs are pretty obvious that up ahead is one of these red light cameras?  Yes.  See, not in New York, man.  They're all fucking hidden.  So I don't know how that is making those intersections safer.  Yeah, it's been a debate since they've gone in, and they're talking about putting more in.  We got 13 of them in the city right now.  And like I said, they're taking in money.  That's the biggest thing.  All right, brother.  All right, Jimmy.  Looking forward to seeing you in March, man.  We got tickets.  We're going to check you out on Saturday night. 
[00:57:30]  Oh, you're in Ontario?  What's that?  Ontario or Virginia Beach?  No, no, no.  In March.  March 22nd, when Jimmy's down here at Funny Boone.  Oh, Virginia Beach.  Okay, thank you.  Funny Boone.  Thank you, brother.  Virginia Beach.  I appreciate it, brother.  Get down to a nice beach place.  Man.  I do a little sunny.  Let's go to Buffalo.  Rob, what's up?  What's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey, I'm a police officer for the last 12 years, and those cameras are ridiculous.  Oh, of course they are.  You guys know it. 
[00:58:00]  Of course.  If you think about it, if you're driving your car, how do you even know that's who is driving  your car when you run through the red light?  Well, how can you, in good faith, give a ticket to the driver that you don't know who it is?  Well, that's why they don't give you points on it.  Right.  But it's like, hey, your car went through it, so you're paying, so we don't give a fuck who  was driving.  Yep.  Crazy.  It's all over.  It's getting worse.  Yeah.  We got groups fighting back, right?  Yeah.  Where they were able to keep the number of red light cameras down. 
[00:58:30]  Yeah, but...  But they're slowly losing that battle.  Yeah, definitely.  There's too much money at stake.  They love making their money like that.  I bet you they would love to put one of those cameras on every intersection.  The amount of money they would make, holy fuck.  That, the fucking parking tickets that they give out, it's just huge amounts of money.  Dude, as soon as you step out your door in New York City, people are waiting to get you.  They're just waiting to get you.  Hands in your pockets.  They're just waiting to get you. 
[00:59:00]  Yeah.  They just started giving a shitload of jaywalking tickets out in recent weeks, because that  was part of the de Blasio thing.  De Blasio likes that wealth redistribution thing, so he figures, you know, you pull over  some people.  If you're driving in the city, you could afford the ticket, and then he'll put it towards some  program.  Well, that's where I don't mind as much if all the money was going, you know, towards some  good program, but there's so much corruption and bullshit, they don't spend our money properly. 
[00:59:30]  Yeah.  Bastards.  Bastards.  They can't make budgets.  No.  They can't balance their own books with the amount of money they bring in.  It's a constant fucking ... They can't figure out how to spend your money more.  More of your cash.  They can't figure out how to fuck you more.  Stupid me, man.  You walk through life, and you go, they have enough money. 
[01:00:00]  Yeah.  Whether it's in your city or for the entire country, it's just mind-boggling.  Yeah.  They have enough money, and then they don't have enough money, because they can't figure  out how to spend it properly, so then they have to go and get more from us.  We need more of your keys.  How do they not have enough money at this point?  Yeah.  It's unbelievable.  Fuckers.  Calling about red light cameras.  Everyone is about this.  All right.  Let's say hi to William in North Carolina.  William. 
[01:00:30]  Hey.  Billy.  I drive a truck for a living, and I have one of them prepaid lawyers you pay every month  for a legal service.  Any time I get one of them tickets, I just call them up.  They write to the court that they're going to plead not guilty, and they want to face it.  The accuser.  I've heard that defense.  Yeah.  Nine times out of ten, they just drop it, because it's too expensive to take it to trial. 
[01:01:00]  Seems like it's working for this guy.  I've heard that, though, and I've heard it doesn't work.  Why do you have a lawyer on standby?  Is that just on retainer, sir?  I mean, it's only, you know, $60 a month, and the amount of tickets, you know, you get  one ticket against your license, and the way the scores are nowadays, it's hard to keep  a job or, you know, get another job if something happens.  It's, you know, just, for me, it's the right thing to do. 
[01:01:30]  Right on.  All right.  Well, they kill the delivery trucks with tickets every day.  We've discussed that as well.  I don't know where these guys are supposed to park to deliver our goods.  I do hate when they fucking double park.  Well, every once in a while you do, but, I mean, they have to deliver their shit.  More so than hating the double parker, though, I can't stand the people that are in front  of you in their car with no fucking idea of the parameters of their own vehicle.  Right.  That they can fit through the space that's open, but they sit there. 
[01:02:00]  Do you beep?  Like, oh, do I beep?  Oh, do I beep.  You wish I had a tank at that point, right?  I don't even go beep, beep anymore.  I'm, bam, I lay on the fucking horn and don't stop until they start moving.  Do they ever look in the mirror like, eh?  Oh, do they ever.  I am hated.  Yeah, when you get one of these delivery trucks double parked, it is a pain in the ass.  But what are they supposed to do? 
[01:02:30]  Yeah.  There's no parking spaces for those trucks.  And the city knows that.  So they pull over.  These guys do try to pull over in a way where they're not fucking up the traffic too bad.  They try.  And then the traffic cops come around and give them tickets all day long.  Over and over again.  I have a solution for that.  You know how, like, a garage will have a built-in, like, a thing that you raise a car up on to work on the undercarriage?  They should have those all over the street.  So when someone's delivering, they take their delivery, then they raise the truck on that thing. 
[01:03:00]  Oh, there you go.  And everybody else just zips around them.  I like it.  That would be so expensive.  That would be a lot of work.  They'd break down, trucks would get stuck.  That would be a mess.  That would be a mess.  Yes, it would be.  You want to put something on GPS where if you go above 55 miles an hour, you automatically get a ticket sent to you in the middle.  Yeah.  That's where we're heading with all this.  Yeah.  You know damn well that's where all of this is heading eventually.  Did you see the, like, Progressive has that little thing.  I want to say chip. 
[01:03:30]  What's that?  That you put in your vehicle.  To save on your insurance.  To save on your insurance.  That's not what that's about.  Driving thing.  Go tell them, man.  What a load of shit that is.  Go tell them.  They think, oh, so you have this thing.  To save what?  Ten bucks?  Right.  Well, you'll save money.  What are the savings in the end?  The second you have a fucking accident, that thing is downloaded.  Right.  And they will see what your speed was when you applied the brake.  Right.  Yeah.  With the G's of the turn you made.  Like, everything.  They're using those things against you.  It's like a cockpit voice, a data recorder. 
[01:04:00]  And they're using it against you.  But under the guise, that's there to save you money and help you out.  Insurance companies want you to pay into the system.  And in the end, they don't want to pay out a fucking dollar.  I'm having a little battle with my insurance company right now about my auto insurance.  Really?  Yeah.  They fucking are canceling it.  Why?  Too much shenanigans.  Oh.  Too many shenanigans on my fucking record of late.  Really?  Yeah.  Well, I have a speeding ticket that's coming off soon, but it's still on there. 
[01:04:30]  So that combined with an illegal lane change ticket, combined with an accident I had in  the Mustang, and then combined with the latest, the cab that hit Kenny when he was pulling  the truck around.  It's not his fault, and it even says, not at fault.  Right.  But they sent me a letter saying, yeah, we're not renewing your fucking policy.  They've had enough of your shenanigans, huh?  Yeah, but I've paid in. 
[01:05:00]  Right.  I've paid the fucking premiums.  That's true.  And then, so I called my broker, and they're like, oh, yeah, we're going to have to send  us your driver safety course certificate.  Remember that thing I had to take?  Send us that, and we'll get another carrier.  Insurance company.  And then she goes, well, you know, I can't guarantee that the premiums are going to be  the same.  I'm like, I don't care.  Just give me some insurance.  Just get me some fucking insurance.  Pronto.  I needed insurance.  Well, you fuck, I drive. 
[01:05:30]  I pop wheelies.  Yeah, but you've got to think, Ant Sober.  Slow on booze, enjoy the road.  Oh, is it slow on booze, enjoy the road?  You don't like that?  Oh, no.  In north of Virginia, they weren't making money on the red light camera, so they changed  the timing of the yellow lights.  Yeah, they fuck you up with the yellow lights.  I'm telling you.  Shouldn't that be consistent?  Like, yellow light speed?  Every yellow light should be the exact same. 
[01:06:00]  It's different.  There should be, like, a consistency so you know.  That should be the law.  Yeah.  The yellow's going to be for three seconds or whatever the fuck.  I understand some, I think some intersections, you need a longer yellow because, just to  get across it.  Right.  A big intersection or something like that, but I don't know.  Let's go to Jen in Brooklyn.  Jen.  Hey, what's up?  Hi.  Hey.  Hey.  Oh, welcome to Brooklyn, man.  I get, like, almost hit by cars every fucking day.  And, no, I'm not all about, like, big brother and cameras and stuff, but I get the most satisfaction 
[01:06:30]  watching those lights go off and then see some asshole get a ticket.  But you're the problem.  Why are you almost getting hit every day, Jen?  Why?  Dude, dude.  I'm a dog walker.  I walk every day and I just, you know, the light goes off and I, you know, I'm careful  because there's no one else's dog I'm walking.  And then this asshole will take a right or a left and he'll just, you know, like, he'll  just sometimes stop right in front of me and then start to, like, slowly wheel towards  me as I'm trying to cross this fucking street.  And I don't give a shit, dude.  I mean, I don't want to depend on this guy's reflexes to see how fucking, you know, on 
[01:07:00]  time he is about stopping.  But you're saying, you're saying you almost get hit every day.  Every day.  That's crazy.  That sounds like your fault.  That's what I'm saying.  It's got to be your fault after a while.  Oh, man.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Okay.  So, you know, I walk out like a street.  Wait, I walk the streets probably just as much as you.  I'm not getting almost hit every day.  You know why you walk the streets as much as me, dude?  You're a rich dude with a fucking car.  You don't walk.  Oh, no.  Shit.  Damn.  God damn it. 
[01:07:30]  A rich dude with a fucking car.  Fuck.  That's right.  That's what it said under my singles head.  You dog walker?  Yeah.  No dog walkers.  Yeah.  That's the only thing, too.  People fucking hate dogs, and they give me nasty looks, and then people try to hit me  with cars, and it's a fucking shit.  Damn.  You know, panicky.  People love dogs.  Right.  Yeah, exactly.  Oh, yeah.  They love their shit, too, and their piss.  Wow.  So you reward them with a nice dollop of peanut butter?  Exactly.  The angry dog walker. 
[01:08:00]  It's everyone's fault but yours.  Why don't you settle down, Jen?  What do you think?  What do you think her problem is?  Why is she almost getting hit every day?  She probably walks around just giving everyone the middle finger as she walks.  Yeah, she sounds angry.  Right?  You sound like an angry chick.  I hit my kick cars.  I give them the middle finger.  I call the Jews fucking Jews.  Say.  I'll fucking wear that.  Josh, what are you doing?  I'm sorry.  She probably has a dog asshole fetish, and she can't stop looking at them as they walk  ahead of her.  All right.  They're little puckered assholes, and you're walking right into traffic.  Stop looking at the dog's assholes. 
[01:08:30]  Careful, Jen.  All right.  Thank you.  All right.  Thank you.  Bye.  This guy is begging to add something to the red light cameras.  He even wrote, is saying, please take my phone call.  Dan in North Carolina.  Go ahead.  Hey, guys.  How are you doing?  Good morning.  In the city of Charlotte, they had those lights everywhere, and the companies that came  in and installed all those things gave all the equipment to the city of Charlotte.  The maintenance fees that were involved with these things cost more than the actual tickets 
[01:09:00]  they were getting in from them, so all the money that was coming in from these red lights  were all going to the company who supplied all the camera products and everything like that.  So they weren't even making money off them.  They were making nothing off them, so the city of Charlotte ripped them all out and said,  forget it.  We're not doing it anymore.  Oh, good for them.  Bravo.  Thank you for adding that.  They probably make money here in New York, but there's so many.  Dripping with sarcasm.  Thank you for adding that. 
[01:09:30]  Amazing.  Some people think they cause more accidents.  I believe that, because then when you do remember that the red light camera's there,  you're jamming your brakes drastically sometimes.  Get hit from behind.  People here are suing the city for the cameras because they don't display it anywhere.  Yeah, you gotta fucking let people know that these cameras are there,  if they're using them to make the intersection safer.  But why do you have to tell people?  What's the legality behind that?  I guess you don't officially, but if you're trying to tell the people of your city that 
[01:10:00]  you're installing these cameras to make these dangerous intersections safer,  but you have no idea that these red light cameras are there.  By the time they send you a ticket, it's already too late.  You already went through it fast.  How is it making the intersection safer in the end?  Oh, it's not.  Okay.  What it should be is like, red alert, we got a red light camera,  because this intersection is dangerous.  That would make everyone go through there a bit safer.  Exactly.  But they don't want you to know the cameras are there.  So it's this little dance they do. 
[01:10:30]  Oh, yeah.  What else is de Blasio up to besides that fucking shit and the speed limit  and taking everybody's money and giving it away?  I don't know.  Regular Robin Hood, isn't he?  Yeah.  We got a new scam.  I love when we learn about new scams.  Anthony in Staten Island, what's the new scam?  Right here.  Hey, guys.  Good morning.  Hey.  Oh, you were right, man.  It's all about generating a new revenue stream.  The latest one that I noticed, and I was a victim of it, 
[01:11:00]  what the DMV has done in New York City  is they stopped sending paper registration renewal notices.  And what they want to do as a result is they want to move everybody to the MyDMV website  so that you can renew your registration online.  So by not sending the paper notification,  which most people would rely on as a way to kind of remind them  that they have to renew their registration,  lots of people their registration would expire and they'd get a ticket.  Right. 
[01:11:30]  So the timing of that was interesting.  I think you could agree.  I do kind of like that online shit, though.  It is easy.  But you got the reminder in the mail, though, like, oh, fuck.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I understand what he's saying.  Yeah.  Now it's just like...  And they're obviously assuming that most people without the reminder are going to let it, you know...  I just got my license renewal thing in the mail.  But he's saying that's going away.  Well, then, how are you supposed to...  What, you're supposed to know that...  That's what I'm saying.  ...is your expiration and you've got to go to the website? 
[01:12:00]  Yeah.  Wow.  And they'll obviously catch a lot of people that way.  Catch a motherfucker slipping.  Right.  Thanks, guys.  Fuck it out.  Thanks.  All right, man.  You punch yourself, my friend.  The Sixers signed a kid for two days.  Oh, Jesus.  Oldman Down Syndrome was already a star player.  For four years, Kevin was the manager of the Ben Salem High School basketball team.  With two minutes remaining in the final game of the season, Kevin's coach took him off the bench and put him in the game. 
[01:12:30]  He scored four three-pointers, knocking in this buzzer.  I don't see much defense.  I don't see anyone slamming him down.  It was only a matter of time before the pros came calling.  The Sixers signed Kevin to a ceremonial two-day contract with the team.  Congratulations.  You too.  I know you can shoot, but you can play defense too?  Yeah.  I say we give him a three-day contract.  Kevin hit the court for team practice, sporting his new custom jersey, scoring extra points with fans and family. 
[01:13:00]  Hey, the kid can sink free throws.  What he brings is just incredible.  What is he doing there?  That didn't make you smile.  Something's wrong with you this morning.  The vibe.  I don't fuck yourself.  That was slightly real, to be honest with you, because my first dream in life was to play in the NBA, and I worked my balls off. 
[01:13:30]  Well, if you'd have been a little smarter.  No kidding.  I'm pretty good.  I worked hard.  I was convinced I could make it into the NBA.  I didn't know you had a, you know.  Well, yeah.  You know.  How to, you know.  How to, uh, you know.  You missed this.  Ron Bennington was in here, and he's not a fan of that type of thing. 
[01:14:00]  He don't like that stuff?  He's not a fan of the, give the, the kid the football, the score, a touchdown.  Let him run as people are running next to him.  Ronnie's, uh, thought on that was basically, if you're going to put him in the game, you know.  Yeah.  You know.  Yes.  You know, fucking tackle him.  Uh, oh, that reminds me, uh, uh, what the hell was, somebody was telling me last night  about a, um, arena football.  Right.  Has this chick, and she's like, they gave her the ball at, like, the friggin' two-yard line 
[01:14:30]  or something.  Right.  And she just gets fucking lambasted.  Yeah.  What is that?  She's playing in the league, though?  Yeah, yeah.  She's actually playing.  You're, you're getting lazy.  But what, what's the matter?  You're getting lazy.  Why, what?  Seinfeld.  No, no, I swear.  I swear.  I swear.  No, that really happened.  That really happened.  Curb your enthusiasm?  No, no.  Arena football.  Wait, you just presented that horribly.  I know, because I was trying to think of.  Oh, my God.  Okay.  Oh, it was Nick.  No, I was trying to think of who told me.  It was Nick DiPaolo.  He said he had watched, um, a clip. 
[01:15:00]  Wait, what is he doing?  What is he doing?  No, I swear.  This is a real thing?  Yes.  No, it's cycle.  There's a girl.  Oh, cycle.  No, no.  Okay.  There's a girl that plays arena football, and she got lambasted.  But it's not an all-girl team.  She's playing on a team with guys.  So why is she on the team?  I don't know.  Is she good enough to be on the team?  Apparently not if she, like, gets fucking creamed every time she gets the ball.  That could just be her fucking line letting it happen because they don't like her on the team.  Maybe.  But they, apparently, from what Nick said... 
[01:15:30]  She's a running back.  Oh, okay.  I'm sending Sam the clip right now.  Apparently, from what Nick said, he, like, they give her no fucking sympathy for being a chick.  All right, why don't we...  Blindside her.  We'll take a break.  We'll find that clip.  We'll start with that clip after the break.  And also, we got Caitlin Farrington, who won a gold medal.  She's coming in today, hopefully, with the gold medal.  She won the gold in Women's Half Pipe.  And Ted Nugent's in Dutch.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, we'll talk about Ted Nugent next as well.  That was insane. 
[01:16:00]  He's an idiot.  You can think it, but don't do it.  There's no consequences for a guy like that, though.  Not for Ted.  We'll get into that discussion as well.  Hey, this is Dr. Steve from Weird Medicine with another Dr. Steve Mental Minute.  Hello, Dr. Steve.  This is Bob from Pennsylvania.  And I take sleeping pills.  Some friends of mine have told me that they're going to kill me.  And I want to know if this is bunk or if there's something to it.  If I need to stop taking these things, please let me know. 
[01:16:30]  Although there are studies showing that alcohol increases the risk of death  in people who are taking sleeping pills, so don't do that.  I think what you're referring to is a recent article in the online version  of the British Medical Journal that matched a group of people  who take sleeping pills on a regular basis with a group of people who don't.  And the conclusion they drew were pretty frightening.  The group that took even just a few sleeping pills a year had a four-fold increase in death. 
[01:17:00]  The groups that took more sleeping pills a year had an even higher death rate.  Now, the problem with this study is that no single cause of death was identified.  In addition, doing a placebo study that might answer this question  and the study might increase participants' death four-fold would probably be unethical.  If there's any good news in this, of the 35,000 people who were in the study,  there were only 638 deaths that were attributed to the sleeping pill group 
[01:17:30]  and approximately 240 in the group that weren't taking sleeping pills.  So the absolute risk of death still remains low.  Everyone who is taking sleeping pills on a regular basis should talk to their doctor  about whether there are other options for them.  Interestingly, the sleep aid melatonin and the prescription medication Rosarum  were not included in this study because they're not quote-unquote hypnotic agents,  and they might be a worthy replacement for insomniacs who get boned by this study. 
[01:18:00]  Be sure to check out Weird Medicine Saturdays at 10 p.m. Eastern  right here on the Opie and Anthony Channel.  Good.  The Opie and Anthony Show is back on SiriusXM.  Good at it.  Oi.  All right.  Oi, oi, oi, oi, oi, oi.  It's been dubbed ACDC Day.  Yes, it has. 
[01:18:30]  Mm-hmm.  Lost by Scott 34 years ago today.  Damn.  With that vomit thing.  Hypothermia, I think, was actually...  I heard Ozzie in an interview once say that he died of hypothermia,  so I don't know if it was the choking or if it was hypothermia.  He froze to death in a car.  What was he?  He was puking outside in the snow?  No, he fell asleep in a car outside.  Oh, Jesus.  Genesis.  No waste. 
[01:19:00]  We were talking about bands.  We forgot to mention Genesis did very well with changing their lead singer.  Oh, they certainly did.  Went from Peter Gabriel to Phil Collins.  Yes.  T and T.  And Sid Barrett in Pink Floyd.  Ooh.  Somebody mentioned that.  T.  Well, the band got way more famous after that.  Indeed.  Indeed.  The fucking guitar. 
[01:19:30]  ACDC guitar.  It was fucking great.  By the way, that teenage girl is not a serial killer.  Right?  No?  What, you think she's bullshit?  Fuck yeah.  She's crazy.  Love a good crazy bitch.  I think she was molested as a child or something, right?  Oh, my goodness.  That fucked up her brain.  I mean, there's no way she killed all those people.  She's no Dave Herman?  She's no Dave Herman.  No.  She admitted to killing 22 people.  I said she lost track at 22. 
[01:20:00]  She's fucking lying.  Liar, liar.  Pants on fire.  Exactly.  What's the matter, Sam?  Nothing.  Go behind me.  T.  And T.  I don't like you fucking camouflage army pants.  Are they camo?  Are you?  Oh, man.  Camo is, uh...  I can't see your legs.  Where are they?  All right, so where's this video Ant was talking about?  Yeah, where's that, uh, that chick being fucking blindsided?  Somebody wants to comment about the Dr. Steve clip. 
[01:20:30]  We do the Dr. Steve minute every once in a while.  Oh, good.  It's too long?  Let's say, uh, let's say hi to Walter, North Carolina.  Walter.  Hey, boys.  How are you today?  Pretty good.  Hello there, Walt.  Yeah.  Um, I don't know.  Y'all are probably away from the radio.  I don't know if you listened to the clip, but Dr. Steve said, uh, they had a caller, or  right, so they wrote in and said that he'd been taking sleeping pills, and his friends  said they were going to kill him, and he wanted to know about it.  So Dr. Steve went into a big, long spill about how the sleeping pills study said people  think sleeping pills may kill them. 
[01:21:00]  But that's not what the caller said.  He said, he's been taking sleeping pills, and his friends said they were going to kill  him should he stop taking the sleeping pills.  I think he misinterpreted.  Oh, well, Dr. Steve is a twit.  Do you get the point, though?  He needs to stop taking the sleeping pills because his friends said they were going to kill him.  We understand.  Yeah, the pills were going to kill him.  Oh, shit, calm down.  Reiterate again.  What did Dr. Steve do wrong?  It doesn't sound like he did anything wrong.  No, it was a joke.  He misinterpreted what the caller said. 
[01:21:30]  He's taking the sleeping pills, and his friends said they were going to kill him.  So it's like either the friends will kill you, or the sleeping pills will kill you.  Wait, I don't understand.  I don't understand.  I don't understand.  Rephrase it.  No, I'm not going to do it again.  Is it in the wording?  Yes.  Oh, how so?  All right, this is like, I didn't hear you.  Do you want me to say it again?  No, it's not.  I think you're being picky.  Yeah.  What are you trying to say?  Slow down. 
[01:22:00]  Listen to the, just listen to the.  No, I get the Dr. Steve part.  So what was said wrong there?  Yeah.  It wasn't said wrong.  It was interpreted wrong.  Well, what was interpreted wrong?  Yes.  Okay, he said, the caller said, I'm taking sleeping pills.  Right.  My friends said they are going to kill me should I stop taking the sleeping pills.  Right.  And what did Dr. Steve say?  He went into a spill about people that take sleeping pills die more often than people that don't. 
[01:22:30]  So he thought, he thought the guy said the sleeping pills will kill him.  But he said, but what really meant was that the friends will kill him.  That's what I interpreted.  Maybe you interpreted wrong.  Maybe I am.  Maybe I am.  So you really believe that this guy really thinks that his friends are going to kill him.  However.  And the sleeping pills have nothing to do with it.  However long this call has been going.  Yeah.  That's how long we have wasted time.  Good point. 
[01:23:00]  All right, sir.  Thank you.  Thanks for bringing that to our attention.  Oh my God.  Speaking of sleep.  Let's go to the Ukraine.  Z-ing everybody to sleep.  How do you say your name?  Yeah.  Hello.  Hello.  Sab.  Sab.  Ukraine.  Oh, hi.  Hello.  What's your name?  Oh, the girl taking the call.  She kind of didn't hear it correctly.  It's S-L-A-V. 
[01:23:30]  Slav.  Slav.  Slav.  My name is Slav.  I am Lev.  I am Lev.  You're calling from the Ukraine.  Yeah, I'm calling from Kiev.  And I want to say that I'm a big fan of your show.  And I want to say that Jimmy is hilarious.  We're going to Pancake's house.  We're going to Pancake's house.  We were just discussing this last night.  I'm sure you're so near about a beer.  How are you hearing us?  Actually, I'm not hearing you right now. 
[01:24:00]  I'm going to hear you tomorrow.  I just rang them.  We decided to call an issue.  How do you hear us?  Because we were discussing that we've got fans all over the world now, which is crazy to us.  But because the satellite only goes, you know.  Yeah, so far.  So far.  Well, the first time I heard about Opie and Anthony's show, just some guy posted a video on YouTube.  YouTube.  So he posts every episode of your show the day after. 
[01:24:30]  Are you protesting?  We're watching Kiev burn right now on the news.  Yeah, man.  How bad is it over there?  It's horrible.  It's a total disaster.  And, well, I'm not at work.  I mean, I work in a little cubicle downtown.  And a few miles away, I just see smoke coming out.  And it's on fire.  See, but that's how the news is.  It's like watching the news, you'd think all of Kiev is fucking burning, crazy.  And this guy's like, yeah, I see some smoke from my cubicle. 
[01:25:00]  He's still going to work.  Yeah, it's just downtown.  The whole, like, field of fight is just within a few miles.  And anyways, I didn't come to work today.  I just decided to stay at home.  Because they closed the underground, the tube.  Oh, the tube.  The tube.  They closed the tube.  What was the first O.B. and Anthony video that you heard?  Where you decided, oh, fuck, I'm going to listen to these guys. 
[01:25:30]  Well, long story short, I saw a video of Bill Burr on your show.  And I found it hilarious.  It was some kind of a mix of the best of Bill Burr or something.  All right, but that got you hooked.  Awesome.  Good.  Yeah, yeah.  Very good.  I'm listening to his podcast every Monday.  We were thinking that maybe SiriusXM should take advantage of the fact that there are fans outside the United States. 
[01:26:00]  That they maybe should try to figure out a business model for that.  Yeah, it's all over the world.  Right, all over the world.  Even in Ukraine.  How many, anybody else listening to the show in the Ukraine?  No.  That's it.  One guy.  So we think we got the Ukraine covered.  Yeah, exactly.  We're going to do a live event.  One guy with a fucking Molotov cocktail.  Look at us feeling good about ourselves.  It turns out it's one guy in the Ukraine.  Hey, how's that Chernobyl radiation doing? 
[01:26:30]  It's a bad joke.  It's a bad joke?  What?  You didn't go this way.  No, I mean, do you still have people getting fucked up from the radiation?  No.  No?  It's fine?  No.  Yeah, I think it's all right.  Everything's been fixed.  Everybody go back home.  No problems.  Right.  I would imagine.  There's still some radiation over there, and it's like within 20 or 30 kilometers from 
[01:27:00]  Kiev.  Oh, we're American.  We don't know what those kilometers are.  Sure.  I don't know.  Miles, baby.  Pounds.  Absolutely.  I'd rather wound-a-meter.  What is it, like a .62 or something?  We're killing you.  All right, we're done with you, Ukraine.  The Ukraine is weak.  I feel like we should give him more time, because he's called for the use of the same. 
[01:27:30]  I know, the Ukraine is so far away, but...  But fuck.  Pretty much ran its course.  This guy was from Ohio.  We would have hung up on him already.  Yes.  Anything else, Ukraine?  No, you can just sign up on me.  I just wanted to say hi and send it to Ross, and that's basically it.  All right.  Well, thank you, Slav.  I just wanted to call her and to say this and that and that's it.  All right.  You can just sign up on me.  Okay, Slav.  All right, Slav.  Thank you, sir.  All right.  Let's go to Ohio now. 
[01:28:00]  Dave in Ohio has something very unique for the show.  Go ahead, Dave.  What's going on, boys?  Hey, buddy.  Hey, man.  Hey, I found a rebuttal song to that Nicki Minaj song you played, Looking At Nigga.  Yeah.  I want to get myself pumped up this morning, so I go to play that.  And I find a song called Looking At Bitches by one Mr. Cassidy on YouTube.  Hmm.  So we should be playing this for everybody.  These never work, do they? 
[01:28:30]  No.  Listener requests.  When I get a link for it, it's like, you've got to check this out.  Right.  I swear I last probably three fucking seconds into the song.  Why?  Is it usually good?  It's usually shit.  You're about on with that, Andy.  Oh.  Oh.  Wow.  Rebuttal songs are never good.  Oh, boy.  Let's see the rebuttal song.  We can't even find the thing.  Sweet Home Alabama was a good rebuttal song.  Meow, meow, meow.  That was a rebuttal song. 
[01:29:00]  Yeah, it's a million.  Mm-hmm.  Here's Cassidy looking at...  Looking at ass bitches.  Yeah, looking at ass bitches.  Cassidy.  Look at y'all pathetic ass bitches, but the child support keep getting pregnant ass bitches. 
[01:29:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Bitches.  Yeah.  Bitches.  Look at y'all looking at ass bitches.  Bitches.  Holy fuck.  These looking ass bitches.  Man, I ain't even looking at bitches.  Rocking a fake mainstream pussy ass bitches.  Hey, Dave.  Why do you waste our time?  Is that you?  Is that you rapping, sir?  Dave.  Is that you? 
[01:30:00]  Uh, guilty.  It's you?  Sounds pretty good, though, right?  I'll tell you the problem.  If the rap part wasn't bad, it's a little, uh, a little bit slower.  I would say you should take out a teeny bit of the production, like, looking at ass bitches.  It's not that bad.  And it's doing really well.  It's Cassidy, though.  But...  Bitches.  Wait, so it's not you rapping?  Unless this is Cassidy.  Are you Cassidy?  For a Wednesday morning, you know...  What the fuck is it?  Is it you rapping? 
[01:30:30]  Oh, it's Cassidy.  You just said guilty.  Is it you or not?  No, I called in and said it's Cassidy.  I'm just, uh...  But didn't we ask him if it was him and he said guilty?  I heard that, yes.  What are you doing?  All right, for a Wednesday morning, just, uh, hanging with...  Oh, so you don't know who you are?  He doesn't know who he is.  You don't know if you're Cassidy or Dave from Cleveland?  What is going on today?  Cassidy is, like, a famous rapper.  Oh, is he?  Okay.  I say copyright.  But we asked him if he was the dude and he said guilty.  That means he's the dude.  Correct. 
[01:31:00]  But I would say he's not the dude.  Cartwright.  He announced himself as Cassidy.  All you're making me want to do is hear the fucking Nicki Minaj song.  Yeah.  Right.  All right.  Well, that was terrific, Dave.  Thank you.  Oh, yeah.  Enjoy.  Okay.  Enjoy.  Enjoy what?  Did everyone go out to a fucking comedy show last night?  I think so.  Stay up a little late?  We got a gold medalist.  We got a gold medalist going to be here in a few minutes, so.  Is she in the building?  Yes.  Is she doing other shows besides ours? 
[01:31:30]  Not.  Well, I don't know.  So what?  Let's bring her in, I guess.  She's cute.  She's cute.  I saw a picture.  Yo, what's up?  Is she coming down the hall now?  Is Roland bringing her in?  I don't know.  Rolando?  I don't know.  Was Roland?  Yeah, Roland was there last night.  Yes, he was.  I didn't see a lot of people last night.  I sequestered myself.  Yeah, I didn't see anyone, but you guys and the acts.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Came in late and left her. 
[01:32:00]  Yes.  I don't know how to do that.  So you trained for the Olympics.  Did you enjoy it?  So at what age did you?  Did you ever fall?  Did you ever fall?  Did you ever fall in the snow?  We're only doing this because we've never seen a gold medal before.  I want to see that gold medal.  We've seen a gold medal before, right?  Yeah, Sean White.  Yeah, Sean White.  Sean White brought in his medals?  I don't know.  Right?  I don't know if he did.  I remember holding an Olympic gold medal.  I feel like he didn't, and there's a reason why or something. 
[01:32:30]  Oh, maybe.  Travis, do you remember?  Yes, he brought them in.  He brought them in.  Well, Travis is saying, go fuck yourself.  Shit.  I don't remember that.  So many words.  So then we don't need to talk to her.  We've already seen a gold medal before.  I kind of want to see the new gold medal.  Right.  The social gold medal.  Well, why don't you just bite into a chicken McNugget?  It's the same thing.  Same thing.  Oh, I'm loving it.  Look at Mars walking around with a cane. 
[01:33:00]  Oh, Mars has a cane.  Look.  Why doesn't he get a hurry cane?  He looks like an old feet.  An OG.  Yeah, he does.  He's slow, that piece of garbage.  He's like a pimp, yo.  He's walking with a little cane because he's got his patella tendon taken out or some shit.  Wow.  There she is.  Bring her right in, Sam.  All right.  There we go.  Hello.  How you doing?  Welcome to the O.B. and Anthony show, Caitlin.  Take a seat.  Caitlin Farrington. 
[01:33:30]  One gold in a women's half pipe.  How cool is that?  That's pretty goddamn cool.  It's been pretty awesome.  I bet.  Where are you from?  Sun Valley, Idaho, originally.  Right on.  See, so you've been like snowboarding, skiing, everything.  Yeah, I ski.  Snow.  I started skiing when I was three and then swapped over to snowboarding, and so I've been...  Three?  Yeah.  Were people like snobby?  Like, like, ew, she's going to snowboard.  No, my parents were maybe a little bummed at the time because they were big into skiing. 
[01:34:00]  Skiers don't look...  They look down at snowboarders, right?  Sometimes.  Yeah.  Not as much nowadays.  Not, yeah.  But at first it was you either did one or the other, man.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  Now, my neighbors in...  I live in Salt Lake City now, and my neighbors, when I moved in the house next door, they're  like, don't talk to my kids because they ski at Alta, and that's in a resort that doesn't  allow snowboarders.  They don't allow snowboarders?  Yeah.  One of... 
[01:34:30]  Wow.  I think there's three in the U.S.  They'll let them do.  We shan't have snowboarders.  Why do they like you guys?  I don't know.  I think because we're different.  There's an image that snowboarders present, like they're smoking weed all the time.  Smoking weed.  Party image.  Yeah.  A lot of party.  A lot of long wool caps and wacky attire.  They like well-dressed people on the slopes.  But they ban snowboarders?  That's kind of silly.  You don't want to hang out with those people anyway, then. 
[01:35:00]  That is.  That's silly.  And then how did you start competing?  Like, you just figured, hey, I think I'm really good at this.  Um, one of my good friends, Heather Black from Sun Valley, she kind of like was on the Sun  Valley snowboard team.  And I would go snowboarding with her every day when she was done with team.  And she convinced me one day to just, she's like, you should join team with me.  Like, let's go to Wendell's one summer.  And so I went to Wendell's and then started competing with her, just kind of started the 
[01:35:30]  tour of snowboarding.  And it was pretty funny because like everybody used to joke with me.  They're like, Caitlin, you just do this for the dudes.  And I'm like, yeah.  Because I was in high school.  And so I was like, yeah, pretty much.  I just like do this for the dudes.  You were the chick that was like doing what the guys were doing on snowboards.  Yeah.  Trying.  Trying.  And then fast forward, you win the gold medal.  That's crazy.  Yeah.  It's been awesome.  Do you get bored with regular guys?  Um, no.  No?  But wouldn't you like, if you were dating snowboarders, it's probably hard to date someone that's just 
[01:36:00]  got like a regular nine to five job.  Yeah, I guess we probably don't have that much in common.  I don't know.  It's whatever.  Yeah.  What else do you do besides snowboard for fun?  Um, I play golf.  Wow.  Actually, through the summers, I've picked up golf.  And so I've been playing golf.  I don't know.  Just kind of whatever comes to mind.  What a great life.  I know, right?  Do you have to make money?  Um, I make it snowboarding, so.  That's great. 
[01:36:30]  There's enough money to be made, huh?  Yeah.  Endorsements and stuff now?  Yeah, sponsors.  Yeah.  It's kind of all of that, so.  That's pretty fun.  That is awesome.  Yeah, my roommates in Salt Lake, or my old roommates in Salt Lake, they were just like,  man, Caitlin, you just make our life seem like it sucks.  Because they're like going to school every day and kind of doing that.  And then I just got to sit on the couch and be like, what should I do today?  How is living in Salt Lake?  Like, it's just two, like, camps in Salt Lake, right? 
[01:37:00]  Isn't there like the strict Mormons and then there's kind of like the party people?  Yeah, I mean, not so, I don't think, like, the Mormons are, they're in Salt Lake, but  not as many.  They're more north, like, in Provo or south, or wait, that's backwards, south and Provo and  north and Ogden.  So, I don't know, you don't really get that many, but.  Yeah.  And then with, like, the University of Utah that's there, it's just all college kids.  Yeah, from all over.  And mostly all of them are, like, moved to Utah just to ski and snowboard, so. 
[01:37:30]  We got the answer to the question.  The skiers want in badly.  This is so stupid.  David in Houston, go ahead.  Yeah, how's it going, guys?  Hey, buddy.  We got Caitlin Farrington in studio.  She won gold.  Congratulations on your gold.  Thanks.  I was just going to call and say, you know, skiers don't really care for snowboarders  because the snowboarders, they tend to go a lot slower, and they also just sit down in  the middle of the fucking mountain. 
[01:38:00]  And somewhere around the corner, there's just a snowboarder sitting on the mountain.  It's kind of true.  Do you just sit down?  I mean, sometimes we sit down, but not, like, in the middle of the mountain.  I feel like the skiers go from one side of the trail to the next side.  Oh, right.  They make these, like, big turps.  Sweeping S-turns and stuff.  Well, when you're going that much faster, you've got to make a turn.  You can't control that.  Yeah, but you go all the way across each run.  At least stay out of everyone's way.  Yeah, come on. 
[01:38:30]  At least they're not snow plowing down the mountain.  Just pizza.  No way to make pizza slices when you're snowboarding.  All right, let me say hi to Alan in Florida.  Alan.  Yeah, I know.  I live in Florida now, but I've been skier for many, many, many years.  I was up north, and I've done both.  I switched over to snowboarding.  I switched back to skiing.  I do both.  But anyway, whenever I'm skiing, I do feel like the snowboarders are in the way.  And whenever I'm skiing, when I'm snowboarding, I feel like the skiers are in the way. 
[01:39:00]  And it's just like this young lady said.  The skiers will basically go across the whole trail to get down.  And the snowboarders kind of just kind of barreled down on a nice line.  So it's just we do get in each other's way.  There's no doubt about it.  Wait, you guys don't go down separately?  Like, you'll just both just everyone just goes down when they go down?  Yeah.  What do you think?  I think there was some kind of an order to it.  No!  So you'll go down and a guy will just ski around you and keep going?  Yeah, whatever.  Oh, wow.  I love Jimmy's thought.  It's like everyone's got to stay on line. 
[01:39:30]  You're like Nazi skiing.  Yeah, exactly.  A straight line.  We must have a wonder.  Oh, no.  I didn't realize it was just a giant clusterfucked island snowboarding and crossing.  There's access happening all the time.  People are just slamming it with each other because they don't know what the fuck you're doing.  Have you had access there with other people?  No, not I haven't, but I've had friends.  I've seen them go down, too.  Yeah.  It's not good.  Brutal.  It's not very pretty.  You just see skis flying everywhere.  What do they call that? 
[01:40:00]  Yard sale.  Yard sale, of course.  Oh, yard sale.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's a good one.  We got, I think, one of your friends calling in.  Oh, good.  Do you know what Jeremy?  Jeremy Black?  Jeremy in Park City.  What's up?  Oh, I don't know.  Caitlin, it's Cooper.  Oh, what's up?  Oh.  Come on.  Congratulations.  Thank you.  Who's Cooper?  So awesome.  I watched you just chillin' on TV.  Oh, thanks, Jeremy.  Yeah.  He works at the Park City Mountain Resort.  Oh. 
[01:40:30]  Yep.  Yeah.  They must all be pretty psyched.  Oh, yeah.  Just friggin' going crazy now.  What do you got for Caitlin, Jeremy?  That's it?  I want a congratulator.  I've watched her train a lot at Park City, and I just wanted to congratulate her and give her  a high-five.  I'm a good over the air.  Yeah.  Thanks, Jeremy.  I'll see you when I get back to Park City.  Damn.  Awesome.  Do you have to go back to Russia?  No.  You know?  No.  You're not going to go back for the closing ceremonies?  No.  It was just kind of too much traveling, and I got stuff here, and I'd like to go home 
[01:41:00]  to Sun Valley, because Sun Valley helped my parents get to Russia so they could come  watch and just have supported me through the years.  So I'm just going to go back there and hang out.  They're throwing me a big street party, so it'll be pretty fun.  Wait.  With the closing ceremony, you're going to miss that just kind of going up there and getting  the medal.  Do you have the medal yet?  Yeah, I do.  Do you have it on you?  I do.  It's in my back.  And we got to see the gold medal.  Hell yeah.  A real gold medal. 
[01:41:30]  That's pretty goddamn cool.  Oh, there it is.  Wow.  Yeah.  Not everybody can say they got one of those.  Wow.  That's heavier than I would have thought.  Yeah.  Everyone says that, I bet.  Oh, it's heavy.  Yeah.  You've got to put it over your head.  Oh, there you go.  That is cool, man.  Here you go.  You can put that away.  Thanks.  Hey.  Oh, I want to see it a lot.  I want to see it.  That is pretty cool. 
[01:42:00]  Wowee.  Oh, gold medal.  Yeah, so I already got the medal, so I don't need to go back.  How much could you sell that thing for?  I don't know.  That was my joke.  People were like, Caitlin, what are you going to do with that?  I was like, I might just auction it off on eBay.  I'm like, really?  Well, I don't know.  The ribbon looks like it's wrinkled, and we'll have to put it in a frame.  I'll give you $20 for a pawn shop, assholes.  Yeah.  Well, that is heavy, but that's cool, though. 
[01:42:30]  Yeah.  It's almost, it has an image.  It's like, what's that cutout?  It's obviously a circle, but there's a cutout in it.  I think it's like a mountain range-ish kind of.  Yeah, that's a mountain or something, right?  Yeah.  I got to take it.  I got to Instagram this, so I look like a fucking star today, man.  Have you just walked around the house wearing that?  No, but it's been in my pocket for the past couple of days, because people are always like, oh, where's your medal?  And actually, Kelly Clark, she's like, Caitlin, the best thing to do is just keep it on you for the next month or two. 
[01:43:00]  Yeah, because everybody's going to be asking.  Yeah, everyone's going to want to see it.  I would put it on, though.  If you go into a store or something, I'd just be like, hey, how you doing?  And they'd be like, oh, is that a...  Oh, yeah, it is.  Oh, yes, it is.  Yeah, I just won this.  Actually, I did that to the hockey boys in Russia.  Yeah?  I was like...  Oh, the hockey boys.  What's that about?  I walked up and introduced myself, and they all were kind of just looking at me like I was crazy.  I was like, yes, this is a gold medal around my neck, so...  Burn.  Very nice.  That was pretty good.  That's so cool, man.  You should get the gold medal discount. 
[01:43:30]  You should walk around and just go to the stores, right?  That's it.  People should just give you free stuff all the time now.  Yeah.  I like your guys' thoughts on that.  Yeah.  What were you thinking when you won the gold medal?  That's pretty good.  I was thinking, this is fucking awesome.  Right.  Nice.  I was like, I can't believe I'm up here because, I don't know, I wasn't expecting it at all,  and I think a lot of people weren't expecting me to win, so it was just a good experience all around.  How was the actual village where everybody is staying?  Oh, I mean...  We've heard rumors, Caitlin.  I know, but I wasn't staying in the village, actually. 
[01:44:00]  Why?  Oh, are you too good for the village, were you?  All those bronze and silver medal pigs.  I don't hang out with the curlers.  They didn't have enough room for us when we got up there.  Not enough pot in the village.  But then they also, it was a dry village, so you couldn't get alcohol or anything in.  I know that people were, like, putting it in water bottles, trying to sneak it in.  Oh, really?  So, but, yeah, I don't know.  I can't imagine you're partying before your event. 
[01:44:30]  No.  I hear a lot of people do, because they got the downtime, so they're like, screw it, we'll  party a little bit.  Yeah, sometimes, I mean, we were waiting around for a while, for a couple days, we were there  before, like, we even could start practice.  So, sometimes there's just not that much to do.  Yeah, a little bored.  Yeah, you're like, oh, card games and a couple beers?  Yeah, sounds great.  Do they tell you don't leave, like, do they advise you not to leave that area, like it's  dangerous?  Um, they were telling us not to, like, wear our USA stuff around, but it was fine. 
[01:45:00]  It was, like...  Yeah, they were making a big stink about it.  Yeah.  Here, but...  And then, like, once we were there, it was really mellow.  There was, like, there's a ton of...  I think they said there was, like, 25 security people for one athlete, so...  Wow.  It was around, and, like, everybody knew where we were at at certain times, even though we  didn't know about it.  Did you see Bob Costas' eyeballs?  Oh, I did not, but I heard.  Yeah, it's pretty wicked. 
[01:45:30]  He's looking pretty bad.  Oh, man.  Worst pink eye ever.  Yeah.  So what do you miss by not going back?  Where they kind of stand there on...  Do they still do that?  Where they'll stand on the gold, the silver, and the bronze?  Oh, you already did that.  I already did that.  Oh, you did?  Okay.  It's just the closing ceremony, which is one big, you know, little party.  Yeah, it's kind of a closing ceremony, and then I did...  And the athletes all wear their medals as they walk back in?  Oh.  Oh, and then I did miss going to all the events I signed up for, and that's about it, because 
[01:46:00]  I didn't really get to see that many events while I was there, but I had signed up for,  like, everything.  Wait, you get to just sign up for whatever event you want to go to?  Wow, that's cool.  Yeah.  What were you looking forward to seeing?  Oh, I was looking forward to seeing hockey.  I wanted to go to some figure skating.  I had curling on my list.  Curling?  Come on, do you like curling, or you just don't want to be rude to the curling?  No, I just wanted to go check it out.  I mean, it's legal for them to drink a beer while they're curling or something.  Oh, really?  Oh, really?  That's hilarious. 
[01:46:30]  We just got to go check this out, at least.  That's like bowling, you know?  Yeah.  You could just have a drink, you bowl.  Yeah.  Damn.  So, signed up for mostly every event I could.  Some speed skating, but didn't get to check out anything.  I like that snowboard cross.  I think that's my favorite event.  Oh, yeah.  That's sick.  Have you ever done that?  No.  I'm too afraid.  I would just, like, once the gate went down, I'd sit in the back, let everybody else go,  and then me trail behind them.  Sit down in the middle of the course, like snowboarders.  Right.  What is snowboard? 
[01:47:00]  What is that?  It's like motocross, basically.  Same kind of concept, but these guys are almost pushing each other out of the way to get down  the hill.  It's crazy.  Yeah.  There's six of them that start at the same time and race down the hill through.  Jumps and turns.  Yeah.  That's pretty nutty.  It's wild.  Let me say hi to John in Queens.  We're talking to Caitlin Farrington here today.  John.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Bill Burkilled last night.  Great show.  Absolutely.  Caitlin, you did the U.S. proud.  Really, really proud of you. 
[01:47:30]  Doing a great job winning the gold, bringing it back to the studio.  I also wanted to thank you for being smoking hot and making Opie and Anthony sound like  stupid little boys.  He's not lying.  He's on to us.  He's on to us.  Yeah, we do that.  Yeah, we get all shines.  Yeah, they're not used to being a soft word.  Oh, they're bright red bloodshed.  We get just pigs in here usually.  Yeah, not many athletes. 
[01:48:00]  No.  They're way through here.  So you're doing David Letterman tomorrow?  Wow.  No, actually, it got moved up to today.  Awesome.  This afternoon.  Because it got you doing something wacky?  I don't know.  We'll see.  Like they'll build a half pipe outside?  We'll probably build something outside for you, right?  Yeah.  What do you do after this?  Like what do you want?  You're a professional snowboarder, but do you teach people it or where do you go with  it?  Well, actually, I still got one more contest this year that I'm going to do in Vail, Colorado, 
[01:48:30]  the U.S. Open.  And so going to do that, and then the season's done, and then it's just hopefully like some  free ridings and hopefully some powder and, yeah, enjoying it.  Put some endorsements.  Walk around, go meet people.  Play some golf.  Play some golf.  That's a life of leisure, isn't it?  Right, right?  Isn't that cool?  You are living a life of leisure.  I can do whatever I want.  Work on your chipping.  Yeah.  That rules.  Work on your potting.  God damn. 
[01:49:00]  You got yourself one of those boyfriends?  No.  Why is that?  Is it your career too important or guys are assholes?  Guys are assholes.  They're all scumbags.  I've learned that this year that guys are scumbags.  Did you get fucked over?  Yeah.  Yeah, maybe a little bit, but it was for the best, so.  No shit.  Oh, there's a guy out there somewhere regretting it.  You're holding up your gold medal everywhere.  Yep.  You don't screw up the relationship before the Olympics. 
[01:49:30]  Yeah, what is he, an idiot?  Yeah.  Yeah, maybe she came home with a bronze then.  Yeah, or no medal at all.  Yeah, but it's a bronze.  I don't think a lot of athletes like the bronze medal.  I got to be honest with you.  They look a little fucking mad when they grab that bronze.  Yeah, that's a just missed.  Right?  Well, I mean, I think the fourth place is probably the hardest one.  Sure.  Yeah, sure.  Nothing.  Because you're like, oh, I was so close to being on that podium.  Something.  Coming home with a medal, yeah.  Yeah.  How much did you win by?  How much time? 
[01:50:00]  Only 0.25.  So, it was really close.  Wait, 0.25 is less than a second?  Oh, well, we're judged.  Yeah, they're judged on their tricks and stuff.  Oh, okay.  Their moves.  So, yeah, I only won by a little amount, and I'm glad I did.  Did you feel like one of the judges was not giving you what you deserved?  No.  No?  I didn't even think I was going to win.  So, I was like, when I found out that I was going to be an Olympic medalist at first,  and I was like, oh, my gosh, I'm on this podium. 
[01:50:30]  And then, after the next two girls came down, I was like, oh, my gosh, I'm actually, I'm on top of this podium.  So, you had two more people that had to go down.  Well, I actually, I had, I dropped for finals, I dropped fifth, and there's 12.  So, I got to watch, actually, I don't know, my math.  Seven?  Yeah, but maybe I dropped sixth.  And so, then, I got to watch six people, and three of them were other Olympic gold medalists from the previous Olympics. 
[01:51:00]  Okay.  And I got to watch every single one of them come down that half by thin.  But it was fine.  You're just going to fall.  You're just like, fall.  No.  Yes.  But, you know, I was just like, man, this is just going to be, this is tough.  But I had a good run, so I knew that they had to do something spectacular to beat me.  Yeah.  They find mistakes in things that I would never see as mistakes.  Like, it's amazing, like, what they look for in these type of events, because they're like, oh, but apparently the left leg should have been further back. 
[01:51:30]  What?  What an asshole these judges are.  They were all the spins and the twists.  It's amazing what you guys did.  It really is amazing.  We got Snowy in Michigan that wants in on this.  Snowy.  Hey, how y'all doing?  All right.  Hey, it's nice that Opie's resisting the urge of calling her a broad.  I've been on a broad kick lately.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's right.  Yeah, that's right.  We will not be calling Caitlyn a broad.  It's like, yeah, people go to the Olympics, they've trained their whole lives and everything like that, and then Opie's like, yeah, I was watching this broad the other night. 
[01:52:00]  It was broad.  I don't know.  It's film noir Opie.  All right, Snowy, relax.  We're getting along here.  This is nice.  No rat outs.  Now you're getting thrown under the bus.  Oh, boy.  This show tends to do that.  Yeah.  Do you want to collect fridge magnets?  Yeah, I do.  I know.  I just saw that, too, and I don't like her as much now.  I'm kidding.  I'm kidding.  Why fridge magnets?  I don't know.  Well, I started out trying to collect snow globes, and you know how hard it is to get a snow globe on an airplane and not have it break all over your stuff? 
[01:52:30]  Yeah.  It's difficult.  Yeah.  It's happened many times to me, so I have a shelf of broken snow globes, and I'm like...  Those are like weapons at that point.  That sounds like the title of your book, like if things go really bad, a shelf of broken snow globes.  Yeah, so I started with fridge magnets because it was easy, and you find them in the airport when...  What's your favorite fridge magnet?  Um, I have this lamb one from New Zealand that's pretty funny. 
[01:53:00]  Oh, why?  Well, it's just goofy.  Is somebody doing something to it?  No.  Is there something behind the lamb?  I think, you know.  Is there a cliff involved?  You're flying out of the gutter.  Are you good at taking the magnet and flipping it onto the fridge so it sticks?  No, I haven't tried that.  You got like a magnet.  Oh, you don't keep them on the fridge?  Yeah.  Well, yeah, I do.  Probably got a nice sub-zero fridge.  It's stainless steel.  They don't stick to that shit.  No.  No.  I've got a fridge.  My fridge is full of magnets, you know. 
[01:53:30]  All right.  And you surf in New Zealand, right?  No, I've never have.  I've tried, but...  Oh, well, let me read this point.  Uh-oh, somebody.  She goes to New Zealand to surf.  No.  Wikipedia.  I go to snowboard.  You snowboard in New Zealand.  Yeah, and then I go to...  Usually I'll try and go to Australia and go surfing you over there.  So you know how to surf as well.  Yeah, but I call it drowning because I'm not very good.  No?  Scary.  You would think it's a pessimistic attitude.  But you would think a snowboarder would, you know, pick up surfing pretty easily. 
[01:54:00]  It's really hard.  It's that much different, huh?  Yeah.  It's not the same stuff.  It's just warmer.  Yeah, really.  But, yeah, it's a lot harder.  So I call it drowning because that's usually I'm just gasping for air.  And you know nothing's going to come up from the snow and eat you.  It's like...  The water's scary.  You try not to think about that.  Oh, man.  When I'm in the ocean, I cannot think of anything else.  There's a lot of real estate under me and there's literal monsters down there. 
[01:54:30]  Fuck that.  Keep me inside the boat.  Nice cocktail.  There's avalanches, though, in snow, so you've got to worry about that in snow.  Yeah, but no.  Not that bummed you out.  Yeah.  Let me...  Yeah.  You're a world traveler, so we're getting some good questions.  Josh in New Hampshire.  Go ahead.  Hey, Caitlin.  Congratulations.  My daughters and I watched you, and you're a great role model for them.  I really appreciate it.  Oh, thank you.  I just wanted to ask, when you're kicking around the Olympic Village, are there any athletes 
[01:55:00]  from a certain country that are just dicks?  Like the Ukraine girls, are they just awful?  No, I don't think so.  I think everyone's pretty nice.  Like, I don't know.  Yeah, you didn't need any real jackass in there.  No, I didn't.  And because I had the gold medal, they were all like my best friends.  They're going to be nice, too.  Yeah, yeah.  They would like...  But, yeah.  You're awesome.  Go USA.  Oh, thank you.  All right.  Did you really try to fund your early snowboarding trips selling family cows?  Yeah, we did, actually. 
[01:55:30]  I grew up in Idaho on a ranch, and that was kind of how I funded snowboarding, was selling  cows.  How much did you get for a cow?  Like a grand plus.  Righteous bucks.  You don't get attached to them?  No, I didn't name any of them.  And they were all like...  Why don't you name them?  Yeah.  They were all beef cows, too.  So, it was either sell them or take them to the slaughterhouse at one point in my life.  People think they're like...  Everybody gets this impression like they're the cows that you see in the 4-H competitions,  all clean and everything. 
[01:56:00]  Cows are disgusting.  That green shit on their ass all over the place.  They're licking their nose.  They stick their tongues up their nostrils.  Disgusting.  Thank God they're delicious.  Yeah.  You're not a vegetarian or anything, right?  No.  I don't think you're allowed to be from...  Where?  Iowa?  Idaho.  Idaho.  Same thing.  No, I'm kidding.  Of course.  Come on.  No, yeah, yeah.  That's like the heartland.  Yeah.  Will you make a lot more money now that you have a gold medal? 
[01:56:30]  I hope so.  I hope so.  I bet.  I bet you will.  Yeah, I might do pretty good for myself.  Just endorsing, like, a snowboard equipment.  What else can you endorse as a...  McDonald's.  Oh, that's right.  McDonald's.  Restaurants.  Yeah, restaurants.  I don't know.  I don't know.  My agent does that for me.  Yeah, yeah.  Gosh, she's got the greatest life ever.  Has anyone been shitty since you came back, just a clerk in a store or whatever, and you 
[01:57:00]  just want to hold it up in their face?  No.  That will happen to you.  That will happen to you.  That will happen to you.  Yeah, somebody will not know who you are, and they'll be kind of stupid, and you're going  to want to hold that medal up and smash them in the teeth.  And I suggest you do it.  Just swing that thing around.  I wonder how long you hold the gold medal around before you finally go, all right,  I've got to put this away.  I've got to just put this away.  How long do you think?  I don't know.  Kelly said, like, keep it around for a month because everyone's going to want to see it.  Yeah, and then after that, you could, like, put it away.  Any plans for four more years? 
[01:57:30]  I think I might try and go another round.  I mean, I've got nothing else to do right now, so I'm just going to keep snowboarding  and maybe just go another round.  It's really hard to believe she won a gold medal.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's the part of how she talks.  That's great.  That's the ultimate compliment, I guess.  Oh, my God.  Most of the interviews are golfing.  Most of the interviews are important.  And your fridge magnet collection rules. 
[01:58:00]  Caitlin's on Twitter, too, by the way.  It's K-A-I-T-L-Y-N-F-A-R-R.  Right.  Caitlin Farr on Twitter.  Do you tweet a lot?  No, it's kind of Instagram.  Oh, okay.  Do you Instagram a lot, then?  I Instagram, and then it goes to my Twitter feed.  Pictures of, like, Sochi.  Pictures of Sochi.  Pictures of...  You got a cat?  I do have a cat.  There you go.  Pictures of your cat.  No.  He doesn't...  My cat is an asshole.  His name is K-A-I-T-L-Y. 
[01:58:30]  And he hates everybody, even me sometimes.  And so...  Does he attack you?  Yeah.  He's, like...  He'll walk around the house and stalk your feet and then, like, get at you.  I know.  Cats are dicks.  They really are.  Every once in a while, you'll find a cool one, but...  Yeah.  I don't know.  My neighbors call him Cat Killer.  So...  Cat Killer.  He's just...  Did you not, like...  Were you not firm with him when he was young?  Because Anthony's cat is a savage, but because he let it do whatever it wanted.  I spoil him, and I don't care, because I think it's hilarious. 
[01:59:00]  I bet people go, oh, yeah, when he's doing something bad and you're supposed to reprimand  him, I grab the camera.  I'm like, this is hilarious.  Look, he's chilling this apart.  We got a very good question coming in before we let her go.  Dave in Ohio.  Go ahead.  Hi, Caitlin.  I wanted to ask, how important is the board?  It's really...  It's important.  Yeah.  How important is the board of snowboarding?  That's a very good question.  What a great question.  It's pretty important, I guess, because, I mean...  That's what you take down the mountain. 
[01:59:30]  Otherwise, you're just a person falling down a hill.  Yeah.  You grab your...  She answers it.  Oh, I will.  It's a Larry King question that was actually asked of a skateboarder.  How important is the board in skateboarding?  So, that's where that came from.  I would say pretty important.  Pretty important.  Yeah.  Almost the most important thing.  Oh, that's your Instagram right there?  Oh, look at that.  It must be so cool.  It's like, yeah, I got, you know, Olympics pictures up here.  That's what I do.  Is your Instagram the same as your Twitter? 
[02:00:00]  Yep.  Okay.  Good.  Cool.  We'll tweet and Instagram you.  Look at you biting the metal.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Do other people try to...  You've got to do it.  Do other people try to bite your metal and you're like, ugh.  No.  Get my metal out of your mouth.  Exactly.  Knock it off.  Right.  You can see it, but relax.  That's pretty cool.  For real.  That's really cool.  What a blast, man.  Yeah.  You're definitely a pisser.  It's been pretty fun.  I bet.  And Caitlin's on Letterman tonight, too. 
[02:00:30]  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Let's make sure we watch.  Do you know who else you're on with?  I don't.  Oh, you've been checking.  No.  I haven't checked.  She don't care.  I don't know.  All I know is I'm on there.  That's right.  That's all that matters, right?  Yeah.  Somebody wants to know who is the blonde girl you're kissing on a Google image.  Huh?  What?  I don't know.  Let's go to Google image real fast.  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  Do you search your name?  I have before you, definitely. 
[02:01:00]  And you find just some of the most awful photos of yourself sometimes.  And you're like, man, why'd they choose this one?  No, your Google image is all right.  You got some good ones.  Oh, yeah, you're okay.  You're all right.  Now they're good.  Oh, right.  Yeah, yeah, because that's true.  Yeah, because all these pictures go right to the top.  A lot of girls, when you search their name, before you finish, it says, like, the name  and then feet.  Like, people want to see where are her feet. 
[02:01:30]  Yeah, Heather Mills' feet.  That's a great Google image.  Is that the photo?  I mean, that's my mom.  Oh, God.  Adam, it's her mom.  It's a matter with you.  Adam.  Yes.  It's her mom.  So?  You got a young mom.  Yeah, I mean, I don't know what other photo he could be talking about.  I bet your mom's pretty proud, huh?  Oh, yeah.  Both my parents are just, like, on cloud nine.  And actually, my parents have been divorced for 15 years, and they traveled to Russia together, 
[02:02:00]  stayed in the same hotel room together.  And my mom's like, the parent trap.  I was like, Mom, stop.  This sounds like a rom-com.  I don't want to know anything.  Yeah.  And now I talked to my mom yesterday, and she's like, me and your dad are just, like, best  friends again.  Oh, you know what that means.  No.  Oh, no.  I don't know what that means.  What do you think that means?  Oh, no.  I think there was a, ah, what the hell.  In the hotel room.  She's in Russia to win a new big gold. 
[02:02:30]  If they're best friends again, you know.  They're trying to win back a relationship.  I'll do the horrible rom-com.  What do you think, Jimmy, huh?  Yeah, I don't know.  A little something, maybe?  Yeah.  A little Russian vodka involved?  Oh, that's true.  Yeah, yeah.  A lot of downtime waiting for their daughter.  Sorry.  A lot of downtime waiting for their daughter to, you know, compete.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Where's he pooting that thing? 
[02:03:00]  You know.  Oh, they've got to tie in, like.  All right, well, before we ruin a nice relationship we started, why don't we get her out of here?  I was just feeling a little comfortable.  You know, it happens.  It happens.  Thought we could joke around a little.  I'm proud to say Caitlin is not abroad.  No.  She's a gold medalist.  Medalist.  Yeah.  In the half pipe.  That is awesome.  Very cool, man.  Congratulations.  I would go back for the closing ceremony.  It's a long trip.  How many hours is it? 
[02:03:30]  It probably takes, like, 24 hours to, like, get there and get back.  Did they fly you a business class?  I actually got upgraded to first class when I got on the plane.  They're like, oh, we have a seat for you, Caitlin.  Nice.  I was like, oh, yeah.  Going or coming back?  Coming back.  Of course coming back.  Of course coming back.  Did the pilot ask to see your gold medal?  Yeah, I took photos, and I got his wings.  Oh, nice.  Yeah.  What airline was it?  United.  Oh, nice.  First class international?  Very nice. 
[02:04:00]  It was pretty good.  Good for you.  You got to sleep on the beds.  That was about it.  I was like, you guys, I'm going to be snoring today because I'm going to get horizontal and  just snoring my life away all the way back to America.  And then you wake up, and it's like time travel.  Exactly.  Get those golf clubs out and get right back to work.  It's amazing.  From the minute you get on the plane, life is different now.  You got to go now.  Yeah.  Well, we've got to see the front for you, man.  Very cool.  All right.  Thanks.  Caitlin, let us let Caitlin go.  Caitlin Farrington. 
[02:04:30]  Are you busy?  A lot of press and stuff?  Yeah.  Kind of.  Yeah.  Just a lot of talking about how awesome I am, pretty much.  I hear you.  Yeah.  A lot of talk about myself and, yeah.  Me.  It's all about me.  Man.  You got to come back and see us.  Yeah.  Thanks for having me.  That's right.  In three years when things aren't so good.  Yeah.  Very cool.  Thanks for coming on.  Thanks, Caitlin.  Yeah.  Thank you, guys.  Calling into your favorite radio show can be one of the funniest experiences there is. 
[02:05:00]  Boy, how are you?  There's Joe Piscopo.  It's been so many years, sir.  You can get your point across and have a laugh with the boys.  How long did we know each other?  Isn't it the Eisenhower era?  Yeah.  It was a long time ago.  It was a long time.  But sometimes, things can go horribly, horribly wrong.  Without the proper forethought, these dream calls become the stuff of nightmares.  Hey, Joe.  Are you getting that young pussy now that you're single? 
[02:05:30]  Ooh.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  I'm trying to keep it nice.  Yeah.  Of course.  Pleasant conversations turn to exercises and extreme humiliation on a national level.  And I wanted to plug, too.  It's Scottsdale.  Yes.  Tomorrow night I'm at the Talking Stick Resort, which is going to be a plan.  Only the good place is for you, Joe.  Joe Piscopo.  And that includes Jersey.  Why the obsession with Jersey?  I think because I was brought up here and everybody's got that work ethic.  Because after the Sandy situation, we all joined together. 
[02:06:00]  It's bad you didn't have a beach house.  A room full of silence can only lead to irrecoverable damage.  What happened?  Hello, hello, hello.  I'll go home and get your fucking shine box.  So before you pick up that phone, remember, the next asshole could be you.  Hello, guys.  Hello there.  Come on now.  What?  Where are you? 
[02:06:30]  I got you?  A message from your friends at the Opie and Anthony Show.  We're not.  We're not.  We're not.  We're not.  Leave your penis alone.  The Opie and Anthony Show is back on.  Oh, I like this song.  Oh, yeah.  ACDC Day continues on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Caitlin Farrington.  She's nice. 
[02:07:00]  Yes, she was.  Winning gold in the women's halfpipe.  Very funny.  I just Instagrammed and tweeted the gold medal and it came out that she won the women's  halftime.  I am so done with this autocorrect shit.  Oh, no.  Did you delete?  And start over and lose my numbers?  Yes.  I'm not losing my numbers.  People are hitting that picture nice.  I'm not going to start over.  I just hope people can figure out what halftime means.  She won the women's halftime event. 
[02:07:30]  You know you're going to get a few.  Yeah, they'll be right on that one, though.  Sometimes even the Twitter haters are right.  I copy, delete, and then redo it.  The son of a bitch phone.  You spell out halfpipe and you're like, okay, but it already has, it already decided, no,  you couldn't possibly have typed halfpipe.  It has to be halftime.  But without that, I think you hit that space, it turns it to halftime and you're past that  word already. 
[02:08:00]  I know.  Without it, though, it might treat you to be a disaster.  It drives me nuts.  Without it, it'll be a mess.  Hey, Sam, were we a bit smitten with Caitlin Farrington?  Oh, my God.  You were like giggling with the broads thing.  Yeah, I call them broads.  She's very cute.  She's very adorable.  And then she has that whole stoner chick.  She kind of has that Drew Barrymore vibe.  Look, I don't blame you.  And I used to be a huge fan of Drew Barrymore.  Yeah.  But then like last week, you guys were like, and then they had that bite. 
[02:08:30]  Bite the metal every time.  Who bites the metal?  So the minute you see her biting her metal on Instagram, you're like, oh, look at you.  Biting the metal.  Look at you.  Biting the metal.  Oh, it's not just like that, did we?  Yeah.  We did, huh?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Who was the worst?  I think it was Ant.  Don't even fucking point at me.  Yeah, I got pretty bad.  I think Ant gets pretty bad.  Ant tells it.  I was bad.  I'm not going to lie.  I was bad.  Yeah, but then sometimes I'll be like.  You collect fridge magnets? 
[02:09:00]  Oh, but then sometimes Obi will say sort of mean things because he knows he's kind of  smitten.  Right.  So like he'll come out with something, whereas Ant will be like way over energetic.  I can't help it.  It's just, you're right.  I have a problem.  You don't give two shits about snowboarding.  Snowboarding, snow-shmorting.  And she's like, yeah, I guess the board's important.  Yeah.  She answered the question.  She answered, I can't believe it.  What a great ass. 
[02:09:30]  Oh, yeah.  Huh?  Thank you.  Yeah.  Well, I've been working out.  I think it's safe to say someone did behave in a professional manner.  Jimmy, yes.  Jimmy.  That's right.  You kept your composure.  I kept my composure.  That's right.  But more importantly, what did Colin think of our interview?  That's what I told you.  I asked Jimmy in the bathroom.  What would Colin think?  What did Colin think?  I was wondering where your line of questioning was going when you started asking her about  dating guys.  Right.  You're like, it must be boring for you to date guys who don't snowboard.  And she was like, no. 
[02:10:00]  But I mean, I'm just wondering, in that world, a girl who does that, what kind of fucking  guy do you want?  You can't just date a regular guy.  I bet snowboard guys are assholes, though.  They're probably fucking douches.  No, but they're all athlete, alpha male type fucking guys.  You probably get along.  But that's...  She said she learned guys are assholes.  And that's what she's hanging out with.  Scumbags.  Scumbags.  She probably got fucked over.  Right.  Right.  Yep.  She's waiting, looking for a cool guy.  Luckily, you got a room full of white knights in here.  All right, Sam.  All right.  Fucking white knights.  That's right.  What are you going to do? 
[02:10:30]  Sorry, Sam.  You're fucking sequestered married cock.  Can't fucking imagine anything.  Exactly.  That's a fucking big, delicious gift you have.  Yeah, I'm married, but I can still window shop guys.  The only thing I've always said about Obie is married, not dead.  That's right.  That's a good one.  Whenever I'm dating a girl, she's like, I don't care where you get your appetite, as long as you don't bring AIDS home.  Oh, jeez.  What?  That's what girls say to me.  I got to say, though.  Adorable girls are our kryptonite on this show. 
[02:11:00]  You're absolutely right.  We just fucking lose all.  I just completely fold.  Yeah, become human.  Right.  I know.  Become human.  I wish we could get that little Brazilian chick in here for 90 Day.  Oh, forget it.  Oh, pow.  We have to talk about the latest episode of 90 Day.  No, the finale.  Oh, we never talked about the other episode either.  Right.  But first, we got Bill Burr on the line.  Oh, Bill.  Ah.  Billy.  Billy.  What's up, Bill?  Nothing, man.  I just wanted to call in and thank all your listeners for helping us with the Patrice O'Neal 
[02:11:30]  Benefit coming down and showing up.  And I also wanted to thank you guys for doing a hell of an intro to kick off the show.  And, of course, Jimmy Norton going out there, showing everybody how it's done, crushing it.  So, another successful Patrice O'Neal Benefit.  Oh, yeah.  Thanks to everybody.  Yeah, it was great, man.  It was a great event.  And Ant said it wasn't as sad this year either.  It was kind of nice to be in more of a, like, celebration, you know? 
[02:12:00]  Yeah, I figured eventually, I didn't know when, but it would eventually turn into that.  And it's also kind of like the stand-up comic, like, high school reunion, too.  Yeah, no shit.  Because all those guys, like, you know, Jim, that's the first time I, other than last year,  I mean, I got to see you do, like, a substantial amount of time.  And, you know, I miss those days of being able to see everybody that I like.  Yeah, you know, it's funny, too.  And that was, I had to leave, dude.  I was in bed by 10.30. 
[02:12:30]  I was so fucking exhausted.  And I was actually disappointed that I missed Bill and especially Nick.  Because Dave I see often, but Burr I never get to see, and fucking Nick I never get to see.  Yeah, Bill fucking killed.  It was great.  Yeah, I was really disappointed that I missed your set, but I heard it was great.  But Nick, Nick DiPaolo's ass bleaching bit is fucking hilarious.  Or his opener.  Yeah.  I don't want to ruin any of his things.  He was, I don't know, why did I even bring it up? 
[02:13:00]  What did he say in the opening?  I missed it.  What's that?  What was his opener?  His opener, I can't do it.  I don't want to burn one of his things.  Okay, yeah, sure, sure.  I'll text it to you.  Okay.  Basically say it was something about how he liked, you know, oh, I like playing theaters.  I'm sick of playing comedy clubs.  And I don't know.  Okay.  And I don't know.  Well, you're fucking, you're, you're bit with the, uh.  Nick went like right out of the gate, right out of the gate. 
[02:13:30]  He just said something that just, uh, you know, I, it just was beyond anything that I  was going to say.  And it was his opener.  Billy, that fucking cop bit is hilarious.  Oh, that's a true story.  Oh, it's great.  Fucking funny.  Sorry.  I hope you went there.  I was driving through, uh, I was driving to an airport and I was late and I needed gas  to my rental car and, uh, the series lady said there was a gas station between, you  know, where I was in the airport and it turns out it wasn't there. 
[02:14:00]  It was on the other side of the airport.  So I drove like an asshole too fast through the airport as I drove through this cop stepped  off the curb and put his hand up, you know, she helped me to stop.  I know he wants, I know I'm speeding and I know he wants me to stop.  So I, I don't know.  I just pretended like I didn't see him.  And I just kept going.  That's such a ballsy move.  The fucking look on his face. 
[02:14:30]  No one does that.  It was worth it.  Right.  I think the reason why I got away with it, because he was so stunned I didn't stop.  Yeah.  He wasn't thinking I have to get his license plate.  Yeah.  There's no question that anybody's going to stop.  Dude, I got to tell you, I, by myself, I laughed like high school cafeteria laugh.  I'm not even joking.  For like 20 minutes.  When I finally got to the gas station, I was scared shitless because I was thinking, why  the hell did I just do that? 
[02:15:00]  The fucking way he, he was so fucking arrogant.  Right.  And I'm going 40 miles an hour in a car and he just comes off like he's the mayor of like  life.  I think it was good for him.  I think it humbled him.  Yeah.  He was so used to, I just do, he was, he was like, uh, who's the guy who parks the water?  He just came stepping up.  Moses.  Yeah.  And it just, and I get why he thought I was going to stop, but there's the other side like,  why would you think I was going to stop? 
[02:15:30]  Oh my God.  Hey, the great, plus you could always just say you thought he was waving at you.  Oh, sorry, Bill.  No, I, you know what's funny?  I've done that like three times.  Once to a cop, one time to a crossing guard in Wisconsin, this fucking soccer mom came  out with a stupid stop sign.  And she, she, I guess she didn't think I stopped quick enough.  So she kind of went like, Hey, with, with the sign.  So the second the little duckling kid got out of the way, I just drove right around her. 
[02:16:00]  I'm doing your assumed authority with your dumb fucking sign.  And I heard, I just heard her screaming as I went by.  And then the last time I did it, I did it at Hertz rental car.  I get annoyed with having to stop sometimes.  Like I was pulling out with the car and you know, you go up to the little house with it  sitting in and there was like three guys in there with this dumb Hertz, like white shirts  on, but they left the gate up.  Oh, I'm like, I know I'm not stealing it. 
[02:16:30]  I know it took all the fucking paperwork.  So I just drove it by the house and this fucking guy, he goes running out, running after the  car.  And what fucked me over was the person in front of me stopped at the stop sign.  So right as I was going to leave, he knocked on the side of the car and you know, on the  side of the tank or whatever.  And I fucking pussied out and I stopped.  But he was surprisingly not mad.  Oh, well, I don't think he can get mad at you. 
[02:17:00]  You know, customer's always right.  Kind of a thing.  Of course.  Right.  It's one of those things I do.  I'm a rebel.  I'm a rebel.  You're a mad man.  You're a mad man.  Bill looking like a million bucks last night in that suit too, Bill.  Very professional.  Well, you know, I, I, last year I thought I looked like a bum and you know, Norton wore a  suit, Colin wore a suit and all that.  And I'm like, why the fuck, you know, Patrice always wore suits on stage.  So I said, ah, fuck it.  I thought I was going to get heckled more for wearing it.  Well, we were talking about that too. 
[02:17:30]  How the benefits, all of a sudden the fans are, they're a little nicer that it's a benefit.  Right.  So we're thinking of calling everything we do a benefit.  Just to keep the assholes.  Keep the assholes at bay.  At bay.  Well, the same way this year, it wasn't as sad.  Like it was a little more just, it's gradually just going to morph into remembering.  Right.  What an incredible person and, uh, comedian Patrice was.  Um, I also think fans the same way.  It's going to sort of, it's kind of like, I remember like right after like nine 11, everybody 
[02:18:00]  was nice in New York.  Right.  Yeah.  Six days in, I remember I was standing and, uh, you know, that shit where you're standing  at a bus stop and the bus comes, but for whatever fucking reason, he doesn't stop and the bus  isn't full.  And I remember standing and looking at him going like, what the fuck?  I was going, what the fuck?  And I had my hands like, and I saw a lady on the bus.  She saw me and she laughed at me.  And I was like, all right, the city's getting back.  I think we're all better here.  A mere six days later. 
[02:18:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  By nine 17, it was go fuck yourself.  It's going to say, yeah, fuck you, wait for the next order, jackass.  Right.  Remember all the American flags you saw on the gutter on the side of the road that fell  off the cars?  All the cars had American flags on them.  When you started seeing them laying in the, in the gutters of the road, you knew, uh, we  were getting back to normal.  I figured once the cabbies took them off.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The cabbies had, they were like draped in the flag.  I'm one of the good ones.  Oh, they really were petrified, weren't they? 
[02:19:00]  Yes, they were.  Well.  They wanted time.  Yeah.  Good times.  Good times.  Good old days.  But, uh, anyway, to reiterate, thank you to, uh, the ridiculous support from you guys  and, uh, all the fans who come out, man.  I actually got to walk in the theater to do sound checks before, um, anybody had come in  and just looking in the upper deck, how many seats there, there were in that place.  Yeah.  You don't get to look before the show.  I actually got to look and, uh, you know, to know that they were all filled. 
[02:19:30]  It was a pretty awesome feeling.  How many seats was it?  I don't even know.  Do you know?  I don't know either.  Maureen handles all of that.  Yeah.  I'm going to guess 2,500 or something like that.  2,500 people were there last night?  Wow.  Yeah.  You have no idea when you're on the stage.  Yeah.  $300 for a hotel room again next to you.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah, the chiseler.  Oh, was that funny yesterday?  That was hilarious.  Oh, yeah.  I talked to her.  She was like, well, I didn't know I was going to go on the radio.  So it's like, yeah, you seem pretty comfortable.  She settled right in. 
[02:20:00]  No wonder where Patrice got it from.  I know.  There was one thing that she said.  Oh, that was...  Something about the hotel.  And it was like that classic Patrice, that healthy paranoia.  Yeah.  Slipping into ridiculous paranoia.  That was the fuel for so many of his bits.  I wanted to say it was like Patrice, but I was just worried that that was going to be too sad to say it.  But that's one of the many things I love about hanging out with Georgia is you see a lot of Patrice. 
[02:20:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  Sometimes she'll move her hand or just her thought process and you'll be like, ah, it's right there.  That's where you got it.  Yeah, yeah.  Right.  Pretty cool.  I got to say, now Bill Burr moves on to Canada.  He's putting a Canadian tour together.  How cool is that?  Canadian.  That's going to be amazing.  Conquering another country.  Yeah, basically.  You know, it's, yeah, I'm bringing, I think I might bring my hockey stuff up there. 
[02:21:00]  It's schooled when I'm, every place up there, they're going, yeah, we got a game going on if you want to go up there.  Oh, yeah, they'll fuck you up.  That's a good way to keep the touring weight down.  Some little five-year-old Gretzky across the pond in New Brunswick.  I'll do it.  Yeah, before you go ice skating in Canada, watch fucking The Omen 2 and see what happens during ice skating.  Oh, fuck, remember that scene?  You know how bad that fucked me up?  Yeah, it was really bad.  Every time I played pond hockey for about six years, they were sitting there hacking at the ice with that old guy with his fucking, his face on the other side of the ice. 
[02:21:30]  Oh, yeah, that was pretty fucking creepy.  That is absolutely creepy.  Imagine falling in and then you're going downstream, so you know you got to go back where you came and you just can't do it.  Oh, God, fuck that.  There was another movie that really creeped me out like that.  What was that movie where the guy, they were near a lake and a fucking, they were cutting down a tree or something. 
[02:22:00]  The tree lands on this guy on his legs.  It rolls over on him.  So he's sitting there like in probably, I don't know, like a foot of water.  All right, and his back is to like the pond.  So his buddy's sitting there like leaned up against the tree with like his shoulder against it.  So the guy's sitting there to wait for help to get there and he laughs.  He goes, hey, you know, if this thing rolls over on me, you're going to have to give me mouth to mouth or something like that. 
[02:22:30]  And they're joking about it.  And the fucking thing rolls over and the guy's under water.  And now the guy has to start giving him mouth to mouth.  And after a couple of times, the guy in the water starts laughing and then he drowns.  Holy shit.  Was there a scene like that in Deliverance?  No, that was a fucking movie where they got stuck and they had to do that to keep him alive.  I kind of remember that, the laughing part. 
[02:23:00]  Oh, what movie was that?  Yeah.  Shit.  I asked people for years what it was and I finally worked with this guy on a show, this guy Linwood Boomer, creator of In the Middle.  And he flipped out.  He was like, oh, my God, that's this movie.  And I, of course, never wrote it down.  But I asked that question for you.  There you go.  I'm trying to stump your listeners.  Yeah, well, no one's coming up with it.  I'm looking down here and nothing. 
[02:23:30]  Shit.  Now I'm Googling.  It's trying to be nuts.  Shit.  See what I did?  I started off nice, had a nice moment, remembered what a great time the benefit was.  Well, it's a great radio tease.  These people will be holding on until we give them the answer.  All right, Bill.  It was great seeing you, buddy.  All right, guys.  Thanks again for all your help.  And I'll see you back in New York soon, all right?  See you soon, man.  We look forward to it.  Take it easy, guys.  See you, Jimmy.  Bye, buddy.  Bill Burr on Twitter for all his tour dates as he heads into Canada next. 
[02:24:00]  He's quite the gentleman.  It's so weird having been doing this for so long now and having these comics on for so  many years watching where they were when we first started talking to them and where they  are now.  And I don't even mean like, you know, that there has to be this great success or anything,  but just how they've matured as comedians and as people.  Bill was kind of a crazy fucking guy when we first met him.  He was intense. 
[02:24:30]  Like, just fucking nuts.  That still comes out once in a while, but...  It comes out, but now, you know...  There's a maturity to it.  He's fucking, like, mature now.  It's like, oh, he's like a real man.  And now he's touring the world with his car.  Yeah, yeah.  Someone's got the answer to the movie.  We might have to call Bill back.  What?  Doug in Boston.  Yeah, it's called Sometimes a Great Notion with Paul Newman.  It was a good book, but a great movie about loggers.  Let the record show that on my comment screen here, it says, 
[02:25:00]  that the movie's called Sometimes a Great Notion with Carl Newman.  Oh, Jesus.  Who wrote Carl Newman?  Who's on the phones?  Who is it?  Some young lady.  I don't know.  All right.  It's our new lady intern.  What's her name?  Oh.  Well, that's fine.  What's her name?  Let's call Bill Burr back.  No, he's answering me.  Oh, Travis might be.  We call him Bill back.  What's her name?  Becky.  Oh, Becky.  Well, that's fine.  Yeah, if it's Becky, it's fine. 
[02:25:30]  So what?  Don't worry about it.  What's in a name?  Yeah, don't worry about it.  It's fine.  She probably doesn't know, you know, she's not old enough to really know Paul Newman.  Right.  Who's that fucking...  How is she supposed to know?  Who's that old codger?  Maybe Carl Newman, so somebody young hipsters like.  Right.  There's a great scene at the end of the movie where...  Oh, don't give it away.  I've got to be that easy on here.  Are you calling Carl Newman?  I sure am.  Hello?  Bill.  You're on the radio.  You're on the radio on my speakerphone, so I don't know if you'll hear the rest of the 
[02:26:00]  guys.  The movie's called Sometimes a Great Notion with Paul Newman.  Sometimes a Great Notion?  With Paul Newman, yes.  Holy shit.  I've got to go look that up on YouTube right now, see if anybody's uploaded that scene.  There you go.  We're going to look for it as well.  All right, buddy.  Thank you.  The scene is on YouTube.  All right.  Love you.  Miss you.  All right.  Bill Burr, everyone.  Someone just sent me a link.  To the scene?  Yeah.  I can't click it, though, on this.  Why not? 
[02:26:30]  Well, sometimes stupid pal talk crashes when you click a link.  I'm glad I could help, fellas.  See ya.  All right.  Look at him.  Thank you, Doug and Boston.  He's in.  He helps.  He's out.  I like it.  We got it.  Well, now someone's saying the movie's Never Give an Inch.  Okay.  Here we go.  No, that guy's an asshole.  Hold on.  Why is it Never Give an Inch?  Ed in Arizona.  Ed?  Yeah, well, that's what I was calling to say was the movie was based on Ken Kesey's book,  Sometimes a Great Notion, but the name of the movie was Never Give an Inch. 
[02:27:00]  Oh, okay.  Oh, man.  He wrote Cuckoo's Nest, Ken Kesey.  Hold on.  Oh, no.  You are not going to fuck this shit.  Can they just fuck with you?  No, they're not fucking with us, but what?  Sometimes, what was Sometimes a Notion?  Sometimes a Great Notion.  Sometimes a Great Notion is actually the book, but the movie was called Never Give an Inch. 
[02:27:30]  Never Give an Inch.  I was going to say, it's kind of a weird name for a movie.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Never Give an Inch.  I guess it was based on the book called Sometimes a Great Notion, but the movie is Never Give  an Inch.  But it says Sometimes a Great Notion on IMDb.  Yeah, what do you got, Sam?  Never Give an Inch appears to be the tagline.  The movie is indeed called Sometimes a Great Notion.  Yeah, there's a semicolon or a colon after that.  All right, did you hear all that?  The movie's actually called Sometimes a Great Notion with the what? 
[02:28:00]  The tagline.  The tagline is Never Give an Inch.  You idiot.  All right?  The title is Sometimes a Great Notion.  The title is definitely Sometimes a Great Notion.  The movie came out.  All right, Bill's had it.  Bill's done.  All right, we'll see you later.  Bye.  Ed, you're an idiot.  No, Ed's not.  Oh, yeah, Ed is an idiot.  It's true.  All right, Ed.  Ed's a critic.  Thank you, buddy.  The movie was called In Space No One Could Hear You Scream. 
[02:28:30]  Right.  No, it's called Alien.  Dummy.  All right.  We're very tough on people who make errors.  Yeah.  For a bunch of mistake-making motherfuckers.  Oh, my God.  They are really assholes.  Unless they're female interns.  That's true.  Yeah, Becky doesn't.  That's fine.  Becky's doing a bang-up job on the phones.  We got very good news.  After the break.  No.  What is it? 
[02:29:00]  What?  Oh.  Oh, but you were making fun because you made up a name?  I would have thought it was Becky.  I don't know.  We got very good news.  Lorna Dune.  Lorna Dune.  Leave Lorna Dune alone.  We got very good news.  What is this?  We're fired.  A Kansas bill would allow spanking that leaves marks and redness.  Well, Bill.  So we'll talk about that after the break.  Okay.  And we got to talk about the penis tattoo, which is absolutely the fucking story of the day.  What?  It's not the one that says... 
[02:29:30]  And then it's...  All right.  Moral.  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  ACDC day.  We got Shanghai, China that wants to check in.  Oh.  1955.  1955.  Is this the same guy?  Uh, from last time?  Yeah. 
[02:30:00]  That would suck if it's the same guy.  I'm hoping we have at least two listeners in Shanghai.  Are you the same guy, Butch?  No.  This is Butch Bradley, the comedian the other guy I was talking shit about.  Oh, fuck.  Okay.  Wait, was he talking shit about you?  Well...  What did he say?  What did he say?  Because we already forgot.  Yeah, we rolled.  That's how we rolled, Butch.  Hello?  All right.  That was Butch Bradley.  We got Butch Bradley from Shanghai, China. 
[02:30:30]  But he's got a shitty phone in line.  Yeah.  Try again, Butch.  Yeah.  I'm on Skype.  I'm on Skype.  I'm in China.  I have to go through England to even call your show.  Oh, let's see.  He said Butch was just doing crowd work and pandering.  Who said that?  That guy from Shanghai, China.  So now Butch is calling from Shanghai, China to defend himself.  Oh, okay.  No.  Can you hear me? 
[02:31:00]  Yeah.  It's a little bit in and out.  Skype stinks.  Stupid Skype.  Yeah, but I'm in China.  You have to use Skype.  I'm like sneaking under the China border to be able to talk to you.  Well, that's kind of...  Maybe the soldiers are coming and fucking...  Yeah, please don't get caught.  I would have tremendous guilt.  Oh, man.  The comedy scene here is blowing up.  It's a pretty cool thing to be a part of.  And there's a ton of Chinese comics. 
[02:31:30]  And there's comics from Australia and England.  Des Bishop's here from Ireland.  It's a cool thing.  The scene's pretty cool.  And everybody out here listens to your show.  So I thought I'd give you a call and just let you know about it.  Are you actually living out there or just staying there temporarily?  No.  No.  Who can I?  Oh, Blaine.  I'm serious.  We've got a horrible connection.  Yeah, Butch.  We're having trouble hearing you.  I was going to be walking first, too. 
[02:32:00]  I can...  Sorry, Butch.  We're trying to hear you, but it's just the connection's a little bit rough.  All right.  I'll give you a call back, or can you hear me if I speak slower?  Yeah, try calling back or something, because it's just one of those things where the connect...  We can hear you for a second, and then all of a sudden we totally lose you, and we're hearing  like every fourth or fifth word.  Right.  Sounds good, guys.  I'll call you back.  Thank you.  All right, Butch.  Butch Bradley. 
[02:32:30]  From Shanghai, China.  Wow, I guess...  You can't dial out from there?  I don't know.  I don't know.  China?  Who the fuck knows what's going on?  How did the other guy dial out?  I was trashing Butch Bradley.  Was that guy a comedian who was trashing him?  I don't remember.  No.  He wasn't really trashing him, was he?  I don't remember.  He was...  He wasn't kind.  Oh.  Doug in Boston is calling back.  Doug.  Yeah, I want to say, fuck you, to the guy who said I didn't know what I was talking about. 
[02:33:00]  And also, I just watched the clip.  It's about a 10-minute clip, but oh my God, it's brutal, guys.  I mean, that's...  Bill's right.  That's a really tough scene.  Henry Fonda's in the movie I had forgotten, and I forget the guy who drowns, but he's a  big actor.  But yeah, it's a really slow kind of...  It was Ned Beatty or somebody like that.  I don't know.  Who was it?  Oh, um...  Carlos Fzunk?  Was it... 
[02:33:30]  Fzunk?  Was it Carl Newman?  Carl Newman.  F-H-C.  Yeah, of course, Carl Newman.  I got it right.  Yeah, Carl Newman.  All right, Doug, in the end, you were right.  Congratulations on that.  Yeah, Doug.  All right.  You're the juicy stars!  We will be sending you...  We will be sending you an Opie and Anthony gold star.  All right, buddy.  There you go.  You didn't like that?  That was his out.  That was his out.  Good one.  Kansas Bill would allow spanking that leaves marks and redness.  Who's Kansas Bill? 
[02:34:00]  Old Kansas Bill.  Kansas lawmaker is raising eyebrows after she proposed a bill to allow parents, teachers,  and caregivers to spank children hard enough to leave redness or bruising.  Jesus.  Teachers?  You want a teacher smacking your kid on the ass, you fucking idiots?  I can't hit my kids, man.  Can't do it.  A parent doing something.  You want to.  You so want to, but I can't.  Have you ever wanted to at times?  Oh, yeah, of course.  Give them a little smashing.  Can't do it, though.  I just can't.  And we bring this up every once in a while on our show, and there's two schools. 
[02:34:30]  I mean, there are parents that are right now dialing, going, I fucking have no problem  doing it.  Yeah.  And if it works for you, and you're not, like, breaking any weird fucking law or whatever,  I'm not questioning how you parent your child.  As long as you give it a fucking try, that's all I care about.  But I personally can't do it.  I don't know.  Maybe because I got hit with too many wooden spoons growing up.  Wooden spoons, dude.  That's a little.  Yeah.  It's a great instrument, but.  Below the ass, too.  Below the ass.  What do you mean?  Like, on the thighs? 
[02:35:00]  Wait, were you doing a handstand?  I'll call my mom out on it, and then we'd have an argument that she didn't hit me below  the ass.  Because I guess if you're hit on the ass, that's acceptable.  But if you get a wooden spoon a little below the thigh, that's going to stay.  Man, that hurts.  That's going to hurt.  Rep.  Gail Finney, a Democrat from Wichita, says the bill is meant to restore parental rights  and improve discipline among the state's children.  Wow.  Restore parental rights?  What's an interesting idea about it? 
[02:35:30]  Who told the station, the bill makes it clear hitting a child with a fist, with a belt,  or in the head or body is still banned.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  I guess that's okay.  Can't close fist fucking right hook.  Right.  Just have somebody else doing that's annoying.  Who wants somebody else hitting your kid?  This is weird, though, because Ann talks about this.  When you take something away, you're never getting it back.  No, you don't get it back.  Like, what was the example you liked to use?  The strip clubs?  Bottomless strip clubs.  Right.  When you're the politician that does that, you're fucking it for everybody, because you  can't be the politician that brings back complete nudity and strip clubs. 
[02:36:00]  No.  You would look like an asshole.  You can't run on that platform.  You would look like a hero to many, but in general, you would look like an asshole that  you're obsessed with that as a politician.  But they got it done here in Kansas, where they're going to.  Current Kansas law allows spanking that doesn't leave marks, and now they're going for the  law that does leave marks and redness.  And redness.  Right.  That's sexy.  Finney's legislation would allow up to 10 strikes of the hand that could leave redness 
[02:36:30]  and bruising.  It would allow parents to give permission to others to spank their children.  Holy fuck, man.  This is real, huh?  That's pretty nutty.  Oh, okay.  There's another guy going, look, he isn't sure the committee will even consider the bill.  So she's getting some headlines today, but for it to actually become law, a lot are saying  this, it doesn't have much of a chance, so I don't know.  All right. 
[02:37:00]  Calling about the law.  I went to Catholic school.  Jim in Buffalo.  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  The Catholic faith is all about love, sir, so what the hell could have happened at the  Catholic school?  Yeah.  You're talking about a renounced Catholic for many, many years because of that.  But, you know, I went to Catholic school growing up, and it was just common practice that,  you know, we got beat with ping pong paddle.  So it was, you know, it was accepted.  And, you know, the problem is that today, you know, it's talking about installing parental 
[02:37:30]  rights back, is parents don't have rights anymore to punish their kids.  If you touch your kid today, most states have laws that the kid all he has to do is just  make a file a complaint to a teacher or call the local authorities, and you as a parent will  go to jail for abuse.  Oh, nurse.  Well, they'll certainly look into it.  Sure.  Yeah.  I mean, it's scary, you know, and maybe that's part of what needs to be done. 
[02:38:00]  I mean, I grew up, I'm 51 years old.  I mean, when we got smacked, you respected, you learned to respect adults.  Kids today have no respect for adults.  No respect.  Yeah, it's tough, man.  It's not easy.  I give my kid timeouts, and you want to hear one of the timeouts?  And when I say it, it sounds completely ridiculous.  I drive him to school.  Yeah.  And he gets to watch TV in a car, but we didn't have that growing up, obviously.  Hell no.  So his punishment, if he does something wrong before it's time to go to school, I go, 
[02:38:30]  all right, you can't watch TV on the way to school today.  Watch TV in the car on the way to school.  First of all, we didn't have parents driving us to school.  We had to fucking wait at a bus stop for the damn bus.  Freezing cold.  That's his punishment.  And I look at myself like, this is ridiculous.  Yeah.  It sort of works, though, because in his little mind, that's everything, I guess.  Horrible punishment.  It's a horrendous punishment, but in perspective, you know. 
[02:39:00]  I agree.  I agree, gentlemen.  I mean, like I said, I grew up in a time when, you know, you got smacked by your parents  if you did something wrong.  If you got in trouble, you know, the cops would smack you or the teacher would smack you.  You'd go home, and then the parents would smack you for getting in trouble and getting smacked  in the first place.  Right.  But, you know, I'm the same way as you, Opie.  I hit my child once when they were young, and I felt so damn guilty about it that that  wasn't who I wanted to be, and I never did it again.  And I did the same thing you did.  Pussy.  Yeah, I don't even. 
[02:39:30]  Take things away.  Smack your kids.  I don't even know if, I don't know.  Maybe I should be hitting my kid.  I don't know.  I just, it just, I can't do it.  I think there's that fine line of, you know, instilling fear into a child and abuse.  And I just can't pay.  Kids are today, though.  There's just no respect whatsoever to anybody.  Right.  I mean, well, my new thing with my kids, I worry whatever I do to them is going to be  their fetish.  Does any other parent think this shit? 
[02:40:00]  Well, there's nothing wrong with it.  Except you spank them.  I think when you're spanking your kid, that's going to be their fetish when they grow up.  I'm completely convinced of that.  Now, I don't want soap in my mouth.  I had that done when I was a kid.  That's not a fetish.  Oh.  I don't think my parents were pissed in my mouth when I was bad.  Yeah, exactly.  My mom never sat on my face.  My daughter has very biteable feet, so I nibble.  Oh, no.  When we're playing around a little bit, I'm like, I've got to stop that.  That's going to end up being her fucking fetish. 
[02:40:30]  Just be in play for your kids.  But I don't know.  I would love to talk to a psychologist about that.  Does that lead to the fetish?  Right.  Because a spanking fetish is a big one, right?  Yeah, he is.  I don't know.  But in regular life, this never happens.  The bulldozer.  Right.  You actually can have a conversation with someone on the phone in regular life.  Yeah, I don't know if that would become a fetish or not.  But a lot of people have spankings.  I love it.  He does that all the time. 
[02:41:00]  Maybe Dr. Steve knows.  Yeah.  If you spank your child, does that turn into a spanking fetish for that child when he gets older?  Well, it depends.  I mean, do you strike him hard or do you do it lightly?  Right.  You know, if you spank him hard with frequency, you probably should, you know, tone down on that.  I'd give them my wine and they use it to power their go-karts.  If you spank him and he asks for a price for another one and he's giggling and, you know,  he's going to go behind his head, then I guess you've got an issue. 
[02:41:30]  That's true.  If you spank him and you feel like a little rod on your leg, you've got to cut it out.  A little rod.  A minuscule rod.  Thank you, Jim.  I've got to go to Vinny in Staten Island.  Vinny has a story here.  Vinny.  First of all, thank you last night.  It was great other than Big A getting up and going, like, to the bathroom every 10 minutes.  It was a wonderful time last night.  Everybody was top shelf.  Was Big A in the middle of the aisle and had to just squeeze through everybody over and over again? 
[02:42:00]  Excuse me.  Excuse me.  Excuse me.  Big A went to the bathroom like 12 times.  He was in the third row from the stage in the middle of the aisle.  Oh, wow.  He's a lummox.  Big A, you better call.  You've got to apologize to a lot of people.  That's rough.  Did his ass stink?  You know what?  I didn't smell it, thank God.  The proper way is to put your ass toward the face as you're squeezing through.  All right, you've got to bend over a little and rip one. 
[02:42:30]  Start cutting the juicy ones.  Leave it.  Regulate it so it comes out the entire length of the row.  I hate squeezing out of an aisle.  Excuse me.  Excuse me.  I'm sorry.  Excuse me.  Right.  Anyway, what do you got there, Vinny?  So, and by the way, my real name ain't Vinny because I could probably go to jail for this.  But when I was a younger man, I was teaching special ed adults.  Oh, no.  These guys were profound and they didn't talk.  They didn't whatever.  These guys would punch you, kick you, bite you, shit on you, you know. 
[02:43:00]  Oh, sexy.  Sitting around one night smoking weed and like, you know what we could do?  We could give these guys cock shots and it wouldn't leave a mark, but it would hurt like hell.  So, that's the way I ended up starting to do is take them to the bathroom and give them cock shots.  With what, your mouth?  Cock shots or shock?  Cock shots.  You know, we'd punch them in the nuts, you know what I mean?  Bam.  Well, let the record show in the comment section of this phone call. 
[02:43:30]  I used to teach special adults and they used to bite us and we couldn't leave marks, so we used to shock them.  Yeah, that's what he said.  But you're saying you gave them a little cock shot.  A cock shot.  All right.  Yeah.  Thank you.  We have to cut this phone call short because Big A is on the line.  Oh, good.  Oh, good.  Big A.  How are you, sir?  How was the benefit last night for you? 
[02:44:00]  Get to it.  It was a great show.  I had a great time.  It was incredible.  Would you say it was stupendous?  Yes, it was stupendous.  Raging.  It's raging.  Just fucking get through the word.  What happens to you?  It's insensitive.  I love Big A, but stop with the ST words. 
[02:44:30]  Would you say it was outstanding, Big A?  Yes, it was.  There was what?  It was an amazing night.  And I was...  Oh, God.  Was it startlingly good?  That's a very good question, Sam.  I want to know.  Was it startlingly good, Big A?  Startlingly.  Startlingly good.  Startlingly. 
[02:45:00]  Startingly good.  It's going to be tough.  Yes, it was.  You're exhausting, everyone.  Oh, good.  If you could answer in a complete sentence, who was your favorite stand-up of the night?  Well, who was your favorite stand-up star?  Uh-huh.  Because there were a lot of stars on that stage.  Complete sentences only, please.  Yeah, so, wait, wait.  Stand-up, stars, and stage. 
[02:45:30]  Right.  Who was your favorite stand-up star on stage?  On stage.  And please, you know...  Rephrase the question and the answer.  Thank you, yes, yes, yes.  I would have to say, Jimmy.  No, you didn't...  Thank you.  No, but I'm here.  You don't have to say that.  You didn't rephrase the question.  Yeah, that's necessary.  You have to say, I would say...  I would...  You would say...  You would have to say, my favorite star of stand-up who was on stage was... 
[02:46:00]  Yes, right.  And then...  Right.  Please do it that way.  And then you say...  All right.  I would have to say, my favorite star of stand-up is Jimmy.  Nope, you didn't say stage. 
[02:46:30]  On stage, you almost did it.  Well, just, I guess, go back to the beginning.  Yeah, we should, I think.  Yeah.  So, once again, I'm sorry.  Sorry for the inconvenience.  Do you want me to say this again?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I'd like you to say it for the first time.  You forgot the stage, so it's...  My favorite stand-up star of the stage.  Star of the stage, right.  Was.  And then you could say...  Sorry, your favorite... 
[02:47:00]  Hands up.  Star of the stage is Jimmy Gordon.  Thank you.  Wow.  There you go.  Now, why did you...  Why were you peeing a lot last night, Big A?  Or?  It was only twice.  And let me apologize. 
[02:47:30]  I apologize.  It was only twice.  Wow, that guy said 12 times.  Yeah.  He was a liar.  Exaggerating...  Exaggerating a little bit.  Just say he was an exaggerating stupid head.  Oh.  And he needs to stop.  Oh.  He does need to stop.  And he needs to... 
[02:48:00]  Stop.  Oh, God.  What?  I forgot.  This makes you stop breathing.  Oh, yeah.  I actually stop breathing until you get the word out, Big A.  Fuck.  And for the people, because we get it every time, we love Big A.  Big A.  He's the man.  He's the man.  He's the man.  Big A, you're going to be part of Super Show 3.  Oh, my goodness.  Save the date.  Save the date, okay?  I think it's going to be what?  April, I think? 
[02:48:30]  First week in April, maybe?  Probably.  First day in April?  April.  Maybe the first Friday in April.  And I think Bobo's out.  Uh-oh.  Big A is in.  And I think we've got to bring Oscar...  Oh, Oscar is definitely.  Oscar is great.  Yeah, he's...  Oscar is great.  Dare you say he's a superstar?  I dare you.  He's a superstar.  Oh, fuck.  Jesus Christ. 
[02:49:00]  All right, Big A.  I'm bummed I missed you last night.  I ran it to you after the show, right?  Oh, yeah.  Yes.  Have a few beers.  Hey, did you ever have a...  That Trinidad wife of yours, right?  Mm-hmm.  Was that kind of one of those K-1 visa deals?  No.  Not at all.  So you weren't a 90-day fiancé thing?  No.  All right, people have been asking me to ask you that, because you told that story many 
[02:49:30]  years ago on our show.  Have you ever seen her again?  No, I haven't.  I've seen or heard from her.  And what?  How long were you guys married?  Um, a couple of years.  A couple of years.  Big A was married a couple of years.  And then she just took off one day, and that was it, huh?  Yeah.  Um, truly hot-headed and took off, so... 
[02:50:00]  Hot-headed?  Uh-oh.  Yeah.  Not good.  How dark was she?  Um...  Don't answer.  You won't be allowed back at the, uh...  At the compound.  You know that.  Don't answer.  Please.  As your lawyer, do not answer that question.  As your lawyer.  Say she was white.  Ah.  Which you understand is rare for turn it at, but she was a white woman.  That's what I'm thinking.  Yeah.  Well, you're not going to get the invite anymore, Big A. 
[02:50:30]  Yeah.  You're smarter than this.  I don't mind if Big A wanted to dip into a little of the old chocolate.  Obviously some dark chocolate.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, she was probably really dark.  He told me the sweet of the berry, the dark of the berry, the sweet of the juice.  But he didn't say and go, you know, I know that the dark of the berry, the swoo, the swoo, the swoo.  And I asked the idiom, I said, say it already.  You're wasting my time. 
[02:51:00]  I love Caribbean, Jim.  The swoo, the swoo, the swoo.  All right.  Thank you, Big A.  Take care, Opie.  Later, Big A.  It was good talking to you, sir.  We'll see you for the Super Show.  Super Show 3.  Definitely.  We've got to start organizing that.  It's on the docket, right, Sam?  Oh, yeah.  It's on the docket.  The docket.  Nice.  We also should tell the people it is Wednesday, so it's Opie and Anthony Podcast Day. 
[02:51:30]  Oh, what do we got?  Well, in honor of Patrice O'Neill and The Benefit last night, I believe it's the show  we all did when we all heard the news.  The Stroke or that he died?  The Stroke Show, right?  I don't know if it's The Stroke Show, but that's, you know, when we announced it as Stroke.  Well, which one was the one that had everybody in?  Everybody!  I think it was when he died.  Yeah.  Well, is the David Tell purple suit line in there?  Jesus.  Because that was...  Oh, that's when he died.  Yeah, so it's when he died.  We've got to get a giant coffin and a purple suit. 
[02:52:00]  Yeah.  That is in the podcast, right?  I would hope so.  I haven't listened to it.  Oh, boy.  Sal?  Sal and E-Rock were tandem on this one.  Wow.  Why were they editing jokes out, though?  You shouldn't...  Well, because we have to edit it down from four hours.  Oh, from four hours.  Okay.  Yeah, we can't throw four hours out there.  That'd be crazy.  That makes sense.  How long is this one, though?  Hour and a half or so?  Yeah, let me...  Please go get the Opie and Anthony podcast.  Let's see the numbers.  Let me see.  Stop touching me.  Speaking of the numbers, if you can, go through iTunes to get our podcast, because it gives 
[02:52:30]  us bragging rights, because that's where everyone is checking out the numbers.  But if you can, just go get it.  But, you know, if you have the option, go to iTunes for us, all right?  Yeah.  So it's everyone talking about Patrice O'Neal on this week's Open Anthony podcast.  It was a hilarious day, to be honest with you.  It turned out to be...  It was amazing.  It was a really, really funny show.  And, uh...  Let's see, uh...  Okay, I see what's going on here with the numbers.  Well, what have we got here, right? 
[02:53:00]  Oh, hello.  Who are you?  Okay, then.  All right.  What have we got here, right?  Okay, wow.  The Jim Norton Hates Animals podcast is...  Oh, who knows?  I don't even look at that stuff.  That's a good one.  I believe it's top three at this point, at least.  Right?  That's a good one.  Oh, who knows?  I don't even pay attention.  That's a big number for Jim Norton.  Oh, don't touch me.  If someone's got negotiating power, aw, shit.  We also got to get the numbers up for the Ricky Gervais Joe Rogan podcast, I see there,  people.  Episode 40 needs a little more work. 
[02:53:30]  Not much.  A little boost.  Just a little more work.  A boost.  A boost.  A boost.  And then this week's podcast, everyone talking about Patrice O'Neal.  Go get that through iTunes if you can.  If not, whatever.  Just go get it.  War.  War.  All right.  We're going to take a quick break, and we'll wrap up the show next.  Stay there.  No freaks.

Oh, God, I want to be inside you, Jenna.  That's the thing, is I feel like, um, I know I'll get on Twitter because I'll get mad and I'll be like, rawr, go crazy on Twitter. 
[02:56:00]  And people will think I'm nuts.  But in reality, it's really just me trying to tell people what is really happening.  Oh, man, here comes the pree.  And I haven't seen my kids for a very, very long time.  I'm able to see them only two days a week.  And, um, they charge me $400 an hour. 
[02:56:30]  Oh, that was good.  Thanks, Jenna.  Come here, Mr. Maloon again.  Daddy has something that needs cleaning.  Drink it up, get up, drink it up, my friend.  Drink up, drink up, drink up the Obama Kool-Aid.  I'm in chains, I'm in chains.  My freedom of speech is in chains.

Wouldn't you rather have a guy holding a gun on you  or a guy that's about to hold a gun on you?  Let me know because we're having a gun held on us right now.  Right now, right now.  We're having a gun held on us right now. 
[02:57:30]  Stop it.  Once you vote white, you know you vote right.  Right, like what?  Can I wear one of those out and not be beaten to a pole?  It's time for Whitey to realize we don't have to be victims anymore.  I'm in chains, I'm in chains.  My freedom of speech is in chains.  I'm the one in chains now.  I'm in chains because I can't say what I want to say. 
[02:58:00]  Let me know how long do we pay.  I hope the Kool-Aid's cold.  I hope it's icy cold.  Drink it up, my friend.  Drink up the Obama Kool-Aid.  How long do we pay?  How long do we pay?  Before people fucking act like  human fucking beings.  I'm in chains, I'm in chains, I'm in chains.  My freedom of speech is in chains. 
[02:58:30]  I'm the one in chains now.  I'm in chains because I can't say what I want to say.  Oh, let me know how long do we pay.  I'm fucking exhausted.  I'm going to need a nap.  Kids are in the pool.  Now back to the Opal and Anthony Show.  On Sirius XM.  I'm in chains, I'm in chains. 
[02:59:00]  Woo!  Woo!  One, two!  I'm in chains, I'm in chains.  I'm living for a woman.  Gonna give me good love.  Anybody want to hang up with me? 
[02:59:30]  And let me burn it off.  She was standing alone.  Over by the jukebox.  Last is something to say.  I said, baby, what's the goal in Christ?  She told me to go to hell.  Shut down in chains.  All right.  Nice.  Heading toward the finish line. 
[03:00:00]  And then we'll get our gold medals for today, right?  Nice.  Right?  A little Olympic tie-in there.  I didn't watch the Olympics yesterday because of the benefit.  Yeah.  Got some curling on the TV right now.  Curling.  This is a Swedish broad with black hair.  Oh, I said broad again.  Jesus Christ.  Oh, see?  She's got ridiculous eyes, and she's curling right now for the Swedish team.  Is that the one right there?  You'll know when you see her, and her hair's pulled back.  You can only imagine when she cleans up nice after... 
[03:00:30]  There she is.  She does have a nice eye.  Look at this.  Watch when she does the slide.  Is she probably a big scarred-up knees?  You get a really good look at the eyes.  Hold on.  I know this is a visual.  Oh, she stopped lining up like a giant stick of...  Oh, my God.  They went to this mess instead.  Peppermint Patty.  That was cruel.  Peppermint Patty's thrown to snow.  Exactly.  Nice hair, dick.  Fucking glasses.  That's who you want, pushing the thing to someone with glasses.  I don't know if Sean White was curling when he wasn't snowboarding. 
[03:01:00]  Oh, look at this fucking awful...  What a mess.  Gloves.  Sugar, sugar, sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet.  Sugar, sugar, sweet.  Oh, dumb.  Uh-oh.  Is it going to make the house?  Oh, we're getting close to the button on this one.  Is it in the button?  It does.  It'll be one for the Swiss, but that's a successful force for Team Sweet.  Yes, that was a successful force, of course.  Slip through the button, though, in the house.  How come they fucking didn't let us land on the Olympic logo inside?  Yeah, what the fuck? 
[03:01:30]  Sugar, sugar, sugar, sugar.  She started sugar-ing a little too late, I think.  Yeah, she's terrible.  Sugar, sugar, sugar, sugar.  I could have done that an hour earlier.  Yeah.  Sugar, sugar, sugar, sugar.  Sugar, sugar, sugar.  We got the tattoo story.  This is terrific.  Oh.  Yeah, poor midget.  Was it a midget?  Tattoo, I made it.  Oh, Jesus.  I was slow.  Sorry.  Man jailed for getting tattoo artist to ink giant penis on his friend's back.  Oh, no.  We've all done the shenanigans when your friend's fucked up. 
[03:02:00]  That passed out, right?  That's a crime, huh?  Well, is he retarded?  Well, yeah.  The guy is fucked up, but not from alcohol.  No.  An Australian man who got a tattooist to ink a nearly 16-inch penis on his disabled pal's  back without his knowledge has been jailed.  Oh, no.  Wow.  What's wrong with people?  Christopher William Lord, 23, was locked up for 12 months.  Yeah.  After admitting to egging on artist Matthew Francis Brady. 
[03:02:30]  Wow.  Lord was with Brady at his Queensland home when the victim came to the door.  Brady reportedly accused the man of raping a girl, which he denied before.  What?  This story gets weird.  The guy showed up, and of the two guys, one of them accused, like the retarded guy or  whoever he is, of raping a girl and, like, punched him or kicked him in the balls.  Right.  And then they started drinking, and then he got the tattoo artist to tattoo a giant cock  on the guy's back, telling him it was something else.  Holy, that is a weird story. 
[03:03:00]  The trio then started downing rum, which led to Brady and Lord convincing the victim to  have a yin and yang symbol, along with a dragon and tiger inked on his back.  Brady began to tattoo the man, but instead of drawing the agreed symbols, he started outlining  a giant penis and testicles.  Oof.  Underneath, he wrote an obscene phrase.  What was the obscene phrase?  We can handle it.  We're adults.  Afterwards, the victim fled the property and showed his back to other friends who told 
[03:03:30]  him what had really been drawn.  Lord, this week, pleaded guilty to assault, occasionally bodily harm while armed and in  company.  Hmm.  Damn.  The tattoo has since been covered up.  Want one of those cover-up shows?  Yeah, probably.  What do you got?  Let's see it.  There's a giant cock on your back.  You can make it into a cannon.  A Civil War cannon.  Yeah, why can't you make a giant cock on your back?  A giant cock on your back.  Let's look at it.  Let's see what else we could turn this thing into. 
[03:04:00]  Back on.  Oh, there's a story to this?  What am I reading if we could just listen?  Tattooed on his back.  What the fuck?  Tattooed.  Ay, nah.  A warning.  The details in our report offend some viewers.  Chester is bipolar, schizophrenic, and autistic.  Nice.  He's 25, but has the mental age of a 10-year-old.  He's got the triple crown.  Comes a child-  I love carcass on his back.  Come on, mate.  So if you want to be a rock, get a tattoo.  Tattoo.  Tattoo.  A tattoo.  He allegedly talked Chester into getting a yin and yang tattoo, but what he got was 
[03:04:30]  a 40-centimetre crudely drawn penis, accompanied by an offensive message.  I had no idea that was on my back.  Brady denies it was a bad joke, saying it was just punishment for a sexually explicit  comment, apparently made by Chester.  Do you think it was the wrong thing to do?  Why not?  I suppose so, yeah.  I suppose so.  But from what he said, you know, I sort of classed that as the right thing.  For anyone to do that to anyone, it's just, it's shameful. 
[03:05:00]  It's just something that's brought to light, the backyard situation that we have.  Removing the tattoo could cause scarring, so Chester's opted for the alternative.  A vagina.  People need a massive rubber tattoo with at least 15 hours in the chair.  Guys, I have the guy on the phone.  His name's Cori.  Yes.  I have the same tattoo on my cheek.  Aye, nigh.  Do they show what they made it into? 
[03:05:30]  I don't know.  Oh, Snuffleupagus.  Yeah.  Yeah, play that a little more.  Yeah.  Pinocchio.  You're playing with someone's life.  It's not cool.  Brady's been charged with causing grievous bodily harm.  He's due to appear in court on Monday.  Will you defend the charges?  No.  No.  You'll cop it on the chin?  Yeah.  Played guilty to it.  I've done it.  Save it.  Do not trust everybody you meet because the whole world is not as friendly as what you are.  Alicia Gaze is nine years old. 
[03:06:00]  Wow.  Good stuff.  Life lesson right there.  It's Bobo down under.  Life lesson, everyone.  That's great.  Aye.  Yeah.  What are you going to do?  Put a cock on your bick.  That's fucked up, man.  That is pretty fucked up.  It's such a bad job, too.  But I thought they all were friends.  That's what it sounded like.  Doesn't that shit fly with your friends?  What?  It's not a permanent joke on your back.  What?  It's friends like that.  Ah! 
[03:06:30]  Fuck.  Yes.  Troy Kwan gets a lot of tattoos.  We should ask him about this story.  Unfortunately, that shan't be allowed.  Until further notice?  Oh, yeah.  That notice ain't ever coming, is it?  Well, it's being worked on.  There will never be further notice.  No.  Notice stops here.  It's so silly.  Yeah.  It really is.  We lost a Devo guy, huh?  Yeah, 61.  What did he die?  Devo.  Heart.  Poor Devo. 
[03:07:00]  A heart failure.  Heart failure at 61.  Devo.  How do you say his name?  Bob Casale?  Oh.  Something like that.  He did the fucking...  Whip it.  A whip it go.  This was one of the heavy rotation first run videos on MTV when they first started, right?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I think there's a lot of brothers and stuff in this band, if I remember correctly.  Really?  They all look white.  Joined his siblings and brothers.  Yeah, Mark and Bob. 
[03:07:30]  Okay.  Mark?  Bob?  Bob and Neil?  Get it?  Neil and Bob?  Fucking potted plants on their heads upside down?  Who was that?  I was never a big Devo fan.  No, they were a little too weird.  I like this song.  The weird kids like that.  Yeah.  You liked this because it was gimmicky, but all the other ones are just like, ugh.  What about I Can't Get No Satisfaction?  No.  Some rolling stungs.  Didn't like it.  Travis, they had a good cover of I Can't Get No Satisf...  But there was schizo with their...  Yeah!  I know who had a good cover of Whip it.  Huh?  I know who had a good cover of Whip it. 
[03:08:00]  Who?  Pearl Jam.  Ah.  We're bird.  They did it at their Halloween show.  We're bird.  That's so stupid.  That must be stupid.  Yeah.  That's not stupid.  All right.  Can I hear...  Let me hear Pearl Jam doing Whip it, and then let's do Devo doing I Can't Get No Satisfaction.  Time to Whip it good.  What do you got, Sam?  I'm going to look it up.  I mean, it sounds stupid, though.  Pearl Jam doing Whip it.  I'm a big Pearl Jam fan.  I got to agree.  It sounds very stupid.  Thank you.  I really have to agree with that.  Oh, God.  And they were dressed up like Devo.  That is fucking stupid.  It was their Halloween show, Sam. 
[03:08:30]  That part of it isn't stupid.  No, it's stupid.  You uncut stick in the mud.  What the fuck's wrong with you?  Oh, I'm cut.  Thank God.  Exactly.  Oh, no.  Here he goes.  He dressed up as Pearl Jam for Halloween.  We're just having some fun.  Jesus.  Yeah, they're dressed like Devo.  People must have lost their minds when they saw this.  Uh-oh.  Can't hear it.  Sam, what are you doing, man?  Buffering.  Oh, boy.  Buffering.  Buffering.  Why are we still buffering? 
[03:09:00]  We shouldn't be buffering in 2014.  They're fucking...  That feels wild.  Snapping a whip thing.  Any better rules.  Oh, this is fucking buffering. 
[03:09:30]  This is crazy.  The cover's not as long as the original.  Break your mama's back.  Break your mama back.  When a problem comes along.  Are you my baby?  Are you my baby?  Are you my baby?  It's pulled it off.  This is good.  I kind of like it.  I kind of like it.  In the shed.  Can't stop.  Can't say.  Go for it.  You're my hair.  Let's do it, man. 
[03:10:00]  Seen and take it.  Let's not do that.  To women.  You got the lyrics in front of them?  Yeah.  This is not bad.  Why'd you stop the song, Sam?  Sam, I'm trying to hear it.  We're just enjoying it.  I don't like it.  Come on.  Travis, I'm with you.  That's pretty cool.  That's good.  I told you.  I like it.  Well, I don't like that he has to add in a syllable before women.  Why does he have to say, ah, you must whip it?  Ah, you're my whipper.  He keeps saying, ah.  Well, because he's trying to find his rhythm, brother.  You must. 
[03:10:30]  When a girl comes around, are you my whipper?  Why are you doing that?  Are you my whipper?  I don't care for why.  Are you my whipper?  I say whipper.  Yeah, I could.  Oh, I say whipper.  God, they went all in.  They look like Devo.  They're using the old instruments Devo used to use.  Those weird fucking Casio guitars. 
[03:11:00]  They're the fucking one.  Come on, Sam.  It's not breaking everything.  Doesn't that guy do Howard's hair every morning?  Oh, no.  That's him.  What?  That's not him.  I don't think the guy that does Howard's hair.  Huh?  That's not the guy that does Howard's hair.  Oh, you must whip it.  Oh, you must whip it.  Oh, you must whip it.  Oh, you must whip it.  We got a guy that was at the show.  Do you want to take the phone call?  Is it reasonable?  First person perspective. 
[03:11:30]  Yeah, let's get the first.  Eddie, what's up?  Daniel in Philly.  Hey, what's up, fellas?  What's up?  I was at the Pearl Jam show.  It was Halloween.  Congrats.  It was fucking awesome when they came up dressed as Devo.  It was right after the intermission.  It was like the first song they came out with.  And, you know, Eddie Vedder's up there in that fucking yellow jumpsuit.  It was a blast, man.  They do an intermission at their shows?  They did, yeah.  They do like two years.  Dude, your boy Christy's on TV right now.  What?  My boy song? 
[03:12:00]  He's on TV, your boy Christy.  Oh, look, someone's getting a picture with him just to taunt me.  How is it my boy?  I don't...  Former Governor Christy Yates refused to hand over the docks in Bridge Scandal.  They're refusing to hand over...  How the fuck do you...  How do they pull you in a room and pull your toenails out?  Oh, boy.  The United States federal government always uses national security as they're like,  we're not going to release documents.  Right.  What the fuck does the goddamn governor of Jersey have on these documents that he's  not releasing them?  I'm starting to think Governor Christy's hiding something. 
[03:12:30]  You think?  I'm starting to think.  Don't talk about my boy like that.  Can we hear the rest of the Debo thing?  Sammy!  Oh, you must whip it.  Oh, unless you whip it.  Break your mama's back.  Oh, when a problem comes around, oh, you must whip it.  Oh, you must whip it.  What would you do if James Bauer joined him on stage during this?  Would you just be cumming?  Yeah.  Like, ropes of jizz?  Yeah.  And your dog was running around shitting all over the stage. 
[03:13:00]  Stupid Sam ruined the fucking song with it.  Pointing out the whip it part.  Oh, you must whip it.  Oh, you must whip it.  He's coming back to watch.  He's got a whip.  He's whipping.  Oh, that's it.  Damn.  Well, what's the rest of the video about?  Yeah, really? 
[03:13:30]  There's a lot more video left.  There's a lot more video.  What is this?  Well, there's a lot more video after this.  Unless you whip it.  Now they're taking off their Devo gear.  Is that Evil Knievel?  Is that Evil Knievel costume?  Old school Evil Knievel with the cape.  That he's taking off his Devo attire.  Uniform.  I don't say whip it.  I say whip it.  Whip it?  Whip it.  Whip it.  That was a good cover.  Whip it.  I didn't like that.  Into shape.  Shape it up. 
[03:14:00]  Get straight.  Go forward.  Move ahead.  Tattoo detector.  It's not too late.  It's not too late.  To whip it.  I'll whip it.  I'll whip it good.  Why is there more to the video?  I don't know.  How much is that taking the outfit off?  They edit it.  Edit.  Is this whip it again?  That doesn't sound good.  What the heck is this? 
[03:14:30]  What song is that, Travis?  That's got some, but it does not sound in tune.  No, something was wrong with the bass and the drums.  They had to re-pack in the other instruments.  That wasn't whip it again?  No.  Nobody says it like that.  Oh, whip it.  Oh, whip it's good.  Oh, go forward.  Oh, whip it.  Oh, whip it.  Can we hear Devo doing I Can't Get No Satisfaction?  Oh, yes, you can.  Because it's a herky-jerky version.  I can't, I'll get no, I'll satis, I'll faction. 
[03:15:00]  A little louder for the people out there.  I didn't like this at all because I liked Satisfaction.  Right.  And this was just a bastardized version of it.  It's all over the place.  Oh, yeah.  This was an MTV video, right?  I'm not a very big fan of avant-garde.  There she is.  Oh, look at her.  Yeah, this stinks.  Okay.  Give me no.  What's he doing?  You don't like it?  No. 
[03:15:30]  It's terrible.  Fuck.  Yeah.  Avant-garde.  I like the other one better.  Yeah.  This is terrible.  Oh.  Just, if we're talking about a Devo guy dying, this is what I came up with. 
[03:16:00]  It's still terrible.  I don't know any other Devo songs.  We should just listen to more Pearl Jam covers.  No, we shouldn't.  I know Whip It and I know this song.  What else did Devo do?  Pearl Jam does a guy song.  I only know Whip It.  Pearl Jam did a great cover of fucking, um, I Believe in Miracles by the Ramones, too.  Great cover.  Or is that just Eddie Vedder?  No, it's Pearl Jam.  Travis knows everything about Pearl Jam.  We're gonna go home.  Bill Devane says buy silver, apparently. 
[03:16:30]  Bill Devane is such a braggart.  He's a braggart.  He really is.  And what doesn't he do?  He's a pilot.  He's fucking on a motorcycle.  He's, uh, on horseback.  Oh, it must be so great to be Bill Devane.  Well, my dad told me that I should buy land.  I did it, and I've done very well for myself.  Fuck you.  You know where he fucking, you know where he bought fucking land?  Where?  He did it in Munhall, Pennsylvania.  No way.  Yes, he did.  And, uh, why would anyone want to be there, Jim? 
[03:17:00]  Who the fuck knows?  He says there's some stupid Carnegie music hall that he wants to be around.  Yeah, why?  February 28th.  Well, I mean, I'm performing there, but that's not why I'm mentioning this.  There's nothing to do with it.  And then, uh, he also bought some land in Ontario, California.  Oh, thanks, Bill.  Did very well for himself.  Yeah, he said March 6th, 7th, and 8th is usually a great time, because he sold it, and  they built an improv.  Oh.  Um, but he said Virginia Beach is no good.  Oh, no.  No.  But he said if he was going to go there, he'd probably go March 20th through the 22nd,  because that's the time of year where things are celebrated. 
[03:17:30]  It's a little better.  Probably go on his airplane.  Yeah, he sold, uh, to the funny bone.  You know how you can tell Bill Devane did not do well for himself?  Oh, why?  He's on commercials for buying gold in the daytime.  Oh, boy.  That's true.  Hey, people are saying that song was in Casino.  That version of, uh, Can't Get No Satisfaction, was that in Casino?  Yeah, it might have been.  Yes.  It does, actually.  Yes, it does.  I don't know, but it does.  All right.  Is it during the fucking head-squeezing scene or something?  Oh, hold on.  Let's, uh, let's give Brian a chance here.  Brian, that song was in Casino? 
[03:18:00]  Yeah, it was in Casino.  I think there was a scene when they were shooting up the cop's house after they shot the guy with  the hoagie in his arm.  Oh, wow.  Okay.  Yeah, and they get out and start shooting up the shit.  Yeah.  I vaguely remember that now.  That's one movie I've got to see again soon.  It's been too long.  Greatest movie.  Of course it is.  Thanks, Brian.  Put your fucking head through that hole.  Let's say hi to Bruce in Rockland County.  Bruce.  Hi, Bruce.  One more fact about the Devo guy.  Hey, Bruce.  What up, boys? 
[03:18:30]  Hey, Bruce.  You try not to sound like that, dude, don't you?  Bruce.  Bruce.  Yeah.  Bruce Juice.  Got some Bruce Juice for you on the home of Rock and Roll.  Go ahead.  Here's Candy's room.  Oh, Bruce Juice.  Oh, Bruce Juice.  After they ain't related, but they do be brothers.  Oh, wow.  Is that a bad one?  But first, we're going to get some Van Hagar on for you.  Did you say Bruce Juice?  Oh, abso-fucking-lutely.  I fucking like that.  The Oaks knew what was... 
[03:19:00]  That catchphrase.  What do you got, Bruce?  So, the guy from Devo is on Yo Gabba Gabba.  Your favorite show.  What does he do for Yo Gabba Gabba?  Now I might get really sad.  He draws.  He's the drawing guy?  That's him, O.  That's him.  Get the fuck out of here.  No, it's not.  He just looks like it.  It's not him.  Get the fuck out of here.  Really?  Yeah, this guy, he's a little...  Wow.  He draws shit for the little kids on Yo Gabba Gabba. 
[03:19:30]  That's him?  He was a Devo guy?  That's for real.  That's fucked up.  Wait.  Yeah, but it's a different...  It's not the guy who's dead.  What?  No.  How do you know, Sam?  Because the guy on Yo Gabba is Mark Mothersbaugh.  Oh, Bruce.  And the guy who's dead is Bob Casale.  So, that guy had misinformation.  That never happens on this show.  That's crazy.  Didn't Mark Mothersbaugh have something to do with the Rugrats show?  I wouldn't be surprised.  Well, he knew the Whippet money was running out. 
[03:20:00]  He had to do something.  Wow.  Seems like a logical transition.  Wait, show me a picture.  Rugrats was a good-ass show, too.  Show me a picture of the Yo Gabba guy as...  Proven it's the Devo guy.  Yeah.  Okay.  That guy was in Devo?  No, I didn't know.  That's totally him.  I literally watched that fucking guy every day drawing some...  He did all the music in Rugrats.  He did?  Yeah, he was the music guy.  All right, but that guy isn't dead.  That's not the Devo guy that's dead.  No.  Okay.  Wow. 
[03:20:30]  Let's go home before we fuck up more shit.  I mean, right now, we're at gold medal status.  If we continue fucking up, we're going to have to take the silver today.  Poor the bronze.  Where do we get our gold medals today for this fine radio show?  If I could give you a number grade on today's radio show, it would be 104%.  Wow.  I want a gold medal.  That's gold medal.  That is a lot.  You mean a physical gold medal.  They don't even make them in fucking...  There's a factory that makes those stupid things.  Really?  Yeah, it's gold medals.  Gold medals?  Yes. 
[03:21:00]  It's in Tampa.  Oh, my God.  I'll be there in April.  I have to finish the plugs.  All right.  You were starting to look cheeky.  I knew that was leading somewhere.  Do I get cheeky when I'm lying?  When you're lying, the longer you go on, the cheekier you get.  April 11th and 12th, I'll be at Side Splitters.  Someone is saying that some of the shows are sold out.  I don't know.  I got a request.  Will you stop asking for these Sudoku puzzles?  I don't want to do Sudoku puzzles anymore.  Oh, no.  Look, I'm hoarding them in my pocket.  Enough.  Jesus Christ. 
[03:21:30]  Stop asking for these.  Like, Jimmy sent a picture signed, and I got an Opie Sudoku signed.  Anthony, could I get...  No.  You can't.  Stop asking for these.  I don't like doing them anymore.  Someone wanted a shell casing.  Could you send a bullet?  Yeah.  Right out of my gun.  Right.  Send one into your fucking head.  They just want...  That's murder.  That's murder.  Just need a piece of you guys.  Yeah.  Do we go to break now, or...?  Yo, yeah. 
[03:22:00]  All right.  We're going to go to break.  We'll see you guys tomorrow.  Stop.  Bye.  The Opie and Anthony show has gone to a close.  Stay tuned to reflect, relive, and get the story behind the story of the finest moments  of today's show.  Sam Roberts' Opie and Anthony post show begins in moments. </pre>
