<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with Anthony, medicated and seemingly out of it, and Opie joking about his colleague's illness-related absence.  They immediately transitioned into promoting their upcoming CD signing in Natick, Massachusetts, highlighting the participation of Stephen Lynch and themselves.  A lengthy rant by Opie about the disgustingly cluttered office followed, blaming Ben for the mess, which included ten Fozzy CDs, a "Rugburn prevention kit," used nasal spray, a substantial amount of pornography, and inexplicably, Mono's ass hair.  A trivia contest about Mono (a woman claiming to have the world's largest natural breasts) ensued, with a caller winning a Samsung DVD player for correctly identifying her.  The show heavily promoted the "Mommy, What Would You Do For Britney Spears Tickets?" segment, featuring listener calls detailing outrageous acts mothers would perform to win, including one involving a co-host's hammertoes.  A member of the band Future Chicken Farmers, whose demo tape was found amidst the office detritus, also called in.  The segment concluded with continued complaints about the office's state and further promotion of the Britney Spears contest.

The broadcast continued with multiple interwoven storylines.  The "Stalker Patty" contest participant, needing rent money, was offered $50 to appear on Friday, leading to discussions about a pedicure and other activities involving her and a 19-year-old.  The Future Chicken Farmers' CD, again mentioned, resulted in a phone interview with Lenny, detailing the band's music, internal conflicts, and a member's departure.  The hosts played and critiqued the band's tracks, describing the lyrics as ranging from bizarre to offensive.  The show highlighted Earl's incompetence in measuring the office (taking an hour, leading to the destruction of the foosball table), with Ben also implicated in the delays.  Frequent guest Jim Brewer was in studio, promoting "Stacker 2," and became entangled in the erratic behavior of Stephen Baldwin, who repeatedly called, seemingly obsessed with Brewer and proposing a radio show collaboration.  This led to a lengthy conversation detailing Baldwin's unusual and insistent behavior, leaving Brewer increasingly perplexed and uncomfortable. Ron Jeremy was also a guest, along with numerous callers contributing to the Britney Spears contest.  The segment concluded with the unresolved tension surrounding Baldwin's intentions and Brewer's increasingly strange predicament.

The following segment featured a chaotic in-studio visit from a disoriented and possibly intoxicated Stephen Baldwin, along with Penthouse Pet of the Year Megan Mason and Ron Jeremy.  The conversation was sexually suggestive and rambling, with frequent interruptions.  Baldwin's erratic behavior was a recurring theme, alongside speculation about his drug use and repeated attempts (and failures) to get Mason to disrobe on air.  Brewer expressed significant discomfort with Baldwinâ€™s presence.  Baldwin repeatedly left and returned to the studio.  The show concluded with Mason and Jeremy departing, leaving the hosts to recap the bizarre events, promoting Brewer's stand-up shows and Jeremy's documentary.

The final segment focused heavily on Jim Brewer, detailing his modeling misadventures, including a costly and ultimately humiliating experience with an exploitative photographer that culminated in an Aussie hairspray commercial.  Audio clips from the modeling school and commercial were teased.  The hosts acknowledged blowing off a contest and struggled to find contestants for a future segment, emphasizing the Britney Spears tickets and limo ride incentives.  The conversation was filled with vulgar language, sexual innuendo, and offensive jokes.  Stephen Baldwin was again mentioned, with derogatory comments made about his perceived actions.  The show concluded with a "What We Learned" segment featuring absurd and offensive caller comments summarizing the chaotic and nonsensical broadcast.  Uncle John was a guest in the studio, and the show heavily promoted their upcoming live shows at Irving Plaza with Brewer.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Walk it off, Dick.  Is that supposed to be sexy?  On your knees.  You're the ugliest stripper I've ever seen in my life.  No!  Shut up!  Oh, geez. I don't want to get the eggs, fellas. 
[00:00:30]  The eggs.  Hey, welcome to the Opie and Anthony program.  And I...  If you're in the New York area, 877-692-1027, please give us a call.  We would greatly appreciate it.  Anywhere else, 866-277-4WOW.  What's up?  How you feeling, Anthony? You look worse than yesterday.  I am... I'm in outer space, Opie.  You're in outer space.  I'm working... 
[00:01:00]  I'm working on a completely different plane of consciousness today.  I am... I am so far beyond our own galaxy.  Galaxy?  Uh, yeah.  You're overdoing it with the, uh, the night quill.  The day quill.  Anything with a quill on the end of it, I'm taking it.  And it's fantastic.  I can't wait to mix this with a little alcohol.  Tell you the truth.  Are you gonna make it to the end of the week?  What? Huh?  What did you say? 
[00:01:30]  I'm sorry.  Some little elf just poked me in the shin.  No, I'll be fine.  I'm not used to, uh, you being sick.  It's very strange.  I don't get sick.  Anthony has never taken a sick day since we've started working together.  I won't either.  And that's about eight years now, I think.  Seven or eight years.  I won't take a, uh, sick day.  I'm like Ripken.  I'm fine.  Ripken?  Yeah.  Do you count suspensions in your streak?  Well, that's true. 
[00:02:00]  Hey, suspension.  Do you count, uh, suspensions and, uh, and real firings?  Uh, yeah, I guess I should count those.  No, I'll be okay.  Like I said yesterday, I don't take sick days because I don't consider this, like, going to a job.  That's true.  This is silly.  This is a silly job.  This is us just goofing off every day.  If I was, uh, you know, if I had to go into an attic and hump some machinery up there and cut some metal,  uh, I wouldn't have been in.  I wouldn't have been in just when I felt fine.  I didn't care.  Right.  But now, yeah, I'm sick. 
[00:02:30]  What am I going to do?  Come in, I hang out on the computer.  We come in here, we goof off.  All right.  Uh, Donnie wants in real fast.  Donnie, what's up?  What's going on?  That's my favorite bit of all time, guys.  Oh, you like that, uh, Bush Trimmer guy?  Next to the fact that Spaz writes down his dates on his calendar.  Yeah, wow.  The Bush Trimmer guy, uh, another track from our cringe CD that never made it out into the market.  So, thank you.  Yeah, is the CD going to be coming out?  Are you working on anything again or what?  Yeah, we're going to fool around with that thing again.  We'll see. 
[00:03:00]  I think we're going to try to get something out by, uh, early spring.  Why not?  Why not?  I sure hope so.  Hope so.  I can't wait.  It would be nice to put a CD out there that people could actually find and buy.  Yeah.  You know, that would be something different.  It would be kind of fun.  I had a hard time finding the last one.  You guys signed it for me at one of the Stephen Lynch shows.  See, that would be cool.  Go out, do some signings, have some fun with the listeners.  Yes.  Uh, we're going to be doing a CD signing in Boston this weekend.  Yes, this weekend.  Saturday at Newberry Comics, we're, uh, we're going to be signing the Naked Disc 2001, Anthony. 
[00:03:30]  In, uh, what, Framingham?  Yeah, a lot of cool, uh, Natic.  We're doing the one over a nine?  Oh, yeah.  Uh, yeah, we're going to, we're on the Naked Disc.  Yeah, I know.  We put one of our bits on the Naked Disc 2001.  Uh, Stephen Lynch has a song on the Naked Disc.  Oh.  What Stephen Lynch song did we get?  Lullaby.  Oh, Lullaby.  Lullaby, very good, very good.  And then the rest of the CD's filled with some great, great performances from all the bands you know and love.  Yes.  Like, like Godsmack, Anthony.  Yeah.  Oh, Godsmack rocks.  Yeah. 
[00:04:00]  Thank you, Donnie.  All right, take it.  So we're looking forward to seeing everyone in Boston this Saturday at Newberry Comics in Natic on Route 9.  We're going to try to throw that into a, turn that into a little party.  Yeah, wow.  Moby's on the disc.  Incubus, uh, doing some acoustic stuff.  Radio Head.  Um, I'm looking here.  Uh, Limp Bizkit, nice.  Tantric, nice, Weezer, Edema.  Edema.  Yeah, like they weren't going to add the record, you tools.  Sorry, a little inside humor for New York. 
[00:04:30]  I hear, uh, Oedipus is going to be, uh, selling these on the side to make money.  Is that true?  Old gag.  Disturbed, Anthony's on this.  Disturbed.  Nice.  Which, uh, which song?  Uh, which one they, they ended up using, uh, Stupefy.  I am the Bull God from, uh, Kid Rock.  I love that song.  Blink-182, Papa Roach.  We're in good company.  Yeah.  And look at us.  We're track number 14, Anthony.  There you go.  Steven Lynch is track number 13. 
[00:05:00]  Any hidden track?  No hidden track.  Is there any multimedia?  Uh, I don't think so, no.  To put in?  No, no.  The Gorillaz disc has something on there.  Yeah.  That you pop in your computer and you can screw around with some stuff.  Pretty cool.  Pretty much all the CDs, you get a little something.  You gotta, you gotta do that now.  Uh, like we were talking about, uh, a while back.  That's how you, you keep from bootlegging the, uh, the CDs.  Right.  You want people to go out and buy your CD.  Give them some, some, uh, stuff they can't burn at home. 
[00:05:30]  All right.  Well, we have a lot to do on the show today.  Yes.  What's going on?  Oh, we're allowed to say butt hair and we're allowed to say nipple wax?  Thank you, Rick.  All right.  That's good.  That'll help the show today.  Well, it'll help this first break.  The first rant of the show.  The cleaning break.  Why do we start with a rant every day?  It's, it's, it's becoming a thing to do on, on the Opie and Anthony show.  Start the show with a little rant.  Every day there's a little something going on that has to be vented and, uh, depressurized. 
[00:06:00]  Yesterday, uh.  And thrown back and forth with the listeners.  Yesterday was some serious business we had to take care of.  Yeah.  And today I want to rant about the office, Anthony.  It's a little goofy and I'm going to tell you right now, I don't completely side with you on this one, Opie.  Oh, because you're a slob, too.  And Ben's like, thank you.  Shut up, Ben.  You're a slob.  It has nothing to do with being a slob.  Go ahead.  And I'm nowhere near a knee freak.  State your case.  No, well, you know something?  In the realm of our office, you're friggin' Felix Hunger.  Let me tell you. 
[00:06:30]  Well, I have to explain.  Okay.  How big is our office?  It's, um.  10 by 15?  No.  Tops.  Bigger than that.  Bigger than that.  I barely.  12 by, I'll give you 12 feet by 16 feet.  Get Earl with a tape measure.  You want to make it back?  Measure that goddamn room.  I'm calling it.  Get Earl.  From window, from window to wall.  And from wall to wall.  Right.  Not desk or anything.  I'm saying our office is 12 by 18. 
[00:07:00]  That's a 12 by 16.  All right.  Get Earl to measure it.  That means he has something to do with it.  Yeah, that'll give him something to do.  I'm working on the public file.  So, uh, I can't measure.  It's a small office.  Relative to the amount of people that we have in it.  We have five people that work out of the office.  You and I, Ben, Rick, and Stinky.  Are you kidding?  We all have desk space.  You know what?  We have five computers in there, right? 
[00:07:30]  I look at it like the bridge on the Enterprise, Ophie.  Not much room there either, but everyone has their station, and it's all set up.  But the Enterprise doesn't have junk all over the office.  That's the point I'm going to make here.  There's all kinds of stuff there.  So, I've been begging and pleading that we try to keep the office a little cleaner.  And none of us can understand why.  No one.  Because you guys are all a bunch of slobs.  Is it true that you saw something on TV that spurred this?  Ben told me this, and I actually couldn't believe that this is what spurred this. 
[00:08:00]  Well, I was watching Real World New York, Anthony.  Real World New York on MTV.  The latest in the Real World series.  I'm enjoying the latest edition of The Real World.  All right.  And it's filmed right here in New York.  And like the first Real World was.  And the kids, they're working at Atlantic Records, and they're going to radio stations.  Oh, they got cool jobs.  Yeah.  And everyone's office that you see on TV, it looks cool, and it looks neat.  It looks in shape.  There's no junk around. 
[00:08:30]  There's no dust.  So, you saw these offices.  I guarantee they don't go home itching their freaking legs because something's biting them.  Those are some of the guests.  How many times have we had to have the office bomb?  How many times have we had to have the office bombed because I got little bite marks on my ankles?  That was from the fruits and vegetables and food products that were sent.  That was kept behind your desk.  That was from Chicago.  Thank you, Chicago.  We had your rotting meat in our office.  That is a true story for about two and a half months. 
[00:09:00]  Now, I was a little stunned.  We had rotting meat in our office.  No one noticed that we had rotting meat.  You tell me that we have a problem.  No, they don't have a problem.  That's a problem.  That is a problem.  But it was resolved.  No one noticed that we had rotting meat in the office.  I end my case.  No, I'll agree with that.  I will send my case to the jury with that statement alone.  That our office is a pigsty.  No, I'll agree with that.  And this actually is an argument that goes to relationships at home where your wife or something calls you a pig or a slob and you're not. 
[00:09:30]  It's clutter.  There's a difference between having a half-eaten sandwich up on your night table and having your pants thrown on the floor.  Big difference.  All right.  And we have the sandwich on the night stand.  It's called rotting meat from Chicago.  That I understand.  And that should have been cleaned up.  We have bugs on the rug.  Bugs that jump up and bite you.  You have a huge problem with Ben's clutter in his section.  Ben is the biggest slob I've ever seen. 
[00:10:00]  But that doesn't concern you.  That section of Ben's part of the bridge of the enterprise.  Unfortunately, it does because we're squeezed into this little office.  Not only is it the five of us working there every day from 11 to showtime.  Yeah.  We have interns in there.  Earl has decided to camp out in our office.  Everyone camps out in our office, especially when we throw the homemade porn in.  I've never seen Sulu care if O'Hora has anything at her station.  That doesn't happen.  I made a list of some of the junk in our office, Anthony. 
[00:10:30]  Yes.  Now, this is stuff that has been thrown away.  Finally.  Finally.  I've been begging.  I've been begging, begging, begging for months.  Months.  Guys, come on.  Can we just look around the office?  There's stuff we could throw away.  It's gotten to that point.  It's ridiculous.  Okay.  Did you say bring me a jury op?  Yeah.  No, I said I would send my case to the jury.  And it's Mule checking in, saying you sound like Orson Welles.  Catch me a jury.  Catch me a jury.  So, I'm begging.  And Ben's answer is always, we need everything that's in the office. 
[00:11:00]  Uh-huh.  Right, Ben?  Yeah.  I'm building my case further here.  We need everything in our office, right?  Yeah, but we need a lot of stuff.  No, you have said in the past, we need everything.  You never know when we're going to play the Fozzy CD.  The Fozzy CD!  Even Chris Jericho gave up on the Fozzy concept.  Let me tell you something, though.  But we have enough Fozzy CDs to give our whole audience.  We should have one Fozzy CD if we ever want to.  We had ten.  We need two.  We had ten.  We need ten.  One to play and one for Opie to break. 
[00:11:30]  We had ten Fozzy CDs.  All right.  Chris Jericho doesn't even acknowledge that he even did that little side project, okay?  All right.  Send them up to Oedipus where he can distribute them.  So, I'm begging.  And Ben's answer is always, we need everything in the office.  And I would point stuff out.  He goes, you never know.  Right.  So, I finally blackmailed Stinky today.  Stinky!  God, you're like a parent.  Christmas bonus!  There it is! 
[00:12:00]  That's what Stinky's mantra has been today.  He's just chanting Christmas bonus.  Hey, it's a known fact that, you know, Stinky was the last guy in on the Opie and Anthony show.  And he doesn't really make a lot of money, okay?  He gets a lot of perks.  You know, he had a nightclub named after him.  Club Stinky.  Gets to meet a lot of cool people.  Hangs out.  Velvet rope.  Vanilla Ice.  Vanilla Ice.  Sign the wall.  Sign the wall in Club Stinky.  He's going to get like the hard rock in that stairwell.  And there's like memorabilia hanging up. 
[00:12:30]  All right.  So, he's got some good perks.  But the fact is, he doesn't make a lot of money yet, okay?  Right.  So, I blackmailed him today.  I said, Stinky, you see how this office is just beyond ridiculous?  Please help me out.  Please, like, start throwing crap away.  And just recite this in your head.  Christmas bonus.  It just goes to show you, though, you have to bribe people with money in order to have  them do your bidding.  Yeah.  And we all don't care about the office.  Yeah, that's true.  Well, then I've got to move somewhere else.  But I like hanging out with you guys. 
[00:13:00]  But it's ridiculous.  You've got it.  How is it ridiculous?  You're a spot.  I go home and I have to itch bug bites on my ankles.  I don't think bugs are eating the Fozzie CDs.  We got rid of the food.  It adds to it, my friend.  And then he tells Eddie, the garbage guy, to throw away everything he sees on Ben's little  desk.  That's right.  Which, I tell you, he will then do it.  Why is he breaking that wall?  Because you think that it's funny to tell Eddie.  But he'll do it.  He'll throw away everything.  Oh, they call me garbage.  Garbage. 
[00:13:30]  Stinky.  Because I'm going to take a lot of abuse just bringing this up.  And that's okay.  Explain seriously Ben's area of the office that you sit right next to.  It's just a pile of crap.  A pile of crap.  Would you say a foot and a half high?  Easily.  How do you know where it's crap, though?  This is stuff he uses.  He knows what's there.  I guarantee if we took a box, shoved everything from Ben's desk into the box and brought it  in the studio, we would find stuff he would never, never use.  Well, you never know. 
[00:14:00]  Maybe a couple things.  But a majority of that every day.  A couple of things.  You go through that pile.  I actually did go through that pile about a week ago, to be honest with you.  And there was a lot of stuff I needed.  I don't know.  You want a law office with the books?  No.  I just want an office where there's cool things on the walls and not a lot of clutter.  We've got great things on the walls.  You can't see it.  Half the stuff was covered up.  We found old posters and stuff after Stinky was rearranging the porn section. 
[00:14:30]  Did you hear what I said when Stinky came in with the bag?  What was my concern?  You said, you're not throwing away the porn, are you?  I saw him getting up, ready to take some stuff off the shelf.  I'm like, you're not throwing away the porn, are you?  Look.  Oh.  Look, we're in agreement with the porn, okay?  Right?  I have no problem.  Well, I threw away some of the homemade porn that we got recently, but I think we all agreed  that most of that stuff sucked.  And did you see what people have been doing?  I see Stinky throwing away boxes and boxes of porn.  They're empty.  People have been taking the porno out and putting the empty boxes back so no one will notice.  And half of those boxes were empty. 
[00:15:00]  No joke, we could open up a video store with the amount of porno we have in our office.  Is that true?  Do we have hundreds of titles?  Hundreds?  All the Yellow Discipline videos are gone now.  Really?  Oh, I wonder who took those, Norton.  I wonder who took those.  So, to make a long story short, yeah, I blackmailed Stinky and made him pretty excited about  something called a Christmas bonus.  Yeah.  Is it going to be a Monopoly board?  No.  There's one for New York.  Very good. 
[00:15:30]  Oh, my God, Stinky.  Wow.  A WNEW Monopoly board.  Remember when Scott Herman, our old general manager here at the station in New York,  he gave us bonuses one Christmas.  And we're really, like, trying to do our best here at the station.  And it was during a very hard time here at the station.  And we actually started making some headway, and we were feeling pretty good about it.  And Scott invites us up into his office for a little Christmas cheer and hands us our bonuses. 
[00:16:00]  It was a WNEW radio station version of Monopoly.  Monopoly.  Or New York version.  No, the New York version.  It wasn't even an EW.  It was a New York version.  But EW was on the board, I believe.  It was featured as one of the little places you land.  Right.  And we're like, gee, thanks.  Yeah, this is a great bonus.  One of the figures you can move around the board was Scott Muni, though.  Was it Scott?  That was kind of cool.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, virgin.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  And then there's the Earl figure where you don't get to move it for some reason. 
[00:16:30]  You roll the dice, and it just doesn't move.  There's no way to move it.  Pass, go, collect 200.  Nope.  Stay in here.  Earl landed on the public file, and he's not moving.  What happened?  And the N.E.W. van is just in the garage section, and it can't move because it's broken.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  That's pretty funny.  And you've got to mail away for new pieces constantly?  Constantly mail away.  Because the old pieces are getting fired.  I always try to look for the Ken Stevens piece, but it's never here. 
[00:17:00]  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Hey, Ken Stevens is our hero.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  It's never here.  We like Ken Stevens.  Right.  Anyway, so I think you started throwing things away.  Thank God.  Uh-huh.  Now, I look at the phones.  I'm getting abused really, really bad.  You know something?  My brother can kiss my ass.  Why?  Hold on.  Joe.  Brother Joe.  Yeah, I was just saying, you know, you're fighting a losing battle.  Why?  Because there's absolutely no way you're going to keep the office clean. 
[00:17:30]  If the way the apartment that I shared with my brother is any indication on the way that  office is going to shape up, you're in for years of just crap piling up, and there's  nothing you can do about it.  And go ahead.  Kiss my ass?  What?  And clean it up, then.  You lived there.  You lived there.  I did it.  And if you remember correctly, you used to call me Hazel.  We used to call Joe Hazel.  Me, Adam, Joe Curry, all of us would call you Hazel.  Because we're sitting around.  We didn't care. 
[00:18:00]  It was a crap hole apartment.  It was like a crash pad.  We'd be drinking all the time.  The coffee table stacked with pyramids of beer cans.  I swear to you.  You would stack them up and go, you'd be drinking beer going, I have nowhere else to  put this beer.  And perish the thought I get up.  And then you'd just keep stacking them.  And then Joe would come by with a vacuum going, this place is goddamn disgusting.  And we'd all be laughing at him going, Hazel, Hazel, kick back.  You see where it's going?  There's no way you're going to win, bro.  It's called a party pad. 
[00:18:30]  You know, brother?  It was.  And I wouldn't have minded just the beer cans, but I mean the two-week-old pizzas and the  half bags of Doritos.  Oh, if you'd have gotten your own place, goddammit, you wouldn't have had to live there.  Actually, yeah, you got a point.  I'm out of here, boys.  I'm just surprised that you guys shared a car.  Yeah, right?  My car.  When I lived in my car.  Are you talking about the bog?  All right.  No, and I had my car and I had to live in it for like three months.  All right, Joe.  I did that, too.  All right, Joe.  Thank you.  Later, man.  I must say, though, Anthony's section isn't a problem in my eyes. 
[00:19:00]  Your area's not that bad.  My desk is very...  It's the whole area near Ben and above Ben.  That drives me nuts.  I have the Canyon of Doom behind my desk.  See, I add new stuff to my desk and the old stuff slowly gets pushed off the back and  just falls off into the Canyon of Doom.  And I forget about it.  But it's back there.  Go look into the Canyon of Doom.  I bet you we'll find some treats there, too.  When we go to break.  It was recently cleaned.  It was?  Okay.  So I'm getting abused bad on the phone lines. 
[00:19:30]  But I made a list of some of the things I was able to convince the guys that we really  need to throw away.  Okay?  Uh-huh.  And here's the list.  And this is no joke.  This is stuff we threw away today that Ben said for probably over a year that we'll sometime  need on the show.  I said the 10 Fozzy CDs, Anthony.  They are now gone.  The Fozzy CDs gone?  Sorry, Chris Jericho.  But like I said, Chris Jericho doesn't even care about that little side thing called Fozzy anymore.  Yeah, it was a goof.  Uh, we threw away the Rugburn prevention kit. 
[00:20:00]  What was that?  It was, uh, the Rugburn prevention kit.  A BJ gag gift?  Pretty much.  It had knee pads.  Get Stinky in here for the rest of this break, because Stinky knows this stuff better than  I do.  All right.  Stinky, what was in the Rugburn prevention kit besides the, uh, besides the, uh, the knee  pads?  Do you remember?  Wasn't there like something else?  It was just like foam, foamy styrofoam things for padding.  That must be, yeah, some stripper, uh, or, uh, adult, uh, novelty person. 
[00:20:30]  That's gone.  Uh, we threw away the nasal spray.  Yeah, all of a sudden, Stinky goes, you need nasal spray?  It's like, no, what?  It's, it's like this disgusting, we don't know whose nose it's been up, nasal spray just  sitting there, and no one will claim it, which means that it didn't come from any of us.  Well, we gave it to you.  Yeah.  But we need it for some reason, according to Ben.  I threw away Ben's desk fan.  That wasn't nice.  Yeah, why did you throw that away?  I was given, that was a gift, uh, from my friend Eric a few years ago. 
[00:21:00]  You never plugged it in.  I had it, in fact, when I used to have a different office, you used to come by and go, that's  a cool fan.  See?  He tossed it away.  I threw it away.  There was a lot of dust on it, and you haven't plugged it in in years.  Paul from Centerreach, very concerned.  No, no Olsen twin stuff was thrown away.  No, no, no, no.  I grabbed that.  I'm not that crazy.  Yeah.  Uh, we gotta update the poster, though.  Why?  That's a hot poster.  I saw them on.  No, there's a picture in, uh, the back of, uh, the latest issue of Maxim magazine that makes  that poster look very, very old.  Give me the magazine. 
[00:21:30]  I just saw a special on them.  It's in my, uh, book bag.  Hold on, after the break.  I just saw a special on them, uh, on, uh, I don't know, it might have been E somewhere,  and, uh, they showed, like, brand spanking new video of them.  They're in high school now.  They're high school girls, and they are looking so hot.  It's ridiculous now.  It's ridiculous.  It is.  There is not one, uh, man in their, uh, right mind that would turn those, uh, two down.  Ha ha.  All right.  Ha ha ha.  Ha ha.  Yeah, we'll get into pee with you.  What's pee-wee into? 
[00:22:00]  We'll get into pee-wee.  We're going to find out sooner than later about pee-wee.  Ah!  Yeah.  Uh, I was able to, uh, get stinky to throw away the box.  Not one or two.  The box of erotica survivor posters.  Erotica survivor.  Oh, that was a bad video.  Horrible pornos.  Yeah.  It wasn't even good.  You can't call it porno.  No.  It was hard R.  Tops.  Yeah.  There was topless.  They weren't even topless.  I hate hard R. 
[00:22:30]  Uh.  Sucks.  They just show the guy's face all the time.  Uh, sorry to the local band, uh, that's called Future Chicken Farmers, but, uh, we got rid of your CD.  We threw away Future Chicken Farmers CD.  Threw it away, Anthony.  Wait, Al.  Um, I might have cared if I had known we even had it in the first place.  There was even a note on the CD.  Sorry, the quality sucks, but, uh, this is the best we could do.  But we were going to play it eventually.  Uh, the Blair Witch 2.  Candle.  Very key.  Blair Witch 2 Candle.  Blair Witch 2 Candle? 
[00:23:00]  Yes.  All right.  Uh, Shannon's Nipple Wax had a bite to dust, finally.  Where'd you find Shannon's Nipple Wax?  Covered in the dust above Ben's desk.  What was that from?  Remember Hot, Hot, uh, Swax Shatter?  Yeah, we were doing the, uh, the, uh, dropping the wax from way up.  Right, okay, and we peeled the wax off and saved it for some reason.  And we saved it because we were going to give them away as part of an Opie and Anthony Pride.  No, you know what it is?  It's the souvenirs like serial killers keep little pieces of, uh, things. 
[00:23:30]  Yeah.  That's what it's like.  We didn't need that around.  Oh, no.  Uh, the Voodoo Rudy doll.  Voodoo Rudy doll.  He's kind of a cool guy now.  So what are you going to do with the Voodoo Rudy doll?  Uh, all right.  This one really freaked me out.  And I don't even remember this bit.  Stinky had to remind us because it was like his first day as an intern.  Yeah.  Mono's ass hair.  Why the hell were we keeping Mono's ass hair? 
[00:24:00]  And who the hell is Mono?  Mono.  We should give a prize to the person that can tell us who Mono is.  Mono.  Don't even say what it is.  Because after break, we'll give a prize to the person that can tell us who Mono is.  I do not remember Mono.  Stinky knows the story, right?  Yeah, definitely.  All right.  Do we have Brewer tickets for tonight's show at Irving Plaza?  Tomorrow night.  We can give them tomorrow night.  All right.  We'll give you a pair of tickets to see Jim Brewer at Irving Plaza tomorrow night.  If you can't go, we'll give you something else.  Tell us who Mono was and why do we have her ass hair.  It's a her.  It's a her, right? 
[00:24:30]  Yes.  Yeah.  Okay.  Opie, by the way, John from Cleveland checking in saying, Foz, he's actually working on another  CD.  No way.  That info from WWF.com.  See?  All right.  See?  It's relevant.  Also on my list, so we can take a break here, used thongs.  Oh, man.  Those were disgusting.  I don't even think Norton would bring those home, okay?  Used thongs right next to the used teen undergarments.  Oh, wait.  We threw that away?  Little baby tees and...  Yeah. 
[00:25:00]  He didn't want it.  Oh, man.  The stuff Corinne wore.  Wow.  What?  I'm just in case...  There was Dawson's stuff on it.  You have some teens in again.  The South Park Chef Lamp.  Who cares?  I wanted to get rid of Ben's Phillips CD burner.  Well, it's taken up a lot of space.  It's a huge box.  It's up on a shelf that is not even used.  I have my CD burner here.  I was trying to trade it for something a year ago.  You can't trade it for anything.  It's probably the first CD burner that ever came out.  It's actually a really good one.  His CD burner is like six feet by four feet.  It's so big.  For some reason, I just bought a CD burner. 
[00:25:30]  And the box that came in, about the size of, I don't know, a Pop-Tarts box.  Okay.  And the one that Ben has up on the shelf is as big as if you get an old VCR.  An old VCR.  Not even the newer ones, because this is a thick box, too.  It's huge.  It's huge.  It's been sitting there for over a year and a half.  You know what?  I am on Ben's side as far as if he wants to keep it there, I could give a crap.  But, Ben, that probably is the most dated piece of electronics that you're ever going to find. 
[00:26:00]  What are you going to do with that?  I was trying to trade it a year ago for tickets to the U2 show.  A year ago is the key thing.  Technology and year.  CD burners over the course of the past year have come leaps and bounds.  So, why don't you, you know, try to trade your video games from the last year.  Yeah.  The Mr. T doll had a go.  The M&M action figure had a go.  You threw away the M&M action figure?  Why didn't you throw that away?  The carpet stain remover. 
[00:26:30]  Obviously, it wasn't being used.  The rug is beyond disgusting.  See, that should have gone into the prize closet, the M&M action figure.  Just relegate it to the prize closet for some dopey prize, maybe.  Absolutely.  The David Hasselhoff CD.  Huh?  What?  Son of a bitch!  The Nasty Santa doll.  Nasty Santa doll.  That talks and farts.  Yeah, ha ha.  The Kung Fu hamster is biting the dust. 
[00:27:00]  I want to thank Newberry Comics.  I think they sent us the Kung Fu hamster.  It was Kung Fu fighting.  Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.  It spins around a little mace.  Right.  And it sings and dances Kung Fu fighting.  Ding, ding, ding.  And finally, the motion-activated fart alarm had to go.  And it may have had a gun pulled on it the other day.  Which, the hamster?  I think it did.  So that's it.  And Stinky was only working for, seriously, half hour, 40 minutes?  I mean, you barely scratched the surface. 
[00:27:30]  I cleaned the whole top shelf off and my area.  This is going to be a running bit for the next few weeks.  Because cleaning up?  We haven't even got...  Well, no.  Well, we've got to see what Ben is hiding under that pile of crap.  Rick's got a lot of crap by him.  Then we have to get to Rick's section.  Don't even touch my stuff.  Ben's got a lot of, like, paperwork and stuff.  It's stuff with notes on it and whatnot that I'm sure he knows if he needs something, he can  go through those papers and find maybe a number or a name or whatever it is. 
[00:28:00]  So it's not like you're going to find these big, cluttered boxes of stuff.  It's his area.  It's that and a lot of relevant CDs.  They pop on a different CD every morning.  Yeah.  He's got his little CD collection there that he goes through.  I don't know.  All right.  We've got to take a break.  I don't see a problem.  You forgot your autographed who was the WWF thing.  Oh, Bubba Ray and Dudley.  It was a fake autograph.  Bubba Ray and Dudley.  That you guys wrote out while I was at lunch, you idiots.  Yeah, they told you pretty good when you went out to lunch. 
[00:28:30]  They put a bunch of the crap right on Opie's desk.  All right.  Quick break.  When we come back, tell us who Mono was and why do we have her ass hair.  And we'll give you some brewer tickets or whatever you want from the O&A prize closet.  Okay?  Right.  All this week with Opie and Anthony, it's Mommy, what would you do for Britney Spears tickets?  So, if you're a mommy, call now.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Hey, Anthony, ski stops. 
[00:29:00]  Ski stop.  Ski stop.  That's right.  The attic at Ski Stop, the East Coast's largest snowboarding center.  That's right.  You heard about the attic?  Has everything snowboarding at the guaranteed lowest prices.  Racks filled with snowboards by Burton Sims, Morrow, Nitro, Ride, Oxygen, and more.  Clothing by S&P, Bombshell, Rusty, Quicksilver, Dirty Snow, and more.  And step into bindings by Switch, device, Neidecker, plus staff that knows snowboarding inside and out. 
[00:29:30]  It's the attic at Ski Stop, where snowboarding experience comes together.  If you're a snowboarding fanatic, don't be a dick.  Get to the attic at Ski Stop.  LIE, exit 48 South Service Road in Plainview, Long Island.  Don't be a dick.  Of course.  Lisa Orban.  Get to the attic at Ski Stop.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  1027 WNEW.  New York's on the strokes. 
[00:30:00]  Last night.  We're back with the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Got to give away this prize and then we'll move on to other things, man.  We were cleaning out our office.  Threw away a lot of crap.  Yeah.  One of those things was Mano's ass hair.  Mano's ass hair.  Actual ass hair that was in a little plastic bag.  Right.  Just hanging out on the shelf for well over a year.  But I don't remember who Mano was. 
[00:30:30]  It slipped my mind.  Stinky remembers.  So the first person who gets it on the phone, we'll get Brewer Takers or whatever you want, okay?  Brewer playing Irving Plaza tonight and tomorrow.  We're all going, by the way.  James, what's going on?  What's up, Owen?  Mano, we think back.  Nice.  She was either Persian broad or an Indian girl who had really hairy arms and a hairy back.  Right at the bottom of her back there.  You guys were cutting into her deep and she was loving it. 
[00:31:00]  She had like an abusive boyfriend or something like that, an overseas foreign dude.  But you guys got to take her pants off and you shaved her right there.  It was one of the classic episodes.  It was great.  Wait, wait.  Where?  It might be the NyQuil talking, Anthony.  It sounds like it.  It might be a little quick on the bell there.  I remember.  We didn't shave her arm hair.  No, no, no.  I think she had really hairy arms and hairy back.  Right at the bottom of her back.  You guys noticed it when she had a shirt off the back.  Right above her butt. 
[00:31:30]  You guys went to town shaving that and then you shaved the whole butt too.  All right.  There was something else about Mono that Stinky reminded me of.  What was it?  No, that was why she came in.  There was a reason why she came in.  It had nothing to do with the hairy butt.  No, she didn't come in for that.  No, but who?  She was talking to you guys about her abusive boyfriend or something overseas, some real whack job.  She was into all wild stuff this broad.  You're missing the key reason she was in here. 
[00:32:00]  All right.  I guess I am.  That was a good one.  I'm telling you.  I got to think.  I got to think.  What?  You guys from the beginning.  What the heck was she there for besides that?  She wasn't there to get shaved.  No.  I think she was dancing for you at one point.  There was a reason?  All right, look.  I think she had monster boobs.  Look at it.  Real monster boobs or something with her boobs.  All right.  You know, this guy's tried real hard.  We got to give it to him.  She came in claiming to have the biggest natural boobs ever.  Come on. 
[00:32:30]  Ain't that it?  You got it.  We're legit, too.  We're going to give it to you.  We're legit.  And, yeah, she was kind of attractive, but she had a hair problem.  Sorry, James.  No, no.  You lose.  I'm sorry.  What?  What?  Yo, hey, I think you're hitting the neck a little too hard.  I just said it.  I got it.  No, no.  No, no.  Don't mind that today.  He's a little out of it.  Good on her, Austin.  Good on her, Austin.  Good on her, Austin.  The neck was a little hard.  All right, Anthony. 
[00:33:00]  This guy wins.  What?  Am I doing a show with Ronald Reagan today?  Holy, yes.  Yeah, she came in because she claimed to have the world's largest natural boobs.  Yeah.  And then we took a look at her, and we noticed that she had some problems.  And she got kind of naked for us.  And we noticed she had a big problem.  And it was like Stinky's first day on the job, wasn't it?  Or close?  Close to it, yeah.  First week or two.  And Stinky, yeah, shaved her you-know-what right here in the studio.  Her ass. 
[00:33:30]  And then we collected the hair, put it in a baggie, put it on the shelf, and it's been  there ever since.  There you go.  So you want some Brewer tickets for Irving Plaza?  I got a new boy at home, six weeks old.  That kid's keeping me up.  I'll take anything you guys want to give me because you're the best.  Just keep on making us laugh.  You know what?  How about a Samsung DVD player?  Awesome.  Because we're feeling nice today.  And the holiday right around the season, you got a young little kid at home.  Why not?  Is that thing bigger or smaller than Ben's CD burner?  Much smaller, Anthony. 
[00:34:00]  And I think this is the one where you can play VCR and DVD.  Oh, that's nice.  Yep.  All right, James, thanks for playing and helping us out.  Thanks, Owen.  Just keep on making us laugh, bro.  We're trying.  You got the Samsung DVD player, right?  Great.  All right, there he goes, James.  We can hang up on everyone else, Mary.  Tell them thanks for playing.  All right.  Anthony?  Yes.  O&A Army, hard at work in Boston.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Glad to see you haven't forgotten.  Thank you. 
[00:34:30]  Anthony, we really got to get our contestants for Mommy.  What would you do for Britney Spears tickets, okay?  Yeah.  Friday is right around the corner now.  We've been a little too tough, I think, with the mommies.  What do you mean tough?  We've heard from hundreds of moms.  Yeah.  We only have one contestant for Friday.  All the other ones, we were like, eh, not good enough.  Yeah.  All right.  We got to be a little easier then.  Well, no, I don't want to be easier because, you know, we got to hold to our O.P. and Anthony  standards, my friend.  So we need women that are going to come in here and do some outrageous thing for their 
[00:35:00]  children to go see Britney Spears.  Right.  We have a pair of tickets for Britney Spears concert Wednesday, December 5th at the Garden.  Tickets courtesy of Jive Records.  Thanks, guys.  Yeah.  Tickets are very good, by the way.  $100 in spending money so you can buy whatever you need to buy.  A T-shirt and whatnot.  Limo to and from the show courtesy of Vital Transportation slash top-notch limo.  Heee!  Heee!  Still promoting two companies, which screws the F out of everybody. 
[00:35:30]  1-800-GO-VITAL.  You see Anthony last time he came in?  Limo Anthony?  Uh-uh.  He sits there and he's all happy to be here and stuff.  He's like, hey, how you guys been?  And by the time he leaves, he's just like, no, I'm going.  He gets all pissed off for no reason.  Because it's all about him.  He's self-centered and he doesn't realize we're doing a radio show.  Yeah.  He thinks he's coming in the studio and we're all at a bar.  And it's like, why aren't they talking to me?  Well, we're trying to, like, entertain people.  Yeah. 
[00:36:00]  Like, I'll be in the middle of doing a read for maybe a stack or two or something.  Right.  He'll just lean right over in the middle of me doing it and go, you think I should get that?  For, uh, not even, like, adding to the spot or anything.  Just right in my ear.  Not even on a microphone.  Does that work?  Should I get that?  Right.  I can't.  It's a show we're doing.  He's such a tool.  Well, he got us a limo for this thing, so.  All right, good.  And we got dinner for two at Paisano's on Mulberry Street.  Thank you, Joe.  Ah, you'll love it.  Go see Joey at Paisano's on Mulberry Street.  Yeah. 
[00:36:30]  So, Mommies, what the hell would you do for the Britney Spears tickets?  We need to know.  We need to get the contestants so we can move on with the show because Brewer's coming in  here today.  What a great prize.  Ron Jeremy's coming in here today.  We have a penthouse pet coming in here today.  Very busy show for this fine Whip-a-Mow Wednesday.  We have one girl.  She was pregnant at 14, had the kid at 15.  The kid is now four years old.  She's 19.  19 years old.  She is coming in.  She's a mom.  She will suck on Stalker Patty's hammer toes. 
[00:37:00]  Her disgusting hammer toes.  You can't even...  Yeah, look.  Mary's freaking out.  Can you imagine, Mary?  You saw those hammer toes.  Oh, yeah.  I saw them up close.  I was the one who filmed them.  They're horrifying.  She's actually going to put her mouth on the foot.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  And Stalker Patty doesn't wash them off.  God, I hope you guys were listening late in the show yesterday because we got an earful  yesterday.  Patty's saying, I don't know why you're making fun of my feet.  I know they're ugly, but I got hematose. 
[00:37:30]  I scrub them in the shower and it hurts and I can't clip my nails because of the pain.  And she's just blah, blah, crying, crying, crying.  And you look at these feet.  I swear to God, her toenails are disgusting.  Well, you described them.  They look like Doritos.  Doritos.  No, no, no.  The Fritos.  The Fritos leg.  Corn chips.  Fritos leg corn chips glued to her toes.  Her disgusting knobby hammer toe.  And her toes, she's got that big bone next to the big toe that sticks out and then 
[00:38:00]  her toe pulls like a severe turn into the other toes.  And then that big talon that she's got on her big toenail.  I can't cut it because it hurts, but I still got good hygiene.  She called up weeping yesterday.  Oh, it was hilarious.  I can't help it if I shut up.  You need to take NyQuil every day.  She disgusts me with that. 
[00:38:30]  Did we even ask Dr. Patty if some stranger could suck on those damn things?  She'll do anything at this point.  That's true.  Patty, jump out a window.  Okay.  So that's the deal.  We have one contestant so far.  No more mommies called.  This girl will do that on Friday and she walks away with the tickets.  But mommies, come on.  You got to get in here.  You got to do something outrageous.  And you'll be going with your little daughter to go see Brittany.  Great seats, limo, dinner, money.  Yeah.  What are you waiting for, ladies?  Hell, we'll throw in the other stuff. 
[00:39:00]  Yeah.  Maybe we'll throw in some of the stuff that we threw away.  Wow.  Steve, what's going on?  Hey, quick question.  I wanted to know if I could trade my 2600 Atari for Ben's Phillips player.  The CD burner?  What did you make that trade, Ben?  What are you going to do with that damn thing?  I'm going to ColecoVision.  He's going to ColecoVision, yeah.  Remember that ColecoVision basketball?  Thanks a lot, guys.  Wasn't that soccer, too?  Yeah, same thing. 
[00:39:30]  Same game.  Just different title.  I'm waiting for some of the mommies call.  This is what sucks about being on a really long delay.  It's a great prize, though, I think.  And you don't have to be that outrageous to beat this woman that wants to suck on Stalker Patty's toes.  Oh, look, Mary's disgusted.  That is not.  What if you want to, if you're a mommy and you say, all right, I'll top that, I will do something else to the toes where it's still going somewhere, yet I'll be able to whistle at the same time. 
[00:40:00]  You know what I mean?  Right.  Oh, we got some pictures of our office up on what?  That's on opiananthony.com.  Opiananthony.com.  You go to Wall of Fame and you go to...  See, your pile doesn't look that bad.  I got to admit, of course it's not that bad.  There you go.  It says Ben and Stinky's pile.  It's mainly mine, but it's not that bad.  All right.  Uh, Fran, you're next to the opianthony show.  Wow.  Hey, guys, how you doing?  Where the hell are you working? 
[00:40:30]  Anthony, I just want to...  Fran, where are you working?  In a sweatshop?  I will never, ever eat Fritos corn chips again.  That is disgusting.  Isn't it?  Oh, it's horrible.  And her feet smell like a bag of corn chips.  Ew.  Fran, I just want...  Where are you working?  I just want to thank you.  Fran, where are you working?  I drive a school bus.  I just pulled over.  Oh.  That's why there's so much noise.  What age are kids?  All right, guys.  It was nice talking to you. 
[00:41:00]  Well, she's not answering.  I don't really feel like I talked to you myself.  I know.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I didn't hear you.  What are the ages of the kids?  Yeah, that you drive around.  Uh, he's only 10 years old.  He?  He?  You drive one kid?  Well, actually, I have three, but two are out.  Oh, you drive the short bus.  Yeah.  Oh, you drive...  And he just corrected me.  He's 11.  He's 11?  Is he got...  Does he got a hockey helmet on?  No, no, no, no, no.  I used to drive people like that, yeah.  Yeah? 
[00:41:30]  With the hockey helmet.  Do you have the sign on the back that says, has been checked for sleeping children?  Oh, yes.  Yep.  Do you ever leave one?  No, no.  Not yet.  All right.  I haven't gotten in trouble yet.  Well, go out and have a bag of Fritos.  No, thank you.  Big stalker patty toenails.  Thanks, Anthony.  Tell him large, large, sent ya.  Yeah.  All right, Fred.  Thanks.  Take it easy, guys.  Bye.  Yeah, she pulls the bus over, grabs a smoke.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, bleh, bleh, bleh, bleh, bleh. 
[00:42:00]  Bleh, bleh, bleh.  Oh, no.  One of the members of the Future Chicken Fighters is calling.  Lenny.  Yes?  Hey, are you really a member of the Future Chicken Farmers?  I absolutely am.  When did you give us that CD?  You know, well, that's one of the issues and one of the reasons I called is because apparently  I was told there was a note on there that said, sorry for the, I don't know what word  was used, but sorry for the poor quality.  Yeah.  Not the poor quality of the music.  Maybe I should have cleared that up.  The poor quality of the tape. 
[00:42:30]  This thing looks like a homemade recording.  Really?  Yeah.  That must be really old.  Wow, is that really, that's the latest picture of our office with all the boos and the cases?  This goes back to May.  Remember in May we took a bunch of photos.  Oh, yeah.  No, see, they got to update those photos.  Collection of boos.  So, Lenny, what do you do for the Future Chicken Fighters?  I play acoustic guitars and we are farmers, not fighters.  We farm, not fight.  Farmers.  Future Chicken.  Oh, they wrote it wrong on the screen.  You're right.  Future Chicken Farmers.  Right.  Farmers.  Where'd you come up with that name? 
[00:43:00]  Well, apparently a couple of years ago, maybe five or six of them,  at this point, they were going to introduce emu as a new form of poultry.  And hence the Future Chicken Farmers.  We were going to be the chicken farmers of the future.  Oh, my God.  Is the music as exciting as that story?  Yeah, why don't you just open up the dictionary and point to a word and call yourself that?  That?  I don't know.  It's kind of, it's a funny name.  It's actually gotten us a lot of interest. 
[00:43:30]  Oh, there you go.  Future Chicken Farmers, funny name.  Yeah.  So what did you call for?  What did I call for?  I guess I kind of called to see why some, you know.  All right.  What's the best song on the CD you sent us?  Or I think it's a tape, even.  It's a tape.  Yeah.  A tape?  You know what?  A CD?  Ben's got a CD burner, for God's sake.  Hold on.  No one can hear us for some reason.  I know.  They keep talking over us.  Why can't people hear?  Can you hear us, Ryan?  Can you hear us, Ryan?  Yeah, but it's kind of low, actually, on the phone. 
[00:44:00]  Someone, why are people effing with our buttons?  Just leave them where they are.  See?  They're all labeled nice.  Go to the yellow mark, and we can all hear each other.  Can you hear us better?  Yes.  Of course you can, because that's where it's supposed to be.  People are talking over us.  But people know better, obviously, than Pete Johnson.  Pete Johnson.  Expert engineer.  Yes.  Jesus.  I can engineer a shuttle launch.  Lenny.  Yes.  Where's Stinky?  Stinky!  Stinky.  Stinky.  So, what's on this tape? 
[00:44:30]  Do you have the tape there?  You don't even know what songs are on your tape, and you don't know who Stinky is?  I couldn't estimate what's on there, because we haven't sent out cassettes in about five  years.  Five years.  We're on TV at this point.  We've only been here three years, my friend.  Really?  So, it must have been sent out.  Stinky, do you know when we got that tape from the future chicken farmer guy?  That could have been sitting in there from back when that was Gary Wall's office, when he  was the program director of the station.  It's very likely. 
[00:45:00]  Like I said, we've been on CD for about four years at this point.  Wow, look at you.  How about that?  But I think it did say O&A.  It did say O&A on it.  All right.  Name a song off the cassette you sent us.  Seed Your Clouds.  What?  Seed Your Clouds.  Seed Your?  Seed Your Clouds.  Seed Your Clouds.  Huh.  Hey, Stink, you've got to find that cassette.  Find that cassette.  Now I'm curious.  See, Opie, this is why there's a problem with cleaning the office. 
[00:45:30]  But if I didn't bring this up today, we would have never heard of it.  We would have never gotten to talk to the guitarist from Future Chicken Farmers.  That is correct.  Future Chicken Farmers.  So, you're gigging?  Yeah, we've been gigging all around the city.  We've actually been working on two new albums at this point as well.  Oh, two at once?  Yes.  We're going to release them both at the same time.  We had a surplus of songs.  What label are you on?  Actually, we run our own label called Big Head Records.  Big Head.  I've heard of this. 
[00:46:00]  Yeah.  Big Head Records.  We saw one of those.  Never mind.  All right.  He's got his own record company there, too.  All right.  I think he's going to find your cassette.  You want to hold on?  Absolutely.  All right.  And we'll get one of your songs on the air.  Just a little piece, my friend.  That's fine.  You've never heard of Sushi Records?  Sushi Records?  Yeah, that was the one my brother had.  Really?  That was what Rotgut was on, Opie.  Sushi Records.  A little trivia for the people out there.  Maybe a future contest.  Sushi Records. 
[00:46:30]  Sushi Records.  Yes.  So, everyone's got their own little record company when you're a band.  That is correct.  And you're not signed.  Right.  Lenny, hold on, okay?  Absolutely.  All right, Ann.  We've got to take a break.  Jim Brewer will be here very soon.  Ron Jeremy, very soon.  Penthouse pet, very soon.  Also, Mommies, you've got to call.  Now Stalker Patty's...  Oh, my God.  Patty.  Hi.  How are you?  Hi.  I don't want to disappoint that girl on Friday, but I begged and pleaded my friends in Princeton  to let me work a few hours so that I could pay my rent this week. 
[00:47:00]  And I was put as an extra on the schedule for the closing in Princeton.  Where?  What a closing.  I could dive?  Where?  No.  Where?  In Princeton at my friend's store in the market there.  How much money is he going to...  Well, I'm going to be short about $50, so he's going to allow me to make it then.  So, you're going to make $50?  Yeah, but if I don't do that, I'm going to...  I have a new landlord now, and I moved again, and I have to pay him... 
[00:47:30]  I don't care!  God, there's always a sad story.  How come she can't...  She works two jobs, and she can't pay her rent in her hovel.  Let's ask her.  She can't pay...  Talk to Patty.  Hey, my rent is...  Patty, she was still talking.  We had you on hold, you stupid Patty.  I'm not stupid.  I'm sorry.  Patty, Patty, listen to me.  Yes?  You work two jobs at least, correct?  No, not anymore.  I'm not at McDonald's.  You're not at McDonald's anymore?  No, I have one job, and I didn't get five days until just this week. 
[00:48:00]  Why aren't you at McDonald's anymore?  I was there two and a half years, and I just wasn't happy there.  Because, you know...  Wasn't that...  Why would you...  You're on the schedule to three, and they send you home at 11 because it's slow.  It doesn't pay your rent.  Patty, Patty, why did you leave a job when you still can't afford your rent?  Well, because I wasn't making anything there. 
[00:48:30]  Now you're making less because you're not working at all.  Why didn't you find another job?  Well, yes, I am working.  When they send you home early, you can then go and find a job.  Yeah, but I already have my one job now.  I'm working five days.  And it's not enough to pay your rent?  Well, no, this is the first week I'm actually working five days.  I won't see that check until next week.  All right, hold on a minute, all right?  Why don't you put your feet in a sideshow?  And I have to discuss something.  Hold on.  We're going to have to come over with 50 bucks.  I'm telling you.  If we pull our resources, it's fine. 
[00:49:00]  It's not even, you know, what is it, 25 bucks each if we both do it?  Patty.  Yeah?  We'll pay the 50 bucks because we need you for Friday.  I can't believe I'm saying this.  We'll pay you your 50.  This is how pathetic our stupid contest has become.  Now, we're paying Stalker Patty to come down here Friday.  Mommy, for the love of God, call us and tell us what we'll do.  Yeah, what are you doing?  For the Britney Spears tickets.  Don't worry, it doesn't have to be a whole porno thing.  Just something creative and fun.  Patty, if we cover the 50, will you come down Friday?  Okay, sure. 
[00:49:30]  Sure.  Well, yeah.  All right.  Well, this 19-year-old girl from Long Island is going to suck on your hammer toes, though.  Will that cause you pain?  I don't know.  I hope she bites it and it cracks like a walnut.  We might as well get you the pedicure while you're down there.  Yeah, set up the pedicure.  Oh, all right.  But she's got to do the pedicure after the girl sucks on him.  Okay.  All right.  All righty.  All right, hold on, Patty.  Okay. 
[00:50:00]  Well, Patty's coming down.  Now we've got to find someone that's going to give her a pedicure as well.  Might as well kill two birds with one freaking stone.  All right, Anthony, Stinky's went to look for the Future Chicken Farmer CD.  Yeah.  When we get back from break, we'll see what that was about because we have Lenny on the phone.  Good, good.  One of the many things we threw away from our office, so now Stinky's digging it out of the garbage.  Now there's complaints being phoned in for the stuff we're throwing away.  Newberry Comics complaining because they said, hey, guys, you're throwing away the stuff we just sent you Monday. 
[00:50:30]  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  What was the one thing?  M&M.  The M&M and the motion-activated farm alarm, a fart alarm, came in Monday.  We threw it away today, Wednesday.  So they're pissed at us.  Yeah.  And now we've got the future chicken farmers all pissed at us.  Earl, yes.  Did you measure the office, Earl?  Yes.  And?  21 by 15.  Oh, it is bigger than 18.  Wow.  Okay. 
[00:51:00]  It's a nice-sized office.  Thank you, Earl.  Quick break.  It took how long?  An hour.  An hour to get two measurements.  I didn't know about it until like 20 minutes ago.  I was upstairs.  We asked to have the office measured an hour ago.  I did nothing about this.  Right at the top of the show.  We got into this discussion.  I was upstairs.  I didn't even hear it.  It took an hour for you to measure the goddamn office, Earl.  It did not take me an hour to measure.  I didn't even know about it until 20 minutes ago. 
[00:51:30]  Earl, I didn't know what 20 minutes ago.  Oh, my God.  He's throwing things.  Oh, my God.  Oh, he's out there swearing.  I didn't know.  I swear to God.  20 minutes ago, I hopped in my DeLorean time machine.  I went back 20 minutes ago, and then I found out.  Ben, you're a sick F.  You set him off.  I swear to God, I know you, man.  You didn't tell him until 20 minutes ago, knowing we would bust on him.  I got to call Ben out on this one, man.  He's breaking the foosball table.  No way.  He didn't break the foosball table.  He did. 
[00:52:00]  Oh, my.  He's throwing cards.  Ben.  Oh, my dear, sweet Jesus.  Ben, you're a sick F.  Ben set him off.  What did he do to the foosball table?  Ben set him off.  Ben, I got to call you out on this.  I didn't set him off.  Did it fall over?  No.  Oh, my God.  I almost did that.  Holy Jesus.  If he breaks that foosball table.  It almost fell over.  I think something's up with the leg.  The whole thing just was tipping up and down and back and forth.  You know, he should put that much energy into his work day.  His little tirades.  I guarantee Ben told him to measure the office five minutes ago. 
[00:52:30]  I heard when he ran out just now, he was throwing around a Samsonite bag.  Is that true?  No?  No, it's not true.  Okay, I heard that.  Drink some more NyQuil.  What else did you bring?  No, you can see on the ground.  You can see the circles where the foosball table was.  It's going to be all on level now.  All right, listen.  We've got to take a break because I see our pal outside the studio, Jim Brewer, has arrived.  Mommy, you have to call and help us out.  Friday is the big show with Mommy, What Would You Do for Britney Spears tickets. 
[00:53:00]  Tell us what you would do for the tickets, a limo ride, spending money, free dinner, okay?  Call us up, Mommy.  You've got to call us now.  There's a car with a round next to me.  Whip out your cans.  Pull out your fun bags.  What are you waiting for?  Do it.  Do it now.  What are you waiting?  You look fabulous.  Opie and Anthony.  We love seeing boobs.  Well, duh.

And we're back with the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:54:30]  Crystal Method, yo.  Name of the game from Tweekend.  I was working out for that CD last night at New York Sports Clubs, Anthony.  Gets me moving when I'm on that treadmill.  Jim Brewer is around here somewhere.  I think he had to go to Club Stinky.  Yeah, I saw Stinky call in a reservation.  He's very big in the organization.  That way he could bypass the line, the velvet rope, and get right into Club Stinky with Brewer and hang out. 
[00:55:00]  I wonder where Brewer's going to sign the wall.  Oh, he's got to sign the wall.  Of course he does.  Let's go to Lenny again.  Lenny.  Yes.  All right, we found your CD.  Okay, great.  The CD we threw away about an hour and a half ago.  Excellent.  We're talking to one of the guys from Future Chicken Farmers.  Uh-huh.  That's correct.  And he called up because he heard that we threw his CD away, and he's really, really pissed off.  Yeah, Seed Your Clouds is on this CD.  All right.  It is a CD. 
[00:55:30]  It is a CD.  Well, there's a cassette here, too.  Oh, okay.  That has a song called Poke.  Right.  What is that?  That is a song about essentially getting drunk and kind of doing things you shouldn't be doing with people you shouldn't be doing them with.  Oh, very good.  You know, with an explanation like that, I can't understand why the majors aren't calling you at this point.  The major labels, my friend.  Let me see that, Opie.  Uh, this?  Yeah.  Sure.  Let me take that one.  So, Seed Your Clouds. 
[00:56:00]  Yeah, you can play that one, and that should be, it's, I think it's listed as song one, but it's actually song two.  Oh, because there's an intro, right?  Right, because there's an intro, and somehow when they pressed the CD, everything ended up a song ahead.  Oh.  A song off.  How pissed were you?  Interesting.  Um, not happy.  Definitely not happy.  Well, Anthony, would you like to hear a little piece of Seed Your Clouds?  Yeah.  Listen, uh, we're going to, what we're going to do now is we got, uh, what's your name?  Lenny?  Yes.  Yes, sir. 
[00:56:30]  The intro sucks.  Yeah, the intro's terrible.  Why would you put that on your CD?  I don't know.  It wasn't my choice.  The first thing they hear.  It wasn't my choice.  The first thing they hear is, uh, a really, really bad quality of you guys talking about the song they're about to hear, right?  Yeah, something like that, something really ridiculous that I don't know how it made it to CD.  I really had no involvement on that.  Um.  All right, shut up.  The future chicken farmers.  Did you book this act?  No, I wish I did.  He booked this act.  Yes, he did.  Who's that talking? 
[00:57:00]  That's, that's someone, uh, you know what?  I believe that is, um, someone from a cable access show.  Uh-huh.  Which makes it even more of a mystery of why it's there.  You guys were so proud that you were on a cable access show.  You decided that it needs to be on the CD.  Apparently someone was.  Ah.  What's that name, Bobby?  No, it's not me.  The future chicken farmers.  Definitely someone else.  The future chicken farmers.  Ain't that a bitch?  Yeah.  All right, here's Senior Clouds.  All right.  Thank you.  Ah, here you go. 
[00:57:30]  Getting some national, uh, airplay here.  And it, let me keep...  Shut up!  All right.  All right.  You almost threw this away, I hope.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Uh, Lenny, when does the singing start? 
[00:58:00]  Um, a couple of, uh, probably about 40 seconds into it.  Yeah, it's like a, uh, an intro open.  Yeah.  Ugh.  Yeah.  I'm a joke song as a lost I've seen.  My scared that's lying there to be a girl.  And if you put a phone call, you're a touch, you kiss my hand.  Yeah.  Um, Lenny?  Your singer likes that chorus echo, huh?  Yeah, there's a little bit of echo on there.  Yeah.  Yeah, Lenny, I haven't been able to recognize one word yet in the vocals. 
[00:58:30]  Yeah, the vocals are a little low.  A little muddy.  Yeah.  Hopi, you know what chorus echo is used for also?  Lenny, do you know?  What's that?  What chorus echo is used for?  No.  It's when a singer really isn't hitting the notes.  Right.  Right on the money, so they throw that in and it kind of covers it up.  There you go.  All right.  Oh, thanks, Ben.  Oh, Ben.  Now I've got to start the whole goddamn song on.  We were using that CD, Ben. 
[00:59:00]  Maybe go for one later in the CD.  Oh, later in the CD.  Maybe they got the mix better.  Later.  Oh, now we've got to start the song over again.  Thanks, Ben.  You can blame Ben for this one, everyone.  Why do we have to start it over again?  Just to annoy people.  You're still with the band, Lenny?  Absolutely.  And it's still the original lineup that we hear on this CD?  Actually, our bass player has left and gone to Oregon.  Oregon.  We are now over.  The state or another band?  What's that?  Why did he go to Oregon? 
[00:59:30]  Essentially, his wife wanted to move there.  Ah, that old story.  So, what is he doing instead of hoping to make it with the future chicken farmers?  Probably right now he's sitting in his living room.  You don't even know?  You don't keep in touch?  No, I kept in touch.  The only news I've gotten is he bought a couch.  Well, there you go.  Yeah.  So, I don't think he's been up to all that much.  You know, Alpi, I would have given my eye teeth for this opportunity when I was with  Rotgut for a station to just play my song in 15 cities like this. 
[01:00:00]  Lenny, do you understand this opportunity you're getting right now?  Absolutely.  I'll give a little plug.  People can find us on mp3.com backslash fcf.  What do you have backslash in your website title?  Well, it's mp3.com and that'll bring you right to our page if you put the backslash fcf.  Don from East Meadow wants to know, does your drummer have a pancreas?  You know, I haven't checked lately, but last time he did.  Just checking. 
[01:00:30]  There's another one for New York.  Okay, here we go.  Here we go.  Seed the clouds.  Vocals come at any second now.  Or seed your clouds.  All the lights are lighting up at this point, huh?  Is it the lighters song there?  I'm a joke, so I was a lot of sleep.  I'm scared that's lying there, so pain I'm gonna be.  If you put the phone on top of your 20s, it's not a pancreas.  Yeah. 
[01:01:00]  Venture people.  Dozens of a sudden severe and they get got the conversation on Sunday.  I'm trying to understand that.  My sky has always been a way to set up the phone.  All right.  Hey, where's the chorus?  Um, that was a chorus.  Right before that.  That was the chorus.  Okay.  All right.  I go on on Friday.  All right.  That was good.  Lenny, I swear to you, I'm not trying to make a radio thing. 
[01:01:30]  I really don't understand the vocals.  I don't know what he's singing about.  I can't understand them.  There is a lyric sheet.  Sounds like Chris Robinson getting his nads chewed off by a wildebeest.  But when you bought...  Here.  Let's see.  You hear what he said, man?  He goes, there's a lyric sheet.  Yeah, yeah.  But when you buy a CD, you don't want to have to read the lyrics because you can't hear them.  Right?  Absolutely.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  Let's go for something later in the CD. 
[01:02:00]  People are yelling for Fozzy.  But here, Anthony, can I read some of the words of Senior Clouds?  All right.  Well, this is what we just heard.  I'm a jigsaw puzzle autopsy.  See, now that would be great if it was ACDZ.  I'm a jigsaw puzzle.  I'll let my singer know he should sing in his Bon Scott voice for the next album.  My stray pasts lie in mental penal colonies.  Oh, he's went deep, didn't he? 
[01:02:30]  All you telephone profiteer psychics can kiss my ass.  All right.  I praise chaos and entropy.  Four courses of absurdist severity.  I got condensation of surreal truths in my looking glass.  Holy ass.  What kind of throw for you guys' cake?  Alex from Cleveland is getting your name wrong, Alex.  No, it's not the future chicken effers, which he's calling them.  That happens often.  The second verse. 
[01:03:00]  Today I feel like the son of God.  Every face I see looks on the nod.  All on overload of death as entertainment, you meet the best connections stuck in a rehab.  I'm not pointing fingers.  We've all been fed from a glad bag.  We all come into this world with our own derangements.  That's sick.  And my sky has always been a wicked shade of purple, and I can open it up and make it rain all over you.  I try to grow closer to my chai.  I go surfing the universe for anarchy, and I got no uses for the latest chromium no-stick gizmo. 
[01:03:30]  Holy ass.  Dude.  Opie, I'm getting pictures right now from the website of these guys.  Let me see.  Nice.  All right, which one are you?  What picture are you looking for?  I'm looking at a black and white picture with a guy sitting in a bathtub.  Actually, you know what?  I'm not in that picture.  Why aren't you in the picture?  You're not with the future chicken farmers, are you? 
[01:04:00]  Yes, I am.  Are you on mp3.com?  Are you the roadie for the band?  No, I am the acoustic guitar player.  Are you on the mp3.com page?  No, I'm on some hometown AOL.com.  Oh, yeah.  There's a whole page for me on that.  Hey, you don't get a credit in this song, by the way.  If you go to band photos on that.  Russell got a credit.  Adam got a credit.  Tim got a credit.  Yeah.  And Peaceful Giant got a credit.  Play the song Spawning Ground.  All right, hold on. 
[01:04:30]  Well, that's it.  Can I read the rest of these lyrics?  I'm just about done, Anthony.  Absolutely.  I function fine on nonlinear time.  You never had the stomach for bloody crime.  Go hide by yourself draining bottles of Pepto-Bismol.  And my sky has always been a wicked shade of purple,  and I can open it up and make it rain all over you.  There you go.  All right, what track do you want to see?  That was a nice reading.  Spawning Ground.  And remember, it's going to be one off.  One off.  From what it says.  One ahead.  Okay, so Spawning Ground on the CD says six,  which means it's actually track seven. 
[01:05:00]  Absolutely.  Are you?  Just to make it extra confusing.  This is going to be the press conference up there.  Now, when you listen to the CD.  Are you Luscious Lenny?  That is correct.  Luscious Lenny.  We're talking to Luscious Lenny, Anthony.  Luscious Lenny.  And that's your picture of you in the suit?  Yep.  And if you could, again, on the band page,  there's a link to my own little page there.  Dude, you'd make me nervous at an airport.  I'm just saying.  Hey, I want to point something out.  There's a track on the CD called 9-8. 
[01:05:30]  Yes.  Could you imagine if it was 9-11?  Wow.  You would have got some press, my friend.  That would be eerie.  Three days off, and you would have got some press there.  Spawning Ground.  Yes.  Okay, let's take a little listen to this, Anthony.  Are we listening to Tim Hitchcock on vocals?  Yes, that is correct.  All right.  The Tim Hitchcock.  Oh, yeah.  The Tim Hitchcock, Anthony.  Future Chicken Farmers, this is Spawning Ground.  All right.  That's the chorus, really.  We're talking.  Is that you on guitar? 
[01:06:00]  Yeah, I'm playing the acoustic guitar.  Oh, there you go.  Very nice.  Luscious Lenny.  I thought maybe it would have come in there.  Who's playing the woodblock?  That is someone named Peaceful John.  And if you notice, the production is much different here.  Memories of the ancestral world. 
[01:06:30]  John DeSharp.  Vicious paintings.  Of thoughts I should have trashed.  Hey, Lenny.  Yes, sir.  You do realize Tim is mediocre at best.  Right?  Like, it's very mediocre.  I like this better when it was called Extreme.  Oh, no. 
[01:07:00]  Where did I send you guys a copy of our new CD?  Does the chorus kick in?  Where's the chorus?  Here it is.  Right now.  Right here.  Right here.  Right here.  Now there's moon dust in my eye rails.  She's my psycho troll.  Like, it's very thin.  Hold on.  He's almost done with the chorus.  I'm taking the spawning ground with new bell drums.  Breathing low will make me alive. 
[01:07:30]  That's kind of mellow.  It's, you know.  All right.  Well, all right.  Okay, sure.  Spawning grounds.  With the mediocre Tim Hitchcock.  Well, you know.  I'm digging Lenny's playing, though.  I think so, man.  Thank you.  I like Lenny's guitar.  That's what I'm saying.  I want to send you guys copies of our new stuff.  Sure.  Why not?  Where would I do that?  Where would I send this to?  Oh, wow.  All right.  Well, sure.  I guess we could give you an address. 
[01:08:00]  Is Skeezer the guy that left?  Yes.  Skeezer is the one who left.  He's sitting on his new couch in Oregon.  That's absolutely right.  And who's your new bass player?  At this point, we have someone named Alex who is playing with us.  Alex.  Alex the bass player.  All right.  Okay, spawning ground.  I just want to read a few of the lyrics really fast.  That way you might have missed them.  Psychic imprints.  Memories of the ancestral world.  Vicious paintings.  Who writes the songs, Lenny? 
[01:08:30]  That would be Tim.  Tim.  Tim Hitchcock.  Oh, we got it.  Lenny got a credit on this song, Anthony.  Acoustic guitar, Lenny.  That's right.  Okay, so memories of the ancestral world.  Vicious paintings.  Thoughts I should have trash, but I'm no longer embarrassed.  But my mind's stranger acquisitions.  Acquisitions.  Acquisitions.  Well, there's coffee stains on this, so I'm throwing it away.  I'm sorry.  Yeah, it was in the garbage, remember, Lenny.  Because there's some of the few things in this lifetime that seem to last. 
[01:09:00]  Now there's Moondust in my iris.  She's my psychotrope.  What's a psychotrope?  That's like a drug that changes your mind, like Prozac or something.  Oh, there you go.  All right.  I dig this spawning ground with new vengeance.  Breeding love, it makes me rise.  Wow, that's great stuff.  Okay.  That's something.  All right, Lenny.  You rescued your CD from the garbage pail, Lenny, and look at where it got you.  Yeah, absolutely.  Who saw that coming?  No one, not me. 
[01:09:30]  I didn't think you guys would dumps to die for it.  I'm actually quite impressed.  Yeah, I think we'll keep it on file here.  And as I said, I definitely would like to send you guys some new stuff.  You do that.  So you can see how we've progressed.  I'm looking forward to see how the music has progressed.  Sure.  Opie, are you filing?  Yeah, no, Anthony, I think.  Put it in a safe place.  I think the band has a future.  All right.  I really do.  Well, future chicken farmer.  Yeah, that's the first one.  Again, that was recorded about four years ago, and as you guys noticed, I wasn't even 
[01:10:00]  really in the band at the time.  Lenny?  Yes, sir.  A little word of advice.  It says on this CD, EP.  Mm-hmm.  There's 30 tracks on your CD.  How could it be an EP?  An EP.  Because even with all those tracks, it comes out to about a half hour.  That's it?  Oh, you know what?  There's the hidden track.  That's why it says 30.  Oh.  And that's the hidden track.  What's the hidden track?  The hidden track is poke.  Poke?  P-O-K-E?  Yeah.  Alternate names from the group. 
[01:10:30]  This is Tommy Mack from South Jersey checking in.  Future squeegee guys.  He also has future KFC chicken drive-thru guys.  And future AA members.  I think that's already there.  Yeah, what's the future about that?  Libby from Chantilly, Virginia wants us to stop rocking the chair because we keep hitting  the cat's tail over the music.  Anthony, I need to put this aside here. 
[01:11:00]  He might have had some friends.  All right.  Well, Lenny, thank you.  Okay.  We'll put this one aside and we're eagerly looking for your next CD.  And once again, people can find us on mp3.com backslash FCF.  What, Lenny?  You got a guest book there?  What's that?  You got a guest book there?  I don't know if there's a guest book, actually.  Well, email address or something?  My email address is L-E-N-N-Y-M-O-N-T-A-L-T-O at hotmail.com. 
[01:11:30]  And we're available for weddings, bar mitzvahs, the whole spiel.  Well, the CD's been put away.  And we'll look for your next one.  All right.  Where should I send it, guys?  Ah, well, we'll put you on hold.  Yeah, you hold on.  We'll get you the address.  Thank you.  All right.  Hold on.  There's Lenny from the Future Chicken Farmers.  He might have had one friend try to help him out.  Huh?  Dude, don't send it, man.  Dude. 
[01:12:00]  Dude, as a friend.  I'm just telling you as a friend.  Don't send it.  You know what the funniest thing is?  Don't call in.  Wait, can we pick up Lenny?  Let's pick up Lenny outside.  Let's pick up Lenny.  Oh, yeah.  Pick up Lenny outside.  Rick, make sure you get him the address.  There he goes.  Oh, he's here?  Picking him up.  No.  Dude.  Nice head.  I just came down to Paracel.  Okay, he can't hear us anymore.  Hi.  Three plus words.  Let's go, Mets.  Mookie.  Why we would care if he heard us or not, I really don't understand. 
[01:12:30]  But he is now, he can't hear us.  No.  Chris on line four.  It's easier to understand, yes.  Brewer, man.  You've been in that situation, though.  Guys with the bands and stuff.  And it's, they're making all these same exact, like, mistakes that all the bands that just  don't make it make.  They just hang out.  They're hanging out.  They're buds or whatever.  But, you know, the singer isn't that good. 
[01:13:00]  The music's very mediocre.  The bass is trying to bang the lead singer.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  There's probably behind the scenes stuff going on.  And, you know, yeah, we're putting out another album.  No, you're not.  You're making tape.  You're making tapes.  He's at February.  Now you can burn a CD.  You can burn CDs now, so it's different.  But you're not putting out a CD.  You're not putting out an album.  You're recording stuff at home.  Under, I was like, what label you on?  Well, I got a label, too.  I got a label.  He's a guy hanging out in those, like, little dirt bags.  Yeah. 
[01:13:30]  And elements.  Well, as long as you're having fun.  I just, it reminds me too much of just the hell.  Dude, we're playing tonight, but we got to bring six people.  Help us out.  Dude, we got to bring people, man.  When you go down, tell him you're coming to see us, because we don't get paid.  Don't show him the band after us, because he's dicks, and they get the door.  Guy from that band after us, the bass player stole my equipment once, like, five years ago.  I didn't see him, but I know he did it.  Kick his ass.  It's just a living hell.  It is.  Pump your equipment. 
[01:14:00]  Ugh.  And you're not going to get anywhere.  Like, someone like Godsmack, you know?  You just knew they were going to make it.  They had the sound, man.  You heard that demo, and it was like, goddamn, man, this kicks ass.  You know, these guys, it's like, ugh, goddamn, why bother?  But they think they're ready for it.  I know, and that's the sad part.  We're better than Stone Temple Pilots, bro.  Oh, jeez.  We're better than all these faggot bands. 
[01:14:30]  All that, Godsmack, all that.  We'll take them down.  And they're always right on the verge of being signed.  Dude, let me tell you something.  I spoke to a guy that knows a guy that used to work at Atlantic.  Well, check this out.  You know Rat was in town last week, right?  Yeah.  Well, my friend is totally hanging out with the lead singer.  Get out of here.  Yeah, he gets high with him and everything.  Don't tell anyone, because he's supposed to be, you know, clean.  Hey, Brewer really is carrying on a conversation.  He's cursing.  He's cursing.  All right, we've got to take a break. 
[01:15:00]  Yeah, look, it's getting late now.  All right, Brewer has made it back from Club Stinky.  We'll talk to him next week.  Yeah.  He's got a big show tonight and tomorrow night at Irving Plaza.  A bunch of us are going down.  We can't wait.  A few tickets still remain, by the way.  Not many, I don't think.  Yeah.  Might even be sold out at this point.  I don't know, Brewer.  I doubt it.  You doubt it, huh?  I don't think so.  All right.  We'll call Irving Plaza or whatever.  We'll be back.  Stay there.  Whip them out Wednesday.  Oh, man.  One day to go.  Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow. 
[01:15:30]  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  I love that.  The O.P. and Anthony.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  1027 WNEW.  You're checking out the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Our buddy, our pal Jim Brewer in the studio playing Irving Plaza tonight and tomorrow night.  Stone Temple Pilots there.  And Brewer had a run in with STP.  Yeah.  I did.  Apparently, they saw American Dummy. 
[01:16:00]  And it became a fine, fine little independent film that you were in with Otto and George and  Norton.  Jim Norton.  Norton was very...  Louis Black.  Louis Black was funny.  Otto and George.  Otto and George.  Very funny.  Did a little short film for them.  Stone Temple Pilots invited me to the show.  And I thought, you know, hey, half-baked and whatever.  Hey, you're the guy from...  You're the goat guy.  Whatever. 
[01:16:30]  So I show up.  I'm already tired.  It's 10 o'clock.  Then I go on until like 11.  They're re-incited.  They were just excited because I was the guy from this dopey movie.  King of Canarsie.  They're going, Tony Metropolis.  King of Canarsie.  Tony Metropolis.  Scott Weiland going, yo, dude, funny.  Funny.  I am, I am a man.  I said I want to get...  And they were pissed off because I didn't bring Otto. 
[01:17:00]  Really?  Yeah, like, where's the puppy guy?  So they're checking out the flick on the road?  Yeah, it became like a huge cult film with him.  A lot of people are enjoying that damn thing.  No one knows where to get it, but...  Go to my website.  Jim Brewer.com.  There you go.  And you get American Dummy.  I don't know.  I don't think they would want Otto and George sitting there.  George tends to say some stuff.  You have to be 18 and over.  And George tends to say stuff that maybe STP wouldn't want to hear.  How's the dope, vocal boy? 
[01:17:30]  Brewer relaxes.  Pull the needle out of your arm and shut up.  And then Otto, stop it, George.  It's STP.  George, come on.  They've got great hits.  This is great.  I love their songs.  Shut up.  You don't know anything.  Get in the coffin.  Die, die.  You ever see a black...  I love the second album.  Yeah, that's great.  Hey, Wyvern, you're going to smack your wife?  Get in the coffin. 
[01:18:00]  Die, die.  Shut up, you whore.  Oh, man.  Hey, Stephen Baldwin's on the line.  Mr. Baldwin.  Hey, how you doing, fellas?  What?  This guy's been following me around.  What's up, Steve?  What are you doing?  Jim, I wanted to wait until ONA so I could tell the world I'm really in love with you.  Wow, this is going to be great. 
[01:18:30]  I'm the only sober one today.  Are you effed up?  Ed is seeing tracers today from all the night before he's taking it.  I'm on medication or something.  I hung out with Stonky.  I've had some Sam Adams.  Stonky?  Stonky.  Nice head.  You went to Club Stinky.  Give me a nice.  Nice.  Smoked some Stinky's best.  And you were hanging at Club Stinky, yes.  And now, Stephen Baldwin, what are you up to, bro?  Hey, what's the name of this place? 
[01:19:00]  Club Stinky.  What's the name of your place?  Club Stinky.  Shoe Repair.  Your shoe repair on West 40th Street.  I'm here getting my shoe shined at the shoe repair on West 40th Street.  Oh, yeah?  You're getting your shoe shined.  Yeah, my clogs.  All right.  I'm wearing clogs.  All right, Jim, I'll see you tonight, doggy.  I'm actually sitting over there right now, so I'll see you.  How long are you staying there?  What's up, Jim? 
[01:19:30]  Jim?  Yeah.  What are you, snapping it?  What are you doing?  Bro, what is it?  I'll see you later.  What time?  I'm coming over there right now to do this thing else.  Wear your thong.  What time are you staying there until, bro?  I'm staying here until I hang out.  I hang out with these guys.  Oh, I'm coming over there, damn it.  Well, have fun.  I love you, man.  Nice head. 
[01:20:00]  What is that about?  This is getting creepy.  What is going on with that guy?  It just got creepy for me.  Why?  All right, check this out.  Oh, my God.  This dude, he wants...  Hold on, kids.  Hold on.  Have you seen him naked?  Well, can I preface...  That just scared me.  Steve, if you're there, please call back.  You just scared me.  Now I'm thinking, it's like, he really is gay, and he's stalking me.  All right, listen.  I got to preface this.  Because Brewer's in another place today.  He walked in while we were talking to the guitar player from that band, and he was convinced 
[01:20:30]  that we were talking to terrorists.  He was a terrorist.  And then we opened up the CD, and the anthrax went all over the studio.  Brewer had to leave the studio.  He was freaking out.  Well, Ant sits there, and he puts out, and the lead singer, when you look at him, he looks  like a guy that, you know, he's talking to you, going, listen to the second lyrics.  He's like...  Camels are in the back.  So this dude is hanging out, and he's sitting there going, these dumb bastards just opened 
[01:21:00]  up without the anthrax.  Now they read the lyrics.  So you had to leave.  Yeah, well, I didn't leave, but you saw me.  You walked.  You said, I'm going to go to the bathroom.  And now Stephen Baldwin is gay for you.  Well, I didn't know until Oaches kind of said that, or one of you guys said, now I'm  thinking about it.  Huh.  Why?  He's always like hanging out with you.  Well, we did...  I'm in Jersey, and I did this little gig last night, one of them cash gigs.  You're like, hey, man, put me in your bar, charge X amount of dollars, we'll just hang 
[01:21:30]  out and make some cash.  So I went there, did a gig, and in the morning went to this Jersey station.  Don't have to mention, it's out there.  Steve comes, and he's like, dude, dude, we're just going to hang out.  We came on, he comes on the station, he's chasing everyone around.  And today, he's like, listen, man, you know Ron and Fez?  I go, yeah, Bennington, he's an old-time friend of mine.  Actually, I starred at his comedy club many years ago.  Yeah, Ron and Fez on after us here in New York. 
[01:22:00]  Absolutely.  So I was like, yeah, yeah, funny guys, funny guys.  So long story short, he wants to do, he's been talking about...  Hold on, he's back.  Oh, oh.  Stephen.  Stephen!  Let me tell you about the you-know-what.  Rinds with N, ends with S.  You listen up.  Stephen, what are you doing?  Who's calling?  Stephen.  Yeah.  Are you out of your mind today, too?  No, dude, it's, you know, Satan's rampant here in New York City, man. 
[01:22:30]  That's what's going down.  Satan's what?  Rampant.  Running around.  Running around rampant.  Satan.  Satan.  So you're running away from Satan today.  Yeah, I'm on my way over to the safety of O&A.  Holy Jesus.  The sanctuary that is O&A. 
[01:23:00]  Oh, my God.  Satan has dressed as Steve.  Steve Baldwin.  I need to smoke something so I can understand what that is.  Steve, are you all right, man?  What's wrong with you?  Are you all right?  I don't know.  A taxi hit me for a minute, but it seemed like everything was fine.  Where are you guys?  What's the address over there?  7-7 and what's the cross street?  57.  Hi, miss.  How are you?  Seriously, can you do me a favor? 
[01:23:30]  Come here for a second.  I'm on the radio with Opie and Anthony.  You know those guys?  Just say hi to the guys.  Say hi.  Hi.  Hi.  Who are you?  Yeah, what's your name?  Joanne.  Say hi, Joanne.  She's running away right now.  That's going to pick a card out of the sky.  All right, Vera, Steven.  You're coming by?  Yeah.  I just needed to know the cross street, fellas.  All right.  We'll see you in a little bit then.  Thank you.  All right. 
[01:24:00]  Bye.  What's the deal, bro?  What's going on here?  So he was talking about, yo, ma'am, you're funny on the radio.  I go, yeah.  He goes, you know, I'm funny on the radio.  I go, okay.  He said, ma'am, we should do some stuff.  Immediately I said, well, it would take a lot for me to do a radio.  Full-time job.  I said, I love bopping in, showing up a day, do what you got to do, and then you take off.  You go to your home life, you go to a TV show, you do a film, whatever. 
[01:24:30]  You're talking every day.  That's serious.  It becomes a grind.  Absolutely.  It becomes a grind after a while.  So I go, what time are you talking about?  He's all hopped up.  Yeah.  Dude, any time, we'll rock these guys.  I said, let me tell you something.  First rule, if it ever came down to something, and they offered $20 million or some retarded  thing so I could live in Jersey, first is first. 
[01:25:00]  Don't dare, don't dare be against or anything around Opie and Anthony.  Oh.  All right, bro.  He says, well, he's uneducated.  He was talking some Al Quaida.  Yeah.  We'll get two guys, and we drive into the NWO.  I said, dude, listen to me. 
[01:25:30]  He goes, no, no, no, business, business, business, business, business, business, business, business.  I go, first of all, and this is what I honestly said.  Yeah.  I'm not sunken, touching donkey-donk here.  I said, listen, first of all, I'm from Long Island.  It's right away.  She'd be like, dude, that's how screwed up I am.  I didn't even notice that you said the F word.  I'm looking at bro, I'm listening, I'm just like, yeah, yeah, F-ing, what?  She'd go, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.  I'm pitching this to me. 
[01:26:00]  I go, first of all, I'm from Long Island.  All right?  This is what I said.  I go, you're from Long Island, and you should know this.  I go, first of all, you don't betray friends, and you don't bite hands that feed you.  You hang out with them, they hang out with you.  You're friends.  You watch each other's back.  He goes, what did he go?  He goes, okay, respected, but...  So I was like, dude, all right. 
[01:26:30]  So yesterday, I go to promote, and he's really, you know, he really wants to do this thing.  And I'm home.  I'm like, yeah, okay, whatever.  So he wants to get a radio show together to go up against at night.  No, no, no, no, no.  If that is the truth, then that's his problem.  So he goes, um...  So I go, well, I'm doing this thing.  He goes, let's meet, let's meet.  I said, well, I got to do this radio thing so I can promote this bar tonight. 
[01:27:00]  So I go there, and he's like, dude, I'll come, and I'll meet you.  Shows up.  He goes, it's your gig, though.  You go on, you do what you got to do.  You go on, you're promoting, you go on, do what you got to do.  So I get on, and he's like, boom, in there.  Now, whatever, hanging out, hours up.  I'm like, okay, whatever.  Oh, no.  Then he goes, hey, you know Ron and Fetch?  You know those guys?  I go, yeah.  I know Ron. 
[01:27:30]  I started his club.  He says, well, you know, good friends.  I suppose you're on a Friday.  We should switch it up.  Maybe we can go on a Wednesday, and then you show up.  I go, well, um...  What's going on?  Right.  Exactly.  So I go, okay, okay.  Well, um...  Well, I know Ron.  I just, you know, it's kind of weird.  It is weird.  I can go on, Ron.  It's just weird, because we know each other then.  I had a little weird thing.  You know, it's a long story.  A little weird thing. 
[01:28:00]  Ron was in Florida.  Can we talk about this?  Yeah, go ahead.  Ron was huge.  Oh, yeah.  In Florida.  I mean, huge.  Beyond huge, my friend.  Absolutely monster.  Oh, in Florida.  And he had his own comedy club, and it was just kick-butt comedy club.  It was a great camaraderie.  We went there, and when Ron would show up, we'd be like, oh, my God!  Pennington's here tonight, man!  I'm doing my pigeon material. 
[01:28:30]  People are starting to say, what is everyone talking about?  What the hell is going on?  That's what I say.  All right.  We went way off course.  Where's the ship going, Captain?  I'm not sure.  I'll just keep pedaling.  So is there an end to the story that sums it up nice?  So now, all of a sudden, he just called here, and now I'm like, what?  He's following you.  I'm like, dude, what's up?  Was he out of his mind this morning?  Because he seems out of his mind right now.  He didn't seem like he was out of the mind. 
[01:29:00]  I don't know.  I've only met him once before, so now, the longest I've known him is like a day.  Right.  Oh, really?  This is weird.  He's trying to get a deal through his show.  It sounds like he's trying to get into the radio biz.  I don't know.  That's it.  Well, bring it on.  Have fun.  Maybe he's trying to get a little radio show together in hopes he can lure Brewer into the whole thing. 
[01:29:30]  Yeah, that'd be great.  All right.  We're going to take a full-time gig.  Hey, hi, everyone.  Listen, okay, what's up, Dick?  Damn, I've said that a hundred times.  Maybe we can have the Stephen Baldwin, Jim Brewer show for five minutes, ten minutes, whatever it takes.  Yeah, we'll give you guys a shot.  We'll shut up.  You guys get on the air and just let it roll. 
[01:30:00]  We've done this before.  So I guess Baldwin's on his way down, then.  Dude, wherever you go, he goes.  Look, dude, I swear on my daughter, I have no clue.  Nina has to say something.  Nina!  Nina!  Hello?  Hello, you, Nina.  Hello?  Hey, hey.  Hello?  Yeah, you.  Brewer?  Yes?  What are you talking about?  That's the longest story you ever told.  I know, sweetie.  I don't even know what I'm talking about. 
[01:30:30]  Yeah, this...  Why don't you guys do, like, some stoner spelling bee?  All right, we'll figure it out.  Thank you.  I'm having fun listening to Brewer just babble.  Oh, man.  People are saying this is the most fascinated I've been in a long time.  People are just fascinated.  I came in with my Walmart sneakers.  Yeah, where do you get those sneakers?  From Walmart.  They look like Walmart sneakers.  He's on the road, and he's sneakers, ten bucks.  There you go.  Velcro and all.  That's right.  All right, we've got to take a break.  We'll regroup, Anthony.  All right. 
[01:31:00]  There's a point to all this, I believe.  Right?  Well, maybe we'll even find out about it.  All right, we've got a penthouse pet outside.  Uncle John's here.  Uh-huh.  Ron Jeremy's on the way.  Oh, yeah.  And a really messed up Stephen Baldwin on the way.  Oh, man, I hope not.  Something's going to happen today.  I don't know.  Ð¥Ð¾Ñ€Ð¾ÑˆÐ¾.  What?  There's these big kids.  Whip, whip, whip, whip.  I'm loud.  Kids.  Whip, whip, whip, whip, whip.  I'm loud.  Kids.  Wednesday.  Soft the hook, yo.  Opie and A. 
[01:31:30]  Stinky, thank you.  I want to personally thank you for today's show.  Uh, Anthony, the sharper image.  Oh, I was listening to Brewer.  I...  All right, the sharper image.  Yes, sharper image now offering a mini fridge.  It's called the Hot and Cold Snack Box.  It's the first little personal electronic mini fridge.  My wife's bugging out.  Keeps food, drinks, and snacks cold, fresh, and ready to enjoy.  What's going on?  At work, home, or on the road.  This is really weird.  Not just a cooler. 
[01:32:00]  Why does he keep calling?  It actually chills beverages that start out warm.  I know why he's calling.  And keeps them ice cold.  Conveniently sized.  Hold up to a six-pack of drinks and a sandwich.  What do you say?  Fruit snacks.  I eat a lot, but I...  And keeps them well chilled and ready to enjoy.  Switch to hot.  It keeps your foods hot.  He wants to do regular things.  Just like takeout.  You don't want to do regular.  See the new Hot and Cold Snack Box for yourself at the 15 stores in the metro area.  Or shop at sharperimage.com.

[01:32:30]  Only from the Sharper Image.  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  1027 WNEW.  We're back with the O&A Show.  Jim Brewer in the studio.  Disturbed.  Down with the sickness.  Brewer playing Irving Plaza tonight and tomorrow night.  He'll sober up by then.  Nice head.  Anthony, I had some time to think about what was going on.  Yeah.  I figured it out.  Yeah.  Brewer was telling a story, and it looks like Stephen Baldwin is trying to get Brewer into radio. 
[01:33:00]  Right.  That's what I got out of that 20-minute spiel from Mr. Brewer.  Stephen Baldwin is trying to architect some kind of a radio deal.  I believe he's been talking to people, and he's trying to get Brewer on board to do a show with him.  But Stephen Baldwin is very obsessed with Brewer and this idea that he's been following Brewer around.  And Brewer is very paranoid at this point and freaked out about it, right?  Because he's showing up at places that you didn't even know. 
[01:33:30]  No one knows where you are, but he does.  Right.  Yes.  And now your wife, lovely lady, who's pregnant.  Yes, she is.  Second child.  Second child on the way.  Is getting a little nervous, too, because this guy's calling at all hours and following you around.  And she's worried about your health.  Quite frankly.  Think she might be in the mob?  What's going on?  What is going on?  You never wanted to do radio ever.  This makes no sense.  I don't get it.  I don't know either.  I guess if it's one day, week, out of the month. 
[01:34:00]  But what do I do when I don't want to do, like, TV or something?  She'll say, yeah, exactly.  Yeah.  So I don't get it.  So some guy's going to say, yeah, you can do the radio on Monday and Tuesdays.  But go ahead.  You're gone April and May.  What's that?  No.  All right.  There's something more behind this.  So then Baldwin, who's having his shoes signed downtown.  Yeah.  I'm just bringing everyone on the same page here.  It's a planet Earth.  The same wacky page.  Uh, Stephen Baldwin somehow knew that you were going to be on our show today.  Or was he listening? 
[01:34:30]  He had to be listening.  Or does he, or do you have a honing device on you or something?  Uh, now he's coming down to the station because he found out you're on today.  I didn't invite him.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Did not invite him.  No opinion.  Now outside we got Ron Jeremy.  We got girls.  Oh, Ron's here.  We got Hooters Girls with Wings, a penthouse pet.  Nice.  There you go.  Holy ass.  Nice.  Are you going to be able to perform tonight?  Of course you will.  Of course.  It's professional.  I'm on water now.  You're on water? 
[01:35:00]  Professional.  All right.  Professional.  All right.  Come on.  Okay.  Okay.  I was just asking her.  That's a concerned friend.  Moop.  I'm just flabbergasted at the, uh, thing of events.  Isn't that crazy?  Yeah.  Tell me about it.  It's been like in three days.  Vanessa.  Yes.  What's going on, Vanessa?  I was calling for the, um, Britney Spears tickets.  Oh, yeah.  We're doing Mommy.  What would you do for Britney Spears tickets?  We still got to get some Mommies for Friday, matter of fact.  Yes.  Vanessa, what would you do? 
[01:35:30]  Well, I couldn't come up with anything clever.  So, I was guessing, uh, some more, uh, like, uh, firework display with bottle rockets again.  Would you mind?  Or?  Huh.  Well, we've done that one before.  Well, I mean, I can't think of anything.  I don't.  We could up the ante and do it with the, uh, the back door action.  Oh, how about that?  Uh, I mean.  Would you launch a rocket out of your balloon knot?  Oh, my God.  I don't know.  I mean, I guess. 
[01:36:00]  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  You can't say it that way.  Sorry.  Sorry.  Yeah, don't mention any parts whatsoever, but, um, a bottle rocket launched from your balloon  knot.  I mean, I, I guess.  Whatever will make you guys happy is what I'll do.  That would rule, wouldn't it?  Did you guys see, uh, hold on to the line, okay?  Uh, go ahead, Barbara.  HBO, like the sex things, the weird sex.  Yeah.  You know how they have it? 
[01:36:30]  Oh, yeah.  Did you see that Japanese show?  Where they get, it was like a comedy troupe and the guy stuck a bottle rocket in his  behind.  They shut up.  It didn't go off right away, so it blew up.  Oh, blew up right by his balloon knot there.  You didn't see that?  No, I know.  I've seen plenty of those shows, though.  The Japs are insane with those shows.  Like, they have their version of Candid Camera, where they pretty much scare people to death.  Oh, I saw that one.  I saw one where this guy's walking around with a briefcase, and he puts it next to a  crowd and runs away.  And the people are like, ah, don't die. 
[01:37:00]  Ah, they scatter like ants.  It's great.  Blue knot, Joe.  What's up?  You do that now.  You attack him to the ground.  Yeah.  Eat up.  What's up, Joe?  What is going on up there today?  Well, I don't know.  Anthony's in another place because of NyQuil.  He's seeing tracers, and Brewer went to Club Stinky, and he hasn't been the same since.  Let me know if you've ever been like this.  You're sick with the flu, whatever it is I have.  You take medication, and then you stare for a while at some point, and your body gets 
[01:37:30]  so completely relaxed that you get this fuzzy, tingling feeling.  There's no, I don't hear anything.  I'm not thinking anything, and I'm just gazing off into space.  It's like listening to Plan 9 from Outer Space today.  It's out there.  Brewer, watch out for Stalker Steven.  Yeah, does he own a bed and breakfast?  Let me give you a massage, Brewer.  Very good, Joe.  Hey, can we get Ron Jeremy in here? 
[01:38:00]  Joe's below the belt.  What?  No.  What?  Let's get, yeah, they're telling me Ron Jeremy has to leave, and the penthouse chick has  to leave around six as well, so.  Oh, get him in.  It's like 20 after five.  Want you on Bolton?  Yeah.  Well, sure.  Why not?  Oh, man.  I got...  What's wrong now?  What's wrong, bro?  I'll tell you later.  There's a lot of...  I'll tell you later stuff going on today.  I know.  Ron Jeremy.  The Hedgehog.  What's up, yo?  How's it going? 
[01:38:30]  Great to be here, man.  Howdy.  Hey.  You're back.  You're back.  It's great to be back.  Did we have some virgins again today?  We had so much fun last time.  You remember Stalker Patty, yeah.  I heard.  I heard.  I heard.  I heard.  I got so much people coming up to me in the streets, man.  You guys must have some killer ratings, man, because everyone was talking about saying,  what does she look like?  Oh, my God.  I heard she's been...  I heard she's been...  Hold on.  Hold on.  She's been on your show a couple times.  Hold the phone, because Stephen Baldwin has a rock.  Stephen.  Look at Stephen.  I know, Steve.  He lays that up.  I know, Steve.  Stephen, man. 
[01:39:00]  Everyone in this place is trashed.  Yo.  Hi, Steve.  Grab a mic.  Is this on?  Yeah, that's on.  Stephen, you say hello.  How are you, kid?  It's Ron.  Ron, Jeremy.  It's Ron.  How are you?  We've hung out a couple times.  Have you?  Yeah.  Wow, man.  Last time I saw you was with Fruza Balk.  Every time I see you, it's like the first time.  Was he with her?  No, I was actually...  I was hanging out with her.  Really?  And then he came out.  We were chatting a little bit.  What's your name, dude?  That's Rick.  Rick.  Yeah.  Dude, he looks like a Vietnam vet. 
[01:39:30]  Who, Rick?  Look at his eyeballs.  They're like stewed tomatoes, man.  You mean a stoned Vietnam vet.  Who?  Rick?  And me?  And you're his publicist?  Uh, no.  No, she's a penthouse pet.  Of the year.  Of the year.  Oh, congratulations.  Pardon a moir.  Hey, why don't we get that medal to say?  $100,000 in gifts?  I love that.  Is that $100,000?  Brewer is freaking out right now.  Brewer, what's wrong? 
[01:40:00]  Is that $100,000 in gifts?  That's $100,000 in cash.  That's great.  Wow.  Congratulations.  That's good.  That's a nice honor.  It really is.  Baldwin.  You beat out some stiff competition.  Steven.  Wait, Ron.  Hold on a sec.  You're hot.  Get a grip.  You think he's hot there?  Dude, you're bugging me out.  Steven's bringing food.  What do you got?  Get on the mic, Steven.  He's got, like, food he's eating.  Steven, get on the mic.  No, no, man.  I'm here for Jim.  You're here for Jim? 
[01:40:30]  Steven, what's the deal with the radio show you want to put together, man?  I don't know what you're talking about, dude.  You got some radio deal?  I don't know what you're talking about.  Where's the virgin when you need her?  Steven, everyone's been talking about you and this radio thing.  You let the cat out of the bag this morning.  I did not.  Yeah, you did.  You're pissed that Brewer's talking about the radio thing.  I don't know what you're talking about, man.  Is that coleslaw he's eating?  Oh, my.  Steven, what have you been drinking or taking, man? 
[01:41:00]  What do you want?  Hey, Steven, have to remind him.  Guess what Steven Baldwin's on.  Think I were married, dude?  Because this chick's sick.  What's the fuck?  No, what the fuck?  You are on fire.  Well, she's the pet of the year.  That's what they're supposed to do.  Be hot.  Don't give her a beer.  Jesus.  She's being hot.  Give her some coleslaw.  Yeah.  Give her some of what's going to happen.  Give her a Polish kielbasa, actually.  What, Steven? 
[01:41:30]  Would you like some of my celery?  No, I'd rather have a big kiss.  Oh.  Look at you Baldwins, man.  You Baldwins are amazing.  Steven, go give her a kiss.  No, I'm good.  You're good?  What's the matter?  I remember you, you psycho.  Keep tass out.  Don't worry about it.  Who's he talking to?  You?  How do you remember me?  We met before.  We met before.  We probably did backstage at Brewer's last show.  No, that was your other brother.  The other one.  We've never met there, Steven. 
[01:42:00]  If you give her a kiss, we're not going to tell you your family.  Is he worried about his wife?  Brewer, I totally see what you're talking about.  If you give her a friendly kiss on the cheek, you need to be a nasty one.  Ron, you don't even know what's been going on the last hour.  There's a lot of weird things going on.  Guys, you had a virgin put her hand on my pants for U2 tickets.  How are you going to top that?  I know, exactly.  These guys had a virgin here last time I was on this show.  They had a lady who reached for U2 tickets in my pants.  We're going to have Steven Baldwin grab your hog.  He's not going to.  We're a manly man.  We don't do things like that.  No?  No, we're a manly man, right? 
[01:42:30]  All right.  Man, make a movie, Romeo and Julio.  Why don't we talk to the pet of the year?  That would be nice.  Why don't we do that?  Hi.  That's a good idea.  Hi, baby.  How are you?  Look how beautiful she is.  I don't know.  How am I?  You're very attractive.  You're stunning.  What's your name?  I don't even know your name.  I probably should know it, but...  You're fired.  Is everybody in here stoned?  Yeah, I'm not.  There's various levels of effed up it. 
[01:43:00]  I'm famous for not doing drugs.  If you weren't...  Ask me this.  Why do I need to know your name?  I have no idea.  Do I need to know yours?  No, I don't care.  Yeah, just get out.  Don't shower.  Just leave in the morning.  It's cool.  Are you saying that opium is...  Oh, you're saying opium hasn't showered?  Is it pronounced Megan Mason?  Yes.  It's a beautiful name and a beautiful girl.  Megan Mason.  Thank you.  Here's me trying to charm the young lady, you know.  Yeah.  We've seen what you can charm. 
[01:43:30]  You know, you had the other girl do these nasty things, right?  No, I can't.  No, we can't.  Do you like YouTube tickets?  Forget I asked.  Okay, forget about it.  They don't usually...  Penthouse Pets, Pet of the Year, whatever.  They come in.  We would love to see what they look like.  Um, unclothed, live, but they never show.  Are we already getting to the naked part?  Yeah, but you guys, we know the role.  We're not going to talk about the war.  You guys never, um, you never show.  They never show.  Really?  You never show the nudity. 
[01:44:00]  Well, I can't see it.  Well, that's not my fault.  Let me see.  Stand up.  Stand up.  Stephen, what do you think of that?  We love, uh...  We love...  Stand up for Stephen Baldwin.  Boobage.  Very nice.  Stephen can't see.  And she beat out some very stiff competition.  Wow, that's pretty good.  Frank Banks was the centerfold this year.  Yeah.  She beat out some very good competition this year.  I gotta give her that, and she showed, so...  That was very nice.  Zipped my lip.  Well, she showed the top.  Yeah.  Well, what do you think you're going to see there, Ron?  Well, I'm trying to get greedy.  Something you've seen.  Please.  She could show below the waist.  It's like seeing street signs to you. 
[01:44:30]  How many millions have you seen?  Well, not enough.  Not enough.  No biggie anymore.  We have a couple of Penthouse Pets in my documentary, you know?  Do you?  Good for you.  Do you still get all turned on when you see that area?  Yes, of course.  Yeah, beautiful women.  You know, it doesn't change.  It doesn't change.  No?  He got turned on by Stalker Patty.  Who are you kidding?  Did you really?  She had her cute moments.  Remember I had my hand in her pants to get something?  It was a ticket.  I forgot.  Yeah.  She was actually a little excited.  What happened to her, by the way?  She was killed in a horrible crash.  Did she finally get de-virginated?  No, no, no.  She'll never.  She'll never. 
[01:45:00]  You still go as the only guy that has ever touched her.  That's kind of exciting.  Brewer and Baller.  Listen, I look...  Hold on.  Guys, I looked at Barbara Walters in the face yesterday.  Nothing's going to shock me over again.  Are you all right, baby?  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  We'll talk about everything.  But there's another observation.  Brewer and Stephen Baldwin are communicating without even talking to each other.  They're just like laughing.  They're just looking at each other and communicating.  And Brewer's not giving them the high-five back.  These two are communicating without even talking.  They are on a whole other level. 
[01:45:30]  Holy Jesus.  Stephen is so effed up.  Look at him.  What's wrong with your face?  Stephen, are you okay?  What's wrong with your face?  Somebody spiked his coleslaw.  Stephen, what did you have today?  Brewer.  I'm going to be honest with you.  Yeah, Brewer.  Get on the mic, Brewer.  I haven't known Stephen...  How many times have we seen you?  We saw each other maybe three times before, like a day ago.  He's like this all the time.  Who's he calling a day ago?  Like 10 in the morning.  He's just like, hey, how you doing? 
[01:46:00]  He's looking at him.  He's laughing.  No, he got behind the thing.  Going behind the cat.  Dude is...  I don't think he's messed up.  I think he's 24-7.  You think they're just like that?  Stephen, do you do any kinds of drugs?  You know what's really, really funny right now?  You don't act like this on the Rosie O'Donnell show.  You know what's really funny right now?  Yeah, go ahead.  And then spontaneous laughter.  Stephen, finish your thought. 
[01:46:30]  He said, you don't act like that on Rosie O'Donnell.  Well, you know, it was for breast cancer.  Hi, how are you?  Speaking of breast, hi.  Here she is.  Pine House Pet of the Year.  Thanks, Ron.  Steve, but are you always like this?  No, but he's like, I think he's on heroin right now.  Who, Brewer?  And he's normal.  Isn't that the best?  Brewer?  So you would know because...  Oh, man. 
[01:47:00]  Is this the type of lighthearted banter we'll hear on your radio show, Stephen?  Brewer, you want to comment?  He says you're on heroin.  Exactly.  He says you're on heroin.  No, he's not.  You know, Ovi, I might listen to a radio show where Stephen Baldwin just comes on completely  effed up.  I don't even need to react to that.  All right.  Okay.  That was crazy.  Dude, you're crazy.  We've got to talk for a long hour.  I want to make sure you're all right.  I'm going to have to, like, spiritually enhance this dude. 
[01:47:30]  So we're going to send him to a priest.  I need help.  He needs aromatherapy.  Shh.  All right, so we have the pet of the year in the studio, Anthony, Megan.  Yeah.  Megan Mason.  We all feel like the listeners right now, because I think everyone's sitting going,  what's going on?  What is going on?  It's a party.  Exactly.  It was just a private party.  I think there's an intervention.  There's a lot of talent in this room right now.  So this is intervention for you, darling.  Ron Jeremy's here, ladies and gentlemen.  Yes.  Wait a minute.  There's talent and there's Ron Jeremy? 
[01:48:00]  No, no, no.  I got it.  I'm getting a little slam here.  No, you're not.  Well, after all the slamming you've done.  There's talent here, including Ron Jeremy.  Ah, there you go.  Including.  What's the word you should use?  We have all had seriously bad drug experiences because we couldn't be like you.  That's the reality.  What kind of drug experience did you have?  Girls do him because they want to.  Me, they do because there's a paycheck.  You know what I'm saying?  Right.  There's a difference.  You're doing just fine.  I've seen you with a lot of beautiful girls, actually.  A long time ago.  Now you're married now, I think. 
[01:48:30]  I'm a good boy.  Oh, now he's a good boy.  Oh, a good boy.  No, really.  I saw you last time with Lover Fruz.  You guys were discussing some kind of film project together.  Yeah.  You know, we were...  It was at the premiere of Boogie Nights or something like that.  I forgot where it was.  You know?  Steven, what's the drug of choice these days, man?  Because I got to get me some.  Clean and sober, 12 years.  Stop it.  Just stop it.  It's an act, guys.  It's an act.  Stop it.  It's coleslaw.  Clean and sober, 12 years.  January 21st, 13 years. 
[01:49:00]  Imagine what I used to be like 13 years ago.  No, thank you.  Maybe it's still in your system.  You're having a flashback.  Some residual.  Residual.  He's got a little residual.  Residual.  Brewer, get on that mic, man.  I'm dumbfounded.  Yeah, I don't know where to go.  I'm dumbfounded.  I know that Ron Jeremy's...  I'm dumbfounded.  There's a documentary going on, Ron.  I was reading the paper.  Yeah.  They had me on The View to discuss it, actually.  Yeah, you on The View is like... 
[01:49:30]  Pretty funny.  That I can't even imagine.  I just kind of like those ladies.  Don't they know what you do?  A little weird to that.  Well, Barbara Walters was the one who wasn't too sure about having me on the show.  And I wanted to ask her, didn't you also talk to Monica Lewinsky for a moment?  Right, right.  Without her magic act of hiding a cigar, I mean, she wouldn't just be a little pudgy intern.  Exactly.  So if we had her on the show, I don't know why she was so uncomfortable with me being there.  You know?  Yeah.  The ladies were nice.  I mean, I actually had a good time on there.  They weren't treating you like...  Yeah, I think I diffused them a little bit.  Did you see the show?  No.  No, I don't watch the new one.  They seem to like the documentary. 
[01:50:00]  They say he seems like a nice guy.  We don't want to like him.  We don't like that business.  Oh, yeah.  But they said he seems like a nice guy, so it was all right.  I kind of liked the show.  Yeah.  I think I diffused them a little bit.  You know, a little...  Did you?  Well, your personality is very good.  I'm not going to win them over.  I'll give you that.  I think I diffused them.  You know something?  Guaranteed, at least one of those girls locked the door, go in their house, and just watch...  Two of them admitted it.  They do.  They watch it, though.  Which one?  Star Jones?  No.  The other one.  The Asian girl?  Oh, right, right.  Lisa?  And also the Behar?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Joy Behar.  In the documentary, because we have Jim Brewer here, there's a Saturday Night Live. 
[01:50:30]  There's a little piece of Saturday Night Live in my documentary where John Lovett's  portrayed me on a skit on Saturday Night Live.  Oh, really?  And we have that in the documentary.  I knew that.  And we had to pay a lot of money for those rights, too, by the way.  Wait, wait.  Hold on.  Steven, where are you going?  Where are you going?  You're collecting your stuff.  What's going on?  I'll see you later, guys.  Something we said?  Something we did?  What happened, Steven?  She'll flash again.  Why don't you make it?  Wait, get on the mic.  Get on the mic.  Steven, what just happened?  What happened?  No, no, no, no.  I'm not supposed to be here, man. 
[01:51:00]  But you are.  You're a sweet gal.  Can I have a hug at least?  Steven just picked up his stuff.  And he's leaving.  It starts with a hug.  It starts with a hug.  He doesn't realize that she's the one from the magazine.  Bruit, did you kick him out?  Hey, you're a healthy gal.  Did you say, dude, get out of here?  Bruit, what happened?  What happened?  Steven, why are you leaving her?  It starts with a hug.  Then it's a back massage.  I got it going on later.  There's some other guys I'm talking to later.  Oh, I see. 
[01:51:30]  But Megan is here.  He's going to be on, you're going to be on Ron and Chris later?  And I saw him got a hug.  Oh, there you go.  I'm going to give Megan a hug.  It's a radio marathon for Steven Bolton.  There you go.  Megan, you should stand up and hug him.  Really, he'll go for it.  Yeah, Megan, give him a hug before he goes.  The guy's at South, you've got to be aggressive, Megan.  No, he's clean and sober 13 years, Ron.  Here we go.  Here we go.  There it is.  Look at that bod.  Did you like that hug there, Steven?  How about a kiss? 
[01:52:00]  Not a kiss, not a kiss, not a kiss?  No, no, no, no, no, no.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  No kisses, okay.  You do that.  I'm trying to be a director again, aren't I, guys?  Yeah, see?  Not after what he just said.  Yeah, I'm a investigator.  Hey.  Oh, really?  All right.  A lot going on in here, man.  All right.  Yeah, I was supposed to be here.  Why don't we draw hands and sing We Are The World?  What do you say?  Steven, you are so effed up.  Steven, get on the mic and say goodbye the right way.  Yeah, Steven, you've got to say goodbye, man.  You've got a lot of people, say bye.  No, the audience. 
[01:52:30]  Not Brewer.  It's called a microphone.  Yeah, you're going to go into radio.  You've got to learn how to, you know.  You're going to be at the Brewer Show tonight?  Irving Plaza?  Absolutely.  Jim Brewer is at Irving Plaza tonight, ladies and gentlemen.  I'm going there, and I am doing a freaking skydive out of the balcony into the mosh pit.  There you go.  Hold on.  Ron's on the phone from Ron and Fez.  Ronnie.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Ron.  Ron.  We had nothing to do with this one.  I am all in favor of you guys keeping Steven Baldwin. 
[01:53:00]  And then out of the studio by 645.  No, you're going to have Steven all night long.  No.  This is your show tonight.  No.  We gave you a little preview of what your show is going to be like tonight.  But, Ron, I'm in love with you.  You don't understand.  He brought you coastline.  I've been stalking Ron and Fez.  He is...  See, we're on at nights, guys.  Or as the Baldwins call it, party time. 
[01:53:30]  Well, it seems that any time is party time.  Anytime a Baldwin gets an idea, they call the show.  And normally...  Normally, it always goes back, hey, what if you lit that on fire?  Wow.  Hey, Ron?  Yeah?  I'll see you soon, pal.  Pal.  No.  You remember the deal.  If you get Alec, you can come in. 
[01:54:00]  Oh!  Yeah.  Yeah, baby.  That's the deal.  Hey, you guys in radio are vicious, eh?  Well, you've got to learn how to get that way when you do your show on K-Rod.  Right.  You don't want me to pull this hog out.  Trust me, boys.  You don't want to get me started, Ronnie.  You don't say things like that when Ron Jarvis is in the studio.  I'll take it out and beat you over the head like an ugly red-headed stepchild.  Oh, Jesus.  Who has a straitjacket?  Jesus Christ.  Wow. 
[01:54:30]  Oh, Jesus.  Well, he's...  I'll stick it right in your six, prison style.  All right, Ronnie, he's collecting his stuff.  It looks like he's leaving the studio.  Stay for a while.  Once again.  No, no, I'm out.  Hey, Ronnie.  Yeah.  I miss you, man.  Oh, Jesus.  Hey, bro, you want to go half-ease on a restraining order?  And there he goes.  Steven has just left the studio.  Oh, my.  He is staggering down the hall, Ronnie.  You have no idea how frightening he can be at night. 
[01:55:00]  It's very strange.  Brewer is really freaked out.  No joke.  I'm not.  He's like, you're out of your mind, Brewer, with this whole thing.  I want to cry.  He wants to cry.  Is it that bad?  I just...  Yeah.  That was weird.  Very weird.  Opie, you got to tell me...  Our phone screener stopped 13 calls from him one night.  I want what he's on.  The next day, we called some guy's baton and it's Steven Baldwin, but it wasn't.  It was actually him.  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:55:30]  Whew.  You got to promise me, Opie, tomorrow, tell me if this was all just a medicated haze that  I'm in.  Because I'm starting to think, like, this isn't...  It's happening.  It's just like my medication.  It's a mess of a radio show today.  Wow.  I'm going to do some time on the Ron and Fez show so I can do some normal radio today.  You're invited, Opie.  All right.  After the Brewer show, I think I'm going to stop by.  If Baldwin's coming back, I'm coming back.  Yeah, take him to the show first.  We will.  And then everybody come back later.  All right.  All right? 
[01:56:00]  Is that the deal?  Yeah.  All right.  See you, guys.  Thank you, Ronnie.  Later, Ron.  Ron from Ron and Fez on after us here in New York.  What was that all about, man?  And then you were talking to him and then he picked up and left.  What happened?  You told him to get the hell out of here, right?  Did you kick him out?  No, no, no.  He said...  I thought you met...  At one point you went, dude, get the F out of here.  I was just looking at him.  Yeah.  He goes, I'm not...  He said, I'm not supposed to be here.  Yeah.  I said, okay.  Oh, he's still here, Stinky?  Where's he now?  What's he doing?  Hold on.  Stinky's back.  He's reading all the bad calls on the phone screener there. 
[01:56:30]  Oh, there's some bad ones up there, too.  He's answering the phone.  All right.  Wait, wait, Stinky.  Because Stinky...  Stephen Baldwin's our phone screener for the day.  Stinky ran in here because...  This is some of the things that people want to say to Stephen.  Is Stephen the one that looks like Alex with Down syndrome?  Oh, my God.  He's reading all that, right?  Is this going to hurt his chances of being Barney Rubble again?  All right, get him back in here for a second. 
[01:57:00]  I thought he was screening calls for us.  Hey, Ron, is it true that you gave yourself oral favors once?  I did it a long time ago.  Yes.  You could do that?  If I'm a girl around here like Megan, I would never have to do that.  Actually, I won't be able to do that.  I don't know where he's been.  You can still do this?  Well, since I went to too much time at the buffet, I could just...  Yeah, it's a little hard to get around.  That's about it.  Just the tip.  What a disgusting conversation.  Megan's not going to respect me anymore, guys.  No, no. 
[01:57:30]  It's okay.  Well, I don't know what's going on.  Stephen Baldwin is answering your phone calls right now.  Is he going to come back again?  Oh, Miller's going to go.  No, he's got the headset on and everything.  He's got the headset on and everything.  He's all laughing.  He's out there screaming the calls.  Great.  Great.  Stephen Baldwin.  Look at Ben.  Ben's laughing his ass off because Stephen Baldwin's screaming the calls.  Hold on.  He's answering the calls like, who are these dudes, Don and Mike?  He doesn't even know what he's talking about.  What's up, Ray?  No, he's screaming, pick up line seven. 
[01:58:00]  Tell him to pick up line seven.  It's a bad call, but...  Yeah.  All right.  Oh, my God.  Megan, could you hang for a few more minutes?  And we'll get into what you're...  I'll hang.  Okay.  I'm cool.  Of course you will.  This is too much fun today.  Brewer.  It's Megan Mason, the pet of the year from Penthouse.  Ron Jeremy.  And the very freaked out Jim Brewer.  Brewer.  Here, get on mic there, Brewer.  Brewer.  Wanted to have some wings.  Just wanted to hang, right?  Beer.  Yeah.  And now you've got the insane Stephen Baldwin. 
[01:58:30]  He's stalking you, bro.  He's following you now.  I'm literally freaking out.  Dude, here's what happened, Opie.  I'll tell you exactly what happened.  Someone spoke to Stephen about some kind of radio deal to put together.  Nothing in stone.  Nothing big.  Maybe he might meet with somebody that, you know, will talk to somebody kind of thing.  And now he's, like, scrambling, like, oh, Brewer's good.  I'll get Brewer.  And, like, that's the idea of the minute, you know, that him and Brewer are going to do.  And then after a while, he'll move on to something else. 
[01:59:00]  Well, it's not like another Flintstone movie is coming his way.  He's a madman.  Okay, Fred.  Line seven, Fred.  Which way did he go, George?  Oh, you see, he goes, oh, the hotline's ringing.  And he went running out.  Like Stephen Baldwin's going to pick up the hotline.  It's going to be like some CBS executive.  I think he did, though.  All right.  Right now, he's the most still and, like, controlled he's ever been.  He's out there just listening.  And he's looking the other way from the phones. 
[01:59:30]  All right.  Well, we're going to take a break.  Wow.  Yeah.  And, well, someone's going to have to die today.  And we'll find out who next.  All the news you need to know and moves.

[02:02:00]  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  1-0-2-7-W-N-E-W.  Stone Cold Radio.  Yeah, we're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  What a mess of a day.  Paul from Jersey says, that last segment, as confusing as Biodome.  Well, Dave from Jersey writes, Stephen is still messed up from Biodome.  Yeah.  All right.  Here's the deal.  Let me set the stage here.  Jim Brewer in the studio.  He's playing Irving Plaza tonight and tomorrow. 
[02:02:30]  A bunch of us going to tonight and tomorrow.  Well, we're going to both shows.  Yeah, we'll be late back.  We'll see you down there.  Ron Jeremy in the studio.  He's talking about a documentary that's out on his life, right?  Called Porn Star, The Legend of Ron Jeremy.  And it's playing in Cinema Village here in Manhattan starting Friday night.  Which is at 22 East 12th Street.  And then we have Megan Mason, Head of the Year from Penthouse.  Beautiful, beautiful script.  We just looked at her pictures there in Penthouse.  Wow.  And she has a website, www.megan-mason.com. 
[02:03:00]  There you go.  Ice cream.  And don't forget, Penthouse.com.  Penthouse.com, of course.  She's incorporating one of those glass-blown dildos in her spread.  Definitely.  You see those things?  Creative.  They're like the latest Rage.  I saw a whole show on them.  They make these glass dildos.  They're super smooth and easy to clean.  And you're using some kind of a double-sided one in that.  It's like got a hook on it, Opie.  Well, she's got a talent there.  There's one big side. 
[02:03:30]  And then at the end, where normally you'd put your hand, is a little hook that gets smaller  at the other end and goes somewhere else.  Ah, ah, ah.  Just say that.  Hey, we all have our pleasure, boy.  That's amazing.  I was thrilled.  And Stephen Baldwin, who cannot leave.  I saw you.  Hi, baby.  We missed you.  Stephen Baldwin back in the studio.  Fine talent.  Stephen.  Seriously.  A lot of people are saying that you have a crush on Jim Brough.  Seriously.  Let's just bring it out in the open here.  Were you guys talking about me?  Because my ass got hot.  So usually somebody's ears get hot. 
[02:04:00]  But me, my...  Well, Stephen...  Speaking of asses, show them that picture there with the dildo, you know.  Yeah, yeah.  Open up that pen pass.  I love how Ron Jeremy thinks.  Speaking of asses, how about that dildo?  Right.  That was the opening conversation.  See that little hook thing that she has there in the way.  Show it to him.  Stephen, you're wearing clogs?  Yeah, I'm wearing clogs.  I just had them shine.  Well, they are shiny clogs.  I talked to you before.  I was getting them shine.  Those are some shiny clogs.  Those aren't clogs, though.  Isn't that nice?  Those aren't really clogs.  It's a clog.  It's a clog.  Stephen, what kind of hair gel do you use? 
[02:04:30]  You go to Holland, the same one that Cameron Diaz uses.  Oh, God damn.  Spunk.  That was good.  I love it.  Wow.  Spunk.  Ratings here.  We go through the roof for your little radio show.  Yeah, when did that start?  When do you hear more like that?  For real, though, what do you think, man?  Hypothetically.  Hypothetically.  If you had a radio show.  Brower Baldwin, Jim and Steve.  Uh-huh.  We would suck.  Morning. 
[02:05:00]  As the sports guys here on our station.  Somebody called and said we'd be funnier than that guy Mike in the afternoon.  All right.  Who's Mike?  Who's Mike in the afternoon?  I don't know.  Who's this guy?  Who are you?  That's Ben.  That's Ben.  Every time somebody laughs about me, you crack up.  Ah, that's true.  Who is this guy?  That's true.  Hey, Kim, we've got to ask you something.  Do you have a crush on Bruce?  Oh.  Wow.  You can't say that?  Okay.  Bye, guys.  You can.  They are bye, guys. 
[02:05:30]  Well, you can't say that.  The gay bald one.  Yeah, yeah.  No pun intended.  The gay bald one.  Yeah.  I'm bi-coastal.  You would do that to a brewer, huh?  I'm bi-coastal.  Dude, they just called from the venue downtown.  Everyone's wanting their money back.  Because you're gay.  You're just calling for a gay.  There was some day there, but I don't know.  That would not affect his population in New York.  Oh, my God.  It would be fine.  I better defend my gayness.  Yeah, Brewer.  Brewer.  Married, one kid, one on the way. 
[02:06:00]  No, no, no.  Let me defend my gay.  I'm not gay.  I swear on my mother.  Steven, what is in your pocket?  Dude, this is the...  No, really.  Oh, you had to ask him.  No, that...  What is...  What is in your pocket?  Yeah, don't...  No, don't...  Yeah.  Are you...  Oh, my God.  Is that...  Are you sporting?  No.  Get the metal detector on that thing.  That's not a tent.  I need to see what that is.  You're sporting for some goat.  Because that's awfully large.  Is that your...  Is that your junk?  Uh-oh. 
[02:06:30]  The metal detector's beeping.  It's like Spinal Tap.  It's a cucumber wrapped in tinfoil.  All right, that's his phone.  Okay.  Where's the roller quarter stuck in there?  Unless he has some of the metal insert in that thing.  No, there's...  There's nothing there now.  Okay.  It was the phone.  That was the phone.  The thing was my cell phone.  This is my hog.  There's a big difference.  Oh, my God.  Is that because you're a pig?  Yeah, I think you're...  I think you're working it.  You got it all juiced up.  Woo! 
[02:07:00]  See you later, kid.  All right.  See ya.  All right.  There he goes again.  All right.  Steven Ball.  There he goes, Steven, again.  Look for him for...  Go Red Fire Dome.  Don't trip down the stairs.  ...radio show.  I don't know.  Couldn't he leave the coleslaw?  There he is.  He's over there.  So, Brewer, when's the debut of the radio show?  Stop, man.  It's not even funny.  No, it's very funny.  It's not funny.  It's very funny.  Damn.  This is creepy.  Brewer, I can't tell you how creeped out Brewer is right now. 
[02:07:30]  He's like freaking out.  You know what?  Therapy is going to be the first hour tonight on stage.  Yeah.  I'm just going to talk and not be funny.  And then I walk in and this dude shut up.  So, if you imagine some guy, like you have your career, right?  Mm-hmm.  Now, some guy just starts stalking you and following you around, trying to get you to  do, like...  Things.  Things.  And they show up everywhere.  And all of a sudden, all of a sudden, you find out that they're attached to a project  you already did.  And you didn't know it at the time. 
[02:08:00]  No way.  And it's like all of a sudden, the name keeps popping up.  You wouldn't know, right?  You'd freak out.  So, this is bugging him out.  There he goes.  Steven Baldwin.  Is he finally leaving?  Take it easy, Steve.  We'll see you soon.  Is he leaving?  I'll believe it when I see him.  Brewer, he wants you to look at him.  He's waving.  He's waving at you, Brewer.  He's waving.  He's waving at you.  Wow.  I'm a dork for not getting that.  What?  What did you just say? 
[02:08:30]  What did I just say?  Attached to another project.  Right.  Yeah.  Wow.  See, all of a sudden, you just find that he's popping up all over the place.  It's a little strange.  So, Ron.  Aren't there any rock and roll tickets that Megan needs?  How's the ID?  Remember Stalker, was it Stalker Sally was her name?  Patty.  Patty.  Doesn't Megan need any tickets to any rock bands?  Always.  Come on.  Explain to her why I'm saying that, of course.  Well, we did a little.  Hold on. 
[02:09:00]  What?  What's going on over there?  Stalker Patty had to get you two tickets.  I'm just listening to Conspiracy Curious.  Okay.  Conspiracy Curious.  As far as I heard, I think Stephen Bolton was on the grassy knoll at some point.  Who's your favorite band, Megan?  Rock and roll band.  Oh, that's really tough.  That plays in New York.  Or you're from Houston.  I'm from Houston.  Cool.  Take your shirt off.  What do you like?  Do you like the country music?  Let's go, Astros.  Take your shirt off.  Let's see what you got, Hammer.  Okay.  Bite me. 
[02:09:30]  How long we got to wait?  I never heard of bite me.  Nine.  Take it off, Hammer.  What's the difference?  Show us what you got.  All righty then.  Megan, it's to you.  Brewer would like to see your cans again.  Are they real cans?  No.  Why don't you come over here, lift up my shirt, and take a look through your damn song?  I can tell by looking from here.  Well, come a little closer.  I can see perfectly.  We can change places.  I see clearly now the shirt is off.  Anthony, Stephen Baldwin did an ID for our show. 
[02:10:00]  Did he?  Did he really?  Hey, this is Stephen Baldwin, and you're listening to Opie and Anthony.  No, that's bad.  Wow.  You guys are hardcore over here on Opie and Anthony.  You're like, mean.  What happened?  Why is the radio so mean?  Oh, my God.  It's a metal potion.  I love it.  Wow.  It does cry.  It's weird. 
[02:10:30]  So you guys have YouTube tickets anymore?  No.  No, no.  Well, whose tickets do you have?  Are you trying to get her naked, Ron?  No, but reaching the pants.  You won't get completely naked, will you?  No, she don't do that.  Well, you guys have tickets to any bands?  He don't know anybody very well, do he?  Oh.  Oh, you would get totally naked?  I consider it.  Oh.  Nice.  Wow.  Nice.  Would you reach into someone's pants?  You don't understand.  You don't understand how happy it would make all the guys here in the studio if you would 
[02:11:00]  completely get unclothed.  Hold on.  Oh, my goodness.  Let me just check and see if I'm wearing underwear first.  Oh, those pesky underwear.  Why don't you check there?  Sure.  Oh, my God.  Give a look.  I am.  You are.  Is that a good thing or a bad thing for us?  That's a great thing for me.  It sucks for you.  Whoa.  Why?  But there's either.  Oh, there's.  Well, I'll go see.  I'll tell you what.  What are they riveted on?  If you can guess what color they are, I will take them off. 
[02:11:30]  Take your shirt off.  Let's see what you got already.  Craying out loud.  I'm saying.  People in Afghanistan.  Gee, girl, help brother out.  We all want to guess?  Does someone want to blow his freaking brains out?  I don't mind.  We love the brewer guy.  She can speak English.  Get her a job.  And fabulous, darling.  How long have you been gay?  Come out of the closet lately?  Maybe you should hook up with Steve and do radio in the morning.  That was funny.  Steve and Megan. 
[02:12:00]  It's the Steve and Megan show.  Steve and Megan.  Stephen, me again.  Her last name is Mayson, so.  Oh, Mason and.  Steve Mason.  Balinski.  Steve Mason.  Another one for New York.  Okay.  All right.  So where are we at with this?  How far are we going to get?  You can't jump for the pants to come off because something would die.  Yeah, the underwear.  I think it's pink.  White.  She had no problem with the glass stuck in the snoutter.  I'm not a freaking genie in a bottle.  You're not going to rub me three times.  I say pink.  Okay.  I got a pink and I got a white and you're both wrong. 
[02:12:30]  So one more gas.  Uh-oh.  Oh, BTO.  This is a hard one.  This is a hard one.  You got to go with that.  This is really hard.  Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do.  It's definitely black, you think?  All right, go ahead.  Is that black for your final answer?  Black.  You're so fired.  Hold on.  Is it?  Let's see.  Yeah, we're going to see.  Here we go.  Let's take a look, see.  All right.  This is Megan Mason, Anthony, the pet of the year.  She does have very confidence.  Yeah.  Tremendous.  Oh, what?  That looks black. 
[02:13:00]  That's black.  It is see-through.  It's see-through black.  Purple, black.  Purple, whatever.  It is see-through.  You said you'll show the underwear because we didn't guess.  You want to take the underwear off?  Oh, it is purple.  You said you'll show it.  No, I said if you guess it's not the underwear.  Oh, God.  Oh, but you can keep the underwear on.  Take off the dress.  Oh, shut up.  Not going to happen.  All right, I want to thank Megan Mason for coming by.  Houston Rocks.  Now, take your shirt off.  We're crying out loud.  It's 400 degrees in Houston, Texas. 
[02:13:30]  You can keep the underwear on.  You've got bowl players like Moises Alou.  Take your shirt off.  See what you got, Hammer?  Jeff Bagwell's in the house.  Where are you going?  So, uh, look at that.  Ah, look at that.  At least topless.  There you go.  Brewer, will that satisfy you a little bit?  I think, well, it's up to you.  What are we doing?  We've got time, right?  Yeah, we have time.  Let's see a little, you know, a little woo-woo-woo backside in the cave. 
[02:14:00]  Let's see a little Osama came back.  Backside in the cave?  Hallama, hallami, hallama.  You like the cave?  Look at the issue.  It's right there in front of you.  I can't read.  Something different about two-dimension.  It's a picture.  You don't have to read.  Live is always better, though.  It's true.  You ever see a band and, like, on a...  I never understood.  They're good in a CD, but they see it live.  Like, these guys are great!  I never understood.  Especially Penthouse Pets, where they're a lot more liberal about what they show.  Penthouse Pets of the year.  Of the year.  What you're showing there. 
[02:14:30]  I mean, there are parts of your anatomy that leave nothing to the imagination.  Yet, when you come in live, you're very coy and shy about it.  And this isn't just you.  This is every girl from Penthouse we've had come in here, or Playboy.  The competition, I know.  But, you know, naked women and whatnot.  The back of Debbie.  But they never want to get naked live.  But yet, in the pictures, there's everything right now.  Look at that.  Isn't that nice?  You can see what you had for lunch in that one.  Well, she said you would actually show your underwear.  You just said you wouldn't take it off, unless you guess the color. 
[02:15:00]  Okay, but then I'm going to take off the boots and then the tights.  No, you can just lower it.  You can just lower it.  You can just lower it.  You don't have to go.  Ron knows how it works.  You can just lower it.  We don't have to go lower it.  You know, we're fair.  I'm going to bend you over a console, tag you.  It'd be great.  You won't be able to sit for a week.  I'm going to be an actress.  But before I do, I'm going to show my vagina.  Well, I'm just a southern girl, and we were talking about something.  But I only do it in pictures.  Only in pictures. 
[02:15:30]  I know an Afghanistan joke.  Not really live.  I know nothing.  Cut to it.  We'll give you 500 more thousand.  Give me the glass thing.  I want to stick that right.  I'm going to get movies out of here.  Yeah, yeah.  Another one bites the dust.  Another one bites the dust.  What the hell do you dream about at night, son?  Wow.  And Carol must be proud. 
[02:16:00]  Listen, whatever happened to your singing career?  You went to Hollywood.  You met some kooky people.  And I'm reading this magazine, and I see there's a glass thing in its shape of a donkey.  What the hell is going on?  Then you're sitting next to a guy with a donkey from here to New Mexico.  Do something about it.  You're a star now.  Take it off, Hammer.  Welcome to the show. 
[02:16:30]  Welcome to the show.  Oh, my God.  Why don't you go grab Stephen House's coleslaw?  Wow.  You're right.  All right.  I'm the penthouse star of the year.  Next, I'll be mayor.  But before I do, check out the vagina.  Hey, it's hot.  Mom wanted me to be a ballerina.  It paid so much.  It helped me through school and everything.  Mom said you were going to be a ballerina. 
[02:17:00]  One day, I was going to be a ballerina because of fourth grade, but then this girl, and she took my friend, Ralph, we made out, but we didn't do nothing.  He showed me his, I showed him his.  You know, actually, I'm studying psychology, and as soon as I get my doctorate, I'll give you my card.  You're failing.  I'll give you my card.  He's a dick.  Give me a D.  What's your psych, what's his name?  Let's call him right now.  He's failing horrendously. 
[02:17:30]  Okay, you really missed that because that's going to be me, and you're going to come see me.  I'm going to be a my card.  I can't wait.  Okay, smart guy.  Drink up, buddy.  I've been nursing one for like three hours.  Yeah, me too.  It's warm.  Cool, great.  Then take your shirt off, Hammer.  I did.  Like twice.  What do you think his problem is if you're going to be a psychologist?  What is my problem?  ADD.  ADD.  Definitely ADD. 
[02:18:00]  John Bobbin.  That's a very popular diagnosis.  He needs some Rentalin.  He needs some Van X.  He needs some Valium.  He needs some hammer on his head to knock him out.  Been waiting for two hours.  There's people around the world right now.  Hold on, hold on.  That is not true.  Hold on.  You have been watching.  Hold on.  They're dumping out like crazy, unfortunately.  Are they?  Yeah.  What are they dumping that?  Flowers.  I can say that.  Show your flowers.  Okay, for two hours, you've been watching Stephen eat coleslaw, so don't even pull that with  me.  That's like, huh? 
[02:18:30]  She said like coleslaw.  Okay, coleslaw.  But anyway, you want to see my balloon nut?  Ha ha ha ha ha ha.  Aunt Mary, I'm going to send you a postcard from the bed I'm getting railroaded from.  But distribution is in Australia, so I get perks.  This business works.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Welcome to the show.  So you want to be an actress? 
[02:19:00]  Ha ha ha ha ha ha.  Those are the breasts.  You know you want me, you big dirty whore.  Those are the best breasts ever.  Now show them.  Okay.  Wow.  Show some respect, Brewer.  She's pet of the year.  I must say, she is beautiful.  It's not his fault.  He's an idiot.  It's okay.  I know.  Don't call our friend an idiot.  Jim.  No, I was being honest.  Sometimes I'm an idiot.  Sometimes I'm an idiot.  Sometimes I'm an idiot.  Are you familiar with Jim Brewer?  Jim needs to be.  Unfortunately.  Are you?  Yeah. 
[02:19:30]  Oh, man.  I can request you a therapist.  No, I'm going to be your therapist as soon as I graduate.  You are.  You're going to show your psychology.  Good.  Maybe I can show you my flowers.  A natural psychology?  Well, I've been seeing her for a while, and this is what I came out to.  There's my cannons.  Brewer's showing his can.  Now, where's yours?  Now, come on.  Brewer has taken his shirt off.  What do you think?  Look at that belly.  Is it a girl or a boy?  Doesn't matter.  So I showed mine.  Show yours, Hammer.  Where you at?  Good Lord. 
[02:20:00]  The stomach?  We've got people waiting with their donkeys.  Let's go.  You've seen it, like, twice.  Buzz kill.  I think you want.  Buzz kill.  Wait, wait, wait.  I offered for you to come over and feel him yourself, and you said, no, my microphone's  over here.  He wants to see the other thing.  He wants to see the other thing.  Heine.  The other thing.  What's the other thing?  Oh, you want to see your butt?  Yeah, show him, Heine.  Rear end.  Rear end.  There you go.  Rear end.  Here we go.  Here we go.  Because you've got a nice ass.  If you say something nice. 
[02:20:30]  Say something nice, Brewer.  Please.  May I see...  May I please see your booper?  That's a lovely ring.  I love your haircut.  Say she has beautiful blue eyes.  You have the best blue eyes I've ever seen.  They come from the colors of above the sky.  Now take your shirt off and show us your booper, Hammer.  You've got nice eyes.  Good Lord.  How long does a Hammer have to wait? 
[02:21:00]  I'm going to get drunk and fight Mexicans if she don't show it in another fort.  You're going to crash your behind now tonight.  Oh, my God.  Oh, I can say coochie, coochie, coochie, coo.  Show me the other side, you wacko.  She's going to be an actress.  I know.  Knock it off.  Yeah.  I do have a good...  Yeah.  We should talk, and we'll talk about script ideas and stuff.  There you go.  Not.  So, did that help?  Are you going to show your behind? 
[02:21:30]  Megan, did that help?  Did that help?  You know what?  That actually made it worse.  You know what's doing is because I love you.  You know that, right?  Yeah, obviously.  You know, I remember in school, the kids that used to treat you the worst were the ones that  liked you the most.  See, that's what it's all about.  So, everybody hated me because they all loved me.  Right.  Yeah.  Psychology, what?  Your parents divorced?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You're a shocker.  And you're like, what?  You know, like...  I'm just asking, baby.  I'm coming at you.  Oh, my family's mangled.

The guy shows his donkey either gets hit or he's thrown in the car for the night.  Jay, put your donkey back.  I might enjoy watching that.  Roar!  Look at it!  Jay, put it back.  It's not funny.  Roar, it's funny.  Jay, put it back.  It's not funny.  I got to catch a flight.  Are you going to flash your...  Oh, yeah.  We got to get Roger out of here.  Show Ron.  Show Ron.  Show Ron, man.

You guys, you're so.  The underwear up, not down.  It's like a Chinese mob star.  I don't understand.  I'm just going to drop off some food for you guys, guys.  You won't let us show her her dumper?  There's no rules.  They're going to divide by, but I'm going to give her a quick piece.  What rule is that?  But it's Penta.  You're not running the state department.

[02:25:30]  Sweetie.  Be careful.  I love you.  Cheers, love.  Be careful.  All right.  We're going to take a break.  Now go make some movies.  What?  See you later.  At least you're mad at Brewer.  Who's she mad at?  Are you mad?  Who are you mad?  No, babe.  I'm happy.  All right.  Good.  All right.  Don't sigh.  That's loud next time.  It's radio.  It's fun.  It's light.  All right.  It's true.  Thank you.  All right.  All right.  Mike, you got these?  You got them, Mike?  What do I do with them? 
[02:26:00]  All right.  Thanks, man.  Make sure she gets fed.  It's that Brewer.  Make sure she gets fed.  Thank you.  Hey, thank you.  God bless you.  All right.  Be careful.  We'll take a break and we'll be back, Anthony.  Check out.  Opie and Anthony.  And on the eighth day, God said, let there be breasts.  Booze.  Wow.  You know what I mean?  It's the bitches that are gitches.  It's the bitches that are gitches.  We're going to be here.  Oh, man.  Ah, we're hanging with Jim Brewer. 
[02:26:30]  Oh, yeah.  What a fun-filled, action-packed day.  This is the Opie and Anthony show.  After this, we're going right to Irving Plaza to check out Brewer.  A few tickets remain.  Come on down and hang with us, man.  Can I lick your hineys for a second?  I was in Tampa.  Tampa?  Yeah.  Tampa, Florida.  On stage in Tampa, the dude calls out a bit from your show that was in Philly. 
[02:27:00]  Oh, well, we're on in Philly?  Tell the mescaline story!  I'm in Tampa going, what?  What did this get done with me?  You know, the rest of the crowd's looking like...  What?  Yeah.  Dude.  That's pretty cool.  Wow.  You guys are a disease, and I'm proud of you.  Yeah, we try.  Well, this was a mess of a disease today.  I think someone's foot fell off.  Hey, I had fun today.  That's a disease.  Something's going on today.  We blew off our damn contest.  Now we're screwed for Friday.  You know that, right? 
[02:27:30]  We're doing...  Mommy, what would you do for Britney Spears tickets?  We got great tickets to the show next week.  Another fine broad.  We got a limo ride.  We got spending money, free dinner.  Music sucks, so show your pooper!  We can make millions, you dumb whore!  Show your breasts, you're talented!  I never understand that.  Oh, will they listen to the music?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  They'll listen to music.  Go show your rectum on a Friday afternoon.  Get some dancers behind you and bring Jeremy to the show. 
[02:28:00]  Hey!  I never understand why they do that.  They're penthouse pets.  Money.  They come to a radio show or whatever they're doing.  The reason that people know them and enjoy them is because they're naked.  Right.  It's not, you know, she seems like a nice enough girl, but we don't know her from her conversation  or anything else.  It's the glass dong that she was using that captivated me. 
[02:28:30]  But it's part of show business.  It's a sad, sickening side of show business.  Yeah.  You know what?  The male guys are the same way.  Like, I got stuck in.  I don't know if I remember telling you guys, but when I first said, all right, I'm going  to be an actor.  Anyone who wants to be an entertainer, we're just, we run after, like, we're going to be  like, Jim Carrey.  And we'll believe anyone.  We'll believe a drunk.  We are whores.  We are hookers.  Managers know it.  And they sit there and they go, you know, I've got some contact. 
[02:29:00]  And they just drop names.  And so I was talking to Stallone on HBO when I was with Bruce Willis.  Now take your shirt off.  Now suck it.  Suck it.  But if I can show my poop.  And it just happens.  I was in Florida and I went to this place and I said, I'm going to be an actor.  And I looked in the paper and I swear to you, there was an article that said, for actors.  Oh, that's me.  Absolutely.  And they said, Paramount Talent Agency. 
[02:29:30]  Paramount Pictures, dude.  That's Eddie Murphy.  That's Eddie Murphy.  And that's at the time, young 80s, it was Eddie Murphy.  I went there.  Dude, I'm not going to lie to you guys either.  It's so gay.  Hey, but I did it and I'm saying I did it.  I show up and the first thing you see is pictures.  Paramount Pictures.  Pictures of movies.  And there's Stallone and there's Julia Roberts.  Wow, this is huge.  And they've got a great skin. 
[02:30:00]  And you sit down and, you know, they're on the phone going, all right, well, you tell Paramount.  We can't do that.  You know, screw Disney.  Because I ain't playing their ball game anymore.  Their lawyers are all, I'm sorry.  Hi.  Hi.  Have you ever thought, I know you're here to act, but have you ever thought of modeling?  Oh.  Oh.  Do you know how much money you can make on one commercial?  How did this happen? 
[02:30:30]  Where did that turn come from?  You look beautiful.  A little more.  Where are the pictures, bro?  Dude, I have to say this.  Where are they, man?  We got to find them.  And I know the guy.  This is what brought back this hard work.  All right, wait.  So you had the pictures taken.  What were you dressed in?  Dude, this is a lot, man.  First of all, I'll tell you.  I'll tell you.  I got no problems.  And if I find it, I got to put it on the website.  Hell yeah. 
[02:31:00]  This dude comes up and he goes, well, that's another thing.  They only work with their own photographers.  Ah.  Oh.  And he's $800.  But here's what you get with the $800.  Right.  You're paying.  A composite has three different pictures of how you look.  Here's the sporty look.  Here's the businessman.  And here's you as an athlete.  This hammer had me.  What a dick.  What a dick.  What were you doing?  D-I-C.  Dick. 
[02:31:30]  I have, I'm not lying to you guys.  I swear on my daughter.  She's so awesome.  I'm next to a locker.  Yeah.  I have a tennis racket.  With your leg up like you just did?  With my leg up.  Way up the stool.  And he's going, all right, make the racket look like you're going to hit it.  Why am I hitting something in the locker room?  But you're happy.  So, I've got the tube socks on and I'm just hanging out.  I need these pictures.  And I was a little chubby.  So, I did like a, you know, 40 push-ups the night before. 
[02:32:00]  Because I had to wear a tank top.  Uh-oh.  So, I got my 40 push-ups.  I'm with them tanked up and hanging with my gym shorts.  I'm going to be a model.  I'm going to work with Eddie Murphy.  I'm going to have a huge career.  Awesome.  Dude, the other picture.  I had to get a suit.  It was embarrassing.  I don't remember the other one.  I don't remember.  I don't remember the other one.  Who cares?  I've got to see this one.  So, now it gets worse.  It's the price of admission, yes?  It gets worse. 
[02:32:30]  So, now I go, $800.  I'm 18 and 19.  A lot of cash.  It's 86.  I just moved to Florida.  Just moved.  Dude, right now it's like asking somebody for a couple of grand.  Dude, I'm stressed if I've got to spend more than 10 bucks on weed at this age.  Right.  I'm like, oh man, I can't get stoned this weekend.  800 bucks.  I only got 12 bucks.  I don't get me, you know, a burger and some weed.  Right.  So, I'm working three shifts. 
[02:33:00]  I'm working morning.  Now, picture that when you're 19.  You've got to get four in the morning to serve breakfast for like $2.  Oh.  I said, you know, he doesn't have a good sense for you.  Nah.  So, I'm working three shifts.  Then they sucker me just when I'm about to make the payment for $800, like three weeks' worth.  They go, you really, you should really think about modeling because Florida is just a metropolis.  A metropolis.  Oh my God.  Los Angeles.  You know Universal Studios is just moving to Orlando?  Ding, ding.  Universal is another word. 
[02:33:30]  Universal Studios.  You have Nickelodeon.  You have Universal.  Oh.  Disney's buying space.  Haribo.  You're going to be filming down here.  Right.  And right now, print ads.  Let me tell you something.  Let me look.  You know, let me get this.  Oh, yeah.  Picture of a little chick.  Now, she isn't even that beautiful.  She made $140,000 last week for 10 minutes.  And you're thinking, that's nice.  Well, what do I got to do?  Right.  You got to go to modeling school.  Oh.  You did not go to modeling school.  I went to the point.  Oh my God.  How much?  How much?  Dude, wait.  Before it even gets. 
[02:34:00]  Wait a minute.  I want to prove to you the power of false images when you're at the entertainment business.  Got ourselves a pretty little baggot.  So check this out.  It gets worse.  It gets worse.  Dude, wait till you see this.  Wow.  This is all coming back to me.  That's great.  And modeling school.  So now I go to the, okay, I go to the modeling school.  Can I interrupt you for a second?  Yeah.  We have audio of.  Oh, screw you.  No, we really do. 
[02:34:30]  Of what?  Of Brewer and Modeling School?  Yeah, Brewer being interviewed for the modeling school.  Pucker up and kiss my ass.  Now, here's the power of Hollywood.  Okay.  I called my friends back in Long Island.  Yeah.  Are you going to kiss my ass or not?  I go, guys, listen, be honest with me.  I'm huge agencies, Paramount, they're hooked up big time, but they want me to go to modeling  school.  You think I can model, right? 
[02:35:00]  Silence for like three minutes.  Of course.  Dude, why don't you give me a call?  Why don't you come up and visit for like three weeks?  How long are you in Florida?  Like three months?  Why don't you come up, man?  You're fagging out.  You're fagging out.  And I'm like, you know what?  Screw you, Long Island dick.  Screw you.  I'm going to be a model.  I hang up, I go, I'll tell you this, I learned that my colors are summer colors.  Dude, how much more than 800 bucks was your modeling school?  It was 450. 
[02:35:30]  Another 450 bucks.  So I paid $1,250.  That's a lot of weeds.  And what did they give you that was going to help you in your career to be a model?  Oh.  Beside the composite picture.  So check this out.  We had to make a commercial.  Oh, no.  We had to make a commercial.  Yeah, I know.  We got audio of the director.  Is that supposed to be sexy?  On your knees. 
[02:36:00]  Where's the girl with the flowers?  Go ahead.  Say I had to make a commercial.  And I did it on, do you remember how huge this was?  Now, you got to remember, I'm still a snapper head.  Is this therapy for you when you come on this show?  I'm just realizing this is great.  You admit a lot of things on this program.  Go ahead.  So I got my hair fluffed out.  I kind of got a mullet, but a cool mullet.  Oh, no.  I got a Long Island mullet.  I still got my cross earring.  I show up, and I do a commercial on Aussie hairspray. 
[02:36:30]  Uh-huh.  Do you remember how huge Aussie hairspray was?  Huge.  Monstrous.  Dude, I'm such a dick.  I got in front of the camera, and I'm like, hello, my name's Ian, and this is Aussie hairspray.  You were doing a bit.  I'm thinking in my mind, I'm like, they see I can talk Australian.  I'm going to be huge.  You're in.  Meanwhile, some guy around Jeremy's with all his porn buddies.  Here's your Aussie hairspray. 
[02:37:00]  Get on your hands and knees like a dog.  That's it.  Fall around like a dog.  This guy confronted me.  I forgot.  That experience was so horrible, I forgot about it.  And I was playing Denver last year, and this guy comes back to the door, and he's like,  um, some guy, Jerry's here.  He said he knew you in Florida.  I go, a lot of people know me in Florida, too.  He comes back five minutes late.  He said, um, you said the guy's uncomfortable? 
[02:37:30]  He said you went to modeling school with him?  Oh, this son of a bitch had to tell the guy?  And I've got to be honest, he has a picture.  I'm just like, I'm a wreck.  It's in the hole!  Oh, no.  So I'm like, all right, go ahead, bring it back, bring it back.  And he did, man.  You are one pathetic loser.  Sorry.  And there it was.  I saw the picture of me and, like, my four, you know, the model guys were hanging out.  Oh, man. 
[02:38:00]  We're going on tour, the model guys.  I've got to see one of these.  New rock.  You've got to get us one of those pictures, man.  We will find it.  This guy definitely has it.  Yeah.  And we have to find my head shot.  I remember the agency and everything.  Yeah.  I have to find, had three pictures.  It was hilarious.  It was horrible.  That's great.  Well, I'm going to go fight a...  Mexican.  No, I'm not going to fight Mexican.  Okay.  I'm going to fight something worse.  Goddamn, I love that.  And with that, we've got to take a break.  Yeah.  You've got to get down to Irving Plaza or no? 
[02:38:30]  Irving.  It's up to you, man.  I'm Irving.  Wow.  Oh, cool.  He's hanging.  Brewer's hanging.  When we get back, we have to play What Do We Learned on the Opinion Anthem.  Yeah, what an educational program.  Because what a mess this was.  I want to see what the people learned out there.  All right, Amber.  All right, we'll do that next.

Nice  Nice  Well, I want to thank you for, you know  Staying to the end of the show, gang  Thanks for letting me hang  A lot of fun today  Because this thing was going nowhere  It was spinning out of control  I like that, though  And by the end  I like it  It was something  I'll tell you  I like when we're right on the cliff like that 
[02:47:00]  We have the chips in control  There was one point  There was one point  I was looking at Anthony  Listening to Brewer  Who was making absolutely no sense  After he came back from Club Stinky  And Anthony was listening  And understanding  And giggling  And I'm like, oh my god  I'm the only sober person here  You were seeing traces at that point  Because of the NyQuil and stuff  I'm taking medicine for this call  That should not be sold over the counter  I don't understand how they sell  I've smoked some weed 
[02:47:30]  My day  I've done some mescaline years ago  I've done some drugs  I've drank  I've done, yeah  We've been there  I've done some stuff  I can compare it on an even keel  With any over-the-counter cold medication  It gives you just as much of a buzz  As if I smoked pot  Or took mescaline  Or anything  I swear to god  This stuff Fs you up  And they sell it in stores  They even call them drug stores  You walk in  You buy drugs 
[02:48:00]  In a drug store  It's amazing  NyQuil  Brewer, you take NyQuil  Brewer, get some  What are you waiting for?  I got it right here, man  I got it right here  You take a swig of this stuff  You take a shot of NyQuil  You know, most people go to sleep on it  They go to bed  They take it at night  You take this stuff in the afternoon  It's a whole new world out there  A whole new buzz  You take it  You know you can't go to sleep  Whole new world  All right  I'll do it again tomorrow  Hey, we got a couple pairs to see  A couple pairs of tickets to see 
[02:48:30]  Jim Brewer  At tomorrow night's show  At Irving Plaza  We'll all be there  Stay on the line  If you're in the New York area  Or Philadelphia area  And we'll give you some tickets  Okay  Anthony, two more before we go  Nathan from the city  Today I learned that you have an employee  At WNEW  Named Stonkey  Yeah, exactly  I forgot about that  Stonkey  And Brewer, this one's for you  Glenn The Tool  I learned that with Jim Brewer  And Stephen Baldwin  They turned Whipping My Wednesdays  Into Weed On Wednesdays  And Brewer's one step closer  To crouching in front of a glory hole  After the faggy stories 
[02:49:00]  He's told today  And then he writes  Nice head  All right, we got to go  Be good, you guys  We'll see you at Irving Plaza  In about an hour, Jim  Thank you  Later  How old are you?  18  All right, what are you showed up?
