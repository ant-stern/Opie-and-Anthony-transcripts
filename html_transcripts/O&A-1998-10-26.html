[04:00]
 everything with them  also congested today what is it an allergy you're saying well i mean you  go with me a while now you know i get these from time to time  your allergies but i can't figure out what it is because uh... i think it's  something i a because it it last for twenty four hours and i'll go through  this whole roll of toilet paper and i'll be fine tomorrow  correct that i'm gonna be a mess today mayoral you haven't been good news is i  took some of the office of the cold medicine yet says right on the package  you know it doesn't cause drowsiness and stuff 
[04:30]
 you know right no heavy machinery should be operated i should not be operating the  any w board here  at this moment in time they should write that that stuff does definitely throws  you for a loop because i'm like loopy right now we had a an interview before  the show with stephan magazine yeah chance he was here  hopes every quote of all these is  that's the i just hope you know spells that right in the interview  kth all of that not sure 
[05:00]
 but we are going to have fun today yeah ugly pride is on the way i i just found  out that robert shim will stop in my air pal that's what i hear we haven't talked  about it while he's a very funny comedian and uh... do you want to hear  the football yesterday  no actually i missed all the game on there's so much excitement yesterday  the jets look great  but then again uh... you know they had a compete against the the birds forty  four-year-old quarterback for the falcons  that was just a mess  i think that experiment uh... 
[05:30]
 wasn't successful for the falcons and  so i thought that they can go with the fourth string quarterback next week  the burgers to get the job done just not working just really did look  uh... good especially on offense  and uh... did you hear about the guy who would uh... set the uh... record for the  longest field goal yesterday and how far was this sixty three yards  at the end of the half of the denver game and you know who used to have the  record at the  uh...  you know you don't know anything about him 
[06:00]
 he's one of my favorite players of all time the guy with the half a foot yes  yeah and see right okay dempsey had like a club for it  but i had no toes  and he had this boot that was like what and then it was just square  and remember you said like half an arm yeah and and he kicked the he has the  record or now he's tied with the record this guy that did it uh... yesterday  that's a good job if you have half a foot sixty three yards  you think i think it'd be easier to kick up a field goal with half a foot  can you get that good flat front working for you right 
[06:30]
 and they don't know the best part of watching dempsey play  you know i was a while like that on jacob has to make a tackle and stuff  here it used to be like  uh... freak show out there he'd be running after the guy with like  a club for it and i have a harmony with still make the tackle  the guy was classic and i look at some of those films it's unbelievable actually  so yeah i was in front of the tb all day as they watch and  watching sports  joints of the week off obviously  and they needed it 
[07:00]
 remove on yeah okay on the way we got some phil collins and uh... we get some  request for days and there we can take care of that as well  facts like two one two nine five seven w any w if you work in  and i was going on the instant feedback no one wants to play with us today on a  monday and a couple stragglers out there  flanking away on their laptop and nothing nothing much w any w dot com and  you can instantly email and they get you must have something to discuss with us  senator and everyone's waiting for ugly bride  are really i guess so we had to get your idea your sunday news days 
[07:30]
 from the recycle bin  and look for the wedding section  where they show the brides and grooms and you can play uh... ugly bride with  us later  there is a lot of uh...  can be a tough one today and there's been a lot of hot he's lately and there's  lots of contenders for this week's ugly bride contest today it's anyone's race  except her she's kind of cute  well let me say  up top  i mean that's not  and i was very nice one of these seven w any w the right in new york with the 
[08:00]
 pretenders  joe jackson before that  and that they're from kentucky  days in the new the downtown it's open at the base of june is out today  say it's a little bit like savings time it  all yeah  that's great  i love this is really good i went outside for lunch just so i can see the  sunset i like it a lot of strength  horrible uh... it's just so depressing isn't it  and we're not used to it yet you know that  but if this was the middle of summer we'd have 
[08:30]
 five hours of daylight still  get out of work ahead of a do whatever you want now i'm looking out the window  behind me that was that the sunrise for tuesday  so they get dark already this is actually the sunrise for tomorrow  i mean has this worked  and i think you're a little confused but you think you close close right  yeah i mean is it like what the the sun's out for what twenty minutes now  that's it we get a quick flash from ten twenty the morning to ten forty i  believe well it is just the beginning of the long downslide that is winter 
[09:00]
 so uh...  yeah it gets dark but now is nothing compared to what it is uh...  another month true a month and a half you start really getting i mean you you  get to work  and it's starting to get dark  when you get home it's pitch black or the sun's coming up like you said  and you know what comes out after it starts getting dark  snow  be the guy there with your little cassette  look at that case  scraping the windshields and  i wish i didn't throw away my ice scraper from last year i know it's a little too early 
[09:30]
 to talk about this but that's what i do every spring i'm convinced you know the last snowfall  i throw my ice scraper away going i'm not going to need this anymore whoops  you know i i usually am prepared with a nice big broom in the back of my truck so i can  just wipe off the snow i'd throw that away every spring as well  but like you said it's it's not near that time yet but this is the first little  inkling  and here it comes  summer is all i look forward to december twenty first 
[10:00]
 because after that then it just starts getting better a little a little bit every day you  could at least start rationalizing that the days are getting a little longer a little  longer but yeah i can't take this anymore because you leave work  it's pitch black  you get out of what five o'clock and stuff and it's just pitch black out  people don't have to drive in the dark so the traffic is worse  it's a mess  there you go leave it the way it was i see no purpose in daylight savings time  yeah i don't either  how did the star  not only franklin i don't give a good idea people to call up and tell us how i don't 
[10:30]
 really care i just want to know where the sun went so the farmers had more daylight  i don't know i i i i i think days out upon manhattan i really uh... relate to  the farmers there was last time we were all were farmers  well see the weaning guy needs more daylight to cook is we need on the  corner fifty seven seven  and they are the way we got a good ride  also i guess we got a plan i was going to try to hold off on planet today but

[20:00]
 training for this big space mission of his that's going down what thursday  yes i'll be the countdown has begun  now why is he going to space  into space  well they say it's uh... to you know test how and  older body functions in weightlessness and space flight  move out by it  i think that this uh... drumming up some uh... interest in the space program  that's it he's like the mark mcguire 
[20:30]
 of space now  he's got to do something you know that has a extraordinary right here  and as far as space travel goes  the biggest thing they could do now is just start putting  people that aren't astronauts up there yeah i mean you know don't get me wrong  i think it's  kind of uh... compelling in a way but uh...  it's going to jury louis telephone  you know in like pledges  are really really down  they start rolling out the kid with just ahead and stuff to get the pledge is up  i i think they need to uh...  built in support of the space program so they're good they're inventing things now 
[21:00]
 like i only met and i don't think  continue with my point here  okay and so  like that's the space program  uh... you know that they they need some interest of okay let's put john glenn  back up into space after that  it'll be like the first paraplegic ever in space how can they get the wheelchair  into the space vehicle how they fashion it down will they be able to adjust  no world to go as freely as the rest of all of that'll be the big thing i haven't 
[21:30]
 our show explaining all that and then after the paraplegic  the first lesbian couple in space all pool and then after that the first  lesbian couple doing a threesome with the paraplegic guy in space  you know they're just inventing things now  justice you know spark of interest is most last time you actually  stay home from school or work to watch a space shuttle go up  i think when they were going to put the first civilian  into space and i was christina maccala those tragic obviously work out too well 
[22:00]
 now but we used to uh... you know blow off work in school stuff to watch this  and now it's like  a plane is taken off at laguardia it's really it's really no one cares  commonplace but if also in the news said hey  you know there's gonna be a monkey uh... you know driving the plane  about what they were got live footage of it  well you want to get it on the same  uh... yeah i would like that that's what i'm getting at the moment is needed to  do you know sparks of interest in the in the space program  probably so they can get more funding down the road well they say this will be 
[22:30]
 the most watched launch  yeah history  obviously the stations will cover the launch  the launch has been covered now by what cnn  pretty much and that's it  channel five still runs the i love louisie reruns and  doesn't matter no one really cares so this did spark some interest and we get  to see walter krong katt again he's all excited because he's got some uh...  attention now once again  all becoming a young bloods with  through the space  and give them a little time past but 
[23:00]
 and i'm going to think i think that they don't believe the most funny but  and i think that  he wanted to be the oldest guy in space yeah who is he kidding he should just  stick to his job he's the oldest man you know  on the yacht  the paper yesterday had some interesting uh... points about this uh... all right  john glenn went in space in nineteen sixty two  the subway at the cost fifteen cents for all it's a lot more expensive now  that's right it's a dollar fifty now and i think i did have to make outrageous 
[23:30]
 when john glenn went into space in nineteen sixty two a movie ticket cost  seventy five sides fantastic our cost you nine bucks to go to a film  this all the stuff you know he could have heard on the wacky dj's show in the  morning i guess they were all hash in the stuff and  guess what a party at grand prix cost back in nineteen sixty two how much would  that have been all played twenty eight hundred dollars act  bail more expensive for new car now  outrageous it would be twenty three thousand dollars today  waxing terrific 
[24:00]
 and guess what the white house crisis back in nineteen sixty two was that i  are able to take a look at how  uh... the the the the  i'm being outrageous close another type of this all  the cuban missile crisis all  today's scandal monocle the west gate  uh...  police facts no one even cares about uh...  you always make a good point about the space program  uh... yeah yeah well uh... 
[24:30]
 it's pretty much a man thing to man thing  although there are there are women astronauts now they'll contrary as  there's a lady going up with john clinton thursday and i i beg to do  what do you mean you beg to differ  and i went to the nasa web page and punched up her picture yeah i couldn't  tell it was a girl and i had a read like up to paragraphs down until it said she  went to this school but ever picture right there don't think you know look  let me say but okay  yes no lady rock settings 
[25:00]
 as a guy  yesterday's  counts  is at  however  approach right  prize  yes book you might like you know what's in it like that immediately  lot  I'm going to say it's a very good name.  Chaki Mukai.  Yeah, very good.  Payload specialist.  Just happens to be a doctor.  You know I think I ate that Saturday night. 
[25:30]
 Went to a sushi restaurant.  Does that not coincide with you thinking John Glenn was going?  Yeah, doctor.  But space programs are pretty much a man driven thing.  Has been since the beginning.  I think, maybe it's just me, it was guys just getting away from their wives.  Maybe I'm wrong, but I think the last time John Glenn was away from his wife was probably  February 20th, 1962. 
[26:00]
 She doesn't want him to go.  No she doesn't.  Which just proves that's probably why he's going.  Just to get away from his wife for a few more minutes.  He just wants a few days alone for once.  It's a miserable life, right?  But these guys, the astronauts, especially the original astronauts back then, I mean  there was no comprehension of what they were doing going into space.  And I don't think the wives understood either.  Especially John Glenn's wife, you know, had never been done before.  He was probably like, hon, I'm going into space. 
[26:30]
 Going to be the first person in space.  First person in orbit.  Oh, hmm.  How many of your friends are going to be in orbit?  In this orbit?  No, honey, you don't understand.  I'm making history.  I am going to be the first man to orbit the earth in outer space.  Any girls in this orbit?  When are you coming back?  You're going to take out the garbage before you go to this orbit? 
[27:00]
 Aren't you?  Is your friend Bob going to be at this orbit?  Last time you went out with him you stayed out all night too.  So how far away is this?  Oh, it's, you know, a few hundred miles in space.  Will you call me?  I better get a phone call.  And leave the checkbook behind.  Yeah, so he's going into space again, I think, to get away from his wife. 
[27:30]
 To get away from his wife.  Simple as that.  All right.  Hope he makes it.  As everybody else has been saying, Godspeed, John Glenn.  Well, actually I think Vegas has odds right now whether or not he's going to survive.  I've heard that too, yeah.  People are betting whether John Glenn is going to live through this flight.  Well, you want to bet a beer?  This is horrible.  I've been such a fan of the space program my whole life.  I'm not going to bet on the life of John Glenn, American hero.  Budweiser. 
[28:00]
 All right, a beer.  Budweiser?  Yeah.  But if he goes the way you said he's going to.  Well, can I pick dead?  Of course, go ahead, pick dead.  Well, I just think like gravity's a bitch and he's going to be up there in space.  Just remember, I'm heavily medicated today.  I just think like his scrotum's going to wrap around his neck and strangle him.  In the weightlessness of outer space, he will be strangled by his own sack, is what you're saying. 
[28:30]
 And if that happens, do I win two beers?  Yeah, oh, if that happens, I'll give you a couple of beers.  We should bet on how he's going to die too.  You are twisted, man.  What? I thought we were just having fun here.  Yeah, we're just having fun.  Now he's in shock.  Take another shot of Nyquil.  All right, so I'm going to go with dead.  Well, I have to go with alive.  I mean, come on.  You've got to hope he makes it back.  Well, I obviously hope he makes it back. 
[29:00]
 But I say it's not too bad.  But a beer would be nice.  The whole launch and everything isn't as rough as they make it in the movies, like all shaky and everything.  Oh, yeah, right.  I say it's pretty smooth.  OK, so there you have it.  On the way, we got Robert Schimel stopping in.  If you got something for the show, 212-757-1027.  1027-WNEW, the rug of New York.

It looks perfect for Halloween though.  It's really starting to look like Halloween.  Yeah.  I don't know.  It puts everyone in the mood.  Yeah.  It puts me in a depressed mood.  I liked it when it was light out.  Halloween's what?  In like three days or something.  It's three days to go out and get some razor blades and apples.

Oh, yeah.  I was going on last night. 
[30:30]
 I had to go on like two times just to clear material for the standards and practices and  sensory.  Oh, really?  What didn't they like?  Well, because last time I was on, last year, I went on and I was in the dressing room.  Conan came in and said, what are you going to open with?  And as a joke, I said, I was at the dentist and I had nitrous oxide for the first time.  I'm sitting there with the mask on and then the dentist comes in and he said, okay, Robert,  you're going to feel a little prick in your mouth.  And I said, I'm going to need a lot more gas before that starts happening. 
[31:00]
 I said, you better turn that all the way up because I either want to love it or not remember  it happened.  Well, that wasn't part of the plan that night.  And...  Whoa, they didn't like that one.  So they censored that one.  That's too bad.  I like that joke.  Yeah.  I was in an office right after my set and they were going, a little prick in the mouth.  Well, you obviously meant a pinch.  I don't understand.  And I said, my dentist says that.  And they go, okay.  But your dentist isn't on prime time.  I don't see the problem at all. 
[31:30]
 I don't get it.  So, that was it.  So then it was one year.  So now, you know, they want me back on.  I have a new CD that just came out on Tuesday.  So, you know, they want me to come on, but I have to behave myself.  Did you go over there already and hash things out with them?  I did some hashing and I've got a couple of shows I've got to do tonight for a little  more hashing.  Some hashing and rehashing before tomorrow.  So, you know, they'll change their mind ten times before tomorrow too.  So you have to do your act in front of some suits and they decide, oh man, that's brutal. 
[32:00]
 Yeah.  It's not funny.  And they're sitting there and they're not getting your humor and stuff because they're  all stuffy.  Yeah.  Oh, you have to be so careful about what you're saying.  You can't mention any product names.  They're afraid that you can.  I do this thing about having a heart attack and I said that, you know, that these are  having angina pain, that these are angina symptoms that show your heart can't handle  the workload.  And I said, workload?  Who are you screwing?  Louie Anderson?  He said, Louie Anderson is another guy. 
[32:30]
 That's what makes it fun.  Jesus.  He said, maybe if you say Roseanne.  And I said, I'm not going to say Roseanne.  People are going to boo.  If you say Roseanne, they're going to go, oh.  But Louie, I mean, you know.  No one likes to pick on Louie, too.  I remember I was with Louie once.  I think it was in Montreal at the Comedy Festival.  How did your heart do?  And I said, you know, I said, Louie, you're so big. 
[33:00]
 I said, how can anybody do it with you?  I said, you know, for somebody to go down on you, they'd have to lay across like two  chairs face down and have somebody roll underneath like on those things that car mechanics use.  And he looked at me and said, you got it all worked out already.  Louie's just a mess.  That's because my father beat me all the time.  He's always bitching about his childhood.  I never found him that funny. 
[33:30]
 My parents were nice to me and I couldn't write a book about it because nobody would  want to buy that book.  You need to be beat for good reading.  That's what's going to sell.  It's true.  It's horrible.  That's why I was telling somebody today, you know, they said, you know, you got to watch  out when you go on TV and radio and you can't be obscene.  And what's on the cover of the USA Today?  The baseball players just signed a thing for 91 million dollars.  That's pretty obscene.  That's more obscene than 30,000 dollars a year.  I mean, how many teachers and cop salaries add up to 91 million? 
[34:00]
 Pretty much all of them.  The whole force.  The whole force in New York.  You're expecting to be protected by somebody that's getting 30 grand.  They got to go knock on somebody's door, not knowing if there's somebody with a shotgun  on the other side and someone else is playing balls getting 91 million.  There you go.  Well, it wouldn't work.  You know, Piazza running in going freeze, drop it.  I'm a ball player.  Yeah.  Throw your gun over here.  A great catch.  That gun just a bit outside, but picked up by Piazza. 
[34:30]
 One oh two seven WNEW, the Rock of New York with Golden Earring.  You're hanging with Opie and Anthony and Robert Schimmel.  He's going to be on Conan tomorrow night.  That's right.  We've been discussing a lot of topics as Golden Earring was playing.  We were discussing John Glenn.  How do you feel about John Glenn going back into space, Robert?  I think it's a publicity stunt definitely.  Thank you.  That's what we said.  And just a way to get away from his wife probably.  Because he's probably sitting around pontificating about what it was like to be in the space  program and his wife's going, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[35:00]
 So he's going to go up and like he's going to be, you know, it's going to be like the  way I look at it is the only way I can relate to it is it's like being on one of Rodney  Dangerfield's young comedians.  John Glenn's like Rodney and he gets to have his first time astronauts go up with him.  Anthony thinks he looks like the turtle from Bugs Bunny.  Well, because they're all wearing the space suit and it looks fine on everybody else.  But then you just see that old head poking out of the top of it. 
[35:30]
 It's like when you put the old guy behind the cut out of the muscle man.  You put his head there.  It looks just like that.  And his head looks like the turtle from the Bugs Bunny cartoon.  I'm going to beat the red.  Kind of all crunchy in there in the neck.  Yes, we get the job done.  I hope that everything's OK.  I think anything happens to that launch man.  He's the one that's going to get all the publicity.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Well, he'll be the one getting his own stamp and the rest of them you don't know their  names. 
[36:00]
 He died a hero with those other guys.  So that'd be tragic.  We're also talking about censorship because a lot of the jokes that you want to do, you're  not going to be able to do on Conan tomorrow night.  Yeah.  Do you want to give us another joke on our show that they will not see on Conan tomorrow?  Hmm.  Yeah, that is a delay, by the way, if that's what you're looking at.  We do have an escape hatch, if need be.  You do?  Well.  Oh, no.  I just gave him a loaded gun. 
[36:30]
 No, no, no.  I'm trying to think of what would be a good one that I can't do on there.  You can't say anything with, you can't say in and ass in the same sentence no matter  what it is.  Right.  I saw an ass in the circus.  You can't say that.  They go nuts.  Or you can't say butt and in.  You can't say in and butt. 
[37:00]
 You can't say, well, we went in, but.  And they go, no.  That goes to show you where their minds are.  I know.  Oh, here's where it was.  I said I went to a gym and the guy said, hey, you know, after a workout there's nothing  like a nice Jacuzzi.  And I look at some of the people in Jacuzzi and I said, I'm not getting in there unless  I have a condom on and a cork in my ass.  Because I don't know them and I don't want any of that water going in and opening.  And they go, oh, no, you know, people could take that the wrong way.  What?  Wrong way?  There's only one way. 
[37:30]
 Yeah.  You can't say cork in.  I said you can say on.  A cork on my ass?  That doesn't work.  Not at all.  Now, you know, the Virgin Mary might be appearing tomorrow.  That's right.  You were telling me.  I was on a trailer on a couple blocks away from the Heldman.  I said the Virgin Mary is going to appear in New York.  With my luck, it will be just when I'm hitting the stage on Conan.  They're going to cut to a live remote with the Virgin Mary and they're going to come  back just as the audience is clapping and Conan's going to say, that's the best set we've ever  had on the show.  Thanks for coming in, Robert. 
[38:00]
 You might get the spillover audience.  People are like, oh, we could see the Virgin Mary anytime.  Yeah, she's doing two shows tonight.  Two shows.  Two drink minimum with the Virgin Mary.  She's been doing a late show.  There you go.  Anything else on your mind, Robert?  Oh, I have a, I got a computer for my daughter.  She just went to college and she asked me if I could hook her up for the internet because  that way she could do homework and stuff.  So, you know, I go on America Online and the first thing I did was go on the lesbian chat  lounge and I'm in there for like two seconds and all of a sudden all these people come 
[38:30]
 on.  It's amazing.  And by the way, if you guys go on, I'm Susie 553, which means there's 552 other guys named  Susie before me.  No, it's amazing.  Because one of my friends said, oh, you never tried cyber sex.  It's really cool, you know?  Yeah, it's really great.  You know, I go in there, some girl goes, hey, want to have a threesome?  You, me and this other guy meet me in this chat room.  And then I'm in there and she goes, you know, I'm performing on the internet.  I'm performing oral sex on you.  He's doing a doggy style.  You grab my breasts. 
[39:00]
 I'm doing this.  I said, I can't do it with you anymore.  I have carpal tunnel syndrome.  I wanted to go, why don't you just do him while I go get some asper cream?  I'll be back in a few minutes.  And then I see this one chat room that says, are you curious?  And it's like, well, I am now.  I want to know it.  I go in there and a picture of this guy's thing pops up on the screen.  I'm not that curious.  Now I'm only curious about how to get it off my hard drive.  I'm afraid I'm going to have a heart attack.  They're going to find me dead with that on my computer.  That's how my kids are going to remember that.  That you're not going to hear on Conan, definitely. 
[39:30]
 There's too many on's and ends in there.  All right, so Conan, tomorrow night.  And what's the name of the CD?  If you buy my CD, I can get this car.  It's me sitting in a Porsche Boxster.  It really was going to be called, if you buy my CD, I can get this Porsche.  But then Warner said we didn't get permission from Porsche to use their name.  And I said, but it's free advertising for them.  He said, they don't need you to sell cars.  They're selling lots of them without you.  I should have picked like Hyundai or something.  There you go.  They'd have been happy.  They'd have given me one.  Hyundai Tiburon.  All right, Anthony, we need to talk about MindSpring really fast here. 
[40:00]
 All right, Internet Service.  It's a very cool Internet Service.  If you're in the market for a new service, you might want to check out MindSpring,  1-888-M-Spring.  They've got something that I really like, fast, reliable, 56K connections.  That's a problem when you sign up with other companies.  You get 288.  Well, you got the lower.  Yeah, you got the 56K modem and you're hoping for the 56K hookup.  And a lot of times you just don't get it.  What good is that?  But MindSpring takes care of that problem.  They got lots and lots of 56K connections. 
[40:30]
 Also, they got free customer support 24 hours a day, seven days a week, toll free.  So you want to hear this.  Here we go.  Busy signal.  All our operators are presently busy.  Please stay on the line for the next available operator.  Which could be Wednesday afternoon.  Yeah, exactly.  This call cost you $2 a minute.  Now keep holding, please.  We need more money.  So they got excellent service and support.  You can get ahold of them pretty easily. 
[41:00]
 Call MindSpring toll free at 1-888-M-Spring and tell them Opie and Anthony sent you.  This is a little extra bonus here.  MindSpring will waive the $25 startup fee and give you the first 30 days of service free from the day you sign up.  Hey, a little treat for the faithful listeners later on this hour when you hear Pump It Up by Elvis Costello.  Be the 10th caller at 212-757-1027 and you'll get the Rolling Stone CD, the live one.  No security.  Giving that away all afternoon long here on the Opie and Anthony show.  1027 WNEW, the rock of New York. 
[41:30]
 It's Opie and Anthony.  WNEW brings you REM in concert this coming Wednesday night at midnight.  So keep that in mind and their new CD Up will be released tomorrow.  I read a few reviews in the paper over the weekend on the REM album and it's getting very mixed reviews at this point in time.  Really?  There's no real hooks.  Like the reviewers need hooks.  I think REM Music is a band that has their fans and I don't think they're getting many new people in. 
[42:00]
 Not lately anyway.  No.  But I like the new song we're playing.  You're an REM fan, right?  Yeah, I'm a big REM fan and I don't mind the new song at all.  Sounds a lot like night swimming but it's cool.  Okay.  And tomorrow I'm going to pick up Up and I'll check out the rest and I'll tell you what I think about it.  You do that.  Also being released tomorrow, FISH, their latest CD is going to be out tomorrow.  Groovy.  The Story of the Ghost, first studio album in two years.  And Dream Theater, once in a lifetime, first live album from these progressive rockers. 
[42:30]
 All right.  That'll be out tomorrow as well in your favorite record store.  What about Motley Crue's new album coming out?  Who's new album coming out?  They're putting out the greatest hits album, Opie.  You know how I learned that?  How?  Last night I'm flipping through the channels.  WWF Wrestling is on.  Guess who's playing at a WWF Wrestling event last night?  Motley Crue.  Is that about when you go, over?  What happened to wrestling?  Dunski.  What happened to wrestling? 
[43:00]
 I was a big wrestling fan.  Well, it's turned into a big soap opera now.  Yeah.  From what I can tell.  I mean, it's kind of cool that they got the bodacious babes, but besides that, it's kind of goofy now.  For the most part now, they got these ridiculous storylines like a soap opera, and it's not really about the wrestling anymore.  There's no more slobs anymore.  No more like, you remember this stiff?  They'd have the big guy that came in, like your Hulk Hogan type guy.  Yeah.  And all right, he's just wrestling a slob today.  Yeah.  And the guy comes out in a real wrestling attire. 
[43:30]
 Sure.  And it's like Mike from Brooklyn.  Yeah.  All right, he's going to do it.  He starts beating up Hulk.  And you're like, oh my God, is Mike from Brooklyn actually going to beat the Hulkster?  Of course.  Then Hulk would throw him down.  But those days are over.  Now everyone is a superstar.  Yes.  And they're all like huge.  Yeah.  And they fight each other.  And it doesn't matter who wins or loses because these belts that they have just go from one guy to the other.  I lost interest when Vince McMahon decided he wants to wrestle again.  Well, that's what I see now is Vince is very involved in what's going on. 
[44:00]
 Yeah.  Stone Cold Steve Austin put the smack down on his ass.  And that's the bottom line because Stone Cold said so.  I mean, one episode I saw, Vince was in the hospital after receiving a bad leg injury.  And Stone Cold went in disguised as a doctor and stuck something in Vince's butt.  Yeah.  Like an enema thing.  Yeah, that's going to hurt you. 
[44:30]
 And they just happened to have video of this.  Oh, yeah.  That's the camera just happened to be in the hospital.  What happened to the old days?  Andre the Giant fighting three guys that were under five foot tall.  And he would stack them up three high.  Yeah.  Sit on top of them.  And that would be the end of the match.  Mr. Fuji.  Mr. Fuji.  With the dust he used to throw in the guy's eyes.  Oh my God.  For the hundredth match in a row, he's going to throw the dust in the guy's eye.  Oh, why did the ref ever see the dust?  Why?  Why?  He used to get ticked off at the refs. 
[45:00]
 What about Ernie Ladd?  Yeah, the good old day.  Ernie Ladd the cat.  He used to be with the Dallas Cowboys.  He went into wrestling and he had a thumb injury for 12 years.  For 12 years?  Something like that.  Yeah, he had to wear something on his thumb and he used to jab it in the people's eyes.  Yeah, of course.  Those were the days.  Why did they allow him to do that every time?  I don't understand.  The Iron Sheik.  Yeah.  I liked Ivan Putsky.  The Polish hammer. 
[45:30]
 I think there's a new Putsky or something.  Is there?  Is that supposed to be related to Ivan?  I don't know.  I don't know about that.  I just know now it's a big soap opera.  It's not like it used to be.  And Chief Jay Strongbow.  You have a great story.  What?  About when he turned bad?  I was so depressed as a kid.  I think it was a tag team match with Bruno Sammartino.  And they're winning.  Bruno and Chief Jay and all of a sudden Chief Jay comes running in the ring with the chair  and knocks Bruno out. 
[46:00]
 Oh my God.  Chief Jay Strongbow is now a bad guy.  I didn't know that happened.  I was so bummed.  He hates you, buddy.  Yeah, wrestling.  How did we get on wrestling?  We were talking about new CDs and we got on to wrestling.  Oh, Motley Crue was playing at the wrestling.  They really were?  Yeah, they got up and played a song.  And like, you know, I think they said in a couple of days they're going to be live again at a wrestling event.  Like they're going to get into it.  Guaranteed it gets to the point where Vince Neil is in the ring or something. 
[46:30]
 Or Tommy Lee pulling out his huge penis move or something.  They're going to call him the Strangler.  He's talking to him.  He's using the Strangler.  Oh my God.  I'm finding this funny.  If you're playing at wrestling matches, that's only one step above playing in malls.  Yeah, it's done.  I mean, they filled arenas when it was Motley Crue.  They played to a full arena, but it was a wrestling crowd. 
[47:00]
 And that's the bottom line.  1027WATW, the Ryke of New York, Jimi Hendrix, Blind Melon and Elvis Costello, Pump It Up.  That was the song you had to be listening for for the Rolling Stones live CD, No Security, and Ross Latera of New Jersey.  All Jersey winners today, it looks like.  What part?  What part of Jersey?  Freehold, man.  All right.  Is that near you, Matt?  No, that's where Bruce lives.  I know it's where Bruce lives.  I thought you live near Bruce.  It's way down there.  Oh, OK.  Sorry. 
[47:30]
 All right.  You got more of these CDs, giveaway?  All right.  I'm a little slow today.  I've been spacing.  Well, you took that cold medication, so we survived.  We survived the show.  I went through a whole roll of toilet paper, too.  I'll be fine tomorrow, Anthony.  I think we had some fun today, though.  Yeah, we did.  I had fun.  I was in space like John Glenn's going to be on Thursday.  Let me see the roll of toilet paper.  Right here.  Wow, you did go through a lot.  Just about all of it.  Amazing.  That's the only stuff that could go in those two areas. 
[48:00]
 It's true.  What else are you going to use?  Sandpaper?  No, I mean, it's the only thing you would use for both areas.  That's so not true.  What else?  I use my sleeve all the time for my nose.  And then you use it for the other area?  My sleeve?  Oh, my God, he's a retard today, too.  It's toilet paper, my friend.  So what else do you use toilet paper for?  Your nose and all, all, all, all.  You're using your sleeve for that? 
[48:30]
 Can I help you?  I think you misunderstood him.  I did misunderstand him.  He said it's the only product you can use for both areas, your nose and the other.  Right, and I said, no, I use my sleeve for my nose.  That's another product.  So if you would use your sleeve for your butt, too, then it would work.  I see, I see.  I told you I'm a little slow today.  Wow, you know something, kids?  Go out and buy some Alka-Seltzer cold medicine if you want to be as wacky as Opie today.  Yeah, and they say that it doesn't make you drowsy or spacey.  You're right.  You drove in today, too, didn't you?  Clear the field, people. Clear the field. 
[49:00]
 Clear the highway. Highways and byways.  All right, you want to end with something silly today?  Very silly, sure.  All right, a track from our Demanded World CD.  You know, the one you can't get in New York.  Exactly, so we figured we should at least play some of these on the air.  Yeah.  That's the only way you're going to hear it because I think one guy this weekend found it after going to 20 record stores.  Right? Isn't that what you got?  That's the email I got. </pre>
