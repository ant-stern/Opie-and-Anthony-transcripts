<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show began with Opie and Anthony engaging in vulgar self-deprecating humor and discussing popular mobile games like "Angry Birds" and "Train Yard."  Anthony then recounted a road rage incident where he deliberately blocked a paparazzo's car near the "Today" show set after the photographer double-parked, causing a significant traffic jam.  The incident involved a heated confrontation, insults, and boasts of damage to the paparazzo's vehicle.  The show then transitioned to a discussion of "Baby Klaus," an infant with hydrocephalus, eliciting shock, morbid humor, and insensitive comments from the hosts regarding the baby's appearance and the parents.  Pictures of Baby Klaus were shown.  The segment concluded with Opie expressing anxiety about giving Ozzy Osbourne a birthday gift – multiple Beatles-themed books –  due to concerns about Ozzy already owning them.  The hosts announced a sold-out Atlantic City show and the addition of a second performance.

The next segment focused heavily on the 18-pound Beatles book gift for Ozzy.  The hosts weighed the books on air, extensively discussed Ozzy's potential reaction, and considered alternative gifts, including a Pet Rock.  They speculated on Howard Stern's approach to a similar situation and explored various inappropriate gift-giving scenarios.  Jimmy's large photoshopped picture with Ozzy (with a security guard removed) was discussed, along with photo editing techniques. A prank call pretending to be Ozzy increased Jimmy's anxiety.  The hosts also discussed Regis Philbin's behavior towards Nicki Minaj and played a bizarre earthquake prediction by Frankie McDowell. A listener called to question Jimmy's gift choice. Sam was present in the studio throughout. The segment ended with Jimmy still stressed and discussion of upcoming live shows.

The show continued with discussions of Eddie Vedder's *Into the Wild* soundtrack, one host's elaborate Christmas light display installed by Mexican workers, and the perceived differences between Christmas and Hanukkah, using humorous and offensive stereotypes.  They criticized NFL player fines, LeBron James (comparing him unfavorably to Michael Jordan), and discussed candle preferences. A caller sang an offensive Christmas song, prompting further irreverent jokes. A call to a friend in Israel further explored Hanukkah/Christmas differences.  They also critiqued a woman who defended herself against a subway perv and analyzed Arizona Cardinals quarterback Derek Anderson's post-game press conference. The segment concluded with mention of an upcoming Ozzy Osbourne interview and the 18-pound book gift, followed by a brief interview with Jay Moore.

Jay Mohr called in, discussing his upcoming shows and Rich Voss's combative Twitter feed, fake celebrity Twitter accounts, and online hate. He shared a funny anecdote about Clint Eastwood.  Ozzy Osbourne then appeared in studio, receiving the Beatles-themed gifts.  The conversation covered Ozzy's album's chart performance, current band, experiences in Brazil, genealogy test revealing Neanderthal DNA, upcoming shows, relationship with Sharon Osbourne, lifestyle, viewing habits (true crime shows and documentaries), dealing with fans, encounters with other musicians (including Paul McCartney and Gordon Lightfoot), the challenges of a long-term public relationship, and his candid views on sex and infidelity. Ozzy joked about his TV preferences, and the show transitioned to music.

A later segment featured further conversation with Ozzy, including a story about inadvertently using a similar melody to a Paul McCartney song and receiving a gracious letter in response.  They discussed Ozzy's career, public recognition, and upcoming shows. Jim Norton recounted a humorous anecdote about his girlfriend and presented Ozzy with a Barnes & Noble gift card with an awkwardly phrased message.  The comedic highlight was Ozzy leaving behind the signed books and gift card given to him, prompting laughter and disbelief. The hosts filmed this, calling it both the saddest and funniest thing they’d ever seen. The segment concluded with discussion of Ozzy's appearance and the abandoned gifts, mentioning a Panasonic Multiflex Shaver commercial.

[00:27:30]  uh this poor little fella oh we're doing the same thing but at least we openly admit it  right veins on his skull like my grandma's legs yeah now if his head is shrunk by whatever method  will he ever be like a regular kid i probably retarded why do you think retarded because you  can't have a brain that has that much fucking fluid on it without damaging the brain is that the brain  or is that fluid between the skull and the skin then they just pop it like a blister i'm thinking  no that's that's inside so the skull's that big yeah yeah well baby skulls you know they're they're 
[00:28:00]  all they're not attached right that's probably eight times the size of the body though yeah you're  saying that that's in his brain that's fluid in like uh really yeah probably in between like that  little membrane let's go back to the story because because the news has to be serious and tell us about  this uh condition waterhead that's a little bit of water untreated hydrocephalus has created a  terrible problem cerebrospinal all right oh come on not the proud papa picture come on why is he 
[00:28:30]  yeah it's not even i look i understand i don't know i mean how do you what do you say about that the  poor guy danny can you can you please i gotta tweak that's his father that's claus's father he's  holding clouds and he's not smiling he's smiling a little smile because i don't mean to laugh but  the father is doing the proud papa photo he's kind of smiling but all right i'll send this out what 
[00:29:00]  he wants to do is just scream oh my god what and punch his wife in the vagina for its ineptness  did they do a one fucking sonogram on this thing what do they think the baby was on a hoppity hop in  there that's sonic jesus oh my god i gotta all right uh go ahead i'm sorry oh the poor guy is  just like i mean here he is with dear old dad yeah oh eyes doctors in el paso were unable and in 
[00:29:30]  some cases unwilling to try and help his eyes are gone his family turned to university hospital  and pediatric neurosurgeon dr david jimenez for help it is nothing that i've seen before  dr jimenez rushed baby claus to the operating room where he put in a drain to slowly relieve the  deadly pressure this is something that probably is going to take weeks maybe over a month maybe  longer beer tap on his head to the point of that we're comfortable for a foamy one put in a permanent 
[00:30:00]  shunt the family is praying for a miracle for claus who may end up blind deaf disfigured or disabled he  faces a long road to recovery and extensive surgery for the first time though his family has hope what  i can tell about my son is that uh a great fighter a warrior he's stable he's doing much better  ever since he arrived in the hospital a week ago of course he's stable he can't move moving more he's  more interactive my hope is that uh he's going to be as normal as we can possibly get him as we can 
[00:30:30]  possibly get him never baby claus's head is already nearly a foot smaller for his parents who were  told that he wouldn't live long after birth just getting to this point is a relief why would you  and again when does that happen like when does it happen where you have to make the decision do we  continue with the pregnancy or is this something that happened like late in the pregnancy with nothing  you can do maybe they have one of those uh one of they're one of those very religious families 
[00:31:00]  that those asshole families never will never get an abortion no matter what so when they found out  that's a great sound clip hey we got a water head we'll get one of those abortions  will the baby ever have uh like a a normal existence or a quality of life no the thing look it's got no  eyeballs it had no eyeballs how do you know there were no eyeballs maybe they were tucked away somewhere in  there in the water you think they're bobbing around like ice cubes in a drink 
[00:31:30]  let's go to joey in m in maryland joey hey what's up guys hey buddy hey congratulations you've  given birth the mega mind i know yeah publicity i hate to take this next call but it is a good line  uh lady trucker what's up my good  good fucking morning opie that baby looks like one of those angry birds it does look like the big  fat angry bird that really does a lot of damage that smashes the big red angry bird the big angry 
[00:32:00]  bird it looks like the uh the angry bird that drops the egg that's the egg that's good though  that's terrible  so that's uh baby klaus or baby klaus just fucking you know the the there's a couple things going on  here why would the parents allow the media to do a whole story on it and and and allow pictures  out there the guy sounded like uh one of them uh foreign types yeah probably doesn't understand the  whole thing of the vultures that are uh the media so when when somebody from the hospital went out and 
[00:32:30]  went hello yeah we have a monster here you want you might want to get your cameras in here uh they  probably you know with open arms going oh look it'll expose the baby to to people and maybe get  some help nathan i i hate that i have to read some of these today nathan writes gotta love that  throw rug hairdo oh god yeah the head's so big it just outgrew the hair the little patch where the

[00:34:30]  a buildup of fluid it's snow it builds up the back of the skull and the brain will pump but it  can only pump so much in through the mother's heart and fallopian tubes and uh he's gonna have a long  road ahead of him if he's gonna get better but uh it's possible fluid drainage uh there's gonna be  seepage into the uh the mother's system the cervix oh that's uh that's a good idea you could just put  like a big um yankees hat on him and rest him in the rear deck of your car why he looks like he 
[00:35:00]  should be driving the pictures out in shea stadium it's mr met yes it's a mascot i paint his head with  some stitching now i don't even know if oh god i don't even know if this reference is going to be  good but walt in jersey go ahead i don't remember this i'm i'm just i'm just assuming i want to talk  to my son i'm just assuming you got a great reference here walt go ahead i'm going blind on  this one what's up greg james and anthony hello what's up walt uh yeah if you go old gaming system

[00:36:00]  well i didn't get that huge but uh it was treated when i was three months old and i was taking care of  back then and that was 50 years ago you still got the little tube yeah the little tube is long gone  but did but did were your eyes like rolled back like this kids are that's how they found out that  i had it what is now that red we're seeing where his eyes are is that like when a kid will pull down  the bottom of his eyes and look up it looks like that's what you're seeing from the pressure i have 
[00:36:30]  no idea i have no idea i would look into what i had if i had it yeah no kidding i would want to know  everything about it jimmy is uh bringing up the eddie spaghetti with the meatball eyes syndrome  which my bus driver used to do uh eddie spaghetti with the meatball eyes was my bus driver and he  would flip his eyelids up and the bottom ones down and every time he'd go to a bus stop he'd open the  door and we'd have to walk in and go good morning eddie spaghetti with the meatball eyes and we'd all  laugh or be horrified that was he would do that and then he would all we would touch our penises 
[00:37:00]  yeah i want to know what eddie spaghetti did but i want to know if you ever smelled the  fucking driver's seat of the bus while eddie spaghetti was fucking your crybaby bottom  and all you all you smell is his fart-coated bus driver's seat  i hated eddie spaghetti yeah he used to have to get on every morning and watch his stupid eyelid trick  i bet eddie spaghetti would pick anthony up and kiss his stomach and go  anthony would pretend to giggle i wish i'd have cried 
[00:37:30]  um someone is saying that this kid is 11 months old that he wasn't born this way yeah what parent  allows this to get out of control can you read that story again no way no i couldn't that's  couldn't be 11 months old baby yeah he is 11 months they just let his head fucking inflate  what'd they think untreated he wasn't born that way  oh i mean i'm pretty sure it was you want to talk about bad parents just take him to the gas  station i think it's just 
[00:38:00]  who else would just think of that sound effect so great  a piece of total piece of  shit  oh that's funny uh god take care of your kid 11 months and his head is like that 
[00:38:30]  that is something that should be taking care of it don't try to get back in god's good graces  trying to take care of things the child needs help well it is infuriating  the size of his head sam they were combing his hair with a rake sam they could have done something  his nickname was head mcgillicuddy  his father would pick him up like a bowling ball  poor little fuck yeah that's terrible man it really is 
[00:39:00]  it sounds like it's infuriating that the parents didn't do anything about it well if they were born  in texas let me say and the father sounds like that were they are you talking some kind of mexico  thing going on here the article says that the kid was born like that but they were some doctors  refused to like yeah they just knew that it wasn't going to end well  at all you just so i think i think the 11 months has just been them trying to find someone who's  going to help that's actually going to help doctors won't touch the kid what a piece of 
[00:39:30]  shit profession yeah like they do something then he dies and like they pop it and his head goes  and the kid flies all over the room where he floats away like a balloon  old helium head yeah it's old hindenburg head what a noggin  oh my god that's baby klaus put baby klaus good old baby klaus that stinks  kid huh huh geez it's a fucking dumb kid whatever that's terrible yeah all right yeah that was nice uh

[00:40:30]  even cute with a big head how could you be cute well push that thing around the giant stroller you  gotta put ballast on the bottom of the stroller so it don't capsize  see if stroller has a giant keel on it like a sail ship  you can't help yourself no i can't i'm just thinking of little situations put that monstrosity 
[00:41:00]  in you know how many awkward moments he's gonna have growing up well like if he's doing something  stupid that teaches you to say use your look you might want to rethink this unless he gets a job  as a with a wrecking company there you go it's worth it use your head  oh would he be the first cop through the door every time call the battering ram  poor little fella yeah ben in minnesota someone should hit it with a stick to get the candy out

[00:48:00]  baby klaus with a justin bieber wig on that'd be great i know look fantastic that'd be a lot of hair  though oh yeah that'd be huge like just a huge tube a little toupee on it there's so like a bunch  of toupees together it'll be all discolored speaking of hair problems uh tom brady might  have some hair problems we'll talk about that after oh yes he might be uh going in for some um  treatment that doesn't make sense whatsoever but really we'll we'll try to dissect that 
[00:48:30]  shit too stay there  oh for anthony this is your song anthony i thought it was um for ozzy for jimmy 
[00:49:00]  Oh, that's true, too.  If you're just tuning in, Ozzy Osbourne's going to be here at 940.  And Jimmy got him a birthday gift that Ozzy will have to open live on our show.  Yeah, we just found this out because it's Ozzy's birthday.  When is his birthday?  December 3rd.  Right.  We all know your obsession with Ozzy Osbourne.  I call it an obsession.  I've got to ask you this.  True.  Who's your second favorite celebrity?  It's got to be Gene.  Oh, okay.  Gene Simmons, right? 
[00:49:30]  No, I actually do love Gene because, you know, again, I grew up loving him.  I would say...  But Ozzy's number one by far.  Oh, God.  The only person Ozzy would take a backseat to would probably be Pryor.  But, you know, he's dead.  But I would say Pryor of all time first and then Ozzy.  Yeah, because Pryor kind of dictated where my life went.  You know, it was a little bit different.  But right now, hard to say, man.  I love a lot of people.  Like, I love De Niro.  I mean, as much as I've teased him about his dumb public speaking, I love the guy. 
[00:50:00]  Fuck, hard to say, bro.  I know.  Hard to say.  That's why I'm saying it.  Because Ozzy's, like, number one by far.  And now we got the douche chills of watching him open up a birthday gift from you.  There is a part of me that was tempted to back out and not do it because I bought, like I said, I went to one place and I got a birthday.  Something I thought he would like, which was kind of simple.  Right.  But then I just got two because I'm like, they didn't have really good ones there.  But then I went to another place and they had what I wanted. 
[00:50:30]  But this is an item that's not really good to be returned.  So I was kind of the other two I had gotten.  Is it bad that I want this to fail miserably?  Oh.  It probably will.  Oh.  I'm just asking.  Poor little fella.  It probably will fail.  It can't really fail, though, because my girlfriend told me I should get a gift bag.  Oh.  And I'm like, maybe I should get a gift bag.  Yeah.  Did you obsess about this then after she said that?  No, but the thing, the bag, she knows I'm so full of shit because I had the bags. 
[00:51:00]  I had, I'm like, you know what?  Where are these presents?  They're in the office.  We're going to bring them in now.  And they're wrapped?  Yeah, but they wrap them at the store.  But I'm like, why not?  I have photos of them, though.  I don't want to know what it is.  Oh, you don't?  Did you tell Anthony?  Yes, I showed him pictures.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And?  I know.  I got my opinions.  I'll keep them to myself.  You think they're terrible?  No, no.  I don't think they're terrible.  At all.  I don't. 
[00:51:30]  What is your opinion then?  It's hard for me to say without, like, blowing up the spot.  Okay.  Yeah.  Is there problems?  Potential problems?  Potential problems.  I'll just say potential problems.  Would it be him having it already?  Could be.  I thought of that.  Either him having it or him having something so much better.  Well, that is like, that is clearly like it.  But imagine like that. 
[00:52:00]  I thought, you know what?  I thought of that, too.  There's certain.  Oh, thank you.  So obviously you know what they are.  Well, not necessarily.  They're extremely heavy.  Hand it to Anthony.  Let Anthony see how much.  Wait, wait.  Ozzy's not going to carry this out of here.  No, Ozzy won't.  Tony Dennis will.  His assistant.  His assistant.  Yeah, let Opie feel how heavy they are.  You've got Ozzy heavy gifts. 
[00:52:30]  Oh, my God.  Oh, shit.  He's going to hate them.  I'm just wondering if, you know, that could be awkward.  Why?  Just if, you know, he already has.  Well, I thought of that.  That's why I got two.  Oh.  But then when I got two and went to the other place, they had better ones.  Like, that's.  Had I gotten to this other place first, I would have got him just one thing.  Will you be okay if he shows that he doesn't give a crap about your gifts?  Oh, no. 
[00:53:00]  Yeah, of course.  Okay.  I just.  Dude, I don't expect him to go ballistic.  It's more.  And then I was like, I told my girlfriend, like, you know what?  I was going to bring two back.  But then I'm like, I don't know if you can return books.  And she goes, oh, shut up.  He just wanted to give him more presents.  Oh.  I was waiting.  I knew someone would step on the landmine at some point.  That's perfect.  I was just waiting with all this tiptoeing going on that somebody was going to say.  Oh, I'm so stupid. 
[00:53:30]  I'm glad it was you, though.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But how could the books be better?  Well, I might as well say it.  Now you can just say it.  Hopefully I'm just not doing it.  I'm sure you're not listening.  Wait, were you going to say it?  I literally did not mean to say that.  I was kind of going through my process of why I didn't bring him back.  Hey, you know they're books.  Should we say what kind of books?  Let's just say they're books about a certain personality that apparently Ozzy likes that  I'm just thinking, wow, Ozzy might have these, but not only have them, might actually have 
[00:54:00]  them signed.  Well, we know two of them.  Like, yeah.  So it's like, so it could be like, what are the books?  Well, I said, here's the thing.  What would I like?  When I've gotten stuff from fans, I've gotten some weird gifts from fans, but the stuff  they'd give me on Sabbath.  No, no, AIDS.  That was a gift I gave back.  There you go.  A gift that keeps on giving.  Exactly.  It certainly is.  Think of me every time you tighten up that belt loop, Sonny.  Missy, I mean.  Very good question. 
[00:54:30]  George Brooks from Atlanta writes, would Jimmy report Ozzy if Ozzy raped him?  That's a very good question.  That's a great question.  The tree's going into Rockefeller Center?  No, it's being lit up tonight.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Then why are they showing old footage?  I don't know.  That's...  They're lighting the tree tonight?  Yeah.  Hmm.  All right, go ahead.  So...  Sorry.  I'm finishing my eggs.  Mmm.  Delicious.  So stuff that I've liked that I've gotten has been Sabbath-oriented stuff or Ozzy-oriented 
[00:55:00]  stuff.  That's kind of cool.  Yeah.  So I'm like, what would Ozzy like?  I just wanted to give him one little thing.  And I'm like, something on the Beatles, because he's a Beatles fan.  Can't give him the music, because he owns the fucking music, and he's met McCartney and  Ringo.  He can't...  Wait a minute.  So they have great...  I'm like, a great photo book.  That's what I would like if I was him.  Somebody's to give me something that is of the guy I like.  Yeah.  So I went to Barnes & Noble.  They didn't have much, because they're going out of business, the one by our place. 
[00:55:30]  So I went and got...  Hold on.  Let me finish my eggs, because I'm trying...  I didn't realize I was going to have to talk.  It's a coffee table book, Jerry.  Now we're going to lose our bookstores, too?  That is so weird.  I know.  It's all Kindle and stuff.  Unbelievable.  But...  I just don't like going through a bookstore.  They're like Blockbuster.  It's going to be like Blockbuster.  I know.  It's a Blockbuster situation all over again.  Everything we have is going to be delivered digitally to us.  Oh, the magic of the future.  So they didn't have...  They had a couple of books at Barnes & Noble that were nice, but nothing great.  And I wanted to get a more...  It's not like a little reader. 
[00:56:00]  I wanted to get a photo book, something that you fucking just peruse.  And, you know, easy.  And there was two Lennon books that were kind of cool, and not that expensive.  One is really nice, but I'm like, he might have that one.  So I got him.  I couldn't decide between the two, so I got him.  Yeah.  But then I'm like, you know what?  I wanted to get one really nice Beatles one.  Fuck.  So I went to Borders, and they had what I wanted.  Like a big fucking wrapped up hard edition called The Beatles Anthology.  Yeah.  And I got him that.  But then I saw this little one that was like a little The Beatles 365. 
[00:56:30]  I'm like, he might like that, too.  So I just got him that.  Aw.  And then my girlfriend, I'm like, I was going to bring two back, but I decided not to.  And I'm like, you know, I figured it'd be funny for the radio.  And she goes, no, you just know how psychotic it looks, so you have to make it funny for  the radio.  But now I'm like, I don't know if I'm going to give them to them.  I'm debating it.  Why?  No, you have to.  Because it is.  No, you have to, Jimmy.  And I don't want to freak them out and have them think I'm a kook.  I just, it was like, eh. 
[00:57:00]  Too late.  Yeah.  You have to.  All right.  I will.  Aw.  Wouldn't that be great if he got him Vladimir Lenin books and didn't even know it?  See?  Because I like John, but it's Vladimir.  Yeah.  But I was, I didn't sign them.  I didn't do that.  He probably collects rare Beatles photographs.  Yeah, he probably has Beatles stuff.  Going with what Ant was saying, he probably has.  Imagine if he's got like just Lenin, McCartney signatures.  He probably has the gun that killed Lenin at this point.  Dude, I'm sure he has a lot of Beatles stuff. 
[00:57:30]  He may have these already, but it's like.  Is that true?  What?  Danny's giving us a little info on your gift.  Don't rain on Jimmy's parade.  Oh, no.  Is it really?  It's a big day for Jimmy.  Oh, no.  The anthology book is seven years old.  Don't do this to Jimmy.  Okay, then I won't give him that one.  No, you have to.  No.  You have to.  Is it the black cover or the white cover?  It's a, it's a, it's a white cover.  Oh, then that's 10 years old.  Oh, no, no, no.  Wait, hold on. 
[00:58:00]  Oh, no, no, no.  Hold on a second.  I'll tell you.  Oh, no, this is.  You have to give this time.  You have to do this.  Jimmy, you have to.  Hold on.  I'll tell you.  It's more.  And it weighs 50 pounds.  But it's more of a gray or white cover, but it's in a fucking, it's in plastic.  Yeah, it's 10 years old.  That's not even the new one?  No, no, no.  There was one that was released in 2000, and then there's one that was released in 2003.  I wish I would have a guy.  The one that you have on your phone, that's, that's 2000.  But the black one was fucking, uh, was not wrapped. 
[00:58:30]  This one was wrapped.  It was nicer.  Oh, my God.  The black one was kind of fucking perused and stuff.  You have to let him open these up on the air.  You have to.  I see.  You have to.  Oh, here they, here they come.  Oh, no.  Here they come, kids.  Jimmy also got Ozzy a Rubik's Cube.  But no, if he has the anthology one, I could probably bring that back, because that's wrapped.  So I might be able to take that back.  No.  No.  No, no, no.  No, you have to give him the anthology. 
[00:59:00]  Look how adorable Jimmy is.  But no, he already has that one, I'm sure.  He's so cute.  He probably already has that one.  His little face is smiling and all red.  But for the show now, you gotta, he has to open it up for the radio show.  He has to.  But, uh, how old is The Beatles in 365 Days?  It's a small book.  Fuck.  You know, I was looking through the black one, too, but it was just like, the other one  was better.  Should've got that.  I can't.  Fuck.  Ten years old.  Uh, it looks like that's five years old.  Fuck.  The Ford is by Lennon. 
[00:59:30]  Yeah, oh, good.  I'm glad I got him more than one thing, but he probably has that one already.  No, we'll find out.  Shit.  You might, you might be pleasantly surprised today.  Uh, 05 is that one.  Hey, do you have a, can we, can we, I want to weigh these, because I, I didn't.  It's heavy, man.  Dude, I didn't realize.  Can you weigh the, the birthday gifts for Ozzy?  All four of them, because there's poor assistants, you don't have to carry them.  It's, it's classic.  I'm such a dummy.  That's fantastic.  Maybe I should.  I want it to be 940 so bad. 
[01:00:00]  You have to.  I can't do anything else today on this show.  Oh, it's fantastic, thank you so much.  I hope he hits you over the head with it.  Yes.  Believe, if, if life was fair, he would say, I have this, and break my fucking head open.  It's good, because mine was getting so old, and I looked through it so many times,  I needed a new one.  He probably has them.  I'm sure he has them.  But then he's going to be awkwardly polite, and then Jimmy's going to over-explain.  Yes, I can't wait to just see how this plays out.  Jimmy's going to over-explain.  I just want to see how this plays out. 
[01:00:30]  And he's going to actually tell Ozzy that he's nervous, with nervous Jimmy.  He's actually going to tell Ozzy that he could, he could bring it back.  I got a gift receipt.  Bring it to the store, back to the store, back to the bookstore, the store, somewhere there's  a store, the store, the store, the store.  Oh.  He's going to hate me.  Oh, no.  Yes, he is.  No, he's not.  No, he's going to love that you thought about it.  No, but there's a line, like, if somebody gave me, there's a line with gifts.  It's like if you're dating a chick for two weeks, and you get her a diamond ring, she 
[01:01:00]  thinks you're a fucking jizz bucket.  It's like, there's a line where something's like, oh, that's a nice, thoughtful gift,  and like, all right, you're probably going to fucking hang out in my shrubs.  You're a creep.  Well, I can't wait to see how this plays out.  I don't know.  I'm almost ready to back out.  No, no.  You can't.  At this point, you can't.  I got to see this.  Fuck, Kenny.  I should have got the black one.  Fuck.  He's going to love this.  I've never said that before.  Once you get Kenny to, Kenny can run out and get the black one before this.  No, I can't.  Because that one, I don't know if I'll be able to bring back. 
[01:01:30]  I can't tell you to do that, but you have to, at this point, allow Ozzy to open up  his gifts on the show.  Okay, but I'll tell him he has one already.  You can say whatever you want, but he's got to open them up.  But if he has one already, he's like, I got these two.  I wouldn't be offended.  Oh, my God.  I can't wait.  I can't wait.  I live for days like today.  But I've given.  This is my existence right here.  But I've given.  Uncomfortable moments.  Don't wear the bags, too, Sam.  You're fucking making me look worse.  Why?  The bags can't be more than a.  I know.  Okay.  All right.  Sorry. 
[01:02:00]  Yeah, he's weighing.  He got me back.  He's weighing the bags.  I'm going to guess at least 20 pounds.  No, I don't.  Is that heavy?  I don't know, man.  That was pretty heavy.  Yeah.  That anthology is a fucking book and a half.  How heavy is Ozzy's birthday gifts?  Maybe that's a new edition, though.  Oh, it could be.  Maybe updated.  Did they do a new edition?  No.  Fair enough.  How heavy?  Here's the official weigh-in of Ozzy's birthday gifts.  Exactly 18 pounds.  Of course.  You got Ozzy 18 pounds of gifts.  I didn't mean to buy him 18 pounds of presents. 
[01:02:30]  18 pounds of old Beatles.  That's like fucking baby Klaus's head.  They really are old.  But what are you, like, how the fuck do I know?  It's like the newer stuff.  They had newer stuff that I think was probably smaller and like, you know, real books.  But it's like I wanted to get something that I would like just to kind of peruse.  Yeah, yeah.  These weren't sit down and read books.  These are like if you're, you fucking, you know, you just look through it.  The photos are cool and you have...  It's what you call your typical coffee table book.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  But he has a lot of houses. 
[01:03:00]  So I'm like, you put one in each house.  He does.  That's true.  See?  Yeah.  He could have that already, but not have it in one of his other houses.  You're not going to make us sing happy birthday to Ozzy, are you?  Oh.  I've never seen him on his birthday, but I'm like, why not?  December 3rd.  I wish today was the actual birthday, but he's got a gig.  That's still three days away.  Well, he's doing the Izod Center in Jersey, the fucking, you know, the Meadowlands on Friday.  But I'm going to see him tomorrow at the Garden, so I have to do it now.  Ooh, some people suggesting you should go to that show and bring him a Pet Rock. 
[01:03:30]  A Pet Rock.  Oh, my God.  Oh, the listeners are going to murder me.  Believe me.  Oh, they're already killing you.  This was not going to be a good day.  Jimmy bought Ozzy 18 pounds of books for his birthday.  18 pounds.  No one wants 18 pounds of anything.  I know that.  Nobody does.  Can you imagine?  Name one thing you would want 18 pounds of.  Pussy. 
[01:04:00]  Yeah.  Blowjobs.  18 pounds of blowjobs.  18 pounds of blowjobs.  There's not 18 pounds.  He's going to fucking hate me, though.  No, no, he won't hate you.  He will love you.  He'll think I'm a psycho.  No, no.  There's not.  I'm not a psycho, though.  No, no.  Of course not.  I'm just a big fan.  But it's like, you know.  No, you're a psycho.  But no, dude, I've sat in the room with him and interviewed him, like, for real.  Yeah.  And I don't act like a creep or a.  Oh, my God.  He will.  I'm overtired today.  Did he do this for the show?  No.  He will like that.  It's the thought.  Dude, you would never carry 18 pounds of anything out of this building. 
[01:04:30]  But it's not for him.  I can't think of anything that I would carry out of here that's close to 20 pounds.  Let's be honest.  Ozzy's not going to carry that.  I'll have to apologize to Tony, his assistant, or somebody.  No, we know Ozzy's not going to carry it, but.  I hope not.  I hope when you leave.  I can mail them to him if you want.  I hope when you leave the building, they're in just a dumpster somewhere.  Dude, I did think of how funny that would be.  Oh, no.  Oh, that's terrible.  Or if I see.  There's an about Schmidt moment with Jimmy.  Oh, he just turns a corner.  Walking by the dumpster.  And sees the two bags and looks and just, oh, the books are in there. 
[01:05:00]  No, I see a fucking, I see, I see a Beatles anthology book cracked with Escalade tire tracks in it.  In the fucking curb.  This, also, Nor is suggesting that Jimmy got Ozzy 18 pounds of books, and wouldn't it be great if it made Ozzy's luggage overweight and he had to pay $175 extra?  Dude, I did think of that, too.  Like, he has to fly with 20 pounds of books?  20 pounds of books.  I can't do that, too.  This isn't, it's not going to happen.  I'm not going to do it. 
[01:05:30]  I can't, I can't make myself look ridiculous.  You have to do it.  Ozzy gets a hernia.  Hope he doesn't drop it on his foot and have to cancel the show.  Cancels the show.  Brace his foot.  Jimmy's 18 pounds of gift fell on his foot.  But then I'm thinking, because he's, he's probably doing Stern first, like Howard will have McCartney sing Happy Birthday to him.  Yeah.  And I'll have fucking, here's a, a book that's 10 years old.  Oh, oh.  I'm a zilch.  Oh, my God.  I can't wait.  It's just like that movie where someone. 
[01:06:00]  What book?  Jim's a faggot?  I didn't know that was, I didn't know that was a movie.  I didn't sleep very well last night.  I'm tuckered out today.  Oh, God.  No, but you get him the, the, the little karaoke microphone and Stern gets him the pony.  Dude, that's exactly what it is.  Then he's going to run like a retard over to the pony.  Pony!  I'm terrible.  I really am a fucking idiot.  Oh, shit.  Oh, my God.  Everyone is like, I can't wait for 940.  Oh, it's just, it's just.  It's odd.  You can't back out now. 
[01:06:30]  You just can't.  No, you have to give OzDB.  You have to give him his birthday gifts that weigh 18 pounds.  Yeah.  They really are heavy birthday gifts.  They are very heavy.  I didn't mean to do that.  I would have just bought one, but I didn't realize it was that old.  Why would they wrap the fucking old one and not the new one?  Those border cunts.  Panicking.  I don't get it.  We can't even do a show now.  Why don't you wrap the new ones?  Right.  Who wants the old, old hat wrapped up?  I guess because no one was buying them.  They probably shrink wrapped them in the back.  Everybody has them.  Oh, my fucking. 
[01:07:00]  I am utterly devoid of worth.  Oh, my God.  He's going to hate those.  He'll never do an interview with me again.  I guarantee.  No, relax.  He's going to love this.  No, he's going to think I'm an asshole.  Are you relaxed?  And he'll be right, because I think I'm one.  Breathe, brother.  Breathe.  It's going to be fine.  It's going to be fine.  It's going to be.  I can't wait for this to say.  Yeah, I know.  It's going to be awful.  And I swear to God, my girlfriend's like, get him a birthday bag.  I almost got him a birthday bag last night.  But a part of me is like, you can't get out of your birthday bag, you queer. 
[01:07:30]  What's a birthday?  What do you mean?  What's a birthday bag?  Something to carry them in.  Oh, just like a colorful little bag to put it in.  I didn't say it had to be a colorful little bag.  Maybe a pointed hat.  No.  But birthday bags are colorful, then.  They have balloons on them and candles.  Yeah, I did think of balloons, too.  Mylar balloons.  Happy birthday.  That would be funny if we had them ball.  You were thinking of birthday balloons?  No, not really.  Seriously.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  I don't know what's real anymore.  Believe me.  This is fucked up right here.  Can I say, CokeLogic, that I have a photo for Ozzy to sign today of me and him that I 
[01:08:00]  did on my last interview, which will turn out, I'm sure.  And CokeLogic photoshopped a security guy out of the back.  That motherfucker is good.  Thank you to CokeLogic.  What a great job he did.  Well, why can't someone fucking photoshopped my ex out of my Clinton picture so I can display  it in my house?  Do you have it on digital open or no?  Yeah.  You have it on digital?  Yes.  Easy job.  CokeLogic could probably do that.  Easy job.  Someone did a lame-ass job with it where Clinton's left arm looks like it's dead.  No, no, no.  Easy job.  Because they had to readjust the arm. 
[01:08:30]  I'm like, no, man.  I want this in my house, but I don't want my ex in this stupid photo.  What you'll have to do is just probably chop a long clip.  I got a picture with the president, and I can't fucking display it.  On digital, you'll have to probably put it...  Who do I send it to?  I would say CokeLogic.  Send the big file to him.  But again, you may just have to chop it.  Like my Edward Norton photo, I just chopped it to the shoulder.  It's going to look awkward.  But then you make it narrow.  You chop it on the fucking side of you so there's nothing on your outside.  Right.  And it's literally a narrow photo. 
[01:09:00]  It looks like it was taken through a door.  It's all you can do.  And then you mat frame it.  Yeah, dude, you're chopping an ex out.  Step against the edge of the frame.  It's all you can do.  Oh, look great.  My girl said just put a smiley face over her face.  That's another one.  You should have it blown up, though, dude.  It's a fucking picture with Clint.  Yeah, dude, you're crazy.  Come on, man.  Oh, my God, that would be funny.  You hand Ozzy the books, and he just doesn't even look at them.  He just signs them and hands them back to you.  Dude, that's great.  I was going to sign the inside of the book. 
[01:09:30]  Thank God I didn't.  Because my girlfriend goes, you don't sign the book.  It's not yours.  She was so annoyed at me.  And I'm like, nah, but a little thing.  She goes, no, it's a gift.  You don't make it about you forever.  I'm like, oh, you're right.  Wow, she really talks sense to you.  She really knows how fucking fuck, what a creep I am.  She's like, you sign your own books.  What, you'd be on this coffee table?  You don't inscribe it?  So I'm saying return the books, dummy.  Oh, that's good love.  Return the books, dummy, and get Ozzy a coffee mug.  Oh, I can't fucking wait. 
[01:10:00]  Look, he's panicking over there.  He's off mic.  He's just babbling to himself.  Now he's off mic talking and going through the bags.  He's just, I don't know.  He's turning into Rupert Pupkin in front of our eyes.  Now, Jerry, this is my pride and joy.  This is your birthday gift, Jerry.  It's my pride and joy, Jerry.  You keep it.  You keep it.  It'll work for you.  I can't humiliate myself.  I just can't do it.  No, no, no.  Dude, it's really warm in here.  No.  Your little cheeks are all rosy red. 
[01:10:30]  You look like Pat from Munaki.  Oh, I feel like I'm.  Jimmy, you have to go through with this.  You'll talk your way out of it.  It'll be great.  You have to now.  Even if you completely explain it to Ozzy.  I will.  I have to.  I'll have to.  He's like, what are you kidding?  You think I'm going to just.  Here's 18 pounds of gifts.  Have a great tour.  This has the potential to be one of the greatest things ever done on our show.  Here's what it's going to be.  It has that potential.  I love it.  It's going to be a monumental dud. 
[01:11:00]  It's going to be a DUD with three capital letters.  And he'll be polite.  And he'll go, oh, thank you.  Well, you know, I've got this one.  Oh, that one's.  And he'll take one of them, which is fine.  I don't want him to take.  No, you think he'll just take.  He's going to take both of them.  Both.  All four.  All four.  Four.  Oh, that's right.  There's four books.  There's one of them.  He's going to take all 18 pounds.  We have to have a hidden camera on Tony.  Because I want to see where Tony dumps the books.  I want to see where he dumps them.  Oh, poor Tony.  Tony is too nice a guy to dump the books. 
[01:11:30]  He'll dump them.  But Ozzy would probably just.  If no one's looking, everyone would dump.  As they're walking out.  No one is that nice.  He can't.  I hope they don't throw them out.  All right.  I'm going to send my picture to Coke Logic.  Thank you, Coke.  There's another.  There's another one from Jay's just saying.  I hope Ozzy opens it and goes, look, Sharon.  Here's another one.  But he probably does have a bunch of them.  Ten years old.  I didn't know that.  Why would they fucking wrap the old one?  I'd fuck borders. 
[01:12:00]  It only can be described as a tizzy that you're in.  But why would they do that?  You're in a tizzy.  He started so excited and now he's just falling apart.  I know.  In front of our eyes.  Why would they do that?  Why would they do that, Jimmy?  Yeah, why?  You wrapped a new one.  Not the old one.  What the fuck?  Everyone's read the old hat.  The new one probably.  Oh, no.  It doesn't have a George.  I was going to say a George Harrison tribute.  The old hat.  The newer one.  Yeah.  The one that's like two years newer.  It has one extra page.  All one extra page?  Yeah.  What is it? 
[01:12:30]  It's probably a big one.  Probably a photo of Ozzy and McCartney.  Ozzy might even be in the book you're giving him.  No, I looked through.  It's actually a cool book.  I didn't see through the Beatles one, the smaller one.  But the Lennon ones I looked through, they're great.  You should have got him a mixtape for his birthday.  How fucking great is that, though?  You're right.  And then talking between each one.  Oh, no.  Ozzy, I think you want to hear this song because, you know, it's like you talk about nuclear  war and stuff.  And it's like half of his songs.  Now, Ozzy, this is something I did. 
[01:13:00]  Now, picture Ozzy.  You're ready to go on stage.  The lights come on.  And you hear the music.  All right.  A lot of people want in on this.  Let's go to Rebel in Mississippi.  Rebel.  Hey, man.  What's happening?  Hey, buddy.  Love you guys.  Look, Jimmy, I love you, dude.  But how the fuck can you give the Prince of Darkness books?  Well, they're big photo books.  Not that he can't read them, but I'm sure it's like you don't give somebody, you know, fucking 
[01:13:30]  six months of reading.  Ozzy's a Beatles fan.  It's like, what else do you get?  He probably has these anyway.  But it's like, what do you get for the guy who has fucking, you know.  Know where to get him?  What?  Nothing.  Nah, I wanted to get him something, though.  Him and Sharon have been very nice to me.  We got Ozzy checking in.  Ozzy.  Oh, no.  Ozzy.  Hello?  Hello?  Yes.  I don't even feel right in it.  I don't even.  Yes, Ozzy.  Hi, guys.  It's been a long time.  How are you? 
[01:14:00]  To the point.  Oh, just Ozzy from, uh.  I have no idea.  This is Ozzy, Ozzy.  What's up?  Oh, no.  I thought I heard Jimmy fucking with me, man.  He's already got me picture books.  He's going to start a phone call if I fucking with you.  You sound like half the cast of Trainspotting.  Go away.  You don't sound like Ozzy.  He'll be here, hopefully.  I hope he doesn't cancel.  He's going to find out I got him books and fucking cancel.  No.  He's going to think it's weird.  He'll be polite, but he'll think I'm weird and not want to ever be around me. 
[01:14:30]  No.  I'm telling you, it really is.  Don't panic on us.  We need to see this.  It's like getting the hot chick too much.  No, it's going to be fine.  One book, even if he had it, would have been acceptable.  It's not.  One book would have been acceptable.  He did sound like Alfred Borden from The Prestige.  Oh, no.  He doesn't use it.  Fuck.  That guy was awful.  He sounded nothing like Ozzy.  He's our old Ozzy guy, though.  No, it's not.  He's got it.  That's not him.  You sure? 
[01:15:00]  He says it's been a long time.  Yeah, I would remember.  I remember that.  That guy was really good.  We had a guy that used to call us Ozzy that was ridiculous.  Jimmy is in all-out flip-out mode.  Oh, yeah, he is.  Jimmy's falling apart.  I didn't sleep well last night.  I was very tired.  But I'm actually...  Were you dreaming about this?  No, I just kept waking up.  I just kept waking up.  My girlfriend told me I was just too eager.  She's like, too eager?  Are you anxious?  She's like, yeah, you're just too excited.  This is a great idea.  Jimmy in Arkansas.  Jimmy.  No, I wish that's where I was. 
[01:15:30]  Jimmy.  Yes.  Jimmy, this is a colossal disaster waiting to happen.  Why don't you just go get him a Vermont teddy bear, you fucking idiot?  Vermont teddy bear.  Dude, Beetle...  Let me tell you something.  Yes.  A Beetle book...  And I understand that four is excessive.  But Beetle books are not...  18 pounds.  They're not mushy gifts.  They're not like, you've meant so much to me gifts.  Those are like, I hope this is something you might like.  And again, having gotten enough things from people...  If somebody got me fucking books on Kiss, or Sabbath, or Ozzy, or something like a flip 
[01:16:00]  through book, or on Pryor, that I would like.  I would actually look at that in the hotel, or I would actually look at that...  Whatever.  Those are ones I would like.  I've gotten some cool audio stuff from Ozzy.  That type of shit I actually like.  It's not something that makes it about me.  It's not something that I connect myself to Ozzy with.  If he's a huge Beatles fan, he probably has real Beatles memorabilia.  But this...  You're right.  Like, I could never get him anything that he already has.  Like, that's better than what he has.  But who knows? 
[01:16:30]  I don't know what he...  He may have these already.  He may have these.  I refrained, and I almost did, but I didn't.  I don't know if Sharon's with him, because she's doing television.  But I was going to text her photos of the books and say, does he have these?  But I couldn't bring myself to do it.  Oh, yeah.  I didn't do it.  Just let Jimmy keep talking.  Oh, I know.  It really is great.  It really is.  I'm coming apart.  I'm just tired.  I'm coming apart.  And he wants to bail so bad, but Jimmy's all about making the show better. 
[01:17:00]  So you're in a quandary right now.  Yes.  You're really in a quandary.  It's like...  You know you've got to do it for the show.  I think he kind of knows me now.  It's like, you know, again, he meets...  I've interviewed people with people I don't even remember.  Like, I've been on people's radio shows.  Yeah.  Like, BJ Shea, I know, and all the main guys.  But I'll meet someone whose show I didn't say fucking, you know, Cincinnati, where I  go, oh my god, yeah.  Like, it doesn't even register it.  I'm a nobody on that level.  So I don't expect the guy to just go, oh, yeah, I know you.  But I've interviewed him enough where I think he kind of knows me.  So it's like, I don't want to just be douchebag guy. 
[01:17:30]  Right.  You don't want to...  No, no.  I've had people who are obsessed with me, and it's like, ugh, it gives me the creeps.  I don't want to give the guy the creeps.  No, you don't.  But I do.  But 18 pounds of gifts.  18 pounds of gifts and a photo of us that's big.  Oh my god.  Yeah, look at the size of that.  It's a big photo of us.  Why is your photo so big?  It's as big as a chair.  It's in a reclining chair.  It's as big as the chair.  Why is your photo so big?  Dude, I was going to get it bigger.  Can I see how big the photo is? 
[01:18:00]  What is it?  Just a picture?  Yeah.  Why does it have to be so big?  It's such a nice picture.  Dude, it's such a nice picture.  What goes on in your head?  I don't know.  But I'm like, maybe...  Maybe fucking...  I'm like, maybe I should get bigger.  My girlfriend's like, what's wrong with you?  She really does talk sense to me sometimes.  You were going to get it bigger than that?  Oh, yeah.  Like Anthony said, it's as big as the chair.  That's not that big.  It's as big as the back of a reclining chair. 
[01:18:30]  Look at how it's all wrapped.  Well, I went to Dugald.  Honestly, and I'm not stumping for it, the best fucking photo place in the country.  As far as I'm concerned.  They know what they're doing with photos.  It's mind-boggling how good they are.  I like that.  They put it in between the cardboard.  Very nice.  Have you seen this yet?  I have seen the photo yet.  Please, I opened it when I got there.  Oh, no.  How bad would I be?  I was hoping for a big fingerprint right in the middle of Martin's face.  Oh.  Alright, he's carefully opening up the photo so he can see the photo.  Dude, they put cardboard around it.  They put a little thing on the fucking front. 
[01:19:00]  They don't play games.  They're not games players.  This is your thing, though.  This is Jimmy's thing, man.  Well, also, I've got to say, too.  Jimmy loves the Oz.  I'm doing something for Fuse tomorrow.  They're doing something on Ozzy fans, I guess, for one of his concerts or whatever.  And Amy's actually doing it.  And she called me and goes, can we shoot in your house?  I would love to do you.  And, like, could I come?  And so it's like, I also kind of...  I wish they would shoot in your house, too.  That's huge.  That's cool.  Yeah.  Alright, here comes the big...  So, wow.  It's a good shot, right?  Holy shit. 
[01:19:30]  Let me see the photo.  That is...  That is the biggest...  That's a poster.  I know.  Okay, cool.  That trends...  That goes past picture, photo...  It becomes a poster at some point, Jimmy.  But it's really not...  I'll tell you how big it is.  It's 13 by 20.  Or by 21.  That's huge.  Is that big?  Okay, good.  I'm happy I didn't get any bigger.  That's someone's window out there.  That is fantastic.  It's a great picture.  Yeah, and you can't even tell there was a guy in the back photoshopped out. 
[01:20:00]  Out!  Wait, where's the guy?  Exactly.  Dead where he should be.  Where is he?  Out of my Aussie picture.  Wait, and it was cropped out?  No, photoshopped.  Let me see.  Please.  I'll show you where he was, dude.  He was...  Because this could get me excited about my Clinton picture.  The guy...  Just look at it.  So where the fuck was the guy?  Okay, hold on.  Holy shit.  Let's see.  Hold on.  Oh, you have the original.  Of course, I have it on the computer just in case it was an issue.  Wait, where did the guy go? 
[01:20:30]  Fucking Coke Logic is great.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Like this Seinfeld episode, though, where they photoshop Ozzy out and leave you and the  janitor.  Did they do that in Seinfeld?  Yeah.  Him and some other guy.  And then he draws the picture.  Why did they photoshop him out?  Because it's Seinfeld.  Yeah.  It was a very involved plot.  Hold on.  Ozzy looks good in that picture.  It's a great... 
[01:21:00]  It was a great...  It is a great picture.  Yeah.  It's very colorful.  It's a bit on the big side.  It's huge.  It's a good picture.  I also knew I was doing...  Again, I kind of...  I will...  In the spirit of honesty, I knew I was doing Fuse tomorrow.  Yeah.  And...  Then you could have this in the Fuse thing.  Yeah.  But I have another one.  But it's your thing, man.  I have another one from that moment where he's choking me.  But this one's actually better.  But I said to my girlfriend, I should have gotten them both the same size.  Ah.  And then had like a series.  And she goes like, you're just a fucking idiot. 
[01:21:30]  He wants a series of photographs.  It's a series.  Let's see the original.  Get the fuck out of here.  Oh, look at that assholes against the wall over there.  How the fuck did he do that?  Oh, yeah.  He got him right out of there.  Coke Logic did a fucking amazing job.  It was over your shoulder.  Yeah.  You used that...  What do you call the clone tool, I think.  Clone tool.  Whatever he used.  Yeah.  He took that out of there.  Whatever he used.  That's very good.  Good job.  Seal that thing up.  Don't get it...  Don't fuck it up.  Yeah.  Put it all back together.  I know.  But he's going to think I'm a dick.  Well.  No.  Not really.  No.  Everything's going to be fine, Jimmy. 
[01:22:00]  It's not.  It's going to be fine.  Stop panicking.  We'll take a break so Jimmy can calm down.  No, you're not panicking.  A little bit.  No.  No, you're fine.  Okay.  Is it still warm in here?  Oh, no.  The thing is stuck to the tape.  Oh, no, it isn't.  Yes, it is.  Where?  The goddamn thing is stuck to the tape.  The paper?  Fucking tape.  The paper is stuck to the tape.  Sucker.  Right, yeah.  There you go.  You all right?  Oh, boy.  I stopped breathing for a second.  Holy shit.  Did you stop breathing?  Oh, my God.  All I pictured was the tape on the picture and then him pulling it off and a piece of 
[01:22:30]  the picture just peeling off of the tape.  Holy shit.  That would have just been fucking crazy.  Jimmy, how bad would that be?  Fucking crazy.  Would that be just the worst thing to make it ever happen?  It would annoy me a lot, but it wouldn't.  Literally, the only thing that would.  My signed Sabbath picture would ruin me.  Yes, yes.  But again, I got that.  It's like, I got to get that framed, too.  It's not framed yet.  But this is just a photo I could always get signed again.  Is that the picture?  Not that one, but the signed Sabbath one.  That's the one that went cross-country and back. 
[01:23:00]  Yep.  That's the other one.  Yeah.  I traveled on fucking planes with that thing.  I told you the fucking scumbag flight attendant was trying to bend the thing, taking it out.  I'm like, stop bending it.  I screamed at a flight attendant.  Stop, you're bending it.  All right, you're putting it all back together.  Yeah.  Okay.  All right, we're going to take a break.  Let Jimmy calm down.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, fuck, dude.  I know Sam hasn't.  What happened?  Nothing.  I'm just, I'm just, I realize I'm coming on.  No, you're great.  Tickets go on sale Friday morning. 
[01:23:30]  If I make it through this for the second showdown, which is Saturday, the 15th, we change the  night.  One guy Twittered, he goes, well, dude, what are we going to get like sloppy seconds the  next night?  It's like, dude, we're not, what are you, why?  We can't do, you think we can do comedy two nights in a row?  The first show sold out is Friday?  No, it's Sunday.  Because it's a holiday weekend.  So the second show is now Saturday.  The night before.  Saturday, the 15th, goes on sale Friday morning.  Okay, no, both shows are going to be good.  Why do the fans always have to be fucking assholes all the time?  They can't help it. 
[01:24:00]  They can't help it?  Meaning.  How about they help it a little bit?  Just a little bit.  He got scared.  He was scared.  He wanted to make sure he was getting a good show.  Both shows are going to be amazing.  That's an amazing lineup.  The first show sold out in like a day, and the second show is going to sell out even quicker.  I hope so.  I hope, because we didn't really do any advertising on the first one.  I know, that's what I'm saying.  All right, tickets go on sale Friday morning, 10 a.m., yeah.  All right, very, very good.  The O.P. and Anthony Show on the virus.  Series XM. 
[01:24:30]  31 years ago today, huh?  Pink Floyd's the wall.  Jimmy ran off.  He's panicking.  Anthony's out of the studio.  They'll be back in a few minutes.  Got Sam in studio. 
[01:25:00]  Ozzy Osbourne stopping by at 940.  Jimmy's got his 18 pounds of birthday gifts.  In honor of that, I think we started a little Twitter game today.  Someone suggested it.  So, 18 pounds of what is what we're playing on Twitter today?  Go to Opie Radio for all the details.  Holy shit.  All right, hey, we got a retard issuing a severe earthquake warning.  Some people have heard this guy before, but I don't think we've ever played it on our show.  You want to play that real fast? 
[01:25:30]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  He warns the world of big-time earthquakes.  Does he?  How does he know?  He just knows.  He's very accurate with his predictions, too.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's listen to him.  And I believe this one came in very recently, within the last month.  This is Frankie McDowell, my own TV station, live in the network park.  Attention citizens of California.  Attention citizens of Oregon.  Attention citizens of Washington. 
[01:26:00]  Attention citizens of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.  Earthquake warning has been issued for California.  It's going to be 9.0 or greater magnitude.  People in California, you have to be prepared for a major earthquake.  It's going to record in September 2010.  The earthquake will be so powerful in California.  It may destroy lots of houses. 
[01:26:30]  It may destroy telephone poles.  It may destroy all kinds of transformers.  It may knock all kinds of telephone poles over in California.  People in California, be prepared.  Have your medical kits ready.  Have your everything ready.  Have your everything ready.  And have all the flash strikes ready and cat folks and everything.  Earthquake will be so powerful in California. 
[01:27:00]  It may destroy everything.  It's going to be 9.0 greater magnitude.  Golden Gate Bridge may collapse.  It may affect Arizona, Nevada, Utah, Colorado.  It may affect Montana, Idaho, and everything.  People in California, be prepared for a September 2010 major earthquake.  Have a nice day.  Have a nice day. 
[01:27:30]  People in California, be prepared for a major earthquake.  Good luck.  You can't have a nice day.  September 2110?  Harbinger of doom.  Yeah.  Well, the big one's coming.  September of 2010.  We passed it.  He didn't say that was going to happen that day.  Did he?  No.  He just said, be prepared.  He said it in September of 2010.  Yeah.  Oh, he did.  Yeah.  It may.  We're actually surprised the retarded guy got the fucking earthquake prediction wrong.  Yeah.  We're disappointed.  I hate that guy. 
[01:28:00]  Why do you hate him?  Because he's retarded.  And he sounds it.  It may.  Golden Gate Bridge may collapse.  I don't even know what to say about that.  He's dumb.  Yeah.  Did he get a lot of views?  He does okay.  I don't know.  He does okay.  When I saw that video, I thought I saw that guy before, but I hadn't heard it.  So I said, maybe it's just me.  But I hope that he saw it before.  He's been around a little bit.  He comes out with a prediction every once in a while. 
[01:28:30]  Only earthquakes?  He loves the earthquakes.  Oh, okay.  I thought maybe he predicted other shit.  I don't think so.  He just loves predicting earthquakes.  One of our favorites, Regis Philbin.  Yes, Regis.  We love the Regis, and we love the Perkswitch.  I love him.  It is Regis and Kelly commercials for the T.  What is it?  T.D. Bank.  T.D. Bank.  With the horrible acting from Kelly.  Hello?  Kelly?  Why would Regis agree to...  I know he is a doddering fool, but why would he agree to just portray himself as a doddering 
[01:29:00]  fool in those things?  How do I set my alarm clock?  And she's just like in bed, like, what are you doing, Regis?  What are you...  Why are you calling me?  I don't know.  I want to go to the bank, but I shit my pants.  Oh, well, clean up, and we'll go to the bank tomorrow.  Where are you now, Regis?  I don't know.  I'm looking around.  I'm lost.  Yeah, he's, uh...  He sounds like a real idiot in those. 
[01:29:30]  That's horrible.  And her acting is...  It's just ridiculously bad.  What's this about, Sam?  What are you?  Sam, you got big news or something?  Yeah.  What's going on?  What's going on?  Wasn't there a big announcement or some shit?  Hope it rhymes with moicide.  All right, we got Sam's big announcement coming up, but first, the Regis thing.  What happened with Regis and this broad Nicki Minaj?  Nicki Minaj.  Who's Nicki Minaj?  Well...  See, I know, but these guys don't.  I know.  Yeah.  She's one of the hottest... 
[01:30:00]  She's from Ant's favorite, Lil Wayne's camp.  Oh, yeah?  Young Money.  She's one of the...  I think it's a huge...  Let me say that.  Have we done the Lil Wayne thing on the air yet?  N-I-C-K-I.  Yeah, we...  I don't think we did it on the air yet.  You're obsessed with Lil Wayne out of nowhere.  Well, not...  We could kill two birds with one stone here.  You're obsessed with Lil Wayne, and then we do the Regis Perf switch thing.  Not obsessed, but we did talk about it on the air.  I don't think we did.  Yeah, we did.  Nicki Minaj.  Yeah, we did.  Where was I?  We actually hit that on the air.  Fucking bottoms.  Where was I? 
[01:30:30]  Holy...  I don't know.  You were here.  It was quick, though.  Yeah, it was quick.  We kind of just talked about the movie, because I said I saw the movie, the car  I saw the movie.  Yeah, it was quick, though.  That's right.  Okay, that's why.  Yeah, we just kind of talked about them.  What does she do?  Okay.  She's a rapper.  Wow.  She's pretty hot.  Dude, look at the bulge in her fucking bikini bottom.  Man face.  Except, uh...  Would you?  No.  Since she put out her album, she's cleaned up her image a little bit.  Do we have any more pictures of her crotch like that?  I'm not attractive.  Who wants to be that lollipop?  She hasn't...  I mean, she's with Lil Wayne and Drake in them, but she's not with him. 
[01:31:00]  She looks like a drag queen.  All right, she's a little rough.  She looks like a drag queen.  Look at how fat that pussy is.  I'm out, though.  First picture I was in, second picture I'm out.  She's a fat pussy.  I'd rather take a skinny pussy, punch it, so it swells up, and then...  Jesus.  Yeah, then you have punched pussy syndrome.  Oh, sure do, Chip.  When Ozzy comes, they'll crack him up.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Yeah, that's when you'll never hear Chip.  Yeah, exactly.  When Ozzy's here.  Yeah, what are you doing?  The garden outside with the tomato plants and something? 
[01:31:30]  Ah, because it's as bad as a square garden.  I know.  It's different.  Oh.  Chip gets mad when you're questioning.  Wow.  What happened?  What happened?  Chip got upset.  Look at this.  See?  Jesus Christ, that chick is ugly.  You're absolutely right.  Nicki Minaj?  Yes.  She's got a nice body.  Dude, that fucking vag is sexy, man.  But her face is a little rough.  She's got a very fat ass, too.  Good.  Although there's been rumors of silicone and under-the-clothes butt padding. 
[01:32:00]  Oh, like they come off when the pants come off?  That's right.  There have been rumors.  Ugh.  Just rumors, though.  Just rumors.  That's some rumors.  Man, I am really, really fucking-  Racist.  Just race fucking-  Why would you pause there?  That's true.  That's no sense.  No, I am really, like, race-specific as far as the type of girl I like looking at.  White?  White?  Yeah.  Without a fat ass. 
[01:32:30]  That's unfortunate.  That's just fucking-  There you go.  He just-  Danny just put skinny pale girl in the search, and there it is.  And the internet just said, not found.  It's just like, there it is.  There it is.  There's a bunch of skinny pale girl pictures.  That's you?  I would take her over fucking-  Nicki Minaj?  Yeah.  Nicki Minaj is a-  Why is the internet suck so bad today?  Oh, because it's-  Oh, because a lot of people are shopping. 
[01:33:00]  Yeah, it's the day after Cyber Monday.  Are you kidding or no?  By the way, Cyber Monday, 20% more than last year.  Not doing very well online.  Ugh, look at that.  Stop it.  That looks like a fucking-  I can't even tell-  Wait a minute.  That's-  That's some type of monster.  You know what?  No, that's not a monster.  If it wasn't for the smell, I would be able to deal with that.  Oof.  No.  Yes.  Yeah, that's a little too chubby.  I would be able to deal with that.  That's-  I would definitely- 
[01:33:30]  Is that Nicki Minaj?  No.  Who's that?  I would fool around with that.  The model.  No, they all look alike.  That's what I've been Googled when I put in skinny pal girl.  Oh, really?  She's not a skinny pal girl.  No, she's not.  No, she's-  That's probably the tippity top of my acceptance.  Really?  Yeah, me too.  Like, that's just about it.  That would wreck you, man.  Anything more than that, it's just much.  That would just wreck any-  It's a black chick.  She's kind of spreading her legs.  It's from the rear, bottom-like angle, looking up at her ass. 
[01:34:00]  And it's, uh, her ass is, it just looks like pure muscle.  And it's big.  That would be a handjob.  It kind of looks like-  In her ass crack.  Two fly eyes.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  They're like compound eyes.  That would be a nut crusher, man.  Yeah, yeah.  If she was on top.  We did it.  Absolutely.  All right.  Where are we at?  Regis and Nicki Minaj?  Yeah, I think Regis has a thing for Nicki Minaj.  Yeah.  Because she's done a show twice in like a month.  And this time, uh- 
[01:34:30]  Good God.  Let me see.  See, that's a pale-  Wow, what a fuck-  Look at her pussy.  It's almost like her pussy is, uh, is ready to say something.  Because the one lip is a little lower.  Yeah.  She has-  Yeah.  It's a Stallone pussy.  She's nice, though.  Come on, fuck me.  Old Edmund Musky face pussy.  She's got some, uh, set on her there.  She's got a nice set of boobies.  Nice tits.  Nice fucking melons.  Wow, there you go. 
[01:35:00]  Uh, so, uh, Regis' perv switch went off?  Yeah, because they were-  Three of them were on a stage.  They were doing a Vegas live, you know, show.  What the hell are they doing on stage with-  When Nicki Minaj was performing.  See, like I said, she's cleaned up her act.  She's trying to go very mainstream.  Yeah, so what was she doing with Regis, though?  That's pretty fucking hardcore mainstream.  She's trying to get the number one album in the country.  It just came out this week.  It's probably going to be number one.  But, um-  What's her song off this album?  Um, well, she has gotten a lot of press for her verse on the song Monster. 
[01:35:30]  Kanye West, Jay-Z, Nicki Minaj.  Is she good?  Is Kanye-  She's very good.  On certain songs.  Is Kanye a part of every song that comes out these days?  He put this one out.  Oh.  It's his song.  Can we hear a little of that?  Monster?  The song is the shit.  Language.  Sorry.  My ears are not garbage cans.  Remember that from Dog Day Afternoon?  He said, fuck. 
[01:36:00]  Yeah, he said.  Mr. Mulhaney said he was sorry about his use of language.  I think they're trying to find the verse.  She was so fucking pissed.  My ears.  My ears are not garbage cans.  And they all laughed at her.  We're being robbed, you cunt.  Yeah, dummy.  Shut up.  Yeah, we don't have the song.  It's not that hot.  No, no, no.  We have it.  It's really not a hot song.  It's huge.  Oh, no, no.  You're right.  Opie is right.  That's kind of convincing.  It's not a hot song.  I told you.  Are they playing it on Hits 1?  It's a little too urban for Hits 1. 
[01:36:30]  Hits 1 doesn't go terribly urban.  Nicki Minaj doesn't make a lot of appearances on Hits 1.  As a matter of fact, most pop songs with a rap verse in them, the rap verse gets removed.  From Hits 1?  Yeah, yeah.  Wow.  Why?  They're not very urban on Hits 1.  I don't like it.  Why would you take the fucking song?  You can't take the song apart, man.  Well, we don't do it.  They make...  I don't like when they do that type of thing.  I think the labels make specific versions for Hits Radio, and they send a version without...  As long as we're not doing it here at SiriusXFam.  No, no, no.  We don't do it.  The labels send... 
[01:37:00]  Do they ship the verse off somewhere?  I don't think so.  That's kind of an idea.  Sure.  Maybe they ship it off to Booville.  It's true.  I already have these!  Oh, no.  Oh, boy.  You're not over yet.  No, Jimmy.  It's okay.  You're just tuning in.  15 pounds of gift.  If you're just tuning in, wait for the Ozzy interview coming up in about an hour and  a half.  Yeah.  With Jimmy's birthday gifts for Ozzy.  Jimmy's going to be giving Ozzy some birthday gifts.  Why don't we just play Regis losing his mind? 
[01:37:30]  So, basically, Nikki was talking to Kelly and had her back to Regis, and the entire time,  Regis was staring at her ass.  Really?  And then Regis started talking to her about her outfit and, you know, describing the outfit,  and all of a sudden, slaps her on the ass.  No way.  And then Kelly goes, what are you doing?  And instead of, like, making a joke about it, that's how you know it's for real, he  immediately changed the subject to Lil Wayne.  He lost his mind.  Because he didn't want to comment on the fact that all he wants to do is fucking Minaj. 
[01:38:00]  He forgot where he was.  He forgot where he was.  Let me see.  He likes blood.  I gotta smack that ass!  He just looked at that fat ass.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, we gotta see the video.  It's on Huffington Post.  Here's the audio as we find the video.  Wishy man?  It really is.  The hair is great.  Yeah, thank you.  I want my hair back by the end of the show, by the way.  Oh, I'm sorry.  And I love the way you dress, too.  You like it?  I'm not so glad you're wearing pink, because I'm on Pink Friday.  Yes.  I think you're so cute.  I love it.  Thank you very much.  This looks like you've got a little strap around you there, you know what I mean? 
[01:38:30]  Regis!  What just happened?  And I want to tell you something.  Little Wayne, your friend?  Yes.  Little Wayne, I love him.  I love Little Wayne, too.  How's the right way would it be if Little Wayne shot Regis?  Oh, right.  Fantastic.  All right, we gotta see the video of this.  You gotta go forward.  Oh, they're on a stage. 
[01:39:00]  Hey, gorgeous.  Hi, I don't even know.  Nicki Minaj has had a terrific story behind it.  You know, grew up in Queens, went to LaGuardia High School, which is...  LaGuardia High School.  He's just trying to conduct a professional interview, and all of a sudden, he just keeps  looking at that ass.  He really is.  Sort of part of your passion.  Look at that ass.  Mm-hmm.  Look at him.  Look at him.  His head just started tilting down for the first time.  Watch his head while she's talking to Kelly.  Big, bulbous, and black.  Love it. 
[01:39:30]  And you know the hair.  It's all about putting on a show.  It really is a hairspray.  Look at him.  Oh, my God.  He's a courageous.  Holy shit.  And I love the way you dress, too.  What?  I'm not happy that you're wearing pink, because I'm on a Pink Friday.  I hear you.  I think you're so cute.  I love it.  Thank you very much.  This looks like you've got a little strap around you there.  Boom.  Regis.  Oh, Jesus.  He had a feeling.  He just wanted to touch it so bad.  He had to touch it.  I love it.  I gotta touch it.  And I want to tell you something. 
[01:40:00]  Little Wayne, your friend.  Just move on to the next thing.  Move on.  Your friend.  Wow.  Little Wayne.  But I mean, you know.  You can't blame Regis.  Well, how come you d***s got huge asses?  I don't understand it.  It's beautiful.  I have to touch it.  Big and black.  Oh, you d***s are great.  You think he probably likes big black asses?  He probably does.  He wants it.  He was staring at me. 
[01:40:30]  He wants it.  He's actually bent down to touch her ass.  He's on morning national network television on the Reyes and Kelly show.  Yeah.  Just the most family-friendly woman show.  And Regis is just forgetting the entire thing and just staring directly at her ass.  At her ass.  And smacking it.  Well, we're losing Larry King.  We need a new guy that might be losing it.  That is just losing his mind?  Yeah, on TV.  It could be Regis.  Here's a little more.  Yeah, then he decided to take an opportunity to make an erection joke.  What? 
[01:41:00]  That's how I took it, anyway.  So, what advice did little Wayne give you?  Wayne tells me to go hard.  Go hard.  Go hard.  Wish I could, but, you know...  Stop it!  That's a boner joke.  You've got to give it to him.  That is a good one.  He wishes he could fuck hard.  That's a good joke.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He probably heard Nicki Minaj's verse on Monster and was just like...  Awesome.  We heard some of that?  Someone's saying, play the verse, it's amazing.  It is.  It's fucking amazing.  Why is it amazing? 
[01:41:30]  Because she's on a song with Jay-Z and Kanye West, and everybody's saying that she is the  one who kills the song.  Jay-Z and Kanye West are now legendary rappers.  That's right.  Oh, shit, yo.  Not in a violent way.  Let's hear her killing the song.  I don't hear anything.  I don't hear anything.  I don't hear anything.  I'ma need to see your fucking hand.  Pull up in a monster automobile gangsta.  With a bad bitch that came from Sri Lanka.  Yeah, I'm in a tanga color of Willy Wonka.  You could be the king, but watch the queen conquer.  Okay, first things first, I'll eat your brain. 
[01:42:00]  Then I'ma start rocking gold teeth and fangs.  Cause that's what a motherfucking monster do.  He a dresser from Milan, that's the monster doe.  Monster just a B heel, that's the monster show.  Young money is the roster and a monster crow.  And I'm all up, all up, all up in the bank with a funny face.  And if I'm fake, I ain't know this cause my money ain't.  Let me get this straight.  Wait, I'm a rookie, but my features in my show is ten times your pay.  The DK for a verse, no album out.  Yeah, my money's so tall that my barbies gotta climb it.  Hotter than the Middle East and climb it, find it. 
[01:42:30]  Tony, my tyrant, dotty, whine it, whine it.  Nicki on them pitties when I sign it.  How these niggas sell one track, mind it.  But Billy Billy, I don't give a F-U-C-K.  Forget Bobby, fuck Nicki, shit, she's fake.  She on a diet, but her pockets ain't in cheesecake.  And I'll say, boy, the Chucky is chalk's play.  Just killed another career, it's a mile day.  Besides Ye, they can't stand besides me.  I think me, you and Ian, Jim and Nage Friday.  The pink wig, dick ass, give him whiplash. 
[01:43:00]  I think big, get cash, make him blink fast.  Now look at what you just saw, this is what you live for.  I'm a motherfucking monster.  She's ripping off Pee Wee Herman.  What do you mean?  Let me tell you something, though.  I'm a motherfucking monster.  What is she doing?  I like it.  It's not bad, I mean.  I don't know that shit, but I like it.  So it's different.  But it reminds me of old school, the way she's like, I eat brains.  That sounds like something Roxanne Shantae would have done in like 1986. 
[01:43:30]  It's like Busta.  She fucking sounded like Busta.  What it is right now.  But it wasn't bad.  I like it more than I thought I would.  I wouldn't mind smelling her butthole.  That'd be good, too.  Smelling her butthole.  Yeah, give it a little kiss and a nuzzle.  Well, not a Regis.  We should play Control the Boner.  Ah, yes.  Regis couldn't do it.  He couldn't control the boner.  He couldn't control it.  This is for you, Regis.  We'll be an Anthony show on the virus.  Sirius XM.  I don't want to take what you can't do. 
[01:44:00]  I'll have to starve and eat your bread.  I'll ever run, but I can't walk.  Guess I'll lie alone just like before.  Where are you at with Pearl Jam these days, Ant?  Ah, same as it ever was.  I'm just, you know, I like their hits, and you go any deeper than that, and you lose me with them.  Pearl Jam Radio?  Nah, I haven't given that a shot yet. 
[01:44:30]  You should check it out.  It's pretty good.  I haven't given it a shot.  I think Eddie Vedder is doing a solo tour of Australia.  But I don't understand.  I just, the first thing that came to my mind, I should have just blurted it out, was, who gives a shit?  Me too.  I was like, oh, God, Travis, of course you're the woman.  Yeah, but the only reason I bring it up is, when you've got a voice so distinctive as Eddie Vedder,  what's the difference if he tours with his band or does it?  Or not, because it's just like Pearl Jam, I guess, right? 
[01:45:00]  And I know Pearl Jam fans would argue the music and this and that.  Sure.  Yeah, man.  But Eddie Vedder's voice is so distinctive.  Yeah, I'm just not into the Pearl Jam.  Unless he goes on tour and doesn't play any Pearl Jam songs.  Yeah, I mean, he plays a couple, but he's got solo material, so.  Oh, that's what everyone wants to hear.  What's his biggest solo song?  I don't even know.  Is it something from that movie?  Yeah, it was from Into the Wild.  Into the Wild soundtrack with Eddie Vedder was pretty fucking good.  Really?  That's pretty much what he plays. 
[01:45:30]  No, I'm not going to.  I'm just not.  No?  No, I'm not.  No?  Nope.  Put up my, um, had the Mexicans come by last night, put up all my Christmas decorations  in my Jewish neighborhood.  That must have made them feel good, huh?  I like how the story started.  He's like, I, uh, I put, I had the Mexicans over yesterday.  Yeah, it's like I was going to say I put my Christmas decorations up, but it's like,  nah, I didn't do that.  You should just make the Mexicans hold your Christmas decorations for a month in place. 
[01:46:00]  Oh, oh, just hold it there?  I thought you were going to say, like, they store it.  What?  They store it, and then they come back every year and put it up.  Oh, really?  They came by last night at like 7.30, and it's, you know, it's pitch black out, because  it's winter.  It gets dark at what, 2.40 in the afternoon?  It's crazy.  Oh, fuck.  It's crazy.  It's crazy.  It's the dumbest thing ever we've talked about, so I'll shut up.  And they come by, and they put, like, Klieg lights onto the front of the house.  What is that?  Lights that shine up?  That's those big, like, big, bright fucking spotlights on the house to work on it. 
[01:46:30]  And they have this cherry picker thing that they pull into the driveway and just, like,  like you would use to trim trees and work on telephone poles, and these Mexicans are all  up in the air, and they're putting all the stuff up.  They decorate the entire house outside of the house in, like, two hours.  Are you an obnoxious guy with your decorations?  No, no, no.  It's not obnoxious at all.  I'm not a fan of obnoxious guy.  No, no.  I don't go with the mechanical thing.  Every neighborhood has one of those assholes. 
[01:47:00]  No, no.  It's lights.  It's, you know, it's tastefully done.  Tastefully.  On all of the, you know, accents of the house and some of the trees in the front and the  walkway and things like that.  Are you obsessed with electricity?  I love electricity.  You love using a lot of it.  I love using it, and just, I keep using it.  It's fascinating to me.  But again...  Is there a picture of this?  What it looks like?  I don't want to put a picture of my house on anywhere. 
[01:47:30]  People find it, you know, they always do anyway.  They fucking know anyway.  What are they going to do?  Come on, bring it.  Bring it, motherfucker.  That's what I say.  No, it's...  But when it gets dark out in the neighborhood, it's the only house that has lights.  The Jews, the rest of the Jews in the neighborhood...  Too busy suffering.  They have a little menorah.  Right.  It's a little menorah, and the little things that represent suffering.  Like, Christmas is all about joy and fun and a lot of Catholic holidays. 
[01:48:00]  Have joy in them.  Or joyous and everything.  The Jewish people just love the suffering.  Why don't they give up at this point and just make their holiday in February?  Yeah, yeah.  The worst month of the year.  Don't try to compete.  You're just hurting your children, first of all.  You just hurt your children, because the little Hanukkah kids, I remember when I was in school,  the little Hanukkah kids, as we called them, would come into school after Hanukkah and Christmas  was over, and kids would be with their Christmas toys and presents and go, look what I got. 
[01:48:30]  And the little Hanukkah kid is like, ah, I got fucked again.  And you notice they always dressed in very dark colors?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Very depressing.  Yeah, just to keep the suffering going for everybody.  Yeah, a little suffering.  Why do they have to suffer so much?  I don't know.  Don't have bitter herbs.  Have herbs that taste good.  Leaven that bread up.  Put some yeast in the stuff.  It'll rise up and get all doughy and nice.  It just reminded me, I was following a jih the other day.  Yeah. 
[01:49:00]  Down to my building, and it was very windy.  And the whole conversation he was having with his young jih daughter was that he was  wearing the wrong yarmulke because it was so windy out.  Oh, so you got to watch that.  But that's all he would talk about.  He was obsessing that he was wearing the wrong...  Are there different yarmulkes that you wear in the different weather?  Yeah, maybe there's a nail in it so it doesn't blow off.  Chin strap.  Maybe they have a lead yarmulke so it doesn't move when it's windy out.  I don't know.  I live amongst the Jews, but I know not much about them. 
[01:49:30]  That's a mystery.  That's because I don't say anything to my neighbors.  Can I go off-roading for a second?  Oh, where are we going?  Because we yell and scream at the NFL all the time.  Yeah.  The NFL fined those two guys for that big, amazing fight with the helmet coming off and  all.  Should have paid them.  It was entertaining.  One of the best football fights in recent memory.  They only fined the guys and they're not suspending them.  $25,000 each.  Yes.  Yeah.  I think that is awesome that the NFL didn't go for the suspension.  Thank you.  Well, yeah.  But then they won't accept Ashley Madison's advertisement. 
[01:50:00]  No, I understand that.  I mean, they've got a long ways to go, but they've been, you know, not doing the right  thing for a long time.  And LeBron is not a bust, but his team's a bust in Miami so far.  They're barely above .500.  Do you think people in Cleveland would be happy if LeBron lost that game?  Dude, LeBron's going back to Cleveland for the first time.  When is that?  I think that's this week or maybe.  I think it's Christmas, right?  Oh, it's Christmas?  Isn't that a big Christmas game?  Okay.  And seats are going for $5,000 a piece. 
[01:50:30]  In that shit fucking town?  No offense, Cleveland.  I love you.  But why don't you stop?  The guy who threw the ball in the hole is now throwing the ball in the hole in another  place.  Who fucking cares?  I got to tell you.  I've got enough with this already.  You know that big LeBron James commercial where he's saying, what should I have done?  Blah, blah, blah.  Yeah.  Very self-serving.  Someone redid the commercial with Jordan.  Have you seen this yet?  No.  It's probably more for basketball people, but a lot of people know the LeBron James story. 
[01:51:00]  Is that what they're called now?  Huh?  Basketball people.  I didn't know what terminology we're using.  Well, LeBron James acknowledged what he did and did a big, huge, over-the-top Nike commercial  about it.  Yeah.  Should I have stayed?  Should I have done this?  Did I wreck my legacy?  Blah, blah, blah.  And someone cut in Michael Jordan.  And just trashes LeBron.  Oh, really?  I think the audio would work.  What should I do?  Should I admit that I've made mistakes?  Should I remind you that I've done this before? 
[01:51:30]  Want to see my shiny new shoes?  Should I just sell shoes?  Shining new shoes?  Maybe I should just disappear.  Maybe it's my fault.  Maybe I led you to believe it was easy when it wasn't.  Maybe I made you think my highlights started at the free throw line and not in the gym.  Maybe I made you think that every shot I took was a game winner.  That my game was built on flash and not fire.  Maybe it's my fault that you didn't see that failure gave me strength. 
[01:52:00]  That my pain was my motivation.  Maybe I led you to believe that basketball was a God-given gift and not something I worked for.  Every single day of my life.  Maybe I destroyed the game.  Or maybe you're just making excuses. 
[01:52:30]  Damn.  That beats up LeBron, huh?  A little bit.  That beats up LeBron a little bit, basically calling him a quitter.  But that fucking...  What?  It's the mellow drama of him.  I know.  Fucking basketball, shut up.  He's a great player, but it's like, who fucking cares?  You left Cleveland.  Big fucking deal.  Well, it's a big deal for the sports community.  But even they should shut their fucking faces.  What are you surprised?  He went and joined a super team instead of doing what Jordan did and just kind of waited for his title. 
[01:53:00]  I'll be honest with you.  Nothing, no game, justifies the dramatic fucking bullshit that shit is in that commercial.  It's a fucking game.  They're all full of shit, fans and players.  Let me tell you, let's say LeBron had hurt his shoulder.  And let's say all of a sudden in Cleveland he was averaging six points a game and two rebounds, and he never recovered.  Where would your loyalty be after fucking eight weeks of that?  And then you realized it would never get better?  You'd be like, get rid of that motherfucker, fuck. 
[01:53:30]  Yep.  And he's got no loyalty.  Nobody in sports has any loyalty, so fuck all of you.  Stop bellyaching.  Fuck all y'all.  Really?  Like, just get over it.  Well, so far it's not working out for him, because he went down to Miami to get a championship with the super team, and they're like barely 500.  Exactly.  Fuck him, too.  I think they're nine and...  They're seven and nine.  No, they're not.  Cleveland is.  Yeah, Cleveland.  No, I'm sorry.  Miami's like nine and eight.  You are sorry.  What?  Yeah, look up...  Miami's...  What are you, just yelling out numbers?  They're six and 43.  Miami's yelling out digits. 
[01:54:00]  Cleveland's seven and nine.  I'm turning my mic off.  Miami's ten and eight.  Ten and eight, so...  Ten, 47, nine.  This is probably going a little too deep, but they're saying the chemistry between the boys down there in Miami is not that great.  But they're going to blame the coach and probably fire him in the next few weeks.  Good for him.  Don't worry.  It'll take a while to settle in.  So you got your Christmas decorations.  That was a little off-roading.  I'm sorry.  No, that's fine.  But it's all set up nice?  That's pretty much it.  Yeah, now I get the inside done, because that's just the outside, and the inside is more electricity. 
[01:54:30]  A big trip, because I have my Christmas party every year, which, by the way, you're cordially invited.  Oh, thank you.  When is it?  Of course.  It's actually Christmas Day.  Who could go Christmas Day?  Well, it's...  I can.  I'm not doing it.  Everybody comes by, drops in.  I would love to go Christmas Day.  They do like a Christmas Day thing, and then they drop in.  It's kind of a come-and-go thing all day long.  You'd like to drop in his house?  I'd like to sit in the parking lot in his driveway and come in a fucking Dixie cup,  and then just leave it on his kitchen table and walk out. 
[01:55:00]  Fuck you and your decorations.  You don't decorate your house, Jimmy?  No!  Why?  We're going to put a bulb?  Here's a bunch of Christmas balls.  I do a little tree.  I do a little tree.  I don't.  Paying the ass to drag down the street with no one helping you whatsoever.  I like the whole Christmas-y, like, decoration.  I'm not like Mr. Fucking Joy to the World Christmas guy.  Of course you're not.  But, no.  You're just the opposite. 
[01:55:30]  I am.  I'm misery to the world.  But I like kind of the Christmassy look.  I like having decorations up and lights and candles and the fire in the fireplace going.  I've turned into a candle faggot.  I just like a good candle.  Dude, I'm with you.  Don't you just like a good candle?  I love a good candle.  And my girlfriend and I have opposite tastes on what smells good.  Okay, faggot!  What smell does she like and what smell do you like? 
[01:56:00]  She likes, I think, more like a citrus-y smell.  Like, she likes cleaner scents.  Like, I like...  You like cuckold?  Yeah, exactly.  I like sweaty, humiliated husband.  No, I like...  I like nice-smelling laundry scents.  I do, too.  Oh, that's...  Like, what's...  There's one called...  Clean cotton.  Clean cotton, yes.  Yeah, vanilla's a good scent.  She hates vanilla.  She hates cinnamon.  Vanilla is very good.  It could be overpowering.  They smell like body odor.  Really?  Vanilla is...  Cinnamon?  Vanilla's a good one. 
[01:56:30]  Vanilla's a good one.  I like holiday motif candles.  Like a Christmas tree scent?  Like, Christmassy...  I like Christmassy candles.  Halloween has, like, kind of...  Some kind of fucking weird pumpkin pie-smelling thing.  Did you guys smell the Entenmann's candles?  No way.  Do you just want to fucking take a bite out of them?  You just basically want to start eating the candles.  Yeah, that's sick.  I thought you were going to say,  do you want to just fuck the candles?  You just want to fuck that candle.  You kind of do.  You want to shove that candle up your asshole.  What do they smell like?  Just things that Entenmann's makes,  like fucking apple things and chocolate chip cookies 
[01:57:00]  and, like, buttery pound cake.  Dude, it's fucking...  Do they have crumb cake?  I wouldn't want that.  I don't want it to make me hungry.  It will.  I'm so fat, I want something lighter.  Anything better than an Entenmann's fucking crumb cake?  Dude, I would fucking...  Original, by the way.  Let's not fuck with the recipe.  I would cancel Ozzy if I could eat one of those right now.  Oh, God.  Let's get one.  And just their regular donuts with the chocolate on it.  And the chocolate almost cracks when you bite into it.  It's nice.  Oh, so good.  I'm not going to eat anymore.  I wouldn't know.  It's the new Jim Norton. 
[01:57:30]  You just don't eat it.  It's getting shaped Jimmy.  Getting shaped Jimmy?  Yeah.  You're getting shaped Jimmy?  I sure am.  Why is Ozzy here, Oli?  Oh, he's...  Butter pound cake.  Butter pound cake candle?  I didn't look.  I wanted to.  Holy shit, that's crazy.  I wanted to.  I wanted to, but I had to.  Yeah.  I, Jimmy, had a look.  That's so funny.  I just wanted to see how strong he was.  I'm not looking.  I was like, fuck, he got me so mad.  Can I put one of your water, Jimmy?  No, it's for Ozzy. 
[01:58:00]  Yeah.  All right, we're being called faggots really badly.  Yeah, we're like, that's new?  That's fucking...  Really badly.  You know what?  Fuck you, you cocksuckers.  They, like, these fucking fags never had a goddamn candle in the house.  I bet you they enjoy a nice candle, too.  Don't have a wife or a girlfriend that lights candles, and then what do they turn around?  Hey, cunt, put the fucking candle on.  Shut up.  You're all a bunch of phony fucking assholes.  God, our fans are dickbags.  Thank you. 
[01:58:30]  Good point, faggot.  I know I am a fruit.  I do love a good candle, though.  Yeah.  Fuck yeah, man.  Yeah, it makes the house smell nice.  Doesn't it?  Yeah.  What is this?  Oh.  Is this some kind of...  Yanni!  Yanni?  So you could light a candle and...  Get a massage, and the girl goes over the little cyst on your back and head over your  asshole.  Ladies and gentlemen, this is Keys to the Imagination.  I own this CD.  I still own it.  Dude, I've been jerked off in this CD. 
[01:59:00]  Have you really?  Do you know how much fucking seed I've armed to this fucking thing?  Strum, strum.  Brr.  Oh, my God.  Opie wants Popeye's biscuit-flavored candles.  That would be heaven right there.  Popeye's biscuit-flavored?  Anything Popeye's.  Popeye's should come out with fucking candles.  Fried chicken-smelling candles.  Yeah.  That's okay.  I'll just tap this a few times.  Hey, Travis.  For an hour.  I think Travis is tired today.  Why? 
[01:59:30]  We had this whole holiday discussion, and I didn't hear my song.  I didn't hear my song today.  No!  I didn't hear my song today.  But I had it ready.  Don't worry.  Oh, no.  Come on.  You brought up Christmas, and you got your Christmas decorations going up at the compound.  It's only fitting.  You will never hear that fucking song.  Oh, fuck.  That's true.  Gosh.  Let me enjoy it.  Fa-la-la-la-la.  Fa-la-la-la-la.  It doesn't matter how many times I hear it.  I'm never going to like it.  Fa-la-la-la-la. 
[02:00:00]  Fa-la-la-la-la.  Fa-la-la-la-la.  Fa-la-la-la-la.  Can't get an erection.  Fa-la-la-la-la-la.  Oh, stop it.  Why the Sourpuss?  Ah, I'm not a Sourpuss.  This song sucks.  This guy should be an icon.  An American icon.  You know what would be more Christmassy?  To have that little Waterhead Baby ornament on my fucking tree.  I'd rather have that than this fucking song playing in my house.  It would pull your whole tree down.  It certainly would.  All right, shh. 
[02:00:30]  Oh.  He like a million miles.  The affected voice.  Oh, that's his voice.  He's trying too hard.  That's his real voice.  That's his real voice.  He's trying too hard to be fucking meaningful.  And you can hear it.  It's phony.  It comes off as fucking phony.  I hate this.  Shut up, the children in the light.  Yay.  Oh, good.  Oh, Uncle Paul.  You like him in the dark.  Sure do.  All right, this is my favorite part.  If it's the end. 
[02:01:00]  Yeah.  Slipped on her underpants, phalala-la-la.  You'll bribe out those memories, phalala-la-la-la.  Grabs your dick like a glove, phalala-la-la.  Parents beat your door down, phalala-la-la-la.  Lie to the judge, phalala-la-la-la.  Come inside the diapers, phalala-la-la-la.  Blood on your fingers, phalala-la-la-la.  Blood on your thighs, phalala-la-la.  I like to sit out on the mirror. 
[02:01:30]  Bounce him in my lap.  Milkshake by the heinies, phalala-la-la.  Tell the mother that she fell, phalala-la-la-la.  Put a heinie on a railroad spike, phalala-la-la-la.  Take him to the hospital, phalala-la-la-la.  Lie to the doctor, phalala-la-la-la.  Stitches in their little heinies, phalala-la-la. 
[02:02:00]  Inflatable donuts, phalala-la-la-la.  Sleeping on your stomach now, phalala-la-la-la.  Talking to your therapist, phalala-la-la-la.  I gotta move again now, phalala-la-la-la.  Who's this, Megan, phalala-la-la-la.  My picture's on everyone's door, phalala-la-la-la.  Community notification, phalala-la-la-la.  He's gonna hate Jim's books, phalala-la-la-la. 
[02:02:30]  Now that's a version I could get behind there.  You just ruined the sleeve's Christmas song.  Oh, thank God.  I'll never forgive you.  Oh, shit.  For the people that have a soul, check out his sledding video with his son.  Oh, fuck.  Who's sledding video?  Sleeps me in a sledding video.  Do you really?  Great.  I hope it's got something to do with Pet Sematary.  He's a very talented man.  A little gauge.  He slides right under the truck.  He's a very talented man.  Can we see the video? 
[02:03:00]  No, you're not gonna like it.  I would like it, dude.  You're not gonna like it.  Oh, is it tender and fucking shit?  It sure is, Anthony.  It sure is.  Oh, blow it out your ass, sleeves.  I want to see what sleeves look like.  That's what he looks like.  What, a creep?  You've never seen the Coke Logic animation for the Christmas song?  No, I can't listen to it.  Why?  Because it stinks.  It's horrible.  It's an infected piece of crap.  It should be playing on one of the Christmas stations.  Oh, it should not.  Christmas channels here. 
[02:03:30]  Try to get it on one of the Christmas channels, will ya?  Trying too hard, fa-la-la-la, to sound sincere, fa-la-la-la.  Shut up.  No one laughs at my jokes.  La-la-la-la.  Oh, Jim.  Everyone says I suck.  I think sleeves has his own website.  Sherwin.  He doesn't have a lot of followers on Twitter.  He should have a lot more followers than that.  What does he say?  Sherwin sleeves?  Sherwin sleeves.  Exactly.  Sherwin.  No, it's that bad.  Sherwin sleeves. 
[02:04:00]  It's a specialty paint.  You only paint the end of your arms with this.  Get it, sleeves?  While you find that, I got a jih on the line.  This is our friend David, who's in Israel, and he wants to tell us that his holiday is  certainly not sad, Anthony.  Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, da-da-da-da-da.  Yes, sir.  My Jewish friend.  Good morning, boys.  Wonderful holiday.  Mazel tov.  Wait, is this the official video of the La La La La song?  Hold on, what's that?  No, it's a minute. 
[02:04:30]  Who is that?  That's sleeves.  That's one of my little secrets, Gary.  That's like a mad scientist.  What is he?  He sounds like Orson Welles.  What does he do?  He's got a little Orson Welles thing.  Where did he come from?  Who is this guy?  He's a Rana Fez guy.  What is he, though?  I wish he was an O&A guy.  I like the sleeves.  I like the sleeves.  You don't want a man?  What does he do?  I don't know what he does.  We'll give Rana Fez Bobo and Blind Stevie for sleeves.  No, I can't.  We'll give him Bobo a grade.  That's a good trade. 
[02:05:00]  Nah, not Bobo.  Feeling pretty good for the La La La La.  How about we give them fucking Bobo and fucking Blind Stevie for just nothing?  For nothing.  For two of Fez's beard hairs.  Let's give him Bobo and anal fissures.  I don't want Sleeves.  Nor do I.  Fa la la la la la.  I like the sleeves.  I like the sleeves.  Sleeves is awful.  Feeling pretty good.  Are you?  Yeah.  Feeling pretty good. 
[02:05:30]  Fa la la la.  Fa la la la.  For what?  For what?  The world has a way of beating you down, man.  And Sleeves is just trying to tell everyone to take a step back and breathe and relax.  No, that's not what that song is doing.  Let's get him on the phone.  He'll tell us.  It's not what that song is fucking doing.  I don't think we should have him on the phone.  You don't want it at all.  That would be a mistake, I think.  I don't know.  I just don't see it going well.  I understand the sleeves and the la la la la.  I don't.  Do you?  Fa la la la la.  Let's just take a breath and relax a little bit.  No. 
[02:06:00]  I can't take him.  Take in the holiday.  He annoys me.  He annoys me.  Why is he?  The voice, the fucking, what is he?  I'm feeling pretty good.  Oh, God.  Dr. Steve texted me.  I have a part in Sleeves' new one-man show based on a Christmas carol.  Very good, Steve.  That can't be true.  Fluid buildups.  Seepage into the womb.  Oh, radioghost.com.  Thank you.  Pull the muscle. 
[02:06:30]  You were there?  Take your Valtrex.  All right.  Can we talk to the J about Hanukkah?  David and Israel.  My Jewish friend.  David, we think your holiday is all about the suffering.  There it is.  Why is it all about the suffering?  Exactly.  Sir, I wasn't saying that Hanukkah is about suffering, but many of the Jewish holidays are  about suffering and hard times.  You know I like to kvetch a little bit? 
[02:07:00]  What's that?  You know I like to kvetch every once in a while?  Yes, I know you like to kvetch.  Like when my garbage pails blow down the street because the winds are very strong.  And I'll hear kvetching about them being in front of someone's house.  It's just the way we are overall, like, I think we're very happy people.  Why the unleavened bread?  Why are you yelling?  Why?  Why not with the bitter herbs?  What?  Get enough oil.  There's plenty of oil in this day and age. 
[02:07:30]  Plenty of oil.  You can celebrate the fact that now there's plenty of oil for the lamp.  That is true.  That's part of the celebration.  You don't need a miracle to get a bunch of days out of, you know...  That is true.  ...one little bit of oil.  You don't.  You're in Israel, right?  Yes.  And it's also an excuse for vacation.  I get paid on Passover and Sukkot.  I get a full paid vacation.  What's up with the voice?  Were you on a bus?  No, it is...  That's how he talks.  You know how hard it is to pull mezuzahs off a door when you're Catholic and you move 
[02:08:00]  into a Jewish neighborhood?  Do you know how hard it is to pull mezuzahs off the doors?  Those things don't come off.  They're painted on with 80 layers of paint.  Do you know there's a little scroll in those things?  Yeah, I know.  I read it like I thought it was a fortune cookie.  After that, I feel so bad for you.  Give me your millions and I'll come down and pick them all off for you.  Ah, look, look.  He's trying to get my money.  They're always trying to get your money.  Boy, what are you doing, sir?  David, is there different yarmulkes? 
[02:08:30]  Because this guy, I'm telling you, I was following him and it was windy and he was obsessed that  he wasn't wearing the right yarmulke for a windy day.  I don't think there's any specific for different days.  If it's not clipped down and it's small, then it's going to be flying everywhere.  It's the yarmulke with the spoiler on the back.  It's like ground effects.  Hey, I don't like the little hair clip things.  I think it's kind of a little feminine on the guys when they wear the, not even the  bobby pins are bad enough, but sometimes they use those barrettes and stuff. 
[02:09:00]  They're called barrettes.  I don't care.  Get it straight.  Yeah.  You guys wear barrettes.  Yeah.  Feeling pretty good for the la, la, la, la.  All right, David.  You didn't convince us that your holiday is joyful.  It's good for me.  I get several days of paid vacation.  I get presents every single night and I get to chill and relax and you guys got to work  every single day.  Yeah, but the presents aren't really good.  Terrible.  And Christmas, we get a bunch of presents all at once and Hanukkah, you get one one day, 
[02:09:30]  one the next day and it's like, ah, you open one thing and it's...  If Uncle Paul's around, you know you're going to get good presents.  Why?  Yeah, what do you mean?  Jimmy, I'm not falling for it.  Punch it out.  What day is it in Israel?  It's Tuesday.  Same day as you.  Same day.  It's 3.45 in the afternoon.  We're seven hours ahead of you.  3.45.  Time is different, fa-la-la-la-la. 
[02:10:00]  They already live this time, fa-la-la-la-la.  See, you're getting into it.  I can tell.  Oh, never.  Never.  Why?  Thank you, David.  Good.  All right, there goes David.  Oh, my God.  No, I can't take that song.  I hate it.  It doesn't make me feel Christmassy.  And I like...  Oh, God.  No, not again.  I hate this.  Fuck.  I was feeling pretty good for la-la-la-la.  What?  Taking my time on the la-la-la-la.  On the la-la-la-la.  Right there.  It tells me it's a piece of shit. 
[02:10:30]  He's taking his time on the la-la-la-la.  You tell me what that means.  Tell me what it means.  Taking my time on the la-la-la-la.  I think people forgot what the meaning of Christmas is.  No, it doesn't mean that.  It's taking his time.  It doesn't matter where you're going.  It's not rushing around and getting those gifts and dealing with the people in the mall.  He's like, why don't you just fucking take time to feel the spirit of Christmas.  That is the spirit of Christmas.  Gifts.  Gimme.  I'm sick of the spirit of Christmas. 
[02:11:00]  It's overrated.  Yes.  It's not even Christ's birthday.  No.  That's what he's getting at.  No, but the spirit of Christmas...  That we forgot what it's really about.  No, meaning December 25th is not really Jesus' birthday.  No.  They speculate he was born some other time.  Of course.  So gifts are...  That is what it's about.  It is.  Gimme gifts.  I know that Jimmy's ancestors brought the baby Jesus 18 pounds of frankincense and myrrh.  Yes, they did.  And myrrh.  Yeah, and he said, where's myrrh?  And they threw Gavin McLeod on him.  Doing lousy jokes, fa-la-la-la-la. 
[02:11:30]  Outdated references, fa-la-la-la-la.  1976 asshole, la-la-la-la.  How about you watch his show from the later 90s?  All right.  Please, I hate it.  All right, we'll tell you.  It's killing me.  I don't want you to ruin the song.  Has Richard Dreyfuss got anything going on?  Yeah.  I don't know, man.  It's male pattern baldness.  Oh, my God.  He went bald, though, to a certain level, and then it just stopped. 
[02:12:00]  We only get him when he has a shitty movie to promote, unfortunately.  I'm praying that he gets another shitty movie out there soon, so we can say hi to him again.  Holy God.  Shitty movie.  We had him for the Poseidon Adventure, which should have been a great movie, a great remake.  Wow.  Hey, also, to go all the way back to the Eddie Vedder thing that started this whole break.  I forgot.  He did Hard Son.  His greatest solo song is Hard Son, which is a remake.  I forgot the band that did this originally in the late 80s or maybe early 90s. 
[02:12:30]  And this is from the movie Into the Wild.  It's a great song.  Is it?  I think so.  He sounds like Neil Diamond.  He sounds like Neil Diamond in this.  Anthony can ruin anything with one sentence. 
[02:13:00]  I know.  I could get Jimmy to download this fucking song.  I know.  Oh, Pat, be enjoying it, and then you just spoiled it.  Let's get to the hook, and I think Jimmy will download it.  Here's the hook.  Here's the hook.  A big hard son.  Being on the big people.  In the big hard world.  Yeah.  When she comes to greet me, she is mercy at my feet.  This is great, but he does sound like Neil Diamond. 
[02:13:30]  He's trying to change up his voice a little bit.  And it's the music, too.  And I want to thank Kevin from Connecticut.  Yes, Indio was the original.  I used to know that.  You want to hear the original version?  No.  It was on the radio for a day.  All right.  Let's hear it.  Yeah, I don't know this.  Just for reference.  And what year was it, Travis?  1989.  89.  Oh, geez.  What a ripoff.  It sounds like the same song.  Oh.  Yeah.  But no one knew that it was a remake when Eddie Vedder put that out.  Yeah. 
[02:14:00]  I shouldn't say no one, but most people didn't know.  When I walk beside her, I am a better man.  This version is actually better.  Why did I just use it?  I love to leave her.  I always stagger back again.  Once I built an opera tower, so I could worship from above.  It's so vague.  I, I, I, it sounds vaguely familiar, but she took me in again.  And the Eddie Vedder version, I have no idea. 
[02:14:30]  Yeah, I kind of remember this.  I think if you asked 99% of the people out there, they wouldn't know Eddie Vedder remade this.  No, that's what I'm saying.  Indio got fucked.  One of their big songs remade by Eddie Vedder, no one knew.  No one knows.  I think it faded out.  I like it.  It's no Aussie, right, Jimmy?  Well, they're different. 
[02:15:00]  I'm looking at the Aussie bio that Sam wrote up.  Some real, um, humdinger information.  Oh, is there?  Well, now you gotta, uh, understand, Jimmy, you are an expert, so.  No, no, but this is good, this is good fodder for conversation.  Aussie has sold over 100 million records as a solo act and with Black Sabbath.  What are their lines, one through ten, and you just have to fill them in?  So, Aussie, you've sold over 100 million records.  Yeah, man.  Could you name everyone who's bought one? 
[02:15:30]  Because otherwise, I don't know why this is here.  Yeah, why is that there?  It's, uh, it's something to pump you up about, uh, Aussie?  I don't think you need that.  Any other tidbits?  The Osbournes won an Emmy in 2003.  Good, we could bring that up.  Sure.  So, uh, did you, are you aware that you won an Emmy?  Yes.  In 2003?  Yeah.  Hey.  Hey, can I go to Eddie?  The book, uh, the book you got him was only three years old then. 
[02:16:00]  I can't wait for the giving of the gifts.  Oh, boy.  Eddie in Chicago, go ahead.  Hey, I just want to know, when did Opie become the nicer of the two of you guys?  Remember when he used to just throw poker chips at people's heads?  Yeah, I don't know what's up with Anthony.  He hates everything.  He has no soul.  Anthony has no soul.  No, I'm just a realist.  Oh, that was that chick.  I thought she looked familiar.  She looks really fucking good when she cleans up, man.  Good Day New York has that, uh, subway perv girl. 
[02:16:30]  The one that she's talking.  We arrived at 42nd Street.  When the car doors opened, the transit police wasn't there, so I had to keep, I knew that  I had to keep making a scene to call attention to what he was trying to do to me.  We just found out her name from watching television.  Make sure that he was contained within the car until police came.  You said you were, you enlisted fellow passengers.  They were poised to help.  They were on your side, clearly.  They were amazing, and I just want to say New Yorkers are incredible.  I consider myself a New Yorker now, having been here long enough, and they guarded the door.  They shamed him, as anyone who would try such a thing should be shamed. 
[02:17:00]  Well, Nicola, very impressive.  Well done.  She's got big thumbs.  51-year-old Mario Valdivia again was arrested, and he is going to be deported.  You don't look bad.  And this is not the first time he's done something like this, we are told.  Nicola, we from Virginia.  Pennsylvania.  Wow.  You teach Tai Chi privately.  What do you do?  Actually, I teach privately.  I also teach at a Tai Chi school in Westchester.  I'm the head instructor there at the Tai Chi School of Westchester.  I have a consultancy called Tai Chi for Everyone, in which I go around full-time and work in the health care system. 
[02:17:30]  I'll put my dick out in the dojo.  Thank you very much.  Don't mess with her.  Good day, New York is coming.  She's wearing sexy boots and everything.  Why couldn't she be something else?  Well, I'm a scat mistress.  Yeah.  Scat mistress.  I drop solid lungs on people and shame them.  How great is it to deport that piece of shit?  Good.  Tai Chi is the stuff the old people do in the commercials for the fucking bone building shit.  Well, they do that in this park.  You see these fucking...  Oh, do they?  Oh, yeah.  Do people do this in the park?  Yeah.  Roger Clemens is a big Tai Chi guy. 
[02:18:00]  It's supposed to be good for you.  I don't know what it does.  What are you waving at?  I don't know.  Hello.  Good evening.  Welcome.  Come in.  Yeah.  Whenever you see a massage therapist, by the way, gesture in a Tai Chi motion, you know your cock is being untouched.  There's nothing worse than when you walk in and they say, welcome to my space, and they gesture you.  And you're like, right.  Oh, really?  You're like, what did he say yesterday?  She ain't touching my nuts.  Proper draping?  I despise proper draping.  That's what it is.  Proper draping.  I laughed at that all afternoon.  I loathe proper draping. 
[02:18:30]  Proper draping.  Believe me.  Fucking shit on my shoe is a sexier term in a massage studio.  Look at that wacky walk thing she's doing.  I don't really know what it does.  Clemens did it, though, for years, I think.  I'm starting to get yoga a little bit.  I'm starting to get meditation a little bit.  But this, I don't know, man.  I should do it.  What are you doing?  Doesn't it look like something you could just, like, watch?  You could watch this for, like, ten minutes and go in the park and completely pull it off.  Sure.  Unless somebody really knows what they're doing.  Like, anyone looking at you would be like, oh, look, that person's doing Tai Chi or something. 
[02:19:00]  Whenever I watch Tai Chi, I just want to do this.  Hurry up!  Why are you in slow motion?  Hurry up!  Get to it already!  You're making me feel like I'm in water.  You're making me feel like I'm on drugs, madam.  I like learning shit, though.  What does it do?  For real?  Oh, it's got to be some kind of balance and fucking discipline and muscle fucking disciplines. 
[02:19:30]  In other words, it's all horse shit.  Yeah.  Where is she on that?  Where's pictures of her?  That's her webpage?  Let me see that bitch.  Is that her?  She looks like shit in that picture.  No, that's not her.  She's not a big part of the school, is she?  She's the head instructor.  Oh, she said that?  Head.  Let's see.  That's her?  Yeah.  She don't look that good in that.  She's horrible.  She doesn't look as good in that picture as she just did on the television.  That's right.  Well, she's a fucking Tai Chi bitch.  She was shaming that guy because he showed his penis.  She was berating that gentleman. 
[02:20:00]  Oh, yeah.  She looks awful there.  That's right.  That's her right there?  Is that her with the short hair?  She had to whip herself into shape.  Come on.  Holy shit.  Is she fucking awful?  Oh, my God.  How did they get her into shape?  She looks like Austin Powers.  She does.  That horrible fucking short blonde dude.  And look at her hefty legs.  Yeah, she has fat Irish girl legs.  Not good.  Big fucking sausage legs.  Boy, did we turn on her real quick.  It's amazing.  Some guy assaulted her by showing his cock, and we're like, she's ugly. 
[02:20:30]  And like three minutes ago, we're talking about how hot she looks.  We're a very shallow group.  She wasn't assaulted.  Terrible.  No, but that's a visual assault.  You pull your cock out at somebody.  It was just a silly maneuver on his part.  Silly maneuver?  Yes.  Is that a legal term?  Yes.  I think it is assault.  It'll be in the courts.  Hey, Danny, what's this Arizona quarterback Dirk Anderson thing all about?  Because I don't know.  I think Travis might be better on this one.  Okay.  So at some point during last night's Monday Night Football game between the Cardinals 
[02:21:00]  and the 49ers, the Cardinals were getting blown out.  I heard it was a horrible game.  It was terrible.  I didn't watch any of it.  What was the final score?  27 to 6.  Okay.  So I guess at some point the cameras panned over to Derek Anderson, the Cardinals quarterback,  on the sidelines, and he was like joking around with one of the other players.  So this is the post-game press conference, and one of the reporters asks him why he was  kind of laughing while his team was getting embarrassed.  And you know what?  This goes right back to what you guys were saying about sports in general.  It's not that important in the end. 
[02:21:30]  So why can't the guy joke around when the game is obviously over?  What is he supposed to do?  Are you just supposed to be all like, oh, the whole time?  Yeah.  I'm so angry.  What were you saying in that instance that you were trying to be popular?  It was funny.  And I don't mean this to be sarcastic or pointed, but, I mean,  that went out on Monday night television, a lot of fiction.  What is that?  Sports center.  Yeah, it's the sound of the graphics and stuff coming in now.  Holy shit.  Wow, without seeing it? 
[02:22:00]  It's just really bad if you don't see it.  Oh, there was a robot there.  I forgot to tell you.  A robot.  Enough with the fucking graphics.  Zoom.  I hate that Fox thing where they make the turkey robot dance.  Who fucking laughs at that?  The robot's back, and he's dancing.  What about the NASCARs?  We don't need any of that shit.  Or the NASCAR car, would it be?  Or can I say NASCARs?  And they do a little spin out in the middle of your show.  I'm like, what the fuck is going on?  They do a burnout.  Too many graphics for la la la. 
[02:22:30]  It was bad enough when they would just kind of put it in the side.  Yeah.  And then it would go away.  Now people walk onto the screen in the middle of a show.  They walk on.  They put their hands on their hips.  They point at you and wave their finger.  And then a title comes up.  Our pal.  More your pal.  But he's a pal.  Well, Adam Ferrara walked onto my TV the other day.  I know.  It's annoying.  I was watching Woodstock now and then, or then and now, then and then and now.  And all of a sudden, Adam Ferrara and his buddies walk onto my TV.  Yeah.  What did he say? 
[02:23:00]  And then he turns his head like, oh, I'm going to check out the show.  Yeah.  Oh, let me look at the show.  And then he gives his pal an elbow, and he checks out the show.  And then a graphic comes on.  Oh, I'm distracted because I'm watching Adam walk onto my TV to check out the show that  I'm watching.  Because he's on Top Gear.  And then he either, like, disappeared in thin air or walked off or forget.  The worst one ever was about a, I guess it was about a year and a half ago, two years  ago.  TBS was having the Bill Ingvall show.  And where he would walk onto the screen, and like, with like a remote, and he would hit 
[02:23:30]  pause.  Yeah.  And the fucking show that you were watching would stop.  Holy shit.  That's not how you get people to watch your show.  Well, yeah, they stopped that shit real quick.  Oh, good.  And he would talk about his show, and then he'd be like, oh, all right, let's watch the  rest of this.  And you're like, are you fucking kidding me?  Oh, my God.  Commercial.  You forced me to fucking sit through that.  How do you get up at all the laughs with the Bill Ingvall show?  How do you move on?  I know.  Really?  Imagine if it was like during, they didn't even plan, they just did it during awful things.  Like a news story about a kid who was born with no legs, and Bill Ingvall comes  on and talks about his show.  Tries to get some chuckles. 
[02:24:00]  Exactly.  The Woodstock thing?  It's the History Channel.  You got me watching the dumb History Channel.  Love the History Channel.  Discovery, all those channels.  Do you know there's a lady?  Who knows?  All the glitters is gold.  That's right.  You know what?  She's buying something.  She's buying a stepladder to the attic.  Because she has a bug problem.  She has bed bugs in her attic.  Those are the original lyrics.  Before they stole it from a Negro. 
[02:24:30]  Yeah.  And she's buying a stepladder to get some sweet potato pie or whatever it is black people  enjoy.  Do they enjoy sweet potatoes?  They love sweet potato pie.  All that glitters is gold.  Plink, plink, plink.  Plink, plink.  I want the gold.  There's a lady from Woodstock.  She's known as the peanut butter and jelly lady.  And that's her claim to fame for the last, what, how many years now?  40 years?  What was that?  She had her period and that's what her underwear looked like? 
[02:25:00]  She was shitting her pants for three days.  Hippy bitch.  Hope she gets hit by a dump truck.  Fucking hairy pits.  They have to lay her out in her hairy pits.  You know, the other jelly panties.  She heard the kids were starving, so she took it upon herself to make maybe a couple dozen  sandwiches and half a million people with them.  For now, for 41 years, she's been known as the peanut butter and jelly lady.  Exactly.  And she was excited on this dumb show going, if you Google me, it comes up as the peanut 
[02:25:30]  butter and jelly lady lady.  You know what's worse is that she's fucking liverwurst lady, hung herself eight years ago  and nobody knows.  Nobody paid attention to liverwurst lady.  They made slippers out of her sandwiches.  They hated her.  They hated her liverwurst.  Tied them to their filthy feet so they could walk in the mud.  Her round hunks of liverwurst were made into shoes.  They could walk in a port-a-potties with dirty hippies.  Filthy woodstock hippies.  Nice dirty scalp, idiot.  Watch the whole fucking thing, too.  I don't know why.  Just fucking in that filthy lake. 
[02:26:00]  Exactly.  Oh, yeah, they were.  That awful fucking field.  Shave you, pussy.  That's her.  There's peanut butter and jelly lady.  That's peanut butter and jelly lady.  She's proud that she's doing it for that.  She looks like Sally Jesse Raphael, peanut butter and jelly lady.  That should be her name.  How many dumb sandwiches did she make?  Two.  Everybody took a nibble.  It was like when they were on a boat from Cuba and this one woman's breast milk keeps  11 people alive.  Why don't you just stay in Cuba?  What's worse than drinking breast milk 80 miles from shore? 
[02:26:30]  Do they have an older picture of a peanut butter and jelly lady?  Because she looks like a fucking realtor in that one.  Yeah, I don't know.  They have a hippie picture of her?  Back what she looked like when she was dishing out the peanut butter and jelly?  Bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah.  Satisfying all the people's dogs that were brought to fucking Woodstock.  And she didn't cut the ends off, fa-la-la-la-la.  I don't like the ends, the crusts, fa-la-la.  See, you're getting into the song.  I know.  No.  It sucks. 
[02:27:00]  All right, fuck her.  Will you download Hard Sun now?  Eddie Vedder's version there, Jimmy?  You got a new song for her?  I would, yeah.  I think you would.  No.  I'm so, that's peanut butter and jelly lady?  All right, enough, who cares?  Okay, here's the quarterback with the press conference and the graphics.  The graphics.  You know, that went out on Monday night television.  A lot of fans are talking about it right now as a big problem with this team.  Can you put into context what was going on at that moment?  What caused you?  What Deuce and I talk about is nobody else's business.  But why was something funny when you're down 18 points in the fourth quarter? 
[02:27:30]  It wasn't funny.  I wasn't laughing about anything.  The camera showed you laughing.  Okay, that's fine.  That's fine.  That's fine.  And Coach Gruden commented about it.  That's fine.  That's fine.  I'm not laughing about it.  You think this is funny?  I take this shit serious.  I'm not.  I'm real serious.  I put my heart and soul into this shit every single week.  All I'm saying is the camera showed you laughing.  I'm just telling you right now what I do every single week.  Every single week.  I put my freaking heart and soul into this.  I study my ass off.  I don't go out there and laugh.  It's not funny.  Nothing's funny to me.  I don't want to go out there and get embarrassed on Monday night football in front of everybody. 
[02:28:00]  That's why I'm asking you what was...  I'm telling you right now.  We're talking.  Deuce and I are talking.  What was the context in which...  I'm sorry.  I'm not dealing with that.  Good for him to fucking talk to that shit reporter like that.  Good.  Bravo.  But again, this fucking lunkhead didn't handle it right either.  He should have just said, look, we were losing.  It was a moment.  Because these guys are sick of the bullshit questions that you have to deal with every  day.  Because he's a reporter.  From these assholes that have never even played the sport.  The reporter said to him, well, what were you... 
[02:28:30]  I'm not trying to say anything, but what were you saying?  And when the guy didn't...  But he was as soon as he said that.  Because when the guy didn't give him the answer he wanted, then he goes, well, you're  down 18 points.  Then the reporters show what a cunt he was.  He was being passive aggressive.  Of course he was.  How he said that to Christ.  How he said that to Christ.  How he had business with what we were talking about?  What are you talking about with your wife?  Go fuck yourself.  Right.  What is he supposed to do?  I'm a man.  Cry on the sidelines?  Game's over.  It's a game.  Oh, you mean we didn't run the ball as far as the other team?  I make six million a year.  Of course I laughed.  He did diffuse the whole thing by getting pissed off, though. 
[02:29:00]  Good.  Like, he was trying to tell the reporter, like, no, nothing, nothing.  And then he realized, I just got to lay into this guy to have him shut up.  Yeah.  Sports guys, I think they shut reporters up pretty easily when they get in their face  because they're just big and dangerous and scary.  And reporters are little worms.  They really are fucking weasels.  They are.  All right, we'll take a break.  We're getting close to the big Ozzy interview.  I got a text from my girl.  This is how fucking manic life is for me. 
[02:29:30]  I get a text, and she's like, I couldn't stop dreaming about Ozzy.  And I'm like, what were you dreaming?  And she's like, it was more like you were bombarding into my dreams and kept talking about Ozzy,  and you kept calling him to tell him stuff.  Oh, fuck.  You talk about Ozzy a lot in front of her?  I guess I do.  That's what that's about.  And Jimmy's got his 18 pounds of birthday gifts.  Dude, I so want to not give him that.  I'm so embarrassed.  You have to now.  He's going to hate me.  No, he's going to love you. 
[02:30:00]  No, he won't.  He'll think I'm an idiot.  He'll be polite.  He's not a dope.  He'll be nice about it.  If you're just waking up, I really suggest that you listen to the replay for the setup, because we did it by an hour.  But Jimmy basically got Ozzy gifts for his birthday.  18 pounds of books.  I'm an asshole.  But how we discussed it earlier is just, I don't listen to the replay often.  I will be listening to this.  Yeah, me too.  Because I'm tear-stricken in my car. 
[02:30:30]  I have to listen to that today.  All right.  And Justin Bieber, after the break, he did his bullying video.  We love the bullying videos.  Good.  They're great.  A bullying video?  What the fuck is this?  If you're a celebrity, you've got to make a bullying video.  Why haven't you made yours, Ant?  I'll make one.  Everyone's making a bullying video.  I've got to make one, I guess.  You have to.  It's hot to do that right now.  Is it like a PSA kind of a thing, where you're like, hi, I'm blah-dee-blah-dee-blah.  And then we'll move on to the next big topic, and all these assholes will forget about the bullying that's going on. 
[02:31:00]  Follow suit, right.  Exactly.  The Colby and Anthony Show on the virus.  Virus.  Sirius XM.  I know you want what's on my mind.  I know you like what's on my mind.  I know I need you on this side.  I know you know, you know, you know.  Ozzy's in the building.  Yeah, just saw him walk by. 
[02:31:30]  He'll be on the show in 15, 20 minutes.  Some whacking bang.  It's a big day for Jim Norton.  Oh, Jimmy's very excited.  We all know how obsessed he is with Ozzy.  Is it an obsession?  I think it's a borderline obsession.  He's an Uber fan.  What do you think?  He's got birthday gifts for Ozzy today.  Yeah, it's complete obsession.  18 pounds of birthday gifts will be given to Ozzy Osbourne within the half hour, so stay tuned for that.  But first, it's Jay Moore. 
[02:32:00]  Hiya, boys.  What's up, Jay?  Jay Moore.  It's uh, Anthony.  How are you, sir?  It's Prince Spaghetti Night, Anthony.  Hey, Wednesday's Prince Spaghetti Day.  Yeah, everyone knows it's Wednesday.  You bet your ass it is.  30 years ago.  Goddamn commercial haunted me.  That'll never go away.  No.  I like the old school STP coming in from break, boys.  STP?  Yeah, who doesn't like that?  It's no Sabbath.  Jimmy, happy birthday.  Hi, buddy.  How are you?  Uh, Jay, I gotta let you know what's going on. 
[02:32:30]  You probably heard a little bit because you're on hold, but Norton, very excited about the Ozzy Osbourne interview that's gonna go down in a few minutes here.  And, uh, he brought Ozzy birthday gifts.  Of course.  He's smart.  18 pounds worth of birthday gifts.  18 pounds.  Yeah, I'm an idiot, dude.  I brought him fucking...  Jose has got him gifts, too, like a whole bag of them, so I'm not the only one.  But I guarantee you, Jose probably got him fun, cool gifts.  He's gonna...  Ozzy's probably gonna hate these.  Ozzy, uh, Ozzy's getting 18 pounds of books from Jim Norton today.  Did you guys weigh at all?  Did you go to like...  We did weigh and weigh. 
[02:33:00]  That's why we're saying 18 pounds.  Yeah, we had a...  We got the exact weight of the gifts.  Yeah, I'm fucking...  And now we, we, we convinced Jimmy that it's just crazy to do this, so now Jimmy's doubting himself.  But we're forcing him to give up the gifts.  I think Ozzy will be super touched.  I really do.  I don't think a lot of people are like, here, Ozzy, here's a book.  I mean that in a nice...  No, no, I mean that in like a nice way.  I think Jimmy's on the right track.  I'm being completely serious.  I think he's gonna be incredibly touched.  Well, I got him... 
[02:33:30]  He's a Beatles fan, so I got him four books on the Beatles.  Like, they're like big, they're like big photo books, though.  They're not like little, you know, toilet readers.  So hopefully he'll like at least one of them.  And the good news, Jay, one of the books is ten years old.  I didn't know.  The Beatles anthology is a decade old.  One of the books is, are you there, God?  It's me, Jimmy.  I'm such a zilch.  Fudge, Fudge-o-mania.  He got him all the Judy Blume stuff.  Freckle juice.  I hope he comes in on time.  Like, he's supposed to be here in a little while. 
[02:34:00]  I hope he's done.  Jimmy's getting so edgy.  I know.  How are you getting edgy?  We talked to Ozzy a million times.  Because he has a hard out today, but it's like he's doing other shows first.  Is he doing your other show?  Possibly at this time at the end.  Oh.  Okay.  Oh.  What are you up to, Jay?  I just, I miss you boys.  I got up to pee.  I looked at my watch, and I said, you know what?  Damn it.  They're on the air right now.  I could go back to bed and keep dreaming, or I could call them.  So I decided to call instead.  Ah.  Very nice.  I have nothing to promote except where Jimmy is this weekend. 
[02:34:30]  Jimmy?  Nowhere, buddy.  I'm actually in town hanging out.  Whoa.  We didn't promote.  Make something up.  Make something up.  No, no.  We should be promoting the second show you're doing.  Yeah.  The second show added at the Borgata.  It's January 15th.  Tickets go on sale Friday morning.  Myself, Burr, Jim Brewer, Dave Attell.  First one sold out very quickly, so the second one goes on sale Friday morning.  Jesus Christ.  I need to divide up that check.  Three guys in a green room.  Nobody really wants to look at each other. 
[02:35:00]  Three guys sitting around.  Jay, when are you going to close?  I'll go.  That way I can jump up to pee or quicker.  Colin's a big star, though, man.  Doing that Broadway thing.  Time Magazine.  He nailed it, was the quote.  Yep.  Yep.  That's amazing.  God damn.  I follow you guys on Twitter, and I started following Voss on Twitter, and then I sent him  like a personal message.  And the prick didn't even like get back to me, and then he didn't even follow me, so I  stopped following Voss.  He probably didn't even read it, honestly.  He's so stupid.  He's kind of stupid. 
[02:35:30]  Voss.  Voss.  Voss guy.  His page is funny, because all he does is go wrong, you dumb cock sucker, when he  just realized that I'm smarter than you.  He just fights with people?  Is that it?  He's like, did I spell this right?  Fuck you.  And his whole Twitter page is, I'm going to be on, guess who's going to be on Joey  Behar tonight?  Well, I sound like Colin.  Guess who's going to be on Joey Behar tonight?  Me and Bonnie.  Guess who's on TMZ?  Me and Bonnie.  Like, people are like, God damn it. 
[02:36:00]  I can't peg this Voss fellow down.  We've got to see his Twitter page now.  I know.  I've got to see his fucking Twitter page.  Fuck, what's he doing?  I've never looked at his Twitter page.  I've followed the Jay Moore.  He talks about golf a lot.  I rotate everybody I follow.  There's like three people I follow constantly, and the rest of them I rotate, so I keep it  under like 20.  Yeah.  Oh, you keep it low?  Low number?  Yeah.  You see people following like 120 people.  They're following CNN news because they threw out their fucking television. 
[02:36:30]  Right.  Yeah.  I like when people follow the fake Gary Busey, the fake Jesus Christ.  Yeah.  I'm like, you know what?  I'm just going to be the fake Phil Jackson.  Took a shit today.  I was in life.  LOL.  I think the fake Gary Busey got in trouble and had to announce that he's a parody or whatever.  A fake?  Yeah.  He had to finally announce it.  And it was big news on Twitter yesterday.  Didn't he announce it when the title of his page was the fake Gary Busey?  Maybe it's the other Gary Busey, though. 
[02:37:00]  There might be a bunch of them.  There's the real, which is fake, too.  Is that the one I'm thinking of?  I don't know.  Whenever anybody says the real, sometimes that's fake.  I'm going to be the fake Adam Sandler.  And I'm just going to tweet, today was a very good day.  I started the script for grown-ups, too.  It was good.  It was good.  And I enjoyed it. 
[02:37:30]  Hello, Jimmy.  I like him.  He's good.  He's going to hate my gifts.  Oh, don't worry about your gifts.  They'll be fine.  I finally checked out.  You're going to love them.  I checked out that grown-ups movie, finally.  Holy shit.  What a bag of shit.  It's pretty impressive.  It is impressively bad.  It's pretty impressive.  Unbelievable.  I can't believe I wasn't invited.  That's how bad it was.  Oh, shit.  Hey, I'm reading Rich Voss's Twitter.  Why is it I'm at Bank of America, but I feel like I'm in India? 
[02:38:00]  What?  I'm surprised the Twitter page, the first tweet, is in,  look at the black chicks checking me out.  And then here's one of the ones you're talking about, Jay.  He goes, well, then how dumb does that make you to follow me and respond, jackass?  That's exactly what you're talking about.  He's just very combative on the Twitter.  Blocking people on Twitter really is, like, one of the most empowering things you could possibly do.  Yeah, because that's it. 
[02:38:30]  It's like, now I don't need to hear from you.  And it's odd.  It's like the old, if a tree falls in the forest and no one's there to hear it, did it really fall?  It's like, if I blocked someone that no one ever knew on Twitter, do you really exist at all?  Yeah, now you don't exist.  What did you have?  You had fucking, like, three followers.  If I would have acknowledged you, a lot of people would have seen it.  But I'd just block you.  And even when you tell people, like, suck from your motorhome in Santa Fe, I'll never know it.  Yep.  And then they get mad that you blocked them. 
[02:39:00]  Like, we're supposed to just allow them to continue, you know, spewing their bullshit, and they're not even fans.  Yeah, they follow you.  It's really confusing.  It's a weird thing being a comedian, and you guys, too, being entertainers.  Being whatever the fuck we are, right?  Yeah.  It's the only job where people can directly reach out and tell you, you fucking suck.  Yeah.  It's too bizarre for words.  It's the only reason the internet was invented.  It really is.  Yeah, I was talking about that at some point to somebody. 
[02:39:30]  I don't even know what it was, but it's much too accessible, where you used to have to write a letter and make sure it got to the person.  And now it's just, you know, hey, you're a dickbag.  You suck.  Your family sucks.  Everything.  And you're like, what the fuck?  How do you have access to me, prick?  Yeah, and then there's no recourse.  They just, they don't give a fuck.  You know, if you tell them their assholes back, they get all excited.  They're like, I saw you at the, wrote the Warcraft convention.  How many drugs were you on?  And they just spread that shit.  And you're like, what?  Yeah. 
[02:40:00]  Like, weird shit.  It doesn't even make sense.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, doh.  No, that's good.  All he's going to open up is his books, you know, and go, hi, skisham.  Aren't you, uh, Jay, aren't you coming to comics over there at Foxwoods at some point?  Uh, I think so.  Like in a while, like you said, I don't have to learn anything, Anthony. 
[02:40:30]  Oh, you.  He's just calling to say hi.  Oh, you.  Hey, are you near a computer?  When I get closer to the date, I'll swing from your nuts and gobble it up to filthy.  Gobble, gobble, gobble.  Hey, uh, are you near a computer?  Uh, no, I'm not, sir.  Are you a homosexual?  What can you do over there?  You got to check out, uh, uh, baby Klaus later today.  Oh, that's disgusting.  We're all talking about baby Klaus.  What is it?  Is it something gross?  Like your chicken?  Yes.  Yeah, it's pretty disturbing.  Horrible.  I'm not going there. 
[02:41:00]  The kid's head is probably five times the size of a normal head.  It's a kid with an oven stuffer roaster head.  Yeah.  It's a big butterball head.  Fucking.  Did you keep him in the microwave too long?  It's terrible.  It looks like it.  I had water on the brain.  We learned it wasn't born that way, but it got out of control.  So what kind of parent are you that you allow this to happen in front of your eyes and do  nothing about it?  Horrible thing.  Will this make me lose my erection?  No.  Yeah, it's very disturbing.  I'm not a fan of the baby Klaus. 
[02:41:30]  Yeah.  No?  Anthony, out of all the crew that you guys roll with, Anthony posts like the most pictures,  and it goes between like NRA photos, and then all of a sudden it's like a swinging night  at Dean Martin's house.  The crusty Charlton Heston and like the fucking gold dust girls.  That's exactly what I was going for.  Thank you.  Oh my God.  It's hysterical.  It's like, because when you're drinking, you get stinking, and it helps you the whole point  of view.  And then I'm pointing a machine gun at a raccoon. 
[02:42:00]  Yeah.  And then the next photo, it was like, he's poolside at the fucking pool.  I was like, hi, hey there, buddy boy.  Buddy boy.  How long have you been on, boy?  I did a picture with Bing Crosby, wrote to Hong Kong.  That's exactly what it is, too.  Jesus Christ.  And I said, what's up, Bing?  He said, oh, nothing.  And we just kept on.  That's what's going on in my house.  I had this live Dean Martin album, and he says, I did a movie with Dean. 
[02:42:30]  The joke that he tells on stage, and people go like, that shit crazy.  And he goes, I did a movie with Bing Crosby.  And I said, hey, Bing, what's up?  And he said, nothing.  And the place like goes, that shit.  Like, they go crazy.  Like, for years, I'm like, what the fuck are they laughing at?  I don't get it.  And I was with Buddy Hackett once, and I said, I don't get this joke.  Maybe you can settle it for me.  He goes, wait, you don't understand.  It's Bing Crosby was a horrible, infinite man.  That's why he beat his kids. 
[02:43:00]  He couldn't get his dick hard.  So that's the whole joke, is Dean Martin goes, what's up?  And I guess what you can't see in the album is he, like, looks down at his dick.  And Bing Crosby goes, oh, nothing.  Okay.  And he goes, and we just kept on like that, just looking out the window there.  Makes a lot more sense.  What you don't know is Bing Crosby.  When's Ozzy coming in?  I can't wait to see him.  I love him.  Ozzy, uh...  About 15 minutes.  15?  Are you getting a little nervous, Jimmy?  No, I just am like, I worry that he has a hard out, and I just know this is going to be a disaster. 
[02:43:30]  What time does he have to get out?  I don't know.  Well, we'll get it.  We'll have 20 minutes with him, probably.  More than that, probably.  Jimmy, I was running yesterday along the pier in Santa Monica, and I had on War Pigs, but the studio demo of War Pigs is fucking incredible.  Is that the one with the different lyrics?  Uh, the lyrics are pretty...  It has...  Yes, one of the verses are different, but it's such like a garage job.  It's fucking incredible.  Yeah, I wonder if that's the live version from Paris. 
[02:44:00]  If it's on like a...  It's definitely not live.  No?  Um...  It's really like a basement tape.  It's amazing.  I might have heard that.  Watch me eating dead rat fingers, is that what it says?  Like, a line like that?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's like what they brought the studio, like, check out our band, right?  Why didn't they leave that in, Jimmy?  They changed the lyrics for the whole...  The entire lyrics were changed.  I don't know why.  Huh.  I don't know why.  Tommy, Omi...  Tommy made him do it. 
[02:44:30]  Oh, Tony did?  I, Omi?  No, I just made that up.  I was going to ask Ozzy that when he came in.  Did I, Omi?  He was probably going to go, no.  We'll have to ask Ozzy.  I have a quick anecdote for you, and then I'd like to go back to bed.  Okay, buddy.  When I was doing Hereafter with Clint...  I thought of you guys when this happened.  I haven't been to talk to you for a while.  When I did Hereafter with Eastwood with my big poofy hair,  there's a scene where I go up like three flights of stairs,  and this lady's supposed to hand me a letter from Matt Damon,  who plays my brother, right?  And the lady just...  All she's supposed to do is open her door, 
[02:45:00]  and I take my keys out, because it's an apartment building,  and she's supposed to go,  this is your brother.  This is from your brother.  And I'm supposed to take it, I open it, I read it,  and it's terrible news, and I just stare out into space, right?  So I woke up three flights of stairs.  I go down the hallway, and this lady, like...  We're in San Francisco shooting this movie.  This lady's like a local hire,  and she's going to get her goddamn Oscar, right?  She steps out of her apartment, closes her apartment door behind there,  and goes,  Hey, hey, Billy, um, yeah.  You're, uh, well... 
[02:45:30]  And she's, like, waving the fucking letter,  like she's Blanche DuBois, like it's too hot and all over the place.  She goes, well, uh, looks like your brother left you this.  It's your mail.  Here you go.  You're welcome.  And she hands it out to me, and I go to reach for it,  and she pulls it back a little, like to be a cunt.  And then I reach for it more,  and then finally I just snatch it out of her hand,  and then I open it, and then she goes back in.  And then without yelling cut,  Clint Eastwood just goes,  Oh, hold on a second, everybody.  And you hear him, like, going up three flights,  he's fucking 80,000 years old. 
[02:46:00]  He goes up, like, four flights of stairs,  and he just goes,  Sweetheart, honey, come on out here.  And the lady comes out, he goes,  I cannot express to you how little this movie is about you.  Holy shit.  Wow.  He takes the letter out of my hand and hands it back to her.  He goes, I mean, if I could have hired just your arm,  Christ, I would have.  He goes, now let's do it again,  and let's not make a whole big thing out of it.  It's just make-believe, for Christ's sakes. 
[02:46:30]  God.  If I could have hired just your arm,  I would have.  That is fucking funny.  It was like, you watch this lady,  like, shrinky-dink to, like, the size of a pea,  and it's, like, dead, awkward, quiet, quiet,  and it's, like, in an old apartment building,  and you hear his, like, creepy fucking steps going down,  like, creak, creak, creak, creak.  Like, it's fucking, you can't hear the fucking wheeled on the camera.  Like, you can hear nothing.  You can't hear a goddamn thing.  It's so cold and quiet, 
[02:47:00]  and, like, holy shit,  like, I've never seen him saying,  he doesn't talk,  let alone come up and blast somebody.  That is a sound thrashing.  Do you think she was embarrassed?  That was not about her.  Oh, fantastic.  And then you could hear,  all you heard was him going down three flights.  Creak, creak, creak.  Creak, creak, creak.  Like, you can't look up,  because if you look up,  you're going to make eye contact  with, like, a camera operator  and burst into laughter.  I mean, Christ, 
[02:47:30]  if I could hire just your arm,  I would.  Fucking fantastic.  Let's do it again.  And he never said cut,  so it's on Philly.  Let's do it again.  Let's not make a big deal out of it.  I'd love to see that.  Holy shit.  Make believe.  Someone's got to get that out there.  Make believe.  Yeah, we should set up  for the big Aussie thing.  Jay, you said you're going back to bed, right?  Yeah, I missed you guys.  I've been texting Ope back and forth,  like, hey, I've got to call you guys  for, like, two weeks.  So then this time I had, like,  intestinal force. 
[02:48:00]  Oh, just tell them,  I like to call you.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'm the number one.  I'm the number one star in the world.  No, that's why the terrorists hate us.  Goodbye, gentlemen.  Go hoogies.  Take it easy, Jay.  Jay Moore, everyone.  Oh, God damn, that's funny.  What a great Clint Eastwood story.  Holy shit.  Why don't we do a quick break?  When we get back,  it should be Ozzy Osbourne  and the birthday gifts next.  Stay there.  They will be an Anthony show  on the virus.  Sirius XM. 
[02:48:30]  Are you ready?  Come on, you motherfuckers.  You're sitting at a Barry Manilow concert.  Are you ready?  Me, Dad.  No.  Let me hear you make some noise.  No.  Ozzy.  No.  I do love this fucking song. 
[02:49:00]  I love the whole fucking album, actually.  Oh, I had to curse,  make myself sound cooler.  I just love the record.  That's so funny.  Entering the studio.  Ozzy, Oz.  I'm hard to get.  I've never been gotten.  Because Liam texted me.  Liam is my friend.  It's too easy today, though.  Liam said a couple minutes ago.  I wish I was that good,  but it's too easy today. 
[02:49:30]  No, but you didn't get me earlier.  I had to look,  but you just nailed me.  I smelled Ozzy in the hallway before  because he wears that great cologne.  You fucking smell him  five minutes after he walks through.  I literally bumped into him.  So I took my leak  and then I opened the bathroom door.  He was literally right there.  I got to chew gum  so I have fresh breath for Ozzy.  I see that.  You don't need an old dry mouth  when the legend is sitting next to you.  And then Kenny goes,  can I have your Perel?  I go, why?  Jimmy needs it.  He wants to be fresh.  Oh, so you don't have any germs  if you want to flip.  He's walking in. 
[02:50:00]  He wants an eight-camera shoot.  He's walking in.  I want his video documented.  Oh, I see.  Oh, there's a roll in.  There seems to be a...  It's like the Kennedy motorcade.  You always see people going by first.  First, yeah, yeah.  And then, of course...  Ladies and gentlemen, Ozzy Osbourne.  Yes.  Ozzy!  Incomparable Ozzy Osbourne.  Hi, Ozzy.  You go fucking hell, man.  I'm doing good.  How are you doing?  Good to see you.  Hi, Ozzy.  How you been?  Pretty good?  You're a busy man today.  Just see you walk around these halls.  I'm going from Baltimore  at two o'clock this morning.  I got to get up  at fucking six o'clock. 
[02:50:30]  Oh, god damn.  So you got no gig tonight.  You just...  What are you doing tonight?  Oh, fuck all.  That's it, nothing.  Hey, that is...  You're going to relax.  That's a great...  One, one.  That's a great necklace.  You're on now, yeah.  Come on, hear me.  That's a great necklace.  Turn it up, Danny, please.  One, two, one, two.  One, two.  We're good.  Turn it up, Danny, please.  I like his headphones.  I need all the fucking help  I can get.  I see.  It's about 20 or 30 of them.  Love it.  I'll collect them.  I like that.  How's the album doing, man? 
[02:51:00]  It's at number four it debuted.  Do you know what?  I don't know.  I've been on the road  for about...  I've been in Europe,  Japan, did Canada.  They've just gone back  from Canada.  It's been great.  The new band I have  is really hot, man.  Yeah, Gus is great.  It's Blasco on bass.  And who's playing drums?  Tommy Clavisus.  Yeah, the band  is fucking fantastic.  Do we know these guys  from other bands?  Well, Blasco's with Zombie.  Okay.  Tommy was with Zombie  and he was with Alice Cooper  and he was with Ted Nugent.  He's a great, great drummer. 
[02:51:30]  He really is a good drummer.  Apparently.  Gus is doing  a remarkable job as well.  The band, you know,  it's just really cool  to be around.  We have a laugh, you know.  And you're going to Brazil, too.  I saw on the website  that you got to Brazil.  I've been to Brazil  a couple of times  but I didn't go for work.  You know, I went to enjoy that.  Music is in their vines down there.  They love rhythm,  love music, you know.  I've heard that  but I spent all my time  in whorehouses.  I never did anything in Brazil  but get hookers.  Where's the...  Give me some addresses.  Oh yeah, the Rio de Janeiro 
[02:52:00]  I went a couple of times.  The first time I went there  I was at Rocking Rio  in about 1986, I think it was.  I remember the first  to Rocking Rio there.  Yeah.  It was...  I was really surprised  because I thought  it was going to be  beautiful chicks everywhere.  On the strip  and by the ocean  it was good looking chicks  but the back alleyways  were like  fucking beggars  and fucking...  Yeah, it's dangerous.  It's a dangerous, scary place.  You're either wealthy  or you're dirt poor, you know.  There's no middle...  No middle class over there, huh? 
[02:52:30]  It's just fucking  one or the other, you know.  Yeah.  And they do not like fucking...  When the police  catch somebody  doing something wrong  they fuck...  They don't give you  a second chance  to straighten, you know...  Straight bang, you know.  And they don't care  about somebody  videotaping it  and then turning it  into the press or anything.  I don't like that.  Look at what we'll do to you.  Yeah, they pose  for the camera.  Whose idea was it  because it's like  you're always...  Whoever is like  running things for you  is really a genius.  You're always in the news 
[02:53:00]  and always in...  Well, you know,  Sharon...  Sharon is great  at what she does, you know.  So I don't agree  with everything she does  all the time  but most of the time  I'll go in there  big grunting and moaning  and I'll go in there  when it wasn't that bad.  And that thing I just did  with the...  for them two guys  in Washington recently.  Oh yeah, for Colbert and Stuart.  He did something  with Cat Stevens.  That's right, I saw that.  Crazy Train  against Peace Train  on stage.  That was pretty cool.  It was okay 
[02:53:30]  but it was like  fucking nine o'clock  in the morning.  How's he like  sleeping in, man?  Fuck that, man.  Did you have to be  talked into that one?  It's not rock and roll  lifestyle.  My bohemian lifestyle  has gone out  the fucking window.  You gotta get up  early these days?  What the fuck?  Oh man, I'm not good  in the mornings.  No, you like sleeping  late, right?  I don't get into  fucking late.  Yeah, that's rock and roll.  My job's late.  Sleeping late  and waking up late.  But we're having  so much fun, man,  on this tour.  It's the best band  I've had for a long time.  Yeah.  Wow, great. 
[02:54:00]  Whose idea was it  to test your genealogy?  That was brilliant.  Well, you know,  Sharon's father  died of Alzheimer's  and her grandmother  died of Alzheimer's.  She's a fucking  obsession  about Alzheimer's.  And she wanted  to get tested.  But they said  I'll do it for free.  It's like very expensive.  I'll do it for free  if I get me.  So I went along  and then I end up  going to conventions  speaking at these places  and whatever.  But she's all right. 
[02:54:30]  I mean, I said,  what do you want to know  if you've got Alzheimer's  for you?  You'll soon know.  You can't remember  you got it anyway.  So wait,  so you went  just so she could  do it for free?  No, it's just  she wanted somebody  to, you know,  back her up  and what you've got to do.  If your wife says,  you know,  can you do that?  Well, especially you.  Yeah, Sharon.  But I mean,  my results came through first.  So I suppose you thought,  well, if he's okay,  I've got to be.  Were you surprised  what he's buddy through?  There was Neanderthal DNA 
[02:55:00]  they found.  You're a caveman.  I'm a,  what was this?  Worrying warrior.  I don't know  what the fuck that means.  Worrying warrior.  Worry warrior or something.  So when I kill somebody,  I worry that I kill  and it's like,  oh, is that it?  I'm going to leave  my knife in his back.  That would be a Jewish warrior.  You just have guilt  after you do it.  So tomorrow night,  because Ozzy's here  promoting obviously Scream  and tomorrow night  he's at the Garden, 
[02:55:30]  Wednesday night  at the Garden show.  That may even be  close to sold out.  And then Friday  at the IZOT Center  in Jersey.  And of course,  it's your birthday  and I know you've been getting it.  You probably thought  these gifts,  I have to acknowledge.  I wasn't going to do anything  but I figured  I've never given you  a birthday gift before.  So have you gotten  good stuff so far?  Oh, it's got a pile  in the other studio.  I mean,  sex feet or whatever  they call it.  Oh, like one of those  things that you fuck?  Yeah.  Yeah, that's old hat.  Believe me,  I've got one of those.  So I don't know  if you're going to like  these or not.  I might have got a look. 
[02:56:00]  I mean, look,  it's the same look  I feel like a book.  Oh, he knew immediately  what it was.  Oh, this is great.  Can't go wrong  with this gift.  It's great.  The Beatles,  it's beautiful.  Thank you very much.  Oh, you're welcome.  I hope you like Beatles books.  All right.  He's not done.  No, I'm not done.  Number Two.  There goes One Away.  That's the...  Do you have this one already?  No.  Okay, because I have  a gift receipt  if you want to...  So far, so good. 
[02:56:30]  Jimmy's so nervous.  Well, I wanted to...  You know,  you're getting Ozzy a gift.  It's like,  what are you getting?  Oh, this is great.  Fantastic.  Two John Lennon books.  Wow.  Any...  Have you seen that film?  No, Airboy.  No.  I hear it's great.  Very, very good.  Okay, and this is...  I feel...  Tell Tony Dennis I'm sorry  because he probably has  to carry the shit.  We weigh...  It's 18 pounds of stuff.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I'll have this.  Okay, you have that one.  You got the 10-year-old book.  Well, I didn't know  it was 10 years old.  No, I'll tell you what.  It's still a good gift.  Thank you very much. 
[02:57:00]  Oh, you're welcome.  But I didn't know  you had it already.  I can always bring it back.  You know, I just...  Just re-wrap it, Ozzy.  That would be great  if you just re-gifted  all this stuff  to people in the building.  So I had to see it.  I think the birthday gifts  were a success.  They went a little better  than I thought of it.  Damn cameras are  fucking unbelievable.  I love the flip.  Yeah, the flip.  The battery life is terrible.  You know, I got that one  on my...  I got an iPhone recently.  Yeah, iPhones are great, right?  I'm fucking filming myself.  I'm like,  this is a cool phone.  It's a picture of me. 
[02:57:30]  I've just took a body  off of myself.  Do you turn it around?  You can actually turn it around  and just hold it.  It's unbelievable,  this stuff now, isn't it?  Do you get good reception?  What, in my television?  No, with the iPhone.  We have fucking  a nightmare trying here.  Oh, I'm fucking used to...  I'll dial a number on you  and put it to the side of my head  and somebody else will pick up...  I keep fucking...  That's not the phone, Ozzy.  Maybe you just dial in  the wrong number.  Oh, the list, like...  Sharon, press that.  Then they go with  the blue thing coming.  Put it to the side of my head 
[02:58:00]  and fucking Bill Ward  and he'll pick up the phone.  I'll pick up the phone.  Did you get anything else  for your birthday?  What else did you get?  What's a good gift for you?  I just got in fucking town.  You're right.  I didn't mean to upset you.  I got that.  Jimmy gets so nervous.  I love him.  But what's something  that Sharon and the kids  would get you  that you really want?  Look at me.  Just jewelry?  She got me that.  She got me that.  She got me that.  She got me that.  I think you got some  cool fucking jewelry, man.  Yeah, you got some good shit, man. 
[02:58:30]  Gold and diamonds and shit.  That's nice.  The guy's rock and roller.  Do you get sick and tired  of going on the road?  I mean, I get a little tired.  No, I'm having  the best time right now.  You sound really...  The voice has held up  extremely well.  Do you think that's probably  because the healthier lifestyle  is there?  I mean, it's all right  until there's a bug  that goes around the crew.  Then you keep passing it  backwards and forwards,  you know.  That gets on my fucking head.  When I get sick...  When I can't perform,  I get miserable then.  But I'm having some  real good gigs.  Yeah, I was reading 
[02:59:00]  some of the press  from Canada  and it was very good.  They said the energy's amazing,  the shows have been great.  Do you read...  Do you read...  No.  No, you don't.  If I read one,  it's always the one  that says something  that pisses me off.  So I'd rather not read it.  Stay away from it.  I mean, because  that wouldn't be  core critics  if they didn't criticize.  Yeah.  I mean, very rarely  are they going to say  something just positive  without throwing  some kind of a jam.  He did too many  new songs.  He didn't do enough  new songs. 
[02:59:30]  He can never please all.  How's the documentary?  I know Jack is  doing the documentary.  Well, rumor has it  it's finished now.  I've seen a copy  of it, actually.  It's very good.  Yeah.  He's done some  really serious  searching  and getting local news  and all this  from back in the day.  The last time...  Wait, what's the documentary about?  I don't know what it's called.  He changed the title of it.  What's it called?  It's about you.  I don't know.  I don't know what the fuck  it's called.  No, I was confused  because you said  I think it's done. 
[03:00:00]  Well, the other week  he goes to me  I've finished the documentary  and I go, great.  But can you just do me  one more interview?  I said, you told me  you've finished this.  Just for safety.  A little safety.  You said that McCartney  he got McCartney to do it?  Yeah, I was fucking  flawed and armed.  Did you see the footage?  Jack comes in one day  and he goes, Dad,  is there anybody  you think  would you like me to?  interview for?  I don't know.  I can't think.  He said, what about  one of the Beatles?  I said, none of them 
[03:00:30]  want to talk about me.  He says, well,  Paul McCartney.  I go, fuck,  he wouldn't bother  about me.  He goes,  start with Ringo.  I've already done it  with him.  I'm like, what?  It's really good.  Oh, you like the footage?  It's fucking awesome.  Was it weird watching him  actually speak about you?  I was like fucking  in shock.  That would be like Jimmy  watching Ozzy talk about him.  Him and the other guys  were the reason  why I wanted to get  involved in music  in the first place.  I mean,  they were my heroes. 
[03:01:00]  Do you think,  I know you never,  I recently was,  you never got to meet  Harrison or Lennon,  but even Lennon  who was,  you know,  until 1980,  you were pretty famous  by then.  I mean,  so I don't know  who you were.  It's like,  whatever you look up to  when you were young,  no matter what,  you know,  it's the fucking Archies,  you know,  whatever you look up to  and whatever you embody  your dreams in.  Yeah.  And it's kind of,  sometimes I'm like,  oh,  I'm disappointed.  And sometimes when I meet 
[03:01:30]  these people,  I go,  you know,  it's better than I expected.  It's always a gamble for me.  I'd rather stay my distance.  I'm not one of these guys  that runs up and goes,  I'm,  you know,  John Lennon or whatever.  I wouldn't know  what you say to them.  Well,  yeah,  I would love to agree with you,  but I am one of those guys.  I'll just run up  and usually I'll say  something stupid  like,  hi,  you,  and they walk away.  I annoy them.  But sometimes you,  I'm a bit like,  I said the wrong fucking thing  all the time.  She only goes,  you dick.  When you met McCartney,  I know you.  I mean,  I was,  when I met him, 
[03:02:00]  I met him at these studios.  Yeah,  yeah,  over at Howard Show.  I mean,  I was freaked out.  I mean,  Tony,  my assistant comes in  and he goes,  look,  I phoned up from the Howard Stern show  and for,  you'd switch plays  with someone and I go,  you know what?  Fuck that.  I'm not going to,  my time is whatever,  so I'm not going to switch  for anybody.  He goes,  but let me tell you,  Tony,  forget it.  I'm not changing.  He goes,  let me tell you.  What was he?  McCartney has these times.  So you went first or second?  I can't remember.  I think it was first, 
[03:02:30]  but it was like,  I was like,  I'm freaked out.  Did you walk in  and did you just talk to him  or did you go like,  hey,  look,  could you introduce me?  He's a,  I mean,  he's such an irregular guy.  I mean,  you think,  I mean,  I don't know.  I was,  I don't know.  Now I kind of understand  people who admire what I do,  you know.  People,  when they come and see me  and they go,  they start crying  and I'm like,  I'm not fucking ugly.  I'm not.  I've had one guy  cry.  A guy?  When he met me.  Yeah,  only one. 
[03:03:00]  A lot of women after dates,  but I mean,  only one guy  and it was really awkward.  It was outside of a gig  and he just started weeping.  The other night  I was in Toronto,  right?  That's weird.  And,  uh,  somebody comes up to me  and goes,  you're going to laugh now.  Gordon Lightfoot.  I go,  where the fuck's Gordon  fucking Lightfoot?  I've heard the name,  I'm thinking,  what's he doing here?  Jazz goes,  I don't know,  I don't really know what he's doing.  Anyway,  he comes in with his daughter  and she's like,  oh,  fuck, 
[03:03:30]  you know.  She was crying?  Crying.  Maybe because her father's  Gordon Lightfoot.  I know,  she was looking at Kelly  like he's so lucky.  But what is he,  what was his claim to fame?  Gordon Lightfoot.  Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald.  Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald.  He had a rock.  It's a folk.  What was his other song?  He had another big song.  He had a few,  man.  Edmund Fitzgerald.  He's got to be 97.  He's old.  He still looks okay.  We're an older guy. 
[03:04:00]  Creeping round my mind.  Is that the creeping round out there?  I don't know.  I'm saying Gordon Lightfoot.  It's really uncomfortable  for everybody involved.  Sundown he did.  You might know Sundown.  I don't fucking know.  Sundown is a same looking eye  I'm eating to me.  So his daughter just started crying.  What do you say when somebody is,  I was very uncomfortable  because the guy was like.  And you get the people  that come to the start  and they're as quiet as in  and they scream  and they get,  whoa, what the fuck's going on?  Yeah, relax.  What the fuck is staring me?  Because people want to have a moment 
[03:04:30]  that you remember them by.  They want to have a special moment.  It's really weird  being on the other side of the fence.  When you talk about McCartney,  I was that kid, you know.  Yeah.  I mean,  you go,  what did I say to him about it?  But he's very,  McCartney was a gentleman with me.  Really nice man, you know.  Well, you're always,  it's funny, Ozzy,  I was telling somebody yesterday,  you,  after interacting with you,  it's like,  it makes me much,  always nicer to fans  because you remember  these interactions 
[03:05:00]  and Ozzy's always been sweet.  He's never a dick to fans.  It's like,  well, who the fuck would I be?  Are you equating yourself  to Ozzy Osbourne?  Not really, no.  But I mean,  just kind of,  I actually answered that seriously.  What a fucking,  you should smash,  we should find that book  outside with Escalade Tire Tracks in it.  You really should  just leave it outside.  I'm a fool.  But you want to have that moment  that the performer remembers you by  and then people tend to overdo it.  Yeah, but you know what?  It's like,  without these kids,  I ain't got to,  I wouldn't be here now.  I mean,  I was just talking to some guy about, 
[03:05:30]  you know,  when Axl Rose,  he still keeps them fucking waiting  for three days and all that.  Oh, shit.  I'm like,  get a fucking life, man.  Either shit or get off the park,  you know?  You would have thought  he would have figured it out by now.  Yeah, but you know what?  He's still doing the same shit.  That's fucking,  that's not fair.  Of course not.  Because these kids  have jobs in fucking pizza  and they save the pennies  to buy you a ticket.  At least be,  it's disrespectful, I think.  I mean,  no matter how fucked I've been in the past,  or whatever I've been on,  I've always made that stage on time. 
[03:06:00]  You've always fallen down  on that stage on time.  I mean, yeah,  but at least I fell down  on the fucking stage.  It's been a long time.  Right when they announced.  God damn it,  you were coming out.  It is amazing  how many performers,  and I'm sure not just actors,  are just fucking spoiled  and they have no regard  for the fact  people are waiting for them.  I mean,  I was talking to a guy,  one of the guys from Chicago,  one of the trumpet players  at one time,  and he says,  you know,  he's only been up there  in a 405 three-way now,  and he says,  I'll get up in the morning  and look out the window  and there's traffic 
[03:06:30]  bumper to bumper,  and he says,  thank God I'm not  in one of them cars.  Going to a job  which I hate,  someone I hate,  going back for the TV dinner,  marry,  bang the wife,  and go to sleep  once every blue moon.  You know,  I mean,  that's when you,  when you look at something  like that and you go,  I'm fucking luckiest man  in the world.  Yeah,  absolutely.  I'm lucky,  I'm a lucky guy,  man.  Yeah,  I mean,  it's like when you start,  especially when you start  meeting people who you admire  and you idolize  and they know you,  and it's just like,  wow,  man,  life is really good. 
[03:07:00]  I have no fucking reason  to complain.  I mean,  every day is a good day,  you know,  I mean,  you know,  it's great right now,  life.  You're writing too.  It's like,  you're not just,  it's almost like you're  New York Times bestselling author.  You run a Grammy,  an Emmy,  and now you have  like a medical column.  It's like,  you're like a real gentleman.  I don't know about gentleman,  but I'm a medical column.  The word gently  doesn't apply to me.  You gave great advice though.  There's a,  it was,  I think.  Yeah,  but you know,  there was one, 
[03:07:30]  there was one,  there was one,  there was one,  the other,  what was the one?  Every time I go to a  Chinese restaurant,  I don't know what the  fucking Chinese were.  I'll get,  I'll get an erection.  What's your advice?  Just masturbate.  Do you take any of the,  I'm not gonna,  I like the dick pills.  I really do.  I love Cialis.  Viagra gives me a headache,  but Cialis stays in  for a couple of days  and it works really well.  I don't get a fucking chance  to use it.  Oh,  line baby,  the fucking boner 
[03:08:00]  on my own.  I've run out of pornography now.  Do you like pornography?  I'm a fan.  That's why your hair is so long.  I can't do,  I'll just explain  why I have short hair.  He rubbed his own head  and made the jerky off motion.  Yes, you're rubbing  your hair off.  That is actually pretty close  to what I do,  except it's nipple tweaking.  If you,  if you think me giving you  Beatles,  I'm just,  why?  He should know.  He likes to tweak  his own nipples  while he's having sex,  Ozzy.  Yeah, exactly.  That's not the conversation.  Get a fucking hooker. 
[03:08:30]  Well,  you're talking to the hooker kid.  I've spent a lot of money on them.  I don't know how,  like,  especially,  it's amazing to me  to be in a long-term relationship  and be married.  I don't know how  anybody does that  in the public eye  with fear.  Is that what it is?  No.  Do you still,  you know what?  It's like,  it's like,  it's,  it's,  it's,  it's,  it's,  temptation is always there.  But you go,  if I,  what if I jump on that one  and I will lose the one I have  and the one I jump on 
[03:09:00]  is worse than the fucking situation  or more than it is bad.  I mean,  it must be a common thread  for people to want,  you know,  I'm pissed off of being with me  this one.  I want to go,  but you just get on with it,  you know?  I mean,  obviously you're dedicated  to your wife and everything,  but do you go out there at night  and during the shows  and look and go like,  God,  what I love.  Oh,  it looks like I'm fucking blind.  I'm not Ray Charles.  exactly.  I mean,  why is there a pair of good pair  of jugs in the audience?  I'm fucking lucky,  man.  That was a stupid question. 
[03:09:30]  Of course you do.  I mean,  do you think I've got no balls?  Exactly.  I apologize.  I'm not a 62,  but I've got a little dick left.  Exactly.  He doesn't look at girls anymore,  Ant.  He just,  it's a matter of you.  I look at guys.  How dare you?  Yeah.  I am an idiot  and I apologize.  And a part of me,  you know,  I'm not going to lie,  a part of me,  but I'm insulted.  My fans are getting  the wrong idea about me.  He doesn't look at girls' tits,  he looks at the guys.  Oh, yeah.  I was a little hurt,  actually,  when I looked at guys,  he kind of waved to Danny.  I was like,  what the fuck?  I'm right here. 
[03:10:00]  Yeah,  I guess you never,  you never get sick of looking,  but my thing,  I'm so weak.  I'm a very weak person  and I always act.  I don't know how to say,  I just don't know how to do it.  I don't know how to do it.  So do what?  Like,  I don't drink and drug,  that I can do,  but I don't know how to not act out sexually.  It's very difficult.  You don't be a guy,  that's why.  I mean,  I mean,  when people go,  oh,  it doesn't bother me,  you've got something fucking wrong with you.  If you see a hot-looking chick,  and to you,  it's hot,  no matter what, 
[03:10:30]  to anybody else it looks like,  and you don't go,  fucking hell,  I don't know what's happening like in there.  That's what,  if you think it,  it's just as good as saying it.  If you're thinking it inside,  it's still going on.  You still get caught looking?  I got caught looking at my girlfriend  having a serious discussion  and she's like,  could you not look at that girl's ass  while I'm having this conversation?  It was like one of those,  I'm not feeling like a love connection type.  You were at your mom's house?  I guess I fuck my mom now,  don't I,  he's gay and I like my mom.  What the fuck's the matter with him? 
[03:11:00]  It's blowing.  What are you doing,  oh Jimmy?  I am,  it's just hysterical.  When you get,  when you get caught looking,  is it like,  do you deny it,  or are you at a point,  like when you're married,  where you're like,  ah.  That's why I wear the dark sunglasses.  That helps,  that helps the dark glasses.  But sometimes,  it's like,  I do the sweeping,  so I get caught doing the sweeping,  you go like,  when you get caught,  it's like,  yeah,  you fucking saw your ass,  you know what you're doing.  Mind you though, 
[03:11:30]  it takes two to,  you know,  I get like,  well,  wasn't Tiger Woods wrong for doing that,  wasn't this guy,  but you know,  there's a chick that he goes,  there's a partner,  all men are promiscuous,  and I go to Sharon,  well,  promiscuous,  with who?  Yeah.  With a woman,  or you know,  it takes two to,  it's always the,  us guys.  But it's tough to win an argument with the wife,  when you're defending Tiger Woods,  like believe me,  I went through that,  I made the mistake when Tiger was on,  I looked at my girlfriend, 
[03:12:00]  I'm like,  I understand,  why he would do that,  and you can't explain that to a chick,  how you understand.  Yeah,  but the thing is,  they think the poor chicks,  eeks.  Yeah.  I mean,  I mean,  it cost him a fucking few,  a few bucks.  A few bucks.  Fuck the river.  A hundred million dollars he gave his wife.  He's never even going to notice it gone.  I mean,  it still hurts.  Yeah,  but a hundred million dollars for a fucking piece of ass.  Yeah,  that's crazy.  You could buy a fucking village for that somewhere.  I know,  and get a lot of ass from the villagers.  Sharon said on her talk show the other day,  that you guys still have sex five times a week. 
[03:12:30]  Is that true,  Ozzy?  In her head,  but I'm never there.  I'm never there,  I'm fucking,  I don't know what time,  is it going to be like,  oh!  Yeah,  she said that the other day.  Five times a week.  Well,  do you know what I want in that column?  I was reading one of the things of the day,  and he goes,  Dear Dr. Ozzy,  I used to have sex with my wife,  five,  seven days a week.  I'm a bit worried now,  we only have five.  I'm 65,  and I go, 
[03:13:00]  I just went,  stop complaining.  Really?  You're on the road so much,  what do you do when you're off to just relax?  What do you like doing just to hang out?  I like to do fuck all,  but watch telly.  Really?  And I've got this new thing on my laptop now,  it's a Slimbox or something.  Oh,  yes.  It's fucking brilliant,  man.  What are you watching?  What are you watching?  You know,  it's my channels that I have at home,  you know,  no matter what.  You can watch anything,  anywhere,  yeah.  It's fucking great, 
[03:13:30]  man.  It's through a computer,  right?  Like,  if you're on the road.  Yeah.  That's about the only thing I can do.  He's watching his shit.  What kind of shows,  what shows are you into these days?  What are you watching?  Um,  you know,  I watch a lot of stuff.  Document,  military channel,  history channel,  document,  isn't that the best?  I could sit there all day  and watch like the marathon  of World War II  or something.  It's fantastic.  Just sit there and watch.  Do you know,  I was watching that,  uh,  uh,  uh,  uh,  uh,  ID channel.  What's it called?  Yeah,  yeah.  Discovery ID.  Yes.  And it's all about fucking, 
[03:14:00]  I'm watching this,  it's about murderers  and women murderers  and fucking,  yeah,  yeah.  I'm going,  I'm suddenly going,  I'm fucking depressed.  I want to be watching this,  I think we're fucking  three days solid.  I wonder why I'm depressed.  I'll put something like that.  You're just watching murder shows.  I watch those too  and,  and it's always the same thing.  These women don't learn anything.  You don't buy the life insurance policy  a month before.  I know.  There was one the other day  and she just  butchered her grandparents  with her 27 times 
[03:14:30]  found dead stabbed to death.  I'm going,  well,  they didn't have to go  to find it.  She was at the fucking bed  covered in clarity.  They really don't learn.  They should watch the show  and see what doesn't work.  I know,  but you know,  the amount of people  that use arsenic,  it's fucking crazy.  Yeah,  yeah,  and it builds up  in their system slowly.  And all her family  are uncles,  are fucking aunts.  I thought,  she's got the plague  going through her.  I don't even know  the wrong family.  And she was the one  that didn't die 
[03:15:00]  and I went,  I wonder why she,  and she was nursing him.  She's feeding him  the fucking gay,  you know.  Yeah,  and they almost,  they almost get away with it  and then they fuck up one time.  Yeah,  they do something,  they give themselves away,  like at the funeral  they go,  yippee!  And I'm like,  that's a bad sign.  That's singing.  How about Hoarders?  Sharon said,  she was in it one time  and she said,  you guys watch,  you like Hoarders.  Do you watch them?  We're obsessed with Hoarders.  I mean,  that's amazing  that people can live  with all that shit.  It is amazing.  Literally,  all that shit,  cat shit. 
[03:15:30]  I mean,  there was one I was watching  and I found like  three dead cats  flattened under the fucking bubble.  I'm like,  what the fuck's wrong with people?  And the one guy,  his toilet was so full of shit.  Nobody had to pay this guy  all their salary  to get a look.  I'm like,  fuck that, man.  Is that the one  where they were throwing bags,  they were shitting into a bag  and throwing it up on the steps?  They were saving their shit.  I thought I was a collector.  They were saving their shit.  Blocking the stairs.  That is beyond me. 
[03:16:00]  And we actually have  one of the shrinks  that do the show  come in here  and we're asking her,  why are they so nice?  When they walk in,  they're like,  hi,  how are you?  Oh,  let's look at the room  and see,  you know,  and it's a pile of shit.  You'd think they'd come in  and then they get all pissed off  and they go,  we've got to get rid  of these bottles  and we've got to get rid  of these crates  of fucking empty bottles  and whatever.  And they're like,  I want you to keep that.  I've looked at that  every morning  for the last 15 years.  It's shit.  It's nothing.  Throw it away,  you frigging lunatic. 
[03:16:30]  Watch out,  get a new,  at least replace it  with a fresh piece of shit.  I love that Ozzy watches  a lot of television.  Ozzy knows,  he knows.  Because that's exactly  what I like to do  when I'm just doing nothing  is just sit and watch  a lot of television.  I'm just a couch fucking,  what is it?  Couch potato.  Yeah,  I love that.  Do you save stuff though?  Like,  are you a colleague?  I collect stuff.  I mean,  if he wasn't,  I would be a bit of a whore  to be honest with you  because my father  is just having to go,  oh,  I'll save that.  It'll come in handy.  It's dog shit. 
[03:17:00]  Personalizer.  You're not going to use that.  Yeah,  I think if it wasn't  for people that actually  took care of me,  employees as it were,  my house would be a wreck  all the time.  I mean,  men ain't,  they ain't there by,  but Shannon will come  into my hotel room  and fucking vacuum  the floor,  you know.  Really?  I've got fucking  grappas and crumbs  and fucking crusts  and bread and everything.  Bits of half-eaten sandwiches.  And she'll go,  oh,  do you have to do it?  And she's fucking  vacuuming the floor.  We're in a fucking hotel. 
[03:17:30]  Five grand a night,  what the fuck  is wrong with that?  Room service  and the maids  and things,  you know.  That's what we get  in a hotel for.  What the fuck?  So that's like  the balance.  She's kind of like,  she'll keep things,  you know.  Oh yeah,  she'll,  you go to a restaurant,  she fucking takes  the empty,  dirty place  in the kitchen  and washes them.  She's fucking unbelievable.  Do you have,  do you have any memorabilia  you've collected  like from,  like whether it's musicians,  do you have any stuff  that you love  that you collect  like any Beatles stuff  or?  Uh,  I've got,  I've got,  18 pounds of books. 
[03:18:00]  The last concert  I did in San Francisco  on a ticket  in one of these frames.  I was going to get that  but I didn't think of it.  That's a great,  do you have anything  signed by them?  Yeah,  I've got some,  I've got pictures  signed by Lennon.  Wow, wow.  There was a story  with McCartney,  he's,  he's a monitor guy,  wasn't the same guy  that I used  and,  I'm watching a TV one day  and an advert comes out  and I go, 
[03:18:30]  that's a fucking great song  where I didn't know  who it was.  I was going to,  I was going to  nick the song  and change it around.  So I go,  I'll go to this guy  and I'll get me  the McCartney album,  he got me the McCartney  and I'll put the McCartney  and it was called  Fine Line  off of one of these albums  and I'm fucking,  I'm embarrassed  because I've done  his fucking song  and then he sent me  a letter.  He said,  thanks for not  nicking my song.  Okay.  Hey,  by the way, 
[03:19:00]  great job on,  I loved your version  of Howe.  You covered Lennon's Howe  for Amnesty International  and it's like  you're walking through,  through the city  and you're holding flowers  and at the end  you just kind of  put them down  on Strawberry Fields.  Really nice.  But the people are going,  who is that when  you're trying to film  in Manhattan  and you're fucking nuts?  I bet, right?  Did you know it was Ozzy?  Oh yeah,  I had to know.  I'd like to fucking  like Pied Piper  fall in the morning.  It must be rough  to just walk around  Manhattan.  You know what Sharon says? 
[03:19:30]  The day they stop  recognizing me,  I've got a fucking problem.  Yeah, yeah.  And we only have  like a minute left  with Ozzy.  Just let's get,  we want to scream.  All right, you take it, Jim.  The album is,  and I'm a fan  so the album is  fucking fantastic.  The live show,  I've seen it already  at OzFest  and I saw it last year.  I'm going again  tomorrow night.  You're going to the garden, right?  Of course I'm going.  Ozzy at Madison Square Garden  in December.  You have to go to this.  And then if you want  to be with Ozzy  on his birthday,  the third,  he's at the IZOD Center.  Wow.  Can you believe it? 
[03:20:00]  I'm working on my birthday.  I couldn't,  it's the best birthday gift  of the lot.  He's doing it again.  You've got to fire some people.  You shouldn't work  on your birthday.  Oh, I'm fucking fired.  Get them to save me.  I said I should fire myself.  Shouldn't I?  Yeah, just retire.  Take a day for your birthday.  You'll never retire.  Nah.  Nah.  How mad is Tony going to be  that I got you 18,  that's 18 pounds  we weighed that.  18 pounds.  Arnold Schwarzenberg  is going to get  the fucking hotel.  You can leave them here  if you want.  You don't have to be polite.  Oh, Jimmy.  My girlfriend was  so fucking annoyed at me.  I was going to sign  one of the books to you  and then she goes,  you don't sign it to him, 
[03:20:30]  you asshole.  She's like,  it's about the book.  Don't make it about you.  No, it's girlfriend you have.  Oh, no, but she's right, though.  I am an asshole.  Believe me,  if it wasn't for her,  I would have put bows  and balloons on them  and made a homo out of myself.  I do have a little card  for Ozzy, though.  I almost forgot.  Oh, do you?  I got the little Barnes  and Noble card  with your, uh,  with your, uh...  Oh, it's not bad.  No, it's bad.  It's not bad.  Ozzy, the Beatles  were great.  Second only to...  Oh, you're so homo, too.  Oh, second only.  You're so homo.  What does it don't say? 
[03:21:00]  I said, Ozzy,  the Beatles are great.  Second only to you.  Happy birthday, Jim Norton.  I just put Jim.  And he called me homo sweet.  And he's right.  He is.  Well, what can we say?  Ozzy Osbourne,  you're my favorite person ever.  I was, uh,  I'm happy you're here  and you're healthy  and I can't wait to see you  tomorrow night at the Garden.  All right.  I'll try and put a good show  in for now.  If I get to fucking bed  early enough tonight.  Yeah, it's always a good show.  It's always a fucking great show.  So I guess, uh,  can I say we have to get Ozzy out?  Nice seeing you guys. 
[03:21:30]  Ozzy, we love you, bro.  Thank you, Ozzy.  We love you.  All right.  I guess we're done too, right?  We'll see you guys tomorrow.  Of course we are.  I'll try to get it for you.  Oh, well, you know,  I could just, you know, leave.  Or I could talk about  how shaving is such a drag, Opie.  Yeah, is it?  It really is.  It could be a drag, literally.  You know, where it drags on your skin.  Uh-huh.  But it makes other things in life possible,  like a job or a significant other.  Or meeting famous people like Ozzy Osbourne. 
[03:22:00]  Good thing there's the new fully loaded  Panasonic Multiflex Shaver, Opie.  It's the only four-blade electric  with ultra-sharp nanotech blades.  Uh-huh.

[03:23:00]  men's shaver.  They're chatting right now.  It's, uh...  What they're doing is  Ozzy and Jimmy are chatting.  You can hear them in the background, can't you?  I think Ozzy just signed the photo  that was oh so very important to Jimmy.  Look at that Wendy Wave's tits.  Our photo.  Actually, it was a poster.  Oh, they're, uh...  Yeah, they're, uh...  Yeah, they're, uh...  Oh, they're, uh...  They're actually...  They literally...  Hi, Ozzy!  Thank you.  They literally had to grab  and pull Ozzy away  from Jimmy Norton, by the way. 
[03:23:30]  His people had to come in  and bodily  drag Ozzy away from Jimmy.  More importantly...  Oh, Jimmy.  Oh, now Jimmy's running.  One more thing.  Hey, Jerry...  More importantly...  Yeah, yeah.  More importantly...  More importantly...  Oh, no!  Oh, no!  Oh, no!  Oh, the...  The pile of...  All right.  Perfect.  There it is, ladies and gentlemen.  The pile of books...  That's what he thinks  in your stupid home. 
[03:24:00]  Oh, no!  The pile of books  are laying on the counter.  Everyone's gone.  Oh, no!  That is the saddest thing  I've ever seen!  All four of them!  Oh, no!  Oh, I feel so...  I feel so bad.  He might be out in the hall.  That's so horrible.  No, Ozzy, out in the hall.  Oh, no! 
[03:24:30]  The big...  Oh, Jimmy.  I'm gonna cry.  I swear to God.  I've said some rank shit  on this show.  I've said things  that I should feel like  garbage for.  But I feel so sad  and bad right now.  I do.  All your...  Because you went out,  you went to the store,  you bought those,  you thought about it.  They're all just now  sitting here on the console. 
[03:25:00]  He didn't give it  a second thought  to take those.  I have to be honest.  It is exactly  as it should be.  But he was very cool.  We were talking after  about me doing sets at night  and they actually  physically just dragged him out.  Yes, they did.  But he was like,  you're doing comedy.  Like I told him,  I do comedy at night.  And...  He asked for the books.  No, he didn't.  Oh, Roland!  Oh, what a prick!  Roland goes,  he asked for the books.  I'm like, no, he didn't.  He goes, I know. 
[03:25:30]  And he ducked back out.  But the no, he didn't  was almost a hopeful...  Of course it was!  Yes, it was.  And then Roland just goes,  no, he didn't.  Oh, shit!  Roland is a cruel bastard.  I will never laugh  harder than I just did.  That was...  Oh, it's the saddest,  funniest thing.  That is absolute  tragedy comedy mask.  Yeah.  That is the definition  of tragedy comedy.  I filmed right after 
[03:26:00]  the interview.  He didn't even give it  a glance after the interview.  No, of course not!  People are asking,  Jimmy, did you save  the receipt?  He touched them, though,  Jimmy.  Now you need to keep those.  No, he...  It's humiliating.  Oh!  Oh, the card!  Oh, no!  Not the card!  My card!  The card!  Holy shit!  The card!  The card is still there!  The card is still there!  He didn't even take the card  that he could have easily  just put in his pocket.  No!  The card is as big 
[03:26:30]  as a credit card.  He could have easily  taken that.  This is the saddest thing  I've ever seen in my life.  He just was busy.  Oh, no, this is sad.  I'm so sad.  I can't take this.  But he was just busy.  That's okay.  I can't take it.  He was very busy.  Oh, my God, Jimmy.  But he was just busy.  That's what I understand.  He was very busy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They dragged him out.  Whatever gets you  to sleep at night.  Oh, I know.  It's horrendous.  Oh, my God, the card!  Oh, I wish I would have remembered  I would have yelled,  Ozzy, you forgot your books.  No, I didn't. 
[03:27:00]  Ozzy actually picked  the books up to leave.  This is the truth.  He picked the books up  and I said to him,  no, no, just leave him.  We'll have Tony.  I actually told him  to put them back down  and get Tony to give them.  I was so stupid.  Yeah.  I'm running home with this footage.  How much of that did we film?  Can I have all that footage, though?  I'm running home  with that footage.  Oh, my dear sweet Lord.  Do you have the animals  talking to him?  Because you started  the live read  and I noticed Ozzy got up  and I'm like,  wait a minute,  he's not really  looking at those books anymore.  Oh, my God.  We had a nice chat, though.  I filmed the whole fucking thing  and then you guys were talking 
[03:27:30]  about Wendy Williams' tits,  I heard.  Yeah, he goes,  who's she?  I'll take that over him  taking the books.  I had a nice chat with him after  and they had to actually  come in and physically get him  because he had to leave.  It hurts.  I laugh so hard.  Yeah, it hurts me  for other reasons.  That will be the biggest laugh  I ever have.  I don't know how  I get better than that.  All of a sudden,  the books are just piled up  all sadly on this.  I heard Opie just start  laughing his ass off  and he's got his camera  and he's zooming in  and I'm like,  what's he doing?  And then I saw  the pile of books  and Ozzy long gone 
[03:28:00]  and his people long gone  and it was like,  he's not even in the building.  It's the saddest thing.  None of his people  are in the building.  No, they have another thing.  They had a heart out  of 10-10.  He was going to do  my Boneyard show  but this was going so great  I said I wasn't going  to stop this for that.  He was having  a fucking great time.  He was.  Well, you should take this  footage from our show  and put it on  your Boneyard show.  Yeah, I was...  People are suggesting 
[03:28:30]  maybe a mixtape  of Love Songs next time.  Let's all just suggest  things that Ozzy can leave.  And there's the pile  of books.  And there's the pile  of books.  But you know what?  This is called  trying to make yourself  feel better.  I did get his fucking mug.  I wish he would try  to get that fucking mug back.  Oh, wow.  Somebody left his  fucking soda mug here.  Someone gave that  to him here though.  I don't care.  He was drinking out of it.  It's now my fucking mug.  Me and Ozzy  having coffee together. 
[03:29:00]  We won't be reading  Beatles books.  And then here's Whitey  saying,  Ozzy left the books.  La la la la.  La la la la.  Jimmy hurt his back  carried.  La la la la.  18 pounds of a la la la la.  That's what you get,  you and sha la la la.  Took a sweet card.  La la la la.  Left that too.  La la la.  He did say it was  homo sweet.  Yeah, it was homo sweet.  But honestly,  what would Ozzy  have done with the card  anyway?  Exactly.  He read it. 
[03:29:30]  He got a good laugh  out of it.  It was fun.  I think he had  a very good time today.  He did.  You couldn't write  a better ending  to the whole  fucking birthday saga.  Here's another one.  Ozzy's in his limo  laughing his ass off  right now going,  did you see those  bloody books?  What a tool.  What a wanker.  Oh, no.  Look at how fat I am.  Oh, wow.  Thanks, Dan.  You got some great  pictures of me and Ozzy.  I just took as many.  Dude, you got me and Ozzy  talking a lot.  Oh, these are wonderful.  Oh, good.  You took very candid 
[03:30:00]  shots of them talking.  That's cool.  I didn't stop  the entire time.  Every one of those  will be blown up  to fucking billboard size  and signed.  But it was...  Oh, no.  I love books  just sitting there.  Oh, my God.  We got to get  the fuck out of here.  I think he had  a great time, though.  He loves us.  He was fucking  really enjoying himself.  He relaxes in here.  You can tell.  Yeah.  I made him laugh.  I was very happy  about making him laugh.  He's awesome.  He looks great.  He looks great.  He sounds great.  He does.  He doesn't mumble as much. 
[03:30:30]  He's always been a mumbler.  Let's be honest with each other.  He's always been a mumbler,  but I think it's  because he's healthier now.  But you could understand  him a lot more.  Yeah, he's a lot healthier.  The first couple times  we talked about him.  He's definitely a lot healthier.  You could tell.  He looks good.  He's spry, as they say.  He's got a great sense of humor.  Oh, he's the fucking best.  Holy shit.  He certainly does have a good sense of humor.  And he might leave Majors' picture.  I have a file for you.  You do have it?  Yeah.  Oh.  I do.  All right, guys.  See you tomorrow.  Yeah, bye.  Later, man.  The Opie and Anthony Show.
