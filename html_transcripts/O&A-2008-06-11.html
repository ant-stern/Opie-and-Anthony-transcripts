<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts boasting about their top ranking with male listeners while acknowledging their significantly lower rating among female listeners. Opie detailed an acupuncture experience before the conversation shifted to the previous night's severe thunderstorm in New York City.  Opie and Jimmy recounted their individual experiences with power outages and high winds, contrasting the city's reaction to the storm with Dallas's over-the-top response to snow.

The show then transitioned to a discussion of the Don Rickles documentary, "Mr. Warmth," praising Rickles's offensive humor and comparing his ability to get away with it to the stricter standards faced by modern comedians. They expressed a desire to have Rickles on the show. This led to a discussion of Paul McCartney’s music, including a mocking of a nonsensical song clip, and a broader critique of the Beatles, Yoko Ono, and her contribution to John Lennon's later work.  A clip from "Rock and Roll Circus" featuring Yoko Ono's performance was played and heavily criticized.  A caller from Dallas was ridiculed for complaining about the storm. The NBA playoffs, specifically the Lakers/Celtics series and referee bias, were briefly discussed, followed by more listener calls. Opie mentioned losing his straw fedora in the wind.  A video of a woman in minimal clothing doing Wii Fit became a significant point of discussion.  A call from Brother Anthony (Jill Nicolini’s brother) checked in on his sister’s relationship with Anthony Cumia.  The hosts engaged in banter about the Nicolini and their own families, interspersed with discussions of Jimmy’s computer, Rich Voss’s animation project, and Jill Nicolini's appearance and job as a traffic reporter.  Rich Voss, a guest in the studio, participated in this segment.

The next segment focused on Rich Voss's perceived exclusion from a past Opie and Anthony event, with a humorous exchange about Voss’s self-esteem and a running gag about a “Guess the Sound” segment where Voss consistently failed, offering absurd answers like a screaming Asian woman and cell phones popping popcorn. The discussion veered into tangents including Tori Spelling's appearance, Voss's sobriety and lifestyle changes (quitting smoking, gambling, and red meat), a bizarre description of a body part, and his use of baby wipes versus rags. Further tangents included an absurd method for popping popcorn with cell phones, Lesbos residents wanting to disassociate the island's name from "lesbian," and a list of the "25 worst sitcoms ever," leading to reminiscing about old TV shows.  Howie Mandel called in, discussing his OCD, radio tour, and "Deal or No Deal," including a humorous anecdote about the "Million Dollar Madness" episode.  The conversation concluded with further discussion about OCD and personal relationships and intimacy, including anecdotes about Voss's romantic experiences.


The following segment featured Big A in the studio. The hosts began with sexually suggestive confessions about their relationships and preferences, discussing kissing, breasts, and sexual fantasies.  They then promoted Lewis Black's book signing.  A large portion was dedicated to underwear preferences, culminating in a humorous moment where the hosts and Big A exposed their underwear. This was followed by a discussion of a graphic video showing a young boy beheading a man, prompting reactions and discussion of the Iraq War.  This was then contrasted with a lighter topic—a viral video of a woman doing Wii Fit and hula hooping—which served as a humorous palate cleanser. Big A provided a comedic news segment filled with nonsensical "us" repetitions.  Further segments included discussions of the Wii Fit video, more comedic banter, and a failed attempt to get Big A to sing Journey songs due to technical difficulties. The show concluded with more casual conversation, plugs for various comedians and shows, and further sexually suggestive humor. Rich Voss promoted his comedy show and Jay Moore called in.

A phone call with Jay Moore, known for his Colin Quinn impersonation, followed.  The hosts discussed Moore’s comedic talents. Bob Kelly, present in the studio, seemingly participated in a video chat, shirtless in what appeared to be a steam room. The conversation shifted between comedy, personal anecdotes, and a running gag about Rich Voss’s emotional reaction to a Cher song that reminded him of his parents’ divorce.  The segment included vulgar language and crude humor, including discussions about bodily functions and a cake-in-the-face incident involving Bob Kelly and Big A.  Big A performed "Amazed" by Lone Star in a karaoke segment. The latter half heavily focused on Voss’s emotional response to the Cher song, with the hosts teasing him.  There were additional discussions about Voss’s personal life, his daughter’s college plans, and his comedic career. Attempts to have Big A perform lines from *Planes, Trains, and Automobiles* were made, hampered by technical difficulties (malfunctioning headset, needing printed lyrics), a recurring theme involving staff members Steve Corliss and Danny.

The final segment centered on a discussion about the merits of attending community college before a four-year university, driven by Rich Voss’s concerns about his daughter’s college plans and high tuition costs.  The discussion included frank talk about college partying, financial burdens on parents, and several off-color jokes.  A caller, Travis, shared his experience with significant student loan debt after earning a communications degree and his wild partying. Another caller recounted filing for bankruptcy at a young age.  Further callers included “Little Mouth Man” and a caller with multiple personalities, sometimes referred to as “Big A,” who eventually sang "Stand By Me" to close the show.  The segment included multiple "runner-up lines of the day," a brief discussion of a Dr. Pecoraro chiropractor commercial, and mentions of upcoming shows and events.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio shock jocks.  Opie and Anthony.  In the world of radio shock jocks, the biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their audience.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why?  Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good. 
[00:00:30]  Go screw.  Radio bad boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony.  Intimists, DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio shock jocks, Opie and Anthony.  All right, we get it.  We were number one across the board with men in Morning Drive Radio here in New York City.  Yeah.  We're doing better.  In men, we were number one. 
[00:01:00]  And in women, we crept up to number 375.  So I went to the acupuncturist, and this fine Chinese doctor popped about 20 needles in me.  Would you take a needle?  What do you need curing besides your alcoholism?  What's up, Anthony?  Is the date officially over?  Uh, no.  Do you need help?  Do you need help?  No, you.  Yes, I'm a hostage of love.  Oh, God.  But enough of this palaver. 
[00:01:30]  Let's get the show on the road.  And then what happened was, at 315, the lights and electricity came back on.  So then I was able to shower and stuff without using a flashlight and a candle.  I was really lucky, you know.  So how was your night?  Oh, my God.  Shut up.  Is that what happened when Dracula picked you up?  Oh, my God.  Good morning.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:02:00]  Here in New York City, last night, starting at 9 o'clock, all hell broke loose.  Thunder and lightning.  Just amazing.  An amazing light show for Manhattan.  Can you hear the wind on our block?  Yeah, I was kind of scared.  I thought my windows...  I thought this would be too inside.  But now that you mention it, Jimmy, yes, I did.  Jimmy and I live right next to each other in two different buildings.  And the wind was so unbelievable.  I really thought the windows were going to come crashing into my apartment. 
[00:02:30]  I actually put my shades down just in case because I wasn't...  Let me figure that stuff out.  Dude, I understand that.  But how these windows were bending and shaking.  Yeah.  I'm like...  Horrible, dude.  It was unbelievable.  I've never seen anything like that.  He's right on this one.  Into the world kind of stuff.  Cool.  We walked out of the supermarket and the wind was so bad, it almost blew my...  Wait a minute.  You said we?  Yeah, I have a friend.  We were getting some apples.  Apples.  Ooh!  Apples.  I did.  I bought two things and blueberries.  Blooberies?  Good, good, good. 
[00:03:00]  There's a parking garage and everybody from outside was standing in the garage.  And they were like, come on.  They were waving.  I said it was like a movie scenario.  It was that bad.  I've never felt one like that in my life.  It was amazing.  And then I just turned off all the lights and just watched the light show.  I watched lightning hitting across the way, let's just say, and taking out buildings.  I thought I was watching a war.  Because all of a sudden you see the lightning strike.  I saw it hit a building and then all the lights just go, poof, darkness everywhere.  Yeah. 
[00:03:30]  It was amazing, man.  I don't think I've seen one like that in a long time.  Yeah.  A long, long, long time.  That was the one needed to break the heat wave that we've had for the past few days.  No kidding.  I noticed, yeah, driving, a lot of trees were knocked down.  Yeah.  It's crazy.  But Kenny picks me up and he's one of these guys, like, he'll ask you, how was your night?  Not because he wants to know, because he wants to tell you about his night.  Oh, is that it? 
[00:04:00]  He's one of those guys.  How was your night, G.H.?  Well, Kenny, the thunder and lightning just amazing.  Well, let me tell you.  Yeah, exactly.  Jumps right in.  Well, it started at 9 o'clock.  By 9, 10, the lights went out completely.  I'm really lucky that I'm even here today.  I go, Kenny, but you got the BlackBerry.  He goes, well, that's my backup alarm.  Of course.  I go, well, then you're not lucky that you're here today.  You're going to wake up no matter what.  No, I mean here today at all alive. 
[00:04:30]  A tree could have come through the roof and killed me.  And then it's, he's so dramatic.  He's like, thank God the lights went back on.  I think he said 315.  He knows exactly.  Because I was thinking I might have to shower and stuff with a flashlight.  Oh, God, imagine that scene.  Big Kenny in a shower with a flashlight.  I have to wash my undercarriage.  So, love you, Kenny. 
[00:05:00]  Love you.  So, he just basically uses other people as a segue to get to his point.  Of course he does.  He's one of those guys.  One of those guys.  No, Kenny's actually really caring.  But, anyway.  I slept through everything.  Yeah, you were telling me that you went to sleep at 2 in the afternoon and pretty much slept the night?  It was pretty much, yeah, 2 in the afternoon and then slept until probably, I don't know, maybe 9, 9 at night.  And then we were up until about midnight, I guess. 
[00:05:30]  Yeah.  Maybe a little later.  And then back to sleep again.  That was it.  Boomf.  Well, welcome back to the show.  It's Wednesday, by the way.  I know.  I can't believe it.  I can't believe it's Wednesday.  It went from Sunday to Wednesday.  You look all awake and focused.  Oh, my God.  I just want to let you in.  We've had a couple good days of radio here.  Thank God.  No, I'm going to have to listen to some of the, I'm going to have to download a few of the shows to see what I said. 
[00:06:00]  Welcome to another week of radio, Anthony.  This is fantastic.  You're in a stupid time machine or something.  We didn't have any function last night, so.  Oh, thank God.  I think there's a function tonight.  Oh, no.  There's a function.  What's tonight's function?  I don't know.  I just go along.  I'll figure it out.  You've got to pace yourself, my friend.  Pace yourself.  You're a function, cuckold.  Cuckold.  You've got to just stand in the corner as you work in the room. 
[00:06:30]  No, I work the room, too.  You do, huh?  Of course I do.  I'm a big star.  And then Jimmy's looking very springish today, we noticed.  I got my light blue shirt on.  Jimmy usually looks kind of dark.  He likes the dark colors, but today you're looking very springy.  That's like, I want to say light blue, but there's a little, huh?  What's that color officially?  Periwinkle?  It's a bit periwinkle-ish.  No, that's baby blue. 
[00:07:00]  Yeah, it's baby blue.  Powder blue.  You know what?  I love Richard.  That doesn't look like Richard Pryor.  No, it looks like some kind of militant shirt you got on.  It's definitely a very cool shirt because it's a Richard Pryor shirt, but man, the cartoon  of his face doesn't look that accurate.  It looks angry.  Yeah, that looks like an older drawing.  Like, if you see Richard Pryor film live in concert in 1979, that looks like the picture  of his face that kind of came down on the stage behind him.  It's an older picture of his face, or kind of like a weird...  At first glance, if you were walking down the street wearing that, I would think you 
[00:07:30]  were like, you know, Black Power.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, you are?  Okay.  U.P. Newton was at that show, of course.  That's right.  He pointed him out.  He certainly did.  I'd like to say hello to U.P. Newton.  Had him stand up.  Everybody starts clapping.  I had no idea who it was.  He introduced the head of the Black Panthers.  Yeah.  You know, I love that.  I'm a truly belligerent.  That was a great special.  That one was...  Oh, Richard Pryor stuff.  Classic.  I saw Don Rickles' documentary last night. 
[00:08:00]  Still going strong at 80, your grandfather there, Jimmy.  I would love to really watch Rickles.  Me and Florentine were doing Vegas gigs years ago, and him and Harvey Korman were on the early  show, and we were doing late show.  It was back in 2003.  Yeah.  And we went to see him, but we missed him.  We had just missed his show.  No, wait.  It wasn't him and Harvey Korman.  It was Tim Conway and Harvey Korman.  Oh!  Rickles was on another time.  Yeah.  And we missed him.  Rickles, in this documentary, 80 and still going strong.  He's got a humpback, and he's just working the crowd. 
[00:08:30]  They give him a runway, and he just walks up and down this runway and just beats up everybody  in the audience.  He goes after the blacks, the Asians, the Jews, the mafia, Germans.  He's doing the goose step on stage.  I'm obsessed.  What year is it?  Yeah, that's what I was going to...  That's the point I'm making, though.  I'm obsessed with what's going on with comedy these days.  Yeah.  Rickles could still do it and get away with it because, you know, that's all he knows  from back in the day.  Yeah, they look at him and go, oh, he's always been like that. 
[00:09:00]  But if new guys come up and try doing that type of humor, they're never going to get  on TV.  They're not going to be on the Tonight Show.  None of that stuff.  Meanwhile...  Those type of guys are now buried.  Rickles was so great.  Like, he'd go on stage and kiss a black woman on the cheek.  Yeah.  And he'd walk over to the next person and go, hey, did I have any black on me?  Yeah, yeah.  It's just the greatest.  Oh, Jesus.  It's great.  Yes!  And the Asian humor.  Ugh.  You know, once again, I'm sitting there just watching this going, we do that on the radio,  we're fired.  And we would do it in the same way that Mr. Rickles is doing it, just trying to entertain 
[00:09:30]  people.  Yeah.  But we would be fired.  Simple as that.  But an amazing special.  I don't know, I got an advance copy.  Is it going to be on HBO, I'm thinking?  I think it is.  It's called Mr. Warmth.  Mr. Warmth or something like that?  That is his little nickname.  God, the old footage they got of him on the Tonight Show and, of course, the roasts and just  an amazing guy.  I feel like, you know, we missed the boat on Don Rickles. 
[00:10:00]  We're just too young.  Can you imagine if he was in his prime as we're doing our radio show?  He's the type of guy that would fit in perfect with this show.  Well, Hello, Dummy was a huge album for him.  It was like in the 60s, I think.  And it was, but it doesn't hold up like, only because what was considered very racy then,  like, oh my God.  Right.  And if you look back on it, it's kind of like, oh, okay, that's kind of, that's fun.  Right.  But, um, did you see the scene, uh, he's in his office and he's got literally pictures  with everybody, every president, every act. 
[00:10:30]  I mean, just everybody.  Frank Sinatra, the, you know, just imagine, right?  He goes down the wall.  It's hilarious.  He goes, dead, dead, dead, died of cancer, dead, dying, almost dead.  It's gruesome.  It was hilarious, though, because that's what I'm thinking.  I'm like, that's kind of gruesome because this is a wall of all his friends, basically.  Yeah.  And he's making fun of all of them.  On his way out, just about dead, dead, cancer, dead.  Jesus.  He's the real deal, though, man. 
[00:11:00]  Mr. Warmth.  Okay, it's on HBO On Demand.  Yeah, it was definitely worth a peek if you're into comedy.  He's old school, man.  He wears, like, a tux on stage, you know?  Yeah, yeah, that's, like, that's a throwback.  You never see that.  Yeah, well, I would love to get him on the show.  We've been trying for years.  Really?  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  He has some older black guy that, like, works with him.  Oh, yeah.  Okay, go ahead.  And the guy comes out to ask him something on the stage.  And Rickles goes, what, problem with the luggage? 
[00:11:30]  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Put a little background on that guy.  He's been with Rickles for 35, 36 years.  And he tells this really heartwarming story, like, he's a true friend.  After he beat him up, he goes, he's a true friend.  He's been with me since the beginning when I had no money.  You find out who your real friends are when you don't have money and you got friends.  And he's been with me for 35, 36 years.  And then he goes, but now that I've made it, scram, stupid, or whatever.  He just says, I don't need you anymore. 
[00:12:00]  Just beating up everybody.  Problem with the luggage.  His timing, it's sickening how good his timing is.  It's so funny.  Yeah.  It's like just a bomb.  He just drops a bomb in your lap.  He's great, man.  Yeah.  And he does it with a wink.  I notice he does it with a wink and kind of a nod.  That's how he gets away with a lot of his crazy lines.  It's Rickles.  If you're offended at Don Rickles, you should just leave the planet. 
[00:12:30]  You're an idiot.  Yeah.  That's what he's all about.  Get off the thing we're circling the sun on.  You're annoying.  Hey, is there any way to get some clips from that documentary?  We could just kind of sprinkle them into the show today.  I should have brought it in.  I forgot.  I'll bring it in tomorrow.  We'll get that line that Jimmy just said and some others.  Phone number 877-212-ON-A.  Let's say hi to Max in Dallas.  Max, what's up?  I understand you guys got a little bit of wind and lightning here last night. 
[00:13:00]  Okay.  All right, Dallas.  All of us people down here in Texas feel sorry for you.  Shut up.  Get up in the morning and provide a good show.  What do you say?  We're being girls about it, Max?  It was pretty amazing last night, though.  I haven't seen one of those, like I said, in a very, very long time.  Also, let me point something out.  Dallas gets some severe weather at times, and certain parts of Texas, of course, the  Midwest, they get tornadoes, and they look at us like we're idiots when, you know, we 
[00:13:30]  get these big lightning and thunderstorms with a lot of wind, downed trees, things like  that.  But let me remind you, when you get a dusting of snow and your whole friggin' existence  gets thrown into the Stone Age, we kind of chuckle at you, okay?  Hey, Jesus, they get a little dusting, and there's people on garbage pail lids sleigh  riding like it's magical dust from heaven. 
[00:14:00]  You're so right.  We all look forward to the footage of Dallas after they get their snow.  Yeah, so, you know, let us run with this one.  You know, it was windy.  It was loud.  It was, you know, a lot of thunder and lightning.  We understand you people get tornadoes.  They got video of just cars stopped on the highway with everyone out of their cars just  scratching their head.  We don't know what to do with that.  What is this stuff?  We don't know what to do.  It's slippery.  I can't drive.  Buffalo laughs at you, Dallas.  Oh, yeah.  Shut up. 
[00:14:30]  And, well, I had to wake up to find out that the Lakers beat the Celtics last night.  I love basketball.  I love playoff basketball.  But these games are on too late for me.  Oh, the playoffs is still on?  I watched the first freaking quarter, and it was already, like, 10 o'clock.  Yeah.  I can't stay up to watch these games.  It's hard, especially when it's East Coast, West Coast.  Yeah.  They have to put it at some kind of time where they can get to it after work.  And by that time, everybody here is tired.  Well, yeah.  Everyone's sleepy.  Celtics still lead the series two games to one. 
[00:15:00]  Kobe Bryant with 36 points last night.  And the front page of our paper, foul play, playoffs rigged, bias for top stars.  That naughty ref that was caught, like, gambling and stuff.  Yeah.  He's, what, there's a trial going on right now.  And he's admitting to a lot of stuff, saying that, you know, the refs are supposed to call  fouls against another team to make the playoffs go a little longer, these series go a little  longer.  Because, of course, it's more money for the NBA the longer these series go. 
[00:15:30]  Yeah, he's saying it wasn't an isolated thing with him.  Sort of happens with the other refs.  Pretty big stuff.  Pretty big shakeup.  Steven S. from Bayshore.  Hey, Ope, don't let that Kennedy killer cheapen your thunderstorm experience.  Dallas sucks.  Yeah, it's time.  We're going to beat up Dallas all morning now.  That's what you get, Max.  You and your dumb little snow flurries.  Right, we understand.  We weren't saying we were under the bed scared. 
[00:16:00]  Yeah.  I think how I described it and Jimmy described it was, wow, that was pretty amazing last  night.  I know.  Blew my hat off.  What?  It blew your hat off?  You had a hat?  I did.  It was a straw fedora.  You know how I walk around the neighborhood.  A straw fedora.  Like that original Don in The Godfather 2.  That's how he walks around with people kissing his ring with that straw fedora.  Yeah, at one point I walked outside and went, it's already here. 
[00:16:30]  Right?  Well, the finger of God.  Of course.  Twister joke.  Steven S. from Bayshore.  There are Don Rickles clips on The Tonight Show all over YouTube.  Oh.  So why don't we sprinkle a few of those into the show today, okay?  For the great Don Rickles.  Sprinkle, sprinkle.  Yes, Jimmy.  Just makes me laugh, Rickles.  He's just a naughty, naughty boy.  I watched one of his Letterman appearances.  There's one from like 82.  And I think he was new, because now I think the only TV he does is Letterman. 
[00:17:00]  And it was, or in New York, he'll do his Letterman.  It was one of his first Lettermans, and he just sits down, and he just attacks everybody.  He would just attack Ed McMahon on The Tonight Show.  There was no script.  No.  He would just attack you.  You would not want to be on a show with him.  It would just be getting ripped apart.  He's going to shred you.  Yeah.  Old school.  Yeah.  Old school.  John Wayne died 29 years ago today. 
[00:17:30]  29 years ago?  The Duke?  The Duke.  They're still cleaning.  Oh, the Duke!  29 years ago today  We're going to take our first break  It's the Opie and Anthony Show  Phone number 877-212-O-N-A

He's a regular 
[00:18:30]  He says  I'm 24 years old  And I wish I got into Don Rickles some more  But honestly  I think Don Rickles equals  Mr. Potato Head from Toy Story  How sad is that?

[00:22:30]  Didn't he  Mr. Harrison did  Quite well for himself  Yeah  Ringo Starr was a bust  On the traveling all stars  Or something he called it  Oh  He's got to go out  With 800 people  In order for anyone  To buy a ticket  To his show  Right  Luke  I'm bringing people  With me  Liverpudlian thing  It's not endearing anymore  It's just stupid  I think Mick Cartney  I didn't like him  On his own either  Wings had a couple  Of good songs  A couple  Wings had hit after hit 
[00:23:00]  Back in the early 70s  Wings greatest hits  Come on  Maybe I'm amazed  At the wave  I'm young  That's a pretty big song  How about Jet  How's that go  Jet  Live and let die  Was a biggie  Live and let die  You're right  Okay  Give me the list  From Wings greatest hits  Band on the run  Band on the run  Was a great song  I didn't really like it  I loved band on the run  Oh you know what I hated  Someone's knocking at the door  Somebody's ringing the bell  Let him in 
[00:23:30]  Yeah  How about this one  I hate that  What is that  I don't know  Oh is that what it was  How's that go  Mike  Something about a butter pie  Admiral Halsey notified me  He hadn't had a bath  And he couldn't go to sleep  Had another look  And I had a cup of tea  And a butter pie  The butter wouldn't melt  So we put it in a pie  Remember that  Oh then they go  Hands across the water  Right  Hands across the water 
[00:24:00]  Water  We're so sorry  Uncle Albert  Uncle Albert  Slash Admiral Halsey  Right  Two songs  What does that mean  Butter wouldn't melt  We put it in a pie  It means P-U  Yeah why wouldn't  We're so sorry  I don't know  Why put it in the pie  Uncle Albert  Where are they  On the set of the thing  With John Carpenter  Look I mean  This is the greatest hits  You got another day  The leg wouldn't melt  So I put it in the pie  Yeah yeah 
[00:24:30]  Silly love song  Another great  One by Wings  Oh silly love song  Stunk  Junior's farm was good  With a little walk  What  How'd silly love songs go  Silly love songs  Too early  People  Super sappy  Yeah  Of course it was  Yeah  This one  Remember this one Jimmy 
[00:25:00]  Yeah  This is what reminds me of  We were going to  Nanny's house  Yeah  My dad and my mom  In the front seat  My mom would smoke  On her sand bottom  Ashtray in the car  The one with the  Sand bean bag  Or something  Nice  And this is the type  Of music that  Play in the car  These are all these songs  I just remember  Being in the car  Driving somewhere  To some drunk  Relative's house  That's pretty much it  It was the 70s  It's like  Oh let's drive  To Queens  To go see this aunt  And watch her drink  Fall down 
[00:25:30]  Super 70s weekend  Geez what are they doing  Down the hall  CBS FM  Stapling people's heads  Vomiting on each other  Two lesbians  Fighting over  A Louisville slugger  Have the ghouls  Started broadcasting  From over there yet  They have huh  Yeah  We're going to  Crash their studio  We got to make it good though  Yeah  Yeah we're going to  Crash  CBS FM  How about number 90  Rock  Let him in 
[00:26:00]  Oh it's awful  Yeah it is a bad one  He was all about  Inviting people  Into his house  But if you did that  In real life  You would get shot  Especially if you were  A hooker  Who didn't want  To be on the pill  You wanted to  Rape him for 200 million  Come on in  What a dope  Well put a lock on  Let's hear  Let him in  Oh yeah this one  Duh  Duh  Duh  Duh  Ponderous  Yeah  Somebody ringing  The bell  Are they  Someone's knocking  At the door 
[00:26:30]  Somebody's ringing  The bell  He's going to  Bite him in  Do me a favor  Open the door  And let him in  He's just  He got to a point  Where he's just like  He's sitting at home  Someone goes  Ding  Dong  I got a song here  Somebody's knocking  At the door  Somebody's ringing  The bell  And they think  He's a genius  I got a song  I'm pushing  A shopping cart  I'm pushing  A shopping cart  He's just watching  Someone baking a pie  He doesn't care  Anything  And came up  With that butter  What 
[00:27:00]  I'm a genius  Yeah  I can write  About anything  I think Paul McCartney  Is lonely  Yeah  He wants people  To come to his house  My favorite song  That he did was  The pot roast is cold  On the table  Could you throw it  In the oven love  Right  Idiot  I'm throwing away  A bunch of right shoes  Alright you're making  A good point  All of them have  Fresh treads on them  How does he  Don't smell like  New rubber from the store  Why didn't anyone  Smash him for  Writing a song 
[00:27:30]  About someone  Ringing a doorbell  Cause he was just  A beetle  A few years before  Yeah  So they gave him leeway  Yeah  Naming just people  Who might ring his bell  Yeah  Yeah  Exactly  How about the  Dominican home invasion gang  Letting everyone in  Alright  Come on in everybody  So we can dance  The night away  And then okay  What happens now  A musical interlude  Oh I thought  I thought it was  Bad gas 
[00:28:00]  From the supper  I had a bad  Super  Me butter pie  That's probably how  He came up with  This part of the song  He just had bad gas  Some pot roast  You're right  He's a hack  It was awful  Lennon was a little  Like they complimented  Each other I think  Because Lennon was  A little too out there  I think later in his career  Before he got killed  He started getting  A little more 
[00:28:30]  I don't know  Like popular  Like he could have been  More what  Hit oriented  Yeah  What was that last album  He put out  Well I mean  Hit oriented  He came up with  The greatest hit  Of all time  Imagine  Yeah  When you talk about hits  That's the biggie  Right there  But there was so many  His songs were just  Off the god damn wall  99% of his stuff  Is unlistenable  Yeah  It's Yoko warbling  In the background  It's some kind of  Odd eclectic  Friggin  And you know 
[00:29:00]  Yoko Ono  Ruined her  Her son's career  I went and saw  Sean Lennon  In the park  Central Park  A couple summers ago  The guy sounds  Just like John Lennon  If not better  He's an amazing vocalist  But it was all  Just  Horrendous sounds  Coming from the stage  And this beautiful voice  Coming from Sean Lennon  She was coaching him  Well the influence  Because John  You know  John would have  Kept her in check  And Sean Lennon  Probably would have  Been an amazing artist 
[00:29:30]  I think he was  Pretty whipped though  As far as Yoko went  Yeah  John  It's too bad  Because I mean  You know  Because John Lennon's  Other son  Was a hack  Julian  Was a hack  Julian  Why you didn't like  His little 80's  Hit song he had there  He had one hit  And that was because  His father was John  But Sean Lennon  Could have been somebody  What was it called  The song the 80's  I don't remember anymore  I used to have to play it  You'll remember that  On rock radio  Yes  The album was  Volat  And I think it was  Too Late for Goodbye  Wow  Stunt brains 
[00:30:00]  Stepping in  For our brains  A little motion picture  1942  Ah that one  Jimmy you gotta start  Giving stump brain respect  He came up with that one  Please I'm in awe of him  Standing in front of  His computer and googling  He googled  I know  Did you just google that  You called it  He did know that  If this comes on the radio  If I'm driving  I might give it a listen  For nostalgia  Oh that was  I actually thought  This was Lennon  Did you  In the video  He fakes having a harmonica  There's nothing in his hands 
[00:30:30]  He's going to go  Oh really  Yeah it's great  Hey uh  Did you write this  It does sound like Lennon  McCartney's original lyric  To yesterday  Was scrambled eggs  Yeah  What  What are you talking about  Apparently he's got a food issue  But that was the original lyric  They would write a song  And he would throw in a  A lyric to hold the place  And it was scrambled eggs  For yesterday  Oh  Scrambled legs  What was he writing about  George Harrison's brain  Oh no  See I can have fun too guys  But uh 
[00:31:00]  You know  My favorite Lennon song  Is a working class hero  I like that part better  Yeah  Yeah man  Lennon had some great  When you got past the pop stuff  Lennon had some great stuff  Later in his career  Later in his career  He only made it to what  40  We all shine on  Something like that  Is that the name of it  Oh yeah that one  I didn't even know  We were going down this road today  But if we're going to talk about  The Beatles  We got to play my favorite clip  Once again  And Jay Moore turned me on to this  It was a documentary called 
[00:31:30]  Oh god  Rock and roll circus  What was it called  Ugh  What was it called  I forgot  But basically  It was Lennon  Oh I can't even remember  Lennon  McCartney  McCartney  Mick Jagger  What  Clapton was there  Who else  Was Hendrix there  No  I'm guessing he was dead by that point  I think he was  He died in 71  But they got  You're kidding  How did it happen  They got  They got together  To do just  Oh Jethro Tull was there  Ian Anderson  Who  The Who  Thank you 
[00:32:00]  The Who was there  They got all these  Amazing rock stars together  Back in the day  When they were all  Just massive  And then they made everyone  Wear kind of like  Raincoats in the audience  It was just the most  Twisted documentary  Gallagher was coming out  Yeah  And at the end of it  They do a super jam  Where you got  Mick Jagger  Lennon  Eric Clapton  Ian Anderson  Who was the other guy  The Who  Oh The Who  They're all on stage  At the same time  And John Lennon  Insists that  Yoko Ono  Is in this league  And she's on stage  With all these 
[00:32:30]  Great great  Rock stars  Do we have that clip  She should have been  Getting him coffee  So listen  Stop  This is one of my  Favorite clips of all time  And I thank Jay Moore  To this day  For turning me on  To this documentary  What's the name  Of it  We should put it on  ONA Radio.com  The Rolling Stones  Rock and Roll Circus  Rolling Stones  Rock and Roll Circus  And John Lennon  Insisted that  Yoko comes with him  When it's obviously  A hang with the guys  It's just the guys  Hanging  And Yoko  You got that clip  You gotta set it up  Like  Alright  Before she starts 
[00:33:00]  Her wailing  But  Alright  Start it up  So  Just picture  It's everybody  You can imagine  Jamming  Jamming  That's Yoko  It gets a lot worse  They're just jamming  Man  A bunch of guys  They're all  Huge rock stars  They're jamming  Kind of drown her out 
[00:33:30]  Oh yeah  They're turning up  The volume  These go to  Eleven  This isn't even  The best part  She really starts  Wailing later on  Did anyone think 
[00:34:00]  This sounded good  Just a little taste  But why did he have to be part of that  Why?  Yeah why did he force her on her  That was annoying  It's like why don't you just  Tell her to be your wife  And hang with her  And take naked pictures 
[00:34:30]  And then stop  Yeah you don't sing  You're not musical at all  Just sit back  Let John Lennon  Take care of the music  Honey talk to this man  He wants me to sign something  I'll be right out  Oh it's on YouTube  As Yoko Ono  Ono in parentheses  You gotta watch this  Oh yeah  That guy looks like  Dick Cavett  But look at these weirdos  In the audience 
[00:35:00]  Definitely link this to  ONARadio.com  Goddamn hippies  Was that Lennon or her  You can never tell them apart  After a while  That's her  Yeah that's her  And then someone  Put their own graphics  Up on the screen  Are they effing with me  Because she's just  Wailing and ruining everything  She is  And she's not being artistic  She's just making noise  Hey she would say  She's being artistic  Jimmy  You ever see the naked pictures  Of her  I'm gonna shove my bow  Down this bitch's throat  That  Look at the audience  They're all tripping  Not much grooming  There's John Lennon 
[00:35:30]  Make him believe  It's sounding good  Oh my god  Just shut up would ya  Why wouldn't he once  Just stop being polite  And say that  Alright  Awful  Say hi to Steve  In New Hampshire  Steve  Oh my god  I think Yoko Ono  Invented the rock scream  That  Not quite a rock scream  Yeah exactly  Just the noise  Sounded like someone 
[00:36:00]  Kicking a dog  Yeah  It really was  Just that  That kind of  The dogs do  Hey  We were gonna start  This break  But we obviously  Went off on a crazy tangent  Yesterday  I spent  Yesterday  Scrambled eggs  Scrambled eggs  Paul McCartney  Coming out of my  Guitarist's head  That's gonna make me  Laugh all day though  Paul McCartney  Just inviting people  To his house  In every other song  How lonely is this guy  Come on over  Please  You want me to bring 
[00:36:30]  The Parcheesi  Stupid Parcheesi  Hey wait  E-Rock said that  Ozzy does that too  With pizza toppings  Replaces the lyrics  With placeholders  I wonder if  They do that  With a completely  Simple  Nonsensical  Lyric  So they don't  Get caught up  In thinking  That that should  Be the lyric  It makes sense  Like scrambled eggs  You can hold the note  But you would never  Think that  You're not gonna  Get caught  Married to any  Particular word  Well let's ask  A musician  Yeah Steve  Steven Carr  Who has been known

You've got a beautiful girl  That's a good  You're right  That's what I'm getting at  He should definitely have one  Because he has a lot more money  And a better future than I do  Who doesn't?  You mentioned those qualities

What's so wrong about getting that?  You feel great afterwards  I feel great 
[01:07:00]  You lose a lot of uh  You feel all cleaned out  Do you?  Oh yeah man  It just makes you feel good  It does  Does it though?  Yeah  You feel like you're worked out  Yeah  You feel like  It looks like you have abs  Because you've been working them  It's great  It's one of the best feelings  When you can look down and go  Wow  That was good  I don't like having to wait there an hour though  For things to cool down  It's like  It's like Chernobyl  You gotta wait for the  The half life 
[01:07:30]  Dab dab dab dab  With paper  Dab dab dab  Yes  Exactly  When you're done  Do you take a wet rag too?  Besides  No  No  Take a chamois  A car chamois  I take the wet  Baby wipes  The baby wipes  You're not using the baby wipes, Rich?  No, see  When you use  Because a rag is more rugged  Rugged  Why are you  What is  What?  Yeah, I always use a rag  I'm very obsessive about that  How about a driveway scraper?  That's also rugged 
[01:08:00]  What's the matter with you?  Not rugged  Steal wool  Ow  Because what you're saying is  Why don't you put soap on a porcupine  And it'll say  Run up there  Way to go, Fred Flintstone  What the hell?  You're gonna wipe your  No  You have a baby at home  Use the baby wipes  No, because that's just  You know what  It's the greatest invention ever  Ever  It's not good for that  Oh, it is  What I'm saying is  Because that's just like  Taking toilet paper  And putting water on it  You need something  No  Yeah  It's got like 
[01:08:30]  It's got aloe in it  Voss  Baby wipes  They even took the baby  Out of the name  So adults feel comfortable  Buying them now  They're just wipes  Called fag wipes  Get a little aloe on there  Moisture  It's nice  Yeah  And you got them at home  Because you got the baby  Use them  But Voss likes a rag  He's saying  A rag  The consistency of a rag  Voss is saying  Is a little rougher  Which he feels  Does a more efficient job  But that's not the truth  What's the truth?  That the baby wipes  Work well  You don't need to 
[01:09:00]  These are not  Nooks  This is not a piece  Of concrete you're cleaning  This is your flesh  Which is  Yes  Soft  Yeah, but there's  All kinds of obstacles  Down there  No, there's not  In your case  Maybe a man's torso  Hair, warts  You got all kinds of stuff  Do you go and wash your car  After you're done  With the same rag?  No  Are you driving around  In a brown car?  Just keep it next  To the night table  Just leave it there 
[01:09:30]  Wait  Next to the night table  I don't know  I don't clean my soap  You gotta clean up  I understand what  Anything you're saying  Baby wipes  You got them at home  I'm gonna try it  I just like to  You call us tomorrow  After you use the baby wipes  Today, alright?  I'm gonna try the baby wipes  I can't believe you haven't  Been turned on to the baby wipes yet  Alright, what is this, Rich?  She's getting beat up 
[01:10:00]  That's Once Were Warriors  The Japanese version  Is the girl getting beat up  She's getting beat up  And punched in the face  By a guy  Wrong  Uh, Danny's calling  Bravo Sierra on this  By the way  And a lot of people  Wait, of course  First of all  Really?  There wasn't a second  Where I thought  This was actually happening 
[01:10:30]  Well, I'll say this  Before we give it away  A lot of people  Are believing this is real  Oh my god  It's such crap  This was very hot  Yesterday afternoon  Very hot  Do you know  If this actually  Happened and worked  Everyone on this planet  Would be dead  You can't do that  Danny also is  Oh, absolutely  Saying fake  Basically what you heard  Was a cell phone  Popping popcorn  Four cell phones  I think it was  Four cell phones together  Yeah  And then what happens is 
[01:11:00]  They all pointed  The antennas  Or the top of the phones  At each other  It was  All the cell phones  Were sitting on a table  It left like a little  You know  Square empty spot  In the middle  Where they put  Corn kernels  And uh  They turned their phones on  Or called them  Because they were vibrating  And ringing  And then the corn  Started popping  Do you know  What it would take  To pop corn  With a friggin' cell phone  You'd be  Pudding head  All of us  And how many places  Like airports or whatever  When there's a flight delay  Are there 30 or 40 phones 
[01:11:30]  Going at one point  In a small area  Yeah  The popcorn would be  All over the town  Of course it would  So  Ugh  What was that  Popcorn  Who wants to hear  A 58 year old guy  Fart  I know  Oh my god  Yeah  Bring in the youngsters  Does it matter  That's a good point  Good point  What's it matter  After that 40  It's not hot anymore  Right  Good point  So  Yeah  It does look fake 
[01:12:00]  The more I look at this  So what do you think  They had something really hot  Under the table  Yeah  Had to be something like that  A little trickery  Had to be  Jimmy you think there was  Some wizardry  Happening here  There was something  A bit of wizardry  So this is  The sound  The fake sound  Of  Popcorn popping  Because of cell phones  There was something hot  Under there  Yeah  What is she screaming about 
[01:12:30]  Anthony's autism  That's what gives away  The fact that  This is a fake video  Because no one gets  That excited  That popcorn popping  Goodness  Oh it's popping  Popcorn  Let me scream  Like I'm being murdered  I would  If that thing I hold  By my skull all day  Is popping popcorn  Yeah that's screamable  Alright Jimmy 
[01:13:00]  You're right  What dumb cell phones  They have too  One looks like a razor  That table looks too thick  To put something hot under  You know what I mean  What do you know  About tables  Look how thick  Look how thick that  And it seems like  That would  Catch fire  Or something  You know what I mean  Yeah it seems like it  Wait you never heard  Of special effects  It could be anything  The table could be  Metal top  Where it's  Really thin  Where the popcorn thing is  Could be someone under there 
[01:13:30]  With a torch  Benny Hanna  Yeah  Benny Hanna  Could be one of those tables  I was reading an article  On cell phones yesterday  Yes  You hear what they're doing  With these things  It's making phone calls  To other people  Texting  What  I guess they're doing this  A little bit in Times Square  Outside the MTV building  But basically  You use your cell phone  To jump into a  Multiplayer video game  Really  In a public place  So imagine Times Square  Big screen  And all of a sudden 
[01:14:00]  If you're just hanging  Around Times Square  You can get in  A quick game  Of whatever  And you can  Control the guy  With your cell phone  With other people  In public  How cool is that  I did not hear that  And they said  This technology  Could take off  At airports  And places  Where we all hang  When we're just bored  There'll be a big screen  You can jump on  And play a game  Of whatever  I don't know  If you can do  With Call of Duty  Or anything like that  I'm sure the games  Are primitive right now  But that's the technology  They're working on  Why don't you just  Talk to each other  Why don't we just 
[01:14:30]  Talk to each other  Just yap  Yeah  I know the other  At the concert  The other night  You were able to  Text messages  Up onto a big screen  Right  Up by the stage  Right  So people were texting  Like inside references  To the show  And stuff like that  At the STP show  Yeah  The video's up on  ONAradio.com  The popcorn  Popping thing  All right  Residents of Lesbos  Where  Lesbos  Where 
[01:15:00]  Lesbos  Yeah  And I think that's  How they pronounce it  Yeah  Right  Lesbos  It's an island  One of the Greek islands  Triangular shaped  Smells like fish  The residents of Lesbos  Want to stop gay women  From being called lesbians  Because the term lesbian  Came from the island of Lesbos  Did it?  I do believe yes  Why don't they just stop it?  So there's a lot of controversy  Hmm  For years gay women  Have flocked 
[01:15:30]  Oh this guy I guess  For years gay women  Have flocked  Another sushi story  To the island of Lesbos  To taste the sushi  Smash it in my face  It's stupid sushi guy I guess  Sushi  This guy is horrible  For years gay women  Have flocked  To the village of Erasos  On the island of Lesbos  It's a haven  Primarily because  It was the home  Of the ancient Greek poet Sappho  Who wrote of her love  For other women 
[01:16:00]  Hmm  But now lesbians  Feel under attack  That the Greek government  Renamed the island  After its capital  Mytilene  Because it was so embarrassed  By the term lesbian  The man who is bringing  This case is insistent  That it is not frivolous  He says it's a fundamental  Freedom  To have one's identity  Taken seriously  And so the judges  Have to decide  Whether the islanders  Human rights  Have been violated  Is it fair  That a lesbian  Can't be called a lesbian  Just in case somebody  Thinks they are  A lesbian  What? 
[01:16:30]  Yes, indeed  What?  That was a ridiculous ending  To a ridiculous story  Hold on  A lesbian  Can't be a lesbian  If you're a lesbian  Wait, I gotta go that again  Identity taken seriously  And so the judges  Have to decide  Whether the islanders  Human rights  Have been violated  Is it fair  That a lesbian  Can't be called a lesbian  Just in case somebody  Thinks they are  A lesbian  I have no idea  How does an inanimate object 
[01:17:00]  Have human rights  Human rights  Well they're saying  They're not saying the island  They're saying that  The residents of the island  Their rights are being violated  Because the name  Les  Lesbian  Was taken from them  And it's just  It's just a bunch of  Just homophobes  Why don't they stop  In Greece  Alright  You hear the Olympics naked  Stop it  They have changed  The name of the island  To  Wait, do it again  What?  No  I won't  Oh, you won't?  Well guess what  John Wayne died  29 years ago today 
[01:17:30]  God, did I  Screw that up  Yeah, but you know what though  I mean now  All of a sudden  Some of the furniture stores  Are suing  Because they don't want  The carpet  Word sullied  Like  Cats are suing  God almighty  It's kind of cool though  If you  If you were born  On this island  You're known as a lesbian  A lesbian  Like being an American  Lesbos  Or what have you  The fish are suing 
[01:18:00]  They want their smell back  Yeah  How old am I  I say that  I say that  Because this next clip  There's a man  Who's proud to be  A lesbian  I am proud to be  A lesbian  Well, he certainly is  That could be  The greatest clip  I'm proud to be  A lesbian  Wacky Greeks  I am proud to be  A lesbian  But are you a lesbian?  A lesbian  From lesbos  Not  Homosexual 
[01:18:30]  Mr. Lambrew alleges  That islanders are subject  To international disgrace  Because of the sexual connotations  I am not a Mytilenean  I am from lesbos  When I say I am from Mytilenean  Or my sister calls herself  A Mytilenean  This does not indicate  Our true origin  She is ashamed  To call herself a lesbian  This is unacceptable  Local craftspeople  Are dependent on the gay tourists  And are worried about  The impact of the case

I sometimes I'll sit  For an entire hour  In my session  And not say a word  And just shake her hand  She says it's good  But then I  And then I'll go home 
[01:35:30]  And I scald my hands  Yeah  I must just look silly  Tell her to stop being so lazy  Yeah right  She didn't want to work that day  You know what  She is working  I have put my therapist  In a whole new tax bracket  She lives in a beautiful  Gated community  When I first met her  She was in a small condo  And now I've really upped the  I think I'm a dream client  I think we just took it too far  Because we really were trying  The whole time  To get you to shake hands  Before he starts shaking again  And we wanted you to touch  Goopy stuff  I want you to stop

[01:39:00]  Who don't have TiVo  And I gotta tell people  The only reason  This show is a hit  Because it's  It's the dumbest concept ever  There is no concept  There's no trivia  There's no stunt  There's no skill  You can be a moron  But here comes the compliment  Dumbest concept ever  But the reason  This show is a hit  Is because of my friend  Howie Mandel  Thank you  You make it really  Really interesting  To watch  I didn't realize  And I've just come  To the conclusion  I am brilliant  It is  Talented I am  Hi Howie  You are  To have me on the show

[01:40:00]  That would make it  The island of Homos  Homos  But not that  I gotta run  Ah  There he goes  I will come  I will come in live  I will definitely  Come in live  Next time I'm in New York  And I won't touch you  That's my promise  To you  See  Good  Thank you  That's why I'm there  Not to be touched  Howie Mandel  Thank you Howie  Thanks Howie  Bye  A quickie from Howie  Deal or no deal  Yes  I love the fact  He's been so upfront  And honest about his OCD  I mean  That really is 
[01:40:30]  Kind of  I guess it's hard  To camouflage  Disguise it  Yeah  It's hell on earth  It really is  You gotta kind of  Be honest about it  I guess  My mom's a big  Sufferer of the OCD  So I know  Something about it  Sucks  Why don't you just  Like tell them  Stop doing that  I  You know what  I wish you could just  Say that  Stop that  Oh okay  It would have saved us  A lot of grief over the years  But it's  I didn't realize I was doing it  It's a tick in your brain  That just keeps ticking  And ticking  And ticking  And ticking  And everyone else  You know  You get past the tick  But OCD people 
[01:41:00]  Sometimes never get past the tick  Some guy brought up on  Pal Talk here  And I think of that one all the time  When I hear OCD  Mark Summers  Who used to do that  Super sloppy double dare  How he did that  I have no idea  How he got around  All the goopy  How  Disgusting things  He looked at his bank account  You think that was  Money cures everything  Nickelodeon was paying that much money  To the host of sloppy  Super sloppy double dare  I think he did very well for himself  Yeah  Yeah  The one thing though  That I think about 
[01:41:30]  Was he had a rug  Like a Persian rug  In his house  I read this in an interview  And you know Persian rugs  They got the fringe  On the outside of it  He would spend hours  On his hands and knees  Straightening each little strand  Of fringe  On a Persian rug  Mark Summers  Mark Summers  Who is the host of  The Nickelodeon show  And straightening each one out  And then stand up  Look  Back down on his hands and knees  For hours  He would do this  You know how many threads 
[01:42:00]  There are  On the fringe  Of a Persian rug  72,000  Perhaps more than I've heard  Do you know how badly  I would love to live with him  And just set the fan up  When he finishes  And watch them blow  Or just kick the rug  Back on your knees  Stupid  Just kick it  So not only does all the fringe go  But the whole rug  Goes a little askew  Yeah  With a dog log on my shoe  Now  What do you think  Of those apples  You're a worse woman  My mom was telling  An OCD story 
[01:42:30]  Very recently  She was  She was  She was somewhere  Getting some  Some adjustments  Ah  And there was a guy  That was suffering  From OCD  So bad  That he has to  He walks  How can I explain this  He walks a couple steps forward  And then he walks  Ten steps backwards  He's a Paula Abdul fan  Right  And then he walks  A few steps forward  Opposites attract  And then he walks backwards  This is his OCD  He's in a living hell  He has to walk  Ten steps back 
[01:43:00]  Ten steps forward  Ten steps back  Then maybe eleven steps forward  Does he turn around  Or does he walk backwards  Just backwards  Alright that's silly  This is his hell  That he's in  If he turned around  It would be normal  So let's say  And this was the situation  He had a meal on a table  And he had to walk  Like ten steps forward  Then ten steps back  Then eleven steps forward  Then ten steps back  Eventually he's going to  Get to the table  And get his damn meal  Right  Maybe he's just not sure  This is the hell he's in though  And this stupid person  At this place  Starts yelling at the guy 
[01:43:30]  And goes  Oh just grab your food  And they're supposed to be  The ones  That should understand  What the hell is going on  They've had enough  Of his walking backwards  And cut it out  Stop it already  Why don't they just put  His dinner in front of him  And behind him  Part of it behind him  How about this  That's good  You do what Saddam  Did to keep his troops  From retreating  You put landmines  Behind him  What do you think of that  That Saddam was crafty 
[01:44:00]  Exactly  Ten steps  Ten steps  Oh  Ten steps  That's what I should do  I should talk backwards  And then try to close  Did you know that  John Wayne died  29 years ago  Did he  Oh I love this song  So my mom gave this person  A talking to  Good  Basically telling this  This dope of a woman  That's supposed to understand  That this guy can't help himself 
[01:44:30]  Oh that guy  Oh I think me and mom  Talk to the guy  And straighten him out  Because she's in that world  Unfortunately  You know  Oh you can make  All the jokes you want  I don't give a crap  I have  It really is a hell  To some degree  I mean nobody wants  To shake anybody else's hand  Nobody wants to touch  Strange people  I wiped  I wiped  Your baby's  You know what  On my head  No you did  Baby diaper mustache  I know  You don't have any  OCD issues yourself  I do  When you pack  Oh is that you  When you pack

[01:45:30]  That might get me a little bit  Because I gotta make sure  Doors are locked  I have to  When I leave my house  In the morning  Sometimes I get around  The corner and go  Did I shut my garage door  Did I hit the button  And then you go all the way  Shut it  If there's like a certain  Type of color person  In your neighborhood  You don't peek out the shades  You know until they leave  You don't do that  What do you mean Rich  Yeah what do you mean  Nothing  It could have been funny  If I was you know  If I really committed  Warren's serious  If I committed  It wasn't just 
[01:46:00]  Being completely honest  If you're sleeping  When your dresser drawer  And it's partly open  You don't get to get up  And close  I do actually  That I kind of get  We all have a little bit  Of that  What you gotta shut the drawer  If your drawer is open  Who doesn't  Damn  I'm there too  What are you queer  That's crazy  Yeah I do  It is kind of sad  I can sleep with something  Cracked a little bit  But I like doors  To be closed and open  I can have scary things  In the room  Like if something  Looks like scary  What's that a real emotion  Love  Child friendship  Yeah 
[01:46:30]  An AA meeting  Yeah  All of the above  I guess Jill doesn't  Sleep over that  Because she scares you  She doesn't scare me  All the emotions  That she's pumping  Through your body  No  Scares you my friend  Wonderful  You sleep very soundly  Are you gonna embrace  Those fine emotions  You're getting  From this Jill Nicolini  I do  Alright that's good to hear  Do you cuddle  Very good to hear  Yes  When you're sleeping  You put your arm around  Yes we're very  We're very cuddly  Very touchy feely 
[01:47:00]  Very hold on  While we're sleeping  Kind of a thing  Things like that  I'll throw myself  Under the bus  Last night  The lightning and thunderstorm  Started here in New York City  And I live way up  In the clouds  Oh  You live in Cloud City  So me and my sweetheart  We turned all the lights off  And watched the thunderstorm  And lightning together  Well you can't watch thunderstorms  I understand  Yeah you can watch  The lightning and stuff  But now how did you watch it  Were you  Were you snuggling  Were you cuddling 
[01:47:30]  You know  Or sitting on opposite ends  Of the couch  I must say  That we had one of those moments  It was a  It was a nice moment  That's  That's very sweet  All our worries were  Were far away  You have no worries  You're rich  No worries  As we were watching  The lightning outside the window  No worries  I can't see  Like rich  As the person  That's like that  Like you probably  When you first got together  With Bonnie  Was there cuddling  Did you  Did you 
[01:48:00]  Did you get into bed  And like just  What's wrong with you guys  He mentions cuddling  And Rich goes  I was with this girl  He got no love as a child  I dated  Hold on Dr. Phil  I was dating  I'm not Dr. Phil  This is what a creep he is  His own wife said this  That he tried to comfort her  But he had to grab her breast  Bonnie said that  She was  She was being all affected to me once  And I was on my  I took my stylus  And I rubbed it up and down her arm 
[01:48:30]  But I'm not  Like I was with this girl  That I used to date  And she was really  Really beautiful  The girl in Vegas  No not that one  But this other girl  And I was sick  And I'm laying in bed  And she put her arm around me  And said what do you want  You know what can I do  I go one  Get your arm off of me  Because you know  You don't want to be touched  When you're sick  And you're laying there  You were either molested  Or you just got no love  You don't have to be a doctor  To see that  It's obvious  I wasn't molested  I wasn't molested  Well alright  Alright I mean  You know  You come from a broken home  You don't get the attention  That you're supposed to get

[02:02:30]  Thoughts  It's like when  Someone comes out  Of a coma  They've been there  For 25 years  You can't hold up  A mirror  Because oh my god  I have gray hair  I'm older  And he really  Thinks he's like  A college kid  I guess that's  I sure do  Jimmy  I sure do  Keeps him young  You're as young  As you feel  Right  Right  No you're as young  As your prostate  It's nice  It's a nice young  Haircut  I told him  I like the haircut  I just complimented you  Opie and I  Had a very gay moment  Walking  I told my girl  About the gay moment  Because you creeped me out  Because I was walking  With Jimmy to XM  And all of a sudden

[02:06:30]  Us  The weather is expected to stabilize back into the 80s today,  which is good for people who have to walk up and down.  And also known as those up-sea things. 
[02:07:00]  Danny, it's a brilliant writing.  What did Nurse Ratched do to you this morning?  Do you get it? He can't say S-T words.  In sports, Ken Griffey Jr. hit his staggering 600th home run earlier this week. 
[02:07:30]  Cincinnati Reds' hard player stared at the ball as he rounded the bases.  He laid us, us aided, and it felt like he floated around the bases and was not sure if he stepped on a single base. 
[02:08:00]  While his career played us, he played us for a while. 
[02:08:30]  He becomes only six players in history to reach 600.  And our big tech, us, us, us, us...  She's giving me anxiety.  Steve Jobs and Apple announced the new iPhone this week. 
[02:09:00]  Steve showed off many new features, including its 3G network,  which is higher than this handed 2G network. 
[02:09:30]  Plus, Steve also said that the new phones will cost as little as $199.  It will start selling in July. 
[02:10:00]  Many stores are expecting people to be standing outside lines waiting to buy the newest staple in technology.  Roger Clemens, who has been accused of stabbing himself with steroids. 
[02:10:30]  Steroids, Jesus.  I know we've been stamped with regular use of daily news. 
[02:11:00]  Our staff reported yesterday at the stadium.  He ejecuting himself to us, to us, to us, to our entire user, to use... 
[02:11:30]  The strengthening and drug enhance its performance on the field.  Clemens is stupidly trashed the pills and the gin and the vitamin bottles in his locker. 
[02:12:00]  The tomato along the handings table on hamburgers is a bean chicken. 
[02:12:30]  I walked the country due to an E coli, scared of F, T, A, issued a warning to consumers, to ups, pain, for certain piles of tomatoes.  The last time I saw a pair of jugs, that big two hillbillies were blowing on them.  Whip them out Wednesday. Get a wow sticker, get flashed, get happy.  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[02:13:00]  XM 202.  Good morning, everybody.  Hi.  Here we are, XM Satellite Radio.  Rich Voss has made the walk, and he's mad because he didn't get his last plug in.  I'm not mad at all.  I was debating that. I'm like, ah, man, Voss could use another plug, but just leaving Big A just kind of in the middle of stammering could be a good ending today, too. 
[02:13:30]  So I apologize.  What is it? The comedy what?  Comedy Cove in Springfield, New Jersey.  Comedy Cove.  But here's the thing, too. I don't want to look like I just come to plug. I don't care.  Shut up.  You know what I mean.  Just shut up.  You know what I mean.  Yeah.  You know what you mean.  I don't think people think you come just to plug.  There are people, it's very obvious, they're here because they're plugging something.  You're like a regular, man.  All right. Comedy Cove. 
[02:14:00]  Big A.  Yes, Opie.  Feeling better now?  Yeah, I'm feeling much better after having five hours of energy.  Five hours of energy.  Oh, five hours of energy.  Is that the competition for five-hour energy?  Sorry, five-hour energy.  That's what we should do.  Yeah.  Come up with our product.  Five hours of energy.  And then right after five hours, you just stop. 
[02:14:30]  Yeah.  Five-hour energy.  That's right.  What does it do for you there, Big A?  Keeps you energized.  Oh, yeah?  Four.  Five hours.  Can't you drink, answer a question within 40 seconds?  That drink?  What do you mean, Big?  I don't know.  What's the smell on this mic?  Do they spray these mics?  Probably some of the best.  No, they do spray them. 
[02:15:00]  Please talk about this video on the show.  The news will not touch this, and it's important.  Tell out of Iraq, Jimmy and Opie, this is why we're there.  Oh, boy.  Charlie Bean from Jersey.  Can you get this on the screen?  Charlie Bean?  Why are we there, Charlie Bean?  Charlie, call in.  We don't make us watch the video.  Just tell us.  Why are we there?  That's stupid.  To liberate the people.  That's great.  Oh, great.  Now Leslie Nielsen's boring everyone else out there. 
[02:15:30]  Who's that?  Jesus Christ.  Who's that, eh?  I don't know.  Still ahead in Nambla.  He was some guy that was waiting outside for the walkover.  Some people don't understand this.  And I, you know, how should everybody understand this?  But during the walkover, shut the fuck up.  That's pretty much my whole take on the walkover.  It's not a time to talk with fans and everybody else.  It's the time that we get to not talk. 
[02:16:00]  Because we're talking all fucking day.  So for the five minuscule minutes where we're dodging buses and taxi cabs.  Actually, Anthony, it's 14 or 15 minutes.  I've been keeping track.  They're starting later and later.  Every day.  I'm not going to acknowledge when they go after 11.  I'm only going to...  Holy shit. 
[02:16:30]  That's to a T.  Pauly, shut the fuck up.  But Ann makes a good point.  Is that angry typing guy?  Whether it's five or 14 minutes, it is time for us just to kind of get our heads together  for the second half of the show.  Even Marissa's turned on me.  What?  Sorry, Mr. Millionaire that doesn't want to be bothered to talk to people.  All right.  No, it's not that we don't...  Why don't you fucking type right instead of typing typos?  Face. 
[02:17:00]  Oh, face.  Jesus.  Nice spelling.  Anyway.  Where were we?  Where were we?  I'm just talking about how you know.  Oh, the guy.  Found a friend, Harry.  What was that guy talking about?  I don't know.  Something about a magazine in Boston a year ago.  And apparently he was in a picture in the background.  I wanted to know if I remembered.  And then I think Kenny shooed him away.  Shoot, shoot.  Kenny almost got hit by a bus today. 
[02:17:30]  He was just in the middle of the traffic.  I wish I got a picture.  These buses are very dangerous.  He's just standing on the double yellow line.  I'm like, Kenny, what are you doing?  There's traffic zooming both directions past Kenny.  Somehow he got stuck in the middle of 57th Street today.  He got stuck?  It's four lanes of traffic, right?  Two each way?  And he's just in the middle.  I'm stuck.  I'm trapped.  Help me.  Did he dart back and forth like a fucking squirrel and then get hit?  He just...  I would love to see that.  Dumb squirrel.  Runs right under your wheel. 
[02:18:00]  What is this?  An urgent communique?  What is it?  I'm going to go see Young Frankenstein today.  You are?  On Broadway.  Mel trying to come up with another winner, huh?  Yeah, I guess.  The producers and trying this one, huh?  I don't know why I'm doing this.  I think...  I don't know why.  Why the fuck am I doing this?  You ever all of a sudden find yourself doing something and you're like, why am I doing this? 
[02:18:30]  Yeah, it's called marriage.  Wow.  Goddamn, Rich.  You know, Rich, you've been making some hints.  You're not happy, are you?  I am very happy.  What's the problem with the marriage?  Is the kids getting in the way?  The kids getting all the suckling time?  What's going on with you and your marriage?  Bonnie's a lovely, beautiful woman.  And she's funny and she's smart.  But you already admitted today you don't like kissing her anymore.  No, I don't say I don't like kissing her.  I'm just not a, you know, big kisser right now.  Why? 
[02:19:00]  It's the kissing.  It's beyond that.  I'm very happy.  You know what it is?  Here's what I'm still...  What did you say?  Food pockets?  Yeah.  I'm still...  And this sounds...  And it's not...  I'm not trying to be selfish or self-centered because I love my daughter.  I'm still coming to grips with becoming a father at this age.  Because when your kids are turning 18, 17, you're thinking, oh, okay.  You know, I devoted my life to my daughters, you know, my other daughters.  And now I'm coming to grips with... 
[02:19:30]  I'm going to be raising a kid.  You have no my time.  You had like a little bit of me time.  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  Listen, now you've got another kid.  So I'm just trying to put it...  No, I do.  I play a lot of golf.  All right, listen.  But I feel selfish when I do stuff.  All right.  I don't care what you have to say because the video that this guy's turning us on to,  I can't watch it.  Sorry.  What is it?  Supposedly, it's a video of a young boy being beheaded.  Oh, I ain't watching that shit, you dumb motherfucker.  No, no.  He's doing the beheading.  The young boy is?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Show it.  I can't watch... 
[02:20:00]  I'm not even joking.  Don't watch it.  I'll look at it.  I'll watch it.  I can watch anything.  Who is he beheading?  A suspected spy?  Oh, Jesus.  No, I'm just making me...  Uh-oh.  Let's stop it.  It's fucking...  It's what's going on.  And why is this why we're over there?  What did the guys tell us?  Well, let's see.  All right.  I can't watch.  Ow!  Ow!  See?  Oh, God damn.  Why are all these people are savages?  We're...  Fucking savages. 
[02:20:30]  Dude, we're asked in interviews all the time, where's our line?  This is it for me.  I cannot...  Look at him chopping.  I'm not even watching.  Why?  And this is why we're over there?  I want to sleep at night.  I'm not watching this.  This isn't why we're over there.  I understand this is happening, but I'm not fucking watching.  If they want to do this to each other, who gives a flying fuck?  He's still slicing through, and he's taking the knife.  Of course he is.  He's hacking.  He's hacking now.  And he's hacking at the back of the head.  He's a little kid.  He has a hard time hacking through the...  And there's a guy trying to help him by pointing out with a stick where he's... 
[02:21:00]  Where's his face?  Where did the guy's face go?  They're holding it back with the beard.  They're holding it back.  He was kicking through.  Why, they still got to pin him down?  Jesus Christ.  Well, look at Pez Candy just came out of his neck.  Hey, you watching?  Oh, yeah.  Now I am.  And they're not...  It's not like they're...  Oh, that spine is hard to get through, isn't it?  But, dude, that's not why we're there.  The bottom line is...  It's hard to swallow.  Wow.  He needs a sucret.  He's dead now, I think.  Oh, God.  They're just butchering him.  And the thing is...  That's why they handle their problems.  That's why we're there. 
[02:21:30]  Because we're going to change religious fanaticism.  Like, kind of like when they kill those school children in Czechia.  Oh, they just twisted his head around the other way.  They got to get to the back.  But they're not beheading...  He's cutting through like a saw.  Yeah, what do you think it's like?  Fucking cartoon?  You know, just, you know...  Come on, you almost got it.  Come through with a machete or something.  There you go.  Just give it a tug.  It's awful.  Pull it already.  It's fucking awful.  That's not why we're there.  Watch your fingers now, kid.  Don't hurt yourself. 
[02:22:00]  That's Islamic extremism.  I still say get out of Iraq.  Because anyone that would do this, I have no desire to help.  Anyone whose culture in any way, shape, or form promotes this, I have no desire to fucking  help.  That's a kid doing it.  You think at this point the guy could be saved?  It's a fucking hour and a half.  Maybe they could sew it back.  Shouldn't you have to lift a certain amount of weight before you lop heads off?  Yeah.  This is still going on.  This kid stinks.  You must be at least this tall. 
[02:22:30]  Yeah, you must be at least this tall to chop off heads.  This kid sucks.  He is the worst.  Jesus Christ.  He's hacking.  I'm not looking, but I have to read this.  PC from Virginia writes, he did this with his My First Beheading playset.  Oh, there he goes.  All right.  Now he got it.  Yay.  Oh, now the guy's got that dopey, I've just been beheaded look on his face.  That poor fucking guy had a rough one, man.  Oh, look at that one.  Are they kicking the head around like a soccer ball now?  Nah, just a small child holding it up.  It's a wonderful group.  A wonderful group of human beings were trying to help over there. 
[02:23:00]  It's like a Halloween mask.  Yeah, doesn't it?  And then they put it on the back because that's what they do.  When did he die?  How long did it take him?  I don't know.  Oh, that took him in eight seconds.  When the head's coming off, the one guy will hold the beer and rips the head back so the  neck's very exposed.  And as they're slicing through, you can almost see the guy's trying to breathe.  Can we play like, I don't know, two girls, one cup to cleanse my palate?  How about, is it off the screen?  Yeah.  It's ridiculous. 
[02:23:30]  I swear to God, I just can't.  That's the first one you've seen, right, Ant?  I've seen a few.  I've seen a few.  I don't like when they do it.  I cannot watch.  Here's my line.  That's the first one I've ever seen.  Here's my line.  Let me tell you my line.  And it's completely based on fucking race.  When it's an American or a hostage, I can't fucking watch.  When another savage is fucking chopping off some other savage's head, I could give a flying  fuck.  I do not care.  Let him fucking do it all day long.  Just get our fucking guys out of there because that country isn't worth our time. 
[02:24:00]  It is not worth our fucking time.  Can we watch Hula Hoop Girl again, please?  Hula Hoop Girl.  Please.  Hula Hoop Girl.  Put up Hula Hoop Girl because that will cleanse the palate.  Hula Hoop Girl.  Is there any audio to this thing?  Tired of us having to help these stupid people.  Look at this.  This is good.  This is the hottest video.  Look at this, Rich.  She's playing Wii Fit.  Now, I got some info on this video. 
[02:24:30]  Do you?  Somebody wrote that this was put out by Nintendo.  No.  That sounds like.  As some of that viral marketing.  No.  You don't think so?  No.  All right.  Well, I'm just pulling whatever.  No.  You know why?  Because there's a rock band drum kit in the background and Nintendo probably wouldn't want  to promote someone else's product.  That's true.  Okay.  Hey, very good.  Look at her moving those hips.  I like the, as she bends over to get another hula hoop around her body. 
[02:25:00]  Her, well, her virtual body.  That's amazing for a white girl.  She's sexy, right?  We don't even know if she's sexy.  That's the beauty of this.  How she moves is extremely sexy, but we don't know what her face looks like.  She's got a big shirt on.  But you can see the panties.  And then, and then the dude has to wreck the fucking video.  And then douchebags got to come in there.  We get it.  Well, he should be beheaded. 
[02:25:30]  I'd be like I didn't even get a fair trial.  Hold on.  Let's go to, let's go to the phones.  Chris in Jersey.  What's up?  Hey, Vaj.  You were going to love that beheading video.  One hack to another, huh?  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  I believe that young gentleman from Iraq actually works for a subdivision of the Susquehanna  Head Removal Company.  No, that's funny, man. 
[02:26:00]  Good job.  All right.  They continue.  I love this one.  What?  Ew.  It's the same video?  What the?  Ew.  What is it?  Some mom trying to.  It's mommy.  It's somebody's mom.  With her mom ass?  Her mom ass and her mom pants and her two little kids doing the same exact video.  Yeah, but that's Timmy and Jamie.  They do the dance with their mother.  Oh, really?  Yeah, I taught them how to do the hula for the Wii. 
[02:26:30]  I'm flocking the kids.  Let them get some camera time.  Hey, Tank Rizzo is standing by what he wrote me earlier from Off Topic.  Can you get this?  That's the story where they're saying Nintendo did pay them to do this.  Like I said, go to that link and let's see what they say.  But there's mommy doing the same.  Oh, God.  Same video.  Oh, did Nintendo like say make your own YouTube Wii fucking fitness thing?  And we'll, I don't know.  And we'll put it on.  Yeah, I don't know. 
[02:27:00]  Whatever the fuck.  But while that girl wins.  What do you have on this, Danny?  I can't.  I can't.  I can't.  Well, I had to stop the other one.  Yeah, I understand.  Yeah.  Didn't want to do that, though.  What does that say, Jimmy?  I can't.  My eyes suck.  It says on Nintendo Wii Workout Hot Girl Fim.  I noticed today on the Dig Most Dugged story that there was why she tried to buy your girlfriend  a Wii Workout.  Wait.  Why you should buy your girlfriend a Wii Workout, which has a thumbnail of some girl in her underwear  and a video symbol.  For research purposes, I followed and watched. 
[02:27:30]  Pretty good.  I could see.  Oh, it's called something.  Say that to you.  I don't know.  It's just, I don't know what it is.  I'm not helping.  I don't know.  I'm not helping.  We should have Big A do the hula hoop video.  Would you like to?  Big A actually is here to sing a song or two for us. 
[02:28:00]  Yes.  I saw Bret Michaels on the WB this morning.  What was he doing?  Our pal Bret Michaels.  He better get his ass in here tomorrow.  I guess we're trying to get Bret Michaels in.  And we thought it might be fun to hear Big A singing Every Rose Has Its Thorn.  Ah.  You want to do that now?  I would love to.  Big A, are you ready to do a little singing for us?  Classic 80s power ballad.  Yes, of course.  Bill Burr, Bill Burr wrote and he said that we should get Big A to sing the rain song. 
[02:28:30]  That made Bill Burr laugh really hard inside.  So I don't know if Big A could get through the rain song.  Basically, we're looking for very emotional songs that Big A could.  What's this?  No, I was trying to do some research.  Oh, okay.  Oh.  That was the hula hoop girl again.  God bless the wee fish.  Oh, that stupid beheading video made me queasy.  Really?  I made my...  Makes me queasy.  I could eat fucking tomato soup while watching this.  Oh, God. 
[02:29:00]  Tomato soup with beard hair in it.  That's true.  It really made you queasy?  Yeah, it did.  I just can't go into it.  It is...  The worst part of it...  It's the first few slices through the neck because you still see the human being alive.  Yeah.  After a while, your mind just shuts down to it.  And it's just butchering something?  Yeah, it's just butchering something.  Yeah, it doesn't matter.  Ugh.  So gross.  Fucking people.  Google Lauren Burnett.  B-E-R-N-A-T. 
[02:29:30]  You will get a picture of the hula girl.  Well, let's see if she looks hot because you can only see her on a side view.  Why?  How do people know her name?  I think it's part of the...  Yeah, see?  It's Lauren Burnett.  Oh, isn't it?  Well, because everyone's trying to figure out who this girl is.  I'm telling you, this video is huge right now online.  Danny!  He's getting there.  Let's see what she looks like.  I just like yelling at the people that are doing the computer.  It's fun.  Images.  Images.  Images.  Where is she? 
[02:30:00]  This kid...  Because the whole controversy is that I guess the guy in the video works for an advertising  agency, so because he put the video up...  Oh.  They're saying...  They're trying to say that Nintendo hired this company to virally promote We Fit.  Job well done.  No kidding.  Where is the...  An image?  This doesn't want to load for some reason.  I don't want to load.  Can't you just put her in Images and Google Images?  Is...  Well, where the hell is she? 
[02:30:30]  Is...  Is...  I don't know.  I don't know.  And then...  But they're kind of feedback saying just Google it, right?  Yeah.  Well, there's a million...  Yeah.  Bernatts or whatever her name is out there, so...  You want Big A to do Every Rose Has Its Thorn or Open Arms?  Oh, wow.  Some Journey.  Open Arms is a nice one, man.  I think some Journey would be better.  How about we start with Every Rose and then go Open Arms?  Maybe we do a little...  A little of each?  Well, hold on.  Which one moves you more, Andrew?  Nothing moves me. 
[02:31:00]  A forklift.  Oh, that's me.  Big A, I wouldn't do that to you ever.  Ever.  Every Rose.  All right.  You want to try Every Rose?  Are you comfortable, Big A?  Put your headphones on.  We got the music and everything.  You know when to come in?  Someone's suggesting that he sing Stairway to Heaven.  Jason and Stanford.  I'm buying a...  The upsy things to heaven. 
[02:31:30]  The upsy things to heaven.  That was very funny.  Upsy.  Huh?  Danny and Travis wrote Big A's News today.  They do a very good job squeezing in those ST words.  You ready, Big A?  Yes.  All right.  Here we go.  Big A's rendition of Every Rose Has Its Thorn.  Was that it? 
[02:32:00]  I think that was his cue.  I always get confused which song starts.  I think that was his cue.  I think that was the one, huh?  You could just feel it when it comes around.  Right.  All right.  Don't tell him where it is.  Let's see if he can find it himself.  Find where the song starts, Big A.  You can do this.  You can do this.  We both lie. 
[02:32:30]  And three, and go.  We both lie.  This is family still in the dead of the night.  Although we both lie close together.  We still miles apart inside. 
[02:33:00]  Was it something I said or something I did?  It's something I did?  It's something I did.  It's something I did.  It's something I did.  Oops.  It is like it's dark.  What, Big A?  What's wrong?  I don't know.  You're losing your mind over there.  What's wrong?  Talk to us. 
[02:33:30]  No, I thought I was going to get the original words in my headset.  That's what threw me off.  Oh.  Oh, you wanted to sing along to like the vocals.  You wanted a little vocal cue.  Yeah, to help me where the pauses are and when I should begin.  Well, we could do where you hear the music and no one else hears it.  You want to try that?  How do we do that? 
[02:34:00]  How could you possibly keep up with it?  I want him to hear the music but no one else in his headphones.  Oh, boombox time.  Sure.  You want to try this again, though?  Yes, please.  All right.  Big A, everyone.  Every rose has its thorn.  Yeah.  Sure.  Come on.  Thank you.  Oh, wow. 
[02:34:30]  Holy mother of pearl.  Big A, what's going on? 
[02:35:00]  You're getting a little confused.  Look at me.  What happened?  What happened there, Big A?  Did someone just yell he needs a bouncing ball?  Oh, right.  Follow the bouncing ball.  Yeah.  Yeah, he doesn't know where all the pauses are.  And how about you at least give him the cue to start so we can at least get something. 
[02:35:30]  All right.  Ant's really good at this stuff.  Let's see if we can...  Watch Ant.  He really will point.  Get ready, Big A.  You got to be quick.  So you see Ant.  Ready?  And ready.  Go.  We both fly silently still.  It's the day of the night. 
[02:36:00]  Yeah.  So we both fly closely together.  We feel miles apart inside.  Was it something I said?  Something I did?  Did my words not come out right?  No, I tried not to hurt you.  How about we try Journey?  Maybe we'll try Journey and see how that works. 
[02:36:30]  Someone's suggesting he does My Generation.  Talking about my generation.  You got Open Arms by Journey?  Yes.  This is a good love song.  We were all getting mushy today on the show, so this is perfect.  You ready?  You ready?  Journey.  Open Arms by Big A.

Because you do the same thing  I know  But at least I do it  In a funny way  It's too bad  You tell them, Rich  It's too bad  Because the boards  Are giving these guys  Way too much power  It's too bad  That's why we always say  Just squish these fuckers  Well, when Anthony  Started going out with Jill  Immediately  It was like  I don't like the way  Her fucking implants look  Yeah  Yeah  Let her down easy

[03:01:00]  For calling the show  Always a pleasure  I guess  Finding time  From his very busy  Hollywood day  To call the Opie and Anthony show  He's been popping up  On a lot of stuff  I'm just looking at you Rich  That's all.  Oh, geez.  That's all.  Big A, you want to do one more?  Okay.  Big A.  Well, we were ready to put this to bed for today, but I noticed that we have a karaoke  version of the official song of Antholini. 
[03:01:30]  Oh, geez.  And I think it would be an honor if Big A sang Amazed by Lone Star for Anthony and his  lovely girlfriend.  Joe, do you have another song?  We do.  Just a few.  Are you willing to admit another one?  No.  Of course not.  No.  It's just a few that suit various moments in our long relationship that we've had.  You know, yesterday was our three-week anniversary. 
[03:02:00]  I was like, it seems just like so recently that it was only two weeks.  You were about to say it seems like a week.  A week ago.  You didn't think it would be funny that way.  Not from this end.  It seems like ten years.  See?  Yeah, I'm with you, Jimmy.  What'd you do for your three-week anniversary?  We napped.  Oh, boy.  See, it's already fallen off the relationship.  No, no.  I think we came to the conclusion that last night was the first night we didn't drink.  It took my three weeks. 
[03:02:30]  And then she looked at you and went, do we even like each other?  I don't know.  We've never talked.  Right.  Who are you?  I'm Anthony.  Hi, I'm Jill.  What am I doing here?  I'm going to grab my stuff and leave.  Days of Wine and Delusions.  Come on.  Wine and what?  Delusion.  Delusion.  Delusions.  Oh, it's a...  Why do you always mention fucking movies that are over 50 years old?  I know.  It's one of the best movies ever.  It was a right movie.  It was a great movie.  Days of Wine and Roses.  It was a great movie for back...  It was a great movie.  Just say for back then. 
[03:03:00]  Thumbs up or thumbs down?  Don Rickles.  Great.  You mean as a comic?  Yeah.  No, as a fucking philanthropist.  Great.  I told you.  I saw him in live, man.  I want to see him live.  Even though he's 80, 81 years old.  I saw him in 1979 or 80 or 70 at the Fountain or Latin Casino in Cherry Hill, New Jersey.  He was just amazing.  What was the occasion?  Your 40th birthday party?  Oh, boy.  You're on fire.  And you're doing it so nonchalantly as you're opening a CD disc like it's just natural. 
[03:03:30]  I'm feeling comfortable.  Yeah.  I'm feeling comfortable with smashing you.  It was very funny.  I was going to go with 50 and 50 would have got the laugh, I'm thinking.  All right.  Big A.  Lone Star.  Amazed?  I'll be 51 this month.  What bone are you going to break on me this year?  Oh, boy.  Did your elbow heal?  No.  And I still have the doctor bills at home.  I keep them on my bulletin board.  Of course you do. 
[03:04:00]  What was the official injury?  A fractured elbow.  Fractured elbow?  Wow.  Wow, you're old.  Oh, my God.  I'm old.  I know.  Hips and elbows.  That's what goes when you get older.  All right.  You did fall down good, though, man.  I didn't push you.  I know.  Who was it that got excited?  It was Bob who else?  Robert Kelly, right?  Like a fucking, just a big rhino.  He ran in circles going brrrr.  You blame me, but Bob Kelly got excited  pushing that cake into your face  during the Devour show. 
[03:04:30]  Oh, listen to me.  Did you fart, too, Jimmy?  It's the thing.  People put their tongues in there.  And dicks.  I know.  You're joking, stupid.  Yeah, but you didn't even wait for a pause.  You didn't want anyone to get in there.  I didn't see that one.  Right.  People put their tongues in there.  Fucking eight guys in a room.  Jimmy's asshole looks like an opera singer.  It is.  It looked like a boarded-up wind tunnel. 
[03:05:00]  Nothing.  Why?  I don't know.  I just threw it out.  What are you talking about?  I don't know.  It just was gray.  Ugh.  My asshole was fucking clean and delicious.  Yeah, it was gray.  It was just off-colored.  We could say it now.  There was a moment that we couldn't really get into  on the other side  when we all dropped our pants  to show off our underwear.  Yeah.  And then Rich decided to go too far  and not only bend over to Anthony this time, right?  Yeah, yeah.  And then you spread your cheeks  to show your asshole.  I turned away just in time. 
[03:05:30]  And then after that,  all of a sudden you're gagging and stuff  because you're smelling something in the room.  Like, idiot, that's your own asshole you're smelling.  That was the only reason  why there was a bad smell in the fucking studio.  No, I wasn't gagging at that.  Yes, you were.  I listened to the replay.  That's not why I was gagging.  I was gagging because  Big A took down his pants  and I looked at him  and I just started gagging.  Jesus.  What kind of fucking way is that  to talk about Big A?  You're going to take that, Big A?  What's wrong?  You know.  Oh, I didn't know he was still in the room.  Why would you say that, buddy?  He's a great guy.  He's right there.  Big A?  Who? 
[03:06:00]  Listen, I was coming.  Andrew?  So mean.  Yeah, Rich.  I don't know why he has to be so mean.  I come out  and support your comedy gigs all the time.  Oh, man.  He's right there.  He's right there.  Andrew's a sweet guy.  You're right.  He's at probably every show you do.  You know what?  Hold the mic, Andrew.  You know what?  I have to apologize  because that was me.  And I was gagging on my own smell  and I just tried to...  What is that?  What type of...  Would that bother you 
[03:06:30]  when he talks like that about you?  For real?  Yes.  Really?  Who the fuck wants to be talked about  like this?  That's true.  Really?  What the fuck?  Come on, Rich.  Did I compliment you  when you first walked in  and how good you looked?  Did I...  Who was the one  who complimented you first?  You did.  Yeah, but we didn't compliment him  but then we don't set out  to humiliate him either.  Really?  Yeah, and we don't give him  fake compliments.  No, I did.  I said he looked good.  That wasn't a fake compliment.  Oh, no.  It was very genuine  coming from you  and then all of a sudden  he smells  and he's making you gag.  No, I didn't say  he smelled at all. 
[03:07:00]  What did you say?  Andrew, please.  What did he say?  Yeah.  Well, I apologize on the air.  That you gagged  because of me.  When I drop my pad,  you gagged.  I'm sorry.  Don't I shake your hand  and not run in the bathroom  and wash it?  Oh, God.  Well, great.  You guys got something going on.  Can I...  I want to make a request today.  Could someone, like,  transcribe the John Candy lines  from Planes, Trains, and Automobiles?  I've got to hear Big A say it. 
[03:07:30]  Especially after Rich  smashing him like that.  Go ahead.  What is it?  Go ahead.  Hurt me if you...  Go on.  Hurt me if you want.  I'm an easy target.  Big Del Griffith.  Yeah.  Could we get some Del Griffith lines  from Planes, Trains, and Automobiles?  The classic speech of, you know,  people making fun of him.  Go ahead.  And thank you for coming out.  I'm sorry.  Next...  You know what?  Next time,  I'll let you in for you again.  Okay?  Okay.  You support well,  and thank you.  And I apologize.  No, I don't.  Now get my fucking sign box. 
[03:08:00]  Oh!  Right away,  you're getting fucking fresh.  All right.  We're going to try to find some Del Griffith.  All right.  Big A, you ready for Lone Star?  This is the official song of Mansellini,  so you've got to do a good job with this.  Yes, there, Dave.  Now, Big A did request that he gets the original version of this  because he doesn't know it very well,  so I think that's just all the more reason to play the character version.  Oh, of course.  Anthony will know if he's doing it right.  Oh, I will.  Well, you've heard it a few times.  I said I will.  Oh, okay.  Not even busting on you.  Of course. 
[03:08:30]  Here we go.  Big A.  Uh-oh.  Raising your hand.  What happened?  Oh, oh, oh.  Yeah, yeah.  There's no hand raising.  You can't what?  What happened over there?  I can't hear anything in the...  Brain tumor?  I said it all.  Not even the musical.  What happened?  I think his battery has died.  Oh, your battery died.  Your battery, it's dying.  Oh, okay.  All right.  We're getting you a new headset.  This is called improv as we...  Did you just shush Ope? 
[03:09:00]  Yes.  Oh, boy, Big A.  No, I did not.  Hey, shushed the host.  Rich Voss dropped his...  Oh, sorry.  Hold on.  Let's see if Big A, is it okay if Ope talks on the Andrew and Anthony show?  Maybe Ope should raise his hand and you can just kind of point and he'll...  Oh, Jimmy.  No, that's fine.  Oh, shh.  No, no.  Hey, shut up.  I'm listening to something.  Oh, all right.  No, it's about Andrew.  He fucking belts out a couple of tunes. 
[03:09:30]  Hey, Voss, don't make fun of me.  Ope, shut your fucking face.  Hey, get up.  I'll talk, Jim.  What are you writing?  What the fuck?  No, Jimmy.  That wasn't it.  My apologies.  I didn't realize we were stepping on your toes.  Yeah.  All right.  Sorry, the big singer has something to say.  Go ahead.  Yeah.  Go ahead.  The crooner would like to speak, so my apologies.  The crooner.  Oh, yeah.  I like me.  My wife likes me.  Yeah, that's got to be in it. 
[03:10:00]  Oh, we want the whole speech about his wife being dead.  Just get the freaking lines.  I haven't been home in years.  Yeah.  The movie makes me laugh hard.  He's so pathetic.  It's hilarious.  Big A.  I forgot what I was going to tell you.  Oh, really fast.  Rich Voss, during the break, dropped his designer sunglasses in the toilet.  In the turlet.  Oh, you did?  Yeah.  And they were actually in a smarter place than they were with an artist's face.  He actually jumped.  Like, we can't take all these stupid thoughts behind us. 
[03:10:30]  That log looks brighter.  Yeah.  Ooh, finally brain cells.  All right.  Big A, you ready?  Lone Star.  Amazed.  Lone Star.  Go.  Every time.  Oh, Jesus.  What happened, Ant?  He came in a little late. 
[03:11:00]  A little late?  Yeah.  You knew where to come in.  You should be able to feel where to come in.  Yeah, feel it, Big A.  You know?  Feel the love.  Uh-huh.  What the hell is going on now?  What the hell is going on?  Anthony, I'm sorry.  I don't listen to this music all the time.  Well, are you implying that I do?  Yeah, now Ops should shut up and Ed should change his iPod.  I listen to too much of this kind of music, I guess, or something.  What else is wrong with us?  Geez, Big A.  Big A stands for attitude. 
[03:11:30]  Yeah, holy shit.  Here, let's try it again.  Go.  Every time our eyes meet, this feeling inside me is almost more than I can take.  Baby.  To bed, the eyes he's talking about are on the nightstand.  I can feel how much you love me, and it just blows me away. 
[03:12:00]  Well, they're always open because it's an inflatable doll.  I've never been this close to anyone or anything.  I can hear your thoughts.  I can see your dreams.  I don't know how.  I'm so in love with you. 
[03:12:30]  It just keeps getting better.  I want to spend the rest of my life with you inside forever and ever.  And every little thing that you do, they'd be amazed by you. 
[03:13:00]  Haunting.  Definitely.  Haunting.  Literally haunting.  This is going to haunt my nightmare.  The smell of your skin.  The taste of your kiss.  Breath.  The way you whisper in the dark.  I'm going to kill you.  Baby, you surround me.  Is your body parts all over the room?  You touch every place in my heart.  She surrounds her.  Her leg's over there. 
[03:13:30]  Her hand's over there.  It feels like the first time.  Every time.  I want to spend the whole night in your eyes.  And standing in your guts.  I don't know how to do this.  What you do.  I'm so in love with you.  It just keeps getting better.  I want to spend the rest of my life behind bars being examined. 
[03:14:00]  So I'm sorry, I ate your face.  I will ever and ever.  And it was delicious.  The very little thing that you do.  Baby, I'm amazed by you.  I'm amazed by you. 
[03:14:30]  The little thing that you do.  I'm so in love with you.  Put a knife in you.  And it keeps getting better.  I want to spend the rest of my life.  I want to spend the rest of my life.  Make you find my son.  You're my dead wife.  Forever and ever.  He's making you my dead wife.  Every one thing that you do. 
[03:15:00]  And you say, baby, I'm amazed by you.  Him and Kenny should do a duet.  All right.  Big A.  Big A.  Big A.  Big A.  Oh, who's that?  What a creep. 
[03:15:30]  My dead wife.  Rich.  That's pretty good, man.  So we did Open Arms.  We did Every Rose.  We have Stay I Missed You by Lisa Loeb.  And Stand By Me and More Than Words.  Anyone feeling any of those?  Wow.  What, the Berlin song, No More Words?  Extreme.  Oh, extreme.  More than words.  More than words.  More than words.  More than words.  Oh.  Bill Burr suggested that he does the Rain song. 
[03:16:00]  That's the one.  That gets a bit emotional.  I think he should do the divorce song by Sonny and Cher.  Well, I have to go now.  So kiss me.  It's where they're getting divorced and their dad's leaving.  It's really fucking.  Oh, that's the one that makes you cry.  Yeah.  Does it, Rich?  What makes you cry?  You don't remember this story?  Oh, I told this story.  Yeah.  What makes you cry?  What is it?  It's a Sonny and Cher song.  I guess they sang about divorce.  Yeah, when we were kids. 
[03:16:30]  Rich comes from a broken family.  It used to make them cry.  And what?  Daddy used to play it on the way to mommy's house?  No.  No.  When it came on the radio in our old car, me and my sister would just start crying.  Can we please get this fucking song?  What's the name of the song?  Do you know?  It's Kiss Me Goodbye, I think, by Cher.  Cher?  I don't remember this one.  Oh, this is.  Yeah.  I think it's.  Oh, I have to go, kids.  What are you doing?  Jesus.  What are you doing? 
[03:17:00]  What are you doing, Rich?  Are you eating it?  Barfka.  It's a great.  It's really such a sad song.  You don't have it?  We don't have it on our.  Do we have it?  It's not the right title.  We probably have it.  If it was on the radio, we got to have it.  Check YouTube or some shit.  We must have that motherfucker.  Yeah, we'll find it.  What's it called, Richard?  Uh, you better sit down, kids. 
[03:17:30]  Why are your eyes getting so big?  I think that's it.  You better sit down, kids.  If Rich starts crying.  Oh, he found it.  Very good.  E-Rex got it.  Tell us what part made you cry.  Well, we'll just.  Let's see if we can figure it out.  All right.  This is.  You better sit down, kids.  Buy Sonny and Cher or just Cher?  Just Cher?  All right.  This used to make Rich and his sister cry as kids.  You better sit down, kids. 
[03:18:00]  I'll tell you why, kids.  I'll just look at Rich.  I know.  You might not understand, kids.  But give it a try, kids.  That's Cher.  Now, how should I put this?  Your father skied into a tree.  I have something to say.  Quit like you, pussy, kid.  But I'm going away.  Oh, boy.  No, we're not mad, kids. 
[03:18:30]  Oh, that's.  And it's hard to say why.  Your mother and I, kids.  Oh, that's Sonny.  What the fuck are those?  Don't see eye to eye.  Say your prayers before you go to bed.  Make sure you get yourself a school on time.  I know you do the things your mother asks.  You're going to need your mother to stay in line.  Thanks. 
[03:19:00]  Keep in mind, your mother's going to need your help.  This stinks.  I didn't say it was a rock and roll fucking song.  I didn't say we.  Wait, Vox is getting sad.  Yeah, he was getting sad.  Get the lyrics printed out.  You're getting tearyotics.  No, I'm not.  It just brings back horrible memories.  There's this glistening.  No, I didn't know it was eye cuffs.  You just wiped your eye cuffs.  Oh, Rick.  You wiped your eye.  He's a little Richie Voss right now.  He's gone back to her.  He's a little Richie Voss.  Take the lyrics printed out.  Get over it.  You're 51 years old. 
[03:19:30]  I'm over it.  What do you mean?  Give me a shit what happened to mommy and daddy at this point.  I don't give a shit.  Apparently you do.  Wait, get them for Rich.  Can we print them out?  I want to see them out.  I can't understand what she's saying.  Put this up a little bit so Rich can hear it.  Don't look so sad.  C.W. from Scranton is suggesting that Big A sings Edmund Fitzgerald.  That'll kill time until noon.  Just remember I love you.  Oh, this is sad. 
[03:20:00]  Where's mommy going?  No, I'm not here.  Just call if you need me.  Yeah, just call.  I'll be sucking on Greg Auman's cock.  No.  Poor Rich.  Make sure you get yourself to school.  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  Hey, let's move on.  Oh, what's the matter?  We're just all looking at you. 
[03:20:30]  What's the matter, Rich?  It's just to go down to the side of your face.  Hey, I know we're trying not to do overkill shit, but someone is suggesting that Big A sings one of these heart-wrenching love songs as we play women screaming.  Do we have some good screamy clips?  I just have the basic...  Which one you got?  Well, for...  Let's see if we even...  For the people that can remember, all I have is the... 
[03:21:00]  Come on!  Play the clip of your girl waking up sober with you.  That's funny.  Oh, my God, Rich.  That's hilarious that she cries and screams.  Yeah, it's popcorn.  I didn't find humor in that.  I got orgasms.  I got...  We don't have any good screaming?  I only have that one I use for Lycus' wife being thrown in the fireplace. 
[03:21:30]  I never understood those papers.  Which one?  Which one?  What, the C. Dick run book?  No, but just how...  Like, why does that paper...  And then you put the other one on, it's a different voice.  Because, see, that says seven?  Yeah.  I hit bank select, seven, and now it's set up for seven.  So, if I want nine, I put nine there.  So, you can only have ten things.  I go bank select, nine.  But then that means you can only have ten different sounds.  Oh, no.  No, it means you can have 50 pages of fucking 50 sounds. 
[03:22:00]  Oh, I see what he's saying.  No, you don't.  It's dumb.  God, are you a dolt?  I love it.  What, what, what, Jimmy?  I just...  Oh, no.  What happened?  That one's famous.  It's in every TV show trailer.  It's just like...  What happened?  I think Danny is...  Drinking.  Because he brought up the lyrics.  Drinking.  He's printing them.  But we have all these guys here.  Why did somebody else not do that?  Yes!  I don't know.  Why does he have to do it when he's sitting in here with us?  Like, he brought it up. 
[03:22:30]  Why can't I ask that to be printed out?  I don't know.  The guy sitting there should always be sitting there.  Exactly.  Like, what?  You never see fucking, you know, Captain Kirk.  Where's Steve?  Yopi would be Captain Kirk sitting there.  Where's Steve?  I'm a Spock.  How come you had to do that in one of those guys?  I don't know.  I would love to answer that.  And Sulu just left.  Can I ask why nobody else...  He's a faggot.  Here's Steve.  He's in a rest area.  Yeah.  Here's Steve.  Here's Steve.  Hello.  Is anybody...  Danny is sitting here behind the thing.  I just printed out the lyrics for you that you asked for after finishing up the other 
[03:23:00]  conversation I was having while Travis is listening to audio back there.  Okay.  What everybody else is doing, but if the other conversation was like, if we're on the air,  I'm only saying, like, how come nobody else did it?  And Danny has to leave the studio to do it.  Here's a question.  Are we working on John Candy?  Yes, we are.  That's going on in the back, too.  All right.  All right.  I don't mean that if I bark, everyone should jump.  I just mean, like, for timing issues.  I do.  I understand you.  I don't think Danny should have to leave.  The second I was aware that this had to get done because there were...  There's fucking guys in there.  There's guys in there.  Yeah, believe me.  We have 20 guys behind the scenes.  Believe me.  People better start fucking listening or there will be eight seven guys working here. 
[03:23:30]  Oh, shit.  There's not going to be a guy.  Oh, shit.  There's a brown Audi parked in my parking spot.  For a while, I was real friendly to these guys, and it didn't get me fucking anywhere.  Dude, no one's been dumb since AAF.  When were you friendly?  We don't know how to fire anyone.  When was Steve ever friendly?  Yeah, unfortunately.  Well, you know.  Oh, shit.  For too long.  Why?  If you want him to leave, just pretend they're in a failure.  It's a transcribe, though, Danny.  Oh, shit.  We need to transcribe so Big A can do it. 
[03:24:00]  We're going to have Big A do this, but we're looking for...  We got transcribers.  I should have made wet.  I should have made wet before.  I have to make wet.  Ew.  I want Rich...  Can we have Rich read this?  Wee-wee.  I would like to hear...  Listen...  What happened, Danny?  What happened?  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  Now what's going on?  I can't stand without my glasses.  Ah, shit.  No, nothing.  Nothing.  I asked...  You asked if it was transcribed, so I asked the intern.  He's like, oh, no.  He's like, I thought you just wanted the audio.  Oh, give him a beat.  Give him a beat down.  It's okay.  He'll transcribe. 
[03:24:30]  Intern beat down.  From Plain's Trains.  It's fine.  We'll get it.  Can we have...  Can we have a tree?  I would like to hear you read these.  I don't know if I can without glasses.  If you can, but without education.  Let's turn this into some kind of, like, poetry reading.  We got any music we can play for this?  Can somebody out there print this a little bit bigger, please?  Just because Rich doesn't have shitty eyes.  Okay.  What's that?  Somebody out there.  Let them do it.  Just...  What?  Rich, this is a big font.  Go ahead.  I can see it.  I can see it.  Yeah, can you?  Hold on. 
[03:25:00]  What are you reading this fucking email for?  We're on the air.  What are you doing?  Because Bonnie's trying to drive into New York for her first time, and I'm scared if  she's in New York.  What?  Is she really?  Yeah.  Wow.  Four years we've been driving in together, and she still doesn't know how.  Oh, you're finally letting her do things on her own.  Oh, yeah.  Why hasn't she driven into New York yet?  She's scared to.  She's been here long enough.  She's scared to drive into New York City.  Yes.  Oh.  She's a farm girl.  Is she?  So what does this song remind you of?  This reminds you of when you were how old? 
[03:25:30]  When I was in second grade.  Okay.  Oh, that's much better.  When I was in second grade.  Did he have that over angrily?  No, that was cool.  It helped.  It helped.  It was just two pages, man.  This is like...  There's honey on it.  It's like a script.  All right.  You were in second grade.  I think it was second...  And who had left?  My father.  He moved out.  When was the last time you had a script with two pages?  Oh.  That's pretty funny for me.  That's good.  I just got a part of the movie recently.  Big A laughed. 
[03:26:00]  See?  So...  You were in second grade.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think it was second.  You were second.  Well, my mother walked out.  My father left.  Okay.  Your dad walked out.  And then your mom...  Well, he didn't walk out.  They didn't get along.  Your mom would take you where?  And your sister would cry when this came on.  It didn't matter where she was taking us.  We were in the car and a song came on.  Okay.  You know, on the radio.  It was a big hit at the time.  Because I never heard this song.  Read the words to it.  Because you weren't born.  Okay.  Fine.  No.  I mean...  We've all checked out oldies radio over the years. 
[03:26:30]  Here and there.  Yeah.  I'd never heard this song before.  We got some poetry music for Rich.  For the reading of the lyrics that used to make him cry as a kid.  What are you putting in your eye?  Uh, cum.  I thought I was going to get that.  It's dripping down your face.  It's eye drops.  I tilt my head back.  You got things on your nose.  Eye drops.  You're just a falling...  You're falling apart.  What could it be in my eyes?  What do you think it is?  It's a new sand concoction.  When your eyes are dry, I put sand on them. 
[03:27:00]  What do you think it is?  I knew what it was.  How would you not just deduce there were eye drops of some sort?  There's nothing else people put in their eyes like that.  I could see if I was throwing up a rubber ball and catching it on my eye.  You really can't go anywhere with what Jimmy was doing.  Oh, God.  That's so funny.  Let's move on.  He was putting drops of acid in his eye.  If I was dipping my fist in it and punching my open eye, then he might go, what are you  doing in your eye?  It's a little teeny eye dropper thing. 
[03:27:30]  And my head's back.  I'm opening my eyes with my thumb and pointer finger.  And with my other middle finger and thumb, I'm dripping liquid into my eyes.  Yeah.  So there's no common sense there.  He looks at me the way a fucking German shepherd would look at me.  Like, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Just human head back lit water.  Blah, blah, blah, blah.  Jesus, your fucking reasoning skills need a lot of improvement, Richard. 
[03:28:00]  Not much deducing going on.  Richard.  Awful.  That's what they used to call me, Richard, when I was young, when I used to hear the song.  But you used to cry like a baby.  It's not a baby.  It's just...  Well, Richard, who said?  He was very sad.  At second grade, you know, your dad getting divorced?  That's kind of fucking depressing, isn't it?  I was a big crybaby, too.  You were?  Well, that's because your dad made you guys shower together.  No.  I would cry if I had to wash my father's back, too.  I cried tears of joy, hoping my hog would be as big as dear old dad's.  That's right.  So whose fault was the divorce? 
[03:28:30]  The breakup?  Daddy or Mommy?  You're drooling!  Holy shit!  I didn't...  Did you just drooling?  It was like a German Shepard.  It wasn't even...  Little!  It was like that fucking movie with fucking Tom Hanks or what the hell?  Beethoven?  All right, sure.  Let's go with Beethoven.  Hey, fucking Hooch.  Hooch.  Hooch, thank you.  I'm alien.  Dude, holy shit.  I've never seen a drool like that in my life. 
[03:29:00]  Exactly.  His little teeth come back.  Wow.  Holy shit.  You ought to just walk around with a portable dental sucker and then it goes onto your back.  All right, we're getting on track.  All right.  Yeah.  I want to know about this.  Wait, everyone is saying that we missed a line you had about us losing our affiliates?  I don't know.  It was a joke I did back then.  People said it was hilarious and we all missed it.  It went right over our heads.  All right, go ahead. 
[03:29:30]  Rich, what music do we have?  Maybe the Hulk music?  We're just going to do a little poetry or something.  I don't know.  What do you got?  Let's see what you got.  Oh, you want me to start reading now?  All right.  I thought you were going to...  First of all, first of all.  Hold on.  First of all, Bull, listen to me.  What is a fucking Charles Barkley fucking deodorant commercial?  It fucking stinks.  You got to play sad music like the Hulk.  All right, let's do Hulk.  Yeah, I think Jimmy's right.  The fucking classical music.  I think Ant's got the Hulk music.  Let's try that.  Hulk walking away music.  You're walking away from your... 
[03:30:00]  I asked for sad music.  It's the fucking theory.  Whatever that would be.  Sad music should be the opener for this show.  Now that would have been fun.  Here we go.  Okay, ready?  Better sit down, kids.  I'll tell you why.  Kids, you might not understand.  Kids, but give it a try.  Kids, now how should I put this?  I've got something to say.  Your mother is staying, but I'm going away. 
[03:30:30]  No, we're not mad, kids.  It's hard to say why.  Your mother and I don't see eye to eye.  Say your prayers before you go to bed.  Make sure you get yourself to school on time.  I know you'll do the things your mother asks.  She's going to need you most to stay in line.  Keep in mind your mother's going to need your help a whole lot more than she ever did before.  No more fights over little things, because I won't be here to stop them anymore.  I know you don't...  Hold on. 
[03:31:00]  I got something in my eye.  He's drooling from the eyes.  Well, don't forget, Rich also had to have a painful talk with his kids, because he left too.  It was a right move, but it's painful.  I didn't have a fucking talk with them.  Well, you know what I'm saying.  Jesus.  See you in 17.  Jesus.  I know you don't want this.  Neither do we.  But sometimes things happen that we can't foresee. 
[03:31:30]  Now try to be calm, kids, and don't look so sad.  Just because I'm leaving, I'll still be your dad.  Just remember I love you.  And though I'm not here, just call if you need me.  I'll always be near.  Well, I have to go now, so kiss me goodbye.  My eyes are just red, kids.  I'm too big to cry.  Aww.  Look at his eyes.  I'm not crying over that.  Shit, I'm an adult.  That was really convincing the way you said that.  Shit, I'm an adult.  Well, because here's the thing.  As an adult, you can't be abandoned. 
[03:32:00]  As a kid, you can be abandoned.  Sure, you can.  You can't be abandoned if you have car keys.  That was a horrible rendition, too.  A horrible reading.  Was it really?  You did better with the Louis Beans fucking speech there.  You wanted me to act it out or just fucking me?  A little drama to it.  A little fucking.  It was a monotone delivery.  Look at his eyes.  He's crying.  No, I'm not.  I got something in my eye. 
[03:32:30]  I'm not crying.  You are crying.  Why are you rubbing your eyes?  Why do you have in your eye?  Because it itches.  My left eye, I only cry.  I only cry out of one eye.  What, are you going to cry?  What, are you going to cry?  What, do I just cry out of one eye?  What, are you going to cry?  What, are you going to cry?  You going to squirt?  You going to squirt?  You going to squirt?  What do you have in your eye besides not the sparkle of understanding?  Besides not a gleam of comprehension.  What do you have in your eyes?  Dead life.  This eye is like a doll's eye. 
[03:33:00]  Like a doll's eye.  His head popped out.  He said he was dodging her and his head popped back in.  Well, that was a sad time for, uh...  Yeah, it must have been.  How could it not be a sad time?  For a little Richie.  For, you know, I had my...  Little Richie Voss.  I had, you know, real big teeth as a kid and a fucked up head and...  Oh, boy.  What was wrong with your head?  It just was misshapen and a bad haircut.  Leaks fluid, like an old transmission. 
[03:33:30]  He just decided to shave your brain down.  Hey, you want to hear Big A doing some John Candy?  Yeah.  We're all over the place today.  Big A, have you been studying?  Yes.  All right, here's the original.  Oh, I thought you meant to end his life like John Candy.  Oh.  Sorry, Big A.  Planes, Trains, and Automobiles.  Just a terrific movie, even though it's star Steve Martin.  Wait, can we hear Big A's first and then the original after?  Because I don't want to put pressure on him to do it right.  Do you think that'll work?  Yeah, try it.  We'll try it once.  Do you think it'll...  Yeah.  Just give it a shot.  Yeah.  All right.  If you don't have any objections. 
[03:34:00]  All right.  Okay.  Well, it has to start with...  Rich, why don't you make fun of Big A again?  Do you want to humiliate him?  Make yourself feel better?  Make fun of that jackass.  It stinks.  Oh, jeez.  That's your cue.  Big A cue.  You want to hurt me?  Go right ahead.  If it makes you feel any better, I'm an easy target.  Yeah.  You're right.  I talk too much. 
[03:34:30]  I also listen too much.  I could be a cold, hard, cynic like you.  But I don't want to hurt people's feelings.  Well, you think what you want about me.  And I'm changing.  And I'm not changing. 
[03:35:00]  I like...  I like me.  My wife likes me.  My customers like me.  Because I'm the real article.  What you see is what you get.  I see a blithering idiot.  In the movie, that actually made you feel sympathy for the character.  It just makes me want to punch you.  It was so fucking frustrating hearing you say that. 
[03:35:30]  John Candy was so great.  Here's the original.  You want to hurt me?  Go right ahead if it makes you feel any better.  I'm an easy target.  Yeah, you're right.  I talk too much.  I also listen too much.  I could be a cold-hearted, cynic like you.  But I don't like to hurt people's feelings.  Well, you think what you want about me.  I'm not changing.  I like... 
[03:36:00]  I like me.  My wife likes me.  My customers like me.  Because I'm the real article.  What you see is what you get.  Wow.  That's great.  I got chills.  Yeah.  Because even when he's saying, I like me, you know, he's like, not really sure of himself.  I like me.  He stutters over there.  I like me.  Yeah, John Candy was...  He was good.  He was really good.  Yeah, he was fucking...  He was great in a movie called Only the Lonely with Maureen O'Hara.  I mean, he and Demi...  No, Ali Sheedy.  Yeah.  He was a pretty good actor, man.  What a shame he died. 
[03:36:30]  Absolutely.  Shame.  All right.  Well, now that we're all depressed.  The end of that movie is awful.  It's really sad, but he's just holding his hat.  His little fat hands.  His little hat.  Yeah, he's holding his hat.  Needing the fucking brim of the hat.  What movie was that?  The one with Ali Sheedy holding his hat?  What fucking movie?  No, it was Stripes.  What fucking...  You go from one movie to the other.  The end of Planes, Trains, and Automobiles.  I don't remember him holding his hat.  What the fuck?  Of course you don't.  It's the last scene where...  I don't remember.  All of a sudden...  Wait, listen to me. 
[03:37:00]  All of a sudden, Steve Martin's wife is like...  Oh.  Welcomes, you know...  Yeah, to her home.  Okay.  Nice to meet you.  Come on in.  The end of that was great.  That actually threw me.  I didn't see that coming.  It was no M. Night Shyamalan.  Shyamalan ding dong.  What was that about?  Shyamalan ding dong.  Sure.  This is great.  I'm just watching a little Maury.  It seems Jenna here, that's 17, says a photographer secretly videotaped her while she was changing.  Oh, my fucking...  And Maury's got it on.  Yeah. 
[03:37:30]  Can you describe the shame you felt?  Oh, little braces?  Yeah, she's got braces on.  She's talking through her braces.  Fuck.  But is she participating in this recreation, reenactment?  I think so.  How about showing the real footage, you fucking whore?  Yeah.  Come on.  Mm-hmm.  You got fruit.  What's wrong, boss?  I saw you.  Yeah, sweetie.  What's the matter?  That's my fucking kids.  What?  What's the matter?  What happened?  Nothing.  It's nothing.  She's just asking for money again.  Oh, boy.  How old is she?  What's the matter?  This one, the 15-year-old is going to be 16.  Can I have the money that I'm going to get for when I babysit for you in two weeks now? 
[03:38:00]  Yeah.  She wants it.  I used to do that with my lunch money.  Give it to her, you cheap fuck.  Why don't you get kids some cash?  I know.  Buy her love.  I fucking just bought one daughter a car.  What the fuck?  In a week?  A car.  I bought one daughter a car and one a stroller in the fucking same week.  It smelled like fucking cabbage in the back?  In the same fucking week.  She actually asked you for money.  Has she seen your act?  Oh, your eyes didn't open up enough for that punchline.  Okay.  You didn't have confidence. 
[03:38:30]  Listen to a Cher song, you sissy.  Cheers, Trampside Queens.  I got you.  If I could turn back.  So, what kind of car did you buy your daughter?  Yeah.  Be honest.  Fucking $14,000 car. 
[03:39:00]  That doesn't mean anything.  Very nice.  That means you could have really gotten ripped off.  No, I got one of those Mazda.  Like, you know, the fucking Mazda.  You forced them to work?  Do they have little jobs out there?  No, they got jobs.  And my daughter, well, she's slick, you know.  She's dodging you?  You know, I got good kids.  She's going to college.  She's taking her, you know, shit.  Her test.  They both work.  So, you bought her a car?  I said, listen.  She wanted to go to an expensive school.  She wanted to go to an expensive, she's kind of smart. 
[03:39:30]  She wanted to go to an expensive, like, college.  I said, listen, go to community college for two years.  Jesus Christ.  Well, hold on.  Don't fucking laugh.  You guys don't fucking know.  You don't have kids.  I said, to find out what you want to do.  Take some business courses.  I have to keep my bills down.  Yeah.  You're right.  And I said, and I'll buy you a car.  Your daughter wanted to go to a good college.  No.  You sent her to community college.  No, you fucking idiot.  That's the 13th grade.  You're sending your own daughter to the 13th grade.  Listen, she wanted to go to the cooking school up in fucking Rhode Island, Johnson, Wales.  It's like $30,000 a year. 
[03:40:00]  And she goes, I want to, I want to, I want to, like, open a candy shop or cook.  I want to learn how to make, you know, candy.  I go, well, get up.  She had a dream of opening her own business.  No, no, no, no, no.  Stop, you fucking idiot.  Send her to a culinary school?  Oh, that's crazy.  No, it is crazy until she takes some business courses.  I'm an associate.  And here's another thing, too.  I want you to go to community college with a minority instead.  No, listen.  Go to Plainfield Tech.  If she goes to two years at Raritan.  Oh, she's not going to resent you by 19 years old? 
[03:40:30]  No, no.  Listen, Debbie, if she goes to fucking Raritan, two years gets good grades, then she gets into  Rutgers.  She's going to get a free set of tools upon graduation?  But she wants to go to Rutgers to begin with.  It's local.  You can go see her.  Why can't she go there now?  Why?  Yeah.  Can she?  Well, not now, because I already put her in a car.  We made the deal.  Why?  Because the pilot wasn't picked up.  Wait a minute.  All three of them.  She's going to go to Rutgers, and you encourage her to go to community college?  Oh, my God.  Dude.  I would have loaned you money. 
[03:41:00]  You are just undermining your kid's education.  Yeah.  Yeah, what are you doing?  This is a crucial moment in your kid's education.  I'm sending my kids to college.  You won't let a kid on your couch.  College.  Shut the fuck up.  You don't know about kids.  I know what I'm doing.  I know what I'm doing.  I wanted to take some business courses, some real estate courses.  At community college?  Do you know what they fucking business course at community college is?  No.  Here's how to fill out a check.  Here's how to use a fucking calculator.  Listen.  If those teachers knew what they were doing, they'd be down on Wall Street. 
[03:41:30]  You're right.  They wouldn't be teaching at community college.  At community college.  Well, that's the same with teachers or professors at fucking Yale or Harvard.  Of course.  The worst teachers at Yale and Harvard.  Well, I'm just using that because you know what I mean.  Yeah.  Well.  Hey, by the way, Matt from Queens.  Oh, my God.  Queensbury.  He writes, Voss, quoting Voss, the 15-year-old is going to be 16.  Oh, you don't say it, you fucking zilch.  I know a 15-year-old who's skipping right to 29, you ass.  Yeah, that's what you told the judge.  Look, they said.  They say. 
[03:42:00]  You're sending out to business school.  And then another one goes from community college right to the pole.  Oh, shit.  No, no, no.  She wanted to go to Rutgers, but I got her a job on the docks in Philly.  So she's going to work as a longshoreman for eight years.  And then she's going to go to college.  Look, I understand there's people listening that go to community college, but the situation  here, that's a big drop-off.  And she wanted to go to college.  A nice college.  She's going to go.  She doesn't want to go.  Like, the fact that she wanted to go means she can't get her in when she wanted. 
[03:42:30]  What if she meets a guy and gets into a relationship?  What are the odds of this?  CNBC showing John Candy from planes, trains, and automobiles taking off his socks on the  air.  That is weird.  Hopefully Steve Martin dropped dead the same way.  It was a Steve Martin clip.  Why you don't like Steve Martin?  I don't know.  Because he fucking, he should have reached into fucking Peter Sellers coffin and stolen  his wallet while he was at it.  Fucking asshole doing a clouseau.  I'm with Jimmy.  Terrible.  All the Hollywood's a remake.  So what do you mean?  I understand that.  But Steve Martin is a comedian. 
[03:43:00]  He's a little bit different.  He should fucking know better.  All right.  If I put on a fucking wacky arrow through my head and went, excuse me.  Would people go, hey, that's a great.  You'd have a closer.  You know, Voss took a lot of punches today.  You're right there, bro.  Punch it back good.  Hey, we got the Pink Panther 2 trail.  You want to hear it, Jimmy?  They're actually making a second Pink Panther.  I know.  It's due to release in 2009.  That's great.  Can we have it?  Please. 
[03:43:30]  Oh, we have to pull it.  But Danny is running around doing everyone else's job.  Are you drinking from that bottle of filling it up?  Where's Steve?  You can't tell.  Why does Danny have to pull it when he's in here?  I don't know.  We'll ask Danny.  Voss.  What's up?  Let's move on.  It's just stuff we don't want to discuss.  Yeah, who cares?  You don't discuss your whole personal life on the air.  We do.  She wants to go to college.  Rich didn't want to pay for it. 
[03:44:00]  Whatever.  It happens to me.  And you guys did hear Jimmy say, I'll lend you the money, though.  I wouldn't lend you the money.  Yes, I would have.  How much?  Huh?  How much?  $30,000.  So I'll do a weekend somewhere.  $30 large.  Oh, that's good.  Please.  I'll do an extra weekend for you.  I'll loan you a dick.  You want a dick with some pre-cum on it?  Here you go.  Borrow this.  Rich.  I don't want to borrow that.  I'll give you the money I make eating lunch.  Okay.  Too bad it's not Bob Kelly. 
[03:44:30]  Dude, I'll give you what I spend on lunch.  That'll be just what she needs.  Dude.  Dude.  What are we doing?  We're telling everybody to go see to MySpace and watch Rich and Bonnie.  Ask Rich and Bonnie.  Rich Voss on MySpace?  Yeah, whatever.  You know how they...  It's all the same, right?  The MySpace.  And what's the big show this weekend?  Oh, the comedy...  What's the name of it?  Comedy something?  Comedy Cove in Springfield, New Jersey.  Comedy Cove.  Rich is in a tough situation because people get confused. 
[03:45:00]  Rich is extremely stupid on this radio show.  But funny.  But very funny.  Very funny.  Who hasn't seen Voss a Traveling Virus?  He always kills.  Yeah.  But people think...  Yeah, but...  People think that they get confused out there.  No, Rich...  Thank you.  ...kicks ass in the comedy clubs.  And where are you going to be?  Comedy Cove in Springfield, New Jersey.  Danny, what's up?  You seem a little...  Oh, slamming doors.  What's your problem?  Oh, boy.  This could be good.  Wow.  It's nothing show-related, but...  I'm a member of a gym. 
[03:45:30]  I'm not going to say which one just yet.  Sure.  Yeah, it wouldn't be a good advertisement for them.  I know.  I know.  It is a surprise to everybody.  You should become a member of a hair salon.  Why?  Let Jimmy have the spotlight.  No, no, no.  I didn't mean that, but I mean a hair joke.  All right, go ahead.  And they just, like, took the vodka out of the water cooler.  To make a very long and boring...  This is dry heaving.  Does that cost you to ab work? 
[03:46:00]  Jack LaLock.  Jack LaLock.  Anybody?  Anybody?  Nah.  So, anywho, they...  Anywho.  As far as, you know, billing practices go with gyms, they're just relentless.  Oh, yeah.  And to make a long and boring story very, very short, there was an account number that got 
[03:46:30]  changed.  They don't have the new number just yet.  And it's not in my name, unfortunately, or else I would just give them what they asked  for.  Right.  And no matter how many representatives that...  They call me every day, twice a day.  Is there a fucking longer version of this?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Go ahead.  Sorry.  So, they just won't stop calling me.  So, now, instead of just trying to be polite, I just scream.  Wait, you owe the money or no?  No.  No, like I said, like, it was billed under one, under a certain card number, and the  card number got changed, so they need the new one, but I don't have it. 
[03:47:00]  It's under, it's the billing person, contact to somebody else.  Oh, boy.  So, they keep calling me, and I keep explaining to them, you gotta talk to this other person,  and they just don't want to listen to me.  You should get their names.  What's your name?  Hey, fucking Norrin called me yesterday, or whoever.  Dude, I know, and I, you know how many people I've spoken to already that said, oh, I'm  sorry, we'll, you know, we'll update, we'll update your billing and make sure that we don't  call you again, and after they said they weren't going to call me, I still got three  more calls, and, like, I used to do that kind of shit, so I'm very, very patient with  these people, but since probably Thursday, I just got, like, and I'm not even exaggerating, 
[03:47:30]  probably the 13th phone call.  Wow.  You should get every name, and then say, so-and-so, this is who I talk to, and one of them  will eventually do their jobs.  Hey, boss, are you sending your girls to the, through the New Jersey Stars program?  No, what's that?  Oh, where you go to community college for free for two years, and then Rutgers for the...  Well, that's what we're going to try, if you get good grades at community college, then  you get into Rutgers on a good deal.  You know, people got to chill.  Artie's on the line, he wants to defend community colleges. 
[03:48:00]  We're just fucking making jokes on it.  No, no, no.  No, we're actually not making jokes on it.  Oh, yeah, hold on.  He's probably talking to the fucking earpiece to get the mouthpiece by his ear.  Go ahead, you're stupid, you're on.  Yo.  Yeah, dummy.  Hey, Artie.  Hey, how you doing?  Big fan, guys.  Thank you, Artie.  Listen, I'm just saying that the community college, my kids went to private school their  whole lives, and I sent them up to school, they fricking flunked out, cost me a frigging  bloody fortune, and went to community college, straightened their act out, and then went away.  Yeah, see, you thought it was doing well, though.  What, sir?  No, first of all, you don't want to take a chance on a $30,000 college until you want 
[03:48:30]  to see if they go, how they adapt to going to college.  So you take a year or two years in community college before you make that jump to a big  college.  Yeah.  It's a smart move.  I know.  It's a smart move.  I know.  It's a smart move.  Isn't it funny how people without kids give you advice on kids?  Okay, but I'm not applying it either, but I can give advice on flying lightning.  No, you can't.  No, you can't.  Don't do it.  No.  You don't have to have kids to use common sense.  No, it's not common sense.  It's practical nowadays, because kids can't make that decision at 17 years old what they 
[03:49:00]  want to do or have any clue of what they want to do.  I don't disagree with Voss.  I mean, college tuition is so ridiculous.  It is.  It is like taking a chance.  It's gambling.  When I went to Geneseo, and the parents said goodbye to their daughters and stuff, next thing  you know, the daughters are pulling trains and out every fucking night, and you know  the parents are back home paying the fucking bills.  That doesn't happen at community college.  Community college, you have to commute for the most part, so it's probably not as much.  Listen, I just blow guys in the parking lot. 
[03:49:30]  I think I learned something.  It always goes back to you.  I think I learned something today, though, because I think the parents are feeling a lot  of pressure.  They're like, fuck, my girl wants to go to a $30,000 a year college.  What if she goes up there and doesn't understand how serious this is?  Or is her ass off flunks out after a semester?  Look, here's the deal, though.  Let me explain something.  Obviously, you should know through your kid's high school career whether they're ready, 
[03:50:00]  willing, and able to take on real college and do well.  Do you know if your daughter, she wants to go to good school?  Okay, so basically, so what you're saying is me to go, oh, my kid is too dumb to go to  real college?  No.  Yes!  Because that's pretty much it.  No, she's not dumb.  A 17-year-old does not know, unless your kid has been focused since 5th or 6th grade  and it's like, your parents, yeah, that knows our parents that completely are pushing their  kids over the limit.  Not pushing, there's no happy medium.  There's no just knowing what your kid, like, you don't know if your kid is ready for school. 
[03:50:30]  She's been through fucking 12 years of school since first grade.  She gets up to 12th grade.  And both of my kids have good grades.  They always make the honor roll.  So then why would you want them to continue doing the best that they can?  I do want them to continue.  I do want them to continue.  Would you let somebody build your house without being an apprentice before they built your  house?  Do carpenters, are they apprentices?  I'd look at their 12-year track record and see if they could build.  Everybody's an apprentice before they jump into anything.  Stop saying apprentice.  Okay.  So whatever. 
[03:51:00]  So community college.  He's trying to tell me to describe Steve's car.  It's an apprentice.  It's an apprentice.  Go on, gas.  I don't care.  It doesn't, you know, you're not letting a comic on stage and open mic her until they  do open mics and they work their way.  But I'm saying 12th weekend in Springfield.  And even, not even the whole school thing, but let's say four years of high school.  Yeah.  You should know after four years of looking at your kid and seeing what their grades are  and see how they act in school if they're ready to take on the responsibilities of a good 
[03:51:30]  college.  Or if they have to sit there.  What?  It doesn't.  You can't monitor.  Why doesn't it work that way?  It doesn't work that way because, I mean, even the smart kids, they're brilliant.  They're out.  I mean, I was forcing my daughter to run away and she did real well, but I knew damn well  she was out partying.  Well, it's nice.  Her roommate slunked out because they got drunk all the time.  Yeah.  She at least knew that there was repercussions and she didn't finish.  There's a bunch of parents agreeing with Voss.  So then why have them go to college at all? 
[03:52:00]  They will.  I'm not saying.  Well, then just send them out to the working world.  I didn't say she's not going to college.  I said two years to find out what she's comfortable doing.  And then she goes to a college.  I didn't say.  But that's not fair to the kids.  So it's almost like being left back.  That's not fair to the kid because a lot of these kids, they want to go to college and  get their fucking career started.  I don't have to work.  They're preventing them from what?  Nowadays, they get that started in junior high school.  Nice.  Jesus.  It's just a fucking joke, Rich.  I know.  I said they get it started in junior high.  I was making even another joke compared to yours. 
[03:52:30]  Oh, yeah.  There was a smile on your face.  Huh?  She wants to go to college.  Yeah.  What about the social aspect of college?  Meeting new people and then smoking a little dope.  Responsibility, independence.  What?  She's not going to talk to people at community college?  She could have went to...  You added two years to her school.  People you don't want her hanging with.  People you don't want her bringing home.  What's that?  She's going to be talking to people you don't want her bringing home.  That's true.  Yeah.  Well, I can get an estimate on my lawn.  You added two years to her school.  Yeah.  It's almost like she's being left back now. 
[03:53:00]  That you're leaving her back for two years.  And she's going to be in the job market now two years later than all of the people that...  And she's going to be there more confident and knowing what she wants.  Really?  Really, brochure?  And she'll transfer it and it's...  You know what?  It's brochure.  Oh, God.  Really, brochure?  Will she make friends and visit exotic places?  Foss, I didn't force my fiancé to go to community school.  Oh.  She had to finish high school first. 
[03:53:30]  Right to the big university for my fiancé.  People are recommending Hamburger U.  The Clown University.  She's going to Clown College.  You know what?  I think I learned something today.  Because when we went to college...  Yeah, lost as a chiseler.  Back in the day when we went to college, tuition was nothing.  Oh, my God.  It was nothing for the most part.  Listen, you know, a college isn't for everybody anyhow.  Now it's like a scary fucking thing.  Rich is getting her an ed-ducation.  Hey, R.P. 
[03:54:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Just give you an idea.  About $70,000 a year.  Yeah, I know.  Wagner's $18,000 a semester.  Who the fuck has that money?  The school she wanted to go to was $30,000 a year to make fucking cookies.  It's bullshit what's going on with the college system.  Completely bullshit.  Big business, guys.  It's a big business.  It's not stupid education.  It's a big business.  I got friends in their 30s.  They're still paying off college.  And they didn't go to be a doctor or a lawyer just the four lousy fucking years. 
[03:54:30]  I didn't even go to school.  Look how well I'm doing.  Well.  Yeah, exactly.  That's the reaction you should have got.  Artie, thank you.  All right, guys.  What did I miss?  What the fuck did I miss?  What did I miss?  Norton was sitting with his ass open.  So I guess he's trying to get another deal.  I was just sitting with my legs open like this.  Boss nails him. 
[03:55:00]  He's sitting in like a gynecological pose almost.  My pants were pulled out of my thighs.  Ready for this?  Travis, come on in.  Trav-i?  We're going to have to wait for Travis to get situated, but then he's got something good  to say.  Oh, I know.  This takes forever.  Pull the seat out.  Take a seat.  You do what you always do.  Get the headphones.  All right.  Travis is getting the headphones.  Put them on.  Get some water.  Pull the mic up.  Adjust the volume.  Holy shit, Travis.  All right.  That's why I don't come to the studio.  Travis, what do you got?  I have $70,000 in college loans. 
[03:55:30]  All right.  Well, look where you are.  That's why you're scared.  He can't even eat.  Look at him.  That was only for communication.  I graduated with a communications degree.  Yeah.  $70,000.  And you're in the number one market in the country.  Yeah.  Yes.  But really miserably.  Working?  No.  I'm not saying where I am now is bad, but I'm saying if just for communications, it's  $70,000.  I pay $600 a month in student loans.  Who are you talking to?  And I went to community college.  I went where his daughter's going.  Booty hooty hoo.  Before I went to school. 
[03:56:00]  Oh, before you went to real school.  Yes.  So if you would have went to real school first, you'd have been ahead of the game.  Exactly.  No, because the classes that she's taken in community college count for regular classes.  Are you shitting into a bottle?  I just farted.  You just wanted an excuse to put that bottle in your ass.  I farted into a water bottle and then squeezed the bottle so Travis could get the goodness. 
[03:56:30]  Oh, my God.  Here's something.  Here's a who gives a shit thing.  But in high school, I did very, very well.  And then I went to Geneseo for communications first semester.  You went to where?  Geneseo.  Oh, okay.  Actually, it's a pretty impressive school these days.  Back in the day, it wasn't.  And I almost failed out after my first semester because I was brought up extremely strict.  My mom wouldn't let me do shit.  So when I went to college, it was all about, holy shit, freedom, partying, everything. 
[03:57:00]  You drank when you got up there?  Hall, like you wouldn't believe.  Seven days a week.  I was out of my mind.  I almost failed out.  I had to go to all my teachers and get a grade.  I had C minuses and Ds.  I'm like, could you just give me a C minus and then I could stay another semester?  My communication fucking teachers wouldn't give me the higher grade to allow me to continue going to Geneseo.  They're like, well, communications isn't for everyone.  I remember a fucking professor telling me that.  Do you have your contact with him since? 
[03:57:30]  No, but I know some fine stories about his daughter and what happened in a fraternity house fucking closet once.  Nice.  Fuck yourself.  You may have made your career, though, because you went to Weez at 18.  No, no.  No, what happened was, no, I needed the education because it had a good college radio program.  So I had to go to another class that was one of these throwaway classes.  And the guy listened to my story.  I go, I need another shot at this.  And he gave me the higher grade so I could continue.  But the fucking communication teacher said, go fuck yourself. 
[03:58:00]  Wow.  And I did really well in high school.  So, you know, you never know.  You never know.  How did your headphones just fall off your head?  His brain was trying to escape his head.  Actually, there's fucking no thoughts in there pushing the skull out.  So they just kind of collapsed and fell off.  There's nothing in there.  All right.  Why don't we get to the line of the day?  So, Travis, it was 70 G's.  70,000? 
[03:58:30]  Dude, tuition is ridiculous.  And what is it?  I mean, that's got to be fucking crazy.  That's a mortgage.  Don't pay it.  In Pennsylvania.  What can they do?  You have to.  What can they do?  They put a lot of pressure on you.  And then you file for bankruptcy at a young age.  Why would I want to do that?  Yeah, Danny's holding both fists in the air.  Did you do that?  I did bankruptcy.  God bless you.  And then after a few years, you're set.  You're still a young guy.  And you're all fucking wiped out of debt.  Nice.  I filed bankruptcy.  I was a month.  On my 18th birthday.  I was just 21.  Oh.  How much did you owe? 
[03:59:00]  Dude, it wasn't a lot.  He owed like $85.  It wasn't a lot.  It's a fucking costo.  But for a kid that young, it was a lot.  It was probably about $13,000.  Yeah, that's a lot.  That's a lot, though, for that age, man.  It was a lot.  Did they call you more than 13 times?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Dude, I owed a shitload of money when I was in Buffalo, and I was making $12,000 a year.  And they would call me around the clock, and I would just openly laugh at the lady.  I'm like, what are you going to do?  What could you possibly do to me that makes my life worse?  I'm living in a shithole, making no money. 
[03:59:30]  How are you even threatening me?  There's nothing you can get from me.  I did bankruptcy, and I remember owning paint stores.  So I'm going to give Essel's paint.  Here's a couple plugs.  This will pay back a little of what I owed.  Essel's paint.  Essel's paint.  I owed about $25,000.  We did bankruptcy at $12,000 or $13,000.  $12,000?  No, maybe $20,000.  I owed $25,000 when I was like 28 and making the exact same amount.  I was making about $25,000 a year, and I owed $25,000 in credit card bills. 
[04:00:00]  And you did bankruptcy, too?  No.  Oh.  I fucking stuck it out and said, I'm going to be in the radio business and make good money  and be able to pay this off.  Or not.  Wow.  I was so happy to finally pay off my credit card.  It was really bad.  Oh.  Once I paid off that last one, fuck.  I was just like, that rules good.  I pay off everything every month I get.  I have no...  That's what I do.  Because I don't want to pay the interest.  Yeah, me too.  I just owe one credit card, $12,000.  I should just pay it all off.  Why wouldn't you?  I paid it all off. 
[04:00:30]  Why?  Do all your expenses on one credit card.  Yeah.  Why are you putting your headphones like that?  Because it hurts my ear when I do both ears.  It hurts that ear.  What's wrong with that ear?  Nothing.  You have a cyst on it?  No, I don't have a cyst on it.  No, it hurts my ears if we're on too long.  Me too.  For some reason.  That's why I start going...  Even though I'm doing the show, I'll just start going, ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Line of the day brought to you by Cardscan.  We have a lot of them, so why don't we start this?

[04:01:00]  Right to the first runner-up line of the day.  All right.  If we're admitting things today, I like boobies because I wasn't breastfed as a child.  Aw.  Yeah, that's why.  Well, it's funny because I was, and I like them too, but only my mother's.  That's why Opie keeps E-Rock around.  Or a good suckling.  That was a smorgasbord.  Poor E-Rock.  It really was a conglomeration of jokes.  E-Rock took a little...  How's Excalibur doing over there? 
[04:01:30]  Oh, Excalibur's very good.  This is my computer named Excalibur.  Excalibur.  Wouldn't you like to use my BlackBerry?  No.  Do you have a BlackBerry?  No.  Rich, do you have a BlackBerry?  No.  You know, I was thinking of getting one because these are decent.  Here's the next runner-up line of the day.  I give my kids, I give kids all the affection and attention that, you know, you can give  a kid without going to jail.  What kind of phone do you have?  That made me laugh really hard. 
[04:02:00]  Apex Tech, the old guy from the commercial is waiting.  My car from Toronto.  Apex Tech.  Now, I can't call you.  I know.  I don't use to have a funny joke about that.  Now, I can't phone you because I cut up both my fucking hands on a diesel rig.  What do you mean, used to?  Do you guys remember Dr. Pecoraro?  Yeah.  The back doctor.  What?  He was a back doctor. 
[04:02:30]  A back doctor.  A chiropractor.  Dr. Pecoraro.  A local guy.  And Otto used to do a take-off on his commercial.  It was fucking so...  Can we find the commercial?  Possibly?  I'm Dr. Pecoraro.  Please, somebody can find that before the end of the show because Otto's joke was just wonderful.  And we got to get the Pink Panther trailer for tomorrow, too.  Dr. Pecoraro.  If anyone's listening in the back office.  That was Voss and Voss.  I keep forgetting.  Comedy.  Comedy Cove in Springfield, New Jersey. 
[04:03:00]  Okay, good.  Friday and Saturday.  MySpace.  Yes, Rich and Bonnie.  And he's backing this giant ship into a slip that barely can fit the boat.  We're talking about boats?  Yeah.  Okay.  Hey, easy.  Easy, chief.  My mom you're talking about.  I love that.  Call me cheap.  Easy, chief.  That was a good one.  You made that jump.  I wasn't. 
[04:03:30]  Of course.  I wouldn't dare, man.  Sal scares the shit out of me.  The only time we ever were threatened to a point where I was literally scared for my life.  Oh.  It was an answer.  Sal's fine.  It was a wonderful day.  No, I love the guy.  He's a good egg.  Here's the next runner-up line of the day.  I guessed the sound today.  Rich, I want you to try to guess what this is.  Because I think you're the only one in the room that doesn't know what this is.  Everybody else does.  Okay?  Okay.  Listen to this.  That's the sound of a high school diploma. 
[04:04:00]  To me.  Bonnaroo this weekend.  Bonnaroo.  I was supposed to go, but I fucking blew it.  God damn it.  Why don't you just go?  It's too late now.  It's too late.  It's too late.  It's easy.  It's just too late.  Make last minute plans to go down to Tennessee.  Make sure you say hi to King of Leon for Jay Moore.  I don't know who that is.  That was a really funny reference.  I'm going to see Chris Rock and Metallica on Friday. 
[04:04:30]  What?  And then do my show Saturday, Sunday, and then come home Monday.  Nice.  Is Metallica working on a new album?  Yeah.  With Rick Rubin.  Oh, fuck.  Yeah.  Oh, fuck.  That'll probably be great.  Do they have the therapist?  Shitty drumming, but it should sound good.  Right, Danny?  Well, we'll see.  Rick Rubin, he's a good boy.  Yeah, yeah.  Adam Dubin was his roommate.  Rocky's husband.  You know Adam or no?  Sure.  That was his roommate in college, Rick Rubin.  No shit.  Wow.  Wow.  Oh, my. 
[04:05:00]  That's right.  Some Kind of Monster is a great documentary with the therapist.  Holy shit.  And then they have to tell the therapist they don't need him anymore.  And he pretty much needed a therapist because he couldn't handle the news that the band was giving him.  Was he hurt?  Oh, boy, was he.  He really saw the future where he would just be hanging with fucking Metallica for the rest of their careers.  So what happened?  Why did they just get sick of him?  I watched part of it.  It was great.  I don't remember any.  You didn't see the whole thing?  No, I was on a plane and we hit him out.  I think the band just. 
[04:05:30]  Was Excalibur saved?  Excalibur saved everybody on the plane because he was at the front of the plane being admired by the pilots and took the brunt of the impact.  Excalibur to the rescue.  Who are we talking to today?  Huh?  I think Jimmy has multiple personalities.  Who are we talking to today?  Me.  Like when Maury gets these freaks on TV.  So who are we talking to today?  Who are we talking to today?  Is this Sarah?  Yes.  It's Sarah.  Hi, Sarah. 
[04:06:00]  Hi.  Is Jimmy there, too?  Yes.  It's weird.  How could you possibly get your lips any smaller than they are?  Unbelievable that you could do that.  Look at that.  Look at that.  Sometimes I like to be kissed.  That looks like your asshole.  I could hold up a mirror and say the same about you.  Look at that.  It's hard to be funny with lips.  Who are we talking to today? 
[04:06:30]  Huh?  Who are you?  Who are we talking to?  Who?  I used to date this girl.  She used to hate when I would make my mouth that small because I would just call her  Little Mouth Man.  I'd say Little Mouth Man.  Little Mouth Man.  But I would smile like this.  Little Mouth Man.  I'm Little Mouth Man.  Who's with us today?  Just me.  Who are you?  Little Mouth Man.  Okay, Little Mouth Man.  That's right.  Can we speak to Bobby? 
[04:07:00]  Can we speak?  I'm lonely.  And who are you?  I'm Richard's brain.  There's a lot of room in here.  I'm in a room that's far too big for me.  Oh, shit.  Another runner-up?  Okay.  I don't know.  I just kind of sometimes lose touch with the way my body.  I don't feel anything in my body. 
[04:07:30]  That's because there's a lot of flesh on it.  Oh, God.  Damn.  Especially since I've lost so much weight, Rich.  I mean...  You do.  You look good.  I know.  You do.  Boss, I'm going to give you a B-plus on today's appearance.  Thank you.  Wow.  That's not bad.  It's usually very critical of you.  I want to feel your muscle.  Really?  Just feel it, Rich.  We all have.  It's no big deal.  No, because you're going to do something.  Oh, really?  What do you want to do?  Oh, that's nice.  Nice.  That's my cock.  That's nice. 
[04:08:00]  My cock.  Let me see.  Take your shirt off and do it.  No, I don't have really a definition.  It's just brute strength.  That's fucking good, man.  Yeah, I just lift fucking...  I lift garbage cans.  Fucking truck tires.  And who do we have today?  Huh?  Who are you?  I don't know.  Nameless strong dude.  From Chicago.  I just lift up tables.  I throw them at blacks.  Throw them at blacks?  I love the multiple personality shows.  Those are the worst.  I lift up him.  That's what I do. 
[04:08:30]  Big A?  Big A.  I throw up my head.  I fucking throw him.  Big A.  Here's another runner-up line of the day.  Oh.  Another runner-up line of the day.  Here it is.  Scary things in the room.  Like if something looks like scary.  What's that, a real emotion?  Love?  Child friendship?  An AA meeting?  Yeah. 
[04:09:00]  All of the above.  Wow.  You know what?  It looks like we have someone angry in studio.  And who are you?  Jim, tying his shoe.  Jim, tying his shoe tire.  That's what I do when I'm steps.  I crawl on the sidewalk.  I don't even walk.  Looking for loose shoes.  I'll just go up and I pat people's feet and I judge the thickness of their laces and the  tightness of the bows. 
[04:09:30]  Of the bows.  That's right.  Big A, you have fun today.  That's a yes.  That's a yes.  Hey, should we have Big A sing us out today?  All muffin feet.  Those big fucking fat muffin shoes.  You want him to do Stand By Me or Stay by Lisa Loeb?  I don't know.  Whatever baby girl wants.  Another runner-up?  Line of the day?  What?  Last runner-up.  Line of the day.  He got a food issue, but that was the original lyric.  They would write a song and he would throw in a lyric to hold the place and it was scrambled 
[04:10:00]  eggs for yesterday.  Oh.  Scrambled legs.  Was he writing about George Howard's brain?  Oh, no.  See, I can have fun too, guys.  Jesus, that's such an asshole.  Scrambled eggs.  You're just a fucking obnoxious dick.  I hate myself.  Always have.  Notice how everyone just got quiet?  Let him go.  Jimmy's saying, it's about time you acknowledge it.  No. 
[04:10:30]  Hello?  Who's on the phone, Jimmy?  We're still broadcasting.  What do you mean?  Uh-oh.  That's concerned guy.  Uh-oh.  Oh, concerned guy.  You know what's on the phone.  Oh, wow.  I was just showing you.  This is concerned guy.  Oh, my God.  That acting is, he is good at that.  Call Marty.  Me and Marty.  Shut up.  It's Martin.  All right.  Before Big A sings us out, let's do Line of the Day. 
[04:11:00]  Where are you driving to kick somebody out of the house?  No, Rick.  I'm driving to a television program where I work here in Hollywood.  Oh, I am proud to be a lesbian. 
[04:11:30]  I'm proud to be a lesbian.  All right.  Very nice.  Big A, you ready to sing us out?  Yes.  Which one will work?  Which one will work, you think?  Stand by me or stay?  What is Muscle Fez doing out there?  Hey.  Muscle.  I don't know.  What?  Either one of those.  They don't really.  Oh, who do we have over there?  Somebody jingling their keys. 
[04:12:00]  I'm Ted the key jingler.  Oh, Ted's delightful guy.  Ted's a popular guy.  He's a jack of all trades.  Yes.  He jingles keys.  That's right.  He makes filaments that are very expensive.  I know.  Here's what I do.  I go to parties, and I rent myself out as a wind chime on unwindy days.  Which one did we decide to go with? 
[04:12:30]  I was going to say maybe if he wants to do Stand By Me, just because he's probably more  familiar with that than Lisa Loeb.  Yeah, I think Danny's right.  That's a good call.  Let's do Stand By Me as we leave you.  Thank you, Rich.  Rich, you were great today.  Thank you.  We'll see you on the golf course soon.  Hey.  Big A doing Stand By Me.  Ron and Fez, noon to three.  Thank you. 
[04:13:00]  When the night has come, and the land is dark, and the moon is the only light we'll see.  Stand By Me.  No, I won't be afraid.  No, I won't be afraid.  No, I won't be afraid. 
[04:13:30]  Just as one accused.  Stand by me.  Stand by me.  If the sky that we looked upon should tumble and fall, all the mountains should crumble to the sea.  If the sky that we looked upon should tumble and fall, all the mountains should crumble to the sea. 
[04:14:00]  I won't cry.  I won't cry.  I won't cry.  No, I won't shed a tear.  No, I won't shed a tear.  No, I won't shed a tear.  If as long as you stand by me stand by me stand by me.  And darling, darling, stand by me, oh stand by me, stand by me, stand by me, stand by me, yeah. 
[04:14:30]  Whenever you're in trouble, would you stand by me, stand by me, oh stand by me, oh stand by me. 
[04:15:00]  Oh stand by me, oh stand by me, oh stand by me, stand by me.
