<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a comedic Larry King impression before diving into a discussion dominated by sex, bodily functions, and highly offensive language. Opie recounted a severe bout of diarrhea, setting the tone for the show's graphic and explicit nature.  The conversation quickly moved to Bette Midler's early career in a gay bathhouse, sparking a lengthy and detailed, sexually explicit discussion of bathhouses and gay sexual culture, along with comparisons to other ethnic stereotypes.  This transitioned into graphic descriptions of sexual preferences, personal sexual experiences (including encounters with prostitutes), the impact of pornography, and the role of the mind in sex.  The hosts also briefly touched upon the films *Prometheus* and *The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo*.  Jim Norton was present for this segment.

The show then shifted gears, briefly discussing a cringeworthy movie scene (possibly from *Back to the Future*) before a break for food.  Upon returning, a prolonged, vulgar chant involving "Mimi Beardsley" and sexually explicit phrases ensued.

Following this, Anthony discussed the negative aspects of his marriage, focusing on his ex-wife taking $40,000 from their joint account during the divorce. He vehemently expressed his hatred of marriage.  The conversation then turned to the Jerry Sandusky trial, expressing anger and disgust at the accusations.  This led to a discussion on steroid use in professional sports (baseball and UFC), followed by a graphic description of a Japanese man selling portions of his surgically removed genitals.  The show continued with a discussion on the ethics of eating seafood and the cruelty involved in animal slaughter, concluding with childhood anecdotes about misusing Vaseline.

A subsequent segment focused on embarrassing childhood stories shared by Opie, Anthony, and a caller named Bobby.  Bobby recounted a disastrous seventh-grade dance and a missed opportunity with a girl, while Anthony shared similar experiences of missed romantic chances. The segment included tangents on 80s hairstyles, the challenges of sex as a teenager, anxieties about aging and hair loss, and a humorous, explicit promotion of the audiobook "Fifty Shades of Gay."  Anthony also recounted witnessing a classmate being bullied and his regret at not intervening. The conversation further meandered through childhood fights, petty crimes (including stealing lunch tickets and drug dealing), and Opie's current weight struggles.  The segment concluded with an enthusiastic discussion of Bobby's new inflatable pontoon boat, complete with a promotional video analysis.

The final segment was characterized by profanity-laced anger, particularly directed at someone named "Chip." The hosts discussed a comedian's upcoming performances and a new show on Riotcast.com, venting about controlling publicists and the power dynamics in show business, particularly focusing on the difficulties in securing Billy Corrigan as a guest. This led to discussions about a previous black guest, Arsenio Hall's career, photos of a man named Earl Douglas, Niecy Nash, and various television shows.  The hosts also discussed Comic-Con plans, potentially interviewing Seth MacFarlane, their use of Twitter, a past animated project, childhood pranks (including throwing urine and melting ice cream), and searching for information about a deceased former friend, "Looch" (Luciano). They also discussed how to conduct a Reddit AMA, before concluding the main show with a call for listeners to share what they had learned.  The after-show briefly mentioned Opie's illness and a listener call-in segment focused on the day's lessons.

[00:01:30]  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh! 
[00:02:00]  point where he said in yesterday that he almost had to go to the emergency room  because he couldn't he couldn't get out of bed like he was shitting in bed so  apparently obi's been shitting all over his butt cheeks and legs in bed hope he's okay  ow that's gotta hurt when you gotta sit there and wait it out until you could even use the toilet  paper yeah just better sit here and relax for a while let the old fires calm down 
[00:02:30]  i took one yesterday during the show last night i guess during yeah i had i literally had to walk  out of the studio in the middle of a break i remember that and i was shitting and i dropped  a lot and then i'm like there's a lot more to come wow you know that feeling like the churning is still  happening like you know if you stand up you're just gonna have to sit back down oh so you might  as well just stay yeah that's how that works and i did it's wonderful yeah um i like to welcome  aboard guy this morning you see he comes sometimes i walk in there he comes up with something new 
[00:03:00]  what did he say today he goes uh welcome aboard yeah right through that door right through that  door oh wow like it was paradise like i when i open that door it's gonna look like when uh  dorothy opened the door and it was all in color just amazing right through that door i just started  cracking up is that the best the best i don't reveal but that's gotta be one of the best switches  ever in a movie yeah it's been referenced so much over the years because it is one of those things 
[00:03:30]  it's like you know oh yeah it's like when she comes out and everything's in color yeah for them to  think of doing that in 1939 i guess because a lot of shit was in black and white that was in color  but what made him think of doing both you would think if if colored if color really just came out  they would want the entire fucking movie to be in color but you'd be like i want color film color  color and then they went with the black and white at the beginning and the end because yeah it must  have been a time where black and white would still be acceptable for the first few minutes people 
[00:04:00]  thought it was black and white they didn't all just walk out yeah yeah yeah that would be angering  if you just like thought the movie was what the fuck is this heard it was in color that's a genius movie  like when you think about the reveal at the end with who the people were  you never ever would saw it coming yeah i think unless you read the books maybe oh was that in  the books was it the same kind of ending yeah i think so are there any gay people that could call  us and let us know yes boy the homosexuals love that movie well it's judy garland they can't get enough 
[00:04:30]  can't get enough of judy garland for traipsing around that yellow brick road what is it about certain  celebrities that uh attracts the gay community because there was uh like judy garland's huge like  that it's that uh showy kind of over the top singing thing troubled people they loved a good  troubled uh woman the gay community loves it they but they seem to like her before everybody knew she  was trouble like i i think they just like good the certain type of female singers is that it bett middler 
[00:05:00]  yeah they love bett middler and uh marilyn monroe they like a good marilyn i didn't know that  yeah the gays love a good marilyn iconic women and women who can who have something theatrical about  them and you could see them you know in the theater very high drama yeah they like they love that whole  thing share they're big on share and those are all women that transcend their roles like bett middler is 
[00:05:30]  always you know this is an event this is bett middler very well she used to sing in bathhouses  too so she probably a lot of gay guys probably became jesus she did that was yeah and when she  started out in her career i don't know how she would do it but she did perform in bathhouses and  that was how she when she was very uh early on that's like a stuffy atmosphere yeah i don't know  what the what the dynamics were or the setup but i remember hearing that i hope i didn't just hear like  a fucking uh what's a rumor yeah rumor a myth and say why not we do that all the time i know but i've 
[00:06:00]  always thought that just to be so wrong for so long would be hurtful uh yeah bathhouses uh playing in  there uh why even have a performer in a bathhouse it seems like everything you need is there seems  like enough entertainment to go around where you don't really need some broad caterwalling while you're  soaking i'm here to see bett no thank you yeah did you hear bett's gonna be at the bathhouse  i wasn't even gonna go today oh good there she oh yeah you are 
[00:06:30]  in the summer of 1970 middler began singing in the continental a gay bathhouse in the city  during this time she became close to a piano accompanied barry manilow oh i didn't know he  played for her a bagel named bagel and he produced her first album the divine miss m imagine how angry  he was to have to join her in the bathhouse for a gig oh that's right no yeah probably because  they had they all recognized hey weren't you here tuesday mandy trying to sing over it shut up 
[00:07:00]  uh during the time of the continental bathhouse she built up a core following  in the late 1990s during the release of her album bathhouse betty she commented on her time  performing there despite the way things turned out and she's saying with the age crisis i'm still  proud of those days i feel like i was at the forefront of the gay liberation movement  and i hope i did my part to help it move forward so she kind of wears the label bathhouse betty with 
[00:07:30]  pride bathhouse betty yeah wow where in the bathhouse do you perform i don't know through a  fucking socket because you wouldn't think you'd take a break to go watch a performance you'd think  you're there for a reason and once that reason is complete you go home exactly what are you hanging  out for i just doesn't doesn't the word bathhouse conjure up an image don't you just think of i'm  picturing like like real slimy tile floor a few like small bathtub-ish things in the floor and just gay 
[00:08:00]  guys hairy touching i always think of like a one giant pool-sized bathtub and just guys sponging each  other a lot of sponging going on oh there it is oh my god rubbing sponges on each other and they're  all those old sponges that guy's got a surprise coming while he's drying off no that guy's bent  over to dry off or something not even any water in that bad no i always thought of in steam rooms 
[00:08:30]  i was always thinking what is that yeah i assume it's very steamy very uh stuffy oh man crew club's  having a ball in the bathhouse they're in a sauna that's so gayer than the last one that's pretty  gay right there everybody's just having a good time yeah they're holding each other's legs and  arms around each other it's because they're having a good time and hanging out but the implication is  they're also fucking yes there's an implication that's how much they love or they're going to later  like oh yeah like they know they're gonna fuck later so like why don't we just have a good time now 
[00:09:00]  like that's what they're happy about or maybe they just fucked and what's even worse they want to stick  around and still touch each other after they've come yeah like come on let's show some camaraderie  now but i mean the fucking's over but i mean i still have feelings for you does that go on i don't  know i'm thinking bathhouse you're not really going for the uh for the cuddle you're not going for  cuddling afterwards camaraderie yeah because generally camaraderie you don't think you bring a date to the  bathhouse you find no you find a date at the bathhouse you take a date to the bathhouse you're losing 
[00:09:30]  that date i think that's what i'm thinking they'll probably better deal you in a second  my friend better deal you you know uh how on louis we talked about the one it was in season one his  this scene he wrote that was so good about the word faggot with yeah we were all at the poker table  and rick chrome is the comedian who kind of started that discussion off and uh rick uh was the one who  kind of put us up to that fucking that was a real discussion really yeah that louis just captured and 
[00:10:00]  fucking we all had that at the cellar one night that uh yeah uh that's the word faggot but it  started from bathhouses and and all that stuff just talking about this shit yeah and also uh like  those places now where guys just go to jerk off um we wanted to use the name of one in the show but  they wouldn't let their name be used um guys just jerk off and yeah i don't know he he's  they jerk each other off i i'm sure that there's a lot of help yeah but it's not even a bathhouse 
[00:10:30]  anymore i don't think oh they just cut right to the chase just jack me off well i guess because  everybody's afraid of aids but you can't get aids from jerking each other off can you no i think you're  not allowed to to blow each other or like you're not supposed to or that's so okay look at that  he's laying down on a tile shelf like you would have in a shower but his dick is pinned down yeah  he's on his stomach his dick is bent all the way backwards and his his one leg is kind of 
[00:11:00]  cocked no pun intended and he's got this look like yeah fuck me here's the come hither look with a  muscular buttock that's a very muscular buttock what is the name of the place is it uh  oh don't make it seem like you don't know i really don't i've never i've never gone but i think you  said they walk around a lot of the guys walk around in their sneakers with socks on and that's  it that's it and you carry your wallet and your sock which makes me laugh it's practical i guess 
[00:11:30]  probably i'll wear white reeboks and tube socks pulled up yeah there is just something about the  male gay community that just is all about sex or at least that's the perception that is given to  uh heterosexuals i think that's why gays have had such a hard time getting accepted in society over  the years because the normal heterosexual view of gay men is just about it's all about  fucking well because when you think about it like the the common conception with heterosexual guys 
[00:12:00]  is that most guys if just about any woman walked up to you and said let's fuck you'd be like all  right right and so if it's all guys they just do that all the time it's just about  fucking yeah and and to have a whole lifestyle just based on sex it uh a lot of holy rollers don't  like that uh because you know they're a bunch of prudes and it doesn't seem like you'd be able to  lead a productive life when all you're doing is it's like should i go to work today now i'm just 
[00:12:30]  gonna blow somebody yeah i need to find more anonymous sex partners right yeah they one time  voss told me and i know he was being truthful he was driving through the village and it was like uh  there's certain areas of the village where it's just guys just walk around and fucking misbehave  misbehave i don't know if it's as bad as it used to be but voss said he was walking one time and  a guy was crossing the street and he had a coat on and he opened his coat and his penis was just  hanging out in the front of his pants so voss took me back one night we went looking for the guy 
[00:13:00]  to laugh and he goes i never saw him again we rode around looking for the guy you really like  how did the conversation come up that hey you want to go and look for the guy with the dick we i  i don't remember but i know we were howling talking about this guy and i don't even remember  where he was but uh i think he was walking his dog the funny part was he had jacket on and pants with  like his penis just but his dick hanging out well women don't do that no you want that easy access 
[00:13:30]  though i would think if you see somebody walking down the street uh you would open it up and and it  would be like oh yeah this is here for you to blow yeah all right okay and the guy would be very uh  into that yeah not like a woman where she'd be walking down the street you'd do that and go to  jail you know you're just going to get arrested yeah they just want to have it ready yeah hey look  i just got a so good because if you see somebody walking down the street that you would assume would  want to blow you and you're fumbling with your zipper some other guy's going to come in and he's 
[00:14:00]  going to have it out but by the time you get your dick out it's like ah he's already blowing somebody  but can you imagine there's actually a sect of the gay population that goes oh terrific and goes and  blows the guy that's great i was looking for one of those yeah convenient 30 out it's right there  yeah we heterosexuals have a quite the concept of the gay lifestyle and i don't even know if it's  inaccurate or not like i don't know if we're just being silly here or not i think there are productive 
[00:14:30]  gay members of society and and gays who are in right monogamous relationships they're probably  annoyed at this whole thing i would agree with you there i'm not i'm you'd have to be crazy not  to think i mean there there are uh people that have lovely uh flowers in their home yeah great  window treatments oh yeah uh you know a gay block when you drive down a fucking gay block in new york  it's it's nicer than any other block you're just on yes no trash no no garbage at all yeah guys have  their dicks hanging out but yeah you gotta take the pad look at the flowers oh that's so and the 
[00:15:00]  guy's got his cock out the other man's looking at it while holding a small dog all right it's just  very strange we uh we don't really have that down and yeah the the parade the gay parade is another  thing where people just it's another thing that reinforces all that shit that heterosexuals think about  gays yeah very flamboyant dressed up like that with the fairy wings on and just sucking each other's  dicks on a float i've always wondered why like that is so embraced in the gay community because it is 
[00:15:30]  all kind of damaging gay stereotypes on parade yeah it would absolutely be like a black parade where it's  just fried chicken watermelon and doing the soft shoe or just like a bunch of asian people driving  down the road and crashing crashing into each other it's it's all negative stereotypes yeah that  they don't want to put on them for part of it is probably when you feel like your group is not  accepted yeah you embrace you don't feel like you can alienate any part of your group or you don't 
[00:16:00]  want to isolate any part of your group or throw them out to drift oh i thought it was more what you're  going to say is like uh since they're not very accepted they're going to go the other way and go hey  fuck you own the negatives yeah if you don't accept us because you think we're  fucking crazy like this then we're going to be crazy like maybe that's part of it too i mean but i  think it's it's probably a combination of things i don't know like why do like black groups sometimes  will embrace certain guys that you're like hey you should probably be criticizing him uh yeah publicly 
[00:16:30]  but it's like well maybe that's why uh yeah blacks like embrace some stupid shitty leaders because uh  it's like well you're not accepting us this guy is so fuck you yeah i think that's part of it is  you feel bad throwing out any member of your group or kind of publicly  fucking airing that dirty laundry and private gays probably have a lot of  shit to say about certain elements really bright yellow short shorts you're outside  you're wearing underwear and rollerblades what are you doing doing they love to rollerblade i teach 
[00:17:00]  seventh grade what are you doing i don't know what that's uh that's all about like that because  yeah we do look at it kind of like this you're probably right like they're trying so hard to  become accepted that they feel like they have to stay unified because if they start bickering amongst  themselves they'll never hate batman on rollerblades that's exactly right it's like why come on just wear  pants at least no i'd actually rather watch a movie with him than the new batman that'd be a great 
[00:17:30]  new batman suck my cock dark night the cock rises yeah a lot of flowing uh yellows and uh just adorable  stuff there yeah what are you doing it for because you when you look at like straight parades or whatever  they are like based on uh ethnicity there's a lot of crazy kinky sex in the italian puerto rican but  they don't embrace it in the the parade it's not showcased but like bondage snm 
[00:18:00]  fucking golden showers that's all straight stuff but you don't see it in the uh you don't see it  represented in the parades yeah why is uh someone going down batman's uh superman oh it's superman  going down batman's little shorts to pull his dick out that's nice how helpful that is very helpful  of the superheroes it would have been just the opposite though when you think about how things turned out  yeah superman's help going to the restroom do you do you honestly think that when you watch the  uh columbus day parade that the italian americans walking down that parade route are as kinky as the 
[00:18:30]  gay uh parade no maybe not per person in the parade yeah but there's a lot of people in that parade  who probably like a strap-on there's people in that parade who like to be pissed on who like to be  fucking smacked in the face it's like all that weird stuff but they just don't yeah they just don't  dress like it yeah batman there's a figure of batman and robin uh and they're kind of in a little  you know holding each one one's holding the head that's on his shoulder he's resting his head on 
[00:19:00]  robin's shoulder more importantly uh they have no really front of their pants uh robin's tights are  down and both of their dicks are just hanging out and erect well they're kind of half yeah they're  plumped up little more than just plumped where it looks good if you're just kind of out yeah and  a girl would go like wow that looks good that looks like you're trying when you fluff yeah you  can't fluff too much yeah or it looks like you're trying too hard got to fluff right to the point  where it's still moving around a lot it could still it's not twitching you don't gotta be able to hang 
[00:19:30]  it can't be like those are a little upright can't go out like a diving board yeah i like it i like to  plump it up where i can still bend it backwards and forwards oh like a twisty toy that's good  what do you think it is when you ask her it really does depend on um you know who you're with i think  as to how uh how vigorous how how uh what's the word i'm looking for how rigid a rigid sometimes you 
[00:20:00]  can't you can't hide it it's like wow it's very exciting wow i don't want to fluff i like to show it  off yeah yeah yeah well at the beginning yeah at the beginning like the second you you rip your  pants off i don't know if you want to just have something really you want to kind of have it grow  or you want it to be there already saying how do you do what's better than when it's hanging just  how you want it when you were the girl for the first time oh yeah and you slide your sweats down  and there it is right and you know that it's all downhill from here but that one moment where she 
[00:20:30]  thinks it's better than it is that wonderful moment where she thinks she's getting satisfied  wow i do like the the girl that you've been waiting for you're with her for the first time  and you're wearing sweatpants there's no romance well the reality is she's a prostitute and she's come  to see me there are inconvenient clothes that you could be wearing sweatpants are very convenient  yeah on both parties kind of like that that's a great that has just always been a great moment from 
[00:21:00]  even uh even your adolescence that getting those your two pointer fingers hooking those things  right in the top of any kind of pants or panties or something and then you know when that when that  ass comes up off the bed to help you out you know it's like ah right this is gonna happen it's gonna be  business you pull that down for the first time i remember about years ago though it was you know  kind of a world of hurt under there yeah it wasn't quite like it is now i cleaned up you know i 
[00:21:30]  remember buzz that whole big fucking patch there you can see it through the panties but you didn't  know any better because nobody was really no no i didn't we we didn't know any better like like  parents would talk about cigarette smoking we didn't have all the facts right that a big hairy  pussy was disgusting and got hair in your teeth we didn't know at that time we learned later you  didn't know there was another option yes just get rid of it that was it yeah that was always a 
[00:22:00]  great moment though god how fucking crazy you'd get just pull that down be like oh look the ass is  coming up she wants me to take these off she's not fucking smacking me and crying rape  i always prefer a skirt to go up really yeah much more than pants to come down i like a skirt to go  hiked up a little bit you open the legs open and you feel up the skirt oh that's the best this is the  constant battle of naked or semi-naked and it's gotta be a naked thing hi a naked thing and then 
[00:22:30]  bobby kelly walks in his strap for his bag i caught on the doorknob hi bobby i prefer um i don't mind  naked but i like i like the uh the skirt to get hiked up i like to go in that way i don't like to  have them just pull the skirt off i like a nice short skirt um is he talking about trannies again  no no no something where the balls are hanging down underneath the m the m line just admit i like 
[00:23:00]  that too just naked as opposed to fucking clothes he likes anthony's like i like when you could just  pull it we were talking about like that when you that first time when when you first start out your  sexual career when when uh yeah you hook your fingers at on the panties or the skirt or pants  or something and she lifts her ass up to let you know you could pull down and it's just like oh  that's that moment is like yes but i like the skirt going on more than that i prefer no the legs opening  and the skirt hiking like i like to see the pussy that way there's nothing better than a skirt with no 
[00:23:30]  panties i don't know there's nothing better oh i mean it's great don't get me wrong but i kind of  like when all of it's off and you get a good view of the whole thing just to know that like all night  long at the restaurant at the club all your fucking comic friends have probably seen your chick's  pussy like nine times not my wife but my chick is that good though i don't know it's kind of hot  just to know that she has no panties on jesus i like that too i was out with a woman once and she 
[00:24:00]  had god she had a fat pussy it was it was a massive giant and she was showing me under the table oh i  was out of my it's one of those things that's been burned in my brain  under the skirt yeah right right in get right in right through the right through those lips but  like i was trying to snap pictures of it and when i saw it like just fucking rest it was so big and 
[00:24:30]  fucking obscenely dirty that she was doing that i was fucking it's one of those things that makes me  weak to think about wow yeah that skirt with no fucking panties on man oh the whole mindset  is behind the fact that you kind of like that thing and i like fucking just everything off um  like everything off i like being able to look at you know like a pilot coming into the landing you  want to see the whole runway i like looking at everything from from that vantage point you know  i think it means you're more normal sexually in a weird way because like i fetishize it like uh you 
[00:25:00]  just like a naked chick that you want to just jam your fucking giant italian concho peep dick into  i i like something naughty about it or something inappropriate i would rather be like and  i don't know if it's so yeah you know i like tights like black tights really on a broad yeah  there's something about black tights that really if a girl has a dress on with those black tights  and then you you can pull the just the ass down a little bit so you can see the pussy yeah oh it's 
[00:25:30]  something like she's kind of tied up she can't move a little bit she can't walk right oh boy you know  what i mean are you like the hobbler i'm not a i'm not a stockings or tights or like pantyhose certain  stockings can look really good i like a good uh fishnet if it you know if it's appropriate right  something though up to mid mid thigh is good i don't like something like pantyhose i don't want

[00:37:00]  it's because you can't um you gotta be ready to go you can't just that i can i'm one and done i  can't i can't yeah especially with my wife oh no i'm kidding no really i mean you get so desensitized  to each other because i told we stopped walking around naked together we start we had to stop doing  certain things was that her suggestion here's a sweater i really don't i really don't know what 
[00:37:30]  she's i i think she's lying oh to herself yeah you know what i mean like i'm like i don't get what  you get girls are weird like that they can just fucking love love uh people love us why me oh  because my ain't seen dawn yeah she shouldn't fucking like me nobody should  but yeah no she's uh she looks really good and yeah you're a bit of a disaster lately 
[00:38:00]  but uh that's what that's what women do but but you know but stop and jerking off i haven't  watched porn you stop watching porn for a little bit and the first couple times in you're like  and then it quickly starts to unravel and go away and you're right really fast back to where you were  three weeks ago looking at some fucking hard shit more hard shit trying to find just somebody  with a mask and a gun and a girl really crying something that works for you sure but the first  couple you're like uh ah fuck you know you it's like uh it's like we need that first cigarette after 
[00:38:30]  you quit smoking for a long time it just tastes like shit it's like you know where that's headed  yeah but if you keep going yeah it goes away and all of a sudden it just tastes awesome but when you  when you quit porn and you go to have sex like or be sexual how long does it take to adjust because  i don't i wouldn't know if i wasn't playing with my nipples because i i literally would jerk off and  just fucking tweet on my nipple with my left thumb it's fucking awful really yeah it's like a  zone out ritual so weird it's weird yeah i i well sex was really good uh after i eat because you 
[00:39:00]  haven't had it it's like uh not eating salt not having salt in your diet right and then  and then and sugar comes in your mouth you're like  you would you would but then when you have when when you have like fruit when you take sugars and  stuff and then you have fruit and you haven't eaten and all of a sudden fruit is like  fucking ice cream right it's like holy shit great it's the same thing with uh 
[00:39:30]  fucking your girl fucking i guess so you realize what a mindset thing it is when you think all right  just the pure physical feeling of a chick shoving her hands down the front of your  pants grabbing your dick if it's your chick that you've been with for a long time  it doesn't feel the same but it's it is the same thing it's just a hand grabbing same same nerve  endings are being stimulated but if it's some let's say some girl you just fucking met in a bar that night 
[00:40:00]  it feels different feels there's nothing the physical part of it feels different though based  on just what's in your head so the first time a girl that you don't know grabs your cock  if they there's no i don't know if there's a better feeling in the world that i've ever felt  you're looking around like for the cops she reaches up 
[00:40:30]  great there's no better feeling yeah when they first grab it oh and and it really does show you  though that the whole the mind is so fucking wired into that because it's the same it's the same  physical thing but it feels completely different you get desensitized to anything though you're with  the same chick yeah it's just it's like it's not gonna work we shower together for the last five  years you walk in when i take a shit it's over johnny that means you're settling you're sacrificing 
[00:41:00]  something to have this relationship you're settling yeah well you gotta you gotta stop doing the normal  shit you have to stop doing and then the porn and plus what we do this girl flirting with you  all the fucking time even the flirt oh god when a girl flirts at you she sends an email and you're  like you know you can work it you know where this could go ah see you know where it could go yeah  and that's enough for you sometimes yeah that's too weak i mean it's not enough i mean i definitely 
[00:41:30]  want to fucking constantly cheat on everything everything the only thing i'm surprised at i never  want to drink or use drugs i it's shocking to me that i'm just with the food and and the sex and the  you know how fucked up i am with so many other things that i never said just fuck it let's just go  you shut off a floodgate and it just made streams everywhere else to go around that's all you did  that's right damn the booze and alcohol are all behind one damn you're right then there's 
[00:42:00]  fucking pussy juice and cum that's like a gravy potato chip river what's that i hate chip i hate him  i fucking hope he dies going around everything that's a good way to put it oh my rivers opened  up everywhere it's true it's really true man that that it's just when girls are coming on to you like  that you're out you're fucking gigging you're doing shit and they're coming up to you yeah you just  know you you won't do that you can't do it it's got to drive you fucking crazy i have an out though 
[00:42:30]  what a fucking slob you are as far as sexuality goes everything i do my wife's and my everybody  knows about my wife my act the podcast everybody knows so they'll always go well you know how's your  wife well you know how's they'll bring you know and i'll be like oh cool and it's kind of snapshot of  it uh-huh like you have that last fucking wow trigger oh oh it's the last safety net yeah you  can pull that fucking as you wait wait how's your wife yeah they know by name you're like 
[00:43:00]  fucking i'm out of here oh it's the last just shake bobby wake the fuck up yeah but if a girl was like  hey i don't give a fuck about anything i want to just fucking suck your dick in this hallway real quick  eesh it's hard yeah i would i don't know what i don't know what the fuck i'd have to call my wife  and this is purely is this okay honey can i do this listen i tried everything okay i have a picture  of her honey look look at her please this is just based on love for a woman while you're not doing 
[00:43:30]  that it's that's all it is it's a decision you made for her for her not for you you made it all you  make a decision for her because of the it's like a religion uh a marriage is like a religion it's a  it's a way of life so you're deciding to live this way under these rules uh for her for somebody else  uh for yourself too because it betters it betters your you want to live that style of life for that 
[00:44:00]  time because look i've lived this way my whole life i i did it um and now it's like okay i'm just  going to try this way now because like colin said you can do this you can do this way and and regret  it for the you never do this and say fuck it and just go fuck broads and do your thing and regret it  for the rest of your life that that one that you really did want to hang out got away or you can try  it and if it fucks up and it doesn't work which sometimes it does just fuck it go back to banging  broads that yeah but i it's all based everything why is everything based on sacrifice because it's also 
[00:44:30]  you you want her to sacrifice too it's almost like you know this girl is not out with other  guys like you don't do you really want to come home yes and yes but it goes i'd love to come i  don't want it but i fucking want it it's dirty i fucking fantasized just making love to her and  she's not talking and then i look up and i know why she's not talking it's a big fucking cuckoo  yeah but you imagine imagine if she just wasn't coming home for the night she got home at three in the  jim high-fives me hey oh man no but and like where were you like i was out and you know she 
[00:45:00]  was out fucking somebody and like you know he's better than like no guy wants to deal with that  no no but i'm saying i mean it's fun to turn i used that was used to be my thing back when i was  single that's when i really loved you yes oh just sharing i was a sharer dude bob was i was a  fucking sharer sharing is caring oh my god i was nothing hotter than a chick that likes you but you know  she's a fucking dirty pig you know she wants to fuck your friends too but they'll never admit it 
[00:45:30]  but then you get them to do it and you're like yeah yeah i could never do that with friends like  i could uh and i could no no i just couldn't let a girl pictures weird no but i couldn't i couldn't  bring a girl and say suck a friend's dick i could have her suck a stranger's dick but the friendship  thing mimi could you please go yeah he's dead powers is tense over there his legs are soaking in the pool  could you uh i could never do it with a buddy to see my buddy's dick it would be cool so and fun  to watch but i couldn't get turned on by it i used to say i used to set up scenarios back in the day 
[00:46:00]  with chicks where like my friend would come over i would tell my friend too neither one of them knew  that they knew i'd be like dude come over blah blah it's gonna happen just go with it and when i  when i say you gotta go just get the fuck out and i would set the chick up like look when he comes  over i'm gonna go to the bathroom i want you to you know fucking show him your pussy what the  fuck is going on i used to love those little scenarios and then just fucking i'd take my  dick out she starts sucking it and then i yeah he would come over and just take his dick out which

[00:49:00]  factor you won charlie you won you get the oompa loompas the chocolate and then we went up but  she was like go fuck yourself you would there was no winning it was just a test it was a test yeah well  you know what it is though it's we're so fucked i would love to go back sexually because i hear guys  talk like i can i just fuck my wife we fuck all the time and i'm like wow that's fucking amazing i  would love to be able to be that untainted with sex yeah where you know when you you don't even know 
[00:49:30]  about this other life or all this other you tell guys certain sex things and they go really what  you like that a lot of them are bullshitting i don't know about that and especially the part if  you're if you're with the same woman for a few years um i don't how do you keep that fresh yeah  but you gotta understand i mean most guys don't fuck the way we fuck this business ah this fucking  business this business re in the way we are with the drinking and all that our lives most a lot of  people don't have it was around hammered broads yeah well we have a freshly married man here who 
[00:50:00]  sam is a loyal guy i've been on the road with sam he doesn't he really is not a hound he's a  he's a regular dude what do you do to keep it interesting you've been the same girl seven  years he wears that shirt yeah she pretends to not be turned off it's like first day of school  third grade shirt exactly you bring your fucking little kicks lunchbox school bag she makes it  wear a fucking scrunchie so it looks like boy hair number one we don't what what's he laughing 
[00:50:30]  you don't like his listing okay like i ignored everything we were just oh yeah oh he just went  number one like a school teacher he'll do that no i don't uh we don't shit in front of each other we  don't shower together we don't do all that shitting i can understand showering i think you could shower  in front of each other not if it's purely to clean yourselves and it's got to be if it gets a sexy  shower that's one thing you there's a book called the kosha sutra and it talks about that because you 
[00:51:00]  when you desensitize yourself if you see your wife's tits all the time right because you change  in front of each other you shower together you're just lying around naked blah blah blah you don't  give a fuck about it right if you don't do that for a few weeks all of a sudden you'll see and i've  done it i've tried it all of a sudden you see your wife's tits like oh jesus those are fucking great  tits it does work i'm sure yeah it's probably yeah it's cool but when you're getting fucking pussies  texted to you and emailed to you and you're online it's kind of hard to not see a tit 
[00:51:30]  but i know what you're saying though again that's but okay so you know yeah i try to not have any  non-sexual nudity and stuff like that like you were saying yeah that's good and it does a lot  that's a good idea when you do get naked it's like oh my god i haven't seen i haven't seen  pussy or tits in a oh my in a while right and it's like you're connected to it if you're shitting in  front of each other and you're a married couple it's fucking over unless you're shitting on each  other i don't you rule i don't even know my wife pees yeah like we don't she doesn't i don't even 
[00:52:00]  fuck around with that and she can when i'm taking a shit at the beginning in the end what do you mean  she can't she can't be there at the beginning of the end at the first couple middle she can walk  into the middle when i'm reading oh no disgusting she has to grab something but not the beginning at the  first couple what's the difference and the end when i'm fucking peeking around when i'm no way 
[00:52:30]  i shut the door and lock it and turn the faucet on so she yeah me too as dirty as i am that's one  thing and i don't mind hearing about i remember my my ex texted me but she still turned me on despite  being like i didn't care that she should i knew but uh she texted me one time because i took her  fucking horrible dump right before i like she had to leave and she fucking texted me i was almost late  for work because of your fucking shit smell like she couldn't go in the bathroom she couldn't go  in the bathroom and brush her teeth because my shit stuck up the bathroom i win i was so happy there 
[00:53:00]  is a horror feeling when you're in a hotel room or something and you realize you gotta take a dump  and you're like i i don't know what to do and then you gotta do it so you chance it and then she  tries to like get up after you come out you're like no and you close the bathroom door yeah you  gotta time it with a shower because first of all what are you saying you're going to do where she  won't think you're shitting you're shitting right like you can't go like i'll be right back and then  you turn the faucet on you got because i take a 25 minute shit i like to shit but then she gets up 
[00:53:30]  and you're like oh god the bathroom door is closed wait i want to talk to you for a second  she should know like don't fucking put me in that position where you're getting up and walking  into the bathroom right after has that happened i came out uh yeah it's like ah i get so embarrassed  i remember i was with uh i was with the one girl years ago we were in a fucking hotel and  and i had to take a dump and i was i was bad i went down into the hotel lobby to take a dump i said

[01:05:00]  Oh, Mimi Beardsley.  Oh, Mimi Beardsley.  Sirius XM. This is the O.P. and Anthony Show. 
[01:05:30]  No.  Never loved my wife.  Welcome back to the show.  Welcome back. Welcome to Bob.  Me and Bobby are talking.  Me and Bob Kelly are yapping about fucking marriage.  You never loved your wife.  No.  I might have thought I did at one point before we were married.  But, uh, no. 
[01:06:00]  No.  I fucking love my wife.  I like, I'm a fucking pussy.  She was in my way.  She was a fucking blockade.  Yeah.  She was one of those things where you're driving and you're fucking, those do not back up spikes.  They were in front of my car.  Those steel fucking tubes that come out of the ground.  Yes, that was her.  I was talking to Jess yesterday about the conversations we were having and how, like, you know, you thought that I might have this sort of, that it's kind of looming over my head in case I start making money or whatever. 
[01:06:30]  Right.  And she was like, poor Anthony.  Oh, see how nice that is.  Poor Anthony.  She's the nicest girl in the world.  Yeah.  It's ridiculous.  Sam's chick.  Yes.  Yeah, she's a nice girl.  She's very nice.  She's pretty, too.  Thank you.  I said that and she just has sympathy.  What are you thinking of me?  It's a nice thing for you to say.  I have contempt.  You do.  About that fucking, you know, I watch your money, blah, blah, I'm all jaded.  And she just has sympathy. 
[01:07:00]  She just feels bad about what it did to you.  Oh.  You'll be back, though.  I guarantee in a few years you'll meet, you'll meet, you're going to meet somebody and you're  going to be back in the fucking mix.  And you'll be one of those guys who.  Fortune teller Bob.  Hang on, let me finish the fortune.  You're going to, you're going to, you're going to get a chick and you're not going to get married.  No.  You're just going to be together forever.  I'm not getting a fucking, I'm not getting married.  Yeah, I don't know.  I could, you know, obviously I'm not counting out having a very long term nice relationship. 
[01:07:30]  She'll be 80, she'll be 28.  Exactly.  So it'll work out.  It'll work out.  The timing will work out.  But married, I could never see myself getting into that fucking situation of marriage.  Right.  Ever again.  No.  Just for me, from what I fucking went through and shit, I don't see any upside.  But if you're with a girl, right, and you have a girlfriend, you're fucking, it's the  same thing as being married.  You're not supposed to cheat.  You're not supposed to fuck other broads.  You're supposed to go to dinner with her, all your friends, I mean, it's the same shit. 
[01:08:00]  There's a big fucking difference.  You can tell her to beat it.  It's a huge difference.  It's a huge difference.  Grab her by the elbow and fucking goon hand her out of your fucking jacuzzi.  It's a giant difference.  And then the financial responsibility after a marriage is, that's always, it's just always  over your fucking head.  Don't need that shit.  Ever.  Oh, do I just, look, I'm all bleh.  I get all bleh talking about marriage.  Yeesh.  Lucky I came to your wedding. 
[01:08:30]  Those things disgust me.  There are differences.  After the wedding, all the money that we got, it was like, for the first time, that was  ours.  Like, until we got married, it was like, well, I have a job and you have a job, so we have  our separate, you know, things going on.  Right, now it's all marital assets.  Yeah.  So you have one account now?  No, we both, we still have our separate accounts, but now we also have a joint account.  Oh, well, wait a minute.  Why don't you put some money in that joint account?  That kind of bugged me when I bought my apartment and I looked over and my wife was signing 
[01:09:00]  something, and I was like, what is she signing?  What the fuck is her name going on something for?  And they were like, well, because you guys are, and I go, well, fucking what?  And she's on the account.  We have a joint account.  She's the co-fucking something.  Yeah, that joint account worked out great for me.  No, it didn't work out well for you.  Oh, it didn't?  That's what he meant.  Oh, 40 large.  40 large she fucking took out. 
[01:09:30]  She took four grand out of the fucking...  Four T.  Oh, 40.  I thought you said four.  Now, why is 40 less obscene?  $40,000 is a lot of money.  I know.  But you said four grand.  I was saying that was a lot of money to me.  Like, I was joking.  That's what you were doing.  I didn't even...  What the fuck?  My acting is good.  The worst part of that story is that you went to get your half.  You were only going to take half.  I was.  And then she had already taken her half and your half. 
[01:10:00]  Went in there and was just like, yeah, I'll show her.  I'm taking half this fucking money.  I went in there with my withdrawal slip.  I had to tell you, because it's a lot of money.  20 grand I was taking out.  So I had to talk to a manager.  You know, I'm taking out half of my assets.  Oh, so that'll be what?  23 cents?  Can you say, I'll be the bank manager and you say that to me.  Go ahead.  I'm taking out.  I'm taking out half of my assets.  Hang on one second.  I'm sorry.  One second.  You hear from a room far away. 
[01:10:30]  This motherfucker.  Oh, he must have been laughing.  Well, I'm looking at the balance here.  And yeah, that account's already been closed.  Wait, what?  But now I have no money.  And you never got that back in the settlement, right?  Why would a guy that worked and put money in the bank account and had a wife take it out,  why would he get it back?  For nine years, you had to pay a woman.  It's fucking sickening out of money. 
[01:11:00]  On top of that, I had to pay after she got fucking 40 grand.  And it's like all of this, the way you guys get fucking raped in these divorces.  That's why people are shitting on marriage so much.  Yes.  Because a lot of people get married, they don't want to get married, but they can't get divorced  because they can't afford it, so they just cheat.  So they cheat.  Fucking ridiculous.  Yep.  Fuck that.  Never again.  Well, I think...  The Holocaust.  Never again.  It took me 12 years to get married, right? 
[01:11:30]  It took me 12 years to get married.  Right, yeah, I do remember it.  So it took me a lot of fucking, you know, being a dummy to finally get to the point where  I'm like, I'm going to make this decision to live this type of lifestyle.  But you went the other way.  You just got married.  Yeah.  And then now you're going backwards.  Yeah.  Like, you're going to be like, fuck it, I'm not doing that anymore.  Yeah, yeah.  I can't imagine doing that.  I just can't imagine fucking committing like that, fucking contracts drawn up. 
[01:12:00]  What if you're dating a girl and you dated her for like three or four years and she was  like, it means a lot to me.  I really want to get married.  Let's say you knew what this was getting into it.  That...  Yeah, why does it mean a lot to you?  What about it?  Yeah, change...  How about you change what you value?  Yeah.  It means a lot to me to not get married.  You know how many girls I could have married, though?  Like, I mean, just the fuck-ups.  And you did.  No, I mean, like, all the fuck-ups I had before, like, before dawn, all the chicks that it 
[01:12:30]  was like, oh my God, this is the one and I could have got it, oh, just the disasters  it would have just fucking, oh God.  So many fucking nightmares.  I think of the girls I could have been with if I didn't get married.  See?  When I wasn't, when I was married and I was doing radio up in Massachusetts and there were  so many fucking girls at these events that we would do, and I just was like, no, no,  man, wear my ring, because if I, God forbid, I took it off once, she'd fucking be like, where's 
[01:13:00]  your ring?  Why is it on?  Why is it on your ring?  Ugh.  And I keep it on and I'm fucking holding, like, it's like I'm throwing up gang signs  trying to fucking hide my ring with my other fingers.  I'm doing a West Side fucking thing.  Oh, I hated it.  You stunk, right, being married?  I was the worst.  See, I don't know, I was actually good because I didn't cheat, but I hated being married and  I couldn't stand who I was married to.  I don't know if I'm marriage material.  I think about it, but I'm like, I just don't think so. 
[01:13:30]  I don't think so.  I don't think so either.  Not in this country.  People change when they get older, I guess they say that, but I...  Florentine's getting married, man.  Yeah.  If fucking Jim is doing it, and Jim doesn't cheat on his girl.  Jim's a...  Why not?  What else am I doing?  Yeah, but Jim doesn't.  What else am I doing?  Such a great Florentine.  Do you take this woman to be a lovely widow?  Why not?  What else am I doing?  Yeah.  Yeah.  What do you get to do?  Do you ever think about that?  I guess so. 
[01:14:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, I've thought about it, but...  Are you going to be 50 and be alone?  Maybe.  What's wrong with you?  55 and something happens, you get sick, nobody's there to take care of you?  So what?  Oh, your other friends...  That's what money's for.  Yeah, one woman to fucking...  One woman to fucking resent me and wait for me to die so she can have my apartment.  Yeah.  That was great.  I was fucking...  When I had that pertussis or whatever the fuck it was, I'm just bedridden, all laid 
[01:14:30]  up with fucking medicine all over the room, coughing like a motherfucker, and I had  a fine Canadian girl over there taking care of my every need.  Your every need.  It was wonderful.  Yeah.  Thank you.  I'd be like, could I have some water?  It was great.  She was fucking fantastic.  And she didn't get sick, right?  No, it's Canadian blood.  I don't know what's in it.  No, a pot.  It's crazy.  It's all that weed. 
[01:15:00]  Kills everything.  Sometimes I do think about if I didn't get married, I'd probably still have my apartment.  I mean, my apartment, if I wasn't married, and oh God, if me and Jim, if I had my place  and you had a place...  Got married.  How much fucking awful shit we'd be doing together?  I'd do it alone.  I know, but we'd do it together.  You wouldn't like most of the shit I do.  What are you talking about?  Something that you might put.  Something that you make fun.  Has he grown?  Like, out of... 
[01:15:30]  Oh, Jesus.  Grown out of it.  You've got to grow into that shit.  You can't grow out of it.  Once you're into it, you can't come home.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You can't come home.  No, but you don't think Bobby would be, like, into...  No, just the directions I've gone in.  Oh, it's a little different than when you guys were hanging?  Just more severe.  More severe.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  A little bit.  Nothing crazy.  I thought you went the other way, because sometimes, you know, you can go really fucked  up, but even when you have fetishes and stuff, they can be stupid little ones. 
[01:16:00]  Like, you can get obsessed with massages or, you know, like, kind of okay ones.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I suppose.  I mean, they're just so cute, and they're small.  Are you my friend, Jack?  My friend, Jack.  Just does nothing for me.  Friend, Jack.  I hate those little fucking monsters.  Kids.  Sandusky loves them, apparently.  He's in big trouble. 
[01:16:30]  What was his opening?  His defense was, like, other coaches have showered with kids, too, or something?  I heard it, but I heard about it, but I didn't hear it.  Yeah, they're making these excuses for him, like, trying to make it seem like, what?  What?  This is...  No, everyone does this.  Everyone thlocks their nuts against a young boy's ass in the shower.  What?  No, they don't.  And what was the NBC fucking audio?  Like, they're saying that there's a part of the interview.  I don't think NBC protected him, but they edited part of their interview out.  Yeah, yeah, for some reason.  But they sit for time.  But you can't do that. 
[01:17:00]  Why would you interview the guy and only air some of it?  And they didn't air something that was pretty fucking scathing.  I never got the prison showers, though, in a high school.  When you're building showers, just put a stall in.  Right.  Why do you have to have an open room like we're cattle?  Yeah, so the guards can see in.  There's no reason.  There's no fucking reason to fucking have that open prison shower.  Just get, like, a bunch of stalls so people can...  Everyone's very self-conscious at that age, and you don't want to fucking be showering.  You know, you haven't matured yet, and there's some guy in there that's, like, fucking got 
[01:17:30]  a 12-inch dick and hairy mess cousin-it dick.  Do you rub your cock before you go into the shower just so it hangs a little bit?  Fluffing for men.  Yeah.  Play on this, Bobby.  I want to hear if this is the audio.  I don't know if this is the stuff that they're looking for, but apparently there was NBC stuff.  I did it, Danny.  Oh, of course, what?  It's drizzling out.  Prosecutors have wrested their case against the former Penn State assistant football coach. 
[01:18:00]  I hate these lights.  It came after more emotional testimony and a decision to drop one of the charges against  him.  David Lee Miller is live at the courthouse in Bellefont, Pennsylvania.  What's happening there, David?  Well, just a short time ago that the defense began its case.  They put on the stand as their first witness, a coach that worked with Jerry Sandusky and  Sandusky actually played with at Penn State.  His name, Richard Anderson.  Essentially, Anderson told the jury John that Jerry Sandusky had a very demanding schedule, 
[01:18:30]  as did all the coaches, and it would be very, very difficult for him to have committed so  much time to young boys.  Because of his busy schedule?  Stop it.  Also, this morning, the prosecution decided to drop one charge, the charge of endangering  the welfare of a child.  That charge was dropped on a technicality, and we also heard a very powerful testimony  from the mother of one of the alleged victims, who explained that... 
[01:19:00]  This is not...  Had to wash his blood-stained undies.  Yeah, forget it.  I don't think this is the...  I wanted to know about the new...  Yeah, that clip.  They're saying there's one clip where he says something like, uh, they said, uh, Costas  fucking grilled him, man.  Yeah.  And they cut this part of the interview out, like, because he was saying that he helped  all these kids, and Costas was saying that this is...  Isn't this a classic MO of pedophiles?  Mm-hmm.  To groom them and help them.  And he goes, so it's entirely possible that you could have helped boy A in some way that 
[01:19:30]  was not objectionable, while horribly taking advantage of boy B, C, D, and E.  Isn't that possible?  Like, Costas nailed this motherfucker, man.  He really did a great interview.  And this is one part that they didn't even air.  Yeah.  But, like, uh, like, you know, he was saying, well, I've helped so many young boys.  Doesn't matter.  And, boy, Costas cut off any fucking exits...  Yeah, yeah.  ...that he had built into his argument.  You helped the ugly ones.  Yeah.  Yeah, the fat ones.  Yeah.  It's always the worst when somebody does that, and they figure out... 
[01:20:00]  You go, I forgot that.  Damn it.  Shit.  I could have fucked this one and not that one.  Well, it says, couldn't you have damaged boy B, C, D, and E, and Costas asked Sandusky.  And he said that he gave an unusual reply.  Well, you might think that.  Well, I'm guessing he said, well, you might think that.  I don't know.  In terms of my relationship with so many, many young people, I would guess that there are  many young people who would come forward. 
[01:20:30]  Many more young people who would come forward and say that my methods and what I had done  for them made a very positive impact on their life.  And I didn't go around seeking out every young person for sexual needs that I've helped.  There are many that I didn't have...  I hardly had any contact with whom I had slept with and who I had helped in many, many ways.  Wow.  I had helped in many, many ways.  Yeah.  The prosecution wants that tape.  It's almost like he's saying, well, yeah, I fucked a few.  Because there are many I didn't have, dash, I hardly had any contact with who I've helped 
[01:21:00]  in many, many ways.  Well, maybe he means emotional contact or not.  He says many I didn't have contact with.  It means there are some you did.  Yeah, it's like the priest didn't fuck every altar boy.  Right, right.  He didn't fuck the fat one.  That's kind of what he's saying.  The little Puerto Rican one wasn't his thing.  I don't know.  It doesn't look good, though.  Yeah, the prosecution's done.  I guess the defense trying to say he didn't have time to molest boys. 
[01:21:30]  His busy schedule.  There's always time.  How busy are you?  That's not helping his case, Uncle Paul.  You got to take time and smell the roses.  Uncle Paul fucking really grossed me out the other night.  That little brown rose.  He said you put the diaper on.  Oh, you got to pretend you're changing him.  That explains why you're standing up there in that position. 
[01:22:00]  That's just the cellar.  He's so mad.  Lift that little legs.  It's fucking terrible.  So what do you think?  He's in quite a jam.  Fuck yeah, man.  I don't think there's any defense that's going to get him out of this trouble that he's in.  So, yeah, good.  Good for him.  Yeah.  Take a hike to jail.  This is money I don't mind spending.  I don't mind going after a guy like this.  But the fact that they wasted millions of dollars on Roger Clem, that really fucking annoys me. 
[01:22:30]  Oh, his perjury case.  Gave a fuck.  Yeah, they actually found him not guilty for perjury because he had said he didn't do, what, steroids?  I think so, yeah.  That was it.  And then somebody came forward and said he did do steroids, but no one was ever on trial for steroids.  It's always that perjury thing that gets you.  So, I don't know.  I bet if it was just Joe Schmo, not amazing pitcher.  It's so funny that nobody in baseball is doing steroids now, though. 
[01:23:00]  You haven't heard.  It was the biggest, hottest thing for a minute.  Huge scandal.  And now it's like, yeah, they're back to fucking using steroids.  Do you think they are?  Fucking absolutely.  Who do you think is jacking that ball because they're fucking shooting steroids?  I think they're getting, not as many people are doing it now.  Even if you look at wrestling, there's not, everybody isn't a huge guy anymore.  They actually, the guys that are popular are just regular dudes.  Like, they're not all fucking jacked up.  They're more personality now than not everybody's doing.  Even in the UFC, they're... 
[01:23:30]  Giant muscles.  Yeah, like, you know, not everybody's fucking Brock Lesnar.  Even Brock isn't doing steroids.  You can tell he's thinned out.  But, yeah, of course they're doing steroids.  So, in baseball, though, like, who...  There aren't any of those fucking...  Like, Mark McGuire was a prime example of somebody doing steroids.  So funny.  It's just fucking giant.  Nobody said anything, though.  Fucking, his arms were ridiculous.  He had acne like he was 13.  Yeah, on his ears. 
[01:24:00]  Yeah, on his ears, he fucking was belting the ball.  And then, like, two years after he retired, they show him, and he's got, like, granny glasses on.  He's emaciated.  From McGuire?  So funny, though, is that just, like, in the five-year period, guys were hitting 900 home runs.  It just hit, we're like, yeah!  Woo!  It was great for baseball.  It got better and better.  We watched the home run derby, and you're like, what the fuck?  And we were just jacked up on this.  Steroids brought baseball back. 
[01:24:30]  Oh, my God.  It was, they should be praising people that did steroids.  So, so, McGuire.  The race in 96 or 95?  95.  And then Barry fucking annihilated it.  Yeah.  I mean, it's, you're like, holy fuck.  You used to watch those home run derbies and be like, what?  Remember the one at Fenway Park with McGuire?  And he just fucking, like, 770 just out of the fucking park.  Oh, they were going over Axis, the club out there.  It's exactly what you want to see.  It was like the future. 
[01:25:00]  It was like the future.  The future!  That was fucking crazy, man.  And then it's all, and then they fucking chilled out.  And I bet you they're doing it now, but, like, a lot of the UFC guys do it to recover.  To recover.  To get back in the game.  Not everybody uses it to actually get an advantage.  Some of them you just use to actually repair shit and become better to get back to where you were.  That's what some of these guys are saying they took it for initially anyway, was to just keep their shit together. 
[01:25:30]  I couldn't imagine being a fucking athlete and playing for a lot of years, and then somebody giving you something, and you're like, dude, I, working out and all this bullshit, it was awesome today.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I fucking hated it last week.  Like, and now it's the shit, you're like, I'll fucking take this.  Imagine something, like, as a comic, imagine being able to take something and you kill, I mean, fucking destroy the room every night.  Yeah, imagine there's a Jim Norton pill.  Putting his sexy face on. 
[01:26:00]  You kill, but then at the end of the night, you're just alone, shaking, rubbing your nipples, jerking off in a corner.  With your little ball bag.  Yeah, it shrinks, and you can't cum a lot, just one little drop comes out.  You're belting women in the face.  If it comes out of your eye like a tear.  Yeah, to be able to have something like that.  Nah, I'd fucking do it.  It makes you a super athlete.  I don't care if athletes do it or not.  Who gives a fuck?  I would love for them to do it.  Congress is involved with this shit. 
[01:26:30]  I think in fighting, I don't believe it in fighting, you should be able to do it because that's an unfair advantage.  If some guy actually is just training and, I mean, you're actually fighting another human being.  It's not baseball or fucking basketball, you know.  Like you could physically be fucked up.  Yeah, you're physically going to get fucking choked out and almost killed by a guy who's on a roids.  That makes sense.  Okay.  You know what I mean?  Especially with the heavyweights.  With football, though, where there's fucking, you know, physical contact.  What do you think about them doing it in football? 
[01:27:00]  They all know the rules.  I mean, they should all do it.  I think football, fuck it.  You want to do it?  Go ahead.  I mean.  Yeah, but that's almost like your thing with boxing because, let's say there's this fucking monster charging after the little quarterback.  Get a monster.  Get a fucking monster on your team.  Yeah.  Go get a, that's what they do anyways.  They go get a fucking bigger monster.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I saw that movie with Sandra Bullock and that fucking monster walking on the street in the rain.  David, uh, what was his real name? 
[01:27:30]  Or something.  But when you're fighting a guy, if you look at Junior Dos Santos or even Cain Vlasquez and then you look at fucking Overeem, there's a big fucking difference.  You look at Brock.  I mean, Frank Mir had to put on 20 pounds of muscle just to fight Brock the second time and still didn't matter.  Yeah.  Uh, and you get these, uh, heavyweight, uh, you can tell that Cain Vlasquez doesn't do steroids.  He's just regular big fucking guy.  Yeah.  And then you look at, you know, uh, Alistair Overeem, every muscle, he's fucking ginormous. 
[01:28:00]  And then you look at him like six years ago and he looks like you.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's, it's, it's, the difference is it's fucking roids.  Yeah.  He says it's horse meat because he's fucking Dutch.  He just eats like fucking big shanks of horse meat.  Really?  Yeah.  Fucking animal horse meat?  Oh, you can go to the fucking, in Amsterdam, you can go to a supermarket and you gotta be careful because they have right next to the ham and the turkey. 
[01:28:30]  It's just a horse.  Horse meat?  Yeah, they eat horse meat, man.  Did you have some?  No, I wouldn't fucking.  No?  I'd try it, but it's, it looks just red, the bloody.  Yeah?  Yeah, it's very, uh, but the steak, the steak actually looked good.  I've seen him eating a steak.  Horse steak?  It just looked like a steak.  It looked like a fucking bloody steak.  It's quite gamey like deer.  Why does it have such a bad rap?  Like, people don't like fucking, the idea of horse meat.  Well, because we, they're almost like our pet.  You know, a horse is a pet, like a dog.  And they're not like that over there?  Over there, no. 
[01:29:00]  Those fucking Europeans will.  They don't care about the horses?  They don't chop up anything.  Americans do have a love affair with the horse, don't they?  I'm the dog.  Oregon.  Yeah, yeah, dogs.  Yeah, horse meat is just regular.  Yeah, there it is.  It looks like fucking.  Oh, man, that looks very lean.  Yeah, it looks good, right?  Boy, horses are lean, aren't they?  Yeah.  He eats a lot of horse meat?  Yeah.  Fuck yeah.  I bet it smells, though.  But that's what he says he does.  I would picture the meat would smell like a horse.  I don't know why.  No, a cow doesn't smell.  I know, but I just think it's like, smells like a sweaty horse.  Yeah, you figure you're gonna pet it and, yeah. 
[01:29:30]  Oh, yeah.  He's a big.  Concho Pete tube steak.  Concho Pete.  Concho Pete ruled.  Oh.  That was Anthony's horse.  I love Concho Pete.  Well, it was actually a Kenny Meyer's horse.  Oh.  Kenny Meyer's.  One time, Concho Pete was walking around in his stall and his giant dick was hanging out  and Kenny Meyer's looked over and he was like, dang, Concho Pete never looked better.  Like, he just loved, like, looking at Concho Pete with his dick out. 
[01:30:00]  Because he used to get money for having Concho Pete fuck the other horses.  Oh, really?  Yeah, yeah.  So he loved it.  Big giant bell for a head of the dick.  It was like a giant bell on the end.  Clang, clang.  It just comes out slimy.  Concho Pete was a crazy horse.  Just hopping up on the other ones.  Blah.  Blah.  Blah.  Blah.  Blah.  Blah.  Blah.  Blah.  Making noises.  The dick's just going, ch-cunk, ch-cunk, trying to find the hole.  And the foot comes in.  Blah.  Fire hose. 
[01:30:30]  They never had erection problems, did they, horses?  No, those horses.  Horses come quick, too, right?  Dumb geldings, though.  They have to chop the balls off and stuff.  And this little dick comes.  Blah.  Just comes out of the sheath.  Blah.  Oh, it's soft.  Yeah.  It doesn't get hard.  Why do they make geldings?  So it's not as crazy.  Like, a stallion's like a fucking madman horse.  Wow.  Gelding is a lot easier to ride and brake and shit like that.  They don't get all feisty when they're around a horse in heat.  How do they cut the balls of a horse?  They just...  There's a couple of ways. 
[01:31:00]  They twist it and then bite it.  No, they don't knock them out.  Jimmy Jackson used to...  No, you rope them around those legs.  You tip them over.  And then you take a...  He used to just take a buck knife, cut the bottom of the bag off,  and the balls would just come falling right out.  And then he'd cut the cords on them,  and then take pine tar,  and just slap pine tar over the wound and let them up.  And then get a wiffle ball bat and have a nice game.  Yeah, yeah.  Would they kick and scream?  Well, they were not happy about it.  They wouldn't make noise. 
[01:31:30]  They weren't screaming or anything.  Oh, God.  Yeah, it was just weird.  Did you cut the balls out and put pine...  Would they ever die from the wound?  Mm-mm.  None of Jimmy Jackson's.  But then there was one that would...  They would also take an elastic band very tight...  Can't they not?  ...and wrap it around it and would just die.  It would just turn black and fall off.  That's got to hurt, right?  And fall off.  You would think.  I did that with mine.  With your balls?  Yeah, just one.  I made it into a keychain.  Oh, this is at least a doctor.  I made it into a little baby voodoo doll. 
[01:32:00]  Yeah, this is like a technical...  This is real.  Would he at least numb them, though?  No.  That's terrible.  He would just lay them down and cut their balls off.  And then every time they did something to an animal,  it was like, well, he doesn't mind.  Really?  Because he'd be like, doesn't that hurt him?  No, he doesn't care.  He doesn't mind.  You lived in a farm with horses.  Well, it was like a...  Not really a farm.  It was kind of just a bunch of horses we had for riding.  Jimmy Jackson had a bunch of horses.  A few cows.  You can't ride a... 
[01:32:30]  Like in the westerns, they'll ride for fucking hours.  You can only ride a horse at top speed for a little bit, right?  Oh, yeah, at top speed.  But you can walk them around for a while.  Really?  Yeah, they won't fuck around.  They'll just...  As long as they're fed and have some water, they're fine.  For hours?  Yeah.  Danny, are they going to show the balls coming off?  Oh, man.  You want to see that?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, that's sick.  But I want to see when they get a pain injection.  That's got to be terrible.  Without a pain injection?  Or you want to see it with? 
[01:33:00]  Fuck, yeah.  I want to see it with, man.  I can't watch.  Oh, God.  What is that?  Oh, it's his...  Yeah, his little legs are up in the air.  You got to have that thing.  He's right over the balls.  Danny, the words.  Oh, they just did it.  Look.  Oh, I can't watch.  Oh, okay.  I can't watch.  Possibly.  I can't watch.  Keep your arms away.  Oh, poor horse.  Oh.  Look at all the veins in the horse.  Oh, God.  I'm not watching that.  Oh, he's slicing that fucking...  He'll keep his eyes open, always.  He'll keep his eyes open. 
[01:33:30]  Yeah.  You're cutting my balls off.  I want to see you cutting my balls off.  All right.  Yeah, so I know who to step on.  See, I can't look either, Bobby.  No way.  I'm not watching that.  Look at that.  No.  Why would you want to see...  You like that shit.  You like fucking...  No, it's disgusting.  The horse has good thighs, though.  It does, right?  The inner thigh.  It looks silly on its back.  It does.  Horses look silly on their back with their little hooves up in the air.  Oh, did you hear that?  Their hooves.  Oh, my God.  What did you hear?  That must hurt.  Cracking?  What's cracking in there?  His ball just got chopped off.  Oh, God. 
[01:34:00]  Why?  Is that horse knocked out or...  I don't know.  His fucking eyes are open.  He's looking at him.  He's got a local.  He would put pine tar on there?  Yeah, he would just slap pine tar on the wound to keep it clean.  Jesus.  Would he ever clean it again or no?  No.  Is that...  Like a railroad track?  Yeah.  He'd be fine.  He'd just fucking walk around and he'd be good after that.  How long did it take him to heal?  Like a week.  It wasn't bad.  Then he'd put him back on the rent string to have to trot around some fat fucking tourist. 
[01:34:30]  It's so funny how they figured that shit out.  I know.  Like, when did that happen?  When did a...  Like, was it just some Indian just cut it off with a fucking sharp rock and used his wife's  fucking ponytail to tie it off?  I bet it wasn't the Indians.  I bet the fucking cowboys are the first ones to do that.  Maybe the Spaniards.  Spanish cowboys, right?  Spaniard!  Spaniard!  That's where you got the name, the Crackers.  You're good, Spaniard.  You're fat good.  I don't know.  It just seems like an awful thing to do. 
[01:35:00]  I've seen it done.  It's not fucking pretty.  What do you do with the nuts?  He'd just throw them to the dog.  Would he really?  They would eat it?  He would just throw them and the dogs would be like...  Just eat up the fucking horse nuts.  And that same dog is kissing you an hour later.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Give me kisses.  It's the same as a chick sucking you an asshole.  That's true.  Imagine the horse looking over and seeing his balls getting eaten by the dog that he hates.  Hey, if you were smart, you wouldn't fucking be a horse. 
[01:35:30]  What?  That must be nuts, though, to fucking see.  Just be like, dude, we were hanging, I gave you a ride yesterday, went to the pond.  Do you think a horse would actually be able to be fucking put down on the ground like that  with his little legs up if he knew it was going to happen?  It's a horse.  You'd kick everyone's fucking face in.  You don't think horses know?  No, they don't.  You don't think a horse looks over and goes, those are my nuts right there?  Maybe at the last minute he'll know.  Yeah.  I can go, oh, shit, they cut my balls off. 
[01:36:00]  But beforehand, they just think it's a fun little game.  Oh, look, they're going to rub my belly.  They're rolling me over to scratch my tummy.  Oh, look, it's the guy who likes to brush me.  Hey, what's that?  That must be a new brush.  That's a sharp brush.  This is going to feel good.  Yeah, that must be the shook my stomach with.  And get all the dead skin off.  Hey, why are you tying my legs?  Oh, it's terrible.  Herbie the horse just doesn't get it?  He doesn't get it.  He doesn't know what's happening to him.  Hey!  Hey, wait a minute. 
[01:36:30]  What are you doing back there?  What are you doing?  I don't like this.  Hey, what are the dogs eating?  Can I have some?  Yeah, give me some of that stuff.  Oh, it's your balls, dummy.  Yeah.  You hear about that fucking Chinese dude that, the Japanese dude that sold his penis?  What?  He sold his dick on eBay.  I think it was eBay.  You can't buy body parts on eBay.  On the internet.  He sold his dick.  You can eat it.  Stop.  I swear to God.  $2,500 a pop. 
[01:37:00]  And they cooked his dick.  Cooked his dick and people ate it.  What made his dick so fucking great?  I don't know.  His Japanese, what did he get, like $5,000?  He sold, you know, two portions.  He sold, it was $2,500 a portion.  Yeah, that's what I'm saying.  He got two portions.  There was five people and they ate his cock and one guy didn't show up.  He bought it but didn't show up.  Oh.  Ugh.  What?  Well, he cut his own dick off there.  He cut his dick off. 
[01:37:30]  Oh, it was fresh?  Cut it off there.  It was fresh cock.  Fresh dick?  And then, no, I don't know if he did it there, but he cut his dick off and then they cooked  it and the chef prepared it in a fucking...  And, um, like food and they fucking ate it.  It was a dinner.  Certain people would eat my dick for free.  We'd be there for weeks.  No.  You...  I'd have to fucking get Ziploc bags.  What's this?  Just, we'd have to make it into other stuff.  Fucking Anthony's mac and cheese dick.  Anthony's meatloaf.  His name is something. 
[01:38:00]  Anthony Pizza.  Oh, my God.  A Japanese man who had his genitals removed, cooked and served them for paying dinner party  guests.  Um, this was London.  He was, uh, he's asexual.  He voluntarily underwent the surgery to have them removed.  Surgery.  He, uh, took his frozen penis and scrotum from the hospital and organized a grim party.  Does a frozen penis shrink like it is if it's attached to you?  Well, if it's his, would it really be noticeable?  I don't know.  No, his name wasn't Japanese. 
[01:38:30]  He was Mao something.  Mao.  Mao.  According to, he, uh, charged guests around 160 pounds per person, it's not 2,500, to  eat his severed genitals.  Oh, it was in Tokyo.  I'm sorry.  It was in Tokyo, yeah.  Uh, they were garnished with mushrooms and parsley.  Mushrooms.  Get it?  Mushroom.  Get it?  Yeah.  Of course.  Oh, my God.  Guests sat down to listen to piano recital as they ate an organ and take part in the panel  discussion.  I think he, they said, why are you doing this?  And then he says, I don't know, why are you eating this? 
[01:39:00]  And they all shot themselves.  What the fuck?  He cooked the genitals himself and he was supervised by a chef.  In a tweet, he offered to cook his penis for guests for 800 pounds.  However, he ultimately decided to split the meal between six guests.  Offering my male genitals, full penis, testes, and scrotum as a meal for 100,000 yen in  Japanese.  The organs were surgically removed at age 22.  I was tested to be free of venereal diseases.  The organs were of normal function.  I was not receiving female hormone treatment. 
[01:39:30]  First interested, buyer will get them.  I will also consider selling to a group.  I should have bought them and just kicked them down the street and laughed.  To a group.  We'll prepare and cook as the buyer requests.  At his chosen location.  If you have questions, please contact me.  70 people attended the event.  Five people tucked into Mao's genitalia.  The rest of them ate beef or crocodile.  What shithead?  Crocodile.  You fucking assholes.  That would have been a great iron chef. 
[01:40:00]  Today's special ingredient, dick.  Dick.  Dick.  He posted pictures of the event on his blog.  Oh my god.  He took them down.  Oh, privacy considerations.  Oh, well.  He, uh, oh no, they had to sign a waiver so that he wasn't responsible that they got sick  after eating his cock.  Sick of my dick, yeah.  You got fucking food poisoning.  There's nothing against the law about it.  He's an illustrator.  He had, who also had his nipples removed.  As an asexual, his genitalia will not be replaced with artificial female ones.  He's asexual. 
[01:40:30]  He must have, boy.  Talking about what childhood rape did he go through.  Yeah.  His nipples and everything.  Yeah, take over the golf.  Why do you get, but your penis also has a function as a urinary fucking thing.  You know, here's the thing, though.  He's fucked, but the people who fucking ate his dick, I think are worse than this fucking  living.  Who the fuck's going to pay to eat a guy's cock?  Is it maybe people like with terminal illness that are going, maybe eating a dick will cure  me.  Dumb Japanese who think fucking tiger bone is going to help you.  Yeah, yeah.  Shark cartilage. 
[01:41:00]  Things like that.  They, they, they, they just give you a good, uh, you fucking good after eating my cock.  Make of the number one fucky fucky, number one the fucky fucky.  You eat, uh, uh, Mr. Cock.  But the thing is, there was a, some of, they hired a piano player.  Like, they're like, we need you to do an event.  Uh, what is it, a part, what, no, it's not a graduation.  Um, it's, uh, this, this man has cut his penis off and we'd like you to play some songs  while everybody eats it. 
[01:41:30]  Some fucking old honky tonk rag time.  There's like funny music playing  He did take the gig  He took the gig  Yeah, he did  I wonder what that pays  That's how his career's going  But the funny thing is  One guy paid for it  And said fuck it  And didn't show up  So there was a portion of dick  That didn't get used  Yeah, you're gonna eat that  Yeah, but imagine  If his dick tasted awful  And he's like  Well, we have some left 
[01:42:00]  And nobody wanted it  No one wants it  It was mine  Eat my cock  Do you want to put that in the freezer?  He's gotta eat his own dick  They made it into a tinfoil cock  I can only eat one bite  I'm gonna take the rest home  You gotta put it in a little  Hot pocket sleeve  When you heat it back up  Yeah  The crisping sleeve  So it doesn't get soggy  In the microwave  Would you eat a guy's severed  Imagine biting into the vein  You can't chew it  It gets stuck between your teeth 
[01:42:30]  I hate that in beef  When there's that fucking artery in there  You ever cut through a steak  And you see like a big fucking artery  What is that?  I'm gonna pull it out  I'm not eating that  I'm always afraid  To eat the little black things in shrimp  I'm always afraid  That's shrimp duty  It is  That's why I don't eat it  Yeah, they're supposed to be deveined  William deveined  I don't want  That asshole in his gold commercial  I don't want fucking shrimp shit  No  That's why you gotta get the bigger shrimp  So it's easier to get the shit out of 
[01:43:00]  You see a little popcorn shrimp  I hate popcorn shrimp  They're good  Oh, they're not  When they're cooked  I love a good popcorn shrimp  I don't like fucking popcorn  Lobster with peel and eat shrimp  It's like, I don't want to do the work  You eat them while you're watching a movie or something  You got legs all over your fingers  Yeah, red lobster stinks  It's just a mess  Crab legs  Go fuck yourself  Why?  Slice your finger up  I'm trying to get one of those stupid legs  I love king crab legs  Outs of meat  Just a tiny piece of meat  I always leave too much meat into my thing 
[01:43:30]  Do you?  Yeah  I love cracking those open  Fucking  You know how to eat them?  They're a weapon though  I hate them  Fucking spikes on them  They fight back  That's a food that fights back  Yeah  And then if you cut yourself on one of those shells  You know you're in for a good week of infection  In that wound  It's crazy  Don't you feel bad though  Because they burn them alive  I can't eat  I try not to eat lobster and crab  I feel really bad for them  Oh, they cook them like that  Yeah, I hate that  Do they crab so much?  Yeah  Do they get those?  Those guys are still moving  They have pain sensors?  No, crabs get  Don't crabs get like immediately fucking 
[01:44:00]  I don't know  Just frozen  I watch Deadliest Catch  Yeah, they immediately just get frozen  No, they put them in the boat  And they're still alive when  They get to the dock  In Alaska  But then I don't know what happens  Do they freeze them to death?  That's terrible  I think they immediately just  Yeah, but it's not terrible  To be thrown in ice naked?  That sucks  I hate the meanness of it  What is this?  Do you think that little primitive  Lobster brain  Yes, I do  Can fucking figure that shit out? 
[01:44:30]  Yeah, there's pain sensors  Look at them  He's just cooking these all live  This piece of shit  Is that worse than being ripped apart  By some fucking  No  Slowly ripped apart by an animal  That fucking eats lobster  Is it worse than being hung upside down  Having your throat cut?  That's terrible too  Watching your friend just dangle there too  Having a bolt shot through your fucking head  I just feel bad  On the assembly line  Yeah  It's mean  I don't know  It's so delicious though  I know  They're lovely  Yeah  How great was that pork at the barbecue this weekend?  It was good  But I don't love pork  They lullaby the pig to sleep 
[01:45:00]  Why'd you bring that home?  You should throw that out  It's terrible  They made me  What?  She made it for me  Get rid of it dude  It's fucking gonna kill you  Actually pork meat's not bad  It's actually  It's not bad  It's like chicken  It's just like turkey  You can't eat the fat  Or the skin  Throw all that shit out  But all the white meat  In the dark  It's just like turkey meat  The other white meat  It's the same shit  It's low sodium  There's not that much in it  You should just go veggie  For a fucking month  Yeah  I stopped sugar  Did you?  Yeah  What does that do?  I just stopped eating sugar 
[01:45:30]  I don't have sugar in my coffee anymore  I don't do shit  Does that help?  Does it lose weight?  Yeah  I know nothing about like fucking good diet  It's terrible  And I eat Twizzlers like crazy at my house  I love your house  I love a good Twizzler  I love going to your house  There's just snacks everywhere  Snacks and candy  I know  I love Norton just disappears  And comes back with a bag of something  Yeah  I don't know where he goes  Jimmy goes to like fucking  It's like let's make a deal  Jimmy's by door number one  Opens it up  Ooh chips  What's that?  I know where Anthony's snack closet is 
[01:46:00]  But I try not to eat too much  Like I went there last week  And we just sat around eating fucking lime Tostitos  Those are the best  They're fucking  I got you hooked on pretzels didn't I?  You got me hooked on pretzels and mustard  Yeah  My wife  That's hard cut  Hates mustard  Why?  Hates it  She just fucking hates it  Just despises mustard  He got me hooked on mustard  I love pretzels  Like hard pretzels  And I put them on a plate  And I just dip the mustard  Oh mustard  What is that Danny?  What is that thing?  Well this is how you're supposed to boil a lobster  You're supposed to actually kill the lobster first 
[01:46:30]  You are right?  And then  See you gotta get to  You gotta put it right in the brain  Oh my god  Take a nice sharp knife  Lobster goes out like Maury in fucking Casino  Shut the fuck up  You gotta get right between the exoskeleton  Yeah why don't you kill it?  Oh that's not good either  Cut his head in half  That's probably quicker than boiling it  Much quicker than boiling it  I think I'd rather get my throat slit  What do you gotta give a fucking lobster a warrior's death?  Come on  Throw him  Wait is that still alive or is that dead?  That's probably just twitching  There's a lot of motor functions 
[01:47:00]  You gotta burn him  Especially when there's a brain injury  You gotta burn him like Conan  Wow  Yeah  Oh no it's still moving  It's got a meat cleaver  Yeah it's just twitching though I think  It's just like you know  Like Danny said  Dude I killed a silverfish once  And it twitched for like 45 minutes  It was insane  The dumber the fucking animal  The longer it's gonna move around without its brain  That looks like a fucking Prometheus thing  I don't mind that though  How did he know that he even hit the brain?  The brain on a lobster is so fucking small  How do you know he even hit it?  He split his head in half  Yeah but what exactly in half? 
[01:47:30]  One way or the other  A fucking half an inch  And you're missing the brain  Yeah but you're still cutting him in half though  It's a little fucking thing  What if his little brain is in the half that's attached?  Yeah he's still got a big split down his head  He doesn't know what's happening  Jimmy would you feel better  If these people actually caught their lobsters?  Oh look at this little bag  No I mean a lobster  I just don't like the way they kill it cruelly  I mean I eat meat so I'm not  And we've talked about this before  I'm not being self-righteous  Like you're bad for eating meat  I eat it  I just hate the way  The unnecessary cruelty of killing it 
[01:48:00]  Dude this is fucked up  They're cutting this thing up  And it's still moving  It's twitching though  You throw it in the hot water  It fucking stops moving  I think she got the brain first  They got the brain first  Look no  The meat is still twitching  The meat is moving  This is a crazy way  No fucking way  Yeah but you know if they're in the water  They're just going  Ow ow ow ow  It's hot  I have eyes over my head  I can't even close it  Ow my eyes  Ow ow ow  It burns  My eyes  His eyes are all wide open  Ow it's hot  They're not even moving for a fucking  For two seconds after you 
[01:48:30]  Throw them in that water  You're feeling bad over fossils  What?  These are just  These are just fossils  They're shellfish  Walking around  But they have paint  They might as well be trilobites  That's the same thing  But they are alive  Trilobites  Oh yeah  Well it depends on why the bites  Go on trial  Would they commit crimes or something  Steal stuff  Jesus Christ  A murder maybe  I did  I did deep sea fishing last week  Deep sea fishing  Deep sea fishing  They're fucking  It's pretty rough  They treat fish like shit 
[01:49:00]  It's terrible  I mean they catch  The fish they get  To catch the bigger fish  They just see schools of them  And they throw a three pronged  Hooked  Out in the middle  And just yank it back  Oh man  And catch them on the side  And wheel these fish in  Yeah  And then throw like five or six of them  In a bucket  And then hook them in the mouth  Alive  And then throw them out  And then the big fish come  And when you're done  At the end of the day  It's just guts and eyes  And heads  You know what I mean  It's like a fucking 
[01:49:30]  A horror movie for fish  I'm a fly fisherman  I have a little dry fake fly  Yeah yeah  I touch the water  Before I touch the fish  And I let them back out  I pinch my hooks off  Wait why do you touch the water  Before you touch the fish  Because you'll fuck up the fish  If you touch it with a dry hand  You need to have  The little scales don't like that  Sensitive  It's not a scale really  I rub them down  With Vaseline intensive care  Yeah  Because they're dry  Petroleum jelly works  Petroleum jelly  I dip them in crude oil  Yeah I know  Remember jerking off 
[01:50:00]  With petroleum jelly  Yeah Vaseline  Oh yeah  In the old days  You had to  You really didn't have  Much of a choice  In that medicine cabinet  My mom had the Vaseline  It always had like a fucking  Just nice pube in it  And a fucking  The tip of my head  Fucking imprint  In the fucking Vaseline  You were fucking  The actual jar  You go down there  You go down that road  I used to fuck shampoo bottles  How  Remember the old shampoo bottles  With the big hole  Wasn't that big  Took my dick in  I'm trying to think of  Any shampoo bottles  Well now the shampoo bottles 
[01:50:30]  Are the little tiny  Squeezy holes  You know what I mean  So you just use a dab  But back in the day  They wanted you to use  The whole bottle in one  So you buy more  So the shampoo bottle  Was just an open  Fucking hole  Yeah  I so don't remember that  Like Brett  Remember Brett  Breck  Breck  That was it  Breck  Brett was the guy  Who molested you  Breck was the shampoo  I wish I knew his name  Do you know  Oh the Vaseline  I remember  I used to always have  Chap lips when I was a kid  So I would use Vaseline 
[01:51:00]  Intensive care  And I brought a jar of it  I brought a fucking  A small like  Using a friend  As an applicator  Yeah exactly  That was your excuse  I have chap lips  I had to suck my friend's  Slimy vast cock  Now I remember putting  That's his fucking  Oil rig cock  I remember trying to  Make my friends laugh  In school  Jimmy would go up and down  Like one of those  O-Rigs  Vaseline's building up  Around his mouth  And I had glasses  So I took Vaseline 
[01:51:30]  And I smeared it  All over my glasses  And I put my glasses on  Just to make my friend laugh  In class  Did it work?  And my teacher  Just looked at me  And she's like  What are you doing?  And I'm like  Oh it was an accident  My friend's like  But you can see  The finger smears  What does it mean  It was an accident?  I don't know  The joke makes no sense  What a little douchey kid you were  He was  So much little  Annoying  So needy  Oh you wanted attention  See like  Ant wanted sympathy attention  So he used to cry  For no reason 
[01:52:00]  And Jim just had no idea  How to get positive attention  So he did like  The shittiest  Doucheiest  You think that's douchey  To put Vaseline  All over my glasses?  It's almost as bad  As walking by a girl's house  Playing Iron Man  So she thought you were tough  Yeah I did that  Some people just wrap  Their straw like hair up  Into a ponytail  Exactly  What was worse  When you realized  That nobody was laughing  At the Vaseline  On the glasses  When you did the 
[01:52:30]  Shut up  Shut up  Is the worst  That's the worst ever  Shut up  I did  I told  I did  I went to a dance  And Carol Coughlin  Was there  The hottest chick in the world  Seventh grade dance  And I walked up  So  Went to the dance  I was doing  A little bit  Sufter now  Remember that dance?  Oh yeah  And you go down  Shout  Then I did the worm  And she was watching me  She was watching me  And when I came over  She goes  Wow you dance pretty good 
[01:53:00]  Ew  And she goes  Do you have a cigarette?  And I had my pack of cigarettes  And I took a cigarette out  And I went like this  Whoa whoa whoa whoa  Let me try to explain this  To the listener  Bobby took a cigarette  Out of the pack  And then his hand  I did the wave  Did a wave motion  Where it's like a serpent  Going through the water  Up and down  His arm was doing the worm  Was doing the worm  So you just went like this  Three times 
[01:53:30]  And gave her the cigarette  She went  I'm all set  Oh  In seventh grade  She knew you were a dick bag  I wanted this fucking broad  For years  I remember in first grade  She was the shit  Finally I'm at the point  Where I did my dance  And she was like  Oh my god  You dance really good  Oh my god  And she goes  Did you get a cigarette?  And I was like  Fucking yeah  I just went  A nit  Cigarette  And I did the wave  With my hand  And I went  And I held it up  To see her face  She goes  I'm all set  Yeah but what does she look like now?  I bet you don't feel so bad  I bet she's still smoking  She had that fucking  That gene 
[01:54:00]  That  She's not smoking  If someone gives her a cigarette  Like that  Jesus Christ  Were you embarrassed?  You are a tool  I felt  I felt like shit  Did you stop dancing?  I went from the best night  Of my life  To the worst fucking night  Of my life  You thought you had her  I did  She went  You danced great  Can I have a smoke?  All I had to do was  Hand her one  Yeah here you go  Here you go  You didn't try to cover up  Like I'm just kidding  Here  I do that all the time  To make people think  I'm an asshole  And that's back when  You remember when punk  Remember when punked hair 
[01:54:30]  Came in  The spiked hair  Yeah  On the top  Long in the back  Short on the sides  Yeah  I had that  But I couldn't  I couldn't do the punk  Because I had curly hair  And I had cowlicks in the front  So I couldn't really get the punk  So at the beginning of the night  It would look good  But then the end of the night  It would kind of just  Curl up and  Fold down  And  I just looked like  A shitty redneck  I had my polo shirt  I had my polo shirt  The collar up  But I didn't have starch  So I would just iron it  So then it would get sweaty 
[01:55:00]  So then it would just  Kind of flop down  You had a fucking  Expiration date  Of like an hour  Yeah  Bobby's dark man  I had to get laid  In the first 45 minutes  Yeah  That's it  If you didn't do it by midnight  You'd turn back into an elephant  I mean a pumpkin  Wow man  Shit  That's horrible  That wave  That worm with the arm  Is bad  There's nothing more brutal  Than fucking up like that  At that age 
[01:55:30]  Like cause  Cause you know what  It meant  To get the girl  You wanted  In school like that  No  Exactly  Exactly  So like  If you even had a chance  At it  And blew it  It's all you thought about  Was how you fucked  That one up  I still remember it  I still fucking remember it  I still remember that part  I never ever got  The girl  No  I always got  A girl  Right  Or a kind of chick  I never got  The  That girl  Were there a lot of them  Were there a lot of 
[01:56:00]  That girl  Yeah  Where you came so close  To you talk to them  And you finally  But there was just  Something about me  That didn't jive  With them  Yeah  That type of person  It's just something  You know like  I was nice enough to  Hey what are you doing  Hang out and talk  But then I'd say  Or do something  That they'd just be like  Nah  I'm gonna go fuck him  Every girl I really was into  Like that  They  They  I got up to the point  Where I was friends 
[01:56:30]  With them  And they couldn't  Close the deal  And had to listen  To all their  Fucking shit  About guys  Like oh  Why doesn't he like me  And I'm just like  What the fuck  Ryan Reynolds  Yeah you were fucking  Ryan Reynolds  Me  I can show you  What a deal  Relationship  Oh  He doesn't appreciate you  Oh how fucking  Sad  You know what I got  A lot of girls  Where they would go  With the cool  Fucking  Badass motherfucker 
[01:57:00]  And you'd be friends  And then they'd go  With you  As like  I don't want that anymore  I don't want cool  I don't want really cool  And good looking  And awesome  I'm gonna try  This schlub  Okay good  I'm gonna try  This schlub  Who likes me  Yeah this guy  Actually kind of likes me  And then it lasts  A week  And then they get bored  With that  They go right back  They go back  To fucking cool guy  Yeah  I was sitting at this  I had a project to do  I had to make a  A um  Diorama  Are they called  Those things  You take a little 
[01:57:30]  In the shoebox  Shoebox  And you make a little thing  And you cut the top  Part of the top  Of the shoebox off  And you put wax paper  Over it  So the light shines through  I didn't make one of those  Because I wasn't a  Fucking puss whacker  In school  Look  It wasn't fucking college  Okay  It was fucking  What were you making  In the diorama  Like fifth grade  Like I said  It was a dinosaur scene  So I had a mirror  In there as a pond  And I put clay around it  To make it look like  It's little mountains  And stuff  That's pretty good  And yeah  Construction paper trees 
[01:58:00]  And shit like that  Did you work really hard on it  I worked very hard on it  And then  What happened was  A class was now  Going to come into our class  And walk around the desks  And look at everybody's project  There you go  That's  Here's a good one  That looks just like mine  That probably is yours  That probably is mine  What the fuck  Big cancerous potato  It looks like  Yeah I know  That's not a volcano  That looks awful  Looks like a hemorrhoid  It's an alien egg  Yeah  It's an alien egg  This girl that I 
[01:58:30]  I was fucking  Just infatuated with  She was in the other class  So she's walking by  Everybody's desk  Looking at all their projects  And I'm just looking at her  And she's walking away  Down the line  Coming to my fucking project  And I'm just like  Oh my god  I'm getting all nervous  And fucking palms sweaty  And everything  She steps right in front of me  I look at her  And she just kind of  Picks the diorama up  Looks in it  And then she put it down  And just smiled  She gave me this smile  That just I fucking  I think I came  In my pants  And it was definitely 
[01:59:00]  She stopped for a second  You know  Smiled  And then just like  Kind of walked away  And I  I regret it to this day  What?  Not fucking saying something  I sat there like a lump of shit  She smiled at me  I didn't do shit  What were you gonna say?  I don't know  Did you like my diorama?  I have hair like  Lawrence Hilton Jacobs  You wanna go out?  I didn't think so  I'll make another one  Fucking zilch  You did exactly 
[01:59:30]  What you should've done  You shut your fucking  Scientific mouth  Cause now you'd be  Regretting it  If you would've  Talked to her  You would've blown it  Offered her a duty cookie  Hey you wanna come over  And hear my father  Call me a faggot?  You made exactly  The right move  Cause now you'd be  Looking back  On how you blew it  Really?  Yes  What were you gonna say  To her?  I don't know  Look at my dinosaurs  You had other chances  What did she go to  Fucking  Did she move  The next day? 
[02:00:00]  No but that was  No let me tell you  Something though  I had chances  Before and after  But I was so fucking  As a kid like that  You don't walk up  And cold call a girl  In the fucking  Playground or something  Like that  That was the moment  That was our fucking  Moment  She was looking at me  Smiling  That was your moment  Not hers  Right I know  She's like look at this  Fucking oh goodness  He's good for something  He's obviously not  Fucking a nice guy  Or a worthwhile person  But he sure can build  A dinosaur in a shoebox  Who gives a shit  That fucking half 
[02:00:30]  The fucking half breed  Over there  Fucking did a good shoebox  Yeah exactly  Exactly  This son of a drunk  Really did a wonderful job  You're wrecking me  She was beautiful  No I'm trying to  You made the right move  No I didn't  I know I should have  Said something to her  Yeah that's the worst  Right when you look back  I should have fucking  Just went like hi  Or something  I sat there  Like a dunce  Yeah  Like a mute  And she just walked away  What would you say  To that girl  If you could talk to her  Like say you could go back  And she's looking  Fucking lick your pussy 
[02:01:00]  No no  Before cynical Anthony  What would you say  To that girl  If you could go back  How old were you  I was probably  He was in retard high school  No seriously  Let me think  Maybe fifth grade  Okay so how old is that  Like ten  Yeah probably  Something like that  Alright now  She's all pretty  And she's sitting there  Looking at you  Oh yeah  What did you want to say to her  That's just it  I don't know  I'll be her 
[02:01:30]  You be you  Ready  Alright  Alright  So I'm gonna go  She didn't  No words were spoken  This was what  The weird thing was  She didn't say anything  She just walked up  Alright here  I'm gonna walk up  I'm gonna walk up  Ready  I'm looking at Bobby here  Okay  Oh  She's smiling at the door  Hey Dawn  You got fat  So Anthony wait  I'm her back then  You're not  You're not using  The right motivation  I'm sorry Bobby  Okay  Yeah  Alright ready 
[02:02:00]  Let's do it again  Alright  We're gonna walk up  What would you say to her  Let's use a different example  Other than fucking Bob  In his big awful green shirt  You look like Gameron  Gameron  How the fuck  Did you pull that reference  Oh shit  Oh god  Yeah  Yeah we should be  Having turtles  So  Oh boy  I fucking hate Chip 
[02:02:30]  He really just sucks a dick  Just puts the fucking  High-bosh  So what would you say  I think I would start out  With just  Hey hi  Hi  Yeah  And then I would stare  At her and watch her  Walk away again  No but what do you get  Having said hi  What else you got  Bug eye  That's funny  That's a great picture  That was one of my favorites  Oh yeah  Wait what do you want to say  Or like you  Let's say  She's looking at your fucking thing 
[02:03:00]  Did she pick it up  Yes  See she was bold enough  Just to pick your project up  Well she would be  What did you want to get on  Her knees in front of the desk  To look into the diorama  I would have loved it  No but she picked up the diorama  She picked it up  She looked in it  And then as she went to put it down  She looked at me  And she made a big smile  And like waited  Like she was waiting for me to say something  She wasn't  I know  She was debating whether she should take yours  Because she was fucking some dude last night  She didn't make hers  Let me take this fucking dweebs 
[02:03:30]  She wasn't fucking anybody  Here's what you should have said  Yeah  Okay I'll  I know I don't look  I know I'm nothing now  But someday  Yeah  I'm going to have a lot  I'm still going to be nothing  But I'm going to have a lot of money  Someday you're going to be mine Lorraine  When she picked it up and looked at you  You should have said  Pull the fucking thing down  You're going to break it  She's all taken aback  Did you want to say to her 
[02:04:00]  Hi  Do you like my diorama?  Because she would have said  Yeah  That's why I'm holding it  Asshole  Yeah  Smiling aren't I?  That's too needy too  I just would have  I just would have said  Hi  Hi  I go  Yeah hi  You would have said something dumb though  Like that's not really a lake  No actually  I would probably say something like this  I would go  Hi  Hi  Eh  Project  How to  How to make it  I know  We go to school  That's what we're doing  I know it's stupid  Don't make her like she's a wise 
[02:04:30]  Don't make her like she's Julia fucking Roberts  In Pretty Woman motherfucker  I actually like my project  She's a dumb kid  I like doing this  No but then she would have said  Oh good I hate you bitch  Then she would have said  It's not dumb  Like all the rest of the other women  Oh it's not dumb  It's good  It's the best one in the class  Oh thanks  Thanks  I just you know  Eh  You want to go for some chocolate milk?  No I really don't  Because what you'll learn  No no  What you'll learn  I'm drinking already  I'm 10  What you'll learn is that  Although I like your diorama  Never has anybody fucked anyone 
[02:05:00]  Because they had a good diorama  This is the beginning  Middle and end of us  Knowing each other  Here you go shit  See cause if  I only fuck kids  In 10th grade  I only date boys  Who don't need to feel good  About themselves  By making a diorama  I date the guy  Who didn't make his diorama  Oh I'd have tried  To have been a little awkward  And like  Self deprecating  About the diorama  Yeah that's exactly

Millions of red-blooded men have gotten rigid over the excitement  Of Fifty Shades of Gay  Bro, I've tasted my cum?

[02:16:00]  Because no Opie here  Nopi  Maybe tomorrow?  What's the progress report?  Anybody here?  I believe that the word is that he is planning on returning tomorrow  Yeah, but he has to wipe off his buttocks because both butt cheeks apparently were covered with spray shit 
[02:16:30]  That he laid in bed on his side and spray shat out the back  Spray shat?  And like when he went to go to the bathroom, he spray shat all down the back of his legs and calves  So the shit, that's when shit gets underneath the seat  Oh, it's not even a seat, like in bed  It went against the wall, hit the wall  Oh, sheets, everything  It looked like a blunt trauma wound to the head from someone laying in bed 
[02:17:00]  Only brown  You have brown yawn coming down  Yeah, you actually have people figuring out the splatter pattern  From his butthock  Yeah  Yeah  It's all over  Yeah  We were talking about that whole thing with the girls  And how you regret not saying things to them years ago  There was one other case where it wasn't so much that I liked this girl  Or she did anything that would have led me to believe that she liked me or anything 
[02:17:30]  But I didn't do something again  She was at the lockers  This was in junior high  She was at the lockers  And some two black gentlemen that were in the school  Walked over  And she kind of had her head really close to the locker  Thought it was hilarious to kick the locker door into this girl's head  And they did  And I was at my locker  Which was, I don't know  Fucking 20 feet away  Saw the whole thing  And it just smacked her in the head 
[02:18:00]  And she just started crying  She's on her, like, knees  Holding her head  Crying in front of her locker  And the brothers just kind of went  And walked away  And I didn't say anything  I should have comforted her, maybe  I think, like, I should have walked up  And said, like  Oh, man, you okay?  Or just anything  And nothing  Sorry I did nothing while that happened  Exactly  But I'll repay it later in life  When I have guns  I'll carry this hatred and bigotry with me forever  Listen  I will avenge you 
[02:18:30]  This story explains a lot  Yeah  Listen, my inability to comfort you right now  Will come out on a mania website someday  That's the only way Anthony can come  If a girl's crying, holding her head  Hating black people  Yes  Wow  How true  Yeah  Boy, that got me  I was just like  And you didn't say  Said something  Yeah, again  Little Anthony  Little crybaby Anthony  Wouldn't say anything  What was this, Long Island?  No  Wait, wait 
[02:19:00]  No, that was California  Why didn't you hit them?  Junior high in California  Because he would have got his ass beaten  They were black guys  Yeah  And black guys in school  Were very frightening  To white kids in school  Yeah  Yeah, you never  You never screwed around  With the black guys  I thought of black kid in sixth grade  And it was  Got your ass kicked  No  I just  He wouldn't fucking go down  I thought  I was like  I actually said to him  I go  Is your skin different?  I didn't know  I'm not being racist  Did you think he was armor plated?  I just thought  He was  Because he wouldn't  It was a little thin dude 
[02:19:30]  He wound up being  Me and him wound up being friends  After this  But I kept hitting him  With all I had  Lifetime story there  He wouldn't fucking  What  Were you hitting him in the face?  In the face  In the head  That head  Everything  You've heard the rumors  You've heard the stories growing up  I remember my dad telling me  You ever fight a black guy  Don't hit him in the head  He was a tough motherfucker  Man  My father actually told me  To kick him in the knees  My father was the best racist ever 
[02:20:00]  He'd be like  Yeah you can't hit him in the head  Fucking it won't go down  Kick him in the knees  That's the weak spot  Alright Jimmy the Greek  He was hilarious  You gotta kick him in the knees  Kick him in the knees  Take his knees out  You ever see a black guy  Fucking skating?  No  Their knees are weak  They got their weak knees  That's why you don't play hockey  Like alright dad  Thanks dad  Thank you  That coupled with 
[02:20:30]  You know  The locker kicking  And fucking  And that other guy  That used to ask me  For 50 cent every day  Yo man  Give me 50 cent  I used to do that  But I need that  I need my 50 cent  I used to get the money  I used to whip  Yeah  Fucking petrified  Me and my friend  Used to take everybody's  Lunch tickets  Lunch tickets?  You know a lunch ticket day  Like a welfare school  Where you going to  You get lunch tickets  You get the announcement  Over the PA  And they'd go  And we'd go to the bathroom  And we'd get one lunch ticket 
[02:21:00]  From everybody  You'd shake them down  And then we'd sell them  To the people with the dollars  Either they had a lunch ticket  Or they had a dollar  Lunch was 85 cents  How'd you get a lunch ticket?  We'd take one from everybody  No not you  How did they get the lunch tickets?  They'd just get them  Because your fucking family  Your family's poor  Oh so it was like the welfare  Yeah it was welfare  Lunch  And then the kids with the dollars  We'd exchange them with the dollar  So it's only  You're only lending me 15 cents  Oh look at that  So you make some money out of it  Yeah we'd make a fucking  Yeah we'd make it 
[02:21:30]  That's how we bought our drugs  And drank  Right  Fucking Bowery boys over here  Walking around  Shaking people down  For lunch tickets  Yeah for lunch tickets  I made like 6-7 bucks a day  Wow  It was good back then  School's like prison  You don't have to make  A lot of money  A joint was $2 back then  You get a fucking joint  For two bucks  But it was a buck  Yeah it'd be a buck  Two bucks  Where did you fucking  I never paid $2 for a joint  You got a fucking pinner  Well  A pinner  You get a little pinner  For a dollar  A pinner  Remember the little pinners  Little fucking toothpicks  Rolled with an easy wide  A double wide 
[02:22:00]  To try to make it fucking  I tried to sell weed once  Trying to make it fatter  I tried to sell weed once  We got a big bag of weed  How'd that work out  Oh we just wound up  Smoking the whole bag  In two joints  We rolled them all  And as we were rolling  We were smoking them  Some business man  And then we literally  Unrolled all the ones  We rolled  Like fuck this  We unrolled them  Put them back in the bag  Then went to the park  And rolled two big lubbers  And just got fucking wasted  Then went to a pizza store  And got fucking  Just laughed for an hour  And a half straight  Couldn't order pizza 
[02:22:30]  Just going  Wah  Anytime the broad came over  I sold drugs once  Yeah  Yeah block of hash  Oh  Like a ten or five  In Amsterdam  No it was a small  Teeny small piece of hash  Midnight express  It was like a $20 piece of hash  In aluminum foil  Oh  And that was it  I used to love hash  Are you scared?

[02:23:00]  I remember that  You'd take a book  And you'd stick a pin  Through the book  So it's sticking out  Of the cover  And then you'd put the hash  On top of the pin  And then put the glass  On top of the pin  Yeah  And then it would light  And you'd light it  Smoke would fill up the glass  And then you'd slide the glass  Over to the edge of the book  Yep  And go  Watch it  It expands  In your lungs man  It expands  How great was fucking weed?

[02:25:30]  They're actually yapping  Fucking fat Bob's gonna die  Yeah Bob is  And he's telling me  He's telling me like  It's a fucking secret  Yeah  Why don't you talk to me?  I am  Yeah but no  Oh you're not there  Huh?  Oh Bobby  Jesus  What's he doing?  Who said that?  I did  No who's the we?  Just anybody who knows you  Is worried about you  Who's we?  We're all worried about you  Tom Pop is worried about you  First of all  Anthony  I really don't worry about anybody  I love you dude  You don't care  No Bob  Anthony knows 
[02:26:00]  I do  I do  I don't voice it  But I do  I care  Oh my god  No  You're working at it though  Yeah I'm working  I'm fine  Yeah  As long as you're working at it  There's no  You know  We can't be lobbing bits of flesh  Off the poor gentleman  But you gotta work  You gotta go boxing today  The fast way  Yeah the fast way  Just cut it off  Yeah you need a nutritionist  I think  To help you out  What is that?  They specialize in like  A hooker that doesn't blow you  And tells you what to eat  That's pretty much it  They specialize 
[02:26:30]  But you still try to get her to blow you  Every time she comes over  Da da da da da  How do a nutritionist come over  And take a look at that  He tries to get anybody to blow him  He orders pizza  See right back to that  No you get a nutritionist  To come over  And help you with a diet  And see what in your house  Should go  And what  His wife would say  Bobby  Just cause your fucking addiction  Doesn't add weight  Let me tell you something  If fucking cum had calories  You'd be a fat fuck too  But you see  You see how  That's why people 
[02:27:00]  Don't like to talk to you  I'm sorry  I'm sorry  I'm kidding  I'm kidding  I'm just kidding  I'm kidding  But I'm saying you gotta  I'm kidding  It's the radio show  I'm sorry  I'm not offended  When you have a good one  You gotta let it out  Yeah of course  I'm not offended  I just  We can deal with my addiction soon  But he is  But he is right  No he is right  If cum  No you are  If cum had calories  Jimmy would be a fucking two of me  Ralphie May would go  You're fat motherfucker  This would be Jim on the air 
[02:27:30]  But you should get a nutritionist at your house  Do you have a nutritionist?  No look at me  I'm also awful  I'm just not in health danger awful  I still suck  E-Rock's going to the doctor  To figure out a dietary plan  Well he really  He needs to go gluten free  Gluten free  He's gotta be gluten free  What is gluten?  What is that?  I don't know  It's like bread  It's everything  Why is that new  It's in wheat  And people  All of a sudden  It's the thing 
[02:28:00]  The new thing to have  I'm cutting out carbs  For three weeks  And I'm cutting out sugars forever  I'm gonna try to do sugar forever  Like I'm drinking coffee now  With no sugar  And light  No cream  Skim milk  Which sucks  It sucks  Right now  I'm getting used to it though  But it fucking blows  Why does everything that tastes so good  Have to be so bad?  That's the age old question Anthony  I've been asking that at the pilot every week  I do need  I would like to get in that 
[02:28:30]  This losing weight  I've done it before  This one's hard for some reason  Because you're older man  It's like when you get to be 40  It's fucking hard  For even guys who work out a lot  It's harder to lose weight  Well it's also too  My fucking wife  Back in the day losing weight  You were single or whatever  You were on the road all the time  You were out  You didn't really fucking give a fuck about eating  But now like  I was doing good all week  I wasn't eating bad  I was eating good  Going to boxing  Working out  I got the treadmill  I take the train  I don't take any more cabs  I walk everywhere  I got this new fucking Nike stupid thing 
[02:29:00]  And then I come home Saturday  And my wife cooked a big bowl of fucking pasta  Now do you think  Let me say  Do you think she's enabling you secretly?  Because she loves you  And she's afraid you're going to leave  And maybe she wants to fuck you  I would never leave her  I'd fuck other chicks  But I'm not going to leave her  But that's  It's not something  I'm kidding  It's not something you think about  Consciously  I would never leave her  But you don't think  As a woman  You don't think that consciously  Like I'm going to make Bob pasta  So he doesn't fuck other girls  It's not a conscious thing  But do you think 
[02:29:30]  They call them feeders  Maybe she's keeping you  Maybe she wants to keep fucking giving you food  Because  I don't know  I don't think so  I think that she just wanted pasta  She doesn't give a fuck  She doesn't have to care like me  She wanted pasta  She made it  And had vegetables in it  And I fucked up  Here's the thing  Is  This time  For some reason  It's just  The barbecue this weekend  Once you give yourself the go ahead  Like that  You're out of control  It was like watching Mickey Rourke in Barfly 
[02:30:00]  Watching him run around  To my friends  Yeah he's got a fucking  He's got corn chips in one hand  A fucking whoopie pie in the other  You ate the whoopie pie?  What  Which one?  Oh man  You had a few whoopie pies?  Are you out of your mind?  I'm not going to fucking eat just one  My wife made whoopie pies  Oh  But here's the thing  The day before  The whoopie pies and the cookies  Were all in the  I didn't have one of them  I'm fine  Now what happened?  Did you really eat in the shower?  I fucking  Well alright  So I lied  I did eat in the shower  Well here's the deal  She made cookies 
[02:30:30]  Dude eating in the shower  Yeah I didn't  I didn't take a shower  I was fake taking a shower  That's even sicker  To eat the cookie  At least if you were taking the shower  You were doing something  The fact that you turned the water on her  Said I'll be right back  I'm going to shower  And then came back still smelling  With cookie on your face  I've had beers in the shower  I have  That was just to stop the shakes though  No shakes are good to shampoo your hair  Would you really have beers in the shower?  Yeah I would crack a beer  And be like 
[02:31:00]  Oh yeah I gotta take a shower  But I didn't want to leave the beer  Because you know  God forbid  So I'd bring it in the shower  And just like  Put it up on one of the little  You know  Ledges  I don't think that's too insane  But I had an ex that would smoke cigarettes  In the shower  How do you do that?  Well there was a window  And there was like a  Very very small window  With a small ledge  So you know  She would just kind of  Hold her hand up there  And use one hand  Even your fingers getting wet though  Like wets the paper  And then it rips  I'm with you  I can never do that  That's a tough one 
[02:31:30]  I would have to clean up  Mountains of cigarettes  Our showers are still better  Than his attic showers  Wait which one?  The golden ones  Oh  At least we were showering  Yeah  I'm thinking  Me, you, and  Three of us  Are very addicted people  Yeah  Danny I think  Is fucking addicted  I think your drinking  Is a fucking problem  Well no  Not anymore  I've just transferred it over  To different things  I love  I think you're an addict  Personality  Sam, I don't know 
[02:32:00]  I mean  No  He's addicted to  Sam's a fucking  Fucking people loving him  In power  No, Sam's addicted  Yeah, he's  Taking over everything you have  I'm probably more compulsive  Look at that chair  Same thing  Look how comfortable  He is in that chair  Oh, I know  He is so comfy right there  Oh, he's slowly  Making sure that  It's sat up way up high  So he'll be above everybody else  Sam  Sam Opie Roberts  He really is  Waiting for that  Fucking call  Oh, yeah  Oh, yeah  I was Opie  I'd watch my back  Let's take a second  To wish him a speedy recovery 
[02:32:30]  When we have him  Yeah  Recovery from the  Fucking oatmeal  You prepared  Yeah, exactly  He's just sneezing in it  Like the mother  Sixth sense  Making him soup  It's like the  Beginning of the  Prometheus  When he poured that  Fucking alien gist  Scoop  Sorry  Oh, shit  Spoiler  Spoiler  No, but you're right  Dude  This one is  It's definitely harder  Because  Two  I also  Back when you don't have money  And you can't  Like I can just go buy  Whatever the fuck I want  Yeah, that does  Go to dinner every day 
[02:33:00]  We can order out every day  If I wanted to  But it's  The trials and tribulations  Of having cash  Yeah  It's been fucking hard  It does make the addictions harder  Because you don't feel  The fucking effects  Until it's really bad  Because financially  You don't notice it  Yeah, back in the day  I couldn't go to fucking eat  Wherever I wanted to go  I couldn't  Like if I  I had to save up  To go to dinner  Yeah  But now it's like  Yeah, just go order  Fucking steak  Were there nights  You just didn't eat  Because you didn't have money  I would  I would eat  I would eat  Like something stupid  Like, you know 
[02:33:30]  Fucking ramen noodles  Or some shit  Trying to find something  You should get a nutritionist  Just try it  Just for a while  Until you balance out  Because just quitting carbs  It's a fast way of doing it  But it doesn't  Work long term  It's hard to stay  Because you gotta eat some carbs  It's almost like  You always have  Every time you talk to Bob  He has a new way  Like, dude  I'm just doing this thing  It's the fucking  It's the South of France thing  Where you only drink  South of France  South of France  Dude, it's working  It's good  You do fucking two push-ups  And you drink milk 
[02:34:00]  And it's like  South of France  And he sells it really well  Two push-ups and drink milk  Yeah, Bob always sells it  Dude, it's a cheese block  You fucking pick it up  With a spoon  Dude, it's the Wisconsin  Fucking  Yeah  Battle be the diet  Yeah, you do that  You wear Wisconsin  Mountain Lion clothing  So he's got some fucking scheme  It's like  Instead of just doing it  The fucking  Get a nutritionist  Shut your face  Realize you don't know  What you're talking about  And fucking go to the nutritionist  Well, I do know  I do know  I've done it a bunch of times 
[02:34:30]  I do know what I'm talking about  You know now  In your head  But I know  You gotta understand  I fucking  I put this weight on intentionally  I said, fuck it  It's almost ten months non-smoking  And now I started  I'm going back to the gym  But it's been hard  You put it on intentionally  You see how good he is  Bob's a very good talker  He's very good at convincing  He has the discussion with me  What I do  But this is the discussion  He has alone  In his bathroom  You know what  Fuck it  You treat yourself  Dude  You fucking working hard  You quit smoking 
[02:35:00]  Like he makes perfect  Logical sense  He was fucking  Using the soap  In that scenario  Implying that he can actually  Still get to his back  No, I'm sorry  This is why  This is why I eat though  So here's what he does  Right  He comes in with the good advice  I care about you  And then he calls me fat fuck  And does fat jokes  And that makes me  But that makes me want to eat  So you want to know the problem  It's not my wife  It's not me  It's my friends  Oh, that's good  It's guys like Jimmy  Who come in and go  Fucking hey Daniel son

[02:48:30]  I wanna give a big fuck you  To all the people that call in  And say fuck you  To all of the characters  That Jimmy performs  Or to Anthony  Or to Joe  You're not their friends  They're performers  We're listening to them  We're laughing  We're having a great time  You didn't almost drive your car  Off the road  It's supposed to be about  Fuck your boss  Fuck your girl  Fuck your mother  Fuck your father  Whatever  Stop saying fuck you  To Jeff  He's great  Fuck you  Call the Opie and Anthony  F.U. line  866-FU-LINE-1  That's 866-FU-LINE-1 
[02:49:00]  Sirius XM  You're listening to Opie and Anthony  Ooh  Take me to try to text  And the sending bar stops  Right at the end  For no reason  It's like  And then just stops there  We tried to get  Billy Corrigan in the studio  But I hear the publicist  Is pissed at us still 
[02:49:30]  From the Eminem album play  Way back at NAW  Are you kidding?  Well  That's the word I got  Holding a grudge  Like the fucking  I heard  It goes back to Boston too  There was some stuff at AAF  That you guys  I guess pulled  And this was the same guy  That got  The shitstorm for that  For Eminem  And a couple other things  Wow okay  I mean we definitely  Would have gotten him though  Because he's doing  He's doing like  The wrestling show  He's doing everything  You know  Yeah  He's not being  He's not being specific  About what he's doing  So they're mad at the show 
[02:50:00]  So they would  What is he promoting?  I think he's got an album  Coming out  He's smashing pumpkins  So they wouldn't put him  On a show like this  Because they're still mad  But other stuff  That had nothing to do with him  What a shithead  This is why publicists  Just should be fucking  Drummed out of the business  Yeah  They really hurt the artist sometimes  No  But whatever  They do  Because everybody thinks  It's the artist  Like I read some of the tweets  About  About Mark Wahlberg  Right  You know  Some of the fans  They want to help  I mean 
[02:50:30]  I think they mean well  In their retardation  But they're bashing  Mark Wahlberg  And it's like  If you ask me  He doesn't know anything  About that bullshit  It's publicists  And fucking other people  In this building  Maybe  I don't think it has anything  To do with Mark Wahlberg  He came in  He had fun  He's just a puppet man  Yeah  Manipulating him  You know man  The business  I don't know  It's not a big deal  I mean  I'm not a huge  Smashing Pumpkins fan 
[02:51:00]  It's just  It doesn't make sense  On their end  It's like  How much  How much  Do you want to be powerful  That you are hurting  Your client  Because we wouldn't  Have benefited  Terribly  From having Billy Corrigan  It would have been  A fine segment  But it's not like  The show is any better  Or worse  Right  I'm fine without him  But it's the principle  But he probably would have  But he probably would have  Been able to get the word  Out about his project  To a lot of people  A lot more people  Yeah  Than doing the wrestling show  Yeah  Yeah  But that's just  A stupid publicist 
[02:51:30]  Trying to hold a grudge  And be mad  Instead of thinking  About what's best  For their client  Yeah  They do it all the time  They're the worst people  In the business  There are guys  That do a good job  Again  They do damage control  Right  But most of them  Have no ability  They're not talented people  Yeah  So they have to be  A part of the business  Somehow  And that's the only way  They're not good enough  To be agents or managers  So they can't make  That percentage  They're not gifted enough 
[02:52:00]  As performers  To do anything  On the performance side  So they hang around  And they basically  Just book schedules  Like that's what  Publicists do  But the other thing  Is they try to wield  Whatever power  They can possibly get  They're hated  They're really hated  And I don't even  I don't have respect  For them either  It's not like I hate  And respect them  Because I find  Most of them  To be repulsive  And I've dealt with them  On this end  And they really are  Just fucking  Real shit  Well like you said  Most of them don't have  A specific talent  Or ability  You know what I mean 
[02:52:30]  A lot of people  That are in  The cunts  A lot of the people  In the show biz  Like periphery  That don't have  Any talent  To do anything  They usually are  Real pricks too  It's like  You should be  Fucking thankful  You're even near  That business  And you're making  A career out of it  But no  They gotta be  Fucking  Cause it's all  That just resentment  And envy  That comes out  Cause they're around  People that are  Doing something  And they wield  No real power  As individuals  Like you'll never 
[02:53:00]  You'll never be  A performer  And know that power  You have no influence  Anywhere  Except this  So you're basically  A taxi cab driver  For the fucking celebrity  That's what you do  The publicist knows  That if the celebrity  Were like  No fuck you  I'm doing it  Then the publicist  Would be powerless  Powerless  Whatever you say  Yes  Okay  They're really enraging  That's why they're enraging  They do serve a function  But that part of them  I just despise  Loathe  I can't even pretend 
[02:53:30]  I like any of them  No  Even my own  I don't let come with me  And thank god  You never try to pretend  That you like them  I love it  You know what  I'm nice to the ones  That are nice  But the other ones  That aren't nice  I just  You should close the curtain  And stand outside  You fucking vulture  Don't pretend you know  What you're doing  Nice to the ones  That are nice  Remember Frank Burns  It's nice to be nice  To the nice  In Mesh  Yes  I did actually 
[02:54:00]  You know  People were very surprised  There was a  A black gentleman  Over my house  What  Yes  I had a black guest  Over my house  A guest  Who  Carlton  Oh yeah  Carlton  Oh yeah  He's the guy who  You know  He's actually a dad  Who had  You know  Didn't leave his kids  Or anything  Well more importantly  Amazing  He's the guy who  Convinced intern David  That he was Lisa Sparks  The porno star's husband  If you remember that  Yes  Do you remember  How scared intern David 
[02:54:30]  Was that day  David was  Fucking  Petrified  He ran all over  The office  He was out of the building  Before we were like  We were just fucking around  A small Jewish guy  Afraid of a  Friggin  Menacing black gentleman  You never see that  For those of you  Who don't know who Carlton is  If you've ever been to  One of our live events  He's the black guy  Who's not Earl  Fucking Earl  With his tweets  Are they good  He's  Here's what Earl  Will tweet  He'll only tweet 
[02:55:00]  Like maybe three things  First and foremost  I think it's  Some aging  Black artist  That's dead  And he's gotta then  Tweet  The announcement  Of their death  What's his  What's his twitter  Earl Douglas  I'm sorry  E Douglas 528  At  N  Oh  Yeah  Earl  It's people  That have died  Or  Pictures that he's taken  In New York City  Which I think he's photographed  More of New York City 
[02:55:30]  Than Google  That fucking guy  Has  He's taken pictures  Of every building  Every street  The rivers  We get it  Yeah a lot  Look Earl Douglas's  Photography  Oh there's the shot  Of the low angle  Up at the buildings  There you go  I mean  I love you Earl  But Jesus Christ  And then  The other one  It's like Roland's Instagram  Yeah  It's Roland's Instagram  And then the other thing  He tweets all the time  Is some  Incarcerated black gentleman  Needs to be freed  That's his deal 
[02:56:00]  Earl is a wannabe black guy  He's such a wannabe militant black guy  But he just  He can't close the deal  Do you think that like  His feelings on the incarcerated black guys  Is that a legitimate thing  Or is he just  Jumping onto a cause  Cause he  He hangs out with like  Real black people sometimes  Musicians and what not  But  And they must talk about it  And Earl's probably like  Yeah  Yeah  Freedom motherfucker  Little do they know  Oh that he's just like 
[02:56:30]  Hey guys  What he's put up with  From you guys  And from Ron and Fez  For all the years  The worst  Just horrible  He's another one  That has a dad  That didn't leave  And stuff  A lot of black people have that  Oh really  When you  When you take  When you  When you look at his pictures  Like these are pictures  That if I took them  I would think they were good  When someone else takes them  I'm like  Oh look at that shitty  Predictable city picture  Yes  But when I take them  I think that they're like  Wow look at that  Looking way up  With a filter  Doesn't it make you really  It makes you realize 
[02:57:00]  That like  They suck  Yeah  You can't  Cause yeah  If you took them  You'd be like  These are great  I gotta share these  What makes a good photographer  Like when you  What  When you  Not Earl  But there are guys  That just capture things  That like  They mean something  Like that  There's photos of people  Ansel Adams  Yeah  He's a good photographer  They capture a tone  Or a temp  Or a temperature  Or something  Or a fucking  A feeling  Yes you get a legitimate  Feeling from it  How do they  From looking at something  Like I'll look at something 
[02:57:30]  And take a picture  And it's just like  Yuck  It looks like a fucking  It looks like a kid  Got a camera for his birthday  That's every picture I take  Some kid got a camera  For his birthday  And snapped some shit  Of nothing  Is that fucking  Oh man  Look who that is  It's amazing  Oh  Niecy  It's Niecy motherfucker  Who's Niecy  Niecy motherfucker  She did that reality show  You were here  When we looked at the trailer  Weren't you  Yeah  Life with Niecy  Life with Niecy  She's like family  Leave it to Niecy  She's got a family

[02:58:30]  I would chat with Niecy  I'd be like what up  We'd do the Ebonics voice  The whole time  I'd be like what up Niecy  Motherfucking Niecy  Yeah Niecy  There she is  She's going to  Oh she's going in somewhere  I wonder what station  She's going to  She's going into Shade  Man there's a bunch of  I thought she was coming out  Is that the whole family  Is that the whole family  I don't know  What's the matter Kenny  Kenny's just like  I don't know  Eric's talking to her  But I think she just got done  With Shade  She's going in Al-Q  Oh she has another one  I think she just walked into Shade  Okay 
[02:59:00]  Maybe she's going in Al-Q  Yeah  Okay  Which thing we'll try  What'd they say Iraq  Shade kept her late  So she's late for Al-Q  So she's going in right now  Okay  And what time is she down there  About 10 to 10  Is that the whole  Leave it to Niecy family  Or is that Posse  It's just her  But there's like  Publicist  A makeup guy  A hair person  Black people travel  With so many people  Celebrities  Their posses are amazing  Now I've seen some  Some white celebrities  With some big posses 
[02:59:30]  But for the most part  It's the publicist  And then the celebrity  Black celebrities  Oh they love being surrounded  By a lot of peeps  Yo  Right  They're bringing their friends  With them  Yeah  Sharing it  Did you hear that  I'm sitting on my show again  I just saw him on TV  Yeah  Really  Fall 2013  20 years later  Yeah man  But I was watching him  Explain something in his interview  He's a good talker  Like Arsenio  The interview I saw him do  He was just describing something  And he really is good at that  Yeah  Yeah he's a pretty 
[03:00:00]  Captivating guy  When he's speaking  He's very interesting  Why is he  Did he just disappear  For all these years  Weird  He said he was being a dad  He was doing stand up  I had heard  And it may be a lie  That having Farrakhan on  They blackballed him  I'd love to ask him that  He may go  No no no  But like the Jews in Hollywood  African American  Were just I think  Very fucking  Upset about that  Like they probably felt like  Look man  You're on this show  Wow  And Jews have been  Very good to you  And then here you are  Having this guy  Who hates you 
[03:00:30]  That's what I've heard  I don't know  If that's true or not  That seems really rash  I think if you're around  Long enough though  Even if you fell off  The face of the earth  If you stick around  Long enough  They'll bring you back  It seems to be that way  In every single fucking  Well no  I guess if you've done  Something bad  They don't  But if you just  Kind of fell off  And kind of became  Like you know  Like I see Paul Williams  In some way  Shape or form  Coming back  A little bit  Because of this thing  Like I've seen people  Start  I've seen tweets  Of people that have  Gone to see him now  And stuff  And he was just 
[03:01:00]  Absolutely zero  People were talking about him  So if you just  Survive long enough  You get to have that  It will come back around  And that irony  Yeah  Irony famous wave  Comes  Becomes yeah  You're able to  Kind of  Like Hasselhoff  Exactly  Hasselhoff  Yeah  He was on Baywatch  And then he was nowhere  And then it was like  The Hoff  And then it became  The Hoff  He's the drunk guy  With the burger  And then it doesn't matter  What you do  It's just  You're that guy  Yeah  His music was popular  Always though  In Germany  They love him  Yeah but I mean  He had something  To keep him going 
[03:01:30]  Arsenio was I think  Just doing stand up  But he stopped doing movies  I'm a Knight Rider  He did that Knight Rider song  Where he said  This is the douchiest thing  I ever saw  He was in Germany  And they're all just  Clamoring for him  Like it's fucking  The Fuhrer up there  And he's standing  On the hood  Of a black  Firebird  And he's dressed  In his black leather  And he's  He's pointing out  At the audience  And he's doing a song  Called I'm the Knight Rider  But he's not  It's a character  Ew  I almost 
[03:02:00]  Collapsed  Did they like him?  They loved him  It's just a character  They couldn't have been happy  If all the stacks  At the camp  Were  Billowing smoke  Germany's terrible  Were you  Were you embarrassed  Watching it?  I was so embarrassed  He's not the Knight Rider  He's not  Yeah  It's a character  Somebody else wrote it  But he was the Knight Rider  He's also not a lifeguard  And the lights were on him  And he's fucking  He was dancing  Oh they loved him 
[03:02:30]  Do you have that?  I'd love to see that  Arsenio  What to say about Arsenio  First of all  In what regard to his show?  I'm just reading all about Arsenio  Oh and look  They brought  Larry Hagman  Is a prime example  Of some celebrity  That was just gone  Gone  And now he's back  With Dallas  Chuck Norris  When those Chuck Norris facts  Came out  All of a sudden  It was cool  Yeah  Well he was doing that show  Walker Texas Ranger  Forever  So he kind of never really  Totally went away  Here's a fun Arsenio Hall fact 
[03:03:00]  He was the original voice  Of Winston Zedmore  For Ghostbusters  The real Ghostbusters cartoon  Beating out Ernie Hudson  Who was actually Winston  In the movies  But guys  How the fuck  Does that happen?

[03:03:30]  You'd want  As many original guys  As you could  It's so strange  I saw Ernie Hudson  At one of those  Cons  Oh yes  He wears the outfit  Yes he does  He wears the outfit  And it literally looks like  Somebody took an ashtray  And blew it into his face  He's a little  Little grayish  See I wish  On these days  I wish he would just  Wear a suit  Like Warden Leo Glenn  From Oz  There you go  That's  Yes  I wish he would just  Carry jars of honey  Like Toomer  Because that's how  I know him  Oh hey Toomer

If we even get near him  I don't know if we'll get near him  Seth knows who I am  But I've never met him  I only know because my manager 
[03:07:30]  Is talking to his manager  I hope he would  I'd be embarrassed if I said that  He didn't  That would be a  That's a coup  He's a funny fucking guy  I'm pretty coup  No you're not  He's a good Twitterer  I like his Twitters  Is he?  Yeah yeah  You don't follow him?  No  How many  Do you follow a lot of people?  I probably don't follow many people  You're a Twitter snob  No  I follow  I check a lot of people's Twitter  I check  Yes  A tremendous amount of Twitter  I follow I think 37  Why don't you 
[03:08:00]  No way  More than that  But you check more people than you follow?  Why don't you follow them?  It's annoying to check people  I don't know  Just follow them  Isn't it?  It makes people feel nice  Uh oh  I check them  It's what I do  I hate  I hate when people  Are like  Hey  They  They're like  Hey could you  I got something important to say  Could you DM me?  And then you have to follow  No you don't  To DM them  No you don't  They have to follow you  Oh yeah  But if they ever  But they can't DM you 
[03:08:30]  They can't DM me back  Unless I follow them  Give them an email  A public email  I'm not gonna give them an email address  Make a public email address  No it's easier to just  Anthony's ball's an asshole  I follow them  I follow them  And then wait for the message  If it's something pertinent  Then I'll answer back  How about if it's soggy  And I'll stay follow  Oh boy  No no  That's not even a single  Fucking pea shooter  That's stunk  But if it's something stupid 
[03:09:00]  I will unfollow so quickly  But the fact that I have to do that  Yeah  It annoys me  I hate when they're like  Will you retweet  It's my birthday  And then you go to their  Profile page  And you see  That they have  I've seen it  Where they've literally  Asked 50 people  For retweets  Like their whole timeline  Is just like  At whoever  Retweet it's my birthday  Just everyone  People don't think  You're gonna look  And do a little research  On them  When somebody does  Something on Twitter  Whether they want to  Follow or retweet  Or something  I will look at you  I'll see how many  Follows you have  Oh zero followers 
[03:09:30]  And you have  Three tweets  And they're all  Like shit about me  Oh stop it  First of all  I'm not gonna answer you back  Absolutely not  I'm just gonna block you  First I'll give you  A little message sometimes  Hey dick face  What do you think  I'm gonna get you  Fucking followers  You do give them  You send them something  Sometimes I send them  The direct  I don't even  Hey dick bag  I don't give them  The pleasure of it  And then I usually say  Hope you enjoy  Fucking that  Fatty wife of yours  Jeez  Cause I'm just assuming  And probably right  Yeah but it's even more fun 
[03:10:00]  When you do the research  And then they do  Have the fat wife  Oh it's great  When you go to Instagram  And I did it recently  And there's some guy  And he was being  A dick bag  And then it was his wife  And she's in a Halloween costume  But she's fucking huge  If people don't understand  Like  If I were a more  Venomous person  You know how many times  Like somebody has said  Something shitty about me  And then  You go to their Facebook  Or their Twitter  Or whatever  And there's pictures  Of their kids all over  Material up the ass  And you're like  I could start fucking  With your kids 
[03:10:30]  Yeah you gotta do it  No  Uncle Paul  The kids are asking  For you to do it  Wearing them knickers  Not that way  Oh my god  Well okay  I agree with that  You know what it is  Oh knickers  They think that  Because you're a public figure  You're not gonna notice them  Or they want you to notice them  They know everything about us  We know nothing about them  They're not gonna notice them  But not that much  So okay  They're only opposing  Their kids and wife  That's why they're such  Most of them are such cowards  I respect the guy  That uses his real name  But it does open you up  It's like 
[03:11:00]  But they don't want that  They want to just fire out  And hide behind mommy's apron  They don't want you to see  What a fucking fat pig  They're married to  Exactly  What about that fucking woman  That she tweeted about  You talking about Rodney King  And she was all mad  Oh this is why  You're not famous  Oh fatso  Oh is that fatso  Or the other one  Fatso  No she was that  She was some black chick  I guess  There's one with glasses  I just tweeted back  About being fat  Yeah  I like that one  I saw that picture  But this one  She didn't even have a picture  Oh yeah  But I looked through  Some of her tweets 
[03:11:30]  And she had pictures  Of her kid  And shit like that  And of course  She's you know  Raising a child alone  The only thing I like  Is insults with grammar mistakes  Oh yeah  Because then  I'm just the king  Of retweet with the correction  That is  Sometimes that works  It gets people so mad  That you're not  You're not paying attention  To their point  Right  You're just criticizing  You're actually  Their spelling  You're retweeting the insult  And then you're just  Pointing out that  They use then  Instead of then 
[03:12:00]  Or the wrong there  Yes  There and they are  And I don't even  Block them after that  It's amazing  That one is like  Number fucking one  Yeah  Someone's telling me  Stan Shaw was tumor  What  I don't know about that  I always thought  That was  Ernie Hudson  Yes  That's why I'm like  I don't think  That was Tuma  Hey Tuma  Who was Stan Shaw  I don't know why  I don't know which one that was  I'm gonna hurt you red  Yeah  I really thought 
[03:12:30]  That was  Stupid bees  Oh you know what  I believe I'm wrong  Maybe it is Stan Shaw  I was confusing him  And Ernie Hudson  Ernie is not  Tuma  Oh my fault  Oh you know how glad I am  I didn't meet him  I loved you as Tuma  Oh that guy  Let me see him  Yeah that guy ain't  Ernie Hudson  I know him  But you can see like  In that picture right there  Yeah  That resembles Ernie Hudson  That's racist  He was in a lot of movies  Back in the day  Wait is that him  In all those pictures  Yeah  He looks a lot like  Ernie Hudson  Yeah he kind of does  Yeah 
[03:13:00]  That's racist though  No it's not  Look at that picture  Of Tuma up there  But it is racist  That looks like  Fucking Ernie Hudson man  Yeah  Yeah  Doesn't he look like  Sugar Ray Leonard  Oh Harlem Nights  Is that him  Oh I always thought  That was Ernie Hudson  Fuck me  There he is right there  Yeah  Hey wait a minute  That's Richard Pryor  That's a different guy  You keep saying  The same guy Danny  Oh  You're right Chip  Yeah I know  Okay  Good thing I ain't left 
[03:13:30]  That's good  That was not good  Use that one  I'm right cause I ain't left  My mother would say that  Use that  Man he was  In movies  Long enough ago  To have kind of  An afro or something  What was that  Is that him right there  That was him  Is that him  Oh yeah  Yeah  Motherfucker  Oh yeah  I can't believe  I fucked that up  It's alright  We forgive you  No but  I'm like he's convinced  How old is that  Fucking guy now  I don't know  What website this is  But it's the NNDB  You wanna give that a whack  NNDB  Well

[03:16:30]  He was trying to get  Shatner's attention  Because he wanted to be  On Shatner's  MyOuterSpace.com show  And of course by the way  I bought Facebook  At 31 something  And it just went down  I can't win  No you re-bought  Yeah I wanted to buy  And it went down  I want my money back  That's the trick  Is to buy high  And sell when it's  Nice and low  Yes motherfucker  I'm worthless  I bought some  Apple options  Oh good  What are you making  An apple sandwich  Yeah apple  Apple sandwich  You couldn't say  Apple pie  That's so stupid  He just doesn't get it

[03:17:30]  That's right  My duty sandwich  Was Pepperidge farm  And then a car ran it over  That's fucking fantastic  My favorite animation  From the animation fest  Years ago  Was Jim's childhood stories  Animated  Oh  With the throwing  Of the fucking  The flaming mattress  And the fucking  The hot  The hot  What was it  Chocolate on the car seat  And the old guy  Was it animated?  It was ice cream  You threw ice cream  In his convertible  We didn't know  He put it  It was an ice cream sundae 
[03:18:00]  On the back of his car  And then he drove by  And his wife is wiping  His back off  His wife is cleaning  His back off  What a prick  And then the other one  Where you threw that cup  Of piss  Of piss  Yeah  Out the window  And the guy put his arm up  And it fucking  Hit him and his girl  It exploded everywhere  It wasn't even a great animation  There's just to me  Nothing funnier  It was fucking hilarious  Than destructive teenagers  Who don't understand  Consequences  Stories  It's great  Just like  No regard for a person's feelings  None  No regard for the fact 
[03:18:30]  It's illegal  And it's just like  You're dangerous  What was the guy's name  That would  Oh, Looch  And then there was Stan  But Looch was the guy  Stan  Hey, Stanley  Hey, Stanley  Let's get some  Let's go back  And throw some hot oil  On him  That's brother Mike  Hey, Stanley  Let's go back  And throw hot oil  He wanted to throw  Engine oil  On the guy's bare chest  What an asshole  He was great  We were 13  Hot engine oil  On the guy's chest  That's fucking archaic 
[03:19:00]  Wow  Yeah, we should really  He did a documentary  That guy, Stan  Did he?  I told you  Oh, right  On what?  What was it?  I figured he was in  The movie theater  He's a big dude, man  Creep  Yeah  He was a nice guy, though  Was he?  Yeah, he just enjoyed  Silly  Cool  We should do another  Animation thing  It was so good, man  We absolutely should  We were going to do a roast  We didn't do that  Yeah  All the stuff we talk about  We don't do  We got to do a roast  We got to do an animation thing  The animation thing  Was so fucking much fun  How many talented motherfuckers 
[03:19:30]  Are there out there?  None  Which was the amazing part of it  I know  No, there's a lot of them  Really, really funny  It was just fucking amazing  The Obi and Anthony roast  Has to happen  Yeah, that one  Without a doubt  That's got to happen  It's fucking  Ugh  All these cartoons were funny  Yeah, they did  We can't just sit around  And wait for Bob Eatman  To do shit  No  I know  I know  The Slaughterhouse one  Is one of my favorites  That was a good one  Jimmy talking about  That was one of the finalists  If not the winner  Yeah, that was fucking great 
[03:20:00]  But there's no reason  Why we couldn't do  A roast at one of these  Live events we're doing  I completely agree  And we should have  Fucking listeners  Come up and roast  That would be funny  Although it would take  Two listeners  Before it just became  N-word jokes  Like always  Anytime we let them  Oh, whatever  Whenever we fucking  Deal with them  Oh, here we go  I think I found it  Oh  Hey  We drive by with cups  And throw urine on people  In New Brunswick  That was our favorite activity  See, it's a terrible animation  We would drive around  Me and my friend Looch 
[03:20:30]  He was like 35  And he hung out with the teenagers  That was a creepy guy  Yeah, he drove a fucking  Volkswagen Bug  And we would drink  And I would piss into cups  And we would just drive through  New Brunswick  And throw it on people  And I fucking  I had  I would leave the little  Oh, we got some good ones  And I fucking  Had a plastic  Cup with a plastic lid on it  And I'll never forget  There was a couple walking  And I fucking threw it  And the arc was beautiful  And the guy put his arm up  To block it  And it hit his arm  And  Exploded 
[03:21:00]  Piss went all over him  And his girl  We found one time  The holy grail  We were in a parking lot  And we found a half a dish  Of melted chocolate ice cream  And there was an open car window  With one of those  Fur seat backs  Oh, we smushed it  All over the seat back  We drove by  Five minutes later  And there was an elderly couple  They had to be in their 70s  And they were outside the car  And he's wiping chocolate 
[03:21:30]  He must have been so hot  Under the collar  They had the pickup truck one time  And they had a couch  A giant old sofa on it  So we set the sofa on fire  And pushed it  Off the truck  Onto the highway  We were hoping a car would hit it  I remember one time  I met my friend Marvin  He was a Puerto Rican Jew  Marvin Schnoll  He was a good friend of mine  We were trick-or-treating  And one guy  We knocked on his door  And he didn't have any  I don't have no candy  No 
[03:22:00]  Poor fuck  So Marvin took his gum out  And put it over the guy's  Peephole at his door  So we're out in the yard  Five seconds later  The older man runs out  And grabs Marvin  And puts him in a headlock  And starts punching  The top of his head  And I just stood there  In my Halloween costume  And watched  Who are you dressed as?  I don't remember  Darth Vader or something  I just watched Marvin  Real evil Darth Vader  Yeah  Wow  That is so goddamn funny  I fucking always skip throne 
[03:22:30]  When I hear Patrice laughing  I know  Yeah, yeah  That couch off the back of the truck  Is like something they would do  In The Good Son or something  When he threw the  Stuffed body off  And just cause a  You know  50 car pile up  A crash  Waiting for a car  To hit a flaming couch  In the middle of the road  Like people would die  You're a terrible boy  Yeah  Mean fucking  You're a bad kid  You weren't thinking  About consequences  No  You didn't think  When you rubbed  All that fudge  And fucking ice cream  On that guy's  Furry back  Strangers  That perhaps  The guy wasn't  Going to be happy  When he got back 
[03:23:00]  That's why  We did it because  Of the consequences  And your parents  Thought you were  A sweet boy  Oh man  He opened his asshole  Probably looked like  The fudge in ice cream  Yeah but  We used to go  Doing pig stickers  We called them pig stickers  Which would be  They had this sharp implement  And we would just  Go into bar parking lots  And jab tires  And pop people's tires  You would fucking  Pop people's tires  People just  Went out for a drink  They were angry  Yeah you know  I was young  You're a bad bad kid 
[03:23:30]  You did hang out  With a fast crowd  Didn't you  Yeah we were very bad  And Looch really  Should have known better  Yeah  I heard he died  I hope that's not true  Whoa did he  Did Looch die  Let me google  Let me give you  His real name  Dan you can look it up  No  It's 10 o'clock  Try that with  P-E and P-A  Looch  Okay  Looch  Looch

[03:34:30]  If I already gave you the info  Okay  Steven Singer  Now  What I learned  On the show today  Is that Anthony  Is better with dioramas  Than he is with girls  That's something I picked up  Eric did you learn anything?  I learned that  Bob Kelly's going to  Purchase an inflatable  Pontoon boat  That's right  Let's play the sweeper  Here comes  What did we learn?  What did we learn? 
[03:35:00]  What did you learn Sal?  That's right  Trial by fire  I learned  That I actually  I love it when  Ant doesn't take any calls  That's not something you learned  No I mean  Yeah  It's not really  I didn't learn anything  Nothing?  What are you an intern?  What do you mean nothing?  You're supposed to be  One of us now  I am  There's no nothing  What did you learn  On the show? 
[03:35:30]  I learned Sal's an idiot  Okay see  Your fumble  Is Roland's recovery  Roland got to use that  For what did he learn?  I learned that  Bette Midler  Performed at  Bathhouses  You got it  With Barry Manilow  Oh my god  It's a twofer  Very good Sal  And that happened  Early in the show  And you know  How I like it  When people's  What did you learn  Happened early in the show  I still learned Sal's  Still an idiot  No that counts Roland  Definitely  You get full credit for that  We'll start with Scott  In Wisconsin  Scott what did you learn? 
[03:36:00]  Hello  Congratulations on your wedding  Thank you very much Scott  I learned that  I learned that Opie  I shit the bed  And he has a sore asshole  Well I guess  I don't know if he has a sore asshole  But yeah that was something  That Jim said  Okay  I mean I kind of did touch  On that already  On after Opie and Anthony  Live  Literally  Minutes if not seconds ago  So I don't know how much  Credit you'll get for that  Eric in New York  What did you learn  On today's  Opie and Anthony show?  I learned the root  Of Anthony's racism  Was when he was  A whoopie kid  At junior high 
[03:36:30]  That's right  That's right  He apparently saw some  Young black kids  Not treating a white girl  Very well  I love  That was probably  My favorite segment  On the show today  I love  Hearing embarrassing  Stories from school  Like I don't know  You weren't a cool kid Eric  When you were in high school  I was just fine  Were you cool?  You weren't one of the cool kids  I don't know  A lot of the cool kids  Were all druggies  Listen if you don't know  Whether or not you were  A cool kid  You weren't a cool kid  Yeah  That answers the question itself  Sure you were  I was not a cool kid 
[03:37:00]  There you go  I humiliated myself plenty  Rowan  That's far from it  Okay  That's what I want to know  Rowan  You have literally  Awkward moments  On a day to day basis  What are some of the  Things that just haunt you  From high school  When  Probably when I thought  Me and my buddies  Were laughing at farts  Like  As you always do  Sure  You guys  I said dude  I'm going to do it in class  And it's going to bring down the house  So you and your buddies  Are sitting around what  At lunch  At lunch  No no  It's at lunch  Between periods  I said dude 
[03:37:30]  I got to fart  But I'm waiting for class  And we're all going to laugh  And I went out so loud  And I looked around  I was the only one laughing  And then you just put your head down  And turned beet red  No the teacher called me up  And said  Why did you fart  I thought it was going to be funny  And then  Everybody just looked at me  Disgusted  All the girls in there  Just staring at you  It's embarrassing  Yeah  I've done so many awkward moments  I remember one time  I was like a freshman  And like  I was leaving  I was leaving school  And like one of the Mexican guys 
[03:38:00]  Like the cool Mexican guys  One of the chulos  Or whatever  Was up there  And like  I was a dork  I was just a skinny little geek  With a  NWO wolf pack t-shirt on  Or something  Just like awful  And he was  There was a pretty hot girl  Up there with him  And he was like  As I was leaving  He goes  Yo Sam  Yo Sam  She wants your number  And you know  I was a dork  But I was aware enough  Of what was going on  Around me  To know  That I was being  Made a fool of  That girl  Did not 
[03:38:30]  Want my phone number  For any reason  Whatsoever  So I was like  Okay what do I do  In this situation  I'm being made fun of  And I go  Oh yeah right  And just tried to keep walking  That's fine  And he goes  No no really  What's your number Sam  Give her your number  And I was like  Okay  I'm gonna have to  Kill this with humor  And he goes  What's your number  She wants your number  And I go  Yeah  It's 911  And it was so bad  Like he even stopped  Like he was like 
[03:39:00]  Oh  I'm not even gonna keep  Making fun of you  That was so awful  I was so  Like I immediately  Like my face turned red  My eyes got water  I just kind of walked  Very fast away from them  Because I was like  That was the worst  Response  I could have  9-1-1  Oh  I could do something stupid  That I always thought  Would be cool  But never worked out  What  Like after either  Movie or TV  Dress up like my favorite actor  Thinking the girls  Will think I'm cool  What  Why don't you do that  I don't know 
[03:39:30]  Like what  What movie  Like  Well for  Like I dressed up  In a suit like Fox Mulder  And I said  I'm gonna get chicks  Nobody  No girl ever thought  The X-Files was like  Oh I wish  I wish I could find a guy  Who dressed like Fox Mulder  Oh and I had the badge too  So  Yeah  Trust me  I  My  My  My  My  My  My  My mom  She was so  She was like  Oh you're like  You're like great  Mijo  And then when I get home  And my dad goes  Why did you leave the house like that  See Roland 
[03:40:00]  You had to  You were Mexican  You should have embraced that  You could have been one of the chulos  You know  You could have just worn a bandana  And like  Dickies  And then Die Hard  I was obsessed with  I go  Oh I'm gonna dress like John McClane  Oh Jesus  Oh trust me  It was  Every time I did it  Did you wear a sandwich board  And walk around the colored areas  The colored areas  That's  Eric  Back in time  Eric you just call them  The colored areas  That was worse than anything  John McClane ever did  Is that what they had in your school  The  Did you hear  Troy did you hear 
[03:40:30]  What Eric just referred  Eric just asked Roland  If he did something  In the colored areas  Of his school  Meaning where  Black kids hung out I guess  The colored areas  Did you go to school in the 50s  Yeah  Jesus  Christ Eric  I told you  I've told you  He's racist Eric  Yeah I wore suits for a month  Thinking that people turn around  Did you hear that Roland  Used to dress as Fox Mulder  With the badge on  From the X-Files  Yeah  Thinking the girls  Would be into that  I got one  I got a good one for you  That's what I wanted to ask  Let me go to Eric first  Yeah I told you  Like we've all 
[03:41:00]  We're all sharing  You weren't a cool kid Eric  You know that  Okay  What would  Do you have any  Humiliating moments  Uh  My y'all broke down  My Range Rover  It pulled a flat  And my dad had to drive  The Bentley  To drive me the rest  Of the way to school  My third nanny  Was such a bitch  We almost uh  Burnt the uh  The art room down  We were learning  Start stop animation  And my friend George  And I were doing  This Godzilla thing  And we couldn't figure out 
[03:41:30]  How to get like  The fire or smoke  To come out of  The Godzilla figure  So we painted  Rubber cement  On the set there  And lit it on fire  Took the shot  But the whole background  Came down on top of it  And started  You know burning  So I was like  Oh what do we do  What do we do  I just grabbed more  Matte paper  And tried to fan it out  And then that  Caught on fire  And we just ran out  Of the room  So the teacher  Had to go  And get a bucket  From the bathroom  That's not humiliating  That's cool  You set a fire  It wasn't intentionally  How's that humiliating 
[03:42:00]  That's not humiliating  At all  You know  That moment  Haunts you to this day  I'm the pyromaniac  Do you  That moment  Like I am haunted  Anytime I think  Of the fact  That I looked  At those two cool kids  One of them being a girl  And said my phone number  Was 9-1-1  As if that's a funny  Sort of smart alecky  You better not mess with me again  Type of thing to say  Like watch out  Making fun of me  Because that's the type of humor  You're going to get in response  9-1-1 
[03:42:30]  Yeah  And you're talking about  Certain fires in classrooms  Come on Eric  You did worse than that  One time  This was  He doesn't want to share  No  Fuck you then  Bye  Bye  You're standing right there  It's not a phone  You're not on the phone  Bye  He hangs up  What did you do  Yeah  Bye  At one point  I thought those pullover  Starter jackets were cool  Yeah but everybody did  Yeah  They were cool  At one point  But I got the really  Really bad one  The one 
[03:43:00]  The Colorado Rockies  That was just white and purple  Yeah but didn't you say  You did that in 93-94  Yeah  That was when they were  A new team  Everybody was wearing  Rockies gear  It looked horrible  People yelled at me  Instead of hey where's Skully  They go hey Roland  Where's David or Ken  And I'm like no Skully  You see  That's humiliating  And then I get pushed down  Troy I want to ask you  Because like now  You're like the cool guy  Not really  But you weren't  You weren't a cool guy  Fuck no  When did you start being like 
[03:43:30]  Okay I'm going to be like  The guy with the tats  And the hairstyle  And the  No I never  I never was cool  The only thing that I did  Was I found out  How to play music  And that just  You could be weird  And sort of look like  Come across as you're  A little bit cool  But when did you start  To be like acceptable  Like even  Because there are even guys  Like even when you're  In high school  If you play music  It's a fine line  Because you could still  Be a weirdo  Who nobody likes  He just plays guitar  Yeah it wasn't until  After high school  Way after high school 
[03:44:00]  And then you were like  People were like okay  And I was playing in bands  But when I was in third grade  I was  So it was not until  You were in bands  That people were like  He's cool  Yeah I guess  I mean I don't  Eric thought you were  A cool guy  When he met you  Oh yeah  Is that right  You did right Eric  Okay  God damn it Eric  Go ahead  He won't admit to anything  Of course you thought  He was cool  That's why you hung out  With him and fixed  The radio charts  So his band  Would get played  He wasn't in that band  Well that could have been  For the other  That could have been  For the band  But anyway  But anyway 
[03:44:30]  So I was obsessed  When I was a kid  With the monkeys  Like hey hey  Were the monkeys  Sure  Okay I was too  And I had begged my mom  For months  Months  To let me go get a perm  Like Mickey Dolan's  Cause he had real curly hair  Yeah and you wanted to look  Like Mickey Dolan's  I wanted to  How old were you?  Third grade  And you wanted a perm?  Yeah  So I begged my mom  To take me to get a perm  And I walk into school  With a big head of curly hair  Here we come  Exactly  And uh 
[03:45:00]  How quickly did you realize  What a big mistake it was?  I rocked it  I rocked it  I owned it  Everybody's like  Where the hell did  Why do you have curly hair now?  Yeah  And I was like  Oh this is my natural curl  Was it?  No  You weren't humiliated though  I was  When I look at the pictures now  You go like  I was like  I look like a fucking douche bag  What was I thinking?  Like you're just looking at it  Like even owning it  Was like  I look like an asshole  Yeah  Owning that  Yeah  Ugh  I once in  In sixth grade  I was  I was 
[03:45:30]  For a day  The smelly kid  Because my dog  Got sprayed by a skunk  In the morning  And my dad  Didn't realize  That he stunk  And so he let the dog  In the house  And he jumped on  Everybody's bed  To wake everybody up  And everything  And so all  Me  My brother  And my sister  All went to school  Smelling like a skunk  Oh jeez  And everybody was like  You got sprayed by a skunk  This morning  And I was like  No  My dog did  Which is just the worst excuse  You could ever come up with  But I was just being avoided all day  Because I smelled horrible  Like a skunk 
[03:46:00]  I'm surprised they didn't send you home  No  They let me stay the entire day  Being ridiculed  For being this stinky kid  So what did you have to do  Go home and bathe in tomatoes?  I was  Because  I guess because it was just  Peripheral skunk stench  After I washed my clothes  And took a shower  I was fine  But the dog had to get  The tomato juice bath  Like a couple of them  I was called main course  Main course?  Because my dad  Since he was a chef  Gave me  Instead of like  Kids get peanut butter jelly sandwiches  I had like a steak sandwich  And different sides  So when I sat down at lunch 
[03:46:30]  I put everything around me  And then  People saw  And they started screaming  Hey main course  Isn't it funny that like  And then they knocked down my food  Isn't it funny that  Dads don't even realize  Like parents sometimes  They think they're like  Oh this  I'm going to give him  All the benefits  And not realizing  They're destroying your life  Yeah  You're ruining everything  Just give me the same shit  Everybody else has  From  For the next  Once you get into first grade  For the next 12 years  Just give me the same shit  That everybody else has  And I'll be fine 
[03:47:00]  But I just need to look exactly  Like everybody else does  Because if it's any better or worse  It's going to make life very difficult  It did  Unless I'm setting classrooms on fire  Right Eric?  Parabinia?  Mmhmm  What's wrong Eric?  Nothing  I was just trying to think of something  It's not coming?  Well  But they're not to the level  That you guys are at  Like  I remember when I was really young  I used to wear matching sweatsuits  Like you know how  You would wear like sweatpants to gym  Or something like that  But I would wear 
[03:47:30]  The matching sweatshirt top  But that was my  Outfit for the day  For school  So I'd be walking around  Like in an all red  Yeah but you did it regularly  So you must have thought  It was cool  You couldn't have been humiliated by it  No  Well if you look back at it  It's pretty fucking  But nobody made fun of you  They're like oh  My hair wasn't done  I had bad glasses  Oh here comes Nagel  He sucks but he's rich  We gotta pretend he's cool  We're gonna go party at his house  Yeah  You were like the girl  From super sweet 16 or whatever  It's like yeah  She's a bitch 
[03:48:00]  But we gotta pretend to like her  So we get invited  People had to do that  Cause my cousin  Who's the same age  Same grade  And everything  She was one of the really  Popular kids  Did you fuck her?  Ew no  Alright just asking  Good question  So you know  Whenever you went over  To her house  Or something like that  You had all these other kids  Had to like fake be nice  Oh here comes Nagel  I wanna ride  He sucks so much  But I just wanna ride his boat  My mom has a picture of me  Dressed as Indian Jones  And it wasn't Halloween  Why were you dressing up 
[03:48:30]  Like movie characters  And going to school?  I thought they were cool  I was like  If they're cool on screen  I'm gonna be cool  So I walked in  By time like 10 minutes is  My jacket was stolen  My hat was knocked off  I got my Linnea Jones satchel on  They just beat you up  It's so damaging  I remember like  My first day of school  When we moved to England  Three kids ran up to me  And they were like  Hey we hate you  And punched me in the stomach  I was like what the fuck?  You're so mean  Yeah  Why would you do that to someone?  You don't even know me  How could you hate me?  I was a retard 
[03:49:00]  Cause they walked  You were a retard  You were a retard?  Cause two kids  What are you Zach Galifianakis  In the hangover?  No  Cause two kids go  Hey we're supposed to show you  The high school  I was like oh awesome  Follow us  I was walking  And then we turned around  And like  Wizard rooms  Boom  Took my money and everything  Did you ever get beat up  Or anything Eric?  No I didn't get beat up  But one kid chased me  With a chain  I was riding my bike  And I was like 6th grade  And he was I think  8th 9th grade  Him and his friends 
[03:49:30]  Started chasing me  And I went up in a tree  And he's just sat there  With this big chain  You ran up a tree?  Yeah  And he's sitting there  With a chain  Just whipping it against the tree  You were always just  Kind of lost weren't you?  I did my own thing  I mean no  That's not the same  As being lost  I think you were always  Kind of lost  You're like I guess  It's cool to wear  Track suits to school  Just you saw  You saw somebody on TV  Wearing it  So you're like I guess  It wasn't track suits  It was just regular  Like those cheap sweat suits  That you would buy  Like at the  Like at Marshalls  Or something  Like Bob Hope wears 
[03:50:00]  Yeah  That's what it is  What about you Sal?  I was really into like  Grunge  At a  But didn't you go to school  In like 2000  No no no  Like early 90s  I was really into like  What year were you born?

I was like you know  Maybe like six  Five or six  And I cut  I cut like you know  The strategic hairs  Out of my  Corduroy pants  And I thought  At least that's cool  Like I just wanted  To look like wrestlers  When I was five or six  I couldn't wait for Halloween  So I could come to school  Dressed like the Undertaker  Yeah no I just wanted  To be Eddie Vedder  Pretty much  Or you know  That's like a good thing  Like for a  Well I don't  Well yeah in 96  It was still cool right?

Towards the end  Of 11th grade  And you were just  Mr. Casanova

Girl  Or guy  Girl I was dating  For like three months  Oh  Yeah  Was she hot?  At the time she was yes  Do you think about her? 
[03:53:00]  No  Why?  I dated her for like four years  And  Why'd you break up with her?  She kind of just  Started seeing somebody else  And didn't tell me  She started cheating on you  Yeah  Why wouldn't you just say  She was cheating on me?  She kind of started  Seeing somebody else  And not telling me  Yeah  While we were dating  After four years  Yeah  Were you heartbroken?  Was that your first heartbreak?  That was pretty devastating  Yeah  Was she your first love?  No  But that was  The first long time  A hoagie was his first love 
[03:53:30]  So is that when you started  Packing on the pounds  After that?  No  It wasn't until  I think 2006  So when would you  If you were like  Cool in high school  Were you cool  If you were cool in high school  When did you start  Not being cool?  Because like  Surely the question is  When did you start being cool?  So like  When did the shift change?  Fucking asshole  What?  You're not exactly  The big man on campus  Around here Eric  I'm not trying to be  I'm still 
[03:54:00]  That's fine  I'm not saying  Whether it's by design or not  But you're like  When did you not  When did you stop being like  I've always done  What I wanted to do  Which is what?  Whatever I wanted to do  At the time  Mr. Don't give a fuck  Mr. Eric Nagel in the house  I do what I want  He dances as a beat of his own drummer  Yeah  Unless Obie tells him otherwise  Yeah right  Oh shit  You looking forward to  Obie coming back?  Sure  You are just a 
[03:54:30]  Cavalcade of conversation  Danny and Buffalo  Hey  What's up?  I had one of those  Embarrassing things  From high school  I wanted to be like  One of the punk kids  And they always wore those  Black jackets  With like patches on them  So I got a bunch of patches  Of bands like The Clash  And I don't know  Other bands I never listened to  Yeah  And put them on a  Hoodie  And started walking around  School with it  And one of my friends  Just came up to me  And was like  Dude  What are you doing?  It was really embarrassing 
[03:55:00]  And you had to be like  Did he start asking you  I like The Clash  I just started listening  No  He knew  I didn't listen to him  He just knew  I was trying to fit in  And he kind of just told me  Hey  Come on  What'd you tell him?  I just  I got really embarrassed  And never wore it again  Uh huh  Alright  But you learned  Yes  It still haunts you though  Doesn't it?  Yeah  As soon as you guys  Talked about it  I was just like  Oh I remember this  That 911 thing  I swear to god  Is the worst thing  I ever did in my life  It's not that bad 
[03:55:30]  I was so humiliated  When I said it though  Of course  But I mean  You just  You learn  Right?  I mean  Yeah  You have to go through  Those embarrassing  Absolutely  Like every  Every  That's the best part  By the time  Senior year of high school  Hit  I was pretty well  Informed on how to  You got it a little  Figured out  Yeah  Yeah  Were you getting late  In high school?  No  I didn't  I mean like  The girl we were  Talking about yesterday  I didn't really  Have a girlfriend  Until  The end of junior year  Of high school? 
[03:56:00]  High school  And yeah  No I didn't lose  My virginity  Until I was 18  Yeah  Yeah  Was that in college?  No I think  It was probably around  The same time as Eric  Yeah  Maybe the summer  Maybe before the summer  I don't know  It was around then though  Was it awkward?  Yeah yeah yeah yeah  I think everybody's  First experience is always  Insanely awkward  Yeah we didn't know  What the fuck we were doing  And I like  I was scared  So I probably could have  Lost my virginity way sooner  But I didn't want to  Go buy condoms  That you were just  Embarrassing with condoms?  Yeah I didn't want to  Go buy them 
[03:56:30]  See I stole them  You just shoplifted them?  Shoplifted them  How old were you?  When I lost my virginity?  14  Okay so you're a little cooler  Well not really  Here's what happened  You were just like  What's up?  I'm down for whatever  I just need to figure out  What that is  You in babe?  No I had a crazy  Troy Triggles  I had a crazy aunt  She was out of her mind  You fucked your aunt?  No no no  I'm telling you  No listen  Oh sorry  She stayed with me  To watch me  While my mom and my stepdad  Were away  And she was like  You're 14  She's like  Have you had sex yet?  I said no 
[03:57:00]  She's like  Well you need to get laid  What?  Your aunt?  Yeah  I wish I had family members  Like this  Like aunt and his dad  Hooking up with Buzz  I wish I had a Buzz  I wish I had a Buzz in my life  When I was 13  So listen to this  So my aunt went  And bought alcohol  And she's like  Do you know any slutty girls?  What?  At 14?  How could you know  Any slutty girls?  Well I remember  There was this girl  Named Stephanie  Who would  She had sex  With this other kid  In the locker room  At school  What?  Yeah  So I was like  Well I know she's a slut  Because she did that  Right  She's like  Well call her over 
[03:57:30]  So my aunt went  And picked her up  What?  Picked her up  Did your parents know  This was happening?  No  Do they know now?  No  No  No  No  But so they  They don't listen  They picked her  We went and picked her up  We brought her over  And we hung out  And my aunt got her drunk  And I went and had sex with her  Was it great?  No  It was weird  It was weird  And I just remember  The only thing I remember  So the girl  We turned out  She was indeed a slut  Yeah  That's great  And then I  The only thing I remember  From it is  Michael Jackson's  Black or white  Was playing 
[03:58:00]  So every time I hear that  I think about  And then my  Then for my 15  I didn't get laid  Until my 15th birthday  Again  After that?  Yeah  So it was like  Almost a year  Almost a year  And this one girl  Was like  What do you want  For your birthday?  I said  I want to have sex with you  And she was  You said that to the girl  Alright  I tell you  You were never a dork  No  I just  I just said  I was just very blunt  She's like  Okay  Yeah exactly  I was still like  Oh shit  The new Stone Cold  Figure is out  I gotta go to  KB Toys Bob 
[03:58:30]  You didn't want to  Fuck at 15?  No no no  I couldn't buy condoms  At 18  I was fucking scared  As shit  I wanted to fuck  I wanted to fuck  No those girls  Were scary to me  Nah  Right Roland?  Those girls  They are scary  I would go  Do I want them?  I was like  No  Like I was literally  Just thinking today  How different high school  Would be now  If you could go back  With just  With the knowledge  Just put your brain  In your little kid self  You'd  Fuck everybody  I would try to  Every girl  I'd still put this  Yeah  You'd be like  Oh sweet 
[03:59:00]  I'm a little kid again  I could buy D.I. Joe  Hey Sam  Did you ever  Like say now  Or recently  Did you ever find out  That there were  Opportunities in high school  That you were oblivious to  Or just had no idea  That that's  Where the girl  Was going with it?  I remember  It was the worst  Like  When I was a junior  And I just started  Dating this girl  Who you know  Was my first serious girlfriend  Another girl  Who I'd had a crush  On her forever  And I was just like  I just gave up  And we were just  Friendly at this point 
[03:59:30]  She was like  You know  I had such a crush  On you freshman year  And I was like  What?  Like why the fuck  Would you tell me  That junior year?  She was like  Oh you know  I didn't think  You were interested  Well you were wrong  But I was obviously  Giving off some kind  Of gay vibe  Because she didn't  Think I was interested  But yeah  No  It's the worst  Possible thing  When you realize  There were opportunities  Especially like  Ant says  Like if you were  In a relationship  Or you were doing  Something that was  Just a waste of your time  Like I was dating  This girl when I was 
[04:00:00]  In college  And I think back now  At the opportunities  That were in college  To this dumb chick  That I should have  Broken up with  Before I left for college  Because it was  The entire time  I was in college  That period of our  Relationship  Was a waste of time  Why did you cheat on her  To see how your cake  And eat it too  I should have  She's probably  Cheating on you right  That's why we ended  The relationship  Well it was complicated  But so on  So you should have  Gone crazy  Of course I should have  Gone crazy  I should have cheated  On her every day  Of my life  Yeah  But these are things  We look back on 
[04:00:30]  I had one of those  Yeah  Where one of the cheerleader  I found out like  Two years ago  Really liked me  When I was like a freshman  She goes  Why don't you come up  To my house  And you're like  You have no TV  No way  Yeah  But I didn't know  That was a coach  For sex  I was like  I have a bigger TV  In my place  I'll just go  I'll just go watch  My own TV  I got video games  Some words  She'll just come on over  I go no I got video games  But Troy was Mr. Cool  I was not  You were asked  On your 15th birthday  You told a girl  You wanted to have sex with her  Right  But listen to what happened 
[04:01:00]  So she's like  Okay  So we were in my garage  So we laid down  On the floor in my garage  See that's awesome  For my birthday  And I literally like  It literally went in  Because you're so wound up  You're so super charged  At 15  And it literally like  My tip touched it  And I was like  That's it  I'm done  Well yeah you're 15  And she's like  Well happy birthday  I was like okay  It was a rip off  No it sounds pretty great  Yeah but it's like  You don't even get it in  It's not even inside  Yeah but you're  You're done anyway  Plus you  The whole point is 
[04:01:30]  You asked a girl  When you were 15  If you could have sex with her  She said yes  And then you came  That's the story  That is the story  Like I'm sorry  You weren't like  But I don't even know  If it actually entered  But you came  So it's finished  Yeah  Like I'm sorry  That you weren't  Like a marathon man  When you were 15  On your second time  But you at least  Want to feel it  Now you know that  I felt it  Now when I was 15  I was scared to feel it  I didn't want to feel it  Were you jerking off at 15  I think so  Right around then  Yeah I probably didn't  Really start jerking off  Until I was 14 or 15 
[04:02:00]  Yeah  You know  Because I didn't want to  I was watching wrestling  And you didn't want to fuck  No  I was scared  What were you thinking  About when you jerked off  Look at those guys  Fucking that's awesome  Wrestlers  You're jerking off to wrestlers  I didn't say wrestlers  Who were you jerking off to  The people in the porno  And you didn't want to do that  No  I wanted to observe that  I wasn't ready for it  That's weird  I knew that  I'm not ready for that  I said that to him  I'm not ready for that  I was watching pornos  That like  Because I didn't look  At these people in the pornos  As people who were like me  I was like no  Those guys are fucking different  I'm not ready for that 
[04:02:30]  I was watching pornos  In 7th grade  6th grade  I was like I need to be doing this  No  Not me  I was like that is a different breed  Of human being right there  That is not Sam Roberts  Come to find  I was capable of those actions  You're prude  Come to find  You're fucking prude  Well yeah  At 15 I'm sorry  I guess I was a bit of a prude  But come to find  You know  What about you Sal  Me?  Yeah  I don't know  I went through that awkward stage  In middle school  Where you know  You're just sleazing on girls 
[04:03:00]  And they just  They give you the wrong signals  And all those  When are you planning on losing your virginity?  I think maybe once I get married  Yeah you think so?  I think I just want to settle down  When did you?  I was 16  See Sal's like another cool guy  Me and Robin  No I wasn't cool  I wasn't cool dude  I was just a little  Skinny  Little awkward wrestling fan  Who wore size large t-shirts  For some reason  With a big head  In 8th grade  I finally mustered the courage  To a girl  I go hey  Want to meet me at the movies  Like thinking I asked her out  Yeah  So I went early  Bought two tickets  Her and her friend came by 
[04:03:30]  I go I got two tickets  She grabbed him  And what I did  See this is the life  That Roland and me lead  You can't relate  See I was in 6th grade  I was in teenage  I went to see Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles  In the theater  And I got to second base  For the first time  See this is what  I had popcorn and candy  Remember when  I had that conversation with you  That there's  There's a certain level  That you  Can't relate to Roland and me on  This is what we're talking about  That's not true  Yes it is  This is what we're talking about  You don't understand  What's there not to understand  You don't get it  I just went for it 
[04:04:00]  Exactly  We are not  We were not capable of that  And there's  There's a little kernel  Of that scared  15 year old  And that little kernel  Is probably bigger in Roland  Than it is in me  But  That's still in us  Yeah but look what happened  And you're  And you're still the guy  Who at 15 was like  You know what I want  For my birthday  I want to fuck  Whereas I was the guy  At 15 that was like  You know what I want  For my birthday  They just made a new gold dust action figure  That's what I want  See that doesn't  That doesn't make  That's like little kid 
[04:04:30]  Like you didn't grow up  Like I was like  Ready to fucking grow up  Yeah no not me  Like my balls dropped  Like I was sprouting pubes  I was like  Let's fucking do this  Not me  I was like  Get back in there pubes  I'm not ready for you yet  My voice never fucking changed  That's true  His balls never dropped  Roland is still waiting  For those balls to drop  Come on balls  It's like New Year's  And Dick Clark  Just can't finish that countdown  He just stuttered  Well listen  We got to talk about  Roland going on a bike ride  The other day  Oh okay  Let's save that for tomorrow  Okay
