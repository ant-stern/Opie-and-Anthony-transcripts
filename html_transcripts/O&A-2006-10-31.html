<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a humorous, fictional news report about a rage-inducing virus, seguing into promotion of their upcoming Halloween party at the Hard Rock Cafe, specifying a "no pregnant nun" costume rule and ticket giveaways.  A substantial portion focused on the fallout from their "Fatty Pig Fatty" contest, including discussion of a critical blog post and online comments.  The hosts commented on the winner, "Honey," deeming her behavior "uppity."  A microphone malfunction, smelling of "rusted" chicken wings, led to a new Lysol-spraying protocol.  A caller, Dan, referenced a prior, potentially controversial segment. Opie mentioned a family connection to All the Way May, from *A League of Their Own*.

The show sarcastically criticized Oprah Winfrey's audience giveaway and Tyra Banks' beauty cream giveaway.  Listener calls covered horror movie fears, driving habits, and further commentary on the celebrity giveaways.  The hosts promoted their upcoming *FHM* magazine feature and "Walkover Talent Show."  Marge, from an animal shelter, called to request help with the substantial veterinary bills for Bob Hope, a dog with rectal cancer whose condition improved after a shelter worker took him home. The hosts made numerous jokes about Bob Hope's illness.

The "Fatty Pig Fatty" contest dominated much of the show, with the hosts responding to criticism with highly offensive and misogynistic language towards a commenter, Sue Ann, and other overweight women, using derogatory terms and making sexually explicit comments. They discussed the economic disadvantages faced by overweight women.  Numerous callers reacted, both supporting and criticizing the contest, fueling further offensive jokes.  The show also included dark humor about the Halloween curfew for registered sex offenders.  Audio clips from *Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories*, featuring the hosts' offensive and humorous voice work as various characters (E-Rock, Than, Derek, Steve), were played, along with a call from Honey, the "Fatty Pig Fatty" winner, who couldn't collect her oversized check. Laszlo from Rockstar Games promoted the game.  The "walkover" to their XM radio broadcast was detailed, including Club Soda Kenny's "Monster Mash" performance and an impromptu "investigative report" at a Dwayne Reed's, searching unsuccessfully for sex toys.  The Halloween party was again promoted.

A discussion about the difference in quality between early 1980s and modern movie trailers transitioned into their "Evacuator" spoof trailer, featuring offensive and violent jokes. Listener calls followed, along with a sexually suggestive "Release" gum commercial spoof. They discussed a local news segment featuring a Gilligan and the Skipper impersonation, the Black Sabbath reunion, and a segment with Roland, the guest booker, pitching Cold War Kids, whose song "Hang Me Up To Dry" was played and criticized.  Paul R. Nelson's campaign promotion was played, followed by a lengthy, graphic discussion about Jim Norton's unhygienic bathroom experience.

Anthony graphically described his uncomfortable rectal exam, prompting sexually explicit banter. Paul R. Nelson called in to promote his campaign ad criticizing his opponent's spending on sex studies.  Further crude jokes and listener calls followed.  Music from The Mathematicians was played, and Opie's prolonged diarrhea was discussed.  Upcoming events, including the Hard Rock Cafe Halloween party with Flavor Flav, were promoted, concluding with Club Soda Kenny's "Monster Mash" performance.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the O.P. and Anthony show on XM202 featuring O.P., Anthony, and James Norton.  It's different. The infection was everywhere. It was in the street outside. It was coming through your windows. It was a virus.  Terrible viral infection gives people this incurable disease. Kills their veins and blood with their pure rage.  By the time they tried to evacuate the cities, it was already too late.  Jesus Christ, five hours? It infects, replicates, and kills this fast? These numbers can't be right.  The numbers aren't correct. I wish to God they weren't. 
[00:00:30]  It's that one.  There is no God.  It's like some kind of horror movie.  It's such a great virus that you want to infect others like your friends and co-workers.  Sometimes it leaves puftsules. There's nothing you can do about it.  God Almighty.  You've got to stop this outbreak before it mutates.  They're highly contagious.  What's this rash from?  We're facing a new strain.  It can cause life-threatening bleeding or even asphyxiation.  Where is it spreading?  All over the place.  All right.  We're coming out.  Here we go.  I'm a boredom. 
[00:01:00]  Anthony.  I'm a little dirty.  Wipe me.  James Norton.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Happy Halloween. 
[00:01:30]  Happy Halloween.  Oh, scary.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  Yes, Steve.  We're doing radio all day today.  Oh, it's a mountain.  That's what we do today.  We do our regular show now.  And then tonight we're broadcasting our Halloween show that I guess will be played back tomorrow morning. 
[00:02:00]  Is that how it's working?  Yes.  How is that?  I don't know.  Doing two shows.  Gonna have to nappy.  Yeah, it's gonna be a big nap.  Gonna take a nappy.  Big nap in between.  Halloween party's at the Hard Rock Cafe tonight.  The last batch of tickets we'll be giving away today when we do the walkover from here to XM Satellite Radio.  It's gonna be a good time tonight, though.  We got some surprises. 
[00:02:30]  Yeah.  Uh, I'm looking forward to the costume contest.  Yes.  Because every year it's very, very interesting because we ask the fine listeners to come with a costume that has something to do with the Opie and Anthony show.  Something to do with the program, yes.  For example, if you're planning on coming to our party tonight dressed as a pregnant nun, go find another party.  Get out.  Get out!  You're not welcome here.  I don't mean that for the people in the costume.  I mean it for the people that know who they are. 
[00:03:00]  You're not welcome here.  Now, we're looking for costumes that have something to do with the Opie and Anthony show.  Yes.  And the listeners never disappoint.  There'll be some fine, fine costumes tonight and a nice cash prize.  We need Lysol.  Why?  What happened?  I don't know.  This is a little weird.  What?  The mic?  Yeah.  I hate Michael.  Oh!  It was bad, too.  I hate Michael.  Smell yours, Jimmy. 
[00:03:30]  Smell it.  Jimmy's eating.  Just smell it.  I have milk in my mouth.  No.  Just spray it right into it, man.  What is it?  It's like rusted.  No, that's food.  That's probably a good cough.  It's probably a good cough.  Yeah, maybe some chicken wings.  Do I have that?  Some remnants from some fine chicken wings in your microphone.  You hear that?  It's me cleaning my mic.  Nothing to worry about.  Don't be alarmed.  Oh, yeah.  Something just fell out of it.  Ew.  Ew.  It fell out on the mouse pad over here. 
[00:04:00]  Are you kidding?  It's disgusting.  We're professional broadcasters, by the way.  Thank you, sir.  Shouldn't this be done beforehand?  Here's a new thing.  I like the new thing.  Here's a new thing.  I like the new thing.  Before we come on in the morning,  the mics are to be sprayed lightly with Lysol  and then kind of brushed off with a tissue  because that is effing disgusting. 
[00:04:30]  It just is.  It smells good now.  You ever pick something out of the microphone and eat it?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's usually tasty, but kind of gross if you think about it.  I'll pick it out.  If there's moisture in it, I'll just sniff it.  But if it's dry, I'll eat it.  Yeah.  Put it between your two front teeth and just nibble on it.  Nibble.  Nibble, nibble.  Nibble, nibble.  Yum.  So anyway, the Hard Rock Cafe is the place to be tonight  for the Halloween party.  Are we giving away tickets at the door?  I was going to say we should give some way at the door.  I would hope so.  I think so. 
[00:05:00]  Or like I know last year there was a line all night long.  So as people were leaving to go to another Halloween party,  we let others in.  So I think we'll be doing that again this year.  There will be some kind of line.  So if you don't have tickets, you might be able to get in as people leave the party.  Are we all set to broadcast?  All set.  All right.  That's all it takes.  Let's say hi to Dan in Albany.  What's up, Dan? 
[00:05:30]  Hey, Opie.  How about a costume as a nun who just got a deep chaining?  All the way, man.  Yeah.  All the way, man.  He's flashing back to yesterday's later show.  Well, yeah, an XM.  I don't know how it came out, but League of Their Own.  Yeah.  Or a League of Their Own was based on my great aunt.  Well, one of the women, right?  I think that played on the team.  I think Madonna's character. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, my grandma's sister.  She was a great baseball player in her day, but the women weren't really allowed to play  baseball, but they had their fine women's league.  And Babe Ruth commented that he never saw a woman hit better than my great aunt.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  It's legendary in my family.  I swear to God, this isn't some BS thing.  And so it came up on the XM show yesterday, and I was kind of proud to kind of share that  with the audience. 
[00:06:30]  Do you have a nickname?  All the Way May.  All the Way May.  All the Way May.  What does she do now?  So it came out that, yeah, I'm related to All the Way May, the inspiration for A League  of Their Own.  And Jimmy took that opportunity to turn it into something deeply, deeply disturbing.  Well, does she do anything now, All the Way May?  I don't even know if she's alive.  What did she do?  I don't know if I ever met her even.  Maybe at one of these, like, family get-togethers back in the day.  I don't know if she's still alive, right? 
[00:07:00]  She's in her 90s and a nun in Western New York.  A nun.  A nun.  Yeah, yeah.  That's telling.  And that didn't even stop Jimmy on the XM show.  So thank you, Jimmy.  That's what got me started.  Maybe we could throw that bit up on opianthony.com.  Because there's no way we could play it over here.  It had a little bit of everything.  Yeah, it sure did.  It was sexy.  Had a taboo love.  Some taboo love was in there. 
[00:07:30]  A little jungle fever.  Yeah, well.  There's a lot in there.  Yeah, great.  So I'm sure people are going to be going to the party as All the Way May tonight.  That's a quick one.  It's going to get ugly.  The prize money's good.  How much for the winner of the costume contest?  We haven't figured it out yet.  At least $1,000?  $1,500?  $2,000?  Sure.  All right.  We've got to figure out the total, but it's getting up there.  Also today on the program, we announced the winner of the Fatty Pig Fatty Contest.  Fatty Pig Fatty. 
[00:08:00]  H57.com is coming in studio to present the check probably to us.  What?  Well, they want like a nice photo op with the fatty.  All right.  And the current leader is Honey.  Is Honey going to be down at the party?  I don't know.  Honey's from Binghamton, so I don't know if they're making the drive today.  You know something?  The kind of money they should.  For that kind of cash, I want to smash her if she doesn't come down here.  Well, she doesn't play.  She doesn't play.  Yeah.  I'm definitely disappointed in the way we reacted to her when she came in. 
[00:08:30]  But I'll tell you one thing.  Her second appearance, if she ever did come to this thing, or if she doesn't come to this  thing, she'll get smashed until she comes down here and wants to like hit us, I think.  She should definitely be there for the presentation.  Yeah.  Well, we were nice to her.  I don't think that was bad that we were nice to her.  I don't mind that.  No, I don't mind.  It's like, all right, whatever.  But she's got to come down to the presentation.  Well, we all noticed that she was a bit uppity is what Anthony is saying. 
[00:09:00]  And we didn't go after her.  She was.  We didn't go after her for being uppity.  Did anybody read?  I forwarded, I think, just to hope.  I was laughing last night.  It was like one of those stomach-hurting laughs because the Fatty Pig Fatty, somebody didn't  like it.  They blogged about it.  A fat chick.  Yeah.  And Whackbag got a hold of it.  And I clicked on the link from Whackbag.  And the pest attacked this fat girl's blog.  I can't tell you how hard I laughed reading.  Wait, explain further, because I didn't see that yet.  I saw the thread on Whackbag that some fatty was pissed off about the Fatty Pig Fatty 
[00:09:30]  contest and talking about how we're just awful human beings and immature for doing something  like this.  Of course.  Because you're fat.  And I clicked on the link.  And so they started posting comments on her blog.  And it was probably over 200 by the time I had looked at it.  And maybe 10 of them were pro-Sue.  Yeah.  And the other 204 were just, you know, Paul R. Nelson saying something horrible. 
[00:10:00]  And then I approve this message.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  I was.  Who did I forward that to?  I sent that to you.  I don't think you sent it to me.  Maybe I just sent it to Steve.  Well, can we get the guys to get some of the best?  The better posts?  Sent it to Steve.  From that blog?  Yeah.  All right.  They're working on it right now.  Oh, my God.  This is so fun.  Did you read it, Eric?  Oh.  Yeah.  I was giggling like a child last night.  That was very, very cool.  All right.  We got a lot to do.  It is Halloween.  Halloween?  Should we do our Halloween show? 
[00:10:30]  Ooh.  Play scary music in and out.  Play the Monster Mash.  Oh.  Is there a hack radio station out there playing the Monster Mash today?  It's a funny song.  Oh, yeah.  It's a hard smash.  And all kinds of stuff.  It's a scary, funny, scary song.  One-eyed, one-horned, flying purple people eater.  Can we play that one in and out of?  Oof.  Why do you know the words to...  That's the title.  Oh. 
[00:11:00]  Of a different song.  Oh, I don't know.  There's a cool Halloween song.  It's called My Kid's a Burn Victim.  This is the one day a year he likes.  La, la, la, la, la, la.  La, la, la.  Always has to have a la, la, la, la, la.  You know, the only one that's in the spirit of Halloween today is our own Danny.  Danny.  Yeah, Danny, I think, might be showing up in full costume.  Is he showing up in full costume?  Oh, they're all giving me a thumbs up.  Don't tell Jimmy.  Wow.  And I know what he's dressed as. 
[00:11:30]  And you are going to get a really big laugh.  I can't do my costume tonight.  Why?  Because I have to occasionally leave the party once or twice to do a quick practice set.  Practice set.  Damn you.  Am I doing comedy eight months?  Damn you.  I have to, but my costume is going to be a really good one.  You should try to do a practice set in front of those animals.  Some of them might be a letterman.  I can't.  Well, good point.  My costume, I don't want to give away what it was going to look like, but it was going  to be called Boy with a Fancy New Hairdo.  Yeah, I've seen that hairdo.  Dude, you could still do your sets with that hairdo. 
[00:12:00]  I know, it'll be really awful, though.  You should do it.  Thank you.  Yes, because you're just working on material.  That would be funny.  You don't give a crap what the audience, how the audience reacts.  You're just trying to work it out in your own head.  Yeah, you are.  You have to show up at the party tonight with that hairdo.  It's Boy with a Fancy New Hairdo.  It is the old fancy.  I challenge, you know what we should do?  We should have like a bed haircut contest.  Yeah.  It'll be the first annual Jimmy Bed Hair Contest, because Jimmy walked in one day, 
[00:12:30]  with this hairdo.  You had a hat on?  I would say no more.  I like the fact that you just called it a hairdo, too.  A hairdo.  Oh, yeah.  It's got to be called a hairdo, not a haircut.  A hairdo.  We should have.  A 1950s woman hairdo.  What do you say, Jimmy?  Should we start it after Halloween?  Yeah, I would like to see a hairdo competition.  All right, after you get through Letterman, so maybe later this week, you show up with  your haircut, your hairdo.  We'll throw it up online, and then the listeners can get involved and see if they can come up 
[00:13:00]  with a worse hairdo than you.  That's pretty good.  Why not, man?  I love it.  Why not?  I'm sure it'll be sponsored by Supercuts by Monday.  Well, there it is.  There it is.  I'm looking at a picture of one of Jimmy's hairdos.  That's a real lovely one, and you're posing so well.  You look like some type of wax head from a horror movie.  Hey, can we throw that up on opianthony.com?  We could start today.  That is a fake head from a monster movie. 
[00:13:30]  A lot of listeners have seen the hairdo, the haircut.  So why don't we throw it up on opianthony.com?  We'll start the contest today officially.  Send in your photographs and see if you have a better hairdo than the one you're going  to see on opianthony.com.  Can Steve or somebody write this whole thing up on the website?  All right, good.  I've used the same costume for, I think, five years now.  Yeah.  Where I showed up.  I must say, this evening, the Halloween party, new costume for me. 
[00:14:00]  Yeah?  Yes.  Yeah?  I'm going with a new costume.  Ew.  But it's Halloween.  I have to get into the Halloween spirit of things.  It fits the show.  It's topical for, you know, maybe not topical, but it's just, it's something that, you know,  people will identify.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  What about you, Ope?  What are you dressing as? 
[00:14:30]  Oh, boy.  Are you dressing as fuddy-duddy who won't get involved in a fun party?  That's right.  You only decided to start wearing costumes like five years ago.  Five years?  Yeah.  You were a fuddy-duddy just like me for many years.  No, I was a lazy daisy.  All right.  It's going to be a lot of fun.  Once again, the last batch of tickets we'll give away on the walkover today from here to  XF Satellite Radio, so it's at the Hard Rock Cafe, and there will be a line forming there  to get into the party as people leave, because we noticed last year that some of the people 
[00:15:00]  there had to go to other parties, and they made room for new people to come in.  So, yes, that will be happening tonight, okay?  Yep.  All right.  Why don't we go to break with Stephen Lynch singing a little Halloween song?  Ooh.  Is it scary?  Huh?  Is it a scary song?  I hope it's not scary.  I'll get scared.  It's a bit scary.  It's the only Halloween song we want to play today, so.  By the way, do you know who's afraid of scary movies is Dumb Kenny.  He wouldn't watch Sling Blade for a long time because he was afraid it was a scary movie. 
[00:15:30]  Are you kidding?  He wouldn't watch it.  That's not a scary movie.  But he told me, he goes, I thought that was a scary movie.  I was afraid to watch it.  You're afraid of horror movies.  Are you really afraid of horror movies?  I'm scared.  I don't go for that blood and guts stuff.  Why?  I even avoid it in real life, if possible.  It's just a movie.  Yeah, it gives me nightmares.  Like what type of movie?  Slasher movies or the newer type of, like, Japanese movies that have been remade here, 
[00:16:00]  like Grudge and stuff?  There's not, like, blood and guts in those.  I never saw those.  Grudge, saws, nothing, ring, nothing.  See, The Ring isn't really, like, a blood and guts thing,  but it's just really scary and creepy.  When The Exorcist came out, when I was 17 years old,  I sorted a drive-in, and later that night,  I walked with a bat from my car to the front door of my house.  Wow, were you going to beat the Antichrist with a bat?  I don't know.  I used to keep a bat in my car.  I don't know. 
[00:16:30]  Really?  The power of my stupidity compels you.  Somebody told me to watch the movie Seven.  Yeah.  So I rented the movie.  I watched the movie Seven.  Then afterwards, I had to go, like, walk my dog before I went to sleep.  Yeah.  I was so scared, I brought a gun and a flashlight.  And then I was mad at myself that I didn't bring my big gun instead of my little gun.  Why don't you just get a dog that isn't faggoty and can defend you?  You shouldn't have to bring a weapon when you're walking your animal.  A dog and a gun. 
[00:17:00]  I don't do scary stuff.  Wow.  That's too bad.  All right.  No costume for you tonight, Club Soda Kenny?  Come on.  Yeah, I'm coming as big and stupid.  All right, well.  It's a good costume every year.  Big and stupid.  Or every day, for that matter.  All right, here's Stephen Lynch's little Halloween song as we go to break.  Jeez.  What's wrong, Kenny?  I'm scared.  No, I just thought that was funny that you said I'm like that every day.  Oh, my God.  He's the worst. 
[00:17:30]  Oh, creepola.  Just staring at my buzzer, waiting for 5 o'clock.  Can't push the buzzer before 5.  Something might happen to him.  You OCD freak.  Oh, creepola.  I think a trade's in the works.  Yeah, we might be trading.  All right.  And I are not happy with our protectors.  We might be doing a switcheroo.  There are just certain aspects of things that are just a little odd. 
[00:18:00]  That's all.  Freaking Kenny, man.  We all have our crosses to bear.  Get up early one day.  I decide I'm going to take the garbage out, you know, so the mice don't show up while I'm gone.  Yeah.  And there's old creepola just staring at the buzzer.  It's like the middle of the night for everybody else, but he's just staring at the buzzer and his watch at the same time.  God forbid he pushes the buzzer at 4.59 instead of 5.  He will not push it at 4.59.  No.  That's discipline and dedication. 
[00:18:30]  It's creepy.  When you get caught, it's creepy.  Well, you got that.  This morning, I got this.  You know how I love driving into work, and I drive, I swear to you, it's now gotten up to about 90 miles an hour down the expressway.  Not many cars on the road.  When they're in the left lane, the middle lane's open.  I could weave around.  Are you trying to explain why you're going 90?  You just go 90.  I go 90.  You don't have to explain it.  It's 4.30 in the morning.  There's no one on the road. 
[00:19:00]  People go 90.  But when you're doing 90, you really got to stay focused.  I pay a lot of attention at what's going on everywhere around me, both hands on the wheel, and I'm really, like, I'm concentrating on driving.  And I get this this morning.  My cell phone starts ringing.  Anthony, I have no headlights.  Yeah, Paul.  Yeah, I'm driving. 
[00:19:30]  Yeah, my leather coat broke my headlight switch in my car, and I'm driving in with just my hazards on.  Hope I don't get pulled over.  Yeah, I hope I don't die in a fiery crash, because I'm doing 90, and now I'm talking on the phone.  I'm driving.  I'll see you later.  Well, you forgot to mention, too, that when your phone rings that early in the morning, you get panicky, because you think it might be the alarm company.  Right, right, because I just leave the house, and I'm thinking, all right, the house is being robbed or something, and they call the house first, and if they don't get a response, they call me. 
[00:20:00]  So I'm just thinking it's got to be something with the alarm, because who in their right mind would call me at this hour?  Who would call?  My lights don't work.  All right, Paul, I got to go.  I'm driving.  I'm really fast.  I can't drive with one hand.  So I'm like, boom, I'm back to 90 miles an hour again.  Five minutes later, now I'm like, holy Jesus Christ, this has to be now the alarm going off.  It's got to be.  It's got to be death and destruction at the house. 
[00:20:30]  Anthony, I'm here.  Just want to let you know I made it.  Thank you, Paul.  I might not.  I might be in a ditch on the side of the expressway because I'm talking on the phone doing 90.  Could you please not call me?  Right.  If I pull up and you're there, I will greet you, and it will be a wonderful thing.  If I pull up and you're not there, I'll wonder where you are, but I'll look around and be extra safe as I exit my vehicle.  Anthony might care for 15 seconds. 
[00:21:00]  But the thing is, the phone calls, the only phone call I ever ask for is if it's ever a quarter after five, I've asked Than to call me because that's like my fail-safe point.  If I'm still asleep in bed and a quarter after five rolls around and Than calls, I could still get up, get the hell out of the house, and make it here by showtime.  That's it.  That's the failed alarm call.  Other than that, I cannot be called. 
[00:21:30]  It freaks me out because I think my house is being robbed, and I'm doing 90.  I can't.  It's like calling Dale Earnhardt Jr. in the middle of the race.  Yeah, but he can handle it.  Don't do it.  He can handle it.  He's got a headset on.  He doesn't have to grab and open and look and press buttons.  I'm sure he goes no hands every once in a while because he's bored.  I wouldn't even mind calling the hands-free, but I don't give that number out. 
[00:22:00]  All right.  Hey, Bill in Waterford, we've got to take a break here.  How can an ex-cop be scared of blood and guts?  And then Jeremy the trucker from Fort Wayne, Indiana, bet you feel safe now.  Your security can be defeated with a bloody and creepy Halloween costume.  Did you see someone running up to you with a scream mask on?  Right.  Oh, I'm scared.  And he runs away like he saw a mouse.  And he just runs away as Opie gets pummeled by someone in a Halloween mask. 
[00:22:30]  He runs through the door like Herman Munster.  In the big dopey shape of Kenny.  Big hole in the door.  That dry hair.  All right, we've got to take a break.  We're just babbling.  We've got lots to do today.  We'd love to babble.  Oh, let's talk about Oprah when we get back, please.  Let's talk about the Halloween pedophiles getting a little knock on their door today,  making sure they're safe and sound inside their houses. 
[00:23:00]  Well, and I won't be home.  Got that special dish to give the candy out with a hole cut in it.  Everyone gets a lolly except one lucky fella gets a handful of memory repressors.  Dwayne Reed's sex toys, a big story here in New York.  Yes.  And they interviewed old women.  So, of course, they're appalled by what Dwayne Reed's doing.  We'll get into that as well and other things.  So, stay right there.  I think Danny's showing up in his Halloween costume soon?

It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  I see Danny wore his costume.  He showed up as an anti-climax.  What's that?  Nice.  He's saving it for tonight at the Hard Rock Cafe. 
[00:24:30]  He wants the big reveal at the party tonight.  I don't blame him.  He's sweet.  And then, you know, we're going to have videos and pictures up online starting sometime tomorrow.  Jimmy's awful hairdo is officially up on OpieandAnthony.com.  Contest on!  Let me see that first picture.  Jim's awful hairdo competition has begun.  Can you beat that hairdo?  That story looks like it could have been a lot worse than it was.  Oh, wow.  Is that a fuel tank truck that was hit by a train? 
[00:25:00]  Looked like the train stopped just in time.  Yeah, definitely, because it's just past the crossing.  Where'd that happen?  Knocked over the truck, though.  Yeah.  I don't know.  They'll hose it down.  They'll hose it down and move on with the traffic.  Let's get into some stuff, guys.  Oh, Oprah.  She's such a do-gooder.  Oh, Oprah.  Remember, what was that?  About a year ago or so? 
[00:25:30]  Maybe a little more than that.  And she gave away a car to every member of her audience.  You get a car and you get a car and you get a car.  And she let everybody out to the parking lot.  It was just full of cars for the audience.  And it became this big thing.  It was wonderful.  Yeah.  Well, then every talk show had to give the audience something.  Yeah.  And then now Oprah has to come up with some kind of giveaway every year now. 
[00:26:00]  Yep.  Did you hear what she gave away yesterday?  Yes, I did.  I'm stalling because I don't think this is going to play today for some reason.  This pompous, out-of-touch.  Say it, Ant.  Say it.  Presumptuous.  Oh, boy.  Goose.  Yes.  Silly goose. 
[00:26:30]  What's the matter there, Iraq?  He's got to brush it off.  Well, she had another giveaway.  All right, we got it.  And now I'm sure the audience members go in there thinking maybe Oprah's going to give away something today.  Maybe this will be the day I get mine.  I gets mines in the audience.  You know what these talk show audiences are made up of, right?  Fat housewives.  Fat housewives.  A lot of people, they fill in the gaps in the crowd with people that don't work. 
[00:27:00]  Some homeless are in there.  But for the most part, it's real lower to lower, barely middle class people that sit there and watch rubes.  We like to call them.  Sit and watch these talk shows.  It's not fun to go to.  They're not entertaining.  You're just hoping to get something out of it.  Are you kidding me?  A ticket for the Oprah show is a hot item.  Well, because you might get something.  Women want to fly from all over the country to go to a taping of Oprah. 
[00:27:30]  Because you might get something.  I think you're talking about the John McEnroe audience.  When we did the John McEnroe show, it was just like not doing the John McEnroe show because no one saw our appearance.  But that was all homeless.  That was unbelievable.  It was all like crackheads in the audience.  I don't know where they got the audience for that show.  Any talk show.  You're not going to get the – people are working.  They're doing things.  You're out of touch.  I'm sorry.  I am.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Because in my neighborhood, I live near the Regis thing. 
[00:28:00]  Yeah.  And the Starbucks is filled every morning with fat housewives from all over America.  They're taking a couple days off from their teaching.  From housewifing?  Or their teaching assistant job.  And they come to New York to go to one of these tapings.  Lower to middle class.  No.  I swear no.  I'll take pictures.  Out of your mind?  They're all dressed up.  They're all gussied up.  Put on a goddamn talk show.  They're all gussied up with their hairdos and their makeup. 
[00:28:30]  Yeah, because that's their biggest night out.  Their biggest day out of their life.  You know, some of the talk shows, sure, they fill the audience with losers.  But in general, no, I'm telling you.  They make a day of it.  They come from Long Island, Anthony.  To go to a taping of Regis or a taping of Tony Danza when he was on the air.  You know, look at Alan's audience.  They don't look well-to-do.  Let me tell you that much.  They don't look well-to-do.  You are wrong on this one. 
[00:29:00]  Maybe it's a mix of people because you get all Oprah and that attracts everything.  There are a lot of pantsuits and double-knits.  They're normal housewives.  Middle class, I'm telling you.  It's the shows that don't do well in the ratings that no one knows about that get the lower-class people.  That's the ones I'm watching.  Anyway, getting into the Oprah thing.  You want to just play the audio?  This was just terrific.  Of course.  Listen to this.  Okay, I want to know if everybody in this audience is up for a big challenge. 
[00:29:30]  Right there, the audience is like, oh, my God, here it is.  We're involved.  We heard the rumors.  We're involved.  We heard the rumors.  He's going to give us something.  We're getting something.  We're up for a challenge.  Wait.  Because here's the deal.  You know, over the years, I've given away cars and houses and my favorite things.  And I can honestly say that every gift I've ever given has brought at least as much happiness to me as it has to the person I've given it to. 
[00:30:00]  And that's the feeling I want to pass on to you.  I want you to have that feeling this season.  So here's what I've done.  Instead of going to a lot of companies, as I've done in the past, and asking them to sponsor my favorite things and give them to you,  I went to just one sponsor, Bank of America, and I asked them to help me do something that I've never done before.  Because I thought this was a very good idea.  They're all giddy.  Oh, my goodness.  Okay?  And I really do think that it's the best gift that I can give this audience.  So, thanks to our friends at Bank of America, they thought this was a good idea, too. 
[00:30:30]  Best gift.  Everyone here today is getting the chance to do something really extraordinary for others.  Okay?  Wow.  So, you will each go home with $1,000.  Now, this is screaming.  They don't understand yet.  Okay?  And that money, here's the challenge.  For that money, this is what you're going to do.  You're going to open your hearts.  You're going to be really creative. 
[00:31:00]  And you're going to spend it all at once on one stranger or spend a dollar on every person.  It doesn't matter to me.  There is so much you can do with this challenge.  You have to spend the money on somebody other than your family.  This rich, out-of-touch bitch.  You get nothing.  Good day, sir.  It makes her feel better when she buys gifts.  Yeah. 
[00:31:30]  Well, you're a billionaire.  Exactly.  You're a billionaire.  When she goes out and spends a grand on somebody, it's nothing to her.  And she's got a couple of billion dollars to fall back on.  The people in her audience get $1,000.  I'm sure they could use it to maybe supplement the rent, buy some groceries for the family.  You know, these are people that, it's kind of what I was getting at before.  They're not wealthy people.  They're not rich.  They could use that grand, believe me. 
[00:32:00]  And they thought they were getting it, and now they've got to give it away?  That's the, that's, is that a joke?  I would be like, Oprah, is that a joke?  Do you know what I would have to do?  This is really, perhaps politically incorrect.  But just to teach her a lesson, I would have to donate it to the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan.  Just, just to show her that this is not the way you, you, you, you show people how rich you are. 
[00:32:30]  Or just turn to your right and give, and give your, you think everybody just does that?  Just turn to your right.  And go.  And you grab the other person to your left, and you're, you'll leave.  There you go.  I gave away mine.  I gave away mine, and I get $1,000 from the stranger to my left.  You're a pompous bitch.  That audience was so whipped up into a frenzy that they thought they were getting something.  I mean, if it was an audience filled with millionaires, I can understand.  But you're right.  It's middle class. 
[00:33:00]  These are people that need it.  You think lower middle class.  Yeah, they could pay a bill.  They could use $1,000.  They thought they were getting it, and then they're told that it's going to feel good.  You know what?  It feels good to help when you don't have to worry where your bills are being paid, and you know money is coming in.  It feels great to help.  Especially with Christmas coming.  Right.  Maybe I have a few little tots at home who you want to buy gifts for, but you can't, so you're going to have to smother them.  You know, you joke, Jimmy. 
[00:33:30]  I hope.  But it's true.  The holidays are here.  They're probably, how many members of that audience were thinking, oh, my kid's been talking about this the whole year.  I really would like to get her this, or him this gift, but I can't afford it.  And then Oprah.  Oh, man, she comes through with $1,000.  Yeah.  Oh, wait.  I got to what?  I got to do what?  I got to give it away?  I would make sure it goes to every organization that personally offends Oprah Winfrey. 
[00:34:00]  That's what I would do.  Well, it gets better.  Listen to this.  Does it?  Imagine the love and the kindness that you could spread with $1,000.  And to document your good deeds, because I want to make sure you document your good deeds, we are lending everybody in this audience our favorite Sony DVD handkerchief.  Okay, did you catch that?  They're lending.  They're lending.  How about you give Oprah?  You're a billionaire.  See, this is the bit.  You give the $1,000, they have to give it away to people. 
[00:34:30]  Then they document it on their brand new freaking camcorder that they get to keep.  Then it makes sense for everybody.  And that's a good bid.  The viewer gets something nice, and then they document them giving away the $1,000 to a worthy cause.  Can you believe that?  That's a good compromise, anyway.  I would break the camera.  The only thing that would make me not want to smack her fat face would be if, at the end of the whole thing, she did wind up giving each of the audience members something that was really nice that she didn't announce. 
[00:35:00]  Well, I certainly don't think she did.  No, because it would have made the paper.  I mean, no, because it's going to be, after this is done, because it's going to be shot.  She's going to be using this for an episode.  Oh, so you think all the people are going to be able to shoot something good?  The ones that did what she said?  The ones that did something good.  So there's going to be maybe five people out of the, however many are in her audience?  No, they all have to spend it.  Yeah, I know, but most people aren't good at taking, they aren't good at building a store. 
[00:35:30]  Most people are idiots.  Do you think they're going to be able to take that camcorder and make a dramatic type of presentation of money to something that's worthwhile and looks good on camera and does a good job?  There's going to be five people that come back with anything worth using.  Look at our stupid contest when we ask the listeners to send in audio.  We get five things that are half-assed and the rest is crap.  That's what she's going to get.  I can't wait until one fat do-gooder shows up to some homeless guy and says, 
[00:36:00]  Hi, I was on the Oprah Winfrey Show and I have a little something.  And you just hear him go, and all you hear is, urgh, and you see a fist come right towards that camera.  And then she loses the camera and the thousand dollars.  You hear the piano music as she's in the hospital.  And some other person that was in the audience is filming her.  Right, right.  Somewhere over the rainbow.  So, Hawaiian style.  Right.  And they give the thousand dollars to her family to have her face reconstructed and her teeth put back in.  All right, so maybe there's a twist in the end. 
[00:36:30]  Maybe Oprah brings back all these people and then, because they did the right thing and they were all do-gooders, then they get an award.  Right.  Because it is America.  We have to be awarded for our good teeth.  People are saying here that Oprah didn't even pay for this.  No.  Banks of America.  Sure.  All right, more on the camcorders.  Everybody in this audience, our favorite Sony DVD handkerchief.  How's it true?  Okay.  Yay, I got to give it back.  Okay.  And here's the deal.  We're going to give you one week to come up with your plan and to shoot your own story. 
[00:37:00]  So, you're going to shoot your own story.  Tell us how you spent the money.  Shoot the people you gave the money to.  So, are you up for the joy?  Shoot them.  Literally.  Literally.  We're all like some people with some great suggestions.  What?  Like what?  What?  Like what?  I don't know.  Are they a real suggestion?  One or two?  Those seem like similar ideas, but are pretty good. 
[00:37:30]  Put them one.  Max in L.A.  What's up, boys?  What's up, Max?  Hey, I'll tell you what.  I believe I'd take that $1,000 and then make a porn video.  So, you take the grand.  You hire yourself a hooker.  You hire yourself a hooker.  You're giving her.  Hey, she needs the money.  The hooker needs the money.  That's why she's doing it.  So, you're helping someone.  And then you use the camera to videotape yourself doing the hooker.  Yeah.  And then you come back to Oprah and go, here's how I spent my money.  Can you imagine her staff in a big conference room looking at the videos? 
[00:38:00]  As you're talking to Oprah into the camera, as you're just doing it like.  Right.  You and your friends are giving bukkake to some girl who has three starving kids and needs  drug money.  You're making your version of tub girl.  What?  What?  I thought this would be good.  Yeah.  This is...  I'm helping.  How many of those cameras do you think are going to end up in pawn shops?  Yeah.  What happened to the camera?  I lost it, Oprah. 
[00:38:30]  Oprah, I lost my camera, Oprah.  I'm sure they got to sign all sorts of crap to take the camera with them.  Well, John in Queens, I think Max beat you to it, but you got anything else to add to  it?  Nothing really.  All right, John.  Great job.  Yeah, he's saying the hooker.  Yeah, yeah.  Not a good hooker.  Let's see.  Oh, okay.  Pete on Long Island.  Pete. 
[00:39:00]  Pete?  Pete.  We lost him?  Pete?  Hold on a minute.  Let's try this again.  Hello?  Hey, Pete.  What's up?  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hey.  I think you'll find yourself some crackhead homeless guy.  Smells like piss.  Give him $1,000.  Let him jump up and down.  Shut up the camera.  Knock him over the head.  Throw him in a dumpster.  Take it back.  American Psycho style.  You know what I'm saying?  I kind of like the idea.  I like the violence, but yeah.  The idea of handing it to someone and turning the camera off and bludgeoning them and just  taking it back.  There is something kind of cute about that. 
[00:39:30]  Oh, I'm sorry.  So it looks all nice on camera.  You get the $1,000 back, and you get to bludgeon someone on camera.  Oh, well, you got to turn the camera off.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I would film another cake stomping video.  Oh, treat yourselves.  Oh, no.  I earned that cake.  Hey, I have an idea what we could give Andrew, by the way, if we see him.  Yeah.  We take a $100 bill.  Yeah.  And we cut it in half. 
[00:40:00]  And then you let him see that half of that $100.  And he gets all excited.  And when he takes it, he realizes it's worth nothing.  It's just half.  And then we laugh and walk away.  Oh, showing him the other half as we walk away.  Yeah.  One of us eats it.  That's a good one.  We haven't seen him since the cake stomping.  Poor guy.  We'll see him, I'm sure, any day now.  Tom in Boston, what's up?  You can tell her audience is white, middle-class women, because if she had said that to, like,  200 black women, there would have been a riot. 
[00:40:30]  It just hangs up.  Do we have time to do the Tyra audio?  It kind of goes with what we're talking about.  Does it?  Well, Tyra is the Oprah knockoff.  She's pretty much trying to do the Oprah thing.  Yeah.  The young version of Oprah.  The Oprah satellite.  And she also did a giveaway on her show.  Did she?  Yeah, you know, just, like, giving away the $1,000 or giving away the car, giving away  this, the houses, all that crap. 
[00:41:00]  Tyra, she's right there with Oprah.  Yeah.  You want to hear what she gave away on her show?  Please.  I'm about to reveal my biggest beauty secret ever!  Yes!  Yes!  Yes!  Hey, everybody.  It's my I and anything cream, meaning I and anything.  All right?  And during the break, we had some really hunky boys that brought out these very special boxes  to our studio audience.  And inside the boxes is my super-duper, no-fell, skin-saving eye and anything cream! 
[00:41:30]  Yeah!  She even tries to sound like Oprah.  Yeah!  Cream!  I wonder how, I wonder what Oprah, uh, how she feels about Tyra pretty much doing her act.  Hoo-hoo!  She has to feel like, uh, I wish I looked like her.  Well, probably.  How does Tyra have a show?  She's not very good.  She's god-horrid.  She is horrid.  Ugh.  Oh, I don't know. 
[00:42:00]  Well, so, she can't...  She's awful at the job of running a talk show, because she's got no, um, personality, pizzazz,  charisma, nothing.  She tries.  Bye, Skyrim!  Bye, blah, blah, blah!  Well, she, uh, yeah, well.  But she makes it about herself, so.  Yeah.  Everything has to be about her.  So, the audience all has these, have these really nice boxes in front of them, and they're  about to open them up, to see what Tyra's giving them. 
[00:42:30]  Yeah.  Anything, I am anything, Kray!  Yes!  Yes!  So, on the count of three, I want you to all open them together.  Are you ready?  Yes!  Drum roll, please!  One!  Two!  What comes after two?  Three!  Open them!  Open them!  Open them!  Open them!  Open them!  Go!  Keep them going!  Oh, y'all!  It's my favorite! 
[00:43:00]  Keep them going!  Keep them going!  You'll get back to leave!  And you'll get back to leave!  And you'll get back to leave!  And you'll get back to leave!  Oh!  Yes!  Yes!  You'll get back to leave!  You'll get back to leave!  You'll get back to leave!  You'll get back to leave!  You'll get back to leave!  And you'll get back to leave!  Okay, I don't. 
[00:43:30]  It's a little joke.  Yeah, she gave away our Nelson Vaseline.  She gave away Vaseline.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Does anybody remember last year? 
[00:44:00]  Boring.  Yeah, well.  Look at it.  Yeah.  Shame.  Shame.  Shame.  Shame.  Shame.  Ah.  Yeah, well.  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring.  Banana phone.  She gave away Vaseline.  She should be spitting into Sandy Duncan's water.  Vaseline.  That's what she did. 
[00:44:30]  And she continued to scream.  I love it.  I use it morning, noon, and night, you guys.  Your wildest dreams have come true.  Yeah, well, there you go.  Damn rich horse.  Oh, hey, hey, hey, whoa, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. 
[00:45:00]  There's people.  Whoa, hey.  So.  It would have been great.  It would have been great if she was mocking Oprah Winfrey with the free Vaseline, but she  wasn't.  She wasn't.  It would have been a great goof.  No, she's giving away Vaseline.  Vaseline.  Very excited about it.  I mean, to be honest, I would probably be legitimately happy if I got that.  Yeah?  Yeah, for other reasons.  Well, if it was applied to her, perhaps, in the proper fashion.  Yeah, I wouldn't put it around your eyes, but if I used it right, believe me, your eyes  would get hit.  Maybe one eye. 
[00:45:30]  Special one.  They're all dancing around in the audience.  Well, the video's.  Not the blue ones.  The video's up on YouTube if you want to check it out.  It's creepy.  Matt in New York, what's up?  Not much, man.  What's going on?  Hey.  That was just so creepy, it wasn't even funny.  Yeah, well.  We got plenty of Tyra clips.  We could spend a whole day talking about Tyra.  It really was, like, douche chill inducing.  Yeah.  It was just, like, the way she says it, how many times, the excitement factor. 
[00:46:00]  Vaseline!  Vaseline!  Vaseline!  Everybody's getting Vaseline!  Oh, I want to punch her in the mouth.  The level at which she stinks is almost mind-boggling.  Hey, man.  Her ratings are great.  She's got, like, two shows on TV.  Her ratings are great!  She's blown up, and I just don't get it.  I wish she would literally blow up. 
[00:46:30]  On any level.  Yeah, well, people like that.  I mean, people like crap.  I mean, obviously, this show's a perfect example.  She's rolling on the floor during that, by the way.  I'm looking at the video clip.  Yes, there.  She is on the floor, rolling around, jumping with her audience.  She falls on the floor.  Well.  Oh, what a mess.  I would stomp her as she was on the floor, just kind of, excuse me, pardon me, pardon me,  get out of your seat.  Pardon me, excuse me.  Bam!  Bam!  I would put a ball in her mouth, and then start singing.  I'm singing in the rain, and I give her a good kick in the belly. 
[00:47:00]  Me, Dim, and George would have our go.  Call me Dim no more.  Our Tyra audio's piling up, too, by the way.  She did a show on obese teenagers that is hilarious.  She does some horrible acting on America's Next Top Model.  We got that audio.  Mine call R. Nelson.  Oh, sorry.  Jimmy, you're an actor.  Maybe we could play this and, you know, and see what you think.  I certainly am.  And then Tyra offers Top Model contestants guidance for her show, you know, America's Next Top Model. 
[00:47:30]  And the whole thing was she was trying to make these people cry to make good TV.  Because that makes good TV.  She is just the worst.  I have advice for models.  Here's what you do.  Finger down throat, repeat.  Fat horse.  Let's go to Terry in Vegas.  Terry.  Hey, guys, I love you.  I hate to disagree, but I really think that Tyra was mocking Oprah.  I don't know.  You got to see the video on YouTube.  She's too...  Listen to what she says.  She goes, you get fast leading, you get fast leading, you get fast leading, kind of like, you get a car and you get... 
[00:48:00]  Yeah, yeah, I know that whole thing was done.  But even when people on talk shows started giving away things after Oprah did that, legitimate things, they would say that, like, to be like Oprah.  But they were really giving away something.  Terry, I don't know.  Well, I wish you were right, but I don't think she's smart enough.  That's the problem.  And it's so far after it happened.  It's so, like, long ago already.  Why joke about something that happened a year ago? 
[00:48:30]  Yeah.  Did she do this the same day that Oprah gave away the $1,000?  No, no.  I think this hit before Oprah, even.  I'm telling you, man.  She's not smart enough.  And she's so pompous that she thinks people are there to just listen to whatever she has to say.  Well, I just think just the fact that she even tried to sound like Oprah or did the whole Oprah voice.  But she does that all the time.  She does it on every show.  Go ahead.  You go ahead.  Go ahead.  She's doing it.  I'm sorry.  I like how the guy's doing the bit.  Yeah, she's doing it.  Just do it.  You guys. 
[00:49:00]  Go ahead.  She's doing Oprah every day on TV.  All right.  Thank you, Terry.  All right.  See you.  Yeah, whatever.  Some people are saying that she's spoofing Oprah.  I don't know.  I really don't know.  You look at the video.  You can't really tell.  You can't tell.  All right.  It's the only virus spreading across America.  We've got to take a break.  We'll continue with something next.  I can walk on my hands.  I can fart and chew gum.  I play the over.  I can ride a unicycle.  I wear a bra and laced panties.  So your talent is being queer, Travis?

[00:50:30]  Jimmy, we got the blog of this girl.  I'm out of this bit.  I don't really know what's going on.  I know we did the Fatty Pig Fatty Contest, and we got it.  Today's the day we announced the winner.  It looks like it's going to be Honey from Binghamton at 505 pounds.  Someone beats at the planet.  With hx.com coming in to present check.  Probably to us.  Some people love that.  Yeah.  This one blog.  And it's amazing the language that's used by her.  Oh, I love it.  Describing her own, you know, just morbid obesity.  The whole title. 
[00:51:00]  Just say no.  That's what it's titled.  Just say no.  Isn't that ironic?  She's going to make a difference with this.  Well, just the fact.  Yeah, just say no to french fries.  Yeah.  Exactly.  How about you say no, you monster?  This glutton who can't say no.  I got a disease.  I got a disease.  Ah.  Ah, here it goes.  Today, one of the postings on the Yahoo group, Don't Tell Me What Size I Must Be.  Is there a Yahoo group called Don't Tell Me What Size I Must Be? 
[00:51:30]  It's just what apparently it is.  It's a bunch of fatos looking to empower themselves by saying things like, hey, I can be however  I want, which legally you can be, and fine.  But don't get mad when you have to pay for two airline tickets.  And don't make a face when people get disgusted when they have to be shoved over next to you  because you've taken up the room of two real human beings.  When I was on a plane and there was this fat Israeli girl next to me in the middle seat 
[00:52:00]  and her gut was hanging over on, I wanted to bite her.  It was a Los Angeles flight.  Of course you did.  I wanted to bite her because her side fat was coming over.  It's just flowing like liquid.  They're like skin-covered mercury.  They just infringe on every little part of you.  Yeah, Don't Tell Me What Size I Must Be was the news group.  It was about a contest being held by the Opie and Anthony show called Fatty Pig Fatty. 
[00:52:30]  I love seeing that in writing.  I know.  Perfect.  Especially with Fat Girl.  Yeah.  The posting was by Velvet, who happens to be the very same Velvet,  who was the plus-size model recently featured to much fanfare and flack  in the Gaultier fashion show.  Fanfare and flack?  I don't know.  The gist of the contest is for fat women. 
[00:53:00]  Please note, contest is not open to men.  That's right.  That's right.  Yeah.  It's funny.  You don't mind a lot of other things.  You don't mind girls in college being not open to...  What am I talking about?  Shut up.  Yeah, Jimmy, just...  I have it in his mouth.  I could not pull the string.  That thought got lost on the way from your head to your mouth.  Ed Norton.  Hit reverse and get that car back in the garage.  Put a blathering mush mouth.  All right, go ahead.  Not open to men. 
[00:53:30]  To go on the Opie and Anthony show in the studio,  put on a...  and weigh in.  At the end of the contest,  the heaviest entrant will win $10 for every pound she weighs.  There's also a fatty finder's fee.  If the woman is brought in by a friend,  i.e. pimp fee.  She calls it a pimp fee.  Well, yeah.  Velvet called this contest, and I quote Velvet, 
[00:54:00]  despicable in every sense of the word.  Why don't you say despicable?  Who thinks that you mean despicable kind of?  In every sense of the word.  How many senses of the word despicable are there?  Wait, is Velvet a famous fatty?  We got a famous fatty that is pissed off by our contest?  Perhaps.  She's been in a Gossier fashion show.  She's a member of a group called Don't Tell Me What Size I Must Be.  Right.  And it's basically women who look like neutron stars  trying to justify why they can't stop shoving comfort food. 
[00:54:30]  Obviously, we are telling you what size you should be  because they're trying to get rid of trans fats and getting healthier oils.  Yeah.  Of course.  In our fast food.  I can't control myself, so I will be a burden to society.  Absolutely.  Don't tell me what size.  I must be fine.  And don't tell us we can't attack you and use you for lamp oil.  And can you hold on for one second?  We got a faithful listener.  Oh, my God.  Needs our help. 
[00:55:00]  Marge from the little shelter out there on Long Island  taking care of the doggies and the kitties.  What can we do for you today, Marge?  Marge, hi.  Good morning, gentlemen.  Happy Halloween, Marge.  Hi, Marge.  Happy Halloween to you.  Are you in yours?  Are you dressing up all the dogs and cats in little Halloween costumes  before you march them to the oven?  Well, actually, it's a very...  Why don't you dress them up as fertilizer?  It's a very...  Frowl, Marge.  Right.  Oh, thank you, darling.  I have a very, very sad story to tell you.  Oh, no.  And before you... 
[00:55:30]  Wait, let me get the right sound templates.  What is the sad story?  What's the sad story?  What's the doctor in good health?  We have an 11-year-old little doggie that was found wandering on the street.  Yeah.  And we called him Bob Hope.  Bob Hope.  Wait, why would you call him Bob Hope?  Well, we called him that after we found out what happened.  Oh, wait, what happened?  Well, Bob, what happened?  And now that you got Bob Hope, you might as well change the name to Bob No Hope.  It's the oven for you, little doggie.  Did you call him that because he was hit by a car and it was just on the road? 
[00:56:00]  Not to anywhere, just on the road.  Let's challenge ourselves.  How many Bob Hope jokes can we come up with in five minutes?  All right, Marge.  I'm sorry.  Continue.  Marge, you're not dealing with the whole conversation thing.  You just kind of barrel ahead.  Yeah.  Continue, Marge.  All right.  You found Bob Hope wandering around on the road.  No, he's dead.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah.  And then we brought him back to the shelter and he was very depressed.  We found out that he has rectal cancer. 
[00:56:30]  Marge, you've got to be kidding me.  There's a dog at your shelter with rectal cancer.  You should change his name from...  Wait.  Wait, Marge.  You've got to calm down.  Marge, you should change his name from Bob Hope to Michael Landon.  When we named him Bob, it was before we found out what we did.  So here's the rest of the story.  We brought...  If he had the personality of rectal cancer, you could call him Bob Eatman.  We brought him into the shelter and... 
[00:57:00]  Oh, please.  Okay, go ahead.  Okay.  He was so depressed, he wouldn't eat.  He was just laying around so lethargic.  So one of the...  No kibbles like coming out.  ...from little shelter brought him home.  The cancer of the rectum.  And now here is the medical miracle.  Oh, okay.  Here it comes.  Okay.  After the woman brought the dog home, he started to eat.  He's sleeping with the other dogs in the household.  He barks. 
[00:57:30]  He picked up.  He's like a different dog.  That's good.  And it goes...  And that's when we named him Bob Hope.  Does he do that thing where he gets on his...  No, he does.  He sits down and drags himself across the carpet and leaves like hamburger meat.  It's called scooting.  Healthy dogs do.  Oh, healthy dogs do that?  Yeah.  Let's feed him stuff that's tough to digest.  But poor Bob...  Hey, mush up some glass and put it in more food.  Oh, good God.  Poor Bob.  Now, how do you treat a dog with rectal cancer?  That's why I'm calling.  Okay.  We have huge medical bills ahead of us. 
[00:58:00]  We're going to try the...  That's why we call them Bob Hope.  Yeah.  Because now we have hope that this little dog...  It's going to end up just like Bob Hope.  I know how you care it.  It's called driveway and reverse...  This fellow could live another year or so.  A year?  And how much will that year cost?  It's supposed to prove...  Oh, God.  Thousands of dollars.  Is it worth the life of a dog?  Thousands of dollars.  Can we perhaps maybe give that thousands of dollars to maybe a child that can use it? 
[00:58:30]  You know, there's...  I've been asked this question...  Okay.  Fair enough.  There are people that...  We need people in the animal business that care enough about animals to want to help them.  There are people...  Oh, Rink.  Yeah.  Come on, guys.  Every charity has their own...  All right.  Why do you got cooking in your oven over here?  Here we have an organization.  Yeah.  I'm not going to go into this thing.  Good luck to Bob Hope. 
[00:59:00]  No, no, no, no.  We got to get back to the...  So, Bob Hope needs money.  Bob Hope needs...  All right.  Little shelter right there on Warner Road.  Oh, God bless you.  In East North Port of...  Do you want to come to Thanksgiving, gentlemen?  Shut up.  Only if you're serving that dumb cancer dog.  You will have the best time at my daughter's house with her.  I bring nothing to the table.  You don't bring anything.  You just bring yourselves.  Yes or no?  Are you with me or again?  Can we play dog football?  We'll...  Listen.  Jesus.  If you come to our house for Thanksgiving... 
[00:59:30]  A little depressed coughing dog with a bandana on.  What a buzzkill.  You're trying to scratch his little chin.  Oh, coughing.  All right.  Sorry.  Getting back to...  Where are we in this...  We were talking about Fatty Pig Fatty.  Yeah.  And there's a blog that this fat girl has...  And she doesn't like the contest very much.  Okay.  Velvet, who is this plus-size model, posted on this, and she called it despicable in every  sense of the word, the contest. 
[01:00:00]  I agree, says...  Do we have a name for her yet?  I don't think so.  The blogger?  Yeah.  Sue Ann.  Oh, Sue Ann.  Okay, Sue Ann.  Sue Ann, she says, I agree.  But what I find even more despicable...  Is there something more than that, Ed?  And she says, imagine that being said by Sylvester the cat.  Does anybody remember laughing?  Wait, I'm trying to think what else Sylvester could say.  But Fat C, he can say without... 
[01:00:30]  Without slashing.  No.  What she finds even more despicable is that women are actually showing up for this contest.  That's right.  Because they have a sense of humor.  Uh, they need the money.  Oh, yeah.  There are two hard truths at work here.  There will always be morons like Opie and Anthony.  Can't be helped.  The stupid and ignorant will always be with us.  And there will always be people who will do anything for money. 
[01:01:00]  Case in point, fear factor.  You should say there's three points.  Uh, there's always going to be morons, people who will do anything for money, and I'm a fat  pig with no power.  Point three.  People, and I use that term loosely, like Opie and Anthony.  And unlike her own pants, which have not been loose since she was in the fourth grade.  Right.  Uh, you're arm fat, and I use the term loosely.  You pig people.  At least we're shaped like humans.  You fat, go to Jupiter where you fit in. 
[01:01:30]  You slob.  You're a slovenly slob woman.  People.  And I use the term loosely, like Opie and Anthony.  We are people.  We're people who actually have the nerve and the, uh, the, the guts to speak honestly about  monsters like yourself.  You're a freak of nature.  A monster.  You walk this earth being looked at like a monster.  The freak that you are, you fat slob. 
[01:02:00]  You slob.  Ugh.  Magic that being said by so much.  Human, she uses the term loosely.  We have a forum, Opie.  Yeah.  And Jimmy, of course, because people give them one.  If people boycotted their show and didn't encourage their immature and hurtful antics, maybe it  would stop.  How about you boycott food, you freak?  How about doing that?  Instead of, uh, dedicating all this energy to boycotting us, how about you eliminate, uh, 
[01:02:30]  fat people, and that way we couldn't have a contest like this?  How about you eliminate carbs?  You shut your mouth for a second and stop shoving food in there, and then perhaps we couldn't  do this contest, and we'd have to concentrate on the anorexics, like we want to on our next  contest.  Wait, I forget what I had a name for, too.  Oh, no.  So Sue Ann's go away, and Heather's, uh, here you come on board for our, uh, bulimic and 
[01:03:00]  anorexia contest.  The puke you silly goose contest.  We are thinking of doing it.  All right, where are we?  Okay, uh, but instead their moronic behavior is revered and celebrated.  It's a simple fact.  Ignore the class bully, and he will stop.  Fear or applaud him, and he will continue.  She raises a good point.  She raises her weight.  That's all she raises.  Slob.  It's also known fact that a very large woman are often at the, at near the bottom of the 
[01:03:30]  economic chain.  Well, it's a weight issue.  Yeah.  If they were on top, the economic chain would be crushed.  Here's, yeah.  Here's, um, here's why, fatty.  Because people don't want to hire, for the most part, fat women.  Fat women's job options are less than thin women.  Because bosses don't like having fat women around the places they work.  They want hot pieces of ass because they think they might bang them eventually. 
[01:04:00]  They want cuter women because either they bring in more business, or like Opie said, maybe  there's an opportunity to bang them and then add it to fatties.  Uh, they know that maybe their lunch breaks aren't going to last two hours.  There's plenty of reasons to hire a skinny girl.  They're looking for eye candy.  Yeah, you want to pinch someone's ass as they walk by.  That's what a secretary is when she walks by.  You take your, your pointer finger and your thumb, and you go, pinch!  You pinch!  You pinch and maybe go, while you're doing it.  Pinch!  And then if she turns around and looks, you wink. 
[01:04:30]  That's right.  And then she goes and gets you that cup of coffee.  Light and sweet, honey.  That's how I take it.  Her arm, when you pinch her fanny, her arm should be splayed out, and her leg should kick  up behind her in the tee-hee move.  Tee-hee!  What is known as the tee-hee move.  Yeah.  Uh, yeah, you're at the bottom of the economic chain because, uh, it's harder to get, uh,  high-paying jobs if you're fat, if you lose weight, you'd get some, and 50% of your income,  perhaps more, goes to food.  And you're always late because you get such bad gas mileage. 
[01:05:00]  Right.  In your car.  They're getting the gas mileage of a tank.  And bad gas, too.  This easy money would be tempting for anyone, I admit.  The first thing I did was calculate how much money I would win, and that's none of your  beeswax.  Ugh.  That's what she says.  I think she has to go somewhere where there's honey nearby.  Right.  See, even she was tempted by this contest.  Yeah, even she did the math in her big fat head.  And who hasn't done the math as you walk around town?  But for every supersized woman who showed up for this despicable contest, there are thousands 
[01:05:30]  who didn't.  But supersized, and here the shoes, very large.  Yeah.  How about just an honest language?  Fat.  You're fat.  It's not even, I'm not even saying that now to be angry or hurtful.  You are fat.  So don't try to soften what you're saying.  Super-sized women?  What does that mean?  What does it even mean?  It means fat.  Thousands of plus-size women, plus-size women, just trying to make their lives work in this 
[01:06:00]  crazy world just like everyone else.  No, not just like everyone else.  Like, like a monster.  You're a monster.  Go out tonight on Halloween.  Don't wear anything but what you wear every day.  That's right.  There, you're in costume as a beast.  An eating machine.  It's a blue whale.  No, she doesn't have a costume on.  And women like Velvet strutting their stuff with glamour and pride. 
[01:06:30]  No.  People look at fat women that come out on the runway with glamour and pride as freaks.  You look and go, where are the skinny models?  You look at them, it's like a freak show.  It's a gag.  It's a goof.  Your first thought is, man, if she lost 50 pounds, she would really look good.  That's your first thought always.  Like the girl in our TV commercial.  Right.  She's beautiful.  She's very pretty.  But the first thing I thought was, man, if she lost 50 pounds, man.  And let me tell you. 
[01:07:00]  This girl would be a knockout.  That girl's overweight.  But she's well-kempt.  She's pretty.  She takes care of herself.  99% of these fatties can't even do that.  They stink because they can't wash their fat.  They don't take care of themselves because they've given up.  That's what we're talking about, monster.  And women like Velvet's strutting their stuff with glamour and pride.  These are the women I applaud. 
[01:07:30]  Can you applaud?  Can you touch your hands in front of your body?  She has to slap each hand on her leg.  Yeah, on that thigh.  My advice to all women tempted to enter the Opie and Anthony contest, just say no.  Just say no.  My advice to all who want to follow the contest and or this despicable show, just say no.  Trust me.  The world would be a better place.  No, it wouldn't.  You know, the world would be a better place without the likes of you. 
[01:08:00]  She just says no a lot except when it counts for her own cholesterol.  When it comes to dessert menu?  How about just say no?  That's right.  Hey, you want that big frappuccino?  How about you just say no to that?  What's her name?  Sue Ann.  Sue Ann.  Sue Ann.  A fat girl name.  A big fat girl name.  We got Kelly from Syracuse on the line.  Kelly.  Hey, I really think that this whole contest is horrible.  And if you guys didn't have any heart at all, any soul, that you guys would feel for these fat chicks a little bit. 
[01:08:30]  Why feel for a monster that is bashing our contest and our show?  You mean the ones that come in?  It might not be their fault.  There could be a thyroid.  Bull crap.  I've heard that.  I'll give 1% the benefit of the doubt.  1% of those fatties the benefit of the doubt for some kind of medical reason.  The rest of them are big pig face stuffing monsters with no self control that want us to cater to them. 
[01:09:00]  I'm not going to be an enabler for a pig.  We all know fat people in our own lives.  And if you just take just a moment to look at what they're eating, you're like, oh, come on.  I mean, you can help yourself a bit.  This is why they're fat.  You can help yourself a bit here.  How many faulty thyroids are out there, Kelly?  Kelly, how fat are you?  Are you a big girl?  Ramone, give me a Twinkie.  I love Kelly from Syracuse.  That could be the first female Ramone.  To go Ramone.  I love the way that sounded. 
[01:09:30]  Ramona.  Do you know?  Ramona.  Yeah.  Morgan Spurlock raised a brilliant point at the end of Super Size Me, which was about when you see a fat person eating a certain thing.  Fat person.  It's like when you see a guy smoking, people are always like, you got to quit.  He's like, why don't we take this approach to people who are eating horribly?  Yeah.  And look, maybe it doesn't affect like there's no secondhand food.  But the bottom line is insurance, man, my insurance still goes up because people paying for your surgery and all the health issues that you have because of your overeating. 
[01:10:00]  So it's like, why shouldn't we criticize that?  And let me ask you another thing.  Were we looking for girls to come in here that were 5'6", 160?  No.  No.  No.  The fat.  We're looking for monsters.  And every monster that came in had a good time.  Earthshaking.  Except for Honey, she sort of had a good time.  You know what?  The rest of them were great sports for this guy.  You know what we're looking for?  I don't want a girl to come in here unless when she's walking into the studio, I see my water ripple in the glass right next to me. 
[01:10:30]  I want to see the water go.  I want to see a goat disappear.  Monsters is what we were looking for, you idiot.  Not pleasantly plump.  Not slightly overweight girls.  Not girls that can walk down the street without spinning heads around going, holy crap, how does she even live?  And the point you brought up, or was it Jimmy, about the cigarette smoking?  Me?  Yeah.  I brought that up.  I took it from Morgan Spurl.  And it's true.  I thought I had a point. 
[01:11:00]  People that are smoking, drinking too much, family members will always come up to them and say, what are you doing?  You've got to stop.  Please.  You're killing yourself.  Stop smoking.  But what about the fat person?  When you just seem loaded.  You ever see a fat person when they open that mouth and shove a big creamy thing in there?  I can't help it.  You just want to smack them.  Please.  I got to disease my ass.  Just stop it.  Our own Steve C. is a good example.  That guy was a slob.  But he was a, Steve was a fat dude, but Steve got surgery, and now he's in the gym all the time. 
[01:11:30]  He's obsessed.  But you know what?  Steve, like, added 20 years to his life or whatever.  Oh, knock it off and gain some weight back, you obsessive freak.  That is true.  20 more years of unnavigatable web work.  But, like, Steve looks really good, man.  Would you make a choice?  I will eat something every time I'm able to navigate my website.  Exactly.  And the pounds peeled away.  100 music diet. 
[01:12:00]  But you're in the gym all the time.  You work out, man.  You watch what you eat, and you're, like, sticking by the rest, you know?  Yeah, completely.  Completely.  And it's just, you know, the self-esteem boost.  You knew what you had to do.  Yeah.  I mean, but you have to get to that point yourself.  You know, it's very obvious.  You're born with a body type.  Like, I could never be as big as Steve.  No.  When you're born with a body type, then it's up to you to decide.  Do you want to be on the heavy side of that body type or on the, you know, on the lighter  side of that body type?  And no one's talking about people with a gut or people who are overweight. 
[01:12:30]  No.  You're talking about people who are so fat that it inconveniences other people when you're  close to the, like, that's it.  That's it.  That's it.  If your personal life is you want to just eat and be 20 pounds, go ahead.  Who cares?  Yeah.  Or stay home all the time.  Right.  Why are we turning this into a serious conversation?  I want to...  Because this bitch wrote this blog.  No, I want to...  But then people commented and the ONA pest got involved.  They were very serious comments by the pest.  Yes, that's what I want to get into here.  Of course.  And we're late.  Should we take a break, then do...  And then...  Yeah, we better do that, because we're really late.  Yeah, I'm starving. 
[01:13:00]  Got any crump cake?  When we get back...  Got any crump cake back there.  Get me some celery, Kenneth.  The ONA pest had comments to the Just Say No post, and they're just terrific.  Responsible pest post.  There's a lot of...  Very helpful.  I'm Paul R. Nelson, and I approve of this posting.  Yeah, how did Paul R. Nelson post so much?  We'll read some of these.  They're hilarious.  We'll do that when we get back.  Also, we got to talk about the Dwayne Reed sex toys.  We got to talk about the pedophiles being checked up on. 
[01:13:30]  Corralled up for Halloween.  Yeah, they got a curfew that I think starts right now.  Pet them inside.  They got a curfew that starts right now.  Because then the kids can come right to your home where you are.  Yeah.  The curfew should be...  You should have to be outside.  No, you're not going to molest a kid in the middle of the street.  Yeah, you should be in the middle of the street.  And then they come all line up.  And then a hilarious story about a teen raping his own mom.  We'll get into that in just a bit.  It's the O.A. virus spreading across America.  Jim Norton will be appearing on The Late Show with David Letterman. 
[01:14:00]  Wednesday, November 1st.  Check local listings for showtimes.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony.  Right back into the show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Spreading across America on this fine Halloween.  Oh, yeah.  The Opie and Anthony Halloween Show is brought to you by Saw 3.  If it's Halloween, it must be Saw in theaters everywhere as we speak.  It's going to be a great time at the Hard Rock Cafe tonight.  If you're coming to the show and you're thinking about wearing a costume, we're looking for costumes that have something to do with the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:14:30]  Use your imagination.  We have at least $1,000 for the winner of the contest.  Maybe more.  Maybe more.  Also, your last chance to get Halloween tickets today, right after this show, when we do the walkover to XM to continue the show, we'll have Halloween tickets today, okay?  And also, because we noticed last year, a lot of people have a few Halloween parties to go to.  They go to our party, they hang out for a while, and they leave to go to other parties. 
[01:15:00]  So there will be a chance to get into the party tonight if you want to wait online outside the Hard Rock Cafe, okay?  Right.  As people leave, we'll let more people in.  Did you happen to see the Paul Stanley picture of us on FMQB?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's hysterical.  It's Paul Stanley, of course, looking like the rock star that he is.  You guys with the microphones and the little headsets on, talking to Paul Stanley, and me looking like somehow a homeless guy got a microphone. 
[01:15:30]  I got my big homeless guy jacket on.  Like, everyone else is still dressed pretty cool.  Yeah.  Like, it wasn't that cold out, so you got normal, you know, clothes on.  And you're walking down the street with Paul Stanley.  And I'm in front with this big bundled Arctic jacket on, looking ridiculous.  Ah, we're used to it.  There it is.  We're used to you looking like that, though.  Look at how stupid that looks.  We're used to you looking like that, so.  I know.  We didn't even notice.  I'm an ass.  That was a lot of fun with Paul Stanley yesterday.  We had the biggest crowd for the walkover yesterday. 
[01:16:00]  He was very cool.  He was a great guest.  And to the listeners, if you have photos of me and Paul talking, would you email them to me at Yellow Treats?  I would love to have all that stuff, man.  Aw, Jimmy.  Yellow Treats at AOL.com.  It was great, man.  All right, let's get back into the block.  So the ONA pest got a hold of this lady, this do-gooder.  She wasn't happy with the Fatty Pig Fatty contest, which, by the way, has only an hour left.  Because she's a Fatty Pig Fatty.  We have the big check in the corner here.  If someone could beat 505 pounds in the next hour, come on down, man.  Come on down. 
[01:16:30]  The check is waiting for you.  $10 a pound plus the $1,000 finder's fee.  So this girl had a problem with the contest.  She wrote it on a Yahoo group called Don't Tell Me What Size I Must Be.  We just read her post.  And then, of course, we love them.  The ONA pest got involved.  Someone noticed this was going on, and they all attacked.  Yes.  And the names and the comments.  Yeah.  Always fun.  Yeah.  The first one is anonymous.  I don't know why.  It says, how about a nice, juicy burger fatty? 
[01:17:00]  There's a sympathetic post.  Yeah.  And then an anonymous...  Wait a minute.  Okay, here we go.  Ramon, get this fat...  A pig mask and a T-bone steak.  Which 401 posted, Ant?  Well, that would be Frederica Bimmel.  Frederica Bimmel.  She checked in.  I think it's terrible what shows like this or even the John Mark Carr and John Ramsey show does to heavier people. 
[01:17:30]  There's nothing wrong with being a size 14, Frederica Bimmel.  And then Paul R. Nelson.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  Nelson.  He said, as a hockey dad, I find it hard sometimes for my wife and I to eat properly.  And this kind of insensitivity is wrong, unkind.  And, of course, he's emphasizing the wrong kind in that. 
[01:18:00]  Right.  Wrong, unkind.  And can hardly be approved by anyone.  Did you say Paul R. Nelson?  I did.  Right about now.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  Check it out now.  Yeah.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  Right about now.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  Check it out now.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  Right about now.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  Check it out now.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  Right about now.  About now.  About now. 
[01:18:30]  About now.  Paul R. Nelson.  Paul R. Nelson.  Thank God almighty.  Paul R. Nelson.  I'm Paul R. Nelson. 
[01:19:00]  I've been shot and killed in Dallas, Texas.  Paul R. Nelson is dead.  Paul R. Nelson, tear down that wall.  Right about now.  Paul R. Nelson.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  I'm Paul R. Nelson. 
[01:19:30]  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  Right about now.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  Paul R. Nelson has left the building.  How great is that?  I love the Paul R. Nelson song.  He should use that.  Yeah.  His campaign song.  That's some great production right there.  Thank you to the person who sent that in, the Paul R. Nelson Mega Mix. 
[01:20:00]  We should throw that up on the site.  A lot of people are requesting that.  All right.  Sorry, Anthony.  Back to the blog.  Oh, yeah.  Celebrity checked in.  Yeah.  Wow.  Robert Reed.  You might remember him as the dad from the Brady Bunch.  He says, I have the best weight loss program.  And then he kind of just dies.  Oh, that was the heart monitor?  Yeah, that was the heart monitor.  I need a longer beep.  Yeah. 
[01:20:30]  Yeah, heart monitor.  That works for both heart monitor and curse.  Yeah.  Go cry into a cheesesteak, fatty.  And then look, Lil' Connor.  Oh, check it in.  Lil' Connor says, my mommy gained some weight and daddy took her fishing.  Just saying.  Steve Carr checked in at 1023? 
[01:21:00]  Yeah, Steve Carr checked in.  Do we have the actual clip?  I think we might because he talked it out.  Oh, boy.  Of course we do.  No, it's not.  It's so confusing between the two studios.  I can't have the curses on this one.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  Yes.  That's what was posted by Steve Carr.  There you go.  Of course.  Steve Carr posted that.  Well, Louis Twitchell's antennae has a post on here, Anthony. 
[01:21:30]  Oh, he does.  Yeah, go ahead.  Oh, boy.  Oh, I just got...  Because it's Tourette's.  Hi, Sue Ann.  I know what it's like to be poked fun at because I have Tourette's syndrome.  When are these insensitive...  Narrow-minded simpletons going to...  Accept people for the way they are, not stupid tubby...  Berate and abuse them. 
[01:22:00]  Eat my...  False and handicaps.  I should go right ahead and write a...  Lick my...  You fat slob.  Very mean letter to Opie and Anthony's producer.  So they might learn a valuable...  Do a sit-up, you cow, lesson.  And they might learn from the error...  Swallow a big black...  You fun-draining humorless killjoy bitch of their ways.  Thank you for your time.  Go f*** yourself and remember to be yourself one tick at a time. 
[01:22:30]  Opie, you didn't tell me you posted.  Opie posted.  Yeah, I decided to get in on the fun.  Opie said, try some fruit, fatty.  Fruit.  Gotta love the references to the show.  Wow, look at this one.  Diane, I can smell your...  All right.  Love your son, Frank.  And someone just said one bunt noun.  Noun. 
[01:23:00]  A combination of the word belly and c***.  All right.  A grotesquely bulbous area below a woman's belly button and above her c*** opening.  When wearing pants, the upper area appears to resemble a blowfish.  This...  This woman is usually considered un-c***-able.  I bet that fat-ass Sue can't even see her own c*** through that huge bunt in her way. 
[01:23:30]  Wow.  Are you using it in a sentence?  Yeah, well, it's a noun.  Yeah.  Gotta give me an example.  Oh, I wish there was more.  Oh, we can find more.  Dandy.  Let's find more.  That's just horrific.  Ah, let's say hi to Jennifer in Jersey.  Jennifer.  Hi, guys.  How are you?  Ah, you're an awful, awful name.  What?  Ah, your name sucks, but go ahead.  Jennifer sucks?  Ugh.  Well, anyway, I just wanted to call and say that these women that are calling in, you know, 
[01:24:00]  complaining about the contest just need to get a grip.  You know, explaining it away by saying that they have some sort of medical condition or  thyroid condition.  I've had a thyroid problem, God, since I was 18.  Oh, boy.  And I'm not fat, so it's called laziness and self-loathing.  They need to get up, get to the gym, and stop stuffing their faces at McDonald's.  Very good.  Super-sized women.  Yeah.  That was what I call a feel-good phone call. 
[01:24:30]  Yeah.  Super-sized.  Or boring.  I'm super-sized.  Are you?  Let's, uh...  Lust.  Let's go to Phil in Boston.  Phil, what's up?  Phil.  What's going on, guys?  Can you hear me?  Yes, sir.  Yes.  Ned.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Guys, Brock, this ain't going to be a feel-good phone call, all right?  Yeah.  Uh-huh.  All right.  The other day I was at Dunkin' Donuts, I seen these two buffalo loading up on donuts  and recharging their credit cards there.  Buffalo.  And then they get out, they go out to the parking lot, each of them get into their own 
[01:25:00]  SUV with handicap tags parked in the handicapped parking spot.  I'm telling you, I want to throw up a tree stand and start doing some hunting right there.  Because they're fat, so they're legally handicapped.  There was nothing else wrong with them.  They had handicapped tags on their cars, and they were loading up on donuts and fucking  recharging their...  Oops.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  They were recharging and...  You see that on vacation sometimes, fat people on little rascal scooters just because 
[01:25:30]  they're fat.  One more from Natalie in Michigan.  Natalie.  Hey, guys.  Sorry about your tigers.  Hey, Natalie.  Hey, how are you?  Guys, I think the contest is fantastic.  I'm going to agree.  There are women who keep themselves, you know, nice looking, cut their hair, do something with  some makeup.  I work in an office where they are literally just beasts.  They have lunch in front of them every time someone goes out to lunch, which is probably 
[01:26:00]  every hour.  Their eyes will glaze over.  Their ears will perk up.  They'll want something for lunch.  They've got two burgers in front of them, wrappers covering their desks.  I think the contest is great.  You've got to have a little discipline in your life.  And then they say they have nothing because maybe before they went to work or at dinner,  it's like, I just had a piece of chicken at dinner, but at work, the whole day is them  stuffing their face, M&M's, Reese's Pieces, lunch. 
[01:26:30]  Exactly.  Burgers and then more candy and crap and cake.  You know what I want right now?  I want Krispy Kreme donuts.  I want Enterman's crumb cake.  I want a big, just sloppy like omelet.  You know what I'm eating?  You know what?  Stupid oatmeal and grapefruit.  I am chewing into a piece of honeydew melon right now.  You know what I want?  You know what I love?  And we're not even fat.  It's like a barian cream donut from Dunkin' Donuts.  That's right.  That is the best. 
[01:27:00]  I would love something just sugary.  A sugary treat with plenty of goodness.  But I eat the oatmeal.  I want to try to stay in shape.  Wonderfulness.  I eat the oatmeal and the stupid fruit.  I don't enjoy this breakfast every morning.  I eat an egg white omelet.  And if it's on a bagel, I only eat half the bagel.  You make choices every day.  I want Krispy Kreme donuts.  That's what I really want. 
[01:27:30]  And I'm not saying it because I'm skinny or anything.  I used to be of fat.  But I went to the gym last week because I was disgusted by what was going on.  You got bat wings, Natalie?  No.  Can you jump out of a tree and fly to another one?  No.  I'll tell you the last time I had it.  I like eating dessert.  I have a sweet tooth.  I would eat dessert every night.  Every night I crave desserts.  I was in San Francisco.  Yeah.  And I wanted some desserts.  So I ordered a sundae, a banana split, but I only had one scoop of ice cream instead of three. 
[01:28:00]  There you go.  How about none?  Well, you know what, though?  But then I haven't had one since.  So you got to tell you once in a while if you're going to have it.  If you don't eat like a complete slob.  Add an N and turn that one into none, Jimmy.  I want something sweet.  All right.  We'll move on.  The problem is the next day is all of a sudden you go, you know, I had one yesterday.  Maybe today will be good.  And then what happens is you'll say to yourself, you know, I had one the last two days.  I think you understand where I'm going with this.  The sweetest boy in the world should be allowed.  Do you know, somebody once told me that my smile most resembled the sunlight. 
[01:28:30]  No doubt.  All right.  Well, listen.  We got the check, the big oversized check in the corner.  Oh, there it is.  We're going to announce the winner of the Fatty Pick Fatty Contest.  It looks like it's going to be Honey from Binghamton.  We're going to have to get her on the phone and congratulate her.  But you have an hour.  If you're fatter than 505 pounds, easy money today.  Easy money.  Just show up in the next hour. 
[01:29:00]  And you walk away with that big oversized goofy check.  There's no name written on it right now.  There's no amount written in the check right now.  Nope.  So it's open.  It's still open.  We got one hour left in the Fatty Pick Fatty Contest.  And anyone that brings her down, $1,000 bounty on you.  I'd see a stranger on the street.  I swear I would drag her up here.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, say hey.  It's over five grand for you, $1,000 for me.  All right, it's Halloween.  We got a little story here.  Halloween is an exciting time for children, but also nerve-wracking for their parents. 
[01:29:30]  One major concern for everyone.  All those sex offenders who are out there, that is why there's a system in place for local  and state police officers to make sure children are safe.  Look, I hate sex offenders like everybody else.  Give me one case today.  One case of a sex offender attacking a kid on Halloween.  Stop with the fear on TV.  Give me one case.  Google it.  Right now.  Homework assignment.  Homework.  Enough with the fear.  Poor listener. 
[01:30:00]  Plus, the fact, most of the parents don't even, you know, leave their kids alone on Halloween anymore.  To make sure children are safe.  One item that is new this year, registered sex offenders on parole will have to answer their telephones  as officers make check-up calls throughout the night.  Close to 2,000 registered sex offenders in New York State are on parole.  Also starting at 3 p.m. today, they are requested to stay in their homes until 6 a.m. tomorrow.  Sex offenders cannot wear costumes, have decorations at their homes, or open their door to children. 
[01:30:30]  Parents, we...  But they just like Halloween like everyone else.  If I was a sex offender and the parole officer called, I would just answer the phone.  Hello?  No, mister.  He's not here right now, but he told me to wait in the room.  Poor guy's can't wear costumes.  Can't even wear a costume.  Can't even wear a costume.  What you want to do is put a sheet over your entire body and dress as a snowy landscape 
[01:31:00]  with a beacon poking through it.  Is there anything wrong with that?  Trying to put that together on the fly.  It didn't work as well.  It's a festive time for everybody.  You can't even wear a costume.  Yeah.  And I'm sure some of these sex offenders out there do have a sense of humor.  Do they have the balls to, yeah, make believe their kid when they call?  Dress up.  Dress up in a little costume.  Why not?  Don't wear a mask at their homes or open their door to children.  Parents we talked with say they appreciate the work law enforcement does 
[01:31:30]  and that they do their best in keeping their children safe.  Our building on the Upper East Side, where we stay inside the building,  and, you know, when you go to neighbors, there's a sign-up sheet.  Everyone in the apartment that is willing to have trick-or-treaters has signed up.  And so those are the houses, and only those houses I'm going to allow my kids to go to.  Registered sex offenders are also subject to unannounced visits from police and parole officers.  A little tune-up.  They walk in and just beat them. 
[01:32:00]  You know what I'm doing just to annoy people in my building?  I signed up for Halloween, and whenever my bell rings, I'm going to peek through and go,  I'm not supposed to open the door.  I'm a sex offender.  I'm going to close the door, and they're heartbroken little faces.  Oh, man.  I would just parade kids on the sidewalk outside these homes and just go,  Na, na, na, na.  Look what I got.  Na, na, na, na, na.  Look what you can have. 
[01:32:30]  I very rarely will toot my own blog, which I haven't updated in over a year,  but on my jimnorton.blogspot.com, last year I believe I did a Halloween writing called Boo.  Boo.  Yes, it was about Halloween, so if you want to read it, you can go.  Very good.  Feel free.  Feel free.  All right, we've got to take another break.  Feel free.  Wow.  Laszlo's here with some audio from GTA.  It's official.  We're all in the latest Grand Theft Auto game.  Yes, we are. 
[01:33:00]  He's got some samples of our work.  Cool.  That will appear in the game.  We'll talk to him next, okay?  Anything else going on, Kenny?  Why are you smiling like a creep over there?  Oh, creepola back on mic.  No, I'm happy that it's Halloween, and I'm enjoying the show today.  You guys are very entertaining.  You forget that sometimes.  We should have made you wear a costume today for the walkover.  Oh, come on.  That would have been hilarious.  Oh, come on.  He really doesn't want to go.  He would have, though, if we told him to.  Yeah, I mean, I do what I'm told, but please. 
[01:33:30]  Maybe just run down to Dwayne Reed or Rite Aid and get, like, a Casper mask or something.  What about a fairy, like, little things that a fairy would wear?  Like, maybe some sort of a thing on his head where he has to carry a wand?  And I say something like a sweet girl's mask.  A little tiara.  Can we get a tiara for Kenny or something for the walkover today?  And a little magic wand.  Yeah, Danny, could you get him a Halloween costume real fast from Dwayne Reed? 
[01:34:00]  By the way, when we get back, we've got to do the Dwayne Reed sex toys story.  It's terrific.  And the old bags that they interviewed for the story are terrific as well.  And Ann had some great observations about the story.  I hope I remember that.  But first, it's Stephen Lynch and his Halloween song as we go to break.  Thinking of all the cool creatures that I will meet tonight. 
[01:34:30]  Ghosts and goblins and witches roaming the streets in moonlight.  Bowls of candy and goodies, delicious and waiting in store.  The sound of cute little footsteps as they approach my front door. 
[01:35:00]  Letting the children inside to drink beers.  Razor blades hidden in three musketeers.  Screams from the basement of kids begging to be set free.  That's what Halloween means to me.  Scary.  Tightening the clamps that are holding their little heads so tight. 
[01:35:30]  Putting my lips to their ears as I whisper,  Please, don't fight.  I promise I'll let you go home if you swear not to tell a soul.  Well, I'll just untie these.  I'm kidding.  Now where is my chainsaw?  Let's rock and roll.  A pinch of your brother, a teaspoon of you. 
[01:36:00]  With the head of your sister would make a good stew.  I'd give you a taste, but your tongue's in the stew.  Irony.  That's what Halloween means to me.  Now nothing on the irony part?  Nothing?  Alright.  Trick or treat, smell my feet.  See, irony is an incongruity between what's expected and what actually happens.  So, I can't, you can't taste it because your tongue is in the sand stew. 
[01:36:30]  See, I mean, maybe it sends a signal to your brain, but you can't really.  Trick or treat, smell my feet.  Damn it!  Give me something good to eat.  I gotta change that line.  Trick or treat, smell my feet.  Give me someone good to eat. 
[01:37:00]  Halloween!  Yeah!  David Lynch, Halloween, from his new CD, The Craig Machine.  I'm changing that line.  No, that's funny.  Nobody ever laughs with their lines.  Opie and Anthony, Jim Norton, and the comedians of the Opie and Anthony show will be appearing  in the holiday issue of FHM on newsstand soon.  Opie and Anthony will be signing copies of this special FHM issue tonight at the Hard  Rock Cafe Halloween Show.  Hear what everyone else is talking about.  O&A, uncut, and live, continuing the show on XM Satellite Radio starting at 9 a.m. Eastern. 
[01:37:30]  Visit xmradio.com to subscribe.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Ah, yes, the Opie and Anthony Show.  Let's say hi to Antonio in Yonkers.  Antonio, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Listen, I think you gotta get that guy to sing the Monster Mash song today.  Club Soda Canning should sing Monster Mash in honor of Halloween? 
[01:38:00]  Yes, I think he's got the perfect voice for it.  He really does.  He's gonna sing a song at the Halloween party tonight, that's for sure.  But we'll try to get him to do Monster Mash before we go off the air here.  And Anthony?  Yeah.  Yo, you're very funny, yo.  Yo.  Thank you.  Very funny, yo.  Thank you, my friend.  All right, have a good one.  All right.  We got Laszlo in studio.  Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories is out.  I've been chasing Anthony.  Yeah, where are you?  Yeah, thanks, Laszlo, by the way. 
[01:38:30]  We're networked.  Yeah, Laszlo just handed out PSPs to everybody, so now so much for a radio show.  Who is that?  And we're all networked.  Yeah, this is great radio.  I'll just sit back and watch you play PSP.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  Yeah.  Who was that?  I don't care.  I just killed somebody.  I'm very happy with myself.  Anthony's running around in a car. 
[01:39:00]  Why am I black?  I really don't know if we need to bring Brown versus Board of Education into this debate.  All right.  Oh, okay.  Being Sicilian.  You know, the Moors.  That was actually one of the first things that Opie said when I brought him in the studio to character voices.  He wanted to know what color he'd be in the game.  Yeah, and I see it's on the list of audio to play here.  Thanks, Lazlo.  We just rolled tape when I had everybody from the O&A show in the studio and got a few outtakes here and there. 
[01:39:30]  Anthony plays an old-timey radio host from the 1940s.  Back when things were, you know.  The good old days.  The good old days.  The only person I don't see.  Because I'm completely fixated on it now.  Yeah, the only person I don't see on this list is Jimmy.  But Jimmy is the star of Bully.  That's right.  Jimmy's all over the new game Bully.  That's right.  But Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories, the game's out today for PSP?  Came out this morning.  Thank you, Rockstar, for my copy. 
[01:40:00]  I got mine.  Very happy.  I play a cop and a staff sergeant in the game.  Anthony plays an old-time radio announcer.  Club Soda Kenny plays a character called Derek the Dodo.  Derek the Dodo?  Yeah, he's also a cop in the game as well.  Should we announce what E-Rock is?  Yeah.  E-Rock plays a gay jogger in Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories.  And the best part is you can chase him around the game and shoot him. 
[01:40:30]  Yeah.  Here, Anthony, here's your Grand Theft Auto Coke mirror.  Look at that.  That is a great Coke mirror.  Oh, wow.  It really almost makes me want to go back to doing cocaine.  Because it's such a cool mirror.  We had another item for you that I was going to bring, and it was this beautiful, looks like an AK-47.  It's a fully auto BB gun, and it's got the Grand Theft Auto logo that's in the stock of it.  And then I was listening to the show, and I heard Obi jump on a homeless man's cake and thought, 
[01:41:00]  you know what?  Maybe bringing a full auto BB gun to the show is not a good idea.  Oh, yeah.  What?  Oh, stop proshooting me.  Oh, why?  What?  What?  What?  So E-Rock plays a gay jogger.  Than is in the game as a homophobic plumber.  Than, really?  Derek is an interior decorator in the game.  And finally, Steve, the golfer. 
[01:41:30]  Ah.  You want to hear some of the audio?  Please.  All right.  This is audio that's in the game, except for this first clip, because you decided to bring  this in, I guess.  Yeah.  It was a little outtake.  All right.  This is an outtake.  It's just sort of rehearsing your lines.  And the great thing was that Rockstar has this amazing facilities.  They've got this surround sound studio.  And so Opie comes by, and the biggest question everybody has is, how old is his girlfriend?  That's what they wanted to know?  They were very smitten by her. 
[01:42:00]  She's beautiful.  She's beautiful.  Why do I only got...  Oh, that's because...  All right.  Why do you only got...  That's because I was all right.  I still got the Stephen Lynch in here.  Ah.  That'll do it.  All right.  So here we go.  Audio from Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories.  Starting with an outtake by myself here, I guess.  Tim gave everything he had to our country.  Wrong one.  What the hell is going on? 
[01:42:30]  I don't know.  They gave you the wrong CD.  Why would I have the right CD?  Why?  Why would I have the right CD?  Yeah.  You don't want that one.  That one's got a curse.  Take three.  Trying to start this bit.  That one's got a curse in it.  Well, you know, the characters everybody plays in the game, when you walk the streets of the game,  there's people on the street.  If you bump into them, they say one thing.  If you pull a gun on them, they say another thing.  If you slam into E-Rock, he gets a bit sissified and runs off.  Like real life.  Yeah, correct.  All right.  Here we go. 
[01:43:00]  Here's me as a cop.  Do a twinkle-toed maggot.  So it's twinkle-toed maggot, right?  I'm going to look black in the game.  I know it.  Twinkle-toed maggot.  And your character's not black.  Actually, Opie's a cop.  So if you shoot somebody in the game, or you're just sitting there punching somebody,  or you steal a car in front of Opie's character, he will chase you down.  Chase you down and yell opi-isms at you?  Right.  Right on.  In fact, he did some ad-libs in the studio that made it into the game. 
[01:43:30]  Oh, thanks.  Well, ad-libbing.  All right, yeah.  Wow.  The Jim Norton School of Acting.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I learned from Jimmy.  Yeah.  I'm a black ninja, mother...  Oh, really?  That made the game?  That made the game.  Unedited?  Without the bleep.  Oh.  Nice.  Nice.  You're going to have to look for that one.  Wow.  That's what you hear when Opie's chasing you with a gun out.  Shoot his balloon knot!  Shoot his balloon knot.  I think that was some of my improv, huh? 
[01:44:00]  Yes.  In the game.  Look at that.  In 1984.  I really don't know if that term was...  Yeah.  It might be some kind of a continuity problem there, but it's fun.  And the other thing that we did, we reserved some lines for Opie to be a staff sergeant  in the game, so we actually send you out on a mission in sort of those animated sequences  between the missions.  He sends you out, and he's a staff sergeant on the base.  And here's an example of that.  It's going to sound a lot like the cop.  There you go. 
[01:44:30]  Very multifaceted.  I don't have much range.  You brought a whore onto the base?  Have you no shame, boy?  Are you a moron?  Is that it?  He's going to win a BAFTA.  Wow.  That's wonderful.  All right.  We move on to Anthony.  Oh.  So, you know, there's radio stations in the game that you can listen to while you drive  around.  Always love tooling around the radio stations.  Yeah.  The talk radio station, we did a spoof of old-timey talk radio.  Old-timey. 
[01:45:00]  And I spent a couple of weeks just listening to old talk radio shows, and the one that  we did that Anthony was the announcer of was called The Time Ranger, which is a gentleman  who travels through time by, how do you put this?  By taking care of himself.  By taking care of himself.  Yeah.  Somehow that makes him travel through time.  Because we all sort of travel through time while taking care of ourselves.  Right.  Wow.  You know?  Yeah.  In some way, shape, or form.  You can stop until 8 o'clock. 
[01:45:30]  What happened?  Where did the day go?  My God.  I spent all day doing this.  My calves are locked up.  My back hurts.  I'm fired.  Well, that's time travel for you.  What's great about these old-time radio shows is the men are so rude to the women.  Yeah.  If you listen to these 1940s shows, every time the woman speaks, like, shut up, dame.  Let a man think.  The good old days again.  Let a man think.  So, yes, this is Anthony as the announcer on The Time Ranger. 
[01:46:00]  The Vice City Broadcasting System and American Oil and Motors presents The Time Ranger.  He's Ernest Kegel, a man who has a time machine in his pants that, when he masters, he travels  back in time to right wrongs, save women, and pleasure himself.  That's really good.  Hey.  Really good.  Old-timey radio.  Old-timey.  That's very cool.  And so, you know, in the game, there's a gun shop. 
[01:46:30]  You can go buy the essentials, like flamethrowers and howitzers and stuff.  All the good stuff, yeah.  It's called AmmuNation.  Yep.  And we were looking at some of the stuff from the NRA in the 80s.  You know, they've got, like, that Sam the Eagle or whatever it is that they use to teach  kids about guns.  So, we turned our good friend Club Soda Kenny into Derek the Dodo, who teaches gun safety  to children.  Oh, no.  And here it is.  Club Soda Kenny. 
[01:47:00]  Hey, kids.  Why spend Saturday watching boring cartoons about fighting aliens when you can help fight  real, illegal aliens?  Head to some real-life Saturday safety fun at AmmuNation with Derek the Dodo.  Yay!  Hi, kids.  I'm Derek the Dodo.  Today, I'm going to teach you all about gun safety.  Doesn't that sound fun?  Yay!  Hi, Derek.  I love you.  Aw, that's sweet.  What's your question? 
[01:47:30]  Um, when I find a gun at home, did you say to look down the barrel and pull the trigger?  Sure, honey.  Give it a gun.  Like this?  Whoa!  Gross!  You see, girls are stupid.  To heck if a gun is loaded, you should always point it away from you at an immigrant or  a banker.  Yay!  AmmuNation and Derek the Dodo have been proudly bringing gun safety to your community for over  30 years.  AmmuNation, protecting your kids' rights.  AmmuNation!  Club Soda Kenny, star of Grand Theft Auto, Vice City Stories. 
[01:48:00]  Kenny, that is a great job.  That's a great character for you.  I love that whole scenario.  If you go to the, uh, there's more gun safety tips, actually, in the game from Derek the Dodo,  but if you want to see the animated version of him, you can go to rockstargames.com and  click on Vice City Stories, and there's a whole flash animation of Derek the Dodo.  Wow, nice.  Yeah.  With Kenny's voice.  With Kenny's voice.  Fantastic.  Damn, that is funny.  He's also a cop in the game, um, and this was right around his, uh, trouble period. 
[01:48:30]  Yeah.  I thought since he was sort of leaving that part of his life, we'd put him in, uh, kind  of a fictional reality and let him be a cop for a day.  So, uh, he also did some ad-libs here and there about things they used to yell at minorities  or whatever.  All right.  Here's some examples as, uh, uh, cop as, uh, uh, uh, Kenny as a cop, excuse me.  Don't you eyeball me, son.  Huh?  That's great.  Whoa, that would be scary.  I've heard him actually use that.  Really? 
[01:49:00]  Yeah.  And then we got this.  I'll rip your eyes out.  Yeah.  Good.  Good.  And then finally, I'll kill you graveyard dead.  Graveyard dead.  That was an ad-lib on his.  I'm sure he's used that one.  Wow, that's no ad-lib.  That's not that he actually said to a psychiatrist when he asked about that mysterious neighbor  who moved away when Ken was six.  Very good, Kenny.  Club soda, Kenny.  I'll kill you graveyard dead.  Derek the Dodo. 
[01:49:30]  Maybe someone can get a quick costume for tonight.  Derek the Dodo.  All right.  Uh, we move on to E-Rock.  We're all in Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories.  This is a very exciting day for us and the game is available today for the PSP.  E-Rock as Gay Jogger.  Nice buns, you jog.  Oh, God damn.  Wow.  You do that a little too well, my friend.  Yeah.  That's acting, huh?  And there's a few lines that can't make it to terrestrial radio. 
[01:50:00]  Uh-huh.  But it made the game?  Yeah.  Oh, absolutely.  Very good.  Yeah.  He tends to offer you services when you pull a gun on him and stuff.  Oh, man.  Hey, can we play that Eric clip again?  This could be better than the Steve clips.  The acting is...  Nice buns, you jog.  Okay.  Okay.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, here's another clip of E-Rock as the Gay Jogger.  I run 15 miles a day, then do coke. 
[01:50:30]  I like shaving.  Can I shave, Mom?  It's a line I tried to get him to be a small child in one of the spoof commercials.  That sounded just like the Gay Jogger.  Yeah.  Exactly like the Gay Jogger.  Very good.  A little role-playing with a diaper on and a large furry man.  Moving on, some examples of the audio in the fine game.  Than, the homophobic plumber.  What's great about Than is he's so sort of deadpan and took a little while in the studio 
[01:51:00]  to get him to come out of his shell.  Sweetie, were you shy?  Aww.  Than's shy.  He was afraid to open that talent door and let it all flow out.  But in the game, his character that walks around is an old white male.  It's a retired plumber-looking guy that is constantly complaining about immigrants and  loves his fortified subdivision, which, you know, explains a lot of Florida.  All right.  Here we go. 
[01:51:30]  I ain't no two-way Johnny.  Oh, wow.  Never heard you like this.  That's good.  Sam's in a little shell.  Two-way Johnny.  Immigrants are nightmares.  Immigrants are nightmares.  I talked over, man.  I didn't realize you were hitting the button.  Here it is again.  The immigrants are nightmares.  Yeah.  And if you bump, if your character bumps into Than's character.  This is what you hear?  Yeah.  You cruising for sex, sicko? 
[01:52:00]  Oh.  This is really cool, man.  All right.  Let's move on here to Derek, the interior decorator.  Who, strangely, sounded more sissified than E-Rock.  Really?  Yeah.  Wow.  Yeah.  I'm going to have to look into that.  Oh, yes.  Hit me.  Yeah.  What a mo.  Wow.  I bet he showed up at Mandel's, too, didn't he?  Yeah.  Those stupid leather open-toed shoes he likes to traipse around the studio in. 
[01:52:30]  Mandel.  What a rush, pastels are.  Very nice.  And finally, we get to Steve, the golfer.  Yeah.  What's that about?  It's about how did your parents die?  He hangs out on the golf course of the game.  So if you bust into the golf course, there's a dude walking around playing golf.  And you bump into him.  He says one thing.  You pull a gun on him.  He says another thing.  You try to chat with him. 
[01:53:00]  He might complain about his wife.  What's your handicap?  Mine's the wife.  Wow.  New Steve acting clip.  I love it.  You know, there's a lot of inner meaning about that.  Oh, wow.  Oh, is that great?  I got to hear it again.  What's your handicap?  Mine's the wife.  What's your handicap?  Had your parents die.  That question just as easily could have been, what's your beard? 
[01:53:30]  Mine's the wife.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  What's your handicap?  Mine's the wife.  Oh, Steve.  That's great.  Steve steals the show.  Thanks, Lazlo.  Dude, I put you at the end.  I didn't think, you know, they'd get to it.  Yeah, I know.  I know exactly why you did that, too.  At least I didn't make you a gay jogger.  Yeah.  No, it just comes out.  Are there more than two Steve clips on the game?  Oh, yeah. 
[01:54:00]  Yeah, these are just some examples.  Yeah, these are just a couple of...  There was commercials, too, right?  Steve is in a couple of the commercials.  That is true.  He's...  We did a spoof on...  You know those action movies in the 80s?  I actually brought one of the things with me, but we can't play it.  But they always seem to have, like, a Native American that was part of the team that when  danger was coming, was sort of like, mmm, trouble coming, you know?  Yeah, I could sense it.  Yeah, exactly.  Fought with a big knife.  Yeah, so we had...  Steve actually does really good character voices. 
[01:54:30]  Oh, does he?  Yes, he does.  He does.  Yeah, it's only when I'm trying to do straight work that it just doesn't work out.  How'd your parents die?  Why not?  Thank you.  How'd your parents die?  Why not?  Yeah.  What's your handicap?  Mine's the wife.  How'd your parents die?  Why not?  And that was really...  Steve just said, it's what I do, straight work.  Yeah.  Things don't work out.  As I stepped into that bear trap, I realized as it was closing on my leg.  Pretty much just enjoy that on your own at home. 
[01:55:00]  And finally, one more from Steve here.  Nine holes are better than one, if you get me.  How'd your parents die?  Why not?  I don't remember that.  You don't remember that one?  No.  Nine holes are better than one, if you get me.  If you get me.  If you get me.  Some kind of Puerto Rican swinger.  Why not?  Hey, Laszlo, that's really exciting, man.  We're all thrilled, man.  Absolutely.  The whole show is in Grand Theft Auto, Vice City Stories. 
[01:55:30]  Except for Jimmy, because he was the star of Bully.  We should have gave him a few lines for this.  Yeah.  You were right in the middle of taping Lucky Louie, and I...  Okay, yeah, do that.  I was fun doing Bully, though.  I enjoyed the whole video game thing.  I think it was a fun gig to do, and I like it.  It's a thrill being a part of this.  You should make the guys...  You've got to put it...  Love the game for so long.  Put someone that looks like Steve and let Steve do his voice.  That's what you have to...  If you're going to caricature anyone...  God, would that be funny.  Like, physically, it's got to be Steve.  Yeah, Steve.  I told Jimmy, I said, are you maybe interested in doing any video game stuff? 
[01:56:00]  He's like, oh, dude, if it's getting protested, I'm in.  Right.  Yeah, I'm all about it.  And we're a big part of the game.  We're all over the game.  Oh, dude, all over it.  You're all over the radio.  Even the radio characters.  So somewhere in the game, you'll be able to pop into one of us.  Yeah.  Yeah.  In fact, of the six, I think there's six cops in the show, three are from this...  In this game, three are from this show.  Hey, that's really cool.  Yeah, Keith the Cop is one of the cops as well.  Is he?  Yeah.  I'd love to hear his acting. 
[01:56:30]  Yeah.  It's probably just like real life.  You'll notice it's absent from this list of stuff.  All right, we've got to take a break.  So Grand Theft Auto, Vice City Stories for the PSP is out today?  That's correct.  The website's rockstargames.com and click on Vice City Stories.  Oh, man, I can't wait to play this.  I'm going home and playing this today.  Thank you, Laszlo.  Thanks, guys.  Stick around.  We've got a little more show to do before we do the walkover to XM.  We've got Halloween tickets for the walkover today.  Don't forget, the Halloween party is brought to you by Saw 3. 
[01:57:00]  If it's Halloween, it must be Saw.  And theater is everywhere.  And we also have a little check, don't we?  Yeah, we'll give away the check to the winner of the Fatty Pig Fatty Contest.  It's a big fat check.  That's right.  That was my out, yeah.  Jim Norton will be appearing on The Late Show with David Letterman Wednesday, November 1st.  Check local listings for showtimes.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Running out of show on this side. 
[01:57:30]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  We're going to leave in about 15, 20 minutes.  We're going to do the walkover to XM.  Today we've got Halloween tickets for the big show tonight at the Hard Rock Cafe.  Once again, really fast.  Let me get this plug in.  I know where you're going.  There's a lot of people.  There's someone on the line.  They're driving up from South Jersey.  They want to know if they can get into the Halloween party.  If you don't have tickets, you can wait outside the Hard Rock Cafe because we know people will be leaving the party because they have other places to go tonight.  At that time, we'll let others in.  So you do have a very good shot at joining us at the Halloween party if you show up at the Hard Rock Cafe tonight, okay? 
[01:58:00]  There you go.  Everyone's laughing because Club Soda Kenny is in his Halloween costume for the walkover.  Take the tag off it, Danny.  And he's going to be singing Monster Mash before we leave to go over to XM.  That is wonderful.  It's some kind of a feathery mask.  It's a big peacock feather coming out of the middle and then black and red feathers all around it with diamonds around his eyes. 
[01:58:30]  And then a big red cape with a big neckled thing that goes up over his ears.  And then the cape.  You look silly.  Looks like he looted it from New Orleans.  Yeah, it looks like some kind of Mardi Gras, some body that was floating down after the levees broke.  Bloated body.  He's not going to need this costume anymore.  I'm taking this.  I'm taking this back to New York. 
[01:59:00]  All right, Kenny, are you getting ready to sing Monster Mash?  I feel like Elvis.  Yeah, because you've got an Elvis collar going and a big cape.  Give him the lyrics so he can practice a little bit in the corner.  I don't want to practice.  You don't want to practice?  You're that damn good, right?  Yeah, I believe in it.  Or is it, what's his character?  Derek the Dodo?  Derek the Dodo.  All right, hey, before we do that, Ant, we've got to do the Dwayne Reed sex toys story.  Yes.  It's terrific.  I guess there's a lot of controversy because Dwayne Reed decided that they need sex toys. 
[01:59:30]  And they're not even really like hardcore sex toys.  You've seen this stuff.  What is it, like powders and lube and things that you sprinkle on and lick off?  Well, they've got some of those.  Do they have massagers?  They call them massagers.  You ever see in the store, it's like massager, and it's got the woman, and she's got it on  her shoulder, and she's making like a hoo face.  And you look, and it comes with different attachments.  Like, come on, you know where that goes.  Right.  You know that attachment isn't for your lumbar. 
[02:00:00]  Shaped like a Stormtrooper's helmet.  What are you, a massager dad?  Dirty old housewife.  Naughty housewife.  What beats the corner of the washing machine does it.  Put an uneven load of sneakers in there.  Go to town.  We thought it was crazy when they started selling milk at Dwayne Reed.  Now they're into sex toys.  They're into, uh, yeah.  They're just trying to get more people into their establishments.  That's all that this is about.  They want to make it so you can go. 
[02:00:30]  It's your one-stop shopping.  Listen to this newscast.  It's hilarious.  It's hilarious where they put the sex toys.  It's hilarious because they have to find old broads because they're the only ones that can be bothered by this.  Just lighten up, everybody.  Jesus.  You can count on Dwayne Reed for one hour photo, aspirin, really anything you might need.  And now add to that list, sex toys.  You go in there for aspirin, you don't go in there for sex toys.  New Yorkers may be a little surprised, but not at all shocked when we told them Dwayne Reed recently began selling erotic toys and passion lotions and oils. 
[02:01:00]  Wait a minute.  They sell condoms in drugstores, so I think it's, for New York, that's a logical extension, to enhance your use of condoms.  Something like that.  All I can, that's all I can say.  The company Kama Sutra is partnering with Dwayne Reed in selling vibrators, flavored condoms, feather ticklers, and edible honey dust.  It's the only thing New Yorkers worried about if the products are out in the open.  We know they are located near the pharmacy. 
[02:01:30]  A chow could pick it up if it's on the outside, too.  A chow?  I'm not too sure about that.  I'm not too sure about that.  A chow could pick it up.  Kenny, he wouldn't even know what it is.  He wouldn't even know what it was.  They come in these colorful little boxes with decorative wrapping on it.  It's supposed to be like this romantic thing.  You pop open the powder, honey powder, and you sprinkle it around.  And even if he didn't know what it is, once he opens it up, you show him how it's used. 
[02:02:00]  And that's called learning a lesson about minding your P's and Q's.  That's called you won't be opening another box anytime soon, will you?  Tear-stained face.  M-Y-O-B, shorty.  That was a different version of the story, unfortunately.  The other one had the old people really outraged.  And they actually showed you where the sex toys are.  In this version, they said the sex toys are near the pharmacy.  In another newscast, they actually showed that the sex toys were right next to the regular children's toys. 
[02:02:30]  It's right next to this game of Candyland.  That's what it was, right?  Yeah.  Just the fact they're still selling Candyland disgusts me.  Candy for mommy and Candyland for the kids.  Yeah.  Poop shoots and ladders is the game that perhaps they're a little confused with.  Yeah, it's just, you get everything back there.  And another thing, I'm more offended and disgusted with some of the medical stuff that's back there. 
[02:03:00]  How about Granny's diapers?  How about that?  You got to walk past those big things.  You think kids aren't asking about that?  Mommy, why are those diities so big?  Well, you know how Grandpa smells?  He wears these.  That's where the Grandpa smell comes from.  Right after that in the aisle should be the rope and stool section as well as the shotgun with the little toe trigger. 
[02:03:30]  Other things that you should consider an option with diapers.  The old people aisle is disturbing.  It's horrid.  Drugstore is like, what is half this stuff used for?  It's just disgusting stuff to keep things that used to be wet dry and things that used to be dry wet.  That's what old people have to buy now.  Other things just to, other stuff just to keep things inside.  Keep it in.  Keep it in.  Things that used to come out.  Things that are supposed to come out.  Now they stay in. 
[02:04:00]  Just padded circles for their old corns.  Just awful.  Stuff that shouldn't, yeah, stuff that shouldn't stay in anymore.  Everything's just old people falling apart stuff.  Right.  They're on like 18 different kinds of medication.  Yeah.  Always.  Always.  I have them like it's a methadone clinic.  I need my pill box.  Oh, the elderly, they're all addicted.  They're all addicted to pills.  By the day, by the hour.  All right.  Popping those caps open.  Is Club Soda Canning ready for his song? 
[02:04:30]  I hope so.  So we're running on a show here because we've got to announce the winner of the Fatty Pig Fatty contest.  Then we're off to XM.  And then the Halloween party tonight at the Hard Rock Cafe.  Going to be festive.  All right.  You're not much.  Turn around.  Here's Kenny.  Here comes Kenny.  Where is he performing, by the way?  Right behind you.  Right.  Kenny, do a test, test, test.  You look good, Ken.  Check.  One.  Two.  One more time.  Check.  Test.  All right.  Very good.  Very good. 
[02:05:00]  All right.  We're setting up the PalTalk camera for the PalTalkers out there.  Yeah.  Who's breathing heavy?  Probably me.  Yeah, he really is.  Why, Derek?  The Dodo?  Because I'm Derek the Dodo.  Oh, my dear.  The Dodo.  Can't you just do it with the mask down?  You've got to get the full effect.  We're taping this for you, too.  Yeah, come on, Ken.  Look at that.  Put the mask down so he screws up the lyrics because he can't read them. 
[02:05:30]  Do you know how the song goes?  Can you raise the camera anymore or is that it?  That's not my camera.  Oh.  Which one?  This one?  Yeah, the other way.  More head room.  That would be E-Roc's camera.  Too much now.  Down.  Wow.  With the lighting, it really looks good.  We're just setting up a two-camera shoot here.  Yeah.  That's very important when you do a radio show.  Everything else, of course.  The camera.  We're just... 
[02:06:00]  The cameras are very important for radio.  We're the only radio show more obsessed with video than radio.  Now, do we have a karaoke version or is he just going to sing over the version?  It's karaoke.  It's karaoke.  Do you know when to kick in or do you need Ant's help again?  You've got to kill me.  All right, Ant.  You'll know, right?  I hope so.  Like the leader of the band.  All right, here we go.  I don't know.  Without further ado, it's Club Soda Kenny and his Monster Mash song for Halloween. 
[02:06:30]  She comes in now.  I was working in the lab late one night when my eyes beheld an eerie sight for my monster  from his slab began to rise.  And suddenly, to my surprise, he did the mash.  He did the monster mash.  The monster mash.  It was a graveyard smash.  He did the mash. 
[02:07:00]  It caught on in a flash.  He did the mash.  He did the monster mash.  From my laboratory in the castle east to the master bedroom where the vampires feast.  The ghouls all came from humble abodes to get a jolt from my electrodes.  They did the monster mash.  The monster mash.  It was a graveyard smash.  They did the mash.  It caught on in a flash.  They did the mash. 
[02:07:30]  They did the monster mash.  The zombies were having fun.  The party had just begun.  The guests included Wolfman, Dracula, and his son.  The scene was rocking, and all were digging the sounds.  Igor on chains, backed by the banging hounds.  The coffin bangers were about to arrive with the vocal group, the Crip Kicker 5.  They did the monster mash. 
[02:08:00]  They played the monster mash.  It was a graveyard smash.  They played the monster mash.  It caught on in a flash.  They played the mash.  Then they played the monster mash.  This got a lot of lyrics.  Out from his coffin, Drax's voice did ring.  Seems he was troubled by just one thing.  He opened the lid and shook his fist and said,  Whatever happened to my Transylvania twist? 
[02:08:30]  It's now the mash.  It's now the mash.  It's now the monster mash.  The monster mash.  And it's a graveyard smash.  It's now the mash.  It caught on in a flash.  It's now the mash.  It's now the monster mash.  Wow.  Then you can mash.  Now everything's cool.  Drax's a part of the band.  And my monster mash is a hit of the land.  For you, the living, this mash was meant to. 
[02:09:00]  When you get to my door, tell them Boris sent you.  What did they do?  They did the mash.  They did the monster mash.  The monster mash.  And do my graveyard smash.  They can do the mash.  It'll caught on in a flash.  They can do the mash.  Then you do the monster mash.  Oh! 
[02:09:30]  Bob Soda Kenny, everyone.  Wow.  Fantastic.  It will caught on in a flash.  It will caught on in a flash.  I've got to add my own little flavor to it.  Yeah, you certainly did.  The flavor of Down syndrome.  That is delicious.  All right, save that for tonight's Halloween party.  We might have to do that again.  Oh, that is fantastic.  Are you all sweating?  It's hot in here with this thing.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[02:10:00]  All right.  We've got to say hi to Honey.  Honey!  Hey, how are you?  Honey from Binghamton.  Yes, me.  Honey?  Hi, honey.  Honey?  Yes?  You are the winner of the Fatty Pig Fatty Contest.  Fatty Pig Fatty.  You are the biggest mess to come in.  No one else even tried to challenge your size.  Oh, yes. 
[02:10:30]  You win $200.  Food stamps.  Are you funny?  It is quite the payday for you.  Yes.  I must say.  You just won $5,050 because you weighed 505 pounds.  Okay.  And I think it was Bob who's a big fan of the Opie and Anthony show.  He gets the finder's fee of $1,000, all courtesy of H57.com, H57 Hootia.  They are in the studio right now to present the check to someone on the phone. 
[02:11:00]  Oh, girls!  Yeah.  Why, honey, can I ask you a question here?  Mm-hmm.  Why couldn't you come down?  Why couldn't I come down when?  Well, today when we were giving you $5,000.  Yeah, why couldn't you come down to $500?  Yeah, why couldn't you come down?  I didn't know that I had to, to be honest with you. 
[02:11:30]  Oh, really?  Oh, boy.  No one told you.  Why would they tell you?  Why would they?  That it would be nice.  Yeah, because it would kind of be nice to have you here, and then we present you with that  big, giant check.  Yeah, but the check would look really small in your arms.  Yeah, you could just fold it and put it in your back pocket like an ordinary person puts  an ordinary check in their pocket.  Did anybody from our show tell you that you might want to come down or you should come down?  No, they did not.  No one called her.  Yeah, why would they?  That wouldn't.  Wouldn't it have maybe been, silly me, whenever a check is presented in the history of the 
[02:12:00]  giant check presentation, it's usually presented to somebody.  You know, someday we're going to, like, figure this radio thing out.  One day.  I really believe one day we'll have it all figured out.  I have never seen the giant check presented to someone that wasn't there to get it.  Right.  Look, there's a giant check.  There's two beautiful girls.  There's everyone responsible for the money.  They're writing the amounts in.  They're putting the name, everything.  And we don't have you here.  Please give it to her that size and make her cash it. 
[02:12:30]  This is fatty, pig fatty winner on it.  Please make her go to the bank with us.  That really would be good.  Yeah.  It reminds me of the day that, uh, boys, Bruce Mittman.  That was the last time I saw an oversized check, Anthony.  Yeah.  When he had to present the oversized check to the shwuggies.  Boys.  Boys.  Boys.  Boys.  I, uh, I can't be, I can't play golf today, boys.  I have to, uh, give this check out.  But, you know, I... 
[02:13:00]  Well, this is anti-climatic.  I really would like, would have liked to...  Who, whose head can roll for this, Opie?  You're, you're good at that.  No, I don't want to be predictable anymore.  I, well, okay, you know something?  So you should fire someone.  No, I want John Minnelli's first input.  Ah, very nice.  First input.  Let's get John Minnelli involved.  Screw that.  Let's go for the first firing by John Minnelli.  First firing.  Wow.  That would be record setting.  Or at least man-on-man backside paddling. 
[02:13:30]  Okay.  Yeah.  With the big check.  Yeah.  So, uh, the official announcement from H57.com.  Yes.  H57, who do you?  You got Honey on the phone.  She's the winner of Fatty Pig Fatty from Binghamton.  505 pounds.  Hi, Honey.  Hello.  How are you?  This is Kathy Dolphin from H57.  Congratulations.  Isn't that funny?  Yes, Jimmy.  Jimmy, I give it to you.  A dolphin talking to a whale.  Exactly.  Oh, okay. 
[02:14:00]  My name is Dolphin.  It is not dolphin, honey.  So just don't you listen to that.  And her name is Wahail.  Listen, you know what, Honey?  You just won, on behalf of H57, $5,050.  Congratulations.  Woo, yeah.  How do you feel?  Fat.  Come on, Honey.  Hungry?  I wish you were here so that we could present this to you.

And if I can do it, you can do it. 
[02:15:00]  And it is fantastic.  I've tried a lot of things.  This is the best, best product.  What do you think, Honey?  Huh?  Do you think you'll try?  Are you listening to me?  She's got pork chops in her ears.  She's thinking about how she's going to spend that money.  Honey.  Honey.  I might even be a root.  What are you talking about?  No, Honey, I just want to know, do you have some kind of a, like, you won a lot here.  Do you have kind of a winner's speech you'd like to give?  What are you going to spend the money on?

How is this stuff South African, by the way?  It's so South African.  Is Honey of color?  Yes, she is.  This is a very South African moment.  It is.  It is.  It's like coming together.  I like it.  All right.  I like it.  And the girls holding up the check, winners of the hottie, hot hottie contest. 
[02:16:00]  Jesus.  Aren't they lovely?  Wow.  With a big space between them where the fatty was supposed to go.  Oh, my God, yeah.  There's just a giant space between two hotties that a giant woman was supposed to be there.  But, no.  But nothing.  Honey is in Binghamton.  Right for fatness.  Honey? 
[02:16:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  What are you going to buy?  You got over $5,000 now that is just being given to you.  What are you going to buy?  A couple of things I need.  Yeah, but give me an example.  We need a little excitement here from your end.  Yeah.  Not from your end.  That's exciting enough.  But from your end.  We ran this contest into the ground.  Give us something.  Yeah.  What are you going to buy?  I don't know.  I'm going to go shopping and buy some new things for the house.  The floor? 
[02:17:00]  I'm teasing, of course.  How about maybe...  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Honey?  What?  Hi.  Nothing in particular, though.  Just go shopping.  Like a shopping spree.  Yeah, pretty much.  Just things you need.  Okay.  That's good.  Do I have to get some clothes or something?  Yeah.  Hey, why don't we say thank you to Honey? 
[02:17:30]  Maybe go and get shooed?  Yeah.  Something like that?  You need new shoes?  Honey?  What?  You need new shoes?  Yeah, I need everything new.  Oh, okay.  You have a lot of cash to spend.  Andrew says it all from Amherst, Massachusetts.  Worst contest winner ever.  She's shy.  Well, she's shy.  She's not the most vocal type.  Be more appreciative.  We just gave you $5,000.  A lot of winners, they really, like, jump around, and they're like, ooh, very happy. 
[02:18:00]  You just seem like, hmm, you know, hmm.  I'm just letting you guys have your fun.  What do you want me to do?  I don't know.  I kind of like.  Jump up and down?  Yeah, exactly.  Well, exactly.  It is Binghamton.  We might feel it.  All right.  San Francisco, 89.  Look, we got to go.  All right, honey.  We're running out of show here.  Maybe she wants to buy some edible underwear, like veal parmesan flavor.  Jesus, Kenny. 
[02:18:30]  Would have been better if you stuck with edible.  Oh, there's the beautiful.  Oh, and not a moment too soon.  Well, honey, thank you for participating.  And Fatty Pig Fatty.

[02:19:30]  See you tonight, folks.  Yeah.  Tonight's party is at the Hard Rock Cafe looking for costumes that have something to do with the Opie and Anthony Show.  It's a hot ticket.  A lot of people are asking how they're going to get in.  Well, form a line outside the Hard Rock Cafe.  As people leave the party, we'll let others in, okay?  We'll see you at XM.  If you're not joining us over there, have a great day.  I can walk on my hands. 
[02:20:00]  I can fart and chew gum.  I play the Opie.  I can ride a unicycle.  I wear a bra and lace panties.  So your talent is being queer, Travis?  It's the Opie and Anthony Walkover Talent Show.  If you have a unique skill, talent, music group, or physical affliction, we want to exploit.  You can email Steve at foundrymusic.com with your ideas, or you can just show up during the walk to XM and start shucking and jiving.  Shucking and jiving?  Jesus, Danny.  I don't write this sh**.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[02:20:30]  The Opie and Anthony XM Walkover begins now.  Outside Free FM in New York City.  Everyone's loving Clef Soda Kenny in his Halloween costume.  Oh, he just looks stunning.  Let's hear it for Clef Soda Kenny.  He looks stunning.  We got the Hootia people leaving with their big check.  I want to bang that chick from age 57.  She's sexy.  Yeah.  Oh, she's lovely.  You like her?  Yeah.  That's like saying you want to breathe, Jimmy.  Yeah, you're right. 
[02:21:00]  There's no surprise there.  The presenters of the Czech girls were very attractive girls in little shorts.  I'll take their age 57 and I'll toss in some IV.  No, you.  Old skateboarding dude.  Hey, dude.  How's it going?  Wow.  Tearing it up.  There's been like, this is the third or fourth attempt.  Doug tried to find your building.  It's really funny.  You're skateboarding.  Yeah, I do.  I wanted you guys to sign it, actually. 
[02:21:30]  I bought a Sharpie and everything.  Sir, were you depressed?  I was going to get flavorful.  Sir, were you depressed when the El Dopa stopped working?  Did you?  I was, I don't know.  I was trying to read about it on the train and everything.  But by the time we got here, all the box scrams.  Smell.  How long have you been skateboarding?  Rotten.  A month and a half.  It's like a rotten meal.  Labor Day weekend.  All right, give us a move.  Give us a move.  Inside of that.  You want to see?  All right.  Smell the inside of that.  After a month and a half. 
[02:22:00]  Hold on.  He's going to give us a move.  Look at this.  I can stand up.  I can actually do that.  It's a stink on wheels.  Golly, bro.  Golly, man.  Undo my Sharpie.  Oh, check.  Yeah, people are noticing that you smell a little bit.  Get off the board.  After a month and a half, I'm pretty happy about that.  Why the smell, though, sir?  Why the smell?  We all want to know why the smell.  Right.  Because I'm homeless.  Oh.  Are you really homeless?  Oh, man.  Nice.  All right.  Yeah.  All right.  Wow.  I can't imagine. 
[02:22:30]  It's amazing how far it's going.  It's so bad.  We're walking.  It's going.  We're walking in the wrong direction.  Yeah.  Why don't we go where the wind blows the other way?  Yeah.  Let's go this way.  Wow.  Oh, he's a ghost.  Holy fuck.  Did that guy stink so bad?  Can't the homeless shower?  Yes.  You know, for our benefit.  Or at least commit suicide.  Oh, sweet.  Thank you.  Pearl Jam plus Nirvana. 
[02:23:00]  Mostly Nirvana.  Live at the Hollywood Palladium 1991.  Is it good quality?  Oh, yeah.  It's like soundboard.  Oh, thank you so much.  That is awesome.  I will not break that.  See, I don't break stuff I want.  Nah, I don't see our pal.  No, Andrew still.  No, he's really dejected because of that fucking cake.  We're waiting for the return of Andrew.  It'll happen.  Why don't we ask his neighbor?  Maybe his neighbor's getting his mail for him.  Yeah.  The big box.  Look at people just throw garbage on top of it. 
[02:23:30]  That's a man's home.  The box is getting nicer and nicer, though.  Yeah.  He's really hooking it up.  You know what we should love him?  We should fucking some kerosene in a match.  The guy wants to sell.  This guy has a box with a little Entenmann's cake in there.  And inside the lid it says, Halloween tickets?  Treat yourself.  And he's got a hat that says, Kansas, home of the big cock.  Apparently, you would like Halloween tickets. 
[02:24:00]  That is true.  And you brought a cake.  And this is right about the spot where it happened.  Yeah.  Right over there.  What's that?  Why don't you smash it in your own face for tickets?  Do we have tickets?  Yeah, we have tickets.  Bring it over to the spot.  Kenny, with a good idea.  Wow, dude.  For tickets, would you smash that cake in your face?  For tickets?  Yeah.  Well, I think it's kind of hard.  Is it?  It's a cake!  It's an old cake.  Well, then you wouldn't have to take it and, like, wail it, like, punch. 
[02:24:30]  But put it against your face and slowly turn it and grind it into your face.  Like an anus?  Yeah, yeah.  But you don't have to hurt yourself with it.  And then, sir, you would go to our Halloween show this evening.  That's right.  Halloween tickets.  I will do this.  Okay.  All right.  Here we go.  Because I don't have a special skill, but I have an anus-shaped cake.  Yeah.  Put your hat on backwards.  Backwards?  Yeah.  Put your hat on backwards.  Put your hat on backwards.  Put your hat on the cake a little bit in your face.  Put your hat on backwards.  And then suck our dicks.  And then cake right against your face.  Yep.  And now twist it in.  Oh, no.  Now twist. 
[02:25:00]  Yeah.  All right.  Let's hear it for this.  All right.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  All right.  But I earned that cake.  I earned it.  Let's get those cocks out, guys.  He agreed.  Very nice.  Thank you.  And we will be looking forward to seeing you this evening at the Halloween Extravaganza.  At the Hard Rock Cafe.  Wow.  Thank you.  Well, follow us down.  We might give you a place to wash your face off.  Very nice.  In the urinal.  Good job with the cake.  But that's very good. 
[02:25:30]  You're very creative.  Hey, what?  I think we're going to see a lot of cakes tonight.  I'm going to talk to Paul Schaefer over here for a second.  Wow.  Wow.  Kenny, you gave that guy a good mashing with that cake.  It was the monster man.  He's doing the monster man.  Hey, isn't that a Dwayne Reed?  We should see what kind of sex toys they got in there.  Yeah, let's go in and get the mic work in there.  Let's hope so.  Let's try.  Let's see where they are and what they are. 
[02:26:00]  That'd be fun.  Wait.  I did the monster mash.  What's up, Jimmy?  Looks like he's thinking.  I'm trying to think of our organization.  Wait.  You need some kind of a fake name?  We're waiting.  We're waiting.  We object to the sexual nature.  Oh, I gotcha. 
[02:26:30]  Ah, yeah.  Yeah, that'll be believable with this crew.  Citizens upsetting.  Oh, no.  Non-traditional therapy.  Wait.  Citizens.  Citizens.  Citizens United.  Um, no, that doesn't work.  Citizens.  Citizens United now today.  Um.  Ah, I see where you're going.  Uh, cunts under.  No.  No, that's kind of silly.  No toy.  Citizens United.  Like that.  Now today. 
[02:27:00]  It gives it away.  I see that.  Yeah.  Okay.  That's us.  I always hate an abbreviation when they put an of or an a, but it's not accounted for.  But it's not accounted for.  Why?  Like, how come it's not?  Ooh, look at that fucking thing on his head.  That could be the worst wig I've ever seen.  Jesus.  Looks like a blonde doily.  All right.  Citizens United now today.  Buying some sex toys, are ya?  Oh, no.  They have security guards in those places. 
[02:27:30]  We are going to get in trouble, but I don't care.  We should try to do some investigative reporting.  Ah, these two.  Let's ask.  Let's see if we.  All right.  It sounds like we're still on.  Yeah.  Yeah, we're on.  We should be.  We're looking for sex toys.  We're by the nail polish.  I don't see anything.  Citizens United now today.  Excuse me.  You know where the sex toys are?  We heard about it on the news today.  The news?  We're looking for some type of sex toys.  Not by the one hour photo. 
[02:28:00]  That's right.  They only have pornography.  That's right.  That's right.  You come here after the sex toys.  You get developed.  It's by the pharmacy.  It's by the pharmacy.  Where's the pharmacy?  Downstairs.  Oh, the mics aren't going to work.  There's downstairs in here.  They're not going to work downstairs.  Tell them to pick this stuff up because we can't broadcast.  Jesus.  Oh, no.  That's sick.  Look at that Entenmann's cake.  Ask that guy.  Where are the sex toys?  Mister, where are the sex toys?  Sex toys?  We saw today on the news that they sell sex toys here at Dwayne Reed now.  No?  Downstairs in the pharmacy? 
[02:28:30]  Are they by the Halloween costumes?  Edible condoms, we heard.  Ask this lady.  She knows.  You have anything like that?  Downstairs.  Oh, go through this.  Downstairs.  We all got to go downstairs.  We're all looking for edible condoms and sex toys.  Sex toys for everybody.  To make a fortune.  All right.  Oh, God.  And he's looking for a shower.  The skateboarder's here, too.  Jesus.  Somebody's swinging by the right guard aisle.  How dare they put it downstairs.  We never broadcast from down there.  Exactly.  They should know better.  All right.  We're going to have to leave.  There's no way.  This is going to work downstairs. 
[02:29:00]  Sex toys are downstairs, miss.  Downstairs.  Sex toys.  Heard about it on the news this morning.  Let's question people walking out.  Watch out if you go downstairs.  Watch out if you go downstairs.  There's things you might not want the children to see.  That's right.  The children.  Protect the children.  That's right.  And then molest them.  Or are they upset?  They're not happy with us.  It's about 100 people at Dwayne Reed.  Oh, Jesus.  Well, let's go buy a smut magazine.  All right.  Let's go buy a smut magazine. 
[02:29:30]  Hi, my friend.  How are you?  Oh, what's the matter?  You fall down?  You okay?  I scared you?  What happened?  What happened, sir?  Have you been robbed lately?  Where have you been?

It shows more of the tender side of the lifestyle.  Oh, the two.  Everwood.  Unzipped?  When men come together, it's a...  At least you buy something today.  You like that one, Jimmy?  That's the natural.  Kissing?  Which one is that?  Unclipped.

That's a good one.  Wait, get that one out.  Get the one with the two on it.  Get the sensitive.  Yeah.  That one's more sensitive.  I don't know.  The worst part of that, it's not just the kiss or the cocks.  It's the holding of the face.  Yeah, look how he's holding his face.  That's a...  Oh, there we go.  Oh. 
[02:30:30]  Oh, look.  He's got his little hat on like E-Rock.  That one looks like...  Yeah.  He had to turn his hat around.  Oh.  Kids are walking by.  All right.  Get them in here.  Wow.

Transformation.  What's that about?  Uh-oh.  That one in plastic, though.  What's transformation about?  That's going to cost a few... 
[02:31:30]  Transformation that they're changing their sex, my friend.  Oh, they don't like their dicks, so they...  Right.  Yeah, I gotcha.  They're becoming like these chrysalis or pupas.  Yeah, you got it.  How long have you been here, sir?  I'm here 25 years.  25 years?  Yeah.  Yeah, so you've seen them all.  Where do you go to the bathroom?  Going in the building.  The bathroom is not a problem.  No.  That little bucket back there for you to drop logs in?  Oh, no.  A little bucket.  Hey, make sure you push our FHM magazine.

Yeah, I hope.  Today, maybe.  Today?  All right.  Oh, that'd be good.  We'll come by later this week, and we'll prove that we're in the magazine.  This guy's on 6th Avenue and 57th on the...

What's your handicap?  Mine's the wife.  Oh, boy.  Uh-oh.  Oh, boy.  Oh, we got plenty of time.  Oh, boy.  What's your handicap?  Mine is this dirty appendix hanging between my legs.  Okay, Kenny, what a fool he looks like. 
[02:33:00]  Oh, he looks like a buffoon.  He looks ridiculous.  That guy's very proud of his dick magazines over there.  He sure is.  He couldn't say enough good things about them.  He loves them.  He's pointing out ones, suggesting them.  I've fucking seen parents of honor students aren't as proud.  Oh, God.  Why is this guy keep fucking crossing my path?  Homeless guy stinks.  He's all right.  He's a good egg.  Oh, he smells horrid.  He's a good egg.  He smells like a piece of shit on wheels. 
[02:33:30]  The homeless.  Don't you have homes?  All right.  Nothing new on the wall.  Nope.  With a push of this Barry Manilow shit.  Wow.  Well, new body.  Some of our...  I think the guys in those magazines we were just looking at enjoy that type of music.  Is that a Halloween costume or is that how he goes to work every day?  I don't know.  Sorry.  All right.  Is that it?  Yeah, I believe on this Halloween. 
[02:34:00]  Okay.  Look at this guy.  Gentlemen.  Look.  Here's a guy in costume.  He's dressed like a failed douche.  Fucking asshole.  All right.  Kenny, you got an announcement?  Gun blocker.

We'll go back in inside and start up our other part of the festivities.  Thank you.  Wait.  The building thing is sticking out.  That what?  It looks like the building is fucking him.  Look.  Oh, Jesus.  Where?  Look.  He's getting fucked in the ass by the building.  Oh, okay.  The XM202. 
[02:35:00]  They are the most vile, despicable human beings in the country.  Creeps.  Ankle biters.  Obviously, the strength is their ability to turn mistruth into something people would believe.  Wow.  How long is this guy going to continue to babble and say nothing?  All day long.  Shut up.  All right.  Here we go.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  It's worse than I imagined.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry. 
[02:35:30]  We are a bunch of dopes.  I think we're lewd.  We're probably pushing 20 arrests because of this radio show.  Out of touch.  Corn balls.  Three retards.  We have the effect of town hall PM.  Opie.  You know I could have been a model.  Anthony.  I'm Gary.  James Norton.  I like yogurt.  Robert Reed. 
[02:36:00]  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  We'll be right back. 
[02:36:30]  We'll be right back. 
[02:37:00]  We'll be right back. 
[02:37:30]  We'll be right back. 
[02:38:00]  Turkey chili.  I'm selfish. 
[02:38:30]  I'm a selfish guy.  No, I don't think so.  I mean, we just did the walkover, and we don't get a break, so.  I'm selfish.  I'd eat something.  I should have thought of the listeners, though, and still listen to meh, meh, meh, meh for ten minutes.  Do the listeners ever think of us?  I, uh, no.  Do they ever care about us?  No.  I don't think they do.  I don't see it.  Now let me pop up a pal talk.  Hey, we got to get to this one story we didn't get to, by the way.  Which one?  Is it the hot one?  How could you not want to talk about that?  It's the sexiest thing I've read in a long time. 
[02:39:00]  All right.  Is it about a certain young man?  Yes, right.  And a girl of his fancy?  Yes.  Doing what every boy wants to do.  Let's go to Brian in Toronto.  Brian.  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Hey.  Love the walkover.  Love when you guys go from the censored to the uncensored.  Love the show.  Think you guys are hilarious, even up here in Canada.  And I really like the fatty pig, fatty.  You guys should do a skinny, sick, skinny and see how skinny girls can get.  You know, it's funny you say that because we had mentioned doing just that. 
[02:39:30]  Nice.  Because we think it would be great to get the skinniest girl in, like, anorexic or bulimic or some other type of white.  How skinny do you think they get?  You think they get sub-70 pounds?  Can they do that?  Dare to dream, my friend.  Dare to dream.  Well, we're hoping for, like, primordial dwarfs.  Dwarfs and stuff like that.  Yeah, they could throw a curveball in there where they're not just skinny, but they turn out to be a primordial dwarf or some type of thing. 
[02:40:00]  But I'm looking for shoulder blades just poking out the back.  Oh, just counting the ribs.  Just looking at them.  Sticking up the thigh.  Old xylophone ribs.  Well, we start on big hip bones just jetting out.  We did start our new contest, by the way.  Which one?  The Jimmy Norton hairdo contest.  That's a good one.  I like it.  It's just a cute contest.  I don't know if we're going to have a prize, but there's a hairdo that Jimmy was sporting a while back.  It's now on opianthony.com, and we're looking for the listeners to beat that hairdo. 
[02:40:30]  And we don't want wigs.  We want actual hairdos.  Yeah, because when I was a boy, I was voted boy with the sweetest hairdo.  I don't doubt that.  I was.  They give awards out in my town.  I'd win them every year.  You won every award in your little town.  That's going to be on the website?  I told you, I won a boy with the sweetest smile in town, and everyone picked the Wilkins boy to win.  But the night before the contest, there was a fire, and the Wilkins boy was burned beyond recognition. 
[02:41:00]  Now he's got that permanent smile on.  He always looks smiley and perplexed.  Why are your eyes so wide?  Oh, yeah.  Lidless goose.  Oh, look at people planning pre-parties.  Where?  I can't tell.  Why?  It's a pest pre-party.  What?  They don't want other people showing up at their pre-party?  Only pest.  Only pests are allowed at the pest pre-party?  I would guess that would be enough. 
[02:41:30]  Hey, what's Happy Typing Girl dressing as?  I want to know what she's coming out to the party tonight.  It's probably something sexy that shows her off.  She'll probably dress conservative like a nun.  I want her to dress really naughty.  Let's say how to rob on Long Island.  Rob?  Rob?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  You guys can play Eric's lines from Grand Theft Auto, the ones that you weren't able to play on regular radio?  Yeah, we could do that.  Is Laszlo here?  I think he has a few other things, too.  All right.  Love you, Larry.  All right, thank you.  Not a bad idea.  Not a bad place to start. 
[02:42:00]  The second half of the show.  Laszlo.  I've got to tell you, man, we are really excited.  No joking, man.  I know, that is so cool.  Like, pretty much everyone that is associated with this radio show, on a day-to-day basis,  anyway, is featured in the new Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories game for the PSP.  And I love when Opie was recording his lines.  He would do a line, and he would look through the glass at his girlfriend to see if she was  impressed.  You know, like what I did there, baby? 
[02:42:30]  Why are you busting on me today?  No, it was very cute.  Like what I did?  Threw your heart into it.  Now, I brought some extra tracks, but not of anything E-Rock.  I got one of Danny.  Dirty tracks that we couldn't play over there?  Yes.  And these are going to be in the game, or are they out there?  They are in the game.  Okay.  This is Danny.  We couldn't play this over at CBS.  I will wipe my face with your ass. 
[02:43:00]  Nice.  Really?  That was something he was just saying to Travis, they caught on tape.  And then this.  I'm a black ninja, motherfucker!  You're laughing.  That's not going to be in the game.  It is.  It's a laugh?  I swear.  One of the testers told me, he was like, is that Opie?  Because I hear a cop, and it sounds like Opie, and he's saying black ninja.  Yeah. 
[02:43:30]  The real line is fuck-faced, though.  And here's another one.  When you've got a high wanted level, you know, you've got several stars, you've been a bad  boy in the game.  Cops are on your tail.  And you're running.  This is what Opie screams as the police officer.  I will take a giant shit on you, boy!  Is there spikes gripping you?  And then finally, what's the Steve one?  Oh, that's not actually profanity.  It's just, uh...  I don't know.  It just...  It was an odd Steve moment in the studio. 
[02:44:00]  Well, plenty of those.  What, do you suck your cock?  No, he's some odd.  Oh.  No!  Okay.  It's like he's resisting in a back room of a game club.  Oh, do we need a couple of these?  You can hear all the excitement in our voices as we're trying to do our lines.  Can we hear that one more time?  Yeah.  Because I know exactly what that is.  No! 
[02:44:30]  Okay.  That was a 30-year period in Steve's life, condensed.  It all revolves around his internal monologue about his sexuality.  All condensed into one second.  No!  That...  Okay.  First comes denial, confusion, and acceptance.  That's everything.  No!  That...  Okay.  Along with what's your handicap, mine's the wife.  Mine's the wife, yeah.  I think my favorite, though, is Club Soda Kenny is Derek the Dodo. 
[02:45:00]  That is a good one.  Steve is right up there, too, but...  Derek the Dodo is hilarious.  And there's a couple of other bits from the game that actually...  Anthony's in, as well as Steve, that we couldn't play over there.  One was a spoof of early 1980s movie trailers.  I forgot what website it is, but you can watch movie trailers from the early 80s.  They are vastly different.  That now it's just like 60 seconds of 80 million shots of helicopters and explosions. 
[02:45:30]  Action, yeah.  And not one shot is longer than a second.  And...  The loud music.  The ones in the early 80s, especially the...  And I didn't bring this one with me, but I love watching the trailers for the slasher flicks.  Yeah.  Those are amazing, because it's always like, hey, if the boobs come out, somebody's about to die.  Yeah.  Do you know how bad fucking trailers are now?  There's a film called He Knows You're Alone, When a Stranger Calls or whatever it was. 
[02:46:00]  And the whole thing is, she's getting calls through the whole film, have you checked the  children while she's babysitting?  And it's terrifying.  And at the end, he's like, we trace the call.  It's coming from inside.  It's a very famous scene.  Yeah.  In this coming movie, they fucking give that line away.  Yeah.  Which I know that their argument would be, well, it's such a commonly well-known thing  that we didn't put it towards the end, we put it in the middle.  Well, the movie is like 30-some-odd years old, so there's a whole new generation that  probably wouldn't know the reveal. 
[02:46:30]  I've seen that.  The big reveal in that movie.  They fucking tell you that in the fucking trailer!  You hear...  So every time she's getting prank called, you now know where it's coming from.  There's no mystery.  Right.  God almighty, Hollywood is run by a bunch of fucking underage, dumb motherfuckers.  A lot of trailers are like that.  They ruin the whole fucking movie.  They're dummies.  Or they show you, like, a pivotal point.  They show you up to a very pivotal point that probably is halfway through the movie.  So, the whole beginning, you know that this point is coming. 
[02:47:00]  Or you know that a couple of guys that are friends at the beginning of the movie, you  see, okay, this changes, and now this guy's trying to kill him.  And you know it already from the trailer, so the whole beginning of the movie, you just  sit there, eh, I know what's happening.  They really fuck him up.  And they put that track under it that makes it seem so exciting.  And you're ten minutes into the actual movie, and you're like, what, huh?  Where?  Where?  Action?  Yeah.  Come on.  So what is this, then?  This is a movie trailer spoof called Exploder. 
[02:47:30]  Exploder.  No, I'm sorry.  Evacuator.  Evacuator?  Yeah, Exploder was in Vice City.  We have this character, Jack Howitzer, who's sort of a spoof on all the action heroes together  from the early 80s.  And all those action movies somehow had Russians involved.  Of course.  Because that was the big menace.  They were the bad guys.  Right.  And you'll hear a cameo there from Mr. Kumia.  Oh.  As the Russian who gets shot to pieces.  Oh.  Tim gave everything he had to our country. 
[02:48:00]  Now he's having flashbacks.  And someone's going to pay.  Howitzer is back.  Evacuator.  Die, you scum!  One man's search for peace.  Good night, bitches!  Yes, I'll kill him before he screams!  One man's search for hope.  Let's do some killing.  Let's kill for the kids.  One man's search for the truth.  After I torched those villages and raped all those schoolgirls, I just can't seem to get 
[02:48:30]  those images out of my head.  He gave everything.  Then the liberals turned their backs on our heroes.  And now he's out for the truth.  What do you smell, Wandering Hands?  Hmm.  Smell fear.  Good.  Let's arm wrestle.  That'd be a different film.  Okay.  Let's kill some commies!  Hmm.  Me find Vietnamese squaw.  He's wrestling the chopper down. 
[02:49:00]  Shoot him!  I'm an American.  And you're not!  So fucking die!  Yeah, he's too strong.  Evacuator.  Let's evacuate these bitches!  Yes!  Rated RP for really patriotic.  Jesus, man.  That is good.  That is not even that far off from an actual trailer from back then.  Holy shit.  I love how Steve plays an Indian called Wandering Hands.  Hmm. 
[02:49:30]  Vietnamese squaw.  Vietnamese squaw.  How did your parents die?  Hmm.  That I'm terrible, I'm sorry.  Hmm.  Heap them, why not?  That is Steve.  Like an old Steve.  Let's go to Brad in Pennsylvania.  Brad?  Uh, yeah.  I was...  I can agree with Jimmy that I saw a lot of Stranger Calls and, like, that trailer just ruined the whole movie.  So we had to sit there for an hour and a half knowing what was going to happen. 
[02:50:00]  Yeah, they just totally wreck it.  Steve is a great American Indian.  His name is Geronaholo.  Let's go to Matt on Long Island.  Matt?  Yo.  Hey.  What's up?  What's up, Matt?  Kneeling bull.  Dances with men.  He's on his knees, Tatanka.  Tatanka.  Come on, I'm the buffalo this time. 
[02:50:30]  Dances with men.  Tatanka.  Oh, that's funny.  Steve.  Matt.  Yo.  Hey.  Hey.  Yeah, I wanted to ask Lazlo why you didn't get, like, Big A to do some voices.  Maybe, like, a big black gang leader or something like that.  Because we don't have that much studio time, my friend.  It's bad enough having to coach some of the halfwits on this show.  Exactly.  All right.  Check their rules.  Maybe for the next game, though. 
[02:51:00]  That's a unique voice.  That's true.  Work it in somehow.  What's this next track here?  I was watching some of the commercials from the early 80s, and the gum commercial that  I really loved was, do you remember Freshen Up?  Of course.  Yeah, that is.  The squirt gum, cum gum, they called it.  And there's this, if you do a search for it on the Google, there's this commercial of  this girl in slow motion taking the piece and slowly putting it in her mouth.  I remember that commercial.  The commercials were so sexual. 
[02:51:30]  They got away with so much in the early 80s.  Even, like, the Underoos commercials were little girls dancing in their underwear.  It was heaven.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But, so, we did a spoof on the gum commercial instead of Freshen Up.  It's called Release.  Gum that shoots a load in your mouth.  Of course it is.  Here it comes. 
[02:52:00]  That taste sensation that makes your breath a great sensation.  Release.  Gum that shoots a load in your mouth.  It's hard.  It's sticky.  When it's soft, it's tricky.  It's the surprise liquid center of Release.  Pow!  Here it comes, boy.  Are you ready?  Are you ready?  Are you ready for...  Pow!  Release.  The gum that shoots a load in your mouth.  I just shot a load in her mouth.  You shot a load in my mouth.  Girls, quench your thirst with the explosion. 
[02:52:30]  Boys, just laugh.  It's the refreshing way to start or end your day.  For fresh breath and a smile, pop it in your mouth and wait for the wow.  Release.  The gum that shoots a load in your mouth.  Pow!  Oh, hey, that's all right, man.  The best is rounding people up.  Shut a load in my mouth.  Jeez.  Rounding people up and going, we're going to sing a little jingle.  Yeah.  It's going to be cute.  I've got to be honest with you, man.  People are going to hear that and think that you're implying blowjobs. 
[02:53:00]  Oh.  That's not what we intended at all.  No, no, I know.  It's just loud.  Yeah.  You know, I didn't even think about that.  Yeah, be careful.  Wow.  There might be a problem there.  Yeah.  They're doing Indian Steve lines on the inside.  Oh, no.  Indian Steve.  Indian Steve.  What's my problem?  You're in my fucking teepee.  I can't do the Indian voice, though.  DJ in a light bulb.  How did your buffalo die?  That was good for one. 
[02:53:30]  DJ.  DJ.  Here we go.  Kneeling Bear is his Indian name.  Yeah.  Very nice.  I should dig up some outtakes from that session, now that I think of it.  Absolutely.  I'm sure, man.  Steve attempting to be an Indian.  Laszlo, once again, we're going to keep this stuff here so we can play it over and over again.  Definitely.  There's more of that in Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories, which came out for the PSP today.  All right.  We're going to take a quick break. 
[02:54:00]  I like breaks.  Yeah, we've got to do the hot story of the day.  Also, some news improv.  Mike Woods.  Oh, no.  No, no, no.  Mike.  The weather guy.  No.  We've got some.  Who's too big for his suit every morning.  Yeah, he's getting bigger and bigger, like buffer, not like fat.  The guy works out like crazy.  He's probably working out so he can beat all three of us at once.  Yeah, he's waiting just to come over here and kick our asses.  He refuses to get a bigger suit for some reason.  Because right where the buttons are on his suit.  They look like they're ready to pop. 
[02:54:30]  It goes all around him as just this ditch where it's much too tight and his shoulders are getting huge.  Yeah, he's getting scary.  Well, Mike Woods and Mark Joyella dressed up as the Skipper and Gilligan.  Oh, no.  They didn't stop it.  No.  And then you get really bad improv from Fox 5 Morning News.  We'll play this when we get back.  Bless you, Fox 5.  The Skipper and who?  And Gilligan.  Who's who? 
[02:55:00]  We'll figure it out next, I guess.  It'll knock you on your goddamn ass.  Jesus Christ, what an anticlimactic piece of crap that was.  Opie and Anthony, Jim Norton, and the comedians of the Opie and Anthony show will be appearing in the holiday issue of FHM. 
[02:55:30]  On newsstand soon, Opie and Anthony will be signing copies of this special FHM issue tonight at the Hard Rock Cafe Halloween show.  All right.  La, la, la, la.  Hey, we were talking in break.  Yes.  Young Anthony said that while we were in Denver, he heard the new – it's Black Sabbath reuniting with Dio, but they're not calling it Sabbath out of respect.  It's called Heaven and Hell with Tony, Bill Gieser, and Ronnie James Dio now are working on some new stuff. 
[02:56:00]  So if anybody out there – Anthony said he heard a new song about that?  I heard a brand new track from them.  I don't remember the name.  I believe the devil was in the name somehow.  But it was really – it was good.  Dio's voice, amazing.  The guy's 60 years old, just still has those Dio pipes, and it sounded, you know, classic rockish.  They're not going to change their sound and have some kind of new fucking, you know, emo sound or anything like that.  But it was exactly what you'd expect out of him. 
[02:56:30]  It was really good sound musically, and like I said, Dio, his voice –  Yeah, we'll try to get him.  Fucking amazing.  We'll try to get a taste.  If anyone has that.  Hey, Roland.  I want Roland to get them in studio.  If Roland can do that, I'll suck his dick on the air.  Wow, again?  On the air, though.  As I say, with a load of fucking yogurt in my mouth.  Yeah, really.  You should have dribbled that down your shirt and then given yourself pink eye.  God, Jimmy.  That's just terrific. 
[02:57:00]  Terrific.  We got to get Roland in here.  He wants to, like, try to push a guest for the show.  That's the new thing, right?  Unless it's an obvious guest, he has to explain himself.  Oh, yeah.  And we got Mike Woods.  You want to do Roland first?  Okay, Roland.  I say –  Let me see if –  One boob or another.  Let me look at it.  Roland, sit down.  I'm going to track two, though.  No, sit down.  I'm not playing no track two.  He's letting them –  Look, he wanted the music to do the talking, man.  You've got to impress me, and then I'll play track two.  Okay.  Ladies and gentlemen, Roland, he's a babbling ass, but he books great guests for the O.P. 
[02:57:30]  Anthony show.  He's fucking Billy Booker.  We love him.  Just on mic, though.  Right.  Like, out there when he's talking on the phone, when he's just conversing.  He's fine, but there's something about a microphone that just – he freezes up.  All right.  Roland, make believe you didn't talk to us.  You're coming in.  What do you want from us?  Cold War Kids are in town until Friday.  They're a new band, kind of like White Stripes.  Cold what?  Cold War Kids.  Cold War Kids. 
[02:58:00]  Kids?  Like a kit?  Cold War Kids.  Oh, kid.  Like a kid.  Kids?  Cold War Kids.  Say it again.  As in drum, kids?  As in drum, kids?  As in drum, kids?  Cold War Kids.  Cold or Kids?  Cold War Kids.  Cold or Kids.  Cold War Kids.  Yeah, they're really good.  Blender, Rolling Stone, Spin, and South by Southwest.  Give them all five stars.  They're the new 8th band.  Oh.  What are a couple of their songs?  Hate Me Up Too Dry is their main single.  It's really good.  They got a hit out there right now?  They do. 
[02:58:30]  They started out on MySpace and then blew up.  On XM, where would they be played?  Probably Ethel.  Ethel.  Ethel and Fred.  I like the Ethel.  I like the Fred.  And they sound like White Stripes?  Yeah, like a raw White Stripes.  It's really good.  A raw White Stripes.  Well, it's...  Isn't White Stripes pretty raw?  Yeah, I was going to say.  The only thing raw is one guy singing.  They're a loud Metallica.  It's like a raw White Stripes is two people. 
[02:59:00]  Right.  Jesus.  It's a guitar and a drum.  Yeah.  My goodness.  What is it?  It's a one-man band?  Like, fuck it.  He has the fucking drums on his knees.  That's because between that and Wolf Mother, they're really good.  You know what would be really cool?  How about getting us White Stripes or Wolf Mother?  Well, Wolf Mother was something.  Somebody else intervened.  But now we're getting them November.  Who intervened?  It's a whole long story.  Oh, boy.  No, no.  We got to open up that can of worms and just let it sit there. 
[02:59:30]  No, just like they were going to come in, but then they're labeled.  The whole scheduling got messed up.  No, no, no.  But they're coming November.  That's not it now.  No, we know now.  We see two people like you.  We're good.  What happened?  Who intervened?  What happened?  Talk to us.  I don't know.  It was an ashy elbows.  Who?  We could read your mind.  I don't know.  No, they're coming in November.  I'll read your mind.  Yeah, what happened?  Who cock-blocked us?  Who did it?  Who did it?  Who cock-blocked us?  Who did it?  Who cock-blocked us?  I don't know.  That someone did it.  Who did it?  Who cock-blocked us?  I mean, even in the end.  Person or entity?  Person or entity?  I don't know. 
[03:00:00]  No, basically, I got a call back and they said-  Organization?  I don't know.  Who was it?  I got the-  Someone cock-blocked.  The skim of the skim.  I didn't get that much-  Skim of the skim.  Nothing really.  But enough.  You got enough where you understand what happened.  What happened?  Oh, no.  Tell us the skim of the skim, then.  Oh, no.  Just that they were going to come in, but the label, because of terrestrial,  and that, they're going to have to reschedule some stuff around.  What?  What are you going to say?  Wow.  Terrestrial and paddling.  He's doing 1,000 miles an hour on his bicycle. 
[03:00:30]  Backwards.  Now, who-  Terrestrial and this?  What's that mean?  No, they were doing scheduling, and the scheduling didn't work out, but when they're  back here in November-  Yeah.  They had a list there.  It said, hmm, biggest radio show in America at the moment.  Yeah.  November.  We'll push it back.  Yeah, that's odd, isn't it?  Well, no.  I mean-  Like terrestrial.  No, it was different than the game world.  Are you serious?  No.  It's different than the game world.  It's different than the game world.  What are you talking about?  Laszlo, you live in a game world.  You live in a fantasy world. 
[03:01:00]  Wait.  That was known.  You've just been pwned by-  I fucking ruined pwned you.  I'm going to log off and go home.  Goddamn log off.  Holy shit.  Now, explain to me why, when they've got like 25 terrestrial affiliates and simulcast  on XM.  It sounds easier.  It sounds-  Explain it in maybe like a XO kind of like button.  Laszlo, it's got nothing to do with a graphics card.  Shut up. 
[03:01:30]  No.  There's-  Wow.  Yes?  The politics.  Politics.  Entertainment.  All right, we're getting somewhere.  Politics.  Yeah.  So politics involves something.  Like Laszlo said, I'm not going to pat us on the back here.  I appreciate the compliment.  But when it comes to terrestrial morning radio, we're pretty much the top of the pyramid right  now.  Just about.  We're the top of the pyramid.  So where would they want to go other than our show that would prevent them from doing  our show tomorrow? 
[03:02:00]  You know, and don't say it because you're off tomorrow.  I mean, you know, figuratively speaking.  Yeah.  ASAP.  Who were they worried about pissing off as they just pissed us off and we reached 25  radio stations?  There you go, O.B.  I mean, hello.  Hello.  Like the other ones with like the other affiliates, like they're afraid that Dallas, the other  morning show, would not play their album.  Even if you hear it from San Francisco.  Why didn't they do our show first?  Well, why can't they go back and tell them? 
[03:02:30]  Because we're the fucking kings of the shithole now.  That's what I tell them.  And, you know, when you become king of the shithole and you're not just in one market,  then you get the guest, you know, first or the scheduler.  See, the scheduling should be top of the pyramid first and then trickle down.  If you want only five people to listen to your album, go ahead, do the other show.  If you want to hear more people, millions.  So at this point.  Did you sound that authoritative when you said it?  I did.  I was angry, yeah.  Ice cream, yes.  And what show?  What? 
[03:03:00]  Yeah, what show was it?  They didn't tell me.  It was some Dallas douche show.  Some guy, Billy Bob and something.  I forgot the guy's name.  Billy Bob in Dallas.  I don't know.  They cocked him.  Get a phone book.  We'll find him.  Hey, listen.  What I'm getting from Roland today.  We're not going to get White Stripes.  We're not going to get Wolf Mother.  We're going to just get like shit bands.  No.  That have nothing to lose.  Wait.  No.  No, we're going to get the Wolf Mother.  Give me the CD.  Let me look at it.  Track 2 is really good.  I'm not writing for Track 2.  Oh, sorry. 
[03:03:30]  I'm curious about Track 2.  Yeah, but I got to tell you, he's piquing my curiosity about Track 2.  All right.  What else do you know about the band?  About Track 2.  They're from Los Angeles.  All right.  They're from Los Angeles.  L.A.  Bass Band.  Must have hated Track 2.  Their fans started a campaign, how they got famous through blogging.  And went to MySpace and they blew up.  They're like one of the hits of South by Southwest.  Music Expo. 
[03:04:00]  What's the song you want us to play?  High and Dry.  What?  It's on the Frank cover.  It's on the what?  The Frank cover is a track list.  The Frank cover?  Front.  The what cover?  Front.  The cover?  Didn't he say Frank cover?  Yes, he did.  You said Frank cover.  Yes, he did.  Found the Frank cover.  Say it again.  The Frank cover.  Say it again.  Front cover?  Yeah, Frank.  But he said Frank.  Frank.  The Frank.  The Frank.  It's the back and the Frank.  Frank.  Say front.  Front.  Say Frank.  Frank.  Wow.  Where's your accent from? 
[03:04:30]  Impediment USA?  Hang Me Up to Dry?  Yes.  Track 2?  Yes.  Cold War Kids?  Yes.  Name of the album is Robbers and Cowards.  Raw by Spence.  I don't like it.  It's hokey and it's fucking boring.  Two notes out.  Careless in our summer clothes 
[03:05:00]  Splashing around in the muck and the mire  Careless in our summer clothes  Splashing around in the muck and the mire  Fell asleep with stains 
[03:05:30]  Caked deep in knees  What a thing  Now hang me up to dry  You bring me out too, too, too many times  Now hang me up to dry  I pray like the white will wipe up your eyes 
[03:06:00]  Want to hear more?  What's up, man?  I don't mind the, you know  When you're singing  I don't like that little Chinese part 
[03:06:30]  What's going on, man?  All mixed up in the wash  Hot water  Bleeding our colors  All mixed up in the wash  Hot water  Bleeding our colors  Now hang me up to dry  You bring me out too, too, too many times 
[03:07:00]  Now hang me up to dry  I don't mind her  I pray like the white will wipe up your eyes  I don't mind her 
[03:07:30]  Now hang me up to dry  You rang me out  Too, too, too many times  Now hang me up to dry  I party like the white 
[03:08:00]  With whites of your eyes  Now hang me up to dry  You rang me out  Too, too, too many times  Now hang me up to dry  I party like the white  With whites of your eyes  I hate it.  What's with that little sound in there 
[03:08:30]  and the piano?  Like, bang, bang, bang.  I like to get turned on to new music.  I hate it.  I don't hate it, but...  That wasn't bad.  He's singing about laundry.  I give it a triangle-triangle-square-X  Oh, yeah.  I don't like the fact that the beginning  is just Muck and Meyer twice.  Yeah, Muck and Meyer is a little...  It's the beginning, a little long  and then when he brings it on home  it's pretty cool.  But then when he's not singing  you know, when he goes up  kicks it up there  But when you're not conforming musically  it's really like... 
[03:09:00]  It's just...  That piano going  bang, bang, bang, bang  at one point is ridiculous.  It's like a retarded child  right in the room  and banged on him for a while  and split.  Yeah, fucking mongoloid  is in the band.  Look, I'm one guy.  What does the studio audience think?  Be honest.  Thumbs up, thumbs down.  A lot of eh, eh  we got a thumb up  we got a thumb down  and two eh, eh  a lot more...  A lot more liked it  on Pal Talk  than I've ever seen  like anything  that's been played in here.  Really?  Yeah, people that play  or play songs  they're like  this sucks, that sucks.  Because in life  they've all been hung out to dry. 
[03:09:30]  Hung out to dry.  I told you everyone  was going to do  the Wolf Mother sound.  I said that about  what, six months ago?  Six months ago?  That sound's been going on  for fucking...  No, but...  Five years.  No, I understand that.  Oh, well, yeah  the emo type.  I'm just...  The heavier like guitar  and stuff.  Yeah.  That, uh...  It's not bad  but there's nothing there  that makes it really  any more special  than what's going on  in the music scene.  Why do you have  such an affinity  for track two? 
[03:10:00]  Yeah.  That was their...  That's their new single.  Track two.  Oh, so they told you  to put that.  Oh, I didn't hear you.  No, that's the single  that you guys  might have heard  before, that's why.  What's the best song  in the city?  Food!  Yeah.  One of his things  about dryer sheets.  You would...  Yeah.  All right, let's go  to the phone.  Bounce that corner  off me!  Laundry-based songs.  Yeah.  Literally.  Hang me up, titra!  Plang, plang, plang!  Plang, plang!  That's what? 
[03:10:30]  You shot me  because of static clings!  This next one's about  when you accidentally  put a red shirt in  with, like, the whites.  I mean, it bleeds  in my heart.  Thank you.  One of the members  retarded, that's why  the plang, plang, plang.  Yeah, what was it?  That plang, plang, plang,  plang, plang, plang.  I don't know.  Well, let's go to the phones.  Shane.  Hey, good morning.  By the way,  don't let us influence you.  What do you think  of that song, Shane?  No, I nearly  threw my car,  well, crashed my car  over the Tappan Zee Bridge.  Oh, that would be extreme.  Yeah, that would have been good.  That would have sucked 
[03:11:00]  because I would have  missed the party tonight.  And, uh,  Jimmy, happy birthday.  Thank you, sir.  It's been overshadowed  because of Halloween.  You are bombing, sir.  Yeah, well...  Bombing horribly.  All right, well,  that's actually  an autistic family  and the singer  is getting raped  by the homemade.  Wow.  He said nothing.  That made me laugh.  Bombs away.  Let's go to Queensbury.  Good job, sir.  Let's say hi to Matt.  That was shocking.  Hey, guys.  Hey, Jimmy,  I just wanted to know  how much did they pay you  for doing that piano part  on that song? 
[03:11:30]  Hey, there you go.  That's how you...  They paid me $25.  Brad and PA.  Okay.  Worst fucking song  I've ever heard.  Yeah.  Did you like the line  about Muck and Meyer, Brad?  Yeah.  Is it the worst song  you ever heard?  Brad?  It's pretty close.  Thanks a lot, Brad.  Well,  we had a nice piss, Arnold.  What does everyone think?  I don't...  It's not my style.  I'm a bad judge.  Like, it's not my style, 
[03:12:00]  so I can't really tell.  I didn't like the...  I didn't...  I disliked it more  than I liked it,  but I didn't hate it,  so I wouldn't say no.  I don't really care  that much either way.  I opposite of you.  You liked it a little more  than you hated it.  I liked it a little more  than I hated it,  but there were parts in it  that I really hated,  but some of the parts  are pretty cool.  Is it just one guy?  No, it's a band.  Okay.  What is Pal Talk saying?  Pal Talk is saying  they liked it,  and then people said  it sucked.  Well, Roland wants them 
[03:12:30]  to come in this Friday.  This Friday morning.  Yes.  Friday, let's see.  And Greg Giraldo  wants to come in also.  This isn't bad.  I like it.  This sucks.  It's good, actually.  I like it.  Me too.  Me too.  B-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b.  Kind of modest mousish.  Wolf mother.  Song sucks balls. 
[03:13:00]  And it sounds like  everything else today.  I don't think it sounds  like everything else today.  It's kind of mixed.  I'll give them that much.  Sounds a bit different.  It's got a little bit  of a sound of what's going on.  I think.  Oh, Jimmy, did you do it again?  Unfortunately, I'll be gone Friday, so I don't have an opinion either way.  But if you don't like it that much, you're right.  That's all on it.  Let's sit on it for a day and see what happens.  Jimmy sits on it a day and fucking disintegrates the CD. 
[03:13:30]  I like the chorus.  I like the chorus.  Turn me up to dry.  Right.  Enough about the spam.  Let's move on.  Enough about the laundry.  Just a little fabric softener.  Let's move on to Mike Woods.  Yes, that's what I want to hear.  Do you have other copies?  I'll get another one.  Jimmy, legally now, legally you have to leave this studio.  He just threw the CD rolling as he walked out. 
[03:14:00]  Threw it right at him.  Whoa.  Where did we get Paul R. Nelson stuff?  Danny?  I contacted them for a lawn sign, and they sent a ton of stuff.  Wow, look at a lawn sign.  He's running in Wisconsin.  Did you say Paul R. Nelson?  I certainly did.  You did not say Paul R. Nelson.  Give me an extra large shirt. 
[03:14:30]  You might be right about now.  Yeah.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  Check it out now.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  Right about now.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  Check it out now.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  I'm Paul R. Nelson  Check it out now  I'm Paul R. Nelson  Right about now  Paul R. Nelson  Thank God almighty  Paul R. Nelson

[03:15:30]  In Dallas, Texas  Paul R. Nelson  Is dead  Paul R. Nelson  Tear down that wall  Right about now  Paul R. Nelson  Right about now  I'm Paul R. Nelson  Check it out now  I'm Paul R. Nelson  Right about now  I'm Paul R. Nelson  Check it out now  Paul R. Nelson  Check it out now  I'm Paul R. Nelson  Check it out now  I'm Paul R. Nelson 
[03:16:00]  Check it out now  I'm Paul R. Nelson  Check it out now  I'm Paul R. Nelson  Paul R. Nelson has left the building.  Yeah.  We better than that wash-on cold band or permanent press or whatever that shit was.  Yeah, permanent press.  There was also a note that came with the package.  It says, Opie and Anthony, thanks for talking about us on your show.  You crashed our website, and it signed, thanks, Paul R. Nelson. 
[03:16:30]  Wow, let me see.  Wow.  We got an autograph from Paul R. Nelson.  That is an actual autograph.  And it is written from Paul R. Nelson.  We have a new pal in politics.  Can I point out that you're excited that a real estate agent sent you a note?  But it's Paul R. Nelson.  Do we like Paul R. Nelson now?  How can you not like him?  Now we do.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  Yes, he is.  You know why he lifts?  Does he get a little gap in the old teeth?  Oh, yes. 
[03:17:00]  You crashed our show website.  We got campaign signs and T-shirts and stickers.  All the people out there.  I want to tell you a story of a person I read a letter from online today named Old Gravy Leg.  Like, he has problems.  Goes into one of those speeches about hope.  You know, the hope of people like little Connor Peterson. 
[03:17:30]  Or Frederica Bimmel.  The woman who's a size 14.  Size.  By the way, everyone wants us to book the Paul R. Nelson megamix band instead of that other crap.  That is a great song.  You know what happened with Roland, by the way?  He played all his cards.  He admitted openly that bands that we really would want on the show are too scared to come on the show.  So now we're only going to be offered bands that are, you know, they don't want to alienate themselves. 
[03:18:00]  We're now in that category where other stations and other shows are saying, well, if you do that show, then we're not going to play your record.  Music stations have that edge over talk stations a lot of times.  And they say, you know, they're not the one playing your record.  Yeah, well, here's the X Factor.  Yes.  We have XM, which fucking has a lot of fucking people listening to it on these big stations.  And if XM works with us and helps us cock block that type of thingy, all right, you want the one station in Dallas, which, first of all, will play you anyway, you fucking dummies. 
[03:18:30]  Yeah, guaranteed they're going to play it.  With the song, it gets popular.  It's in their best interest.  What else are they going to play?  Are they going to play, like, just homegrown bands because they're going to have a problem with all these bands?  Say Shakira fucking pissed off the station.  Yeah.  Would they not play her on it?  She's the one of the hottest artists in the country.  Of course they're going to play her.  We've got to make a statement to the record labels.  We ain't playing their game.  And we can XM.  They're not going to give us just the bands that really need the help and they have nothing to lose. 
[03:19:00]  Right.  We need some quality bands on the Opie and Anthony show.  If XM will fucking, because if they're fucking the show, they're fucking XM.  And if XM will kind of back it up and go, all right, well, we'll play that game too.  And that's exposure all over the country and Canada.  You won't be getting it.  One station somewhere.  Which A is lying and we'll play it anyway because they need people to listen for ratings.  And here's the reality of terrestrial rock radio.  It's dying.  I mean, look at New York and Philly.  Yep.  No new rock station in either market anymore.  No.  And it's happening in markets nationwide. 
[03:19:30]  Terrestrial rock stations are dying because the record labels don't focus on new bands anymore.  They're all focusing on hip-hop acts.  Yeah.  You don't see any new rock stations popping up.  New York City has no new rock station.  New rock station.  Dude, I walked into FH Riley's on Saturday after the Islanders game.  FH Riley's in Huntington?  Thank you, Anthony.  Is that on New York Avenue?  400 New York Avenue.  Yes, Jimmy.  Have you been there before?  And actually, I walked in the back door late after the Islanders game, wanted to have  a quiet freaking dinner. 
[03:20:00]  And my brother booked this band.  I guess they were a wedding band for this wedding where it was a Halloween wedding.  Like, everyone had dressed in Halloween costume.  Oh, boy.  And they needed a place to go after the reception was over because they still wanted a party.  So my brother said, yeah, you could rock FH Riley's for an hour or two hours.  This band was so freaking cool.  Really?  They were called the Mathematicians or something like that?  Someone's got to help me out and get me some stuff.  I've got to play it on our show.  Cool wedding Halloween band? 
[03:20:30]  It was a rap, metal...  I don't know what it was, to be honest with you.  I can't really throw it in a particular genre.  But I think it's a local band in Long Island.  If someone could help me out, tell them to send stuff in.  I want to play it on the radio.  Because I heard some noises coming from these guys that I've never heard before.  And it was so freaking loud that they, you know, everyone went fleeing.  But it was a good time.  Yeah, those bands like the volume, even in the small places.  I was reminded by that because you said rap.  Because it had like a rap, rock.  It was all over the place. 
[03:21:00]  But it kind of worked.  I want to give them a plug and play some of their stuff on the show.  Rock.  We get rolling?  No, Sam's looking for him.  Oh, okay.  I'm looking for him.  Because I want to know...  Oh, here he is.  Roland never flees.  Roland's like the Marine Corps.  The colors don't run.  These colors don't run.  They say they got a sample of their music on there.  Roland, I got a question.  Before...  What label is this band from?  I forgot the name of them already.  What's the name of the band?  They're called Cold War Kids. 
[03:21:30]  Cold War Kits.  Yeah, kids.  I don't know the label.  Cold War Kits.  All right.  Kits or...  Kits.  It's downtown music.  All right.  Who else?  Is that a subsidiary of...  Well, they also did the Wreck-ing Tours.  Oh.  Hmm.  Wow.  Really?  Yeah.  Is it an indie label or a subsidiary of a major label?  I think it's a subsidiary of V2.  Downtown.  Like V2 is the same thing. 
[03:22:00]  Okay.  Right.  Yeah.  All right.  She was...  I believe it's, I guess, a subsidiary of V2 Records.  A what?  V2.  Say what you said again.  Subsidiary?  Why do you always get it right the second time?  Close.  That's really frustrating.  Oh, he didn't.  A subsidiary?  Oh, it was close enough for me.  It was off by nine letters.  It was close enough for me.  I was like, all right.  Say it again.  A subsidiary?  Oh, yeah.  Of course.  A subsidiary.  Yeah.  Say it again.  Roland, we have to make a statement. 
[03:22:30]  Okay.  We have to pass.  All right.  Yeah.  Until these record labels start, like, bringing real players to the show, we love helping out  bands on the way up.  Absolutely.  And we probably should have these guys on Friday, but I don't want to be cockblocked anymore,  so we've got to make a statement.  And this band has to be collateral damage.  Yeah.  You want us to help out the up-and-coming bands?  We also need some big players in the music industry.  We're all music fans on this show.  And because they're going to cockblock because of the fucking local stations, the bottom 
[03:23:00]  line is we have XM here, which probably has more listeners than any fucking single local  station.  Yeah.  Well, it's a whole different other stuff, too.  It's just not that.  It's just like other...  Like what?  I don't know.  What?  Go ahead.  You got it.  You look so defeated.  What is it?  That's just the way it looks.  Yeah.  He looks like that even when he's celebrating a big victory.  Yeah.  We won that.  Go ahead.  What is it?  What's the real crock?  This was something he threw at us.  What's the real issue?  I don't know.  Just the whole...  It's kind of like when you get like a guest. 
[03:23:30]  Yeah.  And then they come in and then...  They come in.  Well, it's just like...  You're a horrid fabricator.  I know.  I'm trying to think.  I don't know.  Wow.  Why can't we get...  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  See, be inspired by someone like this.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  Look, he's getting things done.  He's a go-getter.  All right.  We're going to pass.  Roland.  Okay.  So what's the real problem? 
[03:24:00]  And you can tell them why.  We're not happy with, you know, bands not coming on the show.  Every band has an excuse.  Every band.  I love Wolf Mother.  Yeah, I know.  They should be doing our show.  Absolutely.  I know because you guys play the music in and out of commercials, too.  Yeah, yeah.  All right.  We've got to get into Mike Woods and Mark Joyella.  Mark Joyella.  There goes Roland.  I've never seen somebody so happy to put headphones down on a table.  Oh, I know.  Oh, yeah.  He is out. 
[03:24:30]  That's great.  He'd rather wear two severed dicks on his ears than headphones.  All right.  Here's the deal.  Mike Woods and Mark Joyella of Fox 5 Morning News.  They dressed up this morning.  Of course they did.  As the skipper and Gilligan.  Because it's the news.  Why shouldn't they dress up as goofy fucking characters from a 40-year-old sitcom?  Skipper and Gilligan.  You think Cronkite turns on the news and just goes, what the fuck?  Yeah.  What the fuck?  What the fuck?  Well, they had to do some bad improv in their costumes. 
[03:25:00]  Please tell me he'd call him Little Buddy.  Oh, that'd be great.  Or, I don't know.  Who did he play?  Who did he play?  I don't know.  He was the skipper?  Hmm.  Wait, the black guy was the skipper?  Oh, that's...  All right, so he's the skipper, and then she was Gilligan?  He.  He?  Whichever.  Well, there is a she in that team, so we can figure it out.  All right, here we go.  All right.  Ah, time now for Weather Authority, Jonas Grimsby.  You know, that's really his name they mentioned in the pilot. 
[03:25:30]  And Gilligan.  My little buddy.  How you doing out there, Gilligan?  Hey, skipper.  Hey, what's going on?  Give me some coffee while you're out there.  How about?  It's been a long time.  My goodness.  How's the weather out there?  It's okay.  Yeah?  I think we can get off this island.  Has anybody been laughing at you, by chance?  Because we are.  Only my agent told me it was all over.  Oh, really?  Yes.  I'm finished.  What do you think the chances are that we're going to get rescued? 
[03:26:00]  I think our producer just rescued us and said, move along the weather.  Okay.  We'll see you, little buddy.  Get out of there.  I tell you.  54 degrees.  And we're talking about some sunshine around the Tri-State area.  Is anyone going to take me seriously from this point forward?  It doesn't really matter.  43 degrees right now out in Caldwell.  Yes, they will take you seriously.  It's the only way to take you because you're devoid of humor.  Okay.  Terrific.  Holy. 
[03:26:30]  Unbelievably uncomfortable to listen to that.  That is the sound of democracy dying.  If that is what our fucking news is in this country.  You expect that in, like, Turkey or some shit.  Oh, my God.  Or those wacky Spanish shows where they wear all these neon-colored frills.  That was so bad.  That banter between them was one guy was trying to stay in the character, 
[03:27:00]  and the other guy was trying to realize, like, convey how embarrassing it is to be in the costume.  And neither of them had anything funny or worth saying.  And the one guy goes, give me some coffee.  Like, I don't know, are you fucking the skipper or Jake LaMotta?  Yeah, what was that?  Get me some coffee.  You fuck Marianne.  You fuck Marianne.  Go ahead.  Kill Mrs. Howell.  Kill Sally.  Kill me.  Thurston, Thurston, your fucking mother, Thurston. 
[03:27:30]  Gilligan, you're going to find your hat dead in the hallway.  I got to go make some stew.  Oh, no.  I want to come in there.  Here's what I want to do.  Oh, no.  While you're on the toilet, I'm going to kneel by you and rub your belly in the small of your back and help it come out.  Grab a wireless.  We got to hear it.  We got to hear it.  There's nothing better.  It is so funny to hear.  I don't know if I got anything.  But you got to try. 
[03:28:00]  Try.  Grab the wireless.  Somebody get OP headphones and a mic before he shits his fucking pants.  And put it right there in the bowl to get maximum echo-ness.  The inside of his underwear is going to look like...  Is that on?  No.  Why would it be?  Turn it on.  Turn it on and there's a switch on the bottom.  There we go.  If he doesn't get there soon, the inside of his underwear is going to look like Al Yegani's Crock-Pot.  No poop for you.  Does it work?  I don't hear him.  OP. 
[03:28:30]  Yeah.  Oh, there you go.  I hear you now.  Give OP some headphones, too.  He's got them.  He's got them.  Get the boss headphones, Crock-Pot.  OP's working his way into the bathroom.  Please.  I don't know if this is going to work.  Yeah, well...  Well, we'll try.  We'll keep it low, sort of like a golf announcing type thing, just in case the action starts.  We don't want to be stepping on it.  This is talking low.  This way we can hear it start and back off.  Poe, get out of here.  Why does Poe have to be in the bathroom with me?  I like to smell it. 
[03:29:00]  I want to wrestle it.  I like to guess what you had to eat by the smell, gentlemen.  Nice low, gentlemen.  And, OP, if you feel it coming on, prepare everybody and just say, here it comes.  So we can stop talking.  Or say open wide.  We'll just know to be quiet.  What?  Oh, he's unbuckling.  Just let us know.  Oh, jeez.  Okay.  Shh, shh, shh.  Let's listen.  Just mud. 
[03:29:30]  Let's listen.  No, that was it.  That was it?  That's all I got.  No, you got more.  Come on.  One more.  No, it's...  Dude, that was just one...  It's like a soft serve right now, trust me, but...  Oh, jeez.  You don't get much splash out of that.  Oh, jeez.  It's just kind of like a mud slide.  What, did you just have like a gas plug holding it in?  And then it just went.  It just went and there's no more gas?  The body wanted to empty and there was air in there just going, please get us to a bathroom.  The levee broke. 
[03:30:00]  All right, that's about it.  That's it.  Okay, well...  Oh, wait.  Oh.  I was just kidding.  You suck.  So we had another one.  When Jimmy goes in there, it's a cavalcade.  How good was that one day?  The variety show of farts and shit and piss.  The best was when I interviewed Freddie...  Fucking girl, Freddie Garcia.  I was on the toilet interviewing him and shitting.  Oh, yeah.  And we had Bob Kelly who threw up and he heard me shitting.  Yeah, Bob Kelly. 
[03:30:30]  Weak stomach Bob Kelly couldn't take the sound of Jimmy shitting.  My stomach.  I fucking...  I had like an African monkey disease.  I couldn't stop shitting.  Oh, it was horrid.  Oh, you got to warn us.  There's a little more.  I didn't warn myself.  He had his pants up.  I'm already in the hall.  I got to go back.  Nice racing stripe down the back of the thigh.  What was that?  Disgusting.  Holy God. 
[03:31:00]  I'll clean it up, gentlemen.  Don't worry.  I'll do it with one piece of tissue paper.  It's economical.  I'll sacrifice my fingernails.  I think that's it.  Is that it?  You are.  You're still in the bowl, right?  You got to relax.  Just let it all hang out.  Yeah.  Yeah.  There's nothing...  Wow.  We're going to pop something. 
[03:31:30]  Labor.  Fuck.  There's nothing funnier than the sounds of fucking shit.  It's the toilet bowl that gives that resonance.  Wonderful echo.  That's a good sign.  It could not be replicated.  This could be the first solid in 16 hours.  Is this...  I want to hear the point.  Jesus Christ.  If anything comes out, you're going to have to take it to the Halloween party with you.  I want to hear that plunk.  You ever drop one hard pellet and it has that awful lonely plunk into the toilet? 
[03:32:00]  Bloop.  Like a milk dud.  I hate those.  Yeah.  Open your ass.  Open your ass.  Oh, do you want me to come in there and rub your tummy and back?  Are you in here?  Do you want me to...  Well, maybe.  Where are you, you ass?  Do you want me to come in there?  I can hear the echo.  Do you want me to come in there?  He's hitting the stomach.  He's patting himself.  Do you want me to come in there and rub your small ear back in your belly? 
[03:32:30]  No.  You know who could help you?  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  Did you say Paul R. Nelson?  Yeah.  Hit CD one.  Somebody do it.  Oh, nice.  Oh, I swear to God, I thought that was him.  There's something cooking in my oven.  That's a great sound, isn't it? 
[03:33:00]  I think that's all you're getting today.  Yeah.  Well, hold on.  Give it a second.  What are you doing in here?  Yeah.  What is he doing?  He's in the studio.  No, he's not.  I'm not stupid.  Jimmy.  What is he doing?  I'm looking under the stall.  He is in the studio.  Sweetie.  You finished?  You're right there.  All right.  Why do you got cooking in your oven over here?  I'm in the studio.  Yeah, that's obvious.  As I see your awful sneakers you bought from Nike Town. 
[03:33:30]  Hey.  Oh, that's fucking...  Hey, old.  Yeah.  Um...  It smells kind of bad in here.  Yeah.  No, no, not there.  Oh, fuck.  If you're not going to deliver, I will.  Oh, shit.  I delivered a little.  Jimmy's parts have been horrific today.  No, they haven't been.  Oh, real bad.  Is Ann in here, too? 
[03:34:00]  No.  Where are you?  Okay, yes, I am.  You're both in here?  We're all in the bathroom with you.  No, you're not.  You're alone in there.  Look, I'll knock on the stall.  Fucking asshole.  Did you hear it in your headphones?  Are you feeling better?  Is it emptying?  No.  Or you've still got blockage?  There's another blockage.  I don't like the ones that, like, the first part of it, you know, part one is great, and  then part two is like a fucking chore. 
[03:34:30]  Well.  Got to kind of...  I know.  I'm at the chore stage.  Or when you have to...  The worst is when it comes out halfway and decides, I'm stopping right here.  Yeah, then you gotta wipe it.  Stop right there.  Four hours to wipe it.  Yeah, you gotta break it.  You gotta finally make the commitment and go, you know, I can't hold my ass open this  much longer.  You got a pinch?  I just got a pinch.  It's that real oily black stuff.  Oily black.  Yeah.  You've been, like, drinking Guinness and eating chili. 
[03:35:00]  You got any more, Oop?  Are you in here now?  Huh?  Yeah, that's you.  I can see.  Dude, whose shoes were those?  I don't know.  Vance?  Danny's?  Right now, the bowl I'm looking into, I'm looking into a toilet, and there's one piece.  It looks like a little frosted mini-wheat floating.  It's like a fleck.  Is Jimmy going in there to...  Listen, here I am.  Listen.  All right.  All right. 
[03:35:30]  Let's listen.  Because you know it's coming after this.  Oh, no, I'm just whizzing.  Oh, I thought you were sitting on the bowl.  No, no, I'm peeing.  Don't you have to take a shit?  No.  You were farting like crazy.  There's got to be something up there.  There is, but I wouldn't fucking...  I wouldn't wreck that scent, because right now, I got gas.  It's got to go by logs, and it fucking reeks because of that.  Come on, take a shit.  I can.  I don't have to.  I love your shits, Jimmy.  I know.  Me too.  Get in line.  Get in line.  Get in line.  Such a nice echo. 
[03:36:00]  Yeah, no, I don't...  I don't have to take a dump.  It's such a shame.  You're ruining the show.  I drank a smoothie, but it'll probably take a little while for it to take effect.  Like, I won't have to go for a little while.  Yeah, for a while.  What a shock the big bands won't come on the show.  Yeah, why aren't these big bands coming on this program?  Like I said, top of the pyramid.  I wish you didn't see me.  I was going to start...  I wanted to whiz under the thing. 
[03:36:30]  That's what he does sometimes.  He was getting dressed already by the time I came in there.  All right.  Because I like taking a leak in the stall, like at home.  I like pissing in a toilet.  Uh, and if I'm taking a leak, Jimmy will get in the stall next to me and start pissing  in the toilet, but then he'll fucking start pissing under the divider, and there's a whole  puddle of piss splashing at me.  Do you know what I like to do, too?  If I'm taking a shit in a stall, this is someone I know.  Just ease my foot under the door, under the stall.  Just, so when you're shitting, you see half of my shoe in your, in your stall. 
[03:37:00]  It's such an invasion of space, you know?  You know, it's almost like the shoe is a face looking up at you.  Wait, when you're in that stall, that is your fucking private space.  And then it's someone's foot to come under the...  Five little piggies.  One wants roast beef.  A lot of people are saying it's your turn, Anthony.  No, I don't have to take a shit.  All right.  I took...  Let me tell you something.  I went to the doctor yesterday, and it was my yearly exam. 
[03:37:30]  Can I set this up by saying that I heard the story already?  Yeah, yeah.  Anthony called me yesterday, and I decided to put him on speaker, because I just put all  my phones on speaker for him at this point.  Yeah, why not?  It's easier, because you can continue doing what you're doing.  Why not?  And the lovely Lindsay was on the couch with me and got to hear what you're about to say.  That's fine.  I don't even, I don't even care.  You were embarrassed at the time.  Lindsay's a saint.  Yeah.  She can hear stuff like that.  That's fine.  I went to the doctor for my yearly physical, and I dread this every fall. 
[03:38:00]  I think about the day after the exam, I start dreading the next one a year later, because  last year was the first year I got the prostate exam.  Never got it in my life.  I have never had anything go the other way up my ass in my whole life.  And now you're hooked.  You can't come without us. 
[03:38:30]  Poor girlfriend.  She's ruined me.  She started with one finger, and now she's got to get someone else to put it in their hand,  too.  I got three in a month.  I went in.  I went in.  Wait, three fingers in one month?  I went in with the flu, and he did that.  The flu.  I already know.  That's why I haven't been back to my doctor.  I've got to find a new doctor, because there's something creepy going on with this guy.  I got the one, and then I got the second time.  The second.  And then the third time.  I'm like, all right, what are you doing?  Hey, what are you doing here?  What's up here? 
[03:39:00]  I've got a full reason for this.  He's on the chat boards, the doctor chat boards.  My finger up, Opie's ass.  Hey, dude, I got him three times.  Yeah, the doctors are all laughing with each other.  How many times?  I bet I get this guy five.  Five in a year.  He had a stink finger, because he wanted to smear it on a fucking slide.  They do.  You're doing it in a pap smear?  What were you doing?  No, they do things where they slide your duty on a.  He puts it on something that almost looks like an open matchbook, and he puts it on both  sides.  Like, he does, after he has his finger in your ass, he then wipes it on this matchbook-looking 
[03:39:30]  thing, and then takes an eyedropper and drops one drop on each side, looks at it  for a couple of seconds, and then either throws it away or goes, oh my God, we're going to  rip your colon out.  It's, you know, to check for blood or something.  Did I tell you, he sticks the finger up my ass, right?  And he's got this smelly finger up in the air like this, and now he's trying to get out  of the examining room, and his lab coat gets caught on the door, and now he's stuck with  his finger up in the air.  Well, why the fuck did he, oh, he had to get to the thing? 
[03:40:00]  One finger pointing, like he's about to make a proclamation.  And I have shit on my finger!  And how he was stuck, he couldn't get the door with his left hand, so now he's like,  he's struggling to try to get out of the exam room with the stink finger up in the air,  and I had to, like, open the door for the guy.  Aren't there devices he could stick up your ass?  You know who that was?  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  Did you say Paul R.?  Anyway, go ahead, sorry, and I'm jumping on your story.  Well, it had a common thread, a finger up the ass.  A hard on, oh. 
[03:40:30]  Yeah, boner.  It was the yearly exam, so I had to get the finger.  And it is just, and they save it for last.  They save it for fucking last.  And it goes through everything else, EKG, they take the chest x-ray, and everything,  they take your blood, blood pressure, all that fun stuff, and then you just know it's  coming.  And he goes, all right, go in there and take your pants off.  Oh, it's the worst.  So you're just standing in the waiting room in nothing but your underwear. 
[03:41:00]  And then he steps up to the little counter that's next to the little seat bed thing you  got to sit on with the butcher's paper on it.  And he goes, okay, stand up, and he goes, lean over the table, make an L out of yourself.  Like, okay, so, you know, you bend at the waist and kind of lean your elbows on the butcher  paper that's on there.  And you just hear the glove going on.  You hear that latex sound, the snapping. 
[03:41:30]  And what the fuck?  I'm very far from okay.  Yeah, you okay, Anthony?  No, man.  I'm pretty fucking far from okay.  It's called the glack test.  The glack test?  Thank you, Christian.  That's because the sound comes out of your mouth when that finger goes in your ass.  Glack.  Glack.  Glack.  Same sound the finger makes coming out of your ass.  Glack.  No, it makes a fruit. 
[03:42:00]  When you pull the finger out, it makes a fruit roll-up sound.  Turn that music down just for one second.  It goes like this.  Oh, Jimmy.  No.  That's the sound it makes when it comes out of your ass.  Maybe your ass.  Mine just goes, you can't hear because it's overshadowed by, ow!  So he puts the lube on.  Yeah.  He like a lot of, I guess it's KY.  Yes.  And a tube.  And just fucking lubes up his finger and goes right to town. 
[03:42:30]  Whammo!  It isn't slow.  It isn't like, you know, maybe I'll help this guy out a little bit by doing it slow.  He doesn't want it to be sexy.  No.  It is.  He jams that finger in your ass.  Yeah.  And then starts like moving it around.  He's feeling for fucking, you know, shit in there or, you know, prostate stuff.  And then just pulls it right out of your ass and wipes it on the little card, the drops. 
[03:43:00]  Now you're standing there and, and I swear to you, I, I bit my thumb.  I, I, I was leaning on my elbows with like my thumb in my teeth.  And the second his finger got jammed in my ass, I bit down on my thumb until it bled.  I am so fucking heterosexual, ladies and gentlemen.  No, you're not.  Were you embarrassed right after you were done when you had to ask for a napkin because you came on your leg?  Oh, my. 
[03:43:30]  I got to break in.  Paul R. Nelson.  Paul R. Nelson's on MSNBC.  Quick.  Pot it up.  Pot it up immediately.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  Speaking of fingers up your ass.  Don't you think that that's appropriate if children are in the room and they hear particularly that he voted to spend it on sex?  You also talk about masturbation in the ad.  Is that the kind of thing that, that you really think that children should hear?  That we've been playing.  Nora, it's just like we talk about in the ad.  If wrong kind had better priorities, you wouldn't have to be hearing this.  I think the people of western Wisconsin and the people of the United States deserve to know how their representatives in Congress have been wasting their tax dollars 
[03:44:00]  and then have the gall to come and tell the American people that we need to pay more taxes and then we could balance the budget.  What specifically did Ron Kind vote for, which you say he voted instead to spend on sex?  Explain that.  Yeah, specifically, Nora, Ron Kind voted against something called the Toomey Amendment.  And the Toomey Amendment was to defund these ridiculous sex studies studying things like the two-spirited, transgendered Aleutian Eskimo. 
[03:44:30]  He voted against that amendment to defund these studies.  So, in essence, he voted to fund the exact studies that we are defining here.  And did the National RNC help you with the research to put together this ad?  No, absolutely not, Nora.  This was done privately, completely on our own.  And to those that look at this ad and say, gosh, the guy who ran an ad like that, 
[03:45:00]  rather than on the big issues like Iraq or health care or taxes, must be desperate.  Your response?  Well, yeah, Nora, we address all of those things in the ad.  We are talking about the fact that Mr. Kind didn't actually vote against a pay raise for our troops  while they're fighting and dying in the war on terror.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  These are the priorities that Paul R. Nelson has.  I think this is exactly what a congressional campaign should be about, 
[03:45:30]  the difference between the way the challenger would vote and the way the incumbent has.  Absolutely.  And we talk in the ad that instead of cancer research, wrong kind is voting for sex studies.  This is exactly what we're talking about in this ad, Nora.  All right, Republican Paul Nelson, thanks so much for joining us.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  Thank you, Nora.  And up next, we'll talk to a Democrat.  In fact, the Iraq war veteran.  Did you see him swallow after?  I know.  He was really nervous.  He was swallowing.  Phone call? 
[03:46:00]  Is that Paul R. Nelson?  Yes.  Yeah.  Oh, where was I?  Put his finger up my ass.  Pulled it out.  You're a milky moment.  And then he said, yeah.  He said, because I like, I bit my thumb and went like, Jesus Christ.  Like, right when he put his finger in there.  It was, it fucking is uncomfortably, like, painful.  It's not a fun thing to have done to your asshole. 
[03:46:30]  Well, Doug has a different opinion.  And Doug in Boston, go ahead.  Hey, Ed, I was wondering if you had your thumb in your mouth just so you could feel what it was like to be in the middle of a rotisserie.  Yo, God, second.  No.  Were they playing cards on your back?  Playing cards.  I was biting my finger.  Well, then why'd you paint your thumb black?  You asshole.  I was doing it to divert, see, to divert pain from one area, I will normally inflict my own measure of pain on another. 
[03:47:00]  If I have to get a needle, I'll usually pinch my leg.  Ew.  Because I can regulate that pain up to a point where you then don't feel the needle.  It's a common practice.  No, I know.  I just take the needle and shut my face.  Take the pain.  Yeah.  Well, anyway, I was biting my thumb and I was like, quite like the doctor knew this was not fun for me.  And then pulls his finger out.  And then he says, he goes, he goes, ah, you Italians never like that. 
[03:47:30]  And I kind of turned to him and he goes, he goes, you know, it's funny.  And I go, no, it isn't.  Like, I cut him off in mid, he's ready to say something.  He goes, you know, it's funny.  No, it isn't.  There is nothing funny about this.  He goes, ha, ha, ha, the Irish really don't seem to mind, they don't really mind.  He goes, but you Italians really don't like that.  You really put up a fight.  And then I'm thinking, what the fuck?  The Irish sitting there just going, yeah, duck, how about the fist? 
[03:48:00]  Anything.  I've had a few fucking Guinness.  Well, not just popping in there.  I didn't know it was racially.  Like, how do the blacks feel about it?  They must hate it.  Yeah, well, they're used to it from fucking getting pulled over.  The problem is the Irish, they're a little too weak to fight back because they're famine-stricken.  So they just kind of lay like fucking limp turnips on the fucking, he can just do whatever he wants.  And I just had this, I was like, can I clean up? 
[03:48:30]  It's like this whole thing, you instantly feel like a hooker or something or a bitch or a one-night stand thing.  Because then you're like, he's like, yeah, his back is turned, and I'm taking tissues and, like, wiping KY out of my ass crack.  And it's like, it's just like, this is it.  You're going to be wiping for days, my friend.  I go, this is it.  No, so then as I'm driving home, I'm thinking, oh, my God, please don't get into a car accident and die.  Because if my fucking mother has to hear, you know, Mrs. DeLeonardo, we really, we didn't really want to say this, but it's, you know, it's in the record here. 
[03:49:00]  He had KY jelly in his underwear and in his anus at the time of the accident.  And they'll pull the clip from the OnStar, because you probably called Opie on the OnStar, right?  They'll pull that audio clip that they recorded, just if you're going, and then he said, form an L.  Form an L, and it went in my ass. 
[03:49:30]  You'll be the best to do right before you go in for that test.  You take one of those shits we spoke about earlier that breaks off, and you couldn't wipe it if you had six hours to kill.  And then make him stick his finger out of that.  Well, he said that they do have people that come in pretty dirty, because I was in a big rush yesterday.  I rushed out of here, because I didn't go right to the doctor.  I went home to shower first.  It's a common courtesy, you know?  So I ran home, showered.  You went home to shower before you saw the guy who was going to put a finger in your ass? 
[03:50:00]  Why would you go to a full yearly examination where they're going to be, like, feeling under your arms for things?  Because you want to be in and out.  No, you want to be clean and not be a dirty guy that the doctor dreads working on.  You want to smell like a homeless guy.  You want to smell like a homeless guy.  Yeah, so he's in and out, like, oh, jeez, let's all get this over with.  He wasn't kissing me on the neck and fucking me.  He was in and out, believe me.  Well, he was kind of fucking you.  Yeah, well, he was.  He finger popped you.  It's awful.  Have you had that done, Jimmy? 
[03:50:30]  I think I have, but I requested it.  You requested it?  Cost you $100?  For a psychiatrist, I had it done.  Yeah, no, I, uh...  Running with dildos.  I did, actually.  I've had it done.  It's unpleasant.  It is so unpleasant.  Like, this is what you ought to do.  Right before he does it, you do this.  Like, when you're laying, they just go...  I'm sure they probably have many people that do.  I'm going to get my doctor back.  I'm going in there with explosive diarrhea.  Imagine.  I'm going to spray him next time. 
[03:51:00]  He puts his finger in there, and all along the sides of it, just comes out like icing,  like cake icing.  Let's go to Chad in Denver.  Chad.  Hey, boys.  Hey, Chad.  Hey.  I'm sure your doctor didn't say, you like that, don't you faggot?  No, he didn't say that.  Yeah, he did.  Sean in O-Town, bring it on, brother.  Bring it on, brother.  Hey, Ant.  When the doctor was done, did he throw a 20 on the table in five?  Yeah, I'm just wondering.  Yeah.  All right.  Hit the road.  A lot of questions.  Jeremy and Jersey. 
[03:51:30]  Cost me a $20 copay.  I had to pay.  Hey.  Pull out a 20.  Did Anthony bite his thumb because he forgot to bring his pillow?  Faggot!  What are they yelling?  Faggot!  Red in Boston.  Red.  Yo, I got the finger wave when I was, like, 25 because I was pissing blood when I was taking  a shit.  Oh, well, that might do something.  Jesus Christ, ah.  Hang on.  It gets worse.  So I go back, and the guy's like, hey, you're all set.  He's like, but the one final test we can do is take a camera, put a little numbing lube 
[03:52:00]  on it, go in my dick, and take a look at my bladder.  Holy shit.  He's like, you know what you want.  I was like, you know what, pal?  I think I'm good.  Yeah, you don't need that.  That would hurt.  No, no, no, no, no.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  The doctor then conveyed to me a cute little story about some young lad  of about nine or ten that had some kind of a problem going to the bathroom,  and he went to the doctor, and the doctor had to do the same thing.  He was telling you about finger blasting a young lad. 
[03:52:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He had to put a finger in there, and the kid, though, runs out after it's done  into the full waiting room and goes, he put a finger in my poopy.  It wasn't even at the doctor's office.  Guys, we got meat products.  Baby sitting.  We got meat products.  What?  From Ralphie May.  So did the fucking doctor and his fingernails after he got through with Anthony.  Throw a couple fillets in my backpack.  Piece of sausage, Link.  What are those? 
[03:53:00]  Please enjoy a very belated thanks for being so good to me, Ralphie May.  He gave his filet, he gave his boneless strip steak, bone and strip steak, and veal port.  Is it off of himself?  Veal porterhouse chops.  What a nice guy.  Thank you, Ralphie.  That is very generous of him.  He's a good boy, Ralphie.  Absolutely.  Wow.  You guys want to hear the mathematicians?  I'm scared.  What is it?  Oh, that's a band?  I'm trying to think how drunk I was when I heard these guys, because I might look really  sick.  Ah, nice.  You're learning from the boys, Opie.  Yeah.  You kind of pawned it off. 
[03:53:30]  I'm a little scared now.  On alcohol.  Yeah, blame Captain Morgan.  Right.  It's a band called Mathematicians.  They were at F.H. Reilly's on Saturday.  Out of nowhere, I walked in and heard this noise, and I was like, interesting.  Quick footnote, ass note, whatever, note.  Yeah.  After the whole thing was done yesterday, I had one of the best shits I've ever had in  my life.  I was going to ask if it came out nicely.  It slid out like a toboggan run.  It was wonderful.  Has that relaxed you in the end?  No, I think it's a little lube up there. 
[03:54:00]  Just slid everything out?  Yeah, kind of.  Like a slip and slide.  Where, you know, I was having a few of the milk dud things going on for a while.  It was just smooth as silk.  Looked like a Vostok rocket.  Consistency.  Perfect.  It should be like the length of a banana and the consistency of toothpaste.  Oh.  Yeah.  Wonderful.  I love it.  Brush your teeth with it.  Oh, big shit.  Okay, this is the mathematicians.  Mathematicians, what's the difference? 
[03:54:30]  I hate it.  It's a clockwork orange.  Texas Instrument Calculator.  It's really different.  I'm not sure if this is a song I heard.  You can ring my bell.  Ring my bell.  My bell.  Ring-a-ring-a-ling.  I hate it someone's knocking on my door.  If someone's ringing the bell, do me a favor.  Take your wooden leg and get the fuck out.  Are they really mathematicians? 
[03:55:00]  I have an equation.  Square root.  I have an equation.  This song plus my ears equals torture.  Right.  This is not the song I heard, unfortunately.  This is not the song you're looking for.  No.  Do we got the whole CD?  Is this the only sample?  This next one's about the Pythagorean theorem, motherfucker. 
[03:55:30]  Yeah, wrong.  Yeah, this is, wow.  Did you have a finger in your ass when you heard this?  Sometimes in life, you've got to solve for X, man.  Just got to solve for X?  I've got to find the song now.  I'm obsessed.  We can't say we're standing.  All right.  Wow.  Got that sort of high-pitched.  Yeah.  That's just not the song I heard, so whatever.  He sounds like Geddy Lee, and yet he does it at all.  No, nothing like him.  Just let us sit there.  I'll try to find that. 
[03:56:00]  Oh, no.  We're not going to let us sit there.  There must have been a lot of reverb that night.  Why would we let that sit there?  That wasn't the song, though.  I don't care.  Yeah.  Even Zeppelin had a bad song.  One.  He liked the mathematicians.  All right.  Now I've got to find the song.  You know, people will be with me.  Yeah?  Hey, we're going to have tickets to give out at the Hard Rock Cafe tonight at 6 o'clock.  Yeah.  So if you don't have it now, still got a chance to go.  This is brand new.  A brand new communique. 
[03:56:30]  Oh.  I made it sound like I knew.  We'll have some tickets to the Halloween party at the Hard Rock Cafe starting at 6 o'clock  tonight in Times Square.  Hard Rock.  Hard Rock Cafe.  When are we supposed to be there?  Oh, at the Tone.  I don't know.  Doors open at what?  Seven?  Seven.  Yeah.  So we'll get there at 6.55.  Okay.  I have to.  I'm going to nap.  Yeah, me too.  I have to run in and out.  I can do a photo shoot today.  You actually have to be at the party and then run out and do comedy. 
[03:57:00]  Yes, and come back.  And then come back.  And do comedy after.  And do...  You're a crazy person.  You're very dedicated, Jimmy.  You're craft.  Tomorrow, I've got to do it for tomorrow.  What are you doing?  What are you doing?  I might not make it to the party tonight.  Oh, no.  He's got to go back in.  The look on his face.  Yeah, that was definitely the look of, I've got to really take a shit.  The California mudslides are about to begin.  It wasn't even that.  He's got a sickly look on his face.  Like he's disgusted with his own colon.  Yeah, he's got a mic. 
[03:57:30]  Okay.  E-Rock is giving him a mic.  If there's a guy, you won't make it to the bowl.  Oh, a little feedback.  What the hell was that?  We should make E-Rock kneel by the toilet and give him a helmet, Mike, so he doesn't  put his head into the bowl all of his shits.  All right.  All right.  Oh, shh, shh, shh.  Let's listen.  Today's line of the day is sponsored by...  Hey, want to give him his coffee? 
[03:58:00]  Hurry up!  I want to hear it.  I don't know.  I don't know if this...  It's going to work.  Just relax.  Read the sponsor copy.  It's being run into you right now.  Really?  By E-Rock.  Just tell him to slide it under the door.  No, make him...  Oh, I should spray him.  Tell him to slide it under the door.  No, make him kneel on the floor and hold it so you can read it like a teleprompter.  Oh.  All right.  Yeah, drop it.  Thank you. 
[03:58:30]  All right.  See, once you're sitting, though, and it doesn't come out immediately, you're in trouble.  More soft serve.  Oh, my God.  Dude, it sounds like something crawled up in him and died.  Oh, God damn.  Like Dreamcatcher.  What, did you eat sushi that was being served out of the back of a station wagon? 
[03:59:00]  Oh, God.  All right.  As it releases...  Yeah.  Line of the day is sponsored by Bodogfight.com.

Fight.com, a mixed martial arts tournament and docu-reality unlike any seen before. 
[03:59:30]  You're going to hurt yourself.  We got two runner-ups today.  And it'll be shit sponsored by Tom the Turkey from Carvel Ice Cream.  And spring back.  Oh, my God.  Here is the first runner-up line of the day.  You just won, on behalf of H57, $5,050.  Congratulations.  How do you feel? 
[04:00:00]  Fat.  Come on, honey.  Hey, I hope he picks up a runner-up line of the day.  I like that.  With fat.  How do you feel?  Fat.  Of course she does.  There's a second runner-up line of the day today.  And here...  Ew.  It is.  His name is Geronaholo.  Let's go to Matt on Long Island. 
[04:00:30]  Matt.  Yo.  Hey.  What's up?  What's up, Matt?  Kneeling bull.  Dances with men.  Oh, I pick up a runner-up.  Very funny.  Yay.  With my faggot Steve line.  And finally, here is...  Line of the day.  Today.  Today.  Ah, Jimmy got him.  He started playing it. 
[04:01:00]  Line of the day.  There's a...  Here.  Here.  Here.  Comes.  But...  But I...  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Oh, Derek.  I...  Hi, honey.  Hello.  How are you?  This is Kathy Dolphin from H57.  Congratulations.  Isn't that funny?  Yes, Jimmy.  Jimmy, I give it to you. 
[04:01:30]  A dolphin talking to a whale.  Oh, okay.  I think that was a team effort.  Me and Jimmy's head spun around and just looked at each other.  She said her name.  I know.  She said dolphin.  We just went whoosh and looked at each other.  I'll share that on it, though, because Anthony could have said that as easily, exactly the  same way as I did.  So I don't mind sharing that one, because he...  It wasn't even...  Yeah, the same idea.  It was the same line.  Same line.  A dolphin talking to a whale.  We knew the fucking line was coming out of one of us. 
[04:02:00]  And came Jimmy the alley-oop.  He felt dark.  He really did.  All right.  Oh, my God.  How are you feeling in there?  Nah, this is just...  Is it going to take a while?  This is just a major backup.  Is it really?  Because your face looks so disappointed.  And like I said, if it doesn't happen right when you sit down, then you're just going to  hurt yourself.  Yeah.  Do you have roids?  No.  I don't think so. 
[04:02:30]  Uh, I guess we have, uh, another mathematician song.  Really?  Yeah, let's play a little bit of that.  Hopefully it's the good one.  Maybe it's the one...  Yeah, let us know if it's the one, uh...  All right.  ...you heard.  All right.  What's this called, Than?  Binary Girl.  Binary Girl.  Come on.  Stop it.  Hold on a minute.  All right.  I'm a one.  No, I'm a zero.  No, nothing.  I got it.  They do math songs.  One.  That's right.  Two. 
[04:03:00]  Whip it good.  Three.  Wham.  Wham.  Two.  Wham.  Wham.  Binary Girl.  What year is this?  What year is this?  What year is this?  What year is this?  Death scouts.  Waiting on drives.  Searching comments.  In fact, binary girl.  So logical.  These high-doglyphics.  So much logical.  My.  Is this Thomas Dolby? 
[04:03:30]  God.  I'd rather take what is coming out of Obie's ass and put it in my ears.  You know, if you take this band and multiply them by zero, they equal zero.  Oh, wait.  Anything multiplied by zero is equal zero.  Yes, of course.  I'm not a math person.  But it makes them zero, too, though, I guess.  Yeah.  If you take any number and multiply it by this band, it is zero.  There you go.  Good job, Ben. 
[04:04:00]  Wow.  Yes.  Ben with the corrections.  That really blows.  There's another one?  There's another one?  Two more corrections.  Right on a pony.  Great.  Was that it, Obie?  Was that the one?  What?  Was that the one you heard last night?  No.  No, that wasn't it either.  That song was Horrible Squared.  Try another one.  Bye, never go.  That was the cube root of shit.  Oh.  That's appropriate.  That's the next song.  Oh, God. 
[04:04:30]  All right.  It's going to be a long day.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Ready for another?  What's the name of this track, Ben?  Yeah.  Which one is this, Ben?  This is XOXO.  Hey, you know what fucking...  XOXO.  I know when Obie can go as his costume, he can go as a frozen yogurt dispenser.  That was hurtful.  That's got a tummy ache.  The stinkiest frozen yogurt dispenser ever.  You know what I don't hear? 
[04:05:00]  I don't hear the washing of the hands.  Nope.  Not at all.  No.  And you won't.  No.  Screw that.  That is horrid.  He doesn't care.  I know.  I know.  I don't care.  It really...  Wash your hands, please.  Yeah.  Did you wash?  Yeah.  I did.  I didn't hear.  Well, you guys were playing Binary Girl.  Binary Girl.  The shit mic is right near you, Laszlo.  Put the fucking bacteria mic next to me.  Thanks, buddy.  All right.  Which one is this?  XOXO.  XOXO. 
[04:05:30]  Hear what 80s song this sounds like.  Someone left the Casio out for this motherfucker.  This isn't helping your case, though, basically. 
[04:06:00]  Not really.  I've been through three of these guys' songs, and...  Were you an ecstasy?  Were you a spinning glow stick?  With a fucking mask on his face with Vicks Vapo rub in it.  Sweating profusely.  These guys make modern English sound like Saddam. 
[04:06:30]  That's not it.  Are we right now?  There's another.  No.  Oh, there's plenty more to do this, Ron.  This is the last one.  I'll tell you.  This one better fucking rock, man.  No, I hope so.  This one better, Ron.  The right guardian commercial.  We'll be right back. 
[04:07:00]  I love the fucking Kenny singing Monster Mesh.  That was a good friggin' song.  What is this?  Like their version of YYZ?  Oh, God.  Is there any more?  No.  That's it. 
[04:07:30]  I think we played like five songs by him.  I think you could give a pretty good shot.  Someone flipped you a roofie.  That's really bad.  Yeah.  Fell miserably on that.  Well, how about at the end of the show, as we're much more done, I would like to pick a song.  Oh, you would?  Yeah.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  We're done.  Let me have to.  Oh, we're going.  All right.  Oh, by the way, do you know Brother Joe picked up a bunch of – he actually had printed up, went and found the original whatever you need to do this. 
[04:08:00]  Rot Gut, Live at the Apollo, CDs.  He had a bunch printed up, and they will be available this evening.  He's going to be at the show?  Yeah, he's coming down with a bunch of those.  No.  It's us in blackface in front of the Apollo rocket.  It's one of the most racially insensitive covers ever.  It's horrific.  Oh, no.  And, yeah. 
[04:08:30]  That was from, like, 1992.  Is he back again?  Jesus Christ.  Holy shit.  Opie, you're going to have real difficulties tonight.  He just got up disgusted again with his colon.  Old tsunami colon.  It's coming back out again.  Just when you think you're safe.  He lasted, like, four minutes in here.  That was four minutes at most.  Whatever it is is coming out now, and I don't know why I said that.  Did I need to say that?  No.  He's shitting it, and Dr. Norton points out that it's exiting his body. 
[04:09:00]  Here we go.  Like a sports commentator.  They really want to win this game.  He's back in in the bathroom.  You ought to make Eric wipe your butt by putting toilet paper on his dick.  Just scraping it again.  You're not going to be pissed that he has to use toilet paper.  I know.  His bone would keep poking through it.  We should end the show with Monster Mash, by the way.  Well, the Club Soda Kenny version, is that available?  Yeah.  Let's hear it. 
[04:09:30]  Do we have that cute out there?  And then after Monster Mash.  Oh, my God.  Oh, this is going to be a good one.  Dude.  There's Monster Mash coming out of his ass.  It's Monster Mush.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  I'm Paul R. Nelson. 
[04:10:00]  Someone say Paul R. Nelson.  Oh, the dam broke.  Wow, did that sound so fucking bad.  Derek threw his headphones off.  It sounded like somebody was dumping a fishbowl full of fish into a toilet.  You can't wait to see the microphone as we chunk the shit on it. 
[04:10:30]  Here it is.  You got another volley?  Another salvo in you?  Holy shit, Danny's laughing.  There's only a certain few that really find that hysterically funny, and Danny's one of them.  Oh, is that nasty.  Funny, Danny?  Absolutely.  Yeah, always.  All right.  Oh, shit. 
[04:11:00]  God, that ran for such a long time, too.  Wash your hands.  Wash them.  I want to hear the sink.  What?  Wash your hands.  I'm dehydrated.  Remember, a sailor goes to many lands anywhere he pleases, but he always remembers to wash 
[04:11:30]  his hands so he don't catch no diseases.  Is that what sailors do?  They fuck crannies.  Exactly.  And you're trying to tell us you didn't enjoy that finger yesterday, huh?  Nothing.  A sailor goes to many lands, he catches VD from a nine-year-old Vietnamese girl.  Yeah.  That's right, see?  People on Pal Talk know where that came from.  Where?  Captain Carl. 
[04:12:00]  Captain Carl.  Irish Alki.  See?  He's wasted his entire life just sitting in front of a fucking television drinking.  Irish Alki watches those shows because he's too drunk to stand.  No matter what's on, he watches it.  He's seen test pattern.  Did my phone fall in the toilet?  Fucking unsociable drunk.  Yeah, he's a fucking...  What a sot.  Say hello once, you fucking lush.  What's wrong with your phone, Opie?  He's a liquored up sot, that fucking Irish Alki.  Sot.  Is he...  Hello?  Testing, Opie?  Yeah. 
[04:12:30]  Coming back?  Yeah.  You washed your hands, right?  Yeah.  Good man.  You heard it.  If I don't get my Obey Face shirt, I'm going to fucking cry.  That poured out of your ass.  That just poured out.  What song do you want to hear, Jimmy?  I want to hear 1916 by Motorhead.  Yeah?  Yeah, it's one of my favorite songs.  I want to hear Monster Mash by Club Soda Kenny.  That has to play.  Yeah.  Monster Mash.  I'm saying, after this show...  We're on 1916.  How about We Are Motorhead?  What the fuck is...  What's this place?  What the fuck?  What the fuck? 
[04:13:00]  What are you fucking...  We Are Motorhead?  Monster Mash has to be the one that closes the show.  You play that after.  It's not...  That's not part of the show.  Is that a big piece of cake or what?  We're pretty winded there, Ope.  Oh, no.  Yeah, that was a good workout.  You've got to be kidding me.  No way.  You've got to be fucking kidding.  No fucking way you've got to go back.  This is impossible.  It's impossible.  I'm trying to tell you.  Every time he stands up...  You want tears to come out of my ass?  Every time he stands up, it settles back down.  Yeah, it just comes down a little more. 
[04:13:30]  All right.  Open that door.  Open that door.  I want to break the key off of it.  That shit poured down his fucking pant leg.  His pant.  Here it goes.  Okay.  You can talk.  No, we can't.  No, no.  I kind of like the subtleties.  You can hear that little crackling sound and...  You know.  I'll give anybody $100 to reach in and take the toilet paper away. 
[04:14:00]  Phew.  Oh, I'll be...  You rockin'.  Oh, god damn it.  Oh, god damn it. 
[04:14:30]  Oh, god damn it.  How was that disgusting?  How was that fucking disgusting?  Oh, yeah.  I wish Bob Kelly was here.  He would be puking up a storm. 
[04:15:00]  I wish Bob Kelly was in there with his mouth open.  Hey.  Hey.  This is a radio show.  I know.  How ridiculous is this?  This show is on 25...  We want to take over L.A. someday.  How did we not make a good case?  Wow.  And by the way, the Let's Motorhead selection sucks a baby dick.  Oof.  Sure does.  Lucky it. 
[04:15:30]  All right.  You all right now?  Wait, you guys want that?  You're going to be able to walk into here and sit down and...  I got it.  That's good.  He's watching your face.  If you don't have this, I'm going to fucking...  I'm going to put my foot through the let.  It's...  I know it's big.  I'm strong.  It's...  It's...  It's...  Through the let.  The whole thing...  You ever see that place down in Washington?  Black Sabbath.  It's a room the size of a football stadium full of computer...  Hard drives. 
[04:16:00]  Black Sabbath.  It's all volume four and the song is called Under the Sun.  All right.  Don't make him put his foot through the let.  I'll kick the whole the let system over.  Carried the let in my back.  Throw it.  Oh, you actually got that one?  Yes, we got to play.  We got to finish out of the show and then I'll do that one.  What?  Damn it.  No fucking way.  He washed his thing. 
[04:16:30]  He didn't even make it to the door?  Nope.  He's going back in.  I had this already.  What?  You had like a flu?  Yeah, it was...  Stomach flu?  You didn't puke though.  You were just shitting.  Oh, God.  It's fun actually.  Jesus.  He's really pushing.  He's going to have a speckled butt. 
[04:17:00]  All right.  That should be good.  I hope so.  Yeah.  All right.  I think that's good.  You think you're right?  You think you're set there? 
[04:17:30]  Good luck getting home.  Problem?  No.  I mean, with having to shit every ten seconds.  He's rollerblading through the park, shitting his pants.  Time to wash my hands again.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  I love how Opie is shitting his brains out, and you two are both text messaging.  What the fuck?  I know.  We're texting each other. 
[04:18:00]  I just sent him on this.  It was your dick hard, too.  In fact, yes.  We're both just texting.  No, Sam's texting.  How do you...  Opie's shitting his brains out.  We're all texting, and it's a radio show.  Oh, this is terrible.  I was just trying to ruin something.  Oh, you were trying to ruin my texting. 
[04:18:30]  It was a quick one, you bastard.  I knew somebody would.  What did you just text?  It's going to be a while.  Yeah, it's going to be a couple of minutes.  It sounds like a Snickers commercial.  Oof.  Where to wreck things.  Yeah, well...  I was just thinking of not going anywhere for a fun.  Explain it.  That'll help you get a laugh.  Is he back in?  Yep.  This is...  Impossible. 
[04:19:00]  He's hurting himself.  What do you think you ate, Ope?  What?  What do you think you ate?  Burning.  Um...  I don't remember.  Your ass is going to be burning.  You don't feel sick, right?  He's pissing out his asshole.  I think it was a round of applause at a golf game.  Oh, my God.  Oh, fuck. 
[04:19:30]  Oh, shit.  That sounded like a big one, though.  Was that the plug?  Because it tends to solid up after you get those watery ones.  Why do you bother flushing?  Just stay there.  Just stand up, and then it...  Like, whatever you release, releases...  Like, makes room for more.  Yeah.  So then it gurgles...  Oh.  Hurtin' when you wipe?  Ah! 
[04:20:00]  Okay.  Why are we ending the show?  Well, we're trying to, but your asshole won't stop shitting.  Your asshole's chattin' up a storm.  Oh.  Is that, like, all acidic?  You gotta, like, douse a piece of toilet paper under the water or something.  Okay.  And then dab.  Do a little dabbing to get the acid off of there.  Maybe dust with a little baking soda to neutralize the pH. 
[04:20:30]  Yeah, he's basically just shitting stomach acid right now.  Yeah, that's it.  That's all that is.  Sure.  This is him shitting.  It sounds like a sink.  No, it sounds more solid.  What does he even bother with the hand-washing?  I don't know.  But I can tell you how jaded I am.  I could eat fuckin' that turkey stew while he was shitting.  While he was doing that?  No, I couldn't do that.  I could.  That still is good, though.  All right.  You all right?  I told you when I worked at Pergament, I worked with these two guys, Malcolm and this other 
[04:21:00]  guy whose nickname was Ever, and Malcolm was on the bowl shitting, and he had a pound  cake, and he passed it under the stall, and Ernest was the other guy, took the cake and  ate a piece of it, and then fuckin' passed it back under the stall while Malcolm was shitting,  and they were sharing a pound cake while Malcolm was on the toilet.  That is disgusting.  How the fuck?  Why would he do that?  I don't know.  You know the germs?  You'd catch some kind of...  You all right? 
[04:21:30]  Yeah.  Oh, beads of sweat.  Yeah, you like a little bit of sweat on your forehead?  Okay.  Oh, this asshole looks like tub girls.  Can we go home now?  Do you want a donut cushion to sit on?  All right.  We got to go home.  Colon blow.  We have another show we have to do today.  Yep.  Yeah.  I'm going to nap.  I'm going to see you guys tonight.  I'm going to nap. 
[04:22:00]  Show that banana.  Bananas are good for you when you...  Actually, when you're sick.  I'm not eating anything.  I want to hear Club Soda Kenny's Monster Mash.  Ooh, ooh, ooh.  That's in Dillette.  It's in Dillette?  And what's this?  Did Jimmy ruin Dillette?  Did you kick it?  Yeah, I shook it.  I went, ah.  All the songs fell out of it.  Baby hard drive fell out.  Dead and erased.  Yeah, we want to hear that.  And then Jimmy requested a song.  After the show, yeah.  After the show.  I had to get the...  What, so you could listen to it later on?  Yeah. 
[04:22:30]  Yeah.  But since the Motorhead selection fucking eats my asshole.  Can you not say that?  Yeah, please.  Let's keep in the seat for fucking three minutes.  That was funny.  When you played, after the big logs fell out and you played, I'm Paul R. Nelson.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  I can't believe you sent us stuff.  All right, what's the...  Like we're big fans.  What's the plug, Laszlo?  The PSP.  I got mine.  In stores today.  Featuring voices of the ONA staff.  I need some Paul R. Nelson bumper stickers. 
[04:23:00]  Yeah.  I got a Paul R. Nelson shirt.  Oh, I'm so thrilled.  I'm going home with partying gifts today.  And tomorrow night, I'll be on the David Letterman program.  Yes.  Let's hope it's good.  And...  You'll rule.  November 10, Hammerstein Ballroom and New Year's Eve Bogota Casino.  I'm going to that one.  Spending New Year's Eve with Jamie.  Good.  Aren't you coming?  Are you busy?  What are you doing New Year's Eve?  I think I'll go.  I think I'll go to that.  And tonight, Halloween party. 
[04:23:30]  Hard Rock Cafe.  Yes, 7 p.m.  7 p.m.  But tickets available now starting at 6.  We got some extra tickets to give out.  Ooh.  And if you don't get in right away, form a line.  Because like last year, people did leave as the night went on.  And we'll get more people in, okay?  We certainly will.  We'll be signing copies of FHM tonight after the show.  And we're broadcasting the whole thing.  Blah, blah, blah.  And live at the Apollo.  Oh, yeah.  It's going to be a great show tonight.  Today was a really good radio show.  Tonight's going to be even better.  Joe Curry's going to be there, too.  So you'll actually get three members of the band Rotgut. 
[04:24:00]  Yeah?  Oh, please.  Colin Quinn is confirmed.  From 1992.  Colin's coming by?  Colin's confirmed.  Patrice is coming by.  The bill hasn't confirmed, but Bill Burr will probably be there.  Is there going to be a special guest?  Oh, I don't know.  Good, good.  Oh, special guest.  We didn't even talk about that today.  We didn't talk about it.  We never announced it.  We never even said if there was going to be one.  Right now?  Yeah.  They wouldn't even let me put it in the promo.  Yeah, I know.  In case the person didn't show up.  Can we announce special guest?  Yeah.  Here it is.  Flavor!  Flavor!  Flavor! 
[04:24:30]  Flavor!  First time in I don't know how long.  How many years?  Is he actually going to perform?  Yes.  He's performing tonight.  He's performing live.  At our Halloween party.  Flavor Flav.  Flavor Flav.  Yeah, boy!  He's going to be performing.  He'll be rapping.  I don't know why we didn't announce this weeks ago when we knew that he was going to.  I don't know why weeks ago we didn't announce this, and we could have had a much more diverse  crowd come down, but no.  For some reason, I kept arguing for it, please, can we announce it, and everybody said no. 
[04:25:00]  Right, right.  That's right.  And another word that starts with the same letter.  That's right.  All right.  Can we go on?  All right.  We actually have a sign on the door with Sam's picture, and he says, if you're any darker  than this, turn yourself right around.  Come on.  I want to hear Monster Mash.  All right.  All right.  We leave you.  Sounds of Opie's ass sound.  Sounds of a retard singing.  This is Club Soda Kenny.  Yeah.  I think he's performing this song live tonight. 
[04:25:30]  He has to.  Make sure you get the karaoke of this for Club Soda Kenny.  Yes.  Kenny might be doing two songs tonight, Secret Agent Man as well.  Oh, that's right.  He loves that one.  We're going to just make it up as we go along.  He loves that one.  Is he going to wear his costume that he wore?  I hope so.  Because he sweats in it.  I sure hope so.  I love when we're on the road, and people are in line for merchandise, and they'll yell  Secret Agent Man, and I'll go buy something, and maybe I will.  And they buy something, and he gives them a verse.  What a creep.  Oh, he's a fucking horse.  He's a team player.  He's chill.  All right. 
[04:26:00]  Yeah.  Here's the.  That's it.  We'll see you tonight.  Bye, sweeties.  I need some water.  I need a lot of water.  I bet you do.  I lost about a gallon out of your ass in two minutes.  All right.  Here we go.  Here we go.  I think he comes in now.  I was working in the lab late one night when my eyes beheld an eerie sight.  For my monster from his slab began to rise, and suddenly, to my surprise, he did the mash. 
[04:26:30]  He did the monster mash.  The monster mash.  It was a graveyard smash.  He did the mash.  It caught on in a flash.  He did the mash.  He did the monster mash.  From my laboratory in the castle east, to the master bedroom where the vampires feast.  The ghouls all came from humble abodes to get a jolt from my electrodes. 
[04:27:00]  They did the mash.  They did the monster mash.  The monster mash.  It was a graveyard smash.  They did the mash.  It caught on in a flash.  They did the mash.  They did the monster mash.  The zombies were having fun.  The party had just begun.  The guests included Wolfman, Dracula, and his son.  The scene was rocking, and all were digging the sounds. 
[04:27:30]  Igor on chains, backed by the banging hounds.  The coffin bangers were about to arrive with the vocal group, the Crip Kicker Five.  They did the monster mash.  They played the monster mash.  It was a graveyard smash.  They played the monster mash.  They caught on in a flash.  They played the mash.  Then they played the monster mash. 
[04:28:00]  This got a lot of lyrics.  Out from his coffin, Drax's voice didn't ring.  Seems he was troubled by just one thing.  He opened the lid and shook his fist and said, whatever happened to my Transylvania twist?  It's now the mash.  It's now the monster mash.  The monster mash.  And it's a graveyard smash.  It's now the mash.  It caught on in a flash.  It's now the mash.  It's now the monster mash. 
[04:28:30]  Now everything's cool.  Drax's a part of the band.  And my monster mash is a hit of the land.  For you the living this mash was meant to.  When you get to my door, tell them Boris sent you.  What did they do?  They did the mash. 
[04:29:00]  They did the monster mash.  The monster mash.  And do my graveyard smash.  They can do the mash.  It'll caught on in a flash.  They can do the mash.  Then you do the monster mash.  Oh!  Well, I'm Soda Kenny, everyone.  Wow.  Fantastic.  It will caught on in a flash.  It will caught on in a flash.  It will caught on in a flash.  Great.  Thank you.  Thank you. 
[04:29:30]  Thank you. 
[04:30:00]  Thank you. 
[04:30:30]  Thank you.

[04:33:00]  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  guitar solo
