<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a highly critical and profane discussion of the 2008 Super Tuesday primaries.  Opie and Anthony vehemently attacked Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama's campaign promises, particularly regarding healthcare and environmental policies, repeatedly labeling them "socialist" and "communist."  They also commented on John McCain's appearance and likelihood of becoming the Republican nominee.  The segment included numerous audio clips of Clinton and Obama, interspersed with the hosts' crude commentary and jokes, such as a parody song titled "Rock Around Barack," and mockery of Clinton's coughing fit.  A caller, Chris, shared his criticisms of the healthcare system and pharmaceutical companies.  The "F.U. Line" segment allowed callers to leave obscene messages, and the "Wake Up Your Spouse Wednesday" segment featured a caller waking his spouse with a glass of water, resulting in further expletives.  A "Guess the Sound" segment also concluded this section.

The show continued with a recurring bit designed to frustrate a caller who correctly identified a sound.  This was followed by a discussion and audio clips of Vince McMahon's WWE appearances, which the hosts compared to Anthony's McMahon impression.  A lengthy, irreverent dissection of the movie *Twister* ensued, focusing on its dialogue and perceived flaws, peppered with vulgar and sexually suggestive comments.  Caller Flea was also discussed in relation to a suggestive image on the show's website.  On-air interviews with New York City residents regarding their voting choices were also conducted during this segment. Vinnie Brandt was a guest in the studio throughout parts of this section.

The *Twister* discussion continued, with Opie, Anthony, Jim Norton, and Vinnie Brandt (in studio) quoting absurd lines from the film and teasing Brandt.  Listener calls contributed further *Twister* quotes and observations.  A recurring bit mimicking Matt Roloff's voice from *Little People, Big World* was also featured. George A. Romero, director of *Night of the Living Dead*, joined the broadcast, discussing his films, particularly the *Night of the Living Dead* series, creative process, and answering listener questions. A new audio bit, "Rock Like Barack," was also introduced.

The in-studio interview with George A. Romero dominated the next segment.  Romero discussed the challenges of making zombie movies, including casting, directing zombie actors, using practical versus CGI effects, and a particularly unpleasant experience with cockroaches. He recounted being fired from a *Resident Evil* adaptation (though still compensated).  The conversation covered various zombie films and literature, the prevalence of horror remakes, and listener questions, including one about zombies' inability to climb stairs.  Funny moments included discussing a zombie snapping its fingers and a gruesome but humorous scene featuring a Jay Leno zombie. A caller shared a childhood anecdote about wanting to be trapped in a mall during a zombie apocalypse.

Following the Romero interview, the hosts discussed the New England Patriots' Super Bowl loss, with a phone call from comedian Bill Burr.  The segment also covered allegations against Britney Spears' manager from court documents, detailing alleged drug abuse and controlling behavior.  The death of Cherry Darcher from an accidental prescription drug overdose was briefly mentioned, alongside a humorous exchange about a PalTalk user exposing their buttocks on camera. A note from Ron and Fez criticizing an intern's behavior was also read.

The final segment focused on relentlessly teasing the show's intern, Adam, for his perceived awkwardness, stemming from an incident where he allegedly "creeped out" Ron and Fez.  The hosts and Vinnie Brandt repeatedly mocked Adam's social ineptitude, his virginity at age 22, and speculated about his sexuality and possible underlying issues.  Crude jokes about Adam's penis size and sexual experiences were frequent.  Adam's apology note to Ron and Fez was mentioned, as was a past rejection from a girl.  The hosts offered speculative diagnoses for his social issues. The conversation shifted to comedian Ray Garvey's terminal illness, followed by more ribbing of Adam and a concluding mention of a "Mound Wednesday" featuring a woman with large breasts.  A call was scheduled for the girl Adam had a crush on to appear the following day.

[00:00:00]  In the world of Radio Shock Jocks, the biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their office.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why? Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good.  Go screw!  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony.

The world gives you a strip club advice, and then you go and see Little Mermaid the next day.  It's not like I went with a gay guy.  Your girlfriend did it with you.  Entertainment is going.  I think if you were touched inappropriately, it would make it like a quick pop song.  Yeah.  Like the Beatles used to do in the love, love, me, don't. 
[00:01:00]  Yeah.  You're like, shit, freeze!  Tell us what happened.  I had a patient who was a college student and was really, really depressed, and he killed himself.  It's time for people to understand these are words.  If you don't like them, turn the dial.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Come on, come on!  Come on, get the show on the road. 
[00:01:30]  Come on, come on, let's go!  Come on!  Come on, are you with me?  Start spreading our nose.  I'm leaving today.  I'm leaving today.  Come on, Snoop, tap dance!  I'm leaving today.  Yeah.  Come on.  I want to be a part of it.  Come on!  New York.  Come on!  New York.  Come on.  I want to wake up in a city that never sleeps.  Come on, I'm waiting on you. 
[00:02:00]  I'm following your lead.  I'm your background.  This is the very same show.  You're hanging me out the dry.  Snoop should have shot him right there.  Just pulled out the gat, turned it sideways, and shot Larry in the head.  How many people were doing that yesterday, though?  Come on, come on!  Come on, start spreading the news.  I couldn't stop doing it.  All day.  I'm leaving today.  Come on!  I'm yelling.  Larry's an ass.  A horse's ass. 
[00:02:30]  He sure is.  So, Super Tuesday.  Dunsky.  Not really Dunsky.  Well, McCain, obviously, Dunsky.  He's going to be the dude.  Not officially, but he's got such a lead.  Such a lead.  And he's got short arms, and he's psychotic.  Well, he was beaten to a pulp in some Vietnamese hell camp. 
[00:03:00]  Give me the watch.  Yeah.  I carried this uncomfortable piece.  I love that.  Hello, little man.  So, I don't know.  McCain's got a huge lead, obviously.  He's going to be the...  He does.  The Republican.  It looks like he's...  Not me.  Yeah.  And then you got Hillary and Obama.  They're pretty much saying it's a tie.  Still duking it out.  And there were some surprises there, because, well, Hillary won New York and California. 
[00:03:30]  Those are two biggies.  Yeah.  And then I'm reading in the paper this morning, Obama won, like, very, very extremely white states.  Uh, yeah.  I'm serious.  People like this guy, man.  He won Connecticut.  He won Utah.  I think they got the Hartford vote out.  That's what happened.  In Connecticut?  He really got a lot of people from Hartford to vote.  He won extremely white states.  Yes, Jimmy. 
[00:04:00]  They said, uh, here in the paper, it says that she lost ground among, like, her core.  Like, she won 50 to 44% whites, but, uh, he crushed her among young white people, 65% to 35%.  Mm-hmm.  That's what I was saying yesterday.  Young people, right.  Young people, you know, they like that whole change thing, screw the man, man kind of a attitude.  Well, they're calling him a fast-growing, improbable, cool, iconic figure among students and artists. 
[00:04:30]  Not in my house.  What?  So they're calling him what?  God.  All right, shut up.  Can you keep your racism down to a dull roar?  A dull roar.  Keep that down to a dull roar.  I was listening to a little bit of the replay yesterday.  Yeah.  And, uh, and out loud, I turned around and just went, I am such a racist.  Well, it's about time you admit it.  I'm just listening.  No.  Acceptance is the first step.  I was goofing with myself. 
[00:05:00]  I was making points yesterday.  I was making these points.  Yeah, you keep saying you're goofing.  And, uh, no, I wasn't goofing.  I was actually making valid points on how I feel and some people I know feel and, uh, I think an unspoken majority feel.  But, uh, as I'm making these points, I'm listening to the replay just going, oh, jeez, do I sound bad?  Well, Obama won Utah, very white state, Minnesota, an extremely white state, Idaho, white.  There's three black people in Idaho and two after he left. 
[00:05:30]  I hear there's a big gang problem in Idaho.  Oh, okay.  All right.  I don't know.  North Dakota.  What are they throwing potato spuds at each other?  Just spuds.  There's nothing to do out there.  Drive-by spudding.  Uh, North Dakota is a hotbed for, uh, blood activity.  Yes.  Yeah.  He won North Dakota and, uh, Kansas.  Wow.  That's a lot of white states, I'm thinking.  And then, of course, you throw Georgia and Alabama in there.  And, uh, and Obama did very well.  I think Obama's very happy. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah.  With what happened on Super Tuesday, uh, yesterday.  Although he lost, uh, what?  Massachusetts.  Yes.  A snub to the Kennedys and this whole new Camelot, uh, second coming of JFK thing, um, with Teddy  giving his, uh, blessing, uh, he lost Massachusetts.  Right.  I think Clinton had a huge lead up there, though.  Well, yeah.  I think it was a long shot to begin with, and, uh, he lost it in the end.  But, uh, Obama's camp very, very happy.  Hillary's camp very, very happy. 
[00:06:30]  Yeah.  They were congratulating each other.  They, they said in the paper today, this isn't going to be figured out until July or  August.  What?  Really?  Yeah.  Who the nominee is going to be?  McCain.  Democrats, yeah.  Yeah.  McCain.  That's going to be wrapped up, uh, sooner than later, obviously.  But, uh, yeah, Clinton and Obama, that race is going to continue until possibly July  or August.  Wow.  That's pretty crazy, right?  That's a lot of money, too.  They're going to be dishing out.  So, uh, we got, uh, Hillary with her coughing fit. 
[00:07:00]  Yeah, I saw that on, uh, Drudge.  It was some, the title, always sensational on there.  It said, uh, Hillary Health Scare on Super Tuesday.  So, I was like, oh, what's this?  Click, I click on it.  And she has a little coughing fit.  It is a pretty good one, though.  And she's been known to have these when she talks too much, and she's constantly yapping.  So, uh, I don't know, it was kind of funny.  She's doing an interview.  Yeah.  They have her on, uh, you know, satellite, via satellite, her little picture on one side,  the person, the guy that's interviewing her on the other side of the screen, and he's  talking, and she starts coughing. 
[00:07:30]  And he just keeps, like, talking, thinking she's just going to stop coughing, but she  doesn't.  So, then he's got to go into this whole thing of how the cough is part of, uh, her campaigning  for a long time.  And, uh, she doesn't stop.  The funniest part, though, is everything he says, she's got these quick one word between  cough answers, where she holds one finger up and goes, yes, sorry, okay, I think so.  And she's just hacking.  She just had a tickle in the back of her throat.  Yeah, you're going to tickle, all right.  It was probably a hair. 
[00:08:00]  She didn't have a lozenge nearby?  No lozenge.  She needs a lozenge.  She couldn't reach for a lozenge.  One of our old bits, words that we hate saying.  One of them.  Yeah, one of them certainly is lozenge.  What a dumb word.  Jimmy, say it.  I love when you say lozenge.  Lozenge.  It's almost like sausage.  Yeah, sausage.  Sausage.  Say it home.  Lozenge.  You know Frank Sanrelli, the comedian from Boston?  He was on The Sopranos. 
[00:08:30]  He was Georgie.  He was the driver.  Sure, sure, yeah, yeah.  He's a funny comedian.  He has a bit on words like that.  And one of them is lozenge.  Lozenge.  Maybe that's where we got it from.  Probably Sanrelli, yeah.  Yeah.  All right, here's Hillary coughing her brains out.  How will you use your husband, Bill Clinton, in the administration?  We assume he won't be.  You know this.  Sorry.  Sorry.  I was reading in the paper yesterday, and this is what happens in these long campaigns.  You know what, I won't hold you on here any longer, because you probably could use some 
[00:09:00]  water there.  Sorry.  Senator, thank you.  Hillary Clinton live from New York.  Stop your spilling it.  Find her face down in a tomato field, a little tomato garden.  Well, the guy brought up Bill Clinton, right?  Yeah.  Maybe she was getting a little worried that he might be going down that road. 
[00:09:30]  Oh, he might stray?  That he might be going down that road.  Had to take care of him and some alien stuff she's not used to.  So she's thinking, all right, I'll get out of this tough questioning by just coughing.  Walking around doing the interview with an orange peel in her mouth.  Trying to scare the reporter.  And then we got... 
[00:10:00]  She needed a lozenge.  Yeah, we got Hillary acting like crazy.  Oh, I love it.  Two Hillary's.  There's the subdued talking one, and then the robot.  Well, she was very excited.  She did well yesterday.  Yeah.  I think a lot of people would say that Obama did better.  I think Obama got more states, but Hillary got more delegates.  Well, she got the biggies.  She got California.  The delegate rich California and New York.  She got the biggies, but I don't think Obama was supposed to do as well as he did yesterday. 
[00:10:30]  How could you say that in this climate and with this hype that he's got going?  He has got some hype.  I'm not surprised at anything that this guy does as far as results go.  Well, that's why Hillary's camp very, very nervous, because the momentum is continuing,  and they don't know how to stop the Obama train.  They don't know how to stop that momentum.  I was listening to Ron and Fez yesterday, and Earl, you know, Black Earl, was talking  about Obama like he does constantly. 
[00:11:00]  All he does now is put up his fist like a black power sign and goes, Obama, 2008.  I'm like, oh, just stop it.  And he was like, the excitement behind this guy is amazing, because I was in Brooklyn yesterday,  and all I saw was signs and people just chanting, Obama, Obama, and they're walking around.  So I walk over to one of my windows, because I'm home listening, and I peek out.  I don't see this excitement and signs that Earl's talking about. 
[00:11:30]  My neighborhood, I didn't see one sign, not one person chanting, Obama, Obama.  You opened your window and heard fear.  I just heard the silence of fear.  You just heard a lot of fear.  I heard deadbolts locking.  That's all I hear in my neighborhood.  I'm liking this Obama more and more every day, man.  He's becoming a pop culture icon.  Well, the youth of America just loving this guy. 
[00:12:00]  Really?  Yes!  Will you wake up and read an article?  Wake up.  My eyes are open, my friend.  The youth of America are loving this guy.  You all know how smart they are.  Well, they're coming out in record numbers to vote, too.  So we'll see what happens.  Here's Clinton after Super Tuesday talking to some peeps.  I see an America where we stand up to the oil companies  and the oil-producing countries  where we launch a clean energy revolution  and finally confront the climate crisis. 
[00:12:30]  I see an America where we don't just provide health care  for some people or most people,  but for every single bad woman and child.  There's no one.  And I see everyone becoming a leader.  How do you see that?  How does she see everybody getting health care?  I know. 
[00:13:00]  Tax the crap out of everybody that's worked hard their whole life  to make something of themselves  and turn the United States into a socialist nation.  Whenever you hear change, big change in Washington,  we need change, it's socialism.  Will you relax?  What?  I'm doing very well these days.  I worked my ass off my whole life.  Finally, I get to sit back in a little bit of comfort,  and I'm going to have to cough everything up  for socialized goddamn medicine  and socialized social programs 
[00:13:30]  because these idiots,  it won't change their life one iota?  Go screw.  I've had it.  I've had it with Democrats and liberals  and people with this dream,  this goddamn false dream  that everyone's going to share.  Go to Russia!  Goddamn communists.  They're all communists.  You're obviously on the fence.  Yeah.  How do you really feel?  You know, Anthony,  our lifestyles will not change. 
[00:14:00]  We like people to think  we're white trash shock jocks,  but I have enough money to live.  You do!  Yes, I do.  I don't!  Well, stop spending your money  because we've got to retire soon.  I'm not spending a lot of money.  You just have this misconception  of what being able to live  the rest of your life with is.  It ain't what we got.  I can live the rest of my life  with the money I got.  Not in the comfort you are accustomed to.  Are you insane?  You can't. 
[00:14:30]  My comfort is different  than your comfort.  Believe me.  I lived like a college kid  until six months ago.  Doesn't matter.  Well...  And now I'm going to live like,  you know,  like I'm just out of college  for the next 10 years.  A college kid with a hell of a mortgage.  Because I know  that mortgage I got  ain't no fun.  I'm not worried about  the health care  for every individual  in the United States.  You're not?  Where's that money coming from?  That's what I want to know,  Hillary and Obama.  Where's the money coming from  so every Tom, Dick, and Harry  can have health care? 
[00:15:00]  Listen,  health care  will get a little better  if Clinton or Obama  get into office.  A little better.  Dude,  she's saying every American.  It ain't gonna happen!  She's preaching it.  There's not a politician  in the last 30, 40 years  that have made drastic changes  like that.  She's gonna try it.  She's gonna get it  where it's a little better.  Tax the crap out of everybody.  It ain't happening!  And that's the point  I was trying to make here.  These stupid politicians,  they get up there  and they just make up crap. 
[00:15:30]  Do you know what  they consider wealthy?  $100,000 a year per household.  Live in New York City  on $100,000 a year  and let them call you rich.  You'll want to kill somebody.  Well, listen.  That's what I was trying to say, though.  These guys will say anything  to get elected.  She's just babbling  how the air's gonna be clean.  They're gonna take on  the oil companies  and the oil nations.  Thanks.  We're already paying  almost $4 a gallon.  But they're all doing this. 
[00:16:00]  That's what I'm saying.  The healthcare's gonna get  a tiny bit better  and then maybe  the environment's gonna get  maybe slightly better.  Communists.  There's gonna be  no drastic changes.  Commies!  I don't know, man.  The commies are back  from the 80s.  It's the new,  improved 21st century  communist.  I watched this sicko.  I understand it was  Michael Bohr's very biased.  Very biased.  Oh, Jesus.  But sicko was a very  maybe private.  I'm sure there's some of it  that was not accurate.  But when you see the way  they treat people,  man, like regular people  just go on and get  like operations 
[00:16:30]  they should be able to get.  It's just sickening.  Like, we really are  and I believe you  I don't like being taxed  at all.  So what are we  let me tell you something.  Spend the money better, I think.  Let me tell you  spend the money better.  Let me tell you something.  I pay through the  goddamn nose  for healthcare  for health insurance  for me and loved ones.  I'm paying.  That's what this  goddamn stupid  half country is about.  If you work hard  and get a little luck  and are able to 
[00:17:00]  achieve this American dream  that has been  plastered on us  since we were kids  everybody  since this country  was first built  the whole thing  is called  the American dream.  What is that?  Achieving  some sort of  comfort level  wealth  security  and now  that is something  to be penalized for.  That is something  to then  have taken from you  and given to people 
[00:17:30]  who for some reason  may be down on their luck  may be bad luck  may be laziness  may be just  bad decisions  or maybe it just  didn't happen for you.  But this country  is never a guaranteed  you're winning  you're going to get  everything you ask for  just because you're American.  That's bull crap.  The truth of the matter is  some people will make it  some people won't.  That's why  and it's not  my god damn  responsibility  or some stupid  ass politicians  to make this country  a great place 
[00:18:00]  for everybody.  Sorry  all the little turtles  don't make it to the sea  as Opie used to say.  Hey!  That's my thing!  I credited you  god damn it.  Oh yeah you did.  Alright cool.  Jesus Christ  it's not  friggin Russia.  Alright I hear what you're saying.  You rise  to the sea  to the sea  I hear what you're saying.  I broke into another speech.  I hear what you're saying  and that's why we need Obama  to tear down the  current system.  Oh Jesus no.  Yes because the old way  is not working anymore  so we need a young  socialism.  A young 
[00:18:30]  pop icon  to tear down the system.  Pop icon?  Yes he's a pop culture icon.  Daugherty.  Put Daugherty in there.  Who?  Daugherty.  American Idol.  Daugherty?  Daugherty.  I thought you would have  went with Hannah Montana.  Yes put Hannah Montana  in office.  Elect Hannah Montana.  We need a young guy  with some new ideas.  Anthony's an ass.

[00:24:30]  people's guns  They love taking  people's guns  Have you  looked in the mirror  lately  What  You need your guns  taken away  No I don't  I'm a responsible  gun owner  If you look in  YouTube  you see me at the  range  firing guns  very responsibly  I haven't really  brought this up  on the show  but I have checked  out your videos  On YouTube  Yes  And there's a look  in your eye  that scares me  a little bit  Did it scare you  Yes  Was it my smirky smile  Yes  There's something  going on in there 
[00:25:00]  And then when I  unloaded  They got a padded cell  right next to Brittany  waiting for you  No  There's something  going on with you  Mr. Kumya  No  Don't take my guns  Alright we gotta  take a break  We can continue  with this  A break  The phones are lit  877-212-018  You know like a tax break  Oh  You know  Okay you calmed me down  I like those  Which McCain voted against  by the way  Hey just leave it the way it is  McCain voted against  a tax break  Look I paid through the nose  but I'm willing  You know I'm a good egg  when it comes to that  I'll give my share 
[00:25:30]  but just don't keep  reaching into my pocket  and not to give people  something they feel  they're entitled to  Sorry  It's not the United States  of guaranteed prosperity  What candidate's going to  help the little guy?

No one heard the last  ten minutes of you  ranting  We were in commercials  Relax  We're back with  the O.P. and Anthony show  Come on!  Come on!  Come on everybody!  Come on!  Well  We only played  the first Hillary clip  Here's the second one 
[00:29:00]  She was excited  about her showing  yesterday  on Super Tuesday  and she talked  to some people  She's done though  Yeah  The momentum  is going to  You think?  Yes  It's going to be Obama  and it's going to be McCain  and Obama  is going to  win  I just hope  that  goes hand in hand  with your prediction  of the Patriots victory  Yeah well  a lot of people  are starting to say that  and just like the Pats 
[00:29:30]  I was on the Obama train  very early  Yes yes you were  Here we go  Hillary's  little speech yesterday  Tonight  in record numbers  You voted  not just to make history  but to remake America  People in America  Samoa  Arkansas  Massachusetts  New Jersey  Oklahoma  Tennessee  and the great state  of New York  The great state 
[00:30:00]  of New York  She's screwed  You can just feel it  Really?  You can just feel it  out there  Yes  I don't know  You got to at least  agree that Obama  is going to get  the nominee  right?  The nominee  You know something?  I don't know  You really think Hillary  could pull this out?  I don't know  Pull it out  She's right there  She's actually  Well they're calling it  neck and neck  but they're saying Obama  did much better 
[00:30:30]  than they thought he would  on Super Tuesday  I don't think  He won more states  They thought he would  He won more states  but he didn't get  California or New York  and those are biggies  as far as delegates  Yeah  I learned a lot  He did exactly  What's great  What I thought he would do  What's great  You watch Wolf Blitzer  for an hour  and you feel like  you could go on CNN  and discuss this crap  Get on there  I don't think  they want me on there  I yell too much  We got Scott  from Hop Hog 
[00:31:00]  He writes  Rock around Barack  tonight  Come on  Let's go  Rock around Barack  Come on  We're going to rock  around Barack  Rock tonight  Come on  Come on  All day long  with that  That's why you gotta  linger longer man  You gotta get in  on the inside jokes here  I just  Want more  I don't like  The whole pitch  with Obama  is change  Gonna change  We need change  It's time for change  in America  Do we really want 
[00:31:30]  that much change  I say yes  Because we're going  down the road  to socialism  with all the change  I see that they  want to do  with every one  of these little things  and programs  That's what I see  It sounds great  How about this  You love going  to the casinos  and you love  going all in  right  Yeah  And that's  exciting right  Very exciting  I say America  goes all in  and let's see  what happens  This is all in  but what if we  get  I know we got  a two and a four 
[00:32:00]  offsuit  but let's do it  What if  someone sucks out  on the river  and we lose  Let's just think  in casino terms  Let's all  let's all get  together and go  all in  and say  all right  I'm with you  I don't want to  go all in  on this hand  Oh by the way  today's the day  where we  where we endorse  one of the candidates  Oh we do?  Yeah today's the day  because everyone else  is doing it  so  All right  Is this going to be  Now you look at  a couple  like Arnold  Schwarzenegger 
[00:32:30]  Well he was called  something else  last night  on the 10 o'clock  news here in New York  No they didn't  Oh yeah they did  Did they say  Schwarzenegger?  They said  Schwartz Wright  What?  They said  Schwartz Wright  They messed up  the second half  of his name  Yeah  How did they  do that?  Oh yeah  Oh yeah  And I want to  thank one of our  fine faithful listeners  for bringing it  to our attention  today on the  Instant Feedback  but I guess  someone said it  a little too fast  and they  Yeah  It was a biggie  Oh  How?  They got the 
[00:33:00]  first part right  Yeah  Let's just put it  that way  Oh God  All right  Hey  I don't think  that us  Is that a  I miss  I don't think  helping get  most people  health care  within reason  is socialism  You don't  Of course  I don't want  a redistribution  of wealth  It is  I think that  so much money  is wasted  that's where  the problem  is because  the insurance  companies  I don't trust  them  Like  they really  do have  people whose  whole job  it is to  make sure  that the  insurance  company  says no  to legitimate  requests  The pharmaceutical 
[00:33:30]  companies  I know it's  a free market  but they are  allowed to charge  anything they want  I mean  there's no balance  for them to have  to  If that was  their plan  Jimmy  I would be  all for it  Well do you  take that  I don't think  there's any  pill on the  face of this  earth  where a  prescription  is worth  $500  for a bottle  of pills  It's ridiculous  Things like that  The insurance  premiums  from these  insurance  companies  for health  care  is ridiculous  Every few 
[00:34:00]  months  my bill  goes up  for health  insurance  and you just  pay it  because what  are you going  to do  You can shop  around  do other  things  but the bottom  line is  it's going  to keep  going up  If they put  those things  You can't shop  around  They're all  the same  They're pretty  much  I mean  you do  agree  that health  care is  really  It is  If you  could fix  that problem  instead of  I know  what these  that's too  hard  We've always  talked about  how the  politicians  don't want  to address  or tackle  hard problems  The easier  thing to do  is tax  the crap 
[00:34:30]  out of people  that they  label wealthy  and then  give it all  to the  people they  label poor  and everyone  has health  care  What  It's insanity  They won't get  that  Fix the  problem  We will  What  Bill Clinton  couldn't do  that  No  So they're  not going  to get  all that  done  but we  should do  something  Bill Clinton  also had  a Republican  Congress  to deal  with  If there's  a Democratic  Congress  and a Democrat  in the White  House  Communism 
[00:35:00]  Well you  better move  then sir  Communism  Let's rework  some more  rock songs  because I'm  starting to  like this  Barack  around  the  clock  thing  Come on  Come on  Barack  Oh I was  saying Arnold  Schwarzenegger  and Maria  Shriver  there  are split  They're split  on their  endorsements  Not really  Yeah they are  She's going  for Barack  And Schwarzenegger  Schwarzenegger's  going for McCain  I thought he  What  She's a  candidate  Yeah  She's  No I  understand  all that  but I  thought  No  Schwarzenegger  is McCain  I thought they  were both  No 
[00:35:30]  Wow  No  He won't  go Democrat  like that  So he's McCain  and I think  we're a little  split in here  too  Just off the  top of my head  without even  really doing  a poll  I think we're  split  Well I want  Ron Paul  Jimmy wants  Ron Paul  I want Hillary  Some posters  of him up on  the expressway  driving home  yesterday  I got a chuckle  Yeah well  It's like  Google Ron Paul  learn the truth  Yeah 
[00:36:00]  Okay  Alright well  whatever  Hey um  this song  I think it  sucks  but uh  and I like  Obama  Obama  This thing's  all over YouTube  Get to the chopper  Getting a lot of  hits  a lot of views  It's a song  called Yes We Can  It's an Obama  remix  What they're doing  is uh  they took one  of his speeches  and they put it  to music  and they got like  famous celebrities  kind of reciting  the speech  along with Obama  And it's kind of  hard to understand  But people are 
[00:36:30]  loving this thing  for some reason  It's called  Yes We Can  Just a little taste  Should be called  Yes We Can  if Frank Sinatra  says so  Wait a minute  Spinal tap  Thank you  Cutthroat  He writes  What the F  happened to  Hawaii  America  Samoa  Hillary did  say America  Samoa  American Samoa  What is that  Hawaii  What  They don't like 
[00:37:00]  calling it that  anymore  Hawaii  What is that  about  I have no idea  Are you kidding  Yeah  I love when I  learn something  new  I'm not sure  but it could  be  Was Hawaii  one of the  states  on Super Tuesday  Did that idiot  politically correct up  the word Hawaii  Hawaii  Wait a minute  because I heard  America Samoa  and I'm like  alright  something I just  don't know  anything about  but that's what  she said  instead of  Hawaii  It's an  American territory  That's what  Bill from  Waterford is  saying  American Samoa 
[00:37:30]  Where is that  Oh it's given  in Hawaii  Okay  Where is that  Oh it's like  out there  in the Pacific  Islands  One of those  that we stole  from certain  people that  bombed us  years ago  Alright here's  Obama  Yes we can  Now have an  open mind  Anthony  Tell me what  you think  Yes Steve  from Bayshore  That's what I  meant  It was a creed  written into  the founding  documents  that declared  the destiny 
[00:38:00]  of the nation  Yes we can  It was whispered  by slaves  and abolitionists  as they blazed  the trail  toward freedom  Yes we can  Yes we can  Shut up  Shut up  Shut up  I think  I'm going to  the distant shore  flying high  and push westward  Mishmash  Stop it  Stop whining  It's hard to  understand what  is going on  in that song  Stop whining  See Arnold 
[00:38:30]  doesn't endorse him  He's mocking him  as he's trying  to sing his song  We'll put the  whole video up  on onaradio.com  but they're  starting to talk  about this thing  This Yes We Can  speech he made  was pretty damn  good though man  Come on  Way better than  Hillary  Obama let's do  the Yes We Can  speech  Come on  Come on  Yes We Can  Yes We Can  Yes We Can  He won 13  out of 22  states last night 
[00:39:00]  Good  Yeah  Good  Yeah  I like him  better than her  yes  I like him  way better  than her  McCain  2008  my friend  Dude  he's got  dandruff  on his suit  I don't care  about a president  with dandruff  and weird arms  That's fine  Those arms  snapped in 83  places  I hope that's  not the reason  he has weird arms  because then I'm  going to feel bad  but he's got  short arms  I think they are  and you can tell  he's got dandruff  on his suit  they just beat  the crap out of him  every day 
[00:39:30]  pretty much  but if he can't  even like  take care of  his own suits  then you know  I don't want him  to be president  I think differently  you know  a little president  named FDR  was wheelchair bound  and he did a bang up job  my friend  you know  during the war  I didn't like some  of his social programs  either  his Budinsky wife  what did she do  she was always  you know  palling around  with those people  it's actually 
[00:40:00]  from an  all in the family  episode  we got Josie  Josie's on the line  from Long Island  Josie  yeah  you're a young  black woman  yes  yeah but how  black are you  fully  like Josie  like how  like  like  like remember  that Caribbean  chick from yesterday  yes  practically my mom  okay  oh very nice  I saw a black girl  yesterday  crossing the street  I was going 
[00:40:30]  the other way  so we pass each other  and she was really hot  you know  really hot  and real dark  and every so often  I get this  I get this  not really a fantasy  it's this thought  in my head  of God  and I get this thought  like  I wonder  how much  my family  would freak out  and my grandma  if I brought her over  to like Christmas dinner  and she said hi  and walked in the house  laughing on the air  because I snort  when I laugh  and that's the last 
[00:41:00]  thing I want to be  oh  you like to snort  when you laugh  a snorter  what do you got Josie  I completely agree  with Anthony  oh  do you  like  I'll be honest  I've had a hard life  when I was 16  I got pulled out  of my mom's house  and at that time  yeah  I did the food stamps  thing  but as soon as I was 18  over and done with  did what I needed to  you got yourself  a job  you got yourself  a pimp  yeah exactly  I went to school  I did what I needed to do  and I lived my life 
[00:41:30]  yeah  and that's the problem  you know  in FDR  he put all these  social programs in  but they keep forgetting  it was short term  yep  not meant to be forever  well they never  they never take away  and put things back  the way they were  when they say short term  like that  whether it's tolls  or  these social programs  or putting clothes on  you know  strippers  things like that  yeah  yeah  you know  what they should be focusing on  instead of trying to put  more money out of our pockets  is instead like 
[00:42:00]  reallocating the budget  like putting it where  it needs to be  you know  stop the cycle  of  deadbeat parents  having kids  who just become deadbeats  and keep taxing on us  I like this girl  I agree with you  there's just something wrong  with the fact  that people in our country  can't get medical care  it just annoys me  that Americans  we waste so much money  on crap  and that's a legitimate thing  and I'm not talking about  people on welfare  who are doing nothing 
[00:42:30]  who are sucking the system  dry with abortion  I don't mean that  I'm talking about people  that legitimately work  just don't make enough money  and can't get care  because the insurance companies  are vultures  well you know what then  true change in Washington  would be  true change  not tax and spend  democrat crap  business as usual  true change  tackle some of these  issues with  the healthcare providers  with the pharmaceutical companies  with the American government  the way it is  with its  irresponsible spending 
[00:43:00]  and take all that revenue  and use that  to help  the people  instead of  taxing the crap  out of everybody  again  and having  that money  go to where  it's not supposed to go  why take more money  out of our pockets  so some fat chick  down the street  who has three kids  at the age of  like 22  can like  beat herself  thank you  you know what  open up  how about  a state  dance in love  dance in love  Josie's great  I got jungle fever 
[00:43:30]  now because of Josie  now all we have to do  is bleach you  but dance  no  no bleaching  dance very in love  see I'm not judging her  on the color of her skin  I'm judging her  on the content  of her character  are you  and I like the content  of her character  if we were on TV  this would be  a different interview  it would not  if you were able  to see her  where are you  wine dance  or Brentwood  that would be  black neighborhoods  for the rest of America  she's from Long Island  yeah what part  of Long Island  Bellport 
[00:44:00]  Bellport  well  you're on  you're on the border  let's be honest  there's the good part  and the bad part  that's true  mostly white  and the bad part  is basically  black and Latino  all right  Josie we gotta go  cause we're heading  toward a break here  but thank you so much  thank you  look at that  endorsement  listen to you  all the time  and Anthony  don't listen to anything  that these ignorant  pillow biting  wookies  wanna say  thank you Josie

[00:50:00]  hope you guys  caught that  that was very mellow  but she got a little  potty mouth  doesn't she  unfortunately  the reason why  the bit  doesn't really work  that well  is because  the person  being woken up  always has to curse  they have to curse  of course  because just think  if this was happening  in your life  the first word  out of your mouth  would be  yeah  hitting me  yeah  good job  Genaro  good morning

[00:51:30]  no  Bob Kelly  in the fourth quarter  of a Patriots  so we got  wow that's  hmm  they're usually  not the obvious  like it sounds like  somebody being hacked  apart  right  but it's probably  something silly  it's someone videotaping  something  because I think  the person laughing  is videotaping  yes  oh  very good Jimmy  Jimmy's on to  something there  you see your  forensic expertise 
[00:52:00]  you could hear  screaming  and then all of a  sudden  a laugh  you shouldn't have  heard laughter  in the middle  of screaming  Sam  it obviously  was the person  with the camera  do you think  it's some kind  of  Anthony's afraid  that blackness  is contagious  it's not  Sam  you're born with it  or you're not  does it sound like  that person was in  some kind of  distress  alive  dead  do you think  it was natural  causes 
[00:52:30]  what did that  sound like  I don't know  I can't tell  because of the  80 decibel  song coming to  my head  sounds of one  thing  I'm gonna be  deaf  and you're  gonna be  accused of  murder  Jim C  I love Jim C  can't get enough  of Jim C  with his  flat ass  girlfriend  I know  turn the music  louder  they can't hear  it Sam  well  get your tiny  genitals away  stop with the 
[00:53:00]  magnifying glass  underwear  you're not  fooling anyone  Jim C  Jim C's a  five line pony  I love him  though  those five lines  are gold  I was thinking  of Jimmy  yesterday  I think it  was on TMZ  they had a  little audio  of 50 Cent  and he said  there's only one  celebrity out there  that would make  him very very  nervous  or has made  him nervous  whatever  and that would  be Robert  De Niro  really  yeah  good old  Bobby De Niro  and it just 
[00:53:30]  made me laugh  because I was  thinking of  Jimmy's  De Niro  impression  do we have  De Niro's  speech that he  made  he made  like a  little speech  about backing  Obama  yeah where is that  we asked that  do we have that  do we  because  from what I hear  I haven't heard it  but from what I hear  it is exactly  as Jimmy  describes him  I want to hear that  because  now that I know  he's afraid of 50 Cent  that's even funnier  and they say  50 Cent  is worried  about me  I'll give you 
[00:54:00]  a buck  fidgeting papers  stupid  all tentative  with his talking  awful jokes  it's just  horrid jokes  based on his  movies  yeah  do we have  an audio  fantastic  what  well  let me see  I look  on foundry  Steve is just  wandering  you alright  what are you  doing  no  we did not  play it  yesterday  I like your  shirt Steve 
[00:54:30]  looks like  the big bird  of foundry  crapped on  your shoulder  alright  get out  put your  big logo  go find the  De Niro audio  please  for the love  of god  executive producer  please  Jesse in Jersey  what's up  he had a stomach  stapled  go ahead Jesse  hey I just  wanted to guess  the sound  hey Anthony  does that  happen to be  your liver  my liver  yeah that's 
[00:55:00]  Anthony's liver  realizing  realizing it's  Friday  the weekend  coming  it's only  Wednesday  but  Friday's around  the corner  it's a taped  piece  of course  I wasn't trying  to be accurate  oh I didn't want  people thinking  this was a best of  oh okay  hey uh  could they  that would mean  we're actually  doing radio  doing something  that would be  considered the  best  we'll figure out 
[00:55:30]  guess the sound  later  um  we're gonna  change uh  change gears  slightly  we're starting  like an eighth  gear  yeah  we're starting  to like wrestling  again  a little bit  yeah yeah  a little bit  a little bit  back in the day  we definitely  enjoyed it  because Vince  McMahon was out  of his mind  and the storylines  were just insane  very edgy  yeah  and then uh  it got a bit  PC after the  Janet Jackson  thing  you know  he had to  save his company  but he's slowly  but surely  getting back  into what he  knows how to  do  I think it was  mostly also  they just  pretty much 
[00:56:00]  focused on the  wrestling for  quite a while  and you know  to me that  wasn't what  it was all  about  it's about  the storylines  that are so  ridiculous  yeah  and Vince  just being  a horse's ass  yeah  it's that  kind of stuff  that brings  you in  and they're  getting back  to that  which is  great  I gotta  back up  slightly  we got  Steve in  Boston  he wants  to play  guest of  sound  Steve go  ahead  hi  is it  that kid  who runs  the 200  meter  screaming  the entire  way  Steve  yeah it  is 
[00:56:30]  is it  thanks for  ruining the  bit  yes  Steve do  you understand  what this  bit's about  hmm  would anyone  care what  the real  answer is  not  isn't it  fun to  come up  with like  goofy  answers  goofy  answers  about  I don't  know  is that  the first  time  someone's  guest  though  yeah  that's  what I'm  saying  Steve  wrecked it  for everybody  see all  the phones  are lit  with silly  answers  now we  can't do  silly  answers  because  you  decided  everyone  needed 
[00:57:00]  to know  the right  answer  thanks  Steve  well  I'm  a douche  enjoy  your  day  good  bye  look at  that  somebody  wanted to  say a  woman in  a  restroom  standing  in  something  that  looks  like  spilled  jello  we could  have went  with silly  answers  we don't  give a crap  what the  real answer  is when  we do  this bit  let me  make sure  I understand  we're mad  at that  guy  giving the  real answer  when the  bit is  called  and we're  mad because  he spoiled  a miscarriage 
[00:57:30]  joke  this is a  repugnant  radio show  we are  awful  hey man  but if you  linger longer  you understand  we don't  really want  the real  answer  there's no  fun in  that  clarify  that's all  you know  you get  Britney Spears  in the hospital  coming in  chopper pilot  crashing  Eric waking  up late  again  I mean  all fun  silly  answers  all right  enough  so anyway  Vince McMahon  now the  other thing  with Vince 
[00:58:00]  McMahon  and the  WWE  we are  convinced  that  Vince  is now  doing  Anthony's  impression  of Vince  McMahon  yeah  yeah  the one  where he  barely gets  words out  anymore  no chance  in here  we heard  him do  that a  couple  of times  and  the  WWE  has  requested  the  Anthony  Vince  McMahon  impression  so we're  honored  by the  way  honored  sending  off audio 
[00:58:30]  all the  time  and we  noticed  that  Vince  McMahon's  like  whole  whole  like  whole  what  personality  has  changed  how he  speaks  has  changed  and it  sounds  a lot  more  like  Anthony  doing  Vince  McMahon  and we  got some  audio  that  a lot  of the  listeners  turned us  on to  and Sam  caught up  last night  Vince McMahon  tries to get  Hornswoggle  to join his  kiss my ass  club  one of our  favorite  I loved  that bit  the Vince  kiss my  ass  club 
[00:59:00]  kiss my  ass  and  the people  that do  linger longer  you're going  to hear a  lot of  Anthony  in this  Vince  right here  I'm going  to ask  all the  kids in  this arena  to stand  up and  be recognized  here we  go  look at  him  and you  know what  every single  one of  these kids  is a  spoiled  brat  don't be 
[00:59:30]  booing me  you make  them spoiled  brats  you did  that's on  you  that's on  you  that's  Anthony  he's just  yelling  he definitely  got excited  in the ring  and yelled  a little bit  but he  has definitely  changed  that's right  you're all  spoiled  brats  that's right  it's all  about you  kiss my 
[01:00:00]  ass  the kiss  my ass  club  the hell  is that  exclusive  can I  go  backwards  again  because  someone  on  instant  feedback  doesn't  get it  see  there's  many  layers  I hate  to say  this today  but there's  many layers  to my  genius  many layers  like an  onion  someone  on  instant  feedback  Opie  why  did  you  take  the  call  stop  bitching  that 
[01:00:30]  was  another  layer  of my  genius  I knew  exactly  what I  was doing  there  you  dope  why'd  you  take  the  call  why'd  you  take  the  call  then  see  that  was  today's  bit  where  I  wanted  to  make  the  guy  uncomfortable  because  he  was  guessing  the  right  answer  and  scene  right  you  idiot  and  punk  I  mean  just  listen  my  acting  sucks  of  course  I  knew  the  guy  was  going  to  give  the  right  answer  how  dare  you  the  whole  bit 
[01:01:00]  was  to  make  the  guy  uncomfortable  for  doing  the  right  thing  and  guessing  the  sound  your  acting  really  was  awful  sir  this  is  the  bit  you  were  raising  the  hand  at  the  wrong  time  gesticulating  after  you  were  done  talking  you  put  that  up  while  you  were  talking  and  so  see  another  great  answer  Scott  asked  from  Quakertown  guess  the  sound  you  know  that  screaming  yeah  this  person 
[01:01:30]  right  well  Scott  writes  is that  Lily  leaving  Ant's  house  after  paying  off  her  bet  oh  her  Super  Bowl  bet  yes  when  is  that  happening  I  think  she's  busy  this  weekend  but  probably  next  weekend  for  the  people  that  are  too  lazy  to  linger  longer  Anthony  won  a  Super Bowl  bet  and  he  gets  Lily  from  the  Ron  and  Fez  show  to  sleep  over  yeah  the  lovely  Lily  is  coming  over  to  my  house  and  she's  got to  spend  the  night  it's  like a  horror  movie  you gotta 
[01:02:00]  survive  24 hours  in my  house  is that  Valentine's  Day  weekend  or no  oh  it might  be  that's  good  that's  a healthy  loving  atmosphere  for Lily  to  world  war  two  loving  gun  nut  that's  very  romantic  guns  and  alcoholism  he's  gonna  give  you  a  swastika  with  chocolate  in it  yeah  wonderful  or swastika  if I  could say  the word  right now  40  I'm  with you  Jimmy  I'm  with you  yeah  that's  a great  idea  what  thought  of that  little

[01:07:00]  yeah  all right  it's  Opie and  Anthony  man we  have lots  to do  still  now yesterday  we hit the  streets of  New York  City  and we  talked a  lot of  black people  to see who  they were  voting for  yes  and I  believe it  was six  out of the  seven said  Obama  and one  person said  Clinton  and they  didn't even  acknowledge  Republicans  no  no  they didn't  even acknowledge  we forgot to  talk about  that 
[01:07:30]  yesterday  well today  we have  white people  on the street  and who  they're voting  for  all right  we're going  to get to  that in a  little bit  but we  got to get  back to  the Vince  McMahon  thing  so where  were we  Vince was  getting his  ass  buffed  professionally  and he  had addressed  the crowd  of children  in the audience  and told the  parents that  the only way  to really  discipline the  children  is  and treat  them as  to have  them kiss 
[01:08:00]  your ass  as a parent  right  and I  gather now  that his  illegitimate  son  what's his  name  Hornswoggle  Hornswoggle  now will  have to kiss  Vince's ass  as an example  is that what  I'm led to  believe  yeah well  it's all  about  tough love  tough love  and if  anyone can  give tough  love  it's Vince  McMahon  is this a  lesson to  other parents  it's a lesson  yeah to both  Hornswoggle  and to other  parents  and we're  flattered  because it's  very obvious 
[01:08:30]  that Vince  is now  doing  Angry Vince  Angry Vince  Anthony's  impression  but he's  Vince McMahon  so why would  he do someone  else's impression  of himself  I'm really  confused  I love this  Vince  he's just  upped it a bit  yeah  he cranked it up  he's always been  like this  but he went  the exaggerated  route  which I really  like  yeah  because Anthony  really threw  it over the top  with his  impression  where you know  he doesn't  finish words  and all that  and now he's  not finishing  words  he's really  angry  look at his  face  that picture's 
[01:09:00]  great  he's just  amazing  he's such  an ass  I love him  I wish he was  my dad  he plays it  perfect  it's the  ass buffer  look at  him buffing  his  he's a  grown man  his pants  are down  you can go  to YouTube  do we have  this audio  it's like an  auto buffer  Sam get the  audio of him  getting buffed  it's gotta be  hilarious  okay

[01:13:00]  Vince  absolutely  the music  starting  was very  funny  yeah  the little  leprechaun  music  okay  see wrestling  I'm not a  wrestling fan  but it's  like ever  since they  kind of  admitted like  all right  we all  know what  it is  and just  got silly  and ridiculous  sports  entertainment  yeah  it's fun  we got  uh  dinero  endorsing  obama  oh thank  god  you get  it  very  pizzazz  filled  yeah  a personality 
[01:13:30]  to this  yeah  sure it's  boring  I don't  want to do  it before  he does  it  because  then I'll  probably  be totally  wrong  humiliated  you wanted  to vote  you just  didn't have  anyone you  wanted to  vote for  well  you know  what  I felt  the same  I felt  the same  until now  with youth 
[01:14:00]  leading the way  we are answering  barack obama's  call  it is a call  to action  can you pause  it for one  second  just a correction  bob  you are  wonderful  but you  don't say  with youth  leading the way  we  as if you  are one  of these  you did a  movie called  bang the drum  slowly  when I was  one  this sounds  very  different  doesn't sound  as scary  no  action  it is a 
[01:14:30]  call  to take  back  our  government  it is  a call  for change  we can  believe in  they can't  they don't even  know when to  applaud  a call  to band  together  all of us  to elect  the next  president  of the  united  states  barack  obama  all right  it wasn't  that bad  but there's  no pizzazz  in there  whatsoever  the people  don't even  know when  to start  applauding  because  he's just  like  yeah  usually  there's a lot  more energy  when that 
[01:15:00]  goes down  right  a call  to  call  to  arms  everybody  has to  elect  this  guy  excuse me  could you  act  how about  this  do  Jake  LaMotta  endorsing him  yeah  just grab  one of your  characters  yeah or  do Jimmy  Conaway  and then  choke Hillary  with a  phone cord  while you  introduce him  all right  super  tuesday  was yesterday  we sent  one of our  guys out  on to  the street  and his  job was to  talk to white  people to see  who they're 
[01:15:30]  voting for  now yesterday  well actually  if I could just  comment on  something that  we just  listened to  De Niro  I think it'd  be funny if  some guy  walked in  as he's  giving his  speech and  goes  hey  some  just stole  the election  so I  think it's  going to  be a lot  of Republican  you know  stuff here  right  yes  probably  we talked  to a lot  of white  people yesterday  on the  streets  and  do we  have 
[01:16:00]  whitey's  age  and stuff  I'm  hoping  yeah  we meet  Rabbi  Weintraub  whoa  that's not  going to  be a  Republican  Simcha  Weintraub  from Brooklyn  New York  how old  are you  sir  54  54  what do  you do  for a  living  I'm a  rabbi  and a  social worker  didn't he  say I'm  rabbi  so why  would you  yeah  who the  all right  I'm a  rabbi  and a  bartender  54 year  old  rabbi  who's he  voting for  um  Jewish 
[01:16:30]  guilt  I'm  guessing  Hillary  but then  yeah I  would say  Hillary  he's probably  liberal but he's  probably from  Crown Heights  we all  got a little  bit of strife  there  yeah  yeah  I'm voting  for Barack  Obama  wow  wow  because I  see  his  him as a  man of  integrity  with a lot  of good  ideas and  possibility for  real change  here  all right  there you go  anything else  with the  rabbi  no the 
[01:17:00]  good rabbi  threw me for a  loop there  okay  let's meet  Charlie  from New York  City my name  is Charles  Welch  Charles how  old are you  I'm 67  what do you  do for a  litter  brick lamb  what does  he do  bake lamb  oh brick  layer  oh brick  layer  oh he's  McCain  he's voting  for McCain  McCain all  the way  yeah  what do you  think  Hillary  oh any  particular reason  why  she's for the  union she's for  the people  oh okay 
[01:17:30]  you're a union  man  yep  how long  you've been  in the union  1955  it's a long  time  got that  right  I'm not  1,955  years  yep  we're 19  minutes 55  seconds  he's joined  he was a  scab all his  life  now he's all  dedicated  yeah now he's  got his car  they made him  wait  yeah a lot  of those union  guys will  probably go  for Hillary  because they're  probably like  I don't know  if he wants  a black  president but  they got to  go with  the democrat  let me hear  the last  part of that  clip  1955  it's a long  time  got that 
[01:18:00]  right  I'm not  interested in  anybody  but Hillary  wow  it's so weird  just in general  people are  talking less  about the  republican  you know  candidates  it is  New York  too  let's  let's  be honest  here  all right  next we meet  David  these are all  white people  by the way  David Johnson  from Westchester  all right  what do you do  for a living  lawyer  lawyer  Hillary  um  I don't 
[01:18:30]  know  who's  for the  reforms  for  tort reform  and stuff  like that  um  yeah maybe  you're right  I'd say  Hillary  yeah she's  a lawyer  yeah okay  uh  Obama  why is that  batting a thousand  because he's  right he is  changed and  everyone else  has been around  the block  a few too  many times  as far as  I'm concerned  I don't like  the block  they're on  anymore  nice analogy  shut up  up a bus  jumps the curb  on that block  and runs you  over

[01:32:00]  in a big  storm  and the  sun's shining  outside their  window  they're driving  the car  the windshield's  broken  it's not  broken  yeah  they got a lot  of bad  continuity  in there  terribly edited  right  yeah  yeah  someone is  yelling at  you  blue healer  f5  f5  category  is a hurricane  you effing  oh f5  yeah  I knew  I knew  I had  it wrong  but I  wasn't  going to  stop there  and start  stuttering  over  what is  it  what is  it  an f5  or something  yeah  you get  the point  right  f5  hey  sorry

[01:33:30]  the sound  that had  come out  of him  so they  were able  to laugh  yeah  it wasn't  like  they were  chasing  some guy  down  who's the  guy going  tase it  he wanted  to be  tased  yeah  it's all  in Spanish  so I don't  really know  what they're  talking about  but yeah  apparently  one guy  was holding  him on  one arm  one guy  was holding  him on  the other  arm  so he  wouldn't  fall down  so I  think  they were  just  testing  the power  of this  specific  tase it  yeah  do you  have video  of that  yeah  yeah  it's up  on break  and we'll  throw it  up on  onaradio.com  later  too  you know

[01:49:00]  yeah  yeah we got  sisters  we every line  stinks  every line  why hasn't anyone  really acknowledged  how bad this movie  is except for us  like it's we're  obsessed with  obsessed with  how awful it is  they have a million  catchphrases  stupid nicknames  that whole bad  extreme thing  andrew in chicago  no one acts like  this in real life  is what it is  there's no reality  whatsoever in how  these people are  acting 
[01:49:30]  let's go to  andrew  andrew  hey what's up  hey kid  yeah just call  about that stupid  line where uh  he was uh  called before  saying where he  got naked  phil paxton was  naked and went  out to the tornado  because he said  he was drunk  jack daniels  and he threw  the bottle  and the great  ooh thing was  that the bottle  never touched  the ground  didn't dusty  tell that story  though  yeah  yeah dusty  was like  because dusty  was just all  over bill paxton's  junk  right 
[01:50:00]  oh he was in  love with him  yeah  so paxton was  drunk and naked  and threw the  bottle  yeah man  and the bottle  never touched  the ground  that's how close  he was man  extreme  yeah the movie  was huge  it made a  boatload of  money  and everyone  was talking about  it and the effects  and everything  for the time  everyone was like  oh did you see  the tornado  it looked great  but it was  horrible  horrid movie 
[01:50:30]  that I will watch  every single  time it's on  let's get some  real clips  in the coming  days  alright Steve  Sam's going  through it  right now  actually  let's say  hi to Ryan  in South Dakota  Ryan  hey boys  hey man  just wanted  to tell Jimmy  about their  fake little  love relationship  that Bill  and Helen Hunt  have  they rekindle  and he loses  his wife over  chasing tornadoes  yeah  yeah he just  came there  to like get  the divorce  papers finalized  with Helen Hunt 
[01:51:00]  who was still  a tornado  chaser  and he ends  up being like  you know  I think  trying to be  a weatherman  or some  crap like that  and he got  a fiance  and that's  all he's doing  but he gets  so into it  like cause  right when  he's ready  to sign the  papers  or she's ready  to sign the  papers  they see like  the tornadoes  are coming  and she's like  you wanna go  yeah man  cause he's got  in his blood  man  he's extreme  tornadoes  in his blood  so he takes  off and the  wife you know  his new fiance  has nothing  in common  with him  whatsoever 
[01:51:30]  who by the  way is way  hotter than  Helen Hunt  it was  what's her  name from  um  I don't find  her hot  I don't find  either of them  hot  Wendy Jo  Sperber  Wendy Jo  Sperber  Jamie Gertz  something like  right  Jamie Gertz  Helen Hunt  wasn't hot  since roller  coaster  I think she  was 10 in it  thank you  10 year old  joke  so wait  what did Helen Hunt  want to do with  this storm  why don't she  just lay on her  back with her  legs open  and hope it  touched down  properly  well she was 
[01:52:00]  obsessed because  of course when she  was younger  her father  had taken them  into the little  fruit cellar  when the tornado  was coming  when they were  younger  and he couldn't  get the door  down  and he flew  away and died  so the father  died so she  just became  obsessed  so why didn't  she just move  to Maine  at that point  exactly  you know what  he was killed  by though  right  what  an F5  finger of god 
[01:52:30]  you gotta warn us  before you say that  Dan  my god  wow  finger of Steve  it looks like it  has chocolate on it  let's say hi to  Chris in Virginia  Chris  F5  a foundry  five  on the foundry  scale  that's right  there's a big  logo  circling  wow  I want to thank  Irock  for going to  Irock  what is that  Mr. Skin 
[01:53:00]  and we're looking  at Helen Hunt  topless  from a movie  called The Water  Dance  1992  and she's got  a nice little  teardrop  little movie  called The Water  Dance  1992  written  she's got a nice  teardrop  happening  let's say hi  to Chris  yes Chris  she might be  porkable  from the back  she looks like  Javier Bardem  with that stupid  hairdo  Chris  hey  best line  from that movie  is  where's my truck  and then you see it  you know  fall onto  the road 
[01:53:30]  yeah  yeah  the truck  was lifted  in the air  and they couldn't  find it  it was my truck  and it falls  right in front  of them  we'll continue  with more drama  we'll continue  with the twister  stuff after the break  and Vinnie Brandt  joins the program  yes he does  great  the owner of  the stress factory  in New Brunswick  New Jersey  and yes he is  what  I'm disagreeing  with you  the owner  oh  you got Opie  you got Anthony  you got Jim Norton  and you got Vinnie Brandt 
[01:54:00]  from the stress factory  nice  all  very much so  doing the Opie  and Anthony show  you gotta say  what you said  during the live break  for New York  Vinnie just did  his own live read  for the stress factory  in New Brunswick  New Jersey  the rest of the country  doesn't really hear  those live reads  obviously  right  and you were  explaining  you were a little  confused right  yeah because  before you used  to talk about me  very nicely  yeah  right  and then  and I was like  alright I have  no money  I can't advertise  on your show  but as your  numbers went down  and advertising  became cheaper  I was able 
[01:54:30]  I was able  to jump on board  and throw my support  and then  what a dick  I love it  that's funny  and as soon as I did  you start really  dumping on my bed  which cracks me up  because  now I can't not pay for it  because now I think  you won't talk about me  at all  which is terrible  a couple weeks ago  Norton called me  done with a box of rocks  and seconds later  my hand rep called  and said I need more money  do you know how many  emails I got  from box of rocks  complaining  about the association 
[01:55:00]  so yeah Vinny's like  oh these guys  talk nicely  about my club  and all  I'm gonna start advertising  and then he advertised  and we just beat him up  well Vinny's a good comic too  we always tease him  but he's actually  a really good stand up  yeah  very very good  good lighter  conservative guy  and this too  we live on a 33 acre farm  in Oregon  it's a very special place  John  that sounds just like him  it's frightening  yeah here's what happens  I'll be standing out  in front of my club  talking  and I'll know that 
[01:55:30]  yeah when eight people  are in because  they literally just  stand there  and call me midget  you know Matt Roloff  midget  it's really hysterical  and people that don't  listen to the show  are always like  oh that's not nice  he's not that short  and they don't get it  they don't get  that you sound  just like the father  from little people  big world  we came out  everybody you know  thought faith  was an important value  to them  everybody thought  you know  family pride  was important  is that show  still on the air  I don't know  is it  yeah it got a little  messed up  because he was  caught drinking 
[01:56:00]  and driving  so they had a whole  trial and I think  they had to shut down  production for a while  while he's in the clink  I think he was found  innocent in the end  and I don't know  when the new episodes  start running  he probably had a bud nip  yeah one beer  a pony  .4 blood alcohol  I had a beer  my name is Matt Roloff  and this is my wife Amy  we're little people  when you're only four foot tall  you're feeling like  you're living in a world  that wasn't made for you  I feel like I'm on a radio show  that was not made for me  it's just amazing 
[01:56:30]  how close it is  after we're little people  how great would it be  if you just heard  a splat  yeah  we're little people  you were  alright enough about  Matt Roloff  but we got Vinnie Brent  in studio  and we just found  some twister lines  we gotta get more  yeah yeah definitely  we're obsessed with  how bad this movie is  I don't know why  it was put out  friggin years ago  10 years ago  12 years ago  and it's a perfect day  for this  because you know  you got the big tornado  that hit wherever it hit 
[01:57:00]  it's on CNN  45 people  it's up to 45 people  killed by the tornadoes  wow  there's five  so this is kind of perfect  that we're doing this today  so Twister  the awful Twister eclipse  here we go  we got a couple for today  we'll have more  hopefully tomorrow  listen to this Jimmy  this is especially for you  because you've never  seen the movie  turn him off  but we hope to change  all that  with a system  little set up  they're watching TV  and I believe  they're watching evil  storm chasers 
[01:57:30]  evil storm chasers  talking about  what they're  what they're gonna do  yeah  okay  turn him off  but we hope to change  all that  with a system  that I have devised  god he sucks  no  shut up  turn him off  what a wiener  he really is in love  with himself  I thought it was  just a summer thing  dude he's gonna  rue the day  he's gonna rue the day  he came up against  the extreme baby  there he is  bill I'm talking  imminent ruage 
[01:58:00]  imminent ruage  I was just wondering  why do you call  billy the extreme  cause billy  is the extreme  bill's the most  out of control  son of a bitch  in the game  wow they even  feel uncomfortable  doing that dialogue  yeah you can tell  you can hear in their  voices  it's horrid  how do we make  this sound real  is the extreme  why wouldn't you  just say no  I'm not gonna say  that  rewrite this 
[01:58:30]  in that movie  that movie was  huge right  oh it was massive  yeah  but it's one of  the worst written  things ever  and I've never  even seen it  just the lines  they're quoting  but he had to  say imminent ruage  like you'll be  rueing something  and why did he  just say  look you have  to rewrite that  I won't say it  you'll be filming  me sitting here  it's amazing  they made a  theme park ride  out of that movie  people's lives  getting destroyed  45 people dead  it sounds like  a good ride  let's open up  the holocaust ride  next  we always said  that about  the titanic slide 
[01:59:00]  at the kid parties  when they have that  it's like that's good  thousand some odd  people dead  in frozen waters  and now it's  just a kiddie ride  where they slide  down the deck  like real people  did  and go  banging off  of things  we this is fun  they bounce  off the plastic  you know  smokestack  yeah  it's fun for them  inflatable  smokestack  here's another  scene from  twister  and this loser  stumbles out of the  car  he's got like a  bottle of jack  daniels in his  hand  he's naked 
[01:59:30]  he is butt  naked  naked  not naked  he's without apparel  half naked  naked  so joe's yelling  at him to get  out of the way  right  so uh  he just  he strolls up  to the twister  and he says  have a drink  and he chucks  the bottle  into the twister  and it never  hits the ground  twister  caught it 
[02:00:00]  and sucked it  right off  honey this is a  tissue of lies  see there was  another bill  an evil bill  and i killed him  wow  what  what  god  oh jeez  okay  terrific  i don't believe  that that was  real dialogue  isn't that amazing  jimmy it's not  an outtake or  anything  our staff did  that 
[02:00:30]  and this movie  is  it's huge  and actually  rotten tomatoes  gave it 59%  positive reviews  what  or 59%  suckage  which one is it  who reviewed it  that's you  or hoffman  i think  59% suckage  okay  and finally  we have one more  back there's a  strong f2  here's the  the finger of god  that anthony  refers to  from time to time  jimmy  some of the worst  dialogue ever  watch them lose  their minds here  back there's a  strong f2 
[02:01:00]  f3 maybe  i bet we see  some f4s  that'd be sweet  four is good  four will relocate  your house  fairly efficiently  is there an f5  what would that be like  the finger of god  none of you have ever  seen a f5  just one of us 
[02:01:30]  just one of us  we are doomed  my back is tingling  isn't it uncomfortable  to listen to  the dropping of the fork  clang  they're just talking  about yeah  f4  what about f5  oh yeah  yeah  it's f5 too  that's like  you know  but no  it's like  f4  f5  now you've gone  too far  don't discuss  that  they could have  just made that 
[02:02:00]  movie with stuff  blowing around  that's all you  really wanted to  say is  crap get ripped  through the sky  and cows get  sucked up into  the hurricane  that was pretty  much it  the special  effects  that's what  made that movie  that's why  it did so well  because everybody  pushed the fact  that the special  effects were really  amazing for the time  I guess  let's go to  kevin in new york  kevin  hey what's up guys  you got the part  where he's uh  driving through the  house and just  before he hits it  we're going in  well the house  kind of if i  remember correctly  kind of rolls  across the roadway 
[02:02:30]  and it never really  breaks apart and  then they actually  drive right through  it yeah  up the stairs  out the back window  right exactly  let's go to  mitch in florida  mitch  i like the part  where they're  driving in a  small pickup truck  and a semi-truck  blows right behind  them  yeah yeah  big semi-truck  full of oil  with gas or  something  wouldn't that weigh  a bit more  yeah  yeah they're not  going anywhere  but the semi-truck  is blowing by  with cows and  crap around them  yeah exactly  that's the magic  of the twister  you could be  right next to it 
[02:03:00]  and something else  could get sucked up  but you could be  right there  that's the magic  you're extreme  yeah  dude  five  Matt in Jersey  Matt  dropped my stuff  pick your fork up  I dropped it  instead of five  hold on Matt  uh what  hello  Matt  you're on  go  I just want to  tell Vinny first  love your club  I'm there  but I want some  offense  thanks man  keep coming  another crappy  line from the movie  they're driving 
[02:03:30]  the new fiance  in the truck  and she's on the  phone with a client  and she's like  I gotta call you  back  we've got cows  according to  e-rock  494 million  471 thousand  524 dollars  worldwide  yeah  and that's  1996  dollars  and because you guys  are talking about it  today  it'll do more money  tomorrow  yeah  because people  will rent it  now  so I could just  watch it  and be embarrassed  it's so bad 
[02:04:00]  alright so we'll get  more twister lines  tomorrow  uh  Tim  Tim came up with  something called  rock like Barack  what  it's a  oh it's Tim  okay  it's a take off  on rock around  Barack  I thought you  were gonna  let's take a  listen to it  see what it's  all about  introducing the  new LP  from going  commie records  rock like  Barack  here's some of  the greatest  tunes of all

Of course, based on the Pearl Jam song, Rock Around Barack,  but it's not Eddie Vedder singing.  It's Stone Gossard on vocals.  1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 o'clock.

Steven S. from Bayshore.  He writes,  Holy crap, did a twister suck all the air from Vinny's lungs?  Take a breath, you miserable midget.  Miserable midget. 
[02:06:30]  I can't wait to buy more ads.  We're not gonna pay for that.  I've said it, you know, in a moment of weakness,  you've got a great club.  Yeah, I know.  You really do have a great club.  Oh, we think family values are important.  But that makes for boring radio.  It makes for boring radio.  But it's a great presentation down there  in New Brunswick, New Jersey.  You've not been in a long time.  You should have come and seen Bobby Kelly last week.  Well, I wanted to.  Last time I was down there, I saw Burr.  Burr sold out and killed,  and everyone had a great time.  Bobby did not sell out, 
[02:07:00]  but he did blow up quite a bit.  Quite a few of the paninis that he picked on.  Cracked me up,  because he looks like the snowman  from Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.  Every time I look at him,  I hear silver and gold.  It's just round with that round face.  He really has gotten very round, his head.  Yeah.  Even in the time we've known him.  Oh, my God.  Good thing he's not a criminal.  People would say,  what's his M.O.?  You mean his method of operation?  No, no.  His morbid obesity.  Funny, I love letter jokes.  That was a long, long way. 
[02:07:30]  That was a long way to go,  but anything with Bobby and morbid obesity is funny.  Hilarious.  Let's say hi to Eric in New York City.  Eric?  Guys, you haven't talked about my favorite scene yet.  It's the last scene when Bill Paxton and Helen Hunt  get trapped in the middle of the tornado,  so they take shelter in a building  and are clinging to a gas pipe  while the building gets shredded around them,  but somehow they're able to hold on with one hand.  What intrigue.  This sounds very exciting. 
[02:08:00]  Yes, very, very.  Yeah.  And people just tuning in  because he got Pat from Hackenstown.  He writes,  I didn't know you guys had Matt Roloff in studio today.  All right, we've done that.  Yes.  And he's just tuning in.  He wants me to ask you about the new season  of Little People and the DUI.  See?  I want to look Matt Roloff up.  Talk about it.  Prank call his house.  Order extra cable and pizzas.  Why don't we get him on the phone?  Can we not get him?  We tried?  I've tried.  I've told Roland I would love to talk to Matt Roloff. 
[02:08:30]  Does he have a little publicist?  He's a little publicist.  Oh, what, what?  Does he have a little publicist?  Big phone in his little hand.  Nice guy.  He's talking halfway into the thing  like his little mouth doesn't reach the receiver.  He's cute.  Do me a favor.  Just go, Vinnie Brandt, live here in studio.  Just go, I'm Matt Roloff, and this is my wife, Amy.  I'm Matt Roloff, and this is my wife, Amy.  Yeah, say it again, though.  Say it like you mean it.  I'm Matt Roloff, and this is my wife, Amy.  That's how I say it. 
[02:09:00]  My name is Matt Roloff, and this is my wife, Amy.  Play me back.  I want to hear it.  Well, just say it again.  All right.  Wait, what's the line?  My name is Matt Roloff, and this is my wife, Amy.  All right.  Say that.  My name is Matt Roloff, and this is my wife, Amy.  My name is Matt Roloff, and this is my wife, Amy.  Jesus.  It is so close.  It's really close.  It's really funny.  It is really scary.  You know, optimism was one of those goals.  I am extremely optimistic.  I mean, the glass for me is always not half full, but completely full. 
[02:09:30]  Even when it's not, it feels completely full.  That's funny.  Because you're a midget.  Exactly.  Shouldn't you have said that?  The tumbler's always half full.  It's got half of the DNA, too.  The clown car is half full.  With me, the shoes and pants are always half full.  The hat is always doubly full.  I don't know why God did that.  Oh, yes. 
[02:10:00]  Another suggestion coming in.  Could you go, I'm Paul R. Nelson?  Who, Paul?  Just go, I'm Paul R. Nelson.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  I don't know that one.  Yeah, but just do the line.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  And if he didn't decide that the show is over, we could have maybe played the real clip of  Paul R. Nelson.  Thanks to my ex.  I want to hear my voice back and back with Matt Roloff.  I want to hear it. 
[02:10:30]  It always makes me laugh.  Let's go to Sam in Charlotte.  Sam?  Hey, good morning, fellas.  Hey.  You guys forgot the best scene in the whole movie, where the not cool guys have Bish  McMahon in the car and be like, there it is.  It's a twister.  Vince has a storm chaser.  There it is.  We're chasing twisters today.  We're extreme.  We're going to get in a vehicle, blast my music, head down the highway, and find a tornado. 
[02:11:00]  That's right.  Find a tornado, and I'm going to show it my ass.  And what could that twister do, Vince?  It could kiss my ass.  Kiss your what, Vince?  My ass.  Hello, doctor.  I think I have a problem with my ass.  Your what?  My ass. 
[02:11:30]  I don't know what part of your body you're talking about, Vince.  My ass.  Joe, New York, what's going on, buddy?  Buffett.  Yeah.  Where's my ass cream?  I need a dollop.  A dollop.  He's great.  I think we're ending with you, Joe.  What do you got?  All right, well, you know that song, Brock, Brock, Brock, in on Heaven's Door.  All right. 
[02:12:00]  Good decision.  Vinny, thank you so much.  Thank you.  That was fun.  Thanks for doing seven minutes with us.  Seven minutes.  I'm sorry.  That's seven minutes.  I sat in the green room for 20 minutes.  Oh, God.  I didn't know you were here.  No, what happened, I actually went, I followed my GPS, which I hate because I know where West  57th is. 
[02:12:30]  But because I'm so dependent on the computer, I followed it to East 57th.  Let's not forget that Bobby Collins will be at the Stress Factory, what, tomorrow through  Sunday?  Oh, wait, let me, what?  Tomorrow through Sunday, yeah.  Okay, I turned your mic off.  I saw that.  Right in the middle of me talking.  And Ted Alexandro next week at the Stress Factory in New Brunswick, New Jersey.  All right.  And you're going to join us over at XM.  I'd like to.  We'll try to get you to curse.  I will.  You family values ass.  We're going to corrupt you. 
[02:13:00]  I guess that's it, right, Jimmy?  I think so.  I mean, I have a couple of thoughts I wanted to share if there's time.  Danny, rushing in something, but we got to go.  Real quick.  Oh, all right.  Hold on a minute.  Let's see what this is.  Hold on.  Because, you know, who knows when we're going to actually invite Vinny back on the  show.  Say, I'm Paul R. Nelson.  I'm Paul.

[02:14:30]  Thank you. 
[02:15:00]  Thank you. 
[02:15:30]  Thank you. 
[02:16:00]  Thank you. 
[02:16:30]  Thank you. 
[02:17:00]  Thank you. 
[02:17:30]  Yes, as I try to get my headphones right.  And I am saying legendary.  Yes.  You are a legend.  Look at him.  He's all embarrassed.  George A. Romero.  Thank you.  Sir.  Hello.  Huge fans.  Huge fans right here.  Legend is old, I think.  You know, that's the front.  No, no.  You know something, though?  You've been a legend for a while.  So, we're all huge fans. 
[02:18:00]  I mean, the films are just fascinated.  I know me.  I know me.  I know me.  For years.  They're amongst some of the most frightening movies.  And it's not even that slasher, frightening, or the trendy, whatever, the super du jour kind of scary is.  This, this, your movies are that, it's that consistent, just frightening zombie movie that people are actually, you know, they get scared of. 
[02:18:30]  They can't sleep afterwards.  Yeah.  And, uh, just, the whole series has just been fantastic.  And now you have something new coming out, Diary of the Dead.  Yeah, Diary of the Dead.  Yep.  It's coming out February 15th.  And what's the gist?  Small, limited release.  It's a much smaller picture.  It's about, uh, my zombie films have always been about sort of what's happening out in the world, you know?  It's not so much the story.  It's the zombies, uh, you know, they could be a hurricane or any other disaster.  And the stories are more about how people respond or fail to respond to the, to the dilemma. 
[02:19:00]  Yeah.  And this is about, it's really about this, uh, emerging, you know, alternate media, how the whole world is being, everybody's being turned into a reporter.  Uh, it strikes me as a little scary.  So that's what this is about.  And it goes back to the very first night.  It goes back to the night of Night of the Living Dead.  And it's sort of a parallel story.  A bunch of film students out, uh, shooting a school project when, uh, the zombies begin to walk.  So they document, it's all subjective camera, uh, and they document what happens to them over the first three days. 
[02:19:30]  And, uh, that's it, you know, in a nutshell.  Like Cloverfield just came out.  They had that same thing.  Same kind of conceit.  Yeah.  Language.  Yeah.  Which probably didn't make you happy that, uh, like, wait a minute, I've been working on this.  Yeah.  Well, I was working before I knew anything about Cloverfield.  Doing this with zombies, you bestest.  Yeah.  But that's a big, you know, that's a big budget, uh, you know, what, New York gets destroyed or something.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[02:20:00]  Uh, this is very different.  It's a very personal film.  It was really, for me, going back to the roots.  And, uh, you know, we shot on a very low budget.  And I had, for the first time since Night of the Living Dead, had complete control of it.  So, I'm the guy to blame.  And, uh, you know, it's, uh, it's really sort of one from the heart.  What's your favorite work that you've done?  I mean, you obviously have a very, uh, complete body of work.  What's your favorite thing that you shot?  Is it Night of the Living Dead?  Is it Dawn of the Dead?  No, no, it's not.  It's neither.  My favorite two films are, are a film I made called Martin and a film I made called Night Riders. 
[02:20:30]  I think nine people saw them in the, uh, you know, luckily my, thank God for a video, you know, stuff goes out.  Yeah.  So, I have 65-year-old fans and 16-year-old fans, thanks to videos.  Yeah, absolutely.  What, uh, the fascination with zombies.  I mean, it's, uh, there aren't many, unless they're really, I mean, garbage.  But, uh, there aren't many zombie movies that aren't, aren't a hit with people.  And, uh, your movies especially. 
[02:21:00]  Yeah, it's hard to name the really big ones.  I mean, Shaun of the Dead was great.  It's kind of a spoof.  Yeah, definitely.  The original remake of, of, uh, my film, the remake of Dawn of the Dead.  Made a lot of dough.  Some of the other, I don't think of the 28 Days or 28 Weeks films as zombie films.  No.  Because they're not dead.  They're, they're infected.  Infected.  And they run.  And they run.  They run, which, uh, does not pay attention to the George A. Romero rule of zombies.  Yeah, you don't run.  Which is the lumbering, slow zombie.  That somehow sneaks up on you. 
[02:21:30]  Well, you know, I, maybe it's the influence of when I was growing up, you know, the old  Christopher Lee mummy things.  Uh-huh.  You can blow him full of holes and he just keeps coming.  Yeah.  Moves slow, but he just keeps coming.  And, uh, that's the thing that I find that scarier than something running after me, you  know.  Because there's that anticipation, you know, right?  Instead of someone, something running right at you and attacking you.  And it's the, the, the surprise of, you know, opening that door.  Or if you're fumbling to try to find some keys in, in the car and, and you get up and 
[02:22:00]  turn and, hello, he's right there.  He's right there.  That's a little scarier than somebody just running after you.  I know, I know.  It's great.  Well, it's like the original version of the thing, the Christian Ivey version.  You know, it's all about doors.  When you open a door.  And a couple of times, there he is.  And it just, uh, you know, to me, that's the, it, it is anticipation.  It's buildup rather than the actual.  That slow hopelessness.  That's just going to get you eventually.  Yeah.  Well, that was hanging there.  It's going to outlast you.  That was the scariest part of Halloween for me was the Michael Myers.  He didn't run. 
[02:22:30]  He's just walked.  And yet he always got there before you did.  It was creepy.  This guy knows a lot of shortcuts.  But he didn't run.  And that was the beauty of him.  The victim is just not smart.  I mean, come on.  You should be able to outrun a zombie.  Let's be honest here.  Oh, yeah.  In my films, that's people, that's the mistake that everybody makes.  They keep trying to go on with life as if it's normal, you know.  Yeah.  Just get out of town.  It's not.  No.  Something dead is alive out there.  The, the original, uh, Night of the Living Dead, uh, especially for the time, was very shocking. 
[02:23:00]  Uh, the, the eating of the entrails and, and stuff like that.  Did you, did you come across any resistance with the, uh, uh, the, uh, ratings?  I don't, there probably wasn't even a ratings board.  No, that's, I'm, listen, that, that film is old enough that there was no MPAA.  Yeah, yeah.  In fact, it was one of the films that people used to point at when, and, and say that we,  we really need somebody to control these guys.  Uh, so.  Thanks.  Thanks for that contribution.  So, you, you ruined it. 
[02:23:30]  Because of you, I couldn't see Kentucky Fried Movie.  Well, it was that, and there were a couple of, uh, concert films.  Um, not, I guess the prior concerts were after the MPAA, but, uh, you know, there were a few  films that were out.  But then, the second, Dawn of the Dead and Day of the Dead, uh, we were lucky enough to  get distributors that put them out without ratings.  You know, they bucked the MPAA and put them out without a rating.  And it was a time when you could do that, because, like, the prior concerts were going  out unrated.  And, you know, it still had a little bit of respect.  It wasn't, uh, you know. 
[02:24:00]  It's funny, man.  You can get away with violence as much as you want, you know, but you start, you know,  you, you go sex and forget about it.  You get slammed, you know.  Then they want the, uh, X rating on it.  Yeah.  Well, whereas, you know, in, in, in the UK, get away with as much sex as you want, but  violence gets.  Then they don't like the violence over there.  Have you thought about a zombie porn?  I haven't, no.  But maybe if I could think of a good theme for that, you know, some sort of.  There, there, there have been some, uh, scenes in, uh, some of the movies with, you 
[02:24:30]  know, you see some half-naked zombie girl.  And for some reason, it's surprisingly hot.  I don't know why.  I don't know why a zombie breast is so hot.  I'll tell you why.  No, it takes the charm away when you see the toe tags.  Yeah.  So.  No, you're actually, it's actually, it actually adds charm.  Because it's everything you want a girl to be.  It's like, uh, you know, she's just, she's naked and she doesn't say a word.  It just moans a lot.  Too much, man.  Hey, is there any movie that scares the hell out of you?  Like, or was it one that you saw? 
[02:25:00]  Not for a long time.  As a kid, yeah.  The thing, I was talking about that.  That scared me pretty much when I was a kid.  How about the original Exorcist?  The original Exorcist, you know, I was raised Catholic, so it added maybe a little bit more  of an effect on me.  I've heard that people that had a Catholic upbringing, you know, were more shook up by  that movie than others.  But, uh, yeah, but I was old enough then and already had made, uh, my first couple of  films.  So, you know.  Knew the magic behind it.  Yeah, you know that it's just, you're just looking to see how did they do that?  And, you know, what was it like coming up with the, uh, some of the effects, uh, especially 
[02:25:30]  on the first one?  Because that was pretty, pretty groundbreaking.  Yeah, well, I mean, one of the investors, there were 26 investors, you know, everybody, the  biggest guy was in for 5G's.  Oh, wow.  So, yeah.  Wow.  Uh, one of them was a meatpacker.  So, all those, uh, intestines and livers and everything actually came from a meatpacking  plant.  They were real.  Uh, fresh.  He kept them refrigerated.  Wow. 
[02:26:00]  It's an amazing stat here.  I'm sorry to interrupt you.  Dawn of the Dead, which would go on to bring in over $55 million, was made for $500,000.  Yeah.  So, it's like when you hear the investor was in for $5,000.  That's a good investment.  Yeah.  Yeah.  No, I know.  Yeah, everybody, um, you know, picked up a few shekels on that one.  But that was the biggest one that, that would be, it went out because it was, it was very  successful.  It opened in Europe first.  It was actually partially financed by an Italian director, Dario Argento.  I don't know if any of you guys know his stuff.  Suspiria.  Oh, Suspiria.  Yeah. 
[02:26:30]  Yeah, that was creepy.  I remember the commercial for that.  Suspiria with the girl brushing her hair.  Yeah.  And she'd turn around and have a skeleton face.  Yeah.  Scared the crap out of me as a kid.  How do you remember that?  Uh, I sat in front of the, I sat in front of the TV a lot when I was a kid.  You're supposed to remember that.  Very good looking.  What Anthony remembers.  Just, that was so nice.  Hey, we got Danny in the studio.  Danny has been freaked out ever since he, he knew you were coming in.  Uh-oh.  Well, I'm a big.  That's right.  You always wear the shirt.  I'm a huge, yeah, I'm a huge Romero fan.  Oh, you're kidding me.  Oh, John. 
[02:27:00]  He's, he's the biggest, uh, absolutely.  What about you?  You got a few questions?  Yeah, I did, uh, I did prepare.  And I do have some.  I'm prepared.  If you understood how amazing this is, what a sign of respect this is for anybody on this  staff to prepare for anything.  Oh, man.  To prepare, yeah, right?  Yeah.  I did, I did, uh, write some typical fanboy questions.  Oh, boy.  Oh, all right.  Well, let's go with it.  You're just trying to get on message boards.  I'm sure you've answered a million times, but, uh, I will try anyway.  Uh, you did mention the, uh, the Italian release of Dawn of the Dead.  Yeah.  And I do know that, uh, I believe the pronunciation of his name is Lucio Fulci, if I'm not mistaken. 
[02:27:30]  Yes.  He came out with Zombie 2, which was kind of like...  But the pronunciation of pronunciation is pronunciation, you're told.  That's the Italian pronunciation of pronunciation.  Pronunciation.  Now, rephrase that and ask Mr. Remereau.  Oh, Danny wanted to sound smart there.  No.  Come on.  I knew it.  I knew it was because of the beauty of that. 
[02:28:00]  All right.  But, uh, I was curious if you really felt that, uh, Zombie 2 was a ripoff of your, of your  work.  Well, I think it was not only, uh, well, let's say inspired by it, but, uh, they, they ripped  off the title because, uh, Dawn of the Dead, the title in Italy was Zombie.  It was Zombie, right.  So, uh, this guy comes out and says, I'm going to make Zombie 2 with nobody's permission,  you know, or anything else.  But I like some of Fulci's films.  I mean, he probably has made more of the sort of zombie knockoffs than anybody else in the  world.  And some of them were really pretty funny and, uh, okay. 
[02:28:30]  I mean, old and, you know, they wouldn't stand up today, I don't think, but they're not political  at all.  They're just...  No, they're just kind of good, creepy movies.  Yeah.  Um, speaking of messages in your films, I know, uh, you know, a lot of people say that Dawn  of the Dead dealt with consumerism and Night of the Living Dead dealt a lot with the racial  tension at the time.  Uh, but Day of the Dead, the third installment, uh, a lot of people say that that focused really  around the AIDS virus and the fear of AIDS at the time.  And now, I don't know if that's true.  No, it's not, it wasn't even what was in my mind.  To me, it was all about mistrust.  I mean, it seems like that was right around the time when we were starting to lose faith 
[02:29:00]  in everything.  You know, the military, the government, institutions, church, uh, and individuals.  I mean, losing faith in each other.  So, to me, that's what, that's what I was working with with that film.  It's just this breakdown of society because nobody trusts anybody.  You know, even in that little community, living in a cave.  That's what's so, guys, sorry, Danny.  Uh, that's what's so intriguing about the movies, too, is that slow kind of breakdown of  society. 
[02:29:30]  And I don't know why that's so fascinating to people, but it really is in movies when  there's this just complete breakdown of society and only a few actually can, can make it through  that.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Well, there used to be a genre, you know, before I started, you know, like the world,  the flesh and the devil, there's nobody left in New York except Harry Belafonte.  I guess I haven't seen the Will Smith thing, but maybe it's a little bit like that.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[02:30:00]  It's interesting because I basically ripped off the idea for Night of the Living Dead from  the book I Am Legend.  Really?  Yeah.  Before the other versions of that film were made.  Yeah, that was kind of an Omega Man remake.  Matheson in the book, and I guess in this film, starts with only one guy left in the  world.  Mm-hmm.  And everyone has become a vampire.  Oof.  And, you know, so I felt, well, you know, it's the 60s, and I said, well, this is like  about revolution, but, you know, start the story at the beginning rather than when there's 
[02:30:30]  only one guy left.  Right.  And so that's what I wanted to do.  So I knocked off the idea.  And I told Richard, he said, all right, if you make a lot of money, send me a check.  So, but that was a genre that was a specific genre.  And then I think maybe what we started in the 60s and 70s, those of us that were working  then, there's a documentary called American Nightmare about me, Wes Craven, Landis, some  of the guys that were making like really hard, hard-ass horror right around that time. 
[02:31:00]  And I think we sort of wanted to show the, you know, the roots of it.  Maybe it was, you know, our own sort of, you know, 60s guys sitting around pissed off  because our revolution hadn't worked.  Right.  Peace and love really didn't change it.  All of a sudden there's this war.  There's some funny place over there, Viet, what?  And rioting in the streets again and all that.  But the racial thing in that, I mean, you know, we have, there's a, we used an African-American 
[02:31:30]  actor in the lead in Night of the Living Dead.  He was just the best actor from among our friends.  We finished the film and we were literally driving an answer print to New York in the  car.  And that night in the car on the radio, we heard that Martin Luther King had been shot.  And then, which just completely changed the face of the movie.  And, and, you know, it was something that we had done before that had happened.  And, uh, you know, I don't know.  I guess if there's any credit can be given to us is that we didn't change the script.  Yeah.  When he, uh, when Dwayne agreed to play the part, but that was an accidental thing. 
[02:32:00]  But then all of a sudden I felt this responsibility.  I said, oh man, I got, I got a new job here.  I have to do these with a little bit of social, uh, satire.  Kind of forced into the situation.  Anyway, sorry.  Oh, Danny could just stand there.  Cause I actually wanted to bring up, uh, Vincent Price and, uh, The Last Man on Earth.  That's, I am legend.  That's the same.  That's, that's the same, uh, story.  Based on the same story.  And that was another one that just scared the shit out of me when, when, let me in. 
[02:32:30]  Yeah.  And, uh, he's just, you know, there's nothing.  It's that doom when even in a movie you realize, my God, there is no way they're getting out  of this.  This isn't going to be a happy ending.  This, you know, they're not going to wrap this up by finding some way to, to save the  world.  It's over, Johnny.  You know?  Yeah.  So that, that was also something that we wanted to do.  Seems to me the reason to do horror is to upset the apple cart.  Mm-hmm.  And in the old days, they used to just very deliberately re, reestablish order. 
[02:33:00]  Right.  Yeah.  Kill a giant spider and it's over.  Right.  And forget the bomb that caused it, you know?  Yeah.  Them was another one with the ants.  Yeah.  Uh, but, uh, yeah, it's just that doom of, oh my God, this movie's going to end and they're,  they're just gone.  Everybody's dead.  Uh, it's fascinating stuff.  I love it.  Love that.  Danny, another question.  Sure.  Um, well, I'm curious if, uh, if you feel any kind of responsibility for, uh, a lot of the  gaming industry today, a lot of video games have to deal with, you know, a lot of the 
[02:33:30]  more popular video games are, have to deal with zombies like Resident Evil and, uh, there's  one called Stubbs the Zombie and also Anomalism.  Silent Hill.  The Silent Hill series a little bit.  And I think a lot of it really establishes a base on, on a lot of your films.  And I was wondering if you felt the same way.  Well, I think that, that maybe that, uh, my series of films, particularly Dawn of the  Dead caused a lot of that.  But I think the, the, the thing that is most responsible for the, the, the zombie, uh, 
[02:34:00]  becoming sort of a popular, you know, it's entered the lexicon, it's idiomatic, the rules  are becoming idiomatic, you know, pretty soon there'll be a zombie on Sesame Street hanging  out with the count.  And, uh, I, I think it's video games more than movies that have made, that have popular,  really popularized, uh, the new American zombie.  Yeah.  We upset with, uh, it has made transformation, some of the zombies.  And there's this one in particular, Dead Rising.  I mean, it's basically Dawn of the Dead, the video game.  It's like, you're a guy in a mall. 
[02:34:30]  Yeah.  You know, and there's zombies everywhere.  So, yeah.  I mean, that's just a blatant rep.  They seem to have gotten that idea from somebody.  Yeah.  I think so.  That mall atmosphere, though, is classic.  It, it's just so great because that is the definition of, of who we are and what we  do.  And then to have that as your last castle, you know, your last bastion of hope, uh, is really  great in those movies and just surrounded by, by thousands of these, uh, uh, creatures.  Yeah.  And I'm such a...  And it's other humans that, that win it, you know, that, that win the day when the bikers 
[02:35:00]  show up.  But, um, I'm sorry.  Oh, no, no, no, please.  I'm such a dope.  I, I, honestly, I'd never see social messages until like they're explained.  I'm like, oh yeah.  Honest to God.  I would go, wow, that's kind of cool.  A mall.  Yeah.  I go there a lot.  I'm sitting here thinking the same thing.  I'm like, I must be an idiot.  Cause I never, I look at it and like, oh, these zombies are eating people.  That's all I think.  Yeah.  And they needed to do it somewhere.  Why not a mall?  That's true.  I thought it was all product placement.  He's trying to do a little more. 
[02:35:30]  The zombies are at Starbucks.  Zombie is gargling with the forest.  I mean, I mean, you said earlier that the racial thing was accidental, right?  I mean, so you didn't do that with that.  You weren't shooting that to make a statement.  The first film?  No.  I mean, we got lucky when Martin Luther King caught a bullet.  So, yeah, as we were starting to shoot it, though, we became aware of it.  And Dwayne, the actor, was much more sensitive to it than I was.  You know, I mean, he actually pulled me aside and he said, you want me to slug this white  woman?  You know what's going to happen when I walk out of the theater?  You know?  Oh, geez.  He was sensitive to all those issues when we were shooting it. 
[02:36:00]  Did you, um, I'm sorry, God.  Yeah, no, no.  I don't want to interrupt you.  I'm sorry, Garth.  So, you know, but then when it was time to, when I finally decided to do the second film,  it was because I met the people, I knew the people socially that developed that shopping  mall.  And I went out to visit the place.  And just before it was open, the trucks were coming in, bringing all this stuff, man, you  know?  And I said, wow.  Perfect timing, too.  Perfect timing.  And he said, you know, there's civil defense supplies upstairs, bomb shelters, everything. 
[02:36:30]  He said, you could survive in this place.  And I'm, bing, you know, like, oh, yeah.  So I, I, and this was 10 years after the first film.  And, uh, so, uh, that gave me the idea for it.  And the idea of this, you know, temple to consumerism and becoming, uh, a place to survive.  I thought it was sort of a fitting kind of a, of a sequel.  You know, there were just five of them in a farmhouse in the first film.  Yeah.  The first movie scared me.  I never sat through it.  I couldn't sit through it.  It was too frightening. 
[02:37:00]  How do they kill the zombies in the movie?  Do they kill the zombies?  In the first film?  Yeah, in any of them.  No, they, they get killed.  Oh, they get killed by humans.  Yeah.  They managed to.  God, you're a cruel man.  Beat him or burn him.  I'm going to watch the movie.  Beat him or burn him.  Beat him or burn him.  Right.  They're all messed up.  He's actually asking George how a film from 1968 ends.  Yeah, but you know, I'll tell you something.  But look, I meant it as a compliment.  I couldn't sit through that movie.  I was too frightened.  That's another compliment.  I can't sit through your movies.  You stink, Vinny.  That's a wonderful compliment. 
[02:37:30]  How does it end?  You're a social zombie.  At least he's not here.  I've had my viewers say that.  I couldn't sit through it, but let me tell you what I thought about it.  Danny, anything else?  Well, sure.  Well, since we're on the topic of night anyway, I was wondering what you thought of Tom Savini's  color remake.  I mean, the ending was a little, was a little twisted.  You weren't expecting that.  But I was wondering if you felt that it was, it lived up to your standards.  What was the difference in the ending, Danny?  I don't remember.  In the remake, Cooper is the one that gets killed at the end just because he was a giant asshole.  Well, he does, Tony Saad gets killed as well. 
[02:38:00]  It's just that Barbara survives.  I was apologizing to women when I wrote that script.  Barbara.  Because in the first film, she just loses her shoes, falls down, typical, you know, like  50s.  Oh, he's an amazing girl.  They're coming for you, Barbara.  So that was really, it was an apology to women.  But I liked it. 
[02:38:30]  I thought Tom did a great job.  We were basically trying to reestablish a copyright.  You know, we lost a copyright on the first film.  Tom's pretty at the forefront of special effects and that type of makeup.  Yeah, well, he was.  He was really the, he was the go-to guy for a long time.  Yeah, absolutely.  But he now is more interested in acting.  Yeah.  Well, that's what I wanted to ask you, too, because he was in a movie that I just, I think  is great and obviously your opinion matters in certain movies. 
[02:39:00]  Dust Till Dawn.  Yeah, Dust Till Dawn.  That one, he was in that.  Yeah, Sex Machine.  Yeah, Sex Machine.  I thought that was a pretty, pretty cool movie.  Yeah, I liked it a lot.  He's in Grindhouse, too.  Yeah, Grindhouse.  Did you like Grindhouse?  I like Grindhouse, yeah.  Planetary?  Huh?  Not Planetary, you enjoyed what they did with the planets, too?  I did, I liked the other one better, you know, I mean, I love, I mean, I know those guys  and, you know, I just had a good time watching it.  Right.  I don't know that audiences today get that, you know, that there could be a real missing 
[02:39:30]  and it's all scratched up and burns on it.  I mean, that doesn't happen anymore, right?  Better not, yeah.  Yeah, I mean, the whole thing fell flat, but I really enjoyed it.  I would say that, you know, now that we're not promoting the film anymore, I enjoyed the  experience of Grindhouse.  Yeah, me too.  All the way.  Do you, as a director and as an artist, do you like, because this one film is basically,  or a couple of films is like people associate you with that, like, does it bother you that  other stuff you did isn't as well associated? 
[02:40:00]  Or are you happy just to have something that, that, that massive that you're kind of pegged  with it?  You know, of course it, it always bothers you when people don't get what you're doing.  You know, I made a film called Bruiser and nobody got it.  And I mean, you know, it's just, uh, somehow just went, you know, it's in a different layer  of the atmosphere or something.  What was Bruiser about?  It's called Bruiser.  What was it about?  It's about loss of identity.  It's about a guy that just gets so, uh, you know, screwed by people, everybody around  him, his wife, his boss, his friends, and he just believes that he'd completely, he 
[02:40:30]  believes he loses his face.  It's, you know, it's a loss of identity and he turns violent because of it.  Film was a bit of a reaction to Columbine and, you know, and, um, I liked the film a  lot, but nobody got it.  I think they thought it was too, maybe too silly.  This guy running around without a face, you know, I thought it would be scary, but people  didn't seem to.  Is there anything worse?  That's a risk.  I like how you go like, well, what are you going to do?  I still like it. 
[02:41:00]  I couldn't sit through it.  Vinny, let me tell you how it ends.  That's got to be very frustrating, too.  Like, it's like when you do a comedy and no one laughs, you know, that's got to be like  when you do a horror film.  Vinny?  You go, eh.  I was thinking Jimmy, but I was like, I'm not going to do that.  No, I'm going to get you.  When you do a horror film and people go, ah, it didn't scare me, like, that's got to  be like, fuck.  Yeah, right.  That's your purpose.  It is.  I mean, it's, you know, although I don't know.  I haven't been, my stuff is more comic book-y. 
[02:41:30]  It's got, it's got this creepy thing of, you know, all these dead, the neighbors, dead  neighbors walking around.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And, you know, neighbors are scary enough.  When they're dead, it's a little less.  That was the whole gist of the one with Ving Rhames and the beginning of that one where  it's just the neighbors and the girl.  Yeah, I love that part where she wakes up, you know, her boyfriend or husband, is it, just 
[02:42:00]  gets killed by the kid next door and she walks out not knowing what's going on and it's  already, you know, she's been sleeping.  That's what got me is she was sleeping at some point when utter pandemonium is going on  right outside her door.  Yeah.  And she opens her door to this and, again, it's just over.  There's nothing she could do about it but try to run.  But that's a great part of that movie.  I thought that was the best part of the film.  The overhead shots of the car and the carnage going on around it was fantastic.  And, of course, Creepshow. 
[02:42:30]  Speaking of comic bookie.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  It was the most fun to shoot.  That.  The tagline was the most fun you'll ever have being scared but it was the most fun to shoot.  I watch that still every few months just to get a great laugh.  I mean, some of the scenes in that are hysterical.  Well, one of my favorites is Ted Danson buried up to his neck in the sand with the crab.  And Leslie Nielsen just goes, found a friend, Harry. 
[02:43:00]  As a matter of factly.  Great.  So many funny scenes in that.  Where's my cake, Bedelia, you bitch?  Boy, I can't believe you know all these lines, man.  Oh, I've watched it so many times.  Bugs, Mr. Pratt?  Oh, yeah.  Bugs got your tongue?  I mean, just funny lines that you just keep laughing.  It doesn't matter.  I've seen it a thousand times and I'll still laugh.  And, of course, probably the top one out of that is the one with Adrienne Barbeau.  Right. 
[02:43:30]  And I'm sorry.  Tell it to call you Billy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Just tell it to call you Billy.  And that surprise shot where he just, she's bitching at him.  He pulls a huge gun out and just shoots her in the head and everyone goes, great shot.  And you're looking like, what the hell just happened?  And realize he's just fantasizing about the whole thing.  Fantastic, man.  I love that movie.  That was really fun to do.  It was great fun to do.  Hey, let's go to the phones.  A lot of people want to get in on the interview with George Romero.  It's Kent, the movie guy.  Kent. 
[02:44:00]  Hey, Kent.  Hold on, Mr. Romero.  I'm sorry.  Hold on now.  We got to get some headphones on.  Okay.  I got it.  Sorry about that.  I should have won.  You're on the air.  Kent, go ahead.  Not hearing it.  Sorry.  I went and saw Land of the Dead in Japan with my dad.  Totally coincidentally.  And my dad's never seen a horror movie in his entire life.  And he got so scared.  He didn't know how to deal with it at the end.  So he just slugged me.  We're walking out of this movie theater.  And the biggest compliment you can get in Japan, I hear, is just complete silence. 
[02:44:30]  Like, that's how they respect the movie over there.  Wow.  And they were all walking out.  They're all talking about it and everything.  Oh, so they weren't being silent.  All the girls are scared.  And then all of a sudden, my dad, this 6'4", white guy, slugs me.  And we're just getting stared at by maybe 50 to 70 Japanese people.  Wow.  Can I tell you what a great point George just made?  The guy goes, the biggest comment you can give in a movie is to not talk about it.  And then he goes, and so everybody in Japan is walking and chit-chatting about it. 
[02:45:00]  Talking.  It's like, gee, thanks.  I mean, you know, like here, if a movie's really good, they'll give applause.  Right, yeah.  There, it's just like everyone gets up.  Oh, I see.  Right.  Hey, George, are you there?  I mean, how bad was it?  Yeah.  How bad did he hit?  How tough was it, man?  I didn't want to miss the moment.  Are you casting for New Zombies?  Not right now.  Oh, so we got the perfect guy.  He just walked in with our food.  You got to meet.  Clubster to Kenny.  Could be the star of the.  He's got no personality. 
[02:45:30]  He's got hair like a zombie.  It's all dry.  Hey, he just smiled.  He just smiled.  That doesn't.  No, but this is our.  No smiling.  Watch this.  I apologize.  Sorry to me until.  And he's dumb as a zombie.  Yes.  That's correct.  We can have him brighten up a little bit and chip her up to play the zombies.  You need him to.  A little more lively, maybe.  Where do the majority of the zombies come from in the movies, the cast?  Are they just.  Extras. 
[02:46:00]  Extras and friends.  You ever get friends to.  They go, hey, I want to be a zombie.  Yes.  And we've been able to do that.  The last two films we shot in Canada and the unions are really rigid up there.  Zombie union.  When I was.  Yeah, zombie union.  The dead have rights.  Yeah.  But.  So you can only use friends on days when you have hired a certain amount of union extras.  Uh huh.  So, you know, it's a little.  It's a little tougher to do that.  When I was working in Pittsburgh, I made all my films except for the until the last three in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. 
[02:46:30]  And they were outside the, you know, the circle of.  I think there's a 300 mile limit.  On the New York extras union.  Oh, really?  So, you know, we were able to do whatever we wanted to do.  But, um, over, uh, up in Canada, it's pretty, it's pretty rigid.  And you've had to.  But they come from, I mean, you know, and I'm telling you, man, sometimes professionals are worse.  I mean, I'd much rather have buddies or, you know, the neighbors, literally the neighbors. 
[02:47:00]  I would guess people that are familiar with your work probably know how to imitate what you want better than somebody you're trying to actually direct.  Uh, you know, I think we've all kind of done.  That whole thing.  There was a funny scene in, uh, in Shaun of the Dead.  And that's spoofy kind of scene where, um, where they had to mix in with the zombies.  So they all try to act like zombies.  Yeah, exactly.  And, uh, yeah, that's kind of, kind of funny when you think of getting an actor in there and having to tell him, all right, do this. 
[02:47:30]  Or, no, you're not getting it right.  You're not zombie enough.  I can't make a physical move.  I mean, if I'm talking to a bunch of extras, if I even just do this, you know, then all of a sudden you get everybody doing that.  It looks like Thriller.  But, uh, so people, I find that it's best to leave people up to, you know, let them do what they, their interpretation.  And sometimes you get great stuff.  I mean, sometimes you get these really exaggerated, you know, things you have to cut around or cut out.  Yeah. 
[02:48:00]  But, uh, you very often get some really creative stuff.  Some of the creepiest ones are that emotionless dropped face where it's just, you know, it's just some mindless thing coming after you.  Yeah.  And those are the creepiest, uh, ones drooling maybe.  I want a zombie that snaps his fingers.  That's what you need.  One zombie that just snaps a little.  Fingers would break.  Yeah.  They just snap off.  Snap.  Let's say hi to Colin in Florida.  Colin.  Hi, Mr. Romero.  Hi, Colin. 
[02:48:30]  Uh, it's an honor to speak to you.  Thank you.  I was, the staff already brought up the resonating movie.  Yeah.  And you actually wrote a script for it.  Yeah.  Could you talk about that?  Well, I got fired.  It's the first time I ever got fired.  Jeez.  It was, uh, they, we were working with the, it was a German company.  We were working with the executives in LA and with Capcom with the game company.  And we thought we had, you know, really written a pretty good script.  But, uh, the management of the, of the production company just didn't want to go that way. 
[02:49:00]  So, uh, you know, I mean, I didn't really get fired.  I got paid for the, for the work and everything.  But they, they decided that they wanted to just go a different direction, which had nothing  to do with the game.  It's got to be hard to, your script is online and is far superior to the dreck that they  put on there and just a epitome of, uh, Hollywood not knowing what people want.  Yeah.  Well, in this case, it wasn't Hollywood.  The, the Hollywood office of Constantine really liked it.  It was, uh, the German headquarters that, that, uh, that didn't like it. 
[02:49:30]  So thank you, sir.  That's amazing.  Thank you.  It's, uh, it's weird.  It's gotta be hard writing a script like that too, because so much of the horror or,  or the vibe of it is in the way it's shot and is in the, like you said, the face, the  drop draw, these different things.  It's kind of hard to put in a script.  So people will just look at the script and go, well, what is this going to do?  Yeah.  It doesn't scare me.  Right.  No music.  I'm going to send some musicians over with the script.  Read this one.  Man opens the door, lady's standing there, fix this.  It's not scary. 
[02:50:00]  And then when you look at it, of course.  I think.  All right.  Let's go to, uh, Jody in New York.  Jody.  Hi.  Hi.  Um, I was wondering why, um, uh, zombies can't walk upstairs.  They can.  Sure they can.  I don't think they walk upstairs.  Well, they have in my films.  Yeah.  The end of dawn, they climb a ladder.  I mean, they get up to the roof, actually, uh, in, in dawn.  Thank God you called.  Yeah.  Because she would have run upstairs if there were zombies and, and they'd have gotten her.  She'd have been surprised.  A better question is, why don't they take elevators? 
[02:50:30]  Well, they have a hard time with escalators.  Because they also do take an elevator in dawn of the day.  They take elevators.  And they also just miss getting into elevators, which is very good.  One zombie pushes the button, and the other zombie's like, I already pushed that.  Why does it have to re-push it?  Even as zombies, they're annoyed.  Let's see how people do that in Georgia.  Sean.  Hey, Mr. McMahon.  Hi.  Have you, have you, have you read any of the zombie literature, like World War Z and anything  like that?  And what do you think about those? 
[02:51:00]  Uh, you know, it's, uh, I don't know.  What can I say?  I mean, I like Max.  He's a great guy.  Max Brooks.  And, uh, I like the survival guy, and I like World, I like World War Z.  Uh, but, you know, I don't know.  It's, uh, it's not my stuff, you know.  It's, my stuff is, I have this peculiar niche, and my stuff is all really about what's happening  in the world.  And, you know, it's not, it's not sort of zombies for the sake of zombies.  And so, uh, Max takes it very seriously as if it were a real plague, and that's the way 
[02:51:30]  he approaches it.  And, you know, great.  That's, you know.  Can I paraphrase?  George thinks it's shit.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's just being a little too nice for the show.  He's a nice guy.  No, I didn't.  He thinks it's crap all.  George, do you watch the newer horror films, and what do you think of them?  Like Hostel, or Saw, or?  I've seen enough of them to sort of stay away from the sequel.  It's just not, again, man, it's not my thing.  I'm, I'm much more of a traditionalist. 
[02:52:00]  I mean, I'm much more of a, I'd rather do Creepshow.  I'd rather do something a little more operatic or gothic.  And, uh, you know, it's just what it, what, it's all about what you grew up on.  Sure.  Did that guy really have roaches on his face?  Yeah.  Ugh!  Yeah, he did.  We had to, we, I mean, the only way to get him to stay there, we had, they had to give  him CO2 or something, you know, to slow him down.  Because otherwise, we, we, we would, they would dump out a big Rubbermaid trash can full  of roaches on that set.  And within 20 seconds, you couldn't see one. 
[02:52:30]  But, I mean, you know.  Wow, they just disappear.  But, take the phone apart and there's this phone-shaped thing, which is like the old roach.  And, uh, it was, it was dreadful.  It's the worst time that me and my crew ever had on a set.  It was just hideous.  Because they were everywhere.  They were, you'd, they'd get in your briefcase.  They'd get, you know, you were pulling them out with your script.  That's awful.  It was dreadful.  Where'd they get them from?  They had to go to Trinidad.  Chinese restaurant. 
[02:53:00]  Trinidad.  Left an egg roll on the table at the stretch factory.  Oh, oh, oh, Benny gets it.  Oh, that was unnecessary.  Oh.  I say.  Why do you go to Trinidad for cockroaches?  They, if you, if you buy cockroaches from a lab, we needed like, you know, 500,000 roaches.  So, they charge 50 cents a piece.  That's a little pushy into the budget.  Yeah.  Cheaper to send guys to, uh, to Trinidad.  And they literally brought back barrels of these things.  And they had their own trailer.  It had to be climatized. 
[02:53:30]  So, wait.  They, they would just ship a barrel of live roaches.  Yeah.  What do they put food-wise in there for them?  How do they eat?  You know, I don't know that.  I, I don't know.  These guys, they were.  I have a piece of cheese.  Anything.  Anything.  Anything.  I have to shit.  Well, there's the barrel.  They eat each other, you know.  And I, I don't know, I don't know what they did that way.  I don't know.  There's a Creepshow entry on the IMDb listed for release this year.  Now, I mean, I was wondering if that was a, is that a remake or a sequel?  And do you have anything to do with that at all?  No, it's a remake.  And I had nothing to do with it.  Neither did Steve.  Oh, Stephen King.  Stephen King. 
[02:54:00]  Do you have any plans with Stephen King for any upcoming, uh?  You know, we're always talking about a project.  I mean, we've been on and, on and, on again, off again on several things.  Tom Gordon, Buick 8.  And, uh, you know, somehow the stuff just never, you know, either, never happens.  You know, it's pretty hard to, uh, to figure why.  Uh, but no, we're not working on anything right now.  But Steve's, you know, we're still in touch.  Steve does a newscaster voice in the new, in my new film.  Oh, really?  Uh, yeah, a bunch of guys came out to do that.  Quentin Tarantino and Wes Craven. 
[02:54:30]  Oh, yeah, anybody involved in horror has to idolize it.  Quentin's got to be a huge fan, I'm sure, yeah.  It was fun.  It was fun to, you know, it was, um, it was great that they came out to do it.  You know, it was terrific.  You know what else I like about, uh, your work is that, uh, putting humor in, in these horrible  situations.  Uh, there, there's a, a great gruesome scene where they're all on top of the mall shooting  into the crowd and they're holding up the names of celebrities that, uh, that the zombies  look like, which was just, I was in the movie theater with my girlfriend and we were laughing 
[02:55:00]  hysterical and no one else was laughing.  Yeah.  I was really laughing hard.  Jay Leno is one of them.  I guess Jay Leno.  And you're looking, it's a zombie that looks like Jay Leno and the guy just blows his head  off and it's, it's a gruesome scene, but hysterically funny.  Yeah.  And, uh, I've noticed that's been a trend in your work.  Yeah.  Well, that was actually in, in, in Zach's film.  That was in the remake.  But, uh, uh, I, I can't resist it. 
[02:55:30]  I mean, I had a pie fight in Dawn of the Dead, man.  I just couldn't resist it.  I, you know, I, I, I just, uh, I just.  You know, you've, you're out, he, you find yourself out in the middle of nowhere shooting  one of these things and, you know, half of your friends are going to have goop all over  their face and you can't help but chuckle, you know?  And so, uh, I, I can't resist jokes.  There's a few of them in, in the new film too.  There's one that I thought was just going to be way, way too, uh, too slapstick, but I 
[02:56:00]  won't tell people what it is, but it's turned out to be one of the favorite scenes in it.  So I guess there's, there's place, there's room for humor.  The movie comes out, by the way, it's called Diary of the Dead and it's in theaters, uh,  Friday, February 15th, which is that this Friday or the next Friday after the next Friday?  Uh, a week from Friday.  A week from Friday.  A week from Friday it comes out.  Uh, and Lee, I wanted to, you wanted to go to.  Just because you mentioned that, Jimmy, uh, Brett from Long Island, he's actually seen  Diary of the Dead at Tribeca.  Don't give any of the movie away, uh, Brett, but what do you have to say? 
[02:56:30]  I saw it, uh, two weeks ago and, uh, I thought that it was one of the most refreshing pieces  of work that, uh, George has done in a long time.  Wow, man.  Thank you.  Thanks.  You really loved it, huh?  Well, you know, it was, it was great at being free to be able to do exactly what we wanted  to do and, uh, so I don't know, maybe that's why.  It's just purely one from the heart.  It's, uh, a lot of fun and, uh, you know, it was a lot of fun for me to do and, and it's,  it's very gratifying that people are digging it because it's, it's not a big movie in any 
[02:57:00]  way.  It's, it's a very intimate, it's more like Night of the Living Dead that way.  It's a small cast of characters and, in, in, you know, limited situations, it's not Thunderdome,  you know, like Land of the Dead was getting a little too Thunderdome for me.  But, uh, this film seems to be working, so.  What do you think of the CGI and stuff like that?  Is that, is that something obviously over the years that, uh, computer animation, stuff  like that in a film, is that really, uh, jumped into your movies or are you still a little  bit more traditional?  Uh, I, I would prefer to be able to do everything mechanically and on the set. 
[02:57:30]  I'm a purist that way.  I mean, I like the old King Kong, even though the thing looks like a, uh, but, um, there are  just some things you just can't do.  So, you know, like we had to melt a guy's head down with acid and then most actors don't  let you do that.  Although they should.  We could get Rich Voss to do that.  Exactly.  He just drink the acid and be fine.  All right.  As long as I'm a star.  But in this film too, we, we had to work very, very quickly. 
[02:58:00]  I mean, we shared, we only had 20 days to shoot this film.  Wow.  So, uh, and, uh, and it's all subjective camera.  And sometimes, you know, if you do it with a squib, you do a real explosive on the head.  If you don't get the shot, the wall is stained.  You got to repaint the wall, re-rig the script and the squib.  And it just, it sucks off time.  So it's much easier to have the actor point the gun, zombie falls, and you paint in the  gun flash and you paint in the blood.  It's just, being able to do that is just, just makes the production time, the on the 
[02:58:30]  set time, uh, uh, much more efficient.  Less distracting too, I think.  When you're watching a movie and you're just believing it because it looks so real, there's  no part of you that's suspending, like, you know, that I kind of see the way they did  that.  You know, you want to just feel like you're watching it really happening.  And I think it's less distracting when it works like that.  Sure.  Yeah.  Well, I mean, these are all sort of simple effects.  I mean, it's not like when you see a bunch of dinosaurs running around, you know that they  weren't able to actually shoot that.  So, you know, it tips it off that it's CG. 
[02:59:00]  And I, you know, I, I have a young son, 17 year old son who, you know, went to see iRobot  and he said, eh, just, it's all, it's all computers.  Yeah.  Uh, so I think there is a bit of disappointment when, you know, when it's, when that's all it  is, it's just an exercise.  Right.  Let's take one more phone call.  It's Ray in Cleveland.  Ray.  Hi, Mr. Romero.  I'm a huge fan of yours.  Thank you.  Um, I actually have watched every Dawn of the, every dead movie you've made.  Um, I'm sorry about that.  I'm also from Pittsburgh originally. 
[02:59:30]  Hey, all right.  And I, and I've been to Monroeville.  I've seen the house.  I've been to the cemetery.  Oh my God.  Holy cow.  In fact, all when I'm playing hockey for tournaments and stuff.  So it's kind of cool.  Wow.  If that, on that, on that ice rink, on the ice rink in the mall.  No, no.  They actually removed that last time I heard.  Yeah, they did, but I, I didn't know when you were there.  No, no, no.  I played in Bethel Park, all them places, but I've made the point to go to Monroeville  every time.  But you are my idol and I love you for everything you've done to movies, especially horror films. 
[03:00:00]  You're amazing.  Well, thank you very much.  Any questions or?  No, but I think I'm doing a couple of more of these shows later.  Would you call up please?  I have one question, actually.  Okay.  You said, I saw a documentary where you said the movie score for the original, the original  Night of the Living Dead was one in a chess game?  No, the mix, the audio mix.  We had to pay for the movie score, but you know, we paid for needle downs.  In those days, they called them needle downs. 
[03:00:30]  And, uh, uh, but, uh, we won the mix, the audio mix in a chess game.  One of my, Jesus, really, this is real guerrilla stuff.  I guess.  This guy, the guy that owned the lab set up, he was willing to play a chess game for the  mix and we won it.  Wow.  Russ Streiner, Russ Streiner, one of the producers won it.  Oh, very cool.  Uh, actually, Clutch in Baltimore has something.  Uh, Clutch.  Hey, Mr. Romero.  Hi.  Great talking with you.  Hey, um, I just wanted to let you know, when I saw the movie as a kid, I truly wanted to 
[03:01:00]  get lost in a mall while zombies attacked because I wanted to play.  I know.  It was great.  Well, it was a, it was a fantasy for us being there.  And in those days, man, nobody were, I mean, JCPenney said, sure, shoot.  And they didn't make us cover when they did the remake.  You know, nowadays, you could never get away with that.  When they did the remake of Dawn, they had to use fictitious names on all the stores.  And, uh, yeah.  So, I mean, I think we got, we just sort of squeaked in under the wire before, you know,  lawyers and insurance companies, uh, insisted that, that these places, uh, stop doing stuff 
[03:01:30]  like that.  Uh, so.  It's amazing.  Like, uh, like a plane crash.  Every plane crash is like Fred's airline.  It's never like Continental or, you know, Atlantic Star Airlines.  They don't want, yeah, they don't want anything, uh, connected to them like that.  Stupid lawyers.  Zombies might come into JCPenney's.  Yeah.  I've seen that, I swear.  Danny, one final question before we get George out of here?  Oh, sure.  Sure.  It's a very busy man.  Well, uh, there's been a lot of remakes lately.  Uh, the latest one in the horror genre, I think, has probably been Halloween. 
[03:02:00]  And it was, it was all right.  It did very well.  But now there's plans to do a lot of, uh, other remakes like, uh, Friday the 13th, Nightmare  on Elm Street, Hellraiser, I think is slated for a remake.  And do you think that there's really a need to remake these movies?  Or is it, on the other end of that, is it just reintroducing these films to a whole new  generation of kids?  Well, of course, that's the, that's the way they, uh, that's the rationalization.  That's how they justify doing it.  But, you know, the kids have seen them.  They're on video.  And, uh, you know, so I don't, I don't buy that argument.  I think it's just the safety of a, of a, of a proven title. 
[03:02:30]  And Hollywood's going to go that way rather than take a chance.  You know, they, they read scripts.  They don't know, is this any good or not?  Yeah, just knowing that they could spend a minimal amount of money and get a huge return  on it justifies the quality.  And it has the automatic, uh, recognition of title recognition.  It really is amazing how the, the writing just sucks so badly in a lot of these.  They, they just keep remaking.  King Kong, I think, I was happy they remade simply for graphics and they could do so much  more now.  But movies like Nightmare on Elm Street, they don't need to remake that.  It was horrifying.  No.  Yeah. 
[03:03:00]  The way it was.  Absolutely.  But it's just some, some dumb young shit, some 30-year-old who's in a position he doesn't  belong in, uh, who's not a good enough writer to come up with something creative and he  can't make the decision to go, all right, well, this is good.  Let's take a chance.  Uh, he's just going to steal something.  And, uh, I think you're very diplomatic in saying that.  No, no, no.  Especially the first, the first three Elm Streets are the third one.  I mean, that, that, those were really terrific.  Great ideas.  They don't need to be remade.  Absolutely.  You know, you can't, you, nobody, and the chances of them improving or coming up with better  ideas is pretty slim. 
[03:03:30]  Not Robert Englund, obviously.  Are they going to use a different Freddy?  Are they?  I don't think it's been casted.  I don't know.  Okay.  I also got to ask you one more thing about, uh, the end of the original, uh, Night of  the Living Dead.  Um, case of mistaken identity or, or, uh, intentionally shooting him at the end.  I mean.  Uh, no, they weren't.  You mean, just, again, that, that's talked about as a racial issue.  And when we wrote the script, in my mind, when I wrote that scene, the guy in my mind  was a white guy.  So it wasn't, people have talked about this, they say, well, they see a black guy and they 
[03:04:00]  shoot him.  Yeah.  Uh, that wasn't intended at all.  They see a shadow in the window.  They think it's a zombie and they shoot him.  So in my mind, it was always just mistaken identity.  For a smart guy, it was pretty stupid.  Just kind of poking his head up like that.  You know?  Yeah.  But he's not.  He had a hard night.  He makes a lot of mistakes.  Yeah.  He spends the whole movie arguing, don't go into the basement.  And that's where he goes.  And that's what saves him.  Yeah.  And then, you know, so he, he makes a lot of mistakes.  Well, we should let George, uh, yes, we have a lot of interviews today, huh? 
[03:04:30]  The final plug is a diary of the dead.  It's in theaters, uh, Friday, a week from this Friday, February 15th.  And, uh, it was written, directed and, uh, co-produced, uh, uh, by George Romero, which  is nice that you had so much control over it.  Oh, it was terrific.  Yeah.  And I was so happy.  I'm sorry.  No, no, no.  I was just going to say, thank you guys.  It's really been fun.  Oh, awesome.  Nice way to start the day.  It's just, uh, amazing to have you in here.  When we heard you were coming in, we were all just, uh, giddy.  Like a bunch of dumb kids.  If I could use the word giddy.  Yeah. 
[03:05:00]  Well, he hasn't seen your film and cancer through it, but the rest of us were obviously very  excited.  We walked over here.  He was already here.  And then Jimmy sat down with him and immediately started bonding about, you know, Hollywood  and stuff.  Well, you know what it is?  It's because, uh, when I was in Pittsburgh recently shooting, uh, the Kevin Smith film.  Oh, yes.  Jimmy, yes.  We were in Monroeville and they would say, this is where, uh, uh, George shot so much  of his stuff.  And so I figured that, you know, uh, men of our similar ilk, just talk about show business.  I sound like Fredo when I talk about it.  He's going to go learn casino business. 
[03:05:30]  And don't forget, uh, Vinnie Brandt, of course, uh, he would appear in the stress factory in  front of what I believe must be a Japanese audience.  Oh, very good.  The silence thing.  I did go one second to get that.  Uh, go on.  No, I mean it.  Go.  It's an old classic vaudeville joke.  But, uh, you are a legend and we were really psyched in.  I forgot what a big fan you are, Danny.  Any final words?  Will it?  I think we should let Danny, because Danny is, is the biggest fan.  We should let you close out the interview with something, a statement maybe. 
[03:06:00]  Yeah.  How about a statement?  Something that.  Throw the paper away.  Speak from the heart.  That's right.  All right.  I like your movies.  That's it.  I like your movies.  All right, Danny.  I'm George Romero, and I approve of this.  Great.  That's good.  Wow.  No need to get overly emotional in moments.  Thank you so much.  Thank you, guys.  Absolutely.  Thank you.  Pleasure meeting you.  Great fun.  Really, really fun.  Take a break so we can take pictures.  For God's sake.  Don't go yet.  No.  I'm not going.  I want to try the glasses on.  The famous glasses myself. 
[03:06:30]  Bye, guys.  We'll continue in just a bit.  Opie and Anthony.  Thank you.  Let me tell you something.  Whenever you hear change, big change in Washington, we need change.  It's socialism.  I've had it.  I've had it with Democrats and liberals and people with this dream, this goddamn false dream that everyone's going to share.  Go to Russia.  Goddamn communists. 
[03:07:00]  They're all communists.  The commies are back from the 80s.  It's the new, improved 21st century communists.  This country is never a place where somebody comes and goes, take care of me.  When the frick did that happen?  It's a place that you work your ass off and you might make it.  Some people will make it.  Some people won't.  Jesus Christ.  It's not frigging Russia.  Goddamn communists. 
[03:07:30]  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  I am the world wolf.  I like to make world wolf movies.  That was a lot of fun.  George Romero in studio with the Opie and Anthony show.  Very cool.  I want to thank Vinnie Brandt from the Stress Factory for his insight. 
[03:08:00]  I did next to nothing.  During that last segment.  It was amazing.  We were having problems with the phones, too.  They kept doing that thing they do here once in a while.  That look where you're under water.  Like the whales are trying to communicate.  Yeah.  So if I cut anybody off or stepped on you, my apologies.  It wasn't to be a dick.  We got Bill Burr calling in.  He wants to talk about the Super Bowl.  Fuck Bill Burr!  Oh, he wants to talk about the Super Bowl, huh?  He's got to be bummed. 
[03:08:30]  Oh, he's got to be.  We were trying to get him on yesterday when it mattered.  But we'll see how it works.  It's old hat.  And then we got our old pal, Bob Saget, checking in.  He wants to promote.  Fuck Bob Saget!  He wants to promote one versus 100.  Fuck one versus 100!  Which makes me think that somebody won the big prize, and that's why we...  Ooh!  ...are going to help him promote it.  That's my new character.  It doesn't care about nothing, guy.  Yeah.  McFly gets it.  This show is great.  Last week you had cherries being thrown at assholes, and he spelled holes, W-H-O-L-E-S. 
[03:09:00]  And today, a great interview.  Thanks for a great radio.  Hey, anyone else read the Britney Spears shit?  Oh my God.  Very interesting stuff.  Her mom had to give a bunch of statements in court about this Sam Lufty, who's acting  as Britney's manager.  They want to put Britney in a coma.  In a medical coma.  A medically induced coma? 
[03:09:30]  To fix her brain.  Yeah, they say...  They're saying that she's so fucked up that to treat her with the medicine they want  to treat her with, it would be best if she was in a medically induced coma.  Wow.  That's a little excessive.  She is really fucked up.  And the mom's getting involved, and some of the stuff she's claiming in court, just amazing.  Lynn Spears?  That's her name, right?  Yep.  Did I say Jamie?  Because that's her father, right?  Her father has a girl's name.  And it's spelled like a girl, too.  This past Monday, Britney's father, Jamie, and I, meaning Britney's mom, in separate 
[03:10:00]  cars, went to Britney's house in Beverly Hills because we had heard news reports that Britney  had just been in a big fight with Osama Lufty, a.k.a.  Sam Lufty, the man who has inserted himself into my daughter's life, home, and finances,  and that she was crying.  We were very concerned about her safety.  And some of the allegations against this guy, amazing, how he was feeding her drugs.  He took her phone chargers.  He ripped the house phone out of the wall because he didn't want her communicating with 
[03:10:30]  the family.  I also heard, back to Britney's mom, I also heard during the evening that during Britney's  and Sam's fight that evening, Sam had told Britney that she was an unfit mother, a piece  of trash, and a whore, that she cares more about Adnan, her current boyfriend, than she  cares about her kids, and that she does not deserve her kids.  Britney then came back to the house with Adnan, who was also a paparazzi.  Sam then told Jackie and me that we needed to do whatever he tells us.  I objected. 
[03:11:00]  He then told me, I'm the one who spends 24-7 with your daughter.  I sleep in cars outside her house so she can't leave.  Sam then said, you people throw everyone under the bus.  If you don't listen to me, I'm going to make your name shit in the papers.  Sam told Jackie and me to tell Adnan to leave Britney alone and to get the fuck out of the  house.  Jackie refused.  Sam then said to tell Britney that Adnan is gay.  Whoa.  Yeah.  This Sam Lofty is obsessed with Britney Spears. 
[03:11:30]  Britney then became very agitated and could not stop moving.  She cleaned the house.  She changed her clothes many times.  She also changed her three-dog's clothes many times.  This is Britney's mom observing the whole scene at Britney's house.  Britney spoke to me in a tone and with the level of understanding of a very young girl.  This is Britney's mom.  Interesting.  Britney then picked up a bottle of pills and read part of the label and asked us,  What does insomnia mean?  Sam told her that the pills will help her stay awake.  Is this interesting? 
[03:12:00]  Want me to continue?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's amazing.  This is all from court documents.  Britney's mom.  Sam told Jackie and me that he grinds up Britney's pills, which were on the counter and included  Risperdal and Seroquel, something like that.  If we know what those drugs are, maybe someone can help us out there.  He told us that he puts them in her food and that that was the reason she had been quiet  for the last three days.  She had been sleeping.  He told us that the doctor who is treating her now is trying to get her into a sleep induced  coma so that they could give her the drugs to heal her brain. 
[03:12:30]  Wow.  Sam then encouraged us to sit down on a sofa and to do tequila shots.  This is, of course, once again, Britney's mom pretty much telling everyone what happened  in that house when they were trying to do this intervention thing.  Jackie, I don't know who Jackie is.  This name comes up a lot.  Jackie and I said we did not want to.  Britney seemed to follow our lead.  Sam then got some wine out and said, let's all do toast with wine. 
[03:13:00]  Britney said that she didn't want to.  She wanted a pretty glass.  Sam found a glass of a stem and poured wine for Britney when we were not looking.  Britney refused to drink her wine and asked to drink mine.  A little while later, Britney came downstairs.  She seemed agitated again and told us that she wanted to go to Rite Aid for lipsticks.  It was now past midnight.  Wow.  She's fucking nuts.  A lot of interventions start with shots of tequila.  Yeah.  We entered Rite Aid and Britney chose her lipstick.  The manager said it is dangerous out there, which it was. 
[03:13:30]  When Britney gave the cashier her credit card, the cashier told her it was not working.  At another point, we're almost done.  At another point that evening, Sam bragged to me that he is the one who receives Britney's checks  and that one of them was for me.  I told Sam that I hadn't gotten any checks from Britney.  Sam then told me that they are in his car.  He told me that if he weren't in the house to give Britney her medicine, she would kill herself.  Then he said to me, if you try to get rid of me, she'll be dead and I'll piss on her grave.  Sam wanted to care very deeply. 
[03:14:00]  At one point during the night, Sam was screaming at me and Britney said to me,  Sam treats me like that.  Then she picked up the house phone and said, look at the phone.  It doesn't work.  Sam then blamed the dead phone on Britney.  Jackie spoke up and said to Sam, you said you cut the phone wire.  While we're at Rite Aid, Britney went in and out of her British accent.  This is Britney's mom.  That's hysterical.  She just talks with a British accent for no reason.  Jamie came to pick me up the next morning.  And that would be Britney's father picking up Britney's mom, although they're divorced. 
[03:14:30]  Jamie gave Britney a big hug and said to her, baby, you're OK.  Britney said, I'm fine.  Then burst into tears.  So a lot of very interesting allegations going on in the Britney case.  She's lost her mind.  Literally.  And Sir Qualler, if I'm pronouncing it right, helps with bipolar disorder.  Thank you for that on Instant Feedback.  Great.  Welcome a brand new face to Pal Talk. 
[03:15:00]  Who?  Fuck the face.  Welcome her ass.  Jandy.  J-A-N-D-I-3.  Hi.  What are you talking about?  I don't see.  She showed her.  She showed her.  Her hiney.  Mine hiney.  And I have to say, it's magnificent.  I didn't see it.  Holy shit.  Dan, how about we put that on one of the big screens?  We have 15 million fucking flat screens.  I rarely welcome people onto Pal Talk, but my goodness gracious, you get a fond hello. 
[03:15:30]  Cherry Darcher died.  Accidental overdose just coming in.  Overdose resulted from abuse of several prescription meds.  Which one?  Breaking news.  Accidental overdose.  Sorry I had to interrupt you, but it was flying by the screen.  Breaking news.  Overdose resulted from abuse of several prescription meds.  Oh, okay.  So it was prescription meds and an accidental overdose for Heath Ledger. 
[03:16:00]  Good for him.  So whoever got that won the pot.  She's Cherry Darch's ass girl.  Who?  What's her username?  Girl on the...  J-A-N-D-I-3.  Is that the one you really, really, really, really...  Yes, I was getting annoyed when anybody was in the way of that ass.  You really want to get into her high name?  A premiere...  Here it goes.  She's showing it.  There it is.  Wow.  Holy fuck.  Vinny, what do you think?  Look at that.  That is quite an ass.  Look at that ass.  That actually makes me angry. 
[03:16:30]  That is an angering ass.  Vinny's all about the family values.  Don't ask him questions like that, please.  Oh, shit.  You're a faggot.  Look at the fucking thing.  Look, I can tell you that.  It's like a work of art.  You can comment on the beauty of a work of art.  Yeah, I can say that.  It's nice because my wife did not have XM.  That is a fine ass.  And it's a little bizarre.  I don't know why people do that.  That's very bizarre.  Was she in studio?  Why is that bizarre?  She's got a little halter top on and tiny little panties,  and she's throwing off her ass to the folks. 
[03:17:00]  Jimmy.  Oh.  Would you?  Axel's making the face Jimmy makes.  Like a rat face.  Like a rat face.  You're right.  Smelling some cheese.  She put it over my nose and she'd go,  now I walked a long distance and I'd go, hush now.  No, I wasn't able to shower last night.  I hope that doesn't.  It's a rat face. 
[03:17:30]  Can we get back to Vinny, though?  Why do you find that bizarre?  I think it's weird that, for some reason,  I think it's weird that people would just jump on a computer screen  and show their ass.  I don't know why.  But they're safe.  They're in their homes.  Yeah.  He's a dad.  He has a daughter.  Yeah, it's also that I have that whole fear.  Your fear is that your daughter will be one of these girls  when they grow up.  Four daughters, you know.  Right.  I mean, you've got to make sure they're on my...  Dude, I'm still holding out hope that I'm going to be a father.  I can't even imagine having a freaking daughter. 
[03:18:00]  And you have four?  I have four.  And I'm going to tell you right now,  nothing is worse than a 16-year-old daughter.  Fucking mind abusive.  It's just...  It's horrendous being around them.  16, huh?  16 is a bitch age.  I've got an 18-year-old.  She wakes up in the morning,  ah!  You know.  Merry Christmas!  Ah!  Ah!  It's like I sacrificed my entire life  so I could hear, ah!  Christmas morning. 
[03:18:30]  Angry and everything.  Angry and non...  Talk non-stop.  Your fucking head will explode.  She'll talk for two hours and say nothing.  It's like you're sitting there going,  I couldn't even say, uh-huh,  because there was nothing to, uh-huh.  It's fucking horrendous.  I'm telling you, fucking torture.  Wow.  I have one boy who's a kick in the cock a different way.  I think he smoked pot in my house  when I was changing a baby,  four o'clock in the afternoon.  That's ridiculous, right?  But at least that you can wrap your mind around. 
[03:19:00]  An 18-year-old daughter is just non-stop miserable.  My 22-year-old is miserable.  My seven and four-year-old, very nice, happy.  When does it change?  What age?  Where they go from daddy's little girl  to go fuck yourself, dad?  Uh, my oldest, up until 14, was great.  From 14 to this very minute, complete bag of dicks.  From 14 to 22?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  That's a whole decade?  Oh, and let me tell you, I don't even know.  Do you yell at her and go,  you know the sacrifices I made? 
[03:19:30]  Yes, yes.  And it's not like they don't have shit.  It's not like we're not eating dirt sandwiches  like the people in Haiti.  Dirt cookies.  Yeah, dirt cookies.  We have nice shit, and they're just not happy people.  My son is more happy,  but even, you know, all teenagers just really...  Suck.  They suck.  They really suck.  I've heard that over and over again.  Yeah, it's not fun.  That's too bad.  And I'm worried about one of them doing this on Paltalk  is really what the point is,  because that's the ultimate way to say fuck you to dad.  Right.  You know, because not that she's doing anything bad. 
[03:20:00]  This girl's really in the equivalent of a bathing suit.  She's really not whoring it up too bad.  Well, you're a dad.  That's how a dad would look at it, though.  Yeah.  Dad would look at it like it's not.  Well, ask and she'll whore it up for you.  I mean, if any of you.  Geez, I mean, stop talking about around the bush here.  I was going to say bush and butt at the same time.  Let's say hi to Bill Burr, the great Bill Burr.  Bill!  Hey, what's up, guys?  Sorry to make your way.  We were trying to get to that Brittany stuff,  and we went long with George Romero.  No, man, that stuff was funny.  I've actually been on hold. 
[03:20:30]  I kind of forgot I was on hold.  I thought I was just listening to the show.  Yeah, sorry.  What do you think of Brittany?  What's that?  I'll tell you, after that Super Bowl,  I could have used some of those meds.  Oh, my God.  That's right.  Big Pats fan.  That's what I was thinking.  Bill Burr has got to be beside himself.  You know, the Pats went into that.  They were supposed to win.  It was destiny.  Can I tell you something?  Honestly, I thought after the Colts game in October,  I kind of had this awful feeling that we were going to lose to the Colts 
[03:21:00]  in the AFC Championship game.  But once they were out of it,  the only other team I was kind of nervous about was the Cowboys.  And I don't know.  I was kind of – I don't know.  But I still – I definitely – I thought we were going to eke out a win  against the Giants.  Yeah.  You know what sucks?  It was one of the best Super Bowls ever.  Uh-huh.  And, I mean, and this is another thing, too.  Like, I'm – the Giants totally kicked our ass.  I'm one of those guys who are going to be like, you know,  there was no bullshit referee call or anything.  They played fucking awesome. 
[03:21:30]  But, actually, two days after, yesterday was the first day.  It's kind of sunk in.  I was just like 18-0 down the fucking tube.  Yeah, it is, dude.  But you know what?  I mean, and I was rooting very heavily for the Giants.  But, I mean, the Patriots – I mean, I know it sucks that it was a Super Bowl,  but it was just a bad game.  I mean, I know there's no way to spin it to make you feel better.  But even on a shit day, they still only lost by three.  And that's not a consolation.  I don't think it was a bad game.  I think the Giants just figured out how to get to Brady finally. 
[03:22:00]  Well, again, it's a game.  No, no, no.  You know what?  The Colts – the Cowboys were the first ones who exposed our defense.  You know, we won, like, 48-24.  And I thought it was going to be our defense.  Like, what happened was, like, the whole NFL,  because I think Belichick was running up the score,  they just started going, well, no, they're not going to do that to us.  And the whole league was trying to figure out our offense.  But I really thought it was going to be a defense that was going to make us lose.  But our defense played awesome.  The Giants were just – their D was, like, the best –  it reminded me of the Bears in – what was that? 
[03:22:30]  Super Bowl 20?  Way the hell back.  It looked like they had, like, 40 guys in the field.  Once we couldn't do those quick screen passes to Wes Welker, I was like, uh-oh.  There's a problem here.  Yeah.  That would be bad.  What did you –  Eli, I never thought he had that last drive in him, so –  Oh, my God.  What did you think –  Yeah, what did you think when the Pats scored  and there were only a couple of minutes left?  Well, as we were going down the field,  I was praying the clock was going to tick.  Yeah, absolutely.  Like, you know what I mean?  Because I just didn't like it. 
[03:23:00]  You know what?  It was – everybody got pissed at me when I was at the Super Bowl party.  It was some pass that Eli hit, I think it was in the third quarter  for, like, 25 yards, and I just blurted out, we're going to lose.  Oh, shit.  You can feel it.  You know, like when the – like, they were just a team of destiny.  Dude, when you've got a 300-pound guy falls on a fumble for our team  and somehow they still end up with the ball, that's the kind of stuff, like –  That'll try to not –  You're just like, okay, I don't think it's our day, man. 
[03:23:30]  But, I mean, I'm just saying, like, the Giants, I mean,  they just straight-up kicked our ass, man.  They played unbelievable.  You know, when Brady scored near the end there, I didn't feel –  I didn't feel like the Pats had it still.  And then they showed a shot of Michael Strahan giving a pep talk to his guys,  and something hit me like, oh, boy, oh, boy.  They want this more than the Pats or something like that.  And then, of course, when Eli made that –  you can't even say he made the amazing pass.  It was that catch where the guy caught the amazing pass 
[03:24:00]  because he broke away from – I mean, they were grabbing at him.  Oh, yeah, you're right about that.  He was kind of in the grass, but I'm glad they didn't call that late in the Super Bowl.  But then Eli Manning, you know, passed –  and the guy catching him with his helmet, one hand falling backwards.  I said to myself, there's no way the Giants lose this now after that catch.  No fucking –  That was just an instant classic.  I'll tell you what's funny is, like, before the Super Bowl, 
[03:24:30]  I maybe got three emails from Giants fans who were actually saying that they were going to win.  But, dude, the second they won –  I should save some of them and come in and read them to you.  Everybody all was saying, what up now, bitch?  Everybody was saying, dude, what did I say, guy?  Dude, I called it.  I called it.  It's like, what the fuck are you talking about?  It was the first email I got from you.  Yeah, I thought the Giants were going to lose.  I mean –  And when the Patriots scored with 242 left, I was hating them. 
[03:25:00]  I was like, you know what?  This is why they fucking win everything.  They're unbeatable.  But you know what I thought?  I thought during the game, anytime they cut to Brady,  after the first quarter, anytime they cut to him, he looked nervous.  Yes, he did.  He did not look like he was in command at all.  We said that too, Vinny.  Yeah, I did.  Something didn't seem right.  Like he had the flu or he was scared.  I mean, how many times –  What did the guy –  I mean, he definitely –  He didn't have his best day or whatever.  But, dude, when it came down to it, the guy drove the team down the field.  He scored the touchdown. 
[03:25:30]  I mean, that last drive, he would be supposed to play defense too.  Yeah, Brady did his job in the end.  You're absolutely right.  Yeah, but you know what?  You've got to score more than that in the Super Bowl.  I mean, I'm surprised it was such a low-scoring game.  I thought it was going to be 31-28 Giants.  That's what I predicted all along.  But, Vinny, didn't you notice what the Giants did, man?  They only – first of all, they only lost to the Patriots by three.  They beat the Cowboys on the road.  They beat the Packers on the road.  It's one of the most undeniable championships ever.  And I don't know why –  Like I was saying, you know, take the Giants and the under.  I thought the Patriots were still going to win. 
[03:26:00]  But people just had those first six, seven games in their head  where we were scoring 50 on, like, the fucking Buffalo Bills.  And they kind of forgot that, you know, the Eagles almost beat us.  The Ravens almost beat us.  I swear to God, man, I kind of wish we lost one in the regular season  to take the pressure off.  The only good thing about us losing was that I think it kind of squashed –  I don't know, I haven't watched ESPN for the last couple days,  but it kind of – I think it squashed that whole –  that crap that was coming out about the Patriots filming the Rams before the games. 
[03:26:30]  You guys hear about it?  No, you know what?  It hasn't squashed it.  They're still looking into it.  Yeah.  And they're –  That is the stupidest thing ever.  Even if they did it, right?  Let's just say for argument they did it.  Isn't that on the Rams?  I mean, you're in the Super Bowl.  Why don't you get some fucking security?  You know?  I'm missing the final run-through of your game plan.  Hey, who's that guy up in the stands?  Ah, that's just some make-a-wish kid with the Patriots hat.  And a video tape.  You know what I mean? 
[03:27:00]  It's like the videotaping caused Kurt Warner to throw off his back foot,  a pick-six, you know,  and a Terry kicking a 48-yard field goal to win it because you taped the game.  It's such bullshit.  Yeah, right on.  Yeah, the Giants won, what, 11 in a row on the road?  Dude, yeah, they were awesome.  I think it was 11 in a row on the road.  Wow.  Insane.  That's like the best defense, I think,  the most dominating defense I've seen.  I don't know, maybe because I remember the Patriots getting their ass kicked by the Bears, 
[03:27:30]  but it really reminded me of that.  Jesus Christ, do they have like 20 guys on the field?  They did once.  They got a penalty for that.  12 guys on the field.  I thought they looked awesome in the opening drive.  When you hold the ball nine minutes on the opening drive of the Super Bowl,  I thought, you know what?  This team can win the game.  And I didn't care if the Giants made it until they beat Dallas Cowboys.  And instead of just saying Eli Manning beat the Cowboys,  I had to say, oh, Tony Romo was distracted by Jessica.  That pissed me off.  Well, I got to say this.  About the Dallas game, Giants played well, but Dallas gave them that game 
[03:28:00]  because their defense was disgustingly sloppy.  The tackling was fucking horrendous.  When you watch that, I watched that Super Bowl,  some of the open field tackles that both teams made,  that's the way you tackle a guy.  And Dallas, the Amani Tuma, the opening drive touchdown,  they fucking, the guys, it's like, this is not flag football, you cunts.  This is a fucking playoff game.  They deserve to lose, and Dallas would not have beaten the Patriots. 
[03:28:30]  They were not well coached enough to beat the Patriots  to be as disciplined on defense.  Dallas would have lost to the Patriots.  I'm still not convinced that Romo's a big-game quarterback.  That's just me.  All right.  All right, Bill, everything else all right?  Yeah, everything else is cool, man.  Other than 18-0 down the fucking tube.  Yeah, everything's pretty bright.  Bill, lemons to lemonade, 18-1's okay.  Yeah.  It's the last one game.  There's something really funny about that level of disappointment, 
[03:29:00]  even though I'm in it.  I mean, if I saw it happen to another team,  I would have laughed my ass off,  so I can't get too pissed at the email.  You can't even spin it.  I mean, it's just got to hurt, like, just very deeply.  I was in the cell the other night with Nick DiPaolo,  and actually last night, and Ben Bailey.  And Nick, you know, Nick is just so annoyed.  He goes, fuck it, they're still going to go down in the record books.  And Ben Bailey goes, yeah, as the second-best team of the season.  First of all, why would you say that?  You should have just...  Anytime you get your ass kicked, you've got to go to... 
[03:29:30]  You've just got to give it up to the other team,  or you just prolong the ass-kicking.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, Nick didn't handle it well.  Bob Kelly, I think his car is parked with a fucking hose in the exhaust.  All right, I shut everybody up with that bad attempt at a joke slash real wish.  He checked in for, like, what, two minutes the other day?  No, it probably strikes me as the kind of guy who dresses all in, like, Patriots gear  when he actually watches the game.  Oh, yeah.  Look, it's a Patriots blimp. 
[03:30:00]  All right, Bill, we're heading out early today, so...  Okay, hey, guys, I'm actually coming in town next week.  I'm doing Letterman, so I think I'm coming in there Monday.  Wow, look at you.  Nice.  Yeah, cool.  Come on.  Yeah, I bought myself a nice...  I'm going to be on TV suit.  Good Bill.  Being a fancy man like little Jimmy.  Yeah, I had the suit, but next time I do J, I'm probably not going to wear the suit.  I'm going to be nutty.  Oh, yeah?  You're going to come out in a hoodie?  Yeah, something crazy just to show them that I'm in touch with the young people.  Use young people slang. 
[03:30:30]  I'll just keep sounding.  Yeah, just have a little scruff on your face.  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring.  So I'm sniffling, guys.  Phone.  Hello?  What happened?  Oh.  Do you hate the recording that calls you?  How could that possibly be a courtesy call?  From who?  It's a non-courtesy.  That's so non-courtesy. 
[03:31:00]  Anyway, sorry, Bill.  All right, so come on in Monday.  All right, guys, I'll see you next week.  All right, have a safe trip.  Bill Burr, everyone.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Yeah.  That's cool.  It was very funny to make a wish, kid.  Yeah.  Patriots.  Funny bastard.  Anyway, I got a note.  It just said Opie.  It was in an envelope.  Oh, that's mysterious.  We've had such a busy show here at XM.  Finally opened it during the break.  It says, Opie, please do us a favor and tell your weird intern, Adam, who we met yesterday. 
[03:31:30]  Yes, we did.  For the first time.  We kind of brought him to everyone's attention for the most part yesterday.  Not to pull up a chair uncomfortably close to the glass outside the studio and then sit  there and stare at us while we're doing our show.  It creeps us out.  Thanks, Ron and Fez.  Holy shit.  Does anyone have anything on this?  Isn't he getting us in Dutch with our favorite show, if I may use those words?  I thought in Dutch was good.  I don't know what that means.  No, it's bad, right? 
[03:32:00]  No.  Getting you in Dutch.  In Dutch is good.  No, it's bad.  I'm telling you, he's in Dutch.  I bet it, Jimmy.  What?  In Dutch is good.  When you say I'm in Dutch with somebody, doesn't it mean you're bad with them?  I can't even acknowledge that a grown man would think it means good.  It's good.  I'm telling you right now.  In Dutch means good.  It means bad.  No, it doesn't.  Google it.  You're going to be in Dutch.  Please.  It means trouble.  I don't think it does.  I know you don't.  You'll be in Dutch.  Yeah.  Anthony's going to Google you.  He's in Dutch with you.  It means bad. 
[03:32:30]  You're the epitome of foolishness.  You'll be in Dutch with the audience, as they call you a blithering idiot.  You're a horse's ass personified.  You're the personification of stupidity.  You guys blew my great Google joke.  What was the Google joke?  I heard.  Well, fucking Vinny goes to Anthony, Google it.  And I said, no, Anthony wants to Google your daughters.  Oh, jeez.  Come on.  Hurtful.  It's hurtful.  Well, we have a rule never to do the same joke twice, but I just can't help myself.  I was proud of that line. 
[03:33:00]  It's a rule.  Anyway, here's Adam.  Adam, you're creeping out Ron and Fez.  What happened yesterday?  Well, the bleachers were moved in here, and the chairs were also out there as well to  make room for the bleachers, and I was waiting, because the bin was in here, and I was just  sitting there watching their show.  From uncomfortably close to the glass, apparently.  Did they point this out during their show?  They didn't point it out.  Well, Mr. Bennington kind of stared at me, but, you know, I... 
[03:33:30]  You are an odd fellow.  You're a little bit weird.  In Dutch, you got it?  Well, this wacky source, Merriam-Webster, has, in Dutch means, quote, in disfavor or in trouble.  Okay, it's bad.  Fuck.  How do you think it meant good?  What do you mean it's good?  I don't know.  As opposed to good?  Yeah.  What's double Dutch?  All right, Adam. 
[03:34:00]  Yes.  So, you're noticing he's a little weird, right, Vinny?  He is definitely a little odd.  Is that an accent?  Why were you staring at the Rana Fez show?  I was waiting for the bin, and I was waiting for them to go to break, and I was just, you  know, lounging casually on the chair, like, just normally.  Reminds me of an Adam Sandler character.  Ah, yeah.  You really do.  Wow.  Yeah.  So, Sam, you got anything on this?  No.  Oh, man.  He's even weirder.  Holy shit.  Ron and Fez actually wrote a note. 
[03:34:30]  Art Garfunkel's kid.  He wrote a note.  I apologize to Ron and Fez that I creeped them out, and I won't do it again.  So, are you going to tell us your deep, dark secret yet?  What?  No.  I don't even know.  Touched by a priest?  No.  No.  My priest and I are, you know, pretty cool.  I would...  I started thinking about you yesterday, because I went on record and said, I think you're gay  and you don't know, but I'm not even thinking that anymore.  I'm thinking that something happened to you.  I'm going with molestation now. 
[03:35:00]  Yeah, it could be.  No.  I'm going with molestation.  Molestation.  Well, Vinny, he's a virgin.  He's 22.  22.  Has never kissed a girl.  Never kissed a girl?  Have you thought about playing a nerdy zombie for George Romero?  You've never kissed a girl ever?  No.  Do you want to?  I've had chances, but they're really awkward, and I kind of like...  I've had chances.  Always awkward.  You have to make that move.  A little awkward. 
[03:35:30]  A little awkward.  Sometimes it gets a little awkward when I kiss a girl, it's getting a little awkward.  No, I'm just kind of socially...  You hit it right on the head.  I'm socially awkward, and maybe socially retarded.  Were you molested?  No.  No.  Are you sure?  I'm positive.  But something's going on.  Yeah, something definitely happened.  I'm not thinking the gay thing anymore, because I really went home and thought about this  one.  I'm thinking molestation. 
[03:36:00]  He has a made-up girlfriend.  Did you go to the high school prom?  Did you go to the prom?  I didn't go to any dances.  That doesn't shock me.  I don't like to dance.  Well, no.  A lot of times I played sports, and I had a job after practice, and I just worked and  did my own loving parents.  What sport were you in?  Were you in track?  Cross-country baseball basketball.  Cross-country baseball basketball.  That's a weird sport.  I can't even see you playing basketball.  That must be hard to play. 
[03:36:30]  Cross-country, I believe.  Baseball, I can...  Yeah, basketball.  You know, I was like...  Ball boy.  I was like the 10th guy.  I was the water boy.  I'm going to guess something else.  For the football team.  I'm going to guess something else.  Your parents are not together anymore, right?  No, my parents are married, and I'm...  In a loving leeway still.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Definitely.  I got a little sister, and she's cool.  Spaghetti against the wall when you were growing up.  None like that.  No American beauty stuff.  Did you ever...  Did your father ever talk to you about girls?  Like, in fact, you know, you got to get laid?  Yeah.  Did your dad ever talk about pussy? 
[03:37:00]  My dad, my dad...  Yeah.  Well, my dad was kind of like...  He was kind of like the ladies' man back in his day.  Another SNL character?  The ladies' man.  I think he...  This was like a karmatic payback.  Yes, and I think that he's kind of...  You know, he understands that, you know, I'm having troubles.  Oh, no.  And he...  And, you know, he...  Embarrassed by it.  He gives me like...  Of course he is.  He raised an inept fruit.  Yeah.  Sorry.  I was joking for that, guys.  Thank you.  Thank you.  I'm going back to gay. 
[03:37:30]  Now I'm going back to gay.  What does your dad do for a living?  He works at Ford.  Yeah, he's a man's man.  That's right.  He's...  Modeling agents?  Selling trucks every day.  No, he works on the assembly lines.  I heard it.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  And he's a manly...  He's...  He's...  Yeah, he's quite...  A little King of Scotland stuff going on here?  No.  No, hold on.  What did you mean?  In other words, like the father of some...  Boom.  Boom.  Oh, shut up.  No.  I really don't like you.  What do you mean?  Boom.  A puddle of AIDS from Jersey writes, 
[03:38:00]  I heard Adam is dating George Glass.  Oh, yeah.  Are you dating George Glass?  That's my boyfriend, George Glass.  No.  No, huh?  No.  But I...  When are you going to give up your secret?  Something happened to you.  I have no idea.  I have no idea.  I'm just very, very inept.  Never kiss a girl at 22 is bizarre.  Inept people don't realize they're inept, is what it is.  They're just inept.  Like, you're saying you're inept and you're a social misfit and you just don't know how 
[03:38:30]  to act around a girl.  Yeah.  You should be able to turn that around.  Keep your chin up.  Yeah.  But you can't.  You're part of a successful radio show.  I am.  Pussy flying through the doors in this place.  What do you do?  Yeah.  All right.  By that, I mean cocks.  Do you have any girl that you want to date right now?  Like, you see a girl around the other guy.  I want to date that girl.  No.  No.  Nothing.  There was one back in the day I had a big crush on and she kind of... 
[03:39:00]  Wednesday.  Yeah.  She kind of, like, rejected me.  Ah.  That's it.  But, but, but that's...  How is mom?  That's it.  You have to get used to that.  You have to get used to that feeling and get past it.  Norton did.  And now he's got a girlfriend.  Yeah.  You got to get past the rejection thing.  Well, I am past that, but that was, like, the only girl that I liked.  Hold on.  Don't do it.  You raised the girlfriend example.  You're right.  I did get past it.  Now I have a girlfriend.  Stay where you are.  You better off.  You better off jerking off into a napkin and crying yourself to sleep. 
[03:39:30]  Trust me, kid.  Can I jump in here?  Hector V is sticking up for me and I appreciate it.  I'm pissed.  Opie pointed out the Adam Sandler thing yesterday.  Sorry, Opie.  Guess you're right.  Just a button pusher.  Yeah, half the time, these guys don't listen to what I have to say because they don't think  I'm actually going to say anything that's relevant to the radio show.  What happened?  Who doesn't listen?  Pretty much everybody.  What happened?  That's not true.  You say things at weird times.  Like, if I don't hear something, I didn't hear it.  Like, it's not going to be a dick.  I broke the Adam Sandler thing yesterday.  Oh, you did?  Yeah. 
[03:40:00]  All right.  How come no one ever brought the Adam Sandler thing up before today?  That was a fucking freeze company joke.  All right, Adam, we're going to go home.  Yeah.  Because you're not ready to give up your dark secret.  I don't have any real secrets.  But there's something that puts you down this road where you haven't kissed a girl and you're  22 years old.  What age was the big rejection by this girl you liked?  Everyone's been rejected by a girl, though.  By 22, you're doing some of that fucking.  It was this summer. 
[03:40:30]  You know, that was my...  Easy for you to say.  Was it like a vicious put-down or did she just say no?  No, she just kind of, like, nodded her head and, like, it was really awkward and we kind  of just, like, parted ways and then...  I got it.  I finally got it.  Very, very, very small dick.  No.  He said over six. 
[03:41:00]  Yeah, but that was lying.  Because he knows the average is six.  He's uncomfortable with his tiny, tiny little penis.  No, no.  Kind of like you almost have, like, an innie and you're like, you know what?  I better not kiss girls because I know where that might lead to.  And then I got to put my pants down and show them that I'm hung like an acorn.  Problem.  Problem.  Problem.  Just...  Is that the problem?  Small penis?  No, I have a...  Let's go around the room.  I'm going to say small penis. 
[03:41:30]  Anthony?  What do you think his issue is that he's 20...  Gay.  Gay?  Definitely.  I think he's just a shy fag with a small dick.  First base, second base, third base.  Over-domineering father.  What?  Just an over-domineering guy.  Probably a good...  Father's not a ladies' man.  Probably played sports.  Successful.  People respect him.  Fucking great Santini or something.  Or maybe an over-dominating mother who didn't like the fact that the father was a ladies' man  and so castrated this...  Ah.  That could be it. 
[03:42:00]  Yeah.  Did the rancher make you perform fellatio or did he sodomize you?  No.  I don't know.  I'm just...  I'm kind of like my own worst enemy and, you know, I'm on...  Like I said before, I'm uncomfortable in my own skin and I need to try to work out of that.  Fucking sound like Adam Sandler.  You know?  Yeah.  Oh my god, that's funny.  I didn't even notice that.  Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you.  All right.  And Dan, you want to jump in? 
[03:42:30]  You got a mic in front of you.  What do you think his issue is?  I just think he doesn't know how to act like a human being.  Like he just...  Yeah.  Way to bring it home, Sam.  He doesn't know how to be a person.  Yeah.  He'll go for any reaction.  Like any attention is good.  Okay.  No matter what it is.  Were you a weirdo in school?  Like in elementary school?  Were you the weirdo kid that everyone made fun of?  No.  Why?  Were you student council president?  No.  Who were you?  I was a safety.  I'd crossed children through...  Oh, maybe a pedophile. 
[03:43:00]  No, no, I was...  Safety patrol and you pat him on the ass going across the street.  He held up the stop sign and he was fired for coming in his pants.  Hey, little boy, come here.  Your penis is my size.  No, I was in high school.  I was really under the radar in middle school.  Weirdo.  You've kissed infants.  Are you on drugs?  Was I...  Prescription right now?  No, I don't take any drugs, don't drink, don't smoke.  Therapy? 
[03:43:30]  Huh?  Don't drink, don't smoke.  Are you in therapy?  No, I did a little bit of counseling back in the day.  Yeah?  Yeah.  For what?  What was this day?  Like a couple years ago.  Oh.  And it was for what?  For depression.  Dude, you were a little depressed.  Well, you know, things were happening and, you know...  Things were happening.  Yeah.  What do you mean?  What was happening?  Like happening.  Well, you know, some things in my life.  I, you know, a couple people died and, you know, I had to just... 
[03:44:00]  You killed them?  No.  No.  You're teasing, of course.  No.  Family members?  Who died?  Older?  One of my coaches from baseball.  Hilarious.  And my grandpa.  Oh, grandpa.  Who taught me the game of baseball.  So.  It was a whole baseball death thing.  So, you know, it just...  That's terrific. 
[03:44:30]  That's terrific.  Was it traumatic for you when the scooter died?  Did you go in more and outside the money store?  No.  I just got a note handed to me, and this is very creepy now that I think about it.  Oh, no.  He has none of his own opinions.  He agrees with anything.  Hmm.  You've pretty much said yes to everything you've suggested.  He's Zeleg.  He's Earl.  He's the white Earl.  Thank you, E-Rock.  How'd your parents die? 
[03:45:00]  Adam and Earl should get together and do a radio show.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  An awful, non-opinionated radio show.  So, you went to therapy for the people dying?  You know, I just talked about it and kind of, you know, paved things out a little bit.  You didn't talk about your, like, inability to get a girl or anything like that?  Uh, we, we, uh, we brushed over that issue.  Did your therapist touch you?  No, no. 
[03:45:30]  He was a counselor.  He was a good guy.  Yeah.  I bet.  How old was your baseball coach that died?  Uh, he was, uh, 26.  Ooh.  How'd he go?  Uh, car accident, uh, blindsided by a semi.  Yeah.  That sucks.  Hey, Charlie D. writes, uh, he suffers from, just updated.  Uh, he suffers from a loose anus.  Oh, poor boy.  Poor thing.  Oh, God.  But, uh, you know, uh, that's, that's, you know, that's, that's the past. 
[03:46:00]  And I, I'm still, you know, still trying to, you know, go outside my box and do stuff that's,  uh, do stuff that's fun and interesting.  I don't really, I don't really do much.  Let me ask you this.  If you, could you be with a girl?  Like, if someone hired you a prostitute, could you do it?  No.  No.  I don't, I don't, I wouldn't do that.  Why?  Well, because with all the STDs and stuff.  Sometimes you need to just get a little push.  Exactly.  Yeah.  Sometimes you need to just throw in your cock, kid.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, I, I, I understand that. 
[03:46:30]  What about, uh, like a hand job with a rubber?  Well, I, one of, uh, one of my friends who, uh, who is a girl, she bought me a, uh, like  one of those, uh, one of those mouse that, like.  One of those fuck mouse?  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  And, and that, I use it a couple times, uh.  Why don't you say, instead of giving me the fuck mouth, how about I fuck your mouth?  Yeah, but I think that's the message a girl is sending.  Yeah, yeah.  A girl doesn't give you a fuck mouth if she doesn't want to. 
[03:47:00]  It's like you're, you're starving, and a chicken brings you a rubber chicken.  Well, you know, or no, that could be that you're, uh, she, he wanted to fuck her, and  she goes, here, just do this, do this, do this, do this, do this, do this, do this,  it'll listen to you afterwards, just talk to her.  Coke Logic wants him.  Yes, Coke Logic.  Hey, Ant.  Hey, Jimmy.  Hi, buddy.  Did you guys notice that this guy sounds like Adam Sandler?  Ah, shit.  Yeah, it does, man.  Wow.  You know something?  I didn't even notice.  This whole time. 
[03:47:30]  And his name's Adam.  Yes.  Yeah.  Amazing.  All right, Adam.  I, I, I, I was, I went to a counselor, oh, very, very depressed for one hour.  You fuck, uh, mouths.  I tried it out once, and then I was like, or once or twice, and then I was like, you  know, this, this, all right.  And then I just put it in my closet, and, you know, hopefully, uh, mom doesn't find it.  You live it, you live it, I was gonna ask, you live it, your parents?  Uh, no, um, I live, uh, I went to MSU, and I lived with roommates, and I'm living with 
[03:48:00]  my aunt right now in New Rochelle.  They molest you?  No, no.  Okay.  Hopefully mom doesn't find it, hopefully dad doesn't find it and use it, and then put it  back without worshiping it.  Oh, is that, is that like it?  Uh, no, it's, it's a mouth.  Oh, that's a, this is a, this is a, this is a, uh, Eve's pussy.  Yes.  Yeah.  Eve's pussy.  You wanna put your dick in it?  Uh, yeah.  Uh, I'll, uh, I, I, I, I, I'll, you know, I'll give it a test run, you know. 
[03:48:30]  Alright, Adam, you're creeping everyone out.  Yeah, you're a weirdo.  You're definitely a weirdo.  Sorry, guys.  You giving us the willies?  Yeah, just, don't stare at Ron and Fez.  Yes, the heebie-jeebies.  I, I won't.  Please.  We have enough problems with those guys.  Speculation, speculation, speculation, speculation, threat.  That's not an act.  That's, I, we don't know.  We don't know.  You'd have to be a good actor, because that's pretty good.  I kind of, look at him, he, even just him walking.  Yeah, I don't think it's an act.

[03:49:30]  there nude with a trench coat and a weapon in each hand like the Oswald photo.  Very funny.  Uh, Vinny, great appearance, by the way.  Thank you.  It's dressed back in New Brunswick, New Jersey.  Thank you for having me in.  You performing anywhere anytime soon?  I am.  I'm doing a, I'm doing the Tropicana this weekend.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, well, I think so, because they called me yesterday and I have to fill in for somebody.  Okay.  So, and, uh, I'm doing, if not...  Where's that, Atlantic City?  Yeah, Atlantic City, the Tropicana.  Great.  You headlining?  Yeah. 
[03:50:00]  Good.  For Bobby Kephart.  Smokes in the green room.  Does he?  That's horrendous.  I never worked for him.  You never worked for Kephart?  No.  You heard about Ray, right?  Ray what?  Garvey.  What about him?  Oh, Ray is sick.  Is he really?  Yeah, he's real sick.  He's got cancer.  You're kidding, right?  No, no.  You don't usually go, he's sick and he's got a cold.  Yeah, really.  You don't say you hear about Ray if he just has the flow.  It's never good.  Right.  You hear about and then add the name in.  It's never like, oh, yeah, he won the lottery and he's gone, you know?  Oh, no, I didn't hear that. 
[03:50:30]  Yeah, you should call him.  You're tight with Ray, aren't you?  I haven't talked to him in a while, but he's an ex-cop.  Thank you for explaining, Jimmy, because Vinny doesn't understand how to do radio.  There's a million people listening right now.  And guess what?  Every single one of them, except for Jimmy, and Jimmy knows who this guy is.  Ray Garvey, he's from Brooklyn.  He's a tough dude, and he's not easy.  I think he boxed, and he booked a Borgata.  We all know him as comedians, and I didn't deal with him.  I went through Clear Channel, but I used to know Ray as a friend. 
[03:51:00]  I didn't know he was sick, man.  Yeah, yeah.  Bad?  Is he terminally ill?  Yeah, it's stage four.  Get the fuck out of here.  How did I not hear this?  What kind?  A stomach.  Oh, my God.  Ow.  I thought you would have known.  No, man.  Is he a smoker?  No, I don't think so.  It's amazing.  Whenever you hear about someone having cancer, you immediately try to figure out if they're  doing something that you're not doing.  Yeah, I think we automatically want to find a behavior that we're not engaging in that  they do.  Yeah.  Ask Christopher Reeve's wife about that one. 
[03:51:30]  Well, but that's not a...  Non-smoker who gets lung cancer after taking care of her husband for all those years.  Proving there is no God, by the way.  Okay, so stop.  Simon Kenton from Virginia, thank you.  Dolomite from Ottawa, thank you.  Party Cock from Wackbag, thank you.  Blue Heeler from Kentucky, thank you.  Just want to give some acknowledgement today.  Stomach cancer is a motherfucker.  Bill Kaye from Philly, a regular.  Jimbo Plum from North Carolina.  Greg B from Charlotte.  Goober from Wackbag. 
[03:52:00]  Lou T from Jersey.  And Mustang Rob from...  Just fucking romp a room.  Patchogue.  That's all for today.  The final runner-up line of the day?  Yeah.  Okay.  Wow.  Finger of Steve.  It looks like it has chocolate on it.  You know, I didn't hear that line today.  Oh, no?  Any Steve joke?  We're all doing our own thing, trying to get shit for the radio show, so sometimes you 
[03:52:30]  just miss.  Your mind's pumping, trying to find some fucking lines to throw out there.  I know we talk about it a lot, but sometimes I listen to that instant feedback.  Instant replay.  I listen to that instant replay, and I go, wow.  It's the replay.  We're all wrong.  It's like...  Yeah.  It's the replay.  You're saying instant feedback, I'm saying instant replay.  Replay.  The replay, and I go, wow, when did we do this show?  Is this like a year old?  You didn't hear something from today.  You're like, oh, now I remember this.  God, where was I?  SkiColoradoNow.com.  Vinny, thank you from New Brunswick, New Jersey.  Stress Factory. 
[03:53:00]  Here is your line of the day.  Here comes the line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  You did mention the Italian release of Dawn of the Dead, and I do know that, I believe  the pronunciation of his name is Lucio Fulci, if I'm not mistaken.  Yes.  He came out with Zombie 2, which was kind of like...  But the pronunciation of pronunciation is pronunciation, you're told. 
[03:53:30]  And that's how you executive produce.  Oh, it was funny, man.  His daddy was trying to sound so fucking smart.  I didn't want to have to slam him, but everybody was thinking, did he just say pronunciation?  After he pronounced something perfectly?  You had to.  Yeah, he wanted to get the name right.  Because it's so hard to get a foreign name like that right.  So he probably practiced it.  And then pronunciation comes out. 
[03:54:00]  All right, guys.  Just a quick announcement.  Adam was talking about wants to call in some other day.  What's that about?  Do you want to talk to her?  How do you know her?  You guys found her?  Yeah, we went way back.  What?  Adam gave me her number, so if you want to talk to her today or tomorrow.  Tomorrow.  Tomorrow.  We're tired.  So the girl that Adam claimed to have a crush on, but couldn't close the deal?  Yeah.  All right.  She's going to call the show tomorrow and talk to Adam.  All right.  The Adam story continues.  Steve, what's Adam's deal?  Do you know? 
[03:54:30]  Adam seems very self-aware for someone who's got so many character flaws.  Like he might have taken some steps to get them fixed if he was so aware of what they  were by this point.  I have no fucking idea what you just said.  What?  I have no idea what you just said.  That was very clear.  No, it wasn't.  That was you.  You babbled something.  He sounds very self-aware of his own character flaws.  He sounds very self-aware of his own character flaws.  That's for someone who hasn't done anything about them yet.  So you think it's a put-on.  He's calling shenanigans is what he's saying.  Yeah.  All right.  Okay.  You think this is all an act? 
[03:55:00]  Well, if it is an act, you better admit it very soon or we just don't acknowledge  him ever again.  We hate being had like that.  I don't know.  He walked out.  If you watch him walk, he walks like he's maybe a freak.  Yeah, it's too much going on there.  It's like Adam Sandler.  Wow.  Fuck you all.  It's funny.  Tomorrow.  Oh, I love this. 
[03:55:30]  Oh, I love this.  Wow.  She shoved 36 double D's.  She shoved 36 double D's.  Shoving her breasts in everyone's face.  36 double D's.  She shoved 36 double D's.  Oh, wow.  She just looks her now.  She just looks her now.  Anywhere.  With the Mound Wednesday.  Show flash.  Show flash.  Show flash. 
[03:56:00]  Hey, I'm all for it.  Show flash.  And there's boobs in your face.  I'm all for it.  With the Mound Wednesday.  Brett.  Hey.  This is what it's all about.  With the Mound Wednesday.  Oh, oh, oh, I love this.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Oh, wow. 
[03:56:30]  Whip them fuckers out.  This is fantastic.  Wow, wow, wow, wow.  That's why we call it wow.  Talk about the boobies.  Take your bra off and take it off now. 
[03:57:00]  Let's go now.  Wow.  Opie and Andy, 
[03:57:30]  that's what you're listening to.  I'm Andy.  Opie and Andy. </pre>
