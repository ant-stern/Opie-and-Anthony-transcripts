<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with extensive planning for their upcoming "Homeless Shopping Spree," scheduled for the following Tuesday.  This involved discussions about recruiting participants, including Tippy Tom, a gay former Times Square hustler, and "Sperm," who reportedly has AIDS. The hosts highlighted the logistical challenges,  noting the homeless individuals' territoriality and the constant observation by onlookers.  Numerous calls poured in, including one from a liquor donor, another from Riverside Square mall security preparing for their arrival with increased security, and others detailing anecdotes about homeless people and their behaviors, such as restaurant owners poisoning food to deter them from dumpster diving.  The show also touched upon unrelated news items: Geraldo Rivera almost being shot in Afghanistan, the Yankees signing Jason Giambi, and the implications of team loyalty.  A significant portion of the show was devoted to urban legends, including stories about a groom's wedding day infidelity confession, a scuba diver amidst a forest fire, a gay couple injured by a gerbil and lighter fluid, and a toothbrush-related robbery. Video games, specifically Grand Theft Auto 3 and Return to Castle Wolfenstein, were also mentioned, along with the death of Sir Peter Blake, killed by pirates in the Amazon.

Comedian Lewis Black then joined the show.  The conversation initially focused on Black's near-nude appearance on *The Daily Show* that was ultimately cut.  This segued into a lengthy, often vulgar, discussion about Donald Rumsfeld, praising his press handling and stance against the Taliban, contrasted with criticisms of the Clinton administration's foreign policy leading up to 9/11. The conversation was rife with penis jokes and derogatory terms, targeting various government officials. Black shared profane anecdotes from his stand-up routines, including audience heckling. The "homeless shopping spree" was mentioned again, alongside a humorous song about needing new teeth.  A caller discussed Larry Merchant, and the conversation returned to Rumsfeld and the Afghanistan war.  Porn star Terry Weigel, hosting the Porn Awards, was then introduced, sparking further sexually explicit conversations.  A Comedy Central employee, Megan, called requesting contact information for the show's music composer.  After more off-color jokes, Black departed for *The Daily Show*.  Jay Moore, another guest, discussed his stand-up performance and interactions with Jets players, concluding the segment with more personal anecdotes and humor.

The next segment started with a discussion about John Hall, a large football kicker, followed by a humorous audio tribute to a lazy coworker, Earl, who was hospitalized with bleeding ulcers.  A call-in segment followed, before Terry Weigel returned to the studio, along with her husband.  This portion was extremely sexually explicit, featuring descriptions of Weigel's work, body, and simulated sexual acts, including a fake orgasm demonstration and participation in the "Wiffle Ball Bat Challenge." Podiatrists Dr. Jackalone and Dr. Nestor then examined Patty's severely ingrown toenail, a process interspersed with more sexually explicit conversations and tangents about Weigel and a caller with a severe mouth infection. The podiatrists clipped Patty’s toenails on air.  "Sperm," the homeless man, called in to discuss his life and health. The upcoming "homeless shopping spree" was mentioned again.


A later segment focused heavily on Patty's severely overgrown toenails, graphically described by the hosts and a podiatrist (Dr. Jackalone, along with Dr. Nestor and assistant Ed).  The podiatrists used a Dremel tool to remove them on air, with Patty expressing discomfort.  The discussion included speculation about the cause (infection, neglect), and further vulgar commentary.  Potential fungus and a bunion were mentioned, along with the podiatrists' contact information.  Listener "What I learned today" segments followed, featuring unrelated and crude topics.  A call from Chris Kattan, filled with off-color jokes and insults, interrupted. The show concluded with listener calls, Aerosmith CD giveaways, and promotion for the next day’s show, promising to reveal the meaning of "Twato."  A humorous archival bit of a fictional Bob Hope in space was played during a break.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Some days, you know, we're a laugh riot, and other days we just flat out suck, we know it.  Interesting and true.  Hope he earned them for me.  Tippi Tom.  Huh?  Do you know any Christmas songs?  Huh?  Do you know any Christmas songs?  How many what?  Do you know any Christmas songs?  Any sisters?  No, no.  Tippi Tom, listen to me closely.  All right, go ahead, guys.  We got a band?  Do you...  My ears are so good. 
[00:00:30]  Tippi Tom, listen.  Do you know any Christmas songs?  Any twisters?  Butt plug?  This guy is great.  I'm talking about, you talking about twisters?  Tippi Tom, listen to me, okay?  Listen closely.  Here it is.  Do you know any Christmas songs?  Any twisters songs?  The only twister I know that's calling this chubby chuckle. 
[00:01:00]  No!  It's Christmas.  You know, Christmas.  Santa Claus.  Merry Christmas.  Ho, ho, ho.  Santa Claus.  Christmas songs.  Yeah, I know Santa Claus.  He's right down the road.  How much does he get this second?  What are we here?  Santa Claus is right down the road, Anthony.  Yeah, he's right up there.  He's got the suit on and everything, you know?  Of course.  I know Santa Claus.  Do you know any Christmas songs? 
[00:01:30]  Any twisters?  Sing us...  Sing us a Christmas song.  I can't hear you very well.  That's a cigarette, please.  I was thinking he's pumping a cigarette off somebody.  Can I have a hearing aid, please?  Sing us a Christmas song.  Jingle bells.  Boom!  Do you want to hear Jingle bells?  Yeah!  Jingle bells. 
[00:02:00]  Sally Kramer?  My dear, you shall let me call the names.  Then, hey, there, poor Dippy Tom, playing all the reindeer games.  Then, one foggy Christmas Eve, Santa came to say, 
[00:02:30]  Dippy, with your nose so bright, won't you get my sleigh tonight?  And then, oh, you will make it, that you shall never call me names.  Now, the poor Dippy, playing all the reindeer games.  Yeah!  Tippy Tom! 
[00:03:00]  That's right, our brand new friend, Tippy Tom.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show.  Tippy Tom will be part of the homeless shopping spree, Anthony.  The homeless shopping spree, too, happening next Tuesday.  How psyched are you for that?  I can't wait.  Ziggy, and now Tippy Tom, and a whole collection of homeless.  A whole new cast of characters for the homeless shopping spree.  That's great.  Tippy Tom, if you weren't listening yesterday, well, he's a gay gentleman.  Yeah, he used to hustle on the streets back in the old days when, you know, when Times Square was like Sodom and Gomorrah. 
[00:03:30]  You know, when guys and girls were turning tricks out there.  He was one of the guys that would hob a knob for a price on maybe some businessmen that wanted a young man to perform some kind of oral treats on him.  And now he's in his mid to late 40s.  Says he doesn't look quite as good as he used to.  You know, ridden hard and put up wet. 
[00:04:00]  But we're giving him a little bit of sunshine back in his life by involving him in the homeless shopping spree.  He's very excited.  Tippy Tom, he's going to give Ziggy a run for his money.  We're just hoping that we can keep track of Ziggy between now and Tuesday.  That's the problem with the homeless guys.  We have a whole cast of people on the streets of Manhattan just watching the homeless guys.  Yeah.  Because we don't know where to pick them up.  They could disappear.  We have ideas and, you know, we know what corners they pretty much hang out on.  But if we don't have Ziggy or Tippy Tom Tuesday, it's going to mess up the whole homeless shopping spree. 
[00:04:30]  So people are just watching them 24-7 right now.  You know what I learned?  They're very territorial, the homeless.  I used to think they would just get up and walk and, you know, whenever they got tired, they'd go to sleep and they'd get up and keep walking.  They'd pretty much stick to their boundaries.  Like they have their little domain that they consider their home.  And that's why we have people that know where to find them on a regular basis.  People like Ziggy and, of course, the new Tippy Tom.  And we're going to meet some new homeless people today. 
[00:05:00]  Yeah.  Rumor has it one guy that we're meeting today might have the bug.  They call him Sperm.  His name is Sperm.  So don't bow.  That's his street name.  His name is Sperm.  And he may have the bug.  I heard he got his name.  He was arrested.  And he's standing in his jail cell.  And he walked right up to the bars, stuck his head as far through the bars as he could and just went,  Sperm! 
[00:05:30]  And he just kept yelling it over and over again.  So now they call him, hey, you got a nickname like that, Sperm.  Yep.  You're stuck with it for life.  Yeah.  And, yeah, they were saying, hey, I think he's got the bug.  They call it the bug.  Norton.  Isn't that funny?  The AIDS.  But now, hey, I think he's got the bug.  I can't wait to horrify another mall this season.  The bug.  The bug.  You're going to horrify a mall in a lot.  Oh, yeah.  Type people.  Picture a bunch of people just like Ziggy and Tippy Tom and Sperm just going through the mall and trying on clothing. 
[00:06:00]  Maybe going up to the...  Maybe a guy wants to go up and find a scent.  Find a cologne or something.  And he's got to talk to the cologne people.  And, by the way, we encourage the faithful listeners to join us this coming Tuesday.  I recommend kerosene for you.  And a match.  You know, you guys are out there to help us.  Yeah.  So, show up. 
[00:06:30]  A lot of people trying to figure out what mall we're going to this year.  Well, you kind of gave a little clue.  Why?  You said a 40-mile diameter around Midtown Manhattan.  All right.  Could be somewhere in that area, which is really not that good of a clue.  How am I giving that away?  I said it's a little clue.  There's nothing.  It just says it's not Boston.  I will say this, bitch.  Oh, get your pens.  The mall we are going to...  Yeah.  ...is no more... 
[00:07:00]  Yeah.  ...than 25 miles away from where we are right now.  Oh, so now you can rake in that little area.  Mm-hmm.  Now it's 20 miles.  No more than 25.  No more than 25 miles from where we are right now.  Could be we're staying right in Manhattan.  Oh, could be.  Could be we're going to Madison or Fifth Ave.  Uh-huh.  Maybe we're going right back to Short Hills Mall.  Never know.  Or are we going to Westchester Mall?  Are we?  Who knows? 
[00:07:30]  They'll know when the homeless get there.  Oh, yeah.  That's when they're going to be clued in.  We have a bus and everything standing by.  That's the best part.  The ride out is hilarious.  Yeah.  Yeah, we broadcast the whole damn thing.  It's a whole party.  Uh, the bus will be filled with homeless people singing Christmas carols and drinking eggnog.  Stinky homeless.  Smelly homeless.  And then they arrive at the mall and they're announced to the crowd in the parking lot one by one like it's a sports team.  Yeah.  They're given their homeless shopping spree t-shirt.  Uh-huh.  They're given the hundred and whatever dollars and they're set loose. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah, we don't give them the money until they're at the mall because you give them the money early.  They tend to get off the bus when they pass a liquor store and not get back on.  They love the booze, the homeless.  But we'll be supplying some drinks for them on the bus if they want.  A little spirit.  Why not?  We call it spirit this time of year.  You know what?  If you're homeless, uh, you need to, uh, dull the senses a little bit around the holidays.  And I, I recommend booze. 
[00:08:30]  Uh, I'm just getting word from Rick that Snoop called?  Snoop.  Not Snoop Doggy Dogg.  Snoop the homeless guy.  Snoop the homeless guy.  Yeah.  He was part of the last homeless shopping spree and he wants to join us again this year?  He actually called me on my phone this morning.  He had, he said, I heard on the street.  Words on the street?  Nice.  I like that.  He said that, uh, that, that, that guy from, from wherever, you know, the Keith was looking  for more homeless people.  Uh-huh.  And he goes, and I, I was with you guys a couple of years ago. 
[00:09:00]  I was hoping to get on board again.  Get on the bus.  He was nervous.  He thought it was today.  He didn't want to miss out.  Oh.  So you told him he's in, right?  Yeah.  Uh, before his, uh, quarter ran out, I got a, uh, contact number for his mom that he  can go get a message from, uh, Keith.  Why does mom take him in?  We got to ask him things like that.  Like, that's what I want to ask him.  What did you do that your mom...  People don't want to be taken in.  They love living on the street.  They love the street.  Not all of them, obviously, but there's a, there's a, there's a percentage.  Remember when Giuliani tried to round him up a few years ago and put him in mental  hospitals and they all went crazy? 
[00:09:30]  He said, no, I don't want a warm bed and a place to live.  I live on the street.  This is what I do.  So crazy.  It's so funny that the word is out on the street.  Word out on the street.  Homeless people know how to communicate, though.  They know the network.  They know where all the free food is every day.  They know this stuff.  They know where the packed dumpsters are, where they could maybe get those, uh, stale  Dunkin' Donuts, the lettuce behind the supermarkets, the little brown around the  edges.  What's the matter, Norton?  That's just awful.  You don't like the way that's how, that's survival in the jungle of New York. 
[00:10:00]  You know what some of the restaurant owners in Manhattan do, though?  What?  Because they don't want the homeless eating out of their dumpsters.  What?  They poison the food.  Get out of here.  You haven't read this stuff in the paper?  I don't think they would destroy it, make it inedible.  They make it, poison it.  They, they, they have, they have means to make sure that, uh, they stay away from their  dumpsters.  Swear to God.  You know what?  Because who the hell wants to go out to your dumpster and find a dead homeless guy in there  one day?  You know?  Took a header in the dumpster.  Drown in a bucket of olive oil or something. 
[00:10:30]  Ugh.  You should just give it to him, let him eat it.  If you're going to throw it out, give it to a guy, let him eat it.  That's what they do.  They go around, they make the rounds, like a restaurant.  Hey, could I have reservations at that dumpster tonight?  You know, how was the dumpster at, uh, this, uh, restaurant?  Oh, I highly recommend it.  Very good.  I couldn't get a table there, though, the other night.  I had to go down the street to the crappy place.  Are you trying to say they have a Zagat's for homeless people?  I think there is some kind of a, yeah.  There's like a Zagat's restaurant guy?  That's a four-star dumpster.  You know?  And they probably are.  But the service sucks. 
[00:11:00]  Any level of life you're at, there are similarities.  And I would guarantee that if you're homeless, there are places that are better dumpsters than  other dumpsters.  Where they're like, no, that's the good stuff.  They throw that away maybe a little sooner than that crap place.  That's like the fast food place, you know?  Is there like a velvet rope and rave music going on inside?  Yeah, hard to get into.  It's probably hard to get.  You got to get there early, probably.  Is it time?  You got to make sure you're there? 
[00:11:30]  Yeah.  It's all territorial, Ben.  Yeah, that's what we're talking about.  They stake out their areas.  Oh, they get pissed if homeless people are from another side of town, uh, you know.  They duke it out?  Oh, yeah.  They're like little gangs and stuff, too.  That's great.  They're vicious.  They only use that energy to maybe work and get a home.  Mike, what's going on?  You're on the O.P. and Anthony show.  How are you guys doing?  Hey.  Listen, uh, I heard about the homeless shopping spree, and, uh, I'd like to maybe donate  a little liquor for the, uh, trip over there.  No, I think we're set with that.  Oh, are you guys?  Yeah, a lot of people want to help us with the homeless shopping spree. 
[00:12:00]  It's a really good thing that you guys do.  Don't you do?  Hold on.  Don't you do if you want to help us with this?  Just show up at the mall that, uh, we announced.  Really?  Yeah, we had people buying, uh, some of the homeless guys' jackets and stuff.  We give them, uh, $100 to go in there and shop with, but, uh, other people are  buying them stuff.  Someone bought Ziggy some sneakers.  Yeah, felt good about it.  Well, we also need, uh, a bunch of people to help us, because some of, some of the shop  owners, they start pulling down their grates and stuff, and that's when you guys start  cheering, you know, let the homeless shop.  With our big number one fingers. 
[00:12:30]  Do we have that, uh, that sound bite from last time?  Uh, I think Stinky was working on that.  A couple hundred people just, uh, chanting, let the homeless shop.  Right.  Let the homeless shop.  And then the guy had to, uh, lift up the grade and let, uh, the whole gang into his  store, so.  Can I say this, guys?  Uh, it really, uh, it's a really nice thing that you guys are doing.  Uh, who actually came up with this idea?  Uh, I don't know.  Oh, here, here we go.  Hold on, hold on.  Wait, wait.  We'll give you the big intro.  Mike?  Yes.  Go ahead.  Who came up with the idea?  I'm just wondering. 
[00:13:00]  Oh, no, you have the answer.  Okay.  Homeless bit.  Uh-huh.  The homeless bit?  The homeless bit helping homeless people out.  What is that?  So, so, so that's the same thing.  You know what?  Douchebag, it's completely different.  Douchebag?  That's good.  The idea is completely different.  Right.  Mike?  Look, you're doing...  Mike trying to cause trouble.  It's completely different, you douchebag.  There he goes.  If you do the same exact bit, it's like a band that just covers songs.  Yeah.  Figure it out. 
[00:13:30]  Don't sing about love.  Another band sang about love.  So, let me, let me, uh, let me, uh, see if this, I got this right.  If you take a homeless guy, one guy, right, and you, uh, buy him a suit, and you, uh, uh,  send him out on a job interview and see how he does, that's exactly the same, and you  would be ripping off that idea if you took a bunch of homeless people, put them on a bus,  sent them to a mall to go shopping for the holidays.  Hmm.  Yeah.  Of course, yeah.  Right?  Well, okay. 
[00:14:00]  All right.  Okay.  Douchebag.  In Mike's mind.  Douchebag.  Douchebag.  You can't rain on our parade, Mike.  Jerry, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  I, I work in a mall in Jersey.  Yeah.  And, uh, I mean, in my opinion, I feel like this is, this is where you guys are going  to be, but we had a meeting today, and in the security meeting, they have, uh, your name  got brought up, and we have, uh, the mall, can I say the name of the mall?  Yeah, I don't care. 
[00:14:30]  Riverside Square in Hackensack.  Oh, oh, Riverside Square in Hackensack.  Oh, yeah.  All right, all right.  And what did they say?  What did they say in the meeting?  Okay, there's six exterior exits to the mall.  Right.  Okay, not including restaurants.  Right.  They assigned two, uh, rent-a-cops.  Yeah.  To each exit.  Okay?  And if, and if, if you guys are coming here and you guys penetrate the exit, then the security 
[00:15:00]  cop is fired on the spot.  Well, uh, how did they justify not letting people come in to shop in their mall?  They, they feel like it will be putting the patrons at risk.  It's not illegal, uh, to have homeless people shop at a mall.  Do you know, do you, go back to them and, uh, say, don't you think it'll be really bad  press if, uh, the news picks up on the fact that this mall did not let homeless people  who want an opportunity to maybe buy some warm clothes and, and, and whatnot, uh, the opportunity  to come in and shop for the, for the holidays. 
[00:15:30]  Wouldn't you think the mall would get some really bad press for that?  They're treating it like the Hamas is coming to town.  Well, that's our next thing, Hamas Easter, where we, uh, no, well, we'll, we'll have  to wait and see if we're coming to have a lovely mall.  All right, guys, I hope, I hope this is it.  We might have to change our plans now that I just heard that.  Thank you, Jerry.  All right.  All right.  Bye.  Yeah, the mall's gearing up.  Freddie, what's going on?  Hey, how you doing?  Listen, I used to work for a city agency.  I'm not going to mention it because hopefully I'm going to go back. 
[00:16:00]  Okay.  But, uh, I used to work in the kitchen area, and at the end of the day, so the homeless  people couldn't get the food, they would drench it in bleach.  Yeah, that's what it was.  Oh, bleach.  Yeah, it makes it in that.  So, yeah, so the homeless people know, oh, damn.  Yeah, I used to deal with a lot of homeless people in the city, and this guy asked me  for liquor or food one day.  I didn't have enough money to give him any food, but, uh, he liked to get high, so I gave  him a hit of acid.  Ah, there you go.  Well, look at you.  Thank you, Freddie.  All right, later.  All right, peace.  Yeah, that's what it is.  They pour bleach on the food in their dumpsters to keep the homeless away. 
[00:16:30]  Stosh, what's up?  Hey, guys, what's up?  Hey.  Uh, if you happen to know the dumpster owner's name, do you get a free glass of wine?  One for New York.  Very good, Stosh.  Later.  All right, bye.  Oh, my God, did you read this news story about Geraldo?  You know, our favorite war correspondent, Geraldo Rivera?  Yeah.  For, um, for Fox News.  Opie, he ducked to avoid sniper fire that came so close to Geraldo, it was picked up 
[00:17:00]  by the crew's microphone.  Almost shot.  The sniper almost got Geraldo.  How do you duck in time?  I know.  He's got some quick reflexes, huh?  First of all, uh, people that have been in wars will tell you that the person that gets  hit by a sniper's bullet, you don't hear it because the sound hasn't gotten to you yet.  And, uh, he, he said, uh, he didn't return fire.  Oh, my God.  Because, you know, Geraldo, you know, Geraldo is packing heat. 
[00:17:30]  Uh, and he has suggested that if he got the opportunity, uh, he would try to kill Osama  bin Laden if he ever met him face to face.  You know, like if he saw him, he'd pull out his sidearm and, you know, he, I'm Geraldo and  you're dead.  I did it.  You know, I believe, uh, Geraldo's doing the right thing, but he's no John Wayne.  Relax.  Dude, he's got the cowboy hat on and he's got a gun.  And now he's saying that, uh, he, uh, almost got shot the other day.  I heard he's got...  Live on TV.  I heard he's got another special coming up. 
[00:18:00]  He's going to, uh, hunt, uh, Osama bin Laden.  Yeah.  And when the big moment happens, he's going to end up in an empty cave.  Right.  In an empty, uh, cave with just, uh, an old liquor bottle to pick up.  Remember that?  Excuse me, people, can we all remember Geraldo Rivera's, the guy that opened up Al Capone's  vault and found nothing, beer bottle?  And, uh, he also did some other, uh, sensational, uh, show like that, didn't he?  Where he opened something else up.  Then he opened up his head with the Nazi, uh, uh, KKK black shows he used to do. 
[00:18:30]  This is the same guy.  He was doing very well on, uh, CNBC.  And he left because this gives him more press.  He doesn't care about news or, uh, um, he just wants to be in the news.  He doesn't care about broadcasting it.  So now he's in there getting shot at, which is just great.  Well, maybe next time.  If he was the target of that sniper guy, yeah, he'd be dead. 
[00:19:00]  He'd be dead.  It's probably just some ricochet.  They wanted to kill Geraldo.  I'll return fire.  I'm pinned down.  I'm Geraldo Rivera.  Pinned down here in Afghanistan.  Are we off the air?  Okay, turn the sound effects machine off.  All right, well, we're just getting started.  I guess I have to announce this for all you, uh, Yankee fans.  Um, yes.  Uh, Yankees got, uh, Yankees, uh, oh gosh. 
[00:19:30]  Oh my God, I'm going to pass out.  Uh, oh my God.  Uh, uh, Yankees.  How you doing?  Jason Giambi agrees to leave the A's for the Yankees.  Yes.  I don't want them.  Giambi.  Giambi has agreed to a seven-year, 128 million dollar contract with the Yankees.  How you doing?  Oh God.  Wow.  Oh God.  How you doing? 
[00:20:00]  Yankees.  How you doing?  Do you guys have any pride whatsoever?  Hey.  Pride in winning.  Just buying World Series rings.  Pride in winning.  Who are the Mets getting?  I don't know who we're getting.  Better be Moises.  How you doing?  Eh, eh.  How you doing?  How you doing?  Yankees.  How you doing?  Why?  Eh.  How you doing?  Yankees.  How you doing?  Oh, okay.  Look, I'm a huge fan.  I can't take this anymore. 
[00:20:30]  How you doing?  Stop it.  Turn it off.  Turn it off.  How you doing?  Turn it off.  How you doing?  How you doing?  I don't get it.  Thank you, Geraldo.  I just shot Johnny Balls or Joey Balls.  Yeah, Jason Guiambi will be Yankee for the next seven years.  All right.  Make a look ahead, make a honey-o, Guiambi.  What is his name?  Guiambi.  Whatever.  Guiambi.  I don't love him.  Is that what you're calling him?  I don't care.  Why did they let Tino Martinez go? 
[00:21:00]  He had, what was it, four fewer homers and seven fewer RBIs,  and they could have got him for three years for $21 million,  and he'd been a great Yankee.  Have some loyalty.  The guy was great.  Wow.  That really bugs me that they let him go and picked up Guiambi.  Loyalty in today's sports world.  Really annoys me.  You do make a good point.  No, I wanted Tino.  Tino is a great Yankee.  All right.  Well, congratulations on winning the World Series in 2002.  No.  Jesus.  It's pitching, not hitting. 
[00:21:30]  Yeah.  Ed, what's going on?  What's up, man?  I'm waiting to talk to him about the mall.  Yeah, you're right.  Yeah, on the air, man.  Hey, hey, what's up, man?  Hey, Norton, this is Ed from the other day talking about Ozzy and Sabbath.  Oh, hey, what's up, man?  What's up?  Hey, how great is it, man?  These malls are shaking, man.  They're already having security meetings about you guys.  I think it's hilarious.  Yeah, I love it.  Dude, it is great, man.  That's why we came up with this homeless shopping spree idea. 
[00:22:00]  A lot of uptight people out there.  Hey, I think it's a great thing, man.  When you guys announced it the other day,  the churches were filled with people running malls begging for it not to beat Earth.  All right.  You know what I mean?  Hi, man.  We'll have to wait and see what mall it is.  Oh, dude, I'm waiting.  I'll be listening.  I'll tell you, at this point, it's down to three malls.  Oh, yeah?  We're not even going to make the official decision until, I think, Tuesday morning.  Yeah.  Because we want to throw people off.  Our primary and secondary targets.  All right, Ed, thank you. 
[00:22:30]  All right, have a good one.  Bye.  Because everyone thinks they have an idea of where we're going.  Yeah.  We haven't made up our minds yet.  It is down to three, though.  Three really good ones.  And we've got to take our first break, okay?  Lewis Black coming in today?  Yep.  Yes.  We can talk a little bit about the war with Lewis.  That always goes so well.  And also, Anthony, who else is coming in?  Oh, Terry Weigel?  Yeah, Weigel.  Weigel, Weigel, Giambi, Gambi.  I don't give a flying F.  She's a porn star.  Right. 
[00:23:00]  And she hosts the Porn War.  She's coming in.  And maybe, hopefully, a mellower Jay Moore today.  And Patty's feet get done today.  Patty's?  Oh, Jesus.  She's getting a pedicure?  Pedicure and the doctor's coming in.  Look at all the show prep we did today.  Nice.  We're ready to go.  All right, Ed?  Yeah, rock.  All right.  Also, when we get back, I think we need to talk about what the hell is that a little bit more, too.  Yes.  What's wrong, Ben?  I just restart my computer.  Oh, okay.  F'd up.  So, we'll talk about what the hell is that, which happens tomorrow on the show. 
[00:23:30]  Opie, you guys are done.  And Anthony.  Wait two minutes.  We'll say something really dumb.  Let's bring in the incest couch.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Gak, gak, gak.  You couldn't hear the gak, gak, gak, gak, because you were playing that one sound effect.  The Vulcan can.  Holy, yes.  This thing's amazing.  And what's the ready, fire, aim thing?  Rumsfeld.  Rumsfeld.  Talking about the old ways of the Pentagon. 
[00:24:00]  By the way.  Ready, fire, aim.  A couple phone numbers for you in the New York area.  877-692-1027.  Anywhere else, 866-277-4WOW.  That number again, 866-277-4WOW.  A couple of instant feedbacks coming in really fast, Anthony.  Yeah.  Corey from The Wood.  Hey, Tino.  Thanks for five years.  Here's a New York Monopoly game.  See ya.  Oh.  That bugs you, right, Norm?  So, at 128 million. 
[00:24:30]  We didn't lose because of hitting.  So stupid.  We lost because one of the reasons we didn't have a setup, man, when they let Nelson go,  so Rivera was a bit overworked, and I love Rivera.  I'm not faulting him.  But, you know, look at it.  Hitting never wins your championships.  How many did the Rangers win with all their great hitting?  Ooh.  Yvonne Rodriguez, Juan Gonzalez, Rusty Greer, all those great hitters.  They had how many championships?  None.  I learned something today. 
[00:25:00]  Yeah.  You're actually a baseball fan.  They really annoy me.  He knows his crap.  Rafael Palmeiro, they had a great team, the Rangers.  Great hitting, and they won nothing.  And what's this we?  You're not part of the team.  Yes, I am.  Yes, I am.  It's the collective fan we.  I get crap when I say I'm part of the Islanders, when I say we will win, we will do this, we, we, we.  Well, I say we.  You we?  Exactly.  You we.  I we, you we.  Dan from Hoboken, Giambi, Giambi. 
[00:25:30]  Giambi.  Giambi wins two MVPs, and Norton wants Tino?  Yes.  Is he going to pass up headlining with Chris Rock to open for Jeff Norris?  Yeah, and Jeff Norris, dude, you got it.  And Giambi won a lot of championships, too, with his great MVP numbers and all the other solid hitters on the A's.  Nothing.  Dan should have used Voss.  Voss, always funny.  You know, I was going to rewrite Dan's joke, but I thought he was pissed off at me, so I went with it.  I swear to God, I was thinking the same thing.  The Voss was, of course.  The Voss was the name there.  I know the struggle. 
[00:26:00]  Anthony from West Orange, you guys should send another bus to a mall as a decoy.  A decoy bus.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  That's not a bad idea.  Yeah, you never know.  You never know what we're going to do.  We will pull off Homeless Shopping Spree 2, trust me.  Chris, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on, O&A?  Hey.  Hey, Opa, you played GTA 3 yet, man?  Not yet.  I still got to get through the last section of Silent Hill 2, and then this weekend I'm doing Grand Theft Auto 3 without a doubt.  You've hated Silent Hill 2. 
[00:26:30]  I didn't hate it, but I was just disappointed.  I thought it could have been better.  If I don't like a game, boof.  No, it wasn't.  This thing gets tossed.  Opa, I'm going to save you the trouble, man.  The payoff is not worth it.  Just get right into GTA 3, man.  I got like maybe an hour left on Silent Hill 2, top seven.  I also wanted to recommend a couple of other games.  Yeah.  If you're into like the Silent Hill 2 type of games, try Devil May Cry.  That game kicks so much more ass, man.  And also Metal Gear Solid 2.  Yeah.  That's a really good one, too. 
[00:27:00]  Yeah.  That's getting some rave reviews.  I want to thank the fine folks at Acclaim.  They just marched down to our office and gave us a stack of great games that we're going to check out.  That's cool.  Crazy Taxi, or are they just calling it a taxi these days?  It's Crazy Taxi.  Oh, they're calling it Crazy Taxi?  I like it.  All right.  Grand Theft Auto looks like a great game.  I haven't cracked that one open yet.  But you've got to check the next game that they're coming out with, too, the Rockstar games.  They're just going all out. 
[00:27:30]  The next game is just you're in the middle of a riot, and the most stuff you can lose is, you know, that's how you win the game.  You know, they've taken this whole fantasy thing to the next level.  A lot of people can't involve themselves in things like riots and just bloodshed on the street.  Through these games, you can.  We've got a great relationship with Rockstar as well.  They've been sending us some good games over the years.  All right, Chris.  Thank you.  All right.  No problem.  Back to the top.  I look forward to Grand Theft Auto 3.  And for you PC people, Castle Wolfenstein.  Return to Castle Wolfenstein. 
[00:28:00]  Unbelievable.  I was playing in the back office.  Our own Ken Stevens.  He's now called Super GM.  Super GM Ken Stevens.  Yes.  Walks in, and I'm dismantling Nazi soldiers with this machine gun that I have.  And he's laughing.  He's laughing.  He's asking me questions.  How long does it take to learn how to play that?  I'm like, ah, it's no time.  You know, you just kind of get into it.  It's like, yeah.  So he goes, ah, kill one more person.  He's like, he had something to do, but he wanted me to kill another Nazi. 
[00:28:30]  He wanted to kill one more person.  So I was looking around.  I couldn't find another Nazi.  I found one way across the other end of the castle.  I couldn't use my machine gun.  So I pull out the sniper rifle.  I go into scope mode, and he goes, oh.  Like, he liked it.  And then I crack the Nazi in the head, and his little German helmet goes flying off.  And there's Ken.  Oh, that's great.  He likes it.  He loves watching Nazis getting killed. 
[00:29:00]  I love that game.  No political correctness.  Nothing.  You know, you're killing Nazis.  So the swastikas are there, the Nazi flags, the SS uniforms, the pictures of Hitler.  It's great.  And you go around, and you kill them.  It's wonderful.  And then there's a whole zombie undead sub-story.  Like a little Resident Evil type of thing.  Yeah, yeah, like the Nazis are working on this super soldier thing, where I saw this half  a corpse.  It walked on its feet. 
[00:29:30]  It had no lower section, and it had this apparatus around it that had this electrical  stuff coming out of it.  And you'd hear it going, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick.  And you wouldn't know where it's coming from.  And you turn the corner, and there he is.  Dick, dick, dick, dick, dick, starts chasing you, walking on his feet.  I mean, on his hands, like feet, carrying this electronic device.  It's a great game, though.  Check it out.  The monsters in Silent Hill 2 stink.  Are you not, Gary?  No, the monsters, they look like washing machines.  Washing machines.  They look like old-fashioned washing machines. 
[00:30:00]  Want to buy a dryer door?  I was just setting you up for your rich boss line.  You know that, right?  I love that boss line.  Hey, Mark from Cleveland, what's going on today?  How are you doing?  Pretty good.  Hey, does anybody there know who Peter Blake is?  Sir Peter Blake, my friend.  Why don't you tell everyone who Peter Blake is?  We do have the story in front of us here.  You do have it?  Yeah, go ahead.  I just figured it would fit right in, and I wanted to be the first to say that.  I think it's just standing.  People can still have that happen.  You know, okay. 
[00:30:30]  You know, we talk about the unlucky lottery on the Opie and Anthony show.  Do you think this might fit in?  I do believe if you're killed by a pirate, you qualify for the unlucky lottery.  I don't know.  Here's the story right off the AP from Paris.  Sir Peter Blake, who headed the New Zealand syndicate that won the America's Cup in 95 and 2000,  has been killed by pirates.  In the Amazon.  In the Amazon.  His race sponsor said Thursday.  Arr, matey.  Arr, matey.  You got killed by pirates.  Where's ye rum? 
[00:31:00]  Where's ye rum?  No, I don't have rum.  I, you know, America's Cup.  Arr, winner.  Where's ye gold doubloons?  No, I don't have any.  I'm a yacht racer.  We still have pirates?  Walk the plank.  It sucks that I died, but I'm more...  You both don't have a plank.  I'm more shocked that there are pirates still out there.  There are pirates in the Amazon.  Pirates?  Who knew?  They got the skull and crossbones flags and stuff?  Did they hit them broadside with the cannons? 
[00:31:30]  Like, how do you get this guy?  This guy, uh...  And how do they kill him?  Do they make him walk the plank?  Walk the plank.  Arr.  They're wearing their striped red and white shirts.  Parrot on the shoulder.  The patch on the eye.  Arr.  Got those pistols with the big flintlocks on them.  One guy's got a hook for the hand and the peg leg.  Arr, matey.  Matey.  How do you get this guy?  A pirate?  And was Peter Pan involved?  I'm trying to see. 
[00:32:00]  There's really no details on the killing.  All right.  Thanks for that, Mark.  Take care.  Tragic story, bud.  Pirates.  Pirates got them.  Yo-ho, yo-ho.  A pirate's life for me.  I bet that ruins it for the family.  I think I'm going to be able to go on Pirates of the Caribbean.  Oh, I remember Peter.  I think more people were killed in Pirates of the Caribbean than by real pirates.  You know?  They had a couple accidents in that ride. 
[00:32:30]  At least in the last 10, 20 years.  Yeah.  It's like, oh, my God.  Killed by a pirate.  Ken, what's going on?  What's up, buddy?  Hey.  Norton, what's going on, man?  You're the best.  Thank you, sir.  I got the ultimate unlucky lottery.  All right.  All right.  It happened a couple years ago out west.  They had the big forest fires.  I think it was either Colorado or California.  I'm not quite sure which one it was.  Yeah.  But after the fire went out, the investigators were going through.  And in the middle of the forest, they see this guy who's pretty much charred, but he's 
[00:33:00]  got his scuba gear on.  No.  Scuba gear on?  Stop.  Wait.  So he was charred, but he had his scuba gear on?  Why would...  How the hell did he get in the middle of the woods dressed like that?  Why would a guy be in a scuba gear in the middle of a burnt-out forest?  Right.  At west, they used airplanes and helicopters to scoop up water.  Right.  Oh, no.  Wait a minute.  I think I know where he's going with this, Hopi.  The airplane came down, scooped them up, and pretty much just let them go over the forest. 
[00:33:30]  Oh, my God.  That was burning at the time.  Well, they scooped them up.  So when they did the autopsy, when they did the autopsy, they determined that he didn't  die from being scooped up.  He died from the fall.  So he was alive when he fell.  Oh, he was alive when he fell.  So he wasn't burnt by the forest fire because it wasn't a burnt mark.  Wow.  Hey, Ken, what paper did you read this in?  No, this was in one of the magazines.  I'm a firefighter in New Jersey.  We read magazines.  It was in one of the magazines a couple of years ago. 
[00:34:00]  Yeah.  Ken, are you looking forward to Santa Claus's visit this year?  I am.  I am.  Hey, Ken, I got a story for you.  And I know about this one because it happened to a friend's cousin that told me about this.  The wedding, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Guy getting married, right?  And this is a guy that I knew.  I talked to him.  He was at the wedding, at this wedding.  And they're at the reception, and they're sitting down, and the groom told everyone to 
[00:34:30]  turn their plates over.  He said, this marriage is over.  And on the bottom was a picture of the bride and the best man having sex.  Oh, I've heard that.  No, you didn't.  I heard that.  How did you hear that?  I heard it.  It was on the Internet or something like that.  Stop.  Are you saying that's like an urban legend or something?  And everything on the Internet is true, right, Ken?  Absolutely.  All right.  All right.  Did you hear about the one where the woman put peanut butter on her?  Oh, yeah.  I need to stop you about the wedding thing.  Know why that is not true, Anthony?  Why?  He actually went through the ceremony of getting married. 
[00:35:00]  Now he's effed.  He's at the reception.  Now he's effed with lawyers for the last six years as she tries to take every stinking  penny from him.  That doesn't happen in real life.  Son of a bitch.  And you know what?  That scuba guy, by the way, did not die from the fall because I read that.  He was killed because he got shot flashing his high beams at a car that was coming with  a lot of stuff.  Oh, that's right.  That's the gang thing.  Don't mess with that stuff, Norton.  Ken, can I help you out here?  Yes.  Please, please don't go around telling that story like it's real. 
[00:35:30]  You're embarrassing.  It is.  It's true.  No, no, Ken, Ken.  You're embarrassing yourself.  Ken, simmer down here a second and open up your mind for just a moment.  This story has circulated for quite a while now on the internet.  It's called an urban legend.  You ever hear of urban legends?  I thought it was the voice in my head telling me.  The woman that goes down to Mexico and she's on a boat and she sees a dog swimming in the  water and she's like, oh, my God.  And picks it up.  It's supposed to be, you know.  And takes it to the vet and the vet goes, oh, my God, it's a giant Mexican sewer rat. 
[00:36:00]  Yeah.  Same thing.  Thank you, Ken.  Thank you.  All right.  We're going to take it from here.  Thank you.  Anthony, my favorite one, though, we haven't talked about in a while.  Yeah.  And it was reported by the L.A. Times.  Oh.  Remember that one?  Oh, yeah.  Where the two guys went to the ER.  One, his face was burnt really, really bad.  Yeah.  And the other guy, his balloon knot back door area was burnt really, really bad.  You see, what happened was. 
[00:36:30]  And the guy had a broken nose.  The other guy had a broken nose.  Besides having the burnt face, he had a broken nose.  Norton, you see what happened was they were a lovely gay couple.  Uh-huh.  And they were doing things with gerbils.  Gerbils.  And one of the gerbils got lost, let's say.  Uh-huh.  And the one guy bent down with a lighter to try to find the gerbil.  Using that as a light device, he tried to find the gerbil so he could pull them out by his little gerbily tail.  And at that point.  Talk slower.  Talk slower. 
[00:37:00]  Some gas was involved.  Gas.  Man, we are doing a really good job.  And if they jump out down the hall, someone's going to have to pay with their life.  Gas that was behind the gerbil.  Uh, ignited.  Firing the flaming gerbil out into the guy's face.  Breaking his nose and burning him.  And just the flames burnt the guy's, um, uh, back door area.  And some of his organs.  Right.  And, um, they, uh, uh, were in the news for that.  And the doctor gave a press conference on their condition and how it happened. 
[00:37:30]  And people to this day send us that story.  And swear it's true.  Like it's real.  Like it's real.  All right.  Yeah, here's that urban legend right there.  Well, on an urban legend page.  The firefighter.  Uh, the, uh, the scuba diver in the fire.  Right.  Yeah.  Give me a break.  And people tell me it's like they're real.  Lee, what's going on?  Uh, yeah.  I just, um, I went to the Merchant Marine Academy and I had a teacher that got her teeth kicked in by pirates. 
[00:38:00]  And apparently they're, they're all over the South China Seas these days.  I'll kick your teeth in, matey.  R.  I remember the first Survivor.  R.  It came out.  I think Jeff Probst told us on the air.  Yeah.  Oh, or, uh, or, uh, Mark Burnett.  Um, and, uh, they had a deal with pirates for that first taping.  Pirates?  Are they real?  Like, what is a modern day pirate like?  You know, you think of old, uh, uh, sailors.  And, um, uh, you know, nowadays they're still sailors, but they're different. 
[00:38:30]  They got upgraded, uh, boats and, and equipment.  But a pirate, you still think of as that, arr, you know, 1700s with a big blouse.  Like, buy a bottle of Captain Morgan rum and look at that guy.  That's a pirate with a big bloused up shirt.  What does a modern day pirate look like?  Scrimshaw.  Scrimshaw.  Scrimshaw.  I'm going to carve into this ivory tooth.  Arr, matey, a whale's tooth. 
[00:39:00]  I thought Scrimshaw.  I thought the blooms was out there, but...  Go, the blooms.  Arr.  Wow.  Hey, Chris, you're next to the Opie and Anthony show.  Hey, guys.  What's happening?  Hey.  Hey, I want to tell a story.  I went away on vacation a couple weeks ago.  Me and my girlfriend, we get back and we're getting the pictures developed.  And all of a sudden, I see these pictures of my toothbrush.  And somebody's rubbing them, cleaning their crotch with them.  And it looks like the cleaning people.  I couldn't believe it.  They used my toothbrush.  Remember that story?  This is...  There's another part of that legend. 
[00:39:30]  Finky rule.  It's a little different.  Well, they were robbed, right?  Yeah, it was a guy in a hotel room, a guy and his girl on vacation.  They got robbed of everything except the camera.  Except the camera and the toothbrush.  And a toothbrush.  And they went home.  And they're using their toothbrush and whatnot.  They send out their film to be developed, thanking God that that wasn't taken.  At least they'll have their memories.  And as they went through the pictures, one of the last pictures on the roll was two of  the guys that robbed them with the toothbrushes firmly planted in their balloon knots. 
[00:40:00]  So by the time they saw the picture, it was too late.  They had been using their toothbrushes.  Even though that's an urban legend as well, I guarantee people have done that trick.  Yeah, it sounds like a great trick to do.  How many people have taken someone's camera and taken a shot of their unit?  Their unit.  Oh, yeah.  A strange twist of that story, though, Opie, the people that robbed it.  We're pirates, I hear.  They were pirates.  Arr, I got that toothbrush right to the arr.  Arr. 
[00:40:30]  Danielle, what's up?  Hi, I was calling regarding that homeless person contest that you guys are having.  Well, we like to call it the homeless shopping spree.  It's not a contest.  Everyone's a winner.  It's not a contest.  It is a charitable event.  Although I definitely agree, homeless people should be able to shop wherever they want.  And also, you know, in the past, it may have been hysterical and a lot of fun.  This year, stores are having a really hard time, as is, getting customers in and just bringing a whole bunch of smelly people by. 
[00:41:00]  It's probably going to deter a lot of people shopping.  You know, it's all people like you, you elitist bitch.  You don't think that the homeless should be given the opportunity to enjoy shopping during the holiday season?  Oh, I do, but if it's going to be for all those people from shopping, then I don't think that it's not worth it.  Let me clear you into something, okay?  The mall is going to get a lot of business, because know what ends up happening?  About 1,000 to 2,000 of our listeners show up.  And guess what? 
[00:41:30]  A bunch of those people end up spending a lot of money in the mall that day.  Well, I hope so.  Thanks for the call.  You're welcome.  And if it deters someone from shopping, because it's homeless people shopping,  then as they get into their elitist cars and drive home, they should be killed by a drunk driver.  Oh, God.  Jesus.  Run over the homeless if you feel so badly about it as you're driving home.  Hey, Eddie, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Talking to you.  Yeah.  Sorry, man.  Listen, I don't want to bring the show down at all, but I was wondering if I could mention a memorial service this Saturday for my firefighter friend. 
[00:42:00]  We're always good for plugging the memorial services here.  All right.  Cool.  Thanks.  It's Saturday at 1 o'clock at the Church of the Resurrection.  It's for Officer, not Officer, Firefighter Christopher Pickford.  A lot of his friends know him as Super Chris.  And, you know, he was killed in the disaster.  Had a building fall on him.  Jesus.  Where's that church?  What bar is that in?  It's in Queens in Kew Gardens.  It's on 84th Avenue and 118th Street. 
[00:42:30]  It's at 1 o'clock.  And then afterwards, the good firefighters have rented Doral's Restaurant on Myrtle Avenue on 82nd Street for some cocktails afterwards.  There you go.  Firefighters always know how to wrap up the memorial services, man.  They certainly do.  They've been very good to the family as well.  How's the family doing?  They're doing really good, actually.  Yeah.  And like I said, they're being taken care of real well.  Cool.  Very good, man.  All right, but thanks.  I've got to go return some videotapes now.  All right, Eddie.  Thanks.  You know what I was...  Hurricane cycle, right?  Yeah, that's great. 
[00:43:00]  He's going back with that line.  Good boy.  You know what's great?  I used to do the air conditioning and heating installation.  We did a couple of firehouses out on Long Island.  These guys got bars in those firehouses that rival a lot of your local hangout bars.  Shut up.  You're going to ruin it.  No, it's not ruining it.  It's a known thing.  It's a known thing.  It's just where they blow up steam and relax and stuff.  And I got no work done.  I would get there.  I would unload some tools.  I'd make like I was working for an hour. 
[00:43:30]  And the rest of the time, it was hanging out with the firefighters, watching huge TV, and sitting at a bar, on a bar stool, hanging out.  At the firehouse?  Yeah.  The bar is right at the firehouse.  It's right at the firehouse.  And it was...  I wish I could remember where it was.  It was somewhere in North Shore, Long Island.  And we would just sit there and drink beer all day.  They had the taps, they got the bottled beer, they got booze, big TV, couches.  It was great.  You know?  These guys know how to blow off steam, I'll tell you that. 
[00:44:00]  Cool.  Let's go to Denny.  Denny, you're next on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  What's going on, O.N.A.?  Hey.  Hey, yesterday, you guys were talking about mixing Vizic Man and Stone Cold and making it sound like they're having gay sex.  Oh, yeah.  We got to get more clips.  You ain't got it yet?  We need a few more clips before we can make it happen.  Oh, okay.  By the way, I want to thank the WWF.  They gave us a little sneak peek of what's going to happen tonight.  Because Vince McMahon is supposed to kiss the rock's butt. 
[00:44:30]  The faces that Vince makes tonight are hilarious.  Oh, yeah?  They only gave us, like, about two minutes, so we don't know what ended up happening.  But they gave us the setup, and the faces that Vince makes, oh, my God, you're going to puke.  You're going to laugh.  So, all right, Denny, thank you.  All right, thank you a lot.  So, wrestling needs.  Smackdown tonight.  What?  Another man kissing the ass of another man.  It's good.  It's good, right?  Yeah.  Nice.  It's good.  Oh, my God.  Someone's checking in on instant feedback.  This is horrible.  He picked up a girl, went to a hotel room.  Yeah.  And he woke up. 
[00:45:00]  All of a sudden, he was going to have sex with her.  But then he blacked out, I guess.  When he woke up, he was in a bathtub full of ice.  And there was a note that said, get yourself to a hospital immediately.  Turns out, he had a big incision on his back.  Opie, they had taken his kidney.  Well, then he's going to die before he gets to the hospital.  No, no.  That's why they put him on ice.  And they gave him the note telling him to go to the hospital like he wouldn't know.  Jeez, a little back pain.  I think I need an Advil.  How long can you live without kidneys, you think? 
[00:45:30]  Arr.  With one kidney, you could live for a while.  I know.  But you would bleed or something.  I know a few people that got that one kidney transplant thing.  Sure.  And they're doing quite nice.  Well, I think if they cut it out and took it from you, I think you better go and have  some antibiotics and whatnot.  What's the story about the guy, the woman who gets on the elevator?  It used to be Mike Tyson and then he was Eddie Murphy.  Right.  Eddie Murphy.  Get down or get on the floor.  Yeah.  Hit the floor.  Hit the floor.  I was talking to his dog. 
[00:46:00]  The person got down on the floor because they thought they were going to be robbed.  And then he sent their roses.  He sent their roses.  He sent their roses.  We have to take a break, but I think we have time for one more call here.  John, what's up?  Hey, guys.  I've got an urban legend I don't think you've heard about.  Last night when I came home from work, my wife had a nice big dinner waiting for me.  Yeah.  Then afterwards, she gave me a real nice back rub.  Oh, good, good, good.  And then right before bed, she gave me oral treats. 
[00:46:30]  So you want to add that to the urban legend category.  Yes, please.  Very nice.  Thank you, John.  Take care.  We have some funny efforts to listen to this show.  Anthony, as we go to break, another clip from the last time we did the homeless shopping  spree two years ago.  Remember Gray Wolf?  Gray Wolf.  Yes, the Indian fellow.  I'm talking the cowboy killing variety, not the dot head.  I don't know if Gray Wolf is joining us this year.  Hopefully, we'll be talking to some more of the homeless people that will be joining us.  Yes.  Well, here's a clip from Gray Wolf two years ago. 
[00:47:00]  Hey, what's your name?  My name is Gray Wolf.  Gray Wolf?  Gray Wolf.  I like that name.  Where did you get that name from?  It's from the Indian community house.  It's an Indian name.  Right on.  Now what?  From the Chiaquah Apaches.  Now, where do you live?  Right now, I was living in New York here with my ex-old lady and my child.  Right.  Find out that she was cheating on me, so I threw myself on the streets.  Family reasons for one.  And I left.  Is that the peace pipe?  What do you got there?  Call me Thomas.  This is a flute.  He's got a flute.  Oh, can you play the flute for us, Gray Wolf? 
[00:47:30]  Native American Indian music.  Yeah, you can lower the mic.  Maybe someone lower the mic for Gray Wolf there.  Hey, kid.  You can figure it out.  Wow.  Must feel like I'm in desert.  Arizona. 
[00:48:00]  Arizona.  Very nice.  Gray Wolf, everyone.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  1027 WNEW.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:48:30]  So, we have to give props out to our San Francisco affiliate, Anthony.  Yes.  KYCY.  They're playing Motorhead during the break.  Oh, that's good.  I'm playing Motorhead.  That's a huge improvement over the lame country music they decided goes well with the Opie and  Anthony Show when we take a break.  Pretty hardcore there, Motorhead.  How you doing?  You doing?  Oh, my God.  I thought I was getting arrested or something.  I thought you were a detective in this building that requires me to stand on a line, you know, 
[00:49:00]  because this is your show.  It's so important.  What in the name of God is in this building that anybody gives an S about?  That's our security staff downstairs.  I'll show you my pass, okay?  I have to get a goddamn pass to get up into this building.  Oh, you didn't know?  Dick Cheney's here.  When we can't find him, you know, that secret location they talk about?  It's right here.  888 7th Avenue. 
[00:49:30]  I thought he had a subpoena or something.  I know.  You're looking very adaptive.  Grab a mic.  Joe, skate over to the next mic.  It's like the Tonight Show.  You have to go down the couch.  You smell good, Lewis.  Well, just for you, honey.  You do.  Was this the conversation that was taking place in the jail cell last year with you two convicts?  It was, because I'll tell you, people wanted to stand next to me because I was the last man to smell good.  You are dressed very nicely.  I've got to go to do the Daily Show after this. 
[00:50:00]  But you've never dressed like this when you come in here.  Yeah, but it's not for you guys.  Yeah, it's for the Daily Show.  But it's for the Daily Show.  Do you always wear a suit during that segment?  Yes.  Not lately.  It's usually naked on the Daily Show.  Yeah, yeah, naked.  And recently, they were going to have me buck naked, but we skipped that.  That's great.  That'll pull in those viewers.  You know, whatever I can do.  Whatever I can do.  Whatever is necessary.  You know?  All right.  I'm up against the war.  I'm up against the war. 
[00:50:30]  That's true.  How am I going to get my rating?  You've got to think that.  And you're complaining to us?  You've got to think that.  It seems a lot of people like listening to news stations, Lewis.  Yes, they certainly do.  You know?  It's very hard to do the obligatory penile joke when people's lives hang in a balance somewhere  across the world.  Well, when there's breaking news, we tell everyone.  Right.  It's the same old crap.  When there's something new, we tell them.  We'll let you know.  There isn't much new.  Do you love Rumsfeld, Lewis, or what? 
[00:51:00]  He's the best.  What do you think?  He's the best.  Yeah.  The guy, he has shut these press people up.  When this first happened, and Rumsfeld would get out there, he'd get the press in front  of him, and they'd all start asking the questions they had been used to asking for years, trying  to trick the guy into saying something that they could put on the front page as, this guy's  an animal, or a monster, or a pervert, or a racist, or something.  And they're throwing these questions at him, and he would just answer, yeah.  Our intention is to kill them. 
[00:51:30]  And then, of course, they're like, oh, so what you're saying is your intention really  is, oh, geez, he just said to kill them.  It diffused my whole plan here.  He's telling you?  I love this guy.  I know.  He was a better middle than Norton was.  Right.  Who would have thunk it?  Goddamn, you comics are ruthless.  I wish he was my grandfather, man.  You like to have a grandpa like that?  Oh, yeah, no, I'd rather have an alcoholic grandpa that I never got to know, because 
[00:52:00]  he died when I was six months old.  Ouch.  Wow.  Well, a little personal there, a little bit.  I think I'm going to have to go.  That's a little bit too much sharing.  I love Rumsfeld's hair.  Dude, he has the best hairdo ever.  You like that?  Perfect in the 1950s, man.  He does look like he stepped out of the 50s.  Yes.  He's got that look, that Reagan grease on his hair.  Yeah, and he comes over, even when it's in color, he's in black and white.  He's in black and white on the podium.  Great.  Love the guy, though. 
[00:52:30]  Now, his latest reaction to this Mullah wanting to surrender.  Yeah.  He wants to surrender.  This is the guy, the head of the Taliban.  He's been in this besieged city now, the last stronghold of the Taliban.  And now he's been saying, fight to the death.  Kill the Americans.  We will show them.  Now he's trying to broker a deal for himself to get out of there and live in Afghanistan.  No penalties, nothing. 
[00:53:00]  Just, all right, I'll surrender, but you've got to let me stay here and live.  And Rumsfeld just turned around and goes, what?  Get out of here.  No.  This guy either gives himself up to go to military tribunals, which I love that whole idea.  Just a secret trial where they listen and go, blah, blah, blah, hang him.  I love that.  I love it.  It's like watching the old Nuremberg trial.  Did you think one of those guys are going to go, whoo, I got a raise.  This is great.  And my lawyer got me a deal. 
[00:53:30]  No, it was blah, blah, blah, shoot him.  That's exactly what these things are all about.  And I love that.  It's very open, very public, that they're saying, no, this is what we want to do.  And now this guy wants to broker a deal, and they're saying, no, you will face the music.  And this guy should.  I love it.  We have Yemen's necks, by the way.  In the risk game, Yemen's necks.  Yemen.  Madagascar.  We have some Rumsfeld audio from last night on Larry King. 
[00:54:00]  Do we?  Yeah, he says some great stuff.  And he's not shy about the talk shows.  No.  This guy's a star.  He'll go.  He'll do anything.  I love how he starts joking before he starts his press conference.  He's into joking around a little bit.  That was a good joke.  Now, let's talk about the dead sand monkeys.  All right, here's Rumsfeld and Larry King last night.  U.S. response to terrorists.  It is impossible to defend against terrorists in every place, at every moment, against every technique. 
[00:54:30]  The only way you can do that is to take the battle to them.  And therefore, you use the word retaliation.  I don't think of it as retaliation.  I think of it as self-defense.  What we're doing is self-defense.  You're not retaliating.  No.  I mean, it's not retribution.  Or revenge.  Or revenge.  In my mind, goodness, no.  That's not what I'm about.  What I'm about is we've got a wonderful country.  And thousands of Americans were killed.  And they were killed by people who have vowed to do it again and again. 
[00:55:00]  And we can't let them do that.  Bravo.  We simply are not going to change our way of life.  We're free people.  That is what we are.  And we're not going to live in a fortress.  And we're not going to live in underground and tunnels.  And we're not going to spend every minute of our waking days looking around for someone afraid they might kill us.  We can't function that.  That's how boss goes around every day.  You get the chills, though.  Don't you love a great... 
[00:55:30]  You know, it's been so long since we got a nice, hard-ass American speech like this type of guy.  You know, how long did we listen to...  And the bombing of the cold.  We will handle this.  And I swear we're going to hunt these people down.  And nothing.  We got nothing out of that guy.  Well, we got plenty out of him.  Ended up on dresses and women's mouths and whatever else.  We got eight years of work.  For us.  For us.  I'll give it to you.  Schmuck.  But there is... 
[00:56:00]  You know something, though?  Leading this country is a balancing act.  And he was completely one-sided.  Great.  We had a great economy going.  Of which I don't think he had anything to do with.  It ebbs and flows, the economy of this country.  And it's just based on economics.  It has nothing to do with what this Clinton guy was doing.  But, as far as foreign policy went, this guy knew nothing.  He didn't respond to threats.  The intelligence of this country was just decimated. 
[00:56:30]  It was awful.  It went from the guy that used to run the goddamn CIA being in the White House to nothing.  We knew...  We didn't know that these guys were planning this for years.  Yeah, but that...  You know, I mean, I'm not saying, you know, don't get me to defend putzo.  But, you know, when you've got an FBI that they just announced that the FBI and the CIA will finally talk to local policemen and give them information.  This is...  They've been out of their minds as a group for years. 
[00:57:00]  The FBI and the CIA.  And, yeah, completely.  I mean, they wouldn't talk...  A, they wouldn't talk to each other, and they wouldn't talk to the schmuck local cop.  I mean, come on.  It was a group of insane people.  Well, you know something...  Now, hopefully...  But it took this...  Because they wouldn't have talked to each other unless something huge happened.  But they were doing nothing.  You know something during the Cold War?  You're talking to the security guy downstairs in this building.  The CIA is with him now.  Get over it, Logan.  During the Cold War... 
[00:57:30]  You're in now.  During the Cold War, they were...  They did their job.  It was intelligence gathering.  Right.  And whether they told local...  I don't think the threat to our country directly was as big as it is now.  So talking to local police officials wasn't really relevant then.  But they were out doing their job, getting information on threats to this country.  And for some reason, for the eight years that Putzo, as you so eloquently put it, was in office, 
[00:58:00]  this was not being done.  The threats to our country were not being looked into.  And it's directly appointed Clinton, as far as being responsible.  And the people he appointed or didn't appoint, or appointed because it was politically correct.  You know, you want a guy like Rumsfeld in there that's going to shake some crap up and scare people, quite frankly.  Not, who can I appoint that'll fit this group or this race or this sex?  There's only two, right?  Male, female.  Sure. 
[00:58:30]  But, you know, he was always about what it would look like, what the image would be, as opposed to how effective it would be.  And you saw the results.  September 11th.  But the results, you know, you keep acting.  I mean, we're very, very lucky that Rumsfeld's there.  We're extremely lucky.  But the fact of the matter is, is Putz Boy 2, who's in charge now, came rolling in and had the information,  the same information, that somebody better do something.  It's a nut house out there. 
[00:59:00]  He did nothing.  He did nothing.  Hey, hey, how long was he in office before they did that?  I don't care.  The guy should have gotten some info.  No, the info was this.  We had a ton of money, a ton, more money than God.  We had enough money that we weren't even going to use oil.  We were going to burn the money and keep it warm.  And he, and instead of using the money to say, like, hey, maybe we should do something about airport security,  he said, let's send everybody a $300 check. 
[00:59:30]  And it's not just him, it's the schmuck Democrats.  So to sit here and defend either side, Rumsfeld is great, but we get them one at a time.  It's one at a time.  We're lucky if we get three together in a room who can.  Very good.  But I must return.  Oh, I feel better now.  Now, you say that Putz number two is in there now, and he didn't use any of this information or do anything.  No.  The first act of terrorism he had to deal with was September 11th. 
[01:00:00]  A little on the large scale.  If he would have been in office, I honestly believe if he was in office when something like the coal happened  or the embassy bombings happened, I think a lot more would have been accomplished than Putz on number one accomplished.  Now, that may be true.  That may be true.  Yeah.  But I'm just saying.  I'm placing it on the first act of terrorism that happened in his administration.  I'm saying.  Excuse me.  It was two buildings falling down.  The information was there.  It's not just him.  It's the Democrats and the Republicans.  It's not just one person.  I'll agree with you.  We have a group of schmucks who got information and ignored it. 
[01:00:30]  And we didn't even have, I mean, for God's sake, I mean, and I will say that Clinton's got a ton to do with it,  but I'll also say the CIA who employs the people when you're dealing with a group of nutjobs in the middle of a desert  and you don't have a couple of guys who speak Pashtun and you're advertising for it on CNN.  Holy God.  All I got to say is holy God.  But when you're in the CIA and the FBI and you're in there under an administration 
[01:01:00]  that does not allow you to use politically incorrect methods like hiring informants that have police records,  do you believe that one?  Oh, well, you know something?  They're giving money to informants that have records?  That's why they're informants.  They're rats.  Yeah, but for some reason, it wouldn't look good to the Clinton administration to be dealing with those people.  And tactics, tactics as far as immigrants in this country go and how we talk to them and deal with them, 
[01:01:30]  it wouldn't look good as far as Clinton's concerned.  I like what we're doing now.  We rounded up a thousand of them and they're sitting on their ass somewhere until we get around to them.  I like that.  I feel a little safer.  And there is a difference between Democrats and Republicans because you look after the Pan Am bombing,  when it was made apparent that it was Gaddafi, there was a couple of bombs dropped on his house.  Right.  And he killed one of his dumb kids and he has shut his mouth ever since.  Great for Ronald Reagan.  He's like behind us now, I think, Gaddafi.  Oh, I love him. 
[01:02:00]  Anthony, CNN is telling dick jokes at this point.  Oh, did that happen?  The crossover has happened.  Yeah, I just...  But they're not telling him.  They're actually on the bottom banner.  He's rolling with the stock ticker.  They're wearing Groucho Marx glasses at this point.  That's right.  I love talking with Lewis.  It's a lot of fun.  By the way, Lewis, we cannot promote any comedy gigs that you're doing because we've reached our quota, quite frankly.  Right.  Right.  You mean we've reached our quota?  Oh, are you talking about maybe Adam Ferrara and Joe Curry being a governor's in Levittown? 
[01:02:30]  That's right.  Thursday, Friday, and Saturday.  That's right.  And then you've got Jay Moore playing Rascals tomorrow night for two shows.  That's in Jersey.  Jim Norton's got a gig.  It's funny you should say that.  I honestly forgot.  I'm Saturday night.  I have to do it.  I have to plug this gig.  My friend Ward, who starred in the comedy, is booking a room called...  And this is the worst comedy name.  Ward, you should be shot in the stomach for this.  It's called Jersey Jokers.  Oh, God.  Sounds like a gay advocate. 
[01:03:00]  I know.  I know.  I know.  Jersey Jokers?  Jersey Jokers.  Because I'm in Jersey, and I'll be telling jokes.  Elbow, elbow.  Hubbler, hubbler.  And it's in, you know, it's in a Holiday Inn.  Oh, wow.  Look at Lewis.  He's looking at you in horror.  Horror in his eyes.  You're going to tell jokes in a Holiday Inn.  In Toms River, New Jersey.  I don't know the exact address, but I'm sure there's only one in that awful town.  So go around there.  Go to Jersey Jokers.  That's great. 
[01:03:30]  Saturday night.  Jersey Jokers.  Jersey Jokers.  Yeah, but it's your magic.  The room will change.  I heard it's a good day.  They'll feel like they're on a cruise ship.  It's the name.  Well, no.  I was just in a worse name.  What?  Uncle Funnies.  I did not play Uncle Funnies.  Uncle Funnies in Davy, Florida.  Not even...  Uncle Funnies.  Not even David, Florida.  Davy.  Named after Davy and Goliath.  Did you buy a T-shirt?  It was unbelievable.  I need an Uncle Funnies.  You know damn well, the owner, his family thought he was funny, and he got his little 
[01:04:00]  nieces and nephews, oh, look who's got Uncle Funnies coming over, Uncle Funny, and he  opened up the club.  You know that's how it happened.  Because they would probably be wrong to name it after the other uncle, Uncle Balloon  Not Invader.  Uncle touch me where my bathing suit covers.  Now, I have to tell you, one of the great stories from my time there, because every night,  I said I was going to go in there with just a tape recorder to tape the audiences, because  I'd just tape, literally, I've never heard some of the stuff that I've heard coming from 
[01:04:30]  an audience.  Every night, something would happen.  First night, Friday night, second show, which you always know is the night, you know,  they're liquored up, and you're like, they don't have weapons, and I'll beat my wife  later, and the guy sitting next to six girls are talking in the back of the room, I can  hear them, I'm just yelling over them, odd, and the guy stands up, 15 minutes left in  the show, and goes, shut the F up, do you hear me, shut the F up, and it was like one 
[01:05:00]  of the greatest moments, and he's standing there, and the whole room just freezes, you  know, turns, they all look at him, the girl stands up and goes, I'm not going to shut  up, and so now I got this guy, and now he's fabulous, that's great, but he is just, he's  reached that point, I've never seen an audience member who was sitting next to a group of people  who talk, just go completely across the line, completely, and I don't know, he's got fired  on him, he's going, I will kill you, I will kill you, and I went out afterwards, and the 
[01:05:30]  guy, they had taken him aside, and they thought he must be the nuts, and I was saying, you know,  that he was in the right, and they took him aside, and within like 30 seconds, he said,  I'm really sorry, I met the guy, he said, you know, he's like this calm, he reached his  limit, he just said, he said, I just, he said, you know, I paid money, right, I paid, I paid  a lot of money, and then they put me in smoking, and then I was sitting next to these, you know,  these C's, and he was, and he had every right, there are people out there that, you know, 
[01:06:00]  you do, you pay money to go to a movie, or a show, or wherever you're going, that decide  that you hearing them talk is a little more important, and a little more entertaining  than what you paid for, it happens at the movies all the time, I cannot, I cannot go to  a movie these days without wanting to just take a weapon with me, and just open fire on  whoever's yapping, because they're just, and they're loud, louder than they need to  be, even, because I think their story, they feel it's so interesting, that they want everyone 
[01:06:30]  to hear it, now the best, now the second best, is, that's followed by Saturday, early  show, the guy, guy sitting in front of him, completely drunk, it's like 10 o'clock, I knew  it was, I knew something would be coming from him, because his eyes are glazed, but he's  like, and he's kind of mumbling, and I do a Christmas, you know, Hanukkah thing, because  that's the kind of, you know, cerebral comic I am, oh happy Hanukkah, by the way, oh  yeah, oh it's a fun time for all of us, spin that little top of yours, yeah right, that's 
[01:07:00]  right, I love that, feel good, Christ killer, all monorail up there, so the guy says, I'm  doing the Christmas Hanukkah bit, and he's going, you're trying to separate Christians and  Jews, aren't you, that's what you're doing, and I said, and I said, absolutely right,  I'm glad, oh my God, you're on to me, you know, and that was, and then he kind of calmed  down, and he came back, and then, and then I started doing this thing, I do this thing 
[01:07:30]  about Pepsi and Britney Spears, and, you're trying to separate Pepsi and Britney, no better,  you know, Pepsi's a Jewish corporation, I was like, all of a sudden, his agenda became  crystal clear, oh yeah, god damn Jew, you know, and I said, I said to him, I said, I didn't  know Pepsi was a Jewish corporation, because he was standing up here, and then, and then  he, and then I said, and besides, I said, if you think we Jews owned something, we'd call 
[01:08:00]  it Pepsi, it'd be called Spritz, all right, we have to take a break, Anthony, it wasn't  Richard Milhouse Nixon in the audience, come on, make me laugh, Jew boy, like my old speech  writer, Ben Stein, Ben, get your pop in here, you two kikes write me something about the  colors, I don't like Pepsi, where's Kissinger, get him in here, I love a heave that talks like

[01:10:30]  you strap-on, oh, the chin, the chin, the chin dildo, the accommodator, yeah, the accommodator,  we had the accommodator right here, the girls using it, they wouldn't let me bring it on  the air, how, why is that, I wonder, because, you know, you can say, you know, South Park can  say, oh my God, South Park can say that we can't even mention here, they've lost their  effing minds on South Park, and we couldn't, and I'm going, and I'm sitting in the office  going, well, you know, it's a, it's a penis, and I'm sitting there, yeah, and so, and I'm 
[01:11:00]  like, completely like, that's, you know, we can say, there's the line, that's the line,  that's the line, you bring up a good point, because we, we're in these meetings too, and  I, and you have to take yourself out of the meeting, while you're sitting there and going,  am I really arguing over the word twat for the last half hour, I swear, like, we're  grown-ups, and we get in these situations, and, and you're arguing your point why the  word twat needs to be on the radio, and you should be able to use the chin dildo and show 
[01:11:30]  it on the air, and then, so, well, we'd have to digitize it out, and then it would lose  its joke, and I'm like, well, you know, you know, what do we, who cares, we had it in  the studio, they were using it, and you don't want to get off the road, it's the silliest  looking thing, like, who would use that? Well, you know what the best part was, and  see, and then it drives you nuts, because she's right, I wrote all this stuff while I was  on the road for it, because they sent me a picture of it, and I went nuts, and so I  come back, and I got, and I realize, well, I'm sitting around, like, I just get up one  morning, and I have my coffee before I get on the plane to fly back to write, to, to come 
[01:12:00]  to do the, uh, yesterday, and they've got, and I go, I've seen this before, it's, it's  Lincoln, it's Lincoln on the penny, if you look at his beard, his beard is, he's the  first, he's the great accommodator, you know, that's how he got, it's how he got through  the Civil War, with the chin dildo, you know, his was the first, he just grew it until it  was big enough, as a matter of fact, when he was doing the Gettysburg Address, he was 
[01:12:30]  trying to see what he could say in it, or what not, you know, chin dildo, and you can't  use it on your show, it was really disappointing, censorship, and meanwhile, like South Park, like  he was saying last night, unbelievable, uh, episode of South Park, aborted fetuses, uh,  there was, no, no, there was, um, people, there was a, a, a firm that does stem cell research  that was collecting aborted fetuses from abortion clinics, the truck overturned on the icy highway, 
[01:13:00]  and Cartman collected all of the aborted fetuses, calls up his friends, guess what I got, I got  40 aborted fetuses, and, and then he's trying to sell them to the people that do stem cell  research, he's in his room with the aborted fetuses stacked up behind him on the phone  going, so, uh, what do you want to give me for these aborted fetuses, and he's like wheeling  and dealing, and they get away with that, but you can't get away with your thing, that's  no problem, no, but we can't do it, no chin dildo, we miss Lewis has been gone, yeah, we'd 
[01:13:30]  like to update our friends, yeah, sure, we're doing the homeless shopping spree, Tuesday,  Tuesday, second annual, perfect, this is great, this is where we get to give back, Lewis, is  what, uh, people always talk about that, if you do well in life, you gotta give back to  the community, we take a busload of the most stinky, uh, urine drenched homeless, feces  smeared homeless, uh, not the, not the really functional ones either, I'm talking drunk, disgusting  homeless, load them on a bus and take them to a posh mall around the area, give them a 
[01:14:00]  hundred dollars, and let them shop and try on Versace suits with their smelly bodies  and whatnot, it's such a, uh, fun, Christmassy thing to do, they really seem to enjoy it, and  then they all go out and drink and vomit, it's such a great time, it's what Christmas is all  about, the mall ends up hating us, where do you take them to, which mall, what are you  surprised, secret, secret, everyone's trying to figure it out, but we haven't even decided 
[01:14:30]  two years ago, three malls, two years ago, short hills, we took them to short hills,  did you, two years ago, it was, but the people out of town, the short hills mall, I mean,  they have carpeting, I mean, it is, do they, ballet parking, it's a, it's a very high end  mall, and they were horrified, they were pulling down the grates as the homeless people were  coming to try to shop into their, I was actually, I was, there's a couple of malls that are so  large on the road that I walk into that I think you actually need a pack animal to go with  you, a piece of bird, well you do, once you park the car, you don't know if you're  ever going to see it again, once you enter the bowels of certain malls, especially around 
[01:15:00]  holiday parking, is another thing where I would like to just open up and start shooting,  because it's, we play a game too, remember going Christmas shopping, you play the I'm  going to my car game, to F with people, the people going very slow up and down the aisle,  waiting for that one in a million shot that you're passing the car that people are actually  getting into, to leave the spot, and then you jam on the brakes and fight with the guy 
[01:15:30]  across from you that I was here first kind of thing, so we would walk, and of course we're  parked in nowhere, you know, a mile away from the mall, but as you're walking back to your  car, you can have fun, try this out at your mall, walk toward a car that's relatively close  to the mall, just slowly walk to get your keys out and start walking toward it, and just  park across to the other side of the aisle of the car, you're all pissed, the person's  like, but he was getting, hey, hey, get in that car, I don't care, it's not yours, they  get so aggravated, and you do it the whole way, they follow you, they tell you as you're 
[01:16:00]  walking, and then you walk to a nice car, and you go, oh, I'm leaving, and then you go  like, you snap your finger up, oh, like you forgot something, start walking back, they  will get so pissed off, it's beautiful.  Why don't they just park and walk, you know what it is, they're with the fat, lazy, stupid  three kid wives, and they don't want to get out of the car, I'm tired, I don't want to  walk, just park in the back and walk, man, who cares?  Roll around in front of the place, park it yourself.  Yeah, just drag that fat pig in from the back.  Yeah, so we're doing the homeless shopping spree this coming Tuesday, I'm hoping that 
[01:16:30]  a few more of the homeless guys are going to call in today, Anthony.  Yes.  We met Tipsy Tom yesterday.  The homeless guys are going to call in from their, what, from their cell phones?  Well, we have ways.  We have a liaison that's out there on the street.  We're negotiating deals that actually give them the cell phone they can call.  We have a clip from the last time we did the homeless shopping spree, another Christmas  song from one of the homeless guys, right?  This is what, quickly, this is what we want to do, too. 
[01:17:00]  We got Christmas songs from some of these homeless people.  We want to get them all to do it and do Homeless for the Holidays, a CD of all homeless people  singing Christmas songs, maybe like this.  Are you ready?  One, and a two, and a three.  Here we go.  All I want for Christmas is my two front teeth.  My two front teeth.  My two front teeth.  All I want for Christmas is my two front teeth.  And I can wish you Merry Christmas. 
[01:17:30]  All right.  So they can't read.  So they can't read.  Yeah, well, we had them singing Christmas songs as they were heading to the mall.  The song means a little more to them than to most people, too.  They truly would like their two front teeth.  Caroline, Brian, what's up?  Hey, how are you?  Hey.  I wanted to say my favorite line from South Park last night.  Yeah.  It was during the wheeling and dealing, and Cartman was trying to negotiate on the phone,  and he said, just like the unborn fetuses, I wasn't born yesterday either. 
[01:18:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Don't try to pull anything over on me.  Just like a unborn fetus, I wasn't born yesterday.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Really bad.  All right.  You're breaking my buzz.  So that's going on, Lewis.  Yeah, I think maybe because Daily Show is rerun, and then it's shown, like, in the morning,  maybe that's why in South Park never ends.  Oh, it doesn't make sense.  And it's driving Lewis black nuts.  Yeah, really.  Yeah, like the kids have never seen a penis.  You know, most of the kids, actually, their penises are digitized until they're at 12. 
[01:18:30]  Wow.  I like that.  So that's happening Tuesday, Lewis.  Tomorrow on the show, we're playing What the Hell is That?  Oh, I can't imagine.  We've got a team of doctors coming down and a lot of people that have stuff on their body  that they don't know what it is.  Yeah.  And we're going to get diagnosed tomorrow.  A lot of courage, you guys.  Have you?  Yeah.  It'll be nice that you bring in the first guy with smallpox.  That'll be a fun thing.  That'll be a fun thing for you.  More importantly, tomorrow we all find out what Twato is for the first time. 
[01:19:00]  Ah.  Now, you've seen Twato, haven't you, on Sandy Kane?  Yes.  That growth, that thing.  Yeah.  We are going to actually, we are finally going to have that diagnosed and see what it is  because we think it's genital warts.  I don't, it's beyond that.  Yeah.  It looks like a, it's a cauliflower.  I think it's like an alien suction thing.  Do you?  Yeah.  I think it's a conjoined retarded twin.  Actually, she would be the conjoined retarded.  We'll make you giggle, I'll tell you. 
[01:19:30]  We played, Mommy, what were you doing for Britney Spears tickets?  The show was last night.  The girl, Erin, she had a suck on Stalker Patty's hammer toes.  Have you ever seen hammer toes, Lewis?  Yeah.  It's some kind of thing that happens with a lower knuckle on the big toe that it all  of a sudden cuts a hard right hand turn into the other toes.  Yes.  And not only that, it says, she says, Patty says, because of my hammer toes, I'm talking  like Patty, because of my hammer toes, I can't cut my toenails because it hurts. 
[01:20:00]  So she's got these huge, well, like, well, why is potato chips that Norton's eating right  now type of toenails that he was eating?  Like Frito-Lays.  Yeah.  Like Frito-Jones.  It's a corn chip, big, hard, long, and sharp.  So we made this girl, Erin, suck on Stalker Patty's toes.  Well, she did it.  She won the tickets.  Her boyfriend said, I'm not kissing you until you gargle or...  Well, go to a doctor.  Right, because she had a fungus.  Well, yeah, but what happened on the way home from our show, she realized, wait, I got 
[01:20:30]  a little cut.  Oh.  My mouth.  Oh.  She cut the roof of her mouth with Patty's toes.  Oh.  And within a day, that little cut became a much bigger problem.  Oh, man.  Wait to the doctor.  Fungus.  She's got fungus on the roof of her mouth.  The doctor has never seen it before.  He said maybe he's seen it like one other time or something.  He said he's only seen that one other time, and he was laughing at her because she told  him how she got it.  So she's on antibiotics to clear up the fungus on the roof of her mouth with Stalker Patty's 
[01:21:00]  toes.  And I think she's actually at the doctor now doing another follow-up.  It's getting drained or something, right?  Oh.  It's full of pus.  Oh, stop, stop, stop.  And Stalker Patty's outside?  Yeah.  I wonder how she feels knowing that what's crawling on her feet requires people.  That is disgusting.  What the hell she's growing in there?  Patty, look at this. 
[01:21:30]  Louis, stop undressing her with your eyes.  I see you.  Hey, Louis has been going on a long time.  Take off your wig.  Take off the wig, Patty.  Well, why don't you explain it to me?  No, just take it off.  We do the show.  You do what we say.  Take it off.  They make me cut my hair for you two tickets.  Look at that.  Oh, that is, that's like out of pictures I saw as a child.  Of course it is.  Take that off a minute.  Take it off again, Patty.  Patty, please, just take it off.  It's growing. 
[01:22:00]  Look at that.  Louis, does that not look like somebody in jackboots should be giving her the thumbs up  or the thumbs down out of a box car?  Exactly.  No, that is so wrong.  That is just, exactly.  And I thought it, but you said it so well.  I didn't say Nazi once.  I saw a lady go by today with hair shorter than that.  Oh, yeah?  Like a hairstyle.  On her way to chemo, was she?  No, Sinead O'Connor.  Show freaking Louis your feet.  Oh.  They're not.  Put them up there.  Just put them up there.  Put it up. 
[01:22:30]  Look at that toenail.  Oh, Louis.  What do you think?  You know, for Britney Spears tickets, yeah, that's the price.  And she's stocked on it.  It's not, it may not be her fault.  God may just be punishing her for trying to get Britney Spears tickets.  Oh.  And why is Patty here today?  Do we know?  She's going to have her feet checked by a podiatrist who's coming in.  Hey, Louis, back in black.  That's what's under Patty's toes, too.  I take a shower every day.  I got good hygiene. 
[01:23:00]  Patty wanted to defend herself yesterday.  The girl's got a fungus in her mouth.  Yeah, Patty.  She cut the roof of her mouth on your razor blade-like toenails.  I swear to God, they wouldn't let you on a plane with those toenails.  You could take over the flight deck.  I asked if I could watch Britney.  It's like a box cutter on your feet.  Don't you know that if you have your feet in a sock and a shoe, you're walking around,  it's dirty again.  You've got to wash it with soap and water.  Ah.  So she sucked on your toe, cut the roof of her mouth, and now she's got the AIDS. 
[01:23:30]  She does not.  Or something similar.  It can't be that because I'm not active.  Oh, yeah.  Ron Jeremy picked you up like a bowling ball, but you haven't had sex with any man.  She's a virgin, yet she let Ron Jeremy fondle her.  The only guy.  She says the reason she hasn't been with a man ever in her life is because I'm looking for the right man.  And I want to find the right man before I let him touch me like that.  The right man one day was Ron Jeremy. 
[01:24:00]  No, trust me.  He's not the right guy.  He's a little too advanced for me.  If you put all the hole he's had end-to-end, it's like the chunnel over there in Europe.  Ron is a little too advanced for me.  I need somebody more on my level.  You're on level.  We can find an 11-year-old.  No, that's okay.  As long as she's not Puerto Rican, Opie.  That's okay, Opie.  Thank you.  And you assume she wanted some lesbianism there. 
[01:24:30]  No, not that either.  I don't go that way.  All right, Patty.  Well, thank you.  So you're going to get a pedicure today.  Who's the poor son of a bitch that should draw hazard pay for having to do that?  I don't know.  Is it one of our special forces?  We actually have two doctors coming in.  Two doctors to do a pedicure?  They're bringing all a bunch of equipment.  They're going to take a look at her feet.  Black and Decker Sawzall or something.  Yeah, pretty much.  They're going to look at her feet.  They're going to give her a diagnosis.  When did you guys become the hospital ship hope? 
[01:25:00]  I leave for like four weeks.  I come back.  Oh, we're going to be curing cancer here next Thursday.  Red cross painted on the door.  I like it.  This is the new and improved O.P. and Anthony.  We're much more sensitive, though.  Oh, man.  We're trying to help people.  We're twisted, though, man.  We have a hot porn star outside, and we blow her off to get Stalker Patty in here.  Everybody, get to surgery.  Get to surgery.  Incoming wounded. 
[01:25:30]  All in a smash.  Get the wounded.  Get them to triage.  Oh, my God.  Patty's feet is a goner.  Put a toe tag on it.  Engine 51.  Squad 51.  Proceed to the O.P. and Anthony show.  Rampart.  Rampart.  I hope the girl's okay.  I hope the girl's okay.  Well, we can't get her on the phone because she's at the doctor. 
[01:26:00]  Oh.  You're like a green monkey with your diseases.  I'm like a green.  That African green monkey that started the AIDS before the Asians.  Hey, I'm not a monkey.  Oh, my God.  Make me a nice kitten instead of a monkey.  I'd rather crawl into a dryer full of razor blades with Magic Johnson than suck on your toe.  Oh, wow.  Wow.  Are you?  Wow.  It wouldn't be my thing anyway. 
[01:26:30]  Hey, Jason from England.  What's up?  Oh, yes.  Hello, gentlemen.  How are you?  Hello.  I'd just like to mention a couple of points which will probably slow down.  Perfect.  And I don't want you to cut me off.  But anyway, yesterday I was listening to a gentleman on your show that impersonated that hideous gentleman who does the boxing.  Merchant.  Merchant.  Larry Merchant.  Larry Merchant.  Yes.  My God.  He's awful.  But one thing that next time you see him I'd like you to look at is the expression on the face of his partner 
[01:27:00]  while Mr. Merchant is talking because he doesn't want to kill him.  But anyway, one quick point.  Oh, oh, rather.  One quick point.  The Ozzy Osbourne thing.  I moved here a couple of years.  So, Anthony, Mr. Patty's going to get her feet worked on.  He was going to talk about Ozzy.  Yeah, but he, oh, that annoying accent.  He knows him.  I think that was Tony Blair, by the way.  He's been out of the press lately.  He wants to get on the show.  Who's outside?  Terry?  Oh, boy, is she hot.  Terry Weigel?  Uh-huh.  She's going to host the Porn Awards. 
[01:27:30]  And didn't she give you oral treats once?  Briefly.  Oh, it's a porn star.  Oh, she's hot.  Yeah.  Oh, briefly.  Briefly.  She, like, loved and said...  Briefly.  I wouldn't admit that to a million people right now.  Oh, man.  Briefly.  She is so hot.  Yeah.  Oh, God, is she sexy.  But she really gave you some treats.  A little oral treat.  And it was a goof on another thing, you know.  It was on another show.  On the thing with the ding.  It was on the oral treat show.  It's on at 6 to 7. 
[01:28:00]  She's a porn star and she hosts what?  She's going to host the Porn Awards, Anthony.  Where they give out the awards.  That's my favorite.  I love...  Best Anal and all that.  Yeah, I love any award show that has the category Best Anal.  It's like, what...  Isn't it all just good?  How do they judge what anal scene in porno is better than another?  Even better, though, is they actually give the acceptance speech.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Ouch.  I'd like to thank...  Ow.  All right.  Let's take a quick break and we'll get Terry in here, right? 
[01:28:30]  That's right.  Lewis Black playing Caroline's third way through Sunday.  Yep.  I think we're going down.  A few of us will go down tonight.  Oh, hell yeah.  And, Lewis, you're hanging out.  I got another 10.  Where do you got to go?  I got to go to the ding.  Oh, you got to do the ding.  You only have 10 minutes left?  Yeah.  Remember when he used to hang out?  Oh, the whole show.  What happened then?  No matter how hard we try to get rid of him, he'd stay the whole show.  No, I remember when I hung out the whole show because there was nothing but me and you.  And then the coffee machine.  And then we would kind of look at rats running in the studio. 
[01:29:00]  All right.  I'll give you that.  And we'd rub their stomachs.  You make a good one.  All right.  We'll have him a little bit for next break.  Now he's a big shot.  He's a big shot.  I know.  Wait a minute.  He's a big shot with that, Norton?  How would you know?  What?  His big delicious C.  So what?  For some reason, Norton knows that.  Oh, I'll keep that between you two.  Well, it only helps our career, obviously.  I learned something in jail.  Well, there's radio, there's energy, there's psychotic, and then there's ONA. 
[01:29:30]  The Opie and Anthony Show.  You guys are an undisciplined child wielding ultimate power.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony Show.  In studio, Louis Black playing Caroline tonight through Sunday.  Here in New York City.  You like Disturb, Louis?  You like the band Disturb?  Are you kidding?  It's perfect.  You know, that's sad because they get money for something that I hear inside my head.  You're hearing that all the time. 
[01:30:00]  All the time.  24 hours a day, Louis hears Disturb in his head.  It's 24-7, and then somebody came out with a record.  Who knew you could record it?  Do you listen to rock music, Louis?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah?  Yeah, anything.  I listen to anything.  What band are you into?  I was listening to...  Who the hell was I listening to today?  Rusted Root is not really rock, though.  A lot of drums.  Rusted Root.  A lot of drums.  Yeah.  A lot of drums.  Rusted Root.  A lot of drums.  Drums.  Fish.  You like fish?  I don't like knish.  No.  You don't like fish? 
[01:30:30]  No, I don't like knish.  I listen to anything.  Yeah.  But I don't...  I do.  I'm serious.  I listen to practically anything.  The only thing I really have trouble with is country and Norton's two albums.  Those were odd.  He only listens to two albums.  Norton listens to everything Ozzy.  As long as Ozzy's in it.  Everything Ozzy.  It's good.  Do you even like the 80s Ozzy?  Of course I do.  He survives glam metal.  With the big puppy hair and everything.  Yeah, he looks a little like Bette Midler in the Shot in the Dark video, but so what?  He survives glam metal. 
[01:31:00]  He survives grunge.  How many guys do that?  He certainly did.  He's God.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Do you know Megan from Comedy Central?  Do I?  Yeah.  No, what is she?  Megan, what's up?  Hello.  What's up, Megan?  I'm looking for the person who writes the songs for the Opie and Anthony show, The Interstitials.  That make the whole world sing.  Write what songs?  The little ins and outs. 
[01:31:30]  Do you actually work for Comedy Central?  I actually do.  So why...  This explains it.  Oh, my God.  All right.  I thought for a second that she had some kind of a mental problem, but...  Let's go with it, though.  Why would you need to know that?  Because we want to talk to them about writing songs for our show.  What's your show?  It's a new show that'll be on in July.  Oh.  Oh, you like the music we play in and out of breaks?  Exactly.  And you want that person to write stuff for your show? 
[01:32:00]  Right.  Holy ass.  But wait a minute.  It's music.  It's music that's out there.  It's today's music.  It's today's music.  You mean like the last song that was just on?  Well, I'm not listening right now, actually.  It's a guy named Ziggy who writes most of it.  Megan, you're not for real, are you?  I am.  We're playing stuff like Godsmack and Disturbed and everything.  And Stone Temple Pilots and Tool.  No.  Aren't there little interstitial songs that are on?  What? 
[01:32:30]  Like little...  Interstitial songs?  What show is going on in July?  Yeah.  What show?  It's all about puppets.  It's all about puppets.  That's all you need to know.  That's all you need to know.  Puppets or marionettes?  Puppets never funny.  Never.  Puppets for all.  Puppets are never funny.  I couldn't get a show on the air.  They are.  I couldn't get a show on the air.  I couldn't get a show on the air.  And there's going to be puppets. 
[01:33:00]  Puppets only funny if a crackhead's worth it.  And once again, I wonder...  Puppets.  Wait, wait, wait.  Puppets are funny.  Well, what difference does it make?  No, man.  That'll be the thing that'll turn the station around.  I know.  Go ahead, Jim.  Puppets are always funny when you see a little dirty puppet laying somewhere and a small cut arm sticking out of it.  Someone's little arm was cut off while having fun with this puppet.  That's always fun.  Megan...  I want to smack your head on the corner of a porcelain sink. 
[01:33:30]  Megan, the guy that does all the In-N-Out music for our show...  Right.  ...Big Chocolate.  His name's Big Chocolate?  Yeah, we'll give you his number.  Great.  Hold on.  Thank you.  All right.  Someone give Megan Big Chocolate's phone number.  Rick, give Megan the phone number of musical genius Big Chocolate.  You don't have to get everything on this show, Lewis.  Gee, I hope he calls her.  You think he will?  He's very busy.  He's good, though, man. 
[01:34:00]  I like him.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Man, that's a stupid lady.  Puppets.  All right.  Lewis, you had something else you wanted to tell before you run out of here, right?  Before I go to do this show tonight, the last great heckle I had, the underbelly of what's going on in this war,  is I'm talking about stuff at the end of my act, and it's really like, it's not Republican or Democrat.  It's about having a sense of humor, right?  So then the guy goes, you don't get it, man.  It's God and country. 
[01:34:30]  And I said, yeah, but, you know, it's nice, you know, to have a sense of humor in that mix so we don't get lost.  And he goes, you don't get it.  It's a religious war, and we have the right God.  Oh, that's right.  Isn't that?  That's right, man.  What do you say?  I literally, it was the first time I almost took in so much air on a, and I almost died.  The audience, literally, it was like, Jerry, it was beyond anything I'd ever heard an audience do.  Lewis, it's true, though.  Our invisible man is more powerful than the very invisible man, yes. 
[01:35:00]  I said that that was the end of our 60-minute show this week.  Yeah.  Thank you.  Good night on that note.  I just want to move as far, I've moved all the way over to the right.  I mean, he just looked.  Leave them shell-shocked.  I've never heard anybody, anyone say, you know, I've never heard that spoken in public.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's something usually behind closed doors.  Yeah, or you see it in a documentary, and you go, oh, boy, I hope I never run into those people.  And now I do.  Right in front of you.  That's why we're effed as a world, though, man. 
[01:35:30]  Yeah, that is scary.  Our God, let's see, is the right God.  Is the right God.  All right.  Yeah.  Well, there you go.  Yep.  He wins in Vegas.  He wins in Vegas.  I'm going to have to hit it, guys.  Lois.  It's been a slice, but I'm coming back next week because I'm off.  So, ha, ha, ha.  Come on.  We'll all be coming by.  You don't want to hang with the porn star?  I'd love to, but, you know, I have got to, you know, got to go make whatever it is I do.  Just because your head writer just called in, now you have to leave all of a sudden? 
[01:36:00]  Megan's your head writer, right?  Yeah, my head writer.  Yeah, Megan.  Your head writer.  Oh, yeah, boy, I can't wait for that.  Puppets.  Puppets.  It's all about puppets.  They'll have that dildo on the air.  The puppet will wear the dildo.  The little chick dildo on the puppet.  Take care, guys.  Thanks a lot.  Lewis Black.  There he goes.  Thanks, man.  Thank you.  Lewis never leaves during the break.  I know.  Well, Lewis never leaves during the break.  He usually waits to commercial.  What did we do?  Look at this.  There he goes.  What do you think?  You're on Johnny Carson? 
[01:36:30]  Damn it.  Yeah.  See you later.  Who used to leave Carson?  Bob Hope could get up and leave.  Yeah, I got to get you playing out in Vegas.  We're opening it to Zara.  Yeah.  I just don't want to miss the car.  He would go.  What's his name?  Jimmy Stewart.  He could leave.  What was it?  Bob, of course, what's it?  Frank Sinatra.  He'd walk out in the middle of someone else's.  They're not leaving.  No way.  You are up in those ranks.  You can leave.  Yeah.  Me and Jimmy Stewart. 
[01:37:00]  Most of the dead guys.  Right.  Right.  You are like a dead guy.  Have fun with your top Saturday.  The little Hanukkah thing in here.  Dreadle, dreidel, dreidel top thing.  All right.  All right.  Lewis, thanks, man.  All right.  There he goes.  Our buddy, our pal, Lewis Black from The Daily Show on Comedy Central.  That's a tough act to follow, you guys.  Hey, Jay Moore, what's going on?  Jay Moore.  Wow.  Lewis, you got a porn star in there?  Terry.  Terry Weigel.  Weigel.  Yeah, she screamed so loud, I'd turn it off. 
[01:37:30]  She's going to host the porn star.  The porn awards.  The porn awards?  Is Otto and George going to be there?  I don't know.  Oh, forget all that.  How are you guys?  Doing well.  Very good.  How was fun today, man?  How was Hofstra last night?  Standing O, baby.  Mike DiNicola got one, and I didn't.  Mike DiNicola got a standing O.  No, I'm kidding.  Come on.  Mike's been rocking, man.  No, Mike rocks.  I wasn't saying I'm kidding about me not getting one.  Right.  That's what I was saying.  Mike's fine.  I was at jet camp today.  Boomer's going to come on, man.  It's just a matter of time.  I talked to him today. 
[01:38:00]  Good.  He does not remember getting punched in the face.  I know.  That has gotten back to us already.  He doesn't remember Anthony breaking his arm, punching Boomer, and his fat head.  This is what killed me.  He goes, what's Anthony's last name?  I go, these are like my best friends.  He goes, what's Anthony's last name?  I don't know.  I drew a blank.  I know it's Camille, but I'm looking at this Boomer's big, fat steroid head.  What's this guy's name?  Jones.  Star.  Oh, wow.  You foul on Aerosmith. 
[01:38:30]  Anthony does not lie about stuff like that.  No, I said, these are not guys that would make it up.  That's right.  I'll fill it in.  He goes, yeah, I think I did that show.  I go, no, you always almost do it, and you bail out at the last second, and that's Bush.  Boomer.  So I got in him.  Norman.  And John Hall got mad at me today because I made a weed reference to him, and Herman Edwards  is in the room.  We just need a win in December.  This is what happened.  John Hall's getting treatment on his back.  He's fine.  He's just getting loosened up, and they're putting cream all over his back. 
[01:39:00]  And I go, John, whenever they're rubbing on your back, don't smoke it.  Oh, God damn.  And Herman's just, like, rolling around.  He's cool.  It's like hanging out, like, with your drunk uncle.  He's just everywhere.  He's the best.  Right on.  But he's, like, cool.  And then I leave, and then now Herman leaves, and John Hall's got, like, he's dragging his  lip on the ground.  I go, what's the matter?  He goes, man, I'm trying to get away from that image.  I'm trying to build a career here.  And you're doing weed references, and they're in the effing head coaches.  And I go, wow, you know what?  You're right.  I'm sorry.  You got yelled at.  No sense of humor, right, Jay?  No, he's got a sense of humor, but he, you know, he used to wear a bag of hemp around 
[01:39:30]  his neck.  Let's be honest.  Right.  He goes, a Martian.  Right, right.  Denver.  Come on.  So then I'm like, I tell him, though, I'm a man about it.  I go, you know what, John?  You're absolutely correct, and I'm sorry.  I really crossed the line, and that's if I could change something about myself, that's  what I wish it was, because I do it from time to time, and I'm really embarrassed.  He goes, I don't want you to be embarrassed.  I go, well, then, can we just have a clean slate?  He goes, yeah.  I leave, like, an hour later, I'm interviewing her.  And I come back out, and it's still on the ground.  I go, what's the matter?  He goes, I'm still pissed off.  I'm like, what the hell? 
[01:40:00]  You're a kicker.  He didn't want to let it go.  But it's like, you know, it's not like Mo Lewis is mad at you.  Kicker, very important on a team.  I know.  And John Hall, you know what, as far as kickers go, that's one big unit, man.  They got the one bar on their helmet.  It looks cute.  John Hall's a big, you don't, John Hall's the white guy you don't want to see in the  holding cell.  Trust me.  All right.  What's the matter?  Well, we got to play our Earl tribute.  We have a tribute to Earl.  Oh, good.  Yeah, he needs one.  Yeah, you know what, it's better you play the tribute, because man, is he dull. 
[01:40:30]  You don't want to just play me.  Norton, did you listen to that yesterday when you were in your basement sucking on a  diesel battery?  No, I didn't.  Yeah, Earl was pretty boring yesterday.  Dude, if you can't be interesting in the emergency room, chances are you're not interesting.  And what's going on in there?  Nothing.  He lost a lot of blood, though.  He's not thinking right.  He feels great.  He doesn't have the presence of mind to ask for drugs, mind-altering substances.  Look, you know you're boring if you're in the emergency room.  What's going on?  Nothing.  Yeah, he's in ICU. 
[01:41:00]  What about the guy next to you?  Oh, yeah, he died yesterday.  Well, you might want to open with that, bro.  It's interesting.  That is interesting.  Open with it.  Nothing.  I'm just sitting around.  And if you're in ICU, you've got to make believe something's hurting you, so you get  the advantage of being in an ICU.  Some drugs.  It's a Brian Regan joke.  You've got to moan louder.  Yeah.  The guy's just slaying me.  Anthony, I never heard a Bob Hope impression that was good, and I know you were just like  tossing it aside.  That was great.  Oh, thank you, John.  And I will never knock it.  Hey, where's Norton?  Right here.  Where's the Bob Hope respect? 
[01:41:30]  It's an oldie, but a goodie.  I happen to enjoy it very much.  Well, then tell your face.  Look, I don't need to grovel like you did in front of John Hall.  I nodded, I smiled, and I moved along.  Hey, you know what, Norton?  If you were in front of John Hall, I got odds that you'd grovel.  Supertoom, I would just...  No, I know, that's the thing.  Norton's got self...  I'd get a photo with him, and I'd leave him alone.  Yeah, but for you...  Yeah, I know, but that's how you are.  You're nice and easy, and I've got to push the envelope.  All right, then grovel and apologize for it.  Hey, you know why Grovel didn't apologize? 
[01:42:00]  Because he was right.  No, he wasn't.  The head coach is...  It's a black head coach.  He needs another pod head on his team.  Did you apologize to every audience member for every film you've ever done?  It's not the right thing.  You know what?  I'd say something witty back, but I just saw your movie, and it's actually great,  so I can't even make fun of it.  American Dummy?  Thank you.  Yeah, am I groveling now?  No, that was nice.  American Dummy, cult favorite.  Well, I will say that I didn't have much to do with that.  That was Adam and George's.  You had a spit cake.  And Brewers.  The spit cake is classic. 
[01:42:30]  Norton, hey, if you've never seen a spit cake, you don't have to go back to the old tapes.  Norton does it 101.  That was classic, Martin.  Do you mean with Lewis in Sidesplitters or American Sidesplitters?  Oh, Sidesplitters.  That's the one I saw.  Oh, Sidesplitters.  That was with Lewis.  Yeah, those are all...  I have to give out the web address for this so people can...  Go ahead, plug it.  Sidesplitters.  I don't have it with me.  An American Dummy that is hilarious.  I don't have it with me.  You put those on the internet and Yahoo and something will come up.  Well, yeah, I think we got links through foundrymusic.com.  Do we?  We have to get to the Earl Tribune. 
[01:43:00]  Yeah.  Okay, good.  Hey, Jay, Rascals, tomorrow night, two shows, all right?  You're going to be there, right?  Hell yeah.  All right.  You need anything special in the green room?  I know Anthony gets kind of pantied in a lot if he doesn't have the room temperature Gatorade.  Yeah, that's what I like.  You know what I liked last time I was in the green room at Rascals?  The coal?  The little...  Well, yeah, that's always pleasant, too.  But you know that old corny game, the nutshells?  Yeah.  You want the three nutshells with the P under it?  But there's a comedian that does it with Valium.  It's very...  Ah.  Very good. 
[01:43:30]  He's one of Kinnison's guys.  Very good twist on an old gag.  What's his name?  Mitch Walters?  Mitch Walters.  Mitch Walters, yeah.  He's one of Kinnison's guys, and he's always playing that, like...  Man, the guy's got a Valium.  He's like, follow the Percocet.  Oh, it's his average now.  What happened?  I'm like, what happened?  He does all these old corny tricks.  He's like, I'm going to a party.  You want to come with me?  He's like, I'm going to a meeting.  Maybe you should come with me.  I liked him.  He kept me entertained last time down there.  Yeah, that guy was cool.  God bless you guys, and the show last night was a lot of fun.  Dino rocked, and tonight, Rascal's going to be fun. 
[01:44:00]  Norton's got...  You've got to come down, Norton.  I can't.  I'm working, but I definitely would, man, if I wasn't working.  I can't.  Can't you quit?  I'll pay you more.  Jay, they're going to kill us.  We've got to get...  I'm sorry.  Go do your thing.  I love you guys.  All right.  We've got to get to you later, Jay.  Thanks.  Jay Moore, everyone.  All right, Anthony.  So, Black Girl.  Yeah, Black Girl in the hospital.  Bleeding ulcer, it seems.  He's got this two bleeding ulcers in his stomach.  He lost a lot of blood.  That's why he was in ICU.  They were pumping him full of brand new blood.  Hopefully, it's energetic blood.  We feel a little guilty because we agitated the poor boy. 
[01:44:30]  I know I did.  Hey, hey, watch that language.  You can't say boy.  Well, no.  Why?  Why?  It's a derogatory term.  I wasn't thinking that way, though.  The poor guy.  There you go.  Jesus.  Why?  Anthony, you know, we don't explain stuff for new markets anymore.  Yeah.  Because it wastes too much time.  No offense to the new markets.  They've just got to fill themselves in.  Yeah, but for the Earl thing, could you explain Black Earl within 15 seconds?  Black Earl's been here at this station in New York City forever. 
[01:45:00]  Forever.  For some reason, he doesn't do any work.  No one knows what he does, yet he keeps his job.  I think it has something to do with equal opportunity employment, but who knows?  He's still here.  But now he's in the hospital.  First time he's missed work in quite some time.  We don't know what he does.  We know it has something to do with CDs.  And any time we ask him to do something, whenever we ask him to do something, it takes forever,  and it never gets done right.  Right.  And he seems to be lazy.  All right.  So, Steve from foundrymusic.com, put this little thing together. 
[01:45:30]  Is this called Earl's Song?  This is, yeah.  It's a takeoff on Brian's song.  Ah, of course.  The trailer called Earl's Song.  So, let's go to the tape now, Anthony.  A-B-C.  And the wonderful world of Disney present an extraordinary production of the story of Earl Douglas.  Go f*** yourself, okay?  He had survived every format change at WNEW.  I'm the public service director.  But would he survive this tragic ordeal? 
[01:46:00]  Earl, are you okay?  What do you have on your chart?  I have ulcers.  Two of them.  No one knew that a stress-free job could be so deadly.  They took a camera, ran it down my throat, made a wonderful journey through my stomach.  Watch as Earl clings to life in the intensive care unit.  He's not responding.  He's just sitting there kicking his feet.  He looks like he's going to kill somebody.  I guarantee you someone will get injured and it won't be me.  With the public file in disarray, the staff of WNEW tries to cope. 
[01:46:30]  Who's going to sit in the back cubicle and do nothing all day?  Who's going to hang these pictures?  A token black guy.  He's gone.  Who knew Scott Muni would have outlived Earl?  Earl, the van, showed up for a sticker stop on time.  Wait, Earl's not here?  Hey, look, CDs. 
[01:47:00]  Watch as Earl faces struggles inside the studio and out.  Earl, I have a question for you.  Is it true that they wanted you to work harder so they're going to do a melanin extraction?  Next question.  Yeah.  If Earl's on the road to recovery, won't he get lost?  Tell me where I'm going.  From ABC television comes the triumphant true story of laziness, mediocrity, virginity, and internal bleeding.  Guess what?  No one cares.  Earl's song.  I love you, Earl Douglas.  Go f*** yourself, okay? 
[01:47:30]  Oh, wow.  Get well soon, pal.  Wow.  A little tribute.  Stay from foundrymusic.com.  That was nice.  I like that.  That was a nine-person assault on Earl.  That was creative input from everybody, almost.  Not hard to come up with ways to bash Earl.  No, it wasn't.  It wasn't.  The second everybody caught wind of it, it was like, oh, wait, you can say this, too.  Oh, you can say this about how he doesn't work and how lazy he is.  Yeah.  Poor guy.  I shouldn't beat him when he's down. 
[01:48:00]  Well, we should take a break so we can get Terry in here.  Mm-hmm.  We have foot doctors here.  Dr. Jackalone.  Yeah, that's his real name?  Yeah.  What?  His name is Dr. Jackalone?  Yeah, that's right.  Wow.  Let me see.  How does it spell?  He's a foot doctor.  Jack-alone?  Jack-alone.  Dr. Jackalone.  Right.  And Dr. Nestor.  Jackalone.  Nice.  Is Jackalone there?  Sally Kramer?  Jackalone.  Jackalone.  Dr. Jackalone. 
[01:48:30]  Sally Kramer?  I wonder if his partner is Dr. Cracker in the middle.  Jackalone.  And Dr. Nestor.  Joe Dudo.  Dr. Joe Dudo.  And Assistant Ed.  They're going to take a look at Patty's Hammer Toast.  You have a lot of moxie.  Come down here.  I guess this is the warm-up for tomorrow's show, which will be What the Hell is That?  What the Hell is That?  where we finally find out what Twato is.  All right.  Why don't we just step aside?  Step aside?  Hmm?  So maybe they'll hang out longer? 
[01:49:00]  Oh, is that it now?  Instead of saying, we'll be back?  We're going to just step aside.  I just think you go off on a...  You just go out mid-talking.  You know?  Really?  It's one of those things that you say something and then just hit the button and go right to it.  Oh, my God.  That reminds me.  Did I tell you what happened today, Anthony?  What?  The Opie and Anthony Show.  It's like listening to Corky and Cara Ann Quinlan.  Opie and Anthony.  I'd rather hear my penis in a place than listen to those two.  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:49:30]  Cake.  I like the cake.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Hi.  A couple phone numbers in the New York area.  877-692-1027.  Anywhere else.  866-277-4WOW.  Garrett, what's up?  Hey, I think they cut you out here in D.C.  Right as you're talking about what you're doing this weekend.  You idiot.  What happened?  I think they cut you out here in D.C. 
[01:50:00]  Did they go right to commercial?  Yeah.  Right as you were going into what you're going to do this weekend.  No.  When I said, uh...  What?  Remember?  Hey.  Hey, Ann.  But it wasn't about a weekend.  No, I don't know what it was.  That doesn't matter.  I think I have to tell you what happened to me today.  Yeah.  And then...  And what happened, Garrett?  And they just went into Redskins Radio.  Oh, my God.  So I started telling a story and they went right to commercial?  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  We're going to have to, uh, you know, set them straight down in D.C.  Yeah.  It was a great story, but, you know, it's going to take too long to retell. 
[01:50:30]  Maybe someday you'll get to hear it in its entirety.  All right.  Maybe when we're on vacation, we'll replay it.  It was one of the best stories I've ever told, I must say.  All right, Garrett.  Thank you.  Yep.  Stupid, stupid man.  I thought Megan was the stupidest person at all our show today.  Why haven't we heard from, uh, from Erin with the, uh, fungus in her mouth?  She's at the doctor.  No joke, eh?  Well, does she have a cell phone or something?  No.  Oh, no.  She's got a mouth full of pus. 
[01:51:00]  Jesus.  That's horrible.  Hey, can we get, uh, Terry in here?  Terry Weigel.  Hosting the, the porn awards.  Yeah.  Do we need, uh, bring in the foot doctors, too, or not yet?  No.  No, no.  Okay.  Plank foot's got to slide back over there.  Poor foot.  Foot gets no respect.  Honey!  Wow.  Terry!  Hey!  There she is.  Wow, look at you.  Beautiful.  Wow.  Ever since we got syndicated, we get fine-looking ladies in the studio. 
[01:51:30]  Yes.  Oh.  What's up, Terry?  We were just, uh, playing a little foosball.  Not much.  How are you guys?  Good.  Sorry to make you wait.  That's okay.  But you're, she's a good foosball player, aren't you?  Yeah.  Yeah, you're great, too, man.  She has an odd style, though.  She, uh, plays, uh, one of the handles with her mouth.  But she's good at it.  Well, she knows how to work that handle.  That was real good.  Come on.  It's all about fun now.  That's right.  Yeah.  So how's this for fun?  Oh, well, there she goes.  Oh, my goodness.  Look at that.  That's fun. 
[01:52:00]  Now, is that fun?  You know, no, I like this.  No coaxing.  No begging.  She just flops those babies right out.  Now she's T-F-ing the microphone.  I brought a pair of panties for you guys.  Oh, you did?  She gets to have them.  Let's see.  Norton loves them.  Norton.  Norton.  Oh, my God.  My buddy over here.  Yeah.  You remember Jim Norton.  She's completely naked.  Yeah.  There she is.  We didn't have to ask her.  I remember him.  We know each other very well.  Is he packing? 
[01:52:30]  Yeah.  You couldn't really tell that day.  I was packing like a half.  I was nervous.  Oh, yeah.  You were 50% power.  He was sweet, though.  I really liked you.  She's got a little gold chain around her.  She is completely wood floor there.  She takes it right down to the quick.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Every day.  What do you think?  Beautiful.  Do you like that?  Yeah.  Do a little slow turn so we can see that ass.  Wow.  Look at that.  Perfect.  There you go.  Norton, what do you think?  You're right there.  You're right there.  Perfect.  He knows.  Perfect. 
[01:53:00]  Oh.  She just puts Norton's.  We know each other real well.  Norton's hand right on her breast there.  That's something.  She's perfect.  There you go.  You're like, mommy.  Mommy.  Mommy.  So now you're going to host the porn awards.  The adult awards.  Right.  Right.  Whatever they call it.  January 6th.  I guess it's the 8th or the 9th.  Yeah.  In Vegas.  Now, what's that?  He's saying something.  Your slong is how big?  Oh, the 11th.  The 11th. 
[01:53:30]  It's that big?  He's holding two fingers up very close together.  I thought he had a problem.  It's that little?  He meant on the 11th.  Okay.  The 11th.  The 11th.  Now, you've done a few of these videos yourself?  Uh-huh.  I've done about 50.  Have you won any awards?  No.  Now, why didn't you?  What were you holding back?  What did other people do that you didn't do that you're not trying hard enough?  Yeah.  What's the matter?  No.  It's just I'm real wild, my style.  I scream a lot and stuff.  You do?  And they don't like that.  Yeah, I'm a screamer.  They don't? 
[01:54:00]  What do they like?  No, they like, I guess, play acting.  Play acting.  Look, when you give away the best anal.  Oh, baby.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And I just let go, so.  All right.  What do you mean?  Well, let's get an example of her letting go.  Yeah, what does that sound like?  Without the F's and the F's and the F's?  No, but I'd have to do something.  Well, uh, Norton's right there next to you.  No, you can do whatever you want to, uh, prep, uh...  My husband is here. 
[01:54:30]  Let's, uh...  He doesn't care.  Prep whatever you do.  Hold on, you're one of these porn stars that has the husband that doesn't care?  He don't care.  He's my idol.  No.  He doesn't.  That amazes me every time.  Remember?  Come on.  Show them.  Well, go ahead.  Come on.  Then have the husband throw her a bang in and then she's moan over the, uh...  Who do we have in where...  Who's shy today?  ...where the porn star wanted to F all of us and the guy that was filming the whole thing...  Animal.  Animal.  Oh.  The guy that was filming the whole thing was her husband.  And I'm like, you don't mind that she wants to F all of us in front of you? 
[01:55:00]  No, I don't care.  She does it all the time.  Remember that one she was in where she was the librarian and she had the big glasses on  and the glasses ended up looking like strudel icing was smeared all over them and she cleaned  them off with her tongue?  There was some of that bukkake.  Little little bukkake.  Ah, bukkake.  Ah, bukkake.  Ah, bukkake.  Yeah.  So, wow, I can't believe you've never won, uh, one of the awards though.  No.  We want, we want her to lose her mind.  So what are we going to do here?  Yeah, that would sound great. 
[01:55:30]  I don't know.  The husband doesn't want to do it.  Do you do any solo, uh, any solo action where you can, uh, you can do something like  that?  Yeah, well, you don't have to describe anything.  Could Norton get involved or...  I'll just watch.  I don't know.  She's too hot.  I'm too intimidated.  Too hot.  We have toys.  We have toys.  Oh, you got a toy?  I don't have a toy, but...  What?  I could, um...  Intern?  Yeah.  But our husband's here.  Stinky, you want in?  Huh?  Huh?  Come to Club Stinky, located in the stairwell. 
[01:56:00]  What about Stinky?  Is that Stinky?  Yeah.  He doesn't stink, though.  He looks shy.  He's really shy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  No?  What?  I don't even know what we're talking about.  I don't either, to tell you the truth.  She needs...  Having fun.  She needs somebody to whip her up into a frenzy so she can give us an example of what she sounds  like on some of her films.  She can't...  Uh-oh.  He's walking away.  She could do it alone.  No.  Is it okay to...  Get a toy.  Is it okay to... 
[01:56:30]  Come on, Ma.  Come on.  Okay.  Okay.  Wait.  He's going to do something.  He's going to do something.  Here we go.  We got him.  We got him.  Okay.  He's going to do something.  Here we go.  All right.  Here comes the hubby.  Don't describe what he's doing.  Oh, yeah.  And no foul language.  Okay.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Right there.  Right there.  Right there.  There's a fake orgasm.  Oh, my God.  It's almost there.  Oh, my God.  Okay.  It's almost there. 
[01:57:00]  Oh, my God.  Don't stop.  Wait, wait.  I'm not done.  Wow.  Now, that's an actress, Anthony.  Look at that.  Wow.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Holy Jesus Christ.  Oh, wow.  Hey.  Sorry, I needed that.  Let me tell you something. 
[01:57:30]  That is why our boys are over there in Afghanistan right now.  That is what we are fighting for, people.  Amazing.  That obviously was fake, Anthony.  Oh, of course, Opie.  Never happens that quickly.  We know that.  Right?  Okay.  Terrific.  Ixnay.  That was something.  Wow.  Well, you know something?  By judging by that, you should have won some awards, I think.  Well.  You're open to everything in the movies? 
[01:58:00]  You do it all?  I don't do it all.  You don't do that?  It's nothing.  Isn't there more money for that?  No.  You know?  Do you save that for your hubby, or you just did so against it?  No, I just don't like it.  Prude.  I'm very orgasmic.  That's good.  I don't really need right now to go in that direction.  I don't.  Bravo.  Wow.  But I like to watch.  Look, you're packing, Norton.  That's great.  No, Norton's packing.  He's grabbing himself.  He's just my idol.  He just walks right over, takes care of business. 
[01:58:30]  I'll tell you, if it's any consolation, you won the queen of my spank bubble award.  Oh, yeah.  She made the Rolodex before she took off her clothes.  Hi.  How are you?  Ka-ching.  All right.  Piled away to be brought up at some later occasion.  Under T and W.  Hey, Terry, were you really in Loads of Fun 3?  No.  I don't know what that is.  Loads of Fun 3?  Well, Cyril writes, will you please tell Terry that I loved her in Loads of Fun number 3?  Well, let's jump in Jay of Ed Powers. 
[01:59:00]  Oh, maybe yes.  Okay.  Ed Powers.  They change the titles of some of these movies.  Yeah, they do.  They make compilations and God knows.  Loads of Fun.  20 out of one video.  So, yeah.  Yes, I was.  I wonder what they mean by Loads of Fun, Opie.  You know, Matt from Promotions wants in.  Oh, yeah?  Where is Matt?  Get Matt in here.  Where the hell is he?  I don't know.  Is it you?  Are you Matt?  Yeah.  Matt.  I didn't see you back there.  Oh, I played with him. 
[01:59:30]  What do you mean?  Foosball or something else?  Yeah, I played foosball.  He's my partner.  We won twice.  But Matt, foosball.  Now I wanted him, but I think the husband took care of it.  And then he was talking to one of the girls out there, and we wanted to see his thing,  but he wouldn't show it to us, so.  Yeah.  But he wants to be a point.  Wouldn't show you a little foosball man?  He looks like the guy that raped Roller Girl on the limo.  Wow.  And let's reenact the scene.  Do we have any of the toys? 
[02:00:00]  Did you bring any of those?  I don't know what Stinky did with all our toys.  Took him home.  Stinky, what'd you do with the toys?  Look, he's just flabbergasted.  Stinky.  He took them home.  Yeah.  Smuggled them on his person.  And he ate them.  I want to see something happen with Terry and Stinky, because Stinky is, like, incredibly shy.  He won't do anything.  No way.  No, no, no?  Mm-mm.  All right.  No way. 
[02:00:30]  Well, that's cool.  I like porn stars, man.  That's great.  Thank you.  And I like ones with a little bit of restraint, that she held back the A for a while.  That's good.  I like that.  I have a new respect for you that you didn't give in to the A like that.  Thank you.  Let's go to Kevin.  Kevin, what's up?  Hey, how you guys doing?  All right.  What?  You guys almost made me back in this car, man, listening to this girl.  Isn't she a great actress, Kevin?  Wow.  I wish my girl sounded like that.  You like the screamers?  Oh, man.  I mean, that's what makes it all fun, right? 
[02:01:00]  Yeah.  I'd bang my grandmother if she sounded like that.  Oh, stop it.  She doesn't, and you have.  You guys rock, man.  You might be able to scream if you took the pillow off of me.  Nitro-glycerin.  Shh.  Shh.  Shh.  Shh.  Shh.  Shh.  Shh.  Shh.  Tim, what's up?  What's going on, guys?  She sounds like a phone girl.  Maybe it's time to break the glass on the wiffle ball bat, see if she can break that record.  Oh, God damn.  What's that?  That's a good one, guys.  You know what? 
[02:01:30]  Stinky's in charge of that.  We should have Stinky come in and explain it to her.  Stinky, yeah, I usually explain it, but we'll have Stinky.  Stinky.  We need to look at Stinky's confused face again, crinkle, crinkle.  Watch his confused little feet come in the door.  He's checking the closet for sex toys.  Huh?  He's checking the closet for some seconds.  Oh, that's too bad.  Maybe I'll present you with the idea that we have.  We've done this quite a few times.  It's called the Wiffle Ball Bat Challenge.  Right.  We have a wiffle ball bat in the back.  It's in a glass case.  Right.  It's only used with condoms, so it's safe wiffle ball batting. 
[02:02:00]  Oh, God.  And there have been various girls that have come in here that we feel, not every girl,  just girls that we feel have that special talent to take the Wiffle Ball Bat Challenge.  There are notches written on this Wiffle Ball Bat with a magic marker,  and little names appear next to the notches.  And the furthest distance from either end of the Wiffle Ball Bat to the center,  the closest you get to the center, will win at the end of the year.  And now we're looking at, you know, a couple of weeks away. 
[02:02:30]  Oh, my God.  If you would be up for the Wiffle Ball Bat Challenge.  We have plenty of condoms.  We have a smooth, silky lubricant.  Okay.  And that's all we need to say to describe this.  You can use this in either place, but we know how you feel about the other place.  So we won't even offer that.  But will you take it?  God damn.  I love it. 
[02:03:00]  Stinky, don't get the bat.  Stinky, bring the bat.  That's great.  Wait until you see it come in.  It's like, it's moving.  Yeah, because he marches it around the studio.  Who so far is the challenger of this event?  Who's in the lead?  I don't think Animal's in the lead.  No?  I think it was some chubby girl from Jersey.  To tell you the truth.  A real underdog.  Wow.  But she went down for the count on that one. 
[02:03:30]  And she did a great job.  But I'm willing to say.  Now, have you had many larger gentlemen that you've done movies with?  Yeah, I've had a couple.  The one that, what was his name, Merle?  Lexington Steel.  Yeah.  You're asking your husband?  Yeah, I forget.  What's his name?  What was the guy's name?  Lexington Steel.  Lexington Steel.  He was huge.  I kind of got ripped a little bit.  You did, did you?  Yeah, I'm pretty small.  Norton knows about that.  Lex throws you down and teaches you a lesson. 
[02:04:00]  I got on his bad side.  You ever have an African gentleman?  Yeah.  Oh, really?  Big?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's Lexington.  Lexington's a black guy.  See?  I don't know my black porn stars.  Damn me to hell.  Here it is.  Look at the bat.  There it is.  Look at the, it's almost like the Olympic torch is being brought in.  In a glass case and everything, isn't it?  What's wrong?  And my cousin's listening, too. 
[02:04:30]  That's okay.  Hi, Donnie.  All right.  Now, uh...  All my relatives live in New Jersey.  Could you show her the record-setting mark so far, and let's get your feel on this.  You think you're going to be able to, um...  Don't smear it.  ...to beat this.  There's the mark.  Why is the husband laughing?  And it was from the handle inch.  I thought that was from the other end.  You know that answer. 
[02:05:00]  That's funny.  No, I don't think I can beat that, but I'll try.  Give it a try, and, uh...  So give it the all-American try, right?  Yeah.  Because I think at the end of the year, also, we're going to auction off the bat for charity.  We'll put it on eBay.  Wow.  There, Stinky rolling on the...  Well, Stinky prepares.  Uh, I want to know how, uh, Terry met her husband.  Um, he was in, um, Florida in a band.  He was a bass player.  And, uh, he took no for an answer the first day he got me. 
[02:05:30]  And he was the second guy I was ever with.  Really?  Yeah.  Who was the first guy?  Some Italian dude.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Wow.  So you're the second guy she was ever with?  And now it's like hundreds.  How did you get into, uh, how did you get into the industry?  And he didn't mind when you went into the industry?  Um, no, because we kind of did it together.  Yeah.  When I did the Playboy thing, I was a Playboy center phone.  Mm-hmm.  And then the channel was doing, um, Fantasies. 
[02:06:00]  And at the same time, we were doing Hardcore.  So him and I were already doing them.  Those are always good.  Like the old Playboy channel, uh, spanked you.  You'd spank to that one at night.  Right.  So that's how it kind of started.  We said, what the hell is he doing?  He's putting on, uh, well, it's all for the safety.  Very clinical.  Of the, uh, ladies.  And now some lube is being applied.  All right, Stinky.  Jesus Christ.  These are dry, so.  Cool.  I'm going to put on a pair of these.  He's putting on a pair of gloves.  They look cool.  Those are the same gloves he opens the mail with, by the way. 
[02:06:30]  There you go.  Oh, gee, thanks.  And now, would you like, uh, your hubby to, uh, help you out on this one?  We've noticed that a couple of different...  Would it help me?  If you're at a different, um, uh, position, it's, uh...  Yeah, what's, uh...  Different angle?  I believe the girl that set the record tried it one way and said it wasn't working.  Then she tried it another way, uh, where she actually couldn't see the end of the back.  I'm just going to go to where it feels good, okay, and then...  There you go.  I'm not in it to win. 
[02:07:00]  At this point, let's not describe what's going on, right?  Can I, wait a minute, have a little bit of that stuff first?  Yeah, there you go.  Very good.  Put it in her gloved hands.  This is just wonderful that you're taking the Whiffle Ball Bat Challenge.  Yeah, a lot of it.  We love it.  Yeah, she is squeezing a whole bunch out.  Like, one of those ones that you really play with out on the field this big.  Oh, the big fat ones?  No.  I was getting scared.  I'm like, oh, I don't know.  Oh, my God, we're not crazy.  All right.  Everything is, uh, everything is prepped, let's just say.  Leave it at that.  And now her husband is helping her, uh, to try to set a record. 
[02:07:30]  She says she's not in it to set the record.  She just wants to participate.  That's kind of nice.  That is nice, eh?  Okay.  That's nice.  It's not all about awards, you know?  Norton, what's going on over there?  Oh.  I wish I was yellow.  All right.  Well, uh, things are going quite nicely.  Very slow going, but that's okay.  Okay, that's about where it hurts.  Wow, really?  All right.  Put your stinky, get in there.  Look at where my stomach is.  Put your finger there, stinky.  Okay. 
[02:08:00]  Or anybody, really.  Just make sure you mark exactly where that was.  Okay.  Very good.  Is that a fair mark, Terry?  Yeah, I think so.  It was, um, between, uh...  Hey, look at that.  Yeah, it's not bad.  Hey, that's not bad at all.  Nope.  I like the slow, steady approach they use.  Yeah, I like that, too.  Yeah, that was good.  That was nice.  There's some room for improvement, Anthony.  Very good.  Very good.  Pinky, where does that end up?  Let me see.  Right there.  Okay.  Very good. 
[02:08:30]  That's good.  What place is she in overall?  Second, I think.  Third?  It is easily four past six.  Oh, my God.  That's all right.  Okay.  Yeah.  Just the point I took it.  That's right.  Exactly.  You try it, Stinky.  Let's see where you place.  Right.  You know what makes it easier going and further going?  A second bat over the head.  Actually, then you could set the record. 
[02:09:00]  It's the Louisville Slugger in the back.  There you go, Stinky.  Mark that.  Yeah, bravo.  We love when girls are willing to take the whiffle ball bat challenge.  Thank you.  So great.  You did a cool porn star.  So how bad was that?  What was her name?  The one that wouldn't take over top for the cops that were here?  Oh, it was ridiculous.  They were voicing some Japanese anime porn.  I checked out that stuff.  It sucked.  Oh, Asia?  Oh, she's like that.  I don't know what it is.  It was Asia.  All you hear in those movies.  Asia's very shy.  Those movies are this. 
[02:09:30]  She's so beautiful.  Oh, stop.  What are you doing?  Oh, she's good, though.  The screaming little animated Chinese woman.  I like her touch.  She's got a great touch.  Does she?  Yeah, she really does.  She gave us nothing on this radio show.  Nothing.  Sorry.  I hear that.  Yeah.  You come right in.  The clothes off.  You're willing to take the whiffle ball bat challenge, and you gave us some great audio  candy for the listeners out there.  Bravo.  Yes.  Thank you.  You are welcome back anytime. 
[02:10:00]  Hello.  Nick, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  I've got to tell you, Terry is definitely a team player.  She's unbelievable.  Thank you.  Years ago, I was in Florida working for a lighting company, and she was there checking  out our products, and she happened to be friendly with one of the guys that worked in  the company, and she got to get world treats in the parking lot.  What?  All the guys in your company?  Dave?  Just one. 
[02:10:30]  Hey, no names.  Okay.  Oh, the married guy.  Unbelievable.  And the husband is over here like, oh.  And he was right there.  He should shoot the name out.  No, Terry's husband is like, oh, what a cute little story.  I'm like, he's the biggest fan.  Huh?  I got his wife.  He got his wife.  You got his wife?  Oh, my God.  So don't worry about the names.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  Wow.  Bravo.  Well, we want to thank Terry Weigel for stopping by.  Thank you so much.  Can we just give a plug if we could?  Of course. 
[02:11:00]  Whatever you want to plug.  Give a plug, whatever you want.  Elite-entertainment.com, and also my website, which is totallyterry.com or terryweigel.com.  I have 18 Boyer cameras in my house, 24 hours a day, seven days a week for the last two years.  Wow.  And you got every angle and stuff.  So when I'm home, you get to see.  You got the one in the shower?  Yeah, shower cam.  Those are always good.  I like when you girls are on the show.  Yeah, I got one that bounces off the mirror.  Yeah.  From the toilet.  The shower cams are great.  I like when the girls are in there, and I like when they put the leg up to shave.  Yeah.  And I like when you wash right down there. 
[02:11:30]  Yeah, that's what we do.  Oh, God, goodness.  The camera's like right there.  Yeah, and they're just the hands there, and they're soaping up like crazy.  Looks like a mad dog with tooth decay.  But is there a warning?  Love it.  Is there a warning if you're not home, though?  Because you might turn it on and see Merle reading the paper, taking a dump.  Because you guys live together.  Is there a warning that terry was away?  No, it is kind of funny, though, because he works in the computer room,  and he's got this crotch cam so that when I do shows in the computer, 
[02:12:00]  it's underneath the keyboard that pulls out.  Oh, so you can see right there.  So sometimes when he gets up in the morning to program or read the e-mail, he's naked.  Uh-oh.  So you're getting a face full of schlong.  She's the schlong cam.  There you go.  I like this.  I like this one.  She's all right.  That's good.  Who put on the Loch Ness Monster cam?  Guys, just one second.  Yes.  Really important.  For the next three days, terry is in town meeting all her fans one-on-one.  Oh.  Yeah, you can go to our website, Elite-Entertainment.com. 
[02:12:30]  What does one-on-one mean?  Private one-on-one.  Just her and her fans.  Oh, my God.  Jesus Christ.  You can go to our website at Elite-Entertainment.com.  Call us up.  These poor stars getting a little too interactive.  One-on-one.  Let me tell you.  You and Terry.  You are not going to get a one-on-one with a girl of this caliber.  I'll tell you that.  Are you meeting people one-on-one?  Yeah.  Nice.  Look at Norton.  Norton's legs are crossed because he doesn't want to show that he's so excited right now.  Norton can't even stand. 
[02:13:00]  Norton's running for a computer right now.  She's so awesome.  You really are.  Yeah, great job.  Thank you so much.  Thank you so much for having us.  Thank you.  You guys were fun.  It was a lot of fun.  Are you going to come back and see us?  Thank you.  I'd love to.  Yeah, you can come back because you're cool.  Thank you.  What?  What?  I'll bring you all the adult video talent.  You can have one.  Oh, but we like them cool like this.  Yeah, we just want to serve.  There's some sticks in the mud.  You know what I mean?  Thank you.  She is definitely cool and hot.  Thank you guys so much.  You guys were a lot of fun.  It was...  Thank you.  We were waiting and playing with you.  There you go.  I played with you. 
[02:13:30]  Foosball.  In case you're listening at home.  I've got to give kisses all of my buddy over here.  All right.  Anthony, let's hear it for Terry Weigel.  Yes.  Bravo.  Thank you.  You know what we do here?  Absolutely nothing.  That's wonderful, isn't it?  You'll be an Anthony show.  Hey, before I do this read,  I don't even know what it's for.  Can I have a Sam Adams?  Oh, Anthony.  Can I have a Sam before we do this commercial here for some product?  This is for Sam Adams.  I need a...  What?  Oh, yeah. 
[02:14:00]  What a coincidence.  See, I was just saying how much I love Sam Adams.  You might want to wash the bottle down, though.  Oh, why?  Was something being used now?  No, I'm just kidding.  Jesus Christ.  Hey, it's the holiday season.  It's the season of giving.  Sam Adams Winter Classics.  The perfect holiday gift.  One size fits all.  Treat yourself and others.  Here's what it is.  Six gold medal winning lagers and L's.  It's got the old Fezzerwig and Cranberry Lambic,  and they're only available in this six gold medal winning six pack.  It's a great gift.  You know, around the holidays, you're kicking around. 
[02:14:30]  Maybe you wake up Christmas morning,  and you want to calm down that hangover from Christmas Eve.  Pop yourself an old Fezziwig.  There it is.  Great gift of Sam Adams.  The gift of beer.  That Jim Cook, what a genius.  We love it here.  You're going to love it at home.  It's Sam Adams.  The station for sports guys,  Don and Mike,  Opie and Anthony,  and Ron and Fez is  this station.  1027 WNEW.  New York.  I don't know what you're playing, I do. 
[02:15:00]  Oh, yeah.  Remember that?  Remember that voice?  Want to thank Terry Weigel for stopping by, Anthony.  Who was that shit on that song?  Oh, my God.  I don't know.  Someone will know it out there.  Because that always was like the hottest thing, man.  When this song first came out,  the original version.  I hope all the cities did not dump out of Terry Weigel 
[02:15:30]  doing that fake orgasm acting thing.  Looks like most of the stations carried it, Anthony.  I think so.  Nothing wrong with that.  West Coast Dave writes from San Francisco.  Oh, yeah.  We heard it out here, guys.  Sounds like my neighbors when the welfare checks arrive.  All right, we're running on a show.  We got a couple doctors that we have to bring in.  They're going to diagnose Stark or Patty as we, I guess,  start up the what the hell is that?  Yeah, it's sort of a shoot off of it because tomorrow's the big day, 
[02:16:00]  but we know what it is that Patty has.  It's just these doctors are going to see if they can remedy it.  And are they going to clip her toenails, I hear?  They're going to clip her toenails live on the show today.  She says that she can't clip her toenails.  She came to cut your toenails.  Because it hurts me to do it.  It's very painful, but I have good hygiene.  These doctors could be saving a life.  Who's the next person that sucks on her toe?  That's what I'm saying.  Poor Aaron.  While Rick gets all the doctors and Stark or Patty set up in the studio, 
[02:16:30]  we have another bum, I mean homeless guy,  homeless guy that will be joining us for the homeless shopping spree next Tuesday, Anthony.  Yes.  His name, we were talking about him earlier.  How you doing?  Sperm!  Hey, Sperm, how you doing, man?  Hey, my friend Keith told me about shopping at the mall and stuff.  Yeah, well, we're helping you, sir.  Yes.  Now, it's a great Christmas thing.  We're going to give you guys some cash.  You're going to go shopping at a very exclusive mall.  How do you feel about that? 
[02:17:00]  I feel great.  And how long have you been on the street?  I've been on the street for like, what, 14 years?  12 years.  14 years.  What happened?  Where did it turn for you?  What?  Well, I chose to go to the street.  Why?  Why would you choose to go to the street, Sperm?  I got fed up with friends, so-called family and friends.  Yeah.  You know, always taking and wanting and wanting and wanting and never giving.  And then all of a sudden, I got sick, so I'm not on the street now, basically. 
[02:17:30]  What do you got?  I have AIDS.  You got the big A.  Yeah.  How did you get the AIDS, my friend?  I don't know.  IV drug user?  No.  Homosexual sex?  No.  I don't know.  Prostitutes?  Huh?  Prostitutes?  You go to a lot of hookers or you ever sell yourself?  Wait, you said yeah to the hooker thing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wow.  How long have you found out that you had the AIDS?  I just found out recently.  You just found out recently?  Yeah.  I've been in a nursing home for seven months.  Oh, are you taking any medicine for this? 
[02:18:00]  No, not anymore.  No?  No.  Why not?  What do you think you want, Matthew Johnson?  I have a permanent spot.  What?  I have a permanent spot to live at, so it's pretty hard if you miss the medication, you  know?  Oh, man.  I got to get back on track.  My girlfriend's going to help me out.  You got a girlfriend?  Yeah, I got a daughter, too.  Oh, my goodness.  Boy, what a story.  Sperm!  Yeah, now why is your name Sperm?  It's just from a friend of mine.  They used to go to his house when he used to, you know, just about to shoot, you know? 
[02:18:30]  Oh, right, right, right.  Yeah, they used to go, Sperm!  Oh, they would yell, Sperm.  Yeah, I used to say that in the prison when I would fall asleep.  That's how they used to wake me up in jail.  They would just yell it at you.  Cute little story there, Sperm.  Yeah, it's all right, you know.  Well, you know what?  We're going to help you out this holiday season.  We're going to give you some money, and you're going to be able to shop in the mall with the  rest of the homeless people.  Unfortunately, you can't buy T-cells. 
[02:19:00]  Right there, uh...  Sorry about that.  That's cool.  All right, Sperm, so we're going to see you Tuesday?  Tuesday, 1-30, 7-30, 4-T-C-T.  All right.  There you go.  Wow, he makes that up.  All right.  Thank you, Sperm.  All right.  All right, there he goes, Anthony.  Yeah.  Sperm.  All right.  He'll be helping us.  Well, he'll be part of the homeless shopping spree.  Part of the homeless shopping spree.  Sperm, and he's got the bug.  He's got the bug.  He's got the hiv, whatever you want to call it.  The doctors are laughing in the corner, Anthony. 
[02:19:30]  He's got it.  All right.  Well, that's going to make the homeless shopping spree that much more special.  There you go.  We've got to say hi to the doctors.  Yeah, we've got to say hi.  We're running out of show, and there's still so much to go.  How you doing?  And doing.  What's up, guys?  Now, what is your specialty?  We're podiatrists.  Podiatrists.  The foot doctor.  What made you pick the foot?  I don't know.  It's a good question.  I ask myself that every day.  Why not the peach? 
[02:20:00]  Why not be a peach doctor?  It's out of my scope.  Yeah.  Now, you went through a lot of medical school, I would think.  Yeah, college.  You took the same classes, a lot of people that specialize in other parts of the body,  but you picked the foot.  Pretty much.  So, like, there's never, it's probably rare that you get a day where you're like,  wow, that's a hot foot.  Yeah, it doesn't have a lot.  You know, usually pretty rude.  You'd like, let's say, Patty here with her hammered toenail.  Is this something you see a lot of?  Feet like Patty's?  Yeah.  On a lot of homeless people, actually.  Oh, God. 
[02:20:30]  Look, even the doctor's razzing you a little Patty.  Sorry, Patty.  Now, you've seen the, how are you doing, a Patty imitation.  Who's Dr. Jackalone?  Yeah, that's me.  That's your real name.  Yeah, you've got to love having your name made fun of in front of 60 million people.  Dr. Jackalone.  I want to see your license.  All right, and who's that?  That's Dr. Nester.  Nester, and that's Ed.  He's our handler.  I'm Ed.  I'm the muscle for the podiatry crowd.  Yeah.  They're kind of rough.  Right, just in case you've got to bust some heads.  Now, getting back to Patty, you've seen her feet.  Honestly, do you see a lot of hammered toes and things like this? 
[02:21:00]  To be honest with you, not to ruin the show, Patty's feet really aren't that bad.  Yeah.  They're definitely fixable.  Yeah, fixable.  She needs a little surgery.  A little surgery?  What would you do?  Keep in mind, we worked in Harlem for four years, so they're not that bad.  Really?  You've seen a lot of pretty bad stuff out there.  Yeah, off the streets and just...  So now, what would you do for feet like Patty?  Basically, it's a same-day surgery, just straighten out a hammered toes.  How do you do that, though?  You smack it with a hammer?  Nah, you remove some bone and you throw some things around and put them back there.  Look, she's never had bone in her and you're already removing some. 
[02:21:30]  Jesus Christ.  No comment.  A girl can't win.  So you cut it open a little bit, you take out some bone, you get her toes pointing forward.  You have to cut the bone and move it over to the side, shave the bump off, put a pin in it, sew the tissue back up.  When does she get to walk again?  She walks out of the hospital.  Wow.  Kind of a same-day surgery.  Hey, Patty, there you go.  Walk out with just one of those funny surgical shoes.  We can actually do that in the air if you want.  Do you put that thing around her neck, too, so she can't bite herself? 
[02:22:00]  Hey, her toes now.  Hold on.  What?  I heard something.  I don't know if he's joking.  We could maybe fix one of her toes on the air.  Yeah, I'm not joking.  Oh, wow.  Can you do it on the air?  You can do what they call office surgery, but, I mean, we would have to set up a little surgical suite or something.  That would be whatever it would take.  We would love to actually.  That would be Dr. Hamerto.  That would be Dr. Nesta doing that surgery.  Right.  Well, Patty's going to sign a waiver or two.  Of course.  What about her toenails now?  She says it's extremely painful.  Is this something normal to hammer toes or is this something else?  Yeah, sometimes if you have real bad hammer toes and you get a lot of pressure on the nails, it could be painful. 
[02:22:30]  Well, she's not the only person that doesn't like to cut their own nails, so.  Now, is it true you guys are going to be able to cut her toenails today?  Dr. Nesta brought in his equipment.  We're actually going to do that.  All right.  Fantastic.  Could you make it hurt a lot?  Because we hate this girl.  Sorry, Patty.  Shut up, Patty.  Oh, my good.  This is going to be our great.  All right.  You want me to commence to clipping?  Wait, wait.  Wait.  What happened?  Didn't we just have a porn?  We had a porn.  We did.  We just got here.  We didn't see that.  Yeah, of course not.  But we have a good segue from porn to. 
[02:23:00]  Yeah.  What happened to Patty's disgusting feet?  Aren't you supposed to do the lemon after the shot of tequila?  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, we didn't have anything to clear the paddle.  I actually brought something that you're going to like, because I was looking through my toolbox.  I hope it's a sawzall.  Because when you were describing Patty's nails on the air the other day, I was thinking about it.  And I was going to bring the belt sander.  Yeah, that would have been good.  I brought a Dremel instead, so.  The Dremel?  Yeah.  We're going to take care of our toenails with a Dremel.  Hey, Patty, would you be up to actually have one of these guys fix your feet? 
[02:23:30]  Fix your hand, but, uh...  I wouldn't mind, but I hope it don't hurt.  The pain that is your life is worse than anything that anyone could possibly inflict on you.  So don't worry about it.  All right, what do you say?  You want to get them to clipping?  Yeah, why not?  Yeah, all right.  Could someone call Terry back?  Yeah, I know.  From Terry Weigel to Cro-Magnon.  Opie, you want to be my assistant or what?  Uh...  How about, I am not even going near that half of the studio, and there's nothing you're 
[02:24:00]  going to say to make it different.  I'm not touching her, man.  Because then she's going to think it's foreplay.  I'm going to have to double glove.  That is foreplay for her.  Um...  Why don't we move over, Mike says, so we can check this out.  All right, I'll move over to, um...  That...  I'll go to the end, Mike, over there.  I'll share that.  You know what?  Get Patty up on the camera, and then I'm...  No, okay.  Yeah, you know something?  Have her lay down up there, where her feet are about where Joe Curry is.  Usually where the hot porn stars lay. 
[02:24:30]  Yeah, exactly where we dripped hot wax on a beautiful girl's ass once.  Jesus, what the hell happened?  All right, Patty, fling your feet over there.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Jesus.  My grandma has hotter legs.  Looks like a cadaver's feet soaked in water for a week.  They do.  Don't they look like cadaver feet?  Wait, hold on.  We got a mic, Patty.  Mic her, and put the mic right near the toe that you're clipping, because I want to hear 
[02:25:00]  the snap.  You're going to hear it.  Put that right near there.  This is Dr. Nestor?  That's right.  All right, here goes Dr. Nestor.  Wait, are we taking pictures?  Yeah, you were videotaping.  Oh, John's videotaping?  I'm sure the camera's off.  I know.  Here we go.  I had a very hard toenail.  Oh, God.  Wait, do you want that?  Oh, no!  Oh, stop.  Get rid of it.  No, no, no, no, no.  Don't throw it.  Hold on, shark's tooth.  Hold on.  It does look like a shark's tooth. 
[02:25:30]  Save it.  One of our listeners will eat it for concert tickets.  Guaranteed.  Guaranteed.  God.  I heard about the fungal infection in the mouth.  Oh, yeah.  How about that, huh?  Isn't that disgusting?  Ill-advised.  Very ill-advised.  Isn't that awful?  You spoke to me first.  You have it, Patty.  That's where he caught it.  What kind of fungus does poor Erin have from Stucker Patty's feet?  God only knows.  Seriously?  Yeah.  She's going to need to have her.  Does she really have an infection? 
[02:26:00]  Is that...  Yeah.  We don't make up stuff on this show.  It's probably not a good idea to be doing that.  Here comes a big one.  Well, what's going to happen?  Will it eventually go away?  Yeah, she'll probably need some antibiotics.  Well, she is on the antibiotics.  You ready?  All for Britney Spears ticket.  Oh, God.  All right, listen to this.  Oh, look at that one.  Oh, my...  That looks like what Hooper pulled out of Ben Gardner's boat.  I'm sure you don't want this.  Oh, no.  Her toenails are flying around the road. 
[02:26:30]  Oh, I know.  It's like shrapnel.  This is good radio, huh?  God damn.  You told me this isn't better than a porn star?  Come on.  Yeah.  Clipping a cadaver's foot.  It looks like a Dorito chip with guacamole on it.  Look at your feet.  They look like cadavers.  Patty, you're going to start clipping your toenails everywhere?  Yeah.  Are you going to follow through on this?  First of all, she hasn't screamed once.  It doesn't hurt.  Yeah, Patty, it doesn't hurt.  You've been lying to us.  Yeah, your dirty, unwashed feet.  Stop.  I get...  Patty. 
[02:27:00]  Patty, why haven't you clipped your toenails?  Because it's uncomfortable.  No, before it was painful.  Oh, God damn.  I can't even look at that.  I am so skeeving.  Save them, though, because like Hopi said, someone will eat those.  Auction those off on eBay.  Oh, they are...  I've never seen nails like that.  Now, Patty.  Oh, my God.  He's going to plug in.  You're actually using a Dremel.  Patty, why haven't you cut your nails?  Be honest.  Because it's uncomfortable.  He's doing it, and you're not flinching. 
[02:27:30]  You didn't flinch.  There's a deeper problem here.  But I can take a lot of pain, too.  It doesn't hurt.  I can take a lot of pain.  Take the pain.  Yeah.  Take the pain.  It's just that I'm not a complainer, so...  Oh, it's all you do.  I don't.  It's all you do.  Could you please just drill a hole in her head, and we'll listen to the air escape with that thing?  This is especially for you, Anthony.  It's a real Dremel.  Let's hear.  It is a Dremel.  It's a real Dremel.  Oh, my God.  Is it safe? 
[02:28:00]  Is it safe?  Look at her face.  Look at this fork fly off.  They're actually using an electrical tool.  Patty, what do you think?  It's weird.  It doesn't hurt, though, does it?  It just feels weird.  Reese's monkey feet.  Oh, my God.  I'd rather breathe in something off a Dashiell's letter than the dust that is coming off of her toe.  I'm immune to this by now.  Oh, God.  You're breathing in her foot juice.  Patty, what do you mean by it's weird? 
[02:28:30]  It just feels weird.  It just feels like, like, I don't know.  Yeah, you know nothing.  Yeah.  They're grinding them all down.  There they go.  Now, she shouldn't have a problem keeping up on this toenail clipping, right?  I don't see why she has a problem to begin with.  Thank you.  No, usually about every eight weeks. 
[02:29:00]  Patty, you're young.  You're relatively healthy looking.  Every two months.  Oof.  I just think it's one of those things out of sight, out of mind, like her lap.  She just doesn't pay any attention to it.  It's like the Discovery Channel when they drug the gorilla and bring it in.  Yeah, they drag it in, clip its nails, put a tag on it, and let it out.  Put a radio collar on her.  All right, Patty.  That's about as good as it's going to get.  There you go.  Yes.  Toe-nail dust.  That's it, Patty.  What do you think of your toes?  They look okay.  It'll be more comfortable to wear shoes. 
[02:29:30]  No ass.  How is she supposed to hunt small game with that?  Yeah.  It's hard to catch the rabbit in your talons.  Climbing trees is out of the question.  You don't have to worry about the toes crawling underneath anymore.  But I don't have fungus under them, do I?  I think you have a little fungus, man.  You got a little fungus.  You said everybody has a little of that.  You know.  A little, maybe.  Don't look like moss.  Yeah, yours is disgusting.  I don't have that.  Looks like pudding.  You infected another person with your foot.  You did.  You infected somebody. 
[02:30:00]  My God.  There's a girl who can't give a hummer because of your feet.  Thank you.  You took another one out of the mix.  Great.  All right, Patty.  There you go.  And we'll see if we can arrange getting her feet fixed.  Live on the show.  Possibly.  Possibly.  We can fix some of those hammer toes.  The bunion.  They're going to have to.  Well, what about the elbow there?  Yeah, this is what we call a bunion.  This needs to be removed.  You can cut the bone, shift it over.  Why are you pointing at her head?  Screws in there.  I'm sorry. 
[02:30:30]  I thought that was the foot.  Oh, okay.  That's what she's going to have to go to the hospital for.  You know, taking care of her feet like this, why fix the foundation when the building's condemned?  I'm not condemned.  I love that she even has to say stuff like that.  I'm not condemned.  No.  Ugh.  Feet of the damned.  Jesus Christ.  Well, we've got to thank Dr. Jackalone.  Yes.  Dr. Nestor and Ed.  I don't know what Ed did.  Ed, the assistant.  Ed is the assistant.  Just watching.  We got chased by a couple of old women in sensible shoes on the way and I took care of them. 
[02:31:00]  Fix my feet.  Could you fix my feet?  What you guys must deal with on a daily basis.  Yeah, it gets pretty rough sometimes.  I have a sore between my toes that I don't know.  I see you've been to the podiatrist.  A little gangrene or something.  We also do hyperbarics.  We do hyperbaric treatment for people who got bad feet.  What is that?  That's put people in.  It's like a decompression chamber, what divers use, but now we use it for wound care.  Retreat chronically.  That's great.  Yeah, it works really well.  For some reason, in a lower pressure, it heals better, is that it? 
[02:31:30]  Higher pressure.  Higher pressure, yeah?  Right.  Can't we just send Patty to Jupiter?  We could put Patty in the chamber and see what happens there.  For about six or seven days.  Yeah, with no air in it.  Please.  All right.  Well, doctors, thank you very much.  We'll be looking forward to maybe fixing Patty's feet.  Quite frankly, I just like to do it the way, what was that movie?  Roots.  Where she hobbled.  Or that, okay.  That's a good one.  Yeah, you're thinking of misery.  Misery. 
[02:32:00]  I'd like to fix her feet that way.  Oh, no.  With the four-by-four between her ankles and take the sledgehammer to it.  That's not even a good way.  The book was better, because in the book, she chops his foot off with a hatchet and blowtorches the stump.  Really?  Yeah, that's the book.  Can we do that?  We actually do that.  Is that one of the treatments?  Patty, we're going to do that.  Chop your foot off with an axe and blowtorch it.  No.  By the way, a lot of people calling in saying they would eat Patty's toenails.  Are you kidding?  Well, you know something.  A lot.  I mean, look, and they're not even kidding. 
[02:32:30]  Tony, Rick, save them in some bag.  Hey.  Yeah.  Hey, my bad.  I'm sorry.  I forgot.  All right.  But you'll eat the toenails, huh?  Yeah.  All right.  We're going to have to figure something out.  Like an Xbox or something.  No, we got something planned for our last Xbox of the season.  We'll let you know next week, all right?  All right.  All right.  Thank you, Tony.  All right, man.  Thank you.  Yeah, this guy brings up a good point.  Chris, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, guys? 
[02:33:00]  Hey.  I want to know if that looked like the scene at Dumb and Dumber when they're grinding down  his toes on Patty.  Yeah, exactly.  Pretty close.  Pretty similar.  Pretty much exactly what they did.  They took a big sanding Dremel and sanded her toenails down.  All right.  Stinky rules.  Stinky rules rules.  Patty, isn't it odd to you that they couldn't even use conventional toe-clipping tools?  They had to go to, like, stuff that had to be plugged in?  Right out of the toolbox.  Patty, what are you doing to yourself?  Well, it's just that when I do it myself, it's very uncomfortable. 
[02:33:30]  Uncomfortable?  Well, life sucks.  It just encourages me.  It's uncomfortable just having you here.  Big bunion, hammer toe.  Hey, Ray, what's up?  How you doing?  Same thing when I done something.  Hey, man, we can do some lines, man.  Yeah, let's snort Patty's toenail dust all over the console.  You'll have a trip like when Morrison took those mushrooms.  Swear to God, you'll see you in the desert.  All right, Ray, thanks.  Well, guys, thank you for coming by.  Yeah, thanks a lot, guys.  Dr. Jacqueline is priding me to give out the phone number for you. 
[02:34:00]  No problem.  You should, though.  Go ahead.  I have offices in Glen Cove, in Flushing, and in Long Beach.  The number is 516-889-0969.  There you go.  Thank you, guys.  Thank you.  Say the number again.  Any foot problems?  516-889-0969.  Okay.  They are real foot doctors, podiatrists.  Don't be fooled about this program.  Do you have a website?  Yeah, footcare.tv or woundcare.tv.  Oh, you went to that .tv thing, didn't you?  Yeah, well, you know.  You're the guy. 
[02:34:30]  Patty, any final words?  You want to at least thank the .com is a fad?  Yeah, so thank you very much for helping me.  You won't.  Okay.  Thanks for having us, guys.  She's in love with him now.  It's like, yeah.  I just want to say hi to everybody in the Franklin Square Munson Fire Department out of Long Island.  What was that?  Franklin Square Munson Fire Department.  I remember that.  I just want to say hi to everybody.  All right.  Thank you.  See, Ed behaved himself to the last minute, and then he lost it.  No, Ed, that's cool.  It's all right.  We like it.  Thanks, guys.  Take it easy, guys.  Thank you again, and we'll be in touch. 
[02:35:00]  Okay.  There they go, and there goes Patty.  Look, she almost fell over because she can't balance anymore on her toenails.  Oh, my God.  There's dust on the top of the top.  I know.  Why don't you donate those nails to a tribe?  They can make a canoe out of it.  Disgusting.  I'm not disgusted.  Can you imagine sniffing one of those nails?  Let's draw.  Let's make a necklace.  Oh, my God.  Like a shark tooth necklace.  Shark tooth. 
[02:35:30]  Hold it.  And you just put it against your two nostrils.  And take a sniff.  Smells dirty and lonely.  Patty, don't you understand when men have to come in and use bolt cutters to cut your toenails  that maybe there's a problem?  And electrical tools.  Maybe you should have taken care of it.  And if those things grow back, we're not helping you out anymore.  Don't you realize how much we've helped you over the past, except for the shaved head thing.  But for the most part.  All right.  Get out of here.  Bye, Patty.  Okay. 
[02:36:00]  Anthony, we'll take a break.  We'll play What Do We Learn Next on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  But as we go to break, something from the O&A archives.  Okay.  People were digging the Bob Hope earlier.  Oh, that's right.  So I found Bob Hope possibly being, I don't know.  Oh, this was when John Glenn went into space.  Remember on the shuttle a while back a couple of years ago?  And he was the oldest guy in space.  And we thought maybe another elderly gentleman should have gone.  Thank you.  Thanks for the setup.  Here it is.  John Glenn will be the oldest man in space. 
[02:36:30]  But who knows, maybe in a few months they'll send Bob Hope up into space.  Hey, I got to tell you, this is Bob.  Where the hell's the Grim Reaper Hope?  It's great to be here on the space shuttle.  Hey, that payload section's big enough for Charo's ass, isn't it?  How about that brook shield?  Hey, my eyes are bleeding.  Hey, is that the sunset or blood on my corneas?  I can't tell.  But I got to tell you, hey, how about that zero gravity, huh?  Hey, my ball sack's bouncing around like a hippity hop. 
[02:37:00]  It's like I got a pound of milk and Turkish taffy in my underwear.  Hey, John Glenn, pass the Viagra.  I got to take a leak.  Can't even leak without Viagra.  My prostate looks like the surface of the moon.  Ouch.  Hey, where's Susan Anton?  Hey, me and Bing are making a new film, On the Road to the Cemetery.  Hey, from the space shuttle live, I want to say hi to my wife of 70 years, Dolores. 
[02:37:30]  I don't want to say she's dry, but boy, that'd be a tough re-entry.  She couldn't get wet in her age, Dolores.  Hey, John, is that a black hole?  I haven't seen a black hole since I showered with Sammy Davis Jr.  Hey, my eyes look like dirt-flaming meteors.  I don't want to say my eyes are shot, but one time in Vegas, I went down on Sinatra's toupee.  Hey, what's this mission control? 
[02:38:00]  I'm still working on vowel control.  My roids are hanging like tapestry.  Hey, I got to go, but you've been great on the space shuttle.  Thank you.  Roger, mission control.  Get me out of here.  That's not an umbilical cord I'm using on the spacewalk.  It's my ball.  So that's what it would sound like with Bob Hope in space, huh?  What?  What?  I missed it.  I was out of the room.  Yeah, where were you? 
[02:38:30]  I just missed it.  I had to use the laboratory.  Oh, okay.  You guys have redefined debauchery.  It's like a Vaudeville show on acid.  Opie Anthony.  Man, we had fun today.  Yes.  It only gets better tomorrow.  Tomorrow.  What the hell is that?  I'm the Opie and Anthony program.  Again, we'll be helping.  My God.  Do we, does the helping ever stop from this program?  Who's not listening tomorrow? 
[02:39:00]  We finally find out what Twato is tomorrow on the show.  I like this.  You know what we should do, though, for some of the people in certain cities that might not  have been a board when we first discovered Twato?  Well, maybe Rick could dig up the first time we found out about and witnessed Twato.  Good, good, good, good.  And then we could play that as a little prelude to finding out what it is.  Hell, two less minutes of programming for us that we have to worry about tomorrow.  We're on the same page. 
[02:39:30]  All right, four hours a day.  Okay, that'll kill two minutes.  Pitching about stations, that kills 20 minutes.  Whatever works, gets you through.  All right.  Let's see.  Glenn the Tool learned a lot, but let's just start off with,  I learned that Norton thinks Louis Black has a delicious C.  And Earl cannot escape abuse even in the hospital. 
[02:40:00]  That's very true.  Brian from Philly, I learned the following today.  A porn star that doesn't take it in the third input, prude.  T-cells are not for sale.  Bummer.  Bummer.  Pat from Jersey, I learned that four-star dumpsters and pirates do exist  and that Patty can take a lot of pain because she has to look in the mirror every morning.  Turn off your radio guy's number one fan wants to know,  do you think turn off your radio guy will be checking in today?  Yeah, he never checked in today. 
[02:40:30]  You know, I was almost psyched to hear from turn down the radio guy.  He was very fun yesterday.  He was fun.  Maybe he'll be on the show tomorrow.  You can only dream, Anthony.  He doesn't want to burn out the character, maybe.  I understand that.  Maybe that's it.  Matt, what's up?  Yo, I want to be your what-did-I-learn-on-the-show-yesterday guy.  You are also known as Day-Late guy.  All right, sure.  Jay is at Jay Moore's hometown.  We're state champs.  Oh, all right.  All right, well, that was from yesterday.  So, okay, you're officially what-did-I-learn-on-the-show-yesterday or Day-Late guy. 
[02:41:00]  And no one ripped Matt off with that one.  No.  Okay, thank you.  Let's go to Turkish.  Turkish, what's up?  Hey, guys, I learned two things.  I learned one, stinky smuggle sex toys out of N.E.W., and I learned two, that thanks to Patty,  there's one more chick in the world that won't give a hummer.  And I got a question?  Yeah.  Yeah, Patty, Sandy Kane's going to be in tomorrow, right?  Yeah.  I'll suck on Twatto if you got prizes.  You will suck on Little Twatto.  Yes, I will.  Oh, my God. 
[02:41:30]  Hold on, Lauren.  All right.  Hold on.  You know, we've been...  Who are we to say no?  Because we've been looking for somebody that would actually do that.  I can't...  Look, I'm thinking...  Stop it.  Get out of my head!  The image of it is too much.  Chris Kattan checking in, Anthony.  Hey, Chris Kattan.  Hey, you guys want to make out?  Oh, I don't want to make out.  You faggot.  Hey, you want to stick fingers in my blue knot?  No, we don't want to do that.  No, why would you say that?  What happened to that whore?  God, are you serious, Chris Kattan? 
[02:42:00]  I love whores.  You like the terry waggle?  Yeah, I love it.  I want to make out.  You like the chicks?  I love it.  I want to make out with her.  Sure you do.  I'm a fairy.  Bro, what's up, man?  You had me riled up for a day and a half.  I know.  What's going on?  I actually called.  I was going to give you guys the number.  There was a direct line.  I was ready to just go to war.  You know what I heard Chris Kattan doing? 
[02:42:30]  It's weird.  He's not even married and has no kids, but he talks about his wife being pregnant.  What?  I'm kidding, Brewer.  I thought that's Brewer's there.  That's Brewer's there.  That one just hit me in the back of the head.  Don't break.  Oh, I got you.  Morse code.  He has something in common with your wife, by the way.  His back door has fallen out.  Oh, nice.  Who could dance? 
[02:43:00]  That's from all the other closet almost in Hollywood.  All right.  So what's up, bro?  No, man.  I just want to let dudes know I'm playing this little rock club tonight.  Where at?  But it's called the Wreck Room in Warrington.  Yeah.  Well, I'm just screwing around.  I'm going to get stinktified before I go up there.  Okay.  Don't expect like a major show.  I'm just hanging out.  Get up there, hang out, get hangtified.  I get stinktified. 
[02:43:30]  And that's it.  And then after that, I'm going to go to rehearsal, find Katan, and just punch him out.  Actually, no.  I'm going to give him a new story.  I'm going to give him my seer story.  Maybe he can steal that, too.  Yeah, maybe he can do that one.  Love that story.  All right, Brewer.  We've got to close the show.  I'll talk to you guys later.  Thank you, Jim.  Later, Jim.  Oh, yeah.  There we go.  Want to make out?  We have a lot of money.  We have a lot of pals, don't we?  Yeah. 
[02:44:00]  Dan, what's going on?  Hey, what's up?  Hey.  I learned that Terry Weigel is the Susan Lucci of the ABN Awards.  Yeah, the Adult Video Awards.  Yeah, isn't that awful?  Well, that's good.  Susan Lucci, uh, La Lucci, she can't get the anal award.  All right, thank you, Dan.  She doesn't get the anal award.  Thank you.  All right, take it easy.  What's wrong with La Lucci?  She can't get the anal award, Gellman.  Oh, save the Regis story for tomorrow. 
[02:44:30]  Yeah.  Got all about that.  Megan from Boston, what's up?  Hey, how are you?  Hey.  Doing great.  I wanted to tell you what I learned today.  Okay.  That there's a new STD, and it's called Stalker Toe Disease.  I got the Stalker Toe Disease.  Oh, how nasty is she?  It comes from good hygiene.  Thank you, Megan.  Have a good night.  I want to acknowledge once again the guys that are hanging outside WBCN Studios every Wednesday for Whip Them Out Wednesday.  These guys will not give up.  I think they're going to do it every Wednesday through the winter. 
[02:45:00]  Didn't they give them pizza?  I think they got pizza, yeah.  They're getting stuff every Wednesday now.  Yeah, that's cool.  Definitely cool.  That's some hardcore fans right there, Anthony.  A little support.  Danielle from Alabama, I learned today our Invisible Man is better than their Invisible Man.  And Norton is playing at Jersey Chokers.  Jokers.  Jokers, damn it.  She said chokers.  It's Jersey Chokers.  Eddie, what's up?  What's up, boys?  What's going on?  I learned that getting killed by a pirate, most unlucky lottery guy. 
[02:45:30]  Arr.  Everything on the internet is true.  Yeah.  And Opie wishes he had a grandpa like a Rumsfeld.  That's true, man.  Right on, boys.  A real man.  Didn't drown his sorrows with a bottle.  Oh.  A go-getter.  A go-getter.  Scott Moxie.  That's right.  Are we done?  I guess we're done.  Huh?  You're all fake.  Well, we'll get the Earl thing on tomorrow, though.  Yeah, we could do that.  We could do it tomorrow. 
[02:46:00]  We'll play the Earl thing.  If you missed the Earl tribute, oh, my God, make sure you're listening early tomorrow, because  we'll replay it for you.  Yes.  Steve did a great job from FoundryMusic.com.  Touching.  Based on Brian's song, but it's for Earl.  Jim from Philly, what up?  Yeah, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Yo, I learned today that Norton's grandmother's quiet in bed.  Yeah, you guys, you get to rule down here.  You guys are getting...  Yeah.  What?  It was edited.  He just edited himself.  All right.  Thanks, man. 
[02:46:30]  Thanks, man.  I think we ruled, and then something.  30-second homeless clip.  Yeah?  No, we got to go.  Yeah, we got to get.  We'll do all that.  Oh, oh, Louis Black.  I want to thank him for stopping by today.  He's playing Carolines tonight through Sunday.  A bunch of us are going down to see him tonight, Anthony and Carolines.  So we'll see you there.  And if you're not there, Joe Curry at Governor's with Adam Ferrara.  Friday and Saturday.  Come on down.  Adam's there tonight without me, but we will be together.  Steve.  Friday and Saturday.  How the hell is he going to do a show without you, foot? 
[02:47:00]  Well, you got another guy.  All right.  Let me get someone out.  Let me get another guy.  We have governors tonight and over the weekend.  Okay.  We got a couple Aerosmith CD prize packs, Anthony.  Prize pack includes four CDs.  Really?  Young, the lost.  What?  Aerosmith, Anthony.  You don't like Aerosmith?  It's not ours.  Wow.  I used to like Dream On.  It's not ours.  He stinks.  Pump Permanent Vacation and Get a Grip, courtesy of Universal Entertainment.  So if you're on hold right now, we'll give a couple of you guys that prize pack. 
[02:47:30]  I think it's heavy.  All right.  Tomorrow.  What now?  Tomorrow on the show?  What the hell is that?  Don't miss it.  The Opie and Anthony show.  It's usually just a bunch of guys sweating and burping and farting.  Hail for the kings of the radio. </pre>
