<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with a montage of promotional material emphasizing its shock-jock style.  Opie and Jimmy (with Anthony notably late due to alarm clock and phone malfunctions, leaving him stuck in Lefrak City traffic) discussed Jimmy's cockroach encounter at the Mercer Kitchen and the lack of a compensatory free dessert.  Anthony's tardiness fueled further discussion.  Listener calls included a waitress recounting adding ingredients to a disgruntled customer's cheesecake.  The hosts then covered Britney Spears’ sister’s teen pregnancy, the ongoing Britney Spears/Kevin Federline saga, the Knicks’ poor performance (including a fan ejected for a "Fire Isaiah" sign), and Roger Clemens' steroid denial.  Pete Rose's steroid comments and gambling history were also debated. A caller's OJ Simpson joke prompted a rebuke from the hosts.  The show promoted “Whip Him Out Wednesday” and “Wake Up Your Spouse Wednesday.”

Ricky Gervais called in, with Opie apologizing for a past awkward encounter involving a mistaken DVD promotion.  They discussed Gervais' show *Extras*, his live tour, past appearances on the show (including a controversial segment with a homeless man), his views on comedy (including his dislike of puns and catchphrases), his past band, and live performance. Paul McCartney’s divorce was briefly mentioned.  The conversation was punctuated with crude language, sexual innuendo, and references to controversial figures and events.  Further promotion of Gervais’ tour followed.

The show continued with a call-in segment featuring Opie, Anthony, Jim Norton (who advertised his upcoming tour and gave away tickets, including VIP passes and parking, to his New Year's Eve show), and various listeners.  An apology for prior "filthy language" was issued. The hosts discussed the dangerous "Cinnamon Challenge" after witnessing a near-fatal attempt.  A caller shared his girlfriend’s negative reaction to Anthony’s gun-focused podcast.  News stories were discussed, including a woman groping a mall Santa (resulting in sexually suggestive commentary) and a death on Disney World's Expedition Everest, sparking a lengthy discussion about deaths and injuries at Disney parks and their reporting practices. Callers shared their Disney experiences, including instances of fear and crying, eliciting humorous speculation and dark humor from the hosts.

The conversation then shifted to Michael Vick and the controversy surrounding his NFL teammates' support, a caller questioned the leniency of his sentence, and the hosts debated his potential NFL return. Further calls included discussions about Bowser (of Sha Na Na) and the emotional responses he elicited, a caller recounting a toe severed on a Disneyland ride, and another detailing the frightening aspects of Disney’s defunct Alien Encounter. Chris Simon's hockey suspension and the Roger Clemens steroid scandal were also revisited.  The segment concluded with a humorous anecdote about a tow truck driver attempting to tow a police car.

The final segment focused on listener experiences of crying at concerts and other events, beginning with another news story about a man hooking his truck to a police car after receiving a ticket. Opie, Anthony, and E-Rock shared their own crying experiences (amusement parks, shows, Sha Na Na concert). Danny described crying at a Metallica concert due to the unexpected setlist ("Metal Militia," "Dire's Eve"). Opie recounted an emotional Leonard Skinner concert moment. A caller shared crying during a U2 concert tribute to 9/11 victims. Other callers described emotional responses to various concerts (Coldplay, Springsteen, Black Sabbath), Broadway shows (Les Misérables, Wicked), movies (Cool Runnings, Planes, Trains, and Automobiles, Miracle, Rudy, Castaway, Field of Dreams), and even the "Snoopy Come Home" special.  The hosts and callers discussed the reasons for their emotional responses, including playful ribbing about the masculinity of crying. The segment concluded with ticket giveaways for Opie's New Year's Eve show and a snippet of a Metallica song.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  In the world of Radio Shock Shock, the biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their office.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why? Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good.  Go screw!  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony.  trajectcards, Opie and Anthony. 
[00:00:30]  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Rock show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shot Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  GPS.  Opie and Anthony, Opie and Anthony.  Shot Jocks, Opie and Anthony, Opie and Anthony.  Testing one, two, one, two.  Poe, poe, boo-boe, banana, nana.  Banana, fana, foe-foe, fee-fi-mo-mo.  Poe!  Who thought you were dead?  The people you were partying with?  Dealers, yeah.  Dealers and stuff, and they just threw them in a dumpster in London. 
[00:01:00]  Well, you know, I left them there.  I think it's pretty funny, and no one wants to get rock star.  This is where entertainment is going.  I shot my computer.  You can't shoot guns in suburbia.  And I fully expected the police to show up.  This is showing responsibility.  Opie and Anthony.  I think worse than having sex with a man would be, as you're kissing one,  to feel his manhand holding your head like the sweat of a manhand right on the face of your neck.  This is the worst show I've ever seen.  This is the worst show I've ever been on. 
[00:01:30]  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get this show on the road.  Good morning.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  Sands, Anthony.  It feels lonely in here.  It's just me and old Jimmy for now.  I believe Anthony's on his way. 
[00:02:00]  It's so weird to look from my left and not see that little sweetie in his chair.  I've never seen that before.  I've never not seen Anthony in the studio.  Yeah.  He overslept.  But he's on his way.  He's on his way.  I hope he's not doing 150.  If you're listening right now, you psychopath, stop at the lights.  The show will be here when you get here.  He's probably right now up on the sidewalks driving like an animal.  And he's getting himself killed if they're not getting here at all.  Phone number 877-212-ON-A. 
[00:02:30]  And Jimmy was telling me just before we went on the air about his experience at a restaurant  last night with cockroaches.  It's amazing how, like, no matter where you go, if you're going to go out to eat, you're  going to have roaches somewhere in the building.  And especially in New York, you can't avoid it.  So I'm not naive enough to think that because it's a nice restaurant, you're not going to  see a bug.  But when you're out and you're paying $100 to eat.  Yeah.  And you're sitting next to a wall and a roach crawls.  And you go to the waitress, hey, come here.  And she sees the roach and she kills it. 
[00:03:00]  And then she moves.  How did she kill it?  With her, like, towel.  Probably the same thing.  She wiped her table off with her finished stupid bitch.  Right in front of you guys?  Oh, yeah.  She says, whap!  My girlfriend was like, ah!  And I was just, like, letting...  I figured, look, we're going to get at least a free dessert.  Yeah.  I mean, you know, I don't want a free meal.  It wasn't like it was a rat.  But it was a roach.  So she swats it and falls to the ground and she steps on it.  It's a full restaurant.  Did she just kick it under the table where your girlfriend was sitting?  Well, when she hit it, it fell. 
[00:03:30]  And my girlfriend kind of screamed and scooched over.  And the waitress was very panic-stricken because nobody wants you screaming about cockroaches  in a full restaurant.  So she stepped on it.  And I'm like, look, can we move to the next table?  And she's like, yes.  Thank you.  She thanked us because we didn't cause a big scene.  And we moved over to the next table.  And we finished.  And it's like, can't you give somebody a free dessert?  I mean, am I being a complete chiseler by wanting a $12 dessert?  At the very least, they got acknowledged that you had a cockroach.  A dessert?  Put it in your sorbet or something. 
[00:04:00]  Cut it in half.  Put it on the top of your sorbet.  All I wanted.  See, when you start telling the story and you were talking about a cockroach, I'm like,  so?  There's no surprise there.  Right.  You know, you shouldn't be shocked to see a cockroach in a restaurant in New York.  And you were saying it's like a basement restaurant?  It's a place called the Mercer Kitchen.  Oh, Mercer Kitchen is a killer spot.  Yeah, I know it is.  The Mercer Kitchen in Soho.  And the food was good.  I'm not going to dump on the place and say it sucked because it didn't suck.  Wow, they had a cockroach.  Yeah. 
[00:04:30]  Now I'm a little more surprised.  Yeah.  I mean, but it's a good place.  You're going to get one even in a good place.  Right, right.  It's okay.  But whenever you sit next to a wall in New York, you risk that.  You know the comfort you get from laying against the wall when a girl is boring you talking?  That's the risk.  The risk you take is that an animal is going to crawl out and bite you.  And you know what they say.  If there's one cockroach, there's hundreds, if not thousands.  I know.  And anywhere I go, I know there's a roach.  Right.  Anywhere I eat, I know there's a roach somewhere.  But you don't want to see it.  But it happened in another place that we ate at one time.  There was a little roach on the wall. 
[00:05:00]  Same thing.  Waitress killed it.  And then we had our dessert.  And literally every time we went in there for the next two months, they would comp us a dessert.  And we never, you know, we just had berries.  I mean, I eat $12 desserts.  I don't eat big ones.  It just really irritated me that nobody would think that when you see a bug, like a roach,  that give the guy a free berries.  Yeah.  So.  At the very least, they got to acknowledge it and then take something off the check there.  Yes.  We got Anthony from the Opie and Anthony Show online.  Oh, Anthony.  Anthony.  Hi.  Anthony, welcome aboard. 
[00:05:30]  First time, long time?  Anthony.  What's going on?  I can't, I can't hear you.  Why?  Sorry, I, I dropped the palm.  He cursed?  I have no idea.  Well, no one heard it.  Uh, what are you talking to, a construction cone?  Who is this?  This isn't Anthony.  What's the matter?  You can't hear me that well? 
[00:06:00]  No, I can hear you.  Yeah, what's going on?  Okay, good.  I got to lean forward now so I can talk into my speaker.  Where are you, sweetie?  A cataclysmic breakdown of events.  My phone didn't work and the alarm didn't go off.  Well, are you all right?  I'm stuck, I'm stuck in traffic.  Okay.  Which I'm never in in the morning.  That puts me in a great mood.  I'm at, um, I'm at the wonderful Lefrak City off the expressway in Queens. 
[00:06:30]  Oh, I can't, you know, a little worse feeling.  I don't know what I'm looking at.  I can go, there's no way to make it.  I don't know what I do.  Hello?  Hello?  I can, you, we can hear you a little bit, Ant, but you're kind of fading, you, like,  I can hear you a little bit and kind of know what you're saying because, like, I kind of  understand what you're saying, but it's, you, you're kind of fading in and out.  Are you kidding me?  No.  No.  Jesus Christ. 
[00:07:00]  Maybe I'll try my other phone.  All right, so you're in a little bit of traffic.  You're coming into the city.  Um, you'll be here in five minutes?  Uh, yeah.  Five.  That's the worst feeling, though, when you wake up and you, and you realize you've slept  through your alarm or the alarm didn't go off, there's no worse feeling.  Uh, believe me, I've been on, I've been in the cab a few times listening to the show  on the way in.  And it's all, and I'm only Norton of the Opie, when you're Anthony of the Opie and Anthony  show, it's going to feel awful.  But don't do 150. 
[00:07:30]  What's that?  It's the worst.  I don't know how Ron Bennington does it.  It's been like two seconds before the show starts.  Like Sinatra.  How, when did you realize, like, at what point did you realize, okay, maybe I can make it  if I fly in?  At what point did you realize, I'm not going to make it?  Hopefully it did.  Uh, hold on two seconds.  Okay.  Um, I'm late.  Dude.  I'm saying.  What is this, what is this, is it good or bad? 
[00:08:00]  I have no idea.  Is this a cop that's helping me, or four black gentlemen are opening my vehicle?  Now I got fans beeping at me.  Oh, people are beeping at you?  Yes, fans of the show are beeping at me because I just gave my location.  Oh, that's hilarious.  Well, at least we know people listening to this crap.  Well, tell them to get out of your way.  Yeah, exactly.  Now I just passed a cop, and traffic's opening up, so I can go faster, but I'm risking being 
[00:08:30]  pulled over.  Uh, well don't go get pulled over because that'll be a hassle.  By the time you show them who you are, it'll take a while.  You'll have to call down to the station, realize you're wanted on other things.  War crimes in the 40s, Mill Hall yet, anyway.  So what exit do you buy, love?  Yeah.  All right.  I'll be in a couple of minutes.  All right.  You answer any questions you want.  All right.  All right, Ant.  It's Nikia from Long Island.  What's up, Nikia?  You're on the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:09:00]  How are you?  Hey, how you doing?  Uh, Nikia, you don't want a free dessert after what you answer, trust me.  I was a waitress at a restaurant, and I'm not going to name it, but we, um, they wanted  a free dessert.  I'm like, okay, sure.  And they raised a big stink.  You are nice about it.  But we put a little something extra in their fried cheesecake.  Wait, what, were they nice about it or no?  No, they raised a stink.  What did you add to the cheesecake?  Well, let's just say everybody gave a little of themselves and the fried cheesecake, and 
[00:09:30]  then we fried it.  So a little bit of love and a little bit of ourselves from the fried cheesecake.  See, my girl and the Philly crew, they're big fans of not raising a stink at restaurants.  They're big fans of not telling the waiter to take the food back and cook it a little  more.  If, if, if, if, if their food comes out and it's wrong, they won't say a word.  They'll just eat whatever is put in front of them.  They are paranoid and, and petrified that if you raise any type of stink at a restaurant, 
[00:10:00]  you're, you're going to get something extra in your cheesecake.  See, I think that if the people.  Huh?  Did she work in the restaurant or was a waitress?  No.  I mean, my brother's in the restaurant business and, uh, you know, he's told me some horror  stories over the years.  Um, he, he does, he certainly doesn't do that now that he's a restaurant owner, but he's,  uh, he's seen it all.  He wants to write a book about it someday.  But if you're, if you're the, this is the thing, I'm never rude.  Like the problem, anyone who's rude to someone handling their food is out of their minds.  Right.  But I've sent steak back, but I'm always like, look, could you please, I'm always very polite  about it.  Would you spit in someone's food if they were really polite about sending it back? 
[00:10:30]  No, really polite.  Cause I have nothing to do with the food.  Yeah.  And sometimes I have nothing to do with the roaches.  It's the management.  When they raise the same thing that it's my fault and that there's, there's rats in there  and there's roaches in there.  It's not my fault.  It's management's fault.  And they make me feel like an idiot in front of all the other guests.  Right.  Well then.  Not a lot.  That's different.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's so different.  Jimmy didn't raise a, raise a much of a fuss.  And of course you got to do something.  You got to acknowledge that you just killed a roach in front of a, in front of a couple 
[00:11:00]  trying to have a, trying to have a romantic dinner with candlelight.  It's not like they were in a store buying work boots.  This was a place of love.  Hey, we knocked off the appetizer.  You just got to do something.  Acknowledge it.  All right.  Thank you.  Uh, Nick here.  All right.  Take care.  All right.  Very good.  Yeah.  I can't see screaming at somebody who's going to be touching my food.  I mean, I would just never do it, but I'll send, I'm not going to eat raw steak because  I'm afraid they're going to vomit in it.  I mean, if they do, they do.  You just got to be really nice about it.  Yeah.  Uh, there is a lot going on today.  I saw that Spears, I'll say this Spears was in the news today. 
[00:11:30]  I'm like, who cares enough with this Britney Spears.  And then it turns out it's a Britney's kid sister and she's pregnant.  That's right.  Britney Spears' kid sister is pregnant.  She's 16.  Oh my God.  She's 12 months pregnant to, I guess, a long, 12 weeks.  Uh, 12, what did I say?  12 months.  Oh my God.  She's no longer a human being.  She's some sort of a morphed species.  Can you imagine?  Uh, 12 weeks pregnant. 
[00:12:00]  It's her long-term, uh, boyfriend.  Oh, okay.  They've been together since they were 13 years old.  He's 18.  She's 16.  They're both, uh, good Christian people.  Apparently.  And, yeah, exactly.  And, uh, yeah, she's pregnant.  She's going to keep the baby.  She's 16 years old.  How amazing is that?  Why?  She's a sexy girl, too.  Why would you keep...  What is wrong with this?  I kind of like them now.  They really are white trashy.  Oh, they're just proving how white trashy they are.  I mean, Britney had this amazing career.  She's this amazing performer, average singer. 
[00:12:30]  And Kay Fed, the dirty backup dancer, comes in and just, he just wrecks it.  He's not that good bang he was.  He ruined an icon.  Absolutely.  And he's going to get paid handsomely for it.  Yeah.  I mean, the bottom line is, she's just proving what a complete idiot she is.  Like, how do you, in the middle of a custody battle, continually go out drinking with pink  hair?  How do you...  You've got to kind of mellow out.  Put on, like, a little black grieving thing and, you know, go out and have dinner with responsible  people.  Well, people are saying, you know, she's just completely insane.  This isn't even about pills and drugs. 
[00:13:00]  She's just out of her mind.  Do you think she wants her kids, though?  Maybe she doesn't want them.  I don't even think she knows what she wants at this point.  She's completely lost.  Completely.  I'm starting to think that maybe she likes the idea of losing the kids in a way like,  hey, look, Kay Fed has them.  I'll see them once in a while.  I can go out and do what I want to do.  And let this idiot and his ex-girlfriend and her kids take care of them.  Because...  I think she's just lost.  She never had proper parenting, if you really want to get into it.  And became a star way too early.  And she's just in a bad place. 
[00:13:30]  A real bad place.  So, Brittany's kid sister, pregnant.  16 years old.  12 weeks pregnant.  I started imagining what a 12-month pregnancy would look like.  Yeah.  I'd be like, should we be giving birth to someone who's 11 years old?  A hand just popping out, going, give me that!  Yeah, it's a beer.  Pull the back in.  Just feeding itself.  Give me that.  Also here in New York, Isaiah Thomas.  The Knicks are probably one of the...  I don't even know, because I don't even follow the Knicks these days.  But they're pretty much one of the worst teams in basketball. 
[00:14:00]  And a guy got kicked out of the game last night for holding up a sign that just said,  Fire Isaiah.  It was on his, I guess, his dinner tray.  It's on the front page of the Daily News.  Fire Isaiah.  And he was pretty much sitting right behind Isaiah.  So he got a big laugh from the people at the Garden last night, or Monday night.  And they kicked him out for that, because you're not allowed to have signs at the Garden.  I didn't know that.  So the only reason I'm mentioning this, because it's going to be a lot of fun tonight, 
[00:14:30]  and the rest of the country can enjoy this, the Daily News on page three has made their  Fire Isaiah sign, where you're supposed to cut it out and bring it to the game tonight.  And then it says, to be held up during next Knicks blowout.  Wow.  So I don't know how they're going to control that at the Garden, because they're pretty  serious about not having signs inside at the Garden.  But because of this guy getting kicked out for just stating that he wants Isaiah fired, 
[00:15:00]  the Daily News is jumping on the bandwagon here, and encouraging everyone to go to the  game with their Fire Isaiah sign that's in the Daily News today on page three.  He's absolutely going to get dumped.  I mean, it's kind of rough, if you're Pat Riley in 1986, and you lose $11.5 million  for sexually harassing somebody, that's bad.  But when you have a record like Isaiah Thomas has, you better not, either you better be  in first place and have clinched a playoff berth, or you better not lose $11 million  in a sexual harassment case.  You can't do both. 
[00:15:30]  You can't suck and lose almost $12 million.  I don't even think it's about the $11 million, to be honest with you.  I think it's the fact that he's 7 and 17.  I mean, I think that's what it comes down to.  I mean, I guess that doesn't help.  It makes it a little easier.  So, and then in all the sports news, you got Roger Clemens denying that he ever took steroids  or human growth hormones.  And Mike Lupica, who's a great sports columnist, on the back of the Daily News, he writes,  Lupica to Clemens, don't tell us you're clean, tell them in Washington. 
[00:16:00]  Because Congress is going to be looking into this whole steroid thing.  And Mike's going, yeah, whatever, you can say whatever the hell you want.  I want to see you say it in front of Congress.  So, no one's believing him.  I know, and they probably shouldn't.  But you know what?  The bottom line is he pitched some great games.  So, I don't care.  I mean, if old Gooding Two-Shoes, Andy Pettit, is admitting to doing it twice, which means  he probably did it more.  Sure.  Come on.  Come on.  Roger didn't?  He's probably done it many, many times.  He probably knows that if he said twice, there's going to be a really loud laugh from everybody  who knows him.  So, he's either going to have to admit full-blown steroid use or just keep his mouth shut. 
[00:16:30]  He's basically going to say, I share my breakfast with my horses.  Of all the dramatic things, Roger Clemens, he's eating oats in George's box.  Who cares?  Honestly, I'm beyond caring.  At first, I kind of cared.  It was like, well, it's Bonds.  It's one guy going for the home run record.  But everybody in baseball is doing it, or most of them are doing it.  Let them do it.  No one made me laugh really hard this morning, though, talking about the steroids thing.  Good old Pete Rose. 
[00:17:00]  He's quoted.  I guess there's going to be an interview tonight or tomorrow night.  I forgot what paper it's in.  And he's just, oh, here we go.  Pete Rose thinks players who use steroids and other performance-enhancing drugs are making  a mockery of baseball.  The career hits leader banned by the sports for gambling weighed in on the Mitchell Report  in an interview with Dennis Miller that is slated to air.  Tonight, it says, air tonight night on Versus.  By the way, Dennis Miller's new show is really, really good if you want to check out something 
[00:17:30]  different.  I never thought anybody would make me look like an altar boy, Rose said.  I've been suspended 18 years for betting on my own team to win, he added.  I was wrong.  But these guys today, if the allegations are true, they're making a mockery of the game.  And of course, he finally admitted to betting on his own team to win in his autobiography  in 2004.  Pete Rose, of course.  If you're going to put these guys that supposedly did steroids into the Hall of Fame, I mean,  I've got to get a shot somewhere, he said.  So he's seeing his little land as far as trying to get into the Baseball Hall of Fame. 
[00:18:00]  And in a way, he's right.  I mean, the bottom line is, what he did was stupid, and it's the biggest thing in baseball,  especially because you're coaching a team and you can manipulate them to win if you  have money on the game, as opposed to taking a loss that won't hurt you.  Right, right.  But, you know, he didn't do anything that affected his play.  I mean, he didn't do anything that affected him getting over 14 years.  Oh, you should absolutely be in the Hall of Fame, without a doubt, especially now that  you know everyone's doing steroids.  And also, the more you know about other people's histories, whether it was Mickey Mantle's drinking 
[00:18:30]  or DiMaggio's abusing his wife, it's like everyone has these histories that are dirty.  Right.  All the greatest players in the game have dirty histories.  I mean, so if they're going to be allowed in, he should be.  It's obviously a personal thing with Rose.  Yeah, he's so pompous.  His numbers were just absolutely amazing when he was playing.  Let's go to Brad in Texas.  Brad, what's up?  Hey, this little Jimmy and Openie in the morning, Sports Talk Radio.  Sports Talk Radio.  We covered a few things so far.  Yeah, Sports Talk Extreme. 
[00:19:00]  All right, yeah, P-Rose, definitely the Hall of Fame.  You're all right, Brad.  Yeah.  We were going so well until I took this phone call.  Thank you, sir.  Let's go to Gail in Rockland County.  Gail, what's up?  Gentlemen, good morning.  Good morning, Gail.  Listen, I think Ann's chick did not do a really good job of wake up your spouse Wednesday today.  Yeah, it is wake up your spouse Wednesday, so.  Yeah, yeah.  Also, I was curious.  Is he driving the white Ford Bronco this morning? 
[00:19:30]  The white Ford Bronco.  What are you trying to do?  Gail, wait a minute, Gail.  What are you doing here?  Hold on, hon.  What are you trying to do, Gail?  What do you mean, hon?  Get to it.  You got to explain your little joke.  Hmm.  Let's see.  That was what?  About 15 years ago?  OJ?  Ah, Gail.  Ah, Gail.  Die.  Wow.  You're a little much.  Hey, the P-Rose interview was on last night. 
[00:20:00]  Maybe we could get some audio of that.  All right, we're just getting started.  It is Whip Him Out Wednesday.  It's Wake Up Your Spouse Wednesday.  Morning Zoo bit of the day Wednesday.  We might have to play that Scott and Todd roly-poly Christmas one more time.  It is the holiday season.  Well, you know.  And our phone number is 877-212-ON-A.  Jamie Lynn turned 16 in April, got pregnant in September, has a show on Nickelodeon called  Zoe 101.  My 10-year-old niece loves that show.  Now I'm going to start watching it.  Thank you, E-Rock.  Dirty girl.  Well, we had such high hopes for Britney's kid sister, but now, yuck. 
[00:20:30]  Is she a singer as well?  She's a multi-talented entertainer.  She's a little firecracker, too, this little dirtbag.  Didn't she scream at a bunch of people?  They were yelling, we don't like you here, Britney.  And she's like, F-you, screaming.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  She was sticking up for her sister.  I like her.  Big time.  Potty mouth.  Potty mouth.  She likes to bang.  She's a good girl.  The Zoe show is pretty popular with the 10-year-olds there.  You rock.  It was.  I don't know how popular it is now compared to the Disney stuff.  But it was huge for the longest time. 
[00:21:00]  Yeah.  What's the Disney stuff that's kicking it out of first place?  Hannah Montana.  What?  Hannah Montana.  It's all about Hannah Montana.  Nobody knows who she is.  Are you kidding, right?  Yes.  Oh, okay.  I know you're not totally at the pop culture, but that one you've got to know.  I only know her name because it rhymes.  Oh, okay.  If she walked in right now, I honestly wouldn't know who she was.  You wouldn't know.  Would I?  I think so, yeah.  What does she do?  She does that Billy Ray Cyrus show.  Well, Billy Ray Cyrus is her father, and they do a show for Nickelodeon together, right?  Is that really her name?  Called Hannah Montana. 
[00:21:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  And no one cares about Billy Ray Cyrus anymore.  It's all about his daughter, Hannah Montana.  What kind of a show?  Is it a variety show?  Is it a comedy show?  E-Rock, please help me for the love of God.  It's just another dumb kid show that the pre-teens like.  How old is she?  13, 14.  Oh, all right.  Wait till you.  All right.  I think she's older than that now, no?  Oh, whatever.  All right.  We're just getting started here.  When we get back, we have another death at Disney, and we also have a Santa getting groped 
[00:22:00]  at them all.  This story is hilarious.  And there is one I was saving for Ant, too.  Which one?  This is, actually, it's amazing that a story from his childhood has crept into today's  news.  Man reportedly beats seven-year-old boy for wearing pink nail polish.  Oh, on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Hey, this is Kevin Federline.  You're listening to Opie and Anthony.  Hi, good morning. 
[00:22:30]  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony Show.  Phone number 877-212-ON-A.  Also, let's not forget about ONARadio.com.  They're doing a great job as far as show rundowns and a lot of the visual things we talk about  on the show.  They link it up on ONARadio.com.  Anthony, in studio.  I feel like a guest.  I just came in.  Hi, how you doing?  I so wish that you would have come in at the end of the break.  And was it like, just tell him to come in after the break. 
[00:23:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Have me sit in the green room.  I don't know.  I was trying to stay in the car, but the phone wasn't working very well.  Just a cataclysmic breakdown of events.  I don't know what happened.  The alarm didn't go off.  And then I have three settings on my phone.  Three settings that I set every night.  So I have four chances of waking up.  And I don't know what happened.  The phone didn't work.  What a mess. 
[00:23:30]  What time is your fail safe with Kenny?  Because I have a fail safe with Kenny.  I have a fail safe with Than.  And he called.  But the phone, something happened with my phone.  It wasn't making noise.  And I didn't wake up.  I have a fail safe of 5.15.  At 5.15, I could still make it here on time.  What woke you?  Oh, I guess when Melinda got a call.  Oh, really? 
[00:24:00]  Yeah.  And her phone went like, meh, meh, meh.  And that woke me up.  Unbelievable.  Son of a bitch.  Language.  Oh, there's nothing worse.  You wake up.  You look at the clock and go, oh, there's no way I can make it.  There's no way.  We need a transporter for me to make it.  It happens.  All right.  Let's say hi to Kevin in California.  Kevin.  Can I plug one thing?  We have Ricky Gervais calling in.  Oh, yeah.  We haven't even mentioned that yet.  In about 11 minutes from the office and, of course, some extras. 
[00:24:30]  And he's doing gigs in New York.  I was asking you to do during the break.  Have you ever seen extras?  I've seen one episode and I loved it.  Yeah.  I have them all.  I'm almost.  What is this show about?  I mean, obviously a very different character than his office character.  He's still a douche.  Yes.  Yeah.  But he plays an extra in a movie, and it's a movie about the Holocaust, so it leaves a  lot of opportunity for some really politically incorrect things for him to do. 
[00:25:00]  Wait, is it about the same movie through the whole series or through the whole season?  From what I saw, all the episodes I saw, it was pretty much the same movie.  It's different movies?  The first couple episodes I saw was the Holocaust movie, which was really funny.  Yeah, I got to check it out.  I think I got season one box set.  He's so great, because the one I saw, I haven't watched it.  Honestly, I love Gervais so much that I hate watching everything that someone has and there's  nothing left.  I told you, The Office is one of my favorite shows of all time, and I still haven't seen 
[00:25:30]  that final Christmas special, because I don't want it to be able to.  Who are you waiting for?  I'm a dope.  We had him in studio.  I had a really uncomfortable moment with him, because he's talking about extras, and  I didn't really know about the show, and he's on our radio program, and I go,  oh, wow, what?  You're putting out an extras DVD for The Office?  He looked at me like, do you even know who I am?  Dude, that was one of the most uncomfortable moments of the last year, as far as this radio  show goes. 
[00:26:00]  But then you started, because you were a fan of The American Office, which was great, but  then you started watching the British version.  Oh, I was a huge fan of his version of The Office.  Yeah.  At first I wasn't, but the more you get into it, it's just amazing how great that is.  Yeah.  And so I really thought he was coming in to kind of milk that a little bit, and he found  some, I don't know, lost tapes or something, and he was promoting extras, meaning for The  Office.  Oh, boy.  I felt like such a douche.  Kevin, what do you got, buddy?  Good morning, bu-bu-bu-boys.  Hey.  Hey, I've been listening to you guys since Free Play Weekend on XM. 
[00:26:30]  Oh, nice.  Yeah, and at first, Jimmy, man, I hated you, right up until the last line of Wheelchair  Fred in the bathtub there.  Oh, really?  What was the last line?  Can we say it on this side?  Anybody else got a...  What?  You remember the whole...  We remember the bit.  What was the line that turned you around, as far as Jimmy goes?  Jimmy goes, does anybody else have a...  Blank, blank. 
[00:27:00]  Oh, okay.  Oh, okay.  I was implying that I was excited by Wheelchair Fred.  I got to blow you off.  We got Ricky Gervais on the line.  Ricky!  Hello.  How are you, sir?  There he is.  How's it going?  Good.  We were just talking about you.  Do you remember being on our show about six months ago, maybe eight months ago?  Of course I do.  I'm not that senile.  Okay, and I was just retelling the story where I felt like the biggest douche, because  when you came in to promote extras on DVD, I really thought you were talking about the 
[00:27:30]  English office, and you were putting out an extras box set that had something to do  with the English office, and you actually looked at me like, what is wrong with you?  I blanked that out.  Okay, good.  Good.  We just like to acknowledge uncomfortable moments on the show, so I just finally got  to acknowledge that we had that moment.  I missed the most uncomfortable moment.  What was all this about you had a tramp in, and he wanted to do things to our Queen of  England?  Oh, no.  A tramp.  A tramp. 
[00:28:00]  A tramp.  It was a guy we had on the, a homeless guy on the other side of the show, and he was  just a crazy person, and he was just talking about all women of power, and he mentioned  Conor Lisa Rice, and he mentioned the Queen of England, and he mentioned Laura.  Any women of power, he mentioned, because he was pretty much a psychopath.  We got in a little bit of trouble on that one.  That's lovely to know that you really know your demographic well.  It was kind of funny that this guy was historically pretty versed.  He knew, I think he mentioned Margaret Thatcher.  I guess that story made it over to where you're at, huh? 
[00:28:30]  Yeah, well, I was, didn't you get told off or shut down or something?  Yeah, we got shut down on satellite radio, but our regular radio show,  continued.  I like how nice that sounds.  A tramp.  A tramp.  Yeah, just picture some guy with the stick and the bandana tied at the end, with one of  those old hats and a little piece of stogie in his mouth.  No, it's a stinky homeless guy.  Well, that's what I mean.  I didn't know the politically correct term, but you sorted me out with a crazy guy. 
[00:29:00]  We were never allowed to defend ourselves as far as that whole thing went.  It was the rantings of a homeless guy, and the news just took like 15, 20 seconds of  that rant and made us look like complete a-holes.  Whoa, it's not your fault, is it?  No, we're not going to take blame.  Hey, Ricky, I'm really psyched you're coming back, because I know you're doing gigs.  It's called Ricky Gervais Out of England Tour.  Tickets are on sale now at Ticketmaster.  You're doing a July 12th gig in L.A. at the Kodak Theatre, and July 14th and 15th here 
[00:29:30]  in New York at MSG WAMU Theatre.  I've never seen your live act.  Well, I must warn people, I've only done one gig in New York.  I did it as part of the Highline Festival.  I don't know if you remember, back in May, David Bowie was curator at the Highline Festival,  and I did an hour show.  And I must warn people, if they saw that, there is no point in coming to this one, because  it's basically the same stuff.  I don't want anyone to turn up, I've been paid $50, and go, well, I've heard all this. 
[00:30:00]  How honest is that?  I always lie when I go out and do gigs.  I'm like, I'll be a lot of new stuff.  I never want to do the same thing twice, so this is basically, that was the warm-up for  this eventual tour, so it's a bit different, but I think it's for people who've never seen  me live, and they'd be delighted.  Well, you know what?  If someone came out and saw you last May, and then sees you, it's going to be over a  year since they've seen you, people can watch the same live act twice in a period of a year 
[00:30:30]  and still enjoy it.  I'll go back and watch some of the older Office episodes, and I still laugh.  If people see you two weeks later, that's a problem, but if somebody sees you a year  later, man, they're still going to enjoy it.  Yeah, but I pretended it was all ad lib.  Oh.  See, that could be the problem right there.  I remember that subtle chuckle he put in at the end of that joke.  Ricky, you bring up something that's pretty funny, though, because I've seen a lot of  comedians, and you sit in the audience and go, wow, he's just ad-libbing off the cuff. 
[00:31:00]  He's amazing.  And then you just so happen to see the same show a month later, you're like, that son of  a bitch.  It's all written.  I want to shout the punchline before I get to it.  Yeah, right.  We both have lived exactly the same routine.  Yeah.  But it's just funny to hear, like, you're just deconstructing yourself, which is like,  it's the exact same thing.  Well, you know, maybe people enjoy it twice.  They can't possibly.  They thought I made it up as I went along.  Yeah.  It was called the Ricky Gervais improv show.  Yeah.  I saw...  I'm sorry, go ahead. 
[00:31:30]  No, go out.  I love this plug.  Tickets are on sale.  No, I saw...  Yes, they are.  And I saw a moment of your act.  I lied, actually, online, because somebody said, wow, Ricky Gervais is doing stand-up.  It was a benefit for Diana.  I think it was at Wembley Stadium.  Oh, that wasn't my...  That was none of my stand-up.  That was me.  That was me basically floundering, because Elton John wasn't ready.  Were you...  Were you really...  The beauty of this is you were out there in front of a packed Wembley Stadium.  Yeah.  And it looked like you were floundering, but it also looked like... 
[00:32:00]  Is he floundering, or is this just like a Ricky Gervais thing?  Well, I was...  I wasn't floundering, because I didn't care enough.  But...  And I just sold about half a million tickets, so I didn't want to do stand-up.  So I...  So what I did was...  I bowed to peer pressure of 80,000 people screaming, do the dance.  So I did.  Yeah.  You made them wait, though, before you did the dance from the office, his horrendous...  Mm-hmm.  I just didn't want to do it. 
[00:32:30]  I just...  I don't want to be that guy that goes around in 10 years' time, and all poor people are  shouting, just do the dance.  I'll throw my back out.  I don't want to be...  I don't want to be paralyzed on stage.  I want to come out with intelligent adult humor.  Not do a dance, like a monkey.  Yeah, I mean, definitely.  When you put it like that, first...  Like a trained monkey.  Go ahead, dance.  Like a tramp.  Like a tramp.  Like someone who does tricks for smack.  But you were funny, though. 
[00:33:00]  Like, it was funny, because I felt like I was watching this thing that you do so well, which  is this kind of real weird tug-of-war with an audience, of, like, you're letting them  get away and think that you're losing it, and then you just pull them back with something  really funny, and I didn't know what that was that you were doing, but I thought it was  great.  Well, that's good, because one British journalist here who tried to start a backlash said that  he was rubbish, so was the office rubbish, it was overrated, extras was awful, this is  the end of his career.  That was in June.  Wow.  This is the end of his career. 
[00:33:30]  Well, no, it's not.  It's like something like that.  I mean, you've got to love that stuff, man.  But that's so easy to be proved wrong, isn't it?  Yeah.  It's like, you know, just say, he's rubbish.  Don't say, and this is the last you'll see of him.  Oh, there he is again.  It doesn't work.  How can anybody call the British office garbage?  I almost said rubbish, just so you'd like me, but how can anybody call it garbage?  It was one of the best shows ever done.  Well, this is why I phoned into this show, for an ego boost.  It's an amazing show, man.  I just watched the one again where the guy is in, the consultant is in again, and he's 
[00:34:00]  trying to help, and David just can't let the other guy be the star of the show.  That's my favorite episode.  That's my favorite ever episode.  And he's trying to prove, like, be the difficult thing, and he's like, no, we can't help it.  Oh, there's been a rape.  Yeah, I love that one.  That might be my famous look.  But don't go into rape again.  You'll get turned off the air.  Yeah, but a close second is the one with the boombox, the motivational speech, and you  give the speech, and you run out, and no one gives a crap.  Oh. 
[00:34:30]  Tina Turner's simply the best.  Yeah, that's a song to do it to.  I highly recommend it to the people out there that have never seen The English Office.  You've got to check it out.  You've got to.  It's a really weird work of all.  I thought it was going to be overrated, too, because I'd heard so much about it.  I'm like, all right, this is probably going to be a decent show that's overrated.  And I watched it, and I was blown away by how much I love this guy and how much you  made me cringe.  And I've never seen a better portrayal of a horse's ass than David.  It was really beautiful.  Thank you.  You almost feel sorry for him.  Yeah. 
[00:35:00]  He's such a tool.  You definitely feel sorry for you, Ricky.  Well, maybe NBC will show it, now the strike's on.  Wow, how cool would that be?  I feel 12 weeks.  That's a good idea.  That's a damn good idea.  Hey, are you going to pop up on The Office?  Well, yeah, I wanted to give it a lot of time, just because I thought it would be weird for  me to pop up.  And I really wanted them to find their feet, which they have.  But I think it'd probably be safe now.  But what I wanted to do was have The Office watching extras.  And Michael Scott would come along and go, yeah, I don't like this guy. 
[00:35:30]  When they do an American remake, I'll probably watch that.  But, yeah.  I saw you on YouTube.  They have you on one of the chat shows.  Oh, yeah.  And the guy pulls out an old video of your band, and you just look like you wanted to  reach over and choke him.  Yeah, but people think that I'm embarrassed about how I look then. 
[00:36:00]  No, I'm embarrassed about how I look now.  That just reminds me that I used to have a bone structure.  You were a lovely lad.  I know.  I was a lovely lady lad.  He had the big hair and everything, and you were so slender.  It was fine to wear too much mascara.  Yeah, it certainly was.  Did you guys have any success with that band?  No.  No.  No, not at all.  No, the thing is, things that come out after you're famous for something else. 
[00:36:30]  Now, it was, you know, we had a couple of singles out, but it was all over in six months,  and no one would have ever remembered it if it wasn't for the fact that I then, you know,  did something else sort of 15 years later.  Sure.  But, yeah.  Hey, a little known fact about you, you hold the Guinness Book of World Records for the  most downloaded podcast.  Eight million downloads.  Wow.  Yeah, I know.  It's crazy.  But I think that's like Alexander Graham Bell having the biggest phone bill ever.  Yeah.  There wasn't a lot of competition when we put that out. 
[00:37:00]  It was like a podcast had been like a year old.  Yeah.  No, I think you've still got the record, but, yeah.  Do you listen to podcasts?  Do you ever download podcasts?  I personally have not.  I mean, we're up on iTunes.  What's that?  Exactly.  But, again, though, because we're doing radio for five hours a day, so it's kind of like  jaded, but somebody who has to drive to work in the car and then go into an office and  has time may actually do that.  Well, I think that's what people did.  I think they listened to our stuff like, you know, on the subway and in their car and stuff. 
[00:37:30]  And, you know, Carl Pilkington became a little bit of an internet phenomenon.  I mean, he's a global village idiot.  I don't know.  Again, I don't know what the PC term is.  That's it.  He's an idiot savant, I suppose.  But, no, I think he captured the imagination of a lot of it, which is weird.  You know, the great thing about podcasting is it is global.  Anyone who's got a computer, you can – it's international, which is great fun, I think.  Well, it's amazing how years ago, like, you know, say five or six years ago, like when 
[00:38:00]  you talk about the internet, it seemed like a nice way to market something when, quote  unquote, legitimate marketing wouldn't do – wouldn't take care of you or legitimate  media outlets ignored you.  But now it's like there is – it's much easier to get famous almost online than it is  through legitimate television.  Well, I sometimes sit and watch YouTube, just put stuff in, you know, like silly cat  and funny dog and Carl Pilkington, and I just see what comes up because, you know, it is 
[00:38:30]  proper viewing, really.  It's just so vast.  I mean, it's crazy.  It's amazing where you find yourself, where you end up when you started out looking at  one thing and then you end up watching a video and you're like, how the hell did I  end up here?  It's so funny that all the same things sort of float to the top.  The famous, you know, everyone scene, you know, independently, there's one that's going  around at the moment with two cats talking, and it really looks like they're having a  little chat to each other.  It's just amazing.  I think animals are intrinsically funny. 
[00:39:00]  I don't know why cats have just – people have taken to cats on the internet in all forms,  websites and YouTube and everything.  People just like having cats in weird situations.  Well, this is what is good for the cat because the cat was never really – never really  hit a broke television.  It wasn't big in cinema, but now they can probably rule the world now with the internet.  Hey, Ricky, by the way, if you want to see – I'm going to give you a recommendation.  If you want to see a funny animal video –  Oh, boy. 
[00:39:30]  Don't talk about the otters.  It's called – no, no.  I hate the otters.  Hold your hands.  All right, good.  It's called Mr. Hands, and it's a gentleman being pulverized by a horse.  That's all I'm going to say.  Look it up, and you're going to have quite a laugh.  Being what?  By a horse?  Yeah, it pulverized.  Just Mr. Hands.  It's just something you wouldn't expect to see a horse and a gentleman doing.  Hold on one minute.  What a minute.  This is a recommendation.  Why on earth would I ever want to see that?  It's sexy.  It's funny.  It's got a little –  It's sexy.  No, it's not sexy.  Yes, it is. 
[00:40:00]  In Jim's world, it's very sexy.  Listen, I think you should be closed down for three months for even suggesting that.  And you could also check out Two Girls, One Cup.  I mean, it's one of our favorites.  I'm going to go and have a shower after this.  I feel so.  Yeah.  Never.  Dirty.  No.  No.  No.  Hey, would you ever tour with your band?  Because like we had John C. Reilly in the other day and it's like he had a band years  ago and now that he's a very famous actor, he's kind of – he's using it in a movie 
[00:40:30]  but you could tell he kind of likes being a rock star.  Would you ever actually bring that back and start doing gigs?  No, because for one reason and one reason only, I'm too fat and I'm embarrassed.  Really?  And he never rocked.  You see –  It was that new wave crap.  Being sort of short and fat and uncool is a big bonus for a comedian because you have  to be slightly worse off than the audience whereas a rock star has to be sort of above  the audience.  But I don't know. 
[00:41:00]  I think you'd be a little hard on yourself.  I mean, I think the fact that just to see you playing live music and kind of doing your  thing in that way, people would kind of overlook the obvious physical abominations.  I love the way that it started off fluttering.  That was great.  That was a real good sucker punch.  You were listening to that with such hope.  I was actually thinking, yeah, you know what?  I'm not that bad.  But you have a great – again, I'm sorry to keep going back to The Office. 
[00:41:30]  I know Extras is a massive hit but there's a scene in that – I think it's that same  episode with the guitar where you're singing songs.  Yeah.  And Dawn – I think her name was Dawn – gets upset at something and she's really upset  and you look at Gareth and go, get the guitar.  Yeah.  That's great.  Like it's time to straighten this poor deer out.  I love the idea that people think they can sort out people's lives with a song.  Yeah.  Just like Ebony and Ivory stopped all racism. 
[00:42:00]  It certainly did.  We can't get – yeah.  How do you guys feel over there about the whole Paul McCartney divorce?  I mean it's got to be – you know, you guys got to be sick to your stomach with Head  and Mills.  Yeah.  Well, I don't really get involved in Tittle Tattle but you've got to side with the Beatle,  haven't you?  Yeah.  You know, you've got to side with him.  There was this joke on a comedy award show where someone said this is the castle where  Sir Paul McCartney went down on one knee or Heather Mills as we call her. 
[00:42:30]  Oh, that's a good joke.  Oh, that is a gem.  That's a thousand to one shot in it when everything comes together for the perfect joke.  Yeah, that really is amazing.  I've made fun of her and I just go right for the barbaric angle but that's a clever,  clean, funny joke.  And let's not forget the season finale of Extras is what, Sunday on HBO? 
[00:43:00]  Oh, it was Sunday.  Last Sunday, aired last Sunday.  Oh, it just aired.  Yeah.  Yeah, it just aired.  I think it's every day this week, isn't it?  And then the DVD after Christmas.  Right, right.  Oh, yeah, I'd love you guys to see that.  I think you'll like it.  I think it's the best thing we've ever done.  So, yeah.  Do you know how rare it is, by the way, to have such a massive hit and then to follow  it up with a different massive hit?  I mean, it's amazing.  Normally, after somebody has – I mean, you look at MASH.  You know, those poor guys tried after MASH. 
[00:43:30]  It's just a dribble.  They tried after that brilliant series.  And here you are following it up with another giant hit on the same network.  Yeah, but I think the difference is it's not a giant commercial hit in America because  MASH was – wasn't that the biggest sitcom?  Didn't it get the 50 million?  Yeah.  But Ricky, there was only four channels back then.  Yeah, exactly.  Exactly.  Oh, I know, I know.  It's the same here.  You know, people used to get sort of like 25 million.  And now it's a hit if you get, you know, four or five.  Sure.  So, I think that we were never a Seinfeld or a friend. 
[00:44:00]  So, it was slightly easier for us to follow it up.  But it was never about being commercially large for us.  We just – we wanted the program to be good.  And we never really – we always said that we'd rather it be a million people's favorite  program than 20 million people's 10th favorite program.  Because the point of any art, even a lowly art like, you know, entertainment or television  is to make a big connection.  You want to make a big connection and, you know, have an effect. 
[00:44:30]  I mean, in your case, you got shut down for three months.  So, you had a vast effect.  Right.  I think that's it.  I think – and I genuinely believe that some people deserve to be offended.  And if you're not getting a reaction, then you're doing something wrong.  Yes.  I think it's important that people hate you as well as love you.  And you don't go out looking for that.  But if what you do is uncompromised and you're committed to it, some people are going to find  it horrible, offensive, and unfunny.  But you don't want to be in that middle ground.  You don't want people to say, yeah, it's all right. 
[00:45:00]  That's the worst.  Yeah, it was all right.  There's nothing worse than that.  So –  Yeah, it makes no impact on anybody either way.  Exactly.  You're – you have no effect on the world.  What do you – is there anything you – because I personally, as a comic, there's  things I hate in comedy.  Is there anything that just makes you sick to your stomach in comedy?  Loads.  Loads.  Um, uh, uh, catchphrases.  Um, getting a laugh out of props and silly wigs. 
[00:45:30]  People who say things like, do you remember the 70s?  Yeah, of course we fucking remember the 70s.  I saw one comedian come out and go, okay, everyone, what's this lyric?  And he's saying it, and they said, yeah, yeah.  And I was like, well, where's the comedy?  You're – what are you doing?  What are you doing?  You're asking people if they've got Alzheimer's or not.  No, they haven't.  Move on.  Oh, God.  No, there's loads of things, I think.  I don't like puns much.  Puns.  People who do – 
[00:46:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  – punny things.  Little wordplay jokes are kind of repugnant.  Yeah, exactly.  Um, although a guy – let me say, a guy that I think does a good job, even though he does  rely on a sight gag at one point, but he's really funny.  Eddie Izzard's a weird combination of a guy.  He went out and dragged, but I still watched his special.  I thought, wow, the material was really great.  Yeah.  Yeah, the problem with Eddie Izzard is that you sit in the front row, and he starts doing  some stuff, and you think, that man's got breasts.  It's like, you don't want any distractions. 
[00:46:30]  Oh, there's a man in a dress.  Yeah.  I mean, you know, again, at the risk of sounding NPC, I still find transvestites quite funny.  I like the ones that turn about the age of 50, and they go on a talk show with their  teenage sons and daughters who want to kill themselves, and they can't go to school anymore,  and they're sitting there in a dress, dressed like their auntie, and I've never felt so  comfortable.  They're still funny.  And they always pick the worst dress to wear, something your grandma would wear. 
[00:47:00]  They don't even know how to dress sexy as a woman.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Yeah.  Real frumpy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Why'd they do that?  I still, I still, I must admit, I still find transvestites funny.  And someone falling over in the street, I still find funny.  Especially if it's the same person.  An older man in a mini pearl dress just falling into a manhole is a hoot.  A 55-year-old ex-bank manager who gets his knickers caught on a car bumper, and he's dragged  along, screaming, I'm a man. 
[00:47:30]  And his pants are pulled down and his body is chafed.  Yeah, I hear you.  Look, we don't want to get you closed down again.  Are you doing the gigs now?  Obviously, let me just plug again here.  It's called a Ricky Gervais Out of England tour.  Tickets are on sale now at Ticketmaster.  It's July 12th in Los Angeles, the Kodak Theater, which is where they do the Oscars every  year.  It's a great theater, a great venue for a show.  And here in New York City, July 14th and 15th at the WAMU Theater at MSG. 
[00:48:00]  You can also go to Ricky Gervais, G-E-R-V-A-I-S dot com.  You don't even have to promote these gigs, Ricky.  They will sell out.  They're going to sell out.  I think they're well on the way, yeah.  I think they're nearly gone, actually.  But, you know, you want to...  Oh, so you're just calling to say hi.  I like that.  We like that.  I'm just going to hang out with you guys and catch up on what things you've done wrong.  I think...  The easiest thing is to go to RickyGervais.com because there might be other dates as well. 
[00:48:30]  I get the feeling that you enjoy our F-ups, Ricky.  Oh, I swore, and you said F-ups, and I swore.  Was that bad?  That's okay.  On XM, they heard it, but on the terrestrial radio side here, they dumped out of it, but  some of our audience still heard it.  It's all right.  It happened.  People slip onto it.  Oh, I apologize.  No worries.  No worries.  I do apologize.  We do it all the time.  No worries.  We slip.  I thought it was okay.  Oh, yeah.  I'm so sorry. 
[00:49:00]  Oh, people think I'm such a...  No, stop.  No, that's all right.  You just crawl up and use filthy language.  Potty mouth.  You were talking about donkeys.  It's a man.  No, no.  Donkeys would be queer.  It was a horse.  A donkey is a sap.  A horse is a regal, beautiful animal.  I know.  And they're not as stubborn, are they?  No, they're not.  Yeah, you don't have to push a horse very hard.  Just kind of smile at it.  It's hooves up. 
[00:49:30]  Hey, we got to take a break.  We got commercials and stuff.  But we're really, really psyched that you're coming back.  We'd love you to come in studio again, man.  I will.  An absolute pleasure.  I'll see you all soon.  Thank you.  You're brilliant, man.  We love you.  Cheers, man.  Thanks, Ricky.  Ricky Gervais, everyone.  Extras is going to be on again tonight, 8.30 on HBO.  I love that guy.  He's great.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hey, this is Ricky Gervais, and you're listening to my pal, Lil Jimmy Norton.  He's not my pal.  Hey, this is Jim Norton. 
[00:50:00]  My 2008 tour is on sale now on Ticketmaster.  In February, I'll be at Bananas in Poughkeepsie, Cobbs in San Francisco, and The Egg in Albany,  as well as the House of Blues in Cleveland.  In March, I'll be in Atlanta, Georgia, Inglewood, Colorado, Minneapolis, Minnesota.  Go to my MySpace for details and go to Ticketmaster.  Thanks.  I know nothing stays the same, but if you're willing to play the game, it's coming around again. 
[00:50:30]  Opie, Anthony, Jim Norton, in the house.  You got tickets for the New Year's Eve thing, Jimmy?  I would like to, as a special gift, we're going to give away two pairs of tickets, one  for each, one pair for each caller.  The prize pack includes a pair of tickets for my New Year's Eve show at the North Fork 
[00:51:00]  Theater in Long Island, a pair of VIP passes, and a pair of VIP parking pass, and one pair  of VIP parking pass.  So call in now.  Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  What about the cheesecake?  Well, that's what we're going to do after is we're going to go over to Etch A's Riley's.  A slice of cheesecake for everybody.  I need a cheesecake, yes.  Well, it's a slice of cheesecake for everybody if you pay.  You can't get free cheesecake.  No.  At Etch A's Riley's.  I will be getting free cheesecake there.  You will not.  I'm crazy.  I am special.  I'll be there.  Are you definitely going to come?  What?  Are you going to be in town?  What?  What?  I would like to if you came. 
[00:51:30]  What are you talking about?  New Year's Eve?  Yeah, Anthony's coming.  I'm there.  So there.  Anthony's not at my gigs as often, so I'll be happy if you're both there.  I'll be there.  Are you coming, Eron?  Let's go talk in a thin air again.  What, Eron?  I couldn't hear a word you said.  If I didn't hear it, they didn't hear it.  Are you coming to my New Year's Eve show?  Yes.  Good.  That's a boy.  By the way, there's a bunch of copycat cats out there.  They're doing the Cinnamon Challenge, and they're putting E-Rock in the search engine  on YouTube.  Now he goes there to check it out.  You're a star. 
[00:52:00]  People are following your lead.  I know you're not the first one to do it online, but people are following E-Rock's lead,  even though we said, don't try this at home.  Which is really stupid, by the way.  Why would they listen to us?  We saw someone almost die in front of us, and for the first time in our careers, we decided  to do the right thing and tell people not to do this, but they're doing it anyway, so  what the hell?  Owned by the Cinnamon Challenge, quality, whatever that means, in parentheses, and then it says  E-Rock.  They're just throwing E-Rock in the search engine so they get their views up.  They know what they're doing.  There's another guy doing it. 
[00:52:30]  It's no big deal.  The guy just doesn't get it done, and he doesn't choke like you.  No?  He's like a real man.  He's a man's man.  He doesn't breathe in the cinnamon into his lungs.  Well, he didn't have Bob Kelly dumping it right down his windpipe, either.  He swallowed it.  Yeah, he's probably going to...  No, he didn't really swallow it.  It goes on for a while.  Hey, let's say hi to Ian in Rochester, the home of Brother Weez.  What's up, Ian?  Hey, Ian.  Hey, Owen.  Hey, love you guys.  Love the show.  Thank you, sir.  Thank you.  You know, I just wanted to call.  I was so excited. 
[00:53:00]  I ran home last night from work, and I'm thinking, I've got to see this.  That Anthony thing on his iPod.  Oh, the podcast.  Firearms and his racial affinity for firearms.  Anywho, I get my girlfriend to look at the show, or to look at the thing.  Anthony starts going on, filling banana clips, talking about aiming Enfields, and talking  about how the shotgun is the best, because the rifle is causing collateral damages.  It's going through houses and hitting the neighbors. 
[00:53:30]  Man, she has lost all respect for me, and the kind of thing I do every day with driver.  So I come home, and I tell her how it's kind of an intellectual show.  You guys are smart.  You guys are cool.  Now she has just, she just has completely given up on me.  She thinks I'm crazy?  Well, you know, I just bought, I got a Mouser not too long ago, so I've got this rifle in  my house.  It's an antique weapon, you know, and it's cool, and it's fun.  And I had to, you know, I had to tell her, look, we live in the city, you know, and there's, 
[00:54:00]  just in case anything happens, we want something around, and I thought this was going to be  the selling point for the next step.  Oh, yeah, perhaps if you want to get a weapon for the house, you shouldn't show that podcast.  It's good advice, but I think after reviewing it myself, yeah, that could be a problem.  People, I don't know, people kind of, I'm surprised people have commented that I come off a little  crazy in that. 
[00:54:30]  I would say this, I don't mean to interrupt you, sir, but I haven't even seen the podcast  yet.  You can go to laszlo.com and see it.  With a W, by the way, people are getting confused.  L-A-Z-L-O-W.  Dot com, yeah.  But I just know Anthony, and the way he talks about guns, he probably talks about guns in  the same erotic tone that I would talk about pornography, and that's probably where the  creepy part comes in.  I read your book, Jimmy, you're absolutely right.  The guy's sitting there, he's got a cocktail in his hand, and he's very matter-of-factly,  and the whole time I'm doing this, my girlfriend's watching over my shoulder, and I'm horrified, 
[00:55:00]  and I'm thinking, well, at least he's not aiming the guns.  Oh, God, he's aiming the guns.  He starts aiming the guns.  I'm thinking, oh, my God, you know, and I really look up to you guys, and I think you  guys are really cool guys.  Anthony, you really came off kind of crazy there, man.  Yeah, maybe a little bit.  I can't wait to see the next one, guys.  You guys are great.  I'll talk to you later.  Thank you, sir. 
[00:55:30]  Say hi to Brother Wheeze for us when he's out and about in town there.  We got a mall Santa.  This is probably the story of the day.  This guy, he's been the mall Santa for years.  He's like 65, 68 years old, and some lady comes crutching over, sits on Santa's lap, and  then starts groping him.  And Santa's not too happy about this, which surprised me.  I thought most Santas would be happy if a woman was on his lap of groping his junk. 
[00:56:00]  Yeah, but I was going to try to make a Christmas ball joke there, but then figured we would  get dumped out.  But, yes, she started groping him.  Groping his, oh, my God, what are they called?  The things that hang on the tree.  Yeah.  Christmas.  Oh, how about this?  Groping his tinsel and ornaments.  Well, did he rat her out, or did somebody see it?  He ratted her out, but I think his wife's involved with this whole thing, so he's the Santa Claus, 
[00:56:30]  and I think the wife takes the pictures, and so maybe she said, you've got to say something  about this.  Of course.  Because why else would you say something?  Yeah, I mean.  Getting a quick grope.  If somebody's grabbing your presents.  You know.  Hey, don't grab my stocking full of coal, honey.  She groped his stocking stuffer.  Steven S. from Bayshore.  Here's the news story.  Well, a shopping mall Santa got more than he bargained for with an X-rated wish list. 
[00:57:00]  The 65-year-old Chris Kringle says he was taking Christmas wishes at the Danbury Fair  Mall in Connecticut when a woman sat on his lap and then groped him.  Police quickly arrested 33-year-old Sandra Lamey, who couldn't get too far.  She was on crutches.  A fellow Santa was shocked to hear what happened.  It's something that should not be ignored, nor should it be something that you condone  or laugh.  Oh, another goody-two-shoe Santa.  Shut up.  There's plenty of guys out there that are playing Santa at malls going, God, I wish it 
[00:57:30]  was me.  Yeah, it can't be.  Don't show my face on camera, but I really wish this was me.  Why would you want to be groped?  I mean, considering you're basing children on your lap all day, that's not creepy, but a  woman gropes you, and you have her arrested.  Right.  Right.  Good point, Jimmy.  Ew, a grown-up.  Right.  No.  Mall Santa should be executed.  Ew.  Ew, a grown-up with the wrong parts.  Yuck.  Yuck.  Yucky.  Nor should it be something that you condone or laugh or chuckle about. 
[00:58:00]  Santa is a family kind of guy.  Lamey insists she didn't do anything wrong.  She's been charged with sexual assault and is due in court next month.  Did you hear the woman in the back?  Relax.  So maybe something weird happened?  Hopefully.  She was just naughty.  Oh, she's not getting any presents this year.  Shut up.  She was just naughty.  The ad-libbing news people.  Looks like she's going to get coal in her stocking this year. 
[00:58:30]  All sorts of awful Christmas jokes that have no laughter.  Yeah, she's not going to get any presents.  That's what she said.  Right.  Who's laughing at all?  No one.  Dribble.  News people ad-libbing.  It would have been funny if she said, I bet he wanted to choke her with tinsel.  That would have been kind of funny.  Punch her in the, and then the worst word you could use.  Bank account.  Why don't we get this mall Santa on the show?  Have we tried? 
[00:59:00]  We should try calling him and see what that's about.  And now we go to another death at Disney.  Wow.  Another death at Disney.  The happiest place on earth.  Yeah.  Boy, that place is becoming, you're choking up quite the body count.  It's like the nom.  It's like the Ted Offense.  I was just saying.  Yeah.  Fallujah.  What's the website, E-Rock?  Death at Disney.com or something like that?  Yeah.  You know, because Disney, they like to hide the fact that people die at their park, so 
[00:59:30]  they kind of hose it down.  We've done this a million times.  They hose it down, and then they reopen the ride, and hope no one noticed the body bag  being brought out of the park.  They put the little wooden Mickey up that's waving and says, sorry, this ride closed for  maintenance or something.  Yeah.  But they're going to get to the point where they're going to have to make like, I don't  know, see Goofy dressed as an undertaker, all wacky, wooden sign as they carry out a  small little casket. 
[01:00:00]  And what they mean by closed for maintenance, they're in there scrubbing blood off the seat  so they can grab your money.  There's a hearse with mouse ears on it.  Yeah.  Right.  But what is the website for the people that have never checked it out?  Because they just list all the crazy crap that has happened at Disney.  A lot of people have died over the years.  Here's the latest one.  A death at Disney.  A man was unconscious after riding the Mount Everest roller coaster at Animal Kingdom and  was later pronounced dead.  Eric Von Anken is...  Oh, it sucks about this. 
[01:00:30]  Now they've got to slow the ride down for everybody else.  He probably had one of those heart attacks because he wasn't in proper health, and now we  all have to suffer.  The G-Force has got him.  Now it's going to be a slower ride for everyone else.  And was later pronounced dead.  Eric Von Anken is live at Disney World with some more on this breaking news.  What happened, Eric?  And, Bubs, this is the Expedition Everest ride at Animal Kingdom.  Remember, it's a newer ride at Disney, a roller coaster.  The sheriff's office telling us that the cameras that they put in place on the ride to capture  your picture, your picture. 
[01:01:00]  Well, 50 seconds before the ride ended, the camera captured this man, conscious.  He was unconscious when the ride pulled into the unloading area.  He was tended to by paramedics immediately and pronounced dead at Celebration Hospital.  Disney right now, they're told, is assisting the family in any way they can.  What do you call their hospital?  Celebration Hospital.  How can you call a hospital Celebration Hospital?  It's wonderful.  How about just a very plain name?  Just call it Hospital. 
[01:01:30]  Yeah, the Hospital.  The Hospital.  Celebration Hospital.  What are you celebrating when you go to the hospital?  How funny is that?  Celebration Hospital.  What diluted?  You know the visual I got?  You're on that ride and you're a little freaked out because you're not into roller coasters,  right?  So you're freaked out and you're turning to the guy next to you for a little comfort.  You know, when you look toward other humans for comfort when you're in a weird situation  and there's dead guy with his eyes open and his mouth agape.  That would be creepy.  Oh, my God.  Roller coaster dead guy. 
[01:02:00]  Roller coaster dead guy.  Celebration Hospital, they brought him to.  That's good.  Make your own jokes.  That's an easy one.  It's so awkward where they have to do the confetti and put on the party hats when they  know the guy's dead, but they have to because it's part of the ritual.  Right.  They play that awful cool in the gang song with...  As your family's trying to cry with dignity.  There you go.  Oh, poor guy. 
[01:02:30]  Yeah, but obviously he had a bad heart to begin with.  I mean, you know.  Yeah.  One guy dies.  If 18 people died on the ride, they should probably slow it down.  But, you know, if one guy drops dead, that's what you have to do.  Well, they have a problem with that mission space ride, too.  That one is like a centrifuge you're in.  So you could feel like G-forces, and you get that illusion of the video that you're watching,  and then the force is playing on your body, and it really feels like you're accelerating really quickly.  Are you spinning in a circle or no? 
[01:03:00]  Yeah, you're spinning, but your back is to the centrifuge.  So you're kind of pointing, you're facing the middle of this pivot, and then you're spinning on that,  so you feel pressure pushing your back in the seat.  Yeah.  They should maybe let some scientists look at some of these rides before they open it up to the public,  because I'm thinking back in the day, they're like, ah, what could possibly happen?  The Dumbo ride.  How fast is that going?  And then they look into it, and that centrifuge ride, your organs are pretty much being pushed to the back of your body cavity. 
[01:03:30]  I don't think that could possibly be a good thing for you.  He went from Celebration Hospital, they took him to Mission Morgue, which is a little ride there, too.  He slides you in.  Wait, wait, wait.  It's like the alpine slide.  It's all cold, and then you end up in a freezer.  Hey, Celebration is the name of the town, by the way.  That's fine.  That Disney made up, but you shouldn't call it Celebration Hospital.  It should just be hospital. 
[01:04:00]  Do people die on that mission ride?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  They've had a couple people die.  Kids, too.  A little kid died on that one.  By falling in the middle of it?  No, just some kind of physical thing.  They had to slow that down, too, because it was a little too much G-force on people during takeoff.  Oh, you feel like you're taking off?  Yeah, you feel like you're being pushed back in your seat.  Like you're smashed back in your seat.  Are you sitting or standing?  You're sitting.  Well, some of those rides, you're standing.  Yeah, some of them, yeah. 
[01:04:30]  In the old school, you would stand there and just be, you know,  pushed up against the wall, and there's a pit in the middle that you're scared that you're going to fall into.  Oh, people threw up a lot?  Yeah.  Yeah.  They had to delay the ride because somebody threw up before we went on it.  Oh, God.  And that'll come right back in your face.  Yeah.  Hey, by the way, you can go to findadeath.com, and there's a selection on Disney deaths,  and that link will be up on onaradio.com later today.  What was that other thing?  Oh, we'll promote that going into break.  Eric in Jersey, what's up? 
[01:05:00]  Hey, just want to let you guys know, if you notice, they said that this guy was pronounced dead at the hospital.  Yeah.  That's why Disney keeps claiming that this guy's in the park, because they drag them out before they're pronounced dead.  Oh, no.  We've done our research on Disney.  They don't want anyone officially dying on their property,  so they will not pronounce you dead until you're off the property.  Unless that has changed.  We read that back in the day.  Yeah, I would think they don't want people dying there.  They don't want people officially dying at the happiest place on Earth,  so they wait until you're in the parking lot or something, and then they call it. 
[01:05:30]  Thank you, sir.  Let's go to Peter in Glen Cove.  Please keep the corpse away from the closing doors.  It's a funeral after all.  It's a funeral after all.  That's got to suck, man.  Save up all your change for many, many years to go down to Disney,  and one of your family members dies.  Do you continue?  I mean, you've got the hotel.  Do you stay there the next day or two?  Yeah, what do you do?  You hang out, finish your vacation. 
[01:06:00]  And convince yourself he would have wanted us to.  Yeah, right.  That famous thing.  He wanted it this way.  That's the thing that makes us all go on with our lives.  He would have wanted it that way.  That would be cool.  No, he would want to be alive.  Someone was suggesting that they bury all the dead people in that little yard in the Haunted Mansion where the tombstones are.  It's probably real people.  Bury them there.  Bury them there, sure.  Is Haunted Mansion scary at Disney?  No. 
[01:06:30]  It's not?  If you're a kid.  The scariest part is at the beginning when they shut the lights out and the room stretches.  And then they shut the lights out and you look up and there's somebody hanging by the neck up there.  And it looks really creepy.  And that's where all the kids scream and I laugh.  Because screaming, crying kids just crack me up.  It's wonderful.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's go to Chris and Buffalo.  Can I interrupt?  Yeah, go ahead.  Because Stan said something about that.  You cried?  Really?  I thought he was just making a joke.  Stan.  Sweet, Stan.  I cried as a youngster on the old Haunted Mansion. 
[01:07:00]  What part got you?  Were you scared or did Mother try to hug you?  Mother.  Yeah, how is Mother?  I'm in a mess, too.  I don't know.  It's her birthday today, actually.  Did you send a card?  Why would I do that?  What's the gain in it for me?  He sent her a ticket to Disney to go on that ride.  We have to do a show dedicated to all our mother problems.  Mother.  Because I don't think you're the only one that has issues with mother. 
[01:07:30]  So what part of the haunted house got you?  It wasn't even any.  It was just when the chair turned around and started going backwards down a ramp.  Oh, that one got you?  Yeah, I started bawling.  Aw.  You just assumed there had to be some kind of malfunction at that given moment, right?  Yeah.  That had nothing to do with the situation you were in.  I know the part you're talking about, the one where you get and it brings you to the  outside portion.  Yes.  Where the guy's with the dog and the shovel, and he's digging a grave. 
[01:08:00]  But you just didn't like the feeling of...  Maybe it was a flashback to mother trying to take me out with a minivan in my youth.  I don't know.  I took a swing.  Take you out with...  You know, backing down a boat ramp.  Oh, I got it.  You bring back a little memory for me there, Than.  I cried at Howe Caverns.  Howe Caverns is in upstate New York, and you take an elevator down, like, I don't know,  two, three hundred feet, and then there's all these little tight little tunnels, and  there's those things that hang from the ceiling, and those things that come up from the ground, 
[01:08:30]  and there's like...  Like types of lagmites.  Yeah, and there's those mineral things, like lots of minerals around, and at the end of  this thing, you're squeezing through really tiny crevices and stuff, and you're already  aware that you're two, three hundred feet underground, and there's only an elevator back up, possibly  maybe a staircase if the elevator fails, and you get in a little canoe, and they take you  for a little canoe ride down this little underwater river, and then it stops because there's like 
[01:09:00]  a wooden fence, and they turn off the lights, and then basically tell you that on the other  side of this is just like emptiness, and just drops down for like ever, to the center  of the earth, and they let you sit there in the dark and think about that for a moment.  Think about it.  Which would be fine if you were like over 13, 14 years old, but when you're a kid, that  horrified the hell out of me.  Freaked you out.  It's like a bottomless pit.  Oh, yeah.  I was like, just turn the effing lights back on, all right, and stop messing with us.  It's a stupid canoe ride.  Not, well, when you get closer to the wooden fence, you just see this darkness on the other 
[01:09:30]  side, because it's lit up nice before that, but this is as far as the canoe goes, because  I guess it's like an underground waterfall, I don't remember, it's been a while since I've  been there, and then they just stop you in the canoe, and for dramatic effect, they turn  the lights off, and you're 300 feet underground, and now it's pitch dark, and you're aware that  on the other side of this is not a good thing.  A wooden fence doesn't sound very sturdy, could they have meddled it up a little?  Yeah.  It's just like a, yeah, like just a wooden fence.  And it's probably ancient.  But a couple, oh, yeah, it was probably built a hundred years ago or something. 
[01:10:00]  But that made me cry fancy, I'm with you.  All right, good.  I was, I was 18.  I cried when my grandmother took me to Coney Island on the cyclone.  And she was, God bless my grandmother, she was probably 65, and she and I went on that  roller coaster together, and I wept like a wash woman.  Really?  I wept, and there was a black guy and his son in front of us.  No.  Yes.  In front of us.  At Coney Island?  In front of us.  Wow. 
[01:10:30]  In the seat in front of us, and he was calming me down, which was, it's going to be all right,  it's going to be all right.  I was, I was blubbering.  That bad?  I was not always this picture of masculinity.  You see that his legs crossed the next to you.  Feminine glasses.  Feminine fashion.  Let's say hi to Tom in Florida.  We've got to take a break, but Tom, what do you got?  Hey, guys.  I wanted to tell a little Jimmy happy birthday.  Thank you very much.  No problem, no problem.  I'm an EMT, and what the stories we heard was, like, if you continued CPR, they were technically 
[01:11:00]  still alive.  So what happens is, they'll do CPR in the theme park, so they're still alive, and then they'll  call you, they'll pronounce you dead at the hospital.  So you're technically still alive.  Right.  In Pirates of the Caribbean, it's CPR.  Hey, Warren from Connecticut, he's with me.  I was, like, four or five at Howe Caverns, and I screamed my head off. 
[01:11:30]  Yeah, it's a creepy thing if you're a kid.  It's not that much fun.  That sounds scary.  Let's go to Kyle in Jersey.  Kyle.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  I was wondering, do they use Disney dollars for a funeral?  By the way, I...  Paid for a Disney dollar.  Yeah.  I read something, and I'm hoping, Eric, what does that say, please, at the very bottom  of that paper?  And this is the radio tease, by the way, because we've got to take a break.  So this is what E-Rock wrote.  Go ahead.  You did write that.  I cried at a Sha-na-na concert. 
[01:12:00]  Hand in your resume today.  I'm resume.  Hand in your...  Hand in your resume, yes.  So we can forward it to the next company.  Yeah, exactly.  Wow.  Really?  All right, you'll tell the story next.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Go.  Let's go right back to the phones.  877-212-ON-A.  Listening to Opie and Anthony.  We've got a guy that used to work at Disney. 
[01:12:30]  It's J.R. in California.  J.R., what's up?  Hey, this is J.R. over here in San Diego.  Hey, J.R.  I used to work at Disneyland in Anaheim, California.  Okay.  And there was a guy that, I mean, a girl that was on the ride and she was wearing sandals.  And you know them guys that walk around with a big stick and have balloons tied to it and strings and all kinds of stuff for their balloons?  Yeah.  Well, there's a metal plate on top of that stick.  It was a long stick.  And when the ride started going in circles, it was a swing with chains attached to it. 
[01:13:00]  When it started going in circles, the guy was close to the fence.  The guard, the guard barrel, I guess, whatever you want to call it.  And for some reason, he leaned back.  Well, he let the stick fall back.  And that's when the ride was spinning around.  And it chopped off the toe and I was right there.  She was wearing sandals.  And there was blood all over the place.  You saw a toe come off?  Yeah, I was right there.  I saw it happen.  And then I saw right away they stopped the ride. 
[01:13:30]  And I saw the blood pouring out.  And I could see the toe.  Yeah, but that's an easy one.  You could just, like, you know, sweep it into a bush or something.  No one will know.  No, but you know what they did with it?  Let the rats nibble on it.  One of those guys come by with the broom and the shovel really quickly.  Like they are whenever any garbage is in Disney.  And just sweep up the toe.  Yeah.  And then business as usual.  Yeah.  You know what they did with the toe, though?  What?  They called it a toe trip.  You did not do the toe truck bit. 
[01:14:00]  I didn't hear what you said.  You did not just do the toe truck bit.  Did he think that was going to just be a hit?  Are you effing kidding?  Call back so we can make fun of you.  You don't do the toe truck joke and then just hang up.  Hang up.  We fell for it, though.  We certainly did.  Call them morning ears.  We do with that crap.  The toe truck joke.  Wow.  Toe truck.  Uh, Jesse.  Shut up.  From Long Island.  What's up?  Hey, um, I don't know if you guys went on the, uh, encounter ride. 
[01:14:30]  I don't know if it took it down, but I went on when I was like eight.  Yeah, it's very scary.  I, I thought I was going to have a heart attack.  That was the scariest moment of my life when I was.  What was the problem with the alien encounter ride that made it so scary?  Well, the alien, like, it's in this tube and then it makes you like panic.  The glass breaks.  The thing.  She's, she's describing it like if it's a 911 call and she's all confused.  There's a tube and the alien.  You sit in this, uh, uh, theater setting pretty much in the round and, uh, you sit in these 
[01:15:00]  special seats and these things come over your shoulders to kind of hold you down.  The ride doesn't move at all.  Really?  The seats kind of bump up and down, but then in the middle, it's supposed to be some kind  of transporter thing.  And they're supposed to transport this nice, uh, uh, cuddly thing, uh, into the middle,  but, uh, the signal gets mixed up and they get this huge alien and he busts out and the  lights go completely dark.  And this thing that came down over your shoulders actually has things in it. 
[01:15:30]  Like it blows air into your ear and you, and it has speakers.  So you'll hear like,  and feel hot air going to you down your neck.  Like this thing is right behind you and you kind of get the illusion and this weird feeling  like this big monster's behind you ready to grab you.  And, uh, somebody in front of you gets killed and the, there's this spray of water that feels  like blood goes all over your face. 
[01:16:00]  Uh, and it's pitch black.  So the kids that are in there again, get horrified.  They're crying.  And again, hysterical, funny, you just got to laugh at crying children.  Why can't you understand as a kid that it's just an illusion?  It's an illusion.  All of a sudden there's real aliens that in a ride that is all about aliens.  Yeah.  I think the creepiest part is the guy that was hosting it on the TV screen was that pedophile  from, uh, Ferris Bueller's day off the principal. 
[01:16:30]  Oh, Jeffrey Jones.  Ugh.  Yeah.  Old, old file trade partners with Pee Wee.  Yes.  Old bug eyes.  He's a naughty boy, that Jeffrey Jones.  Certainly is naughty.  Naughty boy with very exotic tastes.  Yeah.  All right, Jesse.  Thank you.  No wonder.  You want this gig at Disney?  Yes.  Yes, I do.  Where do I apply?  The three applicants ahead of him wound up mysteriously dead.  Yeah.  Oh, I guess we got to hire you.  Uh, there should be a website dedicated to rides that we used to do when we were younger 
[01:17:00]  that are now like not happening because they realize how ridiculously dangerous they are.  I bet you there has to be a website like that somewhere.  But, uh, before you find that, E-Rock, why don't you tell us why you cried at Shauna Na?  Yeah.  What the hell is that?  Um, I was about three years old.  What were you, the promoter?  And, uh, my dad liked them.  So we went to their concert.  I was three years old and I guess we had aisle seats and this guy Bowser came over and started 
[01:17:30]  singing to me.  I started screaming and panicking.  Stupid Bowser with his big mouth.  Did he open his big mouth and make his muscles in front of you?  Yeah.  And that scared you?  He was leaning in with the mic while he was singing and all you hear is me screaming in  panic.  And that led you to overeating.  No, that was later.  He just saw how far a mouth could open and he's like, I could put food in there.  Yeah, if I open my mouth as wide as he does, man, what I could get in there. 
[01:18:00]  That must have been something for Bowser, though.  Like, wow, my career's going great.  I'm singing and this little kid's crying at me.  And he had the worst muscles.  He didn't have muscles.  No.  Why are you showing off muscles if you don't have muscles to show off?  Yeah, what a dumb...  Was that like a goof of a guy or did you really think he was good?  I think so.  There.  Shot on a...  Here they go.  All right.  The oddest thing, Sean and I at Woodstock.  They were at the original Woodstock. 
[01:18:30]  Were they?  Yeah.  How long have they been around?  Really out of place.  I don't know.  Since the mid-60s, somewhere around there, yeah.  What'd they do, just all 50s covers?  I don't know.  I don't know if they did originals, but they were completely late to the party as far as  the 50s music went.  But they were one of the biggest bands from that era?  I think it was a goof.  It was a goof band, I think.  I don't know.  They have a show.  We don't really need to talk about dumb Sean and I.  I'm obsessed with Sean and I.  I like Bowser.  Find some Sean and I facts for us, Iraq.  That's right. 
[01:19:00]  Bowser stinks.  Hey, where's Travis?  He knows a little bit about football.  What was this Michael Vick tribute?  Because now you've got five Falcons that got, what, fined and suspended?  Are they suspended?  Good for them.  I like the fact they did this.  Yeah.  What was the story?  They yelled the N-word into the camera.  No, after they scored a touchdown on Sunday, one of them underneath their jersey had a  black shirt on that said, free Michael Vick. 
[01:19:30]  And they lifted up their jersey.  So the camera showed that.  And that falls under, you know, it's illegal to wear something under your jersey.  Oh, they found a rule that they broke.  And then some of them put that, uh, put that face stuff, you know, the anti-glare or whatever.  Yeah, they had like messages to Vick on there.  Oh, wow.  Like what?  I don't know.  I think it's like his name, his number.  They're insane.  Of course he should go away for a little while.  Yeah, that's what.  Maybe not.  How long is he going away for? 
[01:20:00]  Two years.  Yeah, he'll do half that though.  That's a long time.  He'll miss one football season and then he'll come back and he'll be just, uh, well, they're  starting to say that he won't come back as a quarterback.  I don't think he will, no.  Why?  I, I, quarterbacks have, have, you know, short shelf lives to begin with.  They have short shelf lives because they get hit a lot, but if you're in jail and all you're  doing is working out, I think he's going to come back, uh, in shape.  I think it's going to be hard for a team to take him.  I don't know about that because what happens, maybe after jail, because when the offensive  line bends over, they'll just go from one to the other.  We, uh, we know a couple NFL players and, uh, the guy I'm talking about is still playing, 
[01:20:30]  but he, he, he's told me some stories about how strict the NFL is with, uh, with everything.  Well, how many years has he played?  Yeah, they're one of the strictest, strictest, uh, strictest, uh, leagues.  How many years has he played?  Four or five.  He absolutely can come back, especially, you got guys that play.  Oh, I think physically he can come back.  I don't, I don't know if a team's going to attack him.  He can come back as a utility player or something like that.  He could, I mean, you know, he was a Russian quarterback, so he could come back as, you  know.  I think it's awesome they're sticking up for him, but I mean, the guy, you know, he's 
[01:21:00]  got to go away for a little bit.  He deserves to go to jail.  He can't, like, strangle dogs and drown them and stuff.  Drown them.  It'll haunt him his whole career, but he will come back.  He'll come back probably as a backup for somebody, just to ease him in so people can't go too  crazy, and they'll protest and go, look, the guy was convicted, he did his time, he  paid the penalty, that's what America's about, we're not going to stop him from, he'll  come back, I guarantee it.  Yeah, I think so, too.  Aren't there people that do horrific things to animals and don't get jail time like that,  though?  That's an odd thing.  I think his personality might have... 
[01:21:30]  His was way over the top.  Yeah, but there are people that do, like, really cruel, just horrid things to animals  just out of pleasure.  To one cat or one dog, though, this was like...  He was financing the whole thing.  Yeah, this was a...  Yeah, okay, it was like a...  This was a killing field for dogs.  Whatever.  I don't think he should have got two years, but...  Uh, someone else that cried a shot or not, it's Nicole in Jersey.  Nicole, what's up?  Oh my God, when I was growing up and the show was on TV or whatever, Bowser used to make 
[01:22:00]  me cry.  Bowser would make you cry?  Why, hon?  I don't know.  I just...  I would cry.  I would wake up in all the night with nightmares.  I cried all the time.  It was awful.  I hated that joke.  No one liked Bowser opening his mouth like that.  No one liked Bowser.  I liked Bowser.  No one.  Who would like Bowser?  I thought he was cool when I was a kid.  No, you didn't.  I did.  I swear.  I was young.  I wanted to be Bowser.  I thought he was on hot stuff.  You're an ass.  Of course I was an ass.  He's on my list of why is this guy famous.  Yeah.  Like, because you can't really figure it out.  And he's still famous. 
[01:22:30]  Most people would not be able to give you an answer why he's famous.  Another one on that list is Tom Arnold.  Why is he famous?  Roseanne.  And why is he still famous?  He's a talent.  Oh, wow.  Tell me some video, Bowser Hawk.  Let's go to Max in Dallas.  Max, what's up?  Yeah, what's going on, boys?  Thanks.  You think E-Rock seeing Bowser led him to start wearing all the kids' t-shirts?  Oh, you think he got that fashion statement from Bowser? 
[01:23:00]  E-Rock's been known to wear a tight-fitting shirt.  Yeah, he usually did.  Do the Bowser pose there, E-Rock.  Max, you're usually pretty good for our show, but today you just had a bomb.  You trapped the bed.  It happens.  Don't feel bad about it.  You call back tomorrow.  Get back on that horse.  We love Max.  We'll get beneath that horse.  Get back under it.  Let's go to Chris in Jersey.  Hooves up.  Hooves up.  I love when you said that before.  Hooves up.  Chris? 
[01:23:30]  Hey, what's going on, boys?  Hey, the thing about Michael Vick is that it's not if a team's going to touch him.  It's a matter of the commissioner is going to let him back.  I guess with gambling or like with Pete Rose, he got suspended indefinitely.  No, they're going to let him back because he's doing his time, man.  They weren't able to really do anything with Pete Rose.  Pete Rose never did time for his crime.  But this guy's actually going to jail and doing his thing, so they're going to have to let him back.  All right.  That's my opinion.  I could obviously be wrong.  Who knows? 
[01:24:00]  But that's what I'm thinking.  All right, Chris.  And then in other football news, the fans voted Sean Taylor to the Pro Bowl, which is, I guess, nice for his family or something.  I don't know.  Who is he?  Oh, the guy who passed away.  Why?  Were those votes done before he was shot?  No, no, no.  But he's like, he can't play.  Yeah, why would...  That's not a little honorary.  Nice.  Well, he was...  Posthumous.  He was one of the better players in the...  I'm sure he was great, and he died in a horrible, very unfair way. 
[01:24:30]  Yeah.  People checking out Anthony's podcast on laszlow.com, L-A-Z-L-O-W.com.  Thank you.  And because of that, we're getting a lot of gun commercials coming in.  Here's one for, I think it's Don's Guns.  Hi, folks.  This is Don from Don's Guns, where the Second Amendment is live and well.  I'm standing in the rental department.  Want to shoot a .50 caliber Desert Eagle?  Want to shoot a Glock?  Want to shoot a high-powered rifle?  You can rent them. 
[01:25:00]  They're $10 to rent.  That's all it is.  Come on in.  Rent the gun of your choice, because I don't want to make any money, folks.  I just love to rent guns.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  All right.  That guy sounds a little crazy.  Wow.  There you go.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Yeah.  Certain states have these places.  You can just go down there, plop down some money, grab whatever you want, and fire away.  You won't find that in New York.  No.  For sure. 
[01:25:30]  John in Rosedale.  John?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  What's up with Flip-Flop Dopey, man?  What's happening here?  One second.  He's Michael Vick's not coming back.  No one says three words.  And I am.  Maybe he will be.  Maybe he will be.  Wait, I can't.  I'm sticking to your guns there, Oak.  Wait, what did I?  I can't really hear what you're saying.  You're saying that you flip-flopped because I said that Michael Vick will come back.  But I don't think you did.  I think I.  Oh, absolutely.  Absolutely.  Wait, I.  After the playback.  Hold on.  On an old show? 
[01:26:00]  Or this show?  Just now.  Just now.  A few minutes ago.  Wait, what did I say?  I don't know.  Sorry, what did he say?  Let's get to the bottom of this.  Slow down.  Go ahead.  Go.  You guys are talking about whether Michael Vick was coming back or not.  Yeah.  Opie was like, no, he's not coming back.  He's not coming back.  No one said three or four words.  I don't know what he said verbatim.  Dude, no one in the studio is agreeing with you.  Everyone's shaking their head no.  Hold on.  Than has something to say.  Than is going to teach you.  No, absolutely, man.  Absolutely.  Opie.  All right, let me go.  Opie said he is coming back, definitely in some form. 
[01:26:30]  The only person who said he's not going to play, I think, is Travis.  That might have been Travis, dude.  It might have been the voices or something.  I had to do that.  And don't confuse me for a girl ever again, John.  I'll do my best, Daryl.  Well, sir, I happen to make some very good points once in a while.  No, you know what?  I don't really give a crap what my athletes do.  I think he should be playing right now.  I think it would be awesome to watch Michael Vick knowing what he did in his time off.  I agree. 
[01:27:00]  He should throw some pit bulls on the field as well.  Yeah, I really don't care.  I don't care about the steroid thing.  I do care that Roger Clemens is, in my opinion, lying through his teeth saying he never did any steroids.  How the hell can he say that?  And Mike Lupica, God bless him, he's calling him out going, yeah, whatever.  Say whatever you want, but I want to see you say it in front of Congress.  No one's buying the fact that Roger Clemens didn't do anything.  No, no one is.  Sir, do you think he's coming back or no?  Sir? 
[01:27:30]  Oh, okay.  All right.  Yeah, I mean, Andy Pettit comes forward, said what he said, he's not getting any backlash from it.  He said, yeah, I used it to fix my elbow, I heard it made you heal faster, and that's it.  No one's talking about, oh, Andy Pettit, oh, Andy Pettit!  No one's talking about that.  But Clemens, he's still backpedaling, denying.  Well, I mean, he's...  I know what happened.  Andy and Roger were on the phone, and they both said, this is no good. 
[01:28:00]  And Roger said, yeah, man, I'm probably going to come out and just tell people I used it twice for my elbow.  And Andy Pettit said, that's cool, man.  And then immediately called the press.  And beat him to it.  Gave him that story.  Now Roger can't come out and go, me too.  Yeah, just throw him under the bus.  What he said.  You son of a...  I'm trying to see the exact quote from Clemens today.  Eh, I've got to find it again.  Oh, I want to state clearly and without qualification, I did not take steroids, human growth hormone, 
[01:28:30]  or any other banned substances at any time in my baseball career or, in fact, my entire life.  He has nothing to lose by denying, said the official who asked not to be identified,  because of the sensitivity of the issue.  But he's denying, because I don't think it's going to be easy to prove that he actually did it.  He probably knows that there's no real paper trail as far as what he was doing back in the day, in my opinion.  I don't know.  So there's most of these guys. 
[01:29:00]  No proof.  You know.  Well, no one signs for some package marked steroids for use immediately.  Right, right.  Right.  And by the way, yes, Dave and Jersey, the Jets would absolutely pick up Michael Vick as soon as he got out of jail.  The Jets would pick up Joel Steinberg if he could throw a football.  All right.  Except for a topical murder reference.  Throw a child if he can throw a football.  Tie the football to a radiator.  During the Pats game, we had to send in the third guy.  Don't even know his name.  Don't even want to know his name. 
[01:29:30]  I'm like, who's this guy?  Jets are in bad, bad shape, especially at the quarterback position.  Let's say hi to Lou on Long Island.  Lou.  Yeah, how's it going, guys?  How you doing this morning?  All right, Lou.  Lou.  What do you guys think about the whole Chris Simon thing?  He not only gets suspended for a slashing a ranger in the face last year, but now he steps on a penguin's ankle,  and he's kicked off the Islanders and everything.  I mean...  Well, I'm an Islander fan.  I love Chris Simon. 
[01:30:00]  He's an absolute animal.  He's not right in the head, and the Islanders pretty much suspended him.  I guess he stepped on the ankle, yeah, like you said, of a penguin's player the other night.  On purpose?  Didn't he push him down, too?  I didn't get to see that game.  Yeah, it was great.  I was there, actually.  They were just kind of standing right in front of the refs, and he kind of pushed him by pulling his skate out with his own foot.  And when the guy's on the ground, just right before he gets onto the bench, just steps right on his ankle with the skate.  That doesn't sound bad until you realize they're wearing skates. 
[01:30:30]  Yeah, that would hurt.  Well, and the guy's got a lot of padding down there, but still.  The Islanders basically said, Chris, you've got to get some help.  But they're going to welcome him back on the team eventually.  But if you want to have some fun, check out Chris Simon on YouTube.  He's had some fine incidents over the last few years.  A goon?  Oh, boy, is he a goon.  That's what hockey needs, though, more of those guys.  Goon it up.  Absolutely goon it up.  Thanks, Lou.  Absolutely, yep.  All right, let's say hi to Chris in Pennsylvania.  Chris, we're heading toward a break.  What do you got? 
[01:31:00]  Hey, if you read that Clemens quote again, he says he denies taking banned substances.  And in baseball, if he was taking them at the time, it wasn't banned.  So I think he's just trying to get around semantically.  Semantics, yeah.  But it seems like the way he did it, he named the substances.  And he also said, at any time in my career.  I know what you're saying, but he didn't seem to be covering bases.  He was making a very, very emphatic statement of denial.  Yeah, we've got to get Roland on the phone.  We've got to get Pete Rose on our show.  Because Pete Rose is loving this scandal right now. 
[01:31:30]  We've made fun of his haircut enough.  Yeah.  He's having a lot of fun with this.  I think we'd notice if Roland just booked a mongoloid to come in.  Hey, Pete, how you doing?  Hold on, Pete.  Slow down.  He sounds very excited.  We're going to stop spitting in a circle and licking the wall.  Why is Pete Rose staring at a pinwheel?  Easy, Pete.  That's a speaker you're trying to eat. 
[01:32:00]  You want to talk baseball.  Pete, simmer down.  Those headphones, you're covering your eyes with them, Pete.  We can't see you.  Pete, you were a baseball player, not a hockey player.  Get that helmet off.  Pete, why are you wearing a long summer dress and Converse ankle-high sneakers?  You look like a silly goose, and you're a man.  Pete, you should arrive in a limo, not a little yellow bus.  Pete, that's a newspaper, and you're eating it. 
[01:32:30]  That's right, Pete.  Two eating jokes in one stupid segment.  What do you think of them apples?  But he's saying that these guys are making a mockery of the game of baseball.  A mockery.  That is my favorite quote of the day right there from Pete Rose.  All right, we'll continue.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Stay there.  That's right.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Boy.  What else is going on today in America?  In this world.  On the planet.  Jimmy, you were talking about that coach. 
[01:33:00]  Yeah.  I had a coach like this when I was in high school.  He wanted to be just a cool coach.  That's all.  Well, this is not a high school.  This is Marietta, Georgia.  It's a coach.  He's facing charges.  He drove his middle school students.  Oh, middle school.  All right, I'm out.  Oopsie.  All right, I tap out.  I thought it was high school.  No, no, no.  It was a middle school student in a Christmas vandalism spree that left some plastic reindeer  in X-rated sexual positions.  This guy has been charged with criminal trespass for unlawful purposes 
[01:33:30]  and contributing to the delinquency of minors and reckless conduct.  But, I mean, he said he drove students around in the back of a pickup truck, and they vandalized  Christmas decorations.  That's awesome.  And they put the reindeer in, like, really sexual, dirty positions.  But how do you do that?  Think of that.  I guess you mount one on top of the other.  I guess, yeah, I guess that's the only one you can really go for.  Put the red nose in Santa's crotch.  Perhaps you turn one reindeer over, and maybe you have another reindeer on top of them,  facing, like, running in the other direction.  So it looks like they're both running over each other in the exact opposite.  I think there's a lot you can do with that, actually. 
[01:34:00]  The potential is endless.  It certainly is.  Put the reindeers end-to-end, standing up.  Looks like one is, you know, the back of the other one, and the back of the other one.  You know, and they're all getting to know each other.  I mean, that's just off the top of my head.  You could probably do a lot.  Maybe Mrs. Claus is there.  You make that dirty whore land.  You have a reindeer running over her little stupid open-mouthed face.  I saw the headline to that story, and I'm just thinking a high school coach, and I'm thinking,  that's fine.  Yeah.  A lot of us have had the cool, you know, coach in high school, but middle school, that's  a little rough.  This guy's driving 11-year-olds around trying to show them, you know, what he'd like them 
[01:34:30]  to do, and then he put them all in reindeer costumes.  What a creep.  How did he get caught?  There's always one kid that you bring along that has to freaking tell someone.  A little rat.  Always a little rat.  Probably brag to his friends.  Yeah.  You think it just comes down to bragging, and then it gets into the wrong hands?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Braggard.  I guess you're right.  I would tell people if my coach drove me around, and we did, like, all kinds of disgusting  things with reindeer.  But guess what we did?  Yeah.  You go to your little friends, and then the friend gets jealous that they weren't along, 
[01:35:00]  and then they have to rat out their buddy.  Or they just tell the parents, because you say, oh, Miss McMartin.  Oh, crotchety Miss McMartin.  Oh, boy.  Maybe a bad name.  Yeah, maybe a bad name.  I'm going to get another name.  Mrs. Smith.  No, no, no.  No, Mrs. Peterson.  Oh, damn.  You know, she has a little...  Yates.  Yeah, Mrs. Yates.  Take five of those reindeer, and you throw them in a little icy tub.  All right.  Right back.  Right back to the Andrea rates.  Andrea rates. 
[01:35:30]  Oh, well.  I'm tired.  Hey, a little cleanup happening here.  This is something we couldn't get to the other day.  Tow truck driver attempts to tow police car.  What was this guy thinking?  And it wasn't an unmarked, by the way.  No, he was angry.  Was he?  Yeah.  Just an angry guy.  I guess he was having some personal issues, and oops.  He decided this would be a good idea.  Police say Steven Syverson is the man who tried to tow that patrol car this morning while  they were responding to a domestic violence call.  Now, after a fairly tense situation, they did take him to jail, while several veteran 
[01:36:00]  cops just stood around in shock, wondering how it happened.  At the Kempton Downs complex tonight, you can clearly see no parking signs on the pavement.  But Officer Tom Pullman never thought they'd apply to him or his black and white, fully  marked Gresham police car, until his fellow officer alerted him on the radio.  It doesn't happen.  It's a police car.  But I'll be down there in a minute.  I finished what I was doing and went down, and there certainly was a tow truck backed  up to the back of my patrol car. 
[01:36:30]  How stupid can you be?  What a douche.  How dumb can you be?  What did the cop do?  Just walked in.  He dragged the guy out of the truck by his face?  How crazy, by the way, to see your car getting towed, and you have a gun.  Yeah.  And a taser.  And a badge.  Well, we'll see what happened.  He raped the tow truck driver.  Pullman says Steven Syverson already had the patrol car hooked up to his retriever towing  truck.  I asked him, basically, what are you doing? 
[01:37:00]  And he told me that I was parked in a fire lane.  After some discussion and Syverson mentioning a ticket that Gresham police gave him recently,  officials say he got in his truck, locked the doors, and would not come out.  That'll make him go away.  They warned him that he was under arrest, but they say Syverson would not budge.  He called someone on his cell phone and called someone on his radio and said he was surrounded  and he needed help.  I think he cracked.  I think there's just too much pressure, and he cracked, and that's the best we can figure 
[01:37:30]  out, because there's no warning of this at all.  Of course he cracked.  He gets into the cab of his truck and locks the doors, thinking that they'll go away,  and then starts radioing, hey, I'm surrounded.  I need help.  By what?  Police.  Well, that's who surrounded you.  Call the police.  Wait a minute.  Not the police.  Call the police from another town.  I'm surrounded by police officers from this town.  That's a real cry for help.  That's a guy.  That's a cry for help.  Like, you cannot attract the attention of the police more than by hooking up their car 
[01:38:00]  to a car truck and refusing to get out of the cab.  Yeah.  You can't get more attention than that.  Right, exactly.  Yeah, there's the fully marked cop car on the hook, and you're in the cab locked in there  with the cops.  You want to come out of there?  You can't attract more attention.  You can't without hurting somebody.  Yeah.  So this is a guy who's obviously ready to snap.  He's probably afraid he was going to do it.  This is all psychological babble, but then he knows he needs some attention, so he hooks  up the police car, and he sits there and calls for help.  Yeah.  He had gotten a ticket previously, that's what the story said, and he was kind of peeved 
[01:38:30]  about that.  So I guess he thought towing one of the cop cars would be a good idea.  Well, this is what happened to him.  Another one of those things that will go down is being one of the weirdest calls I've been  on in police work.  And Syverson has been fired from his job, and he is now facing several criminal charges,  including interfering with a police officer.  There you go.  You can't interfere with them.  So fired, fired, fired, fired, fired.  Of course he's going to get fired. 
[01:39:00]  You don't get a raise for that.  All right, well, you embarrassed the company, and you had the police come out for no reason  because you wouldn't get out of the cab because you had a cop car you were actually stealing.  All right, fine.  Hey, I just got to communicate from Than.  Going back to the crying thing.  Yes.  I cried at Howe Caverns.  Than cried at Haunted Mansion.  Haunted Mansion.  I cried on the Cyclone.  Cyclone.  I cried at everything.  Anthony cried from ages 2 to 17.  Just in tears.  Just pick one.  You're like Timothy Hutton in Ordinary People. 
[01:39:30]  It was just a cry.  And E-Rock beats everyone once again because he cried at a Shauna Na concert.  Yes.  Until now, because now we're finding out that Danny cried at a Metallica show two years ago.  Why?  Two years ago.  How old was he two years ago?  Why?  He was 25.  What scared him?  They said, you had too much, son.  Yeah.  Last call.  You really cried at a Metallica show.  It wasn't like bawling or anything, but I got a little misty.  Why?  Because they played, for their encore, they just played like a three-song set that they 
[01:40:00]  never, ever play live.  They never have played.  I'm absolutely crying.  Yeah, it was kind of like that, a little bit.  Yeah.  It wasn't crazy.  It's not like I was breathing all heavy and snotting, but-  What three songs?  Blown snot bubbles out your nose.  Were they obscure B-sized?  No, like Metal Militia, Dire's Eve.  They just don't, they usually don't play that stuff live.  You cried at Metal Militia.  You son of a-  I can't, Danny.  I could see almost if it was Unforgiven or if it was Nothing Else Matters, which is 
[01:40:30]  kind of an emotional song from Hetfield.  I can have some tears.  Yes, you can.  All of you can.  Yeah, but at the end of the night, I went two days in a row to that.  Hold on, I'm getting choked up here.  I was.  Seeing this live?  How drunk were you?  No, I don't drink at concerts.  Why?  I don't feel like dealing with-  That's the place you should be drinking.  With lines in the bathroom.  It's the only time he doesn't.  Missing my favorite songs because I have to urinate.  It's just not a good time.  That is so weird.  I don't even know what to say to that, crying at a Metallica show. 
[01:41:00]  It wasn't, like I said, it wasn't like a big, you know, a big production where I had  to like wipe my face off with my shirt or anything.  It was just, you know, I got a little watery.  I think a couple of tears might have rolled down the ocean.  All right, I'll share a little bit.  When I was working in Rochester, I went to Darien Lake to see Leonard Skinner.  The reformed Leonard Skinner.  And they've been back doing their thing for many years.  But, you know, they lost a lead singer along the way in a fine, fiery plane crash.  And then they decided to get back together.  I don't know how many years. 
[01:41:30]  Maybe we can look it up.  And, you know, they use the younger Vant brother there, Van Zandt brother.  And they sound just like freaking Leonard Skinner.  Unbelievable.  They're in rare form.  Like, they never went away because he sounds a lot like his brother, right?  And then it came time for Freebird.  And the guy comes out.  And you just knew there was something about to happen.  And basically, he takes a hat that his brother used to wear, puts it on the mic stand.  And then next thing you know, there's one spotlight on the mic stand. 
[01:42:00]  And the band plays that just without vocals.  Was the rim burnt off?  You should have tipped the mic stand on its side.  And there wasn't a dry eye in the house as they played the instrumental version of Stairway to Heaven.  Freebird.  And the whole crowd at Darien Lake was singing along to this.  Was it 11 minutes without anybody singing?  Oh, yeah.  The song just ended five minutes ago.  It was an amazing.  It was one of those amazing concert moments, though. 
[01:42:30]  They nailed it.  And I think to this day, that's how they handle Freebird in concert, if I'm not mistaken.  Unless in recent years, they've decided, all right, enough of this.  Yeah, the hat.  It's not even his.  We bought it somewhere.  Right, right.  Enough of this crap trying to get tears from our audience.  Let's just play the damn song.  They want to hear it.  Sweetie.  Teary at a concert.  Oh, no.  Gwen Stefani?  No, but mine's completely justified, because I was not alone.  I think every single person in there was a little teary. 
[01:43:00]  Can we guess what year?  What year?  Can you tell us what year?  It was 2001.  All right.  Wait a minute.  2001.  Mm-hmm.  Uh, what's the first letter of the band?  You.  The Uptown Boys.  Yeah, that was a tough one, man.  Yeah.  Thank you for that.  U2, uh, was, uh, doing a tribute to everybody that died, uh, in 9-11.  They showed everybody.  The 9-11 attack. 
[01:43:30]  So they had all the names scrolling behind them on these giant screens.  And I think, what song were they doing?  I believe it was one.  One.  Oh, man.  That was tough.  Standing there, trying to man up.  And you're just like, oh, Jesus, I'm not going to be able to take this.  All he did.  And then you turn your eyes to the side, and you just see, like, grown men.  Like, oh, this isn't going to happen.  Oh, jeez.  F you, too, for doing that to us.  I know.  I felt like that.  Like, screw these guys.  And I love you, too. 
[01:44:00]  But it's like, look, we don't need for you to pull more emotion out of us.  We're all feeling what happened.  We were pretty beat up at the time.  It's here in New York City.  It's not like they were doing a concert in L.A. or something.  It was a nice tribute.  Don't get me wrong.  But, you know, stop.  I don't even count that.  It didn't need to get everyone crying like that.  The sheer number of names that were going up behind them.  They had three giant columns that went from the stage to the rafters.  Well, it started out slow.  It was like some kind of thing that kind of came up from the floor. 
[01:44:30]  Yeah.  And then it started slow.  And by the time it hit the rafters, the names just kept going and going and going.  And you're like, oh, my God, these names are going to go the whole goddamn song.  And they just kept going and going and going.  And you're like, oh, this just sucks.  You bastard.  You got me.  I don't count that, though.  That's like a real.  Oh, this is awful.  Excuse me.  It is crying at a concert.  But that's not like what this blubbering disaster is.  Metallica.  Metallica because they played a few B-sides. 
[01:45:00]  What the F is wrong with you?  They never play that stuff.  Yeah, but do they, like, dedicate it to...  No, it just gave me that feeling that, like, that's what bands start to do when they're  not going to be around for much longer.  That was the feeling that I had gotten.  And I'm like, wow, this whole thing is going to be over soon.  Well, aside from completely displaced emotions, Danny, you've probably been to, like, relatives'  funerals and didn't cry.  I don't think I've ever cried at a funeral.  I will say I've certainly wept like that, like that type of thing at Sabbath concerts 
[01:45:30]  and just loving...  Of course I have.  I think every guy has done that.  If you like the band enough, I don't think that's that bad.  Why would you...  You wept at a Sabbath show?  Who wouldn't?  For what reason?  Because they were back together.  They were back together.  Of course.  I was so happy.  It was joy.  It was just beauty and joy.  All right.  Yeah.  But, I mean, to me, the U2 thing is very...  That's legit.  Oh, yeah.  If you're not crying...  You have to be a...  There's something wrong with you not to cry at that.  Here we go.  Do we...  Now, this sounds really fruity.  Believe me.  You're at a Broadway show. 
[01:46:00]  That's pretty fruity.  And you cry because another one of the actors is dead?  Yeah.  It's not crying.  It's like you get that lump in your throat and kind of...  You feel it, like, backing up behind your eyeballs.  During, like, the final note of one of those giant vocal numbers where there's harmonies going on and the whole cast is, like, singing.  And it's just ringing. 
[01:46:30]  Like, just ringing harmonies from a lot of people.  And it has that dynamic where it might start slow and really build.  And then, boom!  It stops like that.  That gives me goosebumps and, like, brings out this, like, emotion.  What did it...  What song?  I think it was something from Disney's Beauty and the Beast.  No, I'm kidding, of course.  Wow.  I'm teasing, of course.  I'm trying to remember what show it was. 
[01:47:00]  Oh, I think, like, Les Mis.  Les Mis.  I don't know.  It's just so huge.  Like, this big...  And it's the whole sound of alive.  And you realize it's coming out of human beings.  You know, their friggin' mouths are making this, you know, great harmony.  That you cried at a Screwdriver concert?  Yes, Screwdriver and Panzer...  Any band handled by Panzerfaust.  I usually shed a little tear.  Let's go to South Carolina.  Music is known, by the way.  Music yanks out emotion. 
[01:47:30]  That's why death row inmates, when they're walking to their death, they don't play music,  because it puts you in a weird place.  So they won't let them listen to you.  It's not going to remember it that long, anyway.  They strap on the gurney.  They should play Coldplay's greatest hits for those guys as they walk into their death.  Queen, another one bites the dust.  Somebody that they absolutely hate, so they'll be grateful for the needle.  Please, pump the poison in already.  Holy crap.  Now I'm hearing that you two used the same gag.  Randy, New Orleans, what's up?  No way.  Come on, Randy.  After Hurricane Katrina, the Saints played the first season, mostly away games and over 
[01:48:00]  at LSU, and then the first home game back in the Superdome was a Monday night game against  Atlanta, and U2 was an opening performance for it, and they came out, and the place was  silent.  They showed nothing but videos of the storm and what happened after the storm, and then  U2 came out and did the States are coming song up to a big crescendo, and everybody in  the place was boo-hooing.  Oh, I think you said they did names.  I think all the dogs at Michael Vick drowned.  Look, I don't go to concerts for the death montage. 
[01:48:30]  I don't go to concerts to see a montage of how the entire world sucks and we need to  help the world.  I just want to hear a couple of greatest hits.  Get a t-shirt and get the F out of there.  Enough of the dumb montages of starving African kids and Hurricane Katrina victims all tied  into one neat package.  I'll say, I don't like U2's music that much.  I know I'm in the minority, but I do like Bono.  The guy's a real humanitarian.  Oh yeah, you can, you know, knock him for what he's doing, but I'm just not a fan of 
[01:49:00]  those montages.  I'm like, all right, I get it.  The world sucks, and we're greedy Americans, and we need to help everybody.  I get it.  Hey Dan, are you a big Metallica fan?  Yeah, big time.  Are you jealous that when they did SNL, Jim Brewer brought me, so I got to watch them  warm up and play Memory Remains?  You mean SNM?  I don't recall.  I had the SNL album.  Oh, SNL, Saturday Night Live.  Oh, I'm a douche.  Oh.  Damn it.  Damn it.  Oh my God.  Wow.  Somebody was a little chomping at the chair.  Yeah, I got a face. 
[01:49:30]  Hold on.  Yes, I am.  Wow.  Don't abbreviate for him.  Do you remember when they did that program on NBC called Saturday Night Live at 11.30?  It airs live, you know, sometimes with a five-second delay, so technically not live.  And they did Fuel, the song, not the actual liquid, and the Memory Remains.  And I get to stand probably the length of the studio and watch them rehearse and do the  songs over and over, and I guess about 25 feet away, I get to stand there and watch the  boys.  That is definitely something I would be extremely jealous of. 
[01:50:00]  Yeah.  They'd have to take after take, because they'd just hear, oh, oh, oh, in the background.  I went to an autograph signing once at some place in Times Square, and I had to wake up  two days in a row to get there at like 5 a.m. to wait on line just to meet them.  And in my head, as I'm on line, it was an hours-long line, I'm like, all right, what  am I going to say to James?  What am I going to say to Kirk?  I'm working it all out in my head.  And finally, when I go down the autograph line, I just froze up.  I had nothing to say.  The line had even backed up, and Lars was trying to initiate a conversation.  He's like, hey, so what's up, man?  And I'm just like, nothing. 
[01:50:30]  Oh, no.  You blew it.  You blew it.  You're shot.  It's the only time I ever met them.  They inducted Sabbath into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, so of course I was there.  And when Metallica came out to the press conference, after they played for Sabbath, I questioned  them.  I mean, I wasn't supposed to, because I wasn't technically a reporter.  Thanks to Black Earl, I got it.  And the real reporters are behind me, and I'm like, ah, hey, why didn't you pick the...  There are no real reporters, Jimmy.  You're right.  I was as legitimate as any of them.  You were just as qualified as they were.  Let's say hi to Matt in South Carolina. 
[01:51:00]  Or no, we're going to go with...  Okay, Joe in Jersey.  What's up, Joe?  What's going on, dude?  I was at a Coldplay concert a couple of months ago, or I don't know, a year ago.  Who knows?  And it was in Camden, the Twitter center.  We're all on the lawn, all high and shit, or whatever.  Oh, I curse.  I'm sorry.  Hello?  Yeah, go ahead.  Hello?  Hello?  And they played that song, Fix You, and I used to hate Coldplay, and I got dragged to  the concert for my girlfriend, and she's a stupid...  She's a big hippie.  So we're there, you know, doing the thing on the lawn, and they start playing this song, 
[01:51:30]  Fix You.  Never heard it before.  And I just start crying, dude, because everybody around me is crying.  I get to have some meaning to everybody around there, but it had no meaning to me.  Why would you cry during that song?  What got you?  I don't...  Just like...  I mean, they get to one point, like, the vocals come in, and he's doing a great job.  Yeah.  And then the guitarist, the guy at the guitarist, starts to strum, and people are just starting  to scream, you know, like Anthony said, the chills are going up your spine, right down  your butthole.  It's crazy.  Yeah, I...  And I start crying. 
[01:52:00]  I don't mind Coldplay, actually.  But they're starting to sound...  Every song is starting to sound the same there.  They gotta...  They gotta come up with a new sound, I'm thinking.  Coldplay?  By the way...  Oh, sorry.  It's like the whole strumming of the guitar thing, and it's just...  That's it.  I lost it.  Yeah, they're a very emotional band.  They do some things with their guitars, that band Coldplay.  All right, Joe.  Thank you, sir.  Can I apologize to Ron Bennington real quick?  Yeah.  Thank you, Iraq, for putting me...  Someone tell Ron that I'm apologizing for the last two years.  I've been giving stupid Earl credit for getting me in to see Sabbath. 
[01:52:30]  Earl did take the picture.  The pass he got me, though, was Ron Bennington's pass.  All right.  And I believe Ron gave up that pass so I could go.  I'm assuming he did that.  He may not have.  Of course he did.  He's a martyr.  Of course he did.  And my apologies.  He's great, man.  He's like Jesus.  He certainly is.  Let's go to Chris in Boston.  Jim, you're in front of Sabbath.  Hello.  Yeah.  Chris, what's up?  Thanks, Ronnie.  Hey, man.  I was at a cool show, and I was tripping on like six hits of acid.  And they played, I think it was Schism. 
[01:53:00]  Oh, man.  It just brought me to a weird place.  It brought you to a weird place?  That was the drug stalker, though, man.  Because I was tripped out on acid.  Good stuff.  I was seeing everything melt, and it was good times.  Tool is amazing to watch live.  I missed him the last time around, and I'm bummed.  Yeah, I think I took those tickets off your hands.  Did you really?  Yeah.  It was a school night or something, probably?  I just don't remember.  It was first row tickets at a tiny little venue.  Some opera house or something.  It was really amazing.  I love watching Tool.  They're amazing. 
[01:53:30]  Can I say what a nerd I am?  I went to a concert in 84.  I think one of my first times seeing Ozzy was Ozzy and Motley Crue on the Shout of the Devil tour.  And after the concert, I was with my friends Elias and Tony Harmasilla, the two guys like rock freaks from North Brunswick.  And I was upstairs, and I thought I saw Motley Crue walking around.  So I made them.  I'm like, come on, guys.  I see Motley Crue.  We ran over.  It was just four guys with blonde hair, and they're like, you're so lame.  Just walking around like in the rotunda?  Yeah.  I thought I saw Motley Crue.  All right.  Two more. 
[01:54:00]  We got to take a break.  No.  Carl in Westchester.  What's up?  Hey, boys, I got one that it's impossible not to cry at.  Went and saw Billy Joel when he was doing those, like, 11 nights at the Garden.  11 nights at the Garden, yep.  Tonight, Saigon had, like, veterans from the Lord up until now up there singing the We Would All Go Down Together.  Wow.  Your phone kind of broke up, but I'm sort of with you.  He brought the veterans out on the stage?  Yeah.  That part was, you know, we would all go down together. 
[01:54:30]  Yeah.  It was just four or two up until the current Gulf War, like, holding hands and singing it, and it was just ridiculous.  Why wasn't Billy Joel in the nom?  Just old soldiers on stage singing that part of the song, huh?  Yeah.  It was the kind of thing where you couldn't help it if you didn't cry.  Right on, man.  Thanks, Carl.  All right, and finally, Matt in South Carolina.  Matt, what's up?  Hey, fellas.  This isn't quite as manly as crying at a concert, but the old Charlie Brown special, Snoopy Come Home, all lies. 
[01:55:00]  Oh, man, that's pretty bad.  I'm loving this bit.  We've got to continue after the break.  That's pretty bad.  You can hear it.  It's a man's man on the phone.  All right, well, the Snoopy special, Snoopy Come Home, it got me.  Charlie Brown was very upset.  Snoopy had run off, and he really wanted him home.  You had it.  But, Matt, how old were you?  How old?  Five or eight.  Oh, and Charlie Brown was going, Snoopy. 
[01:55:30]  Snoopy.  Oh, I felt so bad.  You got to think by the end of the episode, though, Snoopy has to come home or the peanuts are done.  No, he's dead.  They found him on the side of the road with maggots crawling in and out of his eyes, and  the bottom part of him that was laying on the street was completely flat.  They found him in Michael's place, buried.  His little Snoopy snout cape shut so they could drown him.  All right, Matt.  Thank you.  Hey, happy birthday, little Jimmy.  Thank you.  Oh, wow, yeah, we almost forgot.  Very good.  Godspeed.  Hey, with that, for your birthday, why don't you give away tickets to your New Year's Eve show, 
[01:56:00]  Jimmy?  I gave them away earlier.  Oh, that was the only pair you got?  I'm going to give them tomorrow.  I'll give them on a skate.  No, no, no, I'm going to do a whole thing tomorrow.  Bogota's almost sold out last show.  Skinflint.  No, no, no.  My lips, your lips to God's ears.  I screwed that one up.  Thank you.  Get a few more tickets for the fans.  All right, we'll do this.  If you call in right now, something's going on, we'll give away, it's a special thing  I'm doing, where you'll get a pair of tickets, you'll also get a VIP pass, which means you 
[01:56:30]  come back, I possibly say hello to you, and you get VIP parking.  The first two callers get that.  Third caller, you get nothing but a slap to your face.

[01:59:30]  But then if you're like a human being  You leave the theater  And you think about it  Like, are they going to really welcome  John Canning into their home  Or is this a one-shot deal?  Because he's annoying  Right  He'll annoy them  Right  So they give him a nice warm meal  In a warm house  During a snowy night  And that's it  Get your fat ass out the door  Beat it, stupid  That's your lonely life  And you realize  Like, oh yeah  He hasn't been talking to her  I was like, wow  Yeah, when you realize she's dead  You're like, oh man  You're kidding  That sucks  Let's go to John in Jersey

[02:00:30]  I have no idea of watching  Stupid Mike Piazza cry like that  I don't like how you made it  I don't like how you made 9-11  Levin about yourself  Yeah  You were a little mad that you couldn't see  A little baseball for a couple weeks  I'm sorry  Also, two movies I cried at  Miracle and Rudy  Rudy  The Giuliani story?  When he finally realized he has a cleft lip  And kids that hate him  All right, boys, take care

Hi  That movie Castaway, remember?  Yes  No  By the way, if you cried when Wilson floated away  I'll bite your fingers off  I actually didn't  But my son, who's 11  Had his first cry during a movie  Whenever that came out 
[02:01:30]  I don't remember  Aw, poor queer  But when he lost  He bawled his eyes out  He bawled his eyes out  It was  Aw  I felt like a horrible mother  Well, no, you know  Does Little Mary play soccer?

A man reportedly beat  Seven-year-old boy  For wearing pink nail polish  Oh  Is that your boy?  Is that your boy?  Like the pink nail polish? 
[02:02:00]  It could be  I don't know  I think he's at school  But I'm not  Come on, Kim  There's nothing to be ashamed of  I mean, it was a sad movie  The little Nancy  Got all choked up  It happens  The little Nancy  But that was all he had, Jimmy  It's all he had  How old is the pansy now?  He's 11 now  Well, I'm sure  A little girly boy  Is doing fine  Yeah  Well, he's hanging out  With that guy  Who cried watching Rudy  Yeah  Alright, thank you  Throw your own kid  Under the bus  What a wonderful woman  Let's go to Stryker  From Wackback 
[02:02:30]  Stryker  Good morning, boys  Hey  Hey  And Jimmy  Jimmy will appreciate this  I cried at a Springsteen concert  Because of a girl  I would cry at a Springsteen concert  Why?  Because of a girl  In 85  When he was on his  Born in the USA tour  He played two nights  Here in Denver  One night  I won tickets  To fourth row  Center stage  Wow  The second night  A friend of mine  Gave me two tickets  Twentyth row  Center stage  There was this girl 
[02:03:00]  At high school  That I was friends with  I had always wanted  To date her  She kept saying no  But she was a massive  Springsteen fan  When she found out  I had these tickets  She begged me to take her  So I  The second night  Halfway through the concert  I realized  That the only reason  She was there with me  Was because of a Springsteen  Ah, now you're stuck  At a Springsteen show  And it come the next morning  She would think  I was a total  Incomplete ass again  Well what 
[02:03:30]  What made  How did you not know that  From the beginning  You know what though  You gotta take a shot  At that whole thing  You gotta think  That maybe I could  Turn this whole thing  Around with a Springsteen  Turn this around  Right  I was  I was  17 at the time  What was I supposed to do  Whatever happened  To this pig  Ah  Well  That's just that  She became a pig  She went from  A cheerleader  To a fat mess  Good  That's what she gets  For not servicing you  Properly in the parking lot  After the show  Absolutely  I didn't even get 
[02:04:00]  A peck on the cheek  After either show  From her  No  Why didn't you do it  What didn't you notice  After the first one  You should have put  The kibosh on the second one  And taken someone else  Well  You know  Ugh  Really  Dreamer  It was one of those things  I was 17 at the time  I was horny  I thought I'd get more  And I got nothing  Well you're not alone  I'm sure there's a lot of people  That have done exactly  What you're talking about  Well what you should have done  Is like  You should have like  Like every time you sang a song  Throwing your arms up  In like the victorious V  And then like  Let your forearms 
[02:04:30]  Smash your face by accident  Just to protest  Yeah  Bring in Steve and Roland  We gotta find out  What made them cry  Thank you Stryker  Let's go to Mike  Let's go to Mike  On Long Island  Mike what's up  Mike  Hey  I cried when  When in Jackass  They were servicing  No force  Okay terrific  Let's say hi to  Brian in Jersey  Brian what's up  Hey what's going on guys  Hey  I cried when  They changed the size 
[02:05:00]  Of my Jimmy Dean  Sausage packing  Linger longer  Sausage  Hey Roland what makes you cry  For when  Like we're talking about  When we cried  Like movies  Or songs  Broadway shows  Yeah  It's  Probably get teary eyed  When Bruce Springsteen  Plays a rare song  What's up with the rare song  The rare song  What song makes you cry  From Springsteen  One in the USA right  I'd cry too  I'd be like  Play the hits  You dummy  I spent a ton of money  On your tickets  Like Incident on 57th Street 
[02:05:30]  Frankie  Cynthia  Shouldn't you cry  Because you realize  How much money  You spent on the  Bruce Springsteen ticket  And then you realize  Halfway through the show  That we were right  And he's one of the most  Overrated musicians  Of all time  No I'm happy to spend  Any amount on Bruce  And I smile  He is worth it though  You drank the juice  The Bruce juice  It's in me  We're going to give you  A double shot of Bruce juice  I hope so  On the home of rock and roll  Alright  Dude you drank the Kool-Aid man  He's worth the money 
[02:06:00]  You're in the Bruce cult  It's not that great  Yeah but all three nights already  I got my ticket set  So when this plays  You'll like  Start cheering up  Yeah hear it  This is what makes you cry  What is this song about either  It's the same thing  It's a rare song  He played off his box set  Sounds like every other Bruce song  You know why it's a rare song right  Because he even realized  How much it sucked  It's a bunch of crap  No it's good  If he had pride in the song  He would have played it a long time ago 
[02:06:30]  And he would play it a lot  You think he lets  Born in the USA  Just sit there  Doesn't play it  He doesn't play it all the time though  What is he crazy  Why  That's what people want to see  He plays like once  Every other tour  Oh stop  And then you can talk  With all the other Bruce fans  Like I was at the show  That played Born to Run  The good part is  He opens up his rehearsals  So you pay $100 a ticket  To see him rehearse  Really  Oh that's cool  What  What a nice guy  That's a blue collar guy  If I ever heard of one  With the rehearsals  And the concert  Well it's like  He'll rehearse in Jersey 
[02:07:00]  And he'll open it up  For $100 a ticket  And you see them rehearse  How about opening it up  For like  Underprivileged  People that can't really  Afford to see Bruce  Or people that  Couldn't get their tickets  Because it sold out so fast  Yeah  What a pompous ass  Where does that money go  To the Bruce Foundation  For Bruce  I don't mind that  I like that actually  No  No that's awful  I think it's awful  Awful  $100 a seat to see him  Start and stop songs  Over and over  You need to buy new blue jeans 
[02:07:30]  And then he throws your bone  And he plays a couple songs  In their entirety  Because he knows  He got your money  Yeah I travel to Jersey  Yeah that's great  That's awesome  That's a sound check  You pay $100 to your  Boof  Boof  Boof  No  It's a full song  Alright the kick  Boof  Boof  Boof  Boof  Boof  That's our lucky part  If we can see that  You get to see that  Alright run across  The whole thing  Boof  Boof  Boof  Boof  Boof  Boof  Boof  Boof  Boof  Boof  Boof  Boof  Boof  Boof  Boof  Boof  Boof  Boof  Boof  But then they play 
[02:08:00]  A whole like  Two and a half hours  Like rehearsals  And then they do the show  The night  That night  They'll do like  Five rehearsal shows  Throughout the  Two weeks  And then a week later  They do the full show  So you see like  Different sets  Mix it up  I don't mind  If Sabbath did that  With different songs  And stuff  I would absolutely  Go see that  You'd see Sabbath  Taking dumps  I have  It's like  Only like  In a 1500 seat arena  That's taking advantage  Man  No  They get enough money  Yeah  First of all  These concerts  Are overpriced 
[02:08:30]  To begin with  It's ridiculous  What has become  Of Cena  Your band  Let's go to  Alex in Philly  Alex  Alex  Obviously call me  What do you have  A problem with there  Alex  That movie I cried  At at the end  Was Field of Dreams  When he has  A cat that is dead  Yep  Me too  Well  Maybe that'll get you  That's a biggie  Yeah  That's a great scene  Yeah  Alright boys 
[02:09:00]  Check it out  Alright  Thank you  I don't know  So he might have  Had more  Don't elaborate on it  We all expected  Something out of  The other party  And none of us  Delivered  No one delivered  None of us did  He didn't  Steve  What makes you cry  When you realize  The bible frowned  Upon certain activities  I'm done  I'm done  Was it five seconds  Before I was queer  It's a new record  Yeah exactly  The longest time ever  The longest time 
[02:09:30]  The longest time  That you tricked us  Yeah  I think  I can remember  At least one Broadway show  I saw Wicked  And I welled up  During one of the songs  And  Yeah  But towards the end  I think  Yeah this is the manly part  Yeah  The manly  This is the part  The construction workers like  And then 
[02:10:00]  I think  Rascal Flats  Has a couple songs  That  We're still on Wicked  This stuff makes you cry  No only when I saw it  Only you know  For the same reason  Anthony mentioned  Because you know  You're in the moment  You're in the moment  You have this huge  Theatrical experience  You know  Everyone around you  Is watching  This  You know  This very  Moving performance  There's you know  Lights  And everybody around you  Is welling up too 
[02:10:30]  That  Doesn't help  You know what  It gets me  About Broadway shows  Is that stupid  Dynamic thing they do  Where there's a stage  Full of people  For the big finale thing  And it goes from  Very quiet  To this huge build  Yeah  And at the end  It's  They're all  Fuck  Oh excuse me  They're all  What is it  It's curse day today  They're all just  You know  Harmonizing  And it sounds great  And it kind of just  It's a little  Tuning fork in your head 
[02:11:00]  I think that's it  Or you're just  You know  Or you're  Blamingly homosexual  And things like this  There's just  This medley of voices  That one did it  In context maybe  Of the show  Yeah  In the context of a show  Where you're watching  Here that's the big  There you go  That big  See you get those  Big endings  Like that  Damn  The whole place  Goes up  And then  Bravo 
[02:11:30]  Then you rush  To the garage  To get your car  Before everyone else  And then some skinny guy  Comes out and asks for money  To help his friends  Instead of curtain  Just a giant robe  And tribute  Had to get that one  And didn't we  Of course  Alright we're out of here  That's the end of the  Open Anthony program today  Bam  We'll see you tomorrow  Bam  That  Opie and Anthony 
[02:12:00]  You </pre>
