<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with Patrice O'Neal filling in for Jim Norton.  The hosts discussed their monotonous daily routines, the realism (or lack thereof) in modern video games compared to older titles, and the merits of online versus single-player gaming.  O'Neal detailed his Tiger Woods PGA Tour experiences, leading to a conversation about the portrayal of male and female leads in movies (using *Alien* and *Kill Bill* as examples) and broader societal expectations of women.  They then shifted to the stock market, Jim Cramer's advice, and its impact on different economic classes.  The declining state of their radio station, budget cuts, staff reductions (including the loss of the "K-Rock girls" and a large promotions department), and faulty microphones were heavily lamented.  The hosts speculated on the future of radio.

Next, they discussed O.J. Simpson's guilty verdict and played a parody song, "O.J. Folsom Prison Blues," by RPI. This transitioned into "Jocktober," a segment mocking the WDOK Cleveland morning show, specifically targeting Terry Moir and Trapper Jack, utilizing photos from the station's website to enhance their mockery.  Their criticism focused on the show's perceived blandness, lack of edginess, and the hosts' perceived inadequacies.

The show continued with a vehement condemnation of Broadway shows and live theatrical performances (with exceptions for *Young Frankenstein* and *The Wedding Singer*), live music (with exceptions for Run DMC, LL Cool J, Public Enemy, and Jay-Z), and other forms of live entertainment like Cirque du Soleil (praised) and Blue Man Group (disliked). O'Neal shared his own negative Broadway experiences and discussed Chris Rock's latest stand-up special, contrasting it with his earlier work.  Isolated audio segments from Terry Moore and Terry Clifford were played, highlighting their perceived inanity.  Dane Cook's comedic style was also discussed.  Anthony shared childhood anecdotes involving frequent crying and a traumatic experience with a family friend.

The following segment focused on Chris Rock's new special, with caller opinions, and how celebrities are lampooned on shows like *Family Guy* and *Mad Magazine*, using Minnie Driver and Dane Cook as examples.  A significant portion was dedicated to mocking David Tyree's book, "More Than Just the Catch," reading excerpts and highlighting its religious themes and self-congratulatory tone.  A Primetime Gossip (PTG) segment announced the departure of producer Danny.  An in-studio interview with David Tyree followed, characterized by the hosts' continued mockery of his book and Tyree's responses, creating numerous awkward moments.

The final segment involved a heavily improvised, mocking "interview" with Tyree, further ridicule of his book, and significant improvisational comedy and banter amongst the hosts, including impersonations and offensive language. Other topics included a malfunctioning studio TV/cable system, a Fisher-Price baby doll that allegedly spouted religious phrases, a review of a previous guest's one-man Star Wars show, and the "Line of the Day" segment with listener-submitted jokes (some racist in nature).  Throughout the show, Patrice O'Neal remained a guest in the studio, with promotional mentions for his upcoming shows at the conclusion.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Time to do it again.  Yes.  Good morning.  It's a never-ending cavalcade of entertainment that comes out of our mouths on a daily basis.  See, here's the problem with doing radio.  We had a really good show yesterday, Patrice.  Patrice is here.  This is why we say this today.  We now have to do it again today. 
[00:00:30]  Do it again.  And we'll have another good show today.  I have no doubt in my mind.  Do it again.  And then tomorrow we do it again.  And then again.  And then again.  And then again.  And Patrice, guess what?  You get to do the show today, and then you just walk away.  And while you're doing your life, we'll be here doing it again.  And again.  And again.  And again.  And then you come back and see us.  Say hi.  And then we show you that fake enthusiasm and energy and happiness. 
[00:01:00]  And I quit.  It's just a weird, weird gig.  Yeah, very strange.  But here we are.  Well, we love doing it, Patrice.  Phone number 877-212-O&A.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Hi.  Now we ask what everyone did since the last time we got together.  Nothing.  It's like, you know, 24 hours. 
[00:01:30]  What do you want from me?  It's like one day went by.  Yeah.  Tried to sleep.  You tried to sleep.  Couldn't do it.  Played a little PSP.  Yeah.  Tried to sleep again.  What's your game of choice?  Right now, I have to say, I'm playing Tiger Woods Golf.  Ah.  Holla!  Yeah.  You got to get it for the PlayStation 3, though, my friend.  You don't really have to holla, by the way.  Oh, sorry.  You just said that.  PlayStation, Tiger Woods, the first one.  Not even in 2009. 
[00:02:00]  Oh.  The first one.  I'm learning how to, I'm learning different things like bogey.  Double bogey.  You're learning golf.  Eagle.  I know this.  I know this by playing the game.  Yeah.  A par three, it's impossible to get an eagle unless you get a hole in one.  Yeah, which is possible.  You can't get an eagle unless you get a hole in one on a par three.  That's possible.  Very difficult to get an eagle on a par four because you have to get a hole in two. 
[00:02:30]  You got to get very good placement.  Oh, you have so much to learn.  You got to get your skills up, my friend.  Par five, possible to get an eagle on a par five.  Very possible to get an eagle.  I don't know what's before an eagle on a par five.  I've never seen it.  I think they used to call it an albatross.  No, double eagle.  What's an albatross then?  We used to use albatross growing up. 
[00:03:00]  I know it's impossible to get a hole in one on a par five.  It's probably never been done.  I don't watch golf at all.  I'm just from playing this game.  I didn't know the game had an option to play the caddy.  Oh, see, because you're in a sport four.  Wow.  Wow, you guys, that is some early racism.  I'm not even awake.  Do you see how early they, man, you just got to get up with the white people, man.  Oh, man. 
[00:03:30]  Hey, black folks, do you see they're never ending?  They're proactive, man.  Wow.  I was just having a normal golf discussion with my friend Patrice.  Yeah, I was actually happy learning about golf.  Bagger O'Neal is coming in.  The legend of Bagger O'Neal.  And this is, Jesus Christ, I was actually a kind of gentleman, Negro, at about 6, 6.02.  I was just happy that you knew something about the white world that I was just kind of relating  with.  Yeah, I had to ruin it with some racism.  No kidding.  Well, it's the black world now, let's be quite honest. 
[00:04:00]  Dude, I'm all about Tiger Woods.  I bring it up on the show.  No one cares.  There's a few people out there.  I'm playing, like, easily four to six hours a day on PlayStation 3.  It's very, very fun.  You have to get PlayStation 3, get the latest game, get really good, and then go online.  I had a match with a guy last night.  I was 18 under.  Whoa, Jesus.  I averaged a birdie a hole.  That's a birdie a hole.  I had a couple eagles in there as well. 
[00:04:30]  It's not that impressive on the game.  In real life it would be.  In real life it's amazing.  Oh, God.  In real life it would be a throw.  But you think you're good, then you go online.  And I was shooting the lights out of the ball.  I'm 18 under after 18 holes.  I lost.  The guy was 20 under.  But that's only, I'm not impressed.  20 under.  Because he can, he, you figure out the courses.  Yeah.  You keep figuring out how hard to hit.  The problem is there's little teeny things about the game that makes it actually challenging. 
[00:05:00]  Is that you have to, it's as power hits and there's, you got to learn, okay, if it goes  into the rough and you pick one of those sticks, I still call them sticks.  The sticks.  If you pick a stick and you hit it, like say if the pen.  Well, if you're in the rough, you're going to need a little more power.  Right.  So, so if you have, if you're, if you're in the fairway, but if you're in the rough, you're 
[00:05:30]  going to have to club up, they call it.  There you go.  Or club down, actually.  Club up.  Club down, right.  Very interesting stuff.  Yeah.  So.  You know, and I buy a lot of attributes, went for a lot of power.  Yeah.  It's a fun game.  You know what it is though?  It's a fun game.  Not to watch though, but to play on PSP.  Yeah.  That game cannot translate.  It's a great game.  Believe me.  But as far as real golf is concerned, it just cannot translate.  It does though.  The actual difficulty of swinging that club and hitting that ball in real life. 
[00:06:00]  But the brand new Tiger Woods, everything you would do on a golf course or attempt to  do on a golf course, it is that accurate with the game.  It's incredible.  But you're right.  I mean, in real life, you still got to swing the damn club.  You know something?  Because on the game, I'm not topping the ball.  I'm not topping the ball in the game.  I'm driving every time.  I might, you know, go left or right or something like that.  Right.  But on a real course, I'll sit there, the ball frigging go three feet in front of my  tee, and I'll be like, son of a bitch. 
[00:06:30]  You used to love the golf games.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  I still occasionally.  But now that you're single, you know.  Tiger Woods.  Yeah.  You know, this stuff goes by the wayside.  You know, computer games.  Stupid computer games.  Who needs that when you have youth behind?  When you have real girls knocking at your door at all hours.  Why would you play?  I just like wood.  Why would you play video games?  I'd play wood.  Just wood.  All right.  You know what?  I'm not officially ready, but I'm XMOP online. 
[00:07:00]  I'm not ready, but there you go.  What?  People have been asking for my PlayStation 3.  Oh.  Well, you really tried to hide your name, did you?  Yeah.  I'm XMOP, Greg Hughes.  Dot, dot.  Here's my address as part of my name.  That's smart, though, because nobody would ever think it would be me.  And that's really him.  Sometimes you got to.  Is this really OP?  It's me OP.  Sometimes you got to go with the obvious, but.  I get that on, when I play online, poker, or obviously Call of Duty 4. 
[00:07:30]  I get, you know, hey, it's Anthony.  You know, people know who you are when you're on those game sites.  But then you spend half the time, like, proving to these.  I'm not chatting, first of all.  I don't chat when I play games.  Maybe they chat to frigging.  Then they don't believe it's you.  I'm like, it's me.  Yeah.  And then they start asking personal questions, and you answer them.  And they're like, oh, well, you could have read that on a message board, like I did.  All right, then how are we going to prove this?  I'm not talking to you.  You want me to call you? 
[00:08:00]  What do you want from me?  I'm trying to play a video game.  Your phone number's part of your name.  I'm going to play it online.  You have to play any games online.  I just can't do it.  It's fun.  No?  It's fun, man.  Now it's just all about online.  I can't.  I really.  There are a few games I can play single player anymore.  Most of it.  Got to get online and just start beating up on, you know,  eight-year-olds that are better than you.  I like having fun.  Like, it's too real.  It's crazy.  I don't even play Madden anymore.  It's like real football.  Like, where's, and there's no more cheat codes anymore. 
[00:08:30]  Like, where's the cheat codes?  You can't cheat on, well, you can, but they blew you off a lot of servers.  They get really pissed.  They're all about catching the cheaters online as best they can.  Yeah, they got software on a lot of servers.  You see the graphics with the John Madden?  The new one?  Holy crap.  You start feeling sorry when there's an injured player down.  You're like, what the hell did I do to that guy?  I hope he's okay.  They're taking him off the field.  You know, I think we talked about this.  I'm more of a fan. 
[00:09:00]  I think Anthony brought this up.  I'm more of a fan of the cartoony stuff because it doesn't, or is it my brother?  It might be my brother.  Yeah.  Brother Elmo on MySpace.  He's always looking for friends.  He's more of a fan of cartoony games.  He doesn't like that it's getting more and more real looking.  Like you said, when you were in the half-life days where, you know, these people are pleading  for their lives and the facial expressions are getting a little too real.  They were all cartoony at first.  It's like, oh, Gordon, go down this hallway, Gordon, and find a, you know, so you do that.  And the scientist was like this cartoony guy. 
[00:09:30]  So if you blasted him, you know, yeah, whatever.  Now they're all like, oh, why are you killing me?  Ah, stop it, please.  I have a family.  Yeah.  Like, Jesus Christ, dude, you're making me feel bad.  I was like, crack you over the head with a crowbar.  And then Call of Duty 4, you know, that's all about you.  You get online and just, you know, when you shoot somebody, they don't just fall down.  They might go down to one knee and slowly look up at you and then topple over. 
[00:10:00]  Jesus.  That was...  I got him good.  Yeah, they whisper.  They whisper, I have a family.  Mother.  Mother.  E-Rack's trying to turn me on to the new Silent Hill that just came out.  But the Silent Hill series went south.  That used to be a great game.  Yeah, that was a good one.  And then there was a couple of them in a row that it was obviously a new company or somebody  took over and completely changed the game.  And I blew it off.  But supposedly the new one's all right.  I don't know.  I might have to give it a shot. 
[00:10:30]  Yeah.  Sometimes they bring them back.  New engine.  Looks great.  I'm waiting.  There's, I guess, November 11th, a new Call of Duty.  Really?  Like an expansion or something.  It's all about Call of Duty.  Is that still the number one game?  That's a biggie.  It has to be right up there.  That's a biggie online.  Number one online game.  What is it?  Call of Duty?  Why am I asking E-Rack?  Can you look it up?  Stunt brain, look it up.  That's your gig.  E-Rack has eating for PlayStation.  It's a new game.  For the waste?  Yeah, yeah.  We actually use the Wiimote as a knife and fork and see how quickly you can devour your meal. 
[00:11:00]  He plays it online against other fat soaps.  Sorry, E-Rack.  Really not.  Yeah, all right.  Hey, I want to congratulate the Red Sox.  They advance.  Oh, yeah.  Although the people that care about that are sleeping because I'm sure they were partying all night.  Of course they were.  They moved on.  They get to face the Rays. 
[00:11:30]  The Rays.  The Devil Rays.  The Devil Rays.  Where are they playing?  What's a Devil Ray?  Where are they playing?  What the hell is that?  Fort Lauderdale?  Tampa Bay?  No, I don't know.  It's spring training all the time.  Why would you have a team in Tampa Bay?  That's like when the Marlins won twice.  It's like, did you really?  Who cares?  No one even cares.  What's a Devil Ray?  I don't get it.  Well, Florida has the worst fans ever.  They don't come out.  Well, you can't go out. 
[00:12:00]  It's 120.  The Dolphins are trying to get people to watch their games.  It's 120.  No one goes to see the Dolphins?  Well, they had a few lame years there.  I'm not a big Dolphins fan like Big Ken and Little Ken.  Little Philly crew mentioned.  But, yeah, they don't get a lot of people in the seats.  It's too hot.  It's still 100 degrees in Florida.  Five weeks into the season.  I guess so.  A 1 p.m. game is like 125 degrees.  And let's laugh at Stunt Brain today. 
[00:12:30]  Your dumb White Sox are out of it.  Yeah.  Chicago's gone.  I was watching the-  Old Chicago team's gone.  I was watching a little bit of that game.  Which one?  The White Sox?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And-  Why?  It was on the TV.  Yeah, at the bar.  Oh, at the bar?  Yeah.  So it's above, you know, the bar.  Mm-hmm.  So I'm watching, and there is a goddamn mascot.  Whose mascot was that?  White Sox.  It was the White Sox mascot.  Sitting right behind home plate, distracting the pitcher. 
[00:13:00]  Like, you know how they go crazy anyway.  Like, everybody's kind of, you know, waving their arms and stuff.  Mm-hmm.  But the mascot is in this stupid, like, Philly fanatic rip-off mascot suit.  Sitting right behind home plate, waving his arms around in that big mascot outfit.  Shouldn't be allowed.  No.  That should not be allowed.  The fans are one thing.  You know, you can't do anything about that.  But the other team, you know, whatever team is up against a team that has their mascot 
[00:13:30]  behind home plate, waving their arms, ought to send someone in to punch him in his foam  face.  His life sucks already.  Leave the mascot alone.  He's miserable.  What's the distraction?  It's ridiculous.  I'm watching this stupid thing just waving his arms around.  Yeah.  Ugh.  Mascots.  What a waste.  Is there one cool mascot?  No.  I think we did this bit.  The coolest mascot, Patrice.  The green monster.  Well, they booed him.  They shouldn't. 
[00:14:00]  They were not happy that the Red Sox decided to get a mascot.  Look, it's the green monster.  You know how traditional Boston is?  They don't want change or anything.  And they bring a stupid mascot called the green.  They name it after a wall.  I actually was at that.  I believe I was at that game when they introduced him or it was early on in his career.  I wonder what they call him.  Oh, man.  Wally.  Wally.  What racial slur do they call him?  Oh, sure.  It's a garbage.  Well, they probably just pulled out the N-word. 
[00:14:30]  Just for the hell of it.  Right.  They just sent the same racial slur.  They call him Jolly Green Giant.  I know there's something.  There's a green racial slur.  It's the green end.  You booger.  You call him snot.  Yeah, they were not into that.  By the way, the top online game is Halo.  Still Halo?  As far as Xbox goes.  And then Call of Duties, too.  Yeah.  Halo.  Grand Theft Auto is right up there, of course.  Never got into Halo.  I bought Halo 3 and didn't even unwrap it. 
[00:15:00]  Yeah, it's like...  I had to get it just because it was the hype of it, but I haven't messed with it.  Any time you go over someone's house and they have kids' halos on, you can't see any self-respecting  adult playing that game.  Whose house are you going over?  Little kids' houses.  No way.  No, like...  Every once in a while, Anthony just becomes a regular person.  I was just like...  He went to the bar.  That was when I was at a party.  Go to somebody's house.  That was when I was at a party at someone's house over the summer.  Yeah.  One of my mandatory parties I had to attend. 
[00:15:30]  I can imagine.  Yeah, believe me.  Just hugging a beer in the corner.  I believe that's what I was doing.  I hope not to be recognized.  And I just walk in and the kids are playing Halo.  Talking in another voice.  You're at a family...  So I hung out with the kids.  You're at a family party going, what the hell did I get myself in?  What am I doing?  What am I doing?  I don't know anybody.  I got to make conversation.  Right.  Peace.  All right.  We'll take our first break.  Well, Kramer's telling us to get out of the market.  Thank you, Mr. Kramer.  Get out of the market, Jerry.  Thank you, Mr. Kramer. 
[00:16:00]  We'll talk about that next.  Yeah, Wall Street, that was a lot of fun to watch yesterday, huh?  Wow.  We'll get into that after the break.  877-212-ON-A.  Stay there.  Remember that.  We'll all take a peek at that.  Oh, yeah.  Want to feel old?  Um, no.  Little things that pop up on the prep sheet that make you think, holy yes, the time is  just flying by.  Yeah.  We like to do this from time to time.  Barry Bonds, he hit 73 home runs, right?  Yeah.  What year was that?  How long ago was that? 
[00:16:30]  Uh, 2007.  2007.  2004.  You want to try 2001?  What?  That's seven years ago already.  Oh, was it?  Yeah, that's why we do the bit, Patrice.  And I remember 2001 only based on 9-11.  Of course.  That's the only reason I have a clue of what 2001 is.  Yeah, I know.  You know, that's absolutely right.  Anytime I think 2001, it's like, okay, that's what 9-11 was.  And then you just remember whatever.  Travis was saying inside, I believe it was Travis. 
[00:17:00]  It's kind of early, you know, when we're in that office.  Five years ago, Schwarzenegger elected mayor.  Wow.  Elector mayor, governor.  No kidding.  Yeah.  Five years.  Five years?  Yeah.  Just like that.  He went through just an action movie star.  And he ran off the platform of his movie quotes.  Yeah.  That was what he did.  Yeah.  I'll be back. 
[00:17:30]  He was using it.  He was.  Every time he stepped up to a mic, it was a movie line would come out.  Yeah.  If you think I'm going to raise taxes, you must think I have a tumor.  It's not a tumor.  I thought you just had to.  Wow.  I want to be your governator of California.  Yeah, he did that for real.  Your governator.  Wow.  I lost a lot of respect for California after they voted him in, man.  Sure.  A whole lot of respect.  Hey, speaking of movies, you were having a nice conversation there during the break. 
[00:18:00]  Oh, you know, I was thinking, I was sitting around last night, you know, just watching  TV like I usually do.  Patrice was giving me a quiz.  Watching Cinemax, who has turned into the I Am Legend network, by the way.  Yeah.  For some reason, I Am Legend is on every second of the day.  And I watched it again.  And after I did that, something else came on.  And I was, I just asked, I was asking Anthony, what, what movie have you ever watched where  you really looked at the woman and went, I, she's the boss. 
[00:18:30]  I'm following her as the boss in the movie.  There's no, there's no believable strength.  You're not sitting there going, ugh, move over, chick.  Or you're not sitting there going, oh boy, you know, movie magic.  Yeah.  You said the exact movie that I was thinking of.  Alien.  Alien.  I'm specific and say aliens.  Aliens.  Aliens, she was, she kind of was, she wasn't leading anybody. 
[00:19:00]  I'll tell you what the thing was with Alien, though, was the fact that you absolutely thought  Tom Skerritt was going to be the honcho in that one.  You thought Tom Skerritt was going to be the lead guy, the guy that was going to, you  know, kill the alien.  And he had the most, he had the most vaginal death, which was that, which was the, a big  hug.  He died from a big hug.  The alien gave him jazz hands first. 
[00:19:30]  And then, ah, cha, cha, cha, jazz hands in the ductwork.  And that was it.  It was horrible.  The jazz hands and the little mouth inside the big mouth.  Yeah.  That's it.  That was it.  But I'm specific to aliens.  And when I say this, because I always have these conversations, remember my girls sit  up and watch TV and she desperately wants to be cool.  Yeah.  Like, she just wants to be cool and like a dude.  Like, she looks at dudes and goes, damn, I wish I had a swagger like dudes.  I wish I, everything was cool. 
[00:20:00]  Yeah.  And I'm like, you're not cool.  You're, your, your problem is you're trying to be cool like us.  And, and, and I watched Kill Bill, which is of course would be a woman's movie.  Like, yeah.  But as a man, you're just sitting there going like, oh really?  Did you just chop up for, really?  Did you just beat up Mike Madsen real quick?  Yeah.  Like it was nothing.  Did you just punch your way out of a grave that Michael Madsen put you in?  Yeah.  Nice talking to you.  Not too believable, but you're, you're, you're believing in the aliens. 
[00:20:30]  But, but, what, the suspension of disbelief, I believe in the, but the way they approach  aliens is that she, she wasn't, she's reluctant, but she's, you go, she is the most qualified  right now.  Yeah.  At least she took the reins and you go, she's my leader.  In the movie, I'm following Sigourney Weaver the way she is.  I don't, she's like, get out!  She just, it's so, like, it's so authoritative, it's so, like, it's just, she's the, she is 
[00:21:00]  the most believable woman lead, like, in a movie I've ever seen.  Yeah.  Without, without challenge.  I mean, there's other movies where the woman is, I don't even know, like, anything that,  oh, anything that, what's Brad Pitt's mother's name?  Oh, Angelina.  Angelina, right?  Brad Pitt's mother's name.  Yeah, goalie.  Everything she plays, you just want to just throw up.  Yeah.  Wanted. 
[00:21:30]  She's just.  I'm so with you on that.  Bullets is going around the corner.  It's like, yeah, trying to be James Bond with cans.  It's just, it's unbelievable.  With lips.  Yeah.  At least Kill Bill had a fun, like, wink, wink.  Yeah, it was sort of tongue in cheek kind of thing.  Right, right.  You like the Kill Bill movies, though, right?  Yeah, because the way they approach it is cartoony.  It's a very.  Yeah, yeah.  But in terms of a chick running the show, Aliens is really.  Is it?  And so me and my girl are watching American Gangster with Denzel. 
[00:22:00]  Yeah, yeah.  And, you know, it was a scene where I'm watching my girls just sitting there.  And she just wants.  I don't know where it's a problem.  She wants to be.  So we're watching American Gangster.  And there's a scene where Denzel, who's playing Frank Lucas, biggest coke deal.  He went to get his coke from Vietnam.  Uncut Vietnam.  Not coke.  Heroin.  Uncut Vietnamese heroin.  You know?  So he gets so much heroin, he ends up selling to the mob.  So Armand Asante playing the big mob boss. 
[00:22:30]  And his wife and Armand, they're having dinner or lunch at some place where they're going,  pool!  Yeah.  Some skeet.  Skeet shooting.  Crap shooting, yeah.  So it was his wife and then Denzel and his wife.  And then Armand looked at his wife, gave a little wink.  And she said to Denzel's wife, I thought you want to see the rest of the house.  Come on.  And Denzel's wife looking at him like, what do I do?  He's like, go ahead with her.  And my girl's like, see, how come I can't be cool enough to sit there and listen to 
[00:23:00]  the heroin talk?  And I'm like, I'm like, because you're not.  Like, the coolness is, all right, baby, go, you know, the wink.  Yeah.  Your coolness to me is that you're my second in command.  Yeah.  Like, you're the girl in my life.  Take her.  Take the other bitch with you and get out of here because we're going to be talking some  drug dealing.  The coolness is that you know that I'm a big time heroin dealer.  Yeah. 
[00:23:30]  And you're a girl.  God damn it.  That's so true.  She wants to sit there and cross her legs and light a cigarette with us.  Yeah.  Like, yeah.  Huh?  And talk.  And talk and go.  Talk at a turn like Tony Montana down in Columbia where he's just yapping.  Well, what's his name?  Omar is.  Tony, shut up, Tony.  I'd be hanging out that helicopter in no time.  Dipping her fingers in orange water. 
[00:24:00]  Eating the orange.  I brought you in this business.  Shut up.  Right.  Right on.  I'm trying to think of another movie.  I'm telling you.  You see how fast you came up with Alien?  Yeah, because that was always like the.  That was it.  I can't even think of it.  Where a woman is just.  It's her.  Her thing is so.  The strength of it.  Like usually like women.  You know, I feel bad sometimes for what they go through. 
[00:24:30]  And I was sitting down the other day.  And, you know, I talk about this sometimes.  It's just the idea of the helplessness.  That they.  That out of control.  So a beautiful woman, you figure like this.  20 guys a day hit on her.  A beautiful woman.  I'm being.  I'm low balling it.  Yeah.  So 20 guys a day hit on her.  So you figure that's about almost 8,000 men a year.  And she still feels helpless because with all those choices, it still really isn't up to 
[00:25:00]  her.  Ultimately, it's still up to us.  And the thing that hit me the other day is that I thought I had to take a number two.  But I really just had it.  No, I thought it was one.  What's one?  A two is.  One.  One is that.  Okay.  Yeah.  I thought I had to take a two, but I just had to take a one.  So I'm sitting.  I'm sitting.  I'm sitting down.  Oh, I gotcha.  Just peeing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And I just felt miserable. 
[00:25:30]  Yeah.  You don't want to.  I felt.  It didn't seem right.  I felt helpless.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's not cool to sit down to pee.  No.  Just say sit down, just in case.  Sorry.  It's not cool to sit down.  Yeah.  It's like when you stand up, you're just like, you're looking back and you're going,  I wish somebody would come up on me.  It's a warlike.  There's one reason you sit down on the bowl.  And that is for the number two, as they say.  But yeah, I've been in that circumstance where you think, you know, your stomach's telling 
[00:26:00]  you, man, I think I better go sit on the bowl for a little bit.  And then you realize, no.  But then, and then you're sitting there, making that sound, that girly sound.  And it's tucked between your legs.  And you're just like.  The guy's sound is great.  The altitude gives it like that just standard sound.  It's a strength.  Yeah.  And then the girl's sound.  You can do other things while you're doing it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The girl's sound is. 
[00:26:30]  It's like, what the hell is that?  What kind of sound is that?  I don't, I don't know how they can be.  I mean, this all goes to the Sarah Palin thing.  It's just, you just, I look at Condoleezza and not because she's black.  It's just something about her that seems like she has a shotgun under her dress.  It's just like, it's something about her, man. 
[00:27:00]  But she had to sacrifice like sensuality and woman, kind of her womanliness.  Because Sarah Palin is still embracing this womanly thing where, you know, she's a mom.  You look at her and go, well, there's a mom.  There's this mom.  She's trying to be vice president.  She's, it's all about like womanly things when she gives her speeches.  But Condoleezza is all business.  She gets up there.  She's in her smart little frigging business skirt. 
[00:27:30]  She took whatever natural like emotion of a woman.  Right.  And turned it into the, into the, the stare.  She has a thousand yard stare.  Oh yeah.  And you look at her and I look at Condoleezza again.  I'll turn anything racial in a minute, but it's not even that.  No, no, it's not.  You just go.  Yeah.  Like, you know that when she goes over there and talks to Iranians and that they go, they  try to treat her like, like a chick.  Yeah.  Just, she's, she'll have none of it. 
[00:28:00]  What?  She gives you the look of disgust.  Like, what are you doing?  Right?  Like, don't, am I, you know what I mean?  Like, yeah, I'm with you.  You know, like, but, but Palin just has that.  That's why I brought that up.  Cause I'm, I'm going, I never seen a, it's, it's rare.  You see a girl that you go, my leader.  Yeah.  Please.  I'll follow you.  Hey, let's, uh, let's move on to what there's so much to do today.  Uh, Jim Cramer is telling everyone to get out of the market.  Yesterday.  Yeah. 
[00:28:30]  At one point, what?  The market was down 800 points.  Yeah.  Something like that.  Yeah.  And then it came back a bit.  A little rebound.  Who's Jim Cramer?  Well, Jim Cramer is the mad money guy.  The mad money guy.  He's, uh, he kind of, he kind of took off.  He got, uh, he got very, uh, hold on.  Hold on.  He got very, uh, popular in the market giving advice and, uh, got his own show.  And for, you know, a year he's just been, uh, praising the market.  Get in there.  When the, when the market took a dump, he's like, oh boy. 
[00:29:00]  Yeah.  Great buy opportunity.  Uh huh.  Well, he finally.  Is he big in the Midwest?  He's big everywhere.  Yeah.  He's got, he's got his TV show.  He's got a wacky TV show with wacky sound effects and he's yelling all the time.  Yeah.  Okay.  All right.  And then he, um, he, uh, yesterday said, look, uh, if you're gonna, uh, need some of  this money for like the next five years, get it out of the market tomorrow.  Yeah.  He just had everybody panic.  Yeah.  But if everyone takes it out, I mean, it's, you've lost a lot of value. 
[00:29:30]  Like, what do you do?  Yeah, I know.  That's just it.  I mean, that's, see, he's saying if you need the money, right.  A lot of people have money that perhaps they need.  Right.  Uh, and he's saying, unless you can let it sit there for five years, take it out.  Cause it's not going to do anything in the next five years.  I don't agree with that.  I don't know.  I still, I still think this is a lot of panicking over something that isn't real.  There is substantial stuff here.  I mean, the, you know, the real estate, uh, these, uh, all the credit problems, but it's 
[00:30:00]  not this huge situation where people should just panic sell every frigging sector in the  market.  It's crazy.  If you wasn't told, if somebody didn't tell us that we should be worried, would you, would  something be happening to you right now that would make you worry if somebody didn't like  I look at the gas prices.  And I remember when I was a kid into sneakers, when I was sneakers first, when I knew about  sneakers, got jobs and to buy my sneakers, sneakers were 30 bucks, 29.99. 
[00:30:30]  That's how much they were.  Yeah.  Then all out of nowhere, Jordan's just come out and they're a hundred and it was shocking.  Yeah.  Yeah.  People cry.  It was the news on the news.  They were saying, Oh my God, a hundred dollars.  Sneakers.  The Reebok pumps went up to, they were 179.  The pumps were 179.  And it was like, Holy Jesus.  No.  Right.  Yeah.  Then right when it was Holy Jesus.  No, they went down to 90 and people went, Ooh, but 90 was ridiculous. 
[00:31:00]  Yeah.  So the pimp move is this.  It was dollar 10 for gas goes up to two.  Then it goes up to five and we're going to kill everybody.  And then it's down now to about 270.  And that's where it's hovering around $3 right now.  It depends on where you go.  Obviously.  Yeah.  The barrel is down to what?  80 some odd bucks a barrel now.  Yeah.  It took, I think 89 or something.  They said that's the good news with this whole financial crisis is the fact that, you know, 
[00:31:30]  gas is getting cheaper.  Yeah.  You know, but, but, but it's still, but we're still victimized.  But we're still in, we're still paying.  I get what Patrice is saying over a dollar more than we're used to paying, but now we're  happy to be paying three.  Right.  And that's where it was.  Because four is fine without rain.  Yeah.  That's how, that's how it works.  And by the way, that's a black thing with the sneakers.  Whitey has one pair of sneakers that they wear out.  I'm trying to use my experience, but it's like, it's, I don't get the black culture with  the sneakers.  But I don't get the white, the thing I always, it's just different things. 
[00:32:00]  White people spend all their money on sneakers and maybe some rims and white people will  buy a life-size replica of Superman for $10,000 and think that that's a noble, like, but you  have your white things.  It's just stopping.  But you buy, you guys buy sneakers.  And you, Patrice and I have talked about this.  I'm not sure if we've talked about it a lot on the air, but you'll buy sneakers and wear  them like twice.  And then like, yeah, these are done. 
[00:32:30]  Yeah.  They lose the shape.  So then what happens?  They just, they throw them out or you just throw them in a closet.  Put them in that box, in that box, the, um, Goodwill box or.  Oh, there you go.  But he wears sneakers at twice.  Yeah.  Twice, three times.  And that's it.  Nice boots on there.  And sneakers that they.  These are my boots.  Yeah.  It's time to go.  When did you, when do you decide to wear them?  You know what I mean?  Like you've got these nice sneakers that you know you're only going to wear twice.  You know, what goes through your head?  Like today's the day I'm going to wear my sneakers.  Which are outfits.  Some sneakers don't hold up. 
[00:33:00]  Like.  What if no one looks down that day?  Air Force Ones are, they're, they're almost disposable.  They, they just.  And those are the big sneakers.  But you wear, you only can wear Air Force Ones.  Yeah.  Three times at the most.  But like a pair of, of, of, um, Adidas, well-made, Shelto Adidas, you can wear them for about  a year.  Mm-hmm.  Um, certain sneakers.  But the idea is, you know, it's a, it's, the word's fresh.  You gotta, you know.  What if, what if you can, what if you can keep your sneakers looking fresh and, and like  they're brand new?  What, with polish? 
[00:33:30]  That's when you ain't got no money.  Let me tell you what money, money does.  Money, I have, I'm a hundred air.  I can, anything in the hundreds I'm okay with dealing with.  I, I'm a hundred air.  Sneakers, it, it, it's fine.  I'll, I'll buy sneakers at any point, at any time.  And, and just, it, sometimes you don't want to worry about certain things.  It's almost like, remember when you had no money and you had to be creatively romantic? 
[00:34:00]  Only poor people have to be creatively romantic.  Think of ways to write your own poems or, you know, you just have to be creative.  You have to be, you have to think.  That's a great point.  When you have money.  You're like, ah.  You go here.  Here, here's a day at the spa.  Exactly.  When you don't have money.  Old days, it was a scavenger hunt.  You have to, you have to cut a, you have to cut a picture of her face out of aluminum  foil and it looks just like a, you don't need to do that.  So when you have a little dough, you can do what you want. 
[00:34:30]  And what, what you want to do is buy fresh sneakers.  All right.  Yeah.  That's all.  Before we move on, but it seems like a psychological thing.  Because, uh, stupid me, I'm thinking if you brought in sneakers that you wore two, three  times, I would say they're brand new.  Because of your sneakers.  But how would you know that they're not brand new?  And how would others know that, oh, this guy's wearing sneakers.  He's already worn twice.  That's crazy.  Because they start to be shaped like your feet.  Just like that.  Let me see your shoes you got on now.  You're going to laugh.  They're over.  I'm not going to laugh because you're white. 
[00:35:00]  They're over a year old and I don't care.  So if a black guy wore those sneakers, these are my, even though the style right now for  the young, young brothers is white guy-ness, is these tight, um, dress like skateboarder  kind of thing, wearing the crazy t-shirts with the skulls and stuff on it.  They're dressed kind of white.  But, um, that right there in terms of white world, I expect that.  You know what I mean?  I expect, you know, like a stunt, man.  He just, you know.  I got, I got, I don't know, three or four pairs of sneakers, but these are my go-to ratty. 
[00:35:30]  Hey, I'm going to work sneakers.  Who cares?  It's just a different world.  You just want to hug me?  You just want to look right, man.  You just want to look nice.  Here's what Kramer was saying yesterday.  So for investors, what is your advice today?  Okay.  Whatever money you may need for the next five years, please take it out of the stock market  right now, this week.  I do not believe that you should risk those assets in the stock market.  Even if you would take a tremendous loss in selling your stocks at this decline, you say, 
[00:36:00]  you take it out.  I don't care.  If you leave it, if you need it in five years.  I do not care where stocks have been.  I care where they're going.  And I don't want people to get hurt in this market.  But if you need it after five years, then don't touch it.  Well, yes.  If you have that much flexibility, I'm worried about unemployment.  I'm worried about your purchases that you may need.  I can't have you risk that in the stock market for the next five years.  Very dramatic statement, Jim.  Very dramatic statement.  I've thought about this all weekend.  And I do not want to say these things on TV.  Yeah, a lot of people follow Kramer. 
[00:36:30]  He's such a tool.  He really is.  He sounded like he was ready to cry again.  The stock market, you know, there's guys getting...  Anthony brought this up last week.  They are making money through this whole crisis because they know how to play this crap.  They know how to manipulate.  And then Joe Sixpack, like us, we're the ones panicking, taking our money out with tremendous losses.  Taking it out with a big loss and then buying back in when it goes up so you're losing money. 
[00:37:00]  And then there are guys, veterans in the business that have been on Wall Street for a while that just know how to play these things.  There was a guy I was just reading in the paper of, I guess, a 40-year veteran in the trenches down in Wall Street that's just like, why are people panicking?  Right.  What are they doing?  So who's killing themselves?  In the Depression, who killed themselves?  I don't know.  I think there's a lot of...  I think that's an urban legend as far as raining people out the windows. 
[00:37:30]  I think it's the average guy.  But it's people that have lost everything.  I don't think the average guy is...  It affects them, though.  This crap, yeah.  You have a little money, you throw it in your 401k or whatever, and you're losing money, and then people are bailing and taking massive losses.  So it is the middle class.  I'm starting to understand what the middle class is, so I really didn't know.  The guys on Wall Street with Kramer saying this, knowing that people are going to follow what Kramer's saying, they're sitting there like this with their hands like, ah-ha.  Good for me. 
[00:38:00]  Yeah, if you're wealthy, you don't have to worry about it, because you've got some liquid assets.  And if you're poor, you don't have to worry about it.  You're absolutely right.  It's that middle class that is taking their money.  They don't want to keep it in the bank with a crappy interest, so they put a little portfolio together and try to make some money with their money, or 401k through their job.  And then they look at their statement and go, oh, my God, I've lost so much value. 
[00:38:30]  Here's what's in danger.  Educated poor.  The educated poor.  The non-ignorant poor, the ones that have a little money, and they're going to take it and gamble with it and invest it.  And make some money with it.  Uneducated poor just has it in the bank.  Uneducated rich just have it in the bank.  But educated rich doesn't even matter, because they've got that kind of money.  Right.  And educated poor, these are the people that are in deep trouble. 
[00:39:00]  Also, to add to that, you can't be a panicky Pete if you're going to play the stock market.  Hey, Danny, could you punch me up a 10-year graph of the Dow?  Yeah, that'd be good.  Yeah.  Let me take a look at that.  Here's the rest of what Jim Cramer had to say.  Well, what is coming that makes you say that?  I believe that we could have as much as a 20% decline in the stock market.  If you can withstand that, of which most people can't, then I think what you have to do, if you can withstand it, is just ride it out.  Why do you think a 20% decline? 
[00:39:30]  Where does this number come from?  Well, I calculate the individual Dow stocks and see how far they could fall.  Retracing much of the move between 2000 and 2005.  So literally, I'm just counting Dow stock by Dow stock.  That's where I get it.  Hey, real fast, Bill from Comac, he writes, Barron's report in 2007 that Kramer's stock picks consistently perform worse than the Dow and the S&P 500.  Bottom line, the guy is a tool.  He's a hack.  So.  All right.  That's the 10-year? 
[00:40:00]  Yeah.  All right.  Look at the downturn.  It's no different than a couple of other spots where, you know, obviously 9-11 is right there.  That's that big dip right there.  Right.  And then we had a nice big climb.  It's been climbing since 2001.  It's been climbing, climbing, climbing.  It peaks.  It goes back down.  What do you think?  That's just going to slide back down to zero?  And guess what?  All the people that are smart enough to get in now.  Right.  Will be the people that like.  But who's brave enough to do that?  I know. 
[00:40:30]  That's the whole deal.  Yeah.  People who got a million dollars to wait for.  As disposable income.  Disposable.  So some poor dude's taking his money out.  Yeah.  Then it's going to be too late.  Had a big loss.  Hindsight's 20-20.  Somebody better invent a time machine and then keep it to themselves.  There's guys.  I know some of the guys.  And trust me, they are doing very well the last week or two.  Yeah.  They know what they're doing down there.  Here's my prediction for today. 
[00:41:00]  I don't know.  I'm talking out my crack.  But I believe the market will go up today.  I think we're going to have an upturn.  I think a lot of people know that a lot of these stocks are oversold.  What is the credit?  You know, there's mortgage problems, the credit problems.  They passed this bill for this huge friggin' bailout.  So what's all the panic about? 
[00:41:30]  People are going to see some bargains and start buying.  I believe you're right, Anthony.  We'll see you later today.  Yes.  The one thing I need is one guy.  We've got to get one guy.  We decide he's the guy that goes on TV and tells us all to get our money out of the bank.  Out of the bank?  That's all I...  That would be crazy.  Look, I already kissed my stocks goodbye.  You know, there's nothing I can do with them.  I'm not going to kiss my cash goodbye.  Right.  I'm lucky enough to be able to sit on my stocks through this. 
[00:42:00]  Yeah.  There's no way I'm selling anything right now.  But I really need to know when we need to get the money out of the bank.  If you have to go to the bank and take your money out, the country will be just in shambles.  I don't think I'm alone.  I think a lot of people out there are going, wow, is my money safe in the bank?  And when do I...  Wama Wurz.  Yeah, true.  When do I have to go down there and...  Bob's Bank.  If you're in Bob's Bank, I get it out and put it in a reputable...  I want to go to the bank with just pillowcases and say, all right, fill it up. 
[00:42:30]  Load it up.  Today's the day.  Give me everything.  About $10 million, I'd figure out something.  Not a safety deposit, but I'd just put it in the floor.  Yes, you put it in the floor.  I'd have my money in the floor and it's taking them out with rubber bands on it.  My girl asked me for it.  I'd throw, you know, hit her in the head with a $10,000 loaf.  Go buy my car with cash.  I mean, why would I care about having my money in the bank?  And the thing is about cash being worthless is like, if I have cash and you can buy things 
[00:43:00]  with cash, as long as you can buy things with cash, it can't be worthless.  Use cash.  Right.  But people just don't know.  And I think I'm at the age where I don't have the ability to learn anymore.  Like, I try to...  Whatever I was supposed to learn, it's in there.  It's in there.  That's it.  But if I try to learn the stock market right now, it'll just be useless.  Yeah.  So, you know, I just know what I know.  Just hang tough.  We got to take a break.  I think Sam's running in here with Jocktober. 
[00:43:30]  Ah.  We got a...  God, do we love Jocktober.  We got a station or a show out of Cleveland.  Oh.  That we're going to have some fun with today.  Also, after the break, we want to make RPI, one of our regular listeners, a star today.  He's got an OJ song that I think we can make a hit for him.  So...  We'll play it next for everybody.  Sounds familiar.  Opie and Anthony.  Good morning to everyone.  Opie and Anthony.  Patrice O'Neal in for Jim Norton. 
[00:44:00]  Let's take a peek at Leno tonight.  Norton's going to be on.  Yeah.  When Norton's not here, Patrice is probably my favorite fill-in, I got to say.  You give us a nice energy.  We like to follow your lead.  What?  Don't commit to that.  It's just nice.  You have access to a lot of young gentlemen.  Just accept the compliment.  I accept it.  But, you know, now you've got to deal with Bobby and Tom.  Well, Bobby's going to be in tomorrow.  And the guys we have in filling for Jim, we like them all.  I'm just saying. 
[00:44:30]  You give us a nice energy and we kind of follow your lead when you're in here.  This sounds very strange.  You know what?  God.  It's the guest mic.  They plug me into the guest mic thing because my mic is all screwy.  I think my module on the board.  Listen to it.  And I sound really stupid.  It's kind of this weird.  Muffled.  Muffled.  Yeah.  Muffled is the word.  I'm muffled.  Could you just pop me back where I was and I'll smack the mic every time it crackles?  Yeah.  That's how, you know.  I'll just smack the mic when it crackles. 
[00:45:00]  Supposedly we're a big.  That sounds like crap.  Supposedly we're a big radio show.  A big to-do.  But, you know.  Just put me back where I was.  No, just do it.  I don't care.  I'll just unhook him.  I'm not potting anyone down.  We got a mic we're in.  It has to go like this.  Let's be professional broadcasters.  Pot him down before I yank the cord.  No, that's not working.  I'm getting nothing.  All right, Ope.  Anyway, I'll do this show like this.  We've only been bitching about the mic for three or four days, you know. 
[00:45:30]  And then the company gets mad at me because I bitch on the air.  Okay, that's better.  That I like.  All right, just.  That's a good mic.  How about we try to fix the mic when we're not here?  Yeah, that should be.  I don't think anyone else uses the studio when we're gone here.  Top priority.  You know.  Top priority should be.  He's scooting in and scooting right out of here.  He doesn't want to deal with it.  I understand.  If Opie and Anthony's mic don't work and it's the Opie and Anthony show, that should be top priority.  But getting the mic to work on a radio show. 
[00:46:00]  Yeah.  The whole radio business is falling apart.  We're just making believe it's not.  We're making believe that it's not falling apart around us.  Yeah.  You know, and a few months back, maybe about a year ago now, they just fired a million people  in the company and just figured, ah, nothing will change.  And without getting too picky, trust me, I can list a whole bunch of things that have  changed since they fired a bunch of folks.  I said it's just like those Sim games, like Sim City and Sim Amusement Park, where you have 
[00:46:30]  to have people sweep up to keep the people happy in the amusement park.  You have to have the rides maintained or else they break down and people die in accidents  on the roller coaster.  And so that's what happened.  This is Sim Radio Station.  Yeah.  And they had everything working.  But then you get rid of a lot of people.  And then the amount of money you're spending goes down.  Yeah.  But things start falling apart.  Right.  Just like a game.  So now it's my microphone.  Well, it's just like I really don't see anybody in here anymore. 
[00:47:00]  No.  There's no way.  We could do this from our house at this point.  There used to be like a GM that came in every day.  Talked to us on.  There's no one in the hallways anymore.  We love Tom coming in, even with his dumb ties and his authority.  But it was nice.  You felt like you were a part of something.  But now it's like I don't know who does the show after us.  I don't know what format we're currently doing at this radio station.  I stopped keeping track a while ago.  You just come in.  Yeah.  There's no one here.  When we leave a little after nine, I see nobody in the hall.  They just come in the mail? 
[00:47:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  The check's in the mail.  Yeah.  I don't know who the boss is.  There's somebody they say is our boss.  But we don't see that person often at all.  I don't even see massages.  I haven't seen massages in a minute.  Oh, no.  She's coming back.  She's getting things taken care of.  Yeah.  She'll be back very soon.  But this is what's happening to the business.  We're pretty much the last dinosaurs walking the earth.  Here it is.  This is it.  We're it.  They fired everybody else.  They fired every other edgy show out there. 
[00:48:00]  Yeah.  We're the last edgy show.  Name another edgy show.  Seriously.  Name one edgy show.  On regular radio.  Skeeter and McGillicuddy.  Skeeter and McGillicuddy.  In Salt Lake City.  McGillicuddy.  This is it.  This is it.  We're the last survivors.  This whole radio thing is going to become something else and we'll be a part of it.  I'm sure.  We're just taking breaths as our nostrils poke out of the tar pit.  I don't think so.  I disagree.  You guys sound like this Kramer guy.  No.  A little panicky.  I don't think so. 
[00:48:30]  I think radio is just one of those things that's never going to be.  Patrice.  It's a new renaissance.  You need it.  Patrice.  We have been doing radio in New York City for 10 years now.  The difference in 10 years is unbelievable.  There used to be a lot of energy and people coming and going, all right, I know you guys  are in the middle of a show, but I need an answer on this and this promotion and this.  Now it's just like crickets.  It's just us.  And they're sitting there waiting for you to mess up so the boss will show up.  There's no boss.  There's nothing.  There's technically a boss, but I don't think, I'm not going to trash the person, but there's 
[00:49:00]  no boss.  We run the show.  There's no Tom G. Asano right now.  No.  Wow.  No, Tom was hands on.  He was let go to save money and they brought somebody else in, but this person runs a bunch  of stations and stuff and, you know.  Oh, really?  It's a babysitter.  What happened?  Yeah, a little, uh...  I'd tell you what this mic isn't on.  What happened?  You got it.  I'd tell you what?  I'd tell you what that mic.  Oh, that mic doesn't work at all? 
[00:49:30]  Uh...  What happened?  Well, exactly...  Is that one on?  Yeah.  Let Steve explain.  What's up, Steve?  Exactly what you're talking about is why we got yanked off BCN for about eight minutes  the other day.  Because there's one engineer servicing a bunch of different stations and he didn't know that he wasn't  supposed to yank one feed out.  Right.  Basically...  It just pulled the...  We were pulled...  Our plug was pulled.  Yeah, the plug was pulled.  Look, I understand.  I think we can bring it down to the, uh...  You know, the average person listening to the show. 
[00:50:00]  There's a lot of people that run businesses and they don't want to put money into the business  because they're trying to save money and it's a fine line.  You know, do I buy the new tables and chairs for my restaurant or do I give the place a nice  paint job?  Right.  But after a while, when you start cutting corners, it does affect the product.  You know, it's a balancing act.  Of course.  And we're starting to notice the other side of letting a lot of people go and not putting  money back into the product.  We're starting to notice.  That's all I'm saying. 
[00:50:30]  But we'll move on.  Patrice.  Damn, that's creepy.  Yeah, it is.  It's creepy.  We've had a microphone that's shot for three or four days.  The old days...  What happened?  Look at this.  There's just a piece of a wire, like, from the old...  It's not even...  It's not plugged in.  This part isn't plugged in.  It's just dangling in front of me.  I had to tuck it in here because it was blocking the view between me and Ope, so people step 
[00:51:00]  on each other.  Now it just sticks up there.  It's...  I used to...  It's like college radio.  Yeah, you know, the old school listeners, they understand.  I used to completely lose my mind when stuff broke down.  Now I just understand.  I just laugh.  I just laugh because I know what it is.  Yeah.  Like, we can bitch and complain.  Nothing's going to change.  You know, they'll...  It's just creepy.  This is creepy.  They'll fire more people.  What's going on?  You know, it's just what the business has become.  How do you know people are listening right now? 
[00:51:30]  We don't.  Every country is broke, is what it is.  We don't.  Every company is broke.  And who turns it on?  And who turns on this show at six?  We don't know.  You just come in and do-do-do-do-do.  And it's just...  Who does that?  We don't know.  We don't see anybody.  We have to travel from one station to another every day.  Like, we leave here and then we do the second half of the show somewhere else.  And there's no reason to be here anymore.  Back in the day, when we first started doing mornings here, it was like, okay, we need you 
[00:52:00]  here because, you know, this is happening and you've got to meet salespeople and Tom wants  to make sure, you know, you guys aren't crossing the line and getting yourselves fired.  Yeah.  Now we just come in.  Don't see anybody.  This is set up.  Our music starts.  We do the show.  We leave.  We just leave.  There's no saying hi to the next jock.  I don't even know who the next...  I swear to God, I have no idea who comes on after us.  The things that are leaving is what? 
[00:52:30]  Explain the demise of radio right now.  It's too technical.  People are probably going to some other dumb show right now.  Not even the technical part, but is it going away?  I mean, is radio done?  There used to be like a general manager for every radio station.  There used to be a program director for every station.  Right, right.  That's not the case anymore.  Now it's one guy takes care of eight stations.  And he's got to fly around doing shuttle diplomacy between all the stations.  There used to be a promotion department for every radio station. 
[00:53:00]  That's God.  Huge sales team.  Huge promotion department.  Remember, there used to be promotion departments where there would be a gaggle of people that  would just figure out promotions for the station.  Yeah.  Where you'd go out.  You'd have bar nights.  You'd do this, that, and prizes, all kinds of stuff.  Now they can't afford to fill up the van.  The van with gas.  The radio station van.  What happened to the K-Rock girls?  There used to be a time, like, the radio station van would have a whole schedule every day. 
[00:53:30]  Every day.  We're going to be here, here, here, and here, here, here, here, giving out free stuff.  Here, here, here, here.  Now they can't even fill up the van because the gas is too expensive.  Remember the K-Rock girls?  You saw them once.  Why aren't they supposed to be out doing a bunch of things?  Yeah, I don't know.  What happened to them?  I don't know.  Like, we voted on them, and the winners became the K-Rock girls.  And where are they?  Yeah, you're on the website, Danny.  What's the next thing they have scheduled? 
[00:54:00]  We haven't seen.  Is it on there?  We haven't seen them since.  We haven't seen them.  And we work for this radio station.  So in our frame of mind, wouldn't we be like, oh, wow, that's pretty cool.  The K-Rock girls are out and about, really promoting the station, promoting our radio show.  Yeah, you know, see who the girls are that we picked.  They're going to be at such and such a club tonight.  You guys are saying we're the K-Rock girls, but the K-Rock girls were happy, and they're  sitting around going, where's my duties?  Right.  What do I do? 
[00:54:30]  Look, I mean, if it's out of our, if it's off our radar, that means they're definitely  not doing much with the K-Rock girls.  Simple as that.  No.  We would just know, because we would just know.  Back in the day, at NAW, we knew what was going on without even trying.  So if we don't know who the guy is that's coming on next, I couldn't tell you the top  five bands this station plays when we're off the air here in New York.  I don't know what the K-Rock girls are doing.  I don't know. 
[00:55:00]  It's just such a weird time.  I don't understand.  It's just creepy.  That's just creepy to me.  Yeah, it's weird, because I'm going, who's in charge?  I remember.  Who flips the switch?  Why don't you put her in charge?  I remember when the memo came out, and they fired just company-wide a lot of really good  people.  I read this thing, and I went, ooh, this isn't good.  This is going to hurt us in the end.  This is going to hurt eventually.  Yeah, you're going to notice.  Oh, they'll save money right away, but eventually it's not going to be good for the business, 
[00:55:30]  for the company.  By the bottom line.  For us.  For us personally.  Have you ever met one of these bosses, like the ultimate, you know, as high as you can  go boss, who are interested in actually the art form of it, like their goals, that wants  to save the-  Used to be.  I think they're all just holding on and hoping for the best.  Now, you know, they just don't want to lose their gig.  Yeah.  So that, you know, they can go and, because eventually they just have to answer to the 
[00:56:00]  stockholders.  That's who the big boss is now.  There'll be nobody at the top that goes, oh my God, radio's gone.  Radio disappeared.  Like, there's no one that's going to go, oh Jesus Christ, radio's finished.  It's just gone.  So, we'll ride it out.  We'll ride it out and see what happens.  God damn, that's creepy, man.  I think that's why the, you know, the ethnic stations do very well, because it's like  the last line of people that are going to be getting into the technology end of things 
[00:56:30]  like iPods, phones that, you know, play your songs, play your music.  Satellite radio.  Yeah.  Wi-Fi.  HD radio.  All that stuff.  There's so many choices now, and, you know, it's very difficult to continue doing radio.  You got to have some kind of a commodity that can't just be thrown on an iPod.  Right.  I consider this show one of those commodities.  You can't just, you can't go to an iPod and go, all right, I want the iPod version  of Opie and Anthony. 
[00:57:00]  You know, it's got to be us or you're not getting us.  Well, social commentary, I think you're always going to need, you know, people need someone  to make things clear.  I mean, you can't just go on the iPod and listen.  I mean, I buy iPod books because I just don't read them, read books, so I try to listen  to Sidney Poitier's version of his own book.  Sidney Poitier.  And I just.  That fine actor.  Sidney Poitier.  And I just almost pass out as he goes, once upon a time.  So you just need somebody to go, all right, listen to Kramer. 
[00:57:30]  Yeah.  You just need that.  Sure.  I hope that you do.  I think radio will reinvent itself.  It'll become something different than what it is today.  Yes.  Absolutely.  I don't know what.  Destruction.  All right, listen.  Just get out of here.  Let's just go then.  We want to talk about this.  Shut it down.  We want to talk about the slave thing, but now I'm going to have to wait until after  the break.  But let's make RPI a star today. 
[00:58:00]  OJ found guilty, looking like he's going to spend the rest of his life in prison.  Yep.  I was listening to a lot of the talking heads on TV last night, and they're like, wow,  he is just, he is cooked.  He is done.  They're trying to figure out what his next move is.  There is no next move.  There's really no next move for OJ.  This guy is done.  His life is done.  Less than half of the 12 jurors said that they thought he got away with murder.  So they're hoping that. 
[00:58:30]  So it's less than, but you know that they all.  Yeah, but they're hoping they could turn that into something.  And the guys on TV last night, eh.  Eh.  Nope.  They're basically saying he's going to have to spend over 100 years in jail if he lived  that long.  They have to prove their shenanigans for OJ to get rid of him.  Yeah.  And trust me, they probably sat there with that judge in that room, and they made sure  every T was crossed, because they're not going to let people get out of it.  It wasn't another L.A. debacle. 
[00:59:00]  Right.  This was Vegas.  Even on the lowest level, there's a mandatory two-year.  Mm-hmm.  A mandatory two to 15.  Mandatory.  So he has some mandatory stuff.  The kidnapping is two to life.  How is that, though?  Two to life.  Two to life, depending on you.  It's either going to be two years or your whole life.  Yeah.  That's so dumb.  And he had found 12 felony counts, which is just amazing. 
[00:59:30]  And like I said, it's just felony kidnapping.  It's just I grab you, and I put you in a trunk, and I say, give me money.  Like, that's felony kidnapping.  Yeah.  Hostage for cash.  12 counts.  12 felony counts.  But it's tough to let a guy go that had a gun going into a hotel freaking room.  I don't think the Patty Hearst dude's got that kind of thing.  I understand.  But, hey, because we're getting off schedule here.  But RPI, I don't know how, but we want to make him a star today. 
[01:00:00]  He does great work for the Opie and Anthony show.  He's got a song called O.J.  Folsom Prison Blues.  Maybe he'll get into radio.  Well.  We have an O.J. song.  A little familiar in.  A little familiar.  So this is RPI.  We're going to try to make this a hit today.  I hear that karma coming.  He won't go free again.  He'll be posing like the Heisman when he showers with his friends. 
[01:00:30]  He's used to stuck in prison.  I wonder what he thinks.  The back end.  I was barely with my back end.  Now that the party's finally over.  And the sock is pink.  I'm ready for this, boy.  This is happening.  I hope he's like Ed Norton in American history.  I bet he'll need some stitches.  The first time he has sex.  They'll make him wrap the ball.  At least a time or two. 
[01:01:00]  And that gives a whole new meaning.  To the juice is loose.  That's what they call him.  Well, I bet Blake Goldman's laughing.  And smoking big cigars.  Without old Johnny Cochran.  He'll dive behind those balls.  We knew he had it coming.  We knew he'd have his day.  It's not important if you win or lose.  Until you lose.  And now sell 32. 
[01:01:30]  Is where they keep O.J.  There you go.  RPI, O.J.  Folsom Prison Blues.  Not a bad job, huh?  Yeah, a couple of shoehorns, but not bad.  A couple of shoehorns?  They get a lot worse than that with the shoehorning.  Oh, I know.  Out there in song parody land.  All right, quick break.  And we're going to get into some Jocktober stuff.  Jocktober?  We've got a show out of Cleveland that's just horrific, and we'll listen to them or, you 
[01:02:00]  know, some samples of what they're doing today after the break.  Opie and Anthony.  Knowledge.  Opie and Anthony.  Studio falling apart.  Debate tonight.  Another boring debate.  Who's this?  Who's debating?  Hey, you got the big boys tonight.  The contenders.  Who?  Obama and McCain.  Who is that?  Town hall format, though.  So they get to walk around and feel like they're just kind of hanging with the peeps. 
[01:02:30]  The town hall meeting.  Can I ask you a question?  It's little Sally from somewhere in North Dakota.  Hello, Mr. Obama.  But they're calculated.  They talk to the people ahead of time.  All right, yeah, you could ask that question.  Yeah, you could ask that one.  What are your plans for the youth of America?  Well, we have to invest in the youth of America.  It's our biggest resource that we...  Shut it. 
[01:03:00]  I ain't lying.  Oh, it sucks.  I get disappointed.  I watch all the debates, and you kind of want...  I was thinking about this.  You kind of want a radio war.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  You get two, like, big to-dos.  And they really go at it.  Dude, get out.  They're so polite.  Obama's...  They don't go for the jugular.  Deep, boring voice.  McCain has this high, boring voice.  Meh.  Brr.  Meh.  Meh.  Brr.  Brr.  Meh.  Brr. 
[01:03:30]  Meh.  Brr.  Meh.  Meh.  Brr.  So what do you think?  Brr.  Brr.  Brr.  Brr.  And neither candidate knows what to do with this financial crisis.  That's what I think is hilarious.  No, of course not.  They're just like us.  Like, humm-a-humm-a-humm-a-humm-a-humm-a-humm-a-humm-a-humm-a-humm-a.  Yeah, what?  Because he's been...  You know, either one of them who've been in politics for so long, they know the dynamic  of the financial world.  You like to think the president might know a little something.  They know nothing.  I know they don't.  They know how to keep their jobs. 
[01:04:00]  That's what they know.  That is the number one prime directive of a politician, is to keep your goddamn job and do not what you think  is right, oh, it's best for the country, but do what will get you elected again the next time around.  You know who's amazing?  Who's the other guy that's the villain?  Not Dick Cheney, but the other villain.  Uh-uh.  Uh...  Paulson?  No, the other big-time villain.  It's not George Bush.  It's not Dick Cheney.  The other one. 
[01:04:30]  Well, the other one is gone.  Rumsfeld?  Rumsfeld.  Yeah, he's gone.  He's been gone for a long time.  But he's been around.  Oh, yeah, forever.  Not the president?  For 30 years.  You look at pictures.  Like, he's just been around as a dude.  You look at pictures of Kennedy, and there's Rumsfeld in the background.  Just Rumsfeld.  Those are the scary dudes.  Like, he's not the president, but he's just a dude.  That's just...  Yeah, what up?  He's probably...  It's like Nixon, and then you just see Rumsfeld in the background again. 
[01:05:00]  It's like Zellig.  He's just everywhere.  He's probably been running the country for 30, 40 years.  Yeah.  And, you know, no one knows for sure.  Henry Kissinger, like, he's just...  Yeah, yeah.  Just like, he's just around.  He shows up every so often.  His voice has gotten so much worse than it used to be.  Now he can barely talk.  He's just like this.  I think it's a big problem that must be taken care of.  Wow, Henry.  You're gone, man. 
[01:05:30]  Now that he's been part of the American culture for 80-some-odd years, when is he going to  lose the dumb accent?  Okay.  I'll stop talking like that.  Right.  That's just dumb.  Let's get into some Jocktober stuff.  Jocktober.  Jocktober.  Here's the official sweeper.  A brand new one, by the way.  Happy Jocktober, everybody.  From your friends at the Open Energy Show.  I want to rock.  It's a celebration of hacky, pukey radio shows and DJs from across this great nation of 
[01:06:00]  ours.  Oh.  Oh, it's just the worst.  That sound is actually coming out from between her legs rather than her mouth, I think.  Wake up the crapola.  It's Jocktober.  There's a person stranded.  There's a show.  There's a show.  It's stranded.  That's funny.  Good stuff.  Hey, now, there you go.  There's a little improv stand-up for you.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, the hell  was that?  Happy Jocktober, everybody. 
[01:06:30]  From your friends at the Open Energy Show.  Ha, ha, let's all do it.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  There was no joy attached to that.  No, none.  Oh, my gosh.  And there you go.  We're ready for Jocktober today.  Sam's in studio.  Many stations celebrate Rocktober.  We celebrate Jocktober.  Oh.  highlight shows from around the nation with the jocks.  And, of course, we hope there's a hole in everyone.  A hole, that's code for the woman on the show. 
[01:07:00]  It's code for it.  There's always the hole, the fun kryptonite.  It's called the yield sign.  Yeah, the yield sign.  Yeah.  Anything that can slow any fun down, the hole will do it.  Oh, yeah.  And, Sam, does this show have a hole?  You bet it does.  You betcha.  You betcha.  We are looking in on the morning show.  Is that what they're called?  Yeah.  Just the morning show.  Just the morning show.  All right.  And this is with Trapper Jack. 
[01:07:30]  Yeah, he's kind of the captain of the ship.  Ah.  Sam, let me tell you something.  For any new listener, let me just fill you in.  Sam is a douche.  Sam is such a, he looks so innocent, but he is the biggest son of a bitch out of anyone  I've ever known in radio, by the way.  Anybody that's been involved in our show, that, like my whole career of knowing from  interns to people we work with, you are just a bastard. 
[01:08:00]  Well, that's quite an honor.  Thank you.  And, um, okay.  So Trapper Jack is the captain of the ship.  Yeah.  The beauty of Sam, by the way, it's stealth, too.  Oh, it is.  It's all stealth.  Yeah.  Jameson Cross is a nice guy, but he ain't fooling anybody anymore.  I've seen him talk with people where they actually think he's carrying on a conversation, cares  about what they're saying, is talking to them, and it isn't sarcastic.  And I'm just watching, oh my God, this person has no clue.  He's just being mocked and goofed on. 
[01:08:30]  Sam's notorious.  It's great.  All right.  So we got the morning show with Trapper Jack.  Trapper Jack.  Yeah, the captain.  The captain.  The info man.  What's the info man?  Who's the info man?  Well, I think the info man is, uh, uh, their announcer and I guess their news guy.  I didn't, he didn't really give out much info this morning, but he was there.  Every morning show has to have the captain of the ship.  Yeah.  Some kind of info guy.  Yeah.  That gets a little edgy in between newscasts, you know. 
[01:09:00]  Flazy.  Gets in on the discussion a little bit.  Oh, yeah.  And then you got the yield sign, which is, uh, the hole.  Yeah.  And also you got to have some kind of stunt boy.  Yeah.  And you got to kind of call him stunt boy or stunt this or stunt that.  I didn't hear any stunt boy, but that might also be because it's a soft rock station.  Oh, soft rock.  Oh, soft rock.  Soft rock.  So they're really keeping it safe.  This show.  The hole is Terry.  What is that?  Moir.  Moir.  Moir.  Moir.  Moir.  Yeah.  M-O-I-R. 
[01:09:30]  So Terry, uh, Trapper Jack and the info man.  Yeah.  It's out of WDOK in Cleveland.  All right.  That's WDOK.com for the visual today.  Oh, yeah.  So people can play along at home.  Let's, uh, punch that up and see if we can look at what they look like, Danny.  That'd be a pleasure.  I swear this is the first time I'm looking at it.  I'm laughing already because I just know it's not going to be here.  I know what this is going to be like.  It's going to be three people with their arms around each other smiling in some wacky  setting.  It's just the same crap. 
[01:10:00]  Oh, my God.  Is that her?  I can't see her.  That's her.  Can we get a bigger picture?  Or, um, okay.  Thanks.  I would never question, um, your abilities, Danny.  That's a way better Terry.  Yeah.  She's all right for a radio chick.  Yeah.  It could be.  Oh, wait a minute.  Hold it.  Hold it.  Okay.  I said all right.  I didn't say.  She's a better Terry, though.  Yeah, yeah.  She's an upgrade Terry.  Dude, anything is better than, uh, yesterday.  Terry Clifford.  Yeah.  Good old Terry Clifford got a beating yesterday for all you Rochester listeners. 
[01:10:30]  This is a haggard mom teetering on grandmotherhood.  Well, she's got the waterfall bangs.  Yeah.  The rest of the hair is permed.  I don't know what's going on.  The hairdo is, uh, very, very old.  She looks like the woman who was bit by Robert De Niro and K-Fear.  Ah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, right.  I can see that.  All right, well, and who else we got?  All right, let's look at, uh, either Trapper Jack or Info Man. 
[01:11:00]  Mm-hmm.  Let's see, uh.  She might be the, uh, she might get top billing, because when you pop up the website, there she  is.  Soft rock.  Oh, here we go.  Ah, here we go.  Now we're talking.  There's Trapper Jack.  Trapper Jack?  Uh-huh.  So, uh, how old would you put Trapper Jack at?  Oh, he's, he's probably, uh.  Oh, look at that.  All right, Trapper Jack.  Trapper Jack.  Oh, does he look like a ghoul?  He looks a little like Peter Gabriel. 
[01:11:30]  A little bit like Peter Gabriel.  He's probably been kicking around the Cleveland market for 20-some-odd years, I'd imagine.  King of Cleveland.  All right, why don't we, uh, get right into this here.  So, uh, Jack Tover, the morning show, yeah, with Trapper Jack, we got Terry.  Yeah.  Talking about her run-in with the law.  Now, this is weird, because that's Anthony's bit.  Right.  That's me.  I, I've talked many times about, uh, getting pulled over, and, yeah.  Uh, how it goes.  And why did you pick this break? 
[01:12:00]  Because it's very similar to how Anthony handles the, the cops?  Well, yeah, I just figured part of Jack Tover is kind of seeing maybe if our show needs to improve based on the techniques of others.  Uh-huh.  And then maybe we could pick up a couple tips from, uh, Terry and the gang.  Oh, God.  All right, here we go.  Listen carefully, Anthony.  I am.  Terry Moyer was, uh, stopped by a member of law enforcement.  The gendarme?  The gendarme, uh, gendarme John Goddard.  But I was wrong. 
[01:12:30]  You were wrong.  That's right.  You were 100% wrong.  And you told him, what'd you say?  As soon as he pulled you over, what did you say?  I got out my license.  I got out my registration.  As he walked up, I handed him the license and the registration, and I said, I was wrong, and I got nothing.  Assuming what?  What were you assuming?  Well, he was going to say, ma'am, do you know what you did wrong?  Yeah, I know I was wrong, but I actually didn't know whether I was speeding or what.  I wasn't sure what it was.  Or.  First observation, when you're talking about real-life stuff, you can't do it like this.  So, uh, you got pulled over to the door. 
[01:13:00]  Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.  You gotta, if you're gonna have real talk, you gotta use your voice.  This type of voice should just be, uh, you know, uh, introing records and doing weather forecasts.  Dave Mustaine's picture up there as a comparison.  A little bit.  I like that.  A little bit, a little bit.  The hair.  So there's, uh, there's the beginning of the, I got pulled over bit, Anthony.  Yeah.  So you know that she was wrong because she mentioned it four times in 30 seconds.  She said she was wrong.  But didn't know what she did at all.  Oh, really?  And she got nothing? 
[01:13:30]  Yeah, she said, I have nothing.  But she had no idea what she did.  She just knew whatever it was, it was wrong.  It was wrong.  Okay.  And so I said to him, I know the speed limit, I have children, and I know I should have  gotten up earlier if I'd wanted to pack those lunches.  Oh, good answer, Mom.  And he looked at me and he said, I didn't get you for speeding.  He said, you did not come to a complete and full stop back at that stop sign.  And I said, I know because I'm a moron.  And I said, and I apologize.  I mean, I was very contractual because I knew I was wrong.  I mean, what was I going to say?  I knew I was wrong. 
[01:14:00]  So he said, all right, well, I'm going to let you off with a warning.  And I said, thank you so much.  Well, that was nice.  That was really extremely nice.  And then he gave you more information.  And then he said to me, by the way, just for your information, we're going to be out all  week.  All these streets around here.  Mm-hmm.  All the streets.  Be aware out there today, there seems to be something in the air besides the fall weather  here.  Oh, my God.  Would you just kill yourself?  I would go home and just swallow a shotgun.  Pack those lunches. 
[01:14:30]  Oh, my God.  That took me a little while.  And you know, this guy wanted to be like the next Howard Stern or something, and now he's  just doing soft rock morning show.  Well, yeah, he's doing edgy radio because his co-host didn't come to a complete stop.  And she calls herself a moron, which is weird because their last name is Moore.  So Terry Moron, you know.  I wonder if they play off that.  Hall Hall.  Did she, was that what it was, rolling through a stop sign?  She just didn't come to a complete stop.  Oh, darn her.  Gosh darn it. 
[01:15:00]  Oh, wow.  It's probably Supercar Weekend for her.  Huh?  I can't tell you how many times.  It's probably a Supercar Weekend for her.  Yeah.  A Supercar Weekend.  I think we just depressed Patrice with this whole thing.  It's just bad, huh?  This is it, huh?  Yeah, this is what some people have.  This is all they have.  It's just, wow.  And they just, again, I did, you know, again, I come in every once in the blue moon.  Yeah.  And, you know, you just go, is it really, like, the, the child, like, okay, if you was, if 
[01:15:30]  they just weren't able to be fired, could you, would they be down to do something else?  Yeah.  If they knew, like this, you know, they're always at the threat of being fired, but he  just knows how to not be fired.  There's just no more fighting him, and it's just, and then this woman, a lot of these  guys, they get beaten down to the point that, you know, management knows they're going to  behave.  This guy will never say anything crazy or edgy.  And they just know.  He will never know the feeling of, like, leaving a radio station and wondering if you have a 
[01:16:00]  job the next day.  No, no.  He just knows.  Which, by the way, is a terrific feeling.  He's there forever.  He's there forever.  It's amazing.  He's there forever.  And then you get to call, like, in our case, I'll call Anthony and go, holy, as we skated.  Oh, God.  Oh, my God.  I hope we did.  Oh, my God.  Wait another day.  Right.  Well, don't, don't, don't jinx it.  How many times have we called each other?  I think we're going to skate on this one.  I think we made it.  Oh, ho, ho, ho. 
[01:16:30]  Hope so.  They bought our excuse.  Oh, God.  I can't watch this goddamn commercial.  What?  Old Vag Neck.  Yeah, why did they bring him back?  I don't know.  Well, I, I used to smoke so many cigarettes.  Not, we'll ever be the same again.  Not even the simple things.  You can do the, the voice box.  Just do it like this, Anthony.  Oh, that's pretty good.  It's, it's just horrible.  They show him swabbing it out.  And then they show him at the doctor's office.  I have to get checked every six months to see if the cancer will come back. 
[01:17:00]  And, and they stick a light down there.  My favorite part is when he uses the Q-tip to wipe out the hole.  Yeah.  He bleeds in now because he smoked.  He was smoking.  This is how they're getting people to quit here in New York.  Ugh.  He used to be a, a healthy boy.  And he used to swim.  And he can't swim anymore because the water would go in his neck.  Ugh.  And immediately you turn.  When I saw that, I couldn't. 
[01:17:30]  Ugh.  And they got one now.  You know, watch out because you're going to roll over and kill your baby.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Like, dude, why do I need this?  Yeah, there's too much else to worry about.  All right, let's get back to this terrific radio out of Cleveland, WDOK.  You can't get Trapper Jack on an iPod.  That's right.  Now, this is, now, the first was kind of them just kind of talking about their lives.  Right.  You know.  Is this the number one show in Cleveland?  I don't even know.  I don't know their ratings. 
[01:18:00]  Trapper Jack makes a Britney Spears joke.  Now, that's kind of brave and probably a bit edgy, I would assume.  Yeah, a little bit.  Any Britney Spears joke would be a bit on the edgy side.  Terry throws up the yield sign, though, and goes, now, now.  Oh, the hole steps in.  Okay.  Britney Spears has a exercise video coming out.  Yeah, she's going to do the Jane Fonda thing.  She is going to show you how she got back in shape and help you get in shape, too.  The gurney crunches are phenomenal.  They really are.  Oh, yeah.  She looks great.  She looks perfect.  She has really worked her way back.  No.  She has.  No. 
[01:18:30]  Oh, my God.  No, she looks great.  It's the same broad working on every single one of these shows.  That was their chance to have a little fun.  It's the same girl, the same voice.  No.  No, she looks great.  Oh, how dare you.  Gurney crunches.  I mean, you know, come on.  That's all right.  Oh, now.  She looks great.  Then we move on to Terry. 
[01:19:00]  Speaking of cars, Ford is going to come out with a smart key that if you program it as  such, you won't be able to drive over 80 in your car.  Well, the idea is for the teen.  That's right.  Apparently, yeah.  They won't be able to turn the stereo up more than halfway.  I love that.  I think that's funny.  That is funny.  And the stereo will go off automatically after five minutes if the driver hasn't buckled up.  Oh, I love this.  It will become disabled.  I guess Ford came out with the very first anti-theft chip that came out. 
[01:19:30]  So they're kind of expanding on it.  Can you set it lower than 80?  No.  Oh, shut up.  Set it for 10.  Can you set it for lower than 10?  It's lower than 80 so fast.  This is the bitch that's in front of me every day.  You shouldn't even be going 80.  Oh, that's driving like a maniac.  That's driving like a crazy person.  Oh, my God.  Can you believe it? 
[01:20:00]  Can you get it lower than 80?  They just look for news stories and say, what's the least amount of fun you could have talking  about this?  I would be fired for sexual harassment.  Oh, yeah.  And not because I pull out my junk.  I would just have to call her to see.  I would pull out my junk.  I would get behind her when she doesn't know, unzip, pull out your stuff there, and then  tap her on the shoulder so she turns her head and you hit her in the cheek. 
[01:20:30]  And then watch the sexual harassment charges pile up.  I would just ask her if she wants to smell my fingers every morning until she quits.  Just go away.  Let us men have some fun.  Dip your fingers in tuna.  Right.  And then put them under her nose and go, do you think I should tell her something?  Right.  Do you think I should say something to her?  I had a wild one last night.  Yeah.  Smell, Terry.  Oh, gosh. 
[01:21:00]  I'm going to HR.  Right.  Yeah.  I'm sure you will.  Wow.  Is she just anti-fun?  Well, I'm just interested in seeing the people, like, the people who listen.  Yeah, yeah.  Who's the regular listening?  Chuckling along in their car.  The face of a real fan of this show.  Yeah.  Just who are you?  Where do they go?  They go out to every one of their appearances.  Yeah.  Hi.  Probably bake them.  Oh, I've been a fan for so long. 
[01:21:30]  My name is Joan.  And I've been a fan for so long.  This is my friend, Sharon.  Hi.  Big fan.  Big fan.  I just love, Terry, how you keep the guys in check.  You know, you control that show.  You're the, you wear the pants on that show.  The guy's just sitting there.  The guy's got to sit there and just go, oh, I'm going to knock her in the head with a lug wrench out in the parking lot. 
[01:22:00]  I had dreams when I got in this business.  And now I'm with this broad and her yappy friends.  Well, we got a trivia question, you know.  Oh, I love trivia.  The real morning shows out there, they have to have a trivia question every morning.  You got to get the callers calling in, you know.  Of course you do, Sam.  Of course.  All right.  A leech has 32 of them.  Teeth?  I'm not telling you.  How about I got 32 teeth?  Well, I do.  I'm just telling you.  I do.  I gave you a clue.  It's not legs. 
[01:22:30]  Wait, we missed something there, Sam.  Oh, boy.  Well, the question is a leech has 32 what?  Oh, a leech.  Oh, okay.  A leech.  A leech has 32 what?  A leech?  Miles.  Uh, total alimony payments?  See, there you go.  Sure.  Even taking their crappy material and making it funny.  That's what we attempt to do anyway.  Thank you.  Who cares?  My answer would be, I don't care.  My answer is, you know, what are Opie and Anthony doing this morning? 
[01:23:00]  All right.  A leech has 32 of them.  Teeth?  I'm not telling you.  Well, is that her being edgy?  She's like, she asked a question, then he answers it, and she goes, well, I'm not telling  you?  Yeah.  What is that?  Well, the listeners haven't gotten a chance to answer yet.  And then they get, you know, you know, the second they get off the air, he's just like,  and if that goddamn Mission Impossible music is played any louder, you're out of here,  son of a bitch.  Like, he's just mad, so he yells at all of his staff.  You just know it. 
[01:23:30]  Uh, Tony in Cleveland.  Hey, uh, I don't understand why Trapper Jack's talking about Britney Spears, which he looks  like, because Trapper Jack is blind.  What?  Are you, you're kidding, right?  Way to go, Sam.  Guy's just trying to, like, make a living.  Can't even see anything.  Can't even see.  But he, but you know what?  He can't even see how awful his radio is.  He doesn't even give the dignity of wearing the, the comfortable, I'm blind glasses. 
[01:24:00]  Yeah.  No, it's just kind of...  He's forcing you to look at his unblind...  Well, you know, his, his publicity shot on the website looks like he's looking at the  camera.  I imagine they just put him in a room with a circle of cameras and figure one of these  shots will, will pick up the shot.  Yeah.  You knew that?  No, I had no idea he was blind.  Wow.  What does it say?  How do you know he's blind?  I mean...  Oh, yeah, that's it.  Is it in his bio?  No, it's not?  Well...  Trapper Jack is blind. 
[01:24:30]  Steve from Bayshore.  Yeah.  Steve from Bayshore said, I just did a Google search.  He is legally blind.  Legally blind?  That's different.  That could be any...  You can still see a little...  Like the governor.  Yeah.  Well, the governor...  Well, the governor's...  The governor's pretty effing blind.  He's pretty effing blind.  He's pretty...  He's blind.  Am I effing blind?  I don't know what he's looking at when, when he gets up there.  You know, I like that guy, though.  I really like him.  I think he's a good governor.  He's an honest guy. 
[01:25:00]  He's an honest guy.  He seems sincere and stuff like that.  But, God damn, I cannot look at him giving a speech.  Because he won't wear the make-me-feel-comfortable glasses.  Right.  It's not for you.  It's for everyone else.  Put the glasses on.  How do you like him?  He's black.  You can't like black guys.  Okay.  All right.  Now I'm up to two.  The governor and Patrice.  Admitted he did coke.  She did his wife.  You can't even...  There's nowhere else to go with it.  Yeah.  You know how...  This guy is smooth.  He's blind and he's cheating on his wife. 
[01:25:30]  God damn.  That is...  That's just amazing.  You're blind.  I thought it was you.  You should say that.  I tripped and fell into it.  Yeah.  All she did was grunt.  Same grunt you did.  All right.  Let's get the answer to the trivia question.  God, just selfish Anthony.  All right.  Here we go.  A leech has 32 what?  I don't know.  All right.  A leech has 30...  32 of them.  Teeth?  I'm not telling you.  How about I got...  32.  Well, I do.  I'm just telling you.  I do.  I gave you a clue.  It's not legs.  I have 32 teeth. 
[01:26:00]  You have 32 teeth?  Don't you start out with 32?  No.  And then they start removing them when you hit about 18?  Is that the way...  Hey, Jimbo, is that about right?  32 of them.  I'm looking it up now.  Shut up!  Jerry's laughing at me, right?  What?  There's nothing.  Enough!  Shut up!  Holy good God.  Enough!  What's the matter with you?  Enough about the leech!  Well, Jimbo is Info Man, so they were going to Info Man to find out how many teeth you have.  All right.  Info Man.  What's so funny about a guy saying he has 32 teeth? 
[01:26:30]  I have no idea.  What is she covering up with all that dumb laughter?  Don't you start out with 32?  No.  And then they start removing them when you hit about 18?  Isn't that the way...  Hey, Jimbo, is that about right?  32 of them.  I'm looking it up now.  Terry's laughing at me, but I think it's around 32.  You do not have 32 teeth.  No, of course you do.  I think you're right.  Yeah, right.  That's not the question.  Balls.  Who cares?  What?  What, Patrice?  32 balls.  Like, who cares?  Like, Patrice is getting angry. 
[01:27:00]  I love it.  32 things that suck blood off of things.  Like, what does a leech do as a slug that does stuff?  Just...  It's...  Yeah.  There's 32 reasons to hate you.  They spent about 40 minutes worth of talk breaks this morning taking phone calls from people  about how many, uh, 32 watt on a leech.  This was all morning.  And then they talk, right, long enough.  You know, it's not one of us has asked you what the answer is. 
[01:27:30]  No, why would you care?  Don't tell me.  I don't want to know.  The answer's not here, so...  Good.  I really don't care.  I don't know if you call it teeth or tendrils that suck the blood.  Suck the blood.  Those old blood-sucking things.  No.  How about blood-sucking things?  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  Oh, the holes are the worst thing in radio.  You friggin' holes.  But it's blood-sucking.  Ew. 
[01:28:00]  Yeah, ew.  No.  Patrice is just yawning.  32 yawns from this show.  How about blood-sucking things?  No.  No blood-sucking things.  Maybe some kind of suction thing that goes...  Ew.  And takes the blood right out of you.  Maybe it's some kind of...  I'm sorry I came off this question.  No.  She says ew.  There's nothing to do with blood.  There's nothing to do with blood.  Okay.  Nothing at all.  Great impression.  That ew was the same ew from those college girls walking home in Animal House after they 
[01:28:30]  went to the black bar.  But I liked him.  He was nice.  Ew!  No real woman does that.  Ew!  Ew!  Those sucking sound effects were a little gross.  Oh, yeah.  That was.  That was a little edgy.  Yeah.  Cleveland deserves this.  The barren streets of Cleveland.  Cleveland.  If this was another town, I'd be like, man.  Yeah.  But Cleveland, you deserve it.  Sam, there's two things you could do with this to pump it up. 
[01:29:00]  Try the bleep game.  Okay.  And somebody's suggesting Blue Heeler, of course, from Kentucky, isolate the hole.  One of our favorite things to do.  Let's do it.  And just see what she contributes.  What she contributed to their show this morning.  All right.  According to the breaks we just played.  I will do that.  All right.  Thank you, Sam.  Jack.  Oh.  It's all right.  Sorry.  We'll recover.  Oh.  Jack-tober.  There's your Jack-tober show for today.  I just feel like swearing right now.  I know.  I know.  It just gets you mad, right? 
[01:29:30]  It's infuriating.  I don't feel like.  I don't even.  You come in the morning, you've got to have, like, trying to be funny without cursing mind.  Yeah.  I don't feel like it right now.  I just want to curse.  I don't want to just curse.  It's just frustrating that they're using these voices to talk about the real stuff, and it's just bland.  Can I tell you if Anthony held out for just a year, that I'd guarantee I'd had a nice threesome with one of these CW girls.  They just are gorgeous.  It's a bunch of sexy CW 11 chicks. 
[01:30:00]  You selfish bastard.  You just could have hung in there, had a quick party, and ammo.  Yeah.  Well.  Couldn't do it.  Damn.  Couldn't hold on.  I mean, at this show, there's a lot of tender, and old tenders, too, like 35, 40.  Deliciousness.  Selfish.  Son of a gun.  You know what?  You should listen to Trapper Jack.  Trapper Jack.  Tie you down and make you listen to Trapper Jack for an hour for that.  I couldn't hold out any longer. 
[01:30:30]  Just to let him.  No, not to wheel you around like Silence of the Lambs.  Like Hannibal Lecter.  Just on a gurney.  On a gurney.  And just wheel you around and make you follow Trapper Jack.  A muzzle over my zipper.  Blind, boring life.  It'll serve you right.  We've got to take a break.  We're going to talk about dinosaurs, slavery, and the wig party.  Is that?  Wow.  Yeah, why not?  It's quite the smorgasbord.  Patrice is entertaining us during the breaks, and we'll bring some of that to the radio next. 
[01:31:00]  We'll close out Jocktober for today with The Sweeper.  Happy Jocktober, everybody, from your friends at the Opie Neckley Show.  It's a celebration of hacky, pukey radio shows and DJs from across this great nation of ours.  Oh, it's just the worst.  That sound is actually coming out from between her legs rather than her mouth, I think.  Pick up the crapola.  It's Jocktober. 
[01:31:30]  There's a person stranded.  There's a show.  There's a show.  It's stranded.  That's funny.  Good stuff.  Hey, now there you go.  There's a little improv stand-up for you.  Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha 
[01:32:00]  in Kentucky. Stephen S. from  Bayshore. These guys work  hard for the show every day trying to get  some lines in. I want to acknowledge  some of these people. That's what we  do now.  Patrice O'Neill in for Jim Norton. Jim Norton in  L.A. He's going to be on Leno tonight, so  we'll take a look at that. Yes.  And Anil, he doesn't even have to do any 
[01:32:30]  stand-up. He just comes out, sits  down. That's really cool. Chats.  Chit-chats. That's really cool.  Yeah.  Good for a little Jimmy.  Oh, really fast before we move on to a couple  other things. We just played  that dumb show out of  Cleveland. Yeah. And the whole  Terry. The whole. We had  Sam isolate exactly what she  did during those  clips we played. So this is  from everything we heard. Yeah.  This is her sole contribution. 
[01:33:00]  This is what she contributed.  Proving our point. Let me strap in.  For the most point, women  are useless on radio.  For the most point. Wow, ride.  Huh? This is going to be a wild ride.  Oh, yeah, yeah. Let me strap the F in.  Yeah. Buckle up. Here it comes.  Oh, the whole. We didn't have to  mess with the tape. Nothing.  We said, Sam, whenever she talks,  isolate it and make a montage.  And this is why women, for the most part,  should not be doing radio.  Because this is their role.  This is their role right here. 
[01:33:30]  Wow, that is literally  a role. There we go. Nothing.  I love that. Oh, I love  that. Can you set it lower than 80?  They really are. Oh, yeah.  She looks great.  I have 32 teeth.  She has 32 teeth.  No.  And then they start  with the blood sucking thing.  Ew, no.  How about blood sucking?  No.  Ew.  So it's not even going to go.  Ew.  There's nothing to do with blood.  I was wrong, and I got nothing.  That's what she did. 
[01:34:00]  Oh, that sums it up.  No.  Ew.  No.  Sarah Palin.  Yeah.  Is she flying under?  It's not like Sarah Palin.  Is she flying under the radar or what?  Oh, gosh.  My damn Sierra.  It's my car.  All right.  What are we talking about?  The one-man show?  What?  Slavery.  The one-man show?  Hey, I'm cooperating over here.  I'm cooperating.  Oh. 
[01:34:30]  Hey, do we have-  Oh, Wade, it's Gene.  Oh.  When he's practicing the phone call to Wade.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh.  Oh, Wade.  Oh.  Oh, geez.  It's Gene.  Oh, Wade.  And then he calls up, oh, Wade.  Okay.  Yeah, put him on.  He was ready to go.  He was all ready to go.  Ah, God damn.  Great movie.  Hey, if the boys are in the back, could they isolate some of the other holes we've already  featured?  Yeah.  Because now I want to do hole isolation.  Just hole.  Hole isolation. 
[01:35:00]  Come on, fast ready.  Iso hole.  Operation Iso hole.  Yeah, Iso hole.  No, you guys were talking about the one-man shows.  Oh, God damn.  That was pretty funny.  I was talking about it.  I was in Montreal and they, my one-man show, and I was just like, who's asking me?  Roland's like, you know, what the hell is your one-man show?  I'm like, the shows, my one-man show called My Jokes for an Hour, but I don't do them funny.  I hate one-man shows. 
[01:35:30]  Oh, they make me physically ill.  The most boring, pompous.  It's a pompous thing for a comic.  I'm doing a one-man show.  Yeah.  Every night when I'm off for an hour.  Yeah.  That's a one-man show.  It's you.  You're talking.  Why does it have to be this overly dramatic thing?  I, hey, man, you know, I had a teacher, Ms. Inez.  She was one of the great math teachers.  Hold on.  Let me go get my Inez wig.  Yeah.  So I can.  Right.  Good morning, kids.  Oh, wow. 
[01:36:00]  And the audience has to like clap.  And then I got to find some ditty that she gave me during my life.  Yeah.  You know, Inez, and I want to say to you children, that nine out of ten of you are going to be  homosexual.  It's like, I'm like, why isn't my jokes enough to be considered a one-man show?  It's a one-man show.  As opposed to turning into the guy at the car wash that tried to rub my leg.  Like, for what?  One-man shows, it's a selfish thing. 
[01:36:30]  It totally is.  You don't want to pay any other actors or actresses.  I'll do all the parts and hope that they buy this crap.  He's the king of the overblown, pompous one-man show that he thinks he's being so profound  and really opening people's eyes and minds to things.  When he sits there and imitates, like, the black guy from New Orleans.  Yeah.  Yeah, I had my horn, and I played it, and then Katrina came and took so many things away 
[01:37:00]  but couldn't take the spirit of my music.  Yeah.  The fourth wall, baby.  Shut up.  I don't want the fourth wall.  I don't want people staring at me for an hour with no reaction.  Yeah.  I'm just...  The audience is just in shock.  Just sitting there going, what is this?  Well, one-man show, it means lower your expectations before you come into the theater.  No set.  No other actors or actresses. 
[01:37:30]  When I was...  Just some different lighting.  20, I worked for a man that I thought was really obnoxious and stupid,  but I later learned that this man was very knowledgeable.  Well, let me show you a little bit about how he was.  But you've got to turn around.  You've got to turn around, and then the lights change.  The lights change.  The lights change, and then you turn around.  All right, get back to work, people.  Here it is.  Here's his boss, man, guy.  And it's just a lamp and something else at the desk. 
[01:38:00]  But you're such a great actor that you turn everything.  You can see it.  By my reaction, my reaction to a desk that's not there,  I actually bumped my knee into the magical air desk.  Magical air desk.  You could lean on it with two hands.  I'll never be a great actor.  Because you didn't want to pay the stage union.  So now there's an imaginary set.  No set, no cast.  I'll never in my life be a great actor.  I'll just watch actors and just crying scenes.  Again, it's I Am Legend week. 
[01:38:30]  Yeah, yeah.  So Will Smith cries like Dick Vermeule.  He just can cry.  Anybody who can cry is amazing.  But I go like this.  After I cry, like after I choke my dog, and I'm just like, please say hello.  If I can pull that out and cry, and then the guy goes, cut.  All right.  Listen, Patrice, we're going to do it again.  What?  What?  I just cried.  What?  Did you just see me cry?  Do you think I can take a take to cry? 
[01:39:00]  I just attached myself mentally to that dead dog, and now I'm going to cry again?  How do they do like 10 takes of go ahead, cry again?  Will you stop it?  Do it again.  Hey, full disclosure, because it's coming in on his feedback and on the phones now.  A Bronx Tale, which was Chaz's one-man show, was amazing.  It really was.  But I've seen a lot of one-man shows over the years.  And Whoopi's was great, though.  Really?  But that's the tip.  Whoopi's original was great, though. 
[01:39:30]  But that is a prime example of...  But hers was...  Oh, my God.  Oh, look.  She's playing a white little valley girl.  But it was out before...  Listen, man.  When she comes out around the world in a day, MFN day.  But that's before everybody got a hold of one-man shows and turned them into that...  I think it takes a special talent, and just about everyone out there trying to do it fails miserably. 
[01:40:00]  Is, I guess, what we're trying to say.  Because Chaz's was really amazing.  I heard y'all talking about it.  The John...  Luis...  Leguizamo?  Yeah.  I was dragged over one of those things.  Yeah, I can't stand him.  One of those things.  Anything he's in stinks.  Stinks.  Has he ever been a guest on the show?  Who?  No, no.  John Leguizamo.  We've said no to him every single time.  Oh, my God. 
[01:40:30]  Yuck.  Oh, my God.  You didn't, like, freak?  I was dragged to that garbage.  What was garbage about it?  I don't like anything he's in.  It's everything you're saying.  He was playing his aunt, his hoochie mama aunt, and his old grandfather, and his mama, and  him as a boy, and him now older because now he's looking into the future.  You know what the difference between Chaz Palminteri's one-man show is? 
[01:41:00]  It's a whole story, a continuing storyline.  Like, it's not really him just going off on these stupid, unbelievable characters that  someone's doing.  I generally don't support live performances.  Honestly, he's just that damn good as an actor.  Yeah.  This is what it comes down to.  Live performance just makes me sick.  Don't go to Broadway.  I've tried it.  It just sickens me.  Any live anything makes me cringe. 
[01:41:30]  Go see Young Frankenstein.  You ever seen a musical?  I went to see Avenue D, Phooey.  What the hell is that?  Avenue Q.  Avenue Q.  Avenue Q.  Exactly.  Wrong letter.  Musicals, like, the opening number, you're like, all right.  20 songs later, you're like, holy father of God.  All right.  Everyone has AIDS.  I love that one.  AIDS.  Who cares?  And then you pray for them to start talking in musicals, and they're like, okay, they're 
[01:42:00]  talking.  All right, good.  And there, you only talk for 15 seconds to set up the next song.  There's the big ensemble singing.  Oh, my God.  And then there's the solo.  The guy sings.  And then the girl sings.  And then the cast sings a big song.  Four.  And then there's the big closing number.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Don't.  I like that.  Don't.  Your curtain goes down.  You look at the playbill, and you do the quick math.  You're like, okay, they're doing the candle song.  The candle song?  Could be out of here.  Candle song?  There's 15 more songs to go? 
[01:42:30]  The 15th song.  You just start counting them down in your head.  All right, we knocked off another song.  Oh, God.  Enough.  Live music.  Yeah.  If it's somebody that has an album, I won't go see them live.  No?  I don't want to hear the ooh.  I don't want to hear any extra diddly.  The crap version of the song you like.  I don't want to hear diddly-doo in my song that I'm singing in my head.  I don't want to hear your artistic rendition of your own song. 
[01:43:00]  I say that all the time.  I don't want to hear somebody do their song unless it sounds exactly like the recorded version.  Live rap is unacceptable.  Oh, live rap sucks.  Live rap, except for two people, Run DMC, three, sorry.  Run DMC, LL Cool J, and Public Enemy.  What about Jay-Z?  You ever see Jay-Z?  I can't.  He's very close to his album, so I've seen him on TV, and his live performance was very close. 
[01:43:30]  So I can throw Jay-Z in there, but other than that, I just don't.  Live performances.  I went to, what did I go to see?  I went to see something where, what's the black lady on, she's on Law & Order.  She's like the detective.  No, she's like the boss.  She's like the lieutenant on one of those shows.  I don't think it's, well, whatever, I don't care.  She did a, it was just like, no, no, no more.  Avenue Q, I don't give a, I just want to stand up and say, I don't give, I don't care. 
[01:44:00]  What else did I drag myself to see?  I don't, I'm surprised every time somebody comes to see me do comedy.  Every time.  AIDS F-er writes, musicals make me hate humanity.  I saw Les Mis.  Really?  Which is just like, oh boy, a period piece, and then they're just, oh God.  I don't get it.  Singing the whole thing.  The whole thing is just like singing. 
[01:44:30]  I saw Phantom.  Wow.  Oh, oh.  Phantom of the Opera.  If it's not Lon Chaney making that bald face, if it ain't him, I think I saw Robert England's  Phantom of the Opera, and it was, it was the dumbest thing I was, if it ain't Lon Chaney  making that scary, goofy face, I don't want to see, I don't, movies, I'm a big movie guy.  Yeah.  But live entertainment, I don't, I just don't get it. 
[01:45:00]  Ain't, uh, ain't cutting it for you.  No, man, I'm sorry.  I'm, I'm sorry.  I guess that's a, you gotta be, a certain mode.  You never get a good seat, you gotta stand the whole time.  I saw The Little Mermaid on Broadway.  How are you seeing all these?  What's going on here?  I had to.  Every time I, I've said I've been to Broadway, it's been because I've been dragged there  by some broad.  Yeah, let me think about it.  That's dragged me.  Did I ever go to Broadway?  Some broad, that's why they call it Broadway.  That's why they call it Broadway. 
[01:45:30]  Holy Jesus.  Broadway.  Wow, what a revelation.  You're absolutely right.  It's Broadway because some stupid broad drags all the guys to these stupid shows.  You make a good point.  I'm going to an off bitch Avenue show.  C, C word way.  C word way.  I'm sitting, I'm sitting here thinking, oh, did I ever?  Give my regards to C word way.  Remember me in Herald Square.  Give my regards to C word way. 
[01:46:00]  You know, you make a good point because I'm sitting here thinking, did I ever like search  out anything on Broadway and go because I wanted to see something.  Yeah, it was always a broad ex-girlfriend, a mother, a sister dragging you to something.  Worst thing I ever went to.  Was there one show you went to on your own saying, I really want to see this?  No, not one.  Worst one I was ever dragged to was with my ex-mother-in-law, Judy. 
[01:46:30]  Judy is now dead, but she was here.  Which means Lon and Wally.  Lon and Wally, up in Boston.  But no, it was down here in New York.  They had come to visit.  Arnie Mog was here, who's dead also.  And my ex-wife, Jennifer.  And I got dragged to the Radio City Christmas show.  Oh!  Dude, dude, dude, dude! 
[01:47:00]  Oh, look.  Oh, look, they're dressed like wooden soldiers.  And they fall in a line.  Oh!  Oh, look at that.  Now they're doing the kick line.  Here it is!  The big kick line!  You had to sit through a can-can?  Dude, it was the...  And then the live nativity with all the animals they bring out.  Look, a camel's on stage!  There's a camel on the stage!  If you go to that show, you should be forced to have something in your can-can.  And then they're saying all the Christmas songs and the friggin'...  I sat there. 
[01:47:30]  I was...  It was torture.  It was torture to sit there.  Oh, God.  The place is gigantic.  I'm in the middle somewhere.  I didn't even care that I couldn't see, but I couldn't see, you know?  It was...  It's just another thing I was dragged to.  I've been dragged to everything.  I won't do it.  I won't do it no more.  My girl...  We had a relationship crisis, because I won't go see Wicked with her.  I saw Wicked.  And she keeps explaining to me...  You saw Wicked?  I've seen every God-effing show on Broadway.  It's the Wizard of Oz, but it's from the evil witch's point of view. 
[01:48:00]  She...  Shut up!  Let me ruin the ending.  She's friends with the Good Witch, and they planned the whole thing so the Wicked Witch  could run off with the...  I'll see the movie!  Interesting rated R, and it better not be PG-13, Wicked.  It better be rated R.  It's really...  The Bad Witch ends up being really the Good Witch.  It was all a trick.  Yeah, yeah.  It was a trick.  The monkeys were really...  No one died.  No one died.  There was no Wicked Witch.  The Wicked Witch was good.  The Wicked Witch was good. 
[01:48:30]  What the...  I won't know!  But it's called Wicked.  No.  See?  Tricked you.  Ah!  Just like I was tricked into going.  There's a play.  Wicked.  Wicked.  It just...  That's every girl in the audience.  And you went to see Wicked.  I saw Wicked.  Oh.  And the Philly crew and the Long Island crew got together to go to Wicked.  It wasn't even in the thought process to ask us guys.  It was...  No, you're just going.  It was for the girls.  You're going!  I've been to so many.  And like you said, yeah, every one of them I've been dragged to. 
[01:49:00]  Is that going to happen again with me?  Nope.  I learned.  Has it been one?  I learned.  Tell the truth.  Has it been one you were close to liking, but you just...  Your man is one that you fully like it?  I liked Young Frankenstein.  I really did.  I saw it because they were advertisers, and I definitely liked it.  I saw...  I saw The Wedding Singer with Stephen Lynch, and I liked that, too, because it's...  Oh, it's just because Stephen was in it.  I never would have seen that if Stephen Lynch wasn't in it.  Oh, absolutely not.  You're right.  I wouldn't have cared.  You're right.  I have to be biased. 
[01:49:30]  Did you enjoy it?  I'm biased because I like Stephen, and Stephen did a good job in it, but the play itself is...  Let's take Stephen out of the equation.  Sucked.  Okay.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I would never see that guard.  I saw Rocky Horror.  Rocky Horror with...  What's his name from Skid Row?  Tim Curry.  Was in it?  No, that's the one.  Sebastian Bach.  Oh, he was in the other one.  Yeah, he was in that, too.  Jekyll and Hyde.  Jekyll and Hyde.  I was dragged to that one back in the day.  Sebastian Bach's got a great voice, so to hear him sing was cool, but I don't want  to sit for that. 
[01:50:00]  I went to Cats like three times with three different bitches.  Girl way.  Enough.  Just broad, broad way.  Cats clothes.  Let me tell you this white trash friggin' Long Island piece of crap weekend I had years  ago.  It was me and the ex-wife, and we were going to the big city.  We were leaving the constraints of the island and going to the big city to go see Cats.  We're going to Broadway. 
[01:50:30]  And people on Broadway never considered that a Broadway show.  It made umpteen billion dollars.  It lasted for years and years because every Asian tourist and businessman packed that audience  for years.  Cats.  And then it just petered out and it became this nostalgic thing.  It was like some heavy metal kind of thing for the 80s.  What was the big song from Cats?  There was a couple of them, but there was the... 
[01:51:00]  It didn't make sense.  The whole thing didn't make sense.  And one thing I love.  Here's what I love.  Everybody's catty.  When you're sitting in the audience and the play comes out and interacts with you.  Ooh, do I love that attention.  When you get...  The cat doodles right on your lap row and the cat comes out and starts pawing at you.  I want to kick him.  Sprays on your seat.  Oh, jeez. 
[01:51:30]  Is that high?  Dude, I was at a show and they wanted me to do the audience participation.  I got it, I got it.  Tweed-a-doo-doo.  Tweedly-doo  Tweedly-tweedly-doo 
[01:52:00]  Tweedly-tweedly-doo  Now the guy talks  Oh, God  So, my white trash weekend  consisted of, like, I'm taking the wife out  We're going to see cats on Broadway  She borrows a fur coat  to make it look like  where, you know  Rolling in the dough  Yeah, what did Alice tell Ralph  when they were looking for a maid?  Yeah, we're big shots  You know, your scene 
[01:52:30]  Your past life was a scene  from Silence of the Lambs  You know, Anthony  with your cheap shoes  and your good bag  You're just one generation  That's why no one should be mad  at what Anthony's  Your borrowed fur coat  and your cheap shoes  That's why no one should be mad  at what Anthony's doing  with his life right now  because he's lived a horrific  horrific life in the past  I put on some horrid  ill-fitting suit 
[01:53:00]  that I had had since, like, my communion  I think  with, I believe, a Bugs Bunny tie  Dude, it was awful  I rented a limo  and we were going into the city  Hey, dinner first  at the Russian Tea Room  was part of the package  Wow, you got it  And it's a package deal  so you don't go in  and order something  they just give you  It's like, oh, here come  the schlep trash from Long Island  We give them, you know, this food  Deviled eggs  Yeah  Just horrid stuff 
[01:53:30]  Chicken bone marrow  and rice  Yeah  That's what it was  Just like this garbage  Don't forget the beets  Just beets, chicken bone marrow  and a slice of cheesecake  Yes  With fake cherries on top  And then they usher you out  because you're going to be late  for the show, you know  So back into the limo  and then we pull in front  of the Winter Garden Theater  and I'm like  I'm thinking  Alright  I'm getting out of a limo  in front of the Winter Garden  There's people going to think 
[01:54:00]  I'm somebody  No, they're not  You're just another  Long Island douche  So I just get out  and we go in  and see this god-awful play  and think  we're high rollers  I thought like  that night was like  Wait a minute  but you were into this though  You were into this night  Yeah, for me  that was my high roll  I told my family  it's like  Hey, that's what we're doing  He didn't know any better  Taking a limo into the city  to go see cats 
[01:54:30]  Borrowing the fur coat though  She borrowed a fur coat  and I was just like  in this bed  The suit was awful  Didn't fit me  It was horrid  Someone is asking  about Cirque du Soleil  Well, now  that's not really  considered Broadway  No, that's different  I've seen a couple  of those in Vegas  Those things are  effing amazing  Yeah, they're doing  something  They're amazing  Yeah, they bend up  Yeah, yeah  That's different  It's not some silly  Some Chinese girl  is spinning plates  on her face  I mean, that's entertainment 
[01:55:00]  Where would you place  a blue man group  in that  I saw a blue man group  So did I  Yuck  What's the hype  With the pipes  It was pipes  So they're playing PVC  How much longer?  All right, we get it  You got a blue face  and you're tapping  on some PVC  Oh, look  They're rolling out  toilet paper  Here it goes  And it falls  from the ceiling  Oh, the big finale  You go, how are they  gonna pull  After the first 
[01:55:30]  five minutes  you go, how are they  gonna pull  You're curious  to know how they  gonna pull it off  Yeah  Pull off this thing  for another hour  and ten minutes  You know how they do it?  The first song  is about hypnotizing  and then you're  you're hypnotizing  the audience  This is supposed  to just hypnotize you  He's playing  a PVC pipe  He's playing plumbing  that slides in  and out of each other  Right  So it makes a different  tone when he hits  on it  And I'm sitting there 
[01:56:00]  going, okay  For the first two seconds  you're kind of like  wow, that's cool  He's playing PVC  And then again  you're just sitting  going, how long  is this gonna go on?  How long?  How about the trash can  lids, people  Oh, Stomp  or, no, the other one  Was it Stomp?  Yeah  Yeah, look  they're playing  trash cans and spackle buckets  I can see this  in Times Square  I can see this  while I'm waiting  I can see this  while I'm waiting  for the C train  Why do I have to pay  $100?  No interest  I'm sorry  Nothing, right?  These people  would probably see this 
[01:56:30]  though  They're probably angry  Yeah  Because it's like  I guess if somebody  like, I don't  somebody who didn't  see The Godfather  and goes, I don't get it  You just go, what are you?  What's wrong with you?  Crazy?  How many times  have you just said  can we eat now?  Yeah, can we go?  Just, it's over now  Can we go eat?  I love it  Yeah  Intermission  I'm like, alright  we're at the halfway point  Jesus  I leave every intermission  Do you?  That I've ever been to  I'm out  I drink  I get up  Get that $20  friggin' shot  of a drink  Bastard 
[01:57:00]  I can't even tell you  what me and my girl  did at Avenue Q  next to these two  white people  Uh oh  up, just  just had to dress up  a little  and just  reach behind  and we  she just  sat there  for the whole  for about  a good 10 minutes  of Avenue Q  You were driving  up Avenue V  You were having  your own puppet show  Dirty puppet  Patrice  Alright, we gotta 
[01:57:30]  take a break  Uh  Ann Curry  doing stand up  and we'll take  a peek at that  Thanks for  the heads up  Chris  Opie and Anthony  Patrice, what are you  promoting today?  Dallas  Oh yeah, Addison Improv  Dallas people  will go check you  out this weekend  There you go  Opie and Anthony  we'll finish next  Alright, where are we?  Having a good time  with Patrice O'Neal  I know that much  It's Opie and Anthony  and Bobby in Boston  listening on BCN 
[01:58:00]  he has something  What's up Bobby?  What's going on guys?  What are you up there?  Oh, we're just  hanging out  Alright, well  you guys are talking  about Broadway shows  I'm from New York  I live in Boston  I'm not a Broadway show  but what do you  think about fireworks?  Fireworks are the  dumbest thing in the world  You get a bunch of people  in a cramped area  staring at the sky  oohing and aahing  at the sky lighting up  the same pattern  every year  and then they put  it to music  and everyone's like  enthralled by it  It's ridiculous  Yeah, I hate fireworks 
[01:58:30]  Boring  Yeah  It's kind of fun  if you watch  a fireworks display  with little ones  because then you get  into it because  they're like excited  but if you're just  sitting there by yourself  you would never look  at a fireworks display  No  The only fireworks displays  that are cool  is when one of your  buddies buys a bunch  of illegals  Oh yeah  and then they go  on the street  in front of the house  and you're lighting them  When you light them  Because that's an element  of dangers there  you know  this loud stuff 
[01:59:00]  You're so right  because when you light them  then it's like  look what I did  Look, that's me  I did that  Nothing worse  than the Petruzzuli brothers  Petrus  and their dumb boats  with their giant gallon  of their beach  Their BJ wholesale gallon  drums of fireworks  Mortars  Nothing out there  as big as your head  And the last  and the 1712 overture  or whatever it is  Yeah, yeah  For the big finale  Yeah  Yippee  1812, 1712  Whatever  It's all the same  It's one of those overtures  for me  I'd rather listen 
[01:59:30]  to the 112 overture  before it was problems  How good are fireworks  if during the display  you say  three or four different times  Oh, I think this is the finale  Oh, is this the finale?  Da-da-da-da-da-da  Dun-dun-dun-dun  That's when you know  it's a great way to get over  But you miscue it every time  like, oh no  this is the finale  It's obvious  Yeah  Oh, wow  Oh no, here it is  This is the finale  This is the big finale  No?  You start scratching your head  Well, obviously  this has to be 
[02:00:00]  Yes, Disney's fireworks  at Epcot Center  That's pretty good  Are they at?  Oh, God  They got big flaming torches  What makes them so good?  Well, they're  One shape like Mickey Mouse  You're at the happiest place  on earth  Goofy  So, you know  you're in a good mood anyway  They got a firework  that looks like  Hannah Montana  Yeah  Where are we?  And it smells like  cinnamon and vanilla  Where are we at  with circuses?  I hate  Yeah, I'm with you  The circus  You know what?  I went to the circus  once when I was  a little, little lad 
[02:00:30]  My dad took me  and my brother and sister  and we were sitting  so far back  in Madison Square Garden  I couldn't see anything  But they got the three rings  for everybody  Dude, no  Something for everybody  There would have had to have been  a ring on the ceiling  Like our backs  were to the wall  up in the garden  That's how far up we were  Sounds like dad  drank the circus ticket money  Yeah, drank the circus ticket money  Absolutely  Or he got a freebie  from somebody  whatever  in exchange for stolen goods  Sure  So he buys me this thing 
[02:01:00]  like the people  that walk around the stands  selling garbage and junk  and I wanted  one of these lights  It was like a little flashlight  with a red light on it  on a chain  Is this going to end  with you crying again?  Well  Okay  Why does every dad story  have to end with you crying?  I didn't want to blow up your spot  but it's just something I've noticed  So  I was bitching and complaining  that I want  Get the light  Get me the light 
[02:01:30]  So he was like  Alright  He buys this thing  It's on a little key chain thing  and it's a red light  and when you spin it  it looks like a continuous red circle  You know how that works  You didn't get the good one?  The one that rolled up the stick  and rolled down  and then rolled back  Oh that little roly-poly thingy thing  No  I know what Dan's talking about  It's almost like on a key chain  and you just kind of spin it around  Yeah, you just spin it  It whistles a little bit  It was  No, it didn't even whistle  This was back before  whistling was incorporated  This thing probably had vacuum tubes in it  You went before there was even animal cruelty 
[02:02:00]  Yeah, yeah  Where they actually  you could see them beat the monkeys  with a  Before there was  rules  just choking the lions  burning the elephants with sticks  with hot  hot  hot  hot  hot  hot  hot  hot  hot  hot  hot  hot  hot  hot  hot  hot  hot  hot  hot  hot  hot  hot  hot  hot  hot  hot  hot  hot  hot  hot  hot  hot  hot  hot 
[02:02:30]  hot  hot  hot  hot  hot  hot  hot  hot  hot  hot  hot  hot  hot  hot  hot  hot  hot  hot  hot  hot  hot  hot  hot  hot  hot  hot  hot  hot  Another thing I got was this little electric battery-powered fan. 
[02:03:00]  One of those things, the blades would fold down, but then when you turned it on, it would go,  and like blow a little cool air on your face.  Yeah, sure.  As a kid, you know, it's cool, anything with a propeller that moves.  So my father had a big 55-gallon drum with dirty oil water in it from where he tested his outboard motor,  and I put the little blade in there just a little bit to see it.  It's like, oh, I'm going to make a propeller motor thing.  It slips out of my hand, goes into the bottom of this murky oil water. 
[02:03:30]  Of course, I just burst out crying.  That was the biggest crybaby.  I was just a crybaby.  I constantly was crying, and my father was constantly telling me to stop crying.  The crying is not, it's that you remember.  Like, I only have maybe two traumatic things that my mother might have did to me that I'd look back and go, wow.  Well, these weren't even traumatic.  This was just me.  This was just life experiences.  You remember these?  Oh, I remember stuff from when I was like three.  Because he's still crying.  He's just crying on the inside.  Crying on the inside, yeah.  Hey, Steven, that's from Bayshore.  It's amazing Anthony didn't die from dehydration as a kid. 
[02:04:00]  Yes.  I keep drinking water, Anthony.  Yeah.  I keep crying it out.  I was a salty little lad.  My cheeks were always salty with tears.  I remember these little crying incidents.  I'd cry, and I was scared, crapless at everything.  My mother left me, my brother and sister, in a car once, you know, when she ran in.  This was back in the day where you'd roll the window down a little bit, leave your kids in the car, who cares?  And I was petrified.  And I'm just looking around, and this guy walks up to the window and goes, hey, how you doing?  And I screamed and cowered on the other side of the car. 
[02:04:30]  He was worse than the children in Jurassic Park.  Oh, God, that is it.  It might as well have been a T-Rex with his pupil looking in on me.  I was screaming, and it turned out the guy was like one of my mother's friends just coming out to say hi to us.  And he's like, holy jeez, your kid's a psychopath.  When did you make the man change?  I don't think I ever did.  Really?  No.  At some point, I just gave it up.  I gave up on Karen. 
[02:05:00]  What was the answer then where you said you balled up your fist and you were just like, no more crying there?  I gave up on Karen.  Probably when he discovered girls.  Yeah.  Then it's like, why am I crying over this crap?  Yeah, there's much more important things.  Putting this in that.  That was pretty much it.  That will stop all tears.  Yeah.  You know, good point.  That is pretty much when I discovered I liked girls.  Yeah, then you're like, give some crap about my little dumb propeller thing in the bottom of the 50s.  Yeah, I was always like, bleh.  I had model, little model dinosaurs and microscopes and telescopes. 
[02:05:30]  I was like a geeky little crybaby kid.  And then there was this hot girl, Leanne, Leanne Marinelli, lived across the street and she was always coming over.  And like, I think I could have kind of, you know, at least, you know, done kid sex with her where you just kind of kiss.  Sure.  You know, things like that.  Sex for kids.  Well, show the hiney, that was all in.  Show the hiney.  That was all in as a kid.  Something like that.  Yeah.  You give a little kiss or something like that.  I was just too much of a douche to even know that she really liked me.  You know, when I moved out to California, when I was 12 or something and I go out to California and she writes me a letter with tears on it. 
[02:06:00]  It was like the ink was like smudged with tears.  And she puts a little hour.  She goes, this is one of my tears.  I can't believe you left.  I love you so much.  And I just was like, hey, you want to go out and play?  You want to go mini golf?  You want to go like I was with her all the time?  That was pretty touching yourself too.  Dude, yeah.  You couldn't even take care of your business where you just go, wow, she liked me?  Let me crank one out to the back.  That was crazy.  It was just, yeah. 
[02:06:30]  Nice.  And then I guess my brother came out to California for a little while, turned me on to weed.  And then girls.  So, you know, buzz.  No more crying, Fran.  And the crying stopped.  No more crying.  Yeah.  It left its damage, but no more crying.  Well, I remember it all.  I remember that plate of spaghetti smashing against the wall and my father getting up from the table and yelling at my mother.  I would just cry.  I would cry every time they argued.  And they argued a lot.  Boo, stop.  I'd run between them. 
[02:07:00]  No.  Like I'm going to stop them from getting their imminent divorce by running and crying.  What a dummy.  I don't remember a lot of stuff growing up.  I blocked it all out.  That was back when everyone was tough.  No.  That was back when women were tough.  That was back.  My mother took a beating sometimes.  And it just seemed like, you know, I never saw a cop.  No.  No one called the cops on that crap.  My mother would smash me in the face just with hard things.  And we'd listen to each other.  All my friends would listen out the window. 
[02:07:30]  I had other friends that got beatings that day.  And we would hear them crying.  And it was just, you just, it was a tougher time.  You just enjoy punishment.  When you went to school, no one asked, how'd you get that?  It was just, you know.  You know what I mean?  Now if you go to school with a bruise or something broken, they have to ask you all sorts of questions.  Back in the day, it was part of growing up.  There were 800 numbers.  I lived in an apartment building in Central Islip. 
[02:08:00]  And all you heard every night were arguments going on, depending on what wall you stood near.  Like everyone was miserable and arguing.  But you never saw a cop pull up to that place.  And you heard like things banging around.  The whole complex was yelling at each other.  There were miserable married people living with each other people.  And it just, that's what you lived through.  Upstairs, you're hearing just banging around, people throwing crap, yelling. 
[02:08:30]  It's great.  Yeah, sure.  No such word as domestic abuse.  No, that wasn't it.  It was just called being married.  I think it's healthier that way.  Oh, yeah?  Instead of going to therapy and all that crap.  Well, now they just call the cops instantly.  Like someone hears something, they call the cops.  We got to do a speed round.  Speed round.  The time is...  Time is short.  Yes.  We got Terry Clifford's isolated audio from yesterday.  Remember about an hour ago we did this?  We're doing it with somebody else.  Is that okay?  Is that good enough?  Sure. 
[02:09:00]  We're featuring The Hole as part of our Jocktober celebration.  Every show has a hole.  And then you isolate what The Hole is saying.  And then you realize, wow, they're getting away with murder.  Realize what they bring to the show.  Where was the one we just did?  Yeah, let me do this one first.  Just in case the people weren't listening.  We were featuring a show out of Cleveland this morning.  This Terry Moore or what?  Terry Moore.  And then we're like, wow, she's not really adding much to the show.  So let's isolate exactly what she's doing.  And this is what we came up with. 
[02:09:30]  I love that.  Oh, I love that.  Can you set it lower than 80?  They really are.  She looks great.  She looks...  I have 32 teeth.  I have 32 teeth.  No.  And then they still have a blood sucking thing.  No.  How about blood?  No.  So it's not even...  Ew.  There's nothing to do with blood.  I was wrong and I got nothing.  And I got to tell you, we didn't mess with the tape whatsoever.  That's just how it was.  Yeah, that's it.  We just said, Sam, every time she talks, isolate it and put it into a little montage. 
[02:10:00]  Now, yesterday we were featuring WB's Terry Clifford out of Rochester, New York.  Boy, did we give her a good hammering yesterday.  We sure did.  And now Sam took her audio and isolated it from the audio we played yesterday.  And this is what you get from Terry Clifford.  Well, good morning, Steve Hausman.  No.  Was that...  Oh, you're so rude.  Anyway.  No.  All right.  That's enough.  No.  No.  Oh, my gosh. 
[02:10:30]  Good for you.  Yeah, but it's what's inside that counts with her.  Do you want to hear about it or don't you?  Wow.  It's like that's the bit that we do.  Yeah.  Like, our bit isn't funny anymore.  It's just true.  It's just what it is.  And no editing, by the way.  No.  No.  That's absolutely...  Every word she said.  Patrice, because we're not going to have you tomorrow, unfortunately.  Your slave thing.  What? 
[02:11:00]  I want you to talk about the slave thing.  You came to a realization about slavery a little bit.  A realization about slavery that I rejected my entire life.  Right.  Anytime you talk to a white person about slavery and they would go, well, you helped to...  You know, black people sell themselves.  Right, yeah.  You helped.  Yeah.  Like, why are you giving me a problem?  Your own people sold you to save slavery.  Exactly.  That's the white man's way of looking at it.  I was going to shut your face.  Right.  And I wouldn't accept it.  But I'm a logical guy.  But I finally accepted it.  And one of my friends, black dude, just goes... 
[02:11:30]  He just looked at me and goes, what do you think?  What do you think?  White people just went into the jungle and hunted black people?  They were at the pier.  Waiting.  Waiting to be picked up on a ship.  And so it destroyed Roots for me.  Because Roots' whole thing was, they went into the woods and black people just scattered.  Yeah.  They went into the jungles of Africa and black people went, oh, here comes white people.  Uh-oh.  And they all ran around and just caught them with little hooks.  Just nets and stuff.  And I'm going, wait a minute. 
[02:12:00]  There's no way they went into the jungle and hunted black people in Africa.  A white guy is going to go into the jungle of Africa where the black guys have been just  living, know everything about it, know how to hunt, know how to...  And they're going to just, hey, excuse me.  Yeah, we'll let you do this.  I did not accept it.  Like, but the way he just said it, like, what do you think?  They went into the jungle and just scooped them up like squirrels?  Some big fat chief with a lot of jewelry around them was like, ha, ha, ha, at the dock.  Just selling them all.  Right.  You know? 
[02:12:30]  That's what I'm saying.  And then I went, oh my God.  Yeah.  We sold each other.  Yeah.  You're pretty much...  Like, you know, I still don't like y'all, but it's just like, wow.  We did sell each other.  At least you'll admit you had a hand in it.  Yeah.  A little bit of a hand in it.  Yeah.  Yep.  Yep.  Got him on the boat.  It certainly wasn't...  That's pretty much it.  What do you think the white guy was doing on the pier just waiting, looking at his nails?  Looking at his pocket watch.  Just coming right in.  It wasn't like the music.  He had a musket and it was like, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do. 
[02:13:00]  I'm...  Be very, very quiet.  Very quiet.  I'm hunting.  It was a horrible realization.  It was like, wow.  God damn.  We really dogged each other.  We just were sold.  Yeah.  And then we were talking about Lincoln also.  Like, Lincoln's motives.  Like, I don't...  That's another thing I got to go and study.  I'll probably get mad.  A lot of this stuff.  The Emancipation Proclamation. 
[02:13:30]  You think he was that good of a guy or he was doing it for some other power things?  No.  This was completely to cripple the South.  The South depended on their slaves to fuel their war machine during the Civil War.  Lincoln, wanting to beat the South, said, well, if we free the slaves, these guys are screwed.  They're going to need people to work.  Why is that never pointed out?  It's pointed out a lot.  Not really.  I mean, generally, people think, you know, Lincoln is one of the greatest guys to ever 
[02:14:00]  live.  It's no noble frigging good guy thing that Lincoln did.  He was like, hey, this is what we got to do.  It's just like if somebody goes, you know, we did a study and found out that Jesus, it  was just a puddle that he walked on.  Yeah.  And it just messes up every...  It's like, oh, it wasn't a miracle?  Yeah.  It just wasn't, you know...  He wasn't walking on water.  It was like an inch deeper.  It's just like if you blow up somebody's idea, like Lincoln, people want to believe that Lincoln  freed somebody, but he did, but, you know, it wasn't noble. 
[02:14:30]  It wasn't like, I believe the black man should be free.  And no, it's pretty much, well, the South, we got kicked their ass.  They sure do like their slaves.  Let's let them all go.  It's just free.  That's it.  Free the pigeons.  Yeah.  It's like when Peter goes in and just lets a bunch of, like, mink out of the cages.  You know?  That's pretty much what it was.  Just a bunch of white people with black blood on them.  He just threw right in front, and we just ran and go. 
[02:15:00]  Go free.  You're free now.  What?  Imagine that.  What am I supposed to do?  Hey, listen, so where's the apartments?  Where do we go?  We're the landlords.  Don't care.  Don't care, but you're free.  Oh, God.  How do we not just.  Good luck to you.  Go west.  How do we not blow up things?  Go west, young man.  How do I look at you right now?  Yeah.  I'm looking at you two right now.  You think it's easy for us?  But it's based on something else.  They went to some of the major northern cities. 
[02:15:30]  And put a long Wyatt Earp gun in this, man.  A Wyatt Earp.  Ah, that's our music.  Ah, yeah.  We got to get out of here and go to our filthy dirty mouth segment of the show.  I can swear now.  I feel like swearing.  Improv Addison for everybody in the Dallas area.  That's where you're going to see Patrice O'Neill.  This weekend.  Man, I mean, Patrice just blowing up with the comedy.  Always good, but now you seem to have made it to another level.  The next plateau.  Oh, I can't wait. 
[02:16:00]  People rave about what you've been doing on that stage lately.  I'm going to do a special where I'm going to travel to three different countries.  Really?  Yeah.  Why?  I'm just, no.  No, I'm really not.  No?  That's what Chris Rock did.  That's kind of a good concept, though.  Chris Rock did that.  South America, South Africa, England, and America.  You should do the same set in three different, very different places and see how it's perceived.  I wasn't, well, I'll talk about this when we go over there, but I was very impressed with  the new Chris Rock thing. 
[02:16:30]  Well, we'll talk about it.  Yes, we will.  You weren't impressed?  Weren't impressed.  All right.  Weren't impressed.  Really?  Yeah.  That's shocking.  Yeah.  That's a good tease, man.  All right.  See you.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  He's leaving the show. 
[02:17:00]  Ah, the show continues.  Patrice O'Neill in studio.  Hello.  Hi, Opie.  What's that problem?  A little feedback-y.  Getting a little feedback-y.  Oh.  Who was it?  You might have to put your headphones on or turn down your volume.  No.  Maybe.  That shouldn't be a prompt.  How's that?  I don't know. 
[02:17:30]  We'll soon find out.  Hi, Greg.  Hi, Patrice.  Patrick.  Hi, Anthony.  Hi.  Hi, Patrick.  So, why didn't you like the Chris Rock special?  Well, I just thought, like, he's kind of meh.  All right.  That first special he had, what was the name of that first one?  Bring the Pain.  Bring the Pain. 
[02:18:00]  Bring the Pain, right.  That was the one that, like, really launched him.  He's hysterical.  You know, he's talking about the community.  Some of the problems in the community.  I thought it was pretty good.  Very good.  That put him on the map.  That put him on the map.  Remember when that came out, people were like, wow, that black guy from SNL is actually funny.  Yeah, it was.  Right?  It's like a mirror.  Chris Rock's been famous to black people for a long time.  I understand that.  Yeah, it was very much like the Eddie Murphy Delirious, though, where, you know, he came 
[02:18:30]  out and it was just giant.  Everyone had to see it.  You could watch it a few times and it was funny, you know?  This latest one where he does the show from, what, three countries or some crap?  What's he doing?  Three countries.  It's like he's kind of a parody of himself now.  So, he's kind of turned into, like, his delivery doesn't seem as sincere as it used to. 
[02:19:00]  Like that, when you watched years ago, you're like, wow, yeah, okay, he's doing his Chris  Rock delivery.  You know, he'll repeat a line over and over again and it's funny because it really hits  the point home.  It didn't seem funny anymore.  Like, it seemed contrived and kind of phony.  And his material just wasn't as strong.  Wasn't he talking about the presidency and the election?  Yeah, you know, he had that.  He had a few good things.  But it was like, eh, for the most part, you know, I just wasn't, I didn't find it very 
[02:19:30]  funny.  We were talking on the way over.  And I was really psyched to see it, you know?  He was really promoting the hell out of it as far as his new big, you know, special.  And we were discussing on the way over, like, why is it that most comedians have one big  hit, one big set, like Eddie Murphy, Delirious, Richard Pryor.  I mean, he had more than one.  But in general, these guys have one huge, holy shit, you got to listen to this CD. 
[02:20:00]  Yeah.  Go old school back in the day.  And then that same comedian never gets that point ever again.  I mean, he has a good career.  Oh, yeah, great career.  Has very good sets, but not that one, they have that one big monster hit and then never  come close again.  The difficulty with comedy is the same with the difficulty in music, I think.  Or a song, not comedy.  A song, you go, oh, you keep hearing the same song, which is the same rhythm or whatever,  you know, whatever famous song has a great rhythm to it. 
[02:20:30]  Yeah.  I think comedians have to change their rhythm.  It's a, once people figure you out.  Right, right.  And they can figure out your rhythm.  You ever go to see a comic and you laugh, but at the end of the day, you go, what did  I just laugh at?  Because you're not laughing at what they're saying.  You're laughing.  They get into a fantastic rhythm and you just start to know when you're supposed to laugh 
[02:21:00]  and it's just an enjoyable thing.  And that's why, I mean, you know, sometimes, I learned this early, but you have to bomb sometimes  to be able to change your rhythm.  Like, I mean, I love, like, people are fans of mine.  They'll come back to see me because they'll know I'll just be different.  Even if I have maybe the same joke here and there, it just, it won't be something they  go, I can, I heard this song already.  I heard this rhythm already. 
[02:21:30]  So I'll say something and then, you know, people go, oh, that, oh, wait, or I'll talk  for a long time without the motherfuckers laughing.  Like, there's no rhythm to it.  And I think once you get it and you don't change what you do, that's when people attack  you as we get what you do.  You do this.  You go blah, blah, blah, booga, booga, booga.  Right, right.  Everything.  Yeah.  And they figured you out.  I mean, that's what they started doing today.  I just saw a family guy did a, they, and, and they, they modulize it as this is what 
[02:22:00]  he does.  And once they can do that, oh, this is what you do is you go, this family guy goes, well,  this Dane Cook character, or they actually call it Dane Cook.  And you go, and he went, I'm going to talk about something, and then I'm going to wave  my hands around, and I'm going to spin in a circle.  And then they had two people in the audience that was watching the show going, I think 
[02:22:30]  this is supposed to be fun.  Like, it was just, it was a real attack.  It was actually, it was this past Sunday's family guy, what the guy says in the crowd,  he's clapping for Dane, he goes, he goes, he's on the internet, and I'm in college.  And I'm watching it, because I'm fucking like, I'm fucking, I know Dane.  So it's difficult to be like, if I didn't know him, I'd be like, oh, that's funny shit.  But I'm like, ah, that's just, just to, just to, just marginalize your shit and make somebody 
[02:23:00]  else see your holes.  Is that just a jealousy thing?  Because I, of course it is.  I've seen Dane in Boston and the Garden twice.  And I, I, I'm not going to be one of these guys.  I liked it a lot.  Of course it's jealousy, man.  And I was really into it.  He's selling out Madison Square Garden.  It's so easy to go, ah, Dane, how did he get to where he is?  But I'm telling you, he, we remember seeing him back at the old comedy connection when  we were up in Boston.  He was funny then, he's funny today. 
[02:23:30]  But is it a jealousy thing to just knock him down at this point?  The tough thing, why, why I don't, why he doesn't bother me?  And I'll mention him all the time, because people just want to goat you when they're  going, fuck him.  But dude, he's a, he's righteous in terms of what he does.  And it doesn't bother me because I think we're just going, we'll go down a different  road.  But I think a lot of, a lot of young white boys are bothered by his, his, uh, success.  Yeah.  Here it is.  You found it.  This is from, uh, the MTV movie awards hosted by Dane Cook. 
[02:24:00]  Hey everybody.  What's up?  Dane Cook here in the house at the MTV movie awards.  What's up?  What's up?  Hey, you know what I hate?  When you eat an ice cream cone and it's all like cold and you're like, and you're like,  why didn't you warn me that's so cold?  And he's like, it's ice cream, dude.  And you're like, oh man, but chicks don't do that because they use a spoon.  Ah, what's up?  Su-fi.  Boom.  Myspace.  Is he saying something funny?  I don't know, but he's moving around a lot.  So I guess. 
[02:24:30]  Ha ha.  He was on the internet and I'm in college.  Ha ha.  Holy shit.  Somebody don't like Dane Cook.  Ooh, that's, ooh, that's bad.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Wow.  Yow.  What the fuck?  Ooh, that made me hot.  That like, that like made my face hot.  Ha ha ha.  Huh?  There's a, man, man TV a while ago.  I think it was about a year, year and a half ago.  They did a pretty good one.  The guy did a pretty good imitation for fucking Dane, man.  We could pop that one on too. 
[02:25:00]  Hang on.  Full disclosure though.  I think the guy's very funny.  Uh, yeah, this is that guy.  He did a pretty good imitation.  This is like the one, this is like the one mad TV thing that really makes me laugh.  Oh, God.  You gotta, you gotta see Bobby.  Dane is a huge target though.  It's, it's just amazing.  But, but it's not bad enough where people are like, yeah.  It's like internet.  Oh, Jesus.  Now it's gonna buffer.  Ah, you motherfucker.  All right.  Uh, by the way.  Honey man, Dane Cook.  Okay.  Why do they call me? 
[02:25:30]  You fucking buffering piece of shit.  Can we get it in the back office?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  All right.  Get it, get it from the back office.  And, uh, I just want to go to Paul in Brooklyn.  Uh, the Chris Rock thing.  Now, Anthony, I saw, um, Chris Rock.  It has to be the same stuff he did for the special.  I was laughing pretty hard when I went and saw him.  So I'm trying to figure out why it wasn't that good.  Paul might have the answer and you might want to.  Ah.  Oh.  What do you got?  Uh-huh.  Hey guys, good morning.  Uh, I was wondering if, if maybe it's because he did it in the three cities and the way 
[02:26:00]  that it was edited, you can see that it was exactly the same in all three cities, maybe  because it didn't appear to be as spontaneous as other performances have been.  Yeah, what they did, it was, it was kind of gimmicky in that they, um, they, they like  had him do the, the, the same performance in almost the same steps.  He was taking like the same places on the stage, I guess, and, and the same movements  and then they would edit it.  So he's in one country and then halfway through the joke, they'll cut and he's in another country. 
[02:26:30]  It's like, is the background's a little different or something?  You just know it's different and it fucks up the rhythm of it.  It was distracting.  And everybody in comedy, I'm talking, people who even enjoy comedy, they're always trying  to figure out what you do and say, all you do is this.  That's, that's people's dream.  Because I was sitting there watching and I was like, you know, it, it, it took me out 
[02:27:00]  of, it took me out of the performance, you know?  So, oh, Anthony, before I go, uh, go Obama, buddy.  Peace.  Go Obama.  Go Obama.  I mean, I watched it, I mean, he said, I mean, look, there was the thing he goes, look,  I mean, it's the commentary of it.  And there's some, there's some stuff in it, uh, that it's, it's, it's really some, he  knows how to deliver it.  So he gets a laugh, but the, the, the subject matter is, is hardcore, which is like, I live  in a rich community and if only black people in the community are, uh, me, Jay Z, Mary 
[02:27:30]  J. Blige and, um, shit, I forgot the last one, but, oh, was it Oprah?  Anyway, he goes, look, oh, Eddie Murphy.  Yeah.  So he goes, Eddie Murphy, greatest comic of all time.  Uh, Jay Z, greatest hip hop artist all time.  Mary J. Blige, greatest R&B.  And then me, and then he goes, my neighbor is a dentist, a white dentist, just a regular  white dentist, never an all time white dentist.  So that's a, that, that commentary, man, it's a lot of deep shit on it, but it's, it's because 
[02:28:00]  he's, he's known how to craft, he's knows how to craft anything into funny.  That's the, that's the tough thing right now about Chris.  There's no, there's no danger right now because he knows how to make anything funny.  And, and if people are listening to him and they, there's never a time that, that he, that  he's going to do something where you go, wow, shit.  I mean, George Carlin, dude, and I'm not comparing the two. 
[02:28:30]  I watch George Carlin and I, and I go, I go, this motherfucker.  One time I'd swear to God, one of the most shocking things I've ever heard anybody say  on stage is he goes, what the fuck?  I don't know.  He goes, what the fuck is this shit about angels?  What about goblins?  Huh?  Like I go, holy, it, it unnerved me to hear somebody go, what the fuck is all this shit  about angels?  He doesn't believe in God. 
[02:29:00]  Yeah, obviously.  And he fucking says it.  And no matter how funny you try to be saying you don't believe in God, that's some hardcore  shit or fuck children.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Children and shit.  That is deeper than curmudgeon.  It's just.  He pulled it off.  Hey, uh, let this guy, Tom, it's my, my girl on MSNBC.  You like her Tom?  Go ahead.  Well, chocolate, a little chocolate. 
[02:29:30]  Hey,  the thing you just ran on Dane Cook, that, that, that spoof.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We're listening.  I mean, that is, that is like right on.  He's not funny.  Uh, I, you know,  I'm not funny.  Not funny.  Not funny.  Not funny.  Not funny.  You know, it's like he does that strut around the stage.  His arms are moving.  And it's like he's practicing to go up the stairs three or four at a time.  But it just doesn't work.  I, you know, it's one of those, you know, how does he have a career? 
[02:30:00]  I don't get it.  I listen to XM.  I've got the comedy stations.  They, they pop his.  But do you hear this guy?  Oh, this is, he.  And I'm not a comic, so there's no jealousy.  This guy is a.  All right.  Honestly, there's a lot of guys out there I don't find funny.  There's another guy on, uh, his feedback.  He thinks I'm saying Dane Cook's funny because I'm friends with him.  I'm not really friends with Dane Cook.  We're friends with Bob Kelly.  We're friends with Bob Kelly now.  So we've been able to kind of get to know him a little bit.  Through his lackey.  Right.  You know, but I'm not a friend.  I'm not friends with Dane Cook. 
[02:30:30]  YouTube.  Like.  It don't work.  You know, I mean, again, no jealousy.  He's able to see Dane Cook.  This guy's able to see Dane Cook.  Stop.  Every second of the day and fucking deconstruct him.  Yeah.  Deconstruct.  If you, if you did one thing, which is what Colin used to do and probably used to do before  YouTube where, or Bill Cosby himself, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  All you can do is watch Bill Cosby himself all day long and deconstruct that shit. 
[02:31:00]  But you're deconstructing greatness.  But on YouTube and you can, you can see fucking Dane doing something at fucking Marble, Marble  Heads Jokes Factory somewhere back in the day.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You can watch him before he had really.  I got some on YouTube of me and fucking, uh, I did my shit in.  Where was it then?  Shitty, uh.  Some horrible place. 
[02:31:30]  In Holland.  Holland.  Okay.  I mean, do you know if somebody watches me now and watch me, oh, you do, like you can  just deconstruct my shit if you're a cunt.  Well, yeah, yeah.  Because you've grown since then, obviously.  I mean, I'm a better comic.  You honed your craft.  I left this shit on you.  Some of this shit on YouTube.  But the stuff I get off immediately is self, arbitrary cell phone shit where I'm doing  a joke that I might do in another town.  It's like, I'm not fucking, I'm not, I have to build an hour. 
[02:32:00]  Right.  Yeah.  That's another thing.  When you're fucking famous, you can't not be funny.  All right.  Yeah.  Hey, uh, Tom, thank you.  You know what?  You don't think he's funny.  Others think, you know, I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna try to convince you that the guy's  a funny guy.  That's fine.  I mean, I, I think, you know, I gotta hang up on you.  You gotta know when to stop talking so we can have a conversation.  You know, there's...  And you see how fucking passionate he is about hatred?  Yeah.  Like, how he hates...  It's just not funny at all. 
[02:32:30]  That's, that's, that's your opinion.  It's so subjective.  And it's fine.  Yeah.  Like, I think, uh, George Carlin is brilliant.  I guarantee, give it two minutes, somebody will call and go, like, Carlin, he sucks.  But his audio, the, the, the way that they, it's hard to say Carlin sucks, because they  would have to go, all he does is...  All right, here we go.  Here we got, we got one.  He's bullshit, gotta be.  Space Trucker.  Yeah.  Go ahead, Space Trucker.  Well, uh, I love George Carlin. 
[02:33:00]  I'm not criticizing him.  I like Chris Rock.  But didn't Carlin, on your show, talk about how when he practices, it's, it's a set piece  that sometimes in a show, he's looking at an empty seat when he delivers a line?  What?  What?  I, I, I was, like, stunned for a second there.  It's like, I lost...  It's like he stunned me.  I lost you somewhere, Space Trucker.  Didn't Carlin? 
[02:33:30]  Yeah.  He was on your show.  Yeah, okay.  I heard this.  Yes, we heard that part.  But I don't understand what your point is, even if he did.  Let's say he's on stage and he stares at an empty seat.  Well, we were, we're saying that the problem with Chris Rock's new, uh, show is that it  seemed like such a set piece that goes from country to country, but he's in the same place  on the stage.  Right.  He, I don't see the criticism, because I love them both.  I, I, I...  Well, did you see the Chris Rock special?  I did not see it, so I don't have an opinion on it. 
[02:34:00]  I saw, I saw what I think is the material he used in the special, and I thought it was,  you know, pretty good.  I'm very confused about this caller.  All right, Space Trucker, thank you.  Very confused.  You lost us.  Oh, by the way.  Yeah.  I love you.  All right, no.  What?  All right, Space Trucker, he's usually good for one, to be honest with you, but, uh,  I'm a little confused with that.  Let's say hi to...  I don't think his point was, he didn't know what his point was.  Dave in Massachusetts.  Yeah, why not take the Ronnie B approach, and, uh, hey, take it as a compliment. 
[02:34:30]  You're so famous, they made funny on Family Guy.  Yeah, I would think that's a cool thing.  I felt that way when we did Tough Crowd, and I, and, uh, and Tough Crowd, they, I had  an act, they drew pictures of me, Colin, uh, I think Bobby, it was a couple of us, and  they drew pictures, and we were the second worst thing about comedy in the country, in  Mad Magazine.  Oh, I thought it was, I fucking took it from the source.  I love, I mean, if you take Family Guy, they lampoon, they, they fuck, look, if I was a 
[02:35:00]  star, a celebrity, I'm gonna tell you, man, they did something about Minnie Driver's head.  It was shockingly, like, I put myself in her, I just was like, that just, that's just  horrible, Minnie, there's no way she can, Minnie Driver, they said, the guy was, okay, back  up, please.  Okay, back up, they were setting up the, the, the shot.  Yeah.  All right, back up, back up again.  All right.  Oh, Jesus, yeah.  All right, and action.  Minnie Driver's head comes out, and he, and it still didn't fill up the whole thing. 
[02:35:30]  And she, they go, all right, cut, I thought we pulled back far, I mean, Family Guy is  brutal, so for, for you to get teased on there is a different fucking animal.  We got the mad TV about Dane Cook, here, here it is.  Later tonight, internet funny man, Dane Cook.  Why do they call bananas, bananas?  Should they be called funanas, because they're fun and they're full of deliciousness?  Isn't that, isn't the point of banana? 
[02:36:00]  That's why I eat a banana.  Whoa.  You know, you know that one guy that hangs out with a group of friends, and he's always  carrying a ladder?  He's always got a ladder with him, you know?  You're like, dude, why do you have a ladder?  He's like, because I want to be taller than you.  Now step off.  I'm excited what I'm going to start doing now, is I'm just going to carry a chair everywhere  I go, you know?  Like I'll walk into a party and be like, what's up?  I brought my own chair.  Then I'll sit down, and I can stand up, sit down, stand up.  You know what I'm talking about?  This is a fun game you can try.  You know what you can do?  You can try this.  When you go, when you go up to get, like, fast food, you know?  You go up to the drive-thru, you know? 
[02:36:30]  And you're like, yeah, I would like a steak au poivre and a duck l'orange.  And they're going to be like, dude, it's a fast food restaurant.  We don't have that kind of food for you.  I want to walk around, and whenever I see a little kid in the street, I want to put a  little gold star on their forehead and say, congratulations.  And then punch them in the face and be like, sorry, not today.  You know what I'm going to do next time?  I have to go on a flight.  What I'm going to do is I'm going to put on a big fake beard.  I'm going to put on a turban.  I'm going to walk around with a time bomb and see how long it takes them then to stop  me at airport security.  And when they stop me, I'm going to be like, what's up?  I'm American.  Check out my visa.  Bonk. 
[02:37:00]  So one day, I'm going to get married.  I'm going to meet my bride's mother.  My mother-in-law.  She's going to walk into me like, oh, hello, Dane.  It's very nice to meet you.  I'm going to be like, boom, boom.  Now your face is broken.  You know the movie Jaws?  Everyone knows the movie Jaws, right?  The movie Jaws.  Famous movie Jaws, right?  Right, right.  What if instead of sharks, it was puppies?  You know?  You'd be like in the water like, oh my God, this puppy's licking me.  I can't get it away from me.  I can't take it anymore because it's a puppy and puppies are adorable.  That's what I think.  You know how like when you're in France, you know, like you're walking around France, you 
[02:37:30]  know, like people like to walk around France and they're like, man, I'm hungry.  I want a Big Mac.  You go, where's the McDonald's?  And they go, oh, I'm sorry, but they'll have McDonald's.  And I go, well, your country sucks.  Oh, that's a good parody.  Yeah, visually too.  Yeah, there's a lot of like visuals and the guy who's doing it, like a lot of real quick  turns to the camera and staring, making that Dane face.  It's actually quite, quite funny.  All right, let's say hi to Jay in Dallas.  Jay, Patrice is going to be down there at the Improv in Addison, by the way, this weekend. 
[02:38:00]  What do you got for the show?  Hey, you talking to Jay?  Yeah, you.  Yeah.  Hey, sorry, man.  Hey, I was calling about that dude's face trucker.  I think I know what he was trying to say about Carlin.  Okay.  Basically, like when Carlin prepared for an HBO special, like he'd workshop his shows.  And so he would know exactly where he was going to be on stage, where he was going to  look in the audience.  I mean, he would have every detail of his show planned out for one of his specials.  So he'd workshop that stuff, right? 
[02:38:30]  And so I think what's best to get at is why indict Chris Rock for the exact same thing  Carlin would do before one of his specials.  I wasn't saying that was bad.  It's like, but when you cut where he's in another country, it was distracting.  I just found that distracting.  I hear he was wearing different clothes, too.  Yeah.  He was?  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  I don't know, guys.  I was just trying to clear that up.  It's gimmicky.  But that isn't even really why I didn't like the special.  I just didn't like, like, I didn't find it really funny. 
[02:39:00]  I wasn't sitting there really laughing my ass off.  Right.  That's all.  I don't know.  Maybe it's just out of bad frigging, you know, this is one of his bad sets.  Right.  I don't fucking know.  What do I know?  All right.  It's my opinion.  All right.  We can move on to some other things.  We're going to take a quick break.  When we get back, we got to talk about this doll.  What?  This Islam doll.  Where is it?  Yeah.  The woman who thinks the Fisher-Price baby doll says Islam is the light. 
[02:39:30]  Really?  I'm sure it does.  Oh, is it one of these that...  These come out like what?  Yeah, every couple of years something comes out and it doesn't sound like it.  I think they do this as a marketing ploy because no one knows about this doll, but now we're  all talking about this thing.  What is it?  What kind of doll?  We'll get into it after the break.  I don't even know.  Fuck toy.  We got some gossip as we go to break.  Some PTG.  We're back.  And just when you thought the dust had settled in gossip land, primetime gossip is here to  shake things up again.  As we all know by now, speculation has been running amok after Opie's announcement that 
[02:40:00]  one of the ONA cast members would be leaving the show.  Someone very, very, very important to this radio show is leaving.  It's not myself.  It's not Anthony.  It's not Jimmy.  Now we here at Primetime Gossip thought we had it all figured out until this piece of  audio hit our doorstep.  I'm sick of myself.  Then I'm standing up.  Wait, wait, wait.  I think I might have got the tracks as I reversed.  Oh, no.  Danny, no.  You did not.  What?  Oh, my God.  Danny is so fired. 
[02:40:30]  Is Danny leaving the show?  Oh, no.  That's right.  After all this speculation, we now know, without having any real information, that it is Danny  who is leaving the show.  While we don't have any concrete confirmation, PTG will state as fact that within days, Danny  will go from being an alcoholic radio producer to just being an alcoholic.  So long, Danny.  You never had a shot at winning Afro Wars anyway.  In other news, could Obi and Anthony's Anthony be looking for a new drinking buddy? 
[02:41:00]  Stay tuned as PTG keeps you informed.  All right.  We're setting up for our big interview today.  It's going down in about a half hour.  What is this?  Obi and Anthony.  Holy Jesus.  The franchise version of Obi and Anthony.  We'll be interviewing David Tyree today. 
[02:41:30]  Yeah.  He's got a book out.  Yeah.  We got a lot of football fans out there.  You know, a lot of big blue fans.  And David Tyree, of course, was the one that made that ridiculous catch in the Super Bowl.  So he's got a book.  He's got a book called More Than Just the Catch.  A true story of courage, hope, and achieving the impossible.  Oh, yeah.  And Patrice suggested that maybe David Tyree should have made a flip book.  A 45-page flip book? 
[02:42:00]  A flip book.  Where you just go.  Then you flip it and it shows the catch.  1,000 pages so it could be in HD.  HD flip book?  10,000 page flip book.  Look.  HD flip book?  What the fuck?  Look, man.  You know what?  Good for him.  Good for big blue.  We'll never have a Super Bowl ring around our finger, but.  Gives a shit.  But come on. 
[02:42:30]  Come on.  I mean, come on.  Is this also like a self-help, the cycle of success?  Dude, you got to do work.  It says, write down three reasons why you want to accomplish this goal.  Well, how about this?  To achieve a goal that's very important to you.  Let me play a game.  Don't do this, y'all.  Go to a page.  Ready?  Yeah.  I will start.  Page 174.  All right.  Let me go to 174.  God.  I'm there.  All right.  Page. 
[02:43:00]  Page 173.  God.  Swear to God.  Look.  Right there.  Oh, it's on there the whole thing.  Oh, I see.  Page 81.  Jesus Christ.  81, 81.  Oh!  It's on 174.  God.  All right.  Let's try it again.  Jesus Christ.  Page 110.  Since I became a Christian on March 14th, 2004, my perspective on life has changed dramatically.  110 Christ.  So he's born again, too.  Oh, man.  Oh, man.  Oh, man. 
[02:43:30]  Okay.  I have nothing to do with this one, man.  He made a catch.  I am bowing out of this motherfucker, man.  I swear to God.  He made a catch.  And he's a born-again Christian.  Right.  Small beginnings are gifts from God, and all greatness must start there.  Overnight success has...  Small beginnings.  Small nowings.  Small nowings.  Great men understand that they are born with the potential for greatness inside them.  Mm-hmm.  This process entails allowing God to take them from one level of glory to the next. 
[02:44:00]  Right.  Too much glory from the world all at once has stifled the potential of many great men and  women.  I have learned to be content with my portion and wait on God.  Mm-hmm.  Holy Jesus Christ.  How are we going to do this?  How are we going to do this?  I already told you.  Dude, he made one catch.  We're having to...  We're going to have...  Don't do this, man. 
[02:44:30]  Don't fucking do this.  I'm telling you, I can't.  We're going to do the franchised version of the opening of this show tonight.  Oh, my God.  God, please.  Oh, boy.  Oh, no.  And then his diet.  His diet is in the back of the book.  What he eats.  Really?  Well, you had to fill up the 100 pages.  Is this more than just the catch?  More than just the catch.  I woke up this morning.  I took a dump.  I walked to the kitchen.  One foot.  Two foot. 
[02:45:00]  One foot.  One foot.  Left.  Right.  I went to the fork drawer.  This is more than just the catch.  Oh, God.  No.  What the fuck?  What am I doing with my career?  The forward is by Eli Manning.  I could, you know.  Well, where's my book?  Write your book.  Fuck it.  You gave it to Opie?  All right.  Hey, you know what?  Opie's got my book.  Does Anthony have a copy of the book? 
[02:45:30]  Yeah.  Anthony's got a copy as well.  Danny, what do you do in your book?  I Google.  The Danny.  The Danny story.  More than just Googling.  More than just Googling.  The Danny story.  More than just a computer monitor.  Ah, yeah.  More than a Google to me.  I push buttons sometimes, too, you know.  Yeah.  Yeah, kid.  I remember a day back in early spring.  A button needed to be pushed.  I leaned over and I pushed the button. 
[02:46:00]  I thought I had something.  I was like, should I turn the mic on?  I don't know.  My tank real bad.  I'm going to go for it.  I pushed the button.  And God gave me the courage.  And here's some pictures in the middle.  Me Googling September 7th.  Holy shit.  Oh, my God.  Is this going to suck monkey ass?  Let me see your book.  This is going to suck.  Let me see your book.  If you guys.  If it's not the franchise version.  Yeah.  It's going to be the franchise version.  Okay. 
[02:46:30]  Because if it's the real version.  We're trying to franchise out the show.  I'm like leaving the building.  Leaving this room.  Yeah.  The building.  Because I just can't deal with this one, man.  Let me see.  How many pictures?  The picture's got to be at least good.  Could we first.  Are there any posters around with our fucking faces on?  No.  Good deal.  All right.  All right.  The picture section is good.  I love the photo section.  Because I'm sure there are so many.  Here's his eighth grade graduation trip to Hershey, Pennsylvania. 
[02:47:00]  What's wrong?  Problem, Steve?  Problem?  Yes.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Go ahead, Ant.  You know what's funny about Steve real quick?  His doing the right thing is the same face as the doing the wrong thing face.  Yeah.  Like, he's coming to tell some good news, but it's like it.  I thought it was some bad.  That's a good observation.  At this point, I set foot in the studio, and I know I'm going to get hit with a hail of gunfire.  It's just pictures of him and his wife and kids. 
[02:47:30]  This is, I cannot, I have never seen a more who gives a fucking shit book in my life.  I'm sorry.  It had to be said.  Why?  What's wrong with the book?  Dude, I could care fucking less.  I cannot believe.  I wouldn't read this if I was stranded on a fucking island.  I wouldn't read the book called The Whole Manning Family as told by Archie. 
[02:48:00]  The day my wife pushed out Eli was a wonderful day.  Like, it's nothing.  Can I have my version of the book?  Please.  Are you fucking, I can't believe this.  Here it is.  The catch that, this is by Eli Manning.  The catch that David made was great.  But as you read this book, you will see that God has been doing great things in his life  for quite some time.  Oh, my God.  Well, there were some God people on the Patriots, too, you know.  Like, yeah.  What happened to those guys? 
[02:48:30]  What the fuck?  The greatest play in Super Bowl history?  Judge for yourself.  I believe it is.  Oh, my God.  This is all about, it's like, it's.  I'm trying to equate it to some other, like, event where you would write a book about it  and it would be equally as fucking inane and useless.  Ready?  Yes, please.  The guy who was the agony and defeat guy on Wild World Sports.  At least he was on TV every fucking week. 
[02:49:00]  I'm better than this.  That guy.  Just called, ouch.  More than a broken leg.  More than a busted spleen.  Right.  The agony and defeat guy.  This is, okay, another book would be Subway Superman.  Yeah.  He jumped on that fucking guy and they wrote a whole book about it.  Mm-hmm.  Let me see.  Like him just jumping on the fucking guy.  This is genius where you go, wait a minute.  I got, because you know what?  The Wild World Sports guy, the agony and defeat, he is significant. 
[02:49:30]  He's on TV every, was on TV every week.  It's like, and everyone, the agony of defeat.  Like, what?  Ready?  Here it is.  Okay.  You a sports guy?  Uh, meh.  All right.  Not really.  You a sports guy, O?  Yeah.  Ready?  The guy?  You ever hear the immaculate reception?  Of course.  I did hear that.  The guy the ball bounced off of.  Not even the guy that actually caught an apple.  For Franco to catch it.  The guy that it hit. 
[02:50:00]  You know that guy walks around and goes, look, here's the heel.  This is my heel.  This is my heel.  This is the famous heel.  The fucking guy that the ball bounced off of.  You know what?  The guy sitting next to Bartman from Chicago.  You know how bad the picture?  Who didn't catch it.  You know how bad the picture section is in the book?  He actually reenacts the catch right next to the picture of the catch.  Yeah.  They got the picture of the catch.  And then him holding the ball against his head.  Fuck me, man.  To show what.  I can't.  I can't. 
[02:50:30]  I can't.  If his teammates aren't teasing him about this book.  Yeah.  That means two things.  He's creepy religious.  Yeah.  And he can really, really fight.  Yeah.  And he can kick some ass.  There's two things we could do here.  We could do the franchised version of the Opie and Anthony show.  Yes.  That's such a genius thing to say.  Or we could attempt to do 20 minutes where all we talk about is the catch.  No.  No.  I can't.  I can't do this.  And he tries to change the subject and we try to come up with more angles on the catch. 
[02:51:00]  But his book is more than just.  But look how small the letters are for more than just.  And then the catch is big letters.  Right.  Like, so, really, when you first look at that.  First of all, he didn't do the book.  No, it was written by the little name under his name.  It says with Kimberly Daniels, which means she's the writer.  You know, we're wrong.  That damn fucking sound on this god fucking pal talk.  Listen, we're wrong, though, because on Amazon, the book's doing very well.  It's at number, want to guess? 
[02:51:30]  460.  We are so wrong about this.  Amazon.  Really?  Guess where it is on Amazon.  I'll say.  It's selling, my friends.  Number 5,000.  5,000?  Patrice?  I can mention it listed.  It has to be.  First of all, it's only Uber Giants fans.  There's Giants fans who went to the rally, who took a shit on it.  Like, get the fuck out of here. 
[02:52:00]  They bought a bobblehead.  They wouldn't buy a David Tyree bobblehead.  It's, if whatever the listing is for new books, if it's 75, it's 74.  It is number 7,2, 0, 8.  7,200.  There are 7,207 other books people would rather read.  I bet you some of those books are books that are coming. 
[02:52:30]  Wait, wait.  The IMDb?  Wait, hold on.  Please tell me what the one just above it is.  I got to tell you, 7,208.  And just below it.  What it's beating.  There's not even 7,000 readers in the United States.  What is the book right before it and right after it?  I'd love to know.  Of Mice and Men.  It's still selling.  Yeah, this came out in 52.  Fucking the guy that the ball bounced off of.  You're right.  How can you do this?  See, this is why I'm all mixed emotions, because sometimes you go on a radio show, 
[02:53:00]  and they don't know you, and you go, you just don't want to be made fun of.  Right.  But you don't, what the fuck?  Are you, who is, who could fucking do this?  Except for good morning, you know, good day fucking San Francisco.  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  This should never, ever have been booked here.  Is this a new book?  It comes out tomorrow.  Oh, it comes out tomorrow?  Oh, so that's the pre-order.  Pre-order.  So it's doing well pre-order.  Is it? 
[02:53:30]  Well, how many books are there?  If it is, if it's 12,000 books.  I think there's a dozen, and we got four of them.  Watch.  Come on, man.  Some of the chapters are good.  Dude, no, they're not.  Yes, there is.  There's something for everybody in this book.  I, I, I would.  Dude.  There's something for everybody in it.  Fucking constipated.  If that was on the back of my toilet, I'd read the fucking toilet.  Yeah, I'd read something out of the garbage, a tampon wrapper.  It says his name. 
[02:54:00]  It's like, if you're just a person, you go, you go, okay, what?  And then you go, by who has told to what?  Like, you did, it's just, David, who has told to Kimberly what?  What the fuck?  What the fuck indeed?  I, uh.  Well, you got my childhood days.  That should be good.  Why?  Uh, athletics, my way out.  Traveling down the wrong track.  High school days.  I wouldn't fucking like.  An SU orange man. 
[02:54:30]  Baby mama.  A ticket to the NFL.  Like Joe fucking Theismann.  From freedom to bondage to freedom.  Like, I wouldn't read.  You wouldn't give a fuck.  A whole chapter on just that leg snapping.  Look, man.  I still wouldn't read it.  Maybe Jim Brown.  Maybe Dick Buckus.  Dick Buckus.  The idea of a guy who used to be feared in the NFL.  Dude, OJ had a book out talking about murdering two people when I was read it.  Where's the Emerson Boozer book?  Right.  If I killed the bitch.  Right.  No one read that. 
[02:55:00]  If I killed the bitch.  Here's exactly how I killed the bitch.  By OJ Simpson.  And we couldn't be bothered.  If I stole back my sports memorabilia.  That's my new book.  Oh, wait.  I did.  More than a slash to the jugular.  Oh, Jesus.  Yeah.  More than a partial decapitation.  Right.  By OJ as told to Judge Ito.  I don't know.  What's wrong with the books we got? 
[02:55:30]  They read pretty good.  Yeah.  What's some of those other books?  The Dictionary.  The Star of Mice and Man.  Oh, fuck, man.  The Stant.  Harry Potter.  I don't want to.  I just don't want to.  I don't want to do this.  This is so wrong, man.  You have to be the guest.  Guess what?  You have to be.  Man, I can't.  Fucking Kato Kalins.  More than just a bump in the air conditioner. 
[02:56:00]  Because this is the Giants.  You know what?  Here's what's happening now.  Right now.  If no Giants are listening.  I mean, hopefully they practice.  I don't know what they're doing.  But if there's any Giant fans.  I mean, this is the biggest bridge burn in history.  This is like.  This is.  But what else are we supposed to do?  There's no way I can sit here and interview a guy that caught one fucking catch.  It's delusional.  And is born again.  I have a hard time.  It's delusional to do this. 
[02:56:30]  It's like, what the fuck?  Are you serious?  I don't know how this got booked.  Look.  Let me just.  I'm just going to go to page.  Here he goes.  I can write a book.  Dude.  I'm still thinking about making that catch.  It continues.  Page 149.  God.  You just randomly.  I've always been with me.  Yes.  God is.  God's on every page.  I also pray for the will of God in finding a wife.  Yeah.  God knows what's best.  This is all on one page.  God knows what's best in finding a wife.  All right.  This is all God on one page.  I thank God for my mother.  God will bless you. 
[02:57:00]  God has always been with me.  Moving down.  All right.  Ready.  Right now.  Flip to another place.  Right now.  God knows what is best for us.  God knew what?  God in finding a wife.  God was faithful to send me a wife who loved the Lord.  Wow.  All right.  Flip it.  Ready.  Let me stop you.  No.  You give me a page.  Wait.  I'm going to.  Wait.  Flip it.  Flip it.  I'm going to say stop.  Just.  You should just give me.  All right.  Whatever.  Now.  All right.  Mm-hmm.  Find God on that page.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God. 
[02:57:30]  God.  It's the God look.  It's God.  Woo.  It's the Bible.  It's written by David Tyree.  But then there's.  I sat in a holy cell.  There was no one in there but me.  And.  And.  God.  That's right, Anthony.  Can I.  Can I do.  Like.  I've.  I've never heard.  I've heard this gentleman speak either.  Mm-hmm.  But can I do what I believe it's going to sound like?  Sure.  Okay.  Maybe we should do this.  It's just going to be like.  Hello.  Yeah.  I picture very soft spoken and like pulling teeth for anything. 
[02:58:00]  Yeah.  Like you said.  He didn't write the book.  Whoever did.  Kimberly.  But it's going to be one of those.  Well.  Yes.  God.  Very important to me.  My wife.  Okay.  So now after the catch.  You guys.  You.  What.  Like.  What.  What.  What were they saying to you?  Was everybody was very happy?  Is it on YouTube, Danny?  Maybe.  Maybe.  It's something on YouTube.  He's interviewed.  I just picture.  Worst interview ever.  Why don't we make believe we didn't.  We don't know he's into the God thing. 
[02:58:30]  And go.  Oh, man.  The broads.  You must have got.  Oh, you must be fucking like a mad man.  With that Super Bowl ring.  You must be getting pussy all over the place.  All right.  What do we got?  Interview.  Okay.  Here's.  You know.  After the Super Bowl.  Life, I'm sure, has been quite a whirlwind for you.  Can you tell us a little bit about some of the things you've been doing?  Oh, man.  It's been drastic changes.  You know.  I had a time to do a nice little circuit in L.A.  Between L.A. and Jimmy Kimmel.  NFL Network.  Hanging out with ESPN.  All kinds of stuff.  And then lots of charity work.  Got a nice charity event going on this Thursday with Children of the City. 
[02:59:00]  Just getting out there, you know.  Out of all the things you've done.  Everything that's.  He's here.  He's quiet.  Seriously?  Holy shit.  Holy shit.  What are we doing now?  He's not in there, though?  He's in the bathroom.  Oh, go.  Hide me too, Rabbit.  Hide me too.  All right.  The franchise version of the Opie and Anthony show.  Here it goes.  Quick.  Hurry, hurry, hurry.  I'm in the middle of the show.  I'm just sitting in a chair, dude.  Oh, go.  Hey, Opie. 
[02:59:30]  I'm Ant.  Oh, hey, Ant.  Here comes Opie.  Sorry about that interruption.  So, uh, Opie, who do we have coming in next?  Uh, we've got, uh, David Tyree.  Tyree?  Oh.  Football guy.  Yeah, he made that catch.  Yeah.  I tell you, I don't usually watch football, but I saw that Super Bowl, and it was incredible, 
[03:00:00]  that catch.  Is that all he's famous for?  Well, I mean, it was a famous catch in the Super Bowl.  Where is he?  I thought they were bringing him in.  Yeah, do we have, uh, David Tyree coming in at all?  Steve!  Get Steve.  Yes.  Is anyone working back there?  He's in production.  I'm gay.  Steve!  I thought you said David Tyree was here.  He's using the facility, guys.  I was busy staring at him. 
[03:00:30]  I, I, I will fire you.  I will fire you.  You do not pour water on me.  Sorry, I was gonna pour water on you.  How about talking to a mic that works, Steve?  Oof.  How about potting one up that works?  Yeah, it's on.  You don't talk to...  Yes, I do.  We'll both fire you!  Why, why are we talking to Steve?  Where's David Tyree?  Steve, get David Tyree.  Why do I threaten to fire people so much?  Because...  It's Opie's job.  Well.  So we're killing time here, is what you're saying. 
[03:01:00]  Where's E-Rock?  Eating somewhere?  Probably.  Fat piece of shit, crying over in some manner.  Whatever.  Alright, we're killing time.  Oh, here he is.  David Tyree.  David Tyree.  What's going on?  Welcome to the show, sir.  Take a seat.  Right here, hanging on.  How are you doing?  I'm Opie.  Alright.  Anthony, sir.  Pleasure to meet you.  Thanks for seeing you, gentlemen.  How are you doing?  Stop it. 
[03:01:30]  Hang on, man.  Hang on.  We the first you're talking to today, or have you come to somewhere else?  No, I'm hanging out over on Channel 11 for a hot minute.  Ah.  CW11.  We know them very well.  Very well.  Yes, we have some history.  Yes.  That's what's up.  So, David.  What's the deal?  You're promoting a book.  Yeah.  It would be nice if we had a copy of the book somewhere.  Oh, there's one right there.  I think I got one.  Take mine.  Take a look at that there.  I've read it already.  More than just the catch. 
[03:02:00]  Yeah.  Want to fill us in a little bit about this book here?  It's a little bit of everything, you know?  All the crazy stuff that I went through in my life, you know, stemming from just a crazy  young kid growing up, drugs, alcohol, mostly marijuana, all that, you know, all the stuff  that we do.  I know a little about that.  A little bit about that?  Yes.  A little, a lot.  Oh, you know, here and there.  Yeah, so, you know, basically, kind of the struggles that I have.  Right, Danny?  Getting up to that point, you know, obviously, being in the NFL, it's not a good mixture, 
[03:02:30]  you know?  Mm-hmm.  So, you know, I basically got arrested, marijuana possession, and that's kind of what led me  to my faith and things like that.  Very nice.  Going through some of the photos here.  Oh, yeah.  I got some classics in there.  You dress up pretty nice.  Every now and then, you know?  Oh, maybe.  Well, you don't need to flirt with him, Ope.  For this one here.  What's this one all about?  You're throwing up a gang sign?  Oh, yeah.  That's like my Jim Jones.  I don't need to listen to Camerun and Dipset much.  Ah, Dipset. 
[03:03:00]  Yes.  Yes.  Dipset is a go.  Yeah.  I was a big fan of Dipset back then, so I was just acting a fool back in the crib.  I see.  I keep it fun, you know?  So, you say you found your faith.  Yeah.  Do you credit that for making this catch, which we're looking at on the cover of the book?  Oh, definitely.  Well, you know, yeah.  You know, obviously, you know, a lot of people, when I say it, people get a little wacko, like,  well, you did make the catch.  I didn't know I made the catch.  I was kind of there.  You know, so, you know, I just, what I mean is that there's no way, you know, human talent  can make that catch. 
[03:03:30]  You know, it's not like I can prepare for it.  You know, I can go in a park and catch balls on my helmet.  But, you know, so, that's what I say, you know, God did it.  Why do you think God was on the side of the Giants?  No, I never said God was on the side of the Giants.  I just said that, you know, people misconstrue that as well.  It's not God was on our side.  God is looking out for anybody that's, you know, that's not willing to defame his name.  You know what I'm saying?  Unless you're a patriot.  It was some pretty good patriots.  I saw some patriots out there that was crushed. 
[03:04:00]  But, you know, the will of God is just the will of God, you know, whether we win or lose.  I see, I see, I see.  How are you recovering from your knee injury here?  I'm ready to go, man.  I've been ready to go for a couple weeks.  First, I was a little upset about being on PUP to begin with.  But, you know, it gave me a little more extra time than I needed, you know, to be strong.  And I'll be out this week, and then I should be back the next week.  I wanted to ask you, Michael Strahan is now an analyst for Fox.  Yeah.  He just made his pick for the season, saying that Dallas is going all the way. 
[03:04:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Now, we were both on the same team last year.  Yeah.  How are you taking that?  Nah, you know, he's got a job to do.  But, you know, it sucked.  I thought he could have went out there and gave us a little bit of love for the first one.  But at the same time, you know, he got a job to do.  And, you know, he just go out there and do his job, and we do all.  If we could get my brother, Elmo, big fan of the Giants, just obsessed with his team.  We can get him on the phone sometime.  I know we have a lot of questions he'd like to ask you. 
[03:05:00]  Oh, sweet.  Mars, why isn't this monitor working?  Again?  It's – oh, there it goes.  Go ahead, Ova, I'm sorry.  No, there's no problem.  Yeah, so it's just odd.  Michael is – we haven't had him on in a while, but he used to come on the show regularly.  Big Mike makes Trey, huh?  Yeah.  Yeah, he's big time now.  How is he doing as far as – I don't want to go into too much detail, but like his things that were going on with his personal life last year.  Has he discussed any of that with you?  No, he never discussed it.  You know, he's not ashamed of it. 
[03:05:30]  So, you know, he'll willingly say – he'll willingly say, you know, he made every conscious effort that she wouldn't get all his money.  But at the same time, you know, things worked out the way they did.  That's his personal business.  I don't really do too much getting into that stuff.  No?  No, no, that's a little dangerous, you know, especially when the guy weighs me about 80 pounds.  I'll leave it alone.  How do you feel about Jerry Rice as a player?  Oh, well, he was my childhood hero, to be honest with you.  I was never a New York fan.  I was a 49ers fan because I grew up, you know, late 80s. 
[03:06:00]  The Niners was running the show, so.  Because sometimes around here we go – we do an impression, Jerry Dice.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Jerry Dice.  Yeah.  That was new.  I never got that one.  Yeah.  But Jerry Rice, he's a solid dude.  You ever met him?  No, no.  We just do Jerry Dice.  You know?  Phenomenal.  Yeah.  But, yeah, that's pretty much it.  Loving this book here.  I do have to ask you about Plaxico.  Oh, yeah. 
[03:06:30]  That's the main and greatest.  Brass?  Brass?  Yeah, Burse.  Burse.  Burse.  Burse.  Hey, Fess.  Fess.  Hey, Fess.  Well, he was suspended for missing practice, allegedly saying that he took his kids to school.  Oh.  That was the excuse for why he missed practice.  Okay.  Yes.  Do you know anything about that?  That's the first I heard because, you know, I'm just – I don't read too much papers.  I knew, you know, I just – I'm reading here.  It's supposedly a bizarre excuse.  That's tough, you know?  That's tough.  You know, we're men that don't get a chance to do that too often. 
[03:07:00]  So, if that's the case, I got a little – I got sympathy for it.  But, yeah, at the same time, you know, he's a grown man and we're grown enough to make decisions for ourselves.  You know, and that's what we got to do.  You know, you got to make decisions.  If you know you got to be at work, it's eventually going to cost you.  But, hey, you just got a new contract.  Have you mispracticed, legitimate reason or not, but has that ever happened to you at any point in your career?  Oh, yeah.  My rookie year, heck, yeah.  I got – I was, like, leading the team in fines, my rookie year when I was – and I was just a wreck that year. 
[03:07:30]  Yeah, you know, I think I had about $10,000 in fines, but it should have been $40,000.  Nothing during your college days?  I see that you went to Syracuse.  Our old Anthony went to Syracuse.  Did you?  No, I didn't even graduate high school.  Oh, that was supposed to be the setup.  Yeah, no, I didn't graduate high school.  In radio, we can do that, make this career.  There's no reason.  That's phenomenal.  We have a fan somewhere outside that wants to say –  One fan.  Yeah.  I'm good for one.  Where is he?  Yeah, hi.  This is Stephen S. from Bayshore, and I'm watching the show today. 
[03:08:00]  Opie, you're such a phony.  You were saying how much the Giants sock and big blue blows and all that.  You're a Jets fan.  I am a big Jets fan.  And here you are kissing David Tyree's ass.  I don't really understand the phoniness that's going on here.  I'm going to leave it to Stephen S. from Bayshore to sell out, Opie.  David, I have to level with you.  I am a Jets fan.  Grew up on Long Island.  Hey, you mad at you, dude?  You're in the prime of your life right now.  Brett Favre's in town. 
[03:08:30]  Yeah, well, I'm not too big to support Brett Favre either.  I think he's a big sellout.  Tell him what you were saying the other day, you know, that this guy's a one-hit wonder.  I mean, all he has in his career is one catch.  You were saying it just the other day.  All right, Opie, if you could maybe hot that mic down.  Way to make me feel big about myself here.  This is what I love about satellite radio.  Yeah, I was just saying that I thought, you know, book, because you caught a football on your head.  You know, what's the deal?  What's the deal? 
[03:09:00]  Why a book?  Why a book?  Yeah.  Because I got a story to tell.  Why the hell you got a radio show?  Oh, every day we wonder the same thing.  They keep paying us.  That's it.  Do you think anybody could have predicted that catch that you made?  No.  That's the best part about it.  Because I think the only way you could have predicted a catch like that is if you had had some kind of sports almanac, like Biff Tannen did.  If you could get, like, a time machine.  Biff.  I'm going to tune out for 20 minutes there. 
[03:09:30]  Head to the future.  Get the sports almanac.  I'm sure there'd be a little footnote in there about that catch, because it would obviously say, you know, the Giants ended the Patriots, you know, winning streak.  Definitely.  And I bet I could create an entire museum dedicated to myself based on the money that I would get from that prediction as well as others.  That would be phenomenal, because I saw it in the movie with you, the sequel.  Yeah.  Which is your favorite back to the future?  Part two.  Really?  Yeah.  All the futuristic, the hoverboards, phenomenal. 
[03:10:00]  Yeah.  Can't beat it.  We had a guest in that their favorite was part three.  They weren't invited back, no.  Thank you.  No.  Where did they get the logs to power the train?  I don't even remember.  I don't think part three got another.  I didn't even give it another watch.  No.  No.  Part one or two, phenomenal.  Yeah.  Do you want to take a phone call?  A couple of listeners calling in, some supporters.  Some supporters.  Maybe not this one.  We're on in Boston.  Okay, good.  And so this is Brian in mass. 
[03:10:30]  Brian, you're on with Mike.  Ah, with David Tyree.  Sorry.  Hello?  Hi, Brian.  Ah, yes, David.  Quick question.  I love the book.  It's called The Catch, correct?  Yeah, more than just The Catch.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm a Patriots fan, and I was just looking at some stats online.  Can you tell me about the other three catches last year?  The other three catches.  What's the point of talking about those?  I don't know.  I just saw online the four-catch season last year.  Yeah.  What happened to the other three catches? 
[03:11:00]  Do they have a chapter?  Boy, you just really missed the whole season, didn't you?  Like, I didn't even, the four catches didn't even matter.  Isn't that the whole gist of it?  Oh, okay.  Okay.  Yeah, geez.  All right, thank you, Brian.  Nice try, Brian.  This isn't a book about all the catches.  He caught the thing on his head with his fingertips, for God's sake.  Let's talk to, um, from Yellowstone.  Lady Trucker.  Lady.  Hello.  Hello, David?  Yeah, what's going on? 
[03:11:30]  Hey, how old were you when you first played football?  When I first played, I don't know, 11 or 12?  Oh, no!  David believes the shit that Whitehall Shriek babbles.  I don't even know what that meant.  I don't even know what that meant.  Sometimes we get prank callers here.  And, uh, and there's not much we could do about it except maybe talk to a different phone screener.  You know what I mean?  I'm sorry about that.  That's the good stuff.  Let's talk to, uh, take one more here.  Cody in Indiana.  Cody. 
[03:12:00]  Cody!  Yeah.  Hi, David.  How are you?  What's going on, Cody?  Hey, uh, I, I know that, that you, uh, you probably think that it's all part of divine  intervention for an amazing catch like that.  Was it anything like the movie Angels in the Outfield to you?  Hmm.  Anything like Angels in the Outfield?  Um, I don't know if you could see my angels.  Yeah.  I mean, Christopher Lloyd is just amazing.  I think he, he crystallizes an experience like that perfectly.  And, and if it was anything like that, I mean, that's amazing. 
[03:12:30]  Well, we all know Christopher Lloyd's amazing.  He created the flux capacitor after all, you know?  Yeah.  Well, have a good day, David.  Thank you.  Hey, take it easy, boss.  I mean, who would have thought that one person could take a car like the DeLorean, you know?  And then you, a little plutonium, a flux capacitor.  A flux capacitor.  And, you know, it's flying through the sky.  That's phenomenal.  Into the future.  88 miles per hour is all you need.  Can't beat that.  They could send a dog, Einstein.  They could send, you know.  It's a nice setup.  I got it. 
[03:13:00]  I don't remember.  Oh, well, yeah, this is our very own XM studio.  Serious XM now, I guess, since the merger.  But, yeah, they built this studio just for us in the Ron and Fez show that comes on after us from noon to 3.  This is sweet.  Yes.  Another question about a teammate of yours, Tiki Barber.  Oh, yeah, TikTok.  Career suicide going through the Today Show.  Missed out on the ring.  He did.  You guys still talk to him?  Yeah, we still talk to him.  You know, I think he's had enough, you know, you know, I'm sure he's, I don't want to say he's regretting the situation, but, you know, it was kind of rough when he was under the bus at the beginning of the season. 
[03:13:30]  You know, when he started off 0-2 and he's like, Giants are pitiful.  And, you know, so I think, you know, he paid for it, you know, and there's no reason for us to rub it in his face.  You know, he did some good things for us.  Yeah.  I think we have another audience member who has a question.  What's the deal?  You're on.  How could you?  Where is he?  Softballs at this guy.  David, do you know that that OP guy right there, he doesn't believe in God and he makes fun of people that believe in God. 
[03:14:00]  There we go.  That's why I'm here.  That's what I'm here for.  Yeah.  We're not practicing going to church-wise, but I don't think I'm totally not into the God thing.  I just, I'm very skeptical.  I can understand people who are skeptics.  You know what?  You got a reason to be skeptic.  You know, when you look at so many hypocrites out there, it's a lot of hypocrites.  That's a lot of reason.  And since we're sharing, I got to admit something else.  This is a confession. 
[03:14:30]  This is sweet.  You're already into it, bro.  This is Greg Hughes, the actor who plays Opie.  I know I said I was a Jets fan.  I really haven't been into football for a while now.  I'm all about the Tiger Woods golf.  You playing that?  No.  I'm on the PS3.  That's sucking games.  That's sucking video games.  It's not, you know, what's the Madden rule?  It's like 21-0 and you're off, right?  Yeah.  You're off the sticks.  I gave up like three years ago.  They just kept 21 skunking me.  Well, if you get the new Tiger Woods, I'm XMOP on there.  Okay.  If you'd like to befriend me on the PS3 network. 
[03:15:00]  I do have the PS3, you know, even though I rarely get on.  Now, when you, when that ball was coming down from the sky, did you feel like it was, it  looked almost like a missile coming from a ship.  Like, you know.  The Enola Gay is dropping bombs on the Super Bowl.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  It was like Chariots of Fire, dude.  Yeah.  I had like a soundtrack playing in the background while it's in the air.  Like Hiroshima.  Right?  Yeah.  It was wild, man. 
[03:15:30]  Wow.  We got some outstanding sound effects.  Come on.  We try to keep production value.  Our interns obviously sit there reading papers.  They're interns?  Yeah.  That's one of our interns.  It's Sam.  Wow.  But he's phenomenal.  What's going on, Sam?  Obviously, he does nothing but sit on the couch and read the paper, you know.  That's great.  I get water.  Yeah.  Thanks, Sam.  We got the water.  Thank you.  So, touch back on the book for a tiny bit here.  Yeah.  Like he touched on the football.  Oh, you're quick.  Yes.  Books on tape.  You got anything in the works? 
[03:16:00]  Are you going to voice it?  I probably got it.  You going to get somebody a little more voice experience or something?  Yeah.  That's not my thing, you know.  And why don't you do the book on tape?  That'd be sweet.  Why don't you give them a little example there?  Yeah.  Give them a little flavor.  Okay.  Well, for instance, like Ronald Reagan might read the book and say like,  Well, this book is a story of the life of a man who lives.  This book is a story of the. 
[03:16:30]  This book is.  I just, you know, it's because he has Alzheimer's.  That's a good story.  Well, he did.  Oh, I'm getting a communicator.  Obviously, he's dead now.  Oh, oh, is on his cell phone.  Um, yeah, I guess.  Oh, it's him.  What's wrong?  Oh, boy.  Oh, how's I don't know.  How's the book been doing in terms of sales and stuff? 
[03:17:00]  Uh, I don't know.  Last I heard with the first week, it was like 12,000 the first week.  Oh, that's great.  Is it?  I think I don't know.  I haven't sold any books.  I was waiting for somebody to tell me it was doing all right.  But, you know, it's cool.  Whether it does good or right.  Well, it's 12,000 more than I've sold.  Well, I don't have a radio show, so you got me on, you know, you got me on that deal.  Well, maybe we'll sell some more books today.  Yeah, why don't you give the big book for the book there?  More than just a catch.  More than just the catch.  A true story of courage, hope, and achieving the impossible by David Tyree with Kimberly Daniels. 
[03:17:30]  Who's Kimberly Daniels?  She's like my spiritual mom, you know.  Oh, okay.  You know, she just pours into my life, you know.  Keeps me, keeps me, keeps me going high.  All right.  I got to communicate here that they're telling us he has to go.  Sweet.  Where are you off to now?  You doing television?  No, no television.  I think I'm pretty much done for the day.  You come out and hang out, you know.  It's not, you know, I don't think it's that big of a deal.  We can hang out for a few moments.  Okay, great.  If one thing before you go, if you could help us. 
[03:18:00]  Anthony rarely asks for photos.  He's a little intimidated and embarrassed by that.  Could we get a photo for Opie's eye with you and Anthony there?  We can hang out.  We can do it.  You want to do it live on the air here?  All right, Opie, let's do it live on the air.  I like this, dude.  Are all these mics on?  Yeah, they're all on.  All right, we'll take this one.  I thought they were all on.  Yeah.  Let's get a photo right there.  Take care.  Lined up nice.  There we go.  Thank you very much.  David Tyree.  That was awesome, dude. 
[03:18:30]  More than just the catch book is out now.  Go out and get it.  It won't burn you.  Yes.  Thank you so much for coming in.  We're going to take a break.  We'll be right back.  We're back with the Sam and E-Rock show.  Holy shit.  I'm Sam.  There's E-Rock over there.  Dude.  That was so cringing.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  I was right here in the studio sitting on the couch.  Yeah.  With a newspaper just kind of hanging out to watch the whole thing.  E-Rock was petrified when you were one of the audience members saying that he, my goal 
[03:19:00]  is to get E-Rock a fist sandwich.  He hates the Giants.  He's a one catch wonder.  He doesn't like God.  And E-Rock's just like, you were without words a couple of times.  And Sam's performance as Anthony was brilliant.  It was just brilliant.  The Ronald Reagan impression.  Yeah. 
[03:19:30]  Talking about Back to the Future.  The all righty.  The Enola Gay is dropping bombs on the Super Bowl.  I was wondering where you were going with that.  It was like a missile coming at you.  The Enola Gay.  God damn it.  You fucking funny.  Let's say hi to Greg in New Hampshire.  Jerry Dice was hysterical.  Hey, what's going on, boys?  Hey.  That's why I pay money to listen to the radio.  That was fucking with somebody on a whole nother level. 
[03:20:00]  Oh.  I'm a lifeline Pat fan, and that was cathartic.  The Enola Gay.  All right, bro.  Dropping bombs on the Super Bowl.  What the fuck does that even mean?  And then you hang E-Rock out again when he goes, yeah, Anthony went to Syracuse.  No, I didn't graduate from high school.  That really wasn't fair.  Hold on, hold on.  It really wasn't fair because E-Rock, before we even did that, he was like, all right.  Because he was doing all this football research because he wanted it to go smoothly. 
[03:20:30]  Yeah.  And he was like, all right.  I knew nothing of football.  He was like, all right.  It says here he went to Syracuse, so this could be one of our outs.  I'll just say our own Anthony went to Syracuse.  And I was like, yeah.  And I'll just be like, yeah, and talk about Syracuse.  And then he just goes, no, I didn't.  I didn't graduate from high school.  What are you talking about?  He ends it right there.  I was in character.  Oh, you certainly were.  That was very good.  That was hardcore, man.  Oh.  I wouldn't have been able to pull that off.  Guys, yeah, believe me.  I had a tear of my eye on the back. 
[03:21:00]  Like, I just was, it just was shakingly, I cannot believe Sam.  And then E-Rock did the email.  He goes, oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  And the phone calls were fucking brutal.  You know what was really aggravating him?  I saw him, he was giving me the eye.  Oh, you were tapping.  You were doing the O-B tapping.  And he kept looking at where I was tapping.  And E-Rock was tearing the papers, too.  Yeah, yeah.  You had the pen in it.  All you hear is this.  Going on as he's trying to fucking talk. 
[03:21:30]  Stop stalking.  And then you rang the bell for no reason.  E-Rock, stop doing that.  Stupid horn.  Stop stalking me.  You had me down way too long.  Oh, that was good.  That was the most, that was the greatest, worst thing I've ever had.  Yeah, it was horrific to watch.  See, we could officially franchise the show.  Yeah, we got to do that again.  That's the goal right now.  Right when he walked in, he goes, oh, you guys' reputation precedes you.  It's like, yeah, does it?  Well, now I know who's leaving the show.  It's got to be Roland, because he's going to be so fired.  Dude, Roland was in the back, just talking to me, and I just felt, he's like, I'm ruined. 
[03:22:00]  I'm ruined.  I'm ruined.  There goes my connection with the NFL.  But if anybody, if he has any friends, for real, nobody on a, you know, I've played sports in my life.  There's no way that we don't tease you for writing a book.  About one catch.  For one catch.  For a catch.  There's no way.  Is it true we only had four catches last year?  God, that was a great call.  Hey, what about the other three catches? 
[03:22:30]  Oh.  You know, your four catches.  That one made me want to jump out the window.  That was hard.  That was hard to fucking sit by.  Just to go home.  I'm going home.  Oh.  God damn it, man.  And then when you said, yeah, something, and then you went, for God's sake.  I'm like, oh, no.  You're taking the name of God in vain.  Great job.  Oh, man.  Well, thank God now we know what we can do when we don't want to interview people.  Roland will take all guests.  Book whoever you want. 
[03:23:00]  Every guest we are now taking.  Every single guest.  Because we don't have to fucking sit here and interview one of them.  That's right.  I don't care who they want to book anymore.  Oh, my God.  You guys were great.  Were you just heating up inside when I was going after?  Yeah, thanks for that.  He's the best.  Opie, you're such a hypocrite.  Well, hopefully you'll get some golf friends.  Yeah, thanks.  I appreciate it.  You got your plug out there. 
[03:23:30]  Yeah, well, what are you going to do?  That was very good, guys.  Very funny.  That was a lot of fun.  I'm glad we didn't have to sit through that as a real interview.  Fuck.  I noticed the best, too, was him doing, like, the worst Reagan ever.  Oh, and David Tyree's just laughing along.  Oh, you guys.  Oh, you guys.  He's doing the worst.  It wasn't even a voice.  It's just, well, I like the book.  Well, I like the book. 
[03:24:00]  Because he was forgetting what he was saying.  And then you go, because he has Alzheimer's.  He's been dead.  I forget.  There wasn't a lot of prep.  Because you have Alzheimer's, you forgot that he was dead.  Yeah, I was still doing Reagan.  That was good.  You were in character.  Yeah.  There you go.  Wonderful.  Oh, fuck.  Heading toward the line of the day.  What happened to all the TVs?  The cable went out.  Oh, nice.  Oh, is that what happened?  Yeah, I saw everything froze up for a minute.  I heard they weren't going to pay their bills anymore, right?  Yeah.  I said, fuck it.  Hey.  Oh, God damn. 
[03:24:30]  And Patrice is like, you want to crawl into yourself.  Excuse me.  Holy shit.  What?  That was just.  What are you supposed to do with that?  That was just like the greatest.  That was amazing radio.  I'm just laughing at it.  Because I really went inside of Roland for a second.  Oh, yeah.  Poor Roland.  Like, poor Roland, dude.  And I'm sitting there going, but Roland, this is genius radio.  Like, it's just nothing better. 
[03:25:00]  We had to go that route.  The guy made a catch on the side of his helmet.  It's this giant arrogance there.  Like, you can't.  And then there was a couple of times it was serious, too.  Like, what about the other three?  You know, fuck the other three.  Yeah, he was getting pissed at that.  Like, real.  This is not no deifying shit.  Like, you caught.  You fucking caught it off your helmet.  That helmet had glue on it.  Yeah, yeah.  Shut up.  And he credited God with that catch. 
[03:25:30]  It wasn't him.  He goes, you know, you don't just catch a football between your fingers and a helmet like that.  God gets in there.  So now what, though?  Like, now what?  God did that.  And then now what?  And then I think actually Sam or Anthony asked a brilliant question.  Well, of course, because there's Anthony.  Did God like the Giants better?  That's a legitimate question when you say that God helped you make that catch like that.  Right.  Like, why wouldn't God be more of a Giants fan then?  And when the Giants release him next year because, you know, they gave him an extra year because he did win the Super Bowl for the team. 
[03:26:00]  Did God have something to do with that?  Yeah, with letting you go.  Right.  Oh, boy.  Maybe they said to him, look, you're going to be cut this year, so fake an injury and we'll just have you on the injured reserve all year.  Yeah, sit it out.  Seems like a nice guy.  What are you going to do?  Seem like a nice enough fella.  I couldn't find a football.  I was going to throw it from over there and go, hey, Dave, catch.  See if he can do it again, throw it at his head. 
[03:26:30]  The idea of that book is absurd.  Yeah, who pitched it?  Like, who was there watching?  Like, some guy at that publishing company watched the play and just went, oh, my God, I got to get him to sign a book deal.  He just made this amazing catch and I got to write it.  I got to have him, you know, write a book about it.  How about Eli's book, Beyond the Throw?  The Throw.  Beyond the Throw.  All right, let's do this Fisher Price baby doll. 
[03:27:00]  And then we're going to do lie in the day and get out.  I mean, after that, we really shouldn't even be here anymore.  That's good on your iPhone when an unknown comes up.  It's not blocked or anything.  I don't know you and I'm doing a radio show for God's sake.  Put him on the air.  No, because then you'll yell at me.  No, I won't do it.  That's Jimmy's bit.  Hi, who's this?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  No one there.  It is unknown.  You're lucky.  Beyond the phone call.  I want to.  Now, see, I could.  That would be equal right there.  If I just wrote a book about taking that call on the air. 
[03:27:30]  All right, so there I was.  There I was sitting by my mic and I felt a vibration in my pocket.  And I'm like, that's my phone.  Is it a text?  And then it kept vibrating.  So I knew it was a call.  But it said unknown.  What do I do?  I thought.  I let it ring a while.  And then Opie.  Opie's my on-air partner.  Opie was born in Huntington, Long Island.  And then to go through your whole history.  And then get back to the call eventually.  Holy fuck.  And that's chapter two. 
[03:28:00]  It's like, yeah, yeah.  It's chapter two.  Hitting the button to take the call.  And then another person wrote their book, Beyond the Dialing.  Yeah.  The story of Anthony not picking up the phone.  Just, you fucking made the catch.  Good for you.  Here we go.  Good for you.  Here's the Fisher-Price baby doll.  What did that sound like to you?  Because I'm like, yeah, I think I just heard. 
[03:28:30]  Mia Williams believes this doll, despite its sweet name, is spouting more hate than love.  More hate.  And all of a sudden it says, Islam is the light.  Islam is the light.  And I'm like, I'm like, turn down the radio.  And then it's like, Satan is the king.  Well, Satan is the king?  Well, Satan.  Sure.  He has a story to tell as well.  Islam is the light.  Wait, Satan is the king?  Why doesn't anyone find, like, Satan after a crazy moment like that?  I'm King Satan.  Who are you calling?  Voicemail. 
[03:29:00]  Voicemail or something?  The doll is called the Little Mommy Real Loving Baby Cuddle and Coop.  They were cute.  We were walking past.  And as you walk past, they know.  It's made by Fisher-Price and sold by stores all over the country.  We showed it to another mom.  I heard it say, Islam is the light.  I think that's nuts.  You could pull out the batteries, but Target says they're already pulling it off the shelves.  If you do find you have one, you should bring it in for a return and then contact the manufacturer. 
[03:29:30]  Fisher-Price.  I'm lost.  What was it supposed to be saying?  I don't know.  Did they say?  They're basically saying Islam is the light.  It is?  Do you believe it?  I believe, yeah, the toy companies do this on purpose to get them talking about products.  You know how many people are going out and buying this doll now?  Just because it's the thing to do.  If you have the doll, decapitate it and send it back to Fisher-Price.  Behead it.  Behead the doll as an infidel.  With the Fisher-Price. 
[03:30:00]  Send it back with a receipt and the severed head.  And we'll give you your money back.  Nah, they do that shit on purpose.  I'm convinced of it.  A little publicity.  Sure.  A little publicity for the doll.  All right.  We might as well do line of the day.  Yeah.  It's not getting better than the Sam and E-Rock thing.  Oh, boy, is that a good gimmick for any time we have a guest that we don't want to talk to.  Yeah.  Oh, know what we wanted to do?  Go home?  Well, yeah.  Teasing, of course. 
[03:30:30]  I miss Jimmy.  He'd take that banana and make it like it was a telephone and talk into it.  I hope he just did it.  Well, I did, because he wasn't here.  Oh, good gravy.  Norton's going to be on Leno tonight.  Let's not forget.  Yes.  Hey, we were talking about one-man shows, Patrice, and a lot of people were reminding us about  the Star Wars guy.  How long has that been?  Oh, fuck.  That guy.  About 40 minutes.  40 fucking minutes.  We went with him for 40 minutes?  Didn't we edit it down for...  Are we crazy?  Didn't we edit it down and we didn't get to it?  You're rocking Sam do it.  Yeah.  What happened?  One-man show.  A guy came in and did the whole Star Wars movie as one guy. 
[03:31:00]  And he came in here to do it.  You want to talk about cringe?  I think that was the birth of Ramon or close to it.  Ramon.  CP Rock's got a taste of that.  I want to hear just a little bit of it.  Line of the Day is brought to you by WebEx.com.  Hold meetings, make presentations, and do it from the comfort of your own home or office.  Check it out at WebEx.com.  Danny, did you sit through that?  Were you in here for that whole thing?  I tried.  At first, I sat in here, and once the first 40 seconds went by, I was like, there's no 
[03:31:30]  way I'm going to be able to last.  So I kept kind of going in and out, in and out.  I couldn't make it.  I would try to sit here, and there would come a point where I just had to get up and get  up and get up and get up.  Too many douche chills?  Was he getting mad?  Yeah.  He had to have been.  I didn't not make eye contact.  I just pushed my monitors together and kind of hid so I didn't have to look at them.  Yeah, I was hiding behind a nude favor back there.  Same thing.  So I couldn't want a lot of eye contact happening there.  Here's a runner-up line of the day.  I don't get the black culture with the sneakers.  I just don't get it.  Here's the thing I always do. 
[03:32:00]  It's just different things.  Black people spend all their money on sneakers and maybe some rims, and white people will  buy a life-size replica of Superman for $10,000 and think that that's noble.  That's very, very good.  Patrice is going to be at the Addison Improv for all you Dallas folk.  Star Wars guys, 34 minutes.  Can we get it in this part of the show?  So it's, you know what I mean?  So it replays?  So it stays in the replay?  Yeah.  I can try to do that. 
[03:32:30]  Yeah, I think we should do that.  I can try to do it.  We had some lame stuff earlier.  Cut some of that out.  Lame.  The show is gold.  It's always gold.  Here's another runner-up line of the day.  The question is, a leech has 32 what?  Oh, a leech?  Oh, okay.  A leech.  A leech has 32 what?  A leech?  Miles.  Total alimony payments?  See, there you go.  But that's how you make it funny.  They couldn't make it funny, that dumb show. 
[03:33:00]  No.  Up there in Cleveland.  Another runner-up line of the day.  It's impossible to get a hole in one on a par five.  It's probably never been done.  And I don't watch golf at all.  I'm just playing this game.  I didn't know the game had an option to play the caddy.  Oh, see, because you're in the support for.  Wow, you guys did.  That is some early racism.  Early racism.  It was 6.05.  Jesus.  And I broke out the racism.  Right out of the gates. 
[03:33:30]  Right after the music started.  It was like, and go.  Ecstasy of racism.  Right.  Good God almighty.  Can you imagine real racism like actual slavery?  God damn.  Yeah, right.  3.45.  I got to get caught in you, motherfucker.  Don't you sleep?  Where's the Roland?  Is he still around?  I don't want to know Roland.  Roland.  We'll do another runner-up line of the day, I believe.  Roland is somewhere turning in a circle.  Oh, freaking out.  Just trying to go back to Narnia. 
[03:34:00]  Here's Roland.  Hi.  I told you yesterday I would get you back.  Making fun of my Islanders on email.  I don't know.  Well, Roland, what do you think the, um, any repercussions from that one?  That went well.  I'm not sure they'll be.  Why didn't you walk out?  I'm not sure my Giants tickets will forever be gone.  Oh, yeah.  Why didn't you walk them out?  Why don't?  Because they'll be like.  It's like if you have your friend in here and then they trash or somebody you know.  And you trash and they're like, hey guys, what's up?  Good interview. 
[03:34:30]  He's kind of your friend?  Well, I've known him, yeah.  Oh, you know him?  And tell him the story about the kids.  Yeah.  Their, um, last season when I went to a Giants game, there was like five inner city kids outside.  Just wanted to hear the game.  He brought them all in to the locker room.  Gave them jerseys.  Fed them.  50 R-line seats.  This is the story he's telling me as they're doing the bit.  He's just saying.  Gave them tickets to the next game.  Because they said they'd never been to a football game.  Oh.  Took them on the field.  Did all that stuff.  I asked him, is he a nice guy?  And he tells me this story.  Let me tell you a little story about what a guy is. 
[03:35:00]  Let me tell you how nice he is.  Let me tell you a little story.  And then I hear somebody, Sam or Erock, ripping his book paid.  I shh.  Shh.  Beyond the bringing inner city kids.  That would have been a better book.  Yeah.  There's another book in him.  Yeah.  I know.  I'll wait for the repercussions.  Because I know this will be replayed over there.  So then people go, ah.  Ah.  Who replays it over there?  You.  Oh, over there, though?  Yeah, yeah.  Maybe not.  Maybe we just let that one sit. 
[03:35:30]  Sometimes we have to, you know, be stealth.  Okay, well.  Another runner-up.  So we don't ruin it.  Line of the day.  What do you think the white guy was doing on the pier just waiting, looking at his nails?  Looking at a pocket watch?  Just coming right in.  It wasn't like the music.  He had a musket and it was like, doon, doon, doon, doon, doon, doon, doon, doon, doon.  Be very, very quiet.  Very quiet.  I'm hunting.  Oh, my God. 
[03:36:00]  More goddamn racism.  Oh, Jesus.  Just booking racism in the morning.  It doesn't end with me.  First thing in the morning.  Last thing in the morning.  Doesn't end.  Terrible.  He gets very excited when Patrice is on the show.  Oh, it's fun.  Patrice is, you know.  Patrice is a racist, too.  A net of safety.  If I wasn't.  Partners in racism.  We can have a sitcom.  God, I love racism.  I'll take my racist blows.  Yeah. 
[03:36:30]  I don't care.  To give them out.  Yeah.  You guys should do some buddy films.  Racist buddy films.  I see network TV series.  I do, too, my friend.  For some reason, we have to live in the same house.  We'll be canceled tomorrow.  Yeah, of course.  We'll be canceled the next day.  They're too racist.  I want to thank Roland for giving us that idea today.  Because, you know, I wouldn't know what to do with the David Tyree interview.  And Roland's like, you know what?  Why don't you just have somebody else interview him as you guys?  That was a good idea, Roland. 
[03:37:00]  Roland, I really want to thank you.  Because we were in a tough spot there.  And we got through it.  If I was you, when he said, if I was you, I'd do that.  Because I wouldn't know what to say to the guy.  Right, right.  No, it wasn't.  No.  No.  This is E-Rock.  Ha ha, I'm playing Roland.  No.  No.  I like how E-Rock started the whole thing out trying to be, like, serious.  Yeah.  And do a serious interview.  Yeah.  That fell apart real quick.  I think he was shaking.  Oh, he was.  The entire time.  He was scared.  And then the self-deprecation was pretty funny when he called E-Rock stupid and fat, I believe. 
[03:37:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think he scared David's voice to switch.  He got pissed.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You're sure.  Yeah, but you know what?  It's God.  God's going to make sure none of us get punched in the face.  So that's good.  I hope God doesn't cancel my giant stick.  Amen.  Please, Lord.  He better have a sense of humor, man.  You can't take yourself that serious.  He has to know.  He wrote a book about a catch.  Not even an event.  A fucking just a, you know, I dropped a glass of water. 
[03:38:00]  Like, I wrote a book about that?  Like, come on, man.  Do you ever drop something and bobble it and then catch it, like, at the last minute and  go, like, oh, geez.  Holy shit.  That's book worthy now.  Do you ever drop something and actually save the breaking with your feet?  Yeah.  And you go, that was almost deity-like.  It was amazing.  Like, you could put your foot in the way of something falling and save it with your foot.  That's a book.  You know, if Mr. Brady's book was called More Than Just a Catch, I wouldn't read it. 
[03:38:30]  Oh, unless it was, you know, Mr. Brady from the TV show.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, Tom Brady?  That's what I meant, right.  Unfortunately, More Than Just a Catch.  More Than Just a Catch.  Yeah.  There it is.  What'd you catch, Mr. Brady?  Oh.  I caught the old xylophone ribs.  With quote signs on the.  The catch.  Yeah.  And then, that's it. 
[03:39:00]  Shit.  Fucking beyond the catch.  What is this?  Just stop.  All right.  Let's do line of the day.  Line of the day and then get out.  You're going to be all right, Roland.  Got stuff to do.  Right?  Yeah.  Are we meeting with somebody?  It's radio.  I'm telling him it's radio.  It's radio.  And quite frankly, Eli's interview would be even worse because he's another.  Just, he has the personality of a clamshell.  Eli's personality. 
[03:39:30]  He has more personality when someone writes about him in the paper.  All right.  Why don't we do the old line of the day?  Hit it.  Here comes the line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  I've said I've been to Broadway.  It's been because I've been dragged there by some broad. 
[03:40:00]  Yeah, let me think about it.  Did I ever go to Broadway?  That's why they call it Broadway.  That's why they call it Broadway.  Wow, what a revelation.  You're absolutely right.
