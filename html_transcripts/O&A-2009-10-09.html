<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opens with a discussion of the NASA L-Cross mission to the moon, juxtaposed with the hosts' comedic complaints about Manhattan cell service.  This segues into a discussion of the Red Sox's poor playoff performance and a critical missed play by Matt Holliday, spiced with suggestive comments about a woman on television.  The bulk of the show then becomes a highly critical and offensive tirade against Barack Obama's Nobel Peace Prize, eliciting angry calls from listeners, many from St. Louis, upset about the Cardinals' loss and Albert Pujols' potential departure.

The show takes a bizarre, sexually explicit turn with a lengthy and offensive discussion of the Gay Games, fueled by increasingly outrageous calls from listeners. This is followed by analysis of a viral video showing a man defending himself against a harasser, further fight video discussion, and more offensive commentary about the Gay Games.

The next segment features a rambling discussion covering a wide range of topics.  This includes analysis of a fight video leading to comments about racial stereotypes and sucker punches; humorous high school anecdotes from callers and the hosts, including tales of an erection during a wrestling match and the "Itty Bitty Titty Committee"; discussion of the LeGarrette Blount incident; more jokes about the Gay Games; a discussion of a street scam involving sucker punches; speculation about the moon landing and the NASA moon crash; commentary on Stephen Hawking; discussion of President Obama's basketball game and its media criticism; analysis of various viral videos including "happy slapping" and "Fire in the Hole" videos; personal anecdotes from the hosts and callers; and finally a debate on bottled water and environmental concerns.  The conversation frequently uses vulgar language and veers wildly off-topic.

A subsequent segment focuses on the declining value of the dollar, leading to discussions of societal collapse, the inadequacy of the legal system's response to disasters like Hurricane Katrina, global inequality, racial issues including "black on black crime," the role of corporations like Procter & Gamble, criticism of US foreign policy, and the Obama presidency and Nobel Peace Prize. A phone interview with physicist Michio Kaku discusses the NASA moon mission, the possibility of extraterrestrial life, and string theory, punctuated by a humorous exchange about the "money shot."  Comedian Patrice O'Neal appears as a studio guest, promoting his shows, along with mention of Jim Norton's appearance on the Tonight Show.  The segment ends with a discussion of a reported suicide attempt at the DC Improv.  The broadcast heavily utilizes offensive language.

Patrice O'Neal continues as a guest in the next segment, beginning with a prank call to Michio Kaku which ends abruptly.  The hosts, along with O'Neal, engage in a highly offensive discussion of David Letterman's apology for his affair, using misogynistic language to describe his wife. O'Neal expands on his relationship philosophy using vulgar language and misogynistic terms.  The segment also details behind-the-scenes conflicts within the show's staff, particularly between Steve and E-Rock, focusing on E-Rock's posting of photos of Steve's extravagant breakfasts.  Opie's difficulties obtaining properly prepared oatmeal are also discussed.

A further segment details a conflict involving Steve, the executive producer, and other staff members, specifically Eric and Danny. Steve's alleged yelling at Eric over his unusual breakfast, including two cheeseburgers, french fries, an omelet, and chicken salad, is a major point of discussion, as is the long-standing animosity between Steve and Danny.  The segment includes numerous vulgar descriptions of the conflict and staff relationships and ends without resolution.

The final segment focuses on the ongoing conflict between Danny and Steve, portrayed as a significant source of workplace tension.  The hosts and other staff members, including Sam, Travis, and E-Rock, attempt to mediate, using various metaphors. E-Rock's role in escalating the conflict is debated, along with the need to rebuild staff morale.  Patrice's relationship advice is mentioned, and Ronnie's perspective is sought. The discussion concludes without resolution, marked by continued tension and bitter remarks, with even a mention of Fezzy's toupee. The hosts express exhaustion with their jobs.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Enough of this palaver. Let's get the show on the road.  Woo!  Oh yeah, the workhorses are here. It's Friday. We got your live programming.  Ah!  Ah!  On the day we're gonna shoot the moon.  Yes.  What the hell's that about, Anthony?  Well, apparently, uh, there's, uh, they want to see if there's water on the moon.  Really?  Yeah, so they're going, like, kind of by the south pole of the moon, and then they got this, uh, this, uh, ship, this little rocket ship. 
[00:00:30]  What's it called? The Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite.  Little L-Cross. Little L-Cross, or whatever the hell they want to call it.  And what they're doing is, uh, there's like a probe, and there's a booster rocket.  It's not like they're gonna bomb the fucking moon, like, like, with a bomb.  But they, they send the spent booster rocket into the moon at great velocity. 
[00:01:00]  Twice the speed of a bullet?  Yeah, really fucking fast.  And then when it hits, it blows out a giant crater, and a bunch of this moon shit goes flying up.  And then the probe that's following this, uh, booster rocket goes into that cloud of crap, and kind of does a little, you know, looking for water shit that it does.  And then it crashes after it sends, you know, it's sending the info back to Earth as it's going through the cloud of shit.  And then finds out if, uh, there's water. 
[00:01:30]  Oh, the fuck did we figure that out?  Uh, pretty good, though.  And if we could do that, I know it's an old gag, why can't we get cell service in midtown Manhattan?  It's, they're communicating with this fucking ship.  Right.  The whole time.  It's, it's, you know, ready to crash into the moon.  Yeah.  Yet it's sending a clear signal back to Earth.  And then the other thing is gonna go through the cloud and pick up all the particles and figure out all the shit that's flying around.  Within, like, just, it's only got, like, a couple of minutes to do that.  Tops.  Minutes. 
[00:02:00]  Yeah.  I would assume seconds.  It's, uh, hanging back, you know, a little, a little further back than the, uh, little booster rocket thing.  All from Earth, someone's just gonna play a video game today, right?  Yeah, pretty much.  Pretty much.  They've had the initial, uh, separation of the, uh, little booster rocket.  Uh-huh.  Uh, that happened, um, a few minutes ago.  It's gonna happen at 730?  Yeah.  Apparently they got that at 730.  Is, uh, is, uh, Paltalk covering it?  Is somebody in their Paltalk cam?  I don't know.  I have the NASA, NASA.gov, uh, mission page up. 
[00:02:30]  Oh, that site sucks.  So I'm gonna look and see if they have the, uh, there's no porno on that one.  Is it gonna be on TV?  Yeah, they'll probably show, like, a quick stupid news clip.  I'm a big fan of the future.  So if we get to see the future today, we should have that on one of our TVs.  The future.  The future.  Yeah, it would be nice.  They don't cover shit like that anymore.  Like, eh, they're such assholes.  They should.  This is a big one, though.  So, apparently, um, I guess the Hubble telescope is gonna be trained on it, and, uh, some telescopes 
[00:03:00]  here on Earth to get kind of a little view of it.  Will we get a cool picture?  How big's the crater?  I think they said it's gonna be about 60 feet across.  Wow.  Not all that.  You know, it's not like one of these giant fucking craters.  Right.  Yeah, about 60 feet across, and, uh, tons of shit should go into the atmosphere, not  atmosphere, into space.  What if they hit the desert of the moon?  I think they know where they're going, where they're aiming. 
[00:03:30]  How do they know for real?  Ah, they kind of, you know.  They haven't been there in a while.  They were jockeying for position, and I don't think we've ever sent anything, uh, important,  uh, to the, um, south pole of, of, uh, the moon.  Is it an educated guess that this is the best place for water?  Yeah.  And what is that based on?  The poles have always been, uh...  Their poles work like our poles?  Yeah.  A little colder.  Mm-hmm.  Than, um, than the equator.  Right.  Uh, so they kind of know, yeah, we'll send it in there. 
[00:04:00]  Like, the moon rocks they brought back from the moon during the Apollo missions were just  dust.  They didn't find anything on there, really.  No, no sign of water or anything.  Or life.  Yeah.  There's nothing.  So they're figuring, uh, maybe if they hit, uh, uh, the, the south pole, maybe that's  where there's some frozen water that's been left over there for, you know, a couple  of years, perhaps.  What a...  But, uh...  Rape.  But, uh, yeah, it's kind of a cool thing, I think.  I kind of like that. 
[00:04:30]  Very cool.  I like space shit that we're doing.  I remember sitting there watching that goddamn lunar, uh, not lunar, the, uh, the Mars rover  when that thing was just landing on Mars and they went through the... and you couldn't  even see it.  No.  It wasn't anything like that, but just mission control footage of them telling everybody  what was happening.  It was like a little dialogue and you sort of...  They showed the mission control, uh, and, uh, the people getting very excited.  It was kind of cool to watch.  I like that.  Yeah, we like that space stuff.  We've always been into that. 
[00:05:00]  So we got that going on.  Hopefully that won't fuck up the whole universe.  Yeah, that would be nice.  It just throws the moon out of orbit and, and, you know, tidal waves and...  Just throws the delicate balance of our universe off.  Yeah.  And everything just starts falling into black holes.  Wonderful.  Who the fuck knows?  Great.  Maybe we'll go somewhere better than this shithole we're on.  Well, I always get scared when they bring shit back from space.  I'm like, you don't know for sure.  Leave it up there.  The astronauts use the pen in space.  Right.  Leave that fucking disease shit up there. 
[00:05:30]  Yeah.  Don't bring a new disease here.  You ever see the Andromeda strain?  There you go.  Very scary.  It turns your blood to powder.  That's right, Charlie.  Yes.  I've seen it.  What else is going on?  Uh, thank you for turning me on to that, that play last night.  Oh, that poor bastard.  Matt Holiday.  I like playoff baseball.  I don't like watching the Cardinals and the L.A. Dodgers.  The Dodgers.  I'll watch the Phillies.  I'll watch the Red Sox.  I'll watch the Yankees. 
[00:06:00]  I was just watching that until the Sox game started, because I wanted to see that, and  oof, oof, the poor Sox.  Yeah.  They didn't look good.  The Angels beat them five-zip, right?  Yeah.  Shut them out.  A couple of real fucking, like, bum calls, though, that the Sox got, and I am the last  person that would ever be a Red Sox fan, but, uh, oh, just horrible.  That first base ump, what a blind motherfucker he is.  I didn't see it.  It was obviously, um, being plays made at first, and, uh, this guy didn't see him, and 
[00:06:30]  kind of jepped the, uh, the Sox out of some, uh, a couple of them.  Seems like it wouldn't have made a difference, really, right?  I don't know, you know.  You never know if a rally starts or whatever.  Yeah, this guy gets on first, he steals second, blah, blah, blah, blah, you know.  It just happened.  No.  That's an animation.  Oh, no, that's it.  See, right there.  No, that's like Jurassic Park dinosaurs.  What do you mean?  They're fake.  That's fake?  There's, you know, fake. 
[00:07:00]  That was an animation?  Yeah.  Oh.  It's an animation.  Wow, look at her dress today.  Wowee, wowee.  Holy shit, that's a little...  Wow.  Pretty leggy today.  Oh, I like that.  I wonder if I could call.  Anthony...  What would happen if I called?  Oh, damn, that ship has sailed.  Yeah?  I don't look that bad.  Wow, that's a short little...  That's a pretty hot dress for your ex.  That's a good one.  Look at that aunt's ex on TV, doing a little traffic report.  That dress looks good.  Wow, why are they allowing her...  It's got really the blonde hair. 
[00:07:30]  I don't know why they're allowing so much gam on her.  Because usually they're very, um, they're very touchy about that.  Well, they want...  They need ratings, probably.  Used to wrap her up.  Wow.  They need ratings.  Oh.  Yeah, yeah.  All right, time to break out the tits and ass again.  You look good there, Ant.  Oh, what do you think?  Ship sails?  Silver?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hard coming back from that one.  I bet you one phone call and it's back. 
[00:08:00]  You think?  Yeah.  Fire up the old website and get things going again.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  I bet you one lousy phone call.  I don't see that.  That's a booty call waiting to happen, my friend.  Look at everybody's going, Ant, just stop yourself.  No.  So the Red Sox, a couple bad calls, but the Angels beat them 5-0.  And then you got the Dodgers game.  Yeah.  Where what's his name there fucked up, huh?  Yeah, yeah.  Matt Holiday.  He's out there. 
[00:08:30]  Could have just made a regular catch.  I guess they were ahead 3-2 at the time.  And this would have just ended the game.  That's it.  It was it.  It's kind of a Bill Buckner thing.  You know, two out, bottom of the ninth.  It's just like over.  It's over.  Or with the top of the ninth.  Yeah, just fucking over.  Catch the ball.  It's done.  Bottom of the ninth.  And he fucking missed it.  That ship has sailed, but there's an oil spill.  Oh, geez.  We need volunteers to get the tar off the seagulls. 
[00:09:00]  Hey, you're cock blocking me.  Sorry.  I'm kidding.  I went backwards.  I can't go there.  We like to go backwards.  I can't go back there.  Yeah, so a little routine fly ball.  The guy fucked it up.  Yep, fucked it up.  And the Dodgers end up winning the game.  Opened up the chance for the Dodgers to score, and that was that.  Yeah.  Dodgers, you know, won it.  I just checked in on the score, like, at some point during the game, and I'm like, 
[00:09:30]  oh, okay, well, you know.  Mm-hmm.  I guess the Cardinals got this one wrapped up, and then what the fuck happened?  I just don't have a desire to watch the Cardinals.  Mm-mm.  Never did.  Nah.  Even with Mark McGuire when he was doing his thing.  Such like a, such a safe-looking team.  I don't know what it is about the Cardinals.  I, um, I, I'm not, I didn't sit there and really watch the game, you know.  Like, I kept tabs on what was going on, but I watched the Sox game.  That was, um, wow, the Red Sox did not look good. 
[00:10:00]  Well, it's only one game.  Even with, you know, the shitty calls that they got.  Right.  They still just, the Angels look pretty good, though.  You watch my Phillies?  They're playing for a dead guy.  Phillies lost.  Yep.  Yeah.  So that series is tied at one.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, and we see the Yankees.  Um, tonight.  Are you going tonight?  I will be attending the game this evening.  Fuck, you got your tickets.  I will be going.  Nice.  Um, supposed to be, like, nice drizzly fucking cold weather, so dress properly for that,  but, um, good seats. 
[00:10:30]  Nice.  Watch the game.  Just a, a nice, nice rainy night at the stadium.  Hope it's not a fucking rain delay.  Hate that.  I don't know.  I hate looking at a, hate looking at a tarp while you're just being rained on.  It sucks.  They always put on some good TV for you.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Watch some TV on the big screen.  Great.  Sitting in the rain, hoping the game is going to come back.  So, we got, uh, playoff baseball.  That's happening.  Uh, thank God they finally did the right thing, and they gave Obama the Nobel Peace Prize, 
[00:11:00]  Anthony.  Obama got the Nobel Peace Prize because he's doing a lot for this world.  And he's being recognized today with the Nobel Peace Prize.  They're saying Nobel?  Nobel.  Oh, Nobel.  Yes, people are calling you out.  Oh, fuck, it's early.  Uh.  You're right.  Uh, you're so right.  He, uh, is not deserving of this.  I'm sorry.  Isn't it Nobel what he's doing, though? 
[00:11:30]  No.  No.  Yeah.  They should have given him the Nobel Peace Prize.  Not the Nobel Peace Prize.  Well, then spell it Nobel.  How is it spelled?  I have no idea.  And I laugh at Voss.  It, uh, what, really?  Aside from taking, uh, the first few months of his, uh, presidency to hop in Air Force One  and smooch the bungholes of every fucking terrorist-supporting nation, uh, on the face of the earth, 
[00:12:00]  um, what has he done for peace?  He's just doing a lot of listening.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Well, he's just listening to everybody around the world.  Well, that fuzzy foreigner motherfucker that's in charge of that thing, and he has done great  things for peace.  The, the, of course they're gonna think that, cause it's, it's not, uh, American to fly  yourself all over the, uh, the world, uh, and, and, and, and apologize.  Waddle doodle. 
[00:12:30]  Guy's just going around, uh, saying I'm sorry to everybody.  That guy got him the peace prize.  What else has he done?  Well, what do you want him to do?  What?  Start wars all over the world?  No, not start wars all over the world.  What do you want him to do?  But not apologize for what we've, what we've done.  Uh, uh, uh, oh, oh, he wins the peace prize for what?  Who voted?  The fucking Guantanamo detainees?  Are they the ones that voted?  Who voted?  The fucking terrorists that have been let go?  The fucking people that can now, the terrorists that can now just sit in a prison knowing that 
[00:13:00]  they don't have to say shit because they're not going to be waterboarded?  Uh, uh, uh, I'm sure it's not the CIA agents that might be up on charges for doing their  job or the FBI agents that, uh, uh, are, are, might be brought up on charges for doing  their job, getting information that's kept the country safe for, uh, you know, eight,  eight or so years after nine 11.  But yeah, just slap him with that.  Yeah.  Break at least stupid.  Jimmy Carter got those two goddamn, the Jew and the Arab shaking hands for fuck's sake. 
[00:13:30]  Yeah.  But that didn't last long.  Well, they've been trying to get them to shake ever since.  Hey, Egypt and Israel kind of, you know, they have this kind of, uh, men's and men's thing,  you know, but, but yeah, at least he had them there.  Yeah.  And even stupid Bill Clinton with Arafat and then the other, you know, guy with Yahoo.  Who was that?  Was that the three-way handshake?  Yeah.  The three-way handshake.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Right after Bill Clinton ran out of the fucking Oval Office, he didn't even Purell his hands 
[00:14:00]  after slathering up his palm with that fucking intern juice.  Everyone's shaking with their duty hands.  Their duty hands.  Yeah, because they wipe with them.  Going back to Carter, let's not forget, he was great with the hammer.  Yeah, yeah.  He built a lot of those, uh, houses for Habitat for Humanity.  As far as hammers go, I think he was the best as far as all the, uh, the presidents.  They called Jimmy the Hammer Carter, I think.  Sure, they sure did.  Yeah.  Good wrestling name.  He could swing a fucking hammer. 
[00:14:30]  Great.  Ah.  But, uh, giving him the Nobel Peace Prize is, uh, very ridiculous.  Just for, just for spanning the globe on the apology tour.  Fucking Air Force One.  They should have painted a big sad face on the front, like, I'm sorry.  You know, they used to paint the front of fighter planes?  Oh.  Look like the teeth and the eyes.  Rah.  They should have just painted a, meh, we're sorry.  Well, we're heading toward a global society, so we gotta-  Are we?  We gotta kinda see what they're all about. 
[00:15:00]  Yeah, good.  I don't wanna be part of the global society, to be honest with you.  There you go.  That's an A-10 warthog.  That's how the plane should look.  You're not even part of a regular society.  True.  So you have nothing to worry about?  Oh, I can't stand it, though.  God, just slathering this guy's butt.  Don't worry.  Three years to go.  Yeah?  A little more than three, right?  Let's say hi to Mike in St. Louis.  He's not happy today.  Mike!  Mike!  Look, guys, I really love the show, and I wish my first call was a happier one, but, 
[00:15:30]  um, you know, I learned something last night, and that's what it feels like to be a Cubs fan.  Um, Matt Holiday, just, he comes in here and breaks everybody's hearts, man.  We didn't make it the last two years.  We're accustomed to winning here, and, um, I think we can come back.  You know, Pujol said...  This guy's all...  Oh, my God, you're losing it.  Goddammit.  Well, Mike...  I understand that.  Mike understands that's not...  That's one of those plays.  It's not just one lousy, bad play, and you lose a game. 
[00:16:00]  That's one of those...  That's a game-changer.  That's a...  I mean, a series-changer, I should say.  That could...  You know...  Cardinals are in deep trouble now.  That could be...  Tony La Russa is...  He gets a lot of, uh, hype, and everybody kisses his ass, but he's a moron.  If you look at our lead-off hitter the other day, who he says can't hit lefties, he's...  He had...  He was on base four times yesterday, and he was benched.  Tony does dumbass shit like that.  You got Smolti, who's a, you know, future Hall of Famer.  Bring him in to close, you fucking moron.  Don't put Franklin in there. 
[00:16:30]  But, look, I just want to say, like, you know, we love the baseball here.  We're just all heartbroken, and, uh...  Yeah, that has to be a tough one.  ...represent Cardinal Nation, and I want to say that, uh, please, Phillies or Rockies,  beat the living fuck out of the Dodgers.  Please do it.  You're giving up already!  Wow.  You know what, dude?  I'm throwing in the towel.  Oh, shit!  They don't want to spend any goddamn money.  I'm telling you what, Pujols is probably going to be wearing pinstripes in a few years,  and it's going to destroy everyone here.  I mean, that's going to make the Rams the best ball team in town, and then we'll all 
[00:17:00]  be fucked.  Wow, this guy knows his St. Louis sports, huh?  Yeah, he loves his St. Louis.  So you really think that play was a series changer, huh?  You know, honestly, like I said, I wish we could battle back.  I'm actually going to...  I bought tickets for games one and two, thinking, like, oh, good, it's going to be at home.  I get to see, you know, Carp and Wainwright, you know, one of the best one-two punches  since probably, what, Koufax and Drysdale, well, that may be stretching it a little bit,  but, you know, they've got a lot of room to grow, but so now it's basically turning 
[00:17:30]  into me going to see an elimination game, or, you know, game four, but I just hope that  I'm going to go, I'm going to have a great time, my first playoff game, and, you know,  you guys don't know how lucky you are in New York.  Got all these basketball, you know, I mean, just everything, you know, I mean, we only have  very limited stuff here, and it's, you know, all we have is the Cardinals, man.  That was a wind out of the sails game last night.  Yeah, you guys had the wind, it was just, you had it, when you still saw that ball being  launched, it was like, yeah, Billy Buckner is one of those, it was, it was just, here 
[00:18:00]  it is, crack, there it is, all right, game over, they won, holy shit, oh, no, he dropped  it, oh, no, I love the show, and, you know, talking to you guys, the only thing in the  world that can cheer me up.  All right, Mikey, hang in there, all right?  You never know, you never know.  You never know.  Take it easy.  All right.  He's giving up, though, it's, what, the series tied at one, right?  Yeah, come on, I'm like, no, oh, is this the play?  This is great.  Crack, here it is.  And they're just kind of looking like, ah, oh, oh, what a shame. 
[00:18:30]  No, that puts the Dodgers up two games to zero, right.  You know, that's what you get for trying to make a bucket catch.  He was trying to be fancy, and he couldn't just make a regular catch.  I hate that shit.  I hate that fucking fancy shit.  Yeah, but what do you expect from a right fielder?  The spinning fucking shortstop is another thing that you really don't have to do.  Sometimes you have to do it.  But the old, you know, I'm going to catch, spin around, and throw to first, and sometimes 
[00:19:00]  you see the ball just sail into the crowd.  You're like, what the fuck are you doing?  The runner's still 45 feet away.  Yeah, you could have stopped, planted yourself, and thrown the fucking ball.  Just stop it.  There you go.  Let's say hi to Chris in the Poconos.  Chris.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Hey, man.  You might like to know that Obama was nominated for the Peace Prize only two weeks into his  presidency.  Oh, yeah?  How about that?  Well, he was already apologizing.  He was already apologizing. 
[00:19:30]  The guy couldn't get on that plane fast enough.  Flying around.  I'm sorry.  We're sorry for the past eight years.  We've been so bad.  Let me bow to this fucking guy.  Let me kiss this guy's ass.  Let me fucking talk to some Chinese guys who have the worst fucking human rights record  on the face of the fucking earth.  But, you know, we'll kiss their fucking ass because we do business with them, and they  own more of our money than we do. 
[00:20:00]  Why does this make you so angry?  Ah, here we go.  Let's go to Kevin in Ohio.  The sports cities are starting to fight.  What's up, Kevin?  Yeah, I want to say fuck you, that baby from St. Louis.  I live 48 years old, live in Cleveland.  Ain't never seen a championship.  That top sucker can go to hell.  You got LeBron and Shaq, though.  They're going to make a run for it this year, my buddy there.  Yeah, we live in Cleveland.  We'll see.  Ain't nobody open, and we're open, but you never know. 
[00:20:30]  I have this excitement up there.  I saw the press conference when, I think it was the mayor of your fine city, gave Shaq  a snow shovel to get him ready for the harsh winter.  Yeah, that's great.  Yeah, we get up here a snow shovel.  You're looking at a dome in St. Louis, got two champions going there.  No.  Yeah, where do you think that snow shovel is right now?  You think Shaq still has it?  Yeah, he's still got it.  Yeah, he's saving it.  Hey, did you see More Than a Game? 
[00:21:00]  What's that?  Did you see the LeBron James movie, More Than a Game?  No, I haven't seen it.  Fuck you.  I've got a truck, man.  I'm out here.  All right.  Trying to survive.  Patrice is coming in today.  Maybe I'll talk to him about it.  Is he?  Thank you, Kevin.  Thank you.  All right.  Let me say hi to Tom in St. Louis.  Tom.  Yeah.  That last idiot from St. Louis doesn't know what the hell he's talking about.  Thinking that Pujols is going to be in pinstripes?  What the hell? 
[00:21:30]  That just doesn't make any sense.  What the hell?  What the?  I don't know.  I don't know what the fuck he's going to do.  I don't either.  Why is it?  All they're saying around St. Louis is that he's going to take a pay cut to be able to  stay in St. Louis, and the dumbass said, bring in John Smoltz, and John Smoltz has  done nothing but pitch like a bitch ever since he's been in St. Louis, and then he says  the Rams are going to be the number one team in baseball, number one team in St. Louis.  Opie, you're a hockey fan. 
[00:22:00]  Look at the Blues.  Yeah, no kidding.  We're Pittsburgh from three years ago.  No kidding.  No kidding.  You know, I think we can do sports radio.  This is easy.  Yeah, you just kind of talk.  You can take a lot of calls.  They know a lot of stuff, and then you go, yep, absolutely.  And you go, no kidding.  Yeah.  You just say, no kidding a lot.  No kidding.  Well, you know, somebody else has another opinion.  Sports radio.  Yeah, it's great.  I hate sports radio.  I could listen for maybe a half hour.  Yeah.  And you get everything you need, and then it's enough.  Yeah, then that's it. 
[00:22:30]  Hey, Tom, thank you, man.  Thank you.  All right.  Oh, cool.  I'm watching that booster rocket thing.  It looks like it's twirling around.  T minus one hour and counting.  Thank you, Kevin from Connecticut.  Less than an hour, right?  How do they keep a frigging beat on that thing?  Jesus.  Hey, here we go.  Let's say hi to Roach.  Roach, what's up?  Not much.  The main problem I have with Obama when getting the Nobel Peace Prize is the fact that we're  involved in two wars. 
[00:23:00]  How can you get the Nobel Peace Prize and be involved in two wars?  Well, it wasn't his wars, man.  You know, it was the Bush wars, man.  No, it's not that.  He's the president of the United States.  Yeah, he is commander in chief, who, by the way, isn't even listening to the guys on the  ground in Afghanistan.  This war, and I'm not talking about the Iraq war.  I do not really agree with the Iraq war, the reasons that we went in, all that. 
[00:23:30]  I mean, that's ancient history as far as Bush bamboozling everybody as to why we went there.  Very questionable.  Yeah, I feel sorry for that.  I think the majority understands that now, right?  Yeah.  I feel sorry for the soldiers that are over there because why sacrifice your life to try  to get democracy over there?  But the Afghanistan war has taken like a backseat to the Iraqi war up until now when people are  noticing, oh, shit, there's a lot of people dying over there now. 
[00:24:00]  The Taliban is kind of making a little comeback.  And the commanders on the ground over there are saying, look, we need more troops.  And Washington is completely politicizing the war.  And when that happens, it's like Vietnam.  You get public opinion gets in there. 
[00:24:30]  You get partisan fighting whether we should send in.  And then Obama has preached so much about pulling troops out and getting everybody back here that  he can't look like he's giving in by sending more troops.  And meanwhile, they need more fucking troops.  Either pull everyone the fuck out and bring everyone home and let the place just go to  shit or go all in or go all in.  Give the fucking commanders the troops they're asking for because they know better than some 
[00:25:00]  shithead in a suit sitting in Congress or the president what needs to be done over there.  And these guys are shorthanded.  They're ill-equipped.  And they can't get the job done with what they have right now.  They're doing an amazing job only because they're, you know, one of the best trained  military in the world.  The American soldier is fucking amazing.  The equipment we have is amazing. 
[00:25:30]  The people is fantastic.  And they're not giving them what they need.  And the commanders are the guy that's fucking telling them, look, we're here.  Hello.  You hear the fucking bombs?  You hear that?  We need this.  Give it to them.  In my opinion, the Afghanistan war is an unwinnable war.  The only way you can win that war is through genocide.  Mm-hmm.  Good.  Then wipe them the fuck out. 
[00:26:00]  Good.  But they have families.  Ah, fuck them.  They need, uh, they, it's, I'm just saying, it's one or the other, dude.  It's, it's, realize it's unwinnable and, and get the fuck out of there and let the place  crumble and hope, hope to God that, uh, uh, the Taliban doesn't decide to make it another  Al-Qaeda training, uh, country, uh, where they could then hit us.  They have a base of operations to hit us again from.  We could occasionally lob some cruise missiles in there every so often. 
[00:26:30]  But, uh, you know, if, if we are fighting a war and, uh, the commanders are asking for  more, uh, troops and equipment, then you fucking give it to them.  Thank you.  Ah, I don't, I don't know how else to put it.  Thank you, Roach.  One or the other.  Yeah.  Have a good day.  Thank you, sir.  Let me say hi to Tom and Erie.  Erie's a wonderful place.  Hey, Anthony, right on, man.  I agree with what you just said.  That, that, Cleveland, I'm a Steeler fan.  That fucking city, they, they, what they did is they took out a $700 million bond and they 
[00:27:00]  went after the gay games and they got them.  So that's the only fucking victory that's ever happened in Cleveland.  Yeah, we're gay, gay.  I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not  Bullshit.  Look up there.  That fucking Cleveland Browns, they ought to fucking have it at Cleveland Browns Stadium  is where they ought to have it.  Fucking Thomas Browns.  Thomas Browns.  Thomas Wright, this hit a few days ago.  We haven't talked about it yet, but, uh, congratulations to the city of Cleveland.  Yeah.  They got the gay games.  Big congrats. 
[00:27:30]  That's good.  What, what do they have?  The javelin catch?  Hey, what city got the foot fetish games?  I just need to know.  I don't understand that.  So based on your sexuality, they have a whole fucking sporting event?  It's great.  You should see the pole.  That's bizarre to me.  They have a pole vaulting where the guy can juggle at the same time that he's pole vaulting.  Yeah.  It's amazing.  I don't get that sexual stuff.  Like, like the, the gay pride parade, the gay, the gay Olympics. 
[00:28:00]  The gay games.  What is that?  Based on your sexuality.  That's so fucked up to me.  Oh, no.  Look at that fucking advertising.  They're swimming.  And they're, oh, the gay games.  Dude, what are the, what are some of the games?  What is this about?  I've never heard of the gay games.  And go.  Here's the official song.  This is the opening number.  Yeah.  Woo.  Woo.  Yeah. 
[00:28:30]  The lighting of the torch is interesting, too.  This is some guy just laying on his belly and they plant the torch in his butt.  Fucking.  The gay games.  Oh, poor Cleveland.  Cleveland has suffered enough.  Stop.  Yes.  Leave them alone.  Leave Cleveland alone.  Federation of Gay Games.  Participation, inclusion, personal best.  That's their slogan.  Wow.  Register now. 
[00:29:00]  Oh, come on.  Look at the fucking, look at the first video they got to put on there.  Some guy stretching on a mat.  Not a guy named Matt.  No.  It's a cushy mat.  And he's got his butt in the air.  Well, he's getting ready, man.  He's stretching.  He certainly is.  He doesn't want to pull a muscle.  He's stretching.  He doesn't want to pull a hammy.  Oh, that's great.  Who was the last year's gold medalist in docking? 
[00:29:30]  Who was that?  I forgot.  Name.  Oh, I can't remember.  Jesus.  The longest prolapsed asshole.  Is that a competition?  I think it is.  See how long you can hang that thing down?  Look how immature we are.  Yes.  So dumb.  Yeah, but Cleveland has suffered enough.  Poor Cleveland.  They got that to look forward to.  Rio's got the real Olympics and Cleveland's got the gay Olympics.  Gay Olympics.  Well, they won that one.  That's good. 
[00:30:00]  Ah, bad.  Oh, I didn't know this, Anthony.  Dr. X has more info on the gay games.  Dr. X, what do you got?  Oh, it's a beautiful opening ceremony.  They unfurl the flag.  Five brown rings.  Oh, are they all?  Oh, my God.  Well, let's go to Lenny in Jersey.  We all get to be 12 years old again.  Lenny, what do you got?  We got the muff dive.  And Anthony would probably like that one.  Ah, well, the ladies will be participating in muff diving. 
[00:30:30]  Yes.  Very good.  They have dance sport.  Darts.  That's interesting.  That's a very good question.  Let's see where the bullseye is and what the dart is.  Fucking Tom.  Flesh darts.  Fucking Tom has a very good question.  For real.  Tom in Chicago.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey, man.  Hey, I wanted to know how exactly, like, the registration process goes.  You, like, fill out the registration form and then you got to go fuck a guy in the ass to make sure that you're gay?  Oh, God.  Yeah, how do you prove you're fucking...  Is it kind of like the steroid thing where, like, you're gay?  They just know. 
[00:31:00]  They just know, you think?  I'm sure they know.  Well, who would...  What straight guy would want to fake that he's gay to be in the Gay Olympics?  I guess it's pretty safe to say that all participants are gay.  You want some gold medals.  Here's a picture of my son.  Here, here.  He's, uh, gay.  He's in the, uh, you know, Gay Olympics.  Very proud of the young boy, Johnny.  He won the gold medal.  Gay Olympic.  Here's the boy.  Sucking that man's cat. 
[00:31:30]  He loves the cat.  Uh, Popper and Reno's right.  I understand this, but let me tell you something.  Because he says, uh, Jeter is a fag and more guilty of the jump throw thing than anybody.  Wait a minute.  We're still talking about the Gay Olympics.  I know.  I just saw that for a second.  Steve on Long Island.  Steve.  Good evening.  Hey, Steve.  Ah.  I believe one of the games you gentlemen forgot in the Gay Olympics is called Match the Hatch. 
[00:32:00]  Ah.  You bunch of fags.  Match the Hatch.  You know what?  And, uh, that brings me to this.  Trot flu.  Day eight.  That's a tough one.  I'm having a tough time waking up this morning.  Damn.  And I'm still fucking blowing out snot.  Thank you, Bob Kelly.  Preparation H is a sponsor?  For real?  For, uh, the Gay Games?  For real?  Or is that a joke?  Of course not.  I don't know.  Sometimes it works out that way.  It's for hurting buttock.  Ah.  Uh, well, this is a very good question coming in from Ziggy in D.C. 
[00:32:30]  Ziggy.  Morning, boys.  Good morning, Ziggy.  I was just wondering with the upcoming Gay Games, is, uh, Steve taking time off going  to be a problem again?  Ah.  Ah, that's right.  Uh, Steve's gonna have to have some time off to make his way as a-  We might have to have an-  Correspondent.  We might have to have an intervention with Steve.  Yes.  I make my silly little videos, right?  And people don't really pay attention to the videos when Steve shows up.  Like, Steve shows up in the background of a lot of my videos.  Indeed.  And one guy said, holy shit, Steve's belly's getting so big, it's bending his spine. 
[00:33:00]  Holy shit.  What a great comment.  Oof.  But you know what?  If you really look closely at Steve, he's gained a lot of weight back.  Gee.  And I thought he was on some kind of, like, magical diet.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And I know E-Rock-  So you're thinking intervention.  We ought to-  Yeah.  I know E-Rock tweets his breakfast every morning, and yesterday, if E-Rock's around, Steve was  eating a huge Tupperware filled with French fries. 
[00:33:30]  And what was it, Lazada?  It was three Tupperwares.  Three Tupperwares.  No, I know.  I was just describing the first one, Danny.  That's the beauty of this.  Three Tupperwares.  Here comes E-Rock, because he took the picture, because I don't want to misrepresent this.  It was French fries in one Tupperware, some kind of pasta dish in the other, or pizza,  I'm not sure.  Here comes E-Rock.  And then we'll go back to the phone.  E-Rock, you tweet Steve's breakfast every morning, right?  Yeah, almost every morning.  And what was yesterday?  Oh, my God.  Is this yesterday?  This is what he had yesterday. 
[00:34:00]  In the lower right on this photo here, I guess it's an omelet.  That's an omelet.  I wasn't 100% sure.  I wasn't 100% sure.  There's ketchup on it.  It's half eaten.  Or it's pasta.  It's one of the two.  Yeah, I can't really tell.  It looks like ketchup on it.  He has a plate of French fries.  Yeah, a big Tupperware of French fries.  And then what appeared to be just huge chunks of chicken and lettuce with blue cheese dressing.  With a giant package of blue cheese dressing to squeeze all over it.  But if you eat all that, that's way too many calories. 
[00:34:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I don't care what diet you're on.  That's too many calories.  Yeah.  There's been mornings where he hides a little tub that had like two cheeseburgers in it.  You would have to, if you want to eat that for breakfast, the rest of the day you have  to just walk around fucking curling giant weights, walking down the hallway.  You're just constantly working out.  You ever take a peek at men's health?  No.  That's a good magazine if you work out and you're trying to eat right and stuff.  And they guilt you. 
[00:35:00]  It's the official magazine, by the way, of the gay limp.  Oh, don't even stop it.  Maybe we can find one.  But they show like if you eat a, let's say you eat a cheeseburger, then it shows you  what you have to do to burn off that just lousy cheeseburger because you felt like having  a cheeseburger.  Crazy, right?  Yeah.  It's the equivalent of jumping rope for the next month.  Month.  No joke.  If we can maybe find a men's health, they do a little.  It's probably online too, but there's no way he's, that is keeping his weight down. 
[00:35:30]  Oh, there's the two cheeseburgers.  There's the two cheeseburgers.  Look at the bites taken out of it.  It looks like it's been mauled.  Literally mauled.  Yeah.  It looks like it's just being ripped apart.  Like that, the bite marks look like, yeah.  You could tell that was, I don't know.  If that was, if you gave that to, you know, some kind of CSI, they would tell you a lot  about the person.  Yeah.  The bite pattern.  I've asked him about that too.  And he says, oh, well, this was leftover from yesterday. 
[00:36:00]  I'm like, but it doesn't mean that it's breakfast.  I don't think that's from the bite marks.  I don't think that's the executive producer.  I think we got another executive producer out there with a bite radius about this big.  We could cut it open and see if cheeseburgers fall out.  Look, I'm not going to cut open that executive producer and watch those cheeseburgers spill out  all over the studio.  I'm way in with that one, Ed.  Way in.  Ooh. 
[00:36:30]  Ooh.  I have to turn off my little dingy text.  Ding.  Thank you, E-Rock.  So follow E-Rock, E-Rock Radio, if you want to see what Steve's eating every morning.  It's pretty amazing.  Let's go to Penis Wrinkle.  Penis Wrinkle, what's going on?  Yeah.  Hey.  I love how I have to, like, talk to these guys like that.  Yeah, yeah.  Real serious names.  Hello, Penis Wrinkle.  How's the family?  Yeah, great.  How about yours?  Pretty good, sir.  I hear that they are not having fencing.  They're having sword fighting at the Gay Olympics.  Oh, shit. 
[00:37:00]  Sword fighting instead of fencing, I get it, with their weenies.  Does anyone actually sword fight?  I don't know.  You'd feel pretty silly.  Do they guys actually sword fight?  I think that's, like, you know, foreplay.  Do a little sword fighting, you giggle.  Oh, this is a very good question coming in from...  It's raining, man.  Robin.  Hi, guys.  In Detroit.  Is it cold in the D yet?  Kind of brought it up.  It's getting there.  It's getting there.  Yeah.  I'm kind of excited about the Gay Olympics, because I think the jousting and the pole 
[00:37:30]  vaulting are going to be fun, but I'm almost sure that tax fighting is illegal in Cleveland.  Oh, no.  So there can't be any sword fight.  Thank you, Danny.  Oh, my God.  Jesus Christ.  Is that the proper form?  They're holding the backs of each other's heads as their foreheads are touching together.  What is that accomplishing, really?  They're pushing their pelvises together, and they're completely engorged, and these two 
[00:38:00]  gentlemen have crossed the swords.  They're making an X.  I am the master.  They can have a good saying, too.  Yeah?  What?  What?  What?  What?  They're holding the back.  What happened to Robin?  I don't know.  Let's go to, it's kind of, we're doing like an open phones Friday right now.  Yeah.  We just make up bits as we go along here.  Why not?  Dave and PA, how are you, Dave?  Go fucking Kane!  Go fucking Kane! 
[00:38:30]  You know, all this shit, man, about baseball and bags, I'm starting to think I'm listening  out to you.  What you guys need to talk about is...  Hello?  Where'd he go?  For real?  It just disappeared.  What's he doing, was he trying to get us?  That can't be an actual poster for the Gay Games, is it?  Sports and Cultural Festival.  This is from Chicago 2006?  Yeah, I mean, it's from GayGameChicago.org. 
[00:39:00]  This is, there is a gay porno on that.  Yeah.  This is the weirdest thing ever.  I didn't know Wanda Sykes was a baton runner.  Yeah, I know.  It looks just like Wanda Sykes.  It's like, oh, the baton runners, the guys, anyway, have to hold it in their mouth.  I know what you're going to say.  Oh, mouth?  And they pass it off.  Yeah, well, mouth to ass.  Yeah, I was thinking mouth to ass.  Is usually how they pass those off.  You start with it in your mouth, and then you pass it on to the next fella by sticking  it in his hiney.  Of course.  Kevin from...  Go fucking Kane! 
[00:39:30]  Kevin from Connecticut wants to know if there'll be a biathlon.  For those that are a little curious.  Chris of the Pocono is very confused.  Open phones Friday here.  Yes, Chris?  Yeah, I just got to say it the obvious.  What does the world come to when E-Rock is making fun of Steve's breakfast?  Wow.  I got to tell you, man.  E-Rock looks like he's fat, but he's not fat.  That's the weird thing about E-Rock.  That's what happened.  That's what's so confusing about E-Rock. 
[00:40:00]  He looks fat, but he's not fat.  You got to put a dime next to him so you can get the scale.  If you just take a picture of E-Rock, you see, he looks fat.  I think he's just cursed with bad genetics, E-Rock.  Yeah.  Because he's not actually a fat guy.  No.  But he looks like he's fat.  You know what E-Rock is?  It's really confusing.  He looks like a little cherubish kid.  Sure, yeah.  That's what he is.  It looks like he's still working off baby fat.  That's what it is. 
[00:40:30]  Pillow biting, did we do that joke?  Oh, I think we did.  Let's say hi to Scott.  Scott, what do you got?  Guys, I just want to let you know, I just read the press release.  Remember how in the games a few years ago they had Muhammad Ali present the flame?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Well, in your own studio, Steve C. is going to be presenting the flame.  And what's going to happen?  He's just going to stand in the torch as the flame.  Oh, you know what?  All because of his flaming clothing that he wears.  Yes, indeed.  And he's a queer.  All right, get out of here. 
[00:41:00]  Greg in D.C.  Fucking good.  Good morning, boys.  I thought Anthony and the NRA would be all over the Gay Olympics because the number  one sport is bear hunting.  Oh, bear hunting.  At the Gay Olympics.  Ah.  What the fuck?  Is there going to be a beard rubbing competition where they just rub their beards together?  Their faces together?  What the fuck?  The listeners woke up.  They're ready to do radio today.  Beard.  Any time you boys talk gay in the morning, we all wake up. 
[00:41:30]  You're right there, aren't you?  Jason Columbus.  What's up, Jason?  Good evening.  Hey.  Good morning, boys.  All right.  Now, instead of curling, are they going to do scissoring?  Instead of curling, it's scissoring?  All right.  Scissoring.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, girls love doing that scissor thing.  Do they really love doing the scissor thing?  That's all they got.  I think half the shit is all myths.  They don't have any cocks.  Do gay guys really like docking?  For real?  I don't really think they do. 
[00:42:00]  I think that's a stereotype.  Do gay women love scissoring?  Yeah, I think it's...  Wouldn't they just use their tongues, get right down to it?  Why would you waste your time with scissoring?  Yeah, why would you do...  I think it...  Does it feel good on a girl when they just scissor like that?  Push.  They're just pushing their mounds.  Their mounds.  Their mounds?  Their labia majora.  And the mounds. 
[00:42:30]  Just pushing those together and look silly.  They're just rubbing their bald eagles together.  Oh, they look silly.  God damn.  Well, let me say hi to Sean in North Carolina.  He's got a very good question.  Sean.  I just wonder how long the 400-meter dash is going to take,  especially if the lead runner keeps blowing up or something.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I'm so sorry.  I'm so sorry.  See?  Get it?  Yeah, I get it.  Yeah.  I think that's an ass-fucking joke. 
[00:43:00]  Yeah, I think it was.  There you go.  Yes, it was.  These guys, I don't know what it is.  They're making me laugh hard today.  Scott the Trucker.  Scott.  Hey, after you all send Sam over there to the furry convention,  y'all need to send that little twink up to Cleveland.  Sam?  Ah.  Sam should definitely do a report from the Gay Olympics.  Yeah.  A little what's the haps.  What's the haps from there?  I think you're right.  Oh, would he be loved?  Maybe she took that candy out of his head, too. 
[00:43:30]  Ling my love me.  Oh, I like the candy bit.  We should bring that one back.  We're convinced that Sam has candy in his head.  We're very convinced of that.  The fucking wrestling.  They actually have wrestling.  The wrestling must just take forever.  The ref's probably constantly just blowing a whistle.  Well, who's whistle?  No, it's just like, all right, stop it.  It's just.  All right.  Go.  Stop it.  Wrestling at the Gay Olympics has to be just real life porn. 
[00:44:00]  Yeah.  It's got to be porn for everybody that's watching that.  Picture being able to wrestle with a chick.  That's exactly what it would be.  Like a hot, well-built chick.  Right.  Where you're rolling around on a mat and able to touch her tits  and grab between the legs and shit like that.  You'd be, that would be very sexual.  Is that a real picture?  Got a great picture of a guy looking like he is absolutely raping somebody.  Wow.  I never understood the wrestling thing. 
[00:44:30]  No.  Very, very.  I know you guys are out there and you'll yell and scream.  It's a sport and all that.  And good for you.  But I don't know, man.  Yeah.  Yeah, that doesn't.  You ever have to wrestle in school at?  I had to wrestle.  Once I had to wrestle in gym class.  And this big dopey wrestling guy that was good at wrestling grabbed me  because I had the bottom position where I was on all fours.  That's so gay.  And he's got my arm and he's got his other arm around my waist. 
[00:45:00]  You know how they do that?  Right.  And then the whistle to start the fucking competition.  And this guy grabbed me between my fucking legs.  Pretty much grabbed my scrote.  Oh, God, Danny.  Gay wrestling.  Jesus, Danny.  Nude guys.  Travis fucking found that one.  Travis found it from his personal collection.  Grabbed me between the fucking legs and lifted me up to turn me over.  Like, but by my balls. 
[00:45:30]  So I was just like, ow!  Yeah, to be a good wrestler, you've got to be willing to grab cock.  And you've got to be able to take a cock grabbing.  Yeah, you've got to be willing to grab cock.  And not even cock, dude.  Balls.  Which, like, to me, being lifted up, my body weight, even as a kid,  being lifted up by my nutsack, fucking hurt.  Of course it did.  I don't know how these wrestlers, they show them grabbing between their legs  and flipping them over.  Like, I don't care if you're wearing a cup or something like that.  It's going to hurt your balls. 
[00:46:00]  Oh, God.  Damn, Danny.  Oh, Jesus.  Do we really need?  Completely nude wrestling.  That's the way they did it.  Greco-Roman-style wrestle.  I don't have time to go through all these phone calls,  so really quick, Chad in Jersey wants to know if they're doing AIDS dodging.  As we look at a guy, his ball sack is in another wrestler's face.  This wrestler has the giant, as huge as bulge, 
[00:46:30]  and he's planted it firmly right on the guy's face.  He's got a beanbag on his face.  How do you do that and go, this is great?  This is a great sport.  I hope my dad's proud.  God bless the wrestlers out there.  They do it.  And they would yell and scream.  That it's a sport.  I'm not going to argue with those guys.  They want to win a medal for that.  Yeah.  They want to be the best at that.  Yeah.  You're the best around.  Nothing.  Did you see the Master Poe video yet? 
[00:47:00]  Somebody on Twitter.  God bless you.  I meant to retweet it last night, but I got tired.  It's becoming one of the hottest videos on YouTube.  There's some kind of punk, like, just harassing this guy.  He's at his front door.  I guess this guy lives across the street from a school.  And I don't know the back story.  I can find it in seconds if you go to YouTube.  And the guy's getting in his face, like, doing that whole, like, he's, you know, he's, like,  trying to get this guy to fight him. 
[00:47:30]  And the guy's just at his front door with his arms.  Oh, I saw that this morning.  Yeah, I know where that is.  And the guy's at the front door with his arms just crossed, like, not moving.  And the guy's really trying to get him agitated.  And he wants to fight the guy.  Yeah.  And the guy's not moving, not moving.  And then finally, the punk goes too far.  All of a sudden, the guy calmly walks forward in this karate position, gives him one fucking  chop to the neck.  The guy goes down and starts crying like a bitch.  You got to see this video.  It's pretty much everywhere today. 
[00:48:00]  This goes on for a while.  It goes on for a while.  Maybe you can fast forward.  Just give Anthony the, uh, and describe what's going on here.  Well, there is a punk right in this guy's face.  Right.  And he's at his front door or something.  The guy sort of looks like a chubby Master Poe.  Yeah.  Very calm.  He's in the position where he's got his hands folded in front of him, just standing there.  Yep.  I guess he's prepared.  He pushed him away.  He definitely is taking his time.  Now, he's not, uh... 
[00:48:30]  All right, now watch.  He walks out from his front door.  Now he's dedicated to fight.  Look at the karate position.  Watch this.  One shot.  One shot.  One shot.  And then walks just calmly toward the guy in a karate pose.  Ah, you've been pwned.  And just fucking took care of the situation.  One lousy hit from this guy. 
[00:49:00]  And now the guy's just staggering away.  It has to go back across the street, back to his friends.  And then some guy just calmly closes the front gate of this guy's house.  It's worth checking out for yourself during the commercial break.  I was watching some good fights.  How do they find that, Danny?  Well, as of right now, anyway, it's the top video on a site called vidmax.com.  Vidmax?  What's Vidmax all about?  They just have funny videos and interesting viral video sites.  Yeah, I mean, there's millions of these things now.  Yeah, no, I understand that.  Honestly, I just never heard of Vidmax. 
[00:49:30]  I thought it might be...  It's kind of like a break.  Kind of like a break.com.  Break!  Yeah.  All right.  I was watching some fight videos last night.  Yeah.  I saw this one guy.  I don't know why he was in this neighborhood, but it was a white guy.  Gets out of his truck, and seven black guys are all over him.  And this guy just completely holds his own.  Again, seven black guys.  What site was that on?  Like, impossible.com, I think?  No, it was...  But the guy did. 
[00:50:00]  He was swinging.  He held his own.  And he completely gets sucker punched at one point.  I don't like that whole gang mentality, like with white people fighting black people.  Like, the black guys are always blindsiding.  They love that blindside punch.  They come flying out of nowhere and go, woo!  No, they're saying it.  And white guys fight fairly?  Is that what you're getting at?  No, no, no.  I'm not saying that.  I'm just saying from a lot of the videos I've watched. 
[00:50:30]  I think everyone's sucker punched if you get a chance.  Yeah, but there's like...  It's always more than just one-on-one.  Like, some guy's got to fly in and just nail him in the face.  It's like, come on.  Just let the two guys fight.  That rarely happens these days, where you let the two guys just square off.  Everyone has to jump in.  Yeah, yeah, this is it.  Look at him go.  This motherfucker is...  He's on the ground now, getting kicked.  And he kind of gets out of it. 
[00:51:00]  And what?  Does he knock these guys out?  No, he just...  He doesn't get his ass handed to him.  And that was it?  There's seven guys.  No, no, he gets attacked again.  He gets blindsided.  Look, see, one guy comes flying around the truck from the other side.  Look at this fucking...  What a cocksucker, man.  You know?  And then they're all on top of him again.  But he's able to get out of it and actually hold him back a little bit.  Like, they don't want to take him on one-on-one.  Now, is he a cocksucker because he was black? 
[00:51:30]  Like, if it was a black guy and seven white guys and one of the white guys sucker punched a black guy...  Let me tell you something.  Would you be saying the same thing?  Let me tell you something.  For real.  I watch a lot of fucking videos.  Yeah.  It's usually the black guy coming and flying in the side and sucker punching.  Yeah.  I'm just saying.  It's usually what I see.  All right.  I've been sucker punched a couple of times.  And just coincidentally, I'm not making any statements here.  But it has been by black gentlemen.  Yeah.  A lot of these videos, a lot of things, a lot of stories. 
[00:52:00]  There's usually the sucker punch that comes in.  It's very, it's the blind side.  You're dealing one-on-one maybe with some other guy.  Yeah.  And then his buddy decides, ah, I'm just going to punch him in the side of the face.  It's definitely the mentality also of the big, dumb, like, guinea club guy.  Hey, hi.  And all his buddies come in and blindside.  I can see that happening too.  Believe me.  I've seen that happen a lot.  But, I don't know, black guys love just doing that blindside punch. 
[00:52:30]  Let's go to Brian in Atlanta.  It's Open Phones Friday, I guess, right?  We made that up.  Steve from Bayshore.  Of course.  I just got to give him a little take.  I didn't understand.  I tweeted that I saw more than a game.  And then he wrote me, and I don't even understand what he was getting at.  Really?  Maybe he's drunk.  I don't know.  He says he doesn't want to acknowledge that LeBron James goes by LeBron or something.  Really?  I didn't get it, Steve. 
[00:53:00]  Really?  Brian, what do you got?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Well, I wrestled in high school as well.  And I was on the JV team, wasn't that good?  And one of my buddies, Pete, he had to wrestle a girl from our neighboring school.  I love how you had to.  You said he had to.  Had to.  Had to.  That's a pleasure, my friend.  Yeah.  Okay, okay.  He had the pleasure, you should have said.  She wasn't all that attractive.  Okay, then he had to.  Little rolly. 
[00:53:30]  She wore the singlet and everything and wasn't too nice.  But anyway, she had the wrestler, and he did.  He popped a boner while he was wrestling her.  But don't you have a cup?  No, no cup.  No cup.  Okay.  And he popped a boner.  Little boner, man.  Smallest thing we've ever seen.  We called the Millimeter Peter for the rest of the senior year and just kind of ragged  on him for the whole senior year.  It was hysterical.  Millimeter Peter.  What the fuck? 
[00:54:00]  Of course.  Jesus Christ.  You didn't have a Millimeter Peter in your high school growing up?  Children.  Let's go to Dave in Nova Scotia.  We had the Itty Bitty Titty Committee, though.  Of course we did.  Itsy Bitsy, wasn't it?  I don't know.  Or itty Bitsy.  Yeah, whatever.  Our section, yeah, our chapter was the Itty Bitty Titty Committee, Opie.  That was our chapter.  The best part about that, like, all the girls were itty bitty.  They were in junior high school.  What did you expect from the girls?  But it was either flat-chested completely, or they had the little nubs, or they were girls 
[00:54:30]  that, like, developed.  Didn't you make a list?  I liked some tits.  And show each other at the lunch table, I'm making the Itty Bitty Titty Committee list.  Yeah, here it is.  You got a name you want to add to it?  This is what I got so far.  I mean, a couple of friends would sit there, and, all right, Pam.  Pam is the president.  We'll put her on there.  I like to think I was cool in high school, but the reality is I was a fucking nerd.  President of the Itty Bitty Titty Committee.  Yeah, I was a nerd.  I was a nerd. 
[00:55:00]  This is how I define myself in high school.  I was a nerd that didn't want to be a nerd.  Other nerds were fine with it.  Yeah, I'm a nerd.  What the fuck you want from me?  A nerd.  I wanted to be cool.  Yeah, well...  But I was a nerd.  It was easier once, you know, the sense of humor got in there.  Then I was just, like, joke guy.  So that was cool.  Yeah.  But, yeah, being cool guy or jock guy, yeah, wasn't going to happen.  I wanted to be, yeah, cool guy. 
[00:55:30]  I was smoke pot guy in an army jacket.  I was a jock, but I didn't want to be jock guy.  Jock guy.  Because those guys I knew from an early age had no personalities for the most part.  For the most part.  Cool guy did, though.  Nice picture, Danny.  Danny.  You're not cool guy.  No, I was totally cool guy.  What are you talking about?  Danny was trying to be cool guy.  Danny's hair is like...  You creep me out.  You look so much like...  Blonde.  One of my first interns ever. 
[00:56:00]  Anthony knows him, too.  Oh, yeah.  Doug Yule.  He does look like Doug.  Who does music up in Woodstock now.  What's with the fucking gay Olympics jacket you're wearing there?  Yeah, yeah.  If you were going to go...  Purple.  Dude, if you were going to go to school, you needed a Columbia jacket.  You needed one.  Really?  Yeah.  Didn't they have different colors than that?  Probably.  Purple.  But all those Columbia jackets, they were always these two-tone.  It was like teal.  It was always some awful Easter colors.  Yeah.  This is how it was.  Oh, that's how it was.  All right.  Let's go to Dave in Nova Scotia. 
[00:56:30]  He's been waiting a long time.  It's early 90s.  We won.  Yeah.  We all have fucking bad pictures from the past.  Dave, what do you got?  Hey, boys.  How are you today?  Hey, man.  I always think they're going to take out the boxing and maybe start the fisting.  All right.  Instead of boxing, just call it fisting.  That's all right, boys.  Have a good one.  All right, man.  Let's go to Derek.  Derek.  Not D-Boy.  This is another Derek.  Yeah.  Derek.  Hey, what about the LeGarrette Blunt, the Oregon player that blindsided that guy on national  TV?  I don't know this one. 
[00:57:00]  Help.  The Oregon football player?  After the game, the guy came up talking smack to him and then the black guy turned around  and cold cocked him when he wasn't looking.  Oh, really?  Fuck, I want to see this video.  I don't think I saw this one yet.  I'm going to see that one.  Well, we're...  LeGarrette Blount.  Huh?  The guy's name is LeGarrette Blount.  B-L-O-U-N-T, I think.  Yeah, all right.  Hold on a line.  We're going to find that and then we're going to go back to you.  Anthony, very interesting news about the Gay Olympics.  Something else is going on in Cleveland that same weekend.  TJ's got the info. 
[00:57:30]  TJ.  Good evening.  TJ.  Yeah, I heard the gay circus is traveling along with the Gay Olympics.  The main attraction is a sword swallower.  Oh.  See ya.  Sword swallower.  All right, we got the video.  So, hold on.  Oh.  Derek, we got the video.  Guy went down.  So, was it a blindsided?  Well, it didn't look like his head was turned the right way.  Okay.  I don't think he was looking at it.  Oh, wait.  Is that the guy?  They kicked him out, right? 
[00:58:00]  Yeah, they're reinstating him now, I think.  Oh, they are.  He won that case.  I know this story.  Jesus.  Yeah, he really fucked up.  He fucked up his whole college career by...  Did he?  Yeah, it started in that fight.  Yeah.  Oh, he fucking just...  Right.  He totally blindsided him.  Wait, did they really reinstate that guy?  I didn't think he had a chance.  Look at this.  He's not looking.  Look, he's not looking.  Bam, right in the side of the jaw.  Yep.  Oh, my God.  And he goes down.  I don't like the blind side.  You're just all of a sudden standing there, and then you hear... 
[00:58:30]  And everything's all fucked up.  Yeah.  All right.  Let me go to Chris in Minnesota.  Chris.  How long have you been on the radio, Ant?  Many years.  Okay.  No, I'm just waking up.  I had a tough time waking up this morning.  Yeah.  I don't know what the fuck this stupid trout flew crap.  Chris, what do you got?  I heard they were going to change the shot put competition at the gay games because other 
[00:59:00]  pussies are strong enough to throw the ball.  So they're going to have the salad tossing competition.  Salad tossing.  Jesus Christ, man.  Did he get the point?  Yeah, I think we...  Should we move on?  I think we got it.  All right.  Highway just wants in about wrestling, though.  A little wrestling.  Highway Star, what do you got?  Hey, boys.  Hey.  Yeah, I'm a wrestling coach with the JV team.  And last year, this kid's wrestling, this big black kid. 
[00:59:30]  And so the whistle blows, they go back to the middle.  And my big, huge black wrestler is raging with a boner that is almost popping out of his  fucking singlet.  Singlet.  Everybody in the crowd is completely uncomfortable.  Oh, why do they have to wear singlets?  A singlet.  Why are they called singlets?  It should be a little looser.  And have a cool name for it. 
[01:00:00]  Something.  Yeah, didn't give it much room, that's for sure.  Yeah.  Very good.  Later, guys.  Thank you.  Bob in Philly.  Bob.  Hey there, Bab.  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  Hey.  Back to the way certain people like to fight there, I used to cruise this street.  It used to be real popular, cruise around with their windows down.  And once had an African-American gentleman come up to me and ask me what time it was.  And I look down, I look at my watch, and the next thing I know, I'm wondering what the 
[01:00:30]  hell hit me.  Yeah, that's the which way is north thing.  Yeah, that's our which way is north bit.  We talk about that.  That definitely happens in New York City.  In New York City, if somebody walks up to you and says, hey, which way is north, or which  way is, you know, they want directions, and you kind of...  Well, your move is, well, let me see.  And now you're kind of like, well, let me see.  And then you're trying to get your bearings, and you're kind of turning your head around.  Here's the thing, whoever approaches you knows where this certain location is. 
[01:01:00]  Of course, knowing that the person will have to turn in that direction.  Right, so they place themselves in an area around you, where you will then have to turn  your head and go, oh, and you point and go, okay, it's up this way, and then, bam!  Right in the side of the fucking head.  Co-fucking-K!  Yeah!  And if you wake up, all of your possessions will be gone.  That's right.  If it happens now, you're waking up in time for Groundhog's Day. 
[01:01:30]  That's why you look people right in the eye, and you go, I don't know.  You yell, you go, I don't know!  Leave me alone!  No, you never say, leave me alone.  Oh.  That's a little weakness.  You just look right in the eye, look eye, and you just say, I don't know, and you sound  a little crazy.  Co-fucking-K!  Sound a little crazy when you say it.  Or make this noise.  It's a shame that they're not more creative in other aspects of their life, I guess.  Oh, now, we're not stereotyping in that respect, because I'm sure there are plenty of people 
[01:02:00]  that, if they do get into a fist-to-cuffs, they fight completely, legitimately.  I'm just saying, from what I've seen, that that blindside move is used a lot.  Yeah.  More importantly, how are those Phillies doing there, sir?  You know what?  Not much of a Phillies fan.  From what I hear, though, they're not doing too well, so.  What's fucked up?  You know, that's what's fucked up about our listeners.  You know, you get a call from Phillies, dude.  Go, how are the Phillies?  This happens all the time, if you pay attention. 
[01:02:30]  Like, put City here.  Yeah.  And then you go, well, how's the team doing?  And nine out of ten times, the person I'm talking to on the phone is not a fan of that  City's team.  They don't care.  You know what?  I'm not much of a sports guy.  I'm what you guys would consider a nerd, so.  A nerd.  That's all right.  We like the nerds.  Hey, your wife likes it, though.  I can't complain.  All right.  Thank you, Bob.  We got Larry King checking in.  Very, very good.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, Larry, what do you got for the show today?  Larry King calling a question about the gay Olympics. 
[01:03:00]  Worst Larry King ever.  All right, Larry, what do you got?  How important is the cock?  Larry.  You sound a lot.  You sound a lot better.  Your voice sounds raspy.  Let's see.  Figure skeeting.  Are they incorporating the rest areas into the Olympics?  Into the Olympics?  Yeah, all the toilets will have holes drilled in the side of them.  Kellum from England.  Look at this. 
[01:03:30]  Good evening, gentlemen.  Hello, Kellum.  I just phoned to tell you that a lot of shit happens in England with some little punk going  up and trying to beat somebody up and someone trying to film it.  If you go onto YouTube, you can type in hacky slapping.  It was a trend for someone to go up to a random person and just slap someone in the face, film  it, and put it on YouTube and call it happy slapping.  Happy slapping.  I've seen happy slapping videos.  Thank you for reminding me.  You know what? 
[01:04:00]  I got to tell you, they're really funny.  It is funny.  Because I don't know the person and it's not me.  I wouldn't want to be the guy.  And that's how we all act.  Yeah.  It is funny because we don't know the person.  That's why the videos are funny because it's not you.  And I'm a big fan of...  You want to check out a band called the Towers of London.  They shot a video.  They're like a heavy metal hair band and they shot a video of some American guys.  Some yank started on the street and they just handed his ass to him. 
[01:04:30]  So if you type in Towers of London fights, you can check that out.  All right.  I like happy slapping.  That's a big fan.  Big fan.  Also, I was a big fan of Fire in the Hole.  And the media was outraged by those videos.  Will you throw back your soda?  I'm sorry.  I'm a big fan of those.  Because I don't know the people.  It's hilarious to me.  That was a fast food drive-thru.  And you'd order a large drink.  Right.  The media was outraged.  You'd order a large drink.  By the way, because people go, aren't you the media? 
[01:05:00]  That's why I know I'm not part of the media.  Me and Ed are not part of the media.  Because we think that shit's hilarious.  That's funny.  You'd order a large drink at the drive-thru window.  And then they'd pull up and they'd give you the drink.  And as they're futzing with change or whatever, you yell, fire in the hole.  And you just wail the drink at the person.  That's horrible.  They're great.  You've got to do it with some kind of icy, ice-creamy concoction is the best.  Oh, my God. 
[01:05:30]  Boy, that moon is getting pretty big.  Really?  Yeah.  What does that mean?  Well, they're showing pictures of the moon.  And from what I've been watching here, because they're going to hit it with a booster rocket.  Right.  I think it's scheduled to hit in about 15 minutes.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So we should take a break so we're back live for it, maybe?  Oh, we could do that.  Josh in Boston has a little info on that Oregon fight.  Because this was a big sports story, and I'm trying to remember all the fire in the hole.  Just watch the fire in the hole. 
[01:06:00]  Oh, God.  Just wail it back at the guy.  Look, it's wrong.  I understand that.  Fire in the hole.  Poor kid's just trying to make a few bucks so he can take his best gal out on a Friday night.  Poor bastard.  Just some high school kid.  Yeah.  Yelling fire in the hole makes it funny, by the way.  Like, if it's just tossing it, it's like, all right, it's kind of funny.  But fire in the hole.  Is this the media all pissed off?  Live in Westmoreland County, I'm Jennifer Mealy.  Channel 4 Action.  Water ice in the polar regions of the moon. 
[01:06:30]  What do we got going on?  We got too many things.  I got the NASA feed up also.  Oh, okay.  All right.  Josh, what do you got on that football fight?  Rocket science and fire in the hole.  That's perfect.  What a difference.  It's perfect.  Actually, that's what they're doing at the moon.  Yeah, we're throwing a shake at the moon.  Fire in the hole.  What do you got, Josh?  Hey, I'm a long-time listener, first-time caller.  That kid in Oregon, he actually, after he cold-cocked the other player, was starting 
[01:07:00]  to get dragged out by his coach, who he started a fight with him.  And then on the way out, he was getting hassled, of course, by all the fans.  I think some guy threw some popcorn or whatever at him.  And he started trying to fight with the fans.  And then the cops and security came in, and they had to drag him out.  So that's really what got him in trouble.  Now, here's the deal.  There's a lot of really good college football players.  But this one, in particular, he was on the fast track to the NFL, right?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  He was a good player.  But they showed a... 
[01:07:30]  He screwed himself.  They showed him afterwards just cussing and yelling at everybody.  Yeah, and to follow this, he's a really good college football player that really has  a very good chance of going to the NFL.  And his attitude fucks the whole thing up.  But now I'm hearing they're reinstating him?  They might.  They might.  Yeah, supposedly.  Yeah, he's supposedly just ready for the NFL.  Maybe he's, you know...  Keep his attitude in check.  Maybe he's thought things over.  Nah.  And logically...  Let them all fight. 
[01:08:00]  Who doesn't love a good fight with their sporting event?  Thank you, Josh.  Have a good weekend.  All right.  What is this about?  What is going on?  Steve and Dallas, what's up?  How about them Cowboys?  Watch.  Are you a Cowboys fan?  I'm a Cowboy.  Huh?  Yeah, yeah.  Okay.  They suck.  All right.  Hey, hey, hey.  I got a better question.  Are you a Mavs fan?  Basketball about to start?  Not so much.  Fucking Cuban does a good job down there for you guys, though. 
[01:08:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, he does.  You should appreciate that, Mark Cuban.  Yeah, but being from Dallas, we're not big basketball fans yet.  Yeah, true.  All right.  So what do you got, Steve?  We're not going to win a championship.  Yeah, what do you got?  Ooh.  Nice, tiny.  Speaking of holes, we've got holes.  We're not listening.  We're not listening.  Some girl is...  Oh, God damn.  What the fuck is she doing?  Where...  Can you explain this?  Where was this taken? 
[01:09:00]  I don't know.  It looks like...  Is she smelling her fingers after she was scratching her ass?  It's this hot chick from the back.  Really hot chick from behind.  Surveillance camera in some type of store.  She walks up to the counter.  Now she's putting her hand down the back of her jeans.  What an ass on this girl.  Jesus.  And then she goes way down.  Way down.  Way down to, like, our fingers are at bunghole area.  And then she comes up.  And she smells her fingers.  And now she's kind of rubbing her fingers together to feel what's in there. 
[01:09:30]  Did she pull out a dingleberry or something?  I don't know.  She's feeling like...  Where do they find this one there, Danny?  They're going to yell and scream at me, so help me out.  They can look at my Facebook feed.  Oh, God.  Is that where it is?  Oh, my fucking king.  That's how you get a plug-in for your Facebook.  That's a good one.  What's your Facebook page, Danny?  It's Facebook.com slash HelloExactly.  Cole fucking K. 
[01:10:00]  Oh, my God.  I will put this up there immediately.  Yeah, do it immediately.  That's a good one.  What do you got, Steve and Dallas?  I was going to mention, you guys have put up with the holes in radio for years.  Now Obama's going to have to put up with the holes in pickup basketball games.  Why is that?  Thanks to the media.  Yeah, the media's pissed, and the women in the country are pissed because he didn't include  any women in his pickup basketball games this week. 
[01:10:30]  Why does he have to have women in his pickup basketball games?  It's not about it.  They should be home cooking.  Everyone knows that.  What the hell is that about?  Now, that's going to show what kind of a guy Obama is, Ant.  That'll be very interesting.  Does he fold under the pressure and all of a sudden have to have women in his pickup games?  I'm sure he will.  Why?  Because he probably will apologize to them.  I'm sorry.  When I was playing a lot of basketball, there was only one woman that could keep up with us. 
[01:11:00]  So she played.  Who cares?  She good?  Yeah.  As long as she was good, yeah.  Where's this story?  Steve, where is this story?  I saw it on the ABC World News this morning.  They actually had, I'm not sure of her name, Sabayas or whatever, call him out.  They asked her if she thought she could beat him in a free throw contest, and she actually 
[01:11:30]  said, well, I actually made my college basketball team, so we'll see.  All right.  All right.  Yeah, we'll follow that one.  The newsroom will follow that story for the Opie and Anthony show.  Thank you, sir.  I think we're good for now, Ant.  Wow.  That was a good hour and 20 minutes.  My God.  I'm just watching this.  Now you can kind of see it moving.  What?  You can kind of see the moon kind of ticking closer and closer to the screen.  I can see a big crater. 
[01:12:00]  Is the footage online good?  It's, you know, not bad.  Like looking at the moon.  I only like when it gets really big.  It's all it's going to do is get big, and then you're just going to see.  No, how does the moon expand like that?  Some nights it's really small in the sky, and other nights it's really big.  It's really strange.  Oh, yes.  It all has to do with the moon bloating.  The sun light hitting the moon.  Are you trying to tell me the moon doesn't get bigger and smaller? 
[01:12:30]  No, no, not at all.  Yeah.  No.  I'm watching it like, where is it going to hit that crater?  Where's it going to hit?  It's amazing.  Pictures from outer space.  All right.  We're going to take a break.  All right.  I think we need a work horse promo here, Ant.  We are the workhorses of SiriusXM.  Do not forget that.  So are Ron and Fez, by the way.  This channel is filled with workhorses.  Yeah. 
[01:13:00]  While other channels get a lot of fucking time off.  Oh, yeah.  We're jealous.  Wish we did.  Oh, we're jealous.  We're not going to lie to you.  Yeah.  But at least we're still here giving you live programming around the clock every day of the week.  You know what's hysterical, too?  What?  They're showing mission control for this mission.  It really looks like the set of Live from the Compound.  Oh, really?  It's a very small little room.  It's not quite like Apollo 13, the movie, where you see just rows of consoles and everything. 
[01:13:30]  There's, you know, a few people hanging out, and they got some computers, a couple of models, things.  It's great.  Yeah, when we get back, I think we're going to blow up the moon, so we'll check that out live.  See if we blow up or something happens.  But first, your workhorse promo.  O.B. and Anthony, the workhorses of Satellite Radio. 
[01:14:00]  It's the O.B. and Anthony Show.  Sitting in for a little Jimmy Norton, Patrice O'Neal.  The great Patrice O'Neal.  Big mama prods on Twitter.  That's very nice of you.  I follow your tweets.  That's very, very nice of you.  You tweeted that you were going to be on a big radio show this morning.  Yeah.  The O.B. and Anthony Radio Show.  Yeah, but you pumped it up a little bit.  At O.B. and O.B. Radio and at Anthony Cumia. 
[01:14:30]  That's how you have to talk now with that at sign.  Yep.  You know what I mean?  That's what I'm talking about.  What's up, at big mama prods?  Big mama prods.  They're all clapping, so I guess something could happen.  What happened?  We just blew up the moon and we're clapping.  Where's the kaboom?  There's supposed to be a moon shattering kaboom.  I don't know if we should be fucking with the moon.  I don't know.  Do we have enough knowledge to be fucking with the moon?  We don't have enough knowledge to fucking make the wheel.  We should have just left that alone, too. 
[01:15:00]  These fucking scientists are just trying to prove there's no God.  That's all they're doing.  We are God.  There's a scientific reason for everything.  We're our own God.  As soon as there's an old white man with a thunderbolt that decides to walk in and talk  to everybody, we're going to regret it.  But this is what I say to the scientists.  What if God is a scientist?  Think about that one.  We're getting drunk tonight.  Think about it.  Could be.  I'm thinking about it now.  What do you think? 
[01:15:30]  Okay.  I don't know.  It shuts up all the scientists.  God's a scientist.  Like Dr. Michio Kaku.  That cool.  It crashed into the moon, much like in the movie Speed.  He's got to talk to us like we're retarded people.  What was the one he did?  The Pinocchio.  The Looking Glass in Alice in Wonderland.  Is this an Asian one?  Alice in Wonderland.  Yeah.  We love this fucking guy.  Dr. Michio Kaku, what's your thoughts on dying?  What happens to the body after you die? 
[01:16:00]  The soul.  Well, I believe your spirit leaves your body much as if you watched the Disney cartoon Alice in Wonderland.  Much like she left her own world to go into the rabbit hole.  Your body.  Right.  I get it.  He told us.  Explain like fucking space time continuum.  Who's the other one that talks with a piano? 
[01:16:30]  Talks with a piano.  Oh, no.  Bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah.  What's that?  Fucking Hawking.  Yeah, Stephen Hawking.  Stephen Hawking.  Who is smarter than all of them put together, by the way.  Yeah, he just rolls around.  Proving there is a God.  God's like, you know what?  All right.  You escaped me and you got a lot of knowledge, but I'm going to make it hard as a motherfucker for you to communicate.  He explains space.  Let everyone know what you know.  Yeah.  I've seen something where he explains space so well that I understood space.  It gave me a whole nother concept of what space is. 
[01:17:00]  In that computer voice?  Dude.  No, no.  It was on one of the history channels, but they would not allow him to wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.  They would not allow his fucking Charlie Brown piano to be playing the whole show.  I will now explain space.  This is what space is.  It is a void and a vacuum that goes on forever.  You're talking way too fast, too, by the way.  It is a void, a vacuum that goes on forever, infinite. 
[01:17:30]  But it may not fit and turns through wormholes and black holes.  Why?  As his head's just laying on a fucking like a rotten grapefruit on his shoulder.  He is a fucking genius.  These people better leave space alone, baby.  Mm-hmm.  Or they're going to prove these dirty Mayans right.  Ha, ha, ha, 2012.  What?  These apocalypto motherfuckers.  Ah, fucking. 
[01:18:00]  You know something?  That's such a load of horse shit.  Horse shit to the highest degree of horse shit.  This shit's been going on forever.  It's just a new Y2K, right?  Yeah, it's a new fucking, oh, God, Stephen Hawking's face.  It's just melting.  I am smart.  Universe, it would be a great triumph of human reason, but it wouldn't leave much for us to do.  Look at his eyes.  We need an intellectual challenge.  This is a yes or no.  It would be the greatest achievement of science since Einstein's theory of relativity. 
[01:18:30]  Yes.  Thinking about this universe that you think about, what worries you the most about the future of the universe?  Oh, tree Jesus.  I'm not worried about the future of the universe.  The universe will continue whatever happens.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  But the future of the human race and of life on Earth is much less certain. 
[01:19:00]  Oh, you're in danger of destroying ourselves by our greed and stupidity.  Nice.  You have said that humanity's ultimate survival, then, depends, depends on colonizing the solar system.  It has taken about four billion years for life on Earth to develop to the present stage.  During that period, the main threat has been from collisions with comets every few million years. 
[01:19:30]  Ha, ha, ha.  But now the man-made dangers to our survival are much greater and ever increasing.  Is he dead?  If we remain confined to planet Earth, sooner or later, we will destroy ourselves.  Here's the next question you should ask.  Yeah.  Who's the next smartest guy than you, sir?  Yeah.  And he names his name, and I go, I'm going to interview that motherfucker if he's not in a wheelchair and speaking with a fucking accordion.  I don't want to talk to you anymore. 
[01:20:00]  But this is on YouTube.  The guy is not even moving at all.  No, no.  So how is he answering that?  How the fuck is he doing that?  Is that some editing where Charlie Rose asks a question and then they wait an hour for him to, like, blink out his answer?  What does he use to actually fucking make it?  His fingers.  No.  No, his fingers ain't moving.  Yes, it is moving.  No, he's got one eyelid that works.  That's about it at this point.  And that's what he is connected to his fucking voice box.  That nigga, he invented the universe, man.  He invented the universe?  That's God talking through him.  You know what? 
[01:20:30]  And he's bitching about, like, how mankind is going to do this and that and destroy itself.  If it wasn't for fucking mankind's technology, you'd be, like, burnt at the stake for being some kind of fucking useless.  He didn't say, that doesn't mean.  Why do you have to be appreciative?  Wait a minute.  She's in a little skirt.  I'm going to have to call that back.  What's going on?  Oh, nothing.  Nothing.  Oh!  Good for you.  Good for you.  Ship sale.  Just stop it.  I heard a little bit of that.  You're tired of beating your balls to death of the memories. 
[01:21:00]  You're tired of a smash.  You're saying he needs a new memory?  Yeah.  I was just looking.  I told you I was over there.  It's very lonely after a while sometimes.  You're just that big, beautiful place.  You're going to party so much, right?  And then you just want to bitch around.  It's just into you.  It's just looking like, you know.  I like the hair isn't like fakey, blondie thing.  The little short skirt today.  Just say it.  Yeah, she's quietly listening to you from before. 
[01:21:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And she's saying, Anthony, I think you're right.  She's putting out signs to you.  Oh, you think it's signals?  Oh, yeah.  You guys are communicating.  Is the TV talking to me?  Oh, yeah.  Should I put foil on my head?  Uh-huh.  You're getting that little thing where you go, ooh.  Where you thought of a good night and just went, ooh.  And you're trying to recreate it with one of these fucking retarded little girls.  Retarded.  Who jerks you off with two fingers as she closes one eye and looks to the side.  She's jerking you off how Stephen Hawkins looks. 
[01:22:00]  She's just like, I'm jerking you off.  Are you almost there yet?  Do you need to end up?  Oh, my God.  When will you come?  Please clean up.  When you had a nice little trooper that probably just took it all as you gave us.  Eh, you know, nah.  Look at him.  Look at him.  Just look at him.  I'm just looking.  He's pining away a little bit.  No, no, no.  There's no pining.  I'm just looking going like, eh, looks better than before. 
[01:22:30]  Yeah.  But she don't.  Looks better.  She looks exactly the same.  No, no.  I think the hair looks better.  He's just missing what it was.  Nope, I'll give compliments where compliments are due.  The hair looks better, natural, like that.  And the short skirt thing there on today's outfit wasn't too bad.  Not too shitty.  That's all you're saying, right?  Looking pretty good.  But to be honest, it never was too bad.  Before, listen to what you're saying now.  No, no, I'm not saying.  You're saying, hey, she's looking pretty. 
[01:23:00]  But imagine before you got a piece of that, you was like, ooh, it was certain person's name  television.  Oh, of course.  Ooh, ah, ooh, ooh, ah.  Yeah.  Now you're looking like, wow.  You know, and then you kind of just go, oh.  And you have what they have, reference points.  You have a jerk file that you can go through.  A jerk file.  What's wrong with a jerk file?  A jerk file.  I go back to 96. 
[01:23:30]  I have a jerk file back to 96.  How far do you go back?  Really?  To 96?  Let me think about this.  96, I have a jerk file, man.  I got some 80s.  You got a jerk file from the 80s?  I got a few 80s.  Wow, let me think.  Absolutely.  Jesus.  I got some 80s in my jerk file.  What did she do?  Suck your asshole?  Who the fuck has a jerk file from the fucking 80s?  Oh yeah, I got an 80s.  Is that her right there?  Huh?  No, no, no.  No.  That's a flat zone.  What's wrong with you, Patrice?  What, you trying to say all white girls look alike? 
[01:24:00]  A lot of times.  How dare you?  A lot of times.  How dare you as a black man say that?  You know what white girls have physically that bothers me?  They all have this.  Jobs?  Not sure.  That doesn't bother me.  Okay.  Any well-respected black men, that makes me, any bitch that can up my credit, nigga.  They have this thing on their stomach where it looks like bone, but it's, uh, it look  like a tire, but it's, it's bone.  It's not soft.  It's hard looking. 
[01:24:30]  Oh, it's like where the ribs end?  Like a hippie.  Where the rib cage ends?  Yeah, like a hippie weird.  What, you talking about the, the hip bones?  Oh, cause it's not covered up with fucking, like, fucking booty fat that came around from  the ass.  All white women have that thing where it looks like, and it's, and it hangs over  where the ass is supposed to be.  It's just like a fat, hard thing, like a growth.  I really don't know what you're talking about in the front?  On the side.  Yeah, the side is like a...  Oh, that's just cause their jeans inside.  It's like a deformity. 
[01:25:00]  No, it's a white girl deformity.  They all have them.  No, it's called the pelvis bone, which is covered up by booty meat on black girl.  I know what a, I know what a, I know what a, I know what a, I know what a pelvic bone  is.  Booty meat goes around, like, from the ass.  Booty meat covers everything up.  All the way down the thighs and shit.  It's a strange looking thing the white girl's got.  It's a weird disease.  Yeah, a weird disease.  It's pelvic, pelvic bonia.  It's something wrong with it.  It's, that's why, you know.  I'm not gonna say they all have flat asses.  White girls have done something to where they got asses now. 
[01:25:30]  They have nice asses.  That used to be the knock on of growing up in the black communities, that they got flat  asses.  But they're, a black girl without an ass is just fucking like, that's so rare.  Drone to the wayside.  Oh, there she is.  That's like, you take the, uh.  Huh?  You know what, dude?  She looks a lot different.  It's like, it's better with the darker hair.  And she's talking to mock dumb DaCostas.  Look at that motherfucker.  Who's that one? 
[01:26:00]  Who's the other girl?  And now she's been upgraded to talking.  Oh, yeah.  No, she's, she's the star of Channel 11.  She's been upgraded to talking.  Yeah, they're trying to get the ratings up, I think.  They got a little short skirt on her and shit.  Do you miss that?  What's going on?  No, no.  It's not a miss thing.  Do you miss a slide then?  It's just, uh.  No, no.  It's not a miss thing at all.  No.  You don't miss it at all?  No, no.  Because, like, the way things ended is too, it's just too weird.  It's like nuclear explosion.  Yeah, okay.  It was nuclear explosion.  So when you think back and you get that little ooh feeling? 
[01:26:30]  No, I don't get, I don't think back.  I can't remember any of the ooh feeling because the ending was so, you know.  It's like Hiroshima.  So the sex wasn't, like, memorable?  Hiroshima doesn't remember anything else about World War II.  Except for the bomb going off.  That's very fair.  That's an understandable point.  So the sex wasn't, like, damn.  No, you know.  Oh, come on.  It had to be good, eh?  Yeah, yeah.  That's what I'm saying.  Well, yeah.  So what was the big thing you missed that you can't get from these teenagers? 
[01:27:00]  Nah, there's nothing I can't get with a roofie.  A roofie in a gun closet.  Everybody's accommodating.  A roofie in a gun to your head.  Very accommodating and nice.  You know, this is called the Desert Eagle, sweetie.  Watch what this does to a model of your head made out of a cantaloupe.  Check out my videos.  Now, do we understand each other?  Do you understand without me having to say anything?  Wait a minute. 
[01:27:30]  And this is when he has a hemmed up and she's like, the cops come and she's like, I feel better now.  And the cops come to the door and go, hey, Ant, how are you?  Hey.  Kidnapped another one?  Oh, Jesus.  And you got your Henry Lee Lucas t-shirt on as you show it a Desert Eagle bullet.  You don't even use the fucking gun.  And you just have a peach and you shove the bullet right into the peach.  And you go, look at what it does.  It goes right through that seed. 
[01:28:00]  It's just like.  Hey, were you in Albany recently?  Yes.  Fucking people saying you killed up there.  Dude.  Just want to make sure you get your compliments out there.  I'm a professional.  Thank you, Albany.  It was a blow to the ego.  Why?  Nobody really showed up in Albany.  Dude.  It was a rough one.  People don't have money right now.  Don't get mad at me.  I'm just saying it was a rough.  I'm trying to help you out.  I'm not saying that they fucked them.  I enjoyed the people that were there.  I don't think it has anything to do with you is what I'm saying.  People are coming back right now.  I was in Saratoga. 
[01:28:30]  That's supposed to be really nice.  Saratoga and Albany.  Please.  Were you up there for the horse racing?  No.  It wasn't the season.  August is horse racing month, right?  It wasn't the season yet.  I think it was off.  The season was off.  Okay.  But I got to drink a Saratoga Springs water.  How is that?  It's water.  Horseshit.  Fucking a bunch of horseshit.  It's all horseshit.  It's evil.  What, they brag about their water up there?  That's their big thing is water.  And what do you get from their water that you don't get from New York City water?  A conversation.  That no one cares about. 
[01:29:00]  They just discuss their water.  Which is why I say life is for people say life ain't fair.  I go life is very fair.  We all have water to drink.  We came in with water to drink.  God gave us water, air, food.  Yeah.  But at some point someone said, I'm going to sell water.  And we bought in.  And if you can't afford it, Africa, Thailand, go fuck yourself.  People aren't fair.  Life is very fair.  People are terrible. 
[01:29:30]  Yep.  To sell water.  How did we buy into the water scam?  I don't get it.  As you drink out of a water bottle, by the way.  Ronnie Bennington brought up a great point.  He goes, who would have thought like 20 fucking years ago or so that we'd be getting free long  distance phone calls and paying for water?  That's amazing.  That's something you never would have thought would ever happen.  Free long distance calls and you're paying for your water all the time.  And the fear.  How many people drink out of a fountain? 
[01:30:00]  Dude, when was the last time you fucking filled up a glass from your faucet?  I did.  I fucking don't buy bottled water.  Let me tell you something.  I told you my refrigerator broke the water part, which I was so proud of.  Like when you grow up poor, there's some things you'd go.  Every time I get a glass of water out of my refrigerator, I just feel like I made it.  When you push the glass in there, just a glass of water and that ice thing works.  I still fill up through the refrigerator. 
[01:30:30]  I fucking love the refrigerator.  New York City has some of the best water in the country.  It's delicious.  It's fucking delicious.  I'm talking out of the refrigerator is one thing.  Out of the faucet I'm talking about.  Yeah.  I've done it.  Old school.  You just take a glass.  Yep.  Really?  Haven't done that in I don't know how long.  Why?  Because you listen to people.  Because I got bottled water all in my refrigerator.  But why?  Because you seem better than that to just listen to people tell you to drink.  Because when you're in water.  It's fucking convenient as hell to grab a bottle and I'm out the door.  It's less convenient to turn your faucet on? 
[01:31:00]  Yeah.  It's right there.  Are you fucking joking me?  What am I going to do?  I leave in the morning for work.  I like ice cold water for my drive into work.  So what am I going to do?  I'm going to fill up a glass and put it in my console?  That's what you used to do.  Well, I used to do a lot of things I don't do now.  And now you take this shitty water, which by the way, the best bottled water are the  ones, if you look closely, purified.  Oh, just purified water.  Just britter in a bottle.  They just decided to bottle tap water that they, you know, but Dan and Poland Springs sickened 
[01:31:30]  me.  I don't care.  You know what the thing is?  Here's my deal.  It's not even the water itself.  Okay.  If somebody filled up bottles from the tap and put them in the refrigerator.  You'd drink that.  I would think that was the best fucking thing.  It's the convenience of the bottle.  Why don't you just have a big cup with one of those coffee things with a little sip thing  in there?  No, no.  It's got to be a bottle.  You put it on there and you drink it.  I can't throw those at fucking cabbies when they, like, cut me off and then stop in traffic. 
[01:32:00]  You're adding to the destruction of the planet.  And wing that fucking bottle out the window.  We got to live.  We got to live.  What about your niece?  What's a bottle going to do?  What about the world for your niece?  They'll figure something out.  We did.  You don't care.  We figured shit out.  You don't care about the people coming out.  You ever see the last Die Hard?  Yeah.  The last one?  Like, the last new one.  The new one.  Yeah.  Very good point that the kid goes, let somebody else do it.  And he says, kid, you think there's somebody else?  There's no one else.  No.  We got to do it.  No, we don't.  There's nobody else.  Necessity gets things done. 
[01:32:30]  We don't have to do anything right now as far as the environment goes because I go outside.  I'm not burning up.  I'm not freezing.  It's not 80 below when we go outside.  And it's not fucking 120 degrees in the summer.  But see.  No, here it is.  But you're making the weather out to be.  See, here's what we do wrong.  We give everything human traits.  This is where we fuck up.  We give the weather human traits.  It's like, hey, I'm outside.  The weather.  You can walk outside and then the world can decide to eat you. 
[01:33:00]  Yeah.  Soon as you walk outside.  Exactly.  Soon as you walk outside, there could be some type of weird hailstorm and the hail will kill you.  So we give everything these traits like, hey, it's just today or tomorrow.  That shit can just happen this second.  So you got to be aware of it this second.  Let me give you a prime example of what I'm talking about.  We live our lives on this planet as human beings and we advance.  We use our technology.  We do this. 
[01:33:30]  Sometimes it fucks shit up.  And then it's people.  Then the next generation can fix it.  We're very adaptable human beings.  So then they fix shit.  Here's a prime example.  Where are all cell phones at right now?  Where the fuck are all those things?  They're in people's drawers and shit.  He don't give a fuck.  You know where they're at?  They're in China.  China and they got some children out there.  Yeah, in a big dump.  And they're picking out what's good for those phones.  And the rest are just in a hole in China. 
[01:34:00]  Oh, well.  Why China?  Who else does anything?  China.  We can't bury them here in America.  You're not going to let me make my fucking point.  Oh, go ahead.  Sorry, sorry.  You're not going to let me make my point on a prime example of what happened in the past  that shows, that proves my fucking point.  Okay, go ahead.  We farmed the Midwest to the point where we completely obliterated the topsoil.  It was called the Dust Bowl.  The entire middle of the fucking country turned into dust. 
[01:34:30]  Okay.  And the wind blew and people fucking were dying.  They left the Midwest.  We could not farm the Midwest anymore.  Do you think the people that did that fixed it?  No.  Over time, people realized, you know what we've got to do?  Crop rotation.  Proper irrigation.  We have to do it.  And people figured out how to farm the Midwest without fucking it up.  No, they didn't.  Yes, they did. 
[01:35:00]  They invented a company called Monsanto.  Monsanto.  Yes.  That create what they call genetic modified shit.  They've done that too.  But they had to learn how to rotate crops and irrigate and bring water from other areas.  They fixed the problem.  They didn't fix it.  They took one thing.  You look at the fucking fly over the Midwest.  You look down.  What do you see?  Farms, farms, farms.  You ever see round farms?  I'm sure you've seen The Matrix. 
[01:35:30]  Of course.  I love The Matrix.  Fucking, what is the guy's name?  Agent?  Smith.  Smith.  Who's just like...  Mr. Anderson.  The explanation of people.  The explanation of what we are.  We go someplace and we multiply.  You even help your landlady take out her garbage.  We're the worst.  We take it.  And I'm paraphrasing, but it's such a great thing.  I got to go home and get it. 
[01:36:00]  But we take everything.  We go to someplace.  We multiply.  We take from that.  Every other thing is at harmony with their environment.  We take.  We fuck.  Until there's so many of us that we have to move on to take and fuck and destroy the next thing.  Things compensate.  We're viruses.  So when you come and you take water.  Irrigation means you take something and you put it somewhere else.  We rerouted it.  But then the other thing is fucked up now. 
[01:36:30]  We're not harmonious.  We didn't need that other thing.  We're destructive.  The other thing, getting water, wasn't as important as putting water...  Yeah, an African.  ...where we can...  ...putting water...  ...putting water...  ...fucking asshole.  ...a fucking kid somewhere.  That's why...  That's why the Midwest doesn't have a little fucking naked kid sitting there with flies running around the head.  There's a pipe running from Guatemala to fucking Idaho somewhere.  But if they fucking Zimbabwe would figure out how to get some water... 
[01:37:00]  It's Zimbabwe!  Let Zimbabwe figure out how to pipe some water in and perhaps they wouldn't be a little kid with flies on his head.  You can't be like this, man.  No, I'm like this.  You're not going to change him.  Give up on him.  Talk to others.  It comes from the Colorado River.  First of all, the Colorado River feeds Los Angeles.  There would not be a Los Angeles if we didn't figure out how to take water from the Colorado River...  ...and pipe that shit right in.  There would be a desert where Los Angeles is right now.  But we figured out how to pipe that shit in. 
[01:37:30]  We know how to do things.  From the Colorado River.  Colorado River.  What about the Colorado River now?  It's down to Grand Canyon.  The Grand Canyon's done.  It don't need the water anymore.  It way is...  Yeah, if it keeps digging, it's going to split the earth in half.  It's so awful!  It's going to stop.  That thinking is so bad, Hannity!  It's so wrong!  No, it's fantastic that we can do this stuff.  What's so wrong about it?  We're just another life on this planet, but we figured out how to change things into metal 
[01:38:00]  and fucking, you know, we take dirt, rocks, air, wood, and fucking mix them all together  and make flying machines!  And make things that aren't harmonious with the earth.  Why does it have to be?  Because we live here.  Why does it have to be harmonious?  It does!  If the earth decides we don't...  If the earth fucking decides we shouldn't be here anymore, believe me...  Why are we the only animals on earth, right, that kill, but it's called murder? 
[01:38:30]  It's because we kill without harm.  We don't kill for reasons.  We're the only motherfuckers that do shit frivolously because we feel like it.  We don't do it because we have to.  We don't do it for the right things.  That doesn't have anything to do with doing the right thing and doing the wrong thing.  Your right thing and wrong thing is based on what?  This fucking morality that we have?  On conjecture.  It's just based on feeling.  Having a fucking feeling.  This morality that's been fucking...  What feeling?  It's just based on having humanity. 
[01:39:00]  And I hate having humanity.  We don't jump out and grab another fucking guy by the throat with your teeth and shake  him.  We're blowing up the moon.  What the fuck for?  Do you understand?  Yeah, what did the moon do to us?  Why are we doing this?  We're seeing if there's water there.  For what reason?  Because if...  So we could go up there and destroy that...  If there's a future where we decide to go there and build a moon base...  Because what, Anthony?  Because we can't live on earth anymore.  Exactly.  Because we destroyed it.  Why the fuck do we need to think about leaving earth? 
[01:39:30]  Yeah, that's the only reason.  No, I'll tell you.  Why are we going to Mars?  Why are we going to Jupiter?  We have to colonize all these places as human beings.  Because there could be possible resources to use there.  To destroy...  You know who we are?  We're the Independence Day aliens without spaceships.  Fucking Patrice.  We're the worst.  All we do is take until there's nothing left.  And there's only a few people that know that there's not a lot...  Let me tell you, man.  And this is, again, did not divulge or digress. 
[01:40:00]  Yeah.  It's the same thing.  Right now, this is at the top of the conspiracy theory ladder.  Okay?  That's people are having tough times thinking.  I read an article that said, how do we stop global warming?  It's in England.  And whoever the Surgeon General person over there is, she says, by using condoms, right, to stop having people be around.  We're at the point that we're sucking up the world dry so much that the plans is to kill people that don't need to live. 
[01:40:30]  Yeah.  Because there's too many of us.  And all we do is take, take, and take that we have to now go, okay, we're not thinking about stop taking.  We're thinking about killing people and making them take fucking vaccinations and shit.  And a doctor was telling my woman, she went to the doctor, and the doctor there said, the fucking H1N1 flu shot can't get it if you're an old person. 
[01:41:00]  Can't get it if you're in your 60s or 60s.  I think that's crazy because they're some of the first people that get it because the elderly and children...  They don't get it.  Yeah, I read that too.  The fucking elderly have to die from this shitty whatever they're going to do.  The earth itself, let me, let me, let me explain.  The earth itself takes care of things like overpopulation.  It fucking just naturally takes care of it.  I'll give you an example.  Okay.  Fucking, some, there are some places on earth where the populace cannot sustain themselves. 
[01:41:30]  There is starvation, there is horrible living conditions, and bingo.  It is the fucking petri dish of disease that then kills a lot of people to keep them in check so there isn't more people starving and fucking...  This is shocking that you're saying this.  But it is.  But that's what nature does.  That's not natural.  It is too. 
[01:42:00]  This is people not...  Plagues aren't fucking natural?  Let me ask you a question.  A plague that comes up and kills fucking millions of people...  Let me ask you a question.  ...thins the herd.  If water just stopped pumping to your house, and something happened where your car stopped, you couldn't get to anywhere, there was no stores, within 10 miles.  Oh, boy.  No water.  Yeah.  No gas.  No nothing.  Okay?  How the fuck would you stop yourself from being some shitty third world person? 
[01:42:30]  What would you do?  I'm not saying...  What do you know how to do to keep yourself alive if the conditions aren't...  If some dictator decided that I'm gonna fucking just murder people and people are gonna live in shitty conditions, what the fuck would you do?  I personally am a pretty good survivalist.  But I'll tell you something.  This nation would be fucked.  We're a bunch of spoiled motherfuckers.  I can't see a bunch of this nation marching somewhere as refugees.  We just would look silly in fucking designer shoes and everything else. 
[01:43:00]  But that's close to being kind of what we're doing, man.  You see how much they're saying the dollar's going down.  What the fuck?  If somebody...  If Obama...  Of course, we hate to have it happen and be the black dictator African guy.  But if that's gonna happen, if that happens and it's like, well, this is what's gonna be, or genocide, or FEMA camps, by the way, where they just put people where the...  You know, the president can lock you up and not have a reason to lock you up and keep you there. 
[01:43:30]  All that shit we learn on CSI just doesn't exist no more.  They just say...  The law is just like, shut the fuck up.  This is what's gonna happen to you.  Look at what happened to fucking...  I'm sorry, Katrina.  Yeah.  These motherfuckers...  We're not third world, but it became third world real fucking...  Real fucking fast.  That was a clusterfuck.  Yeah.  That was a clusterfuck.  Well, that's what I'm saying.  Well, why isn't...  You saying it's God over there, but it's a clusterfuck here.  Who made the fucking hurricane?  No one made Katrina to fucking... 
[01:44:00]  Oh, what?  We were responsible for that?  But that's what I'm saying.  That's all it takes.  It takes...  Of course.  It takes...  I'm agreeing with you.  I'm agreeing.  The Sahara Desert, all it takes is, at some point, 10 million years ago, it used to be a lot of shit and a lot of rain.  Yeah.  And at some point, it ain't no more rain.  You don't think that's natural?  And the people...  But that's not so that you die.  Maybe it is.  Maybe that's nature.  Farron, I can't argue.  Maybe it is.  A check and balance.  It's hard to argue.  Maybe it is.  You can't argue that. 
[01:44:30]  It's a possible argument.  It's a balance.  It's a check and balance.  It's hard to argue.  Why not?  Because for how much we fuck the Earth, for how much we supposedly fuck the Earth, the Earth fucks us right back.  With volcanoes, tsunamis, earthquakes, tornadoes, thunder and lightning, fucking hurricanes, floods.  We're constantly...  Hundreds of millions of people are getting killed by this planet.  The planet kills people. 
[01:45:00]  The planet kills.  But is that selective?  No, it's random.  It's just random.  It's random.  Random shit.  But it keeps things in check.  It keeps, you know, the population...  Oh, we'll fucking tsunami a quarter million people off the face of the Earth over here in Southeast Asia.  Ah, fuck it.  But what kills me is why can't we...  There's enough...  This is what gets me.  There's enough for everybody.  There's enough shit for everybody to have a goddamn home. 
[01:45:30]  There's enough shit for everybody to have a goddamn hamburger.  You're thinking America.  There's just enough.  You're thinking too American.  In the world, in the world, there's just enough shit.  There are places in this Earth, and I'm talking about...  Name a place where someone hasn't been living for 50 million years or whatever.  I'm talking a place like Sub-Saharan Africa.  People live there.  Sub-Saharan Africa is an awful place.  But people live there.  They don't live there.  They fucking exist there.  Living is inventing.  In a big house.  Is fucking... 
[01:46:00]  No, I'm talking fucking tribal shit that's still going on.  People hacking each other apart with machetes.  Why is that still happening in this year?  In this fucking day and age?  That's why I always...  That point is something I thought about, too.  It's insanity.  Black people always trying to kind of find Africa.  And I go, Africa gave us the worst things about us.  It's horrible.  Black on black crime is from Africa.  It's horrible.  It's like the idea that I would chop another nigga up with a machete came right from Africa, 
[01:46:30]  man.  Absolutely.  It's just a horrid place.  I can't understand.  I really hate to agree with a white guy.  Africa stinks.  I mean...  I'm not interested in Africa at all.  But still, the humanity of it, though, there's children.  There's a lot of humanity that we lack.  And I'm just saying, look, and I'm not just talking about philanthropy.  I'm talking about a company like Procter & Gamble, dude, that just has its fingers on... 
[01:47:00]  If I hated Procter & Gamble, you know what?  I'd be third world.  If I boycotted Procter & Gamble, I'd be like, hold the fuck up.  Yeah, I need that shit.  I'm fucking...  I'll stink.  I'll starve.  My house will be full of vermin.  It's one of those companies, like, you can do the right thing.  You have enough.  We have enough.  Like, okay, people talk about communism and socialism.  Yeah.  These ideas, there's nothing wrong with them.  It's the people who get their hands on these ideas.  The idea of communism where everybody's doing okay... 
[01:47:30]  It's very idealistic.  The idea of that is beautiful.  But the people who execute it are terrible.  I'll agree with you on that one.  But let's give me a break.  Everybody should be...  You know, Danny had a sandwich over here.  You know, you had your oatmeal.  Why the fuck is...  Is there an oatmeal shortage?  Why the fuck can't we all have some oatmeal?  I know this sounds crazy, but what the fuck?  Why are there people fucked up?  Without oatmeal, there's people starving.  It seems like an easy one to give everybody. 
[01:48:00]  Just give the world oatmeal.  Why do people over here at PAX eat oatmeal on purpose?  They go in, let me get a...  And there's tons of oatmeal.  Tons of it.  An African, I really would appreciate...  A little oatmeal?  A little oatmeal with some butter in it.  So let's spread the oatmeal.  Let me spread it.  I mean, I know I sound like we are all the world,  but it's just...  Come on, man.  Logistics, huge problem.  And you're right, people fuck it up.  And we do send a lot of aid over there as far as food goes.  No, we don't send a lot of aid. 
[01:48:30]  A lot.  We pay dictators.  This is what we do.  But those motherfuckers...  We pay dictators for their land to kill somebody.  They go, look.  Harry Kissinger's a motherfucker.  We are not fucking...  Ready?  Here's $30 million, Ugamba.  Ugamba!  John Ugamba.  I love their first name.  It's always Harold, and then their last name.  Harold Benbeque.  Here you go, dude.  Here's what we need you to do.  We're going to help you overthrow this pussy-ass motherfucker.  Okay? 
[01:49:00]  We're going to help you kill him, because he loves the people.  This is why they want...  Who's the dude in...  Oh, that real badass motherfucker.  Not Lula, but who's the motherfucker in Argentina?  Come on.  Oh, fucking...  That they all hate.  Yeah, yeah, that guy.  That guy.  Fuck.  Anyway, they hate him because he loves...  Chavez.  Of course.  He loves his people.  We don't need people around that love their people.  We need people that go hit...  This is why they hate Chavez. 
[01:49:30]  Hey, nigga.  Here's a billion good old U.S. dollars.  Give us all your oil.  All right?  This is what we're going to do.  We're going to loan it to you.  We want you to default on the loan.  Okay?  And at the same time, we need you to kill a whole bunch of your motherfucking people.  Here's what you do.  You keep our money.  The loan default.  We own your land now.  We get your resources.  And you kill a bunch of your goofy-ass people for me.  How's that sound?  And these goofy motherfuckers in Africa?  Yes.  Chavez is like, no. 
[01:50:00]  That's why they hate that motherfucker.  You don't never hear him hating motherfuckers who kill...  You don't...  Idi Amin never...  They did a movie about him.  He was wonderful.  Forrest Whitaker was wonderful.  That nigga killed 400,000 people.  Chopped him up.  Yeah.  Because he makes deals.  Yes.  They make deals.  And I'm saying, at the end of the day, these motherfuckers go in and they don't give aid.  They don't...  They're not saying, help your people.  They're saying, Mr. Dictator, do this for us.  You get this money.  And when shit go down, we're going to give you a nice jet plane over to a nice third world 
[01:50:30]  tropical country that's really not third world.  That's what we do.  We're not helping the fucking planet.  Look, what about the countries that don't even have a set up government that have been  in civil war with each other in Africa for years?  You're talking fucking civil war...  Zimbabwe is a good example.  Fucking the Congo, whatever it's called now.  They have leaders?  No, no.  They're warlords.  Yes.  They're warlords.  Horrible motherfuckers.  And they're like... 
[01:51:00]  They're not even defined borders anymore.  They're territories.  And the people are fucking starving and dying.  And whenever we bring aid in, it's taken by the warlords and then sold on their black  market.  When we bring aid, this is what I'm saying.  When the American government, our soldiers...  I didn't mean European, you know.  Our fucking...  Anybody in a developed country, soldiers come in and give these people food.  Motherfuckers just go...  We go...  Like, we drop it off at FedEx.  Yeah.  Take care of the food. 
[01:51:30]  Enjoy.  And they know a warlord's coming to take the food.  Oh, it's horseshit.  Well, sorry.  Wait, wait, wait.  We tried in one country to actually make sure the food gets to the people.  Sent troops over there to make sure that the warlords didn't take the food.  It was called fucking Somalia.  That's the only reason we were there.  We weren't there to fucking do anything but help the people get their fucking food from  the warlords and get that warlord out of there so the people would actually get food. 
[01:52:00]  We got fucked so bad, we turntail and ran our asses out of there.  Why don't we...  And Somalia's still a fucking mess.  Now, you just made something that makes a lot of sense to me.  Why don't we...  And this goes to what we're doing now.  This is what I mean to all the shit we do.  That we're just being told.  Because really, me and you are having a conversation based on what we feel.  Yeah, true.  Not what we know.  That's true.  And at the end of the day...  That's a little bit of what we need.  At the end of the day, Afghanistan... 
[01:52:30]  I don't know.  We're there to try to protect the world from something.  Yeah.  But if you said we're there delivering food to the people, and we have 50,000 troops  over there in Somalia delivering food to people, and we're fighting warlords so that we can  feed the people, that's a hell of a reason to fight a war.  But we don't fight wars over that.  I don't know why we're in Afghanistan, and I still don't know why Iraq...  What the fuck is that now?  Iraq has turned into something completely different.  So this is what I mean.  This is something...  It's just something's fucked up. 
[01:53:00]  But Clinton did send troops to Somalia so that they could feed the people.  That's what they were there for.  Yeah, black hook down, niggas.  That was the fucking thing.  Six motherfuckers with knives.  You got more rockets.  Exactly.  That's the fucking thing.  It's always underpowered because he didn't want it to look like we were doing this overwhelming  display of force when, in the meantime, we should have had an overwhelming display of force over  there.  But it becomes very political, and that's what's happening in Afghanistan right now. 
[01:53:30]  We're there because the Taliban sets up Al-Qaeda training camps.  And this isn't conspiracy.  This is what's been done.  They set up Al-Qaeda training camps.  This is what they're saying.  No, this is what happened when we went in there and killed off the Taliban right after 9-11.  And then all of a sudden, what are they, the Boy Stouts, they just came back together?  Yeah.  This is what, when did the Taliban with us there get more powerful than when we weren't  there? 
[01:54:00]  I don't want to say why.  I don't want to say why, but I might say there's a weaker fucking president in the White  House right now.  There's a weaker president.  I might say that interrogation tactics have been taken and shoved.  I'm taking the rest of the morning off.  And the CIA and FBI now have to worry if they're going to be convicted, if they smack  a guy around to get some information out of him.  What?  No.  Oh, like that doesn't have some effect on how a war is fucking fought.  When Obama's got to sit and accept his Nobel Peace Prize while a commander is sitting there 
[01:54:30]  going, I need more fucking guys.  And he goes, I'm thinking about it.  Don't think about it.  Give your commander what he needs to fight a fucking war.  What are they fighting?  The Taliban, they're fighting that whether this, look, I'm not saying this is good,  bad and different.  I don't know whether this will work, whether it's good or not.  Right.  But if you're going to commit to a war, commit to a war.  If you're not, get the fuck out.  Right.  One or the other.  If your commander is telling you, you want me to fight this war? 
[01:55:00]  I need this.  You give him this.  He knows better than you do.  But it's hard to fight a war when you're fighting a concept.  See, that's what I'm saying.  We're not fighting a people.  This is what I'm saying.  The Taliban is not a fucking force.  It's a terrorism is like saying we're going to fight ugly.  They were.  They were a.  I'm going to fight fat.  They were pretty much the the government of of Afghanistan, the Taliban.  Right.  They ran fucking shit there.  There would be headings in the soccer stadiums, all that used to go.  Hey, we're and they used to be dealt with as the government. 
[01:55:30]  Right.  Now they're dealt with as an army force.  Right.  That aren't a full.  This is what I'm saying.  You need more soldiers to do what?  But we you know what it is.  We don't have an answer for that, which is fucked up.  There isn't an answer to.  But we have a solution for something that we don't even have a question to.  That don't have an answer.  But we have the solution.  More motherfuckers.  I'll agree with you.  No.  If you're going to fight something, you need more motherfuckers or you need to get out.  And why can't he's a thing.  And again, I'm politically, man, I'm not going Obama's the greatest. 
[01:56:00]  And he's a president.  He's he's the GM of this country.  It's not going to change the next motherfucker, whoever that is.  I think it's going to be the young, young Republican, that young, that young white boy.  He's the only.  What is his name?  Well, the preacher.  Come on, man.  Oh, come on.  Good looking.  Good looking guy.  Preacher from Houston.  They're trying to get.  Oh, come on, man.  We'll get in a second.  Damn.  Anyway, I'm lost. 
[01:56:30]  So.  So he'll he'll he'll take Obama's place.  But it's not like this is Obamaville that we live in.  This is this is what kills me.  This is not Obamatown.  It's not like after he's finished, the next guy is going to have to repaint the United States back.  The color it was.  He's running this shitty country and he's doing.  I don't know what the fuck he's doing, but he's doing he's doing what presidents do.  It's not like after Bush.  And I'm not even blaming Bush because it's like, well, Bush did this. 
[01:57:00]  Bush did what presidents do.  He fucked up severe, too, with Iraq.  Complete fuck up.  That Iraq debacle.  But there was no debacle.  It was a bunch of shitty motherfuckers who wanted to rob people.  They went in for they needed a reason to go into Iraq and they went there and not to go that far back.  But the Obama thing, why?  Why wouldn't it be smart to have a president?  Right.  And this is this is what they need him for, by the way. 
[01:57:30]  A president that's not an old white man.  OK, now, if you send me the third, if I'm if if me and you, all of us are going discussing things like, hey, you know what?  We need to start going to make friends with some of these motherfucking brown people.  OK.  Joel Osteen is his name.  By the way, that's that's the next president.  That's the that's the motherfucker that's going.  Osteen.  Joel Osteen.  Watch, watch.  Interesting.  So if we need if we've had bad relationships and we're trying to change this idea because the world is becoming the world. 
[01:58:00]  It used to be the United States of America.  Very inclusive.  Very xenophobic.  Fuck the worst of the rest of the planet.  Now everything's outsourced.  We got to deal with a billion Indians, a billion Africans, a billion Spanish.  We also deal with that.  We also flew in and save the shit out of a lot of situations back in the day.  Yeah, we did.  But at the end of the day, I don't know if it was righteous, but at the end of the day, look, if we're going to make apologies to countries that have other than white people in it, we have to have another than white guy going around making these apologies. 
[01:58:30]  This is a government plan.  Obama can't do shit.  It's like, look, America is Burger King on McDonald's, dude.  The GM of a fucking McDonald's can't just do anything he wants.  The president cannot do anything he fucking wants to.  I think you're cutting him a little too short as far as what he can or can't do. 
[01:59:00]  You think there's a bunch of people.  He's like, this nigga's sitting there.  First of all, he said, fuck the Cambridge police, right?  They said, fuck you back.  He had these niggas over there for a cup of tea.  So that tells you what the fuck this country thinks of the black president.  That the HNIC has to apologize to a fucking racist cop?  Racist cop?  He just went there to fucking take out the whole other discussion.  Listen, let's not even get into that because, again, racism is just like Bigfoot.  We think it exists. 
[01:59:30]  Yeah, perish the thought a cop shows up with a fucking burglary call.  Oh, that son of a bitch racist.  Wow, he actually got a call.  That burglary is in progress.  He shows up.  There's some guy at the fucking house that starts mouthing off to him.  Wow, what a prick.  I'm going to tell you something.  You win that conversation because it's hard to know.  See, as a black man, I would want somebody to check on my house if somebody was coming.  As a guy that owns the house, I want somebody, the police, to come and check me.  And I go, hey, yeah, thanks, man, for coming.  And don't get all fucking lippy to the cop when he's trying to figure this shit out. 
[02:00:00]  At the end of the day, it's so hard for me to go, you're racist, without you going, yes, I am.  So you can do shit to me, and I'm black.  Like, you shoot a motherfucker 51 times, and he's black.  You go, that's racist.  But you go, nah, I shoot a white guy 51 times, too.  Like, it's hard to have that fucking conversation.  So at the end of the day, look, Obama cannot make his—he can't just go, hey, everybody, suck my dick. 
[02:00:30]  I'm going to Poland.  Like, you can't do that.  Well, I don't think you would say suck my dick.  I agree with you, Patrice.  I'd agree with the suck my dick part.  He is a—  The president just doesn't have that type of power anymore.  Thank you.  He's a—  I really believe that, too.  He's an image.  He's a worldwide tool for America to start being friendly with people who ain't white.  You don't think—  You're saying that Obama's like a Dave Thomas.  What's that? 
[02:01:00]  He's just kind of out there.  He—dude.  If I'm an African prime minister—  Dave Thomas of Wendy's, you know.  If I'm Asian, even though Asians don't like us that much, but other—but people hate  old white men.  You're the image—that Uncle Sam image with the—and the dead white guys on the dollar.  People are being fed up with white people around the globe.  They are.  Oh, the poor white—old white people that invented a lot of shit and fucking, like, built  up through civilizations, fucking engineered some of the greatest fucking thing. 
[02:01:30]  Are you saying civilization started in 1619?  No, I'm talking about—  With slavery?  I'm talking about wonderful things like the Roman fucking empire.  That crumbled.  Yeah, I'm not saying things last forever, but—  Crumbled.  But the technology that came out of that, the fucking—  Out of what?  Toilets?  They didn't do shit.  While Sub-Saharan Africa was fucking exactly the same as it is right now.  How about inventing a wheel?  For fuck's sake, a wheel. 
[02:02:00]  Christ on a pony, a wheel.  Jesus.  Fuck.  Yeah, I do—  Bring in aqueducts.  They were bringing fucking water a thousand miles so they could have running fucking baths  and fuck each other in the ass.  I'm just sweating.  And vomitoriums.  I'm sweating because—  It's actually hot in here.  It is?  Okay.  I was just—  The Dave Thomas thing was hammering your point home.  Like, Dave Thomas was the face of Wendy's, but did he do anything, actually? 
[02:02:30]  But that's what I'm saying.  What did—  So Obama's the face of America, but does he do a lot of stuff, or is there a lot of  other people behind the scenes doing a lot of this?  This is what fucks me up about the news and this and that.  Why the fuck don't they go—  Thank you, Danny.  Why don't they just go, uh, it's the government.  Like, why would Obama, as a name, get so much pressure?  Fair enough.  He appoints people.  But we should have an understanding that it has nothing—he appointed—let me tell you 
[02:03:00]  who's in his office.  It's Clinton's office.  No.  It's Clinton's.  His fucking attorney general.  And it's Rahm Emanuel.  And these fucking people, Anthony, at the end of the day, at the end of the day, you  know that the government has nothing to do with Obama.  It's the same shit.  But he—let me tell you something.  He—I believe one of the—one of the biggest things he did was his appointment of the attorney  general, who, by the way, is very radical, very left-wing, and can absolutely affect this 
[02:03:30]  country internally as far as our laws go.  So a radical left-wing person, what would be their agenda?  Like, would you be afraid of what a radical left-wing would be?  Again, personally, my Second Amendment right, I really—  Take away the guns?  Fair enough.  Yeah, I don't like that whole thing.  I've changed my views on a lot of this shit.  Getting a little loose on crime.  Getting a little loose on crime.  When you have an attorney general in there that's a little tougher on crime, maybe we're 
[02:04:00]  not as apt to have criminals back out on the streets so quickly.  Well, I mean, let's be honest.  Plexiglas Burris is going to jail for two and a half years.  Anyone would have, by the way.  For shooting his leg.  It was terrible.  And the fact that anyone would—  You're right.  I don't agree with that.  I don't agree with that at all.  That's all.  Some of these things—look, everybody who commits a crime shouldn't go to jail.  No, I agree.  I mean, you know what I mean?  Weed, shit like that.  Just stop. 
[02:04:30]  Yeah, cinema was in jail for years for that shit.  Underage sex.  Stop.  Yeah, please.  At least lower the age.  Yeah, what the fuck?  Come on.  Girls are maturing earlier these days.  We should take a break.  We got to take a break because we got to get into the Australian TV show thing, man.  Oh, wow.  Well, this is absolutely—  Yeah, I mean, Patrice picked a great day to come in.  You had a bunch of guys trying to do a little Michael—a little Jackson 5 bit on Australian  TV, and there's a lot of outrage.  Have you seen the video yet?  What?  Australia's fucking up. 
[02:05:00]  No.  Oh, it's great.  Is it—oh, no.  Well, we—  Oh, no.  We've heard that Australia's very racist.  You've heard?  Yeah.  Shit.  And they apparently are.  Jim Jeffries told us, right?  Jim Jeffries was like, yeah.  Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, very racist.  And Harry Connick Jr. is involved.  It's a good little story.  Could be the story of the day, Patrice.  Okay.  Harry Connick Jr., first of all—well, we'll get into it, but I got my opinion on poor Harry  Connick Jr. 
[02:05:30]  Wasn't he in Independence Day?  Why is he fucking—why is he a judge on an Australian gong show?  Motherfucker.  Marcel from Rhode Island.  Opie, after all this political talk, you compare Obama to Dave Thomas.  He goes—and Marcel goes, I can't wait to see you on Fox News.  I was just going with the CEO concept that Patrice started.  So I was just trying to give an example of what Patrice was getting at.  You know how funny that is?  The funny part is me and you are like, ah, socialism, suck a dick. 
[02:06:00]  And Opie goes, it's kind of like Dave Thomas.  Oh, my God.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, my, no.  No, just that.  You got these CEO guys.  Like, fucking Jim Cook, he doesn't make beer anymore, but he's the face of Sam Adams.  That's all I was trying to get at.  He's the nigger's bottle and James guy.  Right, there you go.  Bottle and James.  He's the nigger bottle and James just sitting on a porch. 
[02:06:30]  Holy shit.  And someone else saying Dave Thomas did run Wendy's and created it.  Yes, I understand that.  But later in his life, he just sat back and let everyone else do everything.  That's what I'm getting at.  We get the context.  Thank you.  I don't know if it was a good one, but I was trying.  I mean, we get the context.  You're allowed to have a mistake during context.  Oh, really?  All the time.  I guess you don't listen to this show.  All the time.  No mistake goes on.  Yeah, we're not allowed to have a mistake.  I nigh.  I nigh. 
[02:07:00]  I nigh.  He's sort of like.  I was just trying to get in there.  Oh, Jesus.  The bottles of James.  Remember those fuckers?  Oh, my God.  Trying to say that the president's on a porch?  Oh, here we go.  That's not what I meant.  I nigh.  I nigh.  I nigh.  I nigh.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit, man.  All right.  Let's take a little breather and then we'll.  Yeah, you know what?  Norton was on Leno. 
[02:07:30]  We haven't even discussed it.  He fucking killed last night.  Yeah.  Gave us great exposure.  Big Opie and Anthony sticker on his set.  Yeah, it's great.  A wow sticker.  A picture of Stalker Patty.  He did everything right for the show.  Fucking Jim Norton rules.  Just in case you missed it last night, we got the audio of Norton on Leno.  Okay?  As we go to break.  Patrice, you promoting anything?  Yeah.  What do you got?  Next week, I'm at.  You got it?  You do it, man.  What do I got?  I'm in D.C.?  Wow.  Look at the fucking headlines because Obama won the Nobel Peace Prize. 
[02:08:00]  There's a big thing on Drudge.  The front is him waving at the podium.  And underneath, it just says, for what?  With a question mark.  Obama wins Nobel Peace Prize.  Mixed reviews.  Quotes.  Embarrassing joke.  This makes a mockery of the Peace Prize.  Wow.  I'm raising my hand.  I was the first one, by the way, to voice my outrage at this just minutes after he was  actually young.  Anthony, you know what?  You turned me around, too.  Yes.  I agree with you. 
[02:08:30]  I need to know for what as well.  Give me a little dossier on what he did.  Right.  But this fucking, and we will give him the prize because he did this wonderful...  What did he do?  I don't know.  He flew Air Force One around the globe and apologized to everybody for the past eight years.  Well, what are they saying he did to win the Nobel Peace Prize?  It's this vague kind of, what they said was, it's this vagary of...  The first black president.  That's why he got it, baby.  Yeah.  Probably, yeah.  He's changing the perception of the world. 
[02:09:00]  He's changing the world.  Of the world.  And how it...  That was what it was.  There's not many...  There wasn't any shaking fucking Egyptian Jew hands on the White House fucking lawn.  There's not many awards you can win that just for being the first black president.  Except for feeling good.  You're the first black president.  He has a Nobel Peace Prize.  That's what he won.  Holy shit.  Here you go.  It's yours.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Obama.  Frank Perdue.  Same guy?  Same guy?  You think Frank Perdue was plucking those chickens?  That's what I'm getting at. 
[02:09:30]  Frank Perdue.  But when you think chicken, you think Frank Perdue.  But is he doing anything of the work?  He wasn't plucking the chickens.  He's Oral Niggerbonger.  Holy shit.  God damn.  What was the...  Oh my God.  What did Mars call Renee Zellweger yesterday?  I don't even want to say it.  Can I say...  Rebecca?  Do you mind if I say the N-word, Patrice?  It was Rebecca Swellnigger.  I'm not in charge of that.  That's what he said.  He called her Rebecca Swellnigger.  It was Renee Zellweger and we showed a picture of her and he goes, Rebecca Swellnigger? 
[02:10:00]  Is that Mars?  Yeah.  Yeah, Mars.  But coming from Mars.  I know.  It's coming from Mars.  He couldn't figure out anyone's name and that one had us fucking roaring.  You asshole.  Fucking A.  All right.  Here's the deal.  Patrice.  God damn it.  DC.  Go see Patrice.  DC Improv.  Someone was on the phone saying that some dude tried to kill himself at the DC Improv last 
[02:10:30]  week.  What?  Maybe that guy could call back after the break.  I don't know if it was a comic, somebody in the audience, but they had a big incident.  Supposedly.  I don't know.  Yeah.  Can you find out what happened?  Well, the guy couldn't wait around.  We went political for an hour.  I got a nice nap.  Jesus.  I got a nice nap in.  Patrice.  DC Improv.  The 16th.  Okay.  So next weekend.  Mm-hmm.  Next Friday, Saturday, and Sunday at the DC Improv.  I hope people come out.  I love fucking DC, man.  I love doing comedy there. 
[02:11:00]  Uh, Bananas and Poughkeepsie.  Yeah, the following week.  Big Mama Prods on Twitter.  Yes, sir.  Here's Jim Norton on Leno last night.  We had this guy on the show the first week.  Got terrific response from him.  No, well, from him and from people about it, actually.  Of course, his response was fantastic.  Of course.  He said I was great.  But he was great.  That's why I brought him back.  It's Jim Norton with the same we call Jim Norton Uninvited Guest.  Jim.  Thank you. 
[02:11:30]  Thanks, everybody.  How are you?  You know, it's funny.  I wasn't too sure what I was going to talk about tonight.  And then earlier this week, I found myself in a very weird argument with a guy.  It never ceases to amaze me what men can argue with each other about.  It could be anything from political ideologies to, hey, that measurement doesn't count.  You push the ruler too far into your stomach. 
[02:12:00]  I didn't expect that applause.  Apparently, I'm not the only guy who's ever lost a bet pulling that trick.  No, it was such a stupid argument.  We were fighting over whether or not fishing should be considered a sport.  Now, he was adamant.  Yes, it's a sport.  And I'm like, dude, come on.  You put on rubber pants and stand neck deep in the lake. 
[02:12:30]  You can't classify something as a sport if other people don't notice when you're urinating while you do it.  And an important thing to remember, I think, is for something to be a sport, don't all parties involved have to be aware that they're participating in a sporting event?  Fish have no idea.  They didn't join up for the team. 
[02:13:00]  They don't know they're in the playoffs.  They're hungry.  Fish have no idea.  They're hungry.  Picture yourself, one day you sit down at a diner, you take a bite out of your cheesecake, and then suddenly you're yanked violently through the diner window by King Kong holding a Bud Light.  Fish have no idea. 
[02:13:30]  I'm saying you're fooling the fish.  How good do you really feel about that? 
[02:14:00]  It's like outfoxing a shrub.  It's like what else do you do when you need to feel better about yourself?  Do you foot race a slug through salt or place the doku against an orangutan?  It's a fish, you idiot.  Fish are morons.  You ever catch a fish staring at you from inside the tank?  Look at that face. 
[02:14:30]  Yeah, I know.  Oh, it's adorable.  I love it, too.  But that's not the face of a creature who contemplates the mysteries of life.  You could own a fish for 10 years, and his expression wouldn't change if he saw you reading a book or being murdered with a hammer.  And this is when the guy really started to get angry, because he's like, no, no, no, you're not competing against the fish. 
[02:15:00]  You're competing against other fishermen.  I'm like, well, if that's the case, just leave the fish out of it.  How about you and the other idiot just stand across the pond and try to hook each other's eyes?  I would literally watch that for hours.  You hook the eye, it's 10 points, maybe the thumb webbing is 15, and you play until one man has 100 or somebody snags a testicle. 
[02:15:30]  Now, the worst form of fishing, the worst form of fishing I've ever seen is something called noodling.  You ever hear of noodling?  All right, well, that's good.  It's an actual thing they do.  They do it like in the swamplands and in the Ozark, and it's a form of catfishing where these lunatics will walk into muddy water,  and they take their fist, and they jam it into a mud hole under the water,  and they wait for a catfish to sink his teeth around their forearm, 
[02:16:00]  and then they pull the fish out and go, ta-da!  That's noodling.  There's a giant fish biting this man, and I can't decide who won.  It's like, how do we know that five seconds after that fish was taken,  the fish didn't just drag him under the water and start bragging that he caught a hillbilly? 
[02:16:30]  And my final point, and this is really further proof that fish are lovable, but they're just stupid.  I was watching a special on ice fishing,  and what ice fishermen will do is they cut a hole in the ice,  and they lower their line, and they wait for the fish to take the bait,  and then they just kind of reach down through the hole and pull the fish up out of the hole.  Now, as a fish, how stupid are you?  You spend the whole winter under the ice.  How does it not strike you as odd  that one day a perfect circle just appears, 
[02:17:00]  and delicious treats are dropped through it?  Look, I love delicious treats as much as anybody,  but I'd be highly suspicious if this ceiling opened up  and Megan Fox's ass fell through it.  Although, to be honest, I'd probably take a bite. 
[02:17:30]  Thanks a lot, everybody.  Good night.  Good night for Bass Pro Shops, ladies and gentlemen.  We've got to get right back into this.  Michio Kaku is on our phone lines, the great physicist.  Yes.  Who talks to us like we're children.  Well, you know something, we really are.  I mean, if we're going to blow up the moon, we've got to get an expert on our show.  We haven't blown up the moon. 
[02:18:00]  See, this is why he talks to us like children,  because he's saying we blew up the moon.  Are we going to talk to him or not?  Now there's a panic behind the scenes.  We sent a spent booster rocket into the moon to kick up a bunch of crap.  Yes.  So another probe following that booster rocket could take all kinds of readings  and see if there's any water or frozen water crystals in the cloud, in the plume, 
[02:18:30]  and then send that info back to Earth before that thing crashed into it.  Well, let's get him on the phone here.  Michio.  Hi.  Dr. Michio Kaku.  Hello.  You must have a very busy day.  Everybody wants to talk to you today, huh?  Okay, right, yeah.  Oh, nearly.  He's on TV now.  No, that's the other Asian guy.  Oh, sorry.  That's Sulu.  Michio Kaku.  Yes, right here.  Yes, sir.  Now, we were watching this probe, and it seems to be a success. 
[02:19:00]  Well, the actual shot was kind of disappointing.  We were all expecting a Hollywood-style money shot like Deep Impact to Armageddon.  Yes.  The next few hours, the spectrographic analysis will come in, and if they find evidence of water and ice,  that's a game-changer.  Yes.  That contains the entire space program if they find large quantities of ice on the South Pole.  This doesn't mean that we'd have to take a lot of resources to the moon with us.  Water can be used to make oxygen, to supply, obviously, water to people. 
[02:19:30]  Rocket fuel, too.  Rocket fuel.  And rocket fuel, the hydrogen from the water, can be used as rocket fuel.  Shut up.  That's crazy.  And you realize how expensive it is to bring water to the moon.  A pound of anything on the Earth would cost $50,000 to put it on the moon.  And imagine if it's a pound of Coke.  That's five times the cost of gold.  That's the price.  This is better than finding gold.  This is better than finding gold. 
[02:20:00]  If there's ice on the moon, right.  Because, you know, gold is only $10,000 a pound, roughly.  And it costs $50,000 to put a pound of anything on the Earth.  But you already know there's no ice and water on the moon, right?  You already know that.  Well, I think it's a long shot.  Let's be honest, sir.  You know that there's no ice and no water on the moon.  You know that.  It's a long shot.  A comet from billions of years ago may have slammed into the South Pole, where it's very cold.  And it's permanently covered by shadows and craters.  So there's a small chance, a small chance that you could have large deposits of ice. 
[02:20:30]  But it's a long shot.  And you don't believe that we even landed on the moon, right, sir?  No.  I think we've been on the moon.  Now, we physicists shine lasers off the moon.  There's a mirror left by the Apollo astronauts.  We bounce lasers off that mirror.  And then we can calculate the distance from the Earth to the moon within a few inches.  That's for fun.  So we use the moon program to calculate the distance from the Earth to the moon by lasers.  Now, can I ask you this?  Are there any universally known facts about the universe or about science that you completely dislike? 
[02:21:00]  Do you look at the theory of relativity and go, that idiot, son of a bitch.  Einstein was a dumbass.  Are there any theories by Hawking or anything that you go, this is ridiculous, I don't believe it, and it's dumb?  Well, the thing that really kind of upsets me when I read physics books is when they talk about a singularity where space and time break down, gravity is infinite. 
[02:21:30]  And so there's no such thing as singularities, you know, there's no such thing as infinite gravity.  I agree that.  But it seems that we don't know what's happening there.  That's also an excuse for our ignorance.  Now, let me ask you this, sir.  This is something I learned about space, and this is what I believe because it makes sense to me, is that space is not really empty.  It's more or less matter.  And let's say the sun is sitting in the middle of this matter, almost like if it's a stretched out sheet. 
[02:22:00]  Yes.  And the sun is in the middle, and if you put balls and coins or whatever, it's just going to roll towards the sun.  And that's what our planets are doing, are basically rolling towards the sun.  But the thing that's keeping them from rolling into the sun is the fact that they have their own weight that's pushing down on this dark matter.  Well, you know, I think that's very close to what Einstein said.  He said he beat you by 100 years.  Always trying to take something from a nigger. 
[02:22:30]  You don't get the E equals MC squared.  But I'm just saying, do you believe in that personally, sir?  Oh, yeah.  We actually measure that.  When we have dying stars, pulsars rotating into each other, space becomes like molasses.  And we can actually measure that.  In fact, the Nobel Prize was given a few years ago to physicists who calculated the fact that...  Somebody did something.  Yeah, that's a real Nobel Peace Prize.  Yes, a Nobel Prize for science, of course.  Have you personally discovered anything, sir?  Like, meaning, have you ever made up a theory that's pretty well known? 
[02:23:00]  My theory is called string field theory.  I work on something called string theory, and we want to summarize it into an equation one inch long.  That's my equation.  And we hope to test string theory with a $10 billion machine outside Geneva, Switzerland.  It's not going to blow up the earth, but it could prove that we all are made out of vibrating strings.  And that's what I do for a living.  I'm the co-founder of string field theory.  String field theory.  And what is the significance to layman's, like people who are just living life, if I find out that I'm just a big black string? 
[02:23:30]  Well, it means that we can read the mind of God.  I'm science.  See, scientists, this is your problem.  Sir, stop messing with God.  Scientists are the only scientists who can say the word God and not blush.  You know, you just, why don't you leave?  Here's what you can't explain.  This is what you're never able to do.  You're able to tell me what, like, how your heart beats. 
[02:24:00]  No, you're able to tell, like, your heart beats, right?  You're able to say, your heart beats, your heart, we live because our heart beats.  You give the cause.  But you don't know why or how your heart beats.  Like, it's just beating.  It beats by electricity.  It's an electric impulse that stimulates the heart and makes it beat.  We can make frog hearts beat by shooting electricity through frog hearts.  See?  Y'all really told God to kiss your ass.  Yeah, yeah.  Now, do you believe in God, sir? 
[02:24:30]  Hell no.  He doesn't.  Well, I'm just quoting from Einstein.  Einstein believed in a God of Spinoza, the God of harmony, beauty, elegance, simplicity,  that the universe was so gorgeous.  He was a Jedi.  It wasn't in an accident.  That's the God of Einstein.  Now, let me tell you, last question.  Well, maybe not the last one.  What is the most unexplainable thing?  Like, to me, the idea of the beginning, there has to be a place where you have to kind of chalk it up to God, 
[02:25:00]  meaning that even physicists go, man, my mind is not able to conceptualize that this is not God.  Like, is there anything that you go, man, this part is God?  Well, we believe in what is called the multiverse, that our universe is a soap bubble of some sort that's expanding,  but there are other soap bubbles out there, and we live in a bubble bath of universes,  where Big Bangs happen when bubbles collide, and bubbles fission in half,  and we're going to prove it in the coming years with a new satellite that NASA is launching in about five to eight years, 
[02:25:30]  and so we're going to prove that there was, in fact, something before the Big Bang,  something before Genesis, before Chapter 1, Verse 1 of Genesis,  and it was the multiverse, a multiverse of universes.  That is interesting.  Very interesting, Dr. Kaku.  But the God part is that the Big Bang, there was a something before the Big Bang.  Yeah, that's what he's saying.  That's right.  There were probably Big Bangs happening all the time, even as we speak. 
[02:26:00]  But there was a beginning, Dr., and that's God.  See, he's saying the ultimate beginning.  The ultimate bang.  Before the thing, before the Big Bang.  Before that, before that, there had to be a greater power that got it all rolling.  But who created the greater power?  Exactly.  It just appeared.  We don't know.  We physicists only deal with who we can measure.  See, that's it.  And we're going to be measuring radiation from the pre-Big Bang universe. 
[02:26:30]  It's not his job.  It's a new satellite to be launched in five to eight years.  Yeah, it's like asking a priest, you know, what about string theory?  He's going to be like, I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Well, we think the string theory is the ultimate theory, the final theory.  I like it.  The thing that eluded Einstein for three years.  My string theory is, you see a string, your sheets are getting dirty.  But that's just me, Dr. Kaku.  I know you have to go.  You only had ten minutes.  Anyway, read my book.  It's called Physics of the Impossible.  Have you ever saw?  Physics of the Impossible.  Wait, we got Danny once in real fast. 
[02:27:00]  Speaking of Physics of the Impossible, Dr. Kaku, when is that show going to air?  On Discovery or History?  On December, on the Science Channel.  Twelve episodes I'm hosting on teleportation, starship, warp drive, parallel universes, ray  guns, death stars, planet busters, everything you've ever wanted to know about Star Trek explained  in December on the Science Channel.  We will raise our psi-Qs.  Yes.  A quick question, actually, for Dr. Kaku.  Do you feel that if this Mars, excuse me, the moon mission is successful, do you think 
[02:27:30]  that will fuel any kind of speculation that maybe a probe to Europa might be sent out any  time within our lifetime?  Well, I think it would give added impetus to a probe to Europa, a moon of Jupiter, which  is covered with ice but may have an ocean underneath the ice.  And that ocean could be actually room temperature.  And there could be, who knows, sea monsters maybe swimming underneath the ice cover of  Europa.  That's a game-changer, too, because we thought you had to be close to the sun. 
[02:28:00]  Europa is ice-covered in the far away from the sun.  They just want to keep playing around.  Because it does seem like the technology does, in fact, exist for some kind of ice-melting  probe.  I know that the surface ice on Europa is probably miles thick, but it does seem like we're getting  close, if not already have, the technology to burrow through it and kind of get to the liquid  ocean under there.  That's right.  NASA has designed for a submarine, a submarine to put into the ocean of Europa.  Oh, cool.  That would be fucked up.  It's just a matter of cost.  These are very expensive probes.  Again, they cost maybe $50,000 to $100,000 a pound to put them up here to Jupiter. 
[02:28:30]  But, hey, that's nothing compared to the trillions being dumped into the economy right now.  Do you believe there's other people out there?  People.  Yeah, I think maybe not in our solar system, but I think in outer space, there probably are  people looking back at us, wondering whether or not there's any life on the Earth.  We're alone.  Probably no intelligent life on the Earth anyway.  Yeah.  And you think they're just the same thing as us, same societies and the whole thing, same  structure that they just, boom.  Well, we physicists believe that there are type 1, type 2, type 3 civilizations out in 
[02:29:00]  space.  Type 1 would be planetary.  Type 2 is stellar like Star Trek.  Type 3 would be Star Wars and galactic civilizations.  On that scale, we're type 0.  We're not even a planetary civilization yet.  So we're out of space.  There could be type 1, type 2, type 3 civilizations, perhaps 100,000 to a million years more advanced  than us, in fact.  Wow.  Yeah, until they get rid of things like Maury and, you know, Incense with the Stars. 
[02:29:30]  Do you ever say, we can't advance.  We'll be an Anthony show.  Exactly.  Come on.  Doctor, do you ever swear?  Like, if you discover something like amazing, like, you got to go, holy fuckballs.  E equals MC square up in this bitch.  You know, that's what we do.  We jump up and down the square.  I mean, when I discovered string field theory, I was just jumping up and down until like 5  o'clock in the morning, checking and rechecking all the equations to make sure that everything  worked out right.  It worked.  And it's one of the foundations of string theory now. 
[02:30:00]  Damn.  Did you celebrate with a little, like, champagne?  What do you do?  Well, we don't get drunk.  That's what we position.  He calls Stephen.  That's why they know what they know.  They don't go and get drunk.  He calls Stephen Hawking and said, take that, motherfucker.  I'll shove that in your piano, nigga.  I got you on that one.  I like how Dr. Michi Okaku described the whole moon thing we're doing today as a money shot.  You know what that term comes from, right, Dr. Michi Okaku? 
[02:30:30]  He knows.  It's from Hollywood.  Like in deep impact, the money shot in Manhattan gets covered with water.  It's a part of Hollywood.  We didn't see that money shot this time.  It's a very faint explosion on the boat.  He still doesn't understand where money shot comes from.  That's the porn industry, my friend.  They use the term money shot.  Do you laugh at things like Nostradamus and the end of the world theories, the 2012,  things like that?  Do you laugh at things like that?  Well, when I was a kid, I used to read everything about the paranormal, you know, Bigfoot and 
[02:31:00]  witches and demons and Nostradamus.  And then I got disillusioned because then I began to realize that Nostradamus in the  original is all metaphorical poetry.  You know, a dictator rises in the East, a nation rises in the West.  What the hell does that mean?  Nonsense.  And so 2012, this 2012 thing means nothing.  Anyway, as a kid, I began to figure out that a lot of the stuff that amazes people today,  if you really think about it, there's less than meets the eye. 
[02:31:30]  I think science is more fantastic than any fiction.  And so is in Transformers.  Yeah.  So the 2012 thing is all bullshit?  I think so.  If you look at the Mayan calendar, it's in cycles.  One cycle ends in 2012, but another cycle begins.  But I guess someone thought they could make a lot of money saying that the cycle ends  in 2012, but it's in the cycle begins.  Yeah.  And not bring up the new beginning one.  Yeah.  And do you notice every time there's a black president in a movie, it's the end of the 
[02:32:00]  world?  Danny Glover is the president in this movie 2012.  Can you believe that?  Can you effing believe that, Doctor?  Every deep impact.  Anytime there's a black president, it's the end of the world.  What's the other one?  Fifth Element.  Fifth Element had it.  Yep.  A big cross-eyed black president.  Yeah.  What's his name?  And it's the end of the damn world.  Oh, man.  That's amazing.  I love this.  I love Outer Space, man.  Yeah.  I love Outer Space.  Go to a planetarium, then.  I don't love it like that anymore. 
[02:32:30]  No?  You take a girl on a date.  Hey, do you have a girlfriend, dude?  I have a wife.  You have a wife?  Yeah, he's a married man.  Oh, my.  That's so curious to see, like, how...  Do you bore her, or is she also a physicist, too?  I don't mean that you're boring, but I mean...  I mean, you know, your life is...  It's what you...  I like to think you just married a waitress.  What you do is quite astruce, doctor.  It's very difficult to understand this stuff.  So, I mean, is your woman into it, too? 
[02:33:00]  Patrice is basically saying you must be a bore at a party.  I mean, no, but, I mean, he got a wife, and is she into the thing, too?  Into physics?  Well, you know, art and science are extremely close together.  Mathematics is almost like poetry.  And if you think about it, physicists are like artists, except instead of playing with paint,  we play with equations.  So, it's very creative.  It's very imaginative.  And...  So, you're saying you're a freak.  Don't let the numbers fool you.  Yeah, yeah. 
[02:33:30]  Meaning you're a lot more exciting than what people would imagine.  Oh, it's fantastic stuff.  You know, we're talking about the meaning of the universe.  We're talking about the ultimate constituents of matter.  We're talking about cracking the big one, the big equation that makes the whole universe go.  The ultimate theory.  I mean, what could be more exciting than that?  Hey, before we let you go, I mean, Ant and Patrice were going at it pretty good this morning about the Earth.  Are humans going to be able to figure this whole Earth thing out, or are we going to destroy ourselves? 
[02:34:00]  Well, I think it's a race against time.  I think in 100 years' time, there's going to be two trends in the world.  One trend is toward the creation of a planetary civilization.  That's called Type 1.  But on the other hand, we have the forces of chaos, global warming, nuclear proliferation.  And it's not clear which of the two forces will dominate.  But, yeah, there are two contending trends in the world right now.  And by 2100, I think it'll be settled as to whether or not we're going to have an age of Aquarius,  a Type 1 civilization, or whether we wind up in chaos. 
[02:34:30]  I seem to think humans are very adaptable.  I think if we run out of a resource, it forces us to use our noggins.  And the next generation does come up with a solution that the last generation created a problem for.  It's been that way since we've really crawled out of the woods.  And I don't think we can truly destroy ourselves or destroy this planet.  I think everything adapts.  And I truly believe that future generations have and will continue to fix the problems of the past generation. 
[02:35:00]  Well, I think the Earth will survive.  I'm not sure humans will survive, but the Earth will certainly survive.  Luckily, none of us are vampires.  We're going to be dead anyway.  Fifty years, I'm out of here.  What did Carlin say about that?  He said the Earth's going to be fine.  It's humans that are fucked.  Yeah, humans.  Something like that is a famous Carlin.  And do you think there's an afterlife, sir?  Is there anything that happens to us?  Oh, don't ask him this.  This is where it freaks everybody out.  Go ahead. 
[02:35:30]  Tell him.  Me too.  Well, I tend to think that there's no measurable evidence of a soul or an afterlife.  We know we scientists have looked for it.  We've tried to weigh the soul of the body before and after death.  We see no difference in the weight.  We see no reproducible evidence.  That doesn't mean it doesn't exist.  It just means it's not reproducible, not testable, not measurable, not falsifiable.  And he's a scientist, so he looks for that kind of proofing.  A spiritual thinking is something completely different. 
[02:36:00]  Do you have any unconventional non-physicist belief?  Do you believe in ghosts?  Do you believe in anything that do scary movies scary?  Do you believe in anything that's not scientific that you go, man, the rest of my colleagues would think I'm a fool?  Are you superstitious at all?  First of all, I love to see the movies.  I have a great time watching magic shows and ghost shows.  But my attitude is that I think we can reduce magic to physics. 
[02:36:30]  If he ruins all of the fun, this guy can't have fun.  I love it.  We need people like that.  I love this guy.  Just believe that the guy is making things appear.  Come on.  I think I'm quite reasonable, but I don't put hats on my bed.  You know what I mean?  I think I'm reasonably not superstitious.  I knock wood.  I knock wood if someone says something.  Excuse me, I've got to interrupt because we've got Stephen Hawking calling the show.  That's impossible.  No, I'm telling you.  Mr. Hawking, it's a pleasure. 
[02:37:00]  Okay, well, I've got to get off the phone now, guys.  It's been great being on the show.  All right, thank you, Dr. Kaku.  Thank you so much, Dr. Kaku.  He said, I'm not talking to that person.  He's like, I'm part of a bit now.  I'm done.  Interview over.  He's basically saying, do you really understand who I am?  I'm a scientist, you idiot.  I'm not going to be part of a shock, shock bit.  Yeah, here comes the bit.  I'm trying to figure out the fucking universe, and you're telling doody jokes.  Some guy with a wacky fucking little doctor. 
[02:37:30]  Fucking, hello, Dr. Kaku.  Hi.  You know you have the name cock in your name?  Cock, you get it?  Cock.  All right, I got to go.  Yeah, yeah.  One of the brightest human beings on the planet is sort of a friend of ours, and we're going  to ruin that, too.  Yeah, we'll destroy that fucking thing.  Now, who else is talking to that motherfucking thing?  Everybody today.  Oh, he's big today.  Yeah, this moon thing is big.  Oh, the moon thing. 
[02:38:00]  They're calling this guy up like crazy now.  All right, why don't we take another break?  We got to play a little catch up.  When we get back, fucking Patrice wants to let it out a little bit about this Letterman thing.  Yeah.  And this thing is still hot, so we're going to do that in a little bit.  Hey, what the fuck is the story with Dr. Phil?  Oh, let's get into Dr. Phil, too.  Yeah, because that's a little...  Let's get into all new shit.  Let's get into Australia and Dr. Phil.  Yeah, Australia.  And Australia with Blackface and Harry Connick Jr.  Not happy.  Clear the field.  Clear the field.  That's what we'll do.  We'll be back.  Hit it.  We got Patrice O'Neill in studio today. 
[02:38:30]  Let's not forget he's playing the improv in D.C.  The D.C. improv.  That guy never called back with a story.  That's weird.  Supposedly someone tried killing themselves at the D.C. improv.  I don't know if it's true, and I don't know if the D.C. improv wants us talking about it.  Eh, who knows?  That guy never called back, so who the fuck knows is right.  Patrice will be there next Friday, Saturday, and Sunday for everybody in the Washington, D.C. area.  Comedy can be changed to physics.  You take the joke apart with string theory. 
[02:39:00]  Boy, he is just a serious guy.  Serious all the time.  If he doesn't try to talk about anything, he'll just change it right into physics.  You think he loves physics?  He loves it.  He loves it.  So let's start with Letterman, Patrice.  Now I guess Letterman's wife's kind of pissed off is the latest news.  Because she wanted a public apology.  That's sort of what she was asking from David.  David Letterman.  Letterman and Letterman did do just that, but also turned it into an over-the-top, great, funny monologue. 
[02:39:30]  And now she has a real problem with that.  Doesn't she understand that he had to do it that way?  How else was he supposed to do it?  My issue, I was talking to Steve today.  The only thing I have a problem with, one, look, I have discussions with my girl about these things.  Women are going to have to understand that guys need side.  Like, we need that, or we need the idea of that somehow. 
[02:40:00]  Yeah.  To, like, say, Dave, I understand.  Like, just don't make me look like a fool, which is probably what she did because she knows.  I think that lady knows her role because of the way she looks.  I mean, well, it is offensive, but she is a fucking mess.  She is homely.  And Dave is not, like, some sexy dude.  He's 60-something years old, but he's a dude.  He's got the power behind him.  And like I said, I say this all the time.  You don't see a Tostagi's beer woman. 
[02:40:30]  You don't see an 80-year-old most interesting woman in the world with young guys.  Old women are finished.  Old men get to be cool dudes who just fucking have owls on their hands and they tell stories.  All right, wait.  I want to slow you down.  Why do you think that is?  Why can't the women be the ones that are the old broads with the young guys?  Because women have women's, their value.  Oh, God.  Oh, she looks like Mitch Hedberg. 
[02:41:00]  Oh, shit.  Now.  Look, I know what you're going to say.  Women, why this doesn't happen when they get older.  Men, and what women usually find attractive about men is very personality-based.  It's being funny.  It's being interesting.  Men don't get pussy because we have a dick.  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  Women get everything because they have a pussy.  And the vagina does not age as well as the men's personality. 
[02:41:30]  I can still stay interesting.  We can get wisdom as we get older.  We can get even more personality.  We can get more personality.  They can't get better pussies as they get older.  Where did that all start is what I'm getting at.  Why could the caveman name?  Ask that physicist.  So we go back to the caveman.  Why wasn't it the opposite way?  Here's what happened.  Hunter gatherer.  Here's what happened.  Break it down for us, Patrice.  The day in the year one.  Okay, whatever that is.  All right.  The year billion. 
[02:42:00]  The year rock.  The year rock.  It was probably just the year apple.  The year rock.  The year stream.  Whatever rock.  When the first, and imagine how great pussy had to be.  And this is pre-Brazilian waxes, pre-shaving.  Oh, man.  This was just a horrible, hairy mess.  Mess.  Barely finding it.  The first time.  Let's say this is.  Let's just say a number like 20,000.  Okay?  Years ago.  When guys found out that they would give up everything they have for that hairy mess.  Uh-huh.  That day, men have been striving to understand how to compete. 
[02:42:30]  Get that thing and not have to give up his rocks.  Uh-huh.  We say we were 20,000 years behind pussy.  Men have been elevating and stretching.  And women have been dismissing how much we're into pussy.  Uh-huh.  So they stayed the same since year one.  They've never changed.  They just go, a guy's going to give up all his money, all his rocks, all his fucking whatever the fuck is valuable at the time. 
[02:43:00]  Pelts.  And we've been trying to figure out how to change that.  Yeah.  And we've been doing a good job.  We're probably only 5,000 years behind pussy.  5,000 years behind pussy.  Only about 5,000 years.  We've been.  5,000 years to pussy.  We're getting there.  We're getting there.  We're still behind.  Is that on the Mayan calendar, too?  When we will reach pussy.  Oh, the year 5,012, nigga.  Pussy's finished. 
[02:43:30]  Is that why we invented gay?  Because we just gave up fucking chasing pussy.  Some guys gave up.  They just said, you know what?  I don't have time to catch up to pussy.  I talked to a gay guy, and he says he fucks a lot.  And he said it like with this.  I go, well, how does it?  What does that mean?  Yeah.  And all he did to explain, he goes, we're guys.  Gay guys fuck a lot because we're two men.  We just.  You get bored and you'll fuck.  You just.  You just be like, I'm bored.  What do you want to do? 
[02:44:00]  Two dudes is like.  Put your dick in my ass.  You know.  Anytime we have that feminine thing is we make it up.  So my thing is with her.  She probably knows her role.  She probably just said, listen, don't make me look like a fucking idiot.  Don't do it like this.  Now, Dave did the Kaiser Sosa thing, which you got to respect.  He said, nigga, really?  I'll kill myself before I let you.  Yeah, that's what he did.  Run my life.  Yeah, yeah.  And it was a smart thing.  And I know he talked to his girl before. 
[02:44:30]  He's like, look, baby, you know me.  She knows him.  You know what I'm saying.  Sometimes I stay.  He got a bedroom upstairs at the fucking Ed Sullivan Theater.  Yeah.  Where he's probably fucking these young broads and doing an Ed Sullivan impression.  Man, really, you like that?  Coming to my dick is the next intern.  You think they dismantled the bedroom by now?  Oh, that shit's still up there, nigga.  He pulls down a dictionary.  That shit turns around. 
[02:45:00]  Behind a secret fucking wall.  Alfred, his butler's there.  Making sure it's him.  So, basically, he fucked up a little bit.  But here's the thing that bothers me about women who are against Letterman on this issue.  She's been with the guy 29 years, right?  Okay?  And this woman.  And I'm trying to look at her and envision her young.  She was never hot.  Dave did this because he's been with her 29 years.  And she finally gave him a baby and all that shit. 
[02:45:30]  But I think that he did it because of how we are.  We're never faithful and we're never committed because of the girl.  It's something we do for us to see if we can be mature.  It's a maturity thing.  It's not like a I love you so much here's thing.  It's like, you know what, bitch?  You deserve marriage.  So, what he did, or the 29 years, he did it for her.  But my thing is with women who go, I deserve something for this 29 years.  It's the difference between investing in a house and investing in the stock market. 
[02:46:00]  Different investment.  When you invest in a house, you still live there.  That's your home.  It's value to you as you're living.  The stock market has no value until you cash in, really.  It's a gamble.  It's a thing.  Cash out.  You cash out.  Sorry about that.  So, what I'm saying is this bitch has been with Letterman for 29 years.  There's value in that.  Homely woman.  And the thing I keep saying this, ladies and gentlemen, is because it matters to men. 
[02:46:30]  How you look.  Your look as a woman is your value system almost a lot to a dude.  It's rare that a guy marries a woman because of all her other attributes.  It just is.  So, I'm saying that they think she should get some type of money or she gets some type of credit for being with Letterman for 29 years as if her fucking life has been foul for those 29 years. 
[02:47:00]  She's been living a lottery for 29 years.  Right.  And looking like that.  So, you know what, miss?  Shut the fuck.  Dave don't have to apologize for shit.  Shit.  Your life is the apology.  You should apologize to Dave for looking how you look and expecting the king.  There's only been a few kings of late night.  Mm-hmm.  One, Parr. 
[02:47:30]  Jack Parr.  Yeah.  Two, Milton Berle.  Not even late night.  That's prime time.  Yep.  Johnny Carson is the second.  He went through a few women.  Maybe Merv Griffin once in his motherfucking life.  Merv Griffin.  Exactly.  I'm trying to find somebody.  Don't mention Merv Griffin with Johnny Carson.  So, basically, Jack Parr in agreement.  Yeah.  Johnny Carson.  Right.  No black guys, by the way.  And David.  That's racism.  Well, Arsenio was okay for a minute.  He made a run at it. 
[02:48:00]  Arsenio had a minute.  Now we got Monique on BET.  Monique.  Monique.  Monique.  Hey, y'all.  Holla.  So, Magic Johnson did a good run.  Oh, my God.  Was that funny?  Fucking asshole.  Is this the gun guy?  Yeah, that's the gun guy.  Sneaky racist shit, you son of a bitch.  That's my 5'11 connection.  5'11 guy in the hayo.  So, it's only been three superhero motherfuckers in late night.  Dave is one of them.  And then maybe you put Leno. 
[02:48:30]  That's an argument.  But Dave is one of the top five greatest in what he does of all times.  And he's with this woman.  And this woman is not a top 1 billion of all time.  Nothing.  She's with Dave.  I don't give a fuck what you deliver.  My girl does a lot of shit for me.  But she pretty.  Yeah.  I'd fuck an ugly bitch that do shit for me.  That don't count.  Every ugly bitch want to do something for you.  If you got a million dollars, this chick is on the news looking like she looked. 
[02:49:00]  With that dead hair.  That dead gray black hair.  I'll never do Letterman again, evidently.  But I can't even explain it without offending anybody.  Lady, shut your mouth.  What he's doing is trying to protect you.  He's trying to protect you.  And he's taking all the brunt of what he did.  He's like, I fucked up.  He's not even saying, listen, this is what he could do.  He could go, look, bitch. 
[02:49:30]  You know the two million I was going to pay this nigga for extorting me?  I'll just give it to you.  And I'm going to tell you something.  Ladies and gentlemen, here's a box.  They put a box next to him of a picture of his wife.  And go, ladies and gentlemen, look.  You wouldn't get your dick sucked on the side?  Oh, shit.  Oh, God.  Who can blame me, nigga?  Nancy Grace, bitch.  You look.  You look better than her.  I fuck you.  Why you talking to me?  So, yeah, you're saying that Dave pretty much should be able to have, especially pre-marriage, 
[02:50:00]  whatever the fuck he wanted.  And why did he marry her?  I told you.  Fuck her.  But why is he doing her a favor?  Because dudes are like that, man.  If he's able to get all these women like that, and that's his thing.  Dudes are loyal.  Because pussy and loyalty are two different things, man.  That has, you know, if a woman, if your woman cheats on you, it's because of something you  did.  If my girl, my girl's fed up with me right now. 
[02:50:30]  If she went and got some side dick, it'd be because she's fed up with me.  Side pussy got nothing to do with her.  It's you.  Most women would argue that point.  If my girl goes, I'm going to fuck another dude, it's because it's, first of all, the  dude will go, you got a boyfriend, baby?  Yeah, but when?  You ask her, a woman goes, I'm going to fuck you.  You got a girlfriend?  Bitch, what the?  Can you not spoil this time?  Yes, we're very happy.  I'm getting ready to marry the bitch. 
[02:51:00]  Bitch, can you suck my dick and shut up?  Why the fuck you asking me questions about my life?  Don't spoil this.  Now, my girl fucking another dude, it's because it's an opening left that I made by her being  feeling inadequate about our relationship.  So she meet a guy and it's like, we're not having this and we're not, and she fucks.  And it's like, she has to convince herself based on it being her fucking against me. 
[02:51:30]  You feel me?  Right, yeah.  It's just like, look it, when a woman, we had this argument, dude, very recently, and  it's like, if I got caught cheating on her as opposed to she get caught cheating on me,  she get caught cheating on me, she gets demoted down back to hoe.  She gets demoted back down to where she began.  And where is she now?  She's, she's, she has, she's a five-star general. 
[02:52:00]  If this was an army.  She's the queen.  She's it.  Just about the queen.  There's nothing else.  Yeah.  She's, she's it.  If I don't marry my girl, I'm never getting married.  Right.  If I don't marry my girl that I'm with now, I'll never get married.  So yeah, she's like the queen.  She's it.  Okay.  And she goes back to lowly peasant girl.  She goes back, give me my keys.  All the way down.  But she doesn't have to.  I said, look, to stay in my life in any capacity, you'll now be a hoe again.  I'm taking my keys.  Bitch, you got a call.  And if you call, I'm not sure I'm going to call you back.  You got to go back to those days where you had to shut the fuck up. 
[02:52:30]  She said, if I get caught cheating, well, what if you get caught cheating?  I go, what do you demote me down to?  Oh my God.  Holy shit.  All you do is put me back where I want to be.  You being a hoe.  Either way, you back to being a hoe.  Are you writing this book or not?  Yeah.  You better be writing this book.  What if you're demoted to just out of her fucking life?  That's fair.  That's it.  But if we're going to be, if she, but see, that's what I said. 
[02:53:00]  She's either, either she's downgraded.  Then she's got to go.  Or she can go.  But then no matter what, she'll not have you and be out back in the scene being a hoe trying  to find somebody that's.  And here it goes back to caveman days.  I can find another woman that wants to be loved, that wants to be held, that wants money, that 
[02:53:30]  wants to call me every fucking second.  Where is she going to just go find love?  She can't.  She can't go, fuck you, nigga.  I'm going to find love.  No, you can get fucked.  She has to go find dick.  She's going to find dick.  And hopefully it turns into love, but it's still under my control.  That's why this.  All right.  Bring it back to Letterman.  Bring it back to Letterman.  And it didn't leave Letterman because I was going to wrap it up in a bow.  Here we go.  His, this woman that he's with married, she absolutely understands that she's been around 
[02:54:00]  for 29 years, not married to him.  And no other bitch, she's a soldier.  So he finally gave her a baby and finally married her.  And all she ever asked, all she ever asked.  Cause Letterman is a trooper.  You know, he's told these things is don't embarrass me.  Don't fucking embarrass me.  So she probably wants something like Dave, you're making.  Cause put it this way.  She's in Connecticut.  She has rich friends.  They keep up appearances.  They, she has to do things. 
[02:54:30]  So she doesn't look like a fucking fool at the Tupperware parties, man.  So it's like Dave has to go.  I'm so sorry, baby to her so that her friends can go.  She can go to her friends.  See, she knows that nigga getting his dick sucked up in there.  Fucking Ed Sullivan theater.  So what does Letterman lose in the end?  He, he loses liars from his fan base, but he gains a whole lot of dudes.  He gets dudes and more dudes that say, ah, fuck old Letterman. 
[02:55:00]  But now he getting his dick sucked.  And he said, he pulled the Kaiser Sosa where this pussy ass nigga tried to extort him.  And he says, you know what?  I'll destroy my whole family before I let you do that shit.  Dave is a dude now.  He's a gangster.  He's a dude.  Is he a gangster?  It depends on how he behaves.  Right.  Now, now if she says I'm done with this marriage, does David Letterman lose?  He loses money.  Well.  But he shouldn't.  He's got, he's got enough money though.  So does he really lose there? 
[02:55:30]  What does he lose?  I'm asking that question to you.  Hey, fucking.  Does he lose that love that he wants?  He doesn't want love.  He wants his dick sucked up in a, in a makeshift hidden bedroom.  You said it's different though.  My girl.  What if he really loves her?  He don't.  So he doesn't lose anything?  Not a thing.  What I lose with my girl is what men need.  I lose.  Like when we first date, when you first date, the pie is all pussy.  It's a pussy pie. 
[02:56:00]  Then you, you, you replace it with, you replace it with, with trust.  A little piece now is trust.  Then the trust part gets bigger.  The need part gets bigger.  The fucking, the, the, the thing where it's like, you know, you're my companion.  All that shit's get bigger.  The pussy pie gets smaller.  So this woman is, pussies left them, their relationship a long time ago.  As far as pussy goes, there's only a few crumbs left.  It's pussy crumbs.  So you can have an illustration and use a pie chart of, of what happens over the years 
[02:56:30]  where it's first, here's the key.  Red equals pussy.  And the whole fucking circle is just red at the beginning.  And then, okay, here's green is a trust.  It's a little sliver now in there.  It's, it's almost like, you know, um, Hispanics and blacks in my neighborhood.  That would be the little sliver.  But it's okay because you still have a lot of red.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[02:57:00]  So you're not even worried.  And those colors are contingent on what you need in your life.  So it's like, all I need from a bitch when I meet is some pussy.  You're adjusting.  I don't need that much trust.  A little sliver of trust is, hey, bitch, don't put the shit on Twitter.  Don't put the shit on my, you know, a little bit of trust.  But then it builds to be a relationship.  You're adjusting your pussy portfolio.  Yes.  You're diversifying your pussy.  Because you, you can't keep it all in pussy over the course of the relationship.  You got to diversify.  But I think that's what Patrice is trying to tell the guys. 
[02:57:30]  Make sure you make it mostly a pussy pie.  Keep all your assets in pussy because once you start diversifying and high risk things  like trust and relationship and companionship, that's when you get burned.  And that's when Dave married her is because her, she became so much more.  She probably knows really fucked up things about Dave.  He, he, she has level 12 clearance.  And I think other than the fact of physically what she looks like, I don't know what kind 
[02:58:00]  of person she was to Dave, but for 29 years, she'd been around, she'd been around.  So that means she's a fucking trooper to be around and not be married.  And that means Dave said, cause women are like, David, I don't have a child.  It's like, bitch, look, I've been married.  Go on, go fuck you.  So it's like you, you bring a bitch up in the crib.  They like, Oh my God, I'm going to marry him.  And you're like, I hear your voice, bitch.  I hear it in your head.  Here's what you're going to do.  You're going to enjoy my pool and you're going to go ask, keep the cop for a towel. 
[02:58:30]  I don't even know where they are.  And I don't, and that's what it is.  And that's how Letterman had her for 29 years.  My girl been around for nine years, man.  Nine, 10 years almost, man.  And I ain't marry her yet.  Dude, I marry my girl, man.  It's going to be for her.  It's just going to be because she put in.  You're fine with the way things are right now.  Like if it would stay like that forever, you wouldn't give a shit, right?  I'll introduce that bitch as my girlfriend when I'm 72. 
[02:59:00]  Right.  This is my girlfriend.  Yeah.  But for me, I know that for her, she can't take that shit.  Really?  Being a girlfriend for 27 years.  So I would marry her for her when it got to that place.  He did that.  That woman.  Wait, she understands that though.  And she's going to accept that knowing that you're just marrying her.  Because she doesn't want to really get mad.  She only, if I wrote a will, she'd be happy.  And said, all right, look, you got my shit.  If I die, you got my shit.  What about having a kid with you? 
[02:59:30]  Would that like satisfy her?  That would make her feel like I couldn't just bounce.  Right now, here's what it is.  Why does she stay with you?  Why does any woman stay with any guy?  I'm asking about you.  Why does she stay with you then?  Because we're, I mean, I've seen you guys together.  You're a really good couple.  We love each other.  Yeah.  Which is very different than what you say on the show.  But we're not together because of her.  Our relationship doesn't survive because of her reason and her logic. 
[03:00:00]  It survives because of mine.  If I was like her, we'd be finished.  So you have to have that logic.  I have to explain to her certain things that she feels.  Other women, a lot of women get married.  Look at how marriage is destroyed.  We've been together for a long time.  This bitch been around a long time.  It's still strong because I don't do things to resent her.  I don't do things that I don't want to do. 
[03:00:30]  If I don't feel like getting married, she wants to move in with me.  She keeps hinting about moving in.  I go, I'm not ready.  It's too small.  The house is too small.  I can't see you like this.  She pretty much lives there, though.  She can come in anytime she went.  The other day, she just popped right in because she's been feeling I've been cheating on her.  She feels it.  Because she calls and I might not call her back.  Or she texts her.  I don't text her right back.  And here's why I fucked up.  And I'll tell everybody this shit.  Trust has nothing to do whether you're trustworthy or not.  Trust is a routine that you stick with. 
[03:01:00]  If you switch your routine, your fucking trust is gone.  Trust level goes down, right.  So here's what I fucked up.  I started calling her and answering her texts immediately.  No matter what, I drop everything.  She's been feeling a little bit funny.  But it's not because of me, really.  It's because she might have gained a couple of pounds.  She's feeling a little...  Her mojo is a little low right now.  Her swagger.  So I've been trying to, in the last few months or two, just cater to her, the fact that she's feeling like that. 
[03:01:30]  But what that did was put me in a position to have to answer the fucking phone every time that bitch calls.  Now you, yeah, you set yourself up now.  So I set myself up with a bad routine.  So she came by the house.  She got the keys.  All I ever said to her was, don't ever drop in trying to catch me doing some shit.  I think the other day she dropped in to try to catch me doing some shit.  And I was just sitting in there holding my balls and watching whatever. 
[03:02:00]  And she come in there and you could feel her energy go, I feel better.  Because it was an odd time for her to drop in.  And you were just sitting there.  Just doing what I'm doing.  Innocent, Patrice.  Because I'm not greedy.  That's why I gave her a key.  So to keep me from thinking I'm going to have a bitch in there.  You're like an old school king, man.  Oh, God damn.  It's so intricate.  You might be the last king, man.  There's so many fucking facets to Patrice's relationship stuff. 
[03:02:30]  That whole thing with fucking, you know, the trust thing is routine.  It's not trust.  It's not trust.  It's just give somebody, the fact is, if I call you, man, you call me back every time.  I can hinge on that routine.  If you do some weird shit like, wait a minute, Anthony don't do overtime?  What kind of shit is that?  But now it has nothing to do with me being untrustworthy.  It just happened to be that.  You changed the routine.  But now there's a lack of trust, even though the trust tank is still full. 
[03:03:00]  Because the routine.  And I teach her, I tell her exactly what these things are so that I go, look, sweetie, I give you something to latch on to.  I give you a routine.  She texts me a couple of times.  And then here's what I did outside of the routine to help her out.  My phone wasn't working in L.A.  For some reason, AT&T was like, fuck L.A., you know?  I gave her the number to my motherfucking hotel room so she could just call my hotel room so she don't feel fucked up. 
[03:03:30]  Here you go.  That bitch.  Hotel.  Hello?  I think it's the maid.  Bitch, I said not today.  I'm just calling.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  It's just.  It's.  And that was the only reason she was calling to check up on her.  Yeah, but she won't.  You know, but look, man, I don't blame her, man.  I'm on the road.  I'm this and that.  I talk shit.  I don't blame her.  And I'm trying to, you know, appease that part of her. 
[03:04:00]  But the Letterman situation, this is.  See, cheating is not necessarily you have to go and fuck another woman.  And a lot of times that shit will help if you can just discuss it.  I know Letterman discussed it with her because she's been around.  Letterman thinks how I think and thinks how you think, Anthony.  Is that you if a chick is in your life, you're going to explain her and you're willing to have her walk out of your life based on your theory about not being unhappy anymore. 
[03:04:30]  Dave, it took him years to marry this woman, man.  And she knows he gets.  Because here's another thing.  You know how my girl.  It's two things.  You meet a girl who dresses like a hoe.  You meet a girl who was a hoe.  Now you with her.  I mean, let's understand that hoe is in the DNA.  Same thing with a nigga.  You meet me.  I had 12 bitches.  You know.  You know there's an affinity for me to want to have 12 bitches. 
[03:05:00]  So I'm fighting 12 bitches and you're fighting hoe.  Dave Letterman is fighting getting his dick sucked by young interns because she used to be one.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So she knows the animal she's dealing with.  They always think that they can change them, though.  See, that's the thing.  And you know what?  His goes back to the caveman shit.  Change them with what ability?  What did they learn?  The pussy.  The pussy.  I'm going to change it with pussy.  Really, bitch?  That's why we're still chasing the pussy.  We're still chasing it. 
[03:05:30]  5,000 years behind?  That's it?  5,000 years.  We'll figure it out.  We'll figure it out.  And I'm going to tell you what's going to take it back to where women are like the I Am Legend monsters.  If men just say I'm not, if men say I'm not fucking women, if we act with our dick, like women act with their pussy, if a girl goes, hi, how are you?  And you go, hi.  Can I buy you a drink?  I don't drink.  Well, do you have a girlfriend? 
[03:06:00]  Yes, I do.  And I just don't want to talk right now.  I'm just sitting here relaxing.  I want to be left alone.  Bitches will lose it because they have no skill to get dick without having a pussy.  I'm a fat motherfucker naked.  I'm telling you, I annoy myself.  I look at myself in the mirror and I go, why would a girl as pretty as my girl fuck me?  She's up to something.  That's because I'm thinking on my awful level.  Yeah. 
[03:06:30]  But at the end of the day, dude, I don't get pussy because of my physicality, man.  So if we could band together as men and hold on to totally swear off a pussy for a while and see where that goes.  It'll take 5,000 years for women to realize.  Yeah.  So we got to go 5,000 years.  I can't get no dick.  I can't get no dick.  Something wrong here.  Motherfuckers is holding on to dick.  Once they figure out men have come together and don't give up dick, they'll be in deep shit. 
[03:07:00]  Man rape will go right skyrocket.  Man rape.  Give me your balls, nigga.  I'm going to kill you.  That's a hell of a theory.  And then she took me under the staircase.  It was horrible.  She stuffed it in.  Just like, yeah.  Use her fingers and shove my limp cock inside there.  Pumped up and down.  What would a woman do to get, how the fuck would a woman get dick from you if, I mean,  if you wasn't willing to give it up?  Yeah. 
[03:07:30]  What would she do?  You know what she'd do?  Call you a faggot.  You must be gay.  If Rosario Dawson started rubbing the pussy and said, hey, fat boy, come in here.  And I'd go, nah.  You faggot.  What's wrong with you?  You're gay.  That's really?  Then you would prove you're not.  Then I would have, exactly.  What, bitch?  So now we have to be, we have to put up with that.  That insult.  There have been, there have been, there have been times you, you're laying in bed, you,  you want a little pussy or something like that.  And it's like, I'm tired. 
[03:08:00]  This and that.  And you got to go like, all right, whatever.  And, and then there are other times where you're fucking like, you know, she might rub  your leg a little bit and get things done.  You're like, you know, something I would love to, but I am fucking exhausted.  And you get like a, now there's a problem.  Who you been fucking?  Why is that?  What have you been doing?  It's not accepted.  But see, that's the, at the end of the day, here's it not to keep, but it's, it's a godly 
[03:08:30]  thing.  God has looked down favorably to men that he hasn't given us anything that makes us suffer.  The only thing that makes us suffer is the constant threat of other pussy.  When we're in a committed relationship, we don't have periods.  We don't have babies.  We have nothing that women should respect that we suffer with.  So when a woman wants dick and we go, no, she has the right to be suspicious, angry, rejected 
[03:09:00]  and mad because that's just, they don't believe in us.  But when a woman goes, I got a headache, I'm on my period, I'm having emotional issues.  We have to respect that as gospel, but there's nothing about us that they need to respect.  Like, all we are to them is dick, but really all they are to us is pussy.  You should stop there.  I was perfect.  Let's take a quick break. 
[03:09:30]  God damn.  The beauty of this show, we went from strength theory to the pussy pie theory.  Pussy pie.  Let me tell my theory on the pussy pie.  Take that, meet you, Kaku.  What do you know on the pussy pie theory?  By the way, quickly, since you're getting, we spoke about Dr. Kaku there for two seconds.  Dr. Steve, who we know loves Dr. Michio Kaku.  They have a little problem, right?  Oh my God.  Dr. Steve has a little problem with him.  He cannot stand him.  Dr. Steve was a physics guy before he became a doctor. 
[03:10:00]  He's a genius when it comes to physics and does not agree with Dr. Kaku on many things.  So he writes, now you know how to get Kaku off the phone.  Just start doing a bit like that.  He's involved with it.  He goes, that was hilarious.  He goes, in quote, a bubble bath of universes?  Shut the fuck up.  That's fantastic.  That's one physicist.  Shut the fuck up with your bubble fucking universe shit. 
[03:10:30]  It was better than my Dave Thomas theory, I'll tell you that much.  Dr. Steve rules.  The Colonel Sanders of the universe.  Shut the fuck up.  That's layman's terms.  Those are terms we can understand from a physicist.  Shut the fuck up.  Dr. Steve, the layman's physicist.  Yeah, that's Dr. Steve's shut the fuck up theory.  The sun's hot, nigga.  Quiet down.  Pipe down with your bubble bath space shit. 
[03:11:00]  The Jackson thing from Australia.  We gotta do it.  It'll be the last thing I think we do today after the break.  Aye, aye.  Patrice O'Neal is just a fucking funny dude, man.  I hope you guys know that by now.  Love it.  He's playing the improv next weekend.  Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.  The DC improv.  Big Mama prods on Twitter.  Yes.  You tweet that shit, right?  Yes, sir.  Where are you gonna be?  Yeah, I'm a tweeter.  Patrice O'Neal is just a fucking hysterical, and part of the fun is watching people first 
[03:11:30]  get the wrong impression that Patrice is actually...  I was watching his act, and it's great, because he'll fucking do some self-deprecating shit  at the beginning, and kind of bash guys, and the women are sitting there going, mm-hmm.  That's right.  Yeah, and they're looking at their boyfriends at the table, like, that's right, you hear  what he's saying?  You're just softening it up.  And then motherfucker turns around, and nothing any worse than he was saying about what assholes  guys are, on occasion, but then the same girls that were backing Patrice up are sitting there 
[03:12:00]  like, nose in the air, this motherfucker, I don't like that.  I don't like what he's saying.  It's so fucking funny to watch the audience at Patrice's show.  And do you make up half your shit as you go?  I always wanted to ask you that.  I make up...  Maybe I did ask you this.  What I do is if the crowd is beautiful, we make up half the shit.  I know that sounds a little hokey.  No, as a comic, that is so brave, to be able to just go out there and go, I think I'm  going to make half my shit up tonight. 
[03:12:30]  The people are very, very, very important, man.  The people.  They're a good crowd, dude.  You just want to give them more, and you can elaborate.  That's what we do at our radio show.  That's why this is successful, because we make our shit up as we go.  We're not following some dumb radio scripts.  A lot of comics do, though, unfortunately.  Follow some dumb comedy scripts.  I wouldn't be able to do comedy no more if I fucking, like...  I knew you, man.  If I'm like...  I mean, you got some ideas and stuff.  Yeah, I mean, I'm not going to...  And some go-to material if you're like, you know what?  The crowd's not...  I'm not feeling these guys tonight.  If the crowd ain't beautiful, then I'm like...  Then you got to go to your stuff. 
[03:13:00]  E equals MC squared, nigga.  There's comedy theories.  They're going to need some bubble bath fucking...  There's bubbles, Chris.  Pluto has made a bubble.  Steven S. Trebeshore said, I'm wrong.  You're actually on Twigger, not Twitter.  Oh, no.  Come on.  That doesn't even...  We're all starting to get along today.  Son of a bitch.  Oh, my God.  You can't even have an open discussion without...  Can we all just get along today?  I ate fish with Steve from Babeshow.  That piece of garbage.  That motherfucker.  Look at him.  He's probably feeling bad.  That was funny, Steve. 
[03:13:30]  Don't worry.  Fuck him.  It was all right.  It was all right.  Fuck him, the Nazi.  Piece of shit.  All right.  One more break to do.  Bobo's here today.  Bobo is here today, too.  I don't know.  I got an idea with him.  I noticed something about him, but we might not have time.  Maybe we'll end with Bobo.  It'll only take like five or ten minutes.  It's better.  It's Friday, motherfucker.  Explore my idea.  Something I pick up on.  It better is Friday.  Yeah, we want out.  Quick.  Patrice O'Neal.  It's his show today.  We'll be back.  All right.  Let's go. 
[03:14:00]  Patrice O'Neal in studio.  The 5'11 guy.  And the fourth attempt at my oatmeal has arrived.  I think it's good now.  You think it's good, Danny?  Yeah.  That's how I eat my oatmeal.  I asked for oatmeal.  It came back like a milky mess.  So I said, hey, you know, I need another oatmeal.  I need it dry, meaning you don't pour the milk on the oatmeal after they prepare it.  Yeah.  So this Evan dummy that's been working with us for way too long should be shown the fucking door. 
[03:14:30]  Oh, my God.  He's not even laughing at that.  Comes back with dry oatmeal.  That's nothing in it.  As in you pour it out of the thing to cook.  Like granola?  Who eats that?  The pour.  How do I eat dry oatmeal?  Yeah, just take Patrice's microphone.  Very nice, by the way.  How do I eat dry oatmeal?  For real.  I got you your first oatmeal.  Yeah.  Like I usually get it.  I just ask for oatmeal with everything.  There was milk in it, right?  Yeah. 
[03:15:00]  Look who comes in.  Look who goes.  Sam does nice too.  You guys made him dress up?  Sam did that.  These guys do things behind the scenes and they're hoping we acknowledge it and we're just not  gonna.  So don't acknowledge that they're all dressed up and nice today.  It's some weird thing Sam's doing behind the scenes that I don't really feel like getting  into.  So you did this for no reason, by the way.  Which makes Sam very happy.  It makes Sam very happy.  Yeah, Sam just pulls these things for no fucking reason.  Yeah, we noticed that you got a tie on and everyone's clean cut today.  But you know what?  I don't feel like going with the bit.  Sorry.  We got Patrice O'Neill talking about relationships and cavemen and we got string theories and 
[03:15:30]  fucking apple pie theories and whatnot.  So pussy pies.  Pussy pie.  Right.  So why would you come back with dry oatmeal?  I didn't get the subsequent oatmeal.  You said your first one.  Why does he talk like that?  Who came back with the actual dry oatmeal?  When I mean dry, it's right out of the box.  Yeah, yeah.  It's not even cooked.  No.  Or anything.  It's just dry oatmeal.  Who came back with that?  I mean, I don't want to point any fingers, but I believe Kenny's replacement, Chris, 
[03:16:00]  was responsible for that one.  Uh-oh.  It's like it came out of a grain silo.  That's where your oatmeal came from.  Fresh out of the silo.  Unbelievable.  We don't need to spend a lot of time on my oatmeal.  It's just bizarre because now we're...  Oatmeal diva!  I know.  I'm up to the fourth version of this.  Why don't you just wait till we're off?  At this point...  Get it yourself.  Exactly.  Now it's like, fuck it.  Everything falls apart when Kenny's not here.  Do you realize...  And now Kenny's going to know that, and now I've got to deal with an email. 
[03:16:30]  I'm so sorry that because of my absence, everything got fucked up today, GH.  But now this is my proprietary mix.  I like it.  So I need to know if it's okay.  I like the combo.  It's very nice.  Have you noticed something, by the way, since Kenny hasn't been here?  What?  Past two days?  What?  What?  Have you noticed something here?  What?  What are you missing?  Sandwich?  I haven't eaten in two days.  In two days.  Because I just know it'll get fucked up and I'll get pissed. 
[03:17:00]  So I'd rather just starve and wait till I get home.  And people always ask us, why?  Because Kenny just does things right every single fucking time.  And it's no bash against anybody.  Believe me.  Because it's just...  For me, going out and getting food is a problem because people are morons at the stores.  We can't.  We have to be here the whole time.  And Kenny just knows...  We barely have time to fucking take a leak.  So what I usually get is the toasted onion bagel.  It's got to be toasted right. 
[03:17:30]  And then the turkey with a slice of American cheese melted on top of it.  And then that whole thing heated, placed in the fucking bagel, and then wrapped up and brought in.  And it's fine.  Anyone could do that.  But then again, I thought that about the whole thing.  No, because sometimes I've gotten...  Which could be the easiest thing to prepare for breakfast.  A cold turkey sandwich.  Yeah.  I've gotten an everything bagel with just a regular cold turkey and eight slices of fucking cheese.  Right. 
[03:18:00]  You know, it sounds like diva.  But to me, I thought to myself, why get annoyed?  I'm not even going to eat until Kenny comes back.  He's coming back Monday.  You're going to starve all weekend?  I'll starve.  I won't even eat at home.  I'm going to wait until Kenny gets back.  No, I go home and I pig out at home.  But I don't...  Because I don't have to eat while I'm here.  It's comfortable and very tasty.  Right.  But I'm like, you know, if it's going to be a problem, fuck it.  I made a video with Kenny's replacement yesterday. 
[03:18:30]  I kind of like this one.  Yeah.  I'm not going to promote all my videos, but that one I kind of like.  Yeah, good one.  Yeah, because I wanted to play you drop something with the guy.  And I needed to know the password because Kenny told me not to get in any stranger's cars unless they know the password.  So I was really fucking...  Like a child.  Like a child.  And then I had to ask him to make sure he wasn't going to touch my wee-wee.  Did he?  And he was so fucking annoyed with me.  Of course he is.  He's not Kenny.  He's not Kenny.  He doesn't have that dopey Kenny.  He didn't talk with dice for fucking ever.  So the video is very uncomfortable if you want to check it out on TV radio on YouTube. 
[03:19:00]  Evan, get out of here.  Thank you.  Thanks for your efforts.  I appreciate it.  Whatever you do.  Sam.  Whatever you do.  No, actually, talking of food, I guess behind the scenes, all hell is breaking loose, Anthony.  Yeah, there's things going on.  I heard a discussion.  And I want to make it perfectly clear that me and Ant are bringing this to the air.  Because these guys actually said, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.  Don't do this.  No, no, no.  We go to the air.  Blah, blah, blah.  We go to the air.  Yep.  What's going on?  Oh, we said that E-Rock takes pictures of Steve's breakfast every morning, right? 
[03:19:30]  Yes.  E-Rock, you've been doing that for a while.  Yeah, for months now.  Yeah, I know.  I've seen your pics on your Twitter.  And they're quite hefty breakfasts.  And it's just funny.  I mean, if you're going to use Twitter, that's the way to use it.  Yeah.  Humiliate somebody.  That's what it's there for.  But he wasn't aware you were doing this?  Well, he knew earlier on that after the first time, I guess we mentioned that on the air that  we were taking photos of his breakfast.  But he said, and I sat there quietly. 
[03:20:00]  Another guy that doesn't like us just walked by.  I know.  I know.  I understand.  I understand.  Oh, that one?  Fucking two bucks.  Go ahead, E-Rock.  I thought you were being anti-Semitic.  I'm fucking sick of the dirty looks we get when people walk by our studio.  I really did think he said jukebox.  I know.  Something.  Juke.  I was like, what is that?  Jukebox.  People make their living by just fucking, you know, one song after another.  And they're giving us dirty looks as they walk by the studio.  I get it.  I understand. 
[03:20:30]  I get it.  Go ahead, E-Rock.  So, back to you.  So, yeah, he was aware of this.  And he never said not to in the past, right?  So, we kept, oh, I kept doing it.  And today just set him off because he said, I've put up with this long enough.  I'm tired of this.  And when this segment was done, I walked back to the office.  Well, the picture was, what?  Some kind of omelet with a lot of ketchup.  A lot of ketchup.  A whole thing of fries.  I would probably, honestly, feed a family of four as a side dish. 
[03:21:00]  Fries and eggs.  And then some kind of, like, chicken.  Chicken with lettuce.  But there's a giant blue cheese.  Like, the chicken and lettuce would be fine.  That should be the breakfast.  The chicken and the lettuce without the big packet of cheese dressing.  All those three together.  Who makes fries for breakfast, though?  Like, who even, who even find a restaurant that'll, that'll, that'll put on the fucking  fryer in the morning?  Fucking fries.  He's on some kind of weird diet. 
[03:21:30]  Hmm?  Exactly.  I didn't, I didn't make the look, Steve.  Don't worry.  E-Rock.  So, I go, I go back to the office.  And I said, I looked at Steve, and he wasn't looking at me.  By the way, it was a good bit for the show.  And that's all, I, I explained this to E-Rock.  I go, that's all I care about in the end, is a good fucking radio show.  You know, I can't be bothered with whose fucking feelings I heard on a given day.  I want to look.  We all take a turn, you know, under the bus.  I want to look at the clock and see that 40 quality minutes just went by. 
[03:22:00]  Yeah.  And that, to me, is like, ah, we're doing our job.  You know how uncomfortable I felt with my Dave Thomas theory?  Of course.  I fucking ate a shit sandwich this morning, okay?  I know it was.  I know!  Trying to show I'm smart by doing my Dave Thomas theory.  Oof.  You don't think I heated up inside?  A little, a little warm?  Yeah.  And that's what this show's about.  I could care less if feelings are being hurt.  Anyway, E-Rock.  So, I walk in.  He's not looking at me.  So, I kind of pat him on the back.  I said, hey, sorry, Steve. 
[03:22:30]  And he says, don't fucking talk to me.  Oh, boy.  Don't fucking look at me.  Stay the fuck away from me.  That he had it.  So, I go, okay.  Is he looking in a mirror at the time?  Just self-loathing?  I, nigh.  I, nigh.  I, nigh.  Jesus.  Well, whatever.  Anyway.  See, but that's, well, whatever.  Yeah.  So, he said all that to you.  So, he said that, and I go, come on, Steve. 
[03:23:00]  And he goes, no, I'm fucking tired of this.  I said, but I've been doing this for a long time, and you know that I've been doing this.  And he said, I've kept my mouth shut, and I'm not going to.  Not in the morning.  Not.  With all that.  And he's not going to.  I, nigh.  I, nigh.  I, nigh.  Jesus.  Sorry.  Continue, E-Rock.  And, uh, he's not going to stand for this anymore.  So, I said, okay, okay.  Wait, can I stop you for a second?  And this is the point I was making to E-Rock during the commercials. 
[03:23:30]  Steve's saying that to E-Rock, who ate the biggest shit sandwich of the week with that virus bit.  Oh.  So, so he had no problem when you were under the bus, right?  Taking a lot of shit from a lot of people.  Well, he said he felt bad, but, you know, that's, that's where it's like.  But it wasn't him.  Once it's him, then that's when the problem occurs.  He doesn't like to be goofed on whatsoever.  He said he felt bad.  He understood why I was upset.  But, you know, what else was he going to do?  Right, okay.  So.  I didn't, quite frankly.  I really didn't understand why you were upset. 
[03:24:00]  It was a funny bit.  Yeah, we like it.  It's like a funny, yeah, it's funny.  We do like the virus bit.  So, Steve's really upset.  So, I go, okay, just get the fuck away from me.  So, I walk out of the office.  And I walk into the second office where Sam is sitting.  And you were still near him.  Yeah.  Well.  Oh, Ed.  I, nigh, nigh, nigh, nigh, nigh, nigh.  Maybe he's just super sensitive because that probe crashed into him earlier this morning.  Oh, oh, nigh, nigh, nigh, nigh, nigh. 
[03:24:30]  Did they find water or what?  I found French fry oil.  Oh, man.  What are you doing?  I, nigh, nigh, nigh.  Jeez, Ed, come on.  Come on.  Okay.  Sorry.  Where's Ozo when you need him?  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  So, he says, get the fuck away from me.  So, I leave the office and head into Sam's office.  Which Steve then follows me into Sam's office.  And I sit down and he continues going after me, screaming at me, saying, you know, fuck 
[03:25:00]  me.  All the favors that he's done.  Oh, boy.  And, you know, don't expect me to help you out with all this other shit anymore.  I'm tired of this stuff.  You better pick a side.  I know.  Pick a side?  And I'm like, Steve, I'm trying to tell him this wasn't as bad as he's making this.  You know?  Because out of everybody, I pick on him the least.  And what I do to him is hardly really bad considering what he gets on a daily basis.  What side, though?  Wait a minute.  Wait, with this fucking side being chosen?  What did he mean?  Well, maybe he meant Eastern and Western Hemisphere. 
[03:25:30]  What side?  Are there teams here?  Oh, come on.  We all know there's teams, Sam.  Let's like...  Oh, no.  I know that.  I just want someone to say it.  We all secretly acknowledge that.  I mean, come on.  But somehow it works.  Split right down the middle to it.  The Jets and the Sharks.  That's the beauty of this show.  It's pretty much split right down the middle.  But what about Steve?  That's the problem.  He's not on one of the sides.  It's his own side.  There's a Team Anthony. 
[03:26:00]  There's a Team Opie.  But then they all...  But then everyone gets along.  But Steve doesn't feel like he's part of a team.  So it's like the whole show's on one side of a seesaw.  He's on the other and it's level.  I nigh.  I nigh.  I nigh.  I nigh.  And that's just based on...  We just get along with members of the staff better than others.  I don't hate anyone on the staff, to be honest with you.  I think geographically certain things work out better than others.  I don't hate anyone.  Perhaps if Sam lived a little closer to me, he'd be my little twink friend. 
[03:26:30]  Yay!  Yeah.  Instead of Opie's flunky.  Oh, yay!  And if Danny didn't live in Queens, hop, skip, and a jump to my house, perhaps we wouldn't  black out drunk together.  Well, on the weekends.  There is free beer, so I'd probably make the trip.  How many...  For these teams, how many guys work here?  I know.  I only know, like, three.  I don't think that's even what Steve's talking about.  No, no. 
[03:27:00]  What is Steve referencing?  Wait, Sam's on it.  Let's go.  Steve thinks there's...  Look at Sam, makes me think he's a smarmy little douche.  He really is.  He put his head down like a, well, I'm sorry to have to say this, but...  But they're asking.  Meanwhile, he's happy as a pig and shit to mix this up.  He's chomping at the bit.  He can't wait to get on mic.  Mix it up, you little prick.  Go ahead.  You guys are confused.  You're describing the Opie team and Anthony teams.  Those are the on-air teams, not the behind-the-scenes teams.  Now there's a behind-the-scenes team, which is...  Well, I mean, there's... 
[03:27:30]  There's a documented rift between Steve and Danny, so I would assume...  Well, we know that.  I would assume that it would be Team Steve and Team Danny back there.  So I think those were...  That was the team...  Is there members of Team Steve, though?  Behind the scenes?  Holy shit!  Is there anyone on Team Steve?  I think Steve felt that Eric was a member of Team Steve, and when Eric did what he did 
[03:28:00]  on the air, Steve felt he was maybe leaning over towards Team Danny, although...  Since Eric also hates Danny, I doubt he's on that team, too.  So how did that happen?  I don't think they hate each other that much.  Steve seems very nice to me.  What does he do to have this more?  He doesn't want to be part of the fun.  Maybe I don't have to deal with it, like, because I just come here to talk shit, but...  So he followed you and started yelling and screaming?  Sam, you saw this?  Yeah.  And you're saying Steve is...  Look at Sam! 
[03:28:30]  And you're saying Steve is way out of line?  Steve's a party pooper?  There was other people that witnessed this, too, out in the hallway.  Yeah.  Uh-oh.  I'm saying Steve was a bit over the top.  He kept yelling at Eric and said that...  Can Steve fire anybody?  No.  No.  Is he somebody's boss?  No.  To be completely honest, if there's a lot of honesty today, he can't fire shit.  Oh, jeez.  You can't?  Steve's a figurehead.  I thought Steve could fire people. 
[03:29:00]  Steve's a figurehead.  He's my superior.  What?  Definitely.  Shut up.  He is.  He can't fire anyone.  Steve can fire you?  I mean...  I know he can suspend you.  Okay, Dan.  Oh!  Oh!  I, nigh.  I, nigh.  I, nigh.  He can write reports on people.  No, people have...  To get to who?  Patrice.  To get to the next level boss up.  No, no.  It ain't happening.  Here's the deal with this place.  A lot of people have, like, fake titles, but in the end, Ant and I run the entire company. 
[03:29:30]  Yeah, we run the whole company, actually.  For real.  No one's getting fired without our say.  Don't make me go upstairs.  Steve can't fire anyone.  No.  I mean, Opie's the main boss.  He could suggest...  Hey, what about Anthony?  I mean, Opie's...  That was because of a team Opie thing.  I know, because he's team Opie.  He just happened to be the one who was speaking.  Danny would say you're the boss.  It works out, yeah.  Opie was just the one speaking at the time.  I hear you.  If you had said that, I would have said Anthony's the main boss.  So there's no worry.  And is this why Steve is not here right now? 
[03:30:00]  I don't know why he hasn't...  No, but while Steve was yelling at Eric...  He could suggest...  I'll be fair.  He could suggest a firing.  But in the end, it's up to Ant and I who gets fired.  But if that's the case, everybody can suggest a firing.  Of course!  That's what I'm saying.  And then there's other bosses that are higher than...  But Janet can suggest a firing.  Then there's other bosses that are higher than Steve that think they have power.  It's a whole joke.  He's the eunuch producer.  He's like a eunuch.  I nigh.  I nigh.  I nigh. 
[03:30:30]  Steve said he preferred to keep his head down and remain off the air.  Head down into the plate of fucking French.  No, it's...  To a tron.  I nigh.  I nigh.  I nigh.  Oh, my God.  It's just brutal.  Why is it brutal?  It's so brutal, man.  It's what happens in every fucking workplace.  I guess you're right.  You're just talking about it.  Steve prefers to do what his job is.  You know, booking guests and making the proper phone calls and e-mails, but remain off the air. 
[03:31:00]  Why do you say that with a smile, Sam?  I'm happy to be here.  I'm at the Opie and Anthony show.  You know, it's a good day for me every day.  Okay, so Steve will not be joining us on the air for this discussion?  I, frankly, I highly doubt it.  You know, the person who would be pissed off by that the most would be Jimmy.  Norton would be losing his fucking ass.  You tell him to get his fucking ass in here.  It's about a fucking show.  It's for the show, you fucking asshole.  That's what Jimmy would be saying. 
[03:31:30]  He'd be very angry.  But that's Steve's prerogative.  You know.  I'm hurt for Steve because I...  Yeah?  I know that Steve has to think that he's higher than these guys.  Yeah?  You would have to feel like he thinks he can more than suggest things.  No.  No.  No.  No.  If Steve tells me what to do, I always do it.  He is superior.  See, if something happens off the air, if there's an argument or some discussion off the air that is, you know, kind of nasty, 
[03:32:00]  then he could write, file a little report about the person.  And who gets it?  You?  No.  We wouldn't see it.  What are you, I'm going to look at a fucking report?  No.  We'd get knocked upstairs.  Someone's asking about Roland because we said that no one gets fired without our approval.  Roland didn't work for...  No, no.  He didn't work for the show.  He worked for another company that kind of...  He subcontracted.  ...kind of strong-armed the company, CBS, to not, you know, continue with Roland. 
[03:32:30]  He was a subcontractor.  He didn't want to wait too much money.  And we're still, we're trying to get Roland hired here.  But, uh, yeah.  Kind of a different situation, to be honest with you.  No, there have just been, you know, things.  Oh, that's so funny.  Steve said Eric was kicking him in the dick.  Oh, yeah.  You're kicking me in the dick.  He's like, how many times are you going to keep kicking me in the dick?  Wow.  Because of his breakfast?  Apparently, yeah.  You know what show he works for?  No.  This is easy stuff.  That's a hilarious breakfast, though. 
[03:33:00]  This is easy stuff.  It's a funny-ass breakfast.  Something's going on deeper than this, because this breakfast, he...  That's easy.  This is breakfast.  Dude, when you order a watermelon, what's the first thing we do?  We make fun of you.  Yeah.  Who can get...  Here's the thing.  Here's the funny part.  Who can get chicken, french fries, and eggs at breakfast time?  That's very resourceful.  It's a hilarious breakfast with blue cheese.  It's a weird breakfast.  It doesn't really make sense.  It doesn't make any sense, that breakfast.  Why is he so ashamed of this breakfast?  Why he brings it from home? 
[03:33:30]  Oh, he brings it from home.  Yeah, it's deeper than that.  Patrice is absolutely right, because we all get smashed on this show.  Oh, but he shouldn't be so hurt about this.  Something's...  No, no.  It's deeper.  This is some type of posthumous breakfast that he dedicates to somebody...  Look at that breakfast.  ...that's not around anymore.  Look at that fucking breakfast.  Two giant cheeseburgers.  Look at the angry bite marks.  Look at how those bite marks are like Velociraptor.  Yeah, like a Velociraptor got it.  Why wouldn't...  First of all, I wouldn't...  Every morning...  Here's the genius of Eric right now. 
[03:34:00]  Every morning I would look at that and go, what the fuck?  Who are you, man versus food, niggas?  I think food's winning.  For the record, Patrice, a big guy, is laughing at all the fat jokes, okay?  Because that's all it is.  Why is he upset about this?  He's eating two hamburgers for breakfast.  There's a lot of that in the box.  And we're not supposed to comment about that?  I believe he feels he is shat upon more than other people. 
[03:34:30]  Steve is not even close.  The only shitting, I would say...  Not even close.  I'll tell you right now.  As a fan of the show...  E-Rock gets shit on twice as much.  And that's why it's so weird that Steve goes after E-Rock, understand what E-Rock takes  on a daily basis from this radio show.  As a person who's a fan, and as a person who comes through, I'm not here all the time.  Yeah.  But from what I...  Thank God.  And from what I understand...  I'd be a silent partner by Tuesday.  Eric gets fucked with a lot.  Yes.  Sam gets fucked with none. 
[03:35:00]  Barely none.  Well, because he postured...  Danny barely gets fucked with.  Danny doesn't get fucked with.  And Travis...  Travis gets fucked with because he's a blue bitch.  Dude, that's not true.  He's a skinny little girl bitch that's a homosexual that married a girl just to prove that he wasn't  homo, but he is, and his child isn't his.  Why do you keep kicking me in the dick, man?  I think the only thing Steve has is the gay voice thing is his only...  Yes.  Now he has...  Now he's got breakfast.  Now he has food. 
[03:35:30]  Now he's got breakfast.  Sam doesn't get fucked with that much because he's a little smarmy motherfucker who could  turn it right around.  Danny doesn't get fucked with as much on the air because he just turns around and goes,  go fuck yourself.  And it's the end of the story.  Like, hey, fuck you.  And it's over.  You know what?  That's not fair.  You're simplifying it.  Everyone gets fucked with.  They really do.  But my point is Steve does not get a whole lot of nothing except for the Steve voice. 
[03:36:00]  Right.  Yes.  That's it.  That's funny.  But now he has the gay voice.  Now he's the gay voice who eats two cheeseburgers.  Cheeseburgers.  Giant fucking bites out of cheeseburgers.  And here's how big they are.  They don't fit in the thing.  I know they don't.  So he ate them for them to fit in the thing.  He had to take three gigantic bites so it fits in the fucking plastic container. 
[03:36:30]  Because two won't fit.  One and a half fit.  How can he be so fucking upset about this?  I want to know.  Can you get them?  When he bought these, did he tell the guy he'll gladly pay them Tuesday for those today?  I nigh.  I nigh.  I nigh.  I nigh.  Where's Steve, man?  Can we talk to Steve, please?  I don't make fun of this.  I just want to know what's going on.  Why the fuck is he so upset about this?  Let's get Steve in here and settle this.  Steve, I think he can't be upset about this. 
[03:37:00]  It's a giant, it's a half-eaten giant burger and a full giant burger.  Steve, come on down here and explain.  It was an omelet, french fries, and a chicken salad.  Yeah.  For breakfast.  Yeah.  We got to, you know, it's got to be discussed.  Why wouldn't we discuss that?  That he brings from home.  He made two big sandwiches?  Did he make these at the house?  That he bought for breakfast?  Cooking up cheeseburgers at four in the morning, three in the morning, putting them in tubbyware. 
[03:37:30]  And trust me, this is not a diet.  I don't like food that much to cook at four in the morning.  No.  If there were two hamburgers with no bun, I would say, okay, he's doing some Atkins, but  the french fries fucked it up.  So, Iraq, how did it end?  Well, that was sort of the end of the first fight.  He left the second office and went back into our office and just wasn't talking at all.  Then, during one of the commercial breaks, I'm down here, and I'm talking with Sam about 
[03:38:00]  doing something for the weekend.  And he goes, come here.  And he pulls me away from everybody down the hallway.  And, you know, I was pretty much told to shut up and listen while he just unloaded on me.  Wow.  Stating that.  Pointing and waving.  Pointing, that little crazy psycho dead stare right through you kind of thing.  Just pointing.  I nigh.  Oh, man.  I'm very familiar with this talk. 
[03:38:30]  Yeah?  Yeah.  To the point where he's sweating as he's talking because he's really intense.  Now he's coming.  And this was a different Steve than I've seen on a daily basis.  Oh, wow.  So, I just, I'm like, okay.  And I sat there.  Play the Dolph Vita March music right here.  Look at this.  Dolph Vita March music.  Oh, shit.  Here's, just so we're all abundantly clear, what I said to Eric.  Um, it was, yeah, I got my finger right in his face, looked at him as if he was a piece 
[03:39:00]  of fucking hamburger that had just been ripped through.  And, um, ooh, I said, I'm a good guy, and I will continue to be a good guy to you until  you fuck with me one too many times.  And then I will, yeah, exactly.  And then I will direct all of that good guy energy to fucking with you.  And then you will suggest that something happens to him.  No, I'll just start doing it.  No, I am a vindictive motherfucker when I get screwed with.  Okay, now two things.  One, that's interesting, because I've been finding out the politics. 
[03:39:30]  I mean, you'll get along.  I like Steve, man.  I would never have a problem.  But they say you only have the power of suggestion.  Yeah, basically.  Basically, you're a magician in here.  When it comes to them, so basically, what could you do to really fuck?  With them, if you have no, nothing more than suggestion.  It's not so much, it's not so much fucking with them, um, like within here. 
[03:40:00]  You can't really do anything.  You are.  You're completely castrated in here.  Nobody has any power.  Okay.  Nobody has any power.  But I'm the first person, a lot of times, that people come to and, hey, can you get  me into this event?  Hey, can you get me tickets to this event?  Okay.  Who does that?  You're like fucking Morgan Freeman from Shawshank.  You get things, and now you say fuck that.  I'm the first person on the phone with publicists and...  Uh-huh.  I'll get you a rock hammer.  And ticket brokers and people that need free shit.  I'm happy to do it. 
[03:40:30]  All of a sudden, oh, let's fuck with them a little bit.  The guy that gets the free shit, let's go fuck with them a little bit.  Oh, really?  Steve, I haven't asked you for tickets to...  This week.  No.  When did I ask you for tickets to an event?  I don't, dude.  It's not so much...  No, you brought it up.  Bring it.  Tell me when I asked you.  It's not tickets.  Yeah, I've never asked for anything.  What do I ask you for?  I know one thing, and it wasn't even for me.  Uh, what?  Stargate fucking box sets?  No, that came from...  That came from the publicists. 
[03:41:00]  Now, do you hear the stuttering in Eric's voice a little bit right now?  Yeah, you just started a little bit, dude.  It's taking advantage.  It's taking advantage of someone's good nature, who is happy to fucking do stuff for you,  until, bing, there's a little needle.  Dude, I never do anything to you.  That's the one thing that I've been doing for the longest time.  And I know you've been doing it for the longest time.  And you haven't said one word that this was a problem.  Now, let's get to the real thing. 
[03:41:30]  Yeah, what's the problem?  Why are you upset?  First of all, I've seen a picture of your breakfast.  Yeah.  Two giant hamburgers.  You're right.  It's usually something I didn't eat the night before.  And french fries, an omelet, and a chicken salad sandwich, or something.  Yeah, something like that.  Why are you upset that that is out there?  Because I'm a fucking addict who is able to kick every other fucking thing that he's  been addicted to, but he hasn't been able to fucking deal with this one yet.  So, for some reason, that one strikes a nerve.  Because I got over it once, dropped a pile of weight, got fucking surgery, and then when 
[03:42:00]  I stopped drinking, I jumped over to this addiction.  This is a little pity party for yourself.  You can't...  No, that's not a pity party at all.  It's not a pity party.  Do you think that that helps the ridiculousness of this will help you in the long run?  No.  I'll tell you something.  My old man, when I was a kid...  It's helping me, nigga.  No.  Here's something.  You got that giant hamburger.  When I was a kid, a man used to tell me, to my face, the world does not respect fat people.  If you get married, you'll never get a job.  No one will ever love you. 
[03:42:30]  I ballooned up to 400 pounds by the time I was 23 years old.  And you found that he...  So you lost weight.  You wound up achieving everything except for the people looking at you.  Right.  Thank you.  So, Steve, this fat issue...  I know.  This is...  And I'm not being funny, man.  Usually fat dudes...  Jolly.  Because we have the ability to be other than fat.  I mean, I know personality-wise, you got to be a little above a notch if you're fat. 
[03:43:00]  Why?  That's like such a...  Man, I don't want to say woman, but it's such a how women get depressed about fatness.  Dudes get depressed about fat a little bit more...  Dude-ish.  Like, you shouldn't...  You should be able to see that this is funny.  Yes.  Intellectually, I see it.  Emotionally, I don't.  So, aha!  So you should really...  Yeah, but the problem is E-Rock went through the same shit this week.  He didn't like the bit he was involved with.  Eric's a perpetual victim, unfortunately.  But you're being one, too, right now.  No, I don't think so. 
[03:43:30]  Not at all.  Not at all.  How so?  You're being a victim right now.  How so?  How so I'd be a victimized?  Because you told us once upon a time I was a little boy who my father told me this.  You asked what was behind it.  I'm telling you what was behind it.  Yes.  But that behind-it-ness is...  And I'm not saying you're perpetual, but you're victimizing yourself because you're angry emotionally about this.  It's not personal.  This is internal.  He just clicks on...  It's not his fault that you're having this issue.  No, it's not his fault that he's having this issue. 
[03:44:00]  What he's doing is instigating.  What he's doing is acting as a catalyst.  Now, did you know that he had this issue with his size?  No.  The way he does?  No.  It's...  Now he does.  If he does it again, then...  Now he does, and he'll do it twice as much.  Now he does, and he'll do it twice as much.  There's been times, too, I've seen some of the horrible shit that he was eating, and I'd say,  Steve, you know, with your surgery and everything else, are you supposed to be eating the bread?  Are you supposed to be doing this?  No, I'm not.  I've talked to him about this a few times, and that added with, he knew I've been doing 
[03:44:30]  this for a while.  Now, today, everything just fucking hit, and he went off.  You're a victim, Iraq.  Apparently.  Well, defend yourself.  You want a rape kit?  You could swab your ass.  No.  Get some DNA.  No.  Victim.  Victim.  Victim.  Victim.  That shit is hilarious.  His new character, Victim.  Vic.  Vic fucking hamburger.  Yeah, you know what?  Victim.  Again, intellectually. 
[03:45:00]  You're right.  Vic.  Dumb.  You're right.  Vic.  Dumb.  I get it.  I get it.  He just touched a nerve.  Yes.  He took the fucking nerve.  And, you know what you do?  I used to work on fucking Lansdowne Street.  You know what the hardest bitch was?  I used to work on Lansdowne Street.  Every fucking night.  In Boston.  Yeah.  Okay.  Every fucking night.  Do you know what a joy it is?  Boring.  Oh, shit.  Wow.  This is something Patrician.  I didn't even see your hand move.  Oh, God damn. 
[03:45:30]  Holy shit.  Oh, my God.  That was bad, man.  Why are you reaching for your little machine, man?  I want to prove that.  No, really.  Steve's opening it up.  It's about time he opens it up.  Oh, my God, man.  Lansdowne Street.  Don't be mad.  No, it's boring.  Once upon a time.  That's funny.  Oh, fuck balls.  Steve, I swear to God.  Call me.  Off air.  I want to talk to you, man. 
[03:46:00]  Fuck that.  Why is E-Rock hiding his face?  Because he's embarrassed that he's a victim?  He's Vic-dumb.  Vic-dumb.  I just got it.  Vic-dumb.  Why are you laughing at that?  That hurts E-Rock, dude.  Vic-dumb.  But that's what we're getting at.  That hurts him personally.  I love Vic-dumb.  He doesn't want to be called Vic-dumb.  Vic-dumb.  Best name ever.  Hey, Vic.  Mr. Dumb. 
[03:46:30]  God damn it.  He was ready.  So, Lansdowne Street.  Look, I'm not even close to buttons.  You said you worked on Lansdowne Street?  I worked on Lansdowne Street.  And I was huge then.  So, when somebody fucks with you when you're working in that place, what can you do?  You punch them in the face.  As hard as you fucking can.  Right.  You can't do that anymore in civilized, walking upright person society.  How much weight have you gained back since the surgery?  Since your smallest.  Since my smallest, about 50 pounds.  Probably 40, 50 pounds.  That's not a complete full-on-all. 
[03:47:00]  No, it's not.  But it's still...  It's fucking...  It's a Coke.  No.  No?  Well, okay.  I'm an addict.  I don't do that shit.  I can't do that shit.  No?  My sister died of a drug overdose.  So, I don't do that shit.  Coke in moderation?  You ever hear anybody?  I do Coke in moderation.  One nostril a week.  Yeah, that's it.  Can't do that.  So, now with my inherent developed ability, obviously, this is years ago, to deal with  people on a confrontational level taken away, I'm not as witty as these guys. 
[03:47:30]  I'm not, you know, and I'm not as witty as you or Ope or Ant or Jimmy, so I really can't  hold my own in here.  So...  But you say you're not as witty as Eric?  I'm not talking about Eric.  I just pointed at...  I'm sorry, Patrice.  It's Vic.  Yeah, I'm sorry.  Patrice, I clearly pointed at you, Ope, and Ant and referenced Jim, who isn't here.  Pitted.  So pitted.  So pitted.  This is crazy, man. 
[03:48:00]  So what is it...  This is fucking crazy!  Like, you must understand that it's not a good breakfast.  Absolutely.  So why not just not have the French fries?  Most, you know what, most days I throw them out, I bring them here, I don't eat them,  I throw them out.  And the fact that I'm bringing them here...  And I understand his addiction, by the way.  But I understand, too, but it's like falling off the wagon, you gotta, like, get back on.  Now, there was a point, you're working out, you're fucking, you know, you weren't, you 
[03:48:30]  weren't, you were big guy, you know, muscles and shit like that, and then you pack on a  few pounds, and then you must realize and go, alright, I gotta do something about this.  Now, your woman, your woman is, she was a trainer, right?  She is, she's a trainer.  Well, she's pregnant now, but she's a fitness model and a female bodybuilder, yeah.  So, as soon as y'all get, get, have the baby, she's gonna, you're gonna get right back.  She'll be right back on stage, yes.  But she'll be right back doing her, she makes you do your thing, right?  Um, truthfully, I've asked her to help me get, get back on, get back, get my shit back 
[03:49:00]  together, because I was, didn't like the way I, uh, I looked, but I've been fucking sliding  like crazy.  Anthony, Susan Waldman just saw a picture of, uh, Steve's breakfast.  Of all the dramatic things I've ever seen.  Oh my god.  Oh yeah!  Oh yeah!  Oh no!  Oh no! 
[03:49:30]  E-Rock.  E-Rock's a victim, that's a lie.  Vic.  Vic.  Vic.  I love Vic-dum.  What's up, Vic?  Victor-dum.  Dr. Van-dum.  Victor Van-dum.  That's terrible, man.  Sean-Claude Van-dum.  Uh, no.  E-Rock?  That's great.  E-Rock comment?  No.  Do you feel like you're a victim?  Today I do, yes. 
[03:50:00]  Today?  Why today?  It's not even about you today.  Oh, okay.  Like, earlier in the week, yeah.  Uh, only you can fix yourself, Steve.  Um, let's see.  You do realize that.  Fat is like a universe full of bubbles.  But I'm also, I'm also completely irrational and crazy.  Alright, fair enough.  What was that?  I'm irrational and crazy.  Thank you.  Oh.  I've never debated that fact.  The fact that I walk in here and, and, and, and on multiple occasions have thought about 
[03:50:30]  eviscerating somebody with my bare fucking hands.  I've never seen his eyes like this.  Especially for a person in a leadership role.  It's very healthy.  Go crying.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Yeah, from designated wiseass over there.  Hey, I'm just stating, I'm just stating the obvious and fact.  Danny doesn't like me.  So anything you, you, you, anything.  Pause for the course, Buster.  Can this be, can this, can this, can this be, he called him Buster.  Buster.  Yeah.  Danny's the most disrespectful shit mouth on the entire staff.  So anything that he says has to be taken.  Hold on there, chief.  Yeah. 
[03:51:00]  Buster.  Hold on there, chief.  Let's just.  Hey, wait a second, champ.  Allie.  Can, can this thing ever be fixed?  I, you know what, you know what, I, I extended an olive branch a few weeks ago and Danny, uh,  subsequently wiped his ass with it.  What was that?  What olive branch?  I offered to speak, I, I wrote you a polite email and said, you know what, it's been a  while since we spoke.  I think you and I should really have, have a conversation.  Can we speak?  I don't, I don't talk to people who, who would, who almost punch me in the face and  trying to get me fired.  Dude, you are lucky I never connected and knocked your fucking teeth out. 
[03:51:30]  No, you're lucky.  No, no, I'm not.  Dude, I, I would, the, the reason your attitude is so shitty, I think it's because you've never  had your ass properly fucking handed to you.  Yeah, because that's how you solve problems with people that you have disagreements with.  Yes, absolutely.  You just, you just, you just fling hard meat into their faces.  Yes.  That's not the way things work.  No, or you just smash them as hard as you can against the fucking wall.  Steve, that's a, that's a very unhealthy, it's an unhealthy attitude to have about, about,  about disputes and disagreements.  Oh, it fixes them real quick, though.  Oh, da, da, da, da. 
[03:52:00]  It fixes them right fucking quick.  No, no, Steve, it doesn't fix anything.  Because one person is unresponsive and in a cop in a fucking coma.  And then you're out of a job.  You're out of a job.  You go to jail and I sue your balls off.  So who wins?  Yeah, so who wins?  I'm fucking broke.  So who wins?  So then who really wins?  Me.  So keep, so keep, so keep, so keep settling all your disputes and arguments with, uh,  with your big meat fists and see where that gets you.  You know what, though, but Danny, you're going to be okay.  This is, this is unfair, dude. 
[03:52:30]  The, the, the, the, you're both playing this, the, this is wrong for you.  Hey, bud, what's your problem?  It's wrong for how you doing, Nick.  I hate this play.  And it's wrong for how he's threatening you, but it's wrong how you're doing it.  A Negro.  With a guy that just said he's just not going to be a witty guy with you.  A Negro.  Y'all should just stop, man.  That's fine.  Look, me, I know Steve for a very long time at this point.  Is this, there's no way to fucking be friends again?  And to be honest, no, I don't think so.  Because, uh, there was a, there was a point in time where Steve really, I feel that he  really fucked me really bad.  And I was really pissed, really, really pissed off. 
[03:53:00]  And ever since that day.  Do you feel like you fucked him bad?  No, I didn't.  That was the day I took him and just threw him into fucking garbage.  Because I was like, you know what, if that's the way you're going to be, bro,  then I don't really need to talk to you.  He has absolutely no responsibility for his actions.  So when I had to answer for him.  That's what we need.  Big fight.  Well, buckaroo.  Wait, what happened?  Buster?  I made some comments about his website and then he didn't like it.  So that's not, that's not it at all.  That is not it at all.  All right. 
[03:53:30]  Well, I always wonder what the big issue was.  We'll prove it any other way.  I honestly don't remember, but there was something that I can't fucking talk about,  unfortunately, because it's a matter of corporate bullshit.  But it had nothing to do with a comment you made about the website.  It was something that I was questioned about regarding your behavior and I had to answer  for.  It got you in trouble.  You thought I did it fucking deliberately.  You did.  Because it was like a day later.  It's nothing worse than not being able to sock a guy who's like fucking saying, I'll  fucking sue you.  Yeah, exactly.  I'll fucking sue you. 
[03:54:00]  Do you know what fucking rage that elicits?  It's nothing worse than a guy that goes, you're a fucking nothing because you want  to hit me.  You're in a Neanderthal, fat man.  Now eat your burgers.  And he just wants to toss this nigga through a wall.  And he fucking can't.  How you feel, Buster?  I didn't realize.  Not for nothing, but you know, I, I, I.  That's just so fucking annoying.  Razzle dazzle.  I did a lot, I did a lot of, I did a lot of stuff for Steve before this internship ever 
[03:54:30]  materialized.  It was all pro bono stuff.  I worked for his website, did some writing and stuff for him, you know, and that was  very nice.  And so I felt to be treated in this respect back, I felt was really fucked up and it  was just a smack in the face because he got his feelings hurt personally.  No, that wasn't it.  It is it, Steve.  That isn't it.  This has been years, isn't it?  Oh my God, you're so wrong.  Hold on.  Yeah, yeah.  How could you fucking, this is amazing.  Sam just goes, oh yeah.  Like he puts a sad face on Sam, like, oh, this is, I can't even be in the same room as,  oh, this is so upsetting to me. 
[03:55:00]  Sam has a boner that he's holding his, with his, with his pants weight.  He's one of those Star Trek monsters that gets strength from this.  Like, like people fighting, he gets actual strength.  Somewhere, somewhere in the sewer system of New York City.  There's orange goo that's bubbling.  Sam is such a piece of shit.  Sam is a fucking piece of shit.  I will accept that.  Criticism.  I will accept that.  How does Vic Dumb feel about that one?  He enjoyed that one.  Yeah. 
[03:55:30]  I heard him laugh.  That was funny.  I didn't think it would get it to be the Steve Danny thing, though, again.  It always is.  You two have a very volatile work relationship.  Yeah.  Yeah, one wants to sock the other, and the other one goes, please do, and you're fucking  out of here.  I'm going to sue you into even further bankruptcy.  Steve's a real...  Well, I've got news for you, buddy.  If you did, that's what I do.  How professional is it for a guy who's the executive producer of the show to raise a fist  to someone else?  How fucking professional is that? 
[03:56:00]  At the time, it felt like the best thing in the world.  But is it professional, Steve?  I don't...  This whole fucking room isn't professional.  Are you fucking kidding me?  This is the least professional environment you could possibly work in.  So then you're saying that it's...  I bet you Danny...  You know what?  You went, bro.  Danny would go...  It's like arguing on the internet.  If he hit him, if Steve hit Danny, Danny would go, oh, you did it now, pal.  Now you've done it.  Now you've done it, pal.  Dude, I've got pissed off around this place before.  And never once have I thought that a rational reaction would be to raise my fist to somebody. 
[03:56:30]  I've never once thought that that was going to be the proper road to go down in any dispute  or disagreement that has ever happened in this building or in the XM building.  Ever.  When's the last time you had a really nasty fist fight and got your face kicked the fuck  into a curb?  Seriously.  Did it ever happen?  Dude, that is not the end all and be all of everything.  No, you're not answering the question.  Fists do not solve problems, Steven.  They don't.  Sometimes they do.  Sometimes they really do.  And the fact that you can't answer that question means you probably never have.  Between quitting sex and... 
[03:57:00]  I need a good ass whipping.  And that'll win me right into shape.  It'll fucking still accept humility that you've never fucking hit.  I have been hit so fucking hard that I couldn't see straight.  I don't care.  Well, good.  Good.  You know what?  I don't care.  That says a monumental amount.  You're indifferent and you're a fucking wiseass.  No, your world is completely different than mine.  My world doesn't revolve around physicalities and yours does.  No, it has nothing to do with that.  Yes, it does.  That's your whole argument.  You have a massive problem with authority.  You hate people who fucking even remotely exemplify a father figure.  You fucking hate them. 
[03:57:30]  Wow.  No, that's...  Dude, now you're bringing your own things out to the audience.  No, I'm not.  No, I'm not.  Look, every fucking reaction to an authoritative decision, this guy fucking acts like he's  just pissed in his cornflakes.  Get my dad on the phone.  We'll talk about how much I hate my daddy and how I have daddy issues.  Everybody in this fucking room has daddy issues.  Do you have daddy issues?  You want to come over, Danny?  I love that.  I don't have a daddy issue.  My dad's dead and I fucking loved him the whole time.  What the fuck are you talking about?  One exception.  I had mommy issues.  This is going great.  Steve. 
[03:58:00]  Oh, Travis is here.  Holy shit.  Whoa, Travis left the other room.  Oh, I'm in here now.  Wait, wait, wait.  I gotta be on Steve's side.  This is the attack of the nerds.  And Steve is ogre and he can't...  What Steve does is take nerds and throws them through a window.  Steve is ogre and steps on his fucking Terminator doll that he built.  And Travis just tagged in.  He did.  Who's at your station right now, Travis? 
[03:58:30]  We have people.  A million people.  I can't let this happen because this is about to be...  It's Lilliput.  It's like Lilliput.  He's Gulliver.  It's Gulliver.  It's like they nanny on him with the I'm going to fucking poke you shit.  And he can't do shit to him.  What does Travis have on this whole thing?  I just don't know what he's got on him.  I completely disagree with Steve.  I completely agree with Danny.  And I'm tired of when Steve comes in here and he just dismisses Danny's opinion as Danny hates me. 
[03:59:00]  Well, here I am.  And I think that if you punch me in the face, nothing would change.  You would be out of a job and I would still be here.  You'd be in a coma.  More civil suits.  More civil suits.  Yeah, exactly.  Exactly.  Punching me in the face or punching Danny in the face is not going to solve anything.  You would be out of a job.  Silence is one of the parties.  You would be out of a job and...  But he doesn't...  This is the most ridiculous argument.  He's not going to ever punch you.  He doesn't think about punching you.  It's that he's... 
[03:59:30]  The way he is...  No, he thinks he's punching him.  Punching is flying.  But he'll never do it.  And that's not healthy for a boss to do.  That's not healthy.  Travis would be at his station going...  Oh, you fuckers.  It's not healthy.  I completely agree that by an executive producer saying, I'm irrational and crazy and I'll threaten  to punch you in the face.  That's not healthy.  That's not what a boss should do.  No one wants to work under those circumstances.  How is anyone going to respect that?  Why do you look and feel like Richard Dreyfuss right now? 
[04:00:00]  You sound like Richard Dreyfuss from Jaws.  You're not going to...  Until something comes up and bites you in the ass.  You got any better suggestions?  Is this the black girl body slam incident, by the way?  What?  Just shut down the show.  Holy...  No, the legal...  The legal thing.  What?  No.  All right. 
[04:00:30]  Is anybody...  Before that...  Leave Steve alone.  Which one was it?  Why don't y'all apologize?  What the fuck?  The Ralphie Mae finger in the butthole?  Whoa.  No fucking way, no...  No fucking way, no fucking way, no fucking way, no fucking way.  Nothing happened what?  Nothing can happen to make this stop.  Nothing?  I don't think so.  Oh, no.  I think that ship has sailed.  I'm very sorry for that.  Nothing?  I mean, we work together.  We have to work together.  But aside from that...  But I'm saying not to just be...  It seems like dudes just don't stay mad at each other when one goes, I'm sorry. 
[04:01:00]  It's very surface.  No, this is deeper than that.  This has been going on for a while.  It's a weird thing to be around somebody like that.  Years, actually.  I couldn't work.  I'd be like, damn, how could you come...  If I came in, if I found out, like, you go...  If I go...  You just go, I hate Patrice.  Yeah.  I come in and I go, but this motherfucker hates me.  Like, what?  I'm going to remove myself from this situation.  Steve, how are you going to deal with...  How can you be funny and fun with somebody that's... 
[04:01:30]  I know.  Steve, how are you going to deal with your own child?  Are you going to beat him up if he doesn't listen?  No, of course not.  Oh, my God.  Holy...  But, I mean, it's a fair point.  It's a fair point.  Because by your...  Child abuse.  By your argument, you're saying, well, you know, you don't listen, so my reaction to  that is I'll punch you.  So, if you have it in you to, like, work it out a different way with your own  child when your child is born, why not with your answer?  Why not with your answer?  Absolutely.  Different case entirely.  I learned a whole...  Why can't you bring some of those skills to the workplace then? 
[04:02:00]  I bring a lot of...  I actually...  I work on the fact that physical violence isn't going to get these guys working any harder.  Physical violence is the final 5% of any confrontation resolution, okay?  You try to resolve it every other way before it would ever get to that point, obviously.  But you...  So, the fact that...  So, you're getting close to punching someone because everything else isn't working.  He's at 94...  And with everybody piling on, he's getting close to coming in with three cheeseburgers. 
[04:02:30]  He's going to sit down, and he's going to fucking just light this studio up with some  fucking 5-1-1s, you know what I'm saying?  If he's starting to feel a little bit piled on, because here it comes.  You know what I mean?  I mean, you really got to fix this.  So, the way Patrice is saying it, it's everyone else's fault except...  And it's a bunch of...  Lookit, I'm on both sides, because I've learned that way, but it's really difficult when you're  physically a big dude, and dudes approach you with not... 
[04:03:00]  Fuck the fact that everybody can't fight or whatever, but dudes understand dudes.  You can't just be a dude and, one, not accept a motherfucker's apology if he apologizes.  Now, I'm not saying that he did, but fuck that.  If I go, man, I'm sorry.  You have to go, man.  You got to somehow embrace that.  Two, the idea of not fighting, it's just dudes, we think about that.  That's how we roll, is we might fight. 
[04:03:30]  And for other dudes to go, I'll sue you, motherfucker.  It just ain't cool as dudes.  This is non-dude shit.  To Eric and everybody, and Sam's out of it, because Sam's just that kind of witty-o, I  guess, but the motherfucker, I understand what he's saying, I understand what they're  saying, but this ain't dude shit.  That's the thing, man.  You can't be friends or around each other, talking about I'm going to sue you there.  That's bitches, man.  He's not my friend.  But you are, though, because you're hurt. 
[04:04:00]  Co-worker.  I was hurt two years ago.  But see, you do, because you're not over it.  That's what I mean.  I'm completely over it.  You're not over it, because you're not, you won't embrace being friends again.  That was one thing two years ago.  There's a million things every day.  There's a million things every day.  Fair enough, man.  It's like people that aren't friends, but have to work together, not liking each other.  Then you don't-  So how do they work together?  What's the example of you working together? 
[04:04:30]  Working together.  Steve and Danny.  Sam runs to the mic.  Old instigator Sam.  You have to understand, there's two-  You see, we have two offices here.  Danny's in one office.  Steve's in the other office.  They don't mix.  There's no talking.  There's no communication.  So what's the work?  When do they connect as workers?  They don't.  You're watching it.  This is it for right now.  Even the paperwork.  When is it three degrees of separation from them where these two have to collaborate to 
[04:05:00]  make this show go on?  There's never a time where paperwork transmits from his office to our office.  Everything is very self-contained.  So you don't work together.  No, we do not work together.  You're just dudes that exist in the same space.  He'll tell me that the guest has arrived and that's that.  We'll have a staff meeting once a week with all the staff and the bosses.  Steve will say what he's been doing.  That's news to Danny because they don't communicate whatsoever.  Which might be better.  It's not so much that they don't communicate.  So they're not co-workers. 
[04:05:30]  They just both get paid by SiriusXM and go home.  Steve will go through me to tell Danny something.  It's like a sitcom.  But not anymore because we found out you just soon too.  I'll have to ask Travis when I need to get Danny's attention.  Let me ask you a question, Steve.  Seriously.  A serious question.  When Ope wasn't in the other day, why would you hand CDs to everybody else but me?  Because they were on this side of the room and closer to get to.  Oh, no, don't be like that.  You didn't do it on purpose, Steve.  Well, then when have you ever handed Danny a CD when he's sitting here? 
[04:06:00]  I stopped doing it I don't know how many years ago.  So then why would you do it when Ope wasn't here?  It was calculated and deliberate.  And just admit the fact that you would rather not communicate with me.  Correct.  Fine.  That's fine.  Steve's not defending himself.  Well, I think that he doesn't give Danny the CD.  So then don't tell me that I don't communicate at my review next time.  But, you know, it's also, you know what, also, it's also, I hand something to Danny and  I get the Danny eye roll, whatever. 
[04:06:30]  The Danny eye roll, whatever.  That's what Steve's issue is.  Steve, he thinks that you don't give him stuff.  Wait, wait, what?  Steve thinks that if he hands you stuff, it won't get to Ope.  When have I ever not, what has never, what has never not made it in?  Like, I don't understand what.  Sabotage.  Wow.  That's a, that's a, this is fucking a, this is a movie.  Yeah, I never thought it was a fucking shit.  It's a James Bond shit.  Yep, yep.  Sabotagey.  And you think what I'm thinking?  10 second rant time?  Stiff drink.  Oh, and we should all smile now.  10 second tirade. 
[04:07:00]  Tirade?  It's a 10 second tirade?  I think Steve and Danny should each get one and then smile at each other afterwards.  Oh, you aren't doing that, Danny?  No, because there won't be a smile-only one, so it won't count.  Oh, shit.  So you don't play along with the 10 second tirade?  Nope.  Do it, baby.  They're doing it.  No?  Danny could smile and he could look at the teeth you're going to knock out.  Oh, Steve is just, that, the lack of physicality that Steve can't have right now.  It's got to be frustrating as hell.  I think he would, if he could choke Danny, he would then, even if Danny hated him, he'd  be like, dude, I'm sorry every day. 
[04:07:30]  Just to get that fucking energy out.  It would look like the beginning of Note Country for Old Men with the cop on the floor.  Oh, and he just, like Danny would be kicking and leaving scum marks on the floor and Steve  would just be like, argh, and just fucking choking the shit out of him.  And then he'd go along to everybody else and put that bolt through our heads.  Hey, Danny, what's the most, you've never lost anything in a coin toss, have you?  Vic?  You got anything Vic?  Vic dumb.  No, I'm not allowed.  Vic dumb. 
[04:08:00]  I'm not allowed to talk to Steve until I can figure out a way to properly apologize to him.  Oh, shit.  Have you thought about it yet?  No, not yet.  Well, you go home and think about it, young man.  Are you going to think about it?  He's dumb.  It's Vic dumb.  He's going to go home and think about something like fucking cotton candy and Ferris wheels.  Both guys have a point, man.  Wait, is he rocked?  Are you going to apologize to Steve?  I don't know, man.  I'll think about it.  Whose side are you on?  I don't see it happening.  Whose side am I on?  I'm on the side of me getting into my fucking truck and going home to my lovely house.  I'm on the side of them.  And having a stiff drink, cutting the coffee that they have for happiness.  Whose side are you on? 
[04:08:30]  Who do you think should apologize?  Well, first, E-Rock should apologize to Steve.  No, that ain't happening.  I thought about getting him an apology gift, but if I put cheeseburgers down on his desk,  I thought he would get upset.  I'll be honest.  I am biased because I've had personal run-ins with Steven behind the scenes, things that  don't want to discuss.  Which makes you believe in the...  No, no, no.  It's just I have a hard time being sampled, each other.  We work together.  We were very good friends, like at N.E.W. and stuff like that, but things just happen. 
[04:09:00]  Things happen.  We'll just say that.  And Danny is a very close friend of mine, so I'm a little biased, so I can't really...  Okay.  This is a preponderance of the evidence.  This is crazy because it makes Steve look bad.  No, no.  I'm not trying to make Steve look bad.  I'm just saying what the facts are.  He just loses friends.  Here's the problem.  Steve has a major problem.  Because the staff doesn't like him or respect him. 
[04:09:30]  And I don't know how it got to this point, but Steve's got a major problem.  He's got a major problem.  I have sat down, each member of this staff.  So you did something because these guys don't like you.  Oh, it is a rise up right here.  I can fit in this job.  I guess you don't have to like...  They'd frag you if it was Vietnam.  I'd love that.  And you don't have to like the guy that...  Sergeant Barnes, baby.  And you don't have to like the guy that's higher than you in the hierarchy of a fucking  workplace, but it goes way deeper than that.  Steve was a liar. 
[04:10:00]  Now, if we left this room now and he'd lock the door, Steve would sit them all down deaf.  Now, what you all know about deaf?  He'd kill them.  That's my honesty right there.  Steve's got a major issue with these guys.  Well, you know what?  To my face, they will contradict that.  That goes way past the workplace fucking...  Yeah, I know.  You love stunt brain.  You want a piece of me?  Like, if it was one...  Take a swing at me.  If it was one guy, then okay.  But it seems like...  These guys are in agreement. 
[04:10:30]  Well, if that's the case, then everybody lies.  Remember that scene?  Yeah.  Well, go ahead.  Yeah.  You fucking up the machine.  When the machine breaks down, we break down.  And I ain't gonna let that happen, boy.  Now, go ahead.  Y'all low.  Y'all low, Steve.  Go ahead.  I don't know, Steve.  I'm here, fellas.  I'm here, fellas. 
[04:11:00]  Kill me.  Kill me.  So what do you say, Bob?  Get the day off?  I got a bad feeling about this Friday.  I got a bad feeling about this one, Travis.  I don't think I'm gonna make it out of here.  I don't think I'm gonna make it out of here.  I don't think I'm gonna make it out of here.  We all gotta die sometime, Travis.  Holy shit.  Fucking Steve wants to put a hole in somebody's ass. 
[04:11:30]  Steve been shit on six times and he's still here.  You can't shit on Steve.  Let's have Sam talk for the group.  Because Danny comes from a place where we're not sure where he's coming from.  Yeah.  Technically.  E-Rock is too much of a pussy to speak up.  He's a victim.  He's a victim.  What, are you a homosexual? 
[04:12:00]  Sam, talk for the group.  What do you need to know?  About Steve, the work environment.  Who's wrong?  Who's right?  The relationship between Steve and the majority of the staff has undeniably been severed.  Wait, start over.  Wait a minute.  Could you start over?  That's a direct contradiction.  This music playing right now is the greatest Vendorf that ever lived.  See, we don't need Travis because he didn't pick this one.  Oh, my God.  That's how this Steve laughs.  I don't know.  I just feel bad about this, brothers. 
[04:12:30]  I just feel bad.  I feel bad.  What are you, a crusader, Travis?  We got ourselves a crusader.  We got ourselves a crusader.  Look at this lump of shit.  I caught you taking a picture of Steve's breakfast one more time.  I swear to God, you're going to get a goddamn ticket out of here in a body bag. 
[04:13:00]  I shit you not.  I shit you not.  Bag and tag this piece of shit.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  This music.  Oh, it's perfect.  It's just.  I'm sorry.  Go ahead, Sam.  This music is beautiful.  Wrap us up with that.  Yeah, Sam will put it all together here.  Perspective.  I think.  Start over.  Because now we're.  Okay.  The relationship between Steve and the majority of the staff. 
[04:13:30]  Now, could you start?  Dear Grandma.  Relationship between.  And the majority of the staff has been undeniably severed, as evidenced today.  To Steve's credit, the last time Steve had a big thing on the air with all of us against him,  he reached out to all of us.  Get me a medic.  Go on.  Get me a medic.  And he talked to all of us.  Okay, do it.  Do it, boy.  Do it, boy. 
[04:14:00]  Get me a medic.  Okay, then.  Do it.  I can't stop.  It's just such a great fucking movie.  I'm sorry.  Go ahead.  It's a lovely fucking war.  Oh, shit.  Since that time, I have had no issues with Steve at all.  Yeah.  And our relationship is fine. 
[04:14:30]  Our working relationship is totally cool.  I see.  Eric did some things today that got under Steve's skin.  However, I think, and if pressed, Steve would probably admit that his major yelling at Eric  was due to frustrations that maybe Danny and maybe also Travis had built up in Steve.  I can't listen to nothing but just music.  They took out on Eric.  I can't listen to shit.  But how long ago have they, you know.  What do you mean?  How long ago have they frustrated Steve to where he would take it out? 
[04:15:00]  No, that's not accurate.  I'll admit it.  Danny has been frustrating Steve.  Hang on.  Danny has been frustrating Steve for...  Two years.  Two years, at least.  Their relationship will never be fixed.  Close to three.  Whatsoever.  We gotta settle this now.  Remember that now it has happened back at N.E.W.  They ripped us the fuck apart.  And I personally...  Can you just do this jumping up and down on one leg and laughing?  This music makes everything sad.  It's fucking terrible. 
[04:15:30]  Well, this music is fucking the worst.  It really is.  A doggy-o is the worst.  It's the saddest music ever made.  I can't...  I want to laugh.  Look at Steve's face.  Yeah.  With this music.  This is terrible.  Yeah.  Sam.  I think Steve's issues with Danny primarily played a part in what he took out on Eric.  And I think that when he says, pick a side, as Eric said, he said, I don't know if he said it or not.  But if he said, pick a side, I think he believes that the team that's opposing him is Danny and Travis, since they're such good friends. 
[04:16:00]  The Rock is the son of, born of those two fathers.  As Ma says, for a battle of your soul.  Jesus.  Ah, shit.  Holy shit.  And that's it? 
[04:16:30]  This is it.  I mean, the issue here, the primary issue, even with the Eric thing, all of the issue is between Steve and Danny.  I think.  Maybe you disagree.  Well, to make a statement, just backing up a few, that my relationship with the entire staff has been severed, I think that's completely incorrect.  Majority.  Because I've reached out to everybody, and everybody, to my face or over the phone, said I got no problem with you.  And that was, I don't know, what, two months ago?  Yes.  Two months ago.  So since then, I don't know. 
[04:17:00]  Well, but that's the thing.  You said that's when you reached out to Danny and he didn't respond.  I said I have no problem with you, and I just said.  So one person through the whole studio.  No, I said it too.  To Travis and Danny.  What?  I said it to you too.  What?  To your face.  What?  When you came in to me right after this whole incident, like, what is your fucking problem with me?  I told you some of the issues I had with you.  I said, overall, I don't, like, fucking hate you as you assumed everyone else here does.  And I told you that to your face.  Eric doesn't have a problem with you.  He just thinks your breakfasts are funny.  Yes.  I understand that.  Danny has a problem with you. 
[04:17:30]  Yes.  I understand that.  And you have a problem with Danny.  Yes.  I don't understand why we don't all hate Sam.  Why would you hate Sam?  Because he's the Colonel Curse.  How the fuck does he skate?  How does that work?  I don't do anything.  What did he say?  He's Colonel Curse.  Like, he has his own island and, like, you know, all his people.  We're going to apocalypse now.  Yeah.  Well, he knows when, you know, he decides whose heads get severed and stuff.  But everybody's afraid to confront him.  It's weird.  We all should hate Sam.  Why would anybody hate Sam?  I think that's what would solve this problem.  That's not a good solution. 
[04:18:00]  Nobody should hate Sam.  I've never done anything to anybody.  Let's be honest here.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, no.  We've changed movies.  Now we're on to another movie.  All right.  I really need to just wrap up.  It's getting late.  Yeah, it's getting very late.  SiriusXM.  I can't believe I'm still at SiriusXM. 
[04:18:30]  We could reach a resolution today.  Yeah.  How?  But in two months.  I'm just saying, some people could apologize and everything.  We could say, okay, everyone's fine.  Within the next two to four months, something will be done.  Steve will get pissed off, and it will result in, regardless of who is at fault, Steve and  Danny arguing, because that's where the real problem lies.  Let's be honest with each other.  So if they solve their issue, which they won't ever, everything is much better.  But they would, I mean, they're just, they need to just separate from each other and not worry about each other. 
[04:19:00]  When Danny says he's over Steve, then don't give Steve a second thought.  And Steve should not give Danny a second thought.  Just act as islands amongst each other.  Travis and me.  I hope I can be on your eyes.  Yeah, but you still have hostility towards Steve.  Well, I'm not going to magically like somebody.  No, there's a difference between, there's three things here.  There's liking, not liking, and having them out of your system. 
[04:19:30]  And emotionally, right, you're not, that's what I'm saying.  Exactly, you're not indifferent.  You do have some dislike.  You have pain there.  You dislike, Steve.  Well, because I still have to, we still have to function on a daily basis.  You don't.  No, we do, because I still have to show up, and he has to show up, and we have to cross paths eventually.  We're going to have to build a new staff hand.  Yeah.  Not a whole new staff.  We're going to have to start from scratch.  No, you don't need to fire everybody.  For the third time.  For the third time, we're going to have to start from scratch. 
[04:20:00]  There's no reason.  You've done it before?  What do you think?  But Steve has been in for years.  Sam, I've watched this happen.  Everyone's gone, except for those two.  Some of us are fine.  Oh, except for which two?  Open hand.  Some of us are fine.  Back to basics.  Some of us don't have any issues.  Let's go back to basics.  Me and you, kid.  That's it.  Well, I mean, no.  Some people are.  Nah, we don't need you.  Just stick around.  Yeah.  Sam, I've been around for 11 years.  The old staff thought they needed us.  You called me throw a man saying.  I think we made that obvious.  Great.  I've been around.  What's wrong? 
[04:20:30]  What happened, Danny?  No, nothing.  We should just end the show.  Steve just makes Danny sick.  Vic has something.  Vic.  Well, Vic Dumb.  It's Vic Dumb, everybody.  That name has been taken on Twitter and every message board, by the way.  Vic Dumb.  It's over.  Thank you.  Well, if this is the source of all the conflict.  You.  No, not me.  The Danny Steve stuff here.  If this is the source of Steve's aggravation, then his blow up today, I think Steve owes 
[04:21:00]  me an apology.  I agree with that.  Oh, shit.  That's fair.  Based on what we.  Yeah, because E-Rock was just trying to keep it fun.  Who's in charge here?  I don't know, man.  I thought you were.  Perfect.  Jesus.  I think E-Rock was trying to keep it.  E-Rock.  Keep it fun.  And what this show's all about.  I think Eric was under the assumption that we worked on a comedy show.  Whoa.  No.  That's.  That's.  That's.  Travis.  That's not the get out of jail free card.  It's not.  Yes, it is.  We work on a comedy show. 
[04:21:30]  And you're the only one who can't take a joke.  It feels good to laugh.  I just.  I just.  I just.  I just.  I just.  I just pulled the tubes aside from a shot glass, not the hell of a boat.  Look, fellas, let's be reasonable here.  My boy was in that studio, too.  You want to cut Steve open and see how many cheeseburgers?  Oh, God. 
[04:22:00]  I'll not stand by you.  I'm just saying.  I'm just saying.  I didn't say it.  I didn't say it.  I didn't say it.  It could have been.  Steve.  I'm just saying.  The bite wounds on that hamburger.  Let's be reasonable here.  This is not the time or place to perform some kind of a half-assed autopsy on an executive producer.  And I, for one, am not going to stay in this studio while we cut Steve open and watch those french fries spill out all over the carpet.  We changed movies again. 
[04:22:30]  What the hell's going on?  I heard that there were some french fries eaten in this table yesterday.  And you knew about it.  I just want to say that Danny and Steve were in the studio at some point and some feelings were hurt.  But everything is fine now.  And this studio will stay open. 
[04:23:00]  Steve.  Hey, man.  It's too late now.  You're the mayor.  You're the mayor of Burger Island.  Can you sing that lullaby for everyone, Ed?  How's it going, Andy?  Do you know the Burger Man?  The Burger Man.  The Burger Man.  Do you know the Burger Man?  Wow.  So, E-Rock should get an apology because we do work on a comedy show. 
[04:23:30]  And I think E-Rock was trying just to kind of bring some material to the show.  Y'all know me.  Y'all know me.  You know what I do for a living.  I'm not talking about hooking bluegills or tommy cats.  I'm talking about Steve.  I'm talking about working for a living.  Steve, man.  Stop it, man.  Stop it, man.  What about Cage goes into the water?  This is crazy.  Cage goes into the water.  You're going to the cage.  Burger's in the cage.  Steve's in the water.  Hi, Steve. 
[04:24:00]  Farewell and adieu to your best-aged lady.  Farewell and adieu, you lady.  I'll show you this scar on my chin where Steve got mad and punched me in the face.  Show me the way to go home.  Scar on my chin where I try to take away his burger.  All right, let's get the E-Rock-Steve relationship back together.  The E-Rock-Steve relationship can be mended. 
[04:24:30]  Well, a little apology.  That would be nice.  A mutual apology.  Ain't you watching it, Carleesi?  Steve can't stay down with three barrels.  Not with three barrels.  Ah, shit.  Eric, do you feel you did anything wrong today?  No, I do not.  See, that's where we're at.  I'll apologize for you having awful breakfast.  That's about it.  Well, then I'm not apologizing for my overreaction.  Now, Steve, you should apologize because you're sorry, not because Eric feels a certain way. 
[04:25:00]  How many burgers did he eat?  20.  25.  All three tons of them.  Oh, my God.  I, nine.  I, nine, nine.  Hey, Steve, I think, look.  What do you think, Patrice?  Hey, Eric.  Smile, you son of a burger.  I think you're going to get this little needle through that flamer shirt.  Not that you're sorry for what you did, but there's a court term called intent versus impact. 
[04:25:30]  You didn't intend to do nothing fucked up, but something fucked up happened.  And you can apologize for the fucked upness that happened.  Oh.  You understand?  You don't have to apologize for your intentions, but the fact that you hurt his feelings, you can say, I apologize.  For a harmless ongoing bit that he was well aware of for the last several months, that just, it was sort of an inside joke to the show that got brought again on air and he couldn't handle it.  It's not an inside joke if you're tweeting it. 
[04:26:00]  Yeah, thank you.  Thank you.  It's not an inside joke if you're publicizing it.  I just want to put that out there.  And Steve, to be fair, you know that you, as a dude, I respect your dude-ness, but you got emotional, man.  And you got over-emotional.  I can apologize for-  And you should apologize for the fact of how it got taken and not where it came from.  I can apologize for overreacting if he can apologize for hurting my feelings.  See, this is tit for tat.  It's not, somebody got to be a man about this shit.  The burger has been bitten in two in the middle. 
[04:26:30]  The bun is partially eaten.  This was not a boating accident.  This was a bear attack.  Fries in the basket.  Basket goes in oil.  That's a good one.  Funniest listeners in radio right there.  And Boobie, Boobie, man, Boobie, man.  I think we're going to need a bigger bun.  Oh, no, I, no, I, no, I need a bigger bun. 
[04:27:00]  Lord have mercy, man.  Oh, fuck.  This is terrible.  Basket goes in the, fries go in the basket.  Basket goes in the fryer.  That's right later.  Farewell, and I do you fast, man, this lady.  All right, Iraq, no apologies.  Sorry, buddy.  This is, this is not good, man.  It can at least start it there. 
[04:27:30]  Eric, if you can apologize for hurting my feelings, I can apologize for reacting.  The healing could start.  Overreacting and threatening me with work shit and, you know, being physical and all that fun.  Why can't you do it?  I didn't threaten you with physicality.  Dude, over a lousy joke that's been going on for several months.  Just give Mayor McKee's an apology to some of you all.  Oh, shit.  Oh, nye.  Did that hurt your feelings?  Nye.  Maybe I'll turn it on.  Man, McChase is terrible.  This is terrible, man. 
[04:28:00]  Oh, shit.  What happened?  Did I interrupt the...  Ronnie, help us out!  Help us out!  Look at Ron.  He's just like, I got here early today.  Yeah, 10 after.  Ronnie got here early and everything.  Ronnie, help us out.  Thanks for the late lunch, boys.  I really appreciate it.  We need some wisdom.  The whole place is falling apart, Ronnie.  The place is falling apart at the seams.  And you're pretty used to this shit on your show.  You've seen this happening for many years.  Well, all I know is yesterday, Steve told me that Danny's a fucking asshole. 
[04:28:30]  And there's a picture of Danny on the internet blowing some other guy.  So, I don't know if that helps.  I hope it does.  Yeah, I've helped out.  Thanks, Patrice.  You're right.  Jesus Christ.  It's good to see you.  We're imploding here.  Yeah, well...  This is the day.  This is the day you've been expecting.  The beauty of it is the show failed years ago.  There's no fucking reason to still do this for any of us. 
[04:29:00]  This has got to be some kind of limbo, doesn't it?  Where we all live now.  Like, we didn't know that we died.  Yeah, this is...  The fucking plane went down.  We blew it a long time ago.  What are we doing?  We're all still sitting here with microphones.  Because they're not onto it.  God, is that true?  We're still here with microphones and this fucking...  I don't even know how this is broadcast. 
[04:29:30]  Yeah.  We're just in limbo.  Holy shit.  And everybody's just fighting with each other.  At each other's throats for no fucking reason.  Well, you know, yesterday...  What's his name?  Cross comes to me.  And he goes, we've got a problem.  You've got Ed Begley booked and so do ONA.  And I go, no problem.  Cancel him.  Because I don't give a fuck.  Yeah, it's like we got a battle of who's going to get Ed Begley Jr.  Yeah, right. 
[04:30:00]  So now I don't have to take ten minutes and pretend that Ed Begley Jr.  It's fucking interesting.  And this should be great here, right?  This should be fucking great.  This should be gravy.  Yeah.  Just nothing.  Oh, sorry, Steve.  It should be...  I shouldn't use the word gravy.  Oh, jeez.  Oh, I know.  I know.  I know.  Yeah, it should be the easiest gig ever.  We just come in.  I don't think anyone knows what the fuck we're doing.  No.  I don't think people know if we're even here. 
[04:30:30]  No, occasionally people go, you guys are great.  Yeah, yeah.  Really?  Tell me one great thing we did.  Just tell me one.  It's just the atmosphere, you know, the vibe I'm getting.  Yeah.  The chemistry is just...  People in the halls are talking.  You know something?  Yeah, we get that, too.  So fucking what?  The past week has probably been the best week of shows you guys have ever done.  We're on vacation.  Last week.  It's from N.E.W.  What are you fucking talking about?  So this is it?  You guys are done now?  Yeah, I think so.  I think we're going to finish up.  I mean, everything?  Yeah, I think so.  Yeah, yeah.  Close it down? 
[04:31:00]  This is a rift.  This is a good place to leave it.  Yeah, there's a rift here.  I don't think it's curable.  Speaking of curable, what about your partner there, Fraserica?  Is he back today?  Yeah, he's back.  I'll just tell you this.  We walked in, and the receptionist looked so freaked when she saw him because of the  fucking toop, and there's a strap hanging out of the side of his fucking hair, like  a chin strap.  Because his head is shaved.  He's got the worst toupee ever on his head. 
[04:31:30]  They're forcing him to wear it.  Poor Fezzy.  Only to freak out everybody who works here.  To freak out everybody, yeah.  It's brilliant.  It's brilliant.  I was online last night seeing how much those horn implants cost.  He put two fucking horns on his head.  That would rule.  But he's back in today?  Yeah, he's back.  All right.  He's got his ulcers.  He's got his polyps.  Heard about all kinds of stuff.  AIDS.  They found a little bit of AIDS in there. 
[04:32:00]  They snaked all kinds of cameras in him, and apparently there's like stalagmites and stalactites.  They find some shit in him?  Yeah, they found plenty of stuff.  All kinds of things.  They got three ulcers, a couple of polyps.  Eitan Pates.  And a couple of spots.  We don't like to look at those.  We're going to take some tests.  Oh, shit.  Can you imagine the heat on the Ryan and Fez show?  I was just saying, have fun with that, Ronnie.  Yeah.  Have fun with that one.  Fezzy dying?  That fucking...  I'll milk that for fucking nine months right after the funeral.  Jesus Christ.  I lost my best friend yesterday. 
[04:32:30]  Big funeral at the Hard Rock.  Johnny's already booking a date.  Can John do funerals as well as weddings?  Maybe my sister will do the...  That'd be perfect.  Yeah, that'd be good.  Not a dry eye in the house.  She'll be smiling.  Ladies and gentlemen, we're all here for fun.  He would have liked it this way.  Yeah.  Rock and roll.  Rock and roll.  Rock and roll funerals.  All right, we should get out of here.  Yeah, let's let these guys actually...  At least do an hour.  We don't care.  Take all the time we need.  I know.  Believe me. 
[04:33:00]  That's what we figured.  I could tell by listening.  We kind of figured that.  People are yelling and screaming at us.  I'm like, I don't think Ronnie cares.  I don't care.  I like to say, I don't care about you, the listener.  That's where I am right now.  That's exactly the way you feel.  That's fantastic.  So we got nothing done, even though we did an extra hour for everybody.  I think a lot got settled.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  It's good to have it in the open, finally.  We got to get out three fantastic movie lines.  Like, lines from three fantastic movies with the music and everything.  Yeah, it was great.  It was a great time. 
[04:33:30]  I'm going to listen to the replay.  I'm a fan of the last hour of this show.  So listen to the replay while you're doing the Compound show.  Just be sitting there.  I'll do that.  That'd be perfect.  People can watch me listening to the replay of the show.  Fantastic.  All right, Patrice.  Pleasure.  DC Improv next weekend.  Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.  Big Mama Prods on Twitter.  Thank you, sir.  And that's it, I guess.  Ron and Fez, of course, up next.  Ron and Fez.  We're going to start our weekends.  And we're not doing any live reads because we have to go home now.  We could do those. 
[04:34:00]  Monday.  Yeah.  I'll do them for my truck.  Yeah, that's good.  I'll call up from my truck and do it on the expressway.  All right.  We'll see you guys Monday. </pre>
