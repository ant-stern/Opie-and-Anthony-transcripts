<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with commercials for various products and services, followed by a highly offensive and critical discussion of the comic strip "Kathy," its perceived lesbian themes, and a lack of humor.  A caller, Larry from Connecticut, surprisingly defended the strip.  The hosts then moved on to similarly disparage other comic strips like "Beetle Bailey," "Blondie," "The Lockhorns," and "Family Circus,"  followed by a lengthy, crude discussion of Hustler cartoons.  They then ridiculed LL Cool J's inspirational tweets with mocking commentary and an "Inspirational Jimmy" bit. The segment concluded with jokes about the Gulf of Mexico oil spill and the announcement that Amy Schumer was in studio.

Amy Schumer joined the show, recounting a surfing accident resulting in a 41-stitch leg wound and discussing her fear of ocean monsters.  The conversation shifted to her weight loss, eating disorder, single status, and anxieties.  A frank and explicit discussion of Amy's pornography preferences followed, alongside jokes about Mel Gibson's leaked tapes.  Amy shared details about her father's illness and incontinence, her stand-up career (including gigs in Nacogdoches, Texas), her role on *Curb Your Enthusiasm*, and a new show with Mark Hoppus.  The segment was filled with sexually explicit jokes and vulgar language from all participants, and concluded with a graphic discussion of the "blue waffle" internet meme.

The broadcast continued with more commercials, before Anthony detailed a violent and chaotic Memorial Day weekend in Wildwood, New Jersey, describing multiple fights, alleged police inaction, and encounters with a shirtless Latino man and an albino man. He used racial and ethnic slurs recounted from the events. A clip of Louis C.K. discussing Father's Day was played, prompting discussion of the public reaction and Anthony's own experiences with marriage, relationships, and attempts (or lack thereof) to father children. The discussion involved crude language about sex and relationships.

Comedian Louis C.K. then joined the show. The conversation centered on relationship difficulties, including a host's story about an unwanted commitment,  and caller anecdotes about abusive marriages and the challenges of divorce and child custody.  Callers Jimmy Greco and another described difficult marital situations and the impact on their children.  The hosts and Louis C.K. shared personal parenting experiences and discussed the challenges of small talk and social interactions. Explicit and offensive language was used throughout the segment.

A subsequent segment focused on the frustrations of parenthood, particularly the anxieties and social dynamics of children's playdates and school interactions. Opie expressed his aversion to other parents and described strategies to avoid them.  The discussion touched on the negativity of parental circles, Louie C.K.'s nude scenes in "Louie," Jay Moore's inappropriate behavior, and a recollection of a childhood experience with a child molester.  The latter half detailed a workplace conflict over a toaster oven, escalating into a broader discussion of petty rules, micromanagement, and listener calls about similar workplace frustrations.  Louie C.K. was present in the studio for this segment.

The show featured several commercial breaks advertising franchises, a sugar daddy dating site, trucking opportunities, a cancer research campaign, and other products and services.  The main discussion involved comedian Patrice O'Neal, and centered on offensive and stereotypical comparisons of white and black people's drinking and sexual habits. The conversation was highly vulgar and explicit. Later, the hosts discussed a rare Sam Adams bottle, initially believing it to be valuable, only to find out otherwise.  They also discussed the value of a Louis XIII cognac, reminisced about the Disney movie *Gus*, and mentioned *Mr. Limpet*.

A final segment focused on *Gus*, with the hosts and a caller, Ron, analyzing the plot and its supposed twist.  The discussion heavily featured explicit descriptions of Stella Stevens' physique, past and present, vulgar language, and comments on Kurt Russell's career transition from Disney films to more adult roles, before concluding with more commercials.

It's the best, best, best of a kid in a day.  Holy shit, we've got a busy show today.  Very, very sad news.  Kathy the comic strip will end in October after 34 years.  What? 
[00:02:30]  Didn't that comic strip end about 20 years ago?  Please.  Who the fuck reads Kathy in the comic strip?  What, do they finally show her digging her face into a cartoon muff?  The dyke that she is?  Oh, you think that was a lesbian cartoon?  Cartoon doik.  Is it even in our papers?  Sometimes it's gotta be.  Really?  It's gotta be.  Uh, what, hello?  Hello?  Gregorio, hi.  Hello?  Caller?  Hello, caller?  You're on the air.  Oh.  Okay.  How did I do that? 
[00:03:00]  Gregorio hit something.  He leaned over to get the paper, probably.  But then he pushed that button to make it stop way over there.  Can the keyboard do something for the phone?  Yeah, maybe.  That scared the shit out of me.  All right.  I could do a show with the dial tone in the background the whole day, though.  That would be kind of fun.  Why not?  Why not?  Why not?  How did your phone die?  The creator of Kathy basically says she shot himself in the head realizing what he's done  for 36 years or whatever it is. 
[00:03:30]  It's a woman.  Oh, sorry.  And she said that she ran out of creative juice.  In 1977.  Exactly.  Ran out of creative juice?  And she wants to go try something else.  The only juice that's worth anything on them.  And I guess the New York paper decided to blow off Kathy many years ago because I don't  see it in this.  Kathy fucking stinks.  Kathy sucks a clit.  What was the big fucking story with Kathy?  I don't fucking know.  Was it always trying to find a date? 
[00:04:00]  Oh, is that it?  Trouble at the office.  Oh, there's Kathy.  Oh, no.  That's right.  That's the face transplant lady.  Oh, no.  I got confused for a second.  She's terrible, that lady.  Oh, Easter Island woman.  She's the real life Kathy, though.  Yeah, she is.  She decided to get the Kathy makeover.  Can we get the Kathy comic strip online, maybe?  Because it's not in the paper.  I mean, Blondie's in the paper, thank God.  And Doonesbury and Beetle Bailey, thank God. 
[00:04:30]  That can't be the same person writing Blondie still.  There's no way.  Blondie was like in the fucking 40s, I think.  All comic strips should end.  They just, they stink irrelevant.  They're not funny.  Nobody laughs.  I've never seen anybody go like, even reading, never.  Why are they scared to just not do this anymore?  This means the funny papers.  No one would notice.  The funny papers.  Is this Kathy?  All right, it's a picture of a woman.  Yeah, walk us through. 
[00:05:00]  Is this today's strip?  All right, Jim.  Very important considering it's ending in October after 34 years.  A woman in a blue polka-dotted shirt, kind of poking out of a picture frame, with very, very short gray hair and nose glasses.  Boy, I wonder, is she an old lesbian?  Oh, boy, she has to be.  Old dyke.  And she says, I've told you for years you were taking too many pictures, but you wouldn't listen.  Next one.  What on earth will you do with so many pictures?  And then here comes the next one.  I guess she's typing this into her computer. 
[00:05:30]  Look at your pretty smile in this one.  Look how your eyes sparkle in this one.  And look at the cute way you turned your head.  Look how lovely you are.  I just want to squeeze you.  And now she's sitting in with two other people, one of whom is Kathy.  Last frame.  Oh, Kathy finally makes an appearance.  And the guy says...  Thanks for throwing us a bone.  When mother says there are too many pictures, she means there are too many pictures of other things besides her baby.  And then the mother says, are there any more of you? 
[00:06:00]  With hearts around her head.  Like she complained and complained and complained.  What?  Wait, what?  I saw any pictures.  Wait, what?  What just happened?  And Kathy doesn't say a word in this one.  What?  What happened?  Kathy's just standing in the background.  The mother has dementia, obviously.  And what's happened is she shit her pants.  And as the orderly pushes her face into a pillow, she's thinking about Kathy in old pictures.  Fucking horrible.  What happened?  She ran out of creative juices.  Oh, my God.  In the middle of that strip. 
[00:06:30]  But what's the point of the strip?  Dude, I don't get it.  I don't get it.  She's looking at pictures and then what happens?  Who is compelled to read that every day and go like, aha, that's good.  Can't wait till tomorrow.  So, holy shit.  The comic strip is an irrelevant feature.  Try one more.  This was yesterday.  Oh, because Kathy's in this one.  Oh, okay.  All right.  We got a big one with Kathy.  Kathy is talking in front of a computer monitor.  To what?  Some androgynous thing.  What is that thing?  Some androgynous thing. 
[00:07:00]  Is that a guy or a girl?  Can't tell.  Wow.  Okay.  Short hair, odd looking.  Kathy says, why did we take 87 shots of the fern outside our vacation hotel room?  And the thing says, why not?  Wait, does she vacation with a woman?  We don't know what that is.  Is this a lesbian cartoon and we just didn't know all these years?  It might be work.  Like, does Kathy like work at a photography studio?  It says vacation hotel room.  Like, they went on vacation.  Outside our vacation hotel room. 
[00:07:30]  That means they were doing some scissoring.  Oh, Kathy scissors.  Just mushing genitals together.  The unsexy sweater she wears every day.  All right, go ahead.  Sorry.  That's right.  The other one says, why not?  Why not?  It's so easy to edit in camera as you go.  And then Kathy says, why don't we ever edit in camera as we went?  Why didn't we ever edit in camera as we went?  And then thing says, it's easier to edit on the computer each night.  And then Kathy says, why didn't we edit on the computer each night? 
[00:08:00]  And then the thing says, it's easier to edit at home when we have more time.  Ha ha.  Like that will ever happen.  And then Kathy says, all we managed to delete is the possibility that we'd ever delete anything.  And then the other one says, ta-da, our first edit.  Holy shit.  It's ungodly.  That sucks.  How bad that is.  That just makes you angry.  I'm mad.  Yes.  I'm mad at how unfunny and just, there's nothing there. 
[00:08:30]  Holy shit.  Do you think the paper gets that?  This is like, wow, she's really lost this.  No, they don't even look at it.  They just put it in.  They put it in and send her a giant check.  This is an art form that has passed everyone by.  It's just gone.  I love the political cartoonists in the post.  I think they say some really fucking, like, poignant shit.  They have one frame to do it.  Yeah, yeah.  Those guys are actually really good.  Those are out of the comic strip section, too.  They're just, you know, they're on editorial pages and things like that. 
[00:09:00]  This is in the comic section.  I don't even know what we just read.  It's horrendous.  What are we getting done there?  I don't know what that is.  I should start my own syndicated comic.  Yes, you should.  And apparently the comics are all available online somewhere, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  They all have their own sites.  Why is it even in the paper?  The newspaper could be one page.  Yeah.  Just one page.  The top story, which you don't even need.  Actually, no pages. 
[00:09:30]  None pages.  Yeah, you don't really need fucking newspapers anymore.  The funny paper.  All right, well.  Don't.  Go spray some DDT on Grandpa.  I guess someone out there is going to miss Kathy.  I don't know who.  Yeah.  I don't know what her audience is.  I would assume old lesbians or something.  Yeah, they think it's, you know, people like to curl up with a good book.  Wait, Larry in Connecticut wants to.  Larry, are you trying to defend the Kathy comic strip?  Look, Kathy is not about anything that you're talking about. 
[00:10:00]  What's it about?  The comic strip, Kathy, is about the struggles of a modern woman who's trying to make her way  in a modern world, trying to deal with issues at work, trying to deal with her issues having  to do with her body, and also bothered by a loving, overbearing mother, a loving, overbearing  father, a mischievous dog.  It's just about life for a woman in the modern world.  So you found a synopsis online?  Say pardon?  You found a synopsis online, did you? 
[00:10:30]  No, I've read Kathy in the comic strip when I buy the paper every day, just like I read  Beetle Bailey and Blondie and Pickles and...  Pickles.  Wait, wait.  I read the comics.  Sir, why do you read...  I read the comics.  Why do you read...  Why do you read Beetle Bailey?  Do you get a good laugh out of that, do you?  Could you find Beetle Bailey?  Hold on.  Sometimes I get a real good chuckle out of it, because I see people...  All right.  It was when I soldiered in Beetle Bailey.  All right, listen.  We're going to have an open mind.  We're going to read today's Beetle Bailey for you. 
[00:11:00]  All right.  And then you maybe can explain it.  So hold on the line here.  Yeah.  We'll read Beetle Bailey, and you explain to us why it's funny.  I'm amazed we actually found someone that still reads the comics.  I didn't think that was possible.  A man that reads Kathy.  Where are you?  I thought he was joking.  There's two of you.  Are you joking, Larry?  Are you fucking the woman who draws her?  You have the little dog.  The little dog's always ripping stuff to pieces.  She's always flustered.  Never can get anything done.  Is constantly doubting herself. 
[00:11:30]  I mean, it's not about lesbianism.  All right, sir.  All right.  Here's today's Beetle Bailey.  By the way, in today's Beetle Bailey, Beetle Bailey doesn't even appear.  There's no...  Beetle Bailey has the day off.  I think you got the sergeant and the sergeant secretary or something.  Oh, the general.  This is the general.  Oh, that's the general.  I'm sorry, right?  Oh, my God.  How dare you?  Yes, of course.  All right, sir.  There's a general and there's a little blonde girl.  Now, the little sign says, hanging on the wall, today is formal Friday.  The general says, what is formal Friday?  I never heard of it. 
[00:12:00]  And then the two of them are in the next strip and a well-dressed blonde woman, like wearing  an evening gown, walks in and says...  No, no.  Yeah, okay.  Sorry.  The blonde and the general are there.  A blonde with an evening gown walks in.  And the army blonde says, or off the woman who just walked in, it's a chance for Bucks  to wear some of her old prom dresses.  Well, I understand that.  You asshole.  You're being a dick.  All right.  Thank you.  You're not being a dick. 
[00:12:30]  I love this guy.  I love this guy now.  Larry rules.  But an asshole, he starts cracking up at that.  That kind of...  You're not understanding this.  You kind of made a dice fucking thing there.  That was a dice move.  Larry.  Larry, we like you, Larry.  You're the best, Larry.  All right.  So, officially, we still haven't found anyone that actually reads the comics every day.  No.  No.  God.  Wow.  That's just awful. 
[00:13:00]  The Lockhorns weren't as bad as some...  Lockhorns are from my hometown, so let's be careful.  I used to laugh.  Let's be careful with the Lockhorns.  Reading the Lockhorns when I was like, yeah, before I was 12.  Mean guy died, and I think the wife now freaking does the comic strip with some young artists.  They're always mad at each other.  I'm just waiting for a fucking murder-suicide on the Lockhorns.  How great would that be?  Oh, he just blasts her on the head with a shotgun, puts it in his mouth.  Well, now...  Two words.  Now I'm defending the Lockhorns, but it...  Two panels.  But the guy was from the Huntington area, and a lot of Huntington references in the Lockhorns. 
[00:13:30]  You know what's a great cartoon?  The Far Side.  Not F.A. Trials yet.  That would be nice.  The Lockhorns go there.  He fucking shoves our faces.  Wonderful chicken cutlet.  Oh, it's that other fucking joint they always use.  Fuck.  Language.  Across the street from Book Review.  I forgot the name of that joint.  Does he run into someone's drunken ex-wife?  Go Lockhorns. 
[00:14:00]  Let's see if the Lockhorns is worth reading.  Jimmy, you want to do us a favor?  The Lockhorns.  Are they all single-panel Lockhorns?  I believe so.  Yes.  I think they were.  All right, here's today's Lockhorns.  This one's not great.  It's them two talking to some marriage counselor, obviously.  Okay.  And they're both back-to-back on one seat.  And he said, first, you both need to learn to compromise.  Oh, because one of them won't take the other seat?  Yeah.  Wow.  I guess they hate each other.  My father used to like these.  Yeah.  And the two of them are staying there, and she's cooking, and he says, when did your meatloaf 
[00:14:30]  become a renewable resource?  Oh, boy.  Okay.  They're always just bitching at each other.  Oh, go ahead.  He's sitting there looking unshaven in a mess, and she said to somebody, this is Leroy's  retirement plan.  Why don't they just get a divorce?  Exactly.  It's been how many years?  Why don't they just finally let her bed in Negro, which is what she really wants?  And he could prep the ball.  Yeah.  He's a cuckold.  Leroy likes to suck before it goes in. 
[00:15:00]  I can't even read this.  It's just horrible.  Yeah.  My dad would laugh back in the day.  Yeah, in the old days.  Things used to be entertaining.  Remember Dickie Goodman got fucking radio airplay and laughs?  Yeah, right.  Because there's no relative comparisons.  Right.  Now it's...  What are you looking at?  Hey, we're getting requests now.  Someone goes, can you read Family Circus?  It's precious.  Spectro from Michigan.  Big and black.  Good old Family Circus. 
[00:15:30]  I used to love Jim Norton's fucking comic.  It just hurt my throat too much.  I love doing that, too.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, I understand.  I did like that one, though.  The Family Circus.  All right, let's try The Family Circus.  Okay.  What's this one about?  There's a couple...  There's two or three little kids.  Maybe four little kids.  Little chubby kids.  Yeah, they're little nasty fucking kids.  The Family Circus.  They're all available online.  Let's see.  This is for old people that just don't have computers. 
[00:16:00]  Let me see that one.  Don't know how to use them.  No, let's try The Family Circus.  Because you've got a dad driving the car.  The daughter.  And the daughter's in the passenger seat.  And the son's in...  He's got the visor.  You can see the shades on his face.  But the son's in her eyes.  Because she's so short.  Right.  And she adorably says,  Daddy, will you move the son, please?  Aw.  Because I guess that's what kids say.  She careens into a pole and she flies through the windshield.  Or her brother...  No, no.  Her brother is fucking her in the face.  And she says, well, you move the son, meaning his. 
[00:16:30]  See?  There'd be a lot of lofts with that.  Aw, look at the...  See the kid, just the boy, he says...  He's holding a piece of paper.  No, not knee knob.  Four words written on it.  And he says, why do I have to keep writing in these Ks when they don't make any noise anyway?  Aw, it's adorable because they're silent.  The little guy.  Kids say that type of stuff.  The darndest things.  Yeah, I love this one.  Take that out of my hiney.  Here's the...  Take that out of my hiney. 
[00:17:00]  Take your knuckles out of my hiney.  Someone's going to know what you did.  They're going to have the knowledge.  Very good.  Hey, we go to Tony in Brooklyn really fast.  Tony!  Yeah?  Hey, what's going on?  What's up, brother?  I really live in Huntington Bay, but it's Canterbury Ales, and they also reference the Golden Dolphin Diner a lot.  There you go, yeah.  Oh, the Golden Dolphin right there on Main. 
[00:17:30]  In the Lockhorns.  They reference a lot of places in Huntington.  Thank you, Tony.  I forgot.  Yeah, I forgot it was Canterbury Ales.  Very good.  Didn't know that.  That is correct, yes.  All right.  Didn't go to Canterbury that much.  Went to the Golden Dolphin.  Golden Dolphin.  Yeah.  Do you know how funny the far side was?  How funny was it?  I remember one, and it was like, he was a genius, that guy.  It was one...  Gary Larson.  It's a guy, it's two guys in a plane, and they're looking down at a guy, obviously, on a deserted island.  And he's got rocks, and the sign is H-E-L-F. 
[00:18:00]  Like, he didn't finish connecting the P.  And the guy goes, uh, cancel that.  He doesn't need...  Apparently, it's been a mistake.  This guy is saying health.  He doesn't need health.  It was some funny cartoon.  I really ruined it.  No, it was very funny.  I absolutely get that.  The guy wrote health, and they left it there.  See, those were the ones you could get the big calendar of, and every day you rip off one, and it's hysterical funny.  Yeah, but that's why the far side was so great. 
[00:18:30]  It was so much better than this horse shit that's still in the papers, like Kathy.  And he retired.  Kathy goes away in October.  Right on top, he retired, too.  Like, everybody still wanted more of that shit.  Go to Dwayne Trosley.  T-R-O-S-L-E-Y.  Who the hell is that?  That's Hustler cartoons.  Oh, yes.  Those are funny.  They're the funniest cartoons.  Yeah.  I would actually laugh until it hurt at some of those.  My favorite one ever is two hunters staring at a bear trap, and there's a pair of bloody testicles hanging in the trap. 
[00:19:00]  And the one guy goes to the other one, somewhere out there is one mean fucking bear.  I would frame that name.  That's great.  That really is great.  Look at this fucking mess.  They're just filthy.  That's billy.  No, come on.  Oh, God.  A very old naked guy in a swing.  And there's an old woman sucking his dick, and he's swinging, and she's attached to his cock, and they're in midair. 
[00:19:30]  Yeah.  And the caption is, we never would have tried this with your old denture adhesive.  And she's got a finger up his ass.  It's just filthy.  And her pussy is flopping out like a duck's mouth.  It's whistling.  Yeah, because she's old.  What is this one?  Oh.  Guy's on top of a woman in a bedroom.  Banging her in bed.  And then another woman's at the doorway all dressed.  Yes, it's Martha Stewart.  Oh, it is?  Okay.  And she says, hi, I'm Martha Stewart. 
[00:20:00]  You know, if you spit on the end of your dick, it slides into a dry pussy much easier.  But she's all proper dressed.  Give me her little tips.  Those are fucking great, man.  What's he doing?  It's a black guy, of course, with giant lips and a cock that's about four feet long, and he has a machine on the end of it.  And he's reading a book, and on the side is a box that says, penis reducer on it. 
[00:20:30]  Because black guys have big dicks.  His dick's giant.  But the machine is humming.  It's just shaving it down.  These are fucking crazy.  Hustler cartoons are the fucking funniest.  This looks like some kind of fucking orgy.  Is it all man?  Wait a minute, man.  All right.  One woman in the middle there.  They're all fucking gangbang.  Yeah.  The guy just walked in.  Yeah, guy dressed very nicely, as there's one, two, three, four, five, six, seven nude guys and one girl. 
[00:21:00]  And the black guy's got his dick in her, and there's cum all over.  She's got like ten loads on her.  Cum all over.  And the guys are getting dressed.  They're all sitting around the room, and the caption is, oh, no, my wife, my best friend, my boss, my uncle, my lawyer, my auto mechanic, my neighbor, my accountant, my dog.  I like the fact that the dog's just sitting there.  Apparently he's fucked it, too.  I love those.  Yeah, right on.  Fucking great.  I want that. 
[00:21:30]  We'll go up a little higher.  Can I carry that again?  That's great.  Oh, Chester the Molester?  Yeah.  Oh, Chester the Molester.  Oh, yeah.  Thank you, Mike at St. Louis.  Yes.  Old Chester the Molester.  You know what was a great one?  Chester was standing outside the bathroom one time, and there was toilet paper right around the corner.  First of all, you knew Chester had taken the toilet paper out and hidden it, and he had yellow and brown on his chin, and there was a little sign he had made, and it said, butts expertly cleaned. 
[00:22:00]  Chester was a great one.  Chester rules.  I love the fact they told you what had happened just by hiding the toilet paper around the corner.  Well, that's pretty smart.  A lot of creeps come up when you put Chester the Molester.  Yeah, yeah.  Hustler cartoon.  Very hard to get the comic there.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Anything come up?  Still get a bunch of molesters.  Hustler comics.  Hustler comics.  Chester the Molester in quotes, probably.  And a kiss. 
[00:22:30]  Just a lot of...  A lot of creeps.  A lot of molesters, yeah.  Yeah, a lot of real molesters popping up.  Horrible people.  I don't want to say there's one.  No.  We can't find any.  I wonder why.  Is that taboo now?  He's very greedy with his works.  Having them pulled offline.  Maybe there's a...  Sure.  Blogs about Chester the Molester.  Wow, what's up with this?  I don't know if that's... 
[00:23:00]  Oh, these are just horrible people.  Wow.  Those are real like Chester the Molesters.  Can't find them.  God, I don't want this shit out there, yo.  Huh.  You pay, motherfucker.  Well, with that...  All that from Kathy...  Kathy is leaving us.  In October.  Thank God.  I wonder what they'll fill the...  I love when you learn one of these, you know, comic people are leaving us.  And then you...  And no one cares.  And then you're in your car going, I didn't even know that they were still, you know, doing fucking comics. 
[00:23:30]  And they're usually, there's no usual references to popular culture in them, so they could probably just go back 30 years and just rerun the fucking things over again 30 years.  Or change the storyline a little bit.  A little bit.  Honestly, all that means is she's not fucking doing new ones.  Yeah.  It'll stay in the papers.  Yeah, they'll just recycle them.  No one will notice.  Who would go, I read that, Kathy, 20 years ago.

It's the best of Opie and Anthony.  Uh, Ray, Virginia.  Hey, boys.  Hey!  I got one for you.  You guys were talking about Reverend Ron the other day with how shitty his inspirational tweets are. 
[00:29:00]  LL Cool J is actually worse.  He has got one here that says,  Courage doesn't always roar.  Sometimes courage is the quiet voice at the end of the day saying,  I will try again tomorrow.  That's not courage.  Oh, that's horrible.  That's you fucking...  How about this one?  That's the explanation of failure.  Procrastinating.  You cannot push anyone up a ladder unless they are willing to climb.  Sure you can with those big LL muscles.  You can put your big fucking George Three-Fist in someone's ass and make them climb. 
[00:29:30]  What we are today...  Ladies love me!  Do they?  Hold on, hold on.  We were still talking there, Ray.  Go ahead.  Sorry, you guys go ahead.  It's your show.  Oh, damn.  All right, you guys...  What was the next one?  Now we're ready for your next one.  Okay, how about this one?  Life without love is like a tree without blossoms or fruit.  Ew.  I hate inspiration.  Wait, life without love is like a tree without blossoms or fruit?  Yeah, tell how cool, Jay, yo.  That don't make no sense.  No, not at all.  What if you hate fruit?  You don't want it dropping and rotting in your front yard.  The only person who makes no mistakes is the person who never does anything. 
[00:30:00]  Yes.  I've never made a mistake.  Yes.  I've eaten a lot of mistakes since I had my stomach mistapled.  I'm Miss Gay.  I'm Miss Hiding in the Miss Closet.  How about this one?  If you cannot work with love but only with distaste, it is better that you should leave your work. 
[00:30:30]  Oh, that sucks.  Stop it.  I want to hear honest tweets.  Worked out.  Fucked a girl in the mouth.  Took a nap with my hat on.  With my hat on.  Fuck, I hate inspirational shit from rappers.  Inspiration sucks.  Fucking stop it.  It's terrible.  Oh, Jimmy, I love this one.  Plow deep while sluggards sleep. 
[00:31:00]  Ah, see.  See, inspirational quotes are for lazy people.  It allows them to continue just being lazy.  You know what I mean?  Because you have that quote you can kind of look at like, no, man, I'm going to eventually do this.  I'm a winner, but tomorrow.  Plow deep while husbands sleep.  That would be a good one.  While they're dozing off, you're fucking oil-dericking their wife's pussy right next to them.  You're fucking making a little golf mess.  Right where there's fucking golf mess.  What are these quotes supposed to accomplish? 
[00:31:30]  Nothing.  You're supposed to read them and the people are supposed to go, wow, this person is really profound.  Get up and do your shit.  That's it.  Stop talking about it and looking up inspirational quotes and go fucking do something.  LL's tweet is not going to inspire me to do anything.  Give me one more there, Ray.  It's working.  This bit's working.  Okay, okay.  Accept responsibility for your life.  Know that it is you who will get you where you want to go.  No one else. 
[00:32:00]  But what about Whitey?  It also says, P.S.  I'm a Negro.  I hate Whitey.  Whitey's responsible for a lot of the problems.  He has 730,000 followers.  That's quite a few.  God almighty, these terrible.  The best idea will not work if you do not work the idea.  Who fucking cares?  Exactly.  Mind all my money.  Really?  Stop.  I fucking hate rapper philosophy.  The celebrities that have the most fucking followers have nothing to say to their followers. 
[00:32:30]  Nothing.  I'm obsessed with Ashton Kutcher because he was number one, now he's number two, so I started  looking at his page.  It's shit.  Why are people following him?  Oh, here's a great one.  The best job goes to the person who can get it done without passing the buck or coming back  with excuses, re-e-rock.  Why are you adding to these?  You just read them.  Yeah, they stand on their own.  I'm trying to blow the bill.  I'm trying to blow the bill.  No, they stand on their own.  You don't need to add.  You just read them, my friend. 
[00:33:00]  You just read them.  All right, all right.  We'll knock them out of the park.  Oh, this is a good one.  LL Cool J will be on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon.  Don't miss it.  Oh.  At least that wasn't a philosophy.  Yeah.  Every tomorrow has two handles.  We can take hold of it with the handle of anxiety.  Or the handle of faith.  Which one's lighter?  Exactly.  How about six, like a coffin?  Like these tweets.  Just get up and brush your fucking teeth and leave your house. 
[00:33:30]  Shut the fuck up.  That's so stupid.  I hate this shit.  Success is determined by those who prove the impossible possible.  What does this mean?  Yeah, why does it have to be impossible for you to be successful?  Success is determined by those whom...  First of all, it's not those whom, it's those who.  Who.  Those who prove the impossible possible.  Whom is wrong.  The path to success is to take massive, determined action. 
[00:34:00]  No shit.  No fucking shit.  Thank you, LL.  Wow.  These are fucking abysmal.  Does this actually inspire people to do what?  I don't know.  Fat chicks get inspired.  These, like, deep.  Like, oh, this guy's a thinker.  I'm telling you, it just allows you to continue being lazy.  Happy Mother's Day.  You're like, all right, eventually I'm going to, like, put all these inspirational quotes  together and do something with it.  How about this, Happy Mother's Day, dot, dot, dot, you deserve to be happy. 
[00:34:30]  Why do you have to make it more than it is?  How about just Happy Mother's Day?  Happy Mother's Day.  Yeah, go shit in your bra.  Here's your fucking card.  Exactly.  Happy Mother's Day.  Put on a wig, you old bags.  Can we have people shit in bras?  That would just make...  And then wear it.  Hey, shit tits.  That would make my day.  Shit tits.  We'll have a contest.  We start with the A-cups, fill up the A-cups, see if we can get up to the Ds.  Oh, boy.  A doody bra.  A doody bra.  Ah, never let your memories be greater than your dreams. 
[00:35:00]  So I guess if you get blown by two chicks, you should always think about being blown  by three.  Yeah.  That's stupid.  Dogshit Sniffer from Woodside writes, Mama says knock it off.  Yeah, you get it.  You know the LL Cool J song.  Faith is the strength by which a shattered world shall emerge into the light.  Oh, Chup, just stop it.  Chup's trying to.  What does that mean?  It's just dumb.  I would love to ask these guys, what does it mean in the end? 
[00:35:30]  I really was.  Is he twittering himself, or is that just...  A lot of these guys have...  Somebody's sending him quotes and he's just twittering them?  Or is he on the internet?  I don't know.  Looking up boring.com and just writing what they have?  Boring.  Fucking...  Twitters are horrible.  Not that mine are earth fucking...  Earth shattering, but I'm not going to fuck my girlfriend in the ass.  It's because she cut a seaweed fork.  Well, that's way better than a...  But it was true.  A special quote from LL Cool J.  She jumped in with fucking a bag of pinkberry and something from the sea falling out of  her asshole. 
[00:36:00]  Did you talk about this with her?  Did she try to leave it outside the car?  She fucking waved it at me.  Like...  Oh, she's a fucking good ad.  Like, I looked at her, I'm like, what the fuck?  And she was laughing.  She's like, what?  And then she starts waving it at me.  She's a good ad.  You found the one, Jimmy.  Yeah.  I thought she might have left it outside the car and it kind of came in with her.  No.  She's a professional.  No, she didn't trail it.  She waited until the door was closed.  All right.  Hey, thanks for the bit, man.  Okay, boys.  Punch it up.  All right.  LL with more inspiration. 
[00:36:30]  I'm so upset over it.  Inspiration.  Yeah.  It means nothing.  Inspiration is better than being outside of spiration.  What?  What are you guys talking about?  See, you could write inspirational tweets.  Yeah.  Do that.  Yeah, I should be inspirational, Jimmy.  You should try that for a day.  Go ahead.  Yeah.  I like the one, inspiration and outspiration.  Yeah, from now on, only inspirational tweets.  Yeah.  No more negativity. 
[00:37:00]  Because if your mind is all negativity, negativity is under your hat.  That's a good one.  What's different from that than anyone else's?  Yeah, that's inspirational.  Just as good.  That's right.  From now on, only inspirational tweets.  Mine are all negative.  Somebody said, Anthony, 80% of your tweets are negative and 20% are racist.  Or hateful.  Yeah.  And I was like, wow, that person did it.  Why the negativity on Twitter, Anthony?  I know all of them.  Where is that bitch today?  Why the negativity? 
[00:37:30]  You know, Anthony, you should really look at your tweets and realize that there's anger  there that should be...  Shut the fuck up.  Why the negativity?  Because there's nothing worth tweeting except negative shit.  The shit that pisses you off.  If you're pissed at something, if you read someone else's Twitter and you're like, you're  a fucking asshole, like that, what am I going to tweet about?  Oh, I've seen a bird today.  This is nice.  You had a nice tweet about the Blue Angels. 
[00:38:00]  You were excited about that?  I did, but I also said I'd rather pay my tax money to these fighter aircraft than to housing  projects.  So it was a little like, oh, why'd you have to say that?  I said, because they're cool to watch.  Oh, yeah, because you could edit with F-A-18s over...  Yeah, over my head.  Oh, okay.  Over my head.  You missed the whole word there.  Yeah, I know.  That happens.  It happens.  Over my head makes me not mind taxes so much.  I'd rather pay for one of these than a housing project. 
[00:38:30]  Yeah.  Like, I don't want my tax money.  I want it to go to fighter aircraft.  They're amazing.  That is a cool picture, though.  Fuck.  Goddamn.  What did that sound like when I went over the boat?  Unbelievable.  They are amazing.  They're so fucking loud when they come over you.  Like, they'll fly in front of you, kind of, and then one came right over our head, and  then the rear, obviously, the rear of the plane is facing you.  The sound is like a rocket engine taking off.  And it delays, too.  The loudest plane does not inspire as much as the quietest bird. 
[00:39:00]  Exactly.  Fuck, I love it.  Oh, God, I hate inspirational Jimmy.  No, not inspirational.  Inspirational Jimmy is going to brighten your day.  Look at this.  Just shut up, Jimmy.  Inspirational.  An up that is shut is not as good as an up that is open.  Ah.  I'm going to be inspirational.  I know I don't acknowledge Chip, but you know what?  I'm going to fucking embrace inspirational Jimmy.  That one I can embrace, Jimmy.  Yeah.  I love it.  True.  Because they're fucking horseshit, like the real ones. 
[00:39:30]  What is that, a big fucking circle?  They got far away.  The planes get so far away so quickly.  And then, you got sound?  Can you hear the engines?  Here's a...  Oh.  How the fuck do they do that?  Yeah, just about touching.  Yeah.  And it said 18 inches apart.  What?  Yeah.  18 inches apart, and they're doing their maneuvers. 
[00:40:00]  They're 18 inches apart?  Yeah.  Some maneuvers are 18 inches, wingtip to wingtip.  And then...  No!  Yeah, no shit.  And then one of the planes was doing 450 miles an hour right at the level of the beach.  It just...  And all I can think is, you know what that's got to look like from the cockpit?  Just like 450 miles an hour down the beach.  How do they not just crash all the time?  I know.  They do sometimes.  Flying upside down.  Fucking next to each other.  Boy, this guy's not flying for continental any time soon. 
[00:40:30]  Wow, Chip.  That's good.  Look at that perfectly synchronized barrel roll with four of them all together.  Yeah.  One of these fucking planes, right?  Yeah.  I don't know if you even know the answer.  New York to L.A.  How fast would they do it?  That thing...  Because we're used to what?  A five and a half hour fucking flight?  Going 500 miles an hour.  Yeah.  What would they do?  Two and a half.  You can make that in a couple hours.  Maybe 42 minutes?  You can make that in a couple hours.  Two hours, you're thinking?  Yeah.  Wow.  Can you imagine? 
[00:41:00]  That would be great.  Yeah, yeah.  You could fucking go to L.A. for dinner, come back and be in your own bed.  No problem.  Yeah.  That is just insanity.  But to rush to a destination is to abandon a place.  That you've been.  Those are just as good.  It's just as good slash shit as any other inspirational thing.  Oh, no.  Inspirational, Jimmy.  I feel so good now.  It's just the worst.  That's right.  Oh, I hate inspirational, Jimmy.  Because I know I'm just going to read these tweets. 
[00:41:30]  Holy shit, is that good.  It's to abandon a place, but it is.  Maybe we get a little box of inspirational quotes in studio.  I like inspirational quotes.  Oh, that's good.  I've always been obsessed with how fucking awful they are.  Because they're not inspiring anybody.  And inspire Jimmy to make inspirational quotes.  That's right.  I'm inspirational, Jimmy.  That's good.  Yeah.  One who doesn't inspire will perspire. 
[00:42:00]  Into the heat.  You got my endorsement, inspiration, Jimmy.  I'm all in on this one.  I love how inspirational Jimmy and hate him all at the same time.  That's right.  That's right.  That's right.  Anything for people that are feeling a little depressed about this oil slick?  Because I know a lot of people are not very happy with it.  It kind of weighs them down.  The environment is getting messed up.  Everything's getting heavy.  Anything? 
[00:42:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Like the oil.  They shouldn't call it oil slick.  Because anybody slick wouldn't let the oil spill to begin with.  Oh, yeah.  See, that's inspirational.  It's real.  You got to see them.  I don't feel like filming today.  I'll film inspirational Jimmy tomorrow.  Because the hand movements really go with it.  Yeah, there are hand movements.  Jimmy's being very overly dramatic.  And his face, his nose crinkles up and he squints a little.  He's almost like Billy Crystal doing a doodly-eyed time. 
[00:43:00]  He's very...  You don't like that bitch?  Ugh!  Well, Katrina took away everything I knew.  Can you dig it?  I knew you could.  George Bush didn't send nobody when Katrina hit.  And now we're just sitting here living as best we can.  Shut up, you white Jew. 
[00:43:30]  You're not a black guy.  You're not even coming close to being a black guy.  Don't make everyone try to think you know what the hardships of the black man are.  You dumb bit.  Someone who tries to be a black guy is going to get a black guy.  Yes, inspirational Jimmy.  You know what, Ant?  You hate that bit, but with the fucking oil spill in the Gulf, there's going to be another one coming.  Because that's affecting Louisiana.  Yeah.  It's starting to affect that fine state.  And I saw oil washing up on the wetlands. 
[00:44:00]  The beautiful wetlands where the Louisiana duck and the Louisiana snake would play together.  Can you dig it?  I knew that you could.  But I notice you're looking at your watch wondering, why is this fucking shit bit going on for 35 minutes?  Oh, God.  The birds.  Everyone hated it. 
[00:44:30]  The boys.  When the Louisiana boys would sing their song.  Oh, and now Mr. Obama looks like Mr. Bush, but in the oil spill.  In the oil spill.  It's the same thing, only he covered with oil.  A boodly-a-da-da.  A toodly-doo.  Hey, we got a name for inspirational Jimmy. 
[00:45:00]  What your inspirational quotes could be called.  Yes, Brandon in Texas.  You should call it Jimspirations.  Jimspirations.  I like it.  Jimspirations.  I like them.  I hope we get one more Jimspirations before we leave today.  Jimspirations.  Jimspirations.  Jimspirations.  Jimspirations, yeah.  Maybe we have a question for them.  Maybe the oil one was good.  Yeah, they are just like kind of a natural thing.  They just kind of flow.  I know.  Because that's what inspiration is.  Yeah.  It's about the moment. 
[00:45:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Changing of the seasons.  Summer is upon us.  Some people get down when the seasons change, I'm thinking.  Too hot out, right?  Yeah.  A little too hot.  They're not used to the humidity.  Makes you want to talk like that, too, doesn't it?  Yeah.  Slow everything down.  Yeah.  Take a look around you.  And I came back in my house.  It was just gone. 
[00:46:00]  And I said, Mr. Bush, Mr. Bush, why ain't you here to help us?  I see the boys.  I see the snakes.  I see the crickets.  But I don't see Mr. Bush.  Can you dig it?  I knew that you could.  You got anything for the...  Die!  You got anything for the shrimp industry?  It's suffering down there.  Oh.  In the Gulf of Mexico. 
[00:46:30]  A lot of people making their livelihood from the shrimp.  The boat's coming back with shrimp that wouldn't even be good for the red lobster.  They serve some pretty shitty shrimp down there, don't they?  Boo-doo-doo-doo-doo!  Ugh.  They don't need good shrimps for that.  Because that's what the...  Think a good place is to take dates.  Yeah, for some reason...  Loved the red lobster. 
[00:47:00]  And they dig the Olive Garden's real Italian food.  Can you dig it?  I knew that you could.  And Golden Corral.  Oh, they love the Golden Corral.  That's fine dining for all the out there.  I've learned something.  They like the Olive Garden out there?  Oh, they love the Olive Garden.  I knew about the red lobster, but not the Olive Garden.  They didn't get the Olive Garden, too, did they? 
[00:47:30]  School you about by.  We're eating Italian tonight.  And she go, where are we eating?  And I say, the Olive Garden.  Because we's...  Can you dig that?  Can you dig it?  I knew that you could.  Where Mr. Bush?  I've seen him at the Olive Garden.  They're only not there.  Notice I didn't say white person.  You didn't like the Mr. Bush line?  I blame Mr. Bush for everything. 
[00:48:00]  Mr. Bush, why did the levees break?  And flood our wonderful chocolate city.  Why did you break the levees?  And he said, I wasn't even born when they were built, motherfucker.  Shut up.  I'm busy.  Wait till your president comes in.  And maybe he could fix your whole city.  Hey, you...  I go to Red Lobster and feed that fat wife of yours. 
[00:48:30]  Like it's a real restaurant, Scooby-Boo-Doo.  I thought...  When I first heard about it, I thought it was the levees broke.  I was going to yell at Bobby over here a song.  Chip, that's a hot one.  Yes.  Ew.  Someone on the line has a gymspiration.  Mike in Missouri has a gymspiration.  Yes, Mike.  The more they break the levees, the more they will build up our endurance. 
[00:49:00]  What a douche, Joe.  That's just uncomfortable.  Oh, it really is.  Yeah?  Yeah, they're uncomfortable.  I don't like them.  They make me feel bad.  They're not inspirational.  The more you flood us with water, we will flood you right back with love and understanding.  Let's go to Mike in Missouri.  Well, Mike has a gymspiration for you, Mike.  Hey, Jimmy.  Yes.  You have to take time to inspire before you expire. 
[00:49:30]  Ah.  That's very inspiring.  That's right.  That's right.  Gymspiration is going to be huge.  Money is only a tool.  Use it to build selfishness or happiness.  I hate that they're exactly like you'd read on someone's shitty fucking site.  Yeah.  Oh, you're horrible.  He goes, oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  A nightmare is just a dream that hasn't been attempted. 
[00:50:00]  Oh, God.  They come naturally to them, though, Anthony.  Yeah.  Yeah.  People are yelling, stop, we get it.  That's right.  And Anthony's new bet is called Jigspiration, according to Jordan.  Oh, no.  It's the OB and Anthony show's best of O&A.  We'll be right back.  Don't go anywhere.  Hi, I'm Maria Bartiromo.

[00:54:30]  A Bowen Day High.  Let's do this.  O.P. and Anthony, Amy Schumer in studio.  Hello, hello.  And right off the bat, she walks in seconds ago and says, I'm fucked up.  You're dealing with a really bad sunburn.  Yes, I am.  Which happens in the summertime.  I didn't know that sunblock could expire.  I know condoms can expire, milk, the important shit.  But I had no idea.  My mucinex expired.  But it seemed to, you know, still get the phlegm off.  I just thought that was just a ploy. 
[00:55:00]  To get you to buy more of the stuff after a certain amount of time.  I look like an albino child that saw sun for the first time.  I like when you get a sunburn and then you don't remember for that second.  You have a sunburn and you scratch yourself.  And then it's that five-second delay.  And the pain.  Right.  Oh.  The pain.  So you're a bit stiff?  I'm a little stiff.  You can't really move around?  Not really.  Can you pat her on the back, Jimmy?  Oh, that's okay.  Good to see you, Amy.  It's good to see you. 
[00:55:30]  Oh, man.  Next time, you're up in Utica.  Oh, God.  Is that where you're from?  Yeah.  Utica.  Would you take a pat to the back?  I missed the opening.  I was out.  She's got a really bad sunburn.  Sunburn.  Where were you?  Long Beach.  Okay.  Yeah.  Long Beach is where?  Long Island?  Long Island, yeah.  That's a nice little area.  It's a nice place to get sunburned.  Like California.  No.  She used suntan lotion that was expired.  Does it expire, though?  Yes.  And I guess when it expires, it doesn't really work. 
[00:56:00]  I'm going to spread the word now.  That's going to be my cause.  Did you lay out?  No, I was surfing.  Really?  You surf?  Yeah.  I have a bad surfing injury on my leg.  What's your injury?  I skagged myself.  My whole fin went into my board when I was 17.  I had to pull it out.  What's that mean?  Well, you know, just what I said.  You skagged yourself?  Yeah, it's called skagging yourself.  Well, the fin of my board went all the way into my leg, and I just thought I was going  to have a bad bruise, and then I pulled it out, and the water all around me got red. 
[00:56:30]  Holy shit.  Yeah.  It was pretty disgusting.  And then I was like, oh, sharks.  Let me get out of here.  Do you know Laszlo?  He surfs down there.  Oh, no.  Yeah, he does.  Well, maybe I do.  Are you good at surfing?  Apparently not.  She's poking her leg.  That's pretty cool.  I'm fucking myself up.  Yeah.  How bad does the leg look now?  It looked really bad at first.  Now the scar is small.  It looks like a vagina.  Oh, cool.  It's just, I want to give people options.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, you're bored with that whole, look what mama got. 
[00:57:00]  It must look really good when it first happened.  Oh, it was so.  Put a tampon in there.  It was so disgusting.  And actually, when it was like healing, I did, I used a maxi pad to, like when I went  back to play volleyball.  Big bandage.  Yeah, it worked.  Yeah.  It worked.  But I didn't know.  It was 41 stitches in three layers.  And I didn't know.  They didn't tell me what the other layers are.  I thought it was all just the same kind of stitch.  And after a volleyball tournament, I took the bandage off, and I saw a worm kind of creep 
[00:57:30]  out of my leg and move around.  Get the plug out of here.  And I was like, oh my God, it happened in the ocean.  Like, maybe there's some sort of a, so we rushed to the hospital, and the doctor looks,  and he's like, oh my God.  And then he's like, oh, it's a suture.  I didn't know what that was.  I was like, oh, some sort of a fucking African.  A suture worm?  But it was, no, it was just an internal stitch that grows out.  But I was like, just amputate.  Just take it.  Take it.  Take my leg off now.  It was horrible.  Oh, creepy.  You're not creeped out, though, by the ocean, I guess, because there's monsters in there.  Sometimes I freak out.  Oh, you do? 
[00:58:00]  Monsters.  Yeah.  Surfers usually don't freak out.  You, like, pull your feet and arms up and just, like, lose it for a minute?  Yeah.  I will.  Sometimes when I'm surfing, I'll freak out.  No, I'm not scared of monsters in the water.  I'd be.  You know, and you know it's going to be all white people in there.  It's like different things you embrace when you're...  There's no purse snatchings in the water.  And it would never go swimming over his head.  No?  Really?  No.  What are you afraid of?  No, my head, but there's such big monsters in the ocean.  They're shitless of you. 
[00:58:30]  And you can't see them.  They're just down there.  What monsters?  What are you talking about?  Big fish.  All you have to do is they're big, like, fish things.  All you have to do is...  Not even sharks.  I'm talking, like, just fish that are, like, two feet long are big, scary things.  They don't come near you.  Like, I've never heard of anybody getting...  All you have to do, Anthony, is go scuba diving one time and you realize everything is  scared shit.  I've gone scuba diving.  You have?  No, no.  It's snorkeling.  Snorkeling.  That's it.  That's it.  I've gone snorkeling.  All right.  I'm a faggot.  You know what?  My pool is nice.  It's very warm and there's nothing in there. 
[00:59:00]  Occasionally, a monster's in there during some parties.  They don't want to check you out.  They want to swim away.  Yeah, they're not interested.  Nope.  We're boring.  Yeah, yeah.  Tell that...  I watched Shark Week.  I saw what happened.  Those are all accidents.  They bump into you and they bite and realize they don't watch you and they go.  I listen to these fucking hypocritical, two-faced, two-sided shows.  One show you watch during Shark Week is like, and the shark really doesn't find humans tasty.  They poke and taste and release when they realize it's bad. 
[00:59:30]  And then another show is like, the deadliest creature in the ocean is the shark.  There's thousands of them right here in our area that could eat me at any time.  They're very rare.  You never even see a shark.  They're almost on the verge of extinction.  Here I am amongst thousands of man-eating sharks.  Like, every other show was one where we're the bad guy killing the sharks off.  And then the next show was how dangerous.  I'm in a cage and he bashed through the cage and holy shit, it's Shark Week.  That's all ratings crap.  I get very scared. 
[01:00:00]  Yeah.  Sharks don't want us.  They don't want us.  Very scared of the ocean.  Manly.  I like, you know what I like?  I like going to the Bahamas and having a coconut drink on the beach.  Right.  And then I'll go walking up my ankle deep.  You go wading.  That's nice.  Ankle deep.  That's nice.  It's nice.  The water's warm.  I can watch things.  It's like surfing.  Yeah.  That's just like, it's like the same thing.  I'll jet ski.  I like to jet ski.  Aren't you freaked out when you jet ski?  I mean, you're out there pretty far.  If I fall off, I go like, and I swim as fast as I can to get back to the jet ski.  And I just, I anticipate like something biting me and it freaks me out. 
[01:00:30]  Let me give you a scenario.  A North Shore beach on Long Island.  Yeah.  It's night when you swim out to like a buoy over your head.  Get the fuck out of here.  Why not?  It started to sound sexy.  Like, I thought you were setting up a rally.  Yeah.  Night.  Like I'm Chrissy.  Picture tiger lilies.  We used to swim at night and we'd be scared shitless because it's night.  What's the fucking difference?  Why would you do that when you could just be drinking?  During the day, you will swim out through these buoys like it's nothing. 
[01:01:00]  At night, you know, there's always dares going on.  It's like, what's the difference?  It is amazing you're nervous about swimming.  Obviously.  But you will fucking drink a 12-pack and then get behind the wheel of an Escalade.  Do a fucking 110 on the LA.  Allegedly.  Opie, I want to ask you a question.  What did you swim out to?  A buoy?  Bubble buoy.  Bubble buoy.  Bubble buoy.  Got it?  Yuck.  19 what?  Oh, yuck.  What else is going on, Amy?  You got the sunburner?  It's safer that way.  Danny, pat Amy Schumer on the back. 
[01:01:30]  No, that's okay.  What?  Hey, how are you?  Nice to see you.  You look thinner.  Not that you needed to lose weight, but you'll be able to lose weight.  Oh, nice addition to that.  What a half of a compliment.  That really is a backhand.  You look like you've lost cellulite in your face.  She's my friend.  No.  You're not supposed to ever say that.  But Amy looked like she lost weight.  It's a good thing.  Thank you.  You do look like you lost a lot of weight.  Yeah, I've been dabbling with an eating disorder.  Oh, atta girl.  Yeah, thanks.  Very cool.  You got my anonymous emails.  I did.  I did.  Which one?  The one where you just don't eat or the pukey one?  No, I'm just kidding.  Yeah.  Off the record, both. 
[01:02:00]  Yeah, no, I've just been purging.  I like the not eating one for girls more than the pukey one.  I get so hungry so fast.  In college, I was like, I'm not.  I got to do this.  I got to develop an eating disorder.  Binge and purge.  An hour later, yeah, I was like, I'm starving.  This is horrible.  I ate a sub to make up for lost time.  But no, I've been, I don't know.  I guess it's summer.  I noticed because of your sweatshirt.  She has a fused sweatshirt on.  Yeah.  Because she got it.  No, it's good, actually.  And that's why I noticed it looks like it makes you look very thin.  I'm like, she fucking, she lost weight. 
[01:02:30]  And then I realized she got a TV show.  I'm going to be wearing this sweatshirt all the time now.  People are like, what's going on with your sweatshirt?  It might be the sunburn.  It might be the sunburn.  The sunburn might make you look a little thinner.  I'm going to do this.  This is what I'm going to rock from now on.  A terrible sunburn.  And the braid pigtails help, too.  Yeah?  It's all thinning me out?  It gives it that junior high look.  And it's all working.  My plans are working.  Yeah, the pigtails work very well on you.  Oh, good.  Amy's fucking hot.  Great.  Put some fake braces and put those in.  Amy's hot.  It's really dirty things on stage. 
[01:03:00]  She's very dirty.  Oh, God.  She's a dirty bird.  I am.  And you know what?  Here's what's dangerous.  I, for the past month and a half, I'm newly single.  Uh-oh.  And I'm like, I haven't been single.  I, like, have gone from boyfriend to boyfriend for a while.  So it's like the highway to the danger zone right now.  I'm just like, oh, shit.  Oh, no.  Yeah.  Get some banging in.  It's brutal.  You've got to take some time for yourself.  That's what I'm calling it.  Time for myself.  It's that relationship to relationship thing is just a pain in the ass. 
[01:03:30]  Yeah.  I was so scared.  I was, like, scared to not be in a relationship.  Yeah.  Partially because I don't want to jump back on the whore train.  But, you know, all aboard.  No.  Choo-choo.  But then, yeah, you're, like, you're, like, scared.  I was scared of being.  Choo-choo.  I was scared.  I was, like, oh, God, what if I get really lonely?  And then you're, like, oh, this isn't that bad.  This is good.  No, it's kind of, like, nice.  Yeah.  You know, you're just even doing nothing.  Right.  Would you be jealous if you saw him with a girl or no? 
[01:04:00]  Yeah.  Oh, yeah?  I think so.  Yeah.  Part of me feels, like, totally jealous and part of me doesn't give a shit.  You know?  Yeah.  Like, I'm always, like, I don't know.  There have been times where I'm, like, I would like to see him with another chick.  And sometimes where that thought would make me sick.  People want us to tweet a picture of Amy, but she's got sunburned.  Oh, man.  You guys are just telling me how great I look.  And now you're, like, nobody wants to see this.  Nobody knows what Amy looks like.  Nobody needs to see this.  Yeah, but they need new spank material.  Oh, good.  It doesn't matter how old the pictures are.  You always need new pictures.  Can we rub vinegar on your sunburn? 
[01:04:30]  Oh, no.  That's okay.  Oh, no.  Really?  You don't want to make your figure?  Oh, God.  No.  No.  No.  I'll let you approve it before I Twitter it.  I feel like the ghost of Christmas albino.  You can't approve.  Oh, no, it's video.  Oh, that's even worse.  You can't approve the one I did.  By accident and take a video or something.  You want to take a glamour shot?  Oh, I really shouldn't.  All right.  You want to take a glamour shot?  Oh, you want to do that?  All right.  Hold on.  I hate pictures.  One, two.  Glamour shot.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Yeah, there it is. 
[01:05:00]  Oh, you can rule.  I usually hate pictures.  All right, I'll tweet it.  Yeah, you should.  Because look at the awful font.  It's all blurry.  Oh, no.  I don't know how to spell Schumer.  Oh, God.  I look like a sunburned nightmare.  Amy's cute, man.  He's really cute.  That's a good picture.  Hey, Amy, what's your...  I follow you, but I don't know offhand.  Oh, at Amy Schumer.  A-M-Y-S-C-H-U-M-E-R.  Wait.  Uh, what?  A-M-Y-S-C-H-U-M-E-R.  A-M-Y-what?  S-C-H.  Somebody get a Biscantron. 
[01:05:30]  U-M-E-R.  U-M-E-R.  Yeah.  What?  Okay.  I bet you get pretty sunburned.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  I'm bad.  Yeah.  I'm bad.  Have they all been white?  Me?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Hey, I want to keep my stock right where it is.  No Dominicans?  No.  I've never dabbled in that stuff.  But, but, but, but honestly, yeah, but I, it's, it's interesting because fantasizing  and looking at porn, it's, it's all over the map.  It's a virtual U-M. 
[01:06:00]  Yeah.  Everything.  Yeah.  But, but, yeah, but, uh, when it comes down to it, I've, I've been pretty, at the cellar,  Keith called me pure uncut cocoa.  So, wait, you can watch black on blonde porn and not be uncomfortable, but in real life  it's like, eh.  Yeah, in real life I've just never, uh, I've never, if it's come down to it, I've been  like, oh, I think I gotta go home.  I don't know.  I can't.  I can't.  But, uh, but yeah, I like that porn.  What do you like about it?  The taboos part of it?  I don't know.  Because I can watch it once in a while.  I go back and forth. 
[01:06:30]  Yeah.  I either really, really hate it or it's tolerable.  It's just Danny.  Amy, you like that?  That's a fucking.  Oh, that's great.  She looks excited.  That is a giant.  She's like, is this thing on?  It's a fake penis.  You like that?  Come on.  Oh, you'll get a real one?  I'll get a real one.  Thank you.  What a sweetheart.  The last time I looked over, it was pictures of me.  Do you like that?  She's so surprised.  Yeah, that would scare the shit out of me.  There's a girl, there's a giant black penis in the foreground.  That's forced perspective.  Yeah, it really is. 
[01:07:00]  I like that he's wearing a Livestrong bracelet.  Is that, is that the message that Lance is trying to get out there?  Wraps around his shaft and balls when he wants to last longer.  What gets you with those pills, Lance?  A huge black dick.  A funny good one?  Yeah, that's a good one.  Oh, boy.  What makes a good one?  A good one.  I'm glad you asked.  Tears and a father hanging himself.  Oh, man.  That kind of porno, not my cup of tea.  No? 
[01:07:30]  You can't.  I can't get past my own racism.  But don't you just like to watch porn and be mad sometimes?  No, no, not that kind of porn.  Any other porn is fine by me.  Really?  The interracial stuff gets me like, oh, God, because I just start thinking about, oh, the  poor family.  I like the dirtiness of it.  I like the fact that a girl likes it.  Really?  It doesn't turn me on to watch it.  It's about watching Cuba Goody Jr. be fucking the ass fight.  It's two gangster guys going at it.  Gay black porn.  Favorite part of Jerry Maguire. 
[01:08:00]  Oh, wow.  That is really bad.  You guys don't like homo thugs?  Homo thugs?  Is that the name?  One blood.  One crip.  Two cocks.  You want a sunburn remedy?  Beth in Indiana.  Sunburn remedy for Amy Schumer.  Okay.  Hi, Amy.  Hey, Beth.  I am a ginger.  You're a what?  Ginger.  She has red hair and freckles.  I'm like, is that some sexual?  She's hated.  Okay. 
[01:08:30]  Good talk, Beth.  Good talk, Beth.  Beth, what do you say?  No, let's just cut our losses.  I don't know what she was going to say.  Amy, where are you playing, by the way?  Texas, huh?  Yeah, this weekend, just Friday, I'm at Nagadocious, Texas.  Now we're outside Houston.  So you're almost in Houston.  That's good.  Yeah.  The career is rocking.  Yeah, like, it's going in the right direction.  I hope next year to be an hour from Fort Worth.  And then eventually, I'll get to Dallas.  All right.  Yeah, and then...  Hotel Fredonia. 
[01:09:00]  Hotel Fredonia.  What is it?  Hotel Fredonia.  I don't know.  I don't know.  It's one night.  One night only.  But you also just shot an episode for Curb.  Yeah.  Was that cool?  Yeah, it was really cool.  Who do you play?  I don't know.  Am I allowed to say that?  Did...  I think it's pretty...  We don't know what you're saying.  Bobby Kelly.  What did Bobby tell you?  And he said, just shut up.  Oh, good.  Okay.  Yeah.  Then I'll follow his lead.  Oh, Bobby Kelly shot for Curb?  Yeah.  We're in the same episode.  Oh, I didn't know.  Okay.  That's cool.  Yeah.  He said, I can't say anything.  They tell you to shut up.  They tell you to shut up and sign something. 
[01:09:30]  Right.  We shot the same day, but not at the same time.  Okay.  How's Larry?  Awesome.  Is he cool?  Yeah.  I really liked him.  Yeah.  Because I think Bobby said something stupid to him.  Yeah, I think so, too.  I saw him.  He gets...  He could get mad.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But we hit it off, so...  Cool, Larry?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Like, I got to be on the set for a couple days, and just...  It was hilarious.  He's really funny.  That's because you're hot.  Is that what it was?  Yeah.  I'll take it.  I thought he only needed you for a couple hours or something.  Right.  They're like, throw her another line.  I want to look at her ass again. 
[01:10:00]  I'm like, great.  That sounds great.  Where do you film that?  They're shooting five episodes in New York, so it's here.  Yeah.  Wow, that is cool.  Damn.  I love that show.  It's very good.  It was a blast.  What's your new show?  Different Spin with Mark Hoppus.  Isn't he like a Blink guy?  Yeah, he's in Blink.  Has he been here?  He must have been.  I don't think he has.  Oh, no?  Yeah, he's awesome.  Cool.  It's going to be on the Fuse Network,  and we start shooting in like a week.  Oh, you have? 
[01:10:30]  Okay.  That's why the Fuse hoodie today.  Yeah.  Sorry, I didn't unpack yet.  I was just in L.A. doing stuff for it.  What's the show going to be about?  It's like everything music.  You know music?  No.  I did this critics thing that they have in L.A.,  and they were like, and Mark is on tour and couldn't be there,  and they were just like firing questions at me,  and I was like, they were like,  what are your favorite bands?  And I was like, just Britney.  And they were like, what?  No, I like, you know, I'm half up on music, I would say.  But I'm not like.  How did you get through the audition? 
[01:11:00]  Did they ask you a lot?  What was the audition?  The audition first, it was just kind of like.  Lay down here.  Yeah.  They inspected me.  It was a medical situation.  I was like, I've seen this.  For insurance.  I've seen this movie.  The guy's like, here, you hold the camera for a minute.  And then I tested with Mark twice.  We went in, and we hit it off, like, right away.  What did you test?  You talking about music?  I would be so bad at that.  I interviewed a couple musicians.  I think they wanted to see, from, like, kind of younger bands, 
[01:11:30]  like a band taking back Sunday, Starship.  I don't know.  I really don't know the bands.  I'm like, I really like Neil Young.  They're like, great.  Yeah, it's a job.  But they know that I'm there to be the comic relief.  I can't believe they used me, because I just said the worst shit ever in my audition.  They were like, what do you think about Wu-Tang?  And I was like, well, I went to a concert once.  It was like they opened up a cell block and gave everyone a mic.  And they were like, you're hired.  I was like, really?  That's all it's talking.  Yeah.  No, but the fact that they picked me, I feel like they want it to be, 
[01:12:00]  they want it to be like a show that people are going to, you know, be interested in.  It's not just going to be like TRL, complimenting everyone.  Well, Fuse TV, September 16th.  Yeah.  Thank you.  It was very cool, man.  I'm excited to have a job.  It's always these one nights at Hotel Fredonia's.  Well, speaking of that, a guy wants to offer you a ride.  Oh.  And I think you should take him up on it.  That's nice.  Let's go to Todd in Detroit.  You're on with Amy Schumer.  Hey, boys.  Amy.  Hey, Todd.  Hey, I can give you an idea of Texas, but it's gas, grass, or ass. 
[01:12:30]  I didn't hear that, but it sounds interesting.  Wait, what'd you say?  Gas, grass, or ass.  That's the only way I can get you to Texas.  What do you mean?  Gas, grass.  Nobody rides for free.  I heard you.  No one rides for free.  Dumb bumper sticker.  I'll take grass.  Thank you.  Anthony, one question.  What?  Is it the blowjob before the jacuzzi?  What do you mean?  That's referencing Mel Gibson.  Oh, you son of a bitch. 
[01:13:00]  I'm falling for that one.  What do you mean?  He's gone.  It's the immediate rapport you guys form with your fans.  Yeah.  I think draw people.  It's always been one of our big strengths here on our show is our rapport.  He's referencing the Mel Gibson thing.  Yes.  Have you been following the Mel Gibson tapes?  It's why I'm alive.  It's kind of old news now, but.  It's making me believe in God again.  Yeah.  Whose side are you on?  Mel's.  I love every moment of those tapes.  I want more. 
[01:13:30]  I'm like, please, Lord, hear our prayer.  More.  Like every day when they were coming in, we were just like, oh my God, this is the best  thing.  It's the greatest.  I miss them.  It was like when I watched The Wire.  That's what I live for.  And now it's Mel.  I'm hoping they're unreleased.  It's got to be.  I want more.  He would just come up with the greatest things.  That anger and the, just the wackiness of.  So weird.  What did he call her?  A glum.  A glum cunt.  A glum cunt.  How great is that?  So creative.  I'll put that. 
[01:14:00]  Two four letter words.  One's dirty.  One's not.  Somebody needs to rewatch what women want.  Yeah.  And I heard The Wire in there.  We can't get enough of that damn show.  I can't.  I met Stringer Bell.  Yeah.  In LA.  Yeah.  Got his digits.  How'd you meet him?  He was at the critic thing I was at.  Yeah.  He has a show on the BBC coming out.  And I was thinking, we're talking.  I'm thinking, will you be the first?  Just thinking.  I mean, if you're going to, why not have it be Stringer Bell?  Is he handsome in person?  Yeah. 
[01:14:30]  Yeah.  And he like has an accent.  He's British.  Yeah.  Where are you from?  Staten Island?  What is that?  Hoboken?  He probably banged it.  Thank you.  That'll still ruin you.  I'm going to continue doing Pilates until it's an option.  That'll ruin you.  That'll ruin me.  Yeah.  Well, that'll ruin you.  You know what?  That's so funny.  If it came down to it, you know, it's like the end of the night.  It's night, as you were describing before.  And it's about to happen.  I'll just picture you guys sitting here like, don't do it.  No, no, no.  Don't do it.  No.  Everybody just, white people forever bully your vagina. 
[01:15:00]  We're giant cock blocking.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It takes all three of us.  It's like a battering ram on a door.  Just trying to pour hot oil on it.  Make him stop.  So, all right.  So you're on a tear.  I don't know much about Amy's personal life.  I really don't.  As much as we work together, I don't spend a lot of...  Why?  Why don't you guys get to know each other a little bit?  She's a good friend of mine.  We're usually making fun of Kenny. 
[01:15:30]  Yeah.  You know, she's got her thing and I got my girlfriend.  She's got her life and whatever.  She likes to drink a little.  She likes to gamble a little.  I've never seen Amy in Predator mode.  I've never seen you in that mode.  Predator mode.  Yeah.  I've never seen you like that.  Because on the road, she was always...  She's like shoplifting.  That's right.  You're a thief.  You're a thief.  Yeah.  At the end of the day, I would not put myself in the category as a good person.  Yeah.  I don't remember what I realized about what a horrible person she'd be to fall in love with.  I saw your face change.  You kind of took in like, oh, you're a total cunt. 
[01:16:00]  Yes.  I don't think she is, though.  Oh, she is.  But I mean, not in a bad way.  No, no.  No, she's a good friend.  She's a kook.  Amy's a fucking very Manchurian candidate.  Really?  Really?  I think of myself as the interpreter.  Fuck.  Let's get to know her more.  She did the shoplifting bit for us.  Not a bit.  I mean, it's real life.  It's facts.  What else can you tell us about you that we haven't heard yet?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Were you raised rich or poor or middle class? 
[01:16:30]  Oh, I was raised really rich until I was like 11.  And then we were just so poor.  Didn't we talk about that last night?  Yeah.  I don't know.  Yeah.  I think we did.  Something happened to the fortune.  Something happened to the Schumer fortune.  The Schumer fortune.  Oh, your dad made...  My dad.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He made Schumers.  He made small Schumers.  What do you mean?  Oh, my God.  Dad?  Invest in some horrible things.  Is that what happened?  Yeah.  Well, it was just baby furniture from Italy.  Nobody else was doing it.  And all the rich men had it. 
[01:17:00]  Moms were like, we need a crib from Milan.  And then other people were like, well, we're going to do it, too.  And my dad just ate shit.  So a lot of people got involved with it?  Or began doing it?  Yeah.  And his furniture wasn't made in Italy?  It was made in Italy.  I'm telling you, this is going to be a black hole.  I don't care.  And now he has MS.  He's in a wheelchair.  And I have to go, oh, my God.  I love Jim's serious face.  Jim, all expression. 
[01:17:30]  He nods like he's saying, yes, Father.  But really inside, he's going, don't laugh.  Yeah, there's some evilness coming out of Jimmy right now.  I love it.  No, but come on.  What's up with the MS?  He has it.  He's in a wheelchair.  And he, I just took a video of him.  He shits himself, like, all the time now.  It turns out to be M&M's.  Oh, it was M&M's?  Man, if you want to think that, like, life doesn't always work out, watch yourself, watch 
[01:18:00]  your dad shit himself at LaGuardia.  Oh, no.  Why are you taking videos of him?  Well, it's not of him shitting himself.  It's he's peeing himself.  So what do you do when that happens?  You just, like.  Oh, it's awful.  It's like, you know, I have to, like, clean him up.  I have to clean it up.  But you know what?  No, but it's so dark that it's funny.  I'm serious.  Like, it's not, it's not even sad.  My family is so fucked up.  We just laugh.  How do you get that detail?  Do you clean him like a newborn?  Just lucked out. 
[01:18:30]  Yeah.  How do you clean him at LaGuardia?  Lift his legs over his head and wipe.  Actually, that time, that was the first time I ever saw, and he took care of that one himself.  But he was like, no, you could still walk people to the gate.  He's like, no, I want to walk you to the gate.  And, like, people are kind of just like, what is that smell?  And I'm like, thanks, Dad.  You're the best.  Oh, no.  But the first time ever was my sister and I were, we all went to an amusement park.  And, like, we kept doing the same roller coaster.  And we came down in time.  My dad wasn't there.  And then finally, like, an hour later, he came back, and he wasn't wearing pants.  He was just wearing a long shirt.  And we were like, what's going on? 
[01:19:00]  And then he, like, told me.  And I was like, oh.  And he had a convertible.  And I always made my sister sit in the back so that her face was in the wind.  And I was like, hey, you know what?  You know what, sweetheart?  You get shotgun tonight.  Today you get shotgun.  So she's in the front just looking sad.  And I'm in the back, like, free fall.  But wait.  Why don't you just wear something?  You can wear stuff that's where you don't have to, you know, diapers or fucking whatever it is.  MS is, you know.  That's evil.  Yeah, it's fucking awful.  Yeah, well.  That's an evil one, man.  Yeah, it's really brutal. 
[01:19:30]  It sucks.  That's why I do a lot of charity work.  Just kidding.  But I'm going to start.  And he's right now.  Guys, if you look at my license, you'll see that I'm an organ donor.  God's angels show up in weird places.  Yeah, but no.  He, you know, sometimes it comes out in a liquid form, Jim.  All right.  Yeah, but won't that dump?  They still sell stuff for that, right?  What?  Diapers?  Diapers?  Yeah.  This is how hot is this conversation?  What?  This has gotten super, super sexy.  It really is hot.  Actually, these, like, hot Brazilians just moved in down from my mom. 
[01:20:00]  Like, these hot male models.  And I, like, wanted to talk to them.  So I went over and I was like, hey, do you guys have toilet paper?  And then I was like, wait, that is horrible.  And then they're like, how much?  And I'm like, a roll.  A whole roll.  And I was like, wow.  Let me just kill this opportunity.  Well, we want to get to know Amy.  And, well, you're on the road with Kenny and Jimmy.  So Kenny wrote down everything he's learned about you on the road.  Oh, great.  Great.  May I?  Please.  And don't stop me, okay?  I won't stop you.  There's five points I need to make, and then you can comment.  Amy likes to have sex with the lights off. 
[01:20:30]  Amy once banged a homeless guy.  Amy had an abortion.  Amy has STD.  And Amy is a Jew.  Okay.  How many of those are correct?  Two.  Two?  Yeah.  Two are correct.  Two are correct.  Well, the Jew thing, obviously.  I'll say...  Jew and what?  I'll say she has sex in the dark.  Wrong.  Wrong.  Oh, that means this bed was left.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, because I was just thinking, like, the other ones.  Do you have sex with a homeless person? 
[01:21:00]  No.  Okay.  Not on purpose.  Kenny just takes things out of your act and tortures you with them.  That's what he does.  It's obviously an abortion.  No.  No abortion.  I think there must be something wrong with me that I've never been pregnant.  You had an STD?  Really?  Wow.  Yeah, I have HPV.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, wow.  Everybody has that.  If you guys don't have that, I would bet my family's lives that you guys have HPV.  Do you think I have it?  Yes.  I think you created it.  It doesn't show up.  It just means that I'm more at risk for cancer, for cervical cancer. 
[01:21:30]  Nah, what does that do?  And that's the only cancer you could spread or something like that.  Really?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  To guys or something, right?  Well, do you have a cervix?  No, but technically that's a cancer you could spread.  No, it's like you could give...  Give HPV to other people and then give them the opportunity, that great opportunity to  get the cancer.  So technically you're spreading your cancer to somebody else.  Honestly, 94% of the population have HPV.  Wow.  All right.  But I'm proud of it.  I rock that shit. 
[01:22:00]  People are like, who brought the HPV?  I'm like, this girl.  What?  HIV.  Somebody wants to know...  Well, you know what?  Stacey should ask you, maybe.  I just saw a shirt running around the reservoir of this guy.  It said, run for HIV.  I was like, don't you mean from?  I think your shirt needs to be edited.  Stacey has a question for Amy Schumer.  Stacey.  No, it's Stacey.  Yes.  How are you, Amy?  Great.  Does your father have a big package?  Thanks for asking. 
[01:22:30]  Yeah.  Do you want him to shove it in your face like you begged for it?  Yeah.  Good talk.  Did you have to lift his balls to clean them?  I didn't deal with his junk at all.  Oh, okay.  Balls or...  Brewer told a story about that.  Who's the screener, by the way?  Yeah, the person was calling from Yellowstone and the name was Stacey.  Is someone just walking around the OTB with a mic right now?  What, Jimmy?  Brewer told a story about that.  About changing his dad.  He's really old.  Yeah, we all have older parents, Amy, so we know what you're going through.  I can't comprehend it. 
[01:23:00]  There's a few people in my family that had to, you know, clean up a little bit.  Yeah.  Some issues.  Really lets you know you haven't gotten anywhere.  I'm so awful, I just wouldn't handle it well.  No?  No, there's got to be people for that.  You've got to pretend like it's a dog.  Like a big dog.  Put it to sleep?  Fuck it when no one's looking.  My dad would say, why are you putting oven mitts on me?  Putting peanut butter on your genitals.  You wouldn't wipe your mom's hiney, Jimmy? 
[01:23:30]  Come on.  You've got to wipe her.  No, I'd fucking hose her off like in the whole fiction.  That's really nice.  I'd throw her in the yard.  You'd be the cleaner.  You're a shirt, motherfucker.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I guess you do.  You've got to.  If nobody else is going to, you've got to do that.  You have to, right?  Yeah.  I'm hoping to make enough money at Hotel Fredonia where I can hire someone to clean  my dad's shut.  Yeah.  At least for a week.  Yeah.  People really should go see you if they're in that town I've never heard of.  Yeah.  Is it a good gig?  I mean...  I hope it's real.  I think it's going to be like a Hills Have Eyes situation. 
[01:24:00]  Oh, my God.  I get out there, it's just people trying to eat each other.  It's one guy just jerking off in a seat wanting you to do your acting.  I'm like, I'm still getting paid, right?  Wow, that was depressing.  I didn't mean to bring up such a depressing point.  What?  I always do that, though.  I don't mean to.  Well, you like truth.  You like what really happens.  Well, I'm curious.  Yeah.  Some people don't know about it, so why not?  It's weird.  You know somebody or you hang out with somebody and you just...  The dad with the MS?  Whatever.  I think I knew that. 
[01:24:30]  You had said that before.  Yeah.  But it's like, you know, like the furniture business.  I didn't...  Yeah, I lost my dad in a car accident six years ago today.  Today?  Mm-hmm.  I knew that.  That's why I'm a little quiet.  Really?  Mm-hmm.  Wow.  That's right.  But what else is going on?  No, but it's like some shit's so sad, you just can't even...  No.  You know, it's just too sad.  You can't even...  You have to laugh about it.  Me and I were talking during the break.  It's all right.  It becomes something else.  Yeah.  Whatever.  You want to trade?  But I want to trade. 
[01:25:00]  He was heading towards some bad years.  Oh, really?  So in a way, you wonder, you know what I mean?  Yeah.  Yeah, you know.  He was heading towards a bad place.  Well, here's something that I just experienced for the first time.  I made out, in air quotes, with a French guy.  Ooh.  And I didn't know, what's it called when you leave the skin there?  Gross.  Oh.  For skin.  Uncircumcised.  I was like, what is that?  Are we having a pillow fight?  What is that?  But you made out. 
[01:25:30]  Once I got down to it, I was like, I put my hand...  I was like, is there an ice cream cone melting?  What happens?  What the fuck?  Is this a garden, though?  I was so unprepared.  I was like, why is there a condom under the condom?  I was like, what is this?  I got out.  I got out of there.  You really did?  Couldn't even deal with that fucking thing.  Mission aborted.  You just jerked him off a little and left?  No, I didn't even...  I checked it.  I couldn't.  I was so thrown off.  I had no idea.  I wasn't ready for that.  And since then, I've talked about it on stage a little bit. 
[01:26:00]  Did it look like that?  Oh.  Oh, God.  Snuffleupagus.  I love it.  It's that.  Just get that fixed if you have that.  I don't know.  I was so thrown off.  It didn't go any further than that.  How was the kissing and stuff?  Was it good?  I didn't like him.  I didn't want to kiss him.  I was hoping that we could just have some sex.  Without the intimacy of kissing.  Yeah, and as a girl, that's an option.  You can be like, hey, do your job.  How old were they?  Jesus, Danny.  He was 26, which is the youngest I've ever... 
[01:26:30]  But I found out, and I was with my friend.  And he was like, I'm 26.  I was like, well, too late.  You know?  So he was unclipped.  And did he have a big hog or no?  I don't know.  You just grabbed it, and you're like...  I was so buried by cast members of Schindler's List that I had to just get out of there.  Oh, wow.  I ran down the stairs, like, laughing to myself.  Wait, how did you stop it, though?  Because you're, you know...  I went, I'm sad all of a sudden.  I'm sad. 
[01:27:00]  That's a great one.  And the worst is my shirt was, like, complicated.  It was, like, a kind of, like, strange tank top where you...  And I'm, like, trying to put it on the dark.  I'm like, sorry, I'm just, like, so upset.  And he's like, no, you're not.  I was like, miss you.  I was like, don't be mad.  I'm sad.  I'm sad.  I literally said, I'm sad.  Had you just met him or no?  No, I've known him for a while.  Okay, but you didn't know he was unclipped?  No.  And that was your first time fooling around him?  Yeah.  Wow.  Unbelievable.  Oh, that's fucking how horrible.  I ran for the hills. 
[01:27:30]  See, you should learn.  Can you stop?  You're showing me these.  Well, we just wanted to know what he just keeps popping unclipped cock up on the monitor.  Guys get offended.  Like, some guys have been, like, that are uncircumcised have been, like, I've never got any complaints.  I'm like, not to your face.  Yeah, not to your face.  Only on radio shows.  You can't hear it with those flaps in the wind.  God.  What if we had a little extra something down there?  Yeah, I would love it.  No, no.  Imagine going down a girl's pants and then you feel just this massive skin. 
[01:28:00]  An extra skin.  You'd be like, I would go, I feel sad.  Yeah, I feel sad.  I feel sad.  Jimmy likes you looking sloppy.  I like a mess.  You have to realize that what we're comparing this to is, like, if you had women that get  their pussy lips snipped, like, that have big pussies and get them snipped, that to  me is what...  You want, like, an open face.  Amy, does yours look like that?  What is all of that?  I love that.  An explosion at the Steakums factory.  That's not even that great, though.  Is it just dangling?  I like fucking meat.  Big fat lips.  No meat.  Wow.  Big fat lips. 
[01:28:30]  No, I'm not rocking that.  Amy, can you show us what yours looks like?  Sure.  Just point to the picture on the screen.  Oh, I went like this.  Putting her hands together.  Oh, there it is.  There it is.  That's you.  That's balls.  That's a ball sack.  Yes, gross.  With no balls inside.  Total scrotum.  I am starving.  Loose meat sandwiches.  Yeah, find a fucking...  Pussy portrait.  Linda Might has a good clip.  Linda Might has a good clip.  She's a little older.  Yeah.  But Linda Might has a good old pussy.  If she was younger, she'd be great.  That is fucked up. 
[01:29:00]  What is that?  Which one?  That's not even right.  This one.  That's the grossest thing I've ever seen.  Which one?  That's not right.  Quick click on it.  Oh, God.  Let me see.  What do you do?  That's when you start to feel sad.  Oh, that's terrible.  That's just not okay.  You ever see...  That's warts.  You ever see the blue waffle?  No.  You ever see the blue waffle?  This is like one of the worst mornings of my life.  I don't watch this.  Danny, can you show her the blue waffle?  I know it's old school.  Her pussy's good.  Let's pull up the blue.  Oh, God.  That's disgusting.  It's not.  Black girl's a giant pussy.  No, that looks like a...  Damn.  That's rough. 
[01:29:30]  That's fucking fantastic.  Looks like Al Jolson singing.  Mammy, how I love ya.  How I love ya.  Oh, no.  No.  Oh, God.  Nice, right, Danny?  There you go.  Nice, right?  It's like a little ass.  I like it like that.  A tiny little ass.  Tiny, tiny.  I like it bigger than that.  Fucking amazing.  This girl named Rhonda, who was on the show once years ago, like in 2002, had the kind  of vagina I like.  What are we talking?  She had a little...  He just started licking his lip.  She had a little penis.  Yeah, she had a big clit. 
[01:30:00]  That was the one, remember?  It was a tiny penis.  What is that?  That's the blue waffle.  I can't look at that.  That is a reason not to go in the ocean.  What is that?  I can't look at it.  Oh, I can't look at it.  It's like a sea urchin.  It is a sea urchin.  It's like the rarest sushi.  Will you look at it?  I looked at it.  I cannot look at it again.  It looks like when you open an abalone shell.  Oh, my God.  Oh, that other picture right there is...  Take that...  Oh, my God.  Look at that one.  Is that different?  Where, where, where?  Yeah.  Oh.  Right there.  Oh, my God.  That is so gross.  Why is it blue? 
[01:30:30]  Why is it crying?  It's, it's the blue waffle.  It's blowing its nose.  Want some waffles?  Oh.  That's a horrible...  Why do they name it the blue waffle?  I get the blue part of blue waffle, but not the waffle part.  Oh, it just sounds right.  It's nauseous.  I'm nauseous.  Hey, Chris in Houston wants to warn you about where you're going for your gig.  Oh, okay.  At Hotel Fredonia.  Yeah.  Hotel Fredonia.com.  Everyone's got a warning.  And that would be Friday, this Friday.  Yeah.  Yes, Chris.  I'm not really sure about the Hotel Fredonia, but Nacogdoches is a small shithole. 
[01:31:00]  Just north of Houston.  Just fucking fire your agent, tell, or manager, whatever.  Tell him to take you to Houston.  Oh, well, you know, I'm not...  I think he should be in Houston.  Maybe she's getting good money for a one-nighter.  I would do it.  All right.  Good point.  One-nighter.  I don't know.  I mean, I don't know.  All right.  And this guy also has info about where you're going.  Chris from Louisiana.  Chris.  Yeah.  From Louisiana, too.  Come on.  Say the same thing he was saying.  This place is out in the middle of nowhere.  There's a...  It'll be like every other weekend for me. 
[01:31:30]  But the damn town is only about 15,000 people max.  All right.  If they all come to the show.  I can do some damage.  Yeah.  If everybody brings a friend, I'll make a grand.  Why there, though?  I'm sorry, sir.  What?  Unfortunately, it's a dry county.  You've got to drive about 20 miles to buy any liquor.  Okay.  These are the kind of warnings that are important.  Now you need to know to bring some to the Fredonia Hotel there.  Yes.  Yeah.  Okay.  From the airport.  That's the worst if you get somewhere and then you find out. 
[01:32:00]  You can't.  Or an Indian reservation casino.  And they're like, oh, no, we don't have any.  You're like, well, why would people come here?  What's that?  I thought you guys were famous for drinking.  Yeah.  What kind of drunk are you?  Drinking in rain.  You're fine?  Yeah, I'm fine.  Raving.  I'm a fun drunk.  Raving.  I'm not a crying drunk.  I'm like a drunk.  Yeah.  No.  I'll be okay in a minute.  The only tears would be like me and a friend being like, I love you so much.  You're the best.  Look how awesome we are.  Yeah.  No, I tested positive for being a fun drunk. 
[01:32:30]  Yeah, that's good.  Kenny has added more facts about Amy Schumer.  Oh, here we go.  And I think these are the real ones.  Tell Kenny, be careful.  He's going to get some facts.  Okay.  Ooh.  Amy Schumer eats really slow.  Oh, my God.  Fucking, she's the worst.  I forgot.  They eat fast, they eat like it's their last meal, like it's a trough.  We eat normal people's feed.  I do.  And it's fucking, it's...  I'm cutting, I'm cutting my knee.  I eat like a little old woman.  Get Kenny in here.  What do you mean?  Oh, does she fucking nibble? 
[01:33:00]  I do.  You guys go to Morton's.  You guys like Morton's on the road.  Yeah.  And it takes her forever together.  Yeah, we have steak.  She has a lima bean.  We finish at the same time.  Kenny, what's up with Amy?  Oh, hey, Kenny.  Eating really slow.  You look like a game show host today.  That's right, Amy.  Can you take a picture of him, please?  Oh, my God.  What a creepy game show.  No, she probably, like, takes care of herself.  She tries to be healthy.  Hey, we have worked out together.  I've seen Kenny at the gym.  Ridiculous, right?  She is, too, though. 
[01:33:30]  She's fucking...  Well, that...  Yeah, but all the working out I'm trying to do, Amy's the shape I'm trying to get into.  You want some breasts and a labia, Kenny?  All right.  Do you spin, Amy?  What do you do for...  I do do yoga and Pilates.  Yoga?  Does yoga help with weight loss?  Pilates.  I don't know.  Like, probably.  If you do it right.  It's good.  I'm not going to therapy, so it's just, like, good to go to yoga.  All right.  And finally...  The Pilates thing is crazy, though, right?  Pilates is good. 
[01:34:00]  That's the best.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Helps, right?  Yeah.  Because you use weights, right?  It's, like, just these weird machines.  The guy, Joseph Pilates, came up with it during World War II.  He used it, like, for injured soldiers.  And these guys were in their hospital beds.  They got jacked.  Really?  You know?  Yeah.  They got in the best shape of their lives from there.  I never knew that.  Yes, well...  A little trivia.  Okay, so...  What are the facts?  Oh, there's one more.  And someone else saying that you're playing in a cool college town.  Nagadocious?  I guess.  Yeah, probably.  But it's, like, the Bible Belt, too. 
[01:34:30]  Nobody's expecting this Friday night to be fun for me.  Yeah.  What are you flying into?  Are you flying into Houston?  And then what?  Oh, so you get to see Houston.  Yeah, I will get to be there for about ten minutes.  That's nice.  Because they drive you away from the city.  Yeah, then...  See the city go by in the rearview mirror there.  Yeah, then they'll take me.  All right.  Amy once had a bicycle stolen.  Oh, yeah.  My bike was once stolen.  And also the bike seat, which was way more embarrassing. 
[01:35:00]  To walk at home, no bike seat.  Be like, oh, shorty, what happened?  Everyone's yelling at me.  Everyone's trashing me.  I'm like, maybe I just don't want a seat.  They're like, you got robbed.  I'm like, yes, I did.  Yes, I did.  They just took your seat?  They just took the seat.  It was embarrassing.  Some guy smelling it?  It's okay.  I'll ride it home for you.  Yeah.  Where are the railroad tracks?  See you later. 
[01:35:30]  All right.  Should we take a break?  Yeah, I'll break.  More with Amy Schumer?  Yeah.  What do you want to promote besides the gig?  Twitter?  Yeah, Twitter.  Just get more people on Twitter.  And I'll be at Rooster Tees in San Jose.  It's a club.  The 26th, 27th, 28th.  Okay, so you're doing, the 13th, you're going to Texas and you're coming back and going back  to Texas?  San Jose.  Oh.  California.  I'm sorry.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm tired.  Yeah.  You're like, so. 
[01:36:00]  San Jose, Texas.  You're like, what does your dad have?  So wait, your mom pissed herself at what that's happening?  Yeah.  Well, I didn't know about you.  I feel bad now that we brought that up.  I brought it up.  That's true.  I said we as the collective.  Thank you.  I think she brought it up.  Yeah, she did.  Yeah.  Yeah, you could have lied.  Nope.  Nope.  Stupid life.  Goddamn life.  Time, actually.  We fucking hate time.  Time's a bitch.  What else is a bitch? 
[01:36:30]  I mean, not to kill that subject, but BP stock is down.  Yeah.  Well, it'll go back up.  Speaking of things spilling.  I know.  Speaking of cleanup.  It'll go back up.  Took your joke.

[01:41:30]  But have you guys, you've been to Wildwood?  I have been, actually, yes.  Many.  Lately?  Last August, yeah.  Wildwood, meaning New Jersey Shore.  The only way to blend in there is to tattoo, I hate whitey all over you.  Yeah.  And, uh...  Oh.  Oh, dude, let me tell you something.  I went...  My daughter...  North Wildwood with the boardwalk?  Yeah.  My daughter has a gymnastics convention, right?  So, we're trying to get... 
[01:42:00]  Hotels are all sold out.  And everyone tells you, eh, well, the hotels there aren't so nice anyway.  All right, no problem.  Go down there.  I find a condo.  Which is a half a block from the boardwalk, three blocks from the convention center.  Nice.  And this is going to be...  Perfect.  Nice.  We show up.  There's a lot of, uh, different groups walking.  We got to about midnight on a Friday night.  Very diverse crowd. 
[01:42:30]  Thank you, Anthony.  Wait, what weekend was it, by the way?  Uh, Memorial Day.  Oh.  Not in Wildwood.  And that's what everyone says.  No.  No.  Oh, gang weekend in Wildwood.  Oh, shit.  Yeah, that's where the gangs go there.  Are you kidding me?  No, I'm very...  That's been talking about for years.  It's known as gang weekend?  Gang weekend?  What's a gang weekend?  I believe it.  Check that out.  With your young family.  Oh, my God.  Now I realize how much danger I was and how stupid I was all weekend.  Oh, my...  All right.  Check this out.  Is it really known as gang weekend?  I believe it is, yeah. 
[01:43:00]  I think...  Well...  Because I've been down there.  That's why I was surprised by what you're saying.  It ends with cops.  There's some diversity, but...  It ends with cops and them explaining this to me.  However, that's interesting you say that, because I thought the cop was just doing a cop-up.  So, Friday night, we get there, diversity crowd, blah, blah, blah.  Beautiful condo.  We get in a condo.  I'm always sweating out, because anywhere I gotta go, the wife has to walk in, look around,  and go, oh, yes, we're staying, or no, we're not, find a new place now.  She has to approve of it.  She's done that before? 
[01:43:30]  Oh, of course.  Yes.  Absolutely.  There's nothing more fun than being delayed on a plane, taking care of the kids and having  a breakdown.  You walk into a beautiful suite and you go, I smell smoke.  Someone in here has smoked before, or there's stains, or like, we're leaving.  It's a five-star suite.  Are you kidding me?  Where we going?  I want to be put up.  All right, all right, all right.  So, with that, thank God, instant relief, I get in the condo, we're okay. 
[01:44:00]  Now, I don't have a problem with diversity.  None whatsoever.  However, the next day, I notice the group directly across the street from me, there's  about 30 of them, and they're having a great time.  They're singing gospel, not gospel, they're singing, you know, they're just singing.  R&B or something?  Thank you, Anthony. 
[01:44:30]  Yeah, okay.  A lot of R&B, a lot of this, a lot of Latino music, it's all good.  However, around four o'clock, I hear screaming, yelling, look out in the street, there's about  30 of them in the street, right outside my condo.  Yo, fuck, I'll kill you, motherfucker, I'll kill you, y'all, I want a piece of this, you  man up, man up.  I'm like, man up, okay, all right, you know, cops come, cockroaches, back in the buildings. 
[01:45:00]  Don't get too much, we survived, the first night, very loud, I can't stand white people.  Hate them, let's round them up and kill them.  Hate white people, especially ones that just got here.  All is good.  All is good.  I go on the boardwalk, I notice, all right, it's a little, I'm a little too upper middle 
[01:45:30]  classed out, so let me scale down a little, back to my roots, I'll put on my T's, my ACDC  shirt, little shorts, I got no problem with this, no problem with the diversity, I got no  tattoos, I have no tattoos, I stick out big time.  Yeah.  Big time, no tattoos, you stick out.  All right, I'm walking around, Sunday night, we're leaving Monday, Sunday night, about seven 
[01:46:00]  o'clock, you know, class breaking, fuck, kill you, motherfucker, look out, full blown brawl.  Oh, shit.  In the middle of the street, there's three piles of people getting kicked, punched, I'm trying  the kid, the kid's like, what's going on?  There's nothing.  Don't look at this.  Look, who wants to play Candyland?  Have some Coke and Pepsi and killing each other.  Call the cops, there's a brawl outside, I see knives. 
[01:46:30]  Cops come, they put, whee!  As soon as they hear the sirens, of course, the cockroaches go back in their, in their  bed.  Which is why they put on the sirens before they get there.  Absolutely.  Yeah, so they don't have to deal with that shit.  Absolutely.  Now it's about nine o'clock, ten o'clock, kids go to bed, car pulls up outside.  You know, now that I think about this, it's really, I'm really stupid for doing this, but  my wife, hilarious, she's like, ooh, someone's having a barbecue. 
[01:47:00]  I went, hon, that's not barbecue, that's pot.  And a pot, and a pot is just streaming in our, in our condo, and I look out, and they're  all outside, you know, with the big cigar, I hate white people.  Car pulls up, blasting, shaking whole ass, like a dope, I don't even think, like, you  know, that's, I get, they're turning that down.  So I go, oh, no, this is how people die, what's wrong with you, this is how people die. 
[01:47:30]  I go outside, I go walking up, and they're all right in the middle of smoking a pot and  all that, and I said, listen, listen, oh, listen, the, listen, my kids are right there.  The one guy's looking at me, goes, I'm parking.  I said, I understand you're parking, but you don't need the music that loud. 
[01:48:00]  I said, I got kids, I just, you go down the street and play that, I got no problem with  that, if you go down the street and play it.  The one Latino kid, he's, he's had no shirt on since we got there, and he's the main culprit  for starting all the fights.  He goes, no, no, I feel him, I feel him.  I, it's all right, I feel him, he reaches in, turns it down.  I said, all right, we got a connection, we're okay.  He feels me, I'm cool, I wasn't a dick.  I just came out, like, listen, man, he turned it down.  I go back up, three minutes later, ping, ping, look out, full-blown street brawl. 
[01:48:30]  Again, the kid with no shirt, has a guy in the street, and he's smashing his head on  the ground, and the other guy's kicking his legs, and then as I look up, there's the  chicks are now fighting.  All these Latino chicks, pulling hair, screaming, fighting.  There's a whole group of black kids coming out, and it's, I'm like, this is the sickest  thing I've ever seen in my life. 
[01:49:00]  This is stuff you see on, like, police videos, and you go, this would never happen in the  northeast of America.  This is obviously, again, I call the cops.  I'm like, guys, the fights, they're killing each other.  Meanwhile, this must go on, because every white person in the neighborhood, and there's  only, like, six of us, they all hang out on their patios in the pitch dark, just watching.  Yeah.  Like, behind towels, you know, they put the towels over the railings, and it just... 
[01:49:30]  They're peeking through.  Yeah, and they're all just watching, you know, and...  Again, cops, turn on...  Scatter like cockroaches.  Midnight, same thing.  Fight, killing each other, blah, blah, blah.  Holy shit.  They're beating each other against my condo, and I hear, like, pfft, pfft, pfft, I call  the cops, I say, don't turn on the sirens.  They're trying to break in the condo.  That gets them to come.  They come, that's how stupid the cops are, or how much they don't care in Wildwood. 
[01:50:00]  The cops come, and they pull up to the house.  I give them the address and everything.  This is where they are, they keep going up there, and three times, and the animal with  no shirt is in there.  Cop gets out, they all come out, and they start talking to the cops, you know, and we're watching,  like, oh, they're gonna get it now, those little gangbangers are gonna get it.  They start pointing down the street, all the cops get in their cars, and they head up the  street.  Oh, they told him, yeah, they went that away.  They told him to bury them.  They went that away. 
[01:50:30]  You can't even make that up.  So they all take off, except for one.  The one guy's parked below me, and my wife's like, don't say no.  I said, no, I'm gonna tell these guys.  My brothers are cops.  I'm gonna tell them.  They're all in that house.  I go, hey, shh, hey, pshh.  He looks up at me.  I said, listen, they're all in that, they're all in there right now.  He goes, no, it's another house up the street.  I said, no.  I've been here for two nights.  It's that house.  They get in fights. 
[01:51:00]  They wait for people to walk by.  They start the fights with them, and the main guy, he's looking at me right now.  He's got no shirt on.  He's up on the top, and he's right there.  The guy saw you pointing at him?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, holy shit.  Jesus.  Are they black or white?  I said, everything.  Black, white, Latino, mostly Latino.  He goes, okay.  He gets in his car, and he leaves.  I swear to God.  All right, you know what?  Let me just get out of this place.  Let me get out of this place. 
[01:51:30]  We're done.  It's Monday morning.  It's Memorial Day, so we're leaving.  Life is good.  No worries.  I'm packing up the house.  They're all outside.  We're hanging out.  No big deal.  I have my car in the front.  I packed it.  I have my in-laws, who, to give you a little bit of my in-laws, I mean, they are as white  as you can be, and they've never seen any type of crime whatsoever, except for on cops. 
[01:52:00]  Matter of fact, there's a joke in our house called, Where's the Gun, Jin?  Because they live almost near Pennsylvania, and one night, someone was banging on their  door at three in the morning, and my father-in-law is going, you know, who is it?  And they couldn't understand.  We're calling the cops.  Open the door.  And he said, Get the gun, Jin, knowing he has no gun, but as a last resort. 
[01:52:30]  And my mother-in-law goes, What gun, Herb?  We don't have guns.  So there's a hole.  She blew it.  Yeah.  So in the family, there's a running joke of, Go get the gun, Jin, whatever you space it.  Yeah, who was at the door?  Who was at the door in the end?  They were movers.  Okay.  And the cops came 40 minutes later.  They were movers.  They were told, This is the address. 
[01:53:00]  Oh, for wrong house.  And the people are really old, and they won't hear them, and they're incoherent, and all  that.  And it was like two houses wrong.  So anyway.  What gun?  We don't have a gun.  We don't have a gun.  What gun?  So the same in-laws are with you down in Wildwood.  They're with me.  Right.  Backing up the car.  Now, my condo, you've got to enter it from the second floor.  So the first floor has a door.  You go into a garage area, and you walk up a spiral staircase, and then you're on your 
[01:53:30]  patio, and you're walking your front door.  So technically, you feel safe, because your front door is up a level.  You've got the high ground.  Yeah.  Yes.  But you do have to walk up the stairs.  Anyone can walk up the stairs, technically.  Well, with that, I got everyone in the car, except for my one daughter.  The oldest one's got her iPod, like, I'm leaving the world.  I'm sitting on the sick floor.  Two daddies ready.  Two daddies says we're leaving?  I'm not getting in the car.  All right.  Now, the mother-in-law comes up to me and goes, Can you believe this man is giving these 
[01:54:00]  girls drugs right in front of us?  And she's saying it way too loud.  Oh, no.  I said, I don't know what you're talking about.  She's like, Look, right in front of our door.  So I turn around.  The worst of worst.  Not to be biased, but any time I see an albino, it's almost like a pit bull.  You never know.  Is it human?  Is it not human?  Is it black?  Is it white?  It's an albino.  It's an albino.  That's all I have to say. 
[01:54:30]  It's an albino.  And the albino is hanging out with these three little Latino girls.  And he's, you know, whatever.  He still cares what he's doing.  He don't care if he's doing, I don't care either.  So with that, she goes, He's dealing drugs.  I said, Ginny, just get in the car.  We're leaving in three seconds.  All I got to do is take this key, go up to the condo, put it in the box, shut the door.  We're in the car.  We're done with Wildwood.  They're blocking the pathway to the door. 
[01:55:00]  Oh, shit.  So I just said, excuse me, albino is fine.  He gives me the, you know, no problem thing.  As I'm walking up the staircase, I run into a Latino chick.  And it just startled me because I don't know where she came from.  I wasn't looking.  And she's like in front of my condo on the second floor.  And I went, I'm sorry.  Can I help you?  And she goes, I'm sitting. 
[01:55:30]  I'm sitting.  And I was confused.  I didn't because there's one level up higher than me.  And I know they weren't there.  So I thought maybe she came.  I just was startled.  She came out of nowhere.  And she goes, what?  You can't sit?  I'm just asking a question, hon.  That's all.  I'm just asking a question.  I didn't see where you came from.  Just like that.  And as she's walking away, I'm staring at her like, where'd this chick come from?  Albino says, get in your house before I kill you, motherfucker. 
[01:56:00]  Yo, I'm just, I'm not talking to you.  I'm just asking a question.  Get in your house before I slap you like a bitch.  My blood fuel.  You've had it at this point.  But you're seconds away from your padding.  Seconds.  You finally snapped.  You're that close.  I'm seconds.  And these are moments that can define the rest of your life. 
[01:56:30]  Is your whole family in the car?  They're in the car.  Even your daughter.  My daughter's waiting for me.  She's oblivious because she has headphones on.  So she has no clue what's going on.  So I look to my daughter to see if she's listening and watching this.  She's oblivious.  So I look back to him and goes, what are you looking at?  And I stare at and I'm staring at him.  And then I just went, okay, okay, I'm going to go in the house.  I'm going to drop the key. 
[01:57:00]  I'm going to call the cops on him.  Call the cops.  And when the cops come, I'm going to be a dick.  And I'm going to say he was dealing drugs in front of here and to frisk him.  And he just threatened my life.  So this is where we're going to handle this.  How many times at this point have you called the cops?  Four.  This is the fourth time.  This is the fourth time in a weekend.  In a weekend.  Within a period of 18 hours.  So I call the cops.  Because he's waiting.  Now everyone in the car is texting me. 
[01:57:30]  And they're being, meh.  They have no clue what's going on.  So I'm trying to text go and just chill out.  No one knows what's going on.  Catastrophe.  But I don't want to walk by him.  Because if he threatens me now with my kid, now I've got to do something.  And I also know it's not going to become a battle between me and albino.  It's going to be me and the Bloods and the Crips.  Yeah, yeah.  Against.  You're done.  And we are wildebeest.  Yeah, you're done.  We're wildebeest.  The lions and the hyenas. 
[01:58:00]  They're not even going to think what's going on.  It's just going to be a beat down.  I don't need my kids to watch that.  These are the moments where I go, I'm glad I don't have a gun.  And it's really good not to have a gun law for people like me.  Because I would not have.  I would have went, I dare him.  And I'm going to take him down in cold blood right in front.  I'm just going to.  I have dreams of just me walking by him with my daughter.  And be like, what did you say?  I don't know. 
[01:58:30]  I was like, pow!  And while he's on the ground, the girls are going in horror.  I just want to.  And just watch it and it ooze out as I watch and just.  Yeah, that might be a problem.  And then they all start running and I just start pouring.  I go, who's next?  Who's next?  You want to see what's in the back pocket?  Like everyone, get the car.  I just.  The scenarios go through your head.  And they go.  And then you think of the guy on the subway with the glasses.  And he says, I am Bernard Katz of the millennium. 
[01:59:00]  And I will get away.  And so cops come.  And I tell him, my life's been threatened.  This guy threatened my life.  My daughter's here.  You better get here quick.  I swear to God, this is the moment in life where I never hated an officer or the officers  of law in my entire life to this moment.  Because half my family is our officers.  But this guy's a first class douchebag. 
[01:59:30]  And for reasons of, I would never disrespect, I won't say his name, but he works in the  Wildwood Police Department.  Fuck him.  He pulls up.  I finally come out.  I come out of the apartment.  And he goes, what's going on?  I said, excuse me, sir.  This guy's dealing drugs in front of here, which I don't have a problem with.  But as I walked by him, 11 years old, he threatened to kill me and slap me.  And he's going to punch me and kill me and all that jazz.  And he goes, all right, I heard your case. 
[02:00:00]  Go stand over there.  Oh, shit.  So I said, no, no, no.  Hold on a second.  He goes, I heard your case.  Stand over there.  I got your story.  So he turns to the albino.  And all he's doing is my wife gets out of the car.  And she's like, what is going on?  Finally realizing something is amiss.  She's like, what's going on?  Ma'am, get back in the car.  Why are you yelling at my husband?  Ma'am, get in the car now.  I'm going to pull the two of you aside. 
[02:00:30]  And we're going to have a problem with the two of you.  Now I want to forget the albino.  I want to kill the cop.  I want to kill him.  I want to beat him down like a little bitch that he is.  So he turns into the albino.  And of course, the albino goes, I do nothing.  He goes upstairs.  He disrespects, girl.  And, you know, oof, oof.  So the cop goes, well, you know, it's a private property and you can't be hanging out on the 
[02:01:00]  staircase.  And, you know, all right, sir, come over here.  I come over there like a like a like a rotten child.  I feel like a little snitchy child.  I come over and he goes, here's your situation.  You can which I suggest you take an apology from this man or you come downtown and fill  out papers for a couple hours.  I went, all right, I'll take his apology.  Sure, I'll take his apology.  Only if he looks me in the eye, though. 
[02:01:30]  So the guy's like, well, you know, I said, you know, so you're not going to do it.  You know, you're going to pat him down or nothing.  Like I told you, he's like, sir, I just told you what your situation is.  Are you going to take the apology or are you going to go downtown and fill out the papers?  So now I'm like, this guy's going to leave me to get murdered.  This fucking cop is going to leave me to get murdered.  I said, I'll take the apology, but he's got to look me in the eye.  Five tries later, the guy finally looks me in the eye, says he's sorry.  I turn to the cop.  I said, listen, you don't leave until my whole family's out of here. 
[02:02:00]  I'm lying.  And then I pulled him.  I said, you know, my brother's a cop.  Oh, your brother's a cop?  Yeah, that's the first thing I said to you when he got out of the car.  And I also told you he was dealing.  Oh, you didn't tell me he was dealing drugs.  I said, the first thing I said to you is this guy's dealing drugs and he threatened my life.  He's like, you did not say that.  And the only reason I say that is because the sergeant now is there.  If you told me that, I would have patted him down.  So now the story goes, I go, well, you know, I'll call my brother and I'll try to figure it. 
[02:02:30]  He goes, listen, where's your brother?  I said, 100, in New York.  Oh, oh, oh, your brother's like, oh, it's New York City?  I said, yeah.  And as that changes anything, he starts having a meltdown.  And he goes, listen, don't let this weekend bother you.  It's the worst goddamn weekend of Wildwood.  He's just losing it?  I swear my kid's life.  He goes, these people are animals.  They're animals. 
[02:03:00]  And what they have done to the city of Wildwood is a disgrace.  There was 300 rapes last night, two murders.  These people are animals.  And the mayor doesn't care.  He goes, we're shorthanded.  We're shorthanded.  So it all came out.  Like, he's just, he's just, uh.  They're just going through the motions.  Living through the weekend.  He's trying to survive himself.  He turns around and he goes, listen, please come back 4th of July.  It's all friendly white families. 
[02:03:30]  I said, yeah.  I'm making my appointment now.  Can't wait to come back to Wildwood, New Jersey.  But did they wait while you left?  They waited till I left.  Oh, that's good.  Fuck that.  So at the end, you, yes, Wildwood.  Now, here's the funny thing.  Because my wife's, uh, I'll say she's half born again now.  She was full born again.  Now she's half born again.  The whole weekend, she's like, I don't know why God put that in our laps. 
[02:04:00]  She's like, I'm a very open mind.  I'm going to pray to God and ask him why he did that.  And it really messed her.  She's like, I don't, I don't know if you should be famous.  Like, why is the devil doing it?  We're good people.  Because they're animals.  We're good people.  Yeah, we are good people.  But you can't be in certain scenarios.  Didn't people recognize you from a half-baked?  That's a big Chappelle vehicle.  They're all the Chappelle.  Unfortunately, if they were, no, which was weird.  The boardwalk, I got more recognition. 
[02:04:30]  But these guys didn't.  I don't know if it's because they were Latino.  The blacks do.  The blacks all love me.  Matter of fact, one time I'm going to Shea Stadium, and I've got some of my wife's friends,  and they're all, church gang, mission group.  So I'm like, all right, well, I'll bring them all to Shea Stadium.  We're going to the Met game.  I said, but I'm drinking.  You know, right now, I'm drinking.  So we're going to the Met game.  Tons of traffic, FDR.  I pull over, and I cut through Harlem. 
[02:05:00]  As I'm going through Harlem, I mean, we're in the deep part of Harlem.  I turn to this guy who's milky white.  Kids are in the back.  My kids are oblivious to anything.  They could be driving through hell, and they're like, well, it's a cool kid.  Can we get out and play?  So the guy looks nervous, and I go, listen, I know this sounds crazy to you,  but if anything ever went down, this is where I would feel probably the safest in my life  is perhaps right here in Harlem amongst these people, because they know me, they trust me,  and I trust them. 
[02:05:30]  He's like, really?  I even finished a sentence, I swear to God, I hear a tap on my window, and I jumped five feet,  and the guy's like, oh, shit, let me cut a picture.  That's a nigga in half bank.  That's a silly nigga in half bank.  Do that shit when you order the food.  You see what I'm talking about?  So, unfortunately, no.  I think if they were black, it would have been safer, and I would have been fine. 
[02:06:00]  But I don't know.  These guys were from a different...  Yeah, that's just...  It made me wonder, man, when...  Like, that guy really did throw me...  There was a part of my life where I became a lot more open-minded,  but that incident with that albino, just my daughter's there, my family's there,  I didn't threaten you, there was no threat, and he just turned around blatantly,  shut the fuck up, I'm gonna slap your bitch, and I'll kill you.  He said, I'm gonna slap your bitch or slap you?  I'm gonna slap you, you bitch, get up in your house. 
[02:06:30]  That...  Could you have taken him?  Oh, easy.  He was a little punk kid.  He was a little punk kid.  So, unless he had a weapon...  You don't know what he's packing.  If he wasn't packing, I tell you right now, I would have killed him,  because the rage I have as a father, I would have...  He's just...  He's going for the big swing in front of...  And he's also in front of his chicks, so he's just trying to impress the chicks.  I'm trying to live for life.  He's trying to win for a score, I'm going to kill.  There's a big difference.  I'm not going down, I'm gonna kill him. 
[02:07:00]  So, yeah, I could have easily...  But, thank God, because I would have killed him.  I would have killed him.  But those...  Here, attention...  And that's why I think segregation works.  And it's not a racial thing.  It's...  Everyone understands each...  And when you mix the groups, whether they enjoy each other or not,  there's some groups that just based on hate.  And this was the opposite hate.  This was opposite hate. 
[02:07:30]  So, as much as blacks and Latinos or whoever would say white people hate,  they proved on that weekend they have just as much hate and disrespect  for someone that's probably more open-minded than they could have ever imagined.  This guy threatened my life in front of my children.  They obviously...  Just trying to get the fuck out of town.  Just trying to leave.  I'm just trying to get out of here.  And they didn't pat him down, obviously, huh?  No!  Jeez.  So, screw Wildhood.  That one cop.  I wish I could...  I wish we had his number.  I'd love to talk to that little fag.

Well, here's Louis C.K. on Father's Day, which obviously was yesterday.  A few days ago, I was leaving a restaurant with my youngest daughter, and I was holding her hand, and I was texting with this hand. 
[02:12:30]  Yeah, I'm that guy.  A woman walked by, and she gave me a dirty look like, hmm, you should pay more attention to your kid.  Okay, guilty.  But I have something to say to that woman.  This is why I'm able to spend time with my kids when I should be at work.  It was noon on a Thursday, okay?  I had a crazy amount of work to do.  But my kid graduated from preschool that day, and I wanted to take her to lunch.  It was a great lunch.  We sat at the same side of the table the way she likes to share a chicken cutlet.  I ate some of her chicken cutlet.  We looked at her drawings. 
[02:13:00]  She told me many stories about the chinchilla in the classroom.  And so now I'm texting, and you walk by, eh, bad father.  What do you know?  Okay, I'm being defensive.  I'm sorry.  I shouldn't have been texting.  You know, when my kids were younger, I used to avoid them.  I used to sit on the toilet until my legs fell asleep.  You want to know why your father spent so long in the toilet?  Because he's not sure he wants to be a father.  I felt like being a dad was taking away everything I wanted to be.  And I was right.  But so what?  What's so great about our lives? 
[02:13:30]  What the hell is an adult without kids?  What's the point?  So I got off the toilet.  I flushed down my personal dreams.  And I decided, I'm going to be a dad.  I'm not going to be mom's assistant.  That's depressing.  Don't do that if you're a dad.  Just wait for her to write you a list.  Walk around the store staring at it.  And call her from the cereal aisle to make sure she got it right.  Be a man.  Make your own list.  Do we need any avocados?  Fathers have skills that they never use at home.  You run a landscaping business and you can't dress and feed a four-year-old. 
[02:14:00]  Take it on.  Spend time with your kids and have your own ideas about what they need.  Get into it.  It won't take away your manhood.  It'll give it to you.  I did that.  I spent more time with my kids.  I took it on.  I found out that I'm a pretty bad father.  I make a lot of mistakes.  I don't know what I'm doing.  But my kids love me.  Go figure.  Yeah, right on, Louie.  That's fucking good, man.  That's a great spot, too.  Fucking Sunday morning.  I saw on the CBS website where they have that posted, the comments. 
[02:14:30]  Uh-huh.  This woman wrote a really just angry, angry...  Why?  A bunch of people got mad.  A bunch of people got offended.  I could see that audience kind of not getting...  Everybody gets offended now about everything.  And there's one line in there that touched off a few people that got really offended because  you just can't say anything negative anymore.  Can you think of what line in there would offend people?  I'm trying to think now because something did hit me when you said it.  And I'm thinking...  I'm trying to think...  It's just me saying, what's the grown-up without kids? 
[02:15:00]  What's the point?  Right, right.  What's the point?  And, uh, well, I happen to not have children and it's because I couldn't.  How dare you?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's just like this woman wrote a long thing saying, excuse me, but I was married to a  man who had a vasectomy and lied and didn't tell me about it.  And it turns out that before he did, he had an illegitimate child and then he left me  for that woman, so that comedian owes me $1,000.  So that's my fucking problem? 
[02:15:30]  Yeah, exactly.  Sorry.  She could still adopt.  Right?  Exactly.  And she really wants to be here.  Yeah, exactly.  Fuck you.  What's wrong with adopting?  Just because it didn't come out of your smelly cunts.  Your dumpster womb.  A lot of people adopt, you miserable old lady.  That cobweb haunted mansion womb of yours.  And it doesn't want to have the kids, so...  No.  And he wasn't offended by that line, right?  No.  It just has no desire.  I just think I'm too selfish with my time and stuff like that.  Yeah, it's the choice you make.  And who cares? 
[02:16:00]  That's the point of view at the moment that I said it.  It's like people think that everything you say has to be very well measured and has to represent everybody's point of view.  And like, how dare you state that a childless person is worthless?  I just fucking said it.  And who gives a shit?  And by the way, yeah, that's like...  That's what I thought at the time, at the moment.  And who cares?  It's like, well, yeah.  And everyone knows Louis is a great father.  Too bad I can't do a Charles Osgood.  Jordan obviously watches Sunday morning.  I would love to hear Charles Osgood say, 
[02:16:30]  Up next, comedian Louis C.K. talks about Father's Day and calls his daughter a cunt.  Oh, God.  And later, death of the American theater.  I hate those creepy son pictures they put on.  Like the old son with the face and shit.  It's like nightmarish.  I watch Sunday morning.  I get the heebie-jeebies from things like that.  It's an easy watch in the morning on Sundays.  No stress.  Nah.  Someone that collects teapots and they're going through a house. 
[02:17:00]  The story before me was Bill Gates and his father and how they're such good pals.  Oh, really?  It's really easy to watch.  Yeah, it must be easy to be pals with a fucking billionaire.  Yeah, exactly.  The father's like, you know, hey, my son, he's not a complete fuck-up.  He's made billions of dollars.  Trillions.  I'm sure they get along great.  Yeah, no kidding.  I don't know why rich people ever fight.  Why would you fight?  Why would you fight?  Isn't, like, money the thing that everyone fights over?  Yeah, it makes all the difference.  If you're rich, you just go.  It's like money doesn't buy happiness. 
[02:17:30]  Yeah, but it sure pays for a lot of badness.  I just always imagine that rich people fight in families fighting.  It's like, fuck you.  Oh, well, let's go buy a, you know, castle.  Let's go fix it up.  Eat some gold.  And everybody's okay, yeah.  How was Father's Day, Lou?  Your daughters do anything special for you?  No.  They're not really at that age yet.  Well, they're eight and five.  They should be at that age.  They should be doing something for you.  Yeah, nothing.  What makes you warm inside? 
[02:18:00]  Nothing?  I got fucked.  Nothing.  I had my first Father's Day yesterday.  I know.  That's great, man.  And I didn't realize it turns into, like, a second birthday for you.  Yeah, it's great.  It's awesome.  I was getting cards from all...  A second birthday.  It is, though.  I was getting lottery tickets.  I was getting cash.  I got gifts.  I got cards from people.  I'm like, why are you giving me a Father's Day card?  That's right.  But, you know...  People came out of the woodwork.  I don't know why people outside of your family do it. 
[02:18:30]  I don't know why.  It was everyone that was a father...  I mean, I told my kids when I was yelling at them for forgetting it.  Fathers and Mother's Day is because we take care of them, you know?  Right.  So that's why we get a little more than just our birthday.  Yeah.  It's because we take care of them.  And I think your wife should give you something for Father's Day.  Great.  Because, you know, you're appreciating each other.  Sure.  Your role's in the household.  But other people outside the house, why are they giving a shit?  But then her grandparents gave me something.  Wow.  My wife's mom gave me something.  Well, that's your first one.  You won't get one next year. 
[02:19:00]  Probably not.  I think they wanted to make it a little special, which was awesome.  Next year, nothing.  And life's weird because the last five Father's Day days were, like, the worst day of the  year for me.  Yeah, because you're dead.  My pop's gone.  So it went from, like, ugh, I just want to, like, let this day...  Well, it's an interesting thing about how life...  The cycle of life.  Yes, sir.  And then also it's a cool day again.  That's fucked up.  I got in right under the wire, too, because him being a new dad, I was like, fuck, like,  8.30 at night.  I'm like, hey, happy Father's Day, Hopi.  Hope it was good. 
[02:19:30]  It was definitely...  I was like, whoosh, whoosh, under the wire.  Yeah, no, I was mad at my kids for forgetting.  And then I thought, should I call my dad?  And I thought, fuck that.  I'm not calling him.  Fuck that.  I didn't call him.  I was just surprised you thought of me outside the show.  I was like, wow, Jesus.  Thanks, man.  Well, because I was thinking it's like Father's Day, because then everybody was pretty much  leaving the house.  Yeah.  And it gave me time to think for a second.  I'm like, oh, yeah, new fathers.  There's a few of them.  Like stupid Travis.  I, you know.  Well, I... 
[02:20:00]  With his beard and his kid trying to hide that he's gay.  What did he do to do?  You really went the distance, didn't you?  Had a kid and everything.  Yeah, I'm all in.  I had to, uh...  Man, never mind.  Well, now I have to.  Now you have to.  I had to leave my kid for the first time yesterday.  I fucking...  All of a sudden I got teary-eyed.  Yeah, I'll admit it.  I got teary-eyed.  And everyone's like, you faggy.  I know.  In front of a house full of people down in Philly.  Tough...  There's some tough people in that house.  You mean you're going to be away from the kid for a while? 
[02:20:30]  For a couple days, because, you know, she's visiting family down there.  Philly, did they throw beer on you and fucking batteries?  Right.  Throwing batteries as I'm trying to leave the house.  Philly, fuck.  And I go, oh, this is what this is about.  Like, it finally hit me.  Like, oh, fuck.  Okay.  Yeah, I know, because you've been with this person their whole life, so...  Six weeks.  Yeah.  It's their whole life.  I'm at the point, because it's only six weeks, I'm convinced we're just babysitting.  Yeah.  I'm waiting for the parents to show up.  I'm like, oh, okay, that was nice.  I was babysitting for six weeks.  Yeah, that's what that's like.  I'm only starting to realize, wait a minute, this is... 
[02:21:00]  No, so I remember when my ex-wife gave birth.  She wasn't my ex-wife then.  She was still my wife.  Yeah.  We were divorced before the baby was born.  Right.  All that happens.  Oh, hell yeah.  I knew a guy, a writer, I worked on the Cedric the Entertainer show, and this writer, James,  he was, he had three kids, and he said, oh, when my wife gets pregnant, I just leave the  house.  I just leave for a while until the baby's born, then I come back.  Holy shit.  Really?  And I was like, seriously? 
[02:21:30]  What the hell is that?  He goes, because I was talking about how I was struggling in my marriage with, you know,  the new baby and all that stuff, and he goes, oh, yeah, well, when my wife gets  pregnant, I just leave, because she gets really, you know, hard to deal with.  So I just leave, and then I come back when the baby's already been born.  Wow.  And I'm like, how the fuck do you, because I'm like, how did you get away with that?  And he's like, well, what's she going to do?  She doesn't want to raise the kids by herself.  That's an amazing, wow, to totally use your leverage, to leave, and she's probably throwing  shit at him, just furious. 
[02:22:00]  He didn't divorce her, he'd just leave, go get an apartment somewhere, you know, stay  with friends.  And then he comes back, and she's like, I can't believe you left, and he's like, all right,  well, you want me to just, you want to divorce me, or what?  No, but you shouldn't have done that.  Yeah, ooh, whatever.  Wow.  I guess some people that run their relationship that way.  When I was married.  Fucking genius.  It is.  It works.  It was smart on his part.  Yeah.  When I was married, my wife, at one point, really wanted children, and I really did not. 
[02:22:30]  Yeah.  But, uh...  You faked it that you wanted children, though.  Yeah.  I remember those days.  I was like, yeah, all right.  No, I was going along with it, like I did with everything else in my life back then.  I just went along.  I was, don't make waves, Anthony.  Status quo.  Let's just, you know, never fucking actually bring up your opinion of how you feel about something.  Ugh.  I just want to smack myself.  Yeah.  Yeah, it was just terrible.  Time machine, man.  We're going back and smacking our own self.  I know.  I want to go back and just punch myself in the face.  Well, you get in these relationships where you just feel, uh, like forced into certain 
[02:23:00]  behavior.  You're on a track.  Yeah, you just can't change.  The second you get engaged, you're on a track that just, you have no more control over it.  So she wanted to have kids, um, and it was time to like, now, she said, no, we're  doing this now.  I'm taking prenatal vitamins and I'm doing this and that.  So I'm like, all right, I have to fake coming.  Oh my God.  I would fuck her.  Oh my God.  And I would make all the sounds, the faces, the moves. 
[02:23:30]  Oh my God.  And, and make believe I came really fucking shoved it in.  And then I'd lay there a while.  I wouldn't just pull right out.  You could think it got absorbed?  Yeah, it absorbed up.  Fucking went wherever it goes.  Oh my God.  And I would sit there and, uh, yeah, and then just be like, go in the bathroom, jerk  off, put little fucking Anthony Jr. down the toilet bowl.  Oh my God.  She never, cause I didn't want to have kids, but she didn't realize when she didn't feel  all squishy.  Yeah.  Sometimes they're not squishy. 
[02:24:00]  If you, if you come real deep and you fucking stay there a while, she's pretty stupid.  And she was stupid.  Thank you.  You know, with that whole thing.  I know you're contractually not allowed to say it, but she was a dumb cunt.  It's like, didn't you guys, uh, I'm not, I'm not in your divorce agreement.  Fuck her.  Stupid whore.  Fucking manipulative cunt.  Trying to make a man have a baby when you didn't want one.  It's about time.  Fucking stupid.  Didn't you?  Oh, we went to the, uh, the fertility specialist. 
[02:24:30]  They went to the fertility specialist because they thought something was wrong.  And the specialist said, well, your husband has to actually ejaculate.  Inside you.  Oh my God.  We're finding what the problem is.  Oh, he put my fucking shit.  There hasn't been a sperm in your body since 1975.  He, uh, he put my shit under a slide.  It looked like fucking nuclear reaction.  The shit was flying all over the place.  Oh my God.  Swimming like crazy.  Looked like LA after the Lakers won the championship.  Oh yeah.  Perfectly shaped little sperm heads that could just puncture an egg. 
[02:25:00]  It was great.  And then it's like, I don't know what the problem is.  Wow.  And there I am fucking sexually frustrated.  How many times did you fuck her that way do you think?  It was, it was every time she felt she was ovulating.  Oh my God.  And, uh.  Did you guys have a lot of sex back then?  No.  That wasn't either.  It was strictly for her getting pregnant.  So I would just not.  I don't know.  Not cum.  That's awful.  And then I'd piss her off sometimes and be fucking and then I'd pull out and cum on  her stomach.  Jesus.  She'd be like, what are you, what are you doing? 
[02:25:30]  Look at all that.  Yeah, we're supposed to do that.  Ah, what a waste.  I forgot.  That's gold.  I forgot you were trying to get pregnant.  Oh.  I forgot.  It slipped out.  Yeah.  That's twisted though, man.  Yeah.  Well, I didn't want the things you'll do.  I did not want a fucking kid.  That's for sure.  Thank God I didn't have one.  Anytime you're in a relationship where you're like complaining to a friend about.  Unhappiness.  Yeah.  And the friend goes, why don't you just tell her?  Something like that.  Yeah.  And you go, oh, no. 
[02:26:00]  Yeah.  That's crazy.  Maybe that's how you do stuff.  That means you're in a bad place.  Yeah.  That means you're in a bad place.  That means you should not be in that relationship.  You should be able to, wherever you are in a relationship, you should be able to turn  to the person you're with and say, this stinks.  Yeah.  I hate this.  This is a bad thing.  And even if it's not an easy thing to say, you should be able to say it and absorb it and deal  with it.  How about this one?  When you finally do break up and everyone around you goes, yeah, we all knew.  Oh, really?  I saw that coming a mile away. 
[02:26:30]  It's like, thanks.  You couldn't have saved me five or six fucking years.  No.  How about you speak up?  Why are you around me?  Well, what do you do?  That's a good question, though.  If you have a friend who's in a bad relationship and they really, and they fight, well, you  know what?  And they probably did say, hey, are you sure that's cool that she talks to you like that?  No, no, no.  It's, see, and there's a whole thing where it's offset by this.  And then they go, all right, well.  You've got to wait for a cue, though, from them.  You can't just step in and badmouth this chick or something.  She's a bitch, man.  You've got to leave and you lose a friend. 
[02:27:00]  But the second you get an inkling that they're not happy, that's your duty now as a friend  to step in and go, look, here's the deal.  If you're even considering not doing this, don't fucking do it.  Where were you when I needed you?  Where the fuck was anybody when I needed them?  Yeah, we fucked up.  It's a hard thing to do.  Or then it ends and they go, well, it's about time.  Yeah.  Oh, thanks.  You can fucking maybe have somebody write a note, your thoughts, but someone else's 
[02:27:30]  handwriting and just fucking leave it in my car one day.  Yeah, leave some anonymous.  Leave some photos of the girl with fucking ten black guys.  Make me want to leave.  Right.  Help me out here.  I had a friend who was dating, who had a girlfriend, and one day he just woke up.  This is the way he tells the story.  He woke up and he got out of bed and didn't know why he was doing this.  He just walked to her house, rang the doorbell, and found one of his best friends. 
[02:28:00]  Wow.  He just had a inkling.  And he thinks that it's some sort of weird, like, psychic thing.  Yeah.  But what it was, was they were clearly fucking for ages, and his body, like, grabbed him  by the collar and said, idiot, just look at this.  It's happening every day.  It's happening.  How dumb are you?  I should have noticed.  But he thinks it's like this one time they fucked, and he incredibly picked up on it.  Damn.  Nothing worse than being cheated on if you do, like, care about somebody. 
[02:28:30]  Yeah.  Although, I don't think I cared about the person, but I was, that whole infatuation thing,  I used to get myself caught up in.  Yeah.  Infatuation with that love disguise on.  Mm-hmm.  Infatuation can dress like love, and it walks around, and you're like, it's love.  And then you're like, holy shit, that's infatuation.  Yep.  And, uh, there's a girl, and then she ends up with, like, one of my best friends, which  is just like, well, can you just take one guy in between me and my best friend? 
[02:29:00]  You just, it's easy for you to fuck.  Go to a bar, find an anonymous guy, fuck him, and then, like, ease into my best friend shit.  Yeah, you got the pussy, you can get laid any time you want.  Because now I don't have you or my best friend, because I can't hang out with him, because  he's fucking you.  No.  It's, like, terrible.  I was, uh, when I was writing at Conan, there was a woman that worked in the office, and  we were fucking around.  Like, we would just fuck once in a while.  And I liked her, but we didn't, mostly, we just fucked occasionally.  And one night, she went to, we went to dinner, and she said, I don't want to do this anymore, 
[02:29:30]  because I want a serious relationship.  And I want to be with somebody, you know, have a real companion.  And I was like, wow.  And I hadn't had a girlfriend in a long time, and I said, so you're saying you want to make  the next step?  And I was like, well, I, I like you.  Yeah, we should be.  Oh, no.  And I said, yeah, let's be together.  Okay.  And I was kind of really excited.  Wow.  It's, I kind of have a girlfriend now.  And yeah, okay.  And she was like, there's something weird about the way she was acting as I was saying all  this.  She was like, yeah, okay.  And then the next day, I go to work, and she's, no, she's going out with another writer. 
[02:30:00]  She meant, she was starting to say, I wanted a serious relationship, so I'm going out with  this guy.  Yeah, yeah.  But I started saying all this shit, and she just let me train wreck into saying, so now  you and I are together.  And she's like, all right.  And the next day, she's with him, and they got married.  Wow.  I was like, fuck.  I just felt like an idiot.  Well, we got the phones lit on this topic. 
[02:30:30]  Brian in Maryland.  We're hanging with Louis C.K., by the way.  Let's get another plug in.  Louis, next Tuesday, it's his new show on FX.  Saw the first four episodes.  I think the audience is going to love this one, 11 o'clock next Tuesday on FX.  Brian, what do you got?  Hey, just classic Al.  I was talking about, you know, everyone doesn't like whoever you hear about it after the fact.  Well, I was married seven damn years.  Found out that everyone in my family hated her.  No one had the balls to tell me.  And you know what's bad? 
[02:31:00]  When your grandmother even hates her.  You know.  They never have an opinion.  You're supposed to love everybody.  Come to find out, my grandmother didn't even like her.  I was like, Jesus Christ, can anybody just tell me?  Yeah, you realize that the whole family was like, every time you'd leave the room with the girl,  they would be like, oh, fuck that bitch.  They don't want to lose that thing to talk about.  Families love that.  Yeah, they love that little fucking...  Families love having somebody that marries and that they hate.  I think Louis made a good point, though.  You don't know what to do.  You know what I mean? 
[02:31:30]  It's a tough situation.  It's rough, especially when you're younger, because you don't have the experience.  It's like, as you get older, you just start realizing, I don't give a fuck.  Oh, no.  I'm going to be honest and say what I feel.  No, exactly.  And I tell people...  I've met people that I know five minutes, and I'm like, yeah, no, you've got to leave her.  Yeah.  Yeah, but when she's pregnant, it doesn't matter.  Get out.  Get out, leave now.  The younger people, you just let be, because you know they're going to figure it out themselves.  Let them crash and burn themselves.  It's when they're in their 30s.  You're like, what the fuck?  You'll recover.  But that goes with everything, like even relationships now. 
[02:32:00]  I find myself not trying so hard to juggle and be dishonest.  No, no, you've got to do that.  Now I'm just honest guy, and I'll say like, yeah, this is what's going on.  Yeah.  There have been many times I've said, I'm not boyfriend material guy anymore.  Yeah.  I'm just not.  I've been wrecked.  Yeah.  I've been wrecked on relationships, and I've said this.  You were boyfriend guy for 20 years.  I was married in there, but boyfriend guy for that.  Since I've been 14 years old and had my first girlfriend, I have been in a relationship that 
[02:32:30]  has lasted a while, and they usually overlapped.  You know, I'd be like, oh, I found another girl, this one, that one, that.  Until I realized, you know, I'm in my 40s, and I just got out of the relationship with  Melinda that lasted like eight years, and then I just decided, you know what?  Fuck this.  And then you get together with a girl, you start talking, and you try to tell them how 
[02:33:00]  you feel, and at first they were just like, absolutely, that's exactly how I feel.  I don't want the relationship, this, we're just having fun, we'll do that.  A week, two weeks later, you notice the relationship things start coming into play.  The texts and the little snide comments, the claws come out, the thing.  And then you realize, and I'll say, this is starting to resemble something I don't like.  Right.  You know, and the reason I'm not seeing you all the time is because I like that spontaneity. 
[02:33:30]  I like, the second something becomes routine and a relationship, it sucks.  The sex will start sucking, it'll get mundane and repetitive.  And if you don't see someone for a week or two weeks, you want to fucking like ravage them,  you know, so why wreck it by having us have to sit next to each other and watch TV every 
[02:34:00]  night?  Yeah, no, if it's not what you want, then it's not what you want.  It's not bringing any kind of comfort.  I think the most bad relationships are because somebody's doing that that doesn't really  want to.  Right.  They're in it and don't want to be.  They don't want to lose the other person, so they play it.  No, it's great when you get older and more honest, you don't care.  Yeah.  And after I got divorced, one of the first girls that I dated, we went out a few times  and then one day we were in front of my building and it was in the middle of the day and she  kissed me like kind of passionately and it was daylight and I was standing where I usually  am walking with my kids in a stroller and I hadn't had a thing with anybody and it just 
[02:34:30]  brought home to me like I'm kind of with somebody.  This is what this is.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And I don't like it.  And then the next day she was on the phone with me and she's like, is there something weird?  Are you getting a weird vibe from you?  And my old me would have said, no, no, no, no, no, totally like, you know what it is?  It's that I was thinking about this thing and I, but, but no, you're awesome.  Why is that?  But I didn't, I just went, yeah, you got a weird vibe because we kissed on the street 
[02:35:00]  and it made me realize I got to stop seeing you.  I'm not in it.  I can't do that.  I'm not on a point in my life where this is a good thing to do and I want to stop.  And there was like this silence.  Then she went, thank you very much.  That was so much easier than Amelia.  Like first she was really stunned.  She liked the honesty though.  She was like, thank God for a guy who did just fucking says it instead of me.  Cause I could have, I would have hung in there for like six months of not enjoying a moment 
[02:35:30]  with her.  Same fucking situation.  Cause I didn't want to come out and say, this is not good.  You're great, but well, not great enough for me to hang out with because that's always  the underlying thing that you don't want to say.  I don't know why that snap judgment thing makes you go.  No, no, it's not you.  It's like, it's like you're in trouble with your mom.  Anthony, do you not want to fuck me anymore?  No mom.  I want to fuck you all day.  I'm sorry, mommy.  Now that's good. 
[02:36:00]  You fuck my pussy.  Very good.  We got lots of great phone calls going in.  It's one of those situations you do, you get, uh, you get, you get older and, but the  bad thing about it is you never want to sound cliche and that, that whole, this point in  my life, it just sounds like, I try to say it in the blunt, like the thing I try to do  now with every relationship or even a moment with somebody in the street is whatever is  in my mouth.  I try to say exactly what I feel without being polite.  If you try to say it politely, it comes out sounding like a bad chick flick line. 
[02:36:30]  Well, because it sounds like you're, you're covering what's real and what's real is not  as bad as you think it's the fact that you're covering makes her think that there's something  much worse and they make her think that you just are grossed out by her.  You don't like her.  She's not attractive.  And so you're making something up, whereas really you're just being a coward.  You just don't want to do this.  I don't want to.  I got a gut feeling.  I don't like it.  I don't want to stop now. 
[02:37:00]  Yeah.  I want to stop.  Yeah.  That's it.  That's it.  I'm done.  I'm done with the thing of talking to you.  You guys are the exception though, obviously.  You know, I mean, that's what we got to the exception through divorce.  Yeah.  Oh yeah.  The exception came very late in life.  I was going to say that's so hard.  It sounds great, but it's so hard for most people to do.  It shouldn't be.  If you do it every minute, then, you know, I mean, there's like a million stupid Mark  20 type quotes about if you would never lie, you always don't have to remember  anything.  If you, if you always tell the truth, you never have to remember anything.  Yeah.  When you start lying, it's, oh, you just start creating a, let me grab a bad, I'm a bad liar. 
[02:37:30]  There's a lot of people in marriages who are like, I shouldn't be in this, but how long  could I possibly live?  They're not resigning themselves to death.  Yeah.  Let me grab this call.  I don't want to lose this guy.  He's miserable.  Maybe we can help him out.  Jim in Staten Island.  Jim.  Oh, man.  This is Jimmy Greco.  Listener number three from a very long time ago.  Oh, right on, Jimmy Greco.  I remember you.  Yeah.  What's up, boys?  I'm in a miserable marriage with a miserable fat cunt. 
[02:38:00]  The only thing she does is, the only interaction she has with me is, what's your check look  like?  Okay?  I fucking, the minute I turn around and I go to go stand up for myself, I used to have  a substance problem.  So right away, are you using, it's just a miserable fucking addiction.  I would fucking leave, but I have a beautiful four-year-old son.  And I don't want to leave this boy with this sick fucking cunt.  Okay?  You know, I jerk off more now than I ever did before. 
[02:38:30]  This morning, as I'm getting ready to work, I said, let me throw X in that text.  And let me look for something to beat the fuck off to.  Beat the fuck off to.  Well, listen to this poor guy.  I know.  He's just miserable.  How is your check?  And are you drinking?  Yeah.  That's what I want to know.  I had a drink or a drug in fucking 109 days.  And I said, now I'm going to do it.  109.  Wow, 109 days.  When you're saying fucking 109 days, you better go to a meeting.  Yeah, you're not meeting now.  You're not going to make 115, sir. 
[02:39:00]  Hey, it also says she beat you.  Is that true?  No, she's taking a couple of swings at me here right now.  I don't want to put her through a fucking world.  Did you ever hit her?  No.  No, I did a call on to her once.  She fucking ran into the bathroom, and I fucking popped open the door, and then she  sunk down to the ground, and I said, don't you ever fucking raise your fucking head to  me again.  Okay?  Why?  All right.  Listen, listen.  That's your...  That was like a treat.  I bet his four-year-old is having a ball or something. 
[02:39:30]  These people sound awesome.  He wasn't home when this shit happened.  Now, Jim, that's...  All right.  Listen, I'm going to jump in.  That's your side of the story, and I believe every word of it.  Now, why would she stay in this thing, then, Lou?  Well, I don't know.  I don't know why.  Some people...  There's always one...  She obviously is miserable, too.  There's always one person in a bad relationship who's perfectly happy to be in a bad relationship.  There's always one person who's, like, who's fine with it.  Who's fine with just constant shitty...  Yeah.  The only thing I would say to you, sir, is that you're not going to lose your kid if 
[02:40:00]  you leave this woman.  You get to keep the kid.  Right.  But you want to know what?  I don't want him to have that in the back of his mind.  You know?  Now, do you want to...  You're a coward.  Now, the other way to look at it is your son's learning that if somebody...  Well, just call me a coward.  Jim, just calm down.  You're calling a comedy show.  Please try to remember that.  Jim, this isn't this kind of show.  We're doing the best we can.  Yeah, I have no problem saying it, Jim.  I hope he said it. 
[02:40:30]  Because I was there.  I was a coward, too.  Like, why are you staying?  First of all, I don't want to lose half my shit.  Well, that's a very good answer.  We've talked about that on the show a lot.  It's not a good reason to stay.  It's a good question.  I don't want to leave my kid.  Number three?  What the fuck do I do?  The only person who's going to win is...  People procrastinate.  People don't pay their bills on time.  You're going to fucking file for divorce.  You know what a pain in the ass it is?  No, it's a huge pain in the ass.  You've got a lawyer.  Yeah, but here's the thing. 
[02:41:00]  To get it started.  The two things.  I don't want to lose my kid.  I don't want to lose half my shit.  I mean, they're both beatable.  Because, first of all, you have this idea that your kid's going to grow up thinking,  my dad left us.  It'll be true if you leave the classic way of just, like, take off.  Get beat dad.  And just show up once a week to take your kid to an awkward fucking little league game.  They have nothing to say to you.  I remember seeing this father with his daughter, and it was so clear that it was like a visitation. 
[02:41:30]  Yeah.  And they're walking down the street, and he goes, well, we've got two hours left.  What do you want to do?  And she goes, I don't know.  It was so depressing.  He really gave this thought.  Yeah, so it's not.  That's a shitty father who divorced and then just kind of marginalized their kid.  But if you fight for your right to be with your kid, and you fight for your custody time,  then what your kid will.  Because if you don't do that, the thing you teach your kid is that if a person is abusive to you,  you stay with them anyway.  It's not a good signal to give a kid is that if you're in a shit marriage with a bad person 
[02:42:00]  or you're a bad person, that these guys stay together.  So that isn't.  So I don't buy that you're not going to keep your kid.  The kid's aware.  Jim, the kid's aware that it's a nightmare.  The kid's living in a house of misery.  Right.  So if you separate, then both of you become happier people, and the kid lives in two homes  that are happier than one shit home.  So that's a plus for the kid.  And then as far as half your shit, well, fucking be a man and raise twice the money.  Just work harder. 
[02:42:30]  I mean, really, it's that I like the fact that I'm paying shit to my ex because she didn't  have a job when we split up.  But it puts me at zero, and then it just motivates me.  I work much harder now.  And anyway, I had to take care of her before.  And it actually, if you look at it this way, it reduces your nut with the other person to  a check.  You have one check that you write.  I mean, it's not like that.  When you're married, it's not like that. 
[02:43:00]  You fight over money.  She spends whatever she wants.  She's got your bank book.  But once you get divorced, you write one check, and it's contained to that.  It's not what it is.  And you call that zero.  You just move the zero line in your mind to after she's gotten hers.  That's exactly how I rationalized it.  That's, and then you go zero.  Now I got nothing.  I was happy to give away whatever I had so that I could be at a clean me zero.  And then if I raise ten bucks, I spend eight of it on Snickers bars.  Can I ask you a question about that, though? 
[02:43:30]  Shove the ninth dollar up my ass, and it's my business.  If you didn't have the kids, that would be a tough check to write, though.  Like in Ant's case, he had to write that check, and he had no connection with her.  Oh, yeah.  Kids that he loves or any of that shit.  You know what I mean?  Like with you, you almost could rationalize it.  Like, well, because of my relationship with her, I got these two beautiful daughters.  Oh, well, child support and alimony are two totally different things.  But it makes it a little easier to write her the check.  I'm just saying.  I don't know.  Or does it?  Well, child support is, yeah, I mean, it's just a totally different category. 
[02:44:00]  Child support is something that you pay until the kids are 21 years old.  But I'm saying the actual check to her is a little easier because you know you had the kids with her.  Or in Anthony's case, just writing to her a check.  Oh, I did not want to write that check.  Yeah, no, it's totally easier.  Didn't want to write that check.  The best check was the last check.  Yeah, sure.  That was when it was all done.  And then I was like, oh, I got a raise.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, Jim, did we help you out there?  You made me feel a little bit better. 
[02:44:30]  Actually, Louis made me feel better because he lost a lot more than I could ever lose.  So, you know.  All right.  And I'm sorry I called you a coward, but I've been there.  I was in a relationship I should have got out of, safe to say, six years before I did.  All right, boy, I've got to tell you this.  Congratulations on your son.  Thank you.  And enjoy him as much as you can.  And, and, and.  Here's the sappy part.  And you're a fucking gift, man.  I mean, I love my boy more than anything.  All he wants to do is play weed, cuddle, and fucking just hang out. 
[02:45:00]  And, and, and I love him.  But I, I, I just can't.  If you get, if you get, if you get divorced and you fight for, uh, time with your kid,  you'll have that time with, with your kid by yourself.  And you'll thank fucking shit Christ for that.  Or whoever you pray to.  Louis, good luck with the new show, man.  Good luck with the new show.  Thanks, buddy.  Yeah, it's going to be a great one, Jim.  All right.  Wow.  Now, uh, we've just turned into a relationship show.  Look at these fucking folks.  That happens.  We can take a break and take more phone calls.  We can do that. 
[02:45:30]  Louis, you sticking around or you got to go?  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm here for another 45 minutes or so.  Perfect, man.  All right.  Louis C.K. in studio.  Don't go anywhere.

Brokerage was awesome.  I was on Long Island.  I was trying to get away from the baby thing.  Oh, I had such a good time there.  We're just not ready.  I can't separate yet.  No, sure. 
[02:50:30]  I've got to be right in there for a little longer.  Yeah, of course.  I mean, but I was trying to get away.  She was cool with it.  She was like, go see Louie.  She was jealous because she loves you.  And, I don't know, a poopy diaper, a scream, and a fucking bottle feeding later.  No, no, you've got to play it for the rest of your life to do that.  It's not that long that it ends up being.  Everyone says about three months, right?  Is that about it?  Yeah, I don't know.  I think...  Where it gets easier.  It starts to a little bit.  They stop being a critical, like a critical case.  Yeah.  The kid starts having a little bit of a rhythm.  But they go up and down.  You're going to have plenty of...  I feel like I'm in the emergency room every night. 
[02:51:00]  Yeah.  It's kind of like that.  It's like it's touch and go every night.  When does this end, Louie?  I'm like that.  Tell me out.  No, a lot of it is...  He knows.  A lot of it is your perception, too.  Like, I remember when we first had our baby.  The doctor said, if she cries and you just can't make her stop crying, call the doctor.  Like, if she's really, totally out of control, can't stop crying.  Yeah.  So, one night, the baby was crying and crying.  And I said, I think this is it.  We've got to call the doctor.  She just...  This has been...  You know...  So, I called the doctor to something... 
[02:51:30]  Like, at the fucking midnight.  And the doctor says, how long has she been crying?  And we looked at each other.  I'm like, five minutes.  They were talking like an hour or something.  But it felt, after five minutes, like, this is totally a disaster.  Not going to stop.  It's just perception.  You just get used to stuff.  I'm used to it now.  Yeah, it's more what's going on inside of you than the baby knows exactly what it's doing.  The baby's a genius.  But they don't teach you shit in the hospital.  You're there for two days.  No, of course not.  Teach us some real shit.  Like, they don't tell you that the kid will make some really fucked up noises in the middle 
[02:52:00]  of the night, which you will be convinced is something horrible.  Yeah.  And it's just normal.  It's like Jay Moore explains in his book.  It's like you're living in a zoo or something.  There's a lot of animal noises coming from the crib.  They don't tell you that.  I thought it was a snore or a cry.  That's all you're worrying about.  Yeah, I know.  These weird fucked up noises.  It doesn't breathe right at first because it's still figuring out its lungs.  They don't tell you this stuff.  Yeah.  Oh, that's pretty creepy.  But now a lot of those noises we hear, we're like, oh, okay.  That's what that is.  That's the, yeah. 
[02:52:30]  Yeah.  Parents are learning.  That's what they're, it's all, the kid's raising you, really.  I mean, the kid knows, the kid develops at its own pace.  Yeah.  But you have a learning curve.  And not as many feedings, so we're good.  We're starting to sleep a little bit.  Knock on, whatever.  It'll change.  The ride.  It changes again?  It'll get bad again, yeah.  It always does.  What are you talking about?  And the kid has growth spurts.  They'll have growth spurts where they just constantly feed.  Does she breastfeed the kid?  Yeah.  So there'll be times where she just, she'll start just saying, this fucking kid is chewing 
[02:53:00]  the shit out of my nipple.  I can't take it.  It gets really, really hard.  And then there'll be like, she could get her nipple, get raw or infected, all kinds of  stuff.  It just gets, it just, then she'll have to pump breast milk because she's making too much  and the kid's not feeding enough.  Holy shit.  If the kid's not eating enough and her breasts get bloated, so she has to pump the breast  milk out.  And then you have these rotting little jars of breast milk around the house.  Holy's been there.  Oh, God.  Damn. 
[02:53:30]  It's just so many things.  Do you have a dog?  No, no.  No, we had our dog.  When our dog got mad, like dogs will punish you, you know, like if you leave them at home  too long, we'd come home, the dog would go through the baby's diapers and spread baby shit  all over the house.  Shit like that.  And you'd come home, motherfucker, just screaming at the dog.  I could not imagine that.  The baby's crying.  You know, it gets tough.  It's endurance.  Boy, I was looking for a little hope here today.  And then the teeth come in and that fucking hurts.  And then the teeth fall out. 
[02:54:00]  Okay, I get it.  And then the new teeth come in.  I get it.  I actually brought this up hoping you weren't going to help me out today.  No, it's, well, you get used to it is what happens.  You get immune to it and then it just comes what you do.  It's all good.  Yeah.  It just comes what you do.  No, so far, so good.  I'm fucking, I'm loving it.  I'm loving it, so.  But yeah, the brokerage is a good club.  Yeah, I really, I was dying to see, because I haven't seen you in a while.  I'm like, fuck.  And it was right there.  I like those Long Island rooms.  They're fun.  Just don't like getting out there, right?  The traffic, by the way.  Ah, that's too, that's too local. 
[02:54:30]  What we can move on.  No, it's insane.  I know.  I hate that.  To get to New York City to Long Island is just.  That's a little bottleneck of one road.  Yeah.  It takes all night.  All right, let's go back to the phones.  Jeff in Jersey, hanging with Louis C.K. today.  That was a great setup, Jeff.  Let's go.  Hello.  Hey.  How are you?  Great.  That doesn't matter.  Hey.  No, I just wanted to, I just wanted to make a comment about that guy who was staying with  his marriage because of his son. 
[02:55:00]  I'm a long time listener.  And I used to listen to Anthony about his nightmare stories and his wedding.  And it felt like he was talking about myself.  And I would say the same thing.  I wanted to stay for my kids.  And they got to an age where one day one of my kids turns to me and says, Dad, you and  Mom are never going to get along, huh?  Because we are so unhappy that you guys are together.  And it really, really woke me up to realize that, yeah, me and my wife were miserable 
[02:55:30]  with each other.  And when I was upstairs, she was downstairs.  I was in the kitchen.  She was in the living room, totally avoiding each other, never doing anything together as  a family with the kids.  So I neglected to realize that me miserable, my wife miserable, made the household miserable.  The kids were miserable.  Yeah, that's what happens.  Fucking trotting around the house.  Yeah, there's not.  There's just funny at the wall.  This thing of trying to stay together, if it's not working, I mean, if you feel like 
[02:56:00]  when you have a fight, you get somewhere, I think that's the key.  It's like, how do you know whether to stick in there?  I think if you feel like after you have a fight, you just made it an opportunity to open  up, you know, like you go, okay, look, I get it.  And you see a little more of the other, if you feel like you see the other person's point  of view.  But if you leave, if you have a fight with your wife or husband, and you're now in the  other room going, you fucking cunt.  It's just nasty.  And you just had to get away from each other because it got that bad.  Even that, that happens.  But if that's chronic, then it's like, yeah, I don't think it, I, there's nothing wrong 
[02:56:30]  if you look at it from like a biological National Geographic, you know, how lions mate and that  kind of thing.  If the, the idea that we come together as a couple, you cohabitate, you build a home,  you have children, you raise the children past a certain critical point, and then you  separate and raise the children in two separate homes.  The fuck is wrong with that?  Yeah.  There's nothing wrong with that.  There was nothing wrong with that. 
[02:57:00]  And that's where I came to realize a long time, 10 years into a nightmare of a marriage.  And I finally came to realize when my, my kids was finally old enough to say that to me.  And I was like, you know what?  They're right.  And I saw, I started the proceedings.  I fall for divorce.  And, uh, you know what?  Now, now everybody's happy when the kids are with me.  They're happy.  I'm happy.  I get to enjoy them, appreciate them, uh, make memories with them.  And they do the same thing with the mother. 
[02:57:30]  I call up to say goodnight to talk to them, see how the school was or whatever.  And, and they tell me, yeah, we did this with mommy.  We, we did that with mommy.  And, and, uh, so I see a totally big, different change.  Good for you, man.  And, uh, no, man, I just wanted to tell that guy, you know what?  Uh, uh, I know for one thing, my wife used to, uh, torture me with, uh, you're going to lose.  You're going to be the one that's the short end of the stick.  You're never going to see your kids.  You're not going to have the visitation with that, but I'm going to have sole custody. 
[02:58:00]  And it's all bullshit.  The court systems don't want it that way anymore.  No, they don't.  They don't.  It's very, very hard.  Really?  It's very hard to lose custody of your kids.  If you're, if you're a father and you get divorced and I'm talking straight out of my ass, but if you, if you go, if you go to the court or whatever, or, you know, when you get divorced, if you make a case and say, I want this amount of time with my kids.  Yeah.  It's there, they have, they have to prove that there's something tractably and like convicted, convictable wrong with you. 
[02:58:30]  Some other evil shit.  It has to be like, you're a fucking chronic criminal.  Even if you have done some, even if you have a criminal fucking history, they can't just take away your, they can't take away your, your, your rights to custody of your kids.  Cause your wife is mad at you.  The courts, the courts want it this way.  Now they give you a 50% custody of your children because they don't want any deadbeat fathers out there.  And as far as that, uh, that you're going to lose all your money to all that. 
[02:59:00]  And that is all crap.  You know what?  They have a, they have a system now.  And you know, like, like when I was married, I was lucky if I was getting a hundred dollars a week out of my pay.  You know what?  I got the worst.  I got a raise.  I can have my paycheck now.  Well, that's exactly the thing.  And you get control of it.  So, I mean, you are, you, unless there was something weird going on in your house, you're paying your wife half of everything anyway, or more like you're saying.  And any father that says, I got divorced and I, my wife took my kids away is a liar. 
[02:59:30]  He gave his kids up.  It means he didn't put the fight up and he didn't, and he also didn't step up and become a, you got to change your life.  You have to change the way you're going to do your life.  You have to start, I mean, you have to rearrange your life so that you can take care of your kids by yourself.  But it is better for the kids, I think.  All right.  Didn't hang it in there.  Thanks, Jeff.  Hey, no problem.  Thank you, guys.  This is turning into a very special opening show.  Yeah, I know, man.  It's fucking serious shit.  What else is going on out there in the world? 
[03:00:00]  These guys always sound like that.  Huh?  Yeah.  I don't know what happened.  Got this, uh, wife.  She was a fucking cunt.  Fat cunt wife.  So I love my kids.  They all sound like that.  They don't really sound like the most appealing people.  Like I just said, my fat cunt wife, and I'm, I describe myself, I look like Brad Pitt.  I went to Harvard.  I'm a fucking catch over here.  I'm the greatest guy ever.  Fat cunt. 
[03:00:30]  You should see me.  I'm beautiful.  But see, it's a special.  I'm a genius.  And it's a special case, once again, because he tells a story.  He gets married on his wedding night.  He looked at the ceiling and had tears in his eyes.  He knew he made a mistake.  A lot of people don't feel like they're making a mistake from day one.  Maybe a couple years in, you start going, holy shit, what the fuck is this about?  No, I think most people do.  You think most people realize?  Yeah.  A lot of people, I think, get married because they're trying to fix their relationship. 
[03:01:00]  A lot of people get married.  A lot of people get married to make their girlfriend happy.  Like, they don't get married to begin.  It's like what you're saying about you're waiting for somebody to come and pick the real parents to pick up the kid.  I remember when we were at the hospital and my wife was in labor, the whole time I thought, I realized that I was really thinking, we're going to go through this.  She's going to go through labor and go through this thing that we've been training for and reading books about.  Yeah.  And then she's going to have a kid, then we're going to go home and get a pizza.  And I did not picture taking a kid home with us. 
[03:01:30]  Like, when we put the kid in the thing in the car, I was like, holy shit, this is our lives now.  That's so, and I think it's like that for some people really get married because they're like, my girlfriend's pissed off.  We'll have a wedding and then she'll feel better.  And then you realize, oh my God, I'm fucking married now.  You had the wedding and now you're married.  I obviously take a lot of trips to Philly and usually we get up and go.  Let's pack your bag.  I pack my bag. 
[03:02:00]  I'll call for the car and we're out of here, right?  Yeah.  That same little thing took about at least two extra hours.  It's like doing the same thing you're used to doing, but completely numb your right arm and your left arm and then attempt to do that, what you're used to doing.  That's how I felt.  You know what?  It's great, though.  That part I liked, that your life gets that much harder because you just get more, you adapt and you get more competent.  Like I remember feeling like a Vietnam, like the guys in Nam who have those big heavy rifles. 
[03:02:30]  The big packs on their back.  Yeah, you've got like a gun belt down the right side.  And when you stand up, all this clanging armor and you're walking with all this shit and that's me at like, you know, taking my kids to Coney Island.  I take them to Coney Island in the summer a lot and I've got all this shit.  I've got each kid's bag.  I've got my stuff.  I've got all that fucking crap.  I'm like, let's move out.  And we start moving a few clicks down the beach. 
[03:03:00]  We get to a bad beach.  All right, we need to move.  I've got one crying, so I've got to pick her up.  The other one I've got by the hand and you just move and you become.  It just sounds like so much work.  Well, if you attack it like I'm a guy and I'm, you know what I mean?  I've got muscles and I can make this work.  You're the Sarge.  Yeah, and then it's positive if you look at it that way.  It really is to me a point of like an attitude thing.  If you really are like waiting for mom to tell you, give you a list of shit to do and you're just sort of like, yes, dear. 
[03:03:30]  Then it's depressing.  But if you take it on like, here's what we're doing.  And then you get good at that, getting the shit in the car, it gets satisfying.  I'm amazed at how well I do shit now.  Yeah.  I always sucked at doing shit, but I could set up some shit.  Yeah, you'll get.  Pack of plays and all that.  They're like, you set that up really quick.  I'm like, oh, yeah, you fucking did.  If you bring male skills to raising a kid, it's really satisfying.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I got male skills all of a sudden because before that I was useless. 
[03:04:00]  I have to think about how quickly I can tear apart my AR-15, clean it, and put it back together again.  There you go.  It's pretty much where I'm at with being good at stuff.  See, and here's this without the emotional attachment you do have.  Right.  Exactly.  But I'll tell you something.  That's what makes it.  I'm just hearing logistics.  Yeah, you're just hearing logistics.  Pretending to come into that fucking cunt for as long as you did, I think you should be sainted for that.  I really do.  Believe me.  That's, you should be sainted. 
[03:04:30]  That took courage.  That was not wanting a kid.  I'm serious.  That's the thing that everybody doesn't do.  Most guys would just say, ah, fuck it.  Yeah, just fuck her, have a kid, see how that goes.  No, the most frightening thing to me would be to have a kid.  You would have had a bad, that would have been bad for you.  Yeah, not good.  Not good.  No.  I like places like Atlantis and Vegas, and I like just going there.  Yep. 
[03:05:00]  Drop of a hat.  I like leaving and going there.  That was one of the coolest things when I got divorced, was realizing I can just get on a plane and go to another city.  I don't even have to tell anybody.  I got a passport and an Amex.  Yeah.  That's it.  I don't need a suitcase.  I don't need clothes on my back.  I'll buy shit when I get there.  It's amazing.  Yeah.  Don't pack socks.  Just buy socks.  That's it.  Yeah.  Fuck it.  Or packing in a hotel and just going, I'm going to leave half these clothes in this room.  Yeah, who cares?

[03:10:00]  He said you guys used to hang out all the time.  Yeah.  Mike Watson.  I don't know even the name Mike.  It sounds weird to me right now.  And then you start feeling bad, like you don't want it to get whoever it is.  Like, geez, maybe I had a really good friend.  And so I start going, oh, yeah, Mike Watson.  Oh, yeah.

The worst is when people come up to you and don't even say a friend. 
[03:10:30]  They just go, you don't remember me, do you?  I had that happen, swear to God, Saturday.  I was at this party, and a high school friend was there, so he brought some of his friends,  I guess, to the party.  And this guy, Rob, I'm leaving.  He goes, you don't remember me, do you?  I go, yeah, I remember you.  You fucking hated me in high school.  Never paid attention to me.  But now, because I have some kind of, quote, fame, you feel like you have a connection to me.  Yes, I do know who you are.  We were wrong, Rupert. 
[03:11:00]  But I'm like, we were wrong, Rupert, and you, you were right.  Yes, exactly.  I'm like, of course I remember you.  You fucking hated me in school, thought I was a fucking nerd, and never paid any attention  to me in high school.  Yeah, I do remember you.  I don't remember when they say that.  They go, you don't remember me.  And I'm trying.  In this case, I did remember.  Now I just go, no.  I don't.  Yeah, it's another, I'm the same way with the honesty now.  Yeah.  With people that I don't know.  It's like, no.  Do you remember me?  Nope.  No.  Sorry.  Oh my God, I'm insulted.  That's, I'm sorry you feel that way, so go. 
[03:11:30]  You shouldn't have quizzed me like that.  No.  You should have said, hi, my name is, back in whatever, we fucking hung out at the, but  you quizzed me, and now you're paying for it.  I did a show last night in New Jersey, and this kid came up to me afterwards, and he had  a folder with him, and he said, I have to talk to you, okay?  And I'm like, uh.  Jesus, one of these.  He's this dossier.  He goes, I have some, he goes, and I, this is weird, and I'm like, yeah, it is, and I'd  like to stop it now by walking away, and he goes, uh, he goes, I want, I want to be 
[03:12:00]  a writer, and I want your show to be good, so, and I go, I don't write, I have writers.  I stop them there.  I don't have writers on my show.  I write it all myself, and he goes, I don't believe that, and I said, yeah, I do, and  he goes, you can't write a whole show by yourself, so I just, now I start walking  away.  He's like, yeah.  And he goes, just please read my material.  Just take it and read it, and I go, I'm not going to read it, so I'm not going to take  it from you and pretend, and go throw it out 10 feet from here.  I'm not going to go through that, so no, good luck to you.  And then have you sue me when a show comes up, and then you just say, that was my idea, 
[03:12:30]  and good luck, but no, I'm not going to read it.  And he goes, I don't understand why.  And I thought for a second I was going to struggle and, like, try to explain it to him, but then  I said, it doesn't matter to me that you don't understand.  Oh, good for you.  Like, I don't, you don't have to, why do I have to go, oh, boy, I can't go home until  this guy understands why I won't take this packet.  I just don't want to waste my fucking time anymore.  I'm going to leave you not understanding why I didn't take that.  Figure it out yourself.  I'm going to let you have that as a life experience that you just don't know why. 
[03:13:00]  I'm an asshole.  The theme today is honesty from Louis C.K.  A lot of honesty coming from here.  It's just people think that everybody owes them what they want to hear.  You're going to hear some things you don't want to hear sometimes.  I lost a guy, he wanted to call, what was the guy's name that died?  Larry?  Look, we forgot already.  We forgot his fucking name.  It was Carl.  Jesus.  Wow.  Wow.  Who was that important guy? 
[03:13:30]  Oh, God.  He probably hopes it.  I was hoping that.  His last dying moments were probably, like, at least they'll have reverently speak of me.  Yeah.  Somebody wanted to call him a deadbeat father because he wanted a divorce from his wheel-bound  fucking wife.  Yeah, it doesn't sound so hot.  How much trouble could she have been?  Just lock up her wheels and go in the other room.  Yeah, chalk them up.  Give her a flat tire.  You're on your way. 
[03:14:00]  Walk away.  Josh in Maine.  Hit her, Josh.  Josh.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  You just got divorced last Friday and you want to talk to Louis.  He's not going to care you got divorced.  Yeah, sorry, man.  I'm probably, like, the happiest man in the whole frickin' United States right now.  Probably not.  See, what happened with me, I was one of these idiots that got married to the first girl from  high school and all of a sudden one day you wake up next to this, like, 230-pound fucking  sloth in bed beside you. 
[03:14:30]  And you're like, oh, my God.  Yes.  Again, who is?  Again, who is?  What's so great about you?  What's so awesome about you?  Like, we're all just cut, we're all just six-pack bellied.  We're all such beautiful guys.  Everybody should want to be with us.  Oh, right.  No, she got fat, really?  And you're just beautiful.  You're just awesome.  You're just awesome.  Full head of black hair and dark eyebrows and lantern jaw.  The whole single eyebrow. 
[03:15:00]  But I tell you what, man, friggin', I get a paycheck last Friday and I forgot what it  was like to have money.  So, it's like, I don't even know what to do with myself.  I took the week off from work to get all the divorce done and I'm like, I got money  in my pocket and I don't even know what the hell to do with myself now.  So, you're happy.  All right.  Good luck with that.  Sounds good, man.  All right, guys.  You take it easy.  I'm punching out.  All right.  Later.  It says, it said, divorce last Friday, you just want to shoot the shit with Lou.  You just want to shoot the shit with Lou. 
[03:15:30]  Shoot the shit.  Doesn't know Louie well.  I guess we shot.  You just want to shoot the shit with you, Lou.  Oh, that's great.  Two men.  Better than shooting Carl.  Enjoying their single lives.  That's the other thing I can't do is to bullshit talk.  How's it going?  Oh, pretty good.  It is hot out, huh?  Small talk.  Oh, fucking die.  Sigh for the heat, Hawk.  Everybody's got something to say, though.  That's something I learned from when you do stand-up.  Before, I could afford to rent a car and just shut out all of society and just, you know. 
[03:16:00]  Like, now I go rent a car.  Any city I'm in, even within three hours, I rent a car so I don't have to get driven  to the gig.  Yeah.  I picked up at the airport by some person.  But when I used to get picked up by some person who was asking me questions about whatever,  being on TV or whatever, it's so tedious.  But what I do now is I always ask them about their lives.  You just, whoever it is, you just go, where are you from?  You know, I'm in Winnipeg, Canada. 
[03:16:30]  And I get picked up by some woman.  And I'm like, so what's your story?  Where are you from?  There's always something.  Don't you just not want to talk sometimes?  Well, they're so surprised.  Because people love talking about themselves.  Sure.  Don't you just not want to talk, though, sometimes?  Well, then you just, you can shut them out.  Then they just run their mouth.  And you just have your own thoughts.  But occasionally they'll be like, oh, well, I live, I'm married, my husband has no legs.  What?  Wow.  All right, we can go run with that.  Yeah, I was hoping to talk about that.  Your husband can't, but we can. 
[03:17:00]  That's, like, sometimes I just don't want to fucking talk.  And I don't even want to, I don't even want to acknowledge by going like, yeah, yeah, yeah, I know.  No, that's more painful.  I get it.  Yeah, yeah.  Because then I'm gritting my teeth thinking, shut the fuck up.  I don't want to have to make believe I'm acknowledging you.  No.  And when you have kids, people want to have those conversations with your kids.  They walk up to your kid, hi, what are you doing?  She doesn't know you.  Get the fuck away from her. 
[03:17:30]  Punch someone in the balls.  Punch her in the pussy.  You hear that?  Hi.  Wait a minute.  What?  Yeah.  I'm going to have to hang out with people that I don't want to because of the kid thing,  right?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, fuck me.  That ain't going to be good.  Yeah, other people.  I don't care if my kid gets along with other kids that he thinks is cool or whatever.  No, but you've got to talk to the dad while they're hanging out with him.  How's that?  That's awful.  It is, right?  Yeah, it's awful.  No, because this conversation we're having, I've been able to avoid people I don't want  to be with or talk to.  That's what your Blackberry is for.  Do you have a Blackberry? 
[03:18:00]  Oh, yeah, I do.  You've got to have it with you at all the times.  And you just stare into it while your kid's playing with another kid.  So I'm going to have assholes in my life that I'm going to have to deal with.  Yeah, so you have to become an unapproachable asshole.  So just always be on the Blackberry.  So always be on the Blackberry.  So when they come to get their kid, what do I do?  When they come to get the kid?  Yeah.  This is down the road, I understand, but might as well get prepared now.  No, you know what?  I always trade taking care of somebody's kid for talking to them.  Like if my kid has a play date, if my kid has a friend they want to have, I'll have 
[03:18:30]  them over, the kid over, and I'll tell the parent, you go.  I'll take care of your kid.  You go have a day off.  What do you mean?  Well, that was in one of the episodes.  Yeah, I do it all the time.  I'll have two kids over.  Do the parents come over with the kid and hang out the whole time?  No, the parents go fuck off.  No, but I mean...  But you have to take care of another person's kid now.  Yeah, I have no problem with that.  But so what?  Yeah, I'll easily do that.  I should love nephews and nieces.  But I mean, there are times where the parent stays.  Oh, sure, that happens, yeah.  Yeah, that ain't happening.  I ain't talking to no fucking asshole because he's in the same class as my kid. 
[03:19:00]  You're going to have to get to know those people.  Tell me, you know, you do make friends that way.  Yeah, I could use a few friends, so that's fine.  Yeah, you'll like some of the people that you meet, and then there's other people you  won't like, and you and the other parents that you do like will shit on them.  It just never ends.  It becomes like a whole other thing.  Just the gossip never fucking ends.  No, it gets really vicious, too.  Really?  Yeah, there's people that are really mean to other people's...  Yeah?  ...other kids' parents, and it gets really gross. 
[03:19:30]  Really mean.  Fuck, I just had a realization.  I'm going to have to deal with people that I've avoided for many, many, many years.  Yes, Anthony, she's hot.  Have you tried that one yet?  No.  Is she an intern?  Yeah.  She's a Ron and Fez intern?  Got it.  Might as well stick around for Ron and Fez.  What's her name?  I think it starts with an S.  Thanks.  She's a Sam.  I mean, I was a Sam.  No, it's not Sam.  I would remember that name.  She's got a little bit of a pear shape going.  No, it's good.  A little bit of a pear shape. 
[03:20:00]  Come on.  That would look like Negan.  Her hair is a little blow-dried.  God, you guys are picky.  Wow.  I'm not saying I wouldn't fuck her.  I fucked a lot worse.  I fucked some really disgusting people.  Oh, shit.  Fucking Louie, man.  It was great seeing you, buddy.  Same here, man.  Louie C.K., his new show is called Louie.  It premieres next Tuesday.  We haven't talked about the show in the last hour, but I'm telling you, I saw the first 
[03:20:30]  four episodes.  A lot of people in Philly, all loving it.  It starts next Tuesday at 11 o'clock, right after Rescue Me on FX.  Please check it out and decide for yourself.  At least take a peek.  I think you're going to like it, though, man.  A lot of our audience definitely will.  Definitely will.  I think they'll like it.  Oh, hell yeah.  I think the Opie and Anthony listening people will like it.  And it says right here, the show revolves around Louie's hectic life as a successful  stand-up comedian and newly single father raising his two daughters.  Yeah.  So, some good stuff. 
[03:21:00]  Great language.  You get to see Louie's ass.  I got my ass in there once.  Were you, uh, um, the doctor's episode, which is going to do very well with Ricky Gervais,  when he's staring at your cock and just beating the shit out of you, and then brings the lady  in?  Were you standing there completely nude, or did you have some...  I had some...  Did you have a sock on or something?  Well, it's so...  The person who we had doing wardrobe then, she had a triangle of felt like, uh, you use  for women.  Right.  So she had...  We had to kind of call together like two or three of those, and she fucking glued them 
[03:21:30]  all over my dick.  It was a nightmare.  She didn't have a sock.  That's what you're supposed to have, put a sock on your dick.  But when you would be...  But no, I was covered up.  He couldn't...  I mean, I was probably not fun to look at.  But my point...  With what was showing.  Doing the funnel nudity thing, you would definitely do in front of Ricky Gervais.  You wouldn't give a shit, right?  Well, I wouldn't show him my cock, but...  Oh, you wouldn't?  Just for the goof?  I wouldn't want to show him my cock.  Well, you showed your cock on Lucky Louie?  Yeah, I kind of ran through a room with my dick out, yeah.  But I wouldn't want to stand there with my cock out in front of a man, no. 
[03:22:00]  That is a little much.  People that do that kind of thing are fucking gross to me.  No, yeah.  People that take out their dick and, like, rub it on their friend.  It's like, you're fucking being gay.  That really is the weirdest thing.  Like, the party pictures where you're teabagging your sleeping friend.  Yeah, that's your fucking gay.  It's like, why would you think that, because he's asleep, you should put your balls in  his mouth?  If he was awake, would you do that?  I was on a shuttle to Boston years ago, and Jay Moore happened to be on the plane. 
[03:22:30]  He was in his 20s then.  Like, early 20s.  He started pretty young.  Yeah.  And I'm sitting next to him on the plane, because we knew each other.  And he's sitting there in shorts.  And he looks down at his crotch, and he goes, if I take out my cock, will you spit on it?  Like, he just said that to be gross or whatever.  And I just decided in that moment, I don't like this guy.  I don't like him.  And I haven't...  And I know Jay, you know, and we're kind of friends, but I still go back to that moment.  And I'm like, that was fucking disgusting, and fuck him. 
[03:23:00]  Fucking fake faggot.  I just...  It makes me sick.  You know what?  I think we've all seen...  That's still Jay to me.  I can't help it.  And I have affection for him.  He's a nice guy.  We've all seen Jay's cock way too many times.  Jay is one of those guys who likes to take his dick out.  Yeah.  Keep your fucking penis hidden.  He'll pull it right out.  Birthday parties?  I'm not going to fucking birthday parties.  You've got to do all that shit.  Birthday parties, Lou.  What?  Birthday parties with the kids?  Yeah.  You've got to do all that.  What do you do there?  You know what?  When you get shut in in the house with the babies for long enough, you actually start appreciating 
[03:23:30]  that stuff.  Putting your kids in the middle with all the other kids, and then you hang out with the  parents.  Well, when you were growing up...  There's always one.  You walk around the house, the birthday party looking tense, and there'll be one guy who  probably you wouldn't have talked to in real life otherwise, but you're like,  in real life?  He's here.  A guy that...  I love talking to him.  Or a woman that's kind of haggard looking, but her tits are interesting, and she's got a sense  of humor, so you'll like talking to her. 
[03:24:00]  You'll start to see people that you're like, eh, kind of like her.  There's something about her.  She's fun.  She's fun to talk to.  But I know this is an easy bit, but when we were growing up, we had none of this shit.  Yeah, you just went outside the door.  Right.  I think the parents didn't show up at the parties and hang out while the kids were hanging out.  That is why it's harder for us.  There was a major separation.  Yeah.  Like you said, yeah, you opened the door and there was a whole life out there.  My mom, I was raised by a working mom, and in the morning, we would all get ready, and  she'd go to work, and we'd go to school.  Since I was in second grade, I would walk to school by myself. 
[03:24:30]  She would just be like, I'll see you when I get home after dinner.  Right.  Yeah, yeah.  And then I'd go to school, and then after school, it was up to me to figure out what to  do with myself.  And she just assumed you were all right.  Yeah, and then she'd come home from work, and she'd be like, oh, my kids are still around.  That's how shit happened.  That's the way it was like every day for my whole childhood.  And that's why a lot of kids got touched.  Yeah, no, it is.  There was a fucking child molester in my neighborhood.  Just waiting for mommy to go to work. 
[03:25:00]  Yeah.  There was a guy named Jean Baptiste who used to drive around in a pinto, and every kid  I knew except for me, and I used to honestly feel a little unattractive that he never hit  on me.  You want at least to be hit on me.  He'd take you to, when you hit around teenage years, Jean Baptiste would take you to lunch,  and then he'd put his hand on your leg, and every kid had a different toleration point  of how long he'd let him put his hand on his leg.  You should have said, if I pull my cock out where you spit on it, it might have turned  him off. 
[03:25:30]  Exactly.  Now the kids just don't want to.  But now you're responsible for every moment of their lives.  Now you've got to take them through everything.  Remember your mom would just drop you off, and then go, all right, call me when you need  a ride.  Yeah.  That's how we all grew up, right?  That's the way it was.  But now, no, I have kids over my house, or I take my kid to their house.  And I can't imagine a day where my daughter just walks, just leaves the house unattended.  I can't imagine it.  I don't know how to process that.  That's going to fuck you up.  Yeah.  I remember taking those bike rides with your friends. 
[03:26:00]  And every so often, you'd be like, let's take a real long fucking bike ride, and you'd  go like, yeah, a couple of towns over, instead of your normal, just riding your bike around  the block shit.  You'd go to the woods and find a dead cat or something, or something weird.  Yeah, poke it with a stick for a while.  A retarded girl who shows her bush to people, or whatever.  Yes.  That's the way it was.  I was growing up back then when Paris left you alone.  Why does everyone know a retarded girl that used to show her bush?  Yeah.  You know how many times that has come up on this show? 
[03:26:30]  I love doing that, I guess.  I don't know.  No, it's the way it was.  Now, people want to talk about kid parties.  They want to warn me about Little League and all this other shit.  Look, man, I'm only six weeks in.  No, it's a while.  I'm good for now.  Louie, thank you, brother.  Sure, man.  We'll be right back with more Best of O&A.  Stay there.

[03:31:30]  I'm glad SiriusXM is taking care of the very important issues that face us every day here, Anthony.  Yeah, I know.  Thank God.  I was talking about Pop-Tarts.  Yep.  So I was thinking, you know what?  Today's the day where I need some nice toasted Pop-Tarts.  Yummy.  I go brown sugar cinnamon, Anthony, without the frosting.  Wonderful.  That's my Pop-Tart of choice.  Everyone has their Pop-Tart of choice.  And I was informed by Kenny, who usually does these ridiculous tasks for the show, 
[03:32:00]  that I can't have any toasted Pop-Tarts anymore.  Now, what is the problem with a toasted Pop-Tart?  I've been having toasted Pop-Tarts.  We've been in this building, what, well over a year now, I guess?  A year and three months, maybe, something like that.  Are they afraid the talent might burn their tongues and not be able to broadcast?  Is that what it is?  It's got to be something reasonable.  Steve, what is going on with my toasted Pop-Tarts? 
[03:32:30]  I was informed last week by our head of security for the company that the toaster oven that we have in place in the hall that toasts your Pop-Tarts is a fire hazard and can't be plugged in there anymore.  Fire hazard?  People think way too fucking hard.  Do these buildings catch on fire at all anymore?  Well, how about this?  Glass building.  The odd chance that it starts to fire, first of all, how hard of a fire is that to put out?  What, all of a sudden toasted Pop-Tarts is going to set the whole building ablaze? 
[03:33:00]  That's it.  Leave.  Let it just catch everything.  People have to just do shit to justify their jobs.  That's what I'm thinking.  We've been toasting Pop-Tarts here for 15 months with not one issue.  I don't even think we had a little smoke coming from the toaster and where maybe a piece of the Pop-Tart broke off.  And you know how that burns up at the bottom of the toaster?  Oh, it smokes like crazy.  I don't even think we had that incident in 15 fucking months.  Because everything smelled delicious.  So what?  We had to get rid of our toaster?  Well, it's not gotten rid of. 
[03:33:30]  It's just in the office now.  Not plugged in and not functional.  Well, you might as well throw it out the fucking window.  What good is it if we can't plug it in?  That could hurt somebody.  What is this place doing?  The Pop-Tart toaster is the problem.  Can I make this announcement again?  We have the easiest fucking jobs in the world.  Stop trying to make them harder.  This is the easiest fucking job.  Stop trying to make it so fucking complicated.  Yesterday, Jimmy wants a little Wi-Fi.  It turns out there's a whole fucking thing that they do with their Wi-Fi here. 
[03:34:00]  Right.  Which may be fixed now.  We'll see.  Maybe fixed.  Maybe that one will be fixed.  I want to know workplace toaster fire stats.  Because it can't really be that high.  There actually was a fire.  It was actually within two blocks of here.  It was in 1977.  Somebody was taking a bath and they plugged in their toaster and there was a fire.  Yes.  I remember that.  Tragic.  You know how ridiculous that is that we can't toast Pop-Tarts in the morning now to make 
[03:34:30]  our jobs just a little easier?  And the delicious wafting smell of a toasted Pop-Tart fills the room with joy.  It just makes everyone a little happier.  Yes.  A little happier.  I'll see if there's an alternate location that we can plug said toaster into.  Yeah.  Where's the asbestos room?  You know what?  Follow this through.  Where's the misothelioma suite that we can plug this fucking thing in?  I think what happens in workplaces is you hire people and then they realize their job means  nothing.  Yeah.  So then they have to justify their job. 
[03:35:00]  You know someone like this at your workplace.  Yeah.  So all of a sudden they go, all they do is walk around looking for something that could  maybe be a problem one time in the next hundred years.  Do you think he jotted down on his log sheet, got rid of toaster fire hazard at 8.05.  Probably.  Made sure that.  Probably.  Unbelievable.  Usually these things, given who told me this and given how often he's seen that thing,  probably somebody else complained.  I'll guarantee it.  And that's why he didn't say it.  Who was the douchebag that complained?  That's what I would like to know. 
[03:35:30]  Again, as it is with corporations, and this is all of them, nobody just says anything.  Right.  They snivel.  We've been trained in a country to be worms.  Like everyone goes behind each other's back.  Here, they have a toaster plugged in.  Could you go talk to them?  Right.  It's just a culture of worms.  Find out who complained about it.  You'll never find out, dude.  I don't think I'll find out.  You'll never find out.  The guy who told me it was a fire hazard has never, ever, ever been.  It's not a fire hazard.  It's a toaster.  It ain't security. 
[03:36:00]  He don't care.  Believe me.  He was a toaster.  Tell me how that's a fire hazard.  I have no idea.  A toaster in 2010 is not going to fucking start a fire.  You could burn the fuck out of the Pop-Tart.  And guess what?  It's not going to start a fire on this floor.  It might get a little smoky for a couple seconds.  A circuit breaker would blow.  It might get smoky.  Yeah.  It's not going to burst into flames.  What the fuck is it?  An old cloth cord from 1950?  Right.  That's going to short circuit?  And then you get assholes like this.  Go ahead, Paul. 
[03:36:30]  Go ahead.  Make your stupid point.  I find it funny that I have to work on a roof in 100-degree weather, and your job's hard  when you can't post a pop-Tart.  Hey, asshole.  I said we have the easiest jobs in the world.  Did you hear that part?  Did you hear that part?  I said that.  I love you.  All right.  Fall off the roof.  Fall off the roof!  Thank you, Anthony, for sticking up for me for once.  I really appreciate it.  I really appreciate it.  It's kind of nice to be on the same team again.  Thank you.  My God.  No, I'm talking about, we all deal with this shit. 
[03:37:00]  Yeah.  Corporations and how they're ruining your easy fucking job.  Man!  Don't make us do the whole bit.  And all the stuff you're not allowed to do in your goddamn cubicles anymore.  Yeah.  Bullshit.  All we want is a tasty Pop-Tart every once in a while, and someone had to find a problem  with that.  Do you get it?  Do you know how nice it is?  You got that at your workplace.  Just have a Pop-Tart?  How is that a problem?  I would love for the guy to come in here and explain that to me. 
[03:37:30]  Would he?  And I like the guy.  I think I know which one it is.  Maybe he's got fucking some kind of in at the Pop-Tart store going into Times Square  and doesn't want you fucking scabbing out your own Pop-Tarts here.  Is that today?  You've got to go down there and get your own fucking Pop-Tart.  Today's Tuesday.  Meaning today, Tuesday, or next Tuesday?  Today.  Oh, I'm sorry, Jimmy.  Is it opening up today?  The Pop-Tart store opens today.  Where is it exactly?  I'm going to get a Pop-Tart.  It's 42nd and 7th.  The question is, what time does it open, though, Ant? 
[03:38:00]  That is the question.  Yes, it is.  You get a selection of Pop-Tarts.  Because I want one, too.  I want, yeah, a selection.  Oh, by the way, Ant, they sell Pop-Tarts, thank you, in the vending machine.  Guess what?  You have to toast Pop-Tarts.  Yeah, they taste a little cardboardy.  Cardboardy, if you don't toast them.  Right out of the package.  Yes, yes, yes.  I don't think they're fully cooked.  No, you've got to finish the cooking process of the tart.  Pop-Tarts are wonderful.  Oh, we're not allowed to have them anymore, Jimmy.  They pop their tarts.  They're a fire hazard, do you?  You don't know that? 
[03:38:30]  So now they're just tarts, because they pop out of the toaster.  Right.  So they're just saying, you can only have a tart.  Right.  No popping involved.  Right.  Pop tarts.  Pop tarts.  And you sell them here.  You pop it in the fucking toaster.  I think I've got a lawsuit.  I think you do.  I really do.  I think I've got some kind of workplace lawsuit.  But do you understand, this is why.  It's like little things like this.  Now, I don't want to take it out of context here.  But this is why people go ballistic.  It's not Pop-Tarts with Dave Mustaine.  It's the ridiculousness of the workplace.  Workplace.  Workplace. 
[03:39:00]  I hate that term.  Wormplace.  But the work environment has become such a fucking culture of, no, you can't do that.  You're going to get in trouble.  Right.  It's fucking in rape.  Any individuality, anything that you're just going to do for yourself is frowned upon.  Not allowed.  Thank you.  That's why I want to bring this up.  Be part of the collective.  Guess what?  I'll survive without a fucking Pop-Tart, but it's a bigger issue.  I've been watching this shit happen in radio for a long fucking time, and it's getting  completely ridiculous that now they're taking toasters out of a lousy glass office, by 
[03:39:30]  the way.  Yeah.  It's glass.  A glass fucking office, because someone feels like they got to justify their job.  It's not a fire hazard.  I don't agree with that in the workplace.  I don't agree with that in the workplace.  Right, right.  Thank you, Jimmy.  Thank you.  Thank you, Gervais.  It's great.  It's all they're built on is saying no, no.  Yeah.  And I'm going to tell you something.  Why are we trying to make each other so goddamn miserable?  Most people's jobs, including ours, you can do in half the fucking time, okay? 
[03:40:00]  So people have a lot of time to kill at work, and now you make them miserable.  That time, that killing of time, they would check their fucking Facebooks, you're not  allowed to really check their Facebooks at work anymore.  You would pinch a hiney of a broad walking by.  You know how many man hours are being lost?  Man hours in the workplace?  No man hours are being lost.  Most people can do their jobs in half the fucking time, but someone feels like, well,  if I'm going to pay you such and such, you better be here from nine to five.  Why if the guy can do his job at four hours? 
[03:40:30]  Why does he have to be there from nine to five?  Find something else to do.  It's because everyone is emasculated, and the women too.  Everybody has no power over anything.  Everybody is a completely powerless nothing.  So what they do is, in the little places they're allowed to exercise power, they do.  The offices have become patrolled by a bunch of people who are traffic cops, wannabes.  They want to have some kind of influence, and they don't know when to say, yeah, it's  all right.  They never know when to say, you know what, that's all right. 
[03:41:00]  You know what I ask all the time?  I ask, is it good for the company?  That's what I ask.  Is it good for the company?  Not the office, though.  Right?  Where is it?  Office space.  Even yesterday, when I went out for that guitar, right, coming back in, the guy at  the lobby, like the security guy, had to let me know that what I was carrying was considered  freight, but he was going to give me a free pass this time.  What a guy.  A guitar, right?  Isn't he a great guy? 
[03:41:30]  Because he needed to be able to exercise that power, because that's the only power that  he has.  So he had to exercise it.  Remember our old building, if you're walking out with a big box of your own fucking stuff,  that was a major problem?  Freight.  And they wouldn't allow you to walk past the fucking security guy with a box of your  own shit?  Gotta be the freight elevator.  That is why people, like again, we're getting to this flight attendant, but it's like what  happens is you just, so much, that's what happens.  A lot of people snap with a gun, a lot of people don't snap violently, they just yell and 
[03:42:00]  scream and walk out.  But, you know, you get told no constantly by people who really love telling you no, and  they won't admit they love telling you no, because they're just fucking pussies.  Yeah.  It's so irritating.  So, I know when someone's telling me no because they have to, and when they're enjoying it,  and when they want it.  You know the difference.  Most of the time they do it because they're enjoying it.  They're on a little power trip.  But, can't post Pop-Tars.  That's, it's, yeah.  Like that guy, like he didn't have to say, like if he was going to let me through, he just 
[03:42:30]  didn't even have to say it.  He could have just let me through.  No, no, exactly.  But he had to let me know.  He's doing you a favor, Danny.  Sure.  Now you owe him something.  Yes, he let you through, so he doesn't have to say anything.  He just could have just let you through, but he had to say, by the way, that's considered  freight, but I'm going to be a good guy.  God forbid you forget your security badge around here.  Ideas.  I look at the guy, you see me every fucking day, obviously.  Those guys in the morning are the worst.  Obviously, it's five in the morning, no one's thinking straight. 
[03:43:00]  I forgot my badge at home, and then you have to go through this whole thing.  They got to sign you in, and it's unbelievable.  I just say good morning, and then I beep my badge, and I walk through.  No, I'm saying if you forget your badge.  Oh.  Don't forget your badge.  No, no.  It's always on my badge.  You'll be late for the show, because it takes a good 15 or 20 minutes to get in the system,  even though they see you every fucking day.  Oh, fuck that.  Instead of just saying, okay, I see you every day.  Obviously, you're not fired.  You just forgot your badge at home.  No problem.  Make sure you have it tomorrow.  That's the end of conversation. 
[03:43:30]  Never.  Where's Kenny?  I want to know more about the toaster.  Kenny's a security guy.  I want to see what this is all about.  Kenny, please speak freely, because we're asking you to for the radio show.  Kenny, there's a great toaster controversy going on.  Yeah, what do you know about this?  What do you know?  What's the word on the street?  What's the word in the fucking lunchroom?  I only have second-hand information, because I was told by the executive producer the toaster dilemma.  Yeah, I'll let it be known that he gets half his shit wrong.  Where is he?  Did Steve talk on the air yet or no? 
[03:44:00]  Yeah, he did, Jimmy.  How funny is that?  Jimmy doesn't even know.  He was right next to you talking about the toaster thing.  Five minutes ago.  He could have been murdered two feet away from you.  I'm sorry.  Dude, that is fantastic, because what he said,  was that unimportant.  I don't know why, but I feel rage, and I felt rage  since Danny started talking about his situation.  I'm so fucking angry, and none of this affects me. 
[03:44:30]  I'm reading this thing about Islam.  It's none of my fucking business.  I don't deal with these savages fucking beating and shooting women in the head for being pregnant.  I didn't get shot down for a fucking thing, but I'm so angry at it.  All right, hold on.  I hear you.  The phones are lit.  Kenny's standing by.  Matt in Ohio.  I don't want to lose Matt's thought on this.  Go ahead, Matt.  Hey, guys.  I just wanted to agree with Jimmy when he said,  we live in a world of worms, or whatever he said, or offices are full of worms.  It's like that Glen Gary Glen Ross quote. 
[03:45:00]  I think it was Al Pacino said,  Yeah!  Yeah!  I can't see over my desk.  What did he say?  Yeah, what did he say?  Ricky Roma.  We are not in a world of men.  I see that all the time.  I work in a little office, and people bitch to me about stuff.  It's like, well, you're two doors down from this guy that's pissing you off.  Just go down there and be a man about it.  Be a man.  Say something.  They have made the workplace just a miserable fucking place to go every day.  Just a bunch of complainers and whiners, people who are offended, who like to say no, 
[03:45:30]  people who aren't getting fucked properly at home.  That's what the problem with a lot of women in the workplace is.  Not all of them, but a lot of women at the workplace would probably be a lot nicer  if they got fucked properly when they got home.  Absolutely.  But they're not getting fucked properly.  I would love to know the odds of a toaster actually catching fire to a point, even to  the point where it would be a major problem.  I actually know the odds.  I would love to fucking know.  One in 2,408,000. 
[03:46:00]  Great line, but I bet you it's close to that, Jimmy.  I bet you it's close to that.  You know what the problem is, though, about being a man and walking down the hall and confronting  somebody?  It's not that world anymore.  You're dealing with a collective.  If you approach somebody, they will pass the buck and say, well, it's this policy and  that.  And then it gets blown off to some fucking spiritual upstairs collective of a board that you can't 
[03:46:30]  talk to.  There's no one person to talk to anymore.  They say it's, well, it's policy.  Well, who made the policy?  Can I talk to them?  No, they're not even here.  They don't.  And then, like Danny said, yeah, you just wrote that down.  If you do say something, then you're considered difficult.  You can't approach a person anymore and say, look, you have a problem with this.  I have a problem with what you're saying.  Let's fucking talk it out.  They've made it so that you're not allowed to disagree.  No, you can't. 
[03:47:00]  You're not allowed to.  It's whatever it is.  You think we're considered difficult?  Yes.  And it's not even just here.  Believe me.  I'm not just putting this on us.  No.  And serious.  This is everywhere everyone works.  That's why I like bringing this shit up.  In the end, I don't give a shit if I don't get a fucking toasted Pop-Tart.  Trust me.  I don't care.  Yeah, whatever.  But it just amazes me that someone had to go out of their fucking way to take our toaster  away.  Instead of what you do as a real man, you walk by and maybe go, hey, I noticed you guys  got a toaster in your office. 
[03:47:30]  Just be careful with that.  Oh, yeah.  No problem.  That's how it used to work.  Remember?  Yeah.  And you'd acknowledge, like, okay, yeah, I see you have a job to do.  No problem.  And that's it.  That's the end of it.  I was just thinking you were saying that.  That's how it used to work.  All I thought was, until the fire.  Until the fire.  Did we cause a fire once?  Until the fire.  That would be great.  It doesn't work that way anymore.  They all died in a fire.  Let me say hi to Pete in Florida. 
[03:48:00]  Pete.  Jimmy.  Hey, good morning, guys.  Hey.  Absolutely, fucking people.  My boss won't even let me have a damn small four-cup fucking coffee maker in my cubicle  because it takes up too much power.  Yeah.  Too much power.  This is the shit that's going on.  I'm so glad this came up today.  Too much power.  And that just makes you a little more miserable every day.  You know what I mean?  You can make coffee if you have power.  I think we had a too much power thing, too, because, like, for some reason,  I guess, like, Monster Energy, like, sponsors Steve because they give him, like, T-shirts 
[03:48:30]  and, like, Casey.  Yes.  They give him the shitty DVDs from A&E.  Wait, are you sure it's Monster or Put Out?  No.  There's this mini fridge that's just sitting there unplugged because he's not allowed to  plug it in.  That's what I put my lunch in.  I can't plug it in.  As much as it's fun to beat the shit out of Steve, why can't he plug a fridge?  Exactly.  Why can't he make some money on the side that no one else knows about and he plug it in?  Why can't he plug his fridge in? 
[03:49:00]  I don't know.  It doesn't make sense to me.  Like, 300 radio stations broadcast out of this facility, but there's not enough electricity  for his mini fridge.  Are you going to keep A&E into this dumb studio for 10 hours and no one's even in here?  We've got to turn up the heat just to get the temperature right every morning?  Are you shitting a refrigerator?  Don't even get on the air conditioning.  We've got some damn bitch that sits next to me in the next cube.  It's too cold!  Sorry, it's not like 8,000 freaking degrees.  All right, guys, punch it out.  All right, man.  Yeah, it's just amazing what is happening. 
[03:49:30]  Oh, here, listen to this one.  Mikey, go ahead, Mikey.  Mike!  What's up, fellas?  Hey, brother.  The latest thing that will make you nuts is I work for a company.  We make deliveries with trucks, so GPSs have been installed in all the trucks.  Yeah.  One of the owners now, his job now is to sit in his office on a computer screen and say,  this guy's taking too long to get here.  He stopped here too long.  Why is he still here?  Because all the names, the guy's names with the truck, how fast they're going, 
[03:50:00]  where they stopped, everything is on his computer screen, and now that is his full-time job  to just fuck all the drivers.  You know what, though?  I can't even fucking get against it.  That's as far as something with insurance and fucking insurance.  What do you mean insurance?  It's their company, and they don't want accidents happening.  But if the guy is fucking, no, no, you're thinking like a lawyer.  This is what lawyers do.  If the guy is a reckless employee, just get rid of him.  He wants more efficiency.  You don't monitor the guy's every fucking move. 
[03:50:30]  Well, he wants more efficiency out of his employees.  That's why that guy's doing that, right, sir?  Yeah, but the problem is they survive, you know, companies have survived forever without  this.  Exactly.  And you know what, when you listen to the guy sitting in his office, it's a personal  thing.  Why is he stopping?  He doesn't give a shit about any of the insurance.  All right, that shit is bullshit, but if he sees that you're doing fucking 85 miles  an hour in the company truck, that's probably a problem.  And believe me, not to be fucking Billy boss worshiper, but if you're an employee...  You guys are missing the point, I think. 
[03:51:00]  Go ahead.  I think if you're an employer, you have the right to know, if you've got a delivery guy,  where he is, and how he's making his deliveries.  There's lines.  It's always put into place, seeming like they're doing the right thing, but I guarantee this  fucking asshole is beating the shit out of him because he's three miles over the speed  limit.  I don't doubt it.  And stopped at a fucking Dunkin' Donuts to get a cup of coffee.  Why'd you stop at fucking Dunkin' Donuts?  There's a line, though.  There's a line between...  But that's the problem is what I want to get into.  They always take it too fucking far. 
[03:51:30]  You're right.  Right.  But there is a line...  I understand why they would put something like this in place.  Sorry, Ed.  There is a line, though.  No, that, all right, this is okay.  This isn't.  You don't just wipe everything out.  Right.  Nothing's okay.  That's our company policy.  We're dealing with the same thing with a fucking toaster.  Stupid toaster, exactly.  If we had a fucking flamethrower in there...  Right.  ...I can understand them having a problem.  Right.  It's a toaster.  On paper, I say, well, all right, you've got to make sure there's no fire hazards around  the fucking workplace, of course. 
[03:52:00]  But we're talking about a fucking toaster that toasts Pop-Tarts.  Was it under kindling wood?  Sounds like you got a new fit with that flamethrower with the Pop-Tarts, you know?  What's that, sir?  You sound like...  I heard you.  I can't believe you walked into that.  My point is that a lot of this stuff is put in place with good intentions.  I get that.  I get why employers do that.  But then you got the douchebags that are running the new technology that have to do the power  trip thing that you mentioned, Jimmy.  It drives me nuts.  And take it way too fucking far. 
[03:52:30]  This guy got written up because he had the wrong shoes at work.  How do you get written up for not having the right shoes?  He's everything injured.  Neil Armstrong, you're on the air.  All right.  That would be plausible.  Steve in Vegas, Steve.  I had the wrong shoes.  They didn't match my purse.  I'm not allowed to wear high heels.  Yes.  I was wearing the wrong colored shoes after Labor Day.  Labor Day has nothing to do with me.  I put forth no labor.  Although I look like I'm going into it. 
[03:53:00]  Steve in Vegas.  Sorry, Steve.  What did he do to you?  A lot of labor jokes.  You got lazy, fat, and gay all in one fucking swap.  Steve, go ahead.  All right.  I've been working for this company for about two years.  I'm a good employee.  I was in a rush one day.  I left the house wearing the wrong kind of shoes.  I got to work.  I had, just like an office space, four managers come up to me, tell me what I did wrong. 
[03:53:30]  At the end of the day, I had a write-up waiting for me.  Now, why did you forget your shoes?  And what do you do where the shoes matter?  I'm a bartender.  I was just in a rush that morning.  I accidentally put on my sneakers as opposed to my work shoes.  And it's so who cares.  That's one of those fucking things that obviously happens.  Who cares?  The guys had to go out of their way to bust your fucking balls.  Is someone going to sit at that bar and look at your sneakers and get up and go,  I'm not drinking here?  No, we look at cleavage. 
[03:54:00]  Do they have nice cleavage?  Yeah, what are you doing tending bar anyway?  There should be a hot girl.  Fuck you when you're cocked.  Do you bartend at a gay bar?  No, if I did, I'd be making much more money, though.  Oh, sexy.  All right, brother.  Let's go to Steve in Jersey.  Steve.  Yeah.  How you doing?  Oh, we got a Mythbusters thing coming up.  This is a good topic right now.  Let's keep with this.  Steve, go.  Yeah, I got a boss at a company where I used to work who created all the policies, a small 
[03:54:30]  company.  And then he would quote when, for instance, you had to take your vacation day as a week,  not individual days.  And I'd say, well, why?  Oh, it's company policy.  I said, you are the company.  You can change this.  You're the company.  Nope, it's company policy.  Is there anything worse than hearing, ah, I'm sorry, that's company policy.  And that's that vague thing you were talking about, Anthony.  There's no, you can't confront company policy.  You can't, right.  It's because the guy who made it doesn't want to have a discussion. 
[03:55:00]  It's like, it's not.  Because most of them are dummies.  Most of them are dummies.  Yeah.  They're not, their logic is terrible.  So if you sit down with them and you go, what about this and this?  And you don't even have to yell at them.  They'd fall apart.  Right.  Because they're morons.  Right.  Right.  And instead of being made to look stupid, then you go out to company policy.  Company policy, un-fucking-negotiable.  Now, we're going to get back to our toaster, but first, Eric has a little Mythbusters observation.  Eric in Georgia.  Hey, good morning, guys.  You guys are missing the point.  No, I'm just kidding.  Oh, damn it.  Hey, I was thinking about this. 
[03:55:30]  That was a horrible just kidding.  And I was watching Mythbusters this weekend, and they were out in the desert shooting a propane  cylinder with a .30-06 and couldn't get a flame.  Yeah, they couldn't get a flame.  And we can't toast pop-tarts.  Toast pop-tarts.  Because that's a fire hazard.  And when you want to stay online, of course, that doesn't get fixed.  Anyone know who's asking about the Wi-Fi update?  Yes, yes.  What?  What happens?  Boom it again.  Jimmy got the new codes to put in so he could stay on the network. 
[03:56:00]  No new codes.  Oh, well, whatever it was.  I think they should have fixed something.  Yeah, they should have fixed something.  And you got knocked off again, did you?  Yeah.  Yeah, thanks.  Yeah.  Why wouldn't I?  Let's go to Alex in Brooklyn.  Alex.  Alex.  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Hey, Alex.  Yeah, I had a place I used to work at.  And they used to be real, real nauseous about time.  You'd get in the morning, and you'd have to walk straight to your desk.  You couldn't even go to the kitchen and get any coffee. 
[03:56:30]  And, like, for example, when you had to go to the bathroom, we had this little application.  You actually had to time your login.  And actually, one time, I came to work with a really upset stomach.  And I took a long time in the bathroom.  My health desk manager actually came to me and was like, hey, spent a little bit of time there in the bathroom.  You know, what was going on?  He started answering.  I met my fucking shit.  So, you know, after a while, I was just like, fuck this place.  I ended up putting it in anyway.  What kind of job is that?  Where they're keeping track of how long you're in the bathroom? 
[03:57:00]  In a toity.  He made German film.  I basically answered phone calls and helped people with their computers.  Yeah, there used to be a big problem if you walked into the bathroom at this place I worked with a newspaper.  They were fucking like, they'd look for you.  Because they knew you were going to spend more time taking a shit if you had a newspaper.  Because you're going to, you know, peruse the stories.  Right.  They want you in and out.  Right.  Listen to what happened to this fucking guy. 
[03:57:30]  We're almost done, I guess.  Ray in New York.  Ray.  Oh, you can come in, Ray.  Right.  But you brought it up.  I know.  Okay.  I get mad at myself.  Right, Anthony.  Shut up.  You didn't have to get mad there.  You just didn't.  If you didn't bring it up, you wouldn't be mad at yourself.  It's very confusing.  I know.  Right.  I'm an idiot.  Right.  I was at work the other day, and my girlfriend just got into an accident.  She texted me, letting me know. 
[03:58:00]  Is she okay?  Yeah, she was okay.  What happened?  Where'd the whore hit?  She was kind of a defendant.  It was some black lady.  She drove off, hit and run.  Oh, no.  So I was at work, and I called her.  I was making sure she was okay.  And my boss sees me, and he just gives me this dirty look.  And so then the next day, he calls me up to his office, and he's like, all right, there's  a no phone policy here.  I'm going to have to write you up. 
[03:58:30]  And yeah, I got written up.  It was bullshit.  You told him your girlfriend had an accident?  What?  Did you tell him that your girlfriend got in an accident and he didn't care?  I told him that.  That's just horse shit.  I know.  That's just horse shit.  But as a boss, you realize, okay, obviously, you know, I want to make sure his fucking  loved one wasn't beheaded in a goddamn car accident.  Extenuating sense.  All right.  Well, Kenny, back to you.  The toaster.  What have you heard by secondhand information?  I have really nothing to add to the story. 
[03:59:00]  All right.  But one side note.  Remember that thought.  That rules.  One side note.  I was once told by a company executive not to stir things up on the air.  Stir things up.  It's our radio show.  Wait.  Someone told me.  This is why I can't work with those guys.  They don't even understand how a radio show works.  Someone told you not to stir things up?  Or do they say on the air?  Yes.  On the air.  They said, come see that executive. 
[03:59:30]  And they'll take care of things.  Don't stir things up on the air.  People love this shit.  All right.  So if you're fucking up and we bring it to everyone else's attention on our show, they  love it.  Wow.  Because they can relate to that.  That's mind-boggling.  It really is mind-boggling.  They actually told you not to stir shit up on the air.  Yes.  And I'm a good company man.  About stuff that's going on around here.  I'm a good company man.  I want my contract renewed in two months.  You're a good company man.  Yes. 
[04:00:00]  You're a regular good man.  Yes.  Do you realize bringing up the toaster thing just gave us a half-hour radio and then all  these people out there are relating to the horseshit thing?  Yeah, but you should take care of that behind the scenes.  Are you fucking kidding me?  This is why I could have just...  You don't have the skill set.  Politely, I will say, hi, thank you.  Can you burn the latest fucking Silver Sun pickup CD for me?  Thank you.  Have a nice day.  That's the relationship I want with you.  Because you guys don't get this.  I don't even know who you're talking about.  I know exactly who he's talking about. 
[04:00:30]  That's annoying.  That someone would tell you how to behave on the air?  Don't stir shit up on the air.  It's about giving an interesting radio show.  How about we tell you how to act in your office?  Don't sit there.  Don't be so harsh, man.  That's what I'm saying.  Don't sit in that chair.  Move it.  Move your desk.  If we don't stir shit up on the air, we have no radio show.  Look at the phones.  Everyone deals with this shit at work.  They're lit.  Everyone deals with this.  They're lit. 
[04:01:00]  Wow.  I know somebody...  If you're that sensitive, you shouldn't be working for this channel.  Work for a music channel.  They're not going to fucking beat you up for being someone that might not have a skill set  for this type of fucking format.  I know somebody in a past life at another job that used to walk around the precinct with  papers in their hands just to look like he was doing something.  Of course.  Was that called Kenny?  Oh, I don't know. 
[04:01:30]  I don't know.  Don't stir shit up on the air.  That, to me...  I don't know how to respond to that.  Yeah, no kidding.  It's enraged.  It should be this.  Every little thing that you can stir up, bring to the air.  That's the advice.  See, if you're that sensitive and insecure, you should have never agreed to work with the  Opie and Anthony show.  I was only making a point.  Do you do your fucking research before you say yes to a job offer? 
[04:02:00]  Ridiculous.  Look at the phones.  I know.  You just stirred shit up.  Because people are constantly dealing with this.  You dumb fucks!  They're constantly dealing with this.  Just burn me the illegal CDs!  That's what you should be doing every fucking day.  Burn the illegal CDs, not Pop-Tarts.  Leave the fucking creativity to us, you stupid fuck.  That's how you respond to that, Jimmy. 
[04:02:30]  It's mind-boggling.  It really is irritating.  This shit is brought up because everyone...  See, we're a show that relates to the people.  Exactly.  If it's happening to us, guess what?  It's happening to other people out there.  And they go, holy shit, my boss is an asshole, too.  We do relate to them.  Why don't you put one of these little filthy peasants on the air?  Let me hear his story of trials.  Let me hear his trifling life story.  Go, boy!  Entertain me with your misery.  Yes.  Say, look, works with an asshole at work. 
[04:03:00]  It's just people relating.  Oh, that's me.  I just typed that in.  Oh.  Don't say that on the air.  Talk about it off the air.  Quietly.  Wow.  And what were you bringing up on the air?  This was like a very long time ago.  Oh, it's a long time ago.  All right.  They should have said talk better on the air.  They got to him, though.  They got to him, see?  And this is what ends up happening, too.  They end up getting to you after a while. 
[04:03:30]  Fucking Mopey McGillicott.  Now he's nervous that if he says something, he could be in trouble.  But it was a long time ago.  Yeah.  What did you stir up?  I mentioned something about...  I can't remember.  Yeah.  Because there's so many issues.  Day in and day out.  Ah, shit.  I'm fucking kidding.  How about these idiots down the hall get my fucking toaster back? 
[04:04:00]  Prove your worth.  I want fucking Pop-Tarts every morning.  Yeah.  Don't shock they let us have a refrigerator.  No, it's not plugged in, remember?  Oh, thank you.  Kevin from Connecticut.  You guys have been stirring shit up since 1996.  Actually goes way before that.  Yeah.  I think we started stirring up shit around 1995.  And it's worked very well for us and the popularity of this radio show.  You dopes.  Yeah.  Guess what?  Leave us alone. 
[04:04:30]  Guess what?  You work for the O.P. and Anthony show.  You're going to get a beating every once in a while.  Yeah.  Just that.  What, you're going to be the first one that doesn't get a beating?  That ain't happening.  I'd rather walk than fucking play by that stupid rule where we don't stir shit up on  the air.  Talk to some of the veterans of this show.  The ones we've left in our wake.  That'll give you a little understanding of how easy you have it.  I love the guys we see that they make believe they don't even know us.  We're like, dude, we worked together for three years.  Remember?  We barely get a nod now.  We all got thrown out the fucking door the same day. 
[04:05:00]  Hey, I would argue it made someone's career much better.  Yeah.  Uh-huh.  So don't be that bitter toward us.  It's the O.P. and Anthony show's best of O&A.  We'll be right back.  Don't go anywhere.  Ideas come when people of different backgrounds get together.  I'm Perry Peltz.

[04:09:30]  They said, thank God, thank God you have a mixed crowd.  Meaning white people came because they fucking hate black shows.  Wow.  So they saw some white people there.  They were like, thank God.  We're going to make some money.  Oh, we're going to make a few bucks.  And then they went to say, look, it's not even the guys.  Because guys, we're just easy going.  Guys will fucking just want life to be good.  It's the women, all women.  But black women get weird. 
[04:10:00]  I asked for 17 french fries.  You only brought me 13.  You'd be like, oh, come on, bitch.  I got bad service.  I'm not tipping.  I got to ask you a really dumb question.  Go ahead.  Do black guys drink like white guys at comedy shows?  You get the white guys at the comedy shows.  No, nobody drinks like white people do.  White people are fucking.  There is a difference, right?  Yeah.  Black guys don't sip.  White people guzzle.  There is a difference, right?  Yeah.  I mean, black people.  So if a comedy club sees a lot of white guys coming in, they know they're going to make 
[04:10:30]  some cash off the bar.  But black people drink.  When they go out.  What kind of drinking does a black guy do?  At a comedy club.  Sips drinks a lot, drinks a lot of Heineken and drinks a lot of Hennessy and Coke.  Do you know what I mean?  And the women drink a lot of girly drinks.  So the women ultimately drink a little more than the guys.  But guys drink a lot and they drink top shelf.  When black people go out, they try to, you know, treat themselves very nice.  White people drink shots and they get drunk. 
[04:11:00]  You know what I'm saying?  Black people do get drunk, but we become drunk.  White people are like immediately to go somewhere, they got to be drunk.  White people are drunks.  I mean, let's be honest.  It's just a different culture with drinking.  It's just...  We got to deal with the crime.  It's not...  You know what it is?  It's only so one way to get through it.  I see it more depressing that black people act that way sober.  Black people don't have as much fun doing things.  Like, we don't have fun drinking.  It's...  Yeah.  Drinking is serious.  It's a process.  Yeah.  And white people have fun.  It's a process, right?  White people are a lot of fun. 
[04:11:30]  That's the one thing I tell black people.  White people are a lot of fun.  White people do a lot...  Sexually, a lot of fun.  Black people love fucking.  But it's not...  It's fucking.  It's like...  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You watch the...  It's like...  You know, I got buddies...  You know, white buddies that go,  Oh, dude, I put a baseball bat in her asshole.  It's like, what?  But it's like funny.  And they'll send you a picture and go,  Look at the culprit in the corner.  So it's the girl...  Yeah.  The girl's smiling, but he really showing me the baseball bat  and the bitch that he shoved her.  And it's fun.  But you know, black women, they love fucking, 
[04:12:00]  but it ain't...  It's not a lot of baseball bats.  There's got to be low respect.  Not a lot of peeing.  Oh, yeah.  There's respect.  A lot of fun.  Not a lot of fun.  No smacking, no choking and shit.  You know, it's like...  It's like that.  You ain't spanking her hiney.  I saw a porn on the bitch.  It was like,  Don't be trying to throw me around.  Oh, really?  Damn, bitch.  Can you...  Don't be trying to throw me...  Can you spank a black girl's hiney?  You can if you're just being forceful.  If you're like,  Bam, she's going to do that.  Like, there was a time I used to do a lot of...  You know, when I was really getting demon in my day. 
[04:12:30]  I used to...  Once you figure out certain things,  you learn how to...  You know, you get into the little spit thing.  You know what I mean?  I just like girls that...  Something about girls doing things  they ain't supposed to be doing really sexy.  So, you know,  I used to just go spit on my face,  you know,  and...  No, I can't.  I said,  Do it.  Go ahead.  Do it.  So then I would...  I would just spit on their face.  On the cheek.  Oh, shit.  On the cheek,  and then I'd just lick it off.  And once that happened,  you can feel her filth  coming along. 
[04:13:00]  Her filth is gone.  You can feel that she's just like,  Oh, my God.  What just happened?  Now she's...  Now she's just...  Now she's just...  Once girls get opened up to that filthy thing,  it's just...  It's...  That is such a beautiful fucking...  What's that, Jimmy?  You don't like that?  Not the licking it off part.  But that's just the...  It helps them with the dignity part.  Patrice just grossed out Jimmy for the first time.  I saw a little guy, though.  A picture of a guy spitting someone's face.  He said,  The girl spitting your face didn't bother me.  All right.  But a guy spitting someone's face...  Hey.  All right.  So... 
[04:13:30]  Wouldn't like that.  Blacks don't drink because they end up shooting each other.  Oh, man.  We shoot each other sober, dude.  That's at the black party.  That's clarity.  That's at a black party.  Shooting is a weed thing.  Oh, fuck.  Chris Houston.  I knew we'd get to this point.  Go ahead, Chris.  Jesus.  Hey, Patrice is full of crap.  The blacks don't...  The blacks dip on the drinks  because they don't want to buy extra drinks, man.  You sound rich.  Like, stop.  Like, it's a cultural thing.  It's not a money thing.  It's just we don't guzzle drinks 
[04:14:00]  because we don't drink to get drunk.  It's social.  It's just a social thing.  White people drink to get...  Some white people drink to get drunk.  You never see black people playing the game  where there's a fucking funnel  and a hole in a bitch's mouth.  Like, it doesn't happen.  That's why I asked you the question.  Drink, drink, drink.  It'll be one nigga in there doing it.  Like, one nigga with a lot of white friends.  But you don't see a bunch of niggas sitting around.  They poor Cavassier.  They poor Hennessy.  They get tipsy. 
[04:14:30]  And then you go,  Oh, shit, this nigga's drunk.  Yeah, but they don't have to drink as much.  And white girls stumble till they die.  And black girls get horny when they drink a little bit.  Black guys drink harder shit, right?  Yes.  We don't have fun with drinking.  They're not going out and drinking 18 beers.  Yeah, or trying to guzzle a tequila.  Liquor.  It's a different culture.  Like, stop.  You sip it and enjoy it a little bit.  Eh, kegs and the whole thing.  Wouldn't I?  You never did a keg party? 
[04:15:00]  No.  That's such a white boy.  When I do my cookouts,  the liquor I have,  because, you know,  I got mixed crowd.  I wouldn't know.  I buy the gym.  Thanks.  Oh, man.  You never got invited?  Come on.  Maybe once.  He sort of invited.  I think he invited you.  Sort of.  I think I got a sort of invite.  You coming?  Yeah.  I got one of those.  You coming?  I would go to one of your parties.  I'm going to invite you next time.  Cool.  I would like to check that out.  I invite you.  I just don't believe it.  I know you're weird about it.  I would go, though.  I just don't believe it.  I don't believe it,  but I'm going to.  I'm going to do it next time. 
[04:15:30]  I'm going to surprise you.  And here's what I like about Ant.  You coming in?  No.  No.  But I make sure for my white customers, I have Jim Bean.  Jim Bean.  For white people?  Here's something that's been in my house.  White people?  Listen.  This is what I know.  There's a lot of white.  Here's what I.  What do you think I drink?  You did the drug thing earlier. 
[04:16:00]  Wait.  Let me.  Go around the room.  What do you think we all drink?  As white boys.  I want to tell you what no one drinks is Bombay gin.  It's no one drinks Bombay gin.  No one drinks Bombay gin.  They drink Bombay Sapphire gin.  That's the difference.  Ah, shit.  I think I have Sapphire because I asked the guy with the top.  I have Bombay Sapphire gin.  It's been there five years.  No one fucks.  No one has touched it.  Okay.  Vodka.  Black people and white people love vodka. 
[04:16:30]  Yeah.  That's an easy one.  Black people love vodka.  Cranberry vodka.  Vodka and soda and white people like vodka straight or a little orange.  Vodka straight.  Yeah.  Not many white.  That's what I saw.  Really?  Black people love kvassi.  Any cognac.  White people do the Jim Beam, a little whiskey.  And for beer, I get dark beer for a white deuce, like a red stripe maybe.  And Corona for white people.  If I didn't make a choice, two beers. 
[04:17:00]  Corona for white people.  You got me.  Heineken for black people.  You got me.  That would be easy, right?  That's my...  Heineken.  And then a whole bunch of little...  I didn't know the Heineken's in the black thing.  ...the drinks, the coolers things.  Wine coolers.  Yeah.  Not wine...  But, you know, the fucking...  Kind of like...  Smirnoffs and...  Like the hard iced tea and all that.  That goes.  Smirnoff ice.  The girlies drink those.  You're like Louis XIII.  What's that?  Is that Kanye?  Louis Trey.  I don't drink.  I just...  No, I mean...  I buy Hennessy. 
[04:17:30]  I buy Kvassi.  I might give them my Louis Trey.  That's too much money.  That's like $400 for that bottle.  Isn't that like really expensive a shot?  Yeah, we got that from...  Oh, tequila.  Sorry.  I don't give that to us.  I bought $1,800 one time.  Oh, yeah.  Which is the dumbest...  I tried to do that cap thing.  It's the stupidest...  What's that?  The $1,800 tequila.  It's just dumb.  It's crazy.  It's just dumb.  Because you can't pour it in the cap.  No. 
[04:18:00]  It's impossible to do the cap thing.  I don't...  The thing with the cap...  He goes...  Here's the...  This is the fucking thing.  Man, I'm confused.  What is this?  I don't know.  This is the thing.  It's...  You know, the big tequila is...  What's the biggie?  Cuervo.  The major one.  Not Cuervo.  Patrol.  That's the one.  Niggas gotta have patrol.  So, Patron...  And then the one under that is a fucking $1,800.  And you put this $1,800 shit...  And it's supposed to be...  Hey, what can...  What can your cap do? 
[04:18:30]  Like, the thing is...  My cap can make a shot.  Your cap is just fucking a cork.  Like, whatever.  And it don't even work.  Yeah, it's...  You gotta do it the right way.  It's horse manure.  I don't get it.  It's a commercial.  You've never seen a commercial?  You just pour the bottle upside down, pretty much.  And it fills the...  It fills the cap.  But how do you take the fucking...  You gotta do it real quick.  You gotta do it real quick.  Oh, it's a whole thing?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's a whole thing.  It's stupid shit.  Wow, I didn't know this.  But Anthony is a...  Look, are you all right, buddy?  This nigga is...  This nigga's not like a junkie. 
[04:19:00]  It will.  I'm so...  He's so tired.  This nigga...  I'm like...  This nigga...  I can't even drive a lot.  What, you have a late night?  No, I actually didn't.  I had such a busy weekend.  Oh, fuck that.  I was...  Nodding like a junkie.  Jesus.  I was driving and, like, friggin' all weekend.  I didn't want to get home, man.  I don't know.  It's gonna be tough.  That escalade could careen off of some walls.  You gotta ask somebody to drive you home.  Watch me.  Take a cab, dude.  I didn't even notice he was nodding.  Are you going back in line?  I did watch.  He didn't close his eyes. 
[04:19:30]  I shouldn't...  One eye, man.  Bigger.  No, I should've...  I should've known because Zant stretches when he's tired.  Yeah, yeah.  Remember he did the stretch thing?  I've been stretching like crazy.  Yeah.  That's his...  It's the Monday morning fucking stretching.  That's Anthony's tell.  He's tired.  Zant's got TV tonight.  I know, but I gotta go home, too.  Why?  First to work out.  Oh, okay.  And then I gotta come back into the city.  So there's a lot of driving.  I'm gonna have to nap.  That's a lot of fucking money, dude.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Remy Martin.  How much has he ever heard of this one? 
[04:20:00]  Louis the 14th.  Well, this is a 13th.  Black Pearl.  But is that back from Louis the...  Actual Louis the 14th time?  Dude, I don't know.  No, no.  I never heard of this shit.  Louis the 14th?  $100,000.  We got a bottle of Louis the 13th from...  Which comedy club took care of us?  I don't remember now.  That's the cognac we have.  That's about...  Caroline's always takes care of us.  $100,000.  I bought $100,000 liquor.  You know what?  I would just stick my finger in.  Everybody lick.  Lick my finger.  There you go.  I wash my hand.  Here, you take a lick.  I got a question for the cognac people. 
[04:20:30]  My Louis the 13th, I've had for 10, 12 years because I don't drink this shit.  And it's gone through some temperature changes.  Does that fuck it up?  I don't think so.  It's been in really hot basements.  Do you have a bottle of 2,009 bottle of liquor in here?  Easy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The bottle looks all classy.  They say the empty bottle is worth like $500.  Something like that.  Mine isn't open.  Have you drunk it?  No.  No.  It's unopened.  I might give it to you for your friends.  I don't give a shit.  Oh, shit.  I don't need the money.  That's how much I don't drink.  I don't fucking just put...  Just to try something. 
[04:21:00]  And I would only invite people who understood that this is Louis the 13th.  That it's real good shit.  I bet you if I poured shots for all of us, none of us would know why it would be.  If I catch a nigga putting Diet Coke in the Louis the...  I'll smack the shit out of you.  He's mixing it up.  Did you just fucking put...  Did you just put cooler ice?  I guarantee...  It was fucking...  We pour shots.  Now, one of us in this room would be able to say why it's tasty and good.  I probably would hate it.  Yeah.  It's like over $100.  A lot of these restaurants cost $100.  $100 a shot for that shit.  $100 a shot for Louis the 13th. 
[04:21:30]  How good could it be?  That's what I'm saying.  I bet you we sipped that shit.  What was your drink of choice when you was doing your thing?  I was broke.  Some.  No, it's a gargler of choice.  That and Lavoris.  No, I would drink...  Ripple?  He had Ripple?  Any type of beer.  A lot of grain alcohol because it was very cheap.  We would have $5 to drink.  You had no money, so you had to buy the stuff.  You had moonshine.  That's what it was, yeah.  But I didn't like it.  It was terrible, but it got you loaded.  You're a tequila guy.  No, no.  I hate tequila.  I'm a Captain and Coke, Jack and Coke.  Oh, fucking...  Shit like that. 
[04:22:00]  Fucking whiskey.  Yeah, yeah.  All right.  Or Captain Morgan, you know, spiced rum.  That's great with Coke.  Although, over the weekend, I would have vodka and cranberry.  I like that shit.  I have a lot of wine.  Wine goes, too.  Wine.  I got a lot of wine.  And you're a wine guy?  Yeah, I like wine.  You're not a hard liquor guy.  No, I'm not really a drink.  What's your hard liquor if you decided to?  I stopped really drinking heavily when I hit 30.  When you were drinking heavily?  30 was the cutoff for me.  What did you stop drinking? 
[04:22:30]  I just drank a lot.  A lot of beer.  Anything?  I was a shot guy.  You know.  I did it under the cage.  Being at your house, I did have a fucking...  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  A Guinness stout.  I had to.  Yeah, Guinness.  I had to bop down.  You were hysterical.  I had to bop down.  You had one.  You're just sitting in that chair like, yep.  Yeah, you're meister.  All that shit.  Enjoyable.  It was very enjoyable.  It was very enjoyable.  I haven't been back since, though.  Let's get all...  Let's all get drunk.  I think I'm going to have a party on, like, a Labor Day weekend party.  I might call it off and come.  It's going to be like a... 
[04:23:00]  Yeah.  I mean, I might call off my thing and I don't know.  You said your party's going to be when we're not away.  A two-day one.  Well, it's Labor Day.  I'm out.  Got to have something.  I'm out.  I'll be there.  But I'm going to do, like, Saturday and Sunday.  Like, two days straight.  Can you be selective?  You can just let anybody crawl in.  No, no.  I can be pretty selective.  Oh, my bad.  At times.  Yeah.  Only one I can deal with.  I might be able to deal with passing hockey, but I'm not going to fucking...  Big A?  I'm going to push him in his pool.  I'm going to push him in your pool and watch it start sizzling.  Wait till you meet the new one, Ira. 
[04:23:30]  You've got to get Ira to your house.  No, I don't think Ira's going to be coming over my house.  Ira.  Hey, let's go to Joe.  I've got to know about my cognac really fast.  You know what's great, though, before Joe, real fast?  Yeah.  Patrice telling me that I was nodding was like the car weaving and almost hitting something.  You wake up and go, holy shit.  Because now I'm like, now I'm awake.  You were gone, dude.  Patrice was the wall that I almost hit.  Was he not?  I saw him because one eye kind of went like, what the fuck was that?  I'm going to miss that.  And his mouth was getting ready to... 
[04:24:00]  Yeah.  You're not a one-word answer guy, either.  No.  Unless you say, who's the problem in this country?  That's still two words.  In person.  In person.  In person.  In person.  In person.  No problem.  Yeah, I can tell you.  Uh, Joe, tell me about my cognac.  Oh, that cognac, man.  I mean, uh, Louis Trey is, uh, they put about one percent out of a barrel that was aged, you  know, like a couple hundred years ago. 
[04:24:30]  The rest of it's like, uh, 10, 20, 30 years after that.  And then it's in a Waterford crystal container.  Now, I've worked in the strip clubs and, uh, fine restaurants all over the country, and  the common rule amongst everybody, if you buy the last shot, you get the bottle.  You take it home.  So if you see something that's down to the fucking last drop, say, I'll take that last  drop, but, you know, give me the bottle.  And they'll, they should do it at their quality place, but, you know.  Well, I've seen it, uh, $100, $110 a shot. 
[04:25:00]  Is it worth it?  I don't, I don't know.  No way.  You know, I, literally, honestly, yeah.  You know what?  I'm right with you, Ann, because I've sold bottles of wine for 45 grand.  Wow.  And is it fucking worth it?  You know?  Yeah, it is.  Uh, if, you know, if you're making a billion dollars a year, if you just, you know, if you're  the owner of Walmart and, uh, you just made $200,000 by the time you finished dinner,  you know, it's all relevant.  I had a, uh, I had two, $2,000 bottles of wine.  I, I obviously didn't buy them. 
[04:25:30]  Uh, I'll beat you to the punch.  I, uh, it was a guy that owned an island off Cape Cod and he was breaking out this, this,  I told the story a few times where the cork is basically falling out of the bottle.  It was like 1967 or something like that.  It's not even that old.  The label's like falling off this damn thing and, and man, was it good?  Abso-fucking-lutely.  Was it $2,000 good?  I don't know.  Right, right.  You know what I mean?  I don't know.  I, I, I knew I was drinking some good shit though.  Absolutely. 
[04:26:00]  Because I drank enough wine to know, but, you know.  Wine's, as long as they take care of it.  Wine is living.  Now, when you, you're talking about, uh, the Louis Trey being hot, uh, don't worry about it.  It's distilled.  Any distilled product, it can go up and down in temperature.  It doesn't matter.  It's not, you know, I might give it to Patrice for your friends.  Yeah, Patrice says he has it.  If you're pouring cognac, then you take this bottle off my hands.  I don't know what to do with it.  I'm going to really do an injustice to this bottle.  You ever see his friends fucking will have some salmon and do a shot? 
[04:26:30]  I might stop pouring over a bitch's head.  Hey, asshole.  What's the, what's the piece?  Motherfuck yourself, this is Louis XIII.  What the fuck?  You ever see that bottle?  When that motherfucker's empty?  Fucking refill it with, uh, Hennessy VF.  And no one will know, right?  And nobody will know.  That's what I'm thinking.  Maybe you can do that, too.  I'm filling it with fruit punch.  I'm fucking, it's raining, bitch.  Ice tea.  Pour it all over your body, and then see what everybody fucking says.  Goddamn, that motherfucker's pouring.  Danny, what's, uh, Louis XIII's going, all right, enough. 
[04:27:00]  Right, sir.  Thank you.  He's obsessed.  Thank you.  He really is.  He's screaming about it.  What's a basic bottle of Louis XIII going for right now?  Average price is looking like $1,700.  No, really?  Then the price has gone way the fuck up since we got our bottle in.  Yeah.  I was offered $1,000 at a liquor store for it once.  Wow, really?  Because I was just casually talking to the guy.  He goes, I'll fucking buy that bottle right now for $1,000.  I remember that.  A grand?  That's all the time.  I don't know where the fucking guy is anymore.  So that's a bargain?  Somewhere out on Long Island.  What?  That's a bargain?  I guess. 
[04:27:30]  He thought he could make money off it at the time.  So now you're telling me it's pushing almost $2,000 for this bottle?  With the, what is that?  Wow.  I got that one right there with the box, the red box.  Yep.  Right there.  Yeah, that's mine.  Well, this is a small one.  That's the 50.  That's a very small bottle.  But I think what you have is probably the 750.  Maybe mine is the small.  No, no, no.  I don't think so.  Let's show it in the box.  It's that one right there with the box.  With the weird box.  Dash, bitch, what is Louis XIII?  $2,000, motherfucker.  $2,000 fucking dollars.  Come on, you want it? 
[04:28:00]  Crawl.  Crawl.  How much is that?  $17.  Almost $2.  I'm opening it up.  I'm like, all right hoes.  Yeah.  Bring on the bitches.  They wouldn't even know.  No, they wouldn't know.  There's probably not that many bitches that wouldn't even know.  Not that many guys would even know.  Most people wouldn't know.  It's Louis the CK.  It's just cum.  Yeah.  Just cum with freckles on it.  That's what gives it the color. 
[04:28:30]  Fucking freckles.  Are you serious?  Really?  So this is...  It was given to us years ago.  It was very nice.  Oh man, a long time ago.  I wanted to say it was Rascals before they closed.  No, right?  No.  No.  I think it might have been though.  Do you still have that bottle of the Sam Adams triple Bach fucking...  Oh yeah, I get that too still.  What's that?  What is this rich shit?  No, that's another thing that Jim Cook gave us.  It was a special thing.  He only made like a thousand bottles, gave me an ant one.  A beer?  It's a weird beer. 
[04:29:00]  It's like...  A shot of that shit will kill you.  It's almost like cognac.  Yeah.  It's like a fucking...  How big's the bottle?  Heavy duty.  It's like a...  I didn't look that in a while.  It's illegal to sell in a lot of states because it's just too much alcohol.  That's right.  I forgot all about this.  It might be.  Utopia?  No, if I saw the bottle, I would know.  Limited edition.  And how much is it?  Like $800?  Well, look at the prices online for this.  Triple Bach.  Yeah, it was some kind of triple Bach.  Triple Bach.  That's it.  That's the bop.  That's it right there.  $9.95?  Oh, great. 
[04:29:30]  Thanks, Jim.  Thanks, Jim Cook.  You're bragging about a $10 beer?  I'm so fucking happy, you pieces of shit.  The next story was, yeah, for Dale Cashstone flew in and made us a golf woman.  Ed, you know that's it.  Is that it?  I've been saving this bottle like it's the most valuable thing I've ever owned.  No way.  Hang on, hang on, hang on.  It's nine...  It's nine euros.  It's a $20.  So it's a $20 bottle.  No, come on.  Oh, you fucking...  Dude, mine's in a glass case like it's the Mona Lisa. 
[04:30:00]  Is that fucking thing like signed and shit?  Well, ours was signed, though.  So throw a couple bucks off.  It was a cool autograph.  We'll take a couple bucks off because it's damaged.  Find another one that looks like that bottle, Danny.  Put that shit in your cocky cereal, nigga.  Just eat that.  I'm going to go home and I'll tweet.  Millennium.  It was the Millennium.  All right, what's the Millennium about?  Ah, that's $8.95.  Sam Adams' Millennium.  What's the Millennium about?  That's the one that I know as being like the super expensive.  That's the one.  Where's the Millennium? 
[04:30:30]  It's this stuff.  The utopiness.  No, it's not it.  It was in that other bottle.  You guys are so happy.  Put in Sam Adams' Millennium.  I did, you did.  But the bottle doesn't look like that, Danny.  It looked like the other one, I'm telling you.  I'll bring it in tomorrow.  I know it looks like that.  You really thought that was worth something?  That's $6 beer?  I know it's good.  I wish that this was Antique Roadshow.  Oh, would you be surprised if I told you this was $20?  Dude, I'm telling you, that is the exact fucking bottle.  Three bottles, 40 bones, dude.  My great-great-grandfather gave me this beer. 
[04:31:00]  Well, this shit is.  I am going to throw that fucking thing out in the street.  It's not only spoiled, but it's $10.  I'm going to shake it up and just fucking dump it in my pool.  How great is that?  I've been sitting in this thing like it's the most valuable thing I know.  And then show the mover to be careful with it.  Oh, yeah.  Vintage 1997 is fucking $40.  And that's for three bottles.  For three bottles.  You know when you move, you always have a box of shit you don't trust anyone with?  Yeah, I'll be taking the triple box.  That's definitely in that box.  Take the triple box in the car.  Don't put it in the truck.  Right. 
[04:31:30]  Oh, fuck.  What a waste of time.  I'm so happy.  How funny is that?  We were bragging like, wait till you see how much this is.  Hey, guys.  Let me open the treasure chest and show you what I got.  We got $40 for three.  Oh, we just got the Miller Lite, top-of-the-line beer.  Miller Lite.  We just got Coors, the Coors Special Edition.  You know what?  Fuck you.  He gave you three beers.  Fuck him.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, man.  He made it sound like...  He even said, remember, he said that there's only a thousand of these or something like that. 
[04:32:00]  That's bullshit.  What a motherfucker.  Oh, that's classic.  Fuck.  We got the Budweiser, Conan the Barbarian Edition.  It comes with a sword.  It's worth zillions.  I was scared to bring it over fucking state lines because he said the beer is illegal in, I don't know, what?  Ten states or something.  That's overproofed.  Yeah.  Sam Adam lied like the real Sam Adam.  I'm bringing that shit in tomorrow.  That guy's a liar.  I'll bring that shit in tomorrow.  What's the matter of mother beers we got? 
[04:32:30]  And I'm not giving you my Louis XIII because you're not going to treat it properly.  I'm taking my gift back.  People are going to drink it.  They're going to drink it?  I'm going to let people drink it.  Yeah.  Special occasions, though.  Really special.  All right.  But I want to make sure people know.  Everything you've done for me, Patrice, I'm giving you my fucking bottle.  Thank you.  I don't need it.  What am I going to do with it?  I'm going to Google it, print it out, what it is, and then send it out to anybody coming  to the house to know what the fuck Louis XIII did.  See what excitement you get back.  See if there's any kind of buzz on it.  All right? 
[04:33:00]  I am so angry.  Was it Utopia?  No.  It was Millennium.  It was Millennium.  Utopia is $350 a bottle.  No, no.  Most expensive Sam Adam.  I'm just saying this.  No, it's that bottle, Patrice.  I'm telling you.  A college professor paid $4,910 for Sam Adams' Millennium beer at an auction for bottle  number one.  What bottle do we have?  Because he signed ours.  Oh, $3,000. 
[04:33:30]  Bottle number $4,000.  What is that?  He said $3,001.  Sam Adams' Millennium.  Because that's the one that's expensive.  Yeah, but that's not what we have.  And it's only $600.  We don't have that, though.  That's not the bottle.  That's not the bottle.  I'm positive.  Maybe he changed the bottle.  Maybe.  They changed car, you know, design.  It's that right there.  To the right.  God damn it.  No.  That shit.  It's not it either.  Fuck.  He gave you $10 beer.  But you know what?  $10 beer is special.  Oh, shit.  As opposed to $1, $1.99. 
[04:34:00]  I think we're even.  He gave us a $10 bottle of beer.  A six pack is $2.99.  We destroyed his business for about five years.  Destroyed his name for five years.  Maybe it's a good trade-off.  He had a rough five years because of us.  Now no one remembers.  There was a day, Patrice, because of us.  Cover the Boston Herald.  All the bar owners pouring Sam Adams down the fucking sink.  Why?  Front fucking page because of us.  Why?  Because he was sponsored our dumb sex for Sam.  Right.  And he didn't know what he was getting in. 
[04:34:30]  Because they felt it was bad.  They said it's fine.  It's causing domestic violence and drunk driving deaths.  But the fact that O.B. Anthony uses his guns.  But hardcore.  Fucking asshole Boston bar owners.  Hardcore Irish bar owners pouring it down the fucking sink.  Made the front page of the Herald.  I would love to.  Could you find that?  Is there?  Nah, probably not.  That might be tough to find.  I don't know.  Oh, yeah.  Unfortunately, we haven't talked to Jim Cook since.  And he used to be a really good friend of the show.  Oh, wow.  He brought us on vacation with us.  Yeah.  The Sam Adams guy?  Everything.  We did fucking gigs at his brewery, which is in the middle of the ghetto. 
[04:35:00]  Where at?  Oh, man.  It's...  In Boston?  Do you remember where it was then?  Way in the ghetto.  In Boston?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  It was like in the middle of nowhere, too.  Yeah.  It was scary getting in and out.  Yeah.  That's the bottle.  That is it.  That's definitely it.  Fuck it.  You fucking...  What a prick.  You $4 beer.  Drink that shit when you get home, nigga.  Yeah, right?  I'm bringing it in tomorrow.  Down that.  Fuck.  I really thought we had something. 
[04:35:30]  I'm like saving that thing.  Isn't it in a wood case, too?  Oh, yeah.  It's all fucking dollied up.  The wood case is worth more.  Yeah.  That's why I was like, oh, this has to be good shit.  Are you fucking serious?  It's in a wood case.  I'll tweet it later.  That was it.  Wait.  Was it this stuff?  Because this is different.  Come on.  That's it.  Come on.  This stuff is different than the triple.  Yeah, but how much is it?  I don't know.  I hope it's even less.  It's $2.  Come on.  I hope it's even less.  Yeah, watch.  Did ours have three M's on it?  I think it did.  It was the minimum. 
[04:36:00]  Come on.  Let's roll this dice again.  My card is more expensive.  Come on.  Let's do this.  Come on.  See, it's very rare.  It's very rare.  You can't buy this shit, right?  We're the only ones with it.  Look.  Unopened rare.  Three down.  Sam Adams, Millennium, L, triple M.  How much?  Here we go.  Come on.  Come on, bitch.  How much?  There's the case.  Come on.  Sold for what?  There's the case.  $14.  That's the case.  Shut up.  That's the start.  That's the wood case.  Very rare.  Hand signed.  This is probably the one you guys have. 
[04:36:30]  Hand signed.  That's what we got.  Come on.  It says that.  I say $4,910.  They sell it for $4,900.  Take that.  Other limited edition bottles go for more than $1,000 in online auctions.  Take that.  All right.  I would have laughed so hard if you broke it and then realized that was the one you had.  I'm glad you found a way to have some self-esteem behind this stupid beer that you know is nine bucks.  And you have a wooden box, too.  Look, I'll make a video.  I'm going to make a video.  I'm going to show how expensive it is, and then I'm going to take a hammer to mine. 
[04:37:00]  Oh, wow.  Those type of videos do very well on the wall.  And it's liquor or it's beer.  It's like hardcore, over-the-top, 500-proof.  It's made like beer, but the process they do, they put it through so much that it becomes like liquor.  Yeah.  It becomes like cognac.  It's 21%.  Wow.  Is that a lot?  As I said, wow, is that a lot?  For beer.  Of course it is.  What is that the equivalent of?  It's like a...  21%.  What is that? 
[04:37:30]  Vodka's what?  40.  Vodka's 40?  Yeah.  Most spirits are 40.  It's like a liquor.  Liquors are usually around 20%.  All right.  So it's...  Well, we'll lick him.  It's like Jägermeister.  You know, something like that.  Yeah, that's it.  So two shots equal one shot of vodka or something.  That's it right there.  That's the shit.  With the blue felt.  Right.  What is the price?  How was I rooting against you?  It's very difficult to find.  I'm having trouble finding your rooting against you.  I know.  It makes me very happy.  Jimmy wants it to be worth nothing. 
[04:38:00]  Of course.  Or break it when it's worth a lot.  Yes.  So what is it?  $10 or $5,000?  No, no.  It's just $10.  Because that's the thing.  There's two different ones.  But Noah Jim Cook, he probably gave us the cheap one thinking it was the...  You know, and just put it in the nice box.  What box?  If it says triple Bach on it, it's $10.  If it has three M's on it, it's like $5,000.  I think it might be triple Bach, because we've been saying triple Bach for years.  No, but I think he gave us triple Bach once.  Really?  And then he gave us the Millennium, because I remember seeing the case says Millennium 
[04:38:30]  on it.  I better find that fucking bottle, man.  God damn it.  Now I've got to find it.  Yeah.  I might have ditched it thinking it was...  Oh, in the move?  I don't know.  Now I'm a little scared.  I'm going to take a look, yo.  $5,000, though.  $4,000 anyway, right?  Yeah, but you said that they were signed and numbered and stuff, right?  Yeah, yeah.  Was there a number on it?  I don't remember.  Yeah, I think every bottle was numbered.  Well, because that's the good stuff.  I mean, that triple Bach shit's not going to be signed.  All marked, all numbered?  No, no, no.  Put mine online for fucking sale, man. 
[04:39:00]  Yeah.  Pay for my trip.  Why not?  Apparently this is very rare.  Joke.  There's only 3,000 bottles?  Yes.  Yeah, that's about...  That's it.  Only 3,000, and we have two of them.  There you go.  Nice.  We're in.  Dang, we're in.  I'm glad we got to the bottom of that.  Yeah.  I wouldn't even drink that shit.  Huh?  And I'll drink anything.  Let me say hi to Bill.  Hello.  Hello, Bill. 
[04:39:30]  Hey, gentlemen.  How are you?  Yeah, that shit, it's nothing but triple Bach in the fancy 750 milliliter bottle.  Triple Bach was only $7 a bottle in the store.  It's just in a nice bottle with a nice case and stuff.  It ain't worth shit.  I know.  I mean, it would be great for the show if we had the shitty one, but now we're starting  to think that maybe we do have the good one, so blow me.  We should have stopped where we were and make everyone believe that we got fucked, but I  really think we actually got one of those nice bottles that's worth a few bucks. 
[04:40:00]  No, you do.  It was one of the limited edition.  I believe there was only 1,000.  I used to work for a distributor and a liquor store.  You said 3,000.  What's the matter with you?  You listen to the show?  All right, Bill.  Thanks.  It's the O.B. and Anthony Show's Best of O.N.A.  Best of O.N.A.  We'll be right back.  Don't go anywhere.  Hi, I'm Maria Bartiromo.

[04:45:00]  How many people are going to shoot up and crack their skulls on things that are 10 feet above them?  Oh, exactly.  It just looks like a balloon letting all the air out, just going through the sky.  It's winging through, and you're going to fucking knock your head into a building.  Yeah, Gus will take you right against the side of a building until you'll kill office workers.  Shit, pack my ass.  Two things.  The mule kicking the football was a fine movie called Gus.  Thanks for everybody on Instant Feedback.  Gus was on a football team, Anthony, and he kicked winning field goals for the team. 
[04:45:30]  Yes.  And no one saw a problem with this.  No one had a problem with a mule being the kicker on a football team.  Right.  We have the trailer for Gus, but that was another Disney film.  Yeah, yeah.  Another great Disney film of an animal doing something.  How many fucking dumb movies did they make us sit through?  Wow.  Where animals were doing things.  Everyone knows the movies, though.  They were that popular.  It's all we had.  What crap they gave us.  They fed us just shit. 
[04:46:00]  Yeah, this new generation has fucking Avatar.  We had a stupid mule kicking football.  Oh, my God.  How do we even fucking relate to these people anymore?  We're fucking.  No wonder they hate us, though.  No wonder the younger generation has no respect for us.  Right.  It's what you faggots found entertaining.  There you go.  Gus, 1976.  Was that Bob Crane's last movie?  Somebody saying that in here.  Who's that?  Bob Crane.  Really?  It was Bob.  Oh, my God.  Don Knotts was in Gus?  Don Knotts was in it. 
[04:46:30]  Why is there a helmet on the donkey?  With an atom on the side of it, like a nuclear little symbol.  Well, that was the name of the group, the Atoms.  The team, the Atoms.  Oh, the Atoms.  Well, they had to make it futuristic.  They were like a nerdy team.  From the Walt Disney Don Knotts collection.  He has a fucking football helmet on with a hole cut for his big, dumb donkey ears.  Who's going to tackle that fucking thing, braying and biting with its teeth?  And why does it need a helmet?  You ever hit a donkey in the head? 
[04:47:00]  It's not getting hurt.  And could it really kick accurately?  Wouldn't it be just willy-nilly every time he tried kicking a football?  Of course it would.  He would just go, and shit by the ball.  It'd be like, time out, fucking asshole animal.  He did it once.  His tail slowly goes up.  You see his asshole pucker and fucking prolapse.  And little shits come out.  You're not far off.  Because all these movies, there was some kind of catch where they had to give the thing something to do its special skill. 
[04:47:30]  Yes.  I don't know what it would be in this case.  They would pinch its cock really hard.  That would kick you.  Oh, yes.  Do you have any footage, Danny?  Any footage of the fucking donkey kicking?  Oh, who doesn't want to see that?  It has to be.  Come on.  I think even YouTube said, you know what?  Let's not put fucking Gus Clips up here.  Gus.  Gus the mule.  Gus the mule.  There was another one coming.  Fucking some woman from Tijuana to suck its dick before it kicks. 
[04:48:00]  Shoots a big donkey load in her face.  He has a bachelor party jerking off right in front of the football.  Just spies Gus.  Gus stinks.  His helmet really made me angry.  Because his legs would break.  If he got tackled, he's all clumsy.  Oh, yeah.  Very clumsy.  No Gus Clips?  How could there be a Gus Clip?  No one cares.  No one cares.  It's a mule kicking fucking footballs, man. 
[04:48:30]  No?  Nothing?  It's not the...  What was the movie?  Broomsticks something.  Bedknobs and Broomsticks.  Someone is reminding me that the bed in that movie, the flu.  Really?  They had a flying bed.  I thought it was about a girl's first foray into masturbation.  An uncle, bedknobs and broomsticks.  Escape to which mountain?  That was another one.  That had what?  Something flying in?  Yeah, something's always flying back then. 
[04:49:00]  Everything was flying.  What the fuck was that about?  Kevin in Connecticut.  What's up, sir?  Morning, guys.  Hey.  Hello.  Remember Don Knotts' finest acting was in As a Fish?  Incredible Mr. Limpet.  Yeah, he turned into a Don Knotts cartoon fish.  How the hell did that happen?  He fell overboard, I think, right?  But you can't just turn into a fish if you fall overboard.  I know!  He turned into a fish that looked like Don Knotts.  But we need all the twists in these movies. 
[04:49:30]  How did he turn into a fish?  You just don't turn into a fish.  Was there some kind of chemical reaction or something?  No, it was in his own mind.  He turned into a fish.  He fell in love with another fish.  Was he drowning?  In the end, he dove in the water, and I guess he became a fish.  Oh, really?  No, he died.  That's not it.  Here's the answer.  The name is in it.  It's Mr. Limpet.  He could no longer achieve an erection.  And his wife was humiliating him in front of his friends, and she said he had a fish dick.  She said an old fish dick, because it was floppy. 
[04:50:00]  His fish was like a little fucking guppy.  Like a dead minnow.  His fish was like a little...  His fish.  His dick.  Whatever.  Yes.  He turned into Abe Vigoda.  Did he join the army?  The fish joined the army?  I think Mr. Limpet.  The fish.  Mr. Limpet joined the army.  And became like an underwater fucking army thing.  Or navy something. 
[04:50:30]  Let me thank you, Sarah.  Let's go to Sean.  We're trying to learn a little more about this Gus movie.  That's the one I'm obsessed with today.  Sean and Idaho.  Hey, good morning.  Good morning, Sean.  Hello.  I remember this movie from Wild War, when Disney was on NBC, way back when.  And the guy who held the ball for the field goals was the owner of the donkey.  Yeah.  And they lived on a farm somewhere in Europe.  And when he said a certain code word, and it kind of sounded like a sneeze, the donkey would kick his leg. 
[04:51:00]  And so he brought him to America, and the team, the Adams were a terrible football team, could never score.  Of course.  So they would kick, the donkey would kick 80, 90-yard field goal.  A 90-yard field goal.  Yeah, because they could never make it past third down.  So he would make some kind of sound, like a sneeze.  Yeah.  The donkey would kick a 90-yard field goal, and then they started winning.  Somebody is saying that the word was oi-age. 
[04:51:30]  Yeah, that was it, oi-age.  What the fuck does oi-age mean?  So the guy holding the ball who owned the mule would have to say oi-age.  Probably a derogatory term.  It's an anti-Semitic term.  Now, what was the twist in the movie?  Because the mule couldn't get away with this the entire movie.  Obviously, something had to go wrong, where now the team's depressed, like, oh, fuck, our secret weapon is fucked up now.  You know what it was?  They had to paint a Jew's face on the football, and oi-age meant kick the Jew in farmer language.  And the other team objected. 
[04:52:00]  Walt lumped it.  The guy hung up, and oi-age was the thing.  Okay.  Oi-age.  But all these movies fall apart, because something happens.  Like, you can't say oi-age anymore or something.  Well, you look at the original Nutty Professor with Jerry Lewis.  Right.  It started wearing off.  Remember?  He was Buddy Love.  Sure.  And he would be singing.  He would be singing about the black magic.  And then he would start turning back.  And then it started growing. 
[04:52:30]  He turned back into the professor.  And then he was Buddy Love.  Get out of here, you broad.  He was, you know, smoking cigarettes and drinking.  And then he turned back into the professor.  Was he an ass as the professor?  No, he was a complete bumbling fool.  Couldn't get a chick.  Didn't he have buck teeth and all that?  Buddy Love was just fucking at anything that moved.  Yeah.  And yeah.  He had the big buck teeth.  Horrible classic.  And he walked around just talking about his formulas. 
[04:53:00]  Oh, and you want to know the twist?  Stella Stevens was in that one.  She was the babe that Buddy Love was like fucking just pounding.  Was she hot?  Stella Stevens was all right for the time.  Let me go to Ron in Arizona because he's got the twist in the Gus movie.  Because all the Disney movies had some dumb twist.  Yeah.  Go ahead, Ron.  Yeah.  The twist was simply that the guy that held the ball was a little guy.  The one called Howard Oyish, which meant kick.  Well, the opposing team kidnapped him, and so the donkey wouldn't kick the ball without 
[04:53:30]  him saying Oyish.  And this girl that liked the little kicker guy, she got Gus to kick the ball.  And the guy was all depressed because now he was of no use because Gus would kick for  anybody now.  Ah.  Did he commit suicide at the end of the movie?  Yeah.  Is that Stella fucking topless?  We got to go, bro.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Look at those long, heavy tits.  She went topless way too fucking late in her life. 
[04:54:00]  Those are long tits.  So who is this?  This is Stella?  Stella Stevens.  She's nice.  Like big areolas.  She's sexy.  Travis's screen is in the way.  God damn it.  Can we move that picture over somehow?  I bet if she laid down.  Wow.  If she laid down on her back, though, those things would totally be under her armpits.  They're just out of range.  Yeah.  They could be up a little higher.  They're big and heavy, but they're just out of range.  They're sagging just slightly too much.  It looks like the aspect ratio is off on the picture.  It looks like Stella liked to get naked, though, huh? 
[04:54:30]  Yeah.  She must have been a Playboy girl.  She must have been a fucking clothes off.  Stella Stevens.  Stella Stevens.  What does she look like now?  Is there a good picture?  Do you want to see the fucking curse of time?  Why would we do this to ourselves?  Just look at the curse of fucking time.  Let's make sure she's still alive.  Let's just make sure she's...  She's still alive?  Oh, fuck.  All right.  Let's see what she looks like now.  That's going to be a problem.  Because the one picture that sort of looks hot, there was already problems setting in.  Yeah. 
[04:55:00]  Oh!  No, that's not her.  It can be.  Oh, Christ.  She looks like the whole Vicky bitch.  Not bad, actually, for her age.  How old is she?  She's got to be 77.  Oh, yeah.  She's all right.  Wow.  Would you?  Yeah.  No, not now.  No.  Back then.  Why not, man?  No.  Do the Stella Stevens.  For the story.  Yeah.  For the story.  I wouldn't eat her pussy after hot, lead, and cold feet.  Look at that fucking ass on her.  Yeah, she was buxom.  She had a nice ease. 
[04:55:30]  She was one of those that totally fit the bill for back then.  Had the tits.  The wide hips.  Oh, and Gus the mule waited for the word to kick the ball.  The bad guys put a different mule in.  What?  Huh?  You have to have bad guys in Disney films.  They put a different mule in?  They couldn't fucking do shit.  The bad guys?  Were they the Negroes or the Jews in the Disney movie?  Which was the bad guy?  Well, what year was Gus?  70-something.  I don't know. 
[04:56:00]  Maybe not, though.  Maybe that was like...  Oh, 70-60.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, Walt was dead already, right?  All right.  Dean in Maine wants to talk about Disney films.  Dean.  You've got to remember that Kurt Russell got all his stardom from all the, like, the world's  strongest man.  Kurt Russell was in all these movies.  Yeah, Kurt Russell was in a shitload of Disney movies when he was a little, pretty much a  little kid.  Right.  Yeah.  And then you've got, like, the Apple Dumpling Gang and Don Hodge.  Now, did...  The shakiest gun in the West. 
[04:56:30]  Now, did Kurt Russell make the jump when he went and did used cars?  Or was he still doing Disney films after that?  When he finally made his big jump.  Right.  You know, obviously he's had a lot of decent movies.  Escape from New York.  Yeah.  That was a biggie.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Good movies.  Yeah, he was like...  You're bringing back all kinds of memories.  Of horrid memories of terrible fucking movies. 
[04:57:00]  Uh, the bad guys, Anthony, were Spinner and Crankcase?  Uh-oh.  Were they, like, motorheads?  Motorcouch, is that true?  Were they, like, bikers and motorheads?  I don't know.  Were they the bad guys and Gus?  Sounds like a morning radio team.  Spinner and Crankcase.  Yeah.  Spinner and Crankcase all morning.  We have outrageous fucking names, but we can't do shit because it's regular radio.  I love that. 
[04:57:30]  That was the best of O.B. and Anthony.  Best of O.B. and Anthony.  Follow ONA online at ONA Show on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter.  Hi, I'm Maria Bartiromo.
