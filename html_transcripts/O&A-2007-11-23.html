<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast unfolded as a chaotic series of segments centered largely around the interns.  The show began with a discussion of intern Ricky’s repeated failures in completing simple errands, particularly his half-hour absence while fetching coffee.  His incompetence in navigating Manhattan became a running joke.  This was followed by the farcical entrance of intern Brian, sporting an eye patch and head bandage, claiming a motorcycle accident.  His story quickly unraveled under intense questioning from the hosts and callers, revealing inconsistencies and ultimately his complete fabrication of the injury.  Brian's admission led to his dismissal from the show, but not before other interns shared anecdotes about his history of exaggerating illnesses.  A listener vote was called to determine Brian's fate, resulting in a tie. This decision was then left to the listeners, with the final outcome being that Brian could stay, but had to remain at least 20 feet away from Opie and continue wearing the eye patch.

The show then segued into a highly explicit discussion about interns Derek and Danny, who were caught on the office webcam engaging in indecent exposure, with Danny's mother also participating.  Steve, using remote access software, had monitored and recorded the events.  This segment involved graphic descriptions and extensive listener calls, culminating in jokes about the incident and the possibility of an “Office Cam Day” feature.

A recurring theme throughout the broadcast was the mistreatment and hazing of the interns.  Ricky was repeatedly sent on ridiculous errands for bagels and coffee, his orders deliberately misinterpreted by the hosts.  Another intern, Sam, suffered an injury requiring hospital treatment after being sent on a mission to differentiate between an apple fritter and apple cake, which resulted in a racist and homophobic tirade towards a Starbucks employee.  Intern Sydney (Luca) appeared with a black eye, prompting speculation and jokes from the hosts. The show also revisited the past failures of intern John ("Memento Guy"), whose short-term memory issues led to numerous food and drink order mistakes.  More instances of Ricky's incompetence were highlighted, further fueling the comedic chaos.

Musicians Bret Michaels and Rob Zombie made brief appearances to promote their music.  Throughout the show, there were numerous instances of vulgar language, homophobic slurs, and racist remarks.  A substantial segment focused on intern Tom, whose short stature became the target of extensive ridicule.  His height was measured against another guest, Jimmy, leading to crude jokes and comparisons.  Tom's clothing problems and a wrist tattoo also fueled the mockery. This segment was punctuated by further incidents of Ricky's failures, including bringing the wrong beverage, leading to more comedic chaos and interruptions. The segment ended with the anticipation of Ricky's next (likely disastrous) errand: fetching an apple.  The show was characterized throughout by crude humor, name-calling, and frequent interruptions stemming from the interns’ mishaps.

[00:00:00]  The virus is an XL channel which may contain explicit language.  Channel blocking is available by calling 1-800-XM-RADIO or in XM-CANADA, 877-438-9677.  I hear nothing. Am I on? I can't hear myself at all.  Shut up.  Wrong mic.  What? Really?  You're talking to the fan. You want to be talking to the guest.  Don't ever talk to the fan.  I can hear myself a little better now.  Yeah, how's my level?  Let's do it.  I want more. Give me a little more volume, please. 
[00:00:30]  I should definitely be higher than the fan.  Can I have a little more? I have no snare in my headphones.  I need a little track.  Oh, now I'm too loud.  How's that?  You can't hear me at all.  All right, I'm here now. That's better.  How's that, Sam?  Who broke this chair already?  You're giving him the snare.  No, that came that way.  Sam's got more snare.  It's used furniture.  Good.  Ah, it's much better.  All right, let's do it up.  I have no snare in my headphones.  Oh, yeah, I'm, yeah, snare.  Hi, welcome to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Uh, this edition is the worst of the interns that have been, uh, past, present for this show. 
[00:01:00]  Eric finally got one of his theme worst ofs passed. Nice.  I've had a few.  I like theme worst ofs because it makes it its own show again.  It's like another reason to listen.  What do we got up first, Sam?  Well, throughout this whole worst of show, we're going to be hearing a lot about intern Ricky.  Now, I remember intern Ricky very well.  And he was not good.  No, he was incompetent at best.  Yeah, I mean...  Big heart. Really tried hard.  Yeah.  You know what Ricky was good at?  Nothing.  Making me look really good. 
[00:01:30]  Oh, you were the same intern class as him, Travis?  I do remember one time Ricky couldn't find the Rock and Roll Deli because he thought it was the Blue Awning Deli or something like that.  Oh, he's so stupid.  Should we talk about all the bits or should we just play them?  No.  We should just play them.  Let's hear the first one now.  When?  Shut up. That was the out.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Does anybody know where the fuck Ricky is?  Why? What happened?  Oh, my goodness.  What's wrong?  Oh, boy.  He sent...  I sent him for a coffee before the show started. 
[00:02:00]  It was before the show started.  Where the hell is he?  For a medium coffee with a little bit of milk.  Well, he's not buying it from those savages.  What?  He hasn't come back yet.  He hasn't come back?  Oh, I hope he's all right.  See, I'm thinking maybe he had a problem down in the streets of New York, the tough streets.  I'm thinking that's the only acceptable answer.  Maybe he'd be better.  Because if I look outside and I see the cherries spinning on an ambulance and they're loading that little incompetent into the back, where's Ricky?  He got lost.  No, he didn't.  What? 
[00:02:30]  I'm not kidding.  Stop it.  We sent him to the new place for food and I don't think he found his way back.  Oh, I jumped for a start.  That's right around the corner.  I know.  He didn't know where he was going.  How do you get lost in Manhattan at this hour?  This is Ricky.  Maybe he got...  It's a grid.  Maybe he got in the middle of some intern wars.  Oh, really?  Maybe there's some pop-pop going on.  Has there been some gunfire outside our studios, like Hot 97?  Yes, Nathaniel.  Well, I just got Jim's delicious, hopefully, banana at the place Ricky's supposed to be at.  No sign of him. 
[00:03:00]  Oh, my God.  He's probably just wandering around Central Park trying to find his way back here.  He's a little slow.  Nate G is going to slink some lead into him when he gets back here, I bet.  Going to have some gunfire.  Yeah.  Wow.  All right, well...  He got lost.  Does he have a cell phone or anything?  Of course not.  He probably ate it.  He doesn't know how to answer it.  He's a little slow.  A little slow.  Nice kid.  A little slow.  You know how the streets work in Manhattan?  They're numbered.  They go up and down.  It's pretty easy.  If you're on 56th and you have to get to 57th, you pretty much know where you got to go. 
[00:03:30]  He's been gone a half hour, and all he had to do was cross the street.  All I wanted was coffee.  This is why the rule is, no, he can't touch my food, because this stuff happens all the time.  All I wanted was...  All the time, Jimmy.  All the time with him.  How's your banana?  Is it too hard?  Well, Nathaniel got it.  No.  It's a perfect banana.  I haven't caught Nathaniel testing it before.  He was kind of slapping on his cheek, and he said, that's the right consistency.  He's a good boy. 
[00:04:00]  That kid's a go-getter.  I'll tell you.  He certainly is.  And Stan knows how to make another man happy, and I like him.  Ricky.  Yes.  What's going on?  Nothing much.  I'm lost.  What do you mean you're lost?  Dude, Eric had told me to make a left out the building and then make a left at the corner.  Yeah.  And going down two blocks, and then the deli going two blocks down.  Right.  Did he happen to mention the Starbucks that you were supposed to go to for me at quarter to six? 
[00:04:30]  Yeah.  I was going to go to the Starbucks last just to keep your coffee fresh, because I'm going to go there first and then wait at the deli, you know?  So where are you now?  I'm still on six.  Forget the Starbucks.  I'm going to have somebody else go.  Now, wait.  Eric, is he near where he's got to be?  Ricky, you're on sixth and what?  And I was down on 58.  He's right there.  Because I was supposed to go north instead of south.  He told me he left.  Here's what you've got to do.  Walk into the middle of the street, face away from traffic, and put your hands over your ears. 
[00:05:00]  Wait, what?  Wait, he's right around the corner?  He's right around the corner.  And he's lost?  He's across the street from where he's standing.  And now, you haven't been to the deli yet?  No, I haven't seen the deli.  All right.  It's a blue awning, you said, right?  Yeah, it's right there.  Wait, you've been gone a half hour, and you're only, like, right around the corner.  Oh.  I don't see.  I see the Manhattan Ocean Club. 
[00:05:30]  Manhattan Ocean Club, Eric?  What?  I don't know where that is.  It's across from Jekyll and Hyde.  Jekyll and Hyde.  It'll cross the street and then up a little bit.  It's right there.  Have you seen Jekyll and Hyde's, the theme restaurant?  Yeah.  Are you in front of Jekyll and Hyde's?  No.  I see it from turning around.  Go back to Jekyll and Hyde's.  All right.  Sex Bagel's running out to find the intern and bring him back home.  If you knew, if anyone that doesn't know Manhattan knew how close he was to us right now, he is right around a corner. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah.  You're right around the corner from us.  It's been a half hour.  Yeah.  Longer.  What are you doing?  Just walking around aimlessly?  Yeah, basically.  I thought, I made the left down to the block and then I thought, okay, maybe I was supposed to leave at the right of the building and to the left of the building.  So then I went back up and I didn't see the deli down there anyway.  The weird part is there's a deli on every corner. 
[00:06:30]  Yeah, but I was told to go to a certain one.  All right.  Yes, Ben?  You hired this guy.  I know.  All right, Ricky.  We're coming to get you.  I have nothing to say.  You're going to rescue him?  Yeah, we're going to rescue Ricky the intern, so.  Bobby and Anthony.  All right.  Ricky's back in the studio.  Why is he just standing here?  Because he got lost going to the microphone.  You all right, Ray?  No, I just once again screwed up.  Feeling a little bad about yourself? 
[00:07:00]  You okay?  It's just, I don't know.  Today I came in thinking I was going to get everything right.  I had everybody orders down and everything and then.  Something just keeps happening, doesn't it?  He can't even look at us.  I'm just too ashamed to look at y'all right now.  Oh, he's too ashamed.  Be ashamed?  It's not a sexual issue.  It's not like we walked in and caught you blowing Ben.  Again?  Yeah.  Exactly.  We understand you had to get the gig.  It's all forgotten. 
[00:07:30]  Oh, my.  You are all right, are you?  You are really upset about this.  Looks like you might cry, Anthony.  It'll be all right.  Cry, cry, cry.  You're going to squirt?  You're going to squirt?  Wow.  It's okay, I guess.  Yeah, it's all right.  I got my coffee finally.  Don't worry about it.  Why do you think it happened this time?  You see, instead of just being ashamed, you've got to assess the situation and kind of say,  why did this happen this time?  So you don't make that mistake again. 
[00:08:00]  So assess the situation.  What happened?  I thought the name of the deli was actually the Blue Awning.  The Blue Awning.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So when you saw a deli that had a Blue Awning but a different name, that confused you.  Yeah.  No, I thought it, yeah.  Yeah.  Are you right now thinking, my God, was that a stupid thing to do?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  There's some people in the other room with their heads in their hands. 
[00:08:30]  Poor Rick and I feel bad because a lot of the time he's walking around and he's probably  like, I'm not going to call in.  I'm going to do it this time.  I'm going to find it.  I'm going to make it through.  Yeah.  Did you notice a lot of time was going by and you were probably thinking to yourself,  uh-oh.  Yeah.  They've got to be talking about where I am.  Yeah.  I'm looking at it and I'm like, oh, crap.  Not done.  Got a little shaken up inside, a little more nerves and kind of threw you for a loop a little  more.  You're kind of stupid.  That's not true, O.B.  Jesus, O.B.  He's kind of stupid, though.  No, he isn't.  He is.  There are certain things that happen that put you in situations that perhaps, you know, 
[00:09:00]  you just didn't pick up on right away.  He's not good with directions.  Some people are not good with directions.  Some people aren't.  I mean, it was in the right direction.  It just didn't see the rest of it.  Dude, all he had to do was take one left and then another left.  Yeah.  Left, left.  Trying to stick up for you.  Left, left.  Knock down his argument.  Jesus.  Left, left, and then look for a blue awning.  That was all he had to do.  I would have to say you're a little slow.  Oh, Jesus.  Just a little.  I would say that.  It's not accurate.  He's a good guy. 
[00:09:30]  All right, Ricky.  Wow.  We look forward to your next mess up, I guess.  Makes for good radio.  Well.  There he goes.  If I was somebody right now, I would open a place up called the Blue Awning.  That's right.  You know, so that way if anyone else gets confused, you get their overflow business.  I don't want to see him dejected.  Sorry.  Too late.  That is one upset individual.  He is really, really down on himself about that screw up. 
[00:10:00]  Right.  Because we have such a group of go-getters that can just, like, they're Johnny on the spots.  You know?  You give them a little mission, they do it.  It's not a problem.  And he's had a couple of problems.  This isn't the first time this has happened.  But this goes back to childhood and the times where, like, he would just be kind of sitting  there in the woods by himself, like, kind of like Henry Fonda in on Golden Pond when  he went to pick strawberries or blueberries.  Looking at the loom. 
[00:10:30]  I got lost.  Poor old codger.  Dopey old man hat with his fishing hat.  And he can't even get a rod to molest the blonde boy that's been spending the summer with  him.  He takes him out on the old boat.  Oh, my goodness.  That's another one of those movies that just makes me laugh really hard when I see it.  When he starts looking around and he realizes he's lost.  Up at the trees, they're so tall and scary.  Yeah, so confusing. 
[00:11:00]  That must have been when it looked like blue awnings and buildings spinning around.  I thought it was the blue awning.  I was lost.  Thank you for the huge banana.  It's not the same vibe.  God.  Bananas got weight to it.  Dude, he doesn't like big bananas.  I hate the big banana.  Mustache guy.  I hate the big banana.  Can you get mustache guy in here?  But, you know, because now I got to peel it and break it up and eat it. 
[00:11:30]  Why don't you explain to the new intern that you don't like the really big bananas?  Is this the only banana they had, sir?  It was a bunch, but I grabbed the first one that came.  First one that came on your hand?  This is a big banana, isn't it?  Do they have any smaller ones?  I think that was about all the sizes they had.  If you want me to go down and get another one, that's cool.  Because sometimes, like Nathaniel, when he has to go, he'll get two smaller bananas.  Because he knows my phobia to big, thick, meaty, nine-inchers. 
[00:12:00]  There's only one way the intern's going to learn.  Anthony needs two small bananas for this one, okay?  Thank you, mustache guy.  I wouldn't send him back.  Yeah, but he's got to learn.  He's got to learn.  And hurry up, because Anthony gets hungry this time of the morning.  And bring me one, too, a big one, but not that one.  Jimmy, hold on, hold on.  Tell him Jimmy's just kidding.  No, I want one.  Is he kidding?  Yeah, he's kidding.  Okay. 
[00:12:30]  Can he hear me out there?  Can he hear me out there?  Yeah, I know, I know.  Is he out the door?  No, he's in the other studio.  Oh, it's taking him so long.  I need my bananas.  He needs his banana.  Hurry up.  Please.  Hey, this is Kid Rock, and you're listening to Opie and motherfucking Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  It's the worst of the interns of the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:13:00]  I am Eric, Sam, Fan, Travis.  You're not all those people.  Yeah.  Sometimes.  When I'm home, I pretend.  I don't blame you.  This predates all of us.  No, I was here for this one.  No, because you didn't work for the show until after me, remember?  I wasn't even here for Ricky.  Yeah.  You really spoke like you had some authority, though.  I know.  I was waiting for somebody to call me on it.  That sucked.  This is from the old days.  Yeah, this is back at N.E.W. 
[00:13:30]  There was this intern named Brian.  Yeah.  One day, Brian showed up to work.  He had an eye patch and a bandage over his head.  Was he totally mentally insane?  Well, this bit kind of leads to that.  Oh, wait a minute.  You guys spoil it?  Yeah.  It sucks.  Everybody thought it was normal.  That's why we're playing it.  It was just some kid showing up to work.  Now we're not going to play it.  Brian wouldn't divulge what happened to him.  All he said was that he was in an accident.  And what ensued?  I guess hilarity. 
[00:14:00]  What did I write?  Did I write anything?  Intense examination ensues.  Ensues.  Yes.  To reveal what was under the bandages, and he wouldn't do so.  I remember hearing this on the radio, and it was funny.  All right, fanboy.  Let's play the bit.  Yeah, I like the show.  I gave the out, so you can cut off where he says, yeah, I like the show.  Perfect.  I'm a fan.  Good job.  Old Sammy show hater is all done.  Let's play it, fanboy.  It's the worst, fanboy and Anthony.  Should we talk about Captain Hook? 
[00:14:30]  You guys hire some weird people, man.  Our intern showed up today with a patch on his eye.  Arr!  And then above the patch on his forehead, a huge bandage.  And he swears that he was in, what, a car accident?  Arr, matey, arr, arr, arr.  But we think he's, like, faking.  There's been, now, now, there's been some speculation as to the validity of your injuries. 
[00:15:00]  Everyone was speculating during the day that, um, wondering if, if it's real.  Because some people have looked under the patch.  I have not looked under the patch and said there's nothing wrong with the eye.  Well, let's get to the story.  What happened?  I got hit by a car.  You look completely ridiculous.  You got hit by a motorcycle.  Yes.  But not you personally, your car.  My car.  Okay, so you're driving.  Driving, making a left-hand turn.  You're making a left.  And the motorcycle decides on going left to me.  He decides to do what?  To pass on my left.  Oh, to pass on your left.  Yes.  So you're making a left, he's passing you on the left, and he runs into what? 
[00:15:30]  My driver's side.  Your driver's side door.  Mm-hmm.  So what happens?  Wait, my, oh, okay.  Yeah.  My head goes through my driver's side window.  Oh, it did?  Yes.  How fast was he going?  Uh, pfff, don't know.  22 miles an hour.  Mm-hmm.  And you're making your left?  Yes.  And he hits your door, your head goes through the window?  Mm-hmm.  Okay.  Yes.  So you hit your head, and what happened to your eye?  Uh, glass got in.  Glass in your eye.  And what happened underneath that patch on your head?  That's, that's where my head went through the windshield. 
[00:16:00]  What kind of injury?  Just, just, just a couple scrapes.  Couple of scrapes.  Yeah, but a hard head.  Anything, any, uh, hospital?  Yes.  You went to the hospital?  Did they stitch your head up or anything?  I stitched my head up a little bit.  Yeah.  Washed out my eye.  Washed out your eye.  Why the patch?  Because, uh, I can't really, I can't really open up my eye, so just.  You can't open it?  No, not, not well, because the glass in the eye.  Kind of hurts.  Yeah, a little bit.  Can we look at the, uh, scratches on your head? 
[00:16:30]  You gotta see this.  No, I hear they can't take it off.  You can't take it off.  I don't want to take it off.  Okay, no, no, I'm still, look, I'm still willing to believe this.  I'm still willing to believe this.  There's innovation over there.  You, so, you, you, you got scratches, but they had to be stitched.  How many stitches did you get?  Three.  Three stitches.  Yeah.  All on one cut, or two on one cut?  No, just all on one cut.  All on one cut.  Three stitches.  Minor, yes.  Is there any way to lift it up to take a look underneath?  If you really, I'd rather not. 
[00:17:00]  I mean, it's, ugh.  All right, Ben, Ben, to you.  I'm sure you take it off out there and rub your eye.  Well, you were, no, no, no, no.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  The bandage on his head.  Well, lift up the patch of the eye.  Yeah, let's look at the eye.  I really can't open up, I showed Rick before, I really can't open up my eye.  I always do.  You just, you can't really.  I mean, she's blinking, that eye's blinking a lot.  Because it bugs the hell out of me.  Oh.  Oh, didn't they get all the glass out?  Yeah, they did, but it scratches.  The scratches still in my eye.  The scratches, huh?  Scratches in your eye. 
[00:17:30]  Yes.  Well, that happens.  The cornea gets scratched open.  Yes.  And it takes time to heal.  And that's the only injuries you had, was the glass in the eye and the stitches above your patch?  Yeah, the only thing that happened was, yeah, my driver's window shattered.  Let's see the stitches.  I really can't.  I'll come in.  Next time I'm here, I'll show you the scar.  You know, it would be totally, no, don't do it, Steve.  You know, it would be tough.  I'll cover my head now.  It's going to hurt.  You know something.  Wait, we've all had stitches.  You could take the.  My doctor told me not to. 
[00:18:00]  I don't want to get infected.  I swear.  No, I'll cover my head now, because I don't trust anybody in the studio.  No, no, don't worry.  No one's going to pull it off.  Yes, they will.  No, no, really.  No one pull it off.  But the thing is, this would totally be resolved just if we saw some stitches.  Because I must say, everyone has been talking behind your back.  What hospital is it?  Northern Westchester.  Northern Westchester.  Okay.  Emergency room.  No, I feel like kind of an idiot.  No, no, don't ever feel like an idiot.  Nobody is looking at me really funny.  Well, just take the patch off.  Show us the stitches, and then we all look like idiots. 
[00:18:30]  But I really would rather not, because I'm a scar.  No, because you might cut yourself against this stuff.  Yeah, that's what I do.  I'm apathetic.  Because it itches because of the scratch.  I think this kid came in with a fake injury, man.  No, come on.  I swear to God.  No, I'm still, I totally am willing to believe you.  When was this accident?  It was by my hometown.  When?  I went Wednesday.  My car.  You guys are willing to listen to me.  All right.  All you have to do is pull down the bandage.  I will show you Wednesday.  And then we look like tools.  All right. 
[00:19:00]  On Wednesday.  We've all had stitches.  All you have to do is go like this.  Show the edge of the stitch and boom.  What's going to happen?  I'll show you on Wednesday.  The stitches aren't going to come out until Wednesday.  All right.  Let him talk.  Now, what happened?  My car.  Steve, you got something on this?  No, I'll let him tell his story.  Your car.  My car, I left a dome light on in my car so my car didn't start because the battery  was dead.  Okay.  And when I got it jumped, I was on the way to the station.  I called when I found out my car was dead.  Okay.  And then on the way to the station?  I accidentally called Steve. 
[00:19:30]  And your whole head went through the windshield?  No, the side window.  No, the side window.  Because the motorcycle hit him on the side, so it threw his head through the side window.  Ben?  No, you know what I love about this, too, is that he can't find to call any of us.  And I love the excuse that our interns all of a sudden have.  I don't know the number.  I'm actually going to be in defense of this, too, because I really, I have trouble calling  because I don't know anyone's but Opie's number.  Mike has a good point on line nine.  Well, let me, we'll go to Mike.  All right.  Mike, what's up?  It's WNAW. 
[00:20:00]  Dude.  Hey.  What happened to the dude on the motorcycle, and why was he out on Wednesday in the snow  and the rain on a motorcycle?  It makes no sense.  It wasn't raining and snowing on Wednesday.  It was scrappy out Wednesday.  It really wasn't.  All right.  What happened to the guy on the bike?  Yeah, what happened to the guy on the bike?  He really just, his, my car was more destroyed than his.  But what happened to him?  Wait, the guy had to go flying.  He really didn't.  We weren't going that fast.  But wait, what happened to him?  He came from, he was just kind of a couple of scratches.  And he left? 
[00:20:30]  Yeah.  Wait, wait, he just, all right.  Hold on, okay, all right, all right, all right, all right.  Hold on, hold on.  I have an accident report.  I'll bring it in next time.  If you guys.  What, you have an accident report too?  Is that fake too?  Yes, that's fake too.  Wow.  I know people in high places.  If you guys will believe.  I think it's a plot for airtime.  Well, it's working.  Let me tell you, it's working.  Now, he hit the door.  Yes.  It was enough for, let me just get this straight.  It's enough force to physically move the vehicle enough that your head, it moved your car enough. 
[00:21:00]  Yes.  Because in order for your head to go through the driver's, the driver's side window, your car has to move to put your head through the window.  It's not your head that moves.  When your head goes through anything, it is the actual vehicle moving into your head.  So he hits your car with enough force to move the vehicle so your head goes through the window.  Yes.  Basic physics.  But nothing happens, and he rides his motorcycle away?  Swear to God.  I have an accident report. 
[00:21:30]  I'll bring it in.  It's not fake.  It's nothing that's fake.  Is your car here?  No.  How did you get here?  Train.  Kevin, what's up?  Hey, listen.  Hey.  This guy is so full of it.  He doesn't want to show you the stitches because he doesn't have any.  I know.  There's no reason in hell.  I work in the emergency room.  There's no reason in hell why he can't show you no stitches if he has them.  Hmm.  And that's like a – where did you get that bandaged?  Dwayne Reed right around the corner.  I actually got a poor cave here.  You guys will believe me.  It's barely on your forehead. 
[00:22:00]  With this one, this one's just very nice.  It's kind of popping up.  We might be able to even look underneath.  And will you agree that maybe you might see some swelling in that area?  You can't tell because the bandage is huge.  But even around his eye.  Jerry.  His head went.  Hey, Jerry.  Hi.  Yay.  I just got into a car accident, and I got 50 stitches across my eyelids, and they didn't  put any bandages on me.  No, it's not on his eyelids.  Oh, no, because –  No, he's got – this is what he's got. 
[00:22:30]  He's got a patch over his eye because he had a little glass in there, and he scratched  up his eye, even though you can't really tell when he lifted up the patch, and then  he has a bandage above the eye where he has some stitches.  A bandage is above the eye.  What make motorcycle is this, sir?  Well, put it this way.  I just received 50 stitches.  It was a Honda.  No one drives Hondas.  It was a –  I drive a Honda.  People drive the Hondas.  So it was a Honda, and he hits the door.  What did he say to you after he hit you?  Are you okay? 
[00:23:00]  Are you okay?  And then he took off.  No.  I mean, he waited around for the police.  He waited for the cops.  All right.  All right.  That's why I have a police report, which I will bring to you next time I'm here so  you guys don't think about it.  All you have to do is show us the bandage.  I don't –  Everyone is like –  Rachel.  Okay.  Yeah.  What's up?  People's heads don't go through driver's side windows.  Well, no.  It can happen.  It can happen.  How would a motorcycle driver drive away if it hit him with enough impact to make  his head –  Well, that's what I'm saying. 
[00:23:30]  A lot more damage would be done to the guy.  And he turned his head so it was head on.  Don't buy it.  No way.  All right.  I got something for him.  Okay.  It looks like you have nice poofy shampooed hair.  Did you take a shower recently?  I washed my head.  I didn't take a shower.  Did you take off the bandage?  No.  I was told not to.  I swear to you.  That's a dry bandage.  But it's not wet.  It's not wet and soggy.  It would be all messy.  I washed my hair off.  That is a brand new bandage.  But wouldn't it come off if it got wet a little? 
[00:24:00]  It hasn't yet.  How can you keep it from getting wet and washing your hair?  Because I put it understated.  Very good question, Opie.  Thank you.  Okay.  Detective Opie.  Let's see.  Take the bandage off.  No, I don't want to.  Anne-Marie.  You've got to take that bandage off.  No, I really would.  I'll cut.  I love this.  Anne-Marie.  Yes.  Hey.  Hi, Brian.  Hi, Anne-Marie.  Hi.  Hey, what happened to him?  Well, I don't know about the accident because I wasn't working whenever he got in the accident.  But I can tell you he's very accident prone.  Hang up, Anne-Marie. 
[00:24:30]  All right.  Hang up the phone.  What's the matter, Brian?  Jesus, I work with her.  Trying to figure this out.  What do you mean he's accident prone?  Oh, my God.  Yeah, fine.  Tell them about the incident.  The other incident.  How many incidents have you had, Brian?  Oh, my God.  And we're on to something.  Tell them about the hot boiling water on my crotch.  You can tell them that story.  Oh, that's true.  Oh, that's right.  You can tell them that.  He's a regular over at the Hudson Valley Hospital.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  He's like, he falls.  Well, you know, like, a lot of people can fall down the stairs, but Brian can actually fall up the stairs and get hurt. 
[00:25:00]  It's like that Munchausen by proxy syndrome, only without a child.  He just does it to himself.  All right.  Hold on, Anne-Marie.  For the attention.  You do that?  What town was this in?  Yorktown.  I live in Yorktown, yeah.  Yorktown.  Okay.  Bill, you work in Yorktown?  No, no, no.  I live in Yorktown.  But listen.  Okay.  I got a friend that's a state trooper.  Yeah.  Was it the state trooper that helped this kid?  Yeah.  Yeah?  I got a friend that's a state trooper. 
[00:25:30]  He would have told me.  He just came on a motorcycle to see me.  He would have told me if there was a motorcycle accident.  Besides, there's so much sand on the roads, especially right after the blizzard, there was no way that anybody's driving a motorcycle around here.  I've seen people drive by.  I have the police report.  I swear to you.  I'll bring it in next time I see you.  All you have to do is take the bandage off.  I don't want to.  What police department?  Like, what area?  Is there any way we can call right now and verify that there was an accident?  What road did it happen on? 
[00:26:00]  What road was it?  What road was it?  It was in Pleasantville.  What road?  What road?  Pleasantville Road.  Dude, you came to work faking an accident, man.  Dude, hold on.  That's scary.  Maybe I'm embellishing it a little bit.  That's scary.  Embellishing a little bit.  All right, now we're getting on to it.  What is embellishing a little bit?  We work with a bunch of freaks around us.  What's embellishing a little bit?  How much is embellished?  Be honest.  No, I really got hit by a motorcycle.  Maybe my head didn't go through the wind.  Was this last year?  All right, all right. 
[00:26:30]  Maybe the head didn't go through the window, so it hit the window.  No, well, I think...  So there's no glass in your eye.  There is glass.  From where?  What broke?  No, my window did break, but my head might not have went through the window.  It might have been his...  Wait, let me...  Mike, Mike, what's up?  How you doing, guys?  I'm going to pay an auto glass for a living.  Yeah.  All right?  It takes almost a hammer to go through a side window.  They're not meant to break.  Right.  This guy must have got creamed if he could have even come close to get his head through a side window.  So you're saying maybe it was the guy, the motorcycle guy's helmet. 
[00:27:00]  Maybe it was...  Maybe it was...  I'm going to call us the car.  But he just drove away?  No, he was fine.  I have the accident report.  I'll give you the guy's number when I get home.  I'll call you.  So then what...  If your head didn't go through, what's on your head?  It was the glass shattered onto my head.  Okay.  All right.  It hits.  Glass shatters on your head.  And it was enough to...  Oh, lift it up.  Lift it up.  Lift it up.  You've got to lift that damn thing up.  You've got to.  I'm dying to see this now.  Lift.  There's got to be...  I really don't want to.  What's under there?  I'm feeling really... 
[00:27:30]  That's the purpose here.  We're working this out.  We're working through it.  We're working with single white male.  I'm telling you.  We're working through this.  He's an effing freak.  Keith the cop.  Oh, my God.  Okay.  We're trying to recreate the accident scene here.  Yeah.  All right.  Here's a cop.  Here's a cop that's been on many...  Yes.  ...details.  Okay.  I've seen many accidents.  So, what you're saying is you're in the left-hand lane attempting to make a left-hand turn?  No.  I'm in my right lane making a left-hand turn. 
[00:28:00]  Making a legal turn.  Okay.  Wait.  You're making an illegal turn then?  No, no.  It's legal.  Are you in the turning lane?  You're going left.  Are you in the...  It's a one-way street.  One lane.  I mean, not one lane.  I'm sorry.  One lane each direction.  Yes.  Okay.  So, it doesn't matter left or right.  All right.  Go ahead.  Okay.  Pleasantville Road.  What university is there?  Quickly.  Quickly.  Case University.  Okay.  All right.  University.  Pleasantville Road.  And you're at an intersection.  What road are you turning on to?  This is a familiar route because you're on your way to work.  I was on my way to work and school and all that.  You take this every day. 
[00:28:30]  So, Pleasantville, you make a left on...  Manville.  Manville.  Manville.  Manville.  Okay.  All right.  Approximately how far back is the motorcycle when you make the turn?  Probably like 20 feet.  And he passes you over the double yellow.  I think what might have happened was that his foot...  What he said was his foot slipped off the brake pedal and he kept going into my car.  His foot slipped off the brake pedal.  He didn't use the handbrake.  Doesn't use that front brake.  So, his foot slipped and he went in.  So, it was just... 
[00:29:00]  So, he's almost like next to you.  Yeah.  And he builds up enough speed to fly into your car and even shatter a window and fly off  his motorcycle so his helmet hits the window.  Just...  How fast were you going?  I was stopped because I was making the turn.  But, I mean, how fast were you going on that road before you came to a stop?  30?  35?  Maybe.  There's no way.  Okay.  I have a conclusion.  I have a conclusion.  Not if this guy runs off his bike like Gary Busey.  Keith the cop.  I have a conclusion.  After being affiliated with the show for almost two years, we have a lack of security. 
[00:29:30]  Because this guy should just not be in...  Who does the screening?  Now, Keith, you've talked to a lot of people that you might be arresting, you might not  be, and you get stories out of them that you could tell right away if they're true or  false.  You're a seasoned cop.  This is really...  This is shaky.  Keith...  You ever watch cops and you see a question in the guy and it's like, this is so...  Like, this isn't panning out.  There should be beads of sweat rolling down this guy's forehead.  Is there?  Let me see.  No.  There is... 
[00:30:00]  I'm fat, so I'm sorry you're listening.  Next time he comes to work, I'd like to see the car.  All right, Keith.  Thank you.  Okay, I have pictures.  Bye-bye.  A lot of people saying you'd be in a neck brace.  Yeah.  What happened to your neck?  Nothing?  Nothing.  Swear to God.  My head may not have went through the window.  All right.  Might not have went through the window.  I have a police report.  All right, so now, like, your head didn't go through the window, so let's see the stitches.  No.  You have no stitches.  No.  We've drawn the conclusion now that you do not have stitches under those bandages. 
[00:30:30]  No, it's not what we want to believe.  We have drawn the conclusion through questioning and working through this that you cannot possibly  have three stitches on any cut under that bandage.  Okay.  You don't, do you?  No.  Okay, fine.  You have scratches.  All right, yeah, right.  You got to be there.  What is it?  It's a scratch.  It's a scratch.  Yes, I just got embellished a little bit.  So you embellished with the stitches.  Then you could take it off.  Did you indeed go to the hospital?  Yes, I did.  Take off the bandage.  You could take it off. 
[00:31:00]  I'm embarrassed, because it's probably not going to be anything there.  Don't even be embarrassed.  Just take it.  Can I see a cut on my finger, too, if you really want?  You can redeem yourself by just being honest.  Take the bandage off, we'll laugh at you, and then we'll move on.  We'll laugh, and we'll move on.  Let's go.  I want to see a cut on my finger that I got from the tube.  Take the bandage.  Just the bandage on your head.  Just the one on your head.  Take the bandage.  You've got to take it off now.  Here it comes.  It's going to hurt.  Let's take it off.  Let's take it.  You see that?  Wait a minute.  Hold on.  Hold on.  All right.  Turn your head.  There's nothing. 
[00:31:30]  Dude, I was honestly expecting maybe a cut.  There's nothing?  There's nothing.  I mean, nothing there.  There's really nothing there?  Dude, there is nothing there.  Holy ass.  There's absolutely nothing.  I am scared for my safety.  People, I can't stress to you enough.  Like, not even.  There's nothing there.  There's not even an abrasion.  There is nothing under that.  I saw the piece.  It went from three stitches to nothing.  A head going to the window, and there's nothing under there.  Because I'm a pussy.  That is skin on the same side of each.  It does not look any different. 
[00:32:00]  Dude, there's nothing.  Nothing hit.  I have a police report.  Okay, get the thing out of my face.  Was it Earl's friend?  Steve's video trailer.  Now let's go phase two here.  Dude, take the patch off.  Take the patch off.  You look ridiculous.  You don't need the patch.  Take the patch off.  Obviously, you didn't have that.  Take the patch off.  Open your eye.  No, I really can't open my eye.  Open your eye.  That is true.  It's not tearing.  It's not red.  It's not red.  The whites of your eye are white.  I can't even open my eye.  How many fingers?  I can see that of my right eye.  I can see five.  Close your right eye.  Open the other eye. 
[00:32:30]  I can't.  Open the eye.  Open the goddamn eye.  There's nothing wrong with your eye.  Please don't do this anymore.  I swear.  You're scaring us.  Open your stupid eye.  Open the eye.  Open the eye.  Single white male.  Open the eye.  There's nothing wrong with it.  You have nothing on your head.  I swear to you there's something wrong with my eye.  There's nothing on your forehead.  You had a huge patch.  There's nothing in your eye.  Saying you couldn't even take the patch off the shower.  There's nothing on your forehead.  Holy S. 
[00:33:00]  That is the best.  Now look.  All right.  It's opening up.  Yeah.  It's opening up a little bit.  All right.  I swear if you guys.  It's opening.  Yes.  All right.  Open it up.  He embellished about the eye.  Open it.  No.  Pull the bottom lid down a little.  That really does hurt.  Well pull it down.  I just want to see if it's red.  Pull the bottom lid down.  Now open the other eye.  I can't open up my eye.  Hold it open.  That really does hurt.  Take the ping.  Hold it open a little.  Hold your eye open.  Just hold it open.  It's.  I want to see if there's any irritate. 
[00:33:30]  Look.  It's totally white.  Dude do you see any red?  I swear it hurts.  There's no red.  Please wear the patch.  Feel free to wear the patch.  Where's my parrot?  Please feel free to wear the patch.  All right.  Look at Hope.  He's freaking out over here.  Hey.  Hope.  Who the hell screams these people?  Not only that.  What's up up in?  Brian is a little weird.  Do you remember the first couple days you showed up to work?  He like brought in pies and was buying us coffee and was just.  Well that's nice.  You want to make a good impression. 
[00:34:00]  I'm not going to delve off into any other directions here that don't have any validity  with this case that we're working on right here.  The injury case.  The injury case.  I have the police report.  I will bring it in.  All right.  We are looking forward to seeing the police report.  All right.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you very much for the frigging half hour radio.  Steve you're not going home early today are you?  No.  Okay.  Not at all.  Steve. 
[00:34:30]  We got to get at least a still picture of the unveiling of the wounds.  Okay.  What were you working on before we pulled you in?  Nothing.  Nothing?  I'm checking out his feedback.  All right.  Okay.  Great.  We'll let you continue ahead on your job.  All right.  You can wear the patch if your eye is hurting a little bit.  Okay.  All right.  Okay.  Thank you very much.  That was great.  Take your bandage with you.  We wouldn't want to get any infections from all the blood on there.  That is great. 
[00:35:00]  What's the matter?  Nothing.  I'm a little hurt.  You're a little hurt?  I feel like an ass, to be honest with you.  Well, you know something?  When you do certain-  Well, open your eye!  And then we can, like, move on.  You're still, like, faking that you can't open the eye.  The thing is, I understand you feel like an ass.  Holy ass.  But when you do certain things, and they don't pan out, and there's consequences, the one  consequence is looking like an ass.  Yes.  So you did this.  Now you move on, and you learn.  That may be embellishing when these things happen.  You said you had stitches.  There's nothing on your forehead.  Nothing at all.  Next time, you fake a knee injury, you wrap it up in an ace bandage, no one could call you 
[00:35:30]  on it.  You just say, it hurt.  I hurt my leg.  But a head wound is like, wow, that's a tough one, because it's right there.  And the patch, even, you know something?  If you adjust the head wound, maybe that way, but then you add the patch, it's a little  much.  Okay.  A little much.  We might have believed it if you just had the patch.  Or the eye patch.  Not both, though.  The both would put it over the top.  But next time, a leg injury, back injury, something you can't really, say, take the 
[00:36:00]  bandage off.  Jay, dude, stop talking to this guy.  Call security.  Hide behind something.  You'll never see a freaking accident report.  He's lying.  He's a psycho, bro.  All right?  Thank you.  Wait, wait, wait.  He says he feels like an ass.  That's because he's busted.  Now he's about to strike.  You're not going to strike, are you?  I have a hand.  I feel like a hand.  All right.  Can we check his clothes and stuff?  For real.  You're not going to go crazy, are you?  Dude, he is, man.  Get rid of him.  All right.  Do you own any guns?  No guns.  Do you have any guns on you? 
[00:36:30]  No.  Do you have any needles in your pocket?  Okay, let's frisk them over.  I'm not going to get stuck in here, am I?  Thanks and beans.  Can we check his clothes for weapons?  I don't think he's carrying any weapons, Opie.  You thought he had stitches.  No, we didn't think he had stitches.  But, you know, I would think he was just trying to garner a little sympathy.  Excuse for the day off.  All right.  We can move on now.  All right.  Thank you very much.  You can go back to whatever.  And don't feel too bad, you know. 
[00:37:00]  You pay, you know.  You do something.  It doesn't pan out.  You pay.  Now you'll forever be the eyepatch guy.  What good message board name could it be?  Captain Psycho.  Captain Psycho.  I'm honored.  All right.  All right.  Well, continue with looking at instant feedback.  Thank you.  Thank you.  With your good eye.  You can turn around and there you go.  There you go.  There he goes. 
[00:37:30]  Out the door.  Watch.  Don't hit your head with the door.  That would hurt.  Lock that studio door.  Holy S.  Where the hell are you firing these people?  That was great.  Opie and Anthony.  So you guys are like, I'm uncomfortable.  You've got to be a little sympathetic, Opie.  I mean, there's a reason that he's doing this, you know.  I'm not out here to save the world and stuff, but I kind of know there's some kind of reason  that it's going on.  And Anthony, there was a reason why Joel Rifkin did what he did.  I know.  That's what I'm saying.  I'm saying I'm not getting behind him. 
[00:38:00]  There was a reason why that kid shot up the school in San Diego.  Absolutely.  And it was because when he lied one time or something, people just jumped on him, maybe.  People are tuning in halfway through going, what the hell is going on?  It went from an A-team type crash.  Summarize what happened.  Well, Opie.  Our intern came in today.  Yeah.  What's his name?  Brian.  It's Brian.  He came in.  He had a big bandage on his forehead. 
[00:38:30]  Huge.  Huge.  Yeah, very big bandage.  It took up half his forehead.  On his forehead.  And an eye patch over the left eye, his left eye.  Claiming he had an accident with a car and a motorcycle.  He was making a left.  So he went out to get coffee or something.  And we all started whispering in the back office.  We're like, holy yes.  The guy's faking.  It just didn't seem legit.  Didn't add up.  Didn't add up.  He was trying to get off of work, I think, or an excuse for not coming in. 
[00:39:00]  Because he didn't show up Wednesday.  Is that it?  Yeah.  So basically he should be fired.  But he had an excuse.  And the excuse was that he was in this accident.  Yeah.  Hence the patch on his eye and the big, huge bandage on the forehead.  And the big bandage on his head.  And people were calling him on it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  In the office.  We were talking.  And then we decide we'll just go on the air and hash it out.  Well, he comes in and says he was making a left.  A motorcycle was going straight around him.  They crashed.  His head went through the driver's side window, cutting his head, requiring three stitches in the ER, Opie. 
[00:39:30]  And he had glass in his eye, which scratched the cornea.  And that's what the eye patch was for.  After some questioning about some things that didn't quite pan out.  But he fessed up that he might have been embellishing.  Everyone's in the studio.  He might have been embellishing.  He's the only one outside the studio now.  And that door's locked.  Freaked out.  So he said he might have been embellishing the story. 
[00:40:00]  Who comes up with this crap?  He wouldn't take the bandage off his eye.  Off his head.  Off his forehead.  He wouldn't take the bandage off.  No one's going outside.  So no work's being done.  He said he didn't want to get infected.  He was lying right there standing in front of us.  So saying, I can't take it off.  It'll get infected.  My doctor said no.  When we finally did get him to take the bandage off because he fessed that he was embellishing  and his head did not go through the window.  Just some glass broke from the motorcycle guy's helmet hitting the window or whatever. 
[00:40:30]  He got cut.  We wanted to see the cuts.  He finally said he was embellishing.  Took the bandage off.  Opie, there was not even a ding.  There wasn't a scratch where if you scratched yourself on your head because he had an itch,  there wasn't even that red that you had.  I have more of a mark on my face.  You probably noticed today from a watch cloth because I scrubbed too hard.  Look.  Over here.  Right.  He doesn't even have that.  I can't stress to how much of a mark there was nothing.  Nothing.  And then the eye patch comes off. 
[00:41:00]  He was blinking real hard with that eye saying that there was glass in it even though there  wasn't glass.  But the eye started loosening up and he's not blinking.  And he can't keep it closed anymore.  He pulled down the bottom of the eye and there was no red at all.  No red in the eye.  So obviously.  So it went from a major car accident to he made up the story because he missed Monday  and Wednesday and now no one wants to leave the studio to work.  It was a story. 
[00:41:30]  Let's go back to Anne-Marie.  Anne-Marie.  Yes.  Hey.  How you doing?  All right.  Well, I could tell you that Brian probably when he gets hurt, see what happens is he's  kind of afraid that it's going to be worse than it really is.  Anne-Marie, he wasn't hurt at all.  Oh, but I bet you he thinks he was.  I wouldn't put it past him.  I bet you he poked himself in the eye a couple times before he came to work.  No, he didn't do it on purpose.  But he gets like, he's very tender. 
[00:42:00]  Right.  You know what I mean?  Like if he gets like a headache, you know, he's got a brain tumor.  Oh, like a hypochondrius kind of thing?  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  But that's.  Yeah, and we call him Briar the liar.  Oh, what do you call him?  Briar the liar.  Because he exaggerates a lot?  A little bit, yeah.  Jesse?  Yeah.  Do you remember when he said he had to take a day off because he had surgery on his head  or his brain or something?  No, it was his foot.  What?  What?  It was his foot?  He said his brain. 
[00:42:30]  You're right.  He said he had surgery on his head.  All right, let's go.  Get Briar.  Briar, what happened?  What happened when?  You had surgery.  On my ankle, yes.  On your ankle.  Yes, that was true.  And that was true.  Now nothing I'm going to say.  Well, now you know what it is.  It's the boy that cried wolf thing.  You can't blame us now for not believing certain things.  Earl.  You've set this.  Earl, stay in here.  Steve, stay in here.  Now, what happened to your leg?  To your ankle?  I tore my leg.  What happened?  I tore my ligaments playing basketball.  Playing basketball. 
[00:43:00]  And you got an operation done.  It doesn't look like you're too active.  Do you have a scar on your ankle?  Is there an operation scar there?  Yeah.  On my knee, yeah.  All right, let's see.  Who's playing basketball?  Michael Jordan.  Brian, you told me it was when you tripped.  I thought you said ankle.  I thought you just said ankle.  Wait, I thought you just said ankle.  You said ankle.  All right.  That was your knee.  Wait, where's the scar?  How long ago was this done?  My surgery scar was done a while ago. 
[00:43:30]  But my knee.  But what's the recent one?  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Guys, when was this?  When was this?  Do you remember when you guys made a quick comment that someone tripped over the door?  Right.  Right.  Brian, I remember that.  And you said you came in and you said you had to have, like, your ankle.  You, like, tore a ligament or something.  I didn't tore a ligament from that.  I don't need to be ratting you out.  You want to see my...  I'm not trying to rat you out.  Where is the surgery scar that you had from this recent operation that was two weeks ago?  It was orthoscopic, so you're not familiar to see.  I swear. 
[00:44:00]  Hold on.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  It was orthoscopic.  So...  Right here.  What do you got?  It's a mole.  It's a mole!  It's a mole?  Oh, my God.  I can't take this.  It's not a mole.  I can't take this.  Okay.  And this therapy is where?  It's in... 
[00:44:30]  Peekskill.  Sorry.  Pleasantville again.  No, Peekskill.  And what do they do to help you out?  They put me on different machines.  Although I'm not very active, as Opie said.  They put me on machines that make me...  On machines?  Yes.  Because your ankle...  What do they say is actually wrong?  I tore ligaments.  You tore ligaments.  Yes, a lot of them.  So now you, like, walk and do things.  Treadmill or something.  Treadmill, they make me answer for machines.  Okay.  But there's no scar.  No.  It's amazing.  It's new, Serge.  All right.  Where's...  Bring Jesse in here. 
[00:45:00]  Pathological Brian's a new nickname.  Coming in from Mark from the Bronx.  Get everyone in here.  So, okay.  Okay, you had that surgery.  Yeah.  But it was nothing with your brain or your head?  What was that, Jeff?  You said...  See, Ben...  I don't remember exactly because it wasn't, like, a big deal.  But you said you couldn't come in one Friday.  I don't mean...  I feel bad because I'm like...  Oh, whatever.  It's cool.  You said you had, like...  You needed surgery on your head.  On your brain? 
[00:45:30]  No, no.  That was Rick making a joke about me.  He said I needed a lobotomy.  No.  Oh.  No, no.  You said it to me that you had head surgery.  I never said I had head surgery.  Now this is getting...  And then Rick said that.  Brian, Brian, when you make a joke, that means it's not real.  All right, well...  Oh, my goodness.  See, I missed work one day.  All right, here's the deal.  There's a lot of people very uncomfortable right now.  So we're going to have a little vote.  What are you going to vote?  Who wants Brian to go home today? 
[00:46:00]  What?  I'm not voting that.  He lied.  Try to your face.  Who cares?  I'm fine with it.  I don't care.  I think it made for a great radio.  What, you want to toss a diamond in the rough like this out the door?  No, I said go home today.  Today?  Yeah.  No.  I think he's doing a great job.  Thank you, I think.  Come on, you're going to get more stories if we live.  This is great.  If we live.  Hands up.  Who wants him out?  Today.  Today?  No.  I think I'll put my hand up, too. 
[00:46:30]  Oh, you want to go home today?  Steve, take care of the eye?  I'm cool with it.  I'm big.  You're cool.  Well, you're big, and you know how to handle yourself.  I don't care.  He's not going to do anything to faze me.  There's only three people that want him to leave?  No one's being honest.  Let's be honest.  Get out of the room.  I'm being honest.  I think it's fine.  I'll turn my back, and I'll put my hands against the wall for you guys.  All right, turn your back, because maybe someone doesn't want to see that they're voting.  Oh, a secret ballot?  All right, who wants him to leave?  Yeah, look, four votes are going up right now.  Four and four.  I had mine up before. 
[00:47:00]  I just didn't see it.  Earl, it's to you.  The deciding vote.  Earl, the vote.  Jesus Christ.  No way.  The man that can't do anything right.  Earl's not going to vote him off the island.  That's his brother, man.  Earl still thinks he's a virgin.  Earl, I like you.  I can't believe you guys wanted to stay today.  Why not?  I feel bad.  Screw feel bad.  I'm still an intern.  I didn't want you to vote me out. 
[00:47:30]  Kids effed up.  Why did you do it?  Can we ask that?  We really haven't asked the why.  Why did you go through this elaborate accident scheme?  Intimidation.  What do you mean?  Everyone had a story on the show and you figured you needed one?  Yeah, sure.  No, not as much.  What intimidation?  Wait, you are intimidated?  I'm intimidated by this show.  You're intimidated.  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Before you get into this?  Yeah.  Because it is a tie.  It's four that want him to go, four that want him to stay. 
[00:48:00]  I'm telling you, we're going to the listeners.  I'm sorry.  I'm screwed.  Clear the phone lines.  Is he holding it up to you?  One, two, three, four, five, six, two, four.  Okay.  We got nine phones ringing.  And that's what's going to decide it.  I still got to know.  Was there ever an accident?  Yes, there was.  Was it in the last calendar year?  Yes, it was.  It was.  See, now I can't even believe that.  I can't.  Now I can't believe.  Bring in the accident report.  I'll wind up.  And I interrupted you.  Go ahead.  Say what you have to say.  You were saying you were getting.  Oh, you're intimidated by the show.  Yes. 
[00:48:30]  Now why is, I'm sure anybody, Jess, when you first came here, it was a little rough, a  little intimidating.  Yeah.  All right.  And how did you deal with it?  I'm still dealing with it.  What are you guys talking about?  But you just come in.  You do your job.  You hang out.  You get your barbs in where you can.  You kind of, you mix it up with us.  No, like you just don't say any.  I would wait until you guys would talk to me.  And I didn't bring food.  But that was a nice gesture.  You're just pretending, my friend.  That was a nice gesture.  But now, how did you feel this was going to help you? 
[00:49:00]  Because I felt like if I didn't come up with, because if I didn't elaborate on my injuries  that you guys wouldn't believe me, which I guess.  Well, yeah, you put you over the top there.  Kind of kicked me in the ass there, huh?  But why did you come up with the story at all?  It wasn't a story.  It really didn't.  I mean, what?  No, it's a story.  You don't have stitches.  Okay, that is a story.  But the accident was true.  Take the patch off your stupid eye.  Take the patch off.  God.  I'm not going to play along now.  Take the patch off. 
[00:49:30]  My eye really does bother me.  I really can't take off a patch.  His eye bothers him, Opie.  You guys are all insane.  Don't even, you know.  I have a scratched cornea.  If you shine a light in the person's eye, it kills.  Yeah.  If you don't want to do that, do you?  We're starting the voting.  Okay?  The listeners will decide.  I'm packing up as we speak.  Oh, Dave.  Yeah.  Have you heard the last hour of radio?  Yeah.  Okay, what do you think?  I think the guy's a pathological liar.  I think you've got to get rid of him. 
[00:50:00]  All right.  Get rid of him.  All right.  Thank you, Dave.  Take care.  This is one bell.  Stinky.  Make sure Stinky keeps track.  Okay.  Let's go to Mike.  Mike?  Mike?  I'm sorry, man.  This guy's crazy, but he's funny.  See, that's what I'm saying.  All we want to know is should we, you know, send him home today, right now?  No, no.  This is way entertaining, man.  I'm listening.  All right.  Stay.  Thank you.  Let's go to another Mike.  Mike?  Keep him there because two words, Ted Kaczynski. 
[00:50:30]  Thank you, Mike.  Have you been known to be violent at any time?  No, I'm a very sweet guy.  Very sweet.  And he's a liar.  That's what they said about Joel Rifkin.  No, and so you don't have any aggression or anything?  You guys are insane.  Everyone says that one day I might just, you know, snap.  Oh, good.  So let's just keep him around.  You're insane, Anthony.  And there's no gag anymore.  I can't believe you guys want him here after what we just heard.  Oh, wait.  Earl's raising his hand now.  Yeah, but it doesn't matter because you were a pussy when we needed you. 
[00:51:00]  So now the listeners are going to decide.  Troy?  Yeah.  Hey.  Keep the guy, man.  See, everybody's thinking.  F you all.  The sympathy vote.  I love it.  F you all.  Let's go to Jerry.  Jerry.  Fire him.  He's a fairy.  Fire him?  Yeah, fairy.  He's a fairy.  Fire him.  All right.  Okay.  We're running out of votes here.  Let's go to Frank.  Frank?  What's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey, now I know why my instant feedback's never getting on the air anymore.  Fire his ass. 
[00:51:30]  Fire his ass.  It's 3-3.  All right, guys.  Bye-bye.  Three votes to go.  Mark from the Bronx saying he should have used the Chewbacca defense quickly.  That it's just so ridiculous that you must have quit.  Jeremy.  Hey, guys.  Hey, Dom.  Hey.  I'd say keep him.  You guys suck.  No, that was a keep.  Please, no, don't let him leave today.  It's only 5 o'clock.  That leaves him two hours to come back with weapons.  Michael.  Yeah.  Hey, what do you think?  I think he should go.  All right.  He's like the guy at the ski lodge with the fake cast.  Okay. 
[00:52:00]  Thank you.  All right.  It comes down to the one final vote.  Here it is.  Don't let me down.  Wayne?  Yeah, that's me.  All right.  How are you doing, O.A.?  You will decide Brian's fate.  Honestly, I know his doctor before I vote.  What?  I know his doctor.  You knew his doctor?  I know his doctor.  I can verify for it all.  Conflict of interest on the voting, but.  Oh, but it's Bones McCoy.  Bones McCoy.  Wait a second.  Hold him.  He knows anything that's wrong with him before he comes into work. 
[00:52:30]  All right.  Very funny.  You just saved your ass.  All right.  Wayne, it's.  I think keep the nut.  You.  Oh.  Thank you, Wayne.  You know, maybe put one of those security bracelets on him so you know where he is all  the time.  Can I take off my patch now?  He stays.  Keep on your patch?  I mean, you got a stoker patty that, you know, is still around.  So now you're going to admit that the patch is fake and you want to take it off now?  No, that was a joke.  I'm sorry.  Oh.  Wayne, thank you.  You let me down and I was going to give you something for voting him out. 
[00:53:00]  You're going to give me something to vote him out?  No, now I can't.  You voted to keep him.  Brian, I'd appreciate it if you didn't look me in the eye or even don't even come 20 feet  away from it.  Don't even enter the studio for the rest of the show.  Okay.  This the show?  Okay.  I can do that.  And do not be in the office after the show's over.  Uh-oh.  Until I leave for the train.  It's like Michael Corleone and Rado.  You're not to look at me.  You're dead to me. 
[00:53:30]  Wow.  I'm going to slowly back out of the studio now.  This is, uh...  You guys let me down, man.  What's the matter, Ope?  You don't like the...  You're saying you love the psycho factor.  Every time something happens, you go, I love the psycho factor.  We just got an hour of psycho factor.  Now it's like hit the street.  Oh.  What?  There he comes.  What?  Come on.  What?  You don't find this very entertaining on a very psychotic level? 
[00:54:00]  You don't have to deal with them.  Look at these guys.  Look at Sticky and Jess.  They don't even want to go...  You don't even want to go outside the studio now.  We're never going to talk to them again.  You're the talent, guys.  You know?  We're not the talent.  No, the problem is it's the Opie and Anthony show.  I want him to go and I want him to stay.  Then we went to all you guys.  It was four and four.  Then we go to the listeners.  And the listeners let us down.  Or my side, anyway.  I saw your point.  Are you happy?  No.  This sucks.  Get him home.  He's a friggin' freak. 
[00:54:30]  Thank you.  That is mental.  That whole story we just heard is beyond psycho factor.  That's mental.  All right.  Send him home for the day.  We can't.  And then we will...  No, we can't.  We'll talk about it.  No, we can't.  Why?  We did it the fair way.  Oh, I know we did it the fair way.  I'll accept the results.  I'm just pissed.  I'm pissed at the results, but I'll accept them.  Well, the voting should be whether he should be fired or not.  We don't need good radio that bad is all I'm going to say. 
[00:55:00]  Make him...  Look at this guy checking in.  Make him wear the patch as long as he still works there, no matter how long it is.  Like, he's always got to come in now with that patch.  If he doesn't, he goes home.  Yeah, tell him that.  No, I'm serious.  He's got to wear the patch always, man.  No, the day he shows up without the patch, I swear to God, you've got to send him right  home.  No joke.  Tony, what's up?  Oh, before you start ripping on me, I agree you should have sent him home today.  I tried.  But, dude, this kid has got problems, bro. 
[00:55:30]  And, dude, we've listened to your stories about your family.  Yeah.  Dude, my friend's pregnant wife works with your brother, Quinn.  You think after hearing Friday's show, she didn't look at him in a different way?  Wait a minute.  First of all, first of all.  Dude, I agree, bro.  You're also yelling at me.  I've never faked an injury.  I know you have.  No one in my family faked an injury for sympathy.  All right?  Bro, nobody's questioning your integrity, bro.  But this kid has got problems. 
[00:56:00]  He needs a nap ski.  Maybe a permanent one.  Oh, thank you, Tony.  Not you, Toad.  The kid.  No, I heard you.  Dude, man.  I don't know.  Later, dude.  All right, Tony.  Hey, snowing you, brother.  Tuttle from New York.  Final test.  Does Brian like Huey Lewis and the news?  Look at my business card.  The color is bone.  All right.  Look, see, you're all uncomfortable.  No, this isn't going to work.  He's got to go home today.  Oh, I...  Because...  No, because, like, Michael...  Here, Michael...  Now you're all uncomfortable.  Michael on line two.  Ope, change your diaper. 
[00:56:30]  Opie.  Yeah.  What's your problem?  We're a grown man.  We're not...  Because the kid is effed up.  Opie.  Not even in a good way.  Not even in a way we could, like, exploit on the radio.  Who cares?  You could take him down, all right?  I saw you on XFL.  I mean, you're not some little small wimp.  Who cares?  He's not going to shoot anybody.  He doesn't know how to bandage himself.  So what?  See, now Ann wants to send him home.  But you know what?  Ann, stick to your word.  Keep him.  He's entertaining. 
[00:57:00]  I'm just saying, if it's going to interfere with the show, then he's got to go home.  No, see, I'm not happy with the decision we made, but we made the decision.  I have to live with that.  That's fine.  Yeah, but you're crying about it.  Who cares?  Michael...  Keep him away.  Michael, the guy had a bandage on his forehead, claiming he had three stitches.  After about an hour, he finally took the bandage off.  Guess what?  There wasn't even a scratch.  Isn't that a little mental?  Does he have a Jeffrey Dahmer look to him, or what?  At least out of one eye?  Did you see it?  I mean, come on.  You're sitting here whining about this for 20 minutes.  Move on. 
[00:57:30]  All right, we'll move on.  Thank you.  Okay.  If I was him, I would leave on my own, out of embarrassment.  Hey, tell him to go home.  What?  Tell him to go home.  Oh, you're not going to make me do that.  Oh, I will, but then the listeners will lash out at me.  Call me a crybaby.  It comes from you.  They'll go, okay, cool.  Tell him to go home.  I can't do that.  Come on.  What am I?  Tell him to go home.  Tell him to go home and not to come back. 
[00:58:00]  Now, get out of here.  Come on.  That's not my job.  I don't hire and fire.  Oh, see.  Look, I already spelt out how I feel about this.  Look, if I'm not looked at as a crybaby, I'll do it right now.  No problem.  Ah, I can see.  You know what?  I don't really care what people think of me.  Get him in here.  Yeah, make sure he doesn't go in the studio.  Bri.  Yes.  You're outside the studio about what?  He's 20 feet from you.  Right. 
[00:58:30]  That's what I asked you.  So, for the first time, you're following rules.  The Ovi restraining order.  Bri, you're making a lot of people uncomfortable.  I can tell.  I'll leave you on the table.  That's okay.  I understand.  What?  What?  I understand.  You understand that?  Yeah.  We don't know if we want you back, though.  What?  Are we going to lie?  That would suck.  Well.  Do you understand there has been a breach of faith here? 
[00:59:00]  Don't you find it a little weird, the whole thing?  You're still wearing the patch and you don't even have an eye injury.  I do have an injury, though.  That's what you don't understand.  But very injury.  You said you had an injury on your forehead.  There's not even a scratch.  My head was smashed apart and I lost my shoes.  So, uh.  You're about 19 feet away.  Okay.  Yeah, move back.  Thank you.  God damn it.  You're awful.  So mean.  I'm mean.  The guy scared.  Shut up.  No, I see where you're coming.  Shut up, Jess. 
[00:59:30]  Opie, you're 100% right.  Stank, am I right?  You are.  Ben, am I right?  100%.  Thank you.  200%.  You're not going to ask me?  I don't care.  I know you don't care.  That's all right.  These are good cookies.  Who wants them to come back?  Wow.  That hurts.  You're calling sick half the time anyway.  Is this going to crush you?  Uh, not that much, but it will. 
[01:00:00]  A little bit, because I like you guys.  Aw.  I mean, I tried my hardest when I was here.  Ugh.  I mean, this is.  Be tough, be tough.  I'm talking to myself.  Um.  I don't know what I'm talking to myself.  God.  Would we have to worry about you coming back here and shooting everybody?  I like being blunt with this thing.  Now, is there anything that might happen?  You're going to shoot everyone?  No.  No, no.  No shooting going on.  Stab?  No.  You can still listen to us through the radio and stuff.  Let's see how things go. 
[01:00:30]  Can you step back a little bit?  Hello.  I think he sounds fine to me.  I don't foresee any problems with him coming back.  So, Brian, why don't you, you know.  You're not going to kill anybody, though, right?  No, nobody's going to be dead.  All right.  No threats, no, uh, no threatening emails or anything?  Nothing at all.  What?  Nothing at all.  Nothing at all.  Press on the message.  Did you sign something?  Yeah.  When you started working here?  Yeah.  Okay.  That you're not to kill anybody?  Yeah, I didn't read the fine print, but I guess so.  I think that was in there. 
[01:01:00]  Brian, I'd feel safer if you weren't around.  You know, it comes from this, uh, breach in faith.  We all trust each other here, and we don't lie to each other, and then when a lie is made  like that, we're like, hey, where does it end?  You know what I mean?  Okay.  Oh, I'm the guy.  You just made me the guy.  I just said that.  I've gotten that speech before.  Oh, no, you be the guy.  I'm going to go back to my cookies.  I don't care.  And beer.  Hang out.  Cookies and beer.  I'm fine.  We'll leave the door jar.  We'll revisit this.  You're not fired.  You're on what we call a permanent layoff. 
[01:01:30]  Oh, I've been laid off.  Why don't you, uh, show Brian the door?  Oh.  What?  Ben's not happy.  You're not happy.  Brian, any final thoughts?  Oh.  Oh, God.  Hey, you want to make a statement?  Uh, it's been real.  Do you feel this is justified?  Somewhat.  If I, if I brought in the, uh, police report, would you guys still, uh, think I'm BSing to me? 
[01:02:00]  Oh.  Well, I have a problem with the, the stitches that weren't there.  Yeah, even if you are in some kind of an accident, like, the stitches not being there is a little weird.  Okay.  All right, well, we got to take a break, Brian, so thank you.  Well, mate, you know something.  What?  Send them home today.  And then let's really discuss this, because, you know, you know what it is.  Come on.  Have a little, you know, compassion.  I have compassion.  I just, I, I feel bad somewhere inside.  How old a guy are you? 
[01:02:30]  20.  He's 20.  You didn't F up, tell a few wacky stories when you were 20?  Single white female territory.  It's weird if we, if I could figure out why you did it.  I really still don't understand why you would do it.  Is it, is there some kind of, uh, an issue you got?  Are there, are there issues?  It's hard to scream across the studio, but, uh, it's, it's a matter of being really afraid of you guys and being intimidated.  You're, you're 19 feet away.  Isn't it a tension thing?  No.  You don't crave attention? 
[01:03:00]  No.  Maybe?  No?  Hmm.  Dude, you look ridiculous.  You're standing there with an eye patch that you probably don't need.  Oh, probably.  He's warming up to you.  All right.  We got to move on with the show.  Okay.  So, look, you go home for the rest of the day because he, he, he can't think.  Yeah.  Under these circumstances.  And, uh, then we'll get back to you on the long term of this.  Sure.  I just want to see it.  All right.  That's all.  And it's just letting you off the hook lightly.  No, I'm not.  I'm really interested to see if I'm...  You'll get the phone call tomorrow.  Oh. 
[01:03:30]  Look at the axe.  Oh.  Thanks.  Look, I don't care.  I want to see it.  That's all.  Thank you, Brian.  Thank you, Brian.  For your service to this fine radio show.  Let's, uh, take a break, regroup, and do, uh, something different.  You got all the tact of a rake.  Bobby and Anthony.  Your bananas are here.  Oh, my bananas are here.  Let me see.  All right.  Are these keepers?  Oh.  Hey, I think he did a good job.  See how bananas.  See how those bananas don't look like, you know, huge schlongs. 
[01:04:00]  Huge schlongs.  I like them to look like adolescents.  Yeah.  So he still gets the nutritional value of one big one, but he doesn't look weird eating  it, so that's...  Yeah, but it doesn't hurt going in.  So there you go.  And, uh...  Thank you.  No problem.  I got to thank Nathaniel.  Why?  Why do you have to thank Nathaniel?  The second decision in helping.  What?  Oh, he told you where to go?  Yeah, I kind of cheated in a little bit, but, you know, I had to call him up for a split-cision.  Split- split...  Oh, my God.  A split-cision?  A split-cision. 
[01:04:30]  A split-cision.  Yeah.  A split-cision?  Yes.  Oh, okay.  So thanks to Nathaniel for the split-cision.  Why are you carrying that in your pocket?  Oh.  That big banana.  They wouldn't take it back.  Oh, they wouldn't take the big banana back?  Leave it here.  But I need you to, uh...  I want a bagel.  A covered bagel with a little bit of cream cheese, please.  Where are you going to send them for the bagel with cream cheese?  Where are you going for cream...  Where are you going?  Don't go to that place downstairs.  I hate that place.  No, no.  I don't go to pick a bagel.  I get sick there once.  Yeah.  Food poisoning.  Um, Starbucks?  I don't like their bagels. 
[01:05:00]  They're never soft enough.  Uh...  Hmm.  Um...  Let's go...  Give me a bagel.  Get it.  There's a deli on, uh...  On 7th and, like, 56 that has good bagels.  Cream cheese on the side.  7th and 56?  Right around there, yeah.  It's right...  But don't get one right around here, man.  Seriously, I don't like these.  All right, Eric, make sure he's, uh...  He's leaving the unit.  Make sure he knows, too.  Oh, my God.  It's 90...  It's 10 degrees out.  It's 10 degrees out. 
[01:05:30]  Oh, boy, you would be really good at being a prick, man.  Yeah.  You would be really good at it.  I can't even...  I can't even do that.  I'm just hoping that the cold will freeze that awful little cancer mustache off.  Doesn't he look like Babu from the Seinfeld episodes?  Oh, that's what it is, yeah.  Babu.  Oh, Babu.  You're a bad man, Jerry.  Hey, this is Bob Saget.  Yeah, Michelle's dad on Full House.  I fuck Kimmy Gibbler. 
[01:06:00]  You're listening to Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Well, you're listening to The Worst Of.  We're featuring the former...  Well, yeah, former interns.  I guess there's a couple current interns on this, too.  But the interns are the Opie and Anthony show throughout history.  And, uh, Travis, this is probably one of your favorite bits of all time.  It involves balls.  Okay, well, see, I was throwing it to you, and you did it to yourself.  Actually, it does involve balls.  I know what it involves. 
[01:06:30]  It's, uh...  Former interns, but now employees.  Derek and Danny were in the office one night.  Butt-fucking.  No, Steve, that's not what happened.  That's exactly what happened.  No, we're not playing your dreams.  Yeah.  This isn't the worst of Steve's dreams.  That would be the best of my dreams.  So, uh...  Yeah, Derek and Danny, they were in the office one night.  Drunk.  And, uh...  A bit intoxicated, would you say?  Yeah, I'll say.  Well, where'd that lead?  Well, they decided to play with the Paltalk cameras, which led Derek to showing his balls.  And they were massive. 
[01:07:00]  They were huge.  Uh, also, Danny's mom was in attendance.  Yes, and Danny held up some horrific signs to the Paltalk camera.  Which I think we've had to edit out of this bit.  Oh, trust me, they're awful.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And you can see Derek's balls with a big watermark on foundrymusic.com.  You certainly can.  Sight sucks.  So, I want to know what the hell happened last night with the office cam.  Um, all right, well...  All I know, I'll give you my side of this. 
[01:07:30]  Uh-huh.  I walked into work, and I saw a crew that just looked really hungover.  A crew that looked like they haven't slept.  Yeah.  Ben's like, oh, wow, after the show, we all decided to go out and drink.  But it seemed like it went all night long.  All night long, uh, I guess the, uh, the interns and Ben, uh, did a little of that drinking.  Had a little fun drinking.  And it ended up here, at the studio, and, uh, in the office. 
[01:08:00]  And I just got this email from, uh, somebody.  I don't know if I should say who it was, but it just said,  Check out the office cam.  So, I, I punch it up.  And, uh, the second it comes on, uh, I just see a man's ass in full view, fully zoomed in,  uh, with cheeks spread and asshole just gaping.  Ooh.  There was gaping, male ass gaping going on in the, uh, in the office last night. 
[01:08:30]  An ass cave for everybody.  Ass cave, male ass gaping.  And, uh, see, I, I got something set up, uh, between my home computer and my computer  here at work.  I can access either of them from either computer.  Totally.  So, you could turn on this one, too?  No, I don't have this, uh, the studio one.  That would be cool if you could turn that one on every once in a while.  Yeah, it's something to do with the problem with the corporate computer.  You can't load the proper software. 
[01:09:00]  Is it true the office camera's on all the time now?  Yeah, well, uh, some, sometimes it gets shut off, but I can turn it on from home.  Uh, that is unless somebody shuts the computer here off or trips over it or vomits or pisses  on it.  I don't know what they did last night, but I couldn't access it after a while.  And we were having a fight.  This is, like I said, I can access the computer.  So, my, my work computer desktop shows up on my home desktop, and I can click on all  the icons and work anything I want. 
[01:09:30]  I could also type in, if I log on to PalTalk under one of the names, let's say Ope Ant 1  in the office, I type in and I'm Ope Ant 1.  I punch up my camera and it's the camera from the office, but I'm home typing in whatever  I want.  Uh, if some drunk intern or worker is in here, uh, and they sit down, they could type  in, all of a sudden I'll see what they're typing before they even post it.  And then they'll hit return, and under the same name now, there's two different people 
[01:10:00]  posting.  So, uh, um, like I said, I log on, I'm looking at, at man ass, trying to figure out who it  is, uh, slowly backs away, and there I see.  All right, hold on.  How do you figure out whose it is?  Well, I couldn't.  I mean, come on.  I couldn't at first.  Well, it's very easy.  Danny's is a little hairier.  Um, I would say Derek's is more supple.  I, uh, I couldn't figure out whose it was.  So, what I immediately did.  You kind of stepped into something there, though. 
[01:10:30]  Yeah, yeah, I did.  Because you said all you saw was man ass.  All I saw was man ass.  And then you were trying to figure out whose it was.  Uh, yeah, yeah.  Well, you say you have to have some kind of smell involved to figure out what boy it  wants to do.  Sometimes, uh, no, uh, so the, the first thing I did was click on my program called Snagget,  and, uh, I framed.  You have the gayest computer ever.  It's called Snagget.  Snagget.  And I.  You're the bad boy of computing. 
[01:11:00]  I'm the bad boy of computing.  You should be called Faggot.  Faggot.  Snagget.  Snagget.  I framed.  What does a Snagget do?  Well, I clicked on it, uh, started up, and I framed the, uh, I clicked and dragged to  pull a little frame around the window that showed the man ass in full video, and it captures  video.  So now I'm getting live video of what's going on, so I have it, uh, for evidence.  Oh, not just photos. 
[01:11:30]  Not photos, dude.  This is video.  Ooh.  He has it for evidence, Jimmy.  Oh, now I have it.  On his home computer.  Yeah.  Yes.  I watch it all the time.  I'm the bad boy of man ass video.  So, uh, yeah, the camera, uh, well, the camera stays in the same place, but, uh, the person,  the perp, starts moving away from the camera a little, and I notice it is our own Danny.  It is Danny's ass on the camera, and there he is laughing like an idiot, uh, with his pants 
[01:12:00]  pulled down.  Like an idiot.  Like an idiot.  Yeah, no, laughing.  He's a laughing idiot as an idiot.  Uh, so I thought he was just having a little fun, and that was, uh, pretty much it.  Moon the camera, have a few laughs, and leave.  Uh, this went on for hours.  Hours.  And not just Danny.  Uh, Danny types in. 
[01:12:30]  Now, like I said, I could see what he's typing.  For most people, in any kind of chat setup, you only see what the person has typed.  Yeah.  Since I'm looking in as if it's my computer, I can see what he's typing in before he hits  enter.  He's trying to type like, I'm so drunk, and it's like, I, N, greater sign, K, U, N, C, and apostrophe.  Like, back, back, back, erase, erase, it's taking him forever to type anything. 
[01:13:00]  And I type, you're drunk off your ass.  He goes, oh yeah, out with Ben, uh, last night, and we were doing a little drinking.  And then, out of nowhere, you want to see Derek's bag?  And, dude, this is far from closed circuit.  This is the open Opie and Anthony live room.  So, there's people in it.  There's fucking hundreds of people in the room. 
[01:13:30]  Because, like we have been saying lately, this experience, the Opie and Anthony experience,  just continues after we end the radio show.  So, there's Derek now, with his eyes are slits, because he's like smiling, he's all drunk,  and walks up to the camera, pulls his zipper open, and pulls his dick and bag out,  holding his cock so you can't really see it, and tea bags in front of the, uh, in front of the camera.  So, all you're seeing is his yam bag in front of the camera, and they're all laughing their asses off. 
[01:14:00]  That is the weirdest shit.  And then, more, so, so now, uh, the battle starts.  Because I can control the, the mouse from home.  They can control it from here in the studio.  So, it's a big tug of war trying to get, because I'm trying to bounce them from the room.  They're trying to stop me from bouncing and shut down the program that lets me see it from home.  So, I pull down the thing, and now I'm trying to click on the, uh, the control that, uh, removes any control they'll have of the keyboard. 
[01:14:30]  Every time I click on it, they unclick it.  So, it's this back and forth thing going on.  Uh, this war going on.  And, uh, I finally lose it.  I lose the battle.  I lose the picture.  I lose everything.  Uh, meanwhile, they lose the feed to the internet.  So, they're, they have no camera right now.  Uh, about 15 minutes goes by.  I'm able to log back on.  So, I log back on to the office cam to see what's going on. 
[01:15:00]  The camera slowly fades in.  They couldn't possibly have known that the camera was on or off or coming on or anything.  As it fades in, there's two asses in front of it, spread cheeks, assholes a-blazing, like they stood there for 15 fucking minutes waiting for that camera to come back on.  What the hell is going on?  Oh, I didn't get into guest number three that was in the studio also. 
[01:15:30]  Yeah.  Which is probably, yes, it gets sicker than this.  Than two men, uh, showing bag, dick, and ass to hundreds of people.  I'm watching the pad data, uh, pad data as you talk about this.  First it said Danny is gay, and now it says Derek is gayer.  And I was holding out hope for, uh, for good old Derek.  I thought he was, like, the normal one of the bunch.  I thought he was the responsible one.  I thought he was the behind-the-scenes guy, just wants to do his job and go home, but. 
[01:16:00]  Nope.  Man, he's got the spotlight today.  Last night, you add a little booze to these guys.  Do you remember any of this?  A little booze.  That was a little bit.  A little booze?  What were you guys drinking?  I don't even know.  You don't even know?  You, like, must have blacked out.  Yeah.  Because you were doing and saying shit that just was so fucking inappropriate.  That was, that was dangerous drunk.  Yeah.  Really dangerous drunk.  Yeah.  So, uh, I'm looking, and all of a sudden, I look at the camera, I look at the feed, and  there's a woman in our office. 
[01:16:30]  And I'm like, what is going on here?  Probably not the first time there was a woman in our office.  Probably not.  In our office.  But it didn't, she didn't look like the kind of woman that these two would be bringing  back for some action or anything.  She was a little older.  Uh, didn't seem like the type.  It seemed like the type, if, you know, you were your guy's age, and you went and got a  little drunk, you'd pick her up.  You know.  I'm trying my best not to insult the woman.  Oh, go right ahead.  Because she was Danny's mother. 
[01:17:00]  Danny, I guess, went out drinking with his mom, came back to the office, showed his ass,  his yam bag, along with Derek, and brought his mom along.  Uh, then the signs started getting held up in front of the camera.  Uh, because people were asking, who, who's the woman in there?  And, uh, he said, my mom.  Uh, my mom, she's looking for action.  Um, she likes the big black cock, is the sign that Danny then held up about his mother, 
[01:17:30]  who was on camera.  He also held up a sign that said, I want to fuck my mother.  You did not.  Dude, dude.  What is wrong with you?  He did.  Then, he said, she's looking for action and big black cock, and gave out her work email  address to the hundreds of people that were on Pal Talk at the time, watching this fucking  atrocity go down in our office. 
[01:18:00]  Is she hot?  Huh?  Is she hot?  Well, uh, she's a, she's not my type.  She's, uh, not, you know.  I like, uh, I like him a little younger, you know, than, than his mom.  Um, his little brother's cute, though.  That disturbed me, too.  How did my family get involved with this?  It's the fact that his little brother-  How did your family get involved with this?  Is watching this shit.  Are you kidding?  Yeah, because he's on, he's in the room, he's watching his older brother hold up signs 
[01:18:30]  that say he wants to fuck his mother.  It was, uh, uh, dude, hours.  How, it was an hour from the time Danny posted, well, I'm outta here, till the time I think  he actually left.  And that was already over an hour into the whole thing.  And I think Derek might have passed out somewhere near the facility, in the facility.  I have no idea.  I couldn't find him.  By the time I, I, I punched the camera back up, it was all askew, pointing at something 
[01:19:00]  that meant nothing.  I did see, uh, Travis walk in.  And, well, all this debauchery is going on.  All this very gay shit is going down.  And then, uh, these two leave the camera for a few seconds.  And Travis walks in and sits down at the computer to get some work done.  Like, it, it was just, it's surreal.  I don't know what the fuck goes on in this place.  And all you could see was, I know Than was somehow involved in this situation, but he 
[01:19:30]  was playing it safe.  All you could ever see was the top of his hat, because he would never be in camera.  He was skulking around, like doing a low crawl, uh, past the camera so no one could really see.  Well, he's holding on hope to be a politician still.  Yeah, you don't want these.  Just in case.  Dude, I have career ending video, uh, if you ever want to pursue a career in politics,  or, uh, anything.  Anything.  But I'll, I'll hand this over to you.  Well, the phones. 
[01:20:00]  I certainly don't want them.  The phones.  A lot of pal talkers checking in that saw this last night.  Matt from Yonkers, what's up?  Hey, you guys forgot the best sign.  My mom speaks Greek.  Oh, yeah.  You held up the...  Was your mom hammered?  Uh, probably.  I can't even tell you.  I mean, I was so...  Y'all seemed a little drunk.  I was so hammered.  By the way, I saw her fucking with the television set.  Oh, did she really?  Oh, yeah.  She was fucking with the plasma TV in the office.  Want to check out the Olympics or something? 
[01:20:30]  I don't know.  Joe from Brooklyn.  She was writing signs, handing them to Danny here.  There's the black cock.  Hold on, Joe.  Hold on, Joe.  Hold on.  Go ahead.  Morning, guys.  Am I the only one that finds this, like, extremely disturbing?  No.  No, you're not the only guy.  You should have seen it.  We got gaping assholes.  We got ball bags.  What went on?  What do we got?  A Guys Gone Wild video going on?  Hey, man.  What went on behind us?  Here's the deal.  Your heroes have flaws.  Many, many flaws.  That's the beauty of this show.  We just throw it all at you. 
[01:21:00]  All the scars and warts and...  It was a wreck.  Yeah.  So then for the rest of the night, any room I went into...  I also have another program where, instead of a camera feed from PalTalk,  I could pump in any video I want, and it shows up on the screen.  So I would go into the rooms and just replay the videos of these guys showing their ass  and ball bags in any room I went into.  That was really good when, later on in the night, I was in the 1,000-person-strong ONA war room, 
[01:21:30]  and your ass and ball bag was prominently displayed.  That was the rallying cry.  That was.  Battle cry.  It was like Braveheart.  Right.  And they all lifted their kilts.  Freddie Trek from Jamaica Station on the feedback.  Oh, yeah, you click and drag that man ass with your snag it, homo.  Yes, I snagged that ass.  Wow.  Well, here's a good question from Paul on Long Island.  Paul, what's up? 
[01:22:00]  Hey, any pubes on your keyboard?  No.  As a matter of fact, the second my bagel came here this morning to eat,  I went to reach for the mouse and realized they were touching their ball bag  and spreading their ass cheeks and then using the mouse to chat.  So I pretty much napalmed my desk, keyboard, and mouse with Lysol.  Very good.  And there it sits being disinfected.  All righty, guys.  Thank you.  Let's go to Iker's.  It looks like Iker's. 
[01:22:30]  Hey, guys.  Yeah, I was in the room at the same point Anthony was, apparently.  I didn't know it.  The first thing I saw when I opened up the office can was a ball sack.  And I'm like, what the hell is going on in the office?  And I waited, and it pans back, and it's Derek.  And I was just, like, in shock.  And then I'm also watching the chat, and it's exactly like Anthony described.  It was, you're so wasted, and then a bunch of gibberish.  And I'm like, who are they talking to?  I didn't realize it was.  Yeah, it's hard to explain because the people that were just viewing saw the name Ope Ant 1 where every other message was coherent because that was me replying to the first message from Ope Ant 1, which was Danny just babbling drunk. 
[01:23:00]  And me saying, you are fucking drunk.  So it was like a schizo.  Anyone from the outside looking in is like, why is this guy talking to himself, one drunk, one calling him a drunk?  That is.  I didn't figure it out.  So I clicked on.  I saw Dan's brother, and I opened that up. 
[01:23:30]  And there's a mini Danny without the facial hair.  And I'm thinking, what the heck is going on?  And the mom's in the room, too.  It was so bizarre.  Danny's whole family is involved in this program now.  Well, we got a lot of instant feedback here.  Don't forget Naked Dad.  Naked Dad, right, of course.  Axel from New York City, after he held up a sign saying, I want to fuck my mother, did he flush his XM radio down the phone?  Am I serious?  You had the order all wrong.  And then Nick from Columbus, Ohio, Danny to his mom, I wish I knew how to quit you. 
[01:24:00]  And Bert from Philly, Mom, I have to move the camera now.  I've got to do this.  I've got to do this.  Russ from Philly, what's up?  Hey, I want to get Danny's mom email address.  Yeah, can you give that out of your email address?  Everyone else got it.  No, I probably shouldn't.  Oh, yeah, no.  It's just going to be out there.  Let's see.  He started regretting things, because then I started getting emails to my email address going,  Accidentally shut down the program you used to talk between the two PCs. 
[01:24:30]  Sorry about that.  Well, I just wanted to make it abundantly clear that it wasn't me.  Yeah, it was Derek that did it.  Hey, let's say hi to Rob on Long Island.  Rob, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  How you doing, angry typing guy?  I'm all right.  Yeah, Danny's starting to sound a little bit like Bad Boy Bubby.  You know, we never finished watching that Bad Boy Bubby movie. 
[01:25:00]  I watched it at home.  I got that movie yesterday off of Netflix.  And you're right, I started watching it, and then once he's in the city and shit, it just  sort of tears out.  But, oh my God, that first half hour is so sick and brutal, what he does to that cat,  and then his mom and his father.  Yeah, it's a great, great first half hour of 45 minutes.  That's a good boy.  All right, thank you, buddy.  Well, this is a very good question from Chris in West Virginia.  Chris?  Hey, Danny, just curious if you got lucky last night with your mother. 
[01:25:30]  Well, it is West Virginia.  We need to know.  It was really, really disturbing, man.  One more, Jim in Ohio.  Jim?  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Hey.  Hey, it sounds like at nighttime they got the Brokeback Broadcasting Network going on.  No kidding.  And then, yeah, and then they, they, like, it isn't gay enough showing live man ass and  ball bag, but they think it's going to freak people out if they take a magazine picture  of a buff man and tape it up in front of the camera. 
[01:26:00]  After all that.  Once again, that was Derek as well.  After all that going down, live ball bag teabagging of the camera, like, a fucking model of a  guy, a picture of a model guy being taped in front of the camera is going to be shocking.  Derek's a little red.  Oh, yeah.  That's why this is a huge surprise.  This is why it's a huge surprise.  It's Derek we're talking about.  He was the guy we never thought would get into this crap.  Nah, you expect it out of some of the other guys. 
[01:26:30]  And then Danny's trying to make an excuse that he never went to college, so he's getting  it out of his system.  Yeah, that's what he said in the office.  He's, like, 32 years old or something, and he's finally living college life.  The binge drinking.  Yeah, he's going to mixers.  Right.  That's kind of what happens, though, when you don't go to college.  You know, alcoholism, incest.  Yeah.  It happens.  There's homoerotic moments with your co-workers in front of a camera.  I don't look at Derek, he goes, ugh, when you put it that way, ugh.  Well, I noticed that he showed a picture of Derek bending over, and fucking Derek is all 
[01:27:00]  bags.  It's amazing.  He can't hide.  We all did notice that, Derek.  What a bag you have.  Congratulations.  It's so weird.  You know, I get in here, and people start handing me stuff in the newspapers and, you  know, stuff for the show, you know?  Yeah.  And I'm like, all right, probably Olympic stuff, and probably this and that.  And they're handing over, you know, photos on paper of Derek's ball bag, and you've got  to check this thing out.  Yeah, check it out.  You can see it from every angle. 
[01:27:30]  It's like, I wanted to hit it.  Heavy bag.  The speed bag.  Yeah, working on the speed bag.  Yeah, right on.  Mark in Minnesota.  Hey, are you guys going to be, you know, making a video of all these luscious bags and man-ass  available online or anywhere?  I mean, come on, ONA hot webcam ass.  Yeah, what are you going to do, Ant?  You got the video.  What are you going to do with it?  Um, delete it.  Maybe Steve can put up a new site.  Oh.  Rate my bag. 
[01:28:00]  Yes.  ONA workers gone wild.  Well, that webcam is on 24 hours a day now, more or less.  Hot man-on-man action.  The office cam.  The action has drastically increased on the office cam.  You just never know when it's going to pop up and what the fuck is going to happen in  front of it.  Horrid.  Can we do office cam day?  Hmm.  What will that entail?  I thought that was yesterday.  It's a very easy concept.  Maybe Don could see if we can get away with this legally. 
[01:28:30]  Basically, we, uh, we, you know, put all the shutters down or shades or whatever, lock  the door, and then it's like an open call for people to come up here and do whatever  the hell they want on the office cam.  In front of the office cam?  Yeah.  Wow.  That's good.  It's like office cam day.  Uh-oh.  That is good.  Why?  Uh-oh.  I just see problems.  Why?  The listeners.  I see greatness.  I do, too.  The listeners.  Don, that's your homework assignment.  That's good.  It's almost like the- 
[01:29:00]  We want to do office cam day.  It's a talent show.  It's almost like a confessional for MTV.  You know how they did that with the real world?  They would have the confessional where you'd go in alone to a room in front of the camera  and either talk or do whatever you want.  That was your time.  Now, people are thinking about the obvious, you know, the sex angle, but it could be anything.  It could be anything.  You could confess shit.  You could just, uh, whatever.  Yeah.  Propose to your girl.  Yeah.  Ugh.  Anything.  Anything.  Anything goes. 
[01:29:30]  We want to do office cam day on the Open Anthony program.  Don, get that done.  Please.  That is a good one.  Like it?  How often do you have to shift so you're not sitting on your bag?  You can't get over the bag on this, kid.  Yeah.  Your bag has Down syndrome.  I was going to ask, is it healthy or not?  It looks normal, but it was just hanging like a big, just a big red ornament.  It was normal.  No lumps, no bumps.  Uh, are you really 82 years old or how old are you?  22.  Jesus. 
[01:30:00]  Jesus.  What?  He was holding his dick.  He was just holding his cock and his bag was just hanging from his hand, from the bottom  of his hand in front of the camera.  And Danny likes to say he wasn't doing that, but he was-  I didn't do it.  He had his ball bag out, Danny, and he's squeezing it.  Like, he's squeezing it so it's just popping out all veiny and shoving it into the camera.  And then at one point, you just dangled your dick right in front of the camera, Danny. 
[01:30:30]  Did I really?  Yeah, you did.  Oh, boy.  You were zipping back up and your dick just flopped in front of the camera.  Oops.  Was mom impressed?  I don't know.  Oh, God.  Derek, you have your pants pulled down midway down your thighs and your bag is hitting your  back belt loop.  Look at this picture.  It is hitting the back belt loop of his pants and they're pulled halfway down.  Old taffy bag.  I can actually, on a black and white photo from a cam 10 feet away, see the definition 
[01:31:00]  from ball to ball.  Yeah.  This fucking kid is really a-  It might be cold in here in the mornings, but I guess at night.  Very warm.  Old Reagan neck.  A nice Reagan neck bag.  A turkey bag.  Click clacks.  I could not believe that that was your mom in here, too.  With all that going on, I kept saying, no way that's his mom because he would not be saying  shit like this, but he had no problem with it. 
[01:31:30]  All right.  By the way, how fast on whack bag there's a name?  Derek's bag.  Oh, of course.  Derek's bag.  Let's go to Ryan in Pennsylvania.  Ryan?  Yeah, I want to know how many mousetraps Derek could fit on his ball bag.  I think it's so huge.  We're going to have to get, I don't know, dozens.  All right.  Thanks, Ryan.  Yep.  Bye.  So, there you have it.  That's what was happening last night.  Yeah.  A lot of fun going on when we're not here, Opie.  Yeah.  What was Ben doing all this? 
[01:32:00]  Wisely, he went home.  Yeah, Ben actually went, they were drinking, they outdrank Ben last night.  Ben decided, I had enough.  Yeah.  And he went home, and these guys continued drinking.  Well, that wasn't just a beer buzz either.  Apparently, we did a lot of shots, but.  Yeah.  Just really don't remember.  How do you get up?  How are you up this early?  I have no fucking idea.  I have no idea.  I don't know how he does it.  I gotta be.  I'm just numb right now.  Colby and Anthony.  Dude, what's up with the ski mask?  That's nice.  It's what?  It's cold out, huh? 
[01:32:30]  What's going on?  No, I just got Jimmy his bagel, and I had a way of this, because it's freaking cold out  there.  Where'd you go?  I went to the deli right across from Carnegie, right next to it.  Oh, wow.  That's kind of far.  Wow.  Okay, that's cool.  But there's good bagels there, though, huh?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  As long as it's not.  How many blocks is that?  Like one and a half.  It's not that big.  Really?  That's a little further than that.  It's cold out there, and they're long blocks, I think, right?  No, I just kind of got lost.  I'm not familiar with the city yet, that's why.  Oh, really?  Works on a grid system. 
[01:33:00]  On my way there, on my way back, I ran over here, because I knew where it was.  That's very nice of you.  What's the matter, Jimmy?  What hot?  Oh, you don't like the...  Oh, no.  I'm not even being...  You don't like hot bagels?  You can't.  You want to...  I should have told you that.  I didn't tell you.  Let me see.  Let me see.  Is it really hot?  Oh, yeah.  Everyone knows Jimmy doesn't like hot bagels.  They toasted it for him, huh?  Oh, no.  Oh, boy. 
[01:33:30]  That could be a problem.  It's hot.  I know.  That is really hot.  Did you listen to the show at all?  No?  I didn't.  Because Jimmy hates hot bagels.  That's my fault.  I should have said something.  I'm used to certain guys going.  I should have said something instead of...  I'm not telling you a jerk.  They all know.  Perhaps somebody should have said something.  Would you mind?  I'll get there next time.  Sorry about that, Jim.  Ah.  Well...  What am I supposed to eat? 
[01:34:00]  The next time might be now, because he needs to eat...  I'm not eating this.  What is this?  Well, how about you just eat that instead?  The multigrain?  Yeah.  That looks delicious.  Oh, boy.  Would you mind if you just went downstairs, because it's cold outside, and just got you  a bagel, maybe, from downstairs?  I'm not eating at that deli downstairs.  They wouldn't open...  I went for coffee one time, and they wouldn't open the thing.  It was like five to six.  And they're like, we're closed.  We're closed.  I'm like, but I work upstairs.  So I absolutely will not.  I want coffee, too.  Do you want coffee? 
[01:34:30]  Well, he's got to take care of the bagel, I think.  Yeah, you're right.  Would you mind going out and getting him a bagel?  What happens when the bagel just gets cool?  Nah, toast is disgusting.  Bread is not meant to be toasted.  It's just gross.  Bread is never meant to be toasted.  And that's my fault.  I should have said something.  I will take responsibility for that.  Well, all right.  Why don't you give him some more money?  Ugh, how does anybody eat that toasted?  Yeah.  I enjoy it, but I'm weird.  Yeah, I would eat it.  I'd have no problem eating that, but Jimmy's very...  Good for you. 
[01:35:00]  How much was it, man?  It was like 80 cents.  With cream cheese?  Yeah, on the side.  Oh, okay, here.  Give him a 20-cent tip and let him keep the change on that dollar.  I should have said something.  Next time you'll know.  I didn't say anything.  No, bro.  You want to write it down?  No, I got it.  All right.  I'm sorry to send you back out there.  It's kind of your ass.  Yeah, I'm sorry, bro.  I should have told you.  I didn't, and it's my fault.  Put the mask back on.  What, are you giving him a few more bucks for the cream cheese?  Eric?  Didn't mind.  All right.  All right.  Sorry.  All right.  I'm not being a jerk, dude. 
[01:35:30]  I apologize.  There goes the intern.  He's now going to get Jimmy's bagel, and hopefully it's not toasted this time around.  All right.  Sorry, bro.  You live and learn.  Yeah.  There he goes.  All right.  There he goes.  He's heading back out the door again.  It's 10 degrees out there in New York.  Oh, my God.  And I am now feeling bad.  He's gone?  I feel bad.  Me too, especially since I love a toasted bagel. 
[01:36:00]  You are a scumbag.  How do you do that?  I never saw that.  It's delicious.  I never saw that coming.  How do you look at it?  Because I know it's just-  I'm like, he goes, Jimmy pulls it out of the bag and goes, it's hot.  It's hot.  And I'm like, no, the thing is, it's cold.  It got cold from walking.  No, Jimmy puts a whole other spin.  He doesn't like hot bagel.  When he's leaving, his head's tilted down.  He's like, I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I didn't know.  I said, just do double time.  We want to go get it now.  Oh, my God.  When he comes back without the coffee, I'm going to go, wait, didn't you hear Jimmy say 
[01:36:30]  he wanted coffee too?  And then we're going to send him to Starbucks.  Oh, no.  And then I'm going to go, I'm going to just go, you know, maybe you're just not cut out for  this.  Oh, you are horrible.  If you can't get the food orders right.  All right.  So we got him to go for another bagel and when he comes back, he'll go for the coffee.  And then at that point, we need something else.  So start thinking.  I can't be part of this.  I can't do things like this.  I got to be good cop.  That's the only way I can do it because I know it's a bit.  Otherwise, I would feel bad for the guy.  Yeah.  I know it's a bit.  All right.  You go into good cop mode.  See, we're tearing down the third wall here. 
[01:37:00]  I'll go to bad cop.  No problem.  That's an easy role for me to play.  This is delicious.  Make sure he doesn't see you eating the bagel.  Oh, my God.  Jimmy's eating the toasted bagel.  I want him to walk in and see me eating it.  And just say you couldn't wait.  You took too long.  I'm not going to say anything.  I'm just going to tell him what I want for coffee.  I have to explain myself to him and his thin mustache.  He's going to walk in with the bagel and see you eating the bagel you can't see.  Yeah.  If he comes over and gets mouthy, I'll just get his mustache off by going like this. 
[01:37:30]  Dusty.  I'm going to hunk his shit under his nose.  It annoys me.  Damn.  Oh, that's awful.  He's going to see you eating it and be fearful and not say a word, but wonder why he had to  go out in the cold and get another bagel.  Let him wonder while he's got me an iced latte.  How many times has he been out?  This is his fourth, easily.  Yeah, it's got to be.  All right.  He's going to be like, sir, could you please make sure you don't toast that?  Please.  Don't even put it near the toaster. 
[01:38:00]  Hey, this is Bret Michaels of Poison, and you're listening to my good friends right here,  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Why don't you lead into the next one there, Steve?  But make sure you intro the show properly.  Yeah, go ahead.  It's the worst of the interns on the...  Shut up for two minutes!  Sorry.  You like that, don't you?  I was doing my Steve impression.  It was good. 
[01:38:30]  Thank you.  Welcome back to the worst of the interns on the Opie and Anthony show.  Screwed up worst.  Did I really?  Yeah, that time didn't sound that good.  Welcome back to the worst of the interns on the Opie and Anthony show.  In?  In?  Are you running through it?  Sure.  Yeah, you did say.  Welcome back.  It's the worst of the...  Are you going to shut up now?  Sorry.  I'm going to tell you to shut up.  Two minutes.  Welcome back.  It's the worst of the interns on the Opie and Anthony show.  Nice.  Thank you.  Smooth.  This next bit, we're going to talk a little bit about Sam.  Sam is a disrespectful little homosexual with curly *** hair. 
[01:39:00]  Steve, you can't say that.  Sure you can.  All right, HR.  What am I?  Dear human resources.  I think now I have an email to write.  Yeah, exactly.  This nigga...  What were you about to say?  What were you about to say?  Never call me that.  Don't you ever let me hear that letter coming out of your mouth.  I think you're saying negligent.  Yeah.  Sam...  I certainly hope so.  Sam at one point was an intern.  He was about to be hired.  And then we found someone who was equally as talented, if not more so, by the name of 
[01:39:30]  Roy Bradley.  Enough with the office.  I was banished.  These are all office jokes going away inside.  I know.  Jeez.  I'm listening.  Don't...  Just...  Come on.  Just read it verbatim.  You're a production master.  Just go right off the copy.  I mean, Eric wrote it, but still...  In this bit, Sam is sent to Starbucks to find out what a fritter is compared to Anthony's  normal apple cake.  The discussion of cakey versus flaky is brought up, and Sam is asked to put the counterperson  on the phone, to which the show screams profanities and slurs, leaving Sam to still try to purchase  Anthony's cake.  It was quite an undertaking. 
[01:40:00]  And you still screwed it up, didn't you?  An undertaker.  And did not screw up an order.  I remember that.  You screwed it up.  You brought back chocolate chip cookies, didn't you?  You just remember things that don't ever exist or happen.  Anthony asked for a piece of cake, and you brought back a bin of cookies.  Well, you were playing with your feet in your Spider-Man wallpaper crib room here, so...  Is that his music?  Yes.  Pretty sweet.  Yeah.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  What the fuck is a fritter? 
[01:40:30]  What?  What's a fritter?  What are you talking about?  An apple fritter.  What's an apple fritter?  Oh, Anthony wants apple cake.  He didn't say fritter.  I don't even know what a fritter is.  I'm scared.  You raceless creep, Sam.  What are you talking about?  I got a list.  No apple cake.  Just blueberry cake or apple fritter.  Oh.  What is an apple fritter?  It's more flaky.  How big are they?  It's kind of turnover.  How about this?  You get a turnover.  Exactly.  It's kind of like a turnover. 
[01:41:00]  Dan just put, like, his arms apart.  Like, how big is a marlin?  Did you see the fritter?  There is your fritter.  That's a fritter?  You don't want that.  Go with the blueberry.  That's like an apple turnover.  It's good.  Yeah.  It's a little more flaky than cakey.  But I'm going with the apple fritter.  Shame.  No.  Shame.  Shame on you.  That's right, folks.  No.  It's fritter talk on 202.  You might actually gain a pound.  I don't think you should do that.  I hate blueberry. 
[01:41:30]  Guys, let's do a funny feature.  Cake or fritter?  Call up and tell us why.  What do you think Anthony should have?  A fritter or a blueberry cake?  You tell us, and he'll eat it.  Or see neither a cock in his butt.  Well, game over.  Sam?  Yeah?  Sam?  Yeah.  What's a fritter?  I don't know.  It's like a pastry.  It's a donut type of glazed pastry.  How big is it?  Oh, it's about the size of a donut and a half, but there's no hole in it. 
[01:42:00]  A donut and a half without a hole.  And is it like an apple turnover?  It's like a flaky with some strudel icing.  It's like a pancreas.  Yeah, it's kind of like a, I don't know if it's flaky.  It looks, it could be flaky.  It's a little.  All right, let's talk to the Starbucks employee.  I want to get the definition from the Starbucks employee.  Put the person on their thing.  Say that again, sorry.  Give the lady behind, is it a lady or a guy behind the counter? 
[01:42:30]  All right, hang on.  All right.  Oh, there's a line here.  You just walk up to the front and tell us for a radio show description.  You have to say that, right?  You got the answer to every question you said wrong.  Excuse me.  Somebody on the air wants to talk to you.  Hello?  Hi, sir.  Hello?  Do you see the guy that just gave you the phone?  Hello?  Hello?  Do you see the guy that just gave you the cell phone?  Sir?  Hello?  I'm just extremely low. 
[01:43:00]  Do you see the guy that just gave you the cell phone?  The guy that just handed you the cell phone.  Hello?  Can you hear me?  Yes.  You see the guy that just gave you the cell phone?  Yeah.  He told us that you've been uppity.  This is Sam now.  What are you talking about?  The guy that just gave you the cell phone said that you've been uppity.  It's Sam, Opie. 
[01:43:30]  I don't have any company.  It's Sam.  We're doing a thing.  Are we talking to Sam now?  Yeah.  Sam, did you give the cell phone to the guy?  Yeah, I just did.  And he couldn't hear us?  He said you were low.  I'm putting you on speakerphone now.  You want me to give you back to him?  Why?  Yeah.  Put it on speakerphone.  All right.  Hang on.  Let me grab the same guy.  Excuse me.  Okay.  Hey, this is on speaker now.  Can you hear us?  Attention, all colored folk. 
[01:44:00]  Attention, all colored folk.  Get out of Starbucks, you colored people.  It's a white store.  There's AIDS in the muffins.  AIDS in the muffins.  We don't serve your kind.  All uppities leave the store immediately.  There's AIDS in the muffins.  Who is this?  Who is this?  What's a fritter?  What is a fritter?  Our friend is going to buy a fritter, and we don't know what it is. 
[01:44:30]  He thinks it's an apple fritter.  He thinks it's a racial slur.  Oh, shit.  Uh-oh.  I hope the phone went dead because it was being smashed against Sam's teeth.  They hit me in the mouth with the phone.  I had to go to the hospital.  I think that hurt.  I'm Sam.  But I'm related to Thomas Jefferson.  You know, he had black people, as are you. 
[01:45:00]  Exactly.  He'll be hearing Christmas music next when he wakes up.  All right.  Let's play Richard Simmons entertainment tonight.  Does he know I want a fritter?  Shit.  Someone call him back.  Yeah.  Tell him, get a fritter from the knitter.  Anthony's a fritter lover.  Do you want your daughter marrying a fritter, sir?  All right.  Let's play some Richard Simmons crying on E.T.  What's...  Uh-oh.  Don't spit in it.  What happened?  The phone does not pick it up.  It just goes right to the whistle. 
[01:45:30]  I hope they smashed the stupid cell phone.  You know, Sam's probably trying to remove the phone from his colon.  It's a radio show.  They do that.  Ow.  Sam?  Yeah, I'm here.  How are you doing?  I'm all right.  He said it cut off when the phone went to the back.  Yeah.  Did you get my fritter?  No, but I will get it right now if that's what you would like.  Yes, I would, please.  Hey, is there a lady online?  Yeah, there's a couple of ladies online. 
[01:46:00]  Give the phone to a lady.  A lady.  Okay.  Excuse me.  Would you like to talk to a radio show real quick down the phone?  Uh, yes.  Hang on a sec.  Uh-huh.  Excuse me, miss.  Would you like to talk to a radio show really quick down the phone right here?  None of the ladies are talking to me.  Tell her we'll buy their coffee if they talk on the phone with us.  Yeah, we're taking a call about Starbucks.  They're trying to do calls about Starbucks. 
[01:46:30]  They'll buy your coffee if you talk on the phone.  Just for a second.  Hello.  Hello, miss.  What's your name?  Dan.  Hi, Anne.  Uh, you know, we actually just asked our guy to hand the phone to the ugliest woman online.  So, as a result of that, you win a free cup of coffee.  He picked you.  Thank you.  Are you fat?  No problem.  Thank you.  Are you fat?  How did he do?  Was he accurate?  He's leaving. 
[01:47:00]  Sam, get us on speaker.  I love that gag.  Oh, my God.  Is that the best.  Sam?  Yeah.  Are we on speaker?  Yes.  Uh, yeah.  But, I mean, I don't know.  We're going to hear you.  No one's going to hear it there.  No?  No?  That's too bad.  Damn it.  Yeah, you want an apple fritter.  All right.  Thank you, Sam. 
[01:47:30]  And after all that, don't spit in it.  All right.  I'm going to get an apple fritter with jizzam on it.  An apple spitter.  Opie and Anthony.  How about Luca?  You remember her?  We got to come back.  I know.  I just want to, beforehand, before we throw it to him, I want to see how he does.  Do you remember Luca?  Cindy.  Sidney.  Illiterate hump.  No, I don't remember her.  Eric, what do we got next?  Ah, it's the worst of the interns on the Opie and Anthony show.  So, this next segment is intern Luca. 
[01:48:00]  Her real name is Sydney.  She showed up to work one day.  She had a black eye.  And, um, Stan.  Why is everybody, look.  It's a professional radio studio.  Stan is eating, messing with his papers.  Eric is taking a phone call.  Steve doesn't even have pants on at this point.  And we're his employees.  It's a comfort thing.  Strictly a comfort thing.  Then why is your penis erect?  Because it's a comfort thing.  Strictly a comfort thing.  Anyway, Luca showed up with a black eye, which, uh, Anthony was, uh, obsessing over. 
[01:48:30]  But she wouldn't reveal how she got the black eye.  Way to not get it, Travis.  See, eye sounds like guy, so one of us could have said eye, but you said, I'm the eye.  We got it.  Get it?  If you say black eye real quick.  Scott Beowulf.  Yes.  That's a good joke.  So, uh.  Sorry, start over, Eric.  So, this chick got punched.  She wouldn't talk about why she got punched.  Uh, they made fun of her, and then shortly after, she disappeared, and they never heard  from her again.  Was there intense examination ensuing?  No, just a lot of, uh, pointing and laughing. 
[01:49:00]  This seems like one of those clips that we shouldn't play.  Yeah.  Let's not hit it.  Hit it.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Wow, our new intern has a black eye.  I can't take the intern with a black eye.  What is, what is?  Why do you have a black eye, man?  I got elbowed in the face.  People do the craziest things to get on our radio show.  This is amazing.  This is our new intern.  Hi.  What's your name?  Sydney.  Sydney.  Yes.  Okay, and she's walking around, and all of a sudden I'm looking going, holy, yes, she's  got a black eye. 
[01:49:30]  You know, there's, there's programs where you can go and, uh.  Yeah.  You know, get, get a room away from this abusive person.  What happened?  I got elbowed in the face.  Elbowed in the face.  Yeah, I'm short, so I'm at elbow.  How did that happen?  I was working.  I'm a waitress.  You're a waitress?  Like cocktail waitress or food or?  Yeah, it's like bar and restaurant.  Bar, restaurant thing, and then you turn around and somebody's elbow was there.  It was really crowded, and I was trying to get through and pop.  What did you do?  Did you go down?  No, I.  No? 
[01:50:00]  You kind of like, whoa.  It's not stars, but I guess.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  Damn.  The chick with a black eye is just like, so hot.  No, I mean, it's, it's, it's one of those things where it's like you instantly think that  a guy just punched you in the face, you know?  No.  But you're saying that's not what happened.  Thank you.  So what are you going to say the next one is?  A door?  Yeah, that's what they told me to say, actually.  A door?  Walked into a door.  And then if it's the lip, you can say it's something else.  Someday we'll have to have an intervention, and, uh.  All right.  Yeah, yeah.  Thanks.  Thank you. 
[01:50:30]  Sydney, our new intern with the black eye.  Anthony, a lot of people don't believe our new intern story.  Sydney.  Yeah, I know.  She's got a black eye.  I got an email here.  Sydney's boyfriend checking in.  Tell that bitch to bring home my can of Chunky Soup, or she'll get more of what she got  last night.  Here's our new name.  Don't let her lie to you guys.  Her name is Luca.  Luca.  I live on the second floor.

[01:55:00]  Luka and Anthony.  Ricky's back with Jimmy's Bagel.  Oh.  All right, let's bring Ricky back in here, our intern, our new intern.  Oh, hang on a little out of this one here.  How'd you do, Rick?  Ricky, how'd you do?  I'm doing all right.  Well, you got to get on mic.  You went back to that other deli?  Yes.  Oh, good.  I got the change and everything.  Not toasted bagel.  Not warm.  That's good.  Give Jimmy his 20 cents back, please. 
[01:55:30]  All right.  Put that in your pocket, Jimmy.  Cool.  All right.  And, uh.  What's the matter?  Nothing.  It's good.  What, you have a hot bagel?  What's wrong, Eric?  There's no cream cheese.  My bagel is, like, burnt.  Oh, boy.  How do you know it's burnt?  You didn't even open up the package.  You know how hot it is.  Nothing on it.  No cream cheese.  Did you want cream cheese on your bagel?  Yeah.  All right.  I might have been switched, sorry.  I'm not going to share this cream cheese. 
[01:56:00]  Yeah.  Don't worry.  It's just Eric.  He's just a little man on the totem pole.  You don't have to go back out.  These guys understand.  If, like, one of these guys would have gone out, they know exactly what everyone wants  at this point.  I think the training process is a little rough here, but, you know.  All right.  It's something everyone's gone through.  Jimmy?  I just want coffee.  I'm fine, man.  Yeah.  Bring the coffee in.  And you got the bagels good?  Yeah.  He didn't get the coffee when he was getting the bagel?  No, I think he did.  Jimmy said, you know, coffee for everybody. 
[01:56:30]  Where is it?  Huh?  Outside?  By the chess board?  I don't remember him mentioning coffee.  Oh, no.  We can play the tape back.  Didn't you say coffee, too, and you asked if I want one?  Can we play back that part of the show or no?  It would be too tough?  All right.  Dirk's going to find it.  Yeah, we asked for coffee.  I don't want any.  Yeah.  I don't drink coffee.  Jimmy, can you do without coffee, hopefully? 
[01:57:00]  No.  I've been up since yesterday.  I've been up since last night at 5 o'clock.  I slept all day yesterday, and I woke up at 5, and I'm trying to stay up today so I can  get my schedule back by going to bed tonight, which I have to do.  Well, the coffee's in...  What?  That's just across the street, right?  Starbucks, yeah.  Oh, Starbucks.  Oh, yeah, Starbucks.  Okay.  Where is it?  Huh?  Starbucks is right next door.  Well, he forgot, Jimmy.  It's all right.  He's new.  I want...  Let me jot this down.  Yeah, I have to get that down.  You're here.  Yeah, you better write it down.  Just give me a tall coffee. 
[01:57:30]  I'll give you a little extra here.  Keep the 30 cents for yourself, all right?  Tall coffee with milk, not cream, please.  All right.  It's no big deal.  It's just across the street.  I want a medium iced...  Huh?  No sugars?  No, I got the Splenda over here.  That'll be nice.  Medium iced latte with skim milk, please, buddy.  Thank you.  This is four.  Just whatever's left over from his, just use it to finish up that one.  Well, you want the change back, though, I think.  No, no.  I'm saying it's going to be more than four. 
[01:58:00]  It's like 4.30.  Oh, all right.  Yeah, make sure you don't use any of your money.  That's not cool.  Yeah, just use the extra 30.  All right.  Medium iced latte with fat-free.  Coffee?  No.  No.  All right.  Ricky, sorry.  Sorry.  I know we said it, though, on the air.  Sorry for it.  All right.  There goes Ricky, the new intern.  He's heading out for, I think, the fifth time now to get food and coffee and bagels and  stuff like that.  He's gone?  You are awful, Jim.  Why?  Right when I noticed he was almost smiling, like, oh, boy, are they sending me out again? 
[01:58:30]  Is this a gag?  Jimmy puts on this face that completely made him wipe his smile off his face.  You put on this face like, you know, no, I've been up all night.  Like, he's getting pissed off.  And the kid just, like, the smile went right away from his face.  Okay.  Pulls out his little pad.  I'll write it down.  Got to get it right.  That's funny.  All right.  Well, there you go.  So it's intern runaround today on the program. 
[01:59:00]  We do this from time to time.  All the other guys are relieved that it wasn't them.  They're all like, whew.  Hey, this is Rob Zombie, and you're listening to Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Well, this is the worst of.  Totally.  What vacation is this for?  Thanksgiving?  Yeah, Thanksgiving.  This is Black Friday.  Oh, dude.  You can't call it that.  Earl Friday.  All right.  Can I get this out?  Sorry, dude.  Some of the worst of the interns that we've had on the Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:59:30]  Now, this next clip, I remember Intern John.  This was way back a long time ago.  You don't remember this.  Yeah, I do.  You're thinking of Intern John, who didn't remember anything.  He was dubbed the Memento Guy.  Oh, I like how you...  Yeah.  He does a coffee run and screws up Anthony's order by shortchanging him, which Anthony hates  that.  I know from personal experience...  Yeah, it's not about you.  Steve, you actually worked on the show during this Intern's...  Oh, I was there.  Do you remember the Memento Guy?  Steve?  John the Memento Guy. 
[02:00:00]  Speaking of which, Saeed's doing a great job bringing me my lunch today.  Ooh, good job, Saeed.  John.  I remember John the Intern.  Let's go back to Sam.  Well, the whole thing with the shortchanging him led to a rant about all the times that  John screwed up coffee and food runs, which was...  I mean, I remember that.  Very tense in the studio.  Fanboy.  Let's go to tape.  You're reading it off the paper.  What paper?  Thanks, Steve.  I don't remember that.  That's your outfit.  It's the worst. 
[02:00:30]  It won't be in Anthony.  Wow.  Thank you.  Thank you so much.  John, could you please put this in the refrigerator outside the studio?  That's the cold one.  Why are you talking so slow to John?  There you go.  John, wait, wait.  He's taking ten steps.  John, could you put that in the refrigerator over by the phone's pass?  Make a right at the foosball table and put that in the fridge. 
[02:01:00]  We call him Memento Guy.  John, do you have a cell phone on you?  I'll call you when you're halfway there and remind you what you were doing.  Can you tattoo instructions to your body?  Tattoo it, Memento Guy.  John is Memento Guy.  Short-term.  There he goes.  Short-term memory loss guy.  There he goes.  Memento Guy.  He screwed me up so bad today, and it was directly based on what a prick Opie is. 
[02:01:30]  It's twofold.  It's how much he forgets.  And can you just tell people that I'm...  And what a prick you are.  Can you just tell people it's just a character I play, though?  Yeah.  It's a character 24 hours a day.  Come on.  It's not that bad.  All I know is...  I play prick guy.  That's it.  While we are...  While we are prepping for the show.  We were prepping today.  In the office.  Yeah.  We were prepping today.  Right.  And John isn't even an intern.  We watch South Park.  But for some reason, the ritual of the show's coffee... 
[02:02:00]  It has become a ritual.  Well, Ben, I don't know.  You need a goddamn thermometer to know what Ben wants that day.  He's actually said this.  If the temperature is over 72 degrees, I need iced coffee.  Yeah.  If it's below 72, I need hot coffee.  We have lost our minds.  You could totally tell that we need to leave for a week or so.  Me and Ben want Brooklyn Diner coffee. 
[02:02:30]  Opie and Norton hate Brooklyn Diner coffee.  They want a coffee from a shop that I believe exists only on Mount Olympus.  No.  And comes out when the sun hits a reflector.  Because no one can ever find it.  It's called Phillips.  And it's a block away.  Phillips a block away.  And I'll go with the Europa coffee if they can't figure out how to get the fill-up.  Europa sucks.  Me and Ben hate Europa.  I won't do the cafe lattes from Europa anymore, though.  It sucks.  So today... 
[02:03:00]  But John and many people that were before John...  Yeah.  ...they can't figure out how to get coffee.  It's amazing.  One guy...  Like you said, we like Starbucks.  Phillips is a pretty fancy coffee shop in our area.  Brooklyn Diner downstairs.  Nice coffee.  Yeah.  You send them to like a Phillips or something, which I don't think is that hard to find.  They will come back with coffee cups with Greek writing on it and claim that they went to Phillips.  From the Greek diner or something. 
[02:03:30]  It's diner coffee because it has the Greek writing right on the side.  It has become...  And then they go, no, man.  I was at Phillips.  And we're like, you're a lion.  They have the fancy Phillips cups.  It has become this retarded ritual now to get coffee.  Now, this is what happened today.  And this is the price that your pal Anthony pays for Opie being such a prick.  No.  It came down to me getting screwed because Opie was a prick today.  Opie likes his coffee.  Likes it the right way. 
[02:04:00]  I'm on a cafe latte.  Right.  Cafe latte.  Half milk, half skim milk.  That's what it's got to be.  How hard is that?  Which is fine.  Cafe latte, half whole milk, half whole fat.  This isn't the prick part.  The prick part is that God forbid something isn't right or it comes from a different coffee place.  And I understand this.  If it's something you don't want because it's just something you want.  When you want something and you don't get it, it kind of gets you annoyed a little bit.  How many times have they screwed up our coffee order, though? 
[02:04:30]  A thousand.  All I'm saying is I am easygoing guy.  And I get F because of it.  You know something?  If coffee comes and it's wrong, I'm just like, I'll put more sugar in it.  I don't care.  I never get upset with the people because it's like, who cares?  It's just goddamn coffee.  One day last week, it cost me close to 20 bucks to get a cafe latte.  Yeah.  And Mary walking, I believe, 36 miles of roads. 
[02:05:00]  Because she couldn't figure out where Phillips was.  I know.  And I told her right behind Carnegie Hall.  It's right there.  It's a block away.  Indiana Jones has to go to the map room with the pole and the crystal on it.  And when the sun shines, it shows you where Phillips is.  I know it doesn't exist.  It exists.  No, it doesn't.  Stop it.  So can I defend myself?  Because today, I was in a bad mood because of Mr. Fuji screwing up my sushi order.  Fuji screwed up his order.  Gave him fatty tuna.  It tastes like margarine on rice. 
[02:05:30]  I hate the...  That's my line.  I know.  I was quoting you.  Okay.  Well, make sure.  I was quoting you.  Don't rip me off.  Hoo-hoo.  No.  Well, the fatty tuna, these stupid sushi places think it's a delicacy.  They're doing you a favor by giving it to you.  It's a piece of margarine on rice.  It has the same texture when you put it in your mouth.  It's disgusting.  So I had to call Mr. Fuji and give him some of my business, man.  I asked for tuna sushi.  They gave me the fatty toro, whatever they call it, crap. 
[02:06:00]  So then I beat up our Xbox and the Xbox games.  I was so pissed.  He rips the drawer out of his desk and starts throwing his drawer.  Oh, man.  I didn't want the fatty tuna today.  And I'm like, all right, well...  You send it back!  We didn't have time.  It was too late in our show prepping, remember?  Yeah.  Here's where I get screwed today.  So then I just...  All right.  Here's where I get screwed.  Opie brings up that he's going to get a mocha...  What were you getting?  A latte.  A latte.  A latte at Starbucks.  So I'm like, you know something? 
[02:06:30]  John's going to Starbucks.  I'm not going to have him go to Brooklyn Diner also.  Although he had to because it was over a certain temperature and Ben needed his ice  cloth.  That's true, too.  Can we make sure that the listeners realize that John is dumber than a box of rocks, right?  Oh, God.  For this bit.  Because that's the truth.  It's not that.  His whole mind is so full of video games and video game knowledge, everything else has  fallen out.  Like, you're graduating college and you're having an argument with Mary how to spell Los  Angeles?  Holy S.  It turned out you spelled it right.  Yes.  Congrats.  Okay. 
[02:07:00]  This is how we spell it.  So...  Go ahead, Anthony.  So here's what happened.  I give John $5 because I know he's going to Starbucks.  I know it's very hard for everyone to pony up the cash for some reason.  So I give John the $5 knowing that I'm going to get my coffee and I don't care who else.  I don't want change or anything.  It doesn't matter.  Opie gives him this gauntlet.  He lays down a gauntlet for John.  You go down there.  I am timing.  Just like Grand Theft Auto 3. 
[02:07:30]  This is a timed mission.  I'm telling you.  Now he's just...  Because now I'm living in a video game right now.  It's not good.  Put it this way, too.  Opie is completely effing with him.  He's tooling with him.  It's fun.  So John gets so serious about this and Opie tells him, look, if the order is bad, I hope  you know I'm going to throw it at you.  Just to see the look on John's face because it's kind of funny to watch.  But then when he laughs, I made sure you guys realize that now I committed myself and  if he comes back with the wrong order, I have to do it because I'm all talk, no action 
[02:08:00]  lately.  You wanted a large cafe latte.  I wanted...  I asked John for a large caramel mochiata.  And I'm like, oh, what are you insane?  He's going to go to a sushi restaurant with an order like that.  He doesn't know what a mochiata is.  Ah, mochiata.  He wrote it down phonetically so he can just say it to the guy.  I thought he was going to come back with some shrimp dish with brown sauce.  What the hell is a mochiata?  You know what happened?  And I had not put the fear in him that Opie did. 
[02:08:30]  I had not frightened him enough that he got mine right.  Well, well, here's what happened.  One thing you're forgetting?  Yeah.  I didn't give any money.  No, no.  Because I thought you were...  And you know, before...  I mean, the old gag, I know.  Ha, ha, ha.  But in this case, though, hold on.  You gave three dollars and he asked for change.  Shut up, you douche.  At least we all could hate you.  Anthony.  Yeah.  We take turns buying coffee.  So I assume that you were just buying my coffee today. 
[02:09:00]  I had no clue.  Short arm.  He never asked me for money today.  I was...  But see, the thing is, Ben put in three.  Anthony put in five.  I found this out after the fact.  I was handed...  I think Ben handed me just eight bucks.  So I figured just everybody put in.  You know what I mean?  No, it's...  Well, you know, I don't know what he's talking about.  Can I go to Lee real fast?  Because he brings up a good point, but I have an answer to this.  Lee.  Yeah, what's up?  Go ahead, real fast.  Listen, instead of your half-skinned milk, half-whole milk, how about one or two percent? 
[02:09:30]  Exactly.  Oh, there you go.  But I'd do it the other way, just to F with him.  And trust me, he couldn't even figure it out.  And then he's getting paper.  I'm like...  And then he's like, okay, what was that again?  And I'm like, you're like the guy from Memento.  You don't remember anything.  So here's where me not putting the fear into John effed me.  I put in five bucks.  I wanted the large caramel mochi on.  And at this point, our show prep had to stop because now he's on a time mission, and he 
[02:10:00]  only had 15 minutes, so we're all just sitting there watching the clock.  Watching the clock.  We're grown men at this point, but we're freaking retarded still.  John gets back just about on time.  We gave it to him.  He was a little over, but...  He's very happy.  Rick effed with him on the way out to mess him up for that 30 seconds, so I gave him  the 30.  He's very happy about his going to get the coffee.  He feels he did a great thing.  He hands Opie his large.  He plunks it down on the big desk. 
[02:10:30]  Yeah.  And then everyone at this point, Rachel, everyone else is in the office.  About 10 eyes now are staring at me like I'm the kid from the Twilight Zone movie, Anthony.  Is it okay, Anthony?  Right.  I'll send you to the cornfield, so everyone...  Sure, that's your coffee, Anthony.  It's wonderful coffee, isn't it?  Sure it is.  So you could hear a pin drop in our office at this point as I'm inspecting the order.  Now remember...  And then there was a big, ah. 
[02:11:00]  Ah.  Because my order was right.  Opie cracks open the top of the coffee container and sees it is indeed a large cafe latte as  per instructions.  Now John turns to me.  I was tipped off right when he walked in.  I saw the coffee holder and what amounted to a paper shot glass in the coffee holder,  and I go, all right, is that mine?  He goes, yeah, and get this, guess what he says.  He goes, I had to get you the small because I didn't have enough money for everything. 
[02:11:30]  I put in five effing dollars.  You put in the most money.  Now the thing is, if Opie hadn't given money that day, you would think, all right, Anthony  gave me five.  I'll make sure he has the large.  Opie, sorry, you got to get the small because you were the one that didn't put the money  in that day.  But no, he never imagined not getting Opie the exact order because Opie would have thrown  it at him.  And me, I'm like, okay, I'm the good guy. 
[02:12:00]  Well, I'm going to start being a little more of a prick.  I started laughing.  I'm going to start busting some heads.  It needs to be, a couple things need to be said now, Anthony.  Yeah.  This was right before showtime.  So then everyone marches down the hall to the show.  Oh!  Oh!  Wow, you're, you're, I'm losing my effing mind, guy.  Was that filled?  Yeah.  I just threw my full coffee at John.  You're never going to get a small cup of coffee ever again, see? 
[02:12:30]  See, you've learned from the master.  I am proud of you today, my friend.  Well, I had to Opie.  So a couple things happened.  The whole, uh, the whole show marched down to the studio to, to, to set up for showtime.  Yeah.  I, I stayed back with John and the cup of coffee just threw.  I, I had John get you another mocha cheetah, whatever it's called.  Yes.  Mocha chino.  Mochiata.  Mochiata.  Whatever the hell they call it.  And we're walking down the hall and John goes, you know, you put me in a bad position. 
[02:13:00]  I had to make a decision.  I know.  He had to make like a command decision at that very moment.  Decide who gets the large cup and who gets the small cup.  Because it was directly, he did an assessment of who's going to cause him more damage.  And he realized, all right, you know, I got to get a go-op his order, even though it was Anthony's money.  Right.  Holy Christ.  Caramel mochiata, coffee latte, do your vaginas itch when you drink your coffee.  That's from Joey in D.C. 
[02:13:30]  He's so right, man.  You're right, man.  Aaron, what's up?  Hey, what's up, Bob?  Hey.  Let me ask you a question.  So how much money have you wasted on bad coffee so far?  We go through a lot of money on coffee alone.  It's really silly at this point.  So why don't you guys just get a coffee maker?  We have, let me tell you something.  Oh, my God.  We have the greatest coffee machine ever invented right outside the studio.  This is, you press a button and coffee comes out of here.  Espresso comes out.  Mocha Espresso.  Mocha Espresso comes out.  Hot chocolate. 
[02:14:00]  It is Pete Johnson's dream machine.  It's the Pete Johnson dream machine.  I am constantly making sure that that machine is mechanically sound to deliver coffee.  Yeah, this coffee machine is so complicated.  The head engineer of this radio station spends more time making sure all the parts and everything is in order there.  I'm the only one authorized to service it.  Instead of on the studio.  That thing is open every day and he's replacing parts.  He's always in there.  I swear to God.  He's got like a creeper like they use at the garage and rolls himself under. 
[02:14:30]  And he's got socket wrenches.  I don't know what he's doing, but he makes sure that thing works.  Just show us.  Why don't you guys get a little personal?  What's your office and have John make coffee in the office for you?  Just show us how retarded we are.  I'm telling you, everyone that has come and checked out the show live has had coffee from that machine.  It's an amazing machine, but we'd rather send John on the street because it's fun.  Because it's so entertaining because you just don't know what he's going to bring back.  Yeah, we have no clue what he's coming back with on any given day.  And this is not just coffee, John. 
[02:15:00]  It's not just coffee.  Ah, come on.  We love you.  It's fun.  It's so much fun.  Go try yourself off.  You just don't.  I was like, oh, I was throwing things.  That was hilarious.  Hey, Ricky's back with the coffee.  That was fast.  Oh, my God.  Coffee.  Cool.  Thanks, man. 
[02:15:30]  Is it cold out there, bud?  It's not bad, right?  It's up to 11 degrees now.  Let me see if...  Where'd you get the seltzer?  Oh, this is perfect.  Do you need the deli downstairs?  Right downstairs?  That's not that far, right?  I should have told you if you were going for coffee.  Could you grab a can of seltzer, please?  Sure.  Thanks, man.  Hey, Ricky.  What's up?  You're doing such a good job.  Here's 21 cents.  You tell Ty Webb I'm gunning for him.  There you go.  Nice.  Perfect coffee. 
[02:16:00]  There you go.  Yeah, I just need seltzer.  A little club soda or seltzer?  Wow.  Get club soda.  I don't know if they have clubs.  I prefer the club soda, to tell you the truth, as opposed to seltzer.  Seltzer stinks.  But, yeah.  See if you can find some club soda.  The seltzer's like, meh, meh, meh.  You know.  Ricky, thanks. 
[02:16:30]  Yeah, that audio is really...  Don't forget it's club soda, right?  Okay.  It's like from the old days.  It's just so completely...  Just so completely dated.  Yeah, yeah.  A few seconds just...  As they're walking.  My nose, right?  Yeah.  It's just really old stuff.  Yeah, yeah.  What is old?  What?  Where are we?  The audio, you can see what old...  Oh, my God.  Well, I'm making...  No, Ricky's outside.  He's a little confused, because he heard club soda and seltzer.  Yeah. 
[02:17:00]  No, club soda is the way to go.  Yeah, club soda.  Whatever one he brings, you've got to say you wanted the other one.  Of course I do.  Ah.  Still there?  Yeah, I think so.  Because Eric is a dummy.  Was it on out there, though?  No, it's on.  Oh, it's on.  Oh, okay.  Good.  So whatever he brings back is going to be the wrong thing.  It's going to be the wrong thing.  Okay.  Hi, I'm Dave.  I'm Perry.  Steven.  And we're Jane's Addiction.  This is Jane's Addiction.  You're listening to Opie and Anthony.  You're listening to Opie and Anthony.  Anthony and Opie.  And you're listening to Opie and Anthony. 
[02:17:30]  Welcome to the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  It's the intern edition.  Welcome back, as it were.  You're shuffling around.  Welcome back, or welcome for the first time.  You just blew my mind.  We had an intern named Tom, who I believe they did hire at that other joint for a little  while.  So I guess I don't know why we're trying to sell people on internships.  Oh, look, they could turn into jobs. 
[02:18:00]  You could fuck porn stars.  Yeah.  Let's really try it, because why would you just want to help the show?  I get it.  We see Jim Norton discovers that, well, that's just the punchline.  Aw, Eric.  I know.  Wait, wait, wait.  And then what happens?  Ghostbusters.  All right.  This is the...  Ghostbusters?  They were on TV.  No, that's the full house.  That's the old twins.  Now, Ghostbusters were just on TV, I swear.  This is when we meet intern Tom, and Jim makes fun of how short his arms are.  Go.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  Speaking of, I don't know what, but... 
[02:18:30]  There's Mr. Yankee again.  Yeah.  That's an awful big jersey.  Some people can wear Yankee jerseys, and you don't notice it.  You, like, don't even notice it.  It's just a jersey someone's wearing.  Yours, like, yells, Yankees!  Because it's so big.  There's so many pinstripes.  Do you have short arms?  Is that what it is?  Wait, you really do?  Where do people's arms come down to?  Hold on. 
[02:19:00]  Wait, you really do have short arms?  I couldn't tell...  All right, dude.  Your fingertips...  All right, hold on.  Let's all get up and...  Your middle...  Lock him.  This is something you...  Your middle finger...  Your middle finger is supposed to come down to, like, mid-thigh.  Okay.  All right, Jimmy's are a little short, too.  Yeah, Jimmy, you got short arms.  Just a little, though.  No, no, a different portion.  But yours are like at your hips.  I'm sorry I pointed that out.  I was going for the jump.  I'm sure he hasn't thought about it or been self-conscious about it for a while.  Yeah, no, he's never been self-conscious.  He doesn't wear extra large just to cover it up. 
[02:19:30]  Is it awful having to squat to get Tic Tacs out of your pocket?  It's not too bad.  Wait, but that's what I'm getting at.  Like, I thought it was the extra large jersey.  No.  No.  We're making your arms short.  So you have short arms, and now you're making it look even shorter.  Now he's rubbing them together all nervous.  In the front where they look normal.  Go chase Jeff Goldblum in a Jeep.  I got stubby thumbs, so it's okay.  Yeah.  We all have problems.  Yeah, way to make them feel part of.  I like to be able to all stood up and do the arms test.  We had to do the test and see where they come down to. 
[02:20:00]  I think Anne's arms are a little long, actually.  Yeah.  Your arms are longer.  My arms are pretty.  I was actually going.  If I stand up straight, then they come down.  Yeah, long fingers.  I was actually going for the joke, and I didn't expect you would actually say yes,  so I'm going to say.  Well, to me, it made it better.  See, I'm sorry.  I got this emotion in me, and I feel pain about myself now.  When did you first realize that your arms were a little kind of like, you know, freakish  and odd?  Your arm's too short to box with God.  His arms are too short to shadow box.  When did you notice? 
[02:20:30]  Probably in like middle school.  Middle school?  You were doing push-ups, and you chipped your teeth?  Does it present any problems?  Pitching?  Anything?  No.  No, you can't get that leverage?  You've got to have long arms, like, you know, something like the big unit.  Got them long arms.  You could really get a lot of leverage.  At least you were able to play soccer, you know.  Yeah.  No hands involved.  It doesn't mean math.  Is it frustrating when you're trying to clap, and only your fingertips would make this  noise?  He could still clap?  Of course he can. 
[02:21:00]  He just can't wipe his ass.  Is that a problem?  No.  It's not that all worked out, a stick or something.  What do you want to do when you take your hat off?  Just shake your head violently until it falls?  All these guys, all these interns, they can't wait for their airtime.  I bet you weren't expecting it to be this, right?  Don't put them in your pocket.  Don't hide them.  There's no reason to hide those shameful appendages.  Can you put them in your pocket?  Yeah.  He's not hiding them.  Look, they barely go. 
[02:21:30]  He's got to pull his feet.  He's going to squat down a little bit.  Squat.  In the pocket.  Stand up.  Out of the pocket.  Oh, wow.  That's something.  Any doctor ever said anything?  Pediatrician?  Never said, hey, he's got some short arms there.  No?  No, just the friends.  Friends?  They goof on it like Voss's little hands get goofed on.  But it's weird because it's like, you're not really sure if they're short or not.  No, but they are.  But then you look at them and they're like, yeah, they're short.  Yeah.  Well, he's putting them together again. 
[02:22:00]  Yeah, he's getting all nervous.  He doesn't want them to hang.  That's what he does when he talks to a pretty girl.  He'll probably stand there and kind of like just rub them together in front because it's,  you know, it's more of a safe gesture.  I understand.  Is that rough?  If you're kissing a girl in bed and you try to diddle her, does it just go like to her  belly button?  No?  You don't have a problem there?  Reaching down?  Is it awful like, have you ever just watched people hug and see their hands touch in the  back and go, oh, that must be nice and close.  That must feel good.  All right.  Leave him alone.  I'm feeling bad.  You ever make six three-pointers in a row? 
[02:22:30]  Not six, though.  Okay.  I'm feeling really bad.  All right.  No, I was just commenting.  I didn't bring up the arms.  I brought up the large Yankee jersey.  When I brought up the skull, you brought up the arms.  Yeah.  What's your name?  Maybe you shouldn't say it.  What?  Tom.  Tom.  All right, Tom.  So you're interning.  You go to college?  Yeah.  Cool.  Where do you go?  I own a college.  Which one?  New Rochelle.  Uh-huh.  All right.  You want to be a broadcaster?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's my goal.  You'd have to have someone push all the buttons if the board's too far from you. 
[02:23:00]  You got very mellow delivery.  I just get one of those little sticks.  There you go.  Is it awful to drive and have your nose touch the windshield?  All right.  Let Tom go.  All right.  I've been called T-Rex before.  Yeah, T-Rex.  My friends like to put their arms in their sleeves and hold them up.  Friends are real bastards, aren't they?  Yeah, they are.  But I get back in there for their flaws.  All right. 
[02:23:30]  I can't handle this today.  Will you leave?  All right, Tom.  See you soon.  Use your foot to open the door.  You're making me sad today.  Everything is sad today.  For me.  Lead paint chips.  Way to point out the one thing that he's been trying to hide with longer clothes.  Well, way to drag it out in four seconds.  Holy shit.  Hi, how are you?  Good.  Your arms are short.  All right.  Way to point it out in front of two nations.  The entire northern hemisphere.  You couldn't mention that in the office? 
[02:24:00]  I really thought because it was a giant jersey, it was making his arms short.  His arms look short, but his arms are indeed short.  I'm telling you, if he wore a regular shirt, I don't think they would look as short.  Oh, yes, they would.  No, they kind of hang down.  No, because he's got one of those oversized jerseys where it looks like a short sleeve,  but the short sleeve goes way down.  Yeah.  So it looks like his arms are shorter.  I'm telling you.  Let's do an experiment.  Get him a regular shirt.  How about go put a t-shirt on him now and just tell him to come in.  But tell him he can only prance in if he's wearing a top hat and spitting and throwing confetti to circus music. 
[02:24:30]  All right.  Tom's coming back in with a regular shirt.  Oh, goody.  Now I see there's lots of problems.  Well, let's see.  You now understand.  No, man.  I'm telling you.  Now they don't look short.  Yes, they do.  But maybe they see.  They're not as short.  You're kind of bent at the elbow.  They don't straighten out very well.  Yeah, there's something going on there.  Wait, what's the little tattoo you got?  There's a midget gene there somewhere.  Holy crap, dude.  You were this close to becoming a midget. 
[02:25:00]  You might have been close to being a midget.  How many times have you thought that?  You were like this close.  But someone was on your side upstairs and said, ah, let him go.  Pull him out of that midget thing.  I never really thought of it.  I got the short one.  Any leg issues?  Be honest.  I got a longer torso than I do legs.  No, no way you're short.  See, that's a midget thing.  He's short from his elbow to his shoulder.  From his elbow down, you're fine.  Oh, yeah, a little bit.  Let's see where the elbow is.  You see?  Wow, it's way up there. 
[02:25:30]  Okay, it's up there.  It doesn't bend out all the way.  It doesn't bend out.  So you're kind of like, oh, it's bent a little bit, which adds to the shortness.  Did you ever knock yourself out doing curls?  I came close, but never rolled away.  It's not bad at all.  I think when you're wearing the oversized jerseys, it makes it look worse.  What happened was, Tom is very lucky.  And I say this with love, because you're basically, here's what was happening.  God was creating a dwarf.  A dwarf, yeah. 
[02:26:00]  And he was throwing that last splash of DNA in, and the phone rang.  He went, hello?  Oh, push this one on.  Yeah, no, I'll be there tomorrow.  And you skated right there.  Yeah, you kind of went down the assembly line.  They missed you.  All of a sudden, he heard that Muhammad was talking bad about him on his radio show and  got distracted.  Got distracted, went off on a tangent.  Off on a tangent.  And you got to leave.  And the moment passed.  I just need you to do one thing.  Do you have a green wig?  I would like you to say, do-ba-dee-doo. 
[02:26:30]  You know what?  This is the radio.  People out there are going to think that we're looking at a real freak here.  No.  He's not bad.  He's fine.  But he was close.  You were close, though, dude.  He's fine.  His arms are in touch with you.  Because now people are picturing like you're 5'3 or something.  No, I'm 6'0".  He's 6'0".  Are you 6'0"?  You're taller than me?  Yes.  Wow.  Wait, go next to Jimmy.  Hold on a minute.  All right, Jimmy. 
[02:27:00]  Wow.  All right.  Well, look at how different the-  Your arms are.  Let me interrupt this program.  What?  Oh.  The Ozone Nidget Sighting of the Day.  Uh, Opie?  Yeah.  Hey, what's up, guys?  I just want to say I have a midget sighting today.  Okay.  Yeah.  About 12 feet away from me.  12 feet away.  What's he doing?  He's standing in front of me.  What's he doing?  He's wearing a Ron and Fez shirt and standing uncomfortably, rocking back and forth.  Rubbing his arms together.  With really short arms.  Right.  He's a little tall for a midget, but everything else kind of fits the criteria. 
[02:27:30]  Right.  Just wanted to get that out of the way.  Thank you, Anthony.  Meanwhile, back at the show-  I didn't know you were six feet.  I didn't realize that.  You're six feet tall?  So you said your legs are short.  How would you be a six-foot midget?  It's the most beautiful thing I've ever seen in my life.  Amazing.  A big problem with me with the clothes is I'm a bigger guy than most people.  Yeah.  I used to be a lot bigger.  Right.  Did you?  I lost about 70 pounds in the last few months. 
[02:28:00]  Oh, that made your arms look longer.  Hey, there you go.  No, it's not that.  It's just my clothes.  I guess my shoulders aren't as broad.  So the shoulders are meant to be out more.  So now, like, since I have an hour's shoulders, the sleeves dragged down, like, hang down a little bit lower.  Yeah.  Aw.  So what happens?  You have, like, a tattoo I see on your wrist.  On your left wrist, there's, like, a very light tattoo.  What is it?  It's an Irish clatter.  What is it like?  Is it, like, a tattoo of, like, weights?  No.  It's just, it's an Irish symbol.  It's an Irish symbol, the clatter. 
[02:28:30]  It's two hands holding together a heart with a crown on top.  The hands are a symbol for friendship.  The heart is a symbol for love and a crown for loyalty.  Okay, good.  That's wonderful.  It's a fucking...  Very known in the Irish...  He's a gang member.  He's a fucking taughtman.  A lot of people get it as a ring.  Yeah, a ring.  Clatter ring.  Well, that's a lot of young lovers exchange...  I held the cross on my arm.  Oh, you got one of those, too?  Yeah.  He's one of the Westies.  He's a fucking gang member.  Yeah, what are we doing?  I'm messing with this guy. 
[02:29:00]  Yeah, he's tattooed.  He's got the secret code.  I think your arms are just fine.  I don't need any problems.  Hey, fucking...  Hey, Tommy Tiny Arms is on his way to fucking see you.  All right.  And where are you from?  Yonkers, New York.  Yonkers.  All right, let's go to Ben in Savannah.  Ben.  Hey, yeah, what's going on?  Hey.  Hey, I mean, I know you guys got to be pretty distraught that you're not on the list.  It's got to be pretty hard for you to wrap your arms around it.  Oh, boy. 
[02:29:30]  You know, why would you want to make those kind of jokes?  Thank you, Ben.  All right, Tom.  Congratulations.  I bet you like the Navy, the Marines, the Air Force, but you hate the Army.  Just a constant reminder, right?  There you go.  All right.  All right.  Don't you wish you were in an arms race?  Sometimes.  New York, get the door for him.  Open the door for old crocodile limbs. 
[02:30:00]  If Tom gets mad at me, I'm going to run into a zigzag pattern.  You know, a little-known fact about him, he has ten times the energy to close his jaws  than he does to open them, so you can actually hold them shut with your thumb and forefinger.  But once he opens them, then there's a problem.  That guy fucks with me.  I'll make shoes out of him. 
[02:30:30]  All right.  Jesus.  I like Tom.  How can you not?  I think he's terrific.  He's a good boy.  He's terrific.  Toby and Anthony.  Hold on.  We've got to interrupt the show.  Oh!  Ricky's back.  Ricky.  We're in the middle of doing a bit here.  Ah.  Seltzer, my friend.  No club soda?  There wasn't club soda?  No.  Hold on.  What?  We've got to turn your mic on.  Oh, boy.  What?  No, there wasn't any club soda over there.  I was looking around the store for a while.  That's why it took me a little bit.  Yeah.  See, I'm on a low-sodium diet. 
[02:31:00]  Do you see 25 milligrams of sodium in that?  Club soda has no sodium.  That's the difference.  It's still bubbly water, but, you know, one or two is fine, but three?  Seltzer stinks, dude.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, I'll keep it here or something, but, you know.  Ah!  Get a buck.  Eesh.  Oh, my God.  This is, like, wasting the whole show today.  Yeah, you know.  Oh, sorry.  Sorry, dude.  I should have, I don't know. 
[02:31:30]  Maybe I told you.  Rick, do you think you're cut out for this gig?  You're killing me.  I'm trying my best.  I'm trying to do what I can.  There you go.  Yeah, club soda.  You keep that.  You keep that.  I don't even know where we were.  All right, let's start the whole bit over again.  Oh, boy.  You want to replay the audio or shoot?  I don't know.  All right, did you guys, did you interview him before we hired him to be an intern?  He seemed reliable.  Holy ass.  The audio's off out there, right? 
[02:32:00]  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  I feel bad.  I can't even do this.  Don't separate yourself from the group, Anthony.  I can't help it.  He's going to spit in your club soda like Kizzy.  I know, right?  You did say club soda, though.  He's gone?  Yeah.  Club soda, seltzer.  It's no difference.  I don't care.  It's not called seltzer water, can he?  And you're trying to say how you can't drink seltzer, and there's an empty one right next 
[02:32:30]  to you.  There's three of them next to me.  Yeah.  If I have to worry about 25 milligrams of sodium.  All right.  What do we need next?  We're running out of things.  We need things.  Dangs.  Dangs.  Jim's apple.  Did he get your apple today yet?  No, I didn't.  All right.  Very good.  Well, this he could probably really screw up.  All right.  I think he's going to come back with a nice crisp apple.  Don't even say it's crisp.  I won't say that word.  Okay.  Dude, and then throw it against the wall when he comes in. 
[02:33:00]  Please.  Dude.  Throw it against the wall.  Even if it's crisp.  And walk out.  Yeah, and walk out.  I dare you.  And walk out of the studio.  All right.  Please.  All right.  Here's another clip.  He's not going to come back with a crisp one, by the way.  Of course he's not.  Of course he's not.  He's going to have the consistency of something you find in a dumpster behind a Planned Parenthood.  This is great.  Should this have two little eyes in it?  Little Malfoy ears?  Hi, my name's Chris Cornell, and you're listening to Opie and Anthony. </pre>
