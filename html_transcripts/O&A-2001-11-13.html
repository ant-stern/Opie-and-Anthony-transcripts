<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a recounting of a harrowing car ride with their reckless Philadelphia driver, Sal, whose driving almost resulted in several accidents.  This was followed by a discussion of a business meeting with their program director, Tim Sabian, whose overly formal attire prompted much joking and mockery from the hosts.  Their Amtrak ride back to New York, filled with celebrity sightings (including Body by Jake and Congressman Jerry Nadler), provided further fodder for humorous commentary on their appearances.

A significant portion of the show revolved around listener calls and a discussion about memorable late-night commercials, focusing on a "Hey Love" soul music commercial and its tagline, "No, my brother. You gots to buy your own,"  which spurred reminiscing and discussions of other absurd commercials, particularly those for exercise equipment.  The show also detailed the upcoming "Cherry Darts" contest for an Xbox, involving listeners throwing darts dipped in Fluffernutter at a dartboard drawn on a woman's body at a gentlemen's club.  This segment also included discussion of a recent plane crash and the unusually low lottery payout due to many people playing the flight number, along with tragic coincidences involving 9/11 survivors.  The conversation frequently utilized offensive racial slurs, referencing blaxploitation films and other racially charged humor.

The show continued with a "unlucky lottery" segment featuring listener calls recounting improbable and unfortunate deaths, including those involving falling objects and bizarre coincidences.  Caller Vanjie challenged the hosts' assertions about who plays the lottery most.  The conversation took a vulgar turn with discussions about a woman's breasts and sexual acts, speculation about a plane crash, and the playing of a humorous, racially charged Delta Airlines commercial.  Further "unlucky lottery" stories were shared, including one about a woman hitting a decapitated body with her car.  The show also discussed the upcoming Michael Jackson 30th anniversary special, incorporating Linda Stassi's criticisms of Jackson and a prolonged, sexually explicit, and offensive bit involving song lyrics and crude sexual innuendo.  The segment ended with technical difficulties, including microphone and soundboard malfunctions, further fueling vulgar commentary and frustration. A Paisano of Mulberry Street commercial concluded this section.

The broadcast then shifted to the hosts' frustrations with FCC censorship, detailing instances of their content being cut, including a Garrison Keillor clip and their "alphabet game." They lamented the lack of clear FCC guidelines.  The conversation was laced with profanity and vulgar language directed at the FCC and "Alex." A phone conversation with Steve, a voice actor for Olympus Gym commercials, showcased his various character voices.  Callers Joe and Alex engaged in heated exchanges with Opie, the latter including insults about Opie's name.  The show also covered Paula Poundstone's arrest and played a partially-cut Ozzy Osbourne message.  The "Cherry Darts for the Xbox" contest was again discussed, with further details about the Fluffernutter.  The recurring mention of a broken channel ("five") on the radio board was highlighted.  The show concluded with a conversation with two previous contest losers, who were given consolation prizes and offered a chance to participate in the "Cherry Darts" contest, including complaints about previous winners and more profanity.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  And we're back with the O.P. and Anthony Show.  House and Chains. We're going to send that out to Sal, the van driver for WYSP in Philadelphia, Anthony.  Yeah. Why's that?  Oh, he almost killed us today on the way back to the train station.  Ben and I went down to Philly. We had a little business meeting we had to take care of.  Did you get the Coke back here?  Got the Coke back here, yes.  Nice.  For the secret room, Anthony.  Nice.  Got to bring some up to Boston.  We pulled in to Penn Station at 2.30, so here we go. 
[00:00:30]  Yeah, I know.  So we did this little, we were part of a business luncheon down there.  Business luncheon with program director Tim Sabian.  I was much too busy to be involved.  That's okay.  I was representing for both of us.  Yeah, very good.  And Tim Sabian just looking like a complete tool.  Was he?  Again?  With his slacks and his tie.  With his tie.  Did he have the tight ass showing slacks on like he did when we were up there last night? 
[00:01:00]  I do believe it was the same slacks that we saw when we went down to Philly for that live broadcast.  Yes.  He's like Fred Flintstone.  He's just got the one suit.  Yeah.  In the closet.  Oh, yeah.  Real tight slacks.  He had loafers on, a stupid tie, a jacket.  We'll just call him his ass slacks.  His ass slacks.  Because his ass, you've got to see him to believe him.  They really are so tight that it gives him a wedgie and that second ass region.  Well, that's because his underpants. 
[00:01:30]  What a nice word.  Underpants.  His underpants.  Say it to yourself.  It's a silly word.  Underpants.  Underpants.  His underpants are too tight.  Yeah.  So it makes like a mini ass within his tight slack ass.  His ass.  Right.  Right.  So he's standing up.  We're in the rock and roll business, aren't we, Anthony?  Yeah, I think so.  He looks like a complete corporate tool.  Well, you know.  Like he should be standing up talking about IBM or something.  Yeah.  Anything but rock and roll.  Anything but rock and roll. 
[00:02:00]  Yes.  So we did that meeting.  And to get back to Sal, the van driver for WYSP in Philadelphia,  Tim's like, hey, you guys got 15 minutes to catch your train.  But Sal's on the job.  He's the guy, the go-to guy when you're in a pinch for time.  Yeah.  So they gave us lunch to go.  That was a nice restaurant.  What was the name of that place, man?  We should make believe we're local today.  I have no clue.  It was an Irish place.  Irish place was on South and Front.  It was on the corner. 
[00:02:30]  That's all I remember.  There you go.  South and Front.  Local reference for Philly today.  That's all you need to know.  Local reference.  So they throw this to-go food and throw us in the van.  You're not even sitting in a seat, right?  I was in the back with all this equipment and crap in their Eagles van.  And they throw the food in with actual utensils, like not plastic ones.  So we jump in the van and he's got anthrax clanking.  I'm like, this is a bad sign.  And then he peels out. 
[00:03:00]  Dude, we ripped around the corner.  The cobblestones alone killed me.  Christ.  We ripped around the corner.  I was like, one of those things called you hang on to?  The OS bars or whatever?  This guy, Sal's a mad dude because we-  He's all right, though.  He's a good guy.  But we almost rear-ended an old lady.  Hold on.  I'll get there.  So then we peel out and you know that there's a lot of cobblestone streets in Philly.  Yeah.  You know something?  Do away with that.  I don't have to worry about kidney stones anytime soon.  Really?  Shook them loose?  Oh, they broke up everything inside.  It made a little ultrasonic vibration. 
[00:03:30]  It was-  As he's going about 70 down the cobblestone street.  Could we maybe pave over cobblestones?  I don't know if that historic, very nice, rustic look works in the 21st century.  Oh, you better talk to the Historical Society, Anthony.  Oh, please.  Pave it.  Oh, hey.  The restaurant was called Downey's.  Downey's, right.  There you go.  Downey's.  Okay.  So we peel out with anthrax cranking.  Sal at the wheel.  He goes, don't worry, guys.  You're in good hands.  I'll get you there.  So he's flying in.  And I think everyone can relate to this. 
[00:04:00]  When someone drives you somewhere, I go, oh, Sal, it's going to be one of these rides.  Don't you hate-  Yeah.  You know what one of these rides means?  I've been in those situations where you get in, the guy starts driving, and you're thinking  you had, oh, no, I could die in this.  Yeah.  I could-  Oh, no.  Remember when you used to get like, you're hanging out with your friends.  That used to happen all the time.  You'd hop in a vehicle.  They'd start driving, and you'd look and go, holy ass.  This is going to be one of those death-defying experiences.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  So we're flying.  Then you remember never to drive with the guy again? 
[00:04:30]  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  You're always to drive, you're like, no, I'm going to take my own vehicle.  Yeah, no, you make the mental note, because the anthrax is cranking, and we're flying,  and he's taking these turns, and I'm thinking to myself, there's no way in hell I would attempt  that turn at that speed.  I hope he knows what he's doing, because you're just convinced the damn thing is going to flip.  Yeah.  So we're flying, and the anthrax is cranking some.  So.  There they go. 
[00:05:00]  Oh, jeez.  That had a first.  So I decide maybe I'll start some small talk.  Maybe that'll slow them down a little bit.  No, that'll just distract them.  So I'm like, yeah, anthrax, your favorite band?  He goes, oh, yeah.  No, he said second favorite, right?  I go, well, what's your favorite band?  He goes, Alice in Chains.  All right.  He goes, I love the darkness and the self-destruction of Alice in Chains.  Oh, this is what you want to hear.  As we're going 80, yeah.  Around these turns, I'm like, oh, my God.  So we're, I'm white-knuckling it the whole way. 
[00:05:30]  So is Ben.  Ben is really freaked.  Oh, there's crap all in the back of this truck.  That is just flying all over the place.  So he, I don't even know what it was.  So we're on a three-lane highway, and he sees a space where he can maybe sneak through.  So he just guns it.  I swear, dude, we had to be going close to 100.  He realizes the hole closed too fast on him, so now he has to slow down.  I'm like, oh, my God.  We are going to freaking crash in front.  This old lady going maybe 50 in the center lane that we were going 100 trying to get faster.  Stops in time. 
[00:06:00]  I'm like, okay, okay.  So I'll make a long story short.  He drops us off at the Amtrak station there.  You should have just had him drive you here.  It would have been faster.  He told, I forgot to tell you, when we left the bar, he goes, dudes, I've made it to New  York in 45 minutes.  I'm like, oh, man.  I don't doubt it.  So we pull up in front of the joint, and now he looks at his watch.  He goes, yep, 35 blocks in three minutes.  New record.  35 blocks in three minutes. 
[00:06:30]  That's nice.  Now, they're not New York City type blocks.  You can move a little faster.  Yeah.  But there was a couple lights and stuff, 35 blocks in three minutes.  After you step out and you're alive, you are impressed by it.  You know what I mean?  So we didn't need the lunch because we had that queasy feeling, you know, when you're  in a car and it's stop and go, stop and go, stop and go.  It's called being carsick, yeah.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  Carsick.  So then we're taking the trip back, and Ben's snoring away. 
[00:07:00]  Packed freaking train, man.  Yeah, it was hilarious.  That's hilarious.  You had no clue.  Full train?  Yeah, full train.  Back to New York.  That's the payback for my ride down with the little kids sitting three seats behind me  screaming and yelling.  It's because no one's flying anywhere anymore.  The trains are all full.  We need a good derailing to get people off the trains now, too.  I want people walking by next week.  Kids should have, like, their own cart on the train.  Adults can go to the bar cart.  Kids can just...  Oh, thank you.  I've said this in every mode of transportation.  They have the silent car on Amtrak. 
[00:07:30]  Silent car.  They have a silent car.  The cone of silence.  They have a car.  You're allowed in there.  You can't use cell phones, nothing.  You've got to just keep your mouth shut.  That's pretty good.  And they police it really well.  Really?  So if you need to get some shut eye, if you're working in Washington, you're coming from New  York, boom.  I always said that on airplanes and whatnot.  I would pay extra to go on a flight that just...  That has no kids on it.  Because when you sit there and you hear...  Behind you, you're like, oh, yeah, that's cute.  Little baby talk.  You know, once those little ears start popping with the altitude, they're going to be screaming. 
[00:08:00]  And, you know, I paid as much as they did for their ticket.  Yeah.  Why should I have to deal with your goddamn mistake with your breaking condom?  Enough.  Let's go to Balloon Nod, Joe.  Hey, Joe, what's up, man?  What's going on, guys?  This Sal sounds like the white B.A. Baracus from the A-team.  I'll get you there.  He was cool, though.  I'll get you to drink, stay off the drugs. 
[00:08:30]  Stay in school.  Guys, you should have Sal race a black girl and have Sal and the YSP band.  It wouldn't even be close.  Black Earl's the negative.  He's the negative.  You guys have no clue how slow Earl drives.  It is unbelievable how slow the man can drive.  I've got to drive 88 miles an hour sometime.  Yeah.  Get my daughter in the morning of them.  He's the white B.A. Baracus.  Later, boys.  All right, man.  And then on the way down to Philly last night, that...  Oh, God, help me out.  I think he's a senator.  He's on CNN all the time. 
[00:09:00]  He's the guy...  There's a lot of them now.  No, you'll get it.  Or someone will get it.  He looks like John Goodman with dark hair, and he's really, really huge.  He is beyond huge.  Yeah, someone will get it.  I can't.  Someone's got to help me, because it was the train to Washington, so it looked like a lot  of these politicians decided not to fly yesterday.  Yeah, taking the train.  Same with Body by Jake decided he didn't need to fly.  Oh, what?  You saw Body by Jake?  Oh, yeah. 
[00:09:30]  Jake...  Smiling through the train station, because people are recognizing him.  He's all happy.  Body by Jake.  Bar!  And then one-legged Eddie from Big Brother, our pal.  You saw him?  Yeah, it was a lot of people.  On the same train?  Yeah.  And then a CNN reporter.  Yeah.  The guy with dark hair, younger guy with glasses.  And they were all going to Washington?  I guess, because that was the final stop of the train.  Boy, those shuttles are empty, man.  They dealt the shuttle to Washington.  And then, whoosh, this guy mumbleweeds down the center aisle. 
[00:10:00]  Dean, what's up?  Yeah, that's Jerry Nadler.  That's fat, the fattest congressman in the world from the Upper West Side, you're talking  about?  And he looks like, uh, uh, uh, uh, I, I...  It matters what neck you're looking at.  He looks like, uh, John Goodman, though, right?  Yeah, but he's probably a good 200 pounds heavier than Johnny Boy.  Yeah, and he looks like John Goodman and a little bit, uh, Chris Farley in him there.  Absolutely.  All right.  Flob.  Well, he was ordering a lot of hamburgers on the way down to Washington last night.  No, no doubt about it.  I've seen him get into a cab, and the thing, I couldn't believe it, the wheels stayed inflated. 
[00:10:30]  Yeah, real.  Later.  All right.  Bigger tool.  Bigger tool.  Body by Jake or Tony Little?  Oh, Tony Little by far.  Very good.  Okay.  Just tool, bigger tool alert.  Look at me!  My legs are off the ground!  That is, what, the Astro Glider?  Yeah.  Is it called the Astro Glider?  Yeah.  The Astro Glider.  You don't even got to move.  You just stand on it.  There's no way you get in shape with that Astro Glider.  Oh, no.  And then he's got the stupid baseball hat with his big ponytail pulled back.  Sticking out the back. 
[00:11:00]  He's just doing, come on, ponytail!  Right.  And he leads back.  Right.  He is a tool.  He really is.  He is an idiot.  Hey, Frank, what's up?  What's up, guys?  How are you?  God, I've got to take issue with you, calling all his corporate guys tools.  A lot of us stuck in offices having to wear monkey suits.  We're true believers in the O&A Army.  We just have to wear the suits.  Frank, maybe I didn't explain myself.  Right.  It ain't just the suit.  Yeah, here's a guy, Tim Sabian, like you just said it, you have to wear a suit, that's  what you do for a living, and you're probably not too happy about it.  No, I'm not.  And there's a lot of guys out there that are like you. 
[00:11:30]  And then there are some that enjoy wearing the suits, of course.  Tim Sabian is a guy that is in the rock and roll business.  You should not be wearing loafers, tight slacks, and a tie with a jacket.  Loafers.  The loafer look.  That's just pure laziness.  You don't want to tie your shoes.  Right.  But would he look more like Earl wear loafers?  With the little tassels.  The tassels.  How about penny loafers?  Where you slip the pennies in.  What the hell is that?  We should take up a collection. 
[00:12:00]  The first guy that takes scissors to Tim Sabian's tie.  Oh, no.  We'll give him some money.  He's got to loosen the guy up.  And then he has the tie all tight around his neck.  He can't even loosen his tie.  He would probably be very upset because I think he pays a lot for his ties and likes them.  Wouldn't he look more like a tool with a motorcycle jacket and long hair?  Well, there's got to be a common ground there.  Yeah, there's got to be some.  Like maybe a member's jacket.  He's like a member's jacket type of guy. 
[00:12:30]  Something like that.  A black member's jacket.  A member's only jacket.  A member's only jacket.  Sure.  Why not?  All right, guys.  Take it easy, man.  A member's only jacket.  And what kind of slacks?  Well, more like the, hmm.  Is he a Dockers kind of guy?  Yeah, like maybe some Dockers.  Sure.  Some Dockers.  Some tan Dockers.  And underneath the member's only jacket, a handsome sweater.  Nice cardigan.  A cardigan?  He's got to hide some fatness.  He doesn't fit in the sweater.  Okay, not a sweater? 
[00:13:00]  No.  Well, it could be one of those real bulky, I got it for Christmas sweaters.  I think.  You know those big sweaters you get from your aunt or something?  That you wear a couple times and realize how stupid you look and you're like, wow.  It's like the biggest goddamn sweater.  Maybe I'll just give this to the Goodwill.  Maybe you could wear one of those.  And then maybe some type of bowling shoe thing.  Like a different colors?  Like a hip shoe.  No, those bowling shoes that are out and around.  Yeah, there you go.  Rick's got them on.  Rick's got them on.  That'll bring the whole Tim Sabian I'm Cool outfit together. 
[00:13:30]  You know something?  I don't think it would work.  Well, he just doesn't, he doesn't come off as a cool guy.  He's nice enough, you know, cool guy to hang out with and talk to a little bit about the business.  He knows his S.  But as far as, he just looks like S.  He doesn't come off like the guy you want to just sit around and throw a few beers back with.  That's all I'm saying.  I like the guy.  Yeah.  Don't worry, Tim.  I see him tearing up over there in Philly.  By the way, you've got to make fun of Ben because Ben didn't go down last night. 
[00:14:00]  He went down this morning because he went to the Aerosmith show last night.  Yeah.  He shows up at my hotel because we're meeting Ken.  You went last night?  Yeah.  Right into the show.  Met up with Ken and Tim for breakfast this morning, right?  Yeah.  So Ben shows up at my hotel.  Here he comes.  Wearing a girl's sweater.  What?  What happened there, Ben?  Hold on.  He's wearing a girl's sweater.  So you might recognize what he has on right now as being something from the Opie wardrobe.  Yeah.  I'm ripping you off. 
[00:14:30]  Yeah, really?  I grabbed my girlfriend's sweater.  I thought it was mine.  It was dark.  And I looked like an idiot.  Dude, he shows up at my hotel and I'm like, how many hours sleep did you get?  This is a big meeting today.  How many hours?  Two?  I got like four or five hours.  You're right.  I've done that before, though.  You pack your clothes.  And if you live with a girl, that's what happens.  There have been times I grabbed her jeans and I went to get into them at the hotel room  the next day.  I put a leg in.  I put the other leg in. 
[00:15:00]  It was like a scene out of Big.  I fell on the floor.  I picked them up and when I noticed, oh, I tottered right over and just fell down.  So, you know, you're packing stuff.  You throw stuff in a bag when it's dark.  And I have a gray sweater and I'm looking and I'm like, oh, Christ, I look like a moron.  But you didn't realize you had the girl's sweater on until you were on the train.  Yeah.  Did it have a powder puffs girl on the front?  And then I spilled some on the jeans.  It had a cute little flower pattern to it.  Did it have a little kitten playing with a ball of yarn? 
[00:15:30]  And I'll tell you the truth.  If he didn't tell me it was a girl's sweater, I wouldn't have shown it.  You never would have known.  Not really.  But I show up and I'm like, great.  I look like a complete idiot.  We have this big meeting down here.  I spilled stuff on my jeans.  I'm pissed off.  But we had a lovely lunch with the bosses.  That's always fun.  Always nice.  God, I missed it.  Damn it.  Let's go to John.  John, you're next on the Opie and Anthony show.  John, what's up?  What's up?  You're up.  Yeah.  What is this guy?  A Latter-day Herb Tarlick from WKRP. 
[00:16:00]  Wow.  Good reference.  I think you got that.  I mean, I've never seen the guy, but the description, the picture I have in my head is frightening.  Baby.  He is.  He's like Herb Tarlick.  It was a rockin' station, KRP, but you had to have the guy behind the scenes.  I thought he was more like Mr. Carlson.  Mr. Carlson?  Gordon, you're more like Mr. Carlson?  He wasn't like the cool PD, though. 
[00:16:30]  With his mullet head or his Prince Valiant hair that he had.  All right.  Thank you, John.  Oh, thank you.  All right.  Hey, Dennis, what's going on today?  Yo, fellas, what's going on?  I'm Stoner Dennis.  Stoner Dennis, what's up?  Ah.  Yo, Anthony.  Yeah.  I was trying to figure out who might be more of a late-night junkie, you or me.  Tony, a little thing is called a gazelle.  Is it really called the gazelle?  Yeah, not the astral glider.  The gazelle?  Yeah, the gazelle.  That's the same thing, though. 
[00:17:00]  You get up in the feet and you hold on to the ski poles.  Oh, yeah, it's the same thing.  I just think gazelle's a stupid name.  And you go back and forth, and you're in midair.  You look like you're running in midair.  Yeah.  It's gay.  Ooh, the wind just falls off you.  Gazelle's gay, her name.  Hey, speaking of late-night TV, has anybody noticed they brought back one of my favorite commercials  of all friggin' time?  It's, I think the album's called Hey Love.  Hey Love.  Hey Love.  And it's black love songs.  So the couples, there's two couples sitting on the couch listening to Hey Love. 
[00:17:30]  And they scroll the bands by and the music that they do.  And you'll hear this one by, you know.  And then my favorite part at the end, and it's an old enough commercial where it was  vinyl at the time.  So at the end of the commercial, the two guys are standing face-to-face.  One's holding the big vinyl album.  He goes, man, this album's out of sight.  Can I borrow it?  And the other guy goes, no, my brother.  You gots to buy your own.  It was one of my favorite commercials of all time. 
[00:18:00]  They brought it back.  You have stumped me today.  Hey Love.  Oh, you watch how many people remember, no, my brother.  No, my brother.  You gots to buy your own.  John, what's going on?  What's going on?  I'm starting to talk black.  John, what's going on?  Hey John, what do you have?  That gazelle thing you're talking about, right?  Yeah.  My buddy works at a sports store, and he says they won't even put them together in the  store so people can try them out because they won't buy them.  And then when they do buy them, they won't let them bring them back. 
[00:18:30]  They have a policy.  Really?  Because they're that bad?  Yeah, they're that bad.  Yeah.  You know, I like to work out, try to keep myself in shape.  Yeah.  There's something with resistance that helps you get in shape.  Yeah, you can't do it.  There's no real resistance.  How the hell are you getting in shape?  Go in.  I like the electrocution thing they have now.  You slap the pads on, and you see the muscles going.  It's painful to watch that commercial.  They have gotten it to the point where they realize people hate to exercise, so they're coming  up with these contraptions where you don't have to do anything to get in shape. 
[00:19:00]  Just lay there.  Just put it on.  The pounds melt away as you sleep.  As it shakes your muscles?  Yeah, it's like tightening.  It's like you're getting electroshock therapy.  And that's it.  Anthony.  It's supposed to work the muscles.  Yes, sir.  Whatever happened to your coat rack?  I mean, home gym.  Actually, I joined a real gym.  Nice.  And, you know, I go to the real gym now.  Okay.  Which is a little easier than the home gym, which I did realize wasn't really doing much.  Sweet.  All right, John. 
[00:19:30]  All right, this bus sucks.  See ya.  What?  This bus sucks?  What?  I don't know.  It's like coded messages, I think.  John.  John, turn down your goddamn radio.  Sorry, dude.  Yo.  Listen, that commercial's been out for a good six months now, Ant.  Has it?  Yeah, man.  Hey, bro, you got to get your own.  And it's so funny.  The guy's got this big vinyl thing.  And you can tell he's got the big afro.  The commercial's ancient.  I mean, they didn't even update it.  You look like a CD now, you know?  Yeah.  My girlfriend was laughing at me because we're sitting watching it.  And I go, oh, my God, it's Hey, Love. 
[00:20:00]  And she's looking at me like, what are you a nut?  I go, no, wait for the end.  You gots to buy your own.  And it comes on, and she looks at me like, you're crazy.  How do you remember this?  It's a classic, man.  It's a classic.  It is a classic infomercial.  God, I don't remember this one.  And it was a goof, like me and Adam and Joe Curry, when we were just hanging around.  If anyone ever asked, hey, dude, can I just borrow your jacket?  I'm running to the store.  No, my brother.  You gots to buy your own.  It was one of my faves.  Sounds like that scene from Kentucky Fried Movie.  Oh, yeah.  Big Jim Slade. 
[00:20:30]  Big Jim Slade.  Big Jim Slade.  The wall, actually.  Grabs the guy's wife and starts plowing her.  All right, John, thank you.  Pete, what's up, bro?  Yo, I was just waiting on hold.  Well, you're on the air now, man.  Oh, hey, what's going on?  What's happening?  No, my brother.  Listen, you guys, you got to pay attention to the commercial.  They got the black velvet pictures in the background.  They got the green couch.  It's hysterical. 
[00:21:00]  It's two black couples sitting there.  Do you know, in that movie, I think it was in that movie, Say Anything, a long time ago,  they made fun of that commercial in there.  Did they?  Yeah.  Where he's teaching the kid kickboxing, and he tells the kid, no, my brother, you gots to get your own.  It really, it was a huge thing when it first came out.  That was like a big infomercial that everyone goofed on.  I'm completely clueless.  Oh, my brother.  And it's so funny, because the two black couples are sitting around, and they're all smooching on the couch and stuff, 
[00:21:30]  listening to Hey, Love.  And then the guys are just standing there like, yeah, that's great, my brother.  No, my brother, you gots to buy your own with the big pimp frigging hairdos and stuff.  Thanks, man.  Thanks, man.  Listen, listen, one more thing.  Yeah.  Go Jet, Sunday.  That's right.  Yeah.  Go Jet, baby.  J-T-S.  All right.  Thanks, bro.  Nick, what's going on?  Nothing much, fellas.  What's going on with you?  Hey, man.  We're having fun.  Not only is it Hey, Love Classics. 
[00:22:00]  Yeah.  You're forgetting the Hey, Soul Classics.  Hey, Soul.  Yeah.  The Hey, Soul Classics.  And that guy just before me mentioned it.  It's in Say Anything.  He's like, hey, my brother, can I borrow your Hey, Soul Classics?  And he goes, no, my brother, you must buy your own.  Oh, that's funny.  Wait until you see it.  You guys find that scene.  You will laugh your ass off with that.  Yeah.  Someone got to find it on the Internet and send it to us now.  Thanks, Mick.  Later.  There is a couple of the old ones they brought back.  I can't remember. 
[00:22:30]  I saw another one recently that I'm like, wow, that's an old infomercial.  And they brought it back.  Marshall Mason.  Listen to all the Soul Classics.  Hey, Jeff.  What's up?  The Shy Lights.  Hey, what's up?  Yeah, man.  Listen, that Tony Little thing, it's the gazelle freestyle, technically.  Yeah, all right.  And it's great whacking material, the commercial, actually.  Yeah, the lady on there is pretty hot.  Oh, man, real hot.  But Tony Little dorks it up pretty good. 
[00:23:00]  And Tony Little.  And he's got it.  You ever notice how they've got to grab the girls by the midsection in their ass to show them how it works?  Now, look at what it's doing to the glutes.  And he just grabs her ass, puts his hand on her abs, grabs her ass, and starts pumping her.  Yeah, it's an excuse to have funneled the women.  Yeah, let me just dampen my finger here.  Definitely a bigger tool than Stonko.  OB, F you, Anthony, I love you.  Thank you, Matt.  Wow, you're going to hurt my feelings today.  Sorry, O.  All right.  The Jets will collapse. 
[00:23:30]  They always do.  Well, Dave, what's going on?  Hey, OB, what's going on, man?  Listen to that voice.  Yeah, yeah.  OB, Anthony.  OB, OB with the dreadlocks.  What's going on, man?  Yeah, that's right.  Listen, OB, if you want to see these commercials, check out BET.  Any night during the week after 11, you're guaranteed to see the hey, love, hey, soul.  What's up with the BET, though?  I'm scared of BET.  Before I even turn it on, I lock my doors and set my alarm.  Why are you guys allowed to have an all-black TV channel? 
[00:24:00]  All-black?  That's more like an all-buffoonery channel, man.  You know, Stars has, like, black stars or black...  Yeah, and they just show black movies.  I saw another one.  Showtime's got, like, their own black Showtime.  Oh, yeah?  And they just show the black movies.  Well, I haven't paid for cable.  I saw Pulp Fiction on that the other night.  I was like, why is that...  It's not a black movie.  It's not a black movie.  There's black guys in it.  That's a movie for everyone.  Yo, man.  Oh, and Anthony, by the way, those guys in that commercial are very conservatively dressed.  Oh, I know.  No pimp afros. 
[00:24:30]  Not like the afros you had on the cover of Demented World.  Not that type of afro.  No one's sporting one of those, my friend.  I gotta go, guys.  What's up?  Peace.  Know, my brother.  You get all the hits on Hey Love.  Hey, man.  This album's out of sight.  Can I borrow it?  Know, my brother.  You gots to buy your own.  Which one's this?  The Seventy's Soul Experience. 
[00:25:00]  It's Soul.  This is Me and Mrs. Jones by Billy Paul.  You'll get all the classics.  I Can See Clearly Now by Johnny Nash.  You're still a young man, power of power.  And don't forget, Freddy's dead.  We both know that it's gone.  By Curtis Mayhew. 
[00:25:30]  You've got some funky tasting smoke.  Look at the pump, the pimp on this one.  Let it go now.  Who am I, Venus flytrap?  Oh, the classic soul.  Let it go now.  Let it go now.  Oh, jeez.  I don't want to get the eggs, fellas.  6.30.  And it's your pleasure in that big ass on a velveteen couch.  Holding hands.  Play some Hey Love. 
[00:26:00]  You've got some fans.  While the jukebox plays a favorite song.  Yeah, sing it out.  Me and Mrs. Jones.  Hey Love Productions.  Mrs. Jones.  It looks like I'm a wreck.  It's in the hole.  Mrs. Jones.  Hey, where'd you get this album?  I got it from a Negro.  Come on.  How about a good old nigger work song?  Oh, Micah.  How did a Blazing Saddles clip come up? 
[00:26:30]  Excuse me while I whip this out.  But it's much too strong.  Virgin.  Oh, no.  Help me.  Help me.  Help me.  Somebody help me.  Help me.  Help me.  We've got to be extra careful.  Yeah, baby.  I'm Big Dick Black. 
[00:27:00]  I'm Big Dick Black.  You don't want to hire any niggas, that's all.  You're, uh, the two.  Charcoal briquette.  A moulin yarn.  Let's all go home and find a nice white woman to make love to.  I'm the party people.  I was hit on your hands and knees like a dog.  That's it.  Crawl around like a dog. 
[00:27:30]  Hey Love.  Maybe to the park.  Shut up, dummy.  I have a seat on the bench.  Shut up, dummy.  To watch the children play.  Hey, man.  Hey, beautiful.  Tomorrow is their future.  Stay out the bushes.  Stay out the bushes.  Look what I did to you.  They all have around me.  They seem to know my name.  Don't just stare at it.  Eat it.  Tell a few jokes.  Yeah.  But it still doesn't ease my pain.  That's right. 
[00:28:00]  We've got Bush.  We've got Bush.  There is no racial bigotry here.  I do not look down on niggers, kites, whops, or greasers.  But today, again, I ride.  Ouch.  I think we're getting into a weird area here.  Oh, this song.  Yeah.  Remember this one?  I remember this.  I didn't know the whole, the first minute and a half of it, but hey, love.  All right. 
[00:28:30]  A little hey, love for you.  Hey, love.  All right.  We should take a break, huh?  Whatever happened to Revenge of Nigger Charlie?  That movie, right?  Yeah.  Earl.  Earl's an expert on blaxploitation movies of the 70s.  He knows them all.  There was The Soul of Nigger Charlie and Revenge of Nigger Charlie.  And I have the poster for The Legend of Nigger Charlie, which was great.  Remember the trailer for that?  Do we still have that somewhere?  Yeah.  I'll make it in there.  Goddamn.  Oh, you're going to find that? 
[00:29:00]  Yeah.  Oh, cool.  Those were sometimes.  Remember Blackula, Earl?  Yeah.  When they came out with Black Dracula?  They took, like, your run-of-the-mill movie, and then they put a black guy in there, and  all the black guys went to see it.  And this was, what, The Legend of Nigger Charlie or The Soul of Nigger Charlie?  I think it's Soul.  Could you imagine a movie like this coming out today?  Listen to this trailer.  Black cowboys roamed the plains. 
[00:29:30]  They couldn't read or write, but they sure could ride.  And shoot and kill.  They were men with souls.  Men like Nigger Charlie.  Now he rides again.  Soul of Nigger Charlie.  This time, Charlie's got an army behind him.  A whole damn army.  Stealing gold.  Green black brothers.  And out-smarting and out-fighting the entire West.  Nigger Charlie's on the loop again.  And this time, he's got his soul, brother. 
[00:30:00]  Watch out.  You, boy.  Nigger Charlie.  Mr. Nigger Charlie.  Mr. Nigger Charlie.  Paramount Pictures presents Rhett Williamson and The Soul of Nigger Charlie.  In color.  Rated R.

[00:31:00]  We've got to figure out how to get the contestants for Cherry Darts for an Xbox.  Cherry Darts.  Cherry Darts.  We'll give you those details next.  Stay there.  Opie.  I'm the Sweetheart.  And Anthony.  That's the A-hole over there.  You C-sucking F.  Cool jack-off-ass F.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Yeah, that's funny.  Yeah.  Yeah, we're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  Shining star. 
[00:31:30]  Yeah.  Earth, wind, and fire.  Yeah.  This stuff is great.  I'm Big Dick Black.  Yeah.  I'm moving you on.  Let's all go home and find a nice white woman to make look.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:32:00]  Look at her, man.  You're a filthy whore.  I'm a big girl, yeah.  See you after the show and start.  Woo!  You're a big girl.  Woo!  You're a big girl.  You're a big girl.  You're a big girl.  You're a big girl.  You're a big girl.  You're a big girl.  You're a big girl.  You're a big girl.  You're a big girl.  Like a white man.  His afro's getting bigger as we look at him.  All right.  A couple phone numbers in the New York area.  877-692-1027.  Anywhere else, 866-277-4.  Wow. 
[00:32:30]  Are we going to get to the bottom of how we're going to pick contestants for cherry darts?  Yeah, I guess we should.  We're doing it Thursday, right?  Yeah.  We got an Xbox to give away this coming Thursday, and we came up with this fine idea called Cherry  Darts for the Xbox.  Yeah.  Going to get one of the lovely ladies from Privileged Gentleman's Club to come down and help us out.  Once again.  And we're going to draw a dartboard on her body.  Somewhere.  Gee.  Just imagine what the bullseye will be, okay? 
[00:33:00]  Gee.  And then we're going to get a bunch of our listeners to come down, and they're going to dip their  little cherries into Fluffernutter.  I'm hearing Fluffernutter sticks nice.  Oh.  Marshmallow fluff.  Yeah, one of the listeners suggested that.  That would be better instead of whipped cream.  So we'll dip them in the Fluffernutter, and then they will shoot their cherry dart toward  the target, and whoever gets closest to the bullseye will walk away with the Xbox.  How's that sound, huh?  Beautiful.  Let's go to Frank.  Frank, what's up? 
[00:33:30]  What's up, guys?  How are you?  What's up?  I want to do the cherry darts.  You want to come from Philly and do the cherry darts?  I will take a train all the way up to New York to do the cherry darts.  Are you poor?  I live by the mall.  All right.  I never heard it put that way.  Okay.  Are you poor?  I live by the mall.  I live in a duplex by the mall.  Yeah, that's hurt.  All right.  You're our first contestant for cherry darts for the Xbox.  Oh, that easy.  That easy. 
[00:34:00]  Excellent.  Lives in a duplex by the mall, Anthony.  Do you play darts at all?  Are you a good aim?  I spend a lot of time in bars, so I play the occasional darts.  That's good.  So you think you'll be able to lob one in there for a bullseye?  You may have a shaky hand when you see this lady that we have.  I'm willing to give it a shot.  All right.  Hold on to the line.  You're going to be our first contestant.  Thanks a lot, guys.  All right.  Hold on.  It's this Thursday.  Remember, okay?  I'll be there.  All right.  Someone help him out with the info to get down here.  Scott, you're next to the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:34:30]  Yo, what's up, man?  I want to play cherry darts first of all, man.  Please.  You want to play cherry darts?  Yeah, no doubt.  I thought you were calling for something else.  Yeah, but I'm talking about the black exploitation thing.  I was really feeling that, yo.  You were feeling that?  You gave a nice tribute to black exploitation movies?  I was feeling that.  Look at us relating to the brothers today.  You missed a lot of flicks, man.  Hey, I'll talk about some.  How about Black Gestapo?  You remember that one?  Black Gestapo, Opie. 
[00:35:00]  Black guys, all dressed in Nazi regalia.  No way.  Proclaiming that they are the master race.  No way.  It's great.  Black Gestapo.  I'm looking for the trailer for that, by the way.  You can find that film in the science fiction section of Blockbuster.  Black Gestapo.  What happened to our brother?  I was going to invite him down for the cherry darts for the Xbox thing.  He hung up.  There's actually a line in there where they go,  Zig Heil, Mother F.  You know what? 
[00:35:30]  We need that clip for our radio show.  Adolph Johnson is the star.  Dude, I'm not making this up.  It is Black Gestapo.  It is from 1975.  Why is Earl giving me a book of...  That's Black...  Look at this book I got.  That's Black Exploitation.  Roots of the Badass Tude.  Rated X by an all-white jury.  The Black Godfather, Anthony.  1974. 
[00:36:00]  Here's some of the clips from Black Gestapo.  There's one part of the movie.  White dude drops the soap, Gestapo style.  They show a white guy in a bathtub.  Just, you know what's going to happen to him.  And pays with his family jewels.  Jewels.  Oh, yeah.  Urshie Dygert shows off her black ball handling.  This is some big-breasted white chick I'm looking at. 
[00:36:30]  Hey, are we allowed to read some of these on the air?  Sure.  I found one in Earl's book.  What is that?  Ah, from 1973.  The spook who sat by the door.  Which one is that?  What's the plot line of the spook who sat by the door?  There you go.  Take a save for yourself.  Ivan Dixon was the director.  Ivan Dixon and the producer.  You might remember Ivan Dixon from Hogan's Heroes.  That's right.  Along with the pimp.  What is the storyline of this one? 
[00:37:00]  I don't know.  Do you know, Earl?  I think it's a spy movie.  A CIA-trained black man with an agenda.  See?  Spy movie.  There you go.  I don't know why it's this.  Oh, you know what?  Spook is actually a code name for CIA.  So I think there was a play on words.  There you have it.  Jesse, what's up?  Hey, what's going on?  Hey.  I'm from Boston.  You guys rocked when you were here.  Oh, thank you.  What happened?  I got an idea for your X-Box.  Okay.  You know the chick from the lesbian coach with the man junk there? 
[00:37:30]  Oh, Rhonda.  Yeah.  Rhonda has the cleanest.  Yeah.  Instead of throwing cherries, you can play horseshoes.  Why not play horseshoes on Rhonda's cleanest?  There you go.  Very good, bro.  That's funny.  Look how they review Willie Dynamite from 1974.  New York's number one pimp, Willie Dynamite Short, don't be playing dat, let me take my hose 
[00:38:00]  on a field trip to the planetarium West Coast, hippie pimp ass, like Goldie be doing, in  the Mac.  He a cold-blooded, bidness-minded Mac who pop a hoe in da mouth in a minute if she ain't  right with dat money.  Willie, a capitalist practicing free enterpizer.  That's Willie Dynamite from 74.  Sure, Willie Dynamite.  Doug from Springfield.  What's up?  You know why that BET's on very late at night?  Whoever's watching it really doesn't have to go to work the next day. 
[00:38:30]  Oh, stop it.  Doug.  Doug.  Are you serious with all these names of old movies?  Oh, stop it, you.  We're just all having fun here talking about a little history.  And you gotta make a remark like that.  I'm sorry.  That's all right.  What does Earl have over there?  He hates those.  Oh, I know that.  What do you got?  Of course he does.  Oh, I thought you had something.  Okay.  All right.  Hey, Rick, what's up?  Hey, fellas.  Hey.  I can tell you all about the Thunderbird Drive-In.  It's down in Hollywood, Florida.  Okay.  And it's got 12 drive-in theaters there, and two of them show porno. 
[00:39:00]  I was down there in the late 70s.  And during the day, on weekends, they have flea markets there.  And me and my white trash father would have to get there real early with all the other white trash to get a good spot.  And across the highway from it was this huge black nightclub.  And it closed around the time people started showing up there.  And the people filing out looked like it was a casting call for a pimp movie.  And the nightclub closes. 
[00:39:30]  Darkie comes cruising.  And they used to rob all the people that were waiting in line.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Until some guy, a couple of cars behind us, shot one of them in the face.  And a guy came running past our van going, white folks got guns.  White folks got guns.  All right.  I am wringing his whole ball.  Rick, come on.  That's true.  Thank you.  You're welcome.  Thank you for the details.  Try to have a good historic...  That cannot be a real movie.  Is that a real movie, Earl? 
[00:40:00]  Cornbread Earl and Me.  Cornbread Earl and Me.  Starring Lawrence Fishburne.  Oh, yeah.  That's a young Lawrence Fishburne.  When he went by Larry Fishburne.  He was like 12 or something.  Lawrence Fishburne.  And Keith Wilkes.  Soul Cinema.  Cornbread Earl and Me.  Remember where Lawrence Fishburne on Pee-wee's Playhouse?  What was he?  Cowboy Curtis.  Cowboy Curtis.  Cowboy Curtis.  Ha ha.  Ha ha.  Ha ha.  Ha ha.  Ha ha.  Ha ha.  Ha ha. 
[00:40:30]  Ha ha.  Ha ha.  Oh, my God.  Which one's that?  Let me see.  The Black Klansman?  Hold on.  Hold on.  Don't curse.  Don't curse.  He was black and joined the Klan.  He dated the exalted Cyclops, Carol Ann.  In Sinister, we are the world, let me see, circle of robed Klansmen ring a blazing cross  in a remote Alabama woods. 
[00:41:00]  And, yeah, it was, well, black guy joined the Klan if you want to get the Black Klansman  from 1966.  Man.  Hey, Jerome, what's up?  So, I was wondering how you're going to hook up all your other fans that are, you know,  syndicated, or you have syndicated listening to you all over the place.  I don't know how I'm going to make it down on Thursday, just if I ever, you know.  Well, you know, most of our prizes are open for everyone, but, I mean, cherry darts for  the Xbox.  Come on.  That's going to make some good ratings. 
[00:41:30]  Well, that's pretty awesome, but, I mean, like, I can make it down there.  Plus, we'll have the pictures up on Foundry Music.  It's going to be fun for the whole family.  Well, how about, like, how people from Cleveland or something, you know, make it down there,  or if they, you know, if you pick them out.  We got someone traveling from Philly to come down Thursday to take a shot at the Xbox thing.  How about someone from Boston?  Can you make it down here Thursday?  Yeah.  Are you just saying that?  Yeah.  These are very valuable spots for the cherry darts for the Xbox competition. 
[00:42:00]  Yeah.  People fighting tooth and nail.  Are you sure?  All right.  If you can make it, we'll invite you down, but if you can't, you've got to tell me now.  You can't screw everyone else over.  Yeah, but I can't make it for three.  I mean, like, I could be there, like, at four or something, or, like, you know, 4.30.  Ah.  I don't know.  I don't know what your time limit time, you know.  Are you going to start the contest right away when the show starts?  The cherry darts competition will start at five o'clock Thursday.  Oh, I can make it for five.  You're not BSing, right?  I'm not BSing.  All right.  Hold on a line, okay?  All right. 
[00:42:30]  Well, we'll get Boston representing on Thursday.  We've got someone from Philly, someone from Boston.  That's good.  And, of course, a lot of New Yorkers.  As long as they can make it down.  Don't F with us.  All right.  Someone take care of Jerome and give him directions to the station from Boston, okay?  Mm-hmm.  So, what's the latest on the plane crash, Anthony?  Well, it certainly looks like it was some kind of mechanical failure.  It looks like the engines fell off.  I don't know how that happens.  Yeah, but they're finding, what, one engine in the bay and one engine at the gas station? 
[00:43:00]  It looks like both engines fell off before the plane crashed, which is a little strange.  You hear about one engine, maybe something flies out and knocks it off the wing.  But both engines fell off of this plane before it crashed.  And a piece of the tail was found in the water without any sign that it was hit with anything to knock it off.  I don't know.  Earl, you weren't supposed to bolt that thing together at the airport, were you?  No.  You think some bolts might have been unloosened? 
[00:43:30]  I...  I...  What do I know?  I just know that it seems a little strange.  Like, the investigators are saying that they're not sure they've ever come across anything like this before.  You could see one engine coming apart, something happens, bolts break, and the thing falls off.  Mm-hmm.  Theoretically, you're still supposed to be able to land when it's like that.  But when both engines fall off, nah, uh-uh, dead.  And, uh, that's what happened.  But there's some really tragic, uh, more proof that there is no God kind of thing. 
[00:44:00]  Two people that were on this plane, uh, somehow survived, uh, the World Trade Center disaster.  What are the odds of that?  One guy, uh, Felix Sanchez, he left his job on September 10th.  Meaning he got fired or quit?  Left his job at Merrill Lynch, um, September 10th.  And another woman, uh, Virginia Hernandez?  Mm-hmm.  Uh, no, that's her mother. 
[00:44:30]  Well, one woman.  Yolanda.  Whatever.  Hilda Yolanda.  She, uh, escaped from the ground floor restaurant where she worked in the complex.  So she was there when it happened.  She got out of the building.  Gets on a plane.  Plane crashes.  Would you play those odds in Vegas?  My God.  Then you're going to survive one disaster, but you're going to lose your life in the second one.  Two months later.  You know, that is insane.  You know, we were all a little leery about flying.  Especially now.  But after, uh, September, uh, uh, 11th, everybody was, was really freaked out about flying. 
[00:45:00]  Um, you would think if you were there and it happened, you would really be freaked out about flying.  Uh, I couldn't freak her out enough.  You know, one lady was saved.  Body by Jake is on the, uh, train, for God's sake.  And this woman gets to the plane.  All the politicians were on the Amtrak.  Amtrak's doing well, I can't believe.  Big brother Eddie.  He's on the train.  Uh, I was reading in the paper on the way back today that there was a lady that, uh, a stewardess.  She took that flight from New York down there to, where was it, uh, going to, uh, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, Santa Domingo. 
[00:45:30]  Yeah.  She's, she's done that, um, that flight hundreds of times.  After September 11th, she quit.  She was scared, endless of flying, and that's the only reason she is living to death.  Ah, there you go.  So there's other people.  You hear about the New Jersey lottery numbers?  Yeah, this is a sick, uh, little twisted, uh, let me read this really fast, okay?  For the people that aren't in the New York area, this is a huge story today.  New Jersey lottery number, same as doomed plane. 
[00:46:00]  Mm-hmm.  The winning number for a state lottery game was the same as the flight number of the plane that crashed earlier in the day,  and the payout was unusually low because of the high number of matches.  Yep.  You sick Fs out there.  A lot of people in Jersey played 587, uh, as the numbers yesterday.  Right.  And it came in, a prize that would normally be 275 bucks.  Right.  Only $16.  Right.  Was paid out because so many vultures went there and decided, uh, to, uh, uh, play those numbers.  That is, I didn't even think, hey, 587, let me play that. 
[00:46:30]  As a goof, I'm going to play the numbers.  Those are those hardcore number people that are always in front of you when you just want to buy a pack of cigarettes  or a goddamn six of beer or something.  Give me the five with the eight and the seven.  Give me the eight, uh, seven and a five.  Give me the 587 box.  Give me the eight with the seven and then box, uh, all the other numbers.  Give me the 587.  Get out of my way.  And you're behind them with a cup of coffee and a newspaper. 
[00:47:00]  Give me a win for life.  Ugh, too late.  You're a loser.  You've lost for life.  And then, yeah, the, I mean, there have been plenty of bits done on this, but it's true.  The old people that go up to play the win for life.  How many years you got left?  Enough already.  And you're taking up your time.  You're insulting my grandma right now, Anthony.  Is she one of those that plays all the time?  91 years old and plays the lottery every single day. 
[00:47:30]  It seems old people and minorities just love that lotto.  They live for it.  They live for it.  If I had a million dollars.  Stinky's cursing right now.  Song got stuck in Stinky's head yesterday.  I think it finally got out, like, after the show.  He goes back to the office, turns on the TV.  If I had a million dollars.  He just screamed the F word.  Oh, my God.  But, yeah, it's like old people and minorities.  They get up there, get in front of you, and you can't move.  You want to smack them in the head.  I like a, give me the lucky sevens. 
[00:48:00]  Lucky sevens.  No, because I'm having my seventh prostate surgery.  So it's got to be lucky.  Give me 587, because that's my cholesterol number.  Speaking of winning the lottery, Ant, there's also winning the unlucky lottery.  We've talked about this on our show from time to time.  Yeah, when the odds of winning something huge, you know how big they are, how hard it is to do something. 
[00:48:30]  It's almost impossible to win a lottery.  But instead of that, you meet the same odds, only for something horrific.  So here it is.  Worst feared for woman and son.  This is a real tragic story.  Anne-Marie was on the phone with her sister, Kathy, just as the doomed jet rumbled through the clear sky,  rattling the windows of both their homes in Bell Harbor, Queens.  Suddenly, there was a loud explosion, and Anne-Marie's phone line went dead.  Uh, she rushed outside and saw black smoke rising from her sister's house. 
[00:49:00]  They were talking about going shopping when the plane hit.  That's it.  Anne-Marie's secretary at the Brooklyn Diocese and her son are among at least six people on the ground from the Rockways  who were still missing last night.  That's how it happens.  So what do you want to do?  Do you want to go shopping?  Yeah, what store do you think?  I don't know.  I need shoes, and I need...  That's it.  You win. 
[00:49:30]  You win the unlucky lottery.  Congratulations.  You win all those houses.  What are the odds that you die because a jet lands in your kitchen?  How about the other story?  The family that the engine plowed through their house into the backyard?  Yeah, a little family.  A father, mother, and a kid.  And they're in their house.  All of a sudden, a jet plane engine comes smashing through your house.  Knocked them into different rooms. 
[00:50:00]  Knocked them outside the house.  And the father, you know, makes sure the mother and the kid are okay.  Looks out in his backyard.  There's his garage on fire because it seems a jet engine went through his house and hit  his garage and lit on fire.  How the hell...  You're just sitting, enjoying life on your day off, and something that cataclysmic happens.  And what are the odds that it's going to hit your house, you know?  You're just sitting. 
[00:50:30]  Oh, the jet engine.  I didn't order a jet engine, did I?  Honey?  Honey, did you order the jet engine to smash through our house?  No?  Oh, man.  You win the unlucky lottery.  Happens all the time.  Happens a lot in New York.  Remember the old lady that died because a crane fell and went right through her apartment?  Yeah, she was just, uh, she was just sitting in her bed watching soap operas, I believe. 
[00:51:00]  Watching soaps.  Minding her own business.  Watching soaps.  Feeling nice and safe and warm in her little bedroom.  Marlena, you are mine.  I will make you my queen of the night, Marlena.  I love this program.  This is wonderful.  I hope Marlena doesn't get caught again by Stefano.  Marlena, you will come with me.  Screw John Black.  Oh, what happened there?  She was just watching her soaps.  And a construction crane falls right through and kills her.  Hello? 
[00:51:30]  Did you order the big crane through your ceiling?  Hello?  Hello?  No.  That's how it happens, though.  How about that poor woman who, uh, the good Lord must have mistaken her for the coyote in  the Roadrunner cartoons.  She's driving down the road.  Meep, meep.  And a boulder, which had probably been on hilltop on the side of the road for millennia.  Marlena decides that's the time it's going to roll down and roll over her car. 
[00:52:00]  It decides to roll.  What are you doing?  You've reached the pearly gates.  You can't be happy about that.  The hell am I?  The coyote?  You rolled a rock that had been sitting there through ages.  Yeah.  That rock up on that mountain probably saw dinosaurs.  And it picks you driving by at that second.  At that moment, gravity has to take hold.  To roll over your car.  What about here in New York with the, uh, the, the things, the, uh, the, uh, the... 
[00:52:30]  The manhole covers?  The manhole covers that pop up for no reason.  That explode, blow up.  You're walking down the road.  Flying up in the air and coming, and they come down on your head and kill you.  Whistling.  There's at least one of those.  Oh!  What happened there?  There's at least one of those a year.  Yeah.  Oh.  It's a cruel old life, man.  What about, uh, the, the lady at the Harley-Davidson, uh, cafe?  Oh.  She got hit by the falling guy.  But that was a near miss.  She, she survived, thank God. 
[00:53:00]  Oh, physically.  How do you, how do you go on emotionally when a man throws himself out a 40-story window,  I believe it was.  This was two blocks from where we broadcast from, and hits you on the shoulder on the  way down.  Yeah, she's just walking, minding her own business, maybe doing some errands, uh, around lunchtime.  Yeah, yeah.  And, uh, yeah, this guy pretty much takes out her whole right side of the body.  Just jumps out of a window, uh, in pure selfish fashion.  If you're gonna kill yourself, do it on a bridge where you're not gonna hit people.  And then she has to check out the sidewalk pizza. 
[00:53:30]  Yeah, yeah.  That is his remains.  People come apart real good.  And, uh, he did.  And there it is.  She's gotta deal with that the rest of her life.  Amazing.  Oh, man.  It's called the unlucky lottery, Anthony.  The unlucky lottery.  The same odds, probably even more so, uh, as it takes to win the lottery.  But you don't win the lottery.  You win the unlucky lottery.  Vanjie has a problem with us today.  Vanjie.  Yes, how you guys doing?  How's my sister doing? 
[00:54:00]  Okay.  Anthony, I heard that comment.  What's up, man?  Old people and minorities.  Hey, love.  Hey, you mean to tell me, you guys don't play the lotto?  Lonely girl.  Lonely girl.  Oh, goodness.  Vanjie.  Oh, look at that.  I think I got to Vanjie.  Oh, yeah, your music.  Baby.  Vanjie.  Yes.  All I know is when I'm late for a train and I just want to pick up my coffee and a piece  of paper, a paper, there are a lot of minorities in front of me playing the lottery. 
[00:54:30]  So you mean to tell me you guys don't play the lotto?  I see more minorities than white people.  Answer the question.  What, playing lotto?  Yeah.  We played the Ken Stevens lotto and hit in July.  My 91-year-old grandma plays a lotto.  Yeah.  There you go.  I never really played the lotto.  He's an elderly person, but you're just saying, old people and minorities, that ain't fair.  Then when we become rich, then you'll be complaining.  Hey, Vanjie. 
[00:55:00]  Yeah.  That's a great album.  Do you mind if I borrow it?  No, my brother.  You gots to buy your own.  Hey, do you remember a guy, Vanjie, named, here in New York, named Curtis Sharp?  Curtis Sharp.  Curtis Sharp was the black guy that won the $5 million.  Oh, yeah, the first guy.  Years ago.  Yeah.  And the first guy that won the $5 million was a white guy.  I can't remember his name.  Oh.  But then the black guy that won, Curtis Sharp, and he was dressed like the Mac Daddy Pimp.  Yeah, and he bought his wife and his girlfriend and everybody. 
[00:55:30]  He had a derby on and the suit.  And he goes, I won $5 million.  I thought it was $10.  No, it was $5 million.  Oh.  $5 million.  $5 million.  Curtis Sharp.  And he went through that money in, what, two years?  Yeah.  Something like that?  Well, I know he wound up in debt on everybody and their mother.  You know what?  He totally went out of control.  He got himself a pussy.  Well, that's true.  He got himself a pussy.  But see, that had nothing to do with him being a white guy.  Curtis Sharp.  No, and then the white guy still has the money. 
[00:56:00]  Well, see, that's just somebody that just does not act when they get money.  But not everybody's like that.  Not all of us are like that.  I understand.  What's your game of choice, Vanjie?  As far as a lotto or what?  Yeah.  I played a lotto in the three and the four.  But you know what?  My dad's favorite number was 857.  Oh, yeah?  And I used to play that.  Well, I do play that.  And I've hit on that a couple of times.  I've hit.  Vanjie.  Vanjie's a brick house. 
[00:56:30]  She's my to my to.  I'm just letting it all hang out.  Vanjie's a brick house.  It's how.  How.  How.  With that little vroom.  Ow.  Ow.  All right, Vanjie.  Vanjie.  All right, you guys.  Take it easy.  We'll talk to you soon, all right?  All right.  Represent.  Chris, what's up?  Yo, let's talk about this just for a second, man.  Yeah, what?  Yeah, you guys yesterday had cleanest lady on, and you guys gave Anthony the hardest time 
[00:57:00]  about, oh, oh, oh.  He wasn't talking about the, oh, oh, oh.  You never do that.  We know that.  Everybody knows that.  Right.  But just imagine if you were, okay, you got a Mike and I candy.  Everybody knows what Mike and I are, right?  Yeah.  Okay, you got the round end of the Mike and I.  Just imagine taking your top lip and taking your bottom lip and wrapping it around the top  of the Mike and I.  And then taking your tongue and moving it back and forth on the top of the Mike and  Ike.  A Mike and Ike?  Oh, good and plenty.  So basically, Chris, what you're trying to say is you just saw Ronda's Cleanest on Foundry 
[00:57:30]  Music.com.  Okay.  And you don't think it's that bad?  No, it's bad, but you don't.  But what Anthony was saying was that it kind of demands the attention because how big it  actually is.  All right.  I got you.  Well, I made the mistake of kind of doing the, oh, oh, oh, yesterday.  Oh, no, I wasn't saying that.  I was saying you'd never do that.  Right.  I was saying that with a normal girl, there is something you do with both lips and a tongue  that doesn't involve blah, blah, blah.  With her, that same act would involve blah, blah, blah, because it's huge. 
[00:58:00]  It's like a pinky.  The cleanest.  Well, check it out for yourself on FoundryMusic.com.  It's still up there.  And the first white guy with the five million was Lou Eisenberg.  Remember him?  No clue.  Lou Eisenberg.  No clue.  Lotto winner from many years ago.  All right.  We'll take a break.  Yeah.  And we'll continue.  But yeah, if you want to check out Rhonda's Cleanest, go to FoundryMusic.com.  A lot of people couldn't check it out yesterday because we crashed the site.  Yeah. 
[00:58:30]  You can go to OpieAndAnthony.com to find that link as well.  Okay?  Yeah.  And action.  I can't go one afternoon without spanking my junk.  Okay.  Terrific.  And cut.  Opie Anthony.  I will ever be the Kid Rock forever.  The latest single from Kid Rock forever.  As we rejoin the Opie and Anthony show.  It's all right.  I kind of like this new Kid Rock. 
[00:59:00]  It's aight.  It's no bop with a bop.  No.  It's nothing like dudes.  It's aight.  It's aight.  It's aight.  Getting a lot of examples of the unlucky lottery off instant feedback, Anthony.  Yeah.  You know, you can win the lottery, which is a really fun thing.  The odds are against you, of course.  But then again, you can win the unlucky lottery.  And the consequence usually means your life.  Yeah.  Your life.  You win an unusual death. 
[00:59:30]  You win.  That's what you win.  Well, that's why we call it the unlucky lottery.  How about Dawn from PA writes,  unlucky lottery?  How about the priest giving last rites at the World Trade Center?  Wasn't he killed by a falling body?  Mike Judge.  Oh, no.  That's awful.  He's given last rites, okay?  He takes off his little hat there.  His little fire helmet.  And, yeah, a body hits him and kills him.  Which, by the way, hasn't really been reported on the news.  That's awful. 
[01:00:00]  They just say he died from fallen debris.  Debris.  And they say if he didn't take off his fire helmet to give the last rites, he might have  survived the body hitting him.  That's the unlucky lottery, my friends.  Gene writes, speaking of unlucky lotteries, what about how the great Stanley Kubrick died?  Driving down the road in an effing pole goes through his skull.  Oof.  Was that him or another director, though?  That was another director.  I think it was another director.  Kubrick just died of some natural thing.  Yeah, but it did happen to another director. 
[01:00:30]  Someone will come up with the name.  He's driving down the road.  It was the Long Island Expressway, wasn't it?  Yeah.  And someone...  A pipe was laying in the road.  Someone ran it over, making the pipe flip up.  And he's just driving...  Goes right through his windshield.  Right through the windshield.  Into his skull.  Eesh.  Stewie from Staten Island writes, I got a better one.  One lady was going to kill herself because her husband was cheating on her.  And when she threw herself out the building, she landed on her hubby.  Killed him.  She survived. 
[01:01:00]  Oof, true story happened in the Netherlands or some Euro country.  I never believed those.  It's like when I go to websites and I see UK.  Like, instead of just .com, you see the UK in there.  It's bold of me.  I don't trust the English media at all.  No.  No, it's all fake.  I got that mirror and...  It can't be all fake.  It's all fake.  How could it be all fake?  It's a country of fags.  All right, how about this one?  Jenny from Jersey writes, what about the woman who was hit by a Thanksgiving parade balloon? 
[01:01:30]  Yes, she survived.  Well, now she's got...  Oh, man, she's in bad shape.  She's got some brain problems, though, now.  You're just going to go to the...  Brain damage.  You're going to go to the Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade.  You're with your family, your hubby.  You find a good spot right on the parade route close to the road.  Here comes, what was it, the cat in the hat.  Cat in the hat.  Here comes the big, tall cat in the hat coming around the corner.  There's a light pole over you with the light just kind of sticking out over the road. 
[01:02:00]  A little windy that day.  They have some of these Macy's employees that don't really know anything.  They're just holding the ropes like they do.  It gets a little windy.  The big cat in the hat balloon hits the light fixture.  It spins around, cracks, and falls on her head.  Now she's like, I'm in the...  She's a mess.  Sure, the family got a bunch of money and everything, but, you know, you just went to go see the parade.  But she won the unlucky lottery.  What are the odds of that? 
[01:02:30]  How many people go to see the parade every year?  And Matt from Philly has one.  How about the unlucky lottery?  Richie Ashburn hit the same lady twice at the vet.  Is this really true?  Does anyone know about this?  He hits her in her seat.  Okay.  Now they're taking her out in a stretcher.  Or he falls off another one and hits her again.  What are the odds of that happening?  None.  Oh, my God.  Anthony, you're next on the O.P. and Anthony Show. 
[01:03:00]  Hey, what's up, guys?  How you doing?  Pretty good.  I guess a little off the subject.  Well, we're talking about a bunch of different things.  I figured Anthony would appreciate this similarity.  Fourth of July weekend in Amityville when the mayor is trying to get the people back in the water.  Amity.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Which was.  Oh, right, right.  It's Fourth of July.  And everyone gets in the water, and what, the kids play the prank when everyone gets crazy, right?  No, he actually sent them in.  He told Brody not to close the beaches. 
[01:03:30]  We have caught and killed a large predator that has injured a couple of bathers.  Tell everybody, okay, fly.  It's all right to fly.  Yeah, yeah.  Get back in the air.  Get in the planes.  Everything's fine.  We've caught and killed.  All right, I gotta go.  Take it easy.  What the hell is happening at your house?  I don't know.  What happened?  What's the matter?  I think my boss just cut a finger off.  What?  I think we're right, dude.  Oh, that's so fake.  All right, take it easy.  Have a nice life, douche.  Yeah, there they were, telling everybody to get back in the air. 
[01:04:00]  Everything's fine.  Boy, the airline industry really, really didn't need a regular old air crash.  They're saying, though, if this is terrorism, it's all over for the airlines.  It is, like, over.  Yeah, they still haven't ruled it out.  They're leaning toward, really strongly toward an accident.  Are they leaning toward my flock of seagulls theory?  No, they're leaning toward some kind of a mechanical problem that they've had.  Some of the flight attendants that have flown on this Airbus 300, they've called it the Scarebus 300. 
[01:04:30]  Because there have been engine problems with this thing in the past.  But the thing that strikes me as weird is two engines falling off a plane.  It just doesn't really happen.  And then the plane coming apart like that is kind of strange, too.  I know when planes are at high speed or they're crashing from high altitude and really get the speed up, the thing comes apart at the seams.  This thing wasn't even that high up. 
[01:05:00]  Like 1,200 feet up.  Something ridiculously low.  Just short of 3,000.  2,700.  And both engines come off.  The tail flies off.  The wing falls off.  It's ridiculous.  Yeah, I know.  Dan, what's up?  You're next on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Fellas.  Hey.  Hey, I got this commercial for you.  It's an Ebonics commercial for Delta Airlines.  Oh, homie Delta.  What's that?  Homie Delta. 
[01:05:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  You guys get that?  Yeah, we play that.  I know I got it from somewhere.  Somebody gave it to me and I didn't know where I got it from.  Oh, we've been playing that for years.  Yeah.  Throw it on again.  This mixes both of the things you guys are talking about right now.  Yeah, it has that black exploitation and flying.  So sure.  There you go.  Throw it on.  Here it is.  Homie Delta.  There you go, fellas.  Thanks.  Y'all be going on vacation?  See, the thing is, if you about to be up out this bitch, check it.  Peep Delta.  We be flying all over this bitch.  Let me ask you something. 
[01:06:00]  You fin to raise up and get your travel on?  From the interior to the exterior, you've got to get your posterior in one of these big-ass  planes.  You dog.  You lay in the cut straight sitting on your ass and getting your drink on and your snack  on while we floss and fly this mofo all over this bitch.  East Coast.  West Coast.  It don't matter.  Nia, we'll get you to your ho and back lickety splits.  No s***.  Then you'll be back at your crib chilling with a flat spliff, thinking we were some crazy-ass  angel.  Hell, these fat, round, thick-ass vessels run up in the sky so deep, it'd be crying. 
[01:06:30]  Yeah.  You thought it was rain.  So bring a towel, because at Delta, it's laid out like that.  Call one of these fly-ass Delta coochies, and make all them punk-ass co-workers of yours  catch the vapors as you be off and about.  You going?  We fly you there.  You been?  We done already flew up in there.  We got you covered like a Jimmy hat.  At Delta, we loves us some flying, and it'd be showing like a mothaf***er.  I love that one.  Isn't that great? 
[01:07:00]  The homie Delta.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Eric, you're next to the show.  What's up today?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  You guys, I think, forgot the greatest blaxploitation film of all time, Dolomite.  What's Dolomite?  Dolomite's the pimp who got let out of jail, right?  Yeah.  So he can save his nightclub with his kung fu hose.  I never heard of that one.  You never heard of that?  Oh, it's classic.  And then at the end, there's the big scene where he pulls out his whitey counterpart's  heart, but it's like fist cut, heart in hand, blood off. 
[01:07:30]  Like, weird thing.  Really?  Hilarious, man.  He's got the kung fu hose.  All right, we'll have to check out Dolomite.  Dolomite.  Thanks, Eric.  Word.  Word.  Word.  Word up.  Cameo.  Yes.  Jimmy, you're next.  What's up?  Hey, what's up, fellas?  Talk about unlucky lottery.  CNN today, they had some chick with a glass eye gets into a ballroom brawl in Pennsylvania,  gets shot in the good eye.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I heard this story, man. 
[01:08:00]  This is just, maybe this broad ought to stay out of the bars where gunfight might erupt.  You know she didn't have teeth to go.  Here it is.  It is Kenneth Square, Pennsylvania, just outside of Philly.  Suburb of Philly.  This woman, Sandra Pearson, 42, struck as she's sitting at a table beside the bar where men  were sitting.  They got into a barroom brawl and the shooting started.  She has a glass eye.  The bullet hits her in her good eye. 
[01:08:30]  Pearson, hysterical, is yelling, I can't see.  There's blood all over.  And she grabbed her eye.  And now, looks like she's going to be totally blind.  The unlucky lottery happens all the time, man.  You got the two eyes.  It's like we said with the plane with the two engines.  You get the one engine goes.  You know, you could still function, hopefully.  But you really got to take care of that good engine.  When you have one eye, I wouldn't go anywhere that I might get my other eye shot out. 
[01:09:00]  The unlucky lottery, man.  Another example of the unlucky lottery.  Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Wrong song.  Which song?  Oh.  I forgot which one it was now.  I messed up the whole bit.  No.  Yeah, that's the one.  I'm still trying to figure out what's going to happen. 
[01:09:30]  The unlucky lottery.  Ah, ah, ah.  You just signed a giant radio contract.  Because you are the premier talk show host in the United States of America.  The Rush Limbaugh Show.  Excellence in Broadcasting Network.  When all of the sudden, your ears cease functioning.  And you thought like this. 
[01:10:00]  Make it to the badmimba, though.  I'm going back to the badmimba.  And I can't mean no more.  Am I calling on the net?  Am I?  Talent repossessed by God.  There was no downtown.  My ears don't want no more.  So tired to disappear.  All my favorite places. 
[01:10:30]  Rush, you got a phone call.  Are we in Camerto?  Rush.  We're in Camerto?  Good.  That ought to hold a little.  Been for a while.  No, no, no.  Rush.  Rush.  Line one.  Phone call.  Right?  About the plane crash in the Rockways.  It did where?  Who?  You heard that?  How do you hear that?  I know.  What?  I'm just sitting here in my studio. 
[01:11:00]  Rush.  What's that?  Rush, watch out for the plane.  I feel the nino bumbling.  Rush.  Something bumbling.  Plane.  Heading right toward you.  Rush.  I don't hear that.  Rush.  Rush.  What was that?  I think I thought of my men.  That poor guy.  That's definitely unlucky lotto.  That's the unlucky lottery.  Tony, you're next on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  What's up?  What's up, guys?  Hey.  Years ago.  Remember Vic Morrow's filming that, like, Vietnam-type flick? 
[01:11:30]  Oh, it was Vic Morrow.  Wrapping up, um...  Twilight Zone, the movie.  Yeah, the last scene.  Supposed to be what?  Like a rescue scene?  Wop.  Yeah.  Well, hold on.  Snow down.  I don't think it was supposed to be the last scene.  It just turned out to be the last scene.  Yeah.  My bad.  My bad.  My bad.  Yo, remember Dolop?  Oh, dude, Anthony, you have action?  You have cable vision?  Of course.  Action pay-per-view.  They're showing, like, a bunch of old retro movies.  Fat City's gonna be on soon.  With Stacey Keach. 
[01:12:00]  Yeah.  Plays the punch-drunk white boxer.  Classic, dude.  Check it out.  Action pay-per-view this month.  All right, Tony.  Thank you.  Hey, guys.  All right, boy.  Evan, what's up?  Hey, how are you?  The guy who got the pull through his head on the L.I.U.  was Alan J. Pakula.  Yeah, yeah.  He got the pipe through the head.  And he directed, uh...  JFK, was it?  All the President's Men?  All the President's Men.  Right?  Yeah.  Yeah, and also, about the unlucky lottery, how about those people that have the building  facades fall on them?  Oh, my God.  That's another one. 
[01:12:30]  You're just casually walking down the street after grocery shopping, and all the bricks  from the side of the building decide to give way?  They're just gonna fall down on you as you walk.  Building that's going on.  Yeah, and the last one was those people that were in town for that big prayer thing,  and it was, like, at the garden, and they rented out the...  Oh, no, no, no.  It was a hotel across the street from the garden, yes.  And a brick falls off the top of the hotel, and did it kill the guy?  Yeah, yeah.  Or was it more brain damage?  No, no, it killed the guy. 
[01:13:00]  Yeah, just a brick falling off the building.  What are the odds?  That's awful, man.  That's the unlucky lottery, my friend.  Okay, later, tools.  All right.  Superman getting paralyzed.  You know something?  I gotta tell you, I was watching Superman 4.  Awful.  Watching it last night.  And there's that scene where the nuclear man scratches Superman, and he gets really sick,  and they show Superman at one point all aged, like they made him up. 
[01:13:30]  But he looked better as the aged, sickly, dying Superman than he does now.  Swear to God.  He looked better as the aged, dying Superman in Superman 4 than he looks now.  Yeah, something's going on with him.  Like, he's...  I don't know.  His hair...  He's losing hair in a way that guys don't lose their hair.  Yeah.  Like, the top is okay.  He's losing on the sides first.  On the sides, yeah.  And he's got this little, like, froggy from the little rascal's hair on top of his head. 
[01:14:00]  And he's got no eyebrows.  And he's still...  I'm convinced it's his wife getting back at him when, you know, when he was the young  stud in Hollywood making all those Superman movies.  Maybe.  He was a womanizer, and now his wife is getting him back.  Yeah.  Giving him really bad haircuts and stuff.  And I do think I'm going to be able to...  Oh.  And I think someday I'll be able to walk.  I'll pump my lungs up so I can say another sentence. 
[01:14:30]  How awful a life.  Oh, poor bastard.  Mike, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey, man.  Hey.  Hey, back to Stanley Kubrick.  You guys were talking about how he had a weird death.  He didn't die with that thing to pull through his head.  No, I know.  The weird thing about his death was, you know, Stanley Kubrick's most popular movie is 2001.  Right.  He died 666 days before January 1st, 2001.  Oh, God.  Are you one of those number freaks? 
[01:15:00]  No.  I like Stanley Kubrick, and I just remember reading that in an article later on where someone  pointed that out, and that just stuck in my head.  Right.  All right.  All right.  Later, guys.  Thank you, Mike.  No problem.  Bye.  We've got to take a break here, but we'll squeeze Ian in.  Ian, what's up?  Hey, how are you doing?  I've got an unlucky one for you.  Yeah.  A couple's honeymoon.  They go to the Grand Canyon, and the wife's taking a picture of the brand new hubby, and  he falls in.  He dies.  Stop. 
[01:15:30]  I swear.  I swear.  You mean like, all right, step back, step back, step back.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Look good.  Look good.  And then he went in.  That's not unlucky.  That's a push.  That sounds like an urban legend.  And, Oop, you know you got the Flock of Seagulls story?  The Flock of Seagulls theory, yeah.  Theory, theory.  All right.  And the wedding singer, Adam Sandler, when he's purchasing a ticket to get on the plane  at the end, the guy working the, whatever, giving the stubs out, has his hair done like 
[01:16:00]  the Flock of Seagulls guy, and he says, hey, do you like Flock of Seagulls?  And Adam Sandler's like, no, but I can see you do.  And I believe they get on an Airbus.  All right.  There you go.  Hey, Ian, thank you.  All right.  I enjoy Real Rock TV every week.  Thank God.  Thank God we took his call.  What is this, Rick?  This is Christopher Reeves talking about stem cell research.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, God.  The first fact is that 100 million Americans stand to benefit from all kinds of stem cell research. 
[01:16:30]  Is that right?  And for some patients, like ALS patients, it's the only hope.  The only?  The second fact is that for 40 years, fertility clinics, which have to be licensed by the state,  have routinely been throwing out excess fertilized embryos into the garbage.  Today, one in six American couples are using fertility clinics.  And second of all, it's big business. 
[01:17:00]  Just one try, $25,000.  We don't want to create embryos just for research.  Turn it off.  We don't want to just be selling the garbage.  So I'm looking at the side of the thing.  I'm looking at how many people have lives to be saved.  And I think that one of the greatest things I've ever been put to do is to take this opportunity  to say, I know that during the campaign, I said I was against embryonic stem cell research. 
[01:17:30]  But now I've listened to everybody on all sides, and I've changed my mind.  And that would be so great.  That would really endear Indian American people.  All right.  Enough of that.  All right.  We'll regroup.  Just watched him as Superman last night.  Isn't that awful?  Did we replay with the music in the background?  Oh, God. 
[01:18:00]  No, no, no.  Oh, my God.  Ah, that's awful.  Should have thought of it sooner.  Yeah, exactly.  Timing is everything.  Right.  All right.  We'll talk about the Taliban next.  And Xboxes.  Yeah.  And wow signs at WWF live events in Boston.  Yeah.  Lots still to do.  Stay there.  Some days, you know, we're a laugh riot.  And other days, we just flat out suck.  We know it.  Interesting and true.  Opie and Anthony. 
[01:18:30]  And you're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha.  Mm-mm.  That's clutch.  Careful with that mic.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Mm-mm.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  It's moving right along.  Amanda.  What's up, Amanda?  I have a great unlucky lottery story for you.  It happened to me.  An unlucky lottery story.  Go ahead.  Yes.  I brought my ex-boyfriend, who our exes at the time, to see his favorite band Goldfinger play. 
[01:19:00]  And on the way home, I hit a dead body.  Whoa.  A human.  You hit a dead body on the way home from a rock show?  Yep.  And the weird part about it is the next year, the same band played the same club the same  day.  Yeah, that's weird.  Isn't that weird?  No.  I've messed up, like, ever, but...  That's something.  So, uh, who was the dead body?  It was a 19-year-old kid who was drunk driving, and he hit a tractor trailer truck.  He went through the wind field, was decapitated, and had no arm. 
[01:19:30]  And they never found him until you hit him?  Yeah, I hit him, and six other cars hit him, too.  Oh, so he was in the crash earlier in the night?  Yes, he was.  And I was lucky enough to run over him.  All right.  Did you have to wash off stuff on your car?  Oh, I, no.  I, they took my car away.  Oh, really?  Yeah, I went to the police department after that.  It was, it was terrible.  It was a horrible thing, but I think that's pretty unlucky.  All righty, man.  Wow.  Thank you.  You're welcome.  Bye.  Bye.  Something like that happened to my mom. 
[01:20:00]  She was driving home one night, and, uh...  Your mom hit a body?  No, no.  She's driving.  She saw a body laying in the middle of the road.  So this was somewhere in central Isabel, Long Island.  She pulls off, because it's kind of right across from a little strip mall of stores.  So she pulls off and, uh, gets to a phone, and she's going to call, uh, 9-1-1.  Another car comes by and runs the body over her.  There's just screeches on the brakes. 
[01:20:30]  This guy gets out, just freaked out.  And I was like, no, no, it's already in the road.  Don't worry about it.  It's already laying there.  But I'm like, how do you know the guy wasn't just passed out in the middle of the road?  Maybe he was fine.  You know, hey, Mom, you could have dragged him out on the side of the road.  Thanks a lot.  All, like, 98 pounds of her at the time.  That's true.  He might have been just taking a nap or something on the way home from, uh, the bars.  So, oh, my God.  She watched the car just coming by and going, uh-oh.  Sud-sud.  Hey, Chris, what's up today? 
[01:21:00]  Oh, and hey, what's going on?  Hey, man.  What's up?  Boston loves you.  Oh, thanks.  We love Boston.  Hey, uh, I get, I think I might have some bad news.  Uh-huh.  Have you guys talked to Dice since, uh, yesterday's crash?  Um, no.  Well, I have some inside information.  Uh, somebody I know was getting on the plane.  Yeah, yeah.  Who?  Dice was in front of him, a couple people in front of him.  When he realized it was him, he didn't get on.  There you go.  Uh, he refused to fly a plane with Jews.  There you go.  Wow.  You're good. 
[01:21:30]  So prejudice, uh, you know, saved his life, I guess.  All right.  Uh, thank you, uh, Chris.  Maybe it's not good to go to the phones all the time.  Yeah, sometimes.  We just ought to resist that temptation.  Stalker Patty, what's up?  Hey, how are you?  I think you two have a little lottery story.  Two years ago, I was listening to the show, and you talked about how you were riding down  the Cross Island Expressway, and you almost got hit by a kid.  Now you're going to have to wonder what we almost hit.  Thank God.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank God. 
[01:22:00]  Thank you.  Thank you.  I don't remember anything almost hitting us.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  I remember in Boston, once we were driving to work, and a big snow plow was going past  the overpass.  Now, that was an insane unlucky lottery.  Well, we were fine.  That was nothing.  The wall of snow.  It was just scary as hell.  We're driving, uh, it was snowing like a mother F, and we're driving, uh, to work.  Get local, man.  Get local.  We're, we're driving, I can't even remember what road we were on.  You were coming from Ashland.  I was, uh, coming from Ashland.  We were driving to, uh, Westboro, to the far, far away studio. 
[01:22:30]  Were you coming from the Chestnut Apartments?  Yes, Chestnut Apartments.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  We were, we were driving, uh, and, uh, we were going under the underpass for the Mass  Pike, I believe it was.  Very good.  Back roads, uh, to Westboro?  Yes, yes.  Taking the back roads.  And you gotta go underneath the, uh, the, uh, bridge that's holding up the Mass Pike.  And they have the conga lines of plows that are taking all the snow off of the Mass Pike.  And, uh, this snow deposited on the side of the road of the Mass Pike. 
[01:23:00]  Until they get to the overpass, then the snow flies off the side of the overpass and, uh,  lands on the road, uh, below.  Hopefully nobody will be crossing at that moment.  It was a wall of snow.  Not just a little, like, just a wall of snow.  Picture a full, uh, blade from a snowplow worth of snow falling on your windshield.  Because that's exactly what happened.  We're just driving.  Whistling.  Boom.  Can't see.  Can't see.  All of a sudden, loud bang, totally blind.  Right.  And the wipers are... 
[01:23:30]  Oh, no.  It's heavy wet snow.  You got two feet of heavy snow now on your windshield.  Out of nowhere it came.  We're just driving going, hey, what's going on?  Boom.  Can't see blind.  Driving.  In snow.  A little known fact.  Dave Dickless driving the plow.  Dave Dickless, yes.  Oh, get those son of a bitches.  Stalker Patty, what's up?  Hi, you hung up on me in the middle.  Ass.  Are we going to tape the Michael Jackson special tonight?  Yeah.  Oh, my God. 
[01:24:00]  What's special now?  I don't even know about a Michael Jackson special.  Anthony, it's Michael Jackson's 30th anniversary special.  Is this the one that was, even though he's been in the business 32 years?  Hold the phone.  Is this the one that was taped when he was here live?  Yeah.  I think so, yeah.  Oh, okay.  It's finally on TV.  So we get to see the crap.  It is going to be a complete freak show because you got Whitney Houston.  That's just skin and bones.  She's singing a song.  Uh, Linda Stassi from The Post.  Yeah.  She reviews the special that's on tonight.  It sounds like it's going to be hilarious. 
[01:24:30]  An atrocity that people sitting there praising this criminal.  I guess there's a few montages with Michael Jackson with kids and stuff.  Yeah, with the children.  And Linda Stassi writes,  Please, please, please stop allowing this man to show himself with children.  It makes me want to scream and throw up.  People don't understand I'm a child at heart.  That's what it is.  I missed my childhood because my overbearing father never let me be a child.  So now I have to touch children.  And then it says, 
[01:25:00]  At any rate, the show opens with a number by Whitney Houston.  Her gorgeousness will never die,  but it's being literally eaten away by the fact that she is skin and bones.  She makes Calista Flockhart look fat.  Nice.  It's heartbreaking.  I love it.  Her drug-addicted Bobby Brown,  probably smacking her like Ike Smackedina.  Can only hope.  Yeah.  This is a great tribute.  Let me put on one of my songs.  I'm going to make a change.  More ones in my life. 
[01:25:30]  Ooh, you're cute.  Come here.  Ooh, you're hot.  I like the sound of your voice.  I'm going to make it a rock.  I'm looking at the pedophile in the mirror.  As I turn up the collar.  You're a redhead, gotcha.  That's right.  I'm going to make it a rock.  Oh, it's all good.  You're a kid in the street.  There's not enough to eat.  Who am I to be blind? 
[01:26:00]  Pretending that I'm leaving me.  I don't want to get the eggs, fellas.  You've got a broken bottle of time.  It looks like I'm a rat.  It's in the hole.  Oh, they follow each other on the window.  It looks like you're just supposed to roll it over your wiener.  I don't know where to go.  That's the way no one can't do it.  I'm starting with the man in the mirror.  What was the man in the mirror?  If you, it's probably like six condoms are effective against pregnancy, AIDS, and other 
[01:26:30]  scourges.  Look what I did to you again.  Virgin.  Doggie.  The filthy Sanchez.  Hot car. 
[01:27:00]  Missionary position.  Piledriver.  That's right.  Virgin.  I hope we're not wasting our time with this little picture.  How would you like to mow my lawn?  Huh?  Get on your hands and knees like a dog.  That's it.  Fall around like a dog. 
[01:27:30]  I want your eggs.  Hey, everybody.  We're all going to get laid.  Yeah, baby.  Hey, man.  I'm going to get laid.  Okay.  Coming.  Coming.  Coming.  Coming.  Coming.  Virgin.  You're a little bitch.  That's right.  You're a bitch, and I bet you'd like to suck it, wouldn't you?  Yeah, baby. 
[01:28:00]  Hey, man.  Stay beautiful.  Music or losing.  Red rocket.  Red rocket.  Red rocket.  Red rocket.  Red rocket.  I'm trying to hold my side to a man, man.  Come on.  Wonderful.  Hey.  Okay, terrific.  Okay, horrific.  Okay, horrific.  I'm starting with the man in the mirror. 
[01:28:30]  Is there a man over my shoulder?  Because I can't see a man in the mirror when only I'm looking.  Oh, God.  Woo!  Woo!  And then Linda Stassi goes on to say about this special that's on tonight.  Special.  On CBS.  It's a special.  The cameras keep shooting back to Jackson, sitting in the audience with a chalk white  face.  That's me.  And bright red lipstick next to his pals Elizabeth Taylor and Macaulay Culkin.  When Jackson reunites with his brothers and they do the old Jackson 5 numbers, the show 
[01:29:00]  is perfection.  But you can't help but notice that it looks like this family of black people who somehow  ended up with a brother who's become a kabuki.  Kabuki.  He does look like Kabuki, doesn't he?  Oh, Kabuki.  It reminded me of Steve Martin in The Jerk.  The brothers look so handsome and healthy.  And by contrast, Michael looks even weirder.  And he's not in good voice when singing with the family.  It's vitiligo.  I got the disease that turns you white. 
[01:29:30]  They're all pink on the inside.  That's right.  I got Neverland.  So it looks like it's going to be a fun freak show tonight.  I have a...  It's like an amusement park at my house for children.  And the parents just keep shoveling the children into the auger.  It's all gooey.  That's right.  It sure is, Butters.  Come here.  Get some Michael Jackson ice cream. 
[01:30:00]  It comes in a pump dispenser.  Oh, jeez.  I don't want to get the eggs, fellas.  Why don't we get rid of all those pesky clothes?  I don't want to get the thracks, fellas.  I like what's the look like cleanestness. 
[01:30:30]  They have to be little and hairless.  You ever seen a grown man naked?  You ever met me, but I can never ever know. 
[01:31:00]  You just...  You ever went up.  Yeah, you see every painful detail of my muscular physique.  You ever met me, but I can never ever know.  I'll pick you up in my car.  Old man, wanting to have sex with me.  Pain is it, pain is it, pain is it, pain is it. 
[01:31:30]  Who's that, who's that, who's that, who's that, who's that, who's that, who's that, you ever seen a grown man naked, do you feel like having a background, canises, virgins,

[01:35:00]  guys,  hey, I gotta get a new microphone, we'll be back with the Opie and Anthony show, alright?  All right.  Well, you guys are both stupid.  You're like a black eye for all mankind.  I don't think they're very nice people.  The only way I could actually think they were funny was to be on Heroin.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  You know, I just like want to throw up.  Fields of love.  Anthony Paisano of Mulberry Street in the heart of Little Italy. 
[01:35:30]  Mike ain't up to snuff, is it?  It's busted.  Paisano of Mulberry Street.  We love this place.  It broke real good.  Joey, the owner.  He's great.

Paisano of Mulberry Street.  Paisano of Mulberry Street.  WNEW. 
[01:36:30]  Holy ass.  I'll say it.  Yeah.  We probably just did the funniest thing ever.  Oh, that was a lot of fun for us, at least.  And no one got to hear the funny stuff.  No one.  Well, I'm hearing they were dumping out of something.  Dumping out of one of our sound effects.  Mr. Garrison.  The B-Sex one.  The B-Sex.  B-Sex.  We can't say B-Sex anymore.  B-Sex. 
[01:37:00]  Yeah, yeah.  For some reason, they dump out of that.  Um, because, uh, from what Rick says, he talked to, uh, uh, dump guy there, and, um, it's,  um, uh, new rule.  New rules.  And they come up with these new rules, only they fail to tell us that this new rule is  in effect.  So we play it.  Instead of giving us a list of the new rules.  So we can, uh, maybe work around the new rules.  Yeah.  Instead, they hang us out to dry, so we play this, uh, clip over and over and over again,  thinking it's okay.  We might as well have dead air on the radio. 
[01:37:30]  Right.  How about giving us the new rule?  See, you know why I know it's not a new rule?  Because they didn't tell us.  They're just making it up as they go along.  He's sitting in there going, uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Well, I think I better take that out.  Oh, it's just, uh, retarded.  Don't they understand if they don't tell us the new rules, or tell us, you know that one  clip you guys have been playing for three and a half years?  Well, we've decided this week that you can't play that anymore?  Right.  If you don't tell us that, and we end up playing it on the radio 10 to 20 times, which 
[01:38:00]  I'm estimating we played during that last bit.  Yeah.  That it's a complete waste of air time?  Right.  Do you see that?  There are people in 15 cities going, I don't get it.  This isn't funny.  Yeah.  My friends said they were funny.  I'm checking them out.  That's not funny.  Thank you.  Thank you, down the hall.  Thank you.  So now I have to deal with Pete, because, uh, ooh, there's problems in here now.  Did you hear that last commercial break?  Did you hear some of the commercials cutting in and out? 
[01:38:30]  Happened to be on the same pot on the board as, uh, the same pot that the microphone slammed  into.  Well, I took the $10,000 microphone, and usually I go this way, but this time I was so mad,  I decided.  You went down.  I decided to slam dunk it, so I went, boom, off the board, taking out the whole, two phone  systems.  Yeah.  And knocking this microphone for a loop.  So that was about, I would think, $100,000 worth of equipment that came in contact with 
[01:39:00]  each other in a violent fashion.  I feel like I just broke the vase, and, uh, and Mommy's coming home soon.  Ah.  A little Brady Bunch reference.  Now I'm freaked out, because Pete hates when we mess with the equipment, and now we've got  to deal with him.  Yeah.  Ah.  Well, yeah, we'll have to deal with that at some point.  I don't know.  I just don't feel like bitching about it right now.  Sure, why not take the, why not just take the funniness away from the Opie and Anthony  show?  I'm sure there'll be plenty of listeners left over when the listeners realize that the 
[01:39:30]  show's not funny anymore.  No problem.  When do we, uh, have our little, uh, Ken Stevens meeting?  When is that?  Uh, Thursday.  Is that Thursday?  It's now Thursday.  Good.  Okay.  And now I've got to deal with Pete.  We've got to try to fix this.  What are you doing?  Why did you throw?  You can't throw that stuff.  Look how angry I am.  Oh, what if I do this and this?  Look, I'm very angry.  Here, put something in the, in car five.  We've got to try to fix this on our own.  I need something long.  Okay. 
[01:40:00]  Oh, my God.  I swear to God, I'm going back to being, like, 15.  What did you pray?  When you do something really bad and you, and you got to figure out how to, to fix it  before the parents come home.  Can't you tell by the sound of my voice how angry I am?  All right.  We'll play, uh, we'll play a show sweeper.  All right.  Okay.  Oh, dude.  No.  Thank you.  Listen to that.  Turn it off.  Turn it off.  Oh, my God. 
[01:40:30]  Oh, my beauty.  It's not good for you.  Welcome to your porno egg.  Oh, no.  A stupid program.  Oh, my God.  All right.  Oh, my God.  You've got to help me fix this, man.  Pico's freaking postal.  It's a module.  Pull the module.  I'm putting a new one in.  You think you fixed it?  One, two, three, four, eight.  No, I'm only hearing it in my right ear.  I only hear it in my right ear.  Thank you, girl. 
[01:41:00]  Oh, now it's crackling again.  You, you, you.  Now I hear my left ear low.  It's crackling.  Good for you.  Who else gives you a porno?  Oh, you screwed this up, man.  A stupid program called the porno.  It's getting really bad.  Oh, my God.  Ben just walked that chicken and said, he's got $60,000.  That board is very expensive.  Whoa, what's up, Ben?  Pete, recently how much?  Because Pete gets so upset about all the children. 
[01:41:30]  I'm very upset.  Listen to the anger in my voice.  It costs $60,000.  I don't know what he's thinking.  It'll be his board.  He can put it in his house.  Why does he have to throw things to him and break them?  Give me a screwdriver.  I think I can fix it.  My father's a TV repairman.  He's got an ultimate set of tools.  I can fix it.  Give me, like, a wrench thingy.  Like, what is that?  It's like a wrench and a little screwdriver.  Dan from Hoboken, what's the over-under on how long until Opie gets electrocuted? 
[01:42:00]  Pete should relax, because you know what?  When we were broadcasting in Boston, we were so miserable.  This is a true story.  We threw a 30-pound tombstone through a wall.  Yeah, that was a good one.  Through the wall.  Through the wall.  Not into the wall.  Through the wall.  Maybe we can glue it back together before Dad gets home.  That's what I'm saying.  And these idiots are trying to get Pete on the phone so he can yell. 
[01:42:30]  Don't get Pete on the phone.  Come on.  I get really nervous.  Dude, it'll be funny.  It's like my dad.  Poor Pete, he'll probably die.  Don't it is?  Look, it's like a loose tooth on the board.  Great.  Just yanking out.  Yeah, but I think this is the only problem.  Yeah, but that's kind of an important thing there, because that's where the commercials play.  That's where the commercials go.  And I'm sure they'll never dump out of commercials, right?  Not for the almighty dollar.  The crap they had on network TV the other night with that Saving Private Ryan. 
[01:43:00]  Hey, they showed Saving Private Ryan unedited for content there on TV.  And they dump out of our show and completely destroy a pretty funny bit.  And we can't say the...  That's okay, though.  We have millions of funny bits.  We'll just do the next one for everybody.  Right?  Right, Ant?  Sure.  What's one, or even two, or maybe 18 that they decide to butcher?  Why don't we go into our cute Ronald Reagan bit?  Hey, what did you break, Opie? 
[01:43:30]  I'm so angry, I could break something.  Listen, can't you tell I'm not my normal self?  I'm showing emotion that I am angry right now.  Here's me happy.  Hi, I'm Pete Johnson.  Here's me angry.  Hi, I'm Pete Johnson.  Here's me sad.  Hi, I'm Pete Johnson.  You guys paged him, didn't you?  Here's me slightly melancholy.  Hi, I'm Pete Johnson.  You paged him?  Absolutely.  This could be fun.  I'm going to have to deal with Pete Paterno now. 
[01:44:00]  Great.  Hi.  West Coast Dave, two words, duct tape.  Dude, he got mad about us complaining about the lock to the door of the office the other day.  And that's what?  I have nothing to do with the door problem.  Here's me horny.  Hi, I'm Pete Johnson.  I have a chindle, though.  Did we check the phones?  They're okay, right?  Why don't you put a knife through my heart?  We've got to make sure the phones work.  Michael? 
[01:44:30]  Yeah.  Hey, what's up?  They're working fine.  Who makes the rules, anyway?  No one.  Is it the FCC, or do you just get new dump guys?  The FCC has a set of rules, which we adhere to on a daily basis on this very program.  There is another set of rules, an even more vague set of rules that are put in place and  taken away every day, it seems.  They vary show to show.  They vary hour to hour.  And they are put in place by either Ken and or Jeremy. 
[01:45:00]  And sometimes, I think, just by the dump guy that really isn't quite sure what the hell  to dump out of or what to leave in at any given moment.  That's what we deal with.  I mean, this job is a dump.  I mean, she's paranoid in case things get through.  I mean, is she a fired?  We say the F word, sure, dump out.  We're a little too graphic about things, sure, dump out.  Things we've done on this program for the past three years, all of a sudden now it's  a new rule in place that we can't do it.  How about informing us as to that and why?  And then we could maybe hash out a way to work around it. 
[01:45:30]  I mean, they wing it on their own, and then they let you know after the fact.  What drives me nuts is we're spending ten minutes on a bit, and we're laughing like  little schoolgirls because we're like, oh, my God, this is so freaking funny.  And then we turn around and find out no one heard it because they're dumping out of  the key part of the bit.  Yeah.  Yeah, because I heard that.  We look like complete idiots.  Yeah.  I mean, you know, I mean, that's just ridiculous because I've heard that, you know, you've had  these things before earlier, and now it's on, it's off again, it's on, it's off again.  I don't know if it makes up the rules. 
[01:46:00]  I mean, is the FCC really on Ken Stevens that bad?  Did you hear when we played the garrison clip where he says B-sex?  Yeah.  And then right after that.  No!  Cartman Yellen is the funniest goddamn thing.  Yeah, but you mentioned, too, about Saving Ply Ryan.  This is Channel 7.  Yeah.  And it's just like all the way through.  Yeah, and there's no, you know, there's nothing in place that says that you can say  that under any circumstance.  You shouldn't be able to use that language as far as the FCC goes. 
[01:46:30]  But that, for some reason, they throw them up on it.  I mean, Anthony, can't you go through the alphabet like you usually do?  Oh, no.  We're not allowed to do that anymore, are you?  You can't do that either?  No, we're not allowed to do the alphabet game.  That's ridiculous.  People know exactly what we're talking about.  Yeah.  All right, Michael.  Well, I think they're just a bunch of dumb A's.  Thank you.  And I'd like to see all over their face.  All right, thank you.  That's why we have the beep.  That's right.  So you can tell that mother beep that he can go beep himself. 
[01:47:00]  Oh, they'll take that away from us, too.  Doug, what's up?  What's up?  You know, they've taken about four or five sounds from you guys in the past four or five months.  They've been chipping away.  Funny ones, too.  They're chipping away.  They've been chipping away.  And you know what?  We're having a meeting with Ken Stevens, and we're going to work this out, my friend.  How about if I come into the meeting, too?  So I've got nothing to lose.  They can't fire me.  There you go.  And one more thing.  You know, they need to tell us, you know, what stuff we can't play anymore so we can work around it.  Instead of wasting 10 or 15 minutes of radio thinking that we're doing something funny and no one's hearing it. 
[01:47:30]  Can you say sex B?  Backwards.  Right.  Sex butt.  Sex butt.  No, probably can't.  Who knows?  One more thing.  Pete always says, don't throw the microphone around in the house.  What are you doing?  Later, guys.  All right, bye.  Look how angry you've made, Pete Johnson.  I'm so livid right now.  Hi.  I'm livid, Pete Johnson.  I'm angry.  Uh-oh.  Is that mic working?  Which one?  Say something. 
[01:48:00]  Hello?  Say something.  Don't throw around.  Because I'm freaking.  Okay, that works.  All right, so the only thing that's still busted is this.  That channel on the board you've seemed to have broken by throwing a $10,000 mic into a $60,000  floor.  Well, we take our show pretty seriously, you know?  All right.  Steve came running in with this, a new sweeper for our radio show.  Yeah.  Oh, we can't play it in five, though.  Oh, yeah.  Hold on a minute.  Yeah, don't put it in that one.  Put it in one of the good ones, Opie. 
[01:48:30]  What, six won't work either?  I can't believe what you've done to my board.  Uh, five doesn't work anymore.  Someone will pick up on that for what did we learn?  Five doesn't work anymore.  We at the Opie and Anthony show love our listeners.  Here we go again.  Stupid son of a bitch.  Are you listening to us, you idiot?  Hey, Alex, you douchebag.  All about radio.  Don't listen some more.  Go ahead.  Get everything else wrong.  Shut the f*** up, you dick. 
[01:49:00]  Think about the people who die.  You wouldn't be making fun of it, right?  Well, think of the people that died and wish they were spared so you would die.  But it's a part of it.  You guys want to just make the ratings.  Please, God, if you have to make another plane crash, please make it crash on Alex's head.  You're our kind of people.  Yeah, there you go.  Very good, Steve.  A lot of fun with the caller from yesterday.  That's Steve, right?  Yeah.  The Olympus spot guy?  Where's Steve?  Oh, my God.  I love when Steve, you know, Steve's got a great voice for a lot of the commercials, a lot of the tags. 
[01:49:30]  You know, he's got that good voice.  But then sometimes they make him do a wacky voice, character voice, as they're called.  Got the production voice where it's just you going, did you talk to your doctor about stank?  Did you talk to your doctor about stank?  And then there's the character voices, where you have to now get into some character.  I just like to preface this by saying, I don't write this tripe.  I just read it.  Of course.  No, we don't care about the writing.  But then does it say, do certain characters? 
[01:50:00]  In parentheses at the top, I'll go, game show host character.  Yeah, there are certain clients who do request goofy game show voice, goofy game show sound effects,  and I have absolutely no choice.  Because when I used to have to do production, they would give me all of those.  They would give, you know, give wacky game show host voice or give biker guy voice.  Yeah, yeah.  Some of them have very specific instructions as to what I am supposed to do.  Hold on, I've got to back up for a second.  Joe, go ahead.  What's up?  Hey. 
[01:50:30]  You, is this Opie?  Yeah.  You are nothing but a little girl.  Okay.  Little girl.  Anything else?  You break your stuff up and then you start crying.  Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.  Oh, Pete's going to get me in trouble.  Joe, we're doing it for the show.  Don't you get it?  No, I get it.  Hold on.  Now you're making us have to dump.  Yeah.  No, I understand.  The show is fantastic.  We're doing it for the show because they're effing with the show and we take this very seriously,  believe it or not.  I got you.  I got you.  Just picture, just be in our position for a moment. 
[01:51:00]  We're doing a bit.  We know it's really funny.  We just know.  Sometimes we just know we're in the zone.  We're like, oh, my God, this is so freaking funny.  Okay, and then we turn off the mics and we're like, wow, that was really good.  And then we go to the instant feedback of the phones and people are like, guys, they  dumped out so much that I don't even know what you were doing.  Wouldn't that freak you the F out?  It does.  Actually, I enjoy it when they dump exactly.  I like to hear you cry like a little girl.  I'm fine.  So you're trying to get me worked up.  It ain't happening. 
[01:51:30]  You are worked up.  No, I'm not.  Thanks, man.  All right, guys.  Great show.  You don't get it, obviously.  No, I get it.  I get it.  Fine, we won't take this show seriously, and you watch what a mess this show turns out  to be in another six months, okay?  Actually, I'm glad you guys take the show seriously.  All right.  My drive home from work is fantastic listening to you guys, but you cry a little too much.  Well, someone has to.  Ant cries, too.  He's just not as vocal.  You should see how pissed off he gets. 
[01:52:00]  Yeah, it's fun.  I'll roll tape someday.  You won't believe it.  You know?  I can't wait for Thursday.  We have to fight this battle on a daily basis, because if they had it their way, this show  would really, really suck.  All right.  I can't wait until Thursday, because I get in the meetings then.  What meetings?  Well, we got the Ken Stevens meeting.  Oh, yeah?  And I'll start yelling.  All right.  All right, guys.  Great show.  Thanks, Joe.  Talk to you later.  Bye.  All right.  So getting back to Steve from foundrymusic.com, Anthony. 
[01:52:30]  Yeah.  This is his latest read.  He's the Olympus Gym guy.  Olympus Gym guy.  Olympus Gym game show host, whatever that is.  All right.  Let's hear it.  Hi, and welcome back to What's the Deal?  Hey, it's my guy.  Hi, and welcome back to What's the Deal?  Hey, those are the Bank Bombers, too, for Tuesday.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  I like that.  Pick your category.  I'll pick big, Bob.  Zana's category is big. 
[01:53:00]  Hey, man, you want to have sex tonight?  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Why don't you put that little number on and come to bed?  Wow.  You talking like this at home?  No.  No.  As, as, as.  Because she's sick of it.  My, my, my chick is sick of this.  She's like, all right, you're not at work.  Cut it out.  Name something big in history.  Um, the Big Bang Theory.  In sports.  Oh, the Big Ten.  Around the world.  Big Ben.  And now, for the grand prize, name something big in fitness. 
[01:53:30]  The Big Fitness event at Olympus Gym.  Yeah, that's it.  Name something big that's in my pants.  My big fat.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Don't dump out, because we were talking about his wallet.  My wallet.  And on the other side is my big fat.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Key chain.  Right.  I'm doing my key chain with my big fat. 
[01:54:00]  Whoa.  Whoa.  Hey, Meg, what are you cooking for dinner tonight?  I'll be home in an hour.  Do you talk like this at home?  Uh, you know, yeah, every once in a while I have to practice, so I'll break out the game  show, boys.  And oh, my, honey, I'm, uh, I'm home.  We got chicken.  Oh, great.  That's fantastic.  Wow.  Right.  Don't miss Friday, November 23rd.  It's the biggest fitness event of the year at Olympus Gym.  Now with 12 little kids.  Whoa.  I see what you're doing there. 
[01:54:30]  Smooth.  You're coming out of game show voice to regular voice.  Exactly.  I picked up on that.  Eight in New Jersey, two in New York, and two in Pennsylvania.  Butler, Clifton, Fairfield, Franklin, Jefferson, Newton, Randolph, and Wayne, New Jersey.  In Pennsylvania, there's an Olympus Gym at the Bushkill Fernwood Hotel and in Milford,  plus Middletown and Warwick, New York.  Olympus Gym has it all.  Aerobics, spinning, hammer strength, sauna, pools, personal training, even babysitting.  12 gyms, one price, including unlimited tanning, spinning, and aerobics. 
[01:55:00]  Don't miss the biggest fitness event of the year, Friday, November 23rd at Olympus Gym.  It's going to be a really big show.  What is that?  Yeah, that was my lousy-ass Ed Sullivan impression.  That was because it called for it.  The spot called for it.  It said, they want, when you're dealing with...  Steve's doing voices now, Ethel.  Hi.  Yeah, and the reason I was phasing out of it was because I can't do game show guy voice fast.  So when you've got all that copy to go through, I can't go like this all the time. 
[01:55:30]  Why?  Well, there you go.  That's good.  Hey, can we hear your Tom Brokaw?  No.  That's great.  I like that.  Sure, why not?  Can you do your...  Oh, have them do the commercial tag voice.  You know, the Tonight on Fox.  Oh, that one's easy.  I do that one all the time.  Well, yeah, that's the one you're good at.  Yeah, exactly.  That's like, you know, 50 times a day I've got to spit that crap out.  It's called a tag in the big...  Let's hear it. 
[01:56:00]  Let's hear it.  What?  Tonight at 8 on ABC 7.  That would be a...  Yeah.  Yeah.  Tonight.  Tonight at 8.  I'm a very special Buffy.  You're not far off.  Let's go to Dave.  Dave, you're next on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Hey, Owen.  Hey, what's up?  Hey.  I was wondering if the census took away that game, What's in My Pants?  One of the things that will be brought up in the census meeting on Thursday. 
[01:56:30]  I haven't heard that in a while.  I'm from Boston, and I heard it when you guys first came back.  You know what, though?  I cry like a little girl, so I'm just going to let them take everything away from our show,  and I'm just going to sit back and enjoy.  Why not?  All right.  Thank you.  I can't kick the ass, man.  We'll get it back.  Stop it.  Stop it.  Shut up. 
[01:57:00]  Enough with your crying.  Don't break anything.  I'll put you in the crib.  No, please.  Stop it.  I'm very angry.  Hey, Paula Poundstone put in jail.  What?  Probation violation.  Taken away in handcuffs.  What'd she do now?  Paula Poundstone jailed by a judge who said the comedian relapsed during treatment at the  Drug and Alcohol Rehab Center, where she was sent after pleading no contest to child endangerment 
[01:57:30]  charges.  Remember, she blamed the whole thing on the fact she was drinking and drugging?  Yeah.  Well, she either tested dirty, missed the test or something, and they grabbed her, handcuffed  her, and put her in jail now.  They're not sure how long she's going to have to stay in jail.  She was originally arrested and charged with three counts of committing a lewd act on a girl  under age 14 and endangering two other girls and two boys.  What's the problem? 
[01:58:00]  See, Paula just didn't have enough money.  I can make those problems go away.  I just throw pictures of dead presidents at the parents.  And they say, okay, everything's fine.  You go back with Michael.  Paula Poundstone.  At least she's got her looks.  All right.  Hi, this is Ozzy Osbourne, and I'll see you at the 9th.  I forgot what year I was in there. 
[01:58:30]  Hey, this is Ozzy Osbourne, and I'll see you at...  I was supposed to be going to be crazy.  Should I just say my name?  This is Ozzy Osbourne.  You don't have to.  No, she's going to answer each other.  W-  W-  Oh, f***ing nuts.  That's my...  Get me a f***ing book to read.  Hey, this is Ozzy Osbourne, and you're listening to...  What's that?  Hi, this is Ozzy Osbourne, and I'm listening to...  It'll be O.P. and Anthony on the rock station.  Hi, this is Ozzy Osbourne, and you're listening to O.P. and Anthony. 
[01:59:00]  O.P.  Anthony.  1027.  WNEW.  And we're back with the O.P. and Anthony show.  In the New York area, 877-692-1027.  Anywhere else, give us a call.  866-277.  For WOW.  Wow.  Amy off the instant feedback, Anthony.  How come there is no incentive for chicks to win the Xbox?  Why the F would I want to throw cherries at another chick's A? 
[01:59:30]  Ah.  Do the targets get an Xbox?  I'm a fan, but this freaking sucks, man.  I'm a girl who wants an Xbox.  You guys are being real a-holes about this.  Yeah.  I think the women would have a better chance at winning the Xbox, because they can concentrate  when they throw the cherry darts in.  Yeah.  Girls probably wouldn't get all hung up on what they're throwing the cherry at.  I don't think their hand would be shaken as much, unless they're into women.  Right.  We are doing cherry darts for the Xbox on Thursday on the radio show. 
[02:00:00]  And it's open to ladies.  Sure it is.  We got someone coming from Philly, someone coming from Boston, and we're going to have  lots of people from the New York area coming down.  Basically, we have this lady from Privileged Gentleman's Club coming in.  We're going to put a dartboard on her naked body, and whoever gets closest to the bullseye  will win the Xbox.  Hence, cherry darts for the Xbox contest.  And we're going to be using Fluffernutter, because that sticks better than the whipped cream. 
[02:00:30]  That marshmallow fluff stuffs like glue.  Eric, what's going on?  Eric.  Hey, how you doing?  All right, what's up, bro?  Hey, they just said on Channel 2, unconfirmed, that they found feathers in one of the engines  of the plane.  Feathers?  How would they find that?  They just said it.  I don't know.  I don't believe the news.  I don't believe the news.  I'm still going with the flock of seagulls theory.  Oh, you are?  Oh, yeah.  Well, then the feathers would help me out, right?  Help you out. 
[02:01:00]  It wouldn't help your Back to the Future theory.  No, no.  I think my Back to the Future theory has been shot.  I don't know.  It was a good theory at first.  I just don't know how birds going into one engine can make both engines fall off and  the tail fall off.  I don't know.  All right, you guys suck.  Thank you, Eric.  Tell me about it.  Tell me about it.  Tell me about it.  Ahmed.  Abdul. 
[02:01:30]  Tell me about it.  It is time to make the shihan.  Wait, wait.  What is that noise?  I think it's the Americans.  Who can take some towels?  Who can take some towels?  Wrap them around their heads.  Wrap them around their heads.  This is the worst song ever, by the way.  Harborsome gorillas thumb their noses at the feds.  The Taliban.  Oh, I get it.  The Taliban.  Oh, the Taliban can.  The Taliban.  Cow heads.  The Taliban can. 
[02:02:00]  Because they like to help in Lod and make the world go boom.  Sand monkey.  Who can grab Osama?  Who can grab Osama?  Catch him in a sting.  Catch him in a sting.  Yeah, I get that.  Slap him in to handcuffs.  Beat his ass like Rodney King.  The Taliban.  The Taliban.  The Taliban.  The Taliban can.  The Taliban can.  Cracklin' Rosie.  The Taliban can.  The Taliban can.  Because they like to help in Lod and make the world go boom. 
[02:02:30]  The towel heads.  The world go boom.  The Taliban hates the United States.  Because they think we're not religious.  Sand monkey.  And they're jealous of our ridges.  We may have to blow their bridges.  What?  This is awful.  Okay, brother.  When we're done with Kabul.  When we're done with Kabul.  Iran has been defiled.  Iran has been defiled.  What?  Kadapi, Asaridi, Amin, and his crocodile. 
[02:03:00]  They're all gonna pay.  They're all gonna pay.  Kadapi hasn't done anything in years.  They're all gonna pay.  It just rhymes in the song.  Yeah, this is an awful song.  Was this big chocolate?  I love playing that because it pisses so many people off.  It's so bad.  It's just an awful song.  It's a damn and great big spanking.  Whoa.  Now his presidential ranking definitely will stop tanking. 
[02:03:30]  Yeah, and now...  Pull it off.  I'm gonna break the point.  Tomorrow.  We're gonna turn it off.  Is that when it will be?  Is that when it will be?  Who can turn it off?  Just from looking up to see the Taliban.  Oh, the Taliban can.  Turn it off.  The Taliban can because they like to help Bin Laden make the world go boom.  It's a feel-good song, Adam.  Make the world go... 
[02:04:00]  Baggy.  Well, the latest on the Taliban, as he says.  The Taliban.  Oh, nice segue.  I like it.  Yeah.  Good radio segue.  Thank you.  They've been chased out of the capital of Afghanistan, Kabul.  Yeah.  Yeah, they left after all of their, we will fight to the death and we will never leave  and you suck, we rule.  Did they say that?  You suck, we rule at some point.  Yeah.  I think that was in the translation.  Yeah. 
[02:04:30]  Well, under the cover of darkness last night, they hustled on out of there with their weapons  and the back of their little Toyotas and they left Kabul, which was then occupied by the  Northern Alliance kooks.  Now, the Northern Alliance kooks are the ones that have shaved.  Was that the shaved ones?  Yeah, I think it's, yeah, the wars between the beards and the clean shaven.  I never even noticed that.  Oh, yeah.  Look at the footage on TV.  Everyone clean shaven, not from the Taliban. 
[02:05:00]  All right.  I'll have to notice that next time.  I just know that I'm...  Unless they're trying to trick the Northern Alliance and they're shaving their beards  to fit in.  Maybe.  Who knows?  You know, with this whole...  Sand monkeys!  This whole work, that would almost make sense.  All right.  Because now the Northern Alliance has moved in there.  And now we're hearing the Northern Alliance soldiers celebrating their taking of Kabul  with some good old-fashioned drag-out-of-your-bed executions. 
[02:05:30]  Meet the new boss, same as the old boss.  What are you saying?  Well, it seems that the Northern Alliance moved in, found some of these Taliban guys that  were just trying to, I guess, stay and fit in, dragging them from their hovels that they  were staying in and their holes and their foxholes and everything else, and torturing and  murdering them.  But these are the good people to murder.  You see what I mean? 
[02:06:00]  See, before it was the towel-head people killing other towel-headed people.  Now it's towel-headed people killing other towel-headed people.  But it's good.  But some of these Taliban wanted to kind of fit in with the new regime?  Yeah, they wanted to...  They didn't want to leave.  It wasn't like they were defecting, because they're taking the people that are defecting.  They just wanted to be done with the whole thing.  But it's like, all right, I'm like, okay, we tried that Taliban thing.  It didn't work out.  So I'm going to just try to fit in with the new regime.  Yeah.  Some of the old soldiers.  So they're killing them. 
[02:06:30]  We have some of our troops there with the Northern Alliance in Kabul.  And now it seems that the Northern Alliance, they've taken over about 40% of Afghanistan.  And the Taliban on the run saw some great footage on the news today.  The daily Pentagon briefing where they showed some of the convoy leaving Kabul.  And some films reminiscent of the Highway of Death in Iraq.  Moving vehicles being struck by our bombs. 
[02:07:00]  Just wonderful to watch.  Because you know there's just some, oh, I've gotten away, ha ha, boom.  And you just watch the vehicle explode.  It's wonderful.  I love my tax dollars blowing up moving vehicles.  But then, watching the press conference, and we hear this reporter.  And he asked the dumbest hooking question I think I've ever heard since this whole thing started.  Yeah, well, we got that question here. 
[02:07:30]  Could you explain the justification for attacking military troops in retreat?  They have been obviously offered an opportunity to surrender.  And in the history of warfare, when things are not going well for an organization, that is often an opportune time to make progress. 
[02:08:00]  And I think that it is an important time.  Because they are not attacking.  They are retreating.  And they are not surrendering.  They are not throwing down their weapons.  They are moving their vehicles.  And it is a perfectly legitimate and attractive target.  And we intend to take every opportunity to do that.  Bravo!  You know, war is not supposed to be politically correct.  They are retreating to regroup, you idiot.  Exactly!  You know, that guy that asked that question. 
[02:08:30]  They are retreating to that other there city there.  And that stronghold.  Thank you.  The stronghold.  They are going to regroup and try to figure it out there.  Right.  So, of course, you take the opportunity to take out more troops.  Justification of bombing of troops that are retreating.  It's called pulling back.  You pull back because you're getting your ass kicked.  And the trick is to kill them as they retreat so that they cannot stop, regroup, and then fight you again. 
[02:09:00]  It's what's done in a war.  It's called killing your enemy.  Do you have to explain it to these press asses?  Thank God the media wasn't like this in World War II, or we'd be goose-stepping our way to work on a daily basis.  Yes.  Speaking German or Japanese.  Un-effing believable that he even had to justify that question.  How do you justify?  Where's the justification in bombing? 
[02:09:30]  Why are they even taking questions from the press?  It's entertaining.  It's true.  They probably, you know, they went back to the Pentagon and went, did you see that a-hole?  Ask me that stupid-ass question.  It's like a football game.  And just because you're leading.  Can you justify scoring yet another touchdown when you're winning the game in the first place?  How do you justify taking that ball across the goal when you're already winning?  No. 
[02:10:00]  How did Muhammad Ali...  You know what?  I'm coming back.  How did Muhammad Ali justify the beating of Chuck Webner when he knew that he was retreating?  How can you keep punching your opponent when he's backing up?  It's obvious that he's going to lose.  Remember Parcells?  Yeah, Parcells used to handle questions like this.  Great.  Did you go in there, Coach, expecting to win today's game?  What kind of a stupid question?  Of course, we're expecting to win.  What do you think?  We go in there expecting to lose?  Get out of here, you pain-in-the-ass idiot.  We need him for the press conferences. 
[02:10:30]  What's the justification in bombing troops that are retreating?  Easy targets?  I don't know.  They're not shooting at you?  We're going for the kill?  The press.  They should bomb the briefing room.  They should get them all in there.  Where the hell is Ashcroft today?  What's that sound?  And then at the next briefing, it could show, here's the press room.  Watch as this bomb hits the press briefing room, taking out a bunch of morons that ask stupid questions. 
[02:11:00]  The dumbest goddamn question I've heard yet.  Check out this.  Read that one on the air.  From the W-A-F.  I got answered Dan from Hoboken.  Is that code?  Yeah.  Let me see what you were answering to.  I'll let everyone in. 
[02:11:30]  Double cough.  Dan from Hoboken is hilarious.  He goes, cough once if management took away Homer Tuesday, too.  Cough twice if the bit just began to suck.  Hey, wait.  I want to play this.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Yeah.  What is that?  We should read that because then the listeners could attack.  Yeah.  From the AF website under Rocco and Maddie.  You know, the guys in Massachusetts. 
[02:12:00]  I want to say Boston.  They're the staticky station in Boston.  But in Massachusetts, they have the three to seven shift at the station we used to work at.  Rocco and Maddie.  Let's see.  They have a phone line now?  Yeah.  Hey, the blow?  What?  What is this?  Are they going to dump out of that?  Hey, probably.  Let me see.  Let me see.  We can't even read this without them. 
[02:12:30]  Hey, blow.  It's the hey, blow hotline.  All right.  No.  Hey, blow me, it says.  Oh, that never works.  They dump.  Let's see.  Let's see.  Let's get the response back and then we'll continue.  They have castrated. 
[02:13:00]  They have castrated this program.  We're in?  Because it has no real sexual connotations to it.  Look at someone using their brain finally today.  Right.  Good one.  It's an expression.  It's used as an expression.  We know that many of you listen to...  What is this from?  Oh, it's from their website?  Yeah.  Oh.  Hey, we know many of you listen to Rocco and Maddie and Way Home.  We also know that many of you have had a bad day where someone pissed you off. 
[02:13:30]  So we have a way to let off some steam on your ride home.  There's now a blow me hotline.  Just call.  And they got the number.  You can call anytime, day or night.  Leave a brief message and tell us why you want to send out a blow me dedication.  We play it every day at 545.  540.  That's our...  Excuse me.  It's the FU line.  It's the FU line, you idiot.  They have just started doing the FU line. 
[02:14:00]  I'm glad that they have our website that they could go to and pilfer.  Why don't you give out the phone number?  Well, if you want to...  Because someone's going to have to listen to all these messages and it's not going to be pretty.  If you want to leave...  It's on their website.  So we're just doing them a little favor, I guess.  It's 617-779-5499.  For the blow me hotline.  I only want guys to call.  Yeah.  Hey, Dave, this is a great idea. 
[02:14:30]  If you're pissed off, it sounds familiar.  Where did I hear this before?  617-779-5499.  And you can find that number on their website.  It's probably busy right now, I would think.  I would think that's really, really busy.  Hey!  Come on.  If you're pissed off and want to let off some steam, how long have we had the FU line?  Like three years.  This is ridiculous. 
[02:15:00]  Oh, boy.  There you go.  All right.  Wait, wait, wait.  What?  Just like the assault on the media.  Yeah, the assault on the media.  Where'd that come from?  Foundry is their show prep.  Yeah.  Yeah, foundrymusic.com is a lot of people's show prep.  Let me go to Prep Burger.  F-O-U-N-D-R-Y Music.  Foundry Burger.  Hey, screw it.  Just give me a burger.  I'm hungry.  I hope people are taking notice. 
[02:15:30]  That's all.  Here's your photo.  Please.  Hey, this is the blow-me hotline.  Hey, my name's John.  John, I got a big blow-me for my boss, Dick Pete.  I hate this guy.  I'm his puppet.  I'm his bitch.  I can't do anything I want to do because he won't allow me.  I can't even talk about the jocks that are kicking my ass. 
[02:16:00]  And this guy, Dave Dick, John, what did I call him, Matty?  Pete.  Pete is really pissing me off.  Hey, Rocco and Matty, you rule.  Oh, there you have it.  Sounds a little familiar.  Yeah.  Alex, what's going on?  What's going on?  So they finally shutting you up, huh? 
[02:16:30]  What?  They finally shutting you up.  They don't let you say any more bad words today, huh?  Remember this guy?  Oh, you're the guy from yesterday?  I'm the guy from yesterday.  See, he loves the show.  He likes now that he's a character.  No, you know what?  My 14-year-old nephew was listening to it.  Now it just doesn't work because now you called back.  Oh, so you want me to know that?  Now you're going to be like the angry guy, Alex.  You want to be a character on the Opie and Anthony show?  Opie, let me ask you a question.  You want to be the angry guy now that you're in one of the promos?  I know you're up for a living, but just let me ask you a question. 
[02:17:00]  Hey, could I be angry, Alex?  I want to be on the show.  I want to be on the show.  I love the show.  I know, but I'll say that I hate you guys, but I call up and I'll tell all my friends  that I'm angry Alex on the Opie and Anthony show.  It's not good now.  It doesn't work.  You should have left it when you were ahead.  I just wanted to ask you a question.  It was great.  You called up.  You were the a-hole yesterday, and now you're calling it a game.  Oh, you want to be a character like Stalker Patty and Retarded Laverne and Shirley?  You want to be the Alex guy on the show?  What's up, Alex? 
[02:17:30]  Can I ask you a question?  Yeah, go ahead.  When you were born, did your mom wanted a dog or a pony?  Whoa!  What kind of name is Opie?  You know how embarrassing that is?  What kind of name is Opie?  I've talked about my stupid name.  Did you work on your material overnight, Alex?  Hey, I got through yesterday.  I'm going to call him up tomorrow, and I'll have some material written out.  Opie, Opie, was this dog?  No, you hung up on me yesterday.  Alex.  Yo.  I've talked about my stupid name.  I hate my name.  I've been called... 
[02:18:00]  Are you sure that's your real name?  No, it's not.  Everyone knows my real name's Greg.  I thought you were an idiot.  Well, I don't listen to your show.  Yeah, yeah, sure.  Because I know people get really hard to be brought up with that name.  I've had this name since I was 12.  I'm not happy about it, but now, you know, I've been on the radio a long time with this name.  Oh, so you dump on people because they dump on you when you would let them.  It's easier than growing up with that accent, Alex.  Well, how many languages do you speak?  Huh?  How many languages do you speak?  I speak two.  English?  I just speak one very well.  I speak two very well, too.  Oh, sure. 
[02:18:30]  It sounds...  Very well.  Very well.  But at least I speak two.  Hey, Alex, keep listening.  All righty.  Keep listening, man.  Hey, you got me with that Opie thing, though.  Wow.  That was good.  The dog thing was great.  Yeah, like I'm sitting here thinking Opie's like the coolest name ever.  Tell your friends you made it through again.  Why don't you change it?  Huh?  Why don't you change it?  Tell your friends you made it through again.  I just explained why.  Okay.  All right.  Are you done?  Yeah, I'm done.  All right.  Well, hey, you got me.  All righty.  Yeah, one for you.  Bye.  Hey, hey, did you hear me?  Did you hear me again?  I was on the show again. 
[02:19:00]  Hey, hey, is this Pedro?  Well, at least he's signing you up.  Hey, did you hear me?  Did you hear me on the show again?  Soon you don't want to have a job.  It was...  I was on the...  Yesterday, and they made fun of me.  They made a promo.  And then I was on today, and I called Opie.  I said that his name is stupid, and that the parents want the dog.  And then I went down and left Little Ricky with Mrs. Trumbull, and me and Fred went to the club.  At least my name is not Opie.  It was wonderful. 
[02:19:30]  And then Pac put his finger in the peanut butter, and then I got married to a guy.  He's cute.  You know, we're in love, but I cannot live in this environment.  And then I went and cut some...  I saw you were leaving.  Cut the heads off of some parking meters.  No, Alex, you were supposed to hang up, but you loved the limelight.  Did you hear me?  Did you hear me, my friends?  There he goes.  He finally hung up.  You know, it is better to look good than to feel good.  Wow.  Yeah, I had to go old school on that one.  Hey, Frank, what's going on? 
[02:20:00]  Hey, guys, Boston fan, check it in.  Oh, cool.  Yeah, just tried giving your blow-me-line a call, and they must have already caught wind of it.  It just rang until the operator picked up and said, if you want to make a call, you know.  Well, you guys, you know, the One Army, you've got a new mission.  Keep at it, guys.  Keep at it, not just today.  Just make it a complete nightmare for them to do that bit.  It's locked into memory, and redial is in process.  Thank you, Frank.  I appreciate it.  Hey, guys, you suck.  All right.  I'm going to call the blow-me-line. 
[02:20:30]  I'm pissed off at O.P. and Anthony.  They wrecked my blow-me-line.  Hey, this is Frank.  You know, it's cute, we're getting married, me and Dave.  What's the phony bit this week?  Is it the marriage or the girlfriend leaving?  I don't know.  Maybe he'll give away another toy Yoda.  Friday, November 16th, from 9 to 11, Club H2O, Revere Beach, 
[02:21:00]  join Rocco as he hosts Budweiser Battle of the Bands at Club H2O.  Well, there you go.  Join him.  Friday, November 16th.  We'll give him a plug.  Yeah.  We want all of the O.P.  You know, we ought to share our audience, O.P.  We're being very, very selfish in Boston, taking all of Rocco's audience.  So we'll give some back.  So any of the O.N.A.

[02:22:00]  Why don't you just throw hamburgers at the stage?  He might be hungry.  I would suggest bring him food and give it to him in an orderly fashion.  Oh, look, Steve's being such a nice little guy there.  He's going to put all the info up on Foundry.  Okay.  If you want all the info to Rocco's appearance, because we want to share our audience now with Rocco.  Sure.  Why not?  We just handed this.  It'll be up in a few moments.  So if you want to know where it is and the time and everything, go to foundrymusic.com,  and you can get that info.

And I don't know, if you can't get too close to him, you know, pass it on.  Food fights are nice.  Pass it over to him.  Somehow get it to him, because we just want to make sure he's well-fed.  And please make sure you bring some camcorders and maybe a tape recorder. 
[02:23:00]  Whatever you want.  Super soaker.  And show the love.  Show the love that we know Opie and Anthony fans can show for other radio personalities.  Yes, Jack.  What's up?  Hey, what's going on?  How you guys doing, man?  I got through those schmucks up in Boston, man.  I encourage everyone to go through and have a good time with them, man.  Oh, you're going through?  Oh, it was awesome, man.  I made that guy, how you just berated that angry Alex Flake.  Yeah.  That was like a walk in the park.  And that's going to get to Rocco and what's-his-name up there. 
[02:23:30]  But anyway, have fun, fellas.  Keep it going.  All right, Jack.  Thank you.  Bye.  Yeah, a lot of people leaving some nice messages.  Hey, it's their new bid.  That's good.  Oh, I wish I was going to be in Revere.  Roger, what's up?  Yeah, what's up, guys?  I want to know how to get into the Cherry Dart game.  Ah, Cherry Darts for the Xbox.  Yeah.  Doing it Thursday on the Opie and Anthony show.  What?  Why do you want to be a contestant?  Because I need that Xbox.  I need it.  Why do you need the Xbox, Roger?  Because I am an absolute game freak, and I need to have this system, and it's too expensive. 
[02:24:00]  Are you a student?  Yeah.  Listen to them breathing heavy and everything.  What college do you go to?  Suffolk Community.  Oof.  You need it.  Wow.  Suffolk Community.  That's the 13th grade.  Roger, Roger, give me the turning point, that pivotal moment where it all went wrong for you.  I'm sure there was a time when you were growing up, Mom and Dad thought you might be going to Harvard.  Oh, you better believe it.  Well, in fifth grade, I was told to do good in school, and since then, I've been doing absolutely nothing. 
[02:24:30]  Or maybe Temple University.  Yeah.  Maybe BU, Anthony.  Now I could go to college.  Slow down.  Maybe RIT.  Yeah.  In Rochester.  What happened?  What happened, Roger?  Where did it go wrong?  I think from the beginning.  Doing absolutely nothing.  Did you do drugs in high school?  No, that's one thing I didn't do, actually.  You just sucked?  Yeah, basically.  I need too much video games, man.  I need more.  So why are you going to Suffolk Community College?  Actually, truthfully, for baseball.  That's the reason I'm there right now, and I have to transfer out. 
[02:25:00]  Baseball?  Do they have a team?  I'll go one better.  I'm majoring in broadcasting.  You're a majoring in broadcasting at Suffolk Community College?  Yes, I am, for now.  Oh, God, you need the Xbox.  Yes, I do.  Opie, you went to broadcasting school.  Now, did you even look at Suffolk Community College?  No, no, no.  Did you see what they had to offer to somebody that wanted to be a broadcaster?  I looked at Boston University.  Okay.  Syracuse. 
[02:25:30]  Yeah.  Couldn't afford it, so then I started looking into state schools.  Geneseo had a fine communications program.  What was Suffolk Community lacking that made you not even consider Suffolk Community?  I don't even think they have a radio station.  Is it just like a walkie-talkie in a classroom?  Roger, do they have a radio station there?  No.  You're majoring in broadcasting at a place that doesn't have a radio station.  And, you know, it really pissed me off when I was in college because I went to Geneseo for communications.  I really wanted to do radio or TV or both or whatever. 
[02:26:00]  I was set on this, okay?  Everyone that felt that they're majors would join the communication department.  Oh, it was like a way out.  Right.  Because it is the easiest degree to get, and you're getting it at Suffolk Community College.  Oh, my God.  Suffolk Community College.  It's the 13th grade.  The 13th grade.  Because anyone in the community can go.  Basically.  You know, Roger, you sold us, man. 
[02:26:30]  You're pretty pathetic.  Thanks.  You're not lying to us, right?  Not at all.  And what position do you play in baseball?  I'm a pitcher.  Pitcher?  Yes.  Any scouts looking you over?  Well, uh...  Have any scouts gone to Suffolk Community College to check you out?  Yeah, Stony Brook came to look at me.  Stony Brook came to look at me.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Keep heading east.  You might make it to Oxford.  How old are you?  18.  18.  Dude, get out now, man. 
[02:27:00]  What are you doing?  Your parents making you go?  No.  Well, like I said, I'm just there for once.  I'm trying to get out into September, and then I'm looking for a better school.  And I actually spoke to Rick about getting an internship there for the major next term.  Wow.  You sound pretty qualified to work on this show.  Yeah, right?  You know what?  I'm going to tell you what my mom always told me.  Get a trade to fall back on.  Learn a trade.  Oh, if I had to hear that one more goddamn time.  Learn a trade.  You could always fall back on it. 
[02:27:30]  You know, Apex Tech gives you that free set of tools, my friend.  Oh, thanks.  You could learn car mechanics, air conditioning and heating, whatever you need.  Or can you draw Winky?  No.  Nah.  Not that good.  That was hard.  And you can't trace it and send it in.  They know.  How do they know?  It's too good.  Matches up too perfectly.  Okay.  Roger, you're in for the Cherry Darts for the Xbox contest that we'll be holding Thursday, okay?  All right.  Hold on the line for some info.  All right.  I'm sure you could blow off classes for a day. 
[02:28:00]  Oh, you better believe it.  What a sad story.  What class will you be missing on Thursday?  Actually, the only class I'll be missing is health.  That's the only class I have at that time.  Health?  Yeah.  It's because I needed to require it.  If you haven't figured out health after high school.  Yeah, well, I'm still in it.  In Suffolk community, that's pre-med.  There you go.  What do they teach you in health class?  What do they teach you in a community college?  Well, they're teaching us how Suffolk and Nassau has the highest rates of teenage, what's that called? 
[02:28:30]  STDs.  STDs.  There you go.  Girls don't have wee-wee.  That's what they teach you there.  God, you got a sad story.  All right.  You're coming in to try to win that Xbox.  All right.  Thanks.  Hold on the line, Roger.  Communications class in Suffolk community.  Make sure the string is pulled very tightly and you have two Campbell's soup cans.  Now, talk into one when putting your ear against the other.  Hey, man, I'm sure there's a lot of good reasons to go to Suffolk Community College.  Yeah.  But one of them is not to try to get into broadcasting. 
[02:29:00]  Yeah.  Or to play baseball.  Or to play baseball, right.  Suffolk Community College.  Well, there you go.  Do they even have a TV commercial out along that?  Yeah, they do.  All right.  We have to take a break and we'll play, what did we learn on the O.P. and Anthony Show?  Education.  You guys have a superior rating.  It's beyond belief right now.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  Thank you.  All right.  What the hell? 
[02:29:30]  We're back with the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Time to play, what did we learn on the O.P. and Anthony Show today?  Probably more than if you went to Suffolk Community College.  I would think.  Pluto, what's up?  Hey, I learned I could be a brain surgeon in Suffolk County.  Suffolk Community.  Okay.  Terrific.  Yeah.  Playing his own sound effects, too.  Health class at Suffolk Community.  Well, that's pre-med, Anthony.  Ryan.  What's up?  What's up, guys?  I learned Michael Jackson looks like Kabuki.  Yes.  O.P. is terrified of Pete Johnson. 
[02:30:00]  Yes.  Rocco's blow me line will be busy.  Yes.  And somewhere in Suffolk Community College, there's a picture of being gay fag box.  Good job, Ryan.  Anthony, what did you learn, man?  What's up?  Carmen Yelly, always funny.  Yep.  Five still doesn't work.  Yep.  Health that...  Oh, did you notice...  Hold on.  Did you notice in New York five still doesn't work?  Yeah, yes, yes, yes.  That was just for you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  All right.  Uh, what else?  Health is like pre-med at Suffolk Community College.  Very good. 
[02:30:30]  Thank you.  Peace.  All right.  Bye.  Dan from Hobart, I can learn that Q number five won the unlucky lottery today.  Yeah.  That's number five pot on the board won the unlucky lottery when a $10,000 microphone plummeted into it.  Remember, we're all going to say we don't know what happened.  I heard everything.  Sheep Lover.  What did...  Sheep Lover learned you're poor if you live by the mall.  Yes.  In a duplex.  Do we have to get these guys in?  Yeah. 
[02:31:00]  All right.  These guys helped us out on Long Island when...  They don't call Raw's war anymore.  Raw.  The WWE.  Just Raw.  Live event at the Coliseum.  These were the guys in the front row.  Enough war.  With the Norton 316.  Yeah, and the Bat Stinks.  The Opie and Anthony.  Opie what?  Something about Stinky.  And unfortunately, they came in second place.  So they will not be going to the Survivor Series in North Carolina, which is on pay-per-view,  I believe, this Sunday from the WWF.  But we're going to give them some other things, like I think a Samsung DVD player and other 
[02:31:30]  crap.  Right?  We gave them something else, too.  You are ripped.  Ass-beating in foosball during the commercial.  I'm really ripped.  Oh, really?  Oh, yeah.  It was a turkey shoot.  It was a turkey shoot.  What does your shirt say?  Please don't feed...  The animals.  I have no idea what it says.  Right.  Dude, you guys are ripped.  No.  You guys are swinging.  We brought a case for you guys.  We've got two beers left. 
[02:32:00]  We had them drinking.  You're drinking some Sam.  Yeah.  There you go.  Sam Oktoberfest.  Nice.  Two beers left, one for you, one for you.  Well, gee, thanks.  That's okay.  We won't drink it all in one place.  So, do they hook you up with stuff for coming in second place?  Yeah.  Yeah, we got a whole bunch of stuff over there, but we'd rather have a shot at the Cherry  Dolls to tell you the truth.  Hmm.  I like the picture.  We'd rather give it all up just for two shots at the Cherry Dolls.  Oh!  You want to play Let's Make a Deal?  What about three?  What about three?  We don't want anything.  All right, what are you giving up to get a shot at the Xbox? 
[02:32:30]  I don't know.  What do you have over there?  DVD player?  The Samsung DVD player.  Wow.  A bunch of Wow shirts.  A bunch of Wow shirts.  Wow.  Okay.  What is that?  Some DVDs?  Some CDs.  Yeah.  Green Day CDs.  Green Day CDs.  Very good.  And you'll give all that up.  And some computer games.  Computer games.  Some computer games.  Computer games.  Some confusion games.  That's cool.  And you'll give up all that stuff for your chance to win an Xbox when we play Cherry Darts for 
[02:33:00]  the Xbox on Thursday.  Yeah, just for a Cherry Dolls shot.  Wow.  What do you think, Ian?  I think we ought to do whatever they want like that.  Sure.  Why not?  Plus, we set it off.  I mean, look at it.  Boston.  Monday night.  Oh, he just spilt his beer on the coming.  Oh, Pete is going to.  Don't let it.  Hey, what happened?  That's not 50,000.  All right.  At this point, I will confess.  I wrecked pot five, but that is the only thing I wrecked today.  I fixed everything else.  What's that, 1,000? 
[02:33:30]  Come on.  I spilt the beer.  Clean up that beer.  Can I take this home with me?  Yeah.  What are you taking home?  That's a half-hour Don and Mike bit right there.  What happened?  That's funny, man.  You can't ruin my studio.  Spilling beer.  Very good.  So, yeah, okay.  I'd be into that.  Only one of you guys could throw the Cherry Hearts now.  Uh-oh.  Wait a minute.  Can we all come down at least?  Yeah, yeah.  You all could come down.  And the two guys could cheer on the third guy.  How's that?  All right.  That's a good deal. 
[02:34:00]  I think that's a good deal.  I think that's a good deal.  By the way, you see all the wow signs in Boston last night?  Yeah.  I saw the wow signs.  That was pretty good.  I saw the last minute effort signs in Jersey to beat us out.  The last minute effort signs.  You were pretty pissed, but that guy had the hugest wow.  It was the biggest wow.  He was pretty creative with wow.  You can't deny.  You guys came up with it.  I know, but you can't deny how big that wow was.  He's being sarcastic.  That's great.  Yeah, you know something?  We were a little pissed off that he wasn't adding a few more things on there. 
[02:34:30]  But the size was ridiculous.  Please, the way you work it, Ope.  But you didn't have the variety that we had.  I personally liked a lot of variety.  It was your size.  The girl always told me size didn't matter.  Don't understand.  Now he's done every wrong thing you could possibly do in his studio.  He has spilled beer on the $20,000 equipment.  Why don't you just go out and crunch in the no-crunching bathroom while you're at it?  Who crunched in there?  No one.  He's done everything else wrong.  Not yet.  I was waiting on my way out.  And now we can't play What Do We Learn? 
[02:35:00]  Because we're stuck with these guys in the studio.  We're out of time already.  Don't.  Look at the time.  You guys should have won.  I'm telling you.  I mean, the signs were great.  Blame it on the judges.  And then the Fleet Center was rocking because you guys have started up again with the live  signs on the sign on my TV.  The guy had the wow board from one of the buses.  One of the bus wow boards.  Had the big wow logo on there.  Ope and Anthony BCN.  So that was cool.  That worked.  I liked that.  As long as you're a thief, I guess you get what you want.  Thief? 
[02:35:30]  Well, you know, yeah.  Columbus started off, but who cares about all the other scourgeers?  Creativity doesn't count for anything right now.  That's a lesson to you.  These guys are a little bitter, but that's understandable.  And a little wet.  We didn't even go out there expecting to win anything.  That's okay.  Let them go on the planes.  Just out of being a fan of the show, that's all another thing.  Did anybody hit the inappropriate bell on that one?  Thank you.  Thank you.  These guys rock.  They really rock. 
[02:36:00]  All right.  So we'll take back the DVD player, the computer games, the CDs, and we'll let you have the  wow shirts.  Oh, thank you.  And then you guys come back Thursday and you guys decide who has the best aim for the  cherry dart competition.  I think I do, actually.  Depends on who drinks more beers than anything.  Well, you guys have to figure that out all.  Yeah, you better pick the best guy.  You know, by Thursday?  Yeah, someone that can really get a good sense of aim.  Maybe someone that shoots darts.  Anyone shoot darts at all?  Yeah.  Yeah?  From time to time.  What's your game? 
[02:36:30]  What's your game?  What's your game?  Cricket?  301?  What do you play?  Cricket, mostly.  I like the cricket myself.  You don't even know what cricket is, do you?  Double in, double out.  That's a man's game.  All right, guys.  All right.  We'll see you Thursday then, all right?  All right.  Yeah.  Thanks for drinking all the beer that you brought for us.  And spilling a little bit on the headphones and part of the console and cursing.  Thank you.  Thank you for having us, too.  You know, I can respect that and I appreciate that.  I like these guys.  We can hang with you guys.  You're all right.  All right.  There they go. 
[02:37:00]  Gents, thanks, man.  Well, we can't play what we learned today.  No, look at the time.  So we'll be back tomorrow for Whip Him Out Wednesday, Anthony.  All right.  Very important day on the Opie and Anthony show.  Hey.  Throw them out Thursday.  No, someone already decided to do that.  I know.  Please.  That's those two guys in Detroit.  Sad.  Freaking idiots.  All right.  Tomorrow at three, right?  Tomorrow at three. 
[02:37:30]  The Opie and Anthony show.  It's usually just a bunch of guys sweating and burping and farting.  Hail for the kings of the radio. </pre>
