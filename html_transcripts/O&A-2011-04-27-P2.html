<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The After Opie and Anthony Live broadcast, hosted by Sam Roberts, began with a chaotic scene. The studio was a mess following the main show, where comedians Bob Kelly, Joe DeRosa, and Bill Burr had engaged in a food fight with Anthony Cumia during a live read, resulting in a water-soaked keyboard, water stains on the walls and TV, and general debris scattered throughout.  Cara DiGuardi, a scheduled guest, was unable to appear due to scheduling conflicts.

The broadcast then transitioned into a discussion of the Opie and Anthony show's interview style, characterized by its intentionally awkward moments.  To illustrate, they aired an archived interview with Barbara Borman, Linda Lovelace's sister. The interview, initiated with a cringe-worthy "huge fans of porno" comment, was riddled with uncomfortable silences and tense exchanges. Despite the awkward start, Borman eventually discussed Lovelace's death and the fundraiser established for her grandchildren's college fund.

Another segment featured a previously aired interview with Francine, a former Opie and Anthony intern known for her lack of intelligence.  This interview, which included Louis Black, veered into discussions of healthcare, race, dating preferences, and culminated in Francine sharing a humorous, yet potentially offensive, personal anecdote.  Ron Bennington, a frequent guest on the main show, called in to discuss his own programs and his new self-proclaimed title, "The Great Ron Bennington."  The broadcast concluded with more cleanup discussion and promotions for the Opie and Anthony show's social media platforms.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  The virus. Sirius XM.  Hey, hey, hey!  And now, the Opie and Anthony show continues.  This is After 0 and 8 Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  Yeah, Opie and Anthony are gone.  Very good timing on their part, because we're all still cleaning up the studio.  I don't know how much of that translated to the air.  I know Opie was filming, but during that last read,  the last live read that Ant was doing at the end of the show,  Bob Kelly, Joe DeRosa, and Bill Burr all decided to find whatever they could 
[00:00:30]  and just start winging it at Ant as hard as they could.  Napkins, ketchup packets, bottles, cups, whatever they could find.  They were just chucking it at him while he was doing this read  to the point where it looked like a landfill was surrounding his area here in the studio.  And, of course, Ant, the consummate professional that he is,  went through the entire live read.  He didn't miss a beat.  He went through the whole thing getting stuff winged at him the whole time. 
[00:01:00]  I was just picking ketchup packets out from behind our sound machines here.  And once the read was done, he decided it was time for revenge,  and he started winging things as hard as he could back at them.  One chair ended up getting a banana smushed on it.  Let's just say Travis just picked up his keyboard, and the keyboard was dripping with water.  I don't know if that's a good sign for electronics.  I'm not the electronics guy.  But generally speaking, that's not a good sign. 
[00:01:30]  E-Rock, you stuck into that other studio.  That was probably the only safe place for you.  Yeah, but I was watching water being whipped across the studio  and splashing into the window right here that's in front of me.  We just have to make sure.  It hit the window?  Yeah, you can see it all over in here.  Yeah, see, we're making sure that the studio's nice when Ron and Fez come in.  We don't want to disrupt them.  Except there are water stains on the walls.  Yeah, even over by the doors.  You can see it, right?  The TV over there has some water going down the screen.  The clock. 
[00:02:00]  The TV does?  Yeah, it's everywhere.  Generally speaking, when you have a television,  is it a good sign for there to be water dripping down the screen?  I'm thinking tomorrow we bring in super soakers.  Yeah, I just really take this to the next level.  But, I mean, it looks like we're going to be able to clean up most of it on our own.  You know, it was a strange end to the show when Travis, Danny, and me are all...  Everybody had paper towels drying off studio equipment.  But I think we got it in time. 
[00:02:30]  Everything appears to be in working order.  And as long as you can hear me out there, something's working all right.  We just heard from E-Rock.  Danny and Travis just went down the hall.  I think they're getting more garbage bags.  Everybody's also excited here.  I don't know where Roland is.  But we said this before.  Roland gets all flustered and excited whenever there's a big guest in here.  Regardless of whether it's his or not,  Cara Diaguardi's in here doing a whole bunch of shows.  And Roland's all running around as if it's his guest. 
[00:03:00]  That's the girl that was on American Idol, right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  The judge.  She got kicked off.  Now she's got a book, I guess.  Why don't we get her on at 10 o'clock?  I'll see what we can do.  Yeah, let's get her on After Opie and Anthony Live.  This is the show to be on right now.  All right.  I mean, you just missed all that action that was happening during the commercial break  and during that live read.  But I'm sure Opie had all the comedians, Bob Kelly, Joe DeRosa, Bill Burr.  They were all outside the studio watching Opie's flip cam.  So I didn't get to see it. 
[00:03:30]  But I'm sure he got good video footage.  It'll be probably on, what is it, Opie Radio fans on Facebook?  Yeah.  What, did you not remember his Twitter name for a second?  I mean, his Facebook name for a second?  Or were you just trying to sound casual?  No, because there's Opie Radio, there's Opie Radio fans, like there's people who imitate  his page.  He was super psyched that the whole melee went down because he got to step outside and when  he was done, he realized he had his video for the day.  So he was okay with it.  Four hours of radio, but he got his video.  He got his video done for the day.  And I'm sure, actually, it's going to be hilarious. 
[00:04:00]  It'll be up on Opie Radio on YouTube.  But, E-Rock, that's not the only thing we brought up today.  We had a whole conversation.  You know, Ron Bennington has his interview show, Ron Bennington Interviews, and, you know,  he goes in-depth with people.  He's also got Unmasked, where he takes comedians and kind of peels back the layers of what makes  a comedian a comedian.  He goes in-depth with people, and he really gets to the heart of things.  He's commended on his interview style. 
[00:04:30]  Whereas the Opie and Anthony show, as we discussed, more specializes in finding those  uncomfortable moments with people.  And not, like, noteworthy, uncomfortable moments with people, but moments where it's  just like, that was just awkward and hard to deal with.  We've been doing it for so long now.  One person that we did it with, and I wanted to share one moment.  Now, we are going to work on a special, which is just uncomfortable Opie and Anthony interviews.  The most uncomfortable interviews. 
[00:05:00]  But since we were talking about it today, I figured we'd share at least some of that  with you.  And one moment that we dug up from the archives.  This was from a long time ago.  Linda Lovelace.  I always say loveless, but I always get made fun of it.  Lovelace.  Lovelace.  Big porno star, of course.  Deep Throat.  She died.  And her sister was calling up, I guess, raising money for Linda's funeral.  Yeah, they couldn't afford, like, a coffin and the funeral expenses and whatnot. 
[00:05:30]  And, of course, Linda, later in her life, turned around and was against the porno industry.  And I guess her sister was on her side fighting that cause.  So, Opie and Anthony interviewed Linda Lovelace's sister.  And here's what happened with the uncomfortableness as we now deal with the uncomfortableness of  this disaster that's a studio as we try to clean it up before Ron and Fez come on.  And here it is, Linda Lovelace's sister on After Opie and Anthony Live. 
[00:06:00]  After Opie and Anthony Live.  Anthony, breaking news.  We got Linda Lovelace's daughter.  Daughter?  No.  Sister.  I'm sorry.  Sister on the phone.  Barbara Borman.  There's a very tragic story in the New York papers about Linda Lovelace, right?  Yeah, she died.  She died, which is very sad.  We're huge fans of porno.  Oh, stop it.  Well, I know later in life.  I know the whole story.  We'll get into it with Linda Lovelace's sister.  Later on in life, she didn't want anything to do with that. 
[00:06:30]  We understand all that.  Even at the time, it seems that there were things going on that she wasn't very happy  with what she was doing.  Right.  Well, the papers are reporting that they don't have enough money to bury Linda Lovelace.  Yeah.  Oh, she hung up.  See?  Because I said something stupid, right?  See?  I knew it, Opie.  Oh.  What did I say?  Hey, you can't say we're big fans of porno.  I knew she would hang up.  Very sensitive about that.  Very.  But then I kind of corrected myself real fast. 
[00:07:00]  No, no.  That was enough.  Oh.  The way that family is and the sister, forget about it.  Oh.  Oh.  Are you?  Oh.  Oh.  I knew it.  That's why I was completely like playing like forget it.  But why don't we do our little trick that we do?  I don't know.  That ain't gonna work.  Oh.  That ain't gonna work.  Oh.  Oh.  The big one that got away.  Oh. 
[00:07:30]  The big one that got away.  Oh.  We were gonna pay for her funeral, man.  I know.  Jesus.  Well, let's just wait.  Oh, wait.  She's back.  Barbara.  Barbara.  Hello.  Hi.  Are you mad at us?  I am not interested in speaking about Linda Lovelace and the pornography.  Okay.  That's fair enough.  Well, I heard a little laugh and it upsets me.  Hold on.  Hold on.  There was no one laughing.  No, no, no, no, no.  Oh, we laugh at stupid things, but we weren't laughing.  No, nothing like that.  I'm very familiar with the story, as a matter of fact. 
[00:08:00]  We were just trying to explain to people who she was.  That's all.  Yeah.  We understand the family's stance on this whole thing.  That she was basically assaulted.  That's how that...  Got that right.  ...what that amounted to.  The woman did not want to do this, and she was taken advantage of and spent the rest of  her life as an advocate for people put in the same situation.  Yes, she did.  And now she just recently died on Monday, I guess.  I'm sorry.  Thank you.  And it was three weeks after a car accident. 
[00:08:30]  She had a horrific car accident.  Yeah.  Yeah, what happened?  It seems like, I think, a tie rod...  It's under investigation.  It seems that I was told that a tie rod broke, and her seatbelt broke.  The car rolled over three or four times, and she was thrown about 38 feet out of the windshield.  Oh, Jesus.  She broke both legs, shattered elbow, and pelvis was broken.  Now, she was in, I guess, financial straits here, it seems... 
[00:09:00]  She died penniless.  Penniless.  So, um...  And if you would like to have people send to a fund that's being sent up for her...  Yeah.  ...I can give you that information.  Well, how much does a funeral cost?  How much of the...  I have no idea.  You have no idea?  No.  It is...  Well, aren't you guys burying her tomorrow?  Tomorrow is her funeral.  She's being cremated.  Oh, okay.  Uh-huh.  And what do you need money for?  Because we would like to... 
[00:09:30]  It's not me.  It's what's been set up for her grandchildren.  Oh.  Oh, see, it sounded like they...  Because we're reading Linda Lovelace, kin, can't afford her burial.  Well, my father's out there to help her.  Oh, okay.  Well, I kind of wanted to pay for the funeral for the gal.  Well, that's pretty darn nice.  Well, so you have enough money to bury her?  Honey, I'm in Florida.  I don't...  I'm not there, and I don't want to go there. 
[00:10:00]  Oh, why not?  Because I'd rather remember the way she was, and the wonderful times we had together.  My father is there.  Right.  And her son is coming home.  He's due in tonight.  He's in the National Guard.  And his daughter is there, too.  I mean, her daughter.  Is it that you don't have the means to go, or you just would rather not go?  Both.  You know, it's pretty expensive to go out, and I'm just going to stay home and grieve with 
[00:10:30]  myself.  There you go.  Do you...  In my heart, I feel better right here.  Do you have any...  Has anyone had any contact with that first husband of hers?  What, that idiot?  Yeah.  Chuck Traynor?  Yeah, yeah, that guy.  No one has had any contact with that.  No one?  And no one is trying to...  He hasn't tried to contact anybody now that she's died?  I'm sure not.  Interesting.  Any memories of Linda Lovelace you'd like to share with our audience this afternoon, Barbara? 
[00:11:00]  As my youngest sister, she was my baby doll.  I was 16 when she was born.  She was a beautiful little girl.  A very happy little girl.  And then all hell broke loose.  But she and I were always very close.  Yeah.  And I wish to remember those memories of that.  Yeah.  And I can give you a call out there to help with expenses or what. 
[00:11:30]  Yeah, we would like to do something nice for Linda Lovelace.  Opie, yes.  We would.  So what is...  A fund is being set up.  Yes.  And this fund is for?  Linda Lovelace Memorial Fund.  A fund is going to be set up in lieu of flowers into an account for her grandchildren's college fund. 
[00:12:00]  Right.  And, uh...  Well, now here's another tip here.  Her funeral expenses are being covered.  Oh, oh, they are.  They are.  They are.  I'm just reading my notes from her sister-in-law.  Her first, um...  Yeah.  What do you call a check?  Oh, good.  So...  She was on disability and it came the day after she died. 
[00:12:30]  But anyway, she has a sister-in-law out there who's handling all of this and doing very well.  But she has said that people are calling her and wanting to donate and so on.  Yeah.  So, if you want to, I can give you the account number, the name of the bank.  Well, we shouldn't, uh, you know, have that kind of information, uh, put out on the air, I don't think.  But is there a phone number, perhaps?  Or, uh, somewhere where people might be able to get in touch and send a donation?  Are you, are you okay? 
[00:13:00]  You can send a donation to me and I can forward it.  Okay.  If you want to, that's entirely up to you.  Right.  Well, um...  I can give you the...  The name of the bank.  The name of the bank.  Yeah, let's, uh, let's, uh, give out the name of the bank.  Uh, if you're just tuning in, Linda Lovelace, um, uh, died tragically in a car accident on Monday.  Yeah, and we're just, uh, there's a fund.  And we got Barbara on the phone.  Her, uh, her loving sister.  You're, you're the older sister? 
[00:13:30]  Yes, I am.  Ah.  And we lost another school.  No!  Anyway, are you ready for this?  Uh, yes, yes.  All right.  Andrew, you owe me a thousand.  Yes.  It's Wells Fargo Bank, Englewood, Colorado.  Okay.  Barbara, you all right?  I'm all right, yeah.  Cindy, where's the account number?  Is this it?  Yes.  Eight, three, two.  Eight, eight, three, eight. 
[00:14:00]  Oh, Hunter.  Oh, yeah, give it to her.  Okay.  And I want to thank everybody from coast to coast, north and south, for a full year.  Oh, yeah.  And who, and their condolences.  Right.  And she was a lovely girl.  I bet, Barbara.  Well, thank you so much for spending a few minutes with us today and giving us a little  remembrance of Linda.  And she was advocating.  I wish you could have heard her speeches.  They were unbelievable. 
[00:14:30]  Yeah.  And she did a great job.  Mm, stick it in my mouth.  You know.  Yeah.  Uh, she'll be a legend.  Pussah!  I bet.  I bet.  Well, uh, best of luck to you, Barbara.  Thank you very much.  I think Barbara really needs to give out that account number again.  Do you think?  Do we get it?  Uh, just, uh, the account number once again.  One more time.  All right.  I'm sorry, Barbara.  That's okay.  Eight, three, two.  Eight, eight, three, eight. 
[00:15:00]  Penises.  Okay.  Thank you very much, Barbara.  Okay, thank you for calling.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  There she goes.  Where do I hand in my, um, membership card to the human race?  Do I, do I just burn it or do I have to turn it back in?  Do I have to turn it in?  Do I have to give it to somebody?  Or do I just wait for it to expire?  Holy Jesus!  Whew, that was, uh, awful.  After ONA, it's live. 
[00:15:30]  That's what it is.  After ONA, I am Sam Roberts.  You already knew that.  And that was just one example of how uncomfortable our interviews get here on the O.B. and Anthony  show.  And like we discussed earlier on today's show, uh, we are going to make some kind of special,  maybe a series of special, on all of the uncomfortable interviews.  Because everybody has a specialty.  I mean, anybody can do a great interview, right?  But it takes a real, a real legend to do a bad one. 
[00:16:00]  To do a real uncomfortable interview.  Now, uh, apparently Carrie DiGuardi can't come on the show.  No.  I just want her for a minute.  I tried, uh, her reps are even cutting her time with other shows.  Well, it's probably a good thing that she doesn't come in here.  Because, uh, while that bit was playing, I picked up Anthony's toys to put them away.  The, the, the slide horn and the, and the bell and all the things that Anthony plays with  on the air.  And, uh, I got wet when I put the toys away. 
[00:16:30]  So, obviously, the studio is still a mess.  Because I don't know where the water came from, but there's water everywhere.  Where, uh, uh, Ron and Fez guys are now setting up the studio.  And they look, like, what, what is going on?  One of the chairs was soaking wet for a little while.  But we're cleaning everything up, okay?  There was banana all over the floor.  There was.  Did you get that, by the way?  Yeah, it's, I think I got all of it.  You're a good guy.  There was.  There was banana goo on the floor.  Which, uh, reportedly looked like semen.  Uh, yeah.  That was a little weird. 
[00:17:00]  It was very liquidy.  Yeah, since Ron and Fez are setting up the banners now.  Well, not Ron and Fez, but their crew.  I would assume that there will be guests coming in today.  So you probably don't want a studio that looks like a garbage war zone, uh, while there's  guests in here.  Does the studio smell?  Mm, I can't.  I've been in here for too long.  I don't know.  Okay.  Does it usually?  Well, I, all that garbage was thrown around, so I didn't know.  Well, it wasn't, like, garbage, garbage.  It was, like, actually, I don't know what it was.  It could have smelled.  Uh, but it was mainly napkins and stuff like that.  Bob Kelly took full stacks of napkins and just chucked them at Anthony while he was doing 
[00:17:30]  the live read.  Dude, the video will be up later on, uh, Opie's YouTube, I'm sure.  Roland, are we going to get some guests on the 10 o'clock today?  Um, no.  Why not?  Because I know who the hell you are.  We still.  I mean, it's...  No, I'm just kidding.  No, no, they had to, um, the person that you want is cutting...  Carrie D. Gwardy?  Yeah, she's cutting her tour short, like, 20 minutes.  All right.  She has to do a photo shoot.  So, can we get someone else?  What about that, uh, the girl with Hits 1?  Shut up, Eric. 
[00:18:00]  Shut up.  Shut up.  No.  Nobody's asking you who else.  Okay.  Who's this ass?  I don't know, Roland.  Jesus Christ.  Why are you making me angry?  Oh, who are you saying?  I think he was saying whoever was in there with Hits 1.  Oh, the blonde girl, the Disney?  Yeah, from Allie and AJ.  Oh, from Disney?  Yeah, that's...  That's a little risky, right?  What?  You think Spencer's going to lead her in here?  Well, we have the Ron and Fez banners up.  We can...  No, we're not going to blame it on it.  Yeah, no, I'll just go ask.  You guys are talking about underage dating.  Yeah, it'll be fine. 
[00:18:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Good call.  Hey, Disney, what's up?  Yeah, 15-year-old.  We were talking about underage dating for a while on this morning's show.  Yeah, no, no, I think she's like 17 or something like that.  Wow, who knows?  Yeah, so...  That also...  I would say...  Well...  I mean, for you, though, you...  I mean...  I wasn't talking about it.  No, no, no, I think you'll be fine, but I just, like, Disney, I'm going to walk in  here, like, hi, guys.  Okay, let's talk and go find out if we can get her in here.  What?  Wow!  Go find out if we can get her in here.  He said less talking. 
[00:19:00]  Who?  Iraq said that to you.  Eat your sandwich.  Your sandwich?  Sure.  Well, what we were talking about...  Don't let him eat your sandwich, Roland.  I'm hungry now.  Because I just said a sandwich.  Now I'm thinking of a sandwich to eat.  Well, we were talking about underage girls.  We were also talking about dating elderly women and all the different dating pools.  It led to Ant being questioned about dating black women.  Now, normally, one would think that this would never happen, but Ant said that he would have  banged Francine. 
[00:19:30]  Francine was an intern for ONA a long, long time ago.  So, since then, she's come on the show a whole bunch of times.  She's made an impact with being known for being dumb, is actually what she's mainly famous  for, not being intelligent.  She came in, in 2009, while Louis Black was here, and they discussed health care.  Is that correct?  Yeah, she kind of just walked in while Louis was already in the studio.  I think Bruno Mars is here, though.  Tell Bruno to come in.  We'll play this bit, and then have Bruno come in for a minute. 
[00:20:00]  We'll cut into the bit.  All right.  Have Bruno come in.  Go!  Can you get that done?  What?  Go get him!  Don't yell!  Here it is.  We're introducing you to Francine, for those of you who don't know, and for those of you  who do remember with us.  She hasn't been on the show in a while.  Hopefully, she'll be on soon.  But this is Francine barging in while Louis Black was in studio, and the two political minds  come together to discuss health care, right here on After Opie and Anthony Live.  After Opie and Anthony Live. 
[00:20:30]  I just got distracted.  That is completely wrong.  Watching Francine actually deep-throat a banana was pretty good.  Your technique...  Is the vag holding up, Francine?  I was supposed to be deep-throaring a dick last night, but...  What happened?  What happened?  I got hungover.  I was...  I had a headache.  Oh, man.  So I couldn't get to Brooklyn to get to my sex buddy.  It was really bad.  Brooklyn?  No, I didn't bring in my birthday with some good sex.  Which kind of sucked.  Oh.  Black guy?  I haven't been able to find a white guy lately.  What the fuck? 
[00:21:00]  They're all over the place.  They like Asians now, so...  What?  Yeah.  Is that what the deal is?  It's been like that forever.  If a white guy is going out of just whiteness, it's Asian?  Yeah.  I see a lot more black couples around.  Usually, it's black guys, white girls, but the...  Exactly.  Yeah, yeah.  She's right about the Asian thing.  White guys love Asian shirts.  What's going on?  I don't know what...  Do this with your eyes.  Let's see.  Well, there are more in.  Let's see if you can...  Yeah, yeah.  There are more of them coming over.  They are.  Louis, could she pass her in Asia if she did this? 
[00:21:30]  Yeah, but I'm not Asian enough.  You look like very tan Asian.  Really?  Yeah.  Thank you.  You look spectacular.  Let's...  I mean, really.  Thank you, Louis.  Thank you, Louis.  Really, seriously, you could be a fruitsicle.  I don't give a shit.  I'm serious.  What...  How do people pick by race now?  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Well, you are...  Are you who, too?  I'm Tootsie.  You're Tootsie.  She's a Tootsie.  Are you really?  She's a Tootsie.  Yeah.  You can tell.  Look at her.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's the longer, thinner arms and fingers and stuff. 
[00:22:00]  Yeah.  What are you talking?  It's great.  What documentary have you watched recently?  Jimmy the Greeks.  She's an obvious...  She's an obvious...  He told us all what it was about.  Jimmy the Greeks.  Jimmy the Greek reference.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  See, you know, they talked about that.  And the colonists, the people that were colonizing, had really started some shit between the two  by saying that one was superior to the other.  And we are. 
[00:22:30]  See?  And it stopped.  See?  And that's why there was mass genocide going on in Rwanda.  Way to take the sexy out of the segment.  Jimmy lost his heart on it.  Yeah, really.  It was great for a while.  I thought it was getting sexy.  Get the kid to get the genocides.  Jesus.  All we need now is Don Cheadle crying.  Are the Tootsies really number one?  Yep.  And who's the worst?  I can't really say it. 
[00:23:00]  It's politically incorrect.  Just say it.  Yeah, you might as well.  Oh, come on, you guys.  Let's just make believe we're not on the radio.  Who would it be?  South Africans.  Kenyans.  Kenyans are cool.  If they were still around.  Somalians.  Somalians.  Okay, we'll say the Somalians.  No, who would you say?  You had one.  Well, who are the best?  The worst.  Why are you holding back now?  Because you're 30?  That's not cool.  We're not trying to start any more wars.  Oh, look at what happened to her.  She turns 30 and she's all like, oh. 
[00:23:30]  That's what I would say anything.  That's what happens.  You're talking about when you're fucking, when you miscarried into a toilet and started laughing.  Come on, that was hilarious.  It is one of the greatest moments ever on this show, to be honest with you.  We might have to replay that.  One of the greatest moments of my life.  I don't doubt it.  It was minus $200 if I had to fucking get an abortion.  Yeah.  And I didn't have any money and I was working at Burger King.  That fucking shit coming out of me was a lifesaver. 
[00:24:00]  That's good.  I walked out of there feeling so good.  Like, yeah.  So you're into Obama's health care plan?  I think it's a good idea.  However, it's not at a good time.  There's no money.  And really and truly, I think we should just try to get jobs back and just let the people  who have stuff just die for now.  Wow.  Well, after the miscarriage thing, we can move right into this.  Up until the very end, it sounded like this is a good point. 
[00:24:30]  Yeah, really.  You would just...  The wheels fell off.  What a silly point.  What a good point.  You blew it.  She's retarded.  But there's no jobs.  She blew an axle on that one.  Dear.  There are no jobs.  Yeah, there are no jobs.  45,000 people a year die because there's not health care.  Got it?  More than you die in a war.  Okay?  Get a grip.  So there should be more people that die of that health care, I guess.  Get a grip on it.  But then get the jobs back first.  Get jobs more. 
[00:25:00]  So that they can...  So that...  What?  But if there are no jobs, people are not going to eat.  Would you rather eat or have people die?  Do we go into Afghanistan too?  No.  You should pull out, but then they're just going to continue going crazy over there.  Yeah, well, I'll tell you the health...  The Iranians are going to take over if they leave Afghanistan.  Or is it Iraq?  Whatever.  There we go.  Same shit.  I can't believe I'm arguing.  I got my money on Francine so far.  Yeah.  Lois, you're not making any good points yet.  I listen to NPR every day now.  Yeah?  Perfect.  Let her run it. 
[00:25:30]  She listens to NPR, Lois.  All fucking day.  And then C-SPAN after.  I go outside, that's all I see.  NPR.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  I'm really knowledgeable now.  Are you?  About everything.  Really?  Like what?  Because Lois is here.  He's a knowledgeable man.  I say we hold off on the health care.  Why?  Well, we're already in the middle of it.  Yeah, we're about to get it, but like...  No, no, no.  Come and explain health care.  They're debating.  It's fairly simple.  Lois, I would love to hear you.  This is what we're going to do, okay?  Because it's never going to get better because we're idiots. 
[00:26:00]  All right?  That's the basic...  No, we're the best.  We are?  Really?  Yeah.  What planet do you live on?  Better than everybody else in the whole world.  What?  Better than the Sens.  We're the best that was.  And the Brits.  And everybody...  America's the best.  Really?  Have you been to those other places?  Yes, I have.  I've been there.  Oh, shit.  Sorry.  And they suck.  Look at what they're saying now.  When he's talking about, you know, we should just pull out of Afghanistan, they're saying  they wish your dad had pulled out.  Oh, see.  Oh, see.  Oh, see.  Yeah.  That just gets ugly. 
[00:26:30]  That's terrible.  It was an accident, and I was already told that, and I'm good with it.  Oh, really?  Yes.  They had to tell you that?  Yeah.  Why would they tell you that?  Why not?  It's a truth.  Why would they tell you?  By the way, Lewis, thank you.  Kevin from Connecticut, yes.  I have to remind you that she is a college graduate, too.  Yes.  That is correct.  Well, I didn't...  What did I say?  So she knows her shit.  Well, I don't give a shit.  Is America the greatest place on Earth, Lewis?  No.  Number one.  I want to hear Lewis's take on health care.  It's fairly simple. 
[00:27:00]  All right.  What we have right now in terms of health care in this country is a pile of shit.  Okay?  It stinks.  All right?  And what they're going to do...  Oh, yeah, it does.  I had health care.  It was really good.  Well, congratulations.  You had health care.  You're sitting over a toilet.  It's having a miscarriage.  Don't tell me you had health care.  How good is your health care if you're a son of a bitch?  Hold on.  You're shitting on your baby.  That's because I didn't want my mom to know I was 17.  Otherwise, I would have gotten my free abortion.  Thank you.  Not your free abortion. 
[00:27:30]  Whatever.  It's $250 at the free clinic.  I was going to go to the clinic, whatever those clinics are called.  Lewis says it's a pile of shit.  I want to hear more from you.  It is a pile of shit.  I have three health insurance companies, and all they do, literally all they do, is argue  over who's going to pay my bill.  Okay?  I had a colonoscopy, because that's what you're supposed to have when you turn this age.  Oh, you've got a lot to look forward to.  I hope I don't have to get one.  Oh, you're going to have to get one, and by then, they're going to do it with a larger  thing. 
[00:28:00]  I've got a probe for you.  Yeah, they're going to say the small one isn't big enough.  That's what the next...  But it took them a year to pay that off.  Wow.  Like, I asked to do it.  Like, I said, you know, I could go to the Aruba this week, but what I'd really like  to do is shove a submarine up my ass.  That's what it is.  And why is Rob Cross talking to my co-host again?  Why?  Rob Cross is distracting again.  Thank God.  There he is. 
[00:28:30]  The great Rob Bennington.  It was almost two days in a row.  Does Rob Cross just stand outside that studio waiting for you to come in so he can stop you  from coming in here?  No, what he does is, like, this is our meeting, so you know how they catch O&A walking to  the elevator?  They try to catch me walking from the elevator.  Oh, I got it, because that way they only have to make one trip.  But all he ever talks to me about is the things I shouldn't mention.  Don't mention this.  Look, do me a favor. 
[00:29:00]  Well, why doesn't he just write it down and pass you a note every day?  Just leave it on your spot here.  Here's what you can't talk about today.  Then why would he have a job?  This is what you do when you're in management.  You have to figure out why you belong.  How can I put my fingerprint on it?  Yeah, you can't tell him.  I got to tell him.  I got to be the guy.  Yeah, it would be impossible not to.  Yeah, I see that people are trying to stop the Ronnie and Sammy Sweetheart show.  Yeah, it didn't happen yesterday.  The fans were outraged.  But, you know, this is the second time I've been on here in two of the last three days. 
[00:29:30]  But I got the moniker, The Great Ron Bennington, and I really like it a lot.  I really hope it sticks.  Jimmy used it the other day.  Uh-huh.  You're using it today.  I like it.  We haven't had a great one since Gretzky or Gleason.  So from now on, maybe that's your title.  The Great Rob Bennington.  Yeah.  I mean, I don't...  And Sam Roberts present Ronnie and Sammy Sweethearts.  I like the present, too.  I got that from Jerry Weintraub.  You've got to put presents on there.  I know you're a friend of his from a long time ago.  I know you and E-Rock tend to know what the kids are watching on TV, right? 
[00:30:00]  Oh, yes.  So I'm walking in today, and Fifth Avenue was screaming girls, and they were shooting a scene.  And I think it's TV.  But the guy's name was, like, Carl, or Kerry is a big, tall, black-haired kid, and I never saw him before.  Is it Gossip Girl?  I don't know what any of these shows are, so I wouldn't know.  But is there, like, some kind of teen favorite?  And they're filming around here?  Yeah, over on Fifth Avenue.  It's got to be Gossip Girl.  Yeah.  That's the big show now.  I would think so. 
[00:30:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  The kids love Gossip Girl.  But you've got another interview to start off your show.  Yeah.  So we're not going to be able to go along here.  Well, give me the pronunciation, because I also know that you follow these shows.  Is it?  You got Cara Diaguardi.  Diaguardi.  That's what it is.  Okay.  Roland was walking around calling her Diaguardi over.  Yeah, don't give me any false pronunciations.  It's Diaguardi.  I watched American Idol every season she was on.  Diaguardi.  Cara Diaguardi.  She was your favorite?  She was great, yeah.  She's a big songwriter. 
[00:31:00]  Yeah, she's done a lot.  She's written with everybody.  Yeah.  So we talked a lot about songwriters, so I thought it would be interesting to talk to  her about it.  But I noticed everyone's just talking about, you know, date rape with her.  Yeah, that's all.  They just got the little chunk of the book that the publicist sends out.  The tiniest part.  Yeah, yeah.  What you could do, you should have like Fez or somebody sing, then she could judge them.  Well, I don't think she does that anymore, right?  She's done with that.  No, but she got fired.  She didn't quit.  Maybe she still wants to.  But she wanted to quit.  She wanted to quit before she was fired.  It's like all of us on radio.  Did you watch the show last night where the chairs turn around? 
[00:31:30]  The voice, yeah.  It's taped months ago.  It didn't feel fresh at all.  I do like the, I don't know whether I want to turn my chair around.  This is the whole point of the show, is will someone turn their chair around?  Yeah, or I'm just singing to people's backs.  And then they turn around at the end and say, yeah, I wasn't going to turn around.  Yeah.  Well, I will let you get to your interview and the Ron and Fez show, of course, because  I'm sure there is a multitude of things planned for that show today.  Good.  Back to my nickname. 
[00:32:00]  Stay tuned.  The great Ron Bennington and Fez continues on the virus.  We'll see you tomorrow with more Opie and Anthony and after Opie and Anthony Live.  Opie and Anthony show is now over.  For real this time.  Check out the O&A show on Facebook at facebook.com slash Opie and Anthony.
