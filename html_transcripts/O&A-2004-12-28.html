<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a bizarre, nonsensical song about a race, followed by station identification and a brief, nonsensical recorded segment featuring Al Franken.  The hosts then celebrated XM Satellite Radio's subscriber count exceeding 3.1 million, mocking a competitor.  The conversation quickly shifted to Jimmy Norton's sleep deprivation, blamed on a stuffy nose and an encounter with an attractive woman, sparking crude jokes about Norton's dating life, his apartment's smell, and his home d√©cor (rocks and candles).

The discussion then turned to Richard Pryor's frail health, leading to a contemplation of society's desensitization to violence, particularly in light of the recent tsunami.  The hosts shared their experiences with graphic footage, including a musically-edited video of Bud Dwyer's suicide, contrasting public outrage over Janet Jackson's wardrobe malfunction with the relative indifference to tsunami imagery.  Producer Ben's audible yawning became a brief comedic interlude before the hosts returned to discussing the tsunami's potential impact on New York City and media reactions.

A contentious phone call with the recurring caller "Lady Di," known for her alcoholism, followed.  The conversation detailed her Christmas Day drinking incident, a 911 call, and her roommate's attempts to intervene.  The hosts and Lady Di engaged in a vulgar and argumentative exchange, with the hosts mocking her drinking and lying.  The discussion included insults about her appearance and alleged attempts to seduce her roommate, culminating in a chaotic back-and-forth with another unidentified caller.  A later call with Lady Di, this time with Jim, seemingly her sponsor, proved equally confrontational, highlighting her resentment towards authority and lack of progress in recovery.  She revealed calling the police on her roommate for hiding her wine and defended her actions.  The call ended with Lady Di remaining defiant.

After the Lady Di segments, the show incorporated listener call-ins (including a dedicated "F.U. line"), advertisements, sports updates, and discussions about Liza Minnelli's injury and the death of Yankee Stadium's organist, Eddie Leighton.  Upcoming segments featuring five women and music mashups were briefly mentioned.  Throughout, profanity and vulgar language were prevalent.

A significant portion of the show was devoted to a discussion about prostitutes, fueled by numerous crude jokes and tangents.  Callers shared their experiences, ranging from positive encounters in Nevada brothels and Buffalo in-call services to negative experiences with scams and unsanitary conditions.  Norton recounted his own experiences, including a near-scam and a near-miss encounter with a sex worker who later died of AIDS.  The conversation included tangents about Christopher Reeve, *Taxi Driver*, and a nonsensical song about AIDS.  Comedian Adam Ferrara joined the show, and the hosts speculated about the women attending an upcoming studio party.  Sexually explicit jokes and references permeated this segment.

Another segment began with a caller's humorous anecdote about a little person struggling with a miniature shopping cart.  The hosts then discussed their security guard, "Master Poe," a martial arts expert with a colorful past, who briefly appeared in-studio.  The focus shifted to a planned segment with women who applied to be on the show, eventually reduced to three due to identification issues.  The hosts discussed the women's potential nudity and used offensive language.  A call to a Nevada escort service by a caller with Tourette's Syndrome ensued.  Following an email complaint regarding the show's content, three women and several large men promoting a testosterone booster called Gamma-O arrived.  The women engaged in nudity and simulated sexual activity, while the hosts made sexually explicit comments.  The segment concluded with discussions of future plans to feature more women (with proper identification), a remixed version of U2's "Sunday Bloody Sunday" using President Bush's speeches, and the "fuck you" messages segment.

Finally, the broadcast included XM Satellite Radio commercials (including the Delphi SkyFi 2 and gift cards), a ski and snowboard report, a call from WWF Champion Arun Sheik (who repeatedly mispronounced "Opie"), further sexually explicit discussions about women's appearances, a discussion about Celine Dion and her photo book, a segment where Lady Di fell asleep on hold, a comedic DMX/James Taylor remix, discussion of Mark Wahlberg's singing and the movie *Boogie Nights*, analysis of Wesley Willis's "Rock and Roll McDonald's,"  a "What did we learn today?" segment featuring listener takeaways, and more XM Satellite Radio and sports programming commercials.  The show was characterized throughout by frequent profanity and vulgarity.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  My ship is a-goin' and I just can't pretend!  My ship is a-goin' and I just can't pretend!  Reluctantly crouched at the starting line.  Engines pumping and thumping in time.  The green light flashes, the flags go up.  Churning and burning, they yearn for the cup.  They deftly maneuver and muscle for rank.  Few burning fast on an empty tank.  Reckless and wild, they pour through the turns.  Their prowess is potent and secretly stern. 
[00:00:30]  As they speed through the finish, the flags go down.  The fans get up and they get out of town.  The arena is empty except for one man.  Still driving and striving as fast as he can.  The sun has gone down and the moon has come up.  And long ago somebody left with the cup.  But he's driving and striving and hugging the turns.  And thanking of someone for whom he still burns.  He's going the distance!  He's going for speed.  He's going for speed. 
[00:01:00]  She's all alone.  All alone!  All alone in a time of need.  Because he's racing and pacing and plotting the course.  He's fighting and fighting and riding on his horse.  He's going the distance!  And gone!  Yeah!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!

[00:03:30]  Thank you. 
[00:04:00]  Thank you. 
[00:04:30]  Thank you. 
[00:05:00]  Thank you. 
[00:05:30]  Thank you. 
[00:06:00]  Thank you. 
[00:06:30]  Thank you. 
[00:07:00]  Thank you. 
[00:07:30]  Yeah, I'm Al Franken and I'm at a Covenants Convention.  Are you having a good time? 
[00:08:00]  I am.  Who have you talked to so far?  Booyan.  Booyan.  Mya.  Mya.  You know, I couldn't agree more.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was really nice talking to you.  I'm glad you're here.  Yeah.  I think it's fabulous.  Can I shake your hand? 
[00:08:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Thanks a lot.  Thank you very much.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Good time.  Thank you. 
[00:09:00]  Hey, that Southern guy is my favorite new clip, man. 
[00:09:30]  That is a good one.  Good morning.  Hello.  You're listening to the Opie and Anthony program.  We like to call it the ONA virus because it is like a virus.  We don't know what it is about this show, but it gets under your skin and it festers there  and then you find yourself going, you know, I can't live without this damn thing.  Sometimes it leaves pustules.  And it's such a great virus that you want to infect others like your friends and coworkers  and eventually it just spreads and spreads and spreads and there's nothing you can do about it. 
[00:10:00]  You're hooked, right?  Then you're hooked.  And XM Satellite Radio is the number one satellite radio company by far.  By far.  Oh, yeah.  Congratulations to the whole gang down in, what are you guys whispering about?  Ben apparently can't hear the headphones again, so we're trying to fix it.  Thank you. 
[00:10:30]  Well, here, try this.  Might as well get this out of the way.  How's that?  That one.  Does that work?  That's the one.  That's the one?  That's that.  Anyway, yeah, I want to congratulate everyone down in, what do you need?  Holy S.  I can barely hear myself.  I try to do it with hand signals, so you just, you know, pop it up.  There we go.  All right.  Is everyone happy with their volumes?  I hope so.  It changes from day to day sometimes.  You know what the odd thing is?  I turn up my headphones, I hear you, I hear everybody fine, and then I try to talk and 
[00:11:00]  I don't hear me in the headphones.  Do you have a headphone volume over there?  Yeah, but then you're, and everyone else is blasting loud in my ears, and then I could  like barely hear me.  Is Mars listening to that?  Mars will take care of that later, Anthony.  He's a genius.  Much better now, though.  He's here today, so all the equipment's going to work fine.  All right.  He took yesterday off, and all hell broke loose around here.  That's me.  Microphone diva.  I want to congratulate everyone down in Washington, Anthony.  XM Satellite Radio is over 3.1 million subscribers. 
[00:11:30]  That seems to be their primary mission in life, is to get those subs, because everything  else just kind of falls to the wayside.  Things like, oh, travel arrangements.  I can't wait for our little meeting today.  Yeah, it'll be fun.  Yeah, congratulations.  Well, it's the number one satellite radio company by far.  The little doggy company is way, way behind, and they're the kings of press releases.  They like to throw press releases out to everyone, making believe they're doing better than they  really are. 
[00:12:00]  They stink.  They absolutely stink.  Was that from a press release?  Don't buy the hype.  We stink.  They finally made 1 million, and I don't even think they made a million.  I think they're botching the numbers, to be quite frank with you, because if they didn't  hit 1 million, they'd be in deep trouble on Wall Street.  Because they said they would hit a million by the end of the year, so a couple of days before  the end of the year, they announce it.  But yeah, what was done as far as number juggling?  Was anything done?  I would think something had to be done, yes. 
[00:12:30]  Of course, Anthony.  But the lead is growing.  I mean, they are getting further and further and further behind.  So don't believe what you're reading, man.  I mean, this is the number one company, and it's getting more gooder every day.  Our show's getting more gooder.  Satellite Radio's getting more gooder.  XM Satellite Radio in general's getting more gooder.  Yes.  Right?  More gooder.  More gooder.  There you have it.  What's up, Jimmy?  Hi.  How are you today?  I'm still trying to get used to this, man.  Just getting two hours a night. 
[00:13:00]  I'm laying in bed with my stuffy nose, just not breathing and not sleeping.  I'm in bed by 12.  Are you going to blame it on your nose or that hot piece of ass that was walking around  here yesterday?  Two hours sleep.  She may have something to do with it.  All right.  Jesus.  It looked like a child.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We rode down in the elevator after the show yesterday, and she's talking about something,  and her braces are just glittering in the elevator light.  Yeah.  Just full of life.  Hey, why didn't you cut a big nasty fart in the elevator when she was in there yesterday, 
[00:13:30]  Jimmy?  Why didn't you do that like you do any time you're in the elevator with me and Opie?  I would have.  No, you wouldn't.  Sure, you would have.  Sure.  You're such a liar.  Nothing kills the mood of a girl like a gasser.  You never drop one in front of a girl, ever.  Well, she killed the mood of the show yesterday, too, because we were flowing and all of a sudden  this, do you mind if I call her a piece of ass?  All right.  This piece of ass is walking around outside the studio with a little backpack and tiny little  waist.  She's like, I don't know, 5'9".  That's 5'8". 
[00:14:00]  I think she had the shoes on.  Yeah, it's really, really hot.  And an ass like a 10-year-old boy.  Yes.  We couldn't believe she was here for Jimmy.  No offense, Jimmy.  No, that's all right.  And we got to the bottom of it.  It turns out she is of age, Anthony.  Yeah.  But the creepy thing about it is Norton admits this morning that he's known her for three  years.  Yeah.  Since she was 18.  Since she was 18.  Yeah.  Maybe less than three years.  I don't deal with underage girls.  No, I know.  It's more of a joke.  Too much trouble.  Yeah.  Disposing of.  So you're going to blame the lack of sleep on your nose and not define the young lady. 
[00:14:30]  Yeah, it's more than always.  I wish I had better stories for you.  She's staying at the Chateau Norton?  Yeah.  As a friend.  If somebody's in from out of town and they're like, look, where am I going to stay?  Yeah, come on.  Stay over.  Come on.  Stay over.  Why not?  Absolutely.  Stay at some nice hotel where they have room service and stuff.  Do you make them earn their keep?  Dude, just the fact that they walk down the street with me and that's pretty much earning  their keep.  Yeah.  If I can walk into the cellar with a hot chick, I'm very happy. 
[00:15:00]  But I'm trying not to take a dump while she's there.  So I keep putting the shower on.  She didn't notice I took four showers yesterday.  Oh, yeah.  That might strike her as odd.  Yeah.  You know?  A couple of nice logs.  But how do you get rid of the smell?  You just got to leave the shower thing running and a couple of matches will do it.  And you're set, you think?  There's so much.  You have no window in the bathroom?  You could have invited Ben over to open it up.  I do actually have a window right in my shower.  You can look out.  Oh, well, there you go.  That's all you need to do.  Take the towel. 
[00:15:30]  Whoosh.  Whoosh.  Kind of fan it out the window.  Do I remember?  Oh, yeah.  I remember one time I went to upstate New York with this girl who was visiting from Vegas.  When I lived in Jersey.  And I was torn with dice at the time.  So she thought I made a lot of money.  She didn't realize I lived with mold on my walls.  And I took her to upstate New York.  I was doing a college seven-hour drive.  And the minute she was miserable because she thought I was like this rich guy.  And she's in my old Saturn.  You bamboozled her.  I never lied to her.  I didn't think she knew that until I realized the guy she likes.  You know, her friend that she lives with is like a millionaire.  And then she got drunk as soon as we got to my apartment in Jersey. 
[00:16:00]  She wanted vodka.  I'm like, oh, all right.  So we go to upstate New York.  And the first thing I do is go to the bathroom and take one of those eight-decibel shits in like a little echoey room.  There's nothing worse than a chick being in the next room.  You know, you're trying to like.  I didn't know she's hearing it.  Oh, she can't not.  It's like.  I'd rather have gas panes than let something like that fly in front of anyone.  You try to turn the water on.  It's just not loud enough.  It was awful.  So, yeah, I was trying to avoid that. 
[00:16:30]  You start humming and trying to sing a song.  Yeah, coughing.  Right.  Dude, I'm a professional.  I turn the TV up louder before I know I'm going in.  Oh, you got to set it up.  Yeah.  So I can hear the news like that.  And then I just kind of go in and do what I got to do.  Let her rip.  That really is funny.  So is she over in your apartment right now?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Alone?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I trust her.  Yeah.  Dude, I have a box of porn that I had to put in my basement.  Yeah, what kind of prep did you do knowing that you were going to have a guest?  Had the apartment cleaned?  I mean, you know, it wasn't that dirty.  It was just messy. 
[00:17:00]  And a couple of things like, you know, your pornography collection.  Have you ever been to Norton's new place?  I've never seen Norton's place.  You got to let everyone know he's got a really nice place.  And it's decorated quite nicely.  Well, I knew when he was talking about picking up a duvet a while back that he would have a nice place.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Well, I put little rocks.  Oh, people would really laugh.  Little rocks?  Yeah, like little rocks with candles along the floor at some place.  I'm going to steal that, by the way.  Oh, brother.  I'm going to steal that idea, by the way.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  Rocks and candles? 
[00:17:30]  I got to admit, it's kind of nice.  Where is it?  From the bathroom to your bedroom, kind of?  Well, no, it's along the wall.  You make a right in my front door to make a right to go past my bathroom and bedroom.  So there's a little hallway there, but there's nothing you can put there because it's closet space.  Where did you get that idea?  You did not think of it yourself.  Don't even tell me.  I did.  There's nothing along the lower walls.  I'm like, yeah, put some of the candles.  I love the candles smell good because when I quit smoking, so I love that smell of candles.  Yeah, I know, but most people put the candles up on a table or something or on a shelf or, you know.  What inspired you to put little rocks and candles in your hallway? 
[00:18:00]  I just saw, I don't know.  I might have been in, like, you know, the Pottery Barn or one of those other catch the virus as soon as you walk in.  I'm the worst.  You are a little faggot.  Girls like it, though.  They like it.  When they come in, it smells nice.  They're like, oh, it's so nice.  You know, the chicks dig that.  You know, I don't care if guys like it.  Patrice and Keith are over.  I just think he wants a rock available at any given moment to clobber some girl over their head.  They're little pebbles, Dad.  Are they little rocks?  They're cute, smooth pebbles.  Like a big fist-sized rock you're going to wail someone over the noggin with? 
[00:18:30]  He's not going to get any damage done with these little smooth pebbles.  Unless I can get rid of the swallowment.  It looks like time and water, you know, had worked on these rocks for, like, a million years.  Where did you get the rocks?  On Houston, I think, in Pottery Barn.  You bought them at a little place?  Oh, yeah.  A little bag of rocks.  And they're just spread out nice against the wall, and then in the middle is candles that he lights.  You little faggot.  I really have a little mall with, like, candles.  A little interior decorator guy.  Dude, you've got to see his OCD.  You were joking about my OCD today. 
[00:19:00]  You were joking about Bernie Getz's OCD before the show today.  Norton's pretty bad, too.  I once hung out.  I once came over, and we were going to go eat or whatever, and we spent, come on, and  you've got to be honest, 20 to 30 minutes trying to line up his Richard Pryor photo perfectly  with the other pictures on the wall.  Really?  Yeah.  Dude, it was so annoying.  And then he has, what do you have framed by Richard Pryor?  You have something framed?  No, the one thing that's in your living room.  It's a check or something?  Oh, yeah.  I don't have that up anymore.  Something that was framed, okay, a Richard Pryor thing, but he had to put it in the frame 
[00:19:30]  himself and mounted nice, and then he was worried that whatever it was in the frame  wasn't lined up perfectly with the actual frame, so he had to rework that, and then it  wasn't hanging right on the wall.  Dude, it took forever for us to get out of the apartment so we could go eat.  It was, I forgot I had that, it's a check by Richard Pryor, he did the Mod Squad, it's  one of his residual checks that he never cashed, so I bought it on eBay.  It's like, I checked two Richard Pryor for 22 bucks or whatever, but it's really his.  It's really his?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  It's really, they should like the FICA and all that crap. 
[00:20:00]  That's kind of cool.  Oh, dude, I love eBay.  How much, if I may ask?  Oh, no, probably 60 bucks, 50 bucks.  It wasn't like a tremendous amount of money.  Not bad?  Yeah, double the check or something.  It wasn't so awful.  I was going to call you last night.  Did you watch The Insider?  Uh-uh.  Speaking of Pryor?  Uh-uh.  Dude, his body is ravaged.  He is completely done.  He's in a wheelchair.  He's not moving much at all.  It's MS, and they swear that his mind is completely there, but his body's gone. 
[00:20:30]  His mouth is open pretty much the whole time, and he's drooling.  It is so awful to look at.  Could he talk at all or no?  He was like, Pat O'Brien is asking him questions.  He's just like, eh, eh.  That's about all he can muster, man.  It was just awful to see.  Because you know what the guy used to be like, you know?  Yeah.  That's something.  Wow.  I guess they took a...  I think they're making a movie of his life or something.  I'm not sure.  Yeah, I heard that. 
[00:21:00]  I heard Eddie Griffin was supposed to play him.  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  So he went on the set to check it out.  Can't we get a white guy to play him?  What?  That's true, like the Honey Motors.  Wouldn't that be good?  Yeah.  There's so many movies being redone and characters being remade that now star black guys.  I figured if we could get a white guy to play Richard Pryor.  Come on.  No?  Well, yeah, I don't think that would take off.  But the footage was just awful.  Absolutely awful.  I was going to tape it, but he didn't say anything at all.  It was just, eh.  A little visual, huh?  Yeah.  It was just an awful visual.  One of the worst visuals I've seen. 
[00:21:30]  It is awful.  It's sad to see him like that.  I watched a tribute they did to him at Kennedy Center like seven, eight years ago, and the  camera stayed like 40 yards away from him while he was up in the balcony.  People were giving a tribute to him.  It was really awful.  Life just stinks.  It's awful.  Time is really a drag.  Time's a bitch.  Life's a bitch.  People put their faith in some ultimate being, and he's just not paying attention to anybody.  Oh, let me just wash away 25,000, 50,000 people. 
[00:22:00]  Here you go.  Yeah, the tsunami's up to what?  25,000 people dead?  Oh, 25,000 people in the tsunami.  Oh, yeah.  Well.  Yeah.  That's wonderful.  I just love the news because it's like 25,000 dead because of the tsunami, and in our area,  a bunch of people were stranded for Christmas.  What a drag for those people.  No eggnog, no presents.  The news is just amazing.  They pretty much put both stories on an equal platform.  Yeah.  25,000 dead.  It's going to be at least 50 when it's all said and done. 
[00:22:30]  Yep.  And the next story is about holiday travelers that were stuck in an airport, and what a  drag it must have been for them.  Yeah.  No eggnog this Christmas.  Yeah, what's the quote?  I wrote it down.  Yeah, no eggnog, no tree, no presents for some unlucky passengers.  And this was reported right after the tsunami story.  Yeah, put it right next to the picture in the paper with the woman and her dead baby.  Yeah.  That's good.  And in other bad news, us New Yorkers had to deal with an inch of snow yesterday. 
[00:23:00]  Oh, real rough.  Right.  I was watching Fox News yesterday when I got home, and they were doing a whole thing on  the tsunami, and it was under the guise of caring.  You know when 9-11 happened, they'd show photos of people and do a montage when they went into  commercials, and you'd see photos of people running or crying or looking up, all haggard  and stuff, and they'd play some really somber music. 
[00:23:30]  They were doing that yesterday for the tsunami victims.  But you just knew it's Fox News, so it's just all sensationalism, and trying to get people  to tune in longer.  So they kept playing the clips over and over of the waves washing over, and the water rushing  up the street, and seeing people being washed away.  And it was under this guise that they care.  And they're just showing this to show how we have to help and care.  And it's Fox News. 
[00:24:00]  You know they're just full of crap.  Yeah, they love this stuff.  They don't care.  They know, because all I was tuning in for, I'm sorry, I want to see a new angle.  I saw a new one.  I saw the people up by the swimming pool.  Did you see that?  Oh, yeah, I did.  Where the water just rushes into the pool and keeps rising.  I can't get enough watching that water just going everywhere.  Don't kid yourself.  If Fox could get away with it, they would be playing the Beach Boys music as the footage  is on TV.  Catch a wave, and you're sitting on top of the world. 
[00:24:30]  Oh, awful.  Of course they would, man.  It would be funny.  What an hippie life.  That's horrible.  And I am sure that, you know what, surfing Sri Lanka.  You know what, everybody's got to surf.  I'm telling you, they would do that.  Matter of fact, you know my buddy, Buzzy?  Yes.  Old college roommate, and, you know, old fraternity brother and all that.  He's been in the news business since college, so for a long time. 
[00:25:00]  These guys are twisted in the editing rooms.  Oh, they've seen it all.  They will take footage of the tsunami, and they'll throw some, you know, Beach Boys music  on and make some wacky video.  And then it's passed around underground.  Yeah.  To other TV stations.  No, they don't care.  They're desensitized to it.  All of them are.  What was the one I showed you?  The Bud Dwyer footage.  And they put it to a rap song.  Yeah.  It was really awful.  And that was making the underground for a really long time. 
[00:25:30]  They made it go backwards and forwards.  Right to the beat of a rap song?  Right when he pulls the trigger.  He's the guy in, I guess, Philly that shot himself in the head at a press conference,  and it was caught live on video, and the back of his head just pretty much blows out,  and you see the top of his head and hair fly up for a little bit, and they played it  backwards and forward to some rap music.  So the top of his head looked like it was going, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, like flapping  up and then back down again. 
[00:26:00]  And it looked like he was doing some wacky dance with his hair and head flying up.  Yeah.  Really twisted.  And, yeah, Buzzy was just all excited about this and laughing and going, oh, you've got  to see this.  This isn't funny at all.  You guys in that newsroom, you know, you've got a whole different plane of funny.  Yeah, it's just amazing, the videos that Buzzy has.  We talked about some of them.  Yeah, the almost snuff film.  Right.  Well, then, before they were able to show dead bodies on TV, you know, 10 years ago, they 
[00:26:30]  really weren't showing dead bodies, especially American dead bodies on TV.  They just weren't.  And so, but all these news crews would go to the horrific motorcycle accident or the  suicide or what have you, and they would still, you know, film all that stuff.  Yeah.  And they would put, you know, montages together for people that were in the news business.  Yeah.  And these things were being traded like crazy.  And that's sick.  They're like, almost like snuff films.  Right.  And you just see, like, now they showed on the news, though, so it's no big deal anymore.  Last night, I don't know.  How many dead people did you see last night on the news? 
[00:27:00]  Hundreds.  And it's sick.  Thousands, maybe.  You're looking at a bunch of dead people.  Yeah.  We've become pretty desensitized, I think, because that used to be a pretty big deal when  you would see it on TV.  It would be, it would, it's disturbing and stuff, but think of what it takes to really  disturb people to the point where they won't watch it anymore, like the beheading videos.  I can't watch those.  I won't watch them.  But years ago, I wouldn't even want to see a dead body on TV.  No, now it's, you know, it's, now it's, now it's, now it's, now it's getting, uh, pretty  common. 
[00:27:30]  But we're also, wreck of the day.  There's a wreck of the day, huh?  Oh, that's brutal.  Looks like somebody was, uh, hitting the side and a car is, looks like an ambulance.  Yeah, that's an ambulance.  Laying on its side.  On its side.  Nice.  There you go.  That's our wreck of the day.  Every morning there's a wreck of the day.  But we become more desensitized to things like, you know, seeing dead bodies on TV.  They used to just maybe show a leg or, or something or a hand and you know it was dead.  Yeah, that hand.  Usually it would be a dead body with a sheet, but the hand would be sticking out. 
[00:28:00]  Right, right.  They'd show the hand.  That's, yeah, to show, yeah, there is a dead body under this guy.  That was creepy.  Last night, I'm seeing just a panning, they were panning a line, uh, a pile of dead  people and just full faces, mouths open.  Some of their mouths are taped shut for some reason.  They're keeping, you know, things from going in there, I guess.  They had, uh, pictures or notes written that were laying on their chests or stomachs being  held down with rocks.  Mm-hmm. 
[00:28:30]  And they're just panning this line like, you know, like it's just a line of parade goers  or something, you know.  And, uh, I'm watching it going, wow.  Yeah.  We see a lot of dead people on a daily basis these days.  And once again, where is the outrage?  Where is the outrage by these-  It's not a breast.  It's okay.  By these stupid people that had a problem with the Janet Jackson breast that was on TV  for less than a second.  Where is the outrage of seeing dead babies on TV?  I think, you know, I, I, my, my stance is simple.  I think you should show all of it on TV. 
[00:29:00]  Sure.  Absolutely all of it.  But if you're going to make some decisions, you're going to try to tell me that a Janet Jackson  breast for less than a second is worse than seeing dead babies?  Any breast.  I would-  Or dead people in general?  Breasts make people, uh, happy.  Have you ever noticed that?  Have you ever noticed how a room full of people just get happier when they, they see breasts,  whether they're live or on video or something?  There's a calming, there's a calming feeling that comes over here.  All of a sudden, all of a sudden you're, you're in a bad mood.  You see a breast and you just go, ah, ah, look, breasts. 
[00:29:30]  Ah.  All of a sudden you just have a, ah, ah, ah, it's a breast.  Well, for some reason, uh, that's a problem on television.  Dead people, fine.  Dead babies.  I've seen dead babies yesterday.  I don't think it's, I don't think you get that calming feeling coming over you when you  see a dead baby on TV.  Unless you're Jim Norton.  Speak for yourself.  But, uh, you know, you see nudity, breasts, things like that.  Something of a sexual nature.  Yeah. 
[00:30:00]  That's fine.  But for some reason, especially in this country, we just go animal.  People freak out.  Religious groups go nuts when there's nudity or some type of adult oriented language or,  or subject matter being discussed.  But show all the death and destruction you can.  And, uh, for some reason that's fine.  And we, we accept it and we just live with it.  I don't know.  This show.  There's Ben's yawn in the morning. 
[00:30:30]  Oh, Ben.  Jesus Christ.  Oh, oh, let me get one out, Ben.  Oh, let's all.  It really is this morning.  Oh.  You have no idea you just yawn all morning, do you?  Dude, first of all, I yawned.  I didn't yawn after the first hour yesterday.  I haven't got all my coffee in me yet.  Oh, wait a minute.  Oh, that's really.  It's not like I'm tired.  I slept plenty last night.  I know.  But you don't understand.  No, it's not that big a deal.  You know that Anthony and I and Norton, we're trying to entertain the entire nation right 
[00:31:00]  now.  And to, to hear our producer in the background yawning, it's kind of disheartening.  Do you understand that at all?  On any level?  He's sleepy.  I'm not sleepy.  I'm not sleepy at all.  That's like watching Tony Danza and the extravadanza, and he's working his ass off, and they pan to  the crowd, and they're asleep and yawning.  It's a buzzkill.  Unfortunately, Ben, I think boredom and being tired has the same human reaction, the yawn. 
[00:31:30]  So perhaps Ben is a little sleepy, and he's yawning, but it comes off like, you know,  Oh, shut up.  Yeah, like, oh, I can't be bothered with this crap.  But perhaps you're just sleepy.  When are they going to talk about the Red Sox or you two?  Then I'll wake up.  Could you imagine if the Sox signed Bono?  That would be perfect.  That would be perfect for everybody.  That would be the best day of my life.  See, now he's laughing instead of yawning.  All right, more Boston references, and we'll keep you awake. 
[00:32:00]  Dude, Tsunami is a Dominican sidebar in Red Sox.  Could you imagine if a tsunami happened in Boston?  It's crazy as nuts.  My hair would actually look neater.  Well, all right.  They're showing all the local angles and stuff with the tsunami story.  I've seen the supermodel there.  What else is her name?  She was a Victoria's Secret swimsuit model.  Very hot.  I call her hot piece of ass.  She is pretty hot.  I believe she's staying over Jimmy Norton's house. 
[00:32:30]  Oh, shit.  Petra Nemkova, her boyfriend got swept out to sea.  Yeah, and her boyfriend, they were in some bungalow.  They're hanging out.  Like, you think of a lot of people were at the beach or something,  and this thing swept over you.  But they're just hanging out in a bungalow.  Not even aware of anything happening.  All of a sudden, through the windows and the door and everything,  water just comes pouring in, sweeps you right out of whatever other opening there is,  and she's clinging onto a tree for eight hours. 
[00:33:00]  With a broken pelvis.  Yeah, with a broken pelvis, all beat up, and her boyfriend apparently just got swept away,  and that's it.  Goodbye.  One of the piles left afterwards.  What a thing to happen.  Dude, you're with your model girlfriend in this great resort.  Oh, in paradise.  You know, one second, you're like,  next thing, you're just sucked underwater, and you're dead.  Imagine that.  The guy who's going down on her just,  hull, hull, you get hit, and wow, she really can come.  Yeah.  She's one of those squirters.  Boy, this just doesn't stop.  I've got to call O&A. 
[00:33:30]  It smells the same, of course.  Oh.  Sorry.  Oh.  Yeah, I need some yawns in my instant replay when we're,  instead of using this one, which is played out.  I like that one, though.  Yeah.  Different instances, too.  Well, you know.  That one can completely be justified.  Yeah.  The yawn, you know, you should always keep your yawns to yourself.  Yeah, we'll have Ben record some yawns when we're really sucking,  then we can play the yawns. 
[00:34:00]  So then we can maybe wake up and move on to another topic.  Anthony, we mentioned this yesterday.  New York might face watery end.  Oh, no, we talk about this because the stupid news insists on putting the local spin on any news story.  9-11, they were like, could it happen in New York?  Oh, I guess it did.  Ha ha.  No?  Crickets?  Anything?  Ha ha.  Ah, asshole.  The news always does this.  So with the tsunami now, they're saying, hey, you know, New York, vulnerable to a tsunami. 
[00:34:30]  Yeah, and they got a picture of the Statue of Liberty water up to her armpits from the movie.  Yeah, this scene from the day after tomorrow could happen.  Shut up.  One of our idiot listeners, he literally just moved his family to the mountains of Pennsylvania  because he's convinced that this will happen.  That the tsunami's coming?  And it's going to happen sooner than we think.  So he's moved his entire family to some, like, mountain or really large hill in Pennsylvania. 
[00:35:00]  I'm convinced any natural disaster that happens in the United States will kill a few hundred people.  The worst one possible would probably claim a few hundred.  You know, the hurricanes and stuff, they do that.  But we're at the point now where we get pretty ample warning for anything.  I believe if this odd earthquake happened in the middle of the Atlantic, we would have some time.  Well, they're saying we would have up to 12 hours, it looks like. 
[00:35:30]  Yeah, there you go.  New York might face watery end.  It hardly raised a ripple when it was reported over the summer.  But news that a tsunami could one day hit New York is suddenly getting a second look, Anthony.  Oh, does this city need a tsunami?  Tsunami, please, you don't understand how much it would be, how easier it would be to drive  if some of these people were just swept away out to sea.  Well, I think it's about time that the herd is thinned.  Oh, tsunami.  Imagine watching those, ugh, disgusting pain-in-the-ass pedestrians just all, ah, screaming, being swept away into the rivers. 
[00:36:00]  Swept down 57th Street.  Oh, I would love it.  Several months ago, geologists raised concerns that an unstable flank of a volcano in the Canary Islands  off the coast of Western Africa could slide into the sea and send giant waves across the Atlantic  at the speed of a jumbo jet, Anthony.  Within three hours, the wave could swamp the west coast of Africa.  This is more fear.  Yeah.  The media loves just scaring the crap out of us.  Within five hours, it could hit southern England. 
[00:36:30]  And within 12 hours, it could build up enough force to wipe out the U.S. east coast,  including New York, Washington, Boston, and Miami.  Hey, no, not Boston.  We're having such a good year.  Eventually, the whole rock will collapse into the water, and the collapse will devastate  the Atlantic margin.  We need to be out there now looking at when an eruption is likely to happen.  Otherwise, there will be no time to evacuate major cities.  Shut up.  There you go.  Isn't that pretty far for a tsunami?  Isn't that pretty far? 
[00:37:00]  I understand.  You know, they're talking, this last tsunami, it was a nine, and it was pretty close to  the coast.  You know, it wasn't like thousands of miles away.  And isn't that the largest earthquake recorded in the last, what, 50 years?  50 years, 40 years, something like that.  Yeah.  They said that what the tsunami does is if you're on the coast, like just hanging out,  the water, I guess it's rushing in, the water, all the water gets drained out from  where you are.  I learned that, like on the Discovery Channel, years ago, you would think if you're hanging 
[00:37:30]  out on the beach and you see the water just being sucked out.  The ocean leaving.  Yeah.  If the ocean's leaving, maybe you should, too.  Do something.  Get out of there.  Don't rush down to look, you idiots.  Pick up some shells.  Oh, look, some shells.  They're exposed now.  Yeah.  And then they said, yeah, the water went out and they just saw a bunch of people and  boats coming toward the shore riding like this wave in and tried to make a break for 
[00:38:00]  it then, but that thing is traveling pretty quick.  And you know what?  They still don't have the videotape of this.  No, they're saying they're like meeting tourists that are coming back.  These news agencies are hanging out at the airports now, meeting tourists, asking them  if they have videotape because they're looking for the money shot, which is the,  definitive shot.  We've seen the one of the water coming up through that building and then up the street.  The guy that doesn't speak English just yapping on the rooftop.  I saw the other one with the pool today.  And then there's a couple of other ones, but not that definitive, oh, my God, here comes 
[00:38:30]  the wall of water, Poseidon Adventure shot.  Exactly.  Well, you know they have it.  Someone's got it.  It's just a matter of time.  I imagine later on today there's going to be just some amazing video.  And the death toll will be well over 50,000 when it's all said and done.  All right.  You want to hit some phone calls real fast?  Sure.  You know, a lot of people hung up because they couldn't wait any longer, but it seems  like a lot of people got their XM satellite radios for Christmas and they want to say  hi.  They're old listeners that I guess were waiting for mommy and daddy to buy a satellite radio 
[00:39:00]  for them.  Cheap bastard.  Like hardcore listeners that are, there's the, yeah, there's the one.  Oh.  Oh.  Is that the one you were talking about?  The wall of water?  That's a different one, no?  That looks old.  Whoa.  Wow.  That's a good one.  Eight Americans?  Boy, is that just a mess.  See how, we're just a bunch of asses in this country.  There's what, 25,000 to 30,000 officially dead right now and it's going to rise?  The news just said eight Americans dead. 
[00:39:30]  Eight Americans.  Wow.  Eight.  Eight Americans equals 30,000 light brown people that don't speak our language.  Well, considering the fact it doesn't affect us, I mean, how come no one's complaining  that the U.S. is meddling?  Where's all the people complaining that the U.S. should stay out and stop interfering  for giving $15 million, no one minds?  And then the U.N. is calling us chintzy and cheap.  Are they really?  Yeah.  You know what?  I have to be honest.  When I heard that figure this morning when I was waking up that our relief was $15 million 
[00:40:00]  to them, I'm like, that's a little cheap.  $15 million is a little cheap, but you've got $15 million.  What's it going to take to rebuild?  Come on.  How about all the money Kofi Annan's son has been skimming?  Maybe he can pass it a few dollars.  Yeah.  Tell your son to cough up some money, that thieving chiseler.  Oh, chiseler.  I thought you were going somewhere else.  Chiseler.  All right.  Let's go to Justin in Baltimore.  Hey, Justin.  What's up?  Hey.  How you doing?  Good.  What do you got?  I've been listening to some talk shows on XM. 
[00:40:30]  Yeah.  And a lot of times I hear them saying somebody's calling in from Virginia on AM something, which  is a commercial band.  Why the hell am I paying $10 a month to hear something I can hear free?  No more question.  Let's see.  Justin, you're insane.  What radio show?  There's a couple radio shows that, yeah, they picked up that are doing commercial radio,  but in general, you're paying that much money for all the music channels and all the other 
[00:41:00]  programming you can't get on regular radio.  Excuse me, Justin?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Justin, you have a TV?  Yeah.  You pay for cable, right?  Uh-huh.  And you get Channel 2, 4, or whatever, your NBC, ABC, Fox affiliates.  You get those, right?  Yeah, all the basic stuff.  Do you know if you just put an antenna on your TV, you can get those for free?  Are you pissed off at your cable company that, along with HBO and stuff, they put those  free stations on? 
[00:41:30]  Are you understanding where I'm getting at, Justin?  I understand.  You've got to look at this in the context of cable television.  And, Justin, you're listening to the O.P. and Anthony program, right?  Yes.  Well, you can't get us on commercial radio where you live.  We're like the Sopranos.  Had that thing going up in New York.  I heard you guys were trying to go commercial up there.  No, not really.  Are you digging for something to maybe?  God damn it!  Are you fucking with me?  I think he's trying.  Like, you're digging for something, and then you're going to strike and try to, like, bash 
[00:42:00]  us in some way, shape, or form?  Oh, no.  This is my first time calling.  Yeah, and a really bad call at that.  Awful.  You get a D-plus on your phone call.  Try calling back again at some other point with something we can work with.  Right.  I'll try better.  All right, Justin.  You gave us nothing.  Bye.  Dominic on Long Island.  What's up?  Hey, guys.  How are you?  Hey, yeah.  Oh, man.  Oh, trick of fodders.  I'm freaking out over the fact that I finally got you guys. 
[00:42:30]  My wife got me it for Christmas.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Merry Christmas.  I told you.  There's so many people that got the XM for Christmas, which is great.  Do you know what you've missed in the last three months on this radio program?  You know what?  I saw it.  I went to it.  I got the news that you guys were coming to XM, and I told my wife, and, you know, yeah,  a little light in the pockets and everything.  I just got a house.  And let me tell you guys, man, I'm so glad that I finally got to hear you guys.  Oh, cool.  You have no idea, man.  This show is so much better than the old show. 
[00:43:00]  I don't know what it is.  More gooder.  It's definitely more gooder.  It's more gooder.  Yeah, yeah, more gooder.  Much more gooder.  Well, we're glad to have you aboard as a listener once again.  I'm trying to get all the guys where I work to get it, you know, because I told one of  the guys yesterday that it's unbelievable.  I caught the Virgin, which he takes it in the air for something, the little fish you guys  do.  Oh, the technical Virgin.  Yeah, we love that.  The technical Virgin.  Yeah, there's another one of those that I'll play going into break. 
[00:43:30]  I got to find it, though.  All right.  Thanks, buddy.  All right.  Take care.  Bye.  Bye, fella.  You like that, see?  Getting it for Christmas.  Yep.  Now, we got to talk to Brett in PA.  This is a very interesting thing.  Go ahead, Brett.  Yeah.  I actually first saw you guys on the McEnroe show.  He took it down a notch.  I'm sorry.  I didn't know George Carlin was calling today after his Vicodin and wine binge. 
[00:44:00]  Well, I'd heard about you guys in the news, and then I actually saw you on that gay-ass  John McEnroe show by 100% chance.  Yeah.  So I looked you up on the internet, and sure enough, your download's all over the place.  People are uploading your show all over.  Yeah, we like the piracy.  Well, a lot of people are listening to the show for free, which is a little dangerous because  if we don't get enough people listening to this show, we're going to be out of business.  So it's a tough little thing that we're dealing with.  We don't want to be the Lars of satellite radio, but some of you guys got to pay for this damn 
[00:44:30]  thing.  Yeah, it's true, but I just fucking, this Christmas, I got an XM, and I signed up for you guys  right away.  All right.  So I think what you're trying to say is you were listening to the show for free for a  while, but then you got the XM satellite radio?  Yep.  I was downloading you guys.  I listened to you for about a month, and that was it.  I was in psyched, and I just, I had to keep listening.  Nice.  All right.  You guys have the best senses of humor.  I fucking love you, Jimmy.  You're a fucking great comment.  Oh, thank you very much, man.  You guys are just fucking awesome, and totally worth the money. 
[00:45:00]  All right.  Look at that.  Thanks, buddy.  Thank you.  All right.  See you later.  All right.  We needed a little anal smooching this morning.  We did?  Yeah, sure.  I like it every so often.  Yeah, that was a...  Every so often, get a little rectal.  It was nice.  All right.  Lady Di, what's up?  Hey, guys.  What's going on with you guys?  What are you doing?  Hold on one second.  Somebody wants to talk to you. 
[00:45:30]  Hold on.  Everybody.  Yeah.  Everybody.  Yeah.  Let's get into it.  What's up?  It's stupid.  Get retarded.  What's happening, brother?  Get retarded.  Hello.  Get retarded.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Let's get retarded.  Yeah.  Let's get retarded.  Yeah.  I can't hear you good.  You can't hear us good.  Let's get retarded here.  Hey.  Hey.  Yeah.  Your lady dies, friend.  What's going on?  Yeah.  I'm renting a room here.  All right.  So what's the deal? 
[00:46:00]  Why are we talking to you on our radio program?  I don't know.  She's handing me the phone.  All right.  Are you guys drinking tonight?  Oh, yeah.  Have you been up all night?  Oh, yeah.  And what's the poison tonight?  What are you drinking?  What's the poison?  Well, her poison is wine.  Yeah.  So she's a wino.  Right.  And what are you drinking?  Oh, she went for a job interview.  Oh, she did?  Yeah.  She's like, I got her ass out in the snow.  Well, are you living there for free? 
[00:46:30]  No.  No?  I'm moving.  I'm out of here.  I'm third.  Are you guys friends?  Going to Bayville.  Are you guys friends?  How'd you meet?  What's that?  How did you guys meet?  How did we meet?  Through a friend.  Yeah.  And you needed a place to stay and Lady Di is...  Yeah.  Just until I got to go back down the shore and my son's in trouble with the law.  So I'm going down there for him.  What a great bunch of people Di is hanging out with.  Yeah.  Wait.  What did your son do?  What did he do?  No.  What did he do that he's in trouble with the law? 
[00:47:00]  I don't know.  You don't know yet?  I'll find out when I get there.  All right.  So be honest with us.  How many days a week does Lady Di drink?  How many days does she drink?  Yeah.  Every day.  Every day, right?  Yeah.  She's been BSing us for a long time.  For the new listeners out there, Lady Di is the one half of the retard Laverne Shirley.  And Anthony and I are convinced that she's going to die of alcohol poisoning.  Well, she will.  Sooner than later.  I tried to stop her.  She's a complete mess. 
[00:47:30]  In the two years that we had off...  No, she's all right.  She gets together every once in a while.  No, she looks like throw mama from the train.  She's looking awful.  You can tell that the liver's starting to fail a little bit because...  She's starting to turn yellow.  Well, see?  There you go.  She is turning some weird colors.  She doesn't look healthy.  She's bloated.  And you're telling me she drinks a lot every night of the week?  Every day.  All day long?  24 hours on Christmas.  She drank for 24 hours on Christmas?  Oh, yeah. 
[00:48:00]  The cops were here.  Why did the cops show up?  Because I wouldn't give her any more wine.  And she called the cops?  Oh, yeah.  Are you kidding me?  Oh, my God.  Imagine that scene.  No, I had to leave for four hours.  What?  I had to leave for four hours.  You had to leave the house?  Were you both drunk?  Man, that must have been a scene right out of cops.  Oh, I love it.  No, because this bitch won't get...  Fuck you.  Give me my wine.  All right.  You're going to have to leave.  Exactly.  Wow.  That's exactly what happened. 
[00:48:30]  See, I knew it, man.  She's been hiding this.  She's been saying that...  I wouldn't give her no more wine.  She's been saying that she's cut down on her drinking and all that.  She should.  She should.  So what happened to her jaw?  Huh?  We still want to know what happened to her jaw.  Did someone...  I wasn't here for that.  I was on Thanksgiving.  I went over to my friend's sister's house for Thanksgiving.  What did she tell you happened?  She fell on her treadmill.  Yeah.  Do you believe that?  No, she ain't going on no treadmill.  Hey, dude.  Did she ever hit on you? 
[00:49:00]  What's that?  Did she ever hit on you?  I don't know.  She stood in the doorway with her little black panties on.  But it ain't happening.  I got a lot of nice other girlfriends.  Wait.  What were you doing?  And she was trying to be seductive in her black underpants?  Yeah.  I told her, don't make me get sick.  Did she?  Hey.  Come on.  Go in your bedroom and close the door.  Did she have a bra on or none?  Well, that time she did. 
[00:49:30]  Wait.  You seen her boobs?  Oh, yeah.  And?  And I almost threw up.  And this...  And...  I got sick.  I was like, get out of here.  So she wants you to bang her?  No.  Oh, I don't know.  But it ain't gonna happen.  But she shows up in your doorway in her black panties and sometimes topless?  Oh, imagine that.  Oh, yeah.  A little back lit.  Oh, yeah.  When my friend Chris was here.  Hey, sweetie.  She ran there naked.  Wait.  When your friend Chris was there, she ran around naked?  Oh, yeah.  Why?  So you saw her muff?  I saw everything. 
[00:50:00]  I almost chumped.  Does she just...  Really?  Really?  I ain't lying.  Does she try to be seductive?  I ain't making this up.  Hey, dude.  Does she try to be seductive with her Babe Ruth body?  Her Babe Ruth body?  That's good.  That's good.  Oh.  Yeah, she did.  Yeah.  But it ain't happening.  That is really bad.  I'm only right in the room.  I'm going.  I'm going down the shore.  My son's got in trouble with the law, and I'm going back down the shore. 
[00:50:30]  We heard about that.  All right.  Well, sounds like it was a fun Christmas at Lady Di's house.  Where is...  Oh, my God.  Where is...  It was not a fun Christmas.  Put that fat drunk on the phone, please.  The who?  The fat drunk.  All right.  I'll call her.  Hey, fat drunk.  They want you on the phone.  All right, brother.  See you.  Take it easy, my friend.  That guy's kind of funny, man.  He is.  There you go.  You're all right, bro.  I was boiling with that thing.  No, I sat on your ass with that thing.  My roommate. 
[00:51:00]  Lady Di.  What?  Tell us about the problem you had during Christmas.  You see?  Get the hell over here.  Lady Di.  What?  What happened on Christmas?  What happened on Christmas?  Yeah.  Oh, she asked her with a question so she could come up with a lie.  Nothing.  Nothing.  Also, for our new listeners, Lady Di is a compulsive liar.  Right.  She is a compulsive liar.  Lady Di, what happened on Christmas? 
[00:51:30]  What happened on Christmas?  What happened on Christmas?  And he kept on bringing back all these kind of things about everything that went back out of my past and everything like that.  That's right.  You know, whatever.  But I'm going back out there again and getting a job.  Lady Di.  What?  Why were the cops called?  Anthony, what?  Why were the cops called?  Why were the cops called?  Yeah.  The question again.  Yes.  Why were the cops called to your house?  Just tell the truth.  Stop thinking of lies.  All right. 
[00:52:00]  Jimmy?  Yes.  Let me tell you something right now.  What happened?  Let me tell you something.  Just between us.  Okay.  You guys are my friends.  Everything is cool.  Really?  Okay.  All right.  Listen, Lady Di, no offense, but I'm not your friend.  Me and Anton.  Shut up, Bulby.  I'm a radio host that exploits you.  He's being honest.  See what honesty sounds like?  Right.  We're not friends.  I don't call you.  I don't really care what happens to you.  I just want to use you to make good radio.  Let's just keep it on the table here. 
[00:52:30]  He said that.  That's why.  What?  Never mind.  Die.  What happened on Christmas?  Tell us about the cops.  All right.  All right.  Look.  Look.  This is what happened on Christmas time.  Because when cops are showing up on Christmas Day, ouch.  That is white trash as you can get.  Yep.  So what happened?  He hit a box of wine on me in the back porch.  To save it for tomorrow.  To save it for the next day.  Exactly what he said.  Just what he said.  And you got mad because you couldn't get to the wine? 
[00:53:00]  Yeah.  Basically, it's something I paid for.  Now, he hit the box of wine.  You got mad.  So that is why you called what?  The authorities.  You called.  Did you dial 911?  Did you dial 911?  911?  See?  What happened?  No, nothing.  He said he had to freeze his ass off that side because I called the cops on him. 
[00:53:30]  Die.  What?  Die.  Did you call 911?  Yeah, I did.  You stupid bitch.  Hey!  Do you understand what?  I'm a stupid bitch.  Yes, you are.  Do you understand what 911 is for?  911 is not a joke.  It's an emergency number that is used for emergencies.  Oh, please stop laughing.  Not my fucking wine is hidden.  But imagine the cops.  They should have shot you when the police showed up.  They should have shot you. 
[00:54:00]  That's okay.  They should have harpooned you.  That's right.  People will call 911 for the dumbest reasons.  All drunk.  You're a mess.  So what happened?  The cops made your friend find the box of wine so you could drink yourself more into oblivion?  Yeah, they came back over here and they got the box of wine.  That's it.  That was it?  Mm-hmm.  And they made your roommate leave the house?  When I paid for it, that's what happened. 
[00:54:30]  Do you understand now that when you call the police because you can't get your wine that perhaps you have a drinking problem?  Do you think you have a drinking problem?  No.  No.  But you're drunk calling the police because your wine was hidden.  And you don't see that as a drinking problem.  God, are you a mess.  You really have fallen off the deep end. 
[00:55:00]  Yeah, we try to get you help.  This guy, Jim.  Hold on.  Let me...  Jim?  Yeah, hold on.  Uh-oh.  I don't want to talk to him.  Oh, why?  Why don't you want to talk to him?  Why?  I don't want to talk to him.  Because you feel all stupid, don't you?  Why don't you want...  I don't like him.  I don't like him.  Because I gave up on you because I got sick of hearing I don't know.  I don't know if I have a drinking problem.  I don't know if I'm ready to...  Yeah, Jim is in the program and was trying to get Lady Di in the program.  Turn it down.  Turn it down.  Turn it down for a minute, please. 
[00:55:30]  And Jim has given up on Lady Di, right, Jim?  Jim is growing up to the show again.  Yeah, it's ridiculous.  I got to the point where...  Stop it, Jim.  I don't want to hear it from you.  I don't know.  I don't want to hear it from you.  Wow.  What a shame, Di.  Why don't you want to hear it from Jim?  I don't care.  I don't want to hear it from him.  Why?  Because I don't want to hear it from him.  Why?  Because he yells at me all the time.  Well, someone's got to yell at you.  I don't know why.  Maybe you need a yelling at me.  I wonder why, Di, could it be because I'm trying to help you get sober? 
[00:56:00]  Look, let me tell you something right now.  There's a difference between helping me nice and helping me bad.  And you're helping me bad.  Oh, okay.  How's he helping you bad?  Yes, how's he helping you bad?  What's that?  Jimmy, look, look.  What, Dixie, I'm an adult.  How him help you bad?  No, no, no.  Listen to me.  Look, I don't want to listen to him yelling at me.  Maybe you need a yelling at. 
[00:56:30]  Maybe I do.  Maybe a bit more.  I'll give you some good news, Di.  I'll give you some good news.  I'm not going to yell at you anymore.  Like I told you the last time you called.  Don't yell at me.  I don't like that.  Well, Di, like I told you the last time you called me.  I don't want to talk to you at this point.  Tuesday morning.  You decide you're ready.  Then I'll turn around and help you.  There you go.  And Jimmy, by the way, congratulations on being the star of the radio show.  Oh, thank you. 
[00:57:00]  You heard what that yesterday.  Yes.  Wow.  Thanks, buddy.  Everything is fine.  But I don't appreciate being yelled at.  Do you understand that?  Well, you know what, Lady Di?  This was the only person, and we broadcast to a pretty huge audience at this point, that  was willing to help you, and now he's not going to help you.  All right, guys.  I've got to go to work.  I'll talk to you later.  All right, Jim.  There you go.  The only guy that was going to help you is now gone.  But he's yelling a little too much, I guess.  Congratulations.  I've got to go to work.  Now, Di, he would yell at you?  Hello?  I'm right here. 
[00:57:30]  He would yell at you?  Is that what you didn't like?  I don't like that.  Do you understand that?  Why don't you like it?  What do you mean?  I don't like people yelling at me.  Oh, here we go.  No, what are you talking about?  I don't like that.  Well, maybe you need to be yelled at to get it through your thick head.  Why don't you like people yelling at you?  Because I have to do this on my own. 
[00:58:00]  Yeah.  Well, you think you're going to deny you're laughing at me?  Shut up.  You shut up.  You shut up.  You shut up.  You shut up.  Shut up.  Shut the fuck up.  You shut up.  Shut up.  Lady Di, did you get yelled at a lot when you were growing up?  Oh, maybe that's it.  Yes, I did.  You did.  What, put down that Twinkie, things like that? 
[00:58:30]  No.  I was always skinny when I was a girl.  A little girl.  A little girl.  Stop laughing at me.  Stop laughing at me.  Stop laughing at me.  Oh, my God.  Oh, by the way.  By the way.  By the way.  Opie?  Stop laughing at me.  Opie.  Anthony.  Anybody there?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, what?  Madeline played the XM radio for me yesterday. 
[00:59:00]  She played the XM radio for you yesterday?  Yeah, because I went over and around.  What the hell does that mean?  Oh, my God.  So why don't you like people yelling at you?  It brings back memories of your dad yelling at you growing up?  Is that even remotely funny?  I'm asking.  He's asking the question.  We're trying to delve into part of your problem.  Your answer is where the humor lies.  Right.  Did you have a hard time growing up and being yelled at? 
[00:59:30]  Did Daddy yell at you?  Yes, I did.  He wanted a boy, and he got a drunk girl instead.  You know when my birthday was?  When?  April 1st.  Oh, my God.  I knew that was going to happen.  So Daddy yelled at you a lot growing up, huh?  Yeah, he did.  For what?  Everything.  Well, specifically, like what? 
[01:00:00]  Yeah.  Every boyfriend I ever brought home was no good for him.  Right.  Uh-oh.  You know what that means.  Every freaking boyfriend I brought home was not good enough for him.  I think he didn't touch you where the bathing suit covers, did he?  What?  No.  Oh.  All right.  What bathing?  What?  What did you just say?  He didn't touch you where the bathing suit covers, did he?  Daddy didn't touch you inappropriately, did he? 
[01:00:30]  No.  My father?  No.  All right.  So he didn't like the boyfriends that you brought home.  What else?  Even a pedophile wouldn't be that stupid and desperate.  He just did not like the people I brought over.  So what happened?  But that's kind of a normal thing.  You know, a lot of fathers don't think that the guys that the girls bring home are worthy  of their little girl.  I know, Anthony.  Or in your case, huge girl, but, you know.  I wasn't huge back then.  All right.  If you saw pictures of me, I wasn't huge.  What was the problem?  Why was he always shouting at you and berating you? 
[01:01:00]  Yeah.  I have no idea.  No clue.  What would you be doing when he'd yell at you?  Jim, I have no idea.  So now when men yell at you, this harkens back to an earlier day of your father yelling  at you?  I don't know.  And that's why you don't like guys yelling at you?  Oh, believe me.  Well, get used to it!  What?  Who said that, Jim? 
[01:01:30]  No.  Not Anthony, you ass.  Oh.  I don't yell.  Right.  I hit.  Well, all right.  Well, this is...  I guess this is...  I don't know.  I mean, I have no idea.  I guess this is the Lady Di update.  She's still drinking, now seven days a week.  Yeah.  She called the cops on Christmas because her roommate hid the box of wine so she wouldn't  get drunker.  Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.  And that's about it, right, Anthony?  Howie, howie, howie, did you tell them you called the cops on them?  You told them that, right? 
[01:02:00]  You called the cops on them?  No, you called the cops on your...  I called the cops on you.  You told them that, right?  Didn't you?  See?  Uh, see?  Yes, you did.  I'm not a liar.  I go to church every Sunday.  Oh, and I...  I love that guy.  Yeah?  I love that guy.  What?  See what?  See what?  You called the cops on your roommate because he hid your box of wine.  See what?  Yeah, I called the cops.  What?  Oh, my God.  Nothing. 
[01:02:30]  All right, are we done with Lady Di for today?  I have one more question for her.  Yes, go ahead, Jimmy.  Go ahead.  Why will you sometimes stand around in just your black panties?  Oh, that's right, yeah.  Because my robe was downstairs in the cellar.  Getting ready to get washed.  Getting ready to get washed?  What?  It has to just...  Getting ready to get washed.  How does a robe get ready to get washed?  Well, because it has to go in the washer and dryer.  That's why.  Does the robe have to, you know, put its makeup on? 
[01:03:00]  Oh, my goodness.  The robe's got to shake off being on her body.  And do its hair?  Like, how does a robe get ready to get washed?  The robe is curled up behind the...  Can I ask your question?  Just crying.  Yeah, what?  Can I ask ONA a question?  Go ahead.  Probably the robe was hiding in the basement because it didn't want to cover up that awful  body of yours.  Trying to hang itself with its own rope?  Thanks a lot.  No, what's your question?  What's your question?  It was found hanging in your basement.  Shut up, Jim.  I'm sorry.  Shut up, Jim.  Sorry.  Yeah, Jim, you ass. 
[01:03:30]  I don't know what happens.  My blonde hair gets in my eyes.  So, what?  So, you don't have a robe, so you decide I need to walk around in my awful black panties  in front of my roommate that's horrified and said he was going to puke?  You are a disgusting fat body, Private Pile.  Oh, my God.  No.  What is that, Private Pile?  Sir, Jelly Donuts, sir.  He didn't see me naked.  He did not see me naked.  He said he's seen your boobs.  He said he saw you standing in the doorway with your black panties on. 
[01:04:00]  Ask him.  He'll tell us.  Is that supposed to be sexy?  Huh?  So, what if he did?  Were you trying to be sexy?  No, I was not.  Not at all.  Well, if you weren't going for sexy, that was it.  I just went over to the bathroom, you know, to my bedroom, and got changed.  That's it.  You weren't standing seductively in the doorway?  No, I did not, Jim.  With your fine, tan legs?  No, I did not.  And your awful bunt? 
[01:04:30]  My awful bunt.  Yeah, no, I did not.  Do you walk around the apartment with no brassiere?  Sometimes.  What?  Let me, let, all right, let's, all right, dude, try, let's try to make her cry again before  we get her off the air.  I have to shut on.  Yeah, okay.  So what?  We're back.  It's okay.  Does it bother you that he doesn't hit on you at all?  He doesn't hit on me at all.  Does that bother you, I'm saying?  No, it does not, it does not, because we're just friends. 
[01:05:00]  Lady Di.  What?  What was Jim, who was trying desperately to help you with your drinking, what was he doing?  What was he yelling at you about?  About me helping me with my drinking, exactly.  And what would, like he was, what would, what would he yell?  What kind of things would he yell at you?  All right, Jimmy, yell it again, because I have no idea what you're talking about.  What? 
[01:05:30]  I don't know, Opie.  Likewise.  Jim's on the phone, it's just Opie, Anthony, and Ben Sparks.  He would yell at you.  I don't want to talk to Jim.  Jim was very nasty to me.  Why was he nasty to you?  Yeah, how was he nasty?  He was very, very nasty to me.  I don't want to talk to him.  Well, then, then we don't want to talk to you.  Well, why won't you talk to me?  Oh, come on.  Why won't you talk to me?  All right, who am I talking to right now?  Jim.  Where is he?  I'm home. 
[01:06:00]  Jim?  Yeah.  Do me a big favor and talk to me nice if you want to talk to me ever again.  I try to talk to you nice.  Listen, you pig.  He was talking to you nice.  So why don't you like being yelled at?  Lady Di.  What?  Why don't you like being yelled at?  I don't want to be yelled at like this.  Well, the guy's yelling at you to, you know, wake you up because you're drinking yourself to death. 
[01:06:30]  And you can't be spoken to.  You have to be yelled at.  Your head's thick.  There's nothing getting through that unless you yell.  People have to yell at you because you don't listen.  You probably didn't listen to your, you probably didn't listen to your dad either, did you?  Brought home those animals to the house, into his house.  That's why he would yell at you.  How do you know about my father?  Because you just told us, you idiot.  Told us he wasn't happy with the mutants you'd bring home. 
[01:07:00]  Were they colored gentlemen?  What gentleman are you talking about?  The guys you brought home to your dad that didn't approve of you.  I know about the people that my father didn't approve about.  You were a big disappointment to your dad, weren't you?  Oh yeah.  He's a big disappointment to me too.  Hold on a minute.  Let's go back to Jim, the Lady Di's sponsor. 
[01:07:30]  Hey Jim.  Hey Lady Di, when did I ever yell at you?  The only time I yelled at you was when I told you not to call me back.  You did enough to me.  You did enough to me.  Alright?  I don't appreciate anybody yelling at me like you did.  When did I yell at you?  Okay, you know, I mean, I know I have a problem, a little bit of a problem, whatever, whatever, whatever.  But I don't appreciate anybody freaking yelling at me.  You know, guys, you're absolutely right. 
[01:08:00]  She does not ask the questions.  Right, I know.  I asked her straight up.  When did I yell at her?  Right.  You know?  Lady Di, I just think you're coming up with excuses because you don't really want Jim or anyone else to help you.  I can hear you in here.  Okay, listen to me.  Look, look, look.  I just want to say one thing, okay?  I want to say one thing right now.  Hold on one second.  Stop it.  Go on the porch.  Louie's going to kick you out of here. 
[01:08:30]  Wait, who's going to kick you out of there?  My roommate.  My roommate is talking to me right now.  Yeah, why does he want you to go on the porch?  Louie's going to hear you and you're going to be out in the snow.  Look.  Louie's going to hear you and you're going to be kicked out in the snow?  I thought you owned this place.  Yes, I do own the place.  But your roommate is going to kick you out of the house?  No, he's not going to kick me out of the house.  All right.  Well, you know, this is going nowhere.  Yeah.  Did you just say you own the place?  Lady Di, do you own that place? 
[01:09:00]  No, I'm a roommate.  I'm a tenant up here.  Why'd you lie?  You lied.  You are a compulsive liar.  I'm not a compulsive liar.  Why does everybody say I'm a fucking liar?  You're a compulsive liar because you lie about everything.  You lie about everything.  Which is why I called back in to defend myself.  All right.  No, I know you're not the problem, Jim.  Thank you.  All right, guys.  Have a good day.  All right.  Di, you decide you want to get sober, you have my number. 
[01:09:30]  Goodbye.  There you go.  I got you.  All right.  Well, Lady Di, we're done with you today.  What do you got lined up for your day, Di?  Oh, nothing.  I guess I'm just going to, you know, going to do some things out here sometime today.  I have no idea.  Like what?  I have no idea.  Some drinking?  Some more morning drinking?  I have no idea what I'm going to do.  All right.  I have no idea.  All right.  Any last words just in case you die? 
[01:10:00]  I'm not going to die.  Well, it's just a matter of time, so we figured we should get something on tape.  You want to say something to your son or to Marion?  No, no.  My son is still living over with my father right now.  Oh.  All right.  Can you say your mom's box just in case?  You never know.  I'm not going to do that.  Do what?  The son is living with your father who was so disappointed in you?  My father.  And your son is now living there because you're incapable of taking care of him as a mother? 
[01:10:30]  I guess.  Do you want to say that?  All right.  Your life is a mess.  Wow.  Just say your mom's box.  No, I'm not going to say that.  Say what?  My mom passed away a few years ago.  I'm not going to say that.  We don't mean it literally, you dumbass.  It's what Psycho Mark would say.  Right.  Just say your mom's box.  That's it.  And you're not saying my mom's box. 
[01:11:00]  You're saying your mom's box.  Right.  You're saying it to other people.  Right.  You're saying, hey, your mom's box, not my mom's box.  You can't say that to her, though.  That's not nice.  All right.  Lady Di, we got to go.  We'll talk to you later.  Yeah, I guess.  Just walk away.  Just find that box of wine.  Chug it down.  Get yourself in a nice drunken Tuesday morning stupor.  And just walk away.  Hang up, Lady Di. 
[01:11:30]  Hang up.  Think about your son, your dad that was so disappointed in you your whole life.  People that want to help you that you just will not accept.  Drink your problems away, Lady Di.  You're lying.  Drink them away.  That's it.  This will make you feel better.  You make Jim Laird sound like George Washington, you liar.  Maybe they're going to laugh out of the room.  Yes, Lady Di, yes.  Where's my MiFi? 
[01:12:00]  Am I ever going to get one?  No, you're not going to get a MiFi, Lady Di.  You don't get a MiFi.  So you can hock it for booze?  Lady Di, just hang up.  Just hang up, Lady Di.  Just hang up.  Hang up that phone.  The phone.  Hang it up.  Have a thread of dignity and put that receiver into the cradle.  You know, the cradle that you used to raise your son in?  That then is empty now because you're unfit as a mother? 
[01:12:30]  I'm not unfit as a mother.  Just hang up, please.  Just hang up the phone.  Bye-bye.  Fit?  Bye-bye, Lady Di.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye, Lady Di.  Bye.  Slip into that tsunami of wine.  That'll go into your mouth.  We'll talk to you another time, all right, Lady Di?  Yeah.  All right, bye-bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Goodbye. 
[01:13:00]  Hang up, Lady Di.  Lady Di?  What?  Hang up.  Hang up the phone.  No.  Hang up the effing phone.  I'm not.  Hang up the fucking phone!  All right, then we'll hang up for you. 
[01:13:30]  We'll both hang up on the count of three, okay?  On three, we hang up together, okay?  Two.  One.  One.  Bye.  Bye.  Why didn't you hang up?  Oh.  Because you can't count to three. 
[01:14:00]  Oh.  Listen to that cackle.  Come on.  Lady Di, hang up, please?  No.  All right, we gotta go.  We gotta go.  All right, we'll just keep you there all day.  I don't give a fuck.  Okay.  All right, Anthony, we're gonna take our first break of the morning.  What's on the show today?  Is Jay Moore really calling in today, finally?  Our old pal, Jay Moore? 
[01:14:30]  He can wake up.  He's been trying to wake up for like a month, just so he can talk to us, because he's in  L.A.  Yeah, it's very early for him.  Still a huge friend, obviously, but he just can't wake up to call in to say hi to us.  That's all right, he's gonna...  I'll say hi to him.  Oh.  Oh, there's her music.  Now she's out here.  Thank you, Lady Di.  Get retarded, get retarded, get retarded, get retarded, let's get retarded, let's get  retarded in here, let's get retarded, let's get retarded, let's get retarded in here. 
[01:15:00]  You know, just when you thought, remember years ago when she first came on the show with  Marion, and they were truly the retarded LaBernon and Shirley?  Yeah.  We thought they were both messes.  Yeah.  And you couldn't possibly imagine Lady Di being any more of a mess than she was then?  She is 100 times worse now of a mess than she ever was back then.  How does somebody so low to the ground fall so far? 
[01:15:30]  I don't know, that's Liza Minnelli.  Another drunk.  Another drunk.  We'll get into that and a few other things in a few minutes here, okay?  The drunk woman's so fat, she's falling down!  All right, well.  And then we got like five lovely ladies.  Are they here?  No, not yet.  Oh.  And what are they going to do today?  They're going to get on the couch.  They're going to get on the lesbian couch?  Yes.  Yeah, we have a bunch of girls going to get together and do things to each other on the 
[01:16:00]  couch today.  Five girls?  Five girls.  And the reason is?  The guy wants to plug for his business.  The guy wants to plug?  For his business.  What does he do?  I don't know.  I forget.  I've got to look it up.  Was it with girls he works or is he just hiring these chicks to come in?  I believe he's hiring the chicks.  Uh-oh.  All right, well.  I hope they do something.  I want to see a good daisy chain.  Yeah, I'm sure it'll be a complete disaster.  Of course it will.  Yeah, they'll be giggling and not wanting to take their tops off.  It never works.  You've got to beg.  Right.  Voss.  You're in junior high again.  And Voss is coming in today? 
[01:16:30]  No, Voss.  Voss will come in tomorrow.  He sent an email.  Voss.  Sleepy.  So I am too tired to come in and he spells two, T-O.  He's 44.  And he doesn't understand that two is T-O-O.  Well, I get confused with that one, too, myself.  He is a fool.  I'm too tired.  He sent me one email at midnight and he wrote, it's 12 p.m.  I'm just going to sleep.  Hopefully I can get a few hours of sleep in.  I look on the email, it's like 12.05 a.m. 
[01:17:00]  12 p.m.  What an idiot.  All right.  Well, someone requested one of those technical version spots.  I think they requested like 40 minutes ago.  We've been talking an hour and 15 minutes straight.  Yeah, why not?  All right.  We'll continue.  I know my mom worries about me.  She's afraid I'll do too much too soon and with the wrong boy.  That's why she got me this.  First, I was a little nervous.  But when mom showed me how to use it, I knew boys could wait.

[01:24:30]  The O&A virus spreading across America.  Eh, okay.  It's truly like the plague.  Huh?  It's truly like the plague.  Yeah.  Lady Di. 
[01:25:00]  Hey.  Oh, Jesus.  You're kidding me.  I'm still on the air.  On the air.  No, you're on hold.  I'm on hold.  Why is that funny?  No, I'm not.  No, no, no.  What?  I'm still out with you guys.  What?  I'm still out with you guys.  What?  Do you want to talk to my roommate for a minute?  No.  For a minute?  No.  Yeah.  Come on.  Just for a minute.  Have some more to drink, Di.  All right.  Hold on one second. 
[01:25:30]  Hold on.  What music are they listening to, by the way?  I've been trying to figure that out.  Crap music.  In the crap hole.  Jimmy Buffett.  Scared me.  What's up, buddy?  Hello?  Hey, what's going on?  No, no.  I'm just listening to Pink Floyd.  Oh, Pink Floyd.  There you go.  I know.  It's really relaxing me.  I think something else is relaxing you.  What are you drinking?  I had a couple glasses of wine. 
[01:26:00]  That's it.  Wine.  But why are you guys still awake?  Why?  Good question.  Because she keeps me up all night with her loud mouth.  She's always talking and yapping.  You two are made for each other, man.  You sound like a couple.  You sound like you're a couple.  Yep.  What kind of place is this that you guys live in?  Oh, it's a nice house.  It's very nice.  I live in a hovel.  But who owns it?  It's a hovel.  Who owns it?  Louie.  All right.  Louie rents rooms?  No, Louie.  No, it's not a room. 
[01:26:30]  Louie owns the house, and he rents upstairs.  He lives downstairs.  He's a really nice Italian man.  All right.  And you guys have separate rooms upstairs?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  I got my own room.  And I ain't dealing with her.  She's going to her own room.  Yeah, all right.  And this Louie guy, if he finds out what, he'll be angry.  What?  No, I hand him money every month.  I give him the rent.  Yeah.  And she gives him the rent, and we're all good. 
[01:27:00]  But it sounded like you said if Louie hears this, he's going to kick you out.  No, Louie ain't kicking me out.  Louie likes me.  No, he's just so drunk.  No, Louie's going to kick out Di for being too loud.  Oh, maybe Diana.  Yeah.  All right.  She said that, dude.  I'm not loud at all.  Now, she said that you hit on her sometimes.  I hit on her?  That's what she was saying.  Yeah, she's.  I was hitting on her?  That's what she said.  Yep.  Hitting her or what?  No, trying to get to bed with her.  Yeah, she said that you want her bad. 
[01:27:30]  I got a lot of other girlfriends.  I got Sherry.  I got Donna.  I got Allison.  Allison.  Allison.  Allison.  I got a lot of other girlfriends.  Yeah, and they're a little.  I don't need her.  They're a little hotter than Lady Di, huh?  Oh, way hotter.  Not even?  I got pictures, too.  I don't think much.  Pictures of what?  Them naked?  Not yet.  All right.  Well, you guys continue your party.  We got to move on, okay?  No, I'm ready to crash out.  I'm just listening to Pink Floyd.  I'm ready to go. 
[01:28:00]  Dark Side of the Moon, right?  Yeah.  Right on.  Coming up next.  Enjoy your noon hangover.  Those are always enjoyable.  I don't have a hangover.  All right.  All right, brother.  You will.  There you go.  I like that guy.  There's something about him.  All right.  Speaking of music, we got this Ozzy thing that's going to drive Jim nuts, I think.  What?  You know how we play the mashups?  Yes.  We're not going to play this whole thing, but I just want to get your opinion on it.  Ozzy and a mashup.  Does it kick in? 
[01:28:30]  Sorry, kick it. 
[01:29:00]  Oh, here it comes.  There it is.  Oh, look at over in the corner.  We have Governor McGreevy dancing away.  There he is.  Oh.  The AIDS spores are dancing to this music.  This could be some of the gayest music ever.  When you hear stuff like this, you just think gay club, right? 
[01:29:30]  Like you're clubbing, gay clubbing.  So you picture Ozzy biting the head off a cock.  Ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  This is awful.  Ow.  Ow.  Hey, Frankie Blue on KTU, everybody. 
[01:30:00]  Give me my box of wine, lady, or I'll call the cops.  This is Frankie Blue with you on WNE, KT, U, and Earl, you black bastards, get me a drink.  This is definitely Frankie Blue music.  It's absolutely awful is what it is.  Frankie Blue a load on another guy's ass music, maybe.  This is some...  Wow, that is the gayest music ever.  I think it gets gayer than that. 
[01:30:30]  I assume, no?  Music to have gay sex to.  Yeah.  That is music to bite a pillow really hard to.  Oh!  Make that sound a man can only make when he's having one shoved deep.  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Charles Nelson Reilly.  I like that music.  Oh! 
[01:31:00]  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  I think that song plays over the loudspeaker at Sirius.  Wow, man.  You're obsessed with that whole thing.  Dan, dan, dan, dan, dan, dan, dan, dan, dan, dan, dan, dan.  I've been so nervous since Nell got here.  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  We got another one in, too.  Magic Carpet Ride.  Is this gay?  It's pretty gay. 
[01:31:30]  So far, so good, right?  Sounds like the original.  All right.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  And here we go.  What the?  This is a clusterfuck. 
[01:32:00]  Come on!  I don't think it'll be too popular with the brothers.  It's pretty bad.  Okay, terrific.  Yeah, okay, terrific on that one.  That's like a mash-up that, it's like two things that really didn't fit.  Usually they make them kind of fit, where it's like, wow, I never knew that song kind 
[01:32:30]  of would have fit to this.  Right.  Well.  That's like awful.  And then, uh, what is this?  It wasn't that gay, though.  Sir Mix-a-Lot and Iron Man?  Hmm.  Is this bad, Ben?  Oh, I don't know.  Oh, I don't know.  Oh, I don't know.  Oh, I don't know.  V-O-V-O-V-O-V-O-V-O. 
[01:33:00]  Sieg Pile.  What are they saying?  Panther Fouse?  You can strike a match in my hand.  Too black to tan.  Heavy metal river from a one-man band.  Bust my knuckles in a junkyard scuffle.  Whippin' at a sandwich with a brass bell buckle.  Born in the ghetto.  Hard like metal.  Got an A7 bet with a fat gas pedal.  Live a hard life.  Shave with a knife. 
[01:33:30]  Love to get freaky on the boomie.  It's nice.  I got childhood scars in the streets of my life.  Girls laugh.  Now they're begging to be mixed up on swipe.  The new breed is here.  Bitch, I laugh.  He's a trap.  Got eyes like fire with my boys in my back.  Now I'm back for revenge.  Now the rumors must end.  Freaky breathing is out.  Cold music is in.  A lot of dummies getting money just for clapping their hands.  Got the style or desire of a true Iron Man.  Turn it off. 
[01:34:00]  Turn it off.  Oh, Southside rumor.  Don't drink rumor.  Big money maker not a dumb drug dealer.  If real not trauma, hate pet llama.  Met Clint Eastwood slap the mama.  I'm Big Dick Black.  All right, whatever.  It's over, Johnny.  Yeah, that's wonderful.  Thanks, sir.  All right.  Those were awful mashups. 
[01:34:30]  Yeah, they were horrendous.  Let's go to Jim the Trucker.  Hey, Jim, what's up?  Hey, what's happening, guys?  We're waiting for the five ladies from Long Island to enter the studio.  Oh, they're from Long Island, too?  Right.  Makes it even better.  South Shore, right?  I bet you they're from Bay Shore.  Ugh.  Do they have the rake hairdo?  The rake bangs going?  The waterfall is going?  The waterfall bangs?  I don't know.  Oh, that's going to be awful.  Hey, Opie.  Yeah?  Yeah, I was thinking, were you listening to that music, Buddy in the Pillow with your buddy 
[01:35:00]  there in that job-a-log?  All right.  Job-a-log?  Any job-a-logs of that music?  Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding,  ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding,  I'm not sharing with you guys anymore.  Hey, I got a midget sighting for you.  Two of you guys are interested.  Well, not really because you don't know how to follow protocol on the midget sightings.  Well, I tried it last week, but my phone kept cutting out, so I'll try again next week.  What you do is you just kind of call, and all of a sudden on the screen it says midget sighting, 
[01:35:30]  and then I get to play the interrupt this program thing, and then it all makes sense.  Yeah, okay.  All right.  Thanks, bro.  No, Tom.  All right.  Let's go to Tom the trucker.  What's up, Tom?  Oh, not much.  What's going on, guys?  We're talking to you.  What do you got?  I left a message on your fuck you line the other day, and you guys played it yesterday.  I sent a magnifying glass to Stern so Robin could actually see his dick and he could have a good weekend.  He mentioned it yesterday.  I think Howard's is on vacation, so I don't know what you're getting at. 
[01:36:00]  I'm not really sure.  Somebody told me he was talking about it yesterday, and I thought it was kind of hilarious.  I'll punch it out.  All right, good buddy.  All right, Tom.  Thank you.  It was awful.  So Liza Minnelli hurt herself.  They're trying to claim that she fell out of bed, but now they're saying that she just was drunk like Lady Di and fell down and hit her head?  She's pulling a Lady Di. 
[01:36:30]  Yeah, one of the newspapers said they must have had her official press release, which said she fell out of bed.  She was sleeping.  She like rolled over and fell out of bed and hit her head.  That's a PR person trying to spin it.  And I think that was the Daily News.  These PR persons are just savages.  They're all like Lady Di, compulsive liars.  Right.  They just lie about their clients to try to keep them out of trouble.  Right.  And then I think the Post, they kind of led us on to the fact that she might have had something to drink.  I think the headline was, Drunk Liza Falls on Head. 
[01:37:00]  You got to love the Post.  They just don't care.  The Daily News is like, Liza, because I think one of them has, one of their writers are real good buddies, like butt buddies with Liza.  And they don't want to ruin Liza getting them all these celebrity scoops.  Hey, Daily News.  You nailed it, dude.  Yeah, the Post.  Drunk Liza hurt and fall.  Yeah.  Drunk Liza.  Liza Minnelli was rushed to the hospital early yesterday after a drunken fall in her east side apartment. 
[01:37:30]  The troubled entertainer was taken to New York Hospital with a head injury after a bodyguard called 911.  This is the reason you call 911, by the way.  Not because your box of wine was hidden by one of your roommates.  What a dope.  Her bodyguard called 911 at 321 a.m. to say she had fallen and he couldn't get her up.  Fallen and can't get up.  Liza's fallen and she can't get up.  And she was taken out on a stretcher, was intoxicated, and fell out of the bed, the source said. 
[01:38:00]  That's great.  She can't even look.  Like, look at her own mother, who was just a complete waste drunk by the time she croaked.  I love that trouble.  You never want to be referred to as troubled celebrity.  Right.  Just like, you know, you don't want to be referred to as one of the guys that had people have sex in a church.  What?  It's kind of embarrassing.  It always comes up.  Yeah.  It doesn't matter what they do.  Could be, you know, Opie and Anthony discover cure for AIDS. 
[01:38:30]  Oh, great.  You know, and talk about how we worked in our lab for years and got the cure for AIDS.  And at the bottom of that story, you know what it would say?  You may remember Opie and Anthony, a duo that was thrown off the air for...  Yeah, they have to end every article about us with that.  Oh, and by the way...  And then, this is more local, but it could lead into something a little silly.  Where's the news day?  Eddie Leighton died.  That is local if you're grabbing for the news day.  I know.  Eddie Leighton died. 
[01:39:00]  He was the organist that played at the Yankee games.  Oh, the Yankee Stadium organist.  He was legendary.  Didn't he do...  Yeah, he did that.  You know how hard it is to find a guy to play the exact same song?  Oh, that's got to be tough.  That's got to be impossible.  But he was legendary.  He probably had dreams and aspirations as a keyboard player. 
[01:39:30]  Just do this.  Dun, dun, dun, dun.  Can I go dun, dun, dun, dun?  No, no.  Stick to dun, dun, dun, dun.  There he is.  There's Eddie Leighton.  Oh, long-time Yankee organist.  He just died at the ripe old age of 79 after a very short illness, they're saying.  Where did he start playing?  The Coliseum in Rome?  Look at his picture.  He's been doing it for like four decades, Anthony.  Four decades, huh? 
[01:40:00]  He's part of the fabric that is Yankee Stadium.  Oh, of course he is.  But I guess the point I'm trying to make, there are signs when you get older that you're going to die.  I thought Steinbrenner was going to have him pitching for us next season.  He likes putting the old codgers in there, doesn't he?  Oh, look.  They have a picture of him in Newsday, and he has his World Series ring.  They give the organ player a ring?  It looks like it.  Those rings mean nothing.  Unless the poor bastard had to buy his own.  Yeah.  Some of these guys that are kind of associated with these sports teams, they've got to buy 
[01:40:30]  their own rings after their team wins.  Yeah, but at least you can buy it.  It's like one of those things, you're given a ring, even if you have to buy it yourself.  Right.  But the organist, what did he really do?  Oh, we couldn't have done it without...  We didn't know when to charge.  We were going to just run off charging, but you gave us the...  And we knew, charge, here's your ring.  You know, he retired in 2003, and one of his big moments, when Leighton's retirement was 
[01:41:00]  announced during the seventh inning stretch of a game in September of that season, the  crowd of 43,000 chanted, Eddie, Eddie, as he played, take me out to the ballgame from  his glass-and-clothes booth on the press level.  That was the moment?  Yeah.  Yeah, one of his big moments.  What year was that?  2003, he retired.  But we see the picture of Eddie in the paper, and it just, I don't know, it brought up something 
[01:41:30]  that Ant and I were talking about before the show.  There's signs when you get older that you're going to die soon.  When you start dressing like a captain of a luxury cruise liner.  Yeah, why is he dressed as a captain?  He's got the captain's hat on.  Like, look at us.  And the navy blue captain's jacket.  Look at us.  We're not that old.  We're wearing today's clothes from, I don't know, Banana Republic and maybe some Abercrombie  and Fitch and The Gap and just normal clothing, right? 
[01:42:00]  Whatever covers me up.  What happens in your life from where we're at today and where Eddie was just before he  died looking like he's a captain of a ship?  There was a day he made a conscious decision to don the captain's hat and captain's jacket.  Right.  And I don't think it was when he was maybe in his 30s.  Yeah.  Well, when you see old people kind of walking around New York City, they start taking on  some unusual styles.  And you just know they're close to death.  And he has the giant old people glasses on, too. 
[01:42:30]  Right.  Look at the size of those things.  There is a point that you reach in life where you just give up, I think.  And you go for the easy look.  He must have just had a closet full of those things.  Yeah.  And you see the old people trucking around and they got those polyester pants pulled up  to their nipples with the belt and the shirts and the leisure suit jackets.  Yeah.  One day you're hip wearing jeans and this and that. 
[01:43:00]  And then one day you have to make the conscious decision that you're going to pull up your pants  up to your nipples.  You're going to, yeah, model your clothing wear after Fred Mertz and just pull them up to  your nipple where only six inches of your tie shows because the rest are tucked into your  pants.  That's right, Rick.  We're going to get some ladies tonight, Rick.  Not dressed like that, Fred.  Just an observation. 
[01:43:30]  He's looking, you know, he's looking like.  When does it happen?  You don't think old people, you're like, weren't they cool at some point in their life?  In the 50s?  We're wearing a leather jacket or something.  And then they just get older and decide to put on that stuff and wear it up to their  nipples and wear the white patent leather shoes.  Yeah.  Move down to Florida.  Hat with an anchor on it.  A hat with an anchor on it.  He's got a hat with an anchor on it.  That's never good.  And didn't the captain from the Captain and Tennille kind of do that? 
[01:44:00]  Isn't he ripping him off?  Keyboard play with the captain wear on.  It looks like he should be in Caddyshack.  The only thing good about glasses that size is he can see the fist of a younger person  crashing into his face to take his wallet and his World Series ring that he didn't earn.  Can I have this ring?  My prostate's about to fall out.  Give him a ring.  You know what the reality of this whole thing is?  Because life just stinks because it's about Schmidt again. 
[01:44:30]  They'll have a young go-getter in his place next year.  Oh.  Or they probably already did because, yeah, he retired in 2003.  Oh.  Probably his famous organ that he's been playing for four decades will be just carefully removed.  Get it out.  There'll be some nice, brand-new, programmable thing in there that he can just get any sound  this old guy could get off of his big, old keyboard.  Eddie's organ will be in storage for a couple years.  Yeah.  And then time will take its toll on his organ.  He's playing, like, some new songs. 
[01:45:00]  Some newer songs.  Not the same old.  Dun, dun, dun, dun.  What can he play?  Maybe.  What was that one?  Fanfare for the Common Man?  What?  Which one is that?  Isn't that an old Emerson Lake and Palmer song?  Oh, all right.  That would be new to that old song.  How does it go, though, Roger?  Now I need to hear it.  What is that?  We'll go to Bobby B.  Do some kind of mash-up with Ozzy Osbourne or something.  Yeah, you could play some mash-ups.  One hand playing one tune, the other hand playing another. 
[01:45:30]  Bob?  Yes.  I hate organ players at baseball games anyway.  There's no reason for it.  There's too much noise.  I'm so sick of it.  Fucking charge and all that crap.  It gets them all psyched.  No, it doesn't.  It stinks.  Ready to go.  This?  Yeah, you know this?  No.  Is the beginning long?  Oh, should I even ask?  It's Emerson Lake and Palmer.  This will go like 8,000 years.  Those guys love their dope.  What happened to it?  He's trying to cue it up for you.  He's trying to cue it up to the hook. 
[01:46:00]  Get a post.  The hook?  You know this?  The Olympics theme kind of hipped up.  They don't play this at sporting events?  What?  World of sports.  Oh, that.  Yeah, okay.  No, I've heard this played on the organ.  At sporting events, but not for years.  Maybe at an ABA game.  Exactly.  You're dating yourself.  When was the last time you heard this at a sporting event?  I don't know, but they were.  Rick Barry was throwing an underhand foul shot with a red, white, and blue ball. 
[01:46:30]  For the New York Nets.  Bobby Big Rigger, what's up?  Hey, Owen Ant.  Good morning.  Oh, Big Rigger.  Bobby Big Rigger, yes.  Scared me for a minute.  I was ready to hide my wallet.  Okay.  Hey, we can rewind the show here a second?  Yes.  Wait.  Okay, thank you.  I was reading the inquiries this morning.  Liza Minnelli said she was involved in a treadmill incident.  I can't figure that one out. 
[01:47:00]  So she didn't fall out of bed.  She fell on her treadmill.  She's knocking her face against the treadmill.  You think she's going to go for a run?  Watch it now.  All right, thank you.  Fat lady died like she was going to run on the treadmill.  I was running with my face.  What?  What?  Ben, what's going on over there?  Ben just laughs at the stupidest thing.  It's yawning, laughing, crazy-haired Ben.  Milk diva.  I just want milk for cereal.  What happened?  And you have to laugh on your table?  I think it's funny, yeah. 
[01:47:30]  He's just his face.  You guys are in the middle of something.  His face, he gets all pissed off.  I'm just trying to have some cereal.  I'm trying to understand, Ben.  You and I, for the first hour of the show, we're just broadcasting our asses off,  and he's yawning through the whole thing.  I yawned once.  But a stupid...  I yawned...  Wait a second.  I yawned once.  No, a couple times.  I yawned once.  It's a stupid intern.  Yeah, but it lasted until 6.38.  Yeah, the stupid intern comes in and...  Stupid intern?  Oh, Jesus.  Go ahead, let him finish.  He's right.  Can I have some milk, please?  And he brings me the cereal, and now it's half-soaked with a little bit of milk, 
[01:48:00]  and now I gotta wait for the rest, so it's just gonna be soggy and awful.  So now...  I need cereal to be like soup.  Yeah, so now Jimmy is discussing some kind of milk thing with Danny, and Ben is laughing  hysterically, so I guess that's the type of thing we need on our show, to entertain Ben.  I need more milk in my cereal, Danny, eh?  This is gonna look like Eddie Layton's prostate by the time he...  Leave Eddie alone, man.  He was a legend.  World Series ringing?  Fuck him.  Old man annoying everyone with the stupid noises. 
[01:48:30]  Ba-ba-right.  We fucking get it.  Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun.  There he is.  Hey, Tim from St. Louis, what's up?  What's up, guys?  How are you, bro?  I got a good bit about those tsunami people that got hit with the hurricane.  Wait, wait.  My head is spinning by the way the interns spelled tsunami.  Wow.  I've never seen tsunami spelled that way.  Who spelt tsunami? 
[01:49:00]  Is that how they spelt it on TV?  Eric, are you insane?  That's how you spell tsunami?  T-P-T-P-S?  I've never seen a word in the English writers that has the T-P combo.  T-P-S-E-U-N-A-M-I.  Tsunami.  Isn't it E before U except after what?  I don't know the rule.  That is the worst spelling ever. 
[01:49:30]  I don't even know if I can spell it the right way, but at least it would look a little better on the screen.  I would get it confused with the T or the P because I knew it started with some stupid letter that they don't pronounce.  No, it's T-S, right?  It is T-S.  T-P-S-U-T-U-N-A-M-I.  Tsunami.  Yeah.  Z-R-Q-L-Y.  Tsunami.  Tim, what's going on?  So what do you got about the tsunami?  Now, you got a picture of these guys.  You can use different scenarios.  So they're sitting on the beach saying, you know, Jimmy, I got this beachfront property. 
[01:50:00]  You can be just like me.  Now, come on.  Come on.  When did you realize that character was...  There you go.  There you go.  Hey, it's funny.  Connor and Lacey.  Anyway, I'm going to see you at Zanies in Chicago, Jimmy.  Thank you.  All right.  Now I feel like a fucking asshole.  You are a fucking asshole.  You were going for a joke and bombed.  You guys let me hang to him.  I wasn't fresh. 
[01:50:30]  Exactly.  We let you hang.  God damn it.  Are you fucking with me?  Love you guys.  Love you guys.  I'm an idiot.  It's so funny.  And then he didn't even leave a gap to see if it was going to laugh.  He just started talking nervously over where the laugh should have been.  Yeah, that's a beachfront property.  But, you know, all kidding aside, happy holidays to you.  I think we don't know that trick.  You tanked.  All right.  Let's say hi to Kimberly in New Hampshire.  Kimberly?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  A girl.  Oh, be a girl.  Hey, we love girls.  I'm freezing my butt off in New Hampshire. 
[01:51:00]  Yes.  How much snow did you guys get up there?  Excuse me?  How much snow?  Oh, well, Dad, it wasn't much.  It was like four inches.  Well, I know parts of Boston got like a foot, right?  I guess.  I'd hardly go down there.  Are the girls cute in New Hampshire?  Not really.  I'm not from New Hampshire.  I'm from Virginia Beach, so I can say that.  Oh, you must be a stripper up there then.  At Matthews.  No, not really.  Remember that Matthews?  Oh, yeah.  They look like granite heads up here.  It's the Granite State, so they all have granite heads. 
[01:51:30]  Granite heads?  Yeah.  What does a granite head look like?  A flintstone stripper.  Do you know the old man on the mountain whose face just fell off?  Yes, there's a big monument in New Hampshire, and it was the old man on the mountain, and  it was made out of granite, and from a certain angle, it looked like a profile of an old man.  Yeah.  And I guess a year ago or so, it just fell off the side of the mountain.  It's been there for thousands of years.  A thousand years.  It just slid off the side of the mountain.  One day he said, you know what?  I'm done.  I'm done. 
[01:52:00]  And that's the symbol of the whole state, right?  Yeah, it was like the symbol.  It's on all kinds of state memorabilia and stuff.  And now it looks like old man's shriveled cock of the mountain just kind of dangling  off the mountain, and I don't think that'll sell as well.  I hope there was an anchor hat on it before it fell off and died.  Huh?  Look on the back of a New Hampshire quarter, okay?  Yeah.  And that granite face there, that's what most of the chicks look like up here.  Yeah.  Oh, like old granite head.  They're awful.  Oh, speaking of granite head, look at Liza Minnelli. 
[01:52:30]  They're showing her on the news, on Fox News, and she is just awful.  Big bloated alcohol lady die face.  With that half a fag ex-husband.  Half.  That gourd full fag.  Go ahead, Kimberly.  So what do you have for the program?  Well, I was wondering if you happened to notice that Christopher Reed was wearing a captain's  hat before he died.  Oh, was he?  Yeah.  If you want to live a long life, stay away from the captain hats.  What is he wearing a captain hat?  He's navigating the SS wheelchair down the hallway? 
[01:53:00]  What the hell?  Don't wear a captain hat unless you're a captain.  He probably won it in the unlucky lottery.  Oh.  There you go.  Punch it out.  Yeah, punch out.  Yeah, you better punch out of that.  I had my finger was itching for that crash button.  Little rule of thumb, you can't wear a captain's hat if someone has to scoop out your bowels.  Jesus.  What did Eddie do to you?  No, not him.  I meant Christopher Reeve.  Oh.  Oh, sorry.  Yeah. 
[01:53:30]  Yeah.  I messed it up.  I'm really...  A little bad now.  Yeah, that's right.  Let's go to James, the trucker in California.  Hey, James.  Hey, how you guys doing?  Good.  Sounds like your rig has problems this morning.  Nah, I'm going up high five.  It's not the smoothest road in the highest road.  All right.  What do you got today?  I stopped off at a whorehouse out in Nevada the other night.  You did?  Yep.  And?  Is this a three-part joke?  No.  I think I'm pretty sure that sucks.  She talked me into paying a whole hour. 
[01:54:00]  And she said I could have the whole hour due, you know, how many times I wanted.  Yeah.  About ten minutes, that was it.  Cut me off, kicked me out the door.  Oh, you blew your first one in ten minutes and then she said you're done?  Yeah, she ripped out the little vibrator thing and stuck it underneath my sack and that was it.  I was done and she got up, got dressed, and kicked me out the door.  Uh, Jim?  Yep.  Is this protocol?  Um, yeah.  They call it how many cups you can get.  Can you get more than one cup or two cups for the hour?  But normally I pop once. 
[01:54:30]  But yeah, some say you can get more than once, but you're dumb if you believe that.  So it's like either you come or an hour, whatever comes first.  They'll never give you an hour, dude.  Unless it's a high-class place.  Never.  They're going to be uncomfortable.  They're going to try to rush you.  They stink.  She took me on a tour and showed me the VIP room with the hot tub and the chains on the walls  and said that, yeah, $350, you get two hours in here.  Well, I'm glad I didn't pay for the $350.  They make you come and then kick you out, yeah. 
[01:55:00]  Because you finish quick and then you're a...  Did I tell you something I tried to rob me when I was getting a whore probably about two weeks ago?  Get out of here.  Oh, yeah.  It wasn't a violent thing.  I went to this hotel.  He said, please.  Yeah, it wasn't violent.  Yeah.  I went to get a whore online that I had talked to online and I called her and I show up there  and she opens the door and she goes, all right, baby, I'm letting somebody out.  Give me five minutes.  Which is kind of annoying, but I'm like, all right, why not?  So I go wait in this area of the hotel and this black guy walks out and I see him walking 
[01:55:30]  around ready to get on the elevator, but he's on his cell phone and I'm on my cell phone.  I'm like, why is he hanging out?  It's kind of creepy.  If it was a white guy, would you have thought twice about it?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Just because I knew somebody was coming out of that apartment or that hotel room and I'm  like, I just didn't like the vibe of it.  So he finally walks over and he goes, you waiting to see whatever her name was?  And I'm like, yeah.  And he goes, all right, I'm with her, but you got to pay me before you go in.  Oh, what a gasp.  He was implying that he was her.  Nice.  That's a good game, man, that he's got going.  I'm like, what are you talking about? 
[01:56:00]  He's like, well, she told you she was just letting me out, right?  Well, this is how we make sure that there's no car.  He was so good, but I knew he was bullshitting.  But I'm like, I got to have that confirmed with her.  I'm going to call her number.  I was like, well, her number forged right to my phone.  He held his phone up.  This guy was terrific, but he kept trying to get me to give him the cash.  Do you mind if we dance with your dates?  Wow.  Is his name Sport?  Is his name Sport?  Was he asking if you want to, you know, you could do her in the ass.  You could do her in, never mind. 
[01:56:30]  What's that from?  What reference are you trying to do?  That was from Taxi Driver.  Come on.  Oh, Sport.  Okay.  All right.  I curse that that microphone is working today.  Oh, all right.  I'm putting it away.  I was waiting because I knew you meant something.  I knew it was a reference, but why can't we have technical problems when we want them?  Brother Joe, everybody.  So now you're going to, like, cheap hotels and stuff for the hookers?  Well, no.  That's where she was staying.  She's from out of town. 
[01:57:00]  So I go there.  This guy tries to get me to give him the money.  He's got a story.  He was so good, this guy, though.  Thank God I have some prostitute savvy.  Right.  What did you say?  I'm like, I got to have this confirmed with her.  But I didn't want to tell him to go fuck himself because that could, it was fairly legit because  sometimes these girls will have a driver.  It separates them from the actual cash.  So if you're a cop, you can't bust them for anything.  So it actually made some...  You guys got a pretty good scam.  Absolutely.  But I'm like, I got to have it confirmed with her.  He's like, well, you know what?  You can just go see another escort because we can't have this. 
[01:57:30]  And he's like, look, I just can't have you hanging out here in the lobby.  He wasn't menacing or threatening.  He's like, I can't have you hanging in the lobby.  I'm like, look, let me just talk.  And she called me while he was standing there.  And she's like, are you coming in?  And I'm like, well, I'm talking to your friend.  And she's like, my friend.  I'm like, yeah, your friend, Jay.  And she's like, oh, I'll call you right back.  So I wound up going down to the lobby and she called me again.  Like, this is from the hallway.  And she's like, could you tell security that he's up here hassling me and whatever he's  trying to rob me?  And I'm like, oh, okay, that's what's going on. 
[01:58:00]  I kind of figured.  So I called security.  I just told security.  And they got him out.  You know, someone's trying to rob the hooker.  That's exactly what it was.  What kind of security?  The hotel had security of some sort.  And so then I wait a few minutes.  She has to transfer rooms.  So I sit there and wait.  And she transfers rooms.  This image I'm getting conjured up in my head is just this shithole hotel.  It was.  Like, it's not this.  How bad was the hotel?  It was okay.  It wasn't great.  But it wasn't a total dump.  I don't remember that.  It was on the up west side somewhere.  It was one of those no-name places.  Like, it's between this and this. 
[01:58:30]  No, I know absolutely nothing of what you speak of.  There's a million hotels up there.  Like, you wouldn't even think they're hotels.  You walk by.  It looks like a big apartment building.  Oh, it's a little hotel.  Just look for the colored gentleman on the cell phone in the lobby.  Yeah, with the red coat.  So what did you get from this one?  I just got a Hummer.  AIDS?  Comidia?  Comidia, right.  There you go.  Just a Hummer.  Jesus.  So did you say anything?  Did you see the black gentleman after that?  I didn't see him actually leave.  I told security.  And I talked to her.  And she's like, she switched rooms. 
[01:59:00]  And she's like, come on.  And her stupid key wouldn't work.  She had to go down the lobby three times to get a new key.  I was so irritated.  Of course you were.  And then so the experience was like, eh, okay.  But I'm like.  If you saw that black gentleman, would you have said something like, ha, trying to screw  me out of my money?  I did see him once since then.  I saw him.  Holy yes.  I saw him on a.  He's a gang member.  I saw him.  Uh-oh.  But what's he going to get mad at me for?  He's stupid.  He's wearing red?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  But he's just trying to scam for some money.  No big deal.  Yeah, you better say no big deal.  When did you see him again? 
[01:59:30]  I was walking.  I saw him on a street corner with a butt.  But I wasn't.  How do you even recognize him?  The jacket was so, so.  I mean, it could have been somebody else.  But the face I remember.  But the jacket was so specific.  It was just.  I don't.  I couldn't describe it to you.  But if I saw it at a hundred jackets, that was it.  Yeah.  And the face.  And, you know.  But you know what?  That wasn't a violent confrontation.  It was just he was trying to scam for some cash.  It was pretty ingenious actually.  Didn't that bug you?  No.  That really bugs me.  It didn't bug me because it was such.  He saw him.  He probably didn't.  I mean, look at me.  I don't look like I've gotten a thousand prostitutes. 
[02:00:00]  I don't think.  I think it bugs me more because I probably would have fallen for it.  Been all intimidated and given him the money.  He was so.  Screwed.  Good.  That's why it bugs me.  Yeah.  You know you're doing something wrong and you're like, oh, God.  Yeah.  I bet.  Yeah.  Being here is wrong.  I better just pay this guy.  You just paid this guy.  And then the girl would have come down and I said, yeah, I paid the guy.  What?  No.  He's not.  That was why.  And I'd have been like, wow.  God damn.  I got screwed.  But if she would have confirmed that.  Now I have to come out of anger. 
[02:00:30]  But Jimmy's savvy.  I just knew.  But it wasn't.  He was so good.  Yeah.  He was so good.  I was almost tempted because his rap was great.  He wasn't flustered when I said, look, well, I got a caller.  He's like, go ahead.  Her phone's forwarded to mine.  He held up his phone.  It was just like he was so comfortable.  He was really good.  So I wasn't mad at him.  I wanted to go, Jesus, dude.  That was fantastic.  You know what?  And it probably works nine out of ten times for the guy.  I'm sure it does.  He had no money and he was trying to bang her for free.  So I think he might have just been trying to get money to just get laid.  Oh, wow.  So that was a motivator.  Oh, then it was a noble cause.  But he was coming out of her room, so he probably banged her and then he's trying to get his 
[02:01:00]  money back now through you.  She told me what happened.  She said that he was a black guy and she normally only sees white guys.  Thank God she pointed that out.  That fellow sure was dirty.  Did he seem black to you?  No, she said that he called and said he was a white guy.  She's like, and then he shows up and he's black.  And a lot of times the girls won't see black guys because they try to get it for free.  But she sees the black guy through the peephole.  She lets him in.  And he tried to scam free sex.  And she's like, no, no, no. 
[02:01:30]  Is that known in the industry that black guys will try to scam it for free?  I'm not going to mention any names, Keith Robinson, but a friend of mine used to rob prostitutes.  No!  They would rob hookers.  They would bang them and then make the whores give the money back.  Wow.  Yeah.  Was he playing GTA?  Jesus.  Grand Theft Auto.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We've got to get him on the phone.  What was his scam?  He would bang the hookers and then rob them?  Give me the money back, bitch.  No scam.  Yeah, no scam.  Wow, that's subtle.  Yeah.  All right, bitch.  There was a little trick called hand it back over or you lose your teeth. 
[02:02:00]  Ta-da.  We've got a guy that wants to thank you for the tutorial.  Pat in Buffalo.  What's up, Pat?  Hey, what's going on?  I wanted to thank Jimmy for his constant hooker tutorial.  Okay.  It's been very helpful.  Thanks to Jimmy, I decided to try this in-call service out of the phone book here.  Best experience of my life.  I've done this a few times.  Look at you, Jim.  Turning everyone on to hookers all over the country.  Wait, so you went to them? 
[02:02:30]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Called out.  There's a house and a nice little subdivision, a nice suburb.  What town, sir?  Blaisdell.  Where's that, Jersey?  It's Buffalo.  It's an okay town.  For Buffalo, it's probably, you know, like Beverly Hills.  Yeah, I understand.  I understand.  I'm not a fan of the in-call.  I don't like going to the places.  The in-call?  Out-calls when they come to you.  In-calls when you go to them.  It just knows all the lingo.  Out-calls.  My neighbors, it just would have been bad to have her show up at the house while the wife's 
[02:03:00]  on vacation in New York.  Oh, yeah, okay.  All right, so you got the number out of the phone book and you went there to Blaisdell.  Or Dale, right?  I called up to tell me to go to this corner and call when I get to.  Up there, they'll give me directions to the house.  What are you, setting up a hostage drop?  Go to the phone book, be there in five minutes or he's dead.  Dude, there's a mistress in Arizona that she makes you meet her at a Burger King and  she blindfolds you and drives you to her house so you don't know where she lives. 
[02:03:30]  Who's doing that?  Who the hell would do that?  I would.  Who the hell would do that?  Who the hell would?  Rixi Bin Laden.  I would because she's seen so many people, she has a good reputation on the net.  A good reputation?  She doesn't want freaks knowing exactly her address.  So what she'll do is she'll make you meet her at the Burger King.  She'll put like a blindfold on you and then drive you.  She probably pulls right into her garage.  No, I don't.  I would do it in a second.  It's like getting laid in a bat cage.  They knock you out with bat gas.  I'd put a GPS thing in my pocket and knock on a door the next day and go, ha, screw you 
[02:04:00]  and your blindfold, bitch.  You have to have a lot of trust to allow someone to do that to you.  That type of, yeah.  Are you insane?  In call is a...  Wake up like the clown from that movie Vulgar.  Yeah.  You're finally so vulgar, right?  Where you're getting pounded in the ass by a father and two sons.  All right, so...  You got to see Vulgar, Jim.  You bet I do.  It's a really sick, sick flick.  Sick movie.  You know, you remind me, my brother would bring home these pigs.  He was living in Oyster Bay or whatever. 
[02:04:30]  And he was like a caretaker at a really nice house.  And he didn't want any of these chicks to know where he lived.  So he would take the long way back to the highway, even though he literally lived a quarter  mile off the Long Island Expressway.  Make it all confusing.  Oh, yeah.  He would do left, right, left, right, and just go the long way around just so these  girls could never figure out where he brought them.  Why do you use chloroform like everybody else?  Yeah.  Duct tape.  Sure.  Meanwhile, they just see the street name when he gets on Green Street.  Oh, I know where this is.  Four hours of riding around for nothing.  All right. 
[02:05:00]  So you called the number, then you met where again?  On the street corner?  Oh, yeah.  They go to this gas station that's around the corner.  Give me, then there's a direction to the house.  I get there.  It's a nice house.  I'm still a nervous wreck, though, because I really don't know what I'm walking into.  Right.  Yeah.  But I get there.  The girl's hot.  She's like 5'2", dark hair, maybe 115 pounds.  Really, really sexy girl.  So I started feeling better right away.  But still, she takes me in this bedroom, gets the money, leaves the room. 
[02:05:30]  She comes back in and just comes up to me, wraps her arms around me, starts hugging me and kissing my neck and undressing me.  And they take the money out of the room.  This way, if you're dissatisfied, you can't get the money back.  It's somewhere else.  Yeah.  Standard.  And your wife was out of town?  Standard.  That's a G4 maneuver.  Yeah.  I know that.  And your wife was out of town?  Yeah.  She was on a little vacation doing some Christmas shopping.  Oh, how nice.  Yeah, I'm sure she was. 
[02:06:00]  Nice.  That's where I was supposed to be, too.  I was out Christmas shopping for her.  Yeah.  You ever think she's at some other house somewhere else, my friend?  I like these guys.  I like, yeah, she was out doing something.  I was at the whole house.  How are you so sure where she is?  You think the ladies cheat more than we think?  Because she was with her mother and her aunt.  All right.  And so...  I know exactly where she was.  All right.  And the experience was good, huh?  Oh, it was great.  She said the most beautiful thing anybody's ever said to me. 
[02:06:30]  Do you want me to keep sucking on it?  That is a nice one.  She's a lady.  Whoa.  All right.  And you learned all this from Jim, right?  Absolutely.  I wouldn't have got the idea if it wasn't for Jim.  Good man.  Are you going?  I've got to say thank you.  Promoting prostitution.  Call me when you stop wearing bags, though.  That's what I want to hear.  When you start going with whores with no bags.  All right.  The blowjob was bareback.  And then she asked me if I wanted to put a rubber on it and I chickened out and did. 
[02:07:00]  She gave you the option for full service of bareback?  Absolutely.  And bareback is without condom?  No bag.  They call it B-B-B-J.  Bareback B-J in a place.  Yeah.  It's very fuel off of your real sex without a bag.  All right.  150 for an hour.  I didn't think it was that bad.  That's Buffalo.  That's nice.  Did he get the whole hour?  About 40 minutes of it.  All right.  Buffalo.  Well, there you go, Pat.  Thank you.  Sure.  Thanks.  Bye, Pat. 
[02:07:30]  A couple more.  Let's go to Rich in Rhode Island.  Rich?  They got the Buffalo Hot Pussy up there, which is nice.  Right?  They got that?  What's that?  Nothing.  Forget it.  What is it?  Let me just hang my head in shape.  What is it?  You know what?  The hot sauce on it?  Blue cheese dressing?  It came out of my mouth before I even realized it, Jimmy.  You're a champ.  Taxi driver.  I hear you.  Hey, I could take him.  I know.  Buffalo.  I didn't.  You were doing it on what happened. 
[02:08:00]  A chicken wing joke?  It was a chicken wing joke and a pussy chicken wing joke.  I got to give myself a...  It's getting a little chilly in here.  What's that?  It's getting cold in here.  Could someone get a martini steam, please?  Why is it getting cold for you?  I'm hot.  I just didn't get it.  It wasn't...  Neither did I.  I didn't word it right.  It was a disaster, Jimmy.  But sometimes you're...  It's a complete and utter bomb. 
[02:08:30]  But sometimes you're too intelligent for the room, so maybe you should...  This isn't one of those times.  No.  I'll be this.  Do it again, so maybe we could take it in and maybe we miss something.  No, I won't be doing it again.  You're not going to rope me in like that.  Damn.  All right.  Rich from Rhode Island.  Yeah, I'm actually from Rhode Island.  I'm driving through Rhode Island.  But, Jim...  Yes.  Do you want me to hear this website?  It's called HalfPriceEscorts.com.  No.  I've never heard of it.  Half Price Escorts.  What the hell do you get from Half Price Escorts? 
[02:09:00]  Man, you're on price.  You need you to hookers.  Well, the thing is, you've got to pay like $10 a month to join.  And then they show you the girls' pictures.  But it's very technical.  Like you're talking about, they list if it's in call or out call.  They have like half price.  Dude, you can go to Craigslist to Eros Guide for free.  Why would you pay?  What the girls are going to do, they're going to price themselves at $150, $175 and say normally $350 for some fatso.  You need to write a book, Prostitutes for Dummies. 
[02:09:30]  Norton's Hooker Book.  You could definitely do that.  Prostitutes for Dummies.  That was just awful.  Dude, if you wrote a little pamphlet, Prostitutes for Dummies, I'm telling you, we'd sell thousands of them.  Did you ever, early in your hooker going to career, did you ever get taken?  Or did something ever happen where you're like, you learned something?  Yeah, one time.  Did you ever give the black guy the money?  No, never the black guy.  But one time in, oh, this is actually in New York.  Years ago, I was, this pregnant chick I picked up.  This is true. 
[02:10:00]  It's just a mess.  I wound up giving her head.  This pregnant chick, because she had what I like, which was very big, thick, you know.  Meaty.  Yeah, and I went down on her in the car, and she was great.  It's called the soft spot of the baby's head poking out.  Wow, you got a nice meaty one.  I like that.  Thank you.  Lick my fontanelle.  Oh, God.  I can feel a kick.  I like one that opens its eye and winks at me.  A little baby blue.  You get a heel print right in the teeth. 
[02:10:30]  So I went, the next time I went to see her, she gave me her number.  She lived in Harlem.  She was a white girl.  And I was living with Florentine in Jersey.  And I came back, and she wanted like $150.  I wanted to bring her back to Jersey, but she was getting weirded out about going over  the bridge and leaving the state to go to New Jersey.  So she was like $150, and she's like, look, I left a lot of pot on my kitchen table.  I got to put this away.  She's like, just give me $40 so I can just slip it under the door.  And I don't know why I believed her.  Oh, wow.  I think because we had seen each other before, and I had her number.  I'm like, yeah, she's going to.  Wow.  She's like, I'll be right back down. 
[02:11:00]  I'm like, all right.  And I just sat in the car for like 40 minutes.  And I'm like.  When did you start sinking in your head?  Uh-oh.  15 minutes in.  I'm like, uh-oh.  I'm like, I can't believe she just ripped me off for $40.  This dummy.  I would have given her $150.  When did you go down on her?  On the way?  Oh, no, no.  This is the second time I saw her.  Oh.  That was the only reason I gave her the money.  The first time I saw her, we had a great experience of parking like 44th Street.  Thought you had a little relationship going with her.  A little something.  Kids on the way.  No such thing as hook or trust.  No.  Oh, that's unbelievable.  And she took you for the $40. 
[02:11:30]  She just left.  But it's very rare.  Oh, I almost shared a girl one time with a buddy of mine, and I didn't.  She wanted the girl.  I ended up going down on me for a minute, but I couldn't get a rod.  So my friend banged her, and I couldn't do anything because I couldn't get it up.  And he eventually died of AIDS years later.  Wow.  Yeah.  You were that close?  Well, I mean, I wouldn't have gotten it from just getting a Hummer, but I didn't.  Yeah.  That was a close one.  Wow.  Was he a good friend?  Yeah, I know him pretty well.  Yeah.  I got the guy I knew from being sober. 
[02:12:00]  Oh, that's...  Wow.  He was a drug addict.  Thanks for bringing...  No, I'm not saying that to be sad.  I'm just saying sometimes when you're out there, you just...  No, really?  We're...  AIDS in a good way?  Yeah.  Yeah, we're real happy now.  Thanks.  I think he got...  Boy, you know, it's amazing how close he came to getting AIDS, though.  Or even close to AIDS.  That's what I'm saying.  I wouldn't have caught it.  It's like right there with a batch right in the girl that you were going to be with.  That's, you know, that's pretty close.  I leaned over to whisper something.  It was actually AIDS I was talking to.  Wow.  You were on the other end of the death rod for a minute. 
[02:12:30]  Yeah, but nothing happened with the girl.  I just couldn't get a ride.  I was packing a half.  You're cock new.  Yeah.  I think I'm insane.  Smell this.  So in the preface of the hooker book, there's no such thing as hooker trust?  No.  Well, no, you know what?  No.  No.  I got a couple of them that I see very regularly, and now, even with them, this one guy greedy  with me, and it was like, you dummy.  Why would you?  I'd give you so much money, and she got greedy over like 40 bucks.  I won't call her again.  Never again.  You showed her.  Well, it's just stupid.  It's like, I'm a good customer.  I'm easy.  I'm packing minimal.  I mean, I'm a very...  I'm clean.  You're not going to rip up the merchandise?  Absolutely. 
[02:13:00]  I'm not going to...  Yeah, exactly.  I don't run around like a bull in a china shop when I'm in your box.  I just kind of...  You don't put your feet on the seats?  You're a nice rider?  I'm a gentleman.  I just play out my nipples.  I'll look stupid, and I'll finish in four minutes.  Anthony.  Easy.  A quick musical interlude for Jimmy and his friend.  Everyone has AIDS!  AIDS, AIDS, AIDS!  AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS!  AIDS, AIDS!  Everyone has AIDS! 
[02:13:30]  And so this is the end of our story.  And everyone is dead from AIDS.  It took from me my best friend.  My only true pal.  My only bright star.  Well, I'm going to march on Washington.  Lead the fight and charge the brigades.  There's a hero inside of all of us.  I'll make them see everyone has AIDS.  My father, AIDS.  My sister, AIDS. 
[02:14:00]  My uncle and my cousin and her best friend.  AIDS, AIDS, AIDS!  The gays and the straights and the whites and the spades.  Everyone has AIDS!  My grandma and my dog are all blue.  AIDS, AIDS, AIDS!  The Pope has got it and so do you.  AIDS, AIDS, AIDS!  Come on, everybody, we got quilting to do.  We're going to break down these barriades, everyone.  AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS.  Bad smell, bad language, and now bad jokes.  This is the freakiest show I've ever been party to. 
[02:14:30]  Because we're perverts.  Really?  Stupid.  So you know it's good.  That's why we love doing this radio show.  Right?  Okay, terrific.  Time to put your mouth for our balls on.  Buckle up, kids.  It's cool.  Let's just put it this way.  Sexual harassment, mostly.  Just shut up.  I was so offended.  Don't listen, you twat.  Get her over the head with a shovel.  If you did that, I would make love to you right now.  Come on.  People that get their news from ONA are the same people who watched Sesame Street till they were 12.  Yes, precisely.  Guys talk about nasty stuff like this all the time. 
[02:15:00]  Sit down and put on your laughing hats because here comes a home run.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Ian Anthony.

Everybody in Hollywood, they're so show-busy.  Everybody's in show business.  Everybody you meet, the people at drugstore, grocery store, waiters, waitresses.  They're all frustrated screenwriters, directors, actors.  Even a policeman stops me for drunk driving.  He's a frustrated choreographer.  Instead of having me walk the line, he wants me to follow after him.  All right, here we go.  And follow after me.  Step, kick, ball, change, step, rise, step, step. 
[02:16:30]  Step, kick, ball, change, step, rise, step, step.  Smile, pretty, shuffle off the puffer.  Now, pretty fingers.  So I'm Mrs. Step, bitch.  Don't get me pissy.  I am in a mood.  Skydiving was definitely the scariest thing I've ever done.  Let me ask you this question in regards to the skydiving.  What is the point of the helmet in the skydiving? 
[02:17:00]  I mean, can you kind of make it?  You jump out of that plane.  That chute doesn't open.  The helmet is now wearing you for protection.  Later on, the helmet's talking with the other helmets, going,  it's a good thing he was there or I would have hit the ground directly.  There are many things that we could point to as proof that the human being is not smart.  The helmet is my personal favorite.  The fact that we had to invent the helmet. 
[02:17:30]  Now, why did we invent the helmet?  Well, because we were participating in many activities that were cracking our heads.  We looked at the situation.  We chose not to avoid these activities,  but to just make little plastic hats so that we can continue our head-cracking lifestyles.  The only thing dumber than the helmet is the helmet law,  the point of which is to protect a brain that is functioning so poorly  it's not even trying to stop the cracking of the head that it's in. 
[02:18:00]  At least the helmet is functional clothing.  I appreciate that.  It's everything 24-7.  XM-202.  The O&A virus.  It's everything.  All the time.  XM-202.  Give me fuel, give me fire, give me double, double, double, double.  It's the O&A virus spreading across America thanks to XM Satellite Radio. 
[02:18:30]  We have a party in here today.  Even if the sold-out Metallica rocks, you know, some guys just hate this Metallica.  This is so far after they sold out.  Two months ago.  It was amazing.  But I don't care, man.  Still amazing.  The guys rock. 
[02:19:00]  Yeah, we're live, by the way.  Oh, yeah.  Probably the only high-profile radio show in America that's broadcast live between Christmas and New Year's.  So I hope you're enjoying live programming.  Hey, people are checking in and saying, is that Adam Ferrara here every now and again?  Yeah, we didn't even get to give him the big introduction.  Hello.  Of course it is.  My pal.  Sure.  Hiya, pal.  Ain't seen you in a while.  Happy Yuletide.  Look, I got a radio show again.  I'm so happy.  He gets to play with his friends again, Adam.  Yeah.  It's great. 
[02:19:30]  It's been so long.  I get to come back and see my pals.  And now we can curse and everything.  Yeah.  It's great.  Did you move to Canada?  No, it's just a hat.  It was dark this morning.  You guys are nuts getting up this early.  Well, it's funny because Anthony and I are like, where's Adam been?  Yeah.  And I was thinking you walked in with a Canada hat.  I'm thinking maybe you moved to Canada.  No, no, no, no.  I just kind of was running back and forth on the road, but I had to come in and see you  guys.  Look at this.  Cool.  I know.  It's beautiful.  Nothing has changed.  Nothing has changed at all.  I just went to take a leak and there was a huge surprise outside.  There's like four or five animals that are on steroids, it looks like. 
[02:20:00]  Really?  Animals.  Really?  What are they?  And then at least ten girls, a few of them are on some kind of substance that I couldn't  recognize.  I mean, just out of their minds, but very hot, right?  A couple?  You didn't think?  Oh, they don't pass Eric's standards?  Are you insane?  What's wrong with these girls?  They're much better than the usual messes we've had.  Is the sound on out there?  Is this going to reen it?  There's a few that are cute. 
[02:20:30]  Just the rest, like you said, the rest of them are just a mess.  The rest?  How many other?  There's a lot.  There's a bunch of them.  There could be close to...  How has the satellite chicks been?  Since you moved to satellite, has there been an interest?  Ah, there's still messes that we have to believe look good.  Really?  Yeah.  It's the same old crap.  But now you've got to say this.  But there have been a couple of really hot ones.  That's right.  It's up to the listeners to figure out which ones were the hot ones.  So if you've been in here, you can go, oh, that was me.  I was the one of the hot ones.  Right.  What are they, strip club girls?  These are probably strip club bouncers.  Is that who they are?  Are they? 
[02:21:00]  All I know is it's a party.  There's a party going on in the hallway.  Yeah, the last party we had in here was so successful.  Ten mediocre hardcore lesbians beats two hot girls doing like next to nothing.  You know, Joe is absolutely right.  That is true.  It all depends on what they want to do.  You could have hot...  We've had hot, hot girls sit on that couch and do nothing.  Eric.  And left, and we were very disappointed.  Why don't either Ben or Eric do the pre-interview and see what they want to do today?  And see if any of them have a fist-sized bulge.  Don't promote them yet.  I'm not going to promote them yet.  I saw you looking at their business cards. 
[02:21:30]  Good, promote me.  I'll be in Denver for New Year's.  I like how Ben is snapping back at Opie like that.  That's good.  You don't take that from him.  That's good.  I saw you reach for the card.  I thought you were going to...  You got a lot of balls, Ben.  You got it here.  This is for you.  For you.  For you.  You're going to let him talk to you like that, Opie?  What is the world coming to?  The guy who owns the business...  He's a rat.  His whole family are rats.  You got a problem with what I did, Anthony?  I got no fucking lime. 
[02:22:00]  You're going to dig the hole.  I never dug a hole before.  I'll be the last.  The guy that owns the business promised a nice lesbian couch session in order for a plug  for his business.  All right.  What kind of business is it, Ben?  It obviously has something to do with steroids because these guys are animals, man.  You know how you make fun of my yawning?  I'll just go tell them what you said, and then we can be even.  Find out if any of the girls have little skimpy bikini bottoms with a large, just feminine...  Eric, you know, beef.  Yeah. 
[02:22:30]  Look like Mick Jagger's face.  Eric, stashing two knockwursts down her pants.  Find out what they're going to do.  You like that clown lift?  You got to do lesbian coach?  No.  More than I like often.  No, hold on.  Really?  Yeah.  Hold on.  We want specifics.  Exactly what are they going to do?  And they're going to go...  They'll say, we'll do anything.  Yeah, anything isn't a specific.  Find out where they're going to be while we're in Vegas.  Not only that.  Find out if there is complete nudity.  That's the first and foremost, most important thing.  Because some girls get in here, and it takes 10, 15 minutes just to see if they're going 
[02:23:00]  to get naked.  We want to know if they're going to get naked.  That's right.  We don't want to have to sit here and beg like we have our whole lives.  And turn them against each other, too.  I'll do this.  Well, I'll do this.  Oh, make them outbid each other.  That's it.  Yeah, definitely.  Definitely.  I need anal.  Give me anal.  Give me anal, anal, anal.  And will any of them drop a log?  Just throw that in.  Just in case.  All right.  You never know.  We're in the middle of the show at someone's apartment.  Yeah.  We're in the middle of hooker tips with Jim Norton.  We've got to do a couple more here.  It's Matt.  What's up, Matt? 
[02:23:30]  Matt.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  What's up?  Hi, Matt.  Hi, Pumpkin.  How are you doing?  Thanks for calling the program.  Thank you.  Hey, Norton, I had a bad experience.  I used to hook up with a girl through, like, a chat line.  I was wondering if you ever ran a follow-the-law because I got arrested meeting a girl in a hotel.  Never.  I'm very, very careful about what I say and where I go.  Even when I would drive around and pick them up, I would never.  If they would say, what do you want to do?  I would never say, I want to have sex.  If I ever got suspicious, just I would always say, hey, get in the car. 
[02:24:00]  Let's go for a ride.  We'll just chat.  And if they go, no, because a cop will never get in the car, I'll go, okay, take care.  Have a good night.  Uh-huh.  I passed up probably a few legit ones.  Mm-hmm.  Always be.  Rather err on the side of caution, man.  You got to be really careful.  Wow.  What did they say in the hotel?  What did you get arrested for?  You must have said something when you showed up, like, here's the money.  Well, no.  What happened was I had met her.  Here's the money.  Suck my cock.  Yeah.  But you're right.  I'm going to bang you hard now.  No.  I had met this girl a couple times before off a chat line, and I met her on there again, 
[02:24:30]  and she's like, come on to this hotel.  What do you want to do?  What are you going to do to me when you get there?  So I start telling her all this stuff.  Okay.  And I'm so frigging stupid that the other two hotels had, like, outside rooms,  so I could see.  This one, I actually had to walk into the hotel and walk through.  And I walk by the door, and I hear guys talking inside.  So being there, she said, I had to actually take my cell phone out and call the room  because she gave me the room number.  And she answers the phone, and I'm like, are you actually there? 
[02:25:00]  She's like, oh, yeah, come on in.  So I knock on the door, and, like, three doors open,  and about seven cops push me in the room and sit down.  And after my pocket, it was just humiliating.  Ouch.  You got to be, you got to be, you got to be, well, you know what I do?  Sometimes this works in the street.  I'm talking to a girl, and she's like, what do you want to do?  And I'm like, I don't know, man.  I'm kind of like an amateur photographer.  Just take some pictures or something.  Oh.  What's illegal about taking pictures?  That's not sex.  And if they know what the deal is, once they're in the car,  and I'll kind of play, how do I know you're not a cop? 
[02:25:30]  Just joke.  If they grab you a mule, then it's like, all right, look, this is what I want.  Yeah.  But I never say it through the car window.  That car one is very good where you told the people, once they get in the car, you know,  hey, let's go for a ride.  Let's go for a ride and talk for a little bit.  Because, you know, cops won't get in the car with you, will they?  Absolutely not.  No, they can't.  And he says it with that twinkle in his eye.  Yeah.  Just go for a ride.  Of course.  I'll never forget this one girl.  It was so hot.  But there was a taxi cab parked by, and cops used cabs.  And I just got a bad vibe.  I'm like, go away, stupid.  So I'm like, yeah, take care.  And sometimes you just got a chance to, you know, don't be stupid. 
[02:26:00]  Have you ever been arrested?  No.  Not that I can't ever be arrested, but I'm very careful.  I'm not careless.  I don't take it for granted.  I'm not a dummy.  But he's been with, like, a crap load of these girls.  Yeah, but he's got, like, spidey sense.  He does.  He's got hooker sense.  Spidey sense.  It just tingles.  And I'll pass up a real one before I'll pick up a bad one.  You know what I mean?  Like, I'm so cautious and so paranoid about what I, one time I was talking to this whore.  Holy crap, there's always a one time.  I mean, I'm loving it, but the one time never ends with this guy. 
[02:26:30]  Dude, I'm talking to a whore.  I'm like, hey, baby, you want to go for a ride?  We'll hang out.  And she's just glaring at me.  And I realize that my passenger window is down, and there's two detectives in a car sitting right there, listening to everything I'm saying.  So this hooker is staring at me like, just shut your mouth.  You ass.  And I look at the cop, and he goes, I know.  You need directions to the tunnel.  Get out of here.  You ass.  Confidence sense of humor.  I love that.  That was close.  That was close.  But I hadn't said anything, I guess, completely incriminating.  That's hilarious. 
[02:27:00]  I wish I did not have a conscience.  I got guilt, because I could never do that.  I would be so petrified.  What?  Well, I got a girlfriend, so I can.  You're a hot girl.  It's worth it, though.  It's different if you're happy in your relationship.  Right.  There is making that move, though, where even if you don't have a girlfriend or anything, just making the move to prostitution.  It's kind of a big, you don't understand, Jimmy.  It's a big milestone.  God bless you, fearless warrior.  Yeah.  For a normal, average guy that's never done it before, that first time has got to be a little petrifying. 
[02:27:30]  How old were you?  19 years old.  The first time I ever did it, I was sober.  I told this girl, I couldn't believe I was actually going to do it.  Were you with friends?  No, I never did that alone.  I did once or twice, like, years later, but I never went for the, you know, group of guys.  Yeah.  Just me alone.  Oh, the bachelor party.  You're serious.  Yeah, please.  Yeah, I didn't like that whole, hey, let's laugh together.  It was like, just beat it, stupid.  I want to get sucked off and just be alone.  Let's laugh together.  Yeah, enough of that.  All right, let's say how to the Gooch in Cleveland.  Gooch!  What's up, fellas?  Hey. 
[02:28:00]  Hey, fat tits.  Hey, Gooch, how's that snow?  Oh, it's fantastic.  Told you, do something for every state that calls in.  I'll have something really funny and clever to say.  I'm excited about it.  I had an awful first hooker experience.  Found this chick on the internet.  One got lost on the way to her house.  The internet?  On the intranet.  Okay.  The internet is for...  Hookers.  For news.  Fat hookers, apparently.  News.  No, the internet is for...  Wait.  For meeting people?  Stock quotes?  Email?  The internet is for...  Email.  Email. 
[02:28:30]  Buying.  Sending pictures to your grandma?  Things on Amazon.  The internet is for...  You can make a map.  Knowledge.  Internet is for...  Ah!  That's right.  Internet is for...  Scratch.  Walk me up all night.  Hugging me.  Horn to thorn.  Thorn.  Thorn.  Thorn.  Is that awful thing stuck in your head?  All right.  Go ahead, Gooch.  When I got to her place, the first thing I saw when I pulled in was all her kids' toys  scattered about the lawn.  Hot.  She comes to the door.  She's 5'2", 180. 
[02:29:00]  Just awful and fat.  And we got up to her room.  I couldn't even get a hard-on.  Of course.  She was sitting there blowing me, talking about Brett Favre.  She was a huge Green Bay fan, and she talked about Brett Favre.  Oh, I'm a cheese head.  I'm giving you cheese head.  Punch it out, fellas.  That's awful.  All right.  One or two more, and then we got to move on to something else.  What is this?  George in Colorado.  What's up, George?  Hey, guys. 
[02:29:30]  Adam Ferrara is going to be in Denver for New Year's Eve.  Yeah.  Come on.  Just drive around until you find the place.  Oh!  Adam has no idea about all the inside gags yet.  You're going to have to start hanging around more.  Go ahead, George.  Hey, Jimmy.  Ever go down to New Mexico?  No.  I've never been there, but I'd love to.  I will give you a warning if you go down there.  Do not call any of the escort services in the Albuquerque or Santa Fe area.  Why?  They're either all rip-offs or you're jacking yourself. 
[02:30:00]  Yeah, I hate agencies.  Well, I'll tell you, a lot of them aren't even agencies.  There was one.  I was staying in New Mexico.  The trucking company I used to work for, I was down there every other week.  And sometimes I'd get down there two or three days and I'd call one.  And I called this one in the agency and said, well, that's between you and the girl.  Of course.  And it was a $100 fee just for her to come out.  Yep. 
[02:30:30]  And she showed up and she said, well, it's $125 for everything.  And I said, all right, that sounded decent to me.  So I gave her $100 and a quarter and ended up jacking myself.  Jacking yourself?  Why?  Because it was $125 on top of the $100, right?  Right.  Yeah.  And she said, well, New Mexico, the state of New Mexico, we're not, you know, she said,  we can get in trouble, period.  And I just looked at her and I said, get the fuck out of here.  When it's just, you know, it's like, I mean, she was giving me this little strip tease and  whatnot. 
[02:31:00]  And then, and, and she wouldn't even come near me.  And I said something to her and she's like, oh, well, we're not allowed to do that.  We can get in a lot of trouble.  I said, well, then what the fuck did I just give you $100 and a quarter for?  Yeah.  So you gave her a hundred and a quarter total, right?  I'd make it clean the house or something.  Yeah.  Do something.  I was pissed off at her and I told her I wanted my money back.  Forget it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And she's like, no, you ain't getting shit back.  And she picked up the phone.  She was going to call her driver.  And because I had to give him the agency fee and she grabbed her, picked up her phone, 
[02:31:30]  went to call her driver and I took the phone away from her.  And I said, I want my fucking money back.  I said, if I got it, I said, if all I'm going to do is jack myself, I said, hell,  I said, I might as well have not even called you.  Yep.  You should have jacked yourself and then taken a handful of it like Silence of the Lambs  and thrown it at our face.  Yeah.  Like multiple Migs.  Right.  Like Migs.  I mean, there was no way in hell I was letting her out of there.  And so she gave me some of my money back.  She gave me like, I think she gave me like 75 back. 
[02:32:00]  But I'll tell you, I got ripped down there once.  I called an agency in Albuquerque and they said it was a businessman special, two girls for  300 bucks for two hours.  This guy is just the hooker loser guy.  So what happened?  What happened?  They showed up.  The two chicks showed up with their driver.  I gave the guy the 300 bucks and he went back down to the car and the two girls were  there and I was staying in a fairly nice hotel and the one chick walks into the bathroom,  comes back out two seconds later and she goes, oh, we can't do anything. 
[02:32:30]  It's my time of the month.  Say, who cares?  And I just looked at her and I said, so?  I said, you got an ass.  Should have said you were into crime scene sex.  Right.  Did she drink out of your mule at least?  Yeah.  The other one gave me a blow job, but even then you could tell she wasn't into it.  And I was like, they left and when I got down to the lobby to check out the next morning,  the night desk clerk, he says, what was the agency you called? 
[02:33:00]  And I just looked at him.  And he says, yeah.  He says, because they stopped to ask your room number when they came in.  And he says, and I just told him, and he says, be very careful.  He says, that agency, he says, they are known rip-offs in this area.  And I talked to an Albuquerque device cop about a month later.  And he was telling me that they have, he says, they get so many guys called and said they've  been ripped off by an agency down there.  How do you call and say you've been ripped off?  You wanted the massage and she just took the money and left.  You could always call that.  Yeah.  Why not? 
[02:33:30]  But then again, she'll lie.  She could lie and go, he hit me.  Yeah.  All she's got to do is say, he hit me, he pushed me, and then you're arrested.  They have to arrest you.  Jimmy, have you ever seen a magazine called The Great American Sex Guide?  No.  It's a national publication that lists like, you know, Asian massage parlors and the strip clubs.  You guys are almost as despicable as you are, Jimmy.  This guy is almost.  I know.  He's a pig and a reader.  But he's like the opposite end of the Jimmy spectrum where Jimmy is safe and knows what 
[02:34:00]  he's doing and is a seasoned pro.  This guy is just tripping through, skipping through life with his shoelaces on time.  Running willy-nilly with an erection and 50 bucks in his hand.  Running, banging into cops with his cock.  I called this girl, she had a dick.  Yeah, I was waiting for that story.  Yeah, and plus whatever he has to say.  Oh.  I go to all these Asian massage parlors.  They're awful.  Yeah.  Well, some of them are.  It depends.  I mean, the place that I go to on a rink, I go to like once a month and I actually write  it off on my taxes at a medical expense because I do a massage too. 
[02:34:30]  Dude, Dennis from the Bunny Ranch took me to get one like three weeks ago when he was  in New York.  It was like a $50 special.  Dennis knows all these places.  And I get up there and it's like a really cool scene but I'm kissing the girl's shoulder  and I could smell the breath of the guy before.  I swear to God.  Gay.  Totally gay.  No, it's not gay.  It just stunk.  It turned me off.  You know that breath smell when somebody licks skin?  I could smell it on her shoulder.  Yum.  Yeah.  Yeah, but there's a couple of places out here in Colorado that I've gone to that, 
[02:35:00]  I mean, they take pride in keeping the place clean and keeping the girls clean.  I mean, you go in there.  They hose them down after you're done.  Right.  Here's a little rule for the grubber hole.  Here's a little rule.  You can only talk to me about hookers once you've gone through what I've gone through  and had one stink up your bathroom.  Once that's happened, you can call in.  I had one excuse herself.  She was gone too long and I'm like, I know what she's doing.  And she walked out and the telltale sign, she closed the door behind her. 
[02:35:30]  I'm like, who do you think you're dealing with?  Really?  Sneaky Pete, you?  Of course you knew.  Yeah, it stunk.  Couldn't hold it in.  Coke.  Pride doing coke.  Oh.  What's that?  Jimmy, you and I could probably spend three or four hours talking to the hookers.  Yeah, and I hope we do.  Thank you, George.  George, thank you, thank you.  That's George from college.  I interrupt this program to bring you the Ozone Midget Sighting of the Day.  Whoa, who saw this coming, Anthony?  Oh, Midget Sighting.  Who's this? 
[02:36:00]  Hello.  Hello.  Hey, who are you?  This is Julie.  It's a girl.  A girl.  We love girls.  I'm not calling about prostitutes, though.  Oh.  What are you calling about?  Well, they were going to put me through as a Midget Sighting.  Oh, we got a smart one on the line.  Okay, let's go, Julie.  Hence the intro.  I was in the grocery store on Christmas Eve, and I was watching a Midget grocery shop with  the little shopping carts that they have for you to bring your kids with, using the 
[02:36:30]  miniature shopping cart, because it was too small to actually see above the other normal  ones.  Of course.  Did you have to help?  Did people have to help?  Like, hey, could you grab that up for me over there?  Hey, could you grab that for me?  You have to wonder, because how the hell do they reach all the way up there?  All they could reach is the bulk rice that's on the bottom shelves of all the supermarkets.  And dog food.  Yeah, dog food and rice.  Crawl into there and just eat, stupid.  Because their little fingers won't grab, you know?  Yeah, they can't even grab anything big.  What if they need one of those big, round tomato sauce cans? 
[02:37:00]  Or a bag of charcoal.  Those disgusting nubs they call fingers, those Vienna cocktail franks, just trying to wrap  around there.  Oh, and those little deformed arms, trying to pick it up and heave it into the cart, just  slipping out.  Watch it, doesn't hit that little size three foot.  Oh, just a mess.  What was the biggest item he picked up?  You know, I saw him at the very beginning. 
[02:37:30]  He was standing in the produce section, so, I don't know, you know, standing over by  the bananas or something.  All right.  Thank you, Julie.  You're welcome.  Meanwhile, back at the show.  Anyway, uh...  It's funny, the midges.  He's log rolling a watermelon up to the front stairs.  Yes.  We're having a bun at you.  Awful excuses for life.  Those little things.  Where's Eric?  Are we going to get the update from the girls?  And what they're going to do today?  Oh, they're probably filling out the ten volumes of paperwork that they have to fill 
[02:38:00]  out.  You got lesbian paperwork?  And then, of course, they have to go through Master Poe trying to pick him up.  What?  Yeah.  No, that's what we're hearing.  He likes to hit on the women that come through here.  He likes to hear.  Look, everyone's nodding.  Everyone's nodding.  We were the ones that didn't know because we're in here.  Right.  But everybody that hangs out out there, they know what goes on.  They get the smooth talking Master Poe.  He has a good line, though.  He says, look, give me your number or I'll rip your arm out of socket, bitch. 
[02:38:30]  I kind of like.  Yeah, Adam, they hired a trained assassin to watch out for us.  Really?  Security now?  He's our secretary slash killer.  Is it the guy?  Master Poe.  He's like a legit, like, triple whatever it is, black belt.  To the ninth degree.  Ridiculous.  Did you see that?  He's the gatekeeper.  Yeah.  And one day he came in after he threw a bloody gi into a dumpster, and he's claiming that it was because his dog got injured,  and we weren't asking any other questions after that. 
[02:39:00]  Did you see the article that he has hanging up in his office cubicle security area there?  Yeah.  What, Ben?  Poe's, you know.  Is he working?  Poe's, yeah.  Poe's always working.  He's working at it, too.  Or he blew up his spot.  We said when you left.  I heard that.  I heard it in Steve's studio.  He's got an article of how he was training people down in D.C.  Guantanamo Bay as well he did.  Yeah, in Guantanamo and, like, the CIA center down there in D.C., training him to kill. 
[02:39:30]  Like, they subcontract him.  Outsourcing?  To teach assassins for the CIA how to kill people.  And he's our security guy.  Ben, just laughing.  All right, Ben, relax.  He is the nicest guy in the world that will kill you in a heartbeat.  Yeah, well, that's just it.  The nicest guy in the world.  Always a smile.  Always nice.  But he would kill you in a heartbeat.  And, yeah, if something turned, though, it's over Johnny.  He'd kill you.  Opie looks forward to his handshake every day.  You want to get into that? 
[02:40:00]  Well, I don't like being touched in the morning.  And Master Poe has a thing he does when he gets here.  And I don't like it.  Master Poe is a man full of ritual, Opie.  Yes.  He's very ritualistic.  Everything he does in life is some type of ritual.  And one of the rituals...  Master Poe.  Hey, Master Poe.  There he is.  There he is.  Nothing's going to ever keep you down.  You're the best.  Master Poe.  He's making a rare appearance on the program, Anthony. 
[02:40:30]  I know.  Oh, wait for your theme music, Master Poe.  Nothing's going to ever keep you down.  There he is.  Master Poe in studio.  Hey, how are you guys?  Good.  What's going on?  Well, we started out with 9,000 women, and they were all beautiful, and went down to three.  Why?  Well, unfortunately, they didn't come down with identification.  Three we have now?  How do people walk around life...  Without ID.  Without ID.  They had no ID.  No ID.  And they said, no, I promise you, I'm 21, I'm 25. 
[02:41:00]  I believe some of them...  No ID.  Do some of them look 21?  I don't care.  No, no, I'm just saying, do they look 21?  No?  No ID.  Oh.  No ID.  Can we at least look at them?  Like, through the glass?  Parade them across the glass.  They were willing to do many things, but...  Just parade them in front of the glass so we can see what they look like.  Unfortunately, because of the no ID thing, some of them left.  Angry.  Jesus Christ.  Oh, my God.  Gotta do it.  You gotta do it, though.  We understand the rules.  I know.  But they could have paraded in front of the glass so the people that are doing the show 
[02:41:30]  could have seen and assessed the situation.  Do we have three goers, at least?  We have three goers.  All right.  And what are they gonna do, Eric?  Warlords.  Will they touch my you-know-what?  And, Eric, are these the three that you were referring to earlier in your conversation  in here?  One of them is, yeah.  Two of them will get completely naked.  The third one is ragging right now, so she can't get...  Look, I don't care if the couch ends up looking like...  It doesn't matter to me. 
[02:42:00]  Crime scene.  That's it.  We'll buy a slip cover.  Next.  I don't care.  Why do people care?  Jim cares.  I don't care.  I don't care if it looks like Lizzie Borden's parents' bed.  I don't care if it looks like Abe Lincoln's pillow after the show.  I don't care if Dennis Fung is picking change out of the cushions.  Wow.  All right.  Dennis Fung.  Ha-ha, sports fans.  Ha-ha.  We'll get him in next.  All right.  Oh, I don't care if it looks like Mo Green's massage table. 
[02:42:30]  It doesn't bother me.  Just get on and let her rip.  Hold the cord.  That's right.  Stand in the door.  That got me off the hook.  I'm glad.  Yes.  Oh, yeah.  What happened?  He's gone now.  Nothing.  We were this close to settling the handshake.  Nothing, man. 
[02:43:00]  This close.  Everything's good.  I like it.  I don't mind it.  We're all happy here.  We're all happy.  Didn't get to play him leaving the studio.  All right.  Why don't we break?  We'll get the girls in next for plugs for some guy's business.  How do we go from 20 girls to three?  I'm sure all those steroid freaks had their IDs, though, right?  Yeah.  So there'll be 20 of those guys wandering around.  I'll tell you how we went from 20 to three.  Day before Thanksgiving.  Well, okay.  All right.  Well, you have a good point.  We would have bent the rules earlier.  Good for Master Paul and good for Ben. 
[02:43:30]  You know, Ben, good for putting their feet down.  Oh, how many foundry music chat people or message board people are going to go,  Oh, O&A lost it, man.  In the old days, they'd have brought in 15-year-old chicks and shoved a bat up their ass.  But they lost it.  They're pussies now.  Yeah, okay.  How about we do it at your house so you could go to jail, you fucko?  Yeah, that's right.  I said fucko.  Oh, Captain Fucko. 
[02:44:00]  But none of them said that.  You're getting mad thinking they might say that.  Yeah, what's wrong with you, dude?  But they didn't say that.  Calm down.  I hear things.  Okay.  They're hearing things?  I hear things.  Yeah, all of a sudden, you know, we're pussies because we don't want to take barbed wire Louisville  sluggers and shove them up underage girls' assholes.  We kind of want to...  Not like we don't want to.  We can't.  We just want to keep our jobs for a while.  Yeah.  Let us get a year into this before we really start screwing it up.  You kind of learn things when you get kicked off the radio for time.  Right.  Do you know how many times I've run over in my head?  What would have happened if you were going to that phone call if I had just jumped up 
[02:44:30]  and said no, no?  Even if you would have went to it anyway, it would have changed things.  Even if you would have been pissed and said I wrecked the show.  Faggot, you ruined the show.  Absolutely.  For two years you go over that.  Like, why did you just wreck the bed?  You know how cool it would have been to have a couple to have sex at St. Pat's and we  blew it.  We weren't able to do it.  Because Jim was a pussy.  Yeah.  Do you honestly think we would have still been working there?  No, no, no, no.  But I'm saying screw it up.  Yeah, it would have been absolutely been something else.  But you know what I'm saying, it's like you go over things and you're like, sometimes  this could have a shower on our way out.  At least you did it on the air. 
[02:45:00]  Look, we found some stuff on your hard drive.  Yeah, yeah.  Wow.  Good thing.  Good thing I drilled holes in that thing.  Did you really?  Demagnetized it.  I had my hard drive from my first computer sitting up on my desk for a while using it  like a paperweight and everyone was asked, why are there holes in it?  Why does it look like it was beaten with a hammer?  You can see some of the things people email me.  How do you demagnetize it?  And then I download and gawk at.  You use a bulker, a cart bulker.  It's used to erase magnetic tape.  And oh, hi, look, they're in front of the window. 
[02:45:30]  Some of the girls.  Some of the girls.  Oh, there's three.  Ooh.  Wow.  Wow.  She's not wearing a brassiere.  I'll say.  All right.  Swim this way, little fish.  Oh, that's the one that is really whacked.  Who's the guy with the cell phone?  Very nice.  Hey, how you doing, huh?  Wow, these girls are nice.  Holy shit.  Wow.  Yeah, look at, I told you, look at these.  I saw this guy in the.  Look at these animals and look at these beautiful women.  Nice.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, we're going to.  That one on the end is very.  We're going to do okay after all. 
[02:46:00]  Look at the front of the.  Yeah, I see that.  I love that.  It's great.  The supporting cast of The Sopranos is here with them.  Who's that guy?  Hey.  Take your fucking pop.  Take your tits out.  Take your tits out.  They're topless now and they're.  Altry nude women.  There we go.  Hey, yeah.  These girls are goers.  All right.  All right.  Who wants to play?  Which one has their period?  I just figured it out.  Anybody else?  I don't think much.  The one who I'm in love with on the end?  Anybody else?  Yeah, that girl does with the breasts out.  How much money do you want to bet?  I don't want to bet any money because I hope I'm wrong.  I guarantee the girl with the period is the one on the left. 
[02:46:30]  The tall blonde.  You think?  Right there.  Why are you saying that, Opie?  Because I'm a smart guy.  Is it the red spot on her white jeans?  Is she a string?  It was how she pulled down her little panties.  Oh, it wasn't the full pull down.  Ben, have the girl that's on her period raise her hand.  Anybody else want to guess?  Let's get a monkey to snow.  We have the tall blonde on the left.  We have the cafe latte in the middle and the short blonde with the really big implants 
[02:47:00]  on the right.  Let's see.  Okay, who's got their, Opie says it's the one on the left.  Who's got the tide going out?  What?  Okay, you want to know who did, did you want to bet anybody or are you?  Yeah, just have the girl raise her hand and is having her period.  Wow, Opie!  Very good.  Opie, wow.  I'm glad I was wrong.  And this is through soundproof and smellproof glass.  Yeah.  You got to pay attention to women.  That's my tip of the day.  Got to pay attention.  You can write the foreword to the hooker book. 
[02:47:30]  That's right.  Had to tell who's on her period.  Very good.  Very good.  All right.  Why don't we take a quick break and we'll see what these ladies are about next.  And what's up with this Bernie Getz email?  We'll read it next.  All right?  But in honor of the hooker tips today, it's an old O&A classic.  Oh, yes.  Another story.  Good afternoon.  Hi.  Um, I'm going to be in the Nevada area in about a week.  Uh-huh.  I got your pleasure menu. 
[02:48:00]  Could you hold on a minute?  Mm-hmm.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I have Tourette's syndrome, which makes it hard to communicate.  Oh, no problem.  Okay.  You need prices, hon?  Yes.  Okay.  Well, house minimum starts at $100.  That's for a basic one activity party.  A hundred.  Wow, that's pretty cheap. 
[02:48:30]  That's where the prices start.  And then from there, the sky's the limit because all the ladies are independent contractors.  You don't think the girls would mind being with a guy with a...  That's no problem, hon.  Handicap's no problem.  Oh, good.  Good.  So I could come down and, you know, get a girl and climb aboard and start going...  Well, you have to come in and discuss that with the lady. 
[02:49:00]  Oh.  Okay.  So for a hundred bucks, could I put my head between her...  Could I do that?  Yeah, I'm not allowed to discuss that on the phone.  You have to discuss that with the lady, okay?  Oh.  I just want to warn you that when I get in the room and things get hot and heavy, I  could get a little wild, you know, when I get...  Is that okay?  That's no problem, hon.  Do you take...  Mastercard? 
[02:49:30]  Yes, we do.  Could I bring a muzzle so I don't clamp down on anything I shouldn't?  That's fine.  Do you think a girl would mind if...  When I start...  She spanks me.  You have to come in and discuss with the lady.  Are they pretty women?  Very pretty.  This might sound...  It's worth your time, okay?  This might sound like a strange request, but...  Do you have any...  Girls that aren't that attractive, babe? 
[02:50:00]  All of our ladies are very nice.  I have...  Jungle fever?  Do you have any...  Black girls?  We have black ladies.  We have Asian ladies.  We have Oriental ladies.  It just depends.  I have to go now because I'm very busy, okay?  Do you have any...  Do you have a dwarf?  No, we don't.  Not at this time.  Because I saw a dwarf in a movie once and it made me...  Goodbye, okay? 
[02:50:30]  But wait...  Well, you know, I've heard a lot of radio over the years.  This is probably the worst.  Way back in the middle 60s, there was a small station outside of Moline, Illinois.  I believe it was WRCW.  Not sure of the call letters.  1590 Daytimer.  Signed off at Sunrise.  Sunset rather.  They were pretty bad. 
[02:51:00]  They were pretty, pretty darn bad.  But this is probably worse.  I got bummed to Opie and Anthony.  The Opie and Anthony show.  It's not just for you.

I don't understand anything, so there you go.  You know my problem?  I watch too much news, man.  That's my problem.  That's why I'm so depressed all the time.  I figured it out.  I watch too much CNN, man.  I don't know if you've ever sat around and watched CNN longer than, say, 20 hours in  one day.  I don't recommend that.  Watch CNN headline news for one hour. 
[02:53:30]  It's the most depressing thing you'll ever fucking do.  War, famine, death, AIDS, homeless, recession, depression.  War, famine, death, AIDS, homeless.  Then you look out your window.  Where's all this shit happening?  Ted Turner's making this shit up, man.  Jane Fonda won't sleep with him.  He runs to a typewriter.  By 1992, we will all die of AIDS. 
[02:54:00]  Read that on the air.  I don't get laid.  No one gets laid.  I'm writing, Jane Fonda.  Will you fuck this guy so we can get some good news, please?  I want to see a well-laid Ted Turner newscast.  Hey, it's all going to work out.  Here's sports.  This is the nicest part of the South, for sure, man.

You go to, like, Mississippi motherfuckers behind in your car and shit.  Shit, boy.  This is nice here.  It's too hot, bro.  This ain't no place to be in, like, July, and shit. 
[02:55:00]  The fuck out of here, man.  It's hot every day.  90 degrees, and shit.  It's, like, hotter than 10 niggas in a Volkswagen, and shit.  Hello, exactly. 
[02:55:30]  Spider-bait doing Black Betty.  Phenomenal version.  Oh, yeah.  Really fast before we get the ladies in here, and the animals that escorted them to the show  today.  Animals.  They look like animals, right?  Big boys.  They're very big boys. 
[02:56:00]  Ben's new friend, Bernie Goetz, wrote him an email.  This is Ben's new buddy.  His newest, bestest buddy.  Funny.  Bernie Goetz, the subway vigilante that tried to kill four black people on the subway.  My buddy, my buddy, wherever I go, he shoots four black guys, my buddy.  And now they're friends.  Bernie wants Ben to come over to smoke some dope and drink with him, and maybe even go  out to eat. 
[02:56:30]  Get a bite.  See his squirrel, his pet squirrel.  Yeah.  Dude, you have to go over there.  You do.  You'll give us a half hour of great radio.  Take one for the team.  What's in his apartment and things like that.  How everything is adjusted because he's got such OCD.  You know, everything's got to be lined up perfectly, I bet.  Yeah.  You know, we should, I would take one for the team.  I would do lunch with Bernie, even though he hates me.  And then we'll record the whole thing like Andy Kaufman did with, what's his name there?  Bob Zermuda, probably.  No, no, no, no.  The wrestler.  The wrestler. 
[02:57:00]  Yeah.  Lawler?  The pencil neck geek guy.  No, no, no.  It was legendary.  Oh, yeah.  Valentine?  No.  Oh, what's his name?  Oh, yeah.  But Eddie Classy?  Freddie, yeah.  Classy Freddie Blassie.  Yes, exactly.  They sat down and had lunch in a diner and they just taped the whole damn thing.  And it was just surreal and bizarre and very...  Take Bernie babbling.  Yeah, maybe we could do that.  I'm not going to give out Bernie's email address.  Don't do that.  No, no, no. 
[02:57:30]  Don't, because we've got to connect with this guy and you never know when he's going to  decide to start shooting again.  But it should be something else.  Yes.  You know?  Yeah.  That's sort of a weird...  He's got a sort of a weird...  It's a little too cute.  It's sweet.  It's a little too cutesy.  Aw.  I don't know.  It's not racist enough.  Yeah.  It'd be like 38NBlaster at AOL.com or something.  You know, something that...  A little of his history behind it.  Yeah.  He's got a cute little name there. 
[02:58:00]  So, he wrote an email to Ben.  Well, this was one of four that I got today.  Yeah.  Today.  Four.  We're best friends now, man.  Oh, I know.  But, yeah.  No, he doesn't like Opie.  He wants you to be tied to the chair next time he comes in.  Tied to the chair?  Yeah.  He didn't appreciate some of the musical choices Opie was making during his interview here.  During his storytelling.  Opie was playing some racist Southern songs when Bernie was in here.  And perhaps he doesn't want to be aligned with that.  So, what does the email say exactly?  It just says, maybe next time we can ask your security to tie Opie temporarily to his chair. 
[02:58:30]  Be kind of like an appointing of a police department.  Bernie Goetz.  And he also...  He's got music picked out for the next time he's coming in.  He wants to play some songs.  When is he coming in again?  He's going to call in tomorrow.  He had something to do today.  He's got to come in and be a guest DJ.  We'll just sit and watch.  When there's girls here, too.  He's having girls.  It's Bernie Goetz on KTU, baby.  I'm all drunk.  We'll give him a half hour to play his music and say whatever he wants.  What kind of music could a Bernie Goetz possibly like? 
[02:59:00]  Yeah, ask him for some of your selections.  I'm thinking classic rock.  Ask him for some of the selections because you have to run it by the bosses.  Probably anything by Marvin Gaye Sr.  There you go.  I don't think he's a classic rock kind of guy.  ACDC, Shoot to Thrill.  Yeah, he's sort of in that age bracket, although he's kind of geeky, so, you know.  Yeah.  I don't pick him as fast rock. 
[02:59:30]  Hit me with your best shot.  Things like that.  Violent fems.  Adam Ferrara in the studio.  Of course.  New Year's in Denver.  New Year's in Denver.  Where, though?  Comedy Works, Larimer Square.  All right, good, good, good.  All right, let's get these animals in here.  I'm missing poor Adam by like a week in Denver.  Yeah, you're going to be in Denver the weekend.  It'll be like the week after.  Crested Butte.  What's Crested Butte?  It's a ski resort.  You're playing at a ski resort?  At Butte Bash.  Sounds like a name.  With the U2 band. 
[03:00:00]  U2 band?  Yep.  Nice.  Holy ass.  Hey, guys.  Holy Jesus.  Don't hurt us.  Stand over here.  What's up?  What's up?  You can't plug yet until the girls do things.  No, no, no, no.  No plugs.  It's fine.  What's up?  We need to close, ladies.  Wow, ladies.  Wow.  Wow, wow, wow.  My word.  Hello.  How are you boys?  We're doing great.  Hello, ladies and gentlemen.  Fantastic.  She's lovely for Pete's sake.  They're very lovely for Long Island girls, too, right?  Uh, New York. 
[03:00:30]  Oh, okay.  Hey, hey, hey, hey.  No, we knew.  We knew.  We were kind of surprised that something like this would be from Long Island.  Right.  It just doesn't happen often.  She's from Long Island.  Huh?  Long Island?  The girl.  Where?  All right, hold on.  Everyone's talking.  Where from?  Where from on Long Island?  What town?  Kings Park.  Kings Park.  Home of the Psychiatric Center.  Yes.  You didn't spend any time there, did you?  Just a little bit.  A little bit?  I don't doubt it.  It's a fine place.  Drive by there and look, and there's bats flying around, belfries. 
[03:01:00]  I swear.  Did you really spend time there?  No, okay.  Oh, okay.  You never know.  I mean, it's a hangout, but.  It's a hangout.  Yeah, kids would hang out at the loony bins on Long Island.  Long Island's a very weird place because at night, as you're growing up, you'd have to  find places to hang out, and it's so residential that there's few places for kids to hang out,  so it would be like church parking lots and Kings Park Psychiatric Center.  You'd have to find your own, make your own fun, right?  Yeah, I understand.  And how old are you? 
[03:01:30]  21.  21.  21.  What do you do for a living?  I'm a dancer.  You're a dancer.  You dance on Long Island?  Yes.  What are some of the places?  Long Island Knockouts.  Ooh.  That's it.  That's it?  Yeah.  Exclusive.  Yes.  You're not one of those afternoon strippers at some of the places, the local bars on a  Tuesday afternoon.  She's early evening, I think.  Early evening.  All the trade guys walking out, squinting in the sun.  Ugh.  No.  No?  How long have you been dancing, man?  Like two months. 
[03:02:00]  Two months?  Did you start on like open pole night or?  No.  He's a comic, so of course he started an open mic night.  Figures it would be open pole night for the girls.  No.  No?  Did you start right out of high school?  Yes.  Well, no.  Unless you...  Six months after.  Six months after high school?  No.  Six months after I started college.  Yeah?  You decided to start paying for college through dancing?  Yeah.  And then you quit college?  Yeah.  Did you have an audition?  In the back room?  Did you read her book?  Who said that? 
[03:02:30]  Did you have an audition in the...  Did you have an audition for the boss?  Yeah.  What was the interview like?  Right.  Um...  Just filling out paperwork and...  And show your boobs.  Yeah, basically.  Yeah.  Nice.  All right.  And your name?  I'm sorry.  Christy.  Christy or Christy?  Christy.  Christy.  Christy.  And then who do we have next?  I'm Rochelle.  I'm the house mom at VIP.  The house mom?  Yes.  Ooh.  At VIP.  What is the house mom?  I make sure the girls are being legal.  Oh, I hate that.  Oh, you're the buzz kill.  You're the kill joy. 
[03:03:00]  You're the cock block.  Right.  Yes, I am.  And I get paid well to do it.  When the girls want to sneak a little peek and pull that G-string aside...  Because they're a little naughty.  As long as they do it in my house,  in the privacy,  that's fine with me.  Yeah, but what if the guys want to see?  Sometimes some guys wave some cash around and go,  let me see a little something there, you know?  No, that's still for me.  Yeah.  I'm greedy.  And you're the house mom.  Yes, I'm the house mom.  Is that an electoral held...  No, I was hired as management position to take care of my girls. 
[03:03:30]  Do you dance too?  And I take care of them.  No, I don't.  Because you have a really nice body, no?  Thank you.  No dancing.  Not bad for an old bitch.  But anyway...  Oh, can I say that on the air?  No, no, no.  Not at all.  Don't say bitch.  Shit.  What are we going to do?  Bitch is...  Whoopsie.  You really can't.  No, I'm one of the old chicks and I take care of my girls.  But you did dance at some point in your...  Years ago, yes.  Years ago?  How old are you?  You're saying how old you are.  You don't look that old.  37.  That's good.  How's your hip?  Huh?  Very good.  Better than most 18 to 25-year-olds. 
[03:04:00]  Good girl.  Are those lips real?  Yes.  All mine.  Very cool.  Breasts aren't, but the lips are.  Exactly, I paid for them, damn it.  All right.  Lovely.  And Cafe Latte, who is she?  This is my friend Ava.  Ava.  Hey, Ava.  Wow, wait.  This is one of my girls.  Yeah.  At VIP?  I brought her with me, yes.  Wow.  She's one of my girls.  All right, we're going after the show, it looks like.  Yeah.  And how old is Ava?  I'm 26.  26?  Mm-hmm.  Been dancing a while?  Yeah.  Yeah? 
[03:04:30]  Three years.  Very good.  Three years.  Do all right?  Yeah, it's good there.  It's a very good club.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Nice.  Oh, my God.  So back to the animals.  What are these girls going to do for plugs?  Well, look at these guys.  They help us promote Gamma-O, which is our product.  It's Gamma-O.com.  Are you on Gamma-O-O?  Definitely.  Holy ass.  What is Gamma-O?  Gamma-O is a testosterone booster, and the way it works is it's a rice bran extract, so  it's all natural.  And we've done clinical trials, and everyone that's tried it so far, the worst case scenario 
[03:05:00]  is 400% increase in testosterone.  So it's a phenomenal new product.  I don't know if you guys are familiar with pro-hormones and stuff like that.  Look at us.  You think we're familiar with that?  It's big in the news.  I'm a bit like a cancer patient.  Yeah, we're familiar with carbs.  Maguire was taking it, and it's a product that's out on the market.  If you take it, you test positive for steroids.  All right.  They're taking it off the market because of Maguire, and this is going to be the next  answer because it's not a pro-hormone.  It's not bad for you.  It works on your hypothalamus, increases your test. 
[03:05:30]  It's Gamma-O.com.  And you can order it every month.  Then we do trade shows, and we bring the girls with us.  The next trade show we're going to do is the Arnold Classic.  It's the biggest bodybuilding show in the world.  All right.  Very good.  Nice.  All right.  The Arnold Sound Bites.  I think we've got to see them.  Is it Gamma-O or Gamma-O?  It's Gamma-O.com or Gamma-O.com.  Wait, wait.  Get it back to the hot house mom.  Hello.  What are you saying?  It makes you like this. 
[03:06:00]  Rock hard.  It's radio.  Rock hard, baby.  I know.  Shit.  Oh, shoot.  It makes you rock hard.  I think she's better than Viagra.  And if you want to please your woman or your woman and her girlfriends, then get some of  this because you'll be like rock hard all night long.  Rock hard what?  All night long.  You get some of this.  You get some of this.  Instead of like a 10-minute hot on, it goes like for an hour.  It's time now to turn this mush into muscles. 
[03:06:30]  So you have three women instead of one woman.  Very nice.  I'm the party pooper.  Three is definitely always better than one.  It makes you rock hard.  For an hour, though.  What's the use of that?  Oh, dude.  You can go from one to another to another.  I have 58 minutes to kill.  What am I supposed to do with it?  Oh, but then you go back and forth.  You go this one, that one, the other.  Then you go back.  You just have to make shadow puppets after you're done.  And then you change the order.  Then you pay for a full hour. 
[03:07:00]  One pop and you finish.  This way you're getting three chicks for the price of one.  In one hour, you can just go from one to the other, to the other, and then back and  forth.  Just change the direction.  Change the order.  You guys will be good.  And it builds the body up nice and strong.  Yeah, exactly.  It builds the body up.  Makes you hard.  And the cock gets thicker.  You get a dorsal fin.  Your cock's so hard, you could slap somebody with it.  And it gets thicker.  You notice? 
[03:07:30]  Oh, yes.  It does get thicker.  Can I correct you?  One thing, though.  It's always better to slap somebody with a limp cock, because that's just more degrading.  No, no, no, no.  It's better with a hard cock, because then you knock her out.  No, but just a little noodle against the face.  Then you can do what you want.  You knock her out, forget it.  You can do whatever you want.  All right, all right.  So what are you ladies going to do today?  Did we figure this out in the hallway?  No, we never figured it out.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  You guys got to talk into the mic.  No one can hear you.  Why don't you give them some direction?  What's up to us again?  All right.  How about they just get naked and you start from there? 
[03:08:00]  All right.  It looks like that's always a good face.  That is an excellent point.  That was the icebreaker.  Well, point, my maid.  Can we make them undress each other?  Wow.  Yeah, of course.  Holy mackerel.  I'll say.  Your implants are really big.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Oh.  Now we've got some complete nudity.  Sure.  And Steve is filming for opianthony.com and foundrymusic.com.  There we go.  Oh, more clothes coming off. 
[03:08:30]  Always good.  Oh, my goodness.  There we go.  And now more.  And the tall blonde has very natural big boobs.  Very firm.  And the cafe latte has a small set, but very lovely.  Oh, yeah.  Very lovely.  Very lovely.  Ma'am, would it be inappropriate for me to request just seeing your hiney?  Not to be disrespectful?  Oh.  God, is that fantastic.  The house mom is bending over for Norton?  And that's an old lady.  That's really nice.  It's because I use his stuff.  I use that gamma-O. 
[03:09:00]  That's an old lady's ass.  And it's very nice.  That's very nice.  Gamma-O gets you all.  It looks like the balloon knot's been used a few times, huh?  Hey, why are your panties still on?  Because she's the one that's having her period.  Of course I knew the answer to that.  You know what?  You don't want the couch to look like the Jones Beach Causeway, do you?  Look how they massacred my lesbian couch. 
[03:09:30]  I want you to use all your skill and re-upholster this.  I don't want the program director to see it like this.  I don't want his mother to put plastic on it like this.  Yeah, there's some spanking going on.  Jimmy's the king of spanking.  I'm not the king of spanking.  I just enjoy it.  He's like the prince.  He's down for what?  I'm not going to be as good as one of these guys.  Yeah, no, Jimmy, show them how it's done. 
[03:10:00]  Look, they're all bending over for Jimmy.  Jimmy, why don't you move the mic over there?  I want to see one of the gamma-O guys.  Take a fistful of lard and pull a Caligula on her.  Gamma-O-O.  These girls are good pluggers.  Every one of our boys use gamma-O-O-O-O-O.  Okay.  Not through that anymore.  All right, all right.  All right, Jimmy is...  Good thing the product has an O in it. 
[03:10:30]  That kind of works, you know.  All right, ladies.  Good thing the product's not called I have to shit.  That wouldn't be very sexy.  Then it would be like, I have to...  We don't like that.  We like that.  All right.  Ladies, why don't you turn your butts around toward Jimmy?  Okay.  So we can get it on mic.  Whoa.  Wait, what the fuck?  All the girls...  Well, you have to face this way because I'm righty and I have to talk...  No, you have to...  I'm sorry, miss.  I'm sorry.  Pardon me, ma'am.  I don't mean to...  Wait.  No, no, no.  You have to face this way.  What the hell is going on over there?  Is that a knife wound on your boob? 
[03:11:00]  Great spot.  It's fantastic.  Is that a knife wound on her boob?  I don't know, Opie.  That's called implants.  No, not that.  You have to put your little hiney next to the mic, ma'am.  Yeah, here we go.  Oh, Jimmy.  Oh, yeah.  Gamma.  Wow.  Oh, she's liking that.  Eric, mic are better.  May I spank yours?  I won't do it too hard.  Oh, you are fantastic.  Wow.  All right.  Now the cafe latte is getting spanked by Jimmy.  Holy Toledo. 
[03:11:30]  One more.  Jimmy, put your nose out of there.  Jesus, Jimmy.  Jimmy, why don't you just, we got to get Jimmy a miner's helmet.  How far in were you going to go?  Yeah.  I'm sorry.  I'm just, she's a very lovely girl.  Why don't you tell us what you had for lunch now?  I really am peaking.  I apologize.  You weren't just peaking.  I know.  You have a bruise on your third rib.  All right.  Can I?  He was.  I'm sorry.  Oh, no.  Okay.  Yeah, here we go.  The third fine young lady's getting her. 
[03:12:00]  See, that's not too bad, right?  Yeah.  You should have had Bernie Getz in for this one.  We'd have appreciated this.  Is he good, ladies?  He's good?  I'm saying you can't do it too hard.  If you do it too hard, someone yells at you.  She taunted me for my, she felt I should have done it harder.  I have a thing for men with a shaved head.  I can't help it.  She felt I should have done it harder, and she was correct.  Oh, she's, they're all lovely girls, though.  Yeah.  All right.  Very good.  Do you ladies do any tricks or anything?  I do one.  What?  Yeah, what do you do?  It's a handstand with my legs spread. 
[03:12:30]  That's nice.  Well, why don't you do it over here on the console?  You can't, oh, she'll hit the thing.  No, I won't.  No, she won't.  She's a pro.  Hold on, let me get this, miss.  No, no, no.  Oh, my.  Wow.  Holy Toledo.  Jimmy's pointing.  Jimmy left evidence.  Oh, she's doing a split.  All right.  She's right on the show prep.  Is that too hard?  Oh, her head's on the board.  No, it's okay.  Her feet's caught in the thing.  Wow.  Now we're going to, now, now we're having fun. 
[03:13:00]  Look at that.  Her foot is hitting the sound effects.  Hitting various Arnold sound effects.  Hey, Jimmy, you like that, you like that, right?  I can't.  It's big for you, right?  It's beautiful.  It's perfect.  Jimmy likes, uh, Jimmy likes big lips there, so you're, uh.  You're a very lovely girl.  Yeah.  Oh, my God, yes.  My favorite thing.  All right.  Very good.  Very nice.  Who'll visit them?  What?  I thought she should visit each one of you guys.  What'd she turn off?  I think she turned off a bunch of things.  What happened, miss?  Yeah, I think I did.  It's all good.  That's good.  Anyone else do any tricks?  Yeah.  We're on.  I do.  But.  What do you do? 
[03:13:30]  I could, I'm flexible in every way.  I want to see.  All right.  All right.  Well, she's flexible in every way.  And her head around.  I can't.  What are you going to do there?  All right.  Where are you going, ma'am?  I'm going to sit in the middle of the table.  All right.  All right.  She's going to sit in the middle of the table.  Anthony, she's our young stripper with very nice, natural boobs.  What's the scar from on your boob?  I cut myself at work.  Prison fight.  At work?  Yeah.  I kind of cut myself sliding on the pole. 
[03:14:00]  I kind of like.  She's got a pole injury, Anthony.  Yeah.  I never knew there was a pole injury.  I was up at the top, and I kind of like scratched myself on the light.  Oh, on the light.  At the top of the pole.  Yeah.  That looks like it was a nasty one, though.  Yeah, it was.  Yeah.  It's like two weeks old.  Two weeks old.  Like that.  All right.  Very good.  All right.  Let's see what you can do there.  All right.  Oh, wow.  She's putting her leg behind her head.  One leg, the other leg.  Wow.  Wow.  This is coming into a freak show, Anthony.  Both legs are around her head. 
[03:14:30]  Behind her head.  Oh.  Oh, hey.  Be careful.  Hold her back.  Hold her back, Eric.  Help her.  What's wrong with you, Eric?  What happens if you cut a gasser like that?  All right.  She's good, Eric.  The girl with the period has both legs around her head.  I think there's a better description than that you can come up with.  Wow.  That is flexible.  Very nice.  Wow. 
[03:15:00]  All right.  She's very flexible.  We're getting this on camera for everybody, Anthony.  Fold her in half and put her in a trunk.  Very nice.  Very nice.  That was wonderful.  Very sexy.  Very flexible.  Just like she said.  Gamma O does that, too?  Seems like it does everything.  Get gamma O.  All right.  I'm telling you.  Gamma O will do that to your woman.  Is there a pill that will make a woman not want mine that I have fat tits?  They want mine.  You take gamma O.  She takes gamma O.  It don't matter.  Because then you're both a hit and it's lovely.  I was just kidding, but she really plugs. 
[03:15:30]  Oh, she just plugs away.  She's smart.  I have AIDS.  Well, take gamma O.  You can beat up people who'll laugh at you.  The gamma O also works well for females because in a younger female, it increases their testosterone,  which will increase libido.  If you like girls with balls or not.  No, no, no.  Not to that.  See, that's the misconception.  But all women do have testosterone, and when it's boosted a little, it does create a tremendous  amount of sex drive.  Oh.  And then in pre- and post-metapausal women, it helps all the side effects, hot flashes.  Get it for mom.  Are you a science major?  There you go. 
[03:16:00]  He was a science major in college, it looks like.  I'm in the medical field.  Are you really?  Yeah, I am.  I sell surgical supplies.  And knees hit.  Medical field.  I'm in surgery every single day.  I mean, this is the only day I'm not working and I'm not in a surgery.  So I sell hips, prosthetic hips, knees, elbows.  I also sell a post-operative pain pump that infuses a local.  A pain pump.  I'm building a man in the basement.  Pain pump.  Yeah.  So I mean, I've been around the field a long time.  I've been a bodybuilder for a long time.  His uncle is actually a UCLA scientist. 
[03:16:30]  My brother-in-law.  We figured out that if you take gamma-orazinol, that it would help boost all your hormones  for guys and women.  But the problem is getting it from Asia in an extract.  The Japanese is much more potent than the Chinese.  And then if you take it in a powder and you put it into a caplet, your body won't absorb  it.  So we figured out a way by working with some engineers how to make it into an emulsion.  You take an ounce a day.  It comes in a liquid.  32-ounce bottles.  It lasts a month.  You take an ounce a day.  And it boosts your testosterone levels.  What are you saying?  The caplet doesn't dissolve as well like when you take a pill, right?  You just pee it out. 
[03:17:00]  It's like taking too much vitamin C.  This is a liquid.  And what I also thought we would do, we want to send everybody in here a bottle if you guys  are willing to take it.  And I got to tell you, even if you don't work out, you will notice a difference.  And if you don't, you could say on the air you didn't.  But it's not like steroids at all.  It doesn't have any effects.  No, no, no.  You won't test positive steroids.  It's like eating a ton of rice.  The amount of rice that you need to eat, you'd be constipated for weeks if you tried to get  as much Gamma O as you get in one shot.  Well, you're constipated for weeks anyway.  There you go.  Thanks for bringing that up, Anthony. 
[03:17:30]  I really appreciate it.  So, yeah, the Gamma O.com has stuff now for women and for men.  Do the ladies have a grand finale before we leave?  Ladies?  Ladies?  I think it's one of a specific request.  Those cheeks are nice and red.  I was hoping for the lesbian couch.  Well, the couch.  Sure, why not?  If the girls want to get on the couch and go at each other.  Yeah, Eric is pissed off on the phones here. 
[03:18:00]  Let's say hi to Eric and P.  Wow, hold on.  May I say the house mom went right into a little ass-eating.  I've got to say, credit.  Wow.  What a champ.  It's a three-girl daisy chain of butt-eating.  Eric, what's wrong?  It feels so good.  What?  That just sounds so fucking fake, guys.  Come on.  What does?  It feels so good.  Oh, yeah, well, they were moaning fake before.  That was obvious.  They were just playing around.  Yeah, the moaning.  We need a man in between here, in front of my face. 
[03:18:30]  Okay.  To show them how thick and hard it can get.  20 years of marriage.  Thank you, Eric.  How Gamma O.com can get.  I don't think Eric understood that it wasn't like a moaning sexual thing.  She was plugging.  Does anybody want to whip out their hog?  Could you rub his mule?  Oh, don't be shy.  He backed off over there.  Don't be shy.  He got scared.  I'm packing a half right now, or I'd stand there.  You know how nice that would be?  But she'd laugh at me.  Do it.  No, my thing is like Connor Peterson's right now. 
[03:19:00]  Small and wet.  Oh, God.  All right.  All right.  They're kind of making out and feeling better up.  They really are sexy.  That's kind of hot that they're making out after just eating ass.  Ass eating and kissing.  All right.  Very nice.  Yeah.  Very lovely.  How nice and red are those cheeks, huh?  Very red.  You beat them silly.  One little smack.  With that butt.  See the handprint?  I see the handprint.  Oh, a little more spanking going on on the couch.  Oh, yeah.  All three of them on there. 
[03:19:30]  There you go.  Wonderful.  All right, Ant.  Very nice.  Well, we want to thank you guys for coming by today.  Thank you.  See, they know how to get plugs.  That's how you do it.  Thank you, girls.  Bring the girls in.  They perform.  I'm not plugging my product again, but I got to tell you, we have nine other girls out  there, and half of them forgot their IDs.  Yeah, we heard.  And a lot of them were willing to do the Wiffle Ball Bat Challenge, so if you guys want us  back, we'll get IDs and we'll come back another day. 
[03:20:00]  Absolutely.  If they come back with ID, we will...  We'll shove Wiffle Ball Bats up them.  No problem.  Appreciate that.  The problem is, some guys are trying to bring girls who are over 18 in here, and we can't  have that.  Damo.com.  Learning permits or nothing.  All right, let's hear it for the ladies and the guys.  Thank you.  You did a great job.  Thank you.  No problem.  You guys come back.  Maybe you want to raffle off our Gamma-O.com underwear to your listeners if they want them.  Oh, undies. 
[03:20:30]  Undies, and they're nice.  We've only been a little worn for a couple of minutes.  Put them on eBay and give the money to the interns.  Can I see those?  These weren't worn by anybody, were they?  What, are you going to put that on there?  Yes, you were.  Put them on.  Gamma-O.com.  Oh, they were worn.  I was going to give them to somebody, but I...  I think these are mine.  Now they're more valuable.  Yep, these are mine.  They're worth more after they've been worn.  Hey, we're going to go to break.  A little thing that came in a couple months ago.  It's the President of the United States singing Sunday Bloody Sunday.  Remember this thing?  We haven't played it in a while.  Basically, someone took all of the President's speeches, found the lyrics to Sunday Bloody Sunday 
[03:21:00]  by you, too, and came up with this.  There's been a lot of talk about this next song.  This song is not a rebel song.  This song is a rebel song.  I can't believe the news today.  I can't close my eyes and make it go away.  How long, how long must we sing this song? 
[03:21:30]  How long, too, too, too long, for too long?  Tonight?  We can be as one.  Tonight?  Tonight?  Tonight?  Broken bottles under children's feet.  Body's thrown across the dead end streets.  But I won't need the battle call.  It goes my back up, goes my back up.  It's the war.  Sunday Bloody Sunday.  Sunday Bloody Sunday.  Sunday Bloody Sunday. 
[03:22:00]  Sunday Bloody Sunday.  Let's roll.  And the battle's just begun.  There's many lost in people who has won.  The trenches go with their hearts.  Mothers, children, brothers, sisters, horn at heart.  Sunday Bloody Sunday.  Sunday Bloody Sunday. 
[03:22:30]  How long, how long must we sing this song?  How long, too, too, too long, for too long?  Tonight?  We can be as one.  Tonight?  Tonight?  Tonight?  Sunday Bloody Sunday.  Sunday Bloody Sunday.  Sunday Bloody Sunday.  Let's roll.  Anyone who wants more details on my agenda can find them online.  The web address is not very imaginative, but it's easy to remember. 
[03:23:00]  Park, park, not up.  Wipe the tears from your eyes.  Wipe your tears away.  Wipe your tears away.  Wipe your tears away.  Wipe your eyes.  Wipe your watch our eyes.  Sunday Bloody Sunday.  Sunday Bloody Sunday.  Sunday Bloody Sunday.

[03:33:00]  I liked her  I liked she had a nice little body  And a view  Fat little plump area  And then the other girl  Was nodding out  She was on something  That was a little stronger than that  The heroin girl?  Yeah  Considering they were all drinking Red Bulls  Before they got in here  You figure it out  I could do something to it  I could get up here  And go  She was like out of it  And she had some saddle bags working  But you know  Whatever  Why is Celine Dion putting her newborn in a bag  For a photo op?  Let's hope she's in Modesto 
[03:33:30]  Celine Dion is on  Celine Peterson  I am taking a husband  And Kelly  And I guess she has some book out that shows her naked holding her baby in all sorts of poses  It's actually a book of Celine and a bunch of babies  Oh okay  That's the book  And they're posed as like  I don't know  Flowers or something  The babies are part of like flowers  Okay

[03:43:30]  187 on the cover cut.  Any plugs there, Joe?  No.  Wow.  SARS is a favorite of mine, too.  That's a great one.  Yeah, SARS is one of my faves.  Oh, thank you, sir.  Definitely.  And I also like Dry Vagina.  Oh, thank you.  We saw Tom Jones not long ago.  Where?  In Atlantic City?  Atlantic City, yeah.  How was he?  He was amazing.  They still got it?  The man still got it.  He got old broads like that stripper throwing their underwear at him?  My girlfriend did.  Really?  Yeah.  Threw underwear?  She had underwear.  Yeah, she brought him in, though. 
[03:44:00]  That's what they do.  It used to be in the old days, they would take their underwear off because they just  couldn't handle Tom Jones.  They'd be all wet and throw their underwear on him, but now they kind of bring them.  Oh, no.  There were some skanky old ones with hangy tits that definitely took their bras off.  Yeah, because they had them hanging there.  I don't mean to interrupt, but I'm watching Regis.  Regis is talking to Jay-Z.  I'm praying we're recording this.  Jay-Z.  What the hell does he know about Jay-Z?  He was rubbing his face for some reason. 
[03:44:30]  He kept rubbing Jay-Z.  This black won't come off.  What's the matter with you?  Jay-Z's a big guy.  What can they be talking about?  Regis is the guy that black rap guys want to be around.  He goes to Puffy's parties and stuff.  I'm with P. Diddy.  I went to P. Diddy's party, and then all of a sudden he's with guys from his own era.  I'm sure he's pitching his album to Jay-Z.  Jay-Z's dressed like some old-fashioned barrister right now. 
[03:45:00]  Yeah, the rap guys, I can't figure them out anymore.  You used to really be able to identify rap guys when they came on TV.  It was always, yeah, motherfucker, you know, with the baggy pants and stuff.  Now they're dressing in suits and stuff.  Yeah.  Yeah, he looks like an English professor.  Maybe he's going to go to court.  I never thought of that.  When you're smiling, the whole world smiles with you.  Come on, Jay-Z, sing with me.  Weren't you in the Police Academy movies? 
[03:45:30]  I always get you confused.  Make the sounds with your mouth.  Go ahead.  Sound like a train.  Could you do that for me?  I loved you in Ghostbusters.  Ah, little Regis.  Which one's this?  Is it when you're smiling?  Yeah.  Regis Phil there.  When you're smiling. 
[03:46:00]  I ought to blow my nose before I record.  When you're smiling.  The whole world smiles with you.  When you're laughing.  Oh, when you're laughing.  When you're laughing.  For the sun comes shining through.  Okay, terrific.  But when you're crying. 
[03:46:30]  You bring on the rain.  Shut up!  Shut up!  Shut up!  Be happy again.  Quiet.  Keep on smiling.  Okay, terrific.  Because when you're smiling.  Stop whining.  Stop whining.  The whole world smiles with you. 
[03:47:00]  Oh, my God.  A little horn in the load.  Ugh, shut up.  All right, that didn't work.  Oh, I thought he was good.  That was good?  Yeah, he's terrific.  That was a nice little interlude.  Fantastic.  You should have played the Forget Me Not song.  I know.  Forget me not, you sightless twat.  That's just the worst.  I got a surprise for you, Anthony.  What do you got?  Something we were talking about the last, I guess, yesterday. 
[03:47:30]  Yeah.  Oh, see, it doesn't start from the board.  No.  Ooh.  You got the touch.  Touch.  Yeah.  Yes.  You got the power.  Oh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Dirk Jiggler.  Dirk Jiggler.  You look like assholes right now, man. 
[03:48:00]  You got to move.  You know the streets.  Break the rules.  Take the heat.  You're nobody's fool.  You look like assholes right now, man.  You're at your best when the court gets rough.  You've been put to the death, but it's never enough.  You got the touch.  You got the touch.  The touch.  Yeah.  Lyrics are good, though. 
[03:48:30]  Oh, yeah.  Mark Wahlberg had to concentrate on that, man.  Because, I mean, if you like him, you don't like him, whatever.  But the guy can sing.  At least he knows how to sing on key.  It's kind of hard to sing off key.  Exactly.  That badly.  I forgot he could sing here.  Actually, I forgot he was a singer.  And to screw up like that, to that extent, to act like you can't sing that well.  You got the touch.  And he was just good enough where you're like, I can understand why this idiot would think  that he can sing. 
[03:49:00]  He was perfect.  He had the attitude.  He nailed it.  Dude, it was great.  That was a good film, man.  That was a really good movie.  He will rock you.  Baby, don't you know?  My heat will move your soul. 
[03:49:30]  Come on, come on, come on, come on.  Love me today.  Hello, exactly.  Love me tomorrow.  All day, all night, you feel my heat.  Hi.  Feel, feel, feel, feel my heat.  I think we should repeat that again.  Feel, feel, feel, feel, feel, feel my heat. 
[03:50:00]  Yeah.  Now, this would be pretty inside, but that sounds like a writing session that me and Lloyd  had back in 78.  Oh, we've had some good ones.  Oof.  All right.  I think I got one more song from the movie, Anthony.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Got to queue it up here.  From Boogie Nights, everyone.  Of course.  Of course.  Cool. 
[03:50:30]  McDonald's is a place to rock.  It is a restaurant where they buy food to eat.  It is a good place to listen to the music.  People flock here to get down to the rock music.  Rock and roll, McDonald's.  Rock and roll, McDonald's.  Rock and roll, McDonald's.  Rock and roll, McDonald's.  McDonald's will make you fat. 
[03:51:00]  They serve Big Macs.  They serve quarter pounders.  They will put pounds on you.  Rock and roll, McDonald's.  Rock and roll, McDonald's.  Rock and roll, McDonald's. 
[03:51:30]  Thank you. 
[03:52:00]  Thank you. 
[03:52:30]  London, rock on Chicago. Wheaties, reference to champions.  The great Wesley Willis, who has cast on.  What a great man. He should be in the same category as George Washington Carver, Frederick Douglass.  Black people should be proud of Wesley Willis.  McDonald's should have used that as a commercial. How great would that have been? That would have been hilarious. 
[03:53:00]  Rock and roll McDonald's.  Just show a bunch of white people looking like what?  All confused.  Yeah, and black people dancing and snapping their fingers.  It's definitely catchy.  It really is.  I'm not getting it.  It sounds a lot like Biz Markie.  Yeah.  He's got the Burger King and the McDonald's grams of fat.  Oh, no, Burger King should use it as a commercial.  Oh, wait.  He's tracking McDonald's. I'm sorry.  I think he said that Burger King's better.  Yeah, but then you just use the hook and then you can use it for McDonald's.  Of course.  Oh, I get confused. 
[03:53:30]  That's what I got out of that.  Let's go to Rob on Long Island.  What's up, Rob?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  How are you?  I'm good.  Okay, I'll tell you what I learned.  I have no idea what this means, but it made you guys laugh.  So I learned that Lady Dime makes Jim Lair sound like George Washington.  Very good.  Thank you.  Have a good one.  That was a great one.  That was really good.  Let's go to Ted.  Hey, Ted, what's going on?  Well, I want my six and a half cents back for the last segment.  And I want to call it Jim Norton's shit, Ted.  Yeah, but you've got to understand, this show, as long as you get seven cents of entertainment a day, 
[03:54:00]  that's, we're doing our job.  Work's on an average, sir, not on a minute-by-minute basis.  Right.  So I think we gave you, I think we gave you at least seven cents of entertainment today.  Of course.  Why do you want to call me names, sir?  I like it, Jim.  You're funny.  Oh, thank you, fella.  All right.  You're welcome.  Bye.  Love you, boys.  Bye.  I can't wait for our big phone meeting we're having today.  You're so psyched for it.  Yeah, we have a phone meeting. 
[03:54:30]  For what?  Exactly.  For what?  I have a couple of questions.  You do?  Oh, yeah.  You think they'll be addressed and answered?  Yeah, I'm just curious as to why when you call XM, it says the home of Major League Baseball  and Bob Edwards.  That's a period, not a...  It would be nice to have something else in there.  It would be nice.  You could bring that up.  Sure.  Or on the homepage, maybe on the website.  Uh-huh.  You know, just a little mention.  They're obsessed with Bob Edwards.  They think that Bob's going to just bring in just unbelievable subs for the company. 
[03:55:00]  All right, Jimmy.  We're going to look into that, and we'll see.  I'll talk to the guy that is in charge of that, and perhaps we could get that taken care of.  But look, I went on the homepage today, and I want to know why the Opie and Anthony are not on there.  I'm sure Bob Edwards is great, and we'll bring in a totally different demo.  Well, that's what you heard today, and perhaps tomorrow it'll be different.  Okay, well, then how come when you call on the phone, it says, um... 
[03:55:30]  Next question.  I called...  Next question, please.  We're done with you, Jimmy.  I know you are.  And don't stick your big retarded friend, Club Soda Kenny, after me.  Listen, Forrest Gump haircut, I just wanted to know why...  Holy ass.  Wow.  Are you insane?  Oh, Jesus.  You don't like program directors at satellite radio companies.  I don't know.  I just don't know if it's his call.  I just want to know why.  Like, Bob Edwards is...  But that's good that Bob Edwards and Opie and Anthony is totally different people you're attracting. 
[03:56:00]  Look, you know, I'm sure he does a great show over there at the NPR station.  Absolutely.  But you know what?  No one cares.  They just don't.  They're not running out to get their XM satellite radios because they have Bob Edwards.  But why this pride in that and this embarrassment about the Opie and Anthony show, or fear?  When is that going to end?  Well, maybe they decided that no one cares that they're not running out to get their  units because of our show as well.  Whatever.  But if that's what you're thinking, well, Bob Edwards falls certainly in that same category. 
[03:56:30]  No one is running out to get satellite radio because of him.  A few people here and there, but it's not the huge rush for units.  You know?  I mean, someone's got their head up their ass in marketing because no one cares.  What do you mean?  Oh, there is marketing.  You're right.  They don't care.  All right.  Thank you.  Let's go to Steve in Jersey.  Steve, what's up?  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hey.  I learned today that you can't wear a captain's hat if someone has to scoop out your bowels.  See?  That's seven cents right there.  And also, Buffalo hot pussy jokes never fucking fuck. 
[03:57:00]  Very good.  Rob in Jersey, what's up?  Hey, boys.  Hey.  I learned today that you shouldn't fart in elevators with hot chicks.  Yeah.  Jimmy knows that.  He obviously knows that rule.  Yeah, he showed that yesterday.  Sean in Jersey.  A lot of Jersey calls today.  What's up, Sean?  Hey, guys.  I learned that when soliciting a prostitute in front of police detectives, you pretend you're  asking for directions to the tunnel.  That's a good one.  See?  There was a lot of seven cents today. 
[03:57:30]  Let's see.  George MC from Yonkers.  I learned today that Bernie Getz's email address is too cute.  It should be something like 38NBlaster at AOL.com.  Chief from New York.  Some days you think, you know, you didn't give the folks a program, and then you do the  what did we learn, and you realize, yeah, there was a lot of good stuff.  Chief from New York.  I learned that I could hear the word Gamma O 500 times in 15 minutes.  John from D.C.  Jim would love effing a pregnant chick.  To him, it's like having a three-way.  And Chris from Boston.  I learned today you can't wear a captain's hat if someone has to scoop out your bowels. 
[03:58:00]  Yeah, we do that one.  How is that starting, the music starting early, and the clock says five of?  Oh, is the clock wrong?  What do we got, like a minute and a half left or so?  Let's get on that in the meeting today.  Clock's wrong.  Clock wrong.  Wade in New Hampshire.  What's up, Wade?  Hey, how's it going, O&A?  Pretty good.  What's up?  It's my deal, Wade.  What's up, beefy tit?  Well, whatever, shit dick.  Those are some sweet numbers.  What's up, man?  Shit dick.  I learned today that it's not okay for a hooker to shit in Jimmy's bathroom, but she can dump all 
[03:58:30]  over his chest all she wants.  All right, granted, a little inconsistency.  Good point.  A lot when it comes to your life.  Okay, fuck off.  Bye, fella.  All right, there he goes.  Oh, I want to wish a happy birthday to my girl.  Happy birthday, baby.  There you go.  What is that?  Very smart of you to remember.  Yes, I remember.  I remember those things.  You just don't remember old anniversaries.  I don't remember old wedding anniversaries.  Wedding anniversaries.  Even on the stand in court. 
[03:59:00]  Mr. Kumiya, what was your wedding anniversary?  How much did that cost you?  Buy me, Dominic.  Buy me.  I pass.  That was the best quote in the paper when all that went down, that Anthony did not know  the day he was married.  Did not know.  When asked what his wedding date was, Anthony said, I don't know.  Black Monday.  I don't know.  I'm going to leave your words up here for everyone to read, Anthony.  I don't know.  I couldn't tell you my wedding anniversary date.  Of course not. 
[03:59:30]  Couldn't tell you.  You block it out of your head like a ugh.  I remember the wedding on the green shag rug.  That's right.  In a bar.  That's now a strip club.  Yep.  See, we could have done that for 20 minutes.  Oops.  Oh, well.  Mike from Baltimore.  What did you learn on the program today?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Hey, honey, nutty pumpkin ass.  Hi, Mike.  Thanks for calling the program.  You're welcome.  I learned that a quarter pounder has 28 grams of fat.  Good call.  Rock and roll McDonald's.  Three, two, what is it?  One?  Oh, one more thing.  Jody and Anthony. 
[04:00:00]  Program complete.  Listen to this crowd roar.  The game that was born on the radio now joins the next generation of radio.  XM Satellite Radio is now the official satellite service of Major League Baseball.  Starting in 2005, XM will bring you live play-by-play from every MLB team, all season long, from spring training through the World Series.  Now you can hear your hometown team wherever you are, all part of your basic monthly XM plan.  Major League Baseball, coming to XM in 2005.  It's radio to the power of X. 
[04:00:30]  That's his first two-  Big Ten Basketball.  It's the Big Ten Today on XM Satellite Radio.  It's Tuesday, December the 28th, 2004.  I'm Ari Bykovsky with the Big Ten Today.  More Big Ten Basketball hits the floor tonight.  Iowa ranks 17th in the nation by the AP, 19th in the Coaches Bowl.  It's hoping to continue winning when they play Air Force.  The Falcons have a record of 6-4 and looking for a win following two consecutive losses. 
[04:01:00]  The pregame rolls in at 6-15 Central, 5-15 Mountain.  And that game's at 7 Central, 8 Eastern, on Big Ten Channel, 186.  Indiana suffered its sixth straight loss right before the holiday break.  Really hopes that Santa puts a win in the stocking for tonight's game against Ball State.  The Hoosiers are 2-6, and at the bottom of the league, the Cardinals stand at 5-3.  The pregame rolls in at 6 Central. 
[04:01:30]  The game is an hour later at 7 Central, 8 Eastern, on Big Ten Channel, 187.  Penn State has a record of 5-5, but the Nittany Lions have dropped their past three.  They'll be playing for the win tonight against Valparaiso.  The Crusaders are 2-6 and were stomped by top-ranked Illinois about 10 days ago.  The pregame starts at 6 p.m. Eastern.  The game is at 6.30 Eastern on Big Ten Channel, 188.  Switching gears, just in case you haven't heard, Ohio State quarterback Troy Smith  won't be playing in the Alamo Bowl against Oklahoma State tomorrow night. 
[04:02:00]  The sophomore was suspended for violating team and NCAA rules.  Smith has led the Buckeyes to a 4-1 record in their final five games,  including a stunning 37-21 win over Michigan.  Sophomore Justin Zwick, who had started the season, will replace Smith.  He lost the starting job after separating his non-throwing shoulder in the sixth game of the season.  That's the Big Ten today on XM Satellite Radio.
