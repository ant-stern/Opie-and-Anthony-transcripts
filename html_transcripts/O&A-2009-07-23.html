<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The July 23rd, 2009, Opie and Anthony Show began with significant technical difficulties affecting audio levels.  The hosts immediately transitioned to their recurring segment featuring Bobo, who, per their earlier instructions, had shaved his genitals and brought the hair to the studio in a large garbage bag.  Management’s new restrictions preventing certain interactions with interns, specifically a planned prank involving Bobo's pubic hair, were a source of frustration for the hosts.  The conversation then shifted to the Naked Cowboy's mayoral candidacy, playing audio clips from his press conference and discussing his campaign with a mix of amusement and derision.  The Naked Cowgirl (Sandy Cain), who was apparently emulating the Naked Cowboy, was also mentioned, including a voicemail message from her.  Technical problems, including malfunctioning phones and audio pops, continued to plague the broadcast.  The hosts speculated on the Naked Cowboy's success and methods, and the tourists' reactions.

The show then featured a discussion of a seemingly awkward interview of Twisted Sister on Regis Philbin's show, focusing on a mispronunciation of a band member's name.  Further technical difficulties, particularly with the phone lines, persisted. A segment followed discussing the Obama healthcare bill and a related news conference, incorporating comedic commentary and listener calls.  The hosts debated the percentage of Americans with health insurance, shared personal anecdotes about self-surgery due to lack of healthcare access, and returned to mocking the absurdity of the Naked Cowboy's mayoral run. The show briefly concluded with a search for images of "bad" young breasts online.

A subsequent segment focused on two main topics: healthcare reform and the arrest of Professor Henry Louis Gates Jr.  The hosts offered cynical commentary on insurance companies and costs, using profanity liberally.  Audio clips of Barack Obama discussing his healthcare plan were played.  The discussion of the Gates arrest explored whether race played a role, featuring callers with diverse perspectives, some supporting the police and others criticizing their actions.  The hosts speculated on the incident and Obama's response, again employing profanity and sarcasm.  Sonny Farrelly was a guest, offering commentary and details about the Gates incident.  Other callers shared personal anecdotes and perspectives.  Tangents included a caller's "boobie story," a discussion of Jimmy Norton's upcoming performance in Georgia, a detailed discussion of lax laws regarding underage stripping and prostitution in Rhode Island (with calls from people with firsthand knowledge), a news story about unclaimed bodies due to high funeral costs, and a darkly comedic discussion about unconventional body disposal methods, spurred by the unclaimed bodies segment.  The segment concluded with a call about a dog accidentally killed on a highway.

Another segment began with a discussion about funeral arrangements, focusing on costs and warranties of coffins and vaults.  Callers shared anecdotes about burying family members, including stories about digging a grave and scattering ashes at sea with disastrous results.  The discussion then turned to cremation, with a caller who worked at a crematorium detailing the process.  The conversation shifted to caller Paul's description of his pornography-viewing work habits.  Further discussion of funeral costs and low-income options like Potter's Field, and disparities in access based on religious affiliation, ensued.  More callers recounted experiences burying or cremating relatives and pets, some involving DIY burials and difficult animal euthanasia. Callers described emotional responses to deaths, and the legality of backyard burials was debated, with Vermont mentioned as a possible exception.

A segment featured numerous voicemails from Bobo, documenting his attempts to contact a woman named Christina.  This culminated in Bobo's appearance in the studio with a bag of his pubic hair, leading to banter between him and the hosts.

A later segment started with a listener's query about a dog's howling, quickly devolving into sexually explicit conversations.  Studio guest Jimmy was subjected to graphic questioning about sexual fantasies involving Christina, with detailed descriptions of sexual acts.  Bobby Lee joined later.  The conversation shifted to the New York Mets, interspersed with further explicit talk and discussions about penis size and appearance, enlargement pills, and imagined sexual encounters.  Much visual content was discussed and implied, referencing pornography. The hosts and guests frequently interrupted each other in a highly informal and comedic atmosphere.  Bobby Lee blowing on something off-camera concluded the segment.

The final segment featured a heavily intoxicated Bobo engaging in bizarre and sexually suggestive on-air acts.  Bobo participated in off-microphone activities involving blowing and spitting, which amused the hosts.  The hosts repeatedly urged Bobo to pull up his pants, fearing their boss's arrival.  The conversation briefly touched upon Obama's healthcare press conference and Republican opposition before returning to Bobo’s increasingly erratic behavior due to intoxication. Bobo expressed exhaustion and difficulty feeling his legs, prompting jokes about him falling asleep.  The conversation became crude and sexually explicit, focusing on penises, spitting, and sexual acts. Bobo eventually left, planning to return the next day.  The show ended with announcements about upcoming events featuring Jimmy's Punchline and other promotional material.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver. Let's get the show on the road.  Opie and Anthony, Jim Norton.  And it sounds a little weird in my headphones today.  Do it?  Oh yeah, it does.  I don't notice. Let me see. 
[00:00:30]  No.  Sounds a little sharp.  Really?  A little high-end-y?  We'll deal.  Hey.  Could be my ears.  Your ears?  Good morning.  Good morning.  How is everyone this fine morning?  This fine Thursday morning.  Thursday.  July 23rd, 2009.  Yeah.  Bobo shaved his genitals, and he's coming in studio to show us.  Well, finally a follow-up to a story.  Thank God we got all the big news happenings. 
[00:01:00]  Yuck.  Tissues.  Yeah, apparently, if you remember, he was very embarrassed by his genital hair.  Oh, well.  And well, he should have been.  Very hairy gentleman.  Yeah.  And his beloved doesn't like a lot of hair.  Are they going out?  Aye.  Is that clever ruse still going on?  I don't even ever think that that would happen. 
[00:01:30]  She's got to let him off the hook.  I love you.  Says I love you to her on the phone.  God.  Does he really?  Poor bastard.  Yeah.  Oh, no.  I hear the voicemails.  They're fantastic.  They're wonderful.  And yeah, so I guess he took everyone's advice and shaved.  Last I heard, he didn't want to shave because he didn't want his razor smelling like his dick.  Why don't you just throw the razor away?  Well, wash your dick before you shave. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you.  But how long are you using your razor?  Well, I don't think, I think he meant like an electric clipper.  Oh, I see.  You know, one of those.  It's got to look like a disaster.  Because you can't, I can't wait.  It's going to look like a mangy dog.  I can't wait to see a man's area.  Just big mats of hair missing.  Like an old man trying to shave.  It's going to look horrendous down there.  He told me that he was working on it in sections.  In sections?  I asked him if he had shaved it.  And he's like, I'm working on it. 
[00:02:30]  And he was doing it in quadrants.  Really?  In sector 24B.  Well, as soon as he comes in, bring him in here and have him pull his pants down.  He's right at the ball bag.  He's also going to be bringing in the remaining byproduct.  I heard.  What?  It's going to be in a little baggie.  Oh, God.  Why?  Actually, it's going to be in a giant baggie.  Oh, you know that's going to be used for something horrible on this program.  It's going to be in a huge garbage bag.  You just know.  Oh, no.  Well, it's funny you should say that. 
[00:03:00]  What?  Got an idea, do you?  No, it's not even my idea.  But we're not allowed to do it because it involves an intern.  We're not allowed to do stuff with interns anymore.  It's just another thing.  Can't fuck them in the ass anymore?  Damn it.  How do you think they become interns?  I know.  Just another thing radio has taken away from us.  What do you mean we can't do anything with them?  There's a certain thing we want to do with Bobo's little baggie of hair.  We can't do it to the intern. 
[00:03:30]  Wow.  And trust me, it's fine.  It's safe and all that.  I don't understand.  I don't really think management ever worked in radio.  Interns have been used for crazy stuff since the beginning of radio, basically.  Yeah.  And in very recent times, they've taken that out of the mix.  You really can't do anything with the interns, which basically means there's no reason to have them.  Yeah.  What do they do?  We could have waitresses. 
[00:04:00]  We should just have waitresses.  We'll hire waitresses to get food and coffee, and then that's it.  Hot waitresses or flow-like waitresses?  Go to flow.  Flow.  Beehive hairdo.  Yeah.  What do you have, honey?  Chewing the gum with a pencil in her big hair.  I mean, one of the great things of having interns was you can mess with them and do crazy shit.  I would love to know who decided that that's no longer okay and why.  It's not a liability.  Stop with that bullshit. 
[00:04:30]  Yeah.  Enough.  Enough with the liability.  Enough with being extra safe and extra careful.  Come on.  This is supposed to be satellite radio.  It is satellite radio, right?  Everything's safe now.  Everything easy.  So we really have to figure out, you know, another way to do it, I guess.  Yeah.  But it was more fun to have one of the interns do it.  I can imagine.  Because they're all eager to please and all that.  It just worked.  And they get all degraded.  Yeah.  It's fun to watch. 
[00:05:00]  Did it have something to do with looking like, I don't know, it's the 70s?  Yeah, we were going to make some facial hair.  Facial hair.  Yeah.  We could say what we're going to do.  What's wrong with that?  But you can't do that to the interns.  Eric's not an intern.  Yeah, that's true.  You rock.  Not even an employee.  Just an albatross.  But if you asked the interns, they would step up and do this in a second. 
[00:05:30]  They would hold no one libel.  They would just go, look.  Yeah, I'll do this.  Who cares?  As an opportunity.  Absolutely.  And I think it should be up to the intern if they want to do it or not.  Yeah.  Not some corporate douche saying you can't do that to an intern.  Let the intern decide.  Because there's no safety risk.  No.  Everything's up to someone else.  Huh?  Everything's up to someone else these days.  Everything you do is up to someone else.  You can't just come up with an idea and do it anymore. 
[00:06:00]  Dude, nameless, faceless people, too.  Yeah, I know.  There's people controlling the show I've never met.  In my life.  No accountability.  None.  I don't know who these people are.  It's strange.  Who are these people?  I mean, it's better we don't know them because we'll just be disgusted.  Yeah, and we'd say who they are and then get in trouble.  Well, that leads to the other thing that we, oh, I wish we could discuss.  But we have to wait for somebody and then we can discuss it because we will discuss it.  One day soon.  No, no, today.  One hour soon. 
[00:06:30]  Today.  I hope Steve Blatter's coming in early because he wants to talk to us about something.  So I hope he's on his way in because, as you can tell, we're in a slight bad mood.  And we'll be fine and there will be plenty of laughs and entertainment today.  Trust me because we're professionals.  But I hope Steve's coming in pronto so we can discuss the situation.  And after you hear our side of it, then we discuss it on the air.  You want a mid-show meeting?  I'd love one.  I have to fly today. 
[00:07:00]  Not a mid-show meeting.  This is a – during the break he comes in.  That's what I mean.  We explain exactly what's going on and exactly why it's okay.  And then we go on the air and explain what's going on to the listeners.  Mm-hmm.  You know?  I'm game.  Absolutely.  I guess that's all we can say about that for now.  Yeah.  Well, in other news, Anthony, the naked cowboy.  Oh, boy.  This guy is terrific.  Oh, God.  I don't think I've ever hated anyone more in my life than this guy. 
[00:07:30]  He's funny, though.  The guy is funny.  I'll say that.  Is he, Jim?  Yeah.  Yeah, huh?  I don't understand –  Let's see.  I don't understand why his dumb, stupid act has lasted all these years.  Basically –  Rubes.  That's why.  He's a, quote, cowboy that wears underpants and boots, and he has a guitar, and he sings  songs sort of.  Oh, God.  One of our own is doing the naked cowgirl, by the way, Sandy Cain. 
[00:08:00]  Sandy Cain.  How's that working out for her?  She saw it and decided, you know, why is he getting all this cash when I could just go  out there?  I'd rather fuck him.  Where is she?  Get her on the phone.  Travis told me that she's in Times Square every day doing this.  She is.  Every single day.  Travis, you see her?  No, he's in the other – he's in the back office, right?  Okay.  I got to know how she's doing down there in Times Square.  We can give her a call if you want.  She is horrific looking, and she's dressing up as the naked cowgirl. 
[00:08:30]  Which, by the way, I think the naked cowboy's wife does.  Yeah, I think she does a version of the naked cowgirl.  And does that.  Oh, by the way, also the phones aren't working.  I mean –  Oh, nice.  Okay, great.  That's good.  We didn't want that to work today, so everything's going exactly as planned.  And a mic is popping.  If you didn't hear that.  Popping, that was pretty cool.  And the audio doesn't sound good in the headphones today.  Pop.  I don't know what changes within a mere 16, 18 hours.  Someone's making popcorn. 
[00:09:00]  Someone's just making popcorn.  Can you hear it popping?  I heard like a –  I lost the phones.  Whatever.  Oh.  Where'd you put them?  Where'd you have them last?  Now we got jungle music going off.  Vibrate.  How about vibrate?  Everyone else is on vibrate.  Oh, uh-oh.  I wasn't, but now I am.  Lost is selling all their stuff off.  Yeah.  What?  We'll get into that a little later.  Oh, man.  When?  After the season in 2010.  Oh, locks underwear.  So the naked cowboy. 
[00:09:30]  Yes.  We got the naked cowgirl, Santa Cain.  Hopefully we'll find out what that's all about.  So he's down there in Times Square every day.  And for some reason, the rubes, the Taurus, eat it up every day.  Are they eating it, really?  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  Yeah.  They love taking pictures with him.  And he charges money.  If you were a chick, would you find him interesting in any way?  Dreamy.  For real, though.  I try to think of it, if I'm some fat fucking housewife from Iowa and I come into town, would 
[00:10:00]  I be all excited about the naked cowboy?  You got to think of it like you are a rube, you're from East Bumfuck, and you look and  go, this New York City, oh my God, is it wacky.  Look, there's a guy in his underwear playing a guitar right in the middle of the crosswords  of the, oh, crosswords, the crossword puzzle of the world, crossroads of the world.  Which is right next to the Sudoku area. 
[00:10:30]  The Sudoku.  Sudoku village.  Of the country.  Yeah.  So they look at him like, oh my God, that's wacky, we need to take pictures, and then apparently  he goes, hey, five bucks, how much does he charge for a picture?  I don't even know.  But he walks away with a lot of money.  You've seen him go-  Money's in his boots.  The money's in his boots.  The money's in his boots.  For all you meth heads, and you need a few dollars, it's in his boots.  And there he is in the middle of the winter.  He's out there in the winter, right?  Oh, yeah.  All year round, when it's snowing. 
[00:11:00]  And I've seen him get into his car.  Oh, yeah.  And he does very well.  Could you fix the phone?  Parks by the Javits Center.  What?  He used to walk all that way?  Yeah.  And, yeah, he got a nice SUV.  Him and his wife get in there.  They open up the hatchback, get clothes on, pop in, and just drive away.  So he walks to the car in that dumb outfit?  Yeah.  Yeah.  With his guitar getting wet.  What does he do in the rain?  I guess he doesn't care about his guitar or a warped neck.  I don't think it's about the sound.  I don't think it's about the intonation of his guitar. 
[00:11:30]  Can he sing?  I don't even think he knows how to play.  No, he just, like, he strums it and sings songs like, what does he sing?  Does he sing that he is the naked cowboy?  Yeah, he has some hacky, quick little song that he plays.  He doesn't really know how to play.  No.  Most of these street musicians don't really know how to play.  What they know how to do is play for about 15 seconds as you're walking by.  You go, wow, that's all they need.  Wow, that's that.  I told the story in Boston.  Yeah.  We were hanging out in the one of the, I forgot the name of the park up there.  And we walked by this guy. 
[00:12:00]  He's a homeless dude.  He's a mess.  I'm like, wow, that sounds just like Eric Clapton.  Holy shit.  Amazing.  So I actually turned around.  He got me.  And I gave him a couple bucks, whatever it was at the time.  And then I decided I want to hear some more Eric Clapton.  I have nothing better to do.  And I love people watching.  So we sat, right?  He stopped playing the Eric Clapton song immediately, waited for more people to come walking by his  area and started up the Eric Clapton song exactly where he knows it for 15 seconds.  So he only knew. 
[00:12:30]  How brilliant is that, though?  That much.  And most of the time it works out where he's playing and someone drops money.  And so he stops playing to go, oh, thank you.  Thank you.  And then they walk off.  Restart.  He waits for them to be out of earshot.  Yeah.  And then he starts in with the Lalo, whatever the hell the song was, again.  So all you need to know is like 20, 30 seconds of a song.  You can make a fortune as a musician.  As a city musician.  As a city musician.  Oh, there he is.  So his naked cowboy is.  Can we turn him up a little so we hear what he sounds like? 
[00:13:00]  Yeah, hit it.  Yeah.  Hit it.  Yeah.  Sonny.  My car.  When you're not fighting, I need a man.  I'm playing the same day.  He's on the job.  Yeah.  He stinks.  What are we allowed to do to him legally?  Are we allowed to throw mustard on him?  No.  What are we allowed to do?  I'm just asking.  Anything is assault.  Even if you just throw mustard on him?  Yes.  Okay.  So we won't do that. 
[00:13:30]  Absolutely.  What are we allowed to do?  Are we allowed to get like one of those big high power like water guns?  No, we are not allowed to do that.  That is also assault.  Are we allowed to caress his smooth chest and ask him how he became such a well-built gentleman?  Only if he likes it and is fine with you snapping pictures of rubbing his chest.  Could we use that well-defined juicy ass of his as a dartboard?  No, I believe that isn't good either.  I just don't like this naked cowboy.  Anyway, we had him on the show once and me and Aunt, Jimmy, were you around for the 
[00:14:00]  naked cowboy?  I vaguely remember.  Oh, when he came in right at N.E.W., I think.  Yeah.  Well, I'm, you know, and I remember we all were just so, get the fuck out.  We don't know what to do with you.  He's a boring guy.  Well, it leads to what's going on today.  He officially announced he's running for mayor.  Officially?  Yeah.  It's official now.  Oh, Jimmy, what, are you laughing?  Yeah.  It's funny, right?  Of course it is.  You guys are nuts. 
[00:14:30]  Join our campaign.  He's officially running for mayor.  And when did the goof ticket start, Aunt?  Do you know anything about that?  Where all of a sudden there was a dog that ran for political office or, you know what  I mean?  It had to start, Aro.  It had to start somewhere.  Maybe we could get some history lesson from the listener.  Someone out there has to know.  Maybe FDR old rubber band legs.  He won, though.  But now you've got to deal with these goof tickets or these goof candidates. 
[00:15:00]  And the media picks it up.  You see the picture on the paper?  Oh, they run with it.  He held court in Times Square.  And there was a lot of press down there.  When this means nothing in the end.  It means nothing.  Nothing.  He's not going to get votes.  He's getting publicity for himself, which he's been able to do over the years somehow.  Well, he's smart.  The news just loves talking about him.  Well, if you're hanging out at the crossroads of the world, you're going to get some publicity. 
[00:15:30]  With your undies on.  Anyone else?  Two pairs of underwear, by the way.  Because one, his cock showed.  And he was told by the police to put on another pair of underwear so your cock doesn't show as much.  So the police ruined it for everyone?  Yes.  His juicy cock.  You can't see it anymore.  And now we got this.  That's a nice sound.  I like that.  What was that?  It sounded like somebody sucking on a lemon.  Yeah.  Did you guys hear that?  Or am I having a stroke?  No, we heard it.  I'm minutes away from calling it. 
[00:16:00]  I'm minutes away from calling it.  Look at the clock and just call it.  I'm telling you.  We're calling the show.  Bladder.  I hope you understand.  But if this shit isn't fixed within 15.  The phones went down again.  I am minutes away from calling it.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Link to server is down.  We got noises.  Yeah, that link to server.  You go down.  We got crybabies in this place.  We got things to discuss.  So Bladder, please get to work soon.  We got the Atlanta punchline tonight, tomorrow, and Saturday, just in case.  You gotta fly. 
[00:16:30]  Anyway, so he held court, did a press conference, announcing his candidacy for the mayor of New York City.  Now, what do you have to do in order to announce your candidacy?  Do you have to, you know, get a petition filled out?  What do you have to do?  Why?  You want to run for mayor?  You might as well just go, oh, my God, Danny.  You might as well just say, I'm running for mayor.  Yeah, I know.  Mayor!  We could get Bobo. 
[00:17:00]  I'd better be for mayor.  Well, here's a little taste from the press conference yesterday with the Nicky Cowboy.  You want to create jobs?  Prevent crime.  The city's gonna run on a dime.  Shut it.  Oh, my God.  And I mean both of you.  Jimmy, stop laughing and just shut it.  That makes me laugh.  I hate this guy.  Oh.  Funny.  He doesn't even know how to play the guitar.  No, it's just this chunk, chunk, chunk.  Ah, he's nuts.  I suck at the guitar.  I guarantee I can play better than him.  Yeah.  I can play a riff better than this fucking loser. 
[00:17:30]  He does that chunk, chunk, chunk thing and just now he's going to prevent crime.  What's he doing?  He's going to create jobs, prevent crime.  The city's gonna run on a dime.  Naked Cowboy for mayor.  Yeah.  The Naked Cowboy, a well-known Times Square street performer, unveiled his campaign for mayor of New York City on Wednesday.  I'm not here to be a dictator.  I'm here to be a representative of the people.  The cowboy's real name is Robert Burke.  He's 38 years old and he says he's running as a write-in, independent candidate. 
[00:18:00]  Folks, we need to tighten our belt.  And of course, that's just an expression because I don't even wear it.  Oh, my God.  He doesn't.  He doesn't.  That's funny.  All right.  I'll give him that.  That's hysterical.  This is going great.  Okay, terrific.  That's funny.  I'm funny.  Oh, my God.  I was only joking.  Holy Jesus.  This guy's great. 
[00:18:30]  And he's not a dictator.  I know.  He got me.  I was like, well, careful there, Naked Cowboy.  Yeah.  That'll hurt the campaign.  Jesus.  Holy God.  Why does the media humor us with this fucking guy?  And then, and why does the staff find the worst, the most boring reporter ever?  Every news station was doing a story on this yesterday.  Because the other news stations are all about themselves and didn't let the Naked Cowboy's  whole song.  Oh, really?  On their clips.  Oh, well.  So I got the Naked Cowboy heavy clips. 
[00:19:00]  But what you didn't hear in these clips was what his campaign.  What his penis was doing?  No, not his penis.  His campaign slogan.  Oh, the slogan.  What is that?  Never before has a man done so much with so little.  So, it's cool.  I like that.  It's funny.  Because he's just underpants and a hat, you know?  Oh, I thought it was dick size.  Here's some of his energy policy.  I declare all Fridays will be Naked Fridays.  What is he, a shock jock?  You're not really reading that, are you? 
[00:19:30]  It's in the post, yeah.  No, it's not.  I would never lie to you about this guy.  You sure it's not Scorch?  Wait, here's another one.  Raising revenue.  Yeah, raising revenue.  You have no idea how much tourists will pay to bungee jump off the Empire State Building.  I'd like to see that.  I don't think it'll go through, though.  For Homeland Security.  I agree with this a lot.  This is good.  This is good.  Everyone knows I've got a master's degree in being a total badass. 
[00:20:00]  He does.  Ah!  Ah!  Oh, it feels good to laugh.  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Exactly.  Oh, my God.  You got another one there, Jimmy?  No, unfortunately, they only gave us three.  Well, I got more of his plan over here.  Oh, that's funny.  I hope it's not the stuff you just said.  Naked Cowboy unveiled a fiscally conservative platform with liberal social policies, like performing 
[00:20:30]  gay marriages in Times Square, and also unveiled his own version of the Bat Signal.  Cowboy says he isn't afraid of the multi-million dollar war chest of incumbent candidate Michael  Bloomberg or the Democratic Party backing of candidate William Thompson.  I'm already the mayor of New York as far as the world sees it, so I'm just trying to formalize  that, and he has had two terms, so Galloway.  Real voters were unimpressed.  He's definitely not getting my vote. 
[00:21:00]  Really?  Really?  On the street broad?  Definitely not?  Yes.  Well.  I would let him hold me down and fuck my face, but I'm not voting for that boob.  I'm starting to think, even though he was like 93, I think Walter Cronkite committed suicide.  Yeah.  Can we get that story out there?  Yeah.  Because I think he's finally had it with what his profession has become.  Because the reporter is playing it like it's a real story.  Yeah.  And getting real on-the-street reaction to a fucking dope running for the mayorship of New 
[00:21:30]  York City.  It's a joke.  A dope in underwear.  Why can't you go on the...  I need to go into the media for real.  Fuck this shock jock crap.  I want to be the reporter that is the only one that goes out there and goes, this dope  in his underpants.  Yeah.  Set up the live shot right there with him.  Right.  And he'd be next to you like, all right, here it comes.  It's going to be great.  Another fluff piece on me.  Yeah.  And then the camera goes live and you just go, here is an idiot. 
[00:22:00]  Right.  I'm going to show you an idiot.  Right.  Is he out there today?  He will be.  Oh, he's out there every day.  I'm fucking doing some flipping today.  Nice.  Some HD flip.  Hi, Greg Hughes in Times Square.  I'm here.  This dope behind me in his underpants thinks he could be the mayor of New York.  Let's throw stuff at him.  Jesus.  Does his wife stand right there with him?  I think she wanders around Times Square.  I've never seen her. 
[00:22:30]  Yeah.  She set up shop somewhere else?  She's whatever.  Do you got a picture of her?  Maybe she's like, maybe she's in the alleys fucking.  Is that her?  I don't think so.  She is cute though.  Who is that?  She's good looking.  Yeah, she's cute.  Wow.  Yeah, good for her.  Let me see that pasty chick.  Not, you know, pasty, like skin, she's wearing pasties.  Yeah.  And she's got like, yeah, her boot, it looks like she's nude without nipples.  How do they do that in 10 degree weather?  Oh yeah, that's her.  I've seen pictures.  That's her?  Yeah, that's his wife.  She ain't bad. 
[00:23:00]  Because she's a girl.  Yeah, exactly.  Let me see, is that...  If that was on a guy, you'd be like, wow, that's really fucking disturbing.  Has she ever been grabbed?  Someone had to have grabbed her tits at one point.  Some drunk.  Had to have.  Like, does her husband have to fight guys all the time for grabbing his wife's tits?  He's too busy whoring himself out.  Are you kidding me?  It's going to take time away from the attention he gets.  From roves.  He's an attention-seeking jerk.  I know it's visual, but in this picture, who she's with is what I picture in my head every  time Andrew from Brooklyn calls in. 
[00:23:30]  Oh yeah.  That's the guy.  Oh yeah, that's who's on the other end of the show.  Some young Asian gentleman.  Let's get to the end of the naked cowboy thing here.  Galloway.  Real voters were unimpressed.  He's definitely not getting my vote.  New York ain't got time for that.  I mean, you know, he had his little fun up on the avenue, but New York is in serious  business and Bloomberg did a hell of a job.  Right.  Well, yeah.  Guess what?  I don't think Bloomberg has to worry about the naked cowboy.  No.  Could one media outlet say that? 
[00:24:00]  I think everything will be okay.  Yeah.  I don't think he's going to get elected.  We're not going to wake up and go, oh my God, what?  Naked cowboys, the mayor?  Oh no.  Now what?  Oh, that's her page.  The naked cowgirl.  So there you have it.  Websites and everything.  Look at these two.  I'm obsessed with this story.  Can we get more audio of the...  Yeah.  I wanted more audio.  I want to hear more of his platform.  Yeah.  I want to hear as much as we can.  Wow.  Does she go around like that with her ass hanging out?  I hope so. 
[00:24:30]  You know, the naked cowgirl is a lot more entertaining.  Yeah, but she's an average looking girl.  Yeah, but she's like almost...  She really is.  ...nude.  I don't know.  She's not right.  I mean...  I know what's funny.  Because her clothes are off.  You put pasties on a girl that's well endowed.  Yeah.  And she'll be arrested.  But because that girl has smaller boobs, they allow it to happen.  Do you think that's what it is?  That's a fact.  Does she have monster tits?  I don't care what the law is and all that.  They'll figure a way to get the well endowed girl with the pasties off the street.  Okay?  But if you've got smaller ones and you've got the pasties on, they're going to let you do your thing. 
[00:25:00]  Now, what does Sandy Cain do?  I don't know.  Her tits are disgusting.  Well, we should call her because, you know...  Does she have a phone?  Well, she left us a voicemail.  Eh, eh, I need to pay phone.  See, I finally need to play that.  I knew this would happen.  I knew this would happen.  Daddy put the Sandy Cain voicemail in front of me for literally two months.  We finally have a reason to play it and I can't find it.  A voicemail from her?  Yeah.  I think it's her. 
[00:25:30]  Huh?  I think what it is is her outgoing voicemail.  Like, if you...  Oh, okay.  When you call her, it's like an answering machine and this is what her outgoing machine is.  Yeah, we'll find it.  Didn't we do a cribs with her and go to her shithole?  Yeah, we did.  What was wrong with it?  It wasn't that bad, actually.  I'm trying to remember.  Didn't she have roaches?  Yeah, I think there were roaches everywhere.  That was it.  But they were her friends.  Yeah.  She named them.  She needed something to talk to.  If you name the roaches, you know...  And they would do it at cribs and they said, we have a monster.  It was her. 
[00:26:00]  We'll find it.  So, a quickie from Regis.  Ah.  Remember D. Schneider, I guess his name is?  D. Schneider.  Schneider.  D. Schneider.  It's Schneider.  Schneider, right?  From Twisted Sister?  Yep.  Yeah.  So, he's doing Regis.  Oh, no.  Why?  Wasn't he a badass rocker dude?  Yeah, what?  A badass rocker dude shouldn't be on Regis.  Oh.  Oh, this is going to be a dude's chill.  Is that...  What do you think about that? 
[00:26:30]  Uh, yeah.  He shouldn't.  Are you New York guys or where are you from?  Are you New York guys, Regis?  This is...  How long have you been broadcasting?  Now, this is not just D.  This is Twisted or what?  Um, just focus on D. Schneider.  Oh, okay.  Are you New York guys or where are you from?  Yeah, New York.  Yeah.  New York, Long Island, Bronx, Long Island, Staten Island.  Yeah, cool.  Staten Island.  This is D. Smith, the leader of the...  Oh, my gosh.  I'm just collecting him.  J.J. French.  Where's J.J.?  Right there.  J.J., good to see you again. 
[00:27:00]  And Eddie Fingers...  Uh...  Fingers.  Ojeda.  Ojeda, yes.  And Mark the Animal Mendoza, of course.  What else would he be?  Anyone pick up on it?  No.  Yeah, I didn't see any reaction.  You didn't pick up on it?  Can we hear it again?  Yeah, let me hear it again.  Listen closely.  Listen closely.  All right.  Here we go.  Are you New York guys or where are you from?  Yeah, New York.  Yeah.  New York, Long Island, Bronx, Long Island, Staten Island.  Yeah, cool.  Staten Island.  This is Dee Smith, the leader of the... 
[00:27:30]  Oh, my gosh.  I'm just collecting him.  J.J. French.  Where's J.J.?  Right there.  Yeah.  J.J., good to see you.  You called Dee Smith?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Dee Smith.  Smith.  Dee Smith.  Dee Smith.  Did he say Dee Smith?  Yes, he did.  Or he didn't know how to pronounce...  No, it's just Dee Smith.  Oh, my God.  That's not like a bad...  J.J. French?  It was kind of like the Motley Crue.  To hear... 
[00:28:00]  These old codgers trying to, like, talk to rockers.  And to hear, like, Regis talking about Twisted.  Yeah.  Oh.  When years ago, you know, on MTV, you're watching the videos, and now it's like, J.J.  D.Fredge, Dee Smith, Dee Smith, Dee Smith, Dee Smith, oh, they're...  What audience are they going for?  It's Twisted Sister.  On Regis.  They get old women watching Regis. 
[00:28:30]  Yeah.  I don't know.  Like, what are they going...  Not even old women like that are going to wear spandex and go to a Twisted show.  Right.  That's a weird booking right there.  Wow.  So, that's just a quickie from Regis.  Good old Regis.  Dee Smith.  Sandy Cain's voicemail message?  Want to hear it.  Hi, my name is Sandy Cain. 
[00:29:00]  I always wanted fortune and fine.  So, I came to Times Square and became the Naked Cowgirl and who.  I want to thank the New York Times, cause, ooh.  They printed me there in color on the cover and ooh.  I want to thank the Naked Cowboy, too. 
[00:29:30]  For being my mentor and ooh.  I want to thank you for calling me and ooh.  I'm the Naked Cowgirl.  Hey, Sandy, I'm 46th Street and Broadway.  Everyone come see me and take a photo with me.  Oh, my God.  Keep it up.  Leave a message with your name and your number. 
[00:30:00]  Bye.  I like it.  Do you?  I do.  I like it more than his stuff.  She has this weird way of just giving out information.  Oh, she's still going?  Yeah.  Oh, sorry.  Why is she still going?  She went over the tile door.  She's terrible.  Oh, she a mess.  I can't go to the phones, unfortunately.  Who could it be?  See, this is where we usually work the phones.  Who could it be? 
[00:30:30]  Yeah.  Where could I be?  Yeah.  Believe it or not, I'm not home.  This is Costanza.  Why don't we take our first break so maybe Mars can fix the phones here?  We really need the phones for this type of radio we do.  We love our listeners.  They do have to work for us, which is great.  To see the big error message up there on the phone thing is quite disheartening.  Yes.  Why?  Why?  Why?  It's going to be the same rant you guys have heard a million times, so just remember the last time we bitched. 
[00:31:00]  How could she call herself a naked cowgirl, by the way?  Why not?  Because there's a naked cowgirl.  Yeah.  You can't own that.  You can't own naked cowgirl.  You might be able to copyright it.  Yeah, really?  Like, you can't go.  I don't think you'd be able to go and.  Like, didn't the naked cowboy sue?  He did sue someone, I think.  For using his.  He sued M&M's.  Yeah, M&M's.  For using his likeness.  Yeah, because they had like an M&M dressed like the naked cowboy. 
[00:31:30]  Mm-hmm.  An M&M dressed like the naked cowboy.  Did they stop doing it?  Yeah.  Yeah, he, they, I think the season desist went out and they pulled their ad campaign that he was featured in.  A fucking street performer has a lawyer.  Well, in a way it's annoying, but in a way it's like, okay, so then they yanked it.  So that's like one bit less famous you are.  Like, I don't know what to do in that situation.  Because if he doesn't sue, it's like you're just becoming more, you're becoming iconic by that happening.  So people are just going to pay you more. 
[00:32:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Although I understand, it's weird.  I guess he doesn't want a whole Times Square full of naked cowboys, you know?  Okay.  Imagine that.  Yes, I do.  You walk up next to him and just start playing a guitar and just right in front of him, putting  your arm around girls, taking pictures and getting money.  How pissed would he be?  These aren't real street musicians.  They're pros.  No, this guy's just a...  I mean, it used to be you're a street musician.  Yeah.  You set up somewhere and hopefully make a few bucks.  And now it's another thing that the city has completely controlled. 
[00:32:30]  Now you've got to get all sorts of permits.  A permit.  Which are really expensive.  So that takes most of the street musicians out of the game.  Yeah.  Because that was the whole reason they hit the street.  Because they were poor and down on their luck.  They had no money.  They were called bums.  So the brilliance of the city, they're like, well, if you're going to be a street musician,  you need to have a permit and the permit will cost you blah, blah, blah.  So they've taken that element out of it.  And now you've got well-polished professionals acting like street musicians setting up here 
[00:33:00]  and there.  You're a bum.  What do you got there, Jimmy?  It's called being a bum, Jules.  Oh, no.  Just a guy who cut himself with a saw by mistake.  I'm just like, ready to go.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Ow.  Can we play the Sandy Cain appearance from our show?  Oh, that one.  Well, when she decided to become the Naked Cowgirl, she came in to promote herself on  our show.  Why wouldn't she?  To get the whole thing going.  And we had a lot of fun with her.  Remember this, Ant?  Oh, I do.  Yes.  All right.  We're going to go to break a little early today. 
[00:33:30]  So hopefully we can fix the phones and talk to you guys.  Opie and Anthony.  Believe it or not, George isn't at home.  Please leave a message at the beep.  I must be out or I'd pick up the phone.  Where could I be?  Believe it or not, I've got home.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  We might have phones.  Pardon?  An hour into our radio show. 
[00:34:00]  That's all right.  Right?  Ooh.  No big deal.  Well, we had phones during that live read.  Yeah, we did.  Nothing but pure professionalism with the Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah.  I've just been gazing now at the Naked Cowgirl's boobies.  I don't know.  There's something supple about them.  They're nice because they're boobies.  Yeah.  No, no, no.  Not all boobies.  Even a bad set is nice for the most part. 
[00:34:30]  They seem cushy and comfy.  If you have youth on your side, you don't have bad boobies.  Yeah.  Show me a pair of bad boobies with youth on your side.  Prove me wrong today.  All right.  Danny, can you do that?  I missed, like, the game.  And it can't have some kind of surgery thing happening.  We're looking for bad boobies.  Show me a bad set of boobies.  Oh, geez.  The preferences must.  Oh, yeah.  Safe search is moderate.  Get off. 
[00:35:00]  But youth has to be on the woman's side.  That's the criteria.  Okay?  Because you can show me an older woman with the bad boobs, and I'll go, yeah, of course.  Youth on their side, a set of bad boobies.  I think that's a very hard thing to find.  I really do.  And, Sonny Ferrelli, I don't know what the fuck you're talking about, so why don't you  fucking call the show?  If you're getting instant feedback 20 times in a row, why don't you just call the radio  show?  All right.  We don't have time for your nonsense today. 
[00:35:30]  How about those?  That's real?  Yeah.  Get the fuck out of here.  What did you put in the search?  Horrendous ugly boobs.  Really?  I put ugly young tits, and I got this attempted bodybuilding woman.  Let me see.  With horrid little...  All right.  You know what?  I am so wrong.  Wow.  I am so wrong.  Did you say ugly young tits? 
[00:36:00]  Yes.  Ugly young tits.  No.  Danny, yours is worse.  Yeah.  I just want...  Yeah.  Yeah, just put that in the service if you want to play along at home.  That's horrible.  Eventually, we'll have some kind of visual element to our show.  We've been asking for that for a while.  I think it's a brilliant concept that we could really, really have fun with.  Wow.  Another bad set.  Oh, God.  I don't even know how to describe them.  They look like calf feet.  It looks like a horseshoe. 
[00:36:30]  Yeah, that's awful stretched out.  A fleshed horse shoe.  It's like a skin toilet seat.  Could you go back to the first one?  I'm trying to figure out what the problem is with the first set.  Old toilet titties.  How do you explain the first set?  It's maybe small B-cups, and just place two golf balls.  For real.  Yeah, the nipples are like nose cones to a...  Is that real, Danny?  A rocket.  I've seen this before. 
[00:37:00]  I mean, not in person or anything, but this is just one of those extreme cases of puffy nips.  But this is very extreme.  Is that what he changed his name to now?  Puffy nips.  He has to shoot up another nightclub first.  All right.  I'm wrong.  Oh, well.  I'd still suck those big puffy nips.  These are the weird-looking.  Get the fuck out of here.  Oh, God.  It looks like our tits have on dunce hats.  I would be creeped out.  Horrible.  Yeah.  You'd feel like you're sucking on tumors or something. 
[00:37:30]  Yeah, okay.  Obama's press conference.  You know what?  I was this close to watching.  Were you?  And it was on every channel.  I was busy.  I don't get what that's all about.  Why can't they just take turns so we can watch other stuff?  Yeah.  Because guess what?  Some of us are not interested in the bullshit that he's going to spew about what this country needs.  About reaching into our pockets.  Right.  How about you just fix the waste that's going on in government? 
[00:38:00]  Yeah.  And then get back to me, and then I'll start listening to you.  Yeah.  Find out how much money's left after all the waste is cut.  Right.  Yeah.  Enough with taking more money out of our pockets.  Yeah.  Fix your own problems, and then go after us again.  But we got a couple highlights from the Obama Health Care News Conference.  Fantastic.  This is going down in one form or another.  This health care thing is going down.  I think they say they got the votes.  They do have the votes?  They say they do.  I don't know.  I think they have to change some things, though. 
[00:38:30]  Danny's just finding now horrific tits, and there's a girl blowing two guys.  Of course she's got to blow two guys.  Look at the boobs.  Of course she has to do that.  All right.  Here we go.  A couple highlights from the Obama Health Care News Conference.  I do think it's important to get this right. 
[00:39:00]  Really?  What does that mean, by the way, get this right?  To get this right instead of getting it wrong.  But what does that mean?  Yeah.  Get it right.  I guess he means having good health care.  I don't know.  And why do we have to rush this through?  Yeah.  I mean, he's got four years.  Why don't we slow down a little bit?  Slow down.  I mean, he's trying to change everything immediately.  Yeah.  Let's slow down a little bit.  Oh, God.  Why are they on a plate?  Because they can be.  Those are flappy.  But she's too young to have flappy. 
[00:39:30]  Yeah.  Flat boobs.  It looks like they've been put into that hydraulic press that crushed the Terminator.  If, at the end of the day, I do not yet see that we have it right, then I'm not going to sign a bill that, for example, adds to our deficit.  Oh, Bill.  I won't sign a bill that doesn't reduce health care inflation so that families, as well as government, are saving money. 
[00:40:00]  I'm not going to sign a bill that I don't think will work.  And my measure of whether things work or not are listening to the American people, but also listening to health care experts who have shown that in some communities, health care is cheaper and delivers a better result.  Really?  Really?  Did he say anything there?  I, I, I, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. 
[00:40:30]  He said he's not going to sign it.  I heard all that a lot.  He's not going to sign it if, but he will sign it.  He's got to sign it.  He's not going to sign it if it doesn't work.  But the thing is, he, like, he's saying it'll work.  Yeah.  So, that doesn't mean anything.  Why is Kenny running to the microphone?  Because I'm happy.  I just want to congratulate you guys that, you know, yesterday you did a show dedicated on health care.  And then, obviously, the president is following your lead and is discussing health care now. 
[00:41:00]  Oh, was that why he did it?  Yes.  Yes.  So, I'm very proud of you guys that, once again, you are innovators.  Congratulations.  Kudos.  Kudos.  It's like having crushed glass funneled into your urethra.  Can't you just take a compliment graciously? 
[00:41:30]  I guess the problem we had with this whole thing was you couldn't, you basically ran over a bunch of people to get to that microphone.  He ran in here to get to that mic.  I'm like, I'm happy for you guys.  I got to stop everything because I got a doozy.  Yeah, I'm happy for you guys, you know.  We get it.  Yeah, got it.  Well, I just want to point out, like, when you do a good deed.  Right.  Sometimes you just got to stand in the ditch.  There's no digging out of it. 
[00:42:00]  I'd rather scrape my teeth against a brick wall.  Ow.  Thank you, Kenny.  That's great.  Let's see if the phones work.  Wow.  We got John in Huntington.  John, I need to know, how close are you to FH Riley's?  How close am I?  Yes.  Probably about five minutes away.  Five lousy minutes from all that goodness.  So why isn't he there?  Because we're not open for breakfast. 
[00:42:30]  We don't need to be open for breakfast.  There's a frequent spot for me and a bunch of my friends.  Oh, thank you, John.  So what do you got for the show today?  Oh, you were talking about girls with ugly tits.  Yeah.  Even having youth on their side.  Yeah.  I had a girlfriend back in college where she had the ugliest.  She had rocket tits.  They were unproportionately sized.  Disproportionately.  I was about 32B. 
[00:43:00]  And they were just ridiculous.  I don't know how.  Is there, um.  Are the phones still broken?  I wish they were.  That was a test call.  Wow.  That's how we fail to show.  Wow.  That was just an awful call.  Sean in Illinois.  Sean.  What's going on, guys?  Hey, what's up?  Help us out.  Hey, I was listening yesterday and I heard the doctor on there kind of stumped you guys  a bit when he was talking about Medicare operating at a 3% overhead. 
[00:43:30]  But the thing that, well, I didn't really hear anybody bring up that I thought could have  got him a bit was that's because it's the entire country paying in out of our taxes just  for the benefits of a small percentage, which is the elderly.  And, um, you know, if you, whatever, you're going to add every single person in the entire  country on that.  I just can't see how that we could operate, you know, with an overhead.  So now you, you, wait a minute. 
[00:44:00]  You think we didn't address that?  I remember addressing that three or four times.  I said, yes, it works.  Another thing, though.  Um.  Whatever.  Another thing.  So I worked with a guy from England and he said that, uh, with their, with their health  case, that if you get the flu or something, forget about getting in, you have a waiting  period.  If you call just to get a checkup or something, you're going to be waiting at least six, eight  weeks to get in.  Yeah.  That's the, that's the other side of it that no one wants to really talk about.  Yeah.  Plus in Canada, their, uh, cancer death rate is 16% higher than, than here in the United 
[00:44:30]  States.  That's a fact that, uh.  Once again, the other side of the issue that no one really wants to discuss.  You're absolutely right there.  He said they had a minute, uh, their breast cancer reduction rate.  Their cure rate was a little higher than us.  I'm not saying that's right.  That's just what he said.  Hey, uh, what, and the, and the good doctor yesterday, I got to go to Ann on this cause  I don't, I don't know this stuff that well, but I hear that 94% of the country has healthcare.  Is that true?  Wow. 
[00:45:00]  I can't believe it.  Right.  Is that one of the numbers that he spewed out yesterday?  And then he said on, under Obama's plan, then, then we would move that number up to about  97%.  We're only talking about, we're only talking about a small percentage of people.  Uh, people, uh, getting healthcare that don't have healthcare now under this system.  I don't know how true that is.  It's not true because there's no way the country.  You don't think.  I know.  No way.  Yeah.  I know.  Every comedian I know doesn't have it.  You can't just go.  Yeah, but you're comedians.  But major healthcare, like you're covered for like an emergency emergency.  See, you guys laugh at cancer. 
[00:45:30]  You don't need healthcare.  That's true.  Laughter is the best medicine.  That's right.  They say it all the time, Jimmy.  Um.  There's a lot of things.  But no, you know, most comics I know don't have healthcare.  All right.  So here's a question today.  We like asking questions every day.  What percentage of America has healthcare?  Yeah.  That's it.  Very easy question.  And what, and what, and how high will that percentage go under Obama's plan here?  100.  100%.  What do you think the percentage is, Jimmy?  I would say.  Let's guess. 
[00:46:00]  I would guess that.  65.  Probably.  Yeah, yeah.  Somewhere around there.  No, I think it's got to be a lot higher than 65.  For real.  Already have it?  Yeah.  70 maybe?  Think about it.  Think about it.  Think about it.  All right.  We'll try to answer that question today.  More Obama healthcare news conference audio.  I understand how easy it is for this town to become consumed in the game of politics.  To turn every issue.  Yeah, really?  Do you?  Do you understand that?  I can't listen to politicians anymore. 
[00:46:30]  You like when they refer to Washington as this town?  This town.  I can't listen to them talk anymore.  This village.  They're not human beings.  No.  Even Obama, who came aboard as this great speaker, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  I'm going to bail everybody out.  He's a decent speaker.  He's not great.  Decent, right.  Well.  I understand how easy it is for this town to become consumed in the game of politics.  To turn every issue into a running tally of who's up and who's down.  I've heard that one Republican strategist told his party that even though they may want 
[00:47:00]  to compromise, it's better politics to go for the kill.  Another Republican senator that defeating healthcare reform is about breaking me.  So let me be clear.  This isn't about me.  I have great health insurance.  And so does every member of Congress.  This debate is about the letters I read when I sit in the Oval Office every day.  Oh, shut up.  You don't read letters in the Oval Office.  He's sitting there.  First of all, no one fucking sends letters anymore.  He's sitting there just reading letters. 
[00:47:30]  Really?  Yeah.  Of course he is.  That's what he does.  You don't believe that?  No.  No.  Not for a second.  He's just sitting there.  Let me open up a letter.  It's my little letter opener.  Let me just kind of...  Dear Obama.  I love how these guys try to portray themselves as the average Joe, the average guy.  Yeah, yeah.  Just sitting around opening letters.  That's what he wanted.  From the people of America.  No.  He's got people that work for him.  Layers and layers of people. 
[00:48:00]  He's doing the healthcare thing.  All right.  I need to personalize this thing.  Find me a fucking letter from someone that is down on their luck.  Yeah.  So I could use this as an example to represent the entire issue.  15.3% of the United States residents did not have health insurance in 2007.  I would swear the guy said 94 yesterday.  It was 19% in 2005.  Okay.  It was 20.2% in 2006.  15.3% in 2007.  So that's 80...  85%.  80 to 85%. 
[00:48:30]  Yeah, call it 85.  Let's round it up.  All right.  So it's 85%.  That's pretty damn good.  Yeah.  Let's just leave it alone.  It really isn't that bad.  You're right.  85% of anything, you would take that.  Right?  Yeah.  Sure.  I do like that Obama said, I have great health coverage.  And so is a member of Congress because they never seem to look at the fact that they're  getting what they need.  Yeah.  But he's using that as like...  Maybe, but it is true.  I think it's pretty much...  And the Republicans in Congress have health insurance.  Yeah.  And you break down that 15% that don't have it. 
[00:49:00]  You're going to find that weird area when you're like, you're almost an adult and you're  off your parents' health insurance.  We all went through that 10-year period of, holy shit, please don't get sick.  It's like, I hope nothing happens.  Right.  Right.  Yeah.  I would love to know what percentage of that is in there.  Yeah.  And then where's the rest of them?  The poor, I guess.  Right?  Yeah.  The downtrodden.  But they're poor.  Yeah.  Scrum.  I was poor.  I figured it out. 
[00:49:30]  Yeah.  You're poor.  You figure it out.  I was very poor.  Don't trip on a curb.  No.  Who hasn't used duct tape to close a wound or crazy glue or fucking do stuff?  I should get Brett on the phone.  He hasn't had health insurance because he's in the restaurant business.  That's really tough.  Now he's got health insurance because he has to because he's got workers and he owns a place.  But he worked his balls off from 15 to 30-something without health insurance.  Yeah.  So you got, it's amazing the amount of surgery he's done on himself. 
[00:50:00]  It's amazing.  It's amazing.  For real.  Self-surgery.  Like I told you, I did the same thing.  I had an abscessed tooth.  And I put a drill screw through it.  I heard you say that yesterday.  And we kind of went by that because the show was moving too fast.  It was like on my gum.  What do you mean?  So you put a screw in your gum?  So I just took a drill screw.  Right.  And they're very sharp.  Sheet metal screw.  Right.  And put it against it and just kind of gave it a turn with my hand and lanced it. 
[00:50:30]  What?  Yeah, because it was all infected.  So you left a screw in there?  No, no.  Oh, you had a, I see what you're saying.  Poked it and then.  To get the pus and shit out.  Yeah, yeah.  Okay, all right.  I got you.  Because it was throbbing.  Did it help?  That's like the first one, Dan.  Yeah.  Did it help?  Oh, my God.  The pain instantly went away.  Really?  It was throbbing, hurting.  Then it just went.  Yeah.  And then I was done.  That was my health care.  A drill screw.  We all become amateur surgeons when you don't have health care. 
[00:51:00]  You have to.  What do you do?  You dump a lot of alcohol on shit, right?  Yeah.  A lot of peroxide.  Yeah.  I had, yeah.  I cut my hand open all the time working with sheet metal and used to just take like a piece  of metal and duct tape it over the cut.  Right.  So then I could work.  Yeah.  And it was like armor plated, you know.  Mm-hmm.  Wouldn't hurt yourself with it.  Amazing.  Here's more Obama reading letters in the Oval Office.  I'm going to sit here and believe this.  Yeah.  He's reading.  He's wandering the world. 
[00:51:30]  When does he have time to.  Yeah.  I played golf yesterday with Rich Voss.  My entire life fell apart.  I'm like, oh, my God.  I got so much to do.  And he's the president.  But he has time to read letters.  Just kicking back reading letters.  Right.  Stop it.  I blew off so much shit for a lousy round of golf.  But he has time to read letters.  Such bullshit.  From citizens.  Of Congress.  This debate is about the letters I read when I sit in the Oval Office every day.  And the stories I hear at town hall meetings.  This is about the woman in Colorado who paid $700 a month to her insurance company. 
[00:52:00]  Only to find out that they wouldn't pay a dime for her cancer treatment.  Who had to use up her retirement funds to save her own life.  So fixing the insurance company.  This is about every family, every business, and every taxpayer.  Who continues to shoulder the burden of a problem that Washington has failed to solve for decades.  This debate is not a game for these Americans.  And they can't afford to wait any longer for reform.  They're counting on us to get this done.  They're looking to us for leadership.  And we can't let them down. 
[00:52:30]  We will pass reform that lowers cost, promotes choice, and provides coverage that every American can count on.  And we will do it this year.  I like what he's saying, even though I don't like the raising taxes for everybody.  But that is the way those fucking vulture insurance companies are, man.  Well, is he going after those people?  I hope so.  Is that part of his plan?  I would hope so.  Because even if you have health insurance, you're paying a lot of money.  Yeah.  That premium shit.  I'm like, what do you mean it's the co-pay or whatever? 
[00:53:00]  What are you talking about?  Yeah, that.  How do they get the co-pay through?  And then the premiums just go up every few months.  They go, oh, yeah, we're going to raise it.  When I was going through that prostate bullshit, every time I went into the office, it was a $50 co-pay.  And what are you talking about?  I'm insured.  How do they get the co-pay past everybody?  That's not a co-pay.  I'm paying this.  They go, oh, wow, these people are all insured.  We've got to figure out how to get more money out of them.  Yeah.  Co-pay.  All right, let's go with the co-pay. 
[00:53:30]  And then they get a prescription filled.  It's like, oh, that's $100.  But I got a prescription plan.  Yeah, if you didn't have that, it would be $200.  No, it should be fucking free pills.  Don't you think that's just like tipping the doctor?  Yes, of course it is.  What is cash?  Yeah, where's that cash go?  Where's it going?  Absolutely.  He's going home buying gas with it and stuff.  Oh, I guarantee.  That's where that co-pay goes.  I guarantee.  He just puts it in his pocket in a big wad at the end of the day.  And then they give you that receipt that doesn't look like a real receipt. 
[00:54:00]  Yeah.  There's your receipt.  That receipt.  Where do you get that receipt from?  What is that?  It's the oldie time, 1950s receipt.  I mean, you give that to your accountant and they're like, this isn't a real receipt.  One more here from Obama's health care news conference.  What we did very early on was say two-thirds of the costs of health care reform, which  includes providing coverage for people who don't have it, making it more affordable for  folks who do, and making sure that we're, over the long term, creating the kinds of 
[00:54:30]  systems where prevention and wellness and information technologies make the system more  efficient, that the entire cost of that has to be paid for and it's got to be deficit-neutral.  And we identified two-thirds of those costs to be paid for by tax dollars that are already  being spent right now.  So taxpayers are already putting this money into the kitty.  The problem is they're not getting a good deal for the money they're spending.  That takes care of about two-thirds of the costs.  The remaining one-third is what the argument has been about of late. 
[00:55:00]  What I've said is that there may be a number of different ways to raise money.  I put forward what I thought was the best proposal, which was to limit the deductions, the itemized  deductions, for the wealthiest Americans.  Raising taxes.  People like myself could take the same percentage deduction that middle-class families do, and  that would raise sufficient funds for that final one-third. 
[00:55:30]  Limit the deductions.  Look how he just said, raise taxes.  Look how that motherfucker just said, raise taxes, without saying, raise taxes.  That's raising taxes.  Sure is.  New boss, same as the old boss.  Yeah, of course.  There he is.  It's just a different color.  There's the savior.  Unbelievable.  What do you do?  What do you do?  There's nothing you can do.  You just sit there and just spread them.  Yeah.  Just spread your cheeks. 
[00:56:00]  That's why you've got to take up a hobby, like golf or something.  It's a nice distraction.  Yeah, just talk about it.  Exactly.  It's a very good distraction.  Exactly.  Let me say hi to Sean in Georgia.  Sean, are you going to go see little Jimmy Norton?  He's going to be down in your area, sort of.  Atlanta area.  That's Georgia.  No, I know.  It's part of Georgia, but Georgia's a big state, is what I'm saying.  He might be really far from Atlanta.  Where are you going to be?  How far are you from Atlanta, sir?  I'm three and a half hours.  Sorry, that's close.  That's close enough.  Go see Jimmy this weekend.  I have a late show tonight, 10 o'clock, so leave at 6.30.  You walk right in as the show starts, and you walk in on the theme music. 
[00:56:30]  And then you have shows over by 12.  You can be home by 3.30 in the morning and get up for work.  It's perfect.  Good seven hours of driving.  You have a few drinks.  You drive home.  I'll be there.  I do my eight-hour stand-up comedy routine.  Hopefully it's one long highway with a lot of lanes.  Yeah, a lot of lanes.  All easy pass.  As you drive home drunk.  I do the same jokes in five different languages.  It's a really extended, fun show.  I juggle balloons filled with piss.  Listen.  Listen, I'll say this much. 
[00:57:00]  We hear from a lot of listeners in the Atlanta area.  If you don't go to Jimmy's show and show some love, this is your chance, finally.  That's right.  Because a lot of people go, when are you guys coming down here?  Do a show live from Atlanta.  Let's see how you treat Jimmy, and then we'll go from there.  We'll send out our reconnaissance man, Jimmy Norton.  We get someone from Atlanta.  I can't tell you how many fans are down this area.  It's unbelievable.  I see the WOW stickers.  You guys are pretty big down here.  All right.  We'll see.  It's not just Georgia.  I live in there.  It's not just Atlanta. 
[00:57:30]  It's all of Georgia.  I'll drive all over the place and down here in southwest Georgia.  Well, that's why I propose buses for the show.  I've been saying that for years.  I want buses bringing up Georgians to the show.  Georgians.  And North Floridians.  We want SiriusXM to have an Opie and Anthony campaign where they just promote our show in  North Georgia.  North Georgia.  And to Floridians.  And South Florida.  That's all we want.  Which is just two out-of-the-way places. 
[00:58:00]  All right, Sean.  What do you got?  I got a horrible boobie story for you.  Yeah.  I met this girl one night at the bar, and we ended up going back to her place.  And we get there, and we're making out.  She sits up, and she takes her shirt off.  And she's got about one mid-C and a small B.  Wow.  And the small B, the nipple had to take up at least half of it.  Oh, my God.  Did you call them Laurel and Hardy? 
[00:58:30]  I just said no.  I just had to leave.  Oh, wow.  Wah, wah, wah, wah.  Oh, wow.  Give that girl a complex.  Yeah.  Wow.  The worst boobs I ever encountered was the famous girl that was, she had full C's bordering  on D's with absolutely no areola nipple area.  Really?  Just?  Because it was the same color as the rest of her breasts.  Oh, the fade.  Yeah. 
[00:59:00]  It wasn't even a fade.  It was nothing?  It was almost non-existent.  And very, very tiny, tiny, like, a very tiny area to begin with.  That's weird on big tits.  No kidding.  Put in big tits, small nipples, Danny.  Let's see what happens.  Oh, please.  It's like hot lead and cold feet.  It's a Don Knotts movie.  All right.  Sonny Farrelly.  Hey, guys.  Hey, listen.  Sonny, first of all, you've been with us a long time.  One instant feedback. 
[00:59:30]  Enough.  Really.  And secondly, we're not avoiding this story in Boston.  We don't even really know about it.  Yeah, we're talking about other stuff.  Why would we avoid anything?  Okay.  The record shows that we don't really avoid stuff.  Let the record show.  Yeah, maybe every once in a while.  But especially news stories.  So maybe it's not really on our radar.  So maybe you bring it to our attention now.  That's right.  Well, you know, I got kind of frustrated this morning because of the phone.  They tried to call us in first thing.  You're going to hold to yourself. 
[01:00:00]  And the fucking phones weren't.  They were unraveling.  So anyways, listen.  What's going on here in Boston is that this is a well-known college professor, Professor Gates.  Okay.  And he was arrested for disorderly conduct.  And now he's playing the race card.  Yeah.  Now, is this the guy, because I heard a little bit about this, is this the guy that tried to break into his own home?  Yeah.  Or it was perceived that he was breaking into a house, but I guess what?  He didn't have his keys or something. 
[01:00:30]  He was just trying to get into his own house.  That's right.  That's right.  He's trying to get his own house.  His driver, who is also of color.  Big blacker, yeah.  Yep.  Trying to break into his own house.  And then these two old ladies, I guess, that were walking down the street, walking their dogs, caught these two people trying to break into a house.  So they called the police.  The police came.  He shows the police his ID.  He shows his college ID.  Oh, he did show his ID. 
[01:01:00]  He did.  He did.  He showed his ID.  But then, you know, he was irate about it.  He was definitely irate about it, because there's witnesses out there that saw him being irate about the fact that, you know, he just got right on the defensive.  You know, he started screaming like a lot of the people, like some of the other people would scream when they get pulled over and they get maced, they get tased.  Well, I heard that he, you know, I heard that when the cops showed up, he refused to show ID or identify himself. 
[01:01:30]  I heard he was belligerent.  And then they arrested him.  Was he arrested?  Yes, he was.  He was arrested.  He drives with disorderly conduct, and it was dropped.  But now Sonny is saying that, no, he did show his ID.  But then started going like, hey, why are you, you know, giving me shit or something?  Well, what did they do after he showed his ID?  If he said, I live here, I lock myself out, here's my ID.  Yeah, I want to know what happened.  Well, because he's a college professor, and he talks, that's what he talks about, that's what he teaches. 
[01:02:00]  He started going off on these police officers saying, you know, just because of the color of my skin, you decided to come here and you assume that I'm breaking into a house?  Well, that's pretty stupid.  Sounds to me, it sounds to me like, I heard he wants to do something on racial profiling, and it just sounds to me like a real convenient time to have a flare-up and then all of a sudden do something about racial profiling.  Yeah, exactly.  Maybe he saw an opportunity.  Well, the thing that kind of got heated up about is the fact that the police officer, who's actually a sergeant that arrested him, all right, he refuses to apologize for the whole situation. 
[01:02:30]  He what?  He refuses to apologize for the whole situation.  All right, hold on, a cop is saying you have the story wrong.  Okay.  I'm going to put you on the line with Keith, the other cop.  Keith.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  I read the police report.  I'm a cop in New York.  Okay.  What it was is that he showed just his Harvard ID, which is not proof of residence.  Okay.  And that's what the problem was. 
[01:03:00]  And from what the police report states, this guy was belligerent from the get-go.  Why did you stop me?  Is it because I'm a black man?  But Professor Gates is a Harvard professor in the African-American Studies Department.  I did a little research on it.  Oh, boy.  All right.  Well, good for the cop to not apologize.  Because there was no—the guy—if you're breaking into a house and they want to see  your ID, even if the cop's a dick—I'm not saying he was, but even if he is, that's 
[01:03:30]  a legitimate thing for a cop to want to see.  Of course it is.  You should be happy.  You should be happy that they were there.  And also, just remember one thing.  This guy was responding to a call.  Right.  It wasn't something that he generated himself.  Yeah.  I heard the guy start saying, do you know who I am?  I guess he's a Harvard professor.  Who gives a shit?  Show your ID.  If you're a math professor, should you not have to show your ID to prove the other?  Explain why you're breaking into this house.  I mean, if you look at the police report, it's pretty—I mean, it's pretty lengthy with  all the stuff that this cop wrote.  Right.  I mean, he actually reiterates parts of the conversations between him and Professor Gates. 
[01:04:00]  And Obama, apparently.  Obama's involved in this?  He shot his big mouth off.  Are you kidding?  Yeah, he wasn't there.  He probably just got a call from this guy.  He's friends with him.  He read a letter.  What?  In the Oval Office during his letter reading.  Does Obama know this guy personally?  Yes.  He said that the Cambridge police acted stupidly.  So, of course, he sides against the cops.  Why do they act stupidly?  I don't know.  Why did Obama say they acted stupidly? 
[01:04:30]  Did you see somebody breaking into a house?  Well, why did Obama say it?  Well, let's guess.  No, I understand all that.  I can figure that out.  But what is his reasoning?  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  I don't know.  Professor Gates, instead of being irate about, you know, and playing the race card, he should  have been grateful to the police for checking out the situation instead of playing the race  card.  And now that Obama's involved, a lot of people will be fired.  That's just how it works in this world.  And what?  And what?  Gates wanted an apology from the officer and the officer refuses? 
[01:05:00]  Yep.  Yep.  That's exactly right.  Guys, am I still on?  All right.  Keith?  Yeah, there's no way this guy just wants an apology.  He wants a payoff.  It's obvious that they're already assessing their options, quote unquote.  Right.  You know what that means?  It's going to be a federal lawsuit, you know, violation of civil rights, blah, blah, blah.  And it's the residents of Cambridge that are the real victims here because they're going  to have to pay for this nonsense.  What is the mayor saying?  They showed, like, the mayor of Cambridge or something saying something.  Oh, I thought Mayor Menino.  No, no.  Oh, my God.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, 
[01:05:30]  Is Mayor Menino involved in any way?  Just because, you know, he's the mayor of Boston, which is very close to Cambridge, obviously.  He's not the mayor of Boston.  He's the mayor of Bofferson.  Oh, Bofferson.  I'm sorry.  What?  I haven't heard anything from Mayor Menino yet, but I'm sure he's going to comment about it.  Yeah.  You think he will?  I think he'll hide.  Rudy Giuliani reacts.  Rudy Giuliani.  What do you think Rudy's going to say?  Is this to the health care issue or that situation?  I don't know.  All right, Sonny.  Now you brought it to our attention, all right? 
[01:06:00]  There you go.  We're not avoiding anything.  I didn't want to talk about that.  All right, boys.  This is Keith.  I'm checking out.  See you guys later.  Thank you, Keith.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  I love you.  All right.  Sonny Ferelli, everyone.  We just got off on the wrong foot today, Sonny.  Why?  It's all good.  You know, the guy, the cops got a call that people were breaking into a house.  So they go to investigate it.  So he shows him ID with no proof that he lives there and then starts getting belligerent and 
[01:06:30]  the cops arrest him.  Where's the problem?  Yeah.  The cops arrest him to control the situation and then they figure it out afterwards, right?  How about you just...  And then it dropped all charges anyway, right?  End of story.  For sure.  But how about you just say, oh, officers, yeah, this is my house.  Here's ID.  If you don't have ID on you, I'm sure you could speak to them nicely.  He didn't like it because he's a Harvard professor.  Exactly.  And he didn't like some fucking blue-collar white cops questioning him.  Yeah. 
[01:07:00]  He's used to speaking and having people bow down at his brilliant intellect.  Exactly.  And he wasn't used to this fucking blue-collar cop who didn't give a fuck, who gets a call,  guys breaking into a house.  And he was probably...  You know how professors are.  How much fun are they?  None.  They're not.  None fun.  Let's go to Tom and...  How do you say it?  Bofferson.  Bofferson.  Yeah.  Bofferson.  Tom, what do you got?  How are you doing?  This professor there, when he went into the house finally, he kept asking the officer for 
[01:07:30]  his badge number and his name.  The officer wouldn't give it to him, so he came outside, and when he did come outside,  that's finally when the police arrested him for disorderly conduct.  Oh.  Why wouldn't the cop give his badge number and name?  I have no idea.  No idea at all.  Well, maybe because he was a little busy trying to figure out what the F is going on.  All right, boys.  Have a good day.  Get the taser. 
[01:08:00]  Joe in Tennessee.  Joe?  Yeah, you've got to listen to the last question of the news conference.  A reporter from Chicago was picked out.  She directly addressed that question.  It had nothing to do with health care.  Asked Obama what he thought about the incident in Cambridge.  Joe, Obama had a set answer.  You can hear it.  Yeah.  And he said people of color are picked out.  And what, Joe?  I missed the last couple seconds there.  He said people of color, Hispanics and blacks, are picked out disproportionately. 
[01:08:30]  Obama said that?  Yeah.  Yes, he did.  Listen to the last question of the news conference.  I'd like to hear that.  Yeah, he did say it.  I read the quote.  And if you believe in that, whatever.  But in this case.  Yeah, this doesn't even apply.  It has nothing to do with this case.  You've got someone breaking into a home.  A few old ladies are walking by.  Oh, my God.  Someone's breaking into that house.  I'll do the right thing because this is my community.  I called the cops.  And the cops are like, what the fuck's going on?  I've got to figure this shit out. 
[01:09:00]  If the cops didn't show up, they'd be all pissed off.  He'd be like, what happened?  I got home.  My house was robbed.  Where were the police?  They don't show up in my neighborhood.  Why?  I'm a black man.  And that is important because they were responding to a call.  Can't win for losing.  So they get a call that someone's bringing into a house.  And then the cops are supposed to what?  Not do anything about it?  Then their jobs are on the line, right?  I don't know what kind of a lunatic you have to be to even be a cop in this day and age. 
[01:09:30]  You end up in prison.  You could end up in prison just for doing your job.  Let me say hi to John.  John.  Hi, John.  John.  Hi, John.  Hi, John.  John.  Hey, how are you guys?  Hey, buddy.  Hey, do you know how racist this cop is?  No.  He's the cop who performed mouth-to-mouth the day Reggie Lewis collapsed on the floor and died.  Did you do it on Reggie Lewis?  Yeah.  Wait, for real? 
[01:10:00]  Yeah, that's for real.  It's all over the news this morning.  This is a guy 16 years ago.  Reggie Lewis dropped dead.  This is a guy performing mouth-to-mouth.  He's a real racist.  Wow.  Yeah.  Jesus.  That was such a tragic story, and this was the cop that was on the scene.  Holy crap.  I didn't know that.  Good for him.  Profiling, Ben?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Real racial profiling.  All right.  See you, guys.  All right.  Let's go to Scott in New York.  Scott.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey, squat.  I heard about this story when it first broke a few days ago, and I guess now the Reverend 
[01:10:30]  Ale wants to get involved in it.  Oh, good.  Good.  Thank God.  I wonder if he'd weigh in.  Why?  What?  Did he get bored with the Michael Jackson corpse?  Yeah, that's done.  He's not getting enough press.  If that doesn't prove that there's Reverend Ale as an opportunist, the Michael Jackson  story is finally getting a little cold, like the body, so Reverend Ale's going to now  move on to something else that keeps his face in the news.  What a joke that guy is.  All right, guys.  I guess the whole Michael Jackson thing is taken care of, right?  Yeah, that's all done.  It's an old hat.  Yeah, now that the news cameras have more or less gone away, it's time for Reverend Ale 
[01:11:00]  to find, you know, the next one that keeps him on TV.  Those words are brilliant, Ant, many days later.  Yes.  Still relevant.  All right.  Let's say hi to Jeff on Long Island.  Jeff.  Hey, what's going on?  Hi, Jeffy.  I just wanted to say that, you know, nobody's bringing up that some of the cops that were  on scene at that whole Cambridge thing were black as well.  So this guy's freaking out over, you know, being racially profiled. 
[01:11:30]  Meanwhile, there were black officers there.  That never seems to matter.  Yeah, which is very strange to me.  It doesn't matter.  I guess if you're a cop, you're not really black.  No, that's just it.  You're not looked at as, you know.  That's kind of the feeling I get for these poor black officers.  They're actually considered white now.  Yeah, they use the term Uncle Tom a lot.  Yeah, because they're in uniform.  They're not really black guys anymore.  Traitors.  Which is so fucking strange to me.  Well, they separate themselves.  They have an organization called 100 Blacks in Law Enforcement.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[01:12:00]  Those are very militant little group there.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  All right.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  I'm punching out.  Thank you.  All right.  Yeah, we'll keep an eye on that story.  As it develops.  As it develops.  It's developing.  I would crank it to this picture.  Which picture?  I don't know.  Now I just found, like, pictures of perky tits and stuff like that.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  She's really hot.  I got a one.  Who is she?  I don't know. 
[01:12:30]  Those are some nice boobies.  It just came up under perky tits, black thong.  Let me see.  Nice.  Yeah.  She's got a really cocky look on her face.  Yeah, yeah.  Cocky.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I like to give her.  All right.  We're going to go to break with this.  That's her right there.  Nice, right?  Yeah, very nice.  We're going to go to break with this from your Obama rant yesterday.  Oh.  The boys did a little something, something.  I think this is Butcher.  Opie and Anthony. 
[01:13:00]  All right.  How's everyone today?  Good.  In case you're tuning in for the first time.  Oh, God.  What happened?  We were talking about, during commercial break there, we were talking about MySpace, Twitter,  Facebook, illusions. 
[01:13:30]  The girls that kind of put pictures up.  And it's very deceptive.  Is that a real one?  That?  It's titled MySpace.  Jesus fucking Christ.  There's a blonde.  It's a picture of Tori, who, in the picture on the left, she's a blonde.  She's got the nice shades on, kind of like the hip shades on, and she's leaning over  and showing a lot of cleavage.  Looks very, very good.  Kind of a fat neck, but...  You know what? 
[01:14:00]  Yeah.  Even in the picture on the left, you should be a bit, you know, leery.  Big girl.  Because there is some pelican action happening with her neck.  Yeah, yeah.  There's definitely suspicion going on there.  But nothing could prepare you for the entire picture.  The full shot.  It is...  She is giant.  Giant.  Yeah, she's as big...  Big fatty.  She's as big as the girl that did that TV commercial with us.  Bigger.  Bigger, even.  I'd say she's bigger.  You think she's even bigger? 
[01:14:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  The other girl is actually doable in a weird kind of way.  I agree.  Yeah, and I...  I agree.  You know, not into that.  So agree.  But, uh...  Yeah, it's happening out there.  Yeah.  Everyone misrepresenting themselves.  What's worse than that?  When you pull the camera back and you see that they're a mess, you're like, ugh.  You get that angle shot from above.  Oh, my God.  That's fantastic. 
[01:15:00]  That girl looks retarded.  Same girl.  She's making, like, some kind of trying to be sexy, leaning her head back on a pillow.  The camera's taking a shot from way under her chin.  And then they show her face, and she looks Japanese retarded.  Yeah, something's going on there.  It's like a retarded Japanese girl.  Why are we talking about the stripper thing?  What stripper thing?  Stripper thing.  What?  Travis sent out a news story last night that you could now strip if you're 17 years old 
[01:15:30]  in Rhode Island.  Yeah, I heard this.  Is this true, Travis?  Yes, it is.  You can strip.  He's making peeps.  You can strip.  There's no one in there.  What's going on with Travis?  He's diabetic.  Something's going on with Travis.  The two times we needed him, he was gone.  Weewee problems.  No, I did hear this, though.  They lower the age, or the age was always 17?  What's going on there?  There's no law against it.  Yeah. 
[01:16:00]  Okay, so what's the big deal?  And they weren't able to arrest anybody.  They realized, oh, my God, we can't do anything.  I heard it was 16, by the way.  16 years old, and you could be stripping in the Rhode Island boobie bars.  I say, let's take a road trip, because that's going to go away quick.  Yeah, I know, right?  They're going to put the kibosh on that fund.  You bet they are.  Yeah, you don't want that on the radar.  Quirky laws?  I don't think that's one of those quirky laws, like, you can't carry a groundhog in your  pocket on Sunday in this town.  It's a 16-year-old stripper. 
[01:16:30]  The dumb quirky law.  Oh, I hate those.  I'm sure I did it years ago.  Everyone in radio has done it.  I'm sure I've done it.  Did you hear about this law that's on the books here in Wisconsin?  Ugh.  Oh, it's hysterical.  You're not allowed to chew gum if you're walking on Main Street.  You can actually be arrested if you're wearing two left shoes to church.  Yeah.  What?  Like, the cops are looking for that.  All right.  To tase you, put the knee on the back of your neck. 
[01:17:00]  It's not fun in any way to discuss it, to do it, to arrest the people.  It's just annoying for everybody.  Except for this law.  The 16-year-old stripper law.  Yeah.  Not 17, it's 16.  Okay.  And apparently teen prostitution.  What?  Indoors is legal.  Yeah.  What?  In Rhode Island.  A 16-year-old cannot drive without an adult in the car.  But I guess you can, what, strip and be a prostitute? 
[01:17:30]  Drive a penis right into your vagina.  Well, it says that prostitution is only illegal when the solicitation is done outdoors.  Yeah.  So I suppose if a 16- or 17-year-old girl, because the legal age in Rhode Island is 16, so I guess if they're stripping indoors and they're soliciting indoors in a private area, that's perfectly fine.  Like a brothel is legal, or is it all through the internet?  You can't, the girl can't tell you that she's a prostitute kind of a thing.  Like you have to, you kind of know, and then you've got to go to her and go, hey, you know, 20 bucks, sunk my dick. 
[01:18:00]  And it can't be done outside on the street.  That's silly.  It's got to be done like inside an establishment or a house.  This is what I heard.  All right.  And I heard that from my realtor.  So I was buying a home in Rhode Island.  Let's go to Rhode Island.  Norman.  Hey, boys.  What's going on?  Hey, Norman.  She's a whore, Norman.  Yeah, I work in Providence. 
[01:18:30]  And it's true.  It's 16 years old, and they can do it until 11 o'clock at night because they have to have a work permit.  And the work permit only goes until 11.  And the prostitution, as long as it's indoors, and like Ann said, they can't proposition you on the streets, but if it's indoors, then the prostitution's legal.  And that just goes right along with our oriental massage happy-ending industry that is flourishing in Providence.  So, Jimmy, this is the perfect city for you.  It sounds great.  We'll find you an apartment.  Yeah, I hear the streets are just lined with jizz. 
[01:19:00]  No, they're like lined with these massage parlors?  Yeah, there's a ton of oriental massage parlors.  There's like a newspaper out here, The Phoenix.  I don't know if you guys have it down there.  And it advertises a lot of them, and you can go on Craigslist for the hookers, and it's just crazy.  Who would have thought a northeast city would be like the worst in Vegas?  And apparently this has been on the books for a while, and it's come up for votes every so often, but it never gets taken off the books. 
[01:19:30]  It's like they don't – no one wants to rock the boat on that one, huh?  No, they all stand up and stick their chests out and huff and puff, but then once they get off the podium, they head to the nearest massage parlors.  Yeah, exactly, because I think the politicians are the ones that are going to these places.  I'm sure.  All right, thank you, sir.  You know, if they were involved in illegal activities, there'd be a problem.  So they keep it legal so they can go ditch their wives and just – yeah. 
[01:20:00]  All right, let's go to Julie, who works in a strip club in Rhode Island.  Julie.  Yeah, hi.  How are you?  How are you?  Hi, Julie.  How are you?  Not bad.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Thank you, Julie.  You're welcome.  Sweet.  I've been in Rhode Island my whole life, and I own a business in Rhode Island, not a strip giant, but I'm near a strip joint.  I know very many strippers, and I know the whole deal.  About a year ago, they did try to change the law.  It's just so that, yes, it is in Rhode Island.  It is legal if you are soliciting inside. 
[01:20:30]  We have a place called Oneyville.  What's it called?  Oneyville.  Oney?  Oneyville, like O-L-N-E-Y-V-I-L-E.  I call you my accent, Oneyville.  But you'll see a lot of people from the low-end prostitutes out there trying to solicit if the cops may will bust them.  But, again, you're right.  In Rhode Island, 15 years old is the age of consent.  15 or 16?  16.  Oh, 16.  Yeah, she gets your 10-year sentence by listening to this idiot. 
[01:21:00]  The lady said.  The lady said on the Opie Dancing Show.  I heard on the phone, on the radio show.  Are you taking me in?  Oh, that is true, though.  Well, it's kind of ironic because 16 years old in the state of Rhode Island is the age of consent for sex.  Yeah.  So if they do perform at 16 years old behind closed doors, it is legal.  But what the irony is in this state is we are one of the only states.  Everyone talks about the South.  People get married at 15, 15 years old.  Rhode Island is actually one of the only states in the Union that allows marriage even with parental consent at 16 years old. 
[01:21:30]  Really?  Yeah.  I think Alabama, maybe Georgia.  Alabama.  There's only two or three other states that they allow this in, but they get away with it.  Yeah.  But they did try.  I mean, yes, they do hop and puff, but they busted a bunch of the massage.  I knew there was a ton of them.  You drive by them.  There are all these docked-out windows, and they say spa on them.  Spa?  They have one.  Spa.  There was one that actually got busted.  It was in the paper because a lot of prominent politicians put a nail there. 
[01:22:00]  It was the Midori spa, like the drink Midori in downtown Providence.  Yeah.  And a bunch of them all got busted.  And let me tell you something.  I think the closed sign was on that place for literally three days.  And literally, it's a block behind City Hall.  It's a block behind Providence City Hall.  What's going on up there in that tiny little state?  I had no idea.  Yeah.  Tax it.  Shit.  You talk to Anthony.  I agree with you 100% about your views about health care and tax basing.  And I totally agree.  You know what?  No offense. 
[01:22:30]  Tax it.  If they're going to be able to do it and make revenue off of it, and they're talking about  taking from whatever percentage of the population, tax it.  Yes.  Prostitution.  Pot.  Everything.  Let's just make everything legal and tax that.  All right.  Leave us alone.  Thank you, Julie.  No problem.  Julie letting us know what's going on in Rhode Island.  No clue.  Yes.  The buzz from Rhode Island.  I knew when we lived up there, you know, all the totally nude strip joints were right  over the Massachusetts border in Rhode Island.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I should have known just from that.  I was a little suspicious.  That shenanigans were going on. 
[01:23:00]  That in New Hampshire, right?  Shenanigans could be had.  You get right into New Hampshire.  I mean, the first thing you see usually is a strip club because it's legal.  I mean, you could get a lot more done in New Hampshire.  Totally do.  This leads to the next story.  Dan, I'm going to give you a website.  Hot T News stripping the new after school job.  Could you go to HTTP semicolon backslash backslash?  You got that so far?  jerseyshore.momslikeme.com. 
[01:23:30]  You got that so far?  No, I'll find it on the feedback.  No, no, no, no.  I'm doing a bit.  Slash members slash journal actions dot aspx.  Question mark G equals four, three, seven, one, eight, seven.  Don't you love.  Thank you.  You got it.  Don't you love when people send you links like that?  Yeah.  And you can't just click on it.  So I'm like, I have to fucking type all this in. 
[01:24:00]  And then you got that and sign that is what the apper fucking.  Apper.  All right.  M equals six, four, eight, nine, two, one, eight.  Another one of those apper things.  G, R, P, C, A, T equals capital M.  Y plus.  Does it really have to be that complicated in 2009?  Like, I don't get it.  Holy shit, David.  You're killing me. 
[01:24:30]  I'm sure it's a great link, but my God, man.  Discover something called tinyurl.com, please.  Here's a review from the Midori Spa.  Okay.  Good spa.  For $60, you get the massage and jerked off.  And they could advertise it like this?  I don't think so.  That's soliciting.  Someone put this up on CitySearch.  Okay.  But for $200, you could do anything to the girls.  They are hot, clean, and don't speak English. 
[01:25:00]  Definitely a good experience.  Sounds good.  I thought that was, you know, some advertising in the Boston Herald.  Sounds good review.  Even though we're talking about Rhode Island, but I don't know the Rhode Island newspaper.  No.  Who does?  Who does is right.  Ant, the economy is going to line the whole state with one.  The economy is going to shit.  It's all the state.  Yeah.  And it's affecting everybody.  It's getting so bad that this is happening.  You're putting CDs in the player? 
[01:25:30]  This is happening.  Oh, what's on the CD?  I got confused.  This is getting bad out there.  Listen to this one.  Or maybe not.  Just hit it hard.  Okay.  The economic crisis, of course, taking its toll on business, death, and dying.  Many bodies are going unclaimed as families aren't able to afford funeral expenses.  Who's doing that?  Stop it.  Maybe there's a handful of people.  Yeah.  Is it an epidemic? 
[01:26:00]  Is this happening, like, a lot?  Well, your relatives are dying, and you're making believe that you don't have an idea?  I don't know.  What are you talking about?  I'm not claiming that body.  Funeral expenses.  The coroner's office talked about some of the stories here.  You have a father, the breadwinner of the family, dying in a car accident, and then they  go to his home, and there's his...  Not much of a breadwinner if you're not claiming the body.  Really?  I guess he wasn't bringing too much money home. 
[01:26:30]  And then they go to his home, and there's his wife, who's a stay-at-home mom with several  kids to raise.  And if people don't know, a funeral, your average funeral just to bury somebody, is $7,000.  So you can imagine when they're already cash-strapped, or if somebody's been laid off, what people  are dealing with.  But because of this, more bodies are going unclaimed here at the morgue, and cremations  have gone up in the county of L.A.  Now, the county cremates unclaimed bodies after a month at the morgue.  Families can pay the coroner $350 to receive the ashes. 
[01:27:00]  A private cremation costs in the neighborhood of $1,000, so just by waiting to claim a loved  one's body, they save a little over $600.  Funeral homes charge around $7,000 just to transport a body and bury it in a simple grave,  and to get a headstone, things like that, costs more money.  Families who are holding funerals are often choosing cheaper coffins and holding shorter  services.  And some casket companies have stopped making the expensive models altogether because of 
[01:27:30]  the economy.  Now, last year, there were 36% more cremations done that taxpayers are paying for.  There were 712 last year.  Oh, my gosh, she's losing me.  And the year before that, it was just $525.  She sucks.  Now, as I was saying, there are many sad stories here.  It's not just people who are trying to get away with not paying much money.  A lot of people can barely afford to pay their bills.  The story's dying, and I'm not claiming it.  It's endless.  So thank for a loved one's death on top of that is what we are seeing here.  Wow, that could have been edited.  Yeah. 
[01:28:00]  I'm being called a dumbass because I don't know what copy and paste is.  Of course I know.  It was a joke about how ridiculous website addresses have become.  Yes.  So, first of all, it's completely ridiculous that you've got to go broke to bury a loved  one.  Yeah.  I didn't realize funeral costs were that high.  Seven Gs.  Seven Gs just to get the basics.  Seven large for the pine box.  But then they guilt the shit out of you, and you're pushing 10 almost every time out. 
[01:28:30]  Yeah.  And, okay, here's the question I got today.  So you don't have a lot of money.  Your loved one dies, and you're like, I can't do seven.  All right, let's call it seven Gs.  Are you allowed to dispose of the body yourself?  I don't think so.  So then what?  Who pays for it?  I think that's a crime.  Do you have to pay for it?  Like, what is the law?  Yeah, why?  No, because it's money.  You know what I'm saying?  It's a service they provide.  But if you can't afford that service, you should be able to figure out another way. 
[01:29:00]  To dispose of a loved one?  Yes!  For, like, free.  I'm not even joking.  For completely free.  Borrow your friend's boat and just dump the whole thing over the...  Dump them in the ocean?  Like, it matters where you are in the end.  You know, but that...  It's true.  Like, I never thought of that.  There should be a way you could just dispose of it like trash.  I think so.  I mean, that would be horrific, but if you're strapped for cash, you know, you should have  other options. 
[01:29:30]  Woodchipper.  What are some of these other options?  Wait for them to build some kind of arena in your town and dump it in the cement.  Acidic vat?  Yes.  You just disappear.  That's what the mob used to do.  But what is the law?  Like, they're forcing you to pay the minimum?  Because it comes down to the minimum.  So, someone dies in your family, you're forced now to, in some cases, take out your life savings 
[01:30:00]  to bury them.  And now you're in deep financial, you know, problems because you had to, quote, do the  right thing.  Penn and Teller did a great episode on bullshit about the business of death and dying.  Oh, I saw that one.  It was called Death Incorporated.  It was fantastic.  That was a great one.  And it just kind of showed you how...  Because these scumbags, unfortunately, I had to go through this process and they're all  scumbags.  They make believe they give a shit about you and your dead relative.  And then they drag you downstairs to look at coffins and, you know, they guilt you into  getting the really nice coffin, even though after the service, no one will ever see the 
[01:30:30]  fucking coffin again.  Bury it.  Right.  Imagine buying, like, a car and then burying it.  Right.  That's basically what you're doing.  Hey, what color paint is that?  You want it nice and shiny.  Yeah.  And then we'll wax it up.  Yeah.  Okay.  Now drive it into this hole and we'll bury it forever.  Yeah.  But what is it?  Seriously, what is this about?  Like, do you have to do this?  Like, are you allowed to get rid of a body another way if you don't have the money?  You have to adhere to the health laws. 
[01:31:00]  I think that's probably what the problem is.  Okay.  So what if you, can we get someone that really knows this topic?  Because I'm very curious right now about this.  I do.  Ted's funeral home.  Yes.  Emporium.  Yeah, of course.  Why would I say funeral home?  Of course.  We have the discount package where we'll put three strangers in the same coffin.  It's very unpopular.  Why is it unpopular?  It doesn't matter in the end.  Because everybody, nobody wants to grieve together. 
[01:31:30]  Just three strange bodies on top of each other.  Looks uncomfortable.  Ted, what do you call your funeral home?  Ted's funeral home, Emporium and Final Resting Place Incorporated.  Ted, who gets the top so that they can see them?  We mix it up a little bit.  If you come to the early viewing, perhaps you're a loved one.  At the later viewing, perhaps they're a loved one.  We try not to mix the races because then it's just too obvious from across the room. 
[01:32:00]  That actually made sense, though.  Yes, it did.  Where you would rotate the deceased.  Sure we would.  Yeah.  Can't you put your relatives in the woods like you do with your family pets?  Yeah, just bury them.  I know my dad would just throw our beloved pet in the woods somewhere to be found by somebody.  Ripped apart by animals in the night.  Even though it's Long Island.  Yeah.  I'm sure the raccoons would do a good job on a family pet.  Oh, hell yeah.  If you left it in the woods. 
[01:32:30]  They love ripping apart your family pet.  Look, man, my dad, he needed to save a few bucks and we lost dogs.  And a lot of them because we lived on a main, you know, 25A.  It's a very busy road when I was growing up.  Still is a very busy road.  We lost a lot of pets and dad would all of a sudden take that pet and go somewhere.  And I know he wasn't spending his money on a vet.  No.  Unfortunately, he's now gone because I could handle where he dumped these pets now that I'm older.  However, how great would it be if your dad showed you the family pet graveyard? 
[01:33:00]  Here it is.  Just a bunch of bones.  Right.  Little kitten skulls.  Technically, I think my dad was a serial killer.  Technically, because he didn't kill the dogs, but he did some ghoulish things with their corpses.  Poses them in seductive poses like a serial killer.  He would do things with the skin.  Buffalo Bill.  Did you have a dad that would, like, you know, all of a sudden take the dead pet and dispose of it?  No. 
[01:33:30]  Ours would die or run away and we'd never find them.  That's what they tell you.  Yeah.  But Smokey, I still found on the side of the road.  Remember Smokey?  Sure.  With the maggots eating half of Smokey's head.  Very, very creepy.  But I think if you have an outdoor animal, you're just asking for sorrow.  You know, it's one of those things where it's like, oh, God, it's going to get run over.  Something.  It's just going to get run over.  Yeah, we don't live.  None of us. 
[01:34:00]  None of us.  I mean, we're a national shark.  But most of us don't have farms where you get a pet and you open up the back door and it's gone for days and it's safe.  It's running in the cornfield and chasing cows.  A quarter acre with cars all around.  With cars just speeding in front of it.  And then you just let your dog out.  Or your kitty.  Very good point coming in from Denver Pest.  No.  Pest out west, baby.  Oh, why didn't they make funeral plots the height way instead of length?  Cemeteries would have so much more room.  Because it's probably perceived that your loved ones would be very tired standing in. 
[01:34:30]  Standing for eternity.  So someone figured out, you know, it just looks better if they're laying down for eternity.  That is true.  And they wouldn't stand.  They'd just kind of collapse and crumble.  Right.  Like a frumpy make.  Picture yourself collapsed in a standing closet forever.  You would.  Your skeleton would just face your skull on top of a pile of bones.  All right.  But in the end, what does it matter?  Please.  I'm with you.  It's all this perception shit. 
[01:35:00]  Yeah.  Don't you want your loved one laying nice on a nice little pillow and looking good in a really nice coffin?  No.  Burn them.  I saw what they did.  They just dumped those freaking workers.  Usually they're illegals.  Oh, by the time you reach your car, they're already cranking that lever down.  Yeah.  I shouldn't say usually, but one of the funerals I went to, they were illegals.  Yeah.  And they wanted to get this shit over with as we're all grieving.  Yeah.  I peeked out the back door of the service area, and they're there waiting with their shovels. 
[01:35:30]  Ghouls.  Can we be done with this so we could, you know, to them it was just another, you know, hour of work.  Those gruesome ghouls.  They didn't care.  And I know they just threw that coffin in sideways.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, God.  What do you think they do?  You think some of them just.  Dude, what do you think they do?  You think they get in the hole and like place it down nice?  Gingerly.  Hell no.  You think sometimes it just busts open and they laugh?  By the time you're in your car going to a restaurant because you have to have the meal with everybody. 
[01:36:00]  Ugh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They're just throwing that coffin in any way they could get it in and get it buried immediately.  Oh.  So they can move on to the next dead body.  Just cracks open.  Grandma comes spilling out.  They laugh as they just shovel dirt on her head.  Yeah.  You got to think.  Because they don't even fix it.  Why would you?  Why?  You got to think.  Just leave her crooked up against the coffin for eternity.  All uncomfortable.  Yeah.  I have to think.  All right.  Let's.  You can eat the bodies.  That's good news. 
[01:36:30]  Jesus.  Mike, Georgia.  You know Jimmy Norton's going to be in the Atlanta area, right?  Yeah.  I say you can go like the Soylent Green movie and eat your relatives, right?  Oh.  I thought you were.  I thought there was some kind of twisted law in the books.  Where you can eat your relatives?  That would be interesting.  That's a sick tombstone.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Let me go to Footer.  Footer.  Yo.  What's up, boys?  Hey, buddy.  Hey, we were going to Southern State Parkway, and a few of my buddies were getting on Southern 
[01:37:00]  State, and there's a little bit of traffic, so traffic was merging on, and there was an  old lady that had a little white fluffy dog hanging out the passenger side window, and  he must have wanted to jump out onto the little grassy area.  So she panics, so me and my buddy jump out of the car to kind of like help scoop up the  dog.  The dog panics and jumps out into the middle of Southern State, and boom, gets fucking  hit.  A little white dog everywhere, bro.  We just felt so fucking bad.  It was ridiculous.  What did the lady do?  Oh, bro.  I was hysterically crying. 
[01:37:30]  People were pulling over.  It was a fucking, it was like a massacre.  It was like a hot beach day.  Everybody going to the beach on the Southern State.  And it was kind of your fault, right?  Oh, 100% our fault.  We tried to do the right thing, and we killed the old lady's dog.  Wait, the dog was what, buddy?  He was trying to jump out of the car, and you guys tried to stop it?  No, no, no.  What happened was, he was hanging out, like his little paws were hanging out, and I  guess when she was merging, he wanted to go into a little grassy area and maybe take  a peep.  So he jumped out.  We were like, oh shit, that dog just jumped out.  Let's go try to like, you know, like rustle him up for her. 
[01:38:00]  And he must have fucking panicked, and he shot across.  And the only really train, the lane that was moving was the left lane.  And he shot across, and fucking boom, he got nailed white.  It was like one of those like Bichons or whatever they are.  A Bichon Frise.  Ooh, fancy man, yes.  And like fur everywhere was horrible.  Horrible.  Man.  Now, I got a question for you, Footer.  It sounds horrific.  Same scenario, but it's a possum.  Okay. 
[01:38:30]  No one's grieving.  Exactly.  No one gives a shit.  No, no, nothing.  All right, guys.  Hey, take care.  You rock your fat slump.  Yeah.  And how many of us, you're driving with your girl, and she sees a dead animal on the side  of the road, and she's like, oh my God.  She gets wet, right?  Oh, just mine.  And then you go, oh, it's a possum.  And then everything's cool.  But if you go, whoa, that was a dog, then, you know, there's tears and stuff.  But if you say, it's a possum, it's a raccoon.  Yeah.  What are some of those dumb other animals? 
[01:39:00]  Skunk.  Squirt.  Skunk.  Monk.  Mongoose.  Bald eagle.  But there's a sense of relief.  Leopard.  Sense of relief when you realize it's not a dog or a cat, right?  Baby elephant.  Baby elephant.  Crocodile.  I think you see by the side of the road, pterodactyl.  Am I right, though?  I think you're right on that one.  Amandillo.  But in God's eyes, aren't they all important?  They should be. 
[01:39:30]  But not in humans' eyes.  They're not.  Unless they're adorably cute.  They're fucked.  Let's say how to Frank in Texas.  Frank.  Frank in Texas.  Yeah.  What's up?  I was just letting y'all know, yeah, it's illegal to just go burying yourself.  Is it?  Yeah.  So you can't bury a body on your own?  No, sir.  Health codes say you cannot bury a body on your own. 
[01:40:00]  All right.  So why are they holding us hostage and making us pay these crazy, you know, fees and rates  or whatever you want to call them to bury your loved ones?  Well, there's stuff you can do.  You don't have to embalm a body.  I mean, so that's a lot of the fees.  Oh, so if you're okay with them rotting.  Bro, it's pretty safe to say the average funeral or whatever is, I think someone said  it, about $7,000.  Yeah.  That's a lot of money for a lot of people.  That could put them into a financial situation they can't afford. 
[01:40:30]  In ye olde poorhouse.  So what does our country, what does our government do to make sure that people aren't going broke  because they have to do the right thing and bury their loved one?  Well, that's ridiculous.  They don't do anything.  But to bury, the burial is only $500.  You can put them in a box.  Can you bring your own box?  Oh.  Yeah.  Bring your own box.  Like you can get a Best Buy box, maybe shove grandma into the box your TV came in? 
[01:41:00]  You know, I'm not real sure about that.  I'm horrific with that, babe.  All right.  We got grandma ready for the funeral.  You throw her in a Best Buy TV box.  The old flat screen box.  You just throw her in the back of the pickup truck and just show up.  We're here.  We're here.  We're here.  Let's get this over with.  Yeah, I think it's easy, fellas.  All right.  Yeah.  Why couldn't you do that?  Just use a refrigerator box.  You show up at the cemetery.  Mm-hmm.  And you're just like, yeah, I just want to plant this bitch.  Oh, yeah.  And you think, yeah.  Well, let's go to Randy in pit. 
[01:41:30]  Randy?  Yeah.  You're tuning son of a bitch.  You're tuning son of a bitch.  What's up, Randy?  I was a kid by about 11 or 12 years old there, come out from the amusement park, and my dog  had got loose and got hit by a car.  And my dad takes it, buries it.  About two weeks later, he told me where he buried it, and I'm riding my dirt bike back  there.  And I decided to go see my dog. 
[01:42:00]  And there was a hole in the ground with this rib cage just laying there, some fox or something  that dug it up and ate my dog.  Oh.  And dad tries to do the right thing, but, I mean, come on.  Nice.  You think your dad's going to dig a...  Fucking serial killer with his shallow grave.  Yeah, he's nice.  Exactly.  Thanks a lot.  Proving my point, that sort of serial killer-ish.  Yeah.  Yeah, they're not digging a really deep hole so the wild animals out there don't get to  your pet.  No, don't get to your pet.  That's it.  They dig them up and rip them apart.  Tear them to pieces.  That's right. 
[01:42:30]  All right, boys.  Bludgeon out.  Thank you, sir.  Let's go to Dan in New York.  Dan.  Dan.  Hey, how you doing?  Hey.  Hi.  Hey, I'm good.  Nice story here.  New Year's Eve, 1998.  My mom died.  So there we are, New Year's Day.  We're sitting there in a funeral home.  Pretty selfish on her part, huh?  Well, whatever, you know.  Anyway, we're sitting there.  Kind of like those people that get married Fourth of July weekend and stuff.  Yeah, come on.  Jeez, thanks.  Good stuff to do.  No, really.  I didn't want to go to a beach and do something fun.  Barbecue and watch fireworks. 
[01:43:00]  It's way more important to watch you get married and divorced in five years.  Thanks.  Sorry.  I also did a Christmas Eve wedding, I think.  Ew.  Or right around Christmas.  I'm like, what are you thinking?  We all have to go shopping.  It's already a hassle this time of year.  And now you're throwing a wedding into the mix?  Yeah, thanks.  What the fuck?  Go ahead, Dan.  So anyway, we're sitting there picking out the coffins and this and that and everything.  We're saying, well, we want this one, that one.  And they said, well, this one here has a 10-year guarantee. 
[01:43:30]  And it's like, what's a 10-year guarantee?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's like, okay, what's the warranty?  Yeah.  What are you guaranteed against?  Well, any kind of leakage or anything.  Well, we've got to put it in a vault.  You know, you've got us $3,000 for a concrete vault that they have to put in New York.  You don't even understand the biggest thing is how the fuck are you going to know whether the guarantee, whether it is leaking or whether, you know, something happened to it.  Right. 
[01:44:00]  Just last year, it was the 10-year, and I kind of brought that up to my sister.  I said, you know what?  I said, I wonder if we should dig mom up and see if, you know, we can get our money back if it leaked or not.  That's not a bad idea.  You're out there just loosely digging up your 10 mom.  She's all mildewed.  I imagine it costs money to exhume a body, though, so it wouldn't even be worth it.  Oh, literal Jim.  Oh, Jim.  The wrecker of all fun.  I want a coffin that lasts 45 minutes and then disintegrates.  Yeah, why not?  Yeah. 
[01:44:30]  You've got to, like, have the funeral real fast or else people are going to be horrified.  I want a coffin made of lead.  Solid, heavy lead.  So it's just a hassle for everybody.  Yeah, very inconvenient.  As they move your body around.  Or a coffin made of paraffin.  I want it to be something that just bothers everyone.  He wants diamonds on his pillows.  What?  All right.  What else there, Dan?  That's about it.  Well, I got lucky with my dad.  Lucky he was in the military, and we had him buried in a military cemetery, and they took care of all the costs that way, you know? 
[01:45:00]  I mean, he was in World War II, you know?  Yeah.  So, I mean.  Yeah, they do a good job.  Absolutely.  Yeah, it was a nice ceremony.  They make it a lot easier for the family when you've got someone in the military that unfortunately passes.  Right.  So, all right.  That's all.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Later.  Yep.  Well, we got a guy in the industry.  Let's skip to the bottom of this. 
[01:45:30]  Paul.  What?  What's up, guys?  How you doing?  I'm just laughing at myself for a second.  It's like I've never had a job in my life where I could just sit here and watch a girl getting ass fucked while I'm on my job.  Who's it?  I don't know.  I just popped up a link, and now there's a cum shot, and a chick is 69ing with her and licking up the byproduct.  Can I imagine how great their job is?  Yes.  The guy's fucking her?  You think you're having fun?  He's actually at work when he's doing that. 
[01:46:00]  You know, you make a good point.  That's his job.  Just watching Smut and listening to phone calls.  What the fuck?  Paul, Jersey.  What's going on?  What's up, guys?  How you doing?  Hey.  All right, Joe.  There's a couple of things that you guys heard or said that were incorrect.  Yeah.  So, the reason they don't stand them up, it doesn't make a difference, because of the sizing.  They let them down, and they dig them deeper.  So, you end up in the same square footage, you get the same amount of...  Oh, well, when you think about it, he's right.  The same square footage is being buried. 
[01:46:30]  That's right.  Yeah, but the thing is, you could put them closer together if they weren't long like that.  That's true.  Yeah.  You could put them next to each other, like safe deposit boxes.  You'd bump into some stranger, like grieving and talking to a headstone.  You really can't do that either, because the last caller said that you have to buy the vault.  That's where you want to spend.  If you're going to spend money, spend money in the vault.  Because just like, like Opie was mentioning, yeah, this coffin, after you wheel them in and out of church and lay them out for a couple of days, it never sees the light of day again. 
[01:47:00]  But who gives a crap about the vault?  Yeah.  Who cares?  The vault is really what keeps you together and what makes sure that she doesn't get inside, if you even care about that.  Why would you care?  Because a vault, a mausoleum's like inside, right?  No, no, no.  The vault is literally, when they dig a hole, they lower a concrete, basically it looks like a giant coffin.  Then they put the coffin inside of that, and then they feel it with vaults. 
[01:47:30]  Who came up with this?  The actual concrete is what keeps everything and keeps the ground, because what was happening was in the old caskets and in the old cemeteries, you'd see a lot of drop-offs, right?  Like where people were dug, because when that wood would rot, it would just basically, the ground would fall in, and you'd have a whole bunch that looked like potholes in front of the gravestone.  Oh, God, that's what you want.  Meaning all the dirt, you know, collapsed onto grandma.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  And splinters.  And splinters. 
[01:48:00]  Oh.  How about cremation?  I have to be cremated.  I cannot be buried in the ground.  No?  I cannot.  Are you scared?  It's just awful.  You'd be frightened?  It's awful.  It just doesn't matter.  I don't care.  I don't want to.  Hey, the other caller said that you don't have to get embalmed.  That's 100% incorrect.  Everybody has to be embalmed if they're going to be viewed.  Right.  If not, that you don't have to embalm them, and you can just fire them up.  Outside of that, yes, if you're going to be buried, you have to be embalmed. 
[01:48:30]  But you can even check out on the itemization.  It's like a few hundred bucks to be embalmed.  Oh, the itemization of, it was unbelievable.  They're running down like you're getting extras for your car.  Do you want this?  Do you want that?  Air conditioning.  Yeah, basically.  It was unbelievable, the choices.  It doesn't matter.  Do you remember what the biggest line item is?  Outside of the coffin.  Do you remember what the biggest thing is?  Wow.  Not, no.  It's almost five years, actually.  Coming up soon. 
[01:49:00]  Dude, makeup.  The makeup artists are who makes out.  Makeup.  For a dead person.  Hey, but here's the deal.  What if you can't afford, you know, all these costs?  Well, dude, we're not doctors, so we don't have to provide service if you can't pay.  No, no, no.  Paul.  Paul.  Paul, I understand.  Hey, go fuck yourself.  Yeah.  Paul, I understand you've got a business, and that's fine.  I'm not going after you.  That's fine.  I mean, you're going to get plenty of people that are going to get your service.  But I'm saying, what are the options for people that just can't afford it? 
[01:49:30]  Do you know?  Potter's Field.  Pretty much, yeah.  There are some low-income housing-type cemeteries that you can go, and it's basically a pine  box and a piece of shit that's going to fall apart.  But, yeah, that's really what your option is.  That's great.  Here.  Here's a piece of shit that's going to fall apart.  And that's how they present it to you.  Or this piece of shit.  Now, what's real interesting, if you want to hear about more of your tax dollars being 
[01:50:00]  pissed away for special interests, in this state, in the state of New Jersey, there  are also special, basically, potter's fields for people like Muslim people, and they're  state-owned.  And you just kind of go in there, and you file, and you can get a pot, and it's basically  for free.  But, you know, if you're the white Catholic guy, you can't get that treatment.  Hmm.  Right. 
[01:50:30]  Interesting.  No surprise.  Yeah.  All right, Paul.  Thank you so much.  Bye, guys.  There you go, Paul.  Thank you so much.  You're cool.  Stealing in death.  You fucking creep.  Buried three bodies.  There are ways to save money.  Steve, what's up?  Hey, yo.  Yes.  Yeah.  That guy's, a couple of those guys are partly right.  I mean, it just depends on what the state is.  And it's kind of funny you mention the grandma, because we just buried our grandpa like that. 
[01:51:00]  I went down there.  He had no money.  Went down there, picked him up in the back of my truck.  We made the pine box.  Went out there.  Had to dig the hole.  Buried him.  Wow.  The funeral service guy had to come out there and make sure the hole was buried.  It was, you know, the correct death and everything, but it was like 200 bucks.  Buried my grandpa like that, an aunt and an uncle.  So it just depends on the state.  Dig the hole yourself.  You dig the hole yourself where?  In a graveyard?  Yes, sir.  That would be cool.  Get the whole family involved. 
[01:51:30]  It's the way we did it.  Me and my two brothers.  My dad went out there and took shifts until we had to bury our uncle, and then we went and got a backhoe.  I had to dig a grave with my brother, and I still say the worst day of my life ever.  Ever.  What?  For like a...  Ever.  For what?  But it just depends on the state.  I mean, you know, my grandma didn't have no money, so she just asked if we'd do it.  We built the box, went and took it up there, put him in it, drove him home, put him in the hole, and covered him up. 
[01:52:00]  Wow.  Because, you know, you're dead.  You don't know nothing.  Did you use dovetail joints?  I'm kind of with you on that.  You don't know nothing.  I like other things.  Or tongue and groove.  I like that other dumb stuff where you, I don't know, get a fucking park bench or something with a good view with their name on that.  Way more.  Yeah, it was kind of, yeah.  Well, the deal is on the state laws, though, on the embalming, you know, none of them want to be viewed or anything like that. 
[01:52:30]  You know, it's kind of a, the state of Arkansas, it's a 24-hour period.  You have to have them in the ground inside of 24 hours.  Yeah.  So, you know, it's a religious thing.  Are they arrested?  Right.  We didn't go for all that crap, so, and, you know, kind of all feel the same way.  So, it was pretty cut and dry.  All right.  Thank you, Steve.  No, really.  We learned a little something there.  And you know how, thanks, Steve.  You know, one of the themes of our show is that we're not really free in this country. 
[01:53:00]  Yeah.  We make, we like to make believe we are, and we like to make believe we're freer than other countries out there.  I definitely question that.  I don't know for sure.  But try, like, burying a relative in the backyard of your house.  Yeah.  And then you'll see how free you really are.  When they find it.  But when this country first started, that's pretty much what they did, right?  Yeah, you went up to.  You owned your house.  Someone died.  You're like, all right, well, now we figure out what part of the backyard is going to be the ghoulish graveyard for our family.  For the whole family, yeah.  But try that now.  Yeah.  You live in Patchogue or Levittown. 
[01:53:30]  Why don't you try to do that?  And then you'll see how free you really are in this country.  We've got to wait six months to get a zoning thing for a fence.  Right.  You're going to start burying loved ones in your yard.  Could you imagine?  Good luck to you.  And be clueless.  Like, what?  I own my house.  Yeah.  And I'm going to bury my loved one in the backyard.  In the front yard.  In the front yard, right.  Try to get that done.  That's pretty ghoulish.  It goes with our theme.  It would never work, yeah.  No.  I told this story with my brother. 
[01:54:00]  It's horrific.  Yeah.  It's just awful.  We were actually at the wake for my uncle who dropped dead of a heart attack.  And he was like 50 tops, I think.  It was horrible.  And then we get the call after just a horrendous day.  My dad calls me to say Brett's dog got run over because we lived on the busy road, right?  Yeah.  And my dad was in horrible health.  He had one artery, basically.  How did you guys have pets?  I don't know.  I don't know. 
[01:54:30]  It's just a lifetime of sorrow.  I would have to ask my – if one of my brothers are listening, maybe they could send me an email.  I know of – my cat was run over.  Brett's dog was run over.  I know of five family pets that that's how they died.  For real, I think.  At least four.  That's too much grief.  At least four.  Maybe five.  Yeah.  So I get the call that Brett's dog got hit by a car. 
[01:55:00]  And it's dead.  And my dad basically said, get over here.  Brett's not doing well.  This is the owner of FH Riley's.  This is horrific.  My dad – it was a Rottweiler.  Yeah.  And those things are heavy.  Kind of beefy.  My dad has like one artery still pumping to his heart.  So – or out of his heart, whatever.  I mean, he's in bad shape.  But he decided – he knew how important this dog was to Brett.  So he lifted the thing out of the road and carried it, which could basically risk it in his own life because that could have easily been the last straw with his heart. 
[01:55:30]  But he puts it in a wheelbarrow.  And then I show up at the house and Brett is – you can't even talk to him.  Inconsolable.  Exactly.  He's on his knees.  He's losing his mind.  And then about an hour goes by and he looks at me and he goes, I have to bury him now.  And I'm like – I felt like I was in a Stephen King movie.  Oh.  I felt like I was in a Stephen King movie.  It was like February.  It was like single digits. 
[01:56:00]  There was a full moon.  The ground was frozen.  Just put him out there.  There was snow on the ground.  He'll keep until it gets warm.  And then he's picking at the hard earth, trying to get some traction to dig this hole.  Crying.  The whole time crying and literally collapsing.  That's creepy.  Was he sad?  Worst day of my life.  Worst day of my life.  I've been through some bad days, but this was horrific to go through.  A Rottweiler. 
[01:56:30]  That sounds pretty bad.  But he's one of those guys who has to do the right thing and he just knew he had to do that at that moment.  Right then and there.  And we – I held the flashlight as he's digging because the moonlight wasn't good enough.  Not quite good enough.  Just enough to make it eerie.  Yes, that's exactly what I'm getting at.  I'm not going to make it eerie, but not enough light.  And we're not talking because what are you going to talk about?  Yeah.  Hey, so.  How about the Yankees?  He got that hole dug though, man. 
[01:57:00]  He's a real man.  It was for winter.  Why would the Yankees be playing?  I don't know.  Sorry.  He jumped in the hole to make sure it was deep enough and it was like above his nipples.  And then we placed the dog in the hole.  Tossed him in.  In a tarp or no?  I forgot how he did it.  I think –  You should have been a dick and just kicked it in harshly.  Jesus, Jimmy.  Why not?  Just to be like the tough brother?  Tough love, yeah.  Yeah.  Get over it.  He had a kick in there.  It was his dog.  It's terrible.  He had it from literally when – you know, those Rottweilers, when they're born, they're 
[01:57:30]  like as big as your fist tops.  They're tiny little things.  Little pup.  And yeah.  All right.  Nice segment there.  Right.  Digging a grave under the moonlight.  Should have had the same vibe when they were digging Billy Bats up in Goodfellas.  How about a wing?  You want a paw?  All right.  You look more like a hot lungs kind of guy.  A wing. 
[01:58:00]  A wing.  My grandma used to take dead kittens and throw them in the river.  Would Hellman's pay for Erock's funeral?  That's footer.  Aunt wanted – aunt meaning, you know, your aunt.  Yeah.  Wanted her ashes at sea.  Got the ashes all over our old family.  I love these stories.  Yeah.  A lot of times the wind doesn't cooperate.  John in Brooklyn.  What's up, John?  What's up, boys?  What's going on?  Hey.  So, listen.  We're all on the boat.  My mother's sister, all she did our whole life, she wants to be on a boat. 
[01:58:30]  So, we get on this thing.  You got the priest, her family.  By the way, I'm going to get my ass kicked for telling this story because they still cry about it.  Yeah.  So, we're all on the boat.  So, we're all on the boat.  They pray.  The priest makes the prayer.  They open the urn.  They throw the ashes out.  And there's my aunt floating in a Ziploc bag in the ocean.  And so, they grab the hook to pull her in.  Everyone's freaking crying. 
[01:59:00]  I'm hysterical laughing in the corner with my wife.  You know, you got to laugh at that.  I'm sorry.  But that's just unbelievable.  Go ahead, John.  Sorry.  It was hysterical.  So, then, I mean, they open up the Ziploc bag.  They go to toss it.  The wind just blows.  And everybody's covered with my aunt's ashes all over the boat.  Like, you all just ran out of a house on fire.  And then you got to, like, brush her off at you.  All awkwardly and sad.  I'm going to miss her.  In your eyes.  You can't see.  People were freaking out. 
[01:59:30]  It was the funniest thing I've ever seen.  Did everyone jump in the water to get the ashes off them?  No.  Everyone just tried to let...  Everyone was just shaking themselves off.  My mother's hysterical crying.  The people laughing and people crying at the same time.  Yeah.  Wow.  Well, it lightens up the...  The mood a little bit, right?  Does it?  I think so.  I think so.  All right, boys.  Punching out.  Good story, John.  Thank you.  Been to a...  You want this one?  This one's for Jimmy.  Mike in Florida.  Talk to Jimmy.  Jimmy. 
[02:00:00]  Mike.  Happy birthday, buddy.  Thank you.  Listen, I used to work at a cremation company up in Farmingdale for all the New York people.  Trust me.  You don't want to get cremated.  It's a disgusting, filthy...  Just like you're laying on your back.  If you open the retort dish, the thing that you can see the body getting burned, you can  see flames shooting out of your eyeballs.  Ah!  Do you really want that?  How long does it take to burn the body?  Honestly, you're going to be in there for a good 20 minutes, and then they have to open 
[02:00:30]  it up to base you and go in with a poker to get your torso to collapse, and then they  fire it back up again.  Wow.  And we're completely sure...  Let me just throw this on the table.  And we're completely sure you don't feel anything after you die, right?  We have to figure that one out for sure.  I don't know.  I don't care what you believe in as far as God and medicine and all that.  What about the unknown?  We're convinced that you don't feel shit, right?  I just need to know.  After I saw some of those flames. 
[02:01:00]  I've got to be honest, man.  It's still...  As much as that would suck, it beats 35 years from now still rotting and still being conscious  if you want.  Jimmy, can I make a suggestion?  You want to be entombed.  Put yourself in a nice wall, and then if something happens, maybe they cure cancer or something,  and they pop you right out of the wall.  Yeah.  Your bones at that point.  Your bones, dude.  I don't want to be something...  I'm mummified.  You want to be a mummy?  What? 
[02:01:30]  You want to be a mummy?  Probably if I can walk around with the wraps on and frighten people.  I want to be a mummy, but I want to terrorize people.  Yeah.  Thank you.  A horrible, scary mummy.  Before we wrap up, what about the people that now stuff their pets?  That's a big thing.  Yeah.  They freeze-dry them now.  Yeah.  And then just have them like they're just sleeping.  Around the house.  Like they're sleeping in the corner.  Yeah, yeah.  They freeze-dry them.  Yeah.  And they don't rot.  They're not really stuffed.  They can probably find a website.  And then they pose them.  They pose them like, let's say you pose your dog. 
[02:02:00]  With my fucking throat.  You know what did that?  That God fucking envelope that I opened up.  Yeah.  You know those manila envelopes with the dust inside?  Yeah.  You can't open those without ripping open the dust thing.  It got all down my throat.  Been hacking like crazy all morning.  I got something that might help you.  I forgot where I was.  You were talking about posing people to those pets.  Yes, yes.  And then they pose them like they're laying down in a little bed. 
[02:02:30]  Yeah, like they're napping.  Like they're napping or something.  Or they're playing.  Playing would be even creepier.  It's like sleeping.  Look.  It's a sleeping dead cat.  Perpetual pet.  Get the fuck out of here.  The perfect plan for the perfect pet.  And you freeze-dry it.  Look, it looks like it's just sleeping.  Just let it go.  And then people pet it.  But it's like.  Get out of here.  Let it go.  How about just a picture if you really need to?  Yeah.  Let it go.  I wanted to do that with Chester. 
[02:03:00]  Fuck Chester.  Look at that thing.  That was dead.  I'm still not over at Chester.  Dude, that dog is dead?  We'll meet again.  Little Peaches?  Huh?  That dog's dead?  Yeah.  How the fuck are you going to live in your house with that scary thing just peering at you?  And you know it comes alive when you're sleeping.  Oh my God.  Everyone knows that.  You shut your eyes and then you open it and it's a little closer to you?  Mm-hmm.  Like, oh shit.  And at first you think you're just seeing things.  Oh no.  And you try to talk yourself into the fact that you're just seeing things and then, no, it's real.  What are you going to do with Dexter?  Ew, your cleavage sucks. 
[02:03:30]  I'm sorry.  Dexter's not going to die.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  Okay.  It's fine.  You see that to me?  But that's way too creepy.  Yeah.  I never do that.  All right.  Are we done with this?  Buried a cat which came back to life.  Dug my dog's grave while my dog was walking around alive.  What the fuck?  That's a pessimist.  I'm trying to move on, but let's say hi to Tim.  Tim.  Hey, what's going on, fellas?  Hey.  Yeah, my dog had to put him down.  Oh, no.  We were going to put him down.  Huh?  We were going to put him down. 
[02:04:00]  He had cancer.  So I scheduled an appointment and I dug the hole before the kids got home from school.  And he was walking around and, you know, enjoying it.  Dig a hole?  It could be the first hole I dug.  Yeah, you should have made him do it with his little paws.  So you dig the hole and then when did the dog die?  Well, we made the appointment like three in the afternoon.  So I dug it in the morning and took him down, had him put to sleep, brought him home and buried him.  Jesus.  God bless you.  Yeah, it was tough, man.  Yeah. 
[02:04:30]  The kids actually ended up helping out.  My son was a tough guy.  Yeah.  Tough guy.  Tough guy.  Rob of Long Island writes, didn't cry at my grandma's death, but when my pet died, I cried like a little girl.  I cried at both.  Yeah, it was tough.  I balanced it.  I cried at people and animals.  You treated your grandma like a pet?  People I don't care about.  I did, actually.  We buried her in the yard.  They're saying that you could bury people legally in Vermont in the backyard.  Let's go to John in Vermont.  It's all woods.  Well, Vermont's one of those.  Hey, man.  How you doing?  Hey, John.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Thank you, John. 
[02:05:00]  God bless.  Yeah, in the state of Vermont, if you follow all the statues for burying a body, you can start  your own ghoulish graveyard right there next to your house.  For real?  Yeah, I swear to God.  But what if you sell your house?  They have to deal with it.  They have to pay to move it if they want it moved.  Wow.  Then you put your pool over it.  There you go.  And what happens is, you fall in.  All right, guys.  Punch it out.  Poltergeist.  Yeah. 
[02:05:30]  See, I'm in today.  Here's one last question.  Have you ever had to finish off a pet that got hit by a car or something?  Oh, damn.  That is ghoul shit.  Or deer.  You've got to be kidding me.  There's people out there, man.  You hit an animal and it's suffering.  You have to do the right thing.  And now you're just turning into a fucking murderer on the side of the road.  And you're just on the way to Little League or something.  Oh, man.  When I woke up today, I didn't realize I was going to be a murderer. 
[02:06:00]  That's bad.  Let me say hi to Jeff in New York.  Jeff.  Yeah.  When I was a kid, my neighbor's dog got hit in front of the house.  And that's what my old man did.  He went out with a claw hammer and finished the dog off because it was suffering.  A claw hammer.  Holy shit.  Wow.  You can't even do it with a gun.  Why didn't he just pull his little dog fingernails out?  We didn't have a gun at the house.  So he had to, you know, use the hammer on it.  What the fuck you doing with that hammer?  How ghoulish would it be to see your dad with a claw hammer walking out to the curb? 
[02:06:30]  Just kind of woke up with it.  He should have just backed the car over its little head.  Jesus.  It's quick.  Is that horrific, though?  That is bad.  You got to just pound his head in with a hammer.  And the dog's probably like, what is he doing?  Yeah.  Well, help me.  Do you think he wants a piece of cheese?  It's Skeeter in Wyoming.  Skeeter.  Hey, Skeeter.  Well, what's going on, guys?  Three years ago, in the middle of January, it's 20 below. 
[02:07:00]  We got two foot of snow on the ground.  And my mom calls me from work and tells me I have to put my dog down of 16 years.  I thought he was just giving us a weather report from the past.  Just go up, dig the grave, come back down, take my dog up, throw her in the bed of the truck,  take her up on the hill, and I have to shoot my own dog.  Jesus.  That was tough. 
[02:07:30]  Where did you live?  Of mice and men?  Old Geller.  Not just tons of it is, I guess.  Then my grandma died last week, and just like the other guy, I cried more for my dog than my grandma.  Yeah, I think that's pretty common.  Did she go down the same way as the dog?  Yeah.  Someone just...  I'd like to.  Kevin has, in Brooklyn, just writes, with a claw hammer.  I know.  The claw hammer is fucking brutal.  Later, boy.  Thank you, sir.  What end of the claw hammer do you use?  Do you use the claw? 
[02:08:00]  The claw.  You have to.  Or do you use the hammer part?  No, the blunt end.  Blunt trauma or an actual gaping wound to the skull?  No, because the claw might get stuck in the dog's head as it's yelping.  Oh, my God.  Fucking horrendous.  Oh, that is so fucking...  I don't even want to think about it.  All right.  It's terrible.  We're trying to move on, but Jeremy, there's some good stories here still.  Jeremy, Indiana.  Jeremy.  Hey, guys.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Thank you.  Hey, when my dad...  Actually, our family pet died. 
[02:08:30]  My dad had him cremated, and he sits in a little ceramic doghouse on the mantle.  What?  Wow.  How big is your mantle?  It's a retriever, you said?  Yeah, a golden retriever.  Yeah.  Well, they get pretty small once they're ashes.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, you said...  I'm sorry.  I thought...  They just threw the dog up there?  No, I thought it was like the frozen pets.  A stuffed or something.  Yeah, I'm sorry.  No, no, no, no.  They cremated them.  I tapped out for a second.  They cremated them.  Okay.  He had cancer, and they had gas.  All right, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, that's pretty common.  I thought you had the retriever just hanging out on the mantle like that. 
[02:09:00]  No, no, no.  That's freaky.  All right.  You want to move on in, or you want...  I mean...  Yeah, I mean...  Buried a cat, came back to life.  A friend of mine shot a rot with a .22 pistol and didn't kill it.  It ran off into the woods.  Holy shit.  I don't know why I'm laughing.  That's terrible.  Let me say hi to Neil in PA.  The dog must be going, what the fuck did I do to you?  What are you doing to me?  Neil.  How are you doing, boys?  Happy birthday, Jim.  We love you.  Thank you. 
[02:09:30]  Hey, man.  About 15 years ago, a buddy of mine had two Rottweilers.  This big, aggressive dog, the male started to go after him when he'd come home from work.  I mean, literally attack him.  I was over there one day, and he said, I got to get rid of this dog.  He's like, so we took it out in the woods, and he's carrying a .22 pistol, and I'm thinking,  that might not be enough.  He shot this fucking thing right in the head.  It didn't die.  It jumped up, bled all over him, scared the hell out of both of us, took off into the woods. 
[02:10:00]  We're standing there.  He's covered in blood.  We just in the house, get shotguns.  It took us four hours to track this thing down and finish it off.  It was horrible.  Now you're fucking...  It seemed fine.  Now you're a hunter.  The dog takes a bullet and runs off.  Maybe it wasn't quite ready.  Yeah, it is what it is.  Wow.  That's how you sleep.  All right, thank you, sir.  All right, and finally this, and then I think we can finally go to break.  John in, how do you say it?  It's not Boston anymore, Bawfiston? 
[02:10:30]  Bawfiston.  Bawfiston.  Bawfiston.  Bawfiston.  Hey, John.  Just listening to you on BCN.  Thanks, John, for reminding us.  Thank you, John.  Yeah, that decision worked out in their favor, huh?  Getting rid of us?  That was smart.  Yeah, I know.  That decision really turned things around, huh?  I know.  It sucks, but what can you do?  But they continue keeping their jobs.  Wonderful.  Go ahead, John.  Anyways, so, yeah, one of our supervisors at work, we're talking, he had, his brother  died long, you know, in the 50s or so, and he had, you know, some type of cancer or whatever. 
[02:11:00]  The young kid, and just two years ago, they were, they had to move the body.  They were doing some type of family thing or whatever, you know, graveyard, whatever they  were doing.  They had to move the body.  So his parents had to go and look at the, at the body after they exhumed it to make  sure that, you know, it's the right guy and I'm moving some other guy.  How are you going to identify it?  Exactly.  And they popped open that casket, and this kid's been buried for, you know, 50 plus years. 
[02:11:30]  And the casket opens, and they're looking at him, and he looked exactly the same the  day he was buried.  So, I don't know what they're doing nowadays, but even 50 years ago, they're making you last  a long, long time.  It all depends on how dry the ground is, you know, there's all these factors.  Whether the guy was dead, would they put him in?  Because if he lived for a couple years after, that's probably like, wouldn't you like to  know that they're kind of, let's just call it moving on? 
[02:12:00]  Yeah.  Instead of frozen in time.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  I don't, ugh.  Ghoulish and creepy.  Like, looking exactly the same, that is creepy.  Well, speaking of moving on, I'll see you guys later.  I like this, John.  Thanks, John.  All right, we'll go to break.  Steven C. was taken every Monday off, and we put a stop to that, didn't we, Steve?  Didn't we?  It's a little joke, but the boys had fun with the Steve C. taken every Monday off bid. 
[02:12:30]  Oh.  And Derek came up with this.  Yes, now and forever.  I only meant until August.  Yeah.  For all eternity.  Forever and ever.  I meant six.  This is pretty much the conversation.  And I hope you remember.  I mean, we spent, what, an hour and a half on this?  Yeah.  Everyone was beating up Steve, like, what the fuck you're doing?  Taking every Monday off, blah, blah, blah.  Everyone knows the backstory, hopefully.  Yes.  He received a beating.  And Jimmy's going to be in Atlanta at the Punchline? 
[02:13:00]  Yes, tonight, 10 o'clock show, and then tomorrow and Saturday, a bunch of shows.  And you guys have always said, you know, there's a nice following down there, so hopefully  we'll see just that at Jim Norton's shows this weekend.  All right?  But first this, from Derek.  Who said life was all about following the rules?  Carleese.  Carleese.  I'm a man of leisure.  This summer.  Greg Hughes, it's Mr. Carleese.  You're an asshole.  Find out what happens when one executive producer discovers he has 50 sick days and decides 
[02:13:30]  to use them all.  Ah, the Prius.  If you have the means, I highly recommend you pick one up.  Starring Steve Carleese.  I want to eat in that restaurant.  I'm going to make a fake reservation with my new stomach.  And Steve Carleese as Steve Carleese.  Don't you know me?  I'm Abe Froman, the internet king of Jersey.  Look at the Foundry logos on everything.  We're shaking a baby now. 
[02:14:00]  Twist and shout.  Coming every Monday.  A family member has days off, and you give them crap?  You're an asshole.  Steve Carleese's day off.  Life goes by pretty fast.  If you don't take vacation time, you'll miss out on it.  Randy, you got to play through it, right? 
[02:14:30]  We need paying gigs, though.  Sick of this going from one porch to another.  Oh, my God.  You got these?  Opie and Anthony on your radio now.  Modula ablongata.  Dot, dot, dot.  We got Bobo prank phone calls.  We got Bobo voicemails.  Now, I was at FH Riley's on Saturday.  There was a little fan gathering. 
[02:15:00]  Right.  A nice-sized crowd.  Nothing too crazy.  But there was probably, I don't know, 25, 30 people there maybe.  Yeah.  30 listeners maybe.  And Bobo made the trip from Queens.  He certainly did.  And he was sitting at the bar, and he was talking to everybody inside.  And he was kind of a, he was a bit of a celebrity out there at FH Riley's.  Was he getting hammered?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And he was on the phone, and someone goes, he's calling Christina.  Oh.  And I'm like, fuck.  Because I'm like, God, this would make good radio, right? 
[02:15:30]  Yeah.  I was just handed the actual voicemails he was leaving from FH Riley's.  Oh, because he looked at the date and time?  Yeah, well, Christina's smart enough to, you know.  Yep.  To save all the voicemails for the radio show.  Good for her.  Uh-oh.  They're whispering over there.  What's happening?  Yeah, there's something going on.  What?  Hicksnack.  What happened?  We were just discussing what to do with certain things that Bobo brought in.  Oh, okay.  All right.  Shh.  Yeah.  Shh.  Shh.  Basically, we just, we need certain interns to give permission to do things off the air. 
[02:16:00]  Before they do it on the air.  You know what I'm saying?  No.  I don't deal with the paperwork.  No?  You guys deal with the fucking paperwork.  Yeah.  We're just trying to entertain our listeners.  Whatever.  But we do have something to do for it.  All right, good.  Okay.  What happened to Jimmy?  Yeah, the co-wee-wees.  Hi, Jimmy.  Hi, buddy.  We got, uh, we moved up the Bobo thing, because I know you got to leave very soon. 
[02:16:30]  I do, yes.  I have to.  We got Bobo voicemails.  We got Bobo prank calls.  And Bobo wants to show us, you know, what he did to himself.  Well, first, I have to see that.  I have to.  Yeah, I got to.  Can we start with the voicemails?  Sure.  Or the prank calls?  What do we do?  I want voicemails.  How does this work?  Voicemails.  Voicemails?  He's in a real.  Voicemails.  All right.  So, uh, Bobo's love for Christina has not, um, ended, obviously.  He's still trying.  And, uh, Christina's doing the right thing and making sure we got all the juicy audio for  our radio show.  Yes.  So, Bobo was, um, calling Christina all weekend long. 
[02:17:00]  Once again, getting the big blow off.  But he'll keep trying.  This kid is, uh, he's a, he's a go-getter.  So, Bobo leaves Christina a typical creepy message.  We start with this one today.  Hello, Christina.  It's me, Bobo.  Just wanted to let you know how we was going.  Uh, coming back as soon as you get this message.  Oh, I guess I'll, I guess I'll hear from you later. 
[02:17:30]  Have a good day.  Love you.  I love you.  Love you, Bobo.  I love you.  I love you.  I love you.  Love you.  God, what is, week I had, these messages were going on all week.  I had to sift through approximately 15 minutes of voicemails to get the, to get to the meat  of it, yeah.  Oh, my God.  Okay, it continues.  Bobo gives Christina his home phone number.  Oh.  2, 10 p.m.  Eastern Time.  Hello, Christina. 
[02:18:00]  It's me, Bobo.  I was wondering if you could call me on my, on my home number.  My home number is 718-  Oh, God.  3, 10 p.m.  Uh-huh.  Nice.  Don't, don't give this message to the, to anybody on the O&E staff.  Ah.  I don't have this phone number given out on the show.  Thank you, I think I'll speak, speak to you later, all of you.  Did he say Bobo, Christina, this is Bobo? 
[02:18:30]  Yeah, I don't know.  Oh, there's this embarrassing dick picture.  What is that?  It's his little penis.  Are you one here for the penis?  His weenie is so scared.  Has his ID been checked?  Is he over, is he over 18?  Yeah, yes.  He's like pushing 30 or something.  I'd say he has the genitals of a six-year-old.  That doesn't look like an adult male.  Well, he's had urinary tract problems.  Oh.  And had operations.  Oh, Bobo.  Stephen S. from Bayshore.  The fact that Bobo said about himself to a woman at Riley's, and Stephen S. quotes Bobo,  do you realize you're sitting next to a celebrity? 
[02:19:00]  That really made my night, Stephen.  Bobo said that?  Yes.  By himself?  Yeah.  Yeah, Bobo's very much a celebrity of himself.  Yes.  He likes to think of himself as a celebrity, yeah.  Now, Bobo is going to FH Riley's, so he calls Christina to get her to FH Riley's.  Hello, Christina.  It's me, Bobo.  Just letting you know that offer is still on the table.  If you want to stop by after your tournament, if I'm still around, if I'm going to check  out Stephen S. still around, we'll be at FH Riley's. 
[02:19:30]  Be sure to look out for me also if you're not, if you don't know about it, you know how  it went.  I'll be talking about it on my Twitter account, as always.  Hope to see you there.  God, good luck in the tournament.  I'm rooting for you.  Have a good day.  Love you.  Bye.  This is just sad. 
[02:20:00]  What, was she going to fuck with the retard tournament?  She wins.  I believe it was volleyball.  Oh.  It is sad.  Especially ending everyone with love you.  It really is very sad.  I love you, boy.  It is sad.  I love you, boy.  Love you.  Bobo, Christina, Bobo.  Who says their name first?  Bobo, Christina, Bobo.  Jim, Ope, Jim.  Who says that?  No one.  Bobo.  Ope, Ant, Ope.  Yeah.  What?  Jim, Ant, Jim.  What did he do?  That's all I want to do now is say my name around you. 
[02:20:30]  Yes.  Well, Ope, Jim, Ope.  He left another voicemail.  Oh, good.  Yeah.  Bobo calls Christina from FH.  Okay.  Rumor has it he was intoxicated at this point.  Well, I don't know there, Sam.  We are very, very strict on how much alcohol people.  Oh, good.  You know what it probably was?  He was just so joyful because FH Riley's is such a fun place to be.  Now that's smart.  Yeah.  Hello, Christina.  I'm leaving you another wonderful message for the radio. 
[02:21:00]  All right, listen.  Wow.  Now it looks really joyful.  All right.  He's very joyful, right, Sam?  Listen to him.  I've been to FH Riley's.  It's one of the funnest places a person could go.  Well, it's because of the balloon animals that we make for all the customers.  A lot of excitement.  Cotton candy.  Free cotton candy.  Yes.  To the pleasure in his voice.  What a difference from that.  Hi, it's Bobo, Bobo, Bobo, Bobo, Christina, Bobo.  Hello, Christina.  I'm leaving you another wonderful message for the radio on this phone, my friend's phone. 
[02:21:30]  Because the shitty AT&T does not get any signals here.  The offer is still on the table here.  Right now, if you want to show up.  Once again, good luck on the tournament.  Good luck on the tournament.  You're still on the call.  Hello? 
[02:22:00]  Ah, you've won.  End of message.  What a tool.  Wow.  Poor Bobo.  Still trying to get her to FH Riley.  Oh, yeah.  And then finally, Bobo calls Christina after the evening at FH.  Yeah, this is the ride home.  I guess some listeners gave him a ride home.  Yeah.  Because you can hear him in the background.  I think some listeners might have been coaxing him to do that.  Ah, to make the call.  Yeah.  Stop picking up.  Hello, Christina.  It's me, Bobo.  I'm on my way back home from FH Riley. 
[02:22:30]  Just letting you know, I had a great time.  You missed a great time tonight.  Sure.  It was an awesome time.  Opie was there.  Along with Pat from Anaki.  Steve from Bayshore was there.  Patty was there.  He was.  One of her friends was there.  I forgot her name.  Heather Height was there.  She was doing a good...  She showed up late, though.  Big A was there also. 
[02:23:00]  And who else was there?  I'm trying to think.  Who else was there?  Brother Elmo was there.  And I think Brett was...  Brother Brett was there.  Brother Brett.  It was a great time.  Wish you could have been there.  Yeah.  Hope you kick butt in that tournament.  I'll hear about it for...  I'll hear...  I'll hope you hear all about it Friday.  I'll leave a couple...  Or you can let me know on Twitter.  You know, I'm Mr. Med8 on Twitter. 
[02:23:30]  I'm in the works of posting pictures.  I...  As I said, I got a very crappy internet connection.  And I forget...  If that computer did not belong to my mom...  I would have wrecked that computer by now.  Holy shit.  The way OB wrecks radio equipment.  Oh, have a good night.  I love you.  We're no longer.  Oh, fuck.  God.  What a sad, sad message. 
[02:24:00]  And that's only a sample.  Oh, yeah.  Those were the...  That's the cream of the crop.  But they were at least...  Is it calling a lot?  You got one?  Oh, very much.  Do we got a voicemail from the motor room where he's just hanging out by himself waiting?  Yeah.  No, that hasn't...  Still keeping the dream alive?  Queen's motor room.  Still waiting.  Waiting for you.  And...  All right.  So, obviously, he gave out his number.  So then, of course, you got to start prank calling the Bobo Man.  Well, yes.  Danny, Travis, and me spent a lot of time calling Bobo.  This is just, again, a sampling. 
[02:24:30]  Some of them are not even recorded, believe it or not.  They're like the old Tonight Shows.  They get, you know, lost.  Gone.  Forever.  Actually, I think the majority of them aren't recorded.  It's only after we did, like, four in a row.  We're like, dude, we should get the recorder to record them.  Yeah.  Because Travis will just turn on the speakerphone and start dialing, and we'll just have to  run to the phone because it's time to call Bobo again.  But, uh...  See if you can figure out the direction we were going in this week.  All right.  Hello? 
[02:25:00]  Bobo, if your dick is so small, how does it smell so bad?  I have no idea.  You are not shaving it, that's why, which is going to be taken care of as we speak.  Yeah, but it's so small.  Like, how does it smell so bad?  He hangs up on you?  Yeah, I mean, he knows it's us now, so we just call and...  I'm going to run some guests by you.  Tell me what you think, okay?  Okay.  What do you think about James Gandolfini?  Yeah, that'd be a good one for the show. 
[02:25:30]  Yeah?  What about Jerry Seinfeld?  Seinfeld?  I'm shocked you guys would actually get him on the show all these years, but I guess that'd  be a good one.  How about Pierce Brosnan?  Pierce Brosnan.  I guess he's got a movie coming up that you guys are interested in seeing yet.  That'd be a good one.  How about Smelly Cock Bobo?  He doesn't like that, does he?  No. 
[02:26:00]  It's Homeless Bum Emporium.  Hey, Bubba, I got a serious question.  Wait, what did he say?  Homeless Bum Emporium.  Oh, okay.  It's Homeless Bum Emporium.  Hey, Bubba, I got a serious question, for real.  Like, did you shave your cock hair yet?  I'm shaving an infection.  All right, well, do me a fair, for all the cock hair from now on that you shave, can  you put it in, like, a bag and bring it in with you?  You want to bring it in? 
[02:26:30]  No problem.  Oh, one other thing.  Yeah?  Why is your cock so smelly?  It's very funny.  And he's down the hall with the bag?  He's down the hall with a shopping bag full of pukes.  Jimmy's got to leave very soon, so we've got to get to this.  Who's this?  This is Bobo, Daniel Bobo Carlin.  This is Bobo's agent speaking.  Why do you have the same name as Bobo, Bobo's agent?  This two people, Bobo is two people, Bobo and Daniel Carlin. 
[02:27:00]  And Daniel Carlin is his agent.  Oh, okay.  Well, in that case, we're looking to book somebody with a real smelly dick.  Can you help us?  I'm very sorry.  He left?  Yeah.  And then finally, we get tired of calling Bobo and call someone else.  Yeah, I think we dialed the wrong number on this one.  Oh, okay.  Let's see what's...  Hello?  Hey, Eric, quick question.  Yeah?  Why is your dick so smelly?  What was that? 
[02:27:30]  Why is your dick so smelly?  I don't know.  What do these guys do when we go home?  That was E-Rock in the office next door.  Just keep the channel live all day long so you guys can do this on the air for everybody.  We could smell his dick from the other office.  Holy shit.  That's very funny, man.  Let's get Bobo in here.  He's still staring at a picture of himself.  He's got the bag of pubes, I guess.  There we go.  Now it's 20 minutes down the hallway. 
[02:28:00]  Oh, I know.  With his little legs.  Does he have little legs?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, my God.  Look at him run.  Look at him.  He's a tiny-legged fool.  Listeners can't look at him run, but...  Wow.  That's as fast as he can run.  Ew, he has a bag.  Is that pubes in it?  Yes.  Let's make E-Rock hold it.  Now he's just going to talk over us.  He's the worst.  Here we go.  I couldn't stop laughing at those prank phone calls when they lived on the first time.  Hi, Bobo.  How's it going, Jimmy? 
[02:28:30]  Good, buddy.  Hey, Bobo.  Doing all right?  I'm doing all right.  What do you think about your mess?  See, I have to go to Atlanta.  My suggestion, just wear a seven-train shirt in Atlanta.  Why?  I don't know.  Just...  Boo!  Boo!  Boo!  I can't kill him a good one, but in this bag is a little something that, for E-Rock...  Where is he? 
[02:29:00]  Can we get E-Rock down here, Steve?  Can we have E-Rock come down?  Try and buy the free soda.  Might be over there.  Yeah.  He's grabbing it with his tongue like a fucking bullfrog.  He snatches it right out of the machine with his leathery, dry tongue.  I think he's crying because he can't get trans fat in the tri-state area anymore.  All right.  Probably right.  I wasn't going to crash him.  It's okay.  It's more fact than funny.  So, Bobo, you shaved all your pubes off?  I'm starting to shave them.  I was cutting some off yesterday. 
[02:29:30]  That razor hasn't arrived yet.  What are you, specially ordering a razor?  Yeah, that's it, please.  I'm ordering a separate electric razor to get...  Electric razor.  So, what did you shave it with, or how did you cut that off with?  No, I was just cutting some off with a tweezer.  Wait, what?  You were tweezing your pubes?  No way.  Yeah, I was cutting some off with a tweezer.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Did you pull them out with a tweezer?  Do you mean a scissor? 
[02:30:00]  Yeah, yeah, sort of like a scissor-like thing.  I don't know.  What the heck do you call those?  Small scissors?  It's a tweezer or scissors?  What is it?  I don't know.  I got two pairs of those small scissors that you find in the bathroom.  How long is it?  This is not a project, like a community development project.  I'm trying...  I don't know.  I got two sets of scissors.  One for removing cock hair.  The other one is for removing nose hair.  Oh, we do notice you do have a lot of nose hair. 
[02:30:30]  So what do you got in your hand right now?  Well, why don't E-Rock open the bag?  Or it doesn't.  Oh, really?  Yeah, open the bag.  Open it.  Oh, God.  I just threw the bag at E-Rock.  Open it.  And keep in mind, it's wrapped in layers.  Wrapped in layers?  Yeah.  Like individual slices of cheese?  No, the layers of plastic bag.  It smells worse.  Have you seen Christina?  I saw her.  Yeah?  Where?  I saw her right before she was headed to her show. 
[02:31:00]  Did she say hi?  Yeah, she did.  And?  She was too busy to talk, though, right?  Yeah, she said she's talking to me after her show.  Oh, cool.  All right, and in the bag is another bag.  What's wrong, E-Rock?  It's moving.  It's not moving.  It's the crabs in it.  You don't have crabs, right, Bubba?  No.  Not that I know of.  I think there'd only be crabs if I'd been laid.  You're right.  Or bedbugs.  Another bag.  What is this?  It's awful. 
[02:31:30]  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  I guess it's a lot.  Yeah, well, see, as you peel the layers back, it gets more and more transparent and opaque,  so I can now see pubes through the bag.  This is a psychopath.  How many bags, E-Rock?  I'm up to four now.  Oh, it's spilling out.  You're spilling it.  I'm just joking.  How many bags? 
[02:32:00]  This is not a jewel.  What's wrong with you?  Not the Hope Diamond.  Well, it's bags, so I want to keep...  I thought it'd be better off to keep it in layers.  That can't be all of it.  Let me see.  No, that's just a sample of it.  How much?  Lift it up.  That's what you...  That's what all those fucking bags have.  You could put it under your contact lens.  It wouldn't have bothered you.  Eight fucking hairs.  Let me see.  Oh, get the...  Yay, yay, yay, yay, yay.  Ew.  Oh, God.  Ten bucks to throw around it.  It's like a little hairball.  Oh.  A little hairball.  Ew, it is.  It's like... 
[02:32:30]  I don't have a good razor that can cut off more of it.  Buy a razor.  Buy a Mach 3, you psycho.  That's exactly what I was thinking, Danny.  Those Russian fucking figurines that one fits in another.  Only full of pubes.  Pubic hair.  How much do you have left, Bobo?  On your little weenie?  Bobo, can we glue the hair on your face?  No, no, no, no, no, no.  Why?  Now, wait a minute.  Why did you shave your face?  Because your girlfriend said...  Someone tried...  My sister shaved off half of it in my sleep. 
[02:33:00]  She just put my iPod on full blast, and I woke up and I noticed half my mustache was missing.  Wait, you didn't notice?  The music prevented you from feeling your face being shaved?  No, no, she did it before the music.  Holy shit.  What the hell?  You're a gem.  How did you not know it was happening?  I was...  I'm a deep sleeper sometimes.  You can have hair removed from your face while you're sleeping?  People can shave you? 
[02:33:30]  Well, I was dead tired from watching Planet of the Apes the night before.  Okay, I got a great joke.  Yep.  Sorry.  So why were you so tired from watching it?  That must be why I'm tired today.  I stayed up.  I stayed up.  I was up late watching it.  All right.  I was typing up some emails.  Yeah.  Then I watched the movie, and I freaking get asked for everything to deal with this dog problem. 
[02:34:00]  The dog kept barking.  It's random ideas and words that come out of his mouth.  No, my sister's dog.  She'll bark sometimes.  Your sister you call a dog?  No, my sister's dog.  Oh, oh.  All right, so your sister wants the neighbor's dog to stop barking.  Why?  No, no, no.  It was her dog.  All right.  Whose dog?  The neighbor?  No, my sister's.  Okay.  She's got a one-year-old beagle. 
[02:34:30]  Oh, they don't bark much.  Yeah, but actually, this one doesn't bark.  It howls.  No, see, that's what I meant.  They really bark a lot.  It does bark, right?  He's saying it doesn't.  It howls like a werewolf.  It goes like,  All right, listen.  That clip will never make it anywhere.  No.  We're losing Jimmy, because he's got to fly to Atlanta.  So could you at least...  And his arms are killing him.  Could you at least show...  Not on a plane.  Oh.  Could you at least show Jimmy what you've done so far?  Thanks, Joe.  To clean up the area.  Yeah.  Well, you weren't here last week when we all saw the horrific mess, and we're giving 
[02:35:00]  him tips, Jimmy.  So he gets the girl in the end.  This is Christina.  I don't have a good enough razor for this.  I got it.  Let me just see.  So maybe you see parts of this.  All right.  Just whip it out.  I'm fine.  You look good.  He gets very bothered showing...  Why?  Who cares?  A bunch of guys laughing at it.  I get to show doing this.  Why?  That's an excellent job of shaving.  You see what's been removed?  Nothing.  Where?  No, you see it's your penis.  Your penis.  Okay, Jimmy. 
[02:35:30]  No, no.  You don't have to be shy.  Hold on a second.  Because I was talking to Christine before.  I was kind of hoping that she would stop by, but I don't know.  Would you want to stand there, like, with her?  Standing here?  Would you like her to see your naked schlong?  She wants to see the before picture.  Yeah, because it's getting it all nice for her, Jimmy.  Oh, my God.  I'm trying to remove it.  That's the before picture.  What do you think?  Like, do you think about, like, having sex with her and, like, feeling her tits and stuff?  Yep. 
[02:36:00]  No, you do.  I didn't see it.  So you think about, like, what?  Putting your mouth on her tits?  Yeah.  And do you think about her ass?  Yeah.  So you think about, like, rubbing it?  And what about showering?  All getting her all soapy, right?  Yeah.  And just lathering her up?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Dude, he just fucking...  Do you think about lathering her up?  She has big boobs, doesn't she?  Yeah, she does.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  He does. 
[02:36:30]  Oh, my God.  He does.  He does.  Oh, my God.  Would you ever lick her boobs if you could?  Yeah.  I could...  Keep going, Jimmy.  Keep going.  She has big breasts.  What size do you think they are, like, C's?  I have no idea what size, but I know they're not too big.  Imagine if it was that easy.  They're just the right size.  They sure do.  What was that?  Oh, yeah.  I bet they would feel really good in the shower, wouldn't they?  Yeah.  They would.  Bobo, imagine what it would feel like the first time she touched your balls and your 
[02:37:00]  penis.  Would you let her wash your penis in the shower?  I think I am trying to get the smell...  Do you have anything out of order to get the smell out?  The smell of what?  Oh, the dick.  Oh, my God.  Would you let her soap it up with a penis in the shower?  Yeah, I would.  This is so fucked up.  Yeah?  I would.  You would let her soap it up?  Yeah, I would.  And she would kind of, like, pull on it and soap it up?  Yeah, yeah, I would.  And you would be rubbing her ass at the same time? 
[02:37:30]  Yeah, I would.  And what if she, like, said, go ahead, if she wanted to rub her butt on you a little  bit, would you let her?  Heck, yeah, of course.  Well, she backed up, like, she backed her ass up right into your dick.  Like, and just started rubbing her ass on her while soapy.  Back that ass!  Back that ass!  Up.  Yeah.  Jesus Christ!  Is that easy?  Running around the...  It did reverse.  What are you thinking about right now, Bobo? 
[02:38:00]  Oh, that's what you're saying.  You're putting his image in my head.  All right.  Well, anyway, what about the Mets?  What do you think their problem is this season?  Yeah, the Mets are not doing very well at all.  Too many injured players.  You think it is?  Yeah.  Yeah.  At this rate, we need a 10-game winning streak.  Oh, boy.  That's going to be a problem, right?  Yes, definitely.  Something right before the injured guys come back.  Yeah, yeah.  And they start winning bowl games.  How do they lose against the worst team in baseball, though?  Twice.  In a row like that.  Not scoring enough runs.  Yeah? 
[02:38:30]  Not scoring enough runs.  A bunch of guys that are normally sitting on a bench.  Yeah.  And mostly pinch hit.  They always seem to get their big hits when they're pinch hit.  Are you a Yankee fan?  Do you want to see the Yankees doing well or no?  All I can say is I don't...  He's losing.  I'm not a Yankee fan, but I don't usually root for them.  Right, right.  I just don't usually say anything.  Wait, let me give it a little bit more because I want to know more about this Yankee thing.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  What's the Yankee thing?  He even got in trouble, too.  What I have been known to do is that every time the Yankees win the World Series, what 
[02:39:00]  I do is I buy the hat and the shirt from my uncle.  Really?  Fair enough.  The one that works at the motel?  No, the one that's the deputy sheriff in Florida.  Oh.  Oh, I didn't know that.  Yeah, I think I mentioned it before.  I thought it was the guy that owned the motel that you wanted to take Christine to.  He doesn't own the motel.  He works there.  You see him at the front.  He's at the front desk.  I thought it was that one, the motoring that you wanted to take Christine to. 
[02:39:30]  No.  What would you do with it there at the motel?  Lay her on the bed?  Yeah.  Lay her on the bed, and then as she lifts her hips up, you slowly pull the panties off  and see her pussy for the first time, right?  Yeah.  What would that be like, right?  Oh, yeah.  I'd dive in.  Would you?  I'd dive in, and I'd go up, and I'd let her just shove it right in.  Time for another sound of that.  I'd let her just shove it right in this.  He's the boner kid. 
[02:40:00]  Wow.  What the fuck?  Un-fucking-believable.  You've got to be kidding me.  It's doing push-ups.  It's the worst I've ever seen.  It is the worst.  It is an atrocity.  It's an abomination.  I just hope what they say actually happens when they say that this is a powerful boner.  I hope she thinks it's a powerful one.  We never said it was a powerful boner.  Can you imagine if she kissed it?  That'd probably be too much.  Wow.  What about that, Bobo?  She probably kissed it, like, wet kisses and stuff.  If she did that? 
[02:40:30]  Yeah.  Bobo, what if she was topless in front of you?  And then, yeah, you know, and then she went to town on that.  Starts kissing it.  Oh, she can do it all she wants, baby.  Yeah.  Don't call me baby.  No, I'm talking to Christina.  Oh, that's the same way I say to Christina.  Oh, okay.  Well, I hope my plane hits a mountain.  Well, I can tell you, I can tell you, if she was on a plane with me, I think I'd probably 
[02:41:00]  have a full membership to the Mile High Club.  Oh, wow.  Hey.  Yeah.  The two and a half inch high club.  Yeah, but I'm trying.  You want to get to eight, right?  She told me about enlargement pills.  Yes.  And she knows the ones that work.  They're not actually enlargement pills.  They just shrink the rest of you.  No.  I want to find the ones that work.  I want to get it bigger.  I want to get it to at least eight inches.  Have you pictured being inside her yet? 
[02:41:30]  And what that would feel like?  Wow.  What would that feel like?  How long do you think you'd last with her?  Yeah, what would that feel like?  Just pumping it in and out, right?  I don't know.  I'd try to last as long as I could.  Yeah, but how long do you think you would?  No, I think I'd go the extra mile.  I'd try to go for an hour and a half.  An hour and a half?  And she asked for more.  I think I could get more.  Would you pump her really good?  Yeah.  And suck her boobs?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Reach, grab her hips.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Jesus Christ. 
[02:42:00]  She's got some swollen mushroom.  Holy shit.  What the fuck?  You got a NASCAR hat?  What is that?  Yeah.  You like NASCAR?  Oh, NASCAR rules.  Who's your favorite driver?  Jeff Gordon.  Jeff Gordon, why?  Like, what's so big about it?  Let's just say the first race he won.  What's so special about Jeff Gordon?  Let's just say the way he won that race, coming from behind, almost falling a lap down.  What race?  1997 Daytona 500.  Oh, that was a while ago.  And that pass he pulled off.  Yeah.  The way he was able to pull that pass and not even get caught in the wreck as a, I don't 
[02:42:30]  know, the wind or something.  Right.  Of his car just, I think it caused Dale Earnhardt to flip.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I remember that one.  What do you think of the driver, Dick Trickle?  Well, I know.  Remember him?  You don't remember Dick Trickle, the driver?  Well, I remember the name, but I don't remember.  I hardly remember a top five finish.  Oh, what about like the old days, Daryl Waltrip?  Yeah, I've watched some of his footage on YouTube. 
[02:43:00]  Oh, you have?  Yeah.  Favorite NASCAR announcer, by the way.  It's my favorite NASCAR announcer, by the way.  Is it?  Sure.  Yeah.  Danny, you got something to show maybe, Bobo?  Maybe some NASCARs?  Well, is Bobo a fan of Danica Patrick, perhaps?  She's freaking hot.  Yeah.  Yeah, you like Danica Patrick?  Yeah.  Yeah, she is right there, Bobo.  Holy shit.  Yeah.  Wow.  She probably...  Look at that ass.  Damn, man.  I don't know how she fits into an IndyCar that feels like a chardine can. 
[02:43:30]  Imagine being squished in there with her, though, and that little butt pressing against  your crotch.  Yeah.  A chardine can.  Yeah.  Well, really, it is.  What kind of can is she in?  I can't hear you.  No, I said that IndyCar feels like a chardine can.  Oh, my God.  I once took a photo in one, by the way.  A chardine can.  Private weapon's name is Sarlene, sir.  I took a photo.  You have a shmaldick.  Of course, I wouldn't mind if she helped me pull out, but then I'd love to pull back 
[02:44:00]  in.  Sound effect time.  Oh, yeah, of course.  It's the barricade.  Wasn't I supposed to do this in sweatpants?  Look at that picture.  Wow.  Look at her ass.  Oh, my God.  What would you do to that ass, Bobo?  Look at those legs.  Oh, I tell you, I think maybe I'd go 200 on her.  Yeah.  200? 
[02:44:30]  What do you mean 200?  What does that mean?  Literally feel like 200.  Really?  No, you know what I mean.  No, I don't.  No, I'd ram her at 200.  You'd ram her at 200?  Yeah.  What are you talking about?  No.  I'd ram her as fast as I go on the LAE if I feel like speeding.  So you're going to give her eight times your IQ?  No, no, no, no, no.  Danny, you want to show him something maybe a little?  I know it's low.  It's not good.  It's not good.  It's a poster high?  Jimmy, is this unbelievable?  It's horrendous. 
[02:45:00]  It's fucking...  Wow.  Yeah.  Depending on what we're talking about.  Oh, wow.  Imagine doing that.  It's looking at a hot dog that a dog has eaten half of.  That's what John Wayne Bobbitt saw when he woke up.  All right, guys, I have to...  What?  You're going to...  Yeah, I hate to walk out and go to this fucking radio gem, but...  Ow.  Oh, Jimmy.  Yeah?  Wow.  I saw something, but thanks for that.  Wow, that chick is getting fucked.  Wow, Bobo, take a look at that as we get Bobby Lee in there. 
[02:45:30]  Imagine doing that.  Bobby Lee's going to be at Caroline's.  He wants to come in and say hi.  You've never done that before, Bobo?  No.  I'm going to do that.  You know what that feels like?  Look at that.  Oh, that feels good.  I want to do that to Christina.  Yeah, think about doing that to Christina.  Yeah, go ahead.  Give it a good look.  I want to do that to Christina.  Yeah?  Oh, my God.  Look at that now.  Do what?  Take a look so you get, you know...  Oh, I want to do that to her.  So you do it right there.  Look at that.  Oh, my God.  Imagine that was her and that guy was you.  Take care, guys.  I'll see you. 
[02:46:00]  Monday morning.  Woof.  That is evil.  I don't know where you're trying to wake me up.  See you soon.  Are you looking at the screen there, Bobo?  Someone will try to wake me up.  I'm talking about pumping Viagra into my coffee.  Oh, really?  I'm talking about waking me up, handing me a cup of coffee.  Yeah.  Fucking balloon hands.  That's what he's...  Bobo, look.  He's just rambling in a closet.  Girls like it that way.  So study this.  Wow.  Study this video, will you?  Oh, yeah.  She's fucking hot.  Get Bobby Lee in here. 
[02:46:30]  I'm getting a boner.  What do you think, Bobo?  Take a look.  Tell the audience what they're...  What are you doing, Bobo?  Bobo.  No, no, no, no.  Bobo.  Tell the audience what you're looking at.  I'm looking at a girl getting fucked in the ass hard.  That's not her ass.  Bobo, let's fill your kin so you don't hurt anyone.  That is not her ass.  That's her pussy.  Bobo.  Yeah.  No?  Sorry about that.  Oh, my God.  I'm sorry about that. 
[02:47:00]  That was the Bobo in a bit.  Oh, my God.  No, Bobo.  I didn't want to embarrass...  Oh, my God.  Bobo, I didn't want to embarrass Bobby Lee, the funny...  Bobo, how are you hard on...  Bobo, didn't we meet out there?  Wait a minute.  We met out there, right?  Hold on.  Bobo.  I was talking about the funniest...  Bobo, Jimmy, this is...  He's just replacing Jimmy for the last hour, so come on.  We're in the middle of a bit.  Well, I didn't want to creep out Bobby Lee.  Bobby's too late.  I already saw all of it.  Yeah, it's cool.  By the way, it's bigger than mine, so do it.  Aw. 
[02:47:30]  Well, I think that would be obvious.  Why?  Why, dude?  Why?  Why?  Because I'm Asian?  Is that why?  No, because I heard rumors somewhere on some gossip site.  That my penis was small?  Which one, dude?  Seriously.  Is that why I'm not getting laid?  Tell me.  No, because...  Well, I'm guessing maybe it's above average.  Oh, yeah, it's above average.  Thank you very much.  So for Asians, that's good.  Yeah, I know.  And why did you say you think yours is bigger?  Yeah.  I don't know, because he thinks it's bigger, because maybe there's something wrong with his size.  Boy, his excuses stink. 
[02:48:00]  Or maybe he was jealous of my size.  Bubba, we're in the middle of a bit, though.  You're ruining our...  You're ruining the bit.  Do it, Bubba.  Yeah.  All right, I'm getting douche chills from this one.  Yeah, so we're waiting.  Why?  You don't like Bobby Lee?  No, but I get douche chills every time.  Just look at me while you do it.  Oh, no, no, no.  Just look at me.  Oh, the little string.  Does he have the...  Oh, no, no, no.  I can only...  I can only gain what size.  What is that?  I can only...  I can only gain half one eye on this. 
[02:48:30]  It's like a...  It's been to Nom or something.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  It's like John McCain.  That's John McCain.  It's John...  Holy shit.  Holy...  What is the red swelling?  No, that's from, uh...  You know.  No, I don't know.  That's from a stiffy.  Oh, from a stiffy?  I get those all the time.  I don't get red bumps.  Yeah, what is that?  Yeah, what is that?  I don't know.  It gets like that.  Thanks to all the frickin' operations.  You're not looking at Bobby.  Look at Bobby.  Just look at me.  Look at my eyes.  Whoever frickin' messed up that operation... 
[02:49:00]  Yeah?  Whoever messed it up that operation...  Dr. Mengele.  Yeah, Mengele, yeah.  Well, I don't know who the heck messed it up.  He made a lampshade out of the rest of his dick.  But 48 operations caused me...  This problem caused me not that lack in size.  Evil Knievel didn't need 48 operations.  And your dick, by the way, looks like him after the Caesars Palace game.  Sound effect time.  Now that he's mad at the doctor.  I know.  Now it's...  Is that hard right now or no? 
[02:49:30]  No.  No, it's not.  No, he perpetually sticks out like that.  This is unbelievable.  Yeah.  I walked into that.  Yeah, you really did.  You literally almost walked into it.  Now, Bobby, he's got this girl, Christina, that he's really into, right?  Yeah, Cobo.  Really into this girl, Christina.  Think about Christina Nakey with those big, heavy breasts of hers.  The nice ass, right?  Kisses her neck.  She's cute, right?  She's cute, right?  She's freaking hot, you see?  Got a nice body on her. 
[02:50:00]  She's freaking hot.  The hottest thing in Brooklyn.  Got a nice body on her, right?  The hottest thing in Brooklyn, damn it.  Bobby, you see any changes?  I freaking want to cross the Manhattan Bridge right now.  Oh, what would you do?  I want to cross the Manhattan Bridge.  No, no, no, no.  I think I might go down the Holland Lincoln Tunnel.  Oh, my God.  I might go down the Holland Lincoln Tunnel with this.  We should put him out to parties, I'm telling you.  Parties.  Who wouldn't want to sit around and drink and watch?  Bachelorette parties. 
[02:50:30]  Right.  It looks like Ed Gein or something, man.  Ed Gein.  It's awful.  How amazing.  It's that easy, though.  It's Buffalo Bill in a woman's suit.  This is what I'm trying to get.  Oh, my God.  It's a rager now.  Now, Bobby Lee.  It's a rager.  It's a rager.  It's a rager.  Now watch, though.  Bobo, you also, you know, besides Christina, you're a big fan of the Mets.  Bobby Lee just walked in.  He's a big baseball fan.  Talk about the Mets with Bobby Lee.  I'm a little bit upset.  Tell them what their problem is.  What's the problem with the Mets?  Too many injured players. 
[02:51:00]  Too many injured players at the same time.  You could do good with one guy injured, but not everybody.  They can't all be out on the DL, right?  Right.  Yeah, everybody's freaking on the DL, it feels like.  Everybody's on the DL except for D, right?  But you know what, Bobo?  You're very smart when it comes to the Mets and baseball.  What do they need to do to turn the whole thing around?  They still got a shot.  I'm back from injuries that somehow get another pitcher.  Like who?  Like who? 
[02:51:30]  Matt Holiday.  Matt Holiday.  A lot of people say Matt Holiday would be the cure for the Mets problem.  What's his pitch?  What's his forte?  I've only heard about him because you don't see him a lot.  No.  The thing is, I would have to know somebody who's watched the Yankees a lot because they're  in the Yankees division.  Yeah, yeah.  And now he's back to a Rosenberg.  Rosenberg.  I need to ask somebody who's watched Thumbelina.  Thumbelina Thumbelina Thumbelina. 
[02:52:00]  Who seems to have the DS network as their turn on channel.  It's magic.  It's actually like magic.  It really is magic.  Watch how easy the other way.  Of course, me, though, on Time Warner Cable.  You turn on the TV, SNY is the channel that comes on when you turn it on the TV.  All right, look, look.  It's just about God.  Let's think about Christina.  Because she's going to be off working about an hour.  Christina is going to be off.  Are you going out with her?  No, there ain't anything scheduled.  I've been trying to tell her.  Would you like to see her shower?  Oh, my God. 
[02:52:30]  Yeah.  I would love to sweat, right?  Imagine her showering.  I'm going from head to toe.  I would love to see her shower.  She drops the soap.  She bends over to pick it up.  Oh, my God.  You'd look right up there.  She locks eyes with you?  And ask me to go get it.  Yeah.  Ask me to go get it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Ask me to go get it.  That's right.  Lather her up.  You know you want it, Christina.  Yeah.  You know you want it.  You know you want it.  You know you want it.  Holy shit.  Oh, my God.  It's magic. 
[02:53:00]  It is magic.  There's a picture of Christina right there on the screen for you.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's a picture.  That looks like I created a nice headshot from a picture I took with her.  Yeah.  Looks like your dick took a headshot from Lee Harvey Oswald.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, but the thing is, I need freaking enlargement pills.  I need something to make it bigger.  You need a dermatologist is what you need.  Yeah.  What is that?  Yeah, the last thing that thing should be is big.  Yeah.  It would be really frightening. 
[02:53:30]  It's like fucking Cloversfield.  I think it's how it feels.  I think it's how it feels.  That's the big part.  You got to use proactive, I think.  Yeah, it needs proactive.  I've been trying to cure this.  P. Dickie.  What is wrong with it, though?  I don't need the operations.  The operations, okay.  All the operations.  Don't talk about the operations.  It makes them very upset.  I'm sorry.  What's wrong with you, Bobby?  Would they fucking operate with a chainsaw?  I don't know what they did, but you can see the freaking scars.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, they're all over the place.  You see, like, scars here.  Where's the actual hole at?  I can't see the hole. 
[02:54:00]  Right there.  Okay, yeah, there it is.  Okay.  You have an idea how many times it's closed up from whatever the heck it is because of  my condition, it's closed up.  There have been problems it's closed up.  Oh, boy.  I've even had painful urination.  Oh, my God.  It's weird, though.  Very painful.  I'm playing the Caroline's tonight.  Oh, right.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Bobby Lee will be at Caroline's.  All right, Bobo.  Bobo.  I practically sat on a toilet.  Practically? 
[02:54:30]  No, no, no.  I spent long hours on a toilet trying to get that painful pee out.  It's such a painful, I had to be rushed to Columbia Presbyterian.  Really?  Wow.  I don't even think it's called that anymore.  Still called pee.  Yeah, yeah.  I think it's called New York Presbyterian now.  Oh, all right.  At least that's what I heard.  Uh-huh.  Doesn't really matter, does it?  Yeah.  When you can't piss, you don't care what the fuck the name of the place is.  It's called the Open My Pisshole Hospital. 
[02:55:00]  Please.  Whatever, it's the scariest sight to have to walk into that building, because I know I'm  going to have to go through another operation, possibly, and I'm going to wake up in deep  pain for probably having to, I mean, once again, open up a pee hole.  It's like an earring that closes up, an earring hole, right?  I'm just glad it's been ages since I've had to, uh, since they've had to remove a  cathra, which is the most painful experience. 
[02:55:30]  I hate that.  I hate it.  Yeah.  I hate it.  It's so painful.  And I heard, and I read in the newspaper, it's the cause of urinary infections.  Ah.  So they're trying to phase that out, I heard.  Yeah, they're trying to phase it out.  It doesn't work.  It doesn't work.  Now, now they, now they realize it now.  They should have realized that in the 1980s.  Dude, it's just a picture of her.  I should realize Wang Chung sucked, too, but.  Now he's looking at a picture of Christina. 
[02:56:00]  All I know is that.  Back into position.  I don't know.  I always, I swear, if I had a DeLorean right now, I would love to see how, I have a weird  feeling I'd probably make it big as an 80s pop star if I, if I spent a month in 1985.  A month in 1985.  One month.  Bobby, one month.  Yeah, this is weird, dude.  Michael J. Fox did it in like a day.  You want to give this a try, Bobby?  For a week.  Just, just talk to him about Christina.  I need a long enough amount of time in 1985. 
[02:56:30]  Listen to Bobby Lee.  Listen to Bobby Lee.  Enough with the DeLorean.  Yeah.  Christina calls you, right?  Says to pick, pick, pick her up, right?  You pick her up, right?  If she's wearing a mini skirt, listen, she's wearing a mini skirt, right?  You see her legs, okay?  And you see a little bit of her pubes through the skirt, right?  Yeah.  And she goes, you want some of this?  And she lifts up her skirt, right?  And then you see the whole thing, right?  It's very tight, tighter than you ever thought, okay?  And it's glistening, like it's moist, right?  She goes, touch it, right?  So you stick your two fingers inside it. 
[02:57:00]  It's tight, very moist.  And she looks at you.  She's almost crying, like it feels so good, you know?  And then she goes, let's do it in the back seat.  No condom.  No condom.  You don't know if you can last, right?  So you stick it in, right?  And you're about to come.  But you know you concentrate because you don't want to.  You want to satisfy her.  And she goes, it's the biggest thing I've ever felt, right?  You start stroking, stroking, stroking.  It's the greatest sensation you've ever felt in your life.  It's beyond your wildest dreams, right? 
[02:57:30]  You grab her ass.  Her ass is so soft, right?  So soft.  And you can feel little hairs on her ass, you know what I mean?  The invisible kind, you know, the kind that you see the sun when they're laying out, right?  And you're pumping away, pumping away, right?  And she comes first.  And you know what?  It gets even more moist when she does it, right?  It's her pussy juice is running down your leg, right?  You feel like a master dog, right?  And then you slowly nut.  This is weird, guys.  This is really weird, dude. 
[02:58:00]  I felt bad doing that.  He's about ready to.  Yeah, is it?  Yeah, yeah.  Without even touching himself.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  She goes, keep going.  Keep going.  Keep going.  I'm about to come.  I'm about to come.  Oh, wow.  Look at the picture.  She stops for a while, and she wants to suck your dick.  She stops.  She starts sucking your dick.  She sucks your dick, and now to the balls, right?  Just put a window with her face in it over the top of a naked girl picture. 
[02:58:30]  She looks like Miss Giant Head.  You've got to use a better picture.  She's getting picky now.  If you've got to superimpose your face, you've got to do a better job like those fake celebrity  photos.  Jesus.  Do you do that at home?  Do you Photoshop her face?  I was going to say, if this comedy thing doesn't work out for Bobby, you can do story time.  Kids gather around.  That's bad.  Okay, now we've got that.  The size is better. 
[02:59:00]  Now we've got it.  Look at that.  Look at that.  What do you think, right, Bobo?  Yeah.  Bobo.  Bobo.  It just makes noises.  Imagine slipping it right in there.  Bobo, look at the picture.  Look at the picture.  She shaved just for you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  See her.  She's so soft.  See her.  I never felt anything more soft.  It's like pure silk, you know?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah. 
[02:59:30]  Yeah.  She gently kisses you.  She sticks a tongue in your mouth.  I wish there was a porn star here right now to just really put the image in my head.  Yeah.  A hot porn star.  Ron Jeremy?  No.  No.  A female porn star.  Okay.  Sorry.  Two ladies.  Possibly the ones that boobie squashed me.  Boobie squashed?  Yeah.  I'm peeking in.  Who's peering?  See what that's going on?  Who's leering? 
[03:00:00]  A bunch of people peeking in.  There's a curtain there for a reason.  And because of Bobby Lee, there's a bunch of people that have joined the Bobo Boner Club.  Mostly truck drivers out there.  Oh, my God.  Kind of lonely out there.  Don't tell me there's people peeking in.  No.  No, they're not peeking in, man.  No, they're not peeking in.  No, but you're peeking at Christina.  Yeah.  She left her...  You're peeking at two and a half?  Yeah.  I wish I had it bigger.  Yeah.  Well, who doesn't, right? 
[03:00:30]  Yeah.  I've been upset that when I realized it was three and a half inches, I knew it wasn't big enough.  Wow.  Wow.  What I wouldn't give to have a bigger cock, even if it's just for one year, even if it's  just for one night.  Have you tried extents?  Does that work?  With the pill?  Yeah, the pill.  Well, that's a good picture.  I would love you to do a bit.  Just make me try it.  Keep trying it.  Keep tracking to the progress.  Yeah.  Look at that Bobo, right?  That looks just like her.  It looks just like her.  That's very similar, right?  It looks similar to her. 
[03:01:00]  Body tight.  Yeah, that looks similar, huh?  Oh, yeah.  Though I can imagine her boots would probably be much bigger, though.  Really?  Well, her arms are up.  You like those big boobs, huh?  Oh, I've seen the picture.  I'm telling you.  What?  That water in Brooklyn, I think it's a different reservoir than the one that supplies the water  into Queens.  I know there's three reservoirs.  The Delaware, the Catskills.  And the small dick reservoir that you drank from.  And what's the name of the third one in the state of New York?  Could someone get that information? 
[03:01:30]  No.  Where the heck is Stuck Brain when you really need them?  No, we can't get that info.  We don't need that info.  Oh, wow.  Well, I need to know, but which one supplies the water to Brooklyn?  Could somebody tell me that one?  The never sink.  It's the one you swim in.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I need to know which one supplies the water to Brooklyn.  By the way, if Christina hears this, I hope she do know that there's a pool at the backyard  of my house.  You could hop over the fence.  Yeah. 
[03:02:00]  Yeah.  And then what?  Then what happens?  Hop over the fence.  One of these days, my mother's away.  And my grandmother ain't.  And no one else in town.  Yeah.  And then what happens?  Probably except for my freaking uncle.  Bobby, who cares who's in town?  All right.  No, Bobby, who cares?  She hops over.  What happens?  What happens?  Get to the point.  Oh, my God.  Look at that.  Hemingway.  Oh, Bobo, look at that.  Well, what happens is.  Bobo, look what we found for you.  I just keep hearing my Uncle Ray calling on his cell phone.  He's out of town. 
[03:02:30]  All right.  They're all out of town.  What happens?  Well, I'm hoping someone calls on my cell phone and says, pipe down.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They're not in town, dude.  They don't have cell phones.  They're in Russia.  They're all in Russia.  She hops over the fence.  Tell me what happens.  Oh, she hops over the fence.  Yeah, we're over the fence.  She just starts heading into the pool.  Yeah.  What is she wearing?  No, I hope she does the Phoebe Cates thing.  Oh, she does do it.  Yeah.  I want to see her do that.  Yeah.  She's got a diving board done, right?  She's got a diving board?  I want. 
[03:03:00]  Well, there's no diving board.  Forget it.  If you did have one.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's if it was Uncle Mike's pool.  Oh, yeah.  She would do the Phoebe Cates thing.  Yeah.  Smash your head like a gremlin.  I would love to see that.  Uncle Mike's pool, she comes out, she pops out, starts going up to me.  Yeah.  Starts pulling off the top.  Yeah.  Keep going.  You know.  Walk us through.  She starts going at it.  She starts pulling me into the pool.  Yeah.  Then she just goes right at me.  What does she do?  She just goes right. 
[03:03:30]  She just.  Doesn't anyone fucking knock anymore?  She just rams herself on me.  She just rams herself on, on me.  Yeah.  And just making me keep going.  Sure.  How does it feel?  She says she's going as long as she wants to go.  She ain't stopping.  She ain't stopping until she gets the big payoff.  Yeah.  What's the big payoff?  Some other guy coming in the room.  Oh, she's talking about me just really getting it in her.  Yeah. 
[03:04:00]  Hey, really.  She, she, she wants, he wants to double cum at the same time.  Sure.  Double cum.  Double cum.  I love that.  She, she, she, she starts.  Isn't that the best when you double cum at the same time?  I like grape flavor.  Double, double cum.  Double cum.  It's so good.  So delicious.  It's flavorless.  Long, long, long time.  She wants it.  She puts the.  What does she want?  She's just.  Acne on her vagina?  No.  She just shoves the bump, bumpiest condom she could find on me.  What?  Because she wants extra.  Oh, European condoms.  The bumpy kind. 
[03:04:30]  A smooth one on your dick would turn into a bumpy condom.  No, she wants the bumpiest.  She wants extra bumpy.  Built in fucking bumps.  Your dick is ripped for her pleasure.  Yeah.  It's just she wants extra bumps.  Oh, extra bumps.  Extra bumps.  She wants more extra bumps.  Yeah.  That's good.  It's called herpes.  I'm talking about that.  Yeah.  And then after the pull, she drags me into her car.  Yeah, she drags.  She just told me he's leaking.  No, no.  She pulls me into her car.  She says, you're heading somewhere with me, Bobo. 
[03:05:00]  You're heading somewhere with me.  Yeah.  You're going to.  I'm taking you somewhere.  I'm taking you to a nice hotel in Brooklyn.  She takes me.  She just starts.  She just starts pushing me onto the bed and says, you're on.  I'm going.  She just starts going right on me.  Yeah.  She just starts going right on me.  Someone's suggesting you just wrap the, um, that, you know, those candy dots on the paper. 
[03:05:30]  Just wrap that around your dick.  God damn.  Holy shit.  Oh, my God.  Oh, God.  Oh, my God.  It's crying.  It's crying.  She just wants me to jizz right on her.  It's so sad.  She wants you to jizz.  Oh, my God.  What happened?  Oh, my God.  What happened?  Oh, my God.  What just happened?  Oh, my God.  It looks like a rabid python.  What's that?  What is happening there?  Bobo, what's happening?  Bobo, what's happening?  Bobo, what's going on?  Describe what's going on over there. 
[03:06:00]  No, Bobo has not touched anything.  No, Bobo, what's happening over there?  What's happening over there?  It just seeps out.  Holy shit.  I was supposed to wear the famous sweatpants.  Yeah.  What just...  Oh, God damn it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  What just seeps out, Bobo?  What seeps out, Bobo?  I don't know.  I think I see the pre-sleeping out.  Yeah, yeah.  The what?  The Prius.  Prius.  A Prius came out? 
[03:06:30]  An electric car?  Well, no, pre.  Pre.  Oh, God.  A lot of pre.  That's more solid than liquid, I think.  Because that thing just wrapped around your thing.  Yeah.  Well...  It's pre-concrete.  Yeah.  All right, where were we?  Elmer's glue.  It's Elmer's glue.  Oh, my God.  This is...  Unbelievable.  Horrific.  Horrific.  Where are we at, Bobo?  What?  So...  It's just...  Here comes the tune.  It just comes in on our own. 
[03:07:00]  What the hell is it?  What just happened to your voice?  Straight as a Neil Diamond for a second.  What happened to your voice?  I don't know.  Oh, well, we could hold this.  Hold what?  Hold it to the stiffy.  What do you mean?  What will happen?  You want it to go down?  Bobby, talk to me.  I need to wipe it off.  Bobby, pump up the pool story.  Listen.  Listen to me.  The pool story...  She starts...  She's just going right hard at me.  Yeah.  She's going right hard at me.  Yeah.  And for some reason, she just goes... 
[03:07:30]  It just makes me go pussy diving.  Yeah.  I'm talking about diving.  Watch the video, too.  I'm talking about going to the deep end of the pool.  Oh.  You have two fingers in her, dude.  Right?  And you're licking her clitoris.  Oh.  And she loves it.  She loves it.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  She loves it.  She loves it.  She goes, don't stop.  Keep doing it.  She wants me to service...  She says, service my clitoris.  Yeah, service it.  Yeah.  Linger longer.  And her clitoris is pink.  And she says, service my clitoris.  Linger longer.  Linger longer, yeah. 
[03:08:00]  I heard it.  Yeah.  She wants me to linger...  It's a tragedy.  It's like a cranberry song, I think.  She wants me to linger longer.  By the way, Danny found a video that I'm ready to jerk off to.  I swear to God.  I know.  I'm getting hard.  Danny found the hottest fucking girl-on-girl video ever.  Ever.  Oh, my gosh.  She wants me to work for that in-  No.  Oh, my God.  Shut up.  Shut up, Bobo.  I'm jerking off over here.  Who wouldn't?  You're not the only one jerking off.  God damn.  Who wouldn't?  Who wouldn't?  Who wouldn't? 
[03:08:30]  All right.  Easy there, big fella.  I would be so happy if she just made a nice video for me to jerk off to.  She made a nice DVD.  High definition.  Blu-ray.  Yeah.  Carl from Sling Blade should put your dick in a cardboard box  and bury it in the yard.  Little fella.  I don't know about that, but it looks big when it's fully erect.  It was a little wiener. 
[03:09:00]  Holy shit.  You want to touch it?  Touch it a little bit.  Just touch it a little bit.  Just the tip.  Yeah, it's sensitive.  Look at that.  No?  No.  What's the matter?  What's the matter?  Look at that video.  Wow.  I'm not asking you to fight it.  Just gently touch it.  I just put...  You know what I mean?  Don't put it in the leg lock, right?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, there it is.  Come on.  Sina.  You know you want it.  You know you want it.  You're bending over right there.  Oh, you like that angle, right?  Oh, yeah.  That angle.  That's a nice shot. 
[03:09:30]  She's just waiting for it.  Now she's going to eat it.  She's waiting for it.  Please eat it.  Yeah.  Yeah, she wants you to eat it right now, dude.  She's waiting.  She says, Bobo, I'd like you to meet a guest who's joining us.  Her name is Brie Olsen.  She's going to join us.  Yeah, Brie Olsen's there.  Yeah.  She brings in Brie Walker.  She brings...  Can't even give you a handjob.  She says, I want you to meet some of my...  I know you've...  I want you to meet some of the girls you've jacked off to. 
[03:10:00]  Yeah, wow.  Yeah, wow.  Look at this.  Now there's a strap-on scene.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  She says, is it okay if you and Brie double-team me?  Well, is it?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, it is.  Oh, okay.  I just wanted to make sure.  Me and her double-team Christina.  Yeah.  Then she says, Bobo, why don't we double-team Brie? 
[03:10:30]  And I say, oh, yeah.  I'd love to try that.  Yeah.  And then they double-team you, don't they?  No.  Okay.  Oh, wow.  She just goes right at it.  She goes right at it.  Yeah, look at that.  Like that, Bobo?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then she all of a sudden tries to bring me into a room that replicates this studio.  Yeah.  Why?  Why?  No, because she wants to...  T-Rock, what's going on over there?  No, me and her porn film.  I'm a radio host. 
[03:11:00]  Stripping?  Yeah.  And that porn film, I'm a radio host.  Yeah.  Jesus.  I'm a radio host.  Saturday.  Porn film called Saturday Night.  She says this is called Saturday Night Virus.  Yeah, yeah.  What?  That's good.  Holy shit.  Holy shit, guys.  Wow.  There's Brie Olsen on the screen for you there, Bobo.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Jesus Christ.  Yeah.  Ew.  What the fuck? 
[03:11:30]  It's too late.  She said, oh, no.  I think that thing needs a new gasket.  No, Bobo.  No.  She said, oh, no.  Bobo.  Bobo.  She said, oh, no.  No, it's Bobo.  Bobo.  It's like spaghetti.  It won't break.  Look at it.  I don't know what it is.  I know.  I saw it, dude.  It's going to keep going.  You don't have to magnify it.  I get it.  I get it. 
[03:12:00]  Z-Rong's putting the camera in everybody's face to show the picture.  Yeah, it's right in front of me, dude.  I have it live.  We don't need to see it close up like that.  Oh, my God.  Look at it.  All sorts of shit is going on.  She is saying that she won't stop.  She won't stop.  I won't stop.  I won't stop.  What would happen if you touched it, Bobo?  Yeah, what would happen?  What would happen right now if you just grabbed it and squeezed?  Squeeze it.  What would happen?  What would happen?  I don't know.  I want to save it for the big...  What would happen, though? 
[03:12:30]  It would just squeeze right out.  There's two now, guys.  What?  There's two strings.  Don't let it cross.  You know what happens when they cross.  Oh, my God.  There it is.  Bingo.  It dropped.  It dropped, boys.  Wow.  There's the second string.  It's going on.  Oh, my God.  It's unbelievable.  He hasn't touched himself.  Oh, Bobo.  Look at that video.  Bobo.  There you go.  That's video.  Right?  That's what it would look like.  Bobo, that's what it would look like. 
[03:13:00]  Oh, yeah.  That's what she'd look like.  She just wants it.  She wants it.  She wants it.  Come on.  She wants it.  She wants it.  She wants it.  She wants it.  She wants it.  She wants it.  She won't stop.  She'll get enough.  What are you singing?  Michael Jackson songs?  Well, it's probably one of the best disco songs of the 70s.  All right.  Wow.  So she wants it.  Yes, she wants it. 
[03:13:30]  She wants it.  She's saying, you know, you want, you know, you know, I want it.  Someone wants something.  I want, I want my eyes removed from my head.  And a lobotomy.  Do they make lobotomies that can only wipe out the past half hour or 40 minutes of your memory?  I think now we have the guard down underneath Bobo.  Bobo, you all right?  I'm all right.  Oh, good.  You're doing it.  You're really, you're really doing it. 
[03:14:00]  Bobo, what happens if you just grab it and squeeze?  Problem?  Just the tip a little bit, Bobo.  Big problem?  Grab it, squeeze it, and yell at it.  Think of Christine.  Think of Christine.  Think of her.  Think of her.  Think of her naked.  I want to see if you get out.  Think of those tits.  I want to see if you get out.  I hope it fucking launches all over Bobo.  Just destroys your camera.  I'm sorry, sir.  This has been cummed upon. 
[03:14:30]  Someone fucking mad at New Hampshire, writes, get a can of air and blow a blast on it.  That's all it would take.  E-Roc, can you blow on it?  Oh, you crazy.  Are you out of your mind?  What?  Just one?  Us?  If someone blew on it, would that be it?  I would need a chick to do that.  No, we're not touching it enough.  Yeah, we're not going to touch it.  I would need a hot chick to do that.  Yeah, a hot chick.  All right, close your eyes.  We got a hot chick.  I'll blow on it.  All right, Bobby Lee will blow on it.  All right?  Just look at me like, I'm Lucy Liu. 
[03:15:00]  I'm Lucy Liu, dude.  You want him to put a wig on?  Bobby's not going to touch it.  I can't get close, though.  I can't get close.  No, no, you can't.  No, no, no, no.  How far do I do it?  Holy shit.  Now Danny's trying to get me.  Yeah, it's hot.  Bobby Lee is blowing on it.  Oh, my God.  And then runs away.  It's like lighting a firecracker.  He's trying to light a firecracker.  He blows from like four feet away and then runs away.  What the fuck is going on? 
[03:15:30]  You're almost there, Bobby.  He's saying he needs a napkin.  One more.  Oh, baby.  Oh, baby.  If that gets on my face, you're dead.  Baby, baby.  Holy shit.  Oh, look at the video, Bobo.  I can't do it again.  I can't do it again.  All right.  No.  Oh, Bobby.  That's fucking funny as shit.  Bobby Lee's going to be at Caroline's.  And he's going to do a great job at Caroline's.  Yes.  Tonight through the weekend, Bobby Lee? 
[03:16:00]  Get Christina in here.  Get her in here.  Yeah, okay.  She's going to leave her job to blow you.  Would you want...  Look at the video, Bobo.  Would you want that?  Oh, yeah.

Yeah.  And you're a teacher, right?  Role play?  You're the teacher. 
[03:16:30]  She's dressed like a schoolgirl.  She's dressed like a schoolgirl.  People are begging that we go back to political talk, by the way.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  You want us to discuss the health care thing.  Holy shit.  What about that, Bobo, right?  Oh, yeah.  It's nice.  I'm licking my cock.  I'm licking my cock.  She's licking it.  She's licking it.  I'll be blowing on it and then running away.  I would like to see how much I could catch in a Starbucks cup.  Oh, watch this.  Yeah, yeah.  Get me a cup.  Watch this.  Watch this.  Watch this.  Wait, get him a cup. 
[03:17:00]  This is what it would be like.  Watch this.  Get me a cup.  Get him a cup.  Yeah, get a cup.  Get him a cup.  Get him a cup.  Whatever that means.  Get him a cup.  Get him a full cup of coffee and throw it off.  Why do you need a cup there, Bobo?  I want to see how much I can catch in a cup.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  How much I can catch in there?  Why are you saving it for later?  Yeah, what are you doing?  Are you just going to stand there with a cup under it?  Get in there.  It's like he's getting maple syrup from a tree. 
[03:17:30]  He's got a cup under it.  Oh, my arm.  Danny finds some of the greatest videos of all time.  Leah Love is fantastic.  People are calling Bobby Leah Trooper.  What's the name of this chick?  This is Leah Love.  Leah Love.  Let me show you Anastasia Blue.  Yeah, you want to check out Leah Love?  Oh, yeah, she's a nice one.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  That one, too.  Oh, she.  I want her to show Christina some tricks. 
[03:18:00]  Yeah?  Juggling?  No, I'm talking about some porn.  How to do it like a porn star.  Yeah.  How about you just have Christina do it her way?  And make a dick bigger?  Well, I'd like to see her release her inner porn star.  Oh, her inner porn star.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Yeah, you think she's got an inner porn star there somewhere?  I'd like her to show me how to release my inner porn star.  I'd like Leah Love to show me something.  Show me how to release an inner porn star.  Show me how to do it.  Holy mackerel.  Show me how to do it. 
[03:18:30]  Show me what I need.  Show me how.  Come on.  Wow.  Show me.  Oh, my God.  You're kidding me.  I can't believe this.  I always have something for you, Bobby.  I know.  It's always something.  It's always something.  There's nothing wrong with that, right?  It's a great love.  I love it.  Show me.  I wish she could be in here and show me what she'd say.  I'm talking about her talking like she's doing it with me.  She's talking to himself.  It's unbelievable.  I'd like to hear her talking like she's doing it. 
[03:19:00]  Yeah.  What would she be saying?  I don't know what she could say, but I want her to come up with her own lines.  Yeah, but what would it sound like?  What would it sound like?  Oh, I want it to sound really good.  Do an imitation.  I can't do it.  She says, oh, Bobo.  Bobo.  She would call you Bobo.  She wouldn't call you a...  Right. 
[03:19:30]  Well, you know.  I like her to scream, Danny, so loud.  Oh, Daniel.  Yeah.  Daniel.  Yeah.  Daniel.  I heard Daniel Mates very powerful.  I heard it's a very strong name.  I heard it's a very strong first name.  I heard it's a very strong first name.  Why are you pointing it to me, man?  No, no, no.  Oh, yeah.  Don't point it toward me.  I'd want to see what that name really is all about.  Oh, God.  Oh, my God.  It's a monster.  I want to see what it's all about.  Oh, Christ.  I want to see what your first name's all about. 
[03:20:00]  Show me what it's all about.  Show me what it means.  I want to see if it really means powerful.  Powerful.  Powerful.  Show me.  Come on.  Come on.  I could join.  I could join.  Bob.  I could join.  No.  You're going to get those pills until they get bigger.  Bobo.  Until I'm happy.  Someone wrote, Bobo's prostate is pumping like a sprinter's heart. 
[03:20:30]  Holy shit.  Pete from Jersey.  Like a sprinter.  No.  Actually, it's from Queens.  I'm from Queens.  I'm from Queens, guys.  Whatever, dude.  Whatever.  Holy shit.  Is that funny?  All right.  Let it be known is in the cup.  Yeah, it's in the cup.  I think it's cauliflower penis.  Russell's get it on their ears.  Yeah, yeah.  It fought in the UFC for a while.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  No, it's Hiroshima A-bomb. 
[03:21:00]  Whoa.  All those bumps are for her pleasure.  Yes.  Bobo, what would she be saying?  Oh, I don't want her screaming hard.  Yeah?  Screaming.  Like what?  I want her to see.  She wants, she keeps making me go again and again.  Again and again?  She wants me to wake up, she wants my dick to wake up sore.  Daddy, Daddy loves this part.  Daddy.  Oh, come on. 
[03:21:30]  I want to spit on it.  Should I spit on it?  Yeah.  No.  Are you out of your mind?  Let me spit on it.  Are you out of your mind?  Are you out of your mind?  Ready?  Here we go.  Here we go.  Are you out of your mind?  Oh, great.  That is...  I need a napkin.  Get me a napkin. 
[03:22:00]  I only spit on it.  Holy shit.  Get her a napkin.  It's fine.  It's fine.  Holy shit.  Bobby, blow on it one more time.  One more.  I can't do this deal, man.  I cannot fucking deal.  Bobby is protecting himself with its share.  Holy shit.  All right, Caroline's.  Caroline's.  Bobby, it's weekend.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Sorry about that, Bobo. 
[03:22:30]  It feels good, though, doesn't it?  Uh-oh.  Okay.  Uh-oh.  Time to pull up.  All right.  All right.  There you go.  I got to remove it.  Bobo, boss is coming.  Pull up your pants.  Pull up your pants.  Pull up your pants.  Bobo, the boss is coming.  Pull up your pants.  Bobo, quick.  Quick, boss is coming.  Bobo, now.  Quick, quick.  There's going to be trouble.  So, Ant, Obama had a press conference last night about this health care.  He's under a lot of pressure. 
[03:23:00]  He really is.  Did you see the...  Now, the Republicans' stance on the whole thing, Obama's saying that they want him to  fail.  Absolutely.  And Obama's saying it's not about him.  It's about helping the public.  The less fortunate.  I don't believe it, though, to tell you the truth.  I think it's going to cost a lot of money.  Nothing to say here, mate.  What's up?  So, we do have...  Yeah.  Okay, he's gone.  That was close.  What's going on? 
[03:23:30]  I got started sweating for some reason.  Yeah.  That spitting was the funniest fucking thing I've ever seen.  Someone needs to say it.  No homo.  No homo.  That was hysterical.  Oh, that spitting...  That pitting caused it to go down.  I'm sorry.  Oh.  What about the blowing?  The blowing was good, though, right?  No.  It was all right, right?  No, no, no, no.  That would have had to have been her for me to even gone.  Right.  Yeah, we understand.  It would have been her.  Bobby, you can come by tomorrow. 
[03:24:00]  We can talk about, like, real shit.  All right.  Thank you, guys, for having me.  Caroline?  Yeah, absolutely.  This weekend?  Yeah, because we're wrapping up now.  All right.  Yeah, how do you top that?  Bye, guys.  No, you can keep your headphones on.  I'm just saying.  I'm just acknowledging you're in the room.  Well, I don't know.  I don't...  You're in the room.  Yeah.  God damn, Danny.  The hell did you find there?  Oh, that's that ass cheek video.  Bobo, you all right?  Yeah.  You all right there, Bobo?  I'm all right.  Are you mad at me?  No.  Are you just tired?  Yeah, I just can't feel my legs, damn it. 
[03:24:30]  He looks exhausted.  I can't feel my legs, damn it.  Take a nap, Bobo.  I don't think so.  So that would be a funny bit of me falling asleep at the studio.  That's a funny bit, all right.  Yeah, that's really funny.  Yeah, that's a good topper.  Well, thanks for having me on, guys.  Well, it was wonderful.  It's fantastic.  That'd be hilarious.  A drunken Eastside day waking me up.  Yeah, that'd be unbelievable.  I'm sure Ronnie would appreciate that. 
[03:25:00]  Did you just lay there until Ronnie comes in?  I think he's like, they're probably a smaller.  Smaller dick than you?  Well, I don't know, but somehow he managed to get his wife pregnant twice.  Yeah, so you know what that means.  They're saying the no homo was too late.  Too late, Opster.  You've got a man spitting on another man's cock.  But that's not gay.  Is that gay?  Is that gay?  That's fine.  How many cocks did we all spit on in our lives?  It's almost like I hated it.  It wasn't a sexual.  It was like, I hate you.  I didn't like to fall asleep, but then wake up and then noticing I'm halfway into the run at Fez. 
[03:25:30]  It looks like he has low blood sugar right now.  I have no idea who the heck will wake me up.  You all right?  I'd want it to be random.  And me try to guess who wakes me up.  I'm talking about being blind.  So what do you want?  You want guys to just put ball bags in your face and you guess which ball bag it is?  No, no.  All right, we can get that done.  No, don't do that.  I'll make sure Ron and Fez know.  No, don't do that.  Yeah.  I wouldn't fall asleep then, ever.  Yeah, we'll do that.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Whoa, whoa, whoa. 
[03:26:00]  All right, so Bobby leaves at Caroline starting tonight.  He's going to come back tomorrow.  We're going to talk real shit.  And I think we're done, Ant.  Yeah, I think we are.  Wow, that's a good picture.  Bobby's going for the exit.  He's going for the quick exit.  What did I have to get operated on?  That's my cock talking.  What did I have to get operated on?  What did I have to have urinary problems?  Damn it.  I wanted to be bigger.  I wanted to be 10 and... 
[03:26:30]  Oh.  I wanted to make the Iron Sheik jealous.  Anthony, Jimmy's at the punchline in Atlanta starting tonight.  I wanted to make...  I know there's a 10 o'clock show tonight and then regular shows, I believe, Friday and Saturday.  So we'll leave with Jimmy's fishing a little bit that the boys put together.  I like that.  We'll see you guys tomorrow.  Thanks, Bobo.  Later, man. </pre>
