<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a chaotic scene involving hosts Opie and Anthony, and in-studio guests Rich Voss, Bob Kelly, and Colin Quinn.  A humorous, yet contentious, argument erupted over seating arrangements, quickly escalating into a barrage of insults primarily targeting Voss.  Accusations of Voss stealing Colin Quinn's comedic persona ("Christian Voss") dominated the early part of the show, fueled by perceived imitations on Twitter.  Voss vehemently denied these accusations, intensifying the verbal sparring.  The conversation meandered through various topics including golf, Voss's perceived lack of success, the group's past triumphs and subsequent decline, Colin Quinn's Broadway success, and a continuous stream of personal attacks.  Offensive racial slurs and ethnic remarks were made, often directed at Voss, alongside jokes about physical appearance and sexuality.  A discussion about Voss's house fire was also included.

The tone shifted significantly when the group announced that comedian Patrice O'Neal had suffered a stroke.  They expressed concern and provided a contact email address, loveforpatrice@gmail.com, for well-wishers to send messages to his family.  Keith Robinson joined the group later in the broadcast.  This serious announcement was interwoven with continued banter, personal attacks, and jokes about physical appearance, all while expressing genuine concern for O'Neal.  The discussion regarding O'Neal's health and the email address for well wishes became a recurring theme throughout the rest of the show.  The conversation frequently veered off into tangential discussions, including Halloween traditions in New York City, a crime in Peoria, Illinois, a particularly bad stand-up performance,  and a running joke comparing someone to a jack-o'-lantern.  Repeated jokes about Bob Kelly's eating habits and a recurring misunderstanding about a "Kid Chris Christmas" event were also present.

Further segments included recollections of a poorly received "dildo act" on a treadmill from a past stand-up performance.  Voss's behavior, including massaging his legs and fidgeting, became a source of mockery, as did his handling of a banana.  The insults continued, targeting physical appearances of various guests, including Voss’s hands and Norton’s chin.  The show also promoted a benefit for Mike DiStefano, providing details on date, location, and ticket purchase.  Discussions regarding comedy websites covering O'Neal's situation were also featured.  A phone call with Colin Quinn detailing a recent encounter with Jerry Seinfeld further highlighted the camaraderie, and insults, among the comedians.  The show also included discussion of  Jim Norton’s chin, and various sartorial choices of others.  Jim Jefferies was mentioned as number 61 on Google Trends.  The discussion of Jerry Seinfeld's perceived arrogance included anecdotes from Bob Kelly (who sent Seinfeld a handkerchief) and Jim Jefferies (who recounted a brief interaction at a comedy festival).  Jay Moore, another comedian, called in and performed impressions of Colin Quinn and Jim Norton.  Bob Kelly’s upcoming Comedy Central special and CD release were also promoted.  The broadcast concluded with further discussion of O'Neal's health and plans for future shows, maintaining the aggressive and offensive comedic style throughout.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Morning, everyone.  Morning, morning, morning.  Oh.  We got a full house.  Kelly gets the couch. Jesus Christ.  What? It's a couch sitting on a couch.  What happened?  Put his mic on.  What happened? The door opened and you guys were fighting.  He's running for his stupid favorite chair.  He wants to be part of this show so bad.  No, I don't.  He's so bad. He's in before 8.  I've got to be there at 6.  This might be the day, Bonnie. No, it's not. 
[00:00:30]  Why can't you be this funny on Twitter?  Because I'm not funny on Twitter.  I'm just not.  Neither are you.  I'm going golfing today. Any suggestions?  Hey, I'm Christian Voss today.  Jesus.  Shut up.  You don't like Voss' golf?  Huh?  You don't like his athleticism?  He's relying on it a little too much.  I had a birdie.  Oh, God.  Who cares?  No one cares about golf. 
[00:01:00]  I think I saw an alligator in the pond.  Take his side if you can get to it.  It's the dark side.  All I know is the door opened and you guys were fighting for the big chair.  I wasn't fighting.  We heard that Voss got here early because he wanted a good seat.  Is that what you heard?  Yeah, that's what a few people told us.  Is that what one of your snitches said?  That's not what I got here early.  A few people told me that, Rich.  A few people said, I got here early because I want a good seat.  No, I didn't say that.  I got here early to beat the traffic.  But I said, since I'm here early, I want a good seat.  It's a good line.  Relax. 
[00:01:30]  Jesus Christ.  I couldn't be any more relaxed.  I kind of fucking hate you guys.  I kind of like the line.  I hate everything about this now.  It really is.  It's just awful, right?  Everything about this.  I got to agree with you.  I've never looked up and said, hey, this is a positive thing that's going to happen from  this fucking horrible.  He's right.  It's just awful.  We've been all waiting for something to happen through this and nothing is happening.  Okay, maybe.  We're all just doing the same shit 10 years later.  Maybe 15 fucking mutants will come out and see me. 
[00:02:00]  Don't look me in the face.  Right.  They just have no self-esteem.  I think we all expected when we all got together that all our careers would explode.  Stop.  Stop.  We're just sitting in mediocrity.  Along with the three other people that come in, Voss.  That's not bad.  You guys, look, we were almost there if you two didn't fuck it up.  I blame you, fuckheads.  You were in 38 fucking cities across the country.  You were selling out fucking arenas.  We were doing shows, making thousands, having a blast.  And dick shit and dick shit, too, had to fuck it up. 
[00:02:30]  So, how'd we fuck it up?  How'd you guys fuck it up?  How'd we fuck it up, Bob Kelly?  Tough crowds asking how they fuck it up?  We were dicking a fucking asshole in a church.  No, we did good after that.  We did even better after that.  It was a fucking downwards, it was a slow spiral, but it was a spiral downwards.  We sold out the fucking outdoor venues after that.  Yeah, but it was going downhill.  Comment, Colin?  Yeah, I know, speaking of fucking up.  Let the elder statesman talk, please. 
[00:03:00]  Colin's had a successful off-Broadway show.  And Broadway show, and Broadway show, and...  Yeah, it's on Broadway.  I understand.  Can we stop?  Can we have...  Can we get this fucking animal to stop eating porridge on the fucking radio show?  Stop it.  We don't like hearing you talk with your regular mouth.  Wow, boss.  You got some sleep last night, I'd say.  Yeah.  Last week, Keith brought up a good point, which is a lot of people on Twitter are accusing  Voss of trying to steal my character. 
[00:03:30]  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  And here's the thing.  And then he did it.  He's been trying to do all these new characters, but instead of just being organically into it,  he has to name them.  No!  I don't know.  Yeah.  How many you got now?  For a day.  Body's sitting home with bile in her system every time she looks.  You don't think she's enjoying his...  How many you got now, Rich?  Alternative Voss.  Alternative Voss.  Christian Voss.  I dropped Christian Voss.  You dropped Christian Voss?  No, you were beaten out of Christian Voss. 
[00:04:00]  You didn't drop it.  I dropped Christian Voss.  Because he was accused of...  Christian Voss is so obviously one thing that Colin was doing.  Shut up.  You were ashamed.  I don't beat everybody.  What was Colin doing that was Christian?  Colin was giving, like, kind of Christian-y advice and just...  But he didn't say Christian Voss.  Because he's smarter than you.  I don't have to.  Because he's funnier than you.  It's subtle.  It's organic.  He doesn't have to hammer them over the head, you fucking dudes are talking.  You can figure it out yourself because there's an intelligent person putting it in the  fourth. 
[00:04:30]  First of all, I don't read everybody's posts.  We all knew this would turn into just beating the shit out of Voss.  I knew it.  I knew it.  First of all, once they said, Colin's doing it, I stopped doing Christian comic.  How did you not know that, though?  I haven't done it.  No, listen.  Only when Keith started slamming him in front of all of us.  Keith called you a thief.  You can't...  Hold on, hold on.  Bobby's talking.  You can't be Voss the whole time and then start doing characters three years into Twitter,  you fucking ass.  First of all, I stay stinky on Twitter. 
[00:05:00]  At least I stay...  It's called reinventing yourself.  I wish you did it 30 years ago.  Yeah, I'm taller.  With bigger hands.  I want to move Bobby up to the table.  Don't we have another big chair?  I mean, we can slide him in, because it's weird.  A really, really big chair.  But here's the problem.  Now Keith is going to be on the only couch.  Put the nigga on the couch, motherfucker. 
[00:05:30]  Well, why is he late?  Well, we know why he's late.  Of course, exactly.  Because those people tend to be late.  Why can't we teach him a lesson?  Huh?  Because it might be my fault for saying it's up to 6.30.  Can we have a...  We'll squeeze him somewhere else.  Pour in my coffee, because the intern got two out of three things wrong.  Is that better, Bobby?  Yeah, he's got two out of three things wrong.  Is that better?  Yeah, that's good.  All right.  You told him 6.30?  Yeah, I wasn't sure.  Oh, way to take care of your fly fishing fucking buddy.  Oh, man, really?  Hey, why don't you shut your face, thin fingers? 
[00:06:00]  Two game blades up there fly fishing together in fucking Binghamton.  Not you.  Oh, Pam.  You guys are out there like you.  We all have thin fingers, because there's not one fucking man in this room.  You know what?  The last time you had a fucking nail banger over there.  Thin fingers was 12 years ago.  The fat thong fucking kumia.  That's it.  Hey, this is from swinging a hammerhead in my life.  Fucking HVAC.  Yeah.  He's got fucking eye.  I can open any jar kumia.  Let me get that five-gallon drum for you.  Fuck it.  Yeah.  Jesus Christ. 
[00:06:30]  I work for a living.  You should.  You got soft hands, Mr. Hooper, for meeting heroes all your life.  He said, you know, I work for a living.  He goes, you should.  That's a good one.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  God damn.  Keith Robertson.  I'm early, man.  I'm key.  Oh, this is a black record.  People are very confused while everyone's here.  A black record.  We'll explain in a few minutes.  Oh, shit.  Can we just look around the room and look at all the fat hoodies that are in this room right now?  What's going on there? 
[00:07:00]  Holy shit.  It's called a big cover-up.  Yeah, it's a cover-up.  Your boss is wearing a fat hoodies.  Stylish denim.  Yours is a not hoodie.  Yours is a tent.  Say it again?  Oh, that was just hurtful.  Nothing.  Emphasize tent.  No laughter at all.  Oh, boy.  Damn.  Just hurtful on that one.  That was hurtful.  Yeah, I mean, you know, usually there's a chuckle involved.  The boss is in stylish denim, though, today.  Denim.  Denim wasn't stylish.  Fucking Matt Damon's career.  That was last time fucking...  All right.  Nice talking to you.  Well, I got a little ahead of myself on that one. 
[00:07:30]  Woo!  I was on the skateboard.  Boss is dressed like Blake Lively.  Blake Lively?  Maybe you could call your new character that on Twitter.  Thief.  Crazy denim guy.  I've got to go back to tweeting about golf.  Now that he's going to save me.  There's a double for me.  I love the Dwight.  I backed off of Twitter, man.  I was just...  I was getting infuriated every fucking night.  I just reached it and realized I spent three, four hours just yelling at people that I could give a shit about. 
[00:08:00]  Like, what am I doing?  When you could be helping your girlfriend with her homework.  It was in case the Anthony stuff was fun.  That was fun.  Just...  Ah, shit, Anthony.  Ah, shit, Rich.  That was a good one.  What happened?  He said, when you could be helping your girlfriend with homework.  I love when you banned me from the O&A show.  I know.  I banned him on Twitter.  People were shocked.  That was a powerful performance. 
[00:08:30]  When you showed up.  Well, then people were writing me, what's up with Anthony and Colin?  I'm like, seriously?  It was people were accusing us of doing the same fucking Twitter shtick.  I was just doing the Casey Anthony thing.  Yeah.  It was fun.  You get housewives from Orlando during that trial who are like mothers.  You search for them.  I can find them.  And then you change their tweet that is bashing Casey Anthony to make it sound like they loved Casey Anthony.  You retweet it and agree with them.  Oh, were they angry.  It's like mail fraud.  It is.  I know. 
[00:09:00]  I get scared to do that.  You could totally change someone's fucking tweet.  This bitch now said it.  And I got more followers, so that's what she said.  Her whole cul-de-sac hates her now.  Oh, yeah.  I thought you were against this mother-killing, murdering thing.  You can't be part of the potluck dinner this weekend.  It was fun.  And, you know, I have a little fun with the Occupy thing, but that kind of makes fun of itself.  Fucking Oakland knows how to fucking Occupy.  They're throwing rocks at the cops, fucking Molotov cocktails, M-80s and M-1000s. 
[00:09:30]  Are you kidding me?  All those young hippie kids in Oakland are throwing all the peace-loving things.  What are you saying?  What are you saying?  Really amazing.  Oh, shit.  That was a black day.  We know how to Occupy, baby.  No shit, man.  You also know how to freeload and soak everything out of the government.  Jesus.  Oh, wow.  That's right.  Rich, man.  Rich, man.  Rich just going real.  No jokes involved at all.  You were part of it.  You were part of the problem, Vols. 
[00:10:00]  Oh, here comes the black against the Jew thing.  That's right.  No, black on black.  Vols is black.  That's how Plainville.  Pretty much.  He doesn't Roman motherfucker.  If you look at his resume, he's black.  He don't have a resume.  He really is black.  He's just like a winner.  I'm sorry.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Vols don't have a resume.  He has a tight dungaree jacket.  Don't have a house, either.  How's that going?  Oh, wow. 
[00:10:30]  All right, good.  Jesus.  I like that.  Vols lives in Section 8 housing now.  Oh, dear.  His block looks like Baltimore now.  I have a look at the train.  The neighbors are like, I knew it.  I knew it was.  The minute he moved in, I knew this was going to be real.  He'd be the problem.  Oh, shit.  Fuck.  Enriched now with nothing to say.  What did happen to that house?  How did it burn down?  Electrical.  Fire.  Wait, electrical?  I don't fucking know.  Well, the money in his mattress started burning.  Bonnie did something. 
[00:11:00]  We all know that.  We're just trying to figure out what it is.  Oh, because she had a subconscious.  She's like, I got to fucking burn down my life.  She threw a match on the rug and dozed off.  They found half a pack of Newports under the balcony.  It's implying she was having sex with a black man.  A black girl.  A black man's more cool.  That was in the 70s, I'm a ball.  The 70s reference?  Oh, shit.  Jesus. 
[00:11:30]  Fuck.  Boss got some boxing gloves on.  Stop eating no mail.  Why?  Well, you should start.  Because you never know when you're going to save this little cocksuck.  By the way, did anybody see Boss' hand after he delivered that one?  He actually did the fucking throw.  Oh, like Gleason?  He throws fast.  He throws fast.  Throw my dice with a cigarette.  Hey, I throw my hand.  Boss had to fix his diet.  No risk.  Give me some milk.  He's holding it under Bob's breast. 
[00:12:00]  That was uncalled for.  I thought Boss ate oats, not oatmeal.  Oh, who's back?  Colin's stepping in from remote control.  And then he just gets a little sip of coffee.  Like, yeah, my mission's done there.  I don't like the fact that Boss just tried to trash me.  He goes, stepping in from remote control.  You don't like it?  No, that was a little wrong.  That was a while ago.  Yeah, that is kind of.  He's proved himself so fast.  That's just mean.  He had like a 15-year lull, but he's doing good. 
[00:12:30]  15.  Oh, it's so true.  Colin's like Sade.  Every 15 years, something clicks for him.  The fans here don't know who Sade is.  Why would you just, why?  Yeah, that's true.  Sade.  Because Boss is trying to keep a focus group thing going.  I said Sade.  Sade.  Sade.  Sade.  What, did you just roll out of bed?  One of my view for a view.  It was all that stupid.  No, you're fat.  That's what I mean. 
[00:13:00]  Your wife rolled you out of bed.  Then he rolled out of his house.  Then he rolled into the building.  I know, at the Starbucks and got a roll.  Oh, jeez.  No, fool.  Put a stop to your shit.  What did you have for breakfast?  John Panette?  I don't know how he pulled that one off.  You wrote that last night.  Come on, be honest.  You wrote that last night.  I meant the word Panette.  It was fucking it.  He was P's and T's.  I was game with prepared material, obviously. 
[00:13:30]  Look at him.  He's pulling out a Panette.  I feel mad though.  He's surrounding it.  But none of his jokes are like, what is it?  Like, that's the 90s?  The best part of it, this is only 627.  Yeah.  Yeah, I know.  There's been like 80 good slams.  It's a lot per minute.  There you go.  Oh, there's milk.  By the way, for those of you.  You listening that can't see voices, stop eating oatmeal.  That's just how he sounds.  I was trying to say.  That's what I was trying to get out of there. 
[00:14:00]  You got me first.  It just can't happen any other way.  No, it can't.  I know.  It just can't ever be.  I thought the over-under would be 30 minutes.  I know.  We were talking like, it's got to be maybe 30 minutes, 40 minutes before it gets vicious.  I knew.  I knew right off the bat it would be like this.  By the time Keith showed up.  Who said 7?  See, I'm playing.  He'd be late.  I was here on time.  Yeah.  Keith looks like a quiet storm DJ. 
[00:14:30]  Nothing.  No, no, no.  Let's know what that means.  What does that mean?  What does that mean?  Let's not know what it means.  It's from the Texaco Star Theater.  Yeah, what is that?  Every black radio station has a slow jam portion.  All right, you fucking savant.  I figured it was the radio.  I'd be an inside radio thing and everybody would get a nice laugh.  No.  These guys aren't in red.  What the fuck do we know?  I know.  What do we know?  I was just going to say.  What do we know about radio?  We've never been in radio in seven years.  This is a hyped up podcast.  It's just supercharged. 
[00:15:00]  All right.  Shit, maybe I should give you a number out, you fucking cunt.  Dude, I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I fucking up.  I'm sorry.  Bobby gave out Anthony's number on his podcast.  And fucking Anthony got like, what, two calls?  One from Bobby apologizing.  My phone did it.  I didn't do it.  Yeah.  You don't listen to your podcast?  No.  Who?  He's giving it out.  You're a machine.  He goes, let me call Anthony.  He starts dialing and he doesn't hear the number you have reached. 
[00:15:30]  Nine, one, seven.  And he just starts giving out my number.  And he doesn't pull the plug or anything.  I pulled every plug.  Did you?  You start panicking?  The kid goes, you know you're giving out Anthony's number.  I pulled literally every plug and I threw my computer on the ground.  Just unplug the goddamn thing.  I pulled everything.  I just threw it on the ground and stared at it for like 10 seconds.  I fucked up.  Yeah.  What are you going to do?  Who doesn't leave the fucking hate?  It's Anthony.  I'm not here.  I was getting a new Verizon phone with a new number anyway. 
[00:16:00]  I apologize for you.  Oh, shit.  Come on now.  Herman King.  Herman King.  That is a sporty fedora, man.  There's your leader.  That guy's awful.  Come on.  No, he's leading the fucking GOP.  Yeah, I like him.  He's fucking anti-abortion.  He's a little crazy.  With that abortion thing.  Yeah.  I need abortions.  Do you need abortions?  I wish you had one.  You knew if I was one. 
[00:16:30]  It almost worked.  Why did they get that many white people in Oakland?  Other than Oakland?  That was Oakland at the bottom.  Yeah, the Oakland one is leading the pack.  Yeah, they went right to violence.  I think they had about 80 arrests.  New York's a boring occupier.  That's what you need to really have a protest.  Yeah, you can't just sit there and play drums like that in a fucking park that they're allowing you in.  He thinks someone's calling him.  Oh, Jesus.  God damn, Rich, man.  Jesus.  Can't go two seconds. 
[00:17:00]  I'm enjoying it.  He really is.  He's so happy with that one.  He's got his new teeth.  He's changed.  He just goes back to jungle jokes.  That is the antithesis of racism right there.  We've moved on.  What would Christian Voss say?  Christian Voss.  With a little trademark at the end of it, like it's all his.  Don't take this. 
[00:17:30]  It's totally fucking Colin's bid.  Okay, I did it one day when I found out.  I dropped it.  No, you didn't.  I did.  You fought the whole time.  I fought.  You switched it to a fucking alternative comic Voss.  No, I was doing that before.  No, you weren't.  You never was doing alternative comic Voss.  I was doing it before, Christian.  I was.  I was.  No, you were just tweeting before that.  Why don't you do it for the North Voss?  That works best for you.  He's actually called around being a thief, and he goes, well, we can both do it.  Like you tried to make it.  You really are black. 
[00:18:00]  He did the classic thief line.  I was doing it five years ago.  Yeah.  Before Twitter started, you said shit.  Everyone knows Colin does that.  Okay.  I didn't know.  I'm sorry.  I fucking stopped doing it.  I'll do it.  I'm sorry you got caught.  Now you're lying again.  You're a thief and a liar.  You finally found a way out of getting your feelings hurt on Twitter by being fucking  someone else.  That's what. 
[00:18:30]  No, but he's right.  So that's why when they trash you, they're not trashing you.  They're trashing Christian comic Voss.  You know, that's what he did.  He's got a way to separate himself from the mission.  He's right.  That's what Colin did.  Please, I get destroyed on Twitter.  We're going live in the clubs.  Here's the thing.  Oh, Jesus.  That wasn't nice.  Sorry, I was in the Newport News this weekend.  Was he in the Newport News?  He calls me out from a hotel parking lot. 
[00:19:00]  Oh, my God.  Do I have like a fucking freaknik party out there?  He's like, I gotta get to my room.  You hear him coming back from two shows on a Saturday night.  You hear the fucking, the sound of the soda machine when he hits it for that fucking.  The hotel was completely empty all week.  But on Friday and Saturday, they have an Afro-American nightclub there.  Afro-American.  You say?  That offends me.  Afro-American.  That fucking year it is.  Are you really fucking annoying?  They don't have afros anymore. 
[00:19:30]  They have dead horse hair now.  Okay.  Wow.  Sorry.  Sorry.  Sorry.  Sorry.  Oh, no, I mean, I saw the documentary that Chris Larkin did.  The thing, the documentary.  Wow, that's good.  Stop saying they don't.  I saw they.  One of them is here.  You fat Mexican.  Stop saying they don't.  Hey, hey, hey, hey.  That's fucking racist.  Voss, you're saying, let's get back to the jury. 
[00:20:00]  Voss is going to adjust this one.  Go ahead.  Now, you were going to say.  Instead of saying Afro-American, you were going to say something else.  Well, whatever you call them now, I don't know.  Jesus.  Oh, boy.  Well, I got it.  I don't know who you're talking to.  There was a lot of Negroes at a nightclub.  Jesus Christ.  What?  Negroes.  Feeling very uncomfortable.  Ask Keith what he wants to be called.  Jesus.  Okay.  What does Wanda call you?  Besides opener. 
[00:20:30]  He goes, he's an opener American.  Oh, my God.  That's pretty good.  I just can start a rule that I have to leave the damn place for.  He's opening doors, too, right?  Thank you.  Thank you, Chip.  Oh, Chip.  Yeah.  Yeah, Chip.  Wonderful.  Ah, shit.  Chip really ruined everything, didn't he?  Yeah, he really did.  Oh, yeah.  It's the first time. 
[00:21:00]  We'll see that again.  No.  Yeah.  Well, these guys are here, obviously.  Yeah.  Keith Robson, Rich Voss, Bob Kelly, and Colin Quinn.  And Jimmy invited them in this morning.  Yeah.  Damn right.  I'm feeling good right now.  Yeah.  That'll last about 30 seconds.  Come on, boss.  What do you got?  You stop looking at me, stupid.  I like your fucking hoodie.  You can't look at anyone any other way but stupid.  Jesus.  It doesn't even seem like you were here up till now. 
[00:21:30]  Really?  Yeah.  Oh.  Hearing's going, too?  Yes.  Ah, Jesus.  Ah, Voss.  You used to be like a hip Lenny Bruce looking guy.  Now you look like a furniture store owner.  On Route 9.  When he had his ponytail, he looked like that. 
[00:22:00]  I remember Voss in his stupid ponytail.  He came to Boston, Knicks, Boston one night.  He showed up on a Saturday.  I'm Rich Voss, but that's with his old teeth, so he scared people.  You had a tank top and your ponytail, all greased back, and I can't believe you asked  me for ID.  Oh, see, you're a door guy.  Oh, see, you're a door guy.  I got it.  Say 50% with my Voss-a-pedic.  The furniture store, they're killing me. 
[00:22:30]  I'm going to sing it on one of those local shitty commercials.  This pillow has drool guard.  An extra-strength nightstand to put your teeth on.  Wow.  Here's the thing, yes.  Here's the thing, yes. 
[00:23:00]  You should get t-shirts made, by the way.  No, here's the thing.  Listeners, see how we do this?  Because we're friends.  Right.  Mike, what are you doing, Voss?  In other words, I'm trying to say, when you guys do it, it's just mean and nasty.  You're basically saying the listeners don't know how to do this.  Mike Cove, but it's a piece of cake.  What is it?  He's taking his pocket.  Bob was sipping around his jacket like a fat dog. 
[00:23:30]  I think you brought that knowing you'd tell that fucking joke.  He's really going to bet again?  Is that all you do is gamble and drink?  And just everything's a party, isn't it?  Look at this job.  Of course.  It has to be.  Oh, your hands are fucking awful.  They're ashy.  Everything about you.  He has to use two hands to eat a little cake.  Voss's hands should be on Norton's body. 
[00:24:00]  Yeah, that's right.  Humble fingers.  Jesus.  How do you cough into those hands?  It's not really helping.  I know.  The germs go right around them.  Body quick.  I'm about to cough.  It's not why they're so small.  God, Keith adds nothing.  That's what you got.  What are you talking about?  What's wrong with you, Rich?  We're all just having fun. 
[00:24:30]  He's uncomfortable.  It's his second time here.  Oh, man.  It's okay.  Are you uncomfortable?  Yeah.  So you're saying quantity is better than quality, Rich?  Exactly.  That's why he does 19 shows on a weekend.  I'm going to be at Vinny's Italian restaurant doing six shows a day.  Okay.  Boo.  Boo.  I haven't heard that fucking button in a long time. 
[00:25:00]  That's the first one in the morning, sir.  Actually, I deserved an authentic boo on that.  Yeah.  That was right.  Boo, you should be getting moo's.  Sip.  Wow.  Then there's the second one.  Back to back into belly to belly.  Thank you, boss.  Yeah.  I said 30 minutes.  I said 30 minutes.  I still think what bothered us was the sip after.  That was kind of annoying.  Yeah, it wasn't?  Yeah.  I think the way you're sitting like you're fucking important.  I'm just tired.  He's slumping.  How are we sitting like he's important?  Yeah. 
[00:25:30]  This is not the way an important person sits.  I'm slumped over on my left.  Fucking Jabba the Hutt.  Perfect reference.  Why are we all up to yourself?  There's plenty of people here, Bobby.  You don't have to talk to yourself.  No.  It's just mean.  It really is.  Sorry.  I can't help it.  Well, this is a weird morning.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Jimmy invited these guys in.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I mean, we have to, you know.  But you know we can't start any other way. 
[00:26:00]  We can't be around each other without just generating it.  It doesn't matter where or where and why.  We just can't.  How could we?  You really don't have to say that since we're in the middle of doing it.  I know that.  Maybe Rich will have a character name for this.  Hold on.  Hold on.  My father-in-law wants to make a speech at a wedding.  You know, guys.  We're all here, family, for this wedding that we just had.  There's a lot of love in this room.  A lot of family.  Oh, shit. 
[00:26:30]  State me obvious, you fucking water moccasin.  That came from the fucking, his gut.  That came from his gut.  You fucking water moccasin.  That guy didn't come from yours.  It'd still be on its way.  You gotta be careful.  This guy's a counter puncher. 
[00:27:00]  This little fucking sock puppet is a counter puncher.  Oh, shit.  Whoa.  Oh, God.  That was tough.  That was a good point.  I couldn't argue.  Yeah.  Fuck it.  Wait till after the break.  I don't know how you guys run this thing.  Yeah, I know.  What break?  Huh?  I know.  There's gotta be food here first.  Yeah.  We could, uh...  There's Kenny.  There's Kenny in my grub.  We're obviously trying to avoid. 
[00:27:30]  Should we just...  Why all you guys are here as well.  Yeah.  I say wait till after the break, Lee Collins.  Like, seriously.  What are you, teasing?  We're not teasing that shit.  Teasing things, Jesus.  I'm gonna be here anyway, so...  Yeah.  I'm gonna be here after the break, right?  I'm running out.  Well, don't you gotta go do Talman's radio show?  Nothing.  Wow.  That could have...  No!  That could have been a...  No, it couldn't have been good.  That could have been a legitimate question.  That was so good.  No, it couldn't have been good.  He stops himself in the middle and goes,  No, it couldn't have been good.  Let me just make sure you know that. 
[00:28:00]  No, it couldn't have been good.  Well, you know, look.  We just...  We gotta...  Yeah.  Who wants to do this?  Look, we're all here, you know,  to kind of, I guess, make a...  To let people know  that one of our really, really good friends  fell ill, fell sick. 
[00:28:30]  Patrice, Patrice O'Neal,  had a stroke.  Not a bit, you dummies, either.  No, we're not...  I didn't hear that.  It's just kind of,  we wanted to do it like,  you know, it was a week ago  and we were trying to...  The family wanted to kind of kept quiet  and we understood why.  So we've known since last Wednesday  and we didn't want to, you know,  out of respect for his mom and his wife, 
[00:29:00]  didn't want to say anything.  But it's getting to a point  where people, comedians are starting to  and it's kind of...  The word's getting out there.  Yeah.  The word's getting out there.  And I think we all wanted it  to kind of come from  us saying it  instead of some  somebody on Twitter  or somebody,  some blogger  or some club owner.  You know, I just...  You want something like this  to come from...  From true scumbags.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah.  Not like club owners.  Real, real scumbags 
[00:29:30]  in this room.  Right.  But we don't know  how he is.  I mean,  you know,  it's too soon to tell  anybody that knows  about Strokes.  I mean,  it takes a while sometimes.  We just don't know.  Yeah.  We don't know  how he's going to be.  And please,  it's tempting,  I know,  to try to reach out  or whatever,  but you got to  let the family  just alone.  Please do.  Yeah,  don't try to find out  where he is  or try...  We know that a lot of people  loved Patrice.  A lot of people...  Yeah.  You know, 
[00:30:00]  even the people  that didn't like him  liked him.  Yeah.  Yeah,  so he,  you know,  just let the...  Don't...  For now,  let the family...  It's a hard time for them,  so don't try to find out  where he is  and don't try to send anything  and there's a...  We have...  An email address.  Do you have an email address?  They set up an email address.  If you want to send out  well-wishings  because he's being transferred anyway,  we just don't know where.  So if you don't start  sending cards and flowers  because it's going to wind up  in a place  that he's not even going to be at.  We have an email address 
[00:30:30]  if you want  and his wife will  either get him access to it  or she'll,  you know,  or she'll read them to him.  It's loveforpatrice  at gmail.com.  So if you want to send  well-wishings and stuff,  I'm sure she'll make sure  that he gets them  or as many of them  as he can.  You know,  there was just no other way  to say it.  You know,  it's like,  how do you give this news to people?  It's awful.  Yeah.  But, you know,  this is not a memorial.  And this is not why 
[00:31:00]  these guys are in here.  It's not like,  oh,  this is to remember them.  It's just to tell you  what's going on.  But I didn't want to do it  by myself.  I don't think any of us  wanted to do it by ourselves.  And we kind of feel  as a group.  No,  that totally makes sense.  You know,  you want everybody  to be a part of it.  Right.  If you know you guys,  this is the way to do it.  Yeah.  And we just,  we don't have any,  we wish we had more news for you,  but we just,  we don't.  It happened last Wednesday.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Anybody else want to say anything?  What can you say?  No,  it's too hard.  I was thinking,  you know, 
[00:31:30]  and like you said,  it's not a memorial.  It's not a memorial,  but I was thinking of the things,  me and Patrice.  I remember one time,  Patrice and I were walking  from the comedy cellar  back to our car.  No,  I'm just,  in the fun time.  It's not a memorial,  but not a memorial.  It's not a memorial.  I remember.  For more memories,  go to Christian Comic  on Twitter.  Okay,  now that we got it  out of the way,  Patrice had a stroke  back to us.  Well,  he was on,  all right,  so you,  let me see where the story is going. 
[00:32:00]  I do want to see where this is going  because it won't be a memorial.  It's going to be a horrid story.  It's a memorial for Boris's career,  but go ahead.  Now,  you're on your way to the car  from the cellar.  And we just had a nice talk.  See?  Oh,  wow.  That's a good one.  No,  that's not what happened,  but what happened?  What do you say?  Jesus,  Rich.  It's so fucking sad.  It's hard for us to talk about it  because he's such a good,  Bonnie married you.  He's such a good friend.  He's such a good friend. 
[00:32:30]  We know him.  It's just,  it's,  it's too hard to fucking talk about,  you know,  on the air and,  you know,  without any answers.  It's devastating.  You know,  it's just,  whatever.  And,  and,  it's just,  it's hard.  So,  what can you say?  What can you say?  We pray  that everything works out.  And deep in my heart,  for real,  I think everything will work out. 
[00:33:00]  I really do.  So,  and,  and,  you know.  That's why you gotta live your life like,  you know,  it's your last day on the planet.  Like you.  That's how I do it.  That's how I do it.  You know,  and we know.  I'm a maniac.  You just started at 58,  though.  I'm 58.  Get out of here.  You guys tack on the years.  Bastards.  Colin,  you got anything,  brother?  Anthony,  Anthony lives his life like Gaddafi.  He was last week.  I hope we end the same.  Jesus.  I'll jump on that. 
[00:33:30]  Exactly.  A bunch of girls' fathers just clubbing him out.  They're dragging a drunken man away from a karaoke machine.  That's every weekend.  Wait a minute.  All right,  Anthony,  you've had enough.  It's coming from Richard Widmark.  No,  wait a minute.  No,  he wasn't a drunk one.  He was just dead on a bloody mattress.  His big hands.  What are you eating?  Oh,  Colin gave me a table.  A table. 
[00:34:00]  Did you say a table?  The table.  And he spills his coffee.  And then he spills his coffee.  Oh,  God.  Well,  I think that,  you know,  I mean,  it sucks that,  you know,  we just wanted people to know.  Yeah.  From all of us.  And through the white channel.  The real,  I mean,  this is,  you're going to hear stuff.  You're going to hear all sorts of shit.  You start hearing,  I started hearing stupid stuff that didn't happen.  And from people that don't know on the West Coast.  And,  you know,  then,  you know,  this is what we know. 
[00:34:30]  That's it.  You know,  so,  you know,  keep the,  if you pray,  pray,  you know,  have positive thoughts for him.  Love him or hate him.  He's one of the funniest guys on the planet Earth.  Yeah.  Yep.  You know,  and he's,  you know,  he's our really good friend.  We all came up together and made our bones together.  And,  you know,  we just wanted to let you guys know,  the fans that,  you know,  he's,  you know,  he needs your prayers and thoughts right now.  And we're doing the same thing.  And,  you know,  send the emails over, 
[00:35:00]  send good emails to his wife.  And if we know stuff,  we'll,  we'll let you know,  but don't,  don't,  don't harp.  And,  you know,  don't,  Hey,  we know you're going to be like,  what happened?  What happened?  What happened?  We,  this is it.  That's it.  So we don't know.  Literally,  you know,  I don't know.  Well,  if it's stroking go,  you don't,  you just don't know about that.  But it's always hope involved and that everything will turn out.  Okay.  So,  you know,  just like you said,  keep praying.  Yeah.  So don't buy into any rumors you hear from people that don't know what the fuck they're talking about or anything like that. 
[00:35:30]  You know,  let's just come from the,  obviously the family and,  you know,  Jimmy and stuff and,  and we'd let you know what's going on.  So yeah,  you can't,  you're going to hear a lot of nonsense and I'm surprised it's been acquired for this.  No kidding.  Yeah.  You can feel it.  Just people,  you know,  some of the calls like Bobby said from the West coast comedians and all the comics are,  you know,  a lot of the comedians know already.  Yeah.  And I respect them for not saying anything stupid or,  you know,  whatever,  but we just wanted to get it out there from people who love them and not again. 
[00:36:00]  A lot of,  a lot of stupid stuff is going to get said though.  I already heard a story,  an idiotic story about trees crossing the street outside the comedy cellar with a comedian.  It was a ham handed tale.  What?  Oh shit.  You didn't even know what you were talking about.  Rich was looking at Kyle like,  Oh really?  What asshole would do this kind of thing right now?  Why is he bringing this off?  This is stupid.  Stop and look at this,  this evil old man who lit the fuse and then just step back and let you animals attack this poor Jew. 
[00:36:30]  And took a sip of his English tea.  Just the English asshole that you are,  you thin fingered Brit.  What'd you do with an English accent?  I want to hear the story about the guy when he worked at,  too long,  too much accent.  You really were enjoying it.  Oh boy.  So that's what I do at my house when I work it out.  Did I get to start working out at your house? 
[00:37:00]  Bobby,  Bobby looks like a hippo in the middle of being born.  Because I have the hoodie on.  That's what I said.  I really did.  You know what?  When you lose weight,  Bobby,  people compliment you.  You should just tell them,  go fuck yourself.  Because I'm going to gain it back.  Because it always turns around.  Because I'm going to gain it back.  I do.  It always turns around.  Maybe if you showed up at one of my shows once,  you'd hear that.  Oh shit. 
[00:37:30]  Oh shit.  I'm sorry.  It just hurts that you don't come.  Do you understand  what it's like to do the Borgata  and have fucking  five empty seats in the middle  that are called  the Anthony chairs?  He doesn't come see me  and he's 15 feet away.  He knows what it's like  to do the Borgata.  The Borgata?  Yeah.  Dane never worked there.  There he did.  Stupid.  Oh sorry.  You stink.  I know.  You really just stink.  Anthony really is like my agents. 
[00:38:00]  Just empty chairs.  You just stink.  Bob looks like a casino bouncer  in Hong Kong.  You look fine.  Did everybody get what they need to eat?  No.  Did you guys get food?  No.  We got nothing.  You shitty host.  You don't see a lamb in Bobby's hand?  What did you say?  What did you say?  It was good, Bobby.  What did you say?  Gray neck? 
[00:38:30]  Oh, wow.  You really do have a lot of gray on your neck  and your fucking beard.  Yeah.  Oh, my hair?  No, still not your ears.  You should have came out that jacket  you're wearing, stupid.  What's that?  Nothing.  Never mind.  You already said Bowser.  I didn't hear the baritone.  I got a radio voice.  I know.  I like it.  I wish I had a radio career  so I wouldn't have to see you at the cellar.  Oh, I have a story about this cellar. 
[00:39:00]  I mean, I really want to know the conclusion.  Could you humor us?  I'm just saying how fun he is.  How fun.  We walked into the bottom of the Boston Comedy Club  like there used to be a bar down there.  That way they keep the mobs.  While you clean up, but forget it.  All right.  And Ben Bailey and DC Benny were there.  Ben Bailey.  And we walked in and we, this was years ago,  and we smashed them so hard.  We smashed them. 
[00:39:30]  Like, and it was just pow, pow.  And we just walked out and got in the car  and drove to Jersey City.  And it was just so much fun.  He smashed Eddie F one night.  I'm just saying how, shut up.  I'm just saying.  Yeah, but you love.  And Keith is right.  Keith's emotion.  He's looking at me like, can.  Can I punch him in the face?  No, but.  Will I get arrested if I punch Voss in the face?  Patrice gets arrested.  Patrice is a brilliantly funny guy,  but it's funny that we're saying like we love him.  There's no doubt about that.  And we just want to tell like slamming stories, 
[00:40:00]  which is kind of understandable.  Yeah.  But I like that story too,  because especially without all the details of the lines,  I think it really enhances it.  Yeah.  Like.  Yeah, we just walked in there.  Oh, and we got him.  No, but he got specific.  He said, pow, pow.  You're like.  You use Batman noises.  He's a children's book.  Yeah, we started slamming him, pal.  Bing.  And then we went right in there.  Oh, man.  And tried to take it.  And then we drove to Jersey City. 
[00:40:30]  Bing, bang.  You guys should see my act on stage.  You don't have to see it, but just it was really funny.  Why was you laughing?  That's all I didn't mean to.  I'm telling you it was funny.  I just go up there, go room, room.  I hate the Jersey City.  It's not mean, but your storytelling ability needs a lot to be desired.  You actually, I'm a comedian, and I didn't get it.  We just went, pow, pow.  Yeah, what were you trying to say?  Nothing.  Fucking. 
[00:41:00]  You get booed by six-year-olds.  Whoops.  He just goes, whoops.  I was looking at Voss's mouth when I tried to say it.  Fuck you up.  Six-year-old group.  Come on, Voss.  Give us another sweet story.  That was terrible.  Well, one time, Keith and I were working at Shane's, a one-nighter.  What?  What?  Nothing. 
[00:41:30]  Shane's?  That's what we were working with.  I was in the back going, why is he headlining?  To Keith.  Why is this horrible guy headlining?  Walt Whitman, isn't he?  What's that?  Nothing.  I was just commenting.  This is where Tough Crowd goes into commercial.  You know they have all Tough Crowd episodes on YouTube now?  Oh yeah, all over the fucking place.  They're all on YouTube now.  Really?  Yeah, they're all on YouTube now. 
[00:42:00]  Colin, are you making any cake off of that?  Oh yeah.  I'm fucking believable.  And it's the shittiest quality you could possibly imagine.  Like content-wise?  Both.  Jimmy, what's the email address again?  Because people don't know how to...  How is it spelled?  Oh, it's L-O-V-E-F-O-R.  Oh, it is F-O-R instead of the number four.  Oh yeah, yeah.  It's funny.  I asked that too when Jonathan told me...  That's not funny.  That is funny.  That's not funny.  I haven't seen any humor in that at all.  Why would you say that's funny?  It kind of...  I meant like it's an odd thing. 
[00:42:30]  I was funny.  You would probably say funny.  You would say...  You could use funny in many different ways.  Let me correct myself.  That was kind of Voss.  Jesus.  L-O-V-E-F-O-R-P-A-T-R-I-C-E at gmail.com.  Stop swinging your little legs.  Yeah, we really don't like your fucking...  Your baby seat feet.  F-O-R, dummies, not the number.  Jesus.  You know, close...  I realize what's going to happen with Bonnie and Voss.  I thought it was going to be like George and Gracie or like Regis and Kelly.  But it's going to be like Jeff Dunham and... 
[00:43:00]  You know.  Fuck.  Yeah.  Oh!  I hate to do this to you.  What happened?  Just lose your train of thought, old man.  What was I saying?  Hey, I was a patient.  Jerry wasn't here to direct that one.  Carl, you got to quit forgetting the punchlines.  Carl.  Stretch.  Like you did at Brokerage.  What, you reading off a teleprompter?  Oh, Jesus. 
[00:43:30]  Still the thing that puts me off the most  one time I made some joke about  remember when I helped Jerry push his car  and then I listened to the show one morning  and Anthony was going,  what happened to Carl?  It's just his car and then  pushing Jerry's car to give him a bump start.  And to this day,  some of those dumb Twitter fans go,  I'm going, hey, what are you going to push Jerry?  He's pushing it.  And Jerry didn't even wave at him.  He just drove off.  He just drove off.  This show really does stink. 
[00:44:00]  It's really just an evil fuck.  It's nothing to do with good.  You heard the car start up  and Colin took two fast paces  and then fell in the mud.  I'm good, Jerry.  I'm good.  It won't Bobby up.  Not one horn beat.  No way.  And you know,  Colin was trying to look in the side view mirror  to maybe see Jerry's eyes  like an acknowledgement.  Nothing.  Nothing.  No wave, no nothing.  He was calling Michael Richards.  Guess what I just treated Colin like? 
[00:44:30]  A starter motor.  Oh, Colin.  Oh, Colin.  Oh, Colin.  It's the fact that he did it.  It's like none of the door guys.  They said, yeah, feed it.  Colin.  With his little thin fingers.  Every muscle in those skinny little legs. 
[00:45:00]  Every muscle.  Okay, my pie.  Every muscle.  Jerry didn't even acknowledge it.  Colin's just sitting there.  Shut your mouth.  Here's Lady gave him a long story short.  Stop mushing your little thin lips together so tight.  Say something.  I like Colin's hair holding on so long. 
[00:45:30]  Jesus, out of nowhere.  That should have been gone 10, 20 years ago.  That's true.  Still holding on like a piece.  He has sectional hair.  Each follicle has its own Sherpa.  Colin has four-piece hair.  From now on, every time you walk through the door, you've got to go, hello. 
[00:46:00]  He's letting the hand squiggy.  Stupid.  Just find something and jump on him about it.  We sure do, you fucking old man.  Exactly, you fucking big cock to the rest of the day.  Walking around your house with a swimsuit and a gun.  Fuck off.  Doing your big hands.  There was a home invasion in Glencoe. 
[00:46:30]  Yeah, very close.  Not close.  Yeah, it's close.  Nassau County right there.  Some woman got a door kicked open and then the guy, the son came downstairs and saw people  rifling through stuff with wearing masks and stuff.  Yeah.  No, when you go to visit Anthony, it's like that scene in Boogie Nights where they go over  to the guy's house.  Yeah, yeah.  I got it.  They're in the bathroom.  A young boy setting on firecrackers.  To Sister Christian.  Yeah.  Don't knock it until you're trying to.  It's a lot of fun. 
[00:47:00]  Damn.  I've done that, but on stage.  Norton's in a diaper just eating chips.  What's that?  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  You did not do that.  Fuck.  Bobby's in the corner cutting up the coke to make sure it's good.  If you guys remember that scene, you would love it.  Great scene.  Great scene.  He's got a fucking memory like an elephant and lobes to match.  You ought to combine yourselves.  I know.  You use your chin as the trunk.  You fucking chinless baboon. 
[00:47:30]  Baboon.  Baboon.  Baboon.  I think we should take it.  Yeah, right.  We can break.  Norton can't do it.  Oh, Norton.  Norton can never ponder.  Because he has no chin.  Slips down the side of his face.  It's kind of like when you put your chin on your hand and ponder something.  Like the dinker.  That's not stupid.  Yeah.  That's my chin reference.  I didn't say it. 
[00:48:00]  He did.  Shut up.  He, look at him.  No, I'm looking at you.  Go at him.  You want to ricochet off a fat bomb?  Take it for yourself.  Yeah.  Why don't you leave black Keith alone?  Yeah.  I'll take it.  You have to.  You guys want to order some food?  Yeah, let's eat.  Yeah, we'll get some food for you guys.  Let's see what's the email one more time.  Love for Patrice.  People say we're being vague.  We're not being vague.  We're not being vague.  Patrice had a stroke.  Patrice had a stroke.  Patrice had a stroke.  We don't know.  A lot of people are very devastated. 
[00:48:30]  We don't know what to say.  There's your headline.  Jesus.  We don't know what to say.  We don't know.  It takes a while with something like this.  It's not like a gunshot wound.  It's like there's a process.  I don't know what it is.  There's a lot of stuff that goes into it.  It could change every second, every day.  We don't know.  This is what we know.  We're trying to give you guys a way to get in touch with the family and let them know  that you care and that you guys can be out there supporting them and sending your prayers  and your good thoughts his way.  As soon as we know more, we'll let you know. 
[00:49:00]  Jimmy and we'll all let you know more.  We'll all let you know more.  It's been a week.  It's been a week.  It's still early.  It's very early, man.  We just don't know.  Sometimes it takes three weeks or a month.  We don't know.  We don't want to be vague.  We just don't want to make up facts and tell you bullshit.  We just don't know what we're going to do.  Because people are doing that.  People are not making it.  I'm not saying they're being malicious.  They're just saying what they think they know, and it's not true.  So we're letting you know what the real deal is from his wife, who Jimmy talked to, and  that's it. 
[00:49:30]  We just don't know the answers.  We wish we had more to give you than vague.  Our friend had a stroke, but that's all we know.  We should put the email on the pad data, too.  So make it easy for everyone.  Oh, they think they're doing that.  Oh, okay.  So, you know, if you want to send him some.  And a lot of people will hear this later in the afternoon, too.  We just don't know yet.  I hate to keep saying that, but we don't.  Well, why don't you let Voss say it in his front-of-your-salesman voice.  Give the email out, Voss.  Voss, you got a plug? 
[00:50:00]  No.  If I did, I'd put it in Colin's hair.  And just end it before it swings this way.  Just hit the button, O.B.  Just please end the show.  Just go to break, man.  Stop looking at me, everybody.  Fucking program director, Bobby.  Program director.  Program.  You really are, you southern loser.  Program to director. 
[00:50:30]  Keith just pointed at Roland and said, quit looking at Bob.  God damn it.  All right, we'll go to break.  We'll save you, Bob.  More with these guys.  Keith Robinson asked if Sam has a little black in him.  And we said that Sam was tested, Keith.  He was tested.  I don't believe it.  I got to see.  I need to retest.  He was tested in front of a whole black audience.  There's not a drop of black blood in this kid. 
[00:51:00]  How was he tested?  A lot of black girls, I give you a little, like, when he used to go out with that.  He used to just date black chicks.  Oh, you did?  Yeah.  As a matter of fact, I learned the other day.  That's all you need to know.  His fiance is like the first white chick he's ever gone out with, right?  Yeah.  After the test, you got rid of the black girl.  Fuck this.  He starts dropping the M-bomb like crazy.  He threw out all his cocoa butter. 
[00:51:30]  You see five empty boxes of Fruity Pebbles in the garbage?  We never eat Fruity Pebbles.  He threw, like, nine hats out the window.  Okay.  Yeah, like hats.  Sam, you're happy you're not black?  No, I would be fine if I was black.  Yeah, yeah.  Now, you're pretty happy you're not black.  He's black.  Yeah, you are black.  He is, right?  He's black.  So he fucked up the test somehow.  What else could he be?  Guessing?  Oh, no, he's not.  He looks like Noah. 
[00:52:00]  Whatever that kid, Jack, him Noah is, is what you are.  You're black, man.  He's part Swiss and part black.  100% black.  100%?  Yeah.  100% black.  100% black.  What is it?  What else are you?  It's all white European blood.  No.  That black guy looted that white guy a long time ago.  That's cool.  Hey, Sam, maybe he says the same thing.  Pointing at Bob.  I'm Irish.  Shut up.  You're not Irish.  I'm Irish.  You're Samoan and Mexican stuff.  That's not true. 
[00:52:30]  My name's Robert.  I have French-Canadian.  I have French-Canadian.  French-Canadian.  And we do French-Canadian.  And Irish.  Robert Patrick Kelly.  Maybe we just got a shitty company to test Sam.  Yeah, that's right.  Exactly.  Maybe we just got a shitty company.  We had a company in front of him.  He didn't like him.  He didn't use hot sauce.  He used ranch.  Yeah.  He put a pussy in front of him.  He ate it.  That was definitely black. 
[00:53:00]  Did the black chicks like you, Sam?  That's what we think.  Did they really dig you?  Yeah.  And even now, when I go into stores or something, black women always make comments about what  I should do with my hair.  Really?  Yeah.  White women.  Remember those days, comments?  Even now that you show them the test?  Even now.  Even now.  You show them the test.  It doesn't mean anything to them.  Those are credit cards.  Come on.  I'm sorry. 
[00:53:30]  Sam is black.  Did Roland take his beating?  You had the best visual ever with Roland.  And he's a Turkish Rex Ryan.  And he has his Jets jersey on.  Did he take it well?  He doesn't like being attacked.  Oh, he doesn't?  I think he has a soft spot for me, Roland.  You think?  I think so.  But we'll find out when he gets back.  Where did Roland go?  I'm putting in my eggs right now.  He had to go get the food, Roland?  No, he didn't turn to him.  Where's Roland?  Bring him in here.  I'm fine. 
[00:54:00]  Roland does, I'm sure.  By the way, just so everyone knows, Colin Quinn, Bob Kelly, Rich Voss, and of course,  Keith Robinson in studio today.  Yes.  Just fucking killing it.  That's what I'm talking about.  The ironic thing is, Patrice has zero respect for any of us comedically.  He doesn't.  He wouldn't watch any of our specials.  I don't think he's ever seen me do stand-up.  No one has snow.  You know, you can't just let him.  You can't.  This is not a normal show. 
[00:54:30]  If any other normal show, I'd say that.  You guys, all fucking four of you, five of you attacked me.  You all got, your eyebrows all went up, we got a better one, fatso.  You didn't wobble right into that one.  It's like you going into a playroom.  This never ends.  Anthony outside a gymboree. 
[00:55:00]  Wow, you just rewrote his joke.  And there he did.  Let him alone.  There you are.  Leave him alone.  Yeah, boys, leave me alone.  I'll try it when other people do it.  They put their own twist on it.  Gray Fox.  It's like you rewrote my Twitter character.  I don't complain.  Yeah, Foss, you are a thief.  I wish he did steal jokes.  I wish he did steal.  I just steal the bad ones.  I know.  The crowd is stealing.  Black eyes eat coochie.  I'm washing the machine door. 
[00:55:30]  She dodging me.  I haven't done it in fucking 10 years ago.  That's my feet.  You did it last week, stupid.  No, I didn't.  Let me tell you.  We have all the oil.  This is my favorite.  This is my favorite.  I did that one still.  My favorite.  My favorite Foss jokes.  Where are you from?  How about the time you're at the cellar and some girls won't mind.  You go, excuse me.  She goes, I know.  Could you buy me a house?  Oh, no.  She goes, I know. 
[00:56:00]  Could you buy me a house?  It was Bonnie.  Yeah, it was two weeks ago.  She goes, set it on fire.  He goes, hey, miss, could I burn you a house?  Oh, fuck.  Stop beating you again.  Let me tell you something.  Fucking.  Okay.  Fucking what?  Fuck all the stupidest spit it on.  I don't know where you're from. 
[00:56:30]  Saturday night, my second show, I did an hour and 20 minutes off the top of my head.  I didn't fucking stool.  Okay?  I didn't fucking run around and do fart jokes with babies in my fucking head.  Fucking bodak.  Because you're not clever enough to write fart jokes.  Off the top of your head.  It's the only choice you have.  So, wow.  These lights are crazy.  Yeah.  Yeah, look at the buffets down the back.  That's nice.  Right back to food. 
[00:57:00]  Is that the only place you do shows with his food?  I think Ross's furniture store Bobby could do his act there.  Big Bob.  I really want to break every...  Keith would never come because you're not a renter center.  Too wordy?  No, but we're fucking...  We're comics.  Come on. 
[00:57:30]  Too wordy?  Yeah.  Did he look like he'd fall through an awning, too?  Shut up.  Fucking that one.  Is that some of the jokes you told off the top of your head at the club?  Right off the top.  An hour and 20 ad-lib.  Get one of the 12 audience members to fucking...  Guess what?  Dude, anybody can ad-lib in front of eight people.  First of all, nobody in the history of comedy has ever done an hour and 20 off the top of  the head.  So, I'm calling you a thief and a liar. 
[00:58:00]  I'm calling you a thief and a liar and stupid.  Boss just says whatever's necessary in the moment.  I've been four hours.  Ladies.  Okay.  An hour and 20.  Okay.  It was an hour and 12.  Maybe an hour and five.  Yeah.  15 minutes.  It was 15.  Huh?  Where were you?  Newport, New Jersey.  Thank you.  Where were you?  Newport News.  Where is that?  It's the Vegas of the ACC. 
[00:58:30]  Damn it.  And I knew halfway through.  Oh, I'd love to...  I'd love to snap your number two pencil finger right now.  Man, I knew almost a quarter of the way through that one.  Actually get a number two...  I could have just said pencil.  Pencil, yep.  Yeah, exactly.  Number two is pencils topical.  Jesus, when was the last time you needed one of those for a test?  Holy shit.  I'll take it on iPads now, I think.  You know what's really bad when they don't even bully you?  You just try to help me with the joke? 
[00:59:00]  It's going to help you out.  Future suggestions.  Maybe you could...  Oh, fuck.  Opie, what are you doing over there?  Just a weird fucking morning, that's for sure.  Fuck.  Do you end up going to the fucking shitheads down there at Occupy?  On Friday?  No.  No?  Have they come up with one demand yet?  I want to get an update.  I heard Keith's people are acting up down there too.  I heard they robbed a couple of whiteys down there. 
[00:59:30]  Yeah, well, they're getting some riffraff down there that's going into the tents and just  like either sexually assaulting people or robbing them.  Also, they're having trouble figuring out how to divvy up the money because they've been  getting a lot of contributions.  So, they're pissed now that they buy food and clothes with this money for the protesters  and that other people are coming in and taking advantage of the free food and clothes and  money.  Leave Robert Kelly alone.  And not contributing to the protest, which is exactly what they're supposed to be protesting 
[01:00:00]  against.  You're supposed to give people some money when you have a little more than they do and keep  this whole even thing going.  And they're doing exactly what they're protesting about.  Yeah, but you can't say Keith's people.  That's fucked up.  You get one bad watermelon.  That doesn't mean the whole...  Oh, my God.  What?  What?  What fucking year is this?  Exactly.  What year is this? 
[01:00:30]  Just put on blackface and sing Mammy.  That's what we're going to do.  That's what we're going to do.  Just our kid in blackface for Halloween.  I'm trying to hurry up.  I'll save it.  Don't let him save it.  I'm sorry.  That's what he's saying.  He's saying.  I know.  He's saying it was Bonnie.  That's Bonnie's idea.  That's any party Anthony throws after three o'clock.  Oh, yeah.  Hello, my baby.  Hello.  Blackface.  Please.  I get a lot of candy for the children. 
[01:01:00]  And the inner city children do find their way into our neighborhood once a year for Halloween.  Why does Bobby shit like fucking Charles Derny in fucking Ragtime?  Oh, God.  Why would you try to even say Derny?  Charles Derny.  No.  Derny.  Charles Derny.  You know the thing on the hospital that you ride on?  Derny.  Dope.  Charles Derny.  What's his name?  Don't help him.  Oh, my God.  How many of your business?  Charles Derny.  He's amazing.  Charles Derny.  Charles Derny.  Stupid.  Can't get the new iPhone because we wouldn't understand him. 
[01:01:30]  What?  Oh, Bob is saying that stupid boss would talk into Siri and it wouldn't know what to do.  Right?  Yeah, exactly.  All right, whatever.  Come on.  Give me the bio of Charles Derny.  I don't know what you mean, stupid.  Again, stop talking to me.  Yeah, boss is talking to his thing and have water damage.  He's got the only iPhone with window wipers. 
[01:02:00]  Window wipers.  That's his fucking old car driving old man.  Windshield wipers.  Window cleansers.  Henry Ford named him that.  The old Model T.  Window wipers.  Window wipers.  Window wipers.  What the fuck?  Is that what Seinfeld turned on when he was driving away?  That's what he calls Colin.  A window wiper.  Pop, pop, sorry. 
[01:02:30]  How could you get my windows?  Colin's fucking jack-o'-lantern face.  What?  Nice accent, jack-o'-lantern.  Come on, Colin.  Anything else, Nana?  Yeah.  Got some tea in the jar?  Call me a jack-o'-lantern, you Mongolian, you Marlon Brando.  Easy there, you fucking queen of England.  I was going to talk about something really good. 
[01:03:00]  I had a really good thought, and then Voss spoke.  Fuck.  That is true, Rich.  Oh, trick-or-treating.  Of course.  They don't do, they don't do, they don't do, in New York City, when you, me and my wife  tried to, we got candy for the kids one year, but it's, you ate it all before they got  there.  You really, you just keep them empty wrappers.  Do you dress up as a garbage can and put a sign that says, throw candy here?  Wow. 
[01:03:30]  It was a little wordy, but it was a little wordy, it was a documentary.  No, this is the worst part about it.  He did the hand gesture.  You fucking idiot, you're on the radio, go fuck yourself.  Here.  But what you're trying to keep on candy in New York is that you feel like a pedophile, because  the kids don't come, they go to stores, they don't go to houses, because it's an apartment  building, you can't really get in.  You can't get in.  So you sit on the thing and you're like, hey, come over here, we have candy, and they 
[01:04:00]  just.  You don't have to give them candy.  What do you mean, what do you want to give them?  Handjobs.  They just bring it around.  Who said that?  Who said that?  It's wrong.  I'm just proud of him.  Because you can with those little hands.  Yes, exactly.  Perfect for a baby dick.  And now he's making me gay, too.  Who?  Pedophile and gay.  No, you're not gay.  How do you give a handjob?  Not you, we're talking about him.  Ask him or him.  Listen, he's playing me and Bob. 
[01:04:30]  Yeah, well, what are you going to do, Jim?  He's fucking running the mic.  He should be talking to fucking grandfather of fucking handjobs over here.  The first one to give a nice handjob to somebody.  Colin gives off candy in August.  Wow.  He hasn't had a lot of practice here.  Listen, Anthony.  Yeah.  So you're going to give out Cantony?  Cantony.  Cantony.  Oh, Jesus.  Cantony. 
[01:05:00]  Sorry, dude.  I'm going to give out Cantony.  I like when all of them turn at once.  It really is.  It really is treacherous.  Just an awful position.  Every year.  I like OPC because you can look at them.  I'm going to put a wall up soon.  You have in your personal life.  Oh, come on.  What the fuck?  I've never been to your house, Opie.  And you never will.  The fucking softball I just threw up. 
[01:05:30]  And swing hits, and it's out of the park.  I do get big bowls of candy, and then the kids come to the door with the parents.  It's a very Jewish neighborhood.  And you give them out, and you let them.  The honor system, they just grab a handful.  And then I had a bunch of inner city children.  I guess, had been bust into the area.  Whatever it is.  And I couldn't do that.  There was a kid.  I swear.  There was one kid.  Just took his arm.  And leaned it onto the edge of the bowl. 
[01:06:00]  And just let it pour into his bag.  I'm like, come on.  What'd you do?  Come on.  Nothing.  I was a spyless asshole.  He was 25.  His name was Keith Robinson.  Trick or treat.  Trick or treat.  Yeah, so, you know.  Yeah, we tried to give out Cantony when you can't do it.  All right, we know.  You said that already.  Jesus Christ.  What are you working on?  What the fuck?  What happened to this?  Go back to this, guys, really.  I really did go back to the world a lot. 
[01:06:30]  Halloween's coming, guys.  How many people?  Show of hands from anybody.  Let me hear from the people that give away a can.  Yeah.  Handful ladies.  Guys, I was trying to give away.  Remember when you'd actually go to people's houses?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, I remember that.  I remember that.  Yeah, now it's all 3D printers and cyber treating.  Boo.  Boo.  We take our kid to stores. 
[01:07:00]  We don't go to houses anymore.  We just go to stores.  Fucking Voss.  I was going to punch Voss's cake.  And those little baby hands.  I wish you just stopped after Voss.  I'll tell you, that green belt really came in handy.  Voss has got good reflexes.  He really does.  He really does.  Why?  Because I could turn? 
[01:07:30]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  You know what I'm saying?  He just hit me.  And if I could take a photo of these assholes and their evil faces,  and they just scan me like the Terminator.  Try to come up with fucking facts.  You know how long that's going to take us?  I have to die, stupid.  What are you chewing on? 
[01:08:00]  Nicorette gum?  Yeah, it's a brick.  Still.  What's wrong with you?  It's not Nicorette.  This is Dentine.  No, it's not.  It's Nicorette.  Yeah, how long have you been chewing Nicorette?  Huh?  How long have you been chewing Nicorette?  Fuck.  Since five years?  Let's see.  Since the last time you...  Oh, boy.  Trying to make it serious.  Yeah, that's that off-the-cuff stuff.  He was talking about...  The last time you were... 
[01:08:30]  An hour and 20 minutes of...  An hour and 20 of that.  Oh, shit.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What are you doing?  I'm looking at the food that came.  Oh.  Oh, great.  We're going to have Rich eating and being on the radio at the same time?  That didn't work well last time.  You've got to admit.  Come on.  When you were eating and on the radio.  It's the same thing as him being on the radio.  Isn't it the same size? 
[01:09:00]  Come on, off-the-cuff.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, no.  Halloween is funny, man.  I'm sleepy.  You know that Halloween, though.  Halloween is weird.  You try to give out candy in New York.  No, they go to the stores, the kids, apparently.  I heard that somewhere.  And a damn apartment, huh?  Yeah, yeah.  You can't get in them.  You can't get in.  You're a doorman.  Yeah.  We'll bring in their food.  We'll break.  Let these guys eat.  Yeah. 
[01:09:30]  You want to eat, right?  Huh?  You want to eat, right?  I know.  Yeah.  Why not?  I don't want to eat on the air.  Why not?  Huh?  Why not?  They'll just think it's rich.  Hey.  Would you call him?  Would you call him again, Colin?  Would you say he looked like a young Chaz?  Chaz Palminteri.  Is that me?  A little bit.  No, it's an actor.  I don't know.  Beans.  Louie beans.  I didn't ask for fucking potatoes. 
[01:10:00]  Oh, Jesus.  You're cursing again at the video.  What's wrong with you?  What's that?  Thanks, buddy.  Hold on.  Sorry, Kathleen Bates from Missouri.  I curse every now and then.  Excuse me.  Kathleen Bates from Missouri.  Thank you, Italian J. Moore.  What did you say?  Thank you.  Kathleen Bates.  It's the Italian J. Moore.  We heard you the first time when it didn't work.  We uncomfortably looked away.  I mean, how many things is he that you're going to think about tonight when you're dropping  a batch on your stomach?  Jesus.  Wow.  You think Colin's going to jerk off to the young intern in what could have been? 
[01:10:30]  I'm a big fan, Mr. Quinn.  Why don't you give us a kiss and prove it?  Let me tell you something.  When I was on remote control, I could have fucked any 14-year-old boy in this country.  Jesus.  How much I fucked?  How would you say that?  That's true.  That was true.  You could have fucked quite the looker back then.  There's fucking meat. 
[01:11:00]  Oh, he's stopped.  There's fucking ham in here.  Shut up!  Exactly.  Why are you nursing every time we took a look at this?  That's Robert's meal.  Stupid.  That's not mine.  I don't like peppers and red.  The tattooed Jew won't eat ham?  I don't eat meat.  What the fuck?  Yeah, you do.  It's not red meat.  It's the other white meat.  Pork or something.  Are you a vegetarian?  I don't dig on swine.  I don't eat...  I don't dig small.  I don't eat fucking meat.  I have a ham omelet.  That's what that is, dummy.  That's a ham...  Stupid.  Open that and look.  Just open it and look.  I'll open it when I want to.  Stop forcing me to do what you want. 
[01:11:30]  Maybe the intern got it wrong.  Stop forcing me to do what you want.  Stop pointing those little fingers at me.  Do you want to eat your own?  I don't have to watch his fingers.  It didn't.  I touched one piece of fucking...  It's like outbreak.  Yeah, you are trying to sound tough.  Fuck it.  Fuck it.  Yeah, get me the fucking cheese.  What are you, 14?  I want no fucking potatoes.  Shut up.  Whiny ass.  Stop looking at my food.  Dude, I'll fucking open it in a second.  Relax.  Yeah, thanks, Keith. 
[01:12:00]  There's bacon.  You don't eat that.  We got your bacon on the side.  Yeah, and then it's a ham omelet.  Don't you eat like turkey bacon or something?  See, it says ham right on it.  Ham.  Oh, what the fuck?  What do you order, Voss?  Yeah, what do you say?  Do you order vegetables?  It's just one piece of ham.  One piece of ham, baby.  It's your omelet.  It made it in, dude.  It's one little piece.  Let's go.  The omelet doesn't have ham in it.  You really are just dumb.  How do you know?  You cut it open.  What are you?  You're a fucking pro at food.  I can't tell. 
[01:12:30]  You are, too.  You were.  There's no ham in there.  There's no ham in there.  Like Colin's just sitting out eating.  All right.  He's listening to everything.  Yeah, we'll do some eating.  And up.  Bam, bam, bam.  Yeah, we got Keith Robinson, Rich Voss, Bob Kelly, and Colin Quinn in here.  And, of course, Jim Norton and a lot of people just tuning in, Jimmy.  Yeah.  They're a little confused.  So, to you, brother.  Well, all the guys came in today.  It's kind of awkward.  We didn't know how to do it.  But for anyone who's just tuning in, they all came in today because we had to announce 
[01:13:00]  that Patrice had a stroke a week ago.  And, you know, none of us wanted to do it on our own.  So, we just.  I did not want to put these on.  Go ahead.  Stupid cue.  So, we wanted to announce it together.  So, he had a stroke.  He was in the hospital.  And if you have.  What's wrong with you?  You're just dumb.  If you have well-wishings or whatever and you want to email them, just send it to 
[01:13:30]  loveforpatrice at gmail.com.  And we don't have.  Yeah, the word four, not the number four.  We don't have any.  We don't know him any more than that.  We don't know.  We just know that he had it.  And it's too soon to tell.  That's the way it is with a stroke.  And I have no frame of reference for it.  Like, I don't know anyone who's ever had one.  So, I don't know how long it takes to get, like, a real feel for it.  Or I just don't know.  I don't think anyone of us know.  So, someone earlier thought we were being vague. 
[01:14:00]  We're not being vague.  We're just telling you what we know.  Yeah, we just don't know.  And we know you want to send flowers and stuff, but don't because he's staying somewhere,  but he's being moved.  So, they're going to just wind up there, you know, clogging up a hospital for no reason  because we don't know where he's being moved to.  So, email him at that address if you want his well-wishings.  His wife will read them to him or get them to him, print them out and hand them to him.  I mean, I don't know.  So, that's why these guys are in today.  Yeah, and we'll, you know, we'll let pertinent news out about it as we find out stuff. 
[01:14:30]  But, you know, so don't believe everything you read on stupid Twitter.  Yeah.  From stupid Rich, especially ripping off stupid Colin.  By the way.  Oh, Colin.  Anyone else going to call Norton on saying fucking well-wishings twice?  What does that annoy me?  Oh, did I say it twice?  Did that annoy you?  Well-wishings.  It's not even a fucking expression.  Well-wishings.  I didn't mean to say well-wishings.  You said it twice.  Oh.  You said it for the whole time.  I didn't realize I said it.  I'm a fucking idiot. 
[01:15:00]  Send your thoughts.  I guess I could say thoughts.  Thoughts and prayers.  Thoughts and prayers.  What's Rich going to send?  Just the prayers.  I'm going to send some well-wishings.  Oh, well.  How was your breakfast?  Bobby was really bothered how you eat your breakfast.  What was the problem with his breakfast there, Bobby?  And how he eats it.  Because he eats like a homeless person on the streets.  He starts a little garbage can for himself.  Yeah.  He makes a little garbage can.  He puts gum in it. 
[01:15:30]  I sort of garbage can as far as to put waste in it.  Cheese.  But there's a garbage can, a regular one over there.  You don't need to make your own and leave it out on a table like you're going to be here  for 24 hours.  You can walk over and throw your...  You ripped your cheese out of your omelet.  Don't get cheese.  No, I don't want to eat all of it.  I don't want to watch you deconstruct your omelet.  Some people have a little self-control.  I wanted some cheese, but I don't want to watch it.  Self-control.  The way you ripped that out of there was disgusting.  It was disgusting.  It was disemboweling something. 
[01:16:00]  Self-control would be not getting the cheese.  Or maybe only getting half of one.  Don't say...  You know, it's psychotic.  It would get the cheese and then rip it out.  You fucking OCD little fucking hand.  Jew.  Jew.  This is a very racist show.  It is.  I know.  It has been since 1997.  It's not racist if you sing it.  Jew.  Okay.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  No, I'm joking.  Whoa.  It was the first time today.  Damn.  I didn't say anything.  I didn't say anything. 
[01:16:30]  It's always had racial overtones, I'd say.  I don't like racial overtones.  Look how they mess you, man.  I don't like that Anthony throws a little bell out when fucking Keith comes in.  What bell?  What, this one?  Yeah.  That's the bell where if there's any speculation that a crime has been committed by somebody  probably of African-American descent, I usually ring the bell so people know because no  description's given.  Well, it's not just black people that commit crimes.  No, I know that.  But they're the ones where we talk, you know. 
[01:17:00]  Mexicans are really good.  Mexicans are pretty good.  Did you see Colin's face when Keith said that?  What?  When you say only not black people commit crimes.  It's not.  Right.  Okay.  I don't know.  Really?  Good one.  Throw it.  I'm going to stand there.  Can I have some orange juice?  No, you can't have my orange juice.  Why do you want his orange juice?  I forgot to order some.  Who does that?  Look at the mess you made in front of you.  Yeah, I told you.  You're fucking horrible. 
[01:17:30]  This whole show is a mess and you care about one little part of the table?  I just love jumping on.  No, I love it.  It's like a beat down.  But how does he make a big mess when he's eating an omelet?  It's like being one of the guys that just walks over and kicks the guy in the ribs when  everybody else is fighting and then walks away.  I love that shit.  Oh, Rich is getting beat on.  Boom.  Kick him.  Walk away.  Yeah, I got a shot in.  It was fun.  You see me kick him?  Kick his ass?  Yeah.  That's good.  By the way.  That's it.  What happens with those fights?  Starts with a blind side to the head. 
[01:18:00]  And then the guy's on the ground.  Five people come out of nowhere and just start kicking the guy.  And that's it.  I sent a tweet out yesterday about a story, a guy in Peoria, Illinois.  It's very appropriate because it was about you.  That was Bob just breathing normal, by the way.  That's what happens after two steps.  I thought it was from the tryptophan from the turkey he just ate. 
[01:18:30]  No?  That would be a big meal.  We got it when he said that.  Oh, God.  All right.  Jesus.  Tryptophan.  I tripped a fan.  Tryptophan.  God, it's not a fan.  Yeah.  Right?  Please help.  Tryptophan air conditioning.  You should be installing.  I know.  I worked.  His hands worked like a man at some point.  Like you, motherfucker.  Telling jokes your whole life.  I did not.  I worked.  Getting sexually assaulted by a stepfather.  It wasn't a stepfather. 
[01:19:00]  It wasn't an assault.  He took his cock out.  Bob knew he was doing it.  He was old enough to know exactly what the hell was going on.  Exactly.  He had a T-bone steak on a fucking barbie.  Bob was driving.  He was waving his cock at Bob.  It was to Sunni Delhi a month ago.  He would come in his own hand and then just hold it out.  Bob would lap it up.  Don't say it.  I don't like when you say it.  Are you a cum eater?  If anybody's a cum eater, it's you.  Good one.  Oh, well, well.  I'm rubbing your glue. 
[01:19:30]  I love just hearing you try to say glue.  I say glue.  There's nothing wrong with glue.  No, you need it to hold your teeth in.  Implants, baby.  Glue.  Implants.  What happened in Peoria?  No, glue rhymes with.  Glue.  Boo.  Moo.  Sue.  Stu.  I'm going to sue if you keep going on.  What was your story?  Yeah, Peoria.  Just another. 
[01:20:00]  Fucking boring.  No neck shit dick.  Go.  Sorry.  I'm sorry.  There's some of this.  There's just no reason for it.  Jimmy wants to tell a story.  Yeah, it's from 8 to 10.  I'm sorry.  Go ahead.  Tell it, Jimmy.  It's called 8 to 10.  Shit.  But in Peoria, Illinois, there was a crime committed.  Yes.  Yeah.  And they wouldn't name the perpetrators. 
[01:20:30]  They quoted what the perpetrator said to the woman as they pointed a gun at her.  They called her a honky.  Oh.  So I tweeted it.  Was it a big Leah?  What's that?  So I tweeted it.  And someone sent me an answer back that the reporter had sent them.  And he said something about, like, well, there was enough facts given where the race was implied.  I didn't need any more adjectives.  Because he wouldn't say that black guys had done it.  He was just afraid to say it.  He wouldn't say white people.  So he said honky.  Black guys from the fucking early 70s.  Exactly, yeah.  He's been in jail for 40 years. 
[01:21:00]  Honky.  He's got no frame of reference on the time.  That's a good times reference.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Sorry.  Yeah.  Florida, that honky didn't give me the job.  Oh, James.  No.  No, James.  Get out of the car, you jive turkey.  I love that fucking show.  I still watch it.  Nothing good could happen to that family.  They're all happy.  James is going to get a job interview for a better job that's going to get him out of the projects.  He sits down.  This just a white guy that just can't stand the black man is interviewing him. 
[01:21:30]  He's qualified for it.  But it's like, well, I don't think you're the type of guy.  But tap what you mean, black.  Whoa.  And the audience goes crazy.  And then he's got to come home and tell his family they're still broke.  But there's love there.  And then he's in studio with us now.  And then he was actually sitting.  Oh, God damn it.  You know, he came through the comedy cellar.  Yeah, yeah.  He was on the show.  He's great.  Patrice were walking out that night. 
[01:22:00]  We saw Colin pushing a car.  Remember when me, you, and Norman were driving fucking Sherman Hemsley to the fucking cellar that night?  And fucking, we took him for wings.  Everybody, from crack addicts to old white men, everybody recognized him.  Oh, they love him.  As we walked down the street.  Yeah, yeah.  It was fucking great.  We took him for wings.  Who doesn't love George Jefferson?  Yeah.  Jesus.  They're ready to attack you.  I see Colin's ears are perked up.  Yeah.  Those are just Colin's ears.  I like the fact that you cut off Keith's story about John A. 
[01:22:30]  Talking to the mic.  You're on a radio show, stupid.  Talking to the mic.  Yeah.  Quit sitting like Martha Stewart.  Who?  Stewart.  Who's Martha Stewart?  Who's Martha Stewart?  Who's Sturt?  Who's Sturt?  Sturt from Jersey.  Sorry.  Why does your mouth just panic?  Oh, your little leg got a cramp?  Good.  Oh, Martha Stewart.  Yeah, so John A.  What were you saying?  What were you saying?  I was saying he cut off.  You're right.  I'm sorry.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm sorry because no one's cut anybody off here today. 
[01:23:00]  Sorry about that.  Sorry.  Go ahead.  Tell us about your story at the cellar.  I lost my enthusiasm.  Not even train of thought.  12 years ago.  God damn it.  Oh, fucking rich.  Hey, Willis and Norton are the meanest fucking counterpunches in fucking comedy.  It really is terrible.  Norton, they really are good counterpunches.  That's true.  It's painful, man.  This kid really got it. 
[01:23:30]  See, I hit a counter one time.  He's like, I'm not even counting them.  Chip on the other hand.  Not so much.  Chip stinks.  Oh, chip.  Your wife likes chips.  Brots.  My wife fucking bugs this shit.  My wife does chip to me.  Fucking bugs the shit out of me.  What was the message I sent you?  I'll pick up your 40-pound iPhone.  It's got a battery case on.  I understand it.  As soon as I was at home, Bobby just pulled the emergency brake on the train. 
[01:24:00]  I'm not waiting for him to look on his iPhone.  Yeah, he's just strolling.  On that giant iPhone.  The iPhone's made this size for a reason.  He's got these aftermarket batteries on there that make the thing fucking giant.  I'll tell you why.  It's like a fucking iPad in his pocket.  Tell me why.  Because when you're out and you can't plug your phone in if you're going to be out all fucking day.  You can do fucking the Catskills getting minerals and rocks.  Some of us don't just yap for four hours and then go home to our fucking palaces. 
[01:24:30]  When you're out digging for fucking diamonds.  I'm a little jealous.  You never know when you're phone.  What, are you on your mind?  A little jealous?  Oh, that's true.  I fucking want to kill you and take over your life.  I fucking slice your throat while you're sleeping, you fucking dirty guinea.  I take everything.  I take your cock, your hands, your hair, your new hair.  Listen.  Yeah.  Motherfucker.  It's the new battery on the phone isn't as good as before. 
[01:25:00]  But why does it have to be lime green on the side like that?  It doesn't.  You can change these out.  These pop big, Bob.  These just pop right out.  Oh, good.  You just have to buy stuff to fill the void.  Well, at least get rid of that.  It defeats its own purpose.  Yeah, I do.  I like it.  It's so big.  So, it's a double battery life because the battery sucks on the new iPhone because of  the new processor.  They have to update the actual software to make the battery life work better.  Will they do that?  Huh?  Will they do that?  Yeah, they'll do that.  They do it on every phone.  But the battery life stinks. 
[01:25:30]  If you use your phone as much as I do, because, you know, I don't just, I have to fucking  do a bunch of shit to pay my mortgage, not just one thing, and then have somebody whip  a car up and jump in and drive home and fucking put a gun on my hip and swim in my pool with  my fucking no-neck friend, Jimmy.  Hey, let's get in the jacuzzi.  Okay, yeah, let's go.  Fucking yogi bear.  I don't know you.  We would let you come over and go in the pool.  We don't have to throw fish into it. 
[01:26:00]  They're already filled with water up this high.  Let's go to the radio.  Separate your fingers.  Okay.  It was about an inch.  You just let them.  But the new iPhone is the battery stinks.  I haven't noticed, because I charge it usually.  You know, I get home, I charge it.  I'm not out fly fishing where there's no socket.  Yeah, you don't do anything.  Exactly.  You do this, barely, barely, then you go home. 
[01:26:30]  You're absolutely right.  You put way more effort into the other show that you do.  Hey.  I haven't even done one in a while.  No one knows.  No one even knows.  I have other people that come down now and do shows in my house.  You got t-shirts now, right?  Who cares?  Yeah, people are getting mad at me.  Why?  Because I got upset about myself.  Are they Nazi?  They're not Nazi shirts. 
[01:27:00]  That's what I heard or something.  No.  They're close to it.  It's an L and an F.  It's a brown shirt.  Live from, and then it says the compound, but the L and the F, the way it's kind of set  next to each other.  It looks like a couple of sticks have been snapped off of something that may have been interpreted  as a swastika.  Yeah.  Jesus Christ.  What I'm saying, I said the same thing.  It was just a coincidence.  It was just a coincidence.  It was just a coincidence.  No, it was that simple.  You didn't realize it was going to look that way.  You didn't fucking smile as soon as I came in.  If you take a crucifix and bust off two sticks, then it's just a pole. 
[01:27:30]  Whoa.  See?  See?  Swastika's not a swastika unless it's a swastika.  If you take Bobby and break off his arms, he's still a mess.  You want to see a swastika?  Let me show you the tattoo on my chest.  I had higher hopes for it.  It's not welcome.  Cut off your Shylock nose.  Fucking American History X.  You've never seen it?  Yeah, I saw it.  Not on my watch.  Yeah, but when you say it, it scares us.  Yeah, I know.  Edward Norton was acting when he said it.  Yeah.  Acting. 
[01:28:00]  He didn't stick his eyes out.  Looks like Jimmy.  Voss just turns and punches Jimmy in the face for no fucking reason.  I've been called a bad actor by the world's worst actor.  Holy shit.  Two fucking silent film actors attacking each other.  He should be on a railroad track with a train coming.  His biggest role was when he exploded at the end of Ghostbusters.  Wow.  Shut up.  That was worthy.  Lousy actor in a shitty comic too. 
[01:28:30]  Take him sip.  Oh, Jesus.  All right.  Who blew it out?  That was me.  That was me.  You farted?  I did it, yeah.  I've been farting all morning, but nothing.  That's a bad one right there.  Is it bad?  Yeah, especially in a room full of people.  I'm in a good section.  I can't even get it.  You can't get nothing?  I'm in a good section.  Whoa.  Well, that's bad.  That's a good one.  You learned this thing rotates.  Holy fuck.  I didn't get it.  I took it away.  Jesus.  Wow.  It's not that bad, is it?  It's pretty bad.  It's real bad.  Holy fuck. 
[01:29:00]  I thought that was Keith's career.  Keith's career?  What?  I thought that was Keith's career.  No, no.  It's coming here.  It's swinging around.  It's swinging around now.  It's like musty, right?  It's like musty?  Yeah, it's good.  Like a wet coat?  Oh, you got some there, Colin.  It's finally made its way around.  Yeah, yeah, you got it.  Yeah, yeah.  It's all done over here, I think.  It goes clockwise.  Holy fuck.  They rotate.  It does.  It's in a clockwise direction.  What did you say?  Huh?  What?  Nothing.  Talking to the microphone, you idiot. 
[01:29:30]  What were you saying, Voss?  Tell us some more Halloween stories.  What did you say?  Nothing.  Yeah, what did you say, Voss?  What did you say?  I don't remember.  Oh, God.  Alzheimer's.  What did you say, Samuel?  What, Colin's hair?  Dropped his hair?  He said it dropped my hair.  He dropped your hair?  No, he said the fart dropped my hair.  Oh, because it was spiked before?  Jesus.  What?  I'm doing fucking radio with David Cross.  I fucking, I don't like anybody in this room. 
[01:30:00]  No, it's really, I just realized that, too.  Now we're all just looking around like jackals, just waiting to fucking pick at any exposed piece  of meat.  When he's left, yeah.  Yeah.  The scraps of a joke.  I can't get squiggy out of my head, though.  Because fucking his little curls coming down in the front, down that little thing.  Just push that up right there.  No, you fucking panda. 
[01:30:30]  Panda.  What?  A fucking panda?  That was such a schoolyard insult, too.  No, you fucking, and then just running through anything fat.  Panda's a fat.  Oh, shit.  No offense.  They are cute, though. 
[01:31:00]  Give you that, right?  Thank you, Anthony.  I appreciate that.  He's helping you out.  Fucking panda.  He's trying to, you know, make some lemonade.  What are you going to do?  What are you going to do?  So, are you going to take your kid out trick-or-treating?  Oh, there you go.  Back to Halloween.  What are you doing?  Don't do it in the city.  Because you know what?  You can go to the stores right here.  You have to.  Yeah, I have to.  Because the buildings, apartments.  You can't stand out front. 
[01:31:30]  You're like a pedophile.  The doorman will stop you from going in.  Are you going to dress up this year?  Well, I have a party that I always throw.  I have a leak because I've never been invited.  Oh, shit.  The invitation, I didn't even really put it on a list this year.  Because the last party was so fucking out of hand that I just figured I'd tell people  I'm having a party.  What is it, a Halloween party?  Yeah.  No, it's a Christmas party next weekend.  Fucking dunced.  How come you guys don't do live events anymore from like the Hard Rock and stuff?  We just did one recently and we're doing another one soon. 
[01:32:00]  Don't try to fucking rejuvenate your career through these guys.  They think we're trying to hold on to their career.  We're fucking...  We're on our fingernails on a ledge over here.  That's like how small the studio's gotten over the last time here.  We're on fucking Joe Franklin right now.  Remember the days when we could all have a fucking chair at the desk?  Yeah, exactly.  In case we didn't have to oil him to get him through the door.  That was funny.  We'll rephrase what Bois meant to ask you. 
[01:32:30]  How come you guys don't have live events, which I'm invited to?  Yeah, that's a little tag on that one.  What was the last live event you had?  You had the interns doing something, right?  They were doing comedy, yeah.  It's the staff.  At the Hard Rock, yeah.  And I wasn't invited to that, thank you.  What's your next one?  We didn't feel you were up to par with their...  With their comedy?  I wanted to invite you to perform.  You know, it's funny, though, when you...  The last contest that I was...  I love looking at your staff right now.  I'm looking at Eric and Sam, how much they're interested in the show.  They're just both on their phones checking their Twitter about their fucking lives. 
[01:33:00]  They could give a shit who's calling, what's going on.  Hold on, I'm sitting next to Sammy the Bull.  You fucking snitch.  Jesus Christ!  I like that you had to fucking explain your joke.  That's good enough.  Because some of the listeners, I might get it.  Okay?  Some of the listeners.  When I say Sammy the Bull, because you look like a bull.  No, you're a fucking rat.  These guys are in here fucking...  Just say it twice.  The last fucking event I went to that I hosted that you never even came to, and it was... 
[01:33:30]  Oh, damn.  You had a cold or something or...  I don't know.  Something crazy.  What happened?  Now, your last two events, I don't get invited.  I'd like to know what the fuck the deal is.  Whoa.  I don't book this show.  No, no.  Really, let them know.  Oh, bullshit.  Yeah.  It's time that Voss knows.  No, but it is time for Opie and Anthony to finally stop.  Oh, shit.  You don't book this show.  Yeah.  You guys are responsible for it.  Yeah, I hear that from club owners.  Hey, I don't book it.  The head office does.  You guys make choices.  Am I passing the buck? 
[01:34:00]  Did you hear me?  Did I do that?  No.  You're sitting there, and he's sitting there.  Did you get...  Oh, wow.  Bobby doesn't even know.  He just trounced the pot.  Trounced the pot.  I can't even talk.  I got a boss idea.  No, I just got sad because he just said, I hear it from club owners.  It's like, Jesus Christ, Voss.  No, it's not, Voss.  I don't book my own club.  No, it's not.  It's not a joke, Voss, but continue.  Yes, so I would like to...  I'm kind of hurt right now that...  Yeah.  We don't even remember why. 
[01:34:30]  Out of all these guys...  At this point, wasn't Voss invited?  Oh, E-Rock saying you were in Arizona.  There you go.  I was out of town.  You're out of E-Rock.  They checked your schedule.  I called and asked me if I was in Arizona.  Because we checked your schedule.  I knew you weren't around.  Huh?  We knew you weren't around.  Now it's we.  Now you are part of it.  Now wait.  You can't wait.  Because it's over.  What's over?  What's wrong with you?  Your career is over.  Oh, really?  Yes.  Look who's talking.  We're doing another live event.  I better put somebody's car.  We're doing another live event.  So if you want to come, show up.  It's really over.  Unless you've got penciling and you're burning your house down. 
[01:35:00]  Or something like that.  What's your next live event?  I think I'm done.  This next live event is Kristallnacht.  November.  Actually, I think it is in November, actually.  Nothing better than a good 1930s joke.  That only you two could get fucking guests.  Oh, bats.  Because he's old and you're a Nazi.  What's your next event?  We're not telling you.  Don't tell him.  Don't tell him?  I can't go on every horrible website. 
[01:35:30]  That's true.  And find out.  Find out where we are.  What is your next event is?  And what's that song going back from break?  All jokes aside, voice.  Christmas is coming up.  And he'd like a couple of days of work.  Yeah.  I worked New Year's for the last 20 years.  I need something.  If watch New Year's like Mr. Saturday Night, I lost my winter.  Shut it.  I lost my winter. 
[01:36:00]  A whole season.  What's your next event?  I like to reconnect with your fan.  I love it.  I love it.  One fan.  That's it.  Just one.  Yeah.  You forgot to put the S on it.  Like that exaggeration.  Oh, Chip.  You ruined the joke.  When is it?  What's it about?  Yeah.  When is it?  And I'll be honest with you.  I have no idea.  They tell me. 
[01:36:30]  They go, show up.  I'm like, all right.  Not sometimes.  I don't know.  They say, show up.  I say, get a cold.  You tell me when I show up.  Yeah, sure.  I'm going to show up.  High in the Sierra Mountains, drinking champagne, champagne cocktails.  We're going to cancel it.  Huh?  We're going to cancel it.  You're going to cancel it?  Yeah.  I love it.  What was it?  Let's do another tour.  What was the live event?  Oh, my God.  He's really reaching for the brass ring right now.  Enough about the live event. 
[01:37:00]  It's not going to happen.  Do you have any of those?  No.  Why not?  I don't know.  Okay, so what happened at the kid, Chris?  Christmas fucking.  What happened to Colin?  Oh, man.  What happened?  You think it was bad for Bonnie.  Then he went on.  Kid Christmas.  Say kid Chris Christmas.  Say kid Chris Christmas.  What happened?  What happened?  Are you well-led assholes?  Kid Chris Christmas.  What happened?  Try the lips off and then try it again.  Never have so many dumb thoughts come out so clumsily. 
[01:37:30]  You should eat sand before you try to talk.  What's that good with?  Mayonnaise or mustard?  Mayonnaise.  Mayonnaise.  Fucking mayonnaise.  It's still working.  Oh, shit, man.  Another counterpunch.  It's not good.  It's not good with mayonnaise.  It's not good with mayonnaise.  It's not good with mayonnaise.  Mayonnaise.  It's like he's used to being attacked or something.  Yeah.  He definitely knows.  Kid Chris Christmas.  Yeah.  What happened?  Kid Chris Christmas.  It got a little rough for my buddy Colin. 
[01:38:00]  Yeah?  Who was on the show.  Yeah.  Well, it's not the...  First of all...  First of all, who was on the show?  Huh?  Second of all...  Speaking of the mic.  Okay, it was...  I hosted it.  Bonnie got fucking...  He says proudly.  At least I'm ashamed I did it.  And then it was local guys.  You know, I think Chris McDevitt or whatever.  Chris McDevitt, wow.  I know I did, but don't look at me.  No, but I like the fact that Norton's trying to forget his past.  He's like, don't bring up Chris McDevitt.  I don't think I know Chris.  I don't know Chris. 
[01:38:30]  It's just the stories taking this turn to this details of minutiae.  Shit that we don't care about.  They asked about...  No, he asked about the story, not who was standing in a certain place.  What happened to Colin?  He's giving satellite coordinates.  Come on.  He was on the fucking show.  Give this shit.  What happened to Colin?  Tell the story.  What happened to Colin?  We don't need the guest list.  What happened?  Summarize.  What happened to Colin?  He killed him. 
[01:39:00]  He killed him.  He fucking stinks.  Tedious.  Fucking tedious.  What happened?  What happened?  I don't remember now.  Come on.  I don't remember now.  He has his voice.  What?  Did he have to do stand-up?  What are you feeling like in attack of conscience?  I should never have brought this up.  Yeah, you brought it up.  It's just confidence.  It's confidence.  Oh, shit.  You.  No, you.  What happened?  Gargoyle Hans, tell the story.  I got one funny fucking story, Bob.  Why?  Keith was on the Apollo. 
[01:39:30]  All right.  That is pretty funny.  Did you do well at the Apollo?  Oh.  You bombed.  I bombed.  I took one.  You know who does well at the Apollo?  Asian guys that come out and either dance or sing hip-hop.  They fucking love watching an Asian guy singing hip-hop.  Thank you, Ben Lyons.  Woo!  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  I figured I'd fill you in on that.  You know, Halloween.  Ben Lyons.  Now, boss, what happened at the show?  Oh, Jesus.  What happened to Colin? 
[01:40:00]  I could just see Anthony sitting home watching the Apollo.  Look at the way they're jumping up in their seats.  I have watched many episodes of live.  Where'd you get that tree stump?  The friggin' motherland?  Rub the log.  And then the sandman will come drag your ass out off the stage if you're not good.  I think Bobby's petering out.  Yeah.  I think Bobby's starting to fade.  I can't wait till you do.  He's starting to fade.  Not visually. 
[01:40:30]  Verbally.  I don't like having to look at the back of your gray neck while you're talking.  Fucking old douche.  J. Jonah Jensen hair.  Stop cutting your own hair and splurge and get that taken care of.  Exactly.  Where's your gray?  Everywhere.  Are you shitting me in my hair?  Dude, everywhere.  It's in your hair.  It's in your eyes.  You look like a fucking blind dog.  I love how after a good one, we all reward ourselves by picking up our cups. 
[01:41:00]  Everyone drink.  Everyone drink.  Your cup is really full.  Damn it, Bobby.  That's fucking good.  Jesus.  Kid Chris.  Yeah.  Kid Chris Christmas.  Kid Chris did a show, you know, in Philly.  Like, remember the place you guys did that?  Remember that?  I did to the fucking point. 
[01:41:30]  Was it Tony Collins?  Was it tough for him to do stand-up?  Is that all you want to say?  Because he's too clever.  And that, well, it all started with how come he didn't do any of the virus shows?  Because the audience loves him, you know, until he opens his mouth.  But, you know, we were asking why he didn't do any virus shows.  Boring.  Oh, shit.  You got two guys sleeping, boss.  Did Colin bomb?  No, he didn't bomb.  Yes, I did.  Well, that's why you're bringing this up.  What happened at the show?  What happened?  Why did he bomb? 
[01:42:00]  What happened?  Get to the point.  That part is obvious.  Just get to the point.  Why did he bomb?  I was including...  Let him tell it.  No, no.  He should tell it.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  Just tell it.  I don't remember the whole detail.  Just tell what happened.  I don't remember the whole detail.  Just the way he says things.  What happened?  What a child.  I got me in a serenade on the first 48.  I don't remember the whole detail.  You really are dumb.  All I know is that the act on before me was on a treadmill on the stage. 
[01:42:30]  Well, we know it wasn't Bobby.  Oh, man.  Oh, man.  Everybody in the room.  Everyone.  Fucking Opie stood up in his chair.  Everyone.  I was going to whip on a fucking hot zinger.  Everyone jumped out.  Fuck yourself.  Yeah.  First of all, that could have been the easiest one ever.  We got a lot of fucking potential fatzos again in this room.  Okay? 
[01:43:00]  Fat tits to the right.  Fat tits to the left.  Fucking brown fat tits to the back.  The guy was on a fucking treadmill on stage.  Yeah, so you can't follow a treadmill axe.  That's what you're saying.  Why would they...  What about Stairmaster axe?  Can you follow them?  What was up with the treadmill?  It's a bitch that tore it around.  Some dildo thing with the treadmill.  I was literally on a treadmill on the stage.  Why?  Was it getting laughs?  Wait a minute.  Let Voss tell a story.  I don't remember the treadmill.  Yeah, Voss. 
[01:43:30]  We got all the details.  I don't remember it.  It's a good story.  Let him tell it.  I sent it over to him.  He doesn't want it, though.  Yeah, he wants to tell it because he wants to let go.  He's been carrying this resentment.  If he tells it, he lets it go.  Let go and let God.  And I'm going to tweet that later.  As Christian Voss?  Yes, Christian Voss.  No, I'm Jewish Voss.  Now you're Jewish Voss?  Voss's hands...  They should be over a library entrance.  That's my line again.  Just put some cream on it. 
[01:44:00]  I go, you should be hanging on an overhang above a library.  You know how many times I've done gargoyle over a library?  I've done it for 20 years.  You've never been in a library.  We've already.  And you call it a library, idiot.  I said library.  His hands are...  Voss is really tough.  You just got to put cream on him, dude.  Exactly.  I'm sorry it's before eight.  I didn't fucking lather up.  What?  I mean, you lather up.  In your mouth, you always do.  Yeah, just...  Why don't you just lick your hands like a fucking animal? 
[01:44:30]  Oh, there he goes.  There he goes, Voss.  I don't know.  You just said, there he goes.  There he goes.  You really have the hands of a dead person.  They do.  No, no.  It looks like they took skin off a dead person, and then he put them on his hands.  That would be the same as hands like a dead person.  But it would be different.  This show sucks.  Oh, it's the worst.  Why can't you breathe?  Stop.  It's terrible.  When I was saying it...  Because I had that idea.  Yeah, and then he fucking polished it up.  And you had to follow through. 
[01:45:00]  And I had to follow through.  Because you never know.  So you went on after a treadmill...  Was it a...  Dildo act.  Dildo act.  Yeah.  Nice.  That's tough.  Yeah.  Well, how long until did you know that it was going to be a problem?  No, they booed...  I tried to get my first joke.  I go, don't boo me.  Because they booed a couple of people off.  And I was like, don't fucking boo.  And they just booed me.  That always works.  Yeah, exactly.  You don't want to knock it off in your head ever.  I said, let me get my fucking...  In the electric factory.  I go, let me get one joke.  It's not fucking...  And they just booed me.  They didn't let me get one joke.  That's good.  Try to appeal to their sense of fair play. 
[01:45:30]  Guys, you don't know who I am.  Let me shout out.  Let me have one.  Don't do it.  Why is this old lady up here yelling at us?  Why is who?  I said, why is this old lady up here yelling at us?  Don't you let me say my joke.  Let me...  I respect your elders.  It must have been like when Quincy got in front of that punk rock crowd.  Children, I need to find this girl. 
[01:46:00]  And they're just like, why is Quincy in front of her?  She's got a treadmill and a dildo.  Don't boo me.  Don't boo me.  Yeah, that never works, by the way, because you're challenging them then.  It's like, I'm not going to listen to this guy.  No, the bully had already started.  I said, let me get one joke out.  You got to get me one joke.  What joke were you going to do?  I don't remember.  It was seven years ago.  I said what?  I don't remember the fucking opening line of the electric factory at one gig seven years ago.  What did you do last week?  It was probably the same line. 
[01:46:30]  You said that.  I'm calling you that.  You didn't turn that one line into some kind of one person.  Don't get serious, stick dick.  You fucking...  Oh, fuck.  I hate when he does that.  He fucking gets a good one, then he goes right to serious.  I'm...  Oh, yeah.  There is a...  Do you hate it, really?  Yeah, I do.  How bad do you hate it?  A good one?  I don't know.  Do I hate it?  Silence.  Yeah.  It wasn't a good one.  Vos gets serious when something bombs.  Yes.  Yes.  Which means there's a lot of seriousness.  I like that he's covering his little hands now, at least. 
[01:47:00]  Yeah, exactly.  I'm getting cold.  Trying to keep them from popping out.  You're getting cold because there's no fucking blood going to those little fucking catcher's  mitts.  Fucking atrophied hands.  Yeah, your little fucking webbed fingers.  Yeah.  Your hands are petrified.  Yeah.  That's the way it should be.  Wrapped around your chest like a mummy.  You're a daddy, right, Bob?  I fucking hate chips.  All right, let's take a break.  Jesus Christ, guys.  Fucking chip.  Break time?  Yeah, we'll break.  What? 
[01:47:30]  Huh?  Oh, you know what?  Yeah.  Do not plug.  This is for real.  Do not plug.  No, but this is something, a good one.  Do not plug.  This is about me, Colin, and Bobby.  Oh, all right.  Because we're doing a benefit for Mikey D.  November 9th.  Mikey Stefano, say it.  Mikey Stefano, November 9th.  I don't know where it is.  That's a great plug.  We'll get all the info up on our web.  No, we're doing misinformation.  We'll be performing somewhere on some night.  That's good.  That's wonderful.  Mikey Stefano.  We'll continue. 
[01:48:00]  All right.  We got Colin Quinn, Bob Kelly, Rich Voss, Keith Robinson, Jim Norton.  It's been a weird morning, but a fun morning, that's for sure.  Jimmy, once again, with the Patrice thing and the email.  People are tweeting about it.  Dane was tweeting about it, too.  Let's tell Dane to call in.  Dane can definitely call in if he's listening.  I know if he's listening.  Patrice had a stroke.  That's why we're all here.  Patrice, yeah.  Patrice, of course. 
[01:48:30]  A week ago.  It don't went down totally.  And we don't know anything.  I mean, all we know is it's too soon to tell.  The family has requested that, you know, we know people love Patrice, but they've requested  that, you know, you don't try to show up because he's being transferred, so they just don't  need any hassles and fans showing up.  But if you want to send your prayers.  I said well-wishings before and got a justified beating.  Well, you should have.  It's love for Patrice, L-O-V-E-F-O-R, Patrice, one word, at gmail.com. 
[01:49:00]  And as more comes out, we'll let you know.  I mean, the family will either make an announcement or tell us.  We just don't know.  It's too soon to tell.  It's, you know, it's only a week after a stroke.  It takes a lot longer than that sometimes to know even how it's going to turn out.  We just don't know.  So we're not trying to be vague with you.  We just, I want to make shit up.  And it was starting to get out there.  I think people are starting to know.  So we wanted to, all of us, get together.  Rich, what is Rich doing? 
[01:49:30]  I'm fucking deleting some of these fucking idiots on Twitter.  We're having a moment and you're looking at your Twitter.  Are you fucking kidding me?  You couldn't wait.  We're all listening to Jimmy.  There's a little more going on.  He said that Dane fucking, what?  But did you see?  What?  And then he pops up.  I'm going to delete some of these people.  Do you know what's going on?  He's a fucking self-centered douchebag.  Are you sure you didn't have a stroke?  But he's like this the whole time.  Holy shit. 
[01:50:00]  Colin is losing his mind right now.  Of course.  Colin, what?  What was your observation?  He was angry like he was being angry at a person like this.  Only he's looking at his phone like this.  With all the stain on his face.  And Norton's telling the sad thing about Patrice.  Hey, Jesus.  I'm just looking at Patrice.  I'm looking at boys on Twitter account.  Just block them with no emotion, dummy.  It's not even a person.  Just block them.  It's fucking 140 characters with a goofy icon.  His eyes are squinting with anger. 
[01:50:30]  That's all it is.  Norton's giving his bizarre, felt thing about Patrice.  Jesus.  Fucking Rich.  What happened, Rich?  What are you doing?  Rich is grabbing his balls and doing like a jig around the room.  What are you doing?  What's wrong with you?  My legs are cramping.  Oh, good.  That's because they're dangling off a fucking chair.  Yeah.  They're usually sticking straight out in a high chair.  Yeah.  Fucking self-centered creep.  You're chasing Jennifer Aniston with a hatchet.  It's like your fucking career.  It's dangling.  He sits in that chair like when Otto brings George. 
[01:51:00]  Is that how I shouldn't it?  Yeah.  Okay.  Okay.  What did the guy say?  What happened on Twitter?  What made you so mad?  That was way more important than Jimmy spilling out his emotions.  What happened?  What did he say?  What did he say?  I don't know.  He's above that.  He doesn't want to give them that satisfaction.  Yeah.  You brought everyone's attention.  You ever had those cramps in your legs?  Yes.  God.  Yes, boss.  Everyone's had a cramp in their legs, idiot.  Never?  I was just going to start applauding.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I have.  I have. 
[01:51:30]  I have.  Standing on stage, it doesn't seem like a lot of work, but you know, when you get  cramps in your legs.  Voss is making jokes up again.  Go for 120.  You ever get a cramp in your leg?  120.  Remember the 120?  Yeah.  He said 120.  Rich was confused by 120.  He didn't know what that meant.  Come back, Rich.  Where are you going?  Where are you going?  Walking it off.  What, your life?  Let him find a pier.  No, he's right building. 
[01:52:00]  Those fucking hands, he could swim back to shore.  Fucking baby seal hands.  Yeah, and there won't be water.  Oh, forget it.  What?  You old, fucking tired, gray asshole.  Did Jimmy go back to his thing?  Yeah.  You all right?  I'm sorry.  Did I cut you guys off?  No, actually, no.  I think I finished.  Did you give out the email?  Yeah, I gave out the email.  So we're all, obviously, we're fucking around.  We're all really worried about Patrice.  And he'll be okay.  It's terrible.  It's terrible, terrible.  It sucks.  But again, we wanted to make sure people knew this is not a memorial service. 
[01:52:30]  We're not, it's just, we're just letting you know what's going on.  And we kind of wanted it to come from, you know, all of us as people who are really close  to him and not just some random douche or, you know, some, I don't know the agency's  name, but whatever.  I'm going to get into it.  This is some scumbag.  When I find out all that.  We're going to get into some stuff.  There's a scumbag, scumbag agent out there.  I know the fucking agency's name.  I know, but I'm not 100% sure I want to confirm it. 
[01:53:00]  But when I find out, I'm going to say it on the air.  The fucking vulture fucking agent.  And you know who you are if you're listening.  You fucking vulture.  Yeah.  That I'm being vague about.  It's very sad.  But we're all positive.  We got hope.  And we just, you know, all those fans out there, we just, you know, to send positive thoughts  over to his wife and his mom and to Patrice and all that.  What are you doing, Voss?  What the fuck are you doing? 
[01:53:30]  You're trying to talk.  Voss is doing this thing where he's massaging his legs.  Your self-centeredness is killing me.  It's mind-boggling.  I hope it does.  Let's throw Voss out of the studio.  Please.  Voss, you're making it about yourself.  Voss, sit the fuck down.  This is why you're not invited to the lobby.  Exactly.  You're like a sociopath.  It looks like a horse in a stall.  I know, but dumber.  Same teeth, though. 
[01:54:00]  Jesus.  Why don't you, hey, take off all that tight denim you're wearing.  Yeah.  Maybe you could have some sick bravo, right?  Maybe if you weren't dressed like Danny Zuko, you wouldn't be uncomfortable.  Fuck, fucking zilch.  Would you sit down alone?  You'd dress like Christy McNichol from Little Darlings.  That's right.  That's pretty good.  That's pretty good.  You heard him, stupid.  Now, why don't you make out with Armand Asante?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That was a little old.  What's the matter?  You all cramped up?  Set the fuck down. 
[01:54:30]  Exactly.  His carg sucker brought up Armand Asante.  How do you remember that?  You all right now?  No.  What hurts?  Where?  What's wrong?  What hurts?  What where?  Like where?  What muscle?  In the back of the...  I'm being serious.  In the back.  In the back here.  I think he was blocking that Norton move before I really got to you.  Yeah, exactly.  Stopped me from crushing your cake.  Stretch it out.  Work it out.  That's what I was doing, but I got yelled at.  No, you were standing there, hunched over on the fucking console, shaking your leg in front 
[01:55:00]  of Bobby while he's talking.  Did you have a karate fight with garbage cans again last night?  Exactly.  Your ears.  You just took my fucking joke.  Yes.  And I said, off the air.  Come on.  Fucking elephant male queen.  I mean, I called them garbage cans of ears.  And you stole it.  You stole his character.  You're taking my jokes.  You're a fucking hack, boss.  You're doing the hokey pokey.  You really are a fucking hack.  I've never seen a physical boss like this.  Yeah, you're doing the hacky pokey. 
[01:55:30]  Now we know.  You were the guy on the treadmill with a dildo, weren't you?  Yeah.  You put your little stiff hand in.  You suck it.  Too much sound effects.  Yes.  Hey, boss, sit down.  I like looking at Anthony.  Maybe everyone nervous.  Yeah.  Sit down.  Why don't you go walk around the studio outside?  Stretch your legs.  Yeah, why don't you go walk into another show?  Yeah.  Why don't you go play in traffic or something?  Ah, shit. 
[01:56:00]  Fucking shit.  I need a banana.  It's a good one, Chip.  Huh?  You what?  Why?  You need potassium?  You can really just tell him one little fact and he goes with it for the rest of his life.  Podassium's good for cramps.  I need a banana.  Okay, you know what?  Maybe I'll have an apple.  Do you think you're going to eat a banana and you look perfect?  I'll have to feed it to you with my hand flat.  I don't eat that big tea.  You fucking mule.  I have nice tea.  Shut up, you do so.  You do not be.  Quiet donkey face. 
[01:56:30]  You fucking braying idiot.  You great donkey.  Shut up.  You're like a children's book, The Great Donkey.  That's just so terrible.  Now I know why you only have one of us in at a time.  I know.  It's just a feeding frenzy.  You can only do this once in 20 a year.  Pack mentality.  Fucking pack mentality.  It's just awful.  Everybody just stays out of the studio.  Nobody wants to come in and get trashed. 
[01:57:00]  No one wants to get trashed.  You don't want to say anything?  No.  This is like WrestleMania.  One little stutter and you're fucked.  E-Rock's checking his phone again, Bobby.  You want to tell everybody?  E-Rock, what are you looking at?  I was looking at websites around the world now that we're posting about the news about  Patrice.  Oh.  Keeps doing.  Stop shifting.  What websites?  They just seem to be comedy websites.  Nothing mainstream yet.  Right.  In the UK, the United States, and Canada. 
[01:57:30]  All right.  What were some of the websites in the US?  Does it matter?  Yeah, it does.  So people can go to it, you fucking idiots.  I'm just putting them up on Facebook.  You fucking dumb cunt.  Oh my God.  There's a lot of things going on now.  That was the worst one I've fucking seen yet in this studio.  That was the fucking worst one.  Keith, you're going to have to roundhouse somebody.  Get out of here.  I wouldn't even fucking blame him.  You're going to have to roundhouse somebody.  Holy shit.  What happened to the table and Voss is holding it? 
[01:58:00]  What do you think happened?  What happened for the people out there?  What did you do, Voss?  I didn't do anything.  Own it.  Own it.  What did you do?  He fucking picked up the banana.  He went to hand it to Keith.  He said, could you peel this?  You fucking animal.  Go have your potassium the way you like it.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah, there you go.  You really can get a lot of that banana in his mouth.  Is it weird for you to eat a banana without smelling a urinal mint?  You want to stick it to a hole for you? 
[01:58:30]  And Bob and E-Rock were arguing about something.  Oh, that's what I was laughing at.  Yeah, I know.  It was fucking stupid.  Because if we want to do it, you cunt.  Because I wanted to give out a couple of the, you know, so they can go and read about or whatever.  Find out if they, you know, websites that people go to and don't.  Does it matter?  Yes, you fucking asshole.  Oh, shit.  But I think E-Rock didn't like the fact that you acted like you were one of the show guys.  I'm not.  I'm just fucking saying.  I'm sorry.  I stepped on your fat toes. 
[01:59:00]  Oh, right.  The house calling the condo.  What?  What?  The house calling the condo what?  On fire?  You're stupid.  Jesus.  I should have called 911.  What did you say?  I'm calling the camera.  Say it in the mic so people can hear how stupid you are.  Exactly.  You banana-chopping zilch.  We understand.  E-Rock.  What is it?  Back to E-Rock.  Back to E-Rock.  E.  What websites? 
[01:59:30]  Last Spin picked it up, but they're transcribing pretty much what was said here on the show.  What Voss said?  I hope they're not transcribing Voss.  Actually, Voss is quoted in it.  Voss is quoted.  What is Voss's quote?  It was all serious stuff.  Nothing stupid.  Nothing stupid.  You sure it's a Voss quote?  Right.  Comedy website in the UK called Chortle.  Chortle?  Chortle.  That's a laugh.  A chortle.  Oh, a chortle.  Yeah.  Goddamn Brits. 
[02:00:00]  Oh, look at the way this headphone...  Even the headphones look dumb.  I know.  He puts one headphone ear on his ear, but then the other one's on top of his head.  There's no fashion show here, folks.  Why do you wear them like that?  It's more comfortable.  It's not comfortable for anybody.  How could that be comfortable?  He actually has a third ear underneath that fucking hair.  Ooh.  Ooh.  A third ear. 
[02:00:30]  Voss is good at this shit, man.  He's a fucking counterpuncher.  Oh, yeah.  Yes, he is.  He's got one good right, and then he's got a lot of good counter...  He can't fight for too long.  He doesn't hit first, but...  No, he'll hit...  He's waiting for you to hit him.  He fucking...  He loses.  He dumps his adrenaline quick.  Yeah.  He gets one good one.  How's the leg, Voss?  Now that you had your potassium.  You're good, right?  We're not going to have to put you down, are we? 
[02:01:00]  Did the banana help with the cramps?  Immediately?  Not immediately.  It's going to take time to go through your system.  Yeah.  Not as much as mine as yours, but...  Like three hours.  Why?  This is...  No, you can't do that.  You can't just add it to the end of something.  You can't do that, man.  Oh, that's fucking great.  The way he broke a rule, brother.  Yeah.  He just broke a rule.  What's this guy?  He has ears on his head or something?  I just...  You hear what I said?  It's a good trial. 
[02:01:30]  God, I wish it was a call-in show.  It was a good trial.  I'm going to stab at it.  Everyone was calling, so...  But, you know, whatever.  Yeah, we got shit.  That's it.  Take phone calls from dope-ass listeners.  We know what Jimmy has told us.  Yeah.  Dummies.  Yeah, we want to.  Let me know.  We'll let you know as we know more.  Yeah.  It'll come from...  That's how it works out.  Probably the family or all of us.  Yeah.  That's a cool shirt.  What are those?  That's cool.  I hate this shirt.  I realize as soon as I put it on. 
[02:02:00]  Epilets on top?  Yeah, what is it?  He's the dumbest guy.  You're the fucking...  It's like you're in Starfleet.  It's like you're in Starfleet.  I'm fucking believable.  You are really dumb.  Are you doing another read?  Another read?  What do you want?  I didn't have both sides on.  What do you want?  What do you mean another read?  Jimmy, literally fucking talking about...  And you go, nice shirt.  You're just the most self-obsessed idiot.  I was complimenting somebody.  It's not self-obsessed.  No, but you're wrapped up in your own dumbness. 
[02:02:30]  Really?  You could fucking be distracted by tinfoil.  Fucking moron.  Shiny things?  I'm so angry at fucking Voss.  I wanted to attack Bob for that.  Right, right.  But we got to focus on the annoying Voss at the time.  It's a disinterest in others.  But you know.  Why aren't you interested in others, Voss?  I'm very interested in others.  No, no, no.  Believe me, I help.  That's my middle name is help. 
[02:03:00]  Yeah, it's good base.  I really am.  His confirmation name is cry4.  He didn't make a confirmation, remember?  Jay.  Oh, right.  Exactly.  Right.  Jimmy, what happened?  I'm very interested.  What did Voss do this time?  I'm sorry.  I was...  What did he do?  It's just we're talking about things,  and he's just so wrapped up in his own idiocy.  He just looks at you and goes,  nice shirt.  I know.  It means nothing.  It's mind-boggling.  It's sad.  If the shirt was on fire,  maybe you could bring up the shirt.  The same part is. 
[02:03:30]  Put that nice shirt out.  That's what I would say.  You're right.  He's going to go home to Bond.  He's going to say,  I did an hour and 20 off the top of my head.  I got Opie's shirt six times.  Started with the Star Trek.  Worked my way around.  What do you...  And she's like,  what do you mean?  He's like,  that's why you don't get a headline,  because you don't know the Star Trek shit.  You got to go for it.  He's got some stuff, I guess.  What?  The articles we've been finding,  we've been putting them up  on the Opie and Anthony Facebook.  And you got the email up there for Patrice?  Email's up there.  It's up on the pad data here  if you're listening now. 
[02:04:00]  And what Facebook page?  Opie and Anthony on Facebook.  There you go.  And that's the websites  that are out there?  What difference does it make?  That's the ones that don't fucking matter,  the ones you put up there,  those websites.  Boy, he's probably  not happy.  I like it.  Not happy with fucking E-Rocks.  Bob didn't like being dismissed like that  by another chubby guy.  Well, no, it's not that.  It's just, you know,  I think it's important  that those websites  are fucking out there,  that people know where to go  to find out information.  He didn't like E-Rocks. 
[02:04:30]  Snide them.  I wouldn't have liked it either.  No, I didn't.  Dismiss.  It was kind of.  It's not important.  What do you do?  Why do you even talk, Bobby?  Yeah, what a fucking twat.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's the fucking twat.  Does it matter?  Shut up and just fucking  push the button.  E-Rock, you gonna take that?  What can I do?  Colin loves this kind of shit.  Why do you love it?  I fucking love E-Rock.  He knows that.  Colin, break it down for everybody.  I like when Colin  breaks it down for everybody. 
[02:05:00]  Why don't people say  I love E-Rock?  You don't love E-Rock.  I like E-Rock a lot.  Yeah, you went down to like...  I love...  You love him a lot.  I like him more than I like you.  Well, it doesn't matter.  I don't give a fuck about that.  I ain't saying much.  You love him?  Yeah, on the level that I love, yeah.  What level is that?  It's just very shallow.  Fucking...  I can do something for you.  What can you do for me?  Nice to see you.  Merry Christmas.  That's about it.  That's your whole take on love, right?  Just fucking...  That's great.  Nice to see you. 
[02:05:30]  Take care.  My take?  It's all of our...  Shit.  We're fucking all hunks of garbage in here.  There's not one fucking human being in this.  It used to be Sam, but you guys killed that?  With hopes and dreams of his own show that's never gonna happen?  We really do kill the passion of anyone.  Who's Sam?  Exactly.  The black kid.  That's it.  The black kid.  That's the end of the show.  Who's Sam?  Who's Sam?  The black kid that took a test.  Not one person in this room has fucking any good qualities.  We are really damaged. 
[02:06:00]  It's not even damaged.  Most of it's by choice.  Do you understand that?  We have a choice to be good people to each other.  Or scumbags.  And we're not.  We're self-serving fucking assholes.  Nobody rings anybody's doorbell.  Nobody comes over.  You call any of these fucking assholes for help, but it's fucking like...  Write to voicemail?  Yeah.  Look, dude.  My printer's fucked up.  Let me call you back.  Okay, my aunt's gonna die, but okay.  Call me back, Norton, when you get a shot, all right? 
[02:06:30]  And that's coming from a man wearing sunglasses like Amelia Earhart.  We don't like your fucking aviator pose, stupid.  They're on top of his forehead.  One day I was talking to fucking dumb calling about some really dumb shit I was going through.  He's like, yeah, all right.  I gotta go, dude.  Just by chance, I brought up a fucking comedy thing, a question.  An hour and a half later, he'll talk to me about comedy for fucking hours.  But your personal life, go fuck yourself.  You bring up emotion.  He's like, listen.  All right.  We can't deal with our own. 
[02:07:00]  What are we gonna do with someone else's?  Distortion!  Are you shitting me?  Yeah, that's where the funny lies, stupid.  No one called me.  What am I telling facts?  Trevor, boss has another story.  He called me last night before he started.  He goes, I only have a minute.  He was laying down the fucking timeline.  No, because I had to leave.  I just wanted you to know.  I was just talking to him about today.  What's wrong with that?  Yeah.  What was wrong with that, boss?  Because maybe I wanted to talk for three minutes.  About what?  But he called you.  Himself, I'm sure.  Exactly.  I don't talk about myself.  I compliment him.  No, we do. 
[02:07:30]  We do.  First of all, he just said everybody here is fucking damaged and fucked up.  Don't pull your little fat thumb to me.  You agreed.  And then you go to me like I'm the one who's fucked up.  Some more than others.  Okay.  Well, okay.  So maybe I need a little more help than you do.  Yeah.  Okay.  But then help me so I can help you.  I don't know if you can help me.  And I don't want to help you, so I guess we're both fucked here.  We can cut your microphone and help the audience.  Cut your throat and help the world.  You cut your hair and help the barbecue. 
[02:08:00]  That's a great one, Chip.  Hey, Chip.  Fucking Chip.  I hate Chip.  That fucking banana is working.  Is it?  Oh, the crap's going away?  Yeah, it's good.  Nice.  It doesn't work like that.  It doesn't.  It's just stupid psychosomatic.  You've got to take potassium for like a month straight every day.  You can't just have a banana and fucking shit happens, stupid.  You don't roll a banana on your leg and you feel better.  Yeah, you do.  You do.  You're done the milk packing district.  Take it rectally.  It works.  The milk packing district. 
[02:08:30]  No, that's not the milk packing district.  I make a cute face when I fuck up now.  The milk packing district.  Aw.  That's where you stand in a barn.  Aw.  Jesus Christ.  Opie hasn't got one fucking smashing today.  I'm smart.  That really fucking aggravates me that that fucking ginger hasn't got one fucking...  Oh, I've gotten beat up.  Voss tried to go out and do shit, but nobody will do it.  Opie hasn't...  I'm hanging low today, dude.  You really are just laughing.  I'm not stupid. 
[02:09:00]  You're over there just stupid.  But Voss wasn't even slamming Opie's shirt.  He was giving him a genuine compliment.  Yeah, I know.  It's hard to jump in the pond here.  No, he was...  No, I wasn't.  It's not even fucking compliment.  He was complimenting me.  The shirt's just all right.  No, why would you attack him?  And I like it.  No, you were.  You were.  You were hoping that there was something there.  There's not much going on there.  Anywhere over there.  But I like that shirt.  See, now he's reaching over the console.  He's reaching over the console.  Colin had it right.  Yep. 
[02:09:30]  Yep.  He was sniffing for it.  Of course he was.  I didn't even see that.  I respect that about him.  He's like, yeah, I like that shirt.  He's hoping the rest of us will be like, what shirt?  No, because then he would take credit for it.  I'm a captain in a fucking gay army shirt.  It's called an assist.  Yeah, that shirt's still gray.  It should be like on Voss's neck.  I don't know.  I fucking hate shit.  Yeah.  Will you fix your headphones, please?  Exactly.  With a shotgun?  What were you going to say? 
[02:10:00]  I was going to say, if Opie wants to dress like Alvin Ailey, that's it.  You can look, Colin.  I'm laughing.  You had some good ones on his shirt, so you restarted it.  Just do anything I'm sitting here.  He does dress like the keyboard from Buckaroo Bonsai.  All right, then.  First of all, it's a keyboardist, you dunce.  A keyboardist? 
[02:10:30]  You don't dress like a keyboardist.  Just a keyboardist.  Sometimes you get to throw them up and see what happens.  A keyboardist with food.  A keyboard is a key that you're talking to.  Fucking ruthless.  Jesus Christ.  Oh, those headphones look dumb.  Oh, they do.  Why are we like that?  Just to bug us?  No, it hurts my other ear.  What's wrong with your ear?  Why don't you have a fucking apple for that?  You're next to it.  You're next to it.  You gotta give an apple. 
[02:11:00]  That was pretty good.  Oh, thanks for the credit.  Wow.  You validated my existence.  And you really do shit.  You do mean that.  Shut up.  Shut up and go to a meeting.  Holy shit.  What the fuck?  No, look.  It's stupid.  This is comfortable.  It hurts my ear.  Why?  Why does it say I got blackheads in my ear?  Why do you?  What?  I don't know.  And your mouth and ass. 
[02:11:30]  Exactly.  You'd hear me if you had both headphones on, stupid.  I'm not going to repeat it.  See what you're missing?  You don't have both headphones on.  You're a fucking hypocrite.  You don't have both headphones on.  No, but what's behind the top of his head?  What's the difference when I contentioned it?  Because you're visually unpleasant.  Oh, really?  Yes.  Yeah.  And don't call me a Bobby crit.  I don't like it.  Oh, what are you?  It's a hip-hop joke.  Oh, my God.  Fucking brilliant. 
[02:12:00]  I'm sorry I explained that.  That's just caught on, by the way.  No shit.  It was a fucking vampire.  The sun's starting to set.  Cucksuckers fucking coffins starting to open.  Norton's catching on fire now.  He's a little hot.  That little chinless fucking twat was tired earlier.  Now he's waking up.  Oh, fuck.  Look at him.  He's looking at Colin now.  Everyone just looks around like, what weakness?  Any bit of weakness. 
[02:12:30]  Yeah.  That's right.  It always goes between Voss's ears.  Oh, my God.  Keith's a little...  Oh, we did that joke around.  Yeah.  I know what you're going for, but...  Oh, man.  We can't end like this.  Shut up, Keith.  Where are you going?  Certainly can.  Keith's looking at his watch.  Yeah, stop looking at your watch.  Where are you going?  He's tired, man.  He was up all night or something.  I was up all night, man.  What time does the bus go back?  Oh, jeez.  What the fuck? 
[02:13:00]  Watermelon bus.  Fucking...  Handed him a banana.  I did not do anything.  The banana, I feel bad about that.  That was...  Well, tell him, not us.  Tell him about us.  Apologize to me.  I can't look him in the face.  Turn around and apologize.  You're like, bro, I'm sorry if that was offensive.  It was.  Old school racist.  He really is old.  Bobby just knocked the headphones off of Voss's head.  That's the most exercise he's done this month.  He's going to say he played handball.  At least I can.  That's true.  You've got to play with a marble, stupid. 
[02:13:30]  You've got to play with a marble.  Fucking doll fingers.  Fucking...  Oh, this is brutal.  We could wrap this up then.  I know a bunch of you guys want to get out on it.  You guys aren't going to be able to follow this this week.  You might as well take the rest of the week off.  All right.  Right?  Take the rest of the week off.  I'm giving you the rest of the week off.  If you want to see Rich Voss, he'll be a Jennifer Convertible, so I'm moving on. 
[02:14:00]  And if your car breaks down and you need someone to push it, look at the spit you just put on that fucking...  Look at how the spit...  Oh, loogie.  It was a hunk of banana.  Yeah, now he's got like banana gook in his mouth.  Well, it's kind of...  Yeah, it's a little bit.  That's gross.  A little bit.  As long as the potassium's surging through that system.  Since I've got these new teeth, a lot of food sometimes gets stuck up in here.  Where?  He's got his little finger and his horrible gums.  Between your lip and gum?  Yeah.  Can you floss those? 
[02:14:30]  Can you?  That's a good question.  Can you floss those?  Yeah.  He has to use like one of those little fucking car racetracks.  I'm just wondering if they're...  Have they all connected?  Or are they separated?  Is it one big tooth with lines drawn on it?  Is it a fucking mouth guard for football?  You have to put it in hot water every day and just bite down for 20 seconds?  Wow.  Jesus Christ.  When did you know, Bobby?  I fucking bite down.  I know. 
[02:15:00]  Do you understand?  Because we all know pretty early on.  I knew.  How much more?  I had to say you can't stop.  You can't stop.  There's so much more to say.  You gotta go for it.  You gotta go for it.  He said it's like food.  It's like food or his comedy career.  No, he can't stop.  You got me again.  I got it.  Folks.  I knew we couldn't all be here.  All right.  One more time. 
[02:15:30]  Oh, my God.  You did it properly today, man.  I'm so fucking lonely.  We just wanted, now people would Twitter it and do the words out.  We just wanted it to get out from this way.  From us.  Yeah.  From people who love him.  Yeah.  Can't stop people from starting rumors or whatever.  We don't know.  The news is we just don't know anything.  Patrice had a stroke.  We don't know the status.  It's going to be a while.  It's the way it is.  That stuff.  Hope for the best.  You know what I mean?  And that sounds corny to say that, but literally that's all you can do.  His wife and mother are, you know, they are taking care of him, but they're going to 
[02:16:00]  transform so we know that everybody wants to send flowers and cars.  It's just what you do when someone's sick, but we don't know where he's going to be and  you don't want to just send them randomly.  It's stupid.  So just have some respect for the family right now.  That's the main thing.  Have respect for the family.  We know you love Patrice.  We do too.  That's why we're telling, we're all telling us together.  But, you know, the email's there for you to send your, you know, if you want to say  something to the family, they're going to be reading them.  Be respectful.  Don't be an asshole.  Yeah, and just send your thoughts and prayers and best wishes. 
[02:16:30]  And as we know more, you know, Norton and people will announce it, but that's the facts.  That's the truth.  You guys know what's really going on and don't believe all the other bullshit that's coming  out and don't, you know, try to respect the family as much as you can.  Well, certainly when Jimmy gets more of it, he'll bring it to the show.  Yeah, as soon as the family, you know, as soon as they say something can be, you know,  talked about, whatever they're comfortable with, we're kind of following their lead, whatever  that his mom and his wife wants. 
[02:17:00]  Rich, you want to comment on someone's pants during this?  Yeah, exactly.  No, he's too busy on his fucking...  Bobby's phone.  Why can't you focus while we're doing this?  We are doing a Mike DiStefano benefit, too, because Mike passed away last year.  And we're all doing, you know, we're trying to help Mike out, his family and his foundation,  which is another sad fucking story, too.  Mike DiStefano.  Too many sad stories.  Yeah, well, no, you know, Patrice isn't, you know, Patrice, we got hopes and prayers for,  so Mike DiStefano's thing is me and Colin and Voss are doing a bunch of other people. 
[02:17:30]  It's November 9th at the Tribeca Performing Arts Center at 8 p.m.  You go to CringeHumor.com for tickets.  We're trying to, you know, help Mike's family out and his foundation, which was sad shit  that happened last year.  So, you know, you know, that's it.  Meh.  You know?  Meh.  Life fucking stinks.  Yes, it does.  It really does.  Yeah.  Just muddle through, hoping for one good fucking day where you could just maybe crack a little  smile, but for the most part, it just sucks. 
[02:18:00]  It sucks.  Yeah.  And then you just hope for fucking Voss to fucking splur something out so you can make  fun of it.  Just a nice fat Bob Kelly joke.  Forget about our own miserable lives and pile on his miserable life.  A thin fucking Colin Quinn finger joke or a no-chin fucking worm joke from Norton.  I'm sick of this Norton.  I'm sick of this more stuff.  Leave AutoZone manager haircut off.  AutoZone.  Jesus Christ. 
[02:18:30]  I know he's looking at your hair right now, though.  He's looking at that fucking goddamn Phil Collins hairdo you have.  I can feel it coming in the airtime.  I'll keep sure you can't on your hair.  All right.  Yeah.  Coming down the mountain or something.  Oh, shit.  Oh, Christ, Chip.  What the fuck does that even mean? 
[02:19:00]  I don't know.  I fucking hate Chip.  I just hate him.  No, you don't.  Who aggravates you more, Chip or E-Rock?  Oh, man.  Chip.  Chip is a motherfucker.  Colin loves that shit.  Chip is a motherfucker.  I want you to break it down because I love when Colin breaks that shit down, the inner  workings of the show.  But not today, I guess.  Fuck it.  Nah.  All right.  We're going to fucking step aside.  Thanks, guys.  We've seen him around.  It was done properly.  Yes.  Thanks, guys. 
[02:19:30]  Thanks, guys.  Thank you.  Thank you.  We'll obviously see you guys as individuals in the near future.  Later.  All right.  See you later.  I have Colin Quinn on the phone.  Oh, great.  Jeez.  Nice interruption.  Hi, Colin.  What's happening, guys?  How are you, Colin?  I'm grand.  Grand.  I can't believe I'm on the show.  I took you on modern technology.  This is ridiculous.  Did Bob Kelly wake you up?  No.  Actually, I'm awake. 
[02:20:00]  Why are you up so early?  Alive and kicking.  I was just calling him to see if maybe he fell back asleep after his morning radio so  we could wake him up, you know?  Why help each other get over those crazy times on the road?  Oh, you know, Colin's tired from pushing Jerry's Porsche down the road the other night.  Yeah, Colin.  Colin, you talked to Jerry Seinfeld about that accident?  Yeah, but then a night later, his Porsche died, and I had to give him the old jump start.  Seriously?  Yeah.  Yeah, his Porsche died on Minetta Way, and he had Colin push his one of 38 Porsches down 
[02:20:30]  the side street to get it started.  To have to bump start it, yeah.  What the fuck?  Does Jerry own, like, a bunch of shitty cars?  The brakes fail?  The thing doesn't start?  Bought a bunch of lemons.  Yeah.  Now, come on.  I heard you guys talking about the old, yesterday on the show, the old days, the Jimmy Jackson  days.  You know?  Colin, you remember?  Colin remembers Ray Ramagoom.  Jerry's, you know, one of those, like, Anthony's, you know, Grape to Wrath family that moved 
[02:21:00]  out to the West Coast.  Grape to Wrath.  Those are fine cars.  And by the way, when I heard Patrice on yesterday philosophically rambling, I literally was spitting  my teeth out of my mouth.  I really had it with his.  Yeah, you know, it's funny.  He's, like, musing.  Him and Norton.  Ticketing.  What really got you about that whole thing? 
[02:21:30]  What really got you, here's what gets me in general.  I think Bob is guilty of it, too, probably, but I can't remember offhand.  In the past two years, I've heard both Patrice and Norton experts go, that was good radio.  As opposed to this.  Hey, you want to read?  Shut the fuck up.  What do you know on good radio, you phony little fake half radio guys?  Not a lot.  We put you on.  No, it's the same joke in two minutes.  Of course. 
[02:22:00]  Well, deliver it, too.  Sitcom.  Sitcom?  Hold on.  Another thing you know nothing about.  What a lovely movie.  Give us a stronger line for the out on that, would you?  Why?  I thought it was pretty good, Morty.  I don't know.  Hey, Jimmy, you got the Esther letter still?  Oh, no, it's over at CBS.  Oh, fuck.  What did she call him?  There was a woman named Esther who writes us sometimes, and she was critiquing your appearance  in the Sarah Silverman biography, and she was noticing.  My appearance? 
[02:22:30]  Yeah.  She critiqued.  You like my outrage?  Yeah, I know.  My appearance?  She critiqued the.  She critiqued the fact that you've put on a few metric tons.  A few LBs.  Well, you can't sue her for slander, that's for sure.  That's funny.  That's good radio.  That came on so much livelier than when Bob was on, and he actually seriously pushed me  in this conversation.  Bob fucking.  Bob was getting so ignored, he fucking turned around and opened his asshole. 
[02:23:00]  on Pal Talk.  The same thing he would do as a boy for attention.  Well, now that's it.  Hey, Colin.  Hey, Colin.  Keep talking.  What's that, Bob?  Oh, you just.  I'm talking to Colin.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  He's trying to call.  He's trying to call me the Queen of England.  Hey, Colin.  Do you remember when Ray Romano used to do props at the end of his show?  No. 
[02:23:30]  What's that?  Norton used to do them.  No, I wouldn't.  Yeah, you did.  You're a profect.  You're a profect.  I would.  Get the enema bag in the parachute pants.  Oh, that's right.  I forgot about that.  Wait, what's that bit, Jimmy?  You forgot about the four minutes, five years you started.  My, uh, the enema joke I used to do.  I used to have an enema bag on stage?  It was an enema in a box, a fleet enema.  And it was in a brown paper baggie.  And I would talk about how enemas are addicting.  And then I would do this thing about an enema junkie.  It was fucking.  Oh, no, you didn't. 
[02:24:00]  I hope you guys laugh.  I had to buy this thing, you know, just muscling it and overly eager.  Muscling it.  Oh, you've never seen a fucking more muscled piece of material.  Yeah, there was also a message at the end of the act like, hey, you know, addiction's a serious problem, you know?  It's not true.  You ended it by going, we all have addictions we have to look at.  That's all I'm trying to say.  Good night.  All I'm trying to say is that love don't have to say.  Do me a fair, don't lump me in with stupid Voss.  I have 14 years, 8 hours, and 10 minutes without a drink or a drug in my body. 
[02:24:30]  It's really horrendous.  Going for the cheap applause at every show.  Well, in all fairness.  22 years sober.  With Voss, addiction is a problem and diction is a problem.  Lawn of the day.  But he's not saying, look, I'm sober.  It's the fucking dramatic way he sets it up without a drink or a drug in my body.  Like, wow, it really is a temple, isn't it?  Yeah, that's great.  Right.  He's always ex-archaholics.  He's always braving.  Fucking hippie hop on his kidney. 
[02:25:00]  What, Carl?  No, it just all looks good now.  How about the other day when he hit Keith in the kidney?  I can't believe there was like a mini race war going on at your pilot taping.  Yeah, God, the word got out fast about that.  Keith gave Voss a beating.  I was talking to Keith a day later and he goes, I think, oh, Voss is on the other line.  Voss called him up.  He's not satisfied.  This is like a serious thing going on.  Yeah, but Voss thinks he actually threw a legitimate karate kick.  And he's fucking, he jumped like an inch off the ground and he's kneeing to bend fully. 
[02:25:30]  I told you 10,000 garbage cans can't be wrong.  When Voss had a kick.  Yeah, Keith was trying to break about it the other night.  You know where Keith is right now?  He's on a fucking plane to Alaska to open for Wanda.  Really?  Yeah, that fucking lackey.  Is he really?  No, he certainly is.  He really is just an old fucking Negro.  It's cold up here, Wanda.  You got a problem?  No, I'm just saying it's actually refreshing. 
[02:26:00]  I remember me and Wanda opening for Keith in Newark one time.  So happy that fucking flip-flopped.  That fucking Robinson.  That's the best.  Yeah.  Fucking worm.  All right, we got to take a break, guys.  Bye, Kyle.  Bye, Bobby.  All right, gentlemen.  Take care.  Hey, Bobby, the Comedy Central special is tonight.  Let's make sure people check that out for you.  Wait, don't hit Kyle.  Call, call him.  We lose Colin?  He's gone.  Yeah, he got him up.  God damn it.  Bobby, can you call Colin back for one second, please?  Hang on.  For real, yeah.  All right.  And Bobby's going to come in Tuesday, so we can really push his CD slash DVD. 
[02:26:30]  Colin.  Yo.  Hey, it's Norton.  I had, I, before we got the phone, I don't like you trying to interfere with my friendship  with Jerry, by the way.  Oh.  What happened?  Interfere with what friendship?  Jerry didn't even, I swear to God, Norton came up to me and he goes, hey, Jerry, like  peers, you know, like, hey, what's up, Jerry?  Like, I haven't seen Jerry in a few years.  Well, I'm sorry, I'm not his mechanic, like you.  He feels like Jerry. 
[02:27:00]  Like, this kid's really, like, this kid's really moving.  Jerry goes, hey.  Like that.  No.  Hey.  No.  Here's what happened.  Like, I knew he didn't recognize his name.  And then Larry, you don't even know his name.  He goes, yes, I do.  James.  He had had an accident that day.  He's at the cellar and he's talking to Colin.  So I walk over and go, hi, Jerry.  And he went, hey, Jim.  And Colin comes over.  No, he did it.  I heard him.  He said, hey.  Quiet.  So Colin walks over and he goes, after Jerry was on stage, because he bumped Colin two nights  in a row.  Because he knows who to bump.  No, I told him.  Shut your mouth.  You didn't.  And if you would have said, not bump me, he would have bumped you anyway. 
[02:27:30]  So fucking Colin was fucking bumped.  No, he could have.  Shut up.  You were bumped.  You stepped aside.  And then Colin comes up.  Shut up.  And he goes, Jerry didn't even remember your fucking name.  He did remember my name.  He knows my name.  By the way, Jimmy is saying all this with egg hanging off his chin.  Yeah, I know.  I didn't want to say it.  Is that what it was?  It was a bit of melted cheese and egg and omelet.  Egg on his face.  It costs it literally.  Right.  No, but I resent you trying to interfere with this relationship. 
[02:28:00]  This budding relationship.  Every time Jerry and I.  No, I just didn't like the fact.  First of all, last night, you know, Kurt Metzger.  Yeah.  I shouldn't even mention his name on an actual, you know, an airwave anyway, because he said  nothing.  But last night he came over to me and he, like, Jerry was there.  I'm talking to Jerry.  He comes by and touches my shoulder, hey, Carl, and walks by.  And I could tell he'd practice it outside on, like, a fence, like, three times.  He'd have been there to come by.  Because he wanted you to introduce him to Jerry?  No, no.  He just wanted me to go, hey, Kurt, as he walked by. 
[02:28:30]  Did you?  He didn't even stop.  Hey, Colin, did you?  Did I meet you last night?  I was there.  I don't know.  Who is this guy?  Colin Quinn?  Yeah.  Is he important?  Not really.  No.  It's Jim Jefferies.  He's a little bit of Jefferies.  He's a comic from England.  Really?  Yeah, he's like Jim Norton, except with an accent.  Really?  And without fucking egg hanging off me chin.  Edgy, hey, why don't you go back to the Edinburgh Festival and run that shit by somebody  else?  How about Jefferies?  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  That was really harsh. 
[02:29:00]  I didn't know that you had bitter comics in this country as well.  Oh.  Oh, oh.  What the hell do you think?  He said that you were bitter.  Hang on.  Stop for a second.  Colin, put that phone to your good ear.  Oh, he's tearing him up.  Let me explain something about Bob.  Yeah.  Me and Bob are both guilty of being so fat that some of those are toward each other, and one of  the other loses him, and it's our fat, our neck fat, hangs up on ourselves.  And both of us have had to have to do with us. 
[02:29:30]  So don't just blame me, fatso.  You should be in a hollowed out palm tree canoe playing a ukulele.  All right, Quinn, you are funny.  I'll give you that, man.  You look like every character on Dr. Seuss.  No, he got you, Killian.  That wasn't bad, Bob.  Under normal circumstances, that would have been amusing.  But after a hollowed out canoe playing ukulele, you got to fucking just come back from that 
[02:30:00]  one.  Yeah, just cover up and take the hit.  You should have given a little rest period there, Rich Boss, instead of going, I got  to top this one.  All right, we got to let everyone go.  We got to take a break here.  So, yeah, so, Carl, please, let's, you know.  Carl, when are you coming in?  What?  When are you coming in?  I'll come in, uh, I'm coming anytime next week.  How about Tuesday?  Yeah, come in Tuesday.  We're going to, we're going to have a little party for Bob Kelly because he's got his DVD  slash CD coming out. 
[02:30:30]  Oh, that's right.  All right, cool.  That's nice.  So come on in Tuesday.  We'll have a little fun.  I love the party in there.  Why not?  Hey, today, uh, Colin, uh, you'd, you'd be proud.  We had everyone smelling, uh, Big A's, uh, tongue scraping gook.  Bobby, you missed a good one, pal.  There's people vomiting.  It's horrible.  Yeah, Bobby.  Yeah, really bad.  I love Big A.  Yeah, he's, uh, Big A, they love you.  I have a dream.  I think, actually, I'd like to see Big A wearing Lady Di and Marion's hair and being on John Adams. 
[02:31:00]  God damn, is that good.  I forgot that Colin's obsessed with the retarded Laverne Shirley.  Yeah.  Back in the day, you were just obsessed with those two.  Oh, he could rip them apart.  All right, Colin, you probably have, he's trying to hang up the phone for the last ten minutes  or at your chatty Cathy.  That's all good.  Colin, come on.  You know, I'm trying to help Norton with his career.  If you could have just seen him, though, leaning over to Jerry like, fuck this, now we equals. 
[02:31:30]  Hey, Jerry.  No, I didn't know, Jerry.  Well, somebody's been in the business.  Did he call him Jer?  I said, hey, Jerry.  No, he was just like, hey, Jerry.  But he looked at him like, hey, it's not fucking, there's no fear.  And then Jerry just go, like, that thing he does where he goes, oh, hi.  And then Colin begs to mention this.  Hey.  Oh, yeah.  Colin begs to mention this.  He's like, I know him, but who the fuck is he?  No, no, no.  That's a pack of lies.  Colin understands that Jerry and I were probably very close, and it fucking threatens him.  Because Colin was on stage, Jerry went on again last night at the cellar, and then Colin went on after, 
[02:32:00]  which is called being bumped.  And Jerry stayed to watch, probably to be polite.  Like, yeah, he's going to help push my car.  No, he knows him a long time.  I was kidding.  And Colin's not really a mechanic.  Oh, they're friends.  They're friends.  Colin, I'm trying to, you know.  And so I'm standing there watching, like, the last five minutes of Colin's acting.  I was just very fucking funny.  And so right after Colin finishes up, Jerry, I didn't know was still in the room, walks out. 
[02:32:30]  And he says, hey.  And he says to me, are you coming up?  Like, am I going to come up and sit?  And I was like, yeah, I am.  But then I talked to Colin for a minute and decided to go home because I got a text from my girl, and I was late.  Oh.  So you know what, Colin?  I might have went up last night, but I was afraid.  I didn't want to steal the whole show.  I'm like, you know what?  Colin means a lot to him.  So I went home.  Wow.  No, the best was some guy in the audience walks out of the show.  Norton had just been on a couple of comedians ago and hands him his receipt because he realizes you can't be a full-time guy. 
[02:33:00]  He just hands the receipt to Norton and Norton goes, hey, I go, I saw you, and hands him the receipt.  Like, I hope you're taking receipts to let people out because you're not a full-time stand-up.  I think I was the doorman who fucking probably sang for my supper.  Yeah, just did a few minutes.  All right, well.  Okay, Colin, does anyone like Jerry Seinfeld?  I do.  I love him.  I love him.  I think he's hysterical.  You know what?  No, I didn't say it right.  Does Jerry Seinfeld like anybody? 
[02:33:30]  Oh.  I know who he doesn't like.  Oh, Bobby?  Yo.  I actually was on stage one time, and I was on for like two minutes.  I get the wrap-up sign.  They're telling me to get the hell off.  Get off.  So I'm thinking somebody famous is there.  I get off stage.  He's sitting there.  This is after the not-you shit.  I actually waved to him.  He stared right through me.  Oh.  He just doesn't.  He didn't even acknowledge my way.  He doesn't want any part of you. 
[02:34:00]  What did Jerry like the most is people like Bob trying to win him over, probably.  Well, we-  You can't do that with him.  Anthony and I have met him twice, and both times we got to.  Oh.  Oh.  I had that like 20 times with-  He doesn't like dirty comedy, does he?  I had that like 20-  I don't know who he likes.  He kind of wrinkles his nose a little.  His lip goes up, and he goes, oh.  Right, right, right.  Like, oh, you two.  He's added a lot to comedy.  His fucking Bumblebee movie was so fucking prolific. 
[02:34:30]  Prolific?  Prolific.  It doesn't really make sense, Bob.  Prolific means a lot of, like, stuff to put out.  Yeah, a lot of-  There'll be Bumblebee and other bucks.  It'll be profound, or-  Dude, you know what it is, man.  He's so arrogant, dude.  He thinks he's got the market cornered there, but that Bumblebee movie, shut up.  I didn't like the Bumblebee movie.  I love that Norton gives me shit about that, but when you see him at the cellar during the  week working out new stuff, he's like a fucking, you know, 18th century French poet.  Hey, well, fuck the comedy thing. 
[02:35:00]  He's turning the automotive world on its head.  That's right.  And at least I'm doing it in front of an audience and not my mirror, you fucking zilch.  You know what, dude?  Just once, Bob wants someone to say to him, God, man, you're a smart dude.  I didn't think of that.  You've never heard that in fucking 35 years.  Every time you've said something you thought was interesting, people went, we know already.  We know.  We get it.  Bob wanted to just sit there and talk to him probably about the accident.  You know, hey, Jerry, what happened there?  You know, how did the car roll over? 
[02:35:30]  And he's just looking right through you.  Here's how pathetic I am.  His dream is to have Jerry go, hey, not as bad as that accident I saw you have on Torgasm.  Woof.  Dude, the fucking car's flipped.  That was a great move, dude.  Yeah, you're absolutely right, Bob.  Thanks for helping me.  That's never going to happen.  He's never going to be moved by anything you say unless you just leave and he'll go, good, 
[02:36:00]  that thing is out of my way.  That thing.  That fucking space taker is gone.  I met him like 20 times.  He's going to be like, good, that giant adobe building that was standing in front of you.  What are you talking about?  You fat fuck.  I sent him a Christmas present.  You sent him a Christmas present?  He's already got a lot of shit.  I know.  I couldn't resist.  Wow.  What did you send him?  I was in Vegas.  Airplane meal?  And what year was this?  This is a few months ago. 
[02:36:30]  If it's 89, I'll respect you.  Oh, okay.  Oh, boy.  I've met Seinfeld a million times, but you don't really meet him.  You know, it's like he knows who you are, but now I'm in Vegas and he's for the festival  and I'm opening for Chris Rock, so Seinfeld's there.  He's on the late show.  It's like, you know, Caesar's Palace.  It couldn't be cooler.  Me and Rock are wearing suits, you know, a big show.  And I have Buddy Hackett's hanky in my suit, like, you know, for good luck.  So Seinfeld comes up to me afterwards.  He goes, hey, good set.  I like your hanky and your thing. 
[02:37:00]  And then the next night, I came back out of a different suit with a different hanky.  And he's commenting to me again.  He goes, good set.  And I like that one.  I go, this one was my dad's.  Next day, I'm having lunch.  We're walking to the forum shops.  Me and Rock, he calls Seinfeld.  So now the two of them are like, it's like, you know, Hope and Crosby walking to the forum  shops.  You can imagine what that looks like.  So we go to lunch and I'm like, oh, my God, this is Jerry Seinfeld telling me, hanging  out with me.  So we walk back, say goodbye.  We look at some sneakers and it's no big deal.  I feel like we had like a little thing.  You had a little connection, sure. 
[02:37:30]  So a month goes by.  I'm in Beverly Hills.  I run into Jerry's manager, George Shapiro, the little guy.  He had bought lunch.  I go, hey, thanks again for lunch.  And I just start thinking about that moment.  I get a block later and I see like a men's, you know, haberdashery, fancy store.  So I went and I bought him a little blue hanky.  Oh, my God.  Why didn't you just suck up to the celebrity?  He's my favorite.  He's not a celebrity.  He's a great comic.  I feel like I learned a lot from him.  I'm a good comic. 
[02:38:00]  Buy me a fucking hanky, bitch.  Like, seriously.  Bitch.  So then, so then, so then here's, it gets worse.  So I don't hear anything now.  It's like.  I was a muffler the other day.  What's that?  Nothing.  Go ahead.  There I see the lovely Mrs. Seinfeld.  Is she a nice boot?  Yeah.  Very, very sweet.  Very beautiful.  Very friendly.  And of all people, my neighbor, Sarah Jessica Parker goes, you know, Jeff Ross, the comedian. 
[02:38:30]  And she goes, the comedian.  I was like, oh, my God.  Maybe he got the hanky.  You know, like, she knows who I am.  So I go, hey, I sent Jerry Seinfeld this hanky for Hanukkah.  And she looks at me like, what?  Oh.  Oh.  And she was just like, no idea.  It was just like, I just put my hanky.  What do you think he did?  Even if he got it, do you think he opened it up and went, honey, you have to see this?  Honey, come here, look at the hanky.  Did you leave it?  Did you leave a little note? 
[02:39:00]  Yeah, I wrote a nice note.  Do you remember our moments?  I wrote a nice note thanking him for lunch and stuff.  Here's a hanky.  I've used it.  Oh, it's like a $100 silk thing, you know?  Probably wiped off one of his Porsches before he went out.  You know when you get a hanky.  I feel like it's my only chance to ever connect with it.  He probably used it as a comrade.  Or he'll send it back to you with a fucking stool saying, put these two together, you  know what to do.  Or even worse, just wiped his dipstick after he checked his oil and just tossed it in this  expensive garbage pile. 
[02:39:30]  It's fucking full of hankies.  Whenever you watch him on TV, do you always check the pocket to see if there's a blue hanky?  I haven't lately.  You know, you watch it, you go, he's got to wear it one day.  That's my hanky.  He loves the hanky.  Pacino's card got more respect in Donnie Brasco.  Take care of that hanky, he's got a double meaning, you know what I mean? 
[02:40:00]  Unbelievable.  I thought I was being like Sammy Davis Jr.  What other faggy gifts are you going to be?  He's a blonde Jewish.  In both senses of his ethnicity.  All right.  We really have to take a break, guys.  It was Frankie.  It was good.  I'll tell you.  I'll show you.  You can't get racist because there's an English guy on the show.  Let me explain to you, English man.  You're going to see it soon enough.  Let me explain it.  Let me explain it to you.  I'm Australian, you dick.  Is that James Smith?  No, it's Jim.  That's Jim Jeffreys. 
[02:40:30]  Well, come on.  Who's number 61?  All right.  Who's number one?  You want to fill in for the other one.  Jeffreys is getting some buzz today.  He's number 61 on Google Trends for some reason.  Google Trends.  What's that?  Maybe it's another Jim Jeffreys.  No, there's only me and the heavyweight boxer.  He's named after the fighter.  Yeah, yeah.  There's a fighter called Jim Jeffreys.  I'm not more popular than the guy from the 1920s.  Like, fuck.  There's not even footage of the cunt fighting.  You've got to think that I get more YouTube hits than a guy where there's no footage. 
[02:41:00]  Hold on.  Hold on.  Just when you thought we couldn't have enough comedians on the show at one time, we say  hi to Jay Moore.  Jay!  Well, first of all, you know, it's Colin.  Hi, Colin.  Oh, Colin.  You know, that's really good.  Jim Norton, Caroline, trying to sleep with a weakness from Eau Claire, Wisconsin.  Telling your palates every weekend.  Guess what, Mom?  I'm on Broadway.  I like to throw a bone to the shop.  Just, you know, I don't know how much we like taxation without representation. 
[02:41:30]  That's good.  What a zilch.  Working around.  Look at me.  I'm magnanimous.  I'm from the first of all.  Don't help everyone.  Fuckin' Jay.  That is my favorite impression anyone does of anyone.  Calm down, dummy.  Jimmy Norton, all of a sudden, is like, you know, they're dancing with the stars, like,  the big judge, the big old British guy, telling him how good they are. 
[02:42:00]  That was a very good joke, Jimmy.  I like your lines, and don't forget to straighten your legs next time.  Let's go, that joke.  Okay.  He does a perfect fuckin' Colin.  He's like Colin with better lines.  I can't tell which one's which.  He's like Colin's midget hand.  He gives me money. 
[02:42:30]  You're all scarred from chewing on him.  Creep.  He's like, oh, yeah, you're gonna whack that.  You're the whole four-man.  It's Jim Jefferies gay.  Who's gay?  Who's gay?  Who's gay?  Who's a bonnet and a spank?  Hey.  Hey, Colin.  Hey, Colin, do you have anything to say to the other Colin?  I can't.  I can barely hear it, but I know it was...  Oh, jeez.  That age is a bitch.  Fucking great.  Why don't you go back to your book, stupid? 
[02:43:00]  That is a good impersonation.  That's amazing.  This great white hope.  Colin sits around on his typewriter with his blinking cursor waiting for the world to end  for either excuse or not finish.  Blinking cursor.  Well, I was on the third act and the big meteorite and took out my apartment only.  That's great.  I had the British guy rolling in the aisles.  This is the British guy.  Hiya, boys.  Hey, look at Jeff Ross.  At the big boy table. 
[02:43:30]  What's up, Colin?  Oh, goddamn, Jay.  Oh, very good.  Fucking right on the money.  Fucking Jay's impressions.  God damn, man.  How are you guys doing?  Very good, Mr. Moore.  I'd like to say hi to Mr. Jeffries.  I watched your video on YouTube this week.  I enjoyed it very much.  Are you me getting punched in the head or an actual clip of me doing stand-up?  No, I saw the punch in the head one.  Well, that's old news to me.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's fun though, isn't it?  I'm a big fan of your head punch also. 
[02:44:00]  Yeah, Jim's a pisser, man.  And Jimmy Norton, where are you performing this weekend?  Just hanging in the city.  Oh, way to plug yourself, Tim.  That's good.  You could have always said, you know, I'll be with Bobby Kelly, feeding him donuts.  I'll be with you on the show.  I'll be with you on the show.  God, he looks like.  Portly.  George Michael. 
[02:44:30]  I would know Bob Kelly trying to quantify his fat, telling us how hard it is, because  he's Irish.  Jesus.  Jesus.  This is hard fat.  It's just like my dance fat.  It's very hard.  It's very good for me.  This is hard fat.  This muscle isn't that fast.  Keep fucking this school.  We have to get on stage next.  Act one.  Fuck school.  Say hello to everybody. 
[02:45:00]  Call back.  We're all having a good time.  Forget all that stuff in between.  Oh, I got the wife.  I'll fuck the school.  Good night.  They're going to fuck a sink fucker and a school fucker.  Can you hear this?  All the stools and furniture tested regularly.  Because that stupid, drunken Irishman.  Holy shit.  Sitting there like a defeated Walter Matthau. 
[02:45:30]  Hey, that's not fair.  Wait for Fred Roman to die.  If there was someone to talk about it.  You really do look like Walter Matthau.  There we go.  Jesus Christ.  I just rolled over to take a leak and I clung you guys.  Jay Moore.  Awesome.  Take care, Jay.  You're fucking pissing, man.  Don't forget what Forrest Whitaker told me.  What? 
[02:46:00]  Whatever.  I act.  Jimmy Norton.  It never seems to come out all at once.  I didn't hear you.  Exactly.  Exactly.  All right.  We lost Jay Moore.  He's fucking funny.  That cunt, man.  Absolutely.  He's one of the best fucking guys on the phone ever.  Perfect.  He's hysterical.  He's hysterical.  Holy shit, Colin.  It's like he studied you.  Yeah.  He has.  I know.  It's really...  It wouldn't take that long.  All right.  We got to say goodbye to everyone because we got to take a break. 
[02:46:30]  Bob Kelly.  We'll see you Tuesday.  Colin, come in with Bob Kelly Tuesday.  We got to celebrate Bobby's DVD slash CD release on Tuesday.  No, CD.  He calls it.  He didn't say CD.  CD.  CD.  CD.  CD.  CD.  All right.  Are you tired of hearing about his CD?  Yes.  I am also fed up with this.  It's called Just a Tip.  And then Bobby's got his Comedy Central special tonight, too.  Wow.  Yeah.  All right, guys.  We got to take a break.  All right, gentlemen.  Bye, boys.  All right, guys.  I let him. 
[02:47:00]  I let him.  All right, man.  Love you, Colin.  Damn it. </pre>
