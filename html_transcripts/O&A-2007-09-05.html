<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often transitioning abruptly between them.  The show began with Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton complaining about unproductive meetings dominated by sales pitches, hindering their creative process.  This led to a discussion of their ongoing conflicts with management, specifically program director Tracy and agent Bob Eatman, who consistently delivered bad news. The fallout from using a Fox News sound stinger, threatening legal action, was a significant point of discussion.  Whoopi Goldberg’s recent appearance on *The View*, her defense of Michael Vick, and a past phone interview where she hung up on them were also discussed at length, with considerable debate about the appropriateness of her cultural defense of Vick's dog fighting.  This segment included discussions of E-Rock’s tardiness, a "Whip Them Out Wednesday" segment, listener calls, staff vacation anecdotes (including one involving a breakup), and Jerry Lewis’s apology for using a homophobic slur, coupled with a recounting of his past controversial statements.  The hosts frequently used expletives and sexually suggestive language throughout this section.

The show continued with a news story prompting speculation about offensive words, with hosts suggesting "retard" and a far worse word, comparing potential consequences to those faced by Imus.  The conversation then veered to Senator Larry Craig’s restroom incident, filled with ribald speculation about his sexuality and the "wide stance" defense.  Anecdotes and jokes about bathroom encounters and coded sexual signals were shared by the hosts and Jim Norton, including a Patrice O’Neal anecdote.  Further discussion of Craig’s potential resignation and reconsideration followed, interspersed with jokes.  This led into more vacation anecdotes: one host punching a light pole, another discussing humorous photos with Disney characters, and a lengthy account of Than's heated confrontation with his mother in Nantucket, during which he called her a sociopath, detailing a strained relationship stemming from his parents' divorce and accusations of verbal abuse.  Adam Ferrara called in to promote *Rescue Me*, and there were discussions about Anthony Cumia’s planned seminar on gay bathroom sex, Anthony's gambling habits and green-screen setup, and Jim Norton's breakup, which unfolded during the show.  Several unresolved vacation anecdotes were left for another time.

The next segment began with a comparison of therapists and strippers, focusing on their perceived lack of genuine interest in their clients/patrons. This transitioned to Opie and Jim Norton's personal lives, including Opie's contentious relationship with his girlfriend and Jim Norton’s exploits.  The show announced Seth Green as an upcoming guest, but he was unable to appear.  Instead, E-Rock’s engagement at Disney World was revealed, followed by Opie’s unexpected announcement of his own engagement.  A phone call with Rob Bartlett promoted his stand-up gigs. The final part of this segment focused on the hosts' frustrations with their iPhones, AT&T service, and Apple products, resulting in a torrent of vulgar and insulting language directed at AT&T and Steve Jobs.  This segment included complaints about the operating system and technical support, punctuated by profanity, and concluded with a humorous pre-recorded bit with Matt Besser.  Listener calls and emails were briefly addressed throughout.

A chaotic segment followed, starting with technical difficulties and a humorous anecdote about vinegar and a horse.  This led to a discussion of a listener's relationship problems, described in graphic detail.  Notable calls included an irate caller trying to cancel his AOL account and a frustrated caller attempting to turn off his mother's Dell laptop, both resulting in extended and heated exchanges with customer service representatives. A pre-recorded bit about a disastrous AOL cancellation call was played. Other topics included the disappearance of a millionaire pilot (speculated to be dead), John McCain’s age and fitness for office, ABC news anchors inappropriately laughing during a report on Owen Wilson's suicide attempt (with the hosts finding humor in the irony due to the uncle's name, "Ho Wilson"), Fox News gaffes, and a discussion of Scientology, including a host's anecdote about visiting Scientology headquarters.  This segment concluded with more listener calls and a discussion about E-Rock’s engagement and the hosts’ opinions on marriage. Adam Ferrara was in the studio throughout this segment.

The final segment heavily criticized Keith Olbermann’s perceived lack of journalistic integrity, focusing on his criticism of Don Imus while remaining silent about other controversial figures like Rush Limbaugh.  The hosts used highly offensive language ("douche," "prick," "faggot") to describe Olbermann and expressed anger towards George W. Bush, again using highly offensive language.  Rita Cosby's tell-all book was discussed, along with crude jokes about her voice and the book's content. A discussion of a B-52 bomber mistakenly carrying nuclear warheads was interspersed with jokes about lap dances and bachelor parties.  Adam Carolla was a guest, contributing to the discussion. The show concluded by playing Andy Samberg's "Dick in a Box," with a custom intro.  Numerous sexually explicit and offensive jokes were made throughout this segment.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio shop jobs.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their options.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why?  Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good.  Go screw! 
[00:00:30]  Radio bad boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony.  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio shop jobs, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Shop jobs, Opie and Anthony.  Shop jobs, Opie and Anthony.  Radio shop jobs, Opie and Anthony.  I go into her room and there are panties on the floor.  Oh, you're getting creepy.  I had to pick up the panties and put them on.  I can't believe he said that!  I don't even know something.  Opie and Anthony.  Catch up a baseball. 
[00:01:00]  Oh, nice.  Oh, that was mad.  I didn't hit him hard enough.  Opie and Anthony.  Terry Schiavo, I loved you in the grudge.  Will you be doing more voiceover work?  This is the worst show I've ever done.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Running palaver free now, I guess. 
[00:01:30]  I believe so, yes.  Good morning.  Hi.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Jim Norton.  Whip them out Wednesday.  Phone number 877-212-ONA.  It's such an easy phone number.  Isn't it?  Finally.  Used to be a bunch of numbers.  We're actually trying to figure crap out around here.  Make the number easier. 
[00:02:00]  Yeah, figure it all out.  Not cursing thing, everything.  I didn't curse.  It was close.  No, that was close.  You can get away with short selling the S word.  The F word never gets short sold.  The second you try it, it just...  Once you work yourself past the U, you're done.  I don't know what happened on vacation.  Well, you cursed a lot.  Yes.  I think the Philly crew rubbed off on me, because now I just want to curse all the time.  It's Whip Them Out Wednesday, yes, of course. 
[00:02:30]  We'll get into that a little later.  What else is it today?  Oh, no.  Cat Noise Wednesday, possibly.  No.  Butt Rub Wednesday.  I think those two are losing steam.  Yeah.  Both of those losing steam.  They're ready to go away and be replaced with something new.  Obviously, you've got to replace them with something new, because I think the only people  that were rubbing butts were Jimmy and E-Rock.  Yeah.  I don't really want to see that anymore, like I wanted to at some point anymore.  It's getting old.  But it was kind of hot at one point, though, because I've got to tell you, it's warm up. 
[00:03:00]  What?  It was what?  It was something sexy about it, and it's not even gay, but his ass is just warm.  Oh, okay.  All right.  It is cold in the morning.  It's also can't say that Wednesday.  Can't say that Wednesday.  Yeah, you know, we'll get one or two callers.  All right, and you're like, hey, hey.  Hey, you can't say that.  Hey.  Hey, of our days of the week.  It's better than taking fake phone calls. 
[00:03:30]  Ooh.  That was fun yesterday, wasn't it?  Oh.  Exposing Howie.  I listened to the replay.  Very enlightening.  For taking a lot of fake phone calls over the years to get his phones to ring.  Oh, my God.  Half his really outrageous phone calls were fake.  Yeah, they come from a service.  Anyway, speaking of phone calls, Anthony, let's start with doom and gloom.  Doom and gloom.  Super Agent Bob Eatman.  You know, this is such a fun job.  It is.  You come in.  You get to talk with your pals for a while. 
[00:04:00]  And besides the time on the air, everything else sucks about this job.  And a lot of people, they think we have the best job in the world.  It is.  For the most part, we do.  When you're hearing us, it is absolutely, there is not a better job when you are hearing  our voices through whatever bits of technology you're using to capture this show.  But just like your job, there's always somebody around to just wreck it and take whatever little  fun there is in your job away. 
[00:04:30]  And screw it up.  Even in radio, they take most of the fun away.  So even when we get in here, you know, 5 o'clock, talking before the show, it's still  fun hanging out in the office with the boys, get to make some jokes off the air so we can,  you know, get into some stuff we can't do on the air.  We do that privately in the office.  And then 6 o'clock is showtime.  And we have fun.  And then by 11, 11.30, sometimes, you know, 11.45, whatever, the show's over. 
[00:05:00]  And let the hell begin.  That is what is left of this job.  Meetings.  It's a Congo line of meetings.  Just meetings.  Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun,  of people that are just like angry about something.  Yeah.  Something, whatever, you're doing something that's just pissing someone off.  Sales meetings.  Oh, meetings, meetings, meetings.  Inclusion meetings.  So, yesterday, we had a... 
[00:05:30]  Meetings with corporate.  It was a quick Steve walking meeting.  I call them walking meetings because he's got to babble out what he's got written on his sheet  before we walk out of the studio.  We start slowly walking as he's talking.  We don't take Steve meetings seriously.  And the panic sets in with Steve because he knows he has from this studio to the elevator.  Oh, my goodness.  I have seconds.  Guys, we've been pitched a guest. 
[00:06:00]  Guys, there's a sales pitch.  Guys, is this good time for you to...  Where did they go?  Well, I guess sales is pissed off at us here in New York.  Yeah.  Because they turned our programming meeting into a sales meeting.  Yeah, yeah.  We decided at some point that we were going to take a day of the week.  And after the show, we were going to sit in the office, again, with no brass, no bull crap.  Just the guys involved with the show.  Be careful with what you're about to say because a lot of our listeners might drive off the road 
[00:06:30]  when they hear what you're about to say.  They might fall down, actually, as they get ready for work.  I know.  But this was a logic.  Strap in.  Strap in.  We were going to get everybody together from the show, just the show staff, go into the office  and talk about what we can do on the show.  You know, show prep.  Kind of just bad ideas around.  Oh, my God.  Wait a minute.  I hear cars screeching and hitting trees and poles.  We decided after being back on radio for three years that it might be a good idea to do a little show prepping 
[00:07:00]  once a week.  Once a week.  After the show, just to knock around some ideas.  If someone has an idea that isn't quite gelled, you know, you hang out with the rest of the  guys, we start talking about it, and we get an idea, and it's like, hey, let's work on  that.  Let's get that working.  So that's what this turned or started out as.  In a matter of a couple of weeks, it turned into one salesperson coming in.  It was brought to our attention as Steve goes, do you mind if Will stops into the meeting 
[00:07:30]  just to give you a little idea of what's going on in sales?  Like, sure, no problem.  And at the time, it was no problem.  Fast forward a mere few months.  We have a freaking line of salespeople in our office once a week ready to just rattle off  a million things.  And that's what this meeting that was supposed to be us talking about the show and getting  show prep done, it turned into sales pitches.  Yeah.  They come in and go, we have such and such a sponsor. 
[00:08:00]  They want involvement in the show.  Is there a way we can fit this in?  Can you guys do an appearance here, and it'll be sponsored by this and that?  So then we sit there and go, I got to get out of here.  Right.  And we leave without having discussed anything creative about the program.  So our creative meeting turned into a sales meeting.  Turned into a goddamn sales meeting.  So now that we're back from vacation, we're readjusting here, and we said, no more sales  meetings.  No more.  So now they're mad at us.  They're mad.  And then Tracy, the PD here in New York, is mad. 
[00:08:30]  Tracy's mad because we can't find time for Tracy.  She wants to meet with us, and I'm like, look, it's a tough week, which it truly is.  A lot of stuff's going on.  My brother's getting married Sunday.  You know, the owner of FH Riley's.  Of course.  Of, you know, Huntington Village there, 400 New York Avenue.  He's getting married Sunday.  They have a very good cheesecake.  They sure do, Jimmy.  My sister makes that cheesecake.  Did you shove it in your face?  I took the fork.  I didn't even put it in the cheesecake.  I scooped it under it.  I just opened and went. 
[00:09:00]  Yeah.  Fantastic.  Isn't it great?  So she's mad because I wrote back, it's a tough week.  I don't know if we can meet.  And then we found, like, we're going to squeeze in, like, a 10-minute meeting in between shows  today.  Yeah.  We were trying to, like, you know.  And she was insulted.  She was like, every week's a tough week for everybody.  Yes.  So then I went, all right, now you challenged me.  And I love a challenge.  So then I emailed her back our entire schedule where there's meetings every effing day, even  though I said this is a week where I got to leave right away because I got a lot of things 
[00:09:30]  to do for my brother's wedding.  I got tuxes to fit into.  I got haircuts that need to be done.  Everyone knows pre-wedding stuff is ridiculous.  I got a rehearsal dinner tomorrow night, so I got to leave immediately after the show.  Yeah.  So then I had to write back to her, look, look, I wouldn't just say it's a tough week.  Here's my schedule.  Our schedule.  Okay?  We're not lying about time.  What do you think?  We go tra-la-la skipping through the streets after the show. 
[00:10:00]  Right.  It's meeting after meeting.  And then if we don't have time for a meeting, we don't have time.  Right.  We're going to Philly next week.  So that's a whole thing with a lot of meetings involved with that.  And that's great.  If I got to stay in New York City until five o'clock rush hour and drive home so I can go  to bed miserable and wake up miserable.  Yeah.  I'm not going to stay here until 5 p.m.  And that's the key.  In the end, it affects the show.  Right.  Because we get miserable. 
[00:10:30]  And the show is paramount by being weighed down by all these stupid meetings.  Steve, we don't need you.  Right.  We're just trashing the salespeople and you don't need to defend them.  Oh, Steve.  They will filter everything through you.  And then you will bring us the better ideas and then we'll get back to them.  That's what we do now.  Now that's how we run things.  That's right.  And if anyone has a problem with that, they could talk to our agent, super agent, Bob  Eatman.  Yes.  Mr. Doom and Gloom.  That's where this all comes around. 
[00:11:00]  I got a call from Bob.  Well, besides the meetings, we have to take lots of phone calls.  Lots of phone calls about meetings.  Every day we're pissing off maybe XM or we're pissing off this sponsor or we're pissing off  someone here in New York.  It's just a mess every day.  Yeah.  Something's going on that needs what I call fire control.  There are people that their job is to put out fires, not to get on the phone and yell  at us for making the fires.  Right.  Our job is to make fires. 
[00:11:30]  And then there are firemen.  And we'll always make fires.  Right.  That's our job.  We're making fires.  And then you'll get a phone call from us where we'll make believe that we didn't mean to  do that.  Oh, wow.  I didn't realize this was going to cause a problem.  I'm sorry.  Oh, geez.  Oh, boy.  Who knew this would cause any kind of a problem?  So yesterday, after the Steve walking meeting and the production, we do, I drive home and 
[00:12:00]  right when I get in the door, I got a handful of mail and packages that were left at my front  door and the phone's ringing.  So I look at who it is and I see it's Bob.  So I kind of drop everything and see what's up because it's always some kind of huge bad  news.  Yeah.  So I pick up the phone.  I'm talking to Bob.  And he was like, how was the vacation?  We talked about a couple of other things, but very light.  Didn't he joke to like, look, this isn't doom and gloom? 
[00:12:30]  Right before we hung up.  He's like, all right, well, take it easy.  I'm coming into town at some point.  So, you know, we'll get together.  He's like, see, no doom and gloom.  I was like, well, thank you, Bob.  Take it easy.  I'll talk to you soon.  Click.  Hang up.  I sit down to start working on my computer and the phone rings again and I see it's Bob.  He couldn't help himself, huh? 
[00:13:00]  He couldn't help himself.  Hi, Anthony.  I know I just called.  It was.  Oh, Jesus.  I just called and said no doom and gloom, but oh my God, did you, did you talk to Eric  Logan over to accept?  Yeah, Bob.  We talked to him on the air.  Oh, gee.  Oh, gee.  I'm so sorry.  There's a problem with Fox News and the stinger you're using. 
[00:13:30]  The stinger.  The stinger.  Yeah, Bob.  I know.  We talked it out on the air with Eric today on the air.  Yeah.  We talked about.  Yes, but I have a message on my air machine.  Oh, my God.  It's tragic.  Oh, it's such an angry message.  I think there's big trouble here.  This could be big trouble.  There could be monetary damages in there.  There's a trouble going.  Didn't you get our email a week ago about this?  Bob, I didn't get an email. 
[00:14:00]  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Oh, no.  I got the email.  I sent an email.  Did you not get one?  Opie got the email a week ago.  Why didn't anybody know about this?  And you know, he's thinking, oh, my God, my hot wife's going to leave me.  Unlike Bob.  If my commission from the Opie and Anthony show doesn't continue coming in.  Oh, God.  Yeah.  So here's what I said.  I go, well, Bob, we talked to Eric Logan and we pounded their little news stinger, their 
[00:14:30]  Fox News stinger.  And people that I don't know, Fox is threatening to sue us because we use their stupid stinger  from time to time.  We use their stinger.  You know, the Fox News alert stinger.  We use it.  And apparently they're mad at Fox for us using it.  They got in touch with Logan.  Logan apparently got in touch with us sometime last week.  I was in nose deep in coconut drinks and casino chips last week.  If I recall, I was not available for comment. 
[00:15:00]  So I didn't get any emails.  And so yesterday we just played the crap out of the sound clips.  When we heard they wanted to sue us, we played the crap out of the sound clips because personally,  and this was my argument, I would love if Fox News actually sued us for playing their stupid  sound clip because it would make news for the show.  And when push came to shove, nothing would come of it. 
[00:15:30]  Nothing would come of it.  They would keep yelling.  Then when it made the news that Opie and Anthony are playing their stupid sound and they're  suing us, it would be a great story.  People would talk about it.  And then the lawyers could talk and realize, okay, we won't play it anymore.  And it would go away.  The problem would be solved.  Did you just tear down a wall?  I just tore down a wall.  My God, man.  Which one?  I think it was the ninth wall.  You got it right.  Yes.  You'd tear down the eighth later. 
[00:16:00]  But that's pretty much what the deal was.  Yeah.  What I thought the deal should have been.  Well, no.  Not with Bob.  Oh, yes.  You don't understand.  It could be my monetary damage.  I can't even say it.  And if you're claiming that you never got my email last week, they might come after me.  They could come after me.  If I accept your statement that you would not play it anymore, that would implicate me and 
[00:16:30]  I could then be brought into court and testify that you were actually using me.  And let's be honest.  I don't even like picking up the lunch tab for everybody.  If I accept this letter, Kate, it might let the people know that I know where Michael is.  I don't know where Michael is.  Doom and gloom, Bob. 
[00:17:00]  And then Logan called me yesterday and I was like, oh, oh, oh, oh, that.  Oh, that was a problem yesterday when we kept playing the stinger.  Oh, I, oh, I didn't.  Oh, over and over again.  And then I, and then I just passed the buck, which is perfect for you and I.  I'm like, oh, you better talk to Anne.  That's all Anne on that one.  Yeah.  And I'm sitting there like, oh, I didn't know.  I, uh, I went through Bob and then, uh, Bob, I guess, called up, uh, Erica, Logan again.  And then he called me again. 
[00:17:30]  And it's like, all right, I talked to Eric.  Well, you know, he's, he's pretty upset about this, a little mad about it, but I, I, I talked  to him, I think everything's going to be okay.  I sent a prayer card, but you got to, oh, Anthony, you got to promise me something.  Promise me you won't play that sound clip again.  You know, your, your, your, your Bob. 
[00:18:00]  I'm so sorry.  Your Bob thing is very accurate, but let's be honest with each other here.  I mean, he's been our, uh, agent for 10 years.  We've, we've kind of put him through hell and back many times.  Of course we have.  And he's out there in LA.  So you got to think he wakes up every morning and just like Googles our names, hoping.  Yeah.  Probably throws Opie and Anthony in Google and then like, then hits like, uh, you know,  enter or send whatever.  And then, oh God, what's going to come up?  Closes his eyes. 
[00:18:30]  Then it opens them and goes, oh, okay.  All right.  Gets off the office to just tell him, please, somebody just read this and tell me if I'm  anything, any news alerts on Opie and Anthony.  Okay.  All right.  Good.  Oh, doom and gloom.  Bob, he should dress like an undertaker and just walk around.  Oh, I can't believe it.  So I had it.  That's that.  That was my, my early evening was dealing with that because Fox news is mad over a dumb 
[00:19:00]  stinger over a stupid sound.  And I'd love to see how things like that play out.  So people don't want to see how that plays out.  It'd be great.  Sometime this morning, we'll play the stinger.  Yes, girl.  And guess what?  We're going to turn off the lights.  This is what we do today.  All right.  We're going to turn off the lights, make it pitch dark in here.  Yeah.  The machine is over there.  And one of us is going to push the button.  It's going to hit it.  And then all hell is going to break loose later on today. 
[00:19:30]  Yeah.  What are they going to fire the whole show?  They got to fire the person that pushed the button.  But if it's dark and we don't know who pushed the button, then guess what?  We get away with another one.  Then we get away with another one.  That's what we do today.  When do you want to turn off the lights?  7.20 a lot of people.  7.20.  At 7.20 we'll be shutting the lights, people.  7.20 is the big get on a morning show.  So 7.20 will be the big bit where we turn off the lights and someone hits the Fox stinger.  Don't we have like an announcement that we teased yesterday or something? 
[00:20:00]  Two?  Jesus.  We're in lockdown.  We were in lockdown yesterday.  Oh, the lockdown thing.  Yeah, well.  We screwed that all up.  We ran out of time.  We all pointed to Eric and said that he pushed the button and then Fox sued Eric personally  for $4 million.  Oh, he'd have to give up his money.  He won in lotto.  I bet that's all gone, right?  Is that gone already?  It's invested.  It's invested.  Wait a minute.  What did you invest in?  Some property.  Property?  Property?  You didn't win that much money? 
[00:20:30]  Are you a landowner?  You bought a McDonald's.  How much did you win?  $100,000.  All right.  A lot of that.  After taxes.  $30,000 for taxes more or less, right?  Yeah, about.  So just a little bit over $70,000 I got to keep.  After your food bill.  No.  See, it's a food joke.  It never ends.  You bought land in Florida?  Yeah.  From Eric Estrada?  Did you buy some of that land?  He bought it from Ricky Roma.  He said you were on the board when this was drafted, right? 
[00:21:00]  Hold on.  We got a sweeper.  Oh.  We got a sweeper.  Right.  We got a sweeper.  Mm-hmm.  It's the Opie and Anthony E-Rock Clock Watch.  Is E-Rock late again?  Maybe his battery died.  I hear traffic was awful.  What time did E-Rock get in today? 
[00:21:30]  I like the snoring.  What time did E-Rock get in today?  He got in at 5, 12, and 36 seconds.  All right.  Only 12 minutes late.  12 and a half minutes late today.  There you go.  That's like implying also that he's supposed to get here at 5,  when we come in instead of beforehand to have some things set up for when we get in.  I believe most of the guys get here way before 5.  Yeah.  What time you get here, Than?  4.30.  4.30.  Yeah.  So E-Rock is technically like 45 minutes. 
[00:22:00]  It's like 5 minutes.  I don't know when this 5 o'clock thing started.  Do you know no one told anyone hours to come in?  It just, like, Than, I think, decided that 4.30 is a good time to have things ready for 5 when we come in.  And then for the next hour, we can all go over some stuff.  But did anyone ever tell E-Rock what time to come in?  E-Rock, why can't you come in at 5?  That's all we ask.  That's all we ask.  5 is even, you know.  Everyone else gets in around 4.30. 
[00:22:30]  You can't even get in 5 o'clock.  What's the problem, E-Rock?  No problem.  Oh.  No problem.  He's off.  He's off.  But no, you're late.  There's a problem.  There's a problem.  He just said he's trying to pull some Jedi Minecraft on us.  No problem.  It's one of the reasons.  He raved his hand.  No problem.  It's one of the reasons why the rest of the guys don't like you.  They're a little pissed off that you get to sleep in every day.  Yeah.  Well, if they stayed as long as I did, then.  Oh. 
[00:23:00]  Okay.  So he's taking it out on the back end of the show.  I got you.  All right.  All right.  Well.  Comment?  I've long had issues with Eric's time use.  Just because you're here till a certain time does not necessarily mean you're working.  Oh.  Back to you, E-Rock.  Oh, no.  We got the US Open happening right in the studio.  Yes. 
[00:23:30]  Yeah.  11.30 means, oh, just go over to XM and then take off and go home.  Oh.  Oh.  So you guys leave at 11.30?  No.  It depends.  I, for instance, yesterday I was here till 12.30, 12.45, interviewing new interns.  Ah.  All right.  E-Rock, what were you doing at 12 o'clock?  12 o'clock, I was picking stuff over at XM, came back over here, loaded in more worst of 
[00:24:00]  and some other filler material into the system.  Uh-huh.  Mm-hmm.  Okay.  Sounds reasonable.  Yeah.  Great.  Making stuff sound like work.  All right.  All right.  We got to take a break.  Oh, jeez.  I love this stuff.  Yeah.  Well, we'll get it.  And Sam came in smiling with the camera, of course.  He's your wrestling pal, though.  What happened?  I was just doing my job.  You're just doing your job.  You guys bonded at SummerSlam.  Yeah, really bonded.  What was I going to say?  Oh, man. 
[00:24:30]  I had a thought, but E-Rock.  Ah, whatever.  It'll come up.  All right.  We got to take our first break.  Phone number 877-212-ONA.  Sometime today, we'll finish up the big announcements from vacation.  Right.  We asked everyone on staff to write down something big that happened to them during their vacation.  Mm-hmm.  And still to go, we got three.  I told my girlfriend to get all of her crap out of my apartment.  Who said that?  Somebody in here said that. 
[00:25:00]  Someone wrote down, I got engaged.  Somebody got engaged.  A lot of speculation about this one on the message boards.  Yeah.  Very interesting.  And finally, I called my mother a...  I've been saying the word wrong.  A sociopath.  Thank you.  And she walked out of the restaurant.  So we're going to find out who wrote all these down sometime during the show today.  Guaranteed.  Mm-hmm.  These will be answered today.  Okay?  Interesting.  Okay.  It's Opie and Anthony. 
[00:25:30]  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  And we appreciate that.  What's up, Chicago?  You guys doing all right?  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Well, before we went to break...  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  The little E-Rock thing.  Uh-huh.  That was going on before we went to break?  Yeah.  Um, uh, it continues a little bit.  Some, some people chimed in and said, uh, does being on Pal Talk, uh, watching the Ron 
[00:26:00]  and Fez show mean he's working?  Oh.  Oh.  Uh, we have seen E-Rock on, uh, on Pal Talk.  Um, during the Ron and Fez show.  Nude?  Uh, no, not nude.  He's a, what they call a jacker in the room.  Gotta love the Pal Talk.  Wake up with Whoopi.  Who?  Yeah.  Wake up with Whoopi. 
[00:26:30]  Her radio show sucks.  No buzz whatsoever.  And now she's, uh, she's on The View as well.  Cause, you know, she doesn't have to work on a radio show, I guess.  No meetings for her over there, I guess.  Yeah, no kidding.  Wake up with Whoopi.  She's done and out of there.  She, what, debuted on The View yesterday and, uh, headlines all over the place because  she decided to defend Michael Vick.  You know what somebody raised to me, at some point raised, somebody raised to me because  I, I mentioned what had happened with us and how she hung up the phone and called back 
[00:27:00]  and talked off the air and now she's taken up for, it's like she got so much crap from  black people after that Ted Danson thing.  Yeah.  That, that's probably why she's.  Well, explain that whole thing, Jimmy, cause, uh, we went at it with her about the Imus thing.  She parodied many, many years ago.  Everyone knows what happened with Ted Danson where he went up in blackface.  It was a, it was to address the racism they were facing, like, by dating.  Right.  Sarcastic.  And she was with him, he was eating watermelon, but it was about, you know, let's just defuse  this racism.  So she got so much crap. 
[00:27:30]  So she started saying, I'm a should be fired when, when he did, uh, he said.  So, uh, we had her on the show and we had a nice interview with her.  Like, how could you come out against that?  Me as a comedian, it bothered.  And, uh, and I said, what about Ted Danson?  I mean, and then she goes to her producer, hang up, hang up, hang up, hang up.  And she had her producer disconnect the two shows.  We were both live on the air.  Yeah.  And we're like, I wasn't attacking her.  I was really asking.  I wasn't saying you suck.  Or it was, it was, it was, it was totally legitimate.  And we had had a problem with her. 
[00:28:00]  We had just attacked her for no reason.  Cause that's what the show does.  Well, no reason.  I mean, just to be, I've been saying she didn't, as far as a radio host, she's a hack.  And we, we, we point out that she's an awful, awful radio show.  I'm saying she wasn't attacking us.  We were just kind of having fun with it.  And then she showed up at XM and we all loved the fact that she just walked in.  We gave her respect for that.  And she was a great guest on our show.  And that's what she should do on radio is be a guest on the radio shows.  So we had fun with her.  Right.  And then, so we interviewed her kind of on friendly terms when she called us, she hung  up and then she called back off the air. 
[00:28:30]  And wanted to talk to us.  Yeah.  And said, yeah, I just didn't want to get into that.  I didn't want to, that was many years ago.  But it's like, it's very pertinent now.  If you're saying a guy should be fired like Trent Lott.  Yeah.  And you did it.  So whatever.  So now she's on the view defending Michael Vick.  And I guess she feels like she has to like step into Rosie O'Donnell's shoes and get controversial  because that's what she did.  A little controversy.  She got controversial yesterday.  She made some kind of Asian dog joke yesterday.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That you're not allowed to do on radio anymore because, you know, the special interest groups 
[00:29:00]  will go after you.  Her big defense for him was the fact that he's raised in that culture.  That was her big defense was there is a culture in the South that dog fighting and killing dogs  and doing what Michael Vick did is totally acceptable.  So he can't really be blamed for it.  But it's not acceptable.  Which to me is ridiculous.  It's completely against the law.  Because there's cultures in this society that also embrace gangs, drug culture. 
[00:29:30]  The Klan.  They're raising their culture.  The Klan is a culture of, yeah, of hatred that's from the South.  So is she defending all of those things because she's defending Michael Vick just based on the  fact that, hey, you people, and she was pretty much saying, without really saying it, you people just 
[00:30:00]  don't understand.  See, you're white and you're not raised in that atmosphere and you don't know these people.  So you don't understand.  But there is a culture that does this and you should just pretty much accept it.  Uh, huh?  What?  If Michael Vick said he was dog fighting as a teenager or before he got into it, it's  like people say, all right, you were raised that way.  You did some stupid stuff.  But after a while, you have to go, you know what?  I can't do this anymore.  Right.  And you stop doing it.  There's drug cultures.  Yeah.  So I guess you should never stop getting high. 
[00:30:30]  You should never stop selling dope.  Common sense steps in at some point.  No matter what this culture you're raised in is, you do have something called a free  will and your own mind, common sense, whatever it is that you all of a sudden realize, hey,  perhaps this isn't right.  This could be wrong, what I'm doing here.  And then, you know, you move forward with that.  But she was using it like, here's a grown man and she's defending him like some kind of 
[00:31:00]  child who didn't know better because he was just raised like that.  Right.  Well, that's a defense for everything.  That's a defense for Don Imus because, you know, Don is no kid.  I'm sure he was raised in a culture that threw around a lot worse language than that.  Same thing.  Jerry Lewis, we'll get into that, too, was chastised for his use of.  And before we move on with the Imus thing, and he was raised in a culture where that was  accepted on radio for many, many years. 
[00:31:30]  Right.  To get a bit outrageous and say some crazy crap.  Yeah.  That was his culture.  That was his culture.  He's known for it.  He was known for it, but he finally got caught and he had to pay the consequence, which we  still completely disagree with.  Yeah.  Well, what's the difference?  Michael Vick was in this culture, but he finally got caught because it's illegal.  And also gambling, look, the bottom line is, if you're involved in some kind of a gambling  thing in the NFL, you can't do it.  No.  It's like, is that referee's defense that he was raised in a culture of gambling? 
[00:32:00]  I don't know where he's from, but say he's from Brooklyn.  Well, he grew up with guys in the corner.  They all gamble.  Is that an excuse for him for fixing games and gambling?  No.  To whoopee it is.  It would have to be, or else she'd be a hypocrite.  And by the way, Michael Vick is from, I believe, Virginia.  Yeah.  That's not the deep South.  It's the start of the South.  It's the start.  It's the start of the South.  We have the whoopee hangup that Jimmy was just referring to a few minutes ago.  Here it is.  Why should radio show hosts that do a comedy show be held to higher standards?  Okay.  As like network news. 
[00:32:30]  Are you crazy?  We should be able to say whatever the hell we want when we do our program.  Excuse me.  God bless you.  Now, I'm willing to listen to you, but you know what?  If you're going to talk over me, I don't know who shall know.  Norton is, so I can't comment on what she does.  No, Cheryl Underwood.  Not Cheryl Norton.  Cheryl Underwood.  No, Underwood.  You're Norton.  Yes.  Oh, sorry.  Please.  Hey, what about Ted Danson?  I don't want to comment on her because I don't know what she does.  I'm having a conversation with someone.  Whoopee, what about the Ted Danson incident?  I mean, you guys caught, you were making a racial point.  No, no, no.  But I'm saying. 
[00:33:00]  Oh, hang up.  Hang up.  Hang up.  Hang up.  Hang up.  Hang up.  Hang up.  Hang up.  Hang up.  Hang up.  Because you said the Ted Danson thing.  Why would she hang up on that?  The fact is, the way I even asked that, there was no, I wasn't, I even said you were making  a racial point.  Yeah.  I knew what they were doing with Ted Danson.  Right.  I wasn't a racist.  They were together.  Yeah, you weren't attacking her.  No.  You were kind of using it as an example of what she was doing.  Well, here's some quick clips from yesterday. 
[00:33:30]  Goldberg defending Michael Vick.  But, you know, the Michael Vick thing, since we're talking about dogs, you know, there are  all of these very, very strong opinions about it.  And one of the things I haven't heard anybody say is, you know, from his background, this  is not an unusual thing for where he comes from.  It's like cockfighting.  It's the most part of the country he comes from.  Yeah.  It's like cockfighting in Puerto Rico.  You know, there are certain things that are indicative to certain parts of our country.  What part of the country is this?  He's from the deep south. 
[00:34:00]  And dogfighting is a lot.  And there's a lot of torturing and dogmurdering, though.  Well, that's part, unfortunately, it's part of the thing.  It's part of the thing.  It's part of the thing.  Until you get caught.  God forbid a white person came out and said something like that.  Holy Jesus.  You would be crucified.  Why can't black people just say he's screwed up and he's got it?  I don't understand why.  Because we are so separatist in this country between black and white. 
[00:34:30]  It's just the way it is.  Black people will go to great lengths to defend other black people.  Meanwhile, killing each other in record numbers.  But for some reason, you know, they will just defend whatever anybody does to the end, no matter what facts come out or anything like that.  And white people will continue to insist that there's reverse racism.  People are getting away with things.  It's just we're pretty much doomed if we ever think we're going to live together in a nation of peace and prosperity and everyone's going to get along. 
[00:35:00]  And we truly, and this is just the truth, we really don't understand each other very well.  We don't.  White people and black people don't have a great understanding of each other, regardless of why.  I know there are plenty of reasons why.  Slavery, oppression, bigotry.  There's plenty of reasons. 
[00:35:30]  But we just don't.  And I don't see it happening tomorrow.  It's just an ugly situation.  Scott M. from Hawpog.  You heard it here first, folks.  Whoopi is defending the KKK.  Yeah.  There's a culture.  It's a culture from the South that was raised.  They do what they do.  Well, what about the lynchings and the murderings?  Well, that's part of it.  That's part of their culture.  That's part of it.  You just don't understand.  You don't just spread the word of white power and white supremacists. 
[00:36:00]  You have to kill people.  And like the killing of the dogs, murdering of the dogs.  See, that's just part of it.  That's just part of the culture.  It's pretty much exactly what point she's making.  Is she stupid?  She continues.  You're a dog lover.  It's a part of their culture for a long time.  For a lot of people, dogs are sport.  It's not.  And so I just thought it was interesting because it seemed like a light went off in his head  when he realized that this was something that the entire country really didn't appreciate,  didn't like.  So do you think he should not have been sentenced as he was because you say that it goes with 
[00:36:30]  the territory?  Well, I don't know if it goes with the territory, but I thought it was, if it had been somebody  from New York City, my feelings would be very different.  What?  I don't get, what was he?  What did she say?  Where, where, where, where was he?  South America?  It's the United States.  He saw old Yeller just like I saw old Yeller.  Right.  Come on already. 
[00:37:00]  It's not Thailand.  You know, I think he's, someone may have brought it to his attention once before.  Ralph Waldo Ederson, I think, said behind every action, the answer to every action is a thought.  That's true.  But, but, you know what?  Sometimes.  I hate her, too.  No, I don't think he did.  I don't think he did.  Because this, and the world that he comes from, it's not important.  We have a different relationship to dogs and cats and things.  It's like the Chinese.  They have a different relationship to cats.  Listen, in some countries, they do. 
[00:37:30]  And you and I would be really pissed if somebody ate Kitty.  Are you saying?  I mean, look, to point out that there's a double standard with animals and stuff is valid.  There is a double standard.  You can kill this.  Not even, you know, you can't, whatever.  But it's like, when you're electrocuting and hanging dogs, stop it.  It's different.  Browning them?  Yeah, stop.  Stop defending that as a part of it.  Stop it.  All right, let's go to Atlanta.  It's Clyde, everyone. 
[00:38:00]  Clyde, what's up?  Hey, man, how you doing?  All right.  I'm from Atlanta.  I've never been to a dog fight.  Michael Vick didn't grow up on Little Granny's farm down here.  They don't fight dogs down here.  I've never seen a dog fight.  I've been here 34 years.  Well, she should just say, I forgive him.  He's black.  Yeah.  She was pretty much teetering on that, wasn't she?  He acted like he grew up on Sambo's farm down here, and that stuff's not going on.  Well, I'm sure, look, I'm sure that it's, there aren't hillbillies at dog fight, I mean, 
[00:38:30]  but, sorry, Clyde, I'm distracted.  I mean, good point.  I got to move on immediately, because Stephen S. from Bayshore, he writes, somebody would  be really sick if they ate her kitty.  Ah, that's safe.  Ah, line of the day.  It's over.  The competition's over right there.  All right. 
[00:39:00]  There you go.  Whoopi's first day on the view.  That's good.  Well, she got a little controversy.  That's always good for the show.  Yeah.  Uh, you think they discussed that beforehand?  I wonder.  Barbara Walters doesn't seem to like it.  You know what?  She is, Barbara Walters is an uptight, cryptic, dead body of a bitch, and she doesn't seem  to like that controversy.  She shied away from it with Rosie O'Donnell, because she loses control of the show, because  she's not controversial.  She's not. 
[00:39:30]  She's just an old hen who wants to sit there with a bad speech impediment, with a stroke  mouth, and pontificate.  She's not controversial.  But the thing is, she's also got to understand, though, that between the time Rosie O'Donnell  was off the show and yesterday, no one can remember one goddamn thing that happened  on that show.  Right.  So, I don't know if maybe...  She doesn't...  I don't think she understands that this is what's getting the ratings.  Right.  The controversy.  Yeah.  She enjoys the ratings, but she doesn't enjoy the controversy.  The controversy. 
[00:40:00]  Well, that sounds familiar.  Right.  That sounds real familiar.  Right, exactly.  Hey, get some ratings, but hey, watch that controversy.  Don't play the fox sweeper.  Don't play the fox sweeper.  Jesus.  They might actually sue.  Hey, you know what?  In parts of the Middle East and other parts of the world, beating women in the street is  part of the culture.  Part of the culture for thousands of years.  Literal circumcisions are part of the culture in certain parts of the world.  Right, exactly.  But we recognize that as barbaric.  Nobody excuses it and goes, well, you know, they were raised... 
[00:40:30]  Eh, they were raised that way.  Let's just, you know, agree to disagree.  It's not what happens.  Stop with that fucking...  Yeah, her argument did not wash.  When I heard it yesterday, I'm just like, come on, Whoopi.  Well, there you go.  Congratulations to her.  She got a little bit talking about her on the view.  Wake up with Whoopi.  Wake up with Whoopi.  Burp.  Yeah.  It's Opie and Anthony.  It's Opie and Anthony.  My brother's starting something. 
[00:41:00]  I don't know.  I don't know what this is about.  Elmo.  Brother Elmo on MySpace.  Sells the t-shirts for the show.  Keep everybody's head above water.  That's right.  That's what we do.  Well, my other brother, Brett, is getting married Sunday.  You know, the owner of FH Riley's.  Yes.  In Huntington Village.  It is a great restaurant.  Go check it out. 
[00:41:30]  Tom's like, what's up with all the FH Riley plugs today?  I can't help it.  My brother's getting married.  So it comes up in conversation.  Anyway, there's going to be a bachelor party on Friday.  And my brother is suggesting that it's like it's an open invite.  Is he nuts?  That is crazy.  I don't know what this is about yet.  So I got to get to the bottom of it.  And he's also saying that we need entertainment.  So to put the word out that we need entertainment for my brother's bachelor party Friday.  Who's the best man?  Is one of your brothers the best man? 
[00:42:00]  All of us.  Okay.  That's a last minute.  Well, actually, it's Gavin who dropped the ball.  We all have been in this situation, you know.  You are.  You got someone getting married.  And then it's someone's responsibility as the best man to get the bachelor party together.  And then last minute, nothing has happened.  Yep.  So now we're all scrambling.  So all the brothers are getting involved in getting the bachelor party together for Brett.  Because Gavin dropped the ball.  That is dropping the ball.  What was Gavin doing?  What was he investigating? 
[00:42:30]  You couldn't get a bunch of chicks or make some balls.  I don't know.  He was talking about, yeah, we'll go fishing in Orient Point.  We'll play a round of golf.  We'll go to a strip club.  All these ideas have been floating around for months at F.H. Riley's if you hang there.  And now, like, we're, what, three, four days away from the wedding and there's no bachelor party planned.  So now my brother Elmo's suggesting that there's going to be an open invite bachelor party.  Possibly at the restaurant.  Oh.  And I don't know if Greg wants this to happen there. 
[00:43:00]  You can't drop the ball when you're the best man like that.  And then Elmo writes, plus if anyone can provide entertainment, in parentheses.  Yeah, we all know what that is.  I mean, in quotes, have them contact me at MySpace.  Hubba hubba.  Brother Elmo in MySpace.  Strip club.  I remember going to my buddy Cowbell Bill's wedding.  Yeah.  And the bachelor party was at a strip club that was the restaurant that I got married in. 
[00:43:30]  Yuck.  So it's the same place I got married, but then it was a strip club.  Wait, isn't that the same place you had your taxes done back in the day, too?  Yes, in the basement.  Isn't it?  One-stop shopping.  Dude.  And I used to get a, and I love that guy, by the way, but, you know, our careers kind of blew up and we kind of got a little nervous that our tax guy was, his office was in the front of a strip club.  Yeah, it was kind of around back and underneath. 
[00:44:00]  And it was all legit and all, but there was something that was a little scary about that.  Yeah, we had to move on, unfortunately.  Yeah.  I love that guy.  Here's a word of advice.  I'm not a tax expert, but if you're having taxes done and you can hear Rhythm is the Dancer playing through the wall, leave that person.  It might be time to move on.  It was hilarious because, you know, the first time, Ant goes, oh, I got a guy.  I got a guy to do your taxes, man.  He's been part of our family.  Family.  Well.  In quotes. 
[00:44:30]  He's been doing people's taxes.  I got a guy, man.  You got to see him.  So I'm driving, you know, with the address you gave me and I'm looking, I'm looking, I'm looking.  I'm like, wow, this is a strip club.  This is a strip club, man.  What the F is this?  And then I go around back and, and there it is, his, his, his, his side.  Okay.  His side.  Okay.  So, um, so now your expenses, did you, uh, drive your car to and from work more than 20 miles a day? 
[00:45:00]  Yes.  All right.  Very good.  Uh, did that, I'm looking here at your American Express bill.  What?  You're going to have to itemize, you're going to have to itemize some of these deductions.  What?  So I know which ones are legitimate business deductions.  It's cash.  And, hey.  Ladies and gentlemen, coming to the stage right now is Tamron.  Tamron is coming to the stage. 
[00:45:30]  You might remember who's Dallas Cowboy Jillian.  Let's give it up for her right now.  What about the receipts?  Here's my box of receipts.  A box of what?  Receipts.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  You told me to bring the receipts.  Yes.  I'll go through these and make sure everything is legit.  What?  I can't hear you.  Yeah.  What?  Ladies and gentlemen, isn't she beautiful?  Make sure you give her a big tip.  She's going to be back on the stage a little later on.  But let's now, right now, bring up the beautiful. 
[00:46:00]  Ah, what the hell is this horse name?  You said something about clothes.  My clothes.  My receipt for clothes I've bought over the years.  Your clothing can be deductible.  You want to go upstairs for a beer?  I can't wait to write the book, man.  It's going to be a good read.  Yeah, that was a...  I didn't have a guy, so I'm like, all right, I'm going to go to this guy and get my taxes 
[00:46:30]  done.  Eh, why not?  And he was legit and all that, but we...  And I feel bad to this day that we had to move on, but something about it just made me  a little nervous.  I'd rather have the safety of doom and gloom Bob when it comes to my taxes.  He was built to just deal with numbers.  Of course.  Bob?  Oh, yeah.  Of course.  That's what he does.  That's it.  Of course.  Doom and gloom Bob knows people that know how to do the things completely legit.  Yeah.  That's it.  Somebody wants to plug Pal Talk. 
[00:47:00]  Well, we plug Pal Talk every day, but they want to get the word out to remind the ladies  it's Whip Him Out Wednesday on Pal Talk.  Oh.  All right.  Who's begging?  Ken from East Providence, Rhode Island.  Oh, okay.  Well, we know that WoW is alive and well on Pal Talk.  All right.  Yes.  We've got to get to a couple other things here.  Poor Jerry Lewis had to apologize.  How much did he raise?  How much did this...  Here's a guy.  No one remembers because he had to apologize.  Because he had to apologize.  Because in this day and age, you know, apologizing for a slip of the tongue is much more important 
[00:47:30]  than raising $63 million.  I'm sorry.  I was up there.  I'm out of my mind.  I'm 80 some odd years old.  I come from a culture where this is accepted.  Yeah.  I come from a culture.  He absolutely...  Boy, if that's not a defense, he definitely comes from that culture hanging out with all  them guys.  Right.  Back then, that word is nothing.  To him.  He used it all the time in his comedy act back on the road when he was in Vaudeville. 
[00:48:00]  I mean, how many gay people were upset by what Jerry Lewis said?  They throw that word around with each other.  Glad was.  Glad was.  Glad came out?  Yeah.  Glad came out and said...  Well, they already came out, but I mean, they had a press conference here.  Yeah.  And so they were very angry at his derogatory remark, which the news can't even play.  It's hysterical.  They say, and Jerry Lewis in trouble for a remark he made that angered some people.  And then they play it and beep out the entire word. 
[00:48:30]  So it sounds even worse.  So now everyone can have fun.  Sounds like he was pulling a Michael Richards.  Now everyone can have fun.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Everyone could get mad.  Can Glad rename themselves?  I mean, you don't name yourselves after a garbage bag.  It just sounds silly.  All I think of when I hear them is this Tom Bosley is a homosexual and he's upset about  something.  Yeah, you're right, Jimmy.  I laugh at that.  It's just a bad choice.  What is it, an acronym when you take the first letter of everything? 
[00:49:00]  Yeah.  Well.  Gay and lesbian.  Anti-defamation.  Anti-defamation.  Jerry Lewis, who basically...  What's the D?  What is the D?  Where does the D go?  Gay, lesbian, anti-defamation.  Maybe it's anti-defamation.  A and D.  Alliance against defamation.  All right, whatever.  Oh, I didn't know.  How can the...  Oh, Alliance against...  There's two A's.  And one D.  Just the way I like it.  Yeah. 
[00:49:30]  Yeah, brother.  Only a gay guy would know what that means, by the way.  Of course.  Whoever was yelling in the background.  Fan spit out Alliance immediately.  Boy, he had no problem with that.  Yeah, Fan.  Oh, he's...  Oh, Google.  Google, all right, sure.  Who's Google?  I don't know.  What's that stand for?  For true.  Shouldn't it be...  You said it should be two D's and one A, right?  Well, I thought it was two D's.  Yeah.  I'm surprised it's not gold. 
[00:50:00]  It's just a bunch of D's.  A G and L.  A bunch of D's and a smiley face.  Who doesn't want to play World War II fighter pilot?  Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do.  Just called D.  Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do.  Anyway, in case you missed it, Jerry Lewis, who's given his soul to try to, like, cure a disease that isn't going to be cured anytime soon, obviously.  Billions.  Raised another 63 million. 
[00:50:30]  He's going to die on TV trying to, like, cure MDA.  So he slipped and said this.  We're into hour 18.  Look how good he moves that camera over here.  Son of a gun.  Wherever I go, he goes, let's see what you do with this over here.  Oh, your family has come to see you.  You remember Bart, your oldest son?  Jesse, the illiterate faggot.  No. 
[00:51:00]  And then he goes, no.  But he clawed himself.  Was he yelling at himself there?  He had an out-of-body experience.  Holy jeez, he died for a second.  He went, no, no.  I didn't say that.  Oh, my God.  I will say that that's kind of a rough one to sell on TV.  I understand we all improv a little, but illiterate faggot's a tough one to sell and go.  You got to kind of go.  I guess you got to say sorry after that one.  Yeah, yeah.  Maybe he's just trying to get himself fired from doing this. 
[00:51:30]  He doesn't want to do it anymore.  Stupid telethon.  Next year, he's going to be saying nappy-headed.  He's going to be saying everything just to get fired from this thing.  He's just an old guy who just, that stuff's ingrained in him.  That is ingrained in him like dogfighting is in the South.  There you go.  Yeah, exactly.  We're just losing our minds in this society of ours.  Oh, there's...  We're all on tight.  Does a day go by when someone doesn't have to apologize to somebody? 
[00:52:00]  Oh, crap.  I said day-go.  I'm sorry.  I'm going to apologize to my brother.  Italians out there.  I didn't mean...  I meant...  Does a day go by?  Right.  Not the derogatory term for Italian American.  Oh, my God.  Yes, I used a gay reference there.  Oh, sorry. 
[00:52:30]  Sorry.  Does...  Does...  I dumped myself.  Hey, you can't say that.  I can't say that.  It's I can't say that Wednesday.  I just dumped myself.  Ha, ha.  All right.  Listen.  Here's the apology from Jerry Lewis.  Well, Jerry Lewis says there are no excuses for his recent use of a gay slur.  The 81-year-old apologized yesterday after using a derogatory word during his Labor Day telethon for muscular dystrophy. 
[00:53:00]  Oh, your family has come to see you.  You remember Bart, your oldest son?  Jesse, the illiterate...  No.  The telethon went on to raise nearly $64 million for the MDA, setting a new record.  A few weeks ago, Lewis came under fire for saying Merv Griffin deserved to die because he didn't treat the prostate cancer that eventually killed him. 
[00:53:30]  Are you sure that's the only reason, Jerry, that he deserved to die?  Yeah, really.  It seems there's a theme in your commentary.  It's a bit of a theme there, huh, Jerry?  Ha, ha, ha.  Your Jerry Lewis never liked me either.  Ha, ha, ha.  That's funny, man.  And then they bleep it, so now you're wondering what he said.  Yeah, it sounds worse.  You know what?  I put the word retard in there.  Ooh.  I decided to go with retard.  I said it almost sounds like the C word. 
[00:54:00]  Really?  Yeah, for some reason the C word jumped into my head.  We're doing like an audio Rorschach test is what that is.  I say C word.  You say retard.  I went with retard.  Jimmy?  Because the news wasn't brave enough to actually freaking replay what he said.  Yeah.  You're the news.  You're allowed to.  You don't want to know what I'm doing.  Let's just say good place for the beep.  Ha, ha, ha.  Because if you think Imus got fired, my choice would have gotten him executed.  Ha, ha, ha. 
[00:54:30]  Ha, ha, ha.  All right, well, in other news, Larry Craig update.  What do we got on Larry Craig?  Of course, he's the senator that was in the men's room in an airport, and he's claiming  he needs a wide stance when he's doing his business.  And he was picking up a paper off the floor.  That's why his hand was under the...  This guy doesn't know if he's a top or a bottom.  He's flip-flopping all over the place.  He's not gay.  He's in the bathroom stall.  Undercover topic. 
[00:55:00]  He pled guilty.  He says he shouldn't have pled guilty.  He resigned from his office.  Now he's saying, latest news, he might not step down from his office.  He doesn't know what the hell he's doing.  Now, I think people have been getting to, you know, they've been talking to him.  Giving him a little chat.  You know, whispering in his ear.  Right.  A little bit.  And he says, you know, I could get past this. 
[00:55:30]  Yeah.  Good luck.  Because there'll probably be skeletons.  Yeah, I think there's...  Flying out of that closet.  I think there's more that's going to come out.  Skeletons, of course something's going to come out.  Skeletons, and they're all going to be shaped the exact same way.  Just one nice big fat bone with a hat on it.  Yeah, not the whole skeleton.  Just one.  One bone.  One bone after another poking through a hole that's been drilled by someone even more addicted  to sex than I am.  Just the wide stance thing makes me laugh every time I hear it. 
[00:56:00]  And he needs to go into the wide stance position to take care of business.  It's like, Larry, we all go to the bathroom.  It's not like he's picking an activity that nobody knows.  Everyone knows about or does.  Everyone does it.  Oh.  Of course, you know the story with the undercover cop in the stall next door.  Tapping the foot.  He was tapping the foot.  Looking for some action.  And you know something?  Who the hell knew that one?  I got to be honest with you.  And, Jimmy, you know a lot of these hijinks that go on in these places just because you've 
[00:56:30]  been around.  You've been around some of these things.  I was raised in that culture.  You were raised in that culture.  My father brought me when I was a boy.  He said, son, two taps is yes.  Three taps is I'll be back in 20 minutes.  Now, that tapping the foot thing.  Did you hear about that or know about that beforehand?  No.  No.  What do you mean?  I don't hang out in rest areas.  I know, but you're educated about the pervert lifestyle.  I've been hit on in bathrooms, but no, like by subtly. 
[00:57:00]  Yeah.  But if someone was tapping their foot next to me in a stall, I wouldn't think twice about  I would think he's just tapping his foot to his iPod.  It would depend on what it was.  If it was late at night.  If it's a guy listening to music, but any time anyone I feel is trying to contact me  in a bathroom, it's never good.  Well, I've been hit on in a bathroom.  Of course you have.  Look at you.  I was on the way to Boston, and I'm looking at the perpetrator.  I was hitting on him every rest area we stopped at.  And I'm telling you. 
[00:57:30]  It's embarrassing.  It's in Jimmy's book.  He made me uncomfortable all the way to Boston on one of our fine trips to do radio up there.  When Opie walks into a restroom, he is the Grace Kelly of men's room hit on a bullseye.  This is pretty much the only mention I get in Jimmy's Happy Endings book is that I'm an 11 in the rest area.  Thanks, Jimmy.  He walks in actually at disco ball.  All the great times we've had together, this is the only thing you want to bring up in your book.  A disco ball drops over the urinals and spins gently and stay in a live place when he walks in. 
[00:58:00]  A light just shines on him automatically.  Jimmy has a way of making you very uncomfortable in bathrooms.  Extremely uncomfortable.  If anyone's trying to contact you in that situation, it can't be good.  It's creepy.  What do you got there, Kenny?  Back in the day, somebody might have been involved in one of these type of things in a park.  And the signal was jingling your keys.  Jingling the keys.  Yeah, as people are hanging out in the park and if you walk by and the signal was to jingle the keys. 
[00:58:30]  Ah.  Jingle jangle.  See, I knew that the, what are they called on the expressway where you park, the park and ride.  Right.  It's like park and rides.  That's what they are.  You park your car and you carpool in with somebody.  You park and you ride.  And you ride.  Exactly.  A park and suck.  So, I used to have to go into the park and ride to pick up my helper, my little helper when I was working in the sheet metal industry. 
[00:59:00]  And the code there was to just park in a certain area that was back by the woods.  It boarded the parking lot in the woods.  And they would leave their parking lights on.  And you'd sit there and wait.  Just da-dee-dee-da and wait for somebody to come to your window.  So, how long did it take?  Ah, the slowest had to be an hour wait, but the, they would, uh, yeah, that was the, the park and rides on Long Island.  Very big for picking up, uh, homosexuals. 
[00:59:30]  Why do they have to pick signals that everyone does?  Like, I could see, like, a psst or a hey you, but this.  I think they need a new signal.  That could be anyone.  The key jingling, Santa, coming through with his bells of jingling.  Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.  Look what's glowing.  We got, we got, we got Bruce in upstate New York.  Bruce, what's up?  Hey, guys.  I just found out, I thought the code for gay people was, it's getting cold out here.  Yeah, the famous Patrice O'Neal story.  All right.  I got an arrest here.  Oh, my God. 
[01:00:00]  Is that a great story?  It's getting cold.  We'll have to replay that.  Yeah, oh, I'm cold.  Yeah, Patrice was getting a little shut-eye at a rest area because he was falling asleep  on the way home from a gig, and a guy was knocking on the door, and Patrice wakes up,  and the guy's like, hey, it's getting cold out here.  It's cold out here.  Is that a...  So Patrice was like, well, why don't you go inside, stupid?  Yeah, go inside, stupid.  What's wrong with you?  And then he started thinking, was that guy, did he, was he trying to, what, no?  Yeah.  Patrice probably regretted it after he realized that he could have gotten one for free. 
[01:00:30]  Just close your eyes.  Who cares?  If his hair's past his collar, you can pretend it's Christy McNichol in 1979.  If you close your eyes, it's not gay.  Here's a Larry Craig update.  So, yeah, a spokesman says he's reconsidering his decision to resign.  A phone call from Senator Arlen Specter urging him to fight for his seat is what made him reconsider.  Fight for his seat.  That's a good one. 
[01:01:00]  Decision will depend on outcome of legal case and ethics investigation.  Can I say one thing?  I think this is about his kids, too.  I think his kids came out and said they believed him.  But I think they're like, Dad, why are you giving in to this?  Nobody wants to think your dad is tapping the foot of a young cop.  Right.  So they're probably like, Dad, you've been real.  He's probably like, oh, my God, I got to fight this now.  So it's Craig to change plea and fight charges.  My hunch is it'll end in a suicide.  He even looks like Bud Dwyer, doesn't he?  Our Bud Dwyer, man. 
[01:01:30]  Oh, God.  Well, if one shot to the mouth doesn't work, maybe this one will.  All right.  Look what he pulled out of a bag.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  We got Tim.  He's pretty much taking over production duties around here because he's able to turn production  around like this.  Oh, yeah.  Like this.  He came up with this yesterday.  Are you tired of singles bars?  Are you looking for a sure thing? 
[01:02:00]  Introducing Anthony Cumia's seminar for man-on-man bathroom sex.  Hey, hey, hey, hey.  You're cruising the urinals, and there's someone beside you that you think is hot.  You might just give him a glance and see if he can strike eye contact.  In his seminar, Anthony will instruct you how to find the best places to go.  A good way to find out whether a restroom is cruisy.  Look for graffiti on the stall walls.  He'll even give you insider tips on how to find that special partner. 
[01:02:30]  If there's someone beside you, try tapping your foot once.  It's man-on-man gay bathroom sex with Anthony Cumia.  Now, he moves his foot over and touches the other guy's foot.  When this touch is made and then no one moves away, I would like some gay bathroom sex.  What?  You're not a tapper?  Anthony Cumia has other methods of making yourself known.  Clearing your throat can also be a good way of letting others know. 
[01:03:00]  Anthony Cumia's seminar for man-on-man bathroom sex.  You've got to jiggle the bait around, or else the fish ain't going to bite.  Now, in a rest stop near you.  I can just see the fun that's going to happen in the bathroom here today.  That last line is hilarious, man.  I guess you've got to jiggle the bait.  We've got to take a break.  When we get back...  Dick Clark?  Huh?  What happened?  Dick Clark in the bathroom.  Uh-uh.  Uh-uh.  Uh-uh.  Clearing his throat.  Oh, no.  Dick Clark.  What are you doing? 
[01:03:30]  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Uh-uh.  Uh-uh.  Is he saying uh-uh or is he really into this?  I don't know.  It's clearing his throat.  That's the signal.  That is the signal.  But it does sound like he's saying uh-uh.  Uh-uh.  Oh, boy.  Clearing your throat.  Again, another thing...  That sounds like after the fact.  Uh-uh.  That's when he's done.  Uh-uh.  It's kind of like being lactose intolerant. 
[01:04:00]  Can't get enough of this freaking Larry Craig guy.  He rules.  All right, listen.  We got to get some...  Rotten old queen.  Wide stance.  Yeah.  Big wide stance.  It's like a sumo wrestler getting ready.  And I just feel sorry for the cop once again that he has to sit there all day.  What did he do wrong?  That this is his thing.  Yeah.  That this is his duty.  Right?  Yeah.  Exactly.  We're going to get some answers after the break, finally.  Ah.  During the break, something happened to everybody that is associated with... 
[01:04:30]  During our vacation, yeah.  During our, yeah, our vacation.  Are we going to lock down?  Yeah, we'll do this, finally.  So we got...  And everyone wrote down something that happened to them during vacation.  We answered a lot of these yesterday.  We got three to go.  Hopefully after the break.  Hopefully.  Oh, no.  But I do have a really funny commercial from the 80s for booby-choo.  What?  Booby-choo.  Booby-choo.  So we might have to do this and this after the break, okay?  Sorry, people are never getting to it.  It's a breast-enhancing gum. 
[01:05:00]  Booby-choo.  Yes.  I never heard of that.  It was in the 80s?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  So we're going to try to do this, and we're going to get the answers to these three things  that were written down yesterday.  Somebody on vacation called their mother a sociopath.  Yeah.  And she walked out of the restaurant.  Okay.  Somebody during the vacation got engaged.  Mm-hmm.  Who was that?  Mm-hmm.  And somebody told their girlfriend to get all of her crap out of their apartment. 
[01:05:30]  Wow.  We'll get the answers to all these things, these last three things after the break.  Sure, we will.  It's Whip Them Out Wednesday on Opie and Anthony.  Welcome back to the Opie and Anthony program.  And if you're just joining us, welcome for the first time.  Yeah.  Because sometimes it's not a welcome back.  Someone's here, and they go, why is he saying welcome back? 
[01:06:00]  I just got here.  I just punched you efforts in.  Make me laugh.  That's what I think they say.  Come on.  Well, what are we going to do?  Are we going to reveal a mystery?  Or are we going to go with the thing you had?  The booby-choo?  Booby-choo.  Booby-choo rules.  I do.  You have to my curiosity with booby-choo. 
[01:06:30]  It's from the 80s.  It's a commercial?  Yeah, yeah.  We'll do that after.  What are we going to call it booby-choo?  Let's do some answering.  All right.  We're going to answer some questions.  What's this thing all about?  Immediately.  We'll answer it immediately.  Well, we were on vacation last week.  We all went our separate ways and did our separate things and had a lot of fun.  And things happen when you're on vacation.  So we all wrote down, like, one little highlight and pulled them out of the proverbial hat and 
[01:07:00]  then tried to guess whose little secret was written on the paper.  And one of the highlights, I think, was Danny's.  Punching a light pose?  Yeah, Danny ended up in Texas on his vacation.  Austin, Texas.  And he struck out trying to pick up chicks.  Struck out trying to pick up every chick in the bar.  Every chick in the bar until closing time.  Went out and punched a light pole and his hand is still all swollen from it. 
[01:07:30]  It looks like a big blueberry muffin.  It's all puffy.  You've got big puffy hands because you're silly.  I think I ordered your hand at Starbucks today.  I think it's huge.  I wish I could have taken a picture of it when it actually happened because it was so, so  much worse.  Oh, I bet.  I think you broke a knuckle or something.  Yeah, probably.  I mean, it really does.  The middle one is still pretty swollen.  It really, really hurts.  We're so stupid as human beings to hit things that we know don't give.  Light poles, brick walls. 
[01:08:00]  But you hit them.  In college, I used to punch brick walls all the time.  You get mad.  All the time.  Bam, you hit a brick wall.  And then you wake up one day and realize, you know, that really hurts.  I'm not doing that anymore.  It doesn't move.  Well, so Travis, of course, Travis and his lovely new bride went to Disney and got a  bunch of pictures taken with a bunch of the characters.  And we've seen them all.  And they're hilarious.  Yeah.  My favorite is the one with them.  Travis and Lisa have their hands together. 
[01:08:30]  Yes.  And Tinkerbell.  Yeah.  You take the picture and then they tell you to come to a certain area and pick up the  picture.  So when they took the picture, they must have told them to put their hands out, but  put them together and look down into your hands.  And they did that.  When they pick the picture up, what is in there but a cartoon Tinkerbell?  They had Tinkerbell in there.  Tink.  That's adorable.  That's adorable.  I love it.  And they wore the little veil, the Mickey, the Minnie Mouse veil ears and the top hat 
[01:09:00]  Mickey ears as bride and groom.  Somebody should have, instead of Tinkerbell, put an IED in their hands and blown both of  their arms off.  Oh, God.  That would have been a Disney photo.  That's not romantic or fun.  It's the happiest place on earth, Jimmy.  Don't mess with the happiest place on earth, Jimmy.  Let's get some more answers.  So the next one is someone on vacation called their mother a sociopath and she walked out 
[01:09:30]  of the restaurant.  Now, a lot of people have been speculating on this one.  A lot of people have been speculating.  What are they saying?  What are people saying?  Saying it was me.  But everyone knows I didn't do that.  I would never say anything bad about my mommy.  It's creepy that you call your mother mommy.  I love my mommy.  Do you realize how old you are?  Yes.  You're supposed to start calling your mom mommy at, I don't know.  I'll give it to like 13. 
[01:10:00]  13?  Yeah, I'll give it 13.  That's the cutoff.  You're well into your whatever you are.  We don't even know anymore.  You're like a vampire.  I get her.  You shouldn't be calling your mother mommy anymore.  It's creepy.  When I get her cards for her birthday, I get her cards that are meant for a mother from  her five-year-old son and I write mommy backwards and I give it to my mommy and she laughs.  You sign it with a crayon.  You want to make your mommy laugh. 
[01:10:30]  No, I don't.  And my brother and sister, I go to the ebony section.  I've done that before.  I go to the ebony section.  I got my mother one time accidentally a stepmother card.  Oh, Jesus.  I didn't see it and she was going through menopause at the time.  She was just an enchantress.  Enchantress.  And I gave it to her and she's crying and I'm like, what?  Wow, this is great.  It was a complete action and I was a teenage idiot.  I just didn't see it.  Stepmother.  Stepmother.  All right, I know. 
[01:11:00]  Funny gag though.  I got the mother part.  The foreign.  Here you go, step.  The foreign language cards are the best.  Yeah, those are good too.  I call my mom birth giver.  That's what I call her.  All right, so who called their mom a sociopath?  Step up to the mic.  We don't have the rest of the crew in here.  Do we need anybody else?  Who is it?  Ah, because it's radio.  They don't know.  Out there in Radioland, you just think everyone's in the studio and someone's going to walk up  gathered around and then we act surprised when we see that it's Than. 
[01:11:30]  Oh.  He's the only one in the room, so of course it has to be Than.  Than.  What happened, Than?  Well, me and my lovely girlfriend were visiting my mom in Nantucket, which is a beautiful locale.  Oh, I heard a rhyme about that place once.  Forgot how it went.  I know.  Is it and can you?  And if it were, would you?  Yes, yes, and yes.  And we went out to dinner. 
[01:12:00]  And it's important to note that I was ordering like I wasn't going to have to pay.  Oh.  Because mother usually picks up the bill.  Mother.  Mother is sicker than mommy.  It is, by the way.  And he does call his mom mother.  Because mommy's funny.  You call your mom mommy.  Mommy's funny.  It makes her laugh when I call her mommy.  Mother is Norman Bates.  All of them.  Mother.  Blood.  Yeah, mother is Norman. 
[01:12:30]  Creepier.  She's a whore, Norman.  Norman.  Oh, mother.  What have you done?  Oh, what am I doing?  Ha-la-la-la-la.  That old Tony Perkins.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh.  By the way, corporate.  There's a virus sitting up at the window looking down at him.  Ha-ha-ha.  By the way, corporate, very happy today because we're using a lot of sounds.  Wow.  Look at us go.  They want sounds on this show.  There's your effing sounds. 
[01:13:00]  So, Than, you were in Nantucket, which is a very, that's a wealthy, is your mom, is mother  a bit well-to-do, say, if she's comfortable?  Yes.  Divorcing my dad is a lucrative business.  Oh!  Wow.  Wow.  I like this.  So, what did you order at dinner knowing that mother was going to pay?  Mother should be paying.  Uh, well, surf and turf is very good up there.  Yes, and, well, and also mother enjoys her wine. 
[01:13:30]  So, there was a couple bottles of that being purchased.  And then, um, also before dinner, for some reason, my girlfriend dared me to do a shot.  Why?  Just because she was feeling silly.  So, you do a shot, maybe you loosen up a little bit.  Yeah, and then a couple, you know, I guess a half a bottle of wine later for me.  Is it normally a tense situation with mother? 
[01:14:00]  Yes, it's very tense.  Okay.  Why?  What's the problem with mother?  Well, mother.  How long has it been tense?  Uh, 15 years, maybe.  Oh, wow.  Because you like daddy better?  Um, well.  Or should I say father?  To father.  But, to, but, not to find a point on it.  Um, I hold her chiefly responsible for the separation of my parents.  Nice.  One of those kids.  I love it.  It explains so much.  All right, so Dan thinks that, is your dad still alive? 
[01:14:30]  Yes.  Okay, so you guys, you probably look closer to your dad than your mom.  Yes, much.  Okay.  Is dad happy now?  Yes.  Okay.  And why, uh, this might be a silly question, why is there still any relationship with mother?  Just, she's got the Nantucket house.  Okay.  And I thought it was just to be like one of those, you don't want to be that family that  just has somebody that doesn't talk to somebody.  I don't know.  That seems like an odd little thing.  That's a goal I'm working towards.  Oh, are you?  Okay. 
[01:15:00]  Yeah.  Why do you blame her more than your father?  Um, because there was a lot of, uh, verbal attacks.  Okay.  Against father.  Oh, oh, okay.  Was she trying to maybe, how, how old, well, I could do some math, but, uh, was she like  saying things to you to try to turn you around?  Because I know parents getting, getting divorced to separate or whatever, try to do that.  They say things like, ah, your father's a deadbeat or blah, blah, blah, that son of a  bitch.  Yeah. 
[01:15:30]  I mean, there's, whenever his name comes up, there's always a disparaging comment.  Did he ever throw a plate of spaghetti against the wall?  No.  Oh, damn.  That's a good one.  Does he have a new wife?  Uh, no.  A new girl?  He's, uh, he's had some new girls and he's just picked up a new one.  Those are always, uh, ah, I miss that.  Miss what?  Such a treat.  What do you miss?  When my dad would just bring new, his new whores, his new whores after, uh, he finally  got, uh, the boot out of the house.  Mm-hmm.  And he got some small little apartment somewhere and, uh, he'd pick me up for the weekend, 
[01:16:00]  but the weekends were his time to get laid.  Um, so, so he'd have me, my brother, and my sister shoved in his small apartment, laying  all over the living room floor while he was, like, making noises from his bedroom.  Oh, it was awful.  Some, some hose bag would leave in the morning.  Goodbye, Andy and Jonathan and Donna.  It's Anthony Joseph and Dawn Whore.  Get out.  I never got the, uh, the vocal parent thing. 
[01:16:30]  Uh, no?  No, I never got that.  The ball gags?  No, I would go over my, I'd go over my friend's house, like a sleepover or whatever, and we're  watching a movie or whatever, doing something, right?  Yeah.  And you would hear his parents just going at it upstairs.  I'm like, don't they know, first of all, their kid's still up and that the kid has a  friend over?  That's pretty cool.  It was so creepy to me.  Yeah, well, wait a minute, your dad runs out and yells, hey, smell my fingers. 
[01:17:00]  And why wouldn't your dad kind of, like, keep that, like, uh, I don't know, quiet?  I think he was trying, but, you know, you hear, you hear a couple of these, you know.  He can't help it.  You walk in, and she's behind him, he's got his face in the pillow.  Oh, no.  Oh, no, dad.  Oh, daddy.  Now we know why the divorce.  Oh, you better move to California.  So, mother.  Oh, mother, yes. 
[01:17:30]  Get back to mother.  Now you're with mother, your girl, you're in a restaurant, you had a shot, a half a bottle  of wine, your mom likes the wine, you haven't gotten really along for 15 years because of  the divorce thing.  We're now up to what happened.  Yeah, I'm not sure how it came, these things, you know, start.  Yeah.  But, uh, usually with the shots and wine.  Yeah.  But some, uh, I think comment about my dad came up and then I made it might've defended  him.  And then that launched into the, I blame you for everything. 
[01:18:00]  Oh, Jesus.  It all came out.  Had you ever told her that or no?  I don't think I'd ever articulated it like that.  So this could be a breakthrough.  Blunt.  Yeah.  That sounds like a breakthrough.  Um.  And how is your chick?  Was she just like mortified?  Oh, she hates it.  Oh, what an embarrassing kind of a tense situation to be in.  Yeah.  I mean, we've been on and off for, for five years.  So she's well versed in.  Oh, okay.  These sort of things.  And mother.  Yeah.  Mother thing.  Yeah. 
[01:18:30]  And mother's like, I don't want to get into this in front of, you know, your girl.  And I was like, well, you know, she's seen it also.  Don't worry about it.  And then it came into, like, the whole accountability for the divorce thing.  Oof.  She didn't take any, or she didn't take as much responsibility.  She said 50-50.  And I said, I don't agree with that ratio.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Just drinking and yelling at each other.  That's great.  Do you blame your dad for any of it?  Are you, let me ask, are you, are you, are you, my parents aren't divorced, so I don't, 
[01:19:00]  I'm not saying I get it.  Are you unreasonably siding with your dad because you love your dad more, because you  relate to him more?  No.  I mean, I was a mama's boy until, like, 14 or 15.  Can you tell us why you blame mother, or is that too personal?  She would just put him down all the time.  Okay.  That's a big thing, you know.  You can't just sit there and take that crap your whole life off.  You don't want to watch your father emasculated.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Who the hell wants to see that?  For what?  Put him down for what?  Like, just for not making enough money, or? 
[01:19:30]  No.  Being with other women.  And, you know, beating me.  The black eyes, the makeup that she had to wear.  She would always yell at father, he promised an uppercut, gave a left hook.  Uh, his weight was a big one.  Oh, really?  He was a heavy guy.  Yeah.  Really?  You're so slender.  Yeah.  I'm just playing the sociopath that we are talking about.  Yeah, no kidding.  Who's a fitness guru.  No kidding.  So what happens?  You call him fat and stuff and really humiliate him?  Yeah, and, like, give him crap for never being around. 
[01:20:00]  Did he add?  He was kind of, it was one of those self, uh, it was peak listenership, too.  I'm looking at the clock.  That is a good one.  Um, the, uh, like, it was sort of a self-fulfilling thing.  He, she gave him crap for not being around, and since he hated being around, he just worked  more.  Yeah, yeah.  Then you don't come home.  Did mother ever make fun of his manhood?  Oh, Jesus.  Wow, really?  Yeah.  Oh, my God, mother! 
[01:20:30]  Well, like, let me, did she...  It wasn't, it wouldn't be like a whole diatribe, but there'd be, you know, snipings.  Snipings.  About, let's say this, uh, would it be about what he was born with, or would it be about,  uh, how he used it, or how often he used it?  Um, all of those things.  Okay.  Wow, that's emasculating.  Yeah.  She wasn't just being aggressive, she was really hitting below the belt.  She was angry about something.  Yeah, do you, you don't think he was out with other women?  I really don't think so. 
[01:21:00]  You think she resented just the life she'd kind of ended up in?  Yeah.  Maybe, that was it.  Yeah, he had all the, the power because he made the money.  Yeah, and she ended up kind of having to be the mom, and did she have dreams and aspirations  as a, as a kid, or as a younger person?  I mean, she also, she, like, she got an MBA.  Oh, yeah, she, basketball?  The business one.  Oh, okay, sorry.  Was she a career-oriented woman when they met? 
[01:21:30]  No, I mean, they, it was, it was like the 60s, so, I mean, like, it was, the status quo  would, to, her to be the child bearer and raise her.  Yeah.  Okay, so what...  Because I, I'd put, I'd put, if I had a, the percentage thing is interesting.  If I had to put percentage on my parents, the reason they got divorced, I would probably  put 75 on my father, 25 on my mother.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because, like, my father, not a good husband or, or, you know, father. 
[01:22:00]  What was wrong with your dad?  Your mom is hot.  But mom...  Sorry.  I think mom was married too young with the kids and saddled with three kids when she  wanted to be, you know, in her 20s having a good time.  Three kids by the age of what?  Uh, I don't know, probably 23, 24, something like that.  Already three kids.  Yeah, already three kids.  Just, she saddled down.  And one of them was already, what, five or six?  Uh, she had Joe Hurley, right?  Yeah, yeah.  So she's, you know, kind of pissed off that she's, can't have fun. 
[01:22:30]  She's a kid herself and, you know, she gets knocked up and put in this situation.  And then dad is out doing whatever the hell he wants to do.  So she gets pissed at him and then, and then of course, you know, they have to take it out  on each other in front of the kids, which is just a lovely thing.  And it just made me a well-adjusted person.  Yeah.  And that's, that's another thing that came out at dinner was that I was mad at her for,  uh, exposing me to that.  Yeah.  Because in my, uh. 
[01:23:00]  Stupid parents.  She's just, they really are just stupid.  I also got a little annoyed when she's like, well, your brother and sister got over it.  What's your problem?  So being called a whiny bitch by your mom is always nice.  Wow, she's got game, man.  She's got game.  She really does.  She's giving her props.  She does have game.  She, you like mother.  Well.  Do you think mother.  I respect the mother with game.  Trust me.  Do you think mother did any philandering?  I don't think so.  Okay.  All right.  So why the sociopath comment? 
[01:23:30]  Are we up to that point?  Yeah.  Because we got to take a break here.  Yeah.  And that actually wasn't the, the proverbial straw.  Um, the, uh, I, because she wasn't taking responsibility for her actions.  I was calling her a sociopath.  Uh-huh.  Because she was not, like she was disconnected from herself in terms of what she did in the  marriage is why I went for the old sociopath route.  And what happened?  Um, she, that wasn't actually it.  And then we, we argued a little more and she said, well, why are you up here?  And I said something along the lines of, because, you know, you have the house. 
[01:24:00]  Oh my God.  You're nuts.  Oh, this is great.  Look, this is just the tip of the iceberg.  We're going to go back to the fam when we have a little more time.  Oh yeah.  Oh, you're nuts.  Why would you say that?  His, his, his siblings got over it.  Yeah.  I love that one.  Hey, cause.  Oh, what a nasty thing to throw out at you.  And, but he has game two, man.  Yeah.  Yeah.  No, definitely.  I'm here for the house.  And then she's the, she said something and you know, who knows exactly what, but my uppercut 
[01:24:30]  verbally was, look, I don't like you.  Where were you staying?  Cause then tuck, it's not an easy place to get to her house.  Like in the, okay.  So it got really nasty.  And when I said, I don't like you, she said, she stood up, she said, I hope you have some  way of paying for dinner.  And, uh, which is, you know, the last straw at trying to have some sort of influence on 
[01:25:00]  it and, uh, left.  How much was dinner?  $400.  Oh, $400.  Let it be known to the radio audience.  Stan doesn't make the kind of money that he should be, that he could easily pay for a  $400.  No, I'll be floating that one, uh, on Visa for a while.  Oh.  You had a credit card, right?  Yeah.  Oh.  It beats it.  How much therapy?  I didn't have to wash dishes for dinner at least, but like, it's, it's going to be there  for a while.  How much therapy would it have taken to get to that point where you could say that? 
[01:25:30]  You got it out.  You kind of had to get it out.  Oh, I'm throwing money at that cause too, so.  Than is nuts, by the way.  Like people don't know, Than is a kook.  Oh yeah.  Than is a very interesting guy because he's very quiet.  I think a lot of people around here are scared of Than.  Well, he's not, he's not.  Because we know what he could do.  There is not one person that works around us or anything that isn't crazy.  Has something going on.  That isn't a kook.  Yeah.  I used to be worried I was going to be too square for the show and then I realized, oh 
[01:26:00]  yeah, right.  I've seen little bits come out after a couple.  We sit there, loosen up after a couple of drinks and you hear Than will say something  and go like, oh Jesus.  Okay.  He's got some potential.  Well, where did you sleep?  Well, me and my girlfriend thought the best plan of action, because we were also without  a ride at that point.  Oh no.  Was to just throw a whole bunch back, take a cab back late night when she probably was 
[01:26:30]  asleep.  Past time, maybe asleep.  Yeah.  Yeah.  There was less wine in the bottle that we started before dinner.  Did you see your mom the next day then?  No, she left and she went to go do an errand.  I was like, well, let's get while we're getting good.  And we weren't supposed to leave for another day or two, so we just split early.  I tailed it out.  Oh no.  So that's it for a while?  That's it.  Oh yeah.  Hopefully Thanksgiving.  Wow.  You think, wait, wait, you think, but you will see her again. 
[01:27:00]  Yeah.  I'm going to treat her like a parolee now.  Only supervised visits.  So I need, I need like my sister or my brother there with the kids.  The ones that have gotten over it.  Yes.  And their kids.  And their kids.  Yeah.  That's great.  What do you want?  What do you want from her?  Like, what could she do that would make you go, all right, things are kind of.  To take a large chunk of responsibility for, yeah, for the divorce. 
[01:27:30]  And really mean it, not just say it.  Yeah.  That is, that's never happening.  Oh no.  It's a rough one.  Yeah.  All right.  We got to take a break.  We got Adam Ferrara here from Rescue Me and we might be a friend of the show.  Also, we got Seth Green calling in in about a half hour.  There you go, man.  I feel just like a used rag.  As we plug Adam Ferrara and it's like, wait, I spilled my guts out over here.  I know.  I know it works.  Now I got to clean them up.  All I'm thinking is, wow, this is great radio.  Screw it, man. 
[01:28:00]  This is your therapy station.  Yeah.  There's no better place than to lob out your parental problems than on this program.  It's great stuff.  And then have it followed up for a plug for what's coming up next on the show.  Exactly.  That's how disconnected we are.  Oh yeah.  I'm so sorry about your mother.  Take pictures of her.  Put it on your Mac.  Yes, exactly.  You know, old memories that you have of those good times when you were a mama's boy could 
[01:28:30]  be put on a Mac.  All right.  Listen, we got to take a break.  We got to take a break.  We got Adam.  We got Seth Green and we still got to get the answers to two more of these.  Yes.  Two more left.  Two are left.  We got, I told my girlfriend to get all of her crap out of my apartment.  Wow.  And someone wrote down, I got engaged.  If we don't get this done today.  No, no.  We have to.  There will be gunfire.  All right.  It hopefully will be answered next.  It's Opie and Anthony.  It's a very busy show today. 
[01:29:00]  Opie and Anthony, Jim Norton, and now Adam Farrar joining the program.  Hey.  Adam.  Hiya, pal.  From Rescue Me, of course.  Rescue Me?  From my apartment years ago.  I know.  You know, I drove past the other day.  Really?  They fixed the joint up.  There's like a 7-Eleven now.  They took out all their bodies.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The old apartment.  Wow.  Me and Adam hung out back when we worked and didn't work. 
[01:29:30]  Yes.  We were, yeah, pals.  Pals back in our, like, 20s.  We were in country.  Yeah.  We were full of hope.  What are the odds?  Now you're old and full of money.  Look at you.  Unrescue me.  Shut up.  What are the odds that two guys, two roommates, would make an entertainment like that?  Oh, my goodness.  Seriously?  It's got to be maybe eight, nine to one.  Perhaps more than that, Ant.  Or would it be less?  I don't know what's more stupid.  I was asking, Adam, off air there, how did it feel throwing Dennis Leary around last week on Rescue Me? 
[01:30:00]  Yeah, we had the fight scene last week.  That was awesome, man.  I told you.  He doesn't respect my safe word, so I felt dirty.  You say your safe word and he keeps at it.  He keeps at it.  Well, I was wearing the gray in my hair.  It was 100 degrees, and I had all the fire stuff on, and the gray in my hair started, like, kind of, I'm sweating silver.  It is kind of creepy, because they gray up Adam's hair.  Yeah, try to make him look a little older. 
[01:30:30]  But in a strange way.  Like, all of a sudden, he has, like, a patch of gray in the back of his head.  Well, it looked good, but then it was, like, it was sweating through.  Is that what was going on?  The sweat was messing it up?  I usually look like Bob Barker.  Yeah.  Makeup!  Yeah.  Which is ironic, because I'm involved with a group designed to reunite dogs with their testicles.  It's called Nuts for Pups.  I don't think that'll make it through.  Nah.  Probably not.  Made the dump!  But it's a good line.  Rescue me, what, we got two more episodes?  Two more episodes tonight, FX at 10 o'clock. 
[01:31:00]  Tonight, and then next week, we find out who dies, right?  Next Wednesday is the season finale.  Who's going to die this year?  Who's going to die?  I'd say Adam gets killed off.  That's what I think.  Poor Adam.  You better not.  At least he finally put you in rescue me.  We've been wondering what he was going to do.  I know.  He's a good man.  Help out a pal?  He's a good man.  You get my pal on that show.  That's what I did.  I made a phone call.  He's tired of working the funny womb.  I just, you know, it's nice having you around sometimes. 
[01:31:30]  God, it's so nice to buy you.  The guy's all over the road.  He misses all the poker games, everything.  Yeah.  When are we back with the poker?  Oh, I have no idea.  I'm making much too much money at real casinos.  I have much too much money at real casinos to it.  My odds are better.  It's not the home games anymore.  I'm fleecing Indians around the country.  That's it.  You really need to talk to your pal, Anthony.  It's getting a little ugly in the casinos.  I know.  He told me.  $16,000 a hand in blackjack.  Oh, so it's on the air?  Most of it.  Most of it, good.  You have a problem.  I don't see a problem. 
[01:32:00]  I see a problem.  Did he tell you a story?  We came over to shoot some green screen.  Well, did they know about the Magic Basement?  Oh, no.  Actually, I didn't even talk about the Magic Basement.  The Magic Basement.  Anthony, now he's a drunk with a budget.  So he's got all these...  Before, we were just idiots experimenting with stuff.  But now he can put his knowledge with money, which is just dangerous.  You come down, there's helicopters flying in the house.  He's got an entire green screen set up in the basement.  Yeah, he sort of mentioned that he was getting that together.  It's like light boxes and everything. 
[01:32:30]  It's professional lighting systems.  I'm still figuring it out.  But lighting a green screen is very difficult to do.  So I'm becoming educated as I go on.  So I do a little trial and error stuff.  And Adam needed some green screen work.  I happen to have green screen needs.  And I figured, come on over.  We'll green screen.  Right.  We and Adam are green screening.  Yeah.  It's because he needed some video for his website that he had to be isolated from.  So I came down and tried some stuff out with the lighting and everything.  And we was green screening. 
[01:33:00]  We was green screening.  So I call my friend.  Green screening and drinking Bud Light.  And I don't know if those two go together.  It always goes together.  A couple Bud Light, sure.  But I imagine there's a case involved as your green screening.  So Stephen Spielschmuck is sitting over there going, we need to rack focus.  What is that?  I don't know.  Well, let's try it.  I'm going to try it.  So we're shooting all this stuff in the green screen.  And we finish everything.  We go upstairs and we're watching it.  I should have brought the outtakes.  I tried to load it on the iPhone. 
[01:33:30]  Oh, yeah.  To figure it out.  So we're watching the stuff on the green screen.  And he's like, I want to do it again.  We go down.  We do it again.  And we come back up.  And everything I got home, I didn't tell you, most of it's out of focus.  No, it's not.  Part of the pixels.  You did something wrong with my pixels.  Oh, you messed up his pixels.  You either got to go, you got to change the dimension of the picture.  Okay.  Why, are you getting ragged edges?  Did you just meet me?  Are you getting, are you getting, look who you're talking to.  Are you getting ragged edges? 
[01:34:00]  Yes.  Okay.  That isn't a problem with what I shot.  It's a problem with the size format that you're editing.  The setting of the editing.  I'm not kidding.  Why did you need green screen?  Why don't you do this?  Why don't you say this to me?  I went 16-9.  I went 16-9.  Uh-huh.  Aspect ratio.  Are you done?  Aspect ratio.  Thank you, Jimmy Norton.  Okay.  Are you done? 
[01:34:30]  Yeah.  Okay, good.  I can't pull anything over his eyes.  Why were you green screening?  I had this idea.  My website.  My MySpace is in good shape.  What is it?  What is it?  What is it?  MySpace.  It looks like it's done in this century.  Yeah.  My other website is like written on papyrus.  Yeah, yeah.  So I had to redo the other website.  So I had an idea about green screen where I come into the...  It's pretty cool, the idea.  It comes flying onto the screen.  It comes flying onto the screen.  It's pretty cool.  Like Peter Pan?  No, no, no.  Are you in a gay way?  Like Superman? 
[01:35:00]  Are you green screening like Peter Pan?  Kind of like a...  It's a magic basement?  Yeah, I have harnesses and pulley systems.  Yeah.  Working out a song.  Here's Adam.  And I'm the Sandy Duncan Peter Pan, so I knock out an eye.  Chasing a glass eyeball in a little green suit.  Peanut butter.  Follow me to my tour dates.  Wait.  By the way, this is not my fault because they're yelling and screaming on the instant feedback.  It's not my fault.  They're talking about green screening in Anthony's magic basement.  We're getting a little conversation about my magic basement. 
[01:35:30]  Okay, fine.  And Anthony has a betting problem.  Yes, he does.  No.  Yeah.  Doesn't seem to be a problem.  Doesn't seem to be a bet.  Bet.  Bet.  Bet.  Bet.  Bet.  Bet.  Bet.  Bet.  Bet.  Bet.  Bet.  Bet.  Bet.  Bet.  Bet.  Bet.  Bet.  Bet.  Bet.  Bet.  Bet.  Bet.  Bet.  Bet.  Bet.  Bet.  Bet.  Bet.  He goes, I just went, I took the Indians for money.  I'm like, what?  What did you do?  He goes, I hit for, what did you hit for?  Oh, it was, let's just say it was a pretty good chunk.  Yeah.  We don't say the numbers anymore.  We don't say the numbers.  No.  No.  He made much wampum.  And one eye starts spinning one way and one eye starts spinning the other way. 
[01:36:00]  And then he's like, we got to go, pal.  We got to go.  And I'm like, that's what it was.  Fred Flintstone.  Bet.  Bet.  Bet.  Bet.  Bet.  Bet.  Bet.  Bet.  Bet.  Bet.  Bet.  Bet.  Bet.  Bet.  He's really into it.  And then I was just down in Atlantis.  Really?  Yeah.  How'd you do?  How'd you do?  But see, now we're talking about another country involved.  You did good in Atlantis.  Ix nae on Atlantis A.  Oh, a few of us are still walking a little funny. 
[01:36:30]  Really?  Having a rat hole some money.  Oh, I thought you were down there with a senator.  No, I'm teasing.  No, it was very good.  Had a great time.  And of course, the casino's wonderful.  Yeah.  When you win, it's all wonderful.  It's great.  You catch me when I fall, pal.  I know.  I've been there when you fall.  What happened at Do Me A Favor?  Sometimes he gets like a werewolf.  Just chain me to this radiator.  Whatever you hear, don't let me out.  Should we put the show on hold so you can tell Adam what happened in Atlantis? 
[01:37:00]  What happened in Atlantis?  Oh.  Maybe we should just move on.  Oh, oh, for the, uh, uh, what, um, yeah, okay, put the show on hold real quick.  All right, we need some hold music.  Wow.  We have that.  Hit that.  That's some hold music.  We'll be right back with the Opian Anthony Program.  Are you out of your mind? 
[01:37:30]  Come on, it was great.  In this day and age?  It was a great.  We're back with the Opian Anthony Program.  It was a great adventure.  Oh, my God. 
[01:38:00]  All right, next time I'm picking up the phone, I'm sorry, man.  I didn't know.  I thought it was just some more wacky crap, like, I bought another car, and I just couldn't  hear it and then.  Nah.  Hey, let's move on with the radio stuff.  Sending my car out to Vegas.  Really?  I got my letter and call from Shelby.  You got a car that drives itself?  No, my Shelby.  Yeah.  It's going out to Vegas.  It's coming back with 725 horsepower.  You want to know something?  Now even the car has a gambling problem.  Let it be noted.  I'm trying to move on, because I don't want to be blamed for this. 
[01:38:30]  We got two big announcements left that people wrote down yesterday, things that happened  to them on vacation, Adam.  Got it.  The two that are left, I told my girlfriend to get all of her crap out of my apartment,  and finally, someone wrote down, I got engaged.  Wow, that is like two separate things there, huh?  Oh, boy, is it.  Uh-huh.  Well, obviously, we got to go with the, I told my girlfriend to get all of her crap  out of my apartment. 
[01:39:00]  And?  Hmm.  Yes, James.  Jimmy raised his hand.  That means you wrote down two.  Yeah, yeah.  It's a good fear.  He wrote down two.  He threw everyone off, because I'm thinking it wasn't Jimmy, because I thought he was the  one that said I effed a blank.  Yeah, yeah.  From yesterday.  Well, what happened?  We just had a, we were doing great. 
[01:39:30]  And then she was bitching at me one day about something about how I slept too late, and  I could feel myself getting physically angry.  Like, we're walking.  Oh, boy.  And I started saying, you're a baby.  You're a baby.  And she's like, maybe we should just part ways.  And I'm like, okay.  And I tapped her arm.  Like, I'm not.  Like, you tagged out?  Yeah, I absolutely tagged out.  You tagged out.  And I walked away, and I was so angry, I started texting.  I can't think when I'm that angry. 
[01:40:00]  Yeah.  And then, so she's not really responding, and I finally get her on the phone, and she's  just being a C, and I'm being an MF, and whatever it was, I said, just come get your crap out  of my apartment.  And she came back.  Wow.  And got all of it.  All right, stuff out.  Except for one bag of laundry, because she couldn't carry it.  You know, I wasn't a...  Oh, my God.  At least you should tell her, hey, that's not my problem.  Get it out.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, it was ugly.  So, are you done? 
[01:40:30]  I don't know.  How long ago was this?  Three days.  Has she had any contact in the three days?  Yeah.  Why the look?  I should say, yeah.  Because I forgot what side of the radio we were on.  I almost said what we did last night.  Oh.  Oh, okay.  Two nights ago.  All right.  Yeah.  Okay.  It was very ugly.  Very thin ice we're skating on.  Whatever.  It is what it is.  But you're not.  She got her stuff out of the house.  But you're still skating.  That's pretty much it. 
[01:41:00]  You're still skating.  You're still a lot.  The guy's a little thin.  But you're skating.  It's like you...  Yeah, her stuff's still out of the apartment.  You changed your mind about resigning?  Is that it?  I don't know.  I don't know if she is either.  All right.  Well, when we get on the other side, I want to hear what happened.  We were hugging each other.  And it was like...  It might as well have just been two library gargoyles.  The lack of intimacy that was passing between us.  Well, you're still angry.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And she's still angry.  Who cares?  Let her be angry.  You do.  Look at your little face.  No, no, no.  I care that I'm angry.  I don't care that she is. 
[01:41:30]  You really don't?  She doesn't have a point with her anger?  No.  No.  I'm just asking.  I don't know.  No, no, no.  I know.  I'm just saying.  Look...  I just love how Jimmy gets like that.  I know, I know.  He was so...  He relived that anger right there when he said,  I was so...  I could feel myself.  Because we got together later that day.  Before she came and got her stuff, we were quiet.  Because I was like pleased.  I was so angry.  I was afraid I'd do something stupid.  And then that night, I saw her and we tried to talk in the city.  And we started fighting on the corner of West 3rd and McDougal. 
[01:42:00]  Arguing.  That's a good fight spot.  And I felt myself going beyond the point of no return with anger.  Like, I saw...  Where you would just start saying things that are...  That you can never, ever take back.  Yeah.  And you don't really meet because you're in that state.  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  But I comprehend this.  What it's like just to strike a person...  Of course, I didn't do it.  I've never hit a chick.  Ever.  But I understand how somebody, in a moment, 
[01:42:30]  how all of a sudden you could look and go,  that's my arm flashing out with a fist at the end of it.  Wow.  I had to walk away.  You had to step away.  I had to walk away.  At least you went away.  Oh, yeah.  I was on West...  It was a corner of West 3rd and McDougal.  What'd you do?  Did you go to a CD store?  A cellar.  Bought some Mike Turner?  Oh, I would love to.  Did you do a set at the cellar after this?  Yeah, I was shaking.  I had to walk on stage.  I was so angry.  I thought I was just going to go on and just trash women.  I mean, I did okay, but I was really... 
[01:43:00]  That's your belt of whiskey, hitting the stage.  That's like what Jimmy's got to do.  Anyone else would just start drinking.  You know, Jimmy's got to...  I got to hit the stage.  Yeah, then afterwards you got to ride around and do other things.  You know, this would be a suggestion.  Let's just say confession number one.  Say how it all ties in.  Hey, that's why...  Yeah, okay.  That's why you got to linger longer with this show.  All right.  Linger longer.  As well.  Nate Sack from Wagbag.  Jimmy's breakup is wholeheartedly supported by Wagbag, as we can now look forward to stories 
[01:43:30]  of debauchery once again and another book opportunity.  Well...  But he's still skating.  He's skating on very thin ice.  I think you're not really gone yet.  No.  I just...  We just don't know.  I have therapy today.  My therapist has been on for a month, so I got to sit there like a rock in the car.  I can't cry in therapy.  It's awful.  Oh, please.  Mine?  Mine's ridiculous.  Hey, remember, last time I was here, Anthony, he asked me, he goes, how's it going with that  shrink?  And I'm like, he didn't get nothing out of me.  I love my mother. 
[01:44:00]  I ain't going to roll on her.  And it comes up, and then I change the subject.  I get ADD about emotional ADD, like I feel a feeling, and I'm like, oh, that's not coming  out.  Let me...  Look at the shiny thing over there.  Yeah.  Jeez.  See?  That's what I was saying.  Everyone's crazy.  Yeah.  I don't think I could do that therapy thing.  I think you're crazy.  It's been suggested over the years.  I don't think I could do it.  Why?  Because I know they're on the clock.  That's what's good about...  I think that's part of their gig, though.  That's what's good about...  But they're on the clock, and I'm like, how could they actually care about what I'm saying if  they're looking at the clock, because they got appointments, just like a dentist has 
[01:44:30]  cleanings to do.  Yeah.  One after another.  I get...  That's my whole thing I can't get past.  I'm like, how do they...  They don't give a crap.  They can't sit there for five hours with you.  How do you get a massage?  It's the same thing, in a way.  Good point, yeah.  My therapist even...  Yeah.  At the end, she's a good egg, isn't she?  Oh, my God.  She's like, I saw a tear.  No, but therapy, that's the beauty of it, is that they don't care.  They care on a certain level.  They're not monsters, but the bottom line is their emotional selfishness is not invading 
[01:45:00]  their advice.  Right.  They are really coming at you from a detached point of view, so they can kind of give you  honesty, whether you like it or not.  That's what I like about them.  Well, my thing is strip clubs, same as therapy.  I don't like the strip clubs for the most part, because I know the girl's not really into  you.  And therapy, same thing.  They have no real interest in you.  Some people like that whole, you know, give her a buck and she takes her clothes off.  That's where I come from, though.  But I know as soon as the song is over, they're moving on. 
[01:45:30]  Moving on from your little lap dance.  Unless you're paying for another song, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, but by therapy...  But the whole time while they're dancing during the song, they're acting like they want to,  you know, have a little thing with you.  Yeah.  Therapy's good, but I think you would like it.  I think you'd be very open for it, actually.  You're pretty open with stuff like that.  I'd say therapy and drugs ruin this show, if I ever went therapy or drugs.  No, really.  No.  Don't do drugs.  No.  That would work things.  No, I mean, like the, you know, the ones that...  Prescription drugs.  Yes, thank you.  Oh, yeah.  I don't want you with that white crap in the corner. 
[01:46:00]  Heroin.  It's the Opian Anthony show and everything's good.  Everything's fine and dandy.  It's medicine, right.  All right.  Yeah, see, look.  Let it be noted.  Oh, no.  That fan is the party pooper.  Are we going to have to take a break?  Fan, you held up the break sign because they give me crap.  They give me crap.  Wow.  All right.  Anything else to the, I told my girlfriend to get all of her crap out of my apartment?  No, no.  She did. 
[01:46:30]  That bag of laundry's still sitting there.  All right.  Up next, Seth Green from Family Guy.  I bet it's even dirtier now.  Yeah, it is.  Especially after what I scrapped into it.  I figured.  Nice panties, whore.  That's the first place he's taken his anger out.  Yeah.  That laundry.  You know she could be listening right now, Jimmy.  She's a lovely girl.  She is a lovely girl, but she's passed out like a junkie right now.  Face down, she was reading some filthy story of O.  What?  What?  That book on bondage she bought.  Just to look at it because it was a classic book. 
[01:47:00]  I don't even know the book.  It's a very classic, perverted book.  Yeah?  Yeah.  All right.  So hopefully she'll.  Oh my God.  If we don't go to a break, I'm going to kill somebody.  These people are getting so angry.  And we got lots of women on Pal Talk Wow at all morning.  Yes.  So thanks to them today.  It is Whip Them Out Wednesday.  Adam Farrar, rescue me tonight on FX.  10 o'clock.  Two episodes left.  This is the big one before the season finale where probably someone dies because every 
[01:47:30]  year someone dies at the end there, right?  We'll see.  I'm going to get something out of here, Adam.  We'll see.  And Adam's going to be at West Palm Beach Improv.  Really?  This Thursday through Sunday?  I leave the show and get on a plane.  Oh, yeah.  And we're on at West Palm Beach.  Jimmy's healing.  Yeah, he sure is.  So much for the girlfriend, right, Jimmy?  Yeah.  Oh, she loved that, by the way.  My acknowledgement in the book, like under acknowledgements.  I said, thanks to all the girls on Pal Talk who have helped me scrap, you know, whatever.  And she said, that was nice to put in your book. 
[01:48:00]  I'm like, just shut up.  Oh, God.  Oh.  That was the...  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  You got created...  I got that once.  She goes, you're not going to do that joke about me on Letterman.  I'm like, you like the house?  Where do you think all this stuff comes?  Absolutely.  What do you think?  Bed Bath & Beyond sends all this crap over here?  That's the problem she had with happy endings?  Was the acknowledgement of Pal Talk?  No, no.  Well, and what I do when I look at girls on Pal Talk, no, that was the acknowledgement.  That was the one she spit at me.  I think she knew she couldn't go up to book content. 
[01:48:30]  So she went after that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That was good.  All right.  So for everybody listening in West Palm Beach, because we're on down there.  Yes.  Let's not forget, Adam Farrar leaving the show in a little while and getting on a plane.  And he'll be at the Improv Thursday through Sunday.  And I'm sorry our time is up.  We have to go to a break.  We'll see you next week for your therapy.  Well, we got the final one.  Someone wrote down yesterday that they got engaged.  Do we find out next?  Do we?  I hope so.  We have to.  It's hoping, Anthony. 
[01:49:00]  Welcome back to the Opie and Anthony program.  Opie is a mouthful of wine.  It's a line bringing us back to break.  And we were going to have Seth Green.  He is very gracefully.  He's going to call tomorrow because we're so behind.  You don't want to just blow Seth off.  And, of course, Adam Farrar is going to be at the West Palm Beach Improv tonight through Sunday, I think.  Yes.  Is that correct, Adam? 
[01:49:30]  Yes, correct.  Tomorrow.  Tomorrow?  Thursday.  Thursday through Sunday.  I said tonight, and you said correct.  It's my fault.  All right.  Go tonight and stand on line.  Tonight's rescue me with Adam Farrar.  Yes.  It stars Adam Farrar.  I knew there was something tonight.  My pal.  There you go, champ.  Finally.  Ah.  What do you got?  We are down to the last little thing that happened to one of us during vacation. 
[01:50:00]  Hmm.  Now, Jimmy Norton has exposed that he had two.  Yeah.  It's interesting.  Somebody got engaged over vacation.  Yep.  Someone in this very room.  A lot of speculation has been going on for the last couple of days.  Is engaged.  Yes.  Engaged to be married. 
[01:50:30]  To be wed.  Who wrote down, I got engaged?  Who wrote down, I got engaged?  Who wrote down, I got engaged?  Who did it?  I know who didn't do it.  Who did it?  That would be me.  E-Rock!  E-Rock!  E-Rock!  Wow.  Are you pregnant?  No. 
[01:51:00]  Shotgun?  No.  So, E-Rock, you got engaged.  Yes.  How did you ask?  Yes.  Please let us know.  Details.  I did it at the magical world of Disney.  Another one.  You were at Disney?  Yeah.  I know you don't like the movie.  You're marrying a 12-year-old?  Where at Disney were you when you said it? 
[01:51:30]  We were at Cinderella's Castle.  Right in the center of the Magic Kingdom.  Ah, it's getting gayer.  Did you kneel down and ask?  No, I couldn't.  In the area that I was in, I couldn't kneel down.  Why not?  Why?  Not allowed?  No kneeling?  Your pants were too tight?  No, because...  Somebody was tapping their foot.  What do you mean you can't kneel down?  Kneel down anywhere.  Because the front and part of the side was set up for a stage show. 
[01:52:00]  So the only area available was right off to the side of the castle there where they had this wishing well.  Did you do it when Jaws popped out of the water?  Why are you shaking?  Why are you shaking?  Put your hand up.  Put your hand up.  Oh my God, he is shaking talking about this.  Why are you shaking?  I don't know.  Oh my God.  Did you do it in Pirates of the Caribbean?  No, but I actually...  Did you have the big ears on?  Did you cry?  No. 
[01:52:30]  Did she?  Yes, she did.  Is she a big Disney fan?  She hadn't been since she was 12.  So I figured this might be something to do.  I don't know why I'm freaking out right now.  Oh my God.  This is great.  Stand up.  Oh, the freaking out Iraq.  Stand up.  He's going to faint.  He's having a stroke.  No, he's not...  Stand up.  Thanks, Sam.  Oh, he's crying.  Oh, Iraq.  Oh, there's no crying in proposing. 
[01:53:00]  Poor Eric.  Well, let's go.  Iraq did tear up when he proposed.  Come on.  I didn't, but I think it just hit.  Oh, look at Iraq.  Is it happiness or is it terror?  Yeah.  Let me tell you about a little crying I did.  It was after my wedding.  Oh, about 10 years later.  It lasted for nine years.  She just saw your bank statement and she's in her office crying.  Did I say yes?  Iraq, why are you crying?  Iraq.  So, Eric, what happened?  You, you, you, you... 
[01:53:30]  That's great.  How did you ask her?  Who wrote, I love you cuddles?  That would be Derek after he called me an effing homo.  Okay.  No, good for you.  All right.  I mean, look, there's a big moment in your life.  There's you.  There's the jamboree bears in front of you.  So, what happened, Eric?  I'm still going to interrupt you.  Wait.  Oh, my God.  He can't even think.  He's gone.  He is gone.  He can't even think.  He's gone.  Wow.  So, what happened?  He's like Jimmy when he gets angry. 
[01:54:00]  Yeah, walk us through this.  Just blacked out.  All right.  So, we get there.  By the way, his girl is awesome.  Yeah, she's great.  Oh, hell yeah.  We love her.  Not that that matters.  Yeah.  Because you're not marrying us.  You're marrying her.  But it should be said from somebody that you found an awesome woman there.  Yes, I'm very lucky.  So, you get there.  You knew you were going to ask her?  Yeah.  This was all set up a couple months in advance.  And so, we get there.  I'm trying to remember everything.  We get there. 
[01:54:30]  I've never seen him this effed up in my life.  Wow.  You get there.  So, we get there.  Yeah, you got there.  We get to the front office.  I said, oh, we got to get a map for the kingdom and everything.  So, I go in there.  It's a range where I'm going to meet up.  So, they have photographers following us.  Right?  That's cool.  Yeah.  But she has no idea.  She just thought you were famous.  No, she didn't.  Wait, you could set this up ahead of time.  And then they have kind of like paparazzi dudes that are undercover that will just follow 
[01:55:00]  and make sure they get shots all day.  That's kind of cool.  Yeah, you tell them where you want to do it, where you're going, when.  And you don't even realize.  But then there's this like whole entourage kind of maybe 50 feet behind you blending in  with the crowd.  So, we get over to the castle.  And we see a lot of the areas are blocked off because of the stage show.  So, we go all the way around to where the wishing well is.  The wishing well.  The wishing well. 
[01:55:30]  Wishing well.  Who was that?  Terrence?  Terrence, Trent Robbie.  Yeah.  So, they give you suggestions of what to do, where to do it, certain parts of the kingdom.  So, we're at the wishing well.  You have these coins, right?  Oh, no.  So, Danny's shaking his head.  And if it doesn't work out, she gets half of them.  So, she's watching the stage show. 
[01:56:00]  There's fireworks going off and everything.  Aw.  Aw.  Come on.  Go ahead.  So, you give her the coin.  And I have one of these coins.  So, I'm just leaning over the well and I throw it in.  And I'm like, okay, it's your turn.  Make a wish.  And you disappeared?  All of a sudden, he's taller and black with a much bigger ball than his pants.  I'm sorry.  That's not what happened.  Yeah, of course.  Apologize.  Sorry to the blacks out there for that positive stereotype, by the way. 
[01:56:30]  Go ahead.  I apologize ahead of time.  So, you throw your thing in and you say to her, make a wish.  Yeah, make a wish.  So, she takes her coin, throws it in there and make a wish.  And then you heard a bunch of goonies yelling at the bottom of the well.  This was my coin.  This is our time.  Down here.  At that point, all of a sudden, you had the urge to just jump in.  She throws her coin. 
[01:57:00]  I have to.  Yes.  She throws her coin in.  She throws her coin in.  So, I ask her, so, what did you wish for?  So, she's like, I can't tell you that.  And I said, why not?  She goes, then it won't come true.  And then.  She popped her in the head.  No.  Okay.  Sorry.  Out of luck, more fireworks went off from that stage show.  So, she turned around.  Right?  She's looking up at the fireworks.  Always with the fireworks.  And then she turns around back to me.  And I go, was this what you wished for? 
[01:57:30]  And I have the ring out.  Right?  Now, the well is.  She says, no.  You don't give her a question like that.  All of a sudden, that door opens.  You open it, and it's a bag like our Bud Dwyer had.  And you put the gun in your mouth.  And she goes, that's more like it.  I'm sorry.  That's not what happened.  All right.  Sorry.  I apologize.  This is very romantic.  Yes, it is.  It is.  We don't know how to handle emotion.  We really are a bunch of ghouls.  Yes.  We suck.  We don't know how to handle the ring.  So, you show her the ring and say, is this what you wished for? 
[01:58:00]  Yes.  And what did she say?  She kind of freaked out.  So, she's like, oh my God, yes.  She says, yes.  Now, the well is up about five feet.  So, it's a very small enclosed area.  There's really nowhere for you to kneel.  Or to hang yourself.  Yeah.  So, right as I'm doing this, the photographers come out of the crowd and start taking shots  of while, no, I'm giving her the ring.  She's freaking out, crying.  Put the ring on. 
[01:58:30]  Give her a kiss.  And that was it.  And they send you on your way.  No kneeling or nothing.  Couldn't in that area.  This is too small.  So, you knew you wanted to marry this girl.  Were you nervous she was going to say no?  Or did you know?  No, I didn't think she'd say no.  And I told her this, too.  I didn't think she'd say no.  But I thought she might say, I need a little time to think about this.  Oh, that's a no.  You know you just entered a lifetime of exercise and eating right, right?  Oh, yeah. 
[01:59:00]  She's no disrespect to you.  She's way hotter than you deserve.  So, you had better eat right and stay in shape, or she will.  Oh, my God.  I'm saying that.  You don't want to.  This just coming in on the display on all the XM units, it just says, E-Rock's doomed.  Oh, that is not nice.  Thanks, sir.  And this should be said, too.  We got bakers from all over the country just begging to be the cake maker for E-Rock's wedding.  You can retire. 
[01:59:30]  So, you asked her to marry you, and you said, did you say, will you marry me?  Yes, I did.  And she said yes.  Yes.  That's nice.  And cue the dwarfs, take the pictures.  It was kind of hard to get an idea of her emotion, because she had these big sunglasses on,  and pretty much you just see tears coming out the side of the glasses,  but it blocks the rest of her face, so you can't really see that she was all into it. 
[02:00:00]  Someone is suggesting that you should have proposed on the Dumbo ride.  Nothing.  That was inbred.  That was inbred.  Pennsylvania.  So, she was crying when you asked her.  Yes.  And she said yes.  Did someone suggest to the family, you're not losing a daughter, you're gaining a ton?  Oh, Ralph.  So, that's the answer to the big mystery E-Rock wrote down.  E-Rock.  That he got engaged.  Is there a date?  No, not yet. 
[02:00:30]  No date is set.  Where's the honeymoon?  Epcot?  E-Rock, I hate to do this to you, but I also got engaged.  Oh, no.  Oh, my God.  Who cares how about E-Rock's engagement?  Wait a minute.  Where'd you do it?  Oh, no.  No one's going to remember that E-Rock got engaged.  Enough about you, fat boy.  I hope he went to Adventureland and farmed you. 
[02:01:00]  Engaged in the bumper cars.  Honey, can I bang you around for the rest of your life?  Hey, good luck.  Did someone treat marriage like an adult?  Going into vacation, I knew I was going to get engaged, and I just started laughing because  I heard rumors that E-Rock was also going to get engaged over vacation.  I'm like, poor E-Rock.  Always handing out tear-stained pieces of paper.  So, Opie, you took the plunge? 
[02:01:30]  Well, I got engaged, yeah.  Oh.  Yeah, and I'm beyond psyched, to be completely honest with you.  A lot of people listening to this radio show, they get confused, but I always believed in  the wedding thing and the kid thing and stuff, and, you know, I'm going to go for it.  Wedding tour, kid.  E-Z!  E-Z!  You know how I found out about it is I happened to be walking, because Opie and I live very  close to each other.  Yeah.  So, I see Lindsay across the street, and I don't recognize her because she's waving at  me, and I don't think there's a girl in the neighborhood waving at me. 
[02:02:00]  I don't know anybody in the neighborhood.  So, I'm like, I pointed at me, and it was her with her hair up.  I'm like, oh, it's Lindsay.  So, I walk over, and we say hello.  I'm like, well, how was your trip?  Do you have a nice time?  And she's like, yeah.  Did you talk to Greg?  And I'm like, uh.  Greg?  Who the hell is Greg?  Yeah.  But then I'm like, what happened?  That's never good.  I was like, if I thought something happened, that was bad.  And I'm like, no, why?  Is everything all right?  And she's like, yeah.  And she has the worst poker face.  She has no ability.  She told me later she went into panic mode. 
[02:02:30]  She's hiding her hand.  Yeah, it was amazing.  It was like she stole something.  I'm like, I know there's a hand there.  I know the human.  How is she hiding that Buick behind?  I saw.  I'm like.  You guys should be happy.  I can't F up this show anytime soon.  We didn't say the word, but I knew what happened.  I'm like, really?  Congratulations.  And I looked at what was on her finger, and I said, I hope you realize that's New  York, Boston, Philly, Chicago, and three cities to be named later. 
[02:03:00]  So it was job security.  I've never been happier to see her ring.  To see her ring that big.  Oh, I'm so happy.  And yeah, there's rumors.  She's not pregnant.  Stop with that crap, please.  I beg of you.  But no, I've been with Lindsay for like three years now, and I'm beyond happy.  And yeah, it was down in the Outer Banks, pretty much right in front of her family.  That's great.  About 100 to 150 yards down the beach.  E-Rock did that, but her family are dwarves.  A lot of people suggesting this, and I think this is a great idea. 
[02:03:30]  A Brady wedding?  A double wedding.  A Brady wedding?  A double wedding like the Bradys had.  E-Rock and Opie.  This played out perfectly, because a lot of people started thinking it was me on the message  boards, but then they're thinking it was E-Rock, and it was E-Rock, and then they thought  it was over, and then bam!  I never wrote anything down.  That was the beauty of the pit.  That's what happened.  E-Rock, when did you know that I got engaged, too?  Yesterday? 
[02:04:00]  Sure.  When did you know?  Just now.  Oh, really?  You didn't even know until just now?  You didn't know?  I guess we can keep a secret around here.  Wow.  I only told a couple people, because I wanted to do it in this way.  So will my sister Dawn be presiding over anyone's nuptials?  Or presiding?  Oh, presiding.  Sorry.  Yeah.  You know, so it was awesome.  It was a good time down there in the Outer Banks, and I'm very happy.  Yeah.  Marrying a Philly girl.  God bless you. 
[02:04:30]  That should help the Philly ratings.  Any day.  Yeah.  See?  That's how you ask in front of a family.  Because, look, I love your daughter, but as you know, the trends have not been good.  This will get them talking down in Philly.  Oh, no.  Come on.  Now you're right.  Yeah, you're officially like Philly.  Yeah.  Yeah.  No, I can't talk any sense into them.  It was funny.  People are saying, no.  Hey, everyone's different, you know.  I can't wait to see the difference in gifts that everyone gets for Ulp. 
[02:05:00]  Oh, no.  Not that there's going to be any financial difference in my gift to you, as there is  to the boss who provides everything, including my mortgage for me.  The beauty is I announce my engagement to my fiancée.  Your fiancée.  Where's my fiancée?  She's French.  On her first day of school.  Okay, that's creepy.  Do you realize, as you were saying, I want to spend the rest of my life with you, I was 
[02:05:30]  going, get your shit and get out.  Whoops.  Whoops.  All right, well.  And no, I did not put the ring in a bikini-tini.  The drink of this vacation was the Magic Marlin.  Oh, a Magic Marlin.  We'll talk about that tomorrow.  We went to the bikini-tini bar to celebrate a little bit with her whole family, and guess 
[02:06:00]  what?  New owners, no more bikini-tinis down there in the Outer Banks.  Ah, boy.  Lucky for me.  You don't have a date set yet, do you?  Nah.  Any ballpark figure date.  You know what I love about this?  Because everyone forgot about Schmucko over there.  Oh, wait.  Iraq got engaged.  Did you get engaged?  I remember hearing something about that.  Where was it?  Where did you...  Iraq was all excited, and he finally has a moment on that show, and it just gets true.  A moment that brought him to tears. 
[02:06:30]  Poor Eric.  He was shaking, and then Eric's a very emotional...  He is a very emotional sweet boy.  He's a sweet guy.  Hey, wow.  We've got to get off this side of the show, but we've got Rob Bartlett on the phone.  Rob.  Hey, too.  It's a magical morning.  Bob Bartlett from Imus' show.  He needs a little help with the gig, right, Rob?  Yeah.  Rob, of course, the guy who did all the great impressions, one of the funniest guys from  Imus' show, doing the Calhoun Cafe in Saugus, Massachusetts. 
[02:07:00]  I'm just throwing the plug out real quick in case they cut us anywhere.  Saugus, Massachusetts, this Saturday.  Rob's a great stand-up.  Dude, how are you, man?  I'm good.  How are you?  Thanks for the little bump in your book.  Oh, of course, man.  Yeah, I mentioned, you know, my pal.  It was hard to read holding it with one hand.  You like the book?  It was, I can't wait for the movie.  Dude, is there anything going on with the show?  I mean, of course, everybody wants to know what's going on behind the scenes with Imus  and the whole situation.  Well, I've been busy.  I've been working on my cabaret act, mostly Mercer, at Put-in-Pants in Soho, and green screen 
[02:07:30]  with Adam Farrar.  You've got to come down and green screen with me.  Rob, actually, I was in an improv group when I first started with Rob, and I learned so  much, and he's a brilliant comic, so please go see him.  Where is he at, Jimmy?  Calhoun Cafe.  I'm going to just throw out the number, too.  The Comedy Connection Calhoun there.  Yeah, I call it Calhoun Cafe.  What a fruit I am.  The Comedy Connection, I've done it.  It's 617-248-9700.  It's September the 15th.  It's this Saturday, I believe.  It's two.  And, Rob, have you been in touch with Imus? 
[02:08:00]  Have you guys been chit-chatting?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  We call every night.  That would be a big no.  Rob, you should come in and do the show.  Okay, cool.  We would like to have you in.  Like, tomorrow.  I would like to see the new studio.  Oh, it's wonderful.  It's a duplicate of the CBS station.  Rob, we've got to get off this side of the show.  We just want to get the plug-in fast, but either call in tomorrow or come in, and we  could, like, catch up a little bit.  Why don't you come in?  That's great.  No, I'm serious.  Well, we'll have Iraq call you. 
[02:08:30]  I'll do it.  Come in.  I'll be there, honey.  All right, Rob.  All right, Rob.  Take care, Rob.  We'll talk to Rob more tomorrow.  We're just...  Yes.  I've run out of this.  It'll be good to see Rob.  He is a great comic, and if you're in Massachusetts, don't be an ass.  Go to see him and support him, because he was wrongly fired.  Comedy Connection, Kowloon, in Saugus.  You know what?  Fast Freddy from Jamaica Station.  He goes, I bet Opie cried.  Let me tell you something.  I did.  Good for you.  I did.  I have no problem admitting that.  The tears were kind of, like, dried up by the time we went back to the family, but 
[02:09:00]  then a few more were shed, because it was a very happy moment.  Yeah, of course.  The whole family, the whole Philly...  Ah!  The whole Philly crew, big time into this.  Big time.  Good.  That's great.  And it was really, really good to see.  Were they all crying, too?  Our brothers, and I met her dad.  Everybody was just...  Just a big, blubbering house of nice people.  Well, because then it was on a beach, which was perfect for me.  It was perfect for her, because it was in front of her family.  And then it was a huge celebration, as the sun is going down for the rest of the day with  Dom Perignon, that I snuck down there, and beers, and music. 
[02:09:30]  You know who's crying now?  It was awesome.  Stalker Patty.  Yeah.  Suicide watch.  It's over Stalker Patty.  You had Sunset Family and Magic Fish Drinks.  He had the teacups.  Who?  Who were you referring to?  Oh, that's right.  I forgot.  All right, E-Rock, congratulations on whatever you announced today.  I forgot already.  Something about that.  I don't know.  Adam, West Palm Beach Improv starting tomorrow through Sunday, and Rescue Me Tonight with  our pal Dennis Leary on FX, 10 o'clock. 
[02:10:00]  Thanks, brother.  All right, we've got to get out of here.  We'll see you guys tomorrow.  Goodbye.  Goodbye.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Did we lose Adam?  No.  Here we are.  It's Opie and Anthony on XM Satellite Radio. 
[02:10:30]  Radio.  Radio.  Can I tell you when Ecstasy of the Gold started?  Ecstasy of the Gold?  Is that what it's called?  Ecstasy of the Gold.  Whatever.  It just sounded funny how you said it.  Ecstasy of the Gold.  Of the Gold.  Of the Gold.  When Ecstasy of the Gold started, I decided to check my email on my iPhone.  Yes.  I was going to say I love the iPhone, but I don't have an iPhone.  Fantastic iPhone.  Yeah.  It is still trying to open the sign-in page. 
[02:11:00]  To, um...  Because they went with the slower web.  Why did they go with the slow...  Can somebody call me?  Please, a tech guy.  Explain why fucking Steve Jobs went with the slower web service.  We know why he went with AT&T.  Because they're a cunt service, and he could straddle their shoulders and fuck their mouths,  and they would take it.  We all know that's why he went with AT&T. 
[02:11:30]  Because Verizon had self-esteem.  They're like, no, we're not giving you a piece of the phone calls.  Can I be the moderator, by the way?  I find this hilarious because we have two people, two main people from the Opie and Anthony show  that have iPhones.  Two out of the three here, right?  Yeah.  Anthony loves his iPhone.  Can't get enough of his iPhone.  Talks about it all the time to the point where we're like, all right, enough about the iPhone.  We get it.  And then you got Jimmy in this other corner here that can't stand it. 
[02:12:00]  And he's minutes away from throwing it out this window.  But I will say this.  Technologically, it's an amazing thing.  What annoys me so, it makes me livid beyond comprehension,  is that the things that I don't like about it could have been avoided.  These are not technical glitches.  This is a well-made, brilliant piece of technology.  The calendar is great.  Everything about it is great.  But what do they do?  They go with AT&T because they're going to get a piece of the phone calls 
[02:12:30]  and they can bully AT&T.  Because AT&T is basically a bunch of faggots.  And they know what their job is to get on their hands and knees, open their assholes,  and say, anyone from Cupertino, come on in.  No condoms required.  But the web service on this, to say it sucks a dick,  would be to do a disservice to Larry Craig and all other men who love a cock buried in their gun.  Well, we don't know about Larry Craig. 
[02:13:00]  Okay, just a guess, considering he was arrested for it.  I got things to pay for.  I don't know that that's true about Larry Craig at this time, sir.  I say it in humor.  All right.  I will note that the...  Do you like the web browser they're in?  The browser?  It could be faster.  Hell yeah.  Way to put it.  Mailing a letter and stapling your thoughts to a turtle's back and saying,  go!  Bring it to who I need.  But my email, I'm just using the mail icon.  I hit it, and here's my email. 
[02:13:30]  I don't do that.  Why?  That's what it's set up for.  I'll tell you.  You're taking a Ferrari and using it to drive the kids to school.  No, I'm not.  I'm taking a Ferrari, and I just want to go on a different road.  And for some reason, the only fucking road the Ferrari goes fast on is the one road especially  built in Cupertino, whereas the rest of the fucking internet is not based on that road.  So it's like...  And me and Sam knows more about this stuff than I do. 
[02:14:00]  And I think...  What's it called?  The one...  What did they go with?  EV.  EV.  Whatever the fuck that means.  EV.  Eventually, your shit will come.  Sam, can you explain to me?  And Sam raised it, because I didn't know why they did it.  Can I jump on really fast?  Sure.  Ecstasy of the gold, performed by The Motley Crue.  The Motley Crue.  Ecstasy of gold?  Ecstasy of gold.  I don't even know, to be honest.  It is ecstasy of gold.  But just funny how you said the gold.  Ecstasy of the gold. 
[02:14:30]  I'm going to say it again.  Because he kind of just paused.  Of the gold.  The gold.  Sam.  Yes, Sam.  Hold on.  You on?  Technological whiz kid.  Is that what you are now?  No.  No, I was just saying that they went with, I think, the Edge network instead of the G3 network.  And my only assumption would be that because they want to be able to put out the next iPhone  and say it's four times faster.  Get those stock prices up with the new phone and the new announcement and the more gigs 
[02:15:00]  which you could have put on the first phone.  But meanwhile, first generation iPhone buyers, just open your mouth wider and take the fucking  load.  We're going to fire down your throat.  And I'm a dummy.  I never go with first generation shit, but I did.  Can I be honest with you, Jimmy?  Yes, baby girl.  The reason that anybody right now is carrying around an iPhone, it's a status symbol.  I'll be honest with you.  You wanted to be one of the first ones to have it?  You got it.  Here's what I gave up for an iPhone. 
[02:15:30]  Yeah, service.  I gave up.  Quality.  Speed.  Listening to your party when they call you.  I'll tell you what you gained.  What?  Hello.  What?  Hello.  It's me.  I'm echoing.  It's me.  Caulfield.  Caulfield.  Caulfield.  Caulfield.  Hi, Caulfield.  I gave up television.  I had television on my other phone.  I was able to watch Fox News and everything like that.  I gave up video recording. 
[02:16:00]  I had a video recorder.  I was able to do that.  I gave up the ability to text people for photographs, which I did a lot of.  It was a lot of fun to do things like that.  Um, and yeah, uh, speed.  Uh, why?  To have an iPhone.  I wanted to see what it was all about.  I wanted to, uh, to see.  And I knew that the second generation one's going to be better, as will the third.  It's just like the original iPod.  The original iPod, if you look at it now, it sucks ass. 
[02:16:30]  It was a bit clunky.  A bit clunky.  Exactly.  Oh, clunky.  Clunky.  And, uh, now they're going to be coming out with a new one that's going to be amazing.  Uh, but the next generation iPhone, and it is exactly that.  They don't want to put out a product that is going to make people go, well, I'll have this  for about 10 years.  And then they go, okay, we'll just shut our doors.  Goodbye.  We're out of business.  So they fuck you with the first one.  And then they slowly build it better and better.  Remember when the megahertz and computers used to like come out every few months, you'd get 
[02:17:00]  the 333 processor, the 666, and then the, the, uh, oh my God, we're up to like a gig.  It was amazing.  And every fucking six months you were left in the dirt.  I, that's what they're doing.  I know.  I understand that.  But this is also the same company that had everything first.  They're the originators.  Yeah.  And yet windows is an 80% of the world's computers or something like that.  And I think because they didn't fucking want to license the software, they want it to be 
[02:17:30]  motherfuckers.  And this is what you get.  And it's a great company.  I'm not shitting.  Not even because they sponsor the CBS site.  I, for real, I love my fucking Mac.  Yeah.  I love it.  But this enrages me because I know what they could have done with it.  And I know exactly why they did it.  And I'm, I don't care about the status symbol.  It actually, I was so dumb.  It looked like a good product to me.  It looked like you can sync it with your fucking Mac.  Everything's going to move quickly. 
[02:18:00]  You're on the internet fast.  Because fucking stupid, fucking Mr. Freeze, cunt face, Bob Kelly.  That fucking pile of shit was rated, dad, dad, you go on, you open, he's showing me with  his little fucking rotten dick-beating fingers how you go zap.  You pinch.  You pinch the pictures open and close and they get bigger and smaller.  You put those fucking lonely fingers on the screen.  And you go, fuck, and it opens, fuck, it opens up the webpages. 
[02:18:30]  But what fucko didn't tell me is that Wi-Fi, you can't just sign on to networks unless you  have a password.  Nobody has a password for every fucking cocksucking network.  So if you're home or if you're at the comedy cellar like we always are and have free Wi-Fi,  boom, it's very fast.  Yeah.  But everywhere else in the world, it's fucking shit.  Well, isn't that like any computer?  If you're at an airport, you're going to get free Wi-Fi.  If you're somewhere at some fucking upper crusty cafe that is going to want you to pay or 
[02:19:00]  a hotel or something like that, you got to pay for it.  But the Wi-Fi works fine when you're in a free Wi-Fi.  But they could have went with a faster one where it wouldn't have been such a disparity.  Why is Sam awkwardly holding the mic still?  I don't know.  I don't know.  He's adorable.  And he knows how to keep a secret.  I learned something today.  And Dan is not happy about that.  Oh.  Am I wrong, Sam?  No, no, no.  You're not right.  Thank you. 
[02:19:30]  What did you have before that was faster?  Blackberry.  My fucking Verizon.  That fucking douchebag they have.  Can you hear me now?  I'd love him to be embroiled in some sort of a fucking internet child porn stand.  I can't tell you my disdain for that fucking guy.  He might be a bit harsh.  I mean, that's as nice as I can be.  That's as nice as I can be.  That's as nice as I can be.  As I see his fucking dumb nerd face everywhere I go.  But you know what? 
[02:20:00]  Verizon service is fucking great.  I don't know.  I'm one of these silly geese that thinks I should be able to make phone calls in Manhattan.  Wherever you are.  It's just a little suburb called Manhattan that I fucking live in.  Caulfield, Caulfield, Caulfield.  Did it.  I got three phones in my new place and I got to get a landline.  Oh, are you having problems still?  And I never wanted a landline since the cell phone thing happened.  I can't believe that.  Well, we're on the left side.  I got three different phones.  I got a business phone, a personal phone, and then Lindsay's got her phone. 
[02:20:30]  None of the phones work well in the freaking apartment.  Yeah, I had the same problem.  So now I got to get a landline on top of all this.  That's odd.  It's what we are.  It's New York City, for fuck's sake.  I don't know what that's all about, but I'm sorry about that, Jimmy.  It's okay.  I feel nauseous.  And it was all during ecstasy of the gold.  Ecstasy of the gold.  Can I have someone to go get me some pretzel nuggets?  You all right?  Yeah, I feel like I'm going to puke.  What happened, Jimmy?  He's just so aggravated.  Yeah.  I'm so annoyed right now.  But I'm also, I think I drank too much coffee and didn't eat enough.  But I feel like I'm going to vomit, so. 
[02:21:00]  All right.  You could vomit while we're on the radio.  It might be the rage.  It could be.  Yeah, when you get worked up.  It's not even the rage, dude.  Yeah, but when ecstasy of gold starts and I'm fucking, I'm trying to get my email real  quick.  And then all of a sudden we're 40 minutes into the show and I still see that fucking  faggoty ball circle going nowhere.  I'm like, you know what?  You could have made this better.  You could have made it better, dude.  That's what bothers me.  If it was on Wi-Fi, I know they could have made it better.  And I just think of his stupid fucking balding face and his dumb, get the fucking LASIK 
[02:21:30]  surgery, motherfucker.  I'm the CEO of Apple.  The fucking dumb glasses.  That said, my PC is shit.  I hated it.  And I love the Apple computer.  I love my Mac.  Love it.  I'm getting a Mac desktop.  Not for free, obviously, after these tirades.  I have one.  I was trying to.  I have one.  Love it.  My G5, I'm trying to hook it up to my network last night and I just want to bang my fucking 
[02:22:00]  head against the wall.  I have the worst problem with networking my computers.  And it's because I don't remember what I did the time before because I went through 10 hours  of bullshit that time.  So I get on, I do everything I'm supposed to do with the router and set everything up.  I plug in the fucking Ethernet cable.  I'm ready to go.  No internet connection.  What the fuck?  But you figured it out once before. 
[02:22:30]  Oh, once.  Like eight times.  And each time, there were a thousand steps of trial and error.  So I don't know.  It's always a fucking problem with a network.  Always.  So now I'll go home later before the gym.  And fuck around with that and try to get that working.  Computers are just, they can be, everything can be so much easier.  But you know what's great about Apple?  And this is what I love about this thing.  I wanted to print something the other day.  All I got to do is plug in the printer and it does it. 
[02:23:00]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Plug in the windows and the faggoty drivers and fuck you.  Downloading all kinds of shit.  And the new hardware wizard.  Did it really find new hardware?  Good.  Because I plugged it in.  We all knew it was there.  It wasn't a secret.  Wizard.  Wizard.  The fuck, but no.  The new hardware wizard.  Guess what I found?  I don't know.  Jerk off.  The thing I plugged in with the USB.  You fucking cunt. 
[02:23:30]  We have located the hardware.  Yeah, I bought it.  I put it next to the computer.  Why are you bragging that you found it?  I just plugged it in.  With your wizardry.  The wizardry.  There's some wizardry.  I used all of my wizardry and I located the thing you plugged in.  My fucking Mac doesn't brag.  I plug it in.  It's understood that it's going to locate shit because it's a fucking computer and that's what it does.  That is so funny.  It's like, Windows has located a new piece of hardware. 
[02:24:00]  How amazing.  Maybe I should brag.  And the human plugged the fucking thing in.  I bought it, fucko.  Exactly.  And I didn't put my foot through your screen, which I easily could have and should have done.  You needy piece of shit.  What's the exclamation point in the yellow box?  Conflict.  Port number 3207 is in use.  Try fucking find.  What?  Why can't they just have ports A, B, C, and D? 
[02:24:30]  That's what all USB should be.  A, B, C, and D.  Color coded.  What?  You know what?  You're right.  Something.  I can't open.  I have AOL.  I know it's archaic, but I've been using it for years.  I use a regular Explorer.  It's training wheels.  I know, but I still like it.  But I don't use it for everything, just basically email.  It's adorable.  My AOL will just not open on my Mac.  For some reason, AOL for Mac, it works in other places, but it's something to do with my internet connection. 
[02:25:00]  My girlfriend and I cannot video conference.  Video conferencing on Mac is great.  Like, when you're away, you just boot it up and you fucking video conference with your friend.  Yeah, the iChat thing.  You're jerking off within minutes.  You're jerking.  You're jerking.  It's exactly what it is and what you do.  The wizard found an erection.  Well, I don't like the...  Yes.  You just put your dick in your...  I've detected cum on my monitor.  Does your computer locate your jerking?  What I don't like about it is that the fucking...  I have to get an external camera because the camera's built in. 
[02:25:30]  Yes.  To the top.  So you gotta tilt the...  Now I have to type while the fucking camera's aimed at my cock.  So you can see my fucking little chubby legs splayed out on the bed and my hands typing.  Hey, I'm fucking my...  I'm one over on the keyboard, so I'm not typing right.  I'd love to asterisk 35QU.  What?  What?  Excuse me.  Keith from Long Island.  He writes, Apple went with Edge 2.5G instead of the UMTS slash HSDPA 3G because 3G requires 
[02:26:00]  a lot more power and would drain the battery much quicker.  And Apple wanted to proclaim a long battery life.  The battery would die 30% quicker if it was a 3G.  Well, then how about this?  This guy lives in his mother's basement.  Thank God for that guy.  And how about this, Apple?  Instead of worrying about the battery life and the stock price you can fucking brag,  how about you make a fucking attachment for it that gives longer battery life?  Or how about you make the battery fucking replaceable so I can fucking charge one while 
[02:26:30]  one is in use like I could with all my other fucking phones so you have a battery that you  can take off.  If why do I, if the, why does the battery, where was I in these jeans?  Everything's enclosed.  Oh, cow.  Perfect.  They don't want you poking around in there.  Oh, the only people I can touch, take it to the genius bar.  Oh, man.  The genius bar.  The genius bar.  What time's your next class to the genius bar? 
[02:27:00]  I'm having problems.  The genius bar.  The genius bar.  They got the genius bar.  They sure do.  You have a problem, you go down there, and there's people qualified to take care of your  needs.  And they are.  By far, their customer service blows away those shit dicks that I had to deal with  Adele.  I'm sorry, but they fucking...  Time to start writing.  What about the spy sweeper?  Spy sweeper.  What do you think of the spy sweeper on your computer?  I don't know what this... 
[02:27:30]  Oh, that's one thing I love about Windows.  Because whenever I boot it up, fucking laughing.  That fucking jerk-off antivirus thing.  Just start scanning.  And I keep telling it, stop scanning.  Stop it already.  You motherfucker.  It was off.  It didn't pick up any viruses when it was off.  Every time you turn that fucker on, it comes on, would you like to download this?  Would you like to scan?  And I go, no.  And then it goes, the next time you boot it up, or you look at it, boom, there it is 
[02:28:00]  again.  So I go, all right, I'll tell you when.  Would you like to remind...  Would you like...  You can remind me when to fucking...  Whatever.  So I click it, and I go, two days.  That's the longest they let you go.  And then it comes back.  Hello.  McAfee.  McAfee would like to remind you.  I remember.  Do you take advantage of reporting errors?  No.  Oh, my God.  That one.  Would you like to report?  I like that.  You know, you get the crash, you control-alt-delete, and then you'll... 
[02:28:30]  Would you like to report this?  Yeah.  Who the fuck is reading eight gazillion reports that have to be pouring in?  Right.  Anthony from Long Island.  Yeah, oh, let me look at this one.  Wow, this has got to be an important error message.  Well, this is serious.  He was looking at the New York Radio message board, and his Explorer crashed for a second.  Well, I'll get someone right out.  Does Norton do the same thing, or is it just McAfee?  Norton antivirus.  I don't think I had the problems with Norton.  I think McAfee is just... 
[02:29:00]  Do you know who McAfee is?  It's a fucking nudge.  McAfee is a nudge.  A nudge.  I'm going to scan...  I'd rather you didn't.  It's literally...  But you did say two days ago that I could scan it today.  I know that.  I didn't mean it.  I was just trying to shut you up.  But you did kind of promise today.  It's not a nudge.  A nudge.  It's a shoulder-tapping program.  Excuse me.  We'd like to put...  I'm protected.  I'm fine.  But what about your...  What about your firewall?  It's fine.  Thank you.  Did you have the atheism? 
[02:29:30]  Yes.  Yeah.  Leave me alone.  I hate that.  Like a Jewish mother.  I just forgot to tell you...  All right.  There are new viruses that you may not have downloaded the cures for.  Did you know that we've been doing some...  We know.  I'm okay.  You should put on a coat.  It's cold outside.  Try...  I'm not on Kazaa downloading horse dick-sucking videos.  .exe.  I understand. 
[02:30:00]  What about pop-up blockers?  You're a big fan of the pop-up blockers?  Oh, they never get old.  I need one program.  Hey, how about AOL?  Stop with the fucking spy this and the spy that.  I have antivirus for that.  Yeah.  I'm going to get rid of McAfee.  McAfee, you know what it is?  It can fucking eat my asshole.  That's my official McAfee line.  You should send that report in.  Eat my asshole.  Eat my asshole.  I'm going with Norton.  Yeah.  Can we play the Matt Besser phone call now?  The tech support call? 
[02:30:30]  Yeah.  Oh, please.  Remember the Jimmy Stewart guy?  That guy rules.  This guy rules.  Keep your chin up.  Imitating Jimmy Stewart.  He's like the tech support.  Some lady had a problem.  Yeah.  Oh, and the AOL cancellation.  Yeah, we haven't played that in a while.  Yeah.  Yeah, we got some fun.  Oh, that's always fun.  Which one do you want to do?  The Jimmy Stewart?  Well, I went through that AOL cancellation thing myself because I had noticed that I had  been paying for AOL, two AOL accounts.  And I think this is how AOL makes their money. 
[02:31:00]  I've been paying for two AOL accounts for 10 years.  Right.  I've stopped using AOL probably eight years.  So for eight years, I was paying for two accounts that I never even ever used.  Did you try to cancel them?  Yeah.  Finally, I would just, because it was on my Amex.  And I was just like, I just would let it go.  I wouldn't even look.  Or I'd be like, you know, maybe I'll use it. 
[02:31:30]  I just never thought about it.  And so I called him up and I said, I want to cancel these two.  Why?  Because I never use it.  Never use it.  Well, you're coming around to a billing cycle that really, you get another month here.  So if you want to cancel after that month, you could call back.  No, no, no.  No.  Cancel?  Cancel it right now.  Now.  Can we give you three months free?  And I was like, no, I want this canceled right now. 
[02:32:00]  Dude, they wouldn't cancel it.  To the point where I got off the phone after about an hour with total confidence that the  accounts were canceled.  And then the next bill that showed up, it was billed again.  I still had AOL.  They're amazing at how they will not cancel your fucking account.  You got to get the name of these, and I call them shit heaps, for lack of a better term.  But they really are.  Just picture it. 
[02:32:30]  Not even pieces of shit, because a piece is nice and tapered and kind of looks better than  you think it will on your chest.  But a shit heap is like a vegan shit.  It's all fucking feta cheese.  I don't know if vegans even eat cheese.  Whatever.  Fuck vegans.  It's like they're shit heaps.  Get their name immediately.  Hi.  And who am I speaking to?  They'll be happy to give it to you.  Oh.  And then once you got the name, record the conversation, too.  I got to figure out how to hook up this phone thing, so I can record conversations.  Yeah.  Because then you just blast them on the air.  Yeah. 
[02:33:00]  We could play the Jimmy Stewart tech call.  Yeah.  Want to play that?  And then the AOL cancellation.  You're saying that we played it during our vacation.  But come on, man.  Ah, shit.  I didn't hear it.  I didn't hear it.  And our names are on the marquee.  I mean, I haven't heard that bit in a long time.  All right.  We'll start with the Jimmy Stewart tech call.  Yeah.  This is Matt Besser.  He's a very funny guy.  He used to be part of Upright Citizens Brigade.  Is that who that is? 
[02:33:30]  Yeah.  Was he really a tech guy?  No.  What happened was he was just a dude hanging out in his apartment.  His number was very close to tech support, so he just said, you know what?  Fuck it.  I'm going to have some phone.  I started recording him.  I started recording this shit.  Oh, God.  That's fucking great.  UCB is a great little place.  You have a great little place somewhere.  Is it 28th Street, New York?  I don't know.  Fucking great shows there, man.  Yeah.  Well, here's Matt Besser.  Hi, support.  Hi.  I'm trying to get on the Barnes & Noble line, and I can't...  Oh, what's your problem? 
[02:34:00]  The problem is that every time I try to dial it, it comes up that they can't get through  and to call tech support.  We've got to be more specific, but we're going to get through this.  We're going to turn this thing around.  Great.  Do you use your toolbar?  Yeah.  I guess.  What's the toolbar?  Well, you've got to use your toolbar.  That's where your icons are that we're going to have to use to fix this problem.  But we're going to get through this later.  You've just got to keep your chin up. 
[02:34:30]  Okay.  I hope so.  Do you have a Mac or all the PCs?  I have a PC.  I have a desk.  Oh, that's good.  It's fine.  It's fine.  I also have...  I have the disc.  You know, I have the...  The...  The...  The Barnes & Noble disc.  Oh, you got the disc?  Yeah.  And it's...  Oh, the disc.  Well, that's great.  That's great.  It's not working.  The sun's on the horizon.  We're going to turn this thing around.  Great.  Okay.  Put your disc in.  It's in? 
[02:35:00]  Okay.  I'll boot up your computer.  You have to restart your computer.  Um, okay.  I got to go to shut down.  That's where your toolbar is.  You got to grab all of it.  Okay.  Shut down.  Restart.  I'll grab all of your toolbar.  Okay.  I have that.  Now, do you want me to go to restart?  Okay.  You got to stay focused now.  Don't get all upset.  No, I'm not.  All right.  Now, you got to turn it off, but then you're going to see the restart.  Hey, you check restart.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Okay. 
[02:35:30]  You want me to press...  Okay.  I understand what you're saying.  You want me to say press shut down or restart?  Restart.  Okay.  You got to stay focused.  You don't lose your cool.  Okay.  You're making me confused, though.  So I'm...  No.  Well, take a breath.  I'm taking a breath.  All right.  Just calm down.  Take a breath.  So I just...  I press restart.  Yeah.  Well, calm down now.  You can't yell at me here.  I'm not...  No, I'm not yelling at you.  Okay.  I'm not yelling at you.  It's just...  You know, it's frustrating. 
[02:36:00]  What's happening?  www.del.com came up on my screen.  So it'll be a minute or two now.  Okay.  Making all noises and what have you.  But I left the CD in there.  Is that good or should I take it out?  It'll stay in the room, right?  Yep.  Let's stick a music CD in there.  No, it's not music CD.  Oh, I'm not joking.  No, I...  It'll break your computer.  Oh, no.  It's like throwing vinegar on a horse's ass. 
[02:36:30]  Really?  Well, that's a new expression on me.  I hadn't heard that one.  Excuse me?  I haven't heard that, throwing vinegar on a horse's ass before.  Oh, I'm trying.  You're going to get kicked in your head.  I guess so.  No, I don't spend much time around horses, so it wouldn't be something I know.  Oh, yeah.  If you don't spend much time around horses, you don't make a jackass out of your own self.  Oh, well, that could be.  Where are you located now?  Uh, Houston.  Oh, Houston?  Okay, well. 
[02:37:00]  Well, what?  Well, that's...  Where are you from?  New York City.  Oh, that's right.  The 212.  Right.  So, you know, we don't have a lot of horses around.  Yeah, but you got a lot of jackasses up there.  Well, that's for sure.  That's for sure.  We're looking at 10 inches of snow on Saturday.  Well, I say you don't look at the 10 inches.  You step out in there, you get out there, you work, you shove off that snow and turn things around.  You're right.  Okay, now, it came up here. 
[02:37:30]  Yahoo Messenger cannot connect.  Yahoo!  Hee-haw!  At the end of the call?  Yeah, there's no real good ending.  Yeah, but...  But it's still really funny, man.  It's the trip.  It's the trip on that one.  Yeah.  Great.  People are suggesting that Rocco should be tech support.  Dude!  Dude!  Turn on your computer, dude!  We should try to get...  Maybe Matt Besser has some more calls that he has.  I think he does.  Yeah, he probably does. 
[02:38:00]  I'm sure if he had the number that was close there.  That is damn funny.  And Brian...  You gotta grab your tool bar.  Tool bar.  Tool bar.  Brian from St. Louis.  Guys, I gotta tell you, I love angry, not in love, Jimmy.  So much better than pussy whipped, comes these kisses, Jimmy.  Comes these kisses.  He's killing.  Jimmy, when I'm in a relationship, I mean, I'm not gonna be who I'm not.  I'm happy sometimes, sometimes I'm not.  Of course.  I will miss, if we break up, I will miss attention-seeking drill.  That made me happy. 
[02:38:30]  Yeah?  Yeah.  She was so annoying, because she literally would come next to my cheek and go...  And make a drill noise until I gave her attention and kissed her.  Attention-seeking drill.  She would just go, look, attention-seeking drill.  I'm like, enough.  Thank you.  You think you'll work it out?  And you wonder why you snapped.  You think you'll work it out, Jimmy?  I don't know.  I mean, uh...  We hope so.  Me too.  It's those stupid things that the girls do that get you. 
[02:39:00]  She makes me laugh.  See?  Stupid things like that, they'll get you.  That and the way she drinks my cum.  I mean, those are...  Oh, my God.  I'm just saying.  It's a whole package.  I understand you're just saying.  All right.  It's not just attention-seeking drill.  All right, I got it.  I got it.  Occasionally, she'll do the attention-seeking drill in my ball bag.  How do you know?  Ah!  Plenty of attention-focused.  Scotch 88 is saying the attention should be a backhand if she's doing that.  But no, it makes me laugh.  I mean, you know, it's very rare you date a girl who really makes you laugh. 
[02:39:30]  Yeah.  And she really makes me laugh.  Not in a polite, all right, let me laugh, because my chick said,  something like that.  So you were laughing at the corner of the 20th and...  Oh, yeah.  As I visualized a Jake LaMotta moment, he's like, this fucking cock was bigger than yours.  As I visualized that, I smiled.  E-Rock's suggesting attention-seeking drill, though, today.  Probably our most overplayed bit since we're going to XM.  Hey, Matt Besser, he's got that CD out. 
[02:40:00]  Yeah, may I help you, dumbass?  There's more calls on there.  And there might be some stuff on his website, mattbesser.com.  Tell him Opie Anthony sent you.  Let's pilfer some stuff.  Well, why not?  They're funny.  For us.  Hey, you want to do AOL cancellation going into break?  Yeah.  So the people that already heard while we were on vacation, they could, like, step away for a while?  Yeah, I got to take a piss anyway, so people that have heard it, do the same.  Yeah, all right.  Here's AOL cancellation.  This guy just loses his mind.  It's Opie Anthony with Adam Farrar, who's on Rescue Me tonight at 10 on FX. 
[02:40:30]  Hi, this is John at AOL.  How may I help you today?  I wanted to cancel my account.  Sorry to hear that.  But pull your account up here real quick.  Can I have your name, please?  Vincent.  Hey, Vincent.  I'm with privacy and security.  Can I have the last four digits of your payment method, please?  All right.  Thank you very much.  Okay.  You've had this account for a long time?  Yep.  It's just quite a bit.  What was causing me to turn this off today? 
[02:41:00]  I don't use it anymore.  Do you have a high-speed connection, like a DSLR cable?  Yep.  Okay.  How long have you had that?  No.  The high-speed.  Years.  Okay.  Well, actually, I'm showing a lot of usage on this account.  Yeah, a long time ago.  Not recently.  Well, the Poff's account was on 71 hours since the 24th of last month.  No, he wasn't.  He doesn't even have the AOL software installed on his computer.  You're looking at AIM usage, probably.  No, AIM usage doesn't come on to this. 
[02:41:30]  He doesn't have the AOL software installed on his computer.  Oh, this is your father then?  Yep.  Okay.  Well, I'm looking at this account.  Either way.  Okay.  Whatever you're saying.  Well, what's causing him to turn this off today?  I mean, obviously, I mean...  I don't use it, and he doesn't use it, so we're canceling.  Okay.  I'm telling you, he doesn't use the account.  The software is not even on his computer.  No.  Well, okay.  I mean, is there a problem with the software itself?  No, I just, I don't use it.  I don't need it.  I don't want it.  I just don't need it anymore. 
[02:42:00]  Okay.  So when you use this, I mean, you use the computer, I'm saying.  Is that for business or for school?  Dude, what difference does it make?  I don't want the AOL account anymore.  Can we please cancel it?  Well, on June 2nd, this account was signed on.  It's been on for 72 hours.  On June 2nd?  I don't know how to make it any clearer.  Last year was 540, last month was 545 hours of usage.  I don't know how to make this any clearer, so I'm just going to say it one last time.  Cancel the account, please. 
[02:42:30]  Well, explain to me what's...  I'm not explaining anything to you.  Cancel the account.  Well, what's the matter, Rance?  I mean, we're just, I'm just trying to help here.  You're not helping me.  You're helping me would be canceling.  I am trying to help.  Okay.  Helping me, listen, I called to cancel the account.  Helping me would be canceling the account.  Please help me and cancel my account.  No, I wouldn't, actually.  Cancel my account.  Or knock your account.  Cancel the account.  Cancel the account.  Is your dad there?  My dad?  I'm the primary person on the account.  Not my dad.  Cancel the account. 
[02:43:00]  Yeah, because I'm just trying to figure out...  Cancel the account.  I don't know how to make this any clearer for you.  Cancel the account.  The card is mine in my name.  The account is mine and in my name.  When I say cancel the account, I don't mean help me figure out how to keep it.  I mean cancel the account.  Well, I'm sorry.  I don't know what anybody's done to you, Vincent, but this is...  You're annoying the shit out of me.  That's what you're doing to me.  Cancel the account, please.  Okay.  Now, that goes both ways, my friend.  Good.  Can you please cancel the account?  All right. 
[02:43:30]  Someday, when you calm down, you're going to realize all I was trying to do was help you,  and it was actually in your best interest to listen.  Wonderful.  Not when that epiphany happens, then just give us a call back.  Wait.  As a process or cancellation request, let's say about a free benefit available for valued  members like yourself.

If you want me to cancel this account, you're going to let me speak and give this paragraph.  Okay?  Because if not, we can start you all day. 
[02:44:00]  I really don't care, to be honest with you.  But you're going to listen to me, if you want this or not.  So, can I speak now?  Go right ahead.  Thank you.  Appreciate that.

Hey, this is Jim Norton.  Listen as one man describes an addiction.  Wherever there were cocks, there was me.  And how he went from one cock to many. 
[02:45:00]  I was taking a hundred a night.  What do you think of them apples?  Then, you'll hear a horrifying tale of a bukkake party gone wrong.  Blurka, blurka, blurka, blurka, blurka.  All over my fat, colorless stomach.  You can't tell where the cum ends and my skin begins.  Blurka, blurka, blurka.  Plus, an ending you won't want to miss.  That's right.  I say a couple of men do some docking and settle this.  It all happens on the next Opie and Anthony Show.  Adam Farrar in studio. 
[02:45:30]  I'm still upset over that AOL call.  What happened?  It enraged me.  Yeah.  That guy did get fired, though.  He did?  Yeah.  Supposedly, yeah.  I was ready to go Norton on him.  Oh, you don't want to do that.  I would love to, by the way, while we're on break, while Adam reminded me of something,  because I forgot.  I didn't realize it until I had, I was so naive, right? 
[02:46:00]  This is like an iPod as well as a phone.  It's everything.  So, I say to myself, you know what, Jimbo?  You got your iPod slash phone.  I have a few tunes on here.  I say, while I'm down at the comedy show the other night, let me pop in my old headphones,  which I brought along.  This way, I can go to, because they do have Wi-Fi there, so I can watch some YouTube, listen  to some music.  But what I didn't realize is that when they sell you the iPhone, they don't tell you  that if you want to use... 
[02:46:30]  See, I can't use the headphones they give you with these things, because I have fucking  fetus ears, so I can only use special headphones.  I can't use those.  They hurt my head.  The earbuds.  You can't use the buds.  Cannot use them.  Aw.  They hurt me.  So, if you want to use any other headphones on the planet, why would they fit?  You got to buy an adapter.  Oh, because there's a little divot in there.  It's recessed.  Yeah, it's recessed.  One more way to dig a few more fucking dollars.  Sheckles.  Just, you know what? 
[02:47:00]  We didn't fuck you hard enough on this first generation.  How about a couple of more sheckles?  Well, you want to listen to your own headphones, do you?  Fuck you.  Pay me.  After I cum on you, I'm going to spit in your eye.  That is exactly what it is.  I know I said I'd tell you when I'm cumming, but I didn't, and you swallowed it.  Now here's some that's left over on my helmet.  Clean it up with your hair.  So, you can't fucking...  You got to buy a special adapter.  Of course, just another way to stick their dick down your throat. 
[02:47:30]  And I love the fact that everybody thinks Apple is this fucking amazingly hip company.  They are as savage and as business-oriented as any company ever has been.  All right.  No hippie organization anymore.  Cuppertino!  We live in Cuppertino!  Shitty name for a town.  You know what I call it?  It should be called Fuckville.  Yeah, Fuckville.  Or Shit Heap Town.  Shit Heap.  Oh.  I was trying to calm Jimmy down. 
[02:48:00]  We haven't calmed him down in a while.  I got Jimmy's calming music, but...  Looks like he's calm now.  Yeah.  I feel all right.  All right, good.  I've been better.  My food pocket's acting up today.  No, stop with the food pocket.  Stop with the food pocket.  Last time I got my teeth cleaned, Adam, my dentist got me all paranoid.  He says I have a food pocket that I... 
[02:48:30]  What the hell is that?  What are you, marsupial?  That I got to keep clean.  And every once in a while, I'll feel my food pocket acting up.  Wait a minute.  So I got to chomp on some gum right now.  You got a place where food collects?  That's what a food pocket is.  Took all these years to find that one.  I went to the dentist.  Apparently, I have occlusions.  Ooh.  They're not good and they're very expensive to fix.  What are occlusions?  They're like...  When you have a...  It's like a little concave thing in your fillings.  Yeah.  And you got to get them fixed.  Why?  Why?  Because they need money.  My dentist is Apple. 
[02:49:00]  I said, I don't feel any pain.  And they always...  It's like the Dianetics test.  You know when you take the stress test?  If you've ever done those...  You see people giving you this free stress test?  You're like...  I take the test and they go, thank God you're here.  You could snap at any minute.  Whenever I go to the dentist, it's like, you could die tomorrow.  You have to have this thing.  Because of your teeth?  Yeah.  You took that Dianetics test?  Yeah, I did.  Why?  I was under tremendous stress.  Don't you understand that you hold on to two little handles or something and it's just 
[02:49:30]  all bullshit?  I know.  I realized it.  How about your thetans?  My thetans?  I had a lot of engrams.  Did you?  Yeah, they told me.  I said, what's an engram?  They go, well, it's something that's blocking you from getting to your ultimate goal.  And I looked at the guy and went, you're a fucking engram.  Get out of my way.  I'm getting on the subway.  How do they say to cure that?  Like, you have to hop on one leg and blow John Travolta?  Like, what's the cure for this one?  You have to run around Scientology and deny the same way we do.  Happily married, are you? 
[02:50:00]  Yeah.  Put on the boat clothing.  Fucking haven that place is.  We all know what you're a haven for.  Everyone knows it.  I never heard that one.  What?  Well, it's a haven for it.  I just assumed a lot of the celebrities that were drawn in there might be.  My thought was that it was a haven for certain people.  It's a very close-knit community.  Fiercely protective.  A very, very powerful team. 
[02:50:30]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  And I understand that.  I'm guessing that it's just that I think it's a safe place for certain people to be themselves.  Like, when they have to be photographed one way, in one place, but in this place...  Oh, so they can, like, whoop it up.  Mm-hmm.  I don't know.  Have a lot of fun.  Let your freak flag fly.  I'm just feeling that's what it is.  I've always thought that.  No one has told me that.  That's what I think.  Oh.  Wow.  Well, didn't Elrond dress like Paul Lynn with the sailor hats and... 
[02:51:00]  I don't know anything about Elrond Hubbard.  No.  This is, like, half-assed science fiction writer or some crap like that.  Bad science fiction writer.  And then, uh...  I believe in an author.  Took some of it.  Who?  That's the new religion, man.  A lot of people are into Elrond Hubbard.  I believe in Chuck Palahniuk.  As God or something?  Yeah, yeah.  You're a Palahniuk?  My fight club is my Bible.  That's Elrond Hubbard?  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Oh, God.  Oh, boy.  Wow.  Remember the Montclair cigarette ads?  Oh. 
[02:51:30]  Elrond Hubbard looks...  An ascot?  He's got an ascot.  Oh, boy.  And look at that faraway look he's got.  Oh, boy.  Mm.  You have evil in you.  It must be taken out.  Yes.  You know, he looks like Zha Zha's husband who said he fathered Anna Nicole's baby.  Oh.  What?  Do you mean this?  Baron Von Dickhead, whatever his name is.  Wait, who is he?  I don't remember him.  I was a naughty boy.  Yeah. 
[02:52:00]  Elrond looks like fucking Rodney.  I tell you got Thetans.  The spaceship's coming.  You want to get on it?  All right.  We're going to do some things.  My wife said I want to go someplace I've never been.  I said, how's your red grams?  I wish I did better impersonations.  It still works to me.  You're not in the mannerism and everything.  You're pulling out your...  Oh, my wife's a bad cook.  Oh, my wife's a bad cook.  Take that plane out of your backyard and quit sucking dicks. 
[02:52:30]  Oh.  There he is.  Wow.  There he is with the boat hat.  Oh, boy.  Oof.  Oh, boy.  What is he?  He looks like Alan Hale.  That's exactly what he looks like.  Oh, boy.  I want to go over there.  That's what he looks like.  Hey, Swanson.  I want to go over there.  These engrams are keeping me from going over there.  Got that cellar out.  You scratch my feet.  Or whatever. 
[02:53:00]  That captain's hat.  He's the skipper.  He's the skipper.  The skipper.  Can we get off this island?  Why would you want to?  People accept us here.  Ah-ha.  I'm here, little buddy.  Yeah, that's the head muckety-muck of the whole thing, huh?  Yeah.  And they get people with millions upon millions of dollars to give generously.  Too bad they weren't computers back in his day, man.  Not to get a hold of his computer. 
[02:53:30]  I don't even say that they don't help people.  Like, they may have the answers to a lot of things that are common sense.  I don't know.  I mean, people seem to thrive.  I just don't, I don't know about that whole probe thing.  No.  I actually went, and I went to the headquarters in Hicksville.  Did you have to sign something that said you wouldn't tell anybody what the-  I forget.  What'd you do?  I went, and I looked-  So what happened?  I went, I looked around, and I looked around at the people, and you know what it reminded  me of?  Remember the Star Trek episode with the children? 
[02:54:00]  Come here to me.  Yeah, yeah.  Friendly angel.  And I got that friggin' android vibe, and I said, I gotta get the hell out of here.  You didn't stay for the whole thing?  Nah, I left.  Hot damn.  What are you thinking?  I don't know.  I also tried to sell you water purifiers.  What the hell was I saying?  That's true.  All right.  We got a bunch of mopping up to do.  Some good stuff, though.  Mopping up operation.  Talking about engagements today, right?  Well, yes.  Somebody lost their wedding ring.  Jonathan Henderson's All Smiles Now, but it was a different story after he dropped his 
[02:54:30]  wedding ring into this toilet because you know what was about to hit the fan when he  told his wife.  The butterflies are like, what is she going to say?  And right now she's pregnant, so every little thing kind of sets her off.  Can you believe it?  Jonathan took off his wedding ring to wash his hands in this port-a-potty, and the ring  fell into the toilet.  That's right.  The symbol of his undying love.  Why does he have to have the news voice?  Yeah.  Fell into the toilet.  His wedding ring fell in soupy shit. 
[02:55:00]  How great would it be if this guy was talking in that voice and somebody just gave him a  Colombian necktie.  Like, as he's talking, they gently lift his chin, slice his throat, and pull his tongue  out through his neck, and then make him finish as he's gurgling on his own blood.  It's just a thought.  That's right.  The symbol of his undying love for his wife lost in a soup of unspeakables.  So now what is poor Mr. Henderson to do?  His wedding ring is in the toilet.  Will his marriage follow?  And what in the world do you tell your wife? 
[02:55:30]  Now he's in church?  Here's what she said.  God, are you serious?  Thanks a lot.  You know what I mean?  That shows how much you care.  That's exactly what she said.  Exactly.  She really let me have it.  Did she?  Did she?  A really interesting story.  That's a feel-good story.  Dunk.  Thank goodness for the folks who maintained the port-a-potties because they were able  to help.  Customer service is our number one priority.  Tim Custard is the general manager of the company.  Custard?  Of course, he didn't actually retrieve the ring from the bowels of the outhouse. 
[02:56:00]  No, that chore went to Don Graham, who got the job done with a can.  Oh, shit, scooper.  How late do you have to be to work?  How late to work do you have to be where you see your name on that detail?  Yeah.  I pull through port-a-potty for lost items.  Someone drop their quarter.  Get to it.  That is a disgusting pile of contents in those port-a-potties.  Yeah.  Where was it?  I don't know.  A job site or something?  I don't know. 
[02:56:30]  Those are the worst.  That chore went to Don Graham, who got the job done with a can.  So you were scooping around in the soup with a can.  Correct.  And apparently on the first try, you found the ring.  Yes.  Congratulations.  Thank you.  With the ring back safely on his finger, Jonathan Henderson says he'll be more careful from  now on when he washes his hands.  We're just glad he doesn't wear dentures.  I get it.  Because if his teeth fell in there.  I'm a mouth full of shit.  I'm a mouth full of shit.  You know who's got to be pissed off is Don Graham. 
[02:57:00]  Thanks for telling everybody, asshole.  Yeah.  That's my fucking job.  I told people I work for NASA.  Yeah.  I scoop shit.  My mother thinks I'm a nurse.  I'd do the mail.  Can't do his voice.  Of course not.  I'd do the mail.  What?  Eddie, right?  Yeah.  Well.  Eddie.  Garbage.  Garbage.  Long time Met fan.  Who's Garbage?  Who loves to stare at tits when you take them out to lunch.  Jesus.  We all love that, Eddie, but you got to make it a little more discreet. 
[02:57:30]  Certain people.  Hmm?  Certain people on this planet.  Uh, don't really care if they're caught looking.  Yeah.  You know?  And I don't just mean guys that are like, you know, chauvinistic or something.  Misogynistic that they don't care.  There are certain people, maybe with certain issues.  People from certain towns like Dumbbellio.  Dumbbellio.  Same people that might look at a pinwheel a little. 
[02:58:00]  Right.  A little longer than most.  Moronistan.  You're just from a certain area.  They also consider gum and pennies healthy for the diet.  Yes.  Same thing.  Yeah.  By the way, this millionaire who's lost is probably dead.  Dead!  Yep.  So dead.  He's lost, what, three days now?  Steve Fox.  He did three days?  No.  Yeah.  Yesterday.  Steve Fox.  No, Monday, bro.  Oh, no.  Wow.  I think he took off Monday?  Why did I call you bro?  I'm sorry about that. 
[02:58:30]  Not filing a flight plan.  He's not wishing me luck.  Oh, yeah.  He's a dead man.  Him and Richard.  He's a, I mean, I'd like to hate him, but he really is a ballsy fuck.  First, first guy to go around the world, right?  Yeah.  And a balloon.  How bad that must have smelled from his farts and he gets into a cup.  You know why he did it?  His wife wouldn't shut the fuck up.  I'm leaving in a balloon.  That's it.  I'm blowing it up, bitch.  And then he went around the world nonstop.  Yeah.  I mean, in a plane.  All right.  And then he, he took off, probably some poor fuel management, I believe. 
[02:59:00]  And then he probably ran out of gas.  I heard he wasn't comfortable with the plane either.  He didn't really like that type of plane.  That plane is a piece of shit.  Wasn't it some kind of like acrobatic thing?  Like stunt plane type of thing?  It's a little piece of crap.  What is it?  It's not a worthy of a pilot of his stature, stature, magnitude, prowess. 
[02:59:30]  Oh, don't matter.  It's a big pile of fucking burning shit with his charred skeleton in the middle of it with  his jaw like this.  It's like any, any Indiana Jones skeleton right now.  Then again, roaches or snake.  I'm curious, rattlesnake, just checking things out.  All right.  Well, there was no, by the way, there was no radio calls made. 
[03:00:00]  So that's, which is kind of odd.  Like if you were in distress, wouldn't you call?  Maybe he had a heart attack or something in the air.  That's true too.  Maybe they pulled the, they pulled the radar tapes to see if he showed up on radar at all  to track them.  Cause there was no flight plan file.  So they pulled the tapes.  I'm thinking UFO.  Got him.  That would be ironic.  That would be really cool.  Seriously.  Roswell.  Nah, just the UFO.  Cool around Roswell.  Yeah.  Made him disappear.  There were weather balloons in Roswell.  They were, they were, they were, they were used, not weather, but they were used to  detect, detect nuclear devices.  There were no aliens at Roswell. 
[03:00:30]  And I want to believe, but here's to all you fucking cunt face ufologists out there.  There was no aliens at Roswell.  No.  None.  Why?  Because there weren't.  The alien autopsy is a hunk of shit.  What about, uh, area 51?  Ah, yeah.  Did they take the aliens to area 51?  Probably not.  Did they find the magic tinfoil?  Right.  The stuff that rolls up and then just unfolds.  Yeah.  That's fucking nonsense.  Break it.  Oh, fuck that Jesse Marsalis kid. 
[03:01:00]  The fuck does he remember?  Little douche.  Big deal.  It wasn't a UFO.  It was weird shit that they were testing Soviet nuclear testing and they could, they could  use to spot it.  That's all it was.  Yeah.  What bodies.  Didn't you see the, uh, video of, uh, uh, the UFO in Haiti?  That was a good one.  On YouTube?  That was a little, uh, that, uh, green screening that you guys.  Yeah.  That's like, you get into all CGI. 
[03:01:30]  Tell him you did it in the basement.  It's wonderful.  You know how you can tell Anthony did it?  It's out of focus.  It's out of focus.  Go fuck yourself.  You're out of focus.  All right.  Hey, uh, it's very creepy.  John McCain, uh, is in the news today.  What bathroom did he go in?  There's the Haiti UFO thing.  Yeah.  That guy did a good job on that.  Very good job.  All right.  Here's, uh, here's what John McCain's up to.  Um, if elected, you'd be older than Ronald Reagan, making you the oldest president. 
[03:02:00]  Do you ever worry that, like, you might die in the office again?  Or again, Alzheimer's is some other disease that might attack your judgment?  Well, you know, my kids, my children for many, many years have questioned my, my, uh, awareness.  Uh, I don't pay attention to some of the music that they like.  Uh, look, uh, when you saw my 95-year-old mother there, I think you saw the kind of genes that I have. 
[03:02:30]  I work 24-7.  I'm very active.  I enjoy life.  I am involved and engaged.  And people will judge, uh, will judge by the vigor and the enthusiasm associated with our campaign.  Every campaign I've ever been in my life, I've out-campaigned all of my opponents, and, uh, and I'm confident that I will.  And thanks for the question, you little jerk.  Good for him.  Love that.  Good for McCain. 
[03:03:00]  That's a good one.  A college student, probably?  Yeah, I was.  I think he was even younger than that, Jimmy.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Good for fucking John McCain.  He's a little jerk.  Good for him.  Old jerk.  He doesn't take any guff.  No, he's a fucking man's man.  Not anymore.  And John Edwards, meanwhile, fucking, and, uh, Colter called him a faggot, and he wouldn't comment.  Yeah.  You fucking Lego-haired twit.  Then we got, um, ABC, uh, news anchors laughing during the Owen Wilson, uh, suicide thing.  Morgan, what the hell are these guys doing? 
[03:03:30]  And Mesk, I just love telling, uh, awful news stories and laughing over them.  Well, they're probably just laughing at the fucking laughs they didn't get during You, Me,  and Dupree.  How fucking unfunny must that have been?  Yes, I will never see it.  I just saw the, the, the trailer for it when, when it came out in the movie, and I was like,  there's, I have no need to see this movie.  That's right.  It should have been called You, A Bag of H, and A Razor.  Hey, hey, hey, fuck you and your toothy smile, stupid. 
[03:04:00]  I don't like his toothy smile.  He puts his two front teeth together.  He's like, cheese.  You can picture him like, cheese.  I don't like Owen Wilson's fucking clickety-clap teeth smile.  Jimmy, if, uh, if you are going to get back together with your girlfriend, just, uh, take  your time.  That's all we ask around here.  Just take your time.  I'm, I'm, I'm, it's a callback to angry, Jimmy.  That's all.  I'm not even angry, though.  They love angry.  But it's not like I was with my girlfriend, and all of a sudden I'd come in and go, God 
[03:04:30]  speed, Owen.  I would have fucking, I would have laughed at him.  Good point, good point.  Wish him the best.  Wish him the best.  Hey, all the kids.  Thoughts and prayers.  All kid, all kid in his side.  We all go through tough times.  Thoughts and prayers.  Thoughts and prayers.  We, we're starting the skinny with a serious story, and we were laughing.  We'll explain why in a minute.  We'll fill you in, yeah.  First of all, this is, uh, tragic news here.  Owen Wilson, a lot of, uh, there we go already.  Anyway, poor Owen, says the graphic.  He apparently tried to kill himself, which is terribly serious, which is why you should 
[03:05:00]  not be laughing right now, Taina.  Um, he overdosed, or tried to, um, on pills and slit his wrist.  This is according to the New York Post, which, as you can see, they were nice enough to  put this on their front page here.  He's still in the hospital.  There he is.  Um, but anyway, he's in the hospital in Los Angeles asking for his privacy.  Terribly sad situation.  Yeah.  Uh, apparently he suffers from depression.  None of this is funny. 
[03:05:30]  I'm not laughing at this story.  We're just gonna move along here.  You're not gonna tell him why you're laughing?  Oh, it's so immature.  I think not.  I'll tell you.  Uh-oh.  Wilson has a uncle whose name is Ho.  H-O-E.  And that just struck us as funny during the break.  Sorry.  What, did it?  How come it didn't strike you as fucking funny when I missed it?  What?  You fucking vultures in the media.  How are you not funny?  You found that funny?  Yeah.  Ho Wilson?  Ho Wilson.  What's funny about that?  Nothing.  What is funny about that?  I'm trying to think.  Like, Ho Wilson. 
[03:06:00]  I can see if he had an uncle named fucking Clit Savage.  Fucking.  See?  A natural laugh there.  There you go.  His uncle's shit-tooth commented.  Aunt Bloodfart's in the news.  Yeah, there you go.  Ho Wilson.  Ho Wilson.  Ho Wilson.  Ho Wilson.  I know.  I'm trying to figure out if it says something.  Because it's Ho.  That's stupid.  All right.  They were laughing over the suicide and he suffers from depression. 
[03:06:30]  Hey, you gotta be fired for that as a news person.  I'm sorry.  Yeah, they're not going to.  What affiliate was that?  ABC.  Some ABC affiliate.  Not professional.  At this point, local news, no one takes them seriously anymore.  Nah, it's all.  This may be just a very small percentage of people that actually think that they are seeing  something serious.  Yeah, when something big happens, where do you go?  Come on.  You go to the big right.  Yeah.  The big news. 
[03:07:00]  Yeah.  You go to the two big friggin' news networks.  CNN and that shit heap.  If I may use Jimmy's term.  That shit heap Fox.  Yeah, Fox is going to sue us.  Really?  Yeah.  Because we use their sounder.  Oh.  Want Fox News fuck-ups on air?  What's that?  E-Rock.  The news reporter's cursing and slipping up when they do the reports.  I like the crawl on the Fox. 
[03:07:30]  It's so right-wing.  The crawl actually says, fuck them.  Fuck them all.  Fuck them, fuck them.  Die, die, die.  Oh, boy.  Now you're going to get sued.  You're probably going to get sued by Fox.  Yeah.  I wish they were to just let us do it.  Just let us play that stupid sound until they sue us.  Yeah, all right.  Uh, did we tell people we were going to play the Dell phone call?  Because they're yelling on instant feedback.  Or maybe it's just one person today.  I don't know.  It's one person.  It is one person?  Good.  Uh, guy can't.  All right, we'll go to break with the Dell phone call. 
[03:08:00]  This guy loses his mind.  We were talking about computers earlier.  It doesn't really make sense now, but what the hell.  What the heck?  What the heck?  Adam Farrar, Rescue Me tonight, 10 o'clock on FX.  You got a big part in tonight's episode?  I don't know which one tonight is.  Oh, it's the one before the final.  The one before the final.  I don't remember, but it's a good show.  Watch it.  All right, that means you weren't part of the filming of that one.  Great.  Adam, come on.  No, I think I was.  I forget which episode it was.  It's all a blur.  It was the one after you roughed up Dennis Larry.  Yeah.  Oh, my God. 
[03:08:30]  Filmed in order?  I don't know.  Yeah, we don't film.  You show up, say the lines.  Oh, my God.  No, I forgot that.  I don't know which one this episode is.  I'm unprepared.  I'll have a plug for the show.  Thanks, Adam.  It's a great episode.  Yeah.  It actually is.  I just don't know which one it was.  When your last two movies are You, Me, and Dupree and Blades of Glory, why wouldn't  you try to kill yourself?  Can I say what the beginning of the end for my girlfriend I was?  What, with hatred?  What?  What, Jimmy?  She wanted to rent Blades of Glory because she's friends with Amy Poehler. 
[03:09:00]  Mm-hmm.  And we watched it while we were on vacation in San Francisco.  Mm-hmm.  It's rare that I watch it.  Wait, in San Francisco?  Remember we went away to see our family?  Yeah, but I thought everything went well in San Francisco.  It did.  Except for this Blades of Glory thing.  Because I wanted to watch, I forget what I wanted to watch, but it was good.  Mm-hmm.  She wanted to watch, I wanted to watch Spider-Man 3.  Oh, okay.  She wanted to watch Blades of Glory.  Yeah.  And it's like, do you understand that figure skating is so ludicrous that to parody it 
[03:09:30]  and be ludicrous is stupid?  You see, if you're going to parody skating, it should be vicious because the ludicrousness  and the silliness of skating is already there.  Mm-hmm.  You understand?  Airplane worked because it was making ludicrous and parodying very serious things.  If you're going to parody something where they fucking have ruffles and they spin in  circles on the ice and you just do it with a wacky face.  It's just silly.  I'm sure there are skating enthusiasts who don't find skating silly, but everyone else 
[03:10:00]  does.  You're right.  So it's silly to start with.  Well, they had no chemistry.  I love Will Ferrell.  I think he's great.  But him and that other, that Napoleon guy.  John Hedder?  They had, there wasn't an ounce of comic gelling between them.  I think, Will Ferrell, I think he's great.  And the other guy I heard is good. 
[03:10:30]  I've never seen a ship.  John Hedder?  Yeah.  He is funny, man.  Yeah.  That fucking Napoleon Dynamite can't get enough of that stuff.  It's just a bad mix.  That was about it.  They just didn't have, they just didn't have an ounce of chemistry.  And it happens.  I did try to watch that movie.  It's not an easy one.  Oh, it's terrible.  Adam's running away from the show.  Well, someone is helping out Adam. 
[03:11:00]  On tonight's Rescue Me, Tommy, which is Dennis Leary, plays a hero in someone else's uniform,  which causes confusion in the firehouse.  That's tonight's episode on Rescue Me, 10 o'clock on FX.  That's right, Adam.  Are you in that one?  I think it might be my uniform.  Oh, Jesus.  Your uniform's in this one?  I did.  Great.  He's like the guy that wore the robot suit in Lost in Space and not the guy that does the voice.  Darth Vader. 
[03:11:30]  All right.  We go to break with the Dell phone call, but not an ounce of chemistry.  Of chemistry.  No.  Not even an ounce of chemistry together.  Nothing detectable?  No, it really was weird.  My girlfriend actually pointed that out because I was elbowing her chin for making me watch that piece of shit.  Hey, E-Rock did find the Fox clips.  It is funny because Fox is thinking about suing us because we've been using their sounder, and we've pretty much refused to stop. 
[03:12:00]  That's copywritten?  Well, who the fuck knows, man.  How can it be copywritten?  Just keep doing it until they...  Because we're making fun of their stupid sounder.  Well, do you remember when Shepard Smith said this?  No?  That was a great...  I don't remember when Shepard said...  That was a great setup, man.  Hold on a minute.  Do you remember when Shepard Smith said...  This?  This?  J-Lo's new song, Jenny from the Block, all about Lopez roots. 
[03:12:30]  About how she's still a neighborhood gal at heart.  But folks from that street in New York, the Bronx section, sound more likely to give her a curb job than a blowjob or a block party.  The New York Post...  We're sorry about that slip up there.  I have no idea how that happened.  But it won't happen again.  Yeah, we know.  And that's your news.  Yeah.  I know how it happened.  Anderson Cooper walked by.  I was going to go with a lot of Craig jokes myself, but you beat me too much.  Shepard, is that the guy who looks like the alien with too much makeup? 
[03:13:00]  Yeah, yeah.  The Studio B guy?  I think he's kind of a fan of ours.  I get that feeling.  Yeah.  Whenever he has to report on our debauchery, he seems to have a little smile on his face.  A little grin.  A little like, these guys are dead.  That was a great clip, though.  Blowjob?  Oh, fuck.  What did I just say?  Same network that wants to sue us over a dump sounder.  Yeah.  And when you're speaking of Fox, let's not forget this.  No?  The police chief says six officers were killed, including the district's top cock. 
[03:13:30]  Top cock after a cop after the vehicle they were riding in was sprayed with bullets.  Three other officers were hurt in the attack.  And those are your latest headlines.  I'm Jane Skinner.  Time to send you back to Shepard, who is live.  Where?  Step side of Memphis.  South Carolina Gamecock.  She's a big fan.  Go South Carolina.  Do you know how hard it is to read when everyone else in the studio is shaking with laughter at your discussion? 
[03:14:00]  I know.  I've been there, Jane.  It's been worse for many, many billions of times.  Just YouTube.  Do it now.  Wow.  It's Friday, Jane.  No one's watching.  They're out doing things.  It's just me, you, and Dorella down in the distance.  That's it.  We'll look for you on YouTube there, Jane.  Thanks so much.  Yeah, see, and they have a problem with us.  Come on.  That's barely news.  And see, Shep, he just loves that stuff.  Oh, yeah.  He's laughing his ass off. 
[03:14:30]  Shep's a fan, I know.  Steve from New Rochelle.  All right.  See, if he enjoys that kind of stuff, he would like this show.  Yeah.  So, you know, you can't just be.  Well, I'm sure he does.  It's not him suing you.  Right.  It's not Shepard.  Shepard Smith is suing us.  Is that it?  Using his sounder.  Okay.  Probably some muckety-muck.  Really?  A big mucker?  You think it's the head muckety-muck?  The big cheese?  I don't know.  Just one of the big guys.  A big wig.  Uh-oh.  The Grand Poobah?  Problem? 
[03:15:00]  Problem?  Provo.  Where's Provo?  Utah.  No.  Provo, Utah?  Provo, Utah.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I was thinking the Provo down in the Caribbean.  What is that called?  Provo.  Provolone?  Provolone.  Yeah, it is Utah.  Wow.  We got a hot chick missing.  First thing, I thought it was a pro...  Please.  All right.  Here's your Dell call as we go to break.  Dell Harbor Warranty Sport.  My name is ****.  How can I help you?  Well, my mom got one. 
[03:15:30]  Hello?  Can you hear me?  Yeah, I'm having a problem.  How about now?  I got my phone on.  Can you hear me now?  I can hear you.  You're breaking up a little bit.  Oh, great.  All right.  Well, what I got is my mom's laptop here, and it won't turn off.  It won't turn off?  No.  Okay.  Cannot turn it off.  Try to turn off the power, everything.  It won't turn off.  All right.  Can I get the service tag? 
[03:16:00]  Jesus Christ, I just gave it to you people.  All right.  Express service code is **** 419.  You got it?  I couldn't hear you very well.  You're yelling very loud.  **** 419, is that right?  Yeah, it's close enough.  All I need to know is how do you turn this goddamn thing off?  You know, your automated crap sucks, all right?  And I think you suck, all right?  Jesus Christ, how do you turn this fucking thing off? 
[03:16:30]  You understand that?  All right.  Well, I will just need to actually see what system you have here.  So I'm showing that you...  Can I get the name on the account?  It's ****.  All right.  And the phone number is purchased out?  Why do you need all this?  All I need to know is how do you turn this thing off?  I need to verify the owner of the system, sir.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  The number is **** 7-2. 
[03:17:00]  All right.  And can I get your name?  My name is ****.  And your last name?  I'm her son.  God damn you.  Fucking goddamn people, I swear to God.  And your phone number?  My phone number is the same.  Okay.  And your email address?  Why do you need that?  You know, you're upsetting the **** out of me, all right? 
[03:17:30]  You **** goddamn asshole.  Look, God damn it.  The **** thing, we want to shut off.  You understand that?  Since last night.  And you got a goddamn battery problem as well, all right?  What the hell the **** is going on with this goddamn thing?  I'm getting very upset about this.  You know, I've spent about an hour trying to talk to you people on this freaking automated  crap you got.  And that's what's got me all fucking upset like this, all right?  And if you didn't have all this automated crap on your goddamn phone system, then somebody 
[03:18:00]  would talk to a human.  Do you know what a human is?  Yes, sir, I do.  And I will...  You keep acting like a goddamn computer and keep asking me pretty stupid questions when  all I need to know is how do you shut this thing down?  It says Windows is shutting down.  It's been saying that since last night, all right?  Now, how come it won't shut down?  How come I can't shut it down?  What do I got to do?  Rip the damn battery out of the back of it?  Um, no, you definitely don't want to do that. 
[03:18:30]  But what do I got to do?  Will you please tell me?  Yes.  All I need...  So, do you not have an email address?  That's all I need from you.  Do you not have an email address?  I'm not going to give it to you, all right?  Let's put it that way, all right?  Because I have nothing to do with this goddamn computer.  All I want to know is how do you shut it down before it causes a goddamn fucking fire?  Will you fucking tell me?  All right.  So, to shut the system off,  Do you see the power button on it?  I've been pushing it for the past three fucking hours. 
[03:19:00]  It don't fucking do nothing.  Okay.  Hold down the power button for 10 seconds right now.  Well, Jesus Christ, you could have told me that.  You know, you are not very freaking helpful.  You know that?  You're fucking assholes.  And you can put this in your fucking records, all right?  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show.  The venomous voices of the vastly vulgar airwaves. 
[03:19:30]  Introducing the Destroyer.  Operator of the OCD organization, Opie.  The Professor.  The know-it-all neurotic Nancy Anthony.  Swing over to little Jimmy Dorton.  The worthless, chinless, box-a-master of laughs.  Meet the irritating extra of excrement E-Rock.  Or the swishy audio shim Steve C.  And don't forget Sam.  Black and white.  50-50 where it counts. 
[03:20:00]  Corrupting the cavities of hair holes everywhere.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony!  Oh, this is Marilyn Manson?  I was wondering.  I have no clue on this one.  Mob scene. 
[03:20:30]  All right.  War.  War.  Is this your wedding song, E-Rock?  Ooh.  No.  His what song?  The wedding song.  Remember?  He said he was engaged.  Oh, shit.  I forgot all about that.  I did, too.  With the much bigger news of Opie being engaged.  Really?  Someone is saying it's very white of E-Rock to get engaged as well.  Because everyone knows that half the marriages fail.  So that will help my marriage succeed.  Right.  He will be the one that gets divorced. 
[03:21:00]  Exactly.  Oh.  Poor E-Rock.  Why me?  Huh?  Maybe you'll get divorced.  Oh.  Oh.  What are you saying?  I don't see a problem with my potential marriage.  What did you say about his wife?  Yeah, but you want to say that nobody does.  Dude, no one.  Yeah.  Thank you, Adam.  Thank you.  You're.  Oh, God.  You say, will you marry me?  You don't say, will you take half my stuff?  Yeah.  You think people actually go into it thinking that it's going to fail?  Maybe a couple.  There might be a few.  I know the people at the wedding know it's going to fail. 
[03:21:30]  Yeah, yeah.  That's true.  The ones that hold on to the receipts for the gifts.  Yeah.  The people there, they look around and go, oh, boy.  Give each other that knowing look.  There's two envelopes.  One for the bride and one for the over-under.  The bookie.  Well, it's never good.  Well, first of all, you's lad bag was the one that said that.  Thank you.  From Boston.  That was my line.  All right.  Yeah, we've talked about it in the past.  You should never go to a wedding with cash that you're going to throw in an envelope.  Because you start looking around and go, oh, man. 
[03:22:00]  This ain't going to work.  This ain't working out.  I'm going to buy another round of drinks at the bar.  Or I'm going to tip real well.  Well, next thing you know, you had good intentions of giving them a nice amount of money.  And it's dwindling as the wedding goes on.  But that's not your fault.  You came with good intentions.  Yeah.  Your better judgment kicked in.  Oh, I've been at weddings where people actually, they go, this is bullshit.  I don't want to name names, but I was once at a wedding like, this is bullshit. 
[03:22:30]  This ain't going to work.  I like this.  I can't believe we have to be here.  The question, when they give you the question.  So, how long do you think this is going to last?  All right.  Now I've got to answer.  I don't want to answer that, Reverend.  I'm sorry.  Yeah.  Thank you, Julian Wisconsin.  A lot of congratulations.  That's good.  Hey, Lane S. from Phoenix.  Yeah.  And I would address Lane S.  All right.  From Phoenix.  Because Lane S. from Phoenix is a douche. 
[03:23:00]  Just an ass.  Wow.  A dumb fuck.  What the fuck, guys?  I pay for XM and I have to listen to this censored shit.  Why do I even have a subscription?  That was during the Dell customer service phone call that we were playing.  And yes, there were indeed beeps in it alongside of the shits, motherfuckers, cocksuckers, and 
[03:23:30]  every other word that the guy blurted out in anger.  Right.  And the reason is because XM finally is censoring us.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We mentioned that like what?  Yesterday.  Oh, of course.  Just deal with it, man.  What a dumb motherfucker.  He was kidding.  Yeah, of course.  Oh.  You.  I don't like him talking to you that way.  I wasn't kidding.  You got the email from Logan.  I don't know if he just emailed us.  That we're only allowed to have three motherfuckers per bit? 
[03:24:00]  Yeah.  Pretty much, yeah.  I have mail, I have spam, and I'm boring.  And guess which one of his go-to?  All right.  Well.  Yeah.  So, uh, Lane, Lane S.  Stop.  All right.  We got Oberman.  Lane Staley.  Is that who it is?  You can't say last names.  There you go.  Mm-hmm.  And phone numbers.  It was personal info.  Dummy.  And emails and stuff that was in that call, you dumb shit. 
[03:24:30]  Now write back and say, I'm sorry, I was a stupid fucking dick bag.  And stop trying to find the picture on the XM radio.  There's no picture.  It's not a television.  Dunce.  Dalt.  Elo sent me an email in the middle of the fucking night saying that we should take a peek at  Oberman's bush rant from last night.  Oh, I saw it.  Did you really?  Yeah.  I fucking hate Keith Oberman.  He's a cunt.  Cunt.  He is a cunt. 
[03:25:00]  Cunt.  Cunt.  Fucking faggot.  Sucking up to Jesse Jackson like that.  He makes me sick.  Sucked up.  That I miss.  I, I, just so you know, just so you know, uh, Reverend, I was, I was behind the scenes  supporting his phone.  I was a big fan of his when he was doing sports scores for ESPN and then he moved over and  I'm like, this guy is kind of interesting.  And then he showed his true colors, uh, especially during the I miss thing, that whole I miss  thing was going on.  And, and then after I was got fired, he was all over his show.  God, I was one of these guys behind the scenes saying they should fire him. 
[03:25:30]  Yeah.  Him and Al Roker.  Well, yeah.  Why didn't you have the balls to say, well, before I miss got fired, why'd you have to  be a good little boy and keep quiet until, uh, until you knew the coast was clear and  that I miss, uh, cleared out his shit.  Yeah.  He's a prick.  Fuck.  Fucking douche.  Jealous.  He's probably just a jealous baby because he's the prime.  Where's that rant?  Do we have that?  Find it.  Cause Overman, I was one of these guys.  So we can, we shouldn't tolerate this kind of behavior. 
[03:26:00]  It's like, all right, we'll do it before.  Yeah.  Why don't you just get on the air that day?  You're live every day.  Go ahead.  Jump on air and speak your mind.  Not after the fact.  Oh, I hate him.  Just sucking up to Jesse Jackson.  We get it.  You're the white guy.  Who's a good one.  Yeah.  One of the good ones.  You're okay.  The black people approve of you, Keith.  You fucking groveling left-wing douche.  But I guess he, uh, he went after Bush last night or something.  Elo thought it was terrific.  Uh-oh. 
[03:26:30]  I hope it is then.  Maybe it is.  I don't know.  I haven't heard it.  You saw it, Adam?  I saw it.  Was it good?  I liked it.  That's good the media is impartial, though.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's not like Fox being impartial.  They are.  They're not.  It's not news.  It's opinion in news.  Fox is very conservative.  But, you know, most of the other ones tend to be left-leaning.  But Fox, it's amazing how everybody points at Fox, and they are conservative.  Sure.  Because people are so used to the liberal slant.  Yeah.  And immediately, when you look at the money they donate, almost 75 or 80% of the money  they donate is all to Democrats, which is fine.  I don't care. 
[03:27:00]  But just don't deny it.  They deny it.  Wolf Blitzer, you're going to tell me he's not fucking left-leaning?  Come on.  Of course he is.  This stupid situation room music.  I like when Cheney scared the shit out of him.  When he asked about the daughter.  When Wolf Blitzer was asking about the daughter.  Oh, yeah.  Cheney gave him the death raise.  Yeah.  And his beard just kind of started smoking.  No, no, we like your daughter.  You know what?  Enough with Cheney, too.  You're fucking in an administration that fucking does nothing but shit on gay people.  And you have to kiss one on the cheek every holiday and say, Daddy loves you, you fucking phony. 
[03:27:30]  How about having some moral courage and standing up for your own daughter?  Thank you.  Fucking prick.  Here's Keith Oberman after Imus got fired.  This is what he had to say on his show.  Stipulating, sir, that I was one of those NBC employees who put it out to my bosses behind  the scenes that this could not stand, that this change involving Don Imus had to be made.  I can say that.  Didn't these type of guys get beat up in school?  Yeah.  The behind the scenes fuck faces?  Stipulating, sir. 
[03:28:00]  I was behind closed doors making sure no one would know.  And I told him a thing or two.  Could not stand.  Why didn't you attack him on the air, man?  This change had to be made change.  Because he wasn't brave enough, because he wasn't sure where MSNBC was, you know, what  they were thinking at the time.  What a douche.  To my bosses behind the scenes that this could not stand, that this change involving Don  Imus had to be made.  I can say that now.  I respected my employers and did not say it until they reached this conclusion, which  I am.  Hold on.  I could say that.  I could say this now. 
[03:28:30]  Well, you could have said it beforehand, but you weren't brave enough.  Yeah, you're honest.  Because you weren't sure if your job would be in jeopardy if you spoke your mind, you douche.  You're honest enough to trash the president, and that's fine.  Oh, yeah.  Trash him.  Fuck him.  But what?  You respected the bosses enough to not?  You fucking company man.  You jealous fucking hall monitor prick.  Fuck you.  Imus ruins guys like this, and he probably is the type of guy that got fucking verbally  beat up by Imus. 
[03:29:00]  If not him, but he's the type that Imus was verbally beat up.  Yeah.  Fucking ugh.  And Imus had to be made.  I can say that now.  I respected my employers and did not say it until they reached this conclusion, which  I applaud sincerely.  Let me ask you again about the other people.  Is someone like Rush Limbaugh, how have they kept their time slots?  Will there be an increased effort to either get them to contain themselves within the rounds  of decency?  Are they on the ropes?  Are they on probation because of this? 
[03:29:30]  There must be a renewed sensitivity and-  Shut up.  It's just a bit there.  That moron, marbled mouth.  Ugh.  Douche.  I'm not even going to acknowledge that Jesse Jackson spoke there.  Do you hear the groveling?  It's the Oberman part that really drives us.  Do you hear the groveling?  Especially, why would a liberal try to shut a conservative up?  Should Rush Limbaugh be-  Dude, you fucking faggot.  Just go up against him in his own medium and destroy him if he's no good.  What's the problem?  Yeah, what the fuck? 
[03:30:00]  What's the fat douche?  Smash him.  Oh, boy.  Not to interrupt, but Rita Cosby or Crosby?  Rita Cosby.  No R.  Cosby.  Cos?  Cosby.  No R.  I thought it was Rita Crosby.  I think it's Rita Crosby.  No, it's Cosby.  She's standing by her words.  It's Rita Throat Polyp.  Yeah.  Well, they got rid of her because, I don't know, I think they had it with her voice and she's the  one doing the tell-all book on Anna Smith and she's basically claiming that Larry Burkhead  and Howard K. Stern sucked each other's cocks and Howard K. Stern has come out and said, 
[03:30:30]  look, I'm going to sue Larry Burkhead.  I'm going to sue Rita Crosby.  He's not saying that she's standing by her words.  Standing by my words.  I know that this is a fact.  I'm going to stand by my words.  For people that watch news shows, this is very funny.  Yeah, right?  Because it's just so hard to listen to.  I'm standing by my words.  I guess she's going to be on Bill O'Reilly tonight. 
[03:31:00]  We'll see.  Oh, great.  Another one.  All right.  Anyway, here's Douchebag from last night.  And so he is back from his annual surprise gratuitous photo op in Iraq and what a sorry spectacle  it was.  But it was nothing compared to the spectacle of one unfiltered, unguarded, horrifying quotation  in the new biography to which Mr. Bush has consented.  As he deceived the troops at Al-Asad Air Force Base yesterday with the tantalizing prospect  that some of them might not have to risk being killed and might get instead to go home.  Mr. Bush probably did not know that. 
[03:31:30]  With his own words, he had already been proved to be a liar.  That he had been lying, is lying, will be lying about Iraq.  He presumably did not know that there had already appeared those damning experts from  Robert Draper's book, Dead Certain.  I'm playing for October, November, Mr. Bush said to Draper.  That evidently is the time during which he thinks he can sell us the real plan, which is  to quote him, to get us in a position where the presidential candidates will become comfortable  about sustaining a presence. 
[03:32:00]  Comfortable, that is, with saying about Iraq, again quoting the president, stay longer.  And there it is, sir.  We've caught you.  Your goal is not to bring some troops home, maybe, if we let you have your way now.  Your goal is not to set the stage for eventual withdrawal.  You are, to use your own disrespectful, tone-deaf word, playing at getting the next Republican  nominee to agree to jump into this bottomless pit with you and take us into it with him as  we stay in Iraq for another year and another and another and anon. 
[03:32:30]  Everything you said about Iraq yesterday and everything you will say is a deception for  the purpose of this one cynical, unacceptable, brutal goal, perpetuating this war indefinitely.  War today, war tomorrow, war forever.  And you are playing at it.  Playing!  A man with any self-respect, having inadvertently revealed such an evil secret, would have already  resigned and fled the country.  You have no remaining credibility about Iraq, sir.  Boy, Keith, you're brave, sir. 
[03:33:00]  Did you run that past your boss to make sure he was okay with it?  Said some good things there.  Yeah, sir.  I don't even disagree with him.  I just don't like the fucking guy.  I hate the way he sucked Jesse Jackson's dick.  And that is what you did as a man.  You knelt in front of another man and you racially groveled so that you could be one of the  white guys he approved of.  And then you went after conservatives that had nothing to do with the story.  Tapped his foot under the desk, touched feet, and then it was all over. 
[03:33:30]  Ran his hand under the desk.  I got no problem with that bush right there, though.  No.  No, that was...  I kind of had enough of a bush.  Hey, Oberman, Eugene Levy called.  He wants his anchovy eyebrows back.  Nate Sack.  And Kelly Forrest, what's up?  All right.  Hey, why don't we do line of the day and get the fuck out of here?  A line of the day.  That's what I say.  A line of the day.  We would promote Rescue Me, but Adam really doesn't know what's happening.  Yes, I do. 
[03:34:00]  Tonight, Tommy switches uniforms and wackiness ensues in the firehouse.  Second to last episode before the season finale.  And Dennis is nominated for an Emmy.  Congratulations.  For which show?  For...  No, I know, Rest of Me, but which episode I should have said?  I think just his body of work on the season.  Oh, look at that.  Look at that.  Nice.  I can't wait to get him back on the show.  Yeah, he'll be back.  He's a bit self-serving.  He pumps up and gets all, like, muscled out. 
[03:34:30]  Does a lot of scenes with his shirt off.  Does a lot of scenes with him banging broads.  You know what?  If I was writing a show...  I guess you're right.  That's what I was getting at.  That's what I was getting at.  It's very obvious when you watch some of these shows who the main...  You know what?  Because he's in...  I've always liked Gina Gershon.  Let's create a character.  He's in the best scenes, man.  Man, that first season, all he was was fucking naked banging broads.  I'm like, I guess he's the main...  There you go.  He's the head writer on this one.  He would find that funny. 
[03:35:00]  Don't worry, Adam.  Oh, I know.  It's okay.  Adam motherfuckers literally behind his...  That's the beauty of Adam.  Yeah.  You have your shirt off again, sir.  Adam's like, I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm out.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Let's move on.  Oh, also a reminder from my brother, Elmo.  Is this an actual quote from Elmo?  It was from the feedback, yeah.  All right.  This is a reminder from my brother, Elmo.  Brother Elmo on MySpace.  We need hookers and strippers for our unsavory uncles.  Unsavory uncles?  For the bachelor party for Brett. 
[03:35:30]  Right, right.  For Brett, the other brother who's getting married Sunday.  Yes.  Which brings up the question, will you be having a bachelor party?  I was talking to E-Rock.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Okay.  E-Rock?  I want to know.  Yeah, E-Rock, we want to know.  I don't care about E-Rock.  It'll be awful.  All he'll want is a sub.  You.  Yeah, we'll have to figure something out, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And I want your fiancé to rest assured that I, as a friend, will take it upon myself to 
[03:36:00]  provide the entertainment.  Oh, my God.  Can you imagine?  You should go into business, dude.  Side business.  You should, like, plan bachelor parties.  No, nobody would enjoy it.  Why are we just riding around the meatpacking dish with this money out?  Trust me, boys.  It's going to be fun.  Anyone can go to a strip club.  That's right.  See, now look at the parallels here.  Jimmy Norton will be planning your bachelor party, and E-Rock's just going to have 101 
[03:36:30]  Dalmatians at his.  The last bachelor party I was at was at my brother Quinn's, and my dad was getting a lap  dance.  God rest his soul.  And he didn't know the rules of the lap dance, and the dancer brought a friend with her,  a big monster of a guy, and my dad is basically telling the girl how beautiful she is as he  kind of has his hands all over her.  Oh, there's no touching.  He wasn't touching any of the old private parts, but he was touching enough where the  bouncer was moving forward and was ready to knock my dad's teeth out. 
[03:37:00]  Did you save him, or did you let him out?  He had no clue of the rules.  Yeah, just watch.  The rules of the lap dance.  There are stupid rules.  Yeah.  No touching.  Dumb fucking goon.  Has to step in.  Fucking suitcase pimp.  Ugh, just carry her bags.  Yeah.  No touching.  I hope my jizz gets all over your front seat on your drive home. 
[03:37:30]  It's time for a line of the day.  Oh, line of the day.  Runner-up line of the day.  We got a couple.  Here's the first.  I had a lot of engrams.  Did you?  Yeah, they told me.  I said, what's an engram?  They said, well, it's something that's blocking you from getting to your ultimate goal.  And I looked at the guy and went, you're a fucking engram.  Get out of my way.  I'm getting on the subway.  How do they say to cure that?  Like, you have to hop on one leg and blow John Travolta?  Like, what's the cure for this one?  I didn't like that.  Blow John Travolta. 
[03:38:00]  I got one.  I didn't like that because I felt it was a little hurtful.  I jumped.  I knew you had something.  I was like, he ain't beating me to this one.  I don't even know if I did, actually.  You were in there.  You were starting something.  I said, no, no, no.  I know this one will work.  That's very rare when I know something's going to work.  Here's another runner-up line of the day.  And I'm like, okay, it's your turn.  Make a wish.  And you disappeared.  All of a sudden, he's taller and black with a much bigger ball than his pants. 
[03:38:30]  I'm sorry.  That's not what happened.  Yeah, of course.  No, I would say that that should have ended that you disappeared.  Oh.  It was, I think.  That was a tag team.  That was definitely.  Tag team.  We'll share that one.  Yeah, that was definitely a tag team, man.  How does that happen?  What?  B-52 mistakenly flies across country with nuclear warheads carrying six nukes.  How do you forget that?  That's something you should absolutely know if it's on your plane or not. 
[03:39:00]  They usually only train them across, right?  Oops.  That's one of those things like, ah, we need to get this over there.  Yeah.  That's a big problem.  Someone found out.  Someone found out.  I said, ah, it was a mistake.  How did it leak out?  What, one of the baggage handlers found it?  Yeah, we can't bring water on a fucking flight to Florida.  Yeah, but the military's going, oops, six nukes.  Oopsie.  Are they in a plastic bag?  Ah, yeah.  All right.  Court size. 
[03:39:30]  All right, take your shoes off.  You got to x-ray your shoes.  And, uh, Adam, thanks for coming by.  Always good to see you guys.  And congratulations to both of you.  Thank you, sir.  Congratulations.  Jimmy, nothing but the best, my friend.  You'd be happy.  Thank you.  I got a mouth to fuck.  You should congratulate him.  What?  You should congratulate Anthony, too.  I got nothing to be congratulated for.  What?  Yeah, you did well in, in, in, uh, the conversation.  Ah, that's fine.  That's, uh, goes without saying.  Look at you.  Happens every week. 
[03:40:00]  Ah.  You are on a roll.  Ah, meh.  You're like Richard Dreyfuss.  I'm having a very good day.  Very good day.  When do you take the private plane back to Mohegan Sun?  Well, um, I don't know.  Now I got so many people that want to go.  I'd need a B-52 to fit everybody.  Everyone's going, so, can I go with you?  Yeah, but they-  Well, tell Mohegan Sun they gotta get a big enough plane.  You got people that can sit and gamble at your level?  Well.  Mr. Bond?  No. 
[03:40:30]  Mohegan Sun wants their money back, Adam.  Oh, I know.  They'll see.  They're giving them the suite that no one else has ever seen.  Yeah.  They're giving them the private jet.  The magical teepee you get to stay in.  Well, we were just talking about the Boston thing.  And, uh, if that does happen, I'll drive up and then drive back down and have the weekend  maybe to stay over it.  Don't drive up.  No, you gotta take the jet.  Yeah, we'll send a magic carpet for you.  But, but I gotta be in Boston first, so I can't take the jet to Boston. 
[03:41:00]  Take it maybe from Boston, but then I gotta drive, you know, what if I lose?  They'd send you out with your bags and say, the jet, uh, is broken.  It was one way.  Oh, that'd be cool.  The jet's busted.  You know they want to do that to you.  You get Don Rickles in Casino.  Yeah.  Better it happen down here.  Better it happen down here.  God forbid.  How great is Don Rickles?  He's great.  I saw him on Charlie Rose the other night.  I was thinking the other day that, uh, we're just too, we're too young.  I was gonna say too old, but we-  For what?  But we're too young to fully appreciate how great Don Rickles was. 
[03:41:30]  Oh, CPO Sharky.  Yes.  But I'm just saying, like, right?  Jimmy knows what I'm saying.  He's one of these guys I would have searched out and went and saw live.  I was watching him on YouTube recently, yesterday, Friday night, and there's a clip of him  Letterman in 82, and he's teasing Letterman, and he's, he's older now, um, Lucky Louie  in season two, Louie had we got in season two, but you know, Flight of the Conchords  did, and probably better.  I'm sure it's a better show.  Um, uh, Lucky, he wanted Don Rickles to play my father in an episode, but they said that 
[03:42:00]  Don is, he's not as workable as he was.  Right.  But, in 82, he's on Letterman, and he's just a shithead.  He's really funny.  He's great at being a shithead.  And he's teasing the black guy.  He's like, look at the black kid.  And he's just teasing, and he goes, look, I'm white, you're black.  Sorry, that's the brakes.  And blah, blah, blah, right back.  Sorry, that's the brakes.  Can we find that one?  Oh, is he funny?  Yeah, just look up Rickles, 82.  He was just...  Was it 82?  We got 88?  Yeah.  Go 82.  82. 
[03:42:30]  I would love to hear this now.  I think part one.  You'd have to, no, you'd have to get it for tomorrow, because you'd have to go through  it, because it's like a 10 minute clip.  This whole friggin, uh...  You have to get it from the middle somewhere.  82, yeah.  The internet video thing is really getting...  It's wonderful.  I don't know if it is.  Why?  I just don't know.  Why?  What'd you do?  I have this weird...  What'd you do you hope doesn't get out?  No, no, no.  It's just this weird thing that's going on.  There's...  Everything...  I got...  ...is available.  I got me...  And there are going to be complete shut-ins.  I got a video of me getting high in Boston. 
[03:43:00]  Um, New Year's Eve, 1988, 89.  Yeah?  Wearing a really bad sweater.  Is it on?  I'm going to put it up on YouTube, I decided.  Let's throw it up there.  There you go.  I got to find out.  It's hilarious how bad it is.  I want to find the old RDTV tapes.  Ah, remember those?  Yeah, we made videotapes.  I think everybody did.  But it's just...  I don't know.  There was some guy on, what the hell's show was it?  Colbert's show.  Uh, talking about how the internet is making, uh, not only just the obvious where people 
[03:43:30]  don't interact anymore, but it's making amateurs, uh, into writers and artists and everything  where, I mean, it might sound elitist, but there are people that would get to a certain  point to get to television, to get to radio, to get to, um, uh, publish a book because they  were, uh, talented, they had something to say, they had something meaningful or something. 
[03:44:00]  But now, everybody is a journalist, is a photographer, is a movie maker, is a...  So it does...  It takes...  It doesn't make that special anymore.  I was looking...  I was thinking of the same exact thing yesterday, walking home.  Yeah?  And I was thinking, what about, uh, before YouTube and, uh, cable TV and all this, all  the people that were talented enough that never got a shot.  Well, that's just it.  It's part luck, too.  But that's... 
[03:44:30]  Like I'm saying, it might be...  There was only a handful of douches in Hollywood that were deciding who was talented and who  was not.  Now you got so many more opportunities to get your shit out there.  And I'm thinking, you know, there's people that, uh, are pretty talented that are getting  their, their, their, their time in the spotlight.  But, but a lot of the stuff that is the most popular stuff isn't based in talent.  That's just it.  Based in stupidity.  It's based in just...  Well, I was thinking more...  Moronic.  I was thinking more like bands and stuff because you had a handful of, like, program directors,  pompous ass PDs that were deciding which band should make and which shouldn't. 
[03:45:00]  And now because of the internet and MySpace and all these other outlets, you, you...  I, I, I wondered how many of these bands that are out today would have made it 20 years  ago or 10 years ago, 15 years, whatever.  It is nice to have the option because, uh, TV, you're right.  At one point when it was all in the family and it was these great shows, but then look  at VH1.  Uh-huh.  They had great programming, I thought.  Like, they were really, uh, uh, innovative with music.  I mean, the little things like pop-up video, they had all this really cool stuff. 
[03:45:30]  And now it is just one dog shit reality show after another.  Yeah.  They're all the same with the same fucking lack of tension, faggot music bed.  It's awful.  So I like the internet because it's like an option to present you with alternatives.  There's no advertisers fucking raping the artists creatively by forcing their opinion  in.  And it forces television to be better because now they see the millions of hits these  other things are getting.  And it's like, you dummies, people are watching this and not your shit anymore. 
[03:46:00]  So you better put better stuff on it.  There's also, like, fact being, or fiction being presented as fact, which is, you know,  uh.  It's always been that way, though.  Uh, not as much now.  Bloggers are out there just, and bloggers are being used by the news as sources.  Right.  And you read, where the fuck did this guy get his facts?  Like, that stupid, uh, uh, 9-11 thing that guy put together, Loose Change.  That fucking thing is pure fiction by some dopey jack-off that, uh, just twisted, uh, facts 
[03:46:30]  around to suit his own needs.  And people actually will sit there and argue with you that, did you see it?  Look at Loose Change.  They say that this, and you go, no, that's the bullshit.  It's, it's a lie.  It's a big fucking lie.  But can I say, and, and, and the, the, the rebuttal to Loose Change is also available.  And all the information presented on Loose Change, you can go out and find easily. 
[03:47:00]  So it's almost like where years ago, if they did a special on TV and they gave you, like,  this is it.  Mm-hmm.  Like, when they, you know, they attacked Jim Garrison, say, many years ago for, for  the Kennedy assassination.  Yeah.  Uh, prosecution.  There was no way to find other facts or rebuttals, but now you can go online and find  anything.  Yeah.  So it's almost like as much as they don't go dog shit at you.  But you, you're not gonna know what's true when you go look, you go to Wikipedia, it's  some idiot putting shit up there.  That's true.  Yeah.  You have to do your homework, but I mean, the options are.  You're giving people too much credit. 
[03:47:30]  Yeah, you give the, the basic moral.  Adam, you better check Wikipedia tonight.  Oops.  What?  Oops.  You don't know what our fans are capable of.  But I'm saying television gives you what they give you, and there's no other option.  We can grab an encyclopedia, at least online.  You're giving people too much credit that they actually do check.  Well, fuck them.  I mean, me.  And cross-reference their shit.  Yeah.  You know, oh, look at this.  Do I believe that?  Let me check here.  People don't do that.  They read something and go, dude, you know what I heard?  But there's another example of TV not getting it, because Jimmy said, like, it makes TV better. 
[03:48:00]  A story we didn't mention today, really fast.  Emmy censors Justin, Justin Timberlake.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  And they write it this way.  An extremely popular, raunchy holiday song that Justin Timberlake sang on Saturday Night Live last December and has been nominated for an Emmy Award will probably not make it onto the Emmy cast this month.  It's huge on the internet.  We're talking about, obviously, Dick in a Box, right?  I don't think it's going to happen, an Emmy source told The Post.  The song Dick in a Box is up for an award for original music and lyrics, and Timberlake was approached about performing it as long as he cleans up the lyrics to be more family-oriented. 
[03:48:30]  Another example of TV still not getting the fact that people are going to the internet in probes.  But if they're recognizing it with an Emmy nomination, or did it win an Emmy Award?  It's nominated.  If they're recognizing it, why wouldn't...  That is a tough one.  I'll say this, though.  And Timberlake has reportedly refused.  Good for him.  Good.  Mm-hmm.  That's a tough one to kind of get.  Like, that, I think, puts TV in a weird position. 
[03:49:00]  It's almost like, all right, we have these...  Because the FCC won't look at it like the internet.  The FCC will just throw...  I wonder about that.  ...a tremendous fine at them.  The FCC doesn't give a fuck about the internet.  They don't care about TV ratings.  Yeah.  They care about representing the fucking federal government, whatever the mood is, and they're about fining you and getting money for...  Right.  I wonder if it's, you know, if there's a violation there.  I really don't know.  Because they're not basically talking about a dick in a box.  Are they or no?  I never heard the song.  Well, basically, they're talking about a dick in a puss, but, you know... 
[03:49:30]  Yeah.  But they're keeping it kind of like, you know, double entendre.  Right.  Here's your line of the day.  Ooh.  Here...  The music to line of the day.  Here comes...  The line of the day.  The line of the day.  The line of the day.  The line of the day.  The line of the day.  The line of the day.  I didn't know...  Oh, a line's against.  There's two A's.  Yeah.  And one D.  Just the way I like it. 
[03:50:00]  Yeah.  Just shut up.  Ooh.  I didn't mean that directed at you.  No, I like that, though.  I know, but that's just how the line of the day is going to end, because that's what we do on the show.  We get a little weird thing, and we end the line of the day with a weird thing.  And according to E-Rock, the soon-to-be-married, emotional, sweet E-Rock.  The emotional wreck.  That is E-Rock.  He basically is a fucking, just a bag of just misplaced emotion.  We can play Dick in a Box to break. 
[03:50:30]  Andy Samberg recorded an O&A intro for this song.  Oh, let's do that.  I missed Andy when he was in.  He was fun.  Yes.  Let's do that then.  Adam, thanks.  Thanks.  Always good seeing you guys.  Thank you there, pally.  Improv, West Palm Beach.  Improv, West Palm Beach.  Tomorrow through Sunday.  Tonight, Rescue Me, 10 o'clock FX.
