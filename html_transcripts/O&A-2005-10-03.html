<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a discussion about listener backlash regarding Jimmy Norton's temporary absence and Bill Burr's fill-in hosting.  Opie and Anthony, using considerable profanity, lamented the inconsistency and negativity of online fan reactions.  They discussed an email from a distraught Norton, addressing the criticism he'd received, referencing his HBO show, upcoming Jay Leno appearance, and his foot injury. Anthony then launched into a raunchy account of a graphic scene from HBO's "Rome,"  leading to a discussion of the show's gratuitous sex and casting. Opie interjected with a story about a confrontation with an angry man (possibly a Howard Stern listener) whose license plate read "Angry Black."  The conversation weaved in discussion of Opie's new restaurant, the Jets, and a spider incident at Robert Kelly's comedy show.  Robert Kelly and Bill Burr were mentioned as frequent topics throughout this initial segment.

The show continued with a meandering discussion about Opie's brother's damaged restaurant, shifting to football, specifically Tom Brady, the Giants' success, and Michael Vick's injury (discussed with significant profanity).  They revisited a past radio bit involving Joe Pesci and "Angry Baby," before transitioning to Robert Kelly filling in for Norton, leading to banter about Opie's stand-up. A humorous Robert Kelly soundbite remix about a knee injury was played.  Anthony's complaints about a falling object repeatedly landing on his injured foot followed, leading to discussion about their XM Radio anniversary, contrasting their plans with those of another XM host.  Their upcoming Halloween party and costume plans were also discussed.  The conversation then jumped to Elian Gonzalez's pro-Castro stance on 60 Minutes, a man who bought a "Hot Shannon" body mold, and a 60 Minutes segment about a man with multiple personalities, described in graphic detail, interspersed with Bill Burr impressions.  Critique of reality TV shows, specifically "Extreme Home Makeovers" and "Pimp My Ride," followed. Bob Kelly revealed he was a foster child, prompting a brief discussion.  The arrival of Christopher Knight and his girlfriend, Adrian, changed the show's dynamic, focusing on Adrian's appearance and jokes about the guests, "Rome," and Barry's legal troubles. The segment concluded with a humorous anniversary movie trailer recap created by Laszlo and Martini Steve.

The next segment focused heavily on Christopher Knight and Adrienne, their relationship, age gap, and sex life, including explicit details of their sexual practices and Adrienne's dominatrix tendencies.  Knight’s time on *The Surreal Life* was discussed, including anecdotes about Vern, a midget he spun around until he got sick, and Chyna’s drug use.  Discussions covered *The Brady Bunch*, pornography (including Knight seeing his ex-roommate in a pornographic film), and the reactions of Knight's family and friends to his relationship.  Numerous listener calls contributed to the show’s chaotic nature.

A subsequent segment continued the graphic discussion of Knight and Adrienne's relationship, with detailed descriptions of genitalia, sex, and bodily functions, using highly offensive language. Knight discussed his girlfriend's perceived criticisms of his body, his weight, and bowel movements.  The discussion included *My Fair Brady* and an upcoming episode featuring Knight’s father. Patrice O'Neal joined the show, offering commentary with similarly crude language.  Topics included the aging Brady Bunch cast, racial stereotypes, and opinions on Billy Burr. Bob Kelly discussed his foster care experience and a juvenile arrest at age 11.  He described his time in juvenile detention facilities using graphic language.

The final segment featured Patrice O'Neal and frequent caller Sandy Kane. O'Neal detailed his traumatic childhood, including foster care, juvenile detention, sexual abuse, and violence, connecting these experiences to his comedy.  His volatile personality was highlighted, with the hosts commenting on his tendency towards violence.  Discussions covered New York street basketball, suppressed rage, O'Neal's relationship with his mother, comedy as a cathartic outlet, and the hosts’ own history. Pictures of a guest’s girlfriend were mentioned as being on the website. A listener requested Patrice's advice column be renamed "Dear Apey." Sandy Kane participated in a highly offensive exchange.  The show's first anniversary was celebrated with a comedic recap of near-death experiences. A segment of O'Neal's advice column, containing crude commentary, was read. O'Neal's upcoming HBO special was promoted, and a caller who won an auction item participated briefly.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Thank you for listening. 
[00:00:30]  Thank you for listening. 
[00:01:00]  Thank you for listening. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you for listening. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you for listening. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you.  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  Oh, he's laughing in the wrong places. 
[00:04:00]  Ben, where's the quality?  He rocks.  Hopefully he's going through a car wash with his mouth open.  And there's Steve.  Steve is a piece of garbage.  And you're stinking.  You are cordially invited to a robbery rape.  This is family entertainment.  The show is the show is a disaster.  The show is a disaster.  The show is a disaster.  If you have any poo, bring it now.  But enough of this palaver.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  I'm about to strangle you out of your own consciousness. 
[00:04:30]  I'm about to strangle you out of your own consciousness.  I'm about to strangle you out of your own consciousness.  You folks go on your face.  You get an F minus in my book.  In my book.  I'm about to strangle you out of your own consciousness. 
[00:05:00]  And one more Tom Sizemore shooting a load.  Oh, motherfucker.  Yeah, that's a good one.  Sounds like he's in love. 
[00:05:30]  Yeah.  Welcome to the O.P. and Anthony program.  Hi.  Good morning.  How be everyone today?  Lovely.  It's fucking Monday.  We hate this.  Yeah.  I slept well last night, too.  Oh, good for you.  Good thing.  And I just feel really tired today.  I was up every hour.  Because it's, you know, Sunday night.  It's Monday.  Okay.  Sleep gets all screwed up.  Exhausted. 
[00:06:00]  Eh, people work for a living, though.  Who are we to complain, Opie?  Really?  If you think about it.  Really.  I actually love doing this show with you, Anthony.  Of course.  It's been a pleasure for over ten years now.  I do, too.  Two.  And I want to thank you for making me a better broadcaster.  Oh, God damn.  Because if it wasn't for you, I'd still be, I would still be doing two for Tuesdays.  Ah, and I would be snipping sheet metal and installing it in ungrateful people's attics. 
[00:06:30]  Thank you, Opie.  Now that the mutual admiration bullshit's out of the way, look who's sitting in today.  Robert Kelly.  That was so cute, guys.  Now, Bobby, not too much pressure on you.  Yeah.  Not too much pressure.  Right.  We have, of course, Jimmy Norton.  Yes.  And then, of course, we have Bill Burr.  Billy Burr, Jimmy Norton's successor.  Who, as you know, did very well.  I'm waiting for little Jimmy's photo to be taken off that website. 
[00:07:00]  There'll be two little redheads up there.  I'm waiting to hear Jimmy just put a shotgun in his mouth and blew his fucking brains out.  We had Billy on for like a week and a half.  You know, Jimmy, what the hell?  What the fuck's going on?  He's fucking...  What the hell?  He's fucking...  Jimmy or Angry Baby.  Which one was it?  That was Jimmy as an Angry Baby.  That was very good.  Angry Baby.  Yeah, Jimmy is not happy with some of the listeners of this fine radio program.  Holy shit.  And I don't blame him. 
[00:07:30]  I don't blame him.  It's one reason I don't really pay too much attention to the message boards these days.  No.  After one show of Jimmy being gone, there were actually people on the message boards going,  Ah, Open Ant don't need Jimmy anymore.  It's obvious.  Yeah.  After one fucking show.  These are the same people.  Of him going off to Hollywood to do a special project.  These were the same people that were going, you know, show is going to suck so bad when  Jimmy's gone.  I don't think ONA can handle the show by themselves before they knew, you know, Bill was coming 
[00:08:00]  in.  And then it's like, Bill's coming.  Fuck this.  Without Jimmy, this is going to stink.  And then Bill comes in and does a great job.  Who needs Jimmy?  These motherfuckers.  You just want to choke them.  As soon as Jimmy comes back, me and Keith are going over to a fucking U-Haul truck because  he's out of a job.  Billy's going to be in here.  Nice, Billy.  Here's the truth of the matter.  No matter how good Billy's feeling, no matter how bad Jimmy's feeling, no matter if Bill  Burr was part of the Open Anthony show since the NEW days and came here with us, was here 
[00:08:30]  for a year, got an offer to go out to L.A. to do something, went out, and Jimmy Norton  sat in for him for two weeks and Jim is spouting off his shit that Jimmy does, people would  be like, this guy is so great, fuck Bill Burr, we don't need him anymore, obviously Jimmy's  better for the show, it would be the same exact thing backwards.  I'll go one step further, after Robert Kelly, never mind. 
[00:09:00]  Ah, you just made me almost have to poo, you set up, you shit.  Did you see your face, though?  You're all like, there we go.  I did, I really did chime up, didn't I?  Yeah.  You got all happy, like, hey.  It's going to all be the same about me, all those fuckers.  I got to be honest, though, my feet started to swing under the table, I was so happy.  You got all happy, you had that look, like, here comes the compliment.  My toes started, like, jingling.  All kidding aside, then Robert Kelly's going to kill and they're going to go, ah, Bill Burr  who? 
[00:09:30]  Exactly.  That's why these message boards have got to eat their own, because there are people on  these message boards and on these fan sites that ruin it for everybody else, they really  do.  I just love that saying, eat their own.  Eat their own.  We eat our own all the time.  What happened on, I don't read the message boards, so what happened?  People just, you know, start saying to Jimmy, Jimmy who?  I guess they don't need Jimmy.  You know, these are the same people that just give him accolades while, when he was here  and, and then, you know, Bill did a great job for us. 
[00:10:00]  He comes in and instead of just accepting that Bill's a different person, he did a great  job sitting in for Jimmy.  They're like, fuck Jimmy.  Who needs Jimmy Norton?  And little, little Jimmy, he's a fucking lunatic as it is.  Come on.  He goes a little shallow.  He doesn't, he doesn't need that.  He takes that shit and just swallows it and it festers inside of him.  That poor little scallop is he.  I know.  Little scallop.  So there could have been, there could have been phone calls and emails all weekend long. 
[00:10:30]  There could have been.  Oh, man.  That I might just happen to have.  No.  Son of a bitch.  Just saying.  There might be one or two.  You know he's going to jump out of his new million dollar apartment and splat on the  sidewalk.  It's just going to be a cliche of some guy in Hollywood killing himself.  Like it hasn't been done a million times before.  Some up and coming guy.  They'll have listed his credits, you know.  The show fails.  Billy replaces him. 
[00:11:00]  And then Billy says, dude, why don't you come in tomorrow?  That's when he gets a tranny's AIDS penis and rubs it on Billy's cheek.  I got one email from him.  It was Sunday morning, 6.44 a.m. Eastern.  So what is that?  That's got to be 9.44 L.A. time?  No, you go the other way.  It was 3.44. 
[00:11:30]  Probably about 3.  Yeah, about 3.  3.44.  And he's sitting there typing an email about how despicable the message board people are  and his insecurities that just pop out of him.  I felt so bad.  I just wrote him.  The first thing I wrote, the first line was, you're drinking again, aren't you?  Oh, Jesus.  You started drinking again because only a drunk would react like this.  Yeah, you can't read the message.  To these morons. 
[00:12:00]  You either don't read them, or if you read them, you've got to have the thick skin they call them.  No, no, no, no.  There's no if you read them.  You don't read them.  Why would you read them?  I don't even read my message board.  You know what it is?  It's my message board.  There's a couple of people on the message board that are cool and fun.  Right.  So for a few seconds, you're having fun.  Yeah.  I'll give an example.  Last night, I'm on the message board, and I'm having some fun taking some old pictures 
[00:12:30]  from home movies that I had from when I was like seven and wearing the gayest shirt ever.  And I post that in the Photoshop section so they can tool on it or something like that.  So one guy takes my face and puts it in a fur coat.  It was funny because I used to, you know, my mother bought me a goddamn fur coat back  then because Joe Namath had one, and he looked cool on the sidelines of the Jet Games.  I looked like a fag that was being beat up in a fur coat at school.  Thanks, Mom.  So I posted another picture of me and my brother in these little suits that I swear looked like 
[00:13:00]  young Vito Corleone stepping off the boat.  They're little Italian-like suits with the hat like a derby or something.  A big fat knot in the tie.  It was a big, yeah, black knot.  With the collar that comes down here.  Dude, it was horrible.  It was horrible.  So I wrote on there.  I go, here's another one.  I go, Jesus, I don't know why I still talk to my mother after this.  And then someone's like, maybe because she's a MILF. 
[00:13:30]  Yeah, hot load in her face.  And I'm like, you know, I go, why did this get started?  I was having fun.  See how it worked?  I was having fun.  And then some guy has to just fuck it up for everybody.  Everyone's having a good time.  Why does it have to go to mom getting loads in the face?  Because they don't know how.  You understand, it's some guy who listens to the show, hears you tool on each other, fuck  around, but they don't know there's like a little middle ground.  There is a line there.  There is a line between your mother getting a load on her face.  Right. 
[00:14:00]  And a cute fur coat that you got to do when you were 12.  But there are motherfucking assholes.  And it's called being a pay.  There are assholes out there that just, and I'm not just talking radio.  Don't say, oh, you can't take it because you're on the radio.  This is every fucking workplace out there.  There's the guy that just doesn't see a line, doesn't know where it is, inappropriate fucking  idiot that no one likes, that just doesn't know.  Everyone's having a good time.  It's the guy that wrecks the good time.  So after that, I was just like, all right, good night. 
[00:14:30]  I log off.  And you had a ton of photos to post.  Right.  I was going through an old home movie, and he was Rune the fucking fun guy.  That's why these guys have got to eat their own.  Eat your own.  Eat your own.  I actually have to, I mean, I kind of do that a lot.  Just in our circle, not as a fan, but I step on the line.  What do you mean?  Yeah, but you're with the comics you've been talking about.  There is no fucking line.  You're right.  Dude, Colin Quink, his wife had a miscarriage. 
[00:15:00]  And he came outside.  And he told me inside.  And I was like, hey, man, that's very, I'm sorry, blah, blah, blah.  We talked.  And I was consoling him.  And then we were outside around two hours later.  And he comes up.  He's like, yeah, dude.  She had a miscarriage.  And I went, yeah, I know.  You told me.  You know, it doesn't matter how many times someone tells you that.  You got to just go, oh, I know.  Dude, I'm sorry.  Yeah, I know.  But I was just kidding around.  Yeah, I know.  You told me.  I did that between Patrice.  I lost my keys earlier.  Yeah, you told me. 
[00:15:30]  But I was kidding.  But I don't know how to fucking sometimes I take it a little too far.  I did that with Patrice one night, too.  He was calling me fatso.  And I said, yeah, you're so fat you have diabetes.  I hope you eat a candy bar and die.  And he was like, well, Bobby, you may want to take that shit down.  You are too far, guys.  I can't sometimes.  But I'm learning how to not take it too far.  You can't ruin it.  Could it teach me someday?  No.  Everyone's having fun.  You need to take it too far.  A good time and then just crash.  But anyway, Jimmy's doing just fine in Hollywood for his true fans that want to know. 
[00:16:00]  Let's give it up to Jimmy.  Cockroach infested apartment or whatever he is.  The one with the flies now.  It's the flies.  I think they filmed three episodes of the HBO series that he's working on.  He's going to be on Jay Leno a week from today, I believe.  Is he doing comedy or is he sitting down?  Comedy.  And then a week from tomorrow, he'll be back on the show for a few days.  And then he goes back out.  I love when he sits on the couch.  On the couch?  Because they have to push that little thing out for his feetsies.  His foot on the foot thing? 
[00:16:30]  If they do that and he still has that foot thing on his foot.  Oh, what are they going to do?  No, he will not go on the Tonight Show.  He will not go on the Tonight Show with that boot.  Oh, he absolutely would.  With that big booty.  Psychotic.  I have a triple E foot.  I don't know if you know what that means, people.  No, we're all dumb, Jimmy.  Well, Jimmy, what's wrong with your foot over there?  You got something on your foot?  The foot thing on my foot, Jay.  The foot thing on my foot.  How hysterical would that be?  I bet you he does that just so he can talk about it, Jay.  Just so he can talk about it? 
[00:17:00]  Yeah.  Well, he's got a big foot thing on his foot.  Well, I got a foot thing.  A foot thing.  Oh, poor Jimmy.  I feel bad for Jimmy.  He's out there in L.A.  He's lonely.  Yeah, he's doing a shit.  You know, I feel bad for him, seriously, because he's making all this money.  He's doing an HBO show.  You know, they're paying for everything.  He does comedy for a living.  You know what?  Maybe give a little grateful to God, you son of a bitch.  Selfish bastard.  Poor Billy does his show for a week and a half. 
[00:17:30]  You know, you're coming back.  Don't worry about it.  Yeah.  He's just a little, you know.  He's a little insecure, that's all.  He needs a hug.  He was a little sad.  He was a little sad.  You got to give him a hug when he comes back.  We should all hug him.  Give him a group hug.  Little Jimmy.  He's got to pay for it.  You know, he gets hookers.  So, to make him feel better about himself.  But the hookers he gets, how do they make you feel better about yourself?  I don't know.  His self-esteem is in the shitter.  It just always is.  I don't understand.  The guy does well. 
[00:18:00]  People like him.  He's got an amazing career.  He's got an amazing career.  He's got an unbelievable career, right.  And he's still not happy.  Yeah, he's out in Hollywood filming.  The biggest thing you could be in right now is an HBO series.  HBO.  It is all these fucking HBO.  All the HBO series.  They're taking off these things.  We almost had A&E ourselves.  A&E.  A&E.  Hey, there you go.  Jesus, wait a minute.  But HBO.  Those are the wrong letters.  Yeah, believe me.  A&E. 
[00:18:30]  HBO.  That's what you want.  HBO.  HBO.  They're taking off.  People are sick of the network shows.  They blow ass.  These things are realistic.  They're the language.  And he's part of that.  He's also part of this radio show.  Right.  How many other people?  He could trot off and leave for weeks on end, and they give him a raise.  That's how good Jimmy's life is.  He gave him a huge raise.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  But he's so self-loathing.  Right.  He's so self-hating that he reads a message board.  He can't look at the big picture of his life. 
[00:19:00]  That huge picture of his life.  I think that's the problem.  He's got to take that little shit motherfucker.  No, Anthony, I think he is looking at the big picture.  Is he?  Yeah, it's called the mirror.  We can't have everything.  Brad Pitt's got the career, and he can look in the mirror, but I'm sure there's something  haunting him.  What is it?  Little dick?  What has he got?  There's something pissing him off.  He actually has fucked up feet.  Is that it?  He's got a foot thing.  A foot on a foot?  He's actually got a huge hog. 
[00:19:30]  Does he?  Yeah, they got a picture of that.  What?  Son of a bitch.  How do you know what?  Dude, it was in one of the fucking rag magazines.  I've never heard that.  They freaking got a picture of his hog.  No justice in this world.  Where is that?  I'd love to see that.  That goes back years.  I mean, not for a fag reason, just for, you know.  That goes back years.  But I've always wanted his abs, but I could probably switch over to his hog now.  Speaking of hogs, Anthony was checking out hogs on TV last night.  Well, again, HBO, I don't know how many hogs are going to be on the show Jimmy's on HBO, but HBO seems to enjoy the gratuitous sex on their TV series. 
[00:20:00]  Remember Oz?  Of course.  I remember watching Oz, and it was a show about a prison, and very entertaining, but as it went on, every episode, there was more man-ass and man-dick and man-on-man sex going on on that show.  So, it just got unbearable.  So, I'm watching this show now on HBO.  Very good show. 
[00:20:30]  It's called Rome.  It's about Caesar and Rome.  That's a great HBO series.  Been watching it.  You know, you got the legions and the battles and shit like that, and that's cool.  And then they have sex with the women or the slaves or something, and you get a lot of nice tits and ass in the show.  Wonderful.  Well, last night, they decide it's time for a woman to give another woman this gift of this man.  And they start this slow pan from the guy's feet past his knees. 
[00:21:00]  There's his thighs.  And I'm like, I turn to my cheek and I go, uh-oh, because I know it's HBO.  What did your girl say?  She was like, ooh.  Here it comes.  You hear a slight moan from the couch.  When they get...  That's not what you want to hear.  Dude.  And it's me.  When they get to the middle of his thighs...  You have a togeron?  Oh, ooh.  Centurion.  They get to the middle of his thighs.  You see the head of his dick.  Yeah.  At the middle of his thigh. 
[00:21:30]  And they pan up.  This guy...  Is that his quadricep?  You mean his...  The hugest cock!  You mean his quads or his thigh?  His thigh!  I thought his thigh is up here, right?  No, well...  The front of your thigh.  The front of your thigh.  I'm talking the whole thing.  Hey, where do you think the thigh is?  I didn't know.  I thought the thigh is...  The back of the thigh of the front.  The thigh starts down here.  You didn't have it wrapped around his leg like a snake.  All right, you guys don't have to turn into a fucking mafia.  Hey, where do you think the thigh is?  Bill Burr would have known exactly what the fuck I was talking about.  Well, you know what?  Bill, you get smart.  Me, you get dumb and creepy stories. 
[00:22:00]  Bill never fucked the sink.  Go ahead.  It was the...  I miss Bill Burr!  I'm sorry.  Let me type on the message board.  This guy sucks.  Bob is not as good as Bill.  Bring back Bill.  Bill would have said something witty and put a big word in it.  Look, I gave it 17 minutes.  He's no Bill Burr.  Fucking asshole.  This guy doesn't know where his thigh is.  So they pan up and just huge hog.  And now I'm sitting there going, 
[00:22:30]  are we going to have to deal with this now like we did with Oz?  Because Oz was a good show, but it just turned into gay porno.  What kind of hog was it?  It was a giant hog.  This guy's cocked.  I was thinking about the casting call for this thing.  How do you cast that?  HBO series.  Oh, that's good.  Wanted.  Guy with huge cock.  Because that's all he did.  He didn't speak a line.  He stood there in the background as this woman was doing a dialogue. 
[00:23:00]  Then they give him as the gift.  And again, close up on his cock, the camera pulls away.  He's standing there with his dick.  Not one word uttered.  So the audition had to be like that scene out of Hardcore.  All right, pull your pants down.  Let me see your cock.  All right, big cock.  You're in.  You're in.  You know, I know this guy.  A little casting ladies were like, I know this guy.  Let me tell you.  Let me call.  I'll make a few phone calls.  The grip over on.  That's right.  There's some dude that works at the studio. 
[00:23:30]  Over on Will and Grace, the grip.  Oh, my God.  I think he's either a grip right now or a best boy.  You want to be in the pictures?  It's huge.  You want to be in pictures?  You want circumcised or uncircumcised?  Yeah, man.  They showed that shit for like two scenes and for quite a while.  Just cock sitting there for multiple minutes.  What's this Rome about?  From Point Pleasant.  What's that?  What's this Rome about?  Rome.  I thought it was getting good reviews.  It is.  It's good.  What's this Rome about?  Rome.  It's about Rome.  When Caesar was, you know, Caesar was in charge there and it's about him. 
[00:24:00]  The Caesar, Julius Caesar.  Oh, Julius?  Yeah, yeah, that's Caesar.  The one that gets killed by all his buddies there.  Yeah.  It's a great show.  Really good.  A lot of violence.  A lot of sex.  Last night, I think there were like three fuck scenes in it.  A lot of tit.  And then, you know, you got to deal with the fucking cock.  Do they have orgies and stuff like that?  Yeah.  They do?  They got all that stuff?  They got shit like that.  A lot of fucking. 
[00:24:30]  A lot of fucking in that show.  A lot of naked women?  Yeah, naked broads.  Naked slave girls.  Naked women.  The wives of the, you know, the army comes back and, you know, they got to take their  armor off and fuck their wives, you know, and they show it.  But all those guys back then, though, they were all kind of fags back then.  Being gay wasn't being gay like it is now, like really queer.  Back then.  Men were oysters.  Back then it was all right.  Yeah, you get a little boy, he gives you a back rub on his pool, you know, you get a  little... 
[00:25:00]  Well, that seems to be what Alexander, the movie Alexander, was watching that a couple  of weeks ago or a week ago, and that was just like gay porno.  Yeah.  It's just these guys, you know, and they're in love with each other.  Yeah.  They bed down each other, and then they go into battle, and they're like fucking each  other up with swords and, you know, bashing each other's heads together with the helmets.  That's what I mean, back over there.  Well, they're in bed too, I guess.  I met this guy from Egypt who used to work at the comedy cell, and he told me, he goes,  listen, he goes, you, you faggot?  I go, no, mom, I'm not a faggot. 
[00:25:30]  And he goes, you know what we do to you in my country?  We throw rocks at you until you feel better.  Oh.  And then if that don't work, we fuck you in the ass.  Because you're a faggot.  Because you're a faggot.  I'm not.  Yeah, they got something going on there.  Why did he think you were a faggot?  Oh, I don't know, Opie.  I'm not talking in my mouth at this time.  I don't know.  I don't know why he thought I was a faggot.  All those guys.  You know, I'm telling you, I was talking to the soldiers over in Iraq when I was over 
[00:26:00]  there, and they say when they're driving out in the Humvees in the middle of the desert,  these guys would just go out in the middle of the desert, pull the car over and just start  plowing away.  And when you drive by, it's not even like they pull their pants up.  They'll just wave with a smile.  With girls?  No, with guys.  With boys.  With boys.  I don't know how old they are.  I've heard about that.  There's something going on there.  Guys on guy over there, because they treat their women, women are so, you know, fuck  you, bitch, stay down.  That it's better to just have sex with another guy than it is that poor dog. 
[00:26:30]  They're with each other in war, or they're in a foxhole, like Saddam had them out there  for years.  They just say, you know what, fuck it.  Take your hairy brown ass out.  I know.  That is disgusting.  Well, that's probably what it was.  I'm just, I was just trying to, you know, it is radio.  Now I have to.  That's for the visual.  We really appreciate it, as we try to drink our coffee.  One thing interesting, last night watching Roman, one of the warriors had his wife there, 
[00:27:00]  and he placed his testicles on her eyes and his cock down the nose, and he just called  it a war helmet.  Oh, you had me for a second, you son of a bitch.  Dude, your phone stinks.  That's where my phone is.  Oh, no, he's trying to show us that this morning, like, look at the latest technology.  No, but you see, he wants to bring it to the attention of the radio show.  No, I take from it.  We brought it to the attention of the gang in the office.  We hated it.  No, wait a minute.  Opie, Opie, you hated it.  Hello, the action, so you see what he did?  He picked up his phone like, uh, uh, uh, want to brag about my new phone? 
[00:27:30]  Yeah.  Listen.  Dude, that is a thick phone.  This is, yeah, because it's also a computer.  You get internet, you get fucking, uh, all my emails, text messaging.  You get real internet or WAP internet on that?  No, you get the EVDO, the new Sprint internet.  Ah, the new Sprint.  Which is broadband, baby.  So how many actual websites can you go to, and how many, say, not formatted for this?  I can go to all of them.  You can go to all of them.  I can go to Opie and Anthony right now if I wanted to.  Oh, yeah?  Honest to fucking God.  Well, you should be able to. 
[00:28:00]  You got a fucking desktop with an antenna on it.  Jesus.  That is a big phone.  It's too big, Bob.  It's too big?  It's too big.  It is a little too big.  Something happened with the phones.  They were trying to get it as small as possible, and now we're going the other way with the phones.  Now we're like...  Can't figure it out.  Now we're going to go a little bigger to get more stuff to do.  Yeah, but this phone is, I don't have to take anything with me on the road.  It's all my emails, all my text messages, little keyboard.  I got Word on here.  I got everything on here.  I've seen ones with keyboards. 
[00:28:30]  And it has my MP3, all my songs on here.  So I use it as my iPod now.  How does it work as a phone?  Unbelievable.  I don't know.  I can't get a call.  Unbelievable.  And it goes landscape mode and switches back when you shut it.  Very nice.  It's called landscape mode?  That's what they call it in the old PPC 6700 book.  It's very big.  See, the phones, there's a problem because the technology got very advanced of what they  could put in the phone, but the screens now.  There's too much shit going on where you can't see in the little screen, so they've got to 
[00:29:00]  make the screen bigger.  Well, they've got a new phone coming out that actually, you know the Razer phone?  Yeah, yeah.  The same thing as the Trio, except as thin as the Razer.  It's coming out very soon.  It's too fat, though.  It's not too fat.  This is the problem with you guys.  I'm not talking about your phone.  I'm talking about you.  Can I just say something, though?  Honestly, you said that.  You've lost some weight, I think.  No, I'll tell you what happened.  Me get, every morning, I get up around 1130, okay, 12 o'clock, 11, 12.  I wake up.  I have probably two sips, two and a half sips, two sips of coffee. 
[00:29:30]  I immediately have to drop a deuce.  I hope you'll do that.  I take one haul of a cigarette.  I take two sips, two and a half sips, and I go, oh, my God.  I run into the bathroom.  I have to tell my girlfriend, beat it, because she can be in there while I'm deucing, but  she can't be in there at the beginning, at the end.  Wait, wait.  What?  Hold the phone.  Why?  If I'm dropping a deuce, she can come in while you're in the middle of it, but not at the  beginning.  She can't get the first grunt and the last wipe. 
[00:30:00]  I just feel uncomfortable.  No.  She can't get the pinch off.  No, no, no.  You can't get me going like this, and then picking my butt up a little bit and checking.  Dude, the girl.  That's why your relationship's a disaster.  Right.  The girl can't be in the same part of the house.  We learned years ago.  No way.  House.  We learned years ago that you should have separate bathrooms if you want a healthy relationship.  I'd love to do that.  And if you can't have separate bathrooms, at least do your stuff separately. 
[00:30:30]  Yeah, wait.  You can't have her brushing her teeth while you're taking a dog.  No, no, no.  Let's not get carried away.  Well, what is she doing in the bathroom while you're doing?  Well, she wasn't in there flossing.  Well, what is she doing while you're dropping?  Well, no.  I'm saying, like, I'll kick her out.  She'll be in there doing her makeup, and I'll be like, get the fuck out.  If she wants to come back in, grab something and take off.  It's not like she comes in there.  No.  What?  There is no girl in there.  It's a disaster.  Before?  Let me put it this way.  I've never seen her, ever.  Yeah.  I don't even.  Never. 
[00:31:00]  Well, she knows not to.  Except one time, and this fucked me up, and it still fucks me up.  This really messed me up.  I'm sorry for swearing on the show.  I know it's XM, but I'm trying to change my ways.  Bill curses sometimes.  We like when Bill curses.  I know, because he puts it in the right place.  Right.  That's right.  I just cursed to say, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.  Fucking.  I fucking was fucking going to the fucking.  Like, this really messed me up with my girl.  One time, this happened, I don't know, a few months ago. 
[00:31:30]  She went in the bathroom.  She left.  And then I went in there, and there was a little.  A little fragrance.  There was a little douche.  A little douche stain.  A little remnants.  A little skid mark on the bottom of the toilet.  And I've never, out of all the years I've known her, have I ever even, even a hint, a smell that she goes number two.  Ever.  And then I went in there, and I saw her.  I knew it wasn't me.  I knew it wasn't me, because that morning came out like albino color.  And I was like, oh.  I was like, come on, honey. 
[00:32:00]  Keep your shit together.  When she came on that night, I go, honey, keep your shit together.  You got to check.  Make sure.  I don't want to ever know about that shit.  Keep it tight.  But you're sitting there, dropping.  Look at me.  While she's walking in and out.  Look at me.  Yeah.  Well, you shouldn't give her any more ammunition to go, this guy's a disgusting mess.  Not sitting on the toilet.  During and after, there is no way.  You got it.  You got it.  There have been times I've opened the window.  You can open, just shaking his head.  And taken the towel.  That's right.  And like, with the towel trying to circulate the air out of the bathroom. 
[00:32:30]  I shit my pants next to my girlfriend.  You belong in Willowbrook Mental Institution.  With her.  Actually, now, good.  Okay.  Actually, really good now.  Yeah.  Because last time we asked, it was pretty awful.  Actually, Jesus Christ.  I don't know if the word was awful we used.  Awful?  I think that's the word you added in your own brain as we were talking about it.  Well, after you told the story, I was thinking disaster, quite frankly.  I, uh, yeah.  Actually, it's actually really good now. 
[00:33:00]  All right.  Is it?  I love when somebody's real thoughts come out by accident.  I love that.  Especially with Opie.  It's never by accident.  We're almost down the road.  It's never by accident with me.  Hey, how's your mother's face doing?  What do you mean, my mother's face?  Oh, shit.  I thought that in my own head.  I apologize.  When I met her, I saw her face.  I thought there was something wrong with it.  I've never met your mother.  You could come up with a better example than that.  I've met your girlfriend.  Yes, I have.  She seems very, very nice. 
[00:33:30]  Yeah, she is very nice.  I said it, I believe, after the fact, but I just want to say it again.  Robert Kelly warmed up for Dane Cook when Dane did his Madison Square Garden stuff in front of 5,000 people.  And Robert Kelly absolutely killed.  Yeah.  Killed in front of everybody.  Yeah, that was a great time.  That was a good time.  You know what was weird, though?  There was a lot of ONA fans there, and nobody yelled anything out at me.  Really?  Yeah, and I just did the Stress Factory, a lot of ONA, which I've got to thank, too, you guys.  Probably out of fear, because we heard that one tape of you losing your fucking mind on that one guy. 
[00:34:00]  I don't want to be that guy.  But usually they yell, you know, you kind of look forward to getting something yelled out, you know what I mean?  Nothing.  At the Stress Factory, the last show Saturday night, there was like, you know, a bunch of creeps yelling shit out.  Broke my fucking knee, man.  Yeah, broke my knee, man, and all that shit.  Well, it's a fine line with you guys.  Some of you guys want stuff yelled at, yelled out, and others don't.  Well, at the beginning, it's fine.  I mean, during the show, though, in the middle of the bit, you know, that always sucks ass.  You're right at the punchline, and someone yells out, you know, not you, and you're like, 
[00:34:30]  I have to tip it, and you're fucking, you're kind of, you know what I mean?  I actually had a spider come down off that, in the middle of my act, in the middle of a bit.  Well, somebody brought that up.  Oh, that's a real story?  Yeah, Arthur, line three, I guess, was at the show.  I thought this was one of your bits.  This actually happened?  This happened.  Skip the shit out of me.  Arthur.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Hey, so, this is kind of a funny story, but I'm going to let Robert Kelly tell it, because,  you know, he's the funny guy.  Thanks for putting all the pressure on me, you ass. 
[00:35:00]  Wait, but tell us what you saw.  Oh, well, so I'm going to the Stress Factory Saturday, and I look forward to a good show.  I've walked past Robert Kelly in the garage.  Let him be, right?  I figure, ah, he's getting ready, I'll let him be.  Get into the show.  First guy sucked.  I don't even remember who it was.  I guess five, ten minutes into his set, this fucking spider starts coming down in front  of him.  Everybody's laughing and pointing.  It took him about 25, 30 seconds to see it.  He just starts freaking out.  It was, I couldn't breathe.  The whole place was... 
[00:35:30]  You lose it on a spider.  You got to understand, I'm in the middle of the bit.  All right, let me take over now.  Jesus Christ.  Hit 25, 30 seconds.  Great storyteller.  Yeah, he was good.  You folks fell on your face.  You get an F minus in my book.  Who was that?  That was that, the ball guy?  Oh, boy.  Yeah, exactly.  Where's Bill?  He'd have known exactly who that was.  Call Bill, he'll know.  I'm about to strangle you out of your own consciousness. 
[00:36:00]  All right, go ahead.  Are you doing your act?  I like the new little buttons you got.  Spider?  Yeah, I'm doing my act, but I'm in the middle of the bit, and people are laughing way too  hard at this bit.  Oh, no.  Because you know where people are supposed to laugh, how hard they're supposed to laugh.  And in my head, I'm like, wait a minute.  Is my fly down?  Because sometimes I actually have my pay you pop out on, sometimes I don't wear underwear.  No way.  Yeah, sometimes I don't wear underwear, because I'm a little heavy.  What does that have to do with anything?  If I wear underwear, my elastic on the underwear flaps down. 
[00:36:30]  You understand what I'm saying?  Flaps down.  No.  You stretch out your underwear to the point you can't wear them anymore?  No.  Do you know the elastic on the underwear?  Yeah.  That's made to stretch out to 100 inches.  No, it stretches out.  But what happens is, it hits the top of your stomach, and it flaps over.  And it goes flop.  Flop.  You can actually hear it go flat, though.  And then what's the problem with that being flapped over?  I don't know.  You just feel it go flap. 
[00:37:00]  Oh, really?  And you go, ugh.  And you have to keep shipping it up like a girdle during the whole show, so you don't feel  fucking insecure, so you can keep going with the show.  Right.  So sometimes I don't wear underwear, and I've had my pay you pop out, because my zipper will  come down.  Yeah.  And so I'm thinking that these cocks are, you know, my penis is out.  I got something on my cheek.  And I also had a zit in the middle of my forehead.  I think that let go or something.  I look like an Indian.  I look like an Indian.  Something happened.  Making fun of it.  I open my eyes.  I'm like, ugh.  All of a sudden, I see this shiny little glimmer of the web, and this spider, this huge spider 
[00:37:30]  coming down off the...  I fucking hate spiders.  Yeah, they are creepy.  I don't like spiders.  They are worse.  I don't like that they have more than four legs.  I don't like the fact that they have some type of fang.  They have, like, a weird eyeball.  I don't like...  You don't know if they're going to bite you.  They got a web.  They can shoot shit out of their assholes and come down off of anything.  And then when you... 
[00:38:00]  I didn't know what to do, so I just got an Indian.  I grabbed the web.  Oh, that's...  But as you grab the web...  Now they start climbing up.  It starts going up, but I got the web, and I'm like, ah!  That's because they think they got something.  Now you got to get rid of it before...  Now it's a timed event.  Now it's a game show.  You got to get rid of it before he gets up to your hands.  The spider got all excited.  He was ready to have a pig roast with all his...  With his little spider family.  Sorry.  He's like, you got to have a pig in.  See how stuff in his brain just comes home?  It doesn't matter. 
[00:38:30]  That's what happens.  Call me a pig roast.  You just call...  Hey, we got Don Ho on the line here.  The spider thought he got something, and, you know, a pig, and...  Couldn't it be a ham sandwich?  Did it have to be the whole pig open?  Does it have to be a fucking luau?  Well, actually, yes, it has to.  Did you kill it?  Well, that's the thing, is I went...  I put it on the ground, and it was...  How big was this dumb spider?  A foot.  That was a foot on a foot. 
[00:39:00]  Was it a big one, really?  It wasn't as big as a camel spider.  Was it as big as the last knuckle of your thumb, let's say?  I say it was like this big.  That big?  With the legs?  With the legs.  With the legs almost as big as a golf ball?  I would say yes.  All right.  Kind of scary.  And people at the show are probably going to say I'm lying,  but what the fuck do they know before they call?  They both looked at the screen.  Nobody's calling.  Now I'm looking.  You're not Bill Burr.  Listen. 
[00:39:30]  Hurry up with your cute story.  Jesus.  Jesus Christ, help me.  Wow.  Really set you up to throw you under the...  He would never do that to Bill.  No, he wouldn't.  Of course not.  He'd be like, Bill, keep talking.  Of course not.  I really love you.  You've got the same face as me.  I don't like Bob.  He looks...  He has a goatee like Ant.  Billy looks like an Aryan nation, just like me.  No, that is true.  We'll just go on vacation one day and have the two of them sit in for us.  They're both Aryans.  They're going to get nice tattoos on their arms.  Wow, Ant, you gained a lot of weight. 
[00:40:00]  Oh.  And so the spider...  You fuck you.  No.  It ain't happening.  You just had like 50 seconds to get a bunch more fat jokes in your head.  Bodily harm comes to the little guy.  So the spider...  I can't make the spider noise like you, but you did it well.  Yeah, that's pretty good.  So now it's coming back up toward your hand and you're holding it.  I dropped it on the ground.  I went to kill it.  Some lady stands up out of nowhere. 
[00:40:30]  No!  I'm like, what?  She goes, it's bad luck.  Oh, is that it?  And I'm like, oh, fuck me.  You know, I don't believe in that, but what if she's right?  My career stinks as it is.  Yeah, you don't need bad luck.  Yeah, so I just took some fucking dude's flip-flop off and the flip-flops on.  And I took it off in the front row.  His flip-flop?  Yeah, flip-flop.  I hate that name.  And you hit him with it?  Well, I had him do it.  I wasn't going to kill it.  Oh, he killed it? 
[00:41:00]  He killed it.  I would have flung it into the front row.  Yeah, that's a good one.  He's such an evil...  I can't even fuck with it.  I'm a pussy.  I don't like that shit.  All right, let's say hi to Mike and get the real stuff.  That guy that killed it for you, though, he just, in some feedback, he won lotto that  night.  He bought a scratch ticket.  And he got blown by Angelina Jolie by accident in a car crash.  Mike, what's up?  Yo, hey, how's it going, guys?  Hey.  I was at the show, he was crying like a fucking baby.  As soon as he whacked that spider, I swear I heard the spider yell, 
[00:41:30]  Oh, my leg, man.  He broke my fucking leg.  He hung up on himself.  Oh, where's Ben?  I got to tell a quick story from Friday, which was really bizarre.  It's Ben.  Here comes Ben.  Ben all happy about the Red Sox.  Oh, God bless Red Sox.  Making it in.  Oh, God bless the Red Sox.  Yankees in, Red Sox in, obviously.  Yeah.  Astros in.  Yeah.  I'm glad the Astros are in, too.  Fuck, you know that Clemens went 13-8, 
[00:42:00]  and if he got some run support,  that guy would have won probably 20 games this year.  Clemens is unbelievable.  I'm going for the Astros in the NL just because of Clemens.  Clemens is the best pitcher of all time,  and we're actually getting to see it.  Yeah.  The best pitcher of all time.  And Barry Bonds, the greatest hitter of all time.  We get.  Ugh.  I hope he breaks his leg in the offseason.  You know like Barry Bonds?  He's got six homers to go to beat Ruth.  Asshole.  He just seems like he's a dick.  Looks like Earl. 
[00:42:30]  He really does look like Earl.  So we took the boys out for hamburgers after the show Friday.  Oh, we did, didn't we?  We had a good time, right?  Thumbs up to the boys.  We had a good time.  Over there at the parker, they make a great burger over there.  They got a little hole-in-the-wall burger joint behind a curtain.  I'm on the sidewalk outside the building with Ben.  Who was out there?  Ben?  Your father?  Yeah.  And your woman.  And who else?  Just standing there.  It was just the four of us.  We're just talking, you know?  With your father in town to buy a block of New York City? 
[00:43:00]  His father's loaded?  If you're in Boston, he owns where you're standing.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  Is that why you can just dress any way you want?  And I only mean that with the utmost respect.  That's right.  I love you, Ben.  I love you.  The guy's a power broker up there.  I love the guy.  So, yeah, we were standing there just shooting the shit.  Hope was talking about some family stuff that was going on with him.  And then all of a sudden...  Oh, no.  I mean, I bought a restaurant with my brothers in Huntington. 
[00:43:30]  Mickey D's?  It's going to be a good place.  My brother Brett's going to run the whole thing.  You're a restaurateur.  You bought a restaurant?  I'm a silent partner.  That's what they say.  I'm a silent partner.  Do you go into the kitchen?  Do you get in the kitchen and go, what is this?  This is crap.  Shut it down.  You don't pull all that crap?  Like the big boss?  I finally bought something.  Why do you have an English accent?  Because that was the cooking show.  Oh, that guy, yeah.  Yeah, that angry guy.  So, yeah, so we got a restaurant in Huntington. 
[00:44:00]  Hi.  Yeah, information?  Yeah.  Uh, Burr?  Bill?  Yeah.  No, just connect me directly.  Could you please?  Thanks.  You don't think Bill's putting on his sneakers right now?  You guys told him on Friday, listen,  just listen to the first 15 minutes.  He's right now, I got to go, honey.  I got to go.  The boys, you just push the button  and there's like a bat symbol in the air.  It's a Burr symbol.  Just like the Jets,  we're playing with our third-string quarterback. 
[00:44:30]  Actually, Joe Namath is playing next week for you guys.  We're going to have some football talk in a little while.  Time for his knees to heal?  Actually, guaranteed a Super Bowl win.  Actually, the Jets lost 13-3 to Baltimore,  and we had absolutely no quarterback.  The announcers, by the third quarter,  were begging Herm Edwards,  going, could you please put Vinny Testaverde in there  so the team has a chance to win?  Yeah.  The guy was awful.  Why didn't he put him in?  40 total yards in the first half. 
[00:45:00]  Vinny don't know the plays yet.  Fucking like two or three first downs.  He's been throwing the ball around for,  he said, a couple of times a week.  That was it.  Yeah, but just throw him in, dude.  It's football.  You go that way, right on his chest.  You just throw him in.  You know what happens?  He's injured,  and now you're stuck with that clown the whole year.  A week earlier,  he was throwing a nerf to his son in the backyard.  Yeah.  That was pretty much what he was doing.  He was throwing like twice a week with his son.  That was it.  And now all of a sudden,  he's 41 on the sidelines,  and he's going to come into the game. 
[00:45:30]  He's playing Madden on PlayStation.  His thumbs are all worked out.  He's just got to get the rest of his body up the bar.  He goes into the house and starts drawing on the ground.  They're like,  no, dude, listen.  Look on your wrist.  They're on your wrist.  The Jets could have won that game yesterday.  Their defense was amazing,  and we had absolutely no quarterback.  No quarterback.  It was so frustrating.  What's the record?  What are we, 2-2 now?  2-2?  It's not bad.  Yeah, 2-2.  It's not bad.  The whole division's easy.  Little Alex Kittner from Wack Bag, 
[00:46:00]  Jesus Christ, Opie.  You go from buying a dresser to a restaurant,  skipped right over the whole bed frame and desk stage.  That's true.  You went, well, not buying anything.  He lives in an empty apartment.  He had company over one day.  They didn't have any place to sit,  and thank God you didn't have any snacks for them  because there was no table to put it on.  But now he's got a restaurant.  Now he's got a restaurant.  The Jets are one and three, by the way.  One and three?  I don't know what I was thinking.  But, yeah, well, we've got a restaurant.  My brother will run out.  Well, congratulations.  What kind of food is it?  My brother's been in the business for like, 
[00:46:30]  I don't know, off and on for like 20,  not off and on.  He's been in it for like 20 years.  He knows what he's doing.  What kind is it?  It's up to him.  I think we're going to do a little.  You don't even know what type of food it is?  I think we'll do an American thing.  American cuisine.  Is that what you're going to do?  He's going to go in there one day.  Yeah, let me get a hamburger.  Listen, if we don't have hamburgers.  I'll have more details.  It's a fish restaurant.  We have fish.  Just fish.  Anyway, so I'm out on the sidewalk with Ben.  Oh, Babu. 
[00:47:00]  Ben and his father and getting restaurant advice  because the guy knows the business, you know,  and we're just having some small talk.  I haven't seen Ben's father in a while.  And all of a sudden this, what was it, a BMW?  A BMW is driving east on 57th Street.  And stops right in front of the building, you know,  and starts yelling at me.  He goes, hey, Greg, you suck.  I'm like, hey, yeah, whatever.  And I wave.  He goes, no, Greg, you suck.  I'm like, yeah, what's up, dude?  Hey, you suck, whatever.  And then all of a sudden he goes, we're going to kick your ass 
[00:47:30]  when we go to the other company.  I'm like, dude, who the fuck are you?  Now I'm like, who the fuck are you?  It's a black guy, right?  Black guy, you know, thinking he's real tough as he's driving by.  You know, we're going to kick your ass when we go to the other company.  I'm like, who are you?  I still have no fucking idea whatsoever.  Didn't even know who it was until the vanity plates,  because, you know, he's so big he has to tell people who he is.  I love that move.  And he's driving a Volkswagen.  So then, so I'm like, who the fuck are you? 
[00:48:00]  We're going to kick your ass when we go to the other company.  I'm like, well, who do you work for?  I don't even know who you are.  He goes, you know who I work for.  He doesn't even say Howard.  He says something.  The king or something.  The king or something ridiculous.  I'm like, so I'm like, I just keep smiling and waving like this, right?  And he's sort of angry, I guess.  I mean, his moniker is Angry Black Dude, or what's his name?  Angry Black, I guess.  Angry Black?  Yeah, that's what he said, yeah.  All right, so I'm like, yeah, whatever.  And I'm smiling like, you're not getting to me. 
[00:48:30]  You know, obviously we're getting to you if you're so outraged  that you have to yell at me while you're driving by.  And then we see the vanity plate that says Angry Black.  So I guess it's one of, you know, Howard's like one of the guys  that comes in and does the show for free.  That's kind of like, you know, Stalker Patty or Big A or somebody  seeing Howard and yelling at him that, you know,  they're going to kick his ass when he goes to satellites.  Like, yeah, whatever, dude.  And I'm sitting there like, Ben, I guess we're getting to the Howard  and the gang over there, aren't we?  Because he was losing his mind. 
[00:49:00]  But I'm like, come here, come here, come on.  He has no idea he's dealing with a ticking time bomb.  I'm like, I hope he looks like a really nice guy from like 20 feet away.  When you get up and you start fucking with him,  he's like, his eyes just go back like a great white shark.  But for someone who calls himself Angry Black,  he was the fucking biggest wimp I've ever seen in my life.  Yeah.  And that whole thing.  He's just like, you know what?  All right, come here.  Come here, you son of a bitch.  I don't know, bro.  What do you think that's going to do? 
[00:49:30]  I'm going to take my rollerblades off and beat the shit out of you.  Know what that showed me?  Know what that showed me?  What?  Because it'll get back to him and the rest of the faggots over there.  Right.  It just shows me that we're so getting under their skin.  So getting under their skin.  And we'll continue because our pests are just ridiculous.  But he's driving by and he stops the car.  I'm like, well, come on out, buddy.  He thinks he's such part of Howard's show that.  You don't even get paid.  He would probably try to tell Howie that and Howard would just like hang up on him. 
[00:50:00]  Well, he is the Angry Black.  I mean, if he went, hey, Opie, how you doing?  He'd be friendly.  Yeah, he'd be friendly, Buck.  So he had to be angry.  He was just probably in character.  And I was given that smile and the wave from JFK.  The passive aggressive.  We all did it to each other.  You know, the middle finger wave that, what was it, Pesci did?  Yeah.  No, it was, what's his name?  Clay Atron.  Atron.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Bill Burr would have known the name.  No, he wouldn't have.  And Jimmy Norton certainly would have known the name. 
[00:50:30]  Clay Atron.  What's his name?  I have to poo.  That's the thing.  I haven't pooed yet.  But I'm just smiling going, come on, come on.  And then giving him the cute little wave.  And he's just like, I guess he was sort of angry.  I mean, if you're driving around with Angry Black on the back of your car, I think you should  be a little more angry than you were.  Yeah, but that makes you even more angry when someone's passive aggressive.  Of course.  I'm talking about just, when you yell at somebody, you want them to go, well, fuck you.  So you can both kind of bark at each other. 
[00:51:00]  But when the other dog doesn't bark, he just kind of looks at you.  Yeah.  All right.  Good for you.  Bye-bye.  It's like, you know, he punched his dashboard.  He broke his, he broke his.  I guarantee he did something stupid because he didn't get to me.  Because then it was like, anyway.  And I continued talking to Ben and his father.  Like he was looking for this huge reaction.  Like, yeah, dude.  You're just showing that we're getting under your skin.  So continue.  People are wondering, did Joe Pesci bust up your brother's place and he approached you  to become partners with him? 
[00:51:30]  Is that what it is?  And Obi's sitting there going, you got no business?  Fuck you.  Pay me.  You got a fire?  Fuck you.  Pay me.  Place gets hit by lightning and World War III starts in the lounge?  Fuck you.  Pay me.  I hope he's wheeling shit out the back door selling it.  We're very excited about the restaurant.  Me and the aunt are out front in the car talking as it's lit on fire.  Smoke's coming out of the windows.  Joe Broad, in this day and age, what the fuck are you talking about?  What kind of people are they? 
[00:52:00]  So that was just a weird thing that happened Friday.  I'm like, yeah, all right, whatever, dude.  I can't believe you own a restaurant, dude.  That's crazy.  He wants to blow it off.  Look, I don't want these creeps going down there.  I'm going to go there as soon as it opens, Ope.  Yeah.  Hey, that's a great idea.  If you get something to go at Ope's restaurant, do they put it in a cement sack?  Wow, the phones are now answering themselves.  People are saying the specials are steel-cut oatmeal and blueberry. 
[00:52:30]  Steel-cut oatmeal.  I don't know what that even means.  Steel-cut.  He's eating papier-mâché with raisins.  All right, Ben's leaving.  Your pats look great, by the way.  They look good in the first half.  And I was talking football with you on the phone yesterday, and you're like, oh, Brady  threw for 300 again.  He didn't throw for 300 yesterday.  He didn't throw for 300?  224, I think.  He had a great first half.  The team's just...  How about the Giants?  The Giants finally have a fucking quarterback.  Unbelievable.  The Giants was great. 
[00:53:00]  That was the guy we were all laughing at last year, and now look at him.  Yeah, we're going to do it.  I hate the Giants, though.  And Kansas City must want to kill themselves.  Philly, they had that game won.  Philly came back and won.  Yeah, Philly came back and won.  Philly won that game?  Yeah.  Was it like 31-6 or something like that?  They were getting killed.  I gave up on the game.  It was so ridiculous.  They were getting killed, and then they came back and won.  Eagles won that game?  37-31.  Just repeating everything.  Shut up, Ben.  Don't fucking call me out.  I'm really intelligent.  37-31.  Yeah, yeah, they came back.  It was 37 or 31. 
[00:53:30]  No kidding, 31.  That was unbelievable.  All right.  You see Michael Vick?  Fucking no, what's wrong?  Michael Vick got hurt yesterday.  He tore his MCL.  Did he?  Yep.  He was on the ground, hurting.  He's out.  Can you give us some angry baby?  A lot of people are requesting that.  Nah, fucking Michael Vick, this cocksucker, tore an MCL.  He fucking went down to the ground again, this fucking million dollar fucking faggot.  That's Angry Baby, definitely. 
[00:54:00]  That wasn't Pesci.  That was Pesci.  Nah, I heard Angry Baby.  The beginning was Pesci, the end was Angry Baby.  Yeah, it had more of a baby-like tone to it.  I actually went on an audition three days after I did that on the show for a Joe Pesci thing,  and I didn't get it.  You didn't?  Because I did Angry Baby.  Okay.  You got all confused.  That's not Pesci.  That's like an angry baby.  Who got it?  Norris?  All right.  In honor of Robert Kelly sitting in for Bill Burr, who sits in for Jim Norton. 
[00:54:30]  Great.  Oh, fucking Norton.  Come on, man.  Boy, a kid's going to jump out of a window.  We love Norton.  He knows us.  We do.  The show will be Opie, Anthony, and wool Jimmy Norton.  But we're making more stars around us.  Bill Burr is definitely a star, and Robert's our friend.  Oh.  All right.  Opie, you fucking douchebag.  He's the only guy that comes up to you when he wants to give you a compliment, and it almost 
[00:55:00]  probably sickens him.  Yeah.  He walks up like at the Madison Square Garden.  Hold on.  At the end of the show, he goes like this.  It almost looked like, you know what, dude?  You fucking killed it.  Like, I didn't think you were going to even be good.  Pissed him off.  Yeah, it made him mad that I did good.  Yeah.  I got to defend myself.  I am definitely a little different when I'm not on the air, and I went right up to you  and gave you major props and was very proud of you.  Yeah, you were.  I swear to God, you're making a bit now, which is fine, but I was like, holy shit, dude, you  killed, because it was a Dane Cook audience. 
[00:55:30]  I know you warm up for Dane, but you went up there, and you fucking killed.  Yeah.  And I was happy for you.  I know.  I'm sorry.  I was just trying to make goofs on your show.  No, because I want people to know.  I mean, you're on your way yourself, obviously.  Thank you very much, Opie.  All right, with that.  I'm no Bill Burb.  Well, now we get back to the joke, but when it comes to your bread and butter, you went  up there, and you knocked it out of the park.  All right.  I'll do something. 
[00:56:00]  Let's go.  As we go to break, one of my favorite things, Bob broke his knee, and everyone did all the  remixes.  Yeah.  And this is our favorite, Robert Kelly and the whole Henry Hill remix thing.  Listen to this.  Look, he started to touch me.  He started to grab me.  I told him to stop.  He didn't stop.  I hit him back.  And then he got really angry.  He pushed me out of the car.  What do you want, fucko? 
[00:56:30]  You want something?  Huh?  What do you do?  I broke my knee, man.  Fuck.  I swear to my fucking mother, if you touch her again, you're dead.  Hold my hand, man.  I've got to squeeze some.  Ah, fuck.  Like sand through the hourglass, so is the ONA virus. 
[00:57:00]  Those radio, and I've worked for all of them, so, you know, but I always thought it was such  a stupid thing.  The home of rock and roll, and all the other rock stations in your area, they're not the  home of rock and roll.  No.  We're the home of rock and roll.  Ah!  Oh, no.  Right on my fucking foot.  That fucking thing fell again.  Right on my fucking foot.  I can't tell you how many times last week I asked for this to be fixed, and it just fell 
[00:57:30]  on my fucking bad foot.  I have a foot thing on my foot, and it just fell on it.  Don't laugh.  I'm sorry.  He has a foot thing on his foot.  He has a foot thing on his foot.  Why did that fall again?  Why did that fall again on my bad foot?  Dude, I got a foot on my foot because I have tendinitis, I have arthritis, and I have 
[00:58:00]  ligament damage.  He's got old man foot.  And it's right on my goddamn foot.  That's the third time that fucking thing has fucking fallen.  Third time.  Holy shit, is that aggravating.  Anthony and Jimmy are very serious, and me and Bob get in a conflict.  It did not have fallen again.  Right on my foot.  Holy shit.  Holy shit.  I saw his face. 
[00:58:30]  He just hurt that freaking whack.  Scared the shit out of everybody.  And then you look at him.  Did you scare me, man?  Don't look like a stress doll.  Somebody squeezed his gut.  And then he just snapped.  I got a foot thing on my fucking foot.  Look at his foot.  I got an arm thing on my foot.  Look at this thing.  Look at this thing.  Look at this thing.  This thing has to work.  Big, big foot thing.  I have enough problems.  He's going snowboarding after the show. 
[00:59:00]  I'm trying to avoid surgery.  Yeah.  And I have stage four damage.  I have stage three damage.  I'm one inch from surgery.  And now you get stage four.  And I want to bite somebody's fucking face for that.  How did that happen?  I want to know who fixed that.  Are you on the AZP for the stage?  Why did it not happen?  Why was that not fixed?  No one fixed it.  It wasn't fixed.  Holy shit, is that irritating.  It was fixed.  It wouldn't have fallen.  How big was the thing that fell, though?  It's this big.  It's a piece of it.  It's solid.  It falls.  It's like, it's probably eight inches off the ground. 
[00:59:30]  Opie probably has fishing string over there.  All right, right now, again.  Quack!  My fucking foot!  I got a foot of a foot!  On my foot!  Last ass fucking foot!  Opie and Anthony, the virus is spreading.  All right, you're checking out the Opie and Anthony program. 
[01:00:00]  Hi there.  By the way, tomorrow's a big day for the show, kind of, I guess.  Yeah.  It's like our one-year anniversary at XM, satellite radio.  Driving in today, I noticed we are not alone in having our one-year anniversary show, Opie.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  I was driving in.  I'm listening to XM.  I'm listening to Fox News on XM.  And I hear a commercial come on for Bob Edwards celebrating his one-year anniversary. 
[01:00:30]  Remember, we debuted at the same time.  And he's celebrating his one-year anniversary.  He's going to have some musician on.  I heard some guitar and some singing that is going to be going on.  And XM's own Hugh Pinero will be joining him on his show.  The CEO of the company.  The CEO.  We get Elo on the phone.  Maybe.  Maybe, right.  If he's not busy. 
[01:01:00]  Location check.  And he gets the CEO of the company.  Our one-year anniversary tomorrow is going to stink.  And then we got nothing.  Unless there's one huge, big surprise that we don't know about.  Yeah, a lot of people are speculating that we're going to do something big.  But as I look around at these guys, they have nothing planned.  Their heads are all spinning around.  They're looking at each other like, what?  Do you got something?  I'm going to stick a candle in your oatmeal.  About all week.  Happy one.  But we are throwing a huge party Halloween. 
[01:01:30]  To celebrate one year at XM.  You guys, you're not dressing up.  Of course.  Really?  Anthony dresses up every year.  It's Halloween.  What?  You've got to dress up.  I will not be dressing up.  Of course.  It's fun.  You've got to.  I'm not dressing up.  It's a costume party.  He plays Dungeons and Dragons.  That's the only time.  Ooh.  Ooh.  He not only dresses up, he really thinks about his costume.  He's one of those guys.  You said it has to be.  You want to go, oh my God.  How did you think of that?  He's like, he's the only one with that type of costume at the party. 
[01:02:00]  Well, I did go as some type of renaissance gentleman a couple of years back.  Would you have a big chicken in your hand, like a chicken bone?  No, I had a turkey leg.  I had one of those.  Billy Burr would have knew what that was.  Now you're starting to say it.  I had one of those white, blousey-like shirts covered with the leather vest with the puffy  sleeve things with the slits in it.  And I had my rapier sword on my side and my boots. 
[01:02:30]  Like a three-musketeer?  Yeah.  Like a three-musketeer.  Like D'Artanian or whatever?  Exactly.  Really?  Yeah.  What are you dressing up as?  I don't know.  I haven't given it enough thought.  It's going to be great because you've got to come to the party dressed as something that  has something to do with the show.  Something to do with the show.  It could be anything.  Even the smallest detail.  So no one might even come as your broken knee.  Right.  Really?  Yeah.  A lot of people have been emailing saying they're going to go as Ben's hog. 
[01:03:00]  There's going to be a few of them.  You're going to have to judge the length.  So I guess to get out of the year anniversary thing tomorrow, I guess our real celebration will  be on Halloween.  Yeah.  I'll let the guys off the hook because I know maybe they'll have a cake or something.  I don't know.  Please, no.  We encourage the listeners to stop by.  I'm sure we'll have three dopes outside.  Can we know, please?  Bring down gifts.  Maybe Opie will throw them at your face.  We said that.  Just no celebrating.  No, I like gifts these days.  You do like gifts?  Yeah.  Someone gave me Islander tickets. 
[01:03:30]  No shit?  Recently for the Flyers.  That doesn't have the same effect when you throw it at somebody's face.  I'm going down to see the Flyers and Islanders a week from Saturday.  Flitters in their face a little.  No pain.  There's like circles to the ground.  The corner hits them right in the eye.  But the Halloween party is going to be at the Hard Rock Cafe Halloween night.  It's going to be huge.  And lots of prizes for the best costumes, stuff like that.  What are you going to dress up as, Opie?  I don't dress.  Come on.  You know what Opie's going to do?  He's just going to draw like a line right here, put like a thing of blood, and go, 
[01:04:00]  I'm a dead person.  I'm dead.  Oh, the gave it no thought last minute costume guy?  I'm dead.  At the party?  Yeah.  You put the vampire teeth in?  Oh, the vampire.  The wax.  The wax teeth.  The wax teeth.  Yeah.  That's a good one.  I'm thinking of just getting one of those really cheap plastic, you know, masks.  That's actually kind of funny, dude.  You know where the little slit?  Yeah.  The little slit.  It was really tiny, so by the end of trick-or-treating, you could smell your own bad breath. 
[01:04:30]  They make your eyeballs sweat.  You just sweat like crazy in there, yeah.  You take it off, your cheeks are hot and sticky.  Sweating.  What are you going to ask?  I don't know.  I really don't know yet.  Really?  I haven't thought about it yet.  No.  Did you at least look cool?  I didn't look cool as a...  No, you looked awful.  I had a weapon.  Yeah?  Was it a real sword?  Did you get it off of a home shopping network?  For a hundred bucks and you got 5,000 knives?  I get to.  I got a rapier. 
[01:05:00]  It was a real sword.  It's a wonderful foil.  With hand protection.  Oh, it had the thing around the knuckles.  One of those, yeah.  A rapier.  I can go, like, sword fight.  Did it say all for one and one for all on it?  No, it didn't.  If you bought it right then and there, you got boots and a hat with it?  No, it's a wonderful stainless steel blade.  Jesus Christ.  A run-ye-through.  Do you still have it?  It was a real sword?  Of course I still have it.  It's under my bed.  It's my home protection now.  Someone breaks in. 
[01:05:30]  You've missed so much.  I'll have to defend myself with my sword.  If five black guys, you come in, you're going to go, on guard.  That's how he protects from the colored.  Unhand my valuables, sir.  He's going to take his sock off and slap the black dude in the face?  I challenge you to a duel.  Let me get my sword.  He's going to shoot you in your face?  That was very unutterable, you sir.  You have no manners. 
[01:06:00]  Yeah.  All right.  Well, so tomorrow's a year that we have been at XM Saturday Radio.  Congratulations.  Yeah.  That's awesome.  Yeah, a lot of people didn't think we'd make it a year.  Cool.  And there's people out there going, XM's not going to pick up the second year of their contract.  Yeah.  Well, I guess officially tomorrow they pick it up.  Tomorrow.  Even though they told us a long time ago they picked up year two and year three.  Hope Hugh isn't announcing they're not picking up our contract on the Bob Edwards show. 
[01:06:30]  That would be embarrassing, wouldn't it?  Bob Edwards and his one-hour show.  Jesus.  How do you get that deal?  Hour.  How do you get that deal?  We did an hour already and we didn't even try yet.  I'd be home.  No, we haven't even tried.  We have a whole show planned.  I'd be home.  That was just us shooting the shit for an hour.  Yeah.  God, that would be the easiest gig in the world to do that every day.  Didn't get to anything on our list.  We're just bullshitting.  What time do you guys go to bed?  You guys must go to bed early, right?  No, it's ridiculous.  I went to bed at 9.30 last night. 
[01:07:00]  Back in the third grade.  I had to watch this 60 Minutes because they had a piece on Elian Gonzalez.  I saw it.  11 years old now.  He's now 11 years old and he loves Castro.  He's a proud little commie, isn't he?  You know, they show him up there as an 11-year-old.  A lot different than that tiny little kid that was in the closet.  Being hauled away.  He's got a scar from the corner of his mouth to his ear now.  I guess it's like the first time we've seen him in a few years. 
[01:07:30]  Yeah.  And they're making a big deal out of it.  And Fidel Castro is like his best friend.  Yeah.  He says he's a good friend, Fidel Castro.  And he looks at Fidel like a father figure.  That's right.  Oh, you saw the whole thing, right?  Yeah, I saw the important clip, so I didn't see the whole thing.  Does he already have a goatee at 11?  A little peach fuzz?  Looks just like his mother.  They didn't show the scar where they cut out his brain!  Cut out his brain, you bloody baboon!  So that was pretty interesting.  He seems well adjusted.  He seems like he's doing fine in Cuba. 
[01:08:00]  Yeah.  Who are we to say?  I don't know.  Seems like he has a pretty good life.  They like the communism down there.  They're working fine with it.  How many people from Miami and Fort Lauderdale jump in the ocean and swim, try to swim to Cuba?  Yeah.  Yeah, they just get in rafts and go down there.  Yeah.  It's wonderful.  They actually make boats out of Buicks.  Yeah.  Drive them across.  Actually, we make boats out of boats here in America.  We don't really need to get a door jam and fucking jump on it and do a breaststroke.  Who's the psychopath staring at us through the glass? 
[01:08:30]  Who are you?  Who's the guest today?  Why are you staring?  Don't stare.  Who's the guest today?  I don't know, but he's staring.  It's really creepy.  Oh, he's a guy that bought the Hot Shannon body mold during our auction.  He came by to pick it up.  Those things are great.  Those things are unbelievable.  Yeah, have him face the other way.  No, he could sit there, Poe.  He could sit there.  I was just fucking with him.  You can have sex with the body mold, right?  No, not this one.  Oh.  Poe never takes anything as a joke.  Did you see the other? 
[01:09:00]  If you said, Poe, could you kill him?  He'd kill him.  I know.  And then you go, no, I was kidding.  I was kidding.  So you saw 60 Minutes?  Eclipse.  Did you see the other piece?  No.  About the guy with multiple personalities?  I did.  I saw that.  No, you didn't.  I swear to God.  So you gave up and didn't watch the Alien and Gonzalez?  That was the whole reason I was watching.  I watched that guy, but I switched over to the, what's that other show where they beat the girl up?  All these teenage chicks beat the girl up, but one girl got carried away and chopped her in the neck and then held her underwater and just let her body float down the river. 
[01:09:30]  Wow.  CSI?  No.  It was a real story, yeah.  Real?  What was, yeah, they have 60 Minutes, but on the other channel.  48 hours minus 20.  Yeah, something like that, 48 hours or something, but it was actually pretty good.  They're all the same fucking show.  Dateline?  Yeah, I think it was Dateline.  Dateline Sunday.  Yeah, it's all the same show.  Where they do 20 Minutes on something.  They definitely get you next up.  So you saw the multiple personality guy?  Yeah, I've seen that guy in the park.  But he seemed pretty normal.  They got something going on in Central Park, I think every Sunday, maybe every Saturday and Sunday. 
[01:10:00]  There's a bunch of just rollerbladers, and they set up a DJ in...  Oh, I've seen that.  I went walking last weekend.  They have a big circle and a DJ in the middle, and these guys skate with rollerblades or old school roller skating.  And you saw the whole thing?  Yeah.  Well, they're a bunch of creeps, actually.  They're a bunch of serial killers and just misfits that don't fit into regular society,  and they all get together and just rollerblade.  Really?  That's the only thing I can figure out. 
[01:10:30]  They did look creepy.  And they all got their own moves that they're known for.  You know the black guy that puts the bottle of water on his head?  Yeah, yeah.  A slow motion guy?  Yeah.  I saw him live.  Slow motion guy.  He's like, he makes believe everything's in slow...  It's really kind of an impossible.  But he puts a bottle of water on his head.  Anybody...  And just holds it there.  Did you see old guy with bottle of water on his head?  No.  Because that's the guy that was featured on 60 Minutes last night.  And I've seen him in the park...  Who's ripping off who?  A million times.  Tell him, Fred.  Anyway, so I've...  You know, because I go to the park a lot, I've seen this whole thing go down, you know? 
[01:11:00]  And I'm convinced that these people are absolutely nuts with the old school, you know, roller  skates like you're saying, and the roller blades and all that.  And they got some really cool music and people sit on the hill and just listen to the music,  watch the skaters.  It's a thing you do in the park.  One of many things.  Thing.  And so there's an older guy with a beard and he wears a hat and he's got sunglasses and  he also does the water bottle trick, right?  Yeah.  He was featured on 60 Minutes last night.  It turns out he's like an expert on Asian culture.  He's met like the first Bush and he's just known in the Asian community. 
[01:11:30]  Like he knows everything about it.  Walter Cronkite back in the day interviewed this guy.  It turns out he's got multiple personalities.  Really?  And the one that, he goes to the park when Bobby takes over, who's this crazy kid, Bobby.  Yeah.  Oh, his personality, Bobby.  Yeah.  Who's a little kid.  But they're interviewing the guy and he's got a suit and tie and he's very distinguished  and like I said, knows everything about China and the Asian culture, but. 
[01:12:00]  He had a party for President Bush.  Right.  Okay, the first Bush.  Wow.  And he goes, what were you thinking?  As you were there.  He goes, well, it was Bobby.  Bobby was at the party.  And the President, now this is the CIA, the Secret Service everywhere, okay?  The President's there.  He threw the party for this guy.  And this guy's a fucking lunatic.  Oh, my God.  He's actually like a nine-year-old boy in his head going, this is boring.  This is boring.  Wow, look at all the Secret Service.  And he's like a distinguished Asian, you know, expert. 
[01:12:30]  And now he roller skates as the nine-year-old kid.  As Bobby, right.  And then this is great.  Like, this was.  Why does he do the thing with the water on his head?  Wouldn't he be a kid like.  Because they all have some move down there.  If you go there a few times, you'll see the same guys doing the same shit.  You got slow motion guys.  Oh, I know.  But if he's a nine-year-old kid, he'd be skating like a nine-year-old kid, which is just like,  try to skate as fast as you can.  Right, right.  A little more crazy.  But.  Yeah.  I think he's lying. 
[01:13:00]  So, this was where it was amazing.  He married some lady that's also an expert at Asian culture.  Some Indian lady.  Some Indian lady.  And he had an affair.  But it's okay because Bobby had the affair.  Yeah, Bobby had the affair.  Like, he met one of these fellow skaters and had an affair.  And that's how he was able to get out of it with his wife.  As a nine-year-old, he had an affair?  Yeah.  Or, well, maybe this kid is.  Maybe he's a little older now.  He does.  Oh, does he age, too?  I don't know.  It's a, you know.  Interesting.  It was definitely weird.  Interesting line of shit this guy has. 
[01:13:30]  And it didn't help that his wife is a fat Indian lady now.  Right.  Yeah.  That doesn't help.  That's, you know, when you're a fat Indian lady, you really can't, when your husband  cheats on you, you kind of have to take the hit.  Yeah.  You really, that's how he got out of it, by saying he's got multiple personalities and  it was another one of his personalities that had the affair.  Why did you cheat on me?  He grabs a mirror and sticks it in front of her.  Look at you, you fucking bags under your eyes.  You fatso.  Why do you think Bobby cheated on you?  Little Bobby. 
[01:14:00]  Bobby, Sarah, Mickey.  We all did.  Frankie hates your fucking guts, too.  Yeah, one of his personalities is a lady.  The witch.  A witch.  That's right.  She goes, and she's on TV with a straight face going, when I first met him, I wanted  to meet the witch.  And it scared me.  And it scared me.  What is this accomplishing by going on TV?  Like, there's some shit you just should not confess to.  He wrote a fucking book.  Oh, okay.  He's making some cake.  I'm going to write a book.  I have nine personalities.  Scam artist.  Come on. 
[01:14:30]  Right now, this is Fat Bob.  It's a scam.  You're dealing with Fat Bob right now.  What the brilliance of you.  Could you channel Bill Burr, please?  Yeah, no shit.  Hey, dude.  What's going on, dude?  Dude, what's up, dude?  This is Angry Baby Bill Burr.  Hey, dude.  Listen.  Dude, fucking Bob Kelly.  I swear to God, he's crazy.  Sounds good like him.  Hey, we recorded 60 Minutes.  I don't know.  It was boring, because this whole piece on this guy with the multiple personalities,  you would think they would show him doing the other fucking personalities.  That's what people want to see with multiple personalities.  He refused.  He refused to let Bobby come out or the witch. 
[01:15:00]  How could you refuse?  Doesn't it just come out?  This guy can control his shit?  This guy is so full of crap.  You're schizo.  Yes.  You've got multiple personalities.  You can control when they come out.  Sybil couldn't control.  No.  Throw herself against the wall.  How great was that movie?  Oh.  That was great.  Nice 1978 TV movie reference.  Sally Field, right?  Sally Field, right.  Yeah.  I used to get that confused with The Exorcist all the time, because they kind of looked,  and I was always just waiting for her to just grab a cross and just go, come on, fuck it,  fuck it, fuck it, fuck it, fuck it, fuck it, fuck it, fuck it, fuck it, fuck it, fuck it, 
[01:15:30]  All right.  So anyway, going back, tomorrow's the year that we've been at XM Satellite Radio.  I want to thank everyone for supporting us.  I want to thank the best for all you do on a regular basis.  Our staff.  The staff, everybody, sure, why not?  What about you guys?  Why don't you pat yourselves on the back for putting on a great program?  Every morning.  Going to bed at 9.30, like fucking elderly couples.  We are great.  And waking up every day and putting on a big show.  I actually stayed up to watch Family Guy.  Yeah.  The love Family Guy.  What a fucking bore fest.  What happened to that show? 
[01:16:00]  And I said that when the show, I don't even know if it was a repeat, because I watched  like the first two episodes when it finally came back, and I went on the air and said how  awful the show has become, because I've seen every old episode a million times.  I've got the DVDs and all that.  And I bailed on, and everyone gave me shit, like, what is wrong with you?  The show's great.  Yeah.  So then I tuned it in again last night, and I just fucking hate it now.  Wow.  What happened?  I don't know if it's edge or something.  I don't know.  But they're trying to be edgy.  Is that it? 
[01:16:30]  I don't know.  Are they trying too hard?  I really don't know.  I don't know what the problem is.  I think a couple of their gags are pretty funny, but then on the whole, the show's a  little dull.  Doesn't have staining power?  Nah.  I was too busy watching extreme home makeovers.  I'm fucking finished.  What, are you just enjoying?  Were you crying?  Yeah.  I can't.  Let me tell you.  Look it.  I don't know what's wrong with me.  I don't know who touched me when I was a kid.  I really don't.  I haven't cried.  Honestly, God, I haven't cried.  Since that midget proposed.  I've had people die.  I've had, like, serious incidents in my life. 
[01:17:00]  I haven't cried in probably maybe 15, 16 years.  Okay?  But I can't watch this fucking show.  I don't know this.  I'll tell you why I laugh as hard as a guy can laugh.  Go ahead.  The little foster kid and, you know, the little girls, she can't be in the sun.  Right.  And we built a whole backyard where she can just walk around because it has solar panels  that deflect the sun.  Like, all covered up because she can't be in the sun. 
[01:17:30]  The little, you know, the little Mexican kid who got adopted.  And the tears just start.  And I can't watch.  When you see the father goes, you know, well, you know, I'm just blessed and I don't want  to cry.  But, you know, men don't want to cry.  And then he loses it.  Men cry, I guess, sometimes.  And Bob loses it.  And then he puts his head down and pinches right in between his eyes.  Yeah.  And I'm just done.  I got to walk out of the room.  I can't.  There's something about the kids.  The kids and the dad.  Not going to lie to you.  The kid angle gets to me, too. 
[01:18:00]  It gets to you?  Yeah, a little bit.  It's something about a little kid with the little things that attach to your forearms.  The little braces.  The little braces.  And they're walking in.  And the crutches, yeah.  And they're going to swing their hip around.  And then they come in and they get a brand new bedroom with, like, a little thing they  can sit in.  Right.  And it swings them over to the bed.  And it swings them over to the bed.  Because they make these amazing homes out of these piece-of-shit houses.  In the shitty neighborhood.  In the shitty neighborhood.  And that's what makes me laugh so hard. 
[01:18:30]  Because I know after the film crews are gone, these people are doing everything they can  to protect their shit.  They just want to go to TGIFs on a Friday for one last hour.  They come back in this gang site.  And fucking graffiti all over their house.  As the crew's leaving, the neighbors are coming up like a zombie movie.  Slowly walking down the block toward your house.  It turns into a bad Jan Michael Vincent movie with his name.  They don't know what the fuck happened to them after the crew leaves.  But, you know, they always walk in and look for the flat screen. 
[01:19:00]  As soon as they walk into the house, they're like, where's the...  Is this mine?  Do I get to this, too?  That's why...  Do I get to keep to this?  Keep to this.  What is he, Italian black?  That's why I always...  Mama Mia's.  That's why I always laugh, though.  Because those houses are always in the middle of some horrendous neighborhood.  And you just know what's going on after they leave.  Yeah.  It's some crap hole.  Yeah, they're going to keep that cute little waterfall going in the backyard.  Oh, sure.  Sure they are.  They don't show these people how to maintain everything. 
[01:19:30]  Well, they did one with the Mexican guy who lost his leg in Iraq.  But then in the back, they put a whole dance floor with all this music and shit.  You know his white neighbors are going to be like, oh, that's pisser.  Great.  Now he goes to the margarina fight at four in the morning.  This guy's going to be hopping around on one leg.  Oh, margarina.  Has reality TV gone too far?  Yes.  The Today Show is discussing that at length as we speak. 
[01:20:00]  I really am a pussy.  I can't watch that show.  Oh, yeah.  I don't know what it is.  Kids make kids kill me.  And to see a grown man, like a man-man cry.  Yeah.  To see like a kind of, you know, whatever guy cry.  Oh, you know what's the worst?  You ever see the series Band of Brothers?  Yeah.  And at the end of it, they had the actual guys from World War II discussing their camaraderie  and all that.  Right.  Oh, and it's just some old guy talking about his buddies he lost over there. 
[01:20:30]  It's like how many years later and he just starts welling up.  Yeah, that's pretty bad.  They did that.  Look, Bobby's crying right now just thinking about it.  Because I was just laughing because they did that with the crew from the Bismarck.  Yeah.  And the little, the two Nazi dudes were crying.  But you know there's a film crew there and they're all Jews.  Nazi guys.  And everybody's like, these cocksuckers are crying?  They're just like, the blogger, the blogger, the blogger, the blogger.  The Bismarckger, fucking blogger, blogger. 
[01:21:00]  I didn't know you spoke such fluent German.  Well, you know, Billy might be smart, but I know five different languages.  Arigato.  Let's say hi to Jimmy.  Jimmy.  Hey.  Not that, Jimmy.  What's up, Jimmy?  Did you guys see the episode where these people had a house where cars kept barreling through  their front yard and they had to build these bunkers that would come out of the ground?  Not bunkers, but like these barricades that would come out of the ground on these motors.  Because cars just kept coming through their front yard.  It was like in East L.A. 
[01:21:30]  Are you kidding?  Yeah, I want to start a new reality show.  As soon as those crews leave, I want to set a shop across the street with the camera that's  running 24 hours a day.  Watch them pick the place apart.  Just slowly but surely watch the homies come by.  Because they show.  Like the ants taking away the cricket one part at a time.  Little wing.  That little ant carrying the big wing down the hall.  A leg.  Getting a stepladder and taking the dish off the roof to begin with.  A colony of golfers come in and take the stuff out. 
[01:22:00]  Because they show the people.  They're like, yeah, we got you six brand new laptops.  Yeah.  For all six of you kids.  We got you five flat screen TVs.  Gone.  Brand new windows.  Gone.  Yeah, you have a brand new grill.  Your alleged role in the CIA league get knocked right off the front page.  And third, become as egocentric as you can be.  Be cranky, mean, and hateful to everybody and about everything. 
[01:22:30]  Because the only way to be as clueless as you are.  I'm just got a word that I'm just talking about this again.  Is to start acting like the man who turned that very process into a freaking cottage industry.  The I-Man.  And while you're at it, get yourself a cowboy hat too.  Because you can never look quite as stupid in it as he does.  Bill Clinton here on the I-Man's Morning Program.  Oh, well, MSNBC because I didn't know who he was doing it first.  Okay. 
[01:23:00]  Let me, hold on.  We got distracted.  Dan in Connecticut.  Go ahead, Dan.  Yeah, dude.  I was just turning on the TV to make my steel-cut oats to be like Opie.  And the dude doing the Bill Clinton voice was all XM202.  O-N-A, party rock.  O-N-A, party rock.  You did that whole thing again?  Awesome.  Absolutely awesome.  Rob Bartlett.  All right.  Really funny, man.  Cool.  Thank you, bro.  Let's say hi to Pool Boy in Atlanta.  Pool Boy.  Yeah, we're just going to call in. 
[01:23:30]  You're talking about the home improvement show.  We did a house.  I was actually one of the heating and air contractors.  We did the work over in Lake City, Georgia.  And these people had nothing.  As they're filming it, they've got police keeping people from getting in the street.  Make a long story short, six months later, you guys are dead on the money.  Everything was racked.  I mean, the house was infested.  I mean, it was like probably about a $500,000 house in a $60,000 area.  Wow.  And they were celebrities. 
[01:24:00]  You couldn't go down their driveway.  They had a security guard out front.  But you guys are dead on the money about the show.  Yeah, if they really want to take care of these people,  get them out of the really bad neighborhood and give them a really nice house somewhere else.  I mean, that is just, you're setting them up for a complete disaster.  They say, and we took care of your mortgage.  Really?  You paid $1,850?  Yeah.  Thanks a lot.  You took care of all 30 years?  You just made me a mark, you ass.  You gave me five flat screens.  Right. 
[01:24:30]  What's wrong with you?  Yeah, I know.  I just asked for a house.  I didn't ask to get killed.  What's wrong with you?  That is so true, man.  It's going to be four walls, a couple windows, and maybe some bars on it.  How about that?  You ever think about putting bars on the windows?  Barricade the place up.  How about a 50-foot fence around the beautiful house?  Looks like the road warrior.  They're all in there in the compound.  You see all the people outside waiting?  They're waiting for you to move that bus and get the fuck out of here to take my TVs.  Because your neighbors are so understanding. 
[01:25:00]  What am I going to do?  I've got a kid on crutches.  I've got one leg.  Yeah, they even broadcast that you have a kid that you're going to have to wait behind  more.  My kid can't go in the sun, you ass.  The weak zebra.  What the hell is wrong with you?  Oh, it is so true.  You know, I was going to go to the next stage here, but all right, I'll let Sean start the  discussion.  Go ahead, Sean.  Denver, go.  Yeah, hey, I just, I know it's different from the houses.  Not really.  Yeah, go ahead. 
[01:25:30]  What about the kids that have sent my ride car?  That is even worse.  You don't think those fucking cars are getting, you know, jacked?  Absolutely.  Oh, my God.  We just put a computer, a 50-foot flat screen in the back of the, and we know you live in  Compton, but you're all the rage.  All four doors have plasma televisions in them when you open it up.  I just want it not to stall on the 405.  I don't need flat screens in my rearview mirror, you ass.  Thanks for advertising the car.  Hey, we gave you 18-karat gold nugget license plate. 
[01:26:00]  Right.  Yeah.  Did you see the pimp my ride that was on this weekend?  No.  We gave you diamond interior.  They put a turntable where the glove box used to be.  Oh, God.  A turntable, so you open that up, and now you can whatever.  And then he opens up the trunk, and it's a fully loaded computer, wireless.  Yeah, wireless computer.  With an iPod, so you can now download your music while you're driving, and then take the 
[01:26:30]  iPod into the front to play the tunes you just downloaded.  And then they put some kind of ridiculous bass woofer in this thing that looks like it  belongs on a jet engine.  It looks like a fucking, literally, you have no back seat.  And I think, he made the, the guy had a four-seater, now it's a two-seater.  Oh, stop.  Yeah, you gotta see the bass woofer, whatever it's called, I don't know the shit, how big  this fucking thing was.  You can't drive near the airport with this, you get immediately pulled over. 
[01:27:00]  It looks like you have a bomb in your back seat.  Then they had a, had a, put a warning system in it, like warning lights and stuff, if you  turn it up too loud, then you're basically gonna blow out your own eardrums.  Yeah.  This thing was so much ridiculous.  It was like a jet engine in the back seat.  That's ridiculous.  They had to specially build a frame for this stupid thing.  And you know it was the black dudes.  No.  Yeah.  They had to get a cherry picker to get it into the car so heavy.  Right.  And you know it was the black dudes, like, yo man, I ain't putting this shit in my car,  but let's put it in this white dude's car.  Yeah, let's see what it looks like.  Get up.  Pimps and ride. 
[01:27:30]  Pimps and ride.  Going back to the projects with, uh.  Yeah, thanks dude.  Yeah, I appreciate that.  I want, I'd love to see, like, three months after the show.  Oh, forget about it.  It has no doors.  Every day the car's getting shot at like the Kennedy limo.  Yeah.  He's just trying to drive down the street.  They're just trying to take out the tires.  How about the bulletproof windows?  I swear to God, they, in every place they live though, it looks like the same house.  Yeah.  They go up to the, X, X to the Z, as he likes to be called.  He goes up to the same house. 
[01:28:00]  Get the cage over the front door.  Yeah.  Bars on the window.  Oh, God.  And someone's saying, once they redo these homes, going back to that thing, families can't afford  property taxes.  Well, the thing is, is that sometimes they pay the mortgage off.  Yeah.  But when you build, when you build a house like that, you take a ranch, okay, on wheels, and  then you build a palace, you know, eight bedroom with four bathrooms, with a built-in pool, everything changes. 
[01:28:30]  Now your taxes are $20,000 a year.  $20,000.  Dummy, he's getting foster kids, not because he likes taking care of kids, because he needs  the money.  They give him money.  They give him money to take care of them.  Yeah, he needs the money.  You saw that one?  Yeah.  They had a house full of retards.  Yeah.  I was in a foster home.  You think they did it because they cared about kids?  Yeah, 20 kids.  This kid, the guy used to make me go out during the day.  Wait, you were in a foster...  And walk around, because he liked to be in his underwear.  You were a foster child?  Yeah, I was in like five foster homes.  All right. 
[01:29:00]  Well, we're not getting to anything today.  All right.  Well, that's the rest of the show.  That explains everything.  A foster child.  Dude, I was...  Do you know who your parents are?  No.  Yes.  At all?  I know my parents, of course.  Oh, you do?  Yeah, it wasn't like I was, you know, raised by foster people.  When I went to Juvie Hall, after when I got out, they wouldn't let me go home.  What?  Because they blamed it on your parents, right?  No.  I just didn't want to go home.  I went to a foster... 
[01:29:30]  They actually put you...  You go from Juvenile Hall to a foster home back home.  Can we hold that thought?  Yeah, why?  Because Peter Brady's girlfriend just walked by.  Is that who it is?  Holy shit.  We have to...  She is amazing.  Someone remind us that we have to go back down this road with Bob Kelly.  Because we got Chris Knight and...  Of course we do.  Chris Knight, Opie.  Don't call him Peter Brady.  Hey...  Chris Knight and his lovely, lovely girlfriend have just arrived for a little interview.  You did that with Greg Brady for a long time. 
[01:30:00]  I understand that.  Yes, Ben?  What do you got?  What?  Yeah.  Give me a gun.  We saw her boobs way before we saw her.  What the hell is going on?  The whole atmosphere out there changes when, like, a hot girl walks in.  Holy crap.  Everybody starts...  But is Peter here, too?  It's not Peter.  I mean, um...  Christopher.  Chris Knight, sorry.  Christopher Knight.  All right, we'll talk to them.  What is the show called?  My Fair Brady, right?  My Fair Brady.  See?  It's like My Fair Lady, but they put the Brady.  Gotcha.  Anytime a Brady's involved, they gotta switch a word and make it Brady. 
[01:30:30]  All right, we'll talk to them in just a few minutes here, and then we'll get to Bob Kelly.  Yeah, look at you.  Bob Kelly.  Hey, Billy might be smart and intelligent and witty, but I have some good, dirty, fucking  horrible stories for you.  You're a mess.  I'm not smart and witty, but I have to open up and tell you all my awful stuff.  I fucked the sink.  Okay, let's move on.  All right, here's the deal.  So tomorrow's the year anniversary at XM Satellite Radio.  Yeah.  So Laszlo and Steve, Martini Steve, got together and put together a nice piece of production 
[01:31:00]  here.  I want to hear this.  I think it's like some kind of anniversary movie trailer thing.  All right, let's take a listen.  Each day, millions of Americans gather around their satellite radios, awaiting the rallying  cry that unifies them all.  It's the Opie and Anthony show, but it's a show where every day may be their last.  As they celebrate one year back on the air, let's look back on moments that could have 
[01:31:30]  been their final sign-off.  This one, right?  Yes.  Oh.  What are you?  Motherfucker.  Oh, Bernie, Bernie.  Stand up for your right, Bernie.  Get out.  Oh, my God.  Don't play vigilante Bernard Gantz has shot and killed radio shock jocks Opie and Anthony  during an apparent psychotic meltdown over a broken CD.  Let's go to our token Asian correspondent, Wei Xing Cao.  Another close call came with Tippy Tom, and it could have gone terribly wrong. 
[01:32:00]  Are you guys ready to wake up Tippy Tom?  Tippy Tom.  Tommy.  Uh-oh, he might be dead.  He could be.  Does he have a pulse?  Yeah, does he have a pulse?  He looks a little blue.  Oh, Mike, we could have a problem.  A homeless man died live on national radio today on the Opie and Anthony show after passing  out and swallowing his own tongue.  XM Satellite Radio fired the controversial radio team.  XM Vice President of Programming Eric Logan, who has great hair, is denying any liability. 
[01:32:30]  And while their assault on the media campaign has attracted national attention, the consequences  could have been severe.  Breaking news.  Former CBS reporter Arthur Cheehan has reportedly gone on a rampage outside the XM studios in  New York, attacking Opie and Anthony with a samurai sword while shouting the same expletive  that got him fired.  What the fuck is your problem, man?  But those things didn't happen.  So it's a time of celebration for year one of the Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:33:00]  There'll be drinks held high in the air, bear hugs, and for a few, maybe even a tranny.  Remember, every O&A show is a moment to cherish.  Because each show could be their last.  Opie and Anthony, the virus is spreading.  And it burns when I pee.  Wow.  Very good.  Holy shit, what a great concept. 
[01:33:30]  All it needed was a Ramon, I think.  And you're right.  That was very good.  The day with Tippy Tom, we were convinced he was dead.  Yeah.  They only gave you a little piece of that audio.  We were convinced that the guy was dead outside the studio.  Yeah, that was great, thinking our careers were pretty much done.  And I'm laughing, like, ah, he's dead.  And then we're like, well, is he?  And then Keith the cop was like, dude, ah, I don't know what the fuck's going on.  I can't get a pulse on this guy.  He checked his pulse and he didn't have a pulse?  No.  How thick was his skin?  With all the mites on it. 
[01:34:00]  Was he really, like...  Oh, he's full of crust.  Full crusty.  And his color was fucked up to begin with, so then you're thinking, he's not waking up  and the color's fucked up.  It's all dirty.  Is it like a homemade potato chip?  Is that what his skin feels like?  Exactly.  Like a Cape Cod chip?  Who touched him?  Who touched him to even see if he had a pulse?  You know, he put gloves on and stuff.  Cops really do go above and beyond.  And then he did some kind of water trick.  Yeah.  You drop water in the ear and that wakes you up instantly, I guess?  Yeah, who did that, Poe? 
[01:34:30]  Was it Poe?  It was Poe's trick, yeah.  Oh, it was Poe.  I'm sorry.  I thought it was...  You drop water in the ear and you wake up instantly.  Yeah, I don't know what that's about.  I don't want to know.  Yeah.  Wow.  We're going to take a break.  Yeah, I've got to take a leak.  We're going to talk to Peter Brady.  We're going to take a poo.  And his lovely, lovely girlfriend next.  Yeah, which?  What?  Why?  Where?  Shark.  What?  What?  Who?  What?  We have problems. 
[01:35:00]  Shake it up.  Shake it up.  Shake it up.  There's too many men, too many people, making too many problems, and there's not a plot of blood to go around, and you see this is a land of confusion, this is the world we live in, and these are the hands we're given, use them and let's start trying. 
[01:35:30]  To make it a place worth living in. 
[01:36:00]  We've got some big, big stars coming into the studio, big stars.  That's right.  Christopher Knight and Adrian Carey from My Fair Brady.  Hello.  Good morning.  Couple.  What's up, guys?  Did you just wake up?  You look like, what am I getting myself into?  I always have this look of trepidation.  Is that it?  Yeah.  Trepidation.  I lost my ball.  That's fine. 
[01:36:30]  What did you have under the baseball?  Adrian, grab it.  Tossing it around.  Yeah.  There you go.  There's your ball.  Now it's all with the world.  Wow.  Did you have to wear that?  You're killing us, Pete.  Yeah, I did, sadly.  Oh, my God.  Jesus.  Unbelievable.  Amazing.  You really pulled it together, didn't you, Chris?  Yeah, I've been gifted here.  God damn, dude.  And I don't like the fact that you fight it on the show.  So, why not?  She's unbelievable.  He likes men. 
[01:37:00]  I would.  Honey, who doesn't?  Who doesn't?  They play video games.  They play video games all day long.  It's scary.  I guess we should explain.  We're all staring at your beautifulness.  Your beautifulness.  My no bra-liness.  No bra.  It's one thing that it's no bra, but it's perfect.  They're pretty much out.  Perfect.  Thanks.  It's like I saw that on Rome last night.  I love that show.  There's a lot of nudity on there.  Yeah, it's great.  And, like, sex. 
[01:37:30]  Yeah.  In front of, like, their mom and all that.  Last night was a little much.  I didn't see it.  A lot of man junk.  Yeah.  A lot of man junk last night.  Well, Anthony was talking about how there's too much naked hogs.  Yeah, too much guy cock.  Was it the cock or the size of the cock that bothered you?  Size.  Size?  Oh, it was awful.  Huge.  Huge.  Big man dick.  I didn't see that.  You missed last night's episode.  On demand.  She's going to want the DVD set now.  The last episode I saw is when they were prying that guy's eye out, and didn't they cut off  his ear? 
[01:38:00]  Yeah, that was a good one.  And his thumbs.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's good.  That's fun to watch.  What time did you get up to look as beautiful as you are right now?  Like, he was talking about this.  I woke up at 5.30.  5.30.  And then...  Well, there's a contrast, because you woke up like we wake up.  No, he woke up at 5.30.  Just roll out of bed, a quick shower, throw a t-shirt on, you're good to go, right?  It looks like you've been up for hours getting ready for this.  No, I am very proud that I'm the only woman that can get ready in 40 minutes.  In the shower, out, you know, lotion everywhere.  Yep, 40 minutes.  Lotion everywhere.  It's a dream. 
[01:38:30]  Hey, how's our friend Barry doing?  Barry's doing okay.  Barry used to do our show all the time.  I don't know if he's ever talked about us, but we all were buddy-buddy for a while there.  And I actually...  When he lived back here in New York?  No, I actually, when we were off the air for two years, I actually saw his groovy pad, too,  at the top of the hill a few times.  Yeah.  Oh, she's tapping you.  Well, what happened?  There's hot chicks all over the wall.  Yeah, well, your picture's got to get up there.  Oh, whoa, whoa, that one had her boobs hanging out.  Yeah.  Well, there's a...  Lindsay Lohan when she was hot before she lost all the weight.  Yeah, we got a wall filled with very, very hot celebrity photos. 
[01:39:00]  And now...  I'm not so into Paris, though.  There's no interview because of it.  Paris has no butt.  Paris needs a butt.  Paris...  She needs a butt.  You think she needs a butt?  Oh, yeah.  And she's got great perky boobies, but she has absolutely no...  You know what?  I actually saw her in Vegas at the Hard Rock, and she has absolutely...  She has a spaded shovel ass.  You know what, though?  She's got a fucking...  Oh, can we talk openly here?  She can take it like a pro.  Yeah, you can curse.  She cut her man off who was talking about his career and friends just because there was 
[01:39:30]  tits on the wall.  Yes.  It happens all the time.  I'm totally used to it.  Oh, God bless you.  What are you talking about?  If a set walks by, they're pointed out for me.  Really?  Yeah.  I had a boring story anyway, whatever.  No, go on.  I used to visit...  Was it about boobs?  No, I mean, I just want to know how Barry's doing, that's all, because we haven't seen  him in a while.  You know, Barry's doing well.  He's going through a tough passage right now.  But I think that he's got a court date in November, and I think things are going to  clear up, hopefully, well for him. 
[01:40:00]  Last time we saw him was at the premiere party for My Fair Brady, and he had this really  hot blonde with him, so I think he's doing okay.  Yeah.  I mean, he's going to war.  He is going to war.  It's war.  It's all about custody.  What the fuck happened?  His ex seems like a bitch, no offense.  I hung out with them, I don't know, three, four, five times, and it seemed like they were  in love.  They had a kid together, and all of a sudden, it made the tabloids that they're getting a  divorce, and it's really ugly.  This has happened to me, and she doesn't get it, but all of a sudden, that's all happening, 
[01:40:30]  and then left turn.  Well, you people...  And you're sitting there going, what?  That sounds like gold-digging, succubus devils, if you ask me.  But I...  It could be just women.  Did they have a prenup?  There was no signs of trouble in the household, that's what I'm saying.  I heard she was making all the money in the relationship.  That's crazy.  As far as a prenup goes.  It's not about money, it's about custody.  Yeah, of their kids.  She didn't want to live in L.A. anymore.  You can take kids, so...  Ugh, take them all.  See, that's horrible that she's using her own child, though, as a weapon. 
[01:41:00]  Well, I don't think she's using it as a weapon.  You pick them up by the heels and beat them with the head.  I think she used Barry for a child.  Really?  I don't think she really needed nothing to be married.  I've thrown out three of them, I've got nothing.  Did you?  Yeah.  Well, you don't need to worry about that.  I'm on birth control, and I don't want a baby, because I like my body exactly how it is.  Wow.  We do, too.  Good girl.  God, she's not really consistent with that.  Hey, I said, I said...  I got her three cats, we're okay for a couple months.  Pardon me. 
[01:41:30]  I said, if I do want to have kids, I want to have them later on in my 20s, so that...  I don't want to have them when I'm 30.  Later on.  When she's 25.  The older you have them, the harder it is to get your body back.  That's true.  And I said, if I do have this baby, and if my boobs start sagging down my ankles, you'll  fix them with some good old-fashioned silk on them.  How later on in your 20s?  Like 28, 29.  Oh, okay.  I'm 23.  23.  23 in five years.  She's all real, too.  God, what the fuck?  Well, they're not very big, so...  What did you do?  I suppose they are.  What did you do? 
[01:42:00]  He was a Brady.  What did you do?  What happened to Bobby and his teeth?  And his hair?  I mean, Bobby's just a mess.  What the fuck?  You got abs?  You're in shape?  I remember when you were on, what was the surreal life, and that, you're supposed to  be the older guy and that young model, and then when you took your shirt off, it was  the gayest moment on television.  He went, do you work out?  And you tried to blow him off.  Yeah, I work out a little bit.  He's like, you look like you work out a lot.  I like to...  He was so impressed. 
[01:42:30]  At Chris's body.  No, it was competition.  It was competition.  He thought he was going to be like an old dude, like Bobby looks.  Yeah, with yellow teeth and no tricep muscles.  Yeah, what's wrong with Bobby?  I don't know.  What are you doing?  He's got good teeth.  What are you talking about?  I'm kidding.  Relax.  Bobby!  Bobby, go brush your teeth.  I don't want it, Dad.  I like chewing on candy bars and tobacco.  I love those.  I love the little clips.  Picture Peter walking through, all happy. 
[01:43:00]  Hey, Mom, look at this chicken thing.  We've done that.  Yeah, I know.  That didn't go over too big.  Well, that's because she wants to have sex with you, so she needs me out of the picture.  Jesus, really?  Probably.  What's wrong with that?  I don't know.  There's nothing wrong with it, but to bluntly ask somebody to...  What was the gayest moment on TV, though?  Because you didn't finish the story.  And that was just when he took his shirt off, and this other model, you know, he was...  Marcus, whatever his name was.  Shank my bird.  You know, he's shredded. 
[01:43:30]  He works out.  You can tell he hits the gym a lot, and he was just looking at his body like, oh, my God,  dude, it'll work out too.  Maybe we could hit...  He's trying to blow him...  Everything he says, he's trying to blow him off.  He's like, yeah, whatever, dude.  Maybe we go to gym tomorrow.  We wake up at five in the morning so we can steam before the women wake up.  Me, you.  Marcus is definitely...  We get the midget to rub us down?  I will totally stand up for him, because Marcus is not gay.  Marcus was actually very offended that I fell for Chris and not him.  Really?  Absolutely, because he's perfect. 
[01:44:00]  Marcus is a poor guy.  He's a regular guy.  No, he's not.  Actually, he's not.  He just doesn't have any...  He came across as a bore on that show.  He doesn't say anything unless he has something to say.  He was so boring on that show.  Chris, can I...  Well, because we took the show from him, because he wasn't, you know, doing cartwheels, smoking,  smoking funny stuff, and getting naked in the jacuzzi, you know?  Or peeing on the floor.  Or peeing on the floor.  Or picking up midgets by the head.  He speaks six different languages, and English is hard for him, and he gets a little, you know,  scared if he's saying something right or not.  That version of the Surreal Life was the best one so far. 
[01:44:30]  I don't know how they're ever going to beat it.  The best thing ever.  With that...  When he was on that little wheelie thing they gave him.  Oh, the lock.  When he was on his lock.  The little rascal on his little rascal.  Just keep backing up like a drunk driver.  We stole his key.  Really?  We stole his key.  We put him in bed and stole his key.  He was totally asleep that entire time.  That was sleepwalking except around a scooter.  I love when he fell over outside, and you kind of kept trying to hold him by his head  to pick him back up. 
[01:45:00]  Well, because tell them why.  Tell them why he fell over.  No, I think that you're probably going to help me here, aren't you?  Uh-oh.  He...  They didn't show this because he screwed someone at VH1 just so he can always look good  in all the shows, but he picked up Vern and picked him up and spun him around and around  and around and around until Vern got sick, then he put Vern down, then Vern was going  like this.  Did you really do that?  Yeah, he felt obliged to have to take care of him because he's the one that screwed him  up.  Son of a bitch.  You came off like a superstar.  You don't spin midgets.  No.  You came off...  Right over your head.  It was the funniest thing I ever saw, though, watching him spin him around. 
[01:45:30]  He came off like the caretaker, like this nice guy.  I know.  I was really offended.  And you're sitting there spinning the midget during commercials.  If you ask me what I did, that's what I did.  All right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right,  all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right.  If you're all right, you wouldn't be saying it so much.  I'm all right, I'm all right.  Drunks like repeating themselves.  We found that out with Steve-O.  Remember...  Ew, Steve-O.  Yeah.  He puts firecrackers in his butt.  Yeah, bottle rockets and firecrackers. 
[01:46:00]  That was so gross.  And didn't he put the little car up there?  No, no, no.  That's the other dude.  He refused to do it, yeah.  Yeah, that's right.  Yeah.  That's reality television, my friends.  At its finest.  I miss that.  And Chyna was on the show, too, right, with you guys?  Oh, yeah.  She's a doll.  She's sweet.  She was all over the place.  But she's crazy, and she was on a lot of drugs.  Yeah, she came off really, like, out there.  But something happened.  Loosely tethered.  We used to have her on the show a lot, and she was relatively normal, and then, I don't  know, after she left the wrestling world...  She's back in the normal again. 
[01:46:30]  She just...  Did you see the movie?  What movie?  No.  Oh, gosh.  I saw clips, and I showed her pictures.  Oh, you saw pictures?  Yeah, I saw some pictures.  You know she has a small penis, right?  What did you think about that?  She's got a small penis.  Oh, Jesus.  What did you think about that?  That's from steroid years.  I was going to ask you a question.  What did you think about that little mushroom cap?  Oh, jeep.  Bob.  Wait, you have mushroom cap?  I think that perhaps steroids has its purpose.  Yeah.  There was something going on down there.  All swall.  Hey!  Stop.  She could kick your ass. 
[01:47:00]  I'd watch it.  Yeah, she'd make you blow her.  Oh.  Oh.  What?  Bob.  What?  Hey, hey.  We're trying to get along with her.  An icon of a very...  I love her.  I love her.  I think she's fantastic.  Can I be honest with you?  Is there a very wholesome program that children watch?  An icon?  I'm sorry, Chris.  No, it's all right.  Oh, yeah.  He's so innocent.  Do you watch it?  I just watched him naked in a tub with her on TV.  You don't think they're doing freaky stuff?  Do you watch the old Brady Bunch show?  No.  I mean, I might have seen it when I was really young, but I don't remember.  Phil Packer episode. 
[01:47:30]  Come on.  That's hilarious.  It's one of my favorites.  No, see...  Puts the mustache on and goes down on a date.  My era was...  You know, the only old show I watched was All in the Family.  Yeah.  And the new shows I watched was like Fresh Prince of Bel-Air and Beavis and Byers.  Hothead.  So I didn't really watch the Brady Bunch.  You don't know what you're missing, though.  I'm missing the moral of the story, which I'm absolutely not interested in.  No, like little underlying things.  I think he's happy.  I've got no Andy Griffith in her background.  Nothing?  He's got nothing.  She doesn't...  No Opie.  Oh, he's 20. 
[01:48:00]  I think Christopher Knight's just happy that he can talk about something else besides the  Brady Bunch finally, right?  I think he really does.  Yeah, actually, I mean, it's...  You know, I'll talk about whatever, but if people find the Brady Bunch still interesting...  I'll hang.  I'll hang.  But you've got to be like Barry.  35 years later, I don't know what else I can say.  Barry was so sick of talking about the Brady Bunch.  You finally got another hit show, so people are just focusing on this more.  They know where he came from, obviously.  It's nice to have something else to talk about.  Yeah, it must be.  I like that people now know his name a little bit more, because when we did this real life, 
[01:48:30]  we'd walk down the street, and they'd be like, hey, it's the supermodel, which I'm not offended of.  And, oh, look, it's Peter Brady.  Peter Brady.  Oh, my God.  Dude, every...  It's on your board that way.  Ah, it is?  On your calendar.  You have a great real name.  It's like a porn star name.  Christopher Knight.  Tell him your real porn star name.  Christopher Knight.  Dickens Ledwell.  Yeah.  Wow, that's a good one.  Mine's Mink Mink Pandola.  Very good.  When's the movie coming?  One Night in Curry?  I don't know.  Yeah, that ain't gonna come out. 
[01:49:00]  That's like, dude, every day, though, right?  Every day of your life for 35 years has been, hey, Peter Brady.  Hey, it's got him to score a lot.  Well, I don't doubt it, but it's just iconic.  Remember when Barry finally looked at us and said, my name's Barry?  Yeah, could you stop?  Hey, Greg.  Yo, Greg.  Greg.  We're now hanging out a little bit.  Could you call me by my real name?  Yeah.  Sorry, dude.  So is this relationship for real, or is it for TV? 
[01:49:30]  No, that's real.  Oh, we absolutely just fake everything.  I'll ask, though, because the whole Flavor Flav thing, they came in as like, this is so  fake for TV.  It was obvious.  She was engaged.  But look, look, look.  We're attractive people who are attracted to each other, and I don't know.  That relationship was just really crazy.  She had a fiance.  But they weren't living with each other.  We've been living with each other since, like, January 2nd of this year.  I thought you were trying to kick her out.  Yeah.  Yeah, it wasn't really successful.  He wanted his boyfriend to move in.  Let me ask you a question. 
[01:50:00]  I'm realizing in this relationship, I am not going to get what it is I want.  Anything you want.  No, you're not.  That's pretty typical, isn't it?  Yeah.  Oh, please.  And that's why this relationship will work.  Oh, you're getting what you want.  Listen to me.  Yesterday was...  The world weeps for him.  He sleeps with a 23-year-old girl that's in the dominatrix.  Look, and I've sort of engineered a weapon where I lose like this.  The sympathy in this room is overwhelming.  It's overwhelming.  You really want your cake and eat it, too, don't you, you ass?  He does.  Exactly.  He's basically like...  Most of us are fucking fours.  And you...  I'm actually...  We have sex with who we are. 
[01:50:30]  Okay?  And look at her.  She's amazing.  That's a little too deep.  I would...  We have sex with who we are.  Oh, he's deep, all right.  I'm really deep.  I fuck sinks.  Okay, Chris?  He's had sex with a sink.  Can we say the F word?  Yeah.  Satellite radio.  Oh, fuck.  There we go.  Fucking fabulous.  Yes, it's satellite radio.  The age difference is what?  23?  Five years.  25 years?  God bless you, dude.  God bless you.  Seriously, man.  God bless you.  It has no effect.  On what?  Only for him.  The age difference.  Only for him. 
[01:51:00]  He's extremely anal retentive and very set in his way.  You don't have to mind your manners here like you should have when you were Phil Packer  in the restaurant kissing when your father had a big business client sitting in a booth  getting repulsed by the kissing that was going on.  There was a little fondling.  There was some fondling.  It was awful, but you know, you don't have to be like that here.  It was un-very-brady.  Nice.  Sorry.  Very nice.  I get that.  That was a sexy episode.  The Phil Packer episode. 
[01:51:30]  More sex on that whole show.  This Halloween, you're going to go into the kitchen and change costumes and go back at nothing?  Nothing.  Okay.  Hey!  It was awful.  Jesus Christ.  So your parents happy with the age difference and all that?  I ask because I'm going through a similar thing and it took a long time.  My dad was not happy at first, but I convinced him to not kill him and it didn't happen.  My mom is not happy with him. 
[01:52:00]  He's a year older than my mother.  Your dad and mom grew up watching him on television.  Actually, my mom didn't watch very much TV.  No, they're very poor, so...  Wait, you're a year older than her mom?  Apparently.  Okay.  Oh, my God.  I got a very similar thing.  Same month of birth, too.  I'm still working on the mom in my relationship.  What's the deletion between...  Don't tell her what he told my mom.  Give me some advice.  He told my mom this.  I'll marry your daughter when her communication skills catch up with her sexual skills. 
[01:52:30]  Oh, no, or your communication skills catch up with your sexuality.  No, he said sexual skills.  I don't know what that really meant, but I was drunk at the time.  Yeah, that's probably not a good thing to say to the parents.  I'm thinking it was...  And I get along with my mother more than I do my father, so he impressed my dad, who  we hardly talk, but it totally ruined self of my mommy.  Now I'm playing golf with my girlfriend's father.  I'm in now.  Oh, really?  I still got to work on the mom a little bit, but...  Oh, yeah.  How many years between you?  About 17.  Okay.  I thought 17 was a lot. 
[01:53:00]  You guys are 25.  Man.  How old is your girlfriend?  She's 22, 23.  Yeah.  Oh, maybe we can have some coffee to walk.  She's going to be 23 soon.  Go out and talk.  She's got to set up a little couple.  Is she hot?  I set up a club.  His girlfriend?  I'm ridiculous.  Ridiculous.  Okay, how about me and her go out for lunch, and you guys can go hang out somewhere?  But I have to say this every time, too.  She's got an unbelievable personality and a sense of humor, too.  Is she bisexual?  No.  Not all women.  Are you?  What? 
[01:53:30]  You're going to, like, clam up now?  No, no.  I'm just thinking about what I'm going to do to your girlfriend.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  She's on her way from Philly.  She wanted to meet you guys.  All hot women.  All hot women are gay.  No, I'm sorry.  But unless you love a man, you're not going to really be attracted to him.  Women are soft, supple.  They smell good.  And we know how to believe each other better than a man does.  Yeah, but what about those cooties?  That's, uh...  Yeah. 
[01:54:00]  Girl, cooties?  Women are good villagers.  They like living in the village together.  I wish I could make a mattress out of breath.  Is that it?  That they sleep together to, you know, maintain village order.  Wouldn't a boob mattress be fabulous?  What are you, Buffalo Bill?  No.  No, just have, like, a realistic boob.  It takes a village.  For a mattress.  She'd ruin me in the hips.  You've got tape, you know, working that outfit?  I had to.  All right.  Yeah.  You'd be flying out of that.  We're all open.  Why did you have to ask that, Opie?  Because you just ruined it for me.  Because you're thinking what I'm thinking.  The whole show that it might slip out. 
[01:54:30]  Now I know it's not going to happen.  That's what's great about those type of...  She's got one of those scoop...  I don't...  What is it called?  It's a sweeping, swooping neckline.  It's a very, very swoopy, like, almost down to my belly button.  It's down to my belly button.  It's very, like, light material.  It's Gucci.  It's very, very light.  And it's barely brushing against her breasts.  The whole middle is...  Look at the...  Wow.  Wow.  Yeah.  That's amazing.  And, like I said, the world weeps for Chris for being able to tap it.  Yeah.  A tap it.  Too bad for you, dude. 
[01:55:00]  Wow.  I really feel bad for you, dude.  I don't have to do much in this relationship.  Just sit back and just let her go.  Who knew you had game, bro?  Come on.  You have to stay in shape, dude.  You have to...  You better not wind up like me.  I don't care if he gets fat.  As long as there's Viagra involved.  Oh, my God.  Are you really, sir?  I think a guy, as long as his arms stay nice and fit, I like guts.  I like guts.  There you go.  Yeah, you have nice arms.  Yeah, Robert, try a little harder.  I got these...  Robert's over there trying to flex just in case. 
[01:55:30]  No, I just gotta get...  Hang on one second.  I gotta get my...  As long as you feel protected by your man, it's fine.  Why don't you show her your gut?  My gut?  Yeah, she doesn't mind if Chris gets fat.  Look at his underwear hanging out from...  What if Chris does shimmy my elastic on my underwear up like a girdle?  Hang on.  Yeah.  Watch.  If Chris had a gut like this, would you still be going out of him?  Chris, Chris, could you not look at me like that and disgust him?  I'm sort of disgusted.  Yeah.  Hey, hey.  But then again, I don't have to appreciate you.  Adrian, what do you think?  Hang on one second.  Hold on.  Here comes the gut.  Hang on one second.  Hang on one second.  All right.  He's getting prepared for that. 
[01:56:00]  He's a drama queen.  Hang on one second.  So, you know, supposedly, Chris got the...  He's got the washboard, right?  Hang on one second.  What if Chris has got...  Could you guys turn your heads in the back, please?  Stop giggling and make...  It's really embarrassing.  Like, this isn't enough?  What if he started looking like this?  Go ahead, Bob.  I'm not even...  Oh, Jesus.  That's not bad.  Actually, I would prefer Chris like that just because he only has, like, three hairs on  his chest and, like, three hairs on his...  Hang on.  Before you say it's not bad, let me just turn sideways, okay?  Here we go.  Can you make it roll?  Your torso shouldn't look...  No, but I can make it look like a little African starving baby. 
[01:56:30]  Look.  Dude, your torso should never look like a smiley face.  Jump up and down.  Dude, I tore my ACL.  Oh, yeah.  I broke my knee, dude.  What do you want me to do?  That was over a year ago.  Are you starving, Marvin, from South Park?  Yeah.  The little Ethiopian boy.  I got a little chunk.  I'm sorry.  So, what's up with the dominatrix thing?  Yeah, on the show.  I like to be in control.  The poor guy's passed out after the thing, you guys...  How dare he?  He's trying to make up for my Valentine's Day, tells me to move out, and then doesn't want 
[01:57:00]  to score with me?  He's so cold on the bed, and you're pulling his pants down, and whipping him, and spanking  him.  I didn't pull his pants down.  I spanked the hell out of him.  How dare he go to sleep?  What's wrong with you?  Wake up.  Peter.  He's going to kill you, man.  Of course he is.  No, I was really...  Every time you play that, I see his eyes go, ugh.  I was really upset, because on Valentine's Day, when I had planned a Valentine's Day for  him and treated him like a king, I serviced him for like two hours.  Wow.  I love that word, service.  Service. 
[01:57:30]  I serviced him for like hours.  The hood's up, the oil's changed.  And then, you know, he...  Yeah, it makes it sound like it's one way.  Right.  Yeah.  No, it was.  I told you, lay down.  I tied down your arms and stuff.  That was one way.  You couldn't move.  But anyway, yeah, you remember that.  Don't even lie.  I blindfolded you, too.  And so I figured, since we went out to eat, and he decided to totally shove his foot in  his mouth and ruin the whole night for me, I should at least get laid.  Really?  How dare you go to sleep? 
[01:58:00]  Yeah.  You know, I thought I was being pretty nice for giving him, for telling me to get the  hell out of his house on my Valentine's Day makeup dinner.  Might as well get some cock.  Jesus.  You can say fuck, but you can't say cock on me.  You can say cock.  I'm kidding.  I was going to say why.  Because we really want to hear it from you.  Let me say the cock.  Girthy penis.  Is that better?  No, cock is better.  You know, some days, it was a mentally exhausting day.  No, it wasn't.  And if you could just...  You just kept drinking champagne, stupid.  And if you could just...  If you were into morning sex... 
[01:58:30]  You're not into morning sex?  Your breath smells so bad in the morning and so gassy.  Oh, Jesus.  I don't want to have sex.  He'd be like pumping and going...  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  We'd be halfway through.  I have to poop now.  You always have to poop right in the morning.  I don't want to have sex with someone who's full of poop.  We don't want to hear this about Peter Brady?  Yeah.  That is so perfect.  Peter Brady's perfect.  That is just...  Peter Brady's a fictional 13-year-old character with an afro.  All right.  Right here is the stud bump.  He just had curly hair.  And he's got the bad breath in the morning. 
[01:59:00]  You know what?  Another family used to call him Lion King.  They did not.  And I'm tired of you saying that.  They called my friend that.  You say it.  Well, I have a fucking baseball.  Wait, what's that about?  What does that mean?  Liar.  No.  Liar.  Excuse me.  Excuse me.  Storyteller.  You're a storyteller?  I'm going to fuck you up.  Oh, big storyteller.  Oh, she's going to hit him.  No, seriously.  My best friend was a fucking liar and always lied to my parents to have us go out and stuff.  And she was an ex-girlfriend of mine.  So we'd always lie about everything because we were little lesbians.  And they called her Liza Minnelli, Lion King. 
[01:59:30]  That's funny.  And he sits there and he says the story's about me because he's fucking old and he forgets  everything.  Everybody exaggerates everything.  There's a shred of truth and everybody's exaggerating every story they tell.  And they're just smack talking everywhere.  I'd never treat you like this is all I'm saying.  I don't think you lie.  I don't think you lie.  And I think you're an honest person.  And you come from the heart.  I'm very honest.  Everything comes out.  I have no barrier.  That's what I think.  Your boobs aren't coming out, though.  And that's what they want.  I don't want that.  Chris, I don't want that. 
[02:00:00]  Oh, what was that?  Speak for yourself, Robert.  If there's one thing we've learned, it's honesty.  Bill Burr would want to see the boobs.  As a matter of fact, you weren't able to go on a camping trip because you lied to your  father.  Actually, you told the truth at the end.  But as I recall, Mr. Kramer still drove off without you.  And the most important thing was what?  The truth.  I'm lost.  At the end of the episode, he looked and went, the truth.  Oh, you're talking about the Brady Bones.  Of course I am.  I didn't know what you were talking about. 
[02:00:30]  There's a lot of life lessons that you've missed.  Yeah.  See?  And that's what I'm trying to get to.  Right.  My life lessons is how Greg can fuck his mom and how you can tap Jan.  He never did.  I never did.  I missed that.  Liar.  What's up with Mrs.  You at least did the whole.  No, that's the truth.  What's up with Mrs. Brady?  She's an actual therapist?  No, she's not.  She's a hypnotherapist.  She just said that he finger popped Jan.  She just licked her fingers.  That is so hot.  Pre-braces or post-braces? 
[02:01:00]  I think it was...  Was it by the craft services?  No, I'm thinking it was an accident.  He might have been in the carport when she was riding her bike without the glasses.  And then she fell off the bike and fell right onto your fingers.  Now that...  It's going to kill me.  They're having a little conference.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  What did I do?  No, nothing.  Nothing.  Are you going to lay into me now?  No.  No, I'm not.  He basically just told me to stop pretending like he's scarred with somebody who's too hot  for him.  Oh.  Yeah, that's what I said. 
[02:01:30]  Eve didn't want to do you.  She wanted to do someone really hot.  Really?  Yeah.  He was a little kid.  They were both little kids.  Did you see him?  He was scrawny until like age 23.  He looked like he was 12.  He was the one, though, that came out of the whole thing in the best shape.  Like all of a sudden you were doing soap operas and guys, you'd tune in like chicks were  tuning in and going, wow.  You know, Peter Brady, of course.  But, you know, you kind of had something going after that.  The other guys were all...  Well, thanks.  Well, you did.  Kind of, just a little bit. 
[02:02:00]  Was that a con of it?  It's very...  To me, it looked like it was very difficult to kind of come out of that whole thing.  You came out of it like...  I didn't know you were running an independent Brady meter.  I thought I'm gay.  I am.  I am the Brady expert.  He used to challenge Barry and would win all the time.  He knew more about the Brady Bunch than Barry would.  He and my sister would have a competition when the episode would start.  Who could tell what the plot line was just from a split second of...  Name that episode.  Was it really that good of a show? 
[02:02:30]  Oh, it rolled.  Yeah, it rolled.  It was the only show we watched growing up.  I just thought it was for, like, just six-year-olds.  Yeah, it was.  What can I tell you?  His whole life is based around it.  She goes, it's really that good of a show?  His whole life is based from running from it.  Can I ask you a question?  I look at you where you live now on the show that you're doing now, and what did you do  before this show and before Surreal Life?  What did you do for work?  Did you act?  Rob Banks?  He's a jiggler. 
[02:03:00]  What were you?  I was in high tech.  I was in the computer industry for 20 years.  And now you're retired.  Wow.  I decided to take some time away from the desk.  That's great.  Yeah, because it got a little claustrophobic.  No, that lived through the go-go 90s and then to the crushing, you know, later years  of the high tech industry where things imploded.  Not that I was in anything internet, but nonetheless, it had an effect across the board.  Right.  Just about the time things imploded.  The fun sort of drained out of it for me.  I needed to recharge. 
[02:03:30]  And you were married in all that?  Not all of it, but a good part of it, yeah.  Part of it?  You were married for a while there?  Yeah.  Twice.  Did you get raked?  Twice.  You got married twice?  Oh, no.  No kids?  No, I actually didn't get buried.  Yeah.  He buried them.  Nice.  He buried himself in them.  No, I'm sorry.  Can't help yourself, can you?  No.  I like that I can say whatever the fuck I want here.  This is funny.  Adrienne is the most sexual person.  Wow. 
[02:04:00]  Yeah.  I just like to fuck.  See, there's, she's lying again.  You guys want to have sex now?  I'll just sit around and watch.  No, when is your girlfriend getting here?  Yeah.  We have a wiffle ball bet.  When's your girlfriend getting here, man?  Let's see if I got to communique.  No, no communiques coming in, so.  What do your friends think?  You know, older guy, guy that played Peter.  Um, a lot of my friends at first were really disgusted with me.  Really?  Well, because I had sworn off men.  Disgusted?  What were they?  I had sworn off men for, no.  Oh, right, right, right. 
[02:04:30]  They were disgusted that you were the man.  Yeah.  Well, because I have a lot of feminist, lesbian friends, and they're like, how dare you?  And then they, you know, I kept telling them about him, and they saw him on TV, and  they're like, wow, well, he's pretty charismatic and attractive.  And I'm like, yeah, he's a really sweet guy.  He's not just your typical, you know, joysy asshole.  They were mad that they weren't going to get you anymore.  That's why.  Probably.  Yeah.  I'm not going to do that whole little finger thing that you did before.  She made the sound effect this time. 
[02:05:00]  And you guys are still living together?  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Second season coming, or no?  What are you giggling about?  Just her.  What are you giggling about?  She just cracks me up.  Why is that?  Why is it constantly cracks me up?  Why is she adorable?  You got to admit it.  She might lie through her teeth, but she's adorable.  I am not lying.  Don't call her a liar.  What is she lying about?  She turns into Bobby when you...  I am not lying.  No, I get so offended by it, because you always tell me you're the most honest woman I've  ever been with.  I really like your honesty. 
[02:05:30]  And then whenever we're around people and I say something true, like you like to be spanked  or have your nipples pinched, you're like, oh, she's a big liar.  You know, Chris...  You're a shit-talker.  You are.  Chris, you've got to let her be herself.  Now, you knew when you tried to change your personality how poorly that went.  You tried to be like Humphrey Bogart, pork chops and applesauce.  That personality didn't work.  And finally, in the end, we realized just being yourself is really what was important.  And telling the truth. 
[02:06:00]  And telling the truth.  What are you grabbing?  You've got to do both.  Of course.  I was like, what are you grabbing down there?  She leaned over and kind of held.  Yeah.  It looked like you were grabbing your penis.  I think the tape's starting to wear off.  Fans hyperventilating, trying to blow into the shirt to puff it up.  Yeah, that's wonderful.  No, it's still working.  Damn it.  So how is this relationship going to end?  Who invented tape?  Kill them.  It's double-sided tape.  Kill the tape inventor. 
[02:06:30]  That George Washington Carver.  Kill somebody.  Mr. Scotch.  Mr. Scotch.  That's what it is.  It's double-sided Scotch tape.  Thank you, Scotch.  So where does the relationship go from here?  Ask him.  Does it have staying power?  No, it's got staying power.  Are you going to be making out with any of her friends?  Missed the big man?  Has she done that there for you?  No.  Oh, he did it to her.  What?  He made out with a friend, the lesbian go-go girl.  That was just...  You gave her a tongue, you creep.  No, let's not go there.  She's still pissed off about that.  No, I'm not.  I have absolutely no comment on this. 
[02:07:00]  What are we talking about?  They were at a party, and the girl from the go-go...  Jane Weedley.  Oh, oh.  Yeah, but she's...  It was a birthday party, and it was a joke.  Well, it is a woman who told me that she wanted you and got very mad and jealous even when  she was married, that I had you, and she didn't.  Oh.  So it would be a joke if it was with someone who wasn't unbelievably attracted to you and  wanted to ride your cock, but it wasn't.  And yeah.  Yeah, and you closed your eyes when you gave her the tongue, too. 
[02:07:30]  So that's, you know, you did that shit.  You closed your eyes.  So he wanted it, right?  Yeah, he wanted...  You seen passion in his eyelids when he closed it, and mwah.  I remember that.  And then you touched her side.  You're a very insightful man.  Yeah.  I did.  I watched it.  And you're starting more problems.  I'm trying to break them up right now.  No.  I know.  She said she likes fat guys.  I'm all over it.  All they have to do is have triceps.  I can do dips every day.  You're not fat.  And who knew you dated Cindy Margolis?  Now, the problem here is that you're wearing a Boston hat.  She hates that.  Yeah.  You think I wouldn't trade in the red side? 
[02:08:00]  I'd be a Yankee fan tomorrow if you tell me.  Good boy.  For you.  Well, I'm not that young.  What about a Cubs fan?  I'll be a Cubs fan.  I'll watch women's lesbian softball if that's what you're doing.  Well, you can watch me in the lingerie ball.  Super Bowl?  Yeah.  Where contractually they have to let their clothes fall away.  No.  And do nothing about it.  No.  Unless they pay me more money, I'm going in the fetal position.  Are we going to see you in Playboy or anything?  I'm sure those offers are coming in.  There's been offers for a lot of things. 
[02:08:30]  Yeah?  Yeah.  Mostly gay porn.  You guys should make a video.  For you or Christmas?  One Night in Curry.  One Night in Curry.  Nothing.  Nothing.  Nothing.  She wasn't listening, that's all.  She wasn't listening.  I know.  It's the audience you play for.  There's three or four different conversations going on at all times.  You know who did do, a lot of young stars do gay porn.  They do.  The guy from The Toy.  The kid from The Toy.  He did porn.  Yeah.  The kid from Fright Night.  Yeah, he did some. 
[02:09:00]  He actually became more famous in gay porn than he was in movies.  Congratulations to him.  Wonderful.  What a great gig.  I don't know how I know all this.  Are you following gay porn?  Is that how you know all this?  You have to keep up on the industry.  He knows everything about pornography.  He's following all the stories.  I'm a little freaky in case my chick wants to get down.  I'll be there for her.  I'll let her tie me up and I won't fart in the morning.  Oh, Lord.  You talk about porn just reminded me.  The other day we're watching this porno.  We're about to get it on, you know, trying to get in the mood.  And I look up and my ex-roommate from when I lived in New York City is, like, sitting 
[02:09:30]  there just sticking it to this chick.  And it was such a fucking...  Your ex-roommate was in the movie?  Yeah.  This guy.  And he's an editor.  That's fine.  How do you do?  Yeah, he edits porn.  But he lied to me.  He said he was never in it.  And then I'm, like, watching him.  And he's this skinny, scrawny, ugly dude.  And I'm just like, oh.  And he had this, like, 12-inch penis.  Yeah.  Remember that?  I'm like, oh, my God.  It's, uh, what's his name?  She sounded very excited when she said 12-inch penis, by the way.  He wasn't in Rome, was he?  No, it was disgusting.  It looked like it was a third leg, because he's so skinny. 
[02:10:00]  You want to see my favorite porno?  Yeah.  Our favorite porno?  I personally like Sex and the Shitty.  This is our favorite.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  This is our favorite.  Century Sex.  Century Sex.  Do you really get to see this chick at port?  Yeah, but she lied.  She's only 87.  That's actually Ann B. Davis.  As the Century Sex woman.  No?  Dude, she's a Christian lady.  I know.  She's very nice.  See, this chick isn't so hideous, but this, oh, this looks like this guy went into a nursing 
[02:10:30]  home and just, yeah, started plowing up.  Look at her boobs.  They're like, they're like withered leaves falling off an autumn tree.  That's not going to happen.  I'm never going to, I'm going to puke.  Yeah.  All right, we got some phone calls coming in.  Let's say hi to Pat in Boston.  Pat, what's up?  Hey, boys.  Hey.  Two-part question.  I wanted to know who does the laundry, because if I remember, a young Christopher has trouble  with the laundry. 
[02:11:00]  And I want to know if any robes got ruined back in the day when Chris overloaded the laundry  with detergent.  Unfortunately, that wasn't Peter, that was Bobby that had problems with the laundry.  See, you got to keep it straight, my friend.  I blew it.  Punch.  He was trying.  Yeah.  Rob in Miami.  Rob?  Hey, how you doing, guys?  All right, Rob.  Hey, Chris.  You know, I saw the show the other day, and I see why you're dating this chick.  But the other 23 hours a day when you're not banging her, how have you not gouged your 
[02:11:30]  eyes out with a spoon?  She is the same reason I haven't gouged your eyes out.  She is ignorant.  Good God.  Gee.  That's cold.  Defend me.  I'm your woman.  Defend me, you fucking prick.  That's all he said was, that's cold, dude.  Defend me, you fucking prick.  Jesus Christ.  Well, what fucking kind of man is that?  I'll defend you, you motherfucker.  You don't talk to her like that, you redneck son of a bitch. 
[02:12:00]  I'll kill you.  I'll kill your fucking family.  I'll stab you in the throat, you cocksucker.  It would be all right if you could bang her and let the air out of her and put her back  in your drawer.  She's all the way.  Hey, what supermodel are you fucking, darling?  Hey, there you go.  There you go.  She's getting all upset.  Let me comment on.  I'm not getting upset.  Let me calm you down a little bit.  Just tell the guy to fuck off.  That's all.  Birds never sang before.  Flowers never grew.  I have no idea.  Ponies never ran before.  Oh, my God. 
[02:12:30]  Till I met you.  You're a ball at him.  Yeah, he does.  He just threw a baseball at my head.  He's had it.  I could have fucking hurt him.  I could have thrown it harder.  Oh, is that classic?  Oh, Christopher.  Christopher just threw a baseball at my head.  He hit him in the neck.  Thank you.  He's not at it, man.  He couldn't make it anymore.  That is not nice.  He was trying to throw it.  I didn't want to break the window.  Perfectly acceptable.  I didn't throw it hard.  For singing that lousy song.  He was trying to calm you down, though. 
[02:13:00]  I was already calmed down.  All he had to do was tell the guy, fuck off.  Don't make me break into makeshift Model T.A.  You have to throw a baseball at Anthony's trachea.  Jesus.  I'm tired, man.  I'm sorry, but that was some funny shit.  It's lost on her, but I hear you.  Chris, what do you have to say about that guy that was on the phone?  Oh, he's just some random.  You know, how do you respond to that?  I mean, some things aren't worth responding to.  The fact is that our relationship is multi-layered, and there's, you know, a lot of it edited  out for the show.  To think that everything is to, you know, be mistaken. 
[02:13:30]  And Adrienne is a little over the top at times, but she's also the sweetest, you know, kindest  and the most loyal person I've ever met.  And scene.  Ugh!  Sorry.  I hate him.  Oh, George Bush.  Die!  Die, Jesus.  I don't like it.  He will.  Someone's going to assassinate me.  Oh, boy.  Here we go.  Oh, boy.  Don't say that.  We're going to get a visit.  It's going to be Greg Brady.  No, I'm kidding.  We're going to get a visit.  We're going to get a visit now.  She's got really bad karma.  I don't like any politician. 
[02:14:00]  I'm sorry.  So sue me.  They're all liars.  They will.  She loves heaping bad crap coming to herself.  Hey, let's quickly change the subject.  Let's say hi to Mike in Jersey.  Mike?  Hello, Mike in Jersey.  Hey.  Good morning, boys.  Hey.  I don't know this chick's in the ass sex.  Oh, Jesus.  What is this?  Ass sex.  Anal.  Oh, that.  Anal.  I just bought a book called The Beginner's Guide to Anal Sex, and I bought a little, it's  called Little Ride, a little bottle plug.  Can you believe this book?  And it's got like 90 pages in it.  I mean, what could you be talking about for 90 pages?  I'm trying to learn a lot of women. 
[02:14:30]  I haven't done it yet.  It's her way of stalling.  She just wants to read about it.  No, it's just all my friends told me.  Well, it took about a good 13 times before I enjoyed it.  13.  13 is the lucky number on that one.  This guy is girthy.  He doesn't have some small little prick that I'd be comfortable with, okay?  I'm a little scared.  Yeah.  So I have to read the book.  What you've got to do is get your knees and put it right into your stomach.  Oh, that's so wrong.  That helps for you, Bob.  Wait a minute.  What am I talking about?  I don't know. 
[02:15:00]  That's what I've heard through the internet forum.  Well, I can do that through my mouth, you know?  Jesus Christ.  I'm in love with her.  Wow.  Stanley Cain's here.  Oh, no.  Just showing that God has a sense of humor, man.  Look at the fucking...  If you don't think God has a sense of humor, man, you mix the DNA one way and you get this  lovely creature that's in the studio and then you mix it another way and look at the horror  show outside the studio right now.  Yeah, they are 99.9% the same. 
[02:15:30]  The same.  All right, a few phone calls coming in.  Let's say hi to Carl.  What's up, Carl?  Hey, how you doing?  All right.  I just wanted to know if Chris Knight, did he come up with that Valentine's Day episode  for the show?  Was that scripted?  No, most of the stuff is not.  It was suggested to him because he's not that romantic.  Well, I mean, the fact is that I needed to do something to make up for the kiss.  Man, I was crying, bro.  It was great.  Oh, good.  Good.  Yeah, I kind of screwed it up late in the night.  Are you going to shoot steroids in a future episode like good old Danny? 
[02:16:00]  No, we leave that to Danny.  We leave that to Danny.  Holy crap.  Let him slit his wrist, shoot the steroids.  Hey, Danny's a nice guy even though he's a little crazy.  Yeah, absolutely.  Yeah, he's out of his mind.  You going to throw a baseball at him too?  We got a guy.  Yeah, a little anger management.  I'm so sorry he did that to you.  That's so sad.  I deserved it.  I've never seen him do anything like that.  See the way he just looked at me?  He looked at me for a second and, ugh, he was going to throw something on my face.  I don't have a ball then.  We got a guy named Buddy Hinton on the line. 
[02:16:30]  Buddy Hinton.  Oh, no.  Buddy, what's up?  The only violence in the Brady Bunch, right?  Right.  True.  Yeah.  You remember me?  Baby talk, baby talk.  It's no wonder you can walk.  That girl sitting next to you there, I'm going to bang her someday while listening to Time  to Change.  You shut up, Buddy Hinton.  You got something in your hand right now?  What are you doing?  Okay, good.  He's got nothing.  Hey, man.  He's got nothing.  Considering Chris is the first guy I've banged in three years, I highly doubt that.  I'll be a lesbian after you. 
[02:17:00]  They're much better.  Wow.  Are you going to go back to girls eventually?  If he screws this up, probably.  See, it's all in my hands.  All in your hands.  Why is it all his fault?  No, it's not.  I don't think that's a, I mean, what is that?  A fate worse than death to sleep with women?  No.  Why, as you said, if he doesn't screw with a relationship?  Because I was never really into men before.  No, never?  I have a feeling you're going to screw up this relationship.  I think you're going to screw up.  Call me crazy, but I have a feeling that it's not going to be good old Christopher Knight 
[02:17:30]  that messes this one up.  I treat my baby like a king, don't I?  Yes, you do.  Give me a favor.  Check under the pillow for an ice pick.  Believe me.  Last night, she starts pummeling.  I feel like I'm in the corner with Oscar De La Liga.  I've never done that.  I was sleeping.  And all of a sudden, she's just beating on my chest.  I had a dream Patrick Swayze was trying to steal my food.  I'm not kidding.  And, of course, when I heard that, then I understood.  It made all the sense in the world.  I don't like that.  Because you don't want Patrick Swayze stealing my food.  I've had that same dream. 
[02:18:00]  Stealing your food?  I had lasagna, and he was all like, it was the end of the world, and I had the only food.  End of the world, okay, sure.  And Val Kilmer was there, and I had to feed him enough.  And then here comes Patrick Swayze trying to steal my food.  Nobody puts Brady in a corner.  No?  I didn't mean to.  I woke up.  I felt so bad.  Funny line, if you know that stupid movie.  Because normally, he's the one that kicks me around.  I'm sorry, baby.  All right.  That's all right.  They're making up now, so it's all good, right?  Thank goodness.  You didn't hurt me.  Ben, were you all right on time?  You guys having fun?  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[02:18:30]  Yeah, sure.  I want McDonald's after this.  As long as I keep my mouth shut.  I'm so sorry to throw a baseball game.  It was okay.  I was shocked.  I've never seen any sort of, like...  It hit my arm.  It was high and tight.  It hit you right here, dude.  It hit you in the jugular.  That's all right.  It kind of rolled up my arm.  You got Sunshine Day there?  It's Sunshine Day.  Everybody's smiling.  Sunshine Day.  Everybody's laughing.  Sunshine Day.  Everybody needs...  Everybody... 
[02:19:00]  Someone's laughing at you.  ...seemed so happy today?  I can't remember.  I don't either.  You think I know?  You were the only one that couldn't sing, right?  Yeah.  And I still can't.  No, he can, too.  He's a great baritone.  It was the time to change.  Yeah, it was the time to change.  I changed the whole song for him.  Yeah, they had the...  Oh, no.  Yeah.  It was the time to change.  Have you heard this one yet?  No?  That's Barry.  Is that Greg?  Yeah.  Ah!  It's not just season. 
[02:19:30]  You know, it goes for everything.  Oh, you guys sing some gay music.  Hold on.  This part's coming up, Maureen.  Yeah.  Do you smell bongs with some music?  Not yet.  Oh.  Oh, it's kind of cute.  It's kind of cute, isn't it?  I've got to wait for, you know, the Peter part, though. 
[02:20:00]  I don't think you're going to hear it.  Because this is from the CD, right?  Studio version.  Studio version doesn't have it.  Only episode version.  Damn it.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  Day by day, it's hard to see.  Did you guys actually sell out?  Barry really tried.  Yeah.  Barry really was selling it.  He sold a few.  Barry was selling it.  Yeah.  It's kind of cute.  It's like something I think I'd watch, like, when I was in my Barney, or listen to when I was in my Barney days.  It's cute.  She watched Barney.  She had Barney days.  She went from Barney right to Beavis and Barney. 
[02:20:30]  Well, I'm into like Nine Inch Nails and Tool, so I don't think that...  I love Tool.  Oh, Tool fucking rules.  The other day, I put it on and he's like, what's this fucking noise?  I said, how dare you?  Get out of my car.  Do you like the Tool?  Nah.  Tool is all right.  What a freak.  What kind of music do you like, Derek?  He doesn't like any.  Like, I'm sitting there jamming to Pink Floyd and he tells me to turn it down.  Led Zeppelin, turn it down.  The doors, turn it down.  Get out of my car.  What do you listen to?  Like Tony Robbins?  I think.  No, I don't think.  Oh, you don't like music?  I know.  He likes to throw on a silver platter's disc every so often. 
[02:21:00]  The silver platter.  It's too loud.  I love listening to Johnny Bravo.  Johnny Bravo.  Sure.  Let's say hi to Dan in Connecticut.  Dan, what's up?  So sorry, Chris.  Dan.  Hey, what's up, Dan?  Yeah, I thought maybe Anthony could play the Marsha Brady song for Peter.  Let him know how much he really loved the show.  The Marsha Brady song?  Yeah, that was the Marsha Brady song.  What's the Marsha Brady song?  It's just a song that I penned with my old band from many years ago. 
[02:21:30]  I've got to hear it.  It was about Marsha.  Yeah.  All right.  We can play a little of this.  All right.  But the heat she created for you?  Oh, yeah.  Absolutely.  Well, all I hear all day long in school is how great Marsha is at this or how wonderful  Marsha did that.  Marsha, Marsha, Marsha.  Marsha, Marsha, Marsha.  Anthony on lead vocals.  Oh, thank you.  Okay.  Looking at the screen.  What does this feeling mean?  I got that shiver way down deep in my loins.  Down deep.  Her blonde hair beauty.  And who ain't she a cutie? 
[02:22:00]  The best in every club that she joins.  She was the best, Molly.  She teases all the fellas.  Her little sister jealous.  Goddess from her head to her toes.  Well, she wears a grooving skirt with a flowered print shirt.  She's turning heads wherever she goes.  Yeah.  And all the things she does to me.  I, I, I got my very first boner watching Marsha Brady on a black and white Zenith TV. 
[02:22:30]  Black and white Zenith TV.  First boner.  She was hot, man.  Yeah.  I got my very first boner watching Marsha Brady.  One of the proudest moments of my life.  Billboard Junior High, her sparkling blue eyes.  The smile anyone to die for. 
[02:23:00]  Well, I almost shot my load at the Hawaiian episode.  When my miss thought he'd not eat on my door.  She's sweeter than a peach in her bikini on the beach.  The other girls couldn't compare.  Yeah, and what a piece of ass when she took that hula class.  Her skirt's so short, I think I saw her hair.  Oh, the things she does to me. 
[02:23:30]  You're in her virginity.  I, I, I, I, I got my very first boner watching Marsha Brady.  Yes, I did.  I got to get a copy of that.  What do you think?  You need a copy of that one?  I need a copy of that.  Because he agreed.  He got his very first boner.  Thank you, Chris.  She really was.  She's, she's, she's got so much power because she was everyone's first crush.  She was hot.  These are people running all the largest companies in America today. 
[02:24:00]  Right.  Right.  Back then, man, you watched that show and the blonde hair, the wholesome, the whole thing.  Oh, it's perfect.  She got it.  She's still hot now.  She looks exactly like she used to.  Slow down.  Let's say hi to Prozac.  She almost has.  She hasn't aged at all.  Oh, easy.  Let's say hi to Prozac.  Great interview, Proz.  Great interview.  I had a question for Christopher there.  Let me get this straight.  You're having sex and you got to take a morning shit with this hot chick?  What happened?  See, that was all shit talking. 
[02:24:30]  No, you take a morning shit every morning like three times in the morning.  Wow.  So what's that got to do with anything?  It's gross knowing you're doing something that's going to have to take a poo right when  you're done.  See, the thing is that she's got this gross thing.  It's not like I got to take a shit on her.  One more question.  She goes to the bathroom, yeah.  What's in her pants?  That's what I want to know.  What's in my pants?  What's in her pants?  What do you think there's a pin in her?  What kind of hairstyle?  I guess as far as a hairstyle, yeah.  It changes.  It changes.  Mostly nothing.  That's nice.  The wood floor we call it.  Right now I have a very, very thin landing strap. 
[02:25:00]  Oh, okay.  A Hitler mustache.  No, the Hitler mustache is when you shave it way down.  You have the line, but then you shave it down at that dot.  No, no, no.  I don't have a dot.  That doesn't make sense unless they're standing up with their legs together.  I do not have a Hitler mustache.  Sort of like the exclamation point without the dot.  Right.  Yeah, exactly.  It just hangs high.  It's about this long and about as thin as my pinky.  That's the mohawk, the landing strip.  Yeah.  She's got it.  Mohawk landing strip.  Yeah.  It's when you're drunk.  Put your cock there.  It could be a mohawk.  Oh, wow.  Exactly where to...  Adrian is the most beautiful woman everywhere. 
[02:25:30]  That's my favorite.  That's his favorite part of my body.  Wow.  Well, of course.  He prays it all the time.  No, he'll...  He wants to sit there and look at it.  It makes me uncomfortable.  She's a full...  Like a museum?  Absolutely real.  He just wants to look at it like it's a Picasso.  He wants to stare at your vagina like the pyramids?  Yeah.  Well, some girls tend to be a little messy down there.  I feel like it would be up on your cheek or something.  You know what?  I agree.  You don't want to mess down there.  There's some hacked memes somewhere.  Yeah, it looks like an explosion at the Steakums factory sometimes.  It looks like...  Ever see a man array just flowing through the sea?  Yeah, yeah. 
[02:26:00]  You don't want that.  You want it to look like a nice clamshell.  Yeah.  All...  I like that.  Everything self-contained.  I feel like Carl Sagan.  I appreciate her inner space like he did outer space.  There you go.  You unzip her pants.  It's like bat wings.  It flies across the room.  No, you don't need that.  That's nasty.  No, I appreciate you liking my body.  It's just...  I don't know.  Sometimes I get embarrassed.  You stare at it a lot.  Do you just stare at her ass?  He stares.  You got to lay down on the bed on her belly and what?  Do you just rub her ass?  She's...  You know, she's an athlete.  She's got... 
[02:26:30]  She's...  She's got muscle tone.  She's just...  She's well put together.  No, she's 22.  Wow.  Yeah, but you know something?  No, I'm in the gym six days a week.  Because there's a lot of fat 22-year-olds out there.  Yeah.  I mean...  You're right about that.  I'm not soft and skinny.  I am ripped everywhere.  I'm very proud of it.  And it takes a lot of hard work.  Well, you should be.  Well, we got to take leeks and dumps and stuff, so...  Ah, God damn great.  Yeah, it's morning for crying out loud.  Yeah, it is.  Like, I'm unusual.  You guys probably sleep till noon, right?  You all want to take dumps together?  Yeah, let's take dumps.  Let's all just line up in the stalls. 
[02:27:00]  He poops in front of me, but I haven't been able to poop in front of him.  Hold on, we talked about that.  I don't think that's good.  Let me ask you a question, Chris.  As far as the relationship goes.  My girl...  I have to...  The beginning of the...  You have a girl.  Dropping a deuce.  I'm surprised that you have a girl.  You have a girl.  He's such an asshole.  I love it.  You know what?  You learn nothing from the Brady Bunch.  Nothing.  You're a mean person.  I'm going to tell Florence.  I don't think Florence would appreciate your...  I'm going to tell Florence.  ...your vile sense of humor. 
[02:27:30]  Go ahead.  Now you're just making sure he won't steal me.  What is the problem in the morning?  Listen to me.  Hang on while I flex my muscles.  I...  My girl, I don't...  I can...  She can't be there at the beginning when I push it out and at the end when I wipe it out.  But she can be there in the middle.  In the middle, she can walk in and grab a little lipstick, grab a little Q-tip and come in and out.  Like, she wants to be there then.  That's when it smells the water.  Not that she hangs in there, but she'll come in and out.  But at the beginning, she's got to go.  She can't watch me get there, push it out. 
[02:28:00]  She doesn't want to hear the noises, but is it her problem or your problem?  What happens if she walks in at the beginning?  Does it go back?  I tell her to beat it.  Does it go back?  I tell her to beat it.  What happens if she did?  I tell her to beat it.  What happens if she did?  I get the fuck out of her.  I give you a fresh run.  Hold on.  That's what I say.  You learn how to talk to your woman, Chris.  Would you just hang there indefinitely if she would have stayed there?  Yeah.  I swear he wants me to see him poop.  Back himself up.  I mean, I told him.  I'm like, sometimes it's kind of unattractive to hear the kerplunk, kerplunk, kerplunk.  I don't know.  I don't like when you hear the sausage being pushed into the shell. 
[02:28:30]  I don't get what the big deal is.  And three in the morning.  I'm used to it now.  That's very healthy.  I'm used to it now.  I don't get what the big deal is.  But he started, like, after a week of dating, this man started pooping with the door open.  I was like, whoa, man.  Are we already there?  I pooped with the door open.  Because you never know when you need something.  That's the definition of anal retentiveness.  So what are we going to see on future episodes?  We should give the big plug here.  My fair Brady.  You're going to see...  VH1, Sunday nights at 9.30.  You're going to see him meet my 6'7 redneck father from Little Rock, Arkansas. 
[02:29:00]  Holy shit.  Are you kidding me?  Did he get drunk beforehand, hopefully?  No, but he got drunk with him.  Oh, that's good.  We went fishing.  That's a good bonding thing.  We went fishing and fishing.  And then my dad told you he'd kill you.  Yeah, and then I...  I got that speech to him.  Then I got drunk and frustrated with her mother and made her cry.  Oh, God.  You made her mother cry?  I'm not that I'm proud about that.  I still got a lot of work to do to make up for that.  Why'd you make her cry?  Well, we've got to wait to see, right?  You think I went in trying to make her cry?  And we go to Puerto Rico, where he tells me I have cellulite.  Right.  Oh, no. 
[02:29:30]  Where?  Are you crazy?  I would be more than happy to drop my pants and ask you if you think you see cellulite.  But I have to respect him.  Can I drop my pants?  Are you insane?  No.  Thanks.  You know what they call you in the business?  They call you a party pooper.  What about you?  It's my party.  Yeah, there you go.  It's his party.  And you are so not invited.  But you're supposed to invite friends to your party.  No.  It's a party in my pants, and I guess Christopher Knight is the only one that wants to be.  We were this close to seeing if she had cellulite.  Why'd you have to ask?  I don't have any. 
[02:30:00]  You don't have any.  I hardly even have skin on my bones.  She sent me up.  She says, Chris, is this cellulite?  And it wasn't.  Yeah.  And then, and then, you said everything.  You told me I asked.  I go, oh.  Watch, watch episodes of My Fair Brady, like the one that aired last night.  Of me scrubbing my car, and it's a full butt shot, and there is not one dent there.  Not one.  It's just, he got mad because.  Is it like you sat on a pebble, or is it like.  No, I started gaining a little weight, but it looked fabulous.  I got these big old boobs.  I finally had an ass.  And he likes Ethiopian women. 
[02:30:30]  He doesn't, he doesn't like real women.  It didn't look like cottage cheese.  No.  How tall are you?  I'm 5'11".  Wow.  And how much do you weigh?  How much do I weigh now?  Well, we could ask because you're.  1'32".  Yeah, that means she's perfect.  You're going to go to your chart, Opie?  You don't have to.  We just figured out that that works.  We have a chart then.  How much did you weigh during the cellulite moment?  During the cellulite moment.  Afterwards, I'll tell you, yeah, after that moment, later on, like a month later, I gained  weight.  But you know why?  I started that birth control that does that. 
[02:31:00]  But, and that's hormones.  You can't help it.  But I snapped back to it, and I started working out.  At the time, I weighed 140.  Ooh.  So I had bigger boobs.  I had like C cups.  They're fabulous.  Awesome.  This guy wanted bees.  Aw.  You're really a fucking picky guy.  Jesus.  Jesus.  You really don't settle for anything less, do you?  Yeah, but do you know, do you know what makes me happy?  What kind of self-help books have you been reading for the last 20 years?  Do you know what makes me happy?  He's lost a lot of muscle, and he has cute little love handles now, and it just really 
[02:31:30]  makes me happy.  Because I'm in the best shape.  He doesn't have.  No, he does.  I noticed it on the show.  You weren't as hot as you were on Surreal Life.  I, you know, I couldn't work out.  He's still fucking hot.  He's still fucking hot.  He's got to remember to eat at this point.  I mean, all he's got to do is look better than Mike.  All he's got to do is look good, period.  That's all he's got to do, as a Brady, is look better than Mike, and you're fine.  He's the best looking one, if you ask me.  He's aged the best out of all of them.  If you ask me, too.  Who's the worst one? 
[02:32:00]  Who's the worst one?  Who aged the worst?  Don't get, don't get it.  Yeah, don't get dragged into this.  I don't think, I don't think anyone's, I don't think anyone's ugly.  They're not like the fucking Partridge family.  I don't think anyone's ugly, but I'll tell you what.  It's not that she aged the worst.  I think she aged the coolest.  I like Susan.  She was such a cute little girl, and she turned out to be such a defiant badass, and I actually  like that.  Yeah.  I'm sure we get along.  Look at her.  Look at her.  Everything she says is sexy.  I'm sure we get along.  The youngest one's a defiant badass. 
[02:32:30]  It wouldn't have fit.  I like Susan.  I do.  I like Susan.  I bet Susan would smoke a bomb with me.  You've got to change the tune.  Yeah.  All right.  We should let these lovebirds go.  Hey, man.  Thanks for coming in.  What a pisser.  We've had fun.  He threw a baseball at you.  You know something?  I've had Rutger Hauer throw pencils at me, and I've had Christopher Knight throw a baseball  at me, and I enjoy the baseball more than the Rutger Hauer pencils.  Don't play baseball. 
[02:33:00]  Thank you.  As a matter of fact, if you could sign that baseball for me, I will treasure it.  I will treasure that.  Draw a picture of my vagina.  No.  Yeah, but do it like you did in school.  Look at me.  He just drew it.  No, he didn't.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, he did.  Nice.  My favorite.  That's all you get.  Wow.  Jesus.  A little sketch.  It's a coin slot.  That is not my vagina.  That doesn't look anything like this.  It's like a parking meter.  It looks like a pair of legs with, like, a leaf on top. 
[02:33:30]  I think it's a pretty good anatomical diagram.  No.  Anatomically correct?  I mean, you can't draw my vagina.  My vagina's too good.  How much hair are you putting on there?  Oh, okay.  At least he draws better than he fixes bicycles, because, as I recall, he wasn't able to hold  down that job fixing the bike.  He had the heart and everything, but he just wasn't what they call mechanically inclined.  Chris, I'm so glad you did.  That was how I just started dating me. 
[02:34:00]  He would have never done anything like this prior.  Old bastard firing you.  You're just a kid, for God's sake.  You brought the wild side out of here.  Show him how to do the work.  It's a bicycle, not a car.  She's actually sent by the devil.  The Brady Bunch is all we had left as a culture to hold on to goodness, and she's going  to make him a bad little deviant.  Who says that on an angel?  You know, look at the description of hell.  Hell is sin.  Heaven, sex, bisexuality, drugs, rock and roll.  Right.  Don't you think that's really heaven?  She's the devil.  Wow, that was very deep.  I like that.  Oh, shit. 
[02:34:30]  But I had a glove at what I would have thought that.  That is fucking funny, man.  Thank you.  Don't be yourself.  Watch out.  Yeah, really.  Throw it back at him.  Do something.  That's right.  Who carries Rick?  Throw it back at him.  That was a good time.  If he was going to catch some good times, you'd be hitting him with a club right now.  Right.  Stick up to yourself.  All right.  We've got to say goodbye to these guys.  It's My Fair Brady.  It's on VH1, of course, Sunday nights at 930.  This was great, guys.  Thank you so much.  Yeah, thank you, man.  Thank you.  What a blast.  For featuring my vagina on your show. 
[02:35:00]  And with that, we're all going to go take dumps, so we'll be back.  Okay.  Like sands through the hourglass.  So is the O&A virus.  Oh, my God.  We have to try this.  God, why didn't we think of this?  I probably did.  John in New York City.  Good morning, boys.  Hey.  How cool would it be that after those bells break, Angus Young would come in with that riff,  Hell's Bell.  Oh, nice.  We got ACDC.  Can you guys play that?  Yeah, ACDC, Hell's Bell.  Can you do two things at one time, Eric? 
[02:35:30]  Oh, look at that.  There's someone else saying, Tim from Phoenix saying,  it sounds like the audio from a bootleg Metallica concert, the beginning for Whom the Bell Tolls.  Oh, For Whom the Bell Tolls could work, too.  Yeah.  All right, are we going to try this?  Uh-oh.  All right.  We got, which one do we start with first, Anthony?  Do we do Hell's Bells or the Pope Bells ringing?  Whatever they feel comfortable with.  I want to hear both, though.  And you want to go with, oh, Nathaniel, confident.  He wants the ACDC to start first.  Yeah, ACDC. 
[02:36:00]  Look at him taking charge.  All right, hit the ACDC.  Now you hit the Pope.  Everyone is, as you can hear, cheering.  And I got to hear a piece from the United States.  You guys, are you convinced that we have a...  There it is.  Yeah.  That's so good.  Yeah, we can see the bell now, Chris.  There it goes.  We have a card.  You got us a post.  Rock and roll, baby!  Yeah, rock the post!  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[02:36:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What you just saw were the bells of St. Peter's pulling, which are looking out of the excited  faces of people in St. Peter's Square, the 115 cardinals, and the women who have a church  have chosen the 265th home in the history of the church. 
[02:37:00]  Oh, yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Rock in the Vatican!  Yeah!  Hit the post perfectly!  Holy!  Good call by Nathaniel.  Rock!  He wanted AC-DC first, which made that timeout perfectly.  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Obi and Anthony, the virus is spreading.  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah! 
[02:37:30]  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Those things we could have!  Oh yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah, like the Jets over here.  We started with David Lee Roth, we got the Sammy Hagar, and now we're down to Gary Cherone.  Oh, oh.  You call me Gary Cherone, you fucking hardy boy asshole? 
[02:38:00]  Bobby's starting to look like a Chinese movie bodyguard.  He really is looking like Tora Tanaka right now.  I'm going to take my hat off and throw it at your neck.  The toughest, invincible Chinese bodyguard.  Go through, hazuki.  You need a top hat.  Holy shit.  Patrice O'Neal in studio.  What did you think of Peter Brady?  Oh, he's finished. 
[02:38:30]  God bless him.  He's going to shoot himself at some point.  He's going to get in the middle like that tic-tac-toe box and just boom.  After that junkie gets finished with him.  That's the music that I'm going to be.  Boom.  He has absolutely no control in that relationship.  Absolutely no control.  You can see.  He's just waiting for her to shut down the pussy.  You just, it's just, I hope he's had enough, like, of that old, that 60s booty. 
[02:39:00]  When did that show come out?  70s?  Uh-uh.  Well, I just, he, I wish, he's, I wish, I think he had enough booty that you don't think  he's going to be that spellbound over her.  Oh, he probably got a lot in his day.  Yeah.  I'm not sure.  It's just bringing back.  It's like it brings back his old, you know, when it's time to change.  She's like 5'11".  She was wearing heels, so she was like 6'1", 6'2".  He's, he's, he's maybe 5'4".  Yeah.  Chris, I'd like to talk to you about something. 
[02:39:30]  Uh, yeah.  It's, it's the end.  It's over, Chris.  Uh, I'll let you glance up at me and your family for a while.  I'll, I'll stay in this square.  You can just be over there looking over at me for the last time before I tip my hat  and get the fuck out of your life.  That is the best organ ever.  Just over.  I just, I just wish I didn't see her face. 
[02:40:00]  I just, if I just saw a body, I'd be like, wow, you know, but I saw a face.  Yeah.  It's just, it's just evil.  He's pure.  He's praying that VH1 picks up his second season so he can continue the relationship.  Oh, she's built like a heroin needle.  She's just, long needle neck.  That is just some high maintenance.  That is some high maintenance on that one.  Thank you for not having me in here so I can piss off the Hollywood manager that was out there.  Oh, is that what you were doing?  Oh, yeah. 
[02:40:30]  Schmecky McGillicuddy.  And then Anthony got a baseball thrown at his head.  Yeah, I started singing.  Oh, I saw you when you were doing it.  I started singing one of the old songs and he finally had it.  I think too many Brady references in his life where he just doesn't want to hear them anymore.  It's very, you know something, there are barely any Peter-oriented episodes.  So I really had to dig deep, God damn it.  He should have appreciated that.  The one with his bad voice was like, that was one of the most famous.  Yeah.  The other one.  That one, the Marsha on my nose, huge one.  And the pork chops and applesauce.  Pork chops and applesauce is a big catchphrase. 
[02:41:00]  And Phil Packer, when he dressed like Phil Packer with the mustache and went out with  his brother as the older date.  What about the one where he changed out of the vampire back into the other costume?  That was a big one.  No, that's not the one where he's running back and forth.  The tiki.  The tiki.  The tiki is a big one.  Oh, shit.  I forgot to play that while he's here.  Damn it.  That's what a pussy sounds like when you go down there.  That would have gotten the ball thrown at me again.  Remember he's on Surreal Life?  I saw it.  The dude is built like a...  Not anymore, though.  He's getting a little doughy. 
[02:41:30]  He's losing it.  He's a little doughy.  He said he's getting a little doughy.  Yeah.  Oh.  Well, now he's got that.  So he doesn't have to work for it.  Yeah.  Well, no.  It's not even about that.  He's like...  He doesn't trust her to leave her alone for a second so he can go to the gym and do  a couple of punches.  Yeah.  He's...  You think he's just eyeballing her every second of the day?  He should learn how to shut himself down on that one now, man.  He should seriously try to learn.  That's what I do with my girl.  My girl is completely out of my league.  I treat her like shit.  What, do you wean yourself off of her so just in case she dishes you, you're fine? 
[02:42:00]  You just mentally abuse them enough where they start to believe you're sexy and they  start to believe that you'll get somebody just like them.  Yeah?  Is that how it works?  You have to, man.  By the way...  I'm a mess.  By the way, but she thinks you're the shit.  She loves me, man, because, you know, she loves me.  When did you start following the Seattle Supersonic?  Opie, stop playing.  Stop acting like you don't know who black people are.  If you see the hat matching the thing, it's just colors, man. 
[02:42:30]  It's a nice color.  It's a fucking sonic.  It has nothing to do with the team.  I wear the Iraqi soccer team colors if they came in black and orange.  Niggas do, man.  We just...  My hat's green.  Once you see my hat's green, it's like, oh, okay.  Bobby got a baseball fan's hat on.  The one that's curled and...  Yeah, yeah.  White guy fan, you know what I mean?  Well, what's up with the flat brim?  I really don't know what that's about.  It's just not that.  Like...  White guys have to do... 
[02:43:00]  Yeah, he's got to curl.  Look, you see, Anthony, it's just...  White guys curl and the black guys...  Yeah, this is...  Black guys gotta do the shit different.  Just gotta do...  They want the hat...  They want the hat...  Like it's never been touched.  They just bought it.  This hat is...  They leave the stickers on.  They leave the tag on.  No, they leave the stickers.  They actually carry the bag around with them.  The tag.  When they go inside, they put it back in the bag.  Absolutely.  See, we got pickup truck, and that's Escalade.  Ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo.  Whoa!  We're all pickup truck.  They're gonna wear a hat to the Grammys. 
[02:43:30]  That's why.  They try to make it look brand new.  Stop trying to make black people uncool.  That's the thing.  Yeah.  Black people are cool.  I mean, we'll give that to you.  Let me just say to you guys, I appreciate you still giving our little crew air time.  Because we are completely finished.  That whole Colin Quinn experiment.  Colin, I think, is still, he works hard.  Me, Keith.  Bobby, thank you very much for putting Bobby on something.  God bless you.  Who else was in our little crew? 
[02:44:00]  Norton.  Yeah, Lord Jimmy.  Norton's a psychotic.  He's not going to be able to even function in L.A.  why people think Billy Burr is betting him on the radio.  He's been going into, I don't know if you've gotten emails.  He called me.  Norton never calls me.  I was in L.A.  He's called everybody.  I guess he called everyone this week.  And he left a message like, I didn't call me, man.  We don't even talk.  I got the same one.  Here's Jimmy.  Guys, I think it's over. 
[02:44:30]  I think it's over.  They like Billy better than me.  It's like when Oliver came on the Brady Puts.  I'm feeling like when little Oliver came on.  I'm not, I'm not young and cute anymore.  I got a million dollar, I got a million dollar house.  He's losing his fucking mind.  I got a million dollar house.  I hope he dies and gets AIDS.  Oh, God.  He's losing his mind. 
[02:45:00]  Please have a contest to vote.  Get cancer in your ass.  I would like to see nothing more than Jim Norton lose his job on the radio.  Just to watch him dunk his head in the toilet.  He'll try to create a way to kill himself.  That little head in the toilet bowl.  We should really fuck up this whole HBO gig by having a poll on the website.  Wait, should we keep Jimmy?  Oh, could you?  Could you?  Oh, man.  Jimmy Norton, Bill Barr.  Who's better?  Could you?  Oh, God.  Could you please? 
[02:45:30]  So he can sit in the sun and dry up like a snail and die?  Oh, that poor little guy.  He would follow the progress of that every...  He would stop sleeping.  He would stop sleeping.  When this idiot told me everybody loves Billy on the radio, I said, Norton is really going  to kill himself.  You know something?  You can't blame him.  When you leave a position, especially temporarily, you're hoping the guy that replaces you flops.  Of course.  You know, Jimmy loves us and the show and wants it to do well, but he wanted that guy that 
[02:46:00]  came in and sat in his fucking seat to bomb every day.  Especially someone not like him.  Right, right.  Doing nothing like it.  Billy's about as corny as iced tea.  With no sugar in it.  And he comes in and they love him.  They love him.  Love his dumb red face and his giant head because they can't see it.  But we're all...  I mean, we're all the same and insecure.  There was a time...  You want him to bomb.  There was a time I had strep throat, so Anthony did the show by himself. 
[02:46:30]  You think I was at home secretly hoping that he was going to do okay?  Oh, and it was awful.  Fuck no, man.  I was praying that he was going to fall on his face.  How'd you do?  Oh, horrid.  Oh, you did?  And I heard he was a hit.  I could do alone.  You know how when he hits the Babylon without somebody to direct to steer the ship?  It's like, all right, take out this luxury liner.  I'm going to leave the rudder here on the dock.  Go.  It's our show and I was at home hoping he was going to bomb.  When he went so long.  Are you kidding me?  It hit the streets, Opie.  None of us streets like crack Billy Burr's appearance on the show. 
[02:47:00]  It hit the streets.  Because I sleep until four in the afternoon.  People just like, people love Billy Burr.  They said nothing about that garbly mouth slug.  Nothing.  It really hit the streets.  They like this at HBO.  All right, cut.  Morty.  He's like, sorry, Louie.  I just got a lot on my mind.  I got a lot on my mind, right?  Yeah, I was thinking about a lot.  They're yelling at the lighting guy.  Is there anything you can do?  Is there anything you can do?  He's thinking about buying, using his HBO money to buy a studio in L.A. to simulcast. 
[02:47:30]  He'll do it while he's filming his show.  He just bought an antenna.  And cut.  Check the gates.  I'll be right back.  Hey, fellas.  What's that?  Hey.  Hi, mates.  Every time Jimmy hits his MiFi to listen to the show, it's just Burr going,  And it was a grilled cheese sandwich.  Everyone's just laughing their balls off.  Ah, God damn it.  You're filming.  Dude, dude, dude. 
[02:48:00]  Now, you know Katrina.  Dude, dude, dude.  Comedy, people.  Ah, come on.  Oh, my God.  Poor Jimmy's just sitting there.  Oh, my God.  Just please, fellas, don't give him any.  No security, because he's...  Norton acts like a complete ass when he's comfortable.  You should see him when he's uncomfortable.  He actually gets a British accent when he's...  When he's...  Robert, would you like to go to lunch today?  It's Jimmy Norton.  Dude, you don't say that in front of people.  You don't say that. 
[02:48:30]  That's inappropriate.  Oh, that poor little fucker.  So, I'm so happy you're giving, like, you're still giving guys that I know, like...  Because, you know, Voss is completely...  You talk about stupid Peter Brady.  Rich Voss is going to shoot it.  He's going to stand out here in front of this window and go like this.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  He's going to stab him.  You know what we call him now?  Rich McFarlane.  Jesus.  That's his new name.  He's not Rich Voss anymore.  He's Rich McFarlane.  He called me and said, 
[02:49:00]  Ah, why didn't you bring me...  You know, I love you.  You know, I'm like my best friend.  He didn't bring me a...  He didn't bring me no gift for my reception.  Oh, God.  Yeah.  And I go...  I was falling for it.  He called me and Keith, right?  Because we didn't bring nothing.  And stupid brought $100.  But that's nothing either.  So...  That is pretty cheap.  Shut up, stupid.  And you know your girl told you to bring it.  Don't play me, Bobby.  She got me the card.  I told her to bring it.  No, fuck you.  She told me she got the card and I was going to give the money.  What happened?  Of course.  Do you hear that you just said what I said? 
[02:49:30]  She brought the card and you go,  Dude, should I put...  You don't give a card without money.  I know.  I said I'm going to give her money.  Bobby tries to double talk.  He tries to pimp his own friends all the time.  I'm not trying to pimp anybody.  Listen to this, though.  Go ahead.  And he calls me and he calls Keith, right?  Says, you know, I'm your friend and da-da-da-da-da.  So I'm falling for it.  Keith's falling for it, too.  And I go, wait a minute, boss.  We're supposed to be these special friends.  You didn't invite me to the wedding.  You didn't invite me to the wedding. 
[02:50:00]  Oh, I don't want to bother you.  I said, so why are you bothering me now?  Black people.  Why are you bothering me now about your dumb...  First of all, your dumb reception at Caroline's with cupcakes.  Cupcakes.  Cupcakes and salad.  The cupcakes were really good.  Bill said the red carpet was like a shower mat.  Like a real carpet.  It was like a shower mat.  It was the red rug affair.  It was his post-wedding celebration at a comedy club here in New York.  What's wrong with that? 
[02:50:30]  We're not regular squares.  We're not square people.  For you to think that I'm having something that's this thing where you are being a regular person,  I have to tell you 25 times.  Like, hey, OP, Anthony, Bobby, hey, man, this is RSVP.  RSVP?  I said I'm coming.  That's my RSVP.  All right, nigga, I'll be there.  Yeah.  You know, no one does that at RSVP.  You know what I'm saying?  So it's like, don't...  And we had to call him Rich McFarlane because we know that it's Bonnie doing that. 
[02:51:00]  Bonnie's taking over the Voss Foundation.  And Voss is going to end up having another kid.  You watch.  He's going to have a kid like 52 years old.  Because Bonnie's going to have him do it.  I'm telling you, but she...  She's probably pregnant already.  She came in pregnant.  I would make him go to Maury Povich.  Fraternity test.  I want to go on record and say that she's already pregnant.  I've got to take a fraternity test, you fucking idiot.  Hey, people, you know he's mad you didn't come, too.  He's mad everybody didn't come.  You know something? 
[02:51:30]  Dude, I called.  I wasn't going to go to Caroline's when we've got to wake up and come here in the morning.  It's an ungodly hour.  He didn't show up the next day.  That's right.  He was supposed to be on our show the next day.  The reception started at 9.30 at night.  We can't do that.  Good.  I hope you told him that.  What was I supposed to go there for 10 minutes?  I've got to be in bed by 10, 10.30 at the later.  You know what I wish you guys were saying?  Just say, we're not coming, Voss, because we don't feel like it.  I'll rest VP.  I called.  I said, I don't know.  I don't know.  Hey, we've got to move on to something else because they're reminding us to ask. 
[02:52:00]  Let me ask you about the foster thing.  Oh, shit.  Robert Kelly just kind of out of nowhere.  We've known the guy for years.  He's a foster child.  You don't know this either?  You know I was in Foster Homes.  Oh, okay.  I thought he was adopting a foster child or something.  Okay.  Yeah, I know Bob.  Oh, my God.  You thought I was adopting a kid?  Bobby's really one of the true white boys I know that has problems.  See, there's a thing about.  It's really a philosophy I have about him and certain white guys.  Yeah.  Okay.  Certain white guys, because, you know, if you're white in this world and you're not successful, 
[02:52:30]  it's really suffering.  It's a lot of suffering involved with not being a successful white guy.  Yeah, it's expected.  When you're expected.  We're still talking about me, right?  Yeah, you.  So, there's some white boys who are really David Banner trying to be the Hulk.  And there's some white boys who are the Hulk trying to be David Banner.  Right.  And Bobby is the Hulk.  He's always angry and he's always destructive and he's always evil, but he tries to walk  around with this phony, accepting smile of society. 
[02:53:00]  He doesn't realize people react to him like a nigga or a Puerto Rican.  They don't.  They don't.  He's uncomfortable.  Look at him.  Look at him fidgeting.  That background noise is him tapping the thing because Bobby tries to be this patient.  He's an evil dude.  My eyes are turning green right now.  He's just like that.  Don't make Bobby angry.  Like he's the color of the Sonic's jersey.  He can't fit it no more, but after the show, he's going to come and go, dude, what was that?  I'm not, dude.  He's going to do it. 
[02:53:30]  You said this to me a hundred times.  Until he accepts that he's not a true white guy, he's not accepted in the white community,  he needs to stop.  Look at Bobby.  He's chubby, bald.  He used to be sexy.  Like he used to be the sexy kid, but now he's Professor Turitanaka and he refuses to accept it.  So stop trying to be a white boy, King Kong Bundy.  So what's up with this Foster thing?  We were talking about extreme home makeover shows and stuff and how that's really bad 
[02:54:00]  for the family because after the crews leave, these beautiful houses are now in the middle  of the ghetto and we're thinking, you know, the neighborhood swallows up these homes from  the poor people.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  He called me a fucking nigga.  I've been telling you that for years, though, Bobby.  So we're talking about this Foster family or something, and out of nowhere he blurts out  that he was a Foster kid.  Yeah, but everybody knows that, though.  I didn't know that.  He certainly didn't want to let us know that. 
[02:54:30]  I just, after you go out of Juvie Hall, you go, they put you in Foster homes.  And, uh, and, uh, they're just, the Foster parents are awesome.  Really, they're fucking, they don't do it, most of them do it for the money.  They do it to get extra cash.  Yeah, they do.  They get something.  Literally, they'll, they, I had mac and cheese every day or peanut butter and jelly.  It wasn't like I got dinner.  That's what I had.  They did it for the extra cash because they have other kids, but they don't want to work.  What about the, uh, they have all these weird rules. 
[02:55:00]  Did you hear that institutionalized, uh, speech right there?  That poor guy.  I love Bobby, man.  That was just pain.  What about the love?  Yeah, was there any love going on?  Where was the love?  No.  No.  The guy would make, this guy would make me go out, he, I would have to wake up in the  morning, and he would, he was a security guard, just a fat, bald, redhead dude.  He'd make me go out of the house in the morning, uh, in the winter, and just walk around, because  he liked to be home, he liked to walk around in his underwear.  Well, good thing to say, yeah.  So I'd walk around Lawrence, Mass, which is a dangerous neighborhood, you know, and I'd 
[02:55:30]  have to just walk around.  No.  Lawrence is dangerous.  I didn't say it, I didn't say it, I just wanted to make Anthony know that this story  is horse shit, but.  It's not horse shit.  I didn't want to let the fans know that Lawrence is not tough.  I'm from your part of the country, Bobby.  You're from Roxbury, the worst part of Boston, but there are, there's a middle ground between,  well, you know, between Roxbury.  And Newton.  They had a riot in fucking, in, uh, Lawrence.  Yeah, it was some type of immigrant, it was, it's nothing but Guatemalans, it's a, they 
[02:56:00]  have a, they have a, they have a Guatemalan town, or whatever.  Puerto Ricans, they call them.  Puerto Ricans, it's not Guatemalans.  Puerto Ricans, you fucking know.  El Salvadorians, I think, they got up there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was.  Brazilians.  They're conquistadors.  Bobby is, Bobby is the meanest white boy ever meant, because of that foster home thing.  He's really, yeah, he had a lot of deep things going on there.  How long were you enforced to care, though?  Like, what age?  Uh, from, uh, 12, uh.  People need this info for the Photoshop they're going to do with you. 
[02:56:30]  11 to 15.  11 to 15.  And what happened before 11?  What?  What happened before you were 11?  I had a family.  I told you, do you listen?  Wait, you had a family, they gave up on you at 11?  I lived with my parents, went to jail, when you got to, you can't just go home after  juvie jail.  What do you do at 11?  You got to jail at 11.  What'd I do?  Oliver Twist.  You know what, do you know, holy...  Listen, fellas, Opie really is a white guy.  He does a lot of, uh, things that, when, when somebody, a criminal asks you what, what, 
[02:57:00]  what?  When he repeats your question, he does not want to share it.  Uh, what I, who'd I kill?  Uh, but then that's my job to keep pushing.  If he wants to come back tomorrow, he'll tell us what he wants.  What do you mean, why'd I rape her?  What, what, rape her?  No, why, why'd you rape her?  Why'd I rape her?  Uh, no, Opie did it.  No, who did you rape?  But I'll get to the boners.  You watch.  All right, all right.  What'd you do at 11?  What'd I do at 11?  What'd I do? 
[02:57:30]  What do you mean?  Wait, you went to jail at 11?  All right, Bob, what did they accuse you of doing?  Oh, that must have been wrong.  They accused me of unarmed robbery, assaulting, battering, malicious destruction, trespassing,  and breaking, but...  Wait, wait, at 11?  Yeah.  You're kidding.  Yeah, but it wasn't all that, dude.  I wasn't a, I wasn't a criminal.  I wasn't a bad kid.  Armed robbery, what was it?  Unarmed.  Oh, unarmed.  That's strong armed robbery.  That's worse than armed robbery.  Yeah.  You don't even need a weapon.  Unarmed robbery, that's called strong armed robbery without a gun.  So, Chris...  I'm just letting the pants know. 
[02:58:00]  What are you doing, dude?  Who did you...  Who did you...  Who did you...  I'm just letting people know that that's worse.  You called me a fat chink.  You called me a nigger.  And now I'm strong armed robbery.  You can't just let me have some fucking slack.  Who did you...  Who did you muscle?  Who did you muscle at 11?  It was at...  You know, what we did...  It was...  Wait, you had a little gang at 11?  Well, I hung out with kids.  You know, hang out in the park or something with a bunch of...  The same kids.  Strong arming people.  We went into a pizza store and he went in the back.  It was a kid.  One of the cooks was actually a kid he beat up a week before. 
[02:58:30]  So, we went back in the kitchen.  He says, listen...  At 11?  He said...  That's what I can't get past.  He goes, you...  You want to go out there, take the money.  You say it was three black guys who did it.  No offense.  But, uh...  Hey, I'm taking it.  Yeah, sure.  And, uh...  Whatever.  You're going to say that.  But, uh...  Mandatory.  Yeah, it's a mandatory thing.  It is a mandatory.  It just comes out.  It's in the manual.  Especially if you live in Boston.  Yeah.  Blame all kinds of black guys.  What was that?  Oh, whatever.  Charles Stewart.  Charles Stewart. 
[02:59:00]  I was there.  I was there.  They fris the entire state of Massachusetts.  Where was you yesterday, nigga?  Uh, I was on the moon.  No, you wasn't.  You killed a white woman.  I was playing for the Celtics.  No, you wasn't, motherfuckers.  No, you wasn't.  Just for the rest of the country.  The rest of the country, what's the story again?  She was pregnant.  He was a white boy pregnant.  His wife was pregnant.  He shot her in the head.  Right.  And then shot himself, like, in his lap or something.  Yeah.  And then said a nigga did it from Roxbury.  And they raped the entire community. 
[02:59:30]  They showed it on TV.  Just black dudes against a brick wall.  Oh, for Boston, that was like...  And that's when liberal white guys started, because his brother got guilty.  Yeah.  He snitched on him.  And he jumped off a bridge.  Jumped off the other.  And the same day he jumped off a bridge, my friend in high school jumped off a bridge.  But that didn't make the papers.  Oh, boy.  A white guy's always trying to cop him.  So, anyway.  He took a cab to the same bridge, and he said, right as he's pulling up to the toe, the guy  just heard, and the door didn't shut.  See what Bobby deals with? 
[03:00:00]  Bobby's a bad dude, man.  He's got rage in his eyes.  There's too much shit in your life.  I try to calm him down.  I try to keep him from dying, man.  So, he called me doll eyes.  He got doll, he does.  Like a doll's eyes.  Lifeless eyes.  Lifeless eyes.  Like a doll's eyes.  My eyelids make a click sound when they blink.  Who has black eyes?  Bobby has black eyes.  You tip him over backwards, like clothes.  With no pupils.  Bobby can see in complete darkness.  Walk us through this 11. 
[03:00:30]  Walk us through the thing.  What happened with the crime?  Keep the joint.  You're going to beat up the cook, take the money?  We're going to take the money, and what happened was, the two guys let us do it.  We were both drunk, but my friend went up to the restaurant.  Drunk at 11.  He didn't know how to do the buttons.  Yeah.  So, I went up, grabbed, pushed the button, grabbed the money.  As we were running out, I tripped on the curb, landed on my pinky finger, brought it all  the way over to my thumb.  I broke my pinky, man.  Lay in there.  You shouldn't see me, dude.  I was fucking like, eww. 
[03:01:00]  I thought my pinky was over here.  Yeah?  Okay.  And it didn't hurt.  It just looked fucked up.  You know what I mean?  It didn't hurt yet.  But the place that we actually robbed was owned by the mafia.  They have a restaurant that people don't go to downstairs.  Uh-huh.  There's a pizza place upstairs, but there's a little stairwell.  You go down, it's like maybe 10 seats, maybe 10 tables.  And, um, a week, I was actually in my friend Frankie's house, uh, watching TV, just hanging 
[03:01:30]  out, smoking dope, eating some Tyson chicken.  And the door was open.  No offense.  No offense.  No offense.  The cops just come up, just came upstairs.  The door was open.  Came up.  Grabbed you, Frankie.  Grabbed him.  It was like a Twilight Zone episode.  Grabbed him.  Just took him out.  Took him away.  And I'm sitting in his house.  His mother comes out.  Where's my son?  And I was like, the cops just came, took him.  And she was like, what the fuck?  And I was like, I don't know.  I was fucking stoned.  I'm down the park later that night. 
[03:02:00]  The guy pulls up to me, the cop.  He goes, what's your name?  I was like, uh, Robert Kelly.  He goes, there's a warrant for you.  I don't know where.  I guess the warrant got lost.  I think my mother knew one of the cops, and he kind of hid the fucking thing.  But this other dick was like, I'm going back to find it.  He goes, and if you're lucky, I'll pick you up.  Because you're an idiot.  Because the people that, the pizza store you own, they're looking for you, too.  Because they wanted to break my fucking leg.  Ah, yeah.  This is called a Lawrence tale.  Oh, is it?  Chaz Prometery came up.  A Lawrence tale. 
[03:02:30]  Would you rather be feared or loved, Patricia?  And it's absolutely true.  Bobby tells me all these goofy stories, but I can't believe you share them on the radio.  Because it makes me swear to God not to tell anybody all the time.  And I don't.  And I keep telling everybody.  Why do I have to keep my big mouth shut?  You're not just at 11.  Bobby was a strong-armed robber.  I told you I would get it out of him.  Yeah, but you make it sound a lot worse.  Unarmed robbery sounds nicer.  No, no, no, no. 
[03:03:00]  Robbery is, listen to me, tell you something.  I know.  I don't like the word strong-armed.  I've heard about different charges.  Right.  What?  Robbery is as bad as you can get.  Robbery is you taking something from a person.  Armed robbery is bad, but strong-armed robbery is almost worse.  It's worse.  Yeah.  Like, mayhem is worse than, like, third-degree, like, second-degree murder.  Mayhem.  Mayhem.  Mayhem.  The chick, actually, the chick in the pizza store.  Worse than murder.  Mayhem is when you purposely don't try to kill somebody. 
[03:03:30]  You purposely try to maim somebody.  Yeah.  So you try to remove a limb or do something bad so that they don't look the same way anymore.  That's worse than certain degrees of murder.  Of murder.  Yeah.  Wow.  So walk us through it.  So now I'm what?  You're arrested?  So I went back.  Look at all.  No, they didn't get me.  That's a good story, though.  Couldn't get me.  He says, I'm going to be, you want to not go to jail tonight, get off the streets.  I'm an idiot.  I went out.  Me and my friend got a pint of this Irish peppermint schnapps or whatever the fuck it is. 
[03:04:00]  And I went down to get some weed.  I was tanked.  All of a sudden, this cop car pulls up.  My mother's in the back seat.  It's like in slow-mo.  She's like, come here, motherfucker.  And I just, I don't know what happened.  I just walked into the car.  Because your mother calls you.  There's that little thing.  There's something in your head that just goes.  And I got in.  I went to jail that night.  And that was it.  The next day.  My mother, my bail was $10.  The judge was my first thing. 
[03:04:30]  $10.  They reduced it from $10,000 to $10.  And she wouldn't fucking pay it.  Isn't it 10% cash?  So for like a buck you get out?  She wouldn't pay $10.  She wouldn't pay nothing.  Nope.  So you sat in jail.  I went to fucking juvie jail.  It was terrifying.  $10, but they wouldn't let you out on your own reconnaissance?  Huh?  Yeah, right.  Juvenile.  Nope.  If my mother didn't want to take me.  She said to the judge.  She goes, if you give him to me, you'll be picking him up in a body bag. 
[03:05:00]  Jeez.  She was like ruthless.  And you've got to understand, Bob, his mother was still in high school at the time.  What the hell are you doing?  I'm sorry.  I'm choking, Bob.  You inadvertently called my mother a whore.  Sorry, Bob.  So how long did you have to do?  I'm choking, Bob.  That was good, though.  I liked that.  It was funny.  I know, but I've got to go against it.  I can't really laugh at my mother being a whore.  A black guy.  But your mother was young, right, Bob?  Or is that she was young when she had you?  My mother was 15 when she had my sister.  She was 18 when she had me.  She really was drunk in a bush with a schlitz. 
[03:05:30]  A goer.  Nice.  So you did juvie for how long?  I think it was like three and a half.  You go in for four months.  I think it was four or five months in juvie.  But you go from...  And why was it scary?  Like, walk us through this.  I don't know.  All right.  When you go, you go way out.  They have this place way out in the woods in Middleton.  Okay?  It's an old, abandoned, sane asylum.  Okay?  I don't know about this place, too.  Okay.  You know about it.  Yeah.  It's real.  Middle of nowhere.  You walk in.  There's a bunch of other...  And you're 11, right? 
[03:06:00]  Yeah.  That's what I can't get past, by the way.  But go ahead.  You walk in, handcuffs from the court.  You just...  And they have the real prisoners in the back.  They have a little bench in the front of the van with a screen.  And they're talking to you the whole time.  You little bitch.  I'd fuck you right in the ass.  Oh, boy.  I get you.  Look at your lips.  Mmm.  You got little sweet lips.  They're both the same size.  I like that.  You know?  They're talking to you the whole way.  Oh, boy.  So you get up there.  And then they take you out.  They put...  You're in shackles.  They take you in. 
[03:06:30]  You have to shower.  Like they clean you.  Ooh.  Which is the first time I ever...  Ooh.  I never...  I've never been naked with another dude in the room.  And I didn't even have peach fuzz.  Well, you wasn't even old enough to be a dude yet.  Yeah, but I'm next to dudes with fucking schlongs and hair.  You're like two years removed from...  Right.  Like being...  Right.  Pedophiled.  Like...  Right?  Is that...  What's that...  How old are you gay?  And what's the gay and pedophilia?  When you grow pubes.  Pubes...  Mike, is 11 pedophilia?  If you...  Oh, yeah.  I would say so. 
[03:07:00]  I think it's...  Or is he gay?  I think it's all gay.  All pedophilia.  All gay pedophilia.  Well, that...  I don't know if there's a line.  Yeah.  There's no cut-off point.  You're talking about technicalities.  Are you insane?  You know so much about the law.  I'm just saying to you.  Dirtball.  I'm saying it's like...  Really?  If something had happened to him, would that have been...  You know, is he old enough to have been a dude?  Absolutely not.  Have that happen to a dude?  No hair?  Where you tell the story, it's like, yo, they got me when I was 11.  It's like, oh, you fag. 
[03:07:30]  Or is it like, oh, jeez, man.  Yeah, poor kid.  He was pedophile.  You know what I mean?  Like...  What?  It would have been pedophile.  You're not a fag if they pin you down.  They hold you down.  All right, go ahead, Robert.  So they shower you, and people are taking a look at you.  Oh.  So, no, you shower in front of people.  Then you have to go into another room with another creepy dude, you know, who wants to  help kids.  Yeah.  But you've been single your whole life.  You live in a one-bedroom, and you're 42.  Okay. 
[03:08:00]  Yeah, you just want to help kids.  And then you have to take all your clothes off, you have to bend over, do five jumping  jacks.  You know, and it's like...  Why is that?  So, check your stuff.  Maybe stuff will fall out.  You might be smuggling, you know, like eight grams of heroin in your asshole, but I'm 11.  Check it out.  I got to know how to tie a knot that tight.  Well, a lot of people did, though.  Smuggling pop rocks up his ass.  Well, what they do is, then they put you into this big...  That's a kid thing.  Hey, guys.  Hey, check it out. 
[03:08:30]  I got pop rocks.  And then you fucking jumped on that train wreck?  Nice talking to you.  Give me one, too.  Yeah, absolutely.  So, then you go into this...  They just stick you in a room with a bunch of other kids.  And you sit there all day, and you wait till five or six o'clock at night, and then they  go, Robert Kelly, and you come over, they handcuff you, shackle you, and then tell you...  They tell you where you're going.  And then they take you in the middle of the night to some lockdown facility. 
[03:09:00]  But you slowly graduate out of shitty, shitty, a little less shitty, to, like, some place  that you can go out and, you know, have picnics in the afternoon.  And then you go from there to a foster home.  And this had to be in the mid to early 80s, so this was before rights.  So, you know, guards and stuff.  You know Bobby was abused.  Oh, yeah.  Something happened.  You know what?  Something happened.  I was in one place.  It was this place in Halifax, Mass., way out in the middle of the Cranberry Field.  No, this is Halifax now.  So, I see you went from Middleton to Halifax. 
[03:09:30]  Yeah, yeah.  And further out...  Now, Halifax, if you're not from Massachusetts, is like, never heard of it.  Right.  It's...  The further you go out in certain places, the more they do bad things.  Yeah.  This place was bad.  It was one road into the place.  I had a broken nose when I went in there.  And as soon as I got in there, you know, I got my nose broken again.  You know?  And the whole place was run by this little tiny black dude.  They called him the Godfather.  And all the other...  I don't know why. 
[03:10:00]  They all fucking...  All the other dudes.  But they went at it one day.  Every white kid was getting it.  There was one white kid.  He was bouncing the ball.  They had, like, a little tiny rim.  Only five...  Everybody could dunk it.  They used to play New York ball.  And this kid was over in the corner just bouncing a ball.  And all of a sudden, you just said,  Yo!  Homeboy!  And the kid turned around, like, happy, like they were going to ask him to play.  Oh, boy.  Five basketballs just went right into his face.  And you hear what Bobby's saying here.  People just don't get this.  This is what people...  I'm really happy he's saying this, finally. 
[03:10:30]  Yeah.  Because two things.  One, Bobby played New York basketball with a bunch of black dudes in prison.  Now, you know what New York 21 is.  It's everybody for themselves.  So it's like football, playing basketball.  So he played that with them.  Yeah, I got an elbow in the face.  Secondly, this is to these comedians out here, right,  that feel protected because we're all comedy people.  Bobby is really, like, a second from, like, killing somebody.  And I know this because I get that, too.  Like, a lot of these little skin...  Like, Greg Rogel.  You know Greg Rogel?  Yeah.  The little scrawny Jew kid.  Yeah.  He walks around, like, with this... 
[03:11:00]  Everybody's like,  You're such a fiery...  It's like, do you know how to squeeze your face off?  Do you understand?  But the fact is that we're in the same business,  so I can't...  What's protecting him from getting, you know,  is the fact that we're in this business.  So it's like, people think that,  Oh, Bob's just a lot of...  I know Bobby for years.  And we didn't like each other when we first met.  I liked you.  No, you didn't.  Jesus Christ.  We were both, like, these alpha male dudes.  And I found out that Bobby is really this dude, man. 
[03:11:30]  And he keeps from...  I mean, I have to walk him through life a lot.  Every day.  I have to walk him through, like, not killing somebody,  not doing something.  You know, dude.  And it's just like, you know how...  And I know this.  This is just...  You know, Bobby got a lot of rage.  You told him I was smoking a cigarette,  that I wasn't blowing you.  Oh, not...  Oh, sorry about that.  I'm not going to know what that sound effect was.  But you know Bobby, he's chain-smoking.  Dude, this is...  He's a real...  You know, he's a real case  that comedy is saving lives. 
[03:12:00]  For real.  You know what, dude?  I'm, uh...  I'm fucking...  I'm happy.  I know, because you know me.  So then you went into foster homes?  I'd like to be able to tell you  that Bob Kelly was able to hold off those boys.  But that's not real.  The sisters got him.  Any man would give in to a phone book  and a baseball bat to the back.  In Halifax, Bobby was here. 
[03:12:30]  Piss break, boss!  Tell us the story  of how you got your buddy's peers  for doing the roof work.  Doing the taxes.  By the way, to interrupt real fast,  Peter Brady and his lovely, lovely young girlfriend,  the pictures are now up on opandentony.com  to check out.  And you can check out what she was wearing,  which was just ridiculous.  Ridiculous.  So, uh...  So then,  your parents gave up on you?  Yeah, they...  Yeah, they were like...  After you got arrested at 11,  they just said,  that's it.  They went...  They went... 
[03:13:00]  My mother went in...  All of my friends got bailed out.  My mother went into the judge's chambers  with me.  Took all my paraphernalia,  my pot,  my bongs,  everything that I had hidden.  Put it on the desk.  She went,  what do I do?  He said,  let him go.  Just let him go through the system.  Oh.  And there you go.  And that's what she did.  She just said,  fuck it.  I hope he didn't put it like that  when you were sitting there.  What do we do?  Let him go.  Oh, I'm going?  No, no,  through the system.  And then you finally get out,  aren't you assuming you're going to go back  with your parents? 
[03:13:30]  I didn't want to go.  No, I thought...  No, at that point.  First of all,  I'll tell you why.  The first foster home I went to  was in Lynn.  It was this older couple.  They smoked weed.  Okay?  And the next door neighbor,  their friends,  the lady,  used to fucking fuck with me.  Really?  And her boyfriend used to get me high.  So he'd take me out to get high  and say,  don't tell my girl.  She'd take me over there  and fucking blow me.  And so, you know,  and then I'd hang out with my parents  and smoke butts 
[03:14:00]  and get stoned.  And they loved wrestling.  They were in the WWF back then.  So it was like,  it was unbelievable.  Are you telling me comedy  doesn't help heal lives?  Imagine if Bobby's just  a regular square walking around.  Working a nine to five.  Not being able to talk about this  and be funny about it.  Cubicle.  But most of them suck though.  Instruction.  He'd be a guy that just comes  on the job site  and kills like three people.  You can see it on the news.  So you still talk to your mom?  Oh yeah,  me and my mom are friends now.  Just friends though?  Like there's no like... 
[03:14:30]  Oh yeah,  no, no, no, no.  I'm back with my family.  I got a big Irish Catholic family.  What happened was is...  When did you finally get back?  It seems like it took many,  many years.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Probably when I was like 20.  Jesus, look how uncomfortable  you're fucking making him.  But you know what?  As you get older,  Anthony though,  you start to...  Because I thought I was abused  growing up by my mother.  I thought...  You know,  my mother was 21  when she had me,  you know?  So she's a kid.  Like when I talk to 21 year olds,  I'm like...  Young, delicious,  you know.  Imagine that trying to raise you.  I'm by herself.  So you realize, 
[03:15:00]  when you get older,  you do...  That went without saying,  by the way.  Jesus.  Thank you, Captain Obvious.  It was by herself.  Really prolific.  Oh, Jesus.  Is that in your  Dear Patrice?  There's a possibility  that my father  could have been around.  Jesus Christ.  There was a slight chance  I had a dad.  Sometimes.  Sometimes.  I'm just saying, 
[03:15:30]  once you get older...  I know we'd be calling  the Jewish Book of World Records  saying we found one.  Oh, no offense.  It's a possibility.  Sure it is.  Sure it is.  Give me a break.  I'm not trying to be  redundant here.  Let the guy some slack.  All right.  Jesus.  I'm just saying,  after you turn 30,  you realize that  you don't blame your parents  for what they did.  You realize...  You know what I mean?  So I'm sure you got...  I bet you at 25,  he loved his mom.  Yeah.  How old was your mom  when you were doing  this jail stuff?  16, 17.  She was like 29. 
[03:16:00]  She was like 11, so...  Yeah, she was young.  All right, so still  in her 20s,  maybe late 20s.  Yeah, that's no bullshit  to have to deal with.  Young and delicious.  I would go down to...  This is before I started  getting into trouble.  I'd be like,  Ma, I need help  with my homework.  She'd open the book  for two seconds  and she'd be like,  I fucking hated this shit.  Go ask your sister.  And you used to look  at it like mommy,  but they're young.  When I talk to a 25-year-old,  I'm like,  you're going to get it.  Delicious.  She was a mommy.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  30.  I'm 35.  30 years old is like, 
[03:16:30]  I got this one.  You have a banging chick  with a kid?  That's why all my girls  got kids.  I don't know a girl  without a kid.  What?  Again?  Why the fuck  are you leaving?  Because she has to go.  She has to get up  and leave.  She's going to go  wake her,  take her kid to school.  Well, just finishing up,  though,  so then it was juvie,  foster homes,  and then on your own  at 18,  I'm assuming then,  right?  And then you were free?  Actually,  I went back to my,  the last time, 
[03:17:00]  I went back to my parents' house.  I had to leave  because I couldn't deal.  Moved in with one foster father  until I was legally able  to move out,  and as soon as I was,  I moved into a house  with six retards.  And here's where I'm getting.  How did you find comedy  through all this?  Go through that.  Through that, dude.  It had to be funny  being raped.  What was the last time  you saw a happy family dude  that has money  and lives in Connecticut  that went,  I want a fucked up thing 
[03:17:30]  that happened.  Not going to comedy.  The ones that have any,  like, you know,  some power to their comedy  sort of thing to do.  It was only,  I mean, you know.  99% of comics.  I tell you what,  in juvie jail,  in juvie jail,  the thing that got me through,  honestly,  like I remember the day  all these black kids  came into my room,  and they all surrounded me,  but they ghosted me.  They were ignoring me.  Like, they sat right on my bed,  two of them up here  when I was just lying there  like this,  and they were ghosting me,  like, talking about white dudes 
[03:18:00]  and blah, blah, blah.  Oh, Jesus.  And I was just sitting there  reading my little fucking  whatever book.  Cheep, cheep, cheep, cheep.  Yeah, right?  And I go,  they go, yo,  they said something about  homeboys or white boys.  They go, you a homeboy,  you a white boy.  And I said something like,  I'm a homeboy, sir.  Some shit, just kidding.  Oh, no.  And there was silence  for like a fucking second.  Like, I fucked up.  And they went,  oh, man, you a funny motherfucker.  And I was fine.  There you go.  And that's where I learned  how to be funny, man.  But Bobby,  but see, listen,  this is the thing we talk about.  Another thing, Bob.  Oh, shit.  Secrets.  Can we have some of your secrets today? 
[03:18:30]  I got a lot of secrets  that everybody knows.  Like one.  Dude, we had a great segment with him.  Are you joking me, man?  I know, right?  You know I share  all my last dildos and everything.  We got deep with him, man.  Yeah.  You walked away going,  yeah, there is really  something wrong with me.  There's a problem.  We got into his head  one time on this show.  We want Bob to talk about this.  Thank you, Opie,  for letting him do this.  Because he wants to talk  about cheese  and Slinkies on stage.  Because he's too scared  to open up.  You don't think  it's going to be funny.  I talk about that shit now. 
[03:19:00]  I talk about fat stuff.  I thought it was really interesting.  I didn't mean to throw you on.  Genius.  Marshmallow yellow.  All right, we're going to take a break.  We've got to take a break.  It's been a while.  Let's take a break.  Anthony, we've got the Laszlo-Steve thing  they put together  for our first anniversary  on the XM7 on the radio.  You didn't congratulate us.  Oh, it has been a year.  I told you.  That's right.  God bless you.  We made a year.  No one thought  we'd make a year.  We made a year.  Yes, we did think  he was going to make a year.  Are you still mad?  Opie is up.  He really is John Wayne.  Oh, angry. 
[03:19:30]  No, no, no, no, no, no.  I'm a different person.  I'm not mad.  Are you really?  The first time I came up here,  it was just like,  you motherly old bitches.  We were very good bitches.  Patrice, we were really bitter  because we listened  to the audio recently.  Ah, whatever.  That's right, but I'm glad, man.  October, they hired.  He's got the chick.  He's got the cash.  He's got a restaurant now.  I bought a restaurant.  What?  He bought a restaurant in Boston.  He's a restaurateur.  I go out to eat a lot,  so I figure I knew  something about the restaurant business.  We don't know that.  He doesn't know.  No, my brother's figuring it all out. 
[03:20:00]  No, no, we've got a couple weeks.  Where is it?  Huntington.  In Huntington.  What do you invest in your money in,  other white guy?  The bank.  I just bank it.  That's right.  That's what I do.  Occasionally, I take a little out  and invest in Atlantic City,  Mohegan, Vegas.  You have a house, though, right?  No, we don't have houses yet.  No, I'm looking.  You didn't buy a house?  I'm looking.  I can't find one.  Mint plus, plus, plus condition.  You walk in,  and it's like, yeah,  maybe 1976.  You got a girl again?  Yeah.  She's in the office right now.  You too?  I mean, sorry about that. 
[03:20:30]  Yeah.  Wow.  And people get mad.  They call up every day,  Ope, you're not as angry anymore.  Well, you get a little...  There's nothing to be angry about right now.  Give me a break.  Yeah, I mean...  I just had to write my angry check last night, but...  What's an angry check?  That's my angry check  that I have to write to the same girl  every three months.  Are your fans growing with you, as they say?  Are your fans getting older now?  You guys, you know,  your fans are 35 now?  Yes, they're all with pipes  and reading the Wall Street Journal.  I'm saying, but how old are your fans now?  I mean, we know the psychos, but...  We got about 22,000 fans now. 
[03:21:00]  You said 22,000?  22,346 fans.  We know each one, personally.  Now, this thing is blowing...  It really is just blowing up.  It's getting pretty cool.  I thought it was like 600,000.  Probably more than that, yeah.  I saw 3.7 million outside sitting outside.  Well, no, that's up to five.  Oh, jeez.  That's an old sign.  We got to, like the McDonald's thing,  we got to change that number.  Wow, the old stripper gave me bad numbers.  No, XM is up to 5 million subscribers.  Yeah.  And then they made a huge deal with DirecTV,  so things are just flying.  Old stripper? 
[03:21:30]  What did you call it?  Oh, oh, okay.  Thanks, Ben.  Patrice, love advice.  If you leave without us getting into this column that you...  Oh, man, was that good.  Yeah, we'll do that next.  Sandy Kane is driving everyone crazy.  Do you want her in?  I don't know.  We'll figure out the Sandy Kane mess.  And we got to do the Donald Sutherland audio before we get out of here.  I can't see him crying.  This show is so stupid.  We do four hours every day, right?  Three and a half hours, we just BS our brains away.  And then the last half hour, we try to squeeze in real radio. 
[03:22:00]  We try to get the stuff we wrote down as show prep.  But Laszlo and Steve put this together for our first anniversary.  It's really, really good.  Listen to this.  Each day, millions of Americans gather around their satellite radios,  awaiting the rallying cry that unifies them all.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  But it's a show where every day may be their last.  As they celebrate one year back on the air,  let's look back on moments that could have been their final sign-off. 
[03:22:30]  This one, right?  Yes.  Oh.  You motherfucker.  Oh, Bernie, Bernie.  Stand up to your right, Bernie.  Sit down.  Oh, my God.  Dubway vigilante Bernard Getz has shot and killed radio shock jocks Opie and Anthony  during an apparent psychotic meltdown over a broken CD.  Let's go to our token Asian correspondent, Wei Xing Sal.  Another close call came with Tippi Tom, and it could have gone terribly wrong. 
[03:23:00]  Are you guys ready to wake up Tippi Tom?  Tippi Tom.  Tommy.  Uh-oh, he might be dead.  He could be.  Does he have a pulse?  Yeah, does he have a pulse?  He looks a little blue.  Oh, my God.  We could have a problem.  A homeless man died live on national radio today on the Opie and Anthony show  after passing out and swallowing his own tongue.  XM Satellite Radio fired the controversial radio team.  XM Vice President of Programming Eric Logan, who has great hair, is denying any liability. 
[03:23:30]  And while their assault on the media campaign has attracted national attention, the consequences  could have been severe.  Breaking news.  Former CBS reporter Arthur Cheyenne has reportedly gone on a rampage outside the XM studios in  New York, attacking Opie and Anthony with a samurai sword while shouting the same expletive  that got him fired.  But those things didn't happen, so it's a time of celebration for year one of the Opie and 
[03:24:00]  Anthony show.  There'll be drinks held high in the air, bear hugs, and for a few, maybe even a tranny.  Remember, every O&A show is a moment to cherish, because each show could be their last.  A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A 
[03:24:30]  I get this shirt.  Don't, don't, don't, don't make a fucking maniac.  I get this shirt.  I get this shirt. 
[03:25:00]  Don't, don't, don't, don't make a fucking maniac.  All right, lots going on today.  There's someone outside the studio that paid a lot of money to take lessons from Master Poe or something like that as part of the auction we did for the victims of Hurricane Katrina. 
[03:25:30]  Really?  Once again, I want to thank all the fans.  We raised well over $50,000 in the end.  And that's pretty damn cool.  We're going to have to get like a graphic up on opianthony.com or something.  And the Peter Brady pictures with his really hot piece of ass young girlfriend are up on the website as well.  Can I just say thank you for the liberator?  Oh, appreciate the liberator.  You got a liberator?  Thank you for the liberator.  Oh, wow.  Nice.  What's a liberator?  I have no room for it.  I'm going to put it in the kitchen. 
[03:26:00]  That's what you have sex on.  Wait, you're taking one home or you got one?  I'm taking one home, man.  One shaped like a wedge, one shaped like a pillow.  There's a liberator right there.  It's a couch made for sex possessions.  Just for sex.  Yes, yes, yes.  They started with a cute little cheese wedge, and now they're getting out of hand with these designs, actually.  Oh, we're going to have fun.  We are going to have fun.  You're really going to bring one home?  Yeah, you're a perv, though.  Do you have a swing?  I have a swing.  You did tell us you have some kind of sex swing, right?  You have a sex swing?  Yeah.  How many pounds of pressure does it hold?  I had to buy a... 
[03:26:30]  A hydraulic swing?  I don't get in it, punkin.  I don't get in it.  He called me punkin.  He's using the same shit they use on the Verrazano Bridge.  I don't get in it.  He's going to turn it on and put oil in the gas.  But it holds 300 pounds.  It holds 300 pounds.  It's great.  Sounds like the end of the Terminator.  I've got to keep my sex life going, man.  I've got to go until I can't go no more, dude.  What, do you just get bored with the same old thing and you've got to think up some new shit? 
[03:27:00]  My girl is getting to be...  The best thing is my girl's a hoe, but she was not...  I'm creative, and she's a hoe, and I've just constantly been bringing...  New shit to the table, right.  And now she's insatiable, which is why I have to swing now.  And not to swing in my house.  I have to go and get her extra.  What do you do with the swing?  I don't get it.  She sits in it.  She sits in it, and it just exposes the entire area.  Then you get under it.  You could spin her around, right?  Oh, it's delicious.  Does it have like a bungee cord, Lisa? 
[03:27:30]  They have a bungee cord one.  Yeah.  Yeah, so, you know...  Where do you put it?  Does it go hang from something?  In the vagina.  Not his penis, Opie.  I know that.  In the vagina.  It's a pretty despicable man, but, you know.  I don't like anything, like you talk about the bungee thing, or I don't like anything  but me controlling the in-out kind of motion, because I've seen too many pornos where the  chick is going wild on the guy, and the dick bends. 
[03:28:00]  Yeah.  You ever see the dick bend?  You can break it.  Looks like you're kinking a hose for a split second.  Yeah, but now it has a curve in it.  You gotta...  You gotta...  You gotta...  To the left?  You know, you gotta...  You gotta...  You gotta step up the filth, man.  You gotta be a piece of crap.  Yeah, but the bungee thing like that, taking control of the in-out, that could, I say, injure  you.  You can break...  You can break your dick.  Yeah, and...  Really?  You're clear of that.  You can actually...  Really?  ...break your dick.  Yeah.  Seriously, and it won't fill up. 
[03:28:30]  Really?  Honest to God, I've read about it.  Dude, we all know you can break your dick.  Oh.  Snap it.  I really am talking like I'm...  I'm breaking news right now.  Yeah, we own them.  You know?  Bob is reformed.  Bob is reformed.  He...  I think I'm the only one left.  The only piece of filth left.  No, Norton.  He's a piece of shit.  Hey, yeah, but speaking of filth, Patrice had a Dear Patrice column.  I love this.  What magazine is this?  The Comical, I think.  But he...  TheComical.com.  For some reason, people have been seeing it in other papers and stuff. 
[03:29:00]  So, this is a regular feature you're doing?  Yeah.  It looks like it, because you could write to Patrice.  DearPatrice at TheComical.com.  The first question, Dear Patrice, I'm a 23-year-old girl dating a 59-year-old man.  We get along really well, and the relationship is very strong.  I've dated other guys, but he's the best boyfriend I've ever had.  The best thing is that, because of his age, he doesn't play games.  If the relationship is so strong, why am I embarrassed to tell my friends and family? 
[03:29:30]  You want to read the Patrice part, Anthony?  I love this, man.  Because you're a gold-digging piece of shit.  But I love you for that.  I like how you gave her her props.  I'm a lead.  I always tell women...  I'm saying she's a gold digger.  I always tell women, while you're young and pretty, get rid of your dignity while you still have it.  Well, that makes perfect sense.  50-year-old women have to have dignity. 
[03:30:00]  It's forced upon them.  When you're 23 years old, hot, you can fuck a 59-year-old man and get some money for it.  Show something for the pussy that people want.  Now, people would read this and think, you know, oh, that's harsh.  Well, no, it's like, I don't understand why women don't make millions off their pussy and then, like, do the college and the I'm-a-better-myself thing when no one wants to fuck them.  Right.  Do it while...  But then you want to fuck, and no one wants you, and now you want to all the time. 
[03:30:30]  You, oh, give me, and you go, ah, yeah, it's been a pleasure.  Why don't you go to college?  Do what you can do.  Be a kept woman.  I think the hard one...  And tell yourself anything, but let's be honest, you're a hoe.  You can tell yourself anything.  You can be like, oh, I love him.  Like Peter Brady's girl.  It's like, he's the poopy-doo.  It's the da-da-da.  But it's like, you know what?  You're enamored with his Peter Brady-ness.  Be honest, hoe.  You are what you are.  Stop looking to be absolved.  Accept what you're doing.  You don't have anything to keep pretending you like his wrinkled balls on the top of 
[03:31:00]  your forehead.  Stop telling yourself you're doing it for all the other horse shit.  You know, meaning, you know, right.  Now you're 35 fucking a 70-year-old man, and it's like, you don't want to do that.  Just be who you are.  Be proud of it.  If I were a 23-year-old woman, I'd fuck anything that moved and get some money.  Go to school when you're 30 or 40.  Do terrible things when you're young and can do them. 
[03:31:30]  I'd love to see this girl's face as she read this advice.  Her reply.  I'm glad they have a picture of you next to it so she can just put it together.  The picture's there, so you don't mistake it.  And look at that dumb picture, too.  Like, it says it all.  Like, meh.  That's how you don't mistake it for Dear Abby.  They put the picture there.  We're going to put this fucking big fucking ass, this black ass.  Ben, what's up?  Who's basically, his advice is, you know what?  Be a prostitute.  Make some money.  And if you need a pimp, call me. 
[03:32:00]  And then fill out the college applications.  Sandy Kane, we've received complaints from other people in the offices.  She's been in our office bothering us.  Why can't she just sit the fuck down and shut up?  Poe's had it with her.  He's ready to throw her out.  Do we want her in?  I don't know.  What do you guys want to do?  All right, bring her in.  Drag her in for a couple of minutes.  As we read the next Patrice letter.  Here's the next one.  I've been going out with this girl for four years and we still haven't had sex.  I bring it up every once in a while, but she says we aren't ready yet.  I don't want to force her, but I feel four years is more than long enough. 
[03:32:30]  What should I do?  Patrice writes, that's the thing.  Women always wonder what ready is.  You know what she's really saying?  She's saying you're not really that good looking.  Because what women do is they barter their vaginas with our time.  It's a trade-off, right?  A woman looks at me and thinks, okay, he's handsome, but my pussy is worth about three months of his time, energy, and money.  If a guy's handsome enough, she'd give it up right away because his time is considered way more important than her pussy. 
[03:33:00]  So your problem is that she's not sure how long to barter her pussy with your time, especially if she's not a virgin.  If she's not a virgin, it's like, what?  But you fucked a guy under the stairwell or the bleachers, but now you're wondering if it's the right time.  For me, I hate a bitch that makes me wait if she don't make anybody else wait.  I don't want to wait any longer than any other dude.  Then they go, well, that was a mistake.  Well, you better make another mistake.  Get it right on the next motherfucker, not me. 
[03:33:30]  That's good.  You don't want to have to wait longer than any other guy she's been with.  Instead of dear Patrice, this should be dear creep.  Actually, Steve wants to rename the column.  Steve, Bayshore, go ahead.  Hey, how you guys doing this morning?  Hey, man.  Hey.  You should rename the column, Dear Apey.  Oh, Jesus.  Good one, you trying to come out the closet and edgy fag.  Hey, hey, what?  Wait, listen, he goes, Dear Apey, like it was edgy.  You're an ass.  I've been called worse by my mother, you jackass.  Go punch your clock, stupid. 
[03:34:00]  Robbie snuck outside to have a Coke and they, Apey, good one.  I'm sorry, Patrice.  I didn't know what you were going to say.  Ah, yes, you did.  It said Dear Apey on the thing.  That's what I said.  That's what the column is.  Dear Apey.  Don't give away all of us.  I looked up at the phone screen.  Hit the other one.  Phone call.  Apey.  It came in the first.  Why don't you hit Orangutan and Silverback gorilla, too?  That's why I like Bill Burry.  He doesn't give away all our secrets.  I know.  That phone call was, the subject was, wants to call him Apey. 
[03:34:30]  That's what the fuck.  Come on.  And then my job is to go, oh, wow.  And this guy's like, the guy's on the phone going, jeez, I told him what I was going to say.  Yeah, we lambast him.  Oh, man.  We do that for real sometimes.  And actually, I was joking about it.  I didn't know.  But there are times we'll have a guest and we'll be like, wow, it said he was wanting to talk about Bush.  You know. 
[03:35:00]  Oh, I didn't think it was your mother's Bush.  Oh, dear.  A listener wants to call Patrice Apey.  Patrice.  Sorry, we're protecting you.  Oh, they're awful.  Awful people.  Hey, Sandy Kane.  And I'm on the radio.  Hi, Opie.  How you doing?  Oh, Jesus.  Hey.  What's up, Sandy Kane?  Hi, Apey.  Hey, Sandy.  Jesus.  There's, um, there's...  Jesus.  I know.  I think it's a very good name for you, Patrice.  Shut up.  Shut up.  You know, you look more like an Apey than a Patrice. 
[03:35:30]  Yes, I know.  Were you Irish?  Betty Boop's grandmother.  I didn't call Betty Boop.  Oh.  All right, all right.  This bitch did silent porno.  It used to click when she was...  Same camera they shot in Nosferatu on.  That's how she came up with me.  See her shadow walking on the wall with a big long nail.  Didn't I see you at Weight Watchers?  Didn't I see you at Weight Watchers, man? 
[03:36:00]  I love you, William Dafoe.  Have another pizza.  William Dafoe with a wig.  Have another pizza.  Have another pizza, man.  Have another surprise.  You're not going to go toe-to-toe with Patrice.  No, I mean, all I know.  I'll tell you right now.  You're shot up, stupid.  I took a picture, and it took off the whole camera.  You are out of your mind.  You're going to be half off the picture.  Oh, God.  Are you out of your mind?  What's wrong with you?  Yeah, don't go toe-to-toe.  Leave it alone.  I'm not toe-to-toe. 
[03:36:30]  Bonds!  Bonds!  His toe weighs more than my whole body.  Sandy should be running for some gooks, and they should be playing a dodgy up with a string,  and the helicopter flies over there.  And she takes a wig off.  You can't see me!  I bet you have no hair under that, too.  I bet he's bald.  You can't see my wig!  I bet he's bald under that cat.  Charlie Sheen! 
[03:37:00]  You're bald.  Why don't you take your hat off?  I bet you're bald.  We've got to go back and get her.  We've got to go back and get her.  Charlie!  Charlie!  No!  Oh, my God.  Did I see a Weight Watchers?  This face is sore, lady.  I'm like, why am I doing that to this woman?  I'm sorry.  Oh, I'm just saying.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Well, if you get your own show, you'll need two televisions to watch it.  Oh, Jesus Christ. 
[03:37:30]  Wow.  That was a good one.  Religious man, you.  Oh, don't do it, Sandy.  No, I'm just saying, man.  Betty Droop.  TV's.  Oh, my God.  Oh, shit.  Shouldn't you be somewhere with your feet curled up under a house?  You are a house.  You are a house.  Maybe you thought I was a flying ape.  Am I pretty?  He's wearing yellow.  I thought he was a school bus.  What are you, a school bus or what? 
[03:38:00]  I want my slippers.  What do you eat with supper, man?  Ten pizzas?  What do you eat, baby?  What do you eat, school buses?  God bless her.  I need to be blessed.  Oh, shit.  What do you eat, school buses?  Oh, shit.  First time.  Come on.  I know.  I like that one.  Oh, God, Sandy.  What do you eat?  Oh, okay.  Oh, again.  You don't have your blonde little fucking JonBenet Ramsey wig on.  Not me. 
[03:38:30]  I just changed.  Nothing stays the same but change, Anthony.  I hear you.  All right.  That's good.  What is that, Red?  And I shaved my bush, but I'm not going to show it today.  You shaved it?  Yeah.  How did you get around plato?  I did.  I did.  Yeah, you circumnavigated against that big fucking vaginal warden.  No, I waxed it.  Did you wax it?  Bikini wax.  Have you seen it?  Have you seen it, Patrice?  No, I'm not showing it, man.  Have you seen it, Patrice?  Dude, it looks like an earlobe.  They waxed it off. 
[03:39:00]  What are you doing?  She waxed her bush, and now people could use it as a C. Everett Coupe costume.  Now I got, like, a shaved bush.  Did we get the Asian guy in and say hi real fast?  I got a new black boyfriend.  Oh, yeah?  Very small dick, too.  I mean, I'm amazed.  He's a black man of big dicks.  Do you have a big one, then?  Not really.  Okay, all right.  Oh, shit.  It's probably as big as that ward.  Oh, shit.  Oh, Jesus.  Hey, what do we got in the studio?  Another guy? 
[03:39:30]  What's your name, sir?  Uh, Will.  Will.  Yes.  And you are here for what?  Uh, I bid on the auction.  This fucking guy's eyes, he has the biggest eyes I've ever seen for an Asian guy.  They opened it up pretty wide.  Patrice, throw all those pens on the ground and see if you can count them real quick.  And you won the auction for what?  Uh, I bid on the Matt Hardy action figure.  Matt Hardy action figure?  I'm not Bob Kelly.  Don't hold my hand.  Was he gay or something? 
[03:40:00]  Were you gay, Patrice?  I'm just trying to help him out.  Just like Asian man, I knew.  I used to be on the Master Poe lessons.  Master Poe lessons.  Now, then he's going to teach you some, uh, Kirate.  Something like that.  If I may say it like that.  Some Taekwondo.  Yeah.  Yeah?  And, uh, do you know any?  Or is this like you're just going to be a beginner?  Pretty much a beginner.  You get your ass kicked a lot is why you want to learn a little self-defense?  Well, they try to, but...  They try to, but what stops them?  Well, I, I hurt them without...  You do?  You fight back? 
[03:40:30]  Yeah.  I have no real skill in it, but I do.  Do you just got to see...  Oh, wow.  Damn it.  Sometimes Asian guys just got to take that stance, and they scare the shit out of you.  Well, thanks for spending all the money.  Yeah.  Very good.  Thank you very much.  Thank you so much.  Sandy, I heard you were driving everybody fucking crazy out there because you wouldn't sit  out.  I blew him in the bathroom.  I blew him in the bathroom, that ancient guy.  No, you didn't.  And he had a very small dick.  Jesus.  You have nothing. 
[03:41:00]  Betty Droop.  Let's say hi to Will.  Betty Droop.  Betty Droop is what's the most famous name.  Betty Droop.  She was annoying everybody out there.  I have a friend here.  I wanted to bring him on the show.  His name is Scotty the Blue Bunny.  All right, we can...  I'll book him.  Jesus Christ.  That guy looks like a psychopathic faggot.  This is my second foster dad.  Why does he look like Fezzy?  Does he look like Fezzy?  Yeah, he's got a little Fez to him.  Can I bring him on?  Yeah, bring him on when?  Tomorrow?  Yeah.  Yeah, come on back tomorrow with...  What is his name?

I know that walk is supposed to be on my nose.  Inka-Dink-A-Doo.  He's really, really...  He works burlesque rooms all over the next city.  Oh, we-oh.  All right, let's love him.  Weal in New Jersey.  What did you learn on the show today?  I learned that you're not a fag if they pin you down.  Not a fag if they pin you down.  Very good.  Let's say hi to Prozac.  Prozac, what do you got?  I learned Peter Brady's chick is built like a heroin needle with her coin-slop pussy.
