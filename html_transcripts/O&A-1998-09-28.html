<pre> How great I am!  Hey Mark, don't kid yourself, you got a tiny penis.  He's got those raisins down there because of that, whatever he's taking.  Yeah.  Those roid things.  It's technically a steroid.  Technically. But congratulations on Mark McGuire.  Man, four homers in two days.  It was a very exciting day for baseball yesterday.  Hey, how about those Amazons?  I think, quite frankly, it's amazing that they only needed one game out of five to stay in it. 
[00:30]
 And they blew it. Amazing.  You had to bring it up.  Who wasn't going to? Oh, I was pretty depressed actually yesterday.  What a choke team. I mean, I'm sorry, Metfans, but the big choke.  Come on, one game out of five.  We just had to win one.  One game.  That's what it came down to. And then we couldn't do that.  And Mike Piazza.  Yeah, you're worth the 80 million, really.  You really look like you deserve that money.  He did get a bum call on one of those pitches.  One pitch does not make a game. 
[01:00]
 No, I think that was a strike.  No, outside.  And who is he going to cry to at this point? I know, it's over.  He had a horrible series. And right after the game, he chopped off those ridiculous sideburns.  Supposedly those sideburns were his good luck charm.  He got rid of those real fast.  He should have done it before he got up to back.  Yeah.  I don't think it helped him out.  No, but it was fun yesterday to flip around the TV.  A lot of things going on here.  He had like four games on in one time. He didn't know where to go.  But congratulations to the Yankees. 
[01:30]
 Who got the ball? Big Mac 70th.  Who got it, old play?  There's a picture of the guy and he has a black eye in the paper today.  Did anyone else notice the guy that caught number 70 has a black eye?  I wonder why.  And the reporters didn't ask him how he got the black eye.  I wonder if you got the black eye going for the ball.  I wouldn't doubt it. They were animals.  Yeah.  Clawing and punching.  I had a huge argument with my brothers yesterday.  I had all my brothers over yesterday.  About Mark McGuire and giving the ball back. 
[02:00]
 Yeah.  I think the people should try to make a profit off these balls.  Absolutely, we've been saying that.  It's all cute.  Mr. McGuire, I think I got something that belongs to you.  As you hand over the ball and you go back to your $7 an hour job  while Mark McGuire takes the ball and goes to his multi-million dollar mansion.  And a couple of my brothers didn't agree with me, which is fine.  But then the thought I wanted to make was, you know,  Mark McGuire himself cheapened the record.  Don't kid yourself. 
[02:30]
 When he hit number 62 and you saw all that celebration going on in the field,  it looked all natural and real.  At one point he had to try to find the camera so he could look in it and go,  I'm going to Disney World.  You know what I mean?  And he got a million dollars for doing that.  So he made money off the home run.  So why can't the fan?  He could have though. That's just it.  The fan could have. He was stupid.  It's all the pressure, the pressure of the media.  You know, you got to do the good thing and give the ball back.  That's stupid.  You know something no one to blame. 
[03:00]
 McGuire's not to blame. Why is he to blame?  You know, who's to blame is the dopey kid that gave it back to him.  Yeah, it was his choice. Keep the ball.  Right.  Now screw it.  So I hope the guy who caught number 70, you know, keeps it, sells it, makes it milk.  Cash in. Well, you know, that might not be the record, Opie.  Shut up.  Sammy Sosa.  He's got to hit five tonight.  I can hit five home runs.  Yeah, that'll happen.  Do you know what Regis called him this morning?  What?  Manny Sosa.  He did?  He did.  These guys can't figure out.  You want to jump on the bandwagon and act like they know what's going on in baseball, 
[03:30]
 like Ted Kennedy the other day calling it Mike McGuire and Sammy Sosa?  Sammy Sasa.  Sasa.  What a dopey name.  And now Regis screwed up the name?  Yeah.  And Manny Sosa's up later.  Manny Sosa.  Even Cathy Lee looked at him like he had three heads.  All right. Well, we're ready to rock.  Yeah.  Got a little off our chest.  For a Monday.  So I'm in awe of myself and Anthony's in awe of himself.  Yeah, we're all in awe of ourselves.  And if you're listening to this program, you too should be in awe of yourself. 
[04:00]
 We should all be in awe today on this lovely Monday.  All right.  Factsline 212-957-WNEW.  Phone line, no one's calling you, huh?  Wow, thanks.  Thanks for the support and help as we put the effort out here every day.  No, that's okay.  Don't call us.  That's great.  We feel real special when the phones don't ring.  212-757-1027.  1027-WNEW, the Rock of New York Green Day from Dookie, Van Halen, and Kenny Wayne Shepard.  To, NEW has your tickets to see a taping of VH1's Hard Rock Live featuring Kenny Wayne Shepard 
[04:30]
 beginning tomorrow during the Dave Herman Rock and Roll morning show.  And of course, NEW is the Rock of New York.  What the hell are you doing with that whip?  I feel like Indiana Jones.  Wow.  Where'd you get that whip from?  I don't know.  Carol Miller just brought it in.  Yeah?  Wait, you got handcuffs and a whip?  Yeah, I don't know what she means.  Someone brought them in.  Yeah?  Gave them to her to give to us, but...  All right. 
[05:00]
 I don't know.  Okay.  Man, that's going to add a wake.  I can't imagine that would ever be fun to get hit with that.  I'm not into that.  It's not my fetish.  Not your style, right?  No, I'm into pleasure, not pain.  All right, 212-757-1027 if you got something for the show.  Hey, what's up?  Anthony.  Yeah, how you doing?  What's up?  Listen, I took one of your little bits that I used.  I hope you don't mind.  What did you do?  Well, I was driving with my girlfriend back in Brooklyn, like on Avenue L, and I saw one  of these guys delivering Chinese food.  I was sitting there screaming, I want to deliver pork, pork, I want to deliver pork. 
[05:30]
 The guy took a hit and spilled all the food on the road.  Then he started screaming like Ricky Ricciardo.  I'm like, get out of here before he starts throwing dead pigeons and squirrels at us.  Out of the way, why you...  Just move out of the way, I have to deliver white jang pork.  It was so funny.  And she was going, oh that pork, I'm going to get out of here before he kills us.  You made me drop all of my pork.  I dropped jang fang pork, one jang pork, king fang pork, and sweet sour tang fang pork. 
[06:00]
 It was hilarious.  I thought he said he gets something, but he goes, oh no, no, no, no.  That's why he's got the helmet on.  You guys rule, man.  Take care.  The Rock of New York, 1027, WNEW.  Title track from Dirty Boogie, the Brian Setzer Orchestra, Sophie and Anthony.  Hey, on your Monday afternoon...  Monday's a little rough.  I love when DJs say that, on your Monday afternoon, everyone. 
[06:30]
 It's yours.  It's yours, take it, use it, have fun with it.  It's yours.  People getting in touch with us through the phones, faxes, and instant feedback, Opie.  We've got to explain the instant feedback because I don't think people are getting it.  We really love to know that we suck and that we rock and that we rule and you guys are horrible.  But also use the instant feedback to get in on the show.  It's your chance to get in on the show and be like the third member of the Opie and Anthony program. 
[07:00]
 Sitting by your computer at work, can't get in touch with us through the phones or something,  or don't want to go to the fax machine, right there, www.com.  We get our best stuff from the listeners.  Flat out, we get our best stuff.  If you want to comment on anything we've talked about in the last month,  just because we're not talking about it today, if something sparked a thought in your head on the way home two weeks ago  and you're like, oh, but they're not talking about that anymore, just write an instant feedback and send it over there.  Anthony goes through all of them and tries to put as many on the air as possible every day.  Like Anthony from New Jersey, who has a great name. 
[07:30]
 I've been listening for two weeks and like the change with the station.  Thank you.  Just thought I'd chime in and let you guys know that I thought it was weird that my name is Anthony.  And my wife's name is Jen.  Oh, really? That's your wife's name?  Oh, okay.  And I used to get Woody's on the school bus too.  Just like Anthony.  Just like I used to.  Not only that, I had to bury a cat two days ago.  How weird is this?  Wow.  That is a little bizarre.  How about that?  Cool.  Because I had to bury a cat. 
[08:00]
 I know.  Now your house isn't smelling anymore, right?  No, because I didn't bury the cat.  I threw it behind the house and it started rotting.  Yeah.  And I just poured bleach on it.  And that did the trick.  Smell it and it went away.  You got a dead animal rotting in your yard and it stinks?  Uh-huh.  Throw a whole bottle of Clorox on it.  I think you should send a letter to Martha Stewart.  She could maybe do a segment on this.  If there's rotting carcass in your yard, I suggest Clorox bleach.  Don't go with one of those color bleaches.  Why not, huh?  Yeah. 
[08:30]
 Factors coming in like crazy.  You got to say hi to crazy Dave and Queens and Mel and Stephanie and also Queens Astoria.  My birth town.  Astoria.  Astoria Queens.  Were you born there and then taken out when you were a month old?  Pretty much.  Everyone makes fun of what I look like, but I guess because I got the blonde hair and blue  eyes, I just don't belong in Astoria Queens anymore.  Get out.  Well, back then there were a lot of us in that lovely community, Anthony.  When we were born, around that time, the goal of our parents was that we would be born and 
[09:00]
 they would move us out to the island as quickly as possible because I was born in Flushing  and then whisked away to East Northport when I was a kid.  That's just what they did.  Then we used to visit Astoria.  We got out of there when I was five or six.  We go back now.  Oh my God.  Dad, you sure we didn't cross the border?  Oh my God. 
[09:30]
 Well, what about Flushing?  My God, I used to go there and see my little playmates and friends that I had to leave  when I moved out to the island.  My parents would drive me in.  It was like a whole big weekend.  Oh, I'm going to see my best friend, Roy DeLuca.  This is great.  Roy DeLuca.  Yeah, he was my pal back in Flushing.  Now I drive through Flushing.  It's like, hey, pork, you are the mountain pork or Wengang Wengang Park.  You're the Tungkuang Park. 
[10:00]
 I was born here.  Yeah.  My name is a little strange.  My name is Anthony Chang.  Hi, what's up?  I just wanted to tell you guys that I'm a new listener.  I've been a couple of weeks.  What did you used to listen to?  Am I allowed to say it?  Yeah.  I used to listen to KTU.  KTU.  What happened?  I don't know.  I started out.  I was off work for the summer.  I went back to work and I started listening to you guys on the way home.  Thank you.  I like your honesty.  I appreciate that.  You make me laugh after a hard day of work. 
[10:30]
 It's nice to laugh.  Plus, we can bust out a mean rhyme here, me and Anne.  Oh, yeah.  I love you.  Just like KTU.  I already put your number three on my preset.  All right.  Thank you.  Have a great afternoon.  Thank you.  Take it easy.  Bye.  Isn't KTU one of those radio stations they play the same song for 20 straight hours?  I don't know.  It's all just boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.  It sounds the same to me. 
[11:00]
 And you dance.  Yeah.  Ben Lizzie on the Rock of New York, 1027 WNEW.  You're hanging with Opie and Anthony.  Phones are a little late right now, so if you're trying to get through, you've got a good shot at that.  212-757-1027.  If you're working, you can fax us, 212-957-WNEW.  I got a thought.  I was watching The Price is Right this morning before we came in, OK?  Hard day.  Pretty much.  Yeah, pretty much.  Rough morning for the Obsterhands. 
[11:30]
 Yeah, a little rough morning.  I kind of got my Hurricane George update, and then I went to The Price is Right.  But it's just a stupid thought.  Why haven't you ever seen a handicapped person on The Price is Right?  Because they can't come on down, right?  Well, I'm serious, though.  I mean, don't they randomly pick the contestants from the audience, supposedly?  Jane Smith!  You're the next contestant on The Price is Right!  You're trying to tell me in the last 30 or 40 years there hasn't been handicapped people 
[12:00]
 or retarded people in the audience that they purposely avoided?  You don't think that's all set who they're going to call down?  Of course it is.  Of course it is.  But yeah, you'd think they'd have somebody that maybe has crutches or something.  Oh, I've got to tell you something.  I put my foot in my mouth.  Dad!  I went out east this weekend to...  I don't even want to admit it on our show, but... 
[12:30]
 Oh, I know what you did.  Yeah, you were trying to drag me to go.  I went out east to do some pumpkin...  What?  Go ahead, tell everybody.  What?  I went out east, Long Island.  Uh-huh, out east, right, right.  To do some pumpkin...  Some what?  What?  Pumpkin...  Say it louder.  Pumpkin...  Pumpkin...  What?  I had to go pumpkin picking.  Pumpkin picking!  Yeah.  I get a call Saturday morning. 
[13:00]
 Uh, and?  Yeah, oh?  Um, why don't you guys come out east with me and Sandy?  We're going pumpkin picking.  Oh, pumpkin picking, Opie!  Yeah, wow!  Okay, don't leave!  Please don't leave!  I just have to hop in the shower and I'll be right over to pumpkin picking.  I want you to be there in my time of misery.  I knew why you were calling me.  They have some wineries out there.  I figured we could get all sauced up.  I...  And that's another thing.  Opie has this way of trying to get me to do something that he knows I'm not going to want to do 
[13:30]
 and that really sucks by trying to say there'll be alcohol there.  Well, when I first met you, that was a big influence in your life.  What can I say?  So you've changed a little bit.  You don't drink as much now.  It's amazing.  I think it's like, Anne, we're going pumpkin picking.  Yeah.  Why would I possibly want to go pumpkin picking with you?  Well, there's some wineries out there and maybe you could get a boost at one of the wineries. 
[14:00]
 When we first met, you were very easily influenced over beer.  Hey, Anne, I'm going to spend the weekend hanging out in the glory holes.  No, there's going to be a keg in there.  You want to join me?  Oh, yeah!  There's going to be beer on there!  You would do almost anything for beer when I first met you.  Oh, come on!  I was destitute.  Well, how do you think you got involved with my radio show way back then?  Obviously, it was through beer.  Because there was beer there?  Yes.  Come on, Anne, hang out with me.  There's going to be beer there!  There's going to be beer?  Beer?  Yeah?  Okay. 
[14:30]
 It ain't working, especially with pumpkin picking.  And then we did the heroin coffee back then, too.  We got some stories.  We got to tell those stories someday.  But anyway, this weekend I was pumpkin picking.  Alone.  No, with Sandy.  I had to blow off the call, though, from, you know...  What?  I just have a tough life.  Oh, yeah!  There's always the girls calling.  They call me up, you know?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, these girls.  You be the girl and I'll be me.  I'll be this weekend. 
[15:00]
 This is my life.  This is why it's so much fun to go out with somebody.  Hello?  Hi, Opi?  Yeah?  Hi, it's Candy.  Oh, hi, Candy.  What's going on?  Well, Crystal's over my house.  Yeah?  And we're going to have a who gives the best Lewinsky contest.  Oh, yeah?  And we'd love for you to be a judge.  Oh, you...  You come over?  Oh, you wacky kids.  You know this is the weekend I'm going out east to do some pumpkin picking.  Come on!  Oh, that's a shame.  Okay, do you have Anthony's number?  Anthony's coming with me.  Trust me.  That's my hell, though.  Hi, Opi?  Yeah?  Yeah, it's Andy. 
[15:30]
 Andy?  Andy?  Andy?  Andy?  Andy?  Andy?  Andy?  Andy?  Yeah?  Yeah, it's Candy and Crystal again.  Yeah, hi, guys.  Yeah, we're having an argument over here.  Who has the firmest boobs?  Yeah?  And we know you have, like, really sensitive hands.  Could you just come over and feel our boobs?  Oh, you wacky kids.  You know after pumpkin picking we're going to go get some fresh warm apple cider?  Isn't it fun to be married or go out with someone for a long time? 
[16:00]
 Oh, man.  Hell.  It's good.  So anyways, I went out to eat pumpkin picking and we got our little cart and kind of...  Oh, jeez.  How was it?  Fun?  Did you have a great time?  It depends who's listening right now.  No, it was a great time.  I had a lot of fun, Anthony.  I kept my manhood.  I saw Ronan.  I went to the movies.  So anyways, we're picking our pumpkins and putting it in our cute little red cart that 
[16:30]
 you've got to drag behind you.  And then all of a sudden...  Hey!  Hey!  I can't even defend myself today so you can call me whatever you want.  All right.  So then all of a sudden Sandy picks up this really distorted looking pumpkin and says,  hey man, this thing's pretty cool.  I go, Sam, put that one back.  It's retarded looking.  And I swear to you, I turned around and there was a family of Down Syndrome kids.  No way. 
[17:00]
 Pumpkin picking less than 10 feet away from me and I put my foot in my mouth so bad.  Oh, no.  I said, it is the pumpkins.  I was like, oh my God, I can't believe I just saw it.  Oh, that's embarrassing.  Oh my God.  Oh, they're looking at me.  Oh, great.  Oh, this is good.  Okay.  I hate when that happens.  I felt this big this weekend.  Embarrass yourself with your foot in your mouth.  I did that once really bad.  I was driving to the bank during lunch hour.  This guy and I go to buckle my seatbelt and it's huge.  And I pull the strap like two feet so it cinches up. 
[17:30]
 It's like, gee, who the hell is sitting here?  Who's a fat load of crap sitting in this seat?  Oh, my mom.  Sorry, man.  Maybe I'm just skinny.  I'm sorry.  Don't you feel like the biggest idiot when that happens?  Insert foot in mouth.  Yeah, exactly.  I mean, we've all done the, when does the baby do?  Oh, that's a bad one.  And right when do comes out, you realize, oh, maybe I shouldn't have said that.  And you want to take the word back, but it's too late? 
[18:00]
 When does the baby, oh, no, here it comes.  Hey, how's Bobby been?  Ain't seen him in a while.  He's dead.  Oh, man, phones are going crazy.  Um, Albie?  Yeah, who's this?  It's Candy and Crystal again.  Oh, hi, guys.  What's going on?  What are you doing this weekend?  We're having a contest.  It's kind of silly, but we want to see who can have sex for the longest time, me or Crystal.  And you want me to be the?  Yeah, well, we need somebody to have sex with for hours and hours on end. 
[18:30]
 So could you come over?  Oh, I would love to, guys, but you know I'm going out east with my girlfriend.  There's a hot air balloon festival this weekend.  Oh, okay, well maybe next time.  We'll find somebody.  And then I'm going to have a barbecue.  Hi, Andy W.  Yeah, you know, I want to know about Aris Smith, when he's coming to Jones Beach.  Aris Smith.  Aris Smith at Jones Beach?  Yeah.  Aris Smith, Jones Beach, October 13th and 15th.  Where do I have to find the ticket? 
[19:00]
 You can buy them through Ticketmaster.  Ticketmaster?  I can buy in the theater?  What?  In the Jones Beach?  In the Jones Beach box office.  Jones Beach box office, yes.  Oh, in the office.  You know what is the number there?  Not offhand.  Oh, what number do you have for call for them?  Phone book.  Call 4-1-1-1 and they'll tell you.  4-1-1-1?  Yeah.  Oh, right, you speak Spanish.  And ask for Jones Beach ticket office.  Okay.  4-1-1-1.  Yeah. 
[19:30]
 Jones Beach office.  You're doing a good job.  Thank you.  Mis co-gratulatio.  And now that the home run race is over, could you put Opie and Anthony on the back of your  window instead of that stupid Sosa 66 thing?  Yeah, how about that?  Oh.  That's a good idea.  I think it's a good idea.  I love it.  All right, come on you guys in Washington Heights.  The home run race is over.  Erase your windows and put Opie and Anthony on any W.  Yeah, the best.  All right.  All right.  All right, my friend.  Good luck.  There you go.  I like that idea, actually. 
[20:00]
 That is.  It doesn't matter anymore, really.  No, not at all.  Now, McGuire's got 70.  Sosa needs five to get the record, so obviously it doesn't matter.  It's all over, yes it is.  This is for Opie and Anthony.  So, okay.  1027 WNEW, the Rock of New York with the wall flowers.  Opie and Anthony, for your ride home.  Whoa, whoa.  I got to tease something.  This is called a little radio tease show.  I'm going to tease something.  I'm going to tease something.  I'm going to tease something.  I'm going to tease something.  I'm going to tease something.  I'm going to tease something.  I'm going to tease something.  I got to tease something.  This is called a little radio tease in the business to make you listen a little longer.  Oh, was that at Opie? 
[20:30]
 I was reading email before we got in today.  People love our game, Dead or Alive, where we call these celebrities.  We're not sure if they're alive or dead.  Then you and I, we bet a beer on whether the guy's alive or dead.  We've done it with Buddy Epson, Tiny Tim before he died.  Before he died.  And a young man before he died.  Sam Drucker.  Sam Drucker.  From Green Acres.  It's a fun game.  It's a fun game, especially when the loser has to explain why we're calling and why we're 
[21:00]
 betting a beer on his life.  When the person answers the phone, if they're alive, the loser who said that he would be  dead has to now tell the guy why you're calling.  You can't lie and say, because I was a big fan, you've got to tell him the reason why  you called.  The email has been going absolutely nuts.  They really like that concept.  I found a piece of tape from the time we did this with Mr. Scooby Doo. 
[21:30]
 Oh, Scooby's voice.  Scooby's voice.  Don Mesner, if I'm not mistaken.  He also did a bunch of other voices, too.  He was the king of cartoon voices, actually.  Every cartoon back in the 60s and early 70s, that was his voice.  He did Ranger Smith and Boo Boo Bear.  Boo Boo and Yogi and everybody.  He did just about everyone.  Me and Anthony called him one day to play Alive or Dead.  Stick around.  The tape is tragic.  To say the least, it's tragic. 
[22:00]
 I'm sure he was sharp at one time.  The only way we could explain it when he's doing his cartoon voices, he's as lucid as  they come.  Then me and Anthony are trying to have a little interview with the guy.  We found out quickly that the guy is not there whatsoever.  He is a cartoon.  But you just tell him to do a cartoon voice and he's fine.  So please stick around for that.  I think you'll enjoy it.  I mean, it's a tragic piece of tape.  Cringe along with us.  Yeah, it's cringe radio at its best.  Little instant feedback there, Ralph.  Bruce from Parts Unknown. 
[22:30]
 Because of you two, I can no longer watch any hurricane-related news.  You're right.  Just show stock footage of downed trees and sheared tin roofs.  How come every guy who reports on the hurricane looks like the guy from the Islanders logo?  The old Islanders logo, yeah.  The one they tried to change.  The Gortons of Gloucester Fishermen.  These weather geeks are getting pathetic.  There was one guy practically in the surf just trying to look as dangerous as possible.  I'm here.  Here it is.  Let's go now to Storm Van Normansen in Biloxi. 
[23:00]
 As you see, the surf really kicking up now as these winds blowing in from the southeast  have really picked up in the last blah, blah, blah.  We've heard it how many times?  How many times do we have to watch people putting plywood over their windows?  And they're squinting because the rain is hitting them at 100 miles an hour.  They look like complete dopes.  The palm tree is blowing again.  Look at that sign.  It's shaking. 
[23:30]
 It's going to fly off.  There it goes.  It's blowing down the street.  Look at this lovely couple.  They're hanging plywood around their windows so they don't lose their house.  Look at the hardware store.  It's all out of batteries and flashlights.  Totally out now.  Look at the shot from the shelter with all the people sleeping together.  Look out for that downed wire.  Look at it sparking.  The car is driving through the big puddle right now.  Look at this shot, Anthony, of the lawn furniture in the pool.  Look at that wind blowing that awning. 
[24:00]
 There it goes.  It just blew off.  I've never seen that before.  In past hurricane footage.  Here's one for you, Anthony.  The line of cars going over the only bridge out of town.  Oh, yeah.  The evacuation.  Boy, I've never seen this before.  Oh, and here's the interview with the local mayor.  Come on.  It was a break.  The guy in the wind and rain.  We've seen it already.  I've got a fax here.  I love Skid Marks.  That kid has balls of steel. 
[24:30]
 Oh, God.  I got an instant feedback from somebody who said that thanks to us, he couldn't get that  song out of his head.  Yeah.  All weekend.  Well, we've got to replay it here.  If Skid Mark is listening today, could you please call us?  Because we want you to come down to the studio and perform your little song for everyone.  Because over the phone, it just doesn't do it justice.  You don't have to do it live.  Yeah.  On Friday, this kid Skid Mark, he's 12 years old, decided to sing his own wacky song parody  about Bill and Monica.  And honestly, a ton of people called today saying they were humming this song in their 
[25:00]
 sleep all weekend long.  So, it's more talented than Alfalfa from The Little Rascal.  There you go.  So, without further ado, here's Skid Mark from Friday.  Check it out.  OK, here it is.  Mama keeps on crying all about my daddy's lying and the way he cheated on her with Monica.  Mama reads the papers all about my daddy's papers and she calls him a hushy lorry man.  And she'd like to have a little explanation about what I heard during the latest conversation. 
[25:30]
 I will say without the most of hesitation, Mama didn't like to shout, Bill, get out,  get out.  Mama keeps on crying all about my daddy's lying and the way he cheated on her with Monica.  His question valuations have gone to hell these days.  Now he's a god-fearing hushy lorry man.  If he'd like to have a little explanation about what I heard during the latest conversation, 
[26:00]
 I will say without the most of hesitation, Mama didn't like to shout, Bill, get out,  get out.  Mama keeps on crying all about my daddy's lying and the way he cheated on her with Monica.  Mama reads the papers all about my daddy's papers and she calls him a hushy lorry man. 
[26:30]
 And there he goes, skidmarked for Friday.  I guarantee you'll be humming that song later tonight.  It'll hit you.  You'll be going to that fridge for a midnight snack and also, it'll hit you.  You want to hit yourself in the head with a lump hammer.  1027, WNAW, The Rock of New York, Sean Mullins, Lullaby from the Souls Core CD.  It's Opie and Anthony.  We just got an email from my brother and he's telling me that Don Mezik, who was the voice  of Scooby-Doo, is dead. 
[27:00]
 He's dead, Opie.  I've got to call my brother and make sure this is definite.  Hello?  Elms?  Hey.  Don Mezik?  Hey.  Don Mezik is dead?  Yeah.  Oh, man.  You didn't realize it?  No, I did not.  Yeah, I heard you talk and I was like, I don't think they know that he actually did die.  It must have been like the day after we talked to him.  Yeah, it wasn't that.  I remember around Christmas time or something and I was in Warner Brothers and they had 
[27:30]
 like a tribute thing with Scooby looking down and said Don Mezik or whatever his name is,  blah, blah, blah.  It's 1997.  Oh, no.  Or 98.  It might have been earlier this year.  Oh, great.  OK.  That's why I heard him.  Man, they talked and I said, I don't know he died.  Oops.  Well, now we know.  Yeah.  Well, we still got to play this tape, so.  Yeah, but I would just say, you know, it's a shame he died or something.  Yeah, without a doubt.  You're ruining all our childhoods.  Everyone grew up with Scooby-Doo.  Yeah. 
[28:00]
 Scooby-Scooby-Doo.  All right, bro.  Talk to you soon.  Bye.  Bye.  Well, great.  That puts a whole new spin on our little bit that we had planned for here, Anthony.  I got my Dead or Alive celebrity web page up and Don Mezek is absolutely dead of a stroke  to October 24th, 1997.  Born in 1927.  Well, there's no turning back.  We got to play this tape.  Oh, my.  I mean, we got it at this point. 
[28:30]
 I didn't know he actually died.  No wonder he couldn't talk right.  You know, this is now the third celebrity that we played Dead or Alive with that is  now dead.  That's right.  We played it with Henny Youngman before he died.  We played it with the band.  We played it with the band.  We played it with the band.  We played it with the band.  We played it with the band.  We played it with the band.  We played it with the band.  We played it with Tiny Tim before he died.  And now we got a tape of Don Mezek where we played Dead or Alive and now officially he's  dead.  Which makes this tape even more tragic.  And honestly, if I had any feelings in my bones, I wouldn't play this right now. 
[29:00]
 Who cares?  Play it.  Okay.  Well, it's our little game we like to play from time to time.  It's called Dead or Alive.  We call these celebrities that are barely alive and then we bet a beer on whether they're  alive or dead.  And when we called Don Mezek, he was alive a couple years back.  He was alive.  Yes.  And now I can understand why he sounded like he did in this phone call.  All right.  Because he didn't have many days left.  So, well, let's just play the tape.  Hey, Mr. Do.  Me and my partner Obea, we have this stupid little contest. 
[29:30]
 Yes.  Where we bet a beer.  Yes.  Oh no, here it comes.  Then we call up people and see if they're alive or dead.  And you're obviously alive.  So Obea won the beer because I thought you were dead.  Yeah.  Scooby dooby doo.  Scooby.  Oh my God.  Hey, we're talking to Scooby Doo.  Yeah.  How about some Scooby Snacks? 
[30:00]
 Hey, didn't you do the voice for Droopy Dog too?  Yes.  I'm droopy.  I'm so happy.  That is very good.  How about Astro?  Astro.  Uh, Verus words.  All right.  And one of my favorites, Ricochet Rabbit.  Ricochet Rabbit.  Uh, bing bing bing. 
[30:30]
 And Boo Boo.  Uh huh.  Hi.  My, my, my pal Yogi isn't here.  Uh, but he's probably, probably uh, uh, he better not be uh, picking up any uh.  Pickenick baskets.  Pickenick baskets, as he calls them. 
[31:00]
 Oh boy.  Hey uh, Boo Boo Bear, it sounds like you've been hitting a bottle.  Ranger, Ranger Smith.  Oh yeah.  Ranger Smith.  And all these voices live inside your head?  Oh yes indeed.  Uh, Papa Smith.  Oh man.  Hey, did you do any voices on the Flintstones?  Bang, bang, bang.  Oh well.  Well that's fantastic. 
[31:30]
 You're still doing really good.  Even after all those years, that's great.  Uh, hi.  You mean me?  Hmm?  Yeah, you.  Oh my god.  Well Mr. Scooby Doo, you won me a beer.  You're obviously alive.  Barely.  Shut up dude.  So Anthony owes me a beer.  I think I owe you half a beer.  Uh, little more Scooby?  Scooby Scooby Doo. 
[32:00]
 Well Scooby, thanks for spending a few minutes with us this afternoon.  What?  Excuse me?  Thanks for spending a few minutes with us this afternoon.  What am I doing this afternoon?  No, thanks for spending a few minutes with us this afternoon.  Oh.  Alrighty?  Alright.  Have a great day.  Oh okay.  Alright.  Oh that's just tragic.  Oh my god.  That is just tragic.  Ricochet Rabbit dead.  Bam Bam dead. 
[32:30]
 Scooby Dog dead.  Who did the voices for all of them?  Oh my.  I'm dead.  Isn't that a shame?  It is.  A piece of your childhood gone.  Alright well.  Aw, a little tribute now.  A little tribute.  Turned into a tribute.  Don Mezek.  Now that we know he's dead.  Hey Scooby!  Scooby Scooby Doo.  Looking for you.  Scooby Scooby Doo.  Where are you?  Over here.  Oh it's not a view.  Oh it's not a view.  Oh it's not a view.  Oh it's not a view.  Oh it's not a view.  Oh it's not a view.  Oh it's not a view.  Oh it's not a view.  Oh it's not a view.  You mean me? 
[33:00]
 Scooby Scooby Doo.  Scooby Scooby Doo.  Scooby Scooby Doo.  Someone change my diaper!  Boy Guy.  There he is.  Haunting tribute.  Hey Scooby!  Scooby Scooby Doo.  Scooby Scooby Doo.  Scooby Scooby Doo.  There he is.  Haunting tribute.  Hey Scooby, where are you? 
[33:30]
 Dead.  1027WNEW, The Rock of New York, Kenny Wayne Shepard, Blue on Black.  NEW has your tickets to see a taping of Kenny Wayne Shepard as part of VH1's Hard Rock Live.  And Dave Herman is going to start giving those tickets away tomorrow morning on his lovely program.  So, Pee and Anthony, you're staring at a computer screen over there, Ant.  Well, Chris Morwick says,  We're having an annual festival called the Apple Fest in our town on the 4th.  Opie, maybe you could show how pussy-whipped you are by coming up. 
[34:00]
 It's slightly better than picking pumpkins in Long Island and you don't have to worry about getting cancer.  I guess they've had a problem out there.  I bet you Chris has a girl and he has to deal with the same crap I do every weekend.  There are things that you have to deal with the girlfriend or wife, yes.  Where you want to have that threesome with those wild girls you met during the week, but you can't.  You have to do the right thing and spend a half hour trying to find the exit of a corn maze. 
[34:30]
 Opie, for most guys it's not a threesome.  It's a simple pleasure of maybe just getting out with your friends, playing some golf without catching any flack.  That's it. Once you're in a relationship, though, it's over.  Once you're in a relationship, it pretty much stinks.  Guys spend their lives up to the point where they're 18 or 20 or whatever it is being dictated by their parents.  Usually the mother is the one that's home most of the time, if the father is either at work or doesn't live in the house anymore, 
[35:00]
 with their mother telling them what to do their whole life.  They get out of the house for a couple of years, have some fun, and then what do they do?  They hook up with a woman that's going to tell them what to do now for the rest of their lives.  What are we, insane?  We are insane. But we all do it.  For most of us, anyway.  The ladies have a hold on us out there.  They do.  You know, me and Anthony Act are all tough on the radio and stuff, but...  No, we don't.  When your pals go home, we're pretty wimpy. We have no lives. That's why we like being right here. 
[35:30]
 It's like any other guy.  If no guy was, as I guess Chris put it, pussy-whipped, then we'd all be out all the time,  with all our pals drinking or out at the game or playing golf.  But it's always, what time is it?  Where's the phone? I've got to make a call.  We all talk a good game, too, but when it comes right down to it, we're whips.  Poopy, pussy-punking.  No, we're leaving right now, I swear. 
[36:00]
 Okay, snoop-poop.  Okay, I love you, too. Bye. Click.  I'm out the whole night, guys.  Told that geek where it's at. Put her in her place.  Yeah, you sure did, Anthony.  I'll be home soon, snoop-in.  Yes, how it is. There you go. I'm glad Chris noticed my hell that I'm in.  Pumpkin picking upy.  Yeah, it was real exciting. And then we went to the apple orchard and we got ourselves some warm apple cider. 
[36:30]
 Woo-hoo!  All right, Anthony, we need some ladies calling up, because we're bitching and complaining on the radio today  about how our weekends aren't that much fun because we'd rather be doing other things.  I didn't say that. I just said that's the situation we end up in.  See, that's the difference between me and you. I'm brave enough to admit it, and you're not.  No, here's the difference between me and you. See this on my finger?  Yeah.  It's a ring. It's a wedding ring.  I don't have one of those.  You don't have one. That's the difference.  All right.  So you're like, the unmarried guys are like the pilot in the jet plane, in the fighter plane, 
[37:00]
 and you have your eject handle if things really get bad.  Yeah.  When you're married, they weld it shut. You've got to go in with the plane regardless.  You've got to try to make it land.  Come on.  It doesn't matter if your wing's shot off or anything. They'll punch you out.  You can still get out. People get out all the time.  Oh, that's ugly. I made a commitment. I stick with it.  Sixty percent of the people that get married end up getting divorced, so you can get out.  Then why bother getting married?  I think it's a deeper problem than that. I want some ladies to call up and tell us what they expect.  All right. 
[37:30]
 On the weekends.  Okay.  All right?  We'll give them a chance today because we've done enough complaining and bitching.  It is the People's Show. Women want to call in. Sure.  We want to hear from some ladies in the next hour, so give us a call.  1027-W-N-A-W. The Rock of New York. You're hanging with Opie and Anthony.  Man, the phones are going nuts, man.  I know. We've got a ton of ladies on the line here.  Yeah. Once again, we sunk into relationships. It's just the way it happens when you're a guy.  The difference between what guys expect on their weekends and what we consider fun and hanging out, 
[38:00]
 and of course it can include the woman in our lives, and what women like in the weekends.  Yeah, it just seems like women kind of dictate what we do on weekends in general  and think we're going to have fun doing these lovely things.  Their tentative plans can turn into full-blown plans at a moment's notice.  Yes.  Our plans are crap and should just be thrown out for some reason. 
[38:30]
 Yeah, but I don't know. We can plunk any one of these down.  Hi, N-E-W. Hello?  Hi, what's going on?  Hi. I'm sitting here cooking dinner and I'm listening to N-E-W, which I always do.  And I just have to say, I mean, what you're saying is, Cole, and I hear a lot of my guy friends say the same thing.  Right.  I don't know who you guys are dating. I don't take offense to it because I find a lot of men who say the same thing about women.  Yeah.  But, you know, we sort of, like, it's kind of making us seem like we don't have lives or something, you know? 
[39:00]
 Well, something happens in the translation. I mean, I think every guy goes out with that girl and the sex is great and the times are wild.  And then all of a sudden it just kind of stagnates after a while.  And the next thing you know, you're going to hot air balloon festivals and you're picking pumpkins on a Saturday afternoon  and you're walking around in a goddamn corn maze.  No, but you guys...  See, I think if we take a right here, that's where the exit is.  You guys secretly want that.  And then afterward we'll reflect on a warm cup of apple cider. 
[39:30]
 What the hell happened in my life?  No, it was fun, hon, really. But I remember early in our relationship, Saturday afternoon,  we spent maybe having sex in between cars on the Long Island Railroad.  But nah, picking pumpkins is just as good.  Right.  Hey, honey, this year I'm going to carve my pumpkin into Cartman.  It's going to look just like Cartman.  I can't freaking wait.  So, you know...  My God, honey, it's our turn for the hay ride. 
[40:00]
 No, it's just as good. Remember we used to give each other oral favors at the movie theater when we first got together.  No, but it's just as good.  Something happens. I don't know what it is, but it happens.  I think it's more on the man's side, I have to say.  I just don't know what girls you guys are.  What is?  Honey, can't wait to go to the Arts and Crafts Festival this weekend.  So, you're saying...  But then when we offered to play golf...  I remember when you used to whittle my thing into a freaking skin flu. 
[40:30]
 No, see, you're so wrong.  Because when we're ready to go play golf, you guys are like, no, no way.  You can't play golf with us, you know?  It's just you guys want to keep it as divided as you want to keep it for some reason.  Wait a minute, that's not true.  And you know what? I'm not saying that's wrong either.  Because we have our own things.  We do our own things on the weekends because we know you couldn't care less about them.  Wow, look at, see, now you've got an opinion though that's a little biased the other way.  Of course, because we're not the same. 
[41:00]
 No, we're not. That's right, bingo.  That's it, guys and girls are not the same.  Absolutely not. And any woman who says that they are the same, they're completely lying through their teeth.  And don't trust that girl.  But the secret is keeping your independence and doing your own thing and letting them do it.  You know, letting you guys do your own thing.  So honey, really, I'll blow off the Jenna Jameson film festival on the Playboy channel.  No, we can pop in the Titanic video for the 10th time! 
[41:30]
 Ew, ew, who liked Titanic?  I'm ready to like lose, I don't know who liked that movie.  I'm just venting, no problem.  Yeah, I know you are. Well, you guys are dating the wrong girls and you're really, it's a total...  Look, Emma's on HBO Saturday night.  It's a stereotype. You guys are totally stereotyping.  I'm really psyched to see fried green tomatoes on HBO.  Still on Agnolia.  No, I know Discovery Channel's got something on the Harrier Jump Jet, but I really don't want to see that.  So what do you want to see? 
[42:00]
 I want to see some poof!  You think I want to see? That's what every guy wants to see.  No, they don't.  So what about all those guys who mope around that they don't have girlfriends?  And then the guys who do enjoy doing that stuff, all their friends snicker behind them and say, oh my god.  They're gay.  It is. Any guy that hangs out with a bunch of girls and they're doing anything besides sex, a lot, they're gay.  Really, are they? Is that true?  Yeah! 
[42:30]
 I just love to go out and dance with the ladies. It's fun. There's nothing, no pressure about sex or anything. Let's dance!  Of course.  Seriously?  For me, the time between orgasms is just passing the time and waiting.  Oh, okay. I would go to the asphalt.  Guys are so behind. In fact, I bought Men's Health Magazine and there's this thing about guys who, usually the girlfriends, that want sex more than the guys. 
[43:00]
 Huh.  Yeah, and it's a survey done in Men's Health Magazine this month.  All right.  I swear.  All right. I don't know. There's more ladies that want to talk to us, I guess, Anthony, huh?  Oh, cool. If you want to get in, 212-757-1027. Not one guy has called us. Now one guy is brave enough to put his voice on the air.  Poot!  Hey!  Poot!  We say it, pay later. That's our motto. Say now, pay later. Hi, NAW. 
[43:30]
 What's the deal?  You know, I just heard you finish saying that there are no guys willing to call up and state their opinion on the relationship deal.  Yes.  And so I thought I'd call and give my opinion on that.  Oh, real man. Okay. Let's hear it.  Well, it's pretty much like this. I think when relations start out, like you said, having sex between cars on the LIRR, everything's great and fine and dandy.  Then what happens is over time, a few months go by and the intensity starts to wane a little bit.  And then, you know, some of your clothes end up at her place and clothes of hers end up at your place. 
[44:00]
 And before you know it, you start feeling these obligations to start spending more time.  Once you decide that you actually are in a relationship, that's when the sort of unwritten or unsaid sort of indicators start popping up.  It's not like, you know, it's not like she'll turn around and she'll say outright, listen, you know, you can't go out with these guys.  You can't go out with those guys. It's not going to happen like that.  The way it happens is that she encourages you to go out. Of course I want you to go out, honey. That's fine. 
[44:30]
 Go and spend time with your friends.  But what inevitably happens is that you start to get these little hints that she's upset, that you didn't ask her to come with you.  Right? You didn't ask her to come with you. And then if you keep going out, right?  Because, you know, suddenly Friday, Saturday, you want to go out Friday night or Sunday, you want to watch football all day.  They can't understand how you can just sit in a bar for eight hours drinking beer and eating wings and not want her around.  And it's not that you don't want to spend time with her. It's just that you don't want to spend time with her at that moment. 
[45:00]
 You know what I mean?  They take it very personal.  But that's just that's one side of it. The other side of it.  It starts to be like, well, oh, you're going out again kind of attitude.  You know, it's sort of like, you know, we can, you know, you can go out, honey, but you're going to go out again.  Oh, you don't want to hang out tonight, you know, that kind of thing.  And then you say, well, OK. And that's when you know you're with when you've given him that.  And, you know, I just came out of a relationship myself. 
[45:30]
 So I know when you were talking about the corn maze, what the hell happened to my life?  So, you know, I thought, you know, I was there, man.  You know, I thought it was great.  How the hell did I end up picking pumpkins on Saturday afternoon?  How did it get to this?  I thought it was brilliant, man.  And yeah, I used to see how many shots I could do with my buds on a Saturday afternoon and still walk home.  Now I'm trying to figure out how many pumpkins I could hold in my hands for twelve bucks. 
[46:00]
 Well, that's the other thing.  You know, I think it's also the approach to plans that's so different between men and women.  Women approach plans. They're planning their weekend as of Monday.  Guys don't have to make plans.  You know, you figure same thing like with drinking.  You know, women will plan to get together and drink.  Guys just get together and end up drinking.  So it's not even an issue, you know.  And I don't plan to have a weekend.  Like, I'm not saying next weekend me and the guys are getting together.  So by default, the weekend falls to the girl. 
[46:30]
 Sure, no, because she's got the plan.  Right, plan.  She's ahead of you, man.  And you can't do it because we can't do anything until Thursday.  I figure Thursday is when you're going to start, you know, sizing up your weekend.  Exactly.  But no, I mean, hey, the brains just don't operate the same way.  And I don't think that women are, you know, conniving in any way.  I just think that the way they think and the way we think, we just end up missing each other.  And they get the upper hand over time.  And they are more patient than we are, I think, you know.  You make some great points. 
[47:00]
 Great job, man.  Very good.  Anyway, listen, I love your show.  You guys are great.  Since you guys have been on the air, we picked you up over here where I work and we listen to you every day.  Instant feedback from Bob in New Jersey.  I've been married two years.  Guess how long it's been since I've been to a bar on a weekend.  1027 WNEW, the Rock of New York, the latest from the Goo Goo Dolls.  That's slide off the Dizzy of the Girls CD.  It's Opie and Anthony running back into the studio.  I'm back.  How are you? 
[47:30]
 Well, we got to leave.  We're done already?  Yeah.  I mean, the phones are on fire.  Everyone wants to talk about relationships.  We should continue with tomorrow, maybe.  Yeah, we could do that.  So if you're on hold or trying to get through, you know, you could call us tomorrow.  Are you going to go, uh, what are you doing tonight?  Oh, going into another corn maze.  I mean, I'm sure it was all wonderful and everything, but what guy just alone or with his guy friends would be like, Hey, 
[48:00]
 hey, you want to go on the corn maze?  It'll be fun.  It's like corn and it's amazing.  We try to find a way out.  Right.  Come on, Bob.  Bill, come on.  And then you pay the two bucks and realize that like a three year old can make their way through it.  Man, some weekend.  Don't we, Popey?  It's okay.  All right.  You get to, you know, every so often go out with the guys, right? 
[48:30]
 I used to have naked twister parties with sorority girls and tell them in corn mazes.  Did you get some good pumpkins?  Yeah, I got a white one, a green one and a couple orange ones.  And you're going to carve them up for Halloween.  Oh, I held the cake stand record for my college.  Okay, I'm going to, I'm going to do this like concentration. 
[49:00]
 You know the game concentration only it's done with sound.  Okay.  I got this here.  Got earlier.  This is Opie.  What is this?  You hear that?  You getting it?  You're an ass.  Oh, your life is so much better.  Got an excuse.  I'm married.  Great. 
[49:30]
 All right.  We got to go though.  All right.  I mean, I want to talk about Saturday Night Live and how the Mets blew it.  There was so much stuff we couldn't get to today.  Wasn't Saturday Night Live great this past weekend?  Wow.  I think it was one of the best ever.  It was awesome.  Man, Tim Meadows almost made it through a skit this time without stumbling.  He almost did it.  You know what my favorite part was?  What Anthony?  See when they, when they did the, the two guys from the Roxbury. 
[50:00]
 Yeah.  And all of a sudden, you know, that skit kind of felt like it was brand new this time around.  You know, they should make a feature length motion picture about those guys because it's  so funny.  It's like the five, six or 15 minutes that the bit is long just isn't enough.  Yeah.  It isn't enough.  I sit through that for an hour and 40 minutes starting.  Oh, yeah.  I can't wait.  But my favorite part on SNL was the surprise.  See, when, when, when the crowd went away from the bar, who was there? 
[50:30]
 But the two wild and crazy guys, Dan Aykroyd and Steve Martin.  Well, I think it was them anyway.  Oh, freaking losers.  They don't even, they invented the characters and they didn't even do it.  They didn't even do it right.  Like Steve Martin's like, Hey, we are two wild and crazy guys.  Crazier guy.  Like, no way.  They're not doing the voice right.  Right.  And they're not moving like they used to.  It's like, I don't think they can.  Oh, it's like retire already.  Dan Aykroyd looked like, like Dan Aykroyd squared. 
[51:00]
 Yeah.  I think they had to make a bigger suit for him.  Yeah.  I don't think that was the suit he was wearing back in 1978 or whatever.  We are two fat and old guys.  And somehow it just didn't hold up over 30 years.  Yeah, but no, it was a great episode.  I really, really enjoyed it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was, it was wonderful.  One redeeming value.  Hmm.  Cameron Diaz.  Nips.  Doesn't believe in bras.  I know.  Neither does.  I've heard that it does a facey from Smashing Pumpkins. 
[51:30]
 Get it?  I know.  You know, not that like Howard needs the help, but I got to mention something here.  Those, those two idiots from that skit that are going to be in the movie A Night at the  Roxbury.  Oh yeah.  They think Howard's show sucks.  Right.  And they're not scared of him.  And I like to do nothing but make fun of Howard as much as possible.  I think you better wait until you see what the receipts are for your movie. 
[52:00]
 Exactly.  They're saying Howard's show is not entertaining and they're doing a movie that's an hour and  40 minutes long where they move their heads back and forth from side to side.  I think a lot of people did switch in, you know, back and forth between SNL and Howard  on Saturday.  Yeah.  So.  Alan Manson wasn't bad.  That was cool.  Yeah.  I watched the Howard show.  So.
