<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a brief, nonsensical conversation about time, quickly transitioning into reminiscing about past on-air arguments and a listener-driven Brady Bunch trivia segment.  The hosts then launched into their annual "Whip-Em-Out Wednesday" ("WOW") segment, showcasing listener-submitted photos of women exposing their breasts while driving.  A substantial portion of the show was dedicated to listener emails and calls detailing various sexual acts, using humorous, often crudely descriptive nicknames like "Greek Picasso," "Rusty Trombone," "Pinchpot Mudworks," and "Chili Dog." One listener shared a humorous anecdote about a failed attempt at the "Rusty Trombone."

The show then tackled a significant legal controversy: a court case deeming the Pledge of Allegiance unconstitutional due to the inclusion of "under God."  This sparked a heated debate with callers expressing diverse viewpoints, ranging from staunch patriotism and support for the pledge to criticism of its religious implications and the legal challenge.  The discussion included profuse vulgar language and strong opinions, occasionally veering into unrelated topics like immigration and political correctness. Several callers shared personal anecdotes about their experiences with the Pledge in schools.

The broadcast continued with a rambling discussion on gun control, focusing on the Second Amendment and firearm accessibility, leading to a "Celebrity Gunfire" segment attempting to get a celebrity on-air to fire a gun.  A caller's complaint about the removal of the Lord's Prayer and the national anthem from schools triggered another discussion on immigration and American patriotism, punctuated by a humorous story about booing the Canadian national anthem at a hockey game.  A caller's frustration with Cablevision's lack of English-language broadcasts was followed by a conversation with a conservative black Republican discussing the challenges of being a minority within the Republican party and perceived liberal paternalism.  The controversy surrounding the word "niggardly" was debated, along with the overemphasis on participation trophies in youth sports and a critique of modern parenting.  Comedian Rich Vos, present in the studio, contributed off-mic commentary, golf-related discussions and boasts, and engaged in a contentious exchange with a caller.  The hosts repeatedly mentioned the "WOW" contest, particularly a chaotic segment involving a Cleveland-based participant whose photo shoot was interrupted by a police raid.  Numerous other calls further contributed to the show's chaotic and fast-paced nature.

Further discussion revolved around Rich Vos' upcoming golf game at Bethpage Black, with jokes about his chances of breaking 100. Opie detailed a recent sexual encounter, emphasizing the lack of cuddling.  A planned Penthouse interview with Vos and its comedic potential were discussed.  More "WOW" contest submissions were featured, and a caller, "Frenchie," engaged in a heated and highly offensive argument with the hosts.  A female caller, Irene, criticized the show's treatment of women, prompting another offensive exchange. Irene revealed her boyfriend's recent death from a heart attack, leading to a discussion and an apology from Opie, although the banter continued with further offensive language. Several other unidentified individuals participated in the studio conversations.

A subsequent segment featured a phone call with Irene, still distraught over her fiancé's death.  The conversation became a bizarre and highly offensive exchange, with insensitive and crude remarks about her fiancé, appearance, and emotional state. Exaggerated sound effects were used, including cries for help and simulated pain. A caller played a video game sound effect during the call.  The "WOW Contest" was discussed again, and a caller named "Alan" from the University of New Orleans engaged in similarly offensive banter. The show concluded with further riffing on the earlier call and other unrelated topics, including a movie Anthony saw and upcoming show events, all punctuated by frequent profanity and highly inappropriate jokes.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Today was yesterday, because yesterday was so close, like almost like it was the same day.  I hear ya.  That's right.  And welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show.  A couple phone numbers in the New York City area, 877-692-1027.  Outside of New York City, 866-277-4WOW.  Wow.  866-277-4WOW.  On the way, Brady Bunch trivia, Anthony.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  No. 
[00:00:30]  Oh, one of the only bits we do.  Brady Bunch trivia on the way.  Boy, that was...  In between talking about TNA, we'll be doing lots and lots of Brady Bunch trivia.  That was some retrospective.  Yeah, the rest of the country's missing out.  We got the 2 o'clock hour here in New York City that we do just for New York City.  Yeah.  And we were replaying some fine and fond memories today.  Wasn't that a pisser?  The old days of this station that went on in New York.  They were playing old butt rock music, and we had a little argument with the DJ that came on after us. 
[00:01:00]  It was very funny.  Well, they missed its announce.  Yeah.  But during the argument, she said that all we do on our show is Brady Bunch trivia.  I guess we did that that day.  I don't know.  We ever actually played that game?  I don't know.  Well, I think there was a time where the listeners challenged you.  Yeah, I think that was pretty much it.  To Brady Bunch trivia.  It wasn't really a segment or anything. 
[00:01:30]  People just would call up, and they would try to stump you.  Try to stump me.  They would try to stump your Brady Bunch knowledge.  Yeah.  Oh, well.  Come a long way, I guess, right?  Not really.  There seems to be a guy named Eric that's associated with another radio show that desperately wants to come in here.  He wants to come on? 
[00:02:00]  Why not?  He doesn't have the balls to come on the air.  See what he's all about.  But he loves us, he says.  Yeah.  He loves us.  He loves us.  Well, it's Whip-Em-Out Wednesday, Anthony.  Yes, it is.  That old gag.  It's an old gag that's been working, though.  It's an old gag that works real well.  People seem to enjoy seeing lovely women wearing their breasts.  Do you realize this is either the seventh or eighth summer of WOW?  Stop it.  Already?  Let me think.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wow.  Oof. 
[00:02:30]  It's easy.  You put the WOW on the vehicle, and when you're driving around and a girl sees it,  sees the WOW on your vehicle, and she feels so inclined,  and she'll pull her shirt up, show you her lovely cannage on the way home.  And this thing has taken on a life of its own, obviously.  So we'll be doing a little of that today.  Also, I got a couple emails I want to read right off the bat here.  Yeah.  I'll start with the easy one.  This is from Christy.  She writes, Opie and Anthony,  some friends were in Atlantic City last weekend, 
[00:03:00]  and they were propositioned by a prostitute  that offered them a Greek Picasso for only 60 bucks.  She wants to know,  any idea what this sexual delicacy might be?  A Greek Picasso.  We've heard of a lot of these things.  I've never heard of the Greek Picasso.  Well, if it's Greek,  it must involve the balloon knot,  the backdoor action we're talking.  That's always the Greek. 
[00:03:30]  You ever see the blow-up doll?  The boxes say,  Authentic Greek Features?  Yeah.  That means it has a bung.  That means it has the back,  the back way.  But the Picasso thing,  I can only think,  judging from my knowledge of Picasso paintings,  that it might be something  either coming out of the balloon knot,  maybe it's like a Cleveland steamer,  or a hot lunch,  or a hot Carl.  You're just guessing, though.  I'm guessing. 
[00:04:00]  I'm just guessing.  I'm speculating.  The Chicago hot plate.  Chicago hot plate?  I don't know.  I'm just trying to be local today.  So does anyone know  what the Greek Picasso is?  There's got to be a definition for that one.  We've heard of the donkey punch.  We've heard of just about all of them.  Yeah.  But the Greek Picasso,  that's Greek to me.  Never heard of that one.  Tell you the truth,  and the instant feedback  isn't helping us yet.  The delay has to kick in.  All right.  So let that settle in, 
[00:04:30]  in your old brain.  And kind of on the same subject,  you know how we used to talk about  the rusty trombone a lot, Anthony?  Oh, of course.  Now that's a favorite.  Yeah, well,  in case you don't know  what a rusty trombone is,  why don't we go to this  quick little song here.  All right.  Just to catch everyone up, okay?  This is a really funny email,  by the way.  A rusty trombone is best with a filthy whore. 
[00:05:00]  She'll reach around and get you off with her hand.  All the while she'll lick your spot  by your tiny balloon nut.  Hope you didn't eat too much bread.  A rusty trombone may not be moral.  While I think this sounds kind of gay, 
[00:05:30]  I'd rather get some oral  with the finger up my butt.  But that's me.  What the hell?  I'm not.  Come on, honey.  Start the music.  They didn't jump out of that, right?  I hope not.  Oh, God.  Did they jump out of that?  Nope.  Okay, that was a close one.  Well, just in case you don't know  what a rusty trombone is yet,  we used to be obsessed with this stupid thing.  It's the, um, the, uh...  Well, I got another song.  Oh, another song? 
[00:06:00]  Which one is this?  Now you're doing the rusty trombone.  Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.  If you don't know how to do it,  I'll show you there's nothing to it.  Show them you can play all night.  Grab that horn, hold it tight.  Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.  Put your lips right on the pole.  Jetman, Al, don't be too bold.  Slide it to the left and right.  Blow on it with all your mind.  Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.  You'll get horny if you play your horn alone. 
[00:06:30]  So get behind me and blow on my trombone.  Stroke you in and out, my friend,  while you blow the other hand.  You don't need no saxophone.  Now you're doing the thrombone.  The thrombone.  So tell them that you like this horn  and you can play it all night long.  Get right down and blow it to you  underneath that big old room.  Now it's time to turn around and let your partner go to town. 
[00:07:00]  Get on your knees, give a cheer.  Dirty Sanchez, time is here.  The tanks get rusted when they are not used.  So grab my testings and use a lot of mood.  Use a lot of mood.  Stroke the in and out, my friend, while you blow the other end.  You don't need no saxophone.  Now you're doing russi trombone.  Russi trombone, russi trombone, russi trombone, russi trombone, russi trombone, russi trombone, russi trombone, russi trombone, russi trombone, russi trombone, russi trombone, russi trombone, russi trombone, russi trombone, russi trombone, russi trombone, russi trombone, russi trombone, russi trombone, russi trombone, russi trombone, russi trombone, russi trombone, russi trombone, russi trombone, russi trombone, russi trombone, russi trombone, russi trombone, russi trombone, russi trombone, russi trombone 
[00:07:30]  I don't understand what the rusty trombone is, Anthony.  I hope so.  It's a little stimulation of the balloon knot with the tongue. 
[00:08:00]  And then as the girl is doing this, which is the sickest part, the girl is the one performing it on the guy.  Yes.  She has to give the reach around and work the junk like a trombone.  It's like you're blowing into.  And I guess the rusty part is maybe the mouthpiece seems a little rusty, you know?  It might leave some residue.  It is probably the sickest thing.  I mean, I could not even fathom. 
[00:08:30]  Now, what's the other one, the mud?  The Pinchpot Mudworks.  Pinchpot Mudworks is the same thing, only a guy performing a girl.  He's, you know, in the mud, yet he's pinching the pot.  You know what I mean?  Give the reach around Pinchpot Mudworks.  I think that's an ONA original, by the way.  I've never heard of that one before.  Never, ever heard.  I think your brother came up with that.  Pinchpot Mudworks. 
[00:09:00]  My favorite has got to be the Chili Dog.  The Chili Dog?  Oh, is that after you're done tapping the balloon nut, you take it, and then she eats?  Let's just say that the balloon nut does what balloon nuts do.  Right.  And it's like, you know, some things in life are very solid.  Other things in life are liquidy and messy.  That's the way things are.  Sometimes if something is liquidy and messy, which could be anything, from a balloon nut,  if it happens to be on your chest, and then you push the T's together, and you T.F. 
[00:09:30]  Oh, I got you, then.  That's a Chili Dog.  It looks like a Chili Dog with the bun, the hot dog, and all that scrumptious chili around it.  Get a good one.  Get a good one.  Don't drop it.  Fill it to the tippy top.  Anyway, so this email came in today.  We forgot all about the rusty trombone.  It's been a while.  We're not as obsessed with the rusty trombone lately.  But this lady, Ann, wrote us, and God, I hope I could clean this up for the radio. 
[00:10:00]  All right.  My boyfriend Jay told me about a rusty trombone a few months ago when he heard about it on your show.  He's sort of been daring me ever since by bringing it up every now and then.  Well, this weekend, as usual, Jay stayed over, and we had our Sunday morning romp.  I had him buttered up with some banana emotion lotion, which I worked in and around in preparation for the Dirty D.  Ah.  So far, so good, right?  I guess.  I stood him up because that usually helps him. 
[00:10:30]  Okay, whatever.  Helps him late.  It's all right.  Take your time.  He's standing.  I think she's praying.  Oh, okay.  All right.  So she stood him up for, and he was assuming that she was going to get ready to pray.  All right.  Does that kind of make sense?  Yes, it does.  Okay.  He never suspected a thing because this is what they usually do.  Uh-huh.  It's a big turn on for him to be standing while she's praying.  Right.  Okay. 
[00:11:00]  So he's just assuming it's like business as usual.  After a few minutes, I asked him to get down on his knees as I was trying to sneak around behind him.  And he became suspicious and was turning his, his, uh, his, uh, you know what?  We all know what it is, right?  Yeah.  Because if I say the word, then they're going to start dumping.  Uh, so he was turning his, uh, his back half away from me, trying to get away from me until I was on my knees chasing after him as we traveled in circles like a couple of idiots. 
[00:11:30]  Like two dogs when they meet in the street.  You know how the one doesn't want it sniffed?  And they'll just start going around in circles at each...  Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh 
[00:12:00]  so she continues  so my hot shot boyfriend who talked about it and dared me for months  turned into a total chicken when it came to face the music  that's not a chicken  sincerely and  well no he was the one who brought it up in the relationship  so she was all scared but assumed well this is something he wants 
[00:12:30]  she finally gets brave enough to do it  realizing that he no he doesn't want it at all  it was just more of a joke  so she's trying to get behind him and he  he just keeps turning in circles  hey hey  so they're naked in the bedroom just going around in circles  i'll tell you something though  in that situation if the guy suggested it  and then she all of a sudden spontaneously tries to do it  i don't know  there's a lot of variables back there  you know what i mean  like if he wanted to have it done  he probably would have liked a little advance notice that it was coming that 
[00:13:00]  night  and then be able to get in and sit on a belt sander or something  just to you know  you gotta really clean that up  get in the shower a lot of scrubbing  so he could call in the uh... cleaning crew  call in the cleaning crew  you know it's that room in the house that not many people visit  no so the guys come in with their big suits  yeah like outbreak  you gotta clean up  you might have a guest room in your house that you'll use for storage  no one ever sees it 
[00:13:30]  so you let it get a little unruly  and then if you have company just drop by  you're not gonna put them in that room  unexpected company  i hear ya  you want them to call  let you know they're coming so you can clean the room out  that way their stay will be a little more comfortable  that room gets a little uh...  stanky  a little musty  a little musty  a little dusty  a lot of dust on things  you wanna clean it up  clear it out  set it up nice and open a few windows to air it out a little bit  might wanna put on a coat of paint 
[00:14:00]  a new coat of paint  meanwhile  it's the same room  but it's a lot nicer than if you had it all full of junk and garbage  it's still part of that beautiful house of yours with all the brand new rooms  you take care of your house  yeah  you have to  you take care of everything the front rooms the back rooms every  but there's that one room  sometimes it gets a little unruly  and you don't want unexpected company  but hell a lot of uh...  a lot of people aren't going in that room  no  you just keep the door locked and no one notices 
[00:14:30]  that's why  and then unexpectedly someone wants to use the room  no  you can't have unexpected guests in that room  no no  my friend  this isn't true  was having  that done  I guess he hadn't prepared properly  oh no  this is true  and he's a pig  he always wants it done  he's always like go ahead do it  do it  oh my god  yeah that's sick  and as she's doing it he hears  ha ha ha ha ha ha ha  little paper 
[00:15:00]  now see  you don't want paper  that's something for girls and guys  let me tell you something ladies  oh I'm so happy  the guys don't like the paper  you guys  I know there's uh... quite a few nooks and crannies in places  but  there's  you know if there's ever a little balled up piece of paper  alright now you get me  you don't want that  I was with you at the guest room man let's relax now  no  pfff  there is a reality  you don't want it  there's a reality there  and if you spill something in the guest room  eh  then you leave it there 
[00:15:30]  you can't leave it there  eh  you don't leave it  you don't have enough money to clean up the guest room  no  you're too busy cleaning the rest of the house  you spill something in the guest room  you know what could happen  it could sink through the floor and end up in another room  eh  you don't want that happening  but until that happens you just kinda let it go  you just let it be  there are certain areas  that are meant to be left alone  or need a lot of advanced warning  but sometimes you know it's  it's  it's good to have grandma in the guest room 
[00:16:00]  wait a minute  are we still talking about the same room  what room are you talking about  eh  you put her in the guest room cause she doesn't know  she doesn't notice anything  you can't let grandma go in the guest room  no way  although grandma's guest room is nice to sit in once in a while  nice to sit in once in a while  it's all musty and dry and dusty  she's old she doesn't know you're even in there  just sneak in while she's sleeping  see some of her old curios  she left about some bric-a-brac 
[00:16:30]  stay for a while you leave something on the floor  you leave she wakes up and she thinks she fell  I must have slipped in some glue  could have been  oh my god  so keep grandma out of the guest room  yeah  everyone should be kept out of that  little storage room  that's not a thing that  I've ever  ever thought of  what if you have a wife that doesn't want to go in the guest room  but um 
[00:17:00]  you have a neighbor  that wants to go in the guest room  hmm  then you don't even have to clean it up  if she's willing to go in  she knows what she's going to get herself into  alright  alright we got a break  man  that's funny though  thanks for that letter F  there shouldn't be any girl  I can't understand a girl really wanting to do that  unless you're talking about a young Asian boy or something  it's just too crazy  it's just crazy back there

[00:24:00]  brush  brush  they're dim witted at times  but I think  so are we all  yes but I think  in this instance  yeah  they get it  alright  Jesus  alright  well here we go  Joanna from Philly  another reason people suck  from CNN dot com  pledge of allegiance declared unconstitutional  San Francisco California  for the first time ever  a federal appeals court declared the pledge of allegiance unconstitutional Wednesday 
[00:24:30]  because of the words under God added by Congress in 1954  the ninth u.s. circuit court of appeals to the phrase amounts to a government endorsement of religion  in violation of the constitutions establishment clause which requires a separation of church and state  this son of a bitch  discuss  the case  brought by Michael A. Newdow  a Sacramento atheist  who objected because his second grade daughter was required to recite the pledge at the Elk Grove School Elementary School 
[00:25:00]  the federal judge dismissed his lawsuit but the ninth circuit court ordered the case proceed to trial  here's his logic  I'm an American citizen  I don't like my rights infringed upon by my government  now he called the pledge a religious idea that certain people don't agree with  his rights are infringed 
[00:25:30]  first of all  if you're an atheist  and you have your nine-year-old daughter  how about uh  you know  let her run through the motions in school  do what the little school children do  when I was going to school at Washington Drive  yes  in that fine town of Centerport  when uh  when the um  when the uh  you know  the dot heads and stuff  uh huh  didn't want to do the Pledge of Allegiance  the uh  the teacher would escort them out of the  the classroom for a little bit  oh really?  and then bring them back in  that's still too PC for me 
[00:26:00]  yeah  well  stand up  for the god damn Pledge of Allegiance  you get through it  it's it's  two minutes  not even  and then you're done with it  it's a Pledge of Allegiance  to our fine nation  and uh  the the fact that the words under God are in there  don't worry about it  I'm not sitting there thinking we're in some kind of a religious fanaticism government over here  that those are the people that fly planes in the building  it's just a nice little thing to add  do I believe in you know 
[00:26:30]  the white bearded God type thing and the whole story  no I probably don't  but  it's part of the Pledge  just do it  give us a sense of unity  right  like we're all one  under God  we are the  the nation  under sky  yeah  under cloud  under a  giant creator  even  under the rainbow  right?  yes  a  big  creator thing 
[00:27:00]  on a daily basis we have to say things and do things we don't agree with  mm-hmm  and as far as San Francisco which is an absolute asshole of a liberal stupid town  oh yeah  this is the same dump where transsexual operation and sexual reassignment is covered by medical benefits  but don't say God in the classroom that whole city sucks  mm  it sucks  you're taking it out on the whole city because of this idiot?  whatever  all of that  where else would you expect it to come from? 
[00:27:30]  where else would you expect it to come from?  and most people that are listening to this show wouldn't agree with that anyway  believe me  most fans of this show don't have that mentality  let's go to Andrew  hey Andrew what's up?  hey what's going on guys  hey  hey listen I was listening to uh... watching Fox News and they had a telephone interview with this uh...  new new dow guy  yeah  in the lawsuit  yeah  and uh... the reporter's asking him if he's worried about the safety of his family  yeah  and he says oh yeah I am  but then the reporter asks well what are you doing about it  the guy says  well I'm hoping and praying and nothing happens 
[00:28:00]  he's an atheist and he's praying  you'll see this guy get the crap beat out of him  he's praying now  he's praying now to God because there are some lunatics out there  yep  that are as effed up as he is but on the other end of the spectrum  that are probably going to kill this guy  I think this guy just found God  yeah he just found God  when some holy roller is pounding his face in  the same type of people that shoot up abortion clinics  those kooks  uh... then he's going to find God believe me  alright thanks guys 
[00:28:30]  why are we worried about this now?  I'm so tired of the constitution being quoted  that's another thing why are we even bothered  tying up the courts with this  well the timing on this is pretty bad too  with everything we're going through as a nation  it is such a constitution  I'm so tired of hearing about people's rights  we have our rights  enough already  can't look at a certain group of people in airports  because of their rights  I'm supposed to hit a building because of something written by  some douchebag slave owner in a white wig?  no  it's aggravating  hey Mike who's a teacher 
[00:29:00]  what's up Mike?  hey how are you?  good  good good good  the problem is as a teacher in Queens  I have a  all the time students are just not standing  they just refuse to stand  of course  and say the pledge  that's my problem  if you don't want to say the pledge  you don't have to  that's fine  you know all  without quoting the constitution  that's what we're guaranteed though  you don't have to believe it  but at least  they should be forced I think to stand  we all  that's just natural  common respect  we all stood 
[00:29:30]  but our hand over our hearts  oh absolutely  and looked at that flag  and we took it very seriously  without question  I didn't even know what I was saying until I got into the older grades  it was just this  blah blah  it might as well have been  blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah  the fact of the matter was  the teacher  was telling me to do it  and you respected your teacher  so you stood up and you did it  and I think  that's more important than  even what the words in it say  is just the respect for the teacher  and for the institution of a school 
[00:30:00]  a school  and your country  and for the country that you're staying in  even if you don't support it  if you don't like the views  look  it's protecting you  you're living there  you should actually  you know  your kids are in Queens?  yes  I bet you  that half of the scumbag kids  it all comes down to bad parenting  as usual  half of these little vultures  who won't stand  are the same ones  who don't mind  pledging their love for the government  when it comes to sucking free food  and free medical care  you effing 
[00:30:30]  dirtbag savages  I don't even know who your students are  I don't care where they're from  it just aggravates me  half of their parents  are probably single parents  but he started this argument by going  you're from Queens  ok  so now you're saying  that San Francisco stinks  no no no  and all welfare recipients  live in Queens  not at all  I was establishing  that he was in New York  like calling from New York  saying  it doesn't matter where you're from  that no  you know what  you're right though  don't stand up  I'm not standing up  and I'm not reciting this 
[00:31:00]  yet yeah  when the government gravy train rolls around  yeah  the question is  what do you do when you're in the room alone  or with other teachers  do you stand up  or with  if you're  in the station  let me tell you something  people are getting crazy  with stuff like this  the kids in school  should god damn stand up  and recite the friggin thing  not even what it means  it's part of  it's almost a discipline thing  it's a organizational thing 
[00:31:30]  it teaches more than just the words of it  it's a thing that  it's a community thing  you know what I mean  absolutely  there's a whole bunch of things that goes to  a teacher  saying for their students to do something  and have them as a group  stand up and do it  it teaches a lot more than just the words of the pledge  what about you  what about their individuality  i think that's important  that's great when you get home  what about the individuality  you can have individuality  but you have to stand  I mean it's just respect  of course you should stand 
[00:32:00]  you don't have to pledge  you could think about  you know  whatever  eminem or whatever you want to think about  but  you have to stand  you gotta show the country a little respect everyone  we're doomed as a nation  we are doomed  this nation is  on the road to ruin  I don't know how long a road it is  but we are doomed  we're going in a direction  that can only end up  in this country becoming so weak  that it either collapses in on itself  or another power at some point gets strong enough  to kick our ass 
[00:32:30]  but we are heading in that direction  there's no more  of that  as a backbone of patriotism in the country anymore  that really  holds it together  and there's too many outside forces  that are now in this country  that  to kind of get in between what holds it together  did the ACLU have anything to do with this?  I'm sorry?  oh I'm sure they were right on board with this guy  yeah I didn't read the article  but without even reading it  you can know that they had  somehow had their stupid  filthy mitts involved in it  yeah  bastards  alright Mike thank you 
[00:33:00]  hey have a good one guys  okay  ciao  this guy is really pissed on what I want  let's go to Mike  another Mike  hey Mike what's up?  I'm not really pissed  I got a lot to say there  I'll go for that  and I like to talk to all you little kids out there  who aren't standing up to the Pledge of Allegiance  and not really speaking English  and enjoying your little life as it goes  I tell you  drive me crazy  even for people to declare  the Constitution  to declare the fact that the Pledge of Allegiance  is unconstitutional  that should be declared un-American  number one  yeah  I don't want to seem right  I don't want to seem right  I don't want to seem right 
[00:33:30]  but I don't want to seem right  but it's you know  I want to say like I said  I have more to say than anything else  well dude you're right  and it's unhip to be like patriotic now  because everything  everybody in society is like  the pseudo wannabe  individuality hipster  and it's all based in that stupid dishonest  uh...  need to stand out  and they think it's hip to just  you know I don't pledge man  I don't stand for anything man  you know you're right  they're scumbags  now you come to this country  you see the way it is  you see people with money  you see other people doing their thing  but you know what  we've seen your country  okay  we've been to all your countries  Europe  we've been everywhere 
[00:34:00]  your country sucks  okay  pay attention to the way we do things  okay  this country has been doing things right  for a long time  and it's so great  the reason you want to come here  is because of the way we do things  okay  pay attention to the way we do stuff  and we don't ask for much  if you come to this country  you know  we don't even ask you to  learn the language anymore  yeah and that's ridiculous  there was a time  you came here  and if you didn't know English  you were pretty effed  I was watching TV the other day  I'm like oh  Yankees are on  Spanish Broadcast  Jesus 
[00:34:30]  when did this start?  how was it?  I don't know  I couldn't tell who was winning  a Spanish Broadcast  of a Yankee game  we're unraveling  just making it easier  for these people  that don't feel like  learning the language  you're supposed to have pride  for where you come from  you're supposed to have respect  for your culture  and what's wrong  if you tell foreigners  look man  we just want to learn the language  right  it's not completely correct  tough ass  tough ass  you know  you watch TV 
[00:35:00]  now  there's news stations  from all over the world  speaking all sorts of crap  I don't know  they might be calling in  bombs right now  we don't even know anymore  who knows  who's paying attention  I got a station  on my cable system  it's like  the Islamic news  I think  oh my god  I don't even know what it is  you know it's just code words  going out everyday  who knows  and you know  the cable companies  they're laughing at the cable companies  they don't even know  we're calling  communicating to all these  filthy rats  and using religion 
[00:35:30]  to get out the constitution  we're going to worry about mosques  we're going to worry about  all the privacy  that you have  these are issues  that people are using  to take us down  at this point in time  these are not issues  that should be standing  we should be coming together  we shouldn't be finding ways  to stay separate  and no one said to  let's say we replace  the pledge of allegiance  god forbid  with something else  to show like unity  in this country  where okay  alright this wasn't good  so we're going to  we're going to give you guys this  and we want you to stand  no matter what we try to do  we want to stand out  there'll be a reason why  I'd say it's no good 
[00:36:00]  yeah we can't be paranoid  we were paranoid  about nine months ago  about a couple of Arabian guys  we should have stopped up in Boston  we should have been a little paranoid  but we were too nervous  about being politically correct  that we didn't stop these F's  and that was a problem  we can't go back into that problem  we can't be as  we can't be nervous  thinking about ourselves  we're going to be  thinking about our own lives  I mean it's a  pride in your life  there's something going on there  become Americans  we'll fix this problem  you know what I mean  alright I hear you  here's how these  these liberal  pantywaists  just use the Constitution  to get what they want 
[00:36:30]  and meanwhile normal people  I'm not talking  right wing conservatives  because I'm not one of those  and I'm not a pantywaist liberal  I have my own mind  that I make up  but this guy Mike  from Jersey  you guys should know more  about your First Amendment  many goes quoting  the First Amendment  about how Congress  shouldn't make laws  respecting an establishment  of religion  blah blah blah  which if you take it verbatim  probably is a good argument  for not having  the God word  in the pledge  but 
[00:37:00]  these are the same  mother effers  that have  destroyed  the Second Amendment  for some reason  the Second Amendment  you can twist and turn  and bend  to keep guns  out of people's hands  but  the First Amendment  is  that's the one  where they say  well  you have God  in the Pledge of Allegiance  no one's taking it seriously  like  like they're saying  you have to  pray to this one God  to be in this country  it's just word  that's in the pledge 
[00:37:30]  deal with it  and half of these dirtbags  that are quoting  the First Amendment  it's all about freedom  they're the first ones  that want to ban  hate speech  they're the first ones  that are politically correct  well you can't say that  they're the ones who wanted  that guy fired  for using the word niggardly  even though it's a bad choice  of words  there's the same mentality  that goes into that  well it's all about freedom  of speech  they're the same douchebags  that want to hyphenate everything  and ban hate speech  so they're inconsistent dirtbags  alright we got a lady  that disagrees with us  Chris what's up?  I guess I'm one of those 
[00:38:00]  liberal pantyways  that you're talking about  alright  but I'm  I'm a regular listener  and  I'd have to say  ten years ago  I wasn't standing for the pledge  in high school  and I don't do it today  and if somebody doesn't  want to stand for it  you know  I think it's worse to stand  when you don't believe  in what they're saying  than to sit  why wouldn't you believe  and what is it that  you don't believe  in that they're saying  that is so  so powerful  that you must  protest it  by not standing  what did you object to?  what was the part 
[00:38:30]  that you objected to?  I'll let you  under god  I'm an atheist  ok  you're an atheist  now  so you don't believe  in any god  or any higher power  or anything  no  you felt that you needed  to take a stand  um  I felt that I needed  to not take a stand  why would I stand  to pretend I believe  in something  just to make it easier  for everybody else  wait wait  I'm not being literal  take a stand  I'm not doing a pun  I'm saying  just you needed  to somehow  make your point known 
[00:39:00]  why is it that important  that under  under god  ok  under god  under what most people  not you  but what most people  assume is a higher power  a god  a force  an alien  whatever you want  to think of  a god  they didn't specify  they just said  under god  what made you  so pissed off  that you decided  you were now  going to make a stand  against the pledge  you know  I wasn't angry  about it at all  it was more a matter 
[00:39:30]  that to me  standing hypocritical  when you don't believe  in what you're standing for  and I mean  my parents are not  liberal  my parents are  basic moderate  and you know  two parent nuclear households  so that suits the single parent  welfare family  down the  down the  I didn't say  I didn't say it applied  to every person  I just said that was a good case  it doesn't shoot it down  alright  I just hope she's liberal enough  to bring home a criminal  to date  and drive her father to death  the bottom line is  I bet when you weren't  No I dated women  a woman 
[00:40:00]  that drives me crazy enough  are you gay?  yeah  ok of course  of course  no no no no  no no no no  because you're that alternative  and you had to stand out  and you wanted them all  to notice that you were  taking a stand in class  it's based in that  dishonest BS  about being a  standout hipster  that's all it is  it's that mentality  not so much about  your belief  but so much about  how you want to present  yourself  and be that rebel  so predictably  unestablishment  oh lord I was no rebel  I'm a big nerd  so predictably  anti-establishment man 
[00:40:30]  hold on  there's two issues here  like I don't  it doesn't make me happy  but I don't mind  that she doesn't want to  stand for the Pledge of Allegiance  that's her prerogative  whatever  but I can't believe  that it's going a step further  and now it's being taken away  from everybody  once again the minority  rules in this country  right  it's never  the majority does not  rule this country anymore  it's always a special interest group  that gets something like this done  and it's not  and they don't give a flying app  that the majority of the country 
[00:41:00]  is probably pissed off  that this is going down  but you know what  tough ass for us  we lose again  and because you know  it's always the minority  that gets their way  in this country  it's not gay people  that are the problem  I don't mean that  it's the problem is when  it's a lobby group  or any type  like you know that Mother's Day  was not allowed to be celebrated  in Upper West Side Grammar School  because some of them  were gay parent homes  so none of the kids  could celebrate Mother's Day  because of the lifestyle choices  of certain parents  which they should be able to adopt  so I got no problem  with gay adoption  but don't ruin it 
[00:41:30]  for kids whose parents  are whatever  exactly  once again  the minority ruling  I mean okay  so instead of  you know  hold on  hold on  hold on  so instead of let's say  let's just throw numbers out there  five or six kids  feeling a little awkward in school  because you know  they can't really celebrate  Mother's Day  the traditional way  alright  so while this isn't  this isn't fair for these five  these five students  so we're going to take it away  now  twenty five thirty other kids  in the class that are now  are now suffering  that don't get to celebrate 
[00:42:00]  yeah  how does that  how does that ever make  was that the administration  of the school  who wouldn't just let the moms come  how does that ever make  how does that make sense though  that the minority once again  determines what  we should and  shouldn't do  the minority didn't determine that  the school did  of course  the minority determined it  not  not all the  the parents in the school  were gay  yes  just a very small percentage  for two moms to show up  because they buckled under  because yes  two people showed up  that would have made a big mess  in the news about how  anti-gay the school is 
[00:42:30]  if they didn't eliminate  Mother's Day celebration  because there's always those  people  those two or three people  that'll mail out their letterhead  and make a big stink  and boycott  and get on the news  to get their way  meanwhile their way  is a tenth of a one percent  of the way  everybody else would like it  that's what it is  there's a minority out there  that's trying to shut down  radio shows like that  nice right  you know and then  and you know I  I think  I'm not in that minority  I think eventually 
[00:43:00]  they're gonna win unfortunately  and there's a majority  of people out there  that enjoy this type of  programming  but their voice  doesn't matter  and the religious  you know the religious lunatics  and the ardent liberals  you are the same person  you are the same  zealots  the same mindset  on a different side of the spectrum  you're the same  self-obsessed  and I don't mean you personally  calling in  you're the same  I really don't  you're the same self-obsessed  self-righteous bag of jizz  whether you're running cramming religion  down people's throat  or saying it's unconstitutional  to say it at all  you're just gross 
[00:43:30]  all of you  well but you know  I can hold the same beliefs as him  but obviously I've never taken it to court  I'm not all that motivated  it was a personal decision for me  and I'm not worried about affecting your life  right  which is fine  I have no problem with your decision  it doesn't make me happy  I'll say it again  but that's you know  that's your prerogative  I'm sick of  now the majority suffering  and now we take it away from everybody  I think if you took a poll  I think well over 75-80% of the people  that have gone to school  have no problem with standing up for  what 30 seconds 
[00:44:00]  to recite the Pledge of Allegiance  so why are you taking it away from them  because of some  asshole atheists out there  I think it should be voluntary  and why are my  you know what  if I have no say on what goes on in schools  and I'll be honest  I don't care what happens with your kids  any of you  because I don't have kids  why are my tax dollars  going into the school system  I shouldn't have to pay into it  if I don't have a say on what goes on  I'm not interested  that's a whole different issue  I know that  but you know what  it's aggravating  I'm not knocking you for not standing  you don't want to stand  whatever  it is your choice  well and I'm not advocating  eliminating it for everyone 
[00:44:30]  I'm just saying  don't make people participate  you know  if they don't want to be there  let them leave  if they want to sit let them sit  and let the people who believe stand  you know what I think too  the people that don't believe  and want to argue with it  and everything like that  deal with it  take it  recite it  and just look at it  as a sacrifice  for all the good things you get out of this country  that you're constantly bitching about anyway  say you know something  I really don't like the under God thing  I really don't want to stand for the pledge  but you know something  there's so many good things  that this country gives me on a daily basis 
[00:45:00]  and there's so much strife  elsewhere in the world  and I'm so glad I live here in this country  why don't I just suck it up  bite the bullet  and stand for ten seconds  when under God comes past  instead of making such a big deal about it  it's a need to stand out and notice  making people stand who don't believe  is part of making a big deal too  why do I stand to make you more comfortable  no one's making anyone stand  I'm not saying that  we're all in agreement that whatever  if you don't want to do it  you don't have to do it 
[00:45:30]  that's fine  but now it's unconstitutional  the whole pledge now is unconstitutional  this is how predictable the mindset is  you know it's going to go higher  you're just going to keep going around  I want to ask you something  I guarantee you  just by listening  and knowing so little about her  you still might  within 30 seconds  can guess who somebody voted for  that's how predictable we all are  you know  when none of us are unique  you know  stop trying to stand out  and be the one who changes  they like to think so  unless it's important  stand there if you don't agree with it  and just like substitute your own word  there you go 
[00:46:00]  why should I have to do that  I don't know  why do you get the benefits of living here  you dummy  why don't you move over to the Middle East  where they chop your hands off  for stealing gum  yeah  god almighty  people are so aggravating  you want to drive for something  maybe that's unconstitutional  or something the country is doing  that you don't like  pick a cause like  how come I'm a 40% partner  with Uncle Sam  when I go to work every day  absolutely  fight that  I'll be right there with you  I think there are much better ways  than just extorting half of your paycheck  every week 
[00:46:30]  you know  that's something  that's a cause that could be taken up  I don't think the founding fathers  saw that coming  when they drafted the whole thing up  I don't want my money going  to paying for benefits for immigrants  I'm sorry  it's not against immigrants  I don't want my money paying for it  I work for it  I don't want that  I don't want to learn the language  drop dead  there are bigger battles  and better battles  that could be fought  than I don't want to stand for that  and it is  it's just that guy  with his 9 year old daughter going  I'm going to teach you these  these  new age values  and it's going to be great 
[00:47:00]  we're so liberal  just like John Lynn's parents  John Walker Lynn  whatever that  insane type of alternatives  I hope she  someday just brings home  an animal  that murders you  slowly  and as you're dying  is just a-raping her  yeah with a Republican button on her  and the weird thing  it's like  dude people are going to realize  the status quo is not always wrong  sometimes it's wrong  but it's not always wrong  right  right  you know the same mentality 
[00:47:30]  it's so predictable  colleges are the worst  always trying to change it  ugh  real fast before we move on  Rick what's up  hey what's up  I'm a Dominican  and uh...  two guys  Mike and Mike back home  they're talking about  all these people that come to this country  and stuff  it's usually liberal seeds  like that lady that was just on  that make it bad for us  cause I've come to this country  since I was 6 years old man  I've always stood up for the pledge  and for the  you know  everything this country stands for  you don't see me going around  complaining cause my stupid ass daughter

[00:49:00]  no you don't believe in it  they'll change that  within the next couple years  you'll see that happen  I don't want to come off as anti  I don't mind people coming to this country  man  all I ask is if someone's immigrating to the country  just immigrate legally  or emigrate legally  whatever the word is  speak English  and just obey the law  that's it  then welcome  that's all I ask  to suggest they speak English at this point  but no this guy called up a Dominican guy  speaks perfect  I'm not saying I'm against people coming here  I'm not  I'm not nuts  there was a story on TV  valedictorian of a high school  and she wanted to give her speech in 
[00:49:30]  Spanish  in Spanish  was it Spanish  or she wanted to do half in English  half in Spanish  she wanted to do it in English  and then do the whole thing again in Spanish  so the school put their foot down  and said no man  yep  no English  and now I guess it turned into a huge lawsuit  big issue  and then the stupid news channel goes  well we're going to allow her to do it right here on our station  of course  and she got to do her little speech in Spanish on the stations  because her relatives that came over here and brought her over 
[00:50:00]  don't speak English  tough ass  so they won't be able to understand  how about  learn English  bring your video camera  tape her doing it in English  and then you can sit home while you're having your little graduation party in the backyard  right  and you can translate for those wet backs  there you go  when Italians came here  they had to learn to speak English  or the Spanish people just speak English  that's all I have  I don't care  Spanish people are great  they got the hottest chicks  just speak English  you'll never say it  ugh  why wouldn't you want to?  why wouldn't you want to?

[00:51:00]  2750  oh dear  keep that as a table  thank you  they might butcher the language  but at least they're trying  to any group  any group  at least they're giving it an effort  at least they're giving it an effort  I don't want Irish people coming over  yelling around in Gaelic  I don't even know if that is English  whatever it is  I need a hug  shut up  lose a stupid accent  alright  there Derek is a word  beep beep  among us beep  there is no corresponding to me  don't tell the law  but it seems to mean something  beep  to you humans 
[00:51:30]  what what what  we are being probed  what is that word?  wow  the Opie and Anthony show  here check it out  the Opie and Anthony show  a lot of people pissed off today  a bunch of people agree with us  a bunch of people disagree  that's how it is  that's alright  a couple of instant feedbacks Anthony  Tony from Boston  hey guys  I think the important part  about this argument  is the fact that under God  was added in 1954  specifically as a religious statement 
[00:52:00]  if you read the CNN article  they go on to say that  Eisenhower wanted a recognition  that our nation  and the people of the US  are under the power  of the almighty  I think unpatriotic people  are ridiculous  and I'm not sure that  it is worth going through court  for this  but at the same time  why was it so important  to add a religious sentiment  to the pledge  let's revert to the non-theistic  version of the pledge  and we wouldn't have  these arguments  I can live with that  Tony says that  ok  Chris from Jersey 
[00:52:30]  I bet you wouldn't even  read this on the air  shut up Chris  they're trying to be manipulative  and get them to read it on the air  you dumb reverse psychology idiot  what you guys got to understand  if you listen to this radio show  we don't  we're not hoping you guys agree  with everything we say  we throw our crap out there  if it sticks  if you agree with us  great  if it makes you think  great  if you think the opposite  that's fine too  but this guy  I bet you won't even read this  on the air  no Chris  I'll read it on the air 
[00:53:00]  relax  you're so obvious  he's trying to just get you  to read it on the air  still trying to be manipulative  be good at it at least  it's going to get the ears  because you're reading it  the one thing when we do  go serious from time to time  we just hope you think  think about it  that's all  we're not trying to change  anyone's minds  no  no I am actually  and if they disagree with me  I hate them  dying of fire  that easily could have been avoided  well Chris from Jersey  the constitution is there  to save the rights of the minority  from the tyranny of the majority  right  tell Norton  that the constitution 
[00:53:30]  is what allows him  to be an obnoxious a-hole  and get paid for it  my problem with the pledge  is that it asked me  to cite a pledge  to a country  without any reason  at a young age  that is remnant  of the blind allegiance  that the Nazis had  when they tried the  what  when they tried the Nazi  their allegiance to a system  was their crime  hmm  does that make sense?  not really  when they tried the Nazi  their allegiance to a system  was their crime  is he missing a word there 
[00:54:00]  or something?  yes  when they tried a Nazi  meaning in court  when he was put on trial  his being a Nazi  by allegiance  was a crime  the crime was  yes you are a Nazi  alright  maybe some punctuation  would help that sentence  ok  you guys are talking out  both sides of your mouth  in fact  you won't even read this  on the air  because it is a legitimate argument  and everyone talks  out of both sides of their mouth  do we all have conflicting views  that 1954 statement  is a great point  like yeah I wouldn't mind  if they took the under god out 
[00:54:30]  fine  go back to the old way  fine  I have no problem with that  you know what will happen  then people will go  why do I have to pledge  this allegiance  and then alright  we got to take the word  pledge allegiance  out of it  that's what I'm saying earlier  no matter what you give them  someone will pick it apart  and say no  I don't want to say allegiance  right  I don't want to say the word united  I don't want to say this  I don't want to say that  and I agree with the dude  about the first amendment  giving me the right  and you're right man  of course it is 
[00:55:00]  and I'm not knocking the constitution  but it's like my problem  is that everybody perverts it  to fit what they want  conservatives do it too  I mean I'm tired of the gun people  talking about what they said  in what was it 1602  they didn't have submachine guns then  stupid  or drug problems  you won't get my side of that argument  nah it's fine  that one's been ripped apart  more than any other one  I agree  I agree  I think if you should be able  to have a certain type of weapon  a submachine gun  because let's be honest  the British are not showing up  hey I'm going to take a 20 minute break  because you just hit one of Anthony's hot buttons  no I'm not against being armed 
[00:55:30]  I'm not totally against being armed  no but you don't even get  where it's going to come  I love the weapons  I know  that's funny  I love them  and I think anybody that  is responsible  and is an American citizen  and hasn't been convicted  of any of these crimes  you should be able to have a gun  you should be able to have a gun  you know what it's like  to try to get a pistol  I agree  in New York  it's nearly impossible  it's crazy  it makes the cops lives a lot harder  so you know there's a lot of illegal guns  but I'm talking about people 
[00:56:00]  I'm worried about people  like a lot of people  who go freak out at their jobs  and again that's a very rare case  but they have legitimate weapons  it's not the weapons fault  but with a submachine gun  it's a bad weapon man  I'm too tired to get into the argument  I don't want to argue  I think that a handgun is one thing  you want to argue  shut up  I want to hold you in that blue shirt  it's crisp  and you look good  I feel your curly hair  we'd settle on the third amendment  and just fall in love  speaking of which  let's fire some more guns today  that I like  we need to hear some more guns today 
[00:56:30]  on the Opie and Anthony show  it's been a great week  of firing firearms  we had celebrity gunfire yesterday  when Ted Nugent called up  that was great  great  now there's a guy  who has plenty of weapons  hey let's take two of our bits  and put them together  what famous person  is listening to us now  that has a weapon  that can fire it off  celebrity gunfire  celebrity gunfire  on the Opie and Anthony show today  I'm going to use that guy's way  bet you don't have the guts  to call up and do it on the air 
[00:57:00]  that'll work  bet you don't have the guts  to fire the gun on the air  alright we need  one person that is famous  and has a firearm  that is willing to shoot it today  I bet you we'll get one  Buzz from Home Alone  does he have a gun  I'm hoping  I'm hoping  let's shoot Macaulay  if he doesn't have a gun  does he have a wading pool sized hat  you're fucking terrible  I love Kevin  Lori what's going on  hey you guys had a really sensitive spot for me there 
[00:57:30]  you're a Canadian eh  I'm a Canadian eh  oh yeah  y'all bet that I'm a Canadian  they can hear us in Toronto right now  nice  they're probably laughing at us  going on silly Americans  alright what do you got Lori  what do you got Lori  well  in our schools right now  number one  when  when all the immigrants came over  they took out the Lord's Prayer  alright  okay I'll give them a little bit of room there  alright  when I went to school they left the room  which again 
[00:58:00]  you know catering to the majority  now  it's our national anthem  really  national anthem  because God is mentioned in it  so now  we can't even  can't even use the national anthem  in our schools anymore  I just know  O Canada  that's the only  can't they just say that like 30 times  and call it a day  that's the only  that's when I walk away from the TV  and wait for the American one to come on  during the hockey game  no I don't want to hear it  hold on  I gotta tell ya  I should have brought this up when it went down  I was so embarrassed to be an American 
[00:58:30]  I was at the Islander playoff game right  and Toronto  the Islanders were playing Toronto  and Toronto was playing some  some really dirty hockey  okay  dirty come on now  you guys are a bunch of scumbags  it's old time hockey  we must have kicked your ass  did we?  Ted Domi  old time hockey  anyway  so  so  the people at the Nassau Coliseum  decide  they're gonna get back to Canada  and boo through the whole 
[00:59:00]  singing of the Canadian anthem  this is after the New York thing right?  let me tell you something  everyone on the ice  is from Canada  I was so embarrassed  because they're booing the anthem  I'm like you idiots  half the Islanders are from Canada  that is a disgrace  sorry you guys all got done  I was so embarrassed  I'm like how stupid are you people  okay we're pissed off in Toronto  we're trying to figure out how to get back at them  during this playoff series  and this is the best we can come up with  to boo their anthem  when half our team is from the country 
[00:59:30]  you're booing?  so from now on no more anthem played to upset the honest Americans  right  see that's what they'll do  and I think enough of this Canadian crap  just become the 51st state and get it over with  but again Americans you guys can carry guns  you can just shoot at us  our brothers to the north  I love Canadians  man we got your back so bad  how lucky did Canada turn out that  that stupid piece of land underneath them to the south  would turn out to be the world power  and could you please at least have somebody at the border  when they're coming in going 
[01:00:00]  what country are you from?  yeah help us out Canada  come on guys  they let nothing but do  oh sorry you forgot your bomb  alright god bless  have a safe trip to upstate New York  do they stop anyone?  and the only reason we didn't take over Canada  is because it's too cold  too big  too cold  screw it  it's right there for the taking  they're harmless  it's too cold  we're ready to give you Minnesota  we don't need it  it's too cold  I don't even know why we have Minnesota  those dumb accents  you can have them  I'm from Duluth  bye bye  no more American benefits stupid 
[01:00:30]  if Canada was as warm as Mexico  yeah  your ass would be ours  we just  you can't take Mexico over  because then  that's just another problem  how would you want it?  Jesus  right?  look at the people down there  they're lazy  they don't work  it's a great place  if you're like 11 year old prostitutes  and diarrhea  wow  wasn't that on their travel brochure?  it was I'd be there  see Mexico  that's a great selling point 
[01:01:00]  wow  you know what  I gotta talk someone out of something  Rob from the NYPD  hey  what's up fellas  how are you?  hey man  I know you wanna  I know you wanna fire your firearm  but I  you know what  it would make great radio  but you can't do it sir  but listen  I'm not famous  and I'm not a celebrity  but I will be  with the members of the NYPD  when I do fire it  and do get fired  but listen  I wanna fire it  at one of these liberal sea suckers 
[01:01:30]  alright?  how is that?  maybe you get Chris back on the phone  that  that toilet  because if she wasn't gay  you knew she was gonna be mad at her father  and banging monkeys  alright  alright Rob  I'm sorry  I'm sorry  are you really on the NYPD?  yes I am  I'm on the partway  heading into work now  for a 5 o'clock roll call  which I'll probably be late  always liberals on the road  tying up traffic  alright 
[01:02:00]  I'm fed up  you're really  you're the best  you're really helping the stereotypes  don't shoot your gun off man  you're getting in trouble  don't do that  alright Rob, thank you  you guys are the best  alright there you go  I love it  hey that's  a little taste of reality  although I will say  Chris wasn't that bad  I just you know  she was alright  she wasn't a maniac  she just was like ehh  yeah  we said from the get go  if you don't wanna do it whatever  but why take it away from everybody else  you don't wanna do it  go in the hallway  with all the other kids 
[01:02:30]  and that 1954  adding God  that guy raised a point man  it did say that  it's like why did they add God  maybe you can just take the God out  I got no problem with that  just leave it away  then they'll have a problem with another one  right  now we're going around in circles  the religious thing is  hey Chris what's up  hey what's happening  hey man  hey do you realize that  the Met game yesterday  on Channel 3  cable vision  which I pay for  was in Spanish  well do they have an English version  no  it said tune in 8 o'clock  on Channel 15  to listen to it in English  after the game was over  after the game was over  after the game was over 
[01:03:00]  put the English back on my TV please  how did that  what  why did they do this  I just want English on my TV  is that asking for too much  and I don't  I don't want to pick my language at the ATM machine  one language  English  because I'm taking out American money  maybe that's the target market that's home during the day  when it was a day game  that's why  you know what I'm going to do  wow  that's good  I'll let that sit there for a minute  ok good  later guys  alright  just put the English back on the TV 
[01:03:30]  cable vision stinks  you can't get the Yankees  or the Mets in English  what a dumb  awful cable company  you can't  enough of these monopolizing  scumbag cable companies  go to satellite  alright  I have mine  I get the Yankee games  do you really?  I got that yes  yeah on satellite I have it  I love this  yes  Thurman Munson special  it's phenomenal  you love yes  you know how many people  get off today?  I could care less  I like the Yankees  there's a lot of people out there  that have a problem with yes  well alright  maybe it's a bad network 
[01:04:00]  but all I know is that the Yankees play on it  the network that  yeah is broadcasting the Yankee games here in Manhattan  but is it  the cable vision is the problem  or is it the network  I don't know enough about it  the systems don't have yes  but whose fault is that  is that the yes?  I'm pissed off  I think cable vision wants more of their cut  you know what I mean  cable vision  if I know the argument  I don't know  if someone help me here  yeah  they're not happy with their cut  hey I had cable vision for a long time  they're holding out for a better deal  when I finally got a different cable company  I was like 
[01:04:30]  it was like when Dorothy opened the door of the cabin  and everything was in color  I was like  oh my god  I get like 800 channels  instead of  I don't even know how many  cable vision gives you  I have to switch  because I have that stupid  my building had a T1 experiment or whatever  and that's the reason I was able to get like a kind of T1 line  but of course I can't sign on the computer again today  it's awful  it's your fault  it's actually faster for me  to go to a website through snail mail  I put it in the mailbox  and I get a response  you got to print out of the web page 
[01:05:00]  so I might have to go through a cable modem or something  but I don't want to support cable  so I don't know what to do  but are you making a stand?  but I do it quietly and privately  I'm just saying  I don't like cable  so I won't contribute to it  get the cable modem you think  I'm not telling no one else you'd do it  plus now cable is slower I think  hey  wow there's a couple great calls on the national line  you guys want to talk to a conservative black republican  yes  wow  Alan T's on the phone  that guy  Stan  yeah I'm here  you want to talk about being a minority  yeah it is a minority 
[01:05:30]  but I just want to make a quick point  you know I do agree with you guys about the national anthem  I mean about the uh...  saying the pledge in the classrooms  I think it just shows respect to the country  but uh... back to what you said earlier about some guy saying niggerly  or something to that effect  he's a politician  he represents a specific group of people  so whatever he says or does is a direct reflection on his constituents  that's why they want his head  that's why they want him to resign  because he's misrepresenting all the people that he was elected to represent 
[01:06:00]  but wasn't it determined that the word wasn't racist?  yeah it wasn't meant to be racist  it was probably just a stupid choice to work  if it was a racist word he should be canned  but it wasn't  it wasn't a racial detriment  no but earlier you were defending it as if it were or weren't racist  just because he said it in this America  he probably shouldn't have used that word  for the point he was trying to make  because niggerly isn't a racist word  yeah it was a bad choice of word  no if it was a racist word  I wasn't saying he shouldn't be fired  what I was saying is the same mindset 
[01:06:30]  that goes into saying  hey man freedom of speech  are the same mindset that wanted that guy fired  when he used a word that actually wasn't racist  that's the point I make  oh well excuse me for misunderstanding you  yeah no I'm not saying  you should be able to run around yelling racist things  and keep it around  especially when you're elected official  you shouldn't just be able to run around  and say what you want to say  I agree  hey Stan how much crap do you get?  how much?  you wouldn't believe it  I mean  I get more from black people than white people  that's what I mean  of course you do  exactly what I mean  like you're  what do they call you Uncle Tom right?  yeah I mean 
[01:07:00]  I go to an HBCU  so  any type of discussion  or political discussion  in any fashion  or any form  whatever  I'm always on attack  but you know what  I stand up for what I believe in  and you know  I love being a Republican  most people  most black people are conservative  they just get all this  media propaganda  and they're just getting snowballed  by liberal America  into making them think  that they are liberals  when actually they aren't  isn't it an insult  Stan isn't it an insult  when you get these liberals 
[01:07:30]  that decide that  they know what's best  for black people  and they  they feel  that you need them  you are speaking  absolute truth  yes  these pieces of garbage  villains  oh oh oh oh oh  I can't say the P word  even though we agree with you  yeah we agree  yeah we agree  but I mean  they want to tell us  they think that  what  what they think is best for us  is what we should do  I mean this country  was founded on people  who 
[01:08:00]  who  who left Europe  and wanted to start it away  for themselves  they wanted to earn  and do what they wanted  and they wanted to do  you know  they wanted to earn their own way  and that's what most black people  in this country are trying to do  but the liberals want to keep us down  where we are  so we can be dependent upon them  and vote for them  under the guise that they're helping you  because you know something  if  black people  uh... way in this country got to the position where they were all treated  and uh... uh... working just like everyone else  the liberals wouldn't have anything to do  well see the average 
[01:08:30]  see that's another misconception from white America  the average  black person that you may meet on the street works every day  supports their family  I mean if that  oh no no I'm talking about  I'm talking about the guys that the liberals like to lay out there  yeah I mean I mean but that's such a small part of uh... uh... black America though  that that that's such a minuscule part of black America  where are you from Wyoming  like what you see on television  Montana  or the idiot you hear on radio or rap songs  you see what I'm saying 
[01:09:00]  it's good to hear this because the liberals are always arguing  that no we're compassionate  but they're really uh... paternalistic  and they most of them  this is not all of them  but most of them are racist  because by thinking you're superior  you feel you have to help somebody who's inferior  exactly  and they want to keep us in that hole that we're already in  they want to keep us there  so we can be dependent upon them  and that feeds their superiority complex  which is really what it is  man you're speaking the truth  that's the gospel right there  hey uh... going back  what does the word niggardly mean?  you're talking to me? 
[01:09:30]  yeah  I don't know the literal definition of it  uh... when I first heard you say it  I thought that you said nigger  no no no no  no no no  when I talked to the screener guy  he told me the correct one  so  no we only say that word behind your back  no niggardly was  it was like a stupid word to use  yeah it wasn't like it was cheap or chintzy or something  it was a dumb word  oh so it's a jewish word  I mean that's still just bad either way  that's one where you look at that and go  why would you say that  even though yeah technically the guy didn't do anything wrong  technically but he was stupid to use the word 
[01:10:00]  someone's writing that as a Scandinavian word  I mean if I were white  I wouldn't say anything that even resembled that word  alright  the percentage rate that you get in your ass  yeah  you're right  you're right  hey Stan you're alright man  thanks a lot  talk to you guys later  give us a call from time to time  thanks a lot  appreciate it  take care bud  bye  what are we gonna call raccoons?  ha ha  ha ha  ha ha  good eating  hi right there Laura  hey  hi  we gotta get into some debauchery sometime today 
[01:10:30]  yes  let's go Laura  I'll go debauchery on ya  hi  now go ahead Laura from Cleveland  not a problem  when are the girls gonna represent in the WOW contest from Cleveland  what happened to their little shindig where they got the girls together to show some stuff  I haven't heard  I have not heard  I was out of town for a couple days  I don't know what they're doing  last I heard they were gonna get together at a bar  alright where's Foz?  we better get him on the phone today  that's right  that's right  alright go ahead Laura what are you calling for?  well you know I would love to spew forth about the Pledge of Allegiance and the guns 
[01:11:00]  because I have a lot of opinions on those  but now I have to tell you guys about this  you said about the valedictorian wanting to give her speech in Spanish and English  yes  at the high school where I graduated from and it was quite a few years ago  but they won't award a valedictorian now because well it would make the other kids feel bad  so they gave awards for the top 10 kids in the class  not the one kid who got like a 4.0 average all through high school 
[01:11:30]  that's good let's train the next generation not to be competitive  very good  doesn't it suck?  it's typical of  it's a typical stupid liberal mentality  doomed  you know there's a lot of little leagues and soccer leagues where they don't even keep scoring anymore  oh yeah  right  they don't want a losing team  right  it would make them feel bad  well then they have no balls growing up  how about teaching kids how to deal with a loss and learn that it's acceptable to lose  as long as you play hard as corny as it sounds and you do what you can  it's acceptable to be on the losing side 
[01:12:00]  that's fine  that's right  because in everything  sometimes you win and sometimes you lose  and you gotta learn that  words to live by  oh I know that  I couldn't believe it  I'm like I got to tell O and A about this  and this seemed to be the perfect day to do it  alright Laura  is this true  alright I love you guys  my angel  is this true  right now Bill O'Reilly and Sean Hannity are stapling their legs  is that true  welcome to the Russ Limbaugh show 
[01:12:30]  excellence in the broadcasting network  I hear  hoping Anthony  doing a serious talk today  today  I think I have to change my broadcasting tactics  today  we will be having girls whip them out  whip them out for Rush  this gives me an opportunity  someone hand me the staple gun  rush your boobs out of your blouses ladies 
[01:13:00]  I went back to Ohio  here on the Rush Limbaugh program  but my city was dumb  somebody get me Tippi Tom  there was no train station  our guest today Tippi Tom  there was no  a gay man  who is homeless  so tired to disappear  on the excellence in broadcasting network  where's that awful man Rich Voss  I could waste some time with him  his jokes are older than the 
[01:13:30]  red meat stuck in my vowels  thank God I could barely hear  I don't have to listen to his stupid punchlines  from 1979  oh my God  great  yeah  well now that Voss has just entered the studio  I'm sure  we'll get to some hijinks  debauchery 
[01:14:00]  and stories about  mutual jacking  ha ha ha ha  hold on friends  well I went back to Ohio  Rush get us to the commercials will ya  we'll be back  with more of the Rush Limbaugh program  excellence in broadcasting  me in front of the golden microphone  after these words  talent  talent  on loan  from God  I'll talk to you after the break  about how 
[01:14:30]  Bill Clinton  responsible for my  small junk  we have about 20  the O.P. and Anthony Show  the O.P. and Anthony Show  the O.P. and Anthony Show  we're back with the O.P. and Anthony Show  there's a guy on the phones that wants to use the word niggardly  and I had the D in there  in a sentence Anthony  Scott would like to use the word niggardly 
[01:15:00]  in a sentence  alright  hey guys  I was at the last sticker stop  and  Earl was acting very niggardly when I asked him for an extra sticker  he said no one per fan  turn around  what's his problem man?  Earl was very stingy with the WOW stickers right?  yeah I mean I don't want to be a racist but he was acting very niggardly  well okay  that's not being racist  niggardly is not a racist word we learned that today 
[01:15:30]  you guys rule  thank you  Jack who's a little league coach  yes Jack  hey guys what's up what's going on  lucky you  yeah right  not anymore man not anymore  you got Jim Norton's dream job  yeah I was thinking about that  Jimmy if you need an assistant coach next year I'll give you a call  now listen about five years ago  you know I remember when I was a kid you used to have to actually win something  do a good job and win a trophy  now they hand them out like candy 
[01:16:00]  every kid on the team gets a trophy  at the end of the season you get your best players working hard  you got to get the same trophy as these kids walking up with their shoes untied  their hat on backwards they don't even have to hold the back  that's it  it's ridiculous  just to make the parents happy  every kid in every sport is treated like the special olympics now where all of them got a ribbon  everyone's a winner  there's no doubt  everyone's a winner  there should be winners and losers  there is  yeah you're out there to beat the other team  there's a winner and a loser at the end of the game  I mean I've done games where they say it's better off to tie 
[01:16:30]  let's just end it now so we can call it a tie  it's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard in my life  these people got to get a life  and that teaches them what?  exactly  how to compete for a job with someone and you both get it  that's realistic in the corporate world you dopes  and when you're thrown out on your ass because you weren't as good as the guy that got the job  you can then do what?  you go kill yourself  commit suicide because you never lost anything in your life  that would be good  if any of you parents out there are worth anything and your kids play baseball 
[01:17:00]  stop putting the responsibility on everybody else  they're a bunch of little faggy kids  why don't you just teach them how to win and lose gracefully  be good parents and they can win and lose with grace  that's fine  parents have to show up first Jim  it's a two hour babysitting service is what it is anyway  they drop them off, don't see them until it  it's pouring rain and they don't even show up  don't they think to come get the kid?  I played Little League  at times I was good but I by and large stunk  my self esteem was awful before I started  and it was awful when I finished  it had nothing to do with my coach 
[01:17:30]  I was awful at Little League  did you wear your boots?  during Little League like you did at the softball game?  you know I really don't appreciate that teasing  I like the kids who wear the black dress socks underneath the uniforms  that always looked sharp  I wore my little cleats  you know how bad I was at Little League?  I had to come off the bench to play right field  really?  that's bad  you must have just been a kid to even up all the numbers  that was awful  even up the numbers  baseball was not my sport growing up 
[01:18:00]  thank you Jack  you were in Little League though Jim?  you used to have a life before this  sex addiction took over his life  it's funny you should ask  in Little League I would play on the team  we were never very good at  one year we won the championship  like the bad news bears  my dad was the coach  we were very nerve wracking  remember he was so proud of me  that while the other team went out to celebrate  me and my... 
[01:18:30]  you know you can't say that  no my dad was never the coach  your dad seems very nice if he did that for you  you know what that's a great joke  why waste it by having him dump out of your punchline  that dude because that's the way...  I'd actually want that one going over  it's just silly  he'll yell that boss will yell that  well I'll tell you why because they'll hear the punchline  in Atlantic City on  I'm not plugging why  Atlantic City sold out  Voss we haven't turned your mic on yet  it's sold out 
[01:19:00]  Voss is talking and his mic hasn't been on  he has no clue  and he's arguing with me  no one hears you  and I don't appreciate you thinking  that I would plug Atlantic City dude  why would I plug Atlantic City when Westbury still has tickets available  September 7th or Red Bank going on sale Friday  you guys just missed a great thing  Voss has been a part of this break  the whole time it has no clue his mic hasn't been on yet  have you been adding things in  see he's still adding  he's still talking 
[01:19:30]  he was just adding things  and thinking that we were with him  we're not with you yet man  we'll decide when you can join the party  but to answer your question I stunk  no I'm just kidding  we'll turn your mic on in a second  Jason go ahead  hey man how you guys doing  hey uh...  I got a big problem with some of these liberals  the biggest problem I have is  that a lot of people don't see the big picture  is the fact that  with all this posturing and talk  they say about oh we want equal protection under the law  equal opportunity for everybody under the law 
[01:20:00]  then they bitch and complain when there isn't an equal outcome  but the problem is  they're trying to take away weapons from everybody  even though by itself a gun is an inanimate object  and it can't do anything  so they get away from all kinds of personal responsibility  they don't want anybody to have any competition  so now you're playing with the tent in gym class  the parachute thing where you dive underneath it  instead of playing soccer because  oh we can't have anybody lose  the retarded kids did  no we played with the big 
[01:20:30]  they brought the big parachute in so they could go  we played with the big parachute  like you're putting a sheet on the bed  and then everyone  okay get under the parachute  oooooh  what is that?  the thing is though I mean they want to play these non-competitive games  they don't want anybody to lose  they're going to turn us into a nation of big pussies  and then what's going to happen is  once they have all the weapons taken away from us  they're going to turn on the  and we're going to turn into a big communist state  that's a little apparently  conspiracy theorist  sir that's a little 
[01:21:00]  I think that's a little far to be honest  I don't think that's going to happen  well let me ask you this Norton  why in the hell is it that every time Rosie O'Donnell's on there  that fat pig always posturing about how  oh nobody can have weapons  anybody who owns a weapon should go to jail  but at the same time her bodyguards are carrying them  dude I've been doing that joke on stage  I agree with you on that, that was a bit hypocritical  I actually like Rosie because she trashed Michael Jackson the other night  and called him a pedophile on stage  so yeah just because certain people have hypocritical stances 
[01:21:30]  doesn't mean that we're going to turn into a communist state  why would we turn into a government that in the Soviet Union didn't last like what?  60, 70 years?  you know communism is not going to happen dude  it's just not that more  you have the opportunity for communism because you have equal outcome  and when everybody is equal and nobody owns everything  they're trying to chip away at property rights  where the state owns everything, the government expands  you end up with a communist state  you know something, I kind of like a guy though that still is afraid of the commies  I know!  it's nostalgic, isn't it nice? It's refreshing 
[01:22:00]  you don't hear about the commies anymore  we really don't, I mean, you know, it's like we're not going to turn to communists  maybe socialists, I don't know  the towel heads, the animals, the filthy animals over there in the Middle East  but the commies, we haven't heard that in quite a while  I think Mike can explain it a lot better  Plus he's raising his hand  yes sir, he's raising his hand  look at his little hand  can I get in?  oh my god, that's great  Fosco play in the yard  the parents are having fun now 
[01:22:30]  you have no stories  you're a midget  and liberalism, I got great snuff  you know, I know a lot about that stuff  what do you know a lot about?  first of all, he held his hand up  I thought he was holding up one of those oriental back scratcher hands  I thought he was waving that around  but no, it was his hand  hold on  hold on, Mike  Mike from Philly, go ahead Mike  yo guys, what's going on?  I have a couple things, but first, coming from Philadelphia 
[01:23:00]  oh, that's word  well, how about some equally polite language there, sir?  who are you, Jimmy Norton?  yeah, little potty mouth  well anyhow, you know, when you have this equal rights crap  you know, with fair things, with sports, and there's no winners  you get a product like the Phillies  I mean, ten years now, just anguishing lost  it's disgusting  why you hate it  and I have another thing about the show in Atlantic City for Jim Norton  there's 250 seats opening back up tonight 
[01:23:30]  and they're releasing it in about an hour and a half  what?  no, they're not  you know what she's talking about  unless that chick from the Cher concert bought them to sit in  that fat pig who got dragged out  no, AC is on that  this boss is working with me, by the way  there's a state in this country, and this is true  they want to stop musical chairs in the classroom  because it causes aggression amongst the kids  musical chairs  or at least they want the adult to put his pants back on and get out of one of the chairs 
[01:24:00]  out of that last seat  I'm serious  hey, don't laugh, we do a little game on this show called Musical Dildo  I think it's time to bring back one of our best bits of all time  musical dildo chairs  musical dildo chairs  musical dildo chairs  musical dildo chairs  oh, we gotta do this  and this time you put a nail in it  musical dildo chairs  you know what's the game you can play?  with hiv on the tip  musical dildo chairs  one has the hiv 
[01:24:30]  when can we play musical dildo chairs  jeez, with all the women that have come down for the WOW contest  exactly  I'm really annoyed that you said you know a lot about liberalism and conservatism  yeah, tanning booth boss  Teddy what?  tanning booth boss  I'm not a tanning booth, I can't get a cab  why are you so tan?  you're in a tanning booth  I'm not in a tan  first of all, shut up, no pigment  first of all, I play a lot of golf  when I was young 
[01:25:00]  golf without the L  without the L  when I was building tennis courts  the Knights of St. Andrews  called it golf  golf without the L  when I was playing tennis courts  I get real dark  when I was young I was building tennis courts  and I was real dark and I had like an afro  and these kids drove by  when we were building tennis courts  and they were yelling at me, throwing bobbles  going, hey nigger  they were screaming at me  oh my god  they were throwing bobbles at me  oh you know what 
[01:25:30]  rich boss's theme music  yeah  hey love productions presents rich boss  you've seen him on the deaf comedy jam  and with his jerry curl hair  fight the power is rich boss's new cd  laugh  ha ha ha ha ha  feeling 
[01:26:00]  stupid  hou  that's great  uh-oh breaking news from Cleveland  we gotta stop the show  Alex  of course we're doing a WoW contest Anthony  yeah  I don't think they know that in New York City  for some reason  thank god we're syndicated  were syndicated. There are people that hate the fact that you and I are syndicated. Oh, I know.  If we weren't syndicated, we wouldn't have a wow contest. The girls have let us down once again  in our hometown of New York City. We'd have no broads. We have one girl officially that has 
[01:26:30]  represented New York City in this wow contest. The other girls, they happen to come from D.C.  Yep. And we put them under the New York heading because we took their pictures here in New York  City. You ladies are letting us down once again. And we would be really pathetic if we weren't  syndicated. We'd have nothing to show our listeners. With that said, hopefully some  ladies will... Well, they're not going to show up. They're not going to show up. But there's  an update from Cleveland. Faz, what's up? Hey, guys. Hey. Well, I got kind of some bad news 
[01:27:00]  here in Cleveland. What, sweetie? We are kind of out of the wow contest for right now. What  happened? I thought you guys were going to a bar because you can't get the pictures done  at the station. And all the girls were going to come down and do their thing. And we were  supposed to see the pictures by now. Well, you guys are actually going to kind of laugh  your ass off right now because yesterday we started the wow contest. We were at one of  the crazy horses in Cleveland. And right as the wow contest was ending, I called over 
[01:27:30]  and tried to get a message to the girl that's taking the pictures for us. As soon as the manager  handed her the note to call me, the club got raided and he got drug out of the club.  Raided? Raided? It got raided for something. We don't know exactly what yet. But we don't  want to send our photographer and our people over there because we're afraid they're going  to get shot. Shot? For what shot? They came in, guns blazing, huge guns, SWAT gear, everything  from what I'm hearing. What the hell's going on in that place? 
[01:28:00]  How ugly were these chicks? Yeah, right. Yeah, they come in. It's a crime. You will not be  representing Cleveland in the wow contest. Put your goddamn clothes back on. You know,  your building manager really annoys me in that stupid building you guys are in. Oh, you're  ready to say that stupid state of yours, weren't you? No, I have no problem with Cleveland.  You already have a problem with Queens, San Francisco. I have no problem with Queens. I have no problem  with Cleveland with the exception of the disgraceful Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. And I have no problem  with Extreme Radio except for the building they're in. What's wrong with the Rock and Roll? Oh, nothing. 
[01:28:30]  I mean, Sabbath shouldn't be in. The problem is, I'm done. I've dropped it. I've dropped  it. I have nothing else to say. Foz knows I'm telling the truth. There are so many more  bands more deserving at this point. There's really not. Ozzy, God bless him, took his name  off the ballot. Good for you, Ozzy. They'll get to Sabbath eventually. Yeah, of course they  will. After all the HIV positive bands are inducted before they die. That's why they're making  a Sabbath way because Ozzy is... Why are you making fun of Queen? You have a band? I certainly  know. Is Queen in? Queen deserves to be in. I have no problem with Queen being in. I have 
[01:29:00]  no problem most of them being in. But just the fact that they won't put... I don't want  to get into it, man. You know, it's a disgrace. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, I swear to God,  I hope somebody throws a Molotov cocktail in there and burns stupid Jimmy Page's leather  pants or whatever it was he wore. Oh, good, Jim. Bring out that double guitar, a string,  a string. That's good. Well, there's even some people in Cleveland that got a problem with  the Rock Hall, man. So, Foz, what the hell are you guys going to do? You've got to represent  this wow contest. We're looking for another place to have it now. Hopefully it'll be the 
[01:29:30]  club that doesn't get rated or something like that. And if the building would just get the  sticks out of their asses, we'd be able to do it here. But I don't know what to tell you  guys. Maybe if no girls from Cleveland get to come into the contest, I'll just come down  and let you empty a stable get into me for it. Hey, can't you give out your building supervisor's  email address so people can all write? Oh, yeah. That always works well. I don't even  know if they have an email address. They're already in trouble, man. Leave the kids alone.  All right, God, that sucks. All right, Foz, sorry. And any new girls today representing? 
[01:30:00]  I haven't seen any on the site, no. None. I check every five minutes because when that  new girl pops up, I know. We're all so excited. How hot is Corey from Philly? Come on.  Yeah. Give it up for Corey. All right. All right. Let me go back. I love the glasses one, dude.  I really like it. Corey from Philadelphia. The first hot chick representing Philly.  Where's that glasses chick from? She's from Philly? Oh, yeah. She's from Philly, too.  She's hot, man. Wow, look at Corey. Corey's amazing. Holy mackerel. And she's got some dirty  girl to her. Holy Toledo. What a dish. She really is a looker. You like that? Oh, boy, do I? 
[01:30:30]  Well, you know something? I'm looking at this front shot. Oh, no. There's one going one  way, one going the other. They're obviously implants. So meaty. Oh, no. She's got to be  a dancer. The girls like that are way too hot for me. So we patiently wait for the new  girls to show up on opiananthony.com. The qualifying continues. Anthony, a lot of people think they  could vote already. No. No. We're weeks away from voting. Hi, Corey. Where are you from? 
[01:31:00]  I like the girl with the glasses better. I love that girl. She's a doll.  Kira with the glasses. Hey, doll face. Little librarian look. I guess we should give the  big plug because it is Whip Him Out Wednesday. Yes. This is our huge wow contest. Up for  grabs. $5,000 courtesy of risquevideo.com. R-I-S-Q-U-E video.com. The ladies, they just  show up at the station we broadcast on. Yeah. They take their pictures. They send them to  us. We put them up on opiananthony.com. We all get to gawk. Nice. And eventually you'll 
[01:31:30]  get to vote. But we're not voting yet. So stop asking how you vote. We'll tell you when  it's time. All right? We want to qualify more girls. We want to get about 100 girls  in this contest. We're up to, what, 40-something? Right? Yeah. Okay. Bob from Comac is saying  he's seen Voss Golf. He has all the Dorf on golf tapes. Speaking of Voss. You know what?  Speaking of Voss. What? Ah, yeah. You've got to go to foundrymusic.com, our unofficial O.P. and 
[01:32:00]  Anthony website. Yeah. There's a link on opiananthony.com. There's a picture of Voss with Earl. How do you  explain it, Ant? Voss's head is on my body. Yeah, it looks like your body. It's a midget's  body. He's got a Star of David tattoo on his arm. And he's got a mule in his hand just cut 
[01:32:30]  off at that point. Yeah, that looks like the picture came from some kind of midget porno,  which could be the funniest pornos ever. You ever see midget porno? Hysterical. The little  midget ass just going to town on some full-size chick. So it's two midgets naked, a male and  a female. Rich Voss's head is on the naked male midget, and Earl's head is on the naked  female black midget. Because she's a black chick, the black midget chick. So you've got to put  the Earl face on there. Because the rest of us, it would look silly. You know, a lot 
[01:33:00]  of our listeners really taking the contestants and really doing some great stuff with it.  This is the best one I've seen so far. That one looks really good. Voss and Earl as naked  midgets on foundrymusic.com. Or you can see me this weekend at Distress. Oh, wow. Oh, he  shut off. Wow. All right, go ahead. I'm sorry. No, no. No, you do a lot for the show. I'm  really sorry. I don't want to plug Distress. You went off. Yeah, no one heard it. He's 
[01:33:30]  so desperate, he'll fall for it a third time. Go ahead. I can tell if I'm on now. I'm not  because I can't hear myself. Oh, yeah, I am on. You are on. You're such an idiot. Dodging  me from the golf course. I'm dodging him. All right. We've got to break again, Ant, because  we've got to catch up a little bit. We're going to get into some debauchery next, I think.  Let's get some of that music going again. I like that. My theme music. Oh, you know. 
[01:34:00]  We got the, um, we got this. Oh. Is there anything you guys can't find on me? Rich Voss  in the latest issue of Penthouse? No. I'm really upset about that. He did an interview. Why?  Why? You'll explain next. You'll explain next. See, that's a radio tease. That's right. And  also the, um, spanking is a no-no. Yeah, for some reason. We all got the S beat out of us  when we were growing up, right? Turns out all right. Sure. Different things. Now they're  saying it's bad. The only bad part of spanking is explaining what that little bump in their 
[01:34:30]  stomach is. Oh, my God. Now the WOW report. Sources close to Obi and Anthony say that the  WOW sticker is your guarantee of plump, firm breasts. We found out different. Let's go to  the tape. Hey, you want to see something hot? Yeah, sure. Oh, God. That's a penis. Whip  him out Wednesday. Risky, but usually worth it. Get your WOW sticker today. The Obi and Anthony  show. And W. The Obi and Anthony show. 1027-WNEW. Boobs always bring this, uh, show to us. Oh, 
[01:35:00]  I'll break up and let's Michaelacter you call a numeric. Whip him out Wednesday. Whip him  out Wednesday. Whip him out Wednesday. Whip him out Wednesday. Whip him out Wednesday.  Whip him out Wednesday. Who's kicking, boo's? Those are real. How about that woman who said 
[01:35:30]  Those are real.  Wow, that's good.  How about that woman who took the shirt off?  Ah, yeah.  Sexy.  Sexy, sexy, cool.  You have sorry, wow.  It's your booze.  Booze, sexy booze.  Yes.  You just got wowed.  Wow.  They look amazing.  That's nice.  Bobby and Anthony.  Hey, yeah.  You're all right.  It's world-renowned.  It's Whippin' Out Wednesday.  It's Whippin' Out Wednesday.  Whippin' Out Wednesday.  Those are real. 
[01:36:00]  Here's who you are reporting.  Oh, dear.  It's Whippin' Out Wednesday.  It's Whippin' Out Wednesday.  Yeah, Whippin' Out Wednesday.  Ah.  Whippin' Out Wednesday.  Ah, wow.  Yes.  And we're back with the O.P. and Anthony show.  What a gloomy-ass day here in New York, man.  I just looked out.  It's a great day.  I just looked out the window.  I was like, is it December?  What happened?  Like, I'm used to this time.  And you look out the window and it's dark. 
[01:36:30]  It's, you know, the winter.  Summer.  At one point today, no joke, we thought anthrax was falling from the sky.  It didn't look like rain.  No.  It was a beautiful, you know, summer day.  Hot.  Not a cloud in the sky.  Next thing you know, it looked like it was either snowing.  I mean, it turned out to be rain, but it's just, I don't know, whatever.  It was the wind.  Nasty.  Huh?  It was the wind.  I looked at my apartment and they looked like snow.  Yeah.  So now, I was like, yo, what is that?  The boob sighting index, very low here in New York.  It was going to be a 10 today and it turned out to be like a tree. 
[01:37:00]  It's a tree.  Rich Voss in the studio.  Pierce, you know what?  Yes.  We'll make a bet.  I don't know what the bet will be that I break 100 tomorrow at Beth Page.  You're talking about that.  Beth Page is where the pros just played.  I mean, stop.  I'll break 100 there.  Well, he's playing the black courses.  Yeah.  Black courses there.  Listen.  Beth Page Black, you're going to break 100?  If I shot an 87 at Doral.  You're going to cheat.  No, I won't cheat.  I just played this course in New Jersey National.  That's as tough as any course.  Yeah, you're saying I don't cheat.  Are you the guy like, oh, I blew the tee shot, so let me pop another ball. 
[01:37:30]  Don't you lie about cheating?  No.  Listen to me.  I don't.  In relationships, I might, but not on golf.  I don't do it, you know, in golf.  What do you mean I might?  Huh?  But here's the deal.  No mullings.  I take no gimme's, and I'll break 100 tomorrow.  You're not breaking 100 on that course.  I'm telling you.  You're that good.  It's a nightmare.  I'm not that good.  That's good.  No.  Listen, if you can shoot.  On that course.  Listen, I don't want to sit here and talk about golf, and I should be talking about distress  factory, but here's the thing.  If you can shoot an 87 at Doral, you can break 100, I guess. 
[01:38:00]  I've never played at Beth Page, so I don't know.  You're going to a tanning booth.  I would never go to a tanning booth.  I play golf, and I take my kids to the pool.  You play golf, right?  A lot.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And that's where you're claiming the tan came from?  And I take my...  Listen.  Let me see your left hand.  Listen.  What do you mean my left hand?  Let me see both your hands.  All right.  What?  You want to see my hands?  I so got you.  Come here.  Okay.  I'll bet you.  You'll see the calluses right here.  No, no, no.  This side of your left hand.  Look at how awful his hands are.  Do you wear a glove? 
[01:38:30]  Of course I do.  Then why is your left hand tan?  Oh.  Hold on, Mr. Inspector, because I take my kids to the pool, too.  I have kids, so we go to the pool.  All right?  I don't wear a glove at the pool.  I don't know.  Most golfers are very tan, but their left hand is very white.  Why would I go to a tanning booth at my age?  By the way, I did a great job on Sally Jesse Raphael this morning.  I didn't see it.  What kind of inside joke is that?  Nothing.  Come on.  Tell me it. 
[01:39:00]  You did a great job.  That's all I'm saying, man.  No.  Maybe Rich will tell you.  Rich?  Hey, boys.  Hey.  Super, stupid Jew.  What's doing, Voss?  What's happening?  Hey.  Sally Jesse Raphael had the creme de la creme.  Midget, dwarf, like dating game-ish, kind of matched the people together.  Yeah.  And I thought I did see Voss, but the worst of the thing is one of the guys, not only  was he a midget dwarf, he was fat as a house.  A big, fat midget dwarf?  Well, that's kind of redundant.  That's almost an oxymoron.  I know.  Yeah. 
[01:39:30]  Big, fat, jumbo dwarf.  If you're going to be a midget, I'd say you better be a very in-shape midget so you get  the midget chicks.  Yeah.  You shouldn't be a fat midget.  Well, that was like at that road show at Vanderbilt when you had that band with the  little fat kiss midgets playing with you guys, remember?  Were they fat?  Yeah.  It was like little fat turd, I mean, you know, the little kings.  Was that what they were?  Hold on, man.  Yes.  Go ahead.  This is the line of the day.  Voss saying he's going to break 100 tomorrow, right?  Uh-huh.  Balloon Not Joe writes on the Instant Feedback, a Jew never breaks 100.  That's hilarious. 
[01:40:00]  Yeah, Voss, if you break 100 on the black horse, you're actually funny.  Oh.  Sorry.  Voss is a very funny man.  You've got to see him live.  Well, you've got to see him play golf.  That's funnier.  Well, you never played golf on the night.  I'm out.  All right.  Easy.  But Rich, what was the toughest challenge when you were married?  What was the toughest?  When I was married?  I don't know.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  You know what?  Before you guys start trashing this demonicle, when is stupid Big Breast here and Patrice 
[01:40:30]  and Mikirio going to bring in old tapes so we can go after those?  That's true.  We saw you apart.  Even Mikirio doesn't have to bring an old one.  He can bring in one from now and we'll trash him without that.  Incidentally, by the way, my tape is in studio.  My tape is here.  I brought it.  I did what I said I would do.  It's a matter of getting all the guys together.  That you did.  Okay.  And making sure that his audio can be played over the radio because at least yours was  TV quality.  Mine wasn't.  Michael.  Yeah.  Oh, and A.  How you doing?  Good.  Hi, Angel.  Hey, what's up, Noah?  Hey, Voss, you playing a black tomorrow?  Yeah.  What time's your tee time? 
[01:41:00]  Why?  Because I'm going to be, I'm playing it tomorrow, you tool.  What time are you playing?  About 11 o'clock.  No, I'm early.  Are you getting a caddy?  Yeah, I got a caddy already set up.  Voss, I will play you.  What's your handicap?  13.  You're 13?  That's what I just said.  Hey, listen, you know something?  Go paint a house, pal.  Listen to me, stupid.  I shot at me.  You know, you're telling us.  What's your handicap?  What's your handicap?  What's my, it's an eight.  Well, then you're better than me.  Well, for the most part, but I want to challenge you to a game, all right? 
[01:41:30]  I get on the black all the time.  I play there all the time.  I've never played there in my life.  You live in New York and you've got, what are you living in, New Jersey?  No, I live in New Jersey, stupid.  Michael, what are the chances of him breaking 100 tomorrow?  No, I'm being serious.  I mean, you're not just trying to break 100 tomorrow.  He's not breaking 100.  The greens are like 14.  You know what that is, Voss?  Yes.  The level of your personality, okay?  Okay.  Your intelligence.  You are really an angry man.  What are you doing, sir?  You know, I'm just angry at you because you're a loser.  How am I a loser?  And you used to paint houses, and that's all you do is straight.  You're right, I used to paint houses 20 years ago. 
[01:42:00]  Yeah, and when you break people's shops, all you do is talk about people painting houses,  because that's all you've got, man.  What do you do for a living, sir?  What do you always ask people what they do for a living?  Well, because you're trusting me, I should know.  I own my own company, you fool.  Oh, everybody owns their own company, okay?  How many hot dogs you sell today?  What do you do for a living, stupid?  Well, what is that?  You feel like comedy?  No, but I just got a laugh in the studio, dummy.  You really did, sir.  There's four people here that got a laugh, three out of four.  That's not bad odds.  Yeah, well, let me tell you something.  Okay, okay, angry man.  I'm not angry at all. 
[01:42:30]  You're yelling.  Have you ever seen me?  Have you ever seen me?  No, shut up, man.  You don't use no way to break 100.  You shoot 115, I guarantee you, I'll bet you.  Okay, but that's nothing to calling, yelling, screaming.  Why did you bring up painting houses?  What does that got to do with breaking 100?  I've never brought that in my life.  Are you going to let me talk?  No.  Go ahead, go ahead, talk.  You don't want me to talk?  Yes, talk.  You're going to talk over because you've got nothing to say.  Go ahead, talk, and then I'll rebuttal.  Why are you calling giving up?  Let Michael talk.  Let Michael talk.  Christ, man.  Go ahead.  Every time. 
[01:43:00]  Still talking?  No.  Talk!  Every time you break chops, you always talk about somebody's painting houses, man.  It's like a repetitive, you're like a broken record.  Do you ever get any new material?  I'll tell you what.  Why don't I loan you $1,000 to get some more in this new material, all right?  The new writers.  Can you send me a check this week?  Yeah, you probably would, all right?  Okay.  First of all, you've never even seen me do stand-up.  Let me finish, sir.  Let me finish.  Let me come back to what you just said.  You've never seen me do stand-up, okay, stupid?  So you don't even know anything about my material. 
[01:43:30]  What do you mean, and half-half the country, probably two-thirds the country's never seen  you either.  Yeah.  That's where your talent comes from.  I know.  They've never seen me on my 35 TV appearances.  You're an angry man.  No, I'm not an angry man.  It's angry at you because you're ridiculous.  Okay.  I'm not an angry man, I have to pair you into one, or you've got the same basic, or you  do so, and how you put it in houses, and blah, blah, blah.  I mean, you know, you're going to do it.  It's easy for you to trash me because you know what I do, but I don't know what you do.  You're right.  We don't know anything about you.  You could be some little...  What kind of company? 
[01:44:00]  I didn't tell them what kind of company.  Yeah.  Are you the guy that called last time when I was in here with the guy from the real  world?  Are you that guy?  No, you moron.  That was somebody else that hates your guts.  No, that's a good line.  That was a good line.  See, that was a good line.  See, I'm laughing harder at that joke than the one you called me.  Yeah.  That's okay.  That's okay.  You're ridiculous.  Okay, I'm ridiculous.  I can sit there like a man and get in your face and ridicule you as well.  Okay.  Well, you know what?  Carry my bag.  Yeah, carry your bag.  All right, bitch, carry my bag.  I'll get your time on the black, and I'll get your time on the black, and I'll 
[01:44:30]  I'll give you like three to eight strokes, and just to whip your ass.  All right, try to put a sentence together without stuttering.  Okay, listen to me.  He was saying, man.  At least I got in my teeth, pal.  So do I.  Yeah, how much did you take for him?  What did you do?  So you bought it?  Because you didn't win it off your talent.  That's a damn deal.  I know.  I have no talent.  None whatsoever.  None whatsoever.  Guys, Pete from Philly is reminding us that golf talk is bad.  I know.  But I want to know, it's only bad, though.  Michael, thank you.  Rich, the guy does know a lot about Voss. 
[01:45:00]  Any caller does.  He can find his own business.  I know he can, but I'm listening to it, so I want to know what Michael does.  I'm listening, so it's a question I want to ask.  And everybody comes back, I own my own business.  Yeah, he won't say.  Anybody owns their own business.  You can hang gutters.  What kind of business?  It's an executive search firm.  Financial software.  I place people.  You place people?  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  You're the one ant.  No, I'm not the one ant.  You moron.  Do you know about the business world at all, Voss?  No, because I've always had my own business.  I don't go to morons like you.  Voss, what do you do?  What do you do? 
[01:45:30]  What's your real job?  Come to the Stress Factory this weekend, and you'll see stupid Friday and Saturday,  8 and 10, 30, 7, 3, 2, 5, 4, 5, ha, ha.  You're equipped with your knee pad, because you're a radio whore.  You go in there, and you're...  I haven't been here in four weeks.  I haven't been here every time.  You're just talking about the clock, and you're swimming to one of your bits.  I can't believe you're arguing.  You are so...  I know.  Why am I arguing?  You know what it is?  You do a thousand great shows, and one show is bad, and that's when it bothers you.  A thousand people like you, one hates you, and this is the one that gets under your skin.  A guy like this really gets under my...  Why?  I don't know why.  Why are you getting under your skin? 
[01:46:00]  I'm not getting around, man.  You've got a really short temper.  Oh, really?  You did.  Did you get laid a lot or no?  Oh, last night it was, like, unbelievable.  You did one bad show?  No, I'm...  No, if you do one bad out of, like, 25 good ones, you'll think of the bad ones.  Now, Voss actually is really funny.  Yeah.  But I've never seen him live, so...  But that angle's boring to play on here.  Yeah, who cares about that?  Let's go with, I'm a midget and I stink.  All right, Michael, thank you.  All right.  I'm going to break a hundred.  People do mistake, though.  I'm going to jump in.  I don't know if Voss doesn't need my help. 
[01:46:30]  People do mistake joking with him and calling him a zero as him not being funny.  And as much as I don't like Voss and he's an awful Jew, he is hilarious.  A funny comic.  I say this.  I think as a human...  As a person, you're gross, you're awful in a relationship, and you have warts on your  fingers, but you are a funny man.  What did you use on the chick last night?  What line got her?  Oh, no, she comes over like once a week, and she's great because, like, I don't have  to take her out.  I don't have to...  She comes over and goes, come on, let's hurry up and do this because I got to get out of  here, right?  Oh, yeah?  It's great.  And she's hot.  And we did it.  The other night we did it, right? 
[01:47:00]  And she finished like five times.  And then when I was done, she rolls over and goes, don't touch me.  I go, perfect.  Really?  Yeah.  What are you kidding me?  Don't touch you?  What are you kidding me?  I didn't want to.  And I had a cigarette.  No cuddling?  You're not a cuddle guy?  I don't cuddle.  If you call a headlock a cuddle, I don't cuddle.  You're not a cuddling guy?  I don't hold hands.  You look like someone who likes to cuddle.  No.  Not at all.  Cuddling.  It's the worst.  You don't cuddle, Jim?  No.  And if a girl touches me when I'm watching a movie, I want to break her hand. 
[01:47:30]  Boss likes to cuddle if he's wearing a collar and he's in a confessional.  Then he wants to cuddle.  You smell like lemon drops.  Boss, do you wear those Payne Stewart pants when you go?  No.  They must look like regular pants when you wear them.  No, I got a nice blue one.  Tommy, what's going on?  What's up, guys?  Great show today.  Listen, Jerry Seinfeld's opening for Voss at the Garden is more realistic than him shooting  a hundred of Beth Bates tomorrow.  Let's get semi-realistic, Tiger Woods. 
[01:48:00]  You're not that great.  Yeah, exactly.  Maybe I'm talking that.  Maybe it's really that tough.  Boss, you better call us tomorrow after you're around because we'll be on the air.  And don't lie to us.  No lying.  Don't take Gibby.  I don't do that.  I don't do that because you only cheat on your son.  Who are you playing with?  I'm playing with Paul, the manager from Caroline's.  All right.  His son, Ken.  I mean, Kenny, the manager.  Good.  I want backup confirmation from one of them.  Kenny and Paul.  Here's a question.  What does it mean?  I don't know.  Gov, like that dude who called and said he was an eight handicap and you were a 13.  What does that mean? 
[01:48:30]  And I really don't know.  Average is like eight over.  Eight over to par.  If the par is 72, if he's an eight, he usually shoots an 80.  Okay.  So if the par is 72, you think you're going to shoot an 85, basically.  72 was 13.  Well, no.  At 13 handicap, not on that course.  To break 100, they say, if you break 100, whatever.  I don't know what I mean.  Dude, I'm trying to follow the handicap.  That's the basics.  If you're like a 10 handicap, you normally shoot about 10 strokes over.  No, no.  My question.  If you have a handicap, when you break 100, would say 112 with a 13 handicap average out to 99? 
[01:49:00]  I'm serious.  Okay, handicap is going to do it.  Oh, my God, no.  I don't know.  I don't follow golf.  I'm giving it one opportunity to understand what these two zilches of an argument.  You're not going to break 100 on Bet Page.  Who cares?  Bet Page sucks.  And I like Tiger Woods because he's banging a white model.  That's all I like about him.  Golf is awful.  The guy, when I was at the open, this one guy, Azinger, walks off.  And you can hear him coming off the gate cursing the course.  He's going, F this place.  This F in place.  I played it with you.  I played it once years ago. 
[01:49:30]  That'll be you.  It's not fun.  You play Bet Page Black so then you can brag to everybody that you played the stupid thing.  It stinks.  Why was Azinger mad?  You know what Voss is going to be like tomorrow?  Well, Cramden, I need a golf partner for this weekend.  I'm having a, having a, having a.  I golf.  And you're going to be practicing in the house.  I'm hitting them uphill, downhill.  Hey.  Yo, what's up? 
[01:50:00]  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hey.  How's it going?  Listen, Voss, when you talk about breaking 100 tomorrow, you're talking about CDs you've sold?  Oh, wow.  Oh, wow.  See, now that's a great line.  That's good.  That's a great line.  Voss, you do not have a caddy for tomorrow, right?  Yeah, I got a caddy.  I don't know who it's going to be, but I called up and said I wanted a caddy.  You should get one.  You're a celebrity.  I know.  Hold on.  Matt?  Yeah.  How's it going, guys?  Matt wants to be your caddy tomorrow.  What's up, bitch?  How you doing?  Do you caddy there, Matt?  To make sure you don't cheat. 
[01:50:30]  Do you caddy there?  No, I don't caddy.  I've caddied before, but I don't caddy there.  All right.  You can caddy for me.  All right.  I mean, I, like, I, you know, call the course and they, you reserve one, but.  You're driving to Long Island tomorrow morning?  No, I'm driving tonight.  All right.  That'd be cool if one of our listeners was the guy.  I know.  Dude, why are you driving there tonight?  I live in Farmingdale, so I'm right there.  Don't count that.  We're the rules, you know.  Off the air, leave your number with them, and then I'll call you and we'll set it up.  I'll call Matt.  Hopefully this will work out. 
[01:51:00]  Excellent.  If it works out, we want a full report tomorrow.  And I'll even pay, I'll pay you what I was going to pay the other guy.  How do you think you have to pay me?  I'll put the quarter in his hand.  You tell Ty Webb I'm gunning for him.  If he's half as good as he says he is, he's going to have to play me to prove it.  Oh, I got a big mouth.  You know what, dude?  You're a good caddy.  That's something to be very proud of.  You know what golf clubs are good for?  If your six-year-old spills bubbles.  Cracker up to the head.  Andrew, what's going on? 
[01:51:30]  Or if you're Michael Skakel.  You've just spanked it in a tree.  Oh, I keep using that one.  Skakel joke in golf clubs.  Always funny.  You're right.  Yes, sir?  Go ahead, Andrew.  How can you play golf?  You can't even see over the tin cup.  I know the struggle.  Do you play D out?  What's that?  You know how you ever play D out?  Take your D out.  No.  Are you kidding me?  If you don't hit it past the ladies' tee, you've got to play the rest of the hole with  your D out.  Oh, not my little pathetic thing.  And then what happens if you don't get it past the other thing? 
[01:52:00]  It's mouth on?  What kind of faggot golfers that you're playing?  I've never played it.  I just hear about it.  D out.  D out.  Boy, those white guys are kooky on the golf course.  Like a rock concert it is.  All our Ds were out and there was a cracker in the middle and we all finished at the same  time and shared it.  Golf sucks.  Frank from Manhattan, the only way Vos could shoot 100 at Bethpage would be with a machine  gun.  I know.  You know what?  All I did was say this.  I didn't mean to make a big discussion out of it.  Now we're going to have to see because you're shooting your mouth off. 
[01:52:30]  And I don't think you're going to be able to do it.  I don't either.  All right.  We'll see.  I hope you do just to shut everyone up.  I know.  I'd shut you guys out with a softball and I'll do it with golf now.  He really did with softball.  He did.  Angel Eyes played well.  He was...  I forgot about that.  Almost MVP.  Yes.  Almost MVP.  Anthony, what do you want to do with the penthouse interview with Vos?  I don't know.  I'd like you to thank Opie and Anthony and all that stuff.  I did.  You know what?  You creep. 
[01:53:00]  Did you see that late Friday's where they said Rich Vos from the...  He's a regular guest on Opie and Anthony.  Late Friday's.  Yeah, that got nothing.  Where was that film?  In L.A.  It's national.  Stand-up guys trading punchlines with comedy's best is the headline.  You want me to be penthouse and you be Rich Vos?  You can't put the Vos voice on the whole time.  We should just have Vos do it like he does it in his act.  All right.  Give him a...  We got the guy.  Come on.  Now you're going to have to ask me to read.  Go ahead, read. 
[01:53:30]  Grab one of those.  I don't have my reading glasses.  You don't have your reading education.  It's very rare you have the guy that did the interview, so we might as well have him read it.  Why are you holding the piece of paper like you're an eight-year-old lady?  Did you see that?  He's like...  He's holding it way out, way out away from his face, squinting.  My birthday's this week.  I'm going to be an old guy.  How old are you going to be?  I can't say that because it will ruin me with the 21-year-old chicks if I say how old I am. 
[01:54:00]  All right.  Hey, Vos, a hundred bucks, you missed that putt.  Are you going to be playing for the ladies' tees?  No.  Play the white tees.  The superior race tees.  A hundred bucks, you slice into the woods.  There's no gambling here at Bushwood, and I never slice.  Can I just have a calm day in here?  Just sit around and...  None of the hell, I know. 
[01:54:30]  Don't you guys have to take a break real quick?  Yeah, I'm thinking maybe we won't do the penthouse thing.  Vos is going to pop out of a hole as I'm All Right is playing and dance around.  That was awful, that little gopher.  It kind of ruined the movie a little bit.  Yeah.  It's so cute it's dancing.  Nothing ruined that movie.  No, the gopher didn't ruin the movie.  It was still a great movie, but I didn't like the gopher dance.  Yeah, exactly.  Look at Ben doing a perfect gopher dancing impression. 
[01:55:00]  He's doing...  Because the gopher was all so herky-jerky.  All right, we're going to go to the F.U. line.  All right.  We're going to regroup.  I saw a movie last night.  I'd love to talk about it.  Oh, my God.  Let's talk about that, Andy.  Let's talk about a little bit of movies.  Yeah, this Vos thing is...  Yeah, it's just Vos.  Yeah, it stinks.  It stinks.  There's some funny lines in there.  It's not happening in print.  It's certainly not going to happen live.  Oh, God.  Damn.  How old are you?  18.  Oh, you're showing up. 
[01:55:30]  Wow.  Fabulous.  Well.  Holy ravioli.  Opie and Anthony.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  1027.  WNEW.  Uncle Crazy Yo.  Another band that is better than Black Sabbath.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  Metallica.  Uncle Crazy Yo.  What?  They're a great band, Metallica.  They're not better than Sabbath, but they're a great band.  Yeah.  It's Whip'em Out Wednesday, Anthony. 
[01:56:00]  Yeah.  We don't focus a lot of time on the Wow thing during our show because we have other things  to get to.  Just let it happen.  And we've also learned from our listeners that it gets boring after a while when we have  girl after girl talking about Wow and what's going on out there.  We just, at this point, know it happens.  Wow rules.  Wow stories suck.  Just enjoy them.  It's kind of a how-to-be-there kind of thing, you know? 
[01:56:30]  You see it, all of a sudden you're driving and a girl, you have a Wow in your car and  a girl whips out her cans.  You're thrilled.  It's great.  It's kind of cool.  It makes the commute easier.  But then to convey it is kind of like, yeah, okay.  We get a lot of boring stories because the guys don't know how to articulate their happiness  right.  But if you don't have a Wow bumper sticker, make a homemade Wow sign, put it on your car  and see what happens, okay?  I will give Rachel just a little time here.  Go ahead, Rachel.  Hi.  I live outside of Philadelphia and nobody has Wow stickers and then when you Wow them, they 
[01:57:00]  don't pay attention to you.  Well, first of all, we've told all you ladies, you only Wow the cars that have Wow on them.  Yeah, but I do.  And you know what?  Again, if you don't see any Wow stickers, then all those guys are S out of luck.  Yep.  Do not Wow a car that doesn't have Wow on them.  I know, but I was just driving just a little while ago and I saw a Wow sticker and I'm  beeping at him so I can Wow him and he didn't pay attention to me.  Wow, you must be ugly.  I am not. 
[01:57:30]  I'm actually very cute and I'm very disappointed with you.  And he must be a fag.  Maybe he's a fag.  So why would he have a sticker?  I'll tell you why.  If you can't get their attention, you take a picture of the Wow and you mail it to Tinkle  Drinker at AOL.com.  He's always trying to.  You have enough women.  Relax.  I have none.  Thank you, Rachel.  You're welcome.  And a fist and a tranny.  Guys, if you've got the Wow on your car, you might want to look around a little bit.  The girls are out there and they are doing it for you.  Pay attention. 
[01:58:00]  Some guy named Frenchie wants in on the program today.  Frenchie.  Hey, what's up, guys?  What's up, Frenchie?  Not much.  I just want to see Voss is there still.  Yes, stupid.  I'm here.  Are you doing Voss?  What are you going to do what we haven't heard before?  Hey, listen.  What are you going to do originally this time?  You skinny, Samaritan-looking white guy.  Because you don't know how to play golf.  I don't know how to play golf.  You know that?  Because you suck ass just like you did 10 years ago.  Shut up, skinny.  Let me tell you something.  You stunk in softball. 
[01:58:30]  You stunk at cooking.  Shut up, you Jew ass.  Come on.  Come up with something we haven't heard.  How much you paid for you did 10 years ago?  I just like to know.  Ask your mom.  She helped finance her.  You know why?  Why?  Well.  You stink.  In your miserable career, you have to work at 610 years to pay them all.  You are the next lady die now.  Shut up.  Shut up.  You're on your way out, stupid.  Maybe 20 years you had to bet.  You're on your way out, pal.  You miserable career.  You dump in Staten Island.  You're in the U.S.  I started in Staten Island?  You prick. 
[01:59:00]  I prick?  Yeah, you're a prick.  That's right.  Please, you are bringing this to a real squeezy home for you.  French, you have nothing today.  Frenchie, you are.  Frenchie, not one of your best performance.  I'm telling you, you can't come up.  Oh, boy, Frenchie.  You know why I stink?  You're like a souffle that's not coming out.  You stink.  Don't forget, with your T-Rex arm, how can you pull off?  Go cook something, homo.  You know what?  Of course, with your T-Rex arm.  We need at least 10 feet long, you know what I mean. 
[01:59:30]  That is weak.  Oh, no.  You don't know how to play golf, you dumbass.  Shut up, Screech.  Mark the day.  June 25th.  June 26th.  This is your last performance.  What day is today?  25th, right?  26th.  26th, your perfect angle.  Oh, it's the same.  Goddamn phone.  Mark it.  Yeah, it's the phone.  Yeah, they didn't know.  It's the phone.  All right, Frenchie.  All right, take it easy, guys.  Love you.  I know he was a little too brave today.  I know.  I'll tell you, you can't take on Vasa with that thing. 
[02:00:00]  You need the, with the showtimes, you need that thing that you hit the ball with.  Club, stupid Jew.  You, you are, your teeth need to pay for them.  You have to work 20 years with your stupid act.  You, Jew.  I'm dying over here.  I am sweating into my parfait. 
[02:00:30]  June 26th, 2002.  Frenchie jumps the short.  June.  You're not dying, Frenchie.  You're killing everyone around you.  You should have went with his Martha Stewart material.  I know.  That sea cannot cook.  He previewed his Martha Stewart material.  And you know what he did?  It was good.  Yeah.  He had a whole break to think about that.  I know.  Hey, there's a real hot chick here for the WOW Contest.  Anthony representing New York.  Thank God.  Finally.  One of the New York girls. 
[02:01:00]  Where is she?  Checking in.  Is she out there?  Have her, uh, poke her head in a minute there.  What the hell?  Junior.  Without Rick.  How are these pictures going to turn out?  Stinky's going to be taking the photographs.  Oh, no.  But Rick is like the master.  Hi.  Please remove your clothing for your photo shoot.  Hi.  I thought that was her.  Okay.  Please now pose sexy.  Pose sexy-like. 
[02:01:30]  Hi.  I'm Garrett, your photographer.  Get sticky in here.  Okay.  Stand against the wall nude.  Like a before shot in some bizarre medical journal.  Yes.  Do you ever get your hands on those as a kid?  And no matter, she could have the worst disease, but as long as she was naked standing there,  it was kind of like, yeah, okay.  No, I don't care about the tumors over her knees.  I'm going to go the other way on this.  Why?  You get your hands on that and you're like, wait, I thought naked chicks were supposed to be hot. 
[02:02:00]  I didn't care.  Really?  I didn't care as long as they were naked.  They'd do that front shot and then the side shot and they'd have the black strip over their eyes  so you couldn't tell who they were in the medical books.  I love the...  Because they had to check for that curvature of the spine thing.  Right.  Yeah, yeah.  She has scoliosis.  Scoliosis.  I love the balloon knot with the warts on them.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  The balloon knot close-ups with the warts.  I would thumb through those books and go, all right, that's acceptable spanking material.  Hey, where's Stinky Gary?  Hi. 
[02:02:30]  You're looking for him and the girl.  I'm getting the proper lens for the camera.  Get the mic, Ben.  I'm calling you out on something today.  Hi.  Why are you handing me a note that says, real hot girl here for a while?  And then you're laughing as you're handing me the note.  How awful is she?  I haven't seen her.  Don't ruin it.  Hold on.  Don't ruin it.  Look, Opie.  Opie.  I don't care what you say after the photos are taken.  But let me tell you something.  Let me convey a little story about me walking to my car this morning.  I'm walking to my car.  What happened? 
[02:03:00]  Well, I'm walking to my car out of my apartment.  The truck pulls over and some guy leans out and goes, you are effing up the contest.  And I go, what?  He goes, you're scaring all the girls away.  You talk about what pigs they are.  And I said, well, that gets the hot girls to go.  He goes, no, don't you understand female thinking?  Here I am.  I'm on my sidewalk with your little briefcase.  You know me, I just make up my briefcase.  I got a Dwayne Reed bag and my cell phone.  And I'm walking.  I'm all tired.  With your Scooby-Doo lunchbox.  Scooby-Doo lunchbox. 
[02:03:30]  Yes, sir.  I'm listening to you.  Yes.  And he goes, you don't understand how women think.  Even the hot ones always think they got something wrong with them.  He's right.  So if even the hottest chick is thinking maybe we're going to pick apart the ass that she thinks is too big  or the cans she thinks are uneven or something, it's going to scare every girl away.  And, gentlemen, if you're listening today, I completely agree with you, even though you made me late.  But, you know, you've got to wait until after the photo shoot.  Hi, Stinky Garrett.  Good luck explaining this beast after the photo shoot. 
[02:04:00]  Stop it.  I haven't seen her.  I haven't either.  What are we looking at, Garrett?  Are you bringing her in?  Is the sound on outside?  Where is she here, Evan?  Where is she?  What's up, Stinky?  What's wrong?  Steve Seeker says crackle much.  Steve Seeker says crackle much.  Why the smirk?  Oh, man.  Why the smirk?  Hi.  I'm your photographer.  She's horrendous.  Please remove your clothing.  Please put it back on. 
[02:04:30]  Who has the balls in this room?  Please post-text.  Because I'm sick of having the balls.  And Ann has the balls as well.  What does she look like?  Bring her, Ann.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Make sure she doesn't go in the bathroom.  There's no problem in the bathroom because someone has to turn down the monitor right now, please.  No, no, no, no, no.  Turn down all monitors, Stinky, right now.  Okay.  Good deal.  Do it, you hot seat young fella.  Hi.  All right, listen.  Listen.  They can't hear?  Wait.  All right, listen.  And I'm not calling Ann out on this at all. 
[02:05:00]  Is it still on out there?  Hold on.  All right, I am sick of having the balls on this radio show.  Anthony has balls as well.  I'm not calling him out on this one.  Who in this room has the balls to tell her that she is not worthy for this concert?  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Of course, Voss does.  I always do.  I always try.  Jim Norton?  No, Voss, he'll do it.  No, I don't.  Ben?  I can't be into it.  I can't be into it.  I can't be into it.  So let me.  Steve?  They want to do it.  I mean, I have no problem. 
[02:05:30]  I don't know what she looks like.  I have never seen a four.  Look, here's the deal, though.  I don't want her to come in and then Voss all of a sudden attacks.  I want to talk to her a little, get to know her background, get a good look, really soak  in the look before, you know, and maybe that'll give Voss a little more ammo.  There's no one better than Voss at this.  See, I haven't seen her.  I haven't seen her yet.  Well, I mean, I don't want to, like, make her cry or anything.  No, no, shut up.  You don't have a conscience, you awful man.  You know what, though?  Let's see what she looks like.  How many nights have you been curled up in the fetal position crying because you're lonely 
[02:06:00]  and angry?  Last night.  Let me explain something about this radio show.  Like, when I do this stuff, it's not that fun because people expect it from me.  Yeah.  I think people are expecting it from someone like Voss.  I want someone that doesn't have the balls normally to do this, Jim Norton.  That's not true at all.  You're absolutely wrong.  I don't, I won't do it just for the sake of doing it.  There's no sake of doing it.  No, no, no, no.  It's something I don't, God.  This is something that needs to be done.  Dude, I say horrible things to people.  It's just something I don't like to do because I'm not comfortable with it.  I'm honest about that. 
[02:06:30]  I'm not being a dick.  But Voss is going to have no problem with it.  I've done it a million times to these girls.  And I'm not being a pussy, either.  I've said awful things to people.  But if someone being naked...  Thinking if he's pushed, has the balls to do it.  Yes, he does.  Ben, if he's drunk enough during the show, will do it.  And do it.  Ben will call her at four in the morning and do it.  I call one of the hottest chicks that was ever in here.  I told her I don't like you.  The Bacardi girls that time.  I told her I do not like you.  I told her off the air I didn't like you.  Norton doesn't want to say anything because there's always a chance you might bang her.  Nah, but I can't just be mean to somebody naked. 
[02:07:00]  I've got a weird thing with that.  I'm not saying it's wrong.  I just can't do it.  Bring her in and play it by ear.  Steve, any redeeming value?  None.  Bring her in and we'll play it by tusk.  None.  She's wearing her underwear, man.  She's got like Mickey Mouse, dirty boxers on.  Let's just put it this way.  This girl will make the girl from Columbus look like a supermodel.  Let me look at Columbus.  Bring her in, man.  She came down for the con.  Irene.  Yeah?  What's wrong with you?  What's wrong with me is that I want to know something.  Hi, Irene.  How come you're politically incorrect with some people, which is okay, but some other people, 
[02:07:30]  you're scared and you step on people, you act like you're on eggshells.  What do you mean?  Like?  Put them in.  Please explain.  Why is that?  Please explain.  Well, for instance, certain ethnic groups, you don't give a damn how you degrade them.  Be blunt.  Be blunt.  And say what you mean.  What ethnic groups?  Be very plain and clear here.  The black people, you seem to get very frightened of offending them.  They kill people.  I'm not afraid of offending black people.  Yes, you are. 
[02:08:00]  You're absolutely wrong.  No?  We aren't afraid of it.  Okay, and why are you specializing in some soft-torn crap?  I mean, what are you doing?  You're catering to the jerks of this country and that's how you make your salary?  What are you talking about?  Yes.  What is wrong with you?  What are you talking about?  People don't act like you.  They're not on the street.  Why don't you get to the point of what you're saying?  People sell drugs on the street.  I'm saying, how come you're specializing in this soft-torn crap?  That's soft-torn.  How fat are you, Cher concertgoer?  How fat are you?  What am I fat I am? 
[02:08:30]  Yes.  A 125 pound.  Really?  Then you must have a long red hair.  Oh, good.  Irene.  It's not hot red either.  Beautiful, big, green eyes.  Irene.  Who the hell cares?  What I'm saying is that you specialize in soft-torn.  You specialize in the low elements of people.  Irene, can I ask you something?  And you love it.  Irene.  You're 35 to 40 years old.  God, I've got to ask Irene something, but you won't listen.  Irene.  Irene.  How did you get to know this show?  I listen to it sometimes. 
[02:09:00]  Why?  Because sometimes.  Why?  You know why?  Why?  Sometimes you're funny.  All right.  Then you lose it.  You lose it.  You don't appreciate the girls that come in and what you call the soft-torn.  Well, that's part of us and part of our show.  And there are two women who are mentally deranged who obviously don't have any self-esteem.  Three now.  And you just degrade them to hell.  Oh, we rip them apart.  What the hell is wrong with them?  You are a sad, sad woman.  We rip them apart.  You are the saddest woman.  No, I'm not a sad woman.  I'm a sad one. 
[02:09:30]  You're sad.  No, you're not.  Yes, I am.  You're obsessed with this show, and it pisses you off, and you love being pissed.  So you keep coming back.  And I think that sometimes you're funny.  I love to laugh.  And I think that sometimes you're intelligent, but you really go out of your way to degrade people.  Who's your thing?  And you don't...  All right.  You don't...  What nationality are you?  What nationality are you?  What nationality are you?  What nationality am I?  I don't think it's...  Why not?  You're talking about nationality, you stupid dishonest coward. 
[02:10:00]  Speak the truth.  Call us the truth.  What nationality are you?  You degrade...  Shut your lying face, dummy.  What are you, a racist?  I'm very nervous that you don't offend certain groups.  You're absolutely wrong.  If you're going to be politically incorrect, be politically incorrect.  What are you not?  You are an insane...  You're a dishonest.  You're probably a real racist, and we're joking.  What ethnic group are you?  That's right, you white trash whore.  That's right, whatever you are.  Use your dirty language, you filthy-mouthed, poorly-raised hooker.  I used to work there. 
[02:10:30]  I used to work there.  What are you sucking, sucking, you don't work for money?  Don't tell me.  Don't tell me anything.  I'm 50 years old.  Exactly, you aging meatbag with one pest.  You act like 12.  50 years old.  And I don't know, you don't work?  We like acting 12.  And we like young women.  Did she say she used to work?  Young women with firm, firm breath.  Boom.  Did she say she used to work here?  Teenagers are a bunch of suck-ass jerks.  That's right.  You filthy-mouthed, senior citizen. 
[02:11:00]  Thank him for that.  That's a nice language for a grandmother, you old bag of meat.  Nice language for an old lady.  Irene, you used to work here?  She hung up.  She hung up.  Typical of a hole like that.  Hang up.  I don't think she was white.  She didn't sound white.  Whatever she was, why don't you offend black people?  What are you talking?  Shut up, stupid.  I hate old, deluded people.  You 50-year-old, one-breasted bag of meat.  Just hang it up and be grateful that some of your friends are still living. 
[02:11:30]  If that exchange isn't worthy of a Jim Norton promo, I don't know what is.  I saw Steve going, yeah.  I hate people that don't tell the truth.  Be honest about where you're coming from.  I thought she was endearing.  She was an old pig.  I don't like Jim Norton.  I don't think he's funny.  I don't like Opie and Anthony.  All right, you accept that because it's an honest point of view.  But when you're coming from like this,  I hate the fact that my youth is gone and I listen sometimes.  Like Anthony pointed out, I like to be mad.  Just be honest that you like to be angry so that's why you listen.  I hate liars. 
[02:12:00]  She enjoys listening to get angry.  Dude, people don't think the show is funny.  I accept that.  That's a taste, judgment call, fine.  But just stop being so...  And then she's going, you effing...  Exactly.  Show your true colors, you uneducated, ancient pig.  You cryptic, filthy-mouthed old grandmother with no love left in your one-breasted life.  I'm 125 pounds.  And she doesn't have hot red hair.  It's probably orange with green eyes.  Boy, that's really sexy.  You glow-in-the-dark bag of pig meat. 
[02:12:30]  Bright green eyes and red hair.  Do you have any primary colors?  That bozo hair.  That bozo color.  Yeah.  Big, big, big red, awful orange hair.  That's really sexy.  I want to put my mule into a sun-kissed with two little emeralds staring out of it.  Just big, beautiful green eyes.  Men never care about your eyes.  We don't care, ladies.  We just don't care about your eyes.  I like eyes.  I love eyes.  I don't care about them.  You don't look at the person as a human, man. 
[02:13:00]  No, I like a human.  You look at them as an object.  I think...  I swear to you, the eyes are the best face on a woman.  No one likes the eyes just sealing them shut with his seed.  Yeah, they're not the best thing on a woman.  You're sick if you don't look at eyes.  Dude, I look at them when I have to, when I'm apologizing the next morning, but I don't  like to stare at them.  Because usually they're crying.  Maybe that's it.  Do you understand what I mean about that person?  Absolutely.  That's what makes me so angry.  So just be honest about why you don't like somebody.  Don't try to be clever and pseudo-manipulative. 
[02:13:30]  Just tell the truth.  What you don't like, get to the point.  Okay.  We have a girl outside.  Oh, thank God.  And you like soft core poor.  Believe me, if we can get away with hardcore, that's what we'd be doing.  She brought photos as well.  Oh.  You pig.  Yeah?  What, Stinky?  What?  Let's see some of the photos first.  What?  Spread eagle photos.  Stinky, gather up the photos and bring them in.  Let's see the soft core.  Let's look at the photos first.  I used to work on Fifth Avenue.  Here's your money, Daddy. 
[02:14:00]  That's what you did, you ancient pig.  Youth is gone.  Get used to it.  You dirtbag hypocrite.  But we're all going to be old someday.  I'm not knocking that, dude.  I'm 33.  Do I resent people who are 18?  Most of them are dumb, but, I mean, no, I don't resent them.  Good for them.  Where are the pictures?  Kids today.  They're not leaving her hand.  If they come in, she comes in.  Tell her to come in with them.  No, no, we've got to take a break.  Hey, guy.  We've got a break.  Oh, she doesn't want them to be posted somewhere.  All right.  Okay.  Sorry, I guess. 
[02:14:30]  Does everybody calm?  We've still got to talk about Anthony's little movie thing.  Oh, it was an awful movie last night.  And this fat chick that was at the Cher concert, wrecking everyone's time at the FUC Center there.  Another fat monster causing a scene.  Why can't, I mean this, why can't that time?  There's nice fat people out there, Jim.  There's plenty of nice fat people, dude.  Of course there are.  Why can't at times?  You generalize too much.  I know, I know.  I'm a bad man.  You hate all of San Francisco because it's one atheist.  I don't hate all of San Francisco at all.  There's a mindset that it seems to permeate San Francisco. 
[02:15:00]  No, I don't hate it.  It's a good city.  You have a great vocabulary.  Dude, I really don't, but you're just a complete retard.  Yeah, Voss does those commercials.  Voss thinks that permeate means forever.  Voss does those commercials about reading for us.  He has no cat feet.  He has no new ears.  He has no new material. 
[02:15:30]  My daughter owes.  I owe my daughter money, and I suck because I messed that up.  That's all right, Ant.  Oh, Angel, thank you.  You're wearing a very pressed shirt.  I know.  Got a little starch in your shorts today, huh?  Got a little starch in your shorts.  Sometimes I say that if someone's cranky.  A little starch in the shorts.  We all crack up.  Maybe that's the type of humor that that old bag of meat likes.  The type of, you know, oh, we all laughed a little, and then that was the end of that.  You know, no one got hurt.  It's that soft core stuff. 
[02:16:00]  I just hate that.  Just a jealous old lady.  Really, really absent to rage.  We didn't get on the blacks enough for some reason.  That really annoyed me.  What do you want us to say about black people?  We goof on everybody, but you don't want to be vicious.  You want blacklisters and whitelisters, and that's not being politically correct, stupid.  I just want to bang women of all races, so I don't want to alienate anybody.  Creepy old racist whore.  Oh, yeah?  I haven't seen...  Now, see, do I walk out?  She's a mess.  Do I walk out and look during break? 
[02:16:30]  I kind of wanted her to come in.  She's trying to sneak out.  Get the zookeeper to keep her in.  Did we check her for weapons?  Where's she going?  She's got that look.  Where's she going?  All she has to do is bleed on us.  Let them hang like the animals they are.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony show. 
[02:17:00]  Irene's calling back.  Irene?  Yeah.  What's wrong now?  No, I just want to tell you that I'm no old hag.  You passed me on the street, you wouldn't recognize me.  I got a call.  Number one, tell that guy that I'm no old hag.  And what if I was?  So what?  Would that make me less of a person?  Yes.  No, it would not.  It would not. 
[02:17:30]  You see, you're so mainstream.  You're trying to be so cool, but you're mainstream America.  Yeah.  So what the hell are you talking about?  You don't think there's any old, good-looking, sexy people?  You sound like the chick from Midnight Cowboy.  You were going to ask me for money?  I'm so shy away from that.  You don't have no idea.  I'm a sexy chick.  Can an old lady yell like this?  She wouldn't have the energy.  It's not the fact that you might be...  Yes, I used to work there.  It's not your age that I care about.  It's your thinking.  It's your mentality.  I don't care how...  No, my mentality is...  If you let me finish your sentence, I let you finish, you let me finish.  That was what bothered me. 
[02:18:00]  It wasn't the fact that you might be 50.  I don't care.  I don't have sex with a 50-year-old woman like yourself.  I mean, I'd probably feed you maybe some...  Pull your diapers off and enjoy you.  I'm not saying that your age doesn't bother me.  That's correct.  No.  I'll tell you what bothers me.  You degrade people at this station.  I don't like to feel porn.  And I want to know what kind of teenager you have to cater to to get ratings.  Why can't you be intelligent?  Irene.  There's not funny people that you are.  You let it out with the crap.  You want to degrade black people. 
[02:18:30]  Irene.  Irene, if I could...  Because they loved it.  That's right.  You're right.  If you want to bring up...  Why do they love it?  Why do you have to feed into it?  If you want to bring up ratings, we do very well in the ratings with people that are a  lot older than their teens, Irene.  That's probably their parents.  Well, whatever.  The point is, is that why can't you be funny and intelligent without being disgusting and  degrading?  So you know what's funny and entertaining to everybody else. 
[02:19:00]  People are stupid.  Young people are stupid.  See, you arrogant old bitch.  You know what you've been talking about.  She is so jealous of you.  She's jealous of youth.  Young people.  Young people.  You jealous, old, angry elitist.  I am not old.  I used to be a young person just ten years ago.  When I was younger, I didn't do this.  You are an ass, Irene.  You are an ass.  My ass.  You are an ass.  This comes out of my ass.  Hey, stop.  You're being disgusting now.  Stop trying to be clever.  What kind of dignified senior citizen?  There she goes again. 
[02:19:30]  See?  How easy you are.  With your dirty mouth.  With your potty mouth.  For me to come to 888 7th Avenue, my old digs.  I used to work there.  What did you do?  You're so easy to make man.  What?  Did you work here at the...  Hey, hey, hey, hey.  Hey, potty mouth.  Wow.  Stop the cursing.  Irene, did you work at this station?  No.  I worked in the building.  Oh, what happened?  You got fired?  Mandatory retirement?  No, I quit.  I worked at a public relations firm.  Oh, Jesus.  You must have been great there. 
[02:20:00]  Why'd you quit?  Too many young, happy people?  No.  This was 20 years ago before the computer came out.  You're ancient.  Damn that computer.  That new thing.  That infernal device.  You want to see how ancient I am?  If you saw me, you wouldn't believe it.  Yeah, blame the computer.  Yeah, big deal.  I'd put it in a lot of people.  So what if I...  Everyone knows when a secretary hits 40, you've got to get rid of them.  I've seen plenty of gorgeous 60-year-olds.  Look at Loretta Young.  You were going to ask me for money?  Loretta Young, do you know that Ursula Andress is 65 years old? 
[02:20:30]  Exactly.  And she's hot.  Would you protect Ursula Andress?  No, I wouldn't.  You are bad.  But she's not an obnoxious, potty-mouthed, jealous old lady.  You are.  I am not a jealous old lady.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Irene, take your teeth out.  All right, Irene.  I don't know who you are.  You don't know who I am.  Irene.  Irene.  Irene.  Irene.  Irene.  Irene.  Irene.  Irene.  All right, hold on.  Hold on.  Irene.  Irene.  We want you down here in the studio. 
[02:21:00]  Why?  We want to take a look at you.  If I'm wrong, I will admit and apologize.  I don't think you would be mentally healthy for me.  Why?  You got mental problems, don't you?  Because I don't like the way you operate.  I don't like the soft points.  Irene, what kind of medication are you on?  Be honest.  You're on antidepressants, right?  I should.  My boyfriend died on my bathroom floor between three years ago.  You see what I mean?  Do you see what I mean?  You see what I mean? 
[02:21:30]  This is why I won't come down.  Oh, God.  Why are you laughing?  No, no, no, no, really.  Why are you laughing?  Irene, I agree.  Stop that anymore.  I want to know why you're laughing.  Irene, I agree.  Tell me why you're laughing.  No, no, no.  What happened?  I'm sorry.  That ain't cool.  Irene, what happened?  And that's all you have to say.  I'm sorry.  I didn't do it.  What happened?  What happened?  Hold on, hold on.  Hold on.  Why did you say you're sorry?  What happened?  Hold on, Irene.  Yes.  What happened?  I'm not feeling too good about myself, and I apologize.  Apology taken.  So what happened in the bathroom?  What happened, Irene, in the bathroom?  He died of heart failure. 
[02:22:00]  What?  What are you doing?  He died of what?  Why is that laughter in the background?  He died of what?  No.  I wanted that laughter in the background stopped.  He was a great guy.  He was a wonderful, cool guy.  You would love him if you knew him.  Irene, what happened on that bathroom floor?  What did he die of?  Heart failure.  Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.  See what I mean? 
[02:22:30]  You see what I mean?  You see what I mean?  Apologize.  That's why I won't come down.  Apologize.  Irene, look.  Apologize to you.  Irene, listen.  This is Opie.  I apologize for Anthony.  Anthony is a son of a bitch.  He's had a tough, tough year or two.  I just want...  I don't care about me.  Apologize about my boyfriend making fun of the people who died.  That's all.  He's not going to hear the apology.  Yes, he is.  I believe in life after death.  Yeah, but he's taking a dirt nap.  Yeah, he's rotting somewhere.  Don't worry about it.  He's not rotting.  There is an afterlife. 
[02:23:00]  He's fully alive and he's listening to you.  He's not.  He is.  Why do you have a vested interest in not believing in the afterlife?  When do you think his jaw dropped?  Yeah.  Let me tell you something.  He went bye-bye in the box.  I could show you pictures of him that would put you to shame.  He was a gorgeous guy and he's still alive.  He's still alive.  He crossed over.  He's still alive.  Shots and he's still alive.  How long were you dating Virgil Salazzo?  30 years.  30 years? 
[02:23:30]  30 years.  Why didn't he marry you?  Wait, I want to hear the story.  This is very serious.  Why are you doing this?  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  All right.  30 years.  Hold on, Irene.  So what happened?  He went into the bathroom to take a, what, a bath?  No, no.  I came home one day and he said he was in bed and he said, I said, what's wrong?  And it was six o'clock.  He said, oh, I think I have the flu.  I said, oh, you know, like I was like, you know, I said, okay.  So I just went about my business, which is, and then.  Are you feeling guilty that you didn't bring him to a hospital at that point? 
[02:24:00]  I mean, about that dying?  I had nothing to do with it.  No, no.  About not bringing him to a hospital.  Maybe you should have taken him to a hospital and said he was sick.  Oh, yeah.  There was talk of that and I thought it was the flu.  There was no clutching of the chest or a pain or anything.  So we thought he had the flu.  So he was even, like, getting up and going to the refrigerator now and then.  Yeah.  He did keep going to the bathroom.  So I figured, gee, he must have a virus.  Right.  Two o'clock in the morning, I'm woken up and my, his uncle was living with us. 
[02:24:30]  Yeah.  You know, his uncle didn't, never married.  Right.  I said, what is that noise?  He's a kid guy.  And I said, what noise?  He said, I heard somebody, a commotion in the bathroom.  And then I heard some guy say, help me, help me.  Oh, no.  And I said, well, I went in there and I still thought it was the flu.  And I go in there and I say, what's wrong?  Yeah.  And he says, he couldn't answer me.  And so we moved him, but it was like moving dead meat.  Oh, boy.  So I called the ambulance and I saw him sit up, look straight ahead of me as if he was looking at something. 
[02:25:00]  Yeah.  And there was no pain.  There was no screaming.  There was no yelling.  There was no clutching of the chest.  And he said, I'll be all right.  I'm going to be all right.  I said, oh, yeah?  Oh, that's great.  So I turned my back, called the ambulance.  Ambulance came, one, two, three.  Didn't let us see anything.  Put us in the police car to drive us to the hospital.  Yeah.  The police car wasn't moving.  And then they came back and said, that's it.  He's finished. 
[02:25:30]  You think that's fine?  Can I have an apology?  Can I have an apology?  Oh, yeah.  Can I have an apology?  Yeah, we make it okay by just apologizing.  I'm really sorry.  I am sorry.  Okay.  Okay, but listen to this.  We're obviously going for a cheap laugh.  Yeah.  So, I'm sorry.  Okay.  But the point is, is that I don't like your soft porn.  I don't know why you degrade certain people.  You know what?  You're actually right.  And you know what?  I don't like... 
[02:26:00]  I think I know why you're doing it.  I mean...  Because nobody would be listening.  I mean, you're right.  You're right.  You know what?  And I don't like annoying, lazy girlfriends who tell their boyfriends to go back to bed when  they're having heart pain.  They're not...  He wasn't having heart pain.  My God.  See the signs next time.  What?  Yeah, maybe if you weren't thinking about your beauty sleep, you would rush them to the hospital.  There was no heart pain.  There was no pain at all.  You're feeling guilt, aren't you?  No, I'm not.  Yeah.  Why don't you talk to John Edwards?  John Edwards?  I watched him.  He's wonderful. 
[02:26:30]  Maybe he can put you in touch with your boyfriend.  No, no.  I'm not interested in that.  I like Gary Zuko.  Your boyfriend can yell at you for not taking him to the hospital.  Have you ever heard of Gary Zuko?  No.  No, why?  Did he also kill someone he loved by laziness?  What?  Who is he?  Wasn't he the guy that hung around with John Travolta in Greece?  No, no, no.  No, it was Danny Zuko, right?  Find out who he is.  Oh, I forgot.  The point is...  Maybe your husband...  Maybe your husband faked his own death to get away from you.  Yes.  I wish.  I really wish.  Because that would be better than what's now. 
[02:27:00]  You were going to ask me for money?  I'm a very sexy chick.  Oh, no, man.  Here's $20 for a cab.  What?  I know Sylvia Miles.  You didn't get it.  No, I didn't get it.  Was it your boyfriend or your husband?  Well, it was like a common law.  All right.  30 years and you never put a ring on your finger.  Doesn't that tell you how aggravating you can be?  I told you she was black.  We had a bond where that...  Irene, I know this is going to be a little uncomfortable for you, 
[02:27:30]  but what were his last words to you?  I'm all right.  I'm all right.  So you're a Kenny Loggins fan?  What?  What?  I don't understand what you're saying.  He seemed to be looking past me as if he was seeing something.  Probably some softcore porn.  I don't know.  Oh, yeah, right.  Probably a hot young chick walking past the ambulance.  No, no, no.  Yeah, right.  That's funny.  He just said, I'm okay. 
[02:28:00]  Yeah.  I feel fine.  I said, oh, that's good.  And I turned around and I'm not psychic at all.  I can't...  I don't have any premonitions of anything.  Right.  You sure don't.  Especially...  I even heard the low-flying plane at the World Trade Center.  It was right there.  Oh.  And I thought it was just a low-flying plane.  I wanted to see it.  It was, you idiot.  I thought I'm fascinated with low-flying planes.  We all are.  Fascinated by low-flying planes.  I think we all are, yeah.  Did you try to catch them in a butterfly net?  I have no premonitions and no psychic ability at all. 
[02:28:30]  Irene, I have a tape of your boyfriend's last words, actually.  No, no, no.  Could you shut up?  Could you shut up?  No, what was...  Quiet.  What was his final words again?  I'm okay.  I'm fine.  I thought it was I'm all right.  You just messed up my...  What's the difference?  What is the difference?  You should remember the last words.  What was it?  It was I'm all right, you said.  I just told you.  I'm all right.  Nobody put up on me.  Why you got to give me a bite?  Look, um... 
[02:29:00]  Can't you get...  Nice words.  Turn it out, are you okay?  Go to the left.  You got to give me a bite.  Why don't you just let me in?  Do what you like.  Do what you like.  Go back to bed.  I'm having a heart attack.  Listen.  Listen, man.  Listen.  Greetings, grabber.  Oh, my God. 
[02:29:30]  Uh...  Uh...  Uh...  I'm still waiting.  There's no problem at the medical alert button.  You're so much better.  I'm falling.  I can't get up.  I can't get up.  Hey, low-life.  Hey, low-life. 
[02:30:00]  Hey, low-life.  Uh...  Low-life.  Better than no-life.  No-life.  I want to know something.  Wait, let them laugh.  Who are you trying to please?  The teenagers?  Do you want to make it entertaining?  Everybody with a live spouse.  I know.  You know what?  You're boring.  You are such a boy.  You just want to be like funny.  You think you're so different, but you're so mainstream.  It's not funny. 
[02:30:30]  This has been done before.  Don't you understand?  We're cakes for nothing.  That was the last word.  We're cakes for nothing.  It sure beats falling on the bathroom floor.  The old lady's got a dirty mouth.  Motherfucker.  What's that about?  Shut up! 
[02:31:00]  Hey, everyone.  We're all going to get laid.  Old school.  Hey, wait a minute.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:31:30]  You want me to be?  You want me to be?  I'd love to have you.  What?  Get the hell out of our way.  It's obvious this guy's having a heart attack.  Apologize.  You said to me, you English. 
[02:32:00]  Apologize.  Here's the boyfriend on the other side.  I'm moving in now.  Hey, I'll apologize.  Hey.  Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.  I know what happened.  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  They dumped out about that.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Hold on, hold on.  They're dumping out like crazy.  Yeah, we've got to let the...  Man, you've got to hear this lady say the word mother effer.  It is scary when it comes out of her mouth.  Hey, you know what, Julie?  All right, what? 
[02:32:30]  Irene, you want me to come down?  Did you stand up in the tub in The Shining and he had a heart attack when he saw you?  Is that what happened?  You want to see?  Uh, no.  You want me to come down?  You want to come down?  You want me?  We'd have you come down.  Then why don't you apologize right now for everything you've done, whether it was necessary  to get ratings or not?  We're not the ones who ignored our loved one.  I didn't ignore anybody.  Yeah, you did.  You wanted to go back to bed.  You were a little tired.  No, what you said doesn't affect me at all.  I just want an apology.  Huddle a huddle.  I want an apology for that little... 
[02:33:00]  No, I won't.  Don't blame me.  I don't want your cigarettes or your cigarettes.  I want my dead fiancé.  Apologize.  What were his last words?  Apologize.  I got him right here.  Oh!  Oh!  Help me!  Help me!  Help me!  Somebody help me!  Help me!  Help me!  Wait, do that again, Ed.  Apologize.  I'll play the part of Irene.  All right.  Oh!  Oh!  Help me!  Help me!  Help me!  Somebody help me! 
[02:33:30]  Help me!  Help me!  Ouch!  Ouch!  Ouch!  Ouch!  Apologize now.  I don't...  You better apologize.  What's that, sleepyhead?  Hey!  Don't make fun of no dead people!  We're not making fun of your inability to see that he was dying, stupid.  Oh, please.  That doesn't affect me in the least.  The whole left side of my body shut down.  That must be a head cold.  It's just a stretch. 
[02:34:00]  I'm here, flesh wound.  Hey, ugly.  Ugly.  Ugly.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I would not...  I knew that would...  Sweet, merciful crap!  You're right.  I am ugly.  Look for everything to you.  I knew that would get your attention.  Well, I'd hate to look like bones in a box.  Yeah.  Apologize.  All right.  I'm sorry you had no ability to act when someone you love dated you.  Um, I just want an apology for that stint you just did.  That was good, right?  Is the boyfriend.  What the hell were you seeing?  I have no trust and no regrets about that night. 
[02:34:30]  Just apologize for what you just did.  No guilt at all, huh?  Hey, Sleeping Beauty needs an apology.  Would you give it to her?  Yes, I need it.  The prince should have put nitroglycerin under your tongue to watch you.  Hey, uh, Mr. Comedian, uh, I never heard of you, but, uh, shut up.  Of course you didn't hear about me.  You're too busy sleeping and going to waste.  Sleeping and going to waste?  Ow!  Here he is.  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Apologize!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow! 
[02:35:00]  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Okay, that's all.  I'm not, I thought it was kind of silly.  Well, I don't care what you think, you're not even a person.  Huddle a, huddle a.  You're not even a person.  I am so a person.  Yeah, Jim, you're awful.  It was Jim that was pushing all those buttons.  Who the hell came in anyway?  I apologize.  Jim, Jim hides behind his button pushing ability.  I'm a button pushing punk.  Here's Irene right, uh, as she knelt over him in the bathroom.  You can act like a man!  What do I want to do?  Listen, I need a job. 
[02:35:30]  What did the EMS worker say, excuse me, ma'am, but your bath mat is talking?  Yeah, this is getting boring.  Why don't you hang up?  It couldn't be more boring than that lonely apartment.  Lonely empty bed.  All right, uh, Irene, we're, uh, we're, uh, we're, uh, we're out of time.  Look, I just want, I think that you degrade people like those two women who come there.  Those two women?  Why do you degrade them like that?  Non-pluralizing murderers?  Why do you have, why do you deal with such the fourth porn? 
[02:36:00]  Because I think it's disgusting.  I don't like the fourth porn.  Those two women?  And I don't like, I don't like you degrading people.  They're called women.  I don't like you degrading those two women.  Hey, Irene, Irene.  They're idiots, I know.  But why do you degrade them?  Irene, we gotta go, we gotta go.  We have to go.  We gotta go.  We gotta go.  We're just hanging up on you, okay?  Aw, the ambulance worker sounded like he, uh, he had some hope here at the end.  We're gonna get through this, but we just gotta keep your chin up.  Aw, let's just stick with me and then we'll turn this thing around.  All right. 
[02:36:30]  Aw, my stomach hurts.  I love you.  Don't you do it!  Don't!  You!  I got nowhere else to go!  I got nowhere else to go!  I got nowhere else to go!  Thank you.  Ah, I got nowhere.  Jesus.  I got nowhere else.  If you're happy and you know it, clench your chest.  All right, stop. 
[02:37:00]  Why couldn't she have called at 520 today?  Oh, I know.  Instead we had to listen to Voss and his stupid golf games.  Something tells me they'll be hearing that at 520 tomorrow anyway.  Oh, yeah, less work for us tomorrow.  The Opie and Anthony FU line is there for you.  When life sucks.  Sucks to be me.  Call anytime.  212-830-3785.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Where is the 7th?  The Opie and Anthony Show.  WNEW. 
[02:37:30]  Wow, where did the time go?  Goddamn.  We got this beast outside the studio that's entering the WOW Contest.  We can't even bring her in now.  I know.  We ran out of show, Anthony.  So Stinky's going to take her pictures.  They'll be up on OpieandAnthony.com tomorrow.  Not many ladies entering the WOW Contest the last couple days.  I'm getting a little worried.  Yes, Anthony?  Yes.  I'm just still laughing.  The funniest line during that whole exchange, and Mike from Staten Island thinks so too. 
[02:38:00]  Non-pluralizing murderer.  You called her a murderer.  That's great.  I don't know what everyone else thought.  That was one of the funniest things I've heard in, I don't know, almost a year.  I don't know.  Almost a year.  I was laughing.  What's that?  Freaking.  Eh!  Eh!  Eh!  Eh!  Where is that one?  That is the best goddamn siren.  Oh, my God.  Eh!  And then it kicks in. 
[02:38:30]  I love when it kicks in.  Oh, there's traffic.  Traffic.  Get out of the way.  Someone dying in here.  Eh!  Got Irene's boyfriend in here.  Eh!  Eh!  Eh!  Eh!  Eh!  Thanks for giving us enough time to save this guy.  Look at that.  I learned that Kenny Loggins sung I'm Alright never sounded so good as it did during that bit.  You guys had me crying at work.  She almost killed the bit though.  We have it all set up.  So what was his final words, you know?  I'm okay.  I'm okay.  I'm okay. 
[02:39:00]  Is that a song called I'm Okay?  She doesn't like the WOW contest.  She doesn't like the WOW contest.  Maybe we can go into her bathroom and hold the WOW contest.  Alright.  Horrible.  Look, man.  Uh, Jason's been on hold for like the whole show.  Jason!  Oh, boys.  Hi, Angel!  You gotta make it fast, Jay.  We gotta like...  Her husband was the one that he had with the bathroom floor.  Alright, here we go.  Alright.  You ready?  Yeah.  Wait, what do you got?  9mm shotgun.  Ready?  Yeah.  Let's hear. 
[02:39:30]  What are you doing?  It's cool.  That's a moving.  That's like a moving.  Is that Half-Life or something?  Yeah, he's playing a video game.  All right, Jay.  Pew, pew, pew, pew, pew.  What an idiot.  A 9mm shotgun.  Shut up.  I thought he had a 9mm and a shotgun.  If there's ever been a sillier ghost, I have yet to meet him.  Oh, ho.  Alright, what did we learn today?  I don't know.  Sheep Lover.  I learned today, June 26, 2002, the day that Frenchy finally burnt out. 
[02:40:00]  Yes.  He also learned when you're a midget, you should stay in shape.  He also learned Mexico is a good place for 11-year-old prostitutes and diarrhea.  It's all sheep lover today, huh?  He also learned the Greek Picasso is not as great as the Pinchpot Mudworks.  Pinchpot Mudworks, man.  And finally, he learned sometimes it's good to have a grandma in the guest room, Anthony.  Right.  Jersey Gary learned the Wow Chicks from Cleveland must be really ugly if they had to send out 
[02:40:30]  the SWAT team to stop the photo shoot.  Whew.  Alright, there was so much we wanted to get to today.  Yeah.  Once again, we went off on some stupid tangents.  Well, it happens.  Anthony went to a movie last night.  There's some good stuff there for tomorrow.  A crappy movie.  We've got the spanking thing.  Spanking is a no-no now, Anthony.  Yeah.  And we'll find out tomorrow if Rich Voss will break a hundred.  Yep.  A strong old perfect baby girl.  I will.  You will not.  Alright. 
[02:41:00]  That girl was nuts.  12-year-old Gary.  What's up, bro?  Hey, guys.  Hi, little Gary.  Hey, Northern.  Wow.  Jesus Christ.  It was hysterical, but it was cringe.  I was cringing.  When she said his last words were MRA.  Hooray.  I cringe when you play that song.  Lil' Gary.  Look at him.  Lil' Gary.  Lil' Gary.  He deserves it.  Teenagers don't know what they know.  Well, you don't know that either.  Hey, I graduated for me and I'm learning. 
[02:41:30]  What did you graduate from?  Seventh grade.  Wow.  I mean sixth grade.  The sixth grade graduation.  Remember that one?  Yep.  No.  That's a huge accomplishment for Gary and his family.  Drop out now.  The rest of school doesn't do nothing.  Sure.  Good luck, son.  Stay in school.  Doing good.  He's the first one in his family to make it past the seventh grade.  Won't do you nothing no good.  Alright, Gary.  Thank you.  Alright.  Godspeed, young man.  Let's go to Chris.  Chris, what did you learn today?  Yo.  Hey, man. 
[02:42:00]  The last room?  Yep.  June never breaks the hundred?  Yep.  And say a plus word?  I'm alright.  Everyone remembers his last words.  I'm alright.  And all she wanted was an apology.  And then we apologize and everything's okay again.  Everything was smoothed over.  Then we get her worked up again.  But then we apologize.  Yeah.  I can't wait to hear that again.  I'd like to just grab her taffy ass and twist it.  Dylan from Jersey says the clip that that guy was playing on the phone was from Terminator 2.  It was?  Yeah.  Good ears.  Hey, Alan. 
[02:42:30]  What's up?  What's up, boys?  What's up?  I'm calling y'all from UNO, the University of New Orleans.  You've got the potty mouths on everybody today.  What type of talk is that?

Yeah, he does a radio show in New Orleans.  Instant feedback, the guy.  Oh, okay.  I've given you my damn email address, too.  Wow, Anthony.  I think we've got a love connection.  Looks like you've got a new sleeping partner.  Love connection, if I have.  How would you like a 62 inch cage stuck up your balloon knot?  I don't know.  I like that a lot.  God, he's in New Orleans.  Who, Jim would like it?  Alright, Alan, thank you.  Why do blind people talk loud?  Well, that was Richard for a second.  He's really loud, that guy.  Why would he like it?  I can't see.  Get a hold of yourself.  What a stupid show we had today.
