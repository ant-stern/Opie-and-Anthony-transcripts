<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a "worst of 2012" retrospective heavily featuring comedian Amy Schumer.  The segment played a montage of Schumer's outrageous on-air stories, including graphic details of her sexting experiences (one involving a "negotiation" for reciprocation), a date rape, and finger-banging a cab driver.  The hosts and Schumer discussed these events with explicit language.  The show then previewed upcoming guests: Ricky Gervais, Joe DeRosa, Tom Hiddleston, Shaq, Laszlo, Jim Brewer, Dr. Steve, and planned discussions about Chris Kyle and Alex Jones.

Next, a female caller shared traumatic experiences, including molestation and subsequent self-harm, prompting sexually explicit and crude humor from the hosts.  This transitioned into a humorous dissection of Dr. Steve's "awful" best man speech, riddled with inappropriate jokes about the bride and groom's accident and alcohol at an alcohol-free wedding.  Travis, a guest, also contributed commentary on weddings.

A phone call with Chris Kyle followed, detailing a bar fight with Jesse Ventura.  Alex Jones joined, questioning Kyle's account, leading to a heated debate with conflicting narratives and accusations of lying.  The discussion touched on war, media portrayal, and politics.  The segment concluded with further discussion of Kyle's account and Jones's skepticism, along with the hosts discussing their vacation, upcoming guests, and future show plans.  A subsequent call with Kyle reiterated his account of punching Ventura, with Jones again present, debating the veracity of the claim and offering to help arrange a meeting between Kyle and Ventura off-air.

Jim Brewer then recounted a hilarious story about accidentally setting his rental house on fire with fireworks during a Fourth of July celebration, detailing their escape from arrest and cover-up.  Laszlo from Rockstar Games joined in studio, discussing the security challenges of filming Max Payne 3 in Brazil, including navigating favelas and dealing with local gangs, as well as the high taxes on imported games.  Shaquille O'Neal's arrival in studio was mentioned at the end of this segment, requiring him to duck under an exit sign due to his height.

The Shaq interview commenced, noting his Beats by Dr. Dre headphones.  The conversation covered Shaq's comedy roasts (mentioning Kevin Hart), business acumen (referencing Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Magic Johnson), navigating public life and controversial statements, his philosophy of authenticity, and his Dove Men+Care endorsement.  He shared childhood anecdotes, including a fight with Boomer Esiason and a fear of financial ruin, his education, business savvy, opinions on NBA players (calling LeBron James a “bore”), MMA training, and thoughts on various fighters.  The interview was interrupted by a man resembling someone from an A&E biker show.  The segment concluded with further discussion of endorsements, a planned "shirt off" competition with Charles Barkley, the "Worst of 2012" segment featuring Chip Chipperson, the introduction of a party game called "Words Back," a humorous anecdote about Paul Lind and a tragic event, and a discussion regarding Shaq's past experiences with prostitution.

The show continued with chaotic and vulgar banter between the hosts and "Chip Lynn," involving word games and fixation on Troy's penis.  A heated argument ensued, filled with insults, homophobic slurs, and graphic sexual references, targeting Chip's family and lifestyle.  A phone interview with Tom Hiddleston promoting *The Avengers* followed, touching on his role as Loki and accents. Finally, Ricky Gervais and Joe DeRosa joined in studio for a vulgar and humorous discussion about Bailey J and Buck Angel, culminating in a debate about which they would rather have sex with, punctuated with numerous crude jokes and offensive remarks.

[00:23:30]  To in bed  I think some concessions  Can be made  As to what you  You know  Well that's a verbal  Contract in the text  I will now read  From paragraph 3  Section 2  You did say  You would lick  My ass off  Now you're denying that  I'll write something  I'll write something  Really sexy  Like um  I'm going to put you  On your stomach  And fill your buns  How are you single  What  I know  What a catch 
[00:24:00]  Chivalry  I'm going to put my  Hard hot dog  In between your buns  Oh my god  You're honestly  Going to leave here  A lesbian  I'm going to pound you  And I'll say  I'm going to pound you  Slow  Then fast  Then slow  Then fast  And I'll write  Like 30 times  Keep going  Slow then fast  And I'm going to tease you  With my fucking helmet  And I'll say  Fucking helmet  Fucking helmet  Helmet  Oh these poor women  Oh  Yeah  And men  Yeah  I'll say  Dear androgynous 
[00:24:30]  You know what  Women like too  When you tell them  I'll fucking  My tongue is going to be  All chafed and shit  Like a cat tongue  After I'm done  After I'm done  Licking down there  Oh my god  I want like  The first text  To be  Like right when she goes  So  What would you do  Like we're just  Us getting into it  I would dry dick you  In the ass  Hard and deep  The first  The first fucking one  Right out the gate 
[00:25:00]  Right out the gate  See how far that goes  Or just  Or just fire out  Dry dick you  Any girl that doesn't  Just block you  Is a keeper  Come on  Definitely  Or you just  You fire out  Random what ifs  Like  Not that I'm into this  But do you mind  If a guy shits in your mouth  If a guy shit in your mouth  Would you swallow it  Spit it out  Or just comment on the girth  But that would be 
[00:25:30]  At least funny  Yes  She goes  What are you doing  Right into  I'm gonna  Dry dick you  Your ass  Hard and deep  In the ass  Oh my god  And then  And then like  Dot dot dot  Blood  This is ONA's  Worst of 2012  So far  On the Opie and Anthony channel  Do you want to talk about that thing  No  Oh my god  Please  No  Do you want to talk about it in general 
[00:26:00]  Like without any details  How do you know  It might not be the same thing  Oh you guys are so horrible  It might not be the same thing  No we won't spoil any details  I won't give any details out  You don't want to give out  I bet you guys were like  The best date rapists in college  Like look  We're just  Come home with us  We're not  We're gonna watch a movie  Like we will not touch you  Yeah  Just the tip  Yeah  This hanky has my cologne in it  Trust me  Smell it  Oh god  Were you a victim of date rape ever  One of my boyfriends kind of raped me 
[00:26:30]  That's kind of how I lost my virginity  Really  Really  How old were you  That's so fucking hot  I was like 17  I mean  That's horrible  What happened  I was 17  I was like  We were drinking  And hanging out  And then  And I passed out  And I woke up  And I go  We'd never had sex  And I go  What are you doing  And he goes  I thought you knew  And I go  What  Like for him to say that right away  Yeah  Sounds like an erotic excuse  Yeah I think that kind of stuff happens  But I think that kind of stuff happens 
[00:27:00]  Wait he was already having sex with you  He was having sex with me  And you woke up  I woke up to him having sex with me  Oh no  It's a magic time  Yeah I was like mom I'm a woman  I sat on her bed  Did you have a certain glow about you  Like oh  Blood  Blood  Blood  I had a little halo of blood around me  That's exactly how you pictured it  Growing up  Yes  Just as you imagined growing up  It was like Twilight  Guys are really fucking heinous  Were you drunk?  No  I was a little drunk yeah  A little drunk  Well I guess I was asking for it  Did he finish or did you stop him? 
[00:27:30]  I stopped him  I was like hey  I thought we were gonna  You know I'm not  Can we get a hotel  Maybe go see a movie first  Right  It's not against plucking away any virginity  Or things like that  But  You gotta make it kinda nice  You know  Yeah at least like pretend like it's consensual  Like I think  That's become my favorite sex  Consensual  Consensual is my fave  Virgins do nothing for me  I don't like innocents  No  Not even if they're asleep  No  I'm like a sleepy slut  I'm not saying I wouldn't fuck a girl 
[00:28:00]  Who's been around the block a few times  Yeah  But uh  Wow so he was fucking you  Yeah I'm not trying to minimize that by the way  I don't think that was cool  But it's been a long time  Since then I've had a nice array of cuck  So I'm uh  Yeah I have no feelings left about it  Did you see him  I don't think that's cool to do guys  You didn't see him after that  Um  We broke up pretty soon after that  Was it awkward  But not even because of that  Um  It was  We went and visited a college together the next day  Aw  Aw that's nice  And you're just like  Was it all 
[00:28:30]  That was on your mind  I was like  I was like  Where I pee hurts  Uh  Yeah  It was all that was on my mind  For sure  Poop hurts  Yeah you know  I should be grateful  I should be grateful  Yeah  Did you feel like you'd been raped  Or was it because it wasn't violent  You felt like it was like  Just a weird thing  It was just a weird thing  Like oh  That was one of those things that  Um  I you know  I felt really weird about it  For a couple weeks  And then it kind of  Blew over  And then years later  I was like  Wow that was not  That's not cool  Oh man 
[00:29:00]  That's not a good way to  For a few years  Yeah  And then came back  And haunted you a little  Yeah a little bit  I mean  Yeah  I've never talked about it  In therapy actually  Oh  Well you might want to  Is that what this is  Yeah because  Oh my god  Now a lot makes sense  I've never confronted him  As far as you  There's a lot  People are saying  People are saying to slow down  And tell the story a little slower  Yeah that's a  Slower  You know when we were growing up  I don't think the term  Date rape even existed  No  Do you think that qualifies  As date rape  It was like my boyfriend  Yes  Yeah 
[00:29:30]  Yes  But they might classify that  As sexual misconduct  Like legally there's a weird thing  Where rape I think  Has a certain amount of violence  And like when she says no  If you put it in any way  Like there's a weird thing  With dating  Where it's called  Sexual misconduct  Which it shouldn't be  Yeah  I mean it's just a non-violent rape  Right  She was like unconscious  That's fucking  Maybe  But then I also  I know people who  This never happened to me  But they're like  Start having sex  And then  And then the  The girl falls asleep  And the guy finishes 
[00:30:00]  Ah right  That's a gray area  That is  I don't  I think I'd be like  What?  But I mean  I don't know  I've never fallen asleep  I've had like two guys  Fall asleep  While they were going down  On me  Oh man  I just like  Knead them in the ear  Holy shit  Back to work  That's hilarious  What do you got  Nitrous?  You pussy's boring everyone  Pussy tells bad stories  I know  Oh god  Yeah  No we're just wasted  But that's another one  Of those things  Guys wouldn't give a fuck  If they were date raped  That would be pretty tough 
[00:30:30]  By another man they would  Yeah  Yeah  Obviously  But  But if it's by a girl  No I would  I'd be like  Oh alright  But like for you to be asleep  It seems so much more difficult  Yeah of course  To rape a guy  Yeah  There's just different rules for guys  I mean I'll try it  Give it a whirl  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  Hey you were asleep  You were fucking drunk  Yeah  You never talk about that in therapy  No  I've never talked  Maybe I should  But I don't  Your first sexual experience  Was a rape  Yeah  You might want to 
[00:31:00]  You might want to  Bring that up  You put it like that  What are you talking about in therapy  Right  And he wouldn't get off the phone  When the fucking phone calls  He was 20 minutes late  I'm in therapy yes  I was sleeping  He wouldn't stop  He just keeps throwing  That type of stuff in  I can't wait to see  The bullet points from today's show  Amy's rape  Yes  Vinny's phone calls  Amy's rape  Yeah  The fact that it was your first time  Is really hot  No that's  That's the thing  That's like wow  Terrible  That might have set you down a road  If you were already  Like a slut  And you know  You pass out  And the guy's fucking you 
[00:31:30]  That's one thing  But first time age  I feel like I've been  This could be completely insane  I feel like sexually pretty healthy  Yeah  He goes  Yeah  Do you  Yeah really  Are you healthy  Why is that  I don't know  And make sure he speaks slow  I don't know  I feel like  I'm sure it must have done some damage  But I don't know  What makes you feel like  You might be unhealthy  Or healthy  Like is it the detached  Completely psychotic way  You can just walk away from somebody 
[00:32:00]  Is that the healthy part  You're talking about  Oh my god  That is so funny  I mean  I don't think  I think I'm a sociopath  But not because of that  It's hard to tell though  With sex  If it's like  I feel pretty normal sexually  Because sex is such a  Wacky fucking thing  That could go  You know  You could take some areas  That people would find  Repulsive  And other people  That's totally fucking cool 
[00:32:30]  That's what I like  But what  Is it something from your past  That puts you on the road  Where you like this  But don't like this  And stuff  So it's hard to tell  It's hard to use sex  As a basis  If you're fucking crazy or not  Yeah  Because it's so  You know  Yeah and you know what  I'm realizing  I like  Sometimes I like porn  Where the girl's sleeping  And the guy wakes her up  Like that  Well of course you do  Well you know what it is  That's where all those weird fetishes come from  I think it's like  Something happened to you  Yeah  I think it's like  I thought of it as like  That was like guiltless sex  When I watch it now 
[00:33:00]  But at the time  I was like  I remember being very surprised  And upset  Yeah yeah  It's like that Godfather 2 scene  When fucking Don Quillione comes home  And they walk in  Surprise  Let's show Carlo to rape  It is exactly  A lot of questions coming in  Brandon in Missouri  Was Amy naked  Or did he take her clothes off  I don't remember  I mean I don't think  He would have undressed me  It's tough to get jeans off  If the girl's sleeping  Really tough  No I didn't wear jeans  I was another 15 pounds  But if you like 
[00:33:30]  If you like that sleeping sex videos  That's so weird  It's like people take  People fetishize  If that's the word  What hurts us  You know what I mean  We make it sexual  What's traumatic  Because there's a naughtiness to it right  Yeah  It's a way of owning something  That can be all encompassing  Or it's a way of  Controlling something  Which can be so crushing  And damaging  And hurtful  Oh yeah  Yeah it's a way of controlling it  That makes sense  But then all the other porn I watch  Has never happened  And I do not want it to happen  Like what? 
[00:34:00]  I've  I've  Like what?  I've never stopped myself  From saying something in here  And that was the first time  Give us a good one  Interracial DP  Did you see that?  Yeah  Yeah  I mean  Yeah definitely  But you don't want this to happen to you  But it's a turn on to watch it  Yeah  I think we all got some of that shit in us  I don't even like watching interracial  I know you don't  It's so disturbing to me  Yeah  Because all I'm thinking is  What happened to her?  Where's dad?  That she's there right now  What did her ex do wrong? 
[00:34:30]  Oh man  How bad did her ex fuck her  That he sent her in this direction?  Who raped her first?  Yeah yeah  She was sleeping at some point  Is she like the interracial DP?  I've kind of gotten into  Some interracial stuff too  Yeah  Yeah  I mean I've sort of taken a break from that  I don't even like the white guys  With the black chicks interracial  Like none of that gets me  You don't even want somebody to have a tan  No  No  I like pale English people  Having sex with each other  They don't like cousin Oliver  Anthony can't come  Oh my god 
[00:35:00]  Just powder jerking off  Nice and pasty  Oh poor Amy  That's terrible  Oh no  Now we know why you're a comic  And a funny one at that  Yeah  Oh god  There was so much damage  Way before that  Yeah  Come on  That was late in the game  I was like get in line  With the rest of this damage  Alright hey thanks for that  Here's the other guys  That damaged me  Just stand on that line  Sorry  Yeah but you know  It was a  It was an experience  Did you watch Friday Night Lights?  No  No  Alright well  There goes that 
[00:35:30]  Yeah but people out there have  So explain it  Well I just  There's one scene with Connie Britton  The mom  And she's talking to her kid  Her daughter's like  I'm thinking about having sex  Uh oh  And she's young  And she's kind of like  Well if you  She's like don't have sex yet  Like you're not ready  And she's like why  What's the big deal  And her mom freaks out  She's like it can harden you  And it can  And she like listens to her mom  And I was like  When I watched that  I was like oh yeah  Oh man really  Yeah I think  I think it did  I think there is a good amount of that 
[00:36:00]  Yeah I guess you can't avoid it  How long did you date them  Before you did that?  We were together for like  A year  Well it's hard to trust people  After that too  When somebody you're dating  Or you're supposed to be  You know  Yeah  A year and you aren't  Fucking them though  Jesus Christ  We were 16  We got together  I was a late bloomer sexually  Yeah  Yeah and then shit really hit the fan  And then he made up for lost time  That's like being robbed by somebody though  It's like somebody you trust  And you love  And they fucking take somebody  That's fucking awful  How long did you stay with them  After the fact? 
[00:36:30]  Um  Maybe like  A couple months  And then we went to college  Oh that was the thing  That kind of  Yeah  Separated you to  Well  Not really  Did you have sex again?  But those couple months  Ever?  With him?  No no I mean  Yeah we started having sex  Not right after  But what's in the back of your head  Like I know that was wrong man  He had to know that  I wasn't ready for that  I feel like I  Like  I didn't  I thought about it for a little while  And then I totally put it out of my head  Right  I think  Yeah that must have been like  Me trying to control it 
[00:37:00]  I mean the implications  Are just too awful  I mean if it's a stranger to a party  That's one thing  But if it's somebody you're dating  And there's a certain trust there  You know what just  But honestly  I don't think  I'm not minimizing it  But I just know so many girls  That had experiences like that  Right  The instant feedback is lit  People like  Guys are really  So many girls  Feel like they got  Date raped in college  Oh my god  So many  It's so many  And then it's  That's the thing  It's like  And you know  They're always like  Oh people don't report it  Because it's like  I didn't want to send that guy to jail 
[00:37:30]  Like you know  He had been my boyfriend  It's such a  Yeah it's such a gray area  But I know so many girls  That it's like  Because then also you know  Then had I like reported it or something  Then you become like this  And were you drinking  And were you whatever  And then you're  The total bad guy  So it's just  Man it's  It's a total  Yeah it's a total gray area  Wow man  Fuck  That's  That's  Light morning  This is light FM  Yeah  The fact that you never talked about it in therapy 
[00:38:00]  Is weird  Could be taking your rape calls  Yeah  Why don't you talk about it  You might have to know  I don't know  Because I'm always  I'm always in a relationship  And just having sex with that guy  And it's dirty with that guy  But I  Like  It's monogamous  And I  And there's like  Love going on  Aw  You know but I mean  I  Not  It's not  It's never  I don't like real like love making  Like I like  To fuck  Right  Right  But I don't know  I never  I never stop crying  Not a tender loving  No I don't  I don't  That makes me uncomfortable 
[00:38:30]  Really  Yeah I don't like that  Hilarious  Yeah  I wonder why  Because Jimmy's like that too  Jimmy's talked about that  I don't like it slow at all  I go like  It all depends  It depends on the person  And the mood  And everything  Yeah  Like whether  You know  I'll change it up a little bit  I have a good  Pitch repertoire  I can go  I can go to the fastball  I can go to the fucking knuckleball  You got the knuckleball?  Sinker  Yeah  Yeah  What about the slider?  I've got knuckleballs 
[00:39:00]  Yeah  Ow  Ow  Jesus  There are certain times  Where it's appropriate  It just seems appropriate  To be a little slow  And more romantic  And fucking corny  And then there's just  Fucking bend over  And you know  Let's get this done in five  And fucking get out  And do something  I can only fuck really hard  If I'm making noises  Like Al Molinaro  From Happy Days  If I'm holding her ass  And I'm going  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  Imagine being that girl  That's got  That poor girl  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah 
[00:39:30]  Right in her ear  What a treat  Yeah  What a treat  Yeah  She knows I'm ready to come  And I sink my teeth  Into her cheek  Big fear  Oh my god  Yeah  Bite out a chunk  Of cheek meat  I got you there  Bitch  That's awful  Amy  That's a terrible story  Oh I'm sorry  No I feel bad for you  Not that you want me to  Oh I don't want you  To feel bad for me  I do  I feel okay  I was  I think we should all  I think we should all  Hug you  Don't we all  Have our fucking  That would be worse  I'm going to opt out  Of the hug  Is that okay 
[00:40:00]  We all have our shit  Though that we think  Should fuck us up  You know what I mean  It's like  It's like  Oh is that why I do this  And then the other thing  It's like  But everyone's got that shit  Right  And it all  It all like makes sense  If you  There's always  Some psychologist  That's like  Oh you have this  And you're like  Oh fuck  You want to be above it  But you're not  This is Opie Anthony's  Worst of 2012  So far  I want to have a story  To get out of Amy  Oh god I was like  Oh I don't know  If I want to talk about that  Why  Oh Amy  Why else are you here 
[00:40:30]  God  What do you mean  I'm uh  I'm  Wait it sounds like  You have a good story  Jimmy  It's up to her  He throws it out there  Yeah  I mean we've all had  Sexual dark days  I feel like last time  I was here  I remembered my sleep rape  And I shouldn't come back  In here this time  This is worse than the sleep rape  Really  Really  You remember something else  Yeah  Oh my god  More of my youth  Is coming back to me  And by youth I mean  Can we guess  Five years ago  You know what  And I might have even  Told the story on here 
[00:41:00]  I'm not sure  Did I ever talk about  When a cab driver  Fingered me on here  I don't think  I remember that one  I swear to you  It sounds familiar  Doesn't it  It kind of sounds familiar  I talk about it  A little bit on stage now  Maybe  Just as like the end of a thing  But I don't  I don't know if I told the story  But I would feel really awful  If I had already told the story  No I just remember  The one with the ship  I've heard it in your act  Oh the eating man on the ship  Oh no  Oh okay  You've only heard my act  Okay  Yeah  Amy and I took a cab home  From Top Hoppers last night  You figured Amy in the cab? 
[00:41:30]  No no no no  Wait  She figured my ass  Outside the cab  Before we got in  To propel me forward  That's sweet  No we were both  Amy lives not that far from me  So we split a cab going up  I forget how it came up  Well after you told the cab driver  To drive you back  To the luxury apartments  Oh yeah  And then you let him know  That I live in a six floor walk up  Oh that's good Jimmy  Yeah  No I told Amy to get out of her  Three fucking doors down  Because  She's talking about this guy  Oh  It's been a while since I've had sex 
[00:42:00]  I mean this time of year  I like to fuck  Oh no  She's saying this in the back of the cab  Oh yeah she's blathering on  I wasn't even thinking about it  I wasn't even thinking about it  And the fucking creepy cabbie  With two little scars on his cheek  Is hearing all this  Freaking out  I didn't even think about it  White cabbie  Yeah I guess sexually assaulted  White cabbies are the scariest cabbies  In New York City  But I said to her  He was white  I said get out of your fucking  A few doors away  Get out three doors away  I said to her  I'm like text me as soon as you get  So you know  I was sort of offended  He didn't go for it after that  Yeah right  She was loud though  I'm sorry 
[00:42:30]  I don't care  I didn't even think about it  I like to fuck  This time of year  That's how I sound  That's how I sound  Oh god  So what happened with the cab driver  Now you gotta tell the story  Oh god  It's so dark  It's bad  Alright  Take your time  When did this happen  A lot of details  This is so bad  When did it happen by the way  What were you wearing  I remember what I was wearing  Yeah what were you wearing  Oh Jesus  This is so awful  Could it be any less appealing  With my morning voice  I just walked in here  Oh don't worry  It's great  Lucille Ball  I sound like I have leprosy  Give me some  McGillicuddy finger  Viv came up 
[00:43:00]  How old were you  I was  Eighteen  Oh  Oh god  This is so awful  This is the worst  To tell  This is the worst  Okay  But it sucks  Eighteen  Because the weekend  After I left here  I was on the road  And then people  Who heard the show came  And whenever I would  Make a rape joke  They'd all be like  Aww  So now  When I say my  Super sweet fingering joke  They're all gonna be like  Ooh  Oh  Creepy  Okay  This is exactly what happened  Do tell  Okay  Okay  The summer of your senior year 
[00:43:30]  It was the summer  Okay  Okay  Okay it was the summer  It was  The summer going into my  Sophomore year  Of college  So  Yeah  Eighteen  Maybe I just turned nineteen  So  We were driving home from a bar  I was in the front seat of the cab  Front seat  All my friends are in the back  Oh okay  But I remember choosing  The front seat on purpose  Oh  Why  Um  Because I'm a huge whore  Wait  Did you  Did you get a look at the driver 
[00:44:00]  Before you chose the front seat  Yeah  And let me tell you  Disgusting  Wow  Nice  He was  He was like  Not  He looked like a cab driver  Right  I wasn't like  Oh we hit the jackpot  With the one hot cab driver  What city were you in  New York  Alright  What nationality was he  He was white  And what were you wearing  I was wearing a mini skirt  Oh boy  And a tube top  Which was my uniform at the time  Even though I was another good  Two dozen pounds  That I am right now 
[00:44:30]  Oh it's fantastic  I had no idea  A little chubby girl  In the front seat  I had no idea  Chubby anger  Great  Chubby anger  Just wanting those fingers  Oh god  Anything  So awful  Yeah  A little  No money for cab fare  My dad lives in the hospital  And like his friends  Listen to this show  Oh  They'll love it  It's true  They're gonna love this  They will miss  He's gonna be so proud  So I was sitting in the front  And my friends were in the back  Wasted  And sort of one at a time  They got out  And I was getting out  With my last friend  Who was like asleep in the back 
[00:45:00]  And I was just drunk  And I was going through a phase  Where I like to get in a lot of  Trouble sexually  And sort of do stuff  That scared myself  God  I would go home  It was fucking  This is great  I know  I am loving this  This is really hot  Wow  So  I hope you're not looking for sympathy  I just  This is such a mistake  I'm looking for cum  I'm regretting  I'm not only regretting coming here  I'm regretting ever doing comedy 
[00:45:30]  Yeah  So I just like was sort of  I think I just wanted to feel like  I was really  Turning him on  Like making him go out of his mind  So I just was sort of like  Like I just sort of kind of  Like was sliding my leg over to him  Why am I saying this on here?  I hate this  While you're driving in the cab  Or were you a part?  Yes  While he's driving  Where my friend was asleep  In the back  So you're opening your little  Chubby legs  You little chubby legs  I refer to them as sturdy back then  Okay 
[00:46:00]  So you're moving your left leg  Toward the cab driver  So he's driving  I'm just driving here  Imaginary driving  And then like  Right next to him  I need like a publisher  A leg starts moving closer  Don't just talk about  And he's probably like  Did he look over?  Yeah he looked over  Yeah  I bet he looked over  What is going on?  And then what happened?  And he sort of like  Was like  How does he make the move?  So gross  How does he make the move?  All right  He didn't make the move 
[00:46:30]  I took his hand  Oh my god  I knew it  This is the greatest thing ever  You took his hand  And just put it on your young  19 year old  18  I put it on my skirt  And  Wait wait where exactly  Did you put his hand?  On your left thigh?  Or did you put it ground zero?  I went right  Oh my god  I thought maybe  He like a little leg  So he could rub your leg  A little first  No  You went right for the  You said you put that  Foreplay  That hand that he coughed in  And was digging in his nose  All that bad money  Went through  He looked like 
[00:47:00]  Like the MTV cab driver  Remember that guy?  Like he was greasy  Oh wow  There was nothing  Like attractive about this dude  What a banner  Nice to the sky  So she's sleeping in the back  This guy must have  Lost his mind  And he  Yeah and I  You know we only had like  20 blocks to go  So I was like  This guy better get to work  Oh he probably fucking  Oh that guy  Is that hair  That really looks like him  So I bet you anything  This guy's like a listener  To this show  What's wrong with you?

Were you ready to accept him?  How dry does a girl have to be  That you can't get a finger in there?  Well that's  Wow  But yeah I was turned on  I was excited  Oh yeah  Just thinking about it  Did you have panties on?  Yeah  Okay so what did he  Pull them aside or did you do?  Moved them to the side  Oh my god  I moved them to the side  Oh you were just eager  You victimized him basically

I told her  I was like  It was sort of like  I think it was really  Selfish of me  Just want to get some  Guilt out of my life 
[00:50:30]  Wow  So what did she do  When you told her?

I was like  Oh mom  That's so much  Oh no  So what did she say to you?  I think she was concerned  Yeah  And  And she  But she was like  She comforted me  Like  It's okay  Like what do you say  To your daughter?  Mom  Um  There there

[00:56:30]  With one of these recently  I said no  He's like blow me  I'm not fucking  Going to an alcohol free wedding  Alcohol free weddings  Is so god damn selfish  Yes  You don't drink then  Maybe most of them  Were sober people though  Well how about  The poor drunks  That want to fucking drink  I sure wish that I had  Uh  Tywin on  The one I'm like  I do when I go to the office  He uh  He also spent the night  Googling  Funny sayings about marriage  Oh  Eww 
[00:57:00]  He should have Googled  He should have Googled  Things women use  In their vagina  That smell like vinegar  How many years ago  Was this Travis  Um  I'm not sure  Couldn't have been  That many though  Do you think  Do you think  Getting married  On a major holiday  Is selfish too  Yes  And they always  They always do that  Because they save money  Yeah  Because nobody else  Is getting married  I had to go to a  I had to go to a wedding  That was very  Very close to  Christmas Eve 
[00:57:30]  I'm like  Are you serious  I gotta run around  Like a lunatic  This weekend  And try to get  Some shopping done  I've got  People have them  On New Year's Eve  Fourth of July weekend  Labor Day weekend  One  The traveling is more expensive  If you're flying in  But the wedding hall  Is a lot cheaper  Well ours  Couldn't have been  Any cheaper  That's kind of  A humorous anecdote  It's kind of  Selfish to assume  That you're gonna  Spend the holiday  At someone else's  Someone's stupid wedding  Yeah Google  Some funny things  About marriage  Some funny slogans 
[00:58:00]  Yeah  From Scott Peterson  Yeah  Well Klaus von Bülow  The mother and child  Immersed in fluid  The unborn child  Could have been a doctor  Or scientist  Instead wound up with  Salt  What we call brine  On the brain  From being at the bottom  Of the ocean  That was it 
[00:58:30]  What year  I have no idea  Old Ben Gardner  Pussy  Yeah  Old head fell out  Christian Dreyfus  Open her legs  I was very scared  Mama D's for you  Yes  So what else  What other  No that was it  Oh that's it  For the background  On Dr. Steve's  I'm sure it'll be  Very best man speech  Now who is this for 
[00:59:00]  Is it for like  A close friend  Yeah this is for  Dr. Mengele  I'm a big fan  Of your work  Some funny anecdotes  He'd always put a  Lamb shit on his head  At parties  Yeah  Hey look  We see a lot of  Twins in the room  Twins  Yeah  Double vasectomy  Todd  Is that his name  Sam  Yes  From the weird  Medicine hour  One of the weird  Medicine guys  Oh yeah  Yes  Alright  Great  Dr. Lecter 
[00:59:30]  Yeah  One of my  Protege  Yeah  Thank you Barney  Yeah  I got really mad  Because I kept  Telling multiple  Megs to throw it  In my mouth  I was  Vescusy  Semen  He said  I could smell  Your boredom  There  Yeah  Okay  Dr. Steve  Funny  Marriage  Phrasing 
[01:00:00]  Yes  Dr. Steve  I'm not allowed  To speak  Extemporaneously  Because when I do  I'm hurt  Extemporaneously  At a speech  Extemporaneously  Myself  So  I say  Really inappropriate  Thing  So  I've got some  Notes here  Normally  This sounds  Very recent  Within the last  Couple of years  Really  Yeah  If he's googling  Then it's gotta be  And double vasectomy  Todd is not an old guy  This is like a  Valedictorian  So he can't even 
[01:00:30]  Use the excuse  That it happened  Years ago  It could  I mean it could have  Happened a few years ago  But no more than that  I would get up  And tell a lovely story  About how Todd and Ashley  Met  And how they fell in love  Unfortunately  No one knows  Wow  It's apparently  A big secret  We found out  About it on Facebook  Since I don't know  Anything clever  To say about marriage  I thought I'd consult  Some experts  In the field  Henny Youngman  Once said  The secret to a long  Happy marriage 
[01:01:00]  Remains a secret  And O.J. Simpson  Once said  You white bitch  I'm gonna cut your head off  I'm bombing up here  It's okay  It's real short  Mickey Rooney  Said this about marriage  Hey  Take me out of this room  My caregiver's  Punching me 
[01:01:30]  That's what Mickey Rooney  Said  He said I was cute  In 1948  And now my caregiver  Is hitting me  With my dirty diapers  Maybe I should shut up  About clean comedy  Because I was kind of stunk  I don't know why  People thought I was cute  That's what Mickey Rooney said  Mickey Rooney said  I should be dead like Andy  God marriage  Always get married  Early in the morning  That way  If it doesn't work out 
[01:02:00]  You haven't wasted  You haven't wasted  A whole day  Even Socrates  Spoke about marriage  Thousands of years ago  By all means marry  He said  If you get a good wife  You'll be happy  If you get a bad one  Become a philosopher  Now the Bible  The Bible discourse is on love  In 1 Corinthians 13  Love suffers long  And is kind  Love does not envy  Love does not parade itself  Is not puffed up  Love does not behave rudely 
[01:02:30]  Does not seek its own  Is not provoked  Thinks no evil  Love does not rejoice  In iniquity  But rejoices in the truth  Love bears all things  Believes all things  Hopes all things  Endures all things  Love never fails  Here's the other thing  Well it does fail  Me when I'm making a speech  That's horrific speech  Yeah  Hold a glass of apple juice  Peace and no alcohol wedding  Oh Christ  I give this speech  At the hospice  When I want people 
[01:03:00]  To not really want  To live anymore  Yeah  I'm the get them out  Get them out of their bed guy  When we have a long waiting list  I got old Mr. Hodges  To finally kick over  And give up  Talk to him with love anecdotes  He actually read that thing  They read at the weddings  I was sipping a Sierra mist  Here are some other things  That love doesn't say  Love doesn't say  What are you doing 
[01:03:30]  How about now  How about now  What are you doing now  How about now  Who was that that just called  Wow  I swear I'm almost done  Love doesn't ask  Does this kilt make my butt look bare  He's always a kilt  From what I hear  He wore a kilt at the wedding  Not Dr. Steve  Love is an electric blanket  With someone else  In control of the switch  As we raise our alcohol free glasses 
[01:04:00]  And remind our hosts  That Jesus' first miracle  In the Bible  Was turning water into wine  At a wedding  Todd and Ashley  I hope  You will be as happy  As Casey and I  Thought we'd be  Dr. Steve  It was short anyway 
[01:04:30]  That was good  Oh my god  Luca Brazzi  Was more comfortable  At the wedding  Than you were  Why  Why a non-alcoholic wedding  First of all  That is so selfish  I know he's your pal  But what the fuck  Well  I think  His wife's father  Is a minister  And he doesn't believe  In drinking  Although  No it's true  Oh so  So make your  Cater to your  The father there  Yeah  And you know 
[01:05:00]  His wife  Not loves to  You know  Go to the bars  And slam  Shots  And stuff  But she's never drunk  In front of her father  And you know  They were afraid  She'd probably have  A fucking issue  Did you do a few  Shots before you went  No I think  We had a flask  But I never got to it  Because it was just  You should have  A little booze  On that speech  Might have  Yeah  There were a lot of  You know  Christians there 
[01:05:30]  And I thought  It was a little edgy  And you know  In giving them  You know  A nudge  About the alcohol  Free wedding  But you know  And turning water  Into wine  But that was about  As edgy as I felt  I like your delivery there  At a wedding  I can picture  Hey Lottie  Lottie  Hey Lottie  Lottie  Yeah  You did a little  Valby there  John Valby  Yeah  I know a girl  Her name is Ashley  Hey Lottie  Lottie  Oh  Yeah 
[01:06:00]  That was  Non-alcoholic  Weddings suck  Because most weddings  In general suck  Why did you do the  And then you take the alcohol  Away on top of it  Why the biblical reading there  Didn't that happen  At the church anyway  Because it was a minister  But didn't that happen  At the church  Don't they read that  At the church  It looks like everyone  Was catering to the minister  They didn't  In their  In their  In their  Ceremony  But it was just  To get to the thing  That says  Well here's the other things  That  Oh  You were setting up 
[01:06:30]  Your gags  Right  You were using  The teachings of God  I get it  A bit of a long set up  But you know  I figured I'd  Suck them in  With the biblical  Revel  You sucked  I liked it  Get right to the kilt jokes  Yeah  Get right to that kilt joke  Yeah  I said but  Because I originally said  Is my asshole showing  Because I knew the minister  Might be angry  Yes  Always cater to the minister  Oh yeah  Yeah  That's why I didn't say  Does this kilt make my ass look  Yeah  What a dull wedding  That must have been  Exactly 
[01:07:00]  That was a good speech  You're the next Peggy Noonan  No  You don't know who that is  That's a fucking good reference  I do know who that is  Dr. Steve knows everything  So he knows who it is  Wait why was that  A good reference  Because she was a speech writer  For Nixon  Yeah  And she used to be  On Fox News  And she had the most  Glossy lips  Of any woman  Oh look at you  Dr. Steve likes lips  Yeah  Especially when they're glossy  He's a face fucker  He's used to seeing  The ones all dried out  With a respirator in there 
[01:07:30]  Yeah  They only went in  They only went in  For a knee injury  An hour with him  Yeah we never asked  Dr. Steve  Why are you  Why are you a doctor  For dead people  Oh my god  That doesn't make sense  Well I'm not  I'm a doctor for the living  They just happen to  Are going to die  Sooner than a lot  Of other doctors  So why do they need  A doctor  One in the grave  Another on a skateboard  But why do they need  A doctor at that point  Here's the thing  That's the one time  You don't need a doctor  Yeah a doctor  No no no no  I disagree 
[01:08:00]  If you're going  From non-life  To life  Then we have  Three different  Medical specialties  We've got neonatology  And perinatology  And we've got  OBGYN  And if you're going  From life to non-life  There's maybe  And some ministers  You know  It's ridiculous  How we give that  Second transition  Such short shrift  Do you yuck it up  With like a  Grim Reaper suit  Sometimes you walk in  With a sickle  Into the room  Just look at the beds  Watch the look  On their eyes 
[01:08:30]  Their dead  Lifeless  Fogged over eyes  I went to see a friend  Who was in the hospital  And I walked in the room  And his eyes  Got real big  And he said  Why did they consult  You on me  Oh man  Yeah you're  You're doctor death  Yeah no one wants  To see you  Oh man  That's gotta be a drag  He has a good  Graveside manner  Right  Yeah  That's his bedside manner  He walks in with a shovel  Fucking dirt on his shoes  Holy  Sorry I just saw 
[01:09:00]  You're the last patient  A cross and a bible  Are you like  The angel of death  No no no  Do you ever have  To use a pillow  I don't know  How many charts  Do you shred  He just  Ah yeah  Let me have your chart  He won't be needing this  Well we just freed up  Some space  In the file cabinet  He had a headache  I recommended  Suxtenylcholine  You know  We were thinking  About getting  A new file cabinet  We don't have to 
[01:09:30]  Worry about that  Lost three this week  Jesus  I hate your job  Suxtenylcholine reference  That was pretty good  What  What  Suxtenylcholine reference  Was that you Jim  It was  Yeah  Jim knows his  Deadly medications  I know  I know  What you need  To paralyze  A woman  Before you fuck her  Your act  Wow  Yeah  Dr. Steve  You could have  Gotten into  A different line  Right  Yeah 
[01:10:00]  Lack of motivation  On your part  I'm thinking  It's easy  Oh we lost  Another one  Yeah  That's good  For your job  That's good  For your job  How many we lose  Today  Ten  Wow  Good  You're on quota  Bringing up those beds  I think in the  In the new year  We should get you  Like a job  Where maybe  The people live longer  Well  Okay  He went into this  No he went into this one  Because  He knew that his mistakes  Wouldn't be as obvious  Yeah  Just be like  You know  Well they're close anyway  I want him to yell at me 
[01:10:30]  Not Hodges  Lymphoma  In the end  I did them a favor  They were suffering  Huh  It's unlikely  That you're going  There is that  Mental calculation  That you do  It did go through my head  That it's unlikely  I'll get sued  Yeah yeah  Not many malpractices  It's against people  That are there  Just watching  For people to die  How many people  Have you literally seen  Pass from life to death  Would you say  Oh I couldn't count it  I mean I see  I see four new 
[01:11:00]  On average  Four new consults a day  And about 15 follow ups  And then I do my office  And you know  Every one of those patients  Eventually  I mean they all come to me  Before they go  But do you  Do you literally  Are you watching them  When they're alive  And then they're dead  Sometimes  Yeah  Like if we do a withdrawal  What a ghoul  You're a ghoul  I'm going to leave that  For somebody else  Pull the strings  Pull the strings  Pull the strings  Come to Governor's this weekend  You'll see another one  Oh  Oh Richard  You're not good on the stage 
[01:11:30]  No I'm just trying  To be so full  You think he writes  On their charts  With that invisible ink  Oh god  I won't be needing this  Yeah  And when they pass  To the other side  Have you ever had to  Explain your erection  To people  I just get off on death  I don't know why  So I got to end this  Line of work  Got a legit question  For you Dr. Steve  A lot of people say  There's an afterlife  Do you see any weird shit  In the rooms  When these people go  No I've had a couple  Of patients that had  Near death experiences  Though 
[01:12:00]  But I haven't seen  Any weird shit  When people go  Except one time  Did you hang up on me  No no no  We're here  You're paranoid  For some reason  Oh jeez  I'm sorry  I wonder why  That's so weird  Myself to the hangout  But  We had a lady  In Vermont  That died  And  The monks  At the priory  Nearby  Swore that her spirit  Came through there  And set off the fire alarm  At the exact moment  That she died  That's rude on her part 
[01:12:30]  That could be a coincidence  I think  Yeah exactly  Kind of a squirrel  You should be seeing  Like spirits  Yeah because she  Drived them crazy  When she was alive  You know  She was one of those  Militant Catholics  And she drove  These monks  At the priory  Out of their minds  And she just gave  One last dig  On the way out  That was their  Interpretation  Dr. Steve  I summoned my  Dead dad one day  And the lights flickered  Sam saw it  That's true  It happened in here  Sam saw it  We mean  We're talking about  Our dead dads  And I'm like  Yeah it's all bullshit  And I said  If there's something  Going on in the afterlife 
[01:13:00]  Show us a sign  And Sam's my witness  Those fucking lights  Flickered  And to this day  I don't know  What the fuck it was  Yeah  You need electrical work  I had a weird experience  When my mom died  You know  I was sitting  On my front porch  And all of a sudden  I just saw this flash  Of every moment  That my mom and I  Had spent together  And I was like  What the hell  Is going on  And then the phone rang  Even the naughty moments  Oh  That's terrible  Wait sorry  Go ahead 
[01:13:30]  You saw all the moments  At once  I was in front of  An 8mm projector  Watching home movies  But it was strange  Wait the phone rang  After you had this flash  It was my brother  Saying that my mom  Had just died  Had she been sick  I saw everything  I saw my purse  And everything  It was bizarre  It was just one of those  Crazy  Wow  But you saw all this  Before  Hold on  Hold on  Hold on  You saw all this  Before you got the news  Officially  Yeah  That's a little odd  Had she been sick  Yes 
[01:14:00]  No  Her death  Was not unexpected  Matter of fact  Her death  Is one of the reasons  I went into hospice  Because  Oh  She's  When  She suffered  For two years  And nobody knew  What to do  And it was like  Nobody else's mom  Is going to go through  That shit  If I can help her  Wow  Look how noble  Dr. Steve is  You are a noble guy  What did she die of sir  Stomach cancer  Wow  Yeah  That's a rough one  Jesus  Jesus  We rented a house  How long would that take  To kill E-Rock  Do you think  Oh  Fucking decades

Anthony's  Worst of 2012  12  12  So far  12  12  Continues right now  Hi my name is  E-Rock  E-Rock Radio on Twitter  I'm hosting this thing  While everybody else  Is on vacation  Still to come on this program  Jim Brewer  Laszlo will be in studio  Shaquille O'Neal  Tom Hiddleston  Ricky Gervais  And Joe DeRosa  And we take an in-depth look  At Chip Chipperson  But for right now  In this segment  This started early  I believe in January 
[01:17:00]  Of this year  We had Chris Kyle in  He was promoting his book  He's an American sniper  Most  I think the most decorated sniper  In military history  And he told a little story  About punching Jesse Ventura  When he was in a bar  For Jesse being disrespectful  To the Marines  And so you know  He tells that story  And then we hear from  Our old pal Alex Jones  Who plugs his website  A million times  I'm not even going to  Go into it right now  But he has a problem  With Chris Kyle's story  Saying that it's  Bogus  Bunk if you will  To use harsh language 
[01:17:30]  And that he believes  Jesse Ventura's side  Of the story  Jesse is an honorable guy  He knows Jesse  Blah blah blah blah blah  So we get them both  On the phone  To confront each other  And this is when  Magic happens  As Chris Kyle  Talks to Alex Jones  On the worst of 2012  So far  This is Opie and Anthony's  Worst of 2012  So far  There's someone on the line  Saying that you were  In a bar fight  With Jesse Ventura  Is that true?  Oh my god  Is it?  Yes  You were?  Oh shit  Oh let's get into this 
[01:18:00]  Yeah I would like to  Did you talk about it?  I was going to ask you  How you felt about it  Because we  We  I don't know  How do you explain  There was a verbal  Altercation in here  But he used to come  On our show  And it was alright  We didn't agree  With a lot of the stuff  He said  But we had an okay time  Thank you for your service  Then we had a moment  Where he walked off  Our show  Because we just  Killed him with knowledge  We really did  A big argument  Especially Jimmy  We had a big argument  Jimmy does a good  Impression of him too  And it was just  Uncomfortable  And he was  Whatever  I wanted to ask 
[01:18:30]  How you felt about him  As a SEAL  But if you had a bar fight  Were you stressing  The difference between  When UDT  Or what happened  No  Being UDT  I fully respect that  SEALs were born  Out of UDT  So I consider him  Yes  He's a SEAL  He's part of the family  I don't draw a distinction  Between them  What happened in the bar  Yeah what happened  You were in a bar  Oh Jesus  We had just come back  From our 06 deployment  When we lost our guys  We were having a wake  For the guy  Who got the medal of honor 
[01:19:00]  Mikey Monsoor  And he happened  To be there  He was coming in  For a graduating  Buds class  That he was going  To speak to  And he was upset  With the war  He doesn't agree with it  Which is fine  You don't have to  Agree with the war  I just get sent there  I don't have to  Agree with politics  I signed up  To serve the country  The country tells me  What to do  He was making it known  That he did not  Agree with it  And I approached him  And said hey  It's not the place 
[01:19:30]  I appreciate it  But we are having a wake  It was the seal bar  There in town  I said we're having  A wake here  The family's here  I would appreciate it  If you just kind of  Keep it down  He told us that  We were killing  Innocent people over there  Men, women, children  That we were murderers  And I said you know what  We can all have  Our differences  That's fine  But please just  Don't upset the family  Yeah  And then he said  That you know  We deserve to lose  A few guys  Holy shit  Jesse said that  Yes  What the fuck  Is wrong with him  So by the way 
[01:20:00]  All you guys out there  That attacked me  Because I fucking  Attacked him  Good  I'm glad to hear that  He really is a douche  And what happened  When he said that to you  Did you grab his ponytail  No  You slugged him  Good  I punched him  I punched him  Good for you  Where'd you punch him  Bravo  In the face  What happened  That's when you take a headshot  Well I mean  Jesse Venturi  He's  A big man  He's an older guy  He's an older guy  Of course all the guys  Then started making fun of me  So what geriatric  Are you going to see him today  Yeah of course 
[01:20:30]  When you hit him  Did he hit you back  Or  No he  He went down  Oh  Like was he  I don't think he was out  It definitely took him  Off balance  He went down  But the ref wasn't looking  They never are  Did his walker  Fall with him  Yeah  I think he fell out  Of his wheelchair  He's a big dude  Wow he went down  He had a big dude  He's still Jesse the body  I mean he's an older guy  But he's still a big strong guy  Did he awkwardly get up  And have to walk out  Of the place  I don't know  I took off running 
[01:21:00]  Because the cops  Were already outside  And as soon as I hit him  I knew  Seal party  Seal bar  Cops were watching  They saw the whole thing happen  So I took off running  Oh yeah  So Jesse Ventura  Said to a seal  At a bar  Where there was a wake for a seal  You deserve to lose a few guys  You make me even happy  Because he and I  Got into a very very nasty exchange  Because I was  I was defending  Kind of  Al Qaeda  Yes  And I said  You know what  They're nice people Jesse 
[01:21:30]  No I said that  I kind of  Agreed with the Afghanistan  Action  And he was saying  That I'm just a guy  Who didn't serve  Who was for the war  And I'm like  But that's not where I'm coming from  I'm not saying  Fucks  Just go out and fight  It wasn't at all  So we just got into  An ugly thing  And it got personal  What an ass  He is  A douche  But he really hates my guts  So I'm so happy you did that  Because I'm not a man  Like I couldn't stand up  And punch him  What happened was  As we kept arguing  He patted me on the back  Hard  And I knew he was like  As he was leaving 
[01:22:00]  He's like  Thanks for your service  But it was like one of those  And for me to match him  I would have had to pat it  And I'm like  I'm not going to do what you did  I wish I was him though  How great would that have been  Just to slug him  So I insulted him  Yeah I'm sure I just caught him  Off balance and he tripped  Yeah that must have been  Sure  Good for you man  I'm so happy  This is O&A's worst of 2012  So far  On the Opie and Anthony channel  Hi Chris how are you  What's up Chris  Not much  How y'all doing  Well  You told the story  On our show  That you punched 
[01:22:30]  Jesse Ventura  In a bar  And wow  The story took off  Man  Was this the first place  You've ever told that story  Publicly  Yeah  Well yes  I mean  For a big audience  Like that  I mean  The event  Is in the book  But I purposely  Left his name out  Right  Because I didn't want  That whole thing  To take off  Like that  And then  Ever since then  I've been trying to  Kind of deflect questions  From it  Because  Not trying to make money  Off of putting him down  Or anything  Yeah  Yeah 
[01:23:00]  We got a tip  That it was Jesse Ventura  We asked you  And you decided  To say yes to that  And admit it was  Jesse Ventura  Because like you said  In the book  It's very vague  You said you punched  A guy  Fuzzy face guy  Was it  Was that the exact  Yeah  Scruffy face  Scruffy face  Right  Right  Well a lot of people  Are now calling you  A liar  Including  I believe you by the way  Yeah so do I  Yeah  So far we believe you  Absolutely  Alright  They can call me  Whatever they want  Because I know this thing 
[01:23:30]  Has gotten so blown up  That the only way  To actually put it to rest  Is  The witnesses  I have  Asked them to  Stay out of it  Where finally now  I've said  You know what  Just go ahead  Come out with it  Oh okay  Put this behind us  Oh you have actually  Asked them to speak up  Because  There was audio  We heard of Ventura  Of course  You probably heard it too  Where he's denying  Ever meeting you  And he's harping on the fact  That a crime  Has been committed  And maybe he should  File charges  Larges  Yeah 
[01:24:00]  He definitely should  If he thinks that's right  Do you regret it at all  You know what  I wish I would have  Handled it differently  I mean  I don't  I mean  The story  I think definitely  Needed to be in the book  Like it is  But as far as  Yeah I probably should have  Played it down  To where his name  Didn't get out there  But  You know what  It is now  What exactly happened Chris  If you could just refresh  Because a lot of people  Might not have heard you 
[01:24:30]  On that moment  Just if you could give us  A brief  Just kind of sum the story  So people know  What we're talking about  It was a wake  For Mikey  And of course  All the families  Were there  He was there  I started  Getting loud  And voicing his opinion  Coming out against the war  And the troops  And everything  So we asked him  To keep it down  And he got  Belligerent about it  And finally said  We deserve to lose a few 
[01:25:00]  Yeah that's  We're way over the line  Now was he  He was there  This was in a bar  Just so people know  Yes  It was the  Outside patio portion  Of a bar  And we were standing  On the sidewalk of it  Now was he with anybody  Or was he alone  To your knowledge  No I mean  He was definitely there  At the bar  With people  Oh he was with people  So there's a few people  That saw this  Oh there's a bunch  Of people that saw this  Yeah and they've  They've spoken about it  Like in smaller  Circles over the years  It's not like this 
[01:25:30]  Has been a  Complete secret  Oh no  I mean the entire  Community has known  About this  And there's a room  Like there's a radio guy  Who's friends with  Jesse Ventura  Who thinks that  We all scripted this  Together  I guess because  Opie just happened  To look over  Yeah  And at the instant  Feedback  Which is the one time  Instant feedback  Actually you know  Gave us something helpful  Actually it was a phone call  A phone call  Okay  It seemed like it  Might have been someone  That really knows  Chris Kyle  And was kind of just  You know hoping  That you were finally  Going to mention the name  But Alex Jones says 
[01:26:00]  That it's a conspiracy  We were in on the  Conspiracy  Even though we just  Met you that morning  And by the way  We thought you  Were awesome  Yeah  We think you  Oh yeah  The greatest  People loved you  On the show man  And they also  Alex Jones also says  We scripted the whole thing  So we helped you along  And we got together  And we came up  With this whole thing  Right  I've heard all those rumors  Jesse was the wrestler  He did the scripted stuff  Not  Right  Not other people  And also I love  How Chris Kyle  Is admitting  That he told us first 
[01:26:30]  Because Bill O'Reilly  Took this fucking story  And stole it from us  That cocksucker  That cocksucker  Yeah he kind of ran with it  Like he just  Whatever  Well we got  We got Alex Jones  On the line too  He wants in on this  You cool with that Chris?  Definitely  Alright  Hey Alex  Hey guys  Hey Alex  Welcome to the  Opie and Anthony show  Hey I like the show  Also like Norton  When he's on the boneyard  Thank you very much man  Don't kiss ass right now 
[01:27:00]  Well we got Alex  Don't kiss people  No no no no  Let's not kiss anyone's ass  Right now  I actually listen to that  Hey hey  I actually listen to that channel  I mean so I'm just saying  I listen to you  You're kissing a little ass  Because you know  You're in a tough spot  Right now sir  Why did you call us liars  And why did you say  That we were in on a  Conspiracy with Chris Kyle  And that we scripted this thing  Okay well number one  I'm not in a tough place  I was just trying to be friendly  I just woke up about 15 minutes  No no no  You're in a tough place  No I'm not in a tough place  Jesse Ventura lied on your show 
[01:27:30]  I want to talk about  Simplewars.com  Jesse Ventura lied on your show sir  Alex so what happened  You thought that we scripted this  With Chris Kyle  Which is ludicrous  What are you thinking there  No let me tell you  What I meant by that  I'm saying the way he was talking  You know then  Somebody calls in with it  And the way he was talking  I think it was scripted  I did not think  And did not say  That I thought  You guys were in on the lie  I was watching your face  On the video  And it looks like  You're there believing it  And hearing it for the first time  So you guys aren't even 
[01:28:00]  On the radar screen  As far as I'm concerned  With this whole deal  But I know Jesse  Pretty damn well  And see him get tears  In his eyes and stuff  When he talks to troops  In airports and stuff  I mean quite frankly  If he sees troops  He runs over  Or they run over to him  And it goes on and on  And it's the same thing  About it's the politicians  That have sent you  And it's wrong  And it's terrible  What's happening to you  And all this stuff  So when I  When I heard him  Talk about punching him  And knocking him down  I thought well  That sounds wild  But could be true 
[01:28:30]  But as soon as he  Said the thing on O'Reilly  And stuff about  Yeah he said  You deserve to die  You guys deserve to die  When the family's right there  That is made up  Period  I knew it was bull then  And guaranteed  Ventura  I've never even heard him  After I did that interview  The other day on Skype  He was like  I heard him like  Almost crying in the background  And his wife totally angry  So believe me  Ventura's not getting ready  To depose people  And go absolutely ape  Over nothing  He doesn't have  People over there 
[01:29:00]  At that McP's place  Getting  You know getting  Affidavits signed  And stuff for nothing  Totally made up  Alright listen  So you  You have no doubt  That Chris Kyle  Did not punch Jesse Ventura  No what I just said is  I was going back  To when I watched  The video  Last week  When he first says  Did Chris Kyle  Punch Jesse Ventura  Or not  Let me just stop you  Right there  Ventura denies  That it ever happened  And do you believe that  Absolutely  But what I'm telling you  Is watching the video  Knowing Ventura  Okay  Knowing him well 
[01:29:30]  I'm watching the video  And the guy's saying  You know he was talking  About the war  And punched him  I'm thinking  Well that might have happened  When he gets to the part  About yeah  He said the SEALs  Deserved to die  And when he said it  On O'Reilly  It looked really scripted  By him  He was following a script  I knew it was pure bull  And as soon as I talked  To Ventura  As soon as I could  Get a hold of him  Sure enough  He was completely dumbfounded  Alex  We've got to jump in  A little bit  Because don't forget  Chris is not a public figure  So he's not used  To speaking publicly 
[01:30:00]  So when he's talking  About things that he's  Not used to talking about  On Bill O'Reilly  A show he's probably  Watched for 10 years  Right  It might be a little bit  More nerve wracking  And we do have Chris here  To respond to that  We have to let him respond  Yeah  Chris how do you feel  We'll get to respond in court  I mean right now  Chris  Yeah  That's fine  I mean  I've got the people  That are definitely  Going to come out  And some of them  Are the family members  That were there  So I'm not too concerned  And Chris  What did he say  About the Navy SEALs  Dying  I think that that's  Being misquoted  Yeah you are misquoting it Alex 
[01:30:30]  What did he say Chris  He said you deserve  To lose a few  Deserve to lose a few  Yeah that means  Deserve to die  Well it does  What it means  And what was said  Don't try Perry Mason crap  You've been misquoting  The man the whole time  You've ever  Kyle you think  You're going to make  A big name for your  New American mercenary force  To help knock heads  Of American people  Think again  I know all about  Richard Perl  All about  Your trips to Israel  All of it buddy boy  Who is Richard Perl  What is 
[01:31:00]  Who is  Who is  Richard Perl  I'll give you that  Who is Richard Perl  Yeah it'll all come out  And by the way Alex  We're not giving you  Who is Richard Perl  And we're also not giving you  Perry Mason stuff  And playing semantics games  The difference  To me it's more believable  For Jesse Ventura  To say  You guys deserve  To lose a few  Than to say something  As harsh  Right  As I'm glad  Navy SEALs are dying  Exactly  There is a difference  In believability  In what one guy would say  And I don't think  Jesse Ventura  Would come out  And go  I'm glad a soldier's dead  That's the same thing 
[01:31:30]  And that's how  No it's not  That he was  That he's saying  The Navy SEALs  Deserve to lose a few  That is saying  Lose a few means die  It absolutely does  But there is a difference  In the way you say it  What is more believable  To me  Listen I hope for you  Your sake  That you are telling the truth  And you know  I mean Ventura  Is so freaked out by this  He's saying  You know  Do they have a body  Double of me  Or something  I talked to him  That's paranoia  He is completely  He is completely  Flummoxed  And dumbfounded 
[01:32:00]  I'm flummoxed  And dumbfounded  Chris  Chris were you tempted  To put Jesse's name  In the book  Because Alex  One thing that makes  This more believable  To me  Is that Chris did not  Put the name  Put the name  In the book  The publisher probably  Said he couldn't prove it  The publisher  Now Chris Kyle  Is saying today  Alex  That he can prove this  And a lot of the guys  That know about this  He finally told them  Yeah you could  Tell everyone  What you saw that day  Okay well that's not  What the owner  Of the bar  Is going to say  Now Chris  Why didn't you 
[01:32:30]  Put it in the book  Honestly  Because I didn't want  This whole reaction  To come out here  Yeah see  I'm not trying to  Sell my book  Off of making  Someone else look bad  And Alex  Is it possible  Because we heard you  Calling Chris  You called it  The turkey shoot  Is it possible  That your agenda  Look you don't like  The war  It's common knowledge  And you love Jesse  Isn't it possible  That your agenda  Is skewing  The way you're  Looking at this  Well yeah  I mean we all  See through  Rose colored glasses  And you know  I'm a Texan 
[01:33:00]  You know  I mean I'm sure  Kyle at some point  Is a friendly guy  My whole issue here  Is when I say  Turkey shoot  Not that I follow  Too much of this  Military stuff  But I love  Families in the military  And of course  There's the big joke  About you know  The Hadjis  Don't know how  To aim a gun  My god  You know  There were people  There who couldn't  Believe the kill  Numbers everybody  Was getting  And when you're  Shooting women  Running around  With hangar nades  And you're shooting  I mean  Plus there's all  The contractor footage  Of them playing  Elvis music 
[01:33:30]  And shooting whole  Families out of  Their cars  And then dropping  AK-47s on them  I mean that's the  Big joke  Every armored vehicle  And Kyle knows this  It's full of  Drop guns  And they splatter  A whole bunch of  People at a  Checkpoint or whatever  Dropping AK-47 on them  You all get  You know  Bronze stars for  Kills in combat  I'm not saying  That's exactly  What Kyle did  But it's all  Well known  About Iraq  The Iranian war  Start  Yeah you were  Over there  You must have  Seen it  Kyle how do you  Respond to that  You gotta let  Kyle respond  You can't make  An accusation like  That and not let  Kyle respond 
[01:34:00]  He's gotta respond  Kyle  Chris I'm sorry  No problem  We've never had  Drop weapons on us  But I can tell you  As far as the book  It's not sitting there  Trying to glorify  All the people I've killed  It's trying to get across  The sacrifices that a  Military member has to  Go through while he's  Overseas and at the  Same time my wife is  Telling the sacrifices  She went through while  Here at home and I'm  Trying to highlight the  Heroes that surrounded me  That made me look good  And all through the book  I downplay myself  And one thing you said  Chris too when you were 
[01:34:30]  On is that people were  Trying to inflate the  Number to two something  And Alex you didn't  Hear the interview but  Chris kept going on  And I'm happy with it  This is fine like I  Don't need any more  Numbers attributed to me  He was downplaying  Everything that day  And on your show  Let me be clear I think  In war a sniper is an  Honorable position people  Always try to you know  Make it look bad I've  Interviewed a lot of  Snipers like Colonel  Craig Roberts and  Others we did in  Vietnam and I'm not  Downplaying that you know  That Chris can't shoot  A gnat off a fence  Post a thousand yards I'm 
[01:35:00]  Simply saying that it's  Well known just like  With the army helicopter  Shooting up the  Reuters van that as far  As turkey shoot goes there  Were times when you just  Have all sorts of mayhem  And people being blasted  In all directions and it's  A lot easier to be a  Sniper in the desert or in  Those built up mount  Areas than it was in  Say southeast Asia I mean  That's my point about  Turkey shoot clearly Kyle  Would it have been harder  To make thousand yard  Two thousand yard shots  In Vietnam in the jungle 
[01:35:30]  Or from a rooftop  Into a desert  Oh I am not claiming my  Wars any harder than  Vietnam and I give the  Vietnam vets all the  Profs because they  Definitely fought a  Harder war and I give  Carlos Halfcock all the  Credit as being the  Greatest sniper to have  Ever lived  And you and Alex  That's all I was  Saying guys  Okay something you  Said too which I  Thought was a little  Unfair but you said  That Chris is bragging  About shooting women  And the way you  Painted that and we  Played the audio was  That here is this here  Is this uh guy going 
[01:36:00]  Over to Iraq and he's  Coming back acting like  He's hot shit for  Killing women but when  Chris described that  Shoot he was really  Specific he was bothered  By it  About being bothered  I read quotes and in  Fairness the media does  Take things out of  Context where it's  Talking about  No you you take  Things out of context  Because you made it  Sound like he was  Bragging about shooting  Women but he didn't  Bragging if you listen  To the actual interview  And not transcripts you  Would have you would  Have heard Chris Kyle  Being very bothered by  The fact that he shot  A woman to watch the  Entire interview all I 
[01:36:30]  Saw was like a three  Minute clip on the  Internet no we  Understand that but  We're saying was when  You're quoting something  And you're and you're  Painting this guy there's  A big difference there you  Were painting him as this  Cavalier ass who was  Bragging about shooting a  Woman and what he was  Telling us Chris I think  Is that you made  Absolutely sure she had  A grenade you could see  It through your scope you  Were being told yes you  Have to take her out  Because she's walking  Towards marines like he  Saved us soldiers lives  But the way you painted  All I'm saying is this  Even the Dallas morning  News said there's  Something creepy and I'm 
[01:37:00]  Not even saying this about  Kyle about about on TV  Constantly you know especially  The host and people  Smacking their lips but and  Maybe that's where I'm  Picking this up you guys  Didn't really do that but  Some of the other shows  Getting all excited you  Go tell us more about  Killing the people tell us  More and it's just at a  Certain point it's it's  Disgusting and I don't  Want to hear about it and  And I'm not saying Kyle's  Even bad for that it's true  When I've now that I've  Seen more of the  Interviews with him he's  Not the one getting off on  It some of the hosts are 
[01:37:30]  And I just know all the  People I know from  Vietnam World War two  And places will never  Even talk about it so I'm  Just saying hearing all of  This stuff I mean I  Remember one time I  Was at the deer camp I  Was about 10 years old  For all these old World  War two vets there in  Buffalo Texas you know  Just south of Dallas  Where we've got a ranch  And I know you know  Kyle's from that you  Know general area and  I'm sitting there pulling  On their leg at 5 a.m.  While they're you know  Cooking business and  Gray before we go hunting  Tell me a war story tell  Me a war story tell me a  War story and and uh uh  One old guy who was a 
[01:38:00]  Tank commander going into  Germany said okay there  Was this woman looked like  Marilyn Monroe uh walked up  And uh opened up her  Trench coat and pulled out  A rifle so we cut her in  Half now there's your  Story don't ask me anymore  I understand that war is  Ugly I've got all that  Stuff all I know is I  Don't believe that Jesse  Ventura said you deserve  To lose a few and unless  He was drunk and the  Problem is Jesse hasn't  Had alcohol like 15 years  Because of blood clots he  Has to take medicine for  Blood clots and I know 
[01:38:30]  Kyle's saying that you  Know that I've seen him  On O'Reilly that he  Wasn't drinking all I know  Is that the Jesse Ventura  I know does not talk  About and uh the troops  It always says I mean  It's a line you know he  Says the same stuff over  And over again that the  Troops are heroes it's  Not their fault it's the  Military you know it's  The politicians fault for  Failing and sending them  There and lying about  WMDs and and so when  Chris says that I mean  And again right now he  Sounds like a nice guy so  I'm completely blown away 
[01:39:00]  By this because Ventura  Sounds credible you know  Kyle you know uh you  Know right now sounds  Calm and nice and I mean  I don't know what kind  Of side office is or what  This is but let me just  Tell you it's a big deal  Well well okay we do  Have a problem because  Uh Chris Kyle saying it  Happened and Jesse Ventura  Saying it didn't happen  Yeah exactly and we heard  Some audio of you and you  Said that you don't even  Believe Jesse Ventura was  In the bar that day because  He doesn't drink well yeah 
[01:39:30]  That was probably been like  Last Thursday or Friday  Before I talked to Jesse  And then Jesse says yes I  Was there for graduation but  I wasn't there speaking it  Was something about numbers  That are the same as another  Class um yeah we heard that  Part so you think Chris  Kyle's lying I don't believe  That Jesse Ventura said you  Deserve to lose a few no no  No no all right fair enough but  Do you think Chris Kyle  Punched Jesse Ventura and  Knocked him down I told you that 
[01:40:00]  When I first was sitting  There you know they come in  During a break when I was  On the radio like last  Thursday and they said have  You seen this you know uh  From the LB and Anthony  Show and I said no seen one  They said here it is they  Pulled it up on screen and  I started watching it and he  Says you know he was in  There talking about about the  War blah blah blah and I  Thought oh well maybe there  Was a fight and then when he  Gets the part about you know  You deserve to lose a few I  Was like that's a bunch of  Bull and so that that was my  Initial response uh is that is 
[01:40:30]  Is that I can imagine Jesse  Ventura you know sometime  Making somebody angry talking  Bad about the war and some  Type of altercation ensuing but  The part about him saying that  I cannot see that happening and  Now that Jesse denied it I have  To believe Jesse and let me tell  You Jesse's so shocked that  Other Navy SEAL would say  Something like this because he  Thinks they're all honorable that  You know off air well he even  Said some of it on air he's  Like my god Alex do you think  Like like they had a double in 
[01:41:00]  There this is some type of  Psy-off  Now hold on Chris  Now Chris um is it possible  That you and Jesse were  Arguing or you were debating and  He said something to the effect  Of it's only natural you're  Going to lose a few or you are  100% sure that he said it and  With the intention that you  Heard it  No I feel the opinion that he  Said exactly what I thought he  Heard some other guys that  Were standing right there  Oh they heard it as well  And I feel horrible about it 
[01:41:30]  Coming out the way it had and  I'm sorry I handled it the way  I did on your show I I guess I  Should have just denied it and  Said I don't know what you're  Talking about and I had no idea  And after all this has come out  I've listened to different  Interviews of people trying to  You know say I'm lying and  Everything I had no idea and  Mr. Ventura is trying to was  Thinking about public office  Doing all this other stuff I  Honestly have no idea who this  Pearl guy is so no I'm not  Part of some bigger thing  Trying to discredit him and  Yeah I feel bad that now all 
[01:42:00]  Of a sudden all this attention  Is on this and I'm trying to  Get a story out there about  Hey y'all look at what the  Troops have to go through and  Take notice and let's take  Care of these  Well can I ask you a question  Definitely  You're setting up craft and you  Say you're going to have  Basically diplomatic protection  Training of law enforcement all  These groups you've gotten awards  From different international  Groups I know you'd be here or I'd  Pull it up and I mean have you  Gone to Israel and gotten police 
[01:42:30]  Training no sir so so so so so you  Haven't gotten awards from that  American slash Israel group that  Trains domestic U.S. police  Well I got a GENSA award Jewish  Institute for National Security  Affairs that's while I was still  Active that was in 05 yeah well  Just so you know that's Richard  Pearl and he's known as the  Prince of Darkness in the  Pentagon that's his nickname but  Let's just expand on that for a 
[01:43:00]  Moment do you know about the  National Defense Authorization Act  And how Congress just abolished  The posse commentatus act I  Mean you're a you're a a what  Master sergeant isn't it no sir  I was a chief chief okay chief a  Chief sergeant I forget all these  Different titles and names I mean  Certainly you know what posse  Commentatus is what sir  Honestly as far as when it comes  To that I have my business  Partners because my my main  Concern is running the training  Side of the business I understand  What is posse commentatus I 
[01:43:30]  I don't know what it is I'm  Pretty sure I've caught it twice  It means no worries for the rest  Of your days shut up Norton and  Play what I don't know I don't  Know what posse commentatus means  Oh okay that's the 1878 law  Barring the military from domestic  Law enforcement okay and and and  Kyle I mean I'm just curious here I  Mean this is this sniper training and  Stuff I mean I mean that's basically  Paramilitary training for the police  But I know they've had snipers  Before that I'm just saying I see a 
[01:44:00]  Lot of data points here and I was  Thinking maybe somebody had maybe  You had been in an altercation with  Some big guy look like Ventura maybe  Somebody told you that was Ventura  Maybe somebody put you up to talking  About this but you know listening to  You know you sounded you sound  Dumbfounded so I I'm dumbfounded you  Know I think that leave the founded  Part off yeah yeah is it Alex I mean  Is Jesse really that important in the  End that we have to take that take  Out Jesse Ventura and discredit him 
[01:44:30]  Okay well here's why Jesse's a question  I don't know okay here's something I  Know isn't true a 100% because I  Probably talk to Jesse every few weeks  Or something or he gives me a call  Ask me about news or just get  Ambien but but my point is I talked  Like two weeks ago I called Jesse and I  Say when are you leaving the US are you  Going to be driving through Texas you  Know you are in your RV stop by my  House and and he's like well I think  I'm leaving you know in about a week  Or so and he said but let me call you  The next few days and I'll come on the 
[01:45:00]  Radio before I leave town I said great  Say hi to your wife bye next day phone  Rings while I'm on air Jesse Ventura  Has got some breaking news he wants to  Come on now I've just called him in  Minnesota talk to him what happened  You know his wife got him off the  Elliptical machine I know he's in  Minnesota and it's all over TMZ Fox  News that Jesse Ventura is  Rubbernecking recklessly driving in  California trying to get the airport  Well Jesse has it flown in 16 months  Anyway so Jesse saying this is crazy  I think this is some dirty trick 
[01:45:30]  Saying I'm you know tailgating being  Pulled over by police I'm here in  Minnesota so he had to threaten TMZ to  Retract it so first you have that false  Story come out Fox runs with it and  Then and then this other story comes  Out and I'm telling you if Jesse is  Lying he is he is a better liar than  Even Herman Cain if he's lying he's  He's one of the best liars I've ever  Seen so that's that means you're saying  Chris Kyle's lying Chris there's no doubt  In your mind that you punched Jesse  Ventura that day right yes sir  Definitely and mr. West you're a friend 
[01:46:00]  Of mr. Ventura's I'd be more than happy  If you would like to set up a time for  Me and him not on the air me and him to  Be able to talk whether on the phone or in  Person I'll be in California next or this  Week in Vegas the week after I'll be more  And happy to sit down me and him talk and  Settle this thing wow that would be a  Newsworthy event well why why even make  It on the news I mean yeah I'm trying to  Yeah Alex what's wrong with you on this he  Wants this thing to go away I fully a 
[01:46:30]  Hundred percent believe I'm telling the  Truth you believe him I think him and I  Could definitely clear the air on this  Sure well well then I'll tell you what  I'll do if you can get me your number or  Your email I'll I'll give it to Jesse and I  Know he's got  Whoa how about we do it on our show  Well no I mean I'm not even thinking  Whoa what happened here he doesn't want to  Do it on any show how about we do a joint  Venture mr. Alex Jones if you want to get 
[01:47:00]  Them both on together that's fine we bring  You we bring you Chris Kyle you bring us  Jesse let's do this that's fair okay I  Just don't think you're in a cage what I'm  Just trying to keep it from the public  Right right Chris doesn't want it Chris  Doesn't want a three-ring circus  Hold on Alex what Chris do you have do  You have audio Skype because the only  Thing that works from where he's at the  Baja is is is audio Skype to Skype  There's no phone lines nothing so I can  I mean look I'll just I'll just send  Jesse an email and then I'll see if I 
[01:47:30]  Give you his Skype ID I just need some  Way to give that to mr. Kyle I will do  I have Skype we'll get it done off air  That's you don't want to give it on the  Air we'll do it off air that's easy we'll  Just yeah one more just stay on hold  When we finish and talk to our one more  Question for Alex Jones I don't I don't  See the upside of Chris Kyle telling the  Story considering his his career in the  Military and considering his his new  Business there why would it why would he  Take this chance and put this crazy lie 
[01:48:00]  Out there look all I know is this his  Book was already getting quite a bit of  Attention but I mean he got like three or  Four times the attention and and of  Course it did kind of distract in a way  But yeah it did get a ton of attention  Out of this yeah it sold a lot of books  We know that but in the end you know  Okay you sell a lot of books but you  Destroy your your military career well I  Know this that is what's happening as  I've looked at the different seal  Websites and stuff they're all mad that  And saying even if this is true and  They're all said they didn't hear of it 
[01:48:30]  Happening and they think they would have  That this makes it look like seals are  All talking crap about each other and it  Just makes the seals I mean even if you  Believe Ventura said that it makes it  Horrible that he'd say lose some and it  Makes it horrible that Chris Kyle would  Talk about it but as I can tell by the  You're talking this Chris Chris is not  The way you thought like you  Originally might have interpreted him  And I think that you're seeing he's a  Lot more of a real and believable guy  Yeah I mean I mean the clips I've seen  Especially on your show I mean he came  Off as kind of scripted on O'Reilly and 
[01:49:00]  I see what you're saying is he probably  Was nervous and so was just thinking  About what he was gonna say and because  I mean I'm in the media so much so are  You guys you almost forget you're even  On air it's like an opposite problem you  Forget you're on air I mean I wish I got  Butterflies like I did 16 years ago  And then at the same time when I saw  Him on your show he just seemed kind of  Like smirky and arrogant and you know  Like it was real funny and now he  Doesn't sound like that so I mean it  Does sound different Alex Alex could you

[01:54:30]  In there but for now our old friend  Long time friend Jim Brewer every time  This guy is on the show it is gold he's  Got amazing stories he's got a million  Stories that we that we've never heard  We has a million stories that he's  Told us already this is one of them  About when he rented a house had his  Whole family a bunch of friends come  Down I believe it was on the outer  Banks he rented this house had a big  Party and somebody did something and  Burnt the place down I can't really do  This story justice Jim Brewer is here he 
[01:55:00]  Will tell you everything he's at Jim Brewer  On Twitter so if you want to say hi feel  Free to do so on the worst of 2012 so far  Opie and Anthony's worst of 2012 so far  That house burning down story from the  Outer Banks that was great I almost  Burnt down the entire Outer Banks oh man  Can you tell do you do you mind not at  All because I was howling this is great  Long Island South Shore white trash heading  To another state and haven't been out in a 
[01:55:30]  While every every year for like two years  In a row I would rent two houses down on the  Outer Banks and I'd rent it so far I'd rent  As far north as possible so you have to go on  The Outer Banks and then drive on the beach  The 4x4 beach that's where I get my house  Every summer because I have so many heavy  Drinkers in my family I didn't need them  Driving around in North Carolina all night  Right so we would go at the far north end 
[01:56:00]  Of the beach where the fence was to get into  Virginia it's at the actual border right there I was at the  So I have two houses and there's nobody near me so  They didn't get as loud as they want matter of fact the first night now we had the kid house  And we have the do whatever you want house  Of all people everyone in the do whatever you want house is usually 50 and over 
[01:56:30]  Right  They don't even get off there I don't think any of my sisters saw the beach that week  Oh really?  I swear to God  The beach is literally right in front of you  It's 40 yards it's in front it's wild horses there  Both my sisters never even stood up  They just yearned  Cut a urine hole on a bench  Peed drank jugs of wine smoked 4,000  My one sister's married to the big thick German 
[01:57:00]  He'd start drinking Heineken at nine with the eggs  And so the first night we go to bed and it's like 11 o'clock at night  And for down there that's about 4 a.m.  11 o'clock at night is 4 a.m.  Because you start early you drink all day  You go swimming you see dolphins horses  It's a big long day  So the end of the night I hear like this music  Like what is going on 
[01:57:30]  I look in the next house and there's these guys playing guitar  I know no one in my family plays instruments  Like who's at their house playing guitars  These fucking yo-yos were so loud  The locals were like  Hey man someone's having a big party  And they came out of the woods  Now you gotta see the locals down there  Oh man  This is where convicts live  The houses right next to the ocean are fucking beautiful elevators 
[01:58:00]  Pools you name it  But you go in the back woods  Which is right there toward the bay area  And it's fucking  They're convicts  I'm convinced they're like making moonshine  Oh without a doubt  And all sorts of shit back there  And there's slavery still going on deep in the woods there  Without a doubt hands down  Something's going on  So anyway before we  It's locals  It's just partying our brains off  Now before we get there  I usually rent a week with my family  And then a week before that  I get my friends from Long Island 
[01:58:30]  So why don't we go there  Before my family comes  Now it's 4th of July week  So as we're going down  We stop in Virginia  Oh yeah  And I think we must have dropped  I'm not even exaggerating  Probably a thousand dollars  That's a lot  Easy  For south of the border  Easy  Thousand dollars in fireworks  Now  We get to North Carolina  We're all hopped up for  We haven't had a display like this 
[01:59:00]  Since 1978's block party  Jefferson Avenue  The big fire walk off  This was a huge event  There's no trees to interrupt  This is great  Perfect  Now whenever you go down there  Have you ever been down there  4th of July?  No  No I always go in August  It's better than the Hudson River  Yeah  And it's all local  Shooting these things  All over the water  So it clearly says everywhere  Don't even  Every sign 
[01:59:30]  Every choice  Don't even  Listen  Don't even think about  Shooting your goddamn fireworks off  We will arrest you  It is a federal offense  Don't shoot your goddamn fireworks off  Down here  And they must stay on the ground  No aerials  Well  Of course  Now we start  We wait for night  We can't even wait for night  Now we figured  Before  Before  Now  We were afraid of getting caught 
[02:00:00]  So we went  On the  On the local street  Now the local street  On the beach  Is all sand  So it's impossible  If someone called the cops on you  It's gonna take 20 minutes  For them to show up  So we got this plan  There's no way  Anyone's gonna catch us  This is gonna be phenomenal  So we go in front of the house  Where it's just all sand  There's no real roads  And we're lighting off the fireworks  And we're having a fucking hook  Core scar  It's great  Beyond  We're wasted on wine 
[02:00:30]  We're blasted  Shots  We're having  We're having a great time  Bringing back the buzz of 79  The buzz of 79  We're going back to 1979  In Rosedale  Behind the bowling alley  It's the great buzz of 79  We haven't had this much fun  Once we stole wine coolers  From the Chinamen  So we're  We're hooting up 
[02:01:00]  We're shooting off fireworks  Can't believe how great this is now  It's a great time  Yeah  We're like let's save some  Let's save the biggie biggies  For the beach  So  We take them all up  And we leave them  And we basically just cover up  Now the wives come  Mostly mine  And she's like  You can't leave the fireworks  Out  And trash down on the street  You should put them in the garbage  It's  We'll put them in the garbage  But they're hot 
[02:01:30]  We don't want to put them in  We don't want to  Well just put sand in them  Oh no  So we take the firework garbage  We put them in the garbage pails  And we throw some sand on them  We're buzzed  So it's probably not as much  As we should  So now we head to the  Now we go to the beach side  And we're lighting the big ones off  The ones where you need the  The pipes  The shit  The tubes  Sure enough  I love those 
[02:02:00]  What a great sound that is  Yeah  It's great man  Oh  Yeah  Holy shit  Umbrella  Umbrella  That one looked like  It was gonna land on us  That's like army shit  That's right  It echoes down the beach  Oh yeah  So  We see  The cops coming  Oh shit  But again  It's like ocean water 
[02:02:30]  200  They're so far down the beach  We're watching them  As we're hiding the fireworks  And we're taking the fireworks  And we're putting them under the stairs  There's little stairs  That lead to your house  We're putting them under there  And we're burying some  We're throwing others in the garbage  We still see them coming  Sure enough  And we figured  Eh  We'll pretend we're caught  With some fireworks  You know  Yeah  So he stops  And he goes  Alright  I need ID 
[02:03:00]  From all of you  So  Whatever  We're taking out the ID  He goes  Now  I'll have you know  You're gonna tell me  Where the fireworks are  Cause I clearly saw you  Lighting them up  Or I'm taking each  And every one of you  To jail  I instantly panic  And I'm like  Listen man  And before I can even finish my sense  I have to say  My friend Larry  He works at FedEx 
[02:03:30]  He's blue car  He's like  Listen bro  I don't know what you're looking for  But we ain't got it  You're coming up negative here bro  You're coming up here negative  You got nothing right here  You might as well put your pen away  Cause you ain't writing a report  I don't know what you're saying  So we all know that guy  I know that guy  We all know that guy  I know that guy  And he's got his own sayings  He's telling the guy  He's like  Bro  Negative  I don't know what you're saying  He's coming up negative  Puts the pen away

[02:04:30]  We're not telling him  We're staying right here  Alright  So he starts looking around  We're all figuring out  Where we're gonna dart  And how  Cause if he sees one  Cause if he sees one  There's six of us  He's fat  There's no way  He's outrun us  In the sand  Can I ask you  How long ago this was  I'm gonna say  Five years  So you're  Well into adulthood here  Oh yeah  This is a story  You're doing  You're 19  Jim  I've got three kids 
[02:05:00]  Sleeping in the house  I've got my baby  Sleeping in the house  It's okay  Just wanted to  No  So with that  He finally drives away  He's like  I'm telling him  If I catch you  I'm gonna find out  What house you're in  He's like  Bro  I'll clean you  We're all clean  We just told you  We're all clean  We're not like that  So he drives away  Now  We're laughing  We're enjoying  How we just 
[02:05:30]  Got out of it  Got out of the southern police  Now the homes there  Have three layers  It's literally like  A Tony Montana house  Just gorgeous  And we're looking  Over the beach  Now my blue collar  Friend Larry  His wife was pregnant  Thank God  There's a reason  Why I say she's pregnant  We're all winding it up  Buzzed  Joy in life  She comes  Out of the house  She goes  I'm really tired 
[02:06:00]  My feet are swollen  I'm getting cramps  I'm back  I'm going to bed  She comes back out  About  Three minutes later  Very calmly  Guys  There's a  Really really bad fire  In the front of the house  Oh shit  Really really bad fire  But that's how she said it  And of course  We're like  Yeah  My one friend's got the  You know  Hey hey hey hey 
[02:06:30]  He's got the pipe  It's great  The fire helps  The earth and the water  So  She goes back in  She goes  No  Guys  You really have to do  Something about this fire  And she's holding her belly  While she's saying this  She goes  It's a bad fire  I'm not kidding  It's a bad fire  So as you say that  I swear to god  In like slow motion  I just kind of look up  And as I'm getting up  I see a glare  Coming over the top of the house  Oh shit  And I get up 
[02:07:00]  Now this is from the third level  Of the house  And I turn  And through the living room  And through the kitchen window  I can see the top of a flame  Oh man  Holy shit  And I'm looking  That's 20 feet high  Easy  Easy  And I'm looking  20 foot flames  And we all go right in the front  Yeah  And you see  Oh no  This fucking thing's about  20 feet high  And 8 to 10 feet wide  And it's in the front  Of the house  Oh my god 
[02:07:30]  Now it's August  So everything is literally  Like a matchstick  Everything can burn  There's no  So we go running outside  Now we go running outside  We're literally like dogs  We're trying to  We're trying to  Throw the sand  On the thing  Like you got that section  And we're taking our shoes  And we're scooping sand up  And throwing it all over  The girls are taking buckets  And they're running to the pool  And coming back with buckets 
[02:08:00]  Bucket brigade  Now you gotta remember too  All this is in the sand  So when you run the house  It's a good 100 feet  Oh shit  So by the time they come back  The bucket's half full  They're out of breath  They need help to come and get them  For the relay race  Now the locals are out there  And they're like  You better call the fire department  It's gonna spread to the rest of the island  And as they're saying that  You literally  I swear to god  You'd see one little spark  Come floating off the tree 
[02:08:30]  Oh man  And go maybe like 8 feet  And the minute it lands  Start up  And this thing's heading  For the next house  And it's heading  For our cars  So I'm gonna say  We got it about  60%  Under control  60%  I'm fired about it  Yeah we got about  60%  Under control  We're hoping  By the end of the day  We can really get a  Bite onto this thing 
[02:09:00]  60%  Oh man  So I'm all worried  About the cars  We start getting the cars  And we're moving the cars  So the cars don't blow up  But it's heading  For the other house  That's what I'm starting  To freak out about  Oh man  And so  Now we got a hose  Another guy comes out  With a hose  We'll hose it down  65%  Under control  Now  The fire department  Comes  They put it out  Really quick  We have to fill out  A report  Oh yeah  Oh boy

[02:11:00]  And he's  Before he gets out  He's in the car  And I'm going  Oh my god  He's just looking  All the damage  We're in a lot  Of trouble  This is really bad  He's been in the car  For like ten minutes  He gets out of the car  He looks  At the direction  Of all the bushes  Where the garbage pails  Used to be  He comes walking  Up the stairs  I open the door  And uh  He goes  Hello 
[02:11:30]  I'm from the  I know  I know  I know  This is bad  He goes  I apologize  I go  You apologize  He goes  I would have  Got here sooner  Cause um  I'm here about  The kitchen drawer  Your wife called  The kitchen drawers  Jammed  So I'm looking at  And I'm like  All awkward  And I'm not sure  If he's toying with me  Right right right  So I said uh  Yeah  Yeah motherfucker  Yeah let me show you  Let me show you that

[02:12:30]  With the grease  Or something  It's no problem  He goes  Is there anything else  I go  No sir  He goes back in the car  And he leaves  So now we know  Alright  Here's what we gotta do  We go to town  We bought all new garbage pails  And green  Spray paint  And we spray painted  All the bushes  And the trees  I swear to god  Green and brown  Everything  Had no leaves and nothing  But we painted it all 
[02:13:00]  And we had brown  And we were spray painting  The sand  So  And we spray painted  Everything  As if it was back to normal  And we never  But we came that close  To burning down  All the outer banks  Dude  That's fucking insane  Three separate fires  Dude it was  It was bad news  That one  That was  The one in the front  When the firemen came  What was actually burning  In the front  What happened was  The fireworks 
[02:13:30]  The fireworks  In the garbage pail  Right  Started a fire  In the garbage pail  Oh shit  And then that thing  Completely disintegrated  And they put it on crates  Wooden crates  Oh so that shit went up  So then the crate went up  And then that lit up  The bushes and the trees  And everything else  And once the embers start going  It's over  And this had to have been  A period of a good  Two and a half hours  Wow  Between  Putting those fireworks in there  And then going  And catching another buzz  And dealing with the cops  And then sitting  And relaxing  Enjoying the night  All that shit and everything  Just brewing  Right 
[02:14:00]  The fire's just  Just fucking  Percolating  Yeah well you guys  Go enjoy the fright  We're gonna percolate here  Your friend  Couldn't wait for the perfect opportunity  To just  Burst into flames  Wow man  Thank god somebody saw it  Cause you motherfuckers  Just partying  If she wasn't pregnant  Yeah  And  She would've been down there  To go to bed  To go to bed  Right  That place would've been  Lit up  And I would've been  In the news  For the wrong reasons  Oh yeah 
[02:14:30]  I don't know  Comedian  Jim Brewer  Carly involved  In a  Huge fire  Formerly  Go to  No here's what  It would've been like  Half baked  Sets a baking blaze  That's it  Perfect  A full baked  Fully baked  Blaze  In North Carolina  By the  I'm not high  Jim Brewer  That's good  Arsonist  Jim Brewer  Yeah  This is 
[02:15:00]  Opie and Anthony's  Worst of 2012  So far  So far  Um  So far  Hey it's E-Rock  I'm hosting this thing  Still to come on the program  That we call  The worst of 2012  So far  For the Opie and Anthony show  Did I say show or show  I don't know what I just said  Shaquille O'Neal  Will still be coming up  In a little bit  Tom Hiddleston  He's Loki on the Avengers  Ricky Gervais and Joe DeRosa  Answer some questions  About trannies  And Chip Chipperson  Cause who doesn't love Chip  Everybody  But we gotta fit some of that in here 
[02:15:30]  But for right now  Laszlo's in studio  Laszlo works for the video game company  Rockstar Games  He's in promoting Max Payne 3  Which is out right now  You should definitely go get it  It is a  It's an incredible game  But he talks about  Some of his world travels  About where he's been  What he's done  In this particular story  He talks about going down  To Brazil  To map out  The land  The language  The people's actions  All that stuff  To put into the video game  And talks about  The madness  That he had to deal with  As far as security 
[02:16:00]  Guns and drugs  And all this other stuff  In order to get  All this stuff  And cram it into  A great game  Max Payne 3  On Rockstar Games  Available right now  They did not pay me  For that plug  I'm just hoping to get  A voice in the next game  On Rockstar  Worst of 2012  At the end of World War 2  A lot of Germans  Got the fuck out of Dodge  And went to Brazil  Went to Sao Paulo  Yeah  Nazis  And just you know  Your standard German people  What's the difference 
[02:16:30]  Between the two cities?  Well  Sao Paulo is more the capital  And sort of the  You know  The main  Place of business  There's only 24 million people  That's a big fucking city  The third largest city  In the world  And when we were  Flying into it  It's just  You know in New York City  Where you have  Really tall buildings  And then the farther  You go out  The buildings get  Smaller and smaller  There it's just  Big buildings  Everywhere  Really?  And there's no  Zoning laws  So you'll have like  Holy shit  Is this it?  Yes  So you'll have 
[02:17:00]  That's like SimCity  Gone mad  Holy fuck  That's when you're  Playing SimCity  And you finally go  Ah fuck it  I'm turning the computer off  I've played enough  An enormous  Enormous rich building  Because the  The amount of money  In that city  Is unbelievable  And the amount of poverty  Is equally as insane  You'll have a  This razor wired  Super complex  And right next door  Are favelas  And people making homes  Out of like  Pieces of construction debris  It was unbelievable 
[02:17:30]  Now what about  Did you feel safe there?  Because in Brazil  You got  It's like  They are so poor  You have people  Always begging you for money  And there's always  This really weird  Possible danger  Well we  When we flew in  We were instructed  To get a bulletproof car  Really?  Yeah  Because I had  About 10 grand  Worth of cash on me  Because  We went down there  To record  For Max Payne 3  And we've been  Going down to Brazil  Why do you have to  Go down there  To do that?  Well  A lot of video games  When they're set 
[02:18:00]  In a foreign location  When you're  Running around  Fighting enemies  All of the bad guys  Speak in like  Broken English  My favorite ones  Are the military ones  Where they're like  You know  He's coming  Comrade  It's like  Why  If we're in a gun battle  Why are you speaking  English  So I can understand  I'm reloading  Cover me  You know  It's like  And it's all these  These terrible  Accents  And it sounds  So cartoony  So  Since Max Payne 3  Is set in Sao Paulo  We went down there  And recorded  A bunch of people 
[02:18:30]  Dozens and dozens  Of people  So that  How do you  Oh you record them  In a studio  Yeah record them  In a studio  I didn't know  They're giving you  A good recording  Well because we have  Translators there  You know  With us  But  So that when you're  Playing the game  That there's authentic  You know  Portuguese being screamed  At you  While the guys  Trying to shoot you  In the face  Now do you  Now that  They'll buy that game  There right  Will that game  Sell well in Brazil  You think  Hope so  Do other games  Sell well there  Well  You know  Central and South America  Have a huge 
[02:19:00]  I have a huge  Piracy issue  Because video games  Video games  And you talk about  Taxes  Video games in Brazil  A game here  That costs $60  Costs about $110  There  Wow  Because if it's not  Manufactured in the  Country  They slap a huge  Tax on it  And that's  And it's  Actually in a weird  Way it's very smart  Yeah we should do that  I have to tell you  If you want to make  A like we were  Riding around  Later on in this  You know  Ford car or whatever  It's made in Brazil 
[02:19:30]  And so all these  Companies if you want  To sell to the  Third largest city  In the world  And plus you know  All the other  I mean it's a  Massive country  Open a plant right  You got to open a  Plant and it  Creates jobs  And you know  I started thinking  Like about all the  Horseshit that we  Just bring over  From overseas  Yeah  I was like you know  Maybe that's what  We should do  Tax the shit  Out of China  Tax it really high  And then fuck  Tax it high  Coming to Trump  Said something like  That 25% tax  But it was a point  Because then you  Fucking make those  Chinese companies  Come here 
[02:20:00]  Open a plant  So American workers  Are making these  Chinese products  That makes sense  You know it  Disgusted me  How Apple  Was talking shit  About actually  Making anything  In the United States  If they were to  Take one product  And make it in  Detroit  They could fucking  Help turn that  City around  But you know  There's been all  These people saying  Why don't you make  Anything here  And they say  Oh you know  The workers are so  Much more flexible  In China  You're like  Well we change the  Screen on the  iPhone  And they  You know  We go around  To the dormitories  And knock  And wake people up  Who had just  Got off shift  And make them  Come back to work 
[02:20:30]  I'm like yeah  It's because that's  Fucking inhumane  Americans wouldn't  Put up with that shit  First off  Having to live in a  Dorm by work  That fucking blows  The only problem is though  Would Americans be  Willing to pay a lot  More money  Because again  With unions and stuff  Fucking it's going to  Be a lot more expensive  To make  And the labor's a lot  More expensive  And the product  Will be more expensive  So like as a company  What do you do  I'm just playing  But what do you do  Because you're going to  Have to charge  Instead of $400 for an iPhone  You have to charge  $650 or $700  See I don't buy that  Because Apple's now  The largest company  In the world  Aren't they  I mean 
[02:21:00]  Dude they're making  Mad cash  On everything  They're not  They're not making like  20 bucks on each iPhone  They're making a wee bit more  Yeah yeah  But would they  They don't want to give up  Let's say they give up  A big piece of that profit  By paying  Again this is going to be  Their argument  The stock is going to go down  Because the profit margin  Is going to be lower  Because instead of paying  Fucking $1.50 to a guy  They got to pay  $25 for an hour  So they're like  We're going to lose that money  For the same thing  Why would we  We'll cut that on shipping  Who gives a shipping  That's their thinking 
[02:21:30]  It just concerns me  Because you know  A place without  Strong manufacturing  Yeah  Nosedives  I mean look at Germany  They've got tons of manufacturing  They've seemed to figure out  How to keep  You know  A middle class  That's happy  And  Right  Has jobs  As opposed to here  Where it's like  All we have is the service industry  And we used to have that  We used to have  In the 50s and the 40s  And everybody built a lot of shit  Oh the good old days  Yeah  The cars and everything  Was coming from here  Water fountains  When people kept to themselves  And for their own kind  We're fucking the middle class 
[02:22:00]  At this point in this country  But what's the answer though  I don't know what the answer is  But it's tough  It's not good  Because the middle class  Needs to work  And they need to fucking  Make things  But  It's so much cheaper  To buy shit  That's made at other places  When you look at  Some of those unions  I mean  The perfect example  The Long Island Railroad  Which I wrote in on  This morning  Has cut their service  Like crazy  There's not as many trains  Right  They raised rates  By 25%  And  Meanwhile  Like 90 something percent  Of their employees 
[02:22:30]  Go out on disability  Oh yeah  On the taxpayers  Fucking dime  Because you can  It's easy to  And they get a $100,000 salary  For the rest of their lives  Right  It's insanity  You'd be crazy  To not go out on disability  It's like  Why wouldn't you?  It's totally available to you  No one questions it  Oh yeah  My back  And then they just  Punching tickets  I fucked my back  Just don't get caught bowling  Yeah yeah  Don't get caught bowling  Or playing golf  Yeah  Gotta be careful with that stuff  Plenty of those people around  What'd you do 
[02:23:00]  While you were down there  I love when you go to these countries  And bring back stories  We went down there to  We get picked up  We went down there to record  A bunch of stuff for Max Payne 3  And we've taken other trips down there  Which I wasn't on any of those  But we show up  And they  Before we even go  There's like a security consultant  That's like  Gets in touch with me  And he sends me the picture  Of our driver  Right  Because kidnapping  Is such a who-ha  Down there  Wow  You know  And before I go  All these people are like  Dude really  Seriously  I'm not fucking around  Be careful  I'm like 
[02:23:30]  Where the fuck am I going?  What the fuck?  Don't wear a watch  Don't wear a good watch  Wear a cheap plastic watch  Take the watch  Put it up your ass  They're like  Don't look at your Blackberry  Or your iPhone  I thought this was safer than Rio  It looks like a modernized city  Except for their little shanty towns  You're not seeing the crackheads  Yeah go to street level  Right right  Take it to street level yo  But  So  So right before I leave  The security guy contacts me  And says  There's a different driver now 
[02:24:00]  We're very worried  And let us get back to you  I'm like  What the fuck?  It's the old driver switcheroo  And so  The old driver switcheroo  And they're really worried about this  Dude bugging out  That's fucking crazy  In America where we go  Where's whatever  Oh I don't know  Wait  You called in sick  So I'm going to drive you from the airport  Yeah  Now he called in sick  He's had a cold all winter  Have some brandy  So  He didn't work on the Godfather either  We saw it happen  So wait  The security guy was with you? 
[02:24:30]  No no no  The security guy we're just in touch with  He provides security for  Many like rock star  Take two  Kind of people that are going into  Because we go into dodgy places  Sure  When did he know that the driver was different?  So he got contacted by the company down there that he works with  And then he contacts me while we're still at the airport to fly  And here's the other thing as a dumb American that I didn't realize  It is a long time to get to South America  Well every time I go to the Caribbean and places like that 
[02:25:00]  I'm like that was a short flight  You know you just think it's all  It's all that area  It's all that area  And it's like  Really?  11 hours on a plane?  11 hours  Holy fuck  And the other thing that's weird is  You know you're used to flying one direction towards Europe  Or south towards the Caribbean or something  You're flying in the weirdest direction across the ocean  When you're watching the little map on the plane  Oh because like  The Earth curves  The curvature of the Earth  You'd think you'd go down like over Mexico  Right 
[02:25:30]  And then straight down  But you've got to kind of curve out and back in again  So we show up at the airport  Which is hot as balls  And the driver  You know I'm holding the picture up  And it's the picture sort of looks like him  But he's you know put on a little weight  I'm like oh my god  You sure as hell  So we get in  And I ask if I can roll down the window  And he gets really moody  And he's like  There's no rolling down the window here sir  I was like alright  I said you know 
[02:26:00]  And the glass dude  Is like that bank teller glass  You know like  I can see why you can't fucking roll the window down  And I said  So this is bulletproof glass  And he said  He tells me that the whole car  He said  You have to be worried about people  Just putting a gun  On top of the car  And pulling a trigger  And shooting a bullet  Straight down through your head  So that part  Is bulletproof as well  And then he informed me  That in case somebody puts a bomb  Under the car 
[02:26:30]  While we're on the way to the hotel  That the undercarriage  Will keep me from getting my legs blown off  And stuff  It's nice to know  This is a really relaxing city  Why do all you guys in the car  Sit on your helmets?  So we  So I have to go to the bank  To change American dollars  Into  Brazilian reals  You didn't want to do it at the airport?  Was the rate exchange shitty there?  They just  They told us that  For security reasons  They wanted to drive us to 
[02:27:00]  A bank  And the  Oh boy  The banks down there  Dude  Are a fucking trip  You can't get in  You have to go through  A rotating door  Yep  And it's a metal detector  So  You know  We're used to revolving doors  Dude I  I'm like  I'm walking through  The fucking bank front door  And the door goes slam  I smash my face into it  And then there's people  Like screaming Portuguese at me  That I've got metal on me  So you actually have to  Shove all your stuff  Through this little window  This is to get in the bank  Holy shit 
[02:27:30]  That's crazy  The driver had to case  The outside of the bank  For us  Because a lot of robberies  Happen right outside the bank  And the security guards  At the bank  They don't give a fuck  Like they are not coming outside  To help your ass  Yeah  Because it's all  You know again  Bulletproof  They just care about  What's happening in there  So  So we get inside  And they take us off  To this special room  It's the wild west  It's crazy  And this woman  Comes back  And she looks really nervous  She says  There's a man out there  Asking for two Americans  I'm like  Oh here's where it 
[02:28:00]  Fucking goes down dude  And I haven't slept  Because we've flown  All fucking night  And  You were in a video game  Dude  It was  That's fucking like  You were in the game  Rio  Make a withdrawal  Yeah  What was weird about  Going from the airport  To the bank  In Sao Paulo  Is there's  You know  We've already modeled  A bunch of the city  In the game  And I was like  Looking out the window  I was like  Fuck man  There's a level  Right over there  I know  I know that road  And so  She comes back  And says  Oh actually  You know 
[02:28:30]  It's just your driver  He was getting nervous  That you'd been  Inside too long  So then I get  All this money  And  He makes us wait  By the front door  And he goes  And cases the outside again  And pulls the front  The car  Like right up  To the front door  And he's like  You run  To the car  I'm like  Really  Oh man  Dude  I'm so  At this point  I'm like  What are we doing  We're going  All this effort  For a video game  So what happens  You get  You run  You run  To the car  He's obviously armed  Yeah  And so  Anyway 
[02:29:00]  Then we  He takes us  To the hotel  Makes sure  That everything's cool  And then  They wanted to  Provide security  For us  For the rest of the time  And I was like  Now we have a producer  Down there  And so the rest of the week  I'm riding around  Like a Ford Focus  No security  No security  Just trying to keep  Everything on  The DL  You know  Not flashing  Fancy phones  Or whatever  But it's an amazing city  The people are  That we met  And hung out with  Were really cool  And it's such a 
[02:29:30]  It's like  There's more  Helicopter traffic  In that city  Than any other city  In the world  Because the traffic  Is so fucked up  That people just  Take helicopters  From place to place  Did you take any?  No  Dude I'm scared  To death of helicopters  I wonder how much  They cost  Are they cheap?  Plus there's a lot of people  That don't want to get robbed  So they want to go  They want to land  On the top of the building  Where they live  Or whatever  It's probably expensive  They'd probably take advantage  Just walk around  With like  Wads of cash in your hand  I have so much money  Just pound it in the street  I'm so rich 
[02:30:00]  I'm so rich in this city  This is great  My god  I'm American  Right  I have rich family members  At home  We'd be driving to the studio  And you'd sort of go through  This weird checkpoint  Of guys with literally  Fingers on machine guns  Yeah  It's like  Oof  Did you walk into a favela?  They have tours  I didn't do one when I went  No  I wish I had  A bunch of rock star guys  Have gone through the favelas  Because they wanted to make it  Authentic for the game  And what do they do?  Do they film in there?  Oh yeah  How do they do that  Without the bag?  You have to make a deal  With the local drug dealer  Oh yeah  Really?  You've got to pay off 
[02:30:30]  The local gang  Enough money  And say  We're going to be bringing  These people in  They want to look around  And take some pictures  So that we can make  A video game  Back in North America  Trust me  It was a bit of a  Stressful negotiation  I'm sure  But the gangs  It's weird though  They won't  They won't rob you  If the gangs  Are letting you in  I don't think  Right?  I'm assuming they won't  I think anything goes  Sounds like a crazy place  Not if they know  You made a deal  With the gangs  The guys who run the favelas  They're all run by drug lords 
[02:31:00]  Then your life  Would be a living hell  After you guys  Cleared out  The other thing  The other thing  That was weird  Is there's tons  Of motorcycle traffic  And it's against the law  For two people  To be on a motorcycle  Oh really?  Because the traffic's so bad  What happens is  One guy is driving the bike  The guy on the back  Just has a gun  And taps on fucking windows  And robs cars  One after the other  And drives off  No  What a great gimmick  So to combat that problem  They just said  No you can't take  Your friend anywhere  Wow 
[02:31:30]  God what a bunch of criminals  Genius though right?  It's crazy  It's a fantastic city though  The food was amazing  You didn't see any of that shit  It wasn't poison  Did you have to have someone  Taste it?  No  Geez  No we recorded every day  From like 10 in the morning  To 11 o'clock or midnight  How long were you down there?  For over a week  But you didn't see any of the shit  You're describing?  No the last day  We went out  And went downtown  And you know  Got to see legitimate prostitutes 
[02:32:00]  And that kind of fun stuff  Was it scary or no?  How far was your hotel  From where you had to record?  Like well  By traffic  Sometimes it was like  An hour and a half  But if there wasn't  I'd get a hotel closer  20 minutes  Yeah that was a bit  Of a nerve wracking thing too  Is trying to figure out  Like  How nice of a hotel  Like  Will I not get fucking  Cracked over on the head  In this one?  Or  Were you constantly  Looking around  Like oh god  Am I going to get  Fucking pounced? 
[02:32:30]  Well see I grew up  In a paranoid household  Anyway  Because my dad  Was a drug narc  And had a contract  Out on his life  When I was a kid  So  We had guns  All over the house  Like constantly waiting  Before home invasions  Were cool  We had  Like  We would stack  We would stack soda cans  And stuff  In front of the doors  In case somebody  Oh really?  So you'd hear that?  So you'd hear that  And  I remember the one time  I almost got shot  In the face  By my father  Was as a kid  I thought it would be  Hysterical  If I  Happened to Jimmy 
[02:33:00]  When he  When he came home  I mean you know  He was out like  Buying heroin  And shit from people  When he came home  I thought I'd hide  Behind the door  And scare him  Oh good  Really good idea  Wow  Gun out  Nearly  Nearly took me out  He was a drug narc?  Yeah  He gnarred to the government  No no  He worked for the cops  Oh  There was a bunch of heroin  Moving  This is the 70's  There was a bunch of heroin  Moving up from Mexico  He was a cop  He got some horse 
[02:33:30]  Coming in  Yeah  Some horse coming through  Oklahoma  Your dad was a cop?  Yeah  Oh okay  I thought he turned  States evidence  No no no  That would suck too  That's not what he meant  I thought he drugged  I thought he gnarced  He ratted  Who put a hit on him?  Somebody busted  No obviously  Yeah  Mafia  No just some big  Just some big  Drug lord  They must hate  When they lose  A lot of heroin  That's coming in  Yeah but you can't put a hit  On the cops though  Because it just makes  What do you think  The cops are going to do  If you murder a cop?  What if he's a bad cop?  What if he's a dirty cop? 
[02:34:00]  You're right  They just might  We do have people  On the payroll  But they  That just makes  Someone at the papers  It makes  They'd like a story like that  They'd like a story like that  They might  They just might  But it fucking makes life  Miserable for everybody  If they kill a cop  It's just stupid to do  It doesn't stop them  From doing it  Especially  But like I said  When they lose that  Huge shipment of heroin  You can't just go  Yeah the cops took it  Oh okay  What happens to the guy 
[02:34:30]  That is supposed to  Bring it up  Like when he has to  Go back and go  Yeah the cops got it  Well there's a story  In Max Mermelstein's book  Called The Man Who Made It Snow  About Max Mermelstein  Who was one of the first Americans  If not he got deep deep  Inside the  Medellin cartel  Because he married  A Colombian girl  And helped her brother  Hide a body  Like he didn't know  What was happening  Like he didn't  Oh shit  But the guy  Introduced him as  My compadre  And once they do that  That means I'm vouching  For this American  With my life  So he gets into  The Colombian cartel 
[02:35:00]  He actually  Goes over to Colombia  And he gets to meet  Like Pablo Escobar  And I think Luis Gacha  Who was alive at the time  Get a picture with him  There is a picture of  I don't know if  Blow was based on him  Or around his life  Oh right  Okay  It might have been  But  See Jimmy down there  Pablo  Pablo  Just taps him on the arm  Get a picture  I gotta get a picture  With Pablo  Then I'm twittering  And like  I'm fucking Pablo  But  There was one 
[02:35:30]  The Osha brothers  I think were the guys  Who ran it with Escobar  And they would drop  Fucking heroin in bundles  Or coke in bundles  Out of prop planes  And it would hit the water  And you'd collect it  It was a genius way  Of doing it  But a couple of the bags  Broke open  And they lost  A lot of coke  Oh shit  A lot of coke  And they had  He had to go  Or him and the pilot  Had to go to Colombia  And explain  And they didn't know  If they were going  To make it out alive  No shit  Wouldn't you just  Take off at that point 
[02:36:00]  No you can't  They'd kill your family  Oh then you'd die  And they'd kill your whole family  And the thing was  It's the cost of doing business  Oh really  The cost of doing business  Is you will lose  Some product sometimes  You think he fucked with them  A little bit though  When they were there  Like thinking they're going to die  And you're like  Hey  Go into that room over there  And there's a party for them  Streamers  This might have been  The first time they did it  Just kidding  This might have been  The first time they did it  Or one of the first times  It was a brand new way  Of delivering coke 
[02:36:30]  And then all of a sudden  They lose  Wow  That's how they used to have  A fucking  The way they  I think I've said this before  They would have  They would load the coke  Into a car  Like they would take  A car apart  And all the sides of it  Had coke in it  And the tire  It was a coke car  And they would tow it  And put it on the back  Of a tow truck  Because that was a lot less  Likely to attract attention  Than a guy driving  So they'd have a tow truck driver  Pulling the coke car  And they would send  Another guy out  Right behind it  With a bottle of liquor  And if by chance  The tow truck got pulled over 
[02:37:00]  This fucking guy  Was going to drink  And fucking run  Into the cop car  That was parked  Because that would  Take the attention  Right  Off the coke  And then the car  Would just drive back  Into traffic  That was their plan  If  You know  Not to kill the cop  But just to fucking  Rear end his car  While it was parked  And a guy drunk  Rear ending a cop car  They're going to focus on him  What a fall guy  That guy's got to be  Yeah but the thing is  Life in prison for everybody  Yeah  If you don't do that  Wow  Yeah  Must hear moments  For the past six months

[02:41:00]  We've actually never met  No  No  But Shaq has helped some comedians  So I'm certainly hoping  Oh okay  Up for helping  Helping some more  We made Kevin Hart famous  Oh he did  Yeah  Jimmy  Jimmy knows Kevin Hart  Real well  Yeah we kind of  Came up together  Yeah  Even though I'm a lot  Older than him  And he shot past me  But I'm happy for him  Good to see a friend  Shoot by you  What got you involved  In the roast  Like did you  Did you want to be roasted  Are you just a fan of comedy  Well I'm a fan of comedy  And I saw it was a big  Void in comedy  So 
[02:41:30]  I just made all the  Comedians offers  They couldn't refuse  Oh you  Good money and TV  Exactly  Did anybody say no to that  No  Why would they say no to that  That sounds like  A great fucking opportunity  Were you sensitive  About any of it  Like was there anything  No I mean  I probably have  The greatest sense of humor ever  I like to laugh  I like to make people laugh  And you know  Like I said  There was a void there  And nobody was really doing it  Russell was doing it first  And then 
[02:42:00]  You know  I turned on HBO  And it's not there anymore  So  I tried it  At an all star game  Because you know  At all star events  Everybody's there  So  So let's do it  At an all star game  And  My partner  Jeff  Clannigan and I  And we did it  And it was such a success  He was like  You know what  This can't be true  Let's do it again  And we did it again  And we recorded it  And we said  Let's sell it  See how people like it  And  We sell  Sell over 400,000 copies  Every time we drop  Oh my god  That's awesome  And none of it 
[02:42:30]  None of it made you go like  Ugh  No  No  Because you know  I like to laugh  And you know  It would be like  It would be like  Coming up here  And telling you guys  What to say  And how to say it  That's what the bosses do  Yeah  That's their job  Obviously  Obviously they don't  Because you guys  Are one of the  Most popular shows  Of the world  Thank you very much  Roland probably said  That on the way in  Just tell them  They're popular  They'll be really good to you  That's why we like it here  Because they don't bother us  As far as that shit goes  For the most part  Hey we're all smelling  Like your Dove products 
[02:43:00]  We have to say it  They gave it to us  Last week  Yeah we honestly  At first didn't even know  Why they were bringing in  The products  And we're like  Oh wow  This is good  Yeah  And then I started  Seeing the commercials  And we've been using  The body wash  And that's why  You're here for  For the most part  Right  Well obviously  You guys have always  Been comfortable  In your own skin  And you know  It's a great product  I've been using it  Even before  We joined the  Strategic partnership  But you know  I thought it was  A great commercial  You know 
[02:43:30]  My mom came by  The house  To check on me  And I was like  You've got to be  In this commercial  With me  And it's a great commercial  And you know  The Dove  Men's Care product  Is a great line  Especially the body wash  I actually like the size  And the price  Yeah  Because I'm a guy  I like to keep my  Stuff clean  During the day  It is a big size  But it smells good  It's like the deodorant  Is actually really fresh  Yeah  And I put it on  And I'm very pleased  With myself  It smells good  Yeah we were hoping  You would notice  That we smell like 
[02:44:00]  Your product  Yeah but it's just  Kind of awkward  To fucking lean in  Smell me  Right  You get a lot of  Endorsements  Which is great  I mean you're kind of  You're one of the  Sports stars  That have really done well  As far as endorsements  Me or Shaq  Not you  We're waiting for our  First endorsement  Well yeah  I mean I've  I've taken care of  Business since I came in  And you know  Whenever I meet  With a company  I always tell them  I'm not really interested  In endorsement  But you know  In a strategic partnership  And I've also been  The type that 
[02:44:30]  If I'm not  Comfortable with the product  Or if I've never  Used your product  Then I'll be  An honest businessman  And not take your money  Have you ever worried  About things that you  Say  Because you've said  Some controversial  Albeit funny  But some people  See it as controversial  Not at all  Yeah  Because to me  Image is reality  Yeah  Those that come in  With the suits  And create their image  They're the ones  That have to watch out  So you figure  There's nothing  They can get you on  Where you can fall  Because you're going to say  Hey this is me  No not really  You know  People  People 
[02:45:00]  People see me  They know  That I'm a humble guy  They know  That I'm a funny guy  They know  I'm always saying  What's on my mind  You got some great quotes  Too man  Oh my god  Some people would say  They should use that soap  To wash your mouth out  With Mr. Reilly  No way  I'm a role model  Cut it out  No way  Your Kobe quote  To this day  Makes me howl man  How is my ass  Take it  I'm just saying it man  Makes me fucking howl  But it's refreshing  To see guys say 
[02:45:30]  What's on their mind  Guys like Barkley  Always talk  And it's like  I don't want to hear  Somebody giving the company line  That's not interesting to me  I'm not  And then you know what  Being a marketing expert  I know what's going to get  Everybody riled up  Right  Like I know  When to say it  And how to say it  That incident  I was at one of those  Little comedy clubs  They called you up on stage  And I did a little rap  And somebody recorded it  And sold it for 500  Jesus  You know  They tried to make  A big deal out of it  Yeah  That was at Norm's place  Down in the village  Was it the Fat Black Pussycat 
[02:46:00]  I think  It was one of those  Because the comedy  Saw was right on the corner  It was like one of those  It was like one of those  Little underground clubs  Oh yeah  Maybe the village underground  But you know what  The funny thing is  When this stuff gets out  Everybody talks about it  Like you're going to get a spanking  Yeah  Did you see what  Chuck said today  I know  It's true  Yeah  That's kind of the society  We're living in these days  Where everybody's walking  On eggshells  But what I respect about  He didn't apologize  No  He just let it happen  And just went with it  Because you know  I was at a comedy club  I was at a setting  Right  The context  And I know I rocked the crowds 
[02:46:30]  About 500 people  And they're having a good time  Yeah  You know  It's just  People use that  To create their show  I just love that  I understand  As a sports fan  I understand  You guys have got to have  Sportsmanship to a point  But it gets sickening  After a while  I like when you guys are real  About losses  And certain plays  And players  Everyone knows  That I'm a little comedian  Those that can't take it  Yeah  I'm sorry  Get a sense of humor  Buy one  They're on the internet  $4.99  At senseofhumor.com  Well you're one of those 
[02:47:00]  Big guys too  It was interesting to me  That when you were coming up  That you would always  Try to make people laugh  And be the funny guy  Like you were either  The funny guy  Or the bully  Like you were either  Going to get big laughs  From somebody  Or they were going to go home  With the fucking jaw shattered  So you have like two options  Which I think was interesting  When you'd move to a new place  You would just try  To make people laugh first  Before you would try  To dominate them another way  Yeah because I'm  I mean I'm a really  Funny sensitive guy  And I never wanted  Wanted to have to fight  But when they used to say  Shaquilla and Sasquatch  Oh shit  That's it  Kicking your ass right now 
[02:47:30]  Three o'clock  Who the hell  Would say that to you  A lot of people  How dumb  How dumb do you have to be  Yeah at what point  Does that stop  I had to bust a lot of heads  Well it stopped  It stopped like  It stopped like  After the first couple weeks  When I got there  Yeah  Because you know  It's just like  You know those jail movies  You get there  And you find out  Who the toughest kid is  Right  I was like  This guy right here  With the ponytail in the back  Oh wait a minute  I'm going to kill this guy  So you do  You see him at three  And you steal on him  And you beat him up  In front of everybody  And then the next day  You get major respect 
[02:48:00]  Right  It bothers you  I wouldn't know about  Anything like that  No I miss Shaq in the NBA  Because you know  There's not a lot of  Personality right now  Not a lot of guys  Stepping up and just being  You know  Personable  And saying some crazy stuff  Yeah  At all  Who would you say  Is in the league that  Nobody  Really right  It's different  LeBron is a  LeBron is a bore  When he's not playing  I always tell my kids  That you know  When I was coming up  The league was  More fabulous than there is now  Right 
[02:48:30]  Every team  Even the bad teams  Just think about  Like in the 80's  Even a team like Denver  Alex English  You know  Every  Every team had a great player  Right  Anybody ever tell you  You look like Boomer Esiason  Oh man  Yeah  Oh wow  Yeah  Boomer  Went to school with Boomer  Back in  Anthony had a fight  With Boomer Esiason  Fifth grade  I punched him in the forehead  And broke my arm  A dick headed motherfucker  Dick headed  Yeah Anthony  Punched him  Yeah  Broke both fucking arms  Broke my arm  Both bones in your right arm 
[02:49:00]  I've done like golf tournaments  With him though  After that  So he's cool  I like Boomer  He's a fun guy  Yeah he's alright  Good guy  You're very business savvy  Obviously  When did that start  Like you're going  You're going for the sport part of it  You're good at basketball  You know  That's going to be part of it  When do you start to realize  That that's necessary  One day  I was on punishment  And my father came in  And he hit me  In the head with a book  And he said  If you ever  Start being a leader  And a follower  You could become somebody  So anyway 
[02:49:30]  I read the book  And the book was about Kareem  And how he lost everything  So one of my fears  As an athlete  Or as a professional person  Was losing everything  So  He invested in soybeans  Kareem right  That was a big loss for him  We had Kareem in here  And we weren't really allowed  To ask him any basketball questions  He had a publicist  We felt sorry for Kareem Abdul-Jawar  Believe it or not  He was having a great time  But afterwards  He wasn't too thrilled  That we talked about basketball  As well as the book  Yeah  And we didn't even get to ask him about that 
[02:50:00]  Get his personality  He lost it all what?  Back in the 70s?  Yeah  Soy beans and everything  So  That investment  Wow  It was always one of my fears  Coming up  So  And those guys didn't make as much money back then  So the investing was important  When I first came in  I was making a lot of money  I think my first year  I made a lot  I don't want to say  I don't want to say the number  But it was a lot  It would probably depress the listeners  I mean we understand that kind of money  But they  You asshole  So then  Another time I was  I was in the arena  Hey buddy  Dude scared me 
[02:50:30]  Oh he rocks you  Yeah  Like looking at an animal  Behind a glass wall  He's very athletic  As he chews  Something there  So then I met Magic Johnson  And Magic Johnson told me  You know  He grabbed me by the arm  And he's like  It's good to be the man  But you want to start owning stuff  And I was like  What the hell is Magic talking about?  And then like  As I played in LA  And I saw the stuff he was doing  In the community and development  And I was like  You know what  Let me do that  And while I'm doing it  Let me go back and get my masters  Because  Like when I have conversations with people  Of course they're going to look at me as Shaq 
[02:51:00]  But I want them to know  That I understand  Like when I go  In with CEOs  And they know I got my masters in business  They know that  They can't let anything  They can't mess with you  No frees  No coin  No nothing  And now I'm getting my PhD  May 5th  In HRD  Organizational leadership  Dr. Shaquille  Dr. Shaquille on you?  Yes  Dr. O'Neill  What's HRD?  Human Resource Development  So when you  How do you find  This is the scary part for me  Is because  Most guys you get a business manager  And it's scary to find somebody  That you can trust  Who you know isn't going to rip you off 
[02:51:30]  Like do you just go on  I check my stuff all the time  And there's not much to check  But I'm obsessed with the idea  That somebody's just  I'm going to just have to see zeros one time  Steal his money  And make it to Newark  Well you have to  You have to like  You know trust people  Like when I came in  I  I interviewed the top four firms  And three of them  It even said in like  You know Kareem's book  Like if it's too good to be true  Stay away from  So one guy came in  A  And I noticed you made this much  We can double it and triple it  He's out 
[02:52:00]  Right  Another guy  We'll do this and we'll do that  He's out  And I met a little  Little guy  A little Jewish guy  Said hey I can put it in savings bonds  And get you some annuities  And I can manage your money  And make sure I was like  I like that guy  Yeah we got the little Jewish guy too  Yeah you gotta go  You gotta go  Shalom  You gotta go  Little Jewish guy every time  You just have to  You got it  You just got it  That's very smart  I'm telling you it's smart  Because as far as being an athlete goes  You never really know 
[02:52:30]  When that machine is just going to stop working  As far as that  And you know  You can have a long  Illustrious career  Make a lot of money  Or you could be done in a year  Yeah you could be done in a year  Like when I first came in  And my agent told me  I was going to be making this much  I'm like seriously  But I mean  In the real world  When you're done playing  There's no way  You're going to make that much  No way  Right  So you gotta  No way  Unless you get one of them  Google, Facebook, IPOs  But there's no way  So you gotta save it  Or you gotta make it work 
[02:53:00]  What do you think the difference is  Between somebody like you  That actually realized that  And people that just decide  They're going to  Kind of play it by  Fear  Fear you think  Yeah fear  Was that from your stepfather you think  Like kind of drilling it into you  Yeah stepfather  Just being fear  And just you know  Not  You know  Just being able to live  The same lifestyle  Like you know  For a guy that doesn't have  Any business savvy  The only word he should memorize  Is annuity  Yeah  Yeah  Put money away  And then at a certain age  You get to take it off 
[02:53:30]  For the rest of your life  That's it  No investments  No buying businesses  No trying to do restaurants  Just annuity  And that was the first thing I did  It'll be there when you're  You know  Ready to  It'll be there when you're done  Just relax  Is that annuity's money  That you don't get taxed on  And then you can't  I like to  I sound like I'm saying it  But I'm really asking  It's tax deferred  Tax deferred until  You take it out  You start using it  Defer that shit  And then sometimes  You get a lower tax rate  Based on  I met a guy one time  He had a  He had a  Hundred dollar bill  And he ripped it in half  And he said  You put that 50 away 
[02:54:00]  And annuity  You never touch it  You got 50 left  Now the small ones  That ripped that 50 in half  And you save 75  And you play with 25  And that's what I tried to do  But Shaq  You can't spend half the bill  Well he was just trying to  Smart guy  I've never wanted to see  I've never wanted to see  A fist fly in front of me so bad  You know  Shaq  You know a few guys  That were pretty  Pretty big stars in the NBA  That are broke  I don't know if  I don't know if you want to mention names 
[02:54:30]  They say they're broke  I don't really know their finances  But  Yeah there's a few guys  Off the top of my head  That didn't do a lot of the stuff  You're saying  And they are  They're in a desperate situation  Right now  No like I said earlier  Because of fear  I never wanted to be in that position  Like I never  You know  First thing I did  Was buy my mom and parents a house  Like I said to myself  I'm going to work hard  So  They don't ever have to get their phone call  Like hey  At the house  I would do that  So you could have somewhere to live  If everything fucks up  I know right  Watch your house  When did you know it was time to like  When you're playing 
[02:55:00]  It's always interesting to me  When an athlete steps down  Like that's got to be the hardest decision  You have to make  Like what told you  It's time to just  Go on to something else  It wasn't hard  I was used to playing  At a super high level  So then when I started playing  At a regular level  It just didn't look good  Or feel good  Like  I can remember one time  In Boston  I only had six points  I was like  This shit ain't me  I mean  Yeah you're trying to curse  Oh like a mother  Yeah  Like  This isn't me  And you know  It doesn't last forever  And you know  Luckily I have things  To fall back on 
[02:55:30]  And I wish I could have  Did a little bit better  At Boston last year  But I ripped my Achilles in half  You know my goal  Was to win the whole thing  And then just walk away  That would have been a nice way  To end the story  But you know  I had fun  And had a great press conference  And you know  We moved on  Who was the first guy  You played against  That kind of like  Was one of your idols  Or the first time  You had to face somebody  On the court  That made you nervous  Patrick Ewing  Ewing  Really  That was when I came here  To the guard  And articles  And Patrick Ewing  Tried to break my thumb  When he gave me a fist bump 
[02:56:00]  Oh shit  But I knew  I knew  I knew marketing wise  That if you can play in New York  You can play anywhere  So  I shot it  I made it  And it felt pretty good  I was like  So you know what  I'll do it  Suffering Knicks fan right here  We would have loved to have you  Jeez  All these years  It's been a drought  For the Knicks  What do you think  Of the Knicks team right now  And Jeremy Lin  And all that  Pretty good  You know  I've been waiting for  Been waiting for Carmelo  And Amari  To step up  Amari's out though 
[02:56:30]  Yeah he's out  For probably the rest of the year  It's a  You know  Carmelo  Huh  Carmelo's a great player  But at some point in his career  He's going to have to take it personal  That they talk about him fifth  You know  When I was coming up  Even though they had Ewing and Robinson  I was like  I'm going to make you guys  Talk about me first  I don't care who was there  So  You know  He's a great player  He just has to  You know  Step up and  And lead  Yeah  And I tell him this  Every time I say  Like hey  We need more out of you  It's not enough to  You know  Hit shots every now and then  You gotta  You gotta put up 
[02:57:00]  Big numbers  And you gotta dominate  Do you think Jeremy Lin's  The real deal  A lot of hype obviously  No he's  You know  A good player  But you know  What he did  You know  Kid came out of nowhere  And brought the Knicks  From seven games  To you know  Brought them to 500  And then  You know  Reality kicked in  But you know  He's a smart player  He's a smart player  Have you really been  Training in MMA  Since 2000  Yes  What do you take  And do you like  To watch it  Oh I love to watch it  I think those guys  Are phenomenal athletes  Kind of jealous of them 
[02:57:30]  I wish  You know  We could have  Did some of that stuff  In the NBA  But you know  They're great athletes  I would like to see that too  That'd be hilarious  It's a great sport  The Fertito brothers  And Dana White  Have done a fabulous job  We love Dana  Yeah  Of you know  Just making me  A great sport  Every time I get a chance  I always go  It's just fabulous  You got a favorite fighter  Or a fight you want to see  Well I want to see  The John Bones Jones  Against Rashad Evans fight  Who do you want  In that one  Well I mean  No disrespect to John Bones 
[02:58:00]  But I'm down with the old guys  So you know  Rashad  And I've been a fan of his  And you know  They know each other  So I think it's going to be  I think it's going to be  A very very interesting fight  I'm kind of pulling for Rashad too  Yeah we had Bones  We had all those guys  And I always get  Like a move put on me  Or something  And he choked  He choked me  And this guy Bob  But he choked a little longer  Than he was supposed to  Yeah you made a great sound  A little longer yeah  He just went  And  Fantastic  He made it hurt  Rashad put me in a move too  What was the move  He put me in a floor move 
[02:58:30]  Which was awful  With his thighs  But he stopped immediately  So I want to see Rashad pull it off  It was a prison assault  Is what it was  It looked bad  How about Chael Sonnen  Fighting Silva  In Brazil  In front of 80,000 people  Who?  Chael Sonnen  Is fighting  Oh Chael Sonnen  He fought Silva  A few years ago  And he actually  He beat him for five hours  Oh  Shaq just looked at Iraq  Walking in the middle  Of his interview  He's looking behind the glass  Oh wait a minute  That guy was in there  Oh he sees Paul  That guy was over there  Watch it now 
[02:59:00]  Then that guy looks like  Is from one of those  Watch it  Looks like one of those  A&E biker shows  Shaq  Why are you in here  You just distracted  Our interview with Shaq  You just blundered in  We're professional broadcasters  We're having fun  I wasn't trying to  I was going to pull up  The video of you getting choked  Oh boy  He doesn't care about that  You don't care  What are we going to play videos  For Shaq  We're talking to him  Hey Shaq  You want to see my home movies  What are we going to do  Bring my photo album in  Why don't you show them  Your comic book collection  Fucking get out  Just kidding  Hit the bricks 
[02:59:30]  Hit the bricks  You interested in guns  You like shooting  Law enforcement right  Yeah I'm law enforcement  That's pretty god damn cool  I don't want a few  I just  You know as a guy  And as a citizen  You know I have to be careful  How I answer this question  Yeah I understand  So I do what the law allows me to do  Yeah  Let's just put it that way  But do you enjoy going to the range  And bless them around  The only time I go to the range  Is when it's law enforcement purposes  Okay I hear you  Alright  Yeah 
[03:00:00]  I understand  Plus when you're in a position  Where you're  Again you're one of the most  Recognizable guys in the country  Is there any  When's the last time  You went somewhere  Where nobody in the room  Knew who you were  And you could just kind of  Relax and eat  And probably can't  Nowhere  Nowhere  Like maybe when you were a teenager  Was the last time you went up  Nowhere  Jesus Christ  That's gotta be  When were they paying attention to you  At what age  15  15 years old  My god  Wow  I guess you get used to it  Like everything you do  Is going to be seen  And reported on  Right  Does it make you text differently  And email differently  And communicate differently privately  No 
[03:00:30]  You have no fear  That it's gonna be  Yeah because  Most of the stuff I do  Is not 99%  Filonious  So  Every now and then  Person may sell a text  Or tell an email  But  Right  My mother  My mother always  Calls me and tells me  Her  Her favorite bible  Bible quote  No weapon formed against me  Shall prosper  So you can sell a text  And sell an email  And get your 1500  But  Is that how much they go for  I guess  I don't know  Thank god I'm not famous  Oh is there a lot of dirt 
[03:01:00]  Out there on me  Don't worry about it  Yeah I have no  Believe me  If I ever become an athlete  Or become famous  There is a lot of filth  Did you just say  Become an athlete  Well yeah I was kidding  I was just kidding  I was  I like a little mixed martial arts  I mean Shaq's very tall  But I can always get in there  And take him down on a single  No way  Oh sure  No way  No I stink  Not only am I short  But I've never  I do a little elliptical  I mean you know  I don't want to talk  A whole bunch of exercise  With Shaq  What 5 minutes  10 minutes  I'm a 30 minute elliptical guy  I play a little  iPad chess  On the elliptical machine 
[03:01:30]  Shaq you still play basketball  No  Not at all  Do you shoot around  Or anything  You just don't want to  I mean I  Just said  I'm just getting over  This Achilles injury  So  Wow yeah  Still got a little hitch  So I haven't done it  I just  I've been working out  The last couple weeks  Charles Barkley  Challenged me to  A shirt off competition  May 15th  So  Oh wow  So I've been  A shirt off competition  I've been comfortable  In my skin for a long time  So I've been working out  I love Barkley  He keeps it real too man  He does 
[03:02:00]  He's great  To watch  What separates you from  Because you seem almost  Like you see a lot of guys  That leave the game  But then there's guys  Like you and Jordan  Who seem to be kind of  Above basketball  Ending  Who you are  And people knowing you  It's like you just  Kind of continued being  Shaq  In the public eye  It's  You know it's luck  You know  I go to a lot of corporations  And they ask me my strategy  And I was like  Well I don't really have a strategy  You know I've always  Just been myself  Well sign on the line  You know I just like to  You know throw the product 
[03:02:30]  Out there  And you know  Good thing about products  That if it's real  The people will  Take it to it  So I think  I think you know  There's a lot of kids  That look at me  And say you know what  If he did it  I can do it  Rather than you know  Coming in faking  And trying to use  The big words  And doing it  Because kids are  The smartest beings  On earth  They know who's real  And they know who's  Making stuff up  And did you  Because you came up  In Newark for a few years  Before I think  You went to  I want to say  It was the south  Or Germany  Yeah Germany  And was there ever a shot 
[03:03:00]  Where you  Because I know you said  You were doing  A little real light  B&Es and stuff  Do you think  That had you not moved  Out of that area  Things might have gone  Totally differently for you  My father probably  Would have stopped me  You know he  Probably would have  Did the police officer  Thing first  And I don't know  And then the army second  Wow yeah  He wasn't putting up  In any of that crap right  He was an old school  Disciplinarian  He was an old school  Disciplinarian  I always tell people  I live the karate kid  Sort of life  Go from the projects  Of Newark  To Germany  To down south Texas  To Louisiana 
[03:03:30]  I think that's why  I'm able to relate  To all people  When did you know  That you had the  Basketball skills  Because it's  It's assumed  That a tall guy  Knows how to play basketball  We've seen it  In every high school  In America  But when did you realize  Oh I got something here  I mean I was always  A very shy kid  I didn't get confidence  Until I heard  Dick Vitale say  This guy  If he decides to go  To the NBA  He'll be the number one pick  Wow  Because coming out of high school  I was always ranked  After New York's own  Kenny Anderson  Not really  So I was always  You know behind him  All the years 
[03:04:00]  So they talked about him  More than they talked about me  So I was like  You know what  Maybe I'm not that good  But then I went to  The McDonald's game  And showed off  And he was like  This guy's going to be  The best big man ever  And then one day  I was in college  And a guy who  I never really liked  Because  I was Magic Johnson  And I had a white friend  Named Mitch Riles  Who looked and acted  Like Larry Bird  So he used to kick my ass  Every day  So I didn't like Larry Bird  For that reason  But one day  I'm walking to college  And Larry Bird says  Shaquille O'Neal 
[03:04:30]  Will be the best big man  Ever to play the game  Wow  And I was like  Damn Larry Bird  Knows who I am  And then all of a sudden  You're like Larry Bird  Love you Larry Legend  And Robert Parrish  Said fuck you  And walked out  This is one of the most  Interesting things  I learned about you  You're a really good dancer  Yes  And I mean  I cut a rug  Now and again  But I would never say  I'm a good dancer  Why did you become  A good dancer  Because before  I started playing  Basketball  I was a break dancer  Really  Yeah I was a break dancer 
[03:05:00]  And basketball  Is all about rhythm  So you know  I think that's what  Makes me a dominant big man  I got rhythm  I got moves  You know  Basketball is 1-2  Or 1-2-3  Yeah I can see  Where you'd be a good dancer  Dancing is 1-2  1-2-3  I can see that  Would help your game Jimmy  No this was like  The interesting thing  Was at a young age  Because you always think  That a big guy  Or a strong guy  Has everything  And you obviously  Like you said  You had people pick on you  Or fuck with you  So you had to develop  These things  So you said  To distract from them  Seeing that about you 
[03:05:30]  You learned  I had to do  What all the little guys  Was doing  I was just break dancing  And I was flipping  And I was running fast  And you know  And I was climbing up walls  And doing parkour  Before it was called parkour  So I did everything I did  I couldn't even pop lock  You know I tried  We all tried  When breaking came out  I think I'm a couple years older  Just not my thing  Any embarrassing pictures  Of you in a neon suit  And big puffy hat  Break dancing  No  No huh  That video would sell  Oh man  Young Shaq 
[03:06:00]  Break dancing  Bringing out the piece of cardboard  In the boombox  Oh wow yeah  So  I say  You also  You stuttered  When you were younger  Was that like  Was that  A constant thing  And how did you overcome that  I overcame  When I met this speech therapist  One day  She said  Just be cool  When you talk  Just be cool  But what happened  Would you get scared  No just like  Like try to talk fast  Or get nervous  And then it would stutter  But now  I know how to be cool  With it  I know how to  Like  Fake a smile 
[03:06:30]  Say um  And you know  Just you know  Move on to something else  Hey  I love the show  I guess it helps  If you can laugh  At yourself too  Cause guys  Oh yeah  I always laugh at myself  Did that come from  Getting teased growing up  And you had to learn  To fire back  Or you were a dead man  No just you know  Like to laugh  You know  I think people  That take themselves  A little too seriously  Need to turn up  To their sense of humor levels  I love the laugh  I mean I grew up  Watching Good Times  San Francisco  Happy movies  Laverne and Shirley  I love the laugh 
[03:07:00]  Red Fox  I just read his book  You know  Hilarious guy  But not a good business  It's another  There's an example  Of a guy  Who constantly  Made odd business decisions  He's like  Did nobody love you enough  To tell you not to invest  In a fucking car fur  On the outside of the car  He did  It looked cool  It was  Whatever it's called  It looked cool though  But put fur on the outside  Of your car  And he didn't consider  The fact that it would rain  And he lost a million dollars  Doing that  He wanted to make it a business  Instead of just for his own car  Hilarious  He was just one of those guys  He was a good guy  He gave out a lot of money  He was a generous dude  And he just 
[03:07:30]  Sanford's son was an amazing show  He needed a guy like you  In his life  Who's your favorite comic  If you had to pick one  That's a lot  That's a lot  In this world we live in  We don't have to just go with one anymore  There's just a lot  I mean Eddie Murphy  And Chris Rock  And Chris Tucker  And Cat Williams  And now Kevin Hart  And we got a new one  That we're working on  Gary Owens  Who's a white guy  Yeah he's from Peter  Yeah he's  So you know  It's a lot of comedians  But the good thing about comedy  Is there's different type of comedies 
[03:08:00]  Like I love the guy  Who does the redneck jokes  Jeff Foxworthy  Oh you love Foxworthy  Oh my god  It's funny  I like him  You know I like  Their style of comedy  I just love laughing  If you weren't a ball player  Or if you weren't an athlete  Would you want to be  An actor or a professional dancer  Or a comic  Like what would you  I would love to be an actor  I would love to be an actor  I would love to be an action star  One of those big  Yeah  Big strong  You know guys on TV  Who really didn't have to act  Just say  Like Carl Weathers  Yeah Carl Weathers 
[03:08:30]  And they just say  You know the one crazy line  That's going to make me a lot of money  I'll be back  Yeah yeah  Oh my god  He gets in the war  Yeah it's like one of those lines  That kind of sinks in  Like for Eastwood  It was go ahead  Make my day  For a Schwarzenegger  There's always that one  Hasta la vista  Yeah Arnold had quite a few  There's nothing worse  Than somebody trying to have  One of those lines  And it fails miserably  You know  Call me in an hour  You're like  Oh  Fail  Fail  Terrible  You say you have  A sense of humor  About yourself  Have you seen some of the parodies 
[03:09:00]  People have done of you  Of course  I remember one from  I think it was  Mad TV  Yeah  And they were doing  Your Icy Hot commercial  Doing a parody of it  I love it  It was hilarious man  And I actually  You know  Sometimes when I see comedians  I say hey  Talk about me  Oh yeah  Love it yeah  I love it  It's cool  I don't get mad  I like to laugh  You know who told me  To talk about them  I met  I was hosting the  Porn Awards in 2004  And Mike Tyson  Was on the expo floor  So we got introduced  Very very briefly  And he kept telling me  He's like go up  Tell everybody I'm a pimp  Tell everybody I'm a pimp  Talk about me tomorrow 
[03:09:30]  And I'm like  Alright Mike  Of course I didn't  Because  Why wouldn't you  Because he didn't show up  Yeah I'm not going to  Listen to Tyson  Oh yeah  You kind of yes  Somebody to death  When they're fucking  Have you met  He's a menacing guy  Even though he's a nice guy  Tyson  There's nothing scarier  Than a championship  Heavyweight fighter  There's a  I've met  I've met Tyson  And he's a great guy  I actually went to visit him  When he was incarcerated  Oh you did  Yeah I went to visit him  Man  You know he's always been  Very very hospitable  To me  You know  Great guy  Yeah he was pleasant  Both times I met him 
[03:10:00]  Nice guy  There's this air though  This  You kind of feel  With a guy like Tyson  Like there's not that  Professional amateur boundary  If I do something stupid  He's going to react  To me like a man  Yes  Not a detached  What are you going to be  Well exactly  A victim  What am I going to be  The fucking plaintiff  He's going to knock  I said he's going to  Knock you the fuck out  We all know that  There's a few guys  You just know  Exactly  That's hilarious  Chuck Liddell would do that  Chuck Liddell would  You know 
[03:10:30]  One wrong turn  I think we're scared  Of John Jones  Than fucking Chuck  For some reason  Because he's a younger guy  Man  Chuck  Chuck's a brawler  John could  John could throw some blows too  But Chuck's one of those guys  At the bar  Yeah Chuck looks like  He's a bar prop  No we're talking about  The guys that would just snap  Liddell would snap  In an instant  Liddell would lay like  A beer stein  Upside your head  And then just pound you  He alpha males you  When he talks to  But he doesn't mean to  Like he's a really nice dude  But he kind of just like  Leans in with his big barrel chest  And his fucking face  Is right by your ear  And you're like  People think he's menacing me 
[03:11:00]  But he's like  I really enjoyed you  And you're like  Well thanks  Don't forget about  How he breathes like a bull too  Yeah cause his nose  The whole time  A couple times  He came to the improv  One night with Dana  I was in L.A.  And he's fucking heckling me  I'm being heckled by Liddell  And you took it  What do you do  I laughed it off  Like a girl  I tee heat him  I didn't fucking  Well you should  Speaking of fighting  I just want to tell Shaq  I'm so glad I didn't  Knock on your door  We were on vacation  At the same time  You have no idea  Trust me  I know that  But you were down  In Turks and Caicos  This was about  Four or five years ago 
[03:11:30]  And me and my now wife  Were in a room  And someone was making  A lot of fucking noise  Upstairs  And I'm like  I'm gonna go up there  And say something  Turned out  To make a long story short  It was you  Upstairs  Was it me  Or the kids  You had everybody  Oh yeah  You had a lot of people  Down there  They pretty much had the  Sorry  No but I'm thinking  You know  I'm gonna be a man  And do the right thing  You were in Turks  What were you trying to do  Sleep  Well it was later at night  Go out  And then  I learned 
[03:12:00]  Through the week  That yeah  Shaq's staying right upstairs  And then you would  You know  I don't know  If you want to hear this  But this guy  Was beyond cool  To every freaking person  That came up to him  That week  Beyond cool  Yeah is that frustrating too  Like  Is there ever a place  Where people bother you  Where you're like  Look I know you're a fan  But right now  Come on  No not really  I just try to be  Like you know  Polite  Like you know  The other day  I was at  I was at  Fogo the Chow  You know  The place  Where they bring  The meat  So I'm eating  Is that Korean barbecue  No  It's like Brazilian  Yeah  With the paddle 
[03:12:30]  With the red  You don't go red  Ever do you  No I go green  You go green  The entire time  They will  Bring you all sorts of meat  Until you finally  Put that paddle to red  Until you ask for the ham  They get very pissy  If you ask for the ham  You have to  They never just bring the ham  Why would you go for the ham  Fucking ham is phenomenal  It's lovely  You got so much good stuff  Yes  Oh yeah  That stuff is fantastic  So I was eating  And the lady  Was like  In like mid-night  Can you take a picture  I was like  Not right now  I'm eating  But other than that  Like I'll either  I'll either say yes  Or I'll try to give you 
[03:13:00]  A polite no  I never understood  Like that's like  The hackiest thing  A fan can do  Is come up to somebody  While they're eating  It's like  Everyone knows  That's not the time  To do it  I was like  You want me to drop  The sausage  To take a picture  I'll drop the sausage  I don't think so  I don't think so lady  Yeah I'll ask anybody  But never while they're eating  It's like  Wait outside  If you want  Like make yourself inconvenienced  Stand there and wait  And then try to get somebody  Jimmy's the pro at that  Last time I went there  Last time I went there  I went with my cousins  And a couple uncles  And we all had  Shit stories the next day 
[03:13:30]  Well you're packing so much meat  Oh well  You're amazed  What your body can do  The next day  How do you know I was packing so much meat  When you're next to me  In the bathroom stall  One of my cousins  That's my nickname  I pack a lot of meat  I can eat  One of my cousins  I call him Red Paddle  Couldn't wait to call me  And tell me he shit  The whole way back home  On the Long Island Railroad  We were eating so much meat  You can't eat there every week  It's a pleasant story  But it is  A bunch of guys  We're late  There's one on 46th Street 
[03:14:00]  Called Plataforma  Which is really good  I think that's the one I went to  It's fucking fantastic  And we ate at them in Rio  You ever been to Rio?  Yes  They have  I mean  In between  Brothel breaks  You have to have food  And I would run to the  Brothel breaks  Can you define that thing?  Well  I would take a 100mg Viagra  And run into a place  Oh, brothel  Yeah, brothel  I really misbehaved  With a bunch of comedians  Yeah, a bunch of us went  And they were just laughing  At each other 
[03:14:30]  In their bathrobes  It was fun  With their hard-ons  Yeah, it was just a  Brothel place  Is that the place  You can get the regular massage  Or the home run  Oh, they didn't play  No, there was not  There was not even  The hint of massage  It was like  I like you  Because there was no  Language connection  Yeah, yeah, yeah  And it's weird  How you make out  With girls in that situation  Like I would  I was kissing  Prostitutes  Jesus  I don't say that  You know, proudly  But I just  I did  I don't know why  I'm talking about this  So  Dove products 
[03:15:00]  When you're done  You really want to  Scrub up  And then smell good afterwards  And I suggest  Dove  That body wash  That Shack  Is promoting  Be comfortable  In your own skin  Right  Is that kind of  The theme of it  Be comfortable  That's the slug line  Because it actually  Does smell  I like it  I really do  It's nice  It's really nice  What do they have  They have  Because we only got  The deodorant  And I think  The face and body wash  Do they have other stuff  They got shampoo  Yeah, they got all this  And creams and stuff like that  I've got shampoo 
[03:15:30]  And to toe  They got everything  What do you do  When you get a product  Pitched to you  Do you say  Alright, let me try this  For a week  And see if I like it  Well, if I've never  Tried it before  I would just be like  Nah, probably not  Like, for example  After my first championship  Wheaties contacted me  But  I told my  My manager  Who was my uncle  Uncle Mike  I was like  I'm  You know  Growing up in Newark  We couldn't afford Wheaties  But if you call  Frosted Flakes  Or Fruitful  Tell them  I want to be on the cover  So  He contacted them 
[03:16:00]  They weren't really doing it  Did he really call them?  No, he called them  But I was like  Well, no  We've never really done it before  But why wouldn't they do that?  So the second year  He was like  Hey, Wheaties  I want you again  I was like  Nah, man  Frosted Flakes  They don't even add the ones  Like Rice Krispies  Well, Fruit Loops  They wouldn't do it  So the third year  I was like  You know what  Forget all those people  Just call Corn Flakes  Yeah, yeah, yeah  So then  After the one in Miami  D-Wade had a deal with Wheaties  So  They put me and him on the cover  Isn't that weird?  Like what bad marketing by the company 
[03:16:30]  To not have you  On the cover eating wheat  Or I'm sorry  Or whatever  Frosted Flakes  Frosted Flakes  That's just dumb on their part  What if Fruit Loops gets Shaq  On their cereal boxes?  Everyone would be talking about that  Probably some dumb marketing executive  Well, technically  It could be  You know  It could be a fan of their Spurs  Who might not buy it  You know  Not realizing that  That's just great advertising  I remember my parents telling me  Like  Because I love Frosted Flakes  And it's like  Oh, I want Frosted Flakes  And they're like  We'll get Corn Flakes  You put a little sugar on it  It's the same thing  It's like  No  But it's not the same thing 
[03:17:00]  It's not  But like when you're growing up  Like how we grew up  Oh, it'll do  Believe me  Yeah, yeah  I got Frosted Flakes  Man  That's the best  I got one more basketball question  You think LeBron James  Is going to get it done?  Ever?  One day  Ever  I think it will  One day  You think it'll get it done  In Miami with Dwayne  And  And Bosh?  It's set up that way  It's set up that way  Well, obviously  But now all the  Other teams are catching up  And they're  They're getting their  Superstar team together  It took  It took Mike  How many years to get it?  I want to say  Six 
[03:17:30]  Did it take him six years?  Oh, yeah  Did he not get it  Until after Pippen was there  Or was Pippen always there?  No, I'm not sure  It took him six  He won eight  Eight years  Took me eight  Took you eight?  I couldn't believe you played  Nineteen years  I was like  Because I remember  When your career started  It's like  Jesus Christ  That was a 20 year run  So I mean  Hopefully  Hopefully he will get it  But, you know  The unfortunate thing  The greater you are  One is not enough  Like I can remember  Bust my ass  To get one  And then  Like they let me celebrate 
[03:18:00]  On the ESPN one day  And then  Could the Lakers  Become a dynasty  Could they get two?  I was like  Now you gotta  Yeah, so then you gotta get two  Oh, can they get three?  And then after we lost  The third one  The Lakers are terrible  Trade shack  Shack's too old  And then when I got one  You ever get frustrated  By the media?  Yeah  Does some of that stuff  Feed away at you?  Ever?  I only get frustrated  When the ones  That don't have  G14 classification  Speak  But I used it  To drive me  And I used it  To, you know  Motivate me 
[03:18:30]  So  What is G14 classification?  I mean again  For the listeners  I mean we know  But  I mean like  You know for me  Like if you  Never played  Then I don't know  How you can speak  On certain situations  That's all  I mean like  You know  Everyone has an opinion  I respect the opinion  But don't tell me  How to be a big man  When you're not a big man  But you would listen  Of Barkley saying it  Obviously  No not even Barkley  Oh really?  Oh because he never  Won a championship  No not only that  But because  I'm more classified  Than he is  Nice  I like that  So like 
[03:19:00]  You know like  For example  Bill Walton  Only had 6,000 points  Like he would say  Certain things  And I'd be like  How do you know Bill  I got 20,000 points  Already  You know what I'm saying  So  You know  My thing with  Bill was like  You know  We're both in the  Federal building  But you're on the  Low floor  And I'm up  You know  It's only  Two guys  That have more  Clearance than me  And that's  Kareem  And Wood  Chamberlain  Who else would you  Put in the top  Five centers  Of all time  Obviously Shaq

[03:49:30]  What's that  Yeah  Yeah  From when he was a kid  Watching his mom on the floor  She fell and hurt herself  And the guy was helping him up  Oh yeah  She's like  Chipper get out of those shrubs  Chipper  What are you doing in there Chipper  Stop tugging on that Chipper  And I would start talking  And go  Mom what are you doing  I've seen the man helping you  And she'd say  Chipper stop jibber jabbering  You're jibber jabbering  Chipper stop it  She would always say that to you  Yeah she'd say  Go over there  Go play in traffic or something  And what were you tugging on 
[03:50:00]  Nothing  I was just there  Watching my mother  Get picked up  Cause she fell on her back  Or something  And the guy was helping her  But you said  That she said  Stop tugging on that Chipper  Yeah she would say that  Pull your pants up  Quit tugging  Get out of the bushes Chipper  And don't you go  Jibber jabbering now  Did Jesse Dixon  Help her up  He made quite a bit of sport  Of me  A bit of sport  Jesse Dixon  Just tease him  Jesse Dixon  Tease him  And then fucks his mom  On the floor 
[03:50:30]  Yeah  It's a damaged womb  This is Opie and Anthony's  Worst of 2012  So far  And we got  Jay Moise  Jay  Gentlemen  It's  Actually it's Woody Allen  I was wondering if I  Can you talk to  Andrew Dice Clay  About  The scene that was  Shooting this morning  Traffic is backed up  I was wondering if Andrew  Was there  If I could just give him  A few notes  Andrew's taking a shit  Right now  And Dice ran out 
[03:51:00]  To take a dump  What a fucking  Bit killer  I know  I know  Sorry  Too bad Woody  You didn't want to talk  To Chip  Or Uncle Paul  You could have  Went for an hour  Yeah  That's kind of  Bad timing  I'm sorry about  The bad timing  Yeah  Anthony's taking a shit  I thought Anthony  Did the poop at work  He was one of those  Psychotic people  But let me tell you this  I like the Woody Allen  How come your name's  Not Jay  Less or something  Oh boy  Oh boy  Oh that's great  I'm glad  Chip  Chip  How are we doing 
[03:51:30]  On the sliced  Cucumbers  How come your name's  Woody Allen  And it's not  Linoleum Allen  Or something  I don't  You know it's funny  Because many flaws  You know  Linoleum goes on top  Of the wood  So I guess  It's implied  You know  Hey how come  You're Woody  Woody  You got a Woody  In your pants  Or something  Please I wish  And it was just  Like marrying my daughter  All my Woody  Sort of went out  With the linoleum  And the Edsel  For crying out loud  You know  Hey her name is 
[03:52:00]  Soon Ye  How come it's not  Soon Ye  Fucking double guns  Woody  That's what I  That's what I  Don't really  I don't really  Understand that one  You know  It's sort of  Went over my head  But only five  Six  So I guess  You know  That's sort of  Par for the course  You know  Yeah everything  Goes over your head  It's like you think  Birds are planes  Or something  Fucking kill this guy  Now I think  You're being literal  You know  I'm not even sure  Just Chip  Chip  He's  He's 
[03:52:30]  He's fantastic  Everything he says  Is  You know  Literal  It's not  Getting the nail  On the head  You know  Sort of birds  And planes  Going over my head  Of course  You know  It's really  Added a lot  To the set  You know  Sort of working  Craft service  And keeping traffic  Clear  But hopefully  Ready in front of it  You know  How come it's  Craft services  And not  Like go to cheese  Services  Or something 
[03:53:00]  Yo  I think  That one looks foul  If I'm not mistaken  What's this  Andrew does  Clay's been going  10-100  Since the dawn of man  You know  How long do we have to wait  For the dice man  To drop the juice  He said it was going to be  A quick fucking dump  He said he's going to slide out  He's in there  I guess  Dropping 200 pounds  Of duty  Or something  I don't know  You're not joking  Part of the  Chip  Part of the  That speaks exactly  My language  You know 
[03:53:30]  Dropping 200 pounds  Of duty  I got two DTH trainees  Just standing outside  His trailer  Ready to hear a flush  And doing the high sign  You know  Dropping a tooth  I think  What was that  Great  Here's something  What was that  Great  Chip  Chip  Chip  Chip  I heard the other day  Was it the one  Where I said  I shit so much  I should be a shit machine  Or something  No  But that was  That was 
[03:54:00]  Exactly  That was  Alien  How about  I cut such a big  Fart the other day  Everybody thought  The hurricanes  Were in town  Or something  Yes  That one  That was  The one  I really enjoyed  I looked at  My script supervisor  And I just  Nailed the impression  I made a motion  With my hand  Going to put that  Put that in the  Script someplace  So maybe  Louie could say it  That's not exactly  How Chip  Sometimes it's important  You let actors  Color outside the lines  You know  How come his name 
[03:54:30]  Is Louis C.K.  Hey what  He doesn't have  Any vowels in his name  What's he playing  Wheel of Fortune  Or something  You know  You're right  Chip  His last name  Has no vowels  Which I always thought  Was a bit presumptuous  You know  Department of Motor Vehicles  Man  Who gets to the end  Of the line  They thought  He'd made a mistake  You know  That's so weird  Period  In your last name  You know  Sure  They probably thought  He left the rest  Part blank  Well I 
[03:55:00]  You know  I just  I'll go back  To set  We spent  Sitting here all day  Waiting for the  Dice Man  To flush up  You know  Pour the potty  John  He's probably in there  Combing his  I'm sorry  I was just saying  That I went to the  Bathroom  After all that  Hot shower talk  We just had on the radio  So maybe he's not  Dumping  One of life's  Grand ironies  Anthony Coom 
[03:55:30]  You're doing the  Radio show  Across a room  Full of blacks  And negros  You know  Hey how come  It's an irony  What is your shirt  Wrinkled or something  Actually you know  This is linen  It does wrinkle  It's human  I like shooting  In Manhattan  It really keeps  On your toes  Fashion wise  You know  You don't want to  Be caught with  Corduroy pants  South of 14th street  You're one of those  Hipsters  But uh  The Dice Man  It's uh  Holding a production  You want to do  Talk to the 
[03:56:00]  Plot master  About having  New Mr. Magoo  Glasses  You know  Hey what  Mr. Magoo  What are you driving  Into the roller coaster  Or something  He might as well  That's right  He's killing us  Double guns  Jew boy  Alright well  Make sure you tell  The Dice Man  When he comes out  Of the toilet  You know  If he could just  Come to set  In his marks  And maybe  Stop screaming  Into his microphone  That's why we  Lost Vietnam  You know  Guys like him 
[03:56:30]  Screaming into  Walkie talkies  I think  If I had to  Put it best  The Dice Man  Would say  Oh  You know  Whatever that  Catchphrase is  That he has  There  You know  Just awesome  Yeah  It's fucking  Amazing  God bless you  I have to go  Right now  I just saw  A pedicab  Go by  I was half  My family  On size  Gotta make sure  I start taking  Them to work  Joe can be  Determined later  You know  Officially run out 
[03:57:00]  Of Woody Allen  Things to say  You know  It was great  Alright Woody  It was a pleasure  It was absolutely  A pleasure  Finally have you  On the show  We're waiting  For him on set  But he's done  Dropping his  Deuce  You know  Porta potty  And clean  You know  It's impossible  You hire a man  Give the second  Third  Fourth chance  At life  And he  Spends it  In a port  Potty  Call me  A goo  Whatever  That thing is  That he says  You know  But Chip  I'll see you  At the rap party  I'm very excited 
[03:57:30]  It's a rap party  What are we all  Going to be  Rapping or something  You hear what I  Said Sammy  Double gun  Baby  Never at a loss  For a track line  The Chip  Chipper  And I really  Enjoyed the  The man named  Chip  A rap party  What are we  Rapping a bunch  Of gifts  Or something  No  I'll fucking  Go all day  With this shit  I don't give a fuck  Chip let me  Take this call  And I'll get  Right back to you  Okay  What are you  Wrapping up  Or something  What  What are you  Bows  It's like a  Bows with you  Something  Woody  He's gone  Yeah 
[03:58:00]  SFPs  I might do  Like a thing  Called igloo  Melton  We rock so hard  We melt igloos  So hard  We're like a bunch  Of like big rocks  We rock so heavy 
[03:58:30]  Only the devil  I'll cliff  Oh yeah  Yeah  It gets worse  More of  Opin' Anthony's  Worst of 2012  So far  Coming up  It's Iraq  Hosting the worst  Of 2012  So far  For the Opin' Anthony  Show  In this segment  Right here  Franchise O&A  Makes its return  It's been a long  Long time  Since Franchise O&A  Has happened on this show  And this wasn't  Scheduled  This wasn't even  Something that they  Really planned  Like hey we want 
[03:59:00]  We'll book a guest  But we don't really  Want to talk to him  Tom Hiddleston  He's in the Avengers movie  He's in the Thor's movie  The Thor's  Well yeah no that's right  Because there's a new Thor  I think coming next year  Anyway he plays Loki  Thor's brother  And he's coming to the studio  And O&A didn't really think  That this was a big enough  Guest because we weren't  Going to talk to  Samuel Jackson  Or Scarlett Johansson  Or Robert Downey Jr  These are like  Oh Loki  And we're trying to tell him  He's the main villain  He's going to be huge  You need to talk to this guy 
[03:59:30]  It's a big deal  The Avengers is going  To be a big movie  Well Opie and Anthony  Didn't think so  So Sam and myself  Had to step in  And make everything  Go okay  With franchise O&A  And guess what  Avengers just broke  600 million dollars  Domestically  What do Opie and Anthony  Know  Here it is  Tom Hiddleston  On the worst of  Opie and Anthony  2012  So far  This is O&A's  Worst of 2012  So far  On the Opie and Anthony  Channel  How you doing  I'm great 
[04:00:00]  How are you doing  Very good  Monday morning in New York  Yes  You're a big  You're about to be  A massive blockbuster  Superhero villain  I guess again  I am  Yeah  It was  I mean  This is my day job  These days  Yes  I was  I played Loki in Thor  For anyone who saw  The Thor movie  Yeah sure  And Loki is Thor's  Younger brother  His adopted brother  Who sort of  Turns to the dark side  Once he finds out  The narrative  His life  His life has been  A lie  And in the Avengers 
[04:00:30]  I've come down to Earth  To subjugate the entire planet  Is it a nerve wracking or whatever  Trying to figure out the mythos  And get all this comic book information  Because the people who love the Avengers  Yeah  Are these comic book geeks  That know everything there is to know about the character  So when you have to explain the character  Like it's a pop quiz every time  It's almost like playing a real person  Like if you're playing a  I don't know  If I was playing  One of the kings of England 
[04:01:00]  Or if I was playing a political leader  I'd have to do a lot of work on  On that person's actual life  And the great thing about these comics  Is that there is  A mythology now  That goes back  40 or 50 years  And it's a kind of  Contemporary mythology  Which you can just  I mean it's an amazing thing  To have a day job  Where you get up in the morning  And you're like  Ah  I've got to go to work  I've got to read some comics  Yeah  You talk about the  Men who go mad with power  Was Hitler one of the inspirations  Behind the Loki  There is a moment  Which is quite  You know there's a moment  Where Loki is 
[04:01:30]  Is in Germany  Yeah  With a whole bunch of people  At his feet  My favorite scene in the film  Is it?  Oh yes  My goodness  Thank you very much  Yes  You know Captain America  Has a few things to say about  I think he says you know  Last time I was in Germany  And saw a guy standing up  About everybody else  Didn't work out  Something like that  Captain America  Always the party pooper  Now it was  I liked the movie  I was having a hard time  Because I was babysitting  My kid at the time  Trying to piece a lot of this together  I saw that there's going to be 
[04:02:00]  A Thor 2  And there's word of Avengers 2  And all that  So he'll be in Thor 2  I'm assuming  Certainly yeah  Avengers 2  Is that also on your plate  Do you make a return  Or do they go like Batman  With a new villain?  I  Do you know what?  I don't know  The guys at Marvel  Are so smart  Because  They  They  They employ a group of people  Who are literally  Their  Their job is to work out  How  The Marvel  Movie  The Marvel  Cinematic universe  Works together  Like a big jigsaw puzzle  So that 
[04:02:30]  Avengers 2  If there is one  And I don't know that there is  I'm sure they're planning it  But they haven't told me  Avengers 2  Will have to follow on  From the events  Of Iron Man 3  Thor 2  And Captain America 2  And I think  They're still working out  What Captain America 2 is yet  You know Thor 2  I haven't seen a script  For Thor 2  I think they have a story outline  Iron Man 3 goes into production  In a couple of weeks  So  You know it's like  They are  They are aligning  Their stars 
[04:03:00]  And  In many  In more ways than one  And I'll  I mean if I'm needed  I'll be there  But if I'm not  Then I won't  It's like the old Hollywood system  It's either  They  They  Marvel  They set out to do  This series of movies  Yeah  And  And they're signing  Actors  For these multiple picture deals  Yeah  You know it's like  It's you know  You think they're coming  Here they come  Down the red carpet  It's the Avengers here  To show everybody  Oh look  Here comes Loki  Watch out universe  He may have your number next 
[04:03:30]  You know what I mean  It's like  I mean  I'll be  Very funny  Go ahead  What were you saying  That's old school  Yeah  It is  It's very old school  Yeah  Yeah  Or if it was in  If it was  If it was in Britain  It would be like  And here we have the Avengers  The Avengers are  The crack team of superheroes  If you believe in superheroes  You want to believe in this team  Yeah  Iron Man 4  Captain America  And the Incredible Hulk  It's something that sounds more intelligent though  When it's done with a British accent 
[04:04:00]  It sounds like it's a more intellectual statement  Do you have a lot of British actors  At least in American TV now  Have been doing the American accent very well  Have you had much experience in doing American accents in your projects?  Well I played F. Scott Fitzgerald in Woody Allen's Midnight in Paris  I don't know if you saw that movie  No  Oh yes  But I guess he was American  Could you give us an example of what your American accent would sound like?  Well he's not here to perform  Well no  Like as Scott  No but he did that 1940s piece very well 
[04:04:30]  As Scott Fitzgerald it was more  I mean there was a particular way that they spoke back in the 1940s  It was with a particular rhythm  And it was you know  Like give me something to read  Like  That's incredible  I see you got a copy of the Daily News here  Wiped out  Three generations shouted a seven die on the way to family reunion  It's amazing  It blows my mind  How long does it take you to get that down?  That's so sweet of you guys to say  I've been  I'm like a geek about accents and dialects and voices  Ever since I can remember  I've always been doing impressions of people 
[04:05:00]  You know as a kid I used to do impressions of  I find it fascinating watching the news  I wasn't listening to the news  I was watching the way people spoke  American newscasts?  No no British newscasts  But also because you know  British as an English child  You know the movies that I watched were American  I grew up watching Superman  And Indiana Jones  And AT  So immediately  Like your ear is attuned to something  But you could ask me to do an Irish accent  Or a Scottish accent  I mean there are some accents I'm  I don't know  But it's just amazing 
[04:05:30]  It's a different person  When we're looking at you with that accent  Like I'm not good with voices  There's one  The only voice I do is Dice  Andrew Dice Clay  And it's like you know  This guy he sounds like a British actor  G-g-g-g-g-g  This girl she had a British accent  When she was looking at my ass  G-g-g-g-g-g-g  Like that's the only one that I do  The challenging thing that I find  Is to speak in a neutral American accent  In my own voice  So it's like  Who is Tom  Who is Tom 
[04:06:00]  If he's speaking in an American  I mean I can do a lot of character voices  But I find I try  I mean how does this sound  This is like trying to be me  But talking in an American dialect  It sounds pretty American  You're doing a good job with that  Good job  Not to like nasal  Because a lot of British actors  They kind of go to that place  Where they're like  It all comes through the nose  Because somehow like  British actors think  That Americans all talk through  Which is not true  It's not true  Do you do a Ronald Reagan?  Give me a Ronald Reagan quote  Like it goes like  It's like  Will  I don't recall 
[04:06:30]  Mr. Gorbachev  Tear down that wall  Something like that  I can't do a Reagan  Well we can't do a wall  Because if I've heard it  If I've heard it  I can do it  I see  You can't do it  I mean that was pretty spot on  My impression  It was  Yeah  I can't be best  What's that guy from  Cool Hand Luke  Who Nirvana used to use  No Guns N' Roses  Used at the beginning  Of Civil War  What we've got here is  Failure to communicate  I forgot his name 
[04:07:00]  Some man you just can't reach  Would you be up to  Talking to some of the audience?  Of course I would  Yeah  Alright let's go to  Let's go to this line here  Hello  You're on with Tom Hiddleston  Hey Tom  How you doing man?  Hey man I'm good  How are you?  Very good  I can't wait to see the movie  What is it?  Open Friday right?  Friday  Or possibly even Thursday night  Friday wide  Friday wide  Yeah  To see the movie  And as a little  I don't know  As a little kind of gesture  Because I hear the movie's very good 
[04:07:30]  I hear you're very good  And I'll let you in on something  Where's Hopi and Anthony by the way?  Where are Hopi and Anthony?  Where are they?  Here  Where are they?  They're right here  Yeah  Are they?  Are they really?  What is this?  Yes  Sorry we can prank calls  Time to time here  I apologize for that  Yeah  Anyway  Strange  What's the difference  Between working on a more dramatic film  Like that  Or the Woody Allen film  Versus a blockbuster  Like the Avengers 
[04:08:00]  It's funny  Because in a way  An actor's job is the same  Yeah  But isn't it more  Like I would assume the Avengers  Had a lot more green screen  A lot more sort of  So is that more difficult?  Well you know  There's a moment in War Horse  Where the character I play  Captain Nichols  Leads a cavalry charge  Across No Man's Land  There's a very big  Kind of moment  Where you see Nichols  See the guns  And the whole thing  Goes into slow motion  And he's being shot at  Inevitably on the day 
[04:08:30]  There were no guns  And there were no real bullets  And you know  Right  So I was looking at  The forest of trees  And I had to imagine  The guns and the soldiers  And the bullets  And that's just like  Playing Loki in the Avengers  And imagining  That Manhattan is falling apart  And imagining  That the Hulk is there  Screaming in my face  I'm getting the sign here  That he has to go  You're doing TV  And some other press here  Real quick  My favorite scene  Without giving anything away  You and the Hulk  It's a big showdown  Yes  But it was probably 
[04:09:00]  The best scene in the movie  At least for me  Thank you very much  The Avengers this Friday  Thank you so much  For coming in  Thank you guys  Thank you sir  Such a pleasure  The worst is yet to come  This is ONA's worst of 2012  So far  On the Opie and Anthony channel  My name is Erock  Hosting the worst of 2012  So far for the Opie and Anthony show  This segment  Ricky Gervais is back  It's been a while  Since he's been on the show  We love when he's on the show  He seems to only do our show 
[04:09:30]  Around here  I'm not complaining  It's a little curious  But whatever  We get the exclusives  And we get all the good stuff  From Ricky Gervais  He's in studio  Joe DeRosa also happens  To be in studio  And we bring up  Time to time  Well all the time now  With Joe DeRosa  That he likes  Bailey J  Who I forget the term  That they use now  But transgender  They don't like me calling  Tranny  But it's a girl  With a dick  Anyway we bring this up  All the time  With Joe DeRosa  And we talk about 
[04:10:00]  Bailey J  And Buck Angel  Buck Angel is the reverse  It's a dude  With a vagina  And who would you  Rather sleep with  Or fuck  Or whatever you want  To call it  Bailey J  Or Buck Angel  And everyone has  Their own answer  It's a very difficult  Topic to discuss  We ask Ricky Gervais  And we find out  It's probably the most  Unanswerable question  In human history  Here it is  This is Opie and Anthony's  Worst of 2012  So far  We should ask Kim  We should ask Kim  The question we were 
[04:10:30]  Trying to figure out  I know I just thought  And this would be  Perfect for Carl actually  Yeah  You want to explain  Really fast  So there's a  Transsexual  Oh  Oh that question  Yeah  There's a transsexual  Woman  Used to be a guy  Now she's a girl  With a cock  Named Bailey J  I don't have a thing  For transsexuals  But there's something  About her  I find her  Incredibly attractive  Get in the balls  I know  Go to the one  Diana 
[04:11:00]  There's something  About her  You know there's something  About you that's so  Different  It's like  It's like  I'm tired of these  Girls with vaginas  I need something  These vagina girls  As I call them  But you honey  You've got something  You've got something  Special  It's a challenge  Can I just say  I'm not laughing  At this person  Don't worry  I'm laughing  At his obsession 
[04:11:30]  We've been laughing  At him for a while  About this thing  We'll all be apologizing  So she's got  A polar opposite  Now  Named Buck Angel  Now this is Buck Angel  And he's a man  But Buck was born  A woman  And still has  Complete women parts  Vagina  Everything  That's a woman  And tattoos  But he still has  His vagina  She was born  She was a model  Even  Do you have  A vagina picture  Of Buck Angel  I know  I did  I'm sorry  It's fine
