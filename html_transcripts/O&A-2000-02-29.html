<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a heated segment about weight and body image.  A caller, Emily, confronted the hosts about their frequent fat jokes, sparking a contentious discussion with numerous offensive comments from both the hosts and several callers, including Mike, who made extremely vulgar remarks about overweight women.  Another caller, Danny, contributed by discussing his marriage to a woman with a "big butt."  The hosts, while defending their humor as indiscriminate, involved Emily's 17-year-old daughter, Clara, in the conversation, further escalating the crude commentary.  The segment transitioned into a discussion of their attendance at a WWE Raw event, their interactions with wrestlers, listener-made signs, and their initial impressions of Ron and Fez's new radio show.  The discussion circled back to weight and body image before moving on.

Next, the hosts recounted their ill-fated attempt to disrupt a taping of *Late Show with David Letterman* featuring Kathie Lee Gifford.  Fueled by alcohol, they, along with Butch, implemented a listener-suggested plan to throw a bra at Gifford, leading to Butch rushing the stage, shouting "Radio chick rules," and a physical altercation with security.  The hosts were detained and questioned, with the incident gaining unexpected notoriety, even appearing in *Time* magazine (without naming them). A source suggested the incident may have contributed to Gifford leaving her show.  The segment continued with listener calls, including a prank call to Alan Smith's show, celebrity gossip (Pamela Anderson and Tommy Lee, Celine Dion suing the *National Enquirer*), and a call from Tom Green promoting a show featuring Monica Lewinsky.  Andrew Dice Clay made a surprise appearance during the Tom Green call. Rockaway Bedding advertisements were also aired.

The following segment featured another call from Tom Green and a discussion of the show's "Lesbian for a Day" segment. A caller, Karen, who lacked a sense of smell, expressed interest in participating.  Further calls followed, including one detailing a three-way encounter.  The segment included discussions about Daryl Strawberry, Kathy Lee Gifford’s departure, and Anna Kournikova's marriage, interspersed with Stacker 2 advertisements and Dope music.  Numerous sexually explicit and offensive jokes were made throughout.

A recurring theme of "wowing" (flashing) on live television, along with updates on Karen's search for a lesbian partner, and a game to guess Anthony's preferred concert tickets, dominated the next portion. Callers shared their "wowing" experiences, and one caller described being caught having sex in a movie theater.  The hosts also discussed listener-submitted videos of large "wow" signs featured on a local news broadcast.  The search for a partner for Karen involved testing her lack of smell by having her sniff the hosts' body parts.  A caller ultimately volunteered to meet Karen, describing a recent lesbian encounter.  The concert ticket game concluded with the revelation of Anthony’s musical preferences and the awarding of wrestling tickets.

The final segment began with a caller, Sarah, detailing her oral sex techniques and dissatisfaction with her boyfriend's reaction.  The hosts provided humorous and sexually explicit advice. The discussion then shifted to a report about bootlegged show CDs being sold on eBay, followed by a caller, Marilyn, offering advice on oral sex.  The hosts also addressed the unauthorized sale of their merchandise on eBay.  The show culminated in a "Lesbian for a Day" segment featuring Galaxia and Karen, who became completely topless and engaged in explicit sexual acts on a studio couch, with a caller, Paul, participating via phone. The segment concluded abruptly due to time constraints, with the promise of the recording being released online.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Hello?  Yeah, I thought I'd check a little intelligence for this conversation here.  Yeah, there's no place on this show.  I know that.  Opie and Anthony.  More stupidity on the way.  1027 WNEW.  It is Opie and Anthony.  Hello, how are you guys?  Thanks for joining us.  There you go.  All right, let's go to the phone and talk to a few people here.  Emily!  Good afternoon.  Hi, Emily.  How are you?  Hello, Emily.  What's going on? 
[00:00:30]  Well, I heard your bit last night about Star Jones and the fat lady during the halftime show.  And when you talk about black people, when you talk about gay people, I never get the sense that you dislike them.  I know you guys are not a racist, but when you talk about fat people, whoa.  I mean, I heard the disgust in Anthony's voice, and I'm a big person.  Hopefully not for long.  Well, how fat of a broad are you?  Okay, I am 5'3". 
[00:01:00]  Two bills.  Two bills.  Two bills, no doubt.  All right, let me explain the fat thing.  Yes.  Explain it to me.  Let me, there's a reason why they're fat.  There's two types of fat people, okay?  Okay.  There are fat people that really, really, truly can't help it.  Yes, that's true.  It's in their genetics.  It's hereditary.  It's all that.  I truly believe that, okay?  Yeah.  And then there are fat people that are just slobs and don't want to take care of themselves  and eat themselves into oblivion and gain an S-load of weight. 
[00:01:30]  Which one are you?  Well, maybe they can't help themselves either.  Well, you know, it was funny.  I saw last night on the news, speaking about the radiation thing up there at the nuclear  power plant.  They went into a bar.  There's a guy that must own this bar.  Swear to God, had to be 400 pounds.  He's talking about...  You know, an earlier warning would have been nice about this nuclear steam being released. 
[00:02:00]  I didn't know until hours later this could be a health concern.  Health concern?  I'm like, dude, I'm looking at the screen going, dude, never mind the radiation.  How about your cholesterol?  Right.  Put down the hamburger and the fries.  That's a health concern at this moment in your life.  Yeah.  That's true.  I don't know.  That's why I'm losing weight.  But, hey, there's got to be a reason why they say the bigger the cushion, the better the  push-up.  Well, that's...  Oh, the big people say that.  Well, do you...  No, actually, a skinny person told me that many years ago.  Chubby chaser. 
[00:02:30]  That's a fetish, like being dumped on.  I don't mind fat ladies because they give the best Hummers because they have to try harder.  Well, no, we...  Why are you losing weight?  The other thing's just as well, too.  I've got to ask you something.  Why are you losing weight?  Why am I losing weight for my health?  Because I want to be around for my kids' kids and I want to grow old with my husband.  Now, not to look better?  That's...  You know what?  When you...  Wait a minute.  That's a side effect.  All right, side effect.  When you lose weight and people start coming up to you and go, wow, you look great, you're  not going to feel good about that?  Yeah, I do. 
[00:03:00]  I do.  I was much bigger.  Much, much bigger.  Oh, my God, really?  Yeah.  Good job of the hut.  Is it in your family?  Yeah, well, darn near.  Is it in your family or you just can't put down the 20s?  To tell you the truth, I don't know about my genetics because I'm adopted.  Uh-huh.  Ah, that's fine.  I have no idea whether it's a genetic thing.  Well, do you eat a lot?  I swallowed a lot of anger, along with a lot of pepperoni pizzas.  It was, yeah, it was some overeating and mostly not exercising.  Really?  Eating and no exercising.  Exactly.  And you got fat.  Go figure that one out.  Yeah, well. 
[00:03:30]  And have you always been a little chubbette when you were a kid, growing up?  Pretty much, yeah.  Yeah?  I saw my daughter laughing in the background.  I'm going to kill her.  Now, what's the problem with us?  Is your daughter a little pudge?  What?  Excuse me?  Is your daughter a little pudge?  I don't want to bring her into that.  Well, let me tell you.  Whether you do or not, you better go.  She's listening right now.  Get her on the right path.  Get her on a diet.  Believe me, believe me, we are.  You know something?  Because there's nothing worse than seeing a couple of fat parents with fat kids. 
[00:04:00]  Because you know something?  But you know what?  It's not for long.  Not for long.  Well, let me tell you.  You've got to get your kids on the right path because it's pathetic.  All of a sudden, there's a fat kid and then the parent-teacher conference.  And everyone's like, look at the fat parents.  The fat kids.  A big family of weebles walking into the school.  And it's embarrassing for the kid.  Okay, but let me ask you a question.  Why?  You know, I don't get that angry tone in your voice when you're talking about it.  Well, because black people can beat us up.  We can run away from fat people.  That's pretty much it. 
[00:04:30]  That is the prime reason.  We know we're pretty safe.  We're frightened of the blacks.  Not all the time.  But you know what?  We know we're safe when we're talking about the blind or fat people.  Because they can't catch us.  Oh, okay.  That's your reason.  It's cool with the blind people.  Where you just be quiet and watch them walk around.  We've had people listen to you guys.  We want to know that we're loved, too.  Of course.  You're just sitting there all day.  Emily, I'm...  All right, look.  Emily...  All right, you're going to get a big S-U from this.  Emily, I believe it's in your head. 
[00:05:00]  It's your insecurities.  Because Ant and I, we really try to make fun of everything.  Whether you think it's right or wrong, that's what we like to do on this show.  Yeah, I know.  My daughter and I were laughing our asses off, too, when you were talking about Star Jones.  Yeah, let me tell you about Star Jones.  And the reason that I sound disgusted and I'm pissed off at her, is it just because she's overweight?  Because she's fatty?  No.  She tries to come off like a diva.  She's calling herself a frigging diva. 
[00:05:30]  Why is that such a bad thing?  Because she's not.  Let's call a spade a spade.  And that's not a racist comment.  Literally.  Not a racial reference?  No.  She is big.  She is fat.  But she's secure about herself.  But you know something?  But don't try to facet down her throat.  She's a diva.  That's everybody kissing her big, fat, black ass, saying she's a diva.  And then, what?  When they turn around.  You think when she's not in the room, they're all like, isn't Star beautiful?  No, they're talking about what a big, fatso she is. 
[00:06:00]  And how she can't get away from the buffet table.  But she loves herself.  I mean, how many skinny girls are in L's?  How do you know she loves herself?  How do you know she loves herself?  She could be putting on a front.  And then at home, she could be crying over her yodels.  That could be true.  She could be putting on a brave front.  But how many beautiful, wonderful, skinny girls that come into your studio and wow you  go home and cry themselves to sleep because they think they're ugly?  Yeah. 
[00:06:30]  I don't know.  You make a great point there.  All I'm saying is, you know, people are full of crap when they turn around and people  like Star Jones, self-proclaimed diva, when anybody who looks at her just goes, they don't  go, oh my God, on the outside.  And I'm just saying this, yeah, this is purely on the outside thing.  I'm not talking about a personality.  I'm not talking about anything.  I'm just talking about when you look at somebody right on the outset when you see them the first  time, they're not going, what a beautiful diva.  They're going, holy crap, look at that ass like a truck. 
[00:07:00]  But not everybody.  Maybe that's your opinion, but I'm sure it's not everybody.  I don't know, man.  That's a lot of woman.  Yeah, I know.  That's a lot of woman, but...  When was the last time she saw her patch?  And all fat people are so funny.  They're all, not all, okay, then if people call and say you said all, a lot of overweight  people are always saying, oh, accept us the way we are, we're great inside, this is how 
[00:07:30]  we are, but what are they all trying to do?  Lose the weight.  None of them.  And if one out of a million...  Is this Scar Jones trying to lose weight?  That's another thing.  Yeah, she's always talking about losing weight.  She never does.  But I mean, if they finally do lose weight, then they go on the, get on their high horse  and start talking about how all fat people got to lose weight.  They're like recovered alcoholics or smokers.  You can't shut them up.  You know, we could ask the question today to our listeners.  What's the first thing they think?  What, shaved or bush? 
[00:08:00]  What's the first thing they think?  I wish I'd have gotten in on that contest, but I don't think my kids would have approved.  No, they have to answer the phone too, honey.  Okay, let's ask this question to the listeners today.  What's the first thing they think of when they see a fat person?  Knowing the listeners, I know what their first response is going to be.  What'll it be?  It's going to be, look what a fat ass she's got.  I know it.  I get that response too.  On line eight, Mike has a little compassion.  Let's get him on the conversation.  Mike.  How you doing, Owen?  Hello, Mike. 
[00:08:30]  Listen, you fat slob.  Men hate fat women.  The sweat in between the rolls.  The more pushing, better cushion.  It's like a wet and wild ride.  You get on top, you don't know where you're going to end.  You need a little flour to find a hole.  I mean, what's going on over here with you?  Wow, I thought that was going to be a compassionate call.  Compassionate.  Are you kidding me?  I see her in a Toyota.  She's almost on two wheels.  No, that's not me.  I mean, this is why we're slipping and sliding in the snow, because she's sliding all around, 
[00:09:00]  because she's so fat.  Oh, my God.  She sounds like a nice person, Mike.  Emily, I apologize.  It says on the screen, Mike loves fat bitches.  Yeah, I love them so much, they should be eliminated.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Come on.  Okay.  Oh, okay.  Oh, okay.  I'm sure you can't pinch an inch off of him.  Huh?  I'm sure you can't pinch an inch off of him.  Yeah, who's he?  Oh, what's that? 
[00:09:30]  Yes.  As we descend with the bats, we see the blue air.  Emily, what are they saying?  I'm getting the abuse here.  What are they saying, Emily?  Hello?  What is that?  Uh-oh, my daughter's getting very mad with you guys.  Why?  Why?  She's listening on the other end.  How old is your daughter?  She's 17.  And how much does she weigh?  Uh, to tell you the truth, I don't know.  She's not skinny.  We're not built that way. 
[00:10:00]  You know something?  You can be.  We're not built that way.  I swear to God.  You can be.  You can't believe.  Oh, please, please, I do not do Richard Simmons.  God, I hate him.  Emily, Emily, you can lose the weight, Emily.  Emily, listen to this flaming fag, Emily.  You can steal a meal.  Try my spray.  Oh, I love it.  It comes in a pop dispenser, my spray, for all the men out there. 
[00:10:30]  You spray it on your salad, and then I toss it.  Okay.  It's sweating to the oldies.  Emily, lose the weight.  All right, line three swears he loves fat chicks.  Mike.  Yeah, what's up?  Mike again.  Hey, another Mike.  Another Mike.  Mike, you're on with Emily.  What's up?  I love fat chicks.  All right.  Yeah, absolutely.  Okay, let me let butt out.  Butt?  No, no butt.  He likes the butts, the bellies, everything.  That's what he means, no butt.  No fat chicks. 
[00:11:00]  No, the chicks, the butt, I love it all.  Oh, my God.  Wait.  What's going on?  Joy Brown, speaking of fat people, has this guy that has to be 800 pounds on a couch in her studio right now.  Dude, is that a guy or a chick with a beard?  I'm serious.  800 pounds is too big.  800 pounds.  See for yourself, Joy Brown.  That's what we don't like, Emily.  It gets to that point.  But that's not all of us.  Are you going to lay in bed and eat until they've got to pull you out with something they load small mammals with? 
[00:11:30]  Large mammals?  No.  Oh, look at the audience clapping.  He's an inspiration to us all.  It's okay.  He's losing the weight.  Oh, my God.  Oh, look.  There's a big fat kid.  Fat kid on Joy Brown up next.  Fat kid to be mocked.  You know what happens to fat kids in the playground?  They get beat up.  Nobody plays with them.  And you know.  Hello.  Hello.  Emily.  You know what's going to happen?  Your daughter's 17. 
[00:12:00]  You know how many good years she's got left?  She's only got a few good years left as far as young high school banging goes.  She's not going to get.  She's going to be going to the prom, right?  Emily.  Let's hope so.  Okay.  Do you want her to go into a prom dress, all fat, with the tops of her feet looking like  she's baking bread?  Excuse me.  I didn't say she was fat.  I didn't say she was fat.  She's obviously overweight, Emily. 
[00:12:30]  Now, what are you saying?  Well, yeah.  You're talking about it.  You said it.  You said we're not skinny people.  No, no, no.  I said we're not built that way.  We're not tall, thin, leggy.  We're short.  You know, we're short.  You're built like a pear or a weevil.  No, no.  Emily, have you taught your daughter about bulimia?  Excuse me?  That might work.  You know?  I think that...  Wait, Chris has some advice for you on line nine. 
[00:13:00]  Chris!  Yeah, what's going on, guys?  Hey, you got some advice for Emily?  Wait, she's short?  Let me guess.  She's five foot all around?  I just want to come up to some of those people I see on the street and just slap some  donuts out of them.  Well, that's not nice, Emily.  You're a nice guy, too.  That's not nice.  I don't care.  I just cannot stand fat.  People are going around and taking up all the spaces on the bus.  Yeah, that's a big issue.  That and the train, too.  I go up at school, I try to go into the buffet lounge, get something to eat, and they're  just slowly moving aside, getting fatter as they walk.  Well, that's some real encouragement. 
[00:13:30]  That's really encouraging.  It should encourage people to maybe lose a little weight.  That's all.  Yeah.  That's all, Emily.  We got rid of him.  Let's go to Danny.  Danny married a fat pig.  How are you doing?  Danny, you married to a fat pig?  Well, no, she's not a fat pig, but she's got a big butt.  Big butt?  Very big butt.  She'll move you on it.  Really?  Yeah.  Was she that way when you got married?  No, I mean, yeah, she was, but she, you know, you kind of get used to it after a while.  She's kind of soft and everything like that. 
[00:14:00]  You, like, move into it like a big pillow.  You ever yearn for the skinny ass, Danny?  Oh, absolutely.  You look at the chicks with the skinny little ass and you go like, God damn, what the hell?  I, I, I, I, I gotta, I gotta hop in the sack with the, this thing, her ass looks like a big sack of onions.  Can I, can I ask Danny a question?  Yeah, go ahead.  Danny, do you rag on your wife?  No, not at all.  I mean, she's, she's great.  Not to her face.  Not to her face. 
[00:14:30]  No, definitely not.  See?  Oh, there you go.  Thank you.  No, I really don't.  I love it at death.  It doesn't matter to me.  You really don't.  But it's cool, though.  We have a lot of fun.  Yeah, Danny, it doesn't matter.  You're right until you're out, maybe, at a strip club.  Until you're out at a strip club and you're looking at one of those asses.  You know, the, the, the way an ass is supposed to look.  He loves his wife.  No big deal, though, man.  I, I, I, I, I gotta hang with it.  It's all right.  All right, Danny.  All right, syndication now.  Thank you.  Danny.  All right, bro.  Danny's married to a fat chick and he doesn't mind. 
[00:15:00]  I can't, hey, Danny.  Dan, uh, he hung on.  He hung on.  I wanted to know if he married her fat or if she got fat.  Oh, didn't you ask that already?  Yeah, he said she was a little chunky.  Oh.  Uh, George, what's up?  Hey.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, you're talking to Emily.  Uh, first time, huh?  You're talking to Emily.  Let's go.  Emily, what's up?  Hey, uh, who's going to make the kid's prom dress?  Omar the tent maker or what?  Oh.  Jesus Christ.  I won't even dignify that with a response.  Very good, Emily. 
[00:15:30]  All right, no, I just busted shots.  No, hey, hey, listen, listen.  I was about 128 pounds when I was going in.  My problem is that she was about 160, but I...  All right, your phone sucks.  Oh, my God.  All right, Emily.  I don't know what else to tell you.  Well, I...  I hope our audience didn't insult you too much.  Like I said, that was...  Well, that's what...  That's to be expected.  That's reality, though.  That's how people feel, though.  That's how a lot of people feel.  And I understand that.  I mean, there are people that, you know, enjoy, you know, larger women. 
[00:16:00]  That's fine.  I personally don't like it.  It's like a freak show thing, though.  Come on.  See, now my daughter's all insulted over what they said about her prom dress, and it's  not even like that.  Put that 17-year-old piece of ass on the phone.  Excuse me.  Go ahead.  You do it.  Hold on a second.  Put her on the phone.  Uh-huh.  I'll bang the fat right out of that ass.  Jackhammer.  She'll be sweating.  Hey, then. 
[00:16:30]  She'll be sweating like Tyson's date.  Huh?  Are you going to be his?  Yeah.  I bet you are.  What's the lovely daughter's name?  Her name is Clara.  Bella.  Clara?  What are you...  What are you...  An abusive parent?  You even name them after cows?  Who the hell is...  Hey, wait.  Wait.  Hey, Emily.  What?  What family member was named Clara that you had to...  to name your kid Clara?  My stepmother's sister.  I knew it had to be somebody.  What?  What is she got? 
[00:17:00]  Nude pictures of you?  Why would you name a kid in this day and age Clara?  Hello.  First of all, it wasn't my decision.  It was my husband's decision, and her name is Clara Jessica.  So everyone calls her Jess or Jessica?  Or CJ.  CJ.  Why would you give someone a name where...  Just like CJ from Baywatch, I'm sure.  Why would you give someone a name where they automatically...  have to come up with another name so they don't have to use the real name?  Most people call her Clara.  Nobody's ever tried to...  Clara? 
[00:17:30]  That sounds like that Mayberry...  Isn't that the operator?  Clara?  Put me through the barney.  Watch it, guys.  You're dating yourself.  Oh, please.  We've told everyone how old we are.  We're in our 30s.  Dating ourselves what?  They don't show Andy Griffith on TV anymore?  Well, yeah, I'm sure.  Not that we watch it.  No, you just stopped at the Drake's commercials.  Are we done with Emily?  I want to talk to the daughter, man.  This hate in your voice, Anthony, is like so disturbing.  What did we ever do to you?  Huh?  This hate in your voice is like really disturbing. 
[00:18:00]  What did some fat person ever do to you?  Did they kill your pet or something?  Let me think back.  Hmm.  You obstruct my view of the skinny chicks.  Put that daughter on the phone.  Hold on.  She needs a tongue lashing.  Let's play and make Clara cry.  Hello?  Hey, Clara.  Uh-huh.  How you doing?  I'm fine.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Are you hot?  What do you mean am I hot? 
[00:18:30]  You got a nice body?  You sound hot.  I got big boobs.  Well, that's good.  The problem is you got an ass to match, right?  How big are your boobs?  I don't know.  Can I say how big my boobs are?  She's got to ask her mom's permission.  Right out of permission.  This ain't a field trip, honey.  It's the 38C.  38C?  Mm-hmm.  Maybe he's got a little bad.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's a little bit of bad.  When you're 38, it should be a D cup.  Yeah.  That's okay, though.  You going to the prom?  Yeah, I think so. 
[00:19:00]  You got a date?  Yeah, I do.  Oh, your dad's not busy that night?  Are you going to give him some action?  No.  You're not going to give him action?  Every guy wants action on their prom date.  I'm not like that.  I'm doing your prom, not my senior prom.  Are you going to drop some tonnage before the prom?  I've already lost some weight.  Why?  You have?  Yeah.  How much and how many pounds?  I don't know exactly, but I went down like three sizes.  Three sizes?  How much do you weigh?  I don't know. 
[00:19:30]  Honestly, I don't know.  Take the ballpark guess.  I don't know.  You weigh as much as a ballpark?  No, ballpark guess.  Go on.  What?  Ballpark guess.  How much?  Park guess?  A hundred and fifty?  A hundred and forty, maybe?  One forty?  Mm-hmm.  And how tall are you?  And how tall are you?  I'm five one.  Okay.  Five one?  Okay.  All right.  Now, you know, that's not that bad.  She's not like, she walks down the street and you go, oh my God.  No, I'm a size ten.  I mean, I'm not, I'm a little chubby, but it's not.  You got any cottage cheese happening on that ass? 
[00:20:00]  Oh, no, no.  Tell me the truth.  That's disgusting, no.  Are you going to watch your eating from now on, knowing that you can be as big as your mom?  Yeah, I am.  I mean, you're in danger of doing that, you know.  Yeah.  Oh, I know.  I've been told.  You don't eat a lot of desserts and stuff, do you?  No.  No.  Want to play, uh, What's in My Pants?  No, I don't.  No, no, I don't.  That's terrible.  All right.  We're just messing with you.  You sound like a cool little girl there.  We're going to try to make you cry, but, uh, obviously you're, uh, very giggly. 
[00:20:30]  No, I'm not going to let you guys bring me down.  Hey, I like that.  Is that a challenge?  Yeah.  No, it's not a challenge.  Okay.  We'll break out the heavy, uh, heavy equipment here.  I know you will.  Don't worry about it.  We love a good challenge.  I know.  I've heard your show before.  No, I think you're pretty cool.  We're just messing with you.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Use a condom on your prom night there.  Okay.  Did I put my mom on?  That lucky guy.  Yeah, I guess.  All right. 
[00:21:00]  Going to keep banging that big fat one.  All right.  I was like, what?  You're so mean.  I'm fantasizing.  All right.  All right.  Bye.  Smack that.  Smack that ass.  Yeah.  Bye, Clara.  Big red handprint on a big white ass.  No, she's not white.  What?  She's not white.  She's black?  No.  What is she?  We're Hispanic.  Oh, nice.  You don't sound it.  Well, neither does Rick.  Huh?  Yeah.  Neither does Rick.  So you're a sort of Recan? 
[00:21:30]  No, I am a New Year Recan.  Hmm.  All right.  Well, you guys sound pretty cool.  Yeah, well, maybe.  Well, now that she's got an excuse for the big ass.  Probably got 100 pounds just in that ass alone.  What do you want us to do when we lose our weight, go down, and wow you, or what?  God, now that I made that father joke, it doesn't apply to the Hispanic.  Do you have big boobs like your daughter?  Where do you think she comes from?  I only got fattened about 80 times for the past half hour.  I'd check out your boobs. 
[00:22:00]  Yeah.  Wow.  I like the big boobs.  I know you do.  Are they all flat on top and stuff?  Well, no.  Unfortunately, gravity has taken a little.  Oh, boy.  What earths are your own?  Well, that's a little gravity joke.  Come on.  Hey, you offered to pay for many.  Come on.  Look, it shows I know about mass and density.  Well, what's your size?  38 long, 38 double D.  What are you sporting?  I'm sporting a 40 D right now.  40 D, huh? 
[00:22:30]  Right now.  What does it change?  Well, I told you I'm losing weight.  Don't lose them in those.  I'm a 44 double D.  That's cool.  When you get down to about 110 pounds, fly in here and see us.  A big gust and open up your bat wings.  You know what?  Hey, Emily.  I don't know if I'll ever get down to that way.  Like I said, we're not built that way.  I've always been a chubby little girl.  Hey, Emily.  Mm-hmm.  What do you have between your breasts that your daughter doesn't?  It's not my navel.  It's not their navel. 
[00:23:00]  I listen to you guys.  Yeah, maybe a little too closely.  I am a faithful listener.  All right, we don't want to piss off our faithful listeners.  That isn't the answer.  Yeah, that's why I'm wondering.  Why do you hate us fat people?  We love your show.  Honestly, we've got to move on.  Let's wrap it up by saying, honestly, we just make fun of everything.  I know.  Whether it's right or wrong, and we don't really care.  See, I hate putting a face to the fat, because now I kind of like you.  Oh, thank you.  I like you, too.  I was hoping not to.  Even though you're so bitter, but.  I like you.  No, we're fine.  I'm not bitter, you pig. 
[00:23:30]  All right, Emily.  Hey, Anthony, now that you're available, maybe you should try a chubby check.  Yeah?  Yeah, maybe.  Like getting that, eh, shoot a tray up in that piece.  They do try harder, eh?  You got a two-by-six I could strap to my ass?  Perhaps?  Honestly, you don't know what you're missing.  Really?  I've done a couple chubs.  You guys are fun.  Yeah.  You guys definitely try harder.  If you get a chubby check, that you're not.  Just got to make sure you have a blindfold on, but, you know.  Oh, nice.  Oh.  You are just so nice.  I love you guys anyway. 
[00:24:00]  All right.  So my daughter said thanks for talking to her.  She loves O&A.  You guys suck.  We like her.  You know, make sure she knows.  She rules.  She was cool.  All right, Emily?  Don't I rule, too?  Yeah.  If you show your boobs, you will.  Excuse me?  Come by and show us your boobs.  We'll see.  All right, Emily.  You guys take care.  Bye.  Bye.  There she goes, Emily.  Wow.  Look at that.  The chubby family.  Little chubby family right there.  The chubsters.  Living in a chubby little house, in a chubby little bed, in a chubby little car. 
[00:24:30]  It's the chubby family.  Opie and Anthony.  Yeah.  Can we get these illiterates off the air, please?  Please suck.  If I wasn't on it, I wouldn't listen.  1027 WNEW.  More of your phone calls in just a bit here.  It's the Opie and Anthony show for Tuesday.  February 29th.  Here's Dan Zick.  1027 WNEW.  Two songs.  We'll be back.  Stay there.  Opie and Anthony.  There's no level 2-0 that you guys won't stick to. 
[00:25:00]  That's right.  Yeah.  1027 WNEW.  Ah, yes.  We are back.  Quick musical break there.  Another track from Californication.  Other side for the Red Hot Chili Peppers.  Dan Zick in there.  Mother.  Love Dan Zick.  It's the O&A show.  What's happening, man?  It's Tuesday.  How you doing?  I'm doing great, Anthony.  How are you?  Good.  Very good.  I'm hungry, though. 
[00:25:30]  Yeah, I'm really hungry, too.  I think someone's got to get us lunch.  I didn't eat much.  I had like half a sandwich.  At least me and Opie went for lunch.  It was pretty good.  I had half a sandwich, though.  That was it.  Anyway, on with the radio show.  Then we had a go.  What?  I'm talking about lunch.  I know you're talking about lunch.  I was...  What? 
[00:26:00]  Damn.  What?  Oh, boy.  Why is everyone tuning in our show today?  I don't get it.  Hello?  Hello?  Why are you listening?  Nothing to see here.  Go away.  Move on.  Move on.  Move on.  Shut up.  Why is everyone tuning in to the radio show today?  It's kind of weird.  Phone line 212-757-1027. 
[00:26:30]  The fax line is 212-957-9639.  In all seriousness, someone's got to get Aunt and I lunch.  Our lunch plans got disrupted a little bit, and we're really hungry.  We could talk about the fact that we can't talk about the fact that we can't talk about the fact.  Yeah, we could definitely say that's twice removed.  We've got to go inside jokes, please.  We've got to move on with our radio show, Anthony.  Yes, we do.  Moving right along, it would be best to do that, right? 
[00:27:00]  Let's go to John.  John, what's going on?  Good afternoon, boys.  How are you?  How are you doing?  Good.  New York Radio Message Board.  Yeah, we talk about them all the time, yes.  Has you guys allegedly...  Allegedly.  ...being thrown out of some press conference?  Oh, what happened to John?  John!  What happened?  Why did they hang up on John?  I don't know. 
[00:27:30]  Who was that?  Guys, chill out.  You're going to get us screwed, man.  Yeah, please.  No, John.  What happened?  We were all having so much fun.  I'm really hungry, but mellow out guy.  Yes, am I.  You're going to get us so screwed.  I'm starving.  Anyway, let's go to Brandon.  Oh, hey.  Brandon, what's going on?  How are you guys doing?  We're doing great.  How was raw last night?  Raw was absolutely fantastic. 
[00:28:00]  They rocked.  We were sitting ringside, like in the, what, like the fourth row, Anthony?  Yeah.  We were sitting to the left of Jim Ross and the King.  Damn, wow.  And I got to say hi to everyone we met.  Everyone was really, really cool to us.  We took a lot of pictures.  We shook a lot of hands.  Yes.  And we got to thank all the psychopaths for showing up at the garden last night with just  a ton of O&A-related signs.  Mm-hmm.  I was looking for you.  Right before the Mick Foley tribute. 
[00:28:30]  Yeah.  They looked on it.  We were guys looking for you, but we couldn't find you.  We couldn't see you.  Man, half the place knew where we were.  People were screaming from the other side of the garden.  Yeah, they showed one giant sign of 1027, Opie and Anthony.  One?  There was millions of them last night.  Well, there was one huge banner as they panned the crowd I particularly saw.  Oh, you know who that was?  That could have been Spaz.  That was Spaz.  He was getting on TV like crazy.  And also, the guy on the runway, kind of, where all the wrestlers walk out.  We saw you, pal, and you should come on by the station. 
[00:29:00]  We want to completely hook you up with a ton of stuff.  That guy was right on the ramp that the wrestlers walked down, and he had the biggest  wow sign, and it was shoving it right in the Rock's face when the Rock was walking  up the ramp and everything.  Yeah, he was right on the ramp to the right when you're looking at the jumbotron or whatever  they call it there.  Can I ask two quick questions?  Yes.  Did you guys get to go backstage after the roll last night?  Tell you the truth, they invited us, but we didn't want to push our luck.  We had a ton of people from the WWF coming on over and saying hi to us and stuff. 
[00:29:30]  We were quite flattered.  And we have an announcement on our show today.  The feud with the WWF is officially over.  Yes.  It's officially over.  They treated us really, really well and gave us a ton of tickets to give away to their  upcoming events and stuff.  So we made good with those guys.  You guys going to do any bits at WrestleMania for the show?  Well, they're flying us out to L.A. for WrestleMania, and yeah, we're going to come back with all  sorts of stuff.  One last question.  I'll let you guys go.  What happened after they went off the air last night with The Rock? 
[00:30:00]  Did they just end, or?  No, The Rock kicked the crap out of Triple H.  Cool.  Thanks a lot, guys.  All right, man.  Let's go to Mitch.  Mitch, what's going on?  Yeah, Opie and Anthony.  Yes.  I met you guys today at the Howard Press Conference this morning.  Oh, no.  You guys are going to get us screwed, man.  I met you guys today at the Howard Press Conference this morning.  I met you guys at the Howard Press Conference this morning.  Why?  I don't know what you're talking about.  Mitch, you're going to get us screwed.  Yeah. 
[00:30:30]  Oh, man.  This is what I told a bunch of people around here.  This is what was going to happen today.  I know.  Anyway, phone calls.  Let's go on to Peter.  Peter, what's going on?  You're next on N.E.W.  What's up, Peter?  Come on.  You.  He's listening to the radio, or his name isn't Peter.  Dude, it's you, the one that's giggling.  No, it's Steve.  Steve.  Well, we're talking to you, obviously. 
[00:31:00]  I'm not going to curse, bud.  Well, it says Peter on the screen.  What do you got?  No, it was Steve.  Yeah, guys.  I saw you last night on Raw about 1030.  Oh, really?  Yeah, it was right behind the booth, a fourth row midsection.  Yes.  Yeah, there was a couple of big wow posters there.  A couple?  A red one.  I couldn't count all the wow signage that was at the garden last night.  We've got to thank the psychopaths once again.  Yeah, it looked kind of cool.  It was great.  My favorite sign was, I love camel toe.  That was on TV a bunch of times. 
[00:31:30]  It was really, really funny.  Yeah, they were showing a lot of good spots over there, wasn't it?  Right.  Just throwing a prop for you guys.  Good luck.  All right, Steve.  Thank you.  All right, take care.  It was a good Raw last night, too, huh?  Yeah.  We had great seats, man.  Got to thank WWF.  They hooked us up.  Yes.  Jeff from Rockville Center on the instant feedback.  That giant 1027 sign, excuse me, held by Spaz, was given a full view right after they showed  the McFoley match.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was all over the place.  Great.  All right, and we've got to regroup already.  How the hell did that happen? 
[00:32:00]  We're going to have to get another phone screener because we like these jobs.  Whew.  Goddamn.  Dude, it's chill.  You're going to get us really screwed.  That's all I can say right now.  Just chill the F out.  Chill.  All right.  We'll be back with more of your phone calls.  212-757-1027.  Opie and Anthony.  Jeff, we get these illiteracy off the air sleepers.  We suck.  If I wasn't on it, I wouldn't listen.  1-0-2-7-W-N-E-W.  Opie. 
[00:32:30]  Opie.  I have water detention.  Opie's on the rack.  I'm feeling a little bloated today.  Opie, you are such a woman.  Oh, come on.  Opie, we're calling annies you wear.  Call me a fag, whatever.  You wearing a bra?  Yeah.  That's pretty gay, man.  Opie, you are such a woman.  Why am I such a fag?  Why am I such a fag?  Usually I have to go to Christopher Street to see that.  I feel so sexy.  I'm a wimp.  I'm a fudge.  I like my vagina.  Opie, you are such a woman.  I have water detention.  I'm feeling a little bloated today. 
[00:33:00]  I have water detention.  I'm feeling a little bloated today.  You wearing a bra?  Yeah.  That's pretty gay, man.  Yeah, I want to give Al Wilker the rusty tuba.  Whatever you say on this ends up on some wacky promo.  You got me.  1-0-2-7-W-N-E-W.  Lynn Fiskey working on a new CD, Anthony.  Yeah.  Let's see what Fred Durst comes up with next.  Also, one of my favorite bands heading into the studio.  New album out later on this year for Tool. 
[00:33:30]  Tool, that enigma of a band.  Don't know much about Tool, but God damn, do they rock.  Cool.  It's the O&A Show.  2-1-2-7-5-7.  1-0-2-7 is our phone number.  Yeah.  If you're working, you want to send a fax, 2-1-2-9-5-7-9-6-3-9.  Let's go right back to the phones and talk to Tommy.  Tommy, what's going on today, man?  What's up?  What's up?  Dude, I went down to WWF Cafe last night.  Yeah. 
[00:34:00]  Next best thing to be in there.  Cool.  I'm sitting down.  All of a sudden, they rope off a section, one table in front of me.  Waitress says, D-Lo's coming down.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, cool.  So he walks in with Ivory.  D-Lo and Ivory are sitting at a table next to us.  D-Lo's woman, ugliest piece of ass you've ever seen in your life.  Ivory?  No, D-Lo's woman.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  She had three chins, a big ass, and he was with two other blonde-haired chicks.  Very nice.  How hot is Ivory in person? 
[00:34:30]  Very.  Man, unbelievable, right?  I tell you, I was sitting with a girl, with a girl with me, and we're watching, and I  said, look at Ivory.  She's like, hey, she's pretty hot.  Yeah.  I was like, come on, I'll drop a line, we'll go over and talk to him.  Oh, look at you.  They were very cool.  Very cool.  Nice.  Then, ten minutes later, he comes Rakishi and Tukul and Mike Christopher.  Oh, yeah?  They all were there, man.  It was a big party.  I felt like king of the world.  Was this after Raw, or?  No, actually, D-Lo and Ivory were in. 
[00:35:00]  They stayed during the whole Raw.  Yeah.  And then Rakishi and the boys came in after.  Nice.  It was real cool.  Oh, well, very cool.  I'm glad you had a good time.  Yeah, she said, you guys, big ups to you guys, she said.  Yeah, we had a lot of fun with Ivory yesterday.  She enjoyed coming down.  We'll have to have her on again.  She was a lot of fun.  All right.  Peace out, guys.  Thank you, Tommy.  All right, bye.  Let's go to Paul.  Paul, you're next on N.E.W.  What's going on, Paul?  Hey, you know.  Hey.  It's Fez.  It's Fez.  What is up with that show?  What, Ron and Fez? 
[00:35:30]  Yeah, Ron and Fez.  One of our new shows started last night, Anthony?  Yes.  They were talking about how they know Opie.  He gave them a good greeting.  Well, I was a little hammered after Raw.  I came by the station, and I wished them good luck, sure.  Oh, they're terrible.  I was listening to my love line.  They're like, Adam Kroll will be right back.  And then Ron and Fez comes on.  Paul, Paul.  You've got to give people a chance.  You've got to give people a chance.  The first day I heard you in that, right?  Yeah.  You were talking about Patrick Ewing and his big nose, and he's a monkey. 
[00:36:00]  It was great.  I'm trying to take for that.  Yeah, really.  First time I hear Tom, like, okay, Tubby Tom sucks, but at least he's interesting.  Yeah.  These guys are horrible.  No, listen, man.  You can't crucify them yet.  People crucify them at night.  Oh, my God.  Well, they continue to crucify us, but, no, in all fairness, you've got to give all the  new shows at least a minimum of three months before you make your decision.  Believe me, if any of the shows blow, you'll hear it from us first.  Don't worry about it.  Listen.to slash suburban trash. 
[00:36:30]  Come on.  Give them a chance, man.  I was listening on the way home last night, and for their first night, I thought they did  a great, great job.  Dude.  And that's my God's honest opinion, man.  You were hammered.  Well, yeah, but, no, man.  I'm sure anything sounds good when you're hammered.  No, you've got to give them a chance.  No one gave Ant and I a chance at first, so we're not going to be the ones that, like,  you know, trash them after their first day.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, this isn't a suburban trash.  Three months into it, then maybe we'll start trashing, but.  Suburban trash.  Suburban trash.  Like, come on. 
[00:37:00]  Look at them plugging.  Suburban trash.  I know.  We hear you.  We hear you.  Oh, we got you.  Thank you.  All right.  Jesus.  We hope all our faithful listeners give all the brand new shows a chance.  Yes.  You know, we're completely into the Radio Chicks show.  Uh-huh.  We got a brand new show starting at 7 tonight.  Don and Mike starting at 7 o'clock tonight.  Yes.  A much, much, much, much better show than Tom Likas.  It has to be said.  Come on.  A much, much better show. 
[00:37:30]  What?  Compliments our show much, much better, and we are going to support them and give them  a chance to succeed here at N.E.W.  Without a doubt.  Trying to build the station up.  We're going to support Ron and Fez.  We're going to support Don and Mike, and we're going to support the Radio Chicks.  I didn't come in last night to say hi to Don and Fez.  Ron and Fez.  Ron and Fez.  Mike, Ron and Fez.  I don't know.  I can't even get the name straight yet.  Yeah.  You know what it's like for me, though?  Like, I was in the back, and I don't know.  This place has been like the nom or something. 
[00:38:00]  You see people come in.  You don't want to make friends with them.  You turn around.  You just see the back of their skull blow out, and they're gone.  Yeah.  You don't know.  I'm waiting.  I've got to give it a little time.  Well, that's how it is with the salespeople upstairs.  Yeah.  I don't even bother to get to know the new salespeople.  No.  Because the odds are 70% of them are gone.  Yeah.  But Ron and Fez, I was listening, and I kind of wanted a computer in front of me.  Yeah.  You know, they start talking about a lot of online stuff.  I love going online. 
[00:38:30]  They've got a good concept.  I guess their official time is going to be 11 to, I think, 3, is what I'm hearing.  Yeah.  And they've got a good concept.  You know, you hang out with your computer, and you web surf with the guys.  Yeah.  You turn each other on to websites.  And it was interesting for the first night.  It was something definitely different.  Yeah.  You know?  Definitely.  I kind of dug it.  I wish, like I said, I had a computer, because they were talking about that Voyager dorm thing.  I want to check that out.  I mean, anything's better than five hours of Lovelines. 
[00:39:00]  Yeah.  Lovelines is fun to listen to for, like, 15, 20 minutes, but five hours.  Oh, my God.  How much can you talk about crabs?  Right.  You know, what's tripping out of places.  And a very sad day, Tom, like it's officially not part of our radio station anymore.  So, very, very sad day for us here at NAW, if so.  Actually, maybe, I don't know, maybe we could take Tom out Columbine style.  Okay?  In honor of Tom, like it?  Yeah. 
[00:39:30]  Come on.  See ya.  Bye-bye.  All he had to do was give us some respect.  Some recognition.  Show a little respect for the guys that have been through hell at this station.  Hell and back.  Amen.  But he chose not to, so.  Go bye.  Bye-bye, Tommy.  Jimmy, what's going on?  Jimmy.  Jimmy.  Hello?  You're up, dude.  Oh, what's up?  It's Jerry.  Jerry.  Jerry.  Yeah, look.  Wait, hold on.  Get Spaz in here. 
[00:40:00]  Jesus.  He's got to start getting this straight, because he's out of his effing mind.  Spaz, get these names right.  I'm trying.  I don't ever...  I'm trying.  I didn't know what you mean.  It's Jerry, not Jimmy.  I thought I heard...  I had to confuse Steve with, uh, what was Pete?  I thought I heard...  Because these guys will not answer us unless we, like, got their name right.  Well, you've got to figure this is Spaz.  I'll listen better.  Spaz.  One more person gets the name effed up. 
[00:40:30]  Another shot of toilet bowl water.  It seems to be the only thing that really works.  No, let's pick something different.  You really want me to pick something different?  Because I will.  It might not be as tasty as toilet water, believe me.  No, something...  I don't want to...  It might entail something out on the street.  I don't want to drink anything or eat anything.  Hmm?  Well, then, don't screw the names up.  Just get the names right.  Get the names right.  Of course.  It's good, because we look like idiots sitting here going, Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve, 
[00:41:00]  Steve.  My name's Ron.  Right.  You know, you're like, what?  So, what's your name, man?  It's Jerry.  All right.  I listened to Ron and Feds last night, a little bit.  Yeah.  I thought it was pretty good.  You know, I listened for...  I didn't listen that long.  I listened for about 20 minutes, but I think they did a pretty decent job.  Yeah.  We'd really appreciate it if you guys gave all the new shows a chance.  Give them all a chance.  Like we said, if they blow, we'll have fun ripping into them until we boot their ass.  Exactly.  And believe it or not, you know, I don't think Steve and Sue think this is the truth, but  we did give them a very fair chance. 
[00:41:30]  Yeah?  Yeah.  We waited a really long time before we made our opinion on that.  And we're going to do the same with all the new shows that come in.  All right?  So be good.  Please be good.  Because we really want to stay here.  And if we don't get some shows that you guys really like, we're all screwed.  Yeah.  All right?  All right.  Thank you, Jimmy.  Take it easy.  All right.  Jerry.  Jerry.  Jerry.  See, it says...  Sorry.  Bye, Jerry.  Bye.  Bye.  Sorry about that.  All right.  Let's go to John.  John, you're next on N.E.W.  What's going on today? 
[00:42:00]  What's up, One?  How are you guys doing?  Real good.  Good.  Did you see page eight of the Daily News today?  Yeah.  Open up my workbook.  Love match for two athletes, a tennis and a hockey star.  Oh, yeah.  What could it be?  Anna Kornikova's going to be fouled.  I'm not.  You're right.  She already is fouled.  She's a hockey twat.  What is with her?  Did you guys see what the restaurant owner said?  What?  They're going to have beautiful babies.  Beautiful, strong, fast, and perfect.  Good.  Arian.  You know, she was going out with that Sergei for a while. 
[00:42:30]  Yeah.  That was only a little while ago.  Dumped him for another hockey player.  Imagine that out on the ice.  Yeah.  Her box has seen more action than these guys have seen on the ice.  That's another meaning into the crease.  You know, they're on the same team?  Yeah.  On the Panthers.  Oh, my God.  That's just got to be a little much.  They live in the same building in Miami Beach.  Yeah.  B.R.A. in Kornikova.  That's cool.  That's awesome.  Imagine having that as a neighbor.  Well, it's a very, very sad day for mankind in general. 
[00:43:00]  You know?  It's almost as sad as the day we all found out that Pamela Anderson got pregnant.  Like we all had a shot.  Well, it's nice to dream, though, Anthony.  You never know, you know?  You like to think you might have a shot, a slight shot, but...  A shot at Anna.  Yeah, we saw that on the paper today, John.  All right, guys.  See you later, sellouts.  That's us.  Yeah, that's us, all right.  The sellouts.  Let's go to Chris.  Chris, you're next on N.E.W.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  How are you?  I've been listening to you guys for about two years now since I was in high school and 
[00:43:30]  moving to Georgia.  Me and my buddy, we're both moving down to Georgia, and we want to say thank you for  all the years of listening, so we got a nice little psycho army plan.  Oh, what are you going to do down there?  Well, we're going to do it up here.  I've already gotten on TV with WOW before, but that was in another country.  Yeah.  So, can I say it on the air?  Yeah, hit it.  We're going to walk up and down the streets of New York with a gigantic WOW banner.  Oh, when are you going to do that?  Either this Wednesday or next Wednesday.  Do it this Wednesday.  Do it tomorrow.  Do it tomorrow?  Yeah, you can start at the station.  Psycho Mark will go with you.  Okay. 
[00:44:00]  Maybe we'll have like a little WOW parade.  We'll get others to do it.  All right.  All right?  Okay, what time should we be there?  Just show up around, I don't know, 2.30 tomorrow.  2.30 tomorrow at the station?  Yeah, we'll remember you.  Okay, my friend wants to say hi to you.  Go ahead.  Hey, what's up, guys?  What's up, man?  Thanks for all the listening.  I don't even know what to say now.  All right, well, have fun in Georgia, all right?  Yeah, you guys going to get syndicated for us?  We're trying.  Trying?  How about get us going to Wyoming?  No, I don't think that's possible.  All right, thanks a lot, guys.  See you tomorrow.  All right, bro.  Bye. 
[00:44:30]  Can we get the radio chick in here?  We've got to get the radio chick and Butchie in here,  because I think she's responsible for Kathie Lee Gifford saying she's quitting in July.  I was jumping up and down this morning.  Yeah.  I watched the Regis and Kathie Lee show every day,  hoping she's going to announce she's leaving that show.  And you can just tell by looking at Regis that it was the happiest day of his life this morning.  Because he doesn't need her anymore.  He's got the ABC show. 
[00:45:00]  There's rumors he's going to make something like $20 million.  $20 million!  I don't need the whore!  And he was acting like he was really going to miss her.  No way.  They're going to get some young, hot thing in there that's going to kiss Regis' ass.  You know what?  That doesn't tell all the stupid stories and all that crap.  Bye-bye, Kathie Lee.  What is she going to do?  That's it.  She's going to fade into obscurity.  Yeah.  She's going to be some little answer on the You Don't Know Jack computer game. 
[00:45:30]  She's convinced that she's going to be a Broadway star now, Anthony.  Yeah.  She had a little taste of Broadway, and she really thinks that she's going to have to be a star on Broadway.  I think she's going to whore her kids out to the porno industry.  That'd be something.  What's up, Ben?  They're on the way down.  Cody and Cassidy.  All right.  Yeah.  Getting banged.  Let's go to Scott.  Scott, what's going on, man?  Scott!  Hello?  What's up?  You're on the radio.  This is Steve.  Jesus Christ.  All right, man. 
[00:46:00]  Okay.  All right.  How do we know you didn't just say Steve?  Huh?  Spaz.  Well, what do you got for the show, dude?  We're not going to play this stupid game with Spaz today.  I wanted to talk about Kathy Lee.  All right, go ahead.  Well, did you hear her today on the phone?  She was quitting?  On the phone.  On the show?  She said she was done in July?  Yeah, we did hear that.  I think that if you're going to have the parade tomorrow, I want to join the parade and have a banner with Wow and supporting her quitting.  All right, thanks, man. 
[00:46:30]  That obviously was somebody who was just trying to get Spaz in trouble, I think.  Well, we've got to welcome the radio chick and Butchie on to our radio show today.  Look at this.  We're still bowing to them, Anthony?  Yeah, this is like when the Jetsons were on the Flintstones.  It's kind of cool.  It's pretty funny, man.  Sort of weird.  Well, we're kind of cool.  Obviously, Butchie did the fine.  Well, you want to tell a story?  Because I'm here and we're getting all the details wrong. 
[00:47:00]  The famous letterman stuff.  Yeah, she screamed at me after I was on with the guys Friday because I told it too fast or I didn't tell it right.  Yeah, who had the gun?  Someone had the gun and then the hand grenades.  It was a kind of assault with a deadly bra, more or less.  But, well, you heard the details the other day.  We actually were talking about Kathie Lee the day before on our show and a listener called in and said we could have her tickets if we would do something meaningful with them.  So we went and we got in line and we tried to get a whole bunch of people online to help us.  Maybe we could recruit some to help getting people to chant, Cody, Cody, or put on a bra or something. 
[00:47:30]  But you know what's in the audience for Letterman with Kathie Lee hosts?  Big, fat-ass podcaster winner in Midwestern housewives.  And the other people were a bunch of gay guys there to see Linda Etter.  So anyone we tried to recruit, they were like, screw you.  We're really here to see her.  So then we became terrorists.  You know, we're on our own.  And Butch had been fortified with what, Butch?  A couple of beers and some Jose Cuervo.  That'll do it. 
[00:48:00]  Yeah, I knew I knew it.  Courage in a bottle.  Yeah, I couldn't do it alone.  Did you get them juiced up at a bar nearby?  Right next door.  Really?  Yeah.  That's really smart.  Yeah, you need that.  I've seen Butchie under the influence.  He's a lot different.  Yeah, a lot different.  That's right.  Well, there's a lot more courage when you have liquid nuts.  We all know that.  We all know that.  And so they have tight security there.  I mean, they know exactly who you are, what ticket number you have, what seat you're in.  They know every single person in that studio audience every night.  And it's like getting marched into a concentration camp when you get it. 
[00:48:30]  There's so much supervision there.  So the Letterman show is like a concentration camp.  Like Auschwitz.  Wow.  I've been there a few times.  She's 100% right.  You can't move.  You've got to stay single file.  And they watch everyone sit.  And it's a pain in the neck.  So we got seated in the middle of the aisle.  Then Butch said to me, we've got to do the bra thing.  Well, somebody called earlier during the show and said, you ought to throw a bra at her because everybody says she's not wearing one anymore.  She's trying to get attention.  So one of the listeners called during the day when we were talking about this before we even knew we had the tickets and said, you ought to throw a bra at her. 
[00:49:00]  So then when the booze kicked in and we're sitting in the theater, I said, yeah, you've got to have, there's nothing else we can do.  I'm going to have to throw a bra at her.  So give me your bra.  I checked mine out to make sure it was one I wanted to show.  Imagine if it was one of your old bras or something.  One of those creepy, you know, bad bras.  One that's just rare around the house.  Right.  One from like 1980.  Right.  So it was an okay bra and I had to take it off flash dance style and some old guy from Wisconsin was sitting right next to me wondering what I was doing. 
[00:49:30]  So then I'm braless and Butchie has my warm bra in his hand.  Yeah.  But we were in the middle of the aisle.  That's rough.  So we had to keep trading with people two by two to move over.  And people were wondering why we wanted to sit on the end.  So all of a sudden we're friendly New Yorkers.  We're like, hey, would you like a better view?  Come on here to the center.  Sure.  And then the next one, the next one pair of people, I said, you know, I always like to view things from the right. 
[00:50:00]  Do you mind if we switch?  And they're buying it.  I mean, I know.  Oh, yeah.  I understand.  No problem.  View from the right.  Sure.  Sure.  And then the last one, Butch turned to him and said, my wife is sick.  We might have to leave in a hurry.  Could we have the aisle seat?  Perfect.  Yeah.  Except she didn't sit in the aisle seat.  I did.  I'm not the one who's sick.  So then now I'm three rows from the stage.  Yes, you are.  Three rows from the stage on what?  Near the door?  The left side.  Yeah, right where the band is.  Gotcha.  And there's security lined up all on the edge and all along the front of the stage. 
[00:50:30]  Well, the security on the edge is those pages, those college kids in sweaters.  Yeah, what are they going to do?  Right.  And one of them was a girl.  And I looked at them and I said, I'll blow right by them.  You could take the girl out.  Yeah.  Yeah, just hit her with an elbow.  Well, punch, she'll go right down.  So I knew they'd be no problem.  But the security guard, there were two.  And one was a big black guy, you know, standing right at the edge of the stage, right next to the camera.  And I knew if I was going to get up there, I'd have to get around him. 
[00:51:00]  And somehow I managed to do that.  Yeah, and I was scared not only because I was scared for him, but I was cold.  And my nipples were laid for me.  You know, to keep that theater cold.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's a problem.  How much do you want to bet Anthony's going to have another dirty dream about me?  Oh, no, come on.  I'm looking at him looking at you.  Rick, turn down the heat.  Yeah, look at Rick's up at the thermostat.  Rick's turned down the heat.  We'll stall, Rick.  We'll get another ten minutes out of him.  Lock the door?  Yeah, lock the door.  So Butch rushed the stage through the bra, yelled, put on a bra. 
[00:51:30]  Yeah, radio chick rules, and it was like the raid on Aunt Kebby.  Oh, no.  He was Hinkley, and she was Reagan, and the Secret Service was taking him down.  What was going on in your mind at that point?  I was really, I was thinking, oh, my God, what did I get this boy into?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Turn down.  And they took him, and he makes light of this, but it looked nasty from my perspective.  They grabbed him.  A couple of burly guys grabbed him, pushed his face up against the wall. 
[00:52:00]  Oh, my God.  In front of the whole audience?  Yeah.  Well, no, they grabbed me and pulled me back, and those doors are right there.  You know, up you've been there.  I know where the doors are.  And they go right out to the street.  The door letterman always goes out on the side there.  Exactly, when he goes out to do those man-on-the-street stuff.  And when they pulled me back, my face was to the crowd, and everybody was looking at me.  And I told you this on Friday, they were horrified.  Like, what did you just do?  What did he do?  Oh, my God.  So I knew I had to do something.  I yelled, radio chick rules.  And then they pulled me out the door and shoved me right against the wall outside. 
[00:52:30]  Not in the theater, but out in the street.  Yeah.  Where they could work you over.  Yeah.  Without an audio.  They really didn't, though, because I didn't resist.  At this point, the hard part was over.  And I'd been in trouble enough times to know, don't fight back now.  What are you going to do?  Yeah.  So I just put my arms down by my sides.  Yes, sir.  No, sir.  That kind of thing.  And eventually they realized I wasn't going to cause them more trouble.  They just let you walk?  Well, no.  They bawled me out for a while.  Well, they called the cops.  Yeah.  They called the cops.  Yeah.  New York City's finest had to come down, which really made me feel bad, because I don't like 
[00:53:00]  to piss the cops off.  Sure.  Especially in this city, you know.  Yeah.  I'll shoot you.  But he disappeared for a while.  The security sat next to me, and I had to hide my recorder and my nipples.  And what are you just like?  Did they ask you?  Did you know who that was?  Well, about two more bars into her song, she had then paused and picked up my bra and put  it on.  And she didn't fill it out.  No, I noticed that.  And then I'm thinking, wow, what did I do to him?  He needs bail money.  I've got to get out of here and help him.  But I was trapped in by security, so I tapped the security guy on the shoulder, and I said, 
[00:53:30]  you know that guy, that ball guy you just took out of here?  He's my companion.  Companion.  That's good.  Not too much commitment there.  If they want to drag you in, it would be anything.  Did you know he was going to do this?  How did you get in here?  Where did you get the tickets?  You know, look, I've got to leave, I said.  They wouldn't let me leave, but finally I prevailed.  And then I started running the streets looking for him, and it's hard to run when you don't  have a bra.  And I couldn't find him.  That's why you've got black guys. 
[00:54:00]  I couldn't find him because they had taken him away, and I didn't know whether to go  to Midtown South or wait on the corner.  Yeah, they just took me to the lobby, though.  They took me from outside.  They didn't want to make a scene outside on the street.  So they dragged me in the lobby and started lecturing me, you know, what do you think you're  doing?  There was kids in the audience.  It was a bra.  I think they've seen a bra before.  They told me it was trespassing.  It was an automatic fine.  How was that trespassing?  I guess if you go on the stage, it's considered private property or something. 
[00:54:30]  You weren't even on the stage, though, right?  Yeah, I was on the stage.  I got as far as there's a partition that surrounds the band.  So I got up on the stage.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, and I got like this right in front of the partition.  I couldn't go any further, so I just threw the bra, and it actually worked out well,  because if you've seen the video, it drops right at the beat.  Well, it was perfect.  Well, after our road show, we were watching Kathie Lee with half an eye with the sound down,  and all of a sudden we're like, wow, someone threw a bra on stage.  Because we didn't hear you that day.  I had no clue you guys were doing it.  Right.  I thought it was hilarious. 
[00:55:00]  We got lucky.  And just like everyone that probably called the show, everyone thought it was a setup,  like the Letterman people set this little bit up.  Yeah.  But here's the kicker to the whole thing.  Here's the best part.  Before we go on the air this morning, Kathie Lee makes her announcement that she's not going  to continue with Regis and Kathie Lee.  Wait a minute.  I still get all choked up?  Okay.  And we get a call from someone we know works inside that show who said,  I don't want you to get too full of yourself, but the bra was a factor. 
[00:55:30]  It was a pair of the edge.  Oh, that bra.  You're my best friend now.  Yep.  Apparently she's afraid for her safety, you know, so nuts like I can get at her, you know,  and for her kids, which, you know, she should be more afraid of what she does to the kids  than somebody like me.  She saw Butch coming at her and freaked, and then afterwards thought, why am I on the show  where I talk about my personal life and I owe myself up to be humiliated by mental cases  like Butch? 
[00:56:00]  And she was teetering anyway, but I swear to God, I'm told that the bra was a factor.  That's like slaying a dragon or something, you know?  Well, you did it.  You're everyone's hero.  Yeah.  In this entire town.  How great is that?  I feel like we performed a public service.  Definitely.  Putting an end to, like, cancer or something, you know?  Well, you guys are like Jonas Salk with polio.  Jesus.  We got a call yesterday for someone that said the picture's in Time Magazine.  Yeah.  The bra?  Yeah, but there's no mention of us. 
[00:56:30]  Well, that's still cool.  Oh, no, it's great.  The picture is everywhere, man.  Oh, go figure.  They don't give credit to radio people for a gag or something.  Yeah.  We had a hard time.  I think maybe we'll get something out of it.  Now, actually, it's a good thing that she quit today.  The timing couldn't have been better.  It gives us, as you know, more mileage out of the story.  Yeah.  It lets us tell more people about it.  Especially now that we're credited.  It's about time.  I feel proud.  Yeah.  It sucks when you pull off something like that and don't get credited.  God.  Yeah.  It used to piss us off all the time.  Yeah.  Remember that when we shot the president? 
[00:57:00]  He's some other guy.  But we can't thank you guys enough for helping us out, putting it on the website and talking  about it.  And, you know, we've heard from tons of O&A listeners.  That's a great story.  Radio checklist.  You know what I'm going to do for you guys, too?  Hold on.  Because these guys hate this sweeper.  Oh, yeah.  Let me play one last time.  We were playing this for a while.  Static.  Bobby and Anthony, two to seven.  Then, more static. 
[00:57:30]  Oh, that's right.  You are winning.  See, we were just meant, you know, the morning thing.  Radio check.  I'm going to hand this sweeper to you.  Handing over the cart?  That's it.  Thank you.  Now you can smash it.  We're all a team.  Smash it.  You can smash it in front of me.  Give me a piece of my own medicine.  I can't do it.  Those carts are pretty heavy-dirty.  Stomp on it.  Come on.  It'd be like a snuff film.  They believe it's your ex or something, man.  Break it.  There you go.  Oh, that's right.  There you go.  Thank you.  There you go. 
[00:58:00]  This is like tycoon.  I don't want to hurt anybody.  I'll show you what.  Here, give me that thing.  It's amazing.  You could bang those carts, stomp on them, and nothing happens.  But if the heads aren't clean, birds, you're a birdie.  There it is.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  No, this thing will not break.  Get a hammer.  Do you want a hammer?  Well, here.  You go.  You're asking Psycho Mark to get a hammer.  That's not a good idea.  Oh, my God.  What does he have?  It's not going to cheat.  Protect your eyes. 
[00:58:30]  It's a knife.  Oh, my God.  He's stabbing it.  This thing will not break.  That's amazing.  Bionic cart.  Go ahead.  The thing will not break.  Oh, there we go.  Wow.  Who has a headache now?  Yeah, I know.  That's what I needed.  Well, guys, thank you so much, man.  Thank you.  Bravo.  Just following your lead.  We bowed you.  I can't believe you killed Kathy Lee.  Hey, you know what?  That's great.  We're just the grasshopper. 
[00:59:00]  You are the one who learned from you.  No, it sucks.  You're going to make us try to do something to top that now.  Please do, because I think I'm unofficially retired.  No, man.  You got a taste of it.  Now you've got to keep going.  I know.  It's a little like a drug.  Especially now that people are doing this.  There's someone on the line that has tickets for Regis on Friday.  For the millionaire show?  You're going to have to go incognito, though.  You're going to have to grow hair.  You know we can't do anything like that.  Yeah, we're really not allowed anywhere. 
[00:59:30]  If you cut out today, you'd get thrown out.  All right, guys.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  The radio chick on before us.  Check out her show.  She's very, very good.  Thanks, guys.

Hey, Paul from Rockland on the instant feedback. 
[01:01:00]  Actually, it's Sky from Brooklyn.  Sorry, Sky from Brooklyn writes,  If you want to outdo the radio chick, you're going to have to have Rosie have sex with a guy.  Ah, yeah, that'll happen.  Not.  Let's go back to the phones if you got something.  212-757-1027.  Let's say hi to Max.  Max, you're next on the radio show.  What's going on, man?  Hey, O&A.  You guys suck today, really. 
[01:01:30]  Thanks, man.  I got a couple of good news for you.  A couple of things.  Number one, Kathy Lee.  She has nothing to worry about.  You know why?  Why?  She has that sweatshop business to fall back on.  Okay.  Yeah, she has no problem at all.  Come time when she leaves that show, she'll fall back on that sweatshop business.  All that cheap labor, no problem.  She'll be making millions.  And the other thing is, I have a capital elite who was on the thing last night.  Was he trying to do, like, a monologue or something? 
[01:02:00]  I think he was.  It seemed like he had jokes written out.  Don't you hate when Christopher Reeve falls on you?  You don't want Christopher Reeve falling on you ever, ever, ever, ever, ever.  God.  Oh.  He hears delivery?  He was reading jokes, Andrew.  I got to tell you.  How about that Pamela Lee?  I hear Pamela Lee and Tommy Lee are breaking up again.  Really?  Yeah.  The latest National Enquirer has them separated again. 
[01:02:30]  Really?  Yeah.  Has he been pounding on her or something?  Well, they got a picture of Tommy Lee in Australia.  Yeah.  On a cell phone, supposedly talking to Pamela back in the States.  Yeah.  And there's, like, this girl next to him, completely complements.  And it looks like a recent picture.  Rock.  He can't drink or party in the States, so he's going elsewhere.  Yeah.  He goes to other places or else he gets arrested, right?  Yeah.  And then they had Pamela having a picnic with her two kids with an unidentified guy.  Uh-oh. 
[01:03:00]  On the latest.  I think it was the Enquirer.  The rag magazines are the best.  Yeah.  They get the story right before anyone else.  Yeah, no matter what they say, people that get all pissed off at the Enquirer and stuff,  I don't know.  That stuff comes true.  Yeah.  Let's go to TJ.  TJ, what's going on today?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I happened to check out Alan Smith's show on the Internet from the New York Radio Message  Boy last night.  Yeah, I guess now he has a little radio show where he discusses radio.  Yeah, it's got to be the worst thing I've ever heard.  I actually made two out of the four pranks that were made last night. 
[01:03:30]  Oh, people were pranking them?  Actually, there weren't that many.  Yeah.  I was actually, there was maybe four.  I was listening from about 8.30 to about 10.  Yeah.  And there weren't a lot.  I got two on, though.  And one was a fake name and one was my real name.  And, you know, I have audio with him if you guys want to hear him.  I don't know.  Yeah, let's check it out.  Well, you want me to stop at any point?  Just let me know, all right?  Well, I mean, do you got to queue it up to the prank part?  Yeah.  One bit's 42 seconds.  The other one's like a minute and 30 seconds.  Look at this.  I got a 42-second radio.  I have it on the computer, so. 
[01:04:00]  Okay, let's hear it, TJ.  Here you go.  This is the first one.  We have a loser on the line.  Do we have TJ on the line?  Good evening.  Hey, Alan.  Hello, TJ.  How you doing?  I'm okay.  How are you?  Pretty good.  Well, how do you feel now that you've been had by Opie and Anthony?  Oh, that's okay.  I don't mind being had by him.  I've been had by a lot more than Opie and Anthony, believe me.  But until Opie or Anthony call me, I don't really think I've been had by them.  No?  No.  Is there any truth to the fact?  Oh, come on, come on, TJ.  You can come up with something quick here now.  Come on, TJ.  The pressure's on. 
[01:04:30]  You've got to try and say something.  I don't know if I've been had by Opie and Anthony.  You've been practicing this all afternoon.  So here's your chance to try and get Alan Smith and say, let's go.  Give me your one-liner.  Come on.  Let's get on me.  Come on.  Come on, TJ.  Come on.  You can do it.  You can do it.  What was that TJ thing?  You got the end to the conversation.  Hello.  The Tuesday night what?  Hummer Club.  The Tuesday night Hummer Club.  That's me, Tuesday night?  It is a very large group.  The problem, TJ, is it's a very large group.  A very large group.  And so to be a member of the Hummer Club that involves me involves women who have to really, 
[01:05:00]  really vocalize very clearly because you need that kind of surface area.  You following me, TJ?  You with me on this, TJ?  Oh.  Okay, TJ, you've been practicing all afternoon.  I know you really wanted to get at me here, so you've got to make a prediction now.  We had a drum roll sound effect.  I'd like to hear it now, please.  Alan, Alan.  Alan, stick to root canals, pal.  Alan and Anthony fans are some of my favorite people to talk to. 
[01:05:30]  So that would be great.  How's it going?  Thank you.  Alan Snippen doing his Tom Likus.  Guys, was that Tom Likus or what?  Wow, he's really taking that Tom Likus persona.  Yeah, I heard you say something about the dentist.  That was my second thing.  I called back under John from Manhattan or something.  Yeah.  And I have that one if you want to hear it.  No, we've heard enough.  Okay.  And, Alan, trust me, we will not be calling your cute little radio show the 10 people listen to.  Yeah.  Ever, ever, ever, you will not hear us on your little radio show. 
[01:06:00]  And, guys, about half the teachers I have in my high school listen to you guys, like, religiously.  Oh, cool.  And my math teacher came up to me, and he told me that he heard me on the show a few times.  So in effort to help my low grade, I just want to say hello to Mr. Lynch.  Very good.  Talk to you guys later.  You guys rock.  All right, a smart guy there.  Yeah.  Well, thank you.  Thanks, guys.  All right, bye.  Let's go to Pete.  Pete, you're next on N.E.W.  What's going on?  Oh, I'm laughing sick after what I just heard.  Why?  Oh, that whole thing with the Allen thing.  Oh.  Yeah.  Anyway, Pam and Tommy, they're in the paper tape. 
[01:06:30]  They're being sued by the ex-masseuse.  I read that, too.  The dog bit the masseuse on the ass or something.  Yes, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, real quick.  How gay was that thing at the wrestling with them dancing in the ring?  Well, with Rakeshi.  The China and the Rakeem.  Rakeshi and Y2J.  It was fun.  I had a great time at Raw last night, I've got to say.  Yeah, real quick.  Come on.  We're dying to know. 
[01:07:00]  Pete, you suck.  You're going to get us screwed.  Yeah.  Come on.  You guys got some clout.  You guys think I'm going to get that much trouble?  No, they're talking about it as we speak, so.  We have clout, but someone else has more clout than we do.  That's the problem.  Screw the Jew.  No, that's a problem.  Take care, pal.  Some people could dig that, but they can't take it.  That's all I can say.  Don't worry about the Jew.  He ain't nothing.  All right, Pete.  Thank you.  Take care.  All right.  Why does it always have to turn ethnic or racial?  My God.  We would talk about it if we truly believed that our jobs weren't in jeopardy. 
[01:07:30]  Trust me.  Yeah.  I kind of want to stick this out a little longer, at least.  No little longer would be nice.  Oh, boy.  Well, look at that.  We've got to take another break now and get another phone screener.  We've been through two today already.  My God.  We gave the bosses our word that we wouldn't be talking about what happened today.  Yeah.  All right.  We'll be back.  Stay there.  This is this.  O.B. and Anthony.  I.  I.  I.  This is debauchery mania. 
[01:08:00]  I.  I.  I.  Prostate exams for everyone.  I.  I.  I.  I.  I.  I.  I.  I.  I.  I.  I.  And.  And.  And.  Oh.  Those guys are fast.  W.  And.  Hey, it's the O.B. and Anthony Show.  212-757-1027.  What's up?  Back to the line, 212-957-9639.  Let's see if, uh, the new screener's gonna do a good job here.  Anthony, what's going on? 
[01:08:30]  On the phone line there, Anthony, what's up?  Yeah, that guy, Allen sed carre  in the morning? Yeah. We're not going to  morning. Sorry.  Yeah, I got something for you. What?  Jeffrey, what the hell is wrong with you?  Why? Are these  fucking insane? Wait a minute, watch your mouth.  What are you talking about? Huh?  Just bland? What do you mean, what am I  talking about? Yeah, we got to test the new  owners, man. We got to test the new  owners. That's very nice. Well, there's an old  bit. There's a voice saying it doesn't want to hear. 
[01:09:00]  Well, where'd he  get that from? That was from  Boston. Yeah, when we gave away the  hundred grand and then... Somebody called  old mad at me for going along  with the bit that you came up with, Opie.  Because they didn't want you to get fired. Yeah.  Okay, that's cute.  That's good.  Alright, let's go to Tom. Tom, what's up?  Hey, guys. This show is a mess  today. What's up, Tom? It really is.  You guys got to talk about  what it is that you can't talk about.  Freaking people. I told the 
[01:09:30]  bosses this would happen to them. Yeah.  I hope they understand  that we're just trying to do our  radio show. Yeah.  Go to Chunk.  Chunk! Yo,  ONA, my two new favorite whores.  What's up, man? What's going on? Is this not  frigging America where you guys can't talk about  this? Yeah, but within  America,  there are things such  as, I don't know, institutions  or corporations that you are in  that are not a democracy. Yeah, I understand that. 
[01:10:00]  But it's better to hear it from the horse's mouth than to read  some fabricated stories. From the horse's mouth?  It's really no big  deal, to be honest with you.  Yeah.  The bosses... Rick, go ask  Jeremy, our new boss, if it's okay to talk.  Will do. Hey, real quick, I appear  every weekend at Exit 17  on the Turnpike, every Saturday and Sunday,  and this Friday, I'll be with the Diceman at  Chavity Hall in Bayonne, and  with the Knights of Columbus. Thank you, Chunk.  Peace! Peace!  All right, Anthony, Celine Dion  suing the National Enquirer. 
[01:10:30]  For what?  Remember, we reported,  I don't know, it had to be about a month and a half ago,  that Celine Dion was  pregnant with twins, Anthony?  Yeah.  Well, she's suing the National Enquirer  for $20 million,  alleging it said  she was pregnant with twins  while knowing the story was false.  Really?  Yes.  Pregnant with twins?  And she's...  Oh, she's not.  She's not pregnant.  National Enquirer said  she was pregnant with twins.  The story was false. 
[01:11:00]  Celine feels like,  well, you know what?  I deserve $20 million for that.  Oh, man.  Like, she needs it.  $20 million.  Well, they've been having a problem,  her and her husband.  What's that husband's name?  Uh, Renee.  Renee.  Renee.  Been having trouble  getting me pregnant.  Well, we could play, uh,  we could play it  from the O&A archives.  Yeah.  I remember that one.  When we announced  that, uh,  Celine was pregnant with twins.  Uh-oh.  I hope we don't get sued. 
[01:11:30]  Well, we were just reading  about, uh,  what we read in the paper.  Yeah.  So, I think we're safe.  I hope so.  But, uh,  I guess this story  is now false.  Celine Dion,  uh,  suing the National Enquirer  for $20 million.  All right.  And that is a no  from our new boss.  Okay.  Okay.  We've got to regroup.  Uh,  God damn it.  What, Ray?  Exact words?  Stay the course.  Okay, we're trying.  Stay the course.  Stay the course.  Let me, Fred.  All right. 
[01:12:00]  From the O&A archives.  Yeah.  When we found out  that Celine was pregnant  with twins,  even though it's not true  as we're finding out today.  Yeah.  Anthony,  did you read about  Celine Dion in the paper today?  Uh, yeah.  Everyone waiting  for our comments  on Celine Dion.  It's being reported  in the papers today  that, uh,  she is pregnant  with twins, Anthony.  Woo!  Now, one paper's saying  that, uh,  she's pregnant with twins.  The other's saying  it's, uh,  it's false.  It's not true.  I would like to think  that, uh,  it is true  and that Celine Dion  is pregnant with twins, 
[01:12:30]  and twins.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  What,  did they freeze  her husband's sperm  or something?  Did you see that?  He has cancer,  so they, uh,  froze his sperm  and she was impregnated  with her husband's, uh,  frozen sperm.  Yeah.  I guess because, uh,  what kind of cancer  does he have  that he can't, uh,  just give her  the high hard one  and do it that way?  Well, they,  they wanted to,  you know,  make sure they were  gonna have kids.  Right,  with no good.  Wow, 
[01:13:00]  that's something.  His sperm live on.  I am pregnant.  Finally,  we have been trying  for so long  to get pregnant,  and finally,  my husband's sperm  slammed into my egg.  Much like the mighty  Titanic  slammed that iceberg,  splitting it open  and fertilizing an egg  to make another  Celine,  hopefully.  hopefully my legacy  will live on,  as will my camel doll. 
[01:13:30]  It is such a happy moment  for my 58-year-old husband,  Rene,  when he found out  I was pregnant  with twins.  You know,  twin hippos  could fit side by side  in my camel doll.  But these are just  twin babies.  all of the sperm  that was swimming around  in the icy waters 
[01:14:00]  of my uterus.  You know,  most of them die.  Yeah.  Most of the sperm  never make it.  Correct.  They die there  in the icy waters  of my uterus.  But two,  two sperms  lived on,  swam,  swimming,  using all of their might  to find the egg.  The egg to cling to.  These sperms  are the one  that fertilized the eggs.  While the others died,  these sperms  were true  survivors. 
[01:14:30]  You know,  my twin children  can grow to adulthood  and still fit  out of my camel toe.  That huge crevasse  between my legs.  You should see.  Do you know the reason 
[01:15:00]  it had to be  artificial insemination?  I know, why?  They say because  Rene has cancer.  And they froze his sperm  and put it in.  But the truth  of the matter is  he could not even  feel the sides  of my mighty camel toe.  I am so huge.  He kind of slammed it  against the side  a couple of times,  but it did not work.  Now this frozen sperm,  so they made  a sperm popsicle. 
[01:15:30]  Now this frozen sperm,  was it as blue as,  uh,  Yes.  As blue as,  uh, DiCaprio  at the end of Titanic?  Yes.  That's what they  look like,  the sperm frozen  like Leo  at the end of Titanic.  My sperm  will go on. 
[01:16:00]  It was like having  an ice pop in there.  the frozen sperm  of my husband,  Rene.  But I can have  twins now.  And I will dress them  in little jump  suits to show off  their tiny little  camel toes.  Just like mommy.  My camel toe  will live on.  My camel toe  will go on. 
[01:16:30]  All right.  All right.  It's a happy day  for Celine and Rene.  Yes.  Congratulations,  Celine.  Twins.  Pregnant with twins.  Boy,  that's got to be  something for the  OBGYN  checking her out.  All right,  Celine,  hop up on the table.  All righty,  why don't we,  uh,  take a look  of,  oh my.  Look at the size of that. 
[01:17:00]  Let's just,  oh,  hello.  Echo.  Celine,  wow,  you got a lot of room  in here.  Yeah,  let me,  you know,  I don't even need,  uh,  instruments.  I'm just going to  crawl right in,  take a look around  firsthand.  We don't need  a sonogram or anything.  Wow,  here,  deep inside  Celine's womb.  Look at the size  of this place.  Is anyone in here?  In here,  in here,  in here. 
[01:17:30]  Monocchio!  Monocchio!  It's freezing in here.  It's like a  Venus fly snatch.  You gotta watch out.  Scoop me right up.  Where the hell's  the light switch in here?  It's pitch black.  Oh my God. 
[01:18:00]  God damn.  What's that,  trout?  It's gonna climb  way up here.  Yeah,  I could open up  a water park in here.  People could just  slide right back down.  Wherever you are.  Something,  the snatch flu. 
[01:18:30]  Wow.  Oh my God.  What is that?  Oh my God.  It's a T-Rex.  What the hell's  that doing in here?  I just walked  over here.  Oh my God.  This is disgusting.  Who the hell's  that sitting there?  Buddy Edson?  What are you doing  in Celine's womb? 
[01:19:00]  Oh my God,  look,  it's that little  kitner boy from Jaws.  Wasn't a shark  after all.  You're swimming,  you got sucked up  by Celine's shoes.  Hey.  Here's another  walk over here.  Can we see your stuff?  Oh,  hey,  how you doing?  All right,  we're just gonna go  for a little pap smear  here.  It might feel  a little pressure.  Here we go. 
[01:19:30]  I've got enough of that.  Wherever  you are,  I say  All right,  I've got to get out of here.  Oh my God.  This place is huge.  Oh my God,  what?  What's that?  It's coming right for us.  I don't even know 
[01:20:00]  what it was.  Better safe than sorry.  Oh,  very good.  I've got to do  a little bombing.  I see a light.  Oh my God,  it's a tractor trailer  in Celine's womb.  Oh,  there it is.  There's a little baby. 
[01:20:30]  Look at the  camel truck.  Can you walk  out of her womb  and step out  of her pants,  please?  I'm gonna get out of here.  All right,  just coming up  to the exit here.  What's that  right around the corner?  Oh,  absolutely.  Jesus.  I feel much better.  Hey,  it's coming after me. 
[01:21:00]  Is that an Apache  attack helicopter?  All right,  well,  there you have it.  Celine having  twins.  Congratulations.  CBS.  Congratulations  to Celine  and her  husband there.  Maybe that's  where the CBS FM  broadcast from,  Celine's womb.  Elizabeth.  Yeah,  why don't you guys 
[01:21:30]  diss someone  who deserves  to be dissed?  What is your problem,  man?  How old are you,  Elizabeth?  That's irrelevant.  We're in the middle  of a commercial break.  What's your problem?  I think,  why don't you guys  make fun of someone  who deserves  to make fun of?  Like Backstreet Boys?  Elizabeth,  how old are you?  No,  why don't you  make fun of...  Are you pissed off  because you just  made fun of Celine Dion?  Yes,  I am.  I am a huge fan  of your show  and I've been listening  for a long time.  Blah, blah, blah.  Why are you  defending Celine Dion? 
[01:22:00]  No, no, no.  You guys are so cruel  and why don't you  guys pick on someone...  Do you know  anything about her?  She at least  has been honest  about who she is  and where she comes from.  Not like other people.  Honest?  Yeah.  That husband of hers  had an eye on her  when she was like 13.  Right.  Don't you find  that disgusting?  Yes,  I do,  but the record executives  made them  be quiet about it  and I do think  it's disgusting,  but I don't think  he was diddling her 
[01:22:30]  when she was 13.  How do you know?  I don't know.  All I think  is that  she wasn't  putting lines  up her nose.  I think that  whole story  is disgusting.  Relationship's  a little questionable.  Yeah,  he was in his  mid-30s.  She was like 13  when he first met.  And like everyone  has a question  about your relationship.  Come on,  guys,  why do you make  fun of someone  who's weak?  Elizabeth,  shut up.  We're in no mood  to listen to you  today.  We're in no mood.  You're obviously  not a fan  of our show. 
[01:23:00]  I'm a huge fan  of your show,  but you guys  really...  We crossed the line  by making fun  of Celine Dion?  Yeah,  no,  you just,  you know what,  the whole WWF thing  that you guys  pussied out  and gave in  and went to the show  pissed me off.  I've got to ask  you how old  you are.  Come on,  tell us.  Yeah,  tell us.  Why do you care?  Because I'd like  to know if you're  a very stupid adult  or a very intelligent  kid.  Why am I stupid?  Tell me why I'm stupid.  Because I don't  understand why  you're sticking up  for Celine Dion  of all people.  I'm sticking up  for people, 
[01:23:30]  you know,  at least,  you know who I  really want you  guys to make fun of?  Oh,  Linda.  Yes.  Talk to Elizabeth.  Oh,  just shut up.  It's a radio show.  Get a grip.  I am so cool  and chill.  That's not the point.  These guys just,  you're like 13,  right?  No,  I'm nine and a half,  actually.  Why do you let  the children on the show?  She's about,  she's about 19.  Really?  Yeah.  Elizabeth,  how old are you? 
[01:24:00]  19,  right?  You can just  keep guessing.  Linda,  what do you have  for Elizabeth?  It's just,  she's got to get a grip.  She's a public figure.  If you guys want  to make fun of her,  Celine can deal.  Yeah,  please.  I'm sorry,  she annoys the hell  out of me too.  I'm not saying  she annoys me  or doesn't annoy me.  I'm saying  that these guys...  Boy,  Celine,  can you punch your chest  one more time for me?  Go off on,  why don't you go  uncover Rosie's past  and give you stuff on Rosie.  Thank you,  Elizabeth.  We've messed with Rosie.  We've messed with everybody.  I know.  Okay, 
[01:24:30]  you know who you should  mess with?  Mariah Carey.  Mess with Mariah.  Oh,  no,  stop.  We've messed with Mariah Carey  and,  you know,  she's sloppy.  She's a sloppy,  she's a sloppy trash girl.  We've talked about,  sure.  She's from my high school  and we've talked about it.  What else?  No,  I want you to do  a whole bit on her then.  If you're going to,  you know,  give their play.  Elizabeth,  why the obsession  with Celine Dion?  Do you want to,  like,  munch her pots or something?  I am not obsessed  with her at all.  I don't even know.  You want to bump donuts  with her?  What's the deal?  Yeah,  that's it.  You want to bump donuts 
[01:25:00]  with that skinny bitch?  Yeah,  that's exactly what it is.  With that camel toe?  You're right.  You like the camel toe.  What is your problem?  I need to know  what your problem is today.  You guys,  just piss me off today.  You want my camel toe,  don't you,  Elizabeth?  Elizabeth,  we're in a bad mood  to begin with today.  We don't need your crap.  Oh,  come on,  guys.  I listen to you.  Put on a strap-on  and slam into me  like the mighty Titanic  slammed into me.  It pisses me off.  I'm just,  you know,  you would,  Elizabeth,  there's too many people. 
[01:25:30]  Elizabeth,  are you on the rag today?  Is that what it is?  They got a heavy flow today?  You're flowing like the water  was flowing into  the watertight compartments.  I shouldn't let you guys  to be so upset really  is what it is.  What type of tampons  do you use?  People listen to you.  They use the big pads,  OB,  designed by women gynecologists.  No applicator?  You use your finger?  What kind are you using today?  Elizabeth,  do you have seagulls  following you today?  Are you flying  on the wings of a maxi?  I don't even,  I don't even.  I don't understand  why you're so angry 
[01:26:00]  over a stupid  Celine Dion bit.  Celine Dion,  guys,  I'm trying to make  a point to you  that it's just,  why don't you talk  about something  of substance  and then go off  about it?  We talked about  the whole Diallo case.  What kind of news  is it that Celine Dion?  We talked about addiction  yesterday with Daryl Strawberry.  Go off on,  you know,  I mean,  talk about,  you don't even know  what's going on  in the small burbs  on the,  about Diallo.  There is a,  there is a wake,  there is an aftermath  coming to this.  White kids,  white middle class kids  are pissed at us.  All right,  I'm on a nearby train. 
[01:26:30]  You guys picked me off  today.  You're both the listener  and I'm going to try  and I'm going to go again.  I'm just,  that's it.  Elizabeth?  Yeah.  Go to hell.  Thanks, Opi.  There she goes.  Hang up.  She's all upset.  Hang up.  Bye-bye, Elizabeth.  You're on the rag today.  It'll,  it'll pass,  okay?  Yeah.  You'll call and apologize.  No, I won't.  Yes, you will.  Elizabeth,  I got to hang up.  Tom Green's on the line.  Much more important person  than you,  you bitch.  Tom Green.  Hello? 
[01:27:00]  Tom?  Tom.  Tom, is it you?  Yeah, how you doing?  Is it you?  Tom?  What's happening?  Are we on the radio right now?  Yeah.  We're on the radio, Tom.  We're actually on the air.  Hey, I almost got your voice down.  What's up, bro?  We're big fans.  Oh, wow.  Thanks.  That's exciting.  You know, I'm excited today.  Do I sound excited?  Yeah, you do.  You sound very excited, yes?  Because I'm excited  because we have this,  because we have a big special  on our show tonight.  Yeah, I know.  You got Monica Lewinsky, I hear.  Yeah, it's, you know,  yeah.  Did you get a Hummer offer?  What's that?  Did you get a Hummer? 
[01:27:30]  Did I get a Hummer?  Yeah, you know, a Hummer.  No, we didn't get a Hummer  for this one.  If you're that close to Monica,  you should get,  you should get,  you know,  whip it out.  See if she'll hob it.  Did she get...  Did she like Hummers, or?  No, she loves it.  I didn't even know  she liked Hummers.  See, I screwed everything up.  I didn't even know that.  Not the vehicle, Tom.  We don't have, like,  a lot of, sort of,  we don't have a budget  for, like, researchers.  We didn't even know  she liked Hummers  and our show's finished.  It looks like you don't have  a budget for months  on that show, 
[01:28:00]  but we love it, man.  We're just trying to,  you know, make it up  as we go along.  What's the term  they use in Canada  for a BJ?  See, in America,  we like using Hummer.  Oh, really?  Oh, okay.  I've never even heard that term.  What are you doing  with the fat whore?  Hey, hey, Tom.  I thought you guys  were talking about the car.  Tom, it's nuts.  It's Andrew Dice Clay.  I enjoy your show.  What are you doing  with the fat whore?  Huh?  Is that really  Andrew Dice Clay?  Yeah, he stops in  every so often.  Yeah, he has nothing  better to do, Tom,  so he stops by our show. 
[01:28:30]  You got Monica Lewinsky?  What do you do  with the whore?  Huh?  Yeah, I know.  I was excited.  I took her to my home team.  You banged that fat ass, Tom.  Is that what you do  on your show?  You bang a big fat ass?  Wow, listen to that.  Dices.  Which one of you guys  are doing that?  Is that Opie or Anthony?  That's actually  Andrew Dice Clay.  Oh, is it really?  Yeah.  It wasn't Opie  doing an impression?  I tried dropping  to do plugs  for my gig  at Bananas  and Rascals.  Or Anthony? 
[01:29:00]  And I'm playing  I'm playing  air swipes  up in Poughkeepsie.  My career's flying.  I once sold out  Madison Square Garden  and now  I can't sell out  the Olive Garden.  Oh!  Seriously,  which one really  was it, though?  That's actually  Dice.  No, it's not.  No, it's not.  Don't you hear us  all talking  at the same time?  I was drinking water  while the Dice  was talking.  Oh, it's like  sort of a ventriloquist.  Yes, exactly.  Tom, I said...  I understand.  See, I'm not stupid. 
[01:29:30]  I don't know  what Hummer means.  I don't know  what you're going for.  So, Tom,  tell us about  the show tonight, please.  Oh, it's, you know,  I took Monica Lewicki  up to my hometown  for five days.  Yeah, you're Canadian, right?  Yeah, yeah.  I'm from Ottawa.  I'm from Ottawa.  Ottawa?  Ottawa, yeah.  It's Ottawa.  It's a Native  North American  Indian term  for, I think it means  man who chews tree bark.  And I took her up there  and we actually  went around the town.  We were looking  for fabric,  but the kind of  fun thing that happened 
[01:30:00]  was the Canadian media  kind of went crazy  because they wanted  to get a picture of her.  Yeah, yeah.  And so it turned  into the Tom  and Monica Lewinsky  get chased  by crazy reporter's show.  Now, were you  finding fabric  for her bags?  Yeah, she's got  this handbag company  that she's doing.  So we were sort of,  we actually are  introducing a new  handbag line.  It's called  the Richard and Mary  Jane Green handbag.  Oh, no.  My parents.  Yes, of course.  We went into my parents,  I go into my parents' 
[01:30:30]  room sometimes  at four o'clock  in the morning.  Yeah, we've seen that.  We like the cow's head  is my favorite episode  ever, man.  A message  from Don Coley.  Oh, thank you.  Yeah, well,  we brought Monica Lewinsky  this time  into the room.  Yeah.  And my parents  were surprised.  Did your father  get a Hummer?  Yeah, you should've  got your father  like, you know,  a Hummer.  A Hummer.  See, I like that kind of,  I'm just going to ask  from here, Chris,  Chris, you're from Wisconsin.  Have you ever heard  the term Hummer before?  Really?  I don't know what that is. 
[01:31:00]  How about this?  Hob, how about  Hob some Knob?  I've heard, I mean,  it said Hob some Knob.  Hob a Knob.  He figured it out.  Yeah.  Yeah.  God, was your dad  freaking when he wakes up  and there's Monica  in the bedroom?  He looked surprised.  I guess.  Yeah, yeah.  How's she looking  these days?  What's kind of fun  about the show, though,  is that people are going  to, you know,  they're going to kind of  look at Monica Lewinsky  a little differently,  I think.  It's the first time  you've really seen her.  I mean,  it's an hour-long special  and it's just me and her  sort of traveling 
[01:31:30]  around the city  and she's actually  pretty funny.  You see the fun side  of her.  Yeah, the fun side  instead of her back side.  Huh?  So she's selling bags now?  She's selling bags.  Yeah, she's had a few  across the bridge  of her nose.  I guess she's an expert.  Oh, Dice,  come on, man.  Sorry about that,  Mr. Grant.  That's fine.  He's got to calm down.  That's fine.  He doesn't get out.  Hey, how are you  like in L.A.?  Because you used to be  right around the corner  here in New York.  And you wouldn't come  and see us live  for some reason.  I don't think I was  ever invited, actually.  Yeah, we called up MTV 
[01:32:00]  and got them all pissed off.  He said,  we know Tom Green's there.  Get him on the phone now.  We want him to come over.  And they're like,  you know,  you've got like 50 people  between you.  So they're passing the buck  and they wouldn't  give you the phone.  They forgot about us  or something.  I don't know.  Yeah.  Wow, well,  I mean,  that's too bad  because we're not  around the corner anymore.  I know.  I know.  How are you like  in L.A., though?  It's pretty warm.  Yeah.  It's pretty fun.  I mean,  I was just up in Canada  and down here 
[01:32:30]  it's a lot warmer.  So that's nice.  Yeah.  I got to ask you  about last week's episode.  It was an old tape  when you were on a talk show  and you brought  the dead raccoon out.  Oh, yeah.  That show's called  Mike Bullard.  It's a Canadian show, yeah.  How bad does that thing smell, man?  And why didn't you puke?  Well,  I'm used to the smell  of rotting carrion.  Did you see that episode, eh?  Yeah.  It brings out the raccoon?  After a while,  you kind of just get accustomed  and acclimated  to the smell 
[01:33:00]  of rotting flesh  when you're around it a lot.  Wow.  But we,  it was actually  a three-month-old carcass.  I know, I know.  Yeah,  you do a couple of things  with dead animals  and when he brought  the cat to the vet  and it was dead  in the carrion,  the dead cat.  Can you save my cat?  You know,  we go on all these  road trips with the show.  We're always kind of driving  and sometimes we kind of  run out of ideas  because we're making  a lot of stuff up  as we go along  and there's always  these great props  just lining up. 
[01:33:30]  Just dead props.  You're driving around  with a video camera  making, you know,  wacky TV  and you see a dead moose.  Yeah.  You pretty well  have to get out  and hump it.  I saw that one as well, man.  You can't really  look yourself in the eye  in the mirror that night  if you don't get out  and hump it.  Hey, Tom,  you've got to be making  some good money these days.  Why the bad phone?  Does the phone sound bad?  Because I'm hearing you guys, too.  It sounds like  one of those  Sports Illustrated  football phones.  Yeah, I know. 
[01:34:00]  I mean,  I don't know what's going on.  A second ago,  I don't know,  it's a Panasonic  and a second ago  I hit a button on it  and it started playing  radio out of the speaker  and it took me  about 10 minutes  to figure out  how to turn it off.  Maybe I'm just,  I'm stupid.  I don't know how phones work  and I don't know  what Hummer means.  Why did you leave  New York, though?  It was just kind of,  I don't know,  I love New York, too,  which was just kind of, 
[01:34:30]  ended up the whole show,  ended up moving out here.  I'm not even sure  of the reason,  to be honest.  You just left.  You just left.  You had it with  New Yorkers, huh?  No, I mean,  New Yorkers,  because there was,  I mean,  I was enjoying it a lot  because there was  a lot of people  over there in,  I mean,  a guy in Long Island  tried to hit me  with a hammer once.  I mean,  that's not a reason  to leave  because we,  I mean,  that's great  when people are trying  to hit you with hammers.  That's sort of  a free fit for us. 
[01:35:00]  Right, right.  Sometimes we have  to head up  to the East Coast  a little bit  on road trips now  just because people  are a little bit  too relaxed down here.  Will we be seeing  any more of you  puking?  Jesus Christ,  you have more vomit.  More vomit  on your show, man.  That's pretty  friggin' rank.  My favorite  Tom Green show  is when you drove  some of the audience  members home?  Yeah,  out to Rockland.  Rockland County  and then you were  taking showers  and stuff 
[01:35:30]  and God damn,  was that funny.  They all got mad at me.  Yeah.  They all got mad  and they called  the cops on you.  I don't know what,  I mean,  it was kind of a weird  sort of transition  that night  because everyone  was sort of all  gung-ho.  They were all  a bunch of kids  that had come down  to our audience  and they were all  really excited  to be getting  on our little  school bus  for this little trip  but then it,  I guess it took  about six hours  to drive everyone home.  Yeah.  We all lived  in different parts  of town  and by the time  the last kid  was there  he was ready  to kick the crap  wasn't it like  3 a.m.  or something like that? 
[01:36:00]  Yeah,  it was pretty well  three or four  by the time  we got the last kid home.  That was very,  very creative  and very funny.  Hey,  what happened  on the Donnie  and Marie show  recently?  You were cutting  up their wardrobe  or something?  Oh,  yeah,  because part of the,  it was sort of  the whole fabric thing.  Monica wanted  some fabric  for her handbag company  so I did cut  the back of Donnie  and Marie's jacket  off.  Jackets off.  I think we're  going to make  a handbag out of them.  Very nice.  Handbag.  All right, 
[01:36:30]  so the show's on  what time tonight  for everyone  that doesn't know?  I'm surprised.  10 o'clock  on MTV.  Right.  I mean,  we're really excited  about it  because it's the first  time we've had  an hour-long show  and it's also  the first time  we've had  a high-profile guest.  Oh,  yeah,  this is huge.  Miss Lewinsky,  so it's exciting.  Do you kiss her?  Do you kiss her  on the mouth?  I don't actually.  Well,  I don't want to say.  You'll have to say.  Tom,  I think you failed.  I think you should have  got someone a Hummer.  I think you owe it  to your dad. 
[01:37:00]  You should have  got your dad a Hummer.  Chris,  Chris,  from what's,  what's a Hummer?  You know,  the hob of the knob  Hummer?  Oh,  come on,  guys.  A knob hobbin.  Or you should have  had her bumping donuts  with your mom there.  I really didn't know,  but I think,  you guys,  when you see the show,  when you see the show,  I think you probably  won't be as hard  on Miss Lewinsky.  Hey,  you said hard on.  I,  I,  you're right. 
[01:37:30]  Sitting here was the  former head writer  of Beavis and Butthead  and they just said,  you said hard on.  He knew,  he knew it,  he was saying it  at the same time  as you.  Oh,  really?  Yeah,  he,  he worked,  our head writer was,  used to be the head writer  of Beavis and Butthead.  Oh,  really?  Yeah,  Chris Brown from Wisconsin.  Wow,  he's like a hero.  He's another one  of our heroes.  Hey,  Tom,  you can't be a stranger,  man.  You've got to call  our show from time to time.  You've got a lot of fans  that listen to us.  Oh,  well,  hey,  thanks for having us.  You can't wait for,  like, 
[01:38:00]  someone like Monica Lewinsky  to come on your show.  You've got to,  like,  just call us every once in a while.  Yeah,  I will for sure.  Let us know what's going on.  I will for sure.  All right,  man.  All right,  Tom.  Thanks,  man.  We'll,  we'll check it out tonight,  all right?  Yeah,  thanks,  guys.  Thanks,  Tom.  Tom Green,  everyone,  from MTV.  We've got to take a break.  We were in the middle  of commercials there,  weren't we?  Yeah,  we're fine.  All right,  we'll be back.  Stay there.  Well,  that was cool,  huh,  Anthony?  Oh,  what?  You never know  who's going to,  like,  call the radio show.  Tom Green,  of all people,  had no idea he was calling in.  Yeah.  If any other celebrities  want to call the show today, 
[01:38:30]  by all means,  pick up the phone  and dial away.  We'd love to hear from you  today,  okay?  We love you,  celebs.  Or if you're in the area,  just stop on by the show.  Yeah,  pop in,  we don't care.  All right,  phone line 212-757-1027.  We're in the middle  of spots here,  Anthony.  It's Stacker 2,  the world's strongest  fat burner.  We've talked about  Stacker 2  for over a year now.  Sorry,  I hope I'm eating.  Are you going to need  a Stacker 2  after slamming down  that huge sandwich  of yours,  Anthony?  No,  I don't think 
[01:39:00]  I'm that fat a guy.  No,  okay.  But if I was,  I would take Stacker 2.  I'm just really famished  after being chased away  from where we were eating  after a mere couple  of bites of my sandwich.  Yeah,  we did have lunch plans,  but they were rudely  interrupted today.  Oops.  Stacker 2,  the world's strongest  fat burner,  Anthony,  it does three things.  It burns the fat  off your body.  Yeah.  It crushes the cravings  to snack in between meals.  Yes.  And it gives you  a boost of energy  when you're feeling  a little sluggish  late in the day.  You know what I'm saying? 
[01:39:30]  It adds up to losing weight.  Losing weight.  Lots of people have tried it,  thousands of people,  matter of fact.  If you want to try this  for yourself,  give Stacker 2 a call.  Their phone number  is 1-800-LIGHTLINE.  That's 1-800-L-I-T-E-L-I-N-E.  Or check them out  on the internet,  www.stacker2.com.  Stacker 2,  the world's strongest  fat burner.  Thousands have proven  it works.  Give them a call.  1-800-LIGHTLINE.  What is it going to take  for us to piss you off  to the point  where you're going  to change the station?  That's what I need to know.  Shove it.  Anthony. 
[01:40:00]  Boy, it sure is easy  to be a fag on this show,  isn't it?  That's going to be trouble.  Opie and Anthony.  We just received  a Ph.D. in stupidity.  1-0-2-7.  W-N-E-W.  I like it.  Like it a lot, man.  We're always into  checking out new stuff.  That's a New York City band  called Dope  and Everything Sucks,  Anthony.  That's pretty good.  I like the groove.  Sounds a little bit  like Zombie, right?  Yeah.  A little bit.  They've been on tour  with Megadeth,  Orgy,  Static Axe,  Cold Chamber,  and Power Man 5000, 
[01:40:30]  which is Rob Zombie's  little brother's band.  Yeah.  And Everything Sucks  is off their debut album,  Felons and Revolutionaries,  Anthony.  Now available at all  63 Sam Goody locations  in the New York area.  Dope.  Check them out.  All right?  We're pretty good.  I was only going to  play like a piece of it,  put it rocked,  and we had to...  Yeah, you can't cut that off.  No, you can't cut that off.  I mean,  this song's not as good  as We Deliver Keggers,  I understand,  but...  No,  that has a nice  little attitude there.  Yeah.  All right, 
[01:41:00]  let's go back to the phones.  If you've got something  for the show,  212-757-1027,  fax line 212-957-9639.  Once again,  I want to thank  Tom Green from MTV  for checking on in today.  Yeah.  A lovable  flaphead Canadian.  Yeah,  he's got an hour-long show  tonight with Monica Lewinsky.  A special,  a very special episode  of Tom Green  tonight on MTV.  I bet they told him  he couldn't do  a few things  that he probably  wanted to do.  With what?  Monica?  Yeah,  you know,  she's got people  that say,  you know,  don't mention the BJ. 
[01:41:30]  Yeah.  You know,  gee,  what made her famous?  She BJ'd the president.  Oh,  but don't mention the BJ.  Imagine that.  You're famous  for something.  Now you're all over TV  and everything.  You're famous  for a BJ.  And now,  you can't mention  the BJ.  To that person.  Isn't that something?  That would suck.  That would really suck.  Yeah,  just talk about it.  Hey,  Monica,  so how was the BJ?  You know, 
[01:42:00]  that would be funny.  Yeah.  Tom Green talking like that.  And then he grabs  a cow udder  and starts  maybe trading techniques.  Oh,  man,  I want to talk  to him about that.  Yeah.  The sickest Tom Green episode  when he was sucking  on the cow udder.  And it looked like  a guy's thing,  man.  Yeah,  it looked like  he was doing the deed.  I'm very surprised  MTV allowed us  to talk to Tom Green  with all the abuse  we sent their way.  Maybe they forgot.  We better remind them.  Maybe they know  who reaches  the 18 to 49  male demo. 
[01:42:30]  Explain it to them.  All right,  let's go to Karen.  Karen,  you're on Andy W.  What's up?  What's up,  Opie and Anthony?  Hello.  How are you doing?  Pretty good.  Opie,  I saw you  on the wedding  on Friday  and I was going  to ask you.  I kind of chickened out  because Sandy  was standing right there.  Uh-oh.  But I wanted to ask you  about Lesbian for a Day.  You want to be  Lesbian for a Day?  Yeah.  This girl was hot,  Anthony.  I was at his wedding  on Friday,  my cousin's wedding.  Really?  I didn't know  you went that way.  She related.  Opie was kind of  a wall-stop flower 
[01:43:00]  a little bit.  He didn't really dance  that much,  because of the  road show,  I guess.  I was exhausted  at that wedding Friday.  I was surprised  I was still on my feet.  I danced one dance.  You had like 30 seconds  from the show.  Well,  I didn't even talk  about the wedding,  Anthony.  Yeah.  My cousin Jimmy's wedding  on Friday.  It was a great time  there in Smithtown.  I was really,  really tired.  But it's really,  there's a couple things  I want to mention.  First of all,  to my relatives.  Yeah.  You've known me  my whole life.  You don't have to sneak  pictures of me 
[01:43:30]  to bring back  to your co-workers.  Just ask me  and I'll take a picture  with you.  Yeah,  that's pretty funny.  Do you have that  happening at like  distant relatives  and stuff?  No,  most of my relatives  will just drag me over.  My cousins and stuff  will put me in my place  any time  and my uncles  but it's like  the distant relatives  that I see maybe,  I don't know,  every five years.  Snapping pictures.  I'm eating some  of the wedding cake  and stuff  and all of a sudden  I see a flash.  My brother goes,  you see that?  You know,  Uncle Wawa  is like sneaking  pictures of you.  I'm like, 
[01:44:00]  why is he sneaking  pictures of you?  Just ask.  I'll take a picture  with the guy.  Yeah.  So that was going on  and then I got talked  into going on the dance floor  to do one dance  with my 90-year-old grandma.  Oh,  no.  We had the cute grandma dance  where she was dancing  on the dance floor,  Anthony.  And then all the...  Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na.  No,  no.  I have to speak  in obvious defense.  He did not do  the electric slide  or anything like that.  So I'm just...  Karen,  did I do any  of that goofy crying?  no,  he really seriously  only danced  like 30 seconds 
[01:44:30]  to a minute.  Yeah.  Yeah,  and that was just  for my grandma.  She's going to be 90  in like two months  so they thought  it'd be cute  to get all the grandkids  dancing around grandma.  Ah,  there you go.  So I did that for a little while, but they started the conga line.  Yeah.  And a bunch of people were laughing at me because they all know how I feel about that stupid dance.  Yes, the conga line.  And they had to take it out of the reception hall and the hallways and stuff.  The conga line's wacky.  It's going out into the hallway.  Look, oh, no, it's in the kitchen. 
[01:45:00]  No, I, no.  You have to admit that DJ was pretty good.  He was, yeah, he was cool.  He was all right.  He was all right.  Did the DJ come and talk to you?  No, no, no.  That was pretty good.  When they do that, he was really, really loud, though.  Yeah, he was.  He needed to turn down his microphone just a little bit.  We could hear you quite nicely there.  Yeah.  When I was the best man at Joe Curry's wedding, the DJ comes over and he gives me the mic for the speech and goes,  Here you go.  He goes, now try to hold it a little bit away from your mouth and tip it down a little. 
[01:45:30]  I'm looking like, dude, I think I know how to use a microphone.  It's like, thank you, Skippy.  That's like my job.  I don't tell you how to put the damn fry-o-lator basket back in the oil.  So, Karen, you want to be a lesbian for a day, huh?  Sure, why not?  You want to come down here so Ann can get a look at you?  Now.  Why?  You're close?  No, I just have some work to do, but I can put it off.  You're not a relative, is you?  No, I'm his cousin's best friend. 
[01:46:00]  Oh, I thought you were doing my cousin.  No, no, no.  No, actually, I'm doing his other friend.  Wait a minute.  You're doing Ope's cousin's friend?  Okay, so no, there's a long story.  But you go to the wedding with the cousin?  Anthony, there's a long story there.  I actually met Ope's cousin on the Internet of all places.  Who, Michael?  Yeah, Michael.  What, is he a serial killer Ope?  Well, he is.  No, he's been in here.  He's really, really into that.  I'm just saying.  He has like five screen names and stuff, and he goes and tries to pick up chicks.  Oh, my God, the Internet.  He's definitely related to it. 
[01:46:30]  I mean, he gave it up.  He gave it up.  He went to the Navy.  He gave it up.  He doesn't do that anymore.  He's stationed in Chicago now, Anthony.  Yeah.  He's in the Navy.  So, he picked you up on the Internet?  Yeah, he picked me up on the Internet, right?  And then, like, I meet his best friend like a month later, and I start going out with him.  Actually, I broke up with Michael to go out with his good friend.  They're not friends anymore because of me, but whatever.  Did you hob my cousin's knob?  Yeah, actually, I did.  Oh, wow. 
[01:47:00]  He's probably going to, like, listen to this.  I don't want to be like.  I'm making tapes to send to him.  Oh, I'm sure you are.  I'm sure you are.  If he misses the show, I'm going to send a few tapes to Chicago.  Wow.  You really hobbed his knob?  Well, I was dating him for, like, a month, so, before I met Matt.  His other friend.  And then what happened with this Matt guy all of a sudden?  I'm actually still with Matt, and it's going to be, I think, a year and three quarters.  No, but I mean, like, all of a sudden you met Matt, and then what made you stab Opie's  cousin in the back and go off with Matt? 
[01:47:30]  No, actually, actually, the relationship wasn't really going anywhere, and we just kind of,  like, we liked each other, but there wasn't anything happening, so.  Does my cousin have the family blessing?  Uh, I don't know.  I haven't tasted any other family members, so I really wouldn't know.  No, I mean, like, you know, the family blessing.  I mean, how big is he?  Oh, he's, um, I don't know, in my experience, average.  Oh.  There you go.  I'm not allowed to know.  No, it's only half a week now.  Come on.  I feel like more than average. 
[01:48:00]  Yeah, and now with the new guy, have you given up the balloon knot for him?  Uh, actually, yeah.  All right.  All right.  Um, I'm making a tape right now in the center.  Um, he's, uh, he lives in Long Island, and I live in the city.  Yeah.  So, um, so we all get to see each other, so, like, in honor of the Tuesday Night Hummer,  which he never gets, I figured I'd be lesbian for a day.  Very nice.  Yeah.  Give up the balloon knot.  She's giving, this girl's giving up the balloon knot, man.  She's a balloon knot.  And she's hobbed my clothes knot.  Not all the time, no, maybe, like, once or twice, but, you know, a special occasion. 
[01:48:30]  Yeah, that's a special occasion.  Special occasions, like, you know, Christmas, and Leap Year, which is today, so get your  ass down here.  Yeah, it's not like, turn around, honey, hey, why not, you know?  It's...  Groundhog's Day, you see if, you know, it pops out.  Have a shadow.  Or something.  Every Monday.  Well, very nice.  Um, yeah, you can come on down.  All right, cool.  Be a lesbian for a day.  Okay, awesome.  Um, I'm going to need directions, though.  Erection?  What?  Yeah, I'm going to need directions to the studio.  You'll have enough erections. 
[01:49:00]  You know what, I mean, this show is going nowhere fast today.  If you want to get down here today, we'll set up lesbian for a day tonight.  No problem.  All right, if there's any girls out there, I did see this girl, Karen, at a wedding last  Friday.  She's definitely, uh, cute.  She's got some big fun...  Oh, thanks, Opie.  She's got some big fun bags.  Yeah.  What size?  Um, it depends, because, like, I go in and out, but I'm, like, 36 feet to, like, 38 feet.  All right, all right, how tall?  Uh, 5'9".  Karen, Karen, all right, I've got to be honest. 
[01:49:30]  Yeah?  Someone smelled really bad at the wedding.  You're not implying odor.  I don't know.  Did you have a little odor going on?  Uh, actually, I don't have a sense of smell.  What?  I wasn't born with one.  You weren't born with a sense of smell?  I wasn't born with a sense of smell at a defective olfactory, whatever, that he explained  it to me a long time ago.  Okay, that was not great.  You wouldn't even have to shower.  If it was me, I apologize, Opie.  I'm sorry.  That would make sense.  I don't think it was me.  I showered and I deodorized.  Right, you could just blast farts in front of her. 
[01:50:00]  I'd blast it on her face.  She wouldn't know.  You can't smell anything?  I can't smell anything, dude.  No.  There's only just one thing I can smell.  I can smell a room filled to capacity of smoke.  And then, like, if a house is burning down, I'll know it.  Yeah.  But I'm hopeful that people kicked in before that.  Hey, hey, screw the lesbian for a day.  Someone go out and get some White Castle, man.  This is more fun than doing lesbian for a day.  So, like, when you cut one, you know, when you're black.  I don't want to cut one.  I have no idea. 
[01:50:30]  No, but if you do, you don't even know what it smells like when people are going, oh,  oh, that's terrible.  You've never smelled anything in your life?  Never smelled anything in my life.  So you don't even know what it is to smell?  Nope.  Do you taste stuff?  Yeah, see how it works is, like, the part of my nose that would work when I smell, it's  defective.  So, like, everything else works as if I have smell.  Yeah.  But when I'm supposed to smell, it doesn't work.  No wonder she gives up the balloon knot.  That area's nothing for her.  You know? 
[01:51:00]  Guy, girl, it doesn't matter.  It's all the same to her.  You obviously would have no problems giving hummers then.  Rusty trombones.  Rusty trombones, you could pretty much go for it.  I've actually never done that, but...  Oh, wow.  You're holding out.  I'm holding out.  Well, all right.  Let's try to set you up.  Any girls out there want to go out with Karen today on the lesbian couch?  How old are you?  You're, like, 20.  20.  I was going to say 21, 22.  Yeah.  Yeah, I couldn't go out of the road show.  I wanted to come out, but, you know, you don't do anything cool for us. 
[01:51:30]  20 years old and no sense of smell.  That's great.  Well, so far, we have no takers, Karen.  I can't understand that.  Aw, man.  She's definitely cute.  She can't smell.  She's got, like, handicap plates for that or something.  That seems like something that's kind of a handicap.  We should have her smell stuff that we would never smell.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, I'll have someone just blast one right in her face.  Rick will do it.  All right, Karen, hold on the line.  Okay.  All right.  We're trying to get lesbian for a day happening today.  The lesbian couch hasn't had a workout in a while. 
[01:52:00]  Too bad Stinky wasn't here.  Karen is definitely a good candidate.  Could rub his armpit in her face.  She sounds like she'd be a lot of fun.  Any ladies in the area that want to come on down?  We want to try to make this happen today.  All right.  Rock.  I can't read that, Rick.  You can read that.  What did he write?  Just over the top.  Chris from Jersey on the instant feedback.  Oh, Rick.  I believe what Rick is trying to say is that with Karen having no sense of smell, hygiene 
[01:52:30]  isn't much of an issue with the girl if she wants to come down here.  She came over with a bunch of friends to meet me at the wedding.  Yeah.  And someone in that group really smelled.  Like what, B.O.?  So I couldn't get past the smell to, you know, check her out until later on.  Was it upper body smell or lower body smell?  It definitely smelled like underarms.  Upper body.  Upper body.  So we got instant feedback here from Chris from Jersey.  All psychopaths. 
[01:53:00]  All psycho-marked psychopaths.  Yes.  Attention.  Channel 2 and Channel 4 are going to be on campus of Mount Clare State University.  Oh.  There's a fire in one of the dorms and the students are complaining about unsafe living conditions.  Channel 2 and 4 will be at the campus of Mount Clare State University, probably starting at 5.  Yeah.  You know what to do.  You know what to do.  Rock.  The psychopaths were out in force last night at Raw's War at the garden. 
[01:53:30]  I want to thank all you guys for helping our cause, okay?  Sure thing.  Yeah, we need our first live wow on TV.  We got to bring this to the next level.  Females.  We need some females to do some wowing when you see the live, you know, shots going on.  Live wow.  Yes.  All right.  All right.  I got to go back to Karen.  No takers yet.  Aw.  Karen, it's not looking good.  Aw, no.  Maybe I made you sound too, like... 
[01:54:00]  Too sweet or something?  Not too sweet.  No, I think the whole body odor thing might be turning off some ladies.  But I can't say for sure it was you.  Okay.  I'm going to go with that then.  Have you ever kissed a girl?  Oh, absolutely.  You have?  Actually, my first experience, I was 16, and I was actually dating, quote-unquote, whatever  you can call it in high school.  This 19-year-old.  And she, you know, it was the whole, like, she taught me everything I know, showed me the 
[01:54:30]  ropes kind of thing.  And then when she was four with me, she just, you know, didn't call or nothing.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  So I was kind of scorned, so I didn't go that route for a while, but it's definitely  been a while.  Would you get real wild today?  Yeah.  Sure.  Why not?  All right.  Bring in the lesbian couch, boys.  Well, Karen, get your ass over here.  We'll try to figure something out.  All right.  All right.  All right.  No problem.  Hold on.  Rick's going to talk to you.  Okay.  We'll do something. 
[01:55:00]  Sounds like she's willing to have some fun, Anthony.  Yes.  And we could use some fun today, can't we?  Yes, we can.  Relax a second, Mark.  You ass.  It's all wound up.  All right.  We've got to take a quick break.  We'll be back.  Our phone line, 212-757-1027.  Opie and Anthony.  Who would you rather nail?  I disqualify myself because I've done them both.  I'm the best, weirdo.  1027-WNEW. 
[01:55:30]  Hey, it's the Opie and Anthony show.  I'm percolating a little bit, Anthony.  We have Karen coming down.  She wants to be a lesbian for a day.  Percolating?  She has no sense of smell.  We want to test out her smelling abilities, Anthony.  A lot of guys donating their services.  One guy on the Instant Feedback.  Where is it?  Dan from Staten Island.  Hey, guys.  I've been wearing sweatpants all day and my... 
[01:56:00]  Has a strong vinegar odor.  Oh, man.  Ask Karen if she thinks the stench would reignite her sense of smell.  That's frigging disgusting.  Very, very funny.  She could date Ziggy.  Yeah, she could.  Like Ziggy.  Oh, that's what we should get.  That's perfect.  Get Ziggy down here.  If we could get Ziggy down.  When is she coming?  By 6 o'clock, let's say?  She's going to be here in a half hour.  Where's the Zigstick?  Rick, go out on the streets of New York and find a smelly bum. 
[01:56:30]  I'm serious.  Yes, find the smelliest one you can.  Is opera man out there today?  He left today?  Smellier than him.  We need someone that's really, really smelly.  Ziggy.  I know.  Ziggy would be perfect, but I don't know if we can get him in time.  I'll call.  Call up or keep the cop.  Put the bat signal out for Ziggy.  It's a big light, like trash can.  I think.  That's an amazing thing, being born without the ability to smell. 
[01:57:00]  A sense of smell is kind of important, you know?  I would have had a lot more fun in college if I had that ability.  A sense of smell.  With that one girl where you had to drive with your hand out the window the whole way home.  All right, all right.  Let's see.  You know?  That's a horrific story.  You'd miss a lot, though.  A sense of smell is kind of important.  I don't know.  Think about it.  What?  That could be a cool thing.  No, sometimes a sense of smell like it gives you a memory of something. 
[01:57:30]  Sure.  It smells like school cafeteria, lunchbox, and it brings you right back, you know?  Stuff like that.  Grandma's cooking sauce in the kitchen.  I like walking around the streets of Manhattan, and you pass by a girl that's wearing, like,  a perfume that, like, some old broad you used to go out with used to wear.  Yeah.  That used to give you, like, the best sex of your life.  Yeah, and all of a sudden, you're just brought right back to that time.  You're like, oh.  Yeah, smells a weird thing, because it could, it's, because I think that's the only thing 
[01:58:00]  that can be exactly the same as it was in the past.  Like, sight isn't, because time has passed by, and touch, I don't know.  It's kind of different, because time has passed.  Well, we have no takers for Karen.  Lisa!  Yes?  You want to be a lesbian?  You wouldn't know if you had dog crap on your ship.  Just keep walking around.  Hold on, Lisa, your phone sucks.  Your phone blows.  Put up, Bob.  Let's try this again. 
[01:58:30]  Lisa!  Yes?  All right.  You want to be a lesbian for a day?  Why not?  Today?  I can't get there today.  Yeah, I'm on Long Island.  I can't get there today.  I can't get there today.  The guy that answered the phone.  We need to make it happen today.  Can't we make it happen tomorrow?  No, because I think we've got enough ladies that are listening to the show that want to  be little radio stars.  We've got the lesbian couch.  It's going to be a radio star.  I'm looking at Karen.  Well, what we'll have to do is hook you up with someone else in the future.  Okay, good.  All right, because Karen is definitely cute. 
[01:59:00]  She's coming down, and we're going to find a lady to be a lesbian for a day with her today.  All right?  What number?  10-7.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  What is with her?  Hey.  Is that a pay phone?  I want to be a lesbian for a day.  I want to pay a phone.  Let me put another in.  Jesus.  Hey, who's this?  Hello?  Yeah, what's up, bro?  You're on the air.  Hey, it's Bobby from Staten Island.  How are you guys?  Hey, thanks, Bobby.  I had a little solution, but you guys are going on it. 
[01:59:30]  Maybe for a lesbian for a day, you can find a girl that's good-looking but doesn't have, let's say, better roses down there,  and see if she would be able to smell that, because that's sometimes pretty nasty.  Well, that's kind of what we were thinking a little earlier, you know.  Well, we'll have to see what she's all about when she gets down here.  I appreciate it.  Thank you.  Well, we definitely need to get a lady down here to the studio immediately to hook up with Karen. 
[02:00:00]  I saw her at the wedding this past Friday.  She's not bad.  What's with that on my side?  Oh, I thought maybe she was coming down.  Debbie.  Yeah.  Do you have no sense of smell either?  No, I never had one.  I couldn't tell you what anything smelled like.  So you have no clue what smell is then?  Nope.  I couldn't tell you what perfume, flowers, food, anything.  And you never had it, so you're not missing anything?  Nope.  Not that I, well, I can drive through parts of Staten Island without being sick, but other 
[02:00:30]  than that.  That's a plus.  What do you think smell is?  What do I think it is?  Yeah.  If you've never had it before.  I don't know.  I always wonder, because people smell, like, they say, oh, I smell bacon, I smell this.  I can't smell anything.  And my sense of taste is off, too.  Really?  Yeah.  You must be a cheap date, because if you can't smell, you really can't taste, so we could just  put any type of food in front of you.  Have the chunk of soy.  Well, I'm not blind.  No, but it's the most unusual thing, but I'm not really missing out on too much that I'm  aware of.  You can't smell cologne. 
[02:01:00]  Huh?  You could be blind.  Jesus.  Well.  Having a sense of smell is a pretty cool thing.  Well, I wouldn't have anything to compare it to.  It makes changing my son's diaper all that much easier, though.  I can imagine.  No, you couldn't.  And you were born without what?  What do you mean?  I don't get it.  How are you born without this?  It's neurological.  It's because, actually, my dentist was amazed by it, and he said, you know, you can't even  get it checked out, because it's neurological.  It's not like you have a deviated septum or anything.  It's in your brain. 
[02:01:30]  Huh?  Is it your brain?  Your olfactory?  I believe so.  I guess mine's not functioning.  Someone know what a clocker in the head.  You know?  Oh, it's been done.  I'll bring back amnesia or something.  Are you volunteering?  If you have amnesia.  Yeah, we'll crack it with a two-by-four.  We'll see if you get your smell back.  Iron Mike will be cracking me?  Yeah.  Well, that's something, though.  Hey, you ever take, like, a big, nasty dump in the bathroom, and then somebody passes by  and goes, woof.  I'll take the fifth on that. 
[02:02:00]  And you wouldn't have a clue.  No, I wouldn't, but I'll take the fifth.  How do you know if you stink?  I don't.  That's why I don't wear perfume.  I don't know.  How do you know?  How do you know if your most intimate of area smells?  I get feedback.  You get feedback, huh?  Uh-huh.  And what do they say?  Haven't had any complaints so far.  You know, cleanliness being next to godliness and all.  Yeah, you better keep scrubbed up.  All right, hold on.  I certainly do.  Hold on.  Karen's calling back here.  What's up?  Karen.  I just wanted to call and tell you guys I was listening to the show as I was getting ready 
[02:02:30]  to come over.  Yeah.  There's no way in hell I'm dating Ziggy.  What, are you crazy?  Well, you can't smell him.  You're not going to date him.  We just want you to smell him.  Oh, okay.  Because let me tell you something.  When we had Ziggy come in for the homeless shopping spree, it was the worst smell Aunt  and I have ever smelled in.  Yeah.  It was, it was, it was beyond belief.  Like we couldn't even be in the same room with him.  No way.  So we're trying to get him down here to test out your, uh, your lack of, your lack of smelling. 
[02:03:00]  But even without a sense of smell, you can still taste if something smells bad.  Oh, is this my perspective?  Say what?  Is this my perspective, girl?  Oh, no.  I'm on Long Island.  Sorry.  It's another girl that can't smell.  She sounds cute.  Too bad.  Yeah.  Well, Karen, when are you going to get down here?  Um, I'm getting on the NR as we speak.  Okay.  So I'll be down in like 15 minutes, 20 minutes.  All right.  Cool.  All right.  We got, we got a bunch of girls, uh, starting to check in now.  Oh, yeah.  We're hoping a few, uh, show up so you can have your choice.  Okay?  All right. 
[02:03:30]  Cool.  All right, Karen.  We'll see you in a little bit.  Debbie, we got to let you go too, all right?  All right.  Thanks, guys.  All right.  There we go.  All right.  I'll see you guys later.  Karen, who's cute, coming down to be a lesbian for a day, and another girl that can't smell  as well.  Let's go to Irene.  Irene, what's going on?  What's up, guys?  How are you?  All right.  I'm going to actually blow off my class at Montclair State.  I was going to go there and flash the cameras, but I'll come down and be a lesbian for the  day.  All right.  Hold on.  We need, we need all our soldiers all over the place.  We'll get another lesbian for a day today.  We need you to flash us some live TV cameras.  No.  I want to come make out some girls. 
[02:04:00]  Well, if you.  I don't want to get arrested, man.  You're allowed to walk around topless in New York State.  Just flash the camera.  Just flash the camera.  And run.  And then we'll have you on the show, and we'll let you have your pick of lesbians.  All right.  Because someone's going to beat you, too, because we need a lady to come down here within the  next half hour.  Okay.  It'll take me about an hour.  All right.  Can we count on you as far as trying to get on TV today?  I'll try.  Camera's going live at Montclair State in a little while.  Definitely.  I'm like a minute away, so I'll be there. 
[02:04:30]  All right.  Be incognito.  10 o'clock news coming up.  Don't be obvious, because they're looking for all you psychopaths at this time.  Yeah, I know.  No, I'll be casual.  Wear something convenient.  And I was walking through Times Square last night on the way to Raw, and there was a couple  news crews, and I notice a lot of the news crews now have, like, armed guards around them.  Armed guards.  I swear to you.  I don't want to be taken out by some armed guards.  So just be incognito.  Yeah, I can't laugh.  All right.  All right, you guys.  All right.  We'll be watching the TV to see if you pull it off today. 
[02:05:00]  All right.  Have fun with lesbians.  Thank you, Irene.  Bye.  Bye.  What's that?  What?  No.  The girls come down here.  Eve, what's up?  Hi there.  Hi.  So, yeah.  So I was calling because I had no sense of taste or smell.  No, huh?  And I lost it in a car accident, so I had it.  In a car accident?  Yeah.  Wow.  What, did you bang your head and that was it, huh?  Well, my head hit a stop sign.  How'd your head hit a stop sign? 
[02:05:30]  I mean, I don't mean to laugh, but...  No, believe me, they call it the big one in my family.  Um, I got thrown out of a car.  Ugh.  And...  You were, you, no seatbelt?  No, it was, uh, it was in 89.  Really?  So they had seatbelts in 89?  Yeah, I went...  It wasn't the law.  Oh, seatbelt...  Ugh.  You know, I am the biggest seatbelt advocate.  Let me, let me give you the other side of that, Ann.  What?  I went to college with two girls.  They would be dead if they were wearing their seatbelts.  Yeah, I love those stories.  They would have been, though.  Great.  They were thrown from the vehicle. 
[02:06:00]  Their car was completely destroyed.  They said...  The cops even said if you had your seatbelts on, you girls would be dead.  Yeah, well...  I'm sure the odds are in your favor if you were wearing a seatbelt.  Yeah.  Of course, but...  I mean, I'd rather, uh...  Take the chance with the seatbelt.  Take the chance, yes, with the seatbelt, because most people just fly through the windshield  out of the car and, uh, they're dead.  And hit stop signs.  Hit a stop sign.  What part of the body hit the stop sign?  My head.  Your head?  At the back of my head.  Flat?  I called to say, because it's worse when you had smell, and then you lose it. 
[02:06:30]  Yeah.  Because there's so many things that you miss.  And you don't smell anything?  No.  Nothing?  And I can't taste anything.  Oh, wow.  What do you miss the most?  What smell do you miss the most?  Oh, the ocean.  The smell of the ocean.  Low tide?  Huh.  Something we all take for granted, I guess, when we smell the ocean.  There's a lot of things that you think about that you just never would even think about.  You know, fresh cut grass in the spring.  Uh-huh.  You know, fire when it's in a fireplace and stuff.  Just all those kind of things you don't even think about. 
[02:07:00]  Can't you kind of imagine it, though?  Like, I'm not smelling, like, fresh cut.  You know what it is?  It's been, like, 10 years.  Like, you know, I can imagine what fresh cut grass smells like right now.  Yeah, but you smelled it, what, like a year ago?  Oh, never.  10 years, 12 years, it's going on, you know?  It's just, you lose it.  Wow.  That's sad.  That blows.  Now, don't you feel so sorry for me?  No, I mean, you're alive, you know?  No.  I mean, it's not like Christopher Reeve is crying for you, you know what I mean? 
[02:07:30]  No, I'm...  If you've got to lose something in an accident, the sense of smell is like, eh, okay, I have to deal with it.  No, but there's a bad side, too.  I moved into an apartment a month ago and had a gas leak, and I didn't know.  Whoa!  Yeah, that's pretty good.  That's pretty wild.  Yeah, you know, it took a friend of mine coming over and be like, oh, my God, get out of here.  Really?  You know, and I do it.  I'm not a match.  All right, Eve.  Well, thanks for sharing your little story today.  No problem, just won't share yet.  Did anything else happen to you in the accident?  That was it, huh?  Yeah.  What did you hit?  A stop sign.  No, I mean, what, did you fly through the... hit another car? 
[02:08:00]  No, like, he hit me, and the car spun around.  Oh, you weren't... wait a minute.  You weren't in the car?  I was in the car.  That's what... they thought I was a pedestrian, but my car... I was driving the car, and the guy hit my car.  The car spun around, and when it spun around, I flew out.  Out the window?  Out the open door.  Oh, the door opened up.  The door opened, and you flew out the door and hit the stop sign.  Oh, man.  Wow.  So, everybody wear their seatbelts.  Okay.  That's our lesson today.  Thank you, Eve. 
[02:08:30]  Bye.  Bye.  Wear your seatbelt.  You don't know what smells you'll be missing.  Sue, what's going on?  You're next on WNEW.  Hi, Opie.  How are you?  Good.  What is that?  Ann, chopped liver?  Yeah, thanks, Sue.  Hi, Ann.  I'm sorry.  I just want to tell you guys, first of all, I think you're great.  And if you can't get somebody in today to actually do a live performance, I have a story that  maybe you'd be interested in.  Yeah?  Yeah. 
[02:09:00]  Okay.  Let me just change my template and go ahead.  This is a little different than the, I guess, the fresh-cut grass.  Loose lesbo.  I was away recently.  Yeah.  And I had my first experience with a girl.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  And?  You can continue.  Sue?  Yeah.  Continue.  Well, I was away with my husband.  We went away.  And we were laying by the pool.  And he was reading some magazine, some local magazine that was advertising for this, some 
[02:09:30]  sort of club they had, scrub club or something.  Oh, my God.  Listen to how this stuff is.  And he was telling me that, you know, it had always been his fantasy to see me with  another girl.  Okay.  Well, he's an original thinker.  So, you're all the same.  Go ahead.  So, anyway, we went to this club.  And I really was very nervous about this.  And, I don't know, the whole scene was sort of... 
[02:10:00]  All right.  I've got to help you along because it sounds like there might be a payoff here.  You're on vacation.  Your husband always wanted to see you with another girl.  You're away from home.  No one's going to know who you are.  You're now in a club.  What happens?  Well, we left.  We went back to the hotel.  And he was so disappointed.  So, he called.  He called this place and asked them if they'd send a girl over.  What place did he call?  This club.  Lesbians R Us?  This club.  It was this club.  Was it a strip club?  No.  What kind of club?  It was like a massage club or something. 
[02:10:30]  This is what they sort of sold themselves as.  And they said you could call up and we'll send chicks over?  Well, they didn't say that.  But he called and determined as he was.  And they agreed to do it.  So, I had agreed...  How much?  How much was it?  Yeah.  200.  And then you had a tip.  All right.  So, they sent over a girl.  So, he said, I agreed that the only thing that I'd be willing to do, they advertise the  sort of like hot lotion massage with light touching. 
[02:11:00]  So, I said, yeah, I said, okay, that's about as far as I'm willing to go.  Anyway, he called.  He said, don't send anybody over here who isn't pretty because, you know, we'll send her home.  And anyway, she came and she was very pretty.  All right.  She came to your hotel.  Yeah.  Right.  And, well, it went further than the hot lotion massage.  Ah, and further than light touching?  Yes.  Did your husband bang her?  No.  No?  No.  He just watched? 
[02:11:30]  Well, first he watched.  First he watched.  Were you both on the bed?  Yes.  She started massaging you with the hot oil?  Yes.  And the light touching?  Yes.  And then what?  She carefully touched your balloon knot or what?  No.  Your whale's eye?  Well...  Were you on your back?  Were you on your belly?  I was on my...  First she told me to make...  Ass up in the air or what?  Just to make sure that we weren't cops that I had to undress.  Okay.  Yeah.  So I took off my dress and I left on just my panties and my underwear. 
[02:12:00]  And then I was...  I got on the bed.  I was on my back and I sort of bent over and put my dress on the floor.  And as I was doing that, she unhooked my bra.  Big boobs?  Me?  I had 34 C.  Okay.  All righty.  Nice little size there.  Sure.  And so then she was just kind of rubbing my back and she was saying, you know, how pretty  I was.  And she was really happy to come because, you know, she was...  I guess they don't always get people that they're into.  Right.  Meanwhile, your husband's tugging the taffy in the corner. 
[02:12:30]  No.  You know, he was still dressed.  So...  And you were pretty much naked at this point?  I had just panties on.  Okay.  Was she hot?  With the girl?  Yeah.  Yeah.  She actually really was.  I thought they might...  Big boobs?  Yeah.  I'd say she was about the same size as I was.  Mohawk?  Triangle?  Triangle.  Triangle.  Nice.  Nice.  Okay.  And...  You?  Mohawk?  Triangle?  Triangle.  Triangle?  Okay, good.  Yeah, but very groomed.  Groomed.  Okay.  And, yeah, so then she took off her pants and her panties and then she said to my husband, 
[02:13:00]  you know, you look pretty warm over there.  So it took him all of five seconds to get his clothes off and then the two of us were on  the bed and I was very, very nervous.  And then, um...  Oh, she's got to move along over here.  Yeah, you got to move along.  You had her moving.  We're trying to hang with you, man.  Okay.  That train is coming. 
[02:13:30]  The train is so close to leaving that station.  The 506 is coming, babe.  Okay.  Let's go.  Well, she went south and I have to say, I really didn't think I would ever like that.  Right.  Well, doesn't your man go south?  Yeah.  Okay.  But this is, you know, not a man.  Yeah, but the girl, I'm assuming, knows, you know, exactly what to do.  I'll have to agree with you on that one.  Okay.  Never kind of believed that.  All right.  Yeah.  She was probably a little softer, a little lighter, right?  Yes, very much so.  She wasn't like painting a fence, right? 
[02:14:00]  No.  Okay.  No.  So she was doing that.  Thank you, Sam Kinison.  I was giving my husband a Hummer.  Got to write the alphabet.  Thank you, Sam Kinison.  All right.  Go ahead.  So she was doing her thing.  I was giving my husband a Hummer.  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  Um, and then we sort of just flipped over, and I was, you know, doggy style.  She was underneath.  He was from behind.  Wow.  It was pretty wild.  You didn't slip one to her by accident?  Who am I?  Oh, sorry.  Look.  Oh, geez.  Look where I ended up. 
[02:14:30]  No.  Maybe next time.  Yeah, a lot of the listeners are complaining.  This is the first lesbian story that the listeners actually are complaining about.  Why?  Because you took a little too long, I think.  Oh, I'm sorry.  And then she took off her clothes.  Is that a typical male?  You're waiting too long?  Well, Joe says Sue is boring.  Another Joe.  Sue is too slow.  Oh.  Um, Scott, get Sue off the air.  Oh, sorry.  Were you bumping donuts with this girl?  Yeah.  Yeah?  How did I feel? 
[02:15:00]  Oh, good.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's good.  All right, Sue.  All right.  Well, thank you for sharing.  I enjoyed the story.  Thank you.  All right.  Take care, guys.  There she goes.  Sue is.  And there she goes.  Saved her.  Anthony Cowbell Bill checking in from Daytona.  How be you?  Hey, what do you say, boys?  We're slapping him.  We're shaking.  Are you hammered down there in Florida?  Well, I just got here, but I plan on it.  Yeah?  What are you doing down there?  Huh?  What are you doing down in Daytona? 
[02:15:30]  Well, I'm on my way to Naples.  I came down to tune up my golf game.  Oh, yeah.  Bill, a huge golfer.  Very, very talented.  Let me tell you, man.  I'm on the 11th floor here looking down at the beach.  Yeah?  I think Big Bust Magazine must be having a convention here tonight.  Unbelievable.  Yeah?  All different colored bikinis.  You know, from my perspective, looking down, it looks like somebody knocked over a jar of...  Beach balls, Bill? 
[02:16:00]  Beach balls.  Peanut M&M's.  You're a mess, man.  It's unbelievable, man.  Say, what, you went down there to play some golf, huh?  Yeah, I'm going to be down here for about three weeks.  Three weeks?  Look at this guy.  Must be nice.  Nice vacation, Bill.  Yeah, man.  Jesus, man.  Well, listen, I'm looking out on the beach here, and as far as stack of two goes,  you guys got to address a group of people that you're kind of missing out on.  And what's that?  People who are in denial. 
[02:16:30]  All right?  This is this guy walking around in a thong, all right, thinking, hey, you know, I'm looking  pretty good.  There's one problem there, buddy.  That's a standard bathing suit you got on there.  Okay?  It's acting like a thong.  Off the beach for crying out loud.  He's blowing the whole picture here.  So you're going to be scoping for some chicks there, Bill?  Yeah, I plan on shucking a few clams in.  I'm working on it, brother. 
[02:17:00]  I'll steal you guys in when I get back.  Hey, what's the story?  You going to mornings or what?  No.  Oh, okay.  We were lying.  We were just messing with everyone.  Oh, okay.  I heard it from your brother.  I don't know.  I guess I got to call my brother.  Yeah, give him a call.  All right, Bill.  All right, boys.  I'm sure you'll have some war stories soon.  Absolutely.  All right, there he goes.  Cowbell bell.  Any visit when I get back.  All right, cool.  Bye-bye.  Later, guys.  Yeah, my brother, things are going in the morning.  Boy, we pulled the wool up.  Everyone's out.  Whoops.  All right, we're still looking for a girl to come down and be a lesbian for a day with Karen, 
[02:17:30]  who's very lovely.  Yeah, come on.  Met her at a wedding this Friday.  We're bringing the lesbian couch into the studio.  If you're in the area, we need you to show up immediately.  Neither do you.  All right, let's take a quick break, and we'll be back.  Stay there.  When calls fall up, you treat them like, you know, good people.  You don't talk down to them.  Hey, f*** you.  Jesus Christ, shut up.  You idiot.  You're such a loser.  Hey, f*** you.  What a retard. 
[02:18:00]  You're high.  Are you stupid?  Hey, f*** you.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  1027 WNEW.  Opie and Anthony.  Who would you rather nail?  I disqualify myself because I done them both.  Isn't that real?  1027 WNEW.  All right, Anthony, what else is going on in the world around us today?  We discussed the Daryl Strawberry thing.  Yeah, boss prays for straw.  Did Steinbrenner find Jesus or something? 
[02:18:30]  Is that what it was?  Well, now that he's older, he's an emotional guy, Anthony.  I mean, did he really get into it or something, you know?  Because it's not the George of old.  Well, he's got a lot of World Series ranks now.  We've got to pray for straw.  Man, yeah.  Poor guy.  We'll give him another chance.  I'm always into giving people more chances.  In the old days. 
[02:19:00]  So we discussed that.  Yeah.  We discussed Kathy Lee quitting Regis and Kathy Lee.  Finally.  A lot of rumors that the bra incident from Letterman had something to do with her quitting the show, Anthony.  Put her over the top.  So we've got to thank the radio chick and Butchie for pulling that off last week.  Eventually, everyone will know it was the radio chick and Butchie that threw that bra on the Letterman stage.  Yeah. 
[02:19:30]  A lot of people talking about it, but no one knows the details.  I think the newspapers were talking to the radio chick and Butchie today, so maybe they'll finally get some ink on that.  Cool.  We discussed Anna Kornikova marrying.  That kills us all today.  And we discussed all the other.  I bet she's a little bitch reg.  Anna Kornikova?  Yeah.  She knows she's hot.  Yeah.  You ladies that are hot, that's the biggest drag, knowing you're hot. 
[02:20:00]  I think she did.  I don't know, though.  And that whole, where is she from?  Russia?  Yeah.  That Russian thing.  Yeah.  You know, good-looking Russian.  I don't know.  She seems like she'd be a real handful.  Oh, Godspeed.  Have fun.  Have fun.  Have fun deflowering our princess.  Shots scored!  I'm going to put a light up on her belly.  He nails it. 
[02:20:30]  Unassisted goal.  Let's go back to the phones, Anthony.  Joe, you're next on WNEW.  Yo, what's up?  What's up, what's up?  What's up, Dreamweaver?  Yo, listen.  Man, you better not be going in the mornings.  Let me tell you something.  I look like a big dick telling everybody that you guys are going in the mornings.  Yeah.  Wait, wait.  You're one of them guys that can't talk without cursing.  My bad.  It looks like you have ten effing heads.  Okay, yeah.  You know, we're not going in the mornings. 
[02:21:00]  No, we're not going in the mornings.  We just felt like messing with the stupid press that think they know everything.  It's not even a consideration.  I was ready to come in.  No, we got a bunch of new radio shows starting, and we hope you guys give the new shows a chance  to, you know, develop here at WNEW.  I'm going to stop listening to Howard altogether.  Listen to you guys.  No, we love Howard.  Oh, yeah.  We absolutely love Howard.  A little bit unfunny.  Tune in in the mornings to Howard on K-Rock. 
[02:21:30]  We love Howard.  Yo, I'm telling you, Raw last night?  We wanted to see what his new TV show is all about.  I'm very curious to see if that's going to be a good show.  Yeah.  It doesn't matter if we don't get FX on you.  All right.  Yo, Raw last night?  Call your cable company.  Want some Raw last night?  Everyone should watch Son of a Beach.  Son of a Beach.  There you go.  What is it?  Son of a Beach, right?  Son of a Beach.  Oh, this guy doesn't shut up.  I'm sorry.  My bad.  All right. 
[02:22:00]  So you were at Raw last night?  Nope.  You weren't at Raw?  Nope.  Okay.  He's an idiot.  So I ran after the phone.  Joe, I'm trying to work with you today.  All right, man.  I've got to go.  Love you guys.  Always listen to me.  Hang up on him before he hangs up.  John, you're next on N.E.W.  What's going on?  Tool.  John.  ONA.  Yes, what's up?  Yo, what's going on?  First of all, before I tell my story,  Hey, I'm on the LAE getting off at Hicksville Road, 106-107.  Yes. 
[02:22:30]  And there's this amazing hot chick in a black Honda Accord with a big-ass wow sergeant on her car.  And I want her to pull over and wow me.  I'm sure she's listening.  You have to help support a wow in progress.  Is she close to you?  She just turned her head around and looked at me.  She's getting ready to pull over to the light.  Let's see if I get some.  All right, why don't you roll down the window, live on the air.  Let's talk you through it, man.  All right, hold on.  She's turning. 
[02:23:00]  There she goes.  Come on, pull over.  All right, she's looking.  Not looking good?  I don't know.  What's she mean?  Oh, wait.  She is listening to us.  Come on, wow me.  In the background.  Here she goes.  Come on, lift them all.  He's begging.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Alive wowing.  Very good, man.  What do you mean? 
[02:23:30]  Give Christine a big, big shout-out for what she just did.  Big nipples.  She just wowed you, huh?  Oh, man.  Fun bags galore.  Well, Christine, thank you very much.  Oh, it's beautiful.  So, anyway, I was getting a Hummer today in a movie theater.  Yeah.  It's a Hummer Tuesday?  Yeah.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  You can't say that.  All right.  Just as I was about to finish the job.  You're at a movie theater getting a Hummer just before you finished.  Yes, go ahead.  The usher came up and caught me and my girl doing it. 
[02:24:00]  But just as he did it and finished.  So, do you ever hear, like, a story when you're in a cafeteria and milk comes out of someone's nose?  Yes.  That's kind of what happened.  All right.  That's how shocked she was.  What movie was it?  I don't even remember.  What was it?  Yeah, sure.  All right, John.  Thank you.  All right.  Bye.  John got wowed.  Let's go to Kevin.  Kevin, what's going on today? 
[02:24:30]  Kevin!  Kevin!  Hello?  Hello, Kevin!  Dude, whoever's on the...  God damn it, Spaz, I'm going to freaking punch him in the head.  He can't get anyone's name right.  Ah!  We sit there yelling someone's name and it's not them and they don't answer.  All right, want to bring Karen in?  God, that pisses me off. 
[02:25:00]  I'm getting no sense of smell either.  And you look sick.  Oh, dude, I'm getting something.  And gets sick like every two years and it's like he's coming down with something.  I don't know what it is.  Hey.  How you doing?  Hey, what's up?  No sense of smell, huh?  Smell her, Aunt?  Hi, how are you?  Smell her.  She really overdid it on the perfume.  Oh, really?  You got paranoid?  Wait, come over here.  I want to smell you.  Paranoid.  Well, she doesn't know.  She puts perfume on and she can't smell.  I wasn't sure if you were the one that was smelling at the wedding. 
[02:25:30]  Wow.  She smells really good.  What happened?  Now, did you wash under your arms before you got here?  Yes.  I think she's showered for you.  I mean, this girl is definitely voluptuous.  She wants me.  Voluptuous.  She is.  You're voluptuous.  That's a good word, right?  Or voluptuous.  Oh, volump.  Volump.  Volump, you wish.  Sorry.  Spell it.  Oh, shut up.  We're having a horrible day.  I might want to smell voluptuous.  Hey, Mike, good to do. 
[02:26:00]  How are you doing?  Hey, baby.  Well, Karen, I think we...  I'll punch you in your old factory and you'll smell again.  I think we scared off all your potential dates by saying you might smell.  Ladies, let me rephrase that.  She does not smell at all.  No.  What perfume do you wear?  Ralph Lauren.  Ralph Lauren.  Yep.  And she smelled the same.  Very sweet.  No, she doesn't smell it.  My roommate gave it to me.  Sit here, put this on.  You don't smell it at all?  Nope.  Hey, Psycho Mark, have her smell your, like, smelly feet.  I want to see if she can smell.  She can smell. 
[02:26:30]  Get spazz?  Spazz has got some rank feet.  Spazz has some rank feet?  Well, I don't want it in here.  Way in the corner, man.  No, it's not if you want, Anthony.  It's okay.  No, because I'll puke if I have to smell spazz.  Karen wants to be a lesbian for the day.  For the day, if there's any girls close to the station, you're crazy not to get your  ass down here to be a lesbian for a day.  Oh.  All right, spazz is taking off his shoe.  The one thing about Karen, if you weren't listening earlier, she cannot smell.  She was born with no smelling abilities, right?  Okay, she's on her knees. 
[02:27:00]  She's in front of spazz.  Hold on.  I got to see this.  Oh, my goodness.  Oh, she's pulling off his sock.  Oh, it smells the sock.  All right, they're real down here.  Mark, are you serious?  It smells that bad over there?  No, it's got to get your shoe off the thing, you meathead.  She's going to be cured.  Oh, my God, look at those toes.  Look at those toes.  God damn.  You're going to lose that toe.  That toe looks like it's going to fall off.  You're going to lose that toe.  I'm serious.  Look at it, man.  You're going to lose that toe.  All right. 
[02:27:30]  Karen, smell spazz's rank feet.  She's all over spazz's foot.  Nothing?  Nothing?  Isn't that disgusting, man?  That's the gross.  Come on.  You can't smell anything?  No, he's smelling nothing.  He's asking a blind man to eat.  You're sure.  All right.  Mark just scratched his smelly you-know-what.  Just stick your finger out to her.  She's smelling his finger.  What are you doing, right?  What are you doing now?  Oh, Rick does have a right smell, too, man. 
[02:28:00]  I've smelled you sometimes.  Not like I'm doing smell.  Take your shirt off.  Take it outside.  All right.  Now she's going to...  I'm going to vomit.  All right.  Now she's smelling Rick's smelly underarm.  Go ahead.  Smell.  Get your nose right in there.  God damn.  That is so weird.  Nothing.  Nothing.  Nothing, huh?  Everybody's pulling off their clothes.  Yeah.  Smell my ass.  Right in there.  Yeah.  Smell the sack.  Hey, we got Kristen on the line who just wowed that guy on the LIE.  I am. 
[02:28:30]  Kristen.  Christine, what's up?  Christine, what's up?  What's up, O.N.A.?  Hey, thank you for wowing that guy.  No, not that.  I was at the road show.  I was wowing everybody at the road show.  Were you really?  Yeah, I was right up front, right in the corner.  By the back door.  By the back door.  Oh, okay.  Right up there.  You had fun at the road show?  Yeah, it was one of the most flammant times I've had in a long time.  Very cool.  Yes, sir.  Steve from the unofficial O.P. & Anthony website put up a ton of brand new clips today, by  the way.  Really?  We're up to like, I don't know, 12 or 15 video clips, at least like a dozen or so still  pictures, so check out what you missed at the road show, www.foundrymusic.com. 
[02:29:00]  Oh, Dad, I want to say you're welcome.  I wow anybody when they pull me over.  Really?  Do you wow guys all the time on the road?  Hey, if they listen to O.N.A., then they deserve a wowing.  Oh, thank you.  Thanks for the support.  We really appreciate it.  No doubt, guys.  All right, man.  Take it easy.  There she goes, Christine.  All right, so Karen, we've got to try to find you a girl.  Yeah.  Hmm.  The girls are like chicken today for some reason.  Is that chick, uh, the school?  Is it because it's Tuesday and they're not giving hummers, or what's the deal? 
[02:29:30]  I don't know.  They're busy.  Yeah.  Busy giving up the back door.  You guys still doing anal Tuesday?  Yeah.  Uh, we only pull out anal Tuesday like once a month.  Oh, yeah?  If you like the back door, huh?  Let's.  Hey, can we see your...  I haven't seen the show.  Come on.  Can we see your Hooters?  Uh, all right.  Why not?  Oh, well, that was easy.  It's only in the name of my boyfriend, though.  All right.  Yeah, of course.  Of course.  No one's going to be...  Always for the boyfriend.  No one's going to be flapping him around or nothing.  It's going to be on the website, yeah.  It's up to you.  We can't put him on if you don't want to.  Let's see. 
[02:30:00]  Oh, very nice.  20-year-old girl.  34 C's, right?  Uh, it's not much.  34 C's?  It's a C, and one of them's a D.  What?  So, it's kind of...  Whoa.  Holy cow.  Turn this way.  Wow.  Let me see that.  That's very nice.  Oh, my goodness.  Those could be the nicest, like, natural breasts I've seen in a long time, man.  Which one's the C?  Which one's the C?  It's obvious.  The right one, man.  That's a C.  And that's a D.  And that's a D?  Yeah, get closer to that so you can check it out. 
[02:30:30]  That's a C.  Wow, look at that.  How'd that happen?  Wow.  She's got huge pink nips, man.  Yeah, it's very hard to distinguish nips from boobs.  It's hard to stop, because you can't just eat.  No, she's got the nice nips, though, where they go for the slow fade.  The slow fade.  I love the slow fade, man.  What do you got, Rick?  Mustard.  You got mustard?  She can't smell mustard.  It smells.  You can't smell that?  Get some of the food out of our fridge. 
[02:31:00]  Oh, my God.  Oh, we got some food that has been in that fridge for, like, months.  We'll cure you.  Well, any ladies want to be with Karen, the lesbian couch awaits.  Very nice breasts there.  Jenny.  What, you're cold?  She's not shy.  I like that.  It's cold.  I know.  As soon as we turn off the mic, she puts the top back on, so we got a stall here.  I got my Victoria's Secret Desire wrong.  Oh, really?  Breaking it in, yeah.  Damn, ladies, where are the lesbians today, man? 
[02:31:30]  We got a good one for you today.  Yeah, yo, have fun with them fun bears.  All right, we got an hour and a half left in the show.  I think we can pull something off.  Yeah, someone will come down.  Look at the guys.  They're begging.  Mark, you want to give out a plea?  A plea.  I'm speechless.  Yeah.  All right.  All girls, we need you.  Come down.  Your country needs you.  This could be the first time. 
[02:32:00]  We're not going to be able to pull off lesbian for a day unless a lady comes out of the woodwork today.  If you're in the area, 57th and 7th, Karen awaits you.  The lesbian couch awaits you.  Her lopsided boobs awaits you.  Can you work that other one?  Can I work the other one?  Yeah, maybe, you know, there's an exercise or something.  No, I can't.  No, they're not.  Maybe I am microponching.  I believe if it swells up a little bit, it'll match pretty good. 
[02:32:30]  It'll just be a little black and blue.  That nip won't be the slow fade.  Believe me, it'll be purple.  All right.  Well, we'll go to the phones and see if we can find someone for you, okay?  All right.  Phone line is 212-757-1027.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Crone men jumping all over each other.  Okay, terrific.  1027-70-NEW.  Come on in, I got to bring it up. 
[02:33:00]  Got to bring it up.  It's rare we ever get anything on Anthony.  What's the problem?  Why?  Ann just asked Ben, who's our ticket broker.  Oh, no, come on.  Ben's our personal concert ticket broker for the O.A. Show.  Helpful reminder.  Why?  So there's all these great concerts coming to town.  Let me just read down the concerts coming to town. 
[02:33:30]  Let's play a little game with the listeners to see what tickets Anthony needs, okay?  And you are a...  Oh, man.  Let me see.  I picked 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 fans coming to town.  You guess which show Anthony wants to go see, okay?  Does Anthony want to go to see the Allman Brothers?  13 nights in March at the Beacon Theater. 
[02:34:00]  Right.  Does Anthony want to see Lit March 4th at Irving Plaza?  Does Anthony want to see 311 March 4th at Roseland?  Okay.  Or could it be Ant needs tickets to see Typho Negative and Coal Chamber?  Yeah.  Now, that's a show that rocks!  Yeah.  March 14th at Roseland.  Does Anthony need tickets for Cracker?  That's a cute little bed, too.  Cracker.  March 20th and 21st at the Bowery Ballroom? 
[02:34:30]  Or does he need tickets for John Paul Jones?  March 28th at Irving Plaza?  Must be corn tickets, right, Ant?  I know you love corn.  April 1st at the Continental Arena and April 8th at the National Coliseum.  Or does Anthony need tickets to see, no doubt, April 6th at Roseland?  Or could it possibly be tickets to see Bruce Springsteen?  Bruce coming to town for like 10 dates.  Let's play, what does Anthony need tickets to? 
[02:35:00]  Allman Brothers, Lit, 311, Typo Negative, Cracker.  John Paul Jones, corn, no doubt, or Bruce Springsteen.  Now, if it was up to me, I'd have a tough choice there.  Do I go see corn, or do I see Typo Negative and Coal Chamber?  Of course.  Let's go to Roger.  Roger?  Yeah. 
[02:35:30]  You want to play?  Sure.  Okay.  What does Anthony need concert tickets to?  Britney Spears.  Shut up.  Wow, there's a huge wow banner on Channel 7.  Holy cow, who was that?  I don't know.  That was the guy we hung up on because freaking Spaz didn't have his name right.  Son of a bitch, the wow flag was huge.  All right.  I think they rocked.  They're going to probably go back to the live shot.  You think they're going to go to the live shot?  Channel 7?  Whew.  Very, very good, whoever you are. 
[02:36:00]  Call the radio show.  A huge wow banner behind the reporter, Anthony.  I understand.  Lovely.  The story's over, Eddie.  Another psychopath has struck.  Channel 7 today.  Nice.  Every day, someone's striking.  All right, and no, it's not Britney Spears, believe it or not.  Anthony does not want tickets for Britney Spears.  Okay, thanks.  All right, man.  Later.  Let's go to George.  George, what does Anthony need tickets to?  That fag wants to see NSYNC.  Get out of here.  I'm going to win. 
[02:36:30]  Let me go on the ski trip.  You'll see.  You'll get nothing.  It's got to be one of the shows we named.  No doubt.  Is that your answer?  Yeah.  Is that your final answer?  That is my final answer.  Yeah, you bet.  Yeah, you bet.  What do I get?  Let me go on the ski trip.  Shut up.  Come on.  I'm just a thrill. 
[02:37:00]  Nothing's sacred.  Come on, Anthony.  They have, like, two good songs.  Nothing's sacred.  Are you going to get to get in the pit and mosh to this song, Anthony?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh! 
[02:37:30]  That part, you can have your lighter out.  Very good.  Very funny.  Go ahead.  You really don't want tickets to see Cornyn?  Come on.  Go to Typo Negative and Cold Chamber and hang out with a bunch of, you know, 20-year-old guys.  I'll go to No Doubt and be surrounded by chicks.  Typo Negative.  Good choice.  I'm getting a pair of tickets, Opie.  Does that make sense to you now?  Hey, I understand why you're getting along.  All right, guys.  I'm out of here.  Ant, you really let me down. 
[02:38:00]  All right.  Hold on.  We've got to give you a prize for playing what concert tickets does Anthony need.  What do you want?  We have a ton of stuff to do.  I want to go on the ski trip, man.  All right.  Where's the ski trip folder?  Oh, we're done with that.  We gave away all those spots already.  You could have wrestling tickets or the new album from Smashing Pumpkins.  Wrestling tickets.  Wrestling tickets?  Yeah.  All right.  Hold on the line, man.  Cool.  George's line sacred around here.  George wins a pair of tickets to the WWF Saturday, April 15th at Madison Square Garden  before you can buy them, plus the WWF T-shirt. 
[02:38:30]  Tickets go on sale this Sunday at 10 a.m. through Ticketmaster.  Yes, Ben?  I think he's an actual fan because remember the night going to Rick's pastor party that  no doubt CD was in his truck?  All right, Ben.  You're really funny.  You're all a bunch of bulls.  I understand.  Look, look, look, look.  Look, before you give your explanation, we also have to mention that we did find an  InXS CD in your car and a Alanis Morissette?  Alanis Morissette. 
[02:39:00]  See, when I used to drive in to work with Ann, we were rocking to, like, Zombie.  Rob Zombie.  Come on.  I'm still rocking.  Well, I don't get to commute with him anymore.  He's rocking it, no doubt.  You are the worst.  You are the worst, man.  No, no.  Come on.  It's been a while since we've gotten something on you, Anthony.  No, no.  You see, you don't seem to understand that there's...  Look, look. 
[02:39:30]  Let's not forget the time you called me to talk stops and I heard this song in the background.  No!  You will admit that that was playing in the background.  Look.  Look, I was...  I had the goddamn radio and I'm scanning around and finally you picked up the phone and that's  where the radio was stopped.  Yeah.  And I started talking to you.  It was.  Oh, man.  There's no explaining it.  I'm sunk.  I wasn't... 
[02:40:00]  Shut up.  I wasn't listening to this.  Oh, man.  I can understand if it was like bye-bye love by the cars or something.  That almost rocks.  Oh, man.  No, I wasn't listening to it.  It just came on.  This happened to come on the radio.  Yeah, it was on scan.  And it stopped on cue and you picked the phone up.  What am I going to do?  Hold on up.  I got to get a cool song on the radio so you don't think I'm a tool?  You know?  Well, if you knew the show, yes.  Yeah, I know. 
[02:40:30]  In hindsight, I guess I should have.  You see what I've been doing now, though?  Whenever I call from the road, I try to find a faggiest song to put on the radio.  When I call you, I make sure I have my Anal C CD.  Anal C.  Can't say the real name of the band.  Hey, Ann.  Just hanging out with this hardcore band.  What's up?  Just wanted to check in with you to see what we're doing on the show today.  Look. 
[02:41:00]  You want to dig up crap like this.  What?  You want to dig it up.  Who had to get an autographed Ricky Martin CD?  Oh, my God.  Come on.  Come on.  Who had to get it?  Was that Anthony?  No.  I think that was open.  Oh, my God.  You know it was for Sandy.  Okay.  I'll buy that.  Okay.  All right.  That's fair enough, right?  Fair enough. 
[02:41:30]  Okay.  Sure.  Very good.  Okay.  Are we understanding each other?  Sort of.  Well, I'm still in litigation.  Oh, my God.  So it's someone else's CD collection that happens to be in your car.  What's his name?  Jerk off, man.  You are the worst. 
[02:42:00]  All right.  You're.  You're.  We were just having fun.  Now, this is Nami S-Y.  Wait.  Vito's checking in.  Vito?  Yo.  What's up, Vito?  How you doing, guys?  Hey, Anthony.  I need my warranty CD back.  You guys suck.  Syndication now.  All right, man.  Bye.  Bye, Bob.  Oh, man.  I got to just take one of these calls.  It wouldn't be fair if I didn't call it.  Fred, what's up?  Oh, it's just a girl.  Hey.  Girl. 
[02:42:30]  Hey.  Come on.  I knew it.  Oh.  Ben just can't keep a secret.  Hey, guys.  Yeah, what's up, Matt?  I got those Yanni tickets you wanted there.  Easy.  Smart.  I actually went to see Yanni at the beach.  Oh.  Okay.  And we're going to be honest here today.  What happened there?  Oh, you're so hot, Anthony.  My ass.  Yeah, Yanni.  I feel like I've got a little culture in my life. 
[02:43:00]  A culture?  No, that's a few years back.  Yanni.  What was the worst show you ever saw?  Ooh.  Ooh, that's...  Let me see.  I saw REO Speedwagon.  Jackson Brown.  Oh.  I had to see Jackson Brown.  That was pretty bad.  Yeah.  Look at Spaz.  Spaz just ran out of here.  He almost knocked Matt over.  All right.  Let's go to Rob.  Rob, you're next on N.E.W.  What's up? 
[02:43:30]  Hey, what's up, Opie?  I called you guys yesterday.  Yeah.  Hey, Opie, did you have to go jet skiing with Ricky Martin to get the CD set?  All right.  Easy.  We just asked to find people at Sony to help me out for a Christmas present.  Yeah, yeah.  That's the truth, man.  Yeah, you're not off the hook either.  Going to see No Doubt.  You can wear some suspenders and checkered pants.  It's going to dye his hair.  He's going to put a little purple in it.  Oh, come on.  I'm just going because Gavin might be there. 
[02:44:00]  Come on, man.  All right, Rob.  Disappointing me, guys.  Oh, come on.  All right.  Let's go.  Disappointing.  Let's go to Chris.  He's one of the Psycho March psychopaths.  He was just on Channel 7 with a huge wow sign.  Chris, was that you?  What's up, boys?  Was that really you or you just...  That was me, dude.  I swear to God.  This guy just got back from the car.  That was a huge wow sign, man.  They were chasing me.  Did you see my buddy on the other side?  Yeah.  Yeah, they were frigging cops.  They must have been talking to the show because I had the walk went on and it said you heard me.  He's going to chase us to the car, bro.  You guys are out, man. 
[02:44:30]  Oh, my God.  It sounds like you're out of breath.  Oh, forget about it.  My phones are breaking up.  I don't want to lose you guys.  Well, we saw it, man.  Thank you very much.  Psycho Mark, it's for you, brother.  Yeah, Psycho Mark is bowing to you right now, man.  Great job.  One of the many disciples.  That was a huge wow sign.  You might want to make the wow sign a little smaller so we can read it.  I think we had like a W and a half an O.  We got about tapes, so...  We're going to review all of the tapes from all of these wowings on all the live shots  and hand out Psycho Mark's psychopath medals. 
[02:45:00]  Yes.  We got it.  We got to honor these people as they should be.  Chris, come by tomorrow.  We'll give you a bunch of stuff for doing that.  Let's call some wrestling tickets.  You want to...  Yeah.  If you just did that, it sounds like it was you.  Yeah.  Hold on.  We'll give you some wrestling tickets.  Thanks, boss.  We got to reward the psychopaths.  Thanks, boss.  Yes.  All right.  Hold on, Chris.  Thanks, buddy.  And very good job.  Thanks, buddy.  And to you guys.  All right, cool.  We're still waiting for the first girl to wow the live TV cameras.  An actual wow would be the next step at this point, right?  Are you getting pounding on the instant feedback yet?  Rob from Long Island. 
[02:45:30]  Hey, Ant, maybe Lilith Fair will hit town soon.  You better get your Backstreet Boy tickets before all your homo friends get them first.  Anthony, are you looking forward to the Mike and the Mechanics reunion?  It just sucks when you say something on the show.  I guess it's Ant's turn in the barrel today.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You couldn't take Ben to the side and say, hey, Ben, you know, don't tell me what, but  I really need, you know, no doubt tickets. 
[02:46:00]  Ant, I'm just going to call.  Your Barry Manilow tickets are cool.  Shut up, Barry Manilow.  Jerry, what's going on?  I hear Amba might be getting back together.  People have pounded me, you bastard.  Hey, Jerry, what's up?  Hey, how are you guys?  Good.  There were two wow signs on Channel 7.  Really?  There was one in the back.  There was like a black sign with white writing on it.  Yeah.  And there was another one in the front.  Oh, nice.  It was like white with black writing on it.  There was three? 
[02:46:30]  Psycho Mark's saying there was three.  There was an orange one as well.  There was three of them together.  There were three?  And the sign that said Anthony on it.  It said there are three huge wow signs in the background.  Do we really have a tape for that?  The biggest must have been about 15 feet wide.  Cool, Jerry.  Thank you.  Hey, you hang in there, guys.  We love you.  We're trying.  Later.  Having a little rough one today, but we're trying to get through it.  Kevin, what's up?  You're next on NDW.  O&A.  Yes.  I'm the guy that had the big white wow sign in the front.  Huh?  You just gave him a tape? 
[02:47:00]  No, we gave that to Chris.  That's the big black one.  I had the big white one.  All right.  Hold on.  I have a sign right here.  All right.  I have a tape, and I know what happened to the girl.  What happened to the girl?  They told us that they were going to let us know when they were going to go up.  Yeah.  And then they didn't do it, and he was, like, really quiet, but before he went up, he turned  to us, and he said, now, don't do anything crazy or wacky, because we're here for your  school.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  And so he said, I'll let you know when we're going to go up, and the camera guy just kind  of, he just checked the shot, and then he just walked away from the camera. 
[02:47:30]  So we didn't know that they were going up, so the next thing we know, we're, like, putting  our wow signs up, and it's like, we didn't know if it was on or over or what, and the  girl's standing, like, right, like, 10 feet from me, and, like, they turned the lights  down, and she goes, what happened?  I was all ready.  She had her bra off and everything.  She almost got to wow live TV?  Damn it.  She had nice cans.  Oh, really?  Yeah, she did.  All right.  Kevin, hold on the line.  I believe you.  All right.  I have a sign.  We'd appreciate it if you guys didn't lie to us.  I want to give you some wrestling tickets, man. 
[02:48:00]  Okay, cool.  Kevin, another Psycho Mark psychopath.  Hold on the line.  Thanks.  All right, there he goes.  Also, still looking for a lesbian for Karen, who we did not forget about you, Karen.  She's there in the corner waiting for a lesbian to show up so we could get the lesbian couch  in here and get a little workout going on for Karen, who's very nice, right, Ant?  Yes.  Very nice, firm hooters.  She's got a C and a D.  I'm getting severely pounded on this. 
[02:48:30]  What else are they saying on the instant feedback?  Oh, God.  I'm with the fag police.  I want a warrant for Anthony's apartment to search for Liza Minnelli CDs.  I'm just glad it's not my turn today.  I don't think I could handle it today.  Hey, Ant, you going to the No Doubt show with Gay Marco?  You know, Gay Marco hasn't called us in a while.  No Doubt, Anthony's a fag. 
[02:49:00]  Suck, man.  All right, you got a cue down, Mark?  What, the tape?  Yeah, cue up the tape.  Oh, you want the tape?  No, I want to check it out.  I want to see it.  All right, yeah.  What is Nick Carter calling for?  No, it's, uh, I don't think it's that Nick Carter.  Oh.  I think it's, uh, a different Nick Carter.  Oh, I thought it was our buddy in, uh, Boston.  No, it's, uh...  Oh, all right.  Uh, Nick.  Hello.  Yeah.  I'd like to invite Anthony down to my special show.  I'm from the Backstreet Boys, and I'd like to show them what I've got playing in my pants.  Okay.  I want you sideways. 
[02:49:30]  Okay.  Very, very funny.  Very funny.  That's hysterical.  That was great.  All right, Ed, time's up.  Very good.  You handled yourself quite well there.  Thank you.  I made the mistake of actually trying to explain myself the first couple of minutes.  Oh, yeah.  I realized I was completely insane.  You never explain anything on the show.  You just take it.  Yep.  Going to No Doubt.  All right.  Okay.  That's it. 
[02:50:00]  Okay, then.  Okay.  Okay, good.  Uh-huh.  I'm going to be looking forward to hearing this, uh, this song.  Sure.  This big rhythm of my eyes, I'm exposed, and it's no big surprise.  Don't you think I know exactly where I stand?  This world is forcing me to hold your hand.  Everybody!  I'm the girl of the little hungry.  We deliver keggers. 
[02:50:30]  We deliver keggers.  Vanessa, what's going on?  Hey, how are you doing?  How are you doing?  How are you doing?  Anthony, I like No Doubt, but, you know, I'll get you a George Foreman grill if you go  and see Barbara Streisand with me.  Barbara Streisand.  Get out of here.  What are you, insane?  Barbara Streisand.  All righty.  George Foreman grill.  Thank you.  I got the reference.  Thank you, Vanessa.  Bye.  All right, bye.  All right, Anthony, let's take a quick break, and we'll be back, okay? 
[02:51:00]  Please.  All right.  I can't even believe these morons.  He's a disgusting little man.  What a douchebag.  What a douchebag.  Trainwreck radio.  Game over.  This is sicker than faces of death.  All right, we checked it out.  There was a wow on Channel 7.  There were three of them.  Three of them.  And a girl that almost flashed.  Yeah.  Almost.  You could tell she was.  Got a little scared.  You could tell she got a little nervous and didn't do it. 
[02:51:30]  You've got to be quick if you're going to try to do that on live TV.  Those are huge wow signs.  What was that one?  I saw my name on one of them.  It was four signs.  It said Anthony something that we couldn't read.  Good job, though.  The psychopaths out in full force once again today.  All over the ball field.  We were all over Raw last night at the Garden.  Yeah.  Got to thank the WWF for treating us very nice yesterday.  So many signs.  And we announced early in the show that the feud with the WWF is officially over. 
[02:52:00]  Yeah.  They made good.  And they're making good for our listeners as well.  Giving us a ton of tickets to give away to their future events and all that.  And maybe other things in the near future.  All right.  Let's go back to the phone.  Susan, you're next on WWF.  Susan.  How are you doing?  I'm calling to defend Anthony on getting a no-doubt ticket.  I think it's a very sweet thing that he's doing. 
[02:52:30]  I thought we were done with it.  So did I.  Well, you had all of those opposing views.  Oh, okay.  The only view that, you know, I thought I'd call in and defend you.  Thank you, Susan.  You want to defend Anthony because you, too, like no-doubt.  No, I don't like no-doubt, but I think it was nice that he would try to get tickets for something that hopefully he's not really interested in,  but he's getting them for friends.  Susan, what do you like?  Corn?  Kid Rock?  Maybe some tool?  No, I don't like all that heavy stuff. 
[02:53:00]  What do you like?  Well, I kind of like jazz, and I like some classic rock.  Classic rock?  Like what?  Like Crosby Stills, Nash & Young.  Yeah, Crosby Stills, Nash & Young.  Yeah, so you didn't get tickets for that, Anthony.  Okay.  Now, how's your taste?  Sorry.  All right.  Well, Susan, you did a great job.  Thank you for standing up for me, Susan.  So, Anthony, are you going to give me some wrestling tickets for defending you? 
[02:53:30]  You'll get nothing unlike it.  That's right.  Oh, okay.  Thanks.  We're only giving them out to the people wowing live TV today.  All right.  All right.  Let's go.  Thank you, Susan.  Bye.  Let's go to Laura.  Laura, what's going on?  So, there's chicks in typo negative concerts.  I think so.  Right?  And they're dressed in all in black, and they've got the vampire thing going on, and, you know,  they're happening.  That's a great book.  You could get some action there.  I bet you'd get wowed there.  I'd rather have the Gwen lookalikes than the goth chicks. 
[02:54:00]  They're a little frightening.  And not into the goth chicks.  Oh, but come on.  You don't really.  I mean, I am a brand new listener.  The guy in my work listens to you every day.  Finally, I started listening yesterday.  I said, these guys are cool.  And then I find out this, Ricky Martin, in no doubt.  Ricky Martin.  Now, don't throw me in there.  I'm not just trying to figure out your format.  Like I said yesterday, I told you something about the wheel well.  The guy was hiding in the wheel well, and I thought it was hysterical.  And I said, all right, these guys have it going on.  Did I hear this?  Now, what were you listening to before us? 
[02:54:30]  Oh, you know, just whatever was on.  And the guy Warren Beatport, my work, he listens to you every day.  And I started hearing this.  And, you know, he's laughing and laughing.  And I said, I've got to listen to these guys.  Oh, cool.  You know, I did listen to Stern.  But then I heard today that that's supposed to be like a taboo thing.  I'm not allowed to say that.  No, that's not true.  That's totally not true.  It's the listeners that are making up all that crap.  Oh, it is.  Well, you know, like I said, I'm brand new.  You know, brand new for me. 
[02:55:00]  We support Stern and his endeavors.  We were trying to support it.  Oh, never mind.  Yeah, I heard the person next to me told me that you're not allowed to talk about it,  which I completely understand.  But so you guys were really.  We just thought we'd show some support today.  Yeah.  It blew up my face today.  Oh, I see.  I see what's going on.  I got you now.  All right, Laura.  Thank you.  All right, listen.  I'm going to keep listening to you guys.  So you can convince us to whip it on Wednesday, huh?  Hell yeah.  It's all over the country now.  Yeah, well, you know, I see the wow everywhere. 
[02:55:30]  It's on video games.  It's on the Dreamcast, what, Crazy Taxi or whatever.  Yeah, on the back of all the trucks.  Yeah.  Well, anybody that could come up with that format has got to be okay.  So I guess I could overlook the Ricky Martin and the no doubt for that.  All right.  All right.  Thanks a lot, guys.  You're great.  In time, you'll find out that we're actually pretty cool.  All right.  Well, listen, it's been two days.  I'm just sounding a little faggy today, but.  Well, it's been two days, and so far I think you guys are excellent.  So I'm looking forward to listening to you for a real long time.  So keep on the air.  Laura, we should put some of the people that have been with us for the last two years. 
[02:56:00]  Uh-huh.  Today's not one of our better shows.  Yeah.  We're pulling this show out of our butts.  Well, you know what?  It still sounds great, though.  Well, thank you.  I mean, it still sounds great.  All right.  All right.  Thanks a lot.  Okay.  Bye.  Bye-bye.  Let's go to Frank.  Moving on to other things, of course, today, Anthony.  Frank, what's going on?  If my chippy wants to see that, I'm going.  Frankie.  Yes.  Yes.  Does Rick still have his Camaro?  I don't know.  Because I heard Loverboy's encountering, you know, Rick and Anthony carpool to Loverboy. 
[02:56:30]  Well, first of all, Rick's driving the Miata, the yellow gay Miata from Go.  From Go.  From Go.  Remember that car, Jay Moore?  That's right.  That's the name Scott Wolf was in?  Right.  So you guys could carpool together at Loverboy, huh?  Well, actually, you know what?  We could make it a threesome, because Opie's got the Cabrio with the backseat.  I love how Rick tried to defend himself.  Trust me.  I know the Cabrio's gay, and I'm trading in my Cabrio. 
[02:57:00]  You actually like your Miata.  I do.  And I'm not trading in the Cabrio.  It's someone else's car, and I'm getting my own car again soon.  Getting your own Cabrio?  Yeah.  Oh.  Yeah, Rick, obviously.  Oh, my God.  Okay, diamond dust.  No, no, Rick, you went out of your way to buy a yellow Miata.  No, I was presented.  That's a lot different.  I was presented with a great deal on a car that was a car that was rarely made.  That's a lot different than leasing an S10 Blazer for the last three years.  The lease was up. 
[02:57:30]  Didn't know what I wanted next.  So I traded it in.  I don't have a car now.  Got to get around town, so I'm driving the chick's Cabrio.  That's okay.  You said it next door.  That's the exact store.  I gave it up when my lease was up.  Big deal.  You gave it up.  So was the deal.  Then I went to my Toyota pickup.  Gave that up, too.  And you gave it all up for the freaking Miata.  Yeah.  Which you drive around town.  Which is a collector's item because they only made a certain number of those colors.  Why yellow?  What does a certain number of those colors mean?  What does it mean? 
[02:58:00]  That's why yellow.  Are you going to cash in eventually?  Make a fortune off your yellow Miata?  I could probably make five grand.  Five grand to drive around like a fag?  Look, Mr. Bon Bon.  You know, it's my little car.  You don't like it, Tom.  You love your little car, but you don't have a lot of...  I picked up my hot chick wife with that thing.  You don't have a lot of ammunition, though.  Yeah, I do.  We've discussed my cabrio dilemma.  I'm not happy about it. 
[02:58:30]  I drive it on weekends, tops, maybe five miles a week.  And I'm not proud of it.  To and from the glory hole.  Shut up, you ass.  Go on.  Okay, let's go to line eight, then.  Oh, come on.  I'm kidding, man.  Jimmy, what's going on?  Jimmy!  How are you, Jimmy?  Good, buddy.  Hey, I got something for both of you.  First off, Anthony, I got those Night Ranger tickets you wanted.  Also, Opie, John Tesh was sold out, so I'm going to get that for you.  You ass.  You guys rule, man. 
[02:59:00]  I'll talk to you soon.  Thank you, Jimmy.  Later.  Can we get another girl in here for Karen who's just pacing around outside?  Huh?  There's one on the way.  We have a girl on the way?  On the way.  She jumped on the N train.  The N train.  Where's she coming from?  Downtown?  Queens.  She'll be here in about 15, 20 minutes.  She left about 10, 15 minutes ago.  Is she hot?  I have no idea.  It doesn't matter if she smells, because Karen can't smell.  Right.  I'm getting roasted. 
[02:59:30]  What do you mean?  On the instant feedback?  Yeah.  Come on, share.  No doubt, Anthony's a guzzling balloon knot licker.  All right.  Hey, Anthony, don't speak, you tool.  Don't worry, Anthony.  My girlfriend turns me into a homo, too.  No, that's not the case.  Oh, my God.  I heard that Peter, Paul, and Mary are going to be at MSG in the summer. 
[03:00:00]  I'll see you there.  You're a fag.  It's from Mike from Jersey.  You're getting pounded, dude.  Pounded.  See, this guy, Anthony, I've seen no doubt three times.  I don't go for the music, but the girls in the little tight belly shirts.  Okay.  We're 12.  Shut up, Rick.  Opie has a Volkswagen.  That's good, Ben.  Ben from Garfield gets the credit for that. 
[03:00:30]  Does Rick have Sammy Sosa's number on the back windshield of his Miata?  Boy, we're getting pounded.  Between Ant with the cars and no doubt, Opie with Ricky Martin, Rick with lover boy, and  spazzed with man breath on his unit, you ought to be broadcasting from a San Francisco bath  house.  Come on.  We did a good job getting all the gayness off this radio show.  Yeah.  Let's continue down this path. 
[03:01:00]  All right.  So, I guess we got, wait, another girl wants to defend you.  Joanne, what's up?  Hi.  How you doing?  Great.  Hey.  I have to defend Anthony.  Thank you.  I think deep down, everybody, no matter who they are, likes somebody that's a little odd  to everyone else.  Mm-hmm.  Deep down, you guys, like, Opie, you've got to like somebody.  I mean, Ricky Martin, come on.  Hmm.  You teeny bopper.  Let me think.  The faggiest thing I've listened to recently. 
[03:01:30]  What?  I'm thinking of the faggiest thing I've listened to recently.  Okay.  So, you're forgiven.  No, I'm thinking.  The latest Beck CD.  Checked out the new Smashing Pumpkins.  All right, I guess.  Everybody likes somebody.  A little tough.  No, I haven't listened to anything really great lately.  You know what?  He's being a man for admitting it.  Oh, great.  That's what it is.  Thank you.  All right, Joanne.  I've got to ask you a favor.  Yes.  My niece's ninth birthday is coming up, and she loves WWF. 
[03:02:00]  Is it possible?  I would never ask if you guys look.  Does she want to go to No Doubt?  She loves these guys.  She loves China, that manly-looking one.  You know, I've got to tell you something about China.  We were in the fourth row last night.  She's a lot.  Really?  Really?  She's a lot hotter in person.  You know, she didn't look bad last night.  I mean, she's still...  I have to give her that much credit.  She didn't look bad, but some of the pictures of her out there...  She's still manly.  Let's not, you know, but I mean, she doesn't... 
[03:02:30]  She's a grand girl.  She doesn't look as...  She's a grand bet.  She doesn't look as manly in person as...  I know I'm going to catch hell for saying this, but...  I heard she looks like she weighs a lot less in person.  Yeah, yeah.  She's got a tiny little waist, huge, huge boos, but then...  Well, they're fake.  I know, but then the arms, though, are just...  She's just got man arms, man chin.  Yeah, that she does.  But everything else on her is like, wow.  So...  Yeah, but would you want her?  Come on.  Huh?  Would you hit on her? 
[03:03:00]  Would I go there?  Yeah.  I'm a guy, yeah.  Oh, come on.  What?  She kept your butt.  Huh?  Could you imagine?  She kept your butt.  It's okay.  That's okay.  A little roughhousing never hurt anyone.  Okay.  You're sure we want a roughhousing?  No, we'd go there.  I mean, come on.  If it takes her this much to a good, can you imagine what you'd be waking up to next morning?  Well, there you go.  All right, Joanne.  Do we have any wrestling tickets?  Spaz?  Spazzy? 
[03:03:30]  Do we have any wrestling tickets?  Give away our fill for today if you want to give away another pair of some T's.  Yeah, give them to Joanne.  She sounds cool.  Joanne, hold on the line, all right?  Thank you.  All right.  We'll talk to you soon.  You guys are great.  I listen to you guys all the time.  You and the radio chick.  I love you guys.  Yeah, please support the radio chick.  Oh, I do.  All right.  I'd love to be her sidekick.  Let me tell you.  I think they might be making an announcement about that very soon.  Yeah?  Yeah, so thank you, Joanne.  No problem.  Have a good night, guys.  And check out the show on After Us tonight. 
[03:04:00]  Okay.  There's no more Tom Likas.  Okay.  We're going to try out.  You guys are the best, though.  All right.  Well, thank you, Joanne.  Thank you.  We're going to be trying out another radio show tonight at 7 o'clock.  Yes.  And we're going to give them a chance to shine before we criticize.  That's it.  Got to give all the new shows a chance before we criticize.  Gee, I wonder what happened to Tom.  Just didn't work out, Ant.  Didn't catch on, I guess.  Kind of sad.  In New York.  All we were asking for was a little respect, and he didn't want to give it to us. 
[03:04:30]  So, we're still here in New York.  He's not.  Yeah, he said about two weeks ago that he wasn't going anywhere.  Or three weeks ago, he wasn't going anywhere.  Mm-hmm.  This show was here to stay in New York, so.  Mm-hmm.  Oh, well.  Well, look at that.  How does that happen?  As happens.  Mm.  Oh, well.  But check out the new show tonight at 7, okay?  Right.  All right, Ant.  Let's take a quick break.  Hopefully, this girl will come down here so we can finish this radio show in style today.  Yeah, please.  Jesus. 
[03:05:00]  We got some girl on the N train somewhere.  Oy.  What a mess this has been today.  It's 1027-WNEW.  I'll be an Anthony.  In my day, radio was boring all the time, and we liked it that way.  And tell that dirty Sanchez guy to take a bath.  A mess.  1027-WNEW.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Okay.  Line two is good, you see?  Let's go to line two.  Hi, who's this? 
[03:05:30]  Hi, it's Taylor.  Hi, Taylor.  How are you?  I'm fine, and you?  Real good.  How are you guys?  I just wanted to...  First of all, is Karen still there?  Yeah, Karen's still here.  Yeah, hi.  Hi, Karen.  I wish I could be there because just as I was pulling away, I had heard that she's looking  for a girl, and about 5 o'clock tonight, I had my first lesbian experience.  Good for you.  Absolutely incredible.  We agreed to meet, but we couldn't, you know, have too much time together. 
[03:06:00]  So Thursday morning, we're planning to meet at a motel, and we're just going to be together  all day.  All right, hold on.  First of all, what do you look like, Taylor?  What do I look like?  Let's see.  I'm about 5'6".  I know you guys judge by the size of the breasts.  No, not really.  They come in all sizes and shapes.  But I'm on a 38D.  Whoa, hello.  That's the size of the breasts I have.  I'm medium build.  I have short brown hair.  Very bubbly personality.  Very bubbly.  Yeah?  Yes.  Very bubbly. 
[03:06:30]  I'm married.  Uh-huh.  And my husband's totally loving the fact that I was with, you know, going to be with a woman.  All right, so how'd you get together with this girl today?  We just had met, like, through mutual friends, and it was just that, I don't know, this conversation  came up about being bi-curious, and I had said, I'm very bi-curious.  I've been for a long time.  And she's like, so have I.  And then I found out she's only 19.  And how old are you?  I'm going to be 28.  Nice.  So I was like, I'd love to meet you, and, you know, maybe... 
[03:07:00]  Well, maybe that could be arranged.  Maybe something could happen.  And she was like, sure, and then I had heard that Karen was looking for somebody, and all  women out there, if you're curious, go ahead and do it, because it's amazing.  So where did this take place today?  It took place...  I'm in Jersey.  It took place, actually, we met at a restaurant, and we were just having coffee, and then it  was in the parking lot in the car.  You just went to town?  We made out for, like, 15 minutes.  Did you pet any portal?  A little bit.  We couldn't do too much, but we were touching breasts, and, oh, it was amazing. 
[03:07:30]  How big was she?  She was about 36.  36 days, she said she was.  Yeah?  She was cute?  Very, very cute.  Adorable.  Were you guys bumping donuts in the car?  I don't think, Jay Moore.  That's the best way to describe it.  I'm just telling you...  Well, were you bumping donuts?  Um, no.  No.  We didn't have...  I mean, it was kind of confined.  We're out in the open, you know, we're in the car, but... 
[03:08:00]  You were a little nervous that you were going to get caught, right?  Yes, exactly.  Yes.  We kept looking.  You know, some of the, uh, you know, the foreign dishwashers were coming out and smoking  a cigarette, and we keep looking and turning around, but it was...  Somebody has to go see Karen, because it's amazing.  I can't even tell you how great it is.  Well, we have some girl on the, uh, the N train, was it?  Coming from Queens?  Yeah.  So, hopefully, they'll get here in time today, but, uh, wow, that's a great little story.  You're a bubbly little girl there.  Yeah, it was incredible, and I can't wait to do it. 
[03:08:30]  You want to be a lesbian for a day in our studio?  I would do it.  I, I would, I was just telling Rick that I would do it.  It's just, you know, I, I didn't, I wasn't too sure, like...  Anything was I, trust me.  You know, meet, meet somebody, you know, and do it like I wanted to get to know the person,  but then I'm, I'm thinking, it was incredible, absolutely amazing.  I can't even believe how good it was.  Yeah, it's a very comfortable atmosphere when you come in to be lesbian for a day.  We got a couch, we turned down the lights, we, we put some nice music on for you. 
[03:09:00]  Yeah, I've seen some of the pictures on the website.  Very interesting.  And then, like, 50 guys just check you out.  Well, that's great.  I, I'd let anybody watch.  That, that is cool.  So, so you had a little fun in the, the restaurant park a lot, and now you're going to spend the  whole day in a hotel with her, what, Thursday?  Yes, in the morning.  Before work?  I'm, actually, that day I'm off.  Nice.  So, I can't wait.  Have you guys been discussing what you want to do in the hotel room?  Oh, yes.  All the time.  Because we talk on the computer.  Uh-huh.  And, oh, intense. 
[03:09:30]  What do you want to happen to you?  Everything.  Whatever she wants.  Anything and everything.  Toys, games, whatever.  Oh, you're open to it all, huh?  Chutes and ladders.  Yes.  I'm open to it all.  I'll bring the chutes and ladders.  We'll play Candyland.  Or Uncle Wiggly.  It's a total, it's a total fantasy.  I got my Uncle Wiggly in my pants.  I just want it to come true.  And, you know, of course, it's going to happen.  I can't wait.  That's great.  Her tongue was so soft. 
[03:10:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Amazing.  The funny thing about tongues.  Was she, you know, exploring your boobs?  Yes.  And you enjoyed that?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Very much.  Much better than a guy going at it with you?  No, I mean, you know, my husband's an excellent lover.  It's just being with a woman, reaching that level is just, you can't even imagine what it  feels like.  It's intense.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Incredible.  So, I wish Karen the best of luck.  Go out there, ladies, and go find Karen, because it's great. 
[03:10:30]  Well, Karen called last minute.  I mean, if it doesn't happen today, we'll, uh...  We'll arrange something.  We'll get someone else.  Well, good luck.  Love you guys.  You guys are great.  Well, thank you, Tara.  Thank you.  You're welcome.  All right, bye.  Bye.  Let's move on to Sarah.  A lot of women checking in today.  Sarah, what's up?  Hey, guys.  I have a big dilemma.  Okay.  I don't know whether or not I give my boyfriend a Hummer the right way.  Uh-oh.  The right way.  I mean, I'm pretty sure I'm doing everything right, and when I ask him, he says I'm doing  everything right, but...  How do you spell X? 
[03:11:00]  Act, A-C-T.  No, no, no.  When you question somebody.  Ask.  Yes.  A-S-K.  Oh.  Then how come you said it like that?  Ask.  Because I'm Hispanic.  Oh.  Oh, yes.  Oh, I thought you were Irish.  Oh.  So, now you don't know if you're giving Hummers properly?  I mean, I know I'm doing it right, okay?  And I vary a lot.  I'm doing it, and doing it, and doing it, whale.  Doing it, and doing it. 
[03:11:30]  And, but the thing is, I don't get, like, a big reaction out of him.  Only once have I gotten this, uh, kind of reaction from him.  All right.  You've got to play porn star.  you gotta give the look up  what are you doing  I toss the hair  I look up  I make sure he's seeing me doing it  yeah that's very key  you gotta get that eye contact going  and then if I'm doing it from the side  and he's looking down  I make sure I put my hair the other way  so he can see the action  you're not using teeth are you? 
[03:12:00]  no no way  you're making the Charles Bronson face right?  no  for the older audience  are you doing  wait wait wait  why aren't you making the Charles Bronson face?  what's the Charles Bronson face?  where you pull your lips and over your cheek  oh  okay  Charles Bronson  like Charles Bronson  I must dig a tunnel  well I make sure  I use motion lotion 
[03:12:30]  everything  yeah  and only once have I gotten this  oh kind of reaction from him  do you complete  alright hold on  she completes  I was going to be talking about anything  yeah  well her lunch  do you  no no  okay  she completes  everything  everything  and uh  wow  and there's no huge reaction huh?  no  and it's very disappointing to me  because he said he enjoys it a lot  he always loves to get one  are you working it all over the whole thing? 
[03:13:00]  everything  the you know  yeah yeah  top to bottom  everything  everything  varying speeds  licking  everything  I even had  twig and  twig and berries  everything  and you have a  you have a tongue piercing?  yeah  and he's not into this?  yeah that might be it  he said he loves it  and he  every time we see each other  he's like oh you know  whatever  you know to do it  and I do it  you know is there any guy  reaction from him  is there any guy that like 
[03:13:30]  is into the tongue piercing  for oral  you want a metal  thing slapping around on it?  no cause you  or all tongue?  underneath  yeah  it's very useful  when you use it underneath  I take it out sometimes  what's good with the metal  ball?  or something?  the way it's like  you know under the  okay we can figure it out  I don't know  now they'll just be all  beef  all tongue  maybe he's just not  into the hummers  but he asks for it  every single time 
[03:14:00]  hmm  I just want to know  I don't know  it sounds like you're  giving him a perfect  hummer  maybe he's just  enjoying himself  and he's laying back  maybe he's too shy  to express himself  maybe he's gay  maybe he's doing  your sister  no he's not  oh okay  how long have you  been with him?  um  it'll be 7 years  next month  yeah  on the 18th  maybe he's getting  a little bored  wait how old are you?  me?  I'm 20  oh  you guys started 
[03:14:30]  when you were 13?  yeah we started  when we were like  in junior high  when did you start  hobbing the knob?  uh  when I was  16  16  when did you  give up the  balloon nut?  never  ah  still uncharted  he wants to do that  but I'm scared  yeah  just drink a lot  of wine  get really drunk  just get really  plastered  get snotted  honey  I'm ready  my balloon nut's
