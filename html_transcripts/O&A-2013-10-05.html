<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, showcasing its characteristically chaotic and often offensive style.  The show opened with Sam Roberts hosting “Worst of the Week,” heavily featuring Fez Whatley's outrage over a Chevrolet commercial's use of "crazy" and "insane."  This sparked a lengthy debate about the shifting landscape of acceptable language, peppered with racial slurs, homophobic slurs, and other derogatory terms. Fez's past actions, including his Hitler costume appearance on the show, were contrasted with his current sensitivity, fueling the discussion.  The segment also touched upon a perceived conflict between Fez and Sam Roberts, stemming from a prior incident involving Troy Kwan.  Studio guests during this portion included Meghan McCain, Paul Williams, Nick DiPaolo, and Dennis Falcone.  Clips of Fez's reaction were played.

Next, the show tackled radio DJ J.J. Walker (Spider Harrison), criticizing his excessively loud voice and perceived lack of comedic talent, using audio clips as evidence.  The hosts contrasted Walker's remote, easy job with their own in-studio demands.  A phone call with comedian Colin Quinn followed, where he critiqued their overly polite interview style, contrasting it with their usual antagonistic approach. He referenced past experiences with the show and its awkwardness with more serious guests like Mark Cuban and Paul Anka.  This segment also included listener requests for J.J. Walker clips, a discussion about music radio channel information, a mention of a previous guest using a racial slur,  anecdotes about Bobo (a recurring character who nearly drowned in Anthony's pool), and a “Jocktober” segment mocking Scott and Todd, featuring clips of their song parodies and highlighting their perceived lack of chemistry.  Studio guests for this portion included Flo Rader, Paul Williams, Meghan McCain, and Dan Soder; Colin Quinn called in.


A "Taco Day" segment featured a phone call with Brian "Q" Quinn from *Impractical Jokers*, who mistakenly believed a bizarre song played on the show was one of their bits, envisioning Opie with plastic surgery.  The hosts invited him to be a guest.  This transitioned into another “Jack Tover” segment focusing on Scott and Todd. Scott's seemingly outdated views and Todd's constant attempts to cut him off were mocked, their dynamic compared to a son hating an immortal father.  A studio interview with Paul Williams followed, covering his career, struggles with addiction, and work on various projects, interspersed with the hosts’ frequent interruptions and jokes. Opie's unexpected cold-call request for a piano performance, despite Williams' inability to play, was a notable moment.  The show also mentioned negative interview experiences with Tom Sizemore, Ed Asner (who allegedly told Anthony to "go fuck himself"), and Ben Stein (a phone interview that went awry).  Further anecdotes about inappropriate celebrity behavior were shared.   Racial slurs and other offensive language were used throughout.


The show continued with a discussion of past bad interviews and celebrity encounters.  Negative experiences with Kristen Bell (Opie hung up on her), Linda Blair ("The power of Christ compels you"), Amanda Peet (Opie made an arguably inappropriate comment about her appearance), Tommy Lee, Megan McCain, Bobby Brady, and Meadow Soprano (who reportedly cried) were recounted. A midget stripper's tearful audition was also mentioned.  This led into a "Worst of the Week" countdown, culminating in the revelation that Opie accidentally broadcast E-Rock's phone number live on air. This sparked a frantic discussion about the consequences, with Opie offering to pay for E-Rock's Disney vacation and a new phone. Commercial breaks and a call-in segment with Jay Moore and Will Sasso followed. They discussed Moore's podcast, Sasso's Vine videos, and a GoDaddy.com contest judged by Sasso, where the third-place prize was oral sex from Jay Moore.  The segment concluded with further discussion about E-Rock's predicament and the "Worst of the Week" countdown.


The final segment featured Jay Moore discussing a website contest, focusing on the vulgar interpretations of entries like "SpillingMyJizz.com," "NoBitingMan.com," and "synthetic, well-coiffed, upper-lipped facialhair.com."  Extensive, crude jokes and tangents ensued, with Will Sasso suggesting G-rated content for the winning website.  Sasso then recounted a professional wrestling match with Bret Hart, detailing the choreography and their intentional loss without hitting Hart.  Further off-color discussions regarding Sasso's personal life, including his views on relationships, children, and a hurricane anecdote, were included.  Numerous advertisements were interspersed throughout this segment.

[00:03:30]  Here's your host, what's his name, Faith?  Welcome, welcome, you know what time it is, Worst of the Week Countdown time with me, Sam Roberts.  You know me from Opie and Anthony.  We're highlighting all the awesomeness that went down this week on the O&A show.  Opie did probably the worst thing he's ever done to E-Rock this week.  And anybody who's been listening for any amount of time knows that that can't possibly be good.  Literally the worst thing he's ever done.  Jocktober started this week. 
[00:04:00]  The wonderful Meghan McCain was in studio.  Paul Williams was in studio.  Nick DiPaolo was in studio.  But I wanted to start out, you know, we were talking about Jocktober, and we did some special edition Jocktobers this week.  We had a whole issue with Fez from the Ron and Fez show.  Now, Fez decided to take umbrage with a television commercial that used the word crazy over and over again.  So to start Jocktober, we decided to listen to Fez and his take on this commercial that he deemed inappropriate. 
[00:04:30]  All right.  How many more clips of this?  We have six.  I mean, they're really good.  They went on for a little while.  Okay.  I mean, we can, you know, throw in the towel or pick our...  No, no, no.  Let's hear the second clip.  Let's hear a little more.  I'm all in so far.  I don't mean to offend athletes when I say throw in the towel.  Anybody who's ever had to... 
[00:05:00]  That's true.  Throw in the towel.  ...do the injury or otherwise, I apologize.  That's true.  Yeah.  So this is...  The next clip is Fez talking about corporate America being insensitive.  I think it's very insulting.  And when the Burger King commercial came out...  All right.  Let me see it from the beginning.  Okay.  Because I don't want you to go into a Burger King because I have no idea what that one  is either.  I don't know that this is a thing.  All right.  This is up on the iBang and see...  What is it as? 
[00:05:30]  Corporate America.  Not as everyone friendly as they think.  I don't know what even that means.  Because corporate America is always saying, no, we're always making sure that we're taking  care of the needs of our customers.  We're sensitive to people.  This is really nuts.  And this is really insensitive.  Fuck sensitivity.  You're fucking nuts, dude.  Thank you, Ron.  You're fucking wack out.  Bizarre.  Insane.  Paranoid.  Fuck sensitivity. 
[00:06:00]  Holy shit.  First of all, I need to white out so I can get back to try to find out.  Because if you played this for me a million times, I would say, lazy, probably, dumb, doesn't  really push the product, but insensitive or cruel, no.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Ronnie's great.  Ronnie, just, you're crazy.  You're insane.  You are nuts.  You are nuts.  He lost it on this one. 
[00:06:30]  And it's not, I mean, if Fez is a bit or a character, because, I mean, his name is not  Fez.  Uh-huh.  That's the life he's chosen to live.  The character in the bit is him as a person.  That's him.  It's him.  I don't even want an if in there.  He's not a character.  What goes on?  I don't get to listen to the show as much as I would like because I'm home by the time  it comes on.  And I have to waste an hour listening to some drivel between 10 and 11.  You're talking about Wednesdays or every day except Wednesday? 
[00:07:00]  Oh, Wednesday, I like.  Damn it.  But does he talk about, like, his personal, like, what he does at night or off the show?  Is there...  No, they'll ask him, you know, have you sucked any dick?  And he'll go, oh, Jesus.  He'll go, no.  But, like, there's a line between maybe catching a movie and sucking dick.  Right.  Like, there's other things.  Well, he doesn't do stuff.  In there.  They busted him yesterday because I think he had said he wasn't going to watch the Buccaneers 
[00:07:30]  anymore because of the Trayvon Martin thing.  Wait, what?  Right.  Tampa Bay Buccaneers, right?  I believe they said because...  What?  What's the law in Florida that everybody hates?  Stand your ground?  Right.  Because of the stand your ground thing.  He can't be a Tampa Bay Buccaneers fan anymore?  He said he wasn't going to watch the Bucs anymore.  And then they busted him because they got him to admit he was watching them on a laptop. 
[00:08:00]  And then he said it was because they're going to look at stand your ground.  They're going to look at it again.  Holy mother of God!  You're joking, right?  No, dude.  If he's pulling a work, it's brilliant.  He's not, though.  If he's pulling a work, it's a seven-year work.  It's a seven-year work.  Yeah.  All right, let's go.  All right.  Okay, this is...  Oh, Fez gets...  He's surprised that there aren't more groups speaking up against this commercial.  Because they're too crazy to know that it's even going on. 
[00:08:30]  And they're not even crazy enough to be offended by it.  Right.  Yes.  I don't get it.  I don't get how you could be offended by that.  Well, first of all, I'm offended that Chevrolet would think it's okay to keep using those words over and over again.  We use those words over and over again on this show.  You do, too.  And I'm more offended by mental health groups not calling them out on this.  Why are they letting this thing go by? 
[00:09:00]  Dude, your fucking eyes are...  Because they're too busy dealing with crazy people!  That point.  This is you leaving Earth.  It's done now.  I was shocked when I saw this yesterday.  And I'm sure it played all day Saturday, too.  You're shocked because you think your toaster is trying to kill you.  Oh, my God.  That takes wacky to a whole new level.  Wacky?  That's not a good word, either.  Mm-mm.  Can't say wacky, right?  That means, um...  Well, it harkens back to, yeah.  To crazy.  Yeah. 
[00:09:30]  You think it's going to be awkward in the halls today?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, Fez will probably blame me for this whole thing.  Will he?  He's done it before.  Whatever.  He's blamed you?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Who else has taken the brunt of Fez's blame around here for things?  Uh, like, who's Fez been angry at on the show?  Yeah, Opie, right?  Yeah, but usually if Opie will say something...  Well, why is he mad at me?  When Opie takes his shots at Fez...  Right.  Fez likes to act like I'm like...  Well, why is he mad at me? 
[00:10:00]  Because you take a lot of shots at him.  No, I don't.  All the time.  Because you're the catalyst?  Yeah.  Yeah, Fez thinks that, like, I'm putting him up to it, when in reality it's because he  doesn't want to fight with Opie, so, you know...  Oh, okay.  Look, he's offended, right?  Oh, yeah.  But, to this day, he's done the most offensive thing around here.  And what's that?  And trust me, I didn't even care when he did that.  Uh-huh.  What did he do?  He walked around here as Hitler.  With a real Hitler mustache, not one you could go by. 
[00:10:30]  You're right, he did do that.  I don't think you could be more offensive than that.  Do you think that's really offensive, though?  But now, you fast forward a few years, and he has a problem with the word crazy?  It takes a crazy person to walk around as Hitler!  And then he walked through Times Square with a real Hitler mustache, wearing only a diaper.  Well, that's just funny.  He pronounced himself as Baby Hitler.  Baby Hitler.  And he gelled his hair to the side. 
[00:11:00]  Yeah, yeah, like Hitler.  But that's the subtleness of, like, over-the-top offensive and then funny.  Right.  Baby Hitler.  Baby Hitler.  Not many people are going to deny.  That's funny.  However...  But coming in here as Hitler, completely dressed as Hitler...  You think some Jewish people might have been...  In uniform and everything.  Yeah, wasn't he?  Didn't he bombard the show one day in uniform?  Yes.  As Hitler?  Yes.  Do you think some Jewish people might be offended by that?  He did, I forgot.  He showed up in uniform and bombarded the show as Hitler. 
[00:11:30]  I refer to my Hitler video that I made back in the day on my YouTube channel, OP Radio.  Oh, that's a classic.  You've got some serious tweeting to do today.  I sure do.  I am.  Because when it's talked about on the show, I've got to tweet those videos out.  Go to...  I'm serious.  Yeah, I totally forgot.  That's like on the MeTV version of your YouTube.  It's like all the classic shows.  Yeah.  So you've got...  Oh, my God.  All right.  This is the same guy that now has a problem with the word crazy. 
[00:12:00]  He's here.  You did not come to work like that.  This is not work.  This is a mission.  Fezzy has arrived from the Lana Fez show dressed up exactly like Hitler if Hitler was really fat.  Casual Hitler.  Oh, my God.  We're in jeans.  Did you just say if Hitler was really fat?  What?  Oh, my goodness.  That's a problem now.  I don't think so, but I think it's funny. 
[00:12:30]  Okay.  Wow.  But he does have a brown shirt on and not a tie.  He looks like Al Hitler.  And your hair is...  You've got the Hitler hair, not only the mustache now.  Some people are just blessed with the good jeans.  Oh, the jeans.  Oh, I see.  Al Watley is here to invite you to a party.  Oh, a party.  National Socialist Party.  He just did the Hitler salute. 
[00:13:00]  September 24th.  Yeah, he raised his arm.  Yeah, yeah.  He did the Hitler salute.  And the curtains aren't closed, so any Jew that passed by would...  He walked around the halls.  No, he walked around like that all day.  Oh, that's right.  Yeah.  You know, I know of a guy that did some controversial things on our show, and I want him to look at  this to see how it, you know, stacks up.  Troy Kwan needs to...  No, no, no, no.  He's seen it.  He knows.  He doesn't really...  He doesn't feel one way or the other about it, to tell you the truth.  But he almost got fired for saying some outrageous things. 
[00:13:30]  And Fez is now...  This ain't even on his radar.  You sure?  Yeah, he doesn't feel...  He knows it happened.  He doesn't feel one way or the other.  Oh, we should do that.  We could do 20 minutes on that.  No, to tell you the truth, it'll just be boring.  Don't even worry about it.  We could eat up a quarter hour with that shit.  No, no, no, no, no.  It'll be boring.  He doesn't have an opinion.  Let me hear more Fez as Hitler.  Oh, I was about to say.  And then we'll go back to what he did yesterday.  Do you want to hear Fez offended by the word crazy or Fez dressed up and talking like Hitler?  He's out of his mind about the word crazy in a commercial. 
[00:14:00]  So, I just want to remind Fez that maybe he shouldn't take on these causes.  But what is this, 10 years ago?  All in fairness, probably two years, maybe three.  Three years, maybe.  At most.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  September 24th.  Yeah, the date?  Nine.  Oh.  24.  Oh, nine.  Okay.  Oh, four years ago.  At South NYC, I broadcast for the Ron and Fez show. 
[00:14:30]  I will be attending, by the way.  We need you, Brother Kumia.  I will attend.  I enjoy everything you do.  As we put the right back together.  What?  Brother Kumia, Brother Anthony, Brother Joe, Italy, Germany.  Right.  We were pals at one point.  United as it should be.  As it should be.  You're absolutely right.  Ted Hughes, you will be there?  Hell no.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I just.  Jim Norton, you are an uninvited guest to the party. 
[00:15:00]  Oh.  A to the H was watching TV last night.  Yeah, A to the H.  Sam Robertson, not invited.  Oh, man.  Uh-oh.  Don't make him fury, Rudeus.  Ha, ha, ha.  So.  Is this legal?  Can I point out that Ant's wearing the exact same shirt as the video?  I'm dressed the same as I was four years ago.  It's just that the mustache is missing now?  Yes.  You went through the mustache stage?  Yes, I did.  But you're wearing the exact same shirt. 
[00:15:30]  I'm wearing the same little 5'11 army shirt.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm not saying I'm a fashion plate, you know.  Is there more to this video?  I didn't.  Eh, it's probably the same stuff.  We should maybe go back.  Very well.  So.  Yeah.  There's Fez dressed up as Hitler for the day with the authentic Hitler mustache.  Now, while you.  But he has a problem with the word crazy in a car ad.  You remind Fez that he once dressed up as Hitler and came in here and spoke like Hitler. 
[00:16:00]  In this clip, Ron reminds Fez of a commercial that was very famous for a very long time.  Oh, really?  Okay.  And I do want to say again, I don't give a fuck if he walks around here as Hitler.  Of course not.  That's my point.  But the guy that does that probably should have more of an open mind about the word crazy in a commercial.  I think like if they would have showed people that they came up and they're like wearing like robes and they're spitting and drooling down their face. 
[00:16:30]  And then they said, you can't buy this car.  You're crazy.  You don't belong here.  You're a crazy person and should be taken out of society.  I might be able to say, well, I can see that or how why that would offend some people.  But saying a deal is so good that it's crazy and insane.  We've done that forever.  Remember the guy that used to sell the fucking crazy Eddie?  Yeah.  My price is so low.  It's insane. 
[00:17:00]  We're going crazy.  I've got to go get those deals.  Yeah.  And you're like, those fucking speakers, $8 for speakers that will last through one song.  I've got to get them.  Crazy Eddie.  That's true.  Of course.  Crazy Eddie.  Made a living off the word crazy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then Ron starts reminding Fez of songs that have the word crazy in the title.  Right.  And Fez says something that invalidates some of his arguments. 
[00:17:30]  Some of his arguments.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Why?  Because he likes one of the crazy songs?  No, it's phrasing.  Okay.  It doesn't really make sense to what he's saying.  All right.  All right.  Now, when the Burger King...  Do you know how many fucking songs are called crazy?  Willie Nelson had a big song by that.  CeeLo had a big song like that.  Seal had a big song like that.  Beyonce had Crazy in Love.  You're fucking nuts, dude. 
[00:18:00]  Seriously.  Your paranoia is frightening me right now.  Those are also just...  Those are artists.  This is a corporation that's supposed to be...  Why do you care?  It's supposed to be what?  Selling cars.  That's supposed to be friendly to Americans of all kind.  No, you're not...  Crazy is not a kind.  It's not an ethnic group.  It's something that can happen to some people, and then you get meds to get out of being crazy. 
[00:18:30]  You don't settle in and become happily crazy the way you have.  I'm proud to be crazy.  You're not a crazy American.  As a crazy American...  No.  Our people have brought so much to this country.  Business help.  Oh, my God.  I don't want my daughter bringing home one of those crazy people.  If they get the same commercial, and I don't like to use this word, but inserted the word... 
[00:19:00]  Don't say the N-word.  No, I'm not.  I'm not.  If they put in, oh, this interior, it's retarded, people would be going insane.  You know what?  I don't like to use that word.  I thought of...  Oh, God.  He just said insane.  Right.  He had no problem.  He just said insane.  People would go insane.  He just said it.  And he said that people would go insane.  That doesn't make any sense. 
[00:19:30]  See how easy and natural it is to just use that word as the...  Oh, boy.  And you should be able to say this interior is retarded.  Because we all know what that means, too.  That's retarded.  Retarded meaning in a really good way.  Oh, it's retarded.  We used that word in a good way growing up.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, fuck.  That's retarded, man.  Oh, yeah.  If somebody's insane, they need to be locked up.  Right.  Because they can't function in a society.  They're insane.  Now, is that me saying I am anti-insane American? 
[00:20:00]  You are.  And, you know, Fez proved on our point here, we don't want any words fucking banned.  None.  Not a one.  No.  And this is what we said with the nappy-headed hoes and the N-word.  We said when they get the N-word, they're going to go for the other word.  And I think faggot was the second word.  And then they got rid of midget.  And they got rid of retard.  Jeez.  All those words now are taboo.  Yeah.  In most social circles. 
[00:20:30]  Certainly in mainstream media.  Oh, my God.  You can't say any of those words anymore.  None of them.  So now if we take fucking Fez's lead, then we add crazy to that list.  Do you know?  And then they don't stop there.  That's the problem.  No, they keep going.  That's why you got to say no to all this shit.  When you start hanging out with somebody new, that's like the mark.  You know that you're real friends.  Because after you hang out like five times, then they can use the word retarded around you.  And you go, oh, okay, cool.  We're there.  We're cool now. 
[00:21:00]  Yeah, yeah.  It's a different word for me when I hang out with new people.  And when they use it, I'm like, nice.  Now I know we can hang out.  Right, right.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, we know what word we're talking about.  Huh?  Huh?  We know your word.  Yes, guns.  Guns.  How many more clips of this craziness?  One more clip.  We've still got 30 seconds on this one.  Oh.  Craziness.  All right.  It's retarded.  People would be going insane.  You know what?  I don't like to use that word. 
[00:21:30]  I thought of it.  Oh, you tried to cover.  Yeah, you did, and it just rolled off your tongue like I've heard you say it a million  times.  Huh.  If they would have said this, this would have really pissed people off.  Oops.  Cunty.  My God, this interior is as soft as a cunt.  So get your cunt out to your local Chevy dealer.  You're fucking nuts, dude.  Seriously.  You're not coming back.  In the world that I knew.  Wow. 
[00:22:00]  He's right about the cunt thing.  He is.  People would be outraged.  Cunty.  I think that would be a cool commercial, though.  That would be.  I would buy a car if the interior was soft as a cunt.  It's an attention getter, too.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, it is.  That would turn your head to the TV in a second if you heard that.  Yeah.  Did he just say it?  He said it again.  What?  I know the auto industry is hurting a little bit, too.  You want to come back.  Come back.  Get that commercial out there this Sunday during football.  Detroit, I hope you're listening.  You'll have the whole world talking about your product. 
[00:22:30]  Fuck rich Corinthian leather.  Right.  I want a cunty interior.  Right.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  Soft as a.  As a nice cunt.  Soft as a cunt.  I was going to say teen cunt.  Jesus.  Let's see.  We have one more clip.  All right.  Okay.  And in this clip, Fez suggests what word they could have used instead of crazy.  Oh.  Yeah.  Okay.  If the joke of the commercial was they keep using the same word over and over again, you 
[00:23:00]  could have used anything.  She could have just kept using the word awesome over again and could have gotten corrected on  that.  Corrected how?  I was going to say, I said fantastic.  I thought you were going to say awesome.  It would have been the exact same joke of this dull commercial.  I think Toyota used awesome in their ads years ago.  Awesome.  Probably.  We are driven. 
[00:23:30]  It offended really cool people.  Yeah.  I guess so.  You realize that there were no human beings that were mentally deficient or challenged in  this at all, right?  Yes.  It was just two people saying that this deal is so good, it must be unreal, i.e. crazy.  That's how we have said, these are crazy prices.  Prices so low, you're going insane. 
[00:24:00]  You've never gotten furious about these commercials before.  See, I think that's the same excuse as saying that's so gay and saying, no, I didn't mean  it in a homosexual way.  And I'm looking at you now and your eyes are not fixating on me.  I don't know what they're doing with your meds, but the paranoia is gigantic now.  Holy shit.  And where are the mental health groups that stuck up, that went after Burger King in 
[00:24:30]  their commercial?  This is not even fun.  He's insane.  Yeah.  Because he doesn't even listen to what Ronnie's saying.  No, Ronnie...  He just keeps, like, he's got the point, he's going to just, like, over and over again  say the exact same fucking thing.  Fez Watley come cruising.  You look into his eyes, he doesn't even seem to be thinking.  Till they roll over white.  This is so off the rails.  I want to think it's just a silly bit.  It's not.  I know it's not.  You give him a counter-argument, and instead of either countering that or saying, you know 
[00:25:00]  what, you're right, I didn't think of it that way.  No, he doesn't...  He goes back to the first thing.  No, he doesn't hear the other side of arguments.  The Worst of the Week Countdown.  On the O.P. Anthony channel, The Worst of the Week Countdown continues.  Moving right along with The Worst of the Week Countdown, of course, I'm Sam Roberts.  And still to come is Colin Quinn calling in, Nick DiPaolo in studio, Meghan McCain in studio,  Paul Williams in studio, more Jocktober, Opie doing the single worst thing that he's ever 
[00:25:30]  done to EROC.  But before we get to all that, Ron and Fez, we played a minute ago Fez talking about that  commercial and saying how crazy is not an appropriate word to use in it.  Well, Ron and Fez talked about our discussion, Fez in particular, and thought I was attacking  him.  Yeah, you don't believe this.  He's lost his mind.  Listen to us going over Fez's response to us. 
[00:26:00]  Well, apparently yesterday got a lot of heat when we talked about Fez, Fez on the Ron and  Fez show.  Fez was upset that a commercial used the word crazy and insane in the commercial.  I have not.  So we should play for you really fast.  Yeah, I have not heard it.  Yeah.  We were all stupefied by this one from Fez, to be honest with you.  He couldn't fathom that people weren't upset and offended by the use of the word crazy. 
[00:26:30]  And to Ron's credit, he just, he didn't, he didn't know what to say.  Ronnie instantly went.  Ronnie almost didn't know what to say for the first time.  He said, you're nuts.  Yeah.  He couldn't believe that this is the cause that Fez has taken up.  Yeah, yeah.  Right.  And it's no joke.  This is real.  I imagine he is real.  Sam brought this to our attention, by the way. 
[00:27:00]  That's pretty much it.  That is it.  And he thinks that's just, we shouldn't be throwing that word around lightly.  Well, especially corporate America shouldn't be throwing that word around lightly.  In fairness, you know, it's insensitive.  It's very insensitive. 
[00:27:30]  I fucking hate you.  Ronnie had a great angle on it.  He goes, people that, when you have words like retarded and, what's another, oh, oh, oh,  fans of ours, queer, gay, nigger, you know, they, they, it's, it's, oh, I have to throw  that out there.  He just wanted to.  He's like, oh, I got a chance to say it.  He wanted to say that one first.  I could.  Let me, let me pad this.  His father's called him. 
[00:28:00]  Let me pad it before I say what I really want to say.  You have to pad it.  I'm kidding.  You have to pad it.  You think Reed Twight was padding?  Oh, all that was.  Absolutely.  He couldn't wait to get to the word.  He couldn't wait.  But, but all those things that Ronnie had a great point.  He says, uh, like people that are called those words and want them eliminated, they  are proud of, of who they are and they don't want to be called a certain thing.  He goes, but crazy and insane people, they're not proud that they're crazy and insane. 
[00:28:30]  So they don't have like this thing like, oh, you're misusing the word or calling us that  where, where crazy Americans.  It was a, it was a, really a great, uh, a great point.  And, and then, uh, as, as, as Fez addressed it, he didn't acknowledge it at all.  It went right to reiterate.  Well, it doesn't really, there's a, there's times where he doesn't listen to the advice  Ronnie.  No, Ronnie was saying your eyes are spinning around in your head.  Ronnie makes some great points.  And Fez at times, I would have to say, uh, doesn't really hear Ron. 
[00:29:00]  Yeah.  Which is, which is amazing to me.  He's just waiting for Ron to stop talking.  Yeah.  And I think the Chevrolet commercial should have went further.  We said it yesterday.  Have a crazy guy in the backseat after all that.  After they used the word crazy a bunch of times, then you go to the backseat and there's  a guy in a fucking straight jacket.  Uh-huh.  I probably would have ran out and bought a Chevrolet if they did that.  Right?  Exactly.  It'd be funny.  The old days, they would have done that.  Sure.  Not anymore, because we are kind of sensitive douchebags now, but. 
[00:29:30]  Mm-hmm.  So anyway, Fez went off.  And then when Fez was making his argument, he used the word insane.  Yeah.  As he was.  Did he really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Which fucking.  His quote was.  Blows up his whole point.  Blows his quote there.  He goes, if they had used the word retarded in that commercial, people would have gone insane.  Right.  Yeah.  It was like, well, you just said people would have gone insane.  Right.  Proving how much in the, just the regular vernacular.  Of course.  Yeah.  That's how you didn't like the word vernacular.  I never said that. 
[00:30:00]  You destroyed me for saying vernacular.  Yeah, you.  You're dumb.  I'm supposed to say smart things.  You're dumb.  Ah.  Ah, geez.  So, it was the whole thing on our show, and then I guess everyone couldn't wait to listen  to Ron and Fez yesterday.  If you remember.  And then Fez, I guess Fez wants all words banned, because.  Oh, everything should be.  You know.  Why? 
[00:30:30]  I think that's his cause.  He wants all words banned.  Oh, so he can get, he just wants to get behind that?  Think, think about it.  Oh, if every word is banned.  Think about it.  Oh.  Think about it.  That's a thinking man.  That's a joke.  That's perfect.  I'm there.  You get it.  Every single word gets banned.  There you go.  Well, he's sort of doing that already.  Right.  Yeah.  Is the, uh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'll say this about Fez.  No, he's not talking much, because he wants every word banned.  See, it's not as fun if you sing that way. 
[00:31:00]  Mm.  Uh, yes, Jimmy.  I think Fez is, you know, he's, he's kind of, uh, he's kind of, I guess, he came out of  the closet.  He's at the, he's at a big couple of years, but you can't get bogged down in language,  in the fucking language.  Like, I know what he's, he's just trying to, I guess, make things that he feels are wrong,  right?  Uh-huh.  It's like, you don't want to get caught up in the, the little nitpicky stuff that you  as a radio guy hate, because that's not where the fucking battle is won.  Like, you don't win people by saying, don't use crazy in a commercial, when you know that 
[00:31:30]  the intent is not to be horrible.  Right.  You know, it's like, he should be fighting other battles, because he's trying to, you  know.  Right.  He's trying to find his way, right?  He's gay, and he doesn't want to hear people yelling faggot, and I understand that.  Like, he's probably, it probably always bothered him, but now he feels like he can speak  up, and he doesn't have to be quiet about it, but it's like, still, even though you  can speak up, you shouldn't harp on that, because you're not going to win anything or  that.  Well, the Ron and Fez show is very interesting.  It took Fez two hours to talk about the situation, which is brilliant on Fez's part, because, 
[00:32:00]  man, you know, they ate up quarter hours yesterday.  We were just explaining the eating up of quarter hours thing the other day.  Yep.  On regular radio, that was your goal, to eat up those quarter hours, meaning keeping those  people tuned to the fucking show.  I was tuned in.  By teasing shit.  I got home, and immediately turned on the Ron and Fez show in my house.  And you guys said, who would Fez be upset with?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Because this whole, because we talked about the commercial on the air, we brought the 
[00:32:30]  clips, and you said, who do you think Fez is going to be upset with?  Yes, and it was...  What did I say?  Right on the money, Sam Roberts said he would be upset with Sam Roberts.  Strictly with me, because he's not going to...  But he also had a little scenario as to why you did this.  Well, we got the clips.  Oh, it's brilliant.  We got the clips.  I loved it.  I just want to point out one of the things Ronnie does very well. 
[00:33:00]  Yeah.  Dare I say it's brilliant.  Yeah.  When we have some info that we want to do on our show, we do it at 6.02.  We can't wait.  We can't wait.  We suck.  We start babbling right away.  You think he has Art Bell's skills?  Ronnie sits back, and he goes, hey, I know I have a bigger audience today, because people  want to know what's going on after the Opie and Anthony show.  And he just sits back in his fucking chair and takes it all in, and he's all about, I'll  get to it eventually.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:33:30]  Also, we have to babble right off the bat about it.  Do you think we panic and just start...  We can't wait.  We fucking regurgitate the information immediately.  Ronnie's talking college football for a little while.  I'll get there.  Fucking amazing.  The pacing that that man has is wonderful.  It's a true fucking gift, just sitting back like that.  And he knew.  And two hours in, it all went down.  Yep.  Because he finally spoke up.  Was he there the whole time? 
[00:34:00]  No, he left.  Well, he was, but then he left for a while.  Do we have that part?  I don't know if they referenced him leaving, but we do have the clip of Ron asking him about  leaving.  Why he left.  Yeah, yeah.  Wait, so you could just leave a radio show?  Well, Ronnie didn't like that.  Much.  No.  To just leave.  You could just leave.  That would rule.  And by the way, throughout the two hours of Fez not talking, there were people calling  in saying, where's Fez today?  Right.  And Ron just said, well, he's here.  He's having an off day.  And then he would just move on to college football or whatever else. 
[00:34:30]  So Fez finally spoke up yesterday on the show about the whole crazy controversy that maybe  we pushed a little forward.  It started on Ron's show.  Yeah.  We just got the clips because we couldn't believe it.  We couldn't believe this is the cause he wanted to take up.  Any radio show that we caught wind was doing this, we would play the clips, especially on  this platform, especially on this channel.  Right.  Yeah.  Of course.  So Fez finally spoke. 
[00:35:00]  Fez, you haven't said a word.  Yes, it is.  And it is almost one o'clock and you ran off to the bathroom, I guess, to either shit or  throw up?  Mm-hmm.  Which one?  Throw up.  What are you upset about?  Uh, just Sam's attack on me today on the O&A show.  Why would that make you throw up?  Just because I'm upset.  It's just, it's, it's, you know, putting it under the guise of Jocktober, but I know exactly  what it's about. 
[00:35:30]  I know exactly why Sam does this now.  It's under the guise of Jocktober?  Yeah, that's, I mean, that's how he presented his stuff today, you know, uh, clips of, of  me yesterday on the show trying to explain why I was upset about the Chevrolet commercial.  Fez, in all honesty, you were a babbling lunatic yesterday.  This is your show now, Sam.  Congratulations.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You finally did it.  Yeah.  How does that, how would it occur to any person? 
[00:36:00]  Well, he put two and two together as far as why you did it.  Like, the whole, not only were all you guys involved in like, yes, please.  I didn't say shit.  You said lots of shit.  I didn't say nothing.  A ton of it.  But the entire staff was in the office going, yeah, we got to present these clips to O&A  tomorrow.  Just saying everybody was involved and Fez doesn't want to acknowledge that for whatever  reason.  100%.  Fez continues.  Sam did this just because of the Troy Kwan situation. 
[00:36:30]  That's all this is about.  Wow.  I didn't get to hear this.  Dude.  Wow.  I had to get my kid to school.  I was bummed that Ronnie didn't address this the first hour because that's when I was  listening.  Wow.  Even I was like, I did not see this coming.  So Fez was one of the guys that really had a problem with the Troy Kwan stuff.  Yeah.  Well, Fez went on the air immediately after the Troy Kwan fight that got him in trouble. 
[00:37:00]  Oh, right.  And said he was scared and stuff.  And said he felt threatened.  Felt threatened that Troy would be.  That's just silly.  Silly.  Because he knows Troy wouldn't do shit.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He wouldn't even do shit on the air.  But that was like the first major negative reaction that Troy got from that fight.  Was from Fezzy?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  So he ramped it up a little bit?  Oh, boy.  I don't know if he ramped it up or that's how he felt.  But he...  You can see where Fezzy's coming from, certainly. 
[00:37:30]  So that's why you have this vendetta against Fez?  Yeah.  Why are you hassling Fez?  Yeah.  So he thinks this is our way of getting back at Fez.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  That's the wrong pronoun.  I mean, no.  Oh, you.  It's Sam Roberts' way of getting back at Fez.  Because, obviously, the Opie and Anthony show is being manipulated by one puppet master and  that man's name is Sam Roberts.  I don't think anybody would deny that.  That's fairly true.  It's just me, huh?  Absolutely.  Yeah.  Congratulations to me, then.  Yeah.  Because for some reason, I'm still getting blamed for that. 
[00:38:00]  And so Sam's going to try to take it out on me any which way he can, instead of just  saying that.  Where I'm supposedly to blame for a suspension.  Well, let me make this clear to every...  We've never said that.  Nobody said it.  Have we ever said that?  No.  No.  No.  I've got to say, we've never said that.  I didn't say that.  I hired someone to sky write it, but I never said it.  Nobody's ever said that.  It hasn't even come up, like, in a joking form. 
[00:38:30]  Wow, why would he say that?  Yeah, we've never said that.  No, we actually said...  We were kind of mad at Fez that, you know, he was misreading the situation, because there's  no reason why Fez should be worried about Troy Kwan ever.  But then we knew he had gone to management and said, you know, hey, don't do anything, you  know.  Yeah, I knew that.  We knew he did that, yeah, which was cool.  Right.  That's fine.  I haven't thought about Fez and Troy Kwan's interaction since it happened.  Right.  You're not very nice. 
[00:39:00]  Wow, we never said that, Fezzy.  Nobody did.  No one on this show thinks that.  Well, let me make this clear to everybody out there.  The only time I went down the fucking hallway about Troy was to tell management, don't fire  the guy.  I shook my hand at my wedding.  That was the one trip I made.  I never asked for a suspension.  I never asked for the guy to lose his job.  I went down the hallway to say, don't fire him. 
[00:39:30]  You little scamps get together.  But this is being projected on me.  And trust me, I found out later there was a contingency of people upstairs upset by that  day.  What exactly is a contingency?  A large group.  Okay.  A large group of people upset that day that went to one of the outcube guys to go down  the hallway, talk to management, and have something done about it.  I wasn't part of that group, and I told them, I don't want anything to happen to the guy, 
[00:40:00]  but this is Sam's way of retaliation because this is going on and Troy's not on the air.  I can't disagree.  That's what this is all fucking about.  Absolutely.  And so I'm letting everyone know, I didn't have anything to do with that.  So what you're saying is you're taking this all in the spirit of good fun.  Ronnie knows how to break that tension.  Absolutely.  With a quick line, man. 
[00:40:30]  But he's incorrect.  That's not how Fez is taking it.  Oh, Jimmy, see what he did.  Why would I care if Troy Kwan's on the air or not?  Well, I mean, you like Troy.  Yeah, I like him.  I could see Fez's point if this was more of a cause, but he wants the word crazy, Ben,  from a Chevrolet commercial.  Oh, right.  Of course we're going to bring that to our show.  That's crazy talk.  Why did I pull the blueberries clip?  Right.  Oh, come on.  Oh, boy.  Remember when he said that blueberries was a standalone fruit? 
[00:41:00]  It is a standalone fruit.  It's one of my favorite things ever.  Yeah.  It's a good moment.  And I didn't pull that because of a vendetta.  We all have shitty moments.  Yeah.  That's one of the greatest shitty moments of all time.  It's funny.  It's wonderful.  Yes.  That's right.  It's happened to all of us.  I will say this.  Where you try something and it fails miserably and then you're incredibly uncomfortable and  trying to get yourself out of it.  It's a home run.  It's a home run.  And not only a home run, it's out of the ballpark itself. 
[00:41:30]  It's a fucking home run.  It's a monster home run.  And if I had a secret vendetta, why would I wait a month after Troy gets back before I  did anything?  You're trying to oversell this, Sam.  Relax.  It's fine.  Yeah.  If you got a secret vendetta, just be a man and say it.  We all know.  It's fine.  Nobody actually takes this seriously is what you're saying?  No.  There's not a person that believes that this is why we brought the crazy shit to the show  yesterday.  All right, then.  And then I got told later on as well that the stuff I was really upset about had nothing 
[00:42:00]  to do with it whatsoever.  That that wasn't even going to be looked at.  So why did you throw up?  Why are you upset?  Why can't you just act like it's no big deal?  Because to me, it is a big deal to get attacked like that.  And it's all Sam because he's upset about what happened with Troy.  And that, I mean, I vocalized it on the air, but I didn't have anything to do with any repercussions.  That can't be further from the truth. 
[00:42:30]  It could be possibly.  And you should have, you know, if it bothered you, you should have talked about it on the  show.  It makes for great radio.  So what if he was bothered by what Troy did, of course, that's fine.  Like it is what it is, but there's no secret vendettas here.  I don't think anybody.  Well, yeah, but you've had a weird thing with him since that incident.  Boy, have you found it to be so?  Yeah, it was odd.  Oh, my God.  You're going to get Fezzy going. 
[00:43:00]  What?  Yes, he is.  Yes, he is.  Sam coming in going, look, we can get, let's do this.  And we're like, why don't you leave him alone?  And he's fucking, comes in with something else.  Sam, you don't like the gays?  Jim's devil's advocate routine is not good for somebody who is obviously irrationally paranoid.  Right.  Yeah.  See, you're calling him paranoid.  I don't think he's paranoid.  He is paranoid.  Are you a fan of the gays?  I love the gays.  You love the gays?  You want to make that point today?  The gays are some of my favorite people on this planet.  Very insincere. 
[00:43:30]  I've never heard you say that before.  I don't think anybody's upset.  I'm upset.  Why are you upset?  I'm upset because Sam's pulling this shit on me.  Just because he's upset about something I didn't do.  Upset?  That would take it to the point where Sam cared about Troy.  I don't believe that's true.  Sam only cares about Sam.  So that's the problem with the logic of this. 
[00:44:00]  The one character judgment I can't disagree with.  Yep.  I mean, I heard that yesterday.  I was like, oh yeah, Ronnie hits it right on the head.  Hell of an argument.  Yep.  That was a bit too real right there.  It's all he's got is to try to look for someone's fuck-ups.  You know, all these years he's been doing that show, and that's all he's got at this  point?  Absolutely.  Is, uh, oh, E-Rock ate something, Sal was late, whatever.  Yep, Sal was late. 
[00:44:30]  Why are you angry?  He's got a point there.  Because I know what this is about now.  Yes.  And I'm putting it out there.  It's not a big deal.  You don't find it slightly funny that we were part of Jocktober after all these years?  I mean, how is that funny?  You don't find it slightly funny?  Ronnie was honored to be part of Jocktober.

[00:49:00]  Here's a car question.  How does rust get in to destroy your engine's fuel system?  It's caused by water, attracted by the ethanol that's in your gas tank right now.  Ethanol is in nearly every gallon of retail gas.  It attracts 50% more water than unleaded.  And with water, that means corrosion can begin at any time.  But you can protect your engine with the BG ethanol defender service.  BG cleans, dries, and protects the entire fuel system.  And you can find this service at a shop near you at BGfindashop.com. 
[00:49:30]  Remember these two letters.  BG.  The worst of the week of today.  No.  Continues.  That's right.  Going over all the wonderful moments on the Opie and Anthony show this week.  This is the worst of the week countdown.  And I'm Sam Roberts.  Still to come, Opie did the worst thing he's ever done to EROC by far this week.  Jack Tober was this week.  Colin Quinn called in this week.  We had Paul Williams and Meghan McCain in studio.  But before we get to that, Nick DiPaolo was in studio this week.  And I guess he had a rough time. 
[00:50:00]  Denny wouldn't leave him alone.  You know Denny.  Dennis Falcone, everybody's least favorite radio personality.  He was in studio along with Nick DiPaolo.  And we were talking about Spider Harrison and his terrible voice.  We were talking about some comedians that Nick DiPaolo likes.  Apparently.  But I couldn't find any of the right clips.  The right clips.  Quote unquote.  Nick DiPaolo had...  I think the only time Opie and Anthony have offered a do-over was for this appearance.  And it wasn't Nick's fault.  He's fucking hilarious. 
[00:50:30]  Nick DiPaolo.  On the Opie and Anthony Show.  The worst of the week countdown.  On the Opie and Anthony Channel.  Hey, who's the famous DJ on the 70s channel?  You know.  Oh.  At night.  Whose mic is way louder than it should be.  Somebody...  Who's that guy?  I have to get this in while I'm here.  Get Denny in here, please.  J.J. Walker?  J.J.  J.J. Walker.  No, J.J. something.  Oh, not...  It's J.J. Walker.  Is it? 
[00:51:00]  Yeah.  J.J. Walker.  J.J. Walker's a black guy.  Spider Harrison?  Yeah, no, but it's Spider Harrison under a different name.  It's Spider Harrison.  He calls himself J.J. Walker.  That bassy voice?  Yes.  But it's...  He calls himself J.J. Walker, but it's not...  It's Spider Harrison.  Why is he so loud when he comes on the mic?  Is he really loud?  It makes me fucking angry.  Spider Harrison.  J.J. Walker on the 70s.  Why'd it be J.J. Walker when that's Jimmy Walker?  That's what he calls himself, yeah.  When it's 6 p.m., right?  Tell him to turn down his goddamn mic.  Look what we do to people around here.  Danny used to be well-dressed. 
[00:51:30]  Now he just shuffles down the hall.  He's a bum now.  All disheveled.  Look at him.  He's 100 grams.  This guy loves radio, Nick.  Oh, he's a student at radio.  Danny.  Danny.  How you doing?  Dennis Falcone.  Nick has a question.  He's got a folder.  He's Schweppes.  Two pens.  Two pens.  Are you listening to Jacktober, by the way?  Yes.  Are you serious?  Hoodie?  Is this good shit?  It's the tried and true contest.  Those are the national contests.  I did them when I worked for Clear Channel.  They did the same things.  Everybody likes them.  Everybody does the same. 
[00:52:00]  Who likes them?  Nobody likes them.  You guys don't like it.  The DJs, we didn't like it because, you know, you'd get the winner and you could just say  and congratulations to Bob Taylor.  You couldn't say he was from, you know, Missouri.  I got a question for you, Dennis.  Are you dieting or dying?  I diet.  I diet.  What the fuck are you living on?  Dust?  What's that?  I did the South Beach diet.  The South Beach diet.  What are you doing?  A fucking eight ball in the morning and light in the sun?  Jesus Christ.  I don't eat the macaronis anymore.  The South Beach diet.  Even his diet is old fashioned.  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:52:30]  He's fucking a white.  You don't need to lose weight there, Dan.  Yeah.  No, a couple of years ago, I worked at a place and we got a bunch of those books for free.  So I took one and I read the diet and it worked well.  How much did you lose?  Of course, it was a free book.  I was about 20 pounds or so.  No, I mean, how many pounds?  Yeah, I went down from like a size 30.  I meant how many years on your career.  Oh.  Oh, you're teasing me.  You should probably gain back another eight.  Another eight.  I went down from like a size 30.  No, the skin's getting a little saggy.  That's not just from quitting pasta. 
[00:53:00]  Fucking please.  Eh?  AIDS?  There's no way.  Yeah, I think your ass is rotting out like a fucking tailpipe on a six-year-old bus.  Something that is wrong with me.  We need an example of what Nick was talking about on the 70s channel.  The guy's mic is too loud for Nick DiPaolo's taste.  Yeah, J.J. Walker there.  Tell him to fucking turn it down.  When he comes on, it's real loud.  It's hot.  Hot mic.  It's got a hot mic.  Hot mic.  I guess the fuck.  Yeah, but he's not saying anything important.  No, exactly.  So why does he have to be so loud?  He's loud.  But if you're not saying anything important... 
[00:53:30]  Do you notice that?  I mean, I turn it down in the car.  Wow.  Okay.  Is he a boss jock?  He's a boss jock.  Oh, yeah.  So you don't turn it up louder in stereo and rip off the knob.  Hey, how you doing?  He seems like he's hurting for attention.  I know he's been around forever, but...  Well, he's a good jock.  Yeah, he's a good jock.  Why does he have two names?  And why is he a good jock?  What means I'm a good jock?  He's got good pacing, good timing, good jokes.  He just sounds good.  There's no jokes.  He's the unfunniest thing I have ever heard in my life.  Here's Spider Harrison giving someone a shout-out. 
[00:54:00]  Keep in mind, he's Spider Harrison on Hits 1.  Right.  It's the same guy.  And he's J.J. Walker on the 70s.  He's got to change his name.  We're not making fun.  We're just observing.  It's an homage.  I'm a guest.  I can shit all over it.  Yeah.  I don't work for the motherfucker.  This guy?  Splatter with a Y.  I want to hear him on the 70s. 
[00:54:30]  I can't hear you.  That's not doing it justice.  He's terrible.  He's like on a Radio Shack color radio.  Yeah.  Coming through.  A little flavor radio.  You'll have, right?  Yeah.  He'll be playing music.  Then he'll be eight times louder than the music.  But we have celebrity guest host Flo Rader on for me.  Counting down the top 45 on Sirius XM Hits 1.  That's not it.  I'm just hanging out.  What's the camera?  That's not it.  This is all in his house.  What?  He doesn't even have to come to work?  He doesn't even have to come in.  He doesn't even have to come in?  He lives in Florida. 
[00:55:00]  He's got a studio.  Why the fuck do we have to come in?  I don't know.  A lot of guys don't come in.  They have the easiest radio job to begin with and they don't even have to fucking come in?  I don't understand why Sam is giving away all these secrets behind the curtain.  Oh, yeah.  Denny doesn't like this.  He doesn't like that.  Get the radio from anywhere.  That would rule.  I would sit on my couch and just fucking, yeah.  What?  That's my end goal.  That's be great.  But if you're a music jock, which is, let's be honest, no one gives a fuck about what  you're saying.  It's all computerized.  You're right.  At the very least, they should make you come in.  Show up.  To make it look like it might be a real job.  He sounds good, man.  I'd sell my soul for a voice like him. 
[00:55:30]  Oh, my God.  Why should I break the company, man, and I'll ruin this segment?  That's why we do it, actually.  Denny, you've got a great radio voice.  No, I don't.  No, you don't.  Greats on everyone.  See that?  I like that.  That old fucking...  Are you the fugitive?  Ding, ding, ding.  The fugitive is Denny.  Oh, wait, wait.  I have some.  Oh.  What do you might have?  Let's take a listen.  Got some sound?  What do you got?  The radio.  This is like the first time in my life I've ever had to grow to marry me, and she said,  I've had to grow to marry me, and she said, yeah.  This is Miss J.J. Walker's demo.  Yeah, I know. 
[00:56:00]  No, you just need to play him introducing a song like that.  Yeah, yeah.  It's all loud.  He just fucking makes...  It's annoyingly loud.  All right, so he's got a good voice.  Who gives a fuck?  No, it's what people liked back in the 70s.  I don't know if they ever liked it.  It was just there.  No, it was a hook by the industry, created by the industry.  Thank you.  It sounded good, though, but you have a very authoritative voice.  What would that mean?  It just sounded big.  If a guy was introing Freebird, but his voice wasn't like that, then you're not listening  to Freebird?  It didn't sound big.  It did not sound big. 
[00:56:30]  Who gives a fuck?  You still get to hear Freebird.  I got it now.  It was in a sports broadcasting booth.  Yeah.  Who gives a fuck who's in there?  I'm watching it because it's the Pats.  Do you want to listen to Denny Green doing an NFL game?  I won't listen to Denny Green doing anything.  Remember the coach of the Vikings?  I know who he is.  Yeah, another guy that did not have the strongest voice.  Who cares if they don't have the strongest voice?  He's still watching the game.  Hell, my boy.  But to listen to it for three hours, straight talking, it just gets a little good.  No, there's too many guys on the boat to begin with.  I need one guy. 
[00:57:00]  I need Keith Jackson.  Come on, Nellie.  Come on, Nellie.  I enjoy it.  How do you sum up a rivalry between Michigan and Ohio State?  Well, it's about not liking somebody since about 1939.  It's the best.  I go on one voiceover audition in L.A.  I'm coming out.  I'm coming into the building.  Who's coming out before me?  Oh, no.  Wow.  No kidding.  I went and I handed the script and a guy go, I'm not interested.  Yeah.  Is this one now?  He said, good luck, you little guinea. 
[00:57:30]  That's JJ?  Yeah, Y100 Miami.  Back in 1990.  What are you doing?  Picking every fucking show that I don't want to hear him on?  Go.  Hi, this is JJ Walker for South Park.  It's not doing it justice.  No, because he's not doing it justice.  Y100, you're watching Smash Hits with Scott Chavez.  No, he's on.  Play something from last night.  He's on every night on the 70s.  All right, he's got a good voice.  That's some voice.  Hey, you're listening to him.  But you know what?  You're listening.  I'm not listening.  Oh, boy.  I'm listening for the music, you motherless fuck.  I'm not listening for the DJ. 
[00:58:00]  That's the point we're trying to make today.  I don't listen to the music channels for the jock.  I want to hear Last Train of Clarksville.  I don't want to hear this.  What do you mean you do?  Why?  When I was a kid and we'd go on vacation somewhere, and the second the disc jockey would talk,  once the song would play, I'd change the channel for another DJ.  You'd see if I could find another station.  Wow, the DJ talking.  He is Mr. Radio.  You know, a jingle he's playing or something.  You are.  A contest or fun stuff like that.  Mr. Radio.  Were you gathered around the radio near the fireplace?  We used to love doing stuff like that.  Oh, it's the early 40s. 
[00:58:30]  What are you going to do?  Exactly.  I say that like I'm 30.  You've been getting them 51.  That station in Canada?  20 good years left.  Did you like them?  Maybe.  Did you like them?  I'm studying my own shits after I take them off.  I'm looking for blood.  You've got to see what's in there.  The other night, I'm like, oh, oh, it's Tabasco.  Jesus.  Any organs coming out?  Do you need?  Don't drink beet juice.  I would never die.  I would drink that.  That'll trick you every fucking time.  Beet juice.  No reason to eat.  It's the one food I don't like on the earth. 
[00:59:00]  It makes the entire...  No, I hate eating beets, but I'll put it in the juice.  It's easy.  It's easy in the juice.  We've got what Nick DePaulo requested.  Okay.  This J.J. Walker cat.  Intro.  When you're in the car, it's worse.  Oh, yeah.  It makes me jump. 
[00:59:30]  He's too loud, Dan.  Let's tell him.  Oh, there we go.  This is why I'm listening.  Saturday Night Fever.  I actually like the music.  That's where you change it, though, right, Dennis?  What's that?  That's where you change it.  I'll go to the 60s and see what they're doing there.  They're not doing anything at any of these places.  Stop going there to see what they're doing.  They might be stretching out the weekend like I do on Sunday night.  Got a great voice. 
[01:00:00]  You can't do that.  I just got to get a message to you.  Play more J.J.  Play more J.J.  You know, you could just go to a computer.  There's a bit going on here.  You could listen to all the voice tracks.  Him singing the Bee Gees.  Yeah.  For once in my life, I'm alone.  But you'd rather hear the guy with the voice.  How can I lose a devil?  How many is left? 
[01:00:30]  One?  I think there's just a bee.  The guy with the big teeth?  One Bee Gees.  He's still around, right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We got one bee.  Barry Gibb.  The guy that was like the handsome Bee Gees, right?  He's the last of the Bee Gees.  We lost all the Gs, and I think we're down to one bee.  No, we got one G left.  All the Bs are gone.  All the Bs are gone. 
[01:01:00]  It was the Brothers Gibb.  The Brothers Gibb.  Now there's just a Gibb.  Gotcha.  Was Joe Gibb part of the coach?  Joe Gibb?  The coach?  Yeah.  Was he one of the...  I'm not sure.  He's one of the Bs are gone. 
[01:01:30]  He's doing content.  Oh, he was.  Yeah, and he's doing it too loud as the...  What was the content?  I don't know.  Everybody was talking over it.  He was...  He was very upset.  We're talking over the content.  It's all computerized.  Content.  There's no content.  He sits in his house and tapes that shit.  Yeah.  And then they punch a button, right?  And they send it out.  No, no, no.  It takes like 20 minutes.  He's actually in the studio? 
[01:02:00]  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  No, he's...  I think the cat's out of the bag now.  He's going to have to keep up his front end of the zone.  Seven.  Time, cattle, cattle.  Time, time, time.  J.J. Walker remembering the bicentennial year.  See?  From coast to coast, the United States celebrating the 200th anniversary of the Declaration of  Independence.  Too loud.  Blah, blah, blah, blah.  It was also the year NASA released the famous Face on Mars photo taken by Viking 1 and the  year the Scottish Bay City Rollers invaded North America.  75.  476. 
[01:02:30]  And you like that, Dennis.  Yeah.  That was great.  You get to post everything.  Wait and see.  Wait and see.  Yeah.  There's ever since you've got a hold on me.  S-A-T-U-R.  It's crazy, but it's...  Oh, crazy is in this one.  S-A-T-U-R.  T-U-R.  What do you mean he gave you something?  He gave you something.  Talked about 1976.  We do that laundry list then hoping that it might spark some comedy.  You know what else?  He just gave you a laundry list of shit that happened in 76.  Who cares?  Because he's on the 70s channel and he was playing a song from 76. 
[01:03:00]  I know, but it comes up on the song place.  Right.  It tells you the year.  It comes up.  It takes all the guesswork right out of it.  Then you could just pick up your phone and go, 1976, you hit it, and you find out what  happened yourself.  So you don't really need a jock anymore because all that info is now on the radio.  I have another question about these channels, like the 80s and 70s.  How come on the 70s channel, it'll put the date of the song, but on, what is it, vinyl?  What's the other channel?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Like a fucking...  Classic Vinyl.  Classic Rewind.  Why does it not put the date?  They might play the album version, too, of the song, too. 
[01:03:30]  So where the 70s channel might be playing Do It Again by Steely Dan.  Oh.  Play the 70s, the single version.  And nobody knows when the album's put on what year.  And we care why.  I like it.  I do like a good date on there.  I do like a date on what year.  I do too.  I can listen and I go, I remember that.  But you don't need the jock giving you the year.  No.  If it says it on there.  Sometimes if you have to hit the post.  1976.  But Classic Vinyl doesn't tell you.  I don't like that.  If you've got music jocks, you should set them free and let them do their shit. 
[01:04:00]  I love that excited Denny gets about a year being blurted out before the music starts.  My point is, by the way, this was...  What was his name?  David Norton.  Yes.  He was an American Werewolf in London.  And he was the Dr. Pepper guy.  Yeah, what's his name?  Norton.  David Norton.  David Norton.  David Norton.  Yeah.  See, he had nothing there.  He was talking.  You guys talked all over.  A singer internet.  Well, I was trying to give some content.  I was talking about David Norton being the guy from American Werewolf in London and the Dr. Pepper guy. 
[01:04:30]  I'm a pepper, you're a pepper, remember him?  And he was the guy that sang, taking it, I'm jacking it, grabbing my cock and whacking it.  Werewolf in London.  What movie was the song?  No more smacking it.  Wasn't he the Werewolf in London guy?  Very good.  The Worst of the Week Countdown on the Opie and Anthony Channel.  The Worst of the Week Countdown continues.  Yes, indeed, it's the Worst of the Week Countdown where we highlight everything awesome that happened on the ONA show this week. 
[01:05:00]  I'm Sam Roberts, but you should know that by now.  I have a very distinct voice still to come on this year at Countdown.  I'm going to play for you the worst thing that Opie's ever done to E-Rock.  It happened this week, believe it or not.  Paul Williams and Meghan McCain both in studio.  Jack Tober rolling right along.  But first, I want to play Colin Quinn calling in.  We have Colin Quinn and Bobo. 
[01:05:30]  You all remember Bobo?  On the phone.  That was a collective groan I heard all at once.  On the phone at the same time, pitching to me what would be probably the most excellent web series that has ever existed.  It's Bobo and Colin Quinn, two comic geniuses, here on the Countdown.  Number five.  We've got a very special guest on our phone line, the great Colin Quinn.  Colin.  I like what Opie says. 
[01:06:00]  We have a very special guest.  I always make you laugh.  Yes.  Colin.  First, I was driving up to a gig last weekend.  There, I'm listening to the radio.  The show's on.  First, it says, which thank God my Twitter followers, I don't even notice.  Twitter people notice and point it out to me, so I get curious.  It says Bobo and Colin Quinn.  I have second bill to Bobo.  Now, that's bad enough.  Then, my name is misspelled. 
[01:06:30]  Oh, no.  That happens a lot.  How do they spell it?  Two L's.  Who's in charge of that, Sam?  That's either E-Rock or Sal.  No, I'm not in charge of it.  Sam, you're in charge of that, are you?  No.  Colin's saying you are.  Look, I host the show and do all the technical stuff.  There is a lot of misspelled.  In all honesty, though, E-Rock, of course, you just look at E-Rock and you know he can't  spell.  Yes. 
[01:07:00]  He just has that look of like a dumb speller, you know what I mean?  But they're constantly screwing up the spelling on that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It kind of ruined my fall a lot.  I remember my fun fall ride with Norton years ago with the same route, you know, and how  he made that into a nightmare for the stupid cynicism, you know?  And he has to stop at every service area.  Oh, I told you, that's the crowding point of my whole life is Norton screwed me a week 
[01:07:30]  before on a gig by not stopping at a rest area when I wanted to get to McDonald's or  Wendy's.  So I passed right by.  I pulled into the service area, like we're going to Starbucks, you know, you have to have  a stall, and then pulled right out onto the main road.  Good for you.  By the way, on my trip, I was listening to the Michael Shannon interview.  Yes.  He sounds like Stephen Wright.  You guys, yeah.  I give you guys credit.  You guys are the most forced, worst interviewers I've ever had. 
[01:08:00]  That was the worst interview I've ever had.  Because you're in the middle of doing what you love, busting bobos, busting people's balls,  harassing people.  And then a guest comes on, and you're sitting there with your hands folded like phony little  Catholic school kids, and trying to be nice and civil for 15 minutes, and hope they can  get out to you if that's what you love doing. 
[01:08:30]  You know what?  I'm so glad you bring this up.  He's right.  No, you're absolutely right.  We changed gears with some of these people.  Like, they're royalty, and it's like, fuck.  Well, it happened to you with the Mark Cuban.  Colin Quinn looks at me like, what are you guys doing?  This isn't your show?  Yeah.  And the whole audience is just waiting.  We're all sitting there waiting.  Okay.  I'll be gone soon.  Whoever the guest is, Mr. Serious Guy.  You know what I mean?  He's right.  Yeah, I don't.  The most infuriating part might be Norton, who pipes in with his little questions like 
[01:09:00]  he's a serious entity.  He really thinks he's Charlie Rose.  Oh, man.  I hate when Colin's right, but he's right.  I know.  There are so many times.  We've thought about this for years.  I don't really like having a lot of guests on this radio show.  No.  And you did it to him with Paul Anka, too.  What do you mean?  You left him on hold.  Well, you know, Paul Anka.  Yeah, then we, like, you know what?  We have Paul Anka in that day, and we panic because you're calling in. 
[01:09:30]  We're like, oh, my God, we can't possibly put these two together, even though that would  have been good.  Oh, my God.  No, you were right.  Your instinct was right.  It would have been horrible.  No, horrible in a good way.  Every show, yeah, the Paul Anka, I can't believe you guys are throwing that back in my face.  Sorry.  I think that's my fault.  I panicked.  I'm like, oh, my God, we've got to make sure we do a proper Paul Anka interview.  Yeah, that's what happens.  You know, we feel like we have to do a real interview. 
[01:10:00]  You guys decide to become professional for 15 minutes every show, and it's uncomfortable.  I personally hate it because, you know, our history, we used to beat the shit out of guests  to the point no guest would come on our show anymore.  That's true.  It was kind of like the Morton Downey Jr. thing, you know?  People weren't on to Morton Downey Jr. at first, and then when they were on to him,  he had to take all the shitty guests because no one in their right mind would go on that  show anymore, knowing everybody was against the person.  Right.  So then we had to, like, start being nice to guests, and now I think we're overly nice. 
[01:10:30]  But even they noticed there's an uncomfortable air.  They're going, what's going on here?  They see in the corner there's, like, some splattered chocolate.  There's, like, a half-naked hooker looming in the background, and you guys are like, so?  It's like going into a house where there's, like, a murder victim just happened.  They sit down and have a nice chat.  Yeah, we're going to have a chat before we get back to the botchery.  Yeah, there's a weird inability to transition really comfortably between those things. 
[01:11:00]  I don't know what to do with guests instead.  You know, you just fucking interview them.  I don't know.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Maybe you guys should do something like, you know, say, hey, we have some wacky times in  here, and just say, we're a little crazy thing.  It's not what you actors do, but you don't have any crazy times like that.  Yeah, that would be good.  I mean, you're right.  Other than the Barbara Walters of comedians going, so, you play a scary guy on the show. 
[01:11:30]  I've also, shut up.  Yeah, we are tools when it comes to that.  I don't know what to do.  What do you do?  But more importantly, are you guys in production, you know, riding around with Bobo?  Is this in production yet?  Oh, yeah, the show.  Yeah.  Yeah, he wants to have a surprise Thanksgiving.  We're going to burst.  We're going to burst in on him on Thanksgiving.  Right.  That's what he wanted.  Colin Quinn to burst in on him for Thanksgiving. 
[01:12:00]  What?  And then people suggest that we make that Anthony's house on that Anthony's house.  And I could shoot him, yeah.  Oh, I block him.  Home invasion.  That's what I missed on Twitter, because I blocked him again.  You block him.  I know.  That's what I missed, because that's kind of fun.  Dude.  He wants you to blow off your family or wherever you go for Thanksgiving.  Yeah.  To show.  Oh, my God.  To bust into his house.  So, of course, I retweeted and went, wow, Carl, this seems like a good idea.  It does. 
[01:12:30]  Just to get Bobo going, of course.  But it's true.  But he loved Anthony the most, obviously.  The lack of logic in these people.  It's amazing.  Bobo has his issues.  What are you going to do?  Yeah, but we've got a bunch of people like that.  I don't know what they listen to.  Well, if I burst in, it is his idea to burst in.  It's not really that much of a surprise.  Burst, you know?  No, no.  It's his idea, so it wouldn't surprise.  He'd be like, oh, it's Colin Burstigid. 
[01:13:00]  Right.  Yeah.  Although his mother and sister probably would get a little shaken up.  No.  The mom's a big Colin Quinn fan.  She'd be out of her mind happy.  Well, then she would be happy.  And then you've got Bobo on the barbecue, barbecuing up some stuff for the Thanksgiving meal.  It's beautiful.  Having two beers and getting hammered.  Huh?  It's beautiful.  He'd start throwing up on people's floors because he's had two beers. 
[01:13:30]  Right.  You're sitting there awkwardly as the dog's barking.  You know how happy I am?  Anthony didn't even get mad when Bobo had trouble.  It was so perfect.  How could I possibly get mad?  It was, you know, and it was on like a linoleum fake wood floor.  Easy clean up.  So I really didn't care.  Him yelling, I told you I wanted to pace myself, was hilarious.  He was drunk ten minutes into the party. 
[01:14:00]  Ten minutes in.  He almost drowned.  There's a video of him almost drowning in Anthony's pool.  Oh, when he jumped into my pool holding a hamburger.  He was holding a hamburger and jumped in my pool.  Fucking Bobo.  Never a dull moment with that motherfucker.  That's hilarious, guys.  Excuse me, now we have to break.  Hugh Jackman's coming back.  You didn't like our Hugh Jackman piece? 
[01:14:30]  I didn't see the Hugh Jackman.  That's a big A-lister.  Oh, it was a big one.  I was thinking of somebody that I thought would be, you know.  We got a couple pop culture things that came together that day.  You got the big Hugh Jackman, and then he's trying out a Cronut on our show.  It was amazing.  That was like the Today Show.  Yeah.  We could do that Today Show stuff.  Oh, it was fantastic.  It was terrific.  We asked him, you know, acting or singing, what was your first love?  Sure. 
[01:15:00]  I've been saying this for a while, man.  Yeah.  I have been saying this for a while.  I'm like, what's wrong with us?  None of these people want to be friends with us, so what are we doing?  Yeah, what are we doing?  It's hilarious.  You're like Cassie Leonidas.  How embarrassing.  That drivel.  Oh, man.  Why is that on TV?  Yeah.  I watched that shit at the gym just to be annoyed.  I know, me too.  You do, right?  It's so stupid.  It's the dumbest thing on TV. 
[01:15:30]  But it's the best because they're like, woo-hoo, yo, have another drink.  YOLO.  And even on other morning shows, I was like, hey, watch out.  You're going to be like, Cassie, hold on to that drink, and everyone's cackling.  Oh, Jesus.  Yeah, they think they're edgy because they've got a glass of wine on TV that they barely  touch, by the way.  Because I bet you someone gave Kathie Lee a talking to. 
[01:16:00]  Yeah, you think she was lushing it up too much?  I would imagine.  Look out.  Wild women.  She's still trying to get over that whole...  What, gift, gift, getting fucking the prostitute in the hotel room and trying to fuck her in  the ass on film?  Yeah, that was like the first setup of those things.  Yeah, that was like the first celebrity, like, I'm going to fucking set you up with it.  I'm going to fuck you over.  Yeah.  Oh, that was a good one.  She's on fucking Regis with her dumb kid and talking about this great life. 
[01:16:30]  And then there's GIF on the cover of the National Enquirer, the star, wanting to fuck a hooker  in the asshole.  Why that happened.  Don't you wonder why that was the first one?  Like, who got pissed off at who?  Right.  You know?  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, absolutely.  Because, I mean, they obviously could have done that to a thousand people over the past  20 years, but...  Yep.  Yeah, really, you know...  Uncover.  Just happened to the GIF.  Hey, did he hear from Squartz?  Did he find his fax machine?  I did not hear from him.  I thought after we talked about this on Friday that we would get the answer. 
[01:17:00]  Need a fax machine.  Anywhere in the Manchester area, I get a fax machine.  If I need it fast, I got to get some important stuff out.  There's a show there, man.  We got to get all these people together.  Just film them.  Like, don't you need a fax machine to be where you're faxing to?  Like, to...  Like, what?  Yeah.  If you have one fax machine in the whole world and Squartz has it...  They kind of work together, don't they?  Yeah, yeah.  Because then you should expect the fax back from that person with the answer. 
[01:17:30]  Yeah.  I think that's kind of a question-answer thing, the fax machine.  Oh, shit.  I got an important fax, but it was on that rolly paper, and it rolled up and rolled  under the counter.  Oh, my God.  Man, it's big.  Hey, you want to...  Should we bring back the retarded Laverne, Shirley?  Are we ready yet, Kyle?  Um, yeah.  It was fun last time we were in.  I think we're ready again.  Although, uh, Marion is very mad at us, because we recorded her saying the N-word. 
[01:18:00]  I remember.  Yes.  When she was doing the twerking.  She was twerking in the elevator.  But the husband called.  And she's like, yeah, that's right, my niggas.  She was all kinds of fucked up.  She said it.  Wasn't the black dude encouraging her to say it?  Yeah, of course.  He gave her a pass.  DJ, who kid?  Marion's got a ghetto pass.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She got the ghetto pass.  She has street cred.  But then the husband called us.  He was mad.  And they were like, well, let's talk to Marion.  But she went to work.  But it was obvious she was still there. 
[01:18:30]  Well, I think it's also, uh, you know, the times we live in, he's more outraged about  that than the fact that we were talking about, uh, certain, uh, you know, hygienic, uh, problems  that were happening that day, too.  Oh, God.  That's right.  Fucking lady died.  Well, we're looking at the video right now.  She's trying to throw up gang signs.  And she looks like one of those people afflicted with lobster claw hands.  Yeah.  She's so fucking, and she's got her, she's got her monkey's concert t-shirt on. 
[01:19:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  The Davy Jones Memorial.  It's the Davy Jones Memorial concert t-shirt.  Cause the band went on without Davy.  Of course.  It was a, it was a discharge.  What a dick move to, to do.  Well, yeah, I, I had a discharge.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'll tell you the truth.  It's also a dick move.  The first time I came out, I came on with them.  They were hardcore parrot heads.  Right.  Uh-huh.  Obviously they've switched to the monkeys.  Yes.  Yes.  They're all about the monkeys. 
[01:19:30]  And she's, he's all the love he can get.  And she's proud that she knows a lot of his songs.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Davy Jones.  I mean.  Yeah.  I think I got my friend.  Oh, that was so disgusting.  She got her, her last period on our show, right?  No, I think she fucking had an orgasm.  I think Colin was right.  That turned out just to be a discharge.  She came on our show.  Yeah.  I think she was so excited.  I thought she was having a.  For so many years, you know.  Yeah.  She was squirming and, you know. 
[01:20:00]  Yeah.  The pants are rubbing.  Oh, my God.  Before you know it.  You feel a little.  Bring back Hugh Jackman.  I'm sure there's a pastry we can talk about.  Oh.  So, Hugh, during Les Mis, when you were filming Les Mis, now, I'm fascinated that you all sang  your own lines in that.  What was that like?  I kind of hate Colin's honesty.  Oh, I know.  I'm going to keep your honesty to yourself.  It hurts too much.  How do you go between a movie like Prestige and a movie like Wolverine seamlessly? 
[01:20:30]  Yeah.  Literally, during, and I'm sure I'm speaking for a lot of listeners, during the Michael  Shannon interview, I wanted to drive right off, right into another.  I mean, it was a good interview.  He wasn't a bundle of energy.  No, it was a horrible interview.  Oh, okay.  I had a different angle on it.  I'm like, no, it was a good interview, but it just doesn't belong on the show.  No.  But you're saying it's just a bad interview, and it still doesn't belong on the show. 
[01:21:00]  It was like a first date.  You guys would have said, yeah, that didn't work out.  We just didn't click.  Yeah.  We say yes to a lot of guests, because Jimmy wants to get those pictures taken.  I feel like we're being held hostage.  Yeah, and the worst part is Jim thinks, because he watches Boardwalk Empire, he's going to  have the insightful questions, but instead, the night before he does it, set up the cellar,  he runs home, falls asleep too quickly, and wakes up, and comes up with an awful question. 
[01:21:30]  So in his mind, he really preps, because he watches the show.  Right, right.  But he doesn't do the prep of thinking, like, hey, what would be an interesting angle question?  He has a question that he thinks, in his mind, is interesting, but it's not.  Unprepared horse shit.  Unprepared.  I'm scared that Colin's consulting our show right now.  Unprepared horse shit. 
[01:22:00]  Bullshit.  He swells his chin.  You can just see him on the show.  On episode two, there was a...  The guy just looks at him like, oh, shut up, fanboy.  I don't care.  He really does.  What are you going to do?  Yeah.  Unprepared by watching the show.  I'll give him that.  All right.  Yes.  He doesn't sit down and go, what would be the angle on this, you know?  Was Providence good to you there, Colin? 
[01:22:30]  What's that now?  Was Providence good to you?  Oh, it was fantastic.  Yeah.  It was great, guys.  It was great, guys.  Liked it?  Yeah, it was great.  Where's the next stop on the big tour?  Oh, next stop, we're talking about Ridgefield, Connecticut.  Okay.  Then we're going to the Soap Pack, Jersey, of course, and then the Virginia, North Carolina.  I'm hitting all the 13th colony tour, guys.  Yes.  You got to hit them all. 
[01:23:00]  You got to hit them all, right?  Yes.  Yes.  And I told you the big joke about Rhode Island was how they weren't even at the convention,  so we had a good laugh over that one.  We're 13.  We're about 14 hours away from shutdown.  Yeah.  From the government shutdown.  Oh, that's right.  It's perfect for my show.  Yeah, yeah.  It kind of is.  It's a good tie-in.  Oh, man.  I don't know what's going to happen in 14 hours.  What happens?  They have a countdown clock.  Like, when it reaches zero, something's going to happen, right? 
[01:23:30]  You can't get your passport.  Oh.  Yeah.  What else?  Just a couple of things.  Oh, so you're not going to be able to do, like, some government-related things.  Some of them, right.  Some, but I mean, you know, the Air Force is still going to be flying.  And if you've got the government job, you don't get paid.  What about the post office?  Delivering mail?  I think they...  Yeah, they go to the mail.  All right.  So what the fuck is the big deal?  Oh, gee. 
[01:24:00]  I don't get it.  How about we just have a shutdown?  That means everything's shut down.  But if there's a clock...  They have special rules.  When you have a countdown clock, I'm seeing it on Fox, on CNN, they're all counting down.  There's a clock on the screen constantly.  Wouldn't you think that when it reaches zero, something happens that is this big thing?  Devastating.  Well, like, you know, like, I mean, a lot of people don't go to work as far as in, you know, like about, I think like 500,000 people don't work. 
[01:24:30]  All right.  Okay.  And who's going to do the fun part of the countdown?  You know, the 10-9-8 thing.  Oh, yeah.  Will they have some special person doing that?  It could.  Yeah, probably.  It can't be Dick Clark.  Yeah, unfortunately not.  Dick Clark.  Scorch.  I'm starting to think that CNN is pushing some fear forward here with the countdown clock.  That's what I'm thinking.  It's a little fear right there.  Shutdown countdown.  13 hours, 55 minutes to the shutdown.  I don't know.  Oh, that's what it is?  It's a countdown?  Yeah, there's an actual countdown. 
[01:25:00]  It's smart.  That's what it keeps people watching.  Are you kidding me?  We'll be talking with Harry Reid, uh, seeing upcoming, uh, wouldn't that be great?  We'll do an interview.  So, uh, the shutdown, sir.  Now, all I'm thinking about is our interviews.  Well, you know what?  Well, if you guys had political people on, it would actually work fine.  Well, we had Rumsfeld on.  Ant was, uh, going for the real interview.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Because he's a big fan of the Rumsfeld.  And Louis C.K.  And Louis C.K. was asking him, uh, if he's a lizard or not.  Right, right, right.  That was a classic moment on the show.  Yeah.  Yeah, the politicians. 
[01:25:30]  So you're saying more of that type of thing.  More politicians.  The politicians on, yeah.  Yeah, okay.  But it's the fluff actor bullshit that Colin does not think works well on this program.  Right.  Well, I think Opie got to the root problem.  Norton wants autographs.  We feel guilty.  We're like, oh, if we say no, he's not going to get the big picture.  Yeah.  Norton wants a picture.  That's all it is.  I am so scared the next time we've got to interview anyone now.  Oh, no.  You're going to be in the back of my head.  You're going to be in the back of my head. 
[01:26:00]  Oh, no.  I know.  You're going to be out there somewhere, which is creepy, counting on us to just blow it up.  No, not even blow it up.  Just, I mean, the stupid dialogue.  Oh, he's right.  I don't know what happened.  I hear you.  And everybody politely waits.  Each one of you politely waits for the next guy before you ask your next question.  Yes.  And then if you step on somebody, you're like, oh, I'm sorry.  I'm sorry. 
[01:26:30]  I'm sorry.  What?  You were saying?  Ask your bit of importantness here.  Shit, he's right.  Fuck you, Colin.  I'm getting out of here.  Yeah, I guess.  I'll see you later.  All right, Carl.  Thanks.  Thanks for nothing.  I am Colin Quinn on Twitter.  Lord Lord, the O.P. and Anthony Warrens to the week.  Contact for UDNX.

It's me, Sam Roberts, highlighting everything great that happened on the Opie and Anthony 
[01:31:00]  show this week with the worst of the week countdown.  Now, still to come, Meghan McCain in studio, Paul Williams in studio, and Opie doing the  single worst thing he's ever done to E-Rock.  And he's done a lot to that poor guy.  However, before we get to that, of course, October means Jocktober.  You all remember what Jocktober is, don't you?  It's where we highlight a different radio show every day for the month of October.  It's always a random radio show that I just find, listen to, bring clips in, and for no 
[01:31:30]  reason we just let that show know how horrible they are.  And Scott and Todd was not an exception.  No, comedian Dan Soder was in studio with us.  He's an old radio guy, too, so he knows all these tricks.  Scott and Todd was a part of this week's Jocktober, and I wanted to share that with you  right now.  All right, a little Jocktober, ladies and gentlemen.  It's Jocktober. 
[01:32:00]  A celebration of all things shitty in radio.  That's not very nice.  That's not very nice.  Fantastic failures of pontificating proportions.  That's so bad.  Wow.  An interactive exploration of what makes radio rancid.  Jocktober.  One FB.  Host.  Host.  And Stunt Boys.  This isn't funny.  It's time for Jocktober.  I got a tree on my house.  All right.  And remember, we said we want to change it up a little bit this year, make it a little 
[01:32:30]  different.  Yeah.  We have decided that this particular show needs way more than one day.  Of course.  Way more than one day.  Yes.  So, for this year's Jocktober, Fridays are dedicated to Scott and Todd.  Scott and Todd.  Good morning show.  Friday is Scott and Todd day.  I got a tree on my house.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Scott and Todd.  Scott and Todd. 
[01:33:00]  They've been a staple in New York City radio for many, many years.  Uh-huh.  I personally don't understand why, but for some reason, they have enough of an audience  that they continue to fucking broadcast.  Amazing.  Just looking at their picture, they have WNBA coach faces.  Yeah.  They look like they're like, ladies, hustle it up.  Come on, girls.  Come on, girls.  Hustle it up.  Another layup.  Scott and Todd.  Scott and Todd.  Scott Shannon should be a reminder that you should not...  What happened there?  Oh. 
[01:33:30]  Is it possible?  What happened to the Facebook page?  What a fucking drag.  Pre-emptive?  Uh-oh.  Pre-emptive?  It's possible.  Let me...  What did they know?  We got a pre-emptive strike here?  I bet E-Rock tipped them off.  He's working for Scott and Todd.  Yeah.  He's like, hey, by the way, fuck them guys.  They're going to fuck you today.  It was all the dirt.  Shut down your Facebook.  I think we kind of...  I think we talked about Friday's being Scott and Todd day before today, so I think they're  on to us.  Oh.  No, here you go.  Oh.  Oh, okay.  Hey, there we go.  Scott and Todd from PLJ. 
[01:34:00]  PLJ here in New York City.  PLJ's Facebook page?  Scott Shannon, in all fairness, did a lot of cool things for radio, but he probably should  have stepped out a few years ago.  Oh, boy.  The overstated his welcome.  Yeah.  It's a reminder that maybe there's a time for all of us to just step aside.  Is it that he's just trying too hard now, or...?  No, he's just...  He's not trying at all.  Yeah.  At all.  He has a rock mouth.  That's fair enough.  He looks like a fucking rock, and he sounds like one. 
[01:34:30]  He's saying he's a rock-headed idiot?  He's a rock-headed idiot.  He has Easter Island head.  Those fucking monoliths.  And I don't know.  It looks like he's had some work done over the years to the point he might have fucked  up his own...  He kept...  He went to the well too many times?  I think so, yes.  Yes.  Most of his face doesn't move.  There's nothing better than a guy with too much facial plastic surgery.  Oh, yeah.  And he really doesn't say much on the radio anymore of importance.  Oh, man.  No.  He looks like...  And then his partner, Frost's hair. 
[01:35:00]  I'm kind of stuck a lot.  Yeah, yeah.  He looks like a senator that tried to kill Steven Seagal, or set up Steven Seagal.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  He's just like, I know you're a good cop, but I don't care.  Oh, man.  Yeah.  Yeah, he could have a rolling machete.  Yeah.  What do we got from Scott and Todd?  Well, I figure, you know, there are a couple staples.  I hope he's checking his phone.  Update?  No update.  Oh, boy.  So we're going to stick with Still Furious. 
[01:35:30]  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Yeah.  No, he actually mellowed out.  Actually took a log flume ride.  Oh, yeah.  He's like, you know what, guys?  After I got splashed on Splash Mountain, I realized it's not that big of a deal.  It's not that bad anymore.  It's having fun.  Yeah.  I'm going to go get a Bing phone.  Happiest place on Earth.  Yeah.  I got a text from Eric.  What does it say?  I'm not mad.  Oh, great.  April Files.  Oh, Edgar.  April Files. 
[01:36:00]  Don't even...  No timing.  It doesn't even wait for it.  It's fucking terrible.  Settle in.  It's not April.  All right.  So it's Scott and Todd Day.  Every Friday, we're doing Scott and Todd Fuck It for Jocktober this year.  And today, we start with a fine song parody.  They love...  Oh, do they love their song parodies?  They love the song parodies.  They love a good parody.  But if you notice, one thing I love about their song parodies is how they shoehorn words in  by just completely putting the accent on the wrong syllable. 
[01:36:30]  They put words in that are much more wordy than the original song.  They have to bend and twist the line.  Like, a good parody, the words naturally fit in.  And you sing it, and it sounds like the original song.  They're incapable of doing those.  Yeah, so they really try for their song parodies.  Oh, yeah.  Well, yeah.  I mean, the energy's there, sir.  Oh, God.  What is this one about?  Is it topical?  Not really.  I mean, the great thing about Scott and Todd...  Yeah.  It doesn't have to be topical.  We've been doing Jacktober for six years, I think.  Wow. 
[01:37:00]  It's either the sixth or seventh year.  It's the exact same show.  Yeah.  I mean, for all these years that I've been listening to them, their show hasn't changed  even slightly.  Wow.  So the song parody is still indeed a staple.  Yeah.  No, I think this one...  Sometimes they'll do a topical one, but since the show hasn't changed in so long, sometimes  I think they can also go back into the archives and pull one out.  Oh, God.  Getting ready to laugh. 
[01:37:30]  I need them by the sack.  Uh-huh.  But when their meat's unlocked and zips, they quack. 
[01:38:00]  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Ducks.  Check it to the chorus.  Is it beef or I might be allowed?  Is it beef?  Hey, Jen, I'm black.  Is it beef or I might be allowed?  Is it beef or I might be allowed?  Terrible.  This is fucking hilarious.  I can't even fucking deal.  Yep.  This is on New York radio.  They think that's going to be...  The number one market in the country.  Asshole.  That's like, this is good.  It's good.  I got a parody about taco meat.  You guys are not going to believe the new one.  It is taco meat parody.  You know how they were talking about, like, what's in that taco meat? 
[01:38:30]  No.  Didn't hear that.  Well, I read the story.  No one else knows it.  So, let's make a song about it.  Obscure news stories turned into parody songs?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Did you guys hear about the traffic on the upper level of the Queensborough Bridge?  We did a parody song about it.  A car broke down.  And I'm not trying to get around.  Fucking stretching.  Yeah.  Around.  Anything.  Oh, my God.  Take it to the bridge.  Because they say that in the song.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[01:39:00]  Because they really do say that in the song.  Flattentastic.  Is it beef from R.J.T.  Is it beef or kangaroo skin?  Is it beef or is it penguin?  Is it beef or wild wombat?  Is it beef or rabbit?  Yeah.  What's in that taco meat?  Yeah.  Is it full of little chihuahua meat?  Yeah.  Another repeat.  Same.  Made from rodents in the street.  Same fucking line.  Do they just slap some sauce on it and he?  Yeah. 
[01:39:30]  Take it to the bridge.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Chalupas are such a delicious snack.  They're doing the same thing.  That's how lazy this is.  Right.  They're doing just the shitty verse again.  When their beats alive does it say quack.  Fucking funny.  Do you like it, Chef?  It's clean yoga.  It's clean.  It's clean.  Is it beef or a slight hyena?  Is it beef from Argentina?  Is it beef or kangaroos?  Are there hyenas in Argentina?  I don't think so. 
[01:40:00]  Is it beef or wild wombat?  Is it beef or rabbit bobcat?  Oh, fucking good stuff.  I am good stuff.  Wow.  Fun song.  Fun song.  Fuck yeah.  Perfect example again of Jocktober.  Song parodies.  99.9% of them suck ass.  They are terrible.  What upsets me the most is thinking of the person that enjoys this.  Well, there was a time they were, you know, maybe not on that show, I don't know, but in  general, you know, you'd appreciate a good song parody. 
[01:40:30]  Hey, I used to write a few myself.  I think that time has passed us.  Back in the day.  Scott and Todd being featured on Jocktober today.  Look at his frosted hair.  Is Todd...  He enjoys a good frosting.  Is Todd gay?  Not that I know of.  Oh, okay.  I'm just wondering.  He just plays one in his pictures.  He looks like a gay man.  Which is fine.  Right.  Not that there's anything wrong with that.  I am just selling some real estate in Vermont. 
[01:41:00]  Yes.  The frosted hair, the turtleneck sweater.  He likes to perform.  He likes to do...  What is that?  The burgundy color?  Yeah.  I just have to curl up with some chamomile.  I use an exfulgating wash.  Hi, guys.  Welcome back to the program.  Burgundy's a rough color for fucking anyone.  Oh, is he trying to be a hipster with those glasses?  Well, you know what?  I wear, I wear, I wear.  You make fun.  That's the look.  I wear, I wear, I wear.  Yeah, we don't...  When was the last time we wore a suit to work?  These guys wear suits to work.  Ugh.  Anyway, we move on with some classic Scott and Todd banter as the boys talk about Carrie 
[01:41:30]  Underwood singing the Beatles.  And Scott contributes...  Oh.  Nothing.  Oh, damn.  I thought he contributed something.  I thought he was going to step in.  Oh, man.  There's a theme with today's Jocktober.  Uh-huh.  You're going to hear a theme.  I think we picked up on it.  Okay.  It was sort of shaky, and then some people said stuff like, I'll never forget where I  was when JFK was shot, and I'll never forget where I was when Carrie Underwood murdered 
[01:42:00]  the Beatles.  She got the most tweets.  17,090 during the show.  Elton John was second with 13,720.  Is this a fun song?  Those were a lot of hate tweets, though.  That's all right.  Doesn't matter.  I guess.  It's still tweets.  I didn't think it was that terrible.  No, I didn't either.  I mean...  She's a nice lady.  She's not...  That's not an easy song to sing.  Who gives a shit if she's a nice lady?  I mean, it's a classic, and I guess a lot of the, you know, the guys or girls on Twitter  might be...  Well, they probably never even heard it.  Right.  You know?  Like, who did this?  One Direction? 
[01:42:30]  This dirt.  This one of them One Direction songs.  I hate One Direction.  I hate One Direction.  Wow.  It's good stuff.  I hate One Direction.  It's good stuff.  Him and Todd quite obviously hate each other.  There's no chemistry there whatsoever.  Because Todd just plows over him.  Yeah.  He doesn't listen to him.  She seems like a nice lady.  A nice lady.  Thank you, nice lady.  Nice ass.  I think a lot of it is Scott trying to tag everything Todd does. 
[01:43:00]  Yeah.  With nothing.  With nothing, yes.  He tags with nothing.  With stony silence.  Or the last thing where he's going like, he's doing this One Direction bit, and then Scott  for no reason goes, I hate One Direction.  I hate One Direction.  I hate One Direction.  You didn't say it right.  I hate One Direction.  It bothers me because it's me.  Yeah, I agree wholeheartedly.  I hate them.  Days are getting married.  Days are getting married.  I don't like.  My daughter's dating a black guy. 
[01:43:30]  I don't like One Direction.  One Direction.  I don't like One Direction.  Oh, he's great.  What do you hate One Direction for?  I don't like One Direction.  He just blurted it out.  I hate them.  They woke him up from a nap.  Yeah.  It's a taco One Direction.  I hear more coherent stuff walking by an old age home here in New York City.  That's what we're listening to.  Exactly.  We've got someone who wants to comment on the taco meat song.  Don't forget it's taco day on the Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:44:00]  Oh, I bet it is.  Get ready to enjoy us eating tacos.  Brian from Impractical Jokers.  Hey, guys.  They call me Q on Impractical Jokers.  Yeah.  What are you guys doing?  I actually like the show, and I heard you were a fan of ours, which I think is pretty  cool, man.  What do you got, Brian?  I'm a huge fan, man.  I just got satellite.  I just bought a new car, and I just got satellite radio in it, and I was so excited to listen to  you guys.  And I didn't get, like, I turned it on, and it was like a glorious moment. 
[01:44:30]  I was like, I'm back.  This is great.  And I didn't know you guys were doing a joke.  I just heard you guys say, get ready to laugh, and then play the taco meat song.  Oh, no.  You thought that was us?  I was like, what have you been doing while I've been gone?  What's been going on?  Oh, no.  I just imagined Opie with a bunch of plastic surgery on his face.  Yeah.  One direction.  One direction.  That's a funny taco meat song.  Man, it's great.  She's a nice lady.  She's a nice lady. 
[01:45:00]  Ah, not bad.  You get Carrie Underwood, who's like a young, good-looking girl.  Yeah, yeah.  And your description of her, she's a nice lady.  She's a foxy lady.  That's not strong.  I mean, just states facts.  She's like, that's not strong.  Man.  Thank you, worthless.  Hey, Brian, you've got to come in and do our show, man.  I would love to.  You tell me how and when, and I'm there.  Yeah, we'll figure it out.  My in-laws turned me on to Impractical Jokers.  You've got them to thank, and I absolutely like it.  Where are we at with the show? 
[01:45:30]  I don't even know.  I'm a little behind.  We're on a new episode start the 24th of October, and we are shooting the third season now.  So we're just going to go.  We've got like 30 more episodes to shoot.  All right.  You guys are.  I'm thinking guest spot for myself.  I'm thinking the same thing, but I'm right in.  Just put him on the spot.  Yeah.  I'm thinking guest spot.  What do you think?  Yeah.  Sounds like you're building new friendships.  I can pull a joke or two every once in a while. 
[01:46:00]  Let me tell you.  I can make that happen.  I have that power.  I would love to be on that show, all kidding aside.  All right.  Hold on the line.  We're going to get your number, because you should absolutely come in to promote the new season.  I live on Stam Island, man.  I can be there every day.  Well.  We've got to get back to Jack Tover, so hold on the line.  Thank you, Brian.  He's a nice lady.  We're featuring Scott and Todd, which we're going to do every fucking Friday for the month of Jack Tover. 
[01:46:30]  Well, we've got Scott here getting topical.  Oh, that's always good.  He's good.  I mean, you guys are making fun of him for saying he hates One Direction, but he knows what's going on.  He gets it.  He gets it.  He's probably on the Twitter.  Oh, yeah, he is.  Oh, nice.  Listen to him getting topical.  I don't have to Google.  I use CompuServe.  DOS Prom.  Anyone got a new AOL disc?  I like playing the Tetris. 
[01:47:00]  That's what I play.  It soothes my brain.  We got any faxes?  How about that?  That's paper.  Where's the afternoon paper coming out?  I want to read the daily.  Oh, fuck.  James, uh...  Crumwell.  Crumwell, thank you.  He's been around forever.  He was in a movie.  Remember that movie?  He's been in a hundred movies.  Remember that movie he was in about...  Babe, Pig in the City?  Yeah, the pig.  The pig movie.  Didn't you see that?  I don't think that you want to bring that up on a day you just won an Emmy. 
[01:47:30]  Oh, my God.  It's Scott okay.  It's Scott okay.  I don't think so.  I think this is not...  The pig movie.  The pig movie.  Yeah, when he came out his number on the radio.  His vacation was ruined.  Everyone's calling his home.  They're probably calling his house.  You're like, no, it's his cell phone.  Babe, Pig at Disney.  The name of the movie.  But they all quickly try to finish his fucking sentence so they can move on. 
[01:48:00]  They close it.  They shut him down.  They try to shut him down.  Hey, Perk!  Perk was in that movie.  He was in a thousand movies.  Shut up, you doddering old fool.  He wined a lot of them, you stroke fake rockhead of nothing.  Shut up!  He really is.  He's like the last years of Strom Thurmond, where they keep trying to cut him off before  he says anything.  Cut him off.  Don't say something stupid.  They should hire the angel of death to just be in the studio to keep him quiet.  Just sitting there looking at him, waving his finger.  No, no. 
[01:48:30]  The angel of death with the...  Shipping the sickle?  Yeah, yeah.  Sickle at him.  The angel of death with a pillow just ready to go.  It's the pig movie.  The pig movie.  What was that?  Well, who doesn't eat pigs of those Muslims?  What?  That'd be cool if he just didn't even know.  Oh, he just loses his mind.  Yeah, the Jews ought to fire pigs over the wall at them muzzies.  That's the real fight.  That's it.  Don't get me started on the coloreds. 
[01:49:00]  Nigga.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  So I barely eat.  So I barely eat.  Ah.  The drum.  There's a spook on my block.  I don't like these China men yelling at me.  They're trying to drive with chinks on the road.  It's impossible, those bastards.  I get in a cab and the guy just smells like curry.  Yeah.  Fair, fair, fair.  What direction? 
[01:49:30]  Oh, boy.  I'm going to love Fridays.  Got it right here.  That nice lady, though.  I like that nice lady from the pig movie.  Pink movie.  Touch her face.  Did he say nice lady?  Yeah.  I did.  Carrie Underwood.  Carrie Underwood.  She's a nice lady.  She's a nice lady.  She's trying to saw.  That's great.  All right, guys.  So.  What else?  I love this.  Well, you got Todd.  Mm-hmm.  The one that likes a good frosting.  Oh.  Yeah.  He's telling a DMV story.  Boy, that's topical. 
[01:50:00]  Okay.  People can relate.  Very relatable.  And he puts Scott, I like how Sam wrote this out, and his comments on the Pay No Mind list.  Oh, but no.  He won't let him talk.  Fuck no.  He knows.  And never feeds him anything to get his opinion and tries to shut him down.  Wait till you.  Scott jumps in a couple times.  Oh, God.  And Todd places him directly on the Pay No Mind list.  Directly.  I love it.  Not subtle at all, huh?  No.  I mean, a one-way ticket to the Pay No Mind list. 
[01:50:30]  You know, sometimes when we do Jacktober, I see the track list, and I go, oh, fuck, we  got to do four more.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  I'm feeling sad here that we don't have, like, twice as many clips today.  That's right.  We celebrate every Friday.  I love it.  I am so sad.  This relationship between Todd and Scott really is just making me, it's just great.  It's magic.  It's like a son who hates his father, but his father won't die.  It's just like, yeah, Dad, we know it. 
[01:51:00]  Okay.  Right.  You're embarrassing me.  They've been together forever, because my friend, and he is my friend in the end, Jim Chandler,  yeah, but he rocks your friend, too.  Oh, boy, and look at what you did to him.  Jim Chandler works.  Friends like him.  Who needs enemies, right?  Oh, yeah.  Ship up.  Got ship all around.  Jim Chandler worked with Todd up in Albany at the Fly, and they were doing very well together,  and Todd decided to take the big gig in New York with Scott. 
[01:51:30]  Yeah, because that frosting ain't going to pay for itself.  No.  That's right.  You've got to get that frouse money.  I wish we could fucking put, like, little frost pellets in a shotgun.  Can we use that?  It's a new applicator.  Yeah.  You frost from the inside of the throat.  Fuck and die.  Fuck.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's get back to this.  DMV story, and Scott and his comments are put on the Pay No Mind list.  I had quite a day yesterday.  Really?  Yeah.  I had to go to DMV.  Oh, no.  Oh, no. 
[01:52:00]  And the lady who usually helped me over there retired.  So guess what is on my own?  You had to go in there like a regular New Jerseyan?  Mm.  I don't know.  The people I saw in there, I never saw in New Jersey.  I felt like somebody should have been playing a steel drum offering me a little plastic cup of punch.  So basically, you were riding in steerage.  How long was your day there?  Oh, wow.  What does that mean?  About an hour and 45.  Nothing. 
[01:52:30]  Riding in steerage?  Steering?  Is that a plane?  They hate minorities.  Oh, they certainly do.  You can tell from their brakes.  Yeah.  You know what?  What happened?  They fired a jigger bull who used to help you?  All right.  Keep in steerage.  I'd probably put her out in the field.  What happened to the woman that used to help you?  She was a nice lady.  She used to make fun of Scott's voice, but what about Todd's voice?  What's he doing?  What's he doing?  The worst is yet to come. 
[01:53:00]  More of the Opie and Anthony worst of the week countdown.  Next.  There he is.  That's he.  That's it now.  Hitchy, hitchy, splatter.  My arms fight, what ist it?  Scream.  Scream.

Yes, yes, yes, still to come on this here Worst of the Week Countdown, highlighting the great moments in Opie and Anthony this week.  Meghan McCain was in studio, and Opie did the worst thing he's ever done to E-Rock.  You've got to listen to that, but before we get to any of it, Paul Williams was in studio.  You know Paul Williams? He's a 70s music icon. 
[01:58:00]  Opie cold-called him before he came in.  We had a keyboard set up.  We wanted him to perform and sing and play, and it was going to be great.  We didn't really do our homework too well on him, but that's okay.  He came in anyway, and I guarantee, after this appearance, you will not stop walking around your house singing Paul Williams as Anthony Cumia, if you know what I'm saying.  Here he is, Paul Williams on the show.  We've got Paul Williams coming in, and the keyboard is set up, so. 
[01:58:30]  Cool.  I hope he plays.  What do you mean?  Did he say he was going to?  I don't give a fuck what he says.  Yeah.  But you could call him right now and say, I know you're coming in.  Oh, no.  In an hour and a half, but we want you to play.  Oh, no.  Just be prepared.  It's not a bad idea, Sam Roberts.  Just cold call him.  I hope he's...  Not a bad idea.  Oh, no.  I don't know why I still haven't put him in my phone.  He's not in your phone?  No, it's still on this dumb card. 
[01:59:00]  It's kind of the fun of it.  I don't know why I didn't put him in my phone.  My, my, my.  I'm one spitting twice, eh?  And then if he doesn't pick up, leave him a voicemail.  It says, hey.  See, if you tell him now, he's got a reason to go to camp.  If it's just there, he wants to tell him.  No, I'm going to tell him.  You don't ask.  You tell him.  Right, just so you know.  That sounded like that long ring before a message picks up.  Really?  Morning.  Paul Williams. 
[01:59:30]  This is me.  Opie and Anthony.  How are you?  Hi, Mr. Williams.  I'm going to see you guys in about, what, an hour, I think, huh?  Yes.  And we got a request, so we want you to be prepared for it.  Okay.  This is very considerate of you.  What happened, you guys?  What happened?  We, uh, we got, we got a keyboard set up in the studio, sir.  We want to just sing for an hour.  Well, here's the only problem is that I don't play piano. 
[02:00:00]  You don't?  Oh, see.  I write on it.  I sit there and I'll follow, search for chords and write on it, you know.  But that's why I spend all that money taking a band on the road with me.  Wow.  If I can play, I can't play.  Oh, shit.  That's amazing.  I feel like, I mean, I can probably stumble up and find the chords to old-fashioned love  song, and that's literally about it.  I have, you know, everything that I write, I write it in my head.  I go to the chord, to the piano, I find the chords, write them down, go into this video, 
[02:00:30]  give the chords to the musician, they play it, and then I'm done and move on to the next  song.  That's pretty, just because you can train a horse doesn't mean you can write it, you know.  That's amazing.  That's pretty amazing, sir.  I would still love to hear you stumble through old-fashioned love songs.  Yeah, now it makes it even better that you can't play the piano.  We're really going to have a good time.  Can we say that again?  I said, it makes it better that you can't play the piano. 
[02:01:00]  We'll really have a good time now.  Oh, it's absolutely perfect, you know.  It's like a chance, you know, like, what better chance than, you know, like, to be absolutely  all Thumbs Williams, you know.  And those bad notes, you know, floating around the world.  We'll work it out this morning, but yeah, I don't play the piano.  All right, we'll harmonize some shit.  We'll do some acapella.  Why not?  Exactly.  Acapella is us.  We can do some church choir stuff.  All right, we'll do it, man.  We're looking for...  Who's the other love boat?  I tweeted about it the other day that I said, I want to get back in there and hear Opie 
[02:01:30]  go in there and do the love boat.  The love boat.  Who was that imitating me?  Was that you, Opie?  No, that was Anthony.  Anthony does a great impression of you.  I give you credit for...  Anthony, you do a pretty good Paul Williams impression.  I've been doing a Paul Williams impression for my family and whatnot for probably 40 years.  Looking back when I sounded like the D after D...  I love that.  The love...  So what we're going to do this morning is have the old Paul Williams interview the new Paul Williams, 
[02:02:00]  and I can tell the old Paul Williams what a total fuck-up he was.  I like it.  I do, too.  You know, hey, listen, it's cutting-edge radio.  I mean, it's...  Yes.  I love it.  Yeah, me, too.  I'm looking forward to it, guys.  I really appreciate it.  I'll see you in a little while.  All right, Mr. Williams.  I love you, Mr.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:02:30]  Coming, yeah.  Open the door for Paul Williams.  All right.  There he comes.  Fashion love song.  Welcome back.  Paul Williams.  What a pleasure.  We bow to you, sir.  I love Paul Williams.  He does.  Take a seat, sir.  Well, I'd like to sit him over here first.  Where?  What do you want?  Right there.  Right there, Mr. Williams.  We've got to call you Mr. Williams.  Mr. Williams, please.  Mr. Williams?  It's the Pauly Show.  The Opium Ads.  Yes.  The Pauly Show. 
[02:03:00]  And Pauly.  Paul Williams.  Man.  We can't believe that you don't play piano.  We're amazed by that.  Yeah, but you've got to understand something.  Yeah.  Where am I going?  We've got a mic in there.  Yeah, there's a mic right there.  Pull that mic up.  Hold on.  What button there?  The last one, this one.  Oh, my God.  There it is.  Yeah, pull that mic up.  Because you could still talk.  Okay, wait a minute.  Do you buzz you?  That's amazing.  When you keep the sound off, then it's like, you know, loneliness takes the romance. 
[02:03:30]  You could be, yeah, you could be great, you know, if you don't hear it.  How do you know what chord sounds like what if you can't play it?  Well, because, you know, do you know what it sounds like when you fart and you haven't  quite done it, you know?  Sounds like everybody else in the room going, oh.  What mic is that, Mars?  We're trying to set up Paul Williams nice here.  Hey, Paul.  Yeah.  Anthony brought up a very good, I did, point or question.  Oh, yes.  I obviously watched you years ago and all throughout your career. 
[02:04:00]  And I know, or I could remember seeing you at the piano on some of those shows singing  a song.  Yeah.  Did they maybe tape you from the other side?  No, no, no.  It was like, you know, I think I actually played a couple, you know, I'd play, I think I could  play a perfect love.  I could, but there were, but there were like shows that we do in England where you pre-record  everything.  Uh-huh.  So you're lip-syncing anyway, you know?  Oh, okay.  So it's like, when you do that, you can be the best. 
[02:04:30]  He throws his hands up in the air.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, do that thing where you get under the piano and play backwards, upside down.  Sure.  Pick it up and carry it.  Yeah.  But I can't hear anything.  Yeah, what's the matter with that keyboard there, Mars?  It doesn't sound very loud.  Where's the volume?  Oh, man.  We hear it here.  You do.  You hear it's all volumes up?  Barely.  Yeah, barely. 
[02:05:00]  People look right through me when I was all alone.  Never seemed to notice I was there at all.  There's a little volume.  They always seem to look the other way.  And winter days were colder.  You're playing the piano.  When I was all alone.  You know, but it's pretty bad.  I mean, it's like...  Wait a minute. 
[02:05:30]  You're going to make a living doing this?  Really?  Just an old-fashioned love song playing on the radio.  And wrapped around the music.  It gets pretty boring.  No, no, no.  What are you kidding?  Not for us.  Just an old-fashioned love song.  Wait.  Wait a minute.  Just an old-fashioned. 
[02:06:00]  On stage.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Coming down in three-part harmony.  It's really terrible when I do it.  That's why I spend all that money for musicians.  You know, we...  When you wrote that song, because it does have kind of a more, I don't know the word for it,  but it's a little more campy when you did it, a little more, like, almost ragtime-ish.  I did it very ragtime-ish.  Yeah, very ragtime-y.  When you, like, when Three Dog Night took it, do you have any say over how it is or what 
[02:06:30]  it sounds like and then it gets released or you can say, I don't want my song?  I'm not even allowed in the building.  Chuck Negron said, first of all, I don't want to record it.  I had three hits with Three Dog Night.  Are we on the air yet?  Yes.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Of course.  It's not interesting.  Changes nothing.  But there's a guy named Richie Podler who was their producer.  I had three hits with him.  I had Old Fashioned Love Song, Family Man, and Out in the Country, in the opposite order. 
[02:07:00]  Out in the Country, Old Fashioned Love Song, and then Family Man.  Yeah, hold on, give me 20 minutes while I remember which order they're in.  But the fact is that they didn't want to record any of those.  I wrote Old Fashioned Love Song for the Carpenters.  I knew that Richard would love it.  It was old fashioned.  It was kind of rinky dinky.  Richard Carpenter was going to love this.  He didn't listen to it through the first verse.  It was like, next.  Wow.  Wow, no kidding.  But Three Dog Night recorded all three of my songs reluctantly, and they were all three  hits.  They didn't want to do it. 
[02:07:30]  They didn't want to do it.  They didn't like me.  They didn't like my songs.  What the fuck is that?  That's a big problem.  I know.  No, but you know, actually Chuck Nightmare and I are a really good friend.  No, it wasn't a matter of if they didn't like me.  It's just they wanted to do a little edgier stuff.  But Family Man is very edgy.  Play it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, you don't have it queued up?  Oh, okay.  I'll have to be leaving.  No?  No.  We can play a little bit of that.  We could definitely.  Yeah, they made your song dark.  They made it dark.  They made it dark.  This tired city with somebody's dream.  Yeah, exactly.  Well, I'm talking about a love song, too. 
[02:08:00]  When you heard an old-fashioned love song.  This is a good old song.  Yeah, I love what they did with it.  Well, you did.  You liked it, like, right away.  You know, listen.  If I was the only one who sang my songs, I'd be hot walking horses right now.  I mean, let's just.  I mean, I wouldn't be sitting here with Opie and Anthony.  I would be, you know, go, come on, paint.  You know.  Let's get you wiped down before you catch a sneezy.  Yes.  Oh, my God.  How many hits did you have?  Not nearly enough.  Not as many as people, you know, like, we tried to really puff it up in all the bio through the years. 
[02:08:30]  I looked like a really important writer.  But there are guys out there with so many more hits than me, you know.  But, you know, I had a half dozen that kind of hung in there.  More than a half dozen, I think.  Come on.  You know what?  But, see, here's what I'm excited about.  I just turned.  You guys called me on my birthday.  Yes.  I just turned to 73.  I've got the two songs on the Daft Punk album.  I'm more excited about my two album cuts on Daft Punk.  That was really cool.  We played the whole song the other day.  It was great.  We loved it.  Well, how about Beyond?  I wrote two.  I wrote Beyond, too.  You didn't know that. 
[02:09:00]  I wrote the lyrics to that with these guys, you know.  What was the Touch one?  I loved it.  Touch is the one that I, yeah.  We like hearing it.  That's the one I sang.  Yeah, singing it.  Nine minutes long, you know, so they have to pay me double.  Yeah.  Oh, really?  That's a lot.  I hope so.  I feel a lawsuit coming.  How did that come together?  You know, they called me.  They were fans of, I did a movie in the 70s.  It was in the 70s called Phantom of the Paradise, which was, you know, which even my family didn't watch.  You know, I mean, it was like, this was not a motion picture that was going to change the world based on the number of people that went to see it. 
[02:09:30]  Except in two cities, in Winnipeg, Canada, for some reason, Winnipeg and Paris.  And so, you know, the two gentlemen of Daft Punk had seen Phantom of the Paradise like 20 times.  And they were in the studio, and Chris Caswell, who's my music director, my piano player, went in to do some piano overdubs on.  I think it was on Tron.  They were doing the score for Tron.  And they started talking about Paul Williams.  And he went, well, I just came off the road with him.  They said, we're trying to find him.  I went, oh.  And they went, ooh. 
[02:10:00]  And they called me.  And you know what?  They were fabulous to work with.  It wasn't where you went in, and they had built the house, and they were looking for wallpaper.  They were wondering what the house was going to look like.  So at the very beginning, the first song we wrote was Touch.  Wow.  Wow.  Yeah.  It's a cool song.  Listening to you sing on that was pretty cool, definitely.  Isn't that interesting?  I mean, how courageous of them.  Instead of just doing one more EDM, one more, you know, dance music album, they created that whole thing.  They could have done that, but instead they were very brave, and they got the guy that wrote. 
[02:10:30]  If I keep playing, the more times I do this, the more times I get paid for it.  I'll just have to sing a few bars.  You've heard of it more.  It's a little weird.  But what a treat.  They were wonderful to work with.  And I love that they put the astronauts' comments about seeing something out there.  Cernan's comments.  What was his name?  Yeah.  Dr. Edgar Mitchell. 
[02:11:00]  Was it Mitchell, the one who saw something out there?  Cernan.  Is his name Cernan?  Is it?  You know, I'm showing my ignorance.  I'm not sure.  At this point, I've now lost all of the fans of space travel.  But, you know, I'm 73, and it's going around.  I have a great memory, but she's back on the West Coast.  You actually, are you getting any more offers from more contemporary artists?  Not one.  No, huh?  I'm very surprised.  I bet you will.  No, actually, you know what I'm doing right now is we're writing Pan's Labyrinth as a stage musical, 
[02:11:30]  basically, you know, the Guillermo del Toro film.  Oh, yeah.  So doing that with Gustavo Santo Alaya.  And Gustavo and I just wrote two songs for a movie called The Book of Life, an animated film for Fox that Guillermo is producing.  And, you know, I've got my day gig.  I've got, you know, the two things that are really exciting in my life is, you know, the day gig at ASCAP,  finding to make sure that young rung riders can make a living and all, and my website, which is gratitudeandtrust.com.  And, you know, Tracy Jackson and I are writing a book, Gratitude and Trust Recovery is Not Just for Addicts, for Penguin. 
[02:12:00]  It'll be out next year.  So we're writing a book where, you know, we've kind of created a bunch of affirmations.  So if your life is totally screwed, you know, based on bad habits, if you're a gossip, or you keep settling down with the wrong person,  you keep marrying the last wife over and over again in a new body, we've written a lot of affirmations that can kind of help you put your life together, we hope.  Wow, yeah, yeah.  And obviously from experience, you have some experience in that. 
[02:12:30]  Absolutely, I have a black belt in whoops, you know.  I have a black belt in whoops.  I am, but it is surprising sometimes how your memory can be so good with all the drug abuse in your early years.  You know what, yeah, exactly.  You know, I misplaced, you know, the bumper sticker line is that I misplaced a decade.  You know, you're an alcoholic when you misplace a decade, you know, like, whoops, the 80s, gone.  Yeah, yeah.  Reagan president, I didn't know, I didn't know.  So, but yeah, I've been sober 23 years, and it's just been, it's been the most amazing gift, you know, to wake up in the morning and remember what I did the night before. 
[02:13:00]  I'm still embarrassed and ashamed once in a while, but at least I know what to do about it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Now I remember, and I, and yeah, the fact is that, you know, and I speak a lot.  I speak, you know, I share my story a lot at a public level and all, and it's a boring story.  It's of your basic mayonnaise and, you know, kind of a drunk-a-log, but I never came out of a blackout with a Russian arms dealer or a Norman Mailer. 
[02:13:30]  No, I can wake up on a plane to somewhere you don't know where you're going.  I come out of a blackout in the boys' department of Sears, you know, trying on, trying on reindeers.  Some tough skins.  How grateful are you?  I'm very happy that there was no Twitter when I drank and no, like, no immediate way for me to connect with a lot of people.  All we had was drink and dial.  Yeah.  All we had was drink and dial, and it was, you know, it was, and the fact is, even today, I try to not send any major, major, in totally complete sobriety. 
[02:14:00]  I don't want to send something out late at night.  If I've decided I had a brilliant moment, let's sleep on it.  Sleep on it, see if you want to, yeah, put it up there for the world to see.  Yeah.  Wow, yeah.  Of course, the other thing we're all talking about is the fact that, and it's so Muppety, that they did the Muppet nearly 35-year anniversary.  You know, Kenny Asher and I wrote the songs for the Muppet movie.  They've now released it on Blu-ray as a nearly 35th anniversary.  They released the soundtrack and asked me to write the liner notes, you know, so it was, it's interesting that that's been 35 years. 
[02:14:30]  35 years, yeah.  So I have you to thank.  It's my son's favorite movie.  I've seen it 10,000 times in the last year.  This is.  I used to love the Muppets.  This is really testing our friendship, isn't it?  Wow.  I'm sorry.  But at this point, I can name 30 Muppets easily.  Exactly.  And you have a favorite?  I love Gonzo.  Gonzo's all right.  Yeah.  I'm trying to think.  Sweetums.  Sweetums, yeah, Sweetums. 
[02:15:00]  But also, you know, I like Ratso, you know.  Ratso?  Ratso's very cool.  What do you think of the new movies?  Well, the second one's coming out, what, in the new year.  But the first one, I really liked how they kept it going.  I was really impressed with them.  You know, and they were nice enough to put Rainbow Connection in as the big number of the years.  Nice enough.  There's not a movie without that song.  You know, well, thank you very much.  Thank you, Lawrence.  What do you mean nice enough?  They had to.  It's nice to be working again.  Of course they're going to do Rainbow Connection.  It's like the Love Boat theme.  It's like you're lying there in bed, you know, in some little town in Ohio, and you turn on the TVs on for the night before, 
[02:15:30]  and your mouth tastes like the south end of a northbound Buffalo, and you're hearing,  The Love Boat.  And you were singing it.  Anthony was.  Anthony was.  Come on.  I was harmonizing with them a little bit.  I was just going, The Love Boat.  Soon we'll be making another run.  See, this is.  The Love Boat.  What I would like is, because that's what I used to sound like.  Yes, yes.  Well, that's all the cocaine.  You couldn't get your word out.  The nasal, yeah, a little nasal, because of the collapsing up there. 
[02:16:00]  I never knew that was from the Coke.  I don't know if it was or not, if it was just, you know, arrogance or whatever it was called.  Love, exciting and new.  Climb aboard.  We're bored.  We're expecting you.  See, I'd like the old me to have a conversation with the new me.  With the new you.  Exactly.  I'd say, old me, what were you thinking?  You know, fun, fun, fun.  That seems to be what anyone was thinking back in the year.  Yeah, well, you know, we did it until the wheels fell off. 
[02:16:30]  We had a lot of fun.  But, you know, I also think that a lot of that was just medicating.  You know, you're sitting there, and everything in the world is going right.  You're this little kid from Bennington, Nebraska, you know, and all of a sudden you're sitting in a room with Sinatra or Cary Grant or somebody.  You've got some part of you who goes, do I belong here at all?  And rather than look at that thought, you go, let's have one more drink here.  Ah.  You know, yeah, you medicate.  Was it a confidence thing?  Yeah.  I think so.  No, I think fear-based thinking is behind a lot of booze, a lot of drug addiction. 
[02:17:00]  You were in Smokey and the Bandit.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  My art films.  Oh, Smokey and the Bandit.  Smokey and the Bandit, one, two, and even worse.  Even worse.  Yeah, yeah.  Actually, even worse was the most fun to make.  They were a vacation to make and a job to watch.  It was like, and Billy Bob Thornton, and I think I actually used this on the air with  you guys before, but Billy Bob Thornton has the best line ever about Smokey and the Bandit.  He says, you know, in Pauline in the South, they consider Smokey and the Bandit a documentary. 
[02:17:30]  It's like, you know, and he's right.  I get off the airport, off the plane and walk through the airport in Nashville and Lil Enos  is a star.  Oh, yeah.  That first one was one of those great comedy of all time.  That's a great movie, man.  That's a great comedy.  Gleeson was playing in that.  Literally a classic.  Really funny.  Gleeson, from about 10 in the morning until about 4 in the afternoon, Gleeson was amazing.  Before 10 and after 4, you know, you were kind of taking your life in your head.  Really?  He called me Hardly.  You know, while we were shooting the first one, or no, not the first one, maybe the second 
[02:18:00]  or third one, it was, no, it must have been, I was given a star on Hollywood Boulevard.  He went, ah, you'd be given, you'd be given, given laurels.  You know, you'd be given laurels, Hardly, you know.  Oh, shit.  So then I became Hardly, so I'd go, oh, why don't we change this line?  And he'd go, Hardly, if it ain't broke, we don't fix it.  Did you get phenomenal?  Yeah, a little bit.  And we had, there was one amazing experience where we were cut loose around 4 on Pat McCormick, 
[02:18:30]  who was the great big guy that played, you know, my daddy, Big Enos Burdett.  Sure.  And so Pat and Jack and I went, and there was a Mexican restaurant that he wanted Mexican  food.  It was closed.  He went in.  He was the great one.  They opened it for him.  And he had been drinking all day, and he would drink those big plastic cups you make malts  in.  He would drink that full of, I think, vodka and air.  I don't know what he mixed it with.  But he was very, very drunk.  He got into one of these coughing fits. 
[02:19:00]  He did that for about maybe 15 minutes, and then he was just quiet, you know, and you'd  ask him a question, and instead of answering, you'd go, Oh, my God.  In fact, at one point, I went, Jack, if you're going out, if you're dying, can I have your  watch?  He opened up one eye and looked at me like, you little, I knew he was okay.  You could tell, even during some episodes of The Honeymooners, he would get into these  coughing fits, and then when he was smoking a cigar, and he'd stop and go, Pays to buy 
[02:19:30]  the best.  I loved him.  I loved him.  And, you know, I worked with Art Carney, too.  I did a movie called The Night They Saved Christmas, and Art Carney played Santa Claus.  I played his chief helper.  I played more than one elf in this lifetime.  Yeah.  I've got my own ears and pointy shoes.  But, yeah, somebody said, asked you about Pat McCormick.  I don't know if you had any Smokey in the Bandit stories with Pat. 
[02:20:00]  Well, Pat used to write the monologues for Carson, so that's where I met him.  That's where, you know, he wrote all the hilarious monologues for Carson.  Our first conscious memory is coming out of a bar, him looking at me, towering over  me, looking down at me, and he goes, You know what little guy?  You look like an aerial photograph of a human being.  What an asshole.  That's great.  I said, wasn't I stationed on you during the war?  The Worst of the Week, Countdown.

[02:24:30]  Still to come, of course, is going to be Opie doing the worst thing he's ever done to EROC.  But before that, Meghan McCain was in studio this week.  Now, Meghan McCain is the daughter of Senator John McCain.  And Opie and Anthony didn't know much about her.  Jim knew her.  I have interviewed her in the past.  And I told Opie and Anthony how wonderful this woman is.  She said she's going to be great on the show.  Jim told him. 
[02:25:00]  No, this chick is awesome.  She came in, and she blew us all away.  She blew the audience away.  She blew Opie and Anthony away.  And there's no sexual double entendre with the word blow in those sentences.  Okay?  So get your minds out of the gutter.  Meghan McCain impressed us all.  And she impresses us again here on The Countdown.  What makes a bad interview for you?  Because I've been interviewed many times terribly.  People that just aren't engaged on any level having a conversation whatsoever. 
[02:25:30]  And people that...  I have been asked such offensive questions to, and I'm not easily offended.  What's an offensive question to you?  I had a guy, and it was in Albany, New York, when I called in for my book with Mike Lee and Black.  And he was like, what's sex with a Republican like?  Like a senator's daughter.  What's sex with a senator's daughter like?  And I'm like, I'm not answering.  This is really offensive and disgusting.  And he was like, you know what?  I heard you were cool, and you're not cool, and then they hung up.  And I was like, I guess I'll go fuck myself.  Excuse me.  Have fun in Albany, sir. 
[02:26:00]  You're supposed to do.  I know.  It's just terrible.  And then I have done ones recently.  They're just bored.  They're just bored with me.  Bored with talking.  I can't see anyone being bored with you.  We've had some people pulling teeth.  Who?  Here we go again.  Because we end up forgetting them.  I love a shitty interview story.  Who are some other ones?  Why can't we remember them?  I felt tension with a few.  I'll tell you who I felt tension with.  He thought I was fucking with him, but I really wasn't.  Casey Elwes.  The guy from Princess Bride. 
[02:26:30]  Yeah, Elwes.  Yeah, I thought we were going to get into it.  And the guy from Princess Bride.  Yeah, but it turned out to be okay, but I thought we were going to get into it.  Oh, what's his name?  The one that was in here that you were going to work with.  That he ended up calling you.  What's his name?  The fucking sergeant from Saving Private Ryan.  Tom Sizemore.  Oh, Tom Sizemore.  I had a very weird...  Tom Sizemore was weird.  Wasn't he an addict, though?  Yeah, he's really weird.  I watched his show on VH1 because I'm Jewish.  How amazing was that?  Love train wrecks.  Letting them film and shit like that.  Oh, Dr. Drew's a twisted fuck.  We all know that. 
[02:27:00]  I don't know how I feel about Dr. Drew anymore.  I used to really like him, and now all those people keep dying.  Yeah.  It's terrible.  It's awful.  Yeah.  It's true.  Well, that's what has creeped us out.  Has anybody ever hit on you?  Any of you when they were doing a radio radio?  Oh, in the old days, all the fucking time, man.  I used to be a fucking looker.  Courtney Love flashed for me.  That was nice.  Courtney Love tweaked our nipples recently.  Yeah.  Like through your shirt?  Yeah, through my shirt.  I don't like...  I love my nipples. 
[02:27:30]  I love nipple play.  Jimmy loves nipple play.  I don't like nipple play.  You love nipple play?  Yeah.  I think it just looks weird.  I think it just looks weird.  Lightly touched.  I'm very jaded, Megan.  There's very few parts of my body that I haven't beaten to death.  My nipples are still uncharted waters.  I think it just looks weird when you're tweaking someone's nipples.  It just looks stupid.  Heidi Klum gave him a tweak one time, too.  Which made me...  All right.  All right.  Thank you.  Did you ask her to?  Star-studded.  Me and Anthony could have went home with Veruca Salt.  That's right.  Oh, God.  I don't know who that is.  I know. 
[02:28:00]  That's why I did it.  I'm sorry.  That's why I did it.  Is that from Willy Wonka?  Old 90s band.  Yeah.  Isn't that Willy Wonka?  It's some all rock.  Oh, right on.  It was an all rock band.  Girls.  Have you ever come in drunk?  That's good, too.  Because this is...  It's only a shimmy.  Other than you, assholes.  I'm sure we had a couple.  I thought...  Probably George Witt.  I thought George Witt smelled like booze.  I can't be wrong.  If I remember correctly, I'm thinking it was him that smelled that way.  That's a really good question.  We had Jim Jefferies come in here.  Fuck.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  Jim Jefferies drunk.  He's a comedian. 
[02:28:30]  I'm a good guy.  Oh, did he come in fucked up?  He was like on ecstasy.  He was killed out of his mind.  Yeah.  Was he a good interviewer?  Booze.  Oh, it was hilarious.  It was always great on our show.  He started making a fucking penthouse girl cry or something.  Yeah, that's the interview that he said he wanted to pull the shit out of her ass with  a knife.  What in the hell?  Oh, he was getting a...  Cindy is listening.  I apologize.  Cindy might still be listening.  What in the hell?  He was drunk.  Have we had anybody drunk?  Well, the Ed Asner interview was terrific.  I liked that one a lot. 
[02:29:00]  That was really uncomfortable in California.  And I like Ed Asner, as does everyone.  And Anthony's playing poker.  Well, I like Ed Asner, too.  I'm a big Ed Asner fan.  Tremendous.  And Opie and I are doing the show with Joe Rogan.  And Ant's playing poker.  He's at a tournament.  And Ed Asner sat down with us.  We couldn't believe we got him.  And we were talking to him for a while.  Well, I was making fun of the fact that he was the first guy out in a poker tournament.  And he didn't appreciate that.  And it wasn't even that bad.  So right off the bat, he was like grumpy.  I just had to remember. 
[02:29:30]  Do you guys have assholes coming up to you in person?  Oh, all the time.  The question is when, don't we?  All the time.  All the time.  That'll happen.  It's called management.  All the time?  No, I'm just kidding.  So one of the guys makes some hand gestures.  And Ed had to ask what that meant.  And I said, well, that is a sign we do when the guest is really boring.  And it's our way to kind of wrap up the interview.  And then he said he will never come on our show again.  And blah, blah, blah.  I was very uncomfortable.  He said, go fuck yourself. 
[02:30:00]  Ed Asner told you to go fuck yourself.  Oh, yeah.  I love that.  He did that.  I kind of love that, too.  I love that.  He's so got it.  He's got some fire love.  But afterwards, I went and got a big hug for that Asner.  A big bear hug.  Yeah, gave me a big hug.  A big furry bear hug.  There have been a handful.  You were nude.  There have been a handful that Opie and Anthony have decided at the last minute they don't want  to do.  So me and another guy, E-Rock, have to sit in here and pretend to be Opie and Anthony.  Oh, yeah.  We franchised out the show.  Are you serious?  While our guest comes in.  We've become big stars.  Yeah, they know. 
[02:30:30]  We can do things like this.  We know they don't know what we look like.  So we just tell them guys.  Think the key's opening it.  Yeah, yeah.  I think I'm Anthony.  We've done it a few times.  The image Tyree from the Giants said, you guys are Opie and Anthony.  You guys are legends.  And we were like, yeah.  And he was like, you look really young.  I know.  I think you look really young.  And we were just watching from another room.  No, we were asking questions as listeners from the other room.  I don't want to interview them.  We want to go home.  It was the guy that made the big Super Bowl catch.  Years ago.  And he wrote a book about the catch call that was more than a catch. 
[02:31:00]  And it wasn't.  And it wasn't.  Did you see Thor or the Avengers?  No.  Should I?  It was like the biggest movie of the summer.  And the guy who played Loki.  Yeah.  He's like the villain in the movie.  Okay.  They decided five minutes before he was coming in.  Since they hadn't seen the Avengers, they didn't want to do it.  So you just did it?  Yeah.  I would know.  I mean, other than I know what you guys look like.  Yeah.  Oh.  I mean, it's like, you know.  One that's certainly in the political world.  Ben Stein.  Oh, that one. 
[02:31:30]  That's a big one.  That went bad.  Fuck Ben Stein.  Really?  It was a phoner.  Cindy, I hope you're not hearing this, but fuck Ben Stein.  Phone call with Ben Stein.  I was doing a commercial, and he was on hold.  We were going to pick him up after the commercial breaks were over.  Wait.  We can play it.  You have it?  Yeah.  Let's play it.  Oh, yeah.  It's quick what happened.  It's less than a minute.  Great.  I'm so happy.  It'll be better than...  Right now, we've got to say hi to Ben Stein, Anthony.  Ben Stein.  Hey, Ben.  Hi.  How are you?  There he is.  Did I just hear you do an ad where you said somebody was going to chew down the price 
[02:32:00]  of a car?  No, he said chew down.  You just said chew down.  Oh, that's a lot different.  We wouldn't say chew down on a commercial.  We would say it during the show.  I see.  But not during a paid advertisement, Ben.  Okay.  You being of Jewish background, I would take it, Ben.  Yeah, of course.  And if we were going to say something like that, we certainly wouldn't say it just before  we talked to Ben Stein.  Talked to Ben Stein.  I see.  He sure fooled me.  Oh, my God.  Are we going to get off on a bad foot with Ben Stein right from the start?  Well, I really think that's a jackass thing to do. 
[02:32:30]  But we said chew down.  Well, it sounds just like chew down.  Oh, my God.  Well, I mean, come on.  That's a crappy thing to do.  That's just an absolutely explicit invitation to racism.  Well, it's a term that is used.  Chew.  Not chew.  I wouldn't have said chew down.  Oh, man.  Chew down.  You know, you'd say like a beaver would go at a tree.  He would chew down the tree.  Well, it sounds just like chew down. 
[02:33:00]  And anybody who's listening to it is going to know you're saying chew down with a tiny,  tiny change in the accent.  It sounds like chew down.  Oh, my God, Ben.  Are you this insane?  Are you actually this insanely crazy that you're arguing over chew or chew down?  Hello, Ben?  I think he just hung up.  Ben Stein just hung up.  Oh, shit, man.  He is pissed.  What a friggin' lunatic.  Oh, man. 
[02:33:30]  That's a stretch.  Tommy Lee interview?  Oh, Tommy Lee went bad, too.  I just remember what I think the most awkward interview was.  Wow.  I think it was Kristen Bell on the phone.  Really?  Oh, Kristen Bell, too.  What?  Can we play that for?  I don't know.  Do we have time to play the entire thing?  Oh, God.  It makes me so happy.  You want to hear a bad interview?  I want to hear every bad interview.  Yeah.  And I would blame the hosts on this one.  Oh, yeah?  That one's pretty...  I mean, that was a good one.  This is a quick one. 
[02:34:00]  This is a quick one, Ben.  Really quick.  I know.  Kristen...  We've got to interrupt this news story.  We've got a big star on the phone.  Kristen Bell, the star of Forgetting Sarah Marshall.  Kristen.  Yes?  Congratulations on the new movie.  Are you excited?  I'm so excited.  Awesome.  All right.  Wait.  Why did that happen?  Because Opie didn't want to interview her.  Because we were in the middle of a lot of important stuff. 
[02:34:30]  You hung up on her?  Yes, Opie hung up on her.  You hung up on Kristen Bell?  She's like a huge movie star.  That's what's great about that.  Awesome.  You should have seen Roland panicking after you.  Oh, he lost his mind.  You can't hang up on someone that's sort of a movie star.  If you're going to do it, you've got to do it, right?  Oh, that was great.  Was she pissed?  Oh, we never heard from her again.  I've never heard from her again.  And actually, we like her, of course.  And she was great in that movie and blah, blah, blah.  But it was just one of those things.  Linda Blair, too.  We had a good one.  Yeah.  We called up Linda Blair.  Wow, she's got us thinking here.  Yeah.  Megan McCain. 
[02:35:00]  I like it.  Linda Blair, we just recited.  We started yelling.  We just yelled into the phone, the power of Christ compels you.  And she's like, all right, guys.  All right.  We didn't stop.  It went on for five minutes.  We just wouldn't stop.  She eventually just hung up, right?  She hung up.  And then our guy there at the Comic-Con that she was at took a while to talk her back into  calling back in, saying, they'll be cool.  They were just fucking around.  She called.  If she goes, hello, the power of Christ compels you.  Again, we wouldn't stop. 
[02:35:30]  She was very angry.  And Travis is reminding me of Amanda Peet.  I forgot.  Amanda Peet?  You guys were looking at photos of her online.  Oh, Opie said something about what?  Were you, like, gross?  I think he said something about her chest.  He said something like, I see a little problem.  No, now she doesn't like me.  Well, what did you say?  She liked us until now.  No, what did you say?  I think he saw it.  I really don't remember.  I think I was making fun of her.  Were you complimenting her?  No, you know how it's kind of a bit where you have a really, you know, hot girl in 
[02:36:00]  the studio or whatever, and then you try to find that one tiny thing that she just obsesses  about her entire life.  Yeah, that tiny little thing.  It's terrible to do.  You asshole.  Is that how you pick up chicks?  It's terrible.  It's called a neg.  It's a stupid dating tactic that men use.  Is it really?  Yeah.  I didn't even know.  It was in the game by Neil Stroud.  It's in the game, yes.  It just works out for a radio.  See, you know, you like insult a woman to make her insecure, and then she'll be in  you.  That men of America never works on me. 
[02:36:30]  I'm like, go fuck yourself.  Throw a drink on you.  No, it was just the tiniest, stupidest, whatever.  And then she freaked out?  I don't know.  She was, you have it?  How long is this?  It's about two minutes, but it starts off.  I don't remember.  What about, there was also Bobby Brady.  What did we do to Bobby Brady?  From the Brady Bunch?  Yeah, Ant wouldn't stop humming Brady Bunch songs.  Brady Bunch songs.  So he threw a fastball at his head.  He threw a ball at my head.  Like a baseball? 
[02:37:00]  Yes.  That was his tune.  Oh, and then when we got Meadow Soprano crying.  Oh, you assholes.  No, we turned the mics off for that.  She cried?  I forgot why.  That one was not our fault, and we did the right thing that day.  And I actually got a, I forget now, it was probably an email from her father thanking  us for being cool.  Good.  Because she wasn't a huge star yet.  Oh, boy.  It was early on in The Sopranos.  Did we make fun of her?  And she...  No, we didn't.  We didn't make fun of her.  It was in the news.  I forgot what it was.  There was something in the news about some eating disorder stuff with her. 
[02:37:30]  So we brought it up without goofing on her or anything.  Not to make her, you know, we thought she was ready to talk about it.  And I guess she was not ready.  She wasn't over it.  She just started crying.  Has anybody else ever cried?  Oh, man.  We almost had Sugar Ray Leonard cry.  Almost.  But then Anthony couldn't handle the emotional moment we were having and fucking blew it up.  Ah, it's okay.  You're fine.  Me and Jimmy looked at each other wide-eyed like, oh, my God, we're going to have this  ex-champion fucking crying in a minute.  We had a midget stripper girl crying.  We got to stop this.  It'll be in our book. 
[02:38:00]  Well, a girl, she was a midget, and she called in and said she wanted to audition because  she wanted to be a stripper.  And we were like, well, come in.  We'll let you know if you got what it takes.  So she came in, took her clothes off, got on the console, like one of these type consoles.  Can I just interrupt to say?  On this console?  No, it's an old studio.  It was an old studio.  About 10 studios ago.  Similar.  But Tom Hanks' son was in that thing.  Yeah, yeah.  Colin Hanks and Jack Black were part of this one.  And Patrice O'Neill, I believe.  She got up there and started dancing, and I don't know.  I guess some of the people were commenting or chuckling, and she just burst into tears. 
[02:38:30]  And covered up her naughty parts.  There was a naked midget crying.  It was sad.  That was one of those shows where you leave to get your car after the show's over, and  the mics are off.  It's not fun and games anymore.  And you're just like, I'm just a horrid person.  What am I doing with my mic?  Yeah, yeah.  What am I doing?  In our defense, we weren't trying to make her go.  No.  We really weren't.

Jerry O'Connell is going to be on the show this week,  and he's a giant Opie and Anthony fan.  More specifically, a big Sam Roberts fan.  So check that out, and you can check out everything I've got going on on YouTube 
[02:44:00]  and at NotSam.com.  Now, we go to number one on the Worst of the Week countdown.  Opie doing the single worst thing he's ever done to E-Rock.  He gave E-Rock's cell phone number out on the air.  Now, of course, we did an edit for the replays,  but when this went out live, it went out live and unedited.  I don't know what the update is.  I would love to tell you what E-Rock's mind state is,  where he's at right now. 
[02:44:30]  I don't know.  You'll have to tune in Monday to the Opie and Anthony show to find out,  and that's not a tease because I want to find out as well.  Here it is, Opie destroying E-Rock's life.  In honor of Janis Joplin's death,  we've got to play Anthony's mom singing Bobby McGee.  Oh, my God.  I think it's a must.  Do we have that little clip?  Remember that?  I don't disagree.  That's another clip.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We haven't played in a while.  That was a...  That certainly could be a nugget on the Opie and Anthony podcast.  That was a good one, the old karaoke.  Whew.  Oh, boy.  You got that. 
[02:45:00]  I thought I did.  I don't...  Eric must have...  Oh, E-Rock.  E-Rock's like fucking...  Well, why would it be in Dillette?  In more ways than one, he's like fucking Newman in Jurassic Park.  Can you find it online, Sam?  Ah, ah, ah.  Seems like...  Ah, ah, ah.  Seems like all our shit is online.  Now, of course, he's got the Drew Boogie edited version, but I don't know why.  That's kind of fun, too, but...  Well, I don't know.  I think we want the raw version today.  Yeah.  If he could find it. 
[02:45:30]  If he wasn't vacationing, we would have it.  We might have to call E-Rock on vacation.  I needed something from him.  I emailed him yesterday.  Did he get back to you?  No, I emailed him late, so he probably didn't see it yet.  He should get back to you, though.  He's fine, isn't he?  Might be making love.  What's he doing?  To a sandwich.  He's in fucking...  Let's see.  He's in taking up a lot of Space Mountain.  It's a large waistband, after all.  He's not even here. 
[02:46:00]  He should have been here today to defend himself.  Yes, yes, yes.  I know.  I'm going through all the rides in my head right now.  Trying to get one.  Yeah.  Put it to an automated voice messaging system.  Damn it.  Two, zero, one.  It's not available.  Oh.  E-Rock.  At the tone, please record your message.  When you finish recording, you may hang up or press one for more.  No way. 
[02:46:30]  I don't think...  I don't think that will get it.  I think that was a little late.  Oh, no.  What did you do?  I think he just gave out E-Rock's phone number.  No one's going to believe I didn't mean to do that.  Fuck.  I was looking going...  I swear I didn't mean to do that.  I'm going to...  I thought you were letting the numbers play out.  No, man.  He is going to kill you.  Fuck.  Nobody will call. 
[02:47:00]  Oh, no.  I'm on so much allergy shit.  Do you want it taken out of the replay?  Of course.  Of course.  Maybe.  Oh, my God.  It's too late.  It's going to be on Twitter.  It's going to be on every website.  It's going to just fucking...  And believe me, the listeners will be so nice to him.  Hey, fatty.  How many slobos is he going to get?  You're pushing it forward now, sir.  I didn't give it out.  You're pushing it forward.  You know how many messages?  You have 163 messages. 
[02:47:30]  Slobbo!  Slobbo!  Slobbo!  Slobbo!  Slobbo!  Slobbo!  Slobbo!  Slobbo!  Slobbo!  Did we get it in time?  Oh, my Lord.  I don't think so.  We rarely hit that dump button.  I hit it for all it was worth, and I don't think...  Ask the people down below.  Or are they listening to the...  No, they listen to the direct feed, so no matter what, they're going to get it.  Seriously?  They get it through my headphones.  Oh, fuck.  Oh, no. 
[02:48:00]  They're the privileged few that hear my exact headphone feed.  They actually hear Travis go, three minutes.  Oh, really?  Oh, the magic.  They hear the magic.  Can they hear this?  Peck-a-juice!  They heard that.  Well.  Useless.  Just useless, too.  I didn't mean to do that.  He's not going to believe me, but he's not.  I literally thought you were just teasing it, like giving out the first drink.  No, I wasn't.  I was thinking about what I wanted to say. 
[02:48:30]  I had some terrific things to say in his voicemail that would have made everyone laugh.  What were you thinking as the numbers going out?  I was just thinking.  I was focusing on what...  I knew what I wanted to say.  It doesn't matter anymore.  Oh, no.  I have to know what you were going to say now.  No, it doesn't matter.  Oh, my God.  I'll go check if it made it through or not.  He's going to have to change this.  What do you mean?  Henry said it through that part.  That's all that matters.  That part is enough.  Well, not really.  Really?  Yeah, they're pretty cool.  They're the elite. 
[02:49:00]  Well, tell the elite to do the right...  The regular listeners.  Tell the elite to do the right thing, please.  Yeah, they could be nice.  See?  We can be nice.  I'm begging, actually, because I really did not mean to do that.  That's really shitty of me.  Oh, boy.  That's really shitty of me.  Fuck.  He's going to have to change his number now.  Oh, no.  He's never going to believe you didn't do that on purpose.  I know.  He's going to think.  I know.  Why?  Why would my number two hero do that to me? 
[02:49:30]  It made it on air, according to Twitter.  Uh-oh.  From when someone said...  According to Twitter, as they quote the number?  No, no, no.  I heard it in my car, and I can rewind it to hear it again.  Oh, no.  That's right.  Kevin O'Brien.  I've already tried to call him ten times.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  This is bad, Opie.  This is bad.  Fuck.  Oh, well. 
[02:50:00]  Oh, boy.  The dump didn't work.  I dumped out immediately after you said it, and I just listened to the iPhone app, and  it didn't work.  The dump did not work.  Well, you got tacos.  At all?  Or did it dump later?  I saw it roll.  I saw it count back to eight.  So it must have dumped, but we dumped too late.  No, I didn't.  I don't hear anything.  There was no dump at all?  No.  So the dump doesn't work? 
[02:50:30]  Dump doesn't work, E-Rock.  The dump doesn't work.  But let it be wrong.  Oh, here comes Mars now.  Here comes Mars.  I believe the dump does work.  I guess we get...  Damn, that's a good dump.  No, we work in the dump.  I hit the dump button.  Yes, this is a dump.  Now Mars is running into your studio, Travis.  Yeah, that's fine.  I mean, I hit the dump button.  Sam, are you upset that it went out over the air?  It's unfortunate that it went out over the air.  That's pretty funny.  Somebody says he's going to change his outgoing voicemail message to Opie's phone number. 
[02:51:00]  Oh, shit.  If you're trying to get in touch with me, please call me.  Yeah.  Oh, shit.  Oh, man.  That's fucking...  No, the destroyer...  All right.  I don't even know what...  Assholes.  Oh, jeez.  Don't worry.  No one will call.  Mars, I blame you.  The dump button didn't work.  Oh, it did work.  It did work.  Yes, but I don't know.  Travis says he didn't cut out what it was supposed to, so I don't know. 
[02:51:30]  I heard it a little late.  I was stunned.  I was looking at Opie, and then Opie goes...  Hit it.  So I hit it, but it was probably too late.  I didn't know that was E-Roc's number.  I didn't know what you were doing.  I didn't either.  I thought you were doing a bit like you called up something else.  Oh, I was doing the cold call.  And I was going to, in my way, tell them we were looking for something.  That's all.  Why would you have your dumb number on the fucking thing?  I do.  It's the automatic.  Oh, the automatic default voicemail.  Right. 
[02:52:00]  No, you've got to do it.  Hi, you've reached Anthony.  I'm not giving my number out.  Leave a message after the beepy tone.  What happened?  The dump, it kicks in.  It literally, it dumped right after the last number.  Oh.  So it goes from the full phone number to, I don't think that'll get it.  Oh, we just missed it.  Oh. 
[02:52:30]  Although even if the last number was cut off, people would, they would hunt.  Nine tries.  They would hunt around for the valuable E-Roc number.  Yeah, but they wouldn't know which was his, though, so they would just...  Well, that's true.  They would leave Slobo on ten fucking numbers.  Slobo.  Never going to believe.  Oh, no.  Oh, my God.  Someone on Twitter said, definitely just left a message saying, the Opster sent me Slobo.  Oh, no. 
[02:53:00]  Look at this.  Please do not send...  Do not text Slobo cockpicks.  What are you doing?  I'm just reading people's, like, they want to help.  And they're saying what not to do with his number.  You're pushing this forward.  But I'm going to get so much shit.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  It's already a meme.  Oh, no.  It's a topless picture of E-Roc. 
[02:53:30]  It's got his phone number at the top, and then it says, call me, ladies.  Oh, no.  What a horrible picture.  I want to feel up E-Roc.  It's got nice cans.  Oh, no.  This Disney vacation is ruined.  It's ruined.  He'll be trying to just, like, you know, figure out what to do.  All these texts will pop up.  Oh, God. 
[02:54:00]  This is how serious I am about this.  How ex-them are you?  If E-Roc will accept my apology, I will disable my Candy Crush.  What?  How much does that make to E-Roc?  That's crazy.  I'm obsessed with Candy Crush, and he knows that'll hurt.  I'm stuck on level 350.  I will say goodbye to Candy Crush.  Wow.  I will uninstall it right now.  Yeah, that's not a really...  I'll say this. 
[02:54:30]  It's not really...  To make up for something like that, you don't remove a little treat from yourself.  A game, yeah.  A little guilty pleasure.  If you forgive me, I won't eat cake this weekend.  I will uninstall Candy Crush.  That would really hurt me.  It's just mean.  That would really hurt on a personal level.  I'm obsessed with this stupid game.  Yeah, yeah.  I will say goodbye to it.  How does that do anything for E-Roc?  Yeah.  Nothing.  I can't think of anything else to do.  Ten.  I mean, a little matter of 1700 bucks.  Shut up, Sam. 
[02:55:00]  I'll crunch the fucking numbers.  Plus whatever is going on in that...  What if...  All right, I got a new one.  Chubby boy's mind.  No, I got a new one for real.  How about if you pay for part of his vacation?  I will pay for his entire vacation.  Whoa!  Not meals.  Oh, my God.  Not meals.  Thank you, Jimmy.  Jimmy, just save me.  Meals not included.  I will pay for the hotel bill, including room service.  Whoa.  That's a gamble right there.  And I will pay for the flights.  And the phone. 
[02:55:30]  Wow!  He's got my word.  Holy shit!  That's righteous.  He's got my word.  That's righteous.  I'm still going to Operation Drop going on with the flight.  Oh, God.  You're dealing with...  What do you mean?  You're dealing with Greg Hughes right now.  I'm serious.  Wow!  As much as it's easy to make the jokes and keep going with this, I will do that for him immediately.  So you're willing to pay for three seats?  But he's got to...  He's got to sort of accept my apology that I didn't mean to do this. 
[02:56:00]  But I will do that immediately.  Oh, conditional.  Conditional.  I think that's more than fair.  That's more than fair.  That's way more than $1,700, dickhead.  Well, you need to also do the $1,700.  Shut up.  That's just a vacation.  He's got a phone to deal with now.  Yeah, because then it'll be the vacation minus $1,700.  Let's see how much the vacation costs.  That might have been a pretty penny.  Those tickets are expensive.  Yeah.  Just the park tickets.  Either way.  I didn't say park tickets.  Well...  I didn't say park tickets.  Park tickets are pretty expensive.  What the fuck?  I said hotel, room service, and the flights. 
[02:56:30]  Has he been using the Fat Pass?  When it gets you to the front of the line?  All right, wait.  What's a Fat Pass?  Fast Pass.  He said Fast.  I said Fast Pass.  What?  That's pretty good, because you show up at a certain time,  and you just get right in.  All right.  Very convenient.  I'm going to...  He's not writing me back.  He's probably not looking at his phone.  Oh, man.  Text him that.  He'll look at it.  He'll read a text.  If he sees Opie, text him.  So text him your proposition. 
[02:57:00]  And make sure you say the vacation plus $1,700 for a new phone.  Shut up.  Yeah.  If his phone's going straight to voicemail, he doesn't have it on.  He's not going to see the text.  Well, there's the work phone.  There's also email.  Oh, that's true.  Yeah, email.  The work phone.  I emailed him last night asking for a favor.  Oh, boy.  How'd that work out for you?  Not good.  Jesus.  I'm going to get right for vacation.  You need to counterbalance a piano?  All right.  Pianos are so heavy.  They are.  It's crazy. 
[02:57:30]  All right.  Here we go.  I could never lift one.  Here we go.  Why would I need that?  I know.  Why would you even need to do that?  Why would I ask a friend?  Oh, that's terrible.  You see it for yourself.  Let's see.  Okay.  All right.  Willing to pay.  I fucked up.  Okay.  Yeah.  You...  I fucked up, which I've said many times already, but he's not writing me back.  I will pay for your entire vacation to show how sincere I am.  Check on Monday.  Oh.  Wow.  Send.  He'll...  Send.  Here's what Iraq will do.  He'll know by reading these that you're probably being very sincere. 
[02:58:00]  He'll know, like, all right, something stupid happened, whatever it was.  Then, he'll milk it a little bit.  He'll accept the apology, but he'll...  It's almost like when you argue with your chick and you say you're sorry.  She's like for...  You're walking on eggshells for a couple days just to be nice.  So he'll kind of milk it like that, but he'll accept it because he'll know you're being truthful.  And then he'll forget that I made that offer and he'll be like, no, man, that's cool.  That's cool.  Right.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Sure.  Okay.  He's so taking that offer.  Dude, he would be thrilled, even though he's wealthy nagel, you know. 
[02:58:30]  Yeah, he's got the nagel fortune, he's a lottery winner, things like that, property owner.  One thing is he's going to have to take the vacation money to buy the new phone.  That's what I'm saying.  Well, the vacation's 500 bucks.  I mean, 5,000 bucks, or whatever it is.  Jeez.  Dude, I think you're fucking...  Yeah.  Disney, you're paying for the rooms?  You're paying for the room and you're paying for the flights.  Yeah, well, the room service took you 8,000 to 5,000.  That's...  I made more than that just talking about this. 
[02:59:00]  I love guys that say, you know, if Bill Gates is walking, he drops $10,000, he loses money if he stops to pick it up.  That's a good one, Chip.  People say that.  I know.  Those dummies.

How does rust get in to destroy your engine's fuel system?  It's caused by water.  Attracted by the ethanol that's in your gas tank right now.  Ethanol is in nearly every gallon of retail gas.  It attracts 50% more water than unleaded.  And with water, that means corrosion can begin at any time.  But you can protect your engine with the BG ethanol defender service.  BG cleans, dries, and protects the entire fuel system. 
[03:00:30]  And you can find this service at a shop near you at BGfindashop.com.  Remember these two letters.  BG.  Hi, Adam Hewson here, co-creator of Market Club.

It's More Stories, the podcast.  That's my podcast.  That's your podcast.  Is there music here? 
[03:04:00]  No, we're coming out of Unchained by Van Halen.  Oh, I love that song.  Unless there's some ad that comes up last minute, we'll drop it in real quick.  So whoever you just heard.  One break coming up.  You know what weird it was to have him sitting here?  He came on your show?  I'm very slowly cobbling together the sounds of my youth.  It's the one giant band in my garage.  Oh, that's fantastic.  Queens of the Stone Age and Perry Farrell from Jane's Addiction.  Wow.  Buck McKay.  Did he tell you?  The Roses.  Oh, really?  Bootsy Collins.  And in my mind, one night I'm just going to fall off the wagon, do mushrooms, go up to 
[03:04:30]  San Ysico Ranch, and just everyone in my head just cobble together the most fucking  sick concert.  It'll be a two-day event.  Yeah.  Diamond Dave will come out and be like, Bootsy, bye.  Everybody ready to go?  Hamila, zimila, bibila, hamila, bibila, zimila.  I ain't got nobody.  More palooza.  More palooza.  More palooza.  Pot-a-palooza.  Did David Lee Roth tell you the Brown M&M story?  No.  Oh.  You tell me it.  As him.  Well, you see, Jay, back in the 70s, we, Van Halen, we were the largest stage show at 
[03:05:00]  the time, you see.  And at that time, you know, Eddie, who was a stickler for his sound and whatnot, had a  manual.  And I'm telling you, this thing was as thick as a phone book.  And with all the specific and explicit instructions, the stacks, where the amplifiers are supposed  to be, and so on and so forth. 
[03:05:30]  And so, you see, what Eddie would do is, in the middle of all of these instructions, you  see, was to put a clause in there that said, no M&Ms are to be delivered to Van Halen in  perpetuity, throughout the universe, so on and so forth.  And that's the rumor.  And far be it from me to get in the way of a rumor, Jay.  But we knew that if the promoter, once we arrived backstage and saw Brown M&Ms, we know 
[03:06:00]  that they had not read the writer.  And therefore, no reason to do the sound check, because we'd be out there for hours.  So that's why we put the Brown M&Ms.  It's actually, actually a professional provision.  Sorry.  She, yeah, now you've got the kids on board.  The kids love David Lee Roth. 
[03:06:30]  He was fun.  He was a good time.  But you, you're in that upper 1% when people lose their minds when you were here.  Like you, John DiMaggio, Barry Katz.  There are a few people where there are a few episodes.  The music ones I'll put in a separate category, because it's, you're tugging at people's, you  know, hearts.  Like it's what they did when they had their first cast, made it out, and wrestling practice,  football practice, what was planned.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  No, you shoot the single.  He throws the cross face.  You're in a whizzer.  When you circle around, next thing you know, you're making out. 
[03:07:00]  You both weigh 135 pounds.  It's any man's game.  Yeah, you smell the same, you know, you're wearing the same thing.  You know how to get the man in and out of that singlet.  Singlet.  You know what feels good when you're wearing the singlet?  It's natural.  It does feel good.  You're 15 years old.  You're rolling on the mat.  It's intoxicating.  You have a podcast called the 10 Minute Podcast with Chris Delia.  Chris Delia and Brian Callen.  Chris what now?  Delia.  Chris Delia?  Well.  Delilah?  Delia.  It's a D apostrophe E-L-I-A.

Chubby guy with the Don Johnson beard.  The full beard.  It was really alarming.  I had a beard?  Yeah.  Remember that you had the big long one? 
[03:08:00]  Oh, yeah.  I had that big, yeah, yeah.  Well, that's one of your pro wrestling when you appear at your pro wrestling promotion.  I do some gymnasium shows, yes.  No, but you do do pro wrestling promotions.  Well, I have appeared with the WWE in the past, yeah, doing stuff with them.  What do you do?  Do you run around, hit the turnbuckle?  Yeah, you get beat up.  You know, you usually get beat up at the end of any appearance.  Back in the day, I had Mad TV, and then, you know, I'd do an impersonation of Stone  Gold, and then on Mad TV, and he'd come on the show.  And then I show up on their show, and I'm Stone Cold, and he doesn't like it, and he 
[03:08:30]  comes out, and he cuts a promo on whoever, talking about, you know, this Sunday, blah,  blah, blah.  And then he beats the snot out of me, and the kids like that.  We did it to promote the Three Stooges.  You let Sean Hayes get in the ring?  Sean Hayes, yeah, got in the ring.  No.  He didn't do anything.  That would be great.  Just him and Christy Amantopoulos got in the ring as Larry and Mo.  The guy nobody knows?  What's that?  Does anybody know who that guy is?  I'm being serious, because he did such a good job.  He did an amazing job, and Chris Amantopoulos is one of the most talented people I've ever 
[03:09:00]  been around.  Chris is his first name.  Chris is his first name.  Amantopoulos.  Amantopoulos.  Amantopoulos.  Amantopoulos.  I'm not making a joke.  I want to get it right, because...  Amantopoulos.  He's Greek.  Because it was alarming good, how good he was in the Three Stooges.  I'm telling you, that guy spent a dozen years on Broadway.  Anyway, he's an incredibly well-trained actor.  Amantopoulos.  No, that's Bette Midler.  Yeah, on Broadway.  Is that on Broadway?  I don't know.  I'm cracking the boards.  That's probably in Cats.

Can you fucking turn this off on my shoulder?  Do they have...  I'm watching two guys house hunting in Toronto, and Matty Boy just stares at it when we record.  You're not even watching it.  They're watching orange juice commercials. 
[03:10:30]  Yeah, but I can see it in the corner of my mouth.  My corner of my mouth.  The corner of your mouth.  I really fucked up, man.  I ain't gonna lie to you.  I love...  Do they have...

You wanna hear it?  Sure.  I don't wear a condom 
[03:11:00]  Cause I gotta let my jizz flow.  I gotta let my jizz flow.  Mm-hmm.  Go to jaymore.com.  That's how Paul Prebenza looked at you  when you did your Ryan Gosling impression.  There it is.  Well, that's actually on points.  I don't know.  Really?  Let me set it up.  Ryan Gosling, born in Canada.  Yeah.  Raised in Orlando.  Yeah.  Never has acted without a New York accent.  Interesting.  Every movie.  Interesting.  Let's hear it.  What's up, Will?  How you doing?  I'm doing pretty good. 
[03:11:30]  How you doing?  Good.  I'm Ryan Gosling.  Yeah.  Hey, how are you?  Where are you from?  Canada.  Oh, cool.  That's it.  That's my impression.  I thought it was a little more...  A little more like this.  Like Blue Velvet.  What do you want me to do?  He does have a little bit of that.  What do you want me to do?  I just saw that movie with him and Steve Carell.  I saw it on a plane.  Yeah, he's like the ladies, man.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Buy your ladies drinks.  Yeah.  He's very quiet.  He'd be very interesting for a sound department.  No, no, no.  I think he's great, too.  For a Canadian.  Yeah.  He's from the same area I'm from. 
[03:12:00]  Oh, okay.  Vancouver, yeah.  Did you guys know each other before you came down to Hollywood?  No, no, no.  Did you bits?  Did you bits?  No, no, no.  We didn't do any skits and bits.  Far be it from me.  I'm also freaked out by your David Lee Roth impression.  Listen, big announcement, Will Sasso.  You're here, and then we're going to pile in headfirst at Will Sasso on Twitter.  Just best Vine videos of all time.  I think that's your title now.  You hear that guy?  Still AOL.  Old school money.  What's up?  That was really old school.  I met the guy whose voice that is.  That's a real guy?  He's a cameraman.  No, it's a cat. 
[03:12:30]  Why?  Don't these aren't these things computer generated?  That's a real person?  It's a guy.  He's a cameraman in a local news in Pittsburgh.  How did that happen?  I don't know.  Well, you've got to have him on.  They paid him like $2.50 like 30 years ago.  And I go, no way.  And they go, yeah, that's the guy.  And I go, they told him before I get it out.  He's just pushing the camera across like the news to do the cooking segment.  Oh, that's amazing.  And he just goes, you've got mail in my face.  Get the fucking way for me.  Did it sound like it?  Well, yeah, because it was him.  Understood, but they didn't just catch him once saying it, and it was perfect, and he  could never recreate it again. 
[03:13:00]  He actually sounds like that.  No, I don't know what he sounds like.  I just know he turned to me and said, you've got mail.  Yeah.  That was the only thing he said to me.  Oh, okay.  Because he was pushing a camera.  Because when you do morning TV in cities, not L.A. really, but there's always like,  you're always going to go after somebody makes an omelet.  Right.  Yeah, absolutely.  Coming up next, funny man, Jay Moore.  And you're like, have you ever been asked to, pardon me, have you ever been asked to  like, to take part in the, in the time?  Yeah. 
[03:13:30]  And you got to, then you got to eat some buttery eggs or something, you know?  I wish.  I was in Houston, it was crawfish, and it was like 6.30 in the morning, and the local  language was like, mmm, that's good crawfish, man.  Like off camera, they just let their guard down.  Like, mmm, crawfish, delicious here now.  Come on, huh?  Muffin underscore man.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Don't eat anything.  That's, if you're a.  Ever.  Don't eat anything ever.  If you want to be successful, never.  Don't eat.  Don't eat.  Don't eat, man.  That's one of my rules to success. 
[03:14:00]  Don't eat.  Don't eat anything.  Never.  Don't be, don't be friends with Andy Dick.  And never.  What?  I don't know.  I know him.  That's not a nice thing to say.  I smoked pot with Andy Dick and Mrs. Poole from the Hogan family.  Oh my goodness.  Who's that old gal?  The, the, the one not.  Hello, Hogan's.  But she was like that all the time.  We were at some like.  The blonde.  No, old redhead.  Who am I talking about? 
[03:14:30]  I don't know.  Jesus Christ.  You guys are going to make me IMDB mid-show?  I'm sorry about what I did with the door earlier.  Yeah.  For those of you listening, which is everybody, it's a dumb ass thing to say in a podcast.  For those of you listening.  Those of you who aren't one of us three people.  Like some guy's just waving his arms around at his speakers.  Like, what's happening?  No bueno.  For those of you listening to the podcast right now.  Instead of eating it. 
[03:15:00]  You're reading a podcast, man?  I have eaten a podcast.  Come on, man.  Crawfish.  Oh, man.  Come on, man.  I'm sure there's someone from Louisiana with a podcast called Eat My Podcast.  Oh, there has to be.  Yeah, you see, honey, it's kind of like eating my pussy, but it ain't.  So don't get mad.  It's not.  We're still church-fearing folk.  Jimmy, why would you have a pussy?  No, I wouldn't.  I don't.  No, I understand.  Well, that's not.  It's not.  It's just a fun thing to call a podcast.  I thought you should have called it the Jimmy Buell Podcast.  But everybody just calls it that, sweetheart.  We had this conversation. 
[03:15:30]  Nobody calls it Jimmy Buell because you're the only Jimmy Buell alive.  Well, that's why I love you, sweetheart.  I love you, too.  I love you, too.  I believe that's my Mountain Dew.  Yours has the straw on it.  Yours has the straw.  Yeah, mine always has the straw.  That's right.  Please hand me back the Mountain Dew.  Because my teeth is too rotted out from all the Mountain Dew.  So doctor said.  My teeth are is all rotted out.  My teeth are.  A double negative positive.  My teeth are is all rotted out.  I love you.  I love you, too.  Oh, here comes Stone Cold E.T.  He would like a couple of White Castle cheeseburgers to go. 
[03:16:00]  Stone Cold E.T.  So, Will Sasso, we had a contest on this, and I'm going to let you judge.  Okay.  We had a good sponsor, GoDaddy.com, and people go to GoDaddy.com  and type in stories, and the contest was come up with the best URL,  the best .com name that's super, super inside joke to this podcast.  Oh, that's fun.  Things that have been said in the past, and for $2.49, you get your own URL,  you get your own website up and running.  And the funny thing to me is when I start, Matty, you have not seen these. 
[03:16:30]  I have not.  So the funny thing is when I start reading one, two, three, four, six finalists we have.  They're pretty good.  And the winners get T-shirts, and I'll send them something.  It'll be good.  Third prize, I'm going to go to your house, and I will suck your dick.  Gee whiz.  That's a third prize.  How about that Internet nowadays, huh?  Yeah, third prize.  It's unbelievable.  That's third prize?  Yeah.  Well, it was going to be fifth, but I'm like, I don't want people to think like we're just  tapping out after one.  First prize, you get a shirt.  First prize.  T-shirt that says more. 
[03:17:00]  Hold on a second.  I don't even want to know what the second prize is, but you will fillet somewhat.  Two shirts is second prize.  Yeah.  Well, this is all the way around.  I go the other way.  I take the corporate paradigm, and I put it on its ear.  Oh, that's interesting.  I don't play by the rules.  That's pretty cool.  I'm like Slappy and the Stinkers.  They were great.  They were great.  What was their song again?  No, the movie with B.D. Wong, Five Children, and a Seal.  No.  It was five kids, one seal.  That's not a real movie.  No rules.  Oh, yeah.  Slappy and the Stinkers.  B.D. Wong, Five Kids, and a Seal.  Yeah. 
[03:17:30]  Matt, you know it, right?  You know it, right?  I can't talk.  You know of it?  No, I don't.  Really?  Sissy's all over it.  Who else was in it?  I own it.  You own it?  B.D. Wong.  Who else was in it?  They got the five kids.  They got the seal.  A seal double.  The seal had a few doubles.  Arnold Schwarzenegger was in it.  Arnold Schwarzenegger was in it.  By the Steel wasn't listening to him.  Oh, no.  Yeah.  Why?  Come on.  Listen to me.  Don't you sit there and hunk your horn with your nose. 
[03:18:00]  Wow.  B.D. Wong.  He's underrated.  So third place is Jay Moore fellates you.  I don't know where I'm losing you on this.  All right.  I'm trying to understand.  First place, I announced that you're the winner.  Yeah.  And I send you a t-shirt that says Moorier.  The shirts that I've made up for this podcast.  Cool.  Or a More Stories podcast.  Or put your name on a t-shirt.  You know what?  Fuck it.  I'll send you the shirts.  Yeah.  Second prize, you get doubles of each shirt.  So you get six shirts.  You can wear one and I'll sign the other three. 
[03:18:30]  Second prize.  Yeah.  You get more shirts.  Third prize.  I go to your house at your convenience.  Yeah.  And I perform oral sex on your penis.  Okay.  So it has to be a guy.  The third prize has to be a guy has to win it.  Well, I can't suck a woman's penis.  I know that.  That's what I'm saying.  That sort of precludes half your...  It's a woman or it'll just be the neighbor.  Yeah.  You know what?  That's fair.  You get a blowjob for your neighbor.  Closest proximity.  If it's a woman, man of your choice.  Man of your choice.  You just go like, you know...  That's a heck of a gift.  A friend of mine is a smelly hobo outside Vons.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[03:19:00]  He'll have some Listerine on his balls.  You don't feel like doing it?  You know, I think George who works at the thrift shop is a gay man.  Maybe he'd enjoy a blowjob from Jay Moore.  Is that the fellow with the Eat My Podcast podcast?  No, that's Jimmy...  What was his name?  Jimmy Buell.  Yeah.  Jimmy Buell.  I think he might be a homosexual also.  And I know sponsors love...  He drinks Mountain Dew from a straw like a lady.  Sponsors love when you talk about oral sex right as you talk about their product.  But hey, man.  We keep it real here. 
[03:19:30]  Hey, man.  You really put the chips.  You know?  Here's the thing.  GoDaddy.com.  Type in in referral.  There's like a referral box or a checkout box.  You check out stories.  You type in the word stories, like more stories.  And you create a website for yourself.  And you can do whatever you want with the website.  And if you don't want to be in the contest, if you want to create a website, like let's  say you're a photographer and you want people to see your photography.  So you go, hey, look, I take pictures.com. 
[03:20:00]  And then you do that.  But it's only $2.49 for the whole year.  It's an absurdly great deal to start your own website.  Get it up and running.  You can sell merchandise.  All of it.  There's a lot of things that happen when you have your own podcast.  As you know, 10minutepodcast.com.  Not one of our finalists.  Now, Will Sasso, I will probably have to explain a couple of the inside jokes to you.  Okay.  Because you're backlogged.  That's why we're going to one a week.  Right.  All right.  Spillingmyjizz.com. 
[03:20:30]  That's already a favorite of mine.  That's from a young man named, not a young man.  It's a woman named Nicole Hadley.  There it is.  Nicole.  The women are dominating.  Nobitingman.com from Stuart Rosenthal.  That's an old Barry Katz reference.  His kids were fighting when I was at his house.  His two sons were wild.  And one kid came in with like a gash.  Like he got stabbed in a knife fight.  And they're like, hey, your other kid.  I want to say his kid's name's on the air. 
[03:21:00]  Your other kid bit me.  And Barry goes, listen.  And he sits them both down.  He's about to give him like this crazy Newt Rockne at a parrot speech.  And he goes, looks over one, looks over the other, and just goes, no biting man.  And gets up and gets back to me and my important business that was like, what am I getting  paid for Fruit of the Loom?  This is bullshit.  Spillingmyjizz.com.  That's from Matty's song.  Gotta let my jizz spill.  First time he sang it was Gotta Let My Jizz Spill. 
[03:21:30]  And it turned into flow because John DiMaggio did it as Barry White.  He's gotta let my jizz flow.  Yeah.  That's probably a smoother way.  This one no one here will get at all.  This is from the Ron and Fez show.  Um, J-W-A-H-D.  J-W-A-H-D.  Damn it, Staros.com.  Does that make any sense to you?  Absolutely.  It's from a movie.  I've never heard that said before.  Damn it, Staros.  Damn it, Staros.  You gotta take the man and take the hell. 
[03:22:00]  What was that?  It's Thin Red Line.  And I did, I was doing Ron and Fez show, uh, in early in the morning.  I was doing Opie and Anthony, but I think Ron Bennington was sitting in.  And I just took a shot at Nick Nolte from Thin Red Line.  Yeah.  And I did the worst.  Like, no, that sounds exactly like him.  I like how you go up.  Because most people are like, oh, yeah.  Damn it, Staros.  You gotta just take that hell.  But when I said it, it goes up in the end.  Ron Bennington told me, he goes, no, that sounds exactly like him.  It's spooky.  Yeah.  But I didn't know if Ron Bennington was fucking with me, or if he was really meaning it. 
[03:22:30]  But Ron Bennington is such a master at this game of radio and all this, that I still, to  this day, don't know.  But that's way inside.  Not having to do with the podcast, however.  But I will say this, Jouad.  The fact that you went that deep, because that was like three years ago.  Okay.  MaddieNeedsAMike.com from Maureen Ulm.  Hi, Maureen.  The girls.  I like it.  Hey.  What can I say? 
[03:23:00]  MyPuddingExploded.com.  That's a universal theme.  That's just a good...  That's from Rob...  That site should be up.  That's from Rob Van Brunt?  I don't know him.  I just put it in the final mix, because...  My Pudding Exploded.  I don't remember that from anything specifically.  Is that from just like pooping our pants or something?  I don't remember anybody saying it.  And you've listened to the podcast.  You listen to each one like six times.  Yes.  You get to edit it.  I do.  Yeah.  Your Pudding Exploded could be a reason to let your jizz flow.  Like, now dig this.  Just try to go with me on this. 
[03:23:30]  If you're the gentleman in the song from whom the narrative is delivered...  The protagonist.  The protagonist, if you will.  The protagonist of the R&B.  Correct.  Okay.  He's got...  He's had some bad experiences in the past, because he produces so much semen that the  condom bursts.  Okay.  My Pudding Exploded.  You see what I'm saying?  His Tapioca Exploded in the groves.  That would be more, I think, Tapioca Direct.  Yeah.  I think Pudding is...  Yeah, I think...  It's always chocolate, unless otherwise specified.  I think it's just spraying shit all over a wall.  That's true. 
[03:24:00]  Yeah, that is sort of scatological.  All right, never mind.  I think you can let your gist spill, and that would cause someone's Pudding to explode.  Cause someone to shit all over the wall?  Yeah, you know.  Like, if you...  People would have said that, like, you're the dumbest human being you'd ever come across.  Like a coach that's had it.  The team's 2-8.  Like, really?  That's how we're going to win?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Really?  You're not going to shit all over the wall?  Now, is that right, Matthew?  That would cause me to send feces all over the wall, through my corduroys. 
[03:24:30]  Final entry, Doug Levy, synthetic, well-coiffed, upper-lipped facialhair.com.  Is this also for me?  No, it's for me.  It's for me and Will Sasso.  Wow.  So...  All right.  No Biting Man is so obvious.  It's really good.  And good.  And the fact that it's Katz, who also has a podcast, Industry Standard, here...  Oh, man. 
[03:25:00]  He does it here?  No.  With you guys?  I don't know.  He does it on my label.  Yeah.  I'm the Shug Knight of this bitch.  Yeah.  And Maddie produces it.  So let's...  We got to remove, damn it, Staros.  I'm sorry, Jawad.  But that's too inside.  That's not the podcast.  That's from an appearance on another show.  Right.  However, man, I loved it.  Points.  You get points for it.  Yeah.  He sure is listening.  He's following your brand, as they say.  Yeah, I like that.  Maddie needs a mic.com from Mo Olm, Maureen Olm. 
[03:25:30]  That would be way higher up, but Maddie's had a mic for months.  Right.  This is exactly the point of people being behind on the podcast.  This kid's had a mic since we had...  Who was it?  Oh, Lisa Left Eye Lopez, when she was on.  Yeah, that was a long time ago.  He's had a mic.  She's been dead for a long time.  Oh, you guys fucking around?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  I'm like, I don't know.  My pudding exploded.  She died years ago. 
[03:26:00]  I just took a pencil and tried to cross these off my laptop.  Oh, my goodness.  My pudding exploded is out, because we don't know what it means, Rob Van Brunt.  So it's between No Biting Man, SpillingMyJizz.com, and synthetic, well-coiffed, upper-lipped facial hair.  Now, you know where I'm going to vote.  No, I don't, actually.  I don't.  All right.  So we got three.  SpillingMyJizz.com by Nicole Hadley.  The fact that a woman had to go to GoDaddy.com and drop $2.50. 
[03:26:30]  Is there a photo of Nicole?  No.  Okay.  I'm just curious.  But I'll tell you what.  I think that URL is probably spoken for, because, like, porn websites.  No, it's not, because we check it.  You looked it up, and it's not spoken for.  Yeah, I'll go to it right now.  That's amazing.  That's the great thing about GoDaddy.  There it is.  They were a good sponsor, and we had a good contest.  I used to play this game with my friend where we would just come up with horrible URLs, horrible pornographic URLs.  Yeah, I've got a list of a bunch, too.  And then you'd enter them, and usually some other larger porn site owns that domain, because they are waiting for, you know, the dregs of society to enter that. 
[03:27:00]  I like this game.  What's the one that you guys came up with?  Well, you know, it's usually, you know, it's like grannies and giraffes or something.  Just, like, the weirdest stuff would be.  Grannies and giraffes.  I don't know.  I just came up with that.  I've seen that.  I know that one.  That's probably not.  I like ankle deep.  Ankle deep, that is a term I would imagine is already spoken for.  It's not.  It's not?  No.  You can go to that yourself?  Yeah.  Ankle deep.  You probably could have won this contest if you were eligible. 
[03:27:30]  Yeah, so these people create their own piece of 21st century real estate by coming up.  Oh, I just had it.  I clicked off of it to show you.  There you go.  Spillingmyjizz.com.  Wow.  Get started.  Is this your domain name?  Let's turn it into a website.  Now it's up.  You know what?  The winner is, what we should do is, with the winner, is we should put the website up  for them and put content on it.  That's really cool.  I can't put a bunch of guys ejaculating. 
[03:28:00]  That's a lot of work, though.  Not really.  You just put, like, four photos up and say, go look at it.  We put it up.  Okay.  A lot of work for who?  We just cut your workload in half.  You could have, what if you had your listeners send in photos of things that look like they  could be jizz being spilled or having been spilled and them going like, uh-oh, look what  I spilled.  Oh, my God.  Will Sasso, you are so smart.  Money.  You're money.  And it looks like it's jizz, but it's completely G-rated.  Okay.  You have to email these at jmore.com.  I cannot take these on Twitter because I won't be able to save them. 
[03:28:30]  There you go.  So, I'm going to say the finalists are, was it letting, letting my jizz, yeah, spilling  my jizz.com.  Okay.  From Nicole Hadley, right?  Yeah.  And then I'm going to say no biting man is just a no-brainer, man.  It is, man.  Now, that is a website where I need a whole bunch of people taking pictures of people biting  one another.  It could be children.  No biting man.  No biting man. 
[03:29:00]  No biting man.  And if you get a picture of Barry Katz superimposed, like telling somebody about to bite him, no  biting man.  Then you could really make a meme out of it.  Or you could take pre-existing pictures from the internet of people who have injuries, okay?  It's kind of a little messed up, but people, there's so many pictures on the internet of  people who have injuries, some of them bloody, and you superimpose, you crop in Barry Katz  with the word bubble.  No biting man.  Like that injury came from a bite.  Yeah.  Every injury came from a bite. 
[03:29:30]  It could even be like, you know, a giant car crash and just Barry Katz in the corner  with a word bubble, no biting man.  It could be a porcupine or a dog that has porcupine quills in its mouth.  Yeah.  How did nobody put that one together?  No biting man.  How about this?  Barry Katz is the referee in a title fight, giving finals to two guys right when they touch  gloves.  Yeah.  And just Barry's last instructions.  No biting man.  No biting man.  I expect a fair fight.  Yeah.  No biting man.  Like he was there with the-  All right.  Maddy needs a-  Go ahead.  No, I was going to say he was there with Tyson versus Holyfield. 
[03:30:00]  He was instead of Mills Lane.  I like that because it's timely.  Maddy needs a mic.  That's it.  Barry can do the third prize winner.  Barry can sit there and oversee the process of your fellatio.  JJ, when you're blowing this lady's neighbor, which personally I would have had you done  dancing with the stars or something before we settled on blowing strangers, but this  is definitely a holy shit moment.  And then he can say before you start. 
[03:30:30]  Just remember when you're blowing this guy, no biting man.  There you go.  Thank you.  Be undeniable.  All right.  Finalists are spillingmyjizz.com.  You have to send us photos at jaymoore.com of things that look like a man ejaculating but  are not.  Yeah.  Or having just ejaculated.  Either in mid-ejaculation or having just ejaculated.  Example.  Or what about right before ejaculation?  Just people's weird face?  Then it'll just be faces. 
[03:31:00]  Yeah, you can go with that.  No, we don't want that.  Warhol did a whole movie, 10 minutes, just a picture of a guy's face jacking off.  Yeah.  I think it's more interesting to come up with creative ways to show the post-jizz spillage.  Okay.  Just as someone holding a bathroom cock that's exploded and it's all over the kitchen.  What's a bathroom cock?  Well, you know the bathroom cocking.  A cock.  Cock.  Yeah.  Cawking gun.  Yeah, cock.  I didn't know you had cocks spread across your house.  Well, yeah, no.  I don't have a kitchen cock.  Yeah, I got a different cock for each room. 
[03:31:30]  Hey, honey, I got a case of bathroom cock.  Can we go to the espresso machine and grab my espresso cock?  I need a little one.  Yeah.  Spillingmyjizz.com.  NoBitingMan.com.  Congratulations, Nicole Hadley.  And congratulations to Stuart Rosenthal.  Those are your finalists.  Now, the winner will be determined.  There's no third prize.  See that?  Good.  I don't get to blow anybody.  All right.  Nicole Hadley, congratulations.  Stuart Rosenthal, congratulations.  This is the GoDaddy.com contest. 
[03:32:00]  You click the GoDaddy banner at JayMoore.com if you wish to continue this shenanigans.  But it's been a lot of fun.  GoDaddy made it fun.  That's cool.  But we need pictures of things that look like somebody in the process of or recently having  just completed spilling my jizz all over the place.  But it can't be real jizz.  No.  It needs to be.  If it's that, then Nicole Hadley loses automatically.  Stuart, don't do it.  Stuart Rosenthal, NoBitingMan.  And pictures of Barry Katz superimposed instructing people to stop biting them for all, in the 
[03:32:30]  name of all things holy.  So your pro wrestling appearances, did you get hurt?  No.  No.  Those guys are amazing.  I've done it a few times.  I've never been hurt.  I had a full match with Bret Hart.  Yeah.  I wanted to talk to you about the Bret Hart match.  Yeah.  Now, how often do you practice?  No, you don't.  You don't.  You don't.  How do you have a full match?  He's grabbing the clinch.  You go, I'm going to turn around over my head.  Pretty much.  He would just go, like, you know, we went out there in the afternoon.  He's like, you know, we go out in the afternoon, you know, run around the ring, you know, get 
[03:33:00]  a feel for it.  Was the Calgary Saddle Dome?  No, it was in, we were in Tampa.  Ooh.  I don't know why.  And he.  That's awesome.  It is pretty awesome.  And it's a wrestling town, Tampa.  And, yeah, and we went out there.  That too.  Yeah, we went out in the afternoon.  He's like, oh, you know, you've seen this stuff on TV.  You know, you're athletic.  You played football.  You could do it.  I was like, you've got to be joking.  He's like, don't do anything without me.  Guiding you to do it.  That was the rule.  He's like, if you're on the ground, if I've hit you, you're on the ground. 
[03:33:30]  Wait, I'll pick you up.  Like, never do anything.  He's like, I'll lead the dance the whole time.  And he did.  And we did stuff that we didn't rehearse.  We didn't rehearse anything.  Did you get any shots in on him?  No.  No, actually, I'm happy you asked that because myself and, well, okay, like for anybody who's listening, which is, again, anyone but the three of us.  Yes.  We've established that.  We're listening to that.  We are also listening.  We're listening right now.  We're listening right now.  We're from the future.  We did this thing.  It was sort of like the Jerry Lawler, Andy Kaufman thing in the 70s and 80s to where we set up a feud between myself and Bret the Hitman Hart. 
[03:34:00]  He came on Mad TV.  He attacked me, blah, blah, blah.  We set that up a year before with something I did to him.  And a lot of people bought it and thought it was real.  Oh, wait.  I should say, because it's totally real.  It is real.  Yeah, it's completely real.  Real to me, damn it.  It's still real to me, damn it.  Oh, I love that guy.  And so it culminated in this match.  So there we are on their Monday night show, and we're down there, and blah, blah, blah, and we're in Tampa. 
[03:34:30]  And we do this match.  And myself and a writer-producer at Mad TV named Brian Hart, who also, you know, I grew up wrestling, watching wrestling, rather, and Brian, same deal.  And we both love Bret Hart.  And we flew in, and we came up with this idea to where when Bret asked us, you know, you want to get a shot in, like a cheap shot or something?  We said no.  Because any time you see a quote-unquote celebrity guest or someone from entertainment coming into wrestling, they always get a shot in. 
[03:35:00]  Jay Leno putting Hulk Hogan in an arm bar.  I'm not buying it.  It's stupid.  If we're supposed to buy that these are these mega-athletes, these monsters that are going at each other, and these guys are ridiculous athletes.  But Jay Leno's a monster of late night.  Oh, that's true.  Oh, wait.  Maybe that's why they were trying to do that.  Oh, yeah.  It was his power of late night.  Oh, shit.  When you get these entertainers in there, they get one in on the wrestlers?  That makes no sense.  So Bret's like, you want to do it?  And we're like, no. 
[03:35:30]  You kick my ass the whole time.  I don't get a shot in.  You leisurely beat the shit out of me.  How long is the segment?  He's like, commercial to commercial, eight minutes.  It's about a five and a half minute, six minute match.  Okay, cool.  You just smack the snot out of me the whole time.  And he kind of giggled.  He said, okay, cool.  And that's the way it should go.  Anytime someone comes on their show.  I hate that as someone who watches, has watched that stuff.  And you didn't get hurt at all.  Not at all.  But isn't it weird in Tampa?  Now you're leaving the ring. 
[03:36:00]  Right.  And people are like, you suck.  I'm so glad you got beat.  Like, they think you really suck at work.  Yeah, and you're selling it.  You're going up the ramp.  Two refs, you know, holding you up.  And you're making your way up the ramp.  You're wincing and limping and, you know.  You're putting exploded all over the place.  You're putting exploded all over the place.  Thank goodness I was wearing black shorts, you know.  A singlet.  But no, I went out to the parking lot and was like, what the heck?  And a singlet underneath there.  More for me, you know, because I just want to, I want it tight.  You know, I want my junk tight.  I want to be in a, sometimes anytime I do something active, I put on a rope diaper first and I twist 
[03:36:30]  my stuff in there.  And then I go for the run on the beach, you know.  Or active things.  Well, it just sort of feels good.  Yeah.  You know, it just sort of feels good.  Pain.  That sort of pain.  Genital pain.  And that'll make you run faster.  It will make you run faster.  I gotta get home and take this rope diaper.  I gotta get this thing off and I can't do it in the middle of the beach in public.  I need to be alone.  I need to at least be in my automobile to relieve myself of the genital pressure that this rope  diaper's providing.  But no, he didn't hurt me at all.  And he's got me in the corner.  He's stomping me in the corner. 
[03:37:00]  You know, he's, they call him the excellence of execution and he, you know, I think that  probably should be an inside term because he's just, he's booting me in the chest.  It looks like he's booting me as hard as I can.  And it's like a feather.  It was unbelievable.  And him, Steve Austin, you know, Kane I've done stuff with.  All these guys are like, they're, they're, they're, they're not just, uh, incredible  athletes and entertainers.  They're like, they're like masters of physics or something like they understand exactly where 
[03:37:30]  to put a guy to not hurt him, how to hit him, to not hurt him.  And it's, it's pretty unbelievable.  How do you think guys right now listening to this, uh, you know, going to pro wrestling  school, they're on their like third year WWE school and they're being milked through the  system, trying to be, make a name for themselves.  Uh, and Bret Hart goes, you've seen it on TV, right?  You can do it.  Yeah.  Can you imagine?  Well, I mean, they're doing, they have to provide those guys going through school and  learning how to do it, have to eventually hopefully, you know, get to a place to where 
[03:38:00]  they're doing what Brett's doing, leading a match.  You know what I mean?  Is Bret Hart the only white guy with a jerry curl?  Uh, who else is a white guy with a jerry curl?  Very jerry curl looking man.  Very jerry curl looking guy.  Is he greasy or crunchy?  I think it's, I think it's more wet, just wet.  Scrunchy.  Not scrunchy, not crunchy.  It's definitely not dry.  I think Richard Marks, you remember him?  If they wet his hair down, he'd have a nice jerry curl.  Yeah, but that's the thing.  You have to wet his hair down.  Bret Hart just walks in with a full jerry curl.  No, it's wet though.  Bret Hart is one of the only guys who would not, like, sweat much. 
[03:38:30]  You watch him have a match.  By the end of it, his hair is frizzy.  Well, yeah, he's fighting you.  He's not, you know.  No, when his big matches in, like, the 90s, by the end of the match, his hair is dry and  frizzy.  Oh.  It's a reverse thing.  Five seasons, you played Derek Wakalok in the Canadian drama Madison.  You're really going back.  You're going back a while, yeah.  Five seasons in Canada.  What's that like?  Is that a pilot here in L.A.?  Yeah, well, you'd say, you'd get paid about as much as a pilot here in L.A. 
[03:39:00]  Hey, I'm talking.  Um, uh, yeah, no, I did that when I was a kid, teenager.  Derek Wakaluk.  Derek Wakaluk.  What did I say?  Yeah, same.  I don't know.  Who cares, right?  Isn't it weird whenever you ask somebody their name and they just repeat their name back  to you and you don't know if they're correcting you?  Yeah.  You go like, Caroline?  Caroline.  Yeah.  Caroline?  Caroline.  Yeah.  Caroline?  Caroline.  And you're like, is it fucking Caroline?  Yeah.  Daryl.  Daryl.  Daryl.  What's your name?  Daryl. 
[03:39:30]  Daryl.  Daryl.  Robert.  Daryl.  Daryl.  Daryl.  Mike.  Huh?  Mike?  Daryl.  No, I did not.  Are you having a stroke?  Yes, I am.  What's your name?  George.  Mike.  Daryl Mike.  Five seasons.  That's a long time to be on TV.  How old were you doing Canadian?  I think I started that show when I was 17.  So you've been in the business a long ass time.  Yeah, I started working professionally when I was 15.  I was lucky.  Was that your first gig?  No, that was not my first gig.  That show was not my first gig.  What was your first gig for Tim Hortons? 
[03:40:00]  My first gig was actually a show.  It was a Canadian show, the lead of which actually recently passed away, God rest his soul.  When people die.  People die.  Look at me.  I'm alive.  Hey, look what I'm doing.  I'm getting up in the morning and I'm living on this earthly plane of existence.  The Canadians came with me?  Yeah.  I'll be alive later.  He's fucking dead. 
[03:40:30]  He's fucking dead.  He's supposed to take me to a game.  Hey, what happened?  How come he didn't take you to the game?  Did life leave his earthly carriage?  Fucking loser.  It's like, way to go, not living anymore guy.  Way to go.  Right?  Burn.  Total burn.  Burn.  Total burnage, man.  Fucking burn his shit out.  Oh, fucking burn that fucking dude.  Hey, I'm not living anymore.  I'm the guy Will Sass is talking about.  You may recognize me from my tombstone.  You might recognize me from any time before last Tuesday when I up and died. 
[03:41:00]  Hey, I don't know if you ever come in the basement of my house.  That's really creepy because I bang on the pipes and freak you out.  Because I'm dead.  Yeah.  Hey.  And I'm not happy because I haven't moved on.  Hey, I had no idea I was going to die.  So my drawers and shit and desk are full of all sorts of incriminating stuff.  And I have a hard drive without any password on it.  So go ahead and look at the flinking terabyte of porn I have.  Letmagespill.com.  I just won a contest on Jay Moore's podcast. 
[03:41:30]  Then I fucking died.  And my whole family knows I'm a miscreant.  That really is the key to life.  You know?  Yeah.  Don't die after you do something like that.  If you're planning something shitty.  You love the original in-laws?  Peter Falk.  Oh, it's been a while since I've seen it.  Yeah.  When Peter Falk is at – I'm going back to the importance of staying alive discussion.  It's very important.  Peter Falk is at a bar waiting for something to happen.  And David Pamer is his cab driver. 
[03:42:00]  And he goes, what do you do for a living?  He goes, me?  I'm in the CIA.  And he goes, you get out of here, man.  And he goes, oh, I'm the classic agency type, compact, low to the ground, strong.  Are you interested in joining?  The benefits are terrific.  The key is to not get killed.  That really is the key to enjoying the benefits.  That's amazing.  It's like the best movie of all time.  Oh, that's funny.  The key is to not get killed.  That's really the trick to enjoying you, man.  That's a wonderful thing to share.  And you know what?  Speaking of –  I couldn't get his name out earlier. 
[03:42:30]  Sorry.  You know, you and I – the last time I was here, we did a two-man Brian Callen impersonation.  You and I should put this out there to your audience, that if you have a family member  or a loved one pass away, myself and Jay Moore will eulogize your loved one in the way that  we just did.  Mock them.  Mock them, tag team style.  We'll go up at the funeral and just go, oh, Uncle Stan's dead.  Hey, Uncle Stan.  You know what?  If my eyes slip open, it'll freak everybody out. 
[03:43:00]  So they have to sew them shut.  Hey, Uncle Stan.  There's a team of people making sure my eyes don't open during the funeral because I'm  so fucking inconsiderate.  I can't keep my eyes open during the funeral.  I'm going to bring a guy in here and just sew me, sew me across my eyes.  Do you like my makeup?  I'm wearing makeup, fag.  Hey, Uncle Stan, you fag.  Hey, look at this.  I'm dropping my balls in Uncle Stan's dead mouth and he likes it because he's a dead gay  uncle.  And I like it because it's cold and it's refreshing. 
[03:43:30]  This is the only time I've ever had my balls in someone's mouth and not had them feel  warm.  And my nuts are hot.  Oh, wow.  This is like, oh, this is the only time I've ever ejaculated and not enjoyed it.  Goodbye, everybody.  I'm sure he's a good man.  So good that he fucking died.  Yeah, way to die, Uncle Stan's dead.  You know what?  This is a pretty idea.  It's a good idea.  Let us come to a funeral.  We'll come to a funeral.  I want to shovel the snow myself.  That's the culinary.  I want to shovel the snow myself. 
[03:44:00]  Hey, honey, why don't you get the kid from the neighborhood?  He's got a snowblower.  Nonsense.  I don't want to put $10 out of my pocket.  I'll do it myself.  Hey, I ate expired pain medication.  That's just the big, that's just big farm telling you not to do that because they want  you to buy new shit.  Do you guys want to go whitewater ramp, dude?  Hey, we're in Mexico.  Let's go ziplining even though we didn't buy travel insurance.  Rocks? 
[03:44:30]  I'm never going ziplining.  Why?  I want to go ziplining so bad.  Because I'm like.  I've done it in Mexico, actually, yeah.  Because I'm.  You have in Mexico?  I have done it in Mexico.  Did you have traveler's insurance?  Traveler's insurance.  Yeah.  There's no insurance.  I don't even have a driver's license.  They don't offer it in Mexico.  No, they don't.  Where were you?  Were you in, I want to guess where you were.  You were on the.  Hold on.  Take your time on this one.  I'll really take this.  It'll be really fun for the listener.  Were you in, you were on the Mayan Riviera.  Yes.  And you were in, what's it starts with an X? 
[03:45:00]  Close.  One place where it's a Z or an X or something.  I know what you're talking about, but it wasn't there.  It wasn't there.  It was a Yucatan Peninsula.  It was, I know what you're talking about.  Yeah.  The Exalt.  Yeah.  You can't get away from this ziplining shit over there.  They want you to zipline.  Isn't it a Grateful Dead album, that town?  Are you kidding?  Which?  Zoc.  You see it on the back of a pickup truck.  It starts with an X and it ends with an X.  It's almost a palindrome.  Oh, the one.  You're not talking about the street on the way, that exit on the way out to Vegas, are  you? 
[03:45:30]  Zizix?  Zizix Road.  I'm talking about a Mexican town.  It starts with an X.  Zuzl.  Zuzza.  It's Zuz.  Oh, fucko.  Zuz.  Zuz.  Zuz.  Zuz.  Let me tell our friend Will Sasso about your travels to Mexico when the hurricane hit.  I think that's very interesting.  Not really.  Oh, yeah, but that was the same trip that I went ziplining.  I went there with my girlfriend, my ex, and we got trapped in a hurricane, class 5 hurricane.  And I was so coked out of my mind that I thought it was a good idea to board up the room with makeshift objects. 
[03:46:00]  So I went to the closet, and I stole tape and bottles and things that really wouldn't help at all in a hurricane.  Just provide more shrapnel.  Just more shit.  And I stole a bunch of it, just railed out drunk, brought it in the room, and I taped the whole fucking room with duct tape.  Taped us in, pulled the mattress off the bed, put it against the balcony.  Oh, my goodness.  I just strung tape from the ceiling to the lamps.  Just shit that didn't even make any sense.  Just like John Nash, beautiful mind.  Like, the pattern made sense to him. 
[03:46:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'll connect the lamp to the door.  And my girlfriend's just in the bathroom crying for 12 hours while the hurricane hits.  I think now would be a great time in the podcast to just read every Mexican city that starts with an X.  Yes, yes, yes.  It starts with an X?  Do you know how many there are?  Man, you have a list there?  How many?  Look how many there are.  That's like 100.  Yeah, we're never going to find it.  People are going to start tweeting it out.  It's one, God, I can't believe.  It's on the back of so many trucks all over the place. 
[03:47:00]  The one you see out here a lot is Oaxaca, but that's not it.  How do you spell that?  It starts with an O.  You're a jerk.  Man, Spanish.  No, but when I did...  Were you in...  When I did the ziplining, I actually got stuck.  We got stuck on the zipline, and then a dude had to come out and get us off, unhitch us.  How does he come out on stilts?  No, he comes out on the zipline also.  He came out, he ziplined out.  Hey, man!  Now we got two people hanging on there.  He had to attach my safety cord to his cord, and then... 
[03:47:30]  Hey, fool, you're stuck on the zipline, man.  Hey, man.  For some reason, we make him an Inland Empire cholo.  Hey, fool, what's up, fool?  Hey, man, you got stuck on that...  He was so high, he was never in Mexico.  He just went to Ontario, California.  He was outside Fontana Raceway.  That's why that guy was wearing jorts and a Raiders hat.  He was holding a fucking clothesline in his hand.  And he stole from someone's yard.  That's how high he was.  He's like, I'm stuck.  Hey, fool, we got to go get this guy, fool. 
[03:48:00]  Yo, he's hanging off the tree with a cord hanger, man.  You might be lost, Holmes.  Yeah.  Hey, fool, what's that you from, fool?  Hey, clothesline.  Why do you take my mom's clothesline, dog?  We got to let the sheets dry.  I got to let the sheets dry.  I got to let the sheets dry.  Why in scary movies, there are always sheets drying?  Oh, good point.  Why is that?  It's always white sheets.  Really?  That's so easy.  Tell me.  You think you're so great.  Tell me why.  You guys, all my medications are just cute. 
[03:48:30]  You think you're so great.  It's because they wave around and people can hide behind them and it's very spooky.  Oh, I know that.  I can't finish.  I can't finish.  What is this?  I'm sorry, sweetie.  Lethargic argument winner.  I'm sorry.  No, it's like way too many fucking prescription pills and they all hit me at the same time,  but I'm in a way more argument because I'm a little manic, even though I'm like buried  under all my big pharma.  So it's like a lot of things like waving around and flapping around.  You're going to hide behind all of them.  His question was, why are they in movies? 
[03:49:00]  It's like horror movies because you could be hiding behind all the sheets all the time  and for the movie makers, it provides depth because there's like three rows of sheets.  You never know.  It's just kind of a cliche.  You get through one line.  Look, you need a shower curtain.  That's just one line of defense.  Well, none of them are really a line of defense.  I mean, if you think so.  Not a line of defense, but just like a barrier between the monster and the scary things that  are happening.  Man, all right.  Okay.  That's why you don't have a horror movie and you go like, oh my God, I'm in an empty parking  lot.  I'm so scared because there's nothing there. 
[03:49:30]  How come there's always a cat in a horror movie?  Every horror movie, the guy's like, let me close this window.  Yeah.  Dogs are not scary.  Every dog is friendly.  Every dog lets you know like, hey man.  Yes.  Hey fool.  That's going to be my dog voice.  It's the same as the guy from San Bernardino.  Hey fool, this place is haunted, yo.  Yeah, it's haunted, yo.  Hey, man.  Hey, dog. 
[03:50:00]  Hey, fool.  Shut up, dog.  What's that you from, man?  Hey, dog.  Hey, your dog is out.  Hey, check out my Raiders collar.  Hey, your dog is out.  Your dog is acting dumb, man.  No, my God.  He won't stop barking.  That's because something bad is coming, fool.  We have the same voice also.  That's right.  The Chiefs are coming up to Oakland to beat the Raiders.  Now, fuck that, fool.  Fuck that.  If you don't come in our house and play like that, fuck that shit.  Everyone has.  Now, fuck that, they haven't.  Not this year.  We got that new guy.  Who's that new guy?  Do you have a dog?  No, I don't.  Do you want a dog? 
[03:50:30]  I do want a dog.  You'd be a great dad.  Do you want kids?  I do want kids.  You'd be a great dad.  Just go knock somebody out.  You know, I'm 38 years old, and over the past couple years, I've mused about just blowing  it in a chick if she's just kind of really nice and smart.  Why wouldn't you?  Well, I think you might just go, hey, look, I'm a Catholic.  This can't happen.  Like, if she wants to, like, I don't think I should keep the baby.  You'd be like, whoa.  Yeah.  Whoa.  The only way for you, this is what I would say, I'd say, as a God-fearing man, the only 
[03:51:00]  way for you to kill my baby is for you to go with it.  Sorry.  This has been more stories.  That'd be the best ending of all time, but I can't.  That wouldn't be the best ending ever?  It would have been, but I can't.  It's too brutal.  What, honey?  No, no, no, because I want to talk to Will about a couple more things about dogs.  Yeah.  You never had dogs?  No.  All my meds kicked in.  I'm all fucking hazy, bro.  Sat on my reading glasses right before we started. 
[03:51:30]  That put me in tailspin.  What?  Huh?  Huh?  You got married before you had kids, right?  The first time, and then the second time, the right one, I had my son, who was the best  man at my wedding, and then we made a second one with the love of my life.  Oh, that's great.  That's great.  So why do you ever think, when you meet girls, are you like the opposite?  Most guys are like, didn't she talk about kids, and I tap out?  No.  Are you the guy that's like sweet? 
[03:52:00]  Like, when you go on a date, you're like, I hope she brings up kids.  I don't hope she brings up kids.  Because she's mulatto, and we're going to have super gorgeous kids.  My blue eyes and her cocoa skin.  You look like Rick Fox.  Yeah, it looks like Rick Fox.  It'd be smooth sailing for that kid.  No kidding.  Man, Rick Fox could do whatever the fuck he wants.  Still.  Still.  No, it's not necessarily the first date, but I was with a girl a couple years ago, and  she said something interesting.  She was talking about a fight that a girlfriend of hers was having.  And here I am.  I'm dating this girl. 
[03:52:30]  We're in love at this point.  And I'm in my mid-30s at this point.  I think she was 30.  And she was talking about a fight that her girlfriend had.  She goes, oh, my girlfriend had this fight because blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  And her boyfriend brought up, maybe someday if we get married, then so on and so forth.  And my ex's contention was, why the heck is this guy bringing up marriage?  And what she said was, that has nothing to do with dating.  And I paused and I said, it has everything to do with dating. 
[03:53:00]  Are you crazy?  And, you know, of course, this girl was on her path, and we ended up not together.  And, you know, I don't know if she's...  That girl's name was Tiffany Amber Thiessen.  Tiffany Amber Thiessen, ladies and gentlemen.  So just to let you know where her priorities lie.  No, you know, I mean, and on her, not to sound like a weirdo, but, you know, her journey,  maybe she's at the point where she's like, I want to get married.  Now, I'm not saying I want to get married.  That's a priority.  The priority is the person you're with.  But I think a lot of times in a dynamic place, in a metropolitan city like L.A., a girl can go, 
[03:53:30]  oh, I just want to date and hang around.  And, you know, the same person said to me once, oh, I remember where I was when I met you.  I was just dating a bunch of guys and just satisfied to let them take me out.  And, you know, kind of finishing the night going, eh, I got a better life than him.  I don't care about that guy so much.  And I kind of want to bang that guy, blah, blah, blah, blah.  And just spreading it around.  And then I met you, and you had an impact on me, and I really liked you a lot, and blah, blah, blah. 
[03:54:00]  And I'm going, that's kind of what you brought in, though.  She was a who.  She was a who.  Isn't it also the parenthetical of that entire conversation is,  until I meet the person I actually want to have kids with?  Yes, absolutely.  Not you.  Right, absolutely.  That's what she's saying.  If I was the person that she wanted to get married to someday.  If you were Rick Fox, that would be a different story.  She's been her eighth kid.  Right.  She's living in a shoe.  Right.  And if, to me, that person was someone that I wanted to spend my life with, 
[03:54:30]  I wouldn't have even been in there.  Somewhere subconsciously, I picked, you know, it's weird, but it's weird here in L.A.  I mean, you know, you've been married for a while.  Do you pick the same weird chick over and over again?  I don't pick the same weird chick over and over again.  I do pick some weird chicks, though.  Friends of the show.
