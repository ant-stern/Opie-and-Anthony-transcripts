<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast from WBCN in Boston was a chaotic and highly offensive spectacle featuring Opie, Anthony, and James Norton. The show opened with self-deprecating insults, describing themselves as "vile, despicable human beings" and "retards," followed by a recounting of a wild cab ride to the studio.  They then promoted their "ONA Traveling Virus" comedy tour, featuring Bob Saget, Robert Kelly, Bill Burr, and others, highlighting the tour's eccentric elements, including a “petting zoo.”

A large portion of the show focused on their feud with Whoopi Goldberg, stemming from their harsh criticism of her new radio show.  They played clips of her show and dissected them, leading to a media firestorm.  The unexpected highlight was Whoopi Goldberg’s surprise in-studio appearance on their XM satellite radio show, which diffused the tension.  They extensively discussed her visit, her subsequent apology on her own show, and the resulting media coverage, including altered photos from the New York Daily News that removed nude celebrity pictures from the background of a photo taken with Whoopi.  The hosts also discussed their perceived cowardice in their response to Whoopi’s visit, contrasting their reaction to her with their past interactions with “pests,” aggressive listeners who had confronted Whoopi.

The show veered into various other topics, including their Boston experiences (a hotel room encounter with drunk commercial producers, a stolen room service platter), their sleep habits, a negative review of their “Lucky Louie” show, and commentary on Mel Gibson's anti-Semitic remarks.  John Valby, a comedic musician, performed a set of explicit songs, prompting discussion about broadcast restrictions between terrestrial and XM radio.  This segment also included a brief interaction with Cubby Bryant, Whoopi Goldberg's co-host.  A phone call to Ralphie May, scheduled to perform the next day on the tour, was plagued by technical difficulties.

The broadcast took an unexpected turn with an impromptu live broadcast from an IHOP.  The hosts, along with Jimmy, Sonny Farrelly, and a "Drown the Clown" from their tour, engaged in offensive jokes targeting the IHOP staff and customers.  They announced their intention to "dine and dash." The clown performed an offensive improvised version of "Twas the Night Before Christmas," and Kenny performed a bizarre skit.  John Valby called in to perform more crude songs.  The broadcast switched between WBCN and XM to test acceptable language.  The hosts discussed a "strip bus" used for a bar crawl and received an unexpected call from Brother Joe, whose U2 tribute band had received promotion from the show.

Back at WBCN, they recounted their IHOP antics, with Anthony staging a “Pulp Fiction”-style robbery. They detailed the stripper bus and promised photos on their website.  They thanked WBCN for having them on the air and discussed the impact on their bonus potential.  Club Soda Kenny promoted their upcoming Worcester show, mentioning the "petting zoo with freaks" and Andrew Dice Clay’s (rebranded as "Andrew Dice Gay") appearance.  Dice Clay's performance involved extremely vulgar and sexually explicit language, including homophobic slurs and improvised, sexually charged rhymes.  The show concluded with further crude jokes, thanks to WBCN staff, specifically Dave Wellington, and a mention of Jimmy Norton’s appearance on *Lucky Louie*.  The broadcast throughout was marked by numerous technical difficulties, including microphone issues and problems connecting a computer for PalTalk, low turnout for their free IHOP breakfast promotion at WBCN, and  consistent use of vulgar and offensive language.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show on XM202 featuring Opie, Anthony, and James Norton. 
[00:00:30]  They are the most vile, despicable human beings in the country. Creeps, ankle biters.  Obviously, the strength is their ability to turn mistruth into something people would believe.  Wow, how long is this guy going to continue to babble and say nothing?  All day long.  Shut up.  All right, here we go.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show.  It's worse than I imagined.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  We are a bunch of dopes. 
[00:01:00]  I think we're rude.  And we're probably pushing 20 arrests because of this radio show.  Out of touch, corn balls, three retards.  We have the effect of talent all PM.  Yeep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.  Yeep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.  Opie.  I could have been a model.  Anthony.  I'm dead.  James Norton.  I like yogurt.  Robert Reed.  But enough of this palaver. 
[00:01:30]  Let's get the show on the road.  Can you tell we're broadcasting from a different place than usual?  We prepared for that moment for about an hour.  And we missed our cue.  Went off without a hitch.  Yeah, right.  That was the equivalent of foam coming off the fuel tank and hitting the wing.  That's how these radio shows work. 
[00:02:00]  It's the same thing, the chain of events that happens, yet it's a little less catastrophic.  You just get a little blast of music in your ears this early.  Hi.  Good morning.  How's everyone's mic sound?  What?  Really?  Yeah, it's just different.  Every time you broadcast from somewhere new, it sounds a little different.  So you've got to get used to it.  And I'll be used to it by about 11.05. 
[00:02:30]  I'll get used to the mic sound.  All right.  Good morning.  Is it?  And welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  Yes.  It has spread to Boston.  Wow.  They're so excited.  I know.  If you're in the studio, you've got to give us some energy.  Please.  Whoa.  Come on.  A little energy.  Opie, we're supposed to have the energy.  Everyone else just says, go screw yourself.  It's too early.  What, they're just going to stare at us? 
[00:03:00]  Yeah.  Oh, that's great.  And then we've got people in this room looking.  There's another studio, and there's glass that we can barely see through.  I feel like I'm part of a homicide investigation, and they're just leaving the room and see what  they say to each other.  I see a silhouette of an awful looking body.  It's got to be Sonny Pirelli.  Wow.  You're good, right?  That is.  I didn't see a silhouette, but I'm a comic book guy from The Simpsons.  I've seen that awful body so many times, I could tell that it's Sonny Pirelli, and  I, I, I, it's just a silhouette. 
[00:03:30]  Yeah.  Good morning, Jimmy.  Where's his mic on?  Is your mic on?  How about now?  Oh, that's much better.  That's better.  Oh, no.  I got some.  He's not.  He's not.  Oh, boy.  He's number, what, three?  I can do it.  All right.  There you go.  Am I better?  Jimmy's two.  Jimmy's two.  Just think, he's easy, number two, and we know, you know.  Oh, wait.  Just keep number two.  No, no, no, he likes number one. 
[00:04:00]  Well, one is his favorite.  One is, one is my favorite, but two, you don't embarrass somebody.  Two is very acceptable, though.  Yeah, we're broadcasting live from WBCN.  It has been a long time because, uh.  It's not the same studio.  Uh, I don't remember it looking this way.  It's not the same studio.  There's, um, there's no Oedipus anymore.  No.  There's no clam chowder.  No.  And we're in the middle of, I think, I think it's Brighton.  I think. 
[00:04:30]  I had the most horrific cab ride here following you.  It was like the chase scene out of Bullet.  You had the greatest line, by the way.  We had a car service, but car services stink.  They're really bad.  We hate them.  And for how bad they are, even in New York, worse in Boston.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And Club Soda Candy.  I just walk out of the hotel, and I see you guys on the sidewalk.  He's agitated.  And he's yelling and screaming.  I'm like, what could have possibly happened?  It's only like 4.45. 
[00:05:00]  Yeah.  Like 4.45 in the morning.  It's still pitch black.  It's nighttime out.  All the lights, the traffic lights, are still in blink mode.  Like, you could just drive however you want.  There's no more light.  Ah, it's Grand Theft Auto.  Yeah, Grand Theft Auto in that early morning setting.  Grand Theft Auto rules.  Yeah.  That's the rule that you're in.  You don't have to stop or anything.  But Kenny was just yelling into a phone, what?  It was supposed to be here.  We were supposed to have a car come and pick us up, but I couldn't.  So we had to get a couple of cabs.  Yeah. 
[00:05:30]  Which is fun, because no cab driver knew where the studio was.  Didn't even know the street that it was on.  BCN doesn't even know where the studio is.  All I know is when we came in, I heard like this sound, and I turn around behind me,  and this huge gate starts locking down like we're in prison.  I thought I was on, I'm going to go old school.  I thought I was part of a siphon filter mission.  When that gate opened, I was going into enemy territory.  Were you looking to disable cameras?  Yeah, exactly. 
[00:06:00]  Our whole lives are a video game at this point.  Yeah.  And he was all mad.  Well, you had the greatest line, because we got here.  I was scared for my life, because we're tooling down Stero Drive.  Is that where we were, Stero Drive?  Because I had no idea.  And it's a windy road, and my cab, the lead cab, had no problem taking these turns at like 70 miles an hour.  Yeah.  You were feeling the G's.  My cab driver had to follow yours, because he didn't know how to get here. 
[00:06:30]  Right, and the point I'm going to make is now, when we got further outside Boston, there were real red lights.  In the city, they were blinking.  It was Grand Theft Auto rules.  Yeah.  But outside the city, they were working.  What the hell was that?  They were working, and my cab driver, the lead cab, is going through the red lights.  Yeah.  So when we finally got to BCN, we'd get out of our cab all freaked out, like, holy crap, you see him going through all the red lights, and that's when you...  Yeah.  I know.  I said, yeah, we were following you, and we didn't stop. 
[00:07:00]  So for all the red lights he was going through, we were going through them about a second later.  And it was a harrowing drive, going around corners, yeah, like 70 miles an hour, because you couldn't lose them, because the guy didn't know how to get here, my cab driver.  Yours did, but...  Not really.  He didn't know the follow, someone's following you rules.  When someone's following me, I drive like a complete ass.  I drive real slow, I make sure, I'm always looking in my mirror to make sure they're on our tail. 
[00:07:30]  Oh, Kenny.  Hi, Club Soda Kenny.  I just want to...  I don't know how that...  Opie, the mic isn't working.  Number one.  Number one.  You missed your catchphrase.  I know, but why would it?  Why would the mic work?  I just wanted to say that our cab driver...  Yeah.  ...usually has a police car following him, that's why he was driving like that.  Okay, I think I understand now.  Yeah, he was very used to driving like that. 
[00:08:00]  He's used to fleeing.  It was fun, because when we did finally get here, just by natural reflex, he flung his  door open, running into the woods.  I'm like, hey, we got to pay you.  But BCN hooked us up nice, man.  There's what, steak and egg whites out there?  There's lobster?  Yes.  Yeah, it's really...  The Palm Restaurant.  The Palm.  Yeah, they went all out.  Very, very good.  Palm Restaurant, steak, eggs, and lobster, fresh fruit.  I think they'll grab something.  Thanks to the Palm Restaurant at the Westin Copley Place for breakfast today. 
[00:08:30]  The Palm, the perfect place to celebrate.  That was natural right off the top of your head.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Club Soda Kenny, you know the first part of your name?  What is it?  The Club Soda will be here forthwith.  Thank you.  You know I can't live without.  How many bottles did you pull out of the back of my vehicle when you helped clean out my  Escalade yesterday?  Clowns.  Like a clown car.  Of Club Soda bottles.  All I know is that Kenny was doing you a favor yesterday, and at the last second you go, 
[00:09:00]  oh, by the way, can you take all the Club Soda bottles out of my car?  How many were there?  It filled up a small dumpster.  Yeah.  Are you kidding?  As I make turns, I hear them all just go, clunk, clunk, clunk, clunk.  Some of them are half full.  Some of them are empty.  It's nice to know that we can finally afford nice cars and stuff, but we still treat them  like the old crappy car.  Oh, yeah.  But at least it's not like beer cans and beer bottles like it used to be. 
[00:09:30]  Yeah.  And the fast food wrappers and the passenger seat.  Oh, let me clear an area so you can sit.  That's because it's too early in the morning to drink beer or anything, because it used to  be.  So with afternoon, it was just like.  You just throw them in the back?  Yeah.  I just heave them in the back seat and it like fills up.  I mean, it fills up.  So when you turn turns, you're just hearing all this.  I hear this clanking and clunking.  All these bottles just clunking about.  And then the other day, I ran out of windshield washer fluid.  So I'm on the expressway doing about 60, 65. 
[00:10:00]  And I decide my windshield's very dirty.  So I open the sunroof.  And just throwing any bit of physics out the window or any bit of common sense out the window,  I decide I'm going to take one of these full bottles in the back, stick it out the sunroof,  give it a good squeeze, and it'll splash on my windshield at 65 and turn on the wipers.  They think the windshield got about a droplet or two as every bit of the bottle came back  through the sunroof right into my face on the expressway. 
[00:10:30]  It turned you into a prom day.  Exactly.  Yeah.  That guy was so annoyed when he was filling up your windshield.  It took two buckets to fill it up.  Yes.  It's very big.  Everything's big on that car.  It was bone dry, that thing.  All right.  How much did it cost to fill up the tank?  Well, you had a half tank, so it was 50 bucks.  Oh, okay.  It was only 50 because I had a half tank.  Usually like $100.  You've got to love the gas guzzlers.  All right, Kenny, what else is going on?  We've got Sonny Ferrelli here. 
[00:11:00]  Yes, Sonny Ferrelli is here.  Yeah.  There's a big setup in the parking lot for our walkover.  Okay.  A lot of activities for the walk.  Well, I created a bit of a controversy because at the last minute, Anthony and I were talking.  And for the new listeners, we do two radio shows a day.  We're on the commercial radio stations, and it's also heard on XM.  And then at 9 o'clock New York time, we just do an XM show for a couple hours.  Exclusively.  So at 9 o'clock, we want to leave WBCN, and we want to take whoever's in the parking lot to IHOP and just give them free breakfast. 
[00:11:30]  And do the show from IHOP, kind of.  Well, I want to tell Eric Logan right now, sort of do the show.  Like from cell phones or whatever BCN could set up, and we just hang out at the IHOP with our listeners.  Get around the table and just BS and pizza and pancakes.  Yeah, that's what we want to do.  Pizza and pancakes.  So now the staff here at BCN, they're just...  Flapjacks.  They're scrambling.  They're trying to figure out if we can do this or not.  Flapjacks. 
[00:12:00]  And we wanted to walk to IHOP, and they're like, ah, we got to call the cops and stuff.  Really?  Because they'll shut us down.  Why?  I don't know.  Can't you do anything like spontaneous anymore?  It was like a little prank I guess you played last time you were here.  Oh, no.  We did that prank eight years ago.  He's invited.  They're still holding a grudge.  Yeah, we're going to get into that today.  The mayor of Boston's still holding a grudge, and he's got to just relax.  Can he lighten up?  Can we get him on the phone? 
[00:12:30]  Maybe we could give him a list of...  There are certain people that all we have to do is sit and talk with them and we're pals again.  I don't know how that works.  Well, wait till we tell you about Whoopi and the update there.  Yeah.  We're going to get into that.  All right, so we're just warming up.  We're going to try to do the IHOP thing.  We'll see if they can pull it off.  Because at 9 o'clock, we don't really feel like continuing.  Is that it?  We just don't feel like it today?  We have a real busy weekend.  We've got the ONA traveling virus at the DCU Center tomorrow.  Tickets still available.  We're giving out tickets to the show to anyone who shows up pretty much, I think, right? 
[00:13:00]  Yes.  All right, so we've got to prepare for that.  And I think it would be nice of us to take the Boston listeners to breakfast at IHOP.  And the XM listeners will be able to listen in somehow.  Yeah.  We're trying to figure that out.  We'll still do radio, but it's going to be...  Yeah, don't worry about it.  It's going to be like crappy radio.  Keith, the cop is here.  Keith, how is the pal talk situation gearing up? 
[00:13:30]  Wait, what happened?  Well, I'm an idiot.  Blame it on me.  I'll take full blame.  I was supposed to bring my laptop here, and I forgot.  And it is in my hotel room.  Do you leave it at Gary Glitter's house?  I know.  Kenny's like, I'll go back to the hotel and get it.  No!  No!  No, no, no, no.  Don't even touch it.  Yeah, I have to delete history and do a lot of stuff.  God forbid on your way here there's an accident and someone takes it and looks at it. 
[00:14:00]  The disc falls out.  Kenny walks into Anthony's room.  He sees nothing but Girl Scout uniforms.  But they're all in Anthony's size.  Cotton candy.  Cotton candy machine.  What the hell?  We're only here for a couple days.  It's like bubble gum and homework.  A patent leather shoe with cranberry sauce on it.  Yeah, because we're all like, Kenny can just go get your laptop.  No, no, no, no, no.  You don't want to go in there. 
[00:14:30]  Still cleaning up from last night, huh?  I forgot it.  And, yeah, it's got all the software for PalTalk in it.  So Keith has been working diligently trying to get the software downloaded and get the camera  hooked up and everything and the drivers.  Poor Keith is still at that sign-on window.  He's at the password screen.  Here's how it works in radio.  Whenever you plug a computer in that is not one of the corporate computers, 18,000 protocols  have to be taken care of and gone through.  It's ridiculous.  He has not gotten past the password screen. 
[00:15:00]  Nobody has an administrative password.  Administrative password.  All right.  Put in C-sucker.  See how that works.  So hopefully we'll get the PalTalk cameras up for everybody today.  But we're live from WBCA.  We're just warming up.  I think we're going to take a quick break here so we can tweak a few things and make  this sound a little better.  The camera is Heather Mills' leg.  It's that useless right now.  Waffle.  Nothing.  So when we get back, we've got to talk about the Boston Herald.  We made it into the Boston Herald today. 
[00:15:30]  Yes, we did.  We made it into the Boston Globe today.  We made it into New York Daily News today.  Daily News.  The whole whoopee thing blew up yesterday after we left you guys and continued on XM.  We'll get into that.  We've got some clips from our XM show.  You've got to hear.  Yeah.  That's the big tease.  Trust me.  Don't go anywhere today.  And the New York Post, once again, just ignored us.  Ignored that we're actually doing a radio show.  Another big radio story.  And the New York Post decided that we're just not worthy for their stupid paper.  All right. 
[00:16:00]  We'll continue.  It's the O&A virus live from Boston.  Boston.  Yes.  As we spread across America.  Hey, the energy.  Whoa.  Whoa.  That was Steve and Nathaniel.  All right.  We'll be back.  You're too close to me.  You've got a war face.  What the F?  Ah.  That's a war face.  Now let me see your war face.  No.  You didn't convince me.  Let me see your real war face.  No.  No. 
[00:16:30]  You don't scare me.  Work on it.  Jackass.  You're very unscared.  Hear what everyone else is talking about.  O&A Uncut and live.  Continuing the show on XM Satellite Radio starting at 9 a.m. Eastern.  Visit XMRadio.com to subscribe.  Opie and Anthony.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony.  Live from WBCN in Boston.  Quick and retarded. 
[00:17:00]  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony Show.  The O&A virus spreading across America.  We're in Boston this morning.  Everyone's eating.  Bunch of slobs.  Steak and egg whites.  My favorite.  Ooh.  Jimmy's having a little fruit.  Yummy.  And Anthony's having a bagel. 
[00:17:30]  Of course.  Why would anything change?  Man, we got a lot of press today.  A lot.  We're in both Boston papers.  And it's good because we've gotten a lot of press before.  But that's usually been bad.  Yeah, yeah.  Usually been, you know, we're out of work.  This virus you'll want to catch from the Boston Herald.  It's a homecoming for Opie and Anthony.  Back on the radio.  Now back in Boston and Worcester.  They're broadcasting live this morning from WBCN. 
[00:18:00]  Meeting with fans.  Then taking their traveling virus comedy show to Worcester's DCU Center tomorrow, Saturday.  With tickets still available.  And if you show up here at BCN, we're going to just hand you a pair of tickets, by the way.  Anthony said, we hold a fond place in our hearts for Worcester.  I said that?  No, you didn't.  I didn't say that.  How many times did you actually go to Worcester when we were broadcasting up here?  How many times did we have to?  Because that's the number of times. 
[00:18:30]  We broadcast from a show at the Centrum every once in a while.  We did that.  We saw Van Halen, Bush, Van Halen, and that band AC.  Right.  The band's back in the late 90s.  You were never able to say their name on the radio.  Yeah, that's great marketing.  Way to go.  It was AC.  Way to go, guys.  You can't say either word on the radio.  No, A is yes, and C is yes. 
[00:19:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, you can figure it out.  They could have called it front and back.  That's right.  If they wanted to.  At least you could throw that on a poster and maybe get some advertising on the radio.  Yeah, that wasn't really thinking when you're sitting in a room to come up with a band name,  to come up with something that no one could even say on the radio.  That was a bunch of dudes that were just really, really high and wasted all the time thinking  it was a great idea to come up with the most obnoxious, offensive band name ever.  I think they warmed up for Pantera back in the day.  Yeah.  So that's when we went to Worcester for the shows at the Centrum. 
[00:19:30]  The Boston Herald continues.  That's where the radio duo first shocked Massachusetts listeners almost a decade ago on WAF.  They are now based in New York.  The tour features performances by Bob Saget, Robert Kelly, Bill Burr, Patrice O'Neill, Rich Voss, Tracy Morgan, Ralphie May, and ONA Sidekick.  Yeah.  Sidekick.  Go ahead.  You don't want to be called a sidekick, though. 
[00:20:00]  Better than being called a staffer.  Staffer.  Staffer.  That is horrible.  Yeah, it certainly is.  We'll get to it.  And ONA sidekick, Jim Norton.  We'll get to it.  What's the matter?  Wasn't driver available?  Chauffeur.  Wow.  Staffer.  Street team member.  Being on BCN now, the logical place would have been Boston.  We're talking about where we should have done the ONA traveling virus. 
[00:20:30]  Being on BCN now, the logical place would have been Boston.  We're closer to Boston, Anthony said.  But we're hearing things.  We're hearing things.  Yeah.  That Mayor Menino might still be holding a bit of a grudge.  That's what was told to us.  That's what I heard.  We were told that we couldn't play Boston, the Tweeter Center, because the mayor was still  holding a grudge and he was making it very, very difficult for us to get the permits and  such.  I hear he's going to try to keep us off a letterman.  Menino.  He'd probably have a better shot at it than Howie. 
[00:21:00]  Yeah.  You notice how Howie shut his trap yesterday?  Smart move.  Ah, yes.  The obligatory reference to their 1998 April Fool's prank when they claimed Menino died.  That stunt got them fired.  And this is where it gets interesting.  And it'll segue into the next thing we want to talk about today.  Anyway, this week they're pranking Whoopi Goldberg, who debuted Monday on a different New York  City radio station.  The guy said, and it wasn't really pranking.  Was it pranking?  We just acknowledged she was on the air and just kind of laid into her. 
[00:21:30]  Yeah.  You know, she's doing a show that's pretty much aimed at women.  And some of the stuff she was talking about was we were goofing on it.  We played it on our show and goofed on it.  It was very easy to goof on it.  Opie predicted it's going to be a complete disaster.  She doesn't have the work ethic to put on a good radio show.  This is hard work.  People don't realize that.  This is what sucks about doing these articles like the days in advance.  Yeah. 
[00:22:00]  You would think if you pick up the Boston Herald today that we did the interview yesterday.  No, I think we did it like Monday or last week or something.  Things happen.  Because, boy, have things changed as far as Whoopi goes.  The comedy tour includes many of ONA's favorite stand-up comedians who often call in or visit the studio.  The show also includes a village where there's some fun things to occupy the fans, Anthony added.  Little freak shows, entertainment on the side.  Accused them of being sophomoric or childish?  Oh.  They won't deny it.  No?  I don't think I ever left my 20s, Opie said. 
[00:22:30]  According to the newspapers.  This could be my worst quote ever.  I don't think I ever left my 20s.  I don't think I ever left the 20s.  The roaring 20s.  I'm just a big kid.  Jimmy gave me a great smashing yesterday at dinner.  Did he?  We ate at Legal Seafood in one of the malls in the area.  And we were talking about the time that I was trying to, like, say that I still get recognized as a college kid. 
[00:23:00]  Oh, right.  And they're looking at me like, who is this college kid?  I'm like, is that what they think?  College kid.  Rodney Dangerfield in Back to School.  Why did you say that as I was thinking?  He reminded me how stupid that was to say.  Thanks, Jimmy.  I did the triple Lindy, huh?  Did you, Opie?  Did you?  I don't think I ever left my 20s, Opie said.  I'm actually looking at buying a house for the first time.  Oh. 
[00:23:30]  Yeah, someone's going to make a connection very soon, by the way.  Right.  It's strange to me.  I'm not a big fan of adult responsibilities.  Anthony said he enjoys goofing on my friends and being stupid.  That's my job description.  We just got lucky that the job we had affords us the ability to do that, he said.  And that's the Boston Herald article.  The Globe article is pretty similar, talking about the ONA traveling virus and how we're  going to have the petting zoo.  Do you want to explain the petting zoo, Anthony?  I don't even think I can.  I'm not sure exactly what it is myself.  We have our freak show people that are tied in peripherally with this show. 
[00:24:00]  The likes of a stalker, Paddy, Big A.  Pat from Menaki.  Pat from Menaki.  Big A yesterday, a huge hit on the show.  I was listening to the replay.  And just everyone goofing on his big, stupid shoes had me roaring.  And a little update, by the way, on Big A.  When we walked out of the studios at XM onto the sidewalks of Manhattan, Big A was walking 
[00:24:30]  up with his brand new shoes from Nike Town.  Christmas shoes, Ro!  Ro, it had me in tears.  They bought him his shoes!  I don't know.  They are.  Wait, I was going to say, it's Nike Town.  Yeah, they went to Nike Town.  I don't know how you do it, but he picked out the worst pair of sneakers that Nike Town  sells.  The brothers won't wear these shoes.  They are so bad. 
[00:25:00]  It looks like sneakers that an old lady would wear.  They were snake skin.  They were snake skin sneakers.  White snake skin.  It looked like his feet were pythons that just swallowed a pig.  Big, fat, disgusting feet squeezed into snake skin sneakers.  Oh, what an ass.  Oh, what a boob.  Oh, yeah.  And he was all happy with them because he said, I'm happy with these. 
[00:25:30]  Like my new kicks.  Shut up.  So, there you have it.  That's the update.  And the pictures were up on opianthony.com.  When he puts them on, the tongue of the shoe and the heel actually has to dislodge its jaw  to swallow his big foot.  Snake skin.  Jackass.  It's really hip in like 1984.  No one's wearing snake skin.  So is he, Sinatra?  Big, fat boob.  I have a big white belt in 1971. 
[00:26:00]  Fat idiot.  Should have gotten platform shoes.  I'm walking away crying like that poor kid in Saturday Night Fever.  You don't call me to Tony.  A one-piece outfit like Elvis, like the white body covering.  They can wear that in a cape and then kick him into traffic and watch him get paralyzed.  Stupid snake skin.  Sneakers.  Snake skin.  He's not going to make the ONA Traveling Virus?  Is Big A going to make it?  Oh, here's Clywood Kenny with all the headings, though.  Why won't Big A come? 
[00:26:30]  Big A, ugh.  You're talking into the wrong part of the mic.  They're probably not even sneakers, by the way.  They're probably two pocketbooks he has his feet in.  Big A has his cousin's wedding tomorrow.  His family?  So that's his excuse for tomorrow.  Well, first of all, let me just say, your cousin does not need you at the wedding.  Do you think they want you spoiling the photos?  Oh, those photos.  Yeah, hey, who's the big fat pedophile with the white shoes on?  It's just a guy who shows up.  You know he's going to wear those stupid snakeskin sneakers to a wedding. 
[00:27:00]  Yeah, and he'll probably cross and cross his legs a lot so your eyes are drawn to him.  Yeah.  Kenny, by the way, we're getting reports that people are already outside for the walkover that we're going to do at 9 o'clock.  Kenny, talk into this.  Yeah, right into the front.  There you go.  We really want to try to buy everyone that shows up breakfast at IHOP.  All right.  Oh, boy, he's thrilled with the prospect of that.  No, I'm pulling out my credit card.  I want this to work.  Wow.  Somebody call the Herald. 
[00:27:30]  Let it be known.  I picked up dinner last night.  You certainly did.  I tried very hard to throw it, perhaps, and he wouldn't have it.  Knowing that XM would reimburse me.  Yeah.  He's finally figured out how to hand in expense reports, I see.  No, it's a great way to make yourself look like a big shot.  Yeah.  Knowing you're getting the money back.  You got the money back.  But he's too OCD to not say it.  Like, you couldn't just, you had to say that because it was the honest thing to say.  So you're like, well, you know, XM will, you know. 
[00:28:00]  XM paid for it.  Yeah.  This wasn't fine.  But find out what's going on.  We want to broadcast live from IHOP or outside IHOP.  We'll buy breakfast for the first, I don't know, 10 people.  10 people.  It's a long walk, you know, down the highway.  They could walk.  We'll take a cab or something.  We'll drop.  Oh, great, because they're so available.  Yeah.  Could you go outside and see what's going on out there?  Yeah.  We'll get an update from Club Soda Kenny from the parking lot of WBCN.  We're in the middle of nowhere, so I can't even give you directions. 
[00:28:30]  We didn't even know how to get here.  The cabbies didn't know how to get here.  The staff that we called really didn't know how to get here.  You want the address?  Yeah, go ahead.  83 Leo Birmingham Parkway.  Okay.  Thanks, Kenny.  Leo Birmingham.  Kenny, go outside now and get on the cell phone and we'll get an update.  I hear you.  Because I think it'll be fun that you're...  Busty Leo Birmingham.  That Mondo Topless?  Mondo Topless.  Okay.  I loved that. 
[00:29:00]  The Boston Globe also wrote about us today.  Don't worry.  We're not going to just read these articles word for word, but some of the interesting  stuff from the Boston Globe article about the ONA traveling virus.  In addition to the main comedy event, there will be something called The Village, which  features exhibits and attractions like a clinic where women in nurses' uniforms dole out  back rubs and booths designed by diehard ONA fans known as pests.  The pests are getting way too much attention.  Yeah.  Every news story we're in, they are now in. 
[00:29:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  They're like a publicist.  Yeah.  The pests are not speaking today to the press.  Yeah.  They're going to be coming on the show, but they're a little concerned about the contest  you have going on.  It's going to be bad for their image.  We have to pre-interview them before they come in.  The pests have their own MySpace account.  What is it?  Opie and Anthony Pests?  Yeah.  On MySpace?  Opie and Anthony Pests.  Yeah.  I think so.  And then they have a website.  I don't think we're allowed to say the address to. 
[00:30:00]  I have no idea.  FBA?  It's FBA.com, but if you know what FBA stands for, type that in.  Just think Robert Reed, Rock Hudson.  Just think those things when you're doing FBA.com.  Right.  Of course, FBA is a great site.  It really is a great site, and that's where most of the pests hang out.  And we've got a lot of great fan sites, so now the other fan sites are going to get pissed  at us, but we're just promoting them right at this second.  Calm down.  There will also be a petting zoo for the show's regular sidekicks like Twitchell's and Stalker 
[00:30:30]  Patty.  Oh, Jesus.  You can actually feed them candy corn and take your pictures with them, P. Popolardo says.  I would just get a handful of candy corn and throw it at Twitchell's face.  Could you do that for me?  Louis Twitchell Santan?  Of course.  Louis Twitchell Santani.  His old website was Laughter by Lou.  Oh, that was his, it's not a site anymore, but that was his old site, Laughter by Lou.  It sounds like a plumber's site.  Like, it should just be Plumbing by Lou. 
[00:31:00]  Laughter by Lou is not funny.  Or the title of, it's like a bad Lifetime movie about a comedian who brings, like, laughs  to, like, the terminally ill with cancer.  Yeah.  And then he dies.  Hopefully, yeah.  And everyone laughs.  It's on the comedy channel.  One of the cancer patients just chokes him with a catheter.  I'm stupid.  Boy, this is a terrific article, by the way.  We just hate everybody.  I know.  They're all friends of the show.  They come in for free.  They're all nice.  They don't get paid a dime.  A lot of time.  And we just bash them. 
[00:31:30]  They just want to be treated nice.  Make us feel better about ourselves.  A little observation, by the way.  The Boston Globe talking about the O&A traveling virus.  And did they talk to Ant and I?  Did they talk to Jim Norton?  Oh, no.  No.  This article, they decided to talk to Pete Pappalardo.  He is Mr. Excitement.  He knows the concert business, but he's just a bore.  He's the behind-the-scenes guy.  Right.  And there's a reason for it.  Yeah.  But he's all over this article, as well as Rich Voss. 
[00:32:00]  Oh, great.  What did Rich have to say?  Well, it's a good day out for people that don't have jobs.  It's a good day for people out.  Does it say it's a good day for people out?  It's a good day out for people that don't have jobs.  Good day out for people.  Okay.  Says Voss, a regular on the radio show, as he busts on the show's fan base by saying,  You can always tell an O&A fan because they have no muscle tone. 
[00:32:30]  No muscle tone.  It's not that bad, actually.  The stage where the comics perform will be a go-go bar, complete with poles for dancers.  I don't think we're trying to be in-your-face offensive.  I think we're trying to mimic the radio show and bring what people get to listen to on a daily basis,  including the comics, says P. Popalardo.  What a great quote.  Some of the exhibitions were news to Voss.  When told Opie and Anthony are planning a petting zoo, he asks, 
[00:33:00]  Are they really?  I hope I don't get a letter.  Hey, you're in the petting zoo.  Voss counts Norton O'Neill and some of the other O&A regulars among his best friends,  but it's the comic firepower of the whole lineup that impresses him the most.  I feel sorry for the guy who's got to go last, he says, but it will be a lot of fun.  I had a couple of Rich Voss clips, but apparently this isn't on.  What happened? Why isn't it on?  I don't know. 
[00:33:30]  I don't think the sound is up on it.  Well, we can figure it out.  Is it this thing?  Is that it? Let me check, because I'll throw this clip on.  Hit it.  I'm not afraid to.  Goddamn Rich Voss.  Whoa.  Ah, scared you. I got you.  You got me.  You got me.  Oh, that's this one.  Goddamn Rich Voss.  We all know what the real one is.  Yeah, that we play over at XM.  Oh my God, my heart is...  I know, you like pull the fader down.  We're not in our home studio where we're all comfortable. 
[00:34:00]  I really thought you lost your mind.  I thought you lost your mind.  Did Stan find that button?  Yes.  Good boy.  Ooh.  All right.  Getting back to the Whoopi thing.  So, just got to get everyone back on the same page.  Where's the Boston Herald article again?  I just want to read that one thing.  The Herald.  All right.  Opie predicted it's going to be a complete disaster.  Talking about Whoopi's show, right?  Yeah.  She doesn't have the work ethic to put on a good radio show.  This is hard work.  People don't realize that.  So, we trashed her in the Boston Herald today because we did this interview about four or 
[00:34:30]  five days ago.  Yeah.  When we get back, we will give you the Whoopi Goldberg update.  Complete with audio?  Complete with audio from our XM show.  Mm-hmm.  You're not going to believe what happened.  I'm not?  Well, the faithful listeners already know.  I believe it.  And the people that pick up the New York papers already know.  I believe it.  All you have to do is go on the internet and you know.  So, this is a stupid radio tease, but we'll get into the audio next.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America. 
[00:35:00]  We're in Boston this morning.  Is Kenny ready for his update?  Yeah, you want to do it?  Yeah.  How do we do that before we take a break?  Another Mr. Excitement.  Clips out of Kenny.  I'm in the parking lot.  Hit it.  Hold on.  Kenny?  Hold on.  Hold on.  Kenny?  Kenny?  Kenny?  I almost hear something.  Kenny?  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  Really, Steve?  Club soda Kenny? 
[00:35:30]  Yeah.  All right.  We still got to figure out the phones.  Kenny?  Uh-oh.  Look at him.  There's a problem.  Can we get Kenny on the line real fast?  Why'd you turn this off?  Oh, turn that on?  Yeah.  I told him that.  Club soda Kenny.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm in the parking lot.  All right.  What's going on in the parking lot of WBCN?  Yeah.  Let me tell you something.  Nice echo. 
[00:36:00]  You guys have the most faithful, dedicated fans.  Yeah.  Why?  Because the loser showed up so far.  How many?  How many?  What is your Jimmy, the psycho guy?  There's one guy up there.  Jimmy, the psycho guy is here.  We have one fan?  One fan showed up for us.  No, there's five.  Oh, there's five.  All right.  Well, hey.  Hey, okay.  Here comes the number one, six.  Six. 
[00:36:30]  All right.  That's good.  Yeah, that Jimmy, the psycho fan is here.  They must have got lost on the way.  Of course.  I think they're just lost.  Yes.  They're probably, I bet you there's hundreds at the old studio.  I got confused and went to the old WBCN studio.  I'm sure that's what it is.  I think we're still in New York.  They're waiting outside of our Manhattan studios.  All right, Kenny, we got six people.  Yeah, yeah.  They all get a pair of tickets to the ONA traveling virus tomorrow at the DCU. 
[00:37:00]  And they can all bring 20 friends.  All right, Kenny, we'll check in with you in a little bit.  All right, I'll be back in March.  All right.  Are other people hearing that echo?  Yes.  Yeah.  On the radio or just us?  I don't know.  I heard it in my headphones.  It's how he got sucked through a television set.  Mommy.  Right.  Look into the light.  Forget it.  Stay.  Walk.  Walk away from the light, stupid.  Walk right into it.  Walk to the light.  Okay.  Walk to the light.  There's people here telling me to come with them. 
[00:37:30]  Good.  Go.  Go.  We don't need you.  All right.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  We're live from Boston.  We'll continue in just a bit.  Robe.  Soup.  Tears.  Poodle.  Robert Reed.  And repeat.  And repeat.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The ONA virus spreading across America. 
[00:38:00]  We're live from WBCN in Boston.  And we couldn't be happier.  Enjoy all the screw-ups. 
[00:38:30]  It's so weird to be in another radio station.  Yeah.  Different boards.  That's a futuristic-looking board you're working there.  It's very strange.  Steve, what kind of job is Opie doing on the board?  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  Oh, wait.  Thanks.  Wait, wait.  Because it's not turned up.  Wow.  How ironic.  Well, what did Steve say?  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  All right.  You know what the problem is?  Things have to be turned on and off?  No, no, no.  As the show goes along?  No, I'm just turning things off. 
[00:39:00]  Oh, is that it?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I've been doing this radio thing since I was 18.  So more than half my life.  And I don't know.  To me, it seems like there's too many things on.  You don't like a lot of things on.  So I'm just turning things off.  And there are things that we use during the show.  That's why the phone was echoing.  I'm just turning things off.  I think it has something to do with OCD or something.  I don't know.  Leave them on.  I'm trying.  But there's too many lights on.  To me, that doesn't make sense.  That is what happens when you're raised with a lot of brothers and sisters. 
[00:39:30]  Because you're so used to turning things off when you yell that because everybody wastes electricity.  You got nothing.  Off, off, off.  Off, off, off.  Yeah.  That's right.  All right.  Figure that out.  Hey, let's get right into the Whoopi thing.  You want to set up the Whoopi thing for people?  Oh, my goodness gracious.  I mean, we do have a lot of new listeners in Chicago and San Francisco.  They're just getting into the program.  Let's see.  The beginning of the week, Whoopi Goldberg started her new program.  She's starting in the radio biz.  And she had her show. 
[00:40:00]  And we had listened to a little bit of it and decided that it stunk.  That's what we said.  We go, this show stinks.  So we brought some of the audio onto our show, played it, and ragged it mercilessly.  I mean, really, really ragged it.  And we were having fun with it for a couple of days.  Right.  And, well, I don't want to give away the whole big surprise.  We didn't have anything personally against Whoopi Goldberg. 
[00:40:30]  We just, and we still think that her radio show is lame.  We really do.  It certainly isn't going after the same listeners as we are.  Right.  That's for sure.  Going after women, you know, totally different than what we're looking for.  We're looking for men who attack them.  Wake up with Whoopi.  Wake up with Whoopi.  Right.  So then the press got a hold of it and had all the quotes.  I was quoted as saying that she should go back to Hollywood. 
[00:41:00]  Yeah, that was one of them.  But I said it a little differently.  Uh-huh.  I said, go back to Hollywood, you bitch.  You did say that.  Yes, sir.  Yes, sir.  Then she had to mention Howard Stern because I guess people think that's the way to get to us.  Yeah.  Just mention any type of Howard Stern thing and these guys will go nuts.  Oh.  So something about we're not worthy to walk in Howard's dust or something like that?  Or the dust he walks in.  I don't know.  Whatever.  Something.  And that made the paper. 
[00:41:30]  So it was getting ugly.  The pests were attacking her radio show.  Well, that was a big part of it.  Our pests were tying up her phone lines and getting through and making ridiculous, retarded references to this very program on her airwaves.  And, yeah, upsetting her show.  And yesterday, for this side of the Opie and Anthony show, we left you after just beating her up again.  Yeah.  Playing her demo tape.  Pointing out how awful this is.  Yeah, we did that. 
[00:42:00]  And we went over to XM and we continued our broadcast.  Our potty mouth broadcast.  And we were in the middle of something when this happened.  Jimmy, turn around.  Oh, wow.  Holy Jesus.  Mother of God.  Wow.  In trouble.  You know something.  You got balls.  You got balls.  Bravo, Whoopi.  Whoopi Goldberg in the studio.  Wow.  Good morning. 
[00:42:30]  Good to see y'all.  I understand you've been sending messages for me to come and visit.  So I decided I'd come up and see y'all.  Because I know you were concerned about a couple of things.  And I really wanted to clear it up.  You know, because especially the whole thing about the, you know, the, what do you call it?  The what?  The stuff that you put on your sunscreen.  Yeah, the sunscreen.  Because I know you were concerned that black people didn't know anything about sunscreen.  So I thought I'd come up and tell you your mamas were wrong.  They put the wrong s*** on you.  Wow.  She had all the info. 
[00:43:00]  Yeah, we spent about, I don't know, a half hour on our show talking about how she was reading the ingredients on a suntan bottle or something.  Yeah.  And we couldn't believe that someone would actually do this on the radio.  About how to apply it, the sunscreen, what is in it that keeps the sun's harmful rays off of you and what you should look for on the back of it.  And we were like, no one's doing this type of radio.  So we ripped it apart.  And she came in.  And as you can see, we just reacted like three just collapsible camera stands just folded like tense, fawning little bitches. 
[00:43:30]  Yeah, well, oh, hi, ma'am.  Hi.  Feel free.  Get her a Coke.  Whoopi.  We were in the middle of making fun of somebody.  And next thing you know, she's in our studio.  Eric Logan from XM set the whole thing up.  She walks right in, sits down.  Jimmy's like looking at Anthony laughing his s*** off.  And, well, you heard the clip. 
[00:44:00]  I said, Jimmy, turn around.  And there's Whoopi like three feet away from Jimmy.  And I had looked to my right and I saw Elo walk by on the outside with that abominable shirt he had on.  And I just turned around like Elo's here.  I was just like, all right, whatever.  And then I just turned around before she came in to I lied.  And it was kind of weird.  Yeah, that was a shock.  It was great.  Yeah, she was very cold.  You've got to admit, she has balls.  She walked right in.  She got to respect her for coming in like that.  She didn't come in with people or anything, like one guy.  Just her business partner.  Business partner looked like he really thought it was a bad idea. 
[00:44:30]  And he looked like he wanted to kill us.  But it went very well.  The pictures are up on opianthony.com, by the way.  She completely diffused the situation.  Yeah.  Which, you know, ruins it for us because we like when there's somebody to beat up on.  We like when there's a new show in town because we can pick it apart and, you know, make it look silly.  And she was really nice and came in and diffused the whole thing.  This is making headlines all over the place today.  All over the place, except for the New York Post, because to them this isn't a very important radio story. 
[00:45:00]  Everyone else in radio thought it was a very important story.  And we're getting killed.  Are they talking about if standards are coming back, the standard format?  Right.  If a show tune station can be starting up somewhere?  We're getting killed today by the press, and I say that's okay.  Why?  Yeah.  This shows another side of us.  A lot of people expected us to jump out of our chairs and start strangling her or something.  It's inconsistent.  This is completely consistent with what we've done in the past any time we've been confronted with anybody. 
[00:45:30]  We're mouthy jerk-offs when you're not around.  Get used to that.  We're the 12-year-old idiot on the Internet without a, you know, behind a keyboard, but then, you know, you knock on the door, go to punch him in the face.  It's a kid.  There's a difference.  When it's something personal, we continue, and we will go right at you.  And we have.  But we didn't have anything personal against Whoopi Goldberg.  We just heard her show.  We had her pest call, and we thought it was awful radio. 
[00:46:00]  Yeah.  And the type of radio that our listeners would not get into whatsoever.  So we had fun goofing on, and we do it all the time.  Like, we talk about that stupid man-town show out there in Worcester.  Yeah.  You know?  It's the same crap.  Well, here we go.  There's more audio from yesterday's XM show.  So now she talks about the pests.  It's amazing.  They just, nobody cares what we say, but the listeners affect everybody.  By the way, who went through these clips?  Why? 
[00:46:30]  All right, Than.  I just want to make sure, because they should be curse-free, right?  You listen to them so many times that even in the background, you won't hear any kind of bad word or anything.  Thumbs up by Than.  All right.  Hey, good move, wearing the Yankees cap here in Boston.  I like that.  This boy's got gumption.  Yes.  You'll be beat up by noon.  I'm wearing a Celtics jersey.  I'm not stupid.  Celtics sundress.  That's the longest shirt I've ever seen.  With knees.  Look at a little kid who wears, like, an adult sundress. 
[00:47:00]  Like a 1920s bathing suit.  They gave us gifts.  I'm wearing my gift.  And I'm not wearing it to look good.  I know it looks like a dress.  I want to see it.  I don't like the pants under it, though.  I just want to see it, like, as it is.  I bet you would.  I just came with no pants.  I'm wearing that, like a dress.  You know, I'll take that picture for you.  I don't care.  I haven't been shy lately, so.  It would be very funny.  And I'm sure E-Rock would enjoy taking that picture.  Oh, please.  Why don't you lay on your back like you're a great and photograph it as he walks over,  like Monroe.  Not Marilyn, but the one from Too Close Coats. 
[00:47:30]  I'll do that during the break.  The pictures will be up on opiananthony.com from our visit here in Boston.  Monroe.  Jim J. Bullock.  Where's the eye, faggot?  Stop touching that, Monroe.  Here's more whoopee from our show yesterday on XM as she paid us a surprise visit.  Here's the deal.  Here's the deal.  You know, I knew that I was going to get something from somewhere.  And so I expected it, and it was cool.  It was cool.  So the fleas, what do you call them? 
[00:48:00]  The pests.  You know, that's funny.  Why aren't you doing this stuff on your show?  Because my show is geared to women in the morning, and that's what we're doing.  That's why it's a whole different group.  You couldn't jump on her, A, because she was right there and were creeps, and B, because she was being cool about it.  She didn't come in as confrontational.  She's like, yeah, I understand, but could you not do it? 
[00:48:30]  The biggest part of it is the fact that she's not a radio person who would never do anything like that.  Right.  She's a comic.  Stand-up comics.  Comics, no.  Yeah.  They're used to getting heckled on stage, so they know how to come back at it, and they know the best way to diffuse a problem.  Some club owners will tell you these dummies, like, if you get heckled, ah, just keep doing your act.  And it's like, that's what most radio guys do.  Ah, just pretend it's not happening.  But if there's something inside of her that was like, look, I don't care what these guys do. 
[00:49:00]  I want to look at them in their faces and tell them.  There was like a really, even if she didn't win the confrontation, she had to be in the room with us.  And look at everybody in the face and tell them what she wanted to say.  Yeah, whether her coming in bashing us or her coming in and being nice, she knows as a comic what the best way to diffuse the problem is.  When you're on stage and you get a heckler, you know the best way to handle them so you can continue with your act.  Dude, this heckle line I use, any comedian out there can use this.  If someone's heckling me, I'll go, sir, I'll go, sir, they didn't pay to hear you. 
[00:49:30]  That must just crack the place up.  Dude, the whole place goes nuts.  You'd be surprised.  And shuts him right down.  It's just terrific.  One time a guy was yelling in the back, and again, just be ready to dump out, Al.  I go, hey, could you keep it down to a dull roar?  Oof.  Come on now.  We're on broadcast radio here, Jeff.  All right, easy.  Come back, sir.  All right, so back to the whoopie.  So she, yeah, like we've been saying, she confronted us.  She came by herself except for some little dude that was not happy that she decided to do this. 
[00:50:00]  She got a lot of laughs on our show yesterday, which surprised us.  Not surprised us.  She seems like she's real confused about the radio world.  Well, she's never done it.  She's working for Clear Channel, and they want her to do a show for women.  And that's not her style, man.  Let her just let loose, you know?  All right, here's some more audio from yesterday's XM show.  Why do they have to show up?  You ruined everything.  You really did ruin everything. 
[00:50:30]  We had weeks in us.  I know you did.  I know you did.  September, ready to go.  You know, but you can always come back and do it.  But just let me establish the ladies first, please.  Because here's what happened.  Yeah.  Because they jammed the phones.  The phone lines?  You can't talk to anybody.  All these women got really pissed off and said, you know what?  If we can't talk to you, we're not going to listen.  And that kind of flipped everybody out.  She's asking for a truce.  No, no, I'm not.  I'm saying to you, you guys have been doing your show for years on both ends. 
[00:51:00]  I love you guys.  I know you're out to your silliest house.  But you always have been.  You always have been.  I hate this.  You're not.  Well, we have to make money with Whoopi.  Was that a curse at the end of that?  No?  Okay, good.  Look at that.  No, no.  It certainly wasn't.  She said, truck.  And she sneezed in front of her.  All right.  I'm waiting.  I'm hoping so much that there's a curse in one of these.  Just so we can mock Than.  We really do hate this, by the way, because we love having enemies. 
[00:51:30]  It just means we're going to have to find new enemies.  That's all.  She wasn't a personal enemy, though.  No.  Like, it was fun because her show content is so alien to us that it's just great fodder  to just play it and goof on it.  We're just dicks.  Yeah.  That's it.  That's all it is.  All right.  Well, it continues.  We're almost done here.  Now, the apologies.  Everyone starts apologizing.  Oh, boy.  What a doodle.  We should definitely be embarrassed today.  Yeah.  We should be embarrassed. 
[00:52:00]  Apologizing.  Oh, scary shock jocks.  Watch out.  Scary shock jocks broadcast.  You don't want to be on our bad side.  That's right.  Oh, hi.  How do you do?  Oh, sorry.  We didn't mean to say that.  Get home safe.  Godspeed.  Roveling girls we are.  I have to apologize.  Wearing dresses.  Oh.  Why did you say something?  Something's dirty.  Wait till I take my pants off.  Oh, I can't wait.  It's going to happen.  Isolate that.  Just for me, I mean. 
[00:52:30]  What did I do?  All right.  Here we go.  So, back to the tape from yesterday.  The apologies begin.  I have to apologize to Whoopi.  Why?  Why did you say something really bad?  You read it in the paper.  Oh.  You called me a bitch.  Yeah.  You know, here's the deal.  But you have to apologize to him.  It's true.  Why?  What the hell are you?  Because, because.  Why?  What?  The nerve of you to say that to him.  I know.  I didn't say that to her.  You really did kind of pull us out of it with that. 
[00:53:00]  Wait, what happened?  You have to apologize to?  Yeah.  For what?  She did nothing.  No.  She did everything right.  And then showed up, which I wouldn't have the balls to do.  And you have to apologize to?  Yeah.  For going on and doing her show?  Shit.  She just wanted.  What?  She just wanted to do her radio show, but.  I think she owed us an apology.  For what?  And I think we got one this morning, by the way.  We did, but why?  Huh?  There was no reason for her to apologize, so.  She hurt my feelings. 
[00:53:30]  You know, here's the deal.  But you have to apologize, too.  It's true.  Why?  Why?  Because, because I said you don't know when I'm, and here's what I'm talking about.  We can apologize first, because you have to apologize, too.  I apologize.  Because you got to us a little bit with the Howard Stern thing.  I'm sorry.  Did I really?  No, not real.  No, I didn't.  Full of bananas.  Full of bananas.  We just love seeing our name in the paper.  We're in the paper again today, matter of fact.  Yes, you are.  Yeah, we're publicity whores. 
[00:54:00]  We know it.  Whoopi, I apologize for calling you a bitch.  You know what?  It's okay, because it's true.  God, man, she's got a sense of humor, huh?  Yep.  All right.  Hate it.  Yeah, but I also like the fact, and I will say one thing in our defense, which basically  right now we're all bent over sinks defenseless, but I will say at least we admit what just  little groveling nothings we are in person.  Girls.  I have no problem showing this side.  Absolutely.  No problem.  Other radio hosts would have a real problem showing this side of their personality. 
[00:54:30]  I don't think they ever would have let her in the door, first of all.  There's a lot of, like, radio guys.  First of all, just corporate alone.  I don't know how they react to it, to all this.  This is a competing show on a competing company, so they're probably...  I wouldn't doubt that both sides caught a little crap.  Like, she probably caught a little something from Clear Channel, and I'm sure some of the  higher-ups over at CBS were none too happy.  It's good to see that there's someone else out there not listening to corporate. 
[00:55:00]  Yeah.  Just come on and do it.  Corporations stink.  There's a lot of radio shows that would be like, no, no, no.  I don't want her on.  Don't be asked.  She's not coming on here, or, you know, they're not coming on the show.  But for now on, we're locking the doors, because I know there's going to be a Congo line.  Opie and Anthony, I just want to come in and say hi.  Robin, come in and sit down there.  They're cordial.  No, we're locking the doors.  We don't want Dice showing up to apologize. 
[00:55:30]  We don't want Howard showing up to apologize.  We don't want the Mantown crew.  No more apologies.  That's it.  No more.  Shut the door.  That's right.  All right, getting back to the audio.  We're almost done here.  Whoopi from yesterday.  Do you have a problem with Oprah?  No.  I've never had an Oprah problem.  What did I read about Oprah not inviting you to something?  A big woman thing?  And you was upset, or somebody thought you was upset?  No, people keep asking me, how come you're not there?  I keep saying, because it's her thing, and she didn't invite me. 
[00:56:00]  That's okay.  You know, if it's your party, I can't be pissed off if she didn't invite me to your party.  But you know her for, I mean, going back to the color purple.  All black people don't know each other.  Yeah, but that was 21 years ago.  We don't hang up.  We don't hang out.  You know, it's just we're not, we're acquaintances.  Very, very mild acquaintances.  All right, there you go.  And all black people don't know each other.  They do.  They do? 
[00:56:30]  They do?  That wasn't even funny if I said it right.  Yeah.  It's less funny than a trip on it.  Eek.  All right, and finally, finally the last whoopie clip from yesterday.  Hey, whoopie, could you thank us tomorrow?  Yeah, because we, uh, we're back live.  You got the big brass ones.  Why are you guys uncomfortable?  Why would she have to thank us?  What?  Huh?  We didn't do anything to help her.  No.  You don't think we helped her? 
[00:57:00]  No, but I mean, to thank us, I want to thank those guys.  She got like three or four articles in the paper this week because of us.  Oh, okay.  She owes us a thank you, and I heard we got a thank you when we got the audio.  I want to hear that.  She thanked us on her show today.  Oh.  Hey, whoopie, could you, um, could you thank us tomorrow?  Yeah, because we, uh, for the last three days, we gave you a lot of attention on New  York radio, and I think a thank you is in order.  Didn't you hear me say good morning at all?  Because even negative publicity is good.  You know that.  No, it's not.  It sure does that. 
[00:57:30]  Bad publicity is good.  Oh, any publicity.  That's what they told me when I read ONA fired on the cover of the paper.  It's like, yeah, that's good.  Will you thank us tomorrow on your show?  I will.  I will.  I think you deserve it.  I think you deserve it.  Can I give you all my best and tell you thanks for making it at least fun?  Yeah, whoopie.  Thank you so much.  Absolutely.  And I'll see you.  Can I come back sometime?  Yeah.  Okay.  You can absolutely come back.  Do you mind, though, if a couple times if you hit on a subject, can we just kind of talk  about it a little bit?  Please do.  If we're nice.  Please do it.  No, and even if you're tearing it to shreds, it's cool. 
[00:58:00]  It's cool.  Thanks for showing the rest of the country that we're a bunch of pussies.  We really are.  We're talking anonymously.  We're just cowards.  We get behind the screen door with our mother and yell something and then hide.  I saw her coming toward the door and I just went.  And there you have it from yesterday.  A love fest, wasn't it?  Ah, it's disgusting.  Good work, Dan.  It's disgusting.  How do you not respect the fact, though?  Even most of the fans' feedback I got actually on MySpace and the emails, and they'll be 
[00:58:30]  brutal to you there, even more so than on the phone, was like, hey, that was great  of her to show up, man.  She had balls.  Most people wouldn't walk into the studio and it was good.  Yeah.  A few people were saying that we were pussies.  We were, but who care?  What are we going to do?  I know.  The whole thing is play it out in your head.  But what would you have had us do if you wanted us to be vicious?  Get up and punch her in the face?  She was nice.  Yeah.  She walked in.  She didn't come in.  Like, I would have been furious if I had to confront people.  I would have tried to put on my ballsy hat, you know, and really walk.  But she didn't.  She just sat down and started talking. 
[00:59:00]  Our reputation's on the line, though.  We need Chachi to get us a retard immediately.  We've got to knock him around a little bit.  We've got to show everyone we still have it in us.  Kick around to a retard.  I think we have our own staff.  Some of our listeners outside.  Hey, that was just the highlights from yesterday.  She did talk about the O&A pest, and they got a little too aggressive outside, I guess,  where she broadcasts.  Yeah.  They confronted her and stuff.  Mm-hmm. 
[00:59:30]  I had a discussion with my girlfriend on the drive up about that subject.  Yeah.  And we're thinking perhaps Whoopi's just a little paranoid.  Oh, okay.  Like, I wouldn't doubt that a pest would do that.  Yeah.  But I'm thinking she goes confronting outside the building and walking right up to her.  And then you think for two seconds and go, it's Whoopi Goldberg.  If she's walking down the street, people are going to walk up to her.  But I bet you that they – here's what happens.  Because one thing about the pest, they are an irritating group, horribly irritating. 
[01:00:00]  But they don't threaten you.  I mean, they're just kind of, like, obnoxious.  Yeah.  But they probably walked up to her and just said, like, oh, hey, party rock.  But then without menace.  But, you know, if you –  But just the way they look.  If your first couple days on radio, you're getting beat up, and you're getting trashed  on the air, and you can't get your calls through, and all of a sudden these guys  are approaching you, it probably freaks you out.  That's probably what it was.  Yeah.  People don't do that in the movies.  Yeah.  Nobody approached her about sister acting, you know, or ghost.  And you see old, ghost sucks.  So that's probably just freaked her out a little bit. 
[01:00:30]  The radio is stupid.  Before we put this to rest, we should send her flowers or something.  I think the pests should send her flowers.  The pests, yeah?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Do something nice for once.  She was nice about it.  That's like a diplomatic mission.  It's like sending the Green Berets on some kind of a faggy diplomatic mission to deliver,  like, aid.  But they do watch it a while.  They do once in a while.  They'll stand guard while aid is being delivered. 
[01:01:00]  The Green Berets do good things.  The pests are like Hezbollah.  They're just lobbing missiles in.  They know nothing about aid.  They don't care about whoever it's hitting.  They don't care.  How are they going to send flowers?  Check the flowers.  There might be a ticking rose in there.  All right.  We've got to take a break.  Awful pests.  When we get back, we've got to continue with the Whoopi thing for a few more minutes because  there's a great article on the whole Whoopi thing in the New York Daily News with our  picture, with an observation as far as the picture goes, by the way. 
[01:01:30]  And also, we have Whoopi's thank you and apology from her show this morning.  And a good picture in the Daily News.  It's terrific.  Opie, Anthony, and ONA Stafford Jim Dorn.  Those bastards, man.  And then Jimmy's going to go off because there's some Lucky Louie stuff in the New York Daily  News as well.  And what?  As we continue, also, don't forget, we've got John Valby coming in today.  I shouldn't say don't forget because I don't think anyone knows.  Our old friend John Valby's playing Boston tonight, so he's stopping by WBCN. 
[01:02:00]  We've got our listeners in the parking lot.  We're going to try to take a lot of people to breakfast this morning starting at 9 o'clock.  Hopefully, we'll work that out.  Also, Andrew Dice Gay might be making an appearance.  You never know.  And Frank the Frowner, hopefully, will be here soon as well.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  We're live in Boston today.  And we'll continue in just a bit.  Opie, Anthony, Dance Party Weekend.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Nah, nah, nah.  Nah, nah, nah. 
[01:02:30]  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Comedy gone too far.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Ah, yeah.  There it was.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  We're live from Boston this morning.  The ONA traveling virus tomorrow in Worcester to the DCU Center.  Tickets still available through Ticketmaster.com. 
[01:03:00]  And we're giving people tickets that show up at the station today.  And don't worry, we'll come to a city near you.  It's all about Boston today.  Bear with us.  Because I know we got our new listeners in Chicago and San Francisco listening.  Grand Rapids.  And they're going, hey, what about us?  We're over here and I don't hear nothing about us.  Why don't you talk about Chicago?  And it's about Boston today. 
[01:03:30]  But we'll be there.  Don't worry.  It's just the overwhelming response of people who showed up today.  We'd be lucky if we get out of here alive.  Jesus.  You took a peek too, huh?  Oh, it's losing.  Oh, God.  It's utter madness.  We all took a peek to feel good about ourselves.  It's depressing.  We went out the back door and was like, oh, oh, great.  This is great.  Ten people showed up.  But the good thing is plenty of room to park.  You've got to take lemons and make lemonade.  And then you would think there are enough listeners out there where maybe they could fill up one of those tables and maybe talk to each other. 
[01:04:00]  Did you see that?  There's like everybody has their own table.  There's one table with two people there.  And other people just kind of sitting alone at this huge table for ten.  There's like ten tables for ten out there.  And one guy's alone.  There's another guy two tables away by himself.  A little sociopath.  Did you know it takes more muscles to frown than there are people in the parking lot? 
[01:04:30]  Frank the frowner, everyone.  During the break, Anthony and I were talking about sleeping.  Because Anthony out of nowhere just goes, I really got to sleep at night.  I just got to, well, like last night in particular, you know, we drive in.  We have a little meeting in a hotel room.  It was like a drug deal out of Scarface.  Oh, we checked out the TV commercial last night.  Yeah, we checked out the commercial.  We went back to the room.  Well, it was the weirdest thing.  They're like, meet us in room 903. 
[01:05:00]  903.  We're going to be in 903.  I'm not supposed to.  And we were late.  So the people that met us in room 903.  So some hot girl come out of the tub.  I hugged her.  She turned into an old bag.  Ran out of there.  So we get up to room 903.  And there's guys in there just completely hammered waiting for us because we were late.  Yeah.  Like, excuse the empty minibar, but we've been working on it for a while. 
[01:05:30]  Clotted in hell in here.  The air conditioner don't work.  The door's open.  Anyway, here's your TV commercial.  Here it is.  And then there was drunk babble for an hour.  These guys are drunk babble.  Well, do I speak the truth?  I think they were explaining.  Do I speak the truth?  They could have been a little buzzed.  Sure.  It was drunk babble.  Drunk babble.  These guys are experts at making TV commercials.  And I'm like, oh boy, we're in their hands.  Great.  Here it is.  Great.  The TV commercial looks good. 
[01:06:00]  Yeah, it really does.  They've got to do the final mix, but we're very happy.  Looks like a movie.  We're very happy how it turned out.  And it's going to be on the websites in the very near future.  Yes.  Very near future.  And television.  Oh, anyway, yeah.  So, Anthony said, I just got to sleep at night.  And I said, I discovered the greatest thing in the world.  I put earplugs in now.  I have an alright time sleeping.  It was just last night with that.  And then we get back to the room and I hadn't eaten, so I had to get room service. 
[01:06:30]  Very fancy.  And then after they come and bring the food, by that time it's late.  So, I got to sleep late.  Wake up very early here.  And I'm tired.  Usually I could get to sleep.  So, I don't need the earplug thing, but I do need other things.  But you were saying you sleep with earplugs in.  You thought I was crazy.  Yeah.  And what did you say?  I said I could never sleep with earplugs in because I can't be alone with my own thoughts  when I'm trying to sleep.  It doesn't work.  My mind, it runs wild and I can't have that. 
[01:07:00]  I need a television on.  Jimmy, you figured it out, right?  I need television on with the volume turned up so I could hear it.  Anthony was touched as a kid.  No, no, no.  It's pretty obvious now.  That never happened.  From the time he was three until he was 26.  And at 26, he figured it was time to tell somebody.  Yes.  It really, unless I blocked anything out, I have no recollection of that.  But I really don't remember anything like that happening. 
[01:07:30]  And I have a very clear recollection of my childhood, so I really don't think anything like that happened.  All signs are pointing to something.  We just don't know what that something is yet.  My mind is constantly working.  Like, if I lay down and there's no TV, no radio, no sound, and nobody in the room to talk to or, you know, my girlfriend's asleep or something,  I will lay there and my mind will go through things where it's like if you get on the internet and you're searching for tires and you find a link and then before you know it, like five minutes later, you're either on a porno site or computer games and you're like, 
[01:08:00]  what was I searching, oh yeah, tires.  And somehow you just skip along.  That's what happens in my head.  And it's just constant.  Boom, boom, boom, boom.  Things.  Ideas.  Horrible thoughts.  Happy thoughts.  Places. 
[01:08:30]  History.  Places I've lived.  Things I want to do.  Like, and how the hell am I going to get to sleep with all this crap going on?  He just likes to leave A&E on in case the old boss comes on and decides to spit something out in German and he'll catch it in his sleep.  I do like watching the Hitler Channel.  Oh, that big H in the side.  You think it's for history.  It's the Hitler Channel.  We are so different.  I throw those earplugs in and all I think about is blueberries.  See?  I know.  My mind is constantly packed out at like eight grand, ready to blow. 
[01:09:00]  I just think about my next bowl of blueberries.  See?  That's the only thought I have.  God, it must be so blissful.  During the day.  Jesus Christ.  During the day, lots of thoughts.  But there comes a time, time to turn off all phones.  If a relative dies in the middle of the night, you ain't going to know about it.  They can wait until six, obviously.  See, you don't have a regular home phone.  No.  You're just cell phone guy.  Yeah.  Stupid people that leave their phones on all night long because something might happen. 
[01:09:30]  They can wait.  You're not saving anyone's life at four in the morning.  There's a problem only you can solve.  I don't know.  I can't do it.  And then there's, you know, I was in bands for many, many years.  So my right ear, I get a little bit of a...  So you need sound to...  So I need a little sound to deaden that down.  I got that too, but I just picture...  It's called tinnitus, yeah.  I just picture that I'm at a beach somewhere.  Oh, is that it?  You got a shell up to your ear? 
[01:10:00]  I just visualize.  And you're just...  Boy, you are just a happy guy at night.  I know.  I'm miserable during the day, but...  At night?  Yeah.  Just sleeping like a baby.  It's all happy thoughts.  Blueberries and the seashore.  Hey, backing up.  So we all checked into the hotel.  And where were we going?  Oh, we had to go to the mall to get, like, Starbucks or something.  And all of a sudden, as we're heading toward the elevator, there's this guy with room service. 
[01:10:30]  Did you get, like, a cheese platter and fruit and stuff, courtesy of BCN and Chachi and the gang?  I don't think I got that.  Did we get that?  You got it?  You got it?  You got it.  Baby?  Chocolate-covered strawberry.  Chocolate-covered...  Wait, wait, wait.  But that came with room service, right?  Yeah, but it was complimentary from...  Oh, it was complimentary.  Okay, so we got three chocolate-covered strawberries, not a basket.  A guy comes out of the elevator.  He has a cheese plate, fruit, some kind of, like, chocolate thing, and some water, right? 
[01:11:00]  And he's heading toward, we think, and we're not sure to this point, by the way, we think  to Jim Norton's room.  Did you spit on it?  We stopped the guy, and we said, oh, that's for us?  And then we dug in right outside the elevator.  We bent over, our heads were probably, I guess, an inch and a half away from each other,  and we were just, oh, oh, oh, just shoveling it in and making noise while he stood there 
[01:11:30]  just looking Asian.  No, like clutons, we weren't just tasting, we went in like, and just destroyed the cheese  and fruit platter.  Just to be obnoxious, he believed you?  He didn't know what to do.  He was like, are you sure it was for Jimmy?  Honestly, we're not.  Because then all of a sudden, that was our goddamn, you son of a bitch.  Well, might I say it was delicious?  Dude, I swear to you, that was our cheese plate.  Did you get a cheese plate with, it looked like a piece of cheese was bitten out of it? 
[01:12:00]  Thank you.  Yeah, because then we're like, oh, that's for us or whatever, right?  And then he turns the corner, we're laughing hysterically.  Next thing you know, the guy's banging on someone's door going room service.  Yeah, our door.  And then all of a sudden we're like, that's when Jimmy and I realize, uh-oh, that might not  be yours.  We hopped on the old elevator.  Hopped on the old elevator and got out of time.  Lips smacking with strawberry treats. 
[01:12:30]  Great.  We went into this.  I'm eating a stale Snyder's pretzel that cost $18 from the mini bar.  We went into this food like pigs.  Just destroyed it in like 10, 15 seconds.  Did you?  And then we organized what was left really fast and then we hit the elevators.  And the last thing we heard was knock, knock, knock, room service.  But if that isn't proof as to what a queer radio show we are, like, rock stars like wreck  hotel rooms, we fold under pressure when Whoopi walks in and our big thrill, we ate some fruit 
[01:13:00]  that might not have been ours.  Rebels.  There's no liquor problems.  There's no fights.  Just us eating fruit and cheese in a naughty fashion and traipsing out of the elevator.  With some maitre d' like guy holding it there for you.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I had more grapes than I should have.  Hey, hey, hey.  Hey, don't call the police.  The other thing really fast.  I'm in Jim Norton's room.  Thanks.  Getting ready to go to Starbucks.  We're all gathering, right?  Is that all that was going on?  And then Lindsey came in and spoiled it.  And then a guy shows up with Jimmy's special pillows. 
[01:13:30]  He can't be on the road.  Oh, we've heard about these special pillows.  Without his special pillows that he requests ahead of time.  I have fruit.  I have to have feather pillows.  I can't sleep on the foam ones.  I just can't do it.  And so I need feather pillows.  So Kenny, of course, will call incessantly.  He needs feather pillows.  He bothers me.  He calls them so much.  But lo and behold, we get there.  There's no feather pillows.  Little goose holocaust going on because of Jimmy just ripping their little feathers out. 
[01:14:00]  Yeah, there's still like blood in the pillows.  They've just slaughtered this thing in the back.  So the guy shows up with the special pillows for Jim Norton.  Don't tell me Jim ate them.  No.  Jim and I decided to try out the pillows in front of the guy.  They were on the bed.  No, no.  It was even better.  So I guess there's a counter in our room or whatever.  So Jimmy places one pillow, even though there's two, one pillow on the counter. 
[01:14:30]  And then he just does the old, like, let your head drop into the pillow like, Sam.  I'm standing.  I put my head on the counter.  I just tilt it.  And he's trying it out, right?  And he goes, I don't know, you know?  So I go, well, let me try.  So I put my head right next to Jimmy's on the same pillow.  And then I put my arm around Jimmy.  And we're trying out the pillows in front of the guy.  I'm like, yeah, but this is not right.  This is just foam.  Nothing about the homosexuality or the two men bent over.  And the guy was just so, because we called down specifically for feather pillows.  And then Idi Amin shows up. 
[01:15:00]  He looked like the African that had the radio show in Hotel Rwanda.  That's where this guy was.  He shows up, and he brings me two more foam pillows.  It's time to cut down the big tree or whatever.  It's the worst code word in history.  Cut down the trees.  Cut down the trees.  Squash the cockroaches.  And he finally brought me my foot.  So nothing but fun.  He should have macheted both of you.  He really should have.  Two little sissies.  All right, so getting back to the Whoopi Goldberg thing real fast. 
[01:15:30]  And we'll put this to bed or to rest or whatever.  The New York Daily News.  Actually, stories all over the place.  But the New York Daily News is the one worth reading.  It's quick, and it's pretty interesting.  It's pretty telling, actually.  So you know the whole Whoopi Goldberg thing by now, hopefully.  If not, you're just screwed at this point.  We can't explain it for the fifth time.  Checking.  Look on the Internet.  The headline, Heart of Goldberg.  Whoopi settles feud.  Heart of Goldberg, huh?  That's the headline. 
[01:16:00]  And they got a picture of Anthony and I and Jim Norton and Whoopi Goldberg in the New York Daily News this morning, okay?  And this is, we're still not thinking as a staff.  We are idiots.  We are idiots.  And gay.  We're self-destructive jackasses who don't know better.  So Whoopi comes in.  Obviously, any picture that is taken is going to be on the Internet.  It's going to be in the paper.  We just know. 
[01:16:30]  We just know when we have something that the media wants.  Stop the presses.  So after we kissed each other's ass for like 40 minutes on our other show, it was time for the photo op.  Yeah.  So we all line up for the photo op and we put on our best smiles.  Me, you, whoopi, a staffer.  A staffer.  Fat intern.  Just poked his head in.  I get your coffee.  Paching.  Oh, am I in that?  And I blame E-Rock today.  Ooh.  And E-Rock takes the photo.  Knowing that, at least at Daily News, because they've been running with this story for the last few days, 
[01:17:00]  because they're on top of things, unlike the New York Post.  I forgive E-Rock because it wasn't zoomed in on just your face.  I was expecting that when E-Rock took the picture.  No whoopi, no nothing, just that smile.  Yeah.  So E-Rock takes the picture, knowing full well that we're going to send this off to all the media outlets immediately, right?  Immediately.  And there in the background is the wall of porn.  Yeah.  We have a wall in our studio that is nothing but nude celebrity women. 
[01:17:30]  Yeah, nude celebrity shots.  And we have, what's her name, Alyssa Milano.  She's prominently displayed, completely naked.  Frolicking in the water.  Frolicking.  There's, God, who else is on that wall?  There's Paris Hilton.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's just.  Yeah, nude celebrity women and just some other, like, hot women from magazines.  And we put them up on the wall.  Anybody that deems a woman hot enough for the wall gets put up there. 
[01:18:00]  That gets a lot of comments when we're on the air.  And XM is uncensored, so we can talk about it pretty graphically.  But we never thought or think when we take pictures with celebrities,  and we always take it with that as a backdrop.  Right.  Because we're not thinking.  And we wonder why, hey, you know, you'd think that picture would have turned up in the paper.  Well, it could be because now it looks like Whoopi and me have dreadlocks,  but it's just the picture behind me.  Someone should have clipped. 
[01:18:30]  I think it's Alyssa Milano coming out of the water.  One of the old school photos.  Jesus.  Is that a sea urchin she picked up?  We're just stupid.  We really are.  But the picture still made the daily news,  and they actually have a very good department over there that, I guess,  photoshops pictures because they photoshopped all the nudity out of the background.  I think they put clothes on one of the girls.  Seriously?  Yeah, like one of the girls has, like, a top on,  and I can't think of any girl that has a top on on that wall. 
[01:19:00]  Well, the original picture is on opianthony.com.  Then you can compare it with the picture that's in the daily news.  See what they did.  And see what they did.  All right, so the New York Daily News with that picture,  Heart of Goldberg, Whoopi settles feud.  And this is where our reputation's on the line.  Once upon a time, there were two radio hosts on WFNY and XM.  Call them Mr. Opie and Mr. Anthony.  This is David Hinckley.  He's warming up to us big time.  He's going to be very disappointed someday that he warmed up to us.  One day, a new radio show came to town. 
[01:19:30]  It was on WKTU.  The host was Miss Goldberg.  Mr. Opie and Mr. Anthony immediately began saying mean things about the new show.  It was too nice, they said, unlike their own show,  which has been called many things but almost never too nice.  But Miss Goldberg did not call them names in return.  Instead, this reads like a fairy tale.  I know, I want to get tucked in and take a little nappy.  And forget the bad thoughts from the past.  Keep everything out of my head. 
[01:20:00]  Instead, yesterday, she knocked on the door of the very messy studio  where they do the XM part of their show each day.  Although they were surprised, they said,  Come in!  They all began speaking, and within minutes they became such good buddies  that listeners half expected them to start painting their toenails together  and telling secrets.  And that's what they should have expected, the way we behaved.  For us is to take our shoes off and paint our toenails.  A nice quarrel, perhaps?  We're shock jocks, dammit.  Ah, sure. 
[01:20:30]  I'm sorry I called you a bitch, said Mr. Opie.  It's okay, said Miss Goldberg, because it's true.  All the people listening to the radio were surprised  because no one imagined that when they all met Miss Goldberg's good manners,  good manners would win out over Mr. Opie and Mr. Anthony's good radio.  Everyone turned their pages.  But they did.  Paging Rodney King.  Apparently we can all get along.  Nice reference from 20 years ago. 
[01:21:00]  91.  It's still a funny one.  Mr. Opie and Mr. Anthony did lament.  So was the video.  I'm sorry, I heard laughter at that Rodney King joke.  I don't need to look to know that it was Kenny and Keith.  Mr. Opie and Mr. Anthony did lament the consequences of this unexpected development.  You just took away all the fun, Mr. Opie told Miss Goldberg.  Who the hell are we going to rag on now, said Mr. Anthony.  Oh, they will find someone. 
[01:21:30]  Meanwhile, for a feud that barely advanced past go,  this one generated a lot of attention.  So they all lived happily ever after.  Thank you, Mr. Rogers.  David Hinckley.  Where is David Hinckley writing?  I don't know, but finally.  Why did he write it like a bedtime story?  I don't know.  Where's my thing?  I need a thing to play the CD.  What, a CD player?  No, I need a thing.  Oh, it's got to go in one of those cases. 
[01:22:00]  Remember these things?  Yeah.  That's the old days.  From when we were rock jocks.  Rock jocks.  Here's the latest from Godsmack on the only station that really rocks.  Are you the only station that really rocks?  Are you?  Because everyone else is playing elevator music, right?  Dopes.  I asked for a thank you from Whoopi Goldberg.  Yeah.  We got it this morning.  We haven't heard this.  We have not heard this at all.  This went down this morning.  You know, it's funny, Whoopi. 
[01:22:30]  Yesterday I asked you if you wanted to have some coffee after the show.  Right.  You're like, now I'm going shopping.  Right.  But you didn't go shopping.  You lied to me.  Well, I didn't.  No, I didn't lie.  I did go shopping.  All right, hold on.  I made a stop first.  I hate to make a stop, but I got...  That's Cubby.  It's her sidekick.  Cubby Bryant.  Yeah.  He's been in New York radio for quite a few years.  You know, a music guy.  Used to be on Z100.  Spin the songs.  And he's the whitest guy ever. 
[01:23:00]  He's like a kind of a cherubish looking guy.  Picture your daughter.  This is exactly who you'd want her to show up with.  Right.  Like a prom date.  Yes.  She'd show up and awkwardly pin the little corsage on her.  Non-threatening.  You know nothing's going to happen that night.  That's right.  Because he's going to be a perfect gentleman.  Yeah.  That's who he is.  He is blackening up by the day just being with Whoopi.  He's trying to like...  You know, he's getting like a dialect. 
[01:23:30]  Recognize.  He said holla the other day.  Holla.  And, mm-hmm, girl.  Like, it does not fit him.  Sorry.  And I'm noticing now during this clip, because that's the guy you hear in this clip, he's  kind of getting into that whole, I believe they call it a wigger.  A vernacular.  Yeah.  Like he's taking on the voice, the dialect.  I didn't catch that.  Yeah, listen.  I didn't catch it.  Yeah, we're going to start off, man.  Listen, now that some of the words trail off in, like, hip-hop fashion. 
[01:24:00]  All right.  I just want to listen to...  The feathers out of your ears.  The technology and the...  Thank you.  I want my thank you.  You know, it's funny, Whoopi.  Yesterday, I asked you if you wanted to have some coffee after the show.  Right.  You're like, now I'm going shopping.  Right.  You're going shopping.  But you didn't go shopping.  You lied to me.  Well, I didn't.  No, I didn't lie.  I did go shopping.  Oh, you did go shopping.  But I made a stop first.  I went and visited O&A, who we're fans of, Opie and Anthony.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes, Opie and Anthony.  And you settled some business.  No, I just...  Actually, what I said to them is that I heard they had been sending out feelers to find out where we were. 
[01:24:30]  And so I went to visit.  And it was quite wonderful.  They're really interesting, nice cats.  And we sat, we laughed, we talked.  I said one or two naughty words because we were on the satellite part.  Right.  And before I left, they said, now, remember, you can't do this tomorrow morning.  Make sure you get your act together.  But it was really great.  It was a great interview.  I heard it.  Oh, did you?  Yeah.  Very funny.  You know, and they said, now, can we still sometimes use this?  I said, yeah, absolutely, absolutely. 
[01:25:00]  So we're doing a shout-out.  Good morning, O&A.  It was a pleasure to see you yesterday.  Damn.  This sucks.  I didn't hear an apology.  Ah, we got another track, and it better be the apology track.  That's right, because we've been wounded.  That's right.  And a thank you.  We were wronged.  I'll accept a thank you.  It's the nerve of her just to start attacking us unprovoked.  You didn't do the weather right is what you...  Oh, oh, really?  Well, I mean, is there, like...  You gave the wrong temperature, which I was just embarrassed to be affiliated with this 
[01:25:30]  show about when you did it.  Oh, I see.  I see you were embarrassed.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay.  Well, okay.  You got your couple of 5,000 on there?  Yeah, yeah.  You've been messing with it, and...  I haven't messed with it.  I touched it twice.  I just don't appreciate you.  I will never touch it again.  You promise?  I swear.  All right.  Well, because you gave the completely wrong temperature.  Okay.  Well, okay, Mr. Kubler.  So, oh, you know, you mad because you didn't go with me yesterday, aren't you?  I'm a little pissed.  I wanted to meet Opie and Anthony.  They were not ready to meet you.  I know.  They don't care about me.  I mean, they weren't ready.  No, they do.  They like you very much. 
[01:26:00]  They actually knew your name.  I'm a fan of them.  I know you are.  I'm a 35-year-old guy.  I'm, like, right in the pocket.  You're the person they're talking to.  Exactly.  And I said to them how much you liked them when, you know, we weren't on the radio.  I said, he likes you so much.  I gave them your number and everything.  Oh, great.  And I just, you know, I just, again, we want to thank those guys for sending folks our way  to watch.  I'm sorry, to watch.  Listen to me.  It's going to take a while for me to realize no one can see us.  There's the thank you.  There's the thank you.  That's all we wanted. 
[01:26:30]  And that ends the saga of Whoopi Gubber.  Does it?  Because I was a little insulted by some of the things she said, and I think wore back  on.  That woman, it's just plain nasty.  That's right.  I didn't care for it.  The way she didn't correct the fact that I'm not a staffer.  All right.  We got to take a break.  We're here for the Opie and Anthony Traveling Virus, the comedy event of 2006.  Tomorrow it begins.  DCU Center in Worcester.  Tickets available through Ticketmaster or at the box office, I'm sure, if you walk right 
[01:27:00]  up tomorrow.  We're giving away tickets in the parking lot of BCN today.  Don't forget, presented by Bud Light, always worth it.  And I want to address this man when we come back.  Oh, crap.  The Lucky Louie thing.  That's fine.  We'll do that next.  I think John Balby is going to be here very, very soon.  We're hoping Andrew Dice Gay makes an appearance today.  We'll see.  I don't want to get too soaked.  What are you talking about?  I don't know.  I don't know what you mean.  What are you talking about?  Don't...  I don't... 
[01:27:30]  How would you get soaked?  Don't ruin it.  I don't know because...  You're going to ruin it.  You're going to ruin it.  Because he sweats so much.  Oh.  You know, when he moves around, he...  You scare me.  ...flames all over.  It's horrible.  I thought you'd tear down the ninth wall there.  Never.  Never.  You wouldn't do that, right?  No.  People really want to believe.  Of course.  They want to believe in Santa Claus.  Shut your eyes and believe.  And they want to believe in Andrew Dice Gay.  They need to believe.  Believe me, they could believe.  Hey, is he making an appearance tomorrow?  I think so.  I hear.  At the Opie and Anthony traveling virus?  He could, if certain things are in order. 
[01:28:00]  Yeah?  Yeah.  A lot of nods around the room.  I know.  I just got a page from ELO.  Staffer.  Thanks.  That's a text message.  That's a text message yesterday.  It's just one word, and it said it all.  Good point.  Staffer.  It's like lethal weapon, too.  Staffer, lover.  Hey, can we get something together for Monday's show?  I got to hear the...  Why should we?  I got to hear the ELO...  I can break ground now.  I got to hear the ELO shirt abuse one more time. 
[01:28:30]  It's very funny.  Can we throw that together into some nice montage?  We killed one of our bosses yesterday.  It's worth replaying again.  Don't we have something going on Monday, too?  What do we have Monday?  Stars coming in.  Oh, yeah.  From 97.  The DJ was fired in New York.  Yeah, yeah.  That's going to be a big...  That's going to be more press for the boys.  We'll see.  All right, it's the ONA virus spreading across America.  Today, we say hi to Boston.  We're live at WBCN.  Go. 
[01:29:00]  That was a clip from Anthony, the retarded half of the Opie and Anthony show.  Opie and Anthony!  No, you got to hit it from there.  Jesus.  Not one time have we even been able to come back from a break to music.  That wasn't my fault, that, though.  Whose fault?  I don't know.  Who do you think? 
[01:29:30]  E-Rock.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  We're live from Boston at WBCN.  By the way, this show's going to hit the road a lot.  We're in Boston today.  We're booked to go to Philly.  Yep.  I hear they're going to start a whole countdown thing.  We're going to be at YSC in Philly.  We're going to be in Cleveland live.  Yes.  And we're starting to pay attention to cities like Pittsburgh and Washington. 
[01:30:00]  Pittsburgh really coming on board.  But guaranteed, we'll be hitting Philly and Cleveland.  All right.  Jim Norton in studio, of course.  Of course.  He's a staffer.  Yeah, I have to correct myself.  I'm such a dope star.  Star was on Power 105, the exact rival of 97.  Oh.  So he's coming in Monday.  Like you would know.  But, I mean, I should know.  No, you shouldn't.  You're right.  We are white people.  You're right.  Good point.  And Star's going to be on our show Monday.  Monday.  He'll come in, yeah.  That's a big, big, big radio story. 
[01:30:30]  Yeah.  And he's coming in to talk to us.  We're sure the Daily News will cover it.  And the Post will talk about something else.  Some kind of transmitter problem that some AM was having out in Montauk.  And there's a review in the Daily News of Lucky Louie.  The guy just smashed it.  But I don't really have a problem with the review.  No?  His name is David Bianculli.  And this is the only part that annoys me.  He thinks the show is astoundingly unfunny.  Lucky Louie on HBO.  He hates it.  Astoundingly.  Yes.  But this is the only part that bothers me.  Because, again, the guy just hates it. 
[01:31:00]  He hates it.  But with a ratio of loud laugh track to horrible writing and acting.  You want to attack the acting, that's cool.  The writing, fine.  I don't really get that.  But go ahead.  But there's no laugh track.  First of all, you fatso.  You look like Paul End.  And you probably have the same sexual practices.  Center square queer.  Have a black hog in his face when he writes.  Yeah.  Okay.  So I see you don't have a problem with the guy.  No, I don't like him.  I don't like his smiling face.  Yeah.  That's the type of face you see on the other end of a glory hole. 
[01:31:30]  Attack it for that, whatever you want.  And then he goes, I watch it each week because it follows two of the best shows on television right now.  And I have a feeling that it must improve, yet it doesn't.  Okay, well, you watch it each week.  Keep giving us numbers, fat boy.  That's all I wanted to say.  I don't care if you hate the show, but don't say there's a laugh track.  Yeah, there isn't a laugh track.  It's a live audience.  Absolutely not a laugh track.  When you hear laugh, it's because people were watching it as it was being taped and laughing.  That is the arrogance of this jerk-off who just doesn't think that people are laughing what he's not laughing at.  So there's no laugh track, fat boy. 
[01:32:00]  Get it right.  That's it.  Critics have no credibility.  Just for the plain fact that it's simple.  It's simple to figure out.  It's on the cover of both of the New York papers today.  The World Trade Center movie.  Daily News.  One critic.  Three and a half teary stars.  That's a pretty good review.  Three and a half stars for WTC.  New York Post.  WTC.  Why I hate this lousy movie. 
[01:32:30]  Now, they have no credibility.  It's all so subjective that they shouldn't even be allowed to write an opinion.  They should be like, they should be allowed to write what the content is and not even voice an opinion on the whole thing because it's so subjective.  I will say though, again, a guy like this, I despise his fat face because it just to me implies a certain sexual orientation.  That's just my opinion.  I don't know anything about the guy. 
[01:33:00]  Wipe that back off.  Then keep writing, fat boy.  Fat boy, your fat yearbook picture.  Hope you get cancer of the tongue.  I thought you weren't bothered.  But I'm not at all.  Not at all.  But just don't lie and say there's a laugh track because there's not.  By the way, getting back to WTC, you know who hates it?  Cindy Adams.  Of course you do because it's not fun and uplifting.  That's probably why she hates it.  She stinks too, man.  Only in New York, kids.  Only in New York. 
[01:33:30]  Her columns stink.  She stinks.  This is what she has to say about one of the biggest stories.  She wants to be the only depressing disaster in New York.  She really is.  This is competition for her.  Stupid picture she's had.  The same staff shot for 40 years.  Ready for this?  More on Hollywood.  Mel Gibson.  Big story, right?  This is what Cindy Adams has to say about it today.  More on Hollywood.  Mel Gibson revealed.  What was that?  I'm sorry.  I just turned to the page and I'm looking at Cindy Adams' picture and I think it was cropped  from one of those pictures at the Overlook Hotel on the wall. 
[01:34:00]  Yeah, there should be a 1921 behind her.  You've always been the caretaker slash unfunny writer here.  Actually, Jack Torrance's book was actually better than what she writes.  I want to smear Avocat on her review.  That's true.  Have Grady remove it and then chop her up.  Then I want to kneel in front of Joey.  I want to lay him back on a bed and kneel in front of him in a bunny outfit.  Her review needs to be corrected.  Well, she is a cook.  Yeah, that picture was taken a long time ago.  So, Mel Gibson, one of the big stories, obviously. 
[01:34:30]  This is what she has to say.  Oh, goody.  This is just terrific.  More on Hollywood.  Mel Gibson revealed a new side of himself.  It was known he was a drinker and a hater, but until he attacked Jews while he was in  a planet Hollywood, which is run by Jews, we hadn't realized he was also stupid.  So, people ask, will this hurt his career?  Who knows?  We can only hope so.  We can only hope so.  That's what she has to say about Mel Gibson. 
[01:35:00]  First of all, it's not going to hurt his career.  The guy pretty much alienated himself from the Jewish Hollywood community with a passion,  which made huge amounts of money.  He's very rich.  He could finance anything he wants.  He could put out movies.  People are still going to see him because, you know why his career won't end?  Because I had a phone call last night with my mommy, and she's all up in arms that people  are up in arms about Mel Gibson.  She goes, I still love the guy.  I would see anything he does. 
[01:35:30]  I don't care what he says.  I don't care what his ideology is, what he thinks about the Jewish people.  It doesn't matter to me.  And my mother is exactly what Mel wants going to his movies.  So, not even a problem.  This guy will be fine.  He wants hot, older broads to go to his movies?  Easy now, my friend.  That's my mommy you're talking about.  We love your mommy.  She's fantastic.  Don't call my mom.  Don't treat my mom like a cougar.  We love your mommy.  Mom's no cougar.  But she, you know, and that's exactly the mindset of a lot of women out there that are just 
[01:36:00]  like, they don't care.  They don't care what this guy says.  He didn't call me fat.  I'll go to see his movies.  The way it will hurt his career, I think this is a bad one, man, because it was such a vicious  attack on Jews.  That's why he came right out and apologized in a groveling fashion and ran into rehab  because even Mel Gibson, the studios can shut out.  What's going to go?  What studios?  Or the theaters.  They can. 
[01:36:30]  Do you really think?  They tried with the passion.  They pegged them as a...  Oh, nice.  Got a keyboard there from John.  That's all right.  I liked it for the musical background.  You needed to do that at that moment in the middle of an unbelievable Mel Gibson rant?  Here's the thing.  They can't like...  Look, when Dice was at the top of his game, the women's group's protest shut him down.  They just paid him all his money.  I mean, they will shut you down if they want to.  I don't care who you are. 
[01:37:00]  The passion was at least...  Dice doesn't have umpteen billion dollars and women loving him all over the place.  The passion was at least a film that could...  Well, no, I wasn't trashing the Jews.  Yes, you were.  No, I wasn't.  I was just being accurate.  So that was like a whole religious issue.  But this was such a blatant...  There's no denying it.  The Jews start the wars.  There was no hiding what he was trying to say.  This is one that's kind of hard to cover.  I'm telling you, man.  Yeah.  If they get pissed off enough at something so blatant and so vile to them, they can shut you down.  I hear if you just give them money, everything's fine. 
[01:37:30]  Yeah, absolutely.  That actually does work.  It's a couple of few bucks.  He was just drinking?  Hey, speaking of Mel Gibson...  I'm not a big fan of Rob Schneider's, but he did something very, very funny about the Mel Gibson.  Did you read this?  Yeah.  This is hilarious.  Rob Schneider is really upset with Mel Gibson and his anti-Semitic remarks.  Actually, this full-page ad in today's Variety from Rob Schneider that plainly states that he will never, ever work with Mel Gibson under any circumstances is what tells me that he is really upset with Mel Gibson. 
[01:38:00]  That is very funny.  Yeah.  See, because Rob Schneider would never be asked to work with Mel Gibson.  Of course not.  Hey, let's say hi to John Valby.  Yes.  John, I'm going to attempt to turn on another mic here.  Uh-oh, this could be a catastrophe.  John?  Yeah.  There he is.  That's on.  You're on.  Yeah, hello.  How you been, man?  I've been good.  How you been?  Good.  I haven't seen you in a while. 
[01:38:30]  Last time was in New York.  You stopped in.  Didn't have a keyboard with you, but thank God we were in the Steinway building.  Yes, I remember as well.  In New York.  Very stuffed shirt.  I mean, it's the Steinway building.  You shouldn't even have to describe it to people.  The first floor, huge room, very classy, full of Steinway pianos, and a lot of stuffed shirts in there.  And John went downstairs.  Because he didn't have a piano. 
[01:39:00]  Because he didn't have a piano, and we were like, he's got to do some of his songs.  Maybe he could just kind of slip into Steinway.  Well, a lot of people don't know his background.  He is one of the best pianists ever.  This guy is amazing.  Here, play something real.  And classically.  What the hell sound is that?  Wow.  All right, wait a minute.  Oh, classic.  Yeah.  Bring me some mead. 
[01:39:30]  This song was so overrated.  That Bach guy, he never had something good.  His name alone.  Blech.  Hey, do you have something from this century?  Hey, I've been a fan of Valby's.  I'm 38.  Probably since I'm about 13 or 14.  Yeah, absolutely.  And I would listen to the stuff on there.  He would always have a serious piece, too. 
[01:40:00]  As well as the filthiest, funniest stuff you've ever heard.  And they would always be like, a serious piano piece, too.  And I would always dig those as much as the other stuff.  The guy had to eat is what the story is.  I mean, you're incredibly talented as a musician.  And then it's like, all right, how can I make money?  Ah, I'll play filthy songs on my piano.  And I mean, I remember going to some of the clubs down on Long Island.  Baby Huey's and Tooey's and all these places. 
[01:40:30]  Tooey's.  He used to talk it.  Oh, man.  He used to talk it.  And just a bunch of sweating people hanging out in these clubs, just screaming back at  the stage, packed.  Horrionally imbalanced.  Exactly.  And having a great time.  Man, you just, you know how to make a crowd jump up and have fun, man.  Getting back to the last visit or one of the last John Valby visits, he didn't have his  keyboard.  Yeah.  And we had the, like Ann said, we're in the Steinway building and these pianos, they sell 
[01:41:00]  down there.  Top of the line, thousands and thousands.  What would you say that the piano that you played would go for?  Oh, $100,000.  $100,000.  Are you serious?  Oh, yeah.  Huge grand piano.  It's a showroom.  Yeah.  And only special people go in there.  Like Ann said, everyone.  You can't just sit down and go, hey, can I play, you know?  And everyone's really, really stuffy in there.  Yeah.  And their noses are up in the air.  And we talked them into having, letting John Valby play one of the pianos on our show.  Because he was able to sit down and play a piece that was beautiful.  Yeah.  And just doodle a little. 
[01:41:30]  Yeah.  Doodle around.  Right.  And they're like, okay, this guy knows what he's doing.  It's safe.  He's not going to take a sledgehammer to this thing.  You don't look like a classical pianist, I mean, to look at you.  I mean, anyone that can see John knows, he just doesn't look like the type of guy that  can sit down and play Bach.  So, somehow we...  He looks like the type of guy that gets out of a car after a family has been mowed down  and says, I don't know what happened, as a Michelob bottle falls out.  So, somehow we pulled it off and we got John to play.  And everyone started gathering around in the store, people that were looking at piano. 
[01:42:00]  They were very impressed.  Yeah, yeah.  Wow, look at this guy play.  And then all of a sudden, Ant and I...  Because we were spending that time also to get the cell phone, because that's all we  had at the time, hook up, and get him on the phone line so we could then go, okay,  drop the bomb.  Right.  Go into Dr. Dirty mode.  So, we came to the cue and then he just turned like a switch.  Went into his, you know, at the gangbang, one of those things.  And it was just one of his, you know, classic Dr. Dirty songs.  It's a horror that ensued. 
[01:42:30]  It's a horror-fied people in this most stuffy Steinway building.  You know, we're in a weird position today, because we're live from BCN.  Yeah.  And we're going to do the walkover and all that when we continue on XM, but maybe right  at 9 o'clock, we can play that John Valby bit or something.  I'd love to hear it again.  Why don't we play that, and then, you know, after that, we'll come back live.  I think that makes sense today.  Yeah.  Especially because we just explained it, and there's a lot of new listeners that have never heard  it.  All right?  Yes.  John Valby's playing the Comedy Connection here in Boston at Faneuil Hall. 
[01:43:00]  Well, nice.  Just tonight?  Tonight, yeah.  Just tonight.  And, you know, if a tile falls on your head, you get in free.  So calm down.  I know what's going on.  That's another beauty of you.  There's nothing, whether it's Nancy Reagan's physical ailments or Reagan's colon, there's  nothing he hasn't gone after.  No.  That's the beauty.  Nothing.  The more tragic and awful it is, the more vengeance he has with it.  Nothing's safe.  Yeah.  I love it.  That's why we love him.  It's just great.  And, John, you don't have to say something. 
[01:43:30]  I don't want to put you on the spot, but we're doing this O&A Traveling Virus thing,  and we've got a bunch of dates.  We'd like you to jump on board a little bit.  Hey, that sounds good.  We're going to have our people talk to your people, see if we can work that out.  Yeah, at least for one or two, yeah, a couple of shows.  Your people.  Are you your people?  Yeah, right.  You're talking to my people.  And there's our people.  Yeah.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  I used to be a cop.  God, that should be a wonderful negotiation.  Could you make it?  Okay.  So, did John Valby try to play some stuff or what? 
[01:44:00]  Now, this is the dilemma we've always been in with John.  We want to be his friend so bad, and we want to do a lot of radio with him.  But his songs, not very conducive to broadcast radio.  Well, is there a five-second delay?  I'm not sure how many seconds there are.  Because we have a guy on the button, we just don't know how it works between here and here.  No, I can get rid of all the really bad words, but some of them I think are good, sometimes don't end up being good. 
[01:44:30]  You know what?  The ones you think sometimes are good are probably always not on radio these days.  It's gotten to the point where, hmm.  They think bad.  No.  No, they just don't.  You know something?  You used to be able to.  And in certain contexts, you can.  I love the people that come into our show and think they can whisper something.  Like, yeah.  Can you say, and then he says the word, but he's whispering.  And it's over the thing anyway.  So you think it's okay?  Well, you could say, I could say, Jimmy pissed me off so bad last night by eating my cheese platter that was meant for me as room service. 
[01:45:00]  That you could say.  You just can't say it in another context.  Right.  Which I think you're not.  Yeah, this is not that kind of thing.  Oh, okay.  John Balby, everyone.  What gas today costs more than a piece of ass today.  My effing Chevy sucks up half my pay.  The other half I piss away.  Right.  Was that legal?  Was that legal? 
[01:45:30]  Yeah, I think so.  Get on the phone with New York.  Was that legal?  I don't even know.  I think so, because it wasn't used in the literal sense.  Do you have anything on Heather Mills?  Heather Mills, I don't.  Oh, you got to go after McCartney's wife with the one-legged.  Yeah, many years ago, but I definitely couldn't do that one.  Yeah.  I can only imagine.  Yeah.  That's with the dump guy.  Just be careful.  If you hear something coming, like, I told her not to bunt, the next line will probably be dumped. 
[01:46:00]  And she's using her leg at the back.  Is it this word?  Hit.  I, I'm hit.  Out of luck, like I told my girlfriend Liz.  This old pickup truck guzzles gas like she does.  Okay.  Hey, can we play this game?  An example, an example of what you're...  Yeah.  That is perfect, yeah.  All right, that's how we play. 
[01:46:30]  Can we play this game?  Yeah, why not?  New York will let us play this game.  Absolutely.  All right, John, do it that way.  Do it that way, because that's really funny.  That is really funny.  It's obvious what it is.  Right.  Not to me, it's not.  So, of course, it's not.  Not to most people.  I couldn't really figure that one out.  No.  I couldn't.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Fizz.  She likes salt.  Right.  One of my favorite things you did, you can never do it on commercial radio, but he did  a parody of Billy Joel's Woman.  It was on what I did with my summer vacation, and it is just brilliant and filthy and vile. 
[01:47:00]  It really makes me happy.  I wish I could do it.  You know, I feel so...  Well, you know what?  We're going to continue on XM, and then you can just let it fly.  Oh.  Yeah, that's, you know...  Awesome.  Once we hit a certain hour, all bets are off.  Yeah.  No FCC.  You know, I have a subject.  There's no dirty words, but it's a low-life subject.  I've never picked on handicapped people before. 
[01:47:30]  Oh.  And this guy in Tampa, Florida, in the chair, said, how come you never pick on us?  And he felt left out.  Want me to do it?  You took care of it?  Sure.  You did.  Oh, I don't know.  That might be in poor taste.  Yeah, Jim.  John Balby.  Who can go to Disney World?  Cutting every line.  Gets the best parking spot every freaking time.  The handicapped can, and we're picking on him because he asked me to. 
[01:48:00]  Who can eat his dinner while he takes a dump?  Grabbed the mashed potatoes and stirs them with his stump.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We'll pick it up.  He asked me, too.  How about this?  Hair lips, hair lips, club foots, crips, and the tarts.  Though I say I'm glad to see ya.  I really wouldn't want to be ya. 
[01:48:30]  You're as welcome here as diarrhea.  Who can take a feeding tube.  Who can take a feeding tube.  Clog it up with spit.  And when you clean his bag, he goes and takes another.  And you can't get it.  And we're picking on him because he asked me to.  Ah, John Valby, yes.  Comedy Connection tonight here in Boston.  Ah, we should take a break.  We'll take a little break. 
[01:49:00]  Stirring potatoes with his stump.  Oh, that's good.  All right.  When we get back, we'll talk to Ralphie May.  He's playing the ONA Traveling Virus tomorrow at the DCU Center in Worcester.  Tickets still available.  We'll see what he's up to.  And more songs from John Valby, all right?  That's great, man.  It's the ONA Virus spreading across America.  Today, we're live in Boston.  Shuffle, shuffle, shuffle, shuffle.  Shuffle, shuffle, shuffle, shuffle, shuffle.  Oh, my goodness.  Shuffle, shuffle, shuffle, shuffle, shuffle. 
[01:49:30]  Shuffle, shuffle.  Opie and Anthony.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Yeah!  You did it.  It worked.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The ONA Virus.  Spreading across America.  Live from WBCN in Boston.  Having a lot of fun.  These guys set us up right.  You can feel the passion at BCN.  Oh, yeah.  It's a different BCN.  They're really, really into the Opie and Anthony Show.  Seems like they're really, really into the station in general. 
[01:50:00]  We got listeners outside the studio.  They're all getting tickets to the ONA Traveling Virus tomorrow at the DCU Center in Worcester.  They're going to hire Mark Perino back, I heard, over here.  No.  Oh, that wasn't on.  Sorry, Anthony.  Yeah, there you go.  I heard he's getting sprung from the joint. 
[01:50:30]  I thought maybe...  Well, they're actually going to hire him to go around and give PSA tests.  This is what we're going to do after the show.  And I'm hearing BCN is going to work with us a little bit today.  Every day we leave a lot of our audience behind and we continue on XM.  BCN is going to continue broadcasting after 9 o'clock for a little bit today.  And we're going to go walk to IHOP and buy most of our listeners' breakfast.  What guys we are.  Except for Sonny Pirelli. 
[01:51:00]  Yeah, really.  He looks like a large stack of hotcakes kind of guy.  By the way, the ONA Traveling Virus, presented by Bud Light, always worth it.  John Balby in studio.  He's playing the Comedy Connection in Faneuil Hall here in Boston tonight.  Yes.  Are you playing tomorrow night?  Uh, Chick-A-Pete in the Hooky Loud tomorrow in Chick-A-Pete.  Hey, don't Chick-A-Pete.  You're not allowed to promote that show.  Hooky Loud!  You're a competition tomorrow.  You can't promote that show. 
[01:51:30]  You're in Springfield tomorrow?  Uh, we're in Worcester.  Worcester.  Oh, that's fair enough.  Worcester.  I'm just kidding with you, man.  Worcester.  You gotta...  You always mess with me and I don't even know it.  I like it that way.  I know.  You like it that way.  You're a little puppet string, man.  Is the Connection sold out tonight or you don't know?  It's got to be sold out.  It will be.  Tonight.  And on XM, we gotta push the Hooky Loud.  See?  Yeah, yeah.  Hooky Loud.  Hooky Loud.  Hooky Loud.  All right, we'll do that because John Valvey's gonna continue with us. 
[01:52:00]  You got a song for this side of the show?  Let me try.  You've been talking football a little while ago.  Baseball, you've been talking.  Well, how about...  Oh, his name is Big Papa.  Today's the front of the space.  That's what August 5th, the Yankees are in first place.  Some of us put the pitchers.  Some of us put the luckers.  But remember, even with Johnny Damon, the Yankees suck.  Are you allowed to say that? 
[01:52:30]  Yes.  Sure.  Especially in this city.  Yeah.  That's an easy one.  Boy, way to go after tough targets in Boston.  Wow.  Really put yourself out there, John.  All right.  How about all...  My name's Ben Roethlisberger.  I broke my effin' jaw.  I broke my steak and a blender.  My meat was really strong.  My meat got caught in the training wheels.  My nuts got caught in the chain.  But I didn't need a helmet.  I'm a stealer. 
[01:53:00]  No effin' brain.  Oh, there goes our Pittsburgh audience.  John.  Hey.  We're doing very well at Pittsburgh, and we want to keep it like that.  Every city I go to, I pick on their guys, you know?  Of course.  Of course he does.  Oh, sorry, Pittsburgh.  Jason Giambi is gonna...  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Mm-hmm.  I think Yankees are gonna do it, don't you?  Absolutely.  I hope not.  He's the only Yankee I don't hate.  Giambi.  It's gonna be the Mets this year.  Let's go, Mets.  Mets, Red Sox, 20 years later. 
[01:53:30]  Wow.  What do you say?  What do you say?  I beat all for it.  Oh.  Let's say hi to Ralphie May real fast.  Ralphie May is part of the...  Let's go, Mets, go.  Can't wait to hear the song they come up with.  Ugh.  The Mets are the worst with their publicity songs.  They really are.  Ralphie!  Let's go, Mets, go.  Uh, Ralphie!  Ralphie.  Ralphie, come in.  Come in, Ralphie.  Uh, Ralphie May.  Sweetie.  Come in, Ralphie, over.  Ralphie!  Ralphie May.  Oh, boy.  We need the BCN guy.  We haven't gotten any phone calls there, right?  That's quite sweet.  Ralphie May. 
[01:54:00]  Or may not be on the phone.  Ralphie!  Ralphie May.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, wait.  Maybe this?  Yeah, I hear.  Ralphie!  Ralphie!  I hear him in one headphone.  Ralphie!  Yeah.  Is this going to be, like, echoey like this?  Ralphie May, everyone.  We're having trouble with the phones here.  We haven't gone to them yet.  Hey, Ralphie.  Hey, what's going on, kids?  Oh, this is going to stink.  Yeah, we can't hear you.  Am I doing this right, Phil?  Mr. Can you fix it, mister? 
[01:54:30]  I'm hearing six of you.  You're hearing six of us?  Ralphie, how about that?  That would be right.  Ralphie?  Yeah, I got you.  Yeah, but this is going to stink.  We can't hear you.  We have you, like, in one channel coming.  There's something with the phone connection that's not working.  Oh, these phones stink.  It's in New York.  Ralphie!  That's what they're saying.  Are you in L.A. right now, or are you on the East Coast?  I'm on the West Coast.  I'm about to get on an airplane.  Oh, you're coming tonight.  Okay.  Ralphie, why are you trying to take Genesis from us? 
[01:55:00]  It's a Star Trek joke.  Eight people are laughing their asses off.  Believe me.  Trust me on this.  Hold on.  We're trying to fix this, Ralph.  Ralphie!  Yeah.  That was John's keyboard.  I got the piano already.  He just fell asleep on the keyboard.  It's degradable.  When your mom finds out your girlfriend is inflatable.  It's deplorable. 
[01:55:30]  But I find her plastic sphincter just adorable.  I'll admit it.  Though her moo isn't furry like a kitten,  I can mmm update mmm without her mmm.  He's learning!  Oh, I'm going to fall away.  Wow, kitten.  He's learning!  Oh, is that good?  Kitten, yeah.  I was wondering where you were going. 
[01:56:00]  I bet you they still panicked in New York.  No, they didn't.  Oh, of course.  No way, because you want to be learning.  Al Dukes is sweating.  He is sweating today.  Well, thank you, Ralphie May, for checking in.  What can I tell you?  Is that it?  Sorry, Ralph.  Hello?  We'll have phones with him tomorrow.  Someone let him know that we didn't screw with him.  It's just we honestly can't hear him.  No, not at all.  Sorry about that.  And by the way, we wanted to take a...  Sorry about that.  We wanted to talk about that.  We wanted to have a phone call from Philly today as well,  but the phones aren't working.  So, Club Soda Kenny, what was the big news in Philly again?  Oh, go ahead, Kenny. 
[01:56:30]  We were going to have Tanya, a hot piece of ass, give the info,  but the phones aren't working, so now Club Soda Kenny has them.  He's our hot piece of ass.  Go, sweetie.  He sure is.  Look at him bent over like that.  Those laughs showing.  Thank you.  The lawn seats in Camden.  All right, let's buy lawn seats, people.  Come on, spend your money.  Come see some handsome and talented people at the show.  Buy lawn seats.  Wow, what a master salesman you are.  Isn't he just the best? 
[01:57:00]  At the Tweeter Center in Camden, the lawn seats.  Oh, my God.  You didn't even...  Wait, hold on.  This is just to wake people up from that.  Yeah, you didn't even tell people why it's important to buy lawn seats this weekend.  Tell them, sweetie.  That was the big promotion.  Yeah, Kenny, the big promotion.  The lawn seats are only $10 for the weekend.  Only the weekend.  If you get them today, tomorrow, or Sunday, they're $10.  Starting Monday, they're going to go to $20.  That was the big news.  Yeah, Kenny.  That's why you're the star of the radio show.  You and Anthony and Jimmy.  Oh, thanks.  Jimmy's a staffer. 
[01:57:30]  I'm a staffer.  You know, I'm just like, you know, fodder for you guys.  No, no, no.  You're not.  You're not a fodder.  You're a good boy.  You're more like a mutter.  His mutter.  His fodder was a mutter.  My fodder bore me matter to my mutter.  He, mm, from his mm.  He, he, he.  This is Kersh.  All right.  I like just using the mm.  That was great.  So the, yeah, the lawn seats in Camden went on sale, the Tweeter Center today, and they 
[01:58:00]  are $10 all weekend, and they're $20.  We were hoping to get $10.  Or Mel Gibson will comment on you.  We were hoping to get 10 minutes out of Ralphie May instead.  You get this horse crap.  Just us making things up as we go along.  You don't know what we're talking about.  No.  John Valleby's thinking of doing another song that he could, he could play on this side  of the show.  I don't know.  These songs.  Oh, I'm George W. Bush.  My second term is turning to crap.  If only Cheney had let my nuke, I ran off the heffin' back. 
[01:58:30]  Well, listen up, Hezbollah, because here's the latest news.  Israel's turning Lebanon into a parking lot for Jews.  I don't know, you know.  Look at him.  He gets all bummed out.  You're doing great, man.  I know.  Please.  He hits, this is what I love about Valby.  It's always topical, man.  Everything that's going on is just getting smashed.  Yep.  I love it.  Although I don't appreciate that type of situation being put on that.  Steve, what's this?  It's the old-time 40s-style audio. 
[01:59:00]  The Vingo?  What the hell is the Vingo?  It's one of those old-timey 40s PSAs where they're trying to encourage women to get a  certain proactive haircut because it's more positive.  What?  I don't know.  Danny sent it over this morning.  And it's real?  Let Kenny explain it.  Or is it like he's going to do that?  He's going to do better than that?  You know as he goes, I don't know, Danny sent it over.  Yeah, yeah.  Notice the subtle passing of the buck.  Exactly.  Everyone does that when they're not sure of how something's going to work out, if it's 
[01:59:30]  going to bomb or not, they pass it on and go, Danny gave me this, or Than came up with  this, or this one.  And then when it's successful, then it's, oh, see what I brought to the table?  Well, what do you think?  Did Steve have any comment on that audio?  Let me see.  Steve, what do you think of the audio?  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  Oh.  Maybe it's not that good.  That's my favorite clip of all time.  All right.  You want to hear it?  Of course.  This is the Vingo.  Well, I've never heard of this.  I've never heard of this either. 
[02:00:00]  The Vingo hairstyle.  The shortcut for victory.  If your war job is where the wheels are turning, it's only common sense to play for safety and  keep your hair short.  Believe you me, a hair on the head's worth two in the machinery.  While you're having a cut, why not have it made attractive also?  A mob cap isn't enough.  Hair can still escape and cause untold trouble.  I get it. 
[02:00:30]  The partings form four Vs.  Hence, V-ingle.  Vingo.  You should bear in mind some of the other troubles due to long hair at war work.  Dust, grit, and powder may get into the hair, causing most distressing skin complaints.  Negro.  Though you may be giving your services to the war effort, there's no reason why you should  give your complexion, too.  Looks well, doesn't it?  No.  And now I hope you'll forgive me for breaking into rhyme.  If you'd avoid a bad scalp tingle, take care of your hair. 
[02:01:00]  The answer's Vingo.  Wow.  So they're telling the women to cut their hair so when they're working in the factories  churning out some bombs and stuff, you don't get your hair stuck in the machines.  That ad was sponsored by the lesbians of America.  Yeah.  That was the beginning of the lesbian movement right there.  They were able to cut their hair in the Vingo and never went back.  Never looked back.  Short hair.  And have sun-kissed.  Wait.  No.  Star-kissed.  Star-kissed.  Oh, boy.  Just dead. 
[02:01:30]  Oh, wow.  That wasn't even a car crash.  That was a sputter out and die of exhaust fumes.  Let's say hi to Ralphie May again.  Ralphie.  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  There he is.  Look at us figuring out stuff on the fly.  So, Ralphie, you're at the airport?  Yeah.  I'm at U.S. Airways right now trying to get my bag put on the airplane.  All right.  So you're coming into Boston.  Ralphie.  Yeah.  You bought two seats, right?  No, I got one first-class seat. 
[02:02:00]  Ah, first-class.  First-class.  They embarrass overweight guys in the back of the plane.  Make them buy two seats.  I don't care.  They can say, oh, you got a guy in two seats.  It's like, okay.  Better that than hearing the whimpering of the dumb-dumb who's got the middle seat.  You know?  Better than that.  Well, you're famous enough to fly first-class.  Does USA always have a good first-class?  Because a lot of them are just awful.  No, it's not bad.  It's not continental by any stretch of the imagination, but it's not bad. 
[02:02:30]  Well, I'm just saying, I want to be delicate about this, but do you know that I was in first-class one time,  and there was a non-white sitting next to me?  Unbelievable.  I won't even embarrass the airline by mentioning their name.  Jesus.  Hey, hey, it's Boston.  We're in Boston.  Oh, I forgot.  We're taking on the attitude.  Anything goes.  Anything goes.  I got one along that line. 
[02:03:00]  Oh, do we have?  All the doors open.  There we go.  Hold on, Robbie.  Hurricane Katrina began to stir about.  Down came the rain and washed the darkies out.  They moved into Texas, committed lots of crime.  We ought to make them work in a West Virginia mine.  Oh, check, please.  Oh, boy, my bags.  I think I'm checking out. 
[02:03:30]  That's just fantastic.  John Valby, the Comedy Connection tonight here in Boston.  So you know where to shoot them.  Wow.  That was great.  Hey, Ralphie, you looking forward to tomorrow?  Yeah, man.  It's going to be awesome.  I can't wait.  Dude, are you flying in and out?  Are you staying in town for a little while?  I'm not in town until, yeah.  No, it's not.  I'm in town until Tuesday, so I'm around.  All right.  Well, you should come in.  Yeah, come on in. 
[02:04:00]  We'll be back in New York on Monday.  Come on in.  He's buying the tickets.  He's checking in.  He's buying it in cash, first class, like all the hours.  No, stupid.  No, stupid.  Boston.  Ralphie.  Yeah.  Be nice to us, or we're going to make you go on last tomorrow.  I thought that's the way it was.  All the comedians are talking.  They're like, who's going to have to go last?  I don't care.  Yeah, whoever it is will do fine, man.  Jeez, thanks for going with it, Jimmy.  I was just mad.  Oh, you know what?  You're right.  That really was. 
[02:04:30]  What a literal ass I am.  Oh, no.  All kidding aside.  Yuck.  I know.  I don't recognize my puppet strings.  All right.  Ralphie, have a good flight.  We'll see you tomorrow.  All right, baby.  Goodbye, pumpkin.  All right.  Bye, guys.  We should have made him hand the phone to the person he's talking to and then go, yes,  he has a bum in his bag.  He's like, just totally screw up his hole.  But they would recognize him and go, yes, we know.  We saw last comic standing.  Oh.  What?  That's not. 
[02:05:00]  Ralph was very funny.  I just made a little.  That was hurtful.  You did hurt.  You were hurtful.  It was very hurtful.  I wasn't trying to be hurtful.  I happen to like Ralphie.  You were another comedian.  You were very hurtful.  No, I wasn't.  We're doing a nice show.  This is nice Friday.  Nice?  Did you hear that last song?  What's wrong with that?  It was a nice song.  All right.  We got to leave.  He's offering them a place to go and a job.  I had no idea.  There were people.  This is what I got from his song.  People were displaced by Hurricane Katrina.  Right.  They gave them another place to live in another state. 
[02:05:30]  Right.  And offered them work.  Yep.  That was a very uplifting song that you just sang there.  I liked it.  Yep.  All right.  This is what we're going to do.  We got to leave this side of the show.  We're going to continue on XM.  But I think BCN is going to stay with us for a little while.  Oh, they are.  Are they?  We're going into the parking lot.  And whoever's out there, we're walking IHOP with them.  I guess the Patriots cheerleaders are out there.  Oh, they are.  Going to have a nice parade to IHOP.  And then we're going to buy everyone breakfast and continue broadcasting our stupid show. 
[02:06:00]  Yeah.  I pulled the pants right down.  What'd you get?  With Cape Cod and some underwear sweat.  The dark buckling.  Blair lost control button.  Meat stood up like a telephone pole.  I don't know, John.  I don't know if that one will make the cut.  That's very funny. 
[02:06:30]  That's right.  It's local Cape Cod.  He was starting to feel good about himself.  He's like, what the hell?  I'll try this one.  I like that.  All right.  We've got to get out of here.  What else do we have to plug?  The Palm for giving us breakfast?  Oh, yeah.  Very good.  Best fruit anywhere.  Oh, The Palm restaurant here in Boston took care of us big time with lobster and steak and everything else.  The Palm, the perfect place to celebrate.  Boston Palm, 617-867-9292.  Or go to thepalm.com. 
[02:07:00]  All right.  We've got to wrap up?  Yes, we do.  All right.  Thank you, Boston.  Thank you, everybody.  Have a great weekend.  If you're not joining us on...  And Portland!  XM.  Yes.  Portland.  Bye-bye.  We'll see you.  Opie and Anthony show.  Most of us get here on time.  We're just fat guys on the air.  We are so pathetic.  We're fancy, fancy people.  It's the battle of the mental illness.  We are going to dumb this thing down to the point that we're going to be number one with Down Syndrome children. 
[02:07:30]  It's showtime, folks.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  You'll love us.  Opie and Anthony.  The Opie and Anthony show.  The Opie and Anthony.  XM.  The Opie and Anthony XM walkover begins now. 
[02:08:00]  Do you hear someone?  I hear you.  Oh, I don't hear anything.  I hear you and I hear music.  What about Jimmy Norton?  Stafford Jimmy doesn't get a mic.  I don't hear anything.  Oh, the sun's zipped.  We're on?  Oh, we're actually on? 
[02:08:30]  Like this is it?  Like this is it.  This is what they get?  My headphones are not working, so I'm failing.  If someone could get these to work, then give them back to me.  But we're live outside WBCN.  We're about to meet the tens of fans that came here to support us today.  You know what?  At least one of you was driving around for an hour and couldn't find the place.  So a lot of people don't know where this place is.  We're going to tell ourselves.  By the way, lucky me, because I said I'd buy breakfast for everyone that showed up.  And it looks like I have to buy breakfast for 10 people. 
[02:09:00]  I really wish a busload of like fucking 50 also fans would have showed up.  I think we're on WBCN also.  Really?  Yeah, with your potty mouth.  I hope they have a dump button here.  Yeah, they do.  It's all right.  So we forgot to give it the big plug, by the way, at the end of the first half of the show.  The big O&A traveling virus tomorrow at the DCU Center in Worcester.  Tickets still available through Ticketmaster.com.  They just played Valby's appearance on the XM show last time.  Is that your thumbs up?  No, that was just on XM, and then they played music here. 
[02:09:30]  I know.  Oh, is that why Lenny Cavs is playing?  Yeah.  Wake up, Jimmy!  I forgot how funny that bit was.  I'm standing there with Valby listening to it.  It's so filthy.  It's really brutal and great.  Yeah, hysterically funny and filthy.  And just the fact that he did it in the Steinway building is hysterical.  Yeah.  He goes into...  Because he's playing such beautiful classical music.  And then he just...  You hear...  And you know it's just going to get raunchy. 
[02:10:00]  Yeah.  Hey, where'd your mic go, Opie?  There it is.  There it is.  We're sharing mics and all that.  By the way, that John Valby bit, you can find it somewhere on the internet.  Maybe oavirus.com or go to one of our fan sites,  and they'll help you find it.  Because a lot of people didn't hear that today.  No.  This is...  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Oh, wow!  All right!  This is a nice crowd out here.  More than I thought there'd be.  Yeah, more than I thought.  But I love the fact that all the empty tables... 
[02:10:30]  Yeah.  Oh, we really are.  Oh, God.  What a collection of zolties you love.  It's like visiting day at, like, the old age home.  Yeah.  No one cares to come to see Grandma.  That's right.  This is one pair of, uh...  One pair of white stockings that are, uh...  Kind of torn, thanks to the orderly fling-wigs.  Male nurse with a pillow in his hand,  assisting families if they don't want the burden anymore.  Oh, dude.  I just realized that half of the people outside are BCN staffers.  Oh, okay.  All right.  Now I know why.  They're actually filler for this sit-top. 
[02:11:00]  Filler.  Oh.  Look at the T-shirt, Jimmy.  Uh, Ozzy effing Osborne.  Trying to keep it clean because we're still on BCN right now.  Obviously, uh, it's spelled out on the guy's shirt.  Very nice.  Have a good walkover.  Enjoy yourselves.  That's really fun.  All right, let's walk.  Are we, uh, walking?  And now, how is this going to work?  Is it...  Are we actually going to be able to broadcast?  I don't know.  Has this been tested?  This is the beauty of satellite.  We don't know.  All right.  All right, look.  Uh, it's not what we expected.  Get outside and just act like you're fans in your ties. 
[02:11:30]  Yeah.  We're all calling their friends and family.  Could you hurry up and get down to BCN?  We got to make it look good for the guys.  Oh, gosh.  You don't need to make it look good.  We know exactly what we are.  We're excited.  Dude, they thought it was going to be like a big thing.  And then, oh, look.  I see a tent.  Hey, hey, hey.  We thought it was going to be a big thing.  No, we knew.  See for yourself, we certainly didn't.  We know we're just...  There's a tent and there's like...  There's one hot chick sitting alone under a tent. 
[02:12:00]  Oh.  What is she, a cheerleader?  Is that what that is?  Yeah.  Oh, she's a cheerleader.  Of course.  Wow.  All right, let's...  Well, let's walk across the parking lot.  One cheerleader showed up.  Raw, raw.  We have to do something.  I don't mean assault, necessarily.  Necessarily.  Let's go talk to the one cheerleader.  Yeah, let's talk to her.  That was brave enough to show up outside WBCN today.  Oh, what?  Get out of the way.  We got to walk.  Trying to wade through our fans here. 
[02:12:30]  And did it start raining?  Yeah.  Jesus Christ.  We can blame it on the rain.  Yeah.  Can anything work?  We're always looking for an excuse, so we'll blame it on the rain.  Look, the tables are still wet.  Yeah, they're a little wet.  So it kept people home today.  That must be it.  Oh, by the way, as you walk across the parking lot, you can tell which ones are fans  and which ones were the BCN staff that came out to make it look good.  Yeah.  Yes.  Because the staff is wearing ties and saying things about products.  Hey, I hear Sackert.  Who's coming up, boys?  Shut up.  They're looking at us going, we're counting on these guys to save us? 
[02:13:00]  Great.  Hi.  Wow.  Holy Jesus.  Oh, my God.  Oh, boy.  Hi.  A little scared, are you?  Who's going to approach the hot girl?  You should be.  Hi.  Oh, hi.  I'm Mr. Ace.  How are you?  Hello.  How are you?  Hi.  You're the only cheerleader that showed up today?  I am.  The only girl that showed up.  Not much of a budget at BCN, I guess, huh? 
[02:13:30]  Wow.  I like the jersey.  Oh, thank you.  Very cute.  Well, you were thinking, Oste.  Put that on.  I knew there was an ulterior motive.  Yeah, we're going to walk.  Can you do a cheer?  Are you allowed to cheer by yourself?  Why are you twitching?  Are you nervous?  No.  I can do a cheer if you do one first.  I know.  That's not my...  Oh, Kenny.  What if Kenny does one?  Kenny will do a cheer.  He's big and stupid.  Ready?  One bit, two bits, three bits, a peso.  Come on, cheerleader.  Sit on my face-o. 
[02:14:00]  I don't...  You know...  Kenny.  Kenny.  Hey, John Valby.  John Valby's in the parking lot here.  He's drinking his Red Bull.  Yeah.  All right.  Do you cheer or what?  Do you cheer?  Can I do a cheer?  Jim Norton wants to do a cheer.  What do you guys think?  Yeah.  All right.  The tens of people.  Oh, he's got the cheerleader's pom-poms.  I'm sorry.  What was your name?  Michelle.  He's got Michelle's pom-poms.  Give me an R.  Give me an A. 
[02:14:30]  A.  Give me a P.  P.  Give me an E.  P.  What's that spell?  Hooray.  Thanks.  You know, this is not going to endear her.  Are we still on BCN?  We want to know when we can start cursing.  All right.  Where are we walking to?  Hey, are you going to do a cheer or what?  P-A-T-S.  Let's go, Pat.  Yeah.  That dude, I love it. 
[02:15:00]  That was a little too predictable.  That if I was here, this would be great.  That was predictable, huh?  It's hard to follow the race here in the past.  It really is.  Okay.  Who's got another one?  Oh.  O-T-I-E.  Let's go.  O-T-I-E.  Yeah, see, because you're wearing that and I'm worthless.  Yeah.  What about Anthony?  It's hard to do an Anthony one.  A-N-T.  Yeah.  By the time you get to H, you're all exhausted.  Who cares?  At that point, no one cares anymore.  I understand.  All right.  Who wants breakfast at IHOP?  IHOP! 
[02:15:30]  You want a?  Yeah.  What do you want?  A carrot?  No, I'd like to see, um...  I mean, I'm just talking about how you keep such a girlish figure.  Oh, thank you.  I'm a girlish...  I mean, eight.  You're a very tiny girl.  Very lovely.  Yeah.  Do you have heels on?  And you have heels on?  I'm a shorty, definitely.  Yeah.  But that's good.  That's like variety.  Do you have any tall cheerleaders?  There's a...  You do, yeah.  Yeah.  I'm a shorty, so I'm about 5'1", and the tallest is probably 5'9", 5'10".  Is it kind of cheers where you kind of throw each other around, too, or is it... 
[02:16:00]  No, it's like you can't.  Not like that.  No, no stunt.  Because I've seen some of the stunt ones, and you watch the skirts go up, and you look  at the underwear and stuff.  Guys watch those shows sometimes.  A little scary, yeah.  They have a policy against you, like, dating players.  They say a lot of times you're not supposed to date players this whole day.  Yeah, we don't fraternize.  Yeah.  Fraternize is one way to put it.  All right, let's walk.  We got a guy, he wants to show his license plate.  Yes.  O&A fan.  O&A fan.  Very nice.  That's good.  You couldn't get O&A, wow.  It took me two years to get this. 
[02:16:30]  O&A fan, two years, huh?  Didn't we just see you in New York?  No, you haven't?  We've seen you in New York, right?  And, oh, there he is.  Okay.  Broadcasting.  No biggie.  What, what, what?  Ah, this guy's just holding a conversation with me during a broadcast while Opie's doing  an interview, but.  Oh, of course.  Ah, yes.  Good old play.  Co-host.  Dave, Dave, by the way.  That's Dave, by the way.  Who let boy Gary in? 
[02:17:00]  He's still babbling.  That's okay.  You know the ins and outs of radio.  You talk without a mic.  That's great.  If we had more people here, I'd have you removed.  But, it's.  All right, let's go.  Let's go.  How do we get to IHOP, by the way?  We know the way?  I don't know.  Great.  How about we have the cheerleader do something?  Why does this look like a prison escape?  Oh, my God.  She's signing autographs.  Oh.  Looks like BCN doesn't have much of a budget.  They sent one cheerleader. 
[02:17:30]  Oh, state police.  Helping out.  Anyone that wonders what the Opie and Anthony show is like, this is exactly what it's like.  This is it.  Just a bunch of empty, rain-covered seats.  A lot of hopes and dreams.  Oh, look.  A bus with plenty of seats will be open on.  You know, I agree with Whoopi now about people even walking up to her that are our fans.  They are frightening.  All right.  Well, we've got a state trooper here.  I don't know if we're getting arrested or if he's going to be helping us out.  Oh, Kenny.  All right. 
[02:18:00]  Oh, her autograph is on the ground.  Someone just put the G.O.P.'s autograph on the ground.  How you doing, my friend?  Yeah, those guys are all business.  They are all business.  The state police.  They are all business.  You were braving up.  Oh, there goes the sales staff.  Yeah, they're back in.  Wow, now we know how many fillers they got.  Yeah.  They don't have a little stable.  They don't walk into the cubicles.  Now, you know what they're doing now?  What?  Some kind of contingency plan. 
[02:18:30]  All right.  We know we're not going to be able to sell these guys.  There were eight people outside.  Yeah, listen.  They're in panic mode.  They're in panic mode.  That's good.  Let's call Sinbad and see if he can do a radio show.  All right.  Bam.  Videotaping everything.  Is that what you're doing?  Great.  Good.  Not enough worthless video of us.  Yeah, get the kick in the balls, Cam.  Oh, are we still on?  Yeah, we're still on. 
[02:19:00]  When do we get to curse?  I don't know.  Someone's got to give us the signal.  Yeah.  Let us know when we can.  By the way, is everyone going to the O&A traveling virus tomorrow?  That's right.  They all got free tickets.  They all got the free tickets today.  By the way, we're going to be at BCN for another two hours, so if you do show up in the parking  lab, we'll give you tickets to the show.  Yeah.  If you're in the area.  We're just taking a little walk.  We'll be back, though.  I have nothing.  No?  You have nothing for the walk today? 
[02:19:30]  This unbelievable walk is so exciting.  There's so much going on in an industrial park.  You've got to love the t-shirt this guy is wearing, Jimmy.  Yeah, both back cheater.  Makes me very happy.  It's just the location of this.  ABCN really is.  It's a good studio, but the location just stinks.  It's in a weird, like, isolated, like, industrial park.  We lived up here for a bunch of years, and we've been coming back ever since, and I couldn't  tell you where we are.  Yeah, I couldn't tell you where we are. 
[02:20:00]  Yeah, behind some fat guy in a leprechaun head.  There's people down at the old studio.  Oh, great.  Hey, there you go.  Make us feel better about ourselves.  There you go.  Well, that's where I was.  I was down there half an hour knocking on the door.  No one answered.  Great.  I walk up to the back.  They're like, yeah, they're still here.  People still think WBCN is still down there.  Well, it was there for, what, like, 20-some-odd years.  They just moved this less than a year ago.  It's a machine shop now.  Yeah, it's like a printing shop.  Printing presses.  Who knows what it is?  We're blocking traffic. 
[02:20:30]  Is it at Tower Records now or something like that?  No, it still says WBCN.  It still says BCN on the front.  Oh, not too confusing.  Great.  Is that...  Oh, I know where we are.  Isn't the TV stations around here or something?  I have no idea.  Oh, all right.  I remember this area.  I don't know where we are.  I'm scared.  Ann, buy me a new car.  Uh, sure.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Put it on my tab.  I don't want to say it.  We just passed a car bus.  No.  Just carrying that bus rocking back and forth. 
[02:21:00]  Yeah.  Let's go back.  Oh, I cursed again.  Let's go back.  Let's go back.  Ha, ha, you're...  Ha, ha, you're dumb.  You know, there is a total conditioning about walking with the mics and cursing.  Because I could be in the studio and not throwing out, and I've already...  Jimmy let one slip.  I let one slip.  It's just hard to walk and not think we're just unsettling.  Oh, this is good.  20 of our listeners get killed by this truck. 
[02:21:30]  At least we have something to talk about.  Have you seen him take that turn?  There's no way he could kill twice as many people as showed up.  Ah, this is the only way this was supposed to work out.  Philly?  Philly's going to have to beat this.  It's going to be tough.  No.  It's going to be tough for YSP to get something together.  I think they got it wrapped up.  All right.  How far...  We're on a highway.  We're on a highway.  What the hell is this?  We're walking to an IHOP that's on a highway. 
[02:22:00]  Single file, everyone.  Oh, great.  Now the cops are getting involved.  All right, we're going to keep walking.  Single file, everyone.  Single file.  Oh, cool.  They get a little escort.  Oh, my God.  The troopers making everyone cross the street.  Don't cross the street.  What are we doing?  We're staying.  Why are we...  No, because we need that van so they could...  Way to go, Bam, you dummy.  Backed right into a telephone pole. 
[02:22:30]  Why are people standing in the street?  They're just going to get killed.  I don't know.  This is just exciting radio.  This is what we give Boston today.  This is actually very funny, though.  There's a van with a stupid big antenna on the back of it  and a state trooper slowing down traffic  and a bunch of pissed off people late for work  because of the drivel we're putting over the airways right now.  I hope someone is fired over this.  Not us, but because one of those dummies in traffic is fired. 
[02:23:00]  No, we always get other people fired.  First.  First.  Yeah, then we get fired.  And then they get us.  I'm just entertained by what Bam is walking into, walking backwards.  Yeah.  Big telephone poles and signposts.  And he just knocks them down like a wrecking ball.  This is the most exercise this kid's gotten in a decade.  Where's the IHOP?  It's a little further.  Yeah.  It's not too bad.  A little further.  It's in Springfield.  Oh, boy.  A liquor store.  Great.  Oh, well. 
[02:23:30]  They'll do well.  Oh, now everyone's beeping.  They're not happy.  Get out of the way.  Oh, hey.  It's a couple of fans.  Very nice.  Hey, we got some fans today.  All right.  Nice.  Don't show up at IHOP, though.  I'm going to go broke.  Do they have a table for us?  How many do we have here?  We've got a table for four waiting.  Table for four.  Table for four.  There's going to be an empty seat.  You can tell how many people are listening to BCN as they beep as they go by. 
[02:24:00]  Yeah, there are people beeping.  I mean, that's kind of cool.  I guess some people couldn't get out this early on a Friday.  Actually, we don't.  They're working.  We really don't have a bad crowd.  No, it's not that bad.  There's a guy yelling and screaming across the street in his car.  Hey, look at this.  Hey, thank you.  All right.  Boy, there's more traffic that are fans than people walking with us.  A guy driving by with his WOW sticker.  Another one.  There's another one.  They're not necessarily fans.  They think that we're a union protesting. 
[02:24:30]  They're beeping to support us.  In support.  We hate blacks.  No, Jesus.  I know.  All of a sudden, you just hear people pop out of the stores and chant with you.  Boy, I'm real brave, by the way.  Look at the crowd we got.  I knew that was safe, and I didn't even have to turn around.  Yeah.  If it was our listeners, it would be the million-pound march.  See the retarded Jim Carrey over there?  Jesus. 
[02:25:00]  That's pretty good, O.  They want to buy a box of wine.  A box of wine.  That's the eye.  We have to go all the way over there.  Oh, my God.  We got like another half mile.  That's.  Hey, geez.  Where's Dave Wellington?  Are we still on BCN?  Or are they going to take a break?  We're still on?  All right, good.  Let us know when we're not on anymore so we can just kind of coast.  We're giving you our best stuff right now so we can just get dirty, cover it up. 
[02:25:30]  This is the worst.  This is the worst strip mall I've ever seen.  Oh, isn't it horrid?  You have a Staples, a Starbucks, and a party store.  And California.  Oh, California closets are actually all good.  Oh, I just corrected myself.  I used them.  Yes.  In my palatial mansion.  A lot of people driving by with their wow stickers.  That's very cool to see.  Yeah, beeping.  Opie almost walked into a pole.  That was nice.  Did you use California closets?  Yes, I did, Jimmy. 
[02:26:00]  When you opened it, did you see Steve living in it?  E-Rock's taking the exciting pictures.  They'll be up on opiananthony.com.  What are you doing in my closet?  We got other people jumping out of their stores to take a picture.  That's good.  Okay.  We're almost at the IHOP.  We got a nice crowd.  Almost a little Pied Piper thing going on here.  A couple of people joining.  Tell the BCN salespeople I'm not buying them breakfast.  It's nice to walk in the cloud of cigarette smoke from, like, a few people also. 
[02:26:30]  Ugh.  All right.  Who's smoking?  Oh, it's friggin' bam.  We're almost at the IHOP here in Boston.  Sonny with a cigar and you with a cigarette.  Walking upwind.  Get downwind.  Breathe in that crap.  And Jimmy, I can't believe he's talking about how tired he was walking with the camera.  So he lit up his cigarette.  Wonderful. 
[02:27:00]  Our old friend Jimmy, by the way, who was voted most likely to eat us alive.  Yep.  He's actually backing up, just lining up a shot.  Look at the look in his eye.  I don't want to piss him off ever.  He's been following us since he was, like, eight, I think.  How old are you now, Jimmy?  Eighteen.  How long have you been listening to the show?  Eight years.  He started listening to us when he was ten.  Thank God we didn't touch him.  This is what the show does to people.  Look at him.  We do have an influence on the youth of America. 
[02:27:30]  Look at this kid.  What, Jimmy?  Sam's complaining about the walk.  Sam's complaining about the walk.  It's too far.  Light up another cigarette.  All right, we're at Mickey D's.  We're almost at the IHOP.  Boy, are they going to be surprised when everyone enters IHOP and we start running.  I'm sure IHOP won't be surprised.  Half of these people are probably expecting New Year's Eve there. 
[02:28:00]  Are we still on the air?  Apparently so.  We're still on the air?  We're still on the air?  Oh, man, you're nuts.  I would have bailed like, I don't know, ten minutes ago.  I would have thrown on a Smashing Pumpkin song.  All right.  This is a great idea.  Walking a mile.  We walk a block in New York City.  Well, the action could start up. 
[02:28:30]  We are passing a day's in.  What's up, bro?  How are you guys?  More fans.  Gentlemen.  We're picking up fans as we walk, by the way.  Keith the cop, everyone.  Yeah.  We can stay on DCN as long as you want.  Totally up to you.  Oh, really?  All right.  Well, as long as you let us curse.  That ain't going to happen.  Is this old man jerking off in his Dodge?  What is he doing in there?  Someone talk to this guy.  He's reading the want ads.  Look at him.  He doesn't know what's going on. 
[02:29:00]  All right.  Let's go say hi to this guy.  We're surrounding his car.  Hey, tip his car over.  What's going on, bro?  Hey, go away.  Go away.  Oh.  Huh?  We want your comments on.  You want a wow sticker?  Watch out.  He might start his car up and hit the gas.  You have any comments today, sir?  Which way he goes.  Nobody knows.  What is he reading in the news, Opie?  What are you reading in the news today, sir?  Nothing.  Oh, he's ignoring you.  He's not happy. 
[02:29:30]  That's it.  Love you, mister.  He's not happy.  Love you, mister.  Oldies world green rock.  By the way, I think that was Whitey Bulger.  He's hoping the 13-year-old shows up.  Oh, God.  Oh, man.  Ah, cop again.  Where's dateline when you need him?  You were waiting in your car for some time.  Someone talked to this girl.  Another fan of the show.  Hi, it's a girl.  Did you hear that we were walking this way?  I was looking to you, and then I saw you.  And you knew we were walking, so you stopped here to say hi. 
[02:30:00]  Exactly.  Are you working today?  I'm on my way to work right now.  Damn it.  You can't join us for flapjacks?  Wish I could.  Can we see your flapjacks?  Opie.  Opie's always got to put me in the line of fire.  But then again, I remember, she doesn't have headphones on, so you can say whatever the  hell you want.  Oh, well, that was nice of you to stop by.  You got a boyfriend?  No, I don't.  Do you want to pick one of these?  We're not even going to.  You don't have to answer that right now. 
[02:30:30]  You can think about it.  Watch out for that old man over there.  He's doing something.  Yeah, there's an old guy in that car, and he's reading the paper, but I think his hand  was moving.  You want to ask the lady anything, Jimmy?  Are you Irish?  Yeah.  You have freckles.  I like that.  It's very sexy.  Thanks a lot.  So you don't have a fella?  Not really.  Where are you going to work?  You don't have a bra on.  A way.  Jesus, Opie.  Well, someone's got a message.  She says she's on her way to work, and she doesn't even have a bra on. 
[02:31:00]  Yeah, what do you do?  I'm a photographer and a filmmaker.  Oh, you really?  Oh, see?  Pretty artistic.  Um, do you need to make a little extra money?  No, I don't.  All right.  Well, take care.  All right.  Thank you.  Thanks for stopping by.  She's a fan of the show.  There you go.  All right.  We're almost at IHOP, and oh, my God.  Cute little Irish girl.  I'm going to go broke.  Why is that bus parked in front of IHOP?  Are they going to pile out?  Thank you.  One of the listeners just gave me this really cool European Black Sabbath tour backstage.  Oh, who gives a crap?  Good point. 
[02:31:30]  That's good.  I say during 9-11, this is a terrorist hotel.  Oh, wait, wait.  Hold on.  All right.  Now we're at a landmark.  Now we're at a landmark here in Boston.  What do you know about this place?  What do you call it?  The A&E Specialty of Terrorists, and they stayed at the Days Inn on the Charles River  Closetfield Road.  This is it?  Why do you think the rooms are so freaking cheap?  So this is where Mohammed Atta stayed.  Ain't been laid much.  Yeah.  And he's been laid much.  Okay.  Wow.  What room? 
[02:32:00]  Anyone know?  No.  Don't curse.  Don't curse.  They're allowing us to stay at BCN for a while.  There's somebody looking out their window.  Oh, now she just ran away.  Oh, boy.  In between tricks or something.  That must be.  Hill sucks.  Boy, what a great thing to have as your history.  Hill?  Oh, Greg Hill sucks.  Yeah.  Mantown.  Mantown.  That's just sweeping the nation.  Yeah.  So that's pretty interesting.  Wow.  That's kind of scary.  I would have that on the front door.  At least it's got some kind of history to it.  Bring the people in. 
[02:32:30]  I think we can't stay here.  It's an awful hotel.  Jesus.  What a piece of crap hotel that is.  All right.  We're just about at IHOP.  Hey, how you doing?  Does IHOP know we're coming?  Yes.  All right.  IHOP knows we're coming.  All right.  Wow.  We are almost there.  Yeah.  Thank God we had so much entertaining radio for the walk.  I thought it was pretty good.  In an industrial park.  It wasn't bad.  A girl without a bra going to work.  And crazy jacking it guy.  With his red eyes. 
[02:33:00]  You see the red eye?  Get away from me.  Crotchety old man.  Not happy.  No, he didn't.  Watch your step.  She said she'd be here at eight.  I'll give it another hour.  I met her online.  He looked like, he actually looked like Ted Williams, who had his severed head put back on.  All right.  We're at IHOP.  I'm buying breakfast for the first ten people that gets in the door.  Oh, no.  That's right.  Breakfast for the ten finished people. 
[02:33:30]  Two.  That's still, yeah.  There might be people at BCN.  Hello.  Huh?  There might still be people at BCN.  What's the ambulance one?  There you go.  The ambulance.  Bambulance.  Bambulance.  I gave the man UPS.  We got the broadcast van.  Oh, the guy with the wheelchair just rolled in.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Well, we're here. 
[02:34:00]  I think they're, yes, they're raising the boom on the truck so we can broadcast.  By the way, we should tell BCN, the people that are listening right now, this is just us screwing around.  Don't make any impressions today, please.  Yeah, this is like bonus show.  This is what we do.  Excuse me.  Pardon me.  I need to throw this in the trash.  Let's Club Sotacani make the big announcement to IHOP.  He's good at this.  Oh, no.  Oh, boy.  Here he goes.  I want an 0-8-10 as we enter IHOP. 
[02:34:30]  All right.  I'll get it.  Good morning, people of IHOP.  O-N-A!  O-N-A!  O-N-A!  O-N-A!  Please welcome the stars of radio, Opie and Anthony and their entourage.  O-N-A!  O-N-A!  Wow, there's got to be seven people here.  Hi.  Happy breakfast.  Happy breakfast. 
[02:35:00]  Enjoying your breakfast.  Very good.  Thank you, guys.  You need electricity to walk.  Oh, you haven't ordered yet?  What are you going to get?  The pancakes.  Of course, they're wonderful here.  We love it.  I guess they put us in the back here.  Anthony didn't even hear it.  No, I missed it.  He never gives me love, ever.  You're never giving me love.  But I was trying to...  I said, ha-ha, you need electricity to walk.  Jesus.  Okay, that was really bad.  All right, where are we sitting? 
[02:35:30]  Just a big round table.  Let's see.  Wow.  I like this one.  Oh, I don't know the square one.  No, we'll...  A booth.  We can't.  We got to be in the round.  Yeah, we got to be in the round.  A round table.  Yeah.  Jimmy, you got to sit next to me.  Do a round table discussion.  Jimmy, save a seat for Jimmy.  Right there.  Oh, my God.  You rock.  How are we going to eat?  You can let her hand go.  They're not going to attack her.  All right.  Take a seat.  Hello, hello, hello. 
[02:36:00]  All right.  We have sat down at IHOP.  Ah.  And we're buying breakfast for this crew.  What?  You're not the server?  You're not the server?  You don't want any part of that, right?  No.  No, you work for BCN, right?  Yeah.  She works for BCN.  Yeah.  She's just helping us out.  She's handing out menus.  Let's see.  I need coffee.  Bill needs coffee.  Try the trout dog.  Hey, can we take a break, and then we'll come back from IHOP.  Then BCN can figure out what they want to do.  Okay.  Why don't we do that? 
[02:36:30]  Are you guys going to have...  I don't know.  I wanted to get these guys saying something.  Well, there's more people than there were when we left.  What happened?  I'm seeing dollar signs flying out of my wallet.  Cha-ching.  You volunteered, my friend.  I'm an ass.  If you're wearing a suit, I'm not buying you breakfast.  Thank you, obviously.  All right, everybody.  What we're going to do...  Kenny, give us the big plug and take us to break.  So BCN can play some commercials.  Also, we're going to do a dine and dash, everybody.  So keep it on the QT.  We're all skipping out on the check. 
[02:37:00]  All right, Kenny, go.  All right, we're broadcasting live.  WBCN and XM Satellite Radio.  We're at IHOP.  We're going to eat breakfast.  Hey, the big plug for tomorrow's show.  It's the big build-up.  Okay.  And tomorrow, everybody be at Worcester at the DCU Center for the O&A Traveling Virus Show.  Be there or be square. 
[02:37:30]  We'll see you later.  Opie and Anthony, live from Boston, where everything is taken in moderation.  I think we're back on the radio.  Wow.  The crowd turned out to be very, very good, by the way. 
[02:38:00]  It started out a little lame, but by the time we got to IHOP, very, very nice turnout.  A lot more people came on board.  It was like the Pied Piper.  Yeah.  Yeah, people just came off the street, pulled their cars over, parked, joined, and hanging  out in IHOP.  They've given us pretty much a run of the joint.  And now I'm paying for breakfast.  Yeah.  This is going to be a biggie.  Yeah, this is going to be a biggie.  That's okay, though.  I think we're still on WBCN.  I think what's going to happen, Adam Twill is going to take over for a while, and then  he can check in with us while we're eating and all that. 
[02:38:30]  Oh, that's nice.  And we'll stay on XM, obviously.  That could keep things a little safer.  We have to know exactly when we're on and off, though.  You want to speak to the clowns, the dunking clowns?  You're the guy?  Oh, that's you.  Holy crap.  This guy is a, you're a celebrity.  Don't, keep us on BCN for a little while.  You were the one at Lollapalooza, right?  UsFest.  It's Drown the Clown.  Here, all right.  Drown the Clown.  The bozo boys.  So now...  What are you looking at, you crackhead? 
[02:39:00]  What are you trying to do, show your girlfriend something else you can't do?  Hey, buddy, I feel sorry for your girlfriend.  You can't even get me wet.  This guy, Bill Burr, found you at UsFest, and we said we have to have this guy for our  O&A traveling virus, so he's going to be working in the dunking booth, obviously.  Do you bring around security?  No, we don't need security.  You're not one of those guys, because there's a lot of guys like him, and they have their 
[02:39:30]  own security, because some of these guys get really pissed off at the insults.  They want to kill you.  We're all right.  30 years I'm playing clown.  No incidents.  Everybody has a good time.  It's good entertainment.  It's great.  And join Opie and Anthony at the Virus Tour.  We're going to have a great time.  Come on out and have some fun.  Can we have it like a...  They're loving it.  Hey, can you make fun of our listeners?  Who wants to make fun of this... 
[02:40:00]  Look at that beautiful blonde over there.  Hey, sweetheart, you got such beautiful blonde hair.  Why'd you dye the roots black?  And look at her boyfriend over there.  Looks like Forrest Gump.  Run, Forrest, run.  Look at this guy.  Oh, my gosh.  You got more rolls than a bakery.  You got more chins than a Chinese phone book.  What are you laughing at over there, buckwheat?  Smile so I can see you.  You got to hit the red. 
[02:40:30]  You got knucklehead.  All right, very nice.  Drown the Clown.  That'd be on a traveling virus.  Who wants a hat?  There you go.  And here's another hat.  Oh, you got a hat?  Pass them out to the guy.  Pass them out to these guys.  These are the guys you want wearing your hat.  Kenny, anybody else here today?  I mean, we got all the big celebrities for our Boston broadcast.  Sonny Farrelly.  Sonny, you haven't said anything yet. 
[02:41:00]  You're just taking it all in?  I hope you bring the tea material.  That's okay?  He's just babbling.  All right.  Yeah, Sonny's just babbling.  Are they going to serve breakfast, Kenny?  What's the deal here?  Yeah, we're trying to get the minorities to move a little faster.  Did everybody or most people get a menu?  Sonny got a menu and just said yes and handed it back.  All right. 
[02:41:30]  I think we're going to give it back to Adam 12 for a while on BCN.  He'll check in with us to see how it goes here at IHOP as we buy breakfast for our listeners.  And we'll continue on XM.  So, Adam, you can take it any time you want there.  What we're going to do...  All right, I hope...  We're going to eat for a little while.  And then we're going to bail.  These guys will get their food and then join us back at the parking lot, okay?  Yeah, everybody back to the base camp.  Because we've got a bus outside that will bring the show back to BCN so we can continue broadcasting for XM. 
[02:42:00]  And we've got to get some dirty songs out of John Valby before we get out of here today.  Yeah, what the fuck?  Whoa.  Hope we're on XM only.  I was just throwing a test word out there to see if we were still on BCN.  If I see people running and panicking, then there's a problem.  How is it?  We all right?  Okay, great.  We have a go for the F word.  Jimmy, good.  Oh, Jimmy's got the little clown hat shirt on.  The guy in the hat right here. 
[02:42:30]  Yeah.  Chuck Mangione.  A clockwork awful.  A clockwork lemon.  All right.  Well, where's our coffee?  Where's our food?  We just ordered.  Now we just start whining.  Don't say anything bad until we get our food.  They spit in all their food.  That's a good point.  That's a good point.  Jimmy's...  Oh, there it is.  Jimmy's now talking with an attractive lady. 
[02:43:00]  I was talking with the cheerleader, and I think I'm doing good.  I'm like, so you can eat?  And she looks at her wife and goes, nope, I'm out in 15 minutes.  You really said that?  No, she's not being mean.  She's just, you know, she's only here for a little while.  Well, they paid her for an hour.  I don't blame her.  That's normally what I do.  So, can we just make it like it normally is for me, like when you leave?  Can you just go, hey, thanks a lot, and we'll avoid eye contact?  If it's going to be like it normally is with you, you have to hand her cash, Jimmy. 
[02:43:30]  I know.  All right.  Anybody else?  Coffee?  No, thanks, Dolphin.  Keep me up all day.  Oh, cherish that thought.  Jimmy, sit over here so we can share mics.  We're sharing.  Yeah.  I want to share with Jimmy.  You could share with Jimmy.  Jimmy, but then he won't be sitting next to the cute cheerleader.  Yeah.  I think that's what he wants more than he gives a crap about what's going out over the air.  Boy, how obvious is it that we have to get back to home base?  What?  I think we're having a lot of fun here.  We're like the guys outside the space shuttle in space, like, ah, ah, could you bring us back inside, please? 
[02:44:00]  We checked.  The tiles are all fine.  We're coming home.  Right.  Is there any boysenberry syrup?  I don't know.  Which one's the boysenberry?  Kenny, have that checked out.  I haven't had it since I was a kid.  No.  See, that's got me a little flustered.  Yeah.  Just grab them with a napkin.  Very sticky.  Very little photo op.  Ew.  Very sticky.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, boy. 
[02:44:30]  Kenny's got to put...  So do Kenny in his reading glasses, everyone.  That's always a treat.  That's boysenberry.  What is a boysenberry?  Kenny, what's the deal here at IHOP?  Because we have to do a radio show.  You know, my girlfriend used to work at the International House of Pancakes, and when  she got done with work, I'd hop on her ass.  That would be good if the places were...  Oh, hey!  I'd hop.  Too bad she didn't work at the Palm, because you're a jerk-off.  Hello. 
[02:45:00]  Hi.  Anthony, are you ordering?  I thought I ordered already.  Oh.  Yeah.  Oh, I don't want anything.  Wait, come over here.  I had the French toast.  Come here, toast.  Two people ordered, right?  Two people ordered.  Two hundreds ago.  Yeah, you've got to take orders for everybody.  You're going to get a nice tip.  Huh?  Yeah.  This one we take from this table first.  Yeah, we've been...  Oh, oh.  I'll have...  I got the big orange juice.  I said French toast.  I already told someone. 
[02:45:30]  You said this table first, and then basically just in order of ethnicity.  Yeah.  By the way, Kenny...  Kenny announced to everyone what's going to happen.  We're going to leave soon to continue broadcasting, and then these guys can eat, and then tell  them to join us back in the parking lot for more festivities, okay?  All right.  All right, listen up.  We're going to all eat breakfast, all right?  And then the stars of the show are going to exit earlier, and then when you're done eating,  come back to the parking lot of BCN, and we'll continue the merriment. 
[02:46:00]  Because I don't want them to think we're running out on them.  No, no.  We got tickets.  Did these people get their tickets yet?  No.  No, nobody got tickets.  Oh.  That's why they're still hanging out.  Yeah.  See, we're smart.  I was feeling good about myself.  We're smart.  No, no.  Everything's going good, though.  Yeah?  Yeah, yeah.  So when we get back to the parking lot, they get their tickets?  Yeah, yeah.  That ensures them to come back.  Dave Wellington says do it here. 
[02:46:30]  Yeah, start handing out the tickets, because maybe some of these people have to go to work  or something.  Well, they don't have to go to work.  Look at them.  Nothing?  Yeah.  Huh?  All right.  So how about Keith and Chris Rucker from BCN?  We'll go around the room and distribute the tickets equally.  All right.  And if you want free breakfast, stick around.  Yeah.  Did you order anything to eat, Opie?  No, I ate the steak and eggs from the palm. 
[02:47:00]  Oh, that's right.  You kind of gorged out the other place.  I was eating the whole show.  All right, everybody.  Be cool.  This is a robbery.  Let me up, you fucking...  Less of a tragic scene than this fucking one is.  We better order soon, though, because half of the...  ...gigs to get to.  What should we do?  Should we have, like, Derek play a little bit?  Why?  Why?  Are you guys going to eat? 
[02:47:30]  This is what XM's all about.  Yeah.  It's kind of, you know, if we're on the road...  I'm going to love reading the message, boys.  It's like, dude, what the fuck?  We listen to what we eat?  Yeah.  That's what you're going to fucking listen to.  Yeah.  That's what you get today.  Eat it.  We're big stars.  Read the papers today.  We do whatever we want to do.  We don't have to do anything today.  We got a lot of press.  Remember when we first went on XM?  We said...  Enjoy it.  Yeah.  We said there's going to be...  Thanks, bro.  We're going to have the opportunity to do things that we can't do on regular radio. 
[02:48:00]  You're going to be able to listen in, like, voyeuristically to maybe us eating at an IHOP.  Not the most exciting thing, but...  But very voyeuristic.  But you get shit like that.  And if you're lucky, Jimmy will take a dump live on the air today.  Wow.  Is anything going on in there yet?  Oh, yeah.  I've been drinking half and half.  Whenever I drink half and half, I cut a lot of gassers.  Because she's...  I see she be brought in on what's going on.  You really don't have to hang with us anymore.  We get it. 
[02:48:30]  We know you don't want to.  It's cool.  It's fun to be out.  It's fun.  Yeah, it looks it.  So as soon as we get out of here, I'm probably going to take a dump that, like...  What?  Steve, what do we got?  Well, whenever you want to wrap up, we'll...  We got about 10 to 14 minutes of stuff that Derek's got set aside.  And the bus will bring us back to BCN.  And we'll continue on with XM there.  All right.  Very good.  We definitely want to get back to more John Valby songs in.  More John Valby stuff.  Yes.  Or can we do that from here?  Oh, boy.  We won't be able to hear it. 
[02:49:00]  Huh?  Why not?  I want to hear it.  We'll be able to hear it.  The two people with headphones.  Oh, I know.  But I'm just saying for XM.  Have John Valby play a song.  Is that possible?  That could be pretty cool.  We could, like, interview John Valby.  He's over there.  We're over here.  We're eating.  He's playing.  He's cursing.  We're burping.  And Jimmy's a little bit angry because he can't hear it.  And Jimmy's dumping.  Maybe we could share headphones.  Get your head right next to mine.  Oh, I would like that. 
[02:49:30]  A little snuggle.  You doing anything exciting yesterday, Jimmy?  Went to the gym.  Yeah.  Watch Lucky Louie with Kenny in the gym.  I went back.  Did Kenny just comment on, like, look how good you are?  No, because, you know, I hate watching myself.  There's just two other guys in the gym.  It was really creepy.  Yeah.  Really homoerotic.  Four men just sweating.  Pump one more out.  Come on.  But just to watch his...  But he's jerking you off back in the room when he says that. 
[02:50:00]  No, it was all right.  I'm just really tired.  As soon as this is done, you guys have a sales meeting.  I have a bed to put my fat face into.  Oh, great.  I forgot about that.  That's right.  How long is that going to be?  I need an answer immediately.  Another hour.  Is it going to be an hour?  I think so, yeah.  I hear there's like 37 of them or something.  I don't know.  It's going to be a ridiculous amount of, like, sales people, and we've got to sit there  and listen to it.  I might go back on BCN tonight. 
[02:50:30]  Really?  And do what?  Just play music.  Spin a little?  Spin some songs?  Become a rock jock again?  And screw around a little bit.  I was going to invite you, but I knew you'd say no.  Fuck that.  It's early in the month.  New movies at the hotel.  We could go on and just play the songs we like.  You can go on and play the songs you like.  I might tune in.  All right.  Well, we don't even have a paper in front of us.  I want to go on.  Jimmy, you want to go on?  No.  My health doesn't allow it. 
[02:51:00]  Poor, poor girl.  You would think the staff would give us some newspapers so maybe we can make some shit  up.  We don't even have a newspaper in front of us to make it sound like we're actually trying  to do a radio show.  She's sitting here like, why me?  Jimmy.  Why me?  How many cheerleaders are there?  23.  23.  23.  23.  23 total, yeah.  So there was a one in 23 shot that you would be the one that had to do this drivel.  I'm so lucky.  I want to apologize to you. 
[02:51:30]  I'm so lucky.  Thank you for having me.  You are a trooper, man.  What a diplomat.  She's actually very nice.  She's a nice girl.  Very nice.  Very cute.  We're glad she was here.  Yeah.  And, you know, I wouldn't want to be here if I was her, by all these fucking unattractive  guys.  Is this the most amount of unattractive people you've ever had to hang out with?  No way.  I see some hotties in the crowd.  You do?  Yeah.  Wow.  Trying to figure out who they could possibly be.  Just squint a little.  Just squint a little, she says. 
[02:52:00]  Okay.  She's got a sense of humor.  Hey, John.  Hey.  John Balby back in the studio.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hey, is this sounding like anything?  This is sounding nuts.  Yeah.  Well, now we can play some dirty songs.  Oh, my God.  That's so loud.  Because we're only on XM right now, so you can let the curses fly, okay?  We're not on BCN, right?  All right.  We're only on XM, John.  What's the big gig tonight and tomorrow?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Faneuil Hall tonight at 1030 and Hooky Lau and Chickapie tomorrow night. 
[02:52:30]  Very nice.  You guys are in Worcester, though.  So, you know, you got to, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  How about, give me another shot of rotgut.  The bitch's face looks like a horse butt.  She's coming on to me about as long as I can see.  My hand is looking much better.  I don't care how much money I got to spend.  Got to get this girl out of focus.  Someone drive me home. 
[02:53:00]  I'd rather be alone.  My hand is looking much better.  Well, it's looking much better.  So, I don't want to let her get close to my gland.  Listen, lady, no offense, but in the morning I don't have to talk to my hand.  When I'm done, yeah, give me another shot of turpentine.  Ain't got time for no cheap wine.  Bourbon, rum, and scotch.  Pour it on my crotch. 
[02:53:30]  If it's drunk, maybe it'll let her.  If it's drunk, maybe it'll let her.  Cha-cha-cha.  Cha-cha-cha.  John Valby, yes.  Very good.  Oh, yeah.  Most of the people here at IHOP can't hear you, John.  That's why no applause, okay?  Oh, I don't hear you.  All right.  But they're listening to you out there on XM.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  XM World.  Whoa.  Jimmy, put that away.  John, are you getting drunk in the studio?  I'm starting to get a buzz. 
[02:54:00]  You found the beer?  Good.  I think there was a bottle of vodka or something by where I was sitting.  I brought a little flask of tequila myself.  Oh, tequila.  I know.  He's not lying.  Tequila in the morning.  Oh, my God.  What a way to go.  Hey, how's Ron, by the way?  Ron's doing excellent, man.  He's a happy guy.  Ron's John Valby's silent partner for many, many years.  Yeah.  He's the genius behind the whole thing.  Yeah, most people don't realize that John Valby's gay.  Hey!  He's had a very good partnership for many, many years. 
[02:54:30]  Now, you met Ron, what, like 30 years ago or something like that?  Yeah, 30 years ago.  We played in different rock bands, and we'd be on the same show, and then I started a  solo act, and he came and saw me, and then the next week he came and gave me a song, and  then he would do that every week for, you know, 26, 27 weeks.  He showed up one time, and I was doing all of his stuff, and he goes, hey, hey, what's  going on here?  And we ended up, I begged him to go on the road for four years, and he finally did.  Ha ha ha ha ha!  Ha ha! 
[02:55:00]  Hello?  Yeah, that's a good success story.  Yeah, that was a stupid success story.  You might have heard crickets during that.  Yeah.  That was just wonderful.  Uh, well, at least I didn't have any boysenberry fucking jelly.  Ha ha ha ha!  See?  Yeah, at least we're not talking about syrup.  Yeah, he could dish it out.  John, you got another one in you?  Uh, yeah, let me see.  You were-  Hey, what's the dirtiest song you got?  I fucked a dead whore by the roadside. 
[02:55:30]  Ha ha ha ha!  I knew goddamn well she was dead.  Ha ha ha!  The skin on her belly was yellow.  Ha ha ha!  There wasn't a hair on her head.  While thinking about my dilemma, I realized my terrible sin.  Ha ha ha!  So I placed my lips on her pussy, and sucked out the load I shot.  Bring back, bring back, oh, bring back my semen to me, to me. 
[02:56:00]  Bring back, bring back, oh, bring back my semen to me.  Ha ha ha!  All right, that could be one of the dirtiest songs ever.  Yeah, yeah.  That's the worst, huh?  Yeah, I think that's pretty low.  And one of my favorites now.  That's really good.  You have anything that's topical.  Topical.  Oh, man, you're hurting me now. 
[02:56:30]  It's too early in the morning.  Yeah, the Katrina one, that was kind of topical still.  Yeah.  You did some push bashing.  What else?  Yeah, I don't know.  It's too early in the morning.  Yeah, he told you, Opie.  All right, too early in the morning.  For promoting yourself, John.  Well, yeah, that's why I'm where I am.  All right.  I could do Christmas.  Ah, fuck that.  Ah.  All right, John Balby, everyone.  John, we'll see you back at the studio. 
[02:57:00]  Yeah, don't go anywhere.  Okay.  We'll be back.  Just have to wait.  I don't know what the hell there.  Is John actually on the air right now?  No, he's waiting, right?  Yeah.  Okay, because the clown had a song.  He's a real good one.  Oh, wow.  He's got a Christmas song.  You guys want to hear a Christmas song?  Oh, boy.  Oh, no.  Oh, no, it's going to be a gem.  All right, hold on.  We're going to give you a mic.  This is the Drown the Clown. 
[02:57:30]  Yeah, I had a look at your name.  What a dope I am.  And you'll be at the ONA Traveling Virus tomorrow night at the DCU Center in Worcester.  And it's Drown the Clown.  Yeah.  Hopefully.  All right, guys out there, this is my version of Towards the Night Before Christmas and  All Through the House.  All right?  This is my version, the clown version.  Towards the night before Christmas and all through the house, not a creature was stuttering,  not even the mouse.  The stockings were hung with chimney with care.  Hope that's St. Nicholas who will be there.  No, wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  That's the wrong version. 
[02:58:00]  Towards the night before Christmas and all through the house, everybody was stoned, even  the mouse.  I in the whore house, my mom in jail.  I just settled down for a piece of tail.  Without on the roof, I heard such a clatter.  I rose from my chick to see what was the matter.  I flew off the window, flew off the stash, tripped over the broomstick and fell on my ass.  And what should my bloodshot eyes should appear?  But a rusted old sleigh and ate horny reindeer.  It was a little old driver holding on to his prick. 
[02:58:30]  I knew in a moment it must be St. Dick.  He came down the chimney like a bat in a hell.  I knew in a moment the old bastard had fell.  He filled the stockings with wine and beer and a big rubber dick for the family queer.  And as he explained as he drove out of sight, fuck is all.  I had a hell of a night.  Imagine if we never heard that.  John Bell, he's laughing. 
[02:59:00]  John's just drinking tequila back at BCA.  I actually got more laughs out of the original version.  John.  John.  You all right, John?  Yeah.  How about pimp, slut, huge hooters everybody grabs?  Grandma's good eating.  Her cooter's full of crabs.  Tit, lick, twat, slick, sperm-covered bun.  Don't walk through the big dig.  Run, fucker, run. 
[02:59:30]  That's good.  And very topical.  Yeah.  I knew there was one in there somewhere.  All right.  Come on.  I got to go home.  I got to go to sleep, man.  I'm an old fart.  We'll be back there very shortly.  But I thought we were having fun, John.  We are having fun, but I need to have fun tonight, too.  All right.  The big plug, John.  We'll let you go.  Big plug.  Daniel Hall.  Come on down.  Go through the big dig.  Look at all the little shit on the side in the water and all that.  And then go see O&A tomorrow in Worcester. 
[03:00:00]  Oh, yeah.  I was supposed to say, call for tickets.  617-248-9700.  Like, they're going to fucking write that fucker down.  Hey, you're at the Comedy Connection tonight?  Yeah, that's it.  Comedy Connection.  Daniel Hall.  I'm going, John.  When are the shows?  1030.  Just one show.  All right.  Can you save me a couple seats?  Absolutely.  All right.  I'll be there tonight.  Thank you, John.  Hey, thank you.  John Balby, everyone.  All right.  Very, very good.  All right, John. 
[03:00:30]  You know, there's one other thing we've got to do, and then I think we should hit the road.  I think you're going to have to take your breakfast to go, Ant.  Is that all right?  Yeah.  Give me a doggy bag, as they call it.  And you guys get breakfast.  We'll pay for it.  And then, if you want, you can join us back at BCN.  Do you guys want to see Kenny skip?  Yeah!  Oh, this is a treat.  Seeing a big retard skip.  All right, hold on, hold on.  Kenny, you've got to start from over there.  This is a photo op, everybody.  You've got to start from that back wall.  Everyone clear out.  Give him some room.  He looks like a giant Seinfeld. 
[03:01:00]  That's the code word for Jew.  All right, here goes Kenny skipping.  This is just terrific for everybody.  Move out of the way.  Here comes Kenny.  He's coming through.  Oh, he's not stopping.  6-6, skipping all the way to the front door.  All the way.  Passing some black family.  Wow, he went all the way on the other side of the IHOP.  Wow, he went all the way around.  You guys, when he comes back, give him some love. 
[03:01:30]  Here he is.  Club side of Kenny.  Skipping around the IHOP.  Very nice.  A big Seinfeld.  That is really funny.  A giant Seinfeld.  I smell bit.  I haven't said that in a while.  Wow, he's...  I smell bit.  And he returns like a boomerang.  All right.  A big retarded boomerang.  All right, Kenny, we should leave.  We've got to get back to BCN.  You guys enjoy breakfast.  We'll see you in the parking lot, okay?  Bring back my French toast.  Everyone get their tickets.  Don't worry.  You'll get a goddamn ticket.  How are we handling the bill? 
[03:02:00]  I don't know.  We're leaving.  We're dining and dashing.  Did you get something?  Dave, how are we handling the bill?  I have a butt back.  How are we handling the bill for this?  You want to come back and pay?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He'll come back with my credit card.  Kenny will come back.  I promise.  Just work it out with the IHOP staff.  We'll be back.  Kenny will come back with the credit card.  Thanks, guys.  Oh, yes.  Yeah, return when you're done because we'll be over there. 
[03:02:30]  Over there now.  We're leaving IHOP to continue broadcasting from the WBCN studios.  More people here.  Wow, this place is packing out for breakfast, I guess.  I don't know what they're here for.  Wow.  Looks like breakfast, I guess.  You know something?  Huh?  I should have gotten my food.  What the hell was that about?  No, I understand, but you're going to come back?  Yeah, yeah.  And plus, you got a big Palm Luncheon.  Oh, that's right. 
[03:03:00]  All right.  There's something you don't see every day in Boston.  Hey, man, how are you?  Certainly, sir.  All right, we're going to take a break.  Derek's back in New York.  Derek's going to do a little filler crap as we drive back to BCN.  We'll see you in just a bit.  It's Opie and Anthony live from Boston.  Come see Opie and Anthony live in Boston and witness E-Rock.  The only thing that falls apart worse than the Big Dig. 
[03:03:30]  I'll see you in just a bit.  I'll see you in just a bit.  I'll see you in just a bit.  Shake it in.  That's the real deal. That's the shit. 
[03:04:00]  That's the real deal. 
[03:04:30]  That's the real deal.  That's the real deal.  That's the real deal.  That's the real deal.  That's the real deal.  That's the real deal.  That's the real deal. 
[03:05:00]  That's the real deal.  That's the real deal.  That's the real deal.  That's the real deal.  That's the real deal.  That's the real deal.  That's the real deal.  That's the real deal.  That's the real deal.  That's the real deal.  That's the real deal.  That's the real deal. 
[03:05:30]  That's the real deal.  That's the real deal.  We'll be right back. 
[03:06:00]  We'll be right back. 
[03:06:30]  We'll be right back. 
[03:07:00]  We'll be right back. 
[03:07:30]  We'll be right back. 
[03:08:00]  We're going to dumb this thing down to the point that we're going to be number one with Down Syndrome children.  We'll be right back. 
[03:08:30]  What the hell do you think we're doing here?  Talking?  Talking for our health?  Are we also BCN?  No, we're just XM.  All right.  Go fuck yourself.  We got to talk about the clown. 
[03:09:00]  Oh, my dear, sweet Jesus.  Did you talk about the strip bus?  Screw the strip bus right now.  All right.  Got to talk about the clown.  All right.  Set it up.  Before he gets to a radio.  If he gets to one, it'll probably be a 1940 where his material is.  Look at you.  You're as fat as a Zeppelin.  He made Rich Voss sound like Bill Hicks.  Oh, my God. 
[03:09:30]  Look at this menu.  What is this?  The Emancipation Proclamation?  The old-ass references.  More chins than a Chinese phone.  Does he?  And this is the beauty.  He's a Romero called.  He wants his hat back.  He looks at a black guy and goes,  smile so I can see you,  even though you're in a sea of white people  and it's the middle of the afternoon. 
[03:10:00]  The guy was at Ausfest, I guess, last year.  And Bill Burr had pointed out how funny it was  because he was just ragging on people.  And when we decided to do this whole virus tour,  we thought it would be funny to have a dunk tank  and get the clown guy in.  And it'll be funny, believe me.  I'm going to want to throw a baseball at his head.  Yeah.  And at his writing hand.  Ha!  It was the night before Christmas. 
[03:10:30]  Ha!  Ha!  I actually like the original version better.  Good throw, catfish hunter.  Ha!  The guy could not come up with a reference  from the past 25 years, I think,  was the closest thing.  Oh, my God.  Hey, how about that water gate?  Run, Forrest, run.  Ha!  Ugh.  Yeah, when he came out with more chins  than a Chinese phone book.  Wow.  I knew it was over, Johnny.  When I heard blonde hair dyed black at the roots,  I'm like, all right, you've got to give him one pass. 
[03:11:00]  He was nervous.  It was his first pitch.  He threw it in the dirt.  Yeah.  And boy, the next one went right over the batter's head  and into the fence.  And then it went right to more rolls than a bakery.  Oh, and then he segwayed nicely.  Which is a wild pitch.  Someone scores.  And then he sees the black guy,  smile so I can see you.  Which is you're going to throw the ball  and it falls behind you.  It rolls behind you.  And you turn, can't see it.  Everyone scores.  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha! 
[03:11:30]  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  This is the worst hack joke.  Look at you two guys, you look like bosom buddies.  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Oh my god.  Ha!  Please, dunk the shit out of him tomorrow.  That's what I want to see.  Oh, look at that, we just beat the rain. 
[03:12:00]  Really?  Wow, it is pouring out.  It's like a monsoon.  Can we talk about the, uh, uh, the bust with the stripper pull?  Yeah.  That was amazing.  What do they do with that thing?  I can only imagine.  Um, girl dance and guys jerk off, that's why there's no, the seats are all plastic.  The seats were sticky.  How is that legal?  Um, let me think.  I don't know.  It was a bust that they souped up, kind of made it look like the inside of one of those  really big, uh, limos.  Yeah.  Party limos, the really just ridiculous ones.  Don't, but don't, but don't, you're, you're, you're, you're getting this image that it's  like, uh, with the lights and like a limo. 
[03:12:30]  This was like just a bus that they put bench seats around the edges and in the middle is  a wooden floor.  Uh, there's carpeting everywhere else, but in the middle is a wooden floor, uh, about  four foot by four foot square with a brass stripper pole in the middle.  So I guess a bunch of guys maybe for a bachelor party, a night out, get together, rent this  bus, get a stripper, a couple of strippers and they do their act in the bus as, uh, they're 
[03:13:00]  driving around.  Maybe probably when they go to a football game, cause it smells a little like beer.  Like it's not like a bar.  Yeah.  Like when you walk into a bar.  So, uh, I guess that's, what's going on.  I took a turn on the stripper pole.  Yeah.  Jimmy, uh, took a turn, uh, on the back seat.  I'm winning everybody.  Jimmy, Jimmy decided he wanted to look out the back window of the bus and pulled his pants  down to his knees before he did it.  No, I didn't.  I was running and my trousers fell down.  Oh, your trousers fell?  My trousers fell.  Because all I saw was you looking out the back window and a big brown eye winking at 
[03:13:30]  me.  Yeah.  Why did it take 10 minutes to get your trousers back up?  Because I was scared.  You enjoyed the breeze?  Yes.  I was blowing the sweat dry on my crack.  Where's my French toast?  I want my God damn, I ordered the grain nut pancakes.  How long ago?  Two hours.  Jesus.  By the way, they're not getting my credit card.  No, Kenny's putting the bill.  No, you think we didn't know this was going to go right to BCN?  Of course.  I go, Dave, how are we paying for this?  And he went, I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna. 
[03:14:00]  I thought you guys were paying for it.  Who's paying for it?  Ed Norton.  I'm gonna, I'm gonna.  Hey, um, good news.  We're actually going to do a little more radio.  Little more.  How about a little?  We had a good show today.  I know.  I don't appreciate that, Jimmy.  We had a good show today.  Being reprimanded.  We had a good show today.  I'm not saying we didn't.  Uh, brother Joe.  I think so.  Yes.  Was on the WB11 this morning in New York City.  Yeah.  A couple of days ago, Joe called up and said that they were having a vote on the WB in New 
[03:14:30]  York, uh, for tribute bands, uh, they were to play and you go to the website of WB vote.  And I guess having a nationally syndicated radio show that's also on satellite plugging  one of the bands may have put them over the top.  That is so against all the rules.  Some people were sending the rules now that it's over and he already did it.  So some people sent the rules to me and it said that you're not supposed to do anything  to slant the voting. 
[03:15:00]  It's supposed to be completely fair and balanced and everything.  Meanwhile, national radio program gets behind one band.  So of course, Joe won, uh, to you, the band.  I would like to see how many votes the second place band got.  Oh, probably like 50.  And then, uh, Joe got like thousands, thousands upon thousands.  And, um, they played, they played today.  I didn't get to see it or hear it because we are in Boston.  I guess Dirk has it back in New York.  Dirk has it.  Dirk has it back in New York. 
[03:15:30]  So, uh.  What is it labeled?  J-O-W.  Joe.  That unspelling idiot.  Oh, they don't have it yet.  Oh, they don't have it yet.  Oh, they don't have it.  We got to fill.  We'll get it there.  There's no rush.  But we were supposed to have.  Oh, my French toast.  Where's my fork?  You got French toast?  Fill open.  I did.  Put them there.  I'm eating.  Oh.  Where's the syrup?  I like mine with syrup. 
[03:16:00]  Wait, I got the grain nuts.  Which ones are which?  I don't know.  You get nothing.  Oh, do you have apples on yours?  That looks delicious.  Yeah.  Let me have it.  Gimme.  I'm just going to do this and pick it up with my fingers.  Oh.  Because I washed my hands.  Where's my napkin and fork?  After I had my cock in it.  I want to eat with my napkin and fork now.  Oh.  Don't touch my napkin and fork, Keith.  Thank you.  Thank you.  What did Opie get?  Uh, who wants my pancakes? 
[03:16:30]  I'm having my pancakes.  I'm allergic to apples.  I like apples.  Well, then have mine.  Still can have mine.  He's got his napkin shoved down his shirt like it's supper time.  When I was a boy, my father would do something and say, how do you like them apples?  And I would say, I don't care for apples.  It feels like their penis in my backside.  I'm going to do what Jimmy did.  Woo.  I'm going to tuck.  Get a picture of these guys with their, with their napkins tucked nice.  I don't want my shirt getting. 
[03:17:00]  I'm enjoying my pancakes.  Hey.  I am so scared of syrup.  Where's, uh.  Oh, there we go.  We're going to, we're going to attempt to talk to brother Joe.  Oh, we're on the phone?  Yeah.  I don't know how to do this though.  Uh oh.  Just pick it up.  Do I do this?  No, no, no.  Hey Joe, what's going on today?  Ah.  Yeah.  Hey Joe, how's it going today?  Uhura.  You got me.  Ah.  Brother Joe.  I'm on the phone.  I'm on the phone.  What's going on guys?  What's up?  Your volume. 
[03:17:30]  I think I hear them.  Your volume's a little low, but.  Yeah.  So is yours.  Alright.  I'm in the truck man.  We're heading back to Fort Jefferson.  We just did the WB thing.  A couple of songs.  How'd it go?  It went killer man.  It was really good.  These things would be definitely good for demos, to pop up to agencies and stuff.  And the new drummer worked out great.  Everything looked really good.  You know, pro taping, you know.  It was really good man.  Great times.  Yeah.  And so, did anyone question why you got so many votes? 
[03:18:00]  Yes, actually it was blatant.  It was way out front.  Everyone, Emily Francis, who did the interview, said, so you know, one of you guys is related  to Anthony and blah, blah, blah.  And the whole thing was blown wide open.  We didn't care.  I don't, you know, I wasn't deluding myself into believing we wanted on our own merits,  but it turns out we were the most popular band in New York, so fuck everyone else.  You know what?  A win's a win.  That's right.  A little nepotism never hurts. 
[03:18:30]  We don't care.  We use steroids.  A win's a win.  That's what it is.  We use steroids.  Huh?  I thank everybody on Wackbag and we did the old WB shout out to ONA.  Oh, the shout out.  That's how good that is.  But it was good man.  We had a lot of fun doing it.  It looked great.  Sounded great.  And we're taking it up to Foxwoods tonight.  We're going to get up.  Foxwoods tonight?  Yeah.  Very good.  See ya buddy.  I'm not saying see ya. 
[03:19:00]  I think I have.  No, no.  They're telling us you gotta go.  Yeah, brother Joe.  Yeah, brother Joe.  Have a great weekend, brother Joe.  Congratulations man.  These guys are going to eat and we're going to play your WB 11 performance right now.  Ooh.  Alright, brother Joe.  Thank you.  Thanks a lot guys.  Alright.  My own brother.  It's a good time to be a fan of this radio show.  Thanks brother Joe.  Uh, Derek.  Track one.  Intro into Vertigo.  Very good.  Okay.  Let's check this out from earlier this morning. 
[03:19:30]  Brother Joe and 2U.  All week long we've been introducing you to several local tribute fans in our area.  And as promised, the winner of this week's Battle of the Tribute Fans contest is 2U.  And they are here today to play for us here at 2U performing Vertigo.  This is EdByte.  Well done.  Now we go.  Come on.  On.  Come on, come on. 
[03:20:00]  Come on, come on. 
[03:20:30]  Come on, come on. 
[03:21:00]  Come on, come on. 
[03:21:30]  Come on, come on. 
[03:22:00]  Come on, come on. 
[03:22:30]  Come on, come on. 
[03:23:00]  Come on, come on. 
[03:23:30]  Come on, come on. 
[03:24:00]  Back bag, did the right thing.  Hey, pass.  And are they broadcasting right now?  Yeah.  Actually, they're doing a live broadcast across the country.  Hey, all radio listeners across the country.  That's awesome. 
[03:24:30]  All right.  If we could meet you, too, what would you say to Bono now?  After, before or after I saw it, before or after I saw it, before or after I saw it on myself.  We haven't even thought about it.  I figure the next time we meet him, it'll be in court over some kind of event.  That's a positive way of looking at it.  All right, you guys are performing at Faulkland's tonight at the Bagan Ale House.  It's your brother.  It's your brother.  It's your brother.  It's your brother.  It's your brother.  You know, August Fenn.  August Fenn.  And now take it away with I Will Callow.  Absolutely.  Good song to lead into the weekend.  Good song to lead into the weekend.  It's not my brother.  You hear him?  Sounds like, ah, you sound like Brenda Vaccaro. 
[03:25:00]  Ah.  You were going to ask me for money?  Oh, no, here you go, ma'am.  Here's 20.  Oh, you're a lovely person, Joe.  You're a lovely person.  Please, I got a sick kid, mister.  See your brother shoving a phone into an older man's mouth?  Ah, you sound just like you too, Joe.  Don't put the phone in my mouth.  They are great.  Ah, that was cool.  A little live performance, a little pluggage.  You want a taste of I Will Callow or just Bell here? 
[03:25:30]  Eh.  Well, a little bit.  How about when we leave, you can play it?  Like, we always leave early.  We don't always leave early.  Yes, we do.  Every day we say we're going to leave early, and we never do.  Well, we don't do any filler, any bonus show.  I know what we should do.  Adam 12 is on BCN right now.  He's talking us up big time.  Maybe we do a quick little thing with him before we get out of here for the day.  Like a crossover?  Like a crossover so we can talk to Boston again.  We all wrap it up.  Yeah, we should.  We should do that, right?  Talk to Boston.  All right, just a little taste of I Will Follow, Derek. 
[03:26:00]  Don't taste.  All right, that's good.  We'll be right back.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  We'll be right back. 
[03:26:30]  We'll be right back. 
[03:27:00]  All right, we can figure it out.  Full taste.  Up to you.  Brother Joe's U2 tribute band. 
[03:27:30]  Good job.  Where's Club Soda County?  I got to thank BCN real quick.  They gave me this fantastic signed Aussie poster that's framed beautifully.  It's nice and heavy.  I know.  Look at what they gave him.  It's amazing.  Let me see.  I haven't seen that yet.  Look at this thing.  It's amazing.  Got to take a picture of it so we can put it online and other people can enjoy.  He's getting some really good stuff because you're a pain in the ass.  That was the one I was going to steal from YSP.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  They had that one when I was down there just hanging out and they refused to put me on 
[03:28:00]  the air.  Why did they?  I'm still holding a grudge.  I don't know.  That was in the hallway.  I was just going to grab it.  It's really heavy with a glass frame.  Oh, it's all nicely framed and matted.  Yes.  And beautiful job.  Personally, I would have got museum glass.  But it is really...  Museum glass.  You have to.  Yeah, you definitely have to.  Protect the signature.  That's gorgeous.  Thank you, Dave.  Where's Kenny?  Oh, he's still at IHOP.  He didn't have enough money to pay for breakfast, so he had to wash dishes. 
[03:28:30]  You saved yourself.  Wow, Keith.  Good save with that.  You know any time a joke bombs now.  You just started a new bit, bro.  Sorry, Pat.  All right.  Clown from Munaki.  Can we get Kenny on the phone?  I'm going to see if everything's going all right.  How it went.  At the IHOP and all that.  Or maybe...  Should we do that with BCN?  Can we do another thing with BCN? 
[03:29:00]  Or is that going to be difficult?  You guys check that out.  We got a...  I was...  Quickly, I was listening to the replay yesterday and talking about the prostate exams.  Yeah.  And how perhaps, you know, Jimmy would get one.  Or maybe we can even have, like, listeners who want to.  Have a doctor come in.  Yeah.  Mike them.  If they've never had a prostate exam.  I think it would be kind of funny to Mike them in a private closed room where the doctor  then has to do that and listen to the sounds that the guys make.  Because it would be hysterical. 
[03:29:30]  But Jimmy said, no, I got one.  I got one.  Yeah.  The guy puts the glove on.  And when you said he just puts his finger in and fishes around in there, all I thought  of was the noodling where a big catfish comes out of Jimmy's asshole and bites the good doctor.  Or an intestinal worm or parasite.  He gets bitten by a fucking intestinal parasite.  Something actually draws blood on him and you're in need of further tests.  And so is he. 
[03:30:00]  I would get a prostate exam on the end.  That'd be pretty funny, actually.  All right.  Wait a minute.  Should we play this today?  It all depends on what this is.  Are we going to go back on BC?  What is it?  We're figuring that out.  What is it, Ope?  What is it?  How to eat a watermelon.  Who did that?  This could be the greatest show we've ever done.  Who did that?  I don't know.  Clown?  Oh, I thought perhaps another radio show did it.  That kind of sounds like a whoopee subject. 
[03:30:30]  I don't mean it in a racist way.  I mean it in a dull kind of way.  That's not a compliment either, is it?  No.  Okay.  It's all Cubby's fault.  I love whoopee.  Is back.  Kenny, give us the update.  What's going on at IHOP after we left?  It burnt down.  Not like they couldn't scream out Johnny Cakes enough.  Oh, really?  No, everybody's chowing down.  It's all good.  Did the clown say anything funny?  Are you kidding? 
[03:31:00]  Oh, everyone was stoned.  Even the mouse.  Was he?  Even stoned.  The mouse didn't laugh at that poem.  Hey, everyone got beer and wine in their stocking.  Did they?  You should go on the Wise Guys show for their New Year's Eve special.  The clown and Sonny Ferelli were like vying for everyone's attention.  Of course they were.  We should have someone there recording it.  What about the bill?  You didn't get killed too bad. 
[03:31:30]  I have to go back?  No, I...  How much?  How much?  $3.50 with the tip.  Oh, that's easy.  That's nothing.  That ain't bad.  That's nothing.  Me a bag of shells.  That's right.  Easy come, easy go.  I had it.  I went with it.  I think that's because those people that work for like Dell Technical Service can't add.  Oh, is that it?  Yeah.  Now go.  Ah, Kenny.  Ah.  Ah.  Giant Seinfeld.  Holy shit, was that funny?  That's a new bit waiting to happen now. 
[03:32:00]  Oh, we got to get Seinfeld lines for you now, George.  The challenge has got to write it.  Yeah.  Yeah, we'll write it.  Ah.  That's an easy write.  Ah, Steve, what's going on?  Who are those people?  Steve?  Steve?  They are working on it.  They can absolutely make it happen.  Is this on?  Oh, click them to the computer.  You got to let us know when we're on because...  Is this on?  Is this on?  We just want to thank Boston for having us.  Yeah, they can make it happen.  And I know we're talking to some Boston listeners through XM, but, yeah, we want the big push. 
[03:32:30]  Right.  Right.  Because we're doing that tomorrow evening.  We want to remind them to watch Lucky Louie.  Oh.  That's what we want to do.  Yes.  And I'm cupping my little bag right now, and it feels spectacular.  Why are you doing that?  It just feels good to hold it.  It's so small.  You know what?  It feels like a satchel with two small marbles in it, but the satchel is wet on the bottom.  And the satchel.  That's right. 
[03:33:00]  I don't know how Bill Burr thought this guy was fucking pire in 1977.  We'll find out tomorrow.  Remind me of spitting Bill Burr's hair.  Bastard.  All right.  We're trying to figure out...  Two Jews walking to a bar.  They own the place.  Look at this guy.  Guess who's coming to dinner?  Hopefully a writer. 
[03:33:30]  Holy shit.  Fucking old references.  Went from like, holy shit, that's cool.  Look, it's Clown Guy.  And he's here to...  Oh my god.  What are these hack jokes?  They fell off.  That's awful.  They fell off.  That guy's jokes fell off a shit wagon.  What?  E-Rock is running it.  BCN in 20 seconds.  All right.  Let's not curse.  All right.  All right.  Fuck pussy.  Get out of me.  That's right.  Clint. 
[03:34:00]  All right.  We're going to go back on.  Oh, oh.  With Adam Clown.  No.  You know that's you two on 4.1 WBCN.  And I believe...  Can we go live to ONA in the WBCN studios?  Are you guys there?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hey, you're over there.  Hey, and you're through the window over there.  That's pretty cool, man.  Look at that, dude.  Hey, I know that, dude.  Hey, I know that, dude.  Yeah, we're still here.  We've been doing our satellite show.  Yes, you have.  From in here.  Yes, you have.  And you've been in that closet.  How was breakfast?  It was a lot of fun.  Very good.  Yeah, a lot of listeners down there to IHOP. 
[03:34:30]  Yeah.  Our late afternoon guy was there with you, and he came back and regaled the story on the  air right after we cut away from you guys and went into break that.  Anthony stood up in the middle of the IHOP and went, everybody be cool.  This is a robbery.  Yeah, one of my favorite scenes from Pulp Fiction had acted out.  Well done.  I would have hoped it would have ended in gunfire to a couple of our listeners.  Too bad your favorite scene couldn't have been with a gimp.  We could have got the clown and thrown him over like Marshallist Wacheless. 
[03:35:00]  I'm going to get medieval on here.  Hey, what's up with the strip bus that we took back to BCN?  Know anything about that?  Yes.  Are you still there?  Fingers are pointing.  I'm still here, yeah.  I don't know where it is.  Oh, you do.  You don't know what that's about?  I've been in this box just spinning tunes and waiting for you guys to come back over.  I mean, is it something that is known in town that there's a bus with a bus?  Are you talking about the Bostonian that?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, yeah, absolutely.  We'll rent that out from time to time and throw people on it and do bar crawls and stuff 
[03:35:30]  like that, yeah.  Stripper pole in the middle.  Yes.  Was it used?  Yes.  Well, in the trip back from Opie, by Opie, he just kind of spun around it.  Fantastic.  And then Jimmy got the most naked out of everybody, showing his wonderful boyish, hairless bottom.  And all these pictures will be up on opieandanthony.com, our Boston visit.  Fantastic.  Did you guys enjoy your time back here in Boston?  It must have brought back some memories, right?  I've got to tell you guys, first time we've been back in a while now, and especially at 
[03:36:00]  BCN, maybe four years, a little over four years, I've got to tell you, there's a different  feeling at BCN.  There's a passion.  The passion is back here.  Yes.  You can just feel it, and you guys were just unbelievable to us today.  Very supportive.  Well, on the personal tip, I would like to thank your whole crew for coming back here.  Now that we have you back on mornings, I actually have a shot at making bonus again, which  is a wonderful feeling.  Again, just, you know, that on the personal tip. 
[03:36:30]  Thank you.  Boezy, boezy, bop, kitty bop.  Hey, can we have Club Soda Kenny give the big push for tomorrow's show?  Yes, get him in here, actually.  And while we're waiting to get him in here, I'll actually remind people that they can  go to wbcn.com.  Right on the front page, you'll see Opie and Anthony, and there's a link to the Ticketmaster  page for the Traveling Virus where you can get your tickets.  But Club Soda Kenny, why don't you take care of it, all right?  Oh, hello.  Hello.  Hi, Kenny.  Kenny, now, this is the big plug.  They're letting us get back on BCN.  So we can sell just a few more hundred tickets.  All right, people.  You got to tell them everything.  Listen, don't let us down. 
[03:37:00]  DCU Center tomorrow.  You got to be there.  The O&A Village.  You got the Petting Zoo with all the freaks, all right?  You can, like, see them, all right?  You're going to have, like, a lot of talented people there saying funny things, all right?  So buy your tickets, all right?  Buy your tickets now, and buy your tickets fast.  You're panicking.  Hold on, can I?  It sounds like a bad telethon.  We can all see it.  It sounds like it's a telethon.  You're panicking on us. 
[03:37:30]  I don't want to interrupt this leukemia of a delivery, but you have to mention where they  can get the tickets and some of the guys that are on the show.  Yeah.  Club Soda.  Tell them Andrew Dice Gay is going to be there.  Oh, yeah.  And let me tell you something about Andrew Dice Gay.  Yeah.  He's going to be over the top.  It's a big production for him.  Is he going to rely on my jacket?  Jacket.  Glasses.  I need some glasses.  A cigarette.  Music.  Yeah.  You can go cigarette. 
[03:38:00]  Annette.  Annette.  Cigarette.  Ew.  Yeah.  I like that.  Me and Double J go in the back seat, and we take care of business because I'm Andrew Dice  Gay.  Oh.  I'm a faggot.  Uglies.  Uglies.  Uh-oh.  Adam 12, bear with us for a minute.  I got my finger on the button.  Don't worry about it.  I was expecting Andrew Dice Gay.  Oh, you don't need your finger on the button.  Where do I need my finger, Andrew Dice Gay?  I understand the rules and the nercurations of the radio programs. 
[03:38:30]  I can keep it clean.  Thank you, Andrew Dice Gay.  There's certain things that I...  Because he used to be Andrew Dice Clay.  Yes.  Now I'm Andrew Dice...  Can I talk here?  Certainly.  Hey, hey, now it's Andrew Dice Gay.  No.  Because I'm with the alternative lifestyle.  Weren't you sensitive, Dice Clay, for a short period of time as well?  Yeah, I put myself out there, and no one paid attention. 
[03:39:00]  I had the lesbians after me and the gay gentlemen, and I sort of built up what they call a love  for these people.  So I incorporated it into my...  And now it's a little different than it was.  I don't think many people will notice.  Because it's still the rhymes.  You want to hear the rhymes?  Absolutely.  Everybody.  Hickory Dickory Duck. 
[03:39:30]  You're a guy.  Can I shock you?  Oh, I love it.  I love it in the face.  Anywhere.  Oh, geez.  You got another one there, Dice.  My jacket is...  Remember the old days?  Yeah.  It was bedazzled.  It said the Dice Man on it.  Now it's just faggot spelt in...  Oh! 
[03:40:00]  There wasn't a woman lived in a shoe.  I don't know her.  Because I'm a faggot.  Jack, be nimble.  Jack, be quick.  Come over here.  I'll...  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  I just love the... 
[03:40:30]  Right goddamn template, idiot.  I just love the...  I can't get enough...  In my...  I put it everywhere.  In my...  Up my...  In the...  Through the...  I don't care if it's on my...  In my...  On my...  My hair gets covered in...  I don't care.  Put it in the...  Or the...  Or my...  In the...  Through my... 
[03:41:00]  I'm not a satisfied fan.  Thank you.  Come again.  Well, we want to thank everyone here at BCN for having us.  Dave Wellington and, of course, Adam 12 and the rest of the gang that made this possible.  You guys really gave us a nice presentation here.  We really appreciate it.  Thank you.  And we've got to thank John Valby for stopping by.  It was great.  He's going to be at the Comedy Connection tonight in Boston. 
[03:41:30]  I'm going to the show.  Yeah, I'm going to go see him, definitely.  Yeah, we've got to go see John Valby tonight.  So I think there's a few tickets available for that.  Adam 12, thanks, man.  Thank you, guys.  Again, welcome back to Boston.  It's great to have you here in person.  I hope we get to do this again real soon.  Thank you, Angel.  Turn us off so we can start cursing again.  All right, fellas.  Curse away.  Peace.  I'm Chris Tremblay.  And I want to help you protect your investment.  We're back on XM only now?  Yeah.  I like XM.  I love the cock in my ass, in my mouth.  I love cum all over my fucking back. 
[03:42:00]  That's what I like.  A big, fat, black cock in my fucking ass is a dream come true.  I love it.  Come here, you black fuck.  Unclipped black cock in my ass hole.  Oh, we're still on BCN.  I hate the cunt. 
[03:42:30]  Hate it.  It smells silly.  It smells silly.  It smells silly.  Oh, please.  So I'm online at the bank.  And I got my tongue up this guy's ass.  Because I'm a faggot.  No joke.  No joke.  It just happened.  I needed some money.  Very good. 
[03:43:00]  We got to get out of here.  Yeah.  I'm tired.  Okay.  Okie doke.  No argument for me.  Meetings or something?  Have fun at those.  We have meetings every day.  Today it's a luncheon with salespeople.  Here in Boston.  I'd rather get my fucking teeth fixed by Goebbels.  Don't get it, man.  Nice reference.  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Got any of your Rommel jokes? 
[03:43:30]  Ah!  Ah!  She's hot like the desert fox.  Ah!  Ah!  All right.  We'll see on Monday.  Oh, someone's got to remind us.  We didn't get to it.  What a great tease, though.  How to eat a watermelon.  Where did we get this, Steve?  It was a...  It was a...  Hey, Steve.  Mike.  Mike.  I know, Jimmy.  Thank you.  It's one of those viral videos that has been going around for a while.  Yeah.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  And he cut it up this morning, and I've seen it.  It's cut it up.  Quite interesting.  Excuse me. 
[03:44:00]  This is the...  Ah!  This is Greg Hughes, the actor that plays Opie on the opening show.  Oh, hi, Greg.  Hi.  There he is.  Wow.  Welcome aboard.  Welcome aboard, everybody, by the way.  Welcome aboard, Greg.  I recognize him.  I've seen him.  I want to thank our staff.  Oh.  This has been the smoothest broadcast on the road.  Absolutely.  Has it?  In a very...  Yes.  In a very, very long time.  I didn't realize we haven't been on the road in years.  With the exception of Steve, Eric, and Nathaniel, things were terrific. 
[03:44:30]  What?  I said, good job today.  So thanks to Stan, Club Soda Kenny, and Steve.  Yep.  Who else is up here with us?  Stan.  I said that.  Stan.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  Keith.  The lovely ladies of the O&H show.  I'm sorry, Keith.  Yes.  And Jaime.  Keep the cop.  All the hot chicks who smelled good in the studio.  Yes.  Really nice.  And Jaime.  Jaime.  Jaime.  Jaime.  Jaime.  Jaime.  Jaime.  Jaime.  Jaime.  Jaime.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  She's a virgin. 
[03:45:00]  She got her Jaime broken.  Ah.  Ah.  I got to communicate from Stan.  And this is word for word.  Sure.  Plug the guys back at XM.  I guess.  Ah.  All right.  I guess.  Good job, Derek.  And his hot chick there, Travis.  Good job.  And who else is back there?  Mars.  Ah, Sam.  Ah, Sam.  Young Sam and Master Poe.  I don't know what Poe did today.  What's that?  Security.  Don't mention Danny.  Don't mention Danny.  Why would I?  Danny.  Why would I? 
[03:45:30]  You look like the fucking Green Goblin, you creep.  You non-smoking creep.  Non-smoking.  Why don't you shove a cigar up your cunt?  We should have some.  We should have some.  Ah.  Save this.  We should have some good stories when we're back on the radio on Monday.  Our trip to Boston continues.  What?  Bill?  Bill who?  Bill and Carolyn from BC.  Oh, Bill who looks like Keith's brother?  That's right.  And Carolyn.  Well, he does it like Keith the cop.  Wait, you say it.  I can't read your writing.  I didn't write that.  Dave wrote it.  Bill?  Oh, Dave Wellington. 
[03:46:00]  What's up, Dave?  Jesus.  It's the second time you did that.  It's almost an Elo kind of thing, but...  I'm afraid that my picture's going to be broken in the mail.  No.  I'm happy.  Take it with you.  No, because I'm afraid it'll be broken during the trip.  Give me this.  You took the tutu?  Give me this.  I'm throwing it.  I don't do.  That's a good one.  That's signed.  Yeah, but you don't like the glass anyway, you said.  I love museum glass.  Come on.  No, I'm not going to get a change.  I'm going to leave that.  Please.  Thank you.  I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to interrupt your plug, Steve.  I apologize.  No, I just wanted to say thank you to Bill and Carolyn, who helped out a great deal here 
[03:46:30]  at BCN.  There's a lot of Bill and Carolyn.  Fucking Academy Awards.  Bill, who?  Thank you.  Yeah.  Everybody that helped.  Why don't you thank the bus driver?  Thank all the people that made it possible.  You're right, Jim.  Thank the bus driver.  I wanted to just say thank you to mom and dad, all right?  Come here.  I want to give you a hug.  Finally.  And thank you to Hezbollah.  He's coming toward you.  For being the only people who are hairier than I am.  He's coming at you.  Look how scared Jimmy gets.  He gets all scared.  Oh, Jimmy.  A big hug.  It's actually a hard-on masquerading as fear. 
[03:47:00]  Finally.  Don't forget to watch Lucky Louie on HBO, Sunday night at 10.30.  That's right.  Starring Jimmy Norton.  In this episode, I mouthfuck Jerry Minor.  He's the black gentleman.  I get my mouth fucking.  And with that, we say adieu.  Till Monday.  Obi and Anthony, broadcasting live from Boston, where every day is St. Paddy's day. 
[03:47:30]  Oh, my God!  Oh, my God!  Oh, my God!  Oh, my God! </pre>
