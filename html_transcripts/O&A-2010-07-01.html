<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often transitioning abruptly between them.  It began with the hosts' usual chaotic mic checks and self-deprecating jokes about the show's quality.  A news story about a "flying car" led to a lengthy, rambling discussion about its impracticality and the potential for airborne traffic chaos, incorporating humorous, often offensive, stereotypes.  This segued into a discussion of Robert Moses, his controversial urban planning, and accusations of racism.  The conversation then jumped to a series of films, including *Back to the Future*, *Chitty Chitty Bang Bang*, *The Absent-Minded Professor*, and *Gus*, focusing on their absurd plots and memories associated with them, particularly the questionable racial humor in *Gus*.  The flying car topic was revisited, concluding with the hosts' assertion that widespread adoption was unlikely.  They then discussed censorship on terrestrial radio, citing examples of banned phrases involving farts, racial slurs, and sexual innuendo.  The segment concluded with a discussion of LeBron James's free agency and one host's experience with his son's projectile vomiting.  Multiple callers contributed throughout.

The next segment began with a debate about whether Led Zeppelin credited Willie Dixon for musical inspiration, prompting a research attempt involving the hosts and a caller.  One host then shared a personal anecdote about being caught masturbating in front of his girlfriend, leading to further discussion of relationships and embarrassment.  Listener feedback on a previous Alex Jones interview followed, with the hosts vehemently defending their handling of the interview against criticism from callers deemed "conspiracy theorist babies."  This led to a discussion of conspiracy theories and the difficulty of maintaining neutrality.  The lawsuit filed against Led Zeppelin by Jake Holmes was then discussed, with a caller who worked for Holmes providing details and suggesting connections to songs like "Stairway to Heaven."  Attempts to contact experts like a deceased DJ and Julian Assange were mentioned. The segment concluded with a lengthy discussion of Tiger Woods's divorce settlement, speculating on the reasons for the high payout, including potential steroid use and undisclosed information,  followed by a tangent about a New York cop killer whose death sentence was overturned.  The upcoming season of *Jersey Shore* and a 7-Eleven gift card contest were also briefly mentioned.  Numerous callers participated, contributing to the show's chaotic nature.  The language used throughout this segment was consistently vulgar and profane.


The following segment opened with a recounting of a chaotic show finale where an unknown "knockoff crazy" fan grabbed the microphone and launched into a political rant, prompting a near-violent reaction from a host.  The revelation that the heckler was homosexual highlighted the potential for a media firestorm.  The conversation then shifted to the hosts' upcoming stand-up gigs in Atlantic City, comparing ticket sales and promotional pressures.  The concurrent UFC fight, frustrations with modern technology (iPhones and iPads), anxieties about data loss, and the obsolescence of older technology formats were discussed.  An anecdote about comedian Bobby Kelly's reckless handling of a PDA was shared, along with discussions of commercial versus private flying, airline pilot anecdotes, and UFO sightings.  Later, Dr. Steve called to discuss his eye condition and upcoming "Weird Medicine" segments, including a planned "vodka tampon challenge."  The new season of *Jersey Shore* was discussed, along with the in-studio appearance of pornographic film actresses Ryan Keely and Jade Vixen, who promoted their event and shared a story of Jade's abduction by an obsessive fan.  The segment ended with further discussion of *Jersey Shore* and banter with the female guests.  The segment contained numerous vulgar terms, sexual references, and discussions of potentially illegal and dangerous activities.


The final segment featured a caller, Jade, recounting a terrifying experience involving a stalker who murdered her boyfriend, abducted, and sexually assaulted her before ultimately committing suicide.  The conversation then shifted to Jade's experiences and the impact on her trust in people, detailing her increased withdrawal and distrust.  Ryan Keely, a porn star, was a guest in the studio, and the conversation became sexually explicit, detailing Ryan's experiences in the adult film industry, his upcoming sex seminar ("Pornstar Sex Life"),  various sexual practices (including urethral sounding), and his views on sexual techniques and communication.  The hosts and Ryan discussed various sexual acts and preferences using explicit language and graphic descriptions. Ryan described an experience using a strap-on due to unsatisfactory oral sex from a straight woman during filming.  Anecdotes about Keith Moon's sexual exploits and the hosts' own experiences were also shared.  Dr. Steve was mentioned again, described as engaging in questionable behavior like making wine with kerosene. The show concluded with promotions for Ryan's sex seminar and the hosts' upcoming appearances.

[00:00:00]  our show is stupid this is so irresponsible this should be illegal  it really should be it's like it's so unethical god i hate fucking radio  this could be the worst audio ever shut up shut your fucking mouth 
[00:00:30]  this is terrible we just suck all around i hope you show restraint in fucking my girlfriend  this stinks fucking shut the fuck up we get it get it but enough of this palaver let's get the show  on the road yes okay that was a mic check sorry hi hi yeah yuck 
[00:01:00]  yuck to having to adjust things every morning i'll tell you one thing never changes from  school till i think retirement is the day before vacation and this is the day before vacation  and the complete lack of enthusiasm to be there i'm kidding of course this is a pleasure  this is a pleasure absolutely and enough about showing me the flying car it's not a flying car 
[00:01:30]  that's an airplane it's an airplane that looks like a car stop it people go to finally got a  flying car no i just blurted that out because i saw a picture on the news it's not a flying car  well what makes a flying car and what makes an airplane an airplane's a fucking airplane it's  got some wings it's got a tail it's got the fucking rudder it's got all the all the things  an airplane flying car is like jetsons well it's like it just takes off and you go well then we're  never gonna get the flying car because you need the wings and shit for a flying car i know which 
[00:02:00]  makes it an airplane which means we already have the flying car yeah we have the flying car it's  called an airplane we've always had it's just been called an airplane you can only drive it on a  runway that's it though and then it's in the air and then you got what are they talking about with  this flying car thing they're just that's a flying car that now we're googling flying cars if they got  stuff that it looks like see that isn't a flying car that's a airplane that kind of looks like a car  for a fuselage well how do you tuck in the wings after you land so you could drive normal roadways 
[00:02:30]  without knocking out pedestrians as they're walking down the sidewalk or you know what else about a  flying car you can't have a flying car that if somebody taps you you got to take it in for  hundreds of thousands of dollars in repairs right because it hit your wing while he was parallel  parking like like you can't just drive that around and if it gets a ding it's okay because you got to  unfold the wings and fly it and if someone hit your like fucking aileron you're screwed i i don't know 
[00:03:00]  imagine if we all had flying cars what a disaster that would be we can't even drive on flats flying cars  would be falling out of the sky left and right we suck in two dimensions never mind adding a  fucking third right can you imagine people would be just falling on top of each other imagine you're  dealing with airspace with asians oh and and they're in their flying cars you think there'd be  problems there would be many problems just flying like shit not sure how high they want to be yes 
[00:03:30]  they're up here they're down here they're all over the place absolutely flying car means  delorean from back to the future two that is like flying car it flies it's a car i don't know how it  does it but it just does it's 2010 for fuck's sake so wings stop with the wings already but what's the  latest version of the flying car that we just saw on tv that's the it's an airplane yeah i know i i saw the 
[00:04:00]  headline last night like we got a flying car and then i saw the picture too this morning and and  thought to myself yeah it's just another plane yeah they're bamboozling us again we need stuff with  like turbines in there that they're lifted up like a harrier but even that would be you know not quite  flying car but at least it's not wings and then if there was a flying car don't they have to change  all the rules of the roadway you can't just all of a sudden have planes like start taking off taking  off and going you know what now i want to land on the li right about here because this is my exit 
[00:04:30]  coming up yeah yeah how do you turn it from a flying thing to a car thing and and how does the  the state the country the the local laws allow this yeah how do you get back onto the road exactly you  can't just land on the road you can't just decide tomorrow okay flying cars are now allowed in  manhattan so are they going to be landing strips with on ramps so like you land right and then you  drive and you're you're on an on-ramp to the expressway right so but there's designated landing 
[00:05:00]  areas for the flying car it's it's way too complicated and with all the red tape and all  the bullshit that we deal with now none of these exciting things will ever happen in our life never  ever happen you ever like you ever i don't know travel or or just travel around america and see  some of the shit they got done you're like oh how the fuck they do that we don't do that type of  stuff anymore no because it just costs way too much money costs too much got too much of that  what they call red tape a lot of red tape yeah and a screw now costs a thousand dollars or something 
[00:05:30]  yeah and then some environmental group has a problem with building that imagine like the friggin like  boulder dam and some of those giant dams they made out west how you could never do that again  that's what i'm getting at yeah there'd be environmental groups saying no there's a fucking  beetle bug there that you've seen the documentary on robert moses right and all the shit he accomplished  and you think to yourself that would never happen in in 2010 nope because we have some major major issues 
[00:06:00]  in in the new york city area but they're not gonna take on these massive projects anymore they're just  not is is the robert moses being a huge racist true i don't know because of the parkway i i've i've heard  i've heard that too they they i mean the big rumor is that the parkways out on long island  uh they're not even rumors the overpasses you can't you can't really fit trucks and buses no  trucks aren't allowed on there trucks aren't allowed at all yeah obviously yeah but they said the reason 
[00:06:30]  they did that was so the the city buses couldn't bring the uh the schwuggies to the beach to the  beaches on long island that's that's been a rumor forever that they they made these parkways with  these really low overpasses which they are sometimes you drive your car under him because  the guy was brilliant with with his ideas yeah why would he do that you know he he loved destroying  entire neighborhoods to get his stupid road built get his dumb highways but the guy was brilliant and  and he would make that mistake where the overpasses would be a bit short but suppose it was like they 
[00:07:00]  didn't want the schwuggies at the beaches didn't want them bust in they didn't want to bust in that's  that's the big rumor that's been around for a really long time uh brilliant man i i i love that  guy though he just decided you know what we need a highway here and he didn't care who lived there  no no just you've seen that documentary right sunday yeah with you you watch him just plowing  through entire neighborhoods that have been there since uh whatever the the start of life in the new  york area didn't care and him and his heavy equipment just plowed plowed everyone's lives right over 
[00:07:30]  everyone had to relocate so they could get a highway in so they could just put robert moses dumb  highway in all sorts of highways and they named up beach after him cross bronx expressway i'm sure  that ripped up a neighborhood or two yeah uh the li certainly ripped up a neighborhood or two  yep i guess that most okay uh biographer robert carrow argues that moses also demonstrated racist  tendencies he along with other members of the new york city planning commission were vocal opponents 
[00:08:00]  against black war veterans moving into stuyvesant town a manhattan residential complex created uh to  house world war ii veterans oh really so he didn't want uh i think he was uh racist he probably was  yeah what are you gonna do i think everybody was back then what are you gonna do yeah i think i  just all were you know i think you're right everybody anyone i think you're right power because  all the neighborhoods were pretty much separated so yeah if if you didn't you know belong in that 
[00:08:30]  neighborhood you were yeah stay out yes yeah so the uh the flying car is a joke another car joke  it's a plane flying cars are like the delorean and back to the future too it takes off you don't know  how it does it the wheels tuck in and uh you're off yeah it doesn't make sense it certainly doesn't  also let's say uh in january okay you're allowed to fly cars yeah really how do you get that done 
[00:09:00]  who's allowed to fly cars yeah i'd like to see that driving test too people can't even parallel  fucking park they're gonna be drop flying their cars around old people stepping on the wrong pedals  sure hey you know what i didn't know this this is a robert moses parkway in the buffalo area  eric and buffalo go ahead eric yeah yeah we got one right out here just outside of niger falls  i don't know if it's to keep them out of buffalo or keep them uh in in buffalo but yeah there's one  kind of split niger falls and it it really sucks up a lot of trucking and stuff like that wait but but 
[00:09:30]  the same thing where the uh the overpasses are too short yeah exactly what was he thinking he was  thinking what was he thinking he was thinking buses that was a man who could see into the future  oh my god that robert moses what a visionary unbelievable he knew there wouldn't be any  flying cars all right thank you sir mj in manhattan we're talking about the flying car out of nowhere  today but that's the beauty of us we didn't even know we were going to talk about it popped up on 
[00:10:00]  the tv what do you got mj hey good morning boys good morning you know in back to the future part two  the old beth takes a cab to hill valley now here in manhattan i'm already afraid to get into taxi  cabs because the drivers all look like terrorists now imagine having the flying taxi cab here in  manhattan oh my god can you imagine right be a suicide mission you know yeah they already look  like terrorists and now you're gonna get into a flying cab you end up flying into a building oh my  god with this cab no thank you no sorry thank you sir this guy's got info on the flying car oh great 
[00:10:30]  west in dallas it's been our dream to have the flying car what do you got on it  well what i got is basically the thing that uh depends on a electronic highway in the sky a bunch  of radar beams that will put you on autopilot and direct you from place to place so what are you  saying a month or two i think that it's going to take considerably longer to install the infrastructure  for that one the intra intra intra uh infra infrastructure sorry yeah it would take forever 
[00:11:00]  just to get that built please so we could accept the the whole flying car culture regular planes the  faa and the air traffic control it takes and and just all that imagine having to put that in place  for everybody that has a flying car and if it if it's drizzling they shut down airports so so you as  joe commuter and you're flying car how are you gonna make the call you're gonna know not to fly 
[00:11:30]  that day i'm late i got real i'm gonna give it a shot i'm just gonna try to fly in this storm  with my car and then you end up just crashing and let's let's call it right here in uh in 2010  july 1st 2010 opie and anthony are calling it there will never be a flying car no flying car there will  always be airplanes resign not be flying cars for you and i just resign yourself yes fact there won't be  flying oh you know what this is a very good point trucker bob a movie that i uh i saw many many  times because i think my my mom uh uh i don't know wanted us out of the fucking house go ahead 
[00:12:00]  trucker bob morning boys hey hello yeah you know that dates way back you know if it's fixing to  break down you can always push that bitch mary poppins out and ride her umbrella to the ground you  know well what about chitty chitty bang bang is that what you're talking about yeah have you have  seen the movie i've i've seen chitty chitty bang bang shitty shitty bang bang what an awful  fucking movie i think that played at the northport movie theater and and back then movies stayed in 
[00:12:30]  theaters for months flying car that sounds like this  yeah that's what you want to hear 5 000 feet in the air 10 000 feet in the air whatever it would be  but those stupid how did it fly how did chitty chitty bang bang fly it didn't have wings man  no did it have little bat wings that came out of the side i don't think so i think it was just an  old school car that was in the air let me see the chitty chitty bang bang car danny why yes look  it had stupid wings it did look it's not even aerodynamic that that's stupid how would that fly 
[00:13:00]  it's not flying i didn't know it looked like that it looks like it drove over a hang glider  hey they had imaginations back then right no they didn't i love trucker bob you rocker bob  our movies sucked when we were growing up who are you kidding we didn't have no fucking avatar  why does it have in the front it has like a weird way in the front like it's a canard wing in the  front what's a canard wing a canard wing what is a canard wing it's like all the shit that's in 
[00:13:30]  the back of a plane is in the front but why you got a few things up front that would slow it down or  something yeah that would make it flop end over end now they figured it out they figured out the  canard not for the chitty chitty bang bang vehicle some of the supersonic planes have canard wings  the front like that yeah i don't know why they put it on shitty shitty wait do you mean like a uh the  concord yeah you get like an elevator type deal going uh in the front instead of in the back 
[00:14:00]  canard canard let's go to rich on long island rich canard wing hey guys what about you know  when the car runs out of gas you see them on the side of the road how about when you're in the air  what the hell you do that yeah yeah yeah how's that work people wouldn't be responsible enough  to make sure they have enough gas they would they would do what you do with cars i think i can make  it you push it yeah i think i can make it to the next exit lean over to the left so it looks like  the gauge is a little further you've done that too oh yeah you've done the lean yeah i think that's 
[00:14:30]  okay i think i can make it to cleveland today and then you rationalize that the car company wouldn't  have put the dead empty right when it hits empty they'll give you a little more they they understand  how people drive that's what i tell people in my car all the time when i see that fucking light  going i'm like yeah they gave you a little extra they know it we're fine who's they and then i do  quick math for everybody in the car how many miles per gallon i get and a gallon isn't even  going to show up on the gas gauge but we can go at least 20 more miles highway that worked well until 
[00:15:00]  i broke down in uh cape cod in the middle of nowhere and got picked up by the hippies in the  van with the fucking uh you remember the story with the chain and the lock they locked me into the  van to get me to a gas station with a bunch of other hippies yeah goddamn oh by the way i wasn't  in my 20s that only happened a couple years ago yeah very irresponsible on my part  uh opus thinking of the absent-minded professor which featured the model t that flew without  wings that was a flubber which got it to fly man i was thinking i was thinking chitty chitty bang bang 
[00:15:30]  but this was the uh the model t car that that flew yes that was um with uh what's his name mcmurray  the absent-minded professor i want to see the model t in the air oh they have the  yeah that was the the remake with robin williams oh flying car rubber oh man up  yuck yuck yuck yuck look at that the absent-minded professor look at this not a hint of a wing on 
[00:16:00]  that one that looks so stupid they weren't even trying to fool around with the concept here's what  i didn't understand flubber was like this rubbery stuff that made uh things bounce very high right  and uh they put it on the shoes of the basketball team in the at the college right and the all-white  basketball team was really good in that because paris the thought of negro was in that a disney  movie why didn't the refs why didn't the refs disqualify that team they were flying through the 
[00:16:30]  air there was obvious shenanigans going obvious shenanigans but they couldn't figure it out there  was flubber it was all it was up to the refs to say you know what get the fuck off the basketball  court but i understand the bounce thing but then how did the car just fly because the car didn't  start bouncing it just decided flubber now was something that uh defied gravity uh constantly  and could just make things was it one big bounce i was stupid fred mcmurray did he go with one big  bounce one big bounce maybe yeah but he was steering around with it and shit how many compound fractures 
[00:17:00]  did those boys suffer from bouncing oh i know landing on their fucking basketball court spinal column  damage and fucking joint problems well at least it was uh what was what was the other disney film  where the stupid animal kicked the football there was some really bad disney where am i thinking of  something else wasn't a donkey or a mule or something and they fucking they always had animals doing  things becoming a mayor like a dog becomes the mayor or something what the fuck is that the whole  town has to accept this shitty movies the kids these days get toy story three which looks amazing 
[00:17:30]  and we had fucking chitty chitty bang bang wouldn't you just take the dog out if it became the mayor  of your little town yeah why would you accept that what why would you accept that what was the one  called the shaggy something there were a bunch of shaggy something was that the shaggy dog the shaggy  dog and what did he become i don't know remember air bud there was like five different air bud  movies like every different sport that might be what i was thinking about no see we're from different 
[00:18:00]  generations too new yeah air bud is for your generation we're going way back and the real  air bud dies uh old school disney right after you made air bud yeah died so it couldn't even like  enjoy its fame oh the shaggy da that was it the dog was the district attorney the fuck is that about  the shaggy da if your boss was a dog wouldn't you be a little pissed off yes you'd be a little 
[00:18:30]  why was the dog the district attorney who pitched that idea dean jones and tim conway  in walt disney's the shaggy da tim conway is a funny motherfucker though he certainly is but jesus christ  i like the tim conway how do you throw a guy in jail forever on the word of a prosecutor  with hair all over him and a little pink dick just licking his balls instead of telling the jury  making a shit on the floor closing statement he's just fucking licking his lipstick his little red 
[00:19:00]  dick licking that yellow crud off of his red dick but he's wearing glasses man yeah he's smart he's  looking the part at least of a da wouldn't you appeal that wouldn't you appeal if you were prosecuted  by a dog yeah what is it's laughter by the pound is that the same one yes yeah probably let me go  to striker uh striker has something on the flying car what infrastructure actually i got something on 
[00:19:30]  both subjects yeah missing the shaggy dog part he was a human who turned into a dog when nobody was  around he wasn't a dog all the time so he was the district attorney and then he would turn into a  dog and and shit on the floor you could involve something like that uh as far as the flying cars  anthony it'd be very easy to set up the infrastructure we already have it you would just take and use  retrofit light poles with uh assembly on top that would create delayed designators in the sky 
[00:20:00]  yeah but how the fuck how do you fucking land your flying car while all the people are just driving  regularly because it'll be just like old school shit remember when they started introducing the car  into america but they still had the horse and buggies and they had to get along with each other  so how the fuck do you get your flying car down back on the highway with the other dopes that can't  afford a flying car yet you're saying how does the bleed over work when there's a is it called  the bleed over i think so i'm just i'm just naming it yeah all right yeah that's a good way to look at 
[00:20:30]  it how is that gonna work striker um very simple using the uh high-oxidated vehicle lane like we have  in other parts in the words of anthony doesn't make sense plus uh you live way out there in denver  right colorado area somewhere something there's a little more room out there sir and here's another  problem retrofitting the light poles with some kind of navigation system means that the flying 
[00:21:00]  cars would be right over the highways so any problem you have takes out the fucking highway  no you'd want these things not near the highway so you'd have to have a separate highway flying for  flying cars then if you got a flying car why the fuck are you following the highway i want to go as  the crow flies to work well you could still do that yeah your primary but your primary routing  would be using you know you would create delay i don't want to i don't want to follow the curves 
[00:21:30]  of the road that's right i don't want to follow that shit why would you follow that shit if you don't  have to i got a flying car i'm going point a to point b shortest distance my friend anthony you  already don't follow the rules of the road so what difference does it make that is true all right so  tend to drive on sidewalks so imagine imagine anthony in a flying car oh how crazy that would be  that'd be great in a flying car striker we already called it there will never be a flying car never  multi-pass how about a what flying semi flying semi we can't even get the rocket pack uh figured out 
[00:22:00]  that yeah that's great i thought we would have figured out the rocket pack by now you got one  guy risking his life at a sporting event to do a little show off thing with a rocket pack that's  all we got it's not like you go out and buy one and just rocket pack yourself somewhere that rocket  pack thing looks like it could be cool it looks so dangerous it's got to be the most dangerous thing  you could do on earth how many people are going to shoot up and crack their skulls on things 
[00:22:30]  it just looks like a balloon letting all the air out just going through the sky just winging  through and you fucking knock your head into a building yeah gust will take you right against  the side of the building until you'll kill office workers jet pack my ass two things uh the mule  kicking the football was a fine movie called gus thanks for everybody in instant feedback gus uh was  on a football team anthony and he and he kicked winning field goals yeah for the team yes and no one  no one saw a problem with this no one had a problem with a mule being uh the kicker of on a 
[00:23:00]  football team right do we have the movies we have the trailer for gus or that was another disney film  yeah yeah another great disney film of an animal doing so how many fucking dumb movies did they  make us sit through well where animals were doing things everyone knows the movies though they  were that popular it's all we had what crap they gave us they fed us just shit yeah this new 
[00:23:30]  generation has fucking avatar we had we had a stupid mule kicking football oh my god how do we even  fucking relate to these people anymore it's we're fucking no wonder they hate us though no wonder  the younger generation has no respect for us right it's what you faggots found entertaining oh there  you go gus 1976 was that bob crane's last movie somebody's saying that in here who's that uh bob  crane really was bob oh my god don knots was in gus don knots was in it why is there a helmet on the 
[00:24:00]  donkey with a with an atom on the side of it like a nuclear uh uh little symbol well that was the name  of the group the atoms the band the uh the team the atom oh the atoms well they had to make it  futuristic they were like a nerdy team and what they got their walt disney don knots collection  he has a fucking football helmet on with a hole cut for his big dumb donkey ears who's gonna tackle  that fucking thing braying and biting with its teeth and why does he need a helmet yeah you ever hit a  donkey in the head and it's not getting hurt and could it really kick accurately wouldn't it be just 
[00:24:30]  willy-nilly every time he tried kicking a football he would just go and shit by the ball  time out fucking asshole animal he did it once his tail slowly goes up you see his asshole pucker  and fucking collapse and and little shits come out you're not far off because all these movies  there was some kind of catch where they had to give the the thing something to do its its special 
[00:25:00]  skill yes i don't know what it would be in this case they would pinch its cock really hard  that would kick you oh yes mr surfing any footage of the fucking donkey uh kicking  oh who doesn't want to see that there has to be come on i i think even youtube said you know what  let's not put fucking gus clips up here gus gus the mule gus the mule uh there was a there was  another one some fucking some some woman from from tijuana to suck its dick before it kicks 
[00:25:30]  shoots a big donkey load in her face he has a bachelor party jerking off right in front of the  football just spies gus gus stinks his helmet really made me angry because his legs would break  if he got tackled his he's all clumsy oh yeah very clumsy no gus clips how could there be a gus clip  no one cares well no one cares kicking fucking footballs man no that's not the i what was the 
[00:26:00]  movie uh broomsticks something bed knobs and broomsticks someone is reminding me that uh the bed in that  movie with the flu really they had a flying bed so i thought it was about a girl's first foray  into masturbation an uncle bed knobs and broomsticks escape to which mountain that was another one  that had what something flying yeah something's always flying back then everything was flying  how the fuck was that about uh fascinated with with flying things all right let's say how to screw in 
[00:26:30]  jersey screw hey screw what's up guys oh yeah good evening good evening man screw uh you were talking  before uh robert moses being a possible racer yeah okay um when the dodgers wanted the new stadium  the way they wanted it was where the new uh next stadium was gonna be yeah and uh he he was the one  who stopped it he was like the uh zoning commissioner or whatever he was yeah he's the yeah i mean just 
[00:27:00]  to cut to the chase he's the reason uh we lost the dodgers and the giants you're right yeah yeah yeah  he was yeah all he gave his shit about was highways he loved his roads he loved tar they find that odd  and kind of ironic yeah what shut down robert moses if i remember the documentary correctly he wanted a  highway to come right into manhattan which we have but it stopped as soon as you get out of the tunnel or 
[00:27:30]  over the bridge right yeah he wanted the highway to continue it would sweep around so you'd get a  nice solid left turn for all the locals out there say from the lie and then the highway would continue  all the way to downtown to like wall street area really and that would have just ripped manhattan  completely in half and that's when the locals finally said you know what enough with your stupid  fucking roads moses what was robert moses he a mayor or he was uh that's a very good question  developer he was a robber baron i don't know what he was he was a carpetbagger just old words for 
[00:28:00]  people i don't know what he was a mudslinger he was a coal burner he was an oil driller  i don't know what he uh what he was i don't know what his official title was all you had to be  was rich obviously all you had to be was rich back then right like the rockefellas and stuff and  you're like you have like money you're like the guy on the monopoly fucking board and shit the  illuminati and then and then you could do things yeah you could do whatever you want whatever you 
[00:28:30]  want kevin in connecticut what's up sir good morning guys hey hello don not's finest uh acting was in  uh as a fish incredible mr limpet yeah he turned into a don not's cartoon fish how the hell did that  happen he fell overboard i think right but you can't just turn into a fish if you fall over  i know he turned into a fish that looked like don not's but we need all the we we need all the 
[00:29:00]  twists in these movies how did he turn into a fish you just don't turn into a fish was there some kind  of chemical reaction or something no it was his own in his own mind he turned into a fish he fell  in love with another fish and was he drowning was it he dove in the water and i guess he became a  fish oh really he died that's not it here's the answer the name is in it's mr limpet he could no  longer achieve an erection and his wife was humiliating him in front of his friends and she  said he had a fish dick she said old fish dick because it was floppy his fish was like a little 
[00:29:30]  fucking guppy like a dead minnow his fish was like a little his fish his dick whatever yes  he turned into abe vagoda  did he join the army the fish joined the army i think mr limpet the fish mr limpet joined the army  and became like a underwater fucking like army thing or navy something  all right let me let me thank you sir let's go to uh sean we're trying to learn a little more about 
[00:30:00]  this gust movie that's the one i'm obsessed with today uh sean and idaho  hey good morning good morning show there i remember this movie from wild war uh when the  disney was on nbc way back when and the guy who held the ball for the field goals was the owner of  the donkey yeah and they lived on a farm somewhere in europe and when he said a certain code word  and it kind of sounded like a sneeze the donkey would kick his leg and so he brought him to america 
[00:30:30]  started and the team with the adams were a terrible football team could never score of course so  they would kick this donkey would kick 80 90 yard field goal a 90 yard field goal  yeah because they could never make it past third down so he would like make some kind of sound like  a sneeze yeah he would kick a 90 yard field goal and then they started winning somebody is saying  that the word was oiaj yeah yeah that was it oiaj what the fuck does oiaj mean so the guy holding 
[00:31:00]  the ball who owned the mule would have to say oiaj probably a derogatory term it's an anti-semitic  term now what was the twist in the movie because the mule couldn't get away with this the entire  movie obviously something had to go wrong where now the team's depressed like oh fuck our secret  weapon is fucked up now you know what it was they had to paint a jew's face on the football  and oiaj meant kick the jew in farmer language and the other team objected walt loved it 
[00:31:30]  can i say a quick thank you to jim norton sure it depends on why mr norton yeah you you had a caller  call you and was calling you out on something and you got really pissed at him and you said his name  was like dana or something and you said hey girl's name and you really got him upset my eight-year-old  came home because a fifth grader was picking on him and i asked him what his name was and he said  it was dana and i said you go up to him in a big crowd and go hey girl's name why don't you go pick  on someone else oh he did that everybody laughed at that kid and now nobody picks on my kid because 
[00:32:00]  they think he's the shit for coming up with such a cool line oh you're welcome fast forward a few  years and dana goes to school with a fucking semi automatic exactly wipes the school out wipes out  everybody it sounds great now but top of his list right it was lynn by the way not dana  remember that that guy's name was lynn lynn no we've done it with dana too really oh yeah we have  yeah we do with all the girl uh names girl name the guy hung up and oiaj was the thing okay oiaj 
[00:32:30]  but all these movies fall apart because something happens like you can't say oiaj anymore or something  well you look at they have to figure it out the original nutty professor with um jerry lewis  right uh it started wearing off remember he was buddy love sure and he would be singing  he would be singing about the black magic and then he would start and then it started going  started growing and he turned back into the professor and then he was buddy love get out of 
[00:33:00]  here you broad isn't you know smoking cigarettes and drinking and then he turned back into the  professor was he an ass as the professor oh he was a complete bumbling fool couldn't get a chick  didn't he have buck teeth and all that buddy love was just fucking out anything that moved yeah  and yeah he had the big buck teeth and he walked around just talking about his formulas  oh and you want to know the twist stevens was in that one she was the the babe that buddy love 
[00:33:30]  was like fucking just pounding was she hot yeah stevens was all right for the time let me go to ron  in arizona because he's got the twist in the gus movie because all the disney movies had some dumb  twist yeah go ahead ron yeah i'll be the twist was simply that the guy that held the ball was a  little guy that the one called hollered oish which meant get well they could be the opposing team  kidnapped him and so the donkey wouldn't kick the ball without him saying oish and this girl that had 
[00:34:00]  this little that liked the little kicker guy he got she got gus to kick the ball and and uh the guy  was all depressed because now he was of no use because gus would kick for anybody now ah did he  commit suicide at the end of the movie yeah is that stella fucking topless uh we got to go bro yeah  oh my god look at the long heavy tits uh she went topless way too late in her life  so who is this this is stella stella stevens nice big like big areola she's sexy travis's uh screen

[00:36:00]  uh waited for the word to kick the ball the bad guys put a different mule in what huh you have to  have bad guys in disney films they put a different mule in they couldn't fucking the bad guys were  shit were they the negroes or the jews in the disney movie which which was the bad guy what year was  gus 70 something maybe not though maybe that was like oh 76 yeah uh walt was dead already right 
[00:36:30]  all right dean in maine uh wants to talk about disney films uh dean uh you gotta remember that  kurt russell got all his uh his stardom from all the uh like the world's strongest man and  kurt russell was in all these movies yeah kurt russell was in a shitload of disney movies when  he was a little pretty much a little kid right yeah and then you got like the apple dumpling gang  now did kurt russell make the jump uh when he went and did used cars or was he still doing disney 
[00:37:00]  films after that when he finally made his his big his big jump right you know obviously he's had a lot  of decent movies escape from new york yeah yeah i was a biggie yeah yeah good movies yeah he was like  you're bringing back all kinds of memories of horrid memories of terrible fucking movies  uh opie's buddy here's a kevin from connecticut is saying opie's buddy ed asner starred in gus too 
[00:37:30]  he was uh in there huh can we play our great ed asner fucking interview have we played that in a  while maybe we can play it at the break stupid ed asner you're a destroyer  uh the bad guys uh anthony were spinner and crankcase oh were they like motor couch is that  true were they like bikers and motorheads i don't know were they the bad guys in gus 
[00:38:00]  sounds like a morning radio team spinner and uh crankcase yeah spinner and crankcase all morning  we have outrageous fucking names but we can't do shit because it's regular radio  i love that wow you guys have edgy names but you can't do shit  yeah we're action bloodbath and we're gonna make fart sounds until the boss tells us not to  can't even do fart sounds on regular radio immediately stop it we learned that the hard way 
[00:38:30]  god you can't right no when we're still on regular radio they even shut us down with fucking fart bits  the staple of comedy we weren't even allowed to do on regular radio what was the one it all started  with the fart what was the what was the one they they said no to we want to do something with farts  or the name farts or something i don't remember and they're like well you can't promote it is that  remember chisano yeah it was just it was just lunacy there was so many instances i can't even  remember anymore but it was like you can't promote it as a fart thing but you can have a fart noise in it 
[00:39:00]  it was some fucking embarrassing now i need to know because yeah but you do remember right  of course i do i just don't remember the specific bit we had a really good idea well a really good  idea how could it be a really good idea if it had a fart in it but it was something does anyone  remember we have all these guys that work here someone's got to remember uh i don't remember that  particular instance but uh i just searched some of the old uh dump sheets and i i do have a dump of a  fart here it says uh at one day at august 7th of 2008 okay hold on you know what this is a random 
[00:39:30]  dump sheet from when we were on regular radio yeah almost uh two years ago just read off the dumps  from that day this is what we had to deal with on a daily basis and this is just a random one we  didn't even find a good one there was a a fart sound that was dumped because uh it followed anthony  saying he would put his butt against your head and let one loose you were and then and then a fart  sound so the fart sound got yeah yeah we weren't allowed to do that and you wonder why it was 
[00:40:00]  difficult on terrestrial radio people like oh they couldn't do it on terrestrial radio bobby kelly just  getting dumped uh like crazy he said i accidentally finger popped my dog and then he said uh it was hot  dog pee and then a caller said douchebag and got dumped yep that was a completely company decision  for us because other other guys could say that on the road yep bob kelly said um shit which of course  we get dumped and then we have kike getting dumped jim norton kike two times jim norton kike bob kelly 
[00:40:30]  kike bob kelly pussy whipped anthony scumbag norton i just that wasn't a dump i was just calling you a  scumbag why i'm a good boy kike by the way derek remembers what that bit was it was called fart  trivia oh right so i guess uh we have made fart sounds to answer the question but i think people  had to do a real real fart before they could answer the question god and they wouldn't let us 
[00:41:00]  obviously not a fucking an award-winning bit idea but the point being when you're you're that  emasculated your balls are cut off that much like kike you don't have to run around saying kike  there was obviously a bit we were doing something or quoting something context of it yeah couldn't  you look at that i couldn't say fag couldn't use politically incorrect language yeah and you  wonder why we had trouble on regular radio it was it wasn't even yeah fcc rule rules that were being  dumped we had trouble creatively we still uh asian accent we still made happen there was just i just 
[00:41:30]  saw asian accent bob kelly that got dumped out of yeah that fucking and you know what chiasano i'm  sure was great with howard but by the time he had us he was just i think he didn't want to fight  what are we thinking that go back to that one what the fuck are we thinking uh caller shit norton  cunt bob kelly asshole bob kelly shit bob kelly fuck where where do you think we were and then an  email from mark shernoff says does bob have to curse so much these are hysterical i love it oh the 
[00:42:00]  tragedy that was regular radio it's fucking stinks they deserve everything they're getting over there  which is nothing they're getting nothing they had to turn every station into a jukebox everyone  and sports talk no sports talk is big right now oh that's shit jim jeffries erection jim jeffries  can't say erection this was taken out so other reference to erect penises could be left in 
[00:42:30]  tits seth rogan all right um c beep ck anthony so i did my beep thing and i went like with a beep in  between uh did it to their mouths do it in their mouths oh referring to douching  i'm pinching my helmet norton what does that even mean i'll pinch your helmet jim jeffrey this is  like two years ago look at us freaking out because it's like who gives a shit pinch the helmet you 
[00:43:00]  can't say those fucking lawyers continue to get their paychecks over there yeah but sort of when  they were the ones that completely ruined all right now you got me going all right let's go you know  the best part of this is yeah like you don't know what context these are in so you're just reading  things like i'm just saying faggot opie pussy she goes down on me uh audio of third eye blind song 
[00:43:30]  that was she goes down on me you can't you can't say that uh you can fit lots diarrhea diarrhea in  that cup that was seth green yeah and jack off when not many not many people knew seth green yet  shoot a guy in the dick they all know him now obviously uh yeah and the lawyers over there continue  to get their fucking paychecks we've been we've been long gone at this point and they continue to  get paychecks even though everyone knows they were the ones that ruined regular radio with their  stupid rules that the company allowed uh them to put in place the company's despicable the company's 
[00:44:00]  hired the lawyers hold on the company's hired the lawyers to keep everybody uh quote safe and they  just ruined everything and and they're still working today getting their big fucking paychecks  here's an opie line yeah probably a good fisting what's wrong with that i don't know it was taken  out i was i was imagining chiasano that day probably a good i like chiasano what am i doing  i thought he was gonna be a complete dick to us because the howard thing and he was he couldn't have 
[00:44:30]  been cooler what am i doing who chiasano he was you know what i like tom on a personal  i mean he was a tie guy you know he wore the tie every day but i didn't fight for us dude i like  tom on a personal i was surprised that he was as cool as he was to us as a guy yes but as as a as a  boss i think he was done arguing with upper management and i don't think he gave a shit  about us doing bits we wanted to do yeah i know he didn't like me so i guess i'm gonna think  twatto he didn't like you you don't think i know he didn't twatto colin quinn saying twatto

[00:59:30]  asked danny yesterday did they at least credit these guys and danny said not until later when  they were forced to i heard conflicting um uh uh stories yesterday a few people got a hold of me  and said that they did uh credit these guys a bit on their album originally i i don't know i don't  think not not on the original releases it wasn't it wasn't until after these uh the  all these people came forward were out and people were like hey what the fuck then they kind of went  back and i think not even all the zeppelin songs gave credit a few of them were changed to reflect 
[01:00:00]  some credit what was the writing credit though sometimes you see like you know i can't quit your  baby and then in parentheses they would say willie dixon parempities like i said now now you'll see  that now i wonder if that it was like that in the original that's a conflict of report i'm getting  someone's got to have i've heard both ways so i'm not i'm not positive any pictures of the  original album covers or whatever i'm just gotta be it's difficult to locate yeah uh play i can't  quit your baby by zeppelin for norton so i could get the nice reaction now this is a live version 
[01:00:30]  or some other version this is from the complete studio recordings i think this is live right yeah  it's not the album version yeah this is different all right so it sounds more like the willie dixon  version yeah look at jimmy's face it's good enough this is not the way this is not the way 
[01:01:00]  white guys relate sadness about our our women that's the way this is a black blues guy thing  yeah screw him you're right he'd have he'd have just like lost all the money anyway shooting craps  because he's irresponsible because he's black right shooting craps that's a trivial thing to do  of course it is losing all that huge led zeppelin type money ah he'd have left it in his shoe 
[01:01:30]  he would have been uh 94 today we can move on so when did he die the great willie dixon  94 i don't know he's got to be dead for a while now yeah it's not that big of a deal it's fine  i've just heard it both ways i'm trying to figure out what the real reason that the real thing is  here yeah i'm curious about that because i'll respect them more if they actually just put in  parentheses like you know who wrote the song all right that's fine yeah they're the best cover band  ever they really are great cover band yeah they took other people's songs and really made it their 
[01:02:00]  own we should have told uh robert plant that when we met him with his big fucking giant head  i mean he and i looked in love one of his locks was over my forehead i love that picture we looked  in love of his giant head yeah you were giddy your face just looked giddy dude me and hope watched  him warm up he literally we were from here to travis to robert plant it was just us and him and his  band in the room watching in that little xm room in dc yeah me and jimmy were creeped out because  you know robert plant likes to fucking show his cock and kind of sink to the broads and and 
[01:02:30]  and he was practicing so he's doing the same shit to me and jimmy and we're like this is really  fucking awkward his hips and all that shit his big giant hog and his big eyes were looking at me and  jimmy like what the fuck dude like robert plant remember that yes i do and i wish we could go back  so uncomfortable because they i mean it was nice of xm we were down in washington like hey you want to  watch him fucking uh uh practice before the big session they're doing down here i'm like yeah  sure i don't know where you were because you were down there too and all of a sudden it's just two 
[01:03:00]  seats in front of the band yeah who gets that opportunity unbelievable and then and the stuff he was  doing at the time was kind of cool i fell in love with that i took off but it was kind of cool the  stuff it was called the mighty rearranger was the solo and dude i after that i wish i had known the  material then because we didn't even watch him that i would have loved to have seen plant play  that because i fell in love with that record it's great yeah but uh all the all the weird sexy moves  that he was just doing it to you two idiots say we're dudes and b it's not 1974 anymore yeah robert 
[01:03:30]  robert see his ball bag halfway down to his knee right let me say hi to john in uh sacto california  you know where that is it sacramento yeah ob ob they give willie dixon credit right on the album  cover if you have the original album all right okay this is what we're arguing because dan is  saying no and i'm saying i heard this i'm not necessarily saying no i'm saying that that possibly  could have been but for most of their most of their songs that were borrowed let's say they did not 
[01:04:00]  give credit that might have been one of the songs they did give credit i'm trying to research it now but  it's uh you know i don't exactly have the original uh you know the original zeppelin one ep or lp  whatever to bust out so i can take a look at it yeah yeah you know who would know is uh the mad  scientist and plus the info the info that's on the you know that's on the the web now i mean i don't  know if if credit was added you know i don't know if what's you know if information's been updated  since or not i'm with you man i'm definitely with you i just i'm trying to figure it out myself 
[01:04:30]  because i've been a huge zeppelin fan uh we got to get lee abrams on the phone he would know  oh jesus he would know yeah but having to listen to him just go on and on about stuff  just to get an answer you don't like when he talks about radio formats on our show  hey what why are you doing that john this is a professional fucking show that's right  it's wrong with people everyone's saying get the comforter dry cleaned i'm going to but for the  sake of the radio i'm trying to make the pump up the story and say it's ruined jesus is it the same 
[01:05:00]  one you jerk off under yes i don't jerk off though really i thought it was the one you used to  pound your pud under while you watch nascar oh that's an old fucking i didn't watch nascar i had  to change the channel real fast yeah of course because you know the woman i was with at the time  was really surprised that she found me jerking off really what do you what do you think maybe if we  were having yeah exactly exactly figure it out in your own stupid head if we're not having sex you 
[01:05:30]  know i gotta get rid of the poison somehow you dummy please tell me that was the answer you gave  the poison no i i was embarrassed and covered up my pud and nascar was on and she walked out all  disgusted and then i lasted another fucking three years in a stupid relationship that i shouldn't  have been you didn't just come over and say why don't you fucking pop this in your fucking gums  hell fucking no your gums i was an idiot trying to take care of everybody yeah yeah just make 
[01:06:00]  everyone happy yeah much to your own fucking that's right it's always fun make sure everyone  else is happy around you that's all that's it all right uh well we'll we'll uh i don't know  danny's researching it i don't know i i just heard it uh told a couple different ways that's all you  ever get online we need an expert to really uh let us never this is about oh no sorry sorry that's 
[01:06:30]  okay i was just never you ever get online uh to research something and you're really digging into  it and you're trying to find you can't quite get it you're almost there and you just go fuck it  but why this isn't that important to me and then you just bail out see i thought you were going  somewhere else with that i was i was completely with you you you go you know what i need to know  the answer to this whatever and you're deep into research like you said and then all of a sudden  somehow it leads to maybe a little porn and then then you forget about the reason you started that 
[01:07:00]  happens too but there's other times where i'm looking for something i'm gonna and then i just  realize i go i go why why do i care and then just stop original led zeppelin album said traditional  arrangements what does that mean page well all right here's an original on them here's an original  uh but how do you know that's original dan uh it says uh it says it says 69 on the label but it's the  internet all right well it's on ebay so i would trust the original okay and what does it say 
[01:07:30]  um it says for you shook me which isn't a song that was in question but if they do credit says  dixon they do credit willie dixon on that on that particular one i sort of remember seeing this in  parentheses a lot of bands back then did that because they would they would you know i think  the stones did as well yeah dazed and confused yeah that's just page that was a blatant ripoff and it  says page who was that wait wait but i think page originally did in the yard birds true but uh 
[01:08:00]  and then the zeppelin technically was called the new yard birds but that other guy changed the name  that guy that we were talking about yesterday who uh the guy that's suing now homes oh what's his  face yeah jake homes right yeah he did it a lot sooner than uh oh right oh i'm sorry right that was  two years before this came out apparently so jake homes did dazed and confused then freaking page did it  with his yard birds and then and page starts up zeppelin and does another version of dazed and  confused i read yesterday that the yard birds actually opened for that guy back in the day and 
[01:08:30]  that's how uh oh boy how jimmy page heard dazed and confused yeah but you know that guy could suck a  dick because he was talking about mice and cats in the middle of his yeah yeah he felt like a mouse  wrote the lyrics and they're just going on that and then there was a cat yeah got all angry  like a mouse and a cat okay sucked he was terrible good you know what and fuck you  ian king from colorado who's your favorite driver to jack to so you you got him going with this nascar 
[01:09:00]  jerking off story dick trickle yeah that's my favorite dick trickle i like jerking off to dick trickle  drives anymore no i'm not sure can i off the record for one second just say by and large what  fucking babies most you conspiracy theorist guys are oh can i just say yeah what happened you've  been getting a lot of feedback from the interview not a couple not really not many yeah but the idea 
[01:09:30]  that you fucking little babies are upset with the we treated alex jones fucking like a  gentleman really well yeah that's what i'm confused about because i i got a lot of the  same tweets and i i went back and forth with one guy and i actually i actually settled a little beef  i had with this one guy i said dude we didn't go after the guy we weren't going to agree with him  or it was mostly jimmy obviously we weren't going to just agree with him it was a nice discussion it  was it was a nice debate but that's who these guys are but it was amazing to me they just they just 
[01:10:00]  heard jimmy beating up alex jones them up that just didn't happen you this i mean we could we  could play tape of jimmy and all of us beating up people on the show but that didn't happen with  alex i said to alex we gave him nothing but respect plugged his fucking show a bunch of times  plugged his website said uh that he was a compelling guy i just didn't agree with him and yeah i harped on  points he's coming off saying something i disagree of course i debated back and forth but i didn't insult  him i didn't talk over him or degrade him so you fucking little cunty baby conspiracy guys that's 
[01:10:30]  why i have no respect for you you don't want to debate and this is not about alex this is about the  people who are upset yeah yeah you can't just go hey look these guys had alex on alex says sure he  has controversial points of views he's going to be debated but these little fucking faggots want to  just be able to talk without any fucking any debate any debate is seen as aggression unless it's by  them right such this is why i can't fucking stomach most of you conspiracy guys it was a great back 
[01:11:00]  and forth uh interview whatever you want to call it yeah it really was and then jimmy and i were  talking on the way out and i said to jimmy i wanted i want to talk to the guy that's in between the two  yeah the conspiracy guys are way over here with their theories and then you got the government with  their official i want to i want to i want to get someone in the middle and because i mean alex jones  got me thinking but i'm not going to be you know believing all his far-fetched ideas some of them  seem far-fetched to me i'm going to do a lot of them i'm going to do a little more research but just 
[01:11:30]  hearing it at face value so then i'm thinking okay maybe some of this is true but i want to i want to  talk to the guy that's sort of in the middle that could rationalize both sides and and the and the  staying with one point or the talking about yeah we were talking about certain things and i felt he  was trying to get away from something that i felt it was a valid point instead of going hey  all right that's a valid point or yeah you know that's true he just kind of bypassed so i didn't  want to let him bypass it but that's part of debating we uh we covered a lot of ground a lot 
[01:12:00]  of ground i didn't feel like we were we're sticking on one subject too long i mean the good the jfk stuff  is the biggest conspiracy theory i should say i was gonna say one of but you're probably right the  biggest one ever and like that hasn't been debated between people over the years that's you know that's  what people do but these fucking little babies these they just they cannot handle a back and  forth that's why most of you can speak again i'm not saying all of you some of you are rational but  most of you just suck that's why ventura gets so fucking angry he's the same baby that most of 
[01:12:30]  you guys are he cannot take alex actually was a nice guy about it he didn't get upset he just went  back and forth he didn't get he's on you know he didn't get upset thank you for the service to your  country here's uh do you want to talk to dustin from texas or yeah i thought i might have been  talking about him i blocked him he said he was being a constant i blocked him hey hey what's up  dustin what's the matter dustin you don't like a little back and forth hey you want you want to  hear what really the real deal is jim yeah all right all right uh i didn't like some parts of the 
[01:13:00]  interview right right and and i was a little uncomfortable about it but then i set up all night  drinking vodka okay and i said some things i didn't really mean you know he told me this too  on twitter yesterday blaming it on the booze he goes he goes you know what i gotta say i was drinking  all night before i started tweeting you guys fair enough you motherfuckers he had a discipline i'm a 
[01:13:30]  huge fan of the show and i'm a huge fan of a huge alcoholic whenever i heard that alex gonna be on  your show man it was like the fucking dream team to me you know i i i like both of you and and then  whenever he got on i just felt like there was kind of like a condescending tone to the whole interview  to be completely honest i just didn't see it that way not at all dude you you misread us okay well  listen it really wasn't a big deal though but then i got drunk and what what the tweet amounted to  with a verb a verbal drunken what are you doing yeah you know i mean it it really wasn't as big 
[01:14:00]  a deal as my tweet made it sound all right i do apologize i know i should run you know what that's  cool i think i gotta unblock a lot of people now i gotta unblock a lot of people they probably don't  even based on booze the horrible tweets they said because they were fucked up also i mean dan i don't  know if he's there or not but he can verify us stay up all night drinking i i'm the one that was  chatting with you the other morning on facebook saying i was uh reading my monitor with one eye 
[01:14:30]  closed i don't know if danny remember that but no because he was doing the same thing  but no the con don't forget dustin the condescending alex was very much he's a very talkative guy and he  was very much kind of like you know and like i was trying to get points and he you know again that's  what he does but i thought we treated him very well considering how much i disagree on almost every  point i still like the guy and respected the guy and just didn't uh agree with him and dustin uh the  other side of this there's a guy we don't have to go to him uh nick in tennessee he's mad that we 
[01:15:00]  didn't uh go after alex jones more yeah a lot of people i mean that where we sit it's a no-win  situation sometimes yes yeah you got the big uh conspiracy fans out there thinking we disrespected  alex was i'm telling you i don't think we did at all and then you got other guys going why the fuck  then you beat him up yeah so you know can't win i didn't even realize you knew i existed or read  my tweets tell you the truth well i try i try to keep in touch with uh the people that listen to  the show what can i tell you dustin you know that i'm a huge fan of the show i'm always leaving 
[01:15:30]  positive comments everywhere i can and i love you guys i love alex too i'd like to see him on more  and just give him a chance man we did though we don't really what i know but we if you go to his  website you'll find out that he's not quite as tinfoil-y hat as he sounds can i ask you this  dustin tinfoil-y hat what do we have in uh common with uh alex jones do we have anything in common  with alex yeah yay oh now he's gonna go drink i didn't think he sounded tinfoil-y hat i thought 
[01:16:00]  that he was informed about like the banking situations when you listen to all that hey look  there was some interesting points even if it's not right or whether it is right at least he presents  it well i i didn't think he sounded like a lunatic or an idiot at all i just didn't agree and the jfk  i happen to have read a lot about so that's why i stayed on that he's got a lot of smart people that  are are in his camp a lot of people that are big alex jones fans joe rogan being one of them right  that was the main thing that convinced me to have mom is that joe rogan's a very intelligent guy 
[01:16:30]  uh he's also you know a drug addict like jimmy pointed out awkwardly the other day  i love joe he fucking mainline's fucking angel dust into his bag  it's the only vein that's still working on the but no no i'm wrong joe doesn't do too many drugs  no not at all let's see if i can find the text oh the uh the cell phone one yeah where's joe's text  i'll jump to the chase he tweeted his tell uh his cell phone yesterday oh shit why would he do that  yo dude this is it yo dude it's joe rogan i fucked up and twittered my number online so i had to get a new 
[01:17:00]  one and then he gives me his new cell and i laughed i'm like hey cool do you think you were  texting because that's how it happens yeah and he goes i thought i was sending doug benson a private  message and i said i said it could have been worse at least you didn't offer to suck his cock  they laughed to offer to suck mine with a difference let's go to kenny kenny hi gh well kenny says he 
[01:17:30]  works for jake holmes the guy that's suing zeppelin are you there kenny yeah i'm here let me push you  off speaker okay all right what do you got kenny you guys there we are kenny yes oh boy hey listen  no don't worry about it i listen i work for jake holmes he's a really cool guy i'm a contractor i  built a recording studio for him okay he's up in uh north say north of peak scale i don't want to  say where he lives all right why because because there'll be a beetle thing happening  it might be who knows he's really wild he's totally creative he he wrote a lot of stuff for a lot of 
[01:18:00]  big things he went into commercials and and things yeah we we went over his resume yeah what do you  like why why by the way did it take him so long to sue well he was trying to sue several times in the  past years and for whatever reason it could never go through they fought him back they fought him back  and he got beat down finally i think he got a lawyer who can really document what he did i mean there was a 
[01:18:30]  lot of copyright stuff that he had and i think that they were trying to say that his copyright wasn't  valid so they found out how to prove that his copyright is valid and now he has a totally legitimate  case to go after him he's been pitching about it for ever since i met him 10 years ago now now uh and  is it true the yardbirds uh had jake holmes on some of the tours yes he definitely wrote for the yard 
[01:19:00]  birds and he was i think the main writer for spirit oh he's the spirit guy i'm pretty sure he  so because they because uh zeppelin also ripped off going to california from a little song called  taurus by spirit yes yes he he told me about that one time and i didn't know i didn't really believe  him but i've seen him in action he really writes a lot of cool stuff no i mean we got we got the uh 
[01:19:30]  the original spirit song that sounds just like going uh not going to california uh stairway to  heaven yes stairway the big one stairway i mean if you wanted to hear it direct from him i could  call him and tell him to call you yeah we'd love to talk to him yeah we would actually how old is he  now he's uh probably in his early 50s mid 50s is that possible he's aren't the zeppelin guys in their 60s  yeah he should be he's in really good shape too he plays basketball he rides a bike he runs around 
[01:20:00]  all the time he's he's full of energy oh boy we're gonna get that fucking new story who said he was in  his mid 50s he would he would just on the radio with you guys forget it he'd be a blast so he wrote  these songs when he was like 10 years old yeah i know that's what he can't be in his mid 50s sir  yeah yeah i guess he's a little over 60s all right um yeah we'd love to have him on the show  maybe he could perform for us do his original fucking stairway to heaven song why don't you 
[01:20:30]  send me to somebody that i can give me why don't you shut the fuck up yes all right hold on man  we'll get uh jay colmes uh in studio to to talk about the zeppelin thing and then finally one more  on the zeppelin thing and then we're gonna move on andrew hey what's up boys uh there's a uh a dj  from philly i think his name is ed shockey and his whole like life's work is this whole zeppelin  thing and he's an authority on i think he's even written a book about it and uh he's been talking 
[01:21:00]  about it for years also all about how zeppelin uh stole that does he not like zeppelin no i think he  just you know it started as a hobby and then once he started figuring out like the whole catalog has  been lifted it kind of pissed him off so basically he can go through almost every song and tell you  oh wow all right well uh how do we get a hold of that guy how to fuck the wine off  you know what oh fuck the wine that's exactly what he should have said exactly what's his name so we 
[01:21:30]  can at least it ed shockey in philly yeah yeah all right andrew how to fuck the wine i know very  very good comeback by the way sir pat yourself on the back and have a few beers take the day off  assholes and then finally a middle uh middle guy as far as conspiracies go brian in san diego you  got someone we could talk to who's kind of in the middle of the whole thing uh yeah well there's a  couple people that are that are more informed about it like uh like peter joseph uh who does like 
[01:22:00]  this like guy shit and i was like that shit is kind of over the top and it's like filmmaking a little  nutty and stuff like that he's a really smart dude but i don't think he would do really great  radio if you guys could get the guy the head guy from uh wiki leaks i know you guys have heard of  it this guy is fucking he does a lot of pr he goes on all the all the like news shows stuff like that  if you can get him he'll give you good radio because um i came from like a school thought of  like science like when i when i when i grew up i was reading carl sagan stuff like that 
[01:22:30]  conspiracies were all complete bullshit and then i started looking into them and a lot of them  really are and i believe i watched alex alex's uh film uh end game last night and i thought it  would suck i mean because just because of what jimmy was saying a lot of stuff is is stated as fact  and he builds up a big well of evidence um for his case and ignores or downplays certain other parts  that that that don't support his case but um you know overall there's like uh there there are 
[01:23:00]  certain aspects of conspiracy theory especially the financial aspects of it uh that that are true  yeah it's much easier for me to it's much easier for me to believe the financial  aspect of because look people are disgusting but i think it's easier  to to at least it's easier to convince me that you can get a bunch of people in a room  who are figuring out a great way to steal yeah and people i think are much easier to sleep like 
[01:23:30]  bernie madoff stole a billion billion whatever the fuck he stole yeah and people are murderers and  scumbags but to me it's a lot easier to believe there's a conglomerate of secretive thieves  than a conglomerate of secretive murderers because i i just i don't know it's just easier for me to  swallow i know you're being naive man i don't think i am yeah all right one of the biggest ways they  control um the world is by setting up like big centralized banking systems and then going in  providing uh like aid to developing countries and then calling them on their loans and basically 
[01:24:00]  like robbing the people and things like that so yeah i'm sure that does exist it's probably sure it  does all right i'm gonna check out with uh wiki leaks yeah that guy's got uh i'll check that shit  out why not thank you uh who is this brian thank you brian brian and we got uh good news we uh we know  where ed shockey is uh josh in dc hey what's up guys um i know how you can get a hold of ed shockey  um yeah he's dead so maybe we can we can resurrect him and talk about let's that maybe we can get a 
[01:24:30]  ouija board and see what he knows about this how did it happen how did it happen probably someone in  the fucking zeppelin camp decided you want to talk about conspiracies why don't you shut the fuck up  we enjoy living in our in our castles  cast a spell on him that's right because they're warlocks  hit him with a piece of lead when he cracks his zeppelin into his house  can't happen chip chip's been in bad shape he had a mini stroke 
[01:25:00]  what he had a mini stroke what happened it's just hard to talk sometimes  you go around now with chip having had a mini stroke at home he had a mini stroke  you are an asshole why would you do that to chip because there's something about the way his right  cheek pops out when he talks now that really is annoying to his girlfriend oh okay chip wasn't 
[01:25:30]  annoying enough she was finding him endearing she started to like yeah yeah she started to like  chip so jimmy had to give him a mini stroke to take that away from her oh poor yeah she hated  rapping chip too yeah so chip can't rap anymore no is she afraid that chip's gonna kill her in the  middle of the night no chip doesn't scare her she edgar scares her edgar's not as bad as eugene  who's edgar's overly religious brother from the south always tells her she's a woman of loose virtue 
[01:26:00]  do we know eugene um he kind of looks like edgar except his mouth's a little crooked like  oh there it is you need to straighten yourself with the lord girl and she really fucking hates  him because he touches with his nails only when he holds her arms it's always his fingernails  fuck dude what i don't know how he fucking comes up with this shit yeah eugene is eugene is the hated one  now have you ever looked into all these voices to see if it might be connected to something else 
[01:26:30]  i know there's a bunch of people in my past what do you mean we had a neighbor named eugene who was  arrested i always touch people with his nails all right you know what fuck it let's take another  break yeah where my goddamn where my goddamn food got great news for everybody we got the trailer for  jersey shore season two oh good i want to hear the situations rap by the way you want to hear that too  is it out uh yeah i'm sure well we'll get sad it has to suck but it's good

[01:32:30]  percent rights though as far as decision making so she can't just take the kids and move to another  country you know there's some stuff in here though man what does she know because uh well let's read  through i wish my dad would have had that deal where uh i couldn't go over there and see him if he  had his chicks over oh really yeah you know a little something about that huh they were all like just  dad's whores and you go over there and they try to like uh be your new mommy yeah like not even be  mommy but try to like be your your pal and cool first like to get in good with dad i guess i guess 
[01:33:00]  dad was a good fuck so you know how many did he have oh there was like a shitload with shitload when  they first got divorced what a year he got like a little apartment more than that they wouldn't last  very long you know and uh he i'd go over like we'd go uh to whatever whatever he had me do on the  weekend sit in a bar and watch a game while he drank and then uh back to his apartment and then 
[01:33:30]  he'd hook up with his chippy because he's now a little drunk oh no chip it was a chippy  and that face he makes it priceless and and i and the chippy was just like kind of like oh hi  anthony and you're so funny and the and to try to and i would just i was get away from me so yeah  but i didn't tell the truth i didn't i didn't want to hear it from from dad's whore and today's  whore i wanted him to get back together with my mommy and these didn't look like your mommy did 
[01:34:00]  no that wasn't my mommy look like your mom no they look like fucking total blowjob chicks  yeah they were probably pissed we were over there it's like oh could you kids leave so i could get  some of that fucking you know you call me a cock you bring up a good point blowjob chicks do have a  look about yeah i gotta look about they really do yes they look like the incredible mr limpet  those big lips and they have no legs and their heads are craned back for maximum cock and ball 
[01:34:30]  suckage all right so would they have sex in there in the small apartment while you're over there no  not while i was there it's your time with daddy no i don't like leave you know i had to get picked  up or dropped off or whatever the fuck but they were always trying to be like this uh this one crazy  hippie chick took pictures of uh me and dawn and joe and uh and on the back of the picture she wrote  like what our personality was and what we'll do was she right on the fucking money jesus christ 
[01:35:00]  really yeah she was like oh joe you're gonna go so you're gonna go far in music and uh with your  guitar playing and anthony you're funny i could see you doing radio no i swear she said radio  yes the dumb whore she knew wow and then dawn i could see you whatever dawn does i don't even  know retail i could see you in retail and changing your job every three months i see you marrying people 
[01:35:30]  in the future yes i see rock and roll johnny race and that's not working out and i loved rock and roll  rock and roll you were a fan of rock and roll like johnny he was cool where is he he's fun he's  still rocking somewhere rocking and knocking around the island and shit he had a catchphrase rock and  roll rock and roll rock and roll so you know something about the yeah yeah that whole thing 
[01:36:00]  so that's probably why she wants uh no contact with the the other but let's go with not mommy let's go  through this because uh very uh very interesting the love cheat golfer has agreed to keep single women  away from his daughter sam three and son charlie one he can bring a new flame into their lives only  if he has married her so if he remarries then the kids could be around her but he has a long-term  girlfriend yeah in return former wife elan 30 gets the biggest payout ever seen in a celebrity divorce 
[01:36:30]  but she can never publicly speak out this is what's weird what does she know because we all know  a lot right yep so there's obviously the stuff we don't know you're right uh but she can never  publicly speak out over his flings with uh rachel you could tell reality star jamie grubbs porn queen  jocelyn james and up to 17 others she can't talk about any of it a tell-all book i was just gonna say  but if you're if you're getting 750 million what what is a tell-all book gonna bring in well just 
[01:37:00]  you know she'll be getting less than that like say she got 500 million and she wrote a tell-all book  with what his concern is that would ruin his image again like he's gonna take a while to rebuild  his marketability but he will rebuild it right and say in three or four years when he gets it rebuilt  and say he's divorced he fucked up and then all of a book comes out i got with how much he hurt her  right and the humiliation of all these texts i'm with you and details that we don't know but i think  much more her humiliation and and then tiger was with his father and the next day i saw him and he 
[01:37:30]  told me but he had been with her it would just be a disaster i like to think there's more  i like to think maybe it was more maybe he was banging that neighbor before  a little earlier than they were saying yeah that was maybe maybe that's it  tiger's main fear is her telling her story after he's rebuilt his reputation very good jimmy  sending him back to the gutter uh elan ended up with a with double the sum she originally sought 
[01:38:00]  after her lawyers proved tiger 34 was worth much more than the one billion dollars she thought  oh holy shit so if she's getting 750 million he's that's he's worth at least two or 1.5 she's  probably getting half or three she might be getting more than half if that's half i don't know i don't  know if it's half poor motherfucker i don't know if it's half i bet you he's worth a hell of a lot  more money you know yeah maybe it is half god jesus dude i mean and again on that level though it's 
[01:38:30]  like it sucks but his earning potential is still he's having a rough year man he's still making a  lot he hasn't won a tournament yet yeah true but he's got to win tournaments to continue making a lot  of money and he hasn't done that yet he really fucked up with this one though because this was not  just infidelity this was so much infidelity over the top and it was a public humiliation  that's humiliating when people see read the texts oh kevin in atlanta he might be on to something you 
[01:39:00]  know what we should take this call because this was in the paper today kevin go ahead buddy hey yeah  you guys are besides the girl the real thing that his lawyer wanted to quash was he didn't want  healing to come out and and bust him on using steroids because if that comes out then the pga  would take away all his championships all that prize money well that's what they're worried about  can can they take away all his uh all his i don't think they'll get the money but they could they  should be able to take i mean if they could i don't know what the rules are the pga and steroids 
[01:39:30]  and also he said he didn't use them so maybe he's worried if she said that it would be her word  against his they wouldn't prove that it's really suspicious because the paper's saying that he  admitted going to this particular doctor right and uh but he didn't use steroids he went there  because of an injury what do you know kevin i i only well what as far as i know is the doctor had  been busted uh giving steroids to other people and tiger says he went to this doctor for help but he 
[01:40:00]  didn't use any steroids which come on i mean look we don't know but you got to think he he used steroids  you're right i mean and i don't know and because i don't feel like getting sued by a guy that has a  lot of money he's probably less likely to be tied up he's probably trying to sign it back too so you're  right but i it i mean that's way too suspicious he goes to the guy that is now admitting that he  you know did the steroid thing do you think he'll be able to rebuild his image like mike vick or is it  over mike vick's image is not rebuilt i mean he's just maintaining well there's there's a story about 
[01:40:30]  mike vick he was at a party for what it was his 30th birthday party and right after supposedly right  after he left there was a shooting that was his fault though no i know now they're saying he probably  left in time he wasn't there but he was there but i'll tell you what happened michael there he was a  he's having a birthday party and one of the guys he knew from the dog fighting day showed up and he's  not supposed to associate with him anymore and i think the nfl contract he's not supposed to so he  they said to the guy you have to leave and the guy was being very vocal and being a dick and like 
[01:41:00]  slap so much play you know whatever course he was but somebody i'm sure it was about respect and  then somebody they don't know who's shot though but i don't think i didn't do it michael vick  they think they think it's his brother and the guy who was shot is one of the guys that rolled over  on him so that's why they're looking into it oh what is michael vick doing he got the all right  what's he doing he's skated what he's doing he's doing i don't think it was him i know but it's 
[01:41:30]  it's too close i have never been involved with a shooting that's true and has a million guns he's  never been involved with a shooting knock what is he doing stay clean oh uh okay so the the reputation  possibly the steroid thing okay uh the price of the huge sum is her silence no interviews no tell  all books no tv appearances about this for the rest of her life wow even if tiger dies first or she'll 
[01:42:00]  lose the lot holy shit if he's dead she can't even talk about him dude for 750 million who gives a  shit exactly what is it to tell unless unless he flies shit like unless there's something worth  telling me tiger can fly i want to tell people you can fly you can't no never say it maybe there's  some kind of cuckold uh incident they had oh dude it would not surprise me i'm not just saying that  because i've been cuckolded twice in the last week believe me i'm quite sure no i got golden uh it 
[01:42:30]  might be something like that dude it really might be uh okay you never know elon keeps their main home  and uh god i don't understand the women that get to keep the main home go take the money i i just  gave you go fucking get your own stupid house you didn't see her fucking play golf over the years  she plays great the main home she gets so it's the main home in uh windermere florida and a nearby 
[01:43:00]  property jointly worth three million plus an apartment in stockholm and her island farmhouse nearby  for home she gets tiger gets a 61 million dollar estate in jupiter island florida where they were  building a brand new mansion there so he gets okay so he gets that i mean three 61 million dollar house  well she only got the three million dollar house i say only because that's nothing compared to the  61 million dollar house of course in the bathroom what is it for the risk he will also keep their  two million dollar apartment in la that that she doesn't want that little piece of shit there's 
[01:43:30]  fucking closet there's poison all over that she's like you know what keep the la place  where you brought your whores uh she gets sole physical custody of the kids uh and you said yeah  she um tiger shares in the decision about their future oh man oh and elon will not be able to  permanently locate them to her native uh sweden she can't take them uh take the kids over there 
[01:44:00]  that's gotta hurt her because that's where she's from and that's where she's got her family she can  take them there but she can't live there she can't live there so wow wait he keeps a 61 million  there is something that he doesn't want her saying way past the image but that money there's there's  there's something i think that you might everything's out there i i hear like yeah exactly she could ruin  him financially again though like it might be a bad embarrassment but i also think she could have a 
[01:44:30]  multi-hundred million dollar impact on him financially if his image let's say three or four years people  have forgotten and all of a sudden she's headline news again he might start losing sponsors he just  doesn't want to start over this is also about him just going fuck it let me move on oh well unless  there's bisexuality or fucking homosexual who knows the rest of his life that is too much rest of his  life because i mean he could put in there you can't write a book for at least 10 years he gave and 
[01:45:00]  that would be the end of his career basically he gave into everything he just said fuck it he threw his  hands up and like just give it good wow wow wow yeah tiger's doctor was in canada which is sketchy  tiger was probably using hgh yeah that's there's some yeah why would he go to canada there's suspicion  there for a doctor uh 700 all those canadians are nothing but drug addicts 50 million dollars  all their drugs wow someone else is saying the doctor's legit uh all right do you know how much even 
[01:45:30]  though he fucked up on ilan really bad do you know how much he must hate her stupid swedish face  oh yeah and a dumb blonde hair probably wants to shove a grapefruit right in that face dude  yeah why yeah seven me a drink hundred and fifty million you know what before we go back to the  funny god damn something has to be mentioned today there is a story in the fucking paper  there was a guy i hate new york state i really do do you know as you said that i was so worried 
[01:46:00]  something else was about to fly out of your mouth i don't know why i thought that oh really it was  just it not that it would make sense but just a momentary would it make sense if somebody else said  it in this studio of course it would of course it would just make sure it'd be more shocking if it  came for me is what jimmy's saying i fucking hate new york state i really do i've been obsessed with this  death penalty in new york state now uh pataki right at let's go back pataki somewhere in the 
[01:46:30]  90s i believe brought back the death penalty for new york state what year do we know mid 90s maybe  yeah it was like right after he was uh elected so let's say 95 i mean we could get the exact date  pretty easily but let's say 95 so it's been about 15 years we haven't killed one fucking asshole  no no not a one and there was a there was a uh a guy who killed two fucking cops animal an animal 
[01:47:00]  absolutely right staten island two cops to the back of the head he executed two cops executed him  and he was uh given the death penalty federal too and you know at the fucking in court so it was a  federal death penalty yeah yeah wow all right so so it it it went beyond just beyond new york state  okay but i still fucking hate new york state in court he stuck his tongue out at the the widows  the victim's family yeah yeah what a great gentleman and this is what you you get as uh as uh you know 
[01:47:30]  the victim's family they overruled it and this guy will not be uh put to death and he's not on death  row anymore no no they they found some type of bullshit what's the legal loophole that the  prosecution did this or that is it it's bullshit that in a trial there are so many details that no  matter what the fuck happens you're going to be able to come up with something that one side of 
[01:48:00]  the other did that uh you could talk a judge into saying that it was inappropriate for the trial  it's unbelievable uh and by the way both of these detectives were black the perp black also so this  is a uh an issue that i mean i don't see why reverend al isn't all over this one uh why would he be  well the two only two cops shot he doesn't care about two cops being shot exactly and and it it even  transcends the race thing because they were both black officers the uh perp is just a disgusting 
[01:48:30]  piece of shit yeah he really is and um where's where's the outrage well here's one of the sharptons  in a weird position and so is jesse because the perp is black so they cannot say anything about that  however the victims are black so they kind of want to say something about that  but the victims are cops which means nothing to sharpton and jackson so they don't have to say  anything about that you know how about you base it on just what happened and the fact that two 
[01:49:00]  detectives were executed by this piece of shit he really is a bug and yeah he'd been in trouble  before of course no one starts off murdering two detectives exactly that's never somebody's first  crime he stole candy and then he shot two cops he didn't do anything uh sir i beg for leniency  um yeah just another awful case why why isn't he uh on death row why isn't he just being put to 
[01:49:30]  death here here uh just the first couple paragraphs a stunning manhattan federal appeal appeals court  ruling yesterday overturned the death sentence for a vicious cop killer and gave him a second chance to  plead with jurors to spare his life plead like you know like the cops probably were pleading when they  realized holy shit this fucking animal is going to kill us and we have heads and we have families  yeah uh the split decision sparked outrage from nypd officials and the widows of hero detectives 
[01:50:00]  uh rodney andrews and james nemerin who were shot execution style by ronnell wilson during a 2003  undercover gun buy and bust operation on staten island that was seven years ago seven years ago already  fuck so so cold blood it was wilson that he brazenly stuck out his tongue this is what jimmy  was talking about to taunt the family members of his victims during his sentencing and and and they  decided that he shouldn't be put to death i mean what the what the fuck well he's done it's only it 
[01:50:30]  doesn't mean he will not get the death penalty there was something that happened during the process  of his getting the death penalty that went a little awry and so they have to give it to him again  all right give it to him again then it's but they're not saying the evidence was no good  they're not saying that he wasn't read his rights or any bullshit like that he's not getting a new  trial i think he's only getting a new shot to plead well whatever death whatever he's in jail  forever ridiculous in jail forever though i mean when we were talking with billy hayes yesterday 
[01:51:00]  he even said in a turkish fucking prison becomes he was able to realize this is my life i go day to  day the sun comes up the sun goes down you live your life you become that becomes your life it's not  like every day you're going oh my god i'm in prison oh my god if you just become like ah you know this is  now my life let me summarize it if you're allowed to jerk off you're not suffering yeah yeah jerk off 
[01:51:30]  watch tv but i'm just saying if you yeah yeah if you could have any type of pleasure in your life  you're not suffering everyone becomes they everyone we're very adaptable as far as getting used to our  surroundings whether it's uh uh the great outdoors or prison i was gonna say or serious xm yes exactly  we've adapted yes we've adapted we hate half these fucking you're able to but you are able to just  adapt it becomes your life when they're strapping you to a fucking gurney if you don't want to die 
[01:52:00]  you're not adapting right then and there to go uh and resigning yourself to the fact correct there's  going to be fear there's going to be you know and then you're just going to be gone which is good  this guy should not be uh a member of society even if he's locked up so you got you got the the  widows they're crying they're shaking in court they can't believe this they feel like they're reliving the  whole thing again they thought they didn't have to deal with this piece of shit anymore 
[01:52:30]  well yeah so wow yeah fucking just this state's a joke really is we got a fucking blind governor  that couldn't even see the bills he was signing yesterday did you see that picture your tweet was  very funny it looks exhausting because that's exactly what it does it looks tiring are you following  me now i'm following you i read you i don't follow you i read you i actually go to you  every day i read you i do you're in funny people you and ann are in funny peeps i don't know what 
[01:53:00]  that means you gotta do the lists a little start your lists but the lists qualify as following into  the same thing i don't even know what that means it's just easier because i follow a lot of people  but then you break it down a list so i got funny peeps it's all my uh comedy friends and then you click  on the list and then it's only my comedy friends and their tweets it's perfect you you gotta look  into lists if you're into twitter it's a great way to organize your shit i follow it's like putting  it in folders like gant was talking about yesterday yeah i follow 13 people i think uh it looks like 
[01:53:30]  he's going down on the bill a lot of people made cocaine references oh it also looks like he's doing  a line it's a tweet i did yesterday so you might have to go down a little bit if you follow me on op  radio but i feel bad for him look at his signature it's governor patterson his nose is actually touching  the paper as he signs a bill for new york state and then uh the paper uh says he has to do this  6 899 times he's got to sign 6 899 of these this way and i wrote yeah it looks exhausting his name 
[01:54:00]  looks like looks like you're just learning to write in cursive what happened they were trying to kick  him out of office and we they they got tired even they got tired of it which which proves our point  if these stupid radio companies would just hang in there and everyone just goes away eventually they  wanted to get rid of the governor of new york and and and and he said no i'm not leaving half his  staff left really important people excuse me worked side by side with him left and all of a sudden he's 
[01:54:30]  still the governor now he's gonna write out his term why is he gonna fucking stamp  just stamp your name like a caesar used to do yeah it's humiliating it really is that he's  why would he allow like that someone to photograph him signing a bill like what an asshole he looks  like you know that looks like he's fucking doing a line off the bill yeah yeah the governor's an idiot  get your fucking face out of the paper unbelievable what are you doing can't you do it by feel 
[01:55:00]  braille yes you should be signing it in braille you know what it is he's priced to sign with a  bunch of different pens like the president there's no way like no i'm not doing it that way there's no  way he could sign that fucking horribly how about you put have someone put your hand there like this  okay where is it right here good jim norton there we go that was better than fucking old nose on the  table so they still teach the kids penmanship in school i remember when you had to start writing 
[01:55:30]  in script i don't write it i still do block print i'm getting old and i still do the only thing i  could write in script is my last name aside from i could barely even write my first name in script i  think aside from their uh your name signing your name i think it's a dying fucking has to be thing  that's cursive yeah cursive that looks like script you're you're right when you first started  learning how to write in script that's exactly that's what it looks like that's a name that  should be underneath a fucking paper plate with that macaroni glued to it and spray painted gold 
[01:56:00]  and you brought your name on it and put on the fridge he looks like he's fucking making a model  airplane or a ship he's putting a ship in a bottle but he's doing it wrong putting a bottle in a ship  because he's blind let's go to sean north carolina that doesn't agree with us as far as the cop  killer yes he does come on sean what do you got come on what do you got in this well even though  he's been taken off death row i still think he's being made to be punished you know even though you 
[01:56:30]  know he's still in prison you know okay well are you an anti-death penalty guy no i'm just saying you  know july 2nd and 3rd he's not gonna get to see jimmy norton at the mercada yes you're right all right  that was a good one very good damn he's not see i didn't jump all over that one i actually didn't  see that one coming where's sam jersey shore is about to start up oh my god sam knows a little bit  about this dumb pop culture i cannot wait that show is i was a fan of the first one because it

[02:00:00]  is radio playing this no why not oh really yeah it hasn't gotten a huge buzz knock on shade 45's door  and ask if they're playing this situation yeah certainly hasn't why don't we get along with  those guys what did we do wrong with them i get along with them i don't know what's wrong with them  you got you know a little i got what you know yeah i'm just friends with you got a couple drops 
[02:00:30]  of black yeah oh they know that they they smell it they don't like that we did mary and barry that  time huh oh yeah i don't give a fuck oh yeah i don't have any problem with those guys mary and barry  was a great moment for our fucking show great moment i don't think they dislike us why do we think  they don't like us oh we don't we don't have an interaction because i'm a racist yeah who kid  loves you guys so i don't think i like the hook who kid was great  but the situation has certainly not crossed over to 
[02:01:00]  which voice is he well that's fat man scoop going let's go huh i thought it was his hype man kind of  like flavor flavors for pete no that's fat man scoop fat man here we go yes i'm scoop carlisi  fat man yeah likes calm 
[02:01:30]  no this is great what happened there's still more actually really you cut it off a little uh  yeah a little early what happened you can't play it wow the thing was just thrown across the room  it's sam if you wanted to hear the rest do we have a video is there like a video there's no music  video why it's gotta be i'm sure it's in production i bet they debut it on the show 
[02:02:00]  see i would watch that uh dane would you this better be good because we're talking about jersey  shore and you're interrupting us we're talking about uh season two of jersey shore we got we got  the uh the official trailer and we can't believe that uh we have to deal with this still this jersey  shore crap you know it's weird i just woke up i just had a dream that i murdered the entire cast 
[02:02:30]  at knife point we were saying that and well and said it and we all agree the best moment was when  snooki got punched in the face belted in the fucking her dumb face i mean you know something  about comedy that's that's just pure comedy when she got built beautiful yeah yeah that was um  that was uh the first season right where the guy in the bar like smacked her around or something  yeah you smack around he fucking wound up and belted her in the face she went flying it was 
[02:03:00]  a cold cock is what yeah oh yeah great the best part they showed it on special effect though to give  it didn't they add like a boy make it fun some cartoon sound make it fun right uh but then mtv they  showed the clip a million times but then when it was time to show the episode there they said look we  can't show this this is just too outrageous meanwhile they showed it a thousand times that's mtv for you  they you know they they're highbrow they sure yeah they don't want to show that uh what do the kids  think right kids screw the kids now dame what that literally what have you been up to my friend i 
[02:03:30]  follow you on twitter you're doing all sorts of stuff man are you did you go to the uh um the nba  finals yes i did in fact you know what i did this stupid thing where i was like i'm going to  i'm just going to make a pilgrimage and follow basketball around i'm just going to follow the  celtics for the next several weeks and you know hopefully we'll bring it in and it'll be a big win  and you know screw the lakers and so it was like this tremendous momentum i'd never dedicated that much 
[02:04:00]  time to anything outside of comedy except like i'm just going to go to these games and i want to  see us win it i'm not going to think about anything else and of course when you do that and you become  so invested that it's beyond heartbreaking it's it's dumb you feel like an idiot by the end of it  yeah and you were going back and forth between boston and la well the celtics had a good run man 
[02:04:30]  i mean but that doesn't matter at all if you're a sports fan but still to come that close to come  within minutes to lose it the way we did by just you know basically giving them the game when the  lakers win and they go we don't even know how we did this you don't want to hear that no it was a  great game seven though it really was yeah you know i guess it was one for the fucking ages or  whatever we're supposed to say but still it's uh it was it sucked to lose like that after you know 
[02:05:00]  spending time money effort energy and rooting and uh forget it now dane uh because we haven't  talked to you while i'm catching up a little bit so uh don't mind me here american idol finale you  had that fine song going and then that and then you had a kanye west moment with one of the idiots  i you know what it was you know in comedy i'm sure you guys know it's like the the golden rule of  comedy is a stand-up the one thing you never do you never hand the mic to a heckler  right never give the mic to a heckler so the day of the show producers are like hey we have a we 
[02:05:30]  have a great unthought through idea unthought through one one idea we have is why don't we we  flew in some of these you know uh has been you know knockoff crazies why don't we bring up up on  stage with you to sing the final part i'm like i literally am like all right listen yes just keep 
[02:06:00]  them away from me right just you know keep them like you know because i know they're they're you  know they're cuckoo and they're going to do whatever they can do to try to oh no no you know what  they're great people they're cool they they know their place in life it's it's going to be fine and  of course uh you know right at the very last line of the song one of the uh one of the uh you know  dudes went crazy and grabbed the mic and i didn't even know what he said i i have no clue he he just 
[02:06:30]  started ranting about politics or something yeah he wanted uh simon's job or something of course he  did yeah it was a dumb moment that he was going for and uh yeah and you know what a moment that for  me i mean granted given the night and given like the finale and simon and and like i knew that  nobody would it's like do the song hopefully it'll be entertaining make simon laugh and i'm out i knew  it wasn't going to be anything people were uh talking about around the water cooler the next day 
[02:07:00]  necessarily and yet it it actually ended up being the best thing because then everybody was talking  about it right i i saw i read somewhere that you were really close to just punching the guy  well if the mic the mic almost hit my mouth when he pulled it out of the mic stand  and yes if the if that had cracked me in the mouth you know there's that there's that moment where  you're like i i i know i would have snapped uh and granted i'm i'm glad i didn't because i learned 
[02:07:30]  after that he was also homosexual that would have probably turned into some kind of uh wow yeah that  would have turned into like a uh you want me to say it fag bashing go ahead yeah yeah yeah you know  how the media will moments would jump on something like that of course but man how great would have  been to see dane cook uh during the american idol finale just well and punch somebody i said it  would have turned into american beatdown if i got hit up in the face yeah jimmy you saw this  yeah we talked about it the next day because uh a lot of people were confused like oh that was a 
[02:08:00]  weird setup moment and i i remember reading on your twitter how pissed you were when you were so  i'm like it wasn't set up he didn't have anything to do with this just the attention whore grabbing  the mic that's so annoying yeah yeah but i i invited it i literally invited the devil into my home  you know i had it coming to me now norton you're in uh ac uh this weekend too right yes i'm hoping they  will go see you one night and me the next let's do this let's not let's let's just switch and show 
[02:08:30]  up for each other's headlining gigs how great would that damn how great would it be i'll tell you what  happened there'd be some very happy people at the borgata and a riot at whatever hotel dain is at  dain uh dain's at uh trump taj mahal the enormous dome yeah right uh one show friday one show saturday  for for dain cook at trump taj mahal hey do do you are you are you a ufc fan dain you know what i'm 
[02:09:00]  slightly i'm trying to get into it because there's show i'm trying to find a place in ac after the  saturday show because the fun the lesnar carwin fight is saturday in vegas why isn't there more of  a buzz on this fight well there probably is we just haven't had anybody in no it just hasn't been  all over it hasn't been on our radar this week really i don't i don't feel it anyway i mean this is a  massive fight this is the biggest fight in ufc i think ever but uh i want to find a place in ac to  watch that fucking fight and i can't find anywhere is your friday show later than your saturday show 
[02:09:30]  mine is yeah i think the friday shows at like well nine o'clock or something like that yeah nine and  then saturday eight o'clock yeah i think i'm ten and eight because they want to give people time to  get into ac it's a holiday weekend or sure or whatever how do you do on walk up i mean i'm hoping  because i'm not sold out but i'm i'm close but i'm not sold so i'm hoping that they do some kind of  walk up i mean do you usually get a lot of people walking up yeah especially this weekend it's a it's  a huge walk up weekend so is it okay you'll see a big uh a big bump you'll see a spike in numbers 
[02:10:00]  dude all those awful fucking things that people throw at you really yeah big wraparound sales from  tuesday to wednesday and no wraparound sales that's the peak calls if peter's my my agent probably made  that up yeah you know what they always try to make you do these little uh you know weird uh promo  things like day of where it's like dame you know would you mind wearing a sash around  but this is the nerve i have that i'm actually talking to dame like like we're just two people 
[02:10:30]  competing for the same amount of people here's the reality he needs to go right now from probably  14 000 to 16 000 people he probably has another 2 000 to sell out of 16 000 i just want to go from  50 to 80 people i just want 80 people in the fucking room hold on one second i just added a third show  oh don't don't tell me that i've never seen i've never seen yeah go ahead officially um it's as of 
[02:11:00]  this morning i've realized because i'm i'm like tech guy you know we love our gadgets norton i know you  get the new iphone i do yeah i i hate i officially hate it i'm sick of it i think i'm tapped out on  on technology and i'll tell you why because this morning i dropped it and the sound of fear that came  out of me i put my foot up to try to break its fall yeah my newborn baby and what i realized was 
[02:11:30]  like a couple days ago somebody's like oh can i can i hold it and it was the first thing that i ever  like did not want to i didn't want to hand it to somebody else because i'm so afraid of somebody  hurting it guys right you know what i mean they describe it now it's like it's a piece of art you  know it's like and i don't i don't want to hold a fucking piece i first of all i'm polishing it like  the orloff diamond getting the grease off of it yeah my my buddy wants to take a picture with it 
[02:12:00]  i'm like it's like you want some kind of collateral because you you truly feel like you're handing the  mona lisa to somebody and i and i don't like that anymore i like it to be a little you know a little  banged up and a little uh a little plastic that's funny i've never used the mona lisa to photograph  my cock and send it to somebody who i think is 18. dude i want to get an ipad i fuck apple man i  ordered an ipad probably three weeks ago and i know there's a backorder for them and a fucking  thing still hasn't come yet it's so irritating yeah you know what i i shouldn't be thinking so much 
[02:12:30]  about fucking technology and how to protect it that's the thing it's like it's like oh no you  gotta get the case and i'm like yeah no no i want to i want to get it in like a velvet box that's  sealed that's glass that only i know the code to i should not care so much about protecting  something that's in my fucking pocket isn't it amazing how quickly your foot can get under  something you drop it really is it amazes me you don't think about it you don't go wow that's 
[02:13:00]  falling i better get my foot under there just automatically and then you feel like really  like my reflexes are fucking cranking today yeah but i'm slipping a disc to save a phone  it's it's bad when you lose your phone it's your whole life is on that goddamn thing that's what  it is every every bit of your life is on there i was talking to danny yesterday i'm just like you  know something you can't just put this down for more than a few minutes you're constantly picking 
[02:13:30]  that iphone up and just like looking at something fucking around with something grabbing a new app i i put  the phone down two minutes later it's back in my hand again yeah yeah and another thing that really  sucks that people don't don't realize what they're doing to themselves is like i'm i'm cleaning out my  office the other day i found an old box of photos i sit indian style on the floor i you know me and my  sister pass the mark okay then i found a hard drive that i had from two years ago that i know has 
[02:14:00]  pictures on it i can't fucking access it because i don't have a firewire 400 for it anymore  so your old shit is gone it's gone you're never going to be you go into radio shack you go do you  guys have firewire 400 they're like yeah it's right by the tubes you're done there's no box of old 
[02:14:30]  photos anymore to find there's a hard drive that you're just going to end up tossing because you  don't have the the right fucking uh wires to plug in do you know this is how paranoid i am about  stuff i just got a safe deposit box because i want to put hard drives in it that have fucking  photos on them pornography no how much was it jerk off in the bank no i want to uh but yeah you're  right man the older the older hard drives and stuff it's like and plus if it crashes you lose  everything yeah everything you have to have a um a backup of your backup you really do you have to 
[02:15:00]  have a a main like one terabyte hard drive that backs up your smaller because i broke a hard drive  once and then to get that repaired was like a couple of grand and then the guy couldn't get the  information off and he goes well you're backup of the backup right i'm like no backup this was  yeah i hope jimmy's bank burns down it probably i bet you as soon as i put it in it will the  fucking there's something you do my hard drive will spark and fucking burn the place down hey look 
[02:15:30]  man uh you know you want to back but then again a fire would ruin photos too though so it's like  all those pictures you found one good fire would fucking wipe out an entire generation of memories too  yeah you got to get one of those fireproof safes i just said something that added how did i add  absolutely nothing to a discussion about photos i really did i had nothing yeah yeah yeah i have  no problem with what you just said thanks it was a statement and by the way i hate when people do  like you danger drop it something stop it with your foot and people go yeah no i did that literally  last night i have a flip cam which is worth less than 200 and i'm going to put it in my usb and i 
[02:16:00]  dropped it and i stuck my foot out to stop it and the usb part slammed on my foot but it didn't break  and there might have been video of somebody getting his dick sucked but that was that was more  important than my fucking football of course i will tell you my favorite uh tech moment in my  life and of course has to do with bobby kelly i always have to have a bobby story 1993 bobby was  already like when i first met him uh bobby was already like on the cusp but whatever the next thing 
[02:16:30]  was in technology but you know it's like bobby had a commodore 64 souped up something right yeah so bobby  shows up at uh we're at this gig we're at a uh a gig in saugus massachusetts we're all standing in  this big parking lot we're at a comedy group at the time and bobby pulls up and he does this thing  where he sits in his car right next to us looking at something to make us all go like what is what  is that thing bobby's holding what's it what's it and we know he's doing it for show just like 
[02:17:00]  he gets out he's holding you remember this thing was called the wizard the wizard no okay the wizard  was like uh what the iphone was now in 93 it was just really what it was it was like a souped up  portable uh you know it's like a calculator with uh you know you could put like your addresses in it  almost like a palm like the first palm or something like that yeah and this is no no lie no embellishment 
[02:17:30]  bobby gets out and he runs up to us with this thing it's you know it's the size of a kindle but  at that time it's portable yeah and he goes check this out dude check it out dude it's the it's the  wizard and we're like whoa he opens it up and he's he's hopping he's bouncing he's like did sing  did fucking now i get oh dude i got my entire address book i got okay he's scrolling through  he closes it and this is exactly what he screams he's he screams i got the wizard and he throws it in 
[02:18:00]  the air he throws it like a frisbee in the air and like like 200 feet in the air and then he  this is a skinny bobby kelly and then he realizes that he's thrown his brand new device in the air  and then he runs across the parking lot and catches his own throw what an ass really who's  fucking mary tyler moore opening the show but this is what bothers me about bob when he talks 
[02:18:30]  about something it's like he'll say something like he was trying to explain the uh the ipad to  me when i when he first got he's like dude it's fucking amazing you sit down you got your cup of  coffee you sit outside you got the patio you can look at the paper you could read the i'm like how  many things are you gonna list stop naming things like you don't have to dress up the entire scene  for me you know you're not fucking producing a film i get it tie my sneakers i'm sitting down i'm  fucking yeah bob does that when he realizes he's losing you he'll actually just keep listing shit 
[02:19:00]  hoping that one connects with you dude you sit on the patio nothing you know you know it's kind of  sunny you got your awning up oh all right awning awning got it stop listing shit brings it back in  bobby's uh big sell on technology jim and i know you've heard him do this is when he goes uh uh he to  prove the convenience of use it always ends with after you did it the awning and then boom throw  it in your bag dude oh dude every time really every time that motherfucker says throw it in your bag 
[02:19:30]  dude that to him is the selling point for anything they're checklets boom you chew them you throw them  in your bag he's out of your dude good call oh that's a good one you throw it in your bag dude  think a t-shirt it's always a comic book fight description sound like pow throw it in your bag  pow whap zings zam boom dude throw it in your bag is exactly what he says because bob thinks he lives  in the airport like it's a fucking hertz commercial it's like i know you fly a lot bro but take a 
[02:20:00]  laptop he's like boom you throw it in your bag dude you get right in a fucking plane god damn it he does  say that son of a bitch um when are you flying in that's great uh i'm leaving in like a couple  of hours i'm going through uh philly i'm gonna do some radio stuff in there and then friday morning  oh yeah yeah i'm doing some uh acs oh so you're actually flying commercial yes  does this suck flying commercial i've never flown private in my life 
[02:20:30]  you know what once you have flown private like i did for that tour it's it's tough man it's hard  to go back but um but no you know it's like you can't that's also crazy to think you could afford to  right to do that i did that old school bon jovi thing where it's like i made promoters like think  the next promoter was taking care of me more than last and everybody should pay it forward  great deals on the pay it forward for a private jet that's wonderful you get scared flying private 
[02:21:00]  about maintenance and stuff like that that would scare me or were you totally confident that they  were good i yeah i was pretty confident you know even though some of the when they're you know de-icing  a small plane like that right you watch the guys de-icing you think they're really going to care  about their job they're going to be looking at every nook and cranny of the plane and those guys are  basically out there just yammering between each other like looking at looking at a book or something  like you're you're literally staring at the window like lithgow in twilight zone the movie  like get right there get that chunk of ice right there horrified but tell them if you ever think 
[02:21:30]  they missed something fucking tell them man always tell them jimmy's got to be the most annoying guy  on the plane i had a u.s he missed a spot dude i had a u.s air flight held up one time because they  you know the metal tape they put on the wing and a piece of it was flopped up and i told the  flight attendant i'm she's like oh it's not i'm like i want the pilot to see that and she went and  got the pilot and he looked at it and he called maintenance and they repaired it so we were delayed  by about a half hour did he say uh thank you captain norton for uh pointing that out i don't know 
[02:22:00]  like to fly the fucking plane and i'll do some jokes he didn't say that no he just nobody recognized  me he just went in i was a younger guy going to do atlanta not particularly well known as now  and uh they fixed it and i was in the emergency room i was in coach so it shows you how many years  ago it was coach but the uh the guy next to me got annoyed he was like you know huffing and puffing  and uh i normally wouldn't confront a stranger like but i'm like do you want to fly with the fucking  tape i threw in fucking do you want to fly with the tape coming up on the wing it's like people are 
[02:22:30]  willing to sacrifice their lives to get somewhere a half hour earlier way to mean nothing good  i was just i think most people would be annoyed i think my favorite part about uh private which  was also kind of creepy was every time i get a new pilot i would always ask uh hey have you ever  seen any any ufos no and they i not normally is it like yes but it's just so known that there's  crazy shit out there but they don't they all said the same thing they go they go look oh yeah i used 
[02:23:00]  to fly united blah blah blah one night this you know this thing rockets bias but none of them will  report it because if you report it then you're going to lose your job because you're going to be  deemed as you know yeah as crazy unstable so that's the best part is they all have some of the most  unbelievable like you know we could end up talking about conspiracy stuff for the next two hours all  kinds of stories and awesome they can't tell like the beginning of close encounters no i don't want  to report one of those things the pilot would you like to report uh negative oh yeah i mean i had 
[02:23:30]  this one guy this you know this guy literally like you know a sully uh type guy like you know old school  you know world war ii ah yeah we used to we used to drink with the foo fighters we'd land and you know  we'd uh you know check out their craft it was like it's just some of the most unbelievable stories  of like what the hell is actually out there yeah they really airline pilots are guys who i hold  i i mean maybe i shouldn't hold them in esteem but i take their accounts as credible they're the 
[02:24:00]  ones who should be reporting this stuff anytime you hear like audio of military like looking for  stuff on the radar air traffic control those guys are normally not fucking crackpots so i wish they  would talk more publicly about it crackpots i know aunt jim fucking pipes in again aunt jim those guys  aren't as buggy as one would think they're a bunch of crackpots they are  they are the flotsam and jetsam of the airline exactly well maybe i'll see an ac man because i'm 
[02:24:30]  going to be down there for a couple of days so uh maybe i'll hook up everyone's down there this  weekend it's going to be a fucking madhouse yeah you get to see dane cook you get to see jim norton  and uh and people are inviting you to their houses to to watch the big fight jimmy well i don't know  where would you go to a listener's house to watch the city yeah i would sure on a freshly stolen  television it is a little rough when you get out when you get out of the compound you have some  unfunny cracker and they'd punch me in the face the worst feeling is leaving atlantic city and 
[02:25:00]  realizing you need gas oh boy i know no you never do that not good why your limo driver doesn't uh  fuel up before i don't have a limo driver oh shit yeah oh that's great for you oh  all right dane dane's gotta fly so dane cook trump taj mahal this weekend friday nine o'clock show  saturday eight o'clock show ticketmaster.com or trump taj.com right that's it come see us soon  dane will you yeah you know i was actually flying to new york originally until uh i think you guys

[02:30:30]  in a plug for me at the end of the show and he couldn't sit down and write two words for us  all right no problem because i want to ask you about the video uh dr steve made a video where  there's a needle going into his eyeball yeah did you see it yes it was pretty disturbing and uh  the video did very well for you dr steve so you got to do more videos like that uh but then i i  learned something where you have 20 20 vision well you have glasses though so you can't really have 
[02:31:00]  20 20 vision but yeah okay i was 20 20 okay and then what happens all of a sudden his vision gets  really fucked up and goes like 2200 on him out of nowhere so the steroid that's popped into your  eyeball helps that yeah yeah it does actually uh you know that i was 2200 and i'm probably back to  2050 now but you know eventually it'll cause cataracts and glaucoma so the end result is inevitable  it's just delayed jesus well you don't know about that you don't know what the future holds with 
[02:31:30]  medicine and stuff and i i stay on top of that research for uh uveitis believe me um you know  it's uh they've got this stuff now that you can uh what what i've got is this inflammation of uh of  the retina and uh it's uh antibodies my own stupid fucking body is attacking my own retina and uh so it  causes all this swelling and then you know it doesn't retract properly so the images look all crazy and 
[02:32:00]  jumbled and all that kind of but the good news then they hit you with the steroid and it goes back  to you know normal right yeah god that's so weird i like to creep everybody out with the videos of me  getting my eyes right but why does your body attack itself why why does the human body do that well it  gets confused in rheumatoid arthritis it'll do that where the you know you get antibodies to the joints  and then if you get there are certain conditions where antibodies will attack different parts of the 
[02:32:30]  body like the heart and stuff like that and what what the theory behind it is is that you get some  bacteria or some virus that the body makes an antibody to you know to fight it off and then it  just turns out that the protein that it made the antibody to kind of looks like say proteins that are  in your retina and so those antibodies hang around and just start attacking the retina  you're creeping out anthony and you want to take a break this body is too fucking weird yeah it's 
[02:33:00]  just a bunch of goop that's supposed to work right we're just goop or foe transponders on airplanes so  you know not to shoot down the good guys yeah and it's just like uh you know the transport the  receiver gets screwed up and looking at friendly things as being following it isn't that wonderful  you have to trust the goop inside you to be doing the right thing for all that goop has to do the  right thing yeah wonderful all right enough about that uh it's it sounds like you're doing better  which uh you know i'm not gonna make any jokes i'm glad i'm glad uh glad you're doing better 
[02:33:30]  yeah we do have a great weird medicine this weekend and uh it was insane  who's not what do you have on no i'm amazed at this because uh dr steve came up with the vodka  tampon challenge and we started laughing like get the lawyers ain't gonna let you do this but it looks  like uh with some adjustments you're doing the vodka tampon challenge this weekend on weird medicine 
[02:34:00]  saturday at midnight right after special delivery which is salmon day inspired by a conversation  that we had on this show where those frat boys were taking uh little thimblefuls of vodka and putting it  under their eyelids and we thought right stupid we'll have a woman cram a vodka laden uh tampon up her  snage and see if it uh if it takes her drunk because that is a myth that's out there there are a lot of  women that are doing this it tends to be uh girls who for whatever reason don't want vodka on their 
[02:34:30]  breath and so they think that they can um get drunk this way and my theory was that it wouldn't work  because who wants to absorb you know you don't want your vagina absorbing things right no so where'd  you find the woman to uh you know stick a a vodka soaked tampon up her cunt  he's the one that tasted pat from unaki's urine on yeah ah uh his girlfriend is oh sorry sorry for 
[02:35:00]  calling his girlfriend uh horrible names but she's a good egg and uh she decided that she'd uh do it for  great all right um well i'll be listening saturday at midnight all right right after special delivery  with sam and dave weird medicine and uh now i understand the the shitty wine by the way  oh no you're blind as a bat when you're making this shit oh leave the leave the gentleman alone 
[02:35:30]  i'm obsessed with by the way steven is shitty wine i will never let it go there's an interesting  photo of you in the post signing legislation  dr c does do it it's almost that bad it's almost that bad you do do a great show weird medicine is a  should be a nationalist indicated show it's tremendous it really is it's on serious xm it's  you know i tried for you buddy but uh i don't know they're not listening to me so that show should 
[02:36:00]  be all over the country on regular radio it's a perfect show for regular radio because you doctors  could get away with shit uh regular guys on radio can't guys could say all kinds of shit because  it's medicine that's right that's right that's right no i've really uh uh enjoy the um i'm perfectly  happy having some air time yeah you know we had two oh i know we have really fucking hot girls  really oh how much medicine are we going to talk about exactly i hope he's laughing right now we

[02:44:00]  why they're trying to avoid grenades in miami i got you oh i'd hate to get grenades i'd rather get  yellow aids or blue aids yeah we got it color color colors yeah you ever deal with an iceberg  what's that my brother brett came up with that i think it was first time i heard it where you see  a girl you know at the bar and and from the bar up holy mother of god and then you go over there  and like an iceberg does a hell of a lot more going on underneath the bar underneath that you 
[02:44:30]  didn't see yeah hey dr steve's back i thought you meant that an iceberg was when you get someone and  she's really cold and jewish dr steve has bad mic technique talks too loud dr steve oh were we  having a private conversation that i wasn't supposed to bring up on the air i forgot what was that uh well  you said you made comesies in the doctor's office when he stuck a finger up your butt  i said mouth his mouth was that private if it was i apologize no no if i tell you something i 
[02:45:00]  it's you assume that i'm gonna go on the air the next day with her i mean i kind of assume that the  nature of the beast that uh it's not nothing's private now i'm a little confused because uh i've had  uh at least four fingers up my ass in the last few years at the same time and never and i have no  desire to fucking make comesies what is that about well it's uh you know shit now when i go oh i can 
[02:45:30]  hear it  crushers on really good i'm gonna have to work on that vocal crutch  my if your prostate is it all congested when they go in there and if you've got a  a monster-fingered freak like my doctor is  um then when they put the pressure on the on the prostate it'll extrude fluid out you're not 
[02:46:00]  actually having an orgasm oh it'll extrude fluid so you're just leaking clear stuff  yeah yeah watery clear stuff yeah it's slightly milky clear stuff it's uh it's a  he came  yeah but you don't have an orgasm it's just basically hydraulics you know there's pressure  and then whatever you say to yourself to make it okay  whatever you have to say to get through shaving  whatever you have to say sir 
[02:46:30]  like they say you have to uh you have to please the sissy in the mirror  we'll do this on purpose a lot of times if someone's got a prostate infection you'll  massage their prostate so that you can get through it put it on a slide and look at it  jesus what a whacked out job you got oh man hey um why don't you tell your doctor to use like a  smaller finger yeah well i you know you gotta use your index finger you can't get any other finger 
[02:47:00]  in there far enough because it's just the way the hand is constructed you know so you end up using  your index finger he's just a monster finger big mitts on him right yeah big old mitts  wow that's yeah and and and how do you feel after you you come in front of a male doctor oh god  oh he feels violated was it all over his office or did you have your underpants up in the front  he's sprayed yeah it kind of drips down between you know between your legs onto the little 
[02:47:30]  you're supposed to step up on the exam table how great is that now if you're if you're doing it on  purpose you have the guy hold the slide down under their penis and that's a real that's a that's a  treat sexy getting there holding that and then and then when the fluid comes out they're like oh  my god there's fluid coming out of my penis yeah dr steve is a fruit dr steve as a as a doctor what's 
[02:48:00]  the worst thing you have to do where you go oh fuck i'm gonna do this again today this is what i used  to say to my patients when i was doing a lot of uh family medicine is that you know uh is it worse  to get a prostate exam done to you once a year or to have to do 10 of them a day  you know and i think it was a little bit of a trade-off so that's one of the worst things i you 
[02:48:30]  know what the worst thing that you can that i would do would be lancing um abscesses on the ass or  the back or something like that and when they're under pressure and when you lance it and the puss and  you're not expecting it and it shoots out you know shoots across the room and it stinks it's foul smell  oh my god i can't i got tapping out it is happening wow but that's the worst thing when you realize you 
[02:49:00]  got that on the docket you're not happy it's when you're doing it and you didn't realize how much  pressure it was under and it goes shooting out i mean i've had it all i've had it occlude my vision  because it got on my glasses jesus oh you got bukkake by puss jesus christ do you have the proper skill  set to do this it's just one of those you know if you do an infinite number of procedures over your  career and everything's going to happen and you know i've done quite a few uh uh abscess did you feel 
[02:49:30]  faint or nauseous the first time oh the the time that it got in my mouth i did yeah fuck hey uh do  you have to look at old lady veg oh yeah yeah yeah does it oh yeah what does it look and smell off  hours really uh for the most part old lady vaginas don't smell they've lost their estrogen they're not  producing fluid down there so it's not bad i mean you know it's just part of the job it's a part of 
[02:50:00]  the anatomy like any other part is gravity's taking its toll though right uh sometimes you can uh one  of the things that women get with they get older is prolapse of their organs so sometimes you'll see  a bladder wall sticking out of the vagina or you'll see a uterus or something like that all right keep  talking dr steve you keep talking yeah yeah bladder fucking wall and of course well of course danny's got 
[02:50:30]  to pop it up on on google good boy danny but your your job is to push that bladder back in with your  cock that isn't what are we looking at they make these things called pessaries danny could uh  could search that jesus christ oh my god the bladder wall is coming out of the vagina no is that  look at the hemorrhoids no no would you lick that asshole and pussy oh god what does she carry  would i safe hunter back she's a safe carrier that's what she does she works for brinks

[02:58:00]  are i wanted to session with you uh-huh you were at the nutcracker uh very long time ago okay  that's how many years ago is that that's like 99 was that that many years ago her name  is that that many years ago and because you don't know what you're gonna get there  yo you do yeah that's ball kicking  yeah a trip to the hospital you're lucky but i had wanted to do golden shower i didn't know if you  did it but i had wanted to see you i told you i was a pee fetishes but i mean back then i that  should have clicked that you are that jade vixen i looked at your photos i don't know who was on 
[02:58:30]  eros or what site it was on uh fucking talking like you went to the same high school but oh  remember i wanted you to piss on me right i told you i pissed on people we have the same home room  i i just didn't make the connection like this is the jade that i had i don't know why i didn't i  think i even called a couple of times i probably hadn't gone to a dungeon at that point it was that  was fucking 10 years ago 11 years ago wow so i was like 30 i was a young 30 looking to explore 
[02:59:00]  looking for a dungeon a salty warm beverage and i have since i've heard many many times  it got back to me it's pretty hilarious yeah yeah i'm a dirty boy but i didn't realize that  you were the same jade vixen that had the you know had the fucking frightening experience yes it was  very highly unpleasant um and you know i guess you i would like to ask you about it because i did the 
[02:59:30]  last time but it was simply because i thought i mixed the name up with anthony's  television but it's a fascinating story and and you're here which is is great um you were a dom  are you still a dom or no no actually i quit doming like quite a while ago oh you did and  it's just one of those things where news media likes to take a spin on you and they will just  dig up photos that are no longer even linked to you they're no longer active and you're just like  where the hell they even get these right right or they'll go through event photos and then like  misconstrue them it's like you're at this event so therefore that must be your slave and i'm like 
[03:00:00]  actually that's just an event i was doing for fun i was dressed up you know like so you were a dom at  one point and then uh were you doing fetish modeling for i was doing fetish modeling but  like i do mostly fetish fashion i don't really do video you know i do like solo girl soft core i dress  up in my latex outfits like we talked about last so any photo screen cap from that is going to be  like and she's still a dominatrix that's pretty much what they did whatever they want they wonderful  once it's on the internet it's there forever girls oh yes remember that when you're sexting 
[03:00:30]  be careful we're much too old to be sexting be careful we're too old to be sexting we're not 13 year  old oh well you should see the ones i get that's great love it so you were even the texts smell like  i just have to put oh how cute um and what was it i guess two years ago yes you were what walk us 
[03:01:00]  through what happened who was this person and what i don't even know how to start he was like  i didn't have my own pay site up back then my site is live now jadevixen.com but i was like  gathering content for it and this was like somebody that found me on myspace became like a really  obsessive fan and wouldn't leave me alone you know to the point where like when i started ignoring  him he started like posting like he made like a fake like myspace video channel with my real name  on it and my and posted my address and my cell number like he was getting really aggressive with 
[03:01:30]  stalking me and it was one of those had he met you at parties because they have fetish parties where  nothing really happens no i think it's like a meet and greet and get get all dolled up you know yeah  i don't go to play parties quote unquote because that's kind of like that's not my scene  you know right but um just yeah i mean i was at a big i was at fetish con and like he like flew me  down there which was really nice and like he was like can you just walk around this party with me  on a leash i'm like sure you know but i'm like i was there to network i'm like sure i'll wander around  with you those are the pictures that the press grabbed and slammed everywhere was he a kind of 
[03:02:00]  was he like a casual slave not a lifestyle slave but a casual definitely not a lifestyle slave i mean  it was one of those people where i'm like hey go like go to whole foods here's my grocery list drop it  off thanks see ya you know right right or like take me shopping for shoes you know it was that kind of  absolutely yeah kind of like a financial slave yeah sure that that's the relationship that a lot  of guys like they like it's not just about fucking that sometimes you never fuck your dom it's just  a weird relationship of servicing them and doing these weird things for them that aren't even  sexual sometimes but then when i just said hey like you're you know you're getting a little you're 
[03:02:30]  getting in over your head you're getting too obsessive your behavior is kind of screwy  you know and i have a boyfriend i'm kind of quitting the business you know of like of like even  entertaining men like like you like i don't want to field phone calls or text messages from you  guys like i just want peace and quiet in my life right he could not take it he couldn't take the  fact that you were kind of moving on from that part of your life and leaving that part of the  business i was just like look i want to concentrate on having my own member site and doing photography  and modeling and what i love i do not need to babysit adult men that need attention yeah what was 
[03:03:00]  his thing what was his main uh what was his main thing was he a pain guy or what did he like  he wasn't a pain guy um he was just he was more into like the outfits and the look okay on you  yeah on me but he also was a member of god knows how many pay sites all he would half his emails  to me were like and have you seen this model and her site you know so it wasn't it was more just  like he wanted to interact with someone that like was a fetish model more than anything else  now did he did he did he want to sleep with you or did he know that it was an impossibility that  was impossibility and he knew that that wasn't really his mo because i'd hear about the 
[03:03:30]  girls he would date left and right right so did he feel did he did he fall in love with you do you  think um i think it was more of an obsession something very twisted because he was very  mentally unstable sure i mean i guess apparently he had a mental health history which is why i found  out after the fact he had been like institutionalized like like involuntarily committed multiple times  wow and so he was getting more and more aggressive with you he put your actual name on the internet  with information that could lead to who you really are i think is probably what it is right it 
[03:04:00]  sounded like to me i mean so what finally what started happening when you realized this was  getting to be a very very dangerous issue i actually retained an attorney and was about  to file a personal criminal complaint and he beat me to it by 12 hours by abducting me  like the next morning i was supposed to go down to a court i was supposed to go down and file my  person i didn't want to call the cops and then try to get restraining order that way because that  usually will set off someone who's a time bomb you know you're better off filing a personal  criminal complaint with a district attorney and having them make make the phone calls  you know it's a lot more quieter the person's not arrested you know so so how did he abduct 
[03:04:30]  you what was going was he a big guy i don't remember he was huge he was like a steroid junkie i swear  to god oh wow really yeah like imagine like six two and jacked up on steroids wow and what  happened it's like meds not pretty where were you jesus that is a disaster waiting to happen yeah  because physically it's just it's a very uh i mean obviously i don't just say why it's a fucking  problem yeah so where were you and what was the situation um actually my boyfriend um really 
[03:05:00]  thought i wasn't safe as a guy i've been making all these weird threats to me and then i changed  my cell number that weekend so i really i couldn't see what lunacy he was sending because my cell phone  was turned off and no one had the new number and did he know the cell was turned off no i guess he  must he was sending me 200 texts a day calling me non-stop and my phone company wouldn't block it  so they're like we'll give you a new number i'm like at&t you had no really they wouldn't block it  no actually most phone companies won't block annoying numbers okay they tell you to get a  new number i'm like well that's highly inconvenient sure yeah of course so he's sending you all these  texts and your boyfriend how long you've been dating the guy you're dating um we had known each 
[03:05:30]  other for quite a while we've been dating for about four months at that point okay so you're kind of  friends that turned into more yeah and so this guy is sending you all this bizarre stuff and you're  feeling threatened and your boyfriend's feeling like this is and my boyfriend is an attorney and he was  like uh you need to do something about this he goes he goes here you know call your lawyer go file  some paperwork and you know i i think you know it'll blow over he was like it's like he was like  don't pour oil he's like don't set off someone who's already this crazy just kind of deal with it  you know did this guy know your real address um i think he followed me and got my real address 
[03:06:00]  he was following me he like staked out my apartment he knew when i was coming and going i didn't know any  of this jesus stop talking to someone for six weeks and this is what happens yeah so it was  legitimately a stalking situation now what happened how were you abducted and where were you  um so usually like i mean my boyfriend like i mean he lived in new york and i was living in philly at  the time and he would always go to work monday morning so sunday night i was usually by myself 
[03:06:30]  and he for some reason he was like no i don't feel safe with this guy lurking around i'll just come  down with you and i'll take the 5 a.m amtrak back up to new york i'll be at my office sometime i'm  like okay great we just bought the amtrak ticket so we drove down from new york to philly and like  i stopped at like a diner like down the street my house was like openly i was like yeah let me grab  like a quick burger or nibble and then you know go home you know and go to bed early because  of this and then like i was living in this really crazy loft building so i drove in through the  parking garage which had a big like industrial gate with an opener and and it opened i drove in 
[03:07:00]  parked my car i was about to grab my bag out of the back of the car and i hear someone yelling i'm  like what the fuck and there's this wacko holding a gun i'm like what was he had he walked in as  the garage door open he must have run in before closed yeah okay so you're alone or you're with  your boyfriend i'm with my boyfriend and he comes in with a gun and what is it what is he saying  it's like i think he tried to drag me off you know i was like he's like get over here i'm like  hell no you're holding a fucking gun are you insane you know and your boyfriend's in the passenger 
[03:07:30]  seat or driving that passenger seat okay but he me and him had both gotten out of the car and like  i was like pulling bags out of my trunk so i totally had my back to him when the guy came running in  okay and what what did he what did your boyfriend do what was his reaction he was like hey i think  he was like hey stop chill out why don't we talk about this this is ridiculous and like the guy was  just like there's just no reasoning with a madman i mean there's nothing else you can say so what  did he do um he shot my boyfriend and then he grabbed me he like dragged me out so he shot your 
[03:08:00]  boyfriend one time yeah once and he killed him yeah jeez and i was trying to hit i i was like  trying to dial 911 off my cell phone but like because the garage is underground it didn't go  off and like he like grabbed my phone and threw it and you know he grabbed my phone and i tried  dropping my keys just anything so someone would think something was wrong if they saw the keys and  all that stuff floating around you know right they wouldn't just see your car parked closed up  properly yeah so he's just shot and killed your boyfriend and you know that you know your  boyfriend's there at this point or you don't know that you just i didn't know i really wasn't sure 
[03:08:30]  i really couldn't see it was just like such a it was like a flash you know and then you go with him  because what happens he grabs you he had the gun to my head he dragged me out of there and what was  he saying to you he was like he was like this is for ignoring me he's like i told you i was gonna  come for you and i'm like what the fuck are you talking about you delusional bastard you know did  you say that or were you trying to calm him down or were you angry more scared what was your i just  start screaming on top of my lungs yeah and he put you in a car yeah he dragged he had rented a car 
[03:09:00]  so i i didn't see his car in my lot or anything okay yeah all right so it was obviously something  he knew that i was totally premeditated sure sure so what happened when he brought you in because  this to me the amazing part of the story was that you're still here after such a crazy  fucking person attacks you what what happens once you got in the car um he drove around for a couple  hours with me he sexually assaulted me thank you new york post you're not supposed to publish names  of victims of sexual assault did he was it was it a was it a rape or was it just inappropriate he was 
[03:09:30]  like groping me and i was like i think i bit him at one point i was like i'm gonna fucking die before  you touch me right so he was doing something that he probably a big part of it had been like he had  been in this this relationship with you that he thought that you didn't think and he wanted much  more than you were going to give and he just couldn't and he had to just grab you no actually i just  stopped talking to him i told him go away get lost i have other things going on in my life and  he couldn't accept that so you were fighting him did he park to try to assault you and then drive  off i think he tried parking but then he was being paranoid and it was just what were you saying to 
[03:10:00]  him at this time i'm just like can you just just blow my brains out or let me go i'm fucking sick of  this yeah right oh really he drove me around like like i don't know five six hours wow was he  don't even have a clue what his moods were going like this like seriously like a minute later his  moods were changed and then then he started calling all of his friends um started leaving  like suicide um like started calling up his whole family telling him like sorry this is the end  goodbye and i'm just like oh my god what was he say like what kind of would he have an anger move 
[03:10:30]  he'd yell at you oh yeah happy it's a good cop bad cop good cop bad cop like 45 seconds later his  mood would shift like were there any times where you thought his friends were trying to get him to  turn himself in and that didn't work oh he actually got people on the phone oh yeah at like two in the  morning on a sunday day were there times that were you thought i could probably jump out right  about now no no no there's no way no there's no way i could grab the gun away from there's nothing  i could really do you're kind of like fuck were you talking to him like because again being a dom 
[03:11:00]  you have a certain insight into people's psychology it's like you guys really have but when someone's  rapidly shifting having these crazy mood swings there's nothing you can predict right so what did  you do to kind of combat each mood like if he was how were you because if you were just like fuck you  when he's angry it's just you know escalate angrily at each other and then you're probably  gonna get well no the funny thing is like when you just say fuck off to someone who's saying things  to you they're inflammatory sometimes it just stops and they're like what you know but i just i refuse  to like i'm like i'm not begging for my life you can go fuck yourself oh you didn't have to no i'm 
[03:11:30]  like i refuse to i'm like you know what go fucking do it i will not beg for anything that is mine so  fuck off you know and what what finally happened you were riding around for hours he had been  leaving messages for people talking to people talking crazy to people so the cops knew obviously  no the cops didn't know because his friends just thought he was on a fucking drug or drinking bender  oh man they didn't call the cops no was he drugged out when he came to you probably oh you don't know  i have no idea i mean roid rage is pretty damn powerful i mean so the upshot of it was he's driving 
[03:12:00]  you around and what finally happened like because um i don't know i i guess like i was like i mean i  have anxiety disorder so like i was like uh dude i'm having i mean i was having a panic attack from  the first second he showed up i'm like dude i can't take him i'm gonna piss myself yeah i started  really bitching about it i was like i can't take this i can't take this like just a little bit more  i'm like i'm like a little bit more of what you know he was saying just a little bit more and then  well he was just like he was like oh i don't know if i should kill you and me you know romeo and  juliet style i'm like that's not romeo and juliet style you're not very well read yeah there's nothing 
[03:12:30]  worse than the guy misinterpreting a famous novel time like that it was painful it was painfully  funny i was like oh my god nowadays tears later i can see the humor in it sure the gallows humor i  guess yeah yeah yeah and how did you finally get out of the car he for some reason i was like i was  trying to convince him to drop me off at a hospital because i was like i was like look i'm really gonna  freak out or faint or a class out because my my heart rate's sky high like i can't take this anymore he was  like oh you know what i'll drop it from my parents house they'll take care of you oh wonderful yeah 
[03:13:00]  great is that what he did yes that's what he did and i went running through the woods like he dropped  me off on a side road and he drove off but i had the description of the car already i ran into his  parents house and like ring the doorbell and i'm like calling 9-1-1 off my cell phone oh you still  had your phone yeah i'm calling 9-1-1 on my cell phone i'm like hi um you should go to this address  uh my boyfriend was shot and then i started calling hospitals and fire departments see if he had  anyone had pulled like had any ambulances that showed up there and um his parents are just like 
[03:13:30]  in disbelief i mean they knew their son was mentally ill but they were but you know it's they thought  it was under control they're like what the hell is going on here so you uh you eventually got he  would know what happened to him he blew his brains out after the standoff with cops was like i i mean  i called the cops and gave him the description of the car and where he was driving and they found him  like probably like not even an hour later oh okay because he was probably driving erratically or  whatever they knew what to look for there's not many guys driving around crazily like that on a  sunday yeah 4 a.m on a sunday night yeah so he we when he shot himself were you were you hey look 
[03:14:00]  they were trying to get me to talk him down on the phone yes his local police precinct thought it  would be good if i talked to looney tune i'm like no i've been sitting in the car for six hours and  then i think when i realized that no ambulance had picked up my boyfriend i was like you know my  boyfriend's fucking dead this fucker deserves to die i'm not helping you out good good for you  i told the police precinct i was like i think his parents called there i'm like you know what  fuck your son deserves to die whether he gets shot by a cop or he kills himself he deserves to die 
[03:14:30]  i'm not helping i'm like i'm like you know as much as i want to see him rot in prison that's not  really pleasure to me i'm sorry you deserve to die there's some things that are just you don't  deserve to live for and that's one of them so you refuse to to talk him down good good wow it's great  to hear i mean that's exactly how you say a lot of people would be there oh yeah okay i'll talk  and the whole time he was sending me text messages on my blackberry wait after he left after when he  was in a standoff with cops he said they're texting me on the blackberry were you answering him no 
[03:15:00]  because i i think like even though i changed the phone number the blackberry messenger function was  still working he was sending me messenger messenger the blackberry messenger i fucking text back kill  yourself kill yourself no i'm not that much of an asshole but i refuse to i refuse to tell the cops what  were they saying the text messages like like you turned me in i'm like what the fuck was i  supposed to do obviously this is someone who's like shoe size and his iq were about the you know  the scene what a piece of shit i am wow he felt betrayed because you turned him in yeah wow 
[03:15:30]  definitely a psychopath wow it's i kind of the last time i was like how do we not talk about that  because you know look it's it's a terrible thing but it's it's an event you know what i mean it  happened it's an event it's a life-shattering not talk about that and when and after you had left i  was so mad because like i when i heard that happened i read about the papers a lot of stuff  like i remembered i'm like oh my god that that's the person that you had wanted to see it was like  a weird it's like this weird kind of not quite meetings yeah and you're you're just you know  you're very bubbly i do want to include uh ryan in this how does your ass react to this story i 
[03:16:00]  would like to know yes uh it is gorgeous halfway through that story is uh clenching in fear like oh my  but but halfway through that story she needed a hug bad i i could see that you should have hugged  did you know the story ryan or had you had you heard it told like that or i hadn't heard it  directly from jade and actually i had heard some things but when something really terrible happens  to someone i'd rather wait to hear it from the source oh thank you lady well that's scary because  i mean it's very scary and it's such a thing for you know all models who they really need to be

[03:21:00]  dom number where i spend i saw you tweeting about that yeah i spend like the first you know it's a  five song set i spend the first three songs like literally being bringing people up on stage and  beating the holy living crap out of them oh really and it's like it's my it's how i always end the show  because i'm like beat the crap out of people and then i do like um i like sensation play but i'm not  submissive what is sensation play what's that well for this example oh just kind of scratch it's like 
[03:21:30]  light tickling or like even like ice or hot or like fur but i do it with hot wax actually  so i invite the audience you know everyone who i've beaten the crap out to have a little retribution  and pour hot wax all over my naked body oh that's kind of hot there's something called what are we  waiting for where's the candles yeah exactly we're really unprepared aren't we really we just throw  matches on you guys that don't get it we set newspaper on fire and hand it to you all those  things would smell bad jimmy yeah jimmy the matches would just smell really bad so it's burning hair 
[03:22:00]  is oh yeah it's terrible there's something called sound this is how like literally like you think you  know sounds i thought was guys who get into having weird noises by their head no like like i swear to  god where something like they'll they'll tie you up and go in your ear and you're like but it's so  much different it's completely different it's much worse what what is it well do you want the medical 
[03:22:30]  history of sounds i would like the medical history of sounds um prior to modern antibiotics  and modern medicine when someone got an std stds usually cause scarring when not treated and you're  in a man you'd have a damn hard time pissing because all the scar tissue would form in your  urethra and same thing for a woman so sounds are um these metal rods oh they're about this long  how long a foot long and they come in different sizes based on the diameter of them all right 
[03:23:00]  that um a doctor would um insert them starting at the smallest one all the way into your urethra  and going and just up gauging in size until they opened you up enough so you can piss again  so they're basically stretching your cock hole yes your entire urethra with metal  now would they would they do this all in the same moment like like they would just keep putting them  if you couldn't piss no they put one in and then they go the next size up if the size changes are  gradual in in in how long period of time um depends on how much your body relaxes but um 
[03:23:30]  usually with the sounds it's like you can get one in oh you mean it's in the same section oh yes  how big of a sounds have you ever put in because i've seen photos of people that have sounds and  then literally close to a dime yeah that's really large i mean most people would use like a 14 french  sound which is like much much smaller it's like maybe half the diameter of a pencil oh really yeah  and they just put in the cock hole yeah it drops in with weight of gravity you support it 
[03:24:00]  this is making me lightheaded yeah yeah yeah i'm like uh i'm all woozy and nauseous by the way can  anybody we have two really gorgeous fucking penthouse girls here nobody can remove the sexy like i can  yeah yeah you have done a great job of taking every bit of sexy i apologize to to ryan and jay in the  i am a fucking a sexy vibe fucking vacuum i just ruined it i just opened the plane door and all the 
[03:24:30]  sexy got sucked out it's just a room full of people screaming wind in our face and all the men are  squeezing their legs together yeah that's yeah yeah i was literally literally grabbing my cock just  squeezing just you know when you walked in just hope you never get just hope you never get an  accident where you need a catheter because that's pretty much the same no i know and it's much  thicker and that stays in at least a catheter is put in by like an md or a nurse but sounds  well sounds used to be put in by doctors before but now it's just somebody in heels who wants to 
[03:25:00]  beat the shit out of you for an hour yeah it's kind of not very sterile are very well trained yeah you  know and are very sterile yes i mean all you do is autoclave everything you know the autoclave is like  that's when you heat clean things isn't that they do heat and pressure that's like how they  clean medical equipment yes that's how they clean medical is that what they do in dungeons they  autoclave well clean ones do yeah how do they clean i've never been fucked with a strap on i've  been close but i can't take it i sterilize mine i use um you have a strap on if you watch that movie

[03:27:30]  straight um oh really huh but you know i you know i had a good time because like for me you know i  get the most sexual gratification about giving pleasure to my partner like that's what i'm really  into and then when she wasn't reciprocating i'm like i'm gonna use my strap on skills  so you basically punished her yes i punished her with my big black cock  was it black it was actually yeah she wouldn't take my big my big toy is flesh colored but she  was being like a piss she got punished because she wouldn't take the big toy or give me an orgasm 
[03:28:00]  how big was the big toy um i'd say about eight inches  yeah are you a size queen no not at all i like when girls are yeah just turns me on the idea that  they are it's so dirty you know you like biggings do you big cocks don't know what they're doing with  it i mean they think they're god's gift to women because they have a large penis but then don't  father ever learning how to use it yeah that i mean like i'm talking about that in my seminar and  it's like you know some people do have advantages like charm and size but that kind of wears off after 
[03:28:30]  a few sack sessions you're like okay so your cock is big but you really don't know how to use it  that's when you're driving home and somebody's got a fucking porsche or ferrari and they're doing  60 in the left lane yeah it's like move that thing right you're like that is a waste of something  that could be awesome learn how to drive your cock that's the beauty of me i don't have a huge cock  and i don't know how to use it i'm full for two should come to my seminar yeah dr steve's checking in 
[03:29:00]  again okay yep we still do urethral uh sounding yes we still dr steve actually does that procedure  sure he does he's our doc he's our he's our show doctor and he uh more than yeah he's an md  he's the real deal okay and um he's a creep and he's almost blind and he takes fucking kerosene and  he passes it off his wine to his friends yeah he does he puts food dye in kerosene he makes really  shitty wine yeah it's fucking awful i think it's a great christmas gift so what what is your seminar 
[03:29:30]  uh ryan what are you going to be doing it's let me i will give a nice plug it's it's you can go to  pornstarsexlife.com and it's um july 10th july 10th which is a week from this saturday at the velour  lounge which is here in manhattan it's 297 10th which is right off 27th street um what it's an all-day  sex seminar on a saturday yes it's about eight hours actually they call you the tony robbins of  sex what exactly is that uh well the thing is is that the way that i start any sex seminar is that  it's um i'll read you my mission statement um well actually i won't but it's an educational 
[03:30:00]  inspirational seminar for people want to connect with their inner porn star and develop the confidence  and skills they need to satisfy their sexual partners the confidence to seek out new partners  and experience new behaviors like multiple partners group sex and fantasy play and the way  that we do that is we start the day off with like self uh self-sexual actualization and  problem solving because what keeps what is that say that again self-sexual actualization and  problem solving because most people what prevents them from being a good lover is you know confidence 
[03:30:30]  and intention and so they have all of these you know bullshit you know that that little voice in  the back of their head that says oh i suck in bed oh i haven't had enough experience oh i can never  be good at a little voice in the back of the head it's my partner as you're saying that i'm trying  to put together of joke and you just say it yeah well what we do and she's saying it over a fucking  with to a vuvuzella horn but we start you know first off we start the day you know and i talk to 
[03:31:00]  people about like you know have people like write down all of these things that like you know what  are they telling themselves that why they aren't good in bed and then we work through them and then  from there so we talk a lot about you know appreciating your inner person and like learning to love  your inner sexuality and learning to like let your inner sexual beast out and then from there what we  do is that we're actually going to have a really great um we're going to have a guest speaker come  in and talk about getting out of the friend zone because what i'm all about is roi like when you  meet someone and you have sex with them for the first time you want to make sure that you do such 
[03:31:30]  a good job that they keep coming back for more and so you want to make sure that you know with the  people you have in like like hot girls that are like you're in the friend zone with you want to get out  of that because you've spent a lot of time and energy on that relationship and you need to get  you know return in orgasm form see i think you'll be good at that because like a lot of people who  like a lot of times when when porn stars do uh seminars like that or whatever they're not  comfortable talking and they just kind of get to stand up there and be happy it's like you really  know what you're talking about well yeah it's it's i've actually spent a lot of time um writing this  out i've literally spent like the past weeks like locked in my apartment writing out this whole 
[03:32:00]  script for i mean we're full on doing you know seven hours in between banging blonde cheerleaders  with black strap-on biltos i call that research one minute she's like study breaks you know i i  have actually had to be very sexual in the last few weeks because i've had to like work out you know  what are the better sexual positions for you know ultimate orgasm potentials that work for you know  a variety of penis sizes and shapes across the board you know what are like the most um you know what 
[03:32:30]  are the sexual techniques that are going to work 90 of the time on 90 of the population because you  know i could spend you know three days teaching the kama sutra or i can spend you know one day  teaching you a variety of techniques that covers a broad spectrum of partners that will work 90 of  the time with 90 of the partners because there's always that 10 out there you just can't satisfy  what you do i might be in town orgasmic not orgasmic or they have their own issues or yeah i'd like to  volunteer my services i'm going to come down and do a little segment and it's going to be called  things to say when you can't get it up for any men out there that might have it will you really do 
[03:33:00]  that sure do you have one example that jimmy do i have an example yeah please all right say to me  uh what's wrong um this doesn't seem to be working right now can i can i do anything it's not you it's  the oil spill anything as an excuse my job anything how can you want to fuck at a time like this 
[03:33:30]  there are children starving as your limp dick is swinging it's just swinging back and forth no  no blood in it it's not even swinging i'm on my back and it's like a baby dick it's just standing  up straight it's so devoid of blood it just can't even bend it's like a shame the turtle head  it looks cold and devoid of all blood why have you ever seen the turtle head  just beyond me like she'd be naked and some guy's got a turtle head in front of her when you're in a 
[03:34:00]  relationship for a long time you know like the first three months are awesome because it's always  you know strong and it's pointing at you with intention and then you know after you know five  months or whatever you're like sitting on the couch and you're like i'm gonna touch your wieners  i'm gonna touch your wieners or my favorite thing is in the bathtub like i i love playing with cock i  admit to it oh they're endlessly amusing it's a great quote by the way i love playing with cock yes 
[03:34:30]  yeah you like just toying around with them i do i i love cock and this actually this has been an  amazing amazing seminar put together because i've gotten to do so much research oh and uh yeah and  the thing is we're actually going to go um you know best expositions and from there we're going to do 
[03:35:00]  things to learn and disregard in porn because i i recently um i've been having sex with this 23  year old maryl model worst worst decision of my life so pretty so dumb and keeps on trying to do  these things in the bedroom i'm like what are you doing i'm like why are you opening up for the camera  when there's no camera there and i realize that a lot of young guys are learning all their sexual  techniques from porn so i want to retrain them so what does he got his arm behind his back yeah  the whole thing he's like like yeah there's a camera by the door and meanwhile there's no fucking 
[03:35:30]  camera take both of your hands and grab my hips dummy yeah i'm like totally and but the thing is  is that i was asking a lot of my female friends you know i've been doing a lot of research for this  and talking to everyone and they're like yeah they keep doing all these like really strange things  in the bedroom i'm like they're learning that from porn and then i'm gonna actually have the  lovely jade help me with uh talking about hair pulling and choking and slapping and spitting and how to  do when it is appropriate to introduce that and when it is not like when you're kissing mom hello  for thanksgiving dinner don't spit in her mouth just like just punch her in the pussy 
[03:36:00]  mouth spitting i think can be very sexy yes when it's done correctly this is my technique not even  hygienic just when it's done at the right time like like don't talk a loogie yeah i've done that a few  times like while i'm on top she'll open her mouth and i'll go  no hawking up give her a good nicotine luke yeah like one of those thick  one of those horrible coughs those chest rattling coughs you don't want to brag that you just took 
[03:36:30]  some mucinex what's a bad time to spit what have you had bad times at the mouth spitting or face  spitting oh so many times well guys see it in porn so they see it in porn all of a sudden you get like  a face full of spit you're like seriously like sometimes i'll be dirty i'm like yeah spit in my  mouth and i'm a dirty girl to spit my so sometimes it's appropriate it's one of those like if someone's  asking for it do it if they're not asking for it don't surprise them it's like anal you never want 
[03:37:00]  to just like shove something up someone's ass without asking yeah that's for sure  you got a lot of experience with that one nah it's just one of those things you really do have to ask  yeah you don't want to just try to slide that in you don't want a surprise a goodie put it this way  she she's not gonna not notice like maybe she'll just think if i do it still fucking her but yet  again these guys watch porn they think they think they think they can just pull it out and stick it 
[03:37:30]  right in your ass yeah totally totally so there's all these silly things and so we're gonna do you  know at the end it's gonna be a q a it's gonna be me uh jade vixen um the lovely justine jolie  we'll be there answering like any and all dirty sex questions and then we'll do cocktails and fun  stuff but the thing is with the vip package they're getting a gift bag bag that's worth four hundred  dollars with sex toys books um and also personal coaching from both me and uh uh josh wosenberg from
