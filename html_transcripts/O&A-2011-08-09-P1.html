<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, shifting rapidly between them.  It began with a discussion of the economic downturn and the London riots.  The hosts found humor in a financial advisor's attempt to downplay the stock market crash and critiqued President Obama's response, comparing it unfavorably to previous administrations. They engaged in graphic descriptions of the London riots, playing audio from callers in London detailing the chaos and looting.  One caller, "Mike," shared a humorous anecdote about a wealthy, herpes-positive boss he was dating.  The hosts interspersed this with sexually explicit jokes and commentary about celebrities like Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez.  Andy Samberg was mentioned as a past guest promoting *Hot Rod*.  The discussion of the London riots continued, with the hosts expressing cynicism towards the "Pray for London" social media trend and comparing the suffering there to that of women experiencing violence elsewhere.

The show then transitioned to a segment about dog breeds, specifically comparing the fighting abilities of German Shepherds and Pit Bulls.  Callers provided anecdotes and opinions on various breeds, including Rottweilers and Caucasian Mountain Dogs.  A caller described a Pit Bull's resistance to a taser, and another recounted a story about a Caucasian Mountain Dog. The discussion included descriptions of dog fights and culminated in a disturbing discussion of a video depicting a dog being set on fire, provoking strong emotional reactions from the hosts and callers.

Next, the show launched into a comedic critique of sports talk radio, mocking its clich√©s and excessive drama.  They created a fictional "Who Cares Sports Talk Show" segment with absurd caller anecdotes, including one about a baseball team's superstition about blue-eyed players.  They extensively mocked Mike Francesca's radio show, mentioning prank calls made to it.  This led to a digression about *Rise of the Planet of the Apes*, followed by a discussion of an angry interaction between Troy, a call screener, and a caller, and  "Dr. Drew success stories" from *Celebrity Rehab*, contrasting Eric Roberts' supposed sobriety with his marijuana advocacy.  The segment was rife with profanity and offensive language.

The broadcast continued with the hosts dismissing a caller, followed by racially offensive jokes and self-promotion of their Twitter accounts.  They criticized *Celebrity Rehab*, *Celebrity Fit Club*, and *Dance with the Stars*, praising MTV for not canceling *Jersey Shore*.  The show then shifted to critiques of Hollywood movie production and reality TV, focusing on *The Ringer* and *Jersey Shore*, expressing concern that Uncle Nino from the latter might be a serial killer.  The interruption of a SiriusXM employee, Bobo, running through the hallway, caused further derision and led to Bobo's ban.  The hosts then speculated on upcoming Jackie Kennedy tapes, focusing on her alleged affair with William Holden and her beliefs about LBJ's involvement in JFK's assassination.  They also discussed various reality TV shows like *Superheroes* and *My Strange Addiction*, playing and discussing graphic clips with disparaging remarks. Gary, a regular show member, was present in studio during this part.


The show's final segment began by discussing upcoming guest appearances, including Vinny, Uncle Nino, Sammy Sweetheart, and DJ Pauly D.  The conversation drifted to a previous guest, Leah Thompson, and the show's schedule.  A promotional segment for the movies *Get High and Mighty*, *Your Highness*, and *Paul* followed.  Jimmy, a staffer, prepared for a trip to Los Angeles, joking about his return.  Anthony recounted a frustrating encounter with NBCU representatives, leading to brainstorming strategies to avoid future encounters, including using a body double.  The hosts ended by discussing post-show activities, the potential for further discussion about a previous incident involving Troy, an upcoming female guest, and a scheduled break.

[00:00:00]  Thank you. 
[00:00:30]  Thank you. 
[00:01:00]  Thank you. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you.  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  Hey, who's Jim Norton? 
[00:04:00]  That would be nice.  Good morning.  Hi, everybody.  How's everybody doing?  I don't know.  Dandy?  I don't know.  Fine and dandy?  I don't know.  Goodly?  I don't know.  I'm trying to figure out this stock market thing.  Oh.  And what it means for the country.  It's bad.  Yeah, but I look at all the morning Joes. 
[00:04:30]  Yeah.  And one guy, his name is even morning Joe, but the rest of them are morning Joes as well.  And they're all just kind of laughing and making jokes, so I guess the country's good.  I guess everything's okay if people are laughing.  That's what I measure it by.  If your morning TV guy is laughing and making jokes, it can't be that bad, right?  It can't be bad.  I don't know.  I see some panicky Pete's on some channels.  Some giggling on others.  But if America's collapsing, I don't think these morning Joes would be smiling and making jokes. 
[00:05:00]  Siddling while it's burning.  Yeah, I don't know, man.  I don't know.  And that's MSNBC.  You see them laughing.  I know our ass.  They have all faith in Obama.  I know our asshole financial guy put out his mass email yesterday trying to calm everyone down.  No, no.  Well, we saw this coming, and, you know, it was a thing that happened before this, and this is just a thing happening now.  But we already knew that this was coming, and we prepared for this, and our investors are afraid for him to prepare. 
[00:05:30]  Could cause some nervousness in the short term.  But in mid and long terms, the basic building blocks are still there in a way.  All right.  We prepared for this with a strong foundation.  You don't think you write interesting emails?  Oh, God, no.  All the technicals are still there.  Right.  Do you panic, though?  Because I lost a little money.  Of course.  Nothing crazy, but it's like, I think if everyone's losing, it's okay.  It's not just one thing. 
[00:06:00]  It's all relative.  It'll come back up.  But my question is, we all knew the stock market was going to fucking shit the bed yesterday,  so why didn't we all take our money out Friday?  Why didn't we just leave it in there?  A lot of people did.  That's why the fucking market went down.  The smart people.  But why didn't we?  I don't know.  We got the email.  We just kind of leave it in there.  Don't you worry.  We're long-termers with that.  Here at blank, blank, and blank, blank, we prepare for this.  I finally bought Apple yesterday. 
[00:06:30]  Did you?  Oh, you did.  Yeah, I just had to, finally.  Yeah.  Was it delicious?  No, it still tastes like a lot of money.  Yeah.  A few shares, yeah.  Yeah.  A few shares.  I buy the other apples.  It's safer.  Apple's probably a good buy, I would say.  You want me to read the email?  I would love you to read the email.  I would love you to read the email.  Okay.  Because it's hilarious.  Because when my statement comes out, I'm going to fucking shove his email back in his face.  It's not like he single-handedly ruined the market. 
[00:07:00]  Yeah, but we all knew it was going down.  So we should have just yanked everything and started over.  I'm a start over guy.  You're a start over guy.  Here we go again.  That's the email.  Here we go again.  Here we go again.  I think we can read this, because it's a mass email he sends to everybody. 
[00:07:30]  What does this mean?  S&P is not telling us anything that we didn't already know.  Right.  The U.S. economy is not as strong as it was five to ten years ago.  We know this.  And in short term, the effects of risk downgrade on the markets and economy could be substantial.  Do you know what's going on yet?  In the short term.  Yeah.  Just saying. 
[00:08:00]  Do you want me to continue?  I'd like a little more.  If it gets too personal, you've got to stop me there, because my fucking filter, I forgot it at home today.  Keep out names and fucking...  All right.  But over the mid to long term, we believe that the fundamentals, rather than one agency's opinion, will prevail.  Right.  Right there that says it.  They're praying that they've made the right decision for you.  Yeah.  Yes.  We believe fundamentals.  They have no idea.  Oh, fuck. 
[00:08:30]  This is why I didn't pay attention in class.  Who needs this shit?  Given current global economic and market events, the downgrade is one small piece of a much larger puzzle.  And the...  Puzzle.  The attention it has received is, arguably, exaggerated.  Ah.  Everyone spins.  Everyone's waiting for the dead cat bounce.  I'm fucking dizzy from everyone just spinning all the time.  Well, thank God Obama got on TV and spoke and reassured the people. 
[00:09:00]  Didn't he fucking...  Oh, it just went...  It tanked the second he started yapping.  Did you even read this email?  Oh, yeah.  It goes on and on.  Oh, it goes on and on.  Anatomy of a downgrade.  I won't bore you with that.  First, let's get the basics out of the way.  Yes, I am a bore.  That should be the first thing you wrote.  That's a whole paragraph.  Second, let's look at this in a rating agency context.  And then that's another huge paragraph.  Yeah.  Putting it into perspective is another huge fucking paragraph. 
[00:09:30]  You don't panic as much.  It just keeps going and going.  Who has time to read it?  The road ahead.  It's just reassuring everybody.  Really?  Let's people know he's not a Bernie Madoff over there.  This is a copy and paste email, man.  I don't appreciate the copy and paste.  Are you as nervous now as you were a couple years ago?  I'm not.  I don't give a fuck.  No?  Nah, I think everything's...  I don't care.  Everything's fucked.  Believe me.  But...  Whose fault is it?  It's like Bush was president when this happened in 08. 
[00:10:00]  And now Obama's president.  It happens no matter who's in office.  Oh, don't tell Anthony that.  But it's the truth.  It happened with Bush.  It's happened with Obama.  The economy is very cyclical, if you look, over history.  But what it takes is...  It takes us leadership to get the people's confidence back up.  The market tanks like this because of uncertainty.  People are very uncertain about the economy and the future of the country and its potential 
[00:10:30]  to earn money and get out of debt.  And there's really no big plan here to do that.  That bullshit that they signed last week, whenever it was, a couple weeks ago, it didn't instill  confidence in anybody.  There wasn't enough money cut to make up for the money that we're in debt.  So people are still like, that doesn't work.  And then Obama gets up and talks and he doesn't say anything. 
[00:11:00]  He doesn't have a plan.  He doesn't have a clear cut plan to say, here's what we're going to do.  I understand everybody's pretty nervous.  So here's a great plan.  Let's do this, this, this, this.  And this is, you know, shit he's got to do.  I'm not the president, so I'm not going to come up with fucking ideas.  I got a few.  But, you know, who am I?  I think how much boat rentals would be.  I think it's much bigger than just having a plan.  There's some shit going on that's finally coming back to kick us in the ass. 
[00:11:30]  But you've got to have some kind of fucking, you must instill confidence in the people.  The man has no fucking, the people do not have confidence in him.  I'm sorry, they just don't.  And this isn't me talking as a Republican or, you know, it's Obama's president.  It's President Widget.  Just whatever it is.  Whoever that guy is that's in there right now, no matter what color he was or fucking  party affiliation, no one has confidence in him. 
[00:12:00]  I don't think anyone has confidence in politicians in general at this point, though.  There's a few.  I think we're, uh...  Huh?  There's a few.  Who?  Who?  Who?  Just a few that are probably...  Who can we rally behind?  Tea partiers.  No, I'm serious.  Who can we rally behind?  I think people would have faith in the economics more with McCain than Obama.  Obama's to be more of an idealistic guy.  Even Hillary.  And I can't believe that's coming out of my mouth. 
[00:12:30]  I wouldn't have voted for her.  But even Hillary would have done a better job than Obama because she's at least got  more balls.  She's at least, you know, she'll get in there and fight.  But this guy, he's just a pussy.  He's a fucking pussy.  He doesn't really make the country feel good as a strong president.  He's got Jimmy Carter-itis.  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  As far as being a president that doesn't instill faith, confidence, and, you know, strength 
[00:13:00]  in the country.  He'll be out in the year.  Sorry.  You have one more year.  This mother...  One more year of hard days.  He's got one more...  If he can turn this around and get re-elected, wowie kazowie, what a job.  Because, you know, he can't use...  He can't even pull a Bin Laden card out.  Yeah, they should have saved that.  Like, hey, look, we killed him.  They should have saved that for, you know, later next year.  That's old hat.  Now everybody's worrying about the economy, and he so doesn't have a chance as we sit 
[00:13:30]  here today.  How can you have faith in Republicans either?  Because it's...  I remember when this happened in 08, and the banks were fucking...  And we remember we thought that Sirius was going to fold and all these come...  GM fucking fold.  I think they were all Republicans.  That was a Republican regime.  It was a different...  A different reason, too.  It was fucking...  It was companies that were running pretty much crooked.  They were fucking...  All these loan companies giving money out to people that absolutely could not pay their 
[00:14:00]  loans back, and they knew it.  And that caused the housing market to fucking crash.  That wasn't any real political move.  That wasn't something somebody could have done.  It was crooked companies.  But weren't they...  Let me ask you...  Standards are poor.  The people that fucking downgraded us, we're giving Lehman Brothers triple-A fucking ratings.  Hey, these guys are great.  This is the confidence I have in S&P. 
[00:14:30]  We get downgraded as a country, yet right before Lehman folded, they were like, this company's  fantastic.  Triple-A rated.  It's all bullshit.  Yeah.  They're all lying to us.  I don't blame one guy.  He happens to be the guy in the hot seat right now.  But you know what?  The president will always be the guy in the hot seat.  Oh, I know.  I understand that.  George Sr.  I understand how that works.  George Sr. pretty much was a hero after the first Gulf War.  We were saying, how the fuck?  This guy's getting elected.  He's going to be two-term president.  There's nothing that could happen. 
[00:15:00]  The economy took a shit.  He said he had the no new taxes line, raised the taxes, and he was out.  Out.  Because people will forget everything when the economy goes to shit.  Are you going to have confidence in the new guy?  I would hope to.  We'll see what happens.  We'll see what happens.  You know, it's one of those things.  You can't, you know, again, the futures are down over 100 points for the Dow.  Do we have another bad day on Wall Street?  Another, as they call it, bloodbath today. 
[00:15:30]  I hope my brother's making a shitload of money.  If everybody would have shorted.  Well, my brother's a day trader.  We should call him and see how he did.  You don't know how long to hold it, though.  He knows.  Sirius dropped.  It's like, I didn't want to sell it.  I'm not going to sell it.  Because they've reported good earnings, right?  You've got to wait until it comes back.  It's because of the market.  What did it drop down to?  165.  That's the lowest it's been in a while.  Yeah, it was up in the twos for quite a while.  $2.40 at one point. 
[00:16:00]  But, I mean, recently, like last week or two, a week, 10 days ago, it was like $2.15, $2.20.  Yeah.  I'll buy when it gets down to about a dollar.  I don't think it'll go much farther.  Oh, yeah?  I hope.  If they didn't have good earnings, I'd be panning.  It's all on the market.  It's nothing to do with Sirius.  It's not, right?  No.  That's what I say.  In my humble opinion.  So, there you go.  There's your buying opportunity today.  In my humble opinion.  I just want somebody to tell me it's going to be okay, and I don't know enough.  So, I'm just, if the answer is something that sounds positive, I'll pick up a spot right  and go, oh.  I'm going to forward the email. 
[00:16:30]  Everything's okay.  Everything's okay.  I'm going to read through this 100-page email.  Well, why did Michael Moore say, and I know he's just talking shit, but that the S&P head  should be arrested.  I know he's just yapping, but the S&P head does seem like a real hateable guy.  For the same shit that I was just talking about.  Okay.  Like, they were pretty much in on a lot of things that were happening when a lot of this  real estate shit was going down, and Lehman Brothers and stuff. 
[00:17:00]  They knew shit.  They made money on it.  They're all a bunch of fucking crooks.  And so, do they stand to gain during this downgrade?  Because eventually it will be upgraded again to AAA rating.  Is there a, and why do they even care what they say?  I couldn't imagine that everybody at the S&P, knowing that that downgrade was coming down,  didn't short the shit out of everything.  Oh, someone made money off this.  And make money off of it. 
[00:17:30]  Of course.  I'm making these accusations willy-nilly, and I have no proof, and I have no names or  anything.  But you've got to assume, when someone sees an opportunity to make what would be a lifetime  fortune.  What is S&P?  Standard and Poor's.  No, but I mean, what are they?  It's a rating company.  It's like anything else.  It's like privately, you get rated by, you know, those TRW and things like that. 
[00:18:00]  They rate companies.  Can we go back to the time before we made up all this shit?  Yeah.  There was a time we didn't have all this shit.  Yeah, yeah.  A simpler time.  A simpler time.  See?  It's gotten extremely complicated.  Meh.  Could it be, let me ask you, Ant, you know more about this than I say that like people  weren't sure.  Could it be that S&P, the guys who run that, if they were doing well during this other  thing, are unhappy with Obama and the way he's handling Wall Street?  Because he really has been kind of a prick to Wall Street. 
[00:18:30]  No, no, not conspiracy, but it's one company.  And is it possible, if these scumbags actually made money, and I mean by that any Wall Street  guys that knew things were happening and kind of went with it just to make money, so if  this fucking, this vulture mentality can make money when everybody's shitting the bed, is  it possible that they think this might be a good way to get rid of this guy?  To undermine.  Who has been a fucking nightmare.  Obama.  Well, it is, it has been.  For Wall Street.  It has been pointed out that some of the bigger of the Whigs over at the S&P were, and are 
[00:19:00]  very close friends with the Bush family.  So they're kind of getting that Republican tie-in where this could be politically motivated  to make Obama look really bad.  I don't know.  I would think that would come out at some point.  But no one would actually say in the room, okay, Sam, vote this way because we want him  to look bad.  Everybody just, it's just. 
[00:19:30]  It's just something that happens.  Yeah, like, you know, guys, I think it's going kind of rough, and they all know that Obama's  an enemy of Wall Street.  And the fact that there's three reporting companies, and the other two still have us at  AAA rated.  They're the only ones that knocked us down at AA+.  So that's good?  Yeah, but no one pays attention to the other two.  They're all panicking.  Well, they should start paying attention to those two.  Yeah.  They're all panicking at the one, but they look at the other two and be like, ah, movies.  Fuck it.  It's kind of like boxing.  Yeah. 
[00:20:00]  When they had more than one championship belt.  Right.  Yeah.  Unify the belts.  Yeah.  Unify the belts.  Those belts are important, too, no?  Ah, whatever.  Enjoy the ride.  It's pretty fucked up.  Obama's speech was great.  Because Obama said we're still a AAA rated country, so if Obama said it, it's got to  be true.  And at that point, the market dipped below 600.  No.  Or if it lost over 600.  It lost a little during his speech, and then the bloodbath happened late in the day. 
[00:20:30]  It did crack through the 11,000 mark when he was talking.  It rallied, and then it had a nice dip to close.  But don't you have trust?  I trust him more as a guy than I do.  But I mean, as a guy who's looking out for average people or regular people, then, well,  and again, I'm not saying that all Republicans are bad.  I don't mean that.  But the way they handled this fucking mess a couple years ago was disgraceful.  The banks gave nothing. 
[00:21:00]  They're just, I mean, I sound like Bill Burr, but I mean, it's the truth.  It's very hard to handle criminals when you're the government, and you've got companies that  are, they're acting like criminals.  They're giving, that whole thing where they were giving loans out to people that they knew  couldn't afford the loans, and then shorting the fucking housing market, knowing that it  was going to take a shit when all this happened, that's fucking criminal.  And what does a... 
[00:21:30]  What does shorting mean?  A government, that's betting that something's going to go down.  Okay.  That's betting that something's going to go down.  Was there argument that they were giving those loans because they were being forced to  and the government was guaranteeing the loans?  Like, they were saying, like, you have to give it to minorities and people that can't  afford it.  But so you give these loans that you know that they can't repay because we're telling  you to, but we will insure the loans.  No.  No.  I don't think so.  That's what Sam was saying before.  They really weren't involved.  I really thought I was right. 
[00:22:00]  They really weren't involved in that.  It was just one of those...  Fuck.  It was a weird time of just a lot of criminal behavior going on, and a lot of companies  paid, you know?  But now, though, I look at him, and I'm like...  Just fucking do something.  Do something.  Get up.  Make a speech.  I don't think he knows what to do.  I don't think anyone knows what to do.  I think he's lost.  He is really just a lost guy right now. 
[00:22:30]  He's had a rough presidency, man.  Yeah.  The economy.  He just cannot do anything because of the economy.  It's pulled him down.  It's all-encompassing.  It's just a quagmire.  You know what I don't understand, and I'll say it again, just going back to extreme basics.  Yeah.  I walked home yesterday.  People were doing their jobs.  So what's wrong with America?  Like, who the fuck is fucking this up?  Because we're not.  We're going to work. 
[00:23:00]  I see everyone working.  I don't see, like, campfires on the corners.  People warming their hands.  I don't see any shit going on.  55-gallon drums of flames, even though it's 90 degrees out.  But you know what I mean.  That just says people are poor.  They're just like, oh, boy.  You watch the news, though.  You would assume you would leave your house or leave your work and see some crazy shit going on.  You would see London, basically.  Yeah.  But no, man.  I walked all the way home, and people are hustling and bustling.  Hustling and bustling. 
[00:23:30]  And then you've got the tourists doing their shitty shit they do.  Nothing seems to be different out there.  Yeah.  But the people that we trust are fucking it up.  Now we'll see what happens, I guess.  Today?  Yeah.  You think it rallies?  I don't think it rallies.  No.  I think it goes down another couple hundred.  Because there doesn't seem to be any reason for it to rally.  You might start getting some people going like, meh, I might buy that.  That's pretty cheap these days.  Sure, you'll get some buying opportunities, possibly. 
[00:24:00]  But for it to be, really, for it to come out of this fucking, meh.  What's going on with London?  You follow Twitter, and it seems like it's the end of London, but.  It looks like fucking 28 days later.  Is it bad?  How bad is London?  Opportunistic hooliganism is what I heard.  It's not a real.  This thing started at first when a cop shot somebody.  And now that has nothing to do with why they're rioting.  Now, some group has said it's because of political economic cuts that they have made. 
[00:24:30]  And most of it is just opportunistic people bashing in stores and stealing stuff and setting shit on fire because it's cool.  And that's pretty much what's going on over there.  Do you think you're above that?  I'll be honest.  I'm not above that.  What?  I think I'm above that now because I have money.  But if I go back to the old version of me, where I was living paycheck to paycheck. 
[00:25:00]  I might grab a TV.  And shit was going down.  I'm not above that.  I'm here to admit I would be running in and getting something.  I'll tell you one thing I wouldn't be doing.  Look at that.  Jesus Christ.  I wouldn't be fucking hitting anyone over the head.  But if I saw someone break a storefront window in and it was a cool store, I'm not above that.  I'd be right there.  Wouldn't you?  Yeah, I guess it would all depend, too.  I like staying out of those scenes.  I'm seeing German shepherds and fucking riot gear cops. 
[00:25:30]  They're not doing enough, though.  They got their Captain America round shields, too.  They said that there were more police on the streets for the royal wedding than this.  Swear to God, that came out today.  And where was the mayor?  The mayor was on vacation?  Yeah.  Proving that the mayor does nothing in the end?  Yeah, they are worthless, aren't they?  I think so.  McDonald's has a mayor.  I think so.  McCheese.  The cops over there in England, I don't know.  They don't seem to know how to rack head really well. 
[00:26:00]  I see them making a line and pushing and pushing.  But they're getting pelted with shit.  They should just lay some of these motherfuckers out.  You rack some heads, and what happens?  Then the people go away.  They start going like, oh, my head racked.  Yeah, they had some videos yesterday.  I saw that poor fucking kid.  He's all bleeding.  He gets up, and some asshole just starts rifling through his backpack that's on his back.  Just a bunch of fucking cocksuckers. 
[00:26:30]  I wouldn't go that far.  Yeah, yeah.  I really wouldn't.  Would you throw something through a window, maybe?  No, no.  I probably would at one point.  I wouldn't be that guy, but if someone else did it, I would go, all right.  And you saw something good.  I would go inside.  I mean, they're carrying shit in a box.  It's like a TV right there.  I wouldn't hit anyone over the head or any of that shit.  No fucking way.  But the old me would absolutely take advantage of something like this.  Why this is going on so long is amazing.  How long has it gone?  Three days?  At least three days.  Maybe four now? 
[00:27:00]  Of some really heavy-duty shit.  The fire department can't even keep up.  Like, one fire starts.  They try to put it out.  They get pelted.  Look at this.  This guy's bleeding like a motherfucker.  We see him.  Now this guy helps him up.  He's like, hey, let me help you, man.  Hey, get up.  You okay?  Yeah.  Let me just, uh...  And this guy's like...  Going through his backpack.  Yeah.  He's going through his shit.  He feels something.  Now this guy sees that guy.  He's like, no, fuck that.  I'm going to go.  It's funny.  That's where black guys and white guys get together. 
[00:27:30]  Racial unity in London.  They're picking through a victim's backpack.  And the guy doesn't realize it.  And then he turns around and he's like, hey, what are you doing?  And then this guy just, like, takes this shit.  Humanity just sucks in the end.  Yeah.  What'd they take?  They just...  I don't know.  And then he just kind of...  A shirt or something out of that?  Like...  It's just fucking depressing.  Yeah.  Look at that.  Look at that.  The guy's blood is still on the street.  Oh, Christ.  Yeah.  They really are.  People are just terrible.  They really are.  That's why.  I'm not fucking bamboozled. 
[00:28:00]  I know shit as it is.  We're animals.  People are fucking animals.  And the second you just start trying to tell me different, look at some of this shit.  But we can act civilized every so often, put a nice suit on and talk civilly.  But the bottom line is, inside there is just a fucking animal.  Did you see the video of the woman's speech to rioters that has gone ridiculously viral?  And then I tried to listen to it.  I couldn't even understand what she was saying. 
[00:28:30]  Why?  Because of the accent?  Sam, go to TwitVid on Twitter.  It has one million views.  It was just a quick TwitVid.  It has 50,000 plus Facebook shares, 40,000 tweets.  And it's a woman's speech to the rioters.  And I guess this is like...  At least she's musical.  I like that.  The commercials.  TwitVids never get a million views.  Never.  Why is there a commercial before TwitVid?  Is there always?  Oh, well, this was a big one. 
[00:29:00]  They must have seen like, yeah.  They see people.  They're like, ah.  All right, tell me what's going on.  Well, it's a fun little part.  Come on.  It's a commercial for Mouthguards.  Oh, shit.  Your friends on Facebook help you decide.  Fish pumping.  You decide with your friends.  Enough with Bing.  If you're a fucking reality,  allow out the fucking bone in your property.  Allow out burning people's shop that they work hard to start their business.  You understand? 
[00:29:30]  Poor Harvey's not in shop there.  She's working hard to make her business work.  And then you don't want to go and burn it up for what?  Just to say that you're warring and you're a bad man.  This is about a fucking man who got shot in Tottenham.  This ain't about having fun on the road and bussing up the place.  Get it real, black people.  Get real.  In the middle.  I mean, I'm in the middle.  You're in for a cause.  If we're fighting for a cause,  let's fight for a fucking cause.  You lot piss me the fuck off.  I'm safe to be a happy person.  Because we're not all gathering together and fighting for a cause. 
[00:30:00]  We're running down Foot Locker and TV shoot.  30 T's one off.  Fuck.  That's pretty good.  It's hard to understand.  Hey, black people.  What the fuck are you doing?  She's West Indian.  She's about a man who got shot somewhere.  Yeah, it's supposed to be about, you know,  a guy that got shot.  And it's just about breaking into Foot Locker and grabbing sneakers.  Hey, look.  Me one time had to live in the United States with a fat man.  Me worked at Burger King and the man would lay on me. 
[00:30:30]  I know what you're feeling.  The man who got shot was a blessing in disguise.  Otherwise, he'd have had to move and live with a fat man who stutter.  The man say the same thing eight times in a row.  The man wafted and bought odor at me.  It smelled like a foot stuttering.  I said, just spit it out, but not in me direction, man.  Quit fighting everybody. 
[00:31:00]  It's like everybody run into a Foot Locker,  except for him because his feet are too fat.  Him have to get cloth little boats and put them on his feet.  It's supposed to be about a man who's stuttering and got shot.  Or at least everybody wish he did.  Very good.  Everybody wish he was doing the news.  Everybody wish a bullet would rip through him teeth.  True.  And land in the back of him, dumb, stuttering throat. 
[00:31:30]  A stutter, a stutter.  It's an ST, you big fat dummy.  Very good.  Big E.  Big E.  Big E.  I think we're going to have one of these in America.  Yeah.  Oh, fuck yeah.  If it happens in London.  A little anarchy to clean things up.  You think it'll be in Manhattan?  I hope not.  That'd be a fucking drag.  No, I think Manhattan police.  Oh, my God.  I don't think New York cops... 
[00:32:00]  Nah.  I don't see New York cops tolerate that shit.  I was talking to an officer yesterday about the situation,  and we were actually watching some videos from England.  And, yes, we were watching some hard videos.  Picture you and Keith with your pants trying to rankles,  and he still has his gun belt on.  You're both just jerking each other off, looking straight ahead.  He's got his fucking...  His cop blues around his knees.  You sure can paint a picture.  He's come on...  Every time you guide his cock towards the stomach,  he's like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,  because he's got the uniform shirt, 
[00:32:30]  and he doesn't want the clear spot,  the pre-cum spot on the front of his uniform.  He makes you point straight ahead of him.  I don't think that was happening, but...  Yeah.  But you could dream, Jimmy.  We're watching some videos.  The boy could dream, right?  That's just what I was thinking when I said.  Yeah, he should do it.  But he was saying, he goes,  is that...  That would never happen?  In New York, that doesn't happen.  All right, let me ask this.  What city is vulnerable for that?  Because it's going to happen.  Philly.  Philly.  I'd say Philly's ripe for it.  Those cops are fucking animals, too, though. 
[00:33:00]  I don't think...  Yeah, but they...  Philly cops don't play, brother.  Philly cops in the past have shown that they...  They don't fucking play.  Yeah.  They get pissed off quickly.  Philly people are, you know...  Yeah, I understand.  They're a little raucous.  How about Oak Town?  We've got to get a lame city.  Fucking Oakland.  What about San Francisco?  San Francisco?  I love San Francisco.  It's beautiful out there, but I think the people are lame.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Hmm.  They'll rise up.  I don't know. 
[00:33:30]  Maybe...  Who's going to rise up?  Boston?  Nah.  Boston cops are brutal.  Boston.  They'll fucking kill you if you're celebrating too hard after a Red Sox victory.  Crenshaw, bitches.  Crenshaw.  I think we'll...  How about Georgia?  Somewhere like in Georgia.  Somewhere like Atlanta.  I think we'll have a London situation within the next year.  St. Louis?  Yeah.  Somewhere like that.  Old St. Lou.  Well, that'll just improve the damn place.  Houston.  St. Louis is a disaster.  Yeah, it does stink, doesn't it?  It fucking blows. 
[00:34:00]  If I take the arches of something and put them in their pockets.  Just one arches.  You know, they don't allow black people like Cardinals games.  What?  Yeah.  I think that's illegal.  No, look it up.  It is.  Look it up.  Lou Brock was turned away recently.  Yeah, he was.  They wanted to honor him and they said, sorry, we don't allow blacks at the Cardinals games.  He wasn't even mad.  He was like, oh, that's right.  This is how stupid I am and I know I'm a fucking dummy.  I always assumed St. Louis was in an extremely white place because of Cardinals games.  Nah. 
[00:34:30]  I swear to God, though, when McGuire was doing his dumb thing with the home runs, I'm like, wow, this seems like a really white place.  But no, they're just all in the stadium.  Right.  Which means they don't allow blacks at the Cardinals games.  Look it up.  Oh, I never.  Sam, look it up.  I haven't found anything yet.  Well, keep looking.  All right.  I never dreamt.  Hmm.  I like how they're calling this Barack-alypse now.  Didn't Warren Buffett, I'm reading now in the paper, says that they're actually scrambling to defend themselves now, the S&P. 
[00:35:00]  Because Warren Buffett smashed them, too.  Yep, yep, yep.  And does he have more respect than they do in people's investors' eyes?  Yeah, yeah.  He's like the fucking guy to...  Yeah, Warren Buffett's got like...  He's got the fucking shit stocks.  The real good shit.  So when Buffett smashes them, if there's any business guy that could fucking do damage to them, it's him.  Yeah.  Or Jimmy Buffett.  One or the other.  What's he having?  Is he having margaritas? 
[00:35:30]  Margaritaville?  How about Detroit?  Yeah, D-Town.  D-Town, yo.  Come on.  You need a city that we still care about.  That's true.  If you're going to go with my bit.  St. Louis, we kind of care about.  We feel like we could save that city.  Detroit, we gave up on a while ago.  What are Chicago cops like?  I don't know, man.  You never really hear anything.  I don't know.  I assume the Chicago cops take massive dumps in the morning.  Yeah?  Yeah, that deep dish will fucking hurt you.  All that cheese has to come out, man. 
[00:36:00]  Cheese.  Fuck that.  Let's go to Chicago.  I'm going in the fall.  It's only fucking 20 below in the fall.  Well, I mean, the fall started yesterday for Chicago, so I'm going.  Let me say hi to Rick in El Paso, Texas.  Hey, Rick.  How's it going?  What's up, brother?  I'm tired.  But have you ever seen the movie Hot Rod about that fucking Daredevil dude? 
[00:36:30]  At the end of that movie, there's a riot scene.  Nice.  And one of the guys is like, they're all protesting against it.  This is not what we're here for.  And all of a sudden, his best friend shows up with a TV.  I just got it because it was there, bro.  That's what Oprah reminds me of.  I just got it because it was there.  Well, first of all, why would you watch Hot Rod?  Oh, we promoted it?  When did we promote Hot Rod?  We had a whole, actually, Hottest Rod contest.  Oh, really?  Oh, yeah.  Andy Samberg was in studio.  Was he good? 
[00:37:00]  Well, at the end of it, it was funny other than that.  No, I mean, was he good when he came in to promote the movie?  I don't even remember meeting the guy.  He was in, we had Jared the Fish Boy, Cream Pie Jones, and Little Hot Rod Underpants.  I don't remember any of this.  And I'm not even fucking joking.  I believe you.  You probably should have seen the movie.  Yeah, I don't remember that.  Did you see Hot Rod Ant?  No.  Yeah, we didn't see this Hot Rod movie.  A lot of people didn't.  All right, sir.  Thank you.  You know why Obama didn't rally anybody?  Because he wrote, Markets will rise and fall, but this is the United States of America. 
[00:37:30]  No matter what some agency may say, we've always been and always will be a triple-A country.  That's a nice thing to say, but there's not one ounce of, like you said,  it doesn't make you feel confident because it sounds like a coach pep rally speech instead  of anything concrete.  A plan.  And it's like, nobody wants to hear that shit right now, even though it's a nice sentiment.  It's like, yeah, we're in the U.S.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But tell me something.  Why is that wrong?  That's not a light at the end of the tunnel speech.  Can I tell you what bothers me about Obama? 
[00:38:00]  Because a lot of people think I'm like rah-rah Obama guy, and I'm really not.  But it frustrates the hell out of me that he just doesn't throw the script away.  Yes.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  And even if everything is always written for the president, because I don't know, but over  the years you always had a president that gave the illusion, at least, that he threw  the fucking script away, looked in that goddamn camera, and talked to America.  I haven't seen Obama talk to America yet.  I just haven't seen it.  Clinton, you absolutely saw him talk to America.  For the people that hate Bush, Bush absolutely talked to America when he had to, right? 
[00:38:30]  Yeah.  And I just have not seen that with Obama.  No, it's-  Every word seems calculated.  You know, like the thing Jimmy just read, it seems like one of those inspirational quotes  that mean nothing in the end.  Yeah.  We all have those inspirational quotes, right?  Yeah.  But you don't fucking ever do anything with it.  He needs something that will give the people the light at the end of the tunnel.  Some kind of plan where he can go, look, in the next year, here's what we're going to 
[00:39:00]  work on.  And not any of this bullshit.  See, what bogs him down is this fucking social program shit.  Like, lay off that for a minute, okay?  We understand.  You're a great guy.  You want to help the fucking downtrodden.  Oh, boy.  He wants to help the downtrodden by making everyone downtrodden.  How about you fucking have a plan?  Well, that would solve the problem, though.  It really would.  How about you have a plan and say, in the next year, here's what we are going to do.  We're going to cut spending by, and not just say we're going to cut spending. 
[00:39:30]  We're going to cut spending here, here, here.  This is what we're going to, here's how we're going to do it.  We're going to raise revenue by, we're revamping the tax code so that 51% of the country does  their share and pays fucking taxes.  51% of the country is not paying any taxes whatsoever, which is ridiculous when he's  sitting there crying that he can't get the Republicans and the Tea Party people to boost  taxes on the already overtaxed. 
[00:40:00]  He does not want, and the Democrats will never look at the 51% of the people that aren't paying  any tax.  Makes no sense.  You make fucking a dollar, 17 cents of it should go to the government.  I'm fine with that.  I'm fine with 17 or 20%.  17, 20%.  Yeah.  I don't like a progressive tax scale.  I fucking don't think it makes any sense.  It's unfair, and it just makes a class war.  That's what it does.  It makes people despise the rich because they have money, and it makes the rich despise the 
[00:40:30]  poor because they're not paying fucking taxes.  And I use those terms loosely because rich and poor, you know, very much.  Why don't you run for office?  I'm running for orifice.  Nice.  That's what I want.  I like that.  The ass.  Let me say hi to Mike in Vegas because he has something that's way more important than  the whole country falling apart.  Oh, could he?  Mikey, what's going on?  Mike?  What's up, boys? 
[00:41:00]  I'm out here halfway between Las Vegas and Los Angeles.  I'm actually from Orange County, New York, brought by the choppers.  Who asked you?  All right, all right.  Well, I got a question for Jimmy.  I'm dying here.  I met this chick, Jimmy.  Drop dead gorgeous.  I'm trying to bang this broad.  I'm telling you, man.  She's drop dead gorgeous.  She's rich.  She's actually, like, kind of sort of my boss at a new job I just got, and we started going  out and dating.  This is going to end well.  Find out that she just inherited, like, $23 million not long ago, and everything's going 
[00:41:30]  perfect, and getting all heavy.  We're about ready to hit it.  Herpes.  She fucking hits me with the herpes.  So, what's the problem, man?  What's the problem?  Fucking $23 million?  Throw the condom away and go, I love you.  Plow.  For $23 million, you should get your face right in there.  Yeah.  Really?  Fuck it.  Get herpes all over your fucking face.  Exactly.  Yeah, she's got, that's the thing.  She's got the whole lot of herpes, but she has it in the general area, and I really like  going down on her chick, and, uh...  You probably...  Just get it over with and get herpes yourself, and then you won't have a problem anymore. 
[00:42:00]  Yeah.  Dive in.  Just dive in.  Yeah, just dive in there.  I'm no doctor, bro, but I don't know if you can get...  If she was a shitty Perkins waitress and had no money in the bank, then maybe you should  fucking move on.  But $23 million?  Holy shit.  Can you get it like that?  I don't think you can...  She's gorgeous, too.  Sir, I don't know if you can, but I don't think that you can get genital herpes in your  mouth.  I mean, maybe you can, but I don't think it's very common anymore.  Any more, like, I don't think you can, or it's common to get the mouth herpes on the 
[00:42:30]  genitals.  I'm sure you can, I just don't think it's common.  See if she takes Valtrex and fucking lysine and stuff, does she?  $23 million for herpes.  I know that she has a couple of scripts.  I don't know exactly which ones.  She probably takes the right stuff, and she probably knows when it's going to come on.  Yeah, she says she can feel it like a week before.  She probably can, and at least she told you, dude.  Yeah, exactly.  What's your job?  My job?  I'm a truck driver.  And how much do you make a year? 
[00:43:00]  What do you do, character?  Like 60.  Yeah, you should get herpes.  Yeah, absolutely.  You should absolutely get herpes.  For $60,000 a year, with a chance to be a millionaire, you get herpes, sir.  Absolutely.  You get right in there.  You got it.  I'll call you back later, and I'll go.  Please call us when you officially have herpes.  That'll be a terrific bit for the show.  You got it.  I'll wear it like that down.  Thanks again, boys.  All right, Mikey.  You might not get it.  I mean, I know a guy who's been dating a girl for fucking, dating her for a while.  I had one girl who told me she had it. 
[00:43:30]  It freaked me out years and years and years ago.  But it's like, I know somebody who's dating somebody long term, and he's like, yeah, yeah,  she has it.  I'm like, really?  And what, do they got to be careful during her outbreaks?  I don't know.  I didn't get that detail, because it was his chick.  But I'm like, you're not worried?  He's like, no.  She's fine.  Damn.  And he doesn't have it.  It's like, all right.  You want a guy from London?  Yeah, let's...  We are a worldwide show now.  Let's see what's happening.  I did the math.  We have 10 listeners in every fucking country in the world. 
[00:44:00]  That's great.  Wow.  Yeah.  10 in each fucking country.  Joe in London.  Joe.  Hello?  Oh, man.  Hello?  Oh, fuck.  I got to deal with this accent.  Joe, what's up, buddy?  Oh, hi.  Hi, guys.  How are you?  Hey, how are you?  Good.  What's going on there?  Well, this morning, it sort of calmed down a bit.  People in my area have been involved in a bit of a cleanup.  But last night, it was fucking insane.  Really?  Yeah, like fireworks being shot at people's houses. 
[00:44:30]  And, like, the whole high street area where I live was just...  I walked through it.  I had to walk through it last night.  And, yeah, it was a bit of a zoo, basically.  And it's, like, what you see on the news is it doesn't quite give the full terror that  you get when you walk through it.  Yeah.  I mean, it's just pretty fucking insane.  Looks like the Blitz.  It does a bit, yeah. 
[00:45:00]  Yeah.  The Blitz.  Really?  Did you have to go into the tube?  No, I didn't use...  Everything was shut down.  Yeah?  Like, whole transport was shut down.  It was fucking insane, actually.  And it's, like...  It might be happening in Philly as we talk.  There's a teen curfew in Philly that just popped up on the news.  Ah, there you go.  Holy shit, you might be right at it.  Sorry, Joe.  So, it was insane, but you sound okay.  Is your house okay?  Is your neighbor's house okay?  Yeah, you get stuff thrown at them, but... 
[00:45:30]  Yeah.  It's sort of...  It was okay, mainly.  I mean, I don't live...  Mainly?  Mainly.  It's okay.  All right.  I know, I know, I know.  I've got an English accent, whatever.  How do you...  I know, I know.  Who gives a fuck about the riots?  How do you know about Opie and Anthony and Jim Norton?  I am a big Louis C.K. fan.  Ah.  And I heard, like, on YouTube, him on this show, and then started listening to your show that way. 
[00:46:00]  See, Louis helped us out.  Louis re-upped for a third season, by the way.  Well, it's not even done with his second season.  He's going to get a third.  They're going to give him four and five, too.  Oh, yeah.  Hold on.  We've got a guy calling from London, Joe.  Just stay in the line in case we need you.  Okey-doke.  Uh, who's this?  It's Chippa from London, this is...  How are things over there?  It's pretty good, but we're...  Everyone's having a riot, and I think everybody... 
[00:46:30]  What's that mean?  Is everybody laughing or something?  Everybody's throwing, like, crumpets around and stuff.  Crumpets?  Have you been involved in any of the looting and rioting yourself?  Yeah, I was rioting, because everybody was having a big laugh.  I was like, what is it, a big watch or something?  Jesus.  You're the guy going, oh, God.  It was like, and everybody was asking me if I wanted to have tea or something.  I was like, I'll have a little bit of tea, but don't go throwing no crumpets at me. 
[00:47:00]  English chip is just as bad as American chip.  It looks like we've got a glove and a half.  I was like, what is it, a big watch or something?  And they're like, no, it's Big Ben.  I was like, all the typical English things.  I was like, don't go throwing no crumpets in the Thames River or something.  Joe, is that what's happening? 
[00:47:30]  The Thames?  The Thames?  London Chip has given us a different picture, Joe.  Yeah, a bunch of queens or something running around.  I was like, yo, where's your crown?  And then Kate Middlebury is throwing, like, all the crumpets with everyone.  Yeah, you know what? 
[00:48:00]  Benny Hill music makes everything okay.  We should just throw that music behind the London...  Behind the riots.  The London riots.  Yeah, it wouldn't be as crazy looking.  Yeah, it'd be all right.  It'd be funny.  And then put it in slightly fast motion.  And get nurses with big bosoms.  Yeah, yeah.  With a few buttons undone.  Good idea.  Not bad.  Yeah, they would just suck their tits and bite them.  Oh, shit.  He always gets so nasty.  Jeez, what's that about?  Bite their tits and punch them in the face.  Wow, he's getting a little angry. 
[00:48:30]  Rotten oranges.  They just cock-tease you.  They make you low.  Hi, Chipper, how are you?  We'll take your temperature.  They just gotta grab their tits and bite them.  Wow.  Is that what you've been doing?  What's that?  I don't know.  What happened to the accent, London Chip?  No, it's right ears.  I was biting a nurse on her big milk titties.  I was gonna bite them and then push her in front of a big bin or something.  And then I was gonna call, like, the Queen of Wales or something. 
[00:49:00]  But then there was Prince Charles big ears.  And I was like, yeah, can you hear me or something?  We got the King of Wales running the board over here in the...  Sorry, E-Rock.  It's always an opportunity.  Yeah, that's a good one.  Oh, Chip.  I hope that he grabs his chest and falls. 
[00:49:30]  It just takes it to that level that it's just not fun anymore.  Oh, really?  I don't know.  Too real.  He's just playing there dying or something and we're all just laughing at him, kicking  him in the stomach.  Oh, that's what you get.  He's so mean.  I don't get it.  Oh, man.  Look at him.  Rioting.  I got a go at something.  Oh, okay.  London Chip.  He's got a go at something.  Yeah, London Chip.  Joe, what do you think of Chip's accent, by the way?  Spawn.  Spawn.  Spawn.  Spawn. 
[00:50:00]  All right, so it doesn't seem that bad, Jeff, is what you're telling us.  Well, not today, but it's very early there still, right?  No, it's late.  What is it?  It's 8, 9, 10, 11.  11 in the afternoon, probably.  Yeah, but it's not like rioting time, isn't it?  Isn't that like dusk?  Huh?  It's 11 in the morning.  What time is it?  11 in the morning.  I thought you guys were six hours ahead of us.  No, no, no.  Four.  No.  I thought it was six hours, too, actually.  I really did.  Who's six hours away?  I really thought it was six hours.  Yeah, we thought it was six hours. 
[00:50:30]  It's only four.  Moscow.  Moscow.  All right, Joe.  Yeah, Germany.  We're keeping you on the line because you're calling from really far away, I think.  I'm going to jack the phone a little.  If you were from, like, Newark, New Jersey, we would have got rid of you a long time ago.  I understand.  But, I mean, you know, he's there and it's happening, and he's basically saying that everything's  fine now.  So that's good.  Did you take any pictures with your phone?  No, I did not.  You sure?  I was probably terrified of when I was walking through the blitz, as you called it. 
[00:51:00]  Yes, the blitz.  The blitz, yes.  It was like, it was almost like the zoo had just, like, broken out, if anything.  It was just, it was fucking insane.  They were, like, do you have, like, bookies, you know, like, where you place bets?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Over here, I don't know if it's legal in New York, but they have, like, massive, like, 
[00:51:30]  plasma screens.  And as I was walking through, it's like, it took, like, five people ripping plasma screens  from bookmakers.  And, like, I saw, like, groups of, like, three teenagers or whatever, like, carrying massive  plasma screens, like, straight out, like, with the boxes.  Yeah, oh, they love those TVs when they're looting.  Looting has gotten much easier, too, these days with the flat screens.  They're so light and easy to carry.  Like, it's not like those big, giant CRT televisions, you know? 
[00:52:00]  Oh, wow.  You know, the big, giant TVs that were very heavy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It really does make it easier to grab a TV.  It really does.  You know?  You just need a couple buddies to get a TV out of the store.  Now it's so easy.  Now you put one under your arm and jump on the...  The underground.  The underground.  Yes.  The tube.  The tube.  The tube.  And then get it to your flat. 
[00:52:30]  Right.  Your flat.  By using a lift, I think.  Yeah.  Just call it an elevator.  The lift.  All right, Joe.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  Thanks, Joe.  All right.  Bye.  I love all the people around the world that on Twitter are just tweeting,  pray for London.  For what?  Why?  I don't know for what.  Don't you think God already knows?  He knows what's going on.  He knows what's going on.  And if he's the guy that is in charge of everything, he's the one that's doing it.  What is your prayer going to do? 
[00:53:00]  I hate that shit.  I really do.  You thought about it for two more seconds.  It got all angry.  Fuck.  And then stupid Justin Bieber.  He writes, pray for London.  And then it gets retweeted a million times.  What is that doing?  What does that do, Ed?  What is he doing not fucking Selena Gomez for the time it takes to tweet?  There were rumors.  So he awkwardly mauled her at the Teen Choice Awards.  Did you see that?  Really? 
[00:53:30]  They are so not a fucking couple.  That Selena Gomez wants a fucking man that knows what he's doing, man.  Let's come over here.  Get a real man.  I'll show you a real man.  He looks like a lesbian.  He really looks like...  Justin Bieber looks like a lesbian.  Yeah.  He really does.  And you got that Selena Gomez that now she's letting her bikini slip off her body a little  bit here and there.  Yeah.  Justin Bieber doesn't know what the fuck to do with that.  She's showing the sexy.  But what does this pray for London mean? 
[00:54:00]  It's infuriating.  They want you to pray so things get better.  People stop fighting.  Oh, my God.  Come on.  Exactly.  Look at him grabbing that ass.  He's trying to make himself look like, yeah, I know what to do with this.  He has no fucking idea.  Look at that.  What you do with that.  Are these the latest pictures on whatwithtylardurndu.com?  They're from May.  Oh, those are from May.  This is what you do with that. 
[00:54:30]  From fucking head to toe.  Is that him grabbing her ass?  Give her a tongue bath.  Dude, he's scooping her ass home.  Oh, he really is.  But he doesn't know what he's doing.  You think he has a boner there?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  How do you know?  He's got a big boner.  Well, used to.  He probably came in his little fucking surfer shorts.  She looks like she has kind of a big one, too.  I've seen a couple of camel toe shots of her.  Oh, yeah.  Boy.  Her first name, last name Gomez, she's got a big one.  I don't know.  Spanish chicks, to me, American Indian chicks always have big pussies. 
[00:55:00]  Native American chicks always have big pussies.  Yeah, but they're purple.  They are, right?  I guess that they're 100%.  Look at that.  You're trying to tell me he knows what to do with that.  Get the other ass out of here.  Is her ass flat, though?  No.  You're going to be asking me, popping up.  That's just a weird shadowing that's going on there.  But, wow.  Yeah, that'll derail a fucking program in a second.  You keep popping those fucking pictures up.  I'm going to have to go to the bathroom and jank off.  Vincent Bayonne writes, hope he's so angry about kind sentiment. 
[00:55:30]  No, I hate these people that just go pray for London.  It means nothing.  What does that even mean?  Get on a fucking plane, go over there, and try to figure some shit out.  Try to, you know, stop the looters.  Because when you see, like, pray for London, this is why it bothers the fuck out of me.  There's shit going on in this world that is way worse than pray for London.  Oh, yeah.  So why are we all focusing our prayers on London when maybe some other parts of the world need me, quote, pray way more? 
[00:56:00]  Some fucking dark, dank corner of the globe where some woman's clit is being taken out with a little spade shovel.  Exactly.  Yeah.  I bet she wants some prayers.  That's why it bothers me.  London could handle itself.  I say release the Haynes.  Let the dogs out on them.  They got those cool fucking riot German Shepherds.  Just unleash them and let them fucking start ripping some of these guys' fucking arms off.  The English are all like, well, get the fire out and get these people in line. 
[00:56:30]  There's a German Shepherd in my building.  Yeah.  Aren't those great dogs?  No, man.  It's my number one dog that I fear.  Really?  Yes, I'm telling you.  And this thing was in the elevator with me and it just fucking shuts me the fuck up.  Really?  Yeah.  And this thing looks so intimidating.  I had to ask the doorman.  I'm like, is that a police dog?  I think it's a police dog.  It doesn't look like it's a German Shepherd pet.  You rarely see German Shepherd pets anymore. 
[00:57:00]  They usually are just kind of used for security and whatnot.  Yeah.  This thing looked like if you looked at it the wrong way, it doesn't matter what fucking word the owner knows.  You're in deep trouble.  I still don't like pit bulls.  I just...  Is that your number one dog?  Yeah, I don't really...  What do you fear?  I'm not really afraid of dogs because I really don't have that much contact with them.  And if, you know...  But that's your number one?  Yeah, that would be the one that I would think would do the most damage at the drop of a hat and just out of nowhere just lunge for your fucking throat. 
[00:57:30]  Can we ask Michael Vick if there's a German Shepherd in a pit bull?  Who wins?  I think the pit bull fucking kicks ass on the Shepherd.  Really?  It's got that fucking jaw like a great white.  Does anyone know the answer to that?  They've got that jaw muscle.  They're made for fighting.  They've got that little stocky thing.  I would put my money on a German Shepherd.  Nah, I think the pit bull fucking destroys a Shepherd.  Really?  Shepherds are too thin.  They've got thinner legs.  You could take a Shepherd down a lot easier than you could.  By the way, someone's saying that London guy was retarded. 
[00:58:00]  It is a six-hour time difference.  My whole life, I thought it was a six-hour time difference.  They're just playing.  There's a video, Pitbull vs. German Shepherd on YouTube.  It's an adorable couple of puppies just romping in a driveway.  It's like the Little Archies.  That's the cutest.  It is like the Little Archies.  Are you just driving me nuts, girl?  It's the Little Archies.  Do you like Little Archies?  Are they adorable little puppies playing? 
[00:58:30]  Stop.  Stop.  And the pit bull's just owning, though.  Yeah, I want to know.  I want to know what dog wins.  German Shepherd or Pit Bull?  Pit Bull.  It says Pit Bull.  I don't know if that's a guarantee yet.  I think Pit Bull owns.  You think?  Yeah.  Very aggressive.  Well.  They're built for fighting.  German Shepherds aren't.  Now he's sucking his dick.  He's licking his dick and now he's humping him.  Dogs are so weird when they greet each other.  How you doing?  Smell your ass.  It's great.  What's even stranger? 
[00:59:00]  Is the owners just stand there and allow it to happen?  What happened?  There's a German Shepherd now on a leash.  Yeah.  And a little baby, really little baby Pit Bull has his teeth on the leash.  And the German Shepherd's just dragging him along the beach.  Wow.  It's adorable.  Everyone is calling in.  Man, holy shit.  No one gave a shit about the Stock Mart, get the London riots, but they care about the  German Shepherd versus Pit Bull.  Oh, hell yeah.  Let's say hi to Tim in Connecticut.  Tim.  Good morning.  How you doing?  Pretty good, man. 
[00:59:30]  Hello.  I had a neighbor who had a female Pit Bull.  And the dog got out, went to the other neighbor's house, started attacking the dog.  There happened to be two cops sitting in front of the house because we had a tree fall down  after a storm.  Anyway, the two cops got out.  Both cops pulled out their tasers, stuck their tasers into the Pit Bull, and the Pit Bull  kept going.  Did not fade him one bit.  It's unbelievable.  The strength in that dog is unbelievable.  That's crazy.  All right.  I don't like that Pit Bull.  But I want to know German Shepherd versus Pit Bull. 
[01:00:00]  That's what we're really looking for today.  You've got to go with the Pit Bull.  I'm going German Shepherd.  Man, that's crazy.  Why don't we get a live event together?  This would be awesome.  Oh, yeah.  Tom.  Yeah, they say the German Shepherd has more pounds per square inch of biting power than  the Pit Bull does.  I don't know if that means anything or if it would win.  What?  How does that work?  I don't know.  That's why they use them for police dogs.  Because they're badass.  No, they use them for police dogs, too, because they're trained easier. 
[01:00:30]  They're bigger.  They can run faster, probably.  Yeah.  And they're way more intimidating than a Pit Bull.  And over the years, they've been trained to be guard dogs and such.  So it's kind of in the breed.  I don't think so.  I would dispute that pounds per square inch on the jaw.  Well, can we Google that shit?  Yeah, because I saw yesterday, I forget what paper it was, because they were, you know, 
[01:01:00]  defending the Pit Bull and they were just stating all the other breeds that they say  had more biting power than the Bull and all that bullshit.  More biting power.  I don't know.  That jaw on a Pit Bull is fucking amazing.  Yeah, no doubt.  And giant fucking crazy jaws.  Yeah, I fear both of them, so.  Well.  All right, sir.  Thank you.  Thanks.  No, I don't know.  I think he's a little mad, but I don't know.  Work that kennel.  Pit Bull would kill the German chef because it won't stop. 
[01:01:30]  Let's go to Mike in Harrisburg.  Mikey.  Yeah, how you doing, guys?  Hey.  Yeah, Pit Bulls and Rottweilers are pretty much cut from the same cloth that once they  start fighting, they will not stop unless they're killed, basically.  You've got to put them down because they just will not stop.  You know, that's why Pit Bulls and Rottweilers are feared because they just have that  killer instinct.  They won't stop when they start.  That's not true.  He's got to slap them and go.  Yeah, that works.  I saw that.  I saw that. 
[01:02:00]  Anthony, I got the perfect dog for it.  It's called a Caucasian Mountain Dog.  It's known as the most vicious dog on the planet.  They're enormous and even, you know, more tenacious than even a Pit Bull or Rottweiler.  So they...  Why would I want that?  Let me see what this looks like.  Oh, my God.  That's a horse.  That looks too adorable.  A big furry horse.  How is that the most vicious dog on the planet?  Oh.  They bond to one owner and the owner and their property.  Then they defend that to the death.  And they're enormous.  They average around 200 pounds. 
[01:02:30]  Holy shit.  That's a big ass dog.  It's like a bear.  Yeah.  It's great.  Wow.  It's like a bear.  And where are these dogs?  Well, I think the Russian army used to train them.  But there's only a handful of breeders in the country because they're just so uncontrollable.  And they bond to one owner and anybody else that comes around, that dog will...  Holy shit.  That is a bear.  But there's too much hair.  You know how much shit that thing must track in the house?  It just logs of shit.  Yeah, that's a pain in the ass dog.  That dog's arm or whatever the leg, whatever the fuck, sorry. 
[01:03:00]  Paw.  Paw.  No, that whole fucking thing.  It's bigger than that guy's thigh.  If you get some videos of it, those things are fucking amazing.  Yeah.  Can you get a video of this?  I've never seen this dog before in my life.  I've never heard of it.  Nah.  Does it bark when people come over?  Oh, yeah.  I mean, there's only a handful of breeders because nobody can control these animals.  It's amazing.  I've never heard of one of these.  Do they eat their owners?  Yeah.  I mean, they say they...  I've only experienced one in person, but they say they bond to that one owner. 
[01:03:30]  And beyond, you know, after that, anybody else is pretty much a target.  All right.  We're going to look at a video here of the Caucasian...  What is it called again?  I think Caucasian.  Caucasian Mountain Dog?  Mountain Dog.  Holy shit.  Oh, it's a musical montage of photos.  The Caucasian Mountain Dog.  That's a big...  That's a very pretty dog.  Yeah.  I want to see...  I want to see this thing in action.  We need an actual video.  Yeah.  Whoa.  That looks pretty vicious right there.  Look.  That's a fucking monster.  That is a big dog. 
[01:04:00]  That isn't a dog.  That's a big monster.  It's too fucking furry.  Man, get one of these, man.  Fuck that noise.  No.  You know, ant parties would suck.  Those big dogs running around biting everybody.  Everybody's in the pool just afraid.  Yeah, things carry an ant's gun in its mouth.  Rotten dog fucking shitting all over the fucking town.  Trying to walk in there and sing karaoke.  There's a big doody by the stage.  Big liquidy doody.  They're showing an attack.  Oh, fuck. 
[01:04:30]  The guy's got it on a leash, though.  That's all shit.  It's all music instead of actual audio.  Why would you allow that dog to...  Is it punching him in the face?  No, he's trying to pull away.  Oh, he's got a big...  That thing has a lock on that guy.  Oh, and they got a line on the dog, too.  Yeah.  So they can pull him back if he gets too crazy with his...  He's biting the guy's...  He's biting.  The arm pad.  The power in that fucking dog is crazy.  And this is definitely the most dangerous dog in the world, Mike? 
[01:05:00]  That's what they say, yeah.  Did you notice that?  I never heard of this dog, man.  Yeah.  Yeah, not many people have, because there's only a few breeders that can even handle him.  That's not true, though, because there's something called an Albanian jumping dog.  Jumps up, gets you.  But beyond that, I figured that's perfect for Anthony being Caucasian and all.  No.  I'm getting one of these.  Get me a breeder.  In New York?  Fuck yeah.  Yeah, right?  That's a good apartment dog.  I see a lot of assholes every day, man.  I need one of these dogs.  Dude, he would drag a log of shit into the apartment, and you'd be done with them. 
[01:05:30]  You'd have to, honey, get the scissors, you'd have to cut the fur because there's a dried  log of shit, and he's sitting on the sofa trying to play Tiger Woods golf in his big  fucking giant shitty dog feet right in your lap.  You're like, all right, wait for me.  Mike, you're our expert.  Stay in the line.  I might need you.  Big tics.  We're going back to Artie in Jersey.  Artie.  Yeah.  Artie Murphy, my man.  No, not really, but.  Okay.  We know.  No, as far as the pit bulls and German Shepherds go, most reason why they use the German Shepard 
[01:06:00]  as a police dog is because a pit bull isn't inherently aggressive towards humans.  So that's one of the main reasons why they don't use a pit bull as a guard dog.  Where's the German Shepard is, right?  Here's Mr. Pit Bull Guy.  I know.  I love pit bull guys that just defend pit bull.  Of course.  I hate.  Defend them to the fucking hills.  I hate people that defend their favorite breed.  I see the stupid greyhounds. 
[01:06:30]  Those damn things are meant to run.  Stop trying to make them a fucking pet in your one-room apartment in Manhattan.  Yeah, well, they're, you know.  They look miserable.  Take the leash off and let them run down Broadway.  That's what they want to do.  Pit bulls want to fucking eat things.  No, they don't.  They really don't.  It's people who make them want to eat things.  Any dog wants to eat things.  They're animals.  But it's how you raise it.  It's how you train it.  So why did the pit bull get the reputation for being a vicious motherfucker of a dog? 
[01:07:00]  In the 70s, German Shepherds had that reputation.  In the 80s, Dobermans had that reputation.  Well, they did, yes.  You know, 90s, Rottweiler had that reputation.  Now pit bulls are in the forefront with that reputation.  And it just seems that any time there's somebody hurt, they automatically call it a pit bull when it doesn't necessarily have to be a pit bull.  It could be basically any dog that attacks now is a pit bull.  Yeah.  All right.  I'll still cross the street if I see a pit bull coming. 
[01:07:30]  I'm not going to trust you that they're all friendly.  They're not all friendly, but it's mainly because the owners are ass.  It's not because of the dogs.  Most of the owners suck.  Well, that's true, yo.  You know, and 99% of the people suck.  So, you know.  So you're trying to tell me, name a dog that is so innocent and so friendly.  Give me one.  Because I don't know dogs.  Yorkshire?  A little Yorkie?  No, Yorkie is a nasty little nippy fucking dog. 
[01:08:00]  They're worse than pit bulls.  All right.  Give me a dog then that no one would even think.  A schnoodle?  A schnoodle, yeah.  All right.  You're trying to tell me that a schnoodle could be an evil fucking dog because the owner's an asshole?  Mr. Balutagilly.  Because if you beat a dog, if you hit a dog, any dog could turn nasty.  Go to the retriever.  You don't think of them as nasty dogs.  They're friendly.  Pit bulls are nasty by nature.  I'm sorry.  I think there are certain dogs that are more docile and certain dogs that are more aggressive.  Right.  What is that?  Regardless of.  You know what the dogs that bite the most are? 
[01:08:30]  I think I know.  Is it a beagle?  Let me guess.  I got one.  All right.  The motherfucking poodle.  Yeah.  I mean, they're all those dogs.  They look silly, but they are vicious dogs.  Is it a clitschnauzer, sir?  Gotta watch it.  He nips.  The clitschnauzer's very rough.  I'm gonna go with the hot dog.  All my aunts and uncles while I was growing up constantly had these dumb poodles named like Peppy and stuff.  Look out for Peppy.  He nips.  Yeah, they do.  He nips.  And it was like, no, that's, he bites. 
[01:09:00]  The dog bites, you dummy.  Were they mini poodles or big ones?  They were like the big poodles.  Big poodles are fine.  No, they're passive aggressive assholes.  Are they?  Yeah, they don't bite you.  They just nip.  A stoodle.  Nip, nip, nip, nip.  Mr. Balutigan.  A stoodle.  Artie, what dog bites the most?  Dalmatians and Cocker Spaniel.  Those are the two dogs that are biting them.  Dalmatians, really?  Dalmatians, yeah.  Because Dalmatians, they're interbred so much. 
[01:09:30]  And people buy them for their kids because they're a stupid fucking movie.  Oh, right, right.  They wind up losing it, biting the kid, and then, you know, finish the dog's fault.  I got 101 of them, something.  Why would anyone own a slobber dog?  I just call them slobber dogs.  There's a few of them.  I guess the St. Bernard is one.  Oh, that's the worst.  The dog's riding a bike.  He's riding a fucking bike.  The dog's riding a bike.  That's impossible.  Oh, that's great.  His stupid red dog dick is leaking all over the seat. 
[01:10:00]  Why is the dog riding a bike?  It's incredible.  It is incredible.  That is amazing right there.  That's incredible.  We just watched Dalmatian riding a bicycle on YouTube.  You know that dog has no soul if the owner got it to ride a bike.  I hope his legs were broken and stiffened with a board and tied to the fucking pedals.  Let's talk about slobber dogs.  Why would you ever have one of those things?  Dude, I don't know.  They're disgusting.  Just their saliva is on everything in your house.  Spit on everything in your house. 
[01:10:30]  No fucking way.  Smells like wet dog every time you go in someone's house like that.  Do bulldogs slobber a lot?  Yeah.  Yeah.  They do, right?  Is yours?  The St. Bernard.  Sometimes.  When he's hungry.  Look at the fucking skateboarding dog.  You got a bulldog?  Oh, that's right.  I know that.  I know.  The dog just skateboards.  No, he doesn't skateboard.  This dog is skateboarding, man.  He's loving life.  He's turning.  Tillman's the best.  Holy shit.  He rocks.  Who's Tillman?  That dog?  He's hanging 10.  How do you know that?  His name is Tillman. 
[01:11:00]  Tillman's very famous.  17 million views.  17 million views.  Everyone knows Tillman.  French Poodle?  Where have you been?  You're too busy watching beheading videos when you can watch fucking skateboarding dogs.  I'd rather watch the same.  I'd rather watch them combined.  You know how great fucking Tillman's head would look being fucking held by Al-Qaeda?  A la Akbar.  Artie, fair enough.  You got to defend the pit bull.  I understand.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  All right, guys.  Thanks for your phone call.  All right.  Norwegian bear dogs.  They attack bears. 
[01:11:30]  Can you?  I want to see a Norwegian bear dog.  Stop biting me.  Jeff in Jersey.  Hey, what's happening, guys?  Hey, man.  Hey, there's a...  Yeah, they're bred in cold weather climates like Alaska and Canada.  They're used to chase down bears and keep bears away from the family.  They're little short stocky fucks.  Now, let me look at this.  Let me see if I'd be scared of this fucking thing.  I think he means Norwegian elk hound.  Oh, and look at that.  He's just chasing a bear.  Holy shit.  Oh, shit.  That bear's standing the fuck up. 
[01:12:00]  Yeah.  Bear's holding its ground.  That dog sucks at chasing bears.  Yeah, yeah.  He's chasing a bear.  He looks back at his owner like, you really want me to do this?  You didn't train me good enough.  I think it's scary.  Shit.  I think it's scary as fuck.  It's like when you're arguing with a guy and you go, let me go, and your friends let  you go, and then you're like, oh, buddy, I wanted you to hold me.  Yeah, you weren't supposed to actually let me go, you idiot.  Yeah.  All right.  Watch it out.  Thank you, sir.  All right.  We should take a break.  Enough with this dog shit.  That dog shit. 
[01:12:30]  Everyone's saying the pit bull would beat the German Shepherd answer.  I think you might have won that.  Yeah, I think.  German Shepherd has a stronger draw.  No, it doesn't.  That's why I came in.  Yeah?  It doesn't.  Doberman has the strongest draw.  No, it doesn't.  Yes, it does.  Doberman's scarier than pit bulls in my life, too.  I'll go German Shepherd and then Doberman.  Doberman, Mastiff.  I forget what it is.  Pit bulls just lock, right?  Yeah.  I don't believe it.  But the German Shepherd has a stronger draw than pit bull.  I took a...  Small, cute kitten, 14 million fucking... 
[01:13:00]  You mean how much that must hurt on your fingers?  Ah, those little fucking pin...  I took a German Shepherd bite to the side of my knee growing up, and that's why, to this  day, fuck German Shepherds, man.  Remember that cop had a German Shepherd up here?  Yeah, I was horrified.  I was trying to be cool, but I...  Oh, I love it.  German Shepherds fucking horrify me.  What's your number one dog you're scared of, Travis?  I'm not scared of any.  You know what?  Honestly, like little dogs, like little shitty Yorkies that just, like, bark and...  Are you scared of them?  No, I'm not scared of them, but I hate them the most. 
[01:13:30]  I'm not scared of any dog I can...  I'm not scared of any dog.  I could kick and it's going to actually fucking...  Right.  I love big dogs.  I love Mastiffs and Rottweilers.  Pit bulls are scary, though, because if they decide to fucking bite you, there's too many  cases of them being trained poorly and biting people.  Sure, but I'm not going to...  They really fuck you up.  I'm not just going to go up to a dog.  Like, if I see a dog on the street that I want to say hi to, which sometimes I do because  they're cute, I'll ask if I can say hi.  Oh.  That's a creep.  You don't just go up to a dog.  What a creep.  Can I say hi to your dog?  Yeah, you know, sometimes, you know, you're walking around and you're like, oh, look at 
[01:14:00]  that cute French bulldog.  I don't see a lot of...  That happened to me once.  I said, excuse me, sir, does your dog bite?  And he said, no.  So I pet him and he bit me and I said, sir, I thought you said your dog doesn't bite.  Probably wasn't his dog.  You ruin everything.  If that wasn't Vaughnvillian, we're taking the act on the road.  But Chip does it without an ounce of irony. 
[01:14:30]  No, no.  It's to be aggressive because he doesn't like the story.  But he doesn't know that that's the punchline.  Of course not.  He just thinks he's being a smart.  Oh, Chip.  You guys want inside info on Pitbull versus German Shepherd?  This guy used to fight dogs.  We don't condone this activity.  I would never fight a dog.  They'd probably bite your knuckles.  Dave, you used to fight dogs.  Dave.  Hey, yeah.  Hey.  You used to fight dogs?  Yeah, we used to.  Well, we'd all fight our dogs. 
[01:15:00]  Right.  All right.  I guess that's the end.  Okay.  And?  Are you...  Hello?  Yes, sir.  You're on the radio, sir.  I don't want to get...  I'm on the radio?  I don't want to get to know a guy that fights dogs, but we need you today, so tell me what's  going on.  Well, we used to...  We have these keggers right outside of my town, and all of us would get drunk and fight  our dogs.  We'd have Pitbulls, Rottweilers, and German Shepherds. 
[01:15:30]  I want to party with you.  That story you told about fighting with your dog?  How about the Alaskan Halibut Mutt?  There isn't one.  I didn't fight with my dog, Stupid.  The dog...  I can't believe you just called it Stripes.  I'm amazed by that.  Holy shit.  Where did that come from?  Oh, it's a Shih Tzu with shoes on.  He'd get out for the first few minutes, and then he'd get tired. 
[01:16:00]  He's trying to get those shits on his feet.  We're too busy looking at cute dogs.  Sam is just popping up video after video of an adorable dog.  He's walking like someone with palsy.  Is that always funny?  He's got these yellow shoes on, these little booties, and he doesn't like walking with  them at all.  He thinks it's horrible.  That's why they should walk him outside, so they don't step in a little bit of glass.  Yeah, it could hurt them.  That's what I would walk a dog with, little booties.  I saw a dog video to this day.  I guess I'll bring it up today.  It horrified me, and it brought me to tears. 
[01:16:30]  Oh, no.  Yeah.  What happened?  Are you guys going to ask me questions?  No!  Are you going to ask me questions?  Why haven't you shot yourself?  We don't really like people that fight their dogs, man.  We'd all get drunk and fight our dogs.  Ah, we heard.  How many of you guys get drunk and fight each other?  Fight each other.  It's awful.  What would you do with the dogs?  What would we do with them?  Yeah.  We'd bring them to keggers, and then they'd sit in the back of our trucks, and then we 
[01:17:00]  just start talking shit, and we'd find them up, and they'd fight.  That's an ugly dog.  That's my dog.  It's horrible.  Ugly dog.  What's that?  Every other dog video has two and a half million views.  Travis's has 5,000.  Oh, what happened there?  It sucks.  Yeah, look at that dog.  What a shitty dog.  It just goes to his house.  12,000.  All right, I'm checking out.  I'll see you on the 19th, Jimmy.  Take care, brother.  Oh, he's going to be on your show.  Nice.  See you there, man.  Thank you.  Jimmy would love to know more about you guys fighting your dogs, so make sure you see Jimmy  after the show and talk to him about it.  Yes, tell me while I'm selling merchandise again. 
[01:17:30]  I don't even know if this video is still on YouTube, but there was a video that was up  there for a while, and it was the cutest dog you'll ever see.  I swear this brought me to tears.  I don't even want to bring it up on the air, but fuck it.  And these little fucking kids were encouraged to light it on fire.  What?  On YouTube?  Yes.  Did they do it on YouTube?  And then people are begging, leave this video up.  It needs to be seen.  What's going on out there?  And then I can't even talk about it. 
[01:18:00]  What happened?  It was one of those, I never thought I'd be so affected by something in my life.  Why would you watch that?  I don't, I didn't, I kind of got invested in it.  I clicked on it.  Some asshole, I think, tweeted it, and then I did watch it, and I was deeply depressed.  It was a small dog or a big dog?  The cutest dog you'll ever see.  They fucking like this damn thing, and they're all laughing as this dog is being burned alive  as it's running all over the fucking place.  It was the most horrifying thing I've ever seen, ever, ever. 
[01:18:30]  I wouldn't watch that.  I've seen that with a cat in a cage, and the sounds of me were horrible.  I avoid shit like that, but for some reason it got me, and I was in, and I was like, holy shit.  I couldn't watch that.  I couldn't watch, and supposedly it's happening in some just fucking savage country, and they  think it's hilarious.  They think it was fucking hilarious.  Well, they probably have no value for human life, so a dog's life is even more worthless.  That's nothing.  And this thing was just fucking running and crying and begging.  I mean, you could tell it was just begging, like, please, you know. 
[01:19:00]  They do it to people.  I've seen footage of people being burned alive.  Travis is such a fag.  He's looking at his own dog videos and laughing hysterically.  He can't catch french fries?  No, it just hit his face.  He's an idiot.  I'd like to see him try that, but not with french fries, with fucking police batons and  bats.  Fucking M80s, lit M80s.  Hopefully he can catch one and swallow it.  The video's still up there.  Really?  Mm-hmm.  That's crazy.  Where is it?  Look it up.  I didn't see it.  It was a dog on fire. 
[01:19:30]  No, it's this.  Google Bark Ouch.  I don't even want to give the fucking name.  Bark Ouch.  Bark Ouch.  Appropriate title.  I don't even know why we're doing this.  This was the most horrific thing I've ever seen.  Okay.  Because I do avoid all this shit.  I told you, I used to go to this one site, and the only, I've watched, I could watch so  many horrible things.  Yeah, I actually, oh, wow, Travis is pumping out.  I don't want to watch it either. 
[01:20:00]  I'm having another issue with fucking YouTube, but they allow this video to stay up there.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  You know, they fucking banned another one of my videos for just nonsense, but they allow  this to stay up there.  Ew.  I don't want to watch.  No, no.  I'm telling you, I don't even want to give out the URL.  I'm just acknowledging that this was the worst thing I've ever fucking seen.  Yeah.  I can't watch animal stuff.  There's obviously, people on fire.  There's obviously worse, but this thing, but I don't, I don't, I don't look at any of 
[01:20:30]  that stuff.  Look, Travis left.  I'm telling you.  Travis ran out of here.  It brought me to fucking tears.  I had fucking teary eyeballs.  I was like, holy shit, humanity blows.  Watching a guy burned alive is horrible, but you have to know, at least he probably did something  I'm not saying that that's right, but he did something that annoyed the other people.  The dog, you know.  What country was this from?  Does anyone know?  Arabic kid burns a dog to death for fun.  That's what it is.  For fun.  Arabic.  It doesn't matter.  You get that here.  Some Middle Eastern savage nation.  You get that here down south or in Boston. 
[01:21:00]  Anywhere.  There's fucking kids that have bad parents.  The way to do that, even though he's a kid, is you should probably break both his legs.  So I would love to, I would love to ask YouTube, why?  Why is that still up there?  Yeah, but you know, you're fucking banned dumb videos that people are making.  Innocent videos.  This is just beyond horrific and has no educational value whatsoever, but that one's still up there.  No.  Making me hungry, though.  I gotta eat.  All right, yeah, we should take a break.  Wow, we didn't even click on it. 
[01:21:30]  Look at that.  I'm telling you, man.  I don't want to watch it.  No way.  I'm telling you, man.  That one fucking, it took a piece of my soul, I'm telling you.  That one took a piece of my fucking soul.  I can't watch the animal things.  They make me, there's really very rarely, even on the terrible sites, you don't see the horrible things happening to kids.  Like a little bit here and there, like a car accident, but you don't see a lot of that.  I can't watch that shit.  Oh, yeah.  And I can't watch animals.  And everyone's begging for the URL.  If you really need to see this, you'll find it yourself.  I don't want to be the person that fucking gives that out and gets people really depressed. 
[01:22:00]  Because a lot of people will fucking be extremely depressed after they see that.  I'm telling you, it's that bad.  The worst thing is the sounds they make are the fucking horrible.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yes.  Terrible.  Yes.  Although people are worse.  Huh?  No.  People make a very weird guttural noise when burning.  It's a very weird, like a, oh, it's a fucking horrible, it's the sound you should make when  you're burning.  It's like a fucking, it's a horrible, no, it's not quite that high pitch. 
[01:22:30]  You start singing opera.  Oh, oh, it's like that type of thing, but more intense.  And I fucked up.  I never go into that world, but I clicked on something and then I just watched it.  Yeah, because it was on YouTube.  You're absolutely right, because it wasn't on one of those faces of death type websites.  So I'm like, oh, YouTube, how bad could this fucking be?  It is the worst fucking thing I've ever seen.  And it's still up there.  It doesn't have that many views, though, to be honest with you.  It does not have that many views.  Because it's really, I don't know, it's tough to fucking even click on. 
[01:23:00]  I did see a beheading recently called Gurgle.  Why?  Which was not good.  Why would you do that?  I would so not.  I will never watch another one of these videos ever.  There's too many things you cannot ever unwatch, so I steer clear of those.  That's one of them.  It honestly took a little piece of my soul.  Now I understand when people say it takes a little bit of your soul away.  Sam wants to watch it.  Huh?  I don't want to watch it.  No.  Travis ran out of here.  Yeah.  You can find it if you really need to watch it.  Trust me. 
[01:23:30]  Travis should have ran out of here a long time ago.  As soon as he clicked on his own dumb dog videos.  He should have fucking Herman Munstered through the door.  Stupid dog can't even catch a french fry.  French fries in his face.  What's your dog's name?  Fucking fry dropping asshole?  Chris, Travis walked in and hit me in the head with a pipe.  Bad-mouthing his dog.  Oh, jeez.  That's a wet one.  No, no.  Totally dry.  My farts were voted, actually, most likely to sound damper than they are. 
[01:24:00]  For what?  It was a really weird competition that they have in my neighborhood.  Here we go.  We got a cop.  Dave in Pennsylvania.  Dave.  Cop.  Listen to this shit.  Good morning, boys.  Hey.  Hi, Dave.  I was a retired police officer from New Jersey.  And it's actually in some pretty savage communities, dog fighting is a common practice. 
[01:24:30]  And lighting the dog on fire after they're done is a very common practice.  Yeah, I've heard about that, too.  That's kind of odd.  It's a horrific thing to witness.  And it happens almost all the time.  Can I ask you something?  Anyone can answer this.  What type of person could sit and watch that?  What happened to them?  Savages watch that.  No, I understand what you're hinting at. 
[01:25:00]  But what happened in their upbringing that you could actually sit through that?  And, you know, you know there's always a one or two out there that could sit through anything.  But if it's that common, that's what's bothersome.  You know what?  It's probably a lot of malt liquor and fried chicken really will do the trick.  I don't know.  I think that's one that cuts across all.  You would think.  I think that type of shit, like cruel people that can do that, cuts across every origin, every ethnicity. 
[01:25:30]  Because, like, there was a footage of that girl, wherever she was, throwing the live kittens in the fucking river.  You ever see that one?  And she was a fucking white chick in some country.  And people wanted her murdered.  And then there was the British woman who took the cat and put it in the garbage can and had been receiving death threats because it wound up on YouTube.  The surveillance camera picked it up.  And they rescued the dog.  But the fact is, this fucking cunt just put it in the garbage can and left it.  Or the cat, whatever it was, in the garbage can.  And people wanted to kill her. 
[01:26:00]  Sometimes I think that's the only way to handle people that do stuff like that is just to drag them into the street and back over them in the car.  I know that that sounds like you're just kind of perpetuating the lack of respect for life.  But if you've proven you can do that, like, if you can actually just murder an animal or something like that, you should just be dragged out in the street and your fucking head should be backed over.  Because you have nothing to contribute.  Every once in a while you get those stories where kids throw a bunch of kittens in a burlap bag and throw them in the water and stuff.  I don't know what kind of person could do that. 
[01:26:30]  Very nasty people.  All right, you don't like animals, that's fine.  I'm not an animal rights activist by any stretch, but I'm a fucking human being.  Like, I would love to know what kind of person it takes to do that.  When I see kittens, I pet them.  Kittens.  And I'm allergic to the fuckers.  I want them to fucking not be thrown in garbage disposals.  They're adorable.  All right, man.  Thanks, PA. 
[01:27:00]  Cop and PA.  We should break, finally, right?  Getting to some other shit.  51 million views of the surprise kitty.  You scratch his little belly.  Wow, that's cute.  Meanwhile, it's probably an act of being in agony.  Kittens on the internet.  Kittens are very cute when they're surprised.  Get Travis back.  Yeah.  Get Travis back.  We're back to cute videos.  What's this, the panda with the kitten?  It's a sneezing baby panda. 
[01:27:30]  Oh.  It has 101 million.  Oh, it scares the shit out of my mother?  Yeah.  Oh, God.  Now we have another asshole alert.  Anthony in New York.  Not you.  Yeah, this one, too.  I'm an asshole, too.  Anthony, what do you got?  Hey, good morning, guys.  Hi, Ant.  Hey, Jimmy.  That guy that called in, those dogs are called Russian or Chavez.  My wife owned two of them.  And the reason that they're so few of them in this country is because they cost $3,000 a piece. 
[01:28:00]  Oh.  Wow.  Because they're uncontrollable.  Let me tell you how uncontrollable these dogs are.  We had a dispute with a couple of people when we owned them.  The dogs are so aggressive that when I came home from work, they were hanging from a tree.  The neighbors hung them from a tree.  That's how aggressive they are.  They're trained to attack if their owners are aggressively attacked by someone.  They don't just roam around your yard and attack birds and small animals and children. 
[01:28:30]  Are they okay if you bring company over?  They're wonderful.  Just don't aggressively make a move towards the owner.  And they're very loyal to small children.  I mean, there was a point where I couldn't raise my hand and smack my children without that dog, you know, letting me know.  I couldn't even smack my own fucking kids.  How is this guy?  Yeah, it's awful.  You sneak in there, the dog starts barking.  You've got to pull up your pajamas and run out of the dog room. 
[01:29:00]  I heard a noise.  I was helping him.  He threw his rat.  Go ahead.  You just go right ahead.  I'm sorry.  Sorry.  That's okay.  It was just my pedophilia jokes.  You probably was a blessing in disguise.  Thank you, Anthony.  Thanks, man.  By the way, River Rat, he's a regular.  He says that they don't hold dogs and cats at the same value as Westerners. 
[01:29:30]  He did some time over there.  And another guy saying that, listen to this, fucking Pat in Houston.  Pat.  Pat in Houston.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  I just want to know that video of the dogs getting burned.  In Islamic countries, dogs and pigs are considered the lowest of all creatures.  Treat them or to burn them or to torture them for pleasure or anything would be considered  acceptable behavior.  Even the cute ones?  Yeah.  Muslims do not have dogs as pets. 
[01:30:00]  It's just...  So what are they?  These are all just wild dogs running around?  They're just wild dogs.  Must be sucked to be a dog in those countries.  Yeah.  You know, that's why Muslims don't eat pork and all that because pigs are considered...  Pigs and dogs are the lowest of creatures.  That doesn't dig on swine.  You guys want to watch Travis run down the hall again?  No.  Go back to that video.  What?  Are you going to show some hard work?  See, look. 
[01:30:30]  Travis is ready to run.  I'll leave.  I don't care.  No.  No.  Don't put it on at all.  Don't put one on.  No, I'm not stupid.  No, don't click on it.  I'm serious.  I can't watch this.  I can't watch this.  I was looking at Sam's cat over here.  I know.  That's a funny cat.  Yeah, now we're back to cute animals.  Are we done with the animal shit?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yes, we are.  I'm almost done with my sandwich.  Now people are checking in that, checked out the video on their own. 
[01:31:00]  It's fucking...  People are asking...  It's not a video because I haven't been there yet, but August 19th and 20th, I'll be in  Utah at Wise Guys Comedy Club.  Oh.  But no one was asking you.  Oh, I thought they were.  No.  I misunderstood the last call.  No one was asking.  Speaking of flaming...  Yes.  Yes.  Steve's picture's up on the screen.  Hello.  I wonder if they're going to keep Steve after they go to Sports Talk.  Oh, shit.  Are they going to Sports Talk?  Yeah, YSP's going to Sports Talk. 
[01:31:30]  Oh.  That's a definite.  Fucking...  Oh.  You know what, though?  That's a definite.  Is that...  What is it?  K-Rock couldn't make it?  They can't...  The rock can't make it there?  People just don't want it?  Is that what it is?  All these cities are losing their rock stations.  It's unbelievable.  And these rock stations have been there their entire lives.  Because you could get it anywhere else.  And they play the...  I was listening to the Q104.  It's amazing.  That survived.  And the fucking...  Whatever they play, Van...  What are they...  Oh, God.  Van Morrison?  Van Morrison.  Brown, I... 
[01:32:00]  It's the same...  Same shit.  Fucking shit.  Same 50 songs.  If that...  If that much.  So is Bonaduce staying in Sports Talk?  I don't know.  But, I mean, YSP's definitely going in Sports Talk.  Toucher and Rich are amazing.  Because they survived.  And they're still doing pretty much their show with a few differences.  But they survived that transition.  They're doing great up there in Boston.  So...  You know, I wouldn't want to talk sports all morning.  I wouldn't even want to talk about 10 minutes.  Yeah, but YSP's definitely going away.  Yeah, it looks like...  You know, they just got to stick with it. 
[01:32:30]  They got some...  Shut up!  I love Jim.  I would listen to Jimmy's Sports Talk, though.  Oh.  If you did that.  Well, it just looks like, you know, they got to come to the pool.  Oh, shut the fuck up!  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Frank from Bergenfield.  What's got on your mind?  You know what it looks like to me?  Like, does it really...  Is that what it looks like to you?  Oh, fuck yourself.  Shut the fuck up.  Just watch it.  Here's what happened.  He threw the fucking ball.  The guy missed it. 
[01:33:00]  Asshole.  It really is all nonsense.  Oh, it sucks.  It's just a bunch of hearsay.  It really is.  You know, we got to do in the offseason.  We got to stay healthy.  Really?  Because I thought cancer helped the team.  You fucking asshole.  Put the fuck up.  Stupid.  The same shit.  You know, we got to strengthen our pitching rotation.  It fell off a little bit in the last ten games.  And...  Bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah.  Well, you know what?  You're not wrong.  I know that. 
[01:33:30]  I just said we got to fucking strengthen our pitching rotation.  Of course I'm not wrong.  Who would say that's wrong?  No, good pitching is bad.  Mm-hmm.  Well, YSB is going to be one of those fucking...  I encourage everybody to abandon it.  Well, Philly's a big sports town, so...  Oh, they'll listen.  They'll do all right.  What do you think the Eagles?  I don't know.  Harold Carmichael's coming back.  Harold Carmichael?  Yeah, Ryan Jaworski's on the sideline coaching.  Ryan Jaworski.  Is he...  Hey, what's going on? 
[01:34:00]  What do you think about the Eagles?  I think the birds are going to fly.  You fuckhead.  We lose rock stations for that.  Oh, it's fucking hideous.  But rock stations did it to themselves.  Yes, they did.  They fucked it up.  Rock blocks on the same fucking faggoty songs.  They fucked it up.  They deserve what they get.  Now you just go to satellite or fucking...  All this competition was coming.  They saw it on the horizon.  They did nothing but sit there and let all the competition eat them up.  And they emasculated all male talk, so men don't want to listen to that shit. 
[01:34:30]  Nope.  It's all soft and corny.  I need a sandwich or a kiss.  That would be a great slogan for a sports station, though.  It's all hearsay.  It's all hearsay.  Yes.  5-10, the blech.  All right.  I listen to the fans sometimes.  It's like, what the...  Shut the fuck up.  What do you know?  Reporting from...  You know nothing.  The Yankee...  What do they call them?  The guys who will just follow the one team are Yankees?  Not correspondents. 
[01:35:00]  Uh...  Exactly.  I was going to say beat writers, but...  That's wrong.  I'm glad you didn't say that, because you would have humiliated yourself and the team.  I just did that.  I want to hear typical sports talk now.  I can't think of any right now.  It's terrible.  All that nonsense.  You know, it looks like the Mets are having a tough time, because, you know what?  They dropped three out of the last four, and the Braves are looking...  Yeah, I know, but the Braves have got a tough schedule.  They've got to go to the West. 
[01:35:30]  Do they got to go to the West Coast?  Shut up!  Fucking stinks!  Yeah, there's 120 games left in the season, but the Mets lost the last three out of five,  so that seems to be a problem, I guess.  Oh, we've got to find that third spot in the rotation.  Yeah, do we?  I hope we find...  I hope it's a black hole.  I hope they step on the mound, and they're sucked into a vortex, and never heard from again.  Now, that would be interesting.  Drop dead.  Another one is, uh, strengthen the bullpen. 
[01:36:00]  Oh, yeah, bullpen.  Oh, boy, the bullpen needs to be strengthened a little bit.  You know, we've got to get a lefty specialist in here.  Why?  Because the fucking guys in the majors, lefties can't hit a lefty?  You know what we've got to get in here?  Fucking music.  Get this fucking boring drollery off the fucking radio.  Oh, it's fucking horrible.  It's the same 30 callers in a fucking...  Every show has the same callers.  Do we have a good fucking piece of audio we can play? 
[01:36:30]  No, there is none from sports radio.  Damn it.  Any good audio from that?  No.  Any sports show.  I hate when they have the same name.  Hey, I'm Tim and Tim.  Hey, we're here talking sports.  Hockey, basketball, basketball, whatever.  Ugh.  Ugh.  Fucking drives me nuts.  And I used to listen obsessively.  Yeah?  Yeah.  You get to know them.  There's fucking Bob...  The fan is the big one here.  What's his name again?  Bob Page, his name is.  He talks a lot of boxing. 
[01:37:00]  I like him.  I used to listen to Steve Summers because he made it kind of fun.  No, he didn't.  You don't like Steve Summers?  Schmoozing on the other side of the glass.  Yeah, Steve Summers schmoozing on the overnight.  His claim to fame is that Jerry Seinfeld called him once in the middle of the night.  Ugh.  Oh, really?  That's that guy?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Steve Summers.  But when Imus used to be on, he used to say that.  He used to go schmoozing under the cover.  So, Imus in the morning.  Oh.  I'm schmoozing.  Right.  Ugh.  Oh, yeah.  Thank you, Noodles. 
[01:37:30]  Got to get a right-handed bat in the lineup.  Right-handed bat.  Schmoozing while a burning dog runs around my yard.  That would be good schmoozing to a beheading video.  Until gurgling is played.  I think they use deep in the rotation, right?  Of course they do.  They love saying deep in the rotation.  What a little weak as far as deep in the rotation goes.  We've got to fill that number eight spot in the lineup.  Really?  Why don't you fill it with an interesting call? 
[01:38:00]  How about that?  How about you fucking fill in from fucking six to ten on this fucking, on this station?  Because this sports talk is terrible.  Hey, we'll see what happens.  Of course we will.  Yeah, that's all we can do.  Of course we will.  That's all we can do is see what happens.  Everyone calling the station, everyone on the station, we'll see what happens.  Because they don't play.  Last night's game, what happened?  Eight to five.  We know one team scored more than the other team. 
[01:38:30]  Next story.  Fucking hate them.  Obviously.  Do you like this?  And the 1-0.  Swung on and hit it.  High in the air to deep left field.  That ball is high.  It is far.  It is gone.  Over the green monster into the monster seats.  Eduardo Nunez.  El Meteoro.  It's a home run over the left field wall.  And the Yankees tie the game at one. 
[01:39:00]  Wow.  Good call by the Bendeko.  That fucking asshole.  The Manicone.  The Manicone.  Squats on the bat and it disappears.  John, I couldn't believe he got two bats in his hidey.  I'm Susan Sheckler.  I always sound like I got sloppy with sliver.  I talk like a saint put on.  Posada knew he could take it all the way up to the hill. 
[01:39:30]  Posada looks like pine tar, but it's really stomach lighting on his back.  I can't believe that spirit just took it so far, John.  It is high and it's far and it's gone.  It's got blood on it.  John.  Mid is high.  Mid is far.  It is pink shocking.  Boom.  Jimmy, I got one for you that we forgot about as far as sports talk goes.  Obsessive trade talk where they just come up with trades that will never happen. 
[01:40:00]  That's the worst.  It's an adult warrior.  Hey, what about if we want two prospects for a quarterback and Ron Guidry?  I don't know.  What if you fucking put a fucking gun to your temple and ended this call properly?  For a quarterback and Ron Guidry?  Yeah, what do you think would happen if we try to trade two lefties for a righty?  I don't know.  I think it would be the same if you trade two righties for a lefty.  Go hang yourself.  How do you think of that? 
[01:40:30]  Obsessive trade talk.  Why don't you trade two apples for an orange?  Go fuck your mother.  No, we need a quarterback.  That's great because we as listeners need an interesting caller.  Now, the right-hander is set.  It'll be a 2-1.  Swung on and hit in the air to deep right center.  That ball is high.  It is far.  It is gone.  Good stop.  Into the Boston bullpen.  Stop.  Brett Gardner, instead of lining one down the right field line, hits a long shot to left 
[01:41:00]  center in the Boston bullpen.  Buff Gardner plants one.  And the Yankees take a 2-1.  That's it, you dumb Yankees.  It's just keep letting John Sterling make it about himself.  Gardner plants one.  Get it?  Yeah.  No, I didn't really get it.  That's only funny if Gardner is in a strip club and a stripper shows her asshole and he  kisses it aggressively until the bouchers remove him. 
[01:41:30]  Jimmy, I got another one for you.  His name is Graves.  Graves plants one.  Or rapist.  Teddy rapist plants one.  Deep in the seat.  You want another one?  Yes.  Please.  Oh, fuck.  They're coming in real quick.  Ah, Bill Tetley.  All right, here we go.  Hold on.  Nick C in Pittsburgh.  Don't forget about the utility player and the setup guy.  I hate the setup guy.  The 7th and 8th inning guy. 
[01:42:00]  The setup guy.  We don't have a strong setup guy.  It's always usually a lefty or righty specialist.  That's normally who the setup guy is.  Yeah, but you don't have to discuss it for an hour.  No, here's what you got to say.  We have anyone to go in the seat?  Yeah, we do.  All right, cool.  Yeah.  Next.  Do we got a guy that can throw seven pitches?  Yeah.  Good.  All right.  Another guy can come in and throw eight.  Yeah, thank you.  And a guy that can throw two to a lefty in a row.  It's fucking horrible.  I found a DVD or CD yesterday. 
[01:42:30]  Of?  He means crossdresser.  Of the O.P. and Anthony show.  What?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, what is it?  From when?  I'm bad.  1997.  So that was before we got fired in Boston.  It was called...  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  What's it called?  It had a bunch of tracks on it.  You know, break one, break two, break three, and shit like that.  And the theme of the show.  And this is for everyone that said how much we just ruled in the old days and suck now 
[01:43:00]  and everything.  That's why I laugh at those people.  They have no fucking idea.  You know you're a child of the 80s if...  That was the theme.  And people would call up and go, if you remember, you know, Pong, and...  Where is this tape?  And we're like, yeah, right, right, remember that?  You know we have to play the tape now.  It's so incredibly douchey, I couldn't finish listening to it. 
[01:43:30]  Why do you have a copy of that?  I don't know.  That means we probably thought it was a good fucking show.  And then another one that I haven't listened to that's labeled the same way, that's just  called Kunk.  Oh, yeah.  The Kunk Show.  Yeah, I remember the Kunk Show.  Yeah, yeah.  We decided to come up with a word that meant cunt.  Yeah.  Kunk?  The weird thing is...  Yeah.  Yeah.  The weird thing is listening to, coming out of songs that are fucking classic rock now,  pretty much.  These old 90s songs.  And you're going, that's the new one from, you know, Butt Trumpet. 
[01:44:00]  Well, they're 14 years old.  I know.  Those songs are 14 years old.  Crazy.  And I go opposite math.  So then 97, let's say, a song that was 14 years old would have been from 83.  Yeah.  How crazy is that?  Crazy.  You know?  I don't know.  Are you going to bring this in?  Yeah, yeah.  I'll bring it in.  Jimmy's gone tomorrow, so we got to do it Thursday.  I'm back Thursday morning.  Oh, you have to be here for this, because it's just fucking...  It's brutal. 
[01:44:30]  Yeah.  It's brutal.  I got to zip over the left coast today, and I got to do a little thing tomorrow, and I'm  going to fucking hang back on the red eye.  Come in.  I'm panicking and not sleeping again.  Here's another one, Jimmy.  Brad T in Kentucky.  Thank you.  They just come up with shit that means nothing.  We're really having trouble hitting with runners in scoring position.  What is that?  No, you're not.  I've just had bad luck.  You've had bad luck because your hitters stink.  Right. 
[01:45:00]  How do you actually officially have trouble hitting with runners in scoring position?  Statisticians should be beheaded because of what they come out with.  You know, technically, Billingsberger is 6 for 98 with runners in scoring position, less  than 3.  Really?  ESPN's even worse now.  ESPN fucking buzzed you with that strike.  I'm sorry.  You don't like the K-Zone?  The fucking K-Zone.  What's the K-Zone?  Only if there's three of them in a row, and there's a guy running with a fucking flaming  torch in his hand. 
[01:45:30]  I like the K-Zone.  I was watching at the Comedy Cell last night.  They had a Boston game on, and the fucking...  Do they have that up for every pitch?  No.  Oh, they don't?  Okay.  Take that fucking box off the screen.  Oh, I saw your tweet last night.  That was hilarious.  It drives me nuts.  What'd you say?  I could wait a 100th of a second more?  I can wait a 100th more of a second for the umpire.  I don't need the fucking...  To tell me if it was a strike or not?  Yeah, I know if it was a strike because the umpire goes,  I like the one that really yelled. 
[01:46:00]  Oh, we got Joey in Philly.  Yeah, this one drives me nuts.  First time caller, long time listener.  Oh, fucking hot.  That's only a good call if it's followed by a gunshot.  What about ESPN?  Oh, they'll put a...  As the count goes on, they'll put the batter's average in that count.  Like, he's batting .250 when it's a 2-0 count.  Or he's batting .327 when it's a 3-1 count. 
[01:46:30]  Is that necessary?  Yeah.  First of all, everyone probably has a higher fucking batting average  when it's 3-0 or 3-1  because the fucking pitcher is more likely to throw a strike  because he doesn't want to walk you.  Yeah, it's just more unnecessary stats.  Everyone has a lower average when it's 0-2  because you're going to get a junk ball thrown at you,  you fucking cunt announcer.  Really?  Hey, he's got a low average against knuckleballers when it's 0-2.  Really?  What an odd stat that a knuckleballer,  an 0-2, he doesn't hit fucking a lot of doubles. 
[01:47:00]  I hate knuckleballers.  How do you hold the ball like that?  Rotten fingernails with no sensation in them?  You don't like Tim Wakefield?  I hate Tim Wakefield.  How is he still in the league?  Because he throws a knuckleball.  Hey, look, it's 67 miles an hour  and it made a left on fucking Tewksbury Street.  Tim Wakefield should get fucking prostate polyps.  You said Tewksbury Street.  Yeah, it made a left on Tewksbury Street  or some shitty street in Boston.  It made a left.  Yeah, this is Punch-A-Spook Road. 
[01:47:30]  That's a great town up there, you guys.  He started the pitch at the Citgo side.  Yeah, dip below the Citgo  and right under the racial incident.  Came around the green monster.  Yeah, right around old Down Syndrome Tugmayor.  One, two, three strikes, you're out.  One, two, three strikes, you're out.  One, two, three strikes, you're out.  I hate Tim Wakefield.  His name would be Tim Water Behind a Boat Valley or something. 
[01:48:00]  Oh, wow.  That was brutal.  Oh, yeah, that was a good one.  Let's go to Dan in Tennessee.  Dan.  Dan.  Hello, Dan.  Good morning, gentlemen.  Good morning, Dan.  What just pisses me off.  Language.  Sport talk radio  is when they will get on there,  the callers, and they'll go,  yeah, we did this,  or we're going to do...  You don't play on the stupid team.  Right.  Oh, the we thing, yeah. 
[01:48:30]  That drives me nuts, too.  Why do people say we?  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, we're going to get them next week.  Oh, we get you.  All right, how many times are you going to say it?  We get you, yeah.  I'm just kidding, brother.  Thank you.  Can we do a sports call?  This is how a sports call should go.  Could somebody else call up...  This is the fucking...  The Who Cares fucking sports talk show.  They're so lit.  We got to clear them.  The Who Cares sports talk show.  Pete in Jersey.  Pete.  What's up, guys?  How you doing?  Hey, Pete.  Welcome aboard.  What do you got? 
[01:49:00]  What up, kid?  Listen, I'm actually a sports fan,  but I totally agree.  I mean, the talk in the BS is way online.  It goes way overboard.  They're looking for too much drama.  But I have to bring up one thing  that the Mets brought out last month.  Ah, what?  No, this is a real thing, Jerry.  You're going to die when you hear this one.  Go ahead.  I remember this.  Okay, he was in some sort of a slump,  and they can't figure it out.  One day, they actually come out,  and they say blue-eyed baseball players  cannot hit during the day. 
[01:49:30]  He can't hit in the day because he has blue eyes.  Well, you know what?  You know what?  I've been hearing a light refraction off the eyes.  You know what?  It's not.  You know what?  Hey, maybe they're not wrong.  You know what?  You're getting all excited.  Who am I to say?  I have brown eyes.  I don't hit.  What do I know?  That's not a bad point.  Maybe that's accurate.  Let's do some research.  Take some calls.  So for the next four and a half hours,  we'll be talking about blue-eyed people  and how the Jews aren't.  See, I said Hitler.  Fucking horrible.  All right.  Now the calls are coming in for Sports Talk Jimmy. 
[01:50:00]  Anthony in Boston.  Anthony.  Hey, Sports Talk Jimmy.  Great to be on the EG.  Hey, great to have you.  Thanks a lot.  Wait, what's your show called?  Hold on, Anthony.  What's your show called, Sports Talk Jimmy?  Hey, thanks a lot.  Welcome to...  It's got to have a sports term,  like the hub, the dugout, the...  Oh, the fucking...  How about...  The bench.  Yeah, the bench.  That's got to have a theme.  The mound.  How about... 
[01:50:30]  The end zone.  No, not the end zone.  That's been done too many times.  In the dugout.  Yeah, you're in a dugout.  In the dugout with Sports Talk Jimmy.  Hey, you're in a dugout.  Yeah, you're in a dugout.  Sports Talk Jimmy.  Yeah, you're in a dugout with Coach Jimmy.  What are you doing?  What's going on?  Hey, Jimmy, I got a football question.  Sure, sure.  I got a football answer.  I just do snappy patter.  I don't understand.  I'm going to run over you.  But I don't understand why Belichick, he's blitzed in the weak side corner in a third  and long situation. 
[01:51:00]  I don't understand it.  Well, Belichick for a long time, everyone's been telling him, Bill, go fuck your mother.  But he just won't do it, so he keeps doing that.  All right, thanks for the call.  Let me say hi to Eric in Brooklyn.  Eric.  Hey, what's up, guys?  How you doing?  All right.  First time in a long time.  Hey, welcome aboard.  You're in a dugout.  How about Susan Waldman or any female reporters who sit there and claim that, you know...  I'd rather fucking Ant Hill than Susan Waldman.  I would rather fucking Ant...  An angry Ant Hill than that woman. 
[01:51:30]  Go ahead.  She's the worst.  She's got a pair of balls in her mouth and she's always jiggling them.  Why, sir?  Why so mean?  She is horrendous.  Yeah, she's not great, but I do like her because she's just so pro-Yankee, but she does  kind of stink.  It's terrible when she chimes in.  Oh, awful.  She just doesn't offer much.  Oh, really?  All right.  This is great.  Mr. Coffee.  Hey, it's been a while, Mr. Coffee.  How are you, brother?  Good, good. 
[01:52:00]  How you doing?  Hey, I'll get to you in an instant.  Hey, speaking of Mr. Coffee, you know, my old hero, Joey D used to sell Mr. Coffee.  And then he punched Marilyn right in the clit.  Go ahead.  You're on the air.  Now, usually when a sports station is having, like, a bad day, they always go, you know,  go backwards.  We talk about, like, Pete Rose and the people in the Hall of Fame and who's the home-run  king?  Was it Barry Bonds or Babe Ruth and all this stuff?  They go backwards. 
[01:52:30]  Holy shit.  You're on to something.  There's top...  What are the top five go-to things they do when, yeah, it's a slow sports day?  We had two of them, I think.  Pete Rose.  They definitely do the Pete Rose.  Asterisk.  They argue who is the greatest home-run hitter of all time.  Yeah.  You know any of them, Travis?  How about some classic pitchers against modern hitters?  Yeah, you could do that.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  You could go local and do best Yankee team ever.  Oh, right, right.  Very good.  Pick the greatest Yankee team ever. 
[01:53:00]  Or make your own.  Right.  Make your own team, yeah.  No rules.  What do you have on there?  Oh, shortstop's a tough one, though.  Who do you put on as the greatest Yankee shortstop of all time?  Oh, you gotta go.  Come on.  You gotta go with Derek Jeter.  Or the big argument was, was Campanella more effective before or after he was in a wheelchair?  That's what I want to do.  I want to host a sports show and then have questions like that.  Hey, look, there's an argument to be made that he was more effective after he was in the chair. 
[01:53:30]  So call up with your opinions.  Him and his stupid dead legs.  Oh, shit.  Fuck him.  Yeah, that's great.  Was Roberto Clemente, you know, more and more valuable after his plane went into the fucking  forest?  Oh, they like to predict, too.  When guys go before their time, what kind of player they would have been.  Or when guys get injured and couldn't reach their potential.  Like a Mark Fidrich or something?  Yeah, now Mark Fidrich, was he a better pitcher or a garbage truck driver? 
[01:54:00]  Go.  You're on the air.  Thank you, because he was killed doing that.  Yeah.  That's how horrible his life went.  Yeah, the bird.  How ironic.  He was fucking...  Could have been the Grays and he got crushed by one of his trucks, right?  Crushed by a dump truck.  Jesus Christ.  What a dick.  That sucks.  Fidrich.  That's a great Ted Sheckler name.  Oh, what was the fucking name?  Oh, they wanted to call your show the Knuckleball Show.  Oh.  Oh, you said Tewksbury.  What's that?  I answered too many things at one time. 
[01:54:30]  Tewksbury.  Yes.  That was the street.  Yes.  You came up with it.  Made a left on Tewksbury.  You asked for that.  Did I?  No.  Another street?  Sam, because where we stayed in a hotel in San Diego, the fucking name of the street,  it just sounded like...  Who is it?  The Sheckler's best friend?  Yeah, it was the Neighbors.  The Neighbors.  The last name of the Neighbors was the street we were staying.  I don't know why.  It just hit me.  I couldn't think of it.  I know we got a break, but now everyone's in with Sports Talk Jimmy. 
[01:55:00]  Kevin in Georgia.  Good morning, old man.  Sports Talk Jimmy.  My favorite is, thanks for taking my call.  Yeah, they have to take calls.  It's easy.  You just plunk a button down.  Exactly.  It's extremely random.  Don't feel so privileged.  That's a groveling that they don't need to know what else to say.  Yeah.  I like when callers call in and they say that they want to dispute a point made by Dan  from 25 minutes ago.  Oh, right, right.  One of the other callers. 
[01:55:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, I don't agree with that at all.  They've got a great team this year.  What about...  It's so huge now, fantasy football talk, where you're not even a fan of a team anymore?  You're a fan of your fantasy football team?  Fantasy fucking sports.  It does nothing that makes you want to put on a metal shoe and kick somebody's balls.  I love fantasy football.  It fucking stinks.  It's fun.  Hey, I got one guy from the Padres, the one guy from the Mets, the one guy from the Giants. 
[01:56:00]  Do you?  Fucking cunt.  Hey, what was he batting?  Hey, you know what?  I didn't invest you in on the whole game because you watch every game.  Really?  That's what you need to do?  Watch every game?  Why don't you stop?  Invest less.  It hasn't taken off in baseball as much as football, Jimmy.  And I would say a huge part of our audience have fantasy football teams.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah?  Good.  A huge part of our audience should be killed in a gas fire.  Fucking blithering idiots.  You know what my fantasy football is?  That fucking I get their contracts, you get to fuck their wives while they all go down 
[01:56:30]  in a plane.  That's my fantasy football.  Oh, and they discuss it now.  Oh, wait.  We got one coming in for Sports Talk.  Jimmy, Bill in Philly.  Bill?  Oh, Bill.  Hi, Coach Jimmy.  Hi, Bill.  First, I want to say follow Poncho Pirate on Twitter.  And second, my seventh string wide receiver has gone down in my 25-team league.  Who should I pick up?  I'll listen off the air for your answer.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:57:00]  That's one thing for that one.  Oh, yeah.  I'm going to hang up and listen to your answer.  I'm going to hang up and listen to your answer.  Thanks.  No way.  That would be great if they hang up and the guy just doesn't even acknowledge that the  gentleman called.  Yeah.  Just goes on to another subject as the guy sits there waiting for his call.  That's cool.  Why don't you listen and then paint your face and watch a Bjork video?  You want Mike Francesca shit or more catchphrases?  Francesca, because I hate Francesca.  Let's go to Ryan in the Bronx.  There you dog.  I'll tell you, since Mad Dog left that show, I have not listened to him once. 
[01:57:30]  He's doing well, though.  She shows you how unimportant his personality is.  Mike and the Mad Dog, I listened for the Mad Dog.  And then when Mad Dog came over here, I was done with Mike.  What do you got there, Ryan in the Bronx?  Two points about that.  Number one, he claims to be the most knowledgeable guy about sports.  And sports are super manly.  I'm a fan.  But he's really close to a Star Trek fan.  I mean, he's almost a nerd.  You know, he's like a sports nerd.  And he thinks, like, if you don't agree with him, you're the worst, you know?  He's a dick.  Yeah.  He's a dick.  And fucking, he does a four-hour show, but he does two hours worth of material because 
[01:58:00]  he repeats himself constantly.  He's like, a guy I called about Mark Sanchez and compare him to Tom Brady.  He'll be like, oh, you're talking about Mark Sanchez, okay?  He's a young kid.  You're talking about Tom Brady.  He's the best quarterback in the world, okay?  Best quarterback in the world, okay?  He's the best quarterback in the world, okay?  He's the best quarterback in the world.  And then the guy I call up after, like, Mike, you're absolutely right.  Tom Brady is the best quarterback in the world.  Of course.  He's the best quarterback in the world. 
[01:58:30]  Wow, you got it down, brother.  That is exactly what that fucking fat asshole does.  And the other thing Mike Francesca does, he has the most boring TV show ever.  It's horrible.  Because they obviously threw TV cameras on him.  He doesn't look up once, has no energy whatsoever, and he drinks his stupid diet soda the entire  time.  He has to rip the label off, okay?  And, you know, I can't show the label to the cameras, okay?  You're going to have a sponsorship on my show, okay?  Okay.  That's really good.  That's really good, brother.  All right, bud.  Thank you.  Good job. 
[01:59:00]  Thank you.  Bye-bye.  Let me say hi to Matt in Jersey.  Matt?  Hey, guys.  If you go up on YouTube, there's people that post videos that prank call his show and call  him a big fatso.  It's really hysterical.  I just said he can...  A big fatso.  He thinks he can get to the dump button before it gets on the air.  He's like, you see, folks?  You think you're going to get through?  You think you're being funny?  It's not going to get through.  And it gets through anyway.  It's so funny.  Can we find that?  Can we see some of those?  There's one time some guy, he does the... 
[01:59:30]  I'm going to do a quick comment or a question.  I'm going to hang up and let you talk about it.  But I asked him his comment, and he says, one more question.  Do you think Jose Reyes has the biggest cock in the mess last week?  Really?  Are they on YouTube?  All right, hold on.  We're going to get one here.  TJ in New Hyde Park.  What's up, TJ?  Hi, Mike.  First time in a long time.  Good.  What's going on?  I just have a question.  Who has lower expectations on a nightly basis?  The Islanders or your wife? 
[02:00:00]  All right.  That's a guy who's waited a long time for a stupid remark.  But again, here's the thing, TJ.  I hope TJ's listening.  These dumb jokes don't get on the air.  You wait and you wait.  It's on a delay.  It doesn't get on the air.  It's on the air.  Jersey, what's up, Jim?  Hey, Mike.  How are you?  Ridiculous, man.  Well, you know, people wait all that time, but they forget that the joke's not going to  get on the air.  You've got to knock your radio down, please, Jim.  Yeah, I'm sorry. 
[02:00:30]  It's the TV.  Okay.  It was on the air.  It's hilarious.  It went over the air.  Of course.  But what a bore he is to do.  That's a guy's sports talk.  Lower expectations.  It met to your wife.  Yeah, yeah.  Why not do something funny?  Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Wrinkle neck.  Hey, yeah, yeah.  Is there more prank calls?  Yeah.  Oh, let's go with it.  Thank you, Matt.  No problem.  What, are you just laying on the floor in front of the door or something, Matt?  Joe in Bergen.  What's up, Joe?  Hey, Mike.  How you doing?  Good, thanks. 
[02:01:00]  Hey, Mike.  How you doing?  Good, thanks.  I had two quick points.  First of all, I can say you did a phenomenal job covering the NCAA tournament last week.  Now, I'm going to cover it all, let alone as well as you did.  That's the butter of it.  Well, thank you, Matt.  I mean, what do you think the chances are that O.J. Reyes had the biggest cop in that  locker room?  Well, you see, here's the thing I try to tell you guys.  When you call up and you try to do something stupid, like curse or something like that, or 
[02:01:30]  try to get something like that through, you can't get it through.  You can't do it.  So, we're on a delay for that reason.  So, that ruckleheads don't do stuff like that.  And if you do, you'll get away with it anyway.  So, it's not a big deal.  So, you don't worry about it.  It doesn't work, though.  You can't do it.  It's impossible.  That is so fucking funny.  Are we visiting the studio next week?  No, here you go.  Neil in Queens, what's up, Neil?  Hey, it's Neil from Queens.  Yes, Neil.  I'm kind of waiting.  What are you waiting for?  Wasn't that you are going to have me speak as a regular caller? 
[02:02:00]  Yeah, you are.  So, I'm just waiting?  No, you're on the air.  What would you like to say?  Oh, I wanted to say that I think we're just going to win.  So, I think Neymar's going to have a great game.  And Bruiser and Snell, you know, they were number one draft picks.  And it's time for the Jets to win again.  All right.  Did you wait a long time to say that?  What did he say?  He's talking about the 69 Jets.  He's mentioning 69 Jets.  Why doesn't Mike have a fucking sense of humor?  Because he's hilarious. 
[02:02:30]  What's wrong with that?  You do this every day.  Have a sense of humor about it.  He's a bore.  Emerson Boozer.  He's a bore, Mike Francesca.  You stink, Mike.  He blows.  You really do.  You're going to see it at all.  I don't think you're going to see Jorge Vina play.  Steve in Boundbrook.  What's up, Steve?  Mike, how's it going, man?  What's up?  Hey, regarding the Jeter injury, you've got to get an MRI.  He already had one.  Yeah, but Mike, listen.  What you've got to do, get the MRI.  Whether he goes on a DL or not, you've got to give him some of your Diet Coke.  That's the elixir.  You know what I'm saying, Mike? 
[02:03:00]  Oh, God.  Don't listen to me, the number, please.  Anthony in River Edge.  What's up, Anthony?  Hey, Mike.  How's it going for a long time?  What's up?  No sense of humor whatsoever.  No, it doesn't even come close to cracking a smile.  He's a fucking self-righteous, know-it-all fatso.  None humor.  He's unlistenable.  Sure, I had a lineup for the Yankees and asked the Yankees to play the series.  It's not the same thing.  It really does make it very, very tough.  It really does.  All right, Andy on the cell phone. 
[02:03:30]  What's up, Andy?  It's a little fast, right?  Hi, Mike.  This whole David Wright situation is completely ridiculous, but I have a perfect solution.  Well, how is it ridiculous?  What's ridiculous about it?  Well, listen, they could get Keith Hernandez to play third base for two weeks, and it'll  bring fans to the stadium, and it'll give the Mets fans something to cheer for us.  No, wait a second.  Wait a second.  Wait a second.  Wait a second.  Your solution is for Keith Hernandez to play third base for two weeks?  Keith Hernandez?  Yes.  No, all right.  Keith in there for two weeks.  You're wasting our time.  You are seriously wasting everybody's time by even making that phone call. 
[02:04:00]  2-1-2, 2-2-9, 3-4-80.  That just shows you that the regular number's not working, because if it was, you wouldn't  have that call.  2-1-2, 2-2-9, 3-4-80.  And what's wrong with having a calling letter once in a while?  A guy whose solution is that.  I would fucking listen if I knew this shit was going through.  That's hilarious.  Mike Francesca is a dullard.  He really is a dullard.  Someone's saying, look up Mike Francesca chowing down on...  Oh, it just says chowing down.  Let's see if that one works.  Thanks.  Puddle of AIDS.  Oh, he's good for...  Yeah, he's reliable. 
[02:04:30]  I like to see him eating cum and a bullet.  Not in that order.  I guess this is during one of the breaks.  They zoom in on him.  What's he eating?  Chili.  That's good.  It's chili.  He's just eating fucking chili.  Whatever.  Any more prank calls?  I think most of the other ones are him yelling at callers. 
[02:05:00]  Yeah.  Well, that's good.  That's fucking hilarious.  It's so easy to get under his skin.  He's a crank.  So you were waiting that long to say that?  It has to be seen.  But again, I think Beltran will be traded.  I think K-Rod will be traded.  And I do think, unfortunately, Reyes will wind up being moved at the end of the season.  Bronson in California joins us.  What's going on, Bronson?  Hey, Mike.  How are you?  Good.  I wanted to ask you about the Yankees infield.  And I'm also wondering if you think it's unfair what happened to Funtime on the board. 
[02:05:30]  It's getting banned.  What was the second thing?  Matthew Funtime.  He posted in the breakfast thread and made all those photoshops.  He's always talking about religion and he got banned.  It's kind of controversial.  He got banned where?  From the board.  From where?  You know, from the board.  He usually hasn't posted in the game.  What is the board?  You know, it's the board.  The board is the board.  I don't know what the board means.  What an idiot.  Okay, well, I was also asking about, you know, do you think Jeter could be moved to first base and then you move to Sherr the third? 
[02:06:00]  I mean, you just, you called from California to prove that you just don't have a brain in your head?  I mean, I mean, I mean, it's amazing.  You know, I should have let him, I should have got rid of him when he was talking gibberish before.  I mean, you know, hey, listen, people, that guy waited on the phone for like an hour to call up and ask if we're going to move Jeter to first base.  I mean, you've got to have something better to do with your life. 
[02:06:30]  I mean, you really, you really have, you really do.  No.  That's funny.  You don't.  Anyone who calls his show, by the way, he could say that to.  Yeah.  You should have something better to do with your life.  Right.  Is that it?  Yeah.  Oh, by the way, the fucking name of the street, which I just knew had to be the Sheckler's Neighbors, was Felsper.  F-E-L-S-P-A-R.  The Felspers live over there.  The Felspers were my neighbors.  Felsper.  Mrs. Felsper would babysit me while my mother was incarcerated. 
[02:07:00]  Was she in the joint fortune?  She stole from Bad Burgers.  Mrs. Felsper were like parents to me.  Mr. Felsper had to knock on doors and do something with Megan.  Tell everybody he was in the neighborhood.  Hey, by the way, the Dow futures up 162 now. 
[02:07:30]  Is that good?  Like, what's the difference?  What's the fucking difference?  This morning, the Dow futures were down 110.  Now the Dow futures are up 160, and nothing has changed.  I'll tell you, when did, let me ask you, when did Warren Buffett smack that fucking company?  I don't know.  Oh, that was a while ago.  That was last week.  It was like...  Oh, okay.  I think you might have made a couple bucks on Apple already.  Mm-hmm.  What's it up?  Pre-market. 
[02:08:00]  It's up $4.21 in pre-market.  To what?  To three...  Here it comes.  $357.  I think I bought it like $360 or $361.  I'm still down.  Why'd you buy...  How'd you buy high?  Because I'm a dope.  But you don't buy high.  But yesterday, it was cheaper.  Yeah.  What'd you do?  Did you buy it yesterday?  It might have dropped farther.  Yeah, it might have dropped farther.  Farther where?  Oh, it dropped further down from where you bought it.  I think so, yeah.  And then it went back a little bit today. 
[02:08:30]  Oh, believe me.  It'll come back up.  That fucking stock is gold.  I don't have enough to make real money on Apple anyway.  No?  Yeah, dude.  Come on.  What do you got?  $600,000 into it?  I sunk about $2 million into it.  But I said...  I bought it $361.  I said, I'm going to sell if it gets to $358 again.  That's good.  Yes.  S&P futures.  The future.  I got a tinkle.  Are we going for a record today? 
[02:09:00]  Yeah, I know.  Oh.  All right.  There is one more.  One of these days we should go commercial free all the way to the 10.  John in New York.  John.  Phenomenic.  Just to wrap up the mic, Francesca.  I remember this one.  Go ahead, John.  You have to play the clip.  It was after Big Mad Dog came over to Sirius and he went on Sturm and he played and he responded  and said, you have to come after me with more than a pea shooter.  It makes me laugh every time I hear it. 
[02:09:30]  It's on YouTube.  It's hilarious.  It makes you laugh.  Yeah.  Hopefully we can find it.  What do you mean with a pea shooter?  He's basically saying, if you're going to come at me, you better come at me with some  shit.  You have to go after him with more than a pea shooter.  Right.  You see it there anywhere?  There's...  We might have it.  Hold on.  I don't think we're getting canceled.  The ratings are excellent.  My Sunday morning show is first 20 out of 22 weeks.  My Sunday morning show is first. 
[02:10:00]  Right now, this show for the winter is first.  Those are facts.  If someone wants to tell stories, I don't really care.  But you know the problem is, I have to answer these things.  And then people will say that I'm breaking.  I can't worry about that.  I'm just telling you what the fact is.  And I didn't start this.  I didn't bring it up.  I didn't say that his show was going to get canceled.  I didn't make any jokes about Sirius.  I've never said anything except nice things about Sirius.  They made a big deal.  They disparaged my producers in Tampa. 
[02:10:30]  Made them both feel really bad.  And we were in a competition.  I mean, I just went down and do my show.  I wasn't worried about where I did it from or who got one guest or stuff like that.  The fact that I threw any fits in Tampa, I totalized.  No one could ever say they saw that because it didn't happen.  I didn't even know those certain guests were on the show until I got home on Saturday.  And I never had any reaction.  This is terrible.  Him talking about fucking...  Who cares?  Well, we took a shot.  Yeah.  We didn't pre-listen to it. 
[02:11:00]  Hmm...  I don't know.  His fucking fat head bugs me.  Of course we do.  I'd love to just insult him.  You know, you guys shut up.  You gotta bring more than a pea shooter.  How about a treadmill, piggy?  Oink, oink.  Just like a child insult him.  After two hours of solid radio, we stumble to the break.  Stumble.  We really do clumsily and fucking with palsy in our veins.  No.  help me. 
[02:11:30]  Hey, girl.  Stop what you're doing.  Hey, girl.  You drive me to a joint.  I don't know how I forgot to...  It's a person when I like you.  I...  You don't go nothing.  Nothing means you love me, son  You know in case you break down 
[02:12:00]  I'll be the pain  And I'll never find out  I'll be the pain  Hey, pain  I got something I think you wanna know  Hey, pain  I'm gonna take a bite  I'm gonna hold you so  I'm gonna hold you in my arms  Oh, I'll never let you go 
[02:12:30]  Cause I am a still child  I feel like I should break down  I'll be the pain  And I'll be the pain  And I'll be the pain  And I'll be the pain  And I'll be the pain  And I'll be the pain  And I'll be the pain 
[02:13:00]  I'll be the pain  And I'll be the pain  Cause I'm gonna take that breakdown  And I'll be the pain  And I'll do my mind  And I'll be the pain  And I'll be the pain  And I'll be the pain  And I'll be the pain  And I'll be the pain  And I'll be the pain  And I'll be the pain  And I'll be the pain  And I'll be the pain  And I'll be the pain  And I'll be the pain  And I'll be the pain  And I'll be the pain  And I'll be the pain 
[02:13:30]  And I'll be the pain  And I'll be the pain  And I'll be the pain  And I'll be the pain  And I'll be the pain  And I'll be the pain  And I'll be the pain  And I'll be the pain  And I'll be the pain  And I'll be the pain  And I'll be the pain  And I'll be the pain  And I'll be the pain  And I'll be the pain  And I'll be the pain  We don't need a sweeper! 
[02:14:00]  You idiots!  Why'd you say I'm not going to do a sweeper and then you did a sweeper?  Because I yanked it over and it still played.  Why would we need a sweeper coming out of that?  Explain to me, because you've been doing radio much longer than me, E-Rock.  That's radio.  Yeah, E-Rock knows.  But you come out of a song like that.  Come out of an up-tempo number into a goddamn sweeper.  Yeah, that was Les Zeppelin from yesterday.  Yes, it was. 
[02:14:30]  Communication breakdown.  Yeah.  I will go on record and say that I really enjoyed myself and I enjoyed the band and I enjoyed  their interpretation of the Zeppelin songs.  And then I walked home yesterday and I was checking my Twitter.  And Jimmy was too.  Oh, man.  And you fuckers just fucking...  Real critics out there.  Destroyed Les Zeppelin.  I enjoyed them.  And I'm like, what was I listening to?  I know you were right.  I enjoyed them too.  I really liked them. 
[02:15:00]  I think if we took an accurate poll, I think more people liked them than did not.  But there's some funny fuckers out there, man, because they fucking killed them.  I'm trying to remember some of them.  I was just laughing because we were doing the sports talk thing.  Yeah.  I wish I would have read Twitter before.  One guy asked a sports question.  Yeah.  Was Corey Lytle's curveball more or less effective after he flew into that building?  His plane did the ultimate curveball, though.  Oh, that really did.  So, thumbs up or down on Les Zeppelin?  I gave him thumbs up.  Yeah. 
[02:15:30]  What was the one tweet you read yesterday that cracked me up?  I should go through it a whole lot.  Let me just go back.  Yeah.  How do we do that?  Just scroll backwards.  No, man.  I get at least 1,000 replies a day.  I can't do that.  Oh, I don't get that many.  I don't know how to do that.  You get two a day?  You get two replies?  What if I write...  A million, I said.  If I write Les Zeppelin in my search or something, how do we do this?  Maybe.  Let's see.  Let's see. 
[02:16:00]  You could go back that far.  There were some bad ones I read.  Yeah.  But I disagree.  I actually thought they were good.  Yeah, I thought it was cool.  Yeah, I thought it was cool.  I tweeted that I enjoyed them.  Yeah, whatever.  Hold on a second.  I got a few of them.  There were some Ozzy references.  Well, the drummer was a big girl.  The drummer was a big, tough broad.  She would kick your ass.  Is there anyone on staff that could take the drummer, you think?  No, no. 
[02:16:30]  It would just be vicious.  I would like to think I could take the drummer from Les Zeppelin, but I think I would lose badly.  It would have been a vicious beating.  I think Kenny would have a challenge with her.  Yeah.  Kenny would try to fuck her.  It's pretty.  Okay, here's the first one.  Yeah.  From Pizzle Snizzles.  Holy shit, Les Zeppelin fucking stinks.  A lot of S's.  A bunch of them.  I didn't think they sucked at all.  I didn't either. 
[02:17:00]  Oh, and he just Pizzle Snizzles again.  Ew.  Are you fucking kidding me?  They're terrible.  He must be in a Zeppelin cover band.  Because I think he tweeted a lot yesterday about it.  I had to ban him because he tweeted too much about the same subject.  You got banned?  Yeah, one of my rules.  I got a lot of rules.  Wait, wait.  There was one.  Communication breakdown.  I thought that the lady was cute.  Oh, yeah.  Les Zeppelin is hot if you're into lead singers with a Rocky Dennis face. 
[02:17:30]  You are in New York City and you think that mess is hot.  Wake up, chinless.  That was flip-flop 43211.  And that was the one I read while they were singing and I had to put my phone down because  I was laughing.  So laughing.  Because it was just so mean.  And I thought that was probably just a bad photo because she was cute.  She was sexy.  But it was just funny.  He was just such a cock to everybody. 
[02:18:00]  She's ugly.  Wake up, chinless.  Our fans are dead.  Oh, yeah.  And then Trucker Dale 69.  Wow, they suck.  Excuse me.  I didn't think.  I didn't either.  I enjoyed them.  I liked them.  Oh, yeah.  And flip-flop 43211 again.  Yeah.  The guitar playing is horrid with a bunch of R's.  He's got a vested interest in a Zeppelin band out there.  Yeah.  You got to think.  He was obsessed about hating them.  Some people are just obsessed.  Oh, yeah.  Pizzle snizzles again. 
[02:18:30]  These broads are fucking terrible with a bunch of exclamation points.  I saw one that just said, haggard old dyke.  Wow.  That's brutal.  I was trying to figure it out.  And someone nailed it perfectly.  And I think the drummer.  Bull dyke lesbian.  Yeah.  I think the keyboard player slash bassist.  Yeah.  Lesbian.  Lesbo.  Softer lesbo. 
[02:19:00]  Mm-hmm.  Lead singer.  Bye.  Yeah.  Dick and pussy for her.  And the guitarist straight.  Wow.  That's my take on Les Zeppelin.  Megan, what do you think?  She's a softer lesbian.  She was lesbo.  No doubt about it.  Softer lesbo.  She was all the way lesbo.  Yeah.  She likes to have a candle lit dinner before she licks box.  Munches.  But the bull dyke drummer.  Fuck that, man. 
[02:19:30]  Back gals.  You don't give a fuck.  Yeah.  She'll fucking do it wherever that pussy is, man.  She'll lick a pussy while a girl's having knee surgery.  Yeah.  She was a big girl.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Troy losing it, huh?  Troy, we're going to have to get Troy off the phone soon, Ant.  What happened?  We knew this day was coming.  Phone screeners only last about six months on this show.  Yeah, it's rough.  They can't take it.  How long has Troy been on the phones?  A year?  Two years or something, right?  It's probably been closer to a year. 
[02:20:00]  Wow.  Yeah, he's done.  Who are we going to put in his place?  Chip, I guess.  I'll answer phones.  Hey, don't I just crack everybody up on the phone.  Are you good at it?  Yeah, I'm great at it.  It would work.  You'd crack people up.  Hey, don, what's up?  I guess Roland taped Troy.  Yeah, well, while you guys were talking about sports, I had Troy, Eric likes to turn the  microphone up for my amusement while Troy screams, just in my headphones.  So while you guys were talking about Mike Francesa, I was listening to you in one ear  and Troy screaming in the other ear. 
[02:20:30]  What was the major maladjustment today?  Well, today somebody called up complaining, but said they wanted Troy, they said, I want  you to tell the guys not to do this.  And Troy said, are you telling me to tell them or do you want to tell them?  And so Troy didn't like that the guy didn't want to stay on hold.  Uh-huh.  So he started cussing at him.  Oh, okay.  And Roland, like the angel from heaven that he is, videotaped it.  So now there's audio.  Oh, great.  All right.  Where is it?  I want to hear it.  It's in Roland's possession. 
[02:21:00]  Is Roland there?  He tried to hand me his phone through the window just now.  He started walking toward the window.  He started walking toward the window.  With his phone.  To just hand you the phone through a sealed window.  Soundproof.  Here comes Roland.  What is wrong with these dumb?  Roland, were you trying to hand him the phone?  Roland.  Are you on the Wi-Fi?  I don't know.  Roland, I'm not giving up on this.  Why not fi?  Bridesmaids, why?  It's like just a taste if you like certain things that other people don't like. 
[02:21:30]  Taste of jizz, you homer.  That's a...  That's a...  It's a homer.  I enjoyed it, though.  That's a movie for feminine people.  Oh.  Yes.  Not for the fegitos.  What?  Yeah.  It's a good movie.  I loved it.  Shit.  You saw a movie last night, didn't you? 
[02:22:00]  Yes, that's right.  I saw Rise of the Planet of the Apes.  Oh.  Finally went to a movie theater.  Congratulations.  Yes.  I was in a movie theater.  How was it?  Was it how it was copy?  It was good.  Yeah, I liked it.  I want to see it.  I liked it.  It did get...  It did slow down a little in the middle.  But held my interest.  Cool.  Once you get past that CGI monkey shit, you know, you get over that pretty quick.  At first, you're kind of like, man, I didn't see it.  And then you realize, what were they going to do? 
[02:22:30]  Train fucking monkeys to do this shit.  So the CGI's a little rough?  No, it looks really good, but it's never going to look like a real fucking monkey.  Or not never, but not now.  Looks better than it did in the 60s.  Oh, yeah.  It looks really good, like, when Caesar's, like, standing up.  Because he walks, like, fucking upright, you know?  And he's got his little leather Planet of the Apes clothes on.  Right.  And he looks pretty badass.  Are they getting lazy in Hollywood?  What do you mean?  Because the old Planet of the Apes, they had to do the costumes, and they really were meticulous with how it looked. 
[02:23:00]  Yeah, there are things you couldn't do.  The facial expressions and stuff.  Wouldn't that be better, though, than CGI?  Couldn't do it.  The way they move and shit and jump around, you can't get fucking, you know.  What the hell, is Roddy McDowell going to be swinging from fucking trees in a forest?  I saw the making of Planet of the Apes.  It was amazing what they had to go through to get that makeup.  The original, really?  Yeah.  It took hours and hours to get that makeup on Rodney.  It was pretty cool, though. 
[02:23:30]  They had a couple of moments that were homage to the original.  A couple of the similar lines and shit like that.  Which is like, ah, I remember when he said that.  Right.  That was Charlton Heston's line.  Right.  Yeah, I thought it was good.  Get your...  The movie theater, though, was...  Did they do Get Your...  It's doing well, right?  The movie?  Did they do Get Your Hands Off Me?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Damn Dirty Ape.  Damn Dirty Ape?  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  That's a real fucking pretty cool part right there.  Okay.  Yeah. 
[02:24:00]  But the theater...  Yeah, I went to the theater.  It was, like, empty.  What?  It was, like, amazing.  I don't know.  That's weird, because the movie's doing really well.  I know.  Here it's doing really well, but I don't know.  Yeah, and I heard that some of the theaters were empty, too.  No, you didn't, Chip.  Mm-hmm.  You didn't, Chip.  Stop your lying.  Stop your incessant lying.  I seen Planet of the Apes.  It was good.  No, you didn't.  I did.  It was all right.  It was all right.  You know, I was at the part where the apes were running around and jumping on stuff. 
[02:24:30]  Yeah.  Jumping on stuff.  There's a little twisty thing in there, too.  Should I tell everybody what it is?  No.  He doesn't know what it is.  He doesn't know what it is.  Explains a few things, because people had some questions, like, you know, hey, well,  if this happened, what about this or that?  And it's like, yeah, it's pretty well explained as to how that could be the beginning of what  ends up, you know, thousands of years from now as being a Planet of the Apes. 
[02:25:00]  You know.  Because it probably, I know what happens.  I don't want to say.  I am.  They got a franchise on their hands?  Uh-huh.  Really?  Oh, I see fucking sequels.  I see fucking sequels.  Was it as good as the Marky Mark version?  Yeah, much better than the Marky Mark version.  Was it as good as the original?  Well, the original was so, like, fucking...  Creepy.  ...cool and odd.  You got it.  And it's hard to look at the original now without realizing how dated some of the shit 
[02:25:30]  is, and, you know.  But you didn't know where they were in the first one.  This one, you know where they are.  Right, that's fucking...  That was the freak out of the first one.  It was like, if you didn't know, you know.  Right.  That that thing happened.  If you didn't know that that was fucking Earth, that they were on the entire fucking  movie, at the end, you're just like, holy shit.  Yeah, I've seen that in the movies.  None of us know when it came out.  You do not.  Are they going to go with the brain people? 
[02:26:00]  That always creeped me out.  I hated that fucking Beneath the Planet of the Apes with the mutants.  It was all just some 70s fucking dumb, groovy, acid-trippy shit.  I didn't like that one.  And then the rest just got really bad.  But there was a few.  There was Beneath the Planet of the Apes.  Escape from the Planet of the Apes.  Conquest of the Planet of the Apes.  Hats for the Planet of the Apes.  Hats for the Planet of the Apes.  I think I missed that one.  Bowling with Planet of the Apes. 
[02:26:30]  And then there was a dodgeball with Planet of the Apes.  Tap dancing with Planet of the Apes.  That was a bomb.  County fairs with the Planet of the Apes.  Nobody wanted to see Cornelius tap dancing.  Cornelius.  Jesus.  Yeah, and then Zero.  Why don't they make it in 3D?  Zero has a miscarriage.  That was a funny one.  Remember that?  She had like fucking miscarriage stuff on her little ape feet. 
[02:27:00]  Oh, yeah.  Good.  No 3D?  No, I'm glad.  Oh, fucking 3D.  The theater I was in, it isn't equipped for 3D.  What is Jimmy doing?  What is he doing?  What happened, Jimmy?  What happened?  What happened?  His aunt made me laugh. 
[02:27:30]  Now we have problems.  I love it.  Now we have problems.  Oh, God.  You want to hear the Troy audio?  Please.  You've got problems, I'm telling you.  This is 10 minutes.  I love how people speculate when we're like, yes, you're right.  Jimmy laughing gets me every time. 
[02:28:00]  Oh, that was a fucking home run.  Oh, good God.  Well, I guess Sam has the audio of Troy Kwan losing his mind as he was screening calls.  Oh, we like this. 
[02:28:30]  Check and see if it's playing.  Oh, boy.  Oh, sweet.  You shit.  What happened?  You can't use Apple TV?  Yeah, what?  Are you taking a bite out of that Apple or something?  Oh, boy.  It's not working.  What happened?  If you have a problem with them, tell them to a fucking man and man up and tell them  yourself or don't bother calling. 
[02:29:00]  Because I don't give a fuck.  I don't give a fuck.  Then go.  If you have a problem with them, then tell them.  Oh, Nate, what's your name?  Where are you calling from?  What do you got?  What was the guy's problem?  He really does get in passion.  Yeah.  The guy thought that you were doing a sports break that you had done before.  Who cares?  Troy, obviously. 
[02:29:30]  He didn't even like the bullshit.  The guy's mad because we redid something we did before?  Right.  We did it differently this time.  And he wanted Troy to go in and be like, shut the fuck up.  Oh, and hey, you did this already.  And Troy was like, fuck you, dude.  Ah, here comes Troy.  This happens all the time.  So you guys will be doing something and this guy will call up and say, not necessarily this  guy exactly, but other people like him.  You might as well just say this guy.  And he's like, you tell them they already fucking did this bid.  I paid for this service. 
[02:30:00]  Tell them to do something else.  And I said, are you going to tell them this?  Are you just telling the call screener this?  And he's like, I'm telling you this.  I said, why are you telling me this?  I don't give a shit.  Like, if you want to tell them, tell them.  Yeah.  But I'm not going to stop the show and come in here and say, hey, hang on a second, guys.  This jerk off on the phone says that you did this bid already and you need to stop.  I don't know what these callers think.  Well, they don't.  Well, that's why I become infuriated.  It's like you're getting angry at retarded children for shitting themselves. 
[02:30:30]  Right.  You should understand that.  That's going to happen.  Sometimes it's a reflex.  They try to stop things from going in there.  Oh, Uncle Paul.  That trick never works.  So we do the same breaks a lot.  But then we, I guarantee it's going to bore people.  But more people are hearing it for the first time than are hearing it for the second time.  Right.  And secondly, we always add some more shit to it. 
[02:31:00]  Yeah.  I mean, but Jimmy is still.  Oh, fuck it.  That was a dude.  Why am I talking seriously?  It's so hard.  It's a talk.  All right, Troy.  Good job.  Troy, you.  We'll get you off the phone soon before you have a heart attack.  Hang in there.  He is not the same Troy I knew.  No, he's had it.  He's had it.  You know what?  And we've been through call screeners where after two, three months, they're gone. 
[02:31:30]  They have to be transferred out.  It's like doing a double tour of duty somewhere.  Absolutely.  Oh, man.  He's just laughing.  Jimmy is like watching a little baby.  It's like watching a little chuckling baby.  Are you guys ready for another Dr. Drew success story? 
[02:32:00]  Something we like doing on the show.  Yes.  Sam, do you want to explain this?  Yeah.  Well, famous actor Eric Roberts.  Well, no, I explained the whole Dr. Drew thing.  Oh, well, Dr. Drew has now.  Fuck it.  I'll do it.  Celebrity Rehab and Sober House, two shows that Dr. Drew do.  He has all these success stories, kind of like dead wrestlers.  Right.  Yeah.  Like they come out of Dr. Drew's care better and having learned from the process.  Who are some of the success stories? 
[02:32:30]  Well, there was Mike Starr from Alice in Chains.  Kenickie.  Kenickie.  From fucking, okay.  Both of those guys.  Hexing.  Wait, two Alice in Chains guys have died?  No, no, no.  Kenickie was not in Alice in Chains.  Well, yeah.  No, no, no.  But I mean Lane Staley.  Oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Mike Starr.  There was, you know, Dennis Rodman is a success story, I think.  He's drinking his ass off.  Yeah.  Now that he's out of there.  Yeah.  Who else?  I don't know.  We had a whole list at one point.  We did have a whole list.  I remember that season. 
[02:33:00]  Anyway, another Dr. Drew success story.  Good old Eric Roberts.  Yes.  Julia Roberts' brother.  Oh, yeah.  He loves his pot.  What a troubled life.  He did the show saying that he had a dependency on medical marijuana.  Right.  Like, that was his celebrity rehab addiction.  That he needed to get over.  Oh, my fat stomach.  And he went through graduation?  Oh, yeah.  He went through graduation and he was a model student.  Like, he was, like, inspirational to the people around him. 
[02:33:30]  So, he was done.  He's off the pot, right?  Dr. Drew helped him out.  Well, Ant, this came out yesterday.  Hi, I'm Eric Roberts.  There are many things I hold near and dear to my heart.  Things I'd like to see changed.  So, you'll be hearing a lot from me.  Today, we're talking about the legalization of marijuana.  Well, maybe it's...  Dr. Drew's got to close up shop.  I don't know.  He really has to close up shop.  Maybe he's doing this thing saying that it's a bad thing.  Oh, okay.  Fair enough. 
[02:34:00]  Oh.  Fair enough.  We didn't get to the point.  Because he had a dependency on medical marijuana.  That's true.  Maybe it's...  Fair enough.  ...legalization of marijuana.  How is alcohol legal and marijuana is not?  No.  Alcohol has destroyed whole civilizations, whereas pot has only made a few hippies happy.  Now, I know that's a gross understatement, but pot remains illegal because no one has  figured out how to make it profitable for the government yet.  It's political, not protective. 
[02:34:30]  I had a psychopharmacologist once tell me that there is an army of scientists working to  recreate a chemical that has the same effects on the central nervous system as THC.  What does that tell you?  We can use a lot more nice in the world.  Marijuana does that.  Jesus.  Boy, he...  I think Dr. Drew's happy today.  He loves his weed.  It's like Mary Carey giving up porn so she could be sober. 
[02:35:00]  Yep.  And then coming out with the Dr. Drew celebrity rehab porno version.  But that's not what Jimmy's laughing at.  No.  Jimmy's still laughing at something that happened 15 minutes ago.  Yeah, and I'm also laughing at a Twitter...  Yeah.  ...plow to the Apes suggested movie, which probably won't be right over there, but Washington,  D.C.  Oh, okay.  It's not appropriate.  I got you.  So there you go.  Eric Roberts.  Wow.  Another success. 
[02:35:30]  Don't forget it.  I just read this one.  Granny gets her hat removed by a player in the air.  Granny.  Jesus.  Jesus.  Oh, God damn. 
[02:36:00]  Jonathan in Detroit.  Randy gets her hat.  He's on Planet of the Apes.  On Planet of the Apes.  I don't even know what that means.  It's just a very funny idea for a movie.  It's hilarious.  Oh, my God.  Hey, what's up, man? 
[02:36:30]  Anthony, I must say that as an African-American, I find you fucking hilarious.  Thank you, sir.  It's funny because, you know, you probably get the callers every once a month saying, oh,  you're racist and this and that.  Once a month.  Once a month.  I make that call for more than once a week.  I know, I know, but honestly, I find it hilarious, and I think it's all in how you say it.  You know, I think when it comes down to it, I think some of the things that you're thinking  is pretty commonplace for everybody. 
[02:37:00]  Yeah, I think so.  It's not done out of hatred or anything like that.  It's, you know, I'm just a bitter fuck.  What do I want?  What do you want from me?  Or something like that.  Oh, I think we, you know, as African-Americans, I think, fuck it, we ain't ourselves, too,  so.  It is what it is.  I think everybody has that, you know, this pain in their mouth.  But I just wanted to know the joke that you guys are laughing at, because I, honestly,  I find it hilarious, you know, like, just say it. 
[02:37:30]  Just, honestly, we already said it.  It was just that we were listing Planet of the Apes movies, just all the silly ones,  like, bawling with Planet of the Apes, and fucking, what was it, buying a hat for,  like, just how silly it got.  The whole concept of that just made me laugh.  It's hilarious.  Yeah, because there was a bunch of them in a row we listed, and it was, like, just how  ridiculous Planet of the Apes got after a while.  I don't know why it made me laugh, the idea of bawling with the Planet of the Apes, or  dancing with Planet of the Apes, or just all of these ridiculous, there's one I forgot, 
[02:38:00]  I think.  Oh, I guess one thing I'll give Anthony definitely is that you're very creative in your African-American  jokes.  I try.  I love my African-Americans.  I think that's what makes it so funny, because if you're just like, oh, you know, just the  normal watermelon and chicken and whatever.  Oh, that's a good, I can't stand when you're trying to be a little funny like that, some 
[02:38:30]  racial humor, and then somebody just calls up and fucking really, yeah, just goes with  the basic bullshit, like, oh, God, really, please.  I hear you, my black friend.  All right, so you got listeners out here who are black who enjoy the show, so don't change  what you do, I'm not saying you would.  Thank you, Holmes.  Jonathan in Detroit, thanks.  Later, man.  All right.  Don't call here no more.  We don't need that type of talk on the show. 
[02:39:00]  Goddamn blacks calling all the shows, talking.  When I was a boy, my father would never allow that.  No, huh?  No, he caught me in a shed with an older black man, he yelled at him.  Wow, that's pretty bad.  Yeah.  He yelled at me.  Pauly Queermout, he was calling me.  Pauly Chocolate Bob Bottom.  All right, we're going to break, but before we do, we got something nice right here for 
[02:39:30]  everybody.  Something nice.  Is it a verbal suicide note by Eric?  I'm sorry, Eric.  I didn't even mean that.  Iraq just said.  I love Iraq.  I'm a big Iraq fan.  Who isn't?  We got this.  The Opie and Anthony Show is all about shameless self-promotion.  So why don't you just go ahead and follow us on Twitter.  Twitter.com slash Opie Radio.  Twitter.com slash Anthony Crumia.  And Twitter.com slash Jim Norton. 
[02:40:00]  This is The Opie and Anthony Show.  Yeah, right on, man.  We all like our Twitters.  You should follow us because the show continues after we get the fuck out of here.  Sometimes it gets better after we get the fuck out of here.  So right on, man.  Join Twitter.  Join us.  What is it?  Dopey Radio.  Opie Radio.  Opie Radio.  One word.  Then you got Anthony Cumia.  Right.  C-U-M-I-A.  I'm just spelling the tougher words here.  Yeah.  And Jim Norton. 
[02:40:30]  That's N-O-R-D-O-N.  Norton.  No.  What?  It's T.  Oh, Jim Norton, who's leaving us for Hollywood in a little while.  But yeah, fucking join Twitter and start following us.  We do all sorts of weird shit after the show.  Oh, man.  We haven't promoted that in a while.  A bunch of shit going on after we get off the air.  Yeah.  Everyone's involved.  Hey, fair enough, Shane.  Nixon in Birmingham, Alabama.  I'm not a fan of Dr. Drew.  No. 
[02:41:00]  Nah.  I'm not either.  I think he loves the attention.  I think he loves being a little rock star himself out there.  He loves it.  But Shane makes a good point, and maybe Jimmy will back this up.  Ope, again, Dr. Drew just gives them the tools.  It's up to them.  And this guy was out of rehab class.  Of the ten he was in with, Jimmy, six are dead.  Two are in prison.  And me and another guy have been clean for six years.  It's tough, man.  I think he's right. 
[02:41:30]  I mean, fair enough, because we do beat up Dr. Drew and all that.  I like Dr. Drew.  I don't think he does anything wrong, because even though it's a TV show, and it does go  for attention and stuff, and the editing is a certain way, I think he's a sincere guy.  I think he does care about the people doing well, and I don't think it hurts anybody to  be on, too.  I don't think it hurts addiction to have a show like that.  Did you read the article in the paper?  I didn't know.  You just said something that one of the creators of Celebrity Rehab said.  What's his name?  Bob?  Oh, yeah.  I actually did read what he said.  I'm sorry.  Bob what?  Yeah, I did read that.  Bob Fosse?  Yeah. 
[02:42:00]  Fosse?  Something like that?  Burn victim wig, yeah.  I know who you mean.  Burn victim wig.  He was in a band, and he was a heroin addict, and he created Celebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew,  and he says he doesn't like what the show has become because of the editing.  Yeah, yeah, I did see that, and I think that's where I got that from.  I haven't watched this season.  Have they really gotten crazy with the editing and the teasing and all that, Sam?  Yeah, it's kind of ridiculous.  Every single commercial break, you think the entire house is going to self-destruct, and  then they come back, and everybody's like, okay, it was a misunderstanding.  Yeah, they do that all the time with reality shows. 
[02:42:30]  They're just using something that's like a real problem and making a scripted drama out  of it.  It's retarded.  It is kind of, you know, like being a vulture.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  And I'll say it again.  I mean, they're all addicted to fame.  That's why they go on the show, but Dr. Drew doesn't want to acknowledge that part  of it.  Like, why would you put yourself out there in front of millions of people like this?  Mm-hmm.  Wouldn't you deal with that privately, Jimmy? 
[02:43:00]  Would you ever go on a rehab show like that?  No, I would not, but again, I'm not a reality show junkie.  I turned down Celebrity Fit Club.  You know, I needed the money.  That's when I was getting sued, so I was like, I'm panicking at that point, but I'm glad  I didn't do it.  Yeah.  Yeah, because when you do things, they can't be...  I look at like Last Comic Standing guys, and a lot of those guys still do pretty well  on the road, or do very well.  But it's like, if you're going to expose yourself, you want it to be for more than like a one  or two year bump.  Like, you want it to be like, wow, something that really takes you to the next... 
[02:43:30]  Like, what Flava Flav did, that to me is what reality stuff can do for you.  Like, that's where it's great.  Like, he went on to the fucking surreal life, and then he does what another season, Flavor  of Love, and then Flavor and Brigitte.  And it got to be a bit much, but he's just a...  I mean, he was famous before.  A lot of flavors.  But yeah.  Get it?  Yeah, it's all the same thing.  Chocolates.  What, what, uh, what, what rehab, Jesus, what reality show would you go on?  I don't know.  If they asked.  Would you do Dance with the Stars? 
[02:44:00]  Yeah, of course.  They would never ask me about Biggin' Up.  Absolutely.  Just because of the numbers?  That's a massive show.  And it's, it's, it's, to me, that's a fun show, even though I don't watch it.  How could you dance?  Exactly.  Couldn't do that.  But that, to me, is like, they're just getting celebrities to dance.  I mean, that's kind of harmless.  It doesn't...  I would absolutely do it, but they wouldn't ask me to.  Would you, uh, do, uh, the Jersey Shore?  Yeah, I'd be on that if they asked me, of course.  Nine million fuckin' people.  That show's not dead yet, eh?  No, no, no, it's not a, it's getting bigger.  And remember, they were gonna cancel. 
[02:44:30]  Me and Jimmy were talking about this in the bathroom yesterday.  They were gonna cancel that fuckin' show because they were getting, you know, pressure from  all the special interest groups.  Yeah.  And MTV hung in there and said, fuck y'all.  Not only are we not canceling the show, we're not gonna change the show.  Fuck all y'all.  Fuck all y'all.  The creator of it is a guy named Tony DeSanto, who, uh, we live in the same, I've done it  for years.  He was always very nice to me on MTV when he put me in sketches and whatever.  And I saw him on the elliptical.  We both have the same elliptical workout, like two girls. 
[02:45:00]  But he got on the other day, and I'm like, fuckin' nine million viewers?  He's like, yeah, no, it's great.  And he's not there anymore.  But I said, uh, I can't believe you were so smart to stick with that and not buckle when  the Italian groups were pressuring you to do that.  And he's like, yeah, they kind of wanted us.  There was a lot of people that wanted us to not do the show.  Yeah.  And to buckle.  And, uh, MTV stuck with it.  But he had to fight for it.  And if he didn't fight for it, but that's what happens when you don't listen to special  interest groups.  That's what, if they would have listened, they would have shut that down in the first 
[02:45:30]  year.  I didn't think it was going to make it because the advertisers were going to leave.  I believe there's a lot of good TV out there waiting to happen if people would just follow  their gut and not, you know, listen to anybody.  Don't listen to the fuckin' corporate lawyers.  Don't listen to the special interest groups.  And let these talented, creative people do what they do best.  They go, all the bullshit, it goes away after a while.  Right.  The interest groups aren't going to stand there protesting for a year. 
[02:46:00]  You know, give them a couple of days and they're bored and gone.  I was having a discussion over the weekend.  How many really bad movies, right, that we know, you can start naming them off in your  head.  Caddyshack 2.  Okay.  Well, maybe that's a bad example.  But just really horrendously bad movies that were unbelievably good on paper and then got  fucked up by Hollywood producers, maybe casting the wrong people.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  Where people read this shit like, this is the next Caddyshack or the next whatever, whatever 
[02:46:30]  comedy you really loved and enjoyed.  And then it turns out to be the biggest piece of shit.  And none of us know that it was unbelievable on paper.  Yeah.  Hmm.  I wonder if we could ever get someone on the show to discuss that.  Because you know when it goes through all the filters, they fuck up so much shit  that probably was really, really good.  Elliptical, Jimmy?  The elliptical?  The elliptical.  I gave up on that shit.  I'm still disgusted with my fucking pig body.  But I don't see how you burn calories if there's no gravity involved. 
[02:47:00]  Because you're still using your...  It's better for your legs.  Resistance.  Have you done the elliptical there?  I'm not a big elliptical guy.  I'm treadmill and weights.  I'm not feeling anything.  Wait.  You're floating in air.  No, no, no.  If you put on a higher setting and you're using your arms, that's a brutal workout.  I mean, you burn a few hundred calories doing that.  She blinded me with science!  Do, do, do, do, do.  She blinded me with science!  It's a mace.  I know.  Look at that guy.  The song of the rapist.  It really is.  I have to do that every time now. 
[02:47:30]  Guy walks down the hallway.  It's Thomas Dolby.  Swear to God.  I'm Thomas Dolby.  Sambo, you watching the Jersey Shore?  Uh, yes.  The fucking chicks are broken, huh?  Yeah.  I mean...  They're all pigs now.  What happened to them?  They're famous.  Sammy Sweetheart there is bloated.  Dean is just a fucking pig.  They don't have to take care of themselves anymore.  JWoww got anorexic, so now her boobs look ridiculous, and she's got some kind of Botox 
[02:48:00]  thing happening with her face, right?  Yeah, she looks horrible.  JWoww, I mean, she doesn't look like the same person that we met.  No, these girls are, uh, they're fucking just not looking good, eh?  Yeah, it's taking its toll.  I think so.  Is that what's happening?  I think so.  It's because they're also, like, they're paid to party over and over and over and over again,  and on, you know, Snooki and What's-Her-Face, Dina, that's taking its toll, and JWoww's  just going the opposite direction. 
[02:48:30]  Here we go, Ant, going back to the other thing.  We're all over the place.  Remember the movie The Ringer with Johnny Knoxville?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I bet you on paper that thing was unbelievable.  Sounds good.  Guy acts like he's retarded to be the ringer and win the Special Olympics.  What a great concept.  And then you know the special interest groups got wind of it, and then they caved to them  and said, okay, well, we got to, you know, make this a little more friendly toward, uh,  you know, uh, the thick tongues.  They actually went and got, uh, permission. 
[02:49:00]  The approval, right?  Approval, yeah.  I bet you that wasn't Johnny Knoxville's thinking when he wrote The Ringer or got involved with  The Ringer.  Probably not.  And they fucked it up, right?  Yeah.  Roots, very good, Josh.  Wow.  What was Roots?  That's a good idea on paper.  No.  Jersey Shore.  I just can't.  I can't.  Why not?  No.  It stinks.  And I know a lot of people fucking watched it, but... 
[02:49:30]  Vinny's going to be on the show soon.  And Uncle Nino.  Yeah, I want Uncle Nino.  I think he's hilarious.  I think he's the funniest fucking guy out of all of them, man.  I would, if I was MTV, I would do a lot of Nino shit.  Is he on the show?  Here and there, a little bit.  A little bit.  He visits one day and, you know, they show him when Vinny goes back home.  That's it.  And the situation...  Oh, another observation.  He is close to being a serial killer. 
[02:50:00]  Really?  Yeah, he's not right.  There's something wrong with that guy.  And that was also apparent going back a few, like, last season and stuff.  Anytime he doesn't get his way or if somebody else gets a girl that he wanted or whatever,  he just has this anger that completely snaps.  He's totally out of his head.  Dude, he's psychotic.  Really?  There's something wrong with...  Yeah, I'm telling you.  I'm saying it right now.  There's something wrong with that guy.  Yes.  I know we've had him on the show and he was so cool.  But watching this Jersey Shore, you realize he's not right.  No, he...  Something's going on with that guy. 
[02:50:30]  He has a couple drinks.  Anger problem.  He gets angry and all of a sudden he's a psychopath.  He might be one of those guys that just can't handle his alcohol so his whole personality changes.  But something is up with him.  You heard it here first.  Boom, boom, boom, boom.  Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.  Yes.  Schwung.  And yeah, JWoww looks almost like a marionette or something.  Yeah, she looks fake now.  Yeah, she's looking like...  I think she looks good, though.  She's got that porn star look.  It's all Hollywood.  Everything's kind of like plastic on her now.  Looks all Hollywood. 
[02:51:00]  Yeah, I mean, she's still hot, yeah.  But, I mean, she was kind of a natural beauty except for the fake tits she had.  But now...  Yeah.  Wow.  Oh.  What the hell is...  What the fuck was that?  Did you guys hear that out there?  Yeah.  Why is Bobo running around SiriusXM?  Was that Bobo?  Why is he here?  Well, he's here to do production.  Do you want me to find out why he's running around?  No, I don't want him on our show and I don't want him on the after show.  Sam, don't fucking do it, man. 
[02:51:30]  Why is he running through the hallway?  I was in here.  Can we find out why he was running?  Yes.  Sam, don't do it.  I won't bring him in here.  I will just find out why and then I will tell you.  Don't use that crutch.  You don't need Bobo on the 10 o'clock hour.  I'm telling you right now.  All right, he's banned.  I want to make sure nobody told him to run down the hall.  I'll go find out.  Sam's on it.  Jesus Christ.  Because there's some...  I don't think...  But if anyone told him to run down the hall...  You're ugly.  Yeah.  That's just... 
[02:52:00]  Jesus.  Is there a radio on out there?  Sorry.  There better not be a radio on out there.  Danny, why is Bobo here?  We had to record some stuff for production.  Oh, did you tell him he had to do it immediately?  Well, I said that...  Well, we were back in the office and Derek called and I said, well, yeah, we can come  down to the studio.  And on the way, I just thought we'd have a fun little race.  Oh.  And I said, Bobo, I bet you I could beat you to Derek's studio.  Oh, ready, set, go.  I lost.  What do you know?  Yeah.  I wish you would have gone headfirst into this class. 
[02:52:30]  Yeah, that's not smart because he's such a...  Bobo is the reason...  We're going to get fired because of Bobo.  He's going to fall and break his neck or run into somebody and go, he told me.  And we're going to get fucking shit canned.  He is just a fucking...  That fucking lunkhead should never be around here.  Lunkhead.  He's a firing waiting to happen because he's such a fucking...  Something stupid will happen.  He's going to run with a pen in his hand and stab somebody or hurt himself. 
[02:53:00]  And then his fucking family is going to say, you knew he was autistic.  Well, no, we didn't.  So what do you think?  We should never have Bobo on ever again?  Have him on, yeah.  We don't have him running.  Yeah.  I don't mind him on.  We want him walking gingerly around the place.  Not like everybody else.  But I don't mind him on the air.  I think he's...  We should just kick him off the show.  Horrendous.  Anthony, here's one.  Thank you, Predators 1998.  1941.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  This guy says...  That was funny.  Just to finish his tweet.  I read the book that the studio released and laughed my ass off.  The movie stinks. 
[02:53:30]  And they're basically identical.  Wow, that's something.  Yeah, that didn't make any sense, that movie.  But I bet you there's a lot of those out there.  Yeah.  They just wanted to put Belushi in something.  They'd listen to you because Bobo's running.  What does he say?  But you see Bobo running out of the hallway?  It's like, that's the type of thing that is so fucking stupid.  I just hope he gets fucking thrown out of the building.  Let's just say...  That sounds dumb.  But he fucking runs into somebody coming around the corner and knocks them into the window. 
[02:54:00]  It's...  Say it.  Just say what you want to say.  It's dumb.  Mel just happens to be down on the floor.  You know what?  Oh, my God.  Turns the corner and Bobo runs into him.  It's funny you say that.  I did actually think Mel.  I know.  That's why I said it.  But it's not going to be anything dramatic as Mel.  That won't happen.  It's going to be some chick that fucking works in one of the offices or is a fucking payroll  person who walks around the corner.  And that fucking dumb motherfucker runs into her while she's holding coffee and knocks 
[02:54:30]  into her.  If you walk into somebody, you'll walk into him.  But then he fucking goes, they told me to race and run.  You don't think if he hit Mel, it would end up like in big?  Where it's like, I like a...  God, it hustles around a little bit.  Why don't you come here?  I'll make it vice president.  No, huh?  No.  I'm not being paranoid.  That's the...  No, it is.  That's the type of shit that fucking no one sees coming and it gets you fucking dumped. 
[02:55:00]  I hate that no one sees coming.  Well, we know...  Yeah, we know we'll get dumped for something stupid.  But you know what I mean?  It's like that's...  He's the one.  Never have him do stuff that's out of the studio.  Like that's where he's going to get hurt.  Because he's a fucking kook.  Everybody knows that.  That he is.  Telling Rich Voss to do something or Bob Kelly, because they're...  I hate to say they're thinking guys, but they're regular dudes.  It's different.  Because they don't want to do it, they're not going to do it.  But a guy like that, man... 
[02:55:30]  He'll do anything.  You've got to be really careful with that.  I think we could legitimately get him to go up to the roof and jump off the roof of this building.  Yeah.  I bet we can talk him into doing that.  You've got to be so fucking careful with a guy like that.  Not when you can't make fun of him.  You'll be like, for the show.  But you know what I mean?  For the show.  Anybody who's that irrational...  Yeah.  You couldn't get him to kill himself, but you could get him to hurt himself.  Yeah, yeah.  You could get him to hurt himself.  Oh, you absolutely could. 
[02:56:00]  I think you'd get him to kill himself.  Really?  Either way, yeah.  Yeah.  I think so.  For the show.  For the show.  For the show.  Yeah.  Did you hear about this Jackie Kennedy thing?  Oh, she's fucking...  Her husband got shot.  These tapes?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Are the tapes going to be released, Dan?  I think so.  No.  Yeah.  I heard the headline, which is, for the people that haven't heard yet...  I have not.  Jackie O reportedly believed that LBJ was behind JFK's assassination. 
[02:56:30]  Yes.  LBJ and his Texas crony friends to get the gig.  Get the president gig.  And she truly believed that that's who had her husband killed.  That's pretty heavy.  Yeah.  Did she say it on her deathbed?  Do you know the details about this there?  Well, this is shortly after the assassination.  Yeah.  These are tapes that she made for history, historic purposes.  She said she didn't want them released until 50 years after her death. 
[02:57:00]  Why?  I would like to know why, too.  For what?  If you really believe that, that's kind of important.  Well, because...  She was probably scared for her own life, I would assume, right?  It said...  50 years after her death, her kids, too.  She ordered that they should not release the tapes until 50 years after her death with  some reports suggesting she feared that her revelations might make her family targets for revenge.  But she died 17 years ago from cancer at age 64.  But why do we have to listen to her? 
[02:57:30]  Who has the tapes that they're listening to?  Carolyn Kennedy has agreed to release the recordings early.  I see that bitch in a coffee shop every once in a while.  I'm going to shake her down next time and see if the tapes fall out.  Well, here was the deal.  Yeah.  Also, that's kind of odd.  She agreed to release the tapes to ABC if ABC agreed not to air the movie they had made  about the Kennedys.  Which starred Katie Holmes as Jackie.  Oh, right.  Stuff like that.  Was that a made-for-TV movie? 
[02:58:00]  Yes.  Oh, yeah.  It was a miniseries.  Yeah, one of the miniseries.  I'd rather hear Jackie's tapes than a movie.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Again, even though Jackie might have thought LBJ was behind it, it doesn't mean anything.  She could think.  She also reveals an affair with actor Bill Holden.  William Holden was fucking her.  William Holden was fucking her.  She did it in retaliation for her husband's many flings and filandering.  Wait, he fucked her while...  She fucked him while JFK was president? 
[02:58:30]  Yes.  Well, Bill Holden's a dummy.  Why would you take that chance?  William Holden!  Lucy just freaking out, creaming over Bill Holden.  He was handsome.  But how did we find out about that?  Carolyn's talking?  No, Jackie.  On the tapes.  Jackie said to reveal...  So who's heard these tapes?  I guess the guy who recorded them and did some kind of an interview with her, but then  the tapes were locked away.  So why doesn't the guy talk?  He obviously is a little bit. 
[02:59:00]  They were in his tapes, I guess.  Yeah, but he...  They were in the Kennedy Library or something, locked in a vault in Boston.  How about we get them?  Yeah.  How about the lady that was closest to the shot?  No kidding.  We at least hear from.  Yeah.  It kind of annoys you that she did that because she didn't have anything to say about it after.  It was like, why didn't you say that then?  Nobody's going to kill you then.  I think she was afraid.  I can see where she might be afraid.  She had her fucking husband's brains on her lap.  Yeah, I guess so.  Yeah, that might do.  That'll influence you a little bit.  That might shake you up a little bit. 
[02:59:30]  Yeah.  We're just going to get the conspiracy guys going ballistic.  Oh, shit.  I'm going to love this.  Read into every word she says.  I don't think she has any facts or just a belief.  Yeah.  Yeah.  When do we get to hear these at?  I think she just has belief.  I don't know.  When they are released.  But no hint when that is?  Not yet.  September.  September?  Yeah.  Well, thank you, sir.  And ABC also says that everything in that Daily Mail story, which is what you guys are  talking about, is not true. 
[03:00:00]  You know what?  I hate the English papers.  I hate their newspapers.  No, I hate the English.  Oh, yeah.  And I hate their newspapers.  Because they are just these fucking bullshit rag magazines like fucking Weekly World News  used to be.  Why?  What are they saying is fake?  They just released a statement that said the tabloid reports about the content of the  tapes are totally erroneous.  They wouldn't say what isn't true, but it says ABC News isn't releasing any content from  those tapes until mid-September, at which point it will be clear how off-base these reports 
[03:00:30]  are.  Really?  And let me tell you something about ABC.  Know why mid-September?  Ratings.  Oh, yeah.  It's called sweeps.  Yeah.  Save it for the sweeps.  Hmm.  Well, I wonder what is erroneous and what is true.  Do you ever wonder how much of this shit they tell us is real?  Yeah.  That's just bullshit.  Seriously.  Because usually when I see in English, like, DailyMail.co.uk, I just don't even fucking 
[03:01:00]  read it.  But I mean in general.  The stuff you go through life thinking is real, how much of that stuff is just complete  bullshit?  It's nice language.  You know?  Not the biggies.  Like, I believe in the moon landing and all that crap.  But stuff that you just would swear is true is just not.  I'm trying to think of an example.  There was a weird thing where they were saying that the stitching on baseball caps sucks. 
[03:01:30]  It sucks.  I can't do it out loud.  Why?  The stitching in baseball caps was not being done by hand as promised.  Your face starts to scrunch from the chin up.  How can you tell?  When you're about to lie.  I'm a terrible liar.  You're horrible at it.  All right.  Well, I guess we'll all have to wait now.  Yeah, fuck yeah.  Do you think there's any truth to that, Ant? 
[03:02:00]  I don't know.  I don't know.  See, what Jackie O had was grace.  Pizazz?  Is that a Seinfeld thing?  No, it's grace.  Of course it is.  What else would it do?  Dude, I told you, man.  I did a lot of night radio.  I missed the Seinfeld years.  All fucking Seinfeld all the time.  Travis is laughing somewhere.  Of course I am.  That's all I watch.  Elaine didn't have grace.  No, she didn't.  Do I have?  Grace.  Fucking hilarious. 
[03:02:30]  Yeah, I don't know.  I don't think she would have gone out and said that she fucked fucking Bill Holden.  You know?  The tapes are being released to coincide with a book.  Forwarded by Caroline Kennedy.  Caroline's making a few bucks.  Now the family's dwindling.  By the way, she's an ugly broad in person.  Oh, yeah.  I still like her ass.  Would you?  Just for the story?  It's actually horrible teeth.  For the story or for the...  For anything.  I just look her at.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[03:03:00]  That family didn't have a good dentist.  You would think a dentist could...  Sure they did.  Oswald.  From...  Sirhan Sirhan Sirhan.  Yes.  Yeah, he did a little fucking...  A little flossing in the kitchen.  Oh, shit.  God, that's great.  She's all right when she keeps her mouth closed, but...  Jesus.  She's a gummy gal.  She's a gal with lots of gums to offer. 
[03:03:30]  Doesn't have, like, stalker patty mouth.  Yeah.  Rich woman with big gums...  Yeah.  ...seeks friend to build dam.  What is that?  Let's say hi to Tim in Jersey.  Tim, have you been calling off and on all morning?  Be honest.  No, no, no.  All right.  No, I just...  This is my first call today.  Speaker phones, sir.  We hate them.  Yeah, we hate speaker phones, on principle.  Because the queer uses it.  Okay.  Basically, I'm calling.  I saw this show on HBO last night, and it was, like, the most ridiculous thing of all. 
[03:04:00]  It's a documentary called Superheroes.  I'll take the heroes.  I'm sorry?  No.  I can't hear such a...  I'm sorry.  I like a hero sandwich.  Go ahead, sir.  It's the most ridiculous thing.  It's basically normal people dressing up like superheroes and going out and trying to do  vigilante justice.  And there's this guy on there, and he's like, yeah, I got this cooler in the back. 
[03:04:30]  He's got, like, a white rape band.  He's got a cooler in the back with...  He's like, yeah, I can't tell you why I'm any kid.  He's got a freezer pop.  And then he's like, yeah, I got some beverages for me.  And he cracks out a beer, and he's, like, a total alcoholic.  Is it a documentary?  Yeah, it's a documentary.  I've heard that it's pretty good.  A few people have told me to check it out.  Yeah, it's pretty crazy.  Yeah.  That looks stupid. 
[03:05:00]  I don't wear masks or anything.  Morons.  The show I want to watch is My Strange Addiction.  Ant, you watched this one, right?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I saw the woman that eats rocks.  Our old pal Stunt Brain wrote me.  Yeah.  I think it was yesterday.  You might be watching the show.  Last night had two wild episodes.  The first one on at 10 p.m.  I did not see this.  Had a woman in her 20s married to a guy who died suddenly.  He was cremated, and she carries his ashes everywhere. 
[03:05:30]  That's her addiction.  What a cunt.  But has also started eating them.  Ah, yeah, there you go.  And she can't stop.  Can we find a clip from this show, Sam?  She'll stop soon enough.  I don't know how fat he was.  Yeah.  If you look like Travis, she'll be done in a couple of days.  And, you know.  Well, yeah, we know.  She could be eating until the cows come home, as it were, from someone else.  Imagine trying to carry U-Rocks fucking ashes around every day.  Holy shit.  A little like some window. 
[03:06:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  I feel like being in fucking Washington State in 1980.  I'm saying, oh, it's...  You got a clip from it?  Um...  Oh, my God.  This guy has the worst TV on YouTube.  Oh, it's horrible.  Look at this horrendous TV.  And he's shaking.  It looks like the Nageltron.  Yeah, why is it...  Why is fucking Roland with a wig on? 
[03:06:30]  That was the woman eating the ashes.  And you watch My Strange Addiction?  Yeah.  Did you see the one with the black lady?  They're usually...  Like, half of them are black ladies.  Stunt Brain says, uh...  Black woman who bathes in bleach every single day.  Mmm.  Uh-huh.  Go get her.  Uh...  Seen the woman licking her finger and dipping it into the ashes and then into her mouth.  Well, now he's back to the other one.  Gotta be seen and be believed.  There has to be clips somewhere.  There you go.  Do you think it's actual ashes?  From her dead fucking boyfriend? 
[03:07:00]  Or are they just...  Probably.  Was there a switch?  The old switcheroo.  Here it is.  My Strange Addiction, TLC.  Give a dramatic opener.  Get it?  Finish.  Casey, I'm 26 years old.  I'm from Fayetteville, Tennessee.  And I'm addicted to carrying around my husband's urn.  How much did he earn?  I knew that was coming.  I take my husband everywhere.  To the grocery store. 
[03:07:30]  Shopping.  Ooh, babe, look at that.  Pause that.  Because I'll tell you where she doesn't take her husband's urn.  To the gym.  How about you prop that fucking vat of ashes up on a fucking treadmill.  That's how man.  Can you go back further?  Why is she eating her husband's ashes?  I wonder if he died of age.  She's trying to drop a few pounds.  Hoping this will rub off.  She talks to the urn.  Yeah, that's why I told Santa back up.  You know what, dude?  Dude, you know.  Yeah, she's talking to her. 
[03:08:00]  I take my husband everywhere.  To the grocery store.  Shopping.  Ooh, babe, look at that.  That's neat.  To the movies.  Out to eat.  She's got to pay?  Anywhere I go, he goes.  I sleep with him.  Hold on.  Pause.  Did she just put a seatbelt around the ashes?  Yeah, she buckled in the urn so it wouldn't fly through the windshield.  If I just want to stop short and have her husband spill all over the fucking BMW mats.  Spill all over the mats. 
[03:08:30]  Yeah.  How awful is that?  Your fucking, your beloved is in the rug, all with dog shit and fucking cat hairs.  A McDonald's wrapper.  A McDonald's wrapper.  A French fry or two.  Or probably quite a few.  I don't know why I hate this woman.  That's really sad.  That she's really lonely.  Get the fuck out of here.  She's lonely.  Let's see.  Let's see if it gets sad.  Anywhere I go, he goes.  I sleep with him.  I'm like, baby, I love you.  When I go grocery shopping, I buy the foods that he likes.  Why? 
[03:09:00]  When I cook, I cook what he likes.  Why?  I don't eat it.  But I cook for him.  If I'm watching TV, he's there with me.  You want to watch this?  Can you pull out this, please?  If somebody says, hey.  She just turned to the box and went, you want to watch this?  This fat idiot.  You know what it is?  She understands how hard it's going to be to replace him.  Yeah.  She's a fat show.  I get it.  She knows she got lucky and she's not going to get lucky twice.  She's treating that the way I would treat.  Say there was a stripper whose big problems in life was that her pussy was too big to fit 
[03:09:30]  in her pants and she drooled a lot while she sucked dick.  And if she died, I'd probably carry her ashes around too and talk to them.  Her pussy wouldn't fit in her pants.  She had their special pants because she was really skinny, but her pussy just wouldn't  fit in her trousers.  You also saw that you put lettuce in the refrigerator.  You know, that's rotting.  Oh, yeah.  Of course.  Because that was his favorite.  He used to eat that.  Yeah, not her.  The turkey burgers for him that she won't eat?  Puddle of AIDS got the kicker to this whole thing if it's not in the video. 
[03:10:00]  So, go ahead.  But I cook for him.  If I'm watching TV, he's there with me.  Do you want to watch this?  No.  If somebody says, hey, who is that?  I'm like, oh, this is my husband.  Some people laugh.  They think I'm playing.  If she wants attention.  But I'm serious.  It's my husband.  Casey and Sean were married in 2009 after dating for 10 months.  Hold on a second.  Oh, boy.  What crime was he shot in the commissioners?  Yeah. 
[03:10:30]  I want to know how he suddenly died.  He's a black guy, but he'd have to marry the fat white girl.  Jesus, dude.  He's a better looking guy than she is.  How can you tell that he's now ashes?  I wonder if eating the ashes, she gets lead poisoning.  She probably got shot.  Or how about if she just put some fucking cocoa butter on the ashes, all of a sudden a real  person would appear?  I was just dry, honey.  Yeah, Pat writes from Menaki, instant husband, just say I want it. 
[03:11:00]  Yeah, very good, sir.  Dating for 10 months.  Everything I had ever wanted in a man was right in front of me, and it felt so great.  They fell in love.  Was he a giant cupcake?  The soulmates from day one.  Oh, the mother.  Two and a half years that they were together, I think, was the only time that Casey was  truly, truly happy.  Their marriage was picture perfect until Sean suffered a severe asthma attack two months  ago.  Picture perfect. 
[03:11:30]  The doctor came in.  He probably was fucking, he had an asthma attack carrying her lunch up the steps.  You know how mad he was that she fucking put on all that weight?  It was picture perfect.  Yeah.  Unless he was hitting her, yelling, fat bitch.  Stay home.  The doctor came in, and the look on his face was telltale. 
[03:12:00]  Yes, he was happy for the guy.  The day my world stopped turning.  The day my life fell apart.  Oh, baby, I miss you.  Though Casey initially found comfort by having her husband's ashes.  That box actually has her shoes in them, and she hasn't seen them since she bought them.  So she's hugging them.  She misses them.  I miss you guys so much.  I've seen you in soul.  Her shoes are just crying in the box. 
[03:12:30]  Please leave us in here.  Don't put us on those ham hocks with toes on them.  Please don't put those fleshy battleships in us again.  Stitching's all burst out.  Her shoes.  I bet she loses shoes because they run away.  Her shoes just run away.  Hang themselves in the closet door.  At her side, her addiction has recently evolved. 
[03:13:00]  Uh-oh.  I guess with the transfer of his cremains, you know, some got into the cardboard box as well.  And they spilled out on my hands.  And I didn't want to wipe them off because that's my husband.  I don't want to wipe him away.  So I just licked it off my fingers.  Like you do everything else.  Like cake batter, my husband's ashes, paint thinner, fucking marmalade.  She loves licking stuff off those pudgy fingers. 
[03:13:30]  She looks like a fucking aardvark, fucking attacking an anthill.  Anything that gets on those fat fingers is fair game.  I ate my wedding ring.  I ate the remote control because it was by my fingers.  One time my fingers brushed a cheesecake and I ate the entire box, including the cardboard.  Fucking monster.  She's a food addiction.  Yeah.  She just snacks on her husband when she's out of other stuff.  You think this is real?  Yeah.  I hope so.  I, I, I, I, yeah, I think. 
[03:14:00]  Okay.  What a creep.  So I just licked it off my fingers and here I am today, almost two months later, and I can't stop.  I'm eating my husband.  Come on.  Jesus Christ.  Just kill her.  That's disgusting.  Just kill her.  What use does she have for the rest of us? 
[03:14:30]  None.  Um, so Puddle of AIDS, who runs a really good website called tedwilliamshead.com if you're  into sports blogs.  Oh.  Really, he does a very good job.  And he puts all this stuff up there.  You want to guess how, her, her husband weighed six pounds, the ashes.  Yeah.  Want to guess, uh, what he weighs now?  Uh-oh.  He's losing weight.  How much she ate?  Yeah.  Um, like a pound.  Give yourself a belt.  Third pound left. 
[03:15:00]  No, no, no.  She's eating a pound.  Oh, she's eating a pound of her husband.  So now her husband's down to five pounds.  Five pounds.  She's eating a pound of ashes already.  Wow.  God.  In two months.  What the fuck is that one about, Jimmy?  You know this shit a little bit.  She's a food addict that she just can't let go.  But it's hard, you know what?  It's, it's like, I have more sympathy for her because it's only been two months and a sudden  asthma attack and the guy's just dead.  And she's a big fat lady and she had a, that's a rough one.  I'm not saying that she's not a.  How much did you miss someone that you only knew for two years?  That's a good point. 
[03:15:30]  But.  Is it?  Yeah, it is.  It's not like they were together 15, 20 years.  But it's so sudden.  She probably saw their whole life.  Thank God he wasn't around to see this shit.  Then again, he had to die for her to do this.  You think when they met, he realized she'll be eating me someday?  Probably.  There were probably some kind of signs.  Yeah, she'd be nibbling on his toes like macadamias.  Probably pulling skin off his body while he slept or something, yeah.  That's fucking disgusting. 
[03:16:00]  Macadamias.  Fucking crazy people, though.  I saw some woman eating a rock.  You can't eat a rock.  That's impossible.  Yeah.  She, she would gather up these rocks.  But the rocks I saw.  Swallow them or chew them?  No, she would.  No, that's impossible.  But there was a certain type of rock that I remember seeing somewhere in, like, the north,  like, like in South Dakota and shit.  It's got a lot of mica in it.  And they're, they're almost like, you crumble very easily.  Your body can tell you're pregnant before you can. 
[03:16:30]  Oh, no.  Of course it can.  Yeah, they're very crumbly.  And she eats those.  Really?  Yeah.  Rocks?  And she goes out to the side of the road and just looks for rocks and finds them and  just starts eating them.  And people are like, people ask me if, you know, animal goes to the bathroom on it.  Who cares?  Goes to the bathroom.  Animal doesn't go to the bathroom.  Does she wash it first?  No.  She likes the, the dirt taste.  Is this her?  Yeah.  This is a fucking, another, another slaw. 
[03:17:00]  I'm addicted to eating rocks.  What a fat neck.  I don't think I would be able to function every day if I didn't eat some quantity of rocks.  Teresa has been addicted to eating rocks for more than 20 years.  She was initially attracted to the earthy smell.  I was just out walking one day.  I had no intention of fighting into it or chewing it.  But I did. 
[03:17:30]  And once I did that, I was hooked on them.  Now, Teresa can't go more than a few hours without eating rocks.  I'm not just hanging out with this fucking piss.  The grittiness of it and the earthy taste.  She's fucking nibbling a rock.  It's on my face when I'm crunching them up.  I'm very worried about Teresa.  When your body can't handle what you're putting inside of it, it's going to rebel against you.  Teresa's favorite type of rock is a mixture of several minerals, including granite. 
[03:18:00]  Yeah.  She uses a hammer to break them up into bite-sized pieces.  This is about the size I like it because it's not as hard to swallow.  Me too.  I would normally take a piece like this and normally just put it in my mouth or bite on it.  Or just put the whole piece in my mouth.  Oh, how great it would be if she choked.  That would be fantastic.  She's giving it a blowjob.  Get the earthy taste off of it.  Ow. 
[03:18:30]  Isn't that hard to watch her chew, biting into a rock?  No.  Eats up to two pounds of rocks a day.  You know what her shits must be like?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  It doesn't bother me.  What a pig.  She's giant rock dumps.  Splash!  In the toilet.  It's like a fucking depth charge going off.  Her fucking shits all look like the thing from the Fantastic Four.  What a fucking creep.  I hate those people.  I do, too.  I just hope she chokes on a rock.  Someone has to deal with that shit. 
[03:19:00]  She'd probably be great to have in the yard by the pool, though.  You would never step on pebbles.  Right.  That's good.  Snacking away.  On your heel.  Anything worse than stepping on a pebble with your heel.  Terrible.  But you know, like family get-togethers, Thanksgiving or something, they put out a plate of rocks for  this beast.  You think they do that?  Of course.  There's always enablers.  We all have them in our families.  Stuffing's just like fucking driveway gravel.  Shovel it into the turkey. 
[03:19:30]  No one makes her cook at all.  No.  She just puts rocks in everything.  Here.  Here's a pound cake.  It's a pound of rocks.  Dummy.  It's a brick.  I just like to chew.  You imagine fucking sitting there and talking to her about something, and she's fucking gnawing  on a rock?  I'd have to go, will you stop doing that?  You're doing.  You're annoying.  Quit eating rocks, miss.  Fucking big fat Churchill, Nick. 
[03:20:00]  I hate her.  There's plenty of those, though.  I've seen my strange addiction.  Probably everyone.  There's some black chick that's with some white guy.  No, no.  This one, she just walks around with a pillow all the time, and she's had the pillow since  she was a kid when she was sexually assaulted by an uncle or something, and I guess the  pillow was like the only thing, like if she's getting railed, she fucking just looked  at the pillow, and now that pillow is like her savior.  He probably put it over her face to keep her quiet, and it gets her wet when she holds 
[03:20:30]  it.  She remembers her uncle's dick fucking removing her childhood in one awful swipe.  Mm-hmm.  I dated a girl who would always have a little pillow like that.  Really?  Yep.  She dragged it around with her?  No, but she suffered.  Just throw the pillow away.  What's going to happen to her?  I would love to.  She takes it everywhere.  I know that when I touch it, everything is going to be better.  Tamara has been addicted to her pillow since she was four years old.  That's what it smells like at this point.  She carries it at least 18 hours a day and treats it as a best friend. 
[03:21:00]  Dicky.  Well, my pillow actually has a name, and it's Boo.  Hey, Boo.  Boo got shot.  Boo got shot.  That's the main thing.  Who wants to date her?  Some dopey white guy.  He's a big muscle head.  My pillow goes in the car with me.  Grocery store, movie theaters, daily walks.  Oh, shit.  I don't bring it in the restroom area.  Just the pillow won't yell in the theater.  It's always in my eyesight. 
[03:21:30]  Even if I can't touch it, it's around me.  She props it up while she's playing in the yard.  Whoever saw me with it, I wouldn't care.  I'm not ashamed.  Tamara bought her pillow at an antique shop in 1982.  She has never washed it.  It's got some ears on it, you know?  It's got some mouths on it.  Period blood.  But it's not dirty, and it's, well, it might be a little dirty, but it's not stinky.  I don't like when people say it's stinky.  I just get very disgusted by the pillow. 
[03:22:00]  It's just black and dark.  Like, why do you need to hang out with the pillow?  There's a part of me that is concerned about my older sister, addiction to her pillow.  I'd never be around anybody besides her to have their pillow.  I'd never be around anybody but her.  Do you feel like your addiction is something that you need to work on?  I'm okay.  And you don't think that can affect some of your relationship?  They must love the fact that she's with that white guy.  No, because I feel like if you want me, truly me, then you're going to accept my pillow. 
[03:22:30]  Because that is part of me.  Me and this pillow got history before you came.  Pillow's very important to her.  I can't say shit.  I can't watch this show.  She's eating drywall.  There's people that eat fucking...  Well, the couch is the best one.  Couch.  Fucking...  Like George the Animal Steel.  Yeah.  She's going through her couch the same way.  Foam rubber.  Foam rubber couch.  This one woman, it was like cornstarch or something.  She would just eat spoonfuls of it.  And you've got to wonder what their dumps are like. 
[03:23:00]  My name's Adele.  I'm 30 years old.  I'm a black chick.  I'm from Bradenton, Florida.  And my addiction is eating couch cushions.  Oh, my God.  See, it's the phone.  My earliest memory of eating cushion, I was about 10 years old.  And my cousin...  That's all we need to hear.  And my face was being pushed into the cushion so I could nauseam out so I could breathe. 
[03:23:30]  I guess we know it.  Yeah, what was happening there?  Sure.  Same as the pillow.  Sure.  A lot of sexual abuse.  Let's hope.  Speaking of which, Sam, a lot of people say we've got to do the beep game with the rock lady.  Really?  Because rock sounds like cat.  Right.  You've got the R.  Get the R out of there and she eats a lot of cat.  Well, you just leave the R in and it will sound like she's eating like Robert's soup or something.  Once you put the big rock in her mouth, that's going to sound great in the beep game. 
[03:24:00]  Sometimes I put the whole thing, get the earthy taste.  That's right.  So are we going to do that for tomorrow?  Yeah.  Oh, yes, we are.  Oh, yes.  Write it down.  I don't need to.  On Sam Asks for a Raise Wednesday.  Oh, yeah.  That's tomorrow already.  Tomorrow already.  Another week has gone by.  I haven't forgotten.  Thank God for that.  I got a new angle on that because I was scolded.  You were?  Oh, yeah.  Good.  We'll explain tomorrow.  I was scolded.  What a tease.  Who scolded you? 
[03:24:30]  Somebody said, I'm not going to tell you what to do, but.  Oh, brother.  So.  Oh, and by the way, I was driving home listening to the shit show.  After.  And, yeah.  And someone erroneously said that me and Opie had escaped into the elevator after.  Oh, yeah.  No.  You got caught yesterday?  I got fucking mad.  I think I got that information from Roland.  You did not escape.  Yeah, no, I didn't.  It's like, no, they both made it to the elevator. 
[03:25:00]  No.  I was right by the glass door to go to the elevators.  And it's like, Anthony.  Fuck.  I heard that Opie said, I'm just going to go to the bathroom.  And then took a step towards the bathroom.  Did the whole turnaround move.  Oh, nice.  And walked to the elevator.  And you got to make friends around here because there's a few more secret entrances.  And exits.  I have no idea.  I'm telling you.  There's one that is just amazing.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I got to figure that shit out.  But you got caught, Ant. 
[03:25:30]  Totally nailed.  I got to get more reliable witnesses.  Yeah, yeah.  Because I was listening and going like, what the fuck are they talking about?  My hand's up.  Yes, Opie?  Yes, sir.  Yes.  When is Gary back from vacation?  Oh, that's right.  He's back.  He was back yesterday.  He's here.  He came in before.  We should all...  Oh, you know what?  Gary was in studio today.  Gary came in and said, yeah, it was during the break.  He came in to check on everybody.  See how the show was going.  Yes, yes.  Was he here? 
[03:26:00]  Yeah, yeah.  He did hop in.  What the fuck was I doing?  I was wondering how the Dow was doing.  I think you were here.  Dow back up over 11,000.  Up 196 points.  I told you.  I said they would start up high, but it's not going to stay there.  Apple up $12.12.  Somebody's making some cash today.  That's pretty good.  Big fucking deal.  I don't know how much we paid for it.  Well, I'm sure you fucking made a couple of bucks. 
[03:26:30]  Punch out right now.  What's wrong?  You talked to Gary?  Yes, he...  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Did I see him?  I think you did.  No, I think you had your head down or something.  Were you looking at your iPad or something?  Yeah, you were probably doing something.  Someone sent me a video of MGMT getting pelted with shoes.  Maybe that's when Gary came in, because I watched the whole thing.  Rolling?  Rolling.  Do your guest pitches now.  I'm out of here today.  You're not going to stick around?  No.  Oh, fuck.  Yeah.  I'll jump on the grenade today. 
[03:27:00]  Go.  Just go.  All right.  Hold on.  Wow, that's a great plan.  Just go.  Just go.  And we'll just pretend...  Oh, we're just doing this for a bit.  It's just theater of the mind type of thing.  I'll jump on the grenade today.  Oh, wow.  Just go.  What are you pitching?  Just go.  Oh, shit.  Just go.  I got my shit.  We're still on the air.  If anyone's listening, we're still on the air.  Fine.  Don't worry about it.  You want Mick Foley next week?  Mick Foley?  Yeah, of course.  I like the Mick.  Mick's fun.  All right.  I'm fascinated with his cheapness.  What's he doing now?  He's like, not with TNA anymore? 
[03:27:30]  No, he's actually doing independent wrestling shows with me.  What?  I'm doing a show with him.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Oh, boy.  How is he fucking...  Come on.  Talk about him.  He's also...  He's doing an hour stand-up set.  I thought that jump he took off the top of the cage was a fall.  Oh, wow.  Where's he doing an hour stand-up?  I think one of the clubs in Long Island.  Maybe Governor's.  But...  Yeah.  This shows you how awful Vince McMahon is to allow Mick Foley to fall this far. 
[03:28:00]  Well, I mean, he's a lad, dude.  Terrible.  It's terrible.  He's a lad.  I mean...  I'm jumping on the ground.  Ah, Bill Tetley.  No, no, Jimmy.  Wait.  Um...  We're still in the air.  Yeah, I know.  I know.  We're just talking.  Ant is tying his shoelace in the studio.  Why is Roland following him down the hall?  This was supposed to be a clean getaway today.  I know, because he's making his guest pitches off the air.  Jimmy's going to be in Utah.  19th and 20th of August at the Wise Guys Comedy Club. 
[03:28:30]  A week from this weekend.  It is, yeah.  Um...  Friday and Saturday.  So a week from Friday.  And I'll be on Leno tomorrow night, right after the monologue.  I'm doing some new bit.  Very cool.  With a couple other guys.  So hopefully it'll go well.  I think it seems pretty funny.  All right.  There we go.  Roland.  What?  I got his Guy Fieri t-shirt on.  Roland, what do we got?  Oh, nothing.  I'm not talking to you after the show.  Uh-oh.  What do you got? 
[03:29:00]  Just the Jersey Shore people throughout the weeks.  Oh, yeah.  I heard they are coming up here.  Who?  I'd say at all.  I heard Snooki blows us off.  And Howard.  Well, we're not Howard.  Not her.  What?  Not her.  Just the other cast members.  Dean is coming up here, right?  I'll take any of them.  Wait.  Who's blowing us off?  Just Snooki.  That's the only one.  Why is that stupid fucking little thing blowing us off?  Because she's a twat.  Who the fuck does she think she is?  A twat.  She's going to be a nobody in a couple of years. 
[03:29:30]  She's not going to parlay this into a real career.  Fuck her.  I know.  She's the only one.  Why is she blowing us off?  She's a twat.  Did we take Dina?  We should take Dina.  Yeah.  Well, nine million people saw it.  I would take any of them.  I mean, I don't even watch the show.  Who are you being offered?  Probably Dina.  Vinny and Uncle Nino's going to give me dates soon.  Okay.  That's good.  And Sammy wants to come in also.  Sammy Sweetheart's?  Oh, my God. 
[03:30:00]  That'd be great.  I'll take her.  And then DJ Pauly.  He's opening up for Britney Spears.  Yeah.  DJ Pauly's all right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So he's opening for Britney Spears?  Yeah.  Wow.  That's huge.  Yeah.  I'll take any of them.  What does he do?  Fist pump for 20 minutes and then Britney Spears?  He's a DJ.  No, I know that's what Troy does.  Comes on and shows her twat.  What?  That's what Troy does now.  Troy?  Oh, my God.  It's going nowhere.  I feel like I'm in the 10 o'clock hour.  This bit is dying.  The 10 o'clock hour is a directional show.  And look, it is 10 o'clock. 
[03:30:30]  So, Jesus, you tricked me into the 10 o'clock hour.  By the way, we had Leah Thompson on the show yesterday.  Yeah.  Jimmy just got up.  He doesn't care.  Well, I was talking to you.  So that's okay.  All right.  We're going to end.  Fuck it.  So, we did go today.  Jimmy's going to go to L.A.  We'll see him Thursday, Utah, a week from Friday.  What else?  Ant didn't do this, so you got to.  Fuck.  You want to do it now?  And what is it?  Who is it for?  On-demand movie, NBC, NBCU, on-demand movies. 
[03:31:00]  All right.  You did it.  No, no, no.  You'd have to read from the top to bottom.  Let me see.  Now, so.  All right.  Bill Burr is calling in tomorrow for a special announcement.  Available now on demand of two adventure comedies you don't want to miss.  Get High and Mighty with Danny McBride.  Danny McBride said this movie wasn't that great.  No, he wrote the movie.  He said it was good.  Oh.  Maybe he was talking about another one.  Get High and Mighty with Danny McBride, James Franco, and Natalie Portman and Your Highness.  I kind of like this movie, actually. 
[03:31:30]  The epic and hilarious action comedy from the director of Pineapple Express.  Two royal princes, slacker weed-smoking Thaddeus and the noble Thaddeus, joined together  with an elusive warrior, played by Portman, on a quest to free a princess from an evil  wizard.  In this raunchy trip, critics hail as gloriously absurd, hilarious, and balls-out irreverent.  Make sure to catch the unrated version, Too Outrageous for Theaters, and also from the 
[03:32:00]  director of Superbad, It's Paul.  Now available on demand in a hilarious unrated version.  What was Paul about?  It was an alien movie with Simon Pegg.  Was it good?  People said wonderful things, and Jim and I met Sigourney Weaver while she was promoting  it.  She was in Paul?  Oh, yeah.  Jeffrey Tambor?  Yeah.  Seth Rogen was the voice of the alien?  That's right.  He wasn't there.  That was last year at Comic-Con.  Last year.  Supporting cast, Jason Bateman, Kristen Wiig, and Sigourney Weaver, like you said, this 
[03:32:30]  is a must-see comedy.  Must-see?  I gotta see it now.  You must.  Watch Your Highness and Paul, both available with unrated editions, not seen in theaters.  Available now on demand and digital.  What was that?  It's my computer.  Download.  It's down still on.  All right, Jimmy.  Have a safe trip.  Thank you, man.  If my plane doesn't crash and I'm not killed, I will see you guys.  If I'm killed, then this is my last appearance on the show.  I hope you're not.  Hold on.  I might be getting some intel.  Hello? 
[03:33:00]  Hey, it's Anthony.  Did you put me through?  It's me.  Okay.  How was that?  Was it clear sailing?  No, put me through.  It's me, you idiot.  Why'd you pick up?  Because I saw the hotline.  Hold on.  For a streamer.  Huh?  Yeah, they fucking nailed me.  How the fucking?  I totally got fucking nailed.  Oh, man.  You know what it is?  Yeah.  I look down the hallway, right?  Yeah.  Clear sailing.  And then, like, a trap door opens up. 
[03:33:30]  They come out those side hallways.  And just, like, step right in front of me.  And I was like, oh.  Then I'm being asked questions about a sponsor and about the roast thing.  And I'm just like, I don't.  That's their new obsession, is the roast thing, just because we casually mentioned it one day?  Yeah.  Jesus Christ.  And now we're, you know, they're at.  I was amazed.  I'm like, okay, smooth. 
[03:34:00]  And then, boom.  No.  You should have told a joke or something, like, yeah, I'm going to be roasting a bunch of, like, potatoes or something.  Yeah, that's, that's, I should use that next time.  What's, what, so what's the move today?  I have no idea.  I'm at a loss for getting out of there without getting into one of them.  They're, they're brilliant at one thing.  Us walking out those doors.  I don't know how to do it.  I know, I got a new way.  I know how to do it.  There's one exit. 
[03:34:30]  I got a new way to do it.  Yeah, maybe that's it.  I got a new way to do it.  Oh, yeah.  Why don't you announce, announce which way you're going, but then actually go the other way?  How about this?  Yeah.  If you don't see anyone, then they're not there.  So, should I just keep walking?  Yes.  Yes.  Just shut your eyes and walk past them.  If you don't see them, they're not there.  That's a new word, words of wisdom, words to live by. 
[03:35:00]  Where am I trying the new way?  New way?  What's this about a new way?  There's a new way out of here.  There's a secret door that, that I guess it's like in case of an emergency.  You would never know that it's an exit door, but I made some friends recently, and they  told me about it.  It looks like a very innocent door, but wow, it's like a James Bond door.  Tell them it is an emergency.  It says exit in case of boar.  Fuck, they got you, huh? 
[03:35:30]  Yeah.  I couldn't believe it.  I'm standing up.  I can't believe I'm talking.  Fuck.  Goddammit.  Where's Anthony?  All right.  Well, oh, what?  Are you gone?  Yeah, why?  Okay.  Wait, so, hold on a minute.  I want to ask you something.  Oh.  I'm not hanging up on you, I swear.  Oh.  You're going to be here for a little while?  Fast.  Yeah.  Yeah, he's just going to hang out.  All right, Chris. 
[03:36:00]  Is it considered the shit show now?  No, this isn't the shit show yet, because the sweeper hasn't hit, and the commercial hasn't  started.  Ant.  Yeah?  A lot of people want to know.  Mm-hmm.  Hold on a minute.  Yeah.  You're so inconspicuous.  A lot of people want to know.  I love that.  Hold on a minute.  Oh, fuck.  How am I going to do this?  Shit.  Um, hmm. 
[03:36:30]  Could someone, Roland, follow me downstairs with all this stuff.  Ant, I can't hear you.  I don't have my headphones on.  I've got to put my headphones back on so we can do a little more radio together.  I'm here.  I'm here.  This too.  A lot of people want to know.  Roland's helping out.  All right.  A lot of people want to know, now that the show is over, what does an Anthony Cumia do  when he's not on the radio?  And please make it a three-minute answer. 
[03:37:00]  Three-minute answer.  Okay.  I gotcha.  Um, well, the drive home takes up, uh...  You can stop whenever you want.  He's gone.  All right.  Well, he's got to actually get out the door.  Yeah.  Uh, Travis, can you see him from the window?  Yeah.  Is he going to get out?  He's walking out, uh, holding his video camera out recording.  I bet he gets nailed.  It looks good so far.  And Roland.  It always looks good. 
[03:37:30]  And then they jump out at it.  Here's the problem, is he's wasting time near our office.  And I think he might be strategizing that if he's recording on his video camera, nobody  will say anything that they want taped, and therefore they won't bother him.  He just turned towards the door, towards the elevator?  I've lost, uh, visual contact.  Maybe you're too nice, Ant.  I think, like, you know, you have a reputation of, you know, being a little more approachable,  and that's really starting to cost you.  It really is, because I just don't want to talk.  I do a radio show, and that's called talking. 
[03:38:00]  And then once I'm done, I just want to walk out to the car.  I mean, you started taking a few more shots at Gary, which I think is working in your favor,  but it seems like you've got a lot of legwork before you can really be, like, a real asshole  guy that is unapproachable.  Well, Gary isn't usually the one that comes up and talks to me.  Oh, boy.  Okay, so you've got a lot of work to do.  Yeah, yeah.  And they know, because I can look down that stretch of hallway and go, oh, he's down there. 
[03:38:30]  I'm going the other way.  Yeah.  But they wait until I'm halfway down the hallway, and then they come out, and then I can't  turn around and start running the other way.  I know what we're going to do.  It's like Pac-Man.  Body doubles.  Ah, we could do that.  If we have Travis shave his beard so he just has a mustache and put on a cap and put on,  like, an overshirt, from far away, he may, you know, he'll have a big backpack on.  He might kind of look like you enough that it would give you enough lead time that you 
[03:39:00]  could go the other way.  Hmm.  Maybe.  Well, anything's worth a try, because, man, I just can't take it anymore.  Well.  Give me an email.  Send an email.  Yeah.  Send an email.  Yeah.  That way I don't have to read that.  How hot is it out right now?  It's 81 degrees Fahrenheit.  It's not that hot.  It's hot.  You're on Lexington and 48th.  I tell you, on an August day, it could get worse.  I tell you. 
[03:39:30]  Oh, and if this savage thinks he's fucking getting past me, he's got another thing coming.  Oh.  Oh.  Yeah, this might be a race.  Travis just started playing air guitar and obviously humming.  You've got another thing coming to himself.  Okay, man.  The trick is to look at the crossing, the signals, and wait until they turn red, and then you just  go, come on, you fuck.  These old people in the crosswalks really have to die. 
[03:40:00]  Anyway, what's going on in there, too?  Well, I'm not quite sure what we're going to do.  We'll probably talk a little more to Troy about flipping out on call screeners, and I'll  play that clip again.  I know we actually got a couple of breaks to make up because you guys went so long in  the very beginning of the show, which, by the way, was a fabulous two-out.  He hung on.  He hung on.  Did you know that was coming?  No, I thought he was trying to have a conversation. 
[03:40:30]  Are you sticking around, or do you have to go?  I'm staying for a few minutes until I want to try to get a photo of someone before I leave  for the airport.  Oh.  My pickup here is 11.  Who's here?  A woman who may be coming in right before 11.  Oh, my gosh.  This is very exciting.  We'll get into all this and more, but we have to take a break.  But I wanted to go into some more detail.  You did on this woman whose name you won't mention.  We have to take a break to make up for lost time. 
[03:41:00]  We'll be right back with After Opie and Anthony Live.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony on the virus.  Sirius XM. </pre>
