<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a segment showcasing clips of various media personalities making controversial statements.  This included Jimmy "the Greek" Snyder's comments on Black athletes' perceived athletic superiority due to historical breeding practices during slavery, sparking a discussion on the context of his remarks and modern standards of acceptability.  The hosts also played clips of Howard Cosell, Wolf Blitzer, and several sports commentators making racially charged statements.  Colin Cosell, Howard Cosell's grandson, called in to defend his grandfather.  Celine Dion's nonsensical comments on Hurricane Katrina relief efforts, particularly her suggestion of using kayaks, provided comedic relief.  Clips featuring mispronounced words by news anchors, including Tom Brokaw's "tax cunts" instead of "tax cuts," were also played. Callers contributed anecdotes about Jesse Jackson being referred to as "Spear Chucker" and a sports reporter's comment about a running back "looking like he stole a watermelon."  The segment concluded with a discussion about politically incorrect statements and the freedoms afforded by satellite radio.

The show then transitioned to a humorous, yet offensive, bit about midgets/little people, followed by a discussion of road rage. Opie recounted being punched in the face, and Anthony described being punched twice by his girlfriend's estranged husband.  The conversation shifted to the popularity of puggle dogs, leading to a comedic and offensive discussion about the breed, unethical breeding practices, and the potential for abandonment once the fad passed.  A caller shared a story about a pit bull puppy falling from a high-rise building.  The segment concluded with a discussion of unsolved cruise ship disappearances, focusing on a recent case with a bloodstain, and speculation on the possible involvement of Russian individuals onboard.  Callers offered theories and the hosts speculated on the psychological factors involved in such disappearances.

The next segment delved deeper into the topic of cruise ship disappearances, with darkly humorous speculation about potential causes, ranging from accidental deaths to murder, including detailed (and absurd) descriptions of how one might commit murder on a cruise ship.  News reports about missing cruise passengers were played.  A former Coast Guard member called in, corroborating the challenges of sea searches.  The conversation then switched to Anthony's collection of German World War II memorabilia, sparking discussion about his fascination with the items' aesthetics, separate from their historical context.  Listener calls offered varying opinions, some expressing discomfort, others contributing to the dark humor. The discussion touched upon a film about people with mental disabilities performing "The Wizard of Oz," leading to further discussion about the appropriateness of making light of such topics.  A studio guest, Steve, participated in the banter.  Promotional material and advertisements were interspersed throughout this segment.

A segment featuring audio from a community theater rehearsal of *The Wizard of Oz* followed.  The hosts played clips of actors, many with apparent intellectual disabilities, struggling with their lines. Bill Burr was mentioned as being present in the studio.  Listeners called in with commentary and jokes, and the hosts frequently used derogatory terms like "retard."  Humorous moments arose from the actors' mistakes, and the segment included discussions about the actors' challenges and listener opinions.  Promotional announcements for other XM radio programming concluded this segment.


The final segment focused on frightening wildlife encounters. Opie shared a snorkeling experience fueled by fear of unseen creatures. A caller, Paul, discussed Alaskan wilderness encounters, emphasizing the need for a gun and a dog, even referring to the dog as a "meat shield."  Opie and Anthony recounted a frightening camping trip during a thunderstorm.  Several callers shared their own experiences with wildlife. The discussion repeatedly considered survival instincts overriding other considerations, including the hypothetical sacrifice of a pet or spouse to appease a predator. The recurring joke about "Ramon," a fictional character from show promos, was explained to a caller and used with an unsuspecting in-studio guest. The segment ended with more listener calls and a brief sports update covering the NHL and World Cup.

[00:00:00]  Thank you. 
[00:00:30]  Thank you. 
[00:01:00]  Thank you. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  Thank you. 
[00:04:00]  Thank you. 
[00:04:30]  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  Damn.  Hey, bud, what's your problem?  Where'd you get that, out of the hamper?  Hey, bud, let's party. 
[00:05:00]  You smoke crack, don't you?  You smoke crack, don't you?  Look at me, boy.  Don't you smoke crack.  Oh, I got one.  I got one.  I got one.  The black is a better athlete to begin with because he's been bred to be that way. 
[00:05:30]  Because of his high thighs and big thighs, it goes up into his back.  And they can jump higher.  And they can jump higher and they can jump higher and run faster because of their bigger thighs.  This goes back all the way to the Civil War, when during the slave trading, the big, the owner, the slave owner would breed his big black to his big woman so that he could have a big black kid.  We finally found the clip. 
[00:06:00]  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony program on XM Satellite Radio.  It's a virus.  You got to know that by now, the ONA virus.  Yes.  Slowly but surely spreading across America and now spreading across Canada.  You got to love that.  Well, that was great to hear the Jimmy the Greek clip again.  We've heard that in years.  We've been looking for this Jimmy the Greek clip for, yeah, a few years now.  Yeah.  What was it?  He was at some kind of function and he had a few drinks. 
[00:06:30]  Yeah, he was just sitting down at a table.  Dinner.  A dinner, yeah.  Having a few drinks.  Camera in his face.  Microphone.  And I don't know how that conversation got rolling.  I guess they were talking about probably some sports figure.  And he fell into that little train of thought.  Absolutely the truth, though.  Never understood why he got fired behind that shit.  Yeah, there are some truths that are unspoken.  You just can't say it.  It was just the truth. 
[00:07:00]  It was just like, you know, they bred big black niggas with big black nigglets to make big black babies.  They didn't want some skinny weakling guy.  That's what they did.  And is that why black is a better athlete?  Maybe white people was upset that they said black was a better athlete.  Yeah, maybe that was it.  Pissed the white man off.  Because the reason they are is exactly what that was.  Just what Jimmy the Greek said.  But back in the day, I don't think you could say that stuff.  Can't say it now.  I think he would have got away with it today.  No way.  Absolutely not. 
[00:07:30]  He would have got fucking not only fired, he would have kept getting rehired so that they could keep firing him.  Well, that's what I mean.  That would be the difference.  You're right.  He would do his time and then he'd be back on TV.  Just crucified.  It would be much worse.  That was back during fucking All in the Family when he said that shit.  That was back in the Howard Cosell days.  Look at that little monkey scamper.  I call a lot of people little monkeys.  That was his excuse. 
[00:08:00]  Look at that.  Can we find that clip too?  The Howard Cosell clip?  That's a great one.  And I'm not sure that was racist.  Sometimes I really want to say everything white people do is racist just to say it.  Right.  But, you know, context is something.  People who don't understand context, I tend to believe women just don't understand context.  It's just the word is the word and like, oh.  Doesn't matter where it is or what it's being used for.  Right.  Just, but look at that little monkey.  It just was something that popped in his dummy.  I'm sure he's late in races, but he was an old Jew. 
[00:08:30]  How racist could he be?  But I'm sure he didn't.  He was probably pissed because it's like, my God, I wasn't trying to be racist.  If I was trying, you'd have known it.  You know?  Look at that little cooner right.  Yeah, exactly.  And it pisses you off when you get accused of doing something that you didn't, that you do.  You've done it before.  You do it.  You get accused of it when you weren't doing it.  It's like, wait a minute.  No, no. 
[00:09:00]  Let me give you an example of when I did do that.  He's running like he thinks he's free from slavery.  Look at him running.  Look at that ashy negro running his little black cheeks off.  He's running like the chains just came off him.  Look at him go.  So you just want to be, I don't think that Jimmy is that stupid.  He wanted to have a job.  He was just trying to be candid and a little, it's like, hey, it is what it is. 
[00:09:30]  This is why.  I think it's just the whole equating the black man to an animal type thing.  Because if you had the same conversation about thoroughbred racehorses, if you got this little weakling thoroughbred horse that came out, you're not going to use it to breed with another thoroughbred to make the strongest racehorse you can.  And with the Civil War, the guy's talking about Civil War days, not fucking what's going on, you know, at the time he said this.  And he said that the plantation owners wanted strong workers. 
[00:10:00]  So why would they breed, when they had power to do this, some weak black guy with a black woman?  It's just what they did.  It's just what they did.  But you can't say it.  You can't say it.  Did they really just pick two big mothers out and said go fuck?  Well, it's a whole plan.  If you one day, while you're taking breaks off of being racist, just look at the, what they call the Willie Lynch papers.  Willie Lynch?  The Willie Lynch theory, it's supposedly, quote unquote, urban legend, but it's not urban legend. 
[00:10:30]  It was the plan on how to design slavery because to how to keep black people enslaving themselves is the plan.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  And it's based on how horse breeding.  Really?  It's based on horse breeding.  It's strange I brought that up.  It is.  All right, listen.  That is strange.  I've never heard of that, yet I used the horse analogy.  Look at, Opie's like, Opie's just like Jimmy the Green.  No, no, no, no.  Listen, everybody.  Not at all.  I'm going to bring this to the next level. 
[00:11:00]  Oh, you're going to bring the people in.  I'm bringing it.  The trucker in Nebraska.  Fuck no.  You're a fucking nigga.  It wasn't based on horses.  Stupid.  It was based on ducks and dogs.  You have to have faith in me sometimes, Patrice.  All right, Opie.  Watch what I do right now.  Oh, Jesus.  We got Howard Cassell's son, nephew.  Somebody related to Howard Cassell.  Wait, I always forget.  Grandson.  That's right.  We have Howard Cassell's grandson.  He calls the show every once in a while.  Really?  For real.  I swear to God, this is Colin Cassell. 
[00:11:30]  What's up?  Colin, you know we have the utmost respect for your grandfather.  It's funny.  The one morning I just happened to be listening, Barry, I'm all excited for the show to start,  and you start off with bashing my grandfather in the race.  No!  We didn't say he was.  We actually said that was taken out of context.  We was giving it to him.  Can you imagine, though?  Hold on, Colin.  What a coincidence this is.  Just out of nowhere, we finally find the Jimmy Degree clip.  We decide to play it at the start of the show, and Howard, they go into the Howard Cassell 
[00:12:00]  thing, and Howard's grandson is listening.  Colin, first of all, you've got to start with your impression.  Listen to his impression of his grandfather.  Never has there been a bigger abomination than calling my grandfather the late Howard  Cassell a racist.  Pretty goddamn good, man.  No, I've got to tell you this story real quick, though.  The guy that he was referring to as a little monkey, and yes, he did call all his grandchildren 
[00:12:30]  little monkeys when we were running around, but the guy's name was Alvin Garrett.  And after the game, someone was interviewing him and said, you know, what do you think of  these comments that Howard said about you?  He said, I'm just glad Howard Cassell knows my name.  Yeah, because it was taken out of context.  I just refused.  I loved accusing people of being racist, but it just wasn't.  It was a fun thing.  Have you ever seen a little monkey run?  They are quick motherfuckers.  Look at that little monkey scamper.  If you want to talk about someone running fast, regardless of their color, a little monkey 
[00:13:00]  is a good...  They're using four legs, though.  They're not...  The barometer would be if he was still alive today and saw King Kong, and he goes, look  at Lawrence Taylor climb that building.  LT's really making some headway.  He's already up to the 45th floor.  Now, Howard Ali finally has a challenger.  There he is, once known as the great Cassius Clay, working his way up to floor 52. 
[00:13:30]  White woman in hand, this should outrage the American public.  Now, James, the bi-wing plane.  Oh, my God.  This is awful.  Ali with a right hook to a wing.  The plane is down.  The plane is down.  Oh, look at that little Ali scamper.  The casting crew of Tequila Mockingbird still outraged by the blonde woman in his hand. 
[00:14:00]  He was completely vindicated for that, you know?  Well, I mean, you know, he had, after all those years of supporting Jackie Robinson and  Muhammad Ali, and then you have one little slip-up one night, and everyone's like, he's a racist!  Yeah.  But that's the media for him.  So, uh, for you.  So, fuck him.  That's what I was saying.  Yeah.  Down with the media.  Oh, Colin.  Very good.  Great job.  Thanks for letting me go, uh, get on and defend my grandfather. 
[00:14:30]  No problem.  Any time there, Colin.  Where's the wig again?  Uh, we still don't know.  Someone has the wig.  I see someone's got the wig.  I do this every time I call, and I still don't know.  I've checked eBay.  I have no idea.  We're trying to find the wig.  Like, turns up on eBay.  Imagine what Howard Cosell's wig would go for.  Uh, 50,000.  60,000, probably.  Probably.  At least.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Probably less than his jacket.  I'm sure, like, his ABC Monday Night Football jacket would be.  I've got his entire wardrobe in my closet, actually.  Really?  Yep.  Wow.  You got the, uh, uh, ABC Sports jacket?  I do. 
[00:15:00]  Holy shit.  Bring it in.  That's a biggie.  Actually, well, I was going to come in.  I was, uh, waiting until, uh, Jimmy was back because I, you know, sort of know him because  we did a little bit of comedy together, but I was going to bring in some of my grandfather's  original ties for each of you.  Dude, what is, is the jacket in good condition, like, or is it?  Would, would you be able to bring that in?  Because I would love to put it on and take a photo in it.  I, I could if, uh, if I'm allowed to shake your hand.  Yeah, Anthony.  You can absolutely shake my hand.  Anthony is strange that way. 
[00:15:30]  He's got a picture of him in the, uh, Johnny Bravo jacket as well.  The Johnny Bravo, uh, jacket from, uh, the Brady Bunch.  That's right.  Which was a thrill for me.  And Howard Cosell's jacket would be, uh, fantastic.  Excellent.  Well, I'll do what I can.  Colin, come in next week.  Jimmy's back next week.  I will do that.  All right.  Just come in any day.  You don't even have to set up an appointment.  Yeah.  Just show up.  That'll make my friend Frank Mastro very happy.  He's like, when are you going to finally go in there?  I said, I don't know.  I'm waiting for Jimmy.  So next week, I'll do it.  All right.  Leave us with some Howard.  All right.  Gentlemen, I wish you the greatest show that you could possibly have. 
[00:16:00]  Bring them the funny and take down that big bird-looking son of a bitch, Howard Stern.  All right.  Thank you, Colin.  All right, gentlemen.  Cool.  Colin Cosell, everyone.  We have another Jimmy the Greek, uh, clip here.  If they take over coaching like everybody wants them to, there's not going to be anything  left for the white people.  I mean, all the players are black.  I mean, the only thing that the whites control is the coaching jobs.  Now, I'm not being derogatory about it, but that's all that's left for them.  Oh, what a poor, just a poor, honest old idiot. 
[00:16:30]  That's what he is.  Just a dopey ass, honest motherfucker sitting there.  Just an honest old idiot, man.  Like, hey, you got to leave the coaching for some of the white guys.  That's not what we're going to do if all the niggas are goddamn coaching now, too?  Look at that little monkey calling the plays.  Look at that little monkey negotiating.  Holy shit, he negotiated a contract. 
[00:17:00]  Goddamn.  Holy shit, man.  That poor, honest old bastard, man.  And he was on everything back in the day, like all those variety shows, Bob Hope.  You know, he would turn up constantly.  Whenever there was a Kentucky Derby, they would always, he was the first guy they would go to.  Jimmy the Greek, your picks for this?  Well, I don't know.  I'm looking at this horse, and if it was a colored guy, I'd have to lay my money on it. 
[00:17:30]  The guy just didn't know when to cut it off and just shut the fuck up.  Let's go to Neil in Wisconsin.  Neil, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Max McGee, the announcer for the Packers about, I don't know, 10, 12 years ago,  Herschel Walker was carrying the ball, and he was running down the sidelines.  He says he looks like he just stole a watermelon headed south.  He got into trouble for that one.  Oh, my God.  If you guys have this stuff, you got to send it into the show. 
[00:18:00]  Oh, my God.  I had it, but take it easy, guys.  All right, thank you, Neil.  Mistaken racist comments.  Yeah.  And you just don't, I don't want to give white people credit enough for being that knowledgeable about how to be racist.  He's like, he doesn't want to lose his job.  No.  Right?  So it's just, it's just, he's a country boy.  He's kind of goofy.  Yeah.  And that, he's describing what it is, and it's like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  You can't say boy.  You can't say monkey. 
[00:18:30]  You can't say watermelon.  And you, you, you want to just turn around and say, fucking racist, but you'd give it a little too much thought and you're like, guy's just stupid.  He's just stupid.  He's really not a racist.  He's just stupid.  Like, Cosell's whole personality just doesn't lend itself to, to being a racist.  Right.  It just lends itself to being, like, if you had a guy who was announced and he just goes, oh, boy, look at this fucking nigga running.  Yeah, there you go.  Oh, boy.  Could be a problem.  Look at, look at this fucking hole in the water, hole in the ball like it's a goddamn watermelon. 
[00:19:00]  Well, yeah, another touchdown by a nigga.  Well, yeah, surprise, surprise, another nigga scored a touchdown.  If it was like that, it'd be different, but it's like, look at this little, holy mogolis.  You know, like an Italian player, he goes, holy cannoli.  Holy cannoli.  Oh, why gotta be a cannoli up in this motherfucker?  Let's go to Steve in New York.  Steve, what do you have?  What about Wolf Blitzer on CNN with the Katrina thing?  They're so poor and so black. 
[00:19:30]  They are so poor.  They are so black.  When he said that.  Yeah, we got the Wolf Blitzer, too?  Oh, where's the Wolf Blitzer?  Huh?  He didn't get in trouble for that?  He didn't get in trouble.  No, because they were so poor and so black.  I mean, they really ain't.  Yeah, we got all this.  We got a lot of this stuff.  We got to start playing it now.  Oh, my God.  Eric's trying to find that for us.  Yeah, Wolf Blitzer during Katrina.  He's talking with one of the reporters.  And, of course, he's back in CNN Central there. 
[00:20:00]  The Situation Room.  He's got all those cameras, all those video screens behind him.  And he's trying to be a little profound, I guess.  And he goes, and these people, you watch the heartbreaking video of them being evacuated from the rooftops.  And no food or water.  And they are so poor.  And they are so black.  Wow.  If you didn't see him trying to muster up that emotion. 
[00:20:30]  Like, if he just goes on and just struggling and just, ah, what difference does it make?  Yeah, who cares?  When you look at it, all you see are a sea of black faces.  Wet niggas.  What are you going to do?  We have another one.  Turtlehead.  Hey, good morning, fellas.  Good morning.  Hey, don't forget.  I don't know if Patrice ever heard it.  Martin Luther Koundé.  Oh.  What?  That was a weather guy.  Yeah, do we have that one too?  He got fired, man.  Oh, my God.  He got fired before they went to sports right after the weather. 
[00:21:00]  That is fraudying up the ass hole.  Because he was saying Martin Luther King Day, and he said Martin, like he slipped up before  he even got to King.  So King came out like Kuhn, and it didn't even all the way come out.  It was like Martin Luther King, like, oh, no.  Oh, no.  So he was going to say cold front, or I don't know. 
[00:21:30]  He got all.  He was thinking.  He got all messed up.  Yeah, it seemed like it.  But Freudian, yeah.  It didn't seem like he.  With his buddies, he could say that all the time, and then it came out when he.  Yeah.  Here's what I decree.  Here's the decree we make right now.  Mm-hmm.  Before, when any white guy does something like that, the black community gets the vote on  whether he gets fired or not.  Yeah, but that's an instant fired.  It's not.  Because.  If the black community gets the vote?  You know what black people didn't give a shit about was Rush Limbaugh, saying that. 
[00:22:00]  Remember he was talking about the quarterback for Philly?  Oh, right.  McNabb.  And he goes, they want to, you know, he's a black quarterback.  He stinks.  He goes, he sucks, but they're pumping him up because you need a black quarterback to  be good.  He got some heat for that, though.  He got fired for that.  For ESPN.  He got fired.  Oh, from ESPN, yeah.  But I'm not positively sure that he's not, that it was, Rush Limbaugh himself is, you  know, what he is.  But it's like, I don't know if that's a racist comment to go, you know, I'm not sure if the 
[00:22:30]  NFL doesn't need black quarterbacks.  They might need them because it was a stigma all that time.  So it's like, I'm not sure Rush should be, I'm not sure.  In that situation, though, unless you have the piece of paper from the NFL higher ups  that said, we really need a lot more black quarterbacks.  So you could show it and go, see, I was just saying that if you're speculating like he  was like that, then it can be construed as being racism and out you go. 
[00:23:00]  We got the Wolf Blitzer clip.  Ah, here's Wolf.  As much as you see that picture, though, you simply get chills every time you see these  poor individuals.  As Jack Cafferty just pointed out, so tragically, so many of these people, almost all of them  that we see are so poor and they are so black.  And this is going to raise lots of questions for people who are watching this story unfold.  We'll take a quick break.  More of our special coverage.  Yeah, we'll take a quick break. 
[00:23:30]  I absolutely know where he was going with that.  He just fucked up.  He I really think he meant to say they're so poor and so many of them are black.  Right.  Like, that's what he meant.  It's not like they're so black, like, look at that motherfucker.  You can't see it.  It's fucking dusk.  And already I can't see the motherfucker.  You know, how many homicidal dopes did you think you all threw out the producers and  all the so poor and so black, so black. 
[00:24:00]  Don't, holy shit.  Oh, damn.  Well, let's go to commercials.  We'll be right back after this break.  Well, what do you say about the rednecks, like, and the tornado?  It's like there's no, see, that's the thing that keeps us apart is that you give white  people so much credit for being able to, like, affect your life with their little statements.  But it's like, you know, oh, look at the poor white people in tornado.  And, oh, look at them there.  They're just so, they shouldn't be in this position because they're white.  Because they're white. 
[00:24:30]  There should be black folks blowing away.  Oh, God.  I don't like, you know, when you see large groups of white people carrying babies and  food over their back and stuff, you're like, why are they in that position?  Why the fuck?  But then Katrina, you see just, like, huge groups of black people walking around with  babies and groceries and everything, whatever they can carry.  And you're like, oh, well, you know, the poor down there, they should have known to fucking  leave and the water came in. 
[00:25:00]  That's why they're trapped on the rooftop.  They don't fucking listen to the goddamn news.  What the fuck?  They listen to their hip-hop music.  Maybe if they turn the hip-hop off every once in a while and put on a fucking news station,  they'd have known this shit was coming.  Turn on BET, put on a little CNN.  I'm sure BET didn't have the fucking map with the hurricane going, it's coming your  way, motherfucker.  They thought it was a new video.  Katrina hits.  Oh, shit, Katrina hitting. 
[00:25:30]  Katrina dropping.  Where's Katrina dropping?  Is she opening up for Beyonce?  Oh, man.  Let's go to Georgia.  Eric, what's up?  Hey, you guys.  The sports stuff is hilarious, but about two years ago, this running back from, I think  it was either Virginia or Virginia Tech, he made some, like, ridiculous 95-yard run or  something.  And after the game, one of the sports reporters was asking him, you know, what was he thinking  about when he was doing the run?  And he was like, to be honest with you, I just pretended I was being chased by the cops. 
[00:26:00]  That's funny.  And he was a black kid, and it was just like, the reporter sat there, like, he, uh, uh, uh,  there's nothing better than watching the reporters in an uncomfortable situation like that.  Because I've seen anchor people where somebody, maybe the sports guy, because it's always the  sports guy or the weather guy, just say something fucking stupid.  Like, the anchors usually have it together enough to know that their career, like, they can fuck it 
[00:26:30]  up by, by saying something stupid.  Sports and weather guys, they want to get their little moment in there, so sometimes they really  fuck up and say something not even overtly racist, but just enough to make the anchors so  uncomfortable that they won't even comment on it or acknowledge he said it or anything.  So later on in the management meeting, they could go, well, look at the tape.  I didn't even hear it.  I'm just shuffling my paper.  We'll be back with our top stories after we get this idiot away from my desk. 
[00:27:00]  I love it.  All right, we can't find Martin Luther Kuhn.  What about, uh, Joe, uh, line one from Denver?  I remember this one.  All right, let's go to Denver.  Joe?  Hey, what about when Tiger Woods won the, uh, his first championship?  Oh, yeah.  Fuzzy Zeller.  Yeah, you get to pick the menu for the next year, and Fuzzy says, well, I guess next year  we're having fried chicken and watermelon.  Oh, God.  But see, black people, this is, this is a war between white people. 
[00:27:30]  Black people really think some of that shit is hilarious.  It's just that we gotta, we gotta keep you motherfuckers in check when you just say goofy  shit like that.  Right.  But it's hilarious.  We would say that to each other.  Right, right, right.  We've trashed Tiger Woods.  Black people trashed Tiger Woods ever since he goes, I'm Carblazean.  And it's just like, motherfucker, you a nigger.  You gooky nigger.  You ain't no Carblazean Asian motherfucker.  Carblazean.  What the hell is that?  I'm Carblazean. 
[00:28:00]  I'm half the, shut the fuck up.  Goddamn Porsche bucket.  You a nigger.  And that's how you're gonna get treated.  Didn't Fuzzy Wuzzy let you know that?  Fuzzy let you know that.  And Fuzzy's defense was, no, we say this shit all the time.  All the time.  And they do.  In the locker room.  You know they fuck with that half a black Asian motherfucker.  You know they mess with Tiger's head like that.  And you know something?  He gets them back tenfold by kicking their fucking asses out there on the court.  If you guys got some of these clips, send them into the show. 
[00:28:30]  Because we don't have all of them, unfortunately.  Yeah, we gotta scrape these up.  We did find tax cunts, by the way.  Oh, we did?  Yeah.  I mean, it's sort of in the same category.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  News people fucking up.  Miss speaking.  That was Tom Brokaw doing some kind of special.  He was standing on a runway right next to an airplane or some shit.  This is one of our favorites of all time.  And he was meant to say the presidential tax cuts.  And he's got such a bad speech impediment.  This guy, obviously, everyone knows he's just retired recently. 
[00:29:00]  But had a long, illustrious career as an anchorman for NBC Nightly News.  Could not speak.  He had one of those lisps where you can't say your L words.  It comes out like just this compression between the back of the tongue and the upper of your mouth.  So you sit there, NBC Nightly News.  I'm Tom Brokaw.  Today's top story.  Leon Klinghoffer pushed off the deck of the Achilles.  I couldn't say it.  I saw that clip years ago of him saying that and was like, this motherfucker can't talk. 
[00:29:30]  He's the top dog at the news organization.  And he can't say an L.  And here he is screwing up tax cuts.  Listen to the little gap right after he said it when he knew he fucked up.  But if the gap was any longer, he knew people would know he fucked up.  So he trudges on like a pro.  The key component and what the president insists is a job stimulus program.  Ohio, a strong Republican state, is hurting economically.  And as NBC David Gregory reports tonight, the president took his message right to a powerful Ohio Republican who is not convinced the tax cunts are the answer. 
[00:30:00]  The tax cunts.  That long space sounded like 20 years, didn't it?  Oh, yeah.  Tax cunts.  And to watch the video, it's a flash that comes over his face.  It doesn't last more than a quarter of a second.  But you see it.  He panics.  His eyes get a little wider. 
[00:30:30]  That delay.  And then goes right back into it.  He proed his way through it.  Like, oh.  Because it was live, you know.  It was fucking live, man.  I think the best way to do it is to just pretend you did not know.  If you say, like, so poor, so black.  You just.  But see.  Wolf did a good job.  That's what Wolf Blitzer did.  That's that thing where emotions for an emotionalist kind of person comes in and he's feeling emotional.  And it fucks up his entire rhythm.  Because usually he's just disconnected.  So poor.  And so many people are black. 
[00:31:00]  And it's, you know.  I know this is just a tragedy.  But it's just so poor.  So black.  So black.  I so fucked that line up.  So wet and so crispy.  So nappy-headed.  Like, just fucking.  No one.  Nothing beats the kayaks, though.  With Celine Dion.  Oh, Celine.  Just losing her mind.  Did you hear the kayak one?  No.  This is.  We got shit to play for you.  When the victims of Katrina are on TV. 
[00:31:30]  And it was 24 hours a day.  I mean, everyone watched it.  And all the celebrities had to get involved.  Sean Penn down in the boat with his shotgun and helping people get out.  And Celine Dion on Larry King starts talking.  Gets very emotional about this whole thing.  And just babbles like an idiot.  Like the idiot she is.  She is mentally retarded with a Vegas show.  That's what it is.  A retard with a Vegas show. 
[00:32:00]  Yeah.  Before the kayak one, listen to this.  You know, some people are stealing and they're making a big deal out of it.  Oh, they're stealing 20 pairs of jeans.  Or they're stealing television sets.  Who cares?  They're not going to go too far with it.  Maybe those people are so poor.  Some of the people who do that, they're so poor.  They've never touched anything in their lives.  Let them touch those things for once.  All right.  Only a fucking mongoloid retard would even have a thought process like that. 
[00:32:30]  That they're not stealing.  Oh, you can touch this plasma TV, but you can't have it.  That's because she doesn't have a history of having an emotion.  Right.  The emotional thing to say is, man, who gives a fuck about those televisions?  Yeah.  And just who cares?  And end it, but she's trying to be so profound in her new emotion that she's discovered.  Need to touch it.  Need to touch it.  No.  Look, Celine, let me clue you in.  They don't just want to touch it. 
[00:33:00]  They want to take it as many as they can, keep them bone fucking dry, so when this shit clears up,  they can sell it and make a lot of fucking money.  It has nothing to do.  There isn't a tear in the gentleman's eye as he's like, I never thought I'd touch this.  Look at this.  Panasonic.  Panasonic.  Not only am I going to touch it, I'm going to take 20 pairs for myself.  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:33:30]  Cleon, there's no electricity.  I just want to touch it, man.  I just want to touch the fucking thing.  I just want to touch it.  You know something?  You can touch it.  I never.  Her emotions, she just discovered something she just didn't know, and she couldn't control it.  It's like a science fiction movie where an emotionless robot finally gets the chip that gives him emotion.  That's what she was like.  She didn't know how to handle it.  What is this thing leaking from my eye? 
[00:34:00]  It's a tear.  Oh, my God, tear.  Feelings.  I am disturbed by these feelings.  I cannot deal with this.  What?  I feel a pain that is not truly a pain in my midsection.  Feelings.  Nothing more than feelings.  Trying to forget my feelings of love.  Just let them touch it.  Just let them touch it.  I'm sure that's all they want. 
[00:34:30]  Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, why I'm crying.  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  That's what she is.  You're right.  She just got hit with an emotion.  It was self-importance.  Yeah.  It had nothing to do with Katrina.  It was just her jerking herself off because she was feeling that way every time.  I'm going to tell you the one true emotion out of the whole thing is that goddamn Kanye West is just...  Oh, right, right.  But see, Michael Myers in that clip, I don't know if you ever saw that thing, and I know you guys had to talk about it many times. 
[00:35:00]  Hell yeah.  But it's just like you can just...  That is the pain of being phony in Hollywood.  It's just you can't deal with that.  If Michael Myers called himself a comic when fucking Kanye said, and George Bush don't care about black people, I'd have started...  I would have laughed so hard at him trying to collect this emotion and saying that crazy shit, and then watching Mike Myers try to disconnect. 
[00:35:30]  It's like, motherfucker, you're a comic, too.  Just start laughing.  Just start laughing at that shit.  Imagine if he turned to him and looked at him, like, and put his eyebrows up and just went...  Did you just say...  These people are struggling to be honest, man.  That's the fuck the thing about this business.  That's what's good about the radio.  It's like, you could just yap about some shit, be honest, and it doesn't hurt.  You know, you say some shit, you might say a little tsunami shit wrong here. 
[00:36:00]  What are you going to do?  What are you going to do?  But you could be honest, but there is no honesty left.  The honesty, whatever little piece of honesty anyone really wants to come out with in Hollywood,  in that whole circle, has to be covered up in this armor, you know, that, like, then it's not even honesty anymore.  But what's the drive for that?  What is the root of dishonesty in terms of why can't people just say what they want?  Who's in charge of this new phenomenon when you can't say shit?  There are so many little interest groups now that have such a loud voice. 
[00:36:30]  Like, you don't need the NAACP coming after you anymore.  You need, like, the fucking 125th Street fucking committee that thinks you're a fucking asshole.  You don't need the whole...  You don't need the whole shebang anymore.  It's anything you say now.  There is a group.  You could talk about fucking anything,  and there will be a group that will write a letter and be offended.  And everyone, especially in Hollywood, that has careers and sponsorships, 
[00:37:00]  and the more corporations that get involved with stuff,  the more they don't want to offend anybody.  Now, how much money would you need to have in your pockets, right,  before offending anybody didn't mean shit to you?  Where you felt comfortable enough to say,  God, fuck, yeah, I got this many millions.  You know what?  Blow me.  We almost have enough.  It would be a lot.  That's the beauty of Satellite Radio.  We don't have to really worry about sponsors yet.  It's not so much money, though.  It's like boredom. 
[00:37:30]  What am I going to do?  Yeah, we want to do this.  What am I going to do?  I kind of enjoyed this job.  Let's get back on track.  We got the Celine Dion.  Take it from me.  We got the kayak clip here.  Let's listen in on this.  Oh, the kayak.  Patrice has never heard this.  Listen to this genius.  It is...  You know, when I was hearing a couple of days ago  that these things are not reachable,  it's too full of water,  maybe I'm too much like a mile.  I'm not thinking with my head.  I'm talking with my heart.  Nobody can open any roofs.  The helicopter's flying in. 
[00:38:00]  Take two people at a time.  Take a kayak.  Go into those walls.  There's kids being raped at night.  We hear gunshots.  Big guns.  What's that?  Those people are praying.  They're walking.  They're like this.  Hello?  Do you see us?  We're dying.  Celine, honey.  I do not want to talk to you about money.  Celine, segue. 
[00:38:30]  And people are dying.  And cheese.  But things are floating away.  How come gum?  What?  Die.  Why?  They punch my teeth.  They hit me and punch me.  My gums, they're bleeding.  She sounded like, come on.  What is it?  It's a jerky.  I drive cab, but my teeth, they're killing me.  Is this dental malpractice? 
[00:39:00]  Take the kayak.  Get through those walls.  What walls?  The walls?  Smash the walls with the kayak?  Children are being raped in the big guns and the...  Why?  And this is the fucking...  The guy sitting there listening to that shit said, uh, Celine, the walls?  The walls?  What is it?  Smash the kayak against...  Against the wall?  What?  Get the kayak.  What are you going to do with a fucking kayak, first of all? 
[00:39:30]  And then have the people do the kayak, uh, row?  Yeah.  They're going to be rowing with the single oar.  No, no, no.  You have to...  You have to kneel in the kayak.  Yeah.  So that you can do the kayak row.  You can't sit in the kayak...  They don't know how to sit in kayaks.  Kayak.  Get the kayak.  Why would they take a kayak?  You can't carry a fucking, like, a butter knife in a kayak.  Never mind a saw to get through a roof or a wall.  Take the jackhammers and heavy equipment. 
[00:40:00]  Put them on a kayak.  Why?  If you're going to fantasize about what she wants to happen, how about you get a big boat in there and some fucking big helicopters?  Take two people at a time.  I think they were taking more than two at a time in the helicopter.  That is the most uninformed jackass I've ever heard talk about that.  It was just so...  Her emotions were so new to the poor thing.  Oh, that's hilarious.  Hilarious.  The Titanic is sinking.  You know, get... 
[00:40:30]  People, get a log raft out there to help them.  You know?  Why?  And the ice peak and furfings.  Ices.  People are freezing in the waters.  Why can't we drop some warm socks for them?  No, you don't understand.  It's like they're in the North Atlantic.  It's freezing.  The ship went down.  I know we have to help them get some hand warmers, some gloves for when they are waiting.  Take gas boilers.  They could do that.  Gas boilers.  Get some hair blowers and some generators so they can use that to dry their wet heads so they don't catch cold in the icy North Atlantic. 
[00:41:00]  Why?  Why?  Oh, she...  Poor thing.  You gotta feel bad when she just...  She meant well.  Brand new to emotions.  Get the ice chippers.  Everyone on the front of the boat could chip the iceberg.  What an underestimating idiot this woman is.  Take a kayak.  The walls. 
[00:41:30]  But she wasn't saying what to do or anything.  She was just naming stuff.  Just blurting shit out.  Kayak.  Walls.  Walls.  Onions.  Bitch, is this a recipe?  You cook the soup?  Take the soup.  Now mix in some parsley.  The people hungry looked at walking.  Hello.  The word is kayak.  Kayak.  It's like bass or...  Kayak.  Onion.  Boat.  Helicopter.  Or... 
[00:42:00]  Walls.  Wood.  Onions.  Kayak.  Wood.  Kayak.  Onion.  Wait a minute, wait a minute.  Kayak, wood, onion.  Celine, the password is kayak.  Okay, I'd like to play.  Small.  Boat.  I help people.  Walls.  Tool.  Alternating rowing.  Helicopters.  Rapids. 
[00:42:30]  And black people.  Huh?  Hello.  Black people.  Onions.  Plasma TVs.  Touch them.  Touch TV.  Oh, what a dope.  What an ass.  All right, now we've got to back up a little bit.  We found the Martin Luther Coon Day thing.  Oh, God damn it.  This all started with one stupid clip this morning.  Yeah.  We were sitting around going, how are we going to start the show today? 
[00:43:00]  And this is how it starts.  It amazes me every day we pull this off.  The next couple of days, temperature is going to stay well above normal after a couple of  days well below normal.  Here's a look at your extended forecast for tomorrow.  Sunshine, 60 degrees, Martin Luther King Jr. Day.  We're going to see temperatures in the low 60s and mostly sunny skies.  Look at that as we head toward Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday.  You're fired.  And that guy's body temperature is about 120 right now. 
[00:43:30]  Oh, my God.  I just went.  Oh, they gave him the Oscar too long speech music.  Here's what I think happened.  If you would play it again, you could hear this.  And this is, maybe I'm wrong, but I'm giving the guy the benefit of the doubt.  Why would you, first of all, why the fuck would you go on the news and say that?  On purpose.  You wouldn't.  Just wouldn't.  You wouldn't.  He's saying Martin Luther King Jr.  The ooh in Jr. and the K in King.  Martin Luther. 
[00:44:00]  Did you ever mix shit up?  So he mixed King and Jr. and got Kuhn.  Martin Luther, Kuhn, yeah.  He would have gotten Martin Luther, Kuhn, King-er.  But say Kuhn and King.  King starts out completely different.  Yeah, but if he had Jr.  You ever get ahead of yourself in your head as you're speaking?  So he, as he says the K for King, he's already got the ooh for Jr.  So it's Kuhn-er.  But he never, he corrected himself too soon, I think. 
[00:44:30]  It's a wonderful day here on George Washington Lincoln.  What?  Washington Lincoln Day?  George Wooden Toof.  Wooden Toof.  I mean George Washington.  Let's listen again here.  The next couple of days, temperature is going to stay well above normal after a couple of days well below normal.  Here's a look at your extended forecast for tomorrow.  Sunshine, 60 degrees, Martin Luther King Jr. Day.  We're going to see temperatures in the low 60s and mostly sunny skies.  Look at that as we head toward Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday. 
[00:45:00]  The sweat just immediately was on his forehead.  And I got a warm front going across my forehead right now.  You know all that mud makeup that they put on your face?  Yeah.  Do you think it just started dripping down like a landslide over his eyebrows?  Yeah, his head.  He's like, he's like, oh, I'm really fucked.  I'm fired.  I'm fucked deeper than a doppel of two million.  I'm doppel of three million, fuck, baby, on this one.  And we'll have the rest of the forecast tomorrow.  Honey, if you can hear me, get my resume to Kinko's.  Please, immediately, I'm fired. 
[00:45:30]  But did he say the N in Kuhn?  No, it was like, cool.  What?  He could have said cool.  I thought I was going to mix cool and Martin Luther King.  Cool Jr.  Maybe he was trying to fit the word cool in there.  That was a slip up.  He couldn't get out of that.  He couldn't talk out of that.  But it could have been Freudian, too.  This motherfucker could be the most racist guy that's going,  another Martin Luther Kuhn Jr. day we got to sit through.  Huh, motherfuckers?  I mean, I got to do my weather.  Yeah, that's good.  I got to do my weather.  I'll be right back, though. 
[00:46:00]  Let's go to Ray in Virginia.  Ray.  Hey, man.  Hey.  Hey, you guys need to try to find the one where Shepard Smith makes a huge mistake.  He's talking about J-Lo.  You know how he always does his little funny little sayings he does?  He gets tongue-tied.  Yeah, I remember this one.  Do we have that one, Hawk?  Yeah, we're looking for it right now.  The Shepard Smith J-Lo comment.  What do you say?  The look on his face is priceless.  Then he apologizes. 
[00:46:30]  You can just see it on his face like he's saying, oh, I am so fine.  He says blowjob, basically.  Yeah.  Not basically.  He says blowjob.  No, he says blowjob instead of, I don't even remember what he was trying to say at the time.  Yeah, we'll try to find that one.  Damn it.  I love that one.  Thanks, buddy.  All right.  Thanks, man.  Bye.  Oh, that Celine Dion is just.  Oh, is she just a raving look?  She is so far from knowing what is going on in the real world.  Like, she was a star pretty young on. 
[00:47:00]  Yeah, she was a long time.  And just now in Vegas, she's got like some palatial mansion.  She goes to her own theater for a show every night.  What does she know about these people down there in New Orleans?  Nothing.  Nothing.  Thinking a kayak.  What the fuck?  That's a rich person recreational boat.  Yeah.  Is a kayak.  That's all she knows.  I've been kayaking once.  Take all rich people.  What?  No.  There's no polo ponies. 
[00:47:30]  Get the polo pony.  Take a gazebo.  Take three gazebos for the day.  I can love it.  If everybody's maid and butler just chipped in to pull these people out, they would be safe.  Oh, God.  Get them bidets.  Larry.  Get them some bidets.  I heard in the stadium that they were in, there were no bidets.  They're all going around with dirty heinies. 
[00:48:00]  Larry, what can we do to help?  I don't want to talk about money.  Is she a rip?  Let's go to Larry in Michigan.  Larry.  Hey, boy.  Call room service.  Have them send food down.  What's up, Larry?  Hey, do you remember in the 90s when Jesse Jackson was appearing at a UAW rally and the president  of the UAW had to introduce him, and he introduced him as Spear Chucker?  Oh.  What?  I don't remember that. 
[00:48:30]  Yeah.  Who would do that?  You can find it.  Look at the clip on the internet.  You'll find it.  Yeah, he introduced him.  And you know what the guy's thinking?  Talk about Freud.  And he's thinking, now I've got to get up there and introduce this motherfucking Spear Chucker.  Wow.  But he called him.  Yeah, I think he was going to call him a Spear Chucker.  Well, if you guys got these clips, you guys sent them into the show.  Oh, my God.  That's genius.  That doesn't even sound like Jesse Jackson, where you can trip it up.  Bear in Maryland.  Bear.  What's going on, fellas?  What's up, man?  Hey, how about that big knucklehead grease man?  What a little out of what a little out of what a little out of what a little day.  Remember when he did the Martin Luther King Day? 
[00:49:00]  If we just shot four more, we'd have a whole week off.  That's what I'm doing.  You never heard of that one?  Oh, shit.  Yeah.  This is innovative racism.  I didn't even hear this, man.  Oh, yeah.  He got fired for that one.  Yeah.  And then he comes back and gets fired for the...  No wonder they dragged them behind Trucks comment after they played...  What did they play?  Fugees?  I think it was a Fuji record he was checking out.  No.  What's her name?  From the Fugees.  Lauryn Hill.  Lauryn Hill. 
[00:49:30]  Plays the Lauryn Hill record.  Oh, that's the radio guy.  That's what I heard of that one.  Yeah.  The grease man.  What did he do?  And he played it.  And then he says, of course, not liking the music, he goes, well, no wonder they dragged them  behind Trucks.  Oh, fired.  Time for a bone dry.  I'm out of work.  Bone dry.  Water doodle.  Time for the old unemployment line.  And that issue was so sensitive. 
[00:50:00]  I mean, that was just...  That guy was ravaged.  Yeah.  Well, then he goes on TV to talk about what we did with the whole Sex with Sam thing.  And then after Sex with Sam, he's like, well, it was an inappropriate behavior for the radio.  All right, Mr. Drag him behind Trucks.  Yeah, right.  That is a...  Thanks for finding an expert.  That is something, that whole issue that happened with that guy was something that should have  been pulled from, like, footage from the 50s. 
[00:50:30]  You know what I mean?  Not even the 50s.  Like, that's the old 30s.  The first talkie film's racism.  Like, that is beyond...  Where Thomas Edison, they're like, oh, you know, drag a nigga behind the truck and Edison's  like, eh.  Mary had a little lamb.  Its fleece was white as snow.  And everywhere that Mary went, the lamb was sure to go.  No wonder they dragged them behind trucks. 
[00:51:00]  Watson, come quick.  I need you.  There's a colored person behind me.  But there was the grease man, like, right after it happened, too.  Just joking.  No wonder they dragged them behind trucks.  Oh, boot!  He got the boot.  Never recovered from that, either.  No.  He's on an AM station somewhere in the D.C. area.  AM selling his own commercial time.  Oh, wait.  This guy knows.  What a doodle.  Brian in D.C.  Brian?  Hey, grease man.  Back on the radio in D.C. 
[00:51:30]  Is he?  A Fox News affiliate.  I think it's like WMET 1160.  Oof.  Like I said, he's never recovered from that.  All right.  Thanks, sir.  Wait for the next fuck up.  How quick we just forgive.  Forgive and forget.  That goes to show you how little talent there is out there, though.  Holy shit.  Hold on, man.  Well, we forgive and forget the other way, too, because Jesse was fucking  Heimetown.  That should have just.  He should have been gone.  And here's the difference, though.  It's like Jesse didn't even go, whoops, oopsie-doo. 
[00:52:00]  He just goes, you know, Heimetown.  And it's just like.  Heimetown.  And you try to give him a chance to go, hey, Jesse.  Well, yeah, I understand what you mean.  Heimetown.  Yeah, I hear.  I hear.  You make a left at Jewville, and then you get on the Kike Highway, and they take you  over the Hebe Bridge right into Heimetown.  I'm going out to fly my Kike.  What did you just say?  Did you slip up?  No, I'm going to fly a Jew.  What?  Yeah, no apologies.  Nothing. 
[00:52:30]  Nothing.  I'm just flying Jew.  And there he is.  Whenever there's something, he's still on there.  Respected.  Everything.  Doesn't matter.  Heimetown.  Doesn't matter.  Fucking Al Sharpton was involved with that debacle case.  What's her name?  Tawana.  Tawana Brawley.  With Mason and Maddox, those wonderful lawyers that they were.  This bard.  And nothing.  He still, you know, gets up there.  He's respected.  He's more respected now than he's ever been.  Well, you know, we get to do a few things. 
[00:53:00]  Yeah, you get a free pass.  Yeah, they get the fuck up, too.  Come on.  We don't get reparations.  Those goddamn gooks got reparations.  Reparations.  They get money, those damn Japs, for being in a camp for two days.  We locked them up for a couple of weeks.  For a couple of weeks?  You locked us up for a couple of goddamn eons.  We never knew.  We can't be racist from time to time.  We never knew what the hell they were going to say.  Those Japs.  Now we got to back up a little bit.  We found the Shepard Smith.  Ah, Shep. 
[00:53:30]  J-Lo's new song, Jenny from the Block, all about Lopez roots, about how she's still a  neighborhood gal at heart.  But folks from that street in New York, the Bronx section, sound more likely to give her  a curb job than a blowjob or block party.  The New York Post.  Sorry about that slip up there.  I have no idea how that happened.  God bless Shepard.  Acknowledge it.  Watch your news and the G-Block, as Fox reports this Monday, November the 4th, 2002.  And still ahead, the most watched prime time in all of cable news. 
[00:54:00]  Yes.  All right.  Wow.  You can hear it in his voice.  Wow.  He's like, oh man, am I going to get through this?  And you can hear it in his voice.  Like, oh, damn.  What a pro, though.  He built his confidence back up.  Like, his motor stalled.  Yeah.  And he just started it back up.  Blowjob, boy, I didn't mean that.  That was a bad slip up.  A block party.  I'm sorry.  And then, let's get going now.  Let's do the crazy thing.  Coming up next, O'Reilly.  We hit the G-Block, baby. 
[00:54:30]  O'Reilly with some S-Sex.  Oh, fuck.  What a...  Oh, damn.  I didn't mean to say, I apologize for that.  But he kept himself getting fired because he acknowledged...  It's like, whoa, that was...  Sorry.  That was just a slip up.  He didn't pretend.  No one could say it.  That's what you got to do.  Be human.  Acknowledge it.  Be human.  All right.  Let's go to Fled in Pennsylvania.  Fled.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I was wondering if you remember when Doug Williams was...  He was the first black quarterback to play in his Super Bowl.  And some chick, the first question out of her mouth was, 
[00:55:00]  excuse me, how long have you been black?  Wow.  Are you kidding?  I swear to God.  It's got to be somewhere out there.  I have to look for it.  Yeah.  Once again, if you guys have these clips,  please send them in to Steve at foundrymusic.com.  Thanks.  All right.  Bunch now.  I think we have one more.  We'll take a break finally.  Let's say hi to Chris from whackbag.com.  Chris?  Hey.  Love your show, guys.  Thanks, Chris.  Hey.  Do you remember back in 94 when Bill Clinton was being interviewed on BET  and he said, and I quote, doing the fucking air quotes here in the car, 
[00:55:30]  and he says, and I quote,  such a fucking faggot.  Ass.  You know who's ass?  Anyway, he said, black people watch the same TV news at night that regular people watch.  And that's what white people think.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, you know, they're almost like real people.  They're almost regular.  Really?  You know who Nirvana is?  You're really regular.  That is hysterical.  You was irregular before. 
[00:56:00]  There are times, though, you don't know what to say.  Like there'll be maybe a kid with Down syndrome or something,  and you'll see him do something that amazes you that they're actually capable of doing that.  And you'll say, wow, he was doing it like a normal person or a regular person.  And that is so un-PC, but it's the truth.  That's what it is.  Right.  You say normal person, and then people argue, well, what is normal?  You know, you're judging what's normal. 
[00:56:30]  No.  I know that ain't normal.  That ain't the norm.  I thought, see, I thought every time you said something,  every time a person says something that's politically incorrect,  like you go, oh, wow, I thought that was something normal.  I thought that only you got offended,  and the person you was talking about didn't give a shit.  Right.  But I thought midgets was something that regular tall people was getting angry at.  Midgets don't like the word midget.  No, they hate it.  I thought midgets, hey, you little midget.  And he's like, hey, that's what I am, baby. 
[00:57:00]  But he's like, I am a little person.  Little person.  Motherfucker, you a midget.  Little person.  What?  You're not a little person.  That puts too much pressure on me to be considerate of your fucking thing  that is evidently a problem.  You know what I'm saying?  It's like you are a goddamn midget, motherfucker.  Don't put me in a bad spot.  What is so wrong about that, too?  It's a great word.  What's wrong with midget?  What is wrong with that word?  I don't understand.  Man, it was never used as a derogatory term towards midgets, towards little people. 
[00:57:30]  It was just never like, you fucking midget.  You know, hey, don't use the M word.  I'm going to be picked.  You know, it's just what they were.  And then all of a sudden, they just decided, no, midget is a bad word now.  We want to be called little people.  What do you think they was calling one a set of odds?  On the Wizard of Oz.  Get the fucking midgets.  Get over there.  Here's the midgets on the set.  Midgets on the set.  We're doing the yellow brick road scene. 
[00:58:00]  Midgets to the set, please.  And you know, they weren't like, motherfuckers calling us midgets again.  Okay, but we're little people.  Hey, director.  Down here.  We're fucking little people, asshole.  You know, we're not going to answer to midget anymore.  All right, little people for the set.  Thank you.  Much better, motherfucker.  It doesn't happen like that.  Is this midget cursing me the fuck out?  You better get out of my face with your thumb arms if I toss you through a window. 
[00:58:30]  And you know, you know back then, they were a dime a dozen, too.  Like, they weeded them out with frigging testing and shit.  With genetics and shit.  Genetics.  Like, there's a fucking doctor.  The second you shoot a load inside your woman, he could be bedside going,  Oh, it's going to be a midget.  Kill it.  I saw the test that we did.  I could see by the residue left on your mattress.  You're a fucking midget.  You want, I'll bring the equipment in right now.  We got a vacuum.  We'll suck that fucker right out.  You don't have to worry about having to be embarrassed for the rest of your life. 
[00:59:00]  But back then?  That was a dwarf-y load.  Back then?  That one load was dwarf-y.  God damn.  Back then, one of those motherfuckers mouth off about little people,  they swing the door to MGM open.  Any midgets want a job?  Any midgets?  Oh, hey, I'm there.  Follow the yellow big code.  And then a bunch of midgets come running over the hill like gremlins.  Wait, wait, wait.  We only need ten.  All the time.  One midget comes and then looks back and does the wave and it's 10,000 midgets. 
[00:59:30]  What was it like back in the fucking 30s?  Midgets galore.  They're the ones who wrote that song, Hi-Ho.  They came in.  Hi-Ho.  Hi-Ho.  It's off to work, Rico.  How many you need?  We got 50.  We only need ten fucking midgets.  How are we going to control all these midgets?  Don't worry.  The king of the midgets.  Attention.  Like Denzel from Malcolm X, he just held his hand up and did the point and all the midgets  left.  Brought the midgets down to the MGM theater. 
[01:00:00]  There's some midgets out there that need work.  Listen, take these motherfuckers and go.  And then the woman in the carpet then goes, no midget should have this much power.  You're right, nigga.  As-salamu alaykum.  Goddamn midgets.  Nowadays, though, you know, you got to-  Little people, man.  There's only a few of them.  You don't see them just trucking down the street as many as you used to.  Wow.  In the 20s, it was- 
[01:00:30]  In the 20s, it was all over.  The whole world was half midget.  Little midget hands doing the Charleston.  Hey, baby, you want to shake a leg at the Cotton Club tonight?  Now you're hard-pressed to find one.  I could go a month.  Hard-pressed.  It's a hard-pressed to find a midget.  Cash up, nigga.  All my niggas in the P now, right now. 
[01:01:00]  Bubby, Hockey, Bubby, shoot.  We're doing it out here, nigga.  We're about to all the millions.  You hear me?  All I got to say to XM Satellite is-  Fuck my dick, because y'all ain't give me no money.  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  XM Radio, cash up, all day, everything.  Get that bitch, nigga.  Stop pushing me.  Fuck you, bitch.  Wee!  I just got wowed.  That's a big old hootie donor.  Let me see you, and Bubby!  It's the O.B. and Anthony Wow Line.  If you're on the road and you get wowed, we want to know about it.

And if your message isn't too stupid, we just might use it on the air.  Ooh!  The Technophile.  Hi, I'm Laszlo.  Mobile phone providers are making a lot of noise about their watch TV on the go services.  And of course, it costs and adds even more to your monthly bill. 
[01:02:00]  In parts of Europe and Asia, they're rolling out free TV services for mobile devices like phones and PDAs.  It's called Digital Multimedia Broadcasting, or DMB.  And the picture looks amazing.  Watching mobile television and video entertainment is the big push for manufacturers.  And while devices like the iPod have a video screen built in,  some companies believe that the video screen should be built into sunglasses.  We already have MP3 sunglasses, and if manufacturers have their way,  small video screens less than an eighth of an inch will be built into glasses as well. 
[01:02:30]  With the screen that close to your eye, it looks quite large.  The plan is to, by next year, deliver video to your glasses from an iPod or PDA wirelessly by a Bluetooth.  But do we really need to be watching movies while walking?  I'm Laszlo.  That's what's on my underground hard drive.  Who framed Roger Rabbit?  Where in the world is Carmen Sandiego?  And what's on my XM?  XM.  Well, tomorrow on your XM at 2 p.m. in the West, 5 p.m. in the East on Soul Street Channel 60.

[01:04:30]  All right, let me unzip.  Jess Fowl from D.C. checking in.  He writes,  Badass, O.P., bullying someone smaller.  You know, that's just honesty.  That is just honesty in human nature.  People will size up the person that they're pissed off with,  and if they know they can take them, then they're a little tougher.  That's the reality of it.  It's not bullying if they're bigger than you.  I was just going to say that, yeah.  It's amazing and heroic.  And dumb.  And stupid, incredibly stupid. 
[01:05:00]  Most people get a lot tougher when they think they can take the person.  And that's just human nature.  I mean, when you have, like, road rage,  and you see some kind of soccer mom in a minivan,  you're pretty damn tough on the highway, aren't you?  You're cutting her off.  You're jamming on your brakes.  You're beeping your horn.  You're giving her the finger.  But if it's, you know, a bunch of black dudes from Compton  that have, you know, rap music cranking,  are you doing the same thing?  Are you doing the same thing?  Yes, I am.  Yeah, right.  Under my breath.  Not looking. 
[01:05:30]  Besides, if they're from Compton,  they probably wouldn't be driving here.  Well, yeah, but I'm trying, it's a national show,  so I'm trying to, like, all of a sudden,  wow, hey, they're broadcasting from L.A. somewhere.  See, I'm smart.  But you know what I'm saying.  Yeah.  That's how it is.  Yes, it is.  You want me to act like, oh, no, you know,  I take on all comers, man.  The bigger, the better.  Yeah, if you're 6'4", 300, I'm not scared of you.  No, the reality is you take on people you know you can take.  It's just how much smaller than you they are 
[01:06:00]  that makes you a pussy.  If it's pretty evenly matched, then you're, you know,  you're not a pussy or anything or a bully.  If he's slightly weaker, that's a great advantage for you,  and you'll probably do some damage.  But if they're really pathetically geeky, weak,  and, you know, a lot smaller than you,  then, I don't know.  And in a wheelchair.  You know, a great example.  It's a story that...  Maybe you should walk away from the situation.  A great example comes up on the show from time to time,  the, you know, the time I hit that dude  when we were driving, home from work, okay? 
[01:06:30]  Anthony and I used to have road rage  like no one's business, especially Anthony.  I mean, he was ridiculous.  I've seen you.  You know, you do get tougher  depending on who's pissing you off.  I'm so much more relaxed now.  And so when I hit the guy in the crosswalk with my car,  he turned out to be a big, tough mother effer.  Yeah, he was a tough guy.  And when he took out my, you know,  side view mirror with one punch...  Emasculated you right then and there.  And it wasn't, yeah, it wasn't a small side view  we've talked about.  It's one of those very involved ones 
[01:07:00]  with the, you know, the cords and stuff.  Yeah.  As soon as he knocked that off my car with one punch,  I'm like, hey, sorry, neighbor.  Okay, let me just...  You have a good day.  Hey, let me get out of your way.  But if it was like some fat bitch from,  I don't know, Idaho or something  that was in Manhattan  and she hit the side of my, you know,  and she punched out my side view  and it was just a lucky shot.  Right.  Am I jumping out of the vehicle at that point?  Of course I am. 
[01:07:30]  Hey.  But Anthony and I couldn't get out of that situation fast enough.  We locked the doors.  We didn't make eye contact.  We're like, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.  Please turn, you know,  please get out of my way so we can continue.  I don't like being hit.  It hurts.  That's another thing about getting...  Makes you feel funny.  That's another thing about getting older.  Yeah.  Getting hit in the face really does suck.  No, no.  When you're...  You know something?  Getting hit in the face is for your 20s.  That's for guys in their 20s.  The second you hit 30 is no more getting hit in the face. 
[01:08:00]  And once you really get into the mid, late 30s,  there should be no situation ever where you are being hit in the face.  Because it, like I said, it does hurt  and it makes you feel really funny right after it happens.  You're all woozy.  Perhaps you fall down.  Yeah.  Hurting yourself even further.  Last time I got punched in the face, I was 19.  19?  Yeah.  Yeah.  The last time I was punched in the face, 15 years old. 
[01:08:30]  15 years old.  I'd been in fights after that, but never got hit in the face again.  And this was...  It was in California.  I believe it was Compton.  And I was hanging...  No, it was California though.  San Juan Capistrano.  And this kid from school comes up to me  and he starts like open-handed slap boxing a little  in front of the strip mall.  And I just...  I'm not a fighter. 
[01:09:00]  I don't know technique or anything.  If I get into a fight,  or when I used to get into the fights when I was a kid  and never really got into that many,  it was always just about the dirtiest way to fight  to end it as quickly as possible.  I'm not a finesse guy that can outbox people,  but I'll kick you in the balls.  I'll gouge out your eyes.  Just some way to end it.  So a slap boxing, you can't use that strategy  because you don't know if it's serious or not.  You're pissed off and all of a sudden you guys go,  all right, it's going to be a slap boxing fight? 
[01:09:30]  No, he was just like, I didn't like him.  He didn't like me, but we never fought.  And he just steps up.  He's like, hey, Cumia, what's up, man?  And takes a couple of these half-hearted swipes open-handed at me.  So I kind of put a block up and kind of, you know,  I'm looking at what he's doing.  What are you doing, the rope-a-dope?  Rope-a-dope.  Yo, yo.  So he kind of sent my head back with this little right-hand slap.  And when my head came back forward,  this left-hand full-fisted punch was waiting for me right in the eye. 
[01:10:00]  Down goes Cumia.  Down goes Cumia.  Someone stop the fight.  Down goes Cumia.  I was on my ass before I knew what happened,  and I couldn't see out of that eye.  I can't see, god damn it.  And blood just gushing from my brow, like, completely split my lid open.  And then him and his friends were like,  laughing at me.  They could have just pulled my pants down and raped me. 
[01:10:30]  It was just totally emasculated.  Cumia Bombayé.  Yeah, and that was just, that was the last time I was hit in the face.  Hit in the head, man.  Just stinks.  It's just awful getting hit in the face.  I got caught with a woman.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh, I think you told a story once.  I'm telling the air.  I'm not, maybe way in the beginning.  We have a whole new audience now.  What happened?  I was 19.  This is a great story. 
[01:11:00]  Figures, too.  Of course you were caught with a woman, you horny little bastard.  Well, I was, I was seeing this woman casually, um, we never actually, uh, had sex.  I think maybe once for a couple seconds, but maybe not even.  And she was separated, she was separated from a guy.  They were married.  And all she would tell me about this guy was what, like, he lived with a girlfriend, though.  And, uh, all she would say is what a maniac he was and how he used to like to fight cops.  But, like, he was, he was like a true psycho.  He was what Ope was just talking about.  He was the type of guy that the bigger you are, the more likely he was to try to punch you in the face. 
[01:11:30]  Like, if he was, if five cops jumped on him, he was really ready to fight.  Right.  He was like an animal.  Yeah, there are guys like that out there, I understand.  That just, that don't want a way out.  They want to.  Yeah, but in general, most people.  A taser and a billy club.  Yeah.  But most people just will size up.  Most people, yeah.  Someone weaker.  But there are those guys out there that'll take on anybody.  I understand that.  She lived over, uh, uh, uh, like a pub.  So one night we were laying there on the couch just kissing.  And, um, we weren't doing anything sexual, really. 
[01:12:00]  And I hear, um, the sound of like, let me see.  Which I think, I hear this knock on the wood.  And I'm like, is somebody downstairs taking a broom handle and knocking the ceiling?  I'm like, what is that about?  Maybe Opie's down there.  Yes, exactly.  Maybe there's a man laying rocks who doesn't approve of the loud smacking of our lips.  The loud smooching.  And then I'm kissing.  I'm laying down.  All that's on is the light of the TV.  And I hear her go, oh my God.  Oh my God.  No way.  Oh, that's not good. 
[01:12:30]  Oh, and you're thinking, hmm, let me turn around.  I hope the prize patrol's there with a big million dollar check.  Well, I'm not thinking anything.  I felt two hands on my back.  Oh no.  And I saw white.  I never saw it.  I just saw white.  I got punched in the face so fast and so hard twice.  I saw stars.  Twice?  Dude.  Don't, don't.  It was, I didn't, I just felt hands, stars.  And the next thing I know, he's flipping the lights on.  And I'm sitting on the floor.  One of my contact lenses was out. 
[01:13:00]  My mouth is all swollen up.  And he is standing up.  He was about six foot.  And he's breathing heavy.  And he's telling his wife that he went out and did cocaine.  Oh man.  He's like, and I'm going to kill him.  You know I'm going to kill him, don't you?  And he's, and he's, he's referring to me in, in, in, as if I'm not there.  Like I'm a real old person.  You're dead already.  Oh dude.  It was.  You couldn't, uh, there was no way to run out of the second floor.  They lived on the second floor.  He was blocking the door.  Oh my God.  You are done.  I just sat there. 
[01:13:30]  I'm like, uh.  You gotta go for the window.  And I didn't make the, uh, so I had met him before at another place and never made the  association.  Yeah.  He was married, you know, whatever.  He was living with another girl.  He just freaked out one night.  Yeah.  Bring that up to him.  I almost said, you know, technically good thing you didn't come in last night, elbow  to the ribs.  But, um, he was actually one of those guys that because I just kind of sat there, she  mellowed him out.  She, she told me like the next day, she's like, the only reason he didn't like kill you  or throw you through the window is because you, you sat there and, and you were, you 
[01:14:00]  were kind of small.  You were submissive.  He was just the opposite of, oh, like I sat there and I had no, he didn't, so he was  like, he couldn't just attack me sitting there.  And he walks me to the door and he goes, uh, he emailed out and he's like, look, I know,  you know, she was my wife.  Just tell me, you know, she was my wife and I'll let you go.  If you do, if you don't tell me that, that sounds like a setup.  If you don't tell me, I'm going to kill you.  Oh, that's a setup.  And, uh, what do you do?  I said, uh, well, you're going to have to kill me because I didn't know.  And, uh, did you know that? 
[01:14:30]  Um, no, I, well, I had, I, I knew like when I met him, I didn't, but then I had seen his  face like later and I made the, like, oh, okay.  But when I met him, I hadn't.  Um, but I did like, you know what I mean?  I could, I should have said yes, technically, but, uh, and then he opened the door.  Don't insult my intelligence.  Just tell me you were the one that fingered Sonny.  That's the same gag he's playing on you.  Yeah, it was, uh, yeah, it was, it was Pazzini.  It was Pazzini.  And, uh, good.  Get out of my sight. 
[01:15:00]  So I, I wound up walking out and I, I, I got in a car and, uh.  Big fat guy behind you.  Clemenza said, hello.  Hello, Jim.  Went through the windshield and we drove off.  And I made the little, eeeh, my feet made the squeaky sound on the window as I was being  strangled.  No, I just drove home and everybody at work the next day is like, what'd you get punched in  the face?  And I'm like, and my dad even asked me.  No, I fell on the treadmill.  Yeah, I fell on a, it happened to have a class ring on it.  I think we have audio of you after you got punched in the face.  Oh.  Oh, that is really annoying. 
[01:15:30]  Oh, that is really annoying.  Oh, right.  All right.  Alright, alright, alright. 
[01:16:00]  Ow, ow, ow, ow!  Oh, stop, oh, stop!  I can't breathe.  You're not being fair.  You're not being fair.  Oh, exactly!  Exactly.  Wow.  He punched you twice in the head and then let you go.  Dude, I never saw it coming.  I never saw his face until I was on the floor looking up in the lights.  That was what was so scary. 
[01:16:30]  Because there was no lights on, just the TV.  And I went from one reality to the other.  Like, I just, it was.  Instant.  Yeah.  I'm actually probably in hindsight glad I didn't see him coming.  Because I was 19.  I wasn't a tough guy.  But I would have at least, you know, when there's a larger man coming out, you can't just sit there.  You have to at least stand up.  Try to defend yourself.  And that would have been, he probably would have picked up a TV and cracked it over my face.  Because he was.  Well, he should have.  A psycho.  Yeah.  Adulterer.  No, he was, you know, I should have pointed out that, look, technically, sir, you are involved in another relationship.  And she's moved on.  But I felt it was. 
[01:17:00]  How about I come over when you're having sex, sir, and punch you in the face.  That's right.  Some girl that isn't your wife.  I know.  Hey, this is Dennis Leary listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Yes, Anthony.  The Today Show is doing a story.  Make room for puggles.  Make sure we get the audio.  New top dog for this story.  Make room for puggles.  It's, look at them.  How cute is that?  Could be the cutest little thing I've ever seen.  All it needs is a little happy face.  Hitler shirt.  Just a fuzzy little cutie pie.  We'll get back to the no filter Paul thing. 
[01:17:30]  But speaking of the puggles, right?  Yes.  Yesterday it was on the front page of the New York Post.  Yes, it was.  That's how important of a story it is.  Very popular little doggie is the pug mixed with a beagle.  You mix anything with a beagle.  I don't care.  It's coming out adorable.  Look at it.  That is very cute.  Little triangular ears dangling.  I bet if you whistle, they turn their heads sideways and go, and it's the cutest thing.  You know what?  But they don't use a lot of science in this crossbreeding. 
[01:18:00]  How many ugly ass dogs?  Right.  You know they're trying to combine all sorts of dogs.  That's what I want to see.  To make the next trend.  I want to see the website where they show the disasters they're coming up with.  The genetic disasters that aren't huge.  The genetic disasters.  It's like, well, we thought this would work, but.  The pit oodle.  The pit oodle.  It tells me the pit oodle didn't come out too well.  No. 
[01:18:30]  Could you imagine?  Because you know that's what they're doing.  Yeah.  There's no, uh, there's no, uh, regulations.  We tried a Doberman Opser.  We tried to destroy it.  Just look at it.  It's a mess.  It was scaring the children.  Ah, the puggles are on it today, Joe.  They have an entire set full of little puggles.  And I have to be honest with you, they smell really good.  I love puppies smell.  They even smell good, little puppies.  The only thing I get nervous about, people either want purebreds or they want these now designer mutts. 
[01:19:00]  I worry about the regular old mutts that are in shelters and things like that.  Don't worry, Matt.  Shut up, Matt.  They're simply adorable.  I don't know.  Not everybody has a dog.  It's a staff symbol, right?  That's true.  Anyway, we'll be back in a moment.  All right.  Thank you, Joe.  I just want to lay in a litter of puggles and pet them.  Wouldn't you just lay down and have their little pointy puppy teeth bite you while they  go, grr, grr.  Aw.  Adorable.  Anyway, it was on the front page of the New York Post yesterday, so there's a follow-up 
[01:19:30]  story in the paper today.  Post sets off puggle struggle.  Puggle struggle.  There's now a puggle struggle.  What happened?  I know the struggle.  The puggle is now officially a star after the Post put the hot new hybrid cross between  a beagle and a pug on the front page yesterday.  Area pet stores were swamped with people clamoring for the hot new pooch.  I want a puggle.  I must have gotten 100 phone calls this morning from people looking for puggles, says Brian  of some blah, blah puppy place. 
[01:20:00]  Everyone is driving me crazy.  People had the Post in their hands begging for the dogs.  They had the paper there going, one of these.  I need one of these.  My daughter wants a puggle.  Because that's what they are.  Right.  They're all these rich bitches going in there for their kid that wants it for Christmas.  Mommy, I want a puggle.  I want a puggle.  We'll get you a puggle in her little coffee clotches, and we're getting a puggle.  We're getting a puggle this Christmas.  My daughter wants...  What do you mean you don't have a puggle? 
[01:20:30]  My daughter wants a puggle.  God, you know how many puggles are going to be under the Christmas tree this year?  A little bowl.  Stop it.  Not with a little red bow around his little neck.  Maybe there's been a gas leak, so she comes out and she notices her puggle is stiff and  doesn't move a lot.  A little puggle leg sticking straight out.  Stop it.  Mama, a stuffed puggle?  Oh, yeah.  And who's the parent?  Mommy, puggle's cold.  His nose is dry. 
[01:21:00]  Mommy, puggle doesn't want to play.  He's not fetching.  Fetch.  I roll the ball and it just goes over his face and head.  And who's going to be the parent that doesn't find a puggle for their kid so it just settles  by getting a pug?  Because it's half puggle?  It's just as good as a puggle.  No, it's not.  I wanted a puggle.  No, I hear the puggle's a very mean and nasty dog. 
[01:21:30]  So we just got you a pug.  My friend has a puppy.  She's like a pit bull breed puppy and she lives on the 13th or 14th floor.  Oh, that's lovely.  And her door was open and the puppy ran up onto the roof and they're doing construction  and just ran right off the roof.  Holy shit.  Wow.  Wow, right off the edge.  A little pit bull puppy. 
[01:22:00]  What is that stupid thing thinking on the way down?  Well, you know what it is?  What is it thinking?  Like, wee!  Oh, this...  Probably, uh, this little paws are probably moving and looking for like, expecting like  something like concrete or whatever to just cushion me under there, but...  I was just running like puppies do.  And now I'm, uh...  That's great.  Hey, uh...  Gone.  Let's go to Dennis in Virginia.  Hey, man.  Hey, Dennis.  Hey, January.  Everybody, I'll just save their money.  Come January, you'll be able to get them half off at your local shelter as soon as they 
[01:22:30]  piss on the floor and piss people off.  That's true.  There you go.  A lot of times they say you should never get pets for holidays, things like that, birthdays.  I'm going to go on record and say the puggle is too good to be true.  Too good?  You mean there's some kind of genetic problem?  There's going to be some kind of problem.  Maybe they're not even telling us.  They only live for eight months.  Maybe the puggle has to...  Just enough to get attached to it.  Maybe the puggle has to shit every 45 minutes, but they're not telling anybody.  And it's liquid in butterscotch color.  And it projects. 
[01:23:00]  They shit straight out.  Like a little rocket-propelled puggle.  Let me tell you what's going to happen, because I definitely see into the future with a lot of  things, okay?  Predict for us.  It's not even a prediction.  I just see this stuff, okay?  Yeah.  Everyone's going to get puggles.  They're going to be all the rage for the next three or four months.  They're going to be under Christmas trees like you wouldn't believe, just like we said,  Okay?  Well, they should be.  And then the middle of winter.  Oh, no. 
[01:23:30]  February.  Totally cold here on the northeast, right?  Oh, I see.  That stupid puggle, because now it's a little older and not as cute, is going to be chained  up in the goddamn backyard.  Shaking.  Just shaking.  Just shaking.  As you're inside, it's going to be looking into the windows and the glass doors of your  fine home.  Yeah.  And shut up out there!  And it's not going to be able to look too good, because it's going to be kind of frosted  over those windows, because there's so much heat inside.  And you're going to be enjoying some TV or a little get- 
[01:24:00]  Crackling fire.  Get together with your friends and family, and the fire's going to be crackling.  Wine.  And the puggle's going to just be outside looking in.  Pugsy!  How many of you'll name them Pugsy?  Mama, scooter's cold!  Keep him out!  He shit's all over the place!  He's your dog!  You clean it up!  That's what happens with most of these puppies.  The puggle.  They're cute until they get a little older, and then-  Ugh!  Because it's all about you, isn't it? 
[01:24:30]  I hope puggles age badly, and that their balls just get really big and heavy, and drag  around everything.  Like, no matter where they go, there's like a slug trail of ball sweat.  There's like 18 hairs left on his body.  Looks like one of those, like Pumba from The Lion King, one of those damn fucking big things.  Shitting straight out.  So there's like a foot high, like butterscotch-colored lion everywhere in the house, just all against  the walls and the doors and the bed curtains. 
[01:25:00]  Nothing worse than like wet, old dog smell.  That's just there.  That's the future of the puggle.  Look how cute.  It's the latest fad, though.  Or when you scratch his belly, when you roll him over and scratch his belly, I hope the  puggle just ejaculates really hard and fast.  Hey, what do we got going on outside our glass today?  Who are these creeps?  We have a show every day.  I'm not talking about the show we do.  We actually have a show outside our window every day. 
[01:25:30]  Well, we have a live audience.  And there's people outside the studio every day on the sidewalk now.  What the hell is going on?  You show up on the sidewalk.  You talk to Master Poe.  Next thing you know, you're sitting 10 feet away from us.  Checking out the show live.  Yeah, so they're saying the puggle is like the new designer gene, the doggy gene that fits  just right, Anthony.  Yes, it does.  And there's a waiting list of 60 people for this one breeder.  Brooklyn's Puppy Paradise also received more than 100 phone calls from people looking for 
[01:26:00]  the dogs and is expecting their next puggle delivery on November 9th.  It's all about the puggles.  November 9th, another shipment coming in.  You know there's these, like, breeding factories.  I know they have, like, some kind of name for those places that they just breed and make  money out of these things.  And they're just hooking them up, just trying to get these things to screw so they can sell  more.  By the way, which dog gets to fuck?  Is it the pug?  Is the pug mounting the beagle? 
[01:26:30]  Or is the beagle mounting the pug?  And does it make a difference in your puggle?  Yeah, we need an expert.  We need some type of expert.  When's the next big delivery?  November 9th?  Yeah.  November 8th, you're going to hear about some kind of an accident on the LIE.  Like, a drunk driver barrels into a truck full of puggles.  Just a flaming truck full of puggles.  Firemen are there.  They're just yelping.  They can't get them out.  Better.  A school bus hits a truck full of puggles.  The crying little children and burning puppies. 
[01:27:00]  Mr. Help the puggles!  People are always trying to figure out what's different about our show than every other  show.  Here it is right here.  Today's show thinks it's the cutest little thing.  It's adorable.  They can't get enough puggles on their set.  Oh, puppy farms.  That's what they call them.  Yeah, they're puppy farms, right?  They call them a puppy farm.  And something like this is just cha-ha-ha-ha-ching.  They are smelling money.  And they know it's a limited thing. 
[01:27:30]  So before people move on from puggles, they're going to want to pump out as many of these things  as possible.  And you know who suffers?  The puggle, Opie?  No, not the puggle.  The puggle will get the homes.  You go to these pet stores and there's a bunch of cute little dogs.  Oh, the dogs that aren't puggles.  The cute dogs that aren't puggles will sit there in the pet shops week after week, getting  slightly older every week, until guess what?  Guess.  Guess.  Well, good. 
[01:28:00]  That's right.  Because you just pinged a little memory in my head from my married life again.  And then one day, it's midnight, the back door opens, a guy comes in and empties the  cages.  And where do the dogs go?  Where do they go?  Where do the older dogs go?  Where do they go?  They were puppies.  Because then the next morning, they're open for business and there's a whole bunch of new  cute little dogs in their place.  They're puppies again.  They're puppies again. 
[01:28:30]  What do they do?  What do they do?  Oh, we don't want to think about this, do we, as a society?  What?  But there's a doggy killer out there somewhere.  That works in the middle of the night.  They take the puppies into the back room and they put like a little towel around his head  and they just hit it with a hammer.  Oh, God.  Jesus, Jim.  This is called make room for Puggle.  We don't need you anymore, stupid.  They're just kicking the dogs out one by one. 
[01:29:00]  Nice hammer on that towel.  Crunchy.  When I was married, the wife decides that this is going to be a great thing to get a dog.  Right.  I guess that'll complete our happy little family.  So I'm totally against it because I hate fucking animals in houses.  I hate them.  They ruin your house.  I don't care if you love them. 
[01:29:30]  They're cute.  Puggles are adorable.  Look at me.  I would go out tomorrow and get one if you could put a cork in his little ass and tie his dick  in a knot.  I'd have a Puggle tomorrow.  It would look like an engorged dick in a week walking around my house.  But I would have one and I'd have to pull his teeth out with pliers.  You know, he could ruin those little feet on my couch.  By the way, that's why the Puggles' eyes are so big.  Yeah.  I think the dog has a problem shitting.  Well, we will find out the genetic problems with the Puggle.  In a matter of time. 
[01:30:00]  I hate it.  I hate how they destroy places.  They chew on your walls.  It's just a mess.  And if you let them in the house at all, I don't care.  Oh, no, he's an outside dog.  No, shut up.  You let him in, pet him under the chin for two seconds.  Your couch stinks.  Your whole place smells.  You can walk in and go, oh, you want a dog, don't you?  I smell dog.  It just, it's the way it is.  And some people's love can overcome that.  Mine cannot.  Short-haired dogs aren't as bad, though.  They aren't as bad.  So what happened?  They're just bad.  So she is like, I want a dog. 
[01:30:30]  You already had four cats.  I know.  Way to rule your house with an iron fist, by the way.  For someone that hates animals.  Jesus Christ, you had four cats.  I ruled with a lump of ramen noodles.  That's how I ruled my house.  After they were cooked.  She just was the boss.  The boss.  Because, God forbid, I said anything.  What are you telling me? 
[01:31:00]  It would start a fight that would just last.  A drunken fight that would go on for days.  Motherfucking, fucking fuck.  And it wouldn't make any sense, and I couldn't sleep.  So I go, look, you're going to go down to the North Shore Animal League,  wherever the hell she was going, to get a dog.  I go, get something cute.  I don't care what it is, because that's the only way I'll appreciate it  for at least a limited time, maybe until I get attached to it.  It's just something.  Just something. 
[01:31:30]  I go, don't let them talk you into an older dog.  What does she come home with?  An older dog.  The thing is full of bad habits.  It's like adopting a crack friggin' teen.  Not even a crack baby.  The thing runs around.  The first thing it does.  You can have fun with a crack teen.  No.  Oh, a crack teen you could.  Not a crack dog.  Dog can't go out and suck dick and make some money for the house.  It runs away. 
[01:32:00]  This dog's big, big thing was running away from you.  And you go, come here.  And I can't even remember its name.  Come here.  Come here.  And it would stop and get all excited.  And then the second you get like three feet from it, it takes off down the neighborhood.  I'm chasing it, I'm chasing it, trying to get it.  And talk about shitting.  Dude, this thing shit everywhere.  All over the house.  Just a shit mess all over the place. 
[01:32:30]  A mutt?  Oh, yeah.  Some kind of fucking collie, Labrador.  There was some German Shepherd in there.  It was just a wreck.  A wreck of a mess of a dog.  And I finally had it and brought it back to the pound.  And hopefully it had just been, not even gassed.  That's too good for this dog.  I like Jimmy's hammer and towel method.  Sometimes it's fun to go to the pound and get puppies and bring them home for a day. 
[01:33:00]  And then go, ha ha, and then bring it back.  I just wanted to show you what you're missing.  Feed it, pet it, love it.  Back you go.  A little soft thing where no other dogs are snipping at it.  And then right back it goes in the cold cage.  Beat it, stupid.  Pizza Granny catches convicts.  All right.  Maybe we could see what that's all about this morning as well.  Anyway, the Today Show talking about the- 
[01:33:30]  How does a dog chew on walls?  It eats up the corner bead on your walls, taint licker.  His name is an interesting name.  Why do people question us every day?  Of course.  Dogs chew on walls.  Why do people question us every day?  Why do they question Anthony?  Let's be honest.  Never question me.  Yeah.  I'm only wrong.  I'm wrong quite a bit.  All right.  Here's the Today Show talking about the new craze, the Puggle.  Well, or this one.  Meet Parker.  He's half Pug, half Beagle. 
[01:34:00]  Twenty years ago, you might have called him a mutt.  But today, he's called a Puggle.  And he's top dog.  Puggles are a so-called hybrid breed that Shari Geisinger first spotted on the streets of New York.  Just walking around the city, I see these cute little dogs with big ears and, you know, the big cute eyes.  And I ask people, oh my God, it's the cutest dog.  What is that?  And they said, a Puggle.  Shari knew she just had to have one, so she found Parker online and bought him from a greeter for $600. 
[01:34:30]  I feel like he's priceless now.  Yeah, he's like my little son.  $600 a Puggle?  All the celebrities are going to be walking around with Puggles now.  Puggles.  It's all about the Puggles.  Angelina Jolie will have one.  Yes.  Their new Puggle.  Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie and their new Puggle.  Foreign baby and a Puggle.  That's what celebrities are going to have.  That's what you need.  All right, listen.  I found the downside of owning a Puggle. 
[01:35:00]  Can't be.  Audio just coming in, Anthony.  The cuteness just offsets everything.  Audio just coming in.  Okay.  There's a downside to everything.  We all know that.  Yeah.  This is what's wrong with the Puggle if you own one.  For many days, I didn't bring him here because I suffer when he bites me.  He bites me on my vagina.  When I'm walking and he sees all the dogs, right away, he jumps on my vagina because he gets so crazy.  He doesn't know who I am.  He forgets everything. 
[01:35:30]  And he bites the Labrador on his penis.  I don't want him to bite my Labrador and the penis.  My Labrador is a baby.  It's beautiful.  Puggles are biting vaginas?  And other dogs' penises.  Yes, Anthony.  That could be a downside.  This is the downside of the Puggle.  Look, in my vagina, two times he bites me.  But his teeth are very small.  And they don't damage very much.  They just, they pinch.  Pinching and biting vaginas. 
[01:36:00]  They binge.  Yes.  More audio from the Today Show.  Talking about the Puggles today.  Come on.  It's a simple case of supply and demand.  According to recent statistics, Puggles now account for 50% of all mixed breed sales.  In fact, pet stores across the country can't keep them in stock.  These guys are like, it's popular as, should we say, Yankee tickets during season.  It was the Labradoodle from Australia that started this hybrid trend over a decade ago. 
[01:36:30]  Mixed breeds instantly became a hit.  And now the Puggle has reached designer doggy status.  All right, mixing the breeds is a hit, but there's some disasters out there.  Right.  What happens to them?  Someone direct me to a website where they talk about the disasters.  The little ones that don't come out as cute as the Puggle.  Yeah, because the government's not getting involved.  No, there's no regulation.  They're just crossbreeding everything.  They wrote two dogs in a room.  The shepherd dachshund that kills itself because it scrapes its huge cock on the ground and dies. 
[01:37:00]  Puggle.  They are probably, there are probably places, I swear to you, just running around looking for beagles and pugs just to throw them together.  That's what, like, the beagle pug population is probably tight right now.  Probably hard to find them to throw them in a room and get them banging so you can make a buck.  Six hundred bucks for a Puggle?  The litters, how big is a litter?  Usually. 
[01:37:30]  Six, seven, eight.  I'd say, uh, yeah.  That's, uh, you do a little math there.  I'll go with five.  I don't want to even attempt.  What?  Five times six hundred is at least, uh, three thousand.  No, six hundred times ten, that would be six thousand.  Then you split it in half is three thousand.  That's what I said.  Oh, it is?  I'm a math guy.  Yeah?  You're a brain guy with everything else.  I should have been a mathematician.  Oh.  That's what they said in high school.  I think, uh.  When I took that test. 
[01:38:00]  I think there's a leap between figuring out six hundred times.  Not really, because you had a real tough time there, my pal.  Yeah, I know.  Uh, I think they're, I think in the middle of the night, they're stealing, they're stealing  pugs and beagles from apartments.  Ooh.  Pugs and beagles.  Watch.  You're absolutely right.  Is your beagle safe?  Beagles and pugs being taken from your home?  Yeah.  Yeah.  We're predicting the future right now.  Yeah.  This is what you're going to hear.  Just wait for that news tease.  Absolutely. 
[01:38:30]  Pugs and beagles are going to be taken.  The news will take this cute phenomenon that is the puggle.  Yeah.  And they'll make a disaster out of it somehow.  They'll make it scary.  That's right.  Dangerous.  That's right.  That's right.  Start taping the news.  Lots of children getting puggles this holiday season.  Is there a danger?  We'll let you know.  The hidden danger in the puggle.  Actually, puggles on the Today Show pros and cons.  Pros and cons.  So is getting a mixed breed really a good idea? 
[01:39:00]  New York veterinarian Kim Rosenthal says hybrid pooches have some advantages.  I absolutely love the idea of mixing breeds.  I think that we can really look for the best characteristics in each breed and start to eliminate  some of the medical problems that have been plaguing us for a very long time.  Of course, this new wave of dog breeding has some purists snarling.  And critics fear that the fast-growing trend may lead to overzealous breeding.  But for now, Sherry is enjoying her little guy.  He's like, you know, like a best friend, like a little kid. 
[01:39:30]  And he's great.  He's great to play with and to snuggle with and just to keep me company.  And they called it puppy love.  Pug-a-love.  Ask them if they want to help save this country from the onslaught of integration.  You know, the system is they want to throw white children and colored children into the  building part of integration.  Through out of which will come a conglomerated, the latter, Mongol class of people. 
[01:40:00]  Those races will be destroyed in such a moment.  I, for one, under God will die before I yield one inch.  In that kind of a moment, what about it?  Hello, exactly.  Hello, exactly.  They're destroying the puggles.  No, the pugs.  The pugs.  And the beagles.  And the beagles.  And the pugs, if you're caught with a beagle, they start calling you a beagle lover.  Don't bring no beagle home, honey.  Brought a beagle home.  Wow.  We just look at animals differently, don't we? 
[01:40:30]  Yes.  Absolutely.  But you will be seeing the horror stories that come out.  Of course.  Because the news cannot leave it as a cutesy little story, can it?  Of course.  Every time the puggle sneezes, there's some kind of a chemical thing where it just sprays HIV all  over the room.  All right.  The puggle flew.  We guys gotta wake the fuck up!  Hey, kids.  It's Opie and Anthony's Funhouse.  Hold on tight, kids.  Strap in, kids.  Starring Opie. 
[01:41:00]  He is handsome.  Anthony.  He's got a huge hog.  And Lil Jimmy Norton.  What a faggot.  What a dick.  We're gonna have all kinds of fun today, kids.  Ugh.  Tell him, Opie.

Apparently, that guy that they found that blood streak, and he was missing, and they still haven't solved it. 
[01:45:00]  His wife.  For a while back, you'd think it was a wife and a couple of Russian guys.  They cleared her, though, man.  Yeah, there was a couple of Russian guys involved, and there was drinking and some gambling.  I don't know.  Things just happened, and no one knows what it is.  So now they're trying to figure out a way to keep people from missing.  But apparently, he's not the only guy.  Like, this is now a news story where they're scaring people.  I want to know how many fucking people.  Have you ever been on a cruise ship?  Oh, I love it.  Dude, how can you not ever not be missing? 
[01:45:30]  If you ever walked on the edge of that platform and just, like, said, you know what?  Let me just jump.  Like, it's just like you just feel that.  I think we're talking about just that you feel the mermaid or whatever.  You know what that is.  It's the fucking siren.  That siren.  And I heard it.  I wanted to jump off because the sea is so dominant over your life at that moment.  You just want to just go in there and do the Titanic sink just to see what the abyss is all about.  And it's easy to be missing on these boats. 
[01:46:00]  Yeah.  But you think it's suicide?  You think it's people jumping?  I think I'm a strong-minded person because I get a lot of thoughts in my head that I control without medicine.  You know what I'm saying?  I can control violence.  Thank God.  I can control, you know, suicide.  Those thoughts creep in when you're just sitting around like, you know, what the fuck is life all about?  Let me just smash my face into a bus, right?  Just, you know, or kill a motherfucker just to see. 
[01:46:30]  Right.  Just to see.  But I have a natural medicine, you know, that I can muster up in my home.  But when I was on the ship, I was standing on the edge.  I was doing something, I think, for Comedy Central or something.  I was just standing on the end of that boat.  And the darkness and the water swishing.  Yeah.  I know what those sailors back in, you know, 01, you know, the Christopher Columbus motherfuckers killed themselves.  There's something calling you to jump in and kill yourself. 
[01:47:00]  Especially back then when there was no, you know, tuxedo night at the dining room.  That's why they had that stuff to take your mind off of killing yourself.  Is that what, all the good stuff, the casino, the shows, the stop at the port so you could go to the beach and see some land.  It's, they know that.  Because if they just leave you out there long enough without any distractions, everyone's jumping overboard.  Paranoia.  I know there's some maritime documents somewhere.  Yeah.  From 1601.  Some oldie time written with a quill, like on brown curled up paper somewhere. 
[01:47:30]  Like in the movie, The Thing, where they find the Russian ship that all the Russians fought the monster.  And there's the one last survivor who has a tape.  And he's like, listen, don't, ah, ah, ah.  And they have things like that from when people used to do all those, that there's something calling me into the water.  Into the air water.  And it's true, man.  I wanted to, it's the weirdest thing.  And that's where these missing people on the cruise ships are.  And we got to get the audio because I was just watching it.  They just showed a montage of guys that are missing. 
[01:48:00]  A whole freaking montage, one after another.  Let's go to Jason in Maryland.  Jason, what's up?  Not too much.  What's up with you guys this morning?  We're all over the place.  Hanging.  We got lots to do.  Obviously.  The reason I was calling is you guys were talking about the missing guy on that cruise ship.  Yeah.  With the bloodstain and the Russian mafia and all that shit.  Uh-huh.  I was on that ship.  That guy didn't, he did not commit suicide.  That's for goddamn sure.  How do you know?  Were you hanging out with him at the buffet?  No, I wasn't hanging out with him at the buffet. 
[01:48:30]  But I saw the blood.  And I'm telling you, from the height where that guy's room was to that bloodstain,  there's no way just falling could create that amount of blood.  I was on the same ship before it went over to the Mediterranean.  Oh, yeah?  Where this guy was.  Yeah, they were.  And they were talking about how the ship was going from the Caribbean, where I was,  uh, and that it was going to be dry docked, refitted with some shit, and then they were  going to send it over to the Mediterranean, and that's the cruise that the guy died on.  Uh, so I, I know what it looks like off of those upper balconies. 
[01:49:00]  And, uh, yeah, there's no way to get, to jump to the water from up there.  You're hitting that overhang that hangs over the lifeboat.  Exactly.  And that seems to be where that big blood smear came from.  Uh, he, he might have jumped, but I think there's too many things that are going on.  Those Russian guys, uh.  And they were everywhere.  That seems to be a little sketchy there.  Two Russian guys, the woman, the casino, kind of an argument.  They're not going to solve this one.  Yelling, yelling, and then the shit in the room was just yelling. 
[01:49:30]  She goes to sleep, he disappears.  I don't know.  You think he jumped, though, Patrice?  I don't know.  Nah.  This is some foul play.  Definitely some foul play.  You ought to put something on those ships where you can detect when someone goes in the water.  What the fuck?  God.  Get some night vision in the water.  You're done if you fall in that ocean in the middle of that damn Atlantic or wherever you are.  It's just, once you're in there, it's been a pleasure. 
[01:50:00]  There is such nothingness out there that you, I couldn't imagine.  If you don't die the second you hit that water, could you imagine bobbing up and down and watching that huge ship just pull away from you?  And the darkness and the utter quiet.  Like, you'd hear that ship go away.  And then, and then you're just, and it is so completely dark. 
[01:50:30]  And you don't hear, you don't even hear that, what's that, buoy bell?  No.  Ding, ding.  Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.  A couple of, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.  Nothing.  Because they have nowhere to land out there.  Even with the motor going.  Do you cry?  Do you cry?  Like, do you, is your flow in there?  Do you just decide?  I think the fear just kills you.  Just take a deep breath.  I don't know.  The fear just kills you.  It depends on if you could try to commit suicide or if you fell off.  You fell off, you are so fucked now. 
[01:51:00]  You're like, oh, no.  And there's no help.  And that horse shit you see on Love Boat when somebody falls off and there's a lifesaver flying.  Yeah, Julie, the cruise director, throws you a fucking life preserver.  Man overboard.  There's no fucking man.  If I jumped over when the sirens were calling me on that ship, it would have just been a plunk.  Yeah.  That nobody except for somebody that was thinking about killing themselves, too, saw me jump.  Look at that.  Oh, shit.  I ain't doing this shit. 
[01:51:30]  No!  It's not welcome to jump off the boat.  If you meant to kill yourself, you still got your crazy head on, so you're probably going to just try to drown, whatever.  If you fell overboard, I think the first thing that goes through your head is, what time is it?  Who knows?  Like, in a split second, what time is it?  Who knows I'm missing?  How long is it going to take for people to think?  As that thing is just going away, you're probably thinking,  how long is it going to be before they realize I'm missing and turn this thing around? 
[01:52:00]  They're not going to turn that cruise ship around for you?  No.  That is collateral damage, bitch.  They'll just call the Coast Guard.  Well, our fuel supply just lets us get into a...  We've got a tight schedule.  Fuck.  And you've got to find them in the ocean.  Yeah.  Yeah, right.  And you've got to get coordinates of where you might be.  Oh, done.  And then where you floated because all this...  They should hand out little GPS badges to everybody in that case.  Now, that's an idea.  There's an idea.  A little GPS.  We've got the audio of the story here. 
[01:52:30]  You know, once you board a cruise ship, you really are in the hands of the cruise ship company.  Whoops.  But if something goes wrong, what happens?  Who's responsible?  Well, that is the subject of that special hearing on Capitol Hill this afternoon.  I can't talk.  And it comes just days after another cruise ship passenger has disappeared.  When Royal Caribbean's Jewel of the Seas returned to Florida on Sunday...  Another Royal Caribbean.  ...we had one less passenger than when it departed.  A Canadian, 59-year-old Jill Begora, was last seen by her husband on Saturday morning 
[01:53:00]  as the ship approached the port of Nassau in the Bahamas.  A search by a U.S. Coast Guard ship and the Bahamian Navy found no trace of her.  Bahamian Navy.  Her family just wants to know what happened.  It's just too much to comprehend, you know.  I hope everything's all right, but, you know, all those things are sometimes.  You hope everything's all right.  Are you?  Insane.  You're hoping everything...  Like she's going to turn up. 
[01:53:30]  Oh, I was just taking a swim.  Yeah.  I like swimming.  Then you just ask a question, like, what's the percentage of when people are missing on  these boats?  What's the percentage that you find them about?  That actually come back and...  0.0001.  They might have found one.  Can you please find one?  Some got lost in the place where they keep, like, the vegetables way in the hold.  Somewhere in the bilge.  It's Tom Hanks.  I was looking for the pool deck. 
[01:54:00]  And I ended up down here where the fucking...  Some ass that forgot to take his medicine ends up in a meat locker somewhere.  Somewhere locked in a meat locker.  They never find you.  That chick, man.  That was probably a bad marriage and the guy figured out a way to get out of it.  Oh, you think?  Because that's probably it.  Either you're killing yourself or someone is killing you.  There's got to be people that plan it out and go, look, we'll be on a cruise ship.  Yeah.  A little slight push and I'm good.  A little drink, maybe slip her a little Mickey, and then give her the heave-ho. 
[01:54:30]  They'll never find her to do toxicology.  What goes through your mind to give your loved one, because there was a time you loved this  person.  What goes through your head as you're giving her the heave-ho?  Not even the heave-ho.  What goes through your mind when you're...  Because you're already committed at the heave-ho.  Right.  What goes through your mind when you're like, honey, we're going on a cruise, and you hold  the tickets up knowing I'm going to kill this fucking bitch.  The ticket wave.  Yeah.  The ticket wave.  You got both of them in your hand. 
[01:55:00]  You're waving them like a fan.  Baby, we're going on a cruise.  And you know it's going to end with a heave-ho.  The heave-ho is somewhere in that itinerary.  Do you talk about the...  We got Nassau.  Right.  All right.  And then we're going to St. Martin.  Right.  And then heave-ho.  Right.  Between Miami and Nassau, I'm doing the heave-ho.  Heave-ho.  And do you make sure she wears a special outfit so you can hold on to the outfit better to  give yourself some leverage?  I think nude.  I think you got to plan where your room is. 
[01:55:30]  You want your room at the back of the ship.  Right?  Buy the bitch a rock coat from Jamaica.  This the new rock coat, man.  It's made of stone.  It's made of stone.  Zipped the rock coat and threw her overboard.  He threw this rock coat on, man.  You want to buy a beautiful rock coat? 
[01:56:00]  We'll braid her hair with some big stones.  This is a big stone, man, yo.  Get down.  Did you get her the stone flip-flops too, man?  Some fucking Jamaican knows the deal.  Oh, here's the rock coat.  Here's the song that's playing as you're heave-hoeing.  All right?  People dancing on the upper deck.  You bump the bitch on right in the conga line?  Come on, everybody.  Do-do-do-do-do-do.  Woo!  Come on one more time around the promenade. 
[01:56:30]  Oh, God.  Sink like a rock, rock, rock.  We got rock, rock coats.  Come on, everybody.  All right.  I'm going to try this.  So this is what's going on on the deck.  Right.  You do the heave-ho.  Yeah.  Do you have a splash, Anthony?  Oh, God.  You're getting ready for the heave-ho, and everyone's having a good time upstairs. 
[01:57:00]  Hold on.  So then you do the heave-ho.  First, you've got to get rid of her.  Crack her on the head.  All right.  You knocked her on the head.  But she's complaining.  Then the splash.  Oh, that was the splash?  Yeah.  You got it.  All right.  Here we go.  All right.  All right.  And that's what she hears.  Feeling hot, hot, hot. 
[01:57:30]  Feeling hot, hot, hot.  It's a fucking boat.  Oh, I found a friend.  It goes through your mind.  Oh, no.  And then reality sinks in, and it's over.  That's the boat.  The boat's sailing away.  The boat's sailing away.  That's the last thing you hear from civilization is fucking feeling hot, hot, hot, hot. 
[01:58:00]  Oh, that whole ocean would be green from my yellow piss in that blue water.  Oh, done.  I just would die.  Done.  All right.  Here we go.  Here's more audio of passengers disappearing.  It is estimated that about a dozen people have disappeared on cruises in the last two years.  A dozen?  Legally, it is a murky area because the ships fly foreign flags.  And so this afternoon, Congress will convene a special hearing into crimes and disappearances  aboard cruise ships.  The bottom line is we are suspicious, candidly, that there's some huge problems in the cruise 
[01:58:30]  line industry.  And we think that people are not aware of some of the challenges and some of the potential  problems they may encounter.  It's not a huge problem for the cruise industry.  There are people out there that have figured out how to off their...  Off a loved one.  Loved ones.  A problem person.  And yeah, like I said, you got to be on the back of the boat, one of the lower balconies.  So that way, no one is going to see the body floating by once they're off the back of the 
[01:59:00]  boat.  Nobody's going to anywhere.  You said you've been on a cruise.  Oh, yeah.  You've been on a cruise, Opie?  Oh, yeah.  There's no place anywhere in the boat that you can't die and somebody will see you.  You don't need a special plan for this.  You just toss them off anywhere by the boat, anywhere, falling.  There's nobody to hear you.  It's a giant mall.  That's what the fuck...  Yeah.  It's not even something you enjoy to see. 
[01:59:30]  It's not even the ocean.  And you would do it late at night while everyone else is pretty much back in their rooms.  Yes.  Snoozing.  Three in the morning.  Where is with when this guy disappeared?  You're going for a late walk, by the way.  Quick, easy murder of your wife on the boat.  Ready?  This is so romantic.  Look at the stars.  We don't get to see those kind of stars in New York, do we, sweetie?  Oh, my God.  All the building light.  Look at...  Wow, I think that one's Jupiter.  Come here, bitch.  Let's go to Peter.  Peter!  Yeah. 
[02:00:00]  What's up, Peter?  So, the real question I have is, if you're taking a cruise out to Nassau, do you throw  her off the boat before or after you get there?  Yeah, I got...  Hmm.  Well, if you want to enjoy the beach, I would say after, because it's hard to throw her off  and look convincingly sad if you're then on the beach hanging with some chicks and an  umbrella drink.  Right.  I just lost my wife.  I can't find her, but I paid for the fucking cruise. 
[02:00:30]  Right.  I might as well have a dirty banana and, you know, I'm going to have a few rum drinks and  some pina coladas for everybody.  Get my hair braided.  Like a rum swizzle right after throwing the bitch overboard.  All right.  I'm buying.  The fucking rock coat is killing me, Patrice.  Get your rock coat.  Get your rock coat, man.  And these goofy motherfuckers are buying.  Oh, that rock coat.  Wow.  That rock coat is great.  You got a guy on the Coast Guard.  Made of rock, you know.  Bill, what's up?  Good morning, guys.  Hey.  My last duty station was in Sandy Hook, New Jersey. 
[02:01:00]  Their area of responsibility was lower New York Harbor.  And we were out looking for a guy that fell off a Russian trader.  I'll tell you, man, there's no fucking way you're going to find somebody out there if  they don't have a strobe light or anything with them.  Yeah.  Plus, we used to do live man overboard drills.  We used to actually jump off the boat at nighttime with our strobe lights.  Wow.  You want to talk about fucking scary?  And this is a training drill where they know you're jumping.  They're looking for you.  You have a strobe. 
[02:01:30]  And they still can't find you because the waves are bobbing up and down.  All of a sudden, that strobe disappears and then comes back because he's bobbing in the  waves.  What's the official can't find them time?  Like, what's the official we did what we could time?  Yeah.  He just fucking looked for him.  He just looked for him until he told you to stop.  Are you kidding me?  These Coast Guard guys, they just make one big circle and, like, look at their watches.  Nah, we know this guy's gone.  And what's your call?  Like, yo!  Yo!  All right, wrap it up.  Woo-hoo!  You there! 
[02:02:00]  Hello!  I bet they're a little more tactful.  I bet it's like...  Uh...  Bravo, we're running a little low on fuel.  We're going to be bringing it back.  Uh...  Yeah.  No, it's...  I don't know.  It's burning like crazy, the fuel.  I think we got a problem because, uh...  The gate says a half attack, but I'm sure we have less.  We're going back.  This motherfucker is so drowned. 
[02:02:30]  So...  Oh, the...  Oh, the mic is still keyed.  Sorry.  I can't...  You can't...  It's just, you know, who you fooling?  It is what it is.  You can't be mad about it.  It's the ocean.  I'm...  It's the...  It's unbelievable, man.  It's just so dark.  And so...  And how deep is the deepest part of the Atlantic?  What, a thousand feet or something?  A thousand?  A mile deep?  You're talking...  After...  After ten feet, who cares?  Hey, what's that?  What, you've never seen it before?  It looks like a rock.  New from Sedentary Toys and The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[02:03:00]  Oh, it's so shiny.  It's got corners.  It's the cool new toy that has everyone jumping for joy.  O&A Party Rock!  It's not just any rock.  It's the O&A Party Rock!  The O&A Party Rock is incredibly versatile.  You can chuck it.  You can fuck it.  You can drop it in a bucket.  You can race it.  You can chase it.  You can yell right in its face.  It's the bestest friend you'll ever have.  O&A Party Rock!  Why is it wearing a party hat?  Every Party Rock comes dressed in a colorful party hat and party blower, making it the  centerpiece of any party. 
[02:03:30]  Now with shiny red dancing shoes.  Not only that, the O&A Party Rock is...  Is...  Is...  It's a fucking rock, you dildo.  60 seconds with 21-31.  When I think about the streak, I think about all the games I ever played in.  I came to the ballpark every day with a desire to play.  My father taught me to put myself in the hands of the manager as he decides who will play each  day to win the game.  The streak was a collection of individual days that I was selected.  And before long, there was the streak. 
[02:04:00]  I am proud of the fact that my managers felt I was worthy to be in the lineup day after day.  I never set out to break Lou Gehrig's record, but I am proud to be tied to one of the greatest  players in baseball history.  What began on May 30th, 1982, and continues September 6th, 1995, this game with the Angels  trailing is now in the books.

Hey, Anthony, we've got to get Steve in here.  He's working on our coming or going game.  Uh-huh.  Steve, how's the coming or going game going? 
[02:07:00]  Hands tucked in up to the nipples.  Coming.  Jesus, Steve.  Pull the shirt out.  It's a medium.  God.  He's a tuck kind of guy.  Stop tucking.  That looks so much better untucked, little v-neck.  I-  Stop tucking.  Nothing I do.  That looks good.  No, no.  Everything I do, everything I wear.  Back off the mic a little bit.  I like that.  I like that.  That's the loose guy.  Yeah, much better.  You're making us all very uncomfortable.  You really like to tuck that shirt all the way in.  It's like you're Lebanese.  What are you hiding, a bomb belt?  We should make a shirt up for him that says, go tuck yourself. 
[02:07:30]  Good-natured shirt.  Don't I tell you to tuck your mud up.  At least he's-  Boom, bang.  At least he doesn't have any flames on his attire today.  I bet you his boxers do.  He sent me an email yesterday.  He got all excited because on eBay they're selling boots with flames.  Yeah.  And you want to make a bid on those, don't you?  Not, Henry.  I'm trying to tuck this broad.  Here's a little help here.  True broad.  God, it doesn't like big, thick Lebanese fingers. 
[02:08:00]  Every day.  It never gets old.  You got big tattooed tucker?  All right, so how's the coming or going game going?  It's going well.  You think we'll do it today?  No, we won't do it today.  I actually have a good stash at home that I have to pull for three.  Oh, wow.  All right.  No, it's got to be good.  That means we're going to have to find more stuff.  As I'm doing this, are we going to have it on Skull Shirt Day or Flame Shirt Day?  Okay, Flame Shirt Day.  But you know what?  Even Skull and Flame Shirt Day are roll up the edge of the shirt sleeve and iron it day. 
[02:08:30]  Is there any reason?  Is there any reason?  I wish people in Radioland could see the fact that this sociopath is wearing a black t-shirt  and he rolls up the part of the edge of the black sleeve and then irons it so there's  like a little cuff on the t-shirt sleeve.  That's to show off those big bicep.  Look at how size it is.  I spent months to get my arms tattooed.  Why not show them off?  I know, but you only do it a quarter inch.  Just roll.  Just get a tank top.  Show off the arms.  He probably measures it with a tape measure.  You know why? 
[02:09:00]  Because I walk in here with a tank top and it's more ammunition for you to take.  I wouldn't make fun of your tank top.  That's true.  Yeah.  Right.  You know the pressure now every day.  He probably wakes up and looks at the shirts and goes, no, I can't even do it.  I'm going to catch up with this one.  If I cared enough what Jim thought.  You know, do you realize the irony in me taking wardrobe criticism from you?  Ah, good.  Now you've got to give him credit for that one.  And I can't even argue with it.  I'm an awful dresser.  Yes.  But I'm acknowledging I'm an awful dresser.  But see, yeah, Norton's not trying though.  He doesn't care. 
[02:09:30]  It seems like you've got something going on here.  I've got a look going.  You're trying for a look.  You really are trying for a look.  I don't care what Jim thinks of my look.  But how does it feel that when you pull into a gas station, people run?  I don't even know what that meant.  Because there's flames.  I got it.  Yeah, of course you did.  I carried the two.  I did the math problem.  That was good.  All right.  Just wait until you see the boots.  Are you really going to get the boots? 
[02:10:00]  I already got them.  Not the ones I showed you last night.  They didn't have those on my side.  You've got to come in to work with the flaming boots.  When are you moving to Chelsea, by the way?  They're shipped in from England.  He needs a roadster.  He's the kind of guy that would drive a roadster with the flames on it.  The look is perfect to get out of that.  We've got to get him on American Chopper.  Yeah, yeah.  You're perfect for American Chopper.  He's the type of guy you see holding hands with another guy, but not in one of those hardcore male fist clubs.  Oh, wow.  I didn't see that coming.  The type of guys that shake hands like this. 
[02:10:30]  How you doing?  And then kiss deep in the middle of the street.  Oh.  I'm not knocking them.  I'm just saying that those, you ever see those guys, like those, those are the gay guys that you don't like.  Yeah, Anthony and I see those guys all the time.  What?  Yeah, yeah.  Where the fuck did you get that from?  You never saw the guys, the leather bar guys?  Only in that movie that Pacino was in, Cruisin'.  Oh, that was, yeah.  He wears the yellow handkerchief.  Yeah.  Nah, just like watching.  You'd never get a laugh when we'd come out of BCN, when we'd be broadcasting at BCN at the Ramrod.  All right, the Ramrod's across the street.  Yeah, the Ramrod type of guy. 
[02:11:00]  Yeah.  Hey, hey, thank God the Ramrod was there.  I'm sure Perenna loved that when he was working at BCN.  Hey, he's right across the street.  Of course, they're a little too old for my liking.  Any PlayStation takers here?  Gotta love him.  What's up?  This is Joe Rogan, and you are listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Anthony?  Yes.  What did your brother get you for Christmas?  I stopped you.  All right.  I'm sorry.  Yes, a wonderful gift for me.  It's the perfect present.  I'm going to start my collection.  Gloves that no germs can go through? 
[02:11:30]  No, that would be good, though.  That would really be good.  He got me an old World War II English rifle.  It's wonderful.  It's 1938.  Just a Kraut killer, complete with a bayonet.  It's an Enfield.  Very nice.  And the thing is so heavy.  It's made of wood, and it's got like a butt plate with metal on it  that is just made for smashing Nazi teeth in with. 
[02:12:00]  Great action on it, and it's a collector's item, but could still fire it.  And now I'm looking to pick up a German Mauser from the same era  and an M1 Garand, the American, you know, World War II thing.  You could display it all nice, right?  To display, and then when I get my pistol license, which I'm going for,  I've got about a four-month wait, then I could start the pistol collection. 
[02:12:30]  It's going to be wonderful.  You're turning into one of those guys.  I am one of those guys, because let me tell you another gift I got that I will cherish.  My uncle got me one of the banners, flags, that the SS used to have on the front of their staff cars.  It's got the skull and the lightning bolts on it.  Wonderful.  I just love the era.  I love that whole World War II era. 
[02:13:00]  You're telling yourself that's what it is you love.  I like the memorabilia from it.  I like the weapons.  I like the clothing.  That's great stuff.  Just say it.  The ideology.  You'll love the ideology.  It's also obvious.  I love the clothing.  I love the weapons.  I love the message.  Yeah, it's also obvious what you hate.  It's also obvious what you hate at this point.  I didn't say anything about that.  Just because I appreciate the era and the weaponry, and the German army was very snazzy, snappy dressers. 
[02:13:30]  And I happened to pick up a leather coat that is very similar to an officer's jacket.  They photoshopped it with some patches on the sleeves that looked very bad.  Do you know you're just going to wake up one night and walk out and just see you at 3 in the morning in the living room in the dark shadows, dressed like a Nazi, looking at yourself in the mirror.  And she's going to go, what are you doing?  And you're going to go, I don't know.  Can you help me?  You're fucking losing your mind.  Gunna. 
[02:14:00]  Did you say gunna?  I don't know.  Can you help me?  Can you help me?  All right, listen.  I am the furthest thing from an Aryan.  Yeah, sure.  You're losing your mind, Anthony.  It's frightening.  It's great, though.  All guns.  We'll ride it to the end, though, man.  We'll be doing a show.  He's not even going to know where he is anymore, but we'll continue.  He'll be fucking barricaded inside his fucking house, firing at police officers, yelling, germ pigs, germ pigs. 
[02:14:30]  In between doing radio, that's what he's going to be doing during the commercials.  He's not even going to come into the studio anymore.  He's going to be one of those radio guys that has to do the show from home.  How could anyone not appreciate it?  For what reason, we don't know, but we just go with it.  How could anyone not appreciate the era, what was going on back then, the weaponry, the collector's items of World War II?  That's what I am attracted to.  This Enfield rifle, there's a history there.  I picked it up. 
[02:15:00]  I put it to my shoulder and looked down the site, and I was like, what was seen through this site over the years, you know, back in 1939, 1940, you know?  Get yourself a look at glass.  Why don't you get yourself a telescope and look at the stars and say, I wonder if anybody looked at the stars in the 40s.  Why don't you get yourself a book in that era?  Get a kaleidoscope.  Get a kaleidoscope.  That's a lot safer for everyone.  When I snapped that bayonet on, I was thinking, did anyone get run through with this thing? 
[02:15:30]  Was it used on some Nazi somewhere?  How about baseball cards?  Why don't you collect them?  I did as a kid.  As I grow, my tastes in collectibles changed, and now it is World War II memorabilia.  I want a German Mauser.  I want an M1 Garand rifle, and then perhaps I'll delve into things like the old grease gun.  Yeah, the grease gun. 
[02:16:00]  What a noodle.  Nutsy.  Let's go to Nate in Brooklyn.  Nate.  Hey, come on, Dave.  Hi, Nate.  Hey, Anthony.  I was wondering, have you ever been in an Army Navy store where the guy offered you a can of Zyklon B and then said, hey, you and me, we're really the same?  I'm just like you, man.  Just like you, man.  You and me.  No.  I'm a chef from Apocalypse Now, right, in Falling Down.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  No.  Take care, guys.  See, anyone who appreciates that kind of thing gets kind of labeled, you know? 
[02:16:30]  You get kind of labeled.  I, do you know that authentic Nazi flags are really amazingly well-made things?  It's not just a flag like with printing on it.  They're wonderfully embroidered things.  I don't own any.  I'm saying that right now.  I don't own Nazi flags.  I don't have the swastika and the eagle and the iron cross.  I own none of that.  But I've seen them in museums. 
[02:17:00]  And, you know, they're very, it's just a thing from that era that is wonderful to look at.  Way to take lemons and make lemonade.  Tell you one thing, six million dead, but, you know, all kidding aside, good craftsmen.  I mean, they, what a high thread count, that flag head.  I am not downplaying the atrocities that took place during that era by many people, the Japanese, the Nazis. 
[02:17:30]  Our own internment of the Japanese civilians was looked at as an atrocity.  Sure.  I just see it as, hey, who knows what these people are up to.  Perhaps they ought to be watched.  Absolutely.  Let's go to Rob on Long Island.  Rob, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey, Rob.  Yeah, Anthony sounds like he's about to turn in that guy from falling down.  He's going to lead like Opie into the basement.  Hey, me and you, we're the same guy.  No, I'm not that guy.  Punch it out, guys. 
[02:18:00]  Everybody hurts.  You fuckers.  Leave my car parked on the expressway.  Just walk away.  Just going to stop driving one day and just start walking.  Just start walking.  Why can't that be appreciated?  Why can't the German army's materials be appreciated without the ideology even coming up?  I deplore what they stood for, their actions against the Jewish people and many others. 
[02:18:30]  I look down upon them.  That is an awful atrocity that was committed against many people,  and nothing can ever make that a good thing.  But I like their clothes.  Sure, I'm glad you're saying that after you drop a tear watching Downfall.  You know when Hitler had to kill his dog?  For those who didn't see Downfall, it was about Hitler in the bunker,  and Anthony admitted dropping a tear for the old guy.  I never dropped a tear.  It just, for some reason, and I commented on that movie Downfall and said I didn't necessarily think this was a good thing. 
[02:19:00]  The movie was a German-made movie.  Yes.  It's got German, it's subtitled.  You've got to watch it in the actual German.  Don't watch it dubbed or anything.  No, of course not.  You can watch it in its native German tongue, and it's subtitled.  And it almost humanizes the man, you know?  You see him testing out the cyanide capsules that he's going to be using, and Ava is going to be using. 
[02:19:30]  He's got to kill his dogs, so he uses it on his dog.  And as he crunches the little snout of his German Shepherd down on the cyanide, and the dog lets out a little yelp and dies, Hitler's a little broken up about it.  And you look, and it humanizes that guy.  And I said that it's not necessarily a good thing.  Yeah, but then explain this.  When you were watching, you were thrown out of the theater, I remember, when you were watching Schindler's List for jumping up and yelling,  Goddamn meddler!  What's the matter with you?  You meddlers. 
[02:20:00]  Wow.  Hey, why don't we talk about Pat from Anarchy?  I don't understand.  See, this is why you can't be a collector.  Collect nice things.  Yeah, exactly.  How about match...  My father used to collect...  How about you...  How about you collect hummels?  Hummels?  Do you know where they come from?  I don't know.  Where do they come from?  It's not like I have a lampshade collection at home.  I don't.  My father used to collect Lionel trains. 
[02:20:30]  That's a nice thing to collect when you're a lad.  Exactly.  How about some matchbox cars?  You make good money.  There's some older, valuable ones.  What's your favorite animal?  I have...  Animal?  Yeah.  Not really a fan of the...  Besides the eagle on that flag.  The eagle is very...  You know how people have a favorite animal and then their whole house is taken over by animal things?  No.  Like my mom has...  Oh, somebody likes...  If they like pigs...  My mom...  What?  You nailed it.  My mom likes pigs, so there's a lot of pigs.  Pigs, banks, ceramic... 
[02:21:00]  It's all about the pigs.  And when she gets a new pig, is it like a big thing?  Of course it is.  Like, look what I found.  This is a 1953 steel bank pig.  That's right.  No.  My father likes unicorns.  Oh, right.  So there must be a lot of unicorns around the house.  I was just kidding.  I just wanted to say something really awful.  I like World War II memorabilia.  I like Jap stuff.  German stuff.  I like Nazi memorabilia.  I like American World War II memorabilia. 
[02:21:30]  I like their gear.  I like an old World War II field radio.  That's another thing I'm looking for my collection.  Things like that.  It's not just like sitting around with a big Nazi flag on the wall, shaving my head, wearing  Doc Martens, looking to stomp some faggots.  Those are for the weekends.  From O&A Pictures comes a true story of one man's pain.  It does hurt.  And a family torn apart. 
[02:22:00]  And it makes you feel really funny right after it happens.  The War of the Kumias.  I had the yelling parents, too, growing up until they got divorced.  And it was just, you know.  And then you'd see, like, the old man would take the plate full of spaghetti and throw it.  And it would hit, like, the wall next to the phone.  And you're sitting there horrified, watching the spaghetti slowly go down the wall.  Oh, the horrified kids.  Did Dad actually leave after the fights?  Yeah, a lot of times, sure.  And then, you know, you'd be able to go to sleep because the yelling would stop. 
[02:22:30]  First, Mom would have to wind down a little.  That fucking asshole.  You know, even after Dad left, she's still going.  Eat that shit like I need a fucking hole in the head.  I'm trying to sleep.  He's gone.  Son of a bitch.  Shut up.  He comes in here.  Shut up.  That way.  That's it.  Oh, God.  He's been gone a half hour.  When will he come back?  The next day?  Yeah, like the next day.  You know, they'd be sitting down watching, like, Ronan Martin's laughing.  Laughing.  Everything was fine.  You know?  And then out of nowhere, you'd hear the rumbling.  You'd be in bed and you'd be like... 
[02:23:00]  And then you'd hear from the kids' room.  And then we were pretty young, so, you know, we got, you know, called into the room and  Mom sits down and goes, me and your father, I want you to know, and I want you to know  it has nothing to do with you, we're divorced.  Oh, okay.  Could I go out and play now?  How is this going to change my life? 
[02:23:30]  Does this mean I don't have to listen to...  Oh, it does?  Okay.  So it's a good thing.  Great.  Well, thank you for staying together for so long and really, like, torturing us.  You couldn't have pulled this one, like, five years ago?  Yeah, fucking asshole.  Well, maybe we couldn't remember as much and didn't have to listen to the yelling and screaming.  Don't worry.  That's it.  Here's an idea, Pop.  There you go.  Right back into the Huntington boat ramp.  Give that a whirl. 
[02:24:00]  The War of the Cumhias.  You've got to figure you're going to just sit there disgusted having to listen to this crap.  This weekend, for the first time in Toyota history, an unprecedented sale will change everything.  What if we told you to get any new car, truck, or SUV, all you needed was $99 down and $99 a month?  I'd say you were full of shit.  Well, we're not.  Get ready for the no shit sale from Toyota.  No shit.  No shit.  No shit.  Toby Hines, fearless leader at Gulf States, Toyota has gone completely apeshit and authorized us to sell you any car, truck, or SUV for a ridiculously low $99 down and $99 a month. 
[02:24:30]  No shit.  No shit.  You've got to be shitting me.  Nope.  This shit is for real.  It's the no shit sale from Toyota.  $99 down, $99 a month.  But you better hurry because this shit won't be around forever.  In other words, shit or get off the pot?  Exactly.  It's the no shit sale.  $99 down and $99 a month gets you any car, truck, or SUV you want. 
[02:25:00]  Holy f***ing shit.  You said it.  See your Toyota dealer now.  Get the feeling.  Toyota.  $99 down payment, $99 monthly payment, not through Gulf States Toyota.  The no shit sale does not apply to any existing Toyota car, truck, or SUV anywhere, anyhow, anytime.  Not a limited time offer.  Don't see dealer for details.  In other words, we're full of...

Via Rail Canada just flicked the switch on a new fee-based Wi-Fi service, 
[02:29:30]  turning the stretch between Quebec City and Windsor  into a long, wireless internet corridor.  Welcome into tomorrow, I'm Dave Graveline.  By the end of the year, Canada's Via Rail is on track  to become the first North American rail carrier  to offer total onboard rolling hotspot service.  Intel's Ralph Bond tells us the magic is all made possible  by OptiFi, a Wi-Fi service provider known for their airport hotspots.  And get this, the new Wi-Fi train service 
[02:30:00]  is even an Intel Centrino Mobile Technology certified hotspot.  Now come on, why can't all trains let me surf  using my trusty Intel Centrino Mobile Technology-based laptop?  And think of all the fun travelers can have  passing the time with web music and videos.  For more information, visit viarail.ca and optify.com.  And for everything about wireless computing, visit intel.com.  I'm Dave Graveline.  The Technophile.  Hi, I'm Laszlo.  Mobile phone providers are making a lot of noise 
[02:30:30]  about their watch TV on the go services.  And of course, it costs and adds even more to your monthly bill.  In parts of Europe and Asia, they're rolling out free TV services  for mobile devices like phones and PDAs.  It's called Digital Multimedia Broadcasting, or DMB.  And the picture looks amazing.  Watching mobile television and video entertainment  is the big push for manufacturers.  And while devices like the iPod have a video screen built in,  some companies believe that the video screen  should be built into sunglasses.  We already have MP3 sunglasses, and if manufacturers have their way, 
[02:31:00]  small video screens less than an eighth of an inch  will be built into glasses as well.  With the screen that close to your eye, it looks quite large.  The plan is to, by next year, deliver video to your glasses  from an iPod or PDA wirelessly by a Bluetooth.  But do we really need to be watching movies while walking?  I'm Lazlo.  That's what's on my underground hard drive.  High Voltage is an XL channel which may include explicit language.  Channel blocking is available by calling 1-800-XM-RADIO

Good morning.  Hi.  Good morning.  What's up, Nick?  What's going on?  Nick is our friend.  I understand that.  He knows everybody around here.  He's one of the guys.  Very, very funny.  One of the successful guys.  Yeah.  Oh.  Much better than some of us. 
[02:32:00]  One of the guys who moved to L.A. and actually shit happened for him.  Oh, really?  Congratulations.  Thank you, bro.  I mean, you know, we'll see what happens.  I don't know.  I could fucking die tomorrow.  Tight to the vest.  I like that.  Hey, you never know.  You do stuff with Adam Sandler, right?  Yeah, I worked with Adam for the last couple years.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, hoo-hoo.  It's so hard for me not to do that when I run.  I'm around him.  He does not like it, but whenever I'm in the office, I'm like, love to eat turkey.  He's like, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[02:32:30]  All right.  All right.  All right.  I did that years ago.  Knock it off.  Boy, that keeps things in perspective, though.  You know, when you're feeling successful and stuff, then you look at him and it kind of  makes you feel like a piece of shit.  Yeah.  Quite frankly, if you're talking about comics being successful, he's one that kind of really-  He's the top of the top.  Yeah.  He's got to be making a million, million and a half bucks a year.  Uh, Jim could be a couple more than that.  Gag never gets old. 
[02:33:00]  Yeah, no.  He's ginormous.  He shares it with all of his good, close friends?  Yeah.  No, he's amazing.  He's like the most loyal, great guy.  He's awesome.  Really cool.  Yeah.  Good.  Have him call the show.  I will.  Yeah.  I'll throw it at him.  I will for sure.  We talked to him a few years back.  Haven't talked to him since.  Oh, way before the-  That's what I'm saying.  That's what I mean by-  It's a million dollar movie.  We always talk to these guys on their way up and then on their way down, so-  We, I think when we talked to him, uh, we talked about what was it like working with  Colin Quinn on remote control.  That's hilarious. 
[02:33:30]  And that was pretty much it.  Yeah.  And then, uh-  And then all of a sudden he had a couple movies that a lot of people saw.  Stardom.  Right.  Can I be one of his movies?  Comedy film stardom.  Yeah, we have to be awkward, like on the radio or nothing, but maybe I can be one of his-  Maybe you can be the new you-can-do-it guy.  Yes, you can.  Thanks, Nick.  That was easy.  Well, Nick, hang with us.  We'll get into some of the things you're doing, but we also have to play this yellow  brick road or people are going to kill us.  Before, before anything though, it's the new year.  I'm starting something new.  We're very charitable people here on this program. 
[02:34:00]  We are.  Nice.  And yeah.  All right.  I, and I just want, I, I've been looking for a charity and I'm serious.  Is there anybody in your family that has any mental disabilities that you would like  money given to?  Some type of-  My uncle's retarded.  Really?  But, but like, really, or-  No, seriously.  Like, he has, he has a mental problem.  My uncle's Steve.  You might want to come back another day then.  Yeah.  It's the next hour.  Wait, we have a retarded Steve here, do we?  Right.  See, what are you getting at, Anthony? 
[02:34:30]  Well, that's the whole new angle this year.  It's not making so many people uncomfortable.  Oh, I see.  Remember who was in here that day and we were going off and they didn't say a word and we  were going off about some retarded show.  Oh, that was Vinny.  Right.  Vinny Brandt.  Vinny Brandt.  How uncomfortable is that?  I like now getting these things out in the clear, so I'm going to use my charity ruse  every time.  But how did you know that he had a-  I didn't.  He wasn't supposed to.  He was supposed to go, no, I don't give a shit about fucking retards.  And then we roll and all laugh about the yellow brick road. 
[02:35:00]  But now there's going to be an uncomfortable retarded uncle.  But I didn't say that I was- I had a problem with it.  I mean, like-  Oh, you don't care?  No.  Oh, okay.  He tried to stab me at a Thanksgiving.  He tried to stab you Thanksgiving?  He tried to stab me at a Thanksgiving.  Oh, okay.  All right.  So fuck him.  He's going down.  He's going down.  Well, Anthony discovered this little thing.  Well, I saw it on Cinemax, I guess it was.  I'm not even sure.  One of those fucking things.  Maybe HBO Family.  And it was a bunch of retarded people, mentally challenged, whether they had Down Syndrome or 
[02:35:30]  something else.  I don't know.  A bunch of different types of retarded conditions.  But they all were brought together in one group to perform The Wizard of Oz.  in full costume with director and stage hands and music and everything.  Oh, God.  And I-  Wait.  I could not take my eyes off-  Yeah.  Bill might be tapping out.  I tap out on retards.  Bill taps out on retards. 
[02:36:00]  Do you really?  Yeah.  Remember-  I did a bit one time on stage and I made a woman cry.  Yeah.  And that was it for you?  Yeah, I just think I got some-  I haven't tried to have kids yet and I'm tapping out.  See?  That would have caused me to write more retarded-  That's the fucking greatest thing ever.  You know what's funny?  And his is the greatest retarded book ever.  Do you remember it?  I was making fun of that movie, I Am Sam.  I was talking about how Hollywood-  Of course we do all the time.  Yeah.  How Hollywood depicts retarded people as if they somehow accidentally have these 
[02:36:30]  unbelievable insights into life and accidentally throw out these metaphors.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  And I was like, I worked with retarded kids at no point did they ever accidentally say anything.  Right.  And lighten you.  Right.  And then you couldn't throw sticks on the ground.  They're like, hey, 62.  And then you go to Vegas.  And the punchline was if retarded people really had these skills, we wouldn't put them in those special schools.  We'd have them working in the Pentagon. 
[02:37:00]  Hey, where's the Al-Qaeda going to attack next?  Then you throw matches on the ground.  Hey, I think they're going to attack Disney World.  It was in front of like 18 people.  Who cried over that joke?  Well, she started flipping out.  And then I said, I'm not making fun of retarded kids.  I'm talking about-  Right.  Hollywood.  Yeah.  About them.  No, I was an asshole.  I should have backed off.  And then she got up and walked out.  It was like in front of 18 people.  So she gets up, like teared up and walked out.  And then it's just awkwardness.  And I'm just standing there like, yeah, okay.  And then all of a sudden her husband finally has the balls to get up. 
[02:37:30]  And then he walks out.  And then like 30 seconds later, their friend finally gets up and goes, wow.  That ain't right.  And then he fucking walks out.  No way.  Oh, it was awful.  It's like the whole crowd, like one at a time with like 30 second breaks, was just getting  up and walking out.  Everyone leave.  Worst DNA first, please.  The worst is when you get hung out to dry on something where you're pointing out some  kind of flaw in Hollywood.  Yeah.  And it's taken as you goofing on retarded people. 
[02:38:00]  How do you handle it?  Believe me, this will be goofing on retarded people.  Not your fun, insightful little joke there.  Not your clever joke.  Right.  I was working Dangerfield.  There's no real handling it.  I mean, it's not like you're going to affect your career.  You weren't yelling, well, I was just saying, people.  18 people.  Was it news, Eve?  Yeah, no.  Well, it's hard to do that and then segue into, so I got a computer.  That's what I mean.  Yeah.  Did the manager have to like give them free passes?  No, they don't care there at all. 
[02:38:30]  No, they don't.  Speaking of slow, I still have dial-up.  Speaking of things retarded people will never do, I got a computer.  Right.  Billy, can I have my retarded uncle grant you like a retarded pardon?  Yeah.  Like just out of the radio.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Now, if he's willing to hang out with the retarded uncle.  Should we do this or not?  Oh, my God.  He's got a retarded uncle.  Bill Burr wants to tap out.  No, bring it, dude.  Oh, you don't think the message boards would get that.  Did I kill another bit? 
[02:39:00]  I mean, I already fucked over that.  Okay.  No.  I did a 9-11 benefit at the Stress Factory and.  Hey, don't you fucking talk about that.  No, hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.  That we won't fucking deal with.  I'm as red, white, and blue as they come.  No, I got a.  And I did a retarded joke and it was up on these retarded message boards.  People who have retarded family.  If I find the thread, I'll bring it in.  We can print it.  But it was really.  Retarded message boards and by that you mean whackbag.com.  No.  No?  Oh, okay.  I think he's not doing good on the show.  When he comes back from A.A. 
[02:39:30]  Fucking cunts.  Not whackbag.  The other one.  I like ice cream.  No, this was about people of retarded kids.  They were really fucking upset.  And one woman actually who babies retarded kids.  All right.  I used to fool around with in my car actually defended me.  You know what?  No.  Open.  We got to do it.  Jesus.  He just crumbled up the bit.  What's wrong with everybody?  Well, we got to do it.  Do it.  Look.  I'm against it.  It's the Yellow Brick Road.  Billy.  The retarded production of Wizard of Oz.  Anthony found this.  Brought it to our attention.  Let's listen to a couple. 
[02:40:00]  See if it's even worthy of not goofing on, but discussing.  Because I'll be honest with you.  I watched a show the other day, I mentioned it, called I Have Tourette's, but Tourette's  doesn't have me.  It was a show about children, junior high school age, with Tourette's syndrome.  And I'm there sitting in, buckled in, all ready to laugh.  I'm doing a radio show.  And it wasn't, it was very touching, sensitive, done very well, nice.  And it wasn't, didn't have any comedy value.  Good cinematography. 
[02:40:30]  It was not any comedy value.  There was nothing to bring here to the show to goof on or anything.  Perhaps this is the saint.  So what you're saying is we're going to have an informed discussion about the merits of  the mentally challenged doing old movie.  Old classics.  Classics.  Retarded classics.  Retarded classics.  Absolutely.  Let's start with the first track here.  Keep an open mind.  Let's be adults.  This is the Tin Man Singing.  This is a production of Gone With My Intelligence. 
[02:41:00]  Oof, as dumb as the wind.  All right.  The Tin Man Sings, everyone.  When a man's an empty kettle, he should be on his metal.  And yet I'm torn apart.  Just because I'm presuming that I could be kind of human if I only had a heart. 
[02:41:30]  Anti-gender.  I'd be gentle and awful sentimental regarding love and heart.  I'd be friends with the sparrows and the boy who shoots the arrows if I only had a heart.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Yikes.  That was nice. 
[02:42:00]  Bill, comment?  I'm just thinking like when you're in class, when like high school, and like if you laugh,  you're going to get suspended.  This should be like the Olympics of it.  They should just put kids there and like.  Yeah, because kids would just be brutal.  Yeah.  Brutaless.  Who can hold out the fucking longest.  Yeah.  I just want to see all the parents in the audience proudly watching this.  That's my 30-year-old.  So, so far no one's laughing yet?  No, no.  No, no.  So far? 
[02:42:30]  I think he did a fine job.  Let's see who's twisted.  Fine rendition.  I think the scarecrow one's going to be the hardest.  Yeah, that could be rough.  Because he wants a brain.  Yeah.  You know what he wants.  And they all can relate.  Here's the teacher laying down the ground rules.  All right.  Everyone listen up, okay?  There's a lot of work to do.  So if every time I call somebody's name, we clap for five minutes, we're not going to  have any time.  Shh, shh, shh.  We're not going to have any time to get any work done.  That's the first thing. 
[02:43:00]  The second thing is there's all different kinds of parts with all different amounts of  lines.  But everyone will be on stage.  Everyone will have either a speaking line or a musical number.  Do we all understand that?  Yeah.  Okay.  No.  No.  You know what that was?  Wah wah wah wah wah wah wah wah wah wah wah wah wah wah wah wah wah wah wah wah.  What?  Candy candy, candy, candy, candy, candy, candy, candy.  Candy candy puppy, puppy kitty.  Candy candy, shit your pants candy, candy candy puppy. 
[02:43:30]  Oh, did you hear Bill?  Did you hear the sound he just made?  He went, he went, oh.  Oh, it's disgusting Bill Burr.  I will take it easy, you're right, you're right.  You're right, you're right.  Yeah, now that was, uh, yeah.  Uh, that was.  He's like, start at Gracie's.  Candy.  The best is that they're gonna clap for five minutes every time a name is called.  She said don't, she said don't do.  They're supportive.  They're supportive of each other. 
[02:44:00]  What was in the background?  Did you hear like that?  And then they escorted him out, I think.  Whatever it was, it wasn't the solution to a math problem.  But maybe it was and they didn't let him, you know.  He was actually yelling out something about pie and they're like, alright, shut up, stupid.  Alright, here we go.  Mom, I got the witch.  Miss Gulch.  Yes, Miss Gulch.  I got it.  I did.  I got Miss Gulch.  I got Miss Gulch.  I got Miss Gulch.  I got Miss Gulch.  Yes, Miss Gulch.  I got it.  I did.  I got Miss Gulch. 
[02:44:30]  I got Ms. Colch.  I got the witch.  Yes.  Mother retarded.  Somebody forgot that line.  Who's clapping in the background?  That's my happy.  Do you have asthma too?  I know.  I know you're happy.  It's a lot of work.  I was praying for the Ms. Colch so much. 
[02:45:00]  You know, I don't mind retards, but at least get the ones that can act.  This fucking retard has no motivation.  That wasn't part of the show.  What was that?  It was the girl that got the part of the Wicked Witch calling her mother to tell her that she had gotten the part she wanted.  Oh, all right.  So she was very emotional about the fact that she had gotten the part, and they, you know, painted her up green. 
[02:45:30]  What's my motivation?  To finally be included in a family photograph?  Hey, Jim, what's up?  What's up, fellas?  Hey, I was just wondering, can you play that version of Somewhere Over the Gene Pool?  Come on.  Sir, please.  That's mean-spirited.  I'm sorry.  All right.  This next clip, we meet the Wicked Witch.  I'm Elizabeth O'Brien, and I played the Wicked Witch of the West. 
[02:46:00]  Who killed my sister?  Who killed the Wicked Witch of the East?  Was it you?  No, I didn't mean to kill anyone.  It was an accident.  Well, my little pretty, I can cause accidents, too.  Oh, no.  Aren't you forgetting something?  It's actually better written. 
[02:46:30]  Well, there's the Wicked Witch.  Oh, yeah.  Here's a very famous line.  Oh.  You're cursed, Brad.  Look what you've done.  Oh, God.  I'm melting.  I'm melting.  Melting.  Oh, what a world.  What a world.  What could a girl like you destroy my beautiful wickedness?  Oh, my gosh. 
[02:47:00]  What'd he say?  Yeah, yeah.  You killed her.  That was the gold at the end.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That sounded like Corky.  That did sound like Corky.  A guest star, right?  A big cameo.  Yeah.  That's hilarious.  Who is, like, repeating her line?  Because that's just the witch is supposed to be saying that line.  That's the teacher probably reading her lines.  You think?  I think maybe it was Dorothy, like, not knowing she's not supposed to say that.  You ever see, like, kids in a movie sometimes or a TV show, they're actually mouthing the 
[02:47:30]  words that the other person is speaking as they're doing them?  I think that's what she was kind of doing.  You got to smack around a little.  Isn't that rehearsal, though?  Is this rehearsal still?  Yeah, this is rehearsal.  Oh, maybe.  All right.  They're rehearsing.  All right.  It'll get better.  We meet the line.  Nothing different than your show you're doing for HBO, right?  Honestly, God, Louis C.K. does actually do the lines like that sometimes in rehearsal.  I'm like, what the fuck are you doing?  So it happens.  All right.  We meet the lion here.  My name is John Stare, and I'm playing the Cowdery Lion in this play. 
[02:48:00]  Put him up.  Put him up.  That's not bad.  Which one of you first?  I'll fight you both together if you like.  I'll fight you with one paw tied behind my back.  I'll fight you standing on one foot.  I'll fight you with my eyes closed.  Oh.  Pull an axe on me, eh?  Yeah.  That's him talking to intelligent thoughts.  Smicking up on me, eh?  I didn't bite him. 
[02:48:30]  Is my nose bleeding?  You are relentless.  Of course not.  My goodness.  You're nothing but a great, big coward.  You're right.  I am a coward.  I haven't gotten courage at all.  I even scare myself.  I don't doubt that.  I'm really getting into the whole spirit of The Wizard of Oz, though.  They're doing a great job with the acting.  It isn't just like droning.  Yeah. 
[02:49:00]  It's not just nonsense.  Really putting some emotion.  All right.  Now we meet the mayor.  Bill Burr will be at Caroline's all weekend long.  He's always here for these shows.  When are you going to realize that you always have these shows?  Yeah, I know.  And you just don't notice until I come in.  Maybe you're right.  Here we go.  One time I kicked the ball in the dog's face, and I didn't even know I did it that day.  It ate his prime ribs.  Since I'm here, he did a backflip. 
[02:49:30]  Did you see that, Matt?  No.  No?  It's a workout for me.  Ah, that's a little off time, I guess.  Yeah, of course.  Joe, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, Joe.  I'm watching that show last night, and thanks to that show, my girlfriend thinks I'm the  most disgusting human being on the face of this planet.  Why?  What happened?  I laughed throughout the whole thing.  I was laughing so hard, I couldn't hardly breathe, especially after the retard at the end  was saying, just don't call me late for dinner.  Yeah, that was his big joke at the end. 
[02:50:00]  And then he stared off into space somewhere where he just was gone.  And they just fade to black and show the credits, and they just leave you hanging with  that nice little cliffhanger of him staring off into blankness.  That and the Wicked, the girl that played the Wicked Witch, remind me of Rosie O'Donnell  in that movie she did.  Yeah.  You remember the Rosie O'Donnell movie where she played the retarded woman on the bus?  Yeah.  Well, dude, it's not bad laughing through the whole thing.  Your girlfriend should have been happier that you weren't fucking her through the entire  production.  Then you're dating a psychopath.  As you're watching.  If you're banging her and she's talking, you're like, shh, I want to hear this. 
[02:50:30]  Yeah, well, the problem is my girlfriend used to work with autistic people, so I guess  she was kind of sensitive about it.  Of course.  And I kind of played it off like, oh, I really want to see this.  This sounds really interesting.  And then throughout the whole thing, I'm just freaking laughing my fucking ass off.  All right.  There's just something, like, uncomfortable, but you've got to kind of chuckle at some  of the little awkward mistakes they make.  You've got to laugh a little bit.  I mean, you know.  I'm not running up.  No, that's why.  You think if I was there, I wouldn't be laughing my ass off? 
[02:51:00]  Of course you would be.  That's the problem is because you're not allowed to.  Yeah.  If they would just let you, it wouldn't even be nearly as funny.  Right.  Maybe.  You didn't sound like that.  No, I agree with you.  I'm just saying, it's not like we're not running up to people in wheelchairs on the  street pointing and laughing in their face.  That would be fantastic, though.  After they roll by.  You're doing it very cowardly.  I am doing it very cowardly.  You're recording them.  Record, bring in, laugh, faceless microphone.  Right. 
[02:51:30]  I'll agree with that.  I've got no problem with it, either.  Let's go to Brandon in New Jersey.  Brandon.  Hey, what's going on, fellas?  You want a pistol license.  What would be wrong by the kids' moms if I only had a coat hanger?  Punch it out, boys.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Holy shit.  If I only had an HMO.  Oh.  Zag Man from Whack Bag.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey. 
[02:52:00]  I could drop this piece of jelly with a kick right to my belly.  Zag Man.  Yes, sir.  Hey.  I didn't realize Stern was playing the Cowardly Lion.  There you go.  Who?  Stern, Cowardly Lion.  Oh, who, who?  Who, who?  Who, who?  All right, let's play the next clip here.  Mayer says his one line in the play.  We grilled him on his one line and how he would say it and, um, you know, what the rhythm of 
[02:52:30]  the line would be.  And he was willing to do that, to repeat it again and again and again, to get it right,  to get it how we wanted it to be.  As mayor of the Munston City in the country.  Slope.  County.  County of the land of Oz, I welcome you most.  Regally.  Regally.  As mayor of Munston City in the county of the land of Oz, I welcome you to, I, we welcome 
[02:53:00]  you most regally.  You know it perfect.  I wanted you to know that before.  A plus.  A plus.  Perfect.  A plus.  Oh my God.  All you gotta do is not bite somebody's face.  Oh look, a star on your tongue.  Good boy.  Well, as we move on, the Tin Man and Scarecrow match wits here. 
[02:53:30]  Well, I, I just want to say that this, this is quite an honor.  And, um, I'm, I'm going to have lots of fun.  Oh, you're going to have lots of fun?  Yeah, what about?  Are you sure?  Yeah, what about you, Dan?  What, what about me?  I'm, they just gave me the roll of a, of a Scarecrow with a, have a straw in me, and I'm  going to, that's retarded Woody Allen. 
[02:54:00]  They're going to burn me on fire.  I'm going to be falling apart here and there.  Falling apart.  You're falling apart even when you're not the Scarecrow.  That's true.  You were falling apart in the summer, and you're still falling apart.  Take the DNA and run.  Take the money and run, I like it.  Everything you always wanted to know and couldn't.  Oh, fuck it.  Retards over Broadway. 
[02:54:30]  Bill's in!  Bill's in!  Hey, whatever you gotta do.  Bill Burr, Caroline's always along.  Went, went in Rome.  Buckles under the peer pressure.  Downs and misdemeanors.  Let's go to Chris the trucker.  Chris, what's up?  Hey, I was wondering, uh, how'd they get the mayor of Boston there to play the mayor in  that odd show you guys were talking about?  It sounded like Menino, didn't it?  We'd like to welcome you, the monkey club.  Tin man needs a wheelchair.  You've, uh, told us all about this part, Anthony. 
[02:55:00]  Yeah, the tin man, uh, some, uh, black guy in silver paint, um, in a wheelchair.  Being pushed by a tree.  Someone dressed as a tree trying to cover up the fact that he's in a wheelchair.  Yeah.  I had the same reaction.  See what I mean?  It's like a test.  It is.  To see if you can somehow hold your shit together.  Yeah, when I saw that, it was over.  Then David could give his line.  Where do we go now?  And the scarecrow can point back to the center of the car.  Where do we go? 
[02:55:30]  No, stand back.  Oh, boy.  He's getting a little unsteady.  He's getting unsteady.  Let's get a steady.  I'm steady.  We thought, wouldn't it be great if David could play the tin man with his crutches and  not be in the wheelchair?  And, you know, certainly he had that body form of the tin man.  And he was stiff and it was rigid and the movement would be difficult and that would play nicely.  But it just didn't come to be.  That's not appropriate.  I guess they wanted him on his crutches.  Like he had those braces crutches and his legs are real stiff and stuff and they wanted 
[02:56:00]  him to walk around like that.  Yeah.  She just blatantly exploited him.  Yeah.  Right?  He walks weird and we thought we would play into that.  He could really make an authentic walking tin man.  Well, his deformity is not only mental but physical so we figured we'd play with that and  make it work.  We spray painted him silver.  I mean painted him silver.  All he got to do is leave that dope in a room with silver paint.  He'll put his face in it.  There's gum at the bottom. 
[02:56:30]  Go ahead.  Enjoy, stupid.  Dave, what's going on?  Hey, it's good to hear Club Soda Candy getting some theater work.  Yeah.  And Frank.  Frank, what's up?  Hey man, is Big A going theatrical on us or what?  Yeah, Big A in the production?  Yeah, sounds like it.  We should do our own production with Big A, Club Soda Candy.  Oh yeah.  With Tar Laverne and Shirley.  All right. 
[02:57:00]  Why the director calls the slow kids kids?  I call these kids kids and sometimes people that don't work with me or my personal friends  say, you know, when they come to the show, I thought these kids were seven years old.  The way that you speak about them, you call them kids.  They're not kids.  They're adults.  But I kind of feel like a mom to them.  And so I feel like they are my kids.  And I think that we have that.  Beautiful.  That was too serious. 
[02:57:30]  Yeah.  That was a little serious.  She sucks.  If you pump out that many in that mental condition, you should probably stop fucking at one point.  It's not working out.  More from the witch.  Curses.  She's getting close to the Emerald City.  Well, shoes or no shoes, I'm still counting her.  Wait a minute.  I'm still great enough.  I'm still great enough to counter her.  To conquer.  To conquer her.  Good. 
[02:58:00]  To Emerald City as fast as lightning.  Their feet are too fat.  They have to give her a red ruby work boots.  Oh, my God.  Nick Swartzen in studio with us today.  Participating.  Participating.  Enjoying.  Yes.  I've got to get my uncle a head shot.  Yes. 
[02:58:30]  Miss Gulch works her line.  Mr. Gap.  Howdy, Miss Gulch.  I want to see you about Dorothy.  I want to see you about Dorothy.  I'm talking about a curtain.  Dolt.  Stop looking at the sandbag, stupid.  I want to talk to you about Dorothy.  What, the light?  Mr. Gap. 
[02:59:00]  Howdy, Miss Gulch.  I want to see you about Dorothy.  What's she doing?  Well, have you seen a bite on my leg?  She bit you?  No, her dog.  Oh, she bit you a dog.  No, her dog.  No, dogs are men.  I said, I'm taking him to the sheriff and making sure he's destroyed.  Third base.  They took some liberties with the original.  Yeah, I was just having us.  Yeah, really.  They improvised.  That's fine.  Third base.  They bit your leg. 
[02:59:30]  That did sound like I was against that.  Were there munchkins, or?  We don't see the munchkins in this.  Munchkins were all Down syndrome.  Like, they figured they would get all Down syndrome people to play the munchkins.  No, that's offensive to midgets.  Right.  So they couldn't do that part of the show.  Yeah, why can't you get midgets that are retarded?  They were absolutely using various handicaps as they were exploiting them.  But the munchkins all kind of look the same, and Down syndrome have certain features that 
[03:00:00]  are similar, let's say.  It's kind of like Planet of the Apes, where the gorillas were the aggressive ones.  Yes.  The orangutans were the smart ones, and the chimpanzees.  It's the same thing.  Yes.  Wait, Nick has to leave?  The working class.  Why are you leaving?  What?  I don't know.  I'm getting a communique from Ben Sparks.  What?  Nick has to leave.  He has another interview.  I want to hear the rest.  How many more tracks are there?  We'll go into 11 with this.  83 tracks.  11 p.m.  All right, we'll say goodbye to Nick.  He doesn't want to leave, but he has to leave. 
[03:00:30]  Sorry I have to go, Nick.  I know.  I'm sorry.  I hate to go.  And this isn't a, they're telling us you have to go.  No, not at all.  Absolutely not.  No, because sometimes we have to pull out the, they're telling us you've got to go.  Oh, really?  You know, when things aren't quite going well.  And the guest is like, no, I don't.  Like when Ed Asner was here, and we, fucking Ed Asner in L.A., we were all starstruck, and  he says, Ben comes over and signals, and Ed Asner goes, what was that?  And Ope goes, well, that's what Ben does when the guest is boring to fucking Ed Asner.  Ed Asner.  I've never hated this program more.  A classic. 
[03:01:00]  Oh my, what did he do?  He was hurt.  Oh, he unloaded.  Oh, he called, what, he basically called you a pariah.  He hated his guts.  He called me the destroyer.  The destroyer, yes.  The destroyer.  The punisher.  No way.  So he was hip to it, and he freaked out?  Oh yeah, he wasn't happy.  He kissed me on the cheek, he kissed Voss on the cheek, and he said that Ope was a fucking,  like a white wasp.  Oh, that's great.  Yeah, he couldn't stand him.  That's great.  He looks really like the kind of guy who could just, you know, squeeze you to death.  He is ultra-legged.  It was one of the most uncomfortable moments.  He is severe, like, liberal.  But he's such a sweet guy.  We don't have that quote anymore. 
[03:01:30]  We don't need to hurt Lou Grant.  And Ope was coming off like a real douchebag to him.  No.  No, hard to believe.  And he just, yeah, unloaded on him.  Well, he was boring.  I wasn't there.  I was playing poker at the time.  I'm sure I could have smoothed it all over.  Ope, the heartless point guard.  It was the good cop, bad cop, when the good cop was gone.  Yeah, it was basically Ed Asner and Justin Volpe.  All right, here we go.  Yellow Brick Road.  The retired production of Wizard of Oz.  Yeah.  More Tin Man.  I have the brain of a toad. 
[03:02:00]  I have the brain of a toad.  I should have been left on the sheet as a load.  I should have been left on the sheet as a load.  Oh, my God.  I just remembered.  You have to leave, Bill?  Oh, yeah.  Get out of here.  They're telling us.  You know what?  I did my laundry yesterday.  I didn't fold it.  You know, it's going to get all over.  It's going to wrinkle.  All right, here we go.  Since I've been born, my brain never growed.  I can talk again.  Oh, my goodness.  Oh, my goodness. 
[03:02:30]  I can talk again.  This feels wonderful.  On my arm, please.  How about I've held that axe up for ages?  I've held that axe up for ages.  My goodness.  My goodness.  My goodness.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, I stink.  You won't confuse me.  You've got a line.  That's why you can use me.  Don't use this hand.  My goodness.  Um, my goodness.  How'd you ever end up like that?  Good. 
[03:03:00]  Good.  Well, about a year ago, I was chopping that tree.  And suddenly, it began to rain.  Raining.  And right in the middle of a chop, I rested solid.  Bang on it.  Go ahead.  Bang on it.  Noble heart.  All hollow.  That was his head.  Dong, dong, dong, dong.  Well, they were doing good. 
[03:03:30]  It was rehearsal.  You know, it was a while.  There's such excitement in their voices.  Yeah.  They finally get to do something.  How did that happen?  Curses!  She's getting away.  She's getting close to the Emerald City.  Well, shoes or no shoes, I'm still great enough to counter her.  Conquer.  I'm still great enough to conquer her.  The witch starts melting because she's spitting on her.  Say it.  I'm still great enough to conquer. 
[03:04:00]  Conquer.  Conquer.  I'm still great enough to conquer.  That's how they say hit her.  I'm still great enough to conquer her.  Conquer on the head.  I don't like that word.  Get that retard.  Conquer.  She doesn't know what the word means.  They're just feeding her blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  She don't know what it means.  God bless this woman with patience.  How about tell her?  No kidding.  What about a little instruction there on conquer? 
[03:04:30]  It means to, you know, overtake somebody, to beat them, to win.  You know, give her a definition.  How about, um, think about what you've never done with a life problem.  Bill Burr.  More retard stick.  I'm trying to be helpful.  He's in rare fucking forms.  Oh, yes, he is. 
[03:05:00]  Here's the mayor talking about his award.  As mayor of Munston City, in the land, in the county of the land of Oz, I welcome you  most regally.  That's real regal.  And that's my only line.  Am I good?  No.  Way to break the fourth wall, stupid.  What did you win an award for?  Really wanted a chocolate factory.  What does that say?  Best supporting actor?  Yeah.  In a comedic role.  Uh-huh. 
[03:05:30]  Oof.  Played a chocolate bar.  Lay there and be brown, stupid.  At the end, you know nothing.  Good day, sir.  Oompa, loompa, loompa-dee-doo. 
[03:06:00]  I have one chromosome too few.  Doop-a-dee-dee.  If you are dumb, you'll really like me.  Sorry.  I guess the guy's a veteran of other stage shows.  Yeah, he's done a few plays. 
[03:06:30]  That's good.  He's got a resume.  As we move on here.  I've got a golden stain in my underpants.  I can't think of Willy Wonka's songs.  Here we meet the great eyes.  A heart is not judged by how much you love, but how much you are loved by others. 
[03:07:00]  Okay.  Good.  Man, that woman is patient.  Unbelievable.  She's doing that with her life.  Absolutely.  You've got to give it up to her.  Mm-hmm.  Jim?  Her codependency sickens me.  And if she had any fucking real chops, she'd be teaching in a college.  Wow.  No one saw the handfuls of Paxil she was taking out of Dorothy's basket.  Nobody sees her fucking crying alone in the bathroom. 
[03:07:30]  That's so fucking stupid.  I can't work with them anymore.  Her dreams were not what she's doing there.  Her dreams to produce a show.  For Broadway.  For Broadway, probably.  Yeah.  Was not that.  All right.  If I'm going to be cynical, she wants to get on 60 Minutes for them to do a whole expose  on how caring she is.  Oh, is that it?  And this is going to be her big thing.  You know what, Jim?  We're cynical.  We've got a host of benefits sometimes.  And I'll just say whatever the cause is and talk about how great it is, and then you  can just talk about what's going on behind the curtain. 
[03:08:00]  All right.  I like that.  I like that.  Be a wonderful.  It certainly would.  I'd be there.  We've got some great witch lines here.  Oh, some witch lines.  Let's not poke fun at them, though.  This is going too far.  Throw the basket in the river and drown him!  No, no.  Wow.  If that's not what her father said.  Yeah, stick to the script.  Let's not bring what you hear at home to the stage.  You might have wanted to leave that line out of the production. 
[03:08:30]  That sounded like Paula Poundstone.  Play it again.  Throw the basket in the river and drown him!  No, you can have your own slippers.  It's okay.  That's okay.  No, no.  You can have your own slippers.  Just give me back my dog.  That's a little good girl.  I knew you were seeing reason.  Wait a minute.  Elizabeth, that's a good little girl.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  That was horrible.  Wait a minute.  Yeah.  She has to stop and say, wait a minute.  Like, there's a piece of that that was usable. 
[03:09:00]  Wait a minute.  Wait.  The whole scrap.  All these go home.  Yeah, yeah.  I want to do outtakes.  Best stuff.  The blue first.  That was horrible.  That was a little real.  You are so fucking mean, man.  Look, Matt.  You're going to do this for 40 minutes.  I mean, I'm still also trying to hype that I'm at Caroline's this weekend.  Don't just blurt out sounds.  That was Joker hitting Pyle.  Like, he didn't want to do it.  And then when he did, he fucking really unloaded on him. 
[03:09:30]  Did I ever tell you a story when I first started out in comedy and was working in Framingham, Massachusetts?  They had this.  Ebeneezer's?  They had some nicks out there, right?  And they had literally this crowd of, like, 30 people.  And some lady showed up with this kid who was, like, severely, severely retarded, right?  Just like, eh, eh, making noises like that.  So they put this kid up on stage.  It was literally his third time on fucking stage.  So he's up there.  And this kid is making so much noise. 
[03:10:00]  Even if people were going to laugh at his jokes, there would have been nothing.  So he's just up there bombing in dead silence.  Except he'd, like, tell a joke and there'd be nothing.  And then the kid was like, eh, eh.  And literally by, like, his third joke, it was one of the greatest ad-libs I heard.  He went, like, he told the joke.  It got nothing.  The kid goes, eh, eh.  And the dude on stage goes, dude, I hear you.  Let's get into the witch, because we're running out of show here.  Oh, sorry.  Elizabeth, that's a good little girl. 
[03:10:30]  Oh.  Try it again.  That's a little good girl.  No, Elizabeth.  Oh, brother.  You know why she can't say it?  Because she's never heard it.  Nothing to base it on.  She keeps saying, that's a horrible disappointment.  I mean, no.  No, no.  Good little girl.  It's your fault.  You did drugs in college.  That's a good little girl.  We can leave her somewhere.  She'll never find us. 
[03:11:00]  No, that's a good little girl.  She'll never amount to anything.  Put her in an institution.  What if we stop feeding her?  Put that down, dummy.  No, that's not it.  That's a good little girl.  Let's move on here.  Yes.  Try it again.  You keep saying, that's a little good girl.  It's, that's a good little girl.  That's a good little girl.  I knew you were seeing reason. 
[03:11:30]  I just noticed, those slippers will never come off, as long as you're alive.  Let's go to, that's a good little girl.  Can we just do that from page 17?  Top of 17.  Go.  That's a little good girl.  That's a good little girl.  It's not a little good girl.  Wow.  Try it again.  That's a good, that's a good girl. 
[03:12:00]  I knew you were seeing reason.  The other kids are laughing at her.  Little girl, I forgot this.  Sorry.  I should have remembered.  I should have remembered.  Those shoes will never come off until you're alive.  Until you're alive?  I want to smack them all.  Those shoes will never come off until you're alive?  Until you're alive.  That's a little good girl.  I want to go give.  Just some sort of foundation. 
[03:12:30]  Yeah.  So do I.  The fucking pro-choice.  I want to go give to family planning.  Generously.  Generously.  All right.  Well, the witch tries it a third time.  Take three.  Run, Toto.  Run.  He got away.  It was more than you, Will, my pretty.  You're not much more to live.  Something like that.  Yeah.  Something like that is right.  Something like that.  Ah.  Something like that.  Who's that, Colin now?  No.  You know? 
[03:13:00]  Yeah.  I wish we could do that with this radio show.  Ah.  Something like that.  Whatever.  Something like that.  She used the fucking tippy-tom-out line to get out of that one.  Yeah.  Was that song you were singing?  Come on, baby, light my fire.  Something like that.  Something like that is right.  Nothing like that.  How about.  How about which is more than you, Will.  You haven't much longer to be alive, my pretty.  I can't wait forever to get those shoes.  I couldn't do this. 
[03:13:30]  Read it if you don't know it.  It's okay.  Do you know where we are?  Just cry.  Which is more than you, Will.  You haven't much longer.  She's on overload.  Which is more than you, Will.  You haven't much longer be alive, my pretty.  I can't wait ever to get those shoes.  Ah.  Too much information.  Wow.  Yeah.  Flop sweat.  Thank God it's a show that, like, everyone knows. 
[03:14:00]  There's no one that doesn't know the story to it, so you can sit there and kind of.  Fill in the blanks.  Yeah.  Fill in those many blanks.  Drek.  Drek.  Drek.  Ah.  Red shoes.  I see where we are.  Right.  Fill in the blank stares.  Dribble, dribble, drool, dribble.  Yeah.  Missed line, flub, unintelligible.  Flying monkeys.  Okay.  Here we are.  We're an hour in.  Flying monkeys.  Witch melting.  Okay.  We got it.  Oh, wait.  That's just the Tin Man's family.  Oh, my God. 
[03:14:30]  Down's kid has some trouble.  He's running away.  He's running away.  No.  Bridget, you're going to say, the dog is gone.  The dog is gone.  Yeah, man.  That's good.  Try it again.  You ready?  Let's go and run.  He's gone.  No, no, no, no.  Bridget, Joe goes first.  I just say it first, and then you say it first.  Stupid, Bridget.  Ready?  One, two, three.  Bridget.  Ready?  Go.  He's running away.  Oh, Jesus Christ. 
[03:15:00]  Listen to me.  Come on.  Ready?  Ready?  He's running away.  The dog is gone.  You got it?  Yes.  Bridget, you wanted to be a monkey, right?  Yes.  So, come on.  Ready?  One, two.  He's running away.  Go away.  Go away.  Go away.  Go away.  Dog ran away.  Dog, dog ran away.  Those real f***ing creep in.  The dog ran away.  I pet him, and he died when I pet him too hard.  No.  No, that's not what you're supposed to say.  The dog ran away. 
[03:15:30]  I eat his foot because it's soft.  I want to burn baby.  No, stupid.  Dog ran away.  Put him in the oven.  Dog ran away.  I sit on him with my big retard ass.  What a sexy name.  Oh, f***ing, Bridget is weighing this whole production down.  She's an anchor.  Production. 
[03:16:00]  Kirby.  Kirby from Oklahoma.  Kirby.  Dog ran away.  Dog ran away.  Into hiding you.  High-paying jobs and education.  None of that for you.  The retard can.  The retarded man can.  Hey, he's doing a little Willy Wonka tie-in.  A little late.  Oh, that was good.  A little low.  Yeah.  The dog is gone.  He's run away.  He's gone.  I can't see it.  Wow. 
[03:16:30]  Bridget's going to get replaced.  I think so.  Yeah.  And the other retards are laughing at you.  The dog is gone.  He's run away.  Excellent.  Excellent.  Excellent.  That's all it takes.  63 takes.  There's such small expectations.  Do you know Renee Zellweger is actually doing a movie about her?  It's called Bridget the Retard's Diary, where you just open it up, and it's all pages that  are stuck together with crayon scribble.  Half-eaten.  Yeah.  The fucking glue and the binding is all gone. 
[03:17:00]  She's picked it and put it in her eye.  We have never had perfection, obviously.  It's something we talk about, we dream about.  See, this is the 60 Minutes moment.  We'll never retain that.  And that's okay, because I really think that the great stuff comes in the possibilities,  not in the guarantees.  Yeah.  She's such an angel.  There's such a wide gap.  Now it's become all self-serving.  Yeah, it's her.  There's perfection and eating paste. 
[03:17:30]  And you've got to find a middle ground, lady.  Don't strive for the perfection.  Yes.  Give the kids a break.  Striving for the possibilities, which is that we'll make it through this production without  someone starting a fire.  Someone skipping down the yellow brick road and tripping on some poopy.  They all have yellow brick underpants, don't you, you adult babies? 
[03:18:00]  You know what would be the ultimate for you guys, to actually get one of the performers  from this play to come in here and hype it?  I'll plug the show.  Yes.  That's not a bad idea.  We've had all the retards.  The great and powerful Oz, who is going to grant your request.  Every word.  Say it one more time.  Is the silence whippersnapper, I am the greater power for Oz, who is going to grant your request. 
[03:18:30]  I owe Oz money, and I'm dodging him.  Pay no attention to that walnut behind the skull.  I don't know if we did this one last week, but pay no attention to that man behind the  curtain in the family picture. 
[03:19:00]  Bill's tapping out.  Bill's tapping out.  Pay no attention to that embarrassment under the Pete Rose bank.  We're running out of time.  We have ten to go.  Pay no attention to that man that everyone else is throwing berries at.  Pay no attention to me. 
[03:19:30]  I'm used to it.  Eight more minutes.  Here's the witch.  Here's the witch.  Talking about how she never gets the best rolls.  I try and do my best, but Trish always gets the main roll.  Pay no attention to that sonogram.  Mother didn't. 
[03:20:00]  Oh, shit.  The witch.  Talking about how she doesn't get the good rolls.  That's not the only one, Dolph.  I'm on.  You know what?  There's egos in this, too.  Show them what Dorothy says.  Ding dong, I shit my bed.  Dottos, I have a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore.  There's no place like home.  Nothing at all inside my head.  I think she's like a role model to me, because who I am as an actress. 
[03:20:30]  Just tap your heels three times and say, there's no one that loves me at home.  There's no one that loves me at home.  Look at Bill.  There's no place like the home.  There's no place like the home.  Oh, shit.  All right, the mayor has something very important to say here. 
[03:21:00]  Of course he does.  I'm not allowed to cross the street, but if I'm with you guys, I'm allowed to walk in the street.  I'm like the mayor around here now, since you guys came.  That's actually the music that they hear in their head.  Yeah, they've got to play that music every time.  The great Oz gives Tin Man a heart.  As for you, my good friend, you want a heart.  You don't know how lucky not to have one. 
[03:21:30]  You are not to have one.  You are not to have one.  Wait, David.  And remember my sentimental friend.  A heart is not judged how much you love, but how much you are loved by others.  Josh, that's the one line you have to get.  Why don't they just have them do a period piece?  I mean, you could have picked something a little bit. 
[03:22:00]  They're fucking doing Latin.  How about a Charlie Brown Christmas?  It's fucking lightening up a little bit.  A little bit.  He's having a real tough time with that.  Who goeth there?  Relieve the pressure a little bit.  Wait, do we have any audio of the fucking guy talking about how he's in my brain?  Chromosome, chromosome.  Where far art thou, chromosome?  Girl, I don't know, I don't know why, can't get enough of your love's brain. 
[03:22:30]  Oh, something that can't get used to, no matter how I try.  I don't know why, it's like the more you give, the more I want.  And baby, that's no lie.  Oh, no, baby.  I don't remember this.  Tell me.  The Wizard of Oz.  What can I say?  Tom Jones with Down Syndrome?  No, that was a black retarded kid picking up the three white retarded chicks.  We've run out of show. 
[03:23:00]  He's black and he's retarded.  Can you imagine how huge his cock is?  Go get my limo.  I've got my herni.  It's in Norton.  That makes me sound like a really talented comic.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Only creeps listen to this program.  That's right.  That's a bunch of lies.  Sit down and put on your laughing hat.  It's time for the Opie and Anthony Show.

[03:25:30]  Listen large.  This is Jim Blassingame, the small business advocate with a Small Business Minute.  Every business today has an almost infinite number of competitors,  especially when the Internet is considered.  Since this has led to the commoditization of almost everything,  many competitors are tough to beat when price is the prime consideration.  Does this sound like bad news for small business?  It's not.  It's good news because any business that sells only on price  must operate with tight profit margins and diminished customer service. 
[03:26:00]  Small businesses don't need everyone to do business with them to be successful.  Just enough people who are looking for value more than price.  Our success in the 21st century will be found in customization, versatility,  delivering high value, and saving customers' time, not by fighting the price war.  Write this on a rock.  Don't fight the price war.  It's over and small business lost.  Fight the value war.  We can win that one.  This is Jim Blassingame, the small business advocate.  I'll see you on the radio or on the Internet at smallbusinessadvocate.com.

[03:29:00]  And now, a minute with the New York Times.  Here's food and wine critic Eric Asimov.  With all the trendy Pinot Noir producers sprouting up in California,  it's easy to forget one of the best, possibly because it's one of the most familiar.  Calera Wine Company has been making Pinot Noir since the mid-1970s when Josh Jensen planted four vineyards high up on Mount Harlan in Monterey County,  a rugged, isolated spot of chalky limestone soil that pretty much remains the sole domain of Calera. 
[03:29:30]  Each of the four vineyards, Mills, Jensen, Selick, and Reed, has its own character,  and it's fascinating to taste them together for the subtle, nuanced differences that begin to show themselves after five to ten years.  Calera has now planted a fifth vineyard, Ryan, and soon it will take its place alongside the original four.  Calera also makes an excellent Chardonnay and Viognier and some well-priced Central Coast wines,  but its single vineyard Pinot shine among California's best.  This is Eric Asimov of the New York Times.

Hi, this is the worst of the Opie and Anthony Show, but it's not bad stuff, it's all good things.  The worst part is when it's over, because that's when Uncle Henry climbs into bed with me and covers my face with his bottom brownies.  Opie and Anthony!  Find a happy place. 
[03:30:30]  Julie!  Yeah?  Help me out.  Okay, Anthony.  Yes, Julie.  Stop with the freaking granola.  It's wonderful, and people do eat that in the woods.  I'm out in the middle of Montana, out in Grizzly Country, backpacking, and that is exactly what people eat.  We ate goose-coos and grilled vegetables, because animals don't smell that as something different from the environment.  You goddamn hippie.  I'm probably, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm totally not a hippie. 
[03:31:00]  I'm totally a corporate person.  You totally are.  I have a corporate job, but you know what?  Well, are you a vegan man?  And Opie, let me tell you, a really good breakfast.  Yeah?  Steel-cut oatmeal.  Don't cook it.  I've started that, but it takes a half hour.  No, don't cook it.  Don't cook it.  And then put skim milk, coconut, peanuts, walnuts, frozen blueberries.  Fish oils and blueberries. 
[03:31:30]  I was with you, but this steel-cut oatmeal, I started cooking that crap up.  You can't eat that without cooking it.  Yeah, you can.  It's like eating little pebbles.  Don't cook it.  All the nutrients will come out of, are you a vegetarian?  Not at all.  No, you eat meat?  Absolutely.  Okay.  I had you pegged as one of those, one of them vegans.  I'm totally not one of those type of people.  But when you are traveling, when you're backpacking and doing that type of thing,  you need things that are light.  Oatmeal is one of them. 
[03:32:00]  Light.  You don't carry sugar.  You carry, you know, you carry other alternatives.  How far are you backpacking that you've got to, like,  figure in the weight of the food that you're carrying?  How long do you go for?  A couple days.  A couple of days.  How much food are you going to carry where it's like,  well, that puts us over the top for weight?  I never understood the whole walking in the woods thing.  Like, where are you walking to?  Is there, what's the goal?  Well, you know, my goal was just, I wanted to see wildlife in Montana, 
[03:32:30]  so I got to see grizzlies running in the wild.  I mean, how many people can actually say they saw grizzly bears?  We do every day.  Comes in with lousy clips.  That's why I would never do that shit.  You, like, instantly realize, you know, why we live inside.  Everything's faster.  Everything can fly, fucking run.  I mean, if a squirrel wanted to attack you, it would win.  It could kick your ass.  It could.  You couldn't stop it.  You would be freaking out, screaming like a girl.  And you're sitting there with your backpack and a walking stick, 
[03:33:00]  just in case something jumps out at you.  You think you're so tough until you walk in the woods and realize, yeah.  Did you ever see that lady?  She's riding the mountain bike, and this mountain lion jumped on her.  Yeah.  Literally was only on her for half a second, ripped half her face off.  Her face right off.  Well, you always fight mountain lions back.  You can win on the mountain lions.  Yeah, sure you can.  How?  Well, first of all, you carry knives.  Oh, there you go.  All right, Tarzan.  And you carry pepper spray.  Pepper spray.  And it's not a little bottle.  It's not a little canister. 
[03:33:30]  It's a huge bottle that clips onto your pack.  Yeah.  Would you have it in your hand as you're walking through the woods?  Yeah, because those things don't announce their arrival,  especially when you're riding a bike, a mountain bike,  and a mountain lion eats your face.  He didn't announce that he's coming out.  Well, no.  Mountain lions, you have to be most concerned about mountain lions  because they're very, very stealth-like animals.  You know, they hunt you.  Nice.  Whereas the bears, if you walk into their paths...  See, that's why you can't go walking in the woods and hiking and stuff,  knowing that these things might be just looking at you 
[03:34:00]  and deciding if they're going to pounce on you or not.  I was lost in the woods once.  You really don't have much of a problem.  Black bear comes right down one of the trails,  and I just stopped dead in my tracks and looked at it,  and if it decided it was going to turn around and do anything,  it didn't do anything.  It just continued on its way.  But if it decided it wanted to do anything, what was I going to do?  Did we ever tell this story?  Yeah, I told it on the air a while ago.  You sure?  Yeah.  Because I thought this happened after we...  Told it when we got back.  Oh, we did.  Okay. 
[03:34:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, I was upstate New York.  Anthony got lost in the woods.  Went hiking and went down the different side of the mountain  and got lost in the woods overnight.  But I was thinking...  By yourself?  In October.  Me and my chick.  All right, Julie.  Thank you.  We had to find a lean-to that was like...  We found these signs, these signs that said lean-to this way.  What does that mean?  It meant that there was this lean-to, a piece of wood on the ground.  That just protects it from the ground.  And some wood on the ground so you're not laying on the ground. 
[03:35:00]  It was pouring rain.  It was freezing cold, and we had nothing.  Were you crying?  We were.  I was so close to just losing my mind and busting into tears and just losing...  They went for like a two-hour hike.  Two-hour hike.  Did you send this story into Reader's Digest?  And then...  And we just kept walking and walking and walking.  And it got to the point where we had to go down these cliffs  where once we went down them, I knew there was no turning back and going back up.  You just had to keep going. 
[03:35:30]  And there was just nothingness.  And we had no food, no water.  It was raining, so we stood under this big tree that was dripping water  with our mouths open just to get water.  And finally, the next...  So it started getting dark, and I'm like, we can't walk out of here in the dark.  There's no way it's going to happen.  We will fall and break something because there are cliffs and stuff.  So we saw the sign for this lean-to.  We got there.  It was already dark by the time we got there.  Had one jacket, which we both had to sleep under. 
[03:36:00]  Didn't sleep much.  Woke up the next morning.  We had been walking so long that my ankles, I could barely move them.  It was so...  So now I'm walking like a cripple for the rest of the way to try to get out.  Another eight hours walking out of the woods.  Finally popped out onto a road and found some kind of a ranger station  and got driven back.  Yeah.  It was just the worst.  And I will never, ever go hiking again.  And you saw a bear. 
[03:36:30]  Yeah, a bear walking across the path.  And I'm like, oh, great.  Going to be eaten by a bear.  This is fantastic.  Great.  I don't fuck with nature on any level.  I don't go in the ocean.  No, no ocean?  Oh, my God.  The ocean is the scariest goddamn thing.  There are so many monsters under there.  The water alone, that whole...  What's that thing, the riptide or the undertow?  Yeah, undertow and the rip currents.  And you're supposed to just relax and be like, okay, it's pulling me this way.  I just got to swim to the side.  You don't do that.  You're like...  Sucking in...  Fucking shrimp and shit. 
[03:37:00]  You're dead.  Nobody does that.  That is so funny.  Yeah, just relax as you're getting pulled out and don't know how far out you're going to be pulled.  Yeah, I'm supposed to wet my finger and see which way it's the fucking...  Where's the wind blowing?  Yeah.  And I'm being brought out in this current.  Now, it's going to bring me out.  And then swim...  Sideways.  Yeah, sideways.  Parallel to the shore.  Parallel to the shore until you're out of the rip current.  Yeah.  No fucking way.  Sure.  No way.  Put the knife in your teeth just in case the sharks get you.  And a shark, it's like not only are you getting eaten, you're drowning at the same time. 
[03:37:30]  It's like everything but being lit on fire.  It's like the worst fucking...  It's two out of three of the worst deaths ever.  And it's not like there's not options.  There's pools.  There's lakes.  I'll swim in that shit.  You know there's nothing under there going to get...  Yeah, even like a lake.  It's just like...  Lakes are scary, too.  Yeah.  That's one of those things.  And they don't give up.  They're dead.  Yeah.  The water is so cold that whatever fuck happens in your intestines, you never float to the  top.  So you're just down the bottom.  You and a fucking pirate.  Just...  From fucking... 
[03:38:00]  Fucking 400 years ago.  That's how you have to spend eternity with a fucking pirate.  You and a fucking pirate.  Holy shit.  I think it's a little long, but that could be a new name for a member of Wackbag.  Me and a fucking pirate.  Yeah.  That is horrible.  That's classic.  You don't...  Yeah.  I did a gig with a dude when I was in Green Bay, and he goes, I own some property.  So he goes up to show it to me. 
[03:38:30]  And we went up there, and there were bear tracks.  And we were 10 feet from the car, and I just went right back to the car.  Yeah.  He's like, they don't do it unless they're hungry.  Yeah, sure.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Aren't they usually hungry?  Yeah.  Because their whole life is looking for food.  Pretty much.  Yeah.  Unless they're having sex to make more.  I've seen you do comedy.  You suck at that.  So I don't...  I'm not going to go out on a limb.  I'm not believing you.  Yeah.  Your wildlife skills are just as well.  I like going down to the Bahamas and going in that water there.  But I never go out over my head. 
[03:39:00]  And still, like you said, it's creepy.  You could see down to your feet.  The water's completely clear.  That kind of helps me out a little.  I'm constantly looking around.  I swim out to the buoys and everything.  No.  Oh, yeah.  I did it one time.  I went to the Dominican Republic and I did that snorkeling thing.  Yeah.  And it's just all these schools of fish were going around.  And everybody's like, oh, yeah, it's so beautiful.  I'm like, dude, this is fucking bait for bigger fish.  And you're swimming in it.  No, and you just see them every once in a while when you would get near.  Just even like a little fish.  When it wanted to, bam, it was gone. 
[03:39:30]  And I'm fucking this big lumbering.  Yeah.  My snorkel.  I mean, I would be, you know.  You know the creepiest part of snorkeling?  Anything that wanted to kill me.  It would have killed you.  Oh, yeah.  Snorkeling or scuba diving, the creepiest thing is when you look off into the distance under there.  And it just fades into fogginess, though.  And then darkness.  And you're just waiting for something to come out of it that's bigger than you.  Picture that Jaws moment when he's in, like, the cage.  The cage.  And it goes away.  And then it comes back from the other side. 
[03:40:00]  Yeah, yeah.  And it slams into it.  You're just waiting.  You look around and go, I know something's just going to come flying at me from out of that haze.  Plus, I also hear, like, sharks from, like, hundreds of miles away when they hear, like, a splash can tell distress.  So I'm trying to calmly not be attracting anything.  And you know damn well you're looking through this haze trying to see something with your stupid landlubber eyes.  And the shark, like, he's 15 miles away and sees you perfectly.  Like, clear as day.  Some sort of radar on his neck. 
[03:40:30]  Yeah.  Knows it's you.  Knows your food.  Knows you're scared.  Yeah.  Coming at you at 60 miles an hour.  There you are with your flippers.  Yeah, all that stuff.  Snakes.  All of it.  Creepy shit.  I'm going to go to Wisconsin.  That's it.  Paul?  Hey, how's you guys doing?  All right, Paul.  Go ahead.  Hey, that murky water shit scares me, too.  Hey, when I lived up in Alaska, I lived up there for, like, four years.  And you'd have to be a nut to go out in the woods with pepper spray and a knife. 
[03:41:00]  They always told everyone up there, you've got to bring a gun and a dog.  Because, like, I guess those animals are so wild, they don't understand what, they think a dog's a wolf, so they're looking for more of them.  So they kind of leave you alone.  Yeah, a dog is probably pretty handy to have if an animal attacks you.  And a gun.  Yeah, a dog is like an appetizer.  That's like potato skins.  Yeah, that'll hold off the animal long enough.  That's your meat shield until you can pull your weapon out and shoot. 
[03:41:30]  Don't get attached to your dog if you're going to be using him for this purpose.  And as he's getting eaten by the animal, as the animal's mouth is full of your dog's throat, then you fire a few rounds into his head.  Not caring if you hit your own dog because you really didn't love him.  Hey, this is a good question for Anthony.  Chris, go ahead.  That'll hold off.  Chris, turn down your radio and talk to us.  Let's go.  Yeah, I wanted to know if y'all were spooning with that one jacket, that lean-to.  Yes, we were spooning.  Were you spooning, Anthony?  No, we slept on separate sides of the lean-to. 
[03:42:00]  Of course.  You didn't sleep, though.  I dozed off a couple of times.  But let me tell you something, how creepy it is.  It was raining, very cold rain, thunder and lightning.  And so I'm laying in the lean-to.  You guys were lucky to find the lean-to.  Very, very.  And it was just...  We couldn't make any fire, though.  So it was still very cold.  Why?  You've watched Survivor.  Stop it.  Everything's soaking wet.  And in ideal conditions, it's impossible to make a fire. 
[03:42:30]  What would you do to start a fire, you think?  I think what I would do...  If everything was dry, would you attempt to start a fire?  I would have attempted.  Probably, I would have looked for any kind of string that was around and made a bow and  tried to wrap a straight piece of wood and then use another piece of wood with a little  rut cut in it and then put the straight piece with the bow and grab a rock with some kind  of indent and put it on top of the straight piece and then with a bow back and forth real 
[03:43:00]  quick, try to make some friction in the other piece of wood.  Sure, sure.  Yeah, that would have worked.  We saw that on Survivor.  It wouldn't have worked.  It took them days to start a fire.  It's a talent that takes a lot of practice.  No, so I'm laying there in the lean-to and now I got a sideways view of the world because  I'm kind of laying down.  It's very creepy and with each lightning bolt, the whole wood's lit up.  It's like a horror movie.  We're just waiting for that face.  We're just waiting for that face.  Right. 
[03:43:30]  You see the face for the split second, then it's pitch dark again.  Yes.  I was waiting.  Holy crap.  Not even so much where the face would be right by your face, but in the distance at the tree  line by where this little clearing for the lean-to was, every time it lit up, I would  just expect to see some horrific silhouette of the person that's going to kill us.  Yeah, yeah, evil dead, some type of, just zombie, anything.  This is actually making me want to take like a survival class because I really, you know, 
[03:44:00]  if something ever happened and like the whole system just failed, I would last literally  like about 18 minutes.  Walking around the woods was like your laptop, still believing that the system was coming  back.  That would be my lean-to.  That would be my lean-to.  I'd just open it up and stick my big, big head underneath it.  What if you saw like red eyes out in the woods?  Dude, I would have freaked out.  I was on the brink, on the brink the entire time. 
[03:44:30]  And then the night was, it took so long.  Like it got dark, I guess at about seven o'clock.  So by seven o'clock, we're in this lean-to and I know we're not going to be able to move  for 12 hours until the sun comes back up.  So you'd nod off and then like wake back up and I go, okay, how long was that?  I'd look at my watch and it's like, I nodded off.  Last time I looked at the watch, maybe it was nine o'clock at night.  It's like 9, 15.  I'd been out for maybe 15 minutes. 
[03:45:00]  I thought it would be two in the morning.  You should have taken turns.  Turns what?  Someone watch and the other sleep.  No, there was no watching.  Someone's got to be Charlie Sheen and see that Viet Cong in the distance from the lightning.  Yeah, click your claymores.  That's right.  Yeah, that's pretty much what I was expecting, just to see the bushes kind of come alive.  Here's the question I got for you.  Yeah.  When does it get to the point where it's every man for themselves?  Oh, where I would have to...  Tough question, I understand.  Because, you know, you love your chicken stuff. 
[03:45:30]  But when does it, you're in that situation.  The survival instinct chicken.  When do you, how far does it get, or how bad does it get before you decide it's every  man for themselves?  Well, I think if either one of us snapped a leg or something, I think then the other  one just has to go.  Bear's coming.  Leave the other one.  Bear's coming.  She doesn't run as fast as you, let's say.  Are you waiting?  No, I told her, stay there.  Because I was walking kind of a little ahead, and when I saw the bear, I turned around and  just said, stay right there.  Don't move. 
[03:46:00]  And the bear, like, walked across.  But everyone has that breaking point where you have to go into every man for themselves.  No.  Just him limping along like Dustin Hoffman in Papillon.  With my...  I was hobbled.  It was worse than that.  It was worse than that.  I was like James Caan in...  What movie was that?  I'm your biggest fan.  In Misery.  Misery, sure.  Yeah, I'm your number one fan.  I was like hobbled.  Both ankles were useless.  Because you're climbing...  The whole day before, we were climbing up rocks and stuff, and you're using a lot of your 
[03:46:30]  leg muscles, and then to just stop in the cold rain and sleep, there was no stretching.  Yeah, I'm going to stretch this out now.  Yeah.  I'm petrified.  It's raining, and we're lost in the woods, but I'm going to do my stretching.  You just want to make yourself look real small.  I was exhausted, so we just, you know, crapped out for as long as we could.  And then waking up the next morning, my legs were...  I was like, oh my God, I'm not going to be able to walk out of here.  I am crippled.  I need a wheelchair. 
[03:47:00]  But then, you know, after walking a little while, you kind of get better.  But then we saw like little things.  They were trails that I guess people use for hiking, but God knows when or, you know, when  you're ever going to see another person.  So there were these little things nailed to a tree.  We found one.  It looked like a mailbox, an old wooden mailbox.  And you lift it up, and it had like you could leave notes there, and it had like a map and  things.  And that's how we realized which way we had to go.  And we left a note walking this way on trail, lost, but we had to leave a little note in 
[03:47:30]  there.  And then...  They had pencils inside this little thing and left a little note.  And it was a very harrowing experience.  Well, Ray in California has a question for you, too.  Ray, go ahead.  Hey, Anthony.  Hey.  Hey, Anthony.  Are you really going to give your pug-a-doodle up to the bear?  Well, you know, the pug-a-doodles are so cute that I would have a problem with that.  Hey, Anthony, I got a better idea.  I'll give you my ex-wife. 
[03:48:00]  Does that work?  Oh, an ex-wife would have been perfect.  I'd have lobbed her bodily into the bear's mouth.  I'd have been like, bear, yo.  You've been chumming for bear.  All right.  Hey, Fred.  Hey, thanks for taking the call.  Fred in Arizona.  Hey, thanks.  I know Jimmy's listening, so happy birthday, Jimmy.  And the Ramon thing, can you explain that?  I missed that day, the inside joke yesterday.  It was absolutely hilarious, the Ramon caller. 
[03:48:30]  Ramon.  Maybe one day we'll do inside joke day.  And explain some of these incidents.  Really, he was sprinting with little boy scouts.  Well, Ramon is, we have to explain this again, is Steve's imaginary little butt buddy.  Well, it's not really.  When we first started here, we needed production pieces.  You know, those little things you hear during our commercial breaks for the Opie and Anthony show.  A little teaser, things like that for the show. 
[03:49:00]  A little promo for the show.  And Steve was putting these things together.  And it was various different ideas that he would just pull out of his ass and come up with.  One of these things was the Ramon concept.  It was this fictional characters.  One of them is a rich voiceover guy who might be that guy you hear for the movie trailers and stuff.  And he does work from a home studio.  He has a big mansion.  And inside that mansion, he doesn't do much work.  His houseboy, Ramon, does all the work. 
[03:49:30]  And the gag is that this guy is doing a promo for the Opie and Anthony show.  And in the middle of it, something bad happens.  And he needs Ramon's help to solve whatever problem it may be.  Some are an example.  He crapped himself and crap went all over his shoes.  So in the middle of doing his Opie and Anthony promo, he goes, Ramon, clean this up.  Or clean off my shoes or whatever the fuck one that was.  And then it was like a series that started where different disgusting things would happen. 
[03:50:00]  And Ramon would have to clean up.  To the point, Fred, we hated it so much that we'd all walk around and just go, Ramon.  Ramon.  So Jimmy took it to the next level.  And now he fucks with some of our guests by doing it.  Saying he's Steve from Yellowstone.  Yeah, and he does the bit for the person that's in studio.  And the person has no clue where it came from.  Laughed out loud in the office.  That was hilarious. 
[03:50:30]  Yeah.  All right.  Thanks, Fred.  Hey, I know that he's spooning with little Boy Scouts.  All right.  Thank you.  Let's say hi to Tom.  Tom, what's up?  Hey, how you doing?  Hey, man.  I got a story about diving in the Bahamas last year.  We do a lot of diving, and we go to Stewart's Cove in Nassau, Bahamas.  And we were on a dive trip, and my buddy and I were in the water, and we went out over a drop-off.  It drops off about 5,000 feet, and we were about 120 feet down.  And I got my back to the open water, and he's looking at me, and he gets this sheer look of terror on his face to the point where he can't even lift his arms. 
[03:51:00]  And he's pointing at me, trying to point at me, and I turn around, and there's this 30-foot whale shark about 5 feet from the back of my head.  He's just swimming by.  And I turned around to find him, and he's on his way up to the surface already, you know, because he couldn't – I guess he freaked out, couldn't deal with the man.  Aren't whale sharks, like, as big as –  They're huge, but they don't hurt you.  No, they're actually vegetarians. 
[03:51:30]  They don't eat – all they eat is plankton.  Yeah, but when you see something like that in the water when you're diving, it doesn't matter.  Yeah, I mean, you know, you hear stories about them.  We've got a lot of dives, and you hear stories about them, and the average sizes are, you know, 20 to 30 feet, and they get as big as 45, 50 feet.  And when you get one close enough to where you can pretty much reach out and touch it, I don't care how many stories you hear.  You know, it gets pretty –  No, I don't care what it is.  There shouldn't be stuff the size of dinosaurs around you.  It was fucking huge, and the only thing that compares to that was a manta ray swimming at us with a mouth the size of a Volkswagen, you know, which is another thing that doesn't eat you, but you could easily crawl inside this thing, this open – 
[03:52:00]  Do you have any stories about animals that could eat you, that swam towards you?  Oh, actually –  And this 40-pound goldfish.  I mean, when I say this thing was puckering as it came at us, I mean, I thought I was going to have a hickety.  I'm going to have a hickety from my forehead to my waist.  I know they can't eat you, but still.  Still, we're scared. 
[03:52:30]  We're going to Arcadia.  Six fathoms.  We're going to Arcadia, Maine, where this guy does gray white diving inside a cage, so I don't know.  I'll call back or not after that happens.  All right.  Thank you, Tom.  Thanks.  Bye.  I don't care if it doesn't eat meat.  In that situation, you're pretty scared.  Absolutely.  Of course.  It's just that he went to another one.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah, that's why I stay in the house these days.  Rob in New Jersey?  Yeah, how you doing?  Hey, Rob. 
[03:53:00]  How you doing?  Yeah, every man for himself.  I live in West Milford, and we had a bear in our yard.  I seen the thing.  I took off, and I pushed my girl out of the way.  That's a relationship ender right there.  Yep.  I'm telling you, though, everyone has that point, though, in them where it's every man for themselves.  What is it?  Freaky.  Everyone should think about it today.  How far do you have to go in a situation before you're like, all right, it's every man for themselves?  I knew when we were lost, and I was hanging on by my fingernails to my sanity. 
[03:53:30]  I was like, if I just completely lose my mind, it's a relationship ender.  You were still thinking about your relationship?  Yeah.  I would have been just like...  That's what I'm saying.  No, I was still thinking about it.  It's like, no, if I just, like a lunatic, ripping my hair out, running down the trail,  I've got to get out of here!  It's over, Johnny.  You don't go back home and go, so, Poopsie, what's on tonight?  Pick up the remote.  You don't do that after you just lose your mind like that. 
[03:54:00]  That's when you get the, we need to take a break speech.  Yeah, exactly.  It was one of those situations where, you know, you've got to try your best not to, yeah,  throw her in the path of a bear.  I, you know, I can climb this, you can't go fuck yourself kind of thing.  No arguments in the woods?  No, there weren't.  We were very quiet.  Honey, come on!  Oh, there was no talking?  No, it was just, because if we talked, I think the subject would have come up like,  people die like this.  This is great.  This is what you read about, you know? 
[03:54:30]  So, we just kept, kept walking.  We found the big, drippy water tree and was like, oh, hey, we should drink some of this.  And, you know.  You were Harry Potter.  It was.  We found the big, drippy water tree.  Big, drippy water tree.  No, it was, thank God.  At first, we were just finding like leaves with little like thimble full of water in it  if you were lucky.  And you'd have to do that like 20 times to get anything.  You could go a day without water. 
[03:55:00]  No.  Yeah.  Very thirsty.  Oh, come on.  Thirsty.  But then we found the tree and somehow this tree would channel the water down to a few  of the branches and then just come pouring off the tree.  I was like, ooh, that is good.  Another day like out there, you would have been praying to that tree.  You would have told you would dress.  It would have been like, yeah, the God that just mud smeared all over us, killing people  that come near the tree, making spears. 
[03:55:30]  All right.  Heywood Jablomi, that old gag from Whackbag.  Opie, great idea.  Just answering that question would be a relationship ender.  You love to start trouble, don't you?  Oh, what?  When's the line?  Yeah, every man for themselves.  And Dennis C. from New York, very pissed off.  Opie, homo.  I would never get to that point.  I've been married for 10 years.  I love my wife more than life itself.  I would die first.  F you.  She was looking over his shoulders.  He typed that.  You think?  It's like, relax, man. 
[03:56:00]  It was just a question.  And another one I read was, you guys are faggots.  Bears and sharks scaring you.  Bunch of faggots.  Like, he's the tough guy.  He's the guy that, you know.  You know what I would have done?  Yeah.  Yeah, that's him.  Yeah, you faggot.  You just don't know how to handle those situations.  Let me tell you about it.  Yeah, right.  Sure.  You're scared shitless.  Hey, he doesn't know.  You know what gets me through those moments? 
[03:56:30]  Guns.  Yes.  If I had a gun with me, I would have been fine.  Would have been fine.  I put so much faith in firearms.  You would have been whistling tunes all night long.  Yeah.  In that lean tune.  I would.  I would have.  Yeah.  I'd have slept.  I'd have slept fine.  I'd have slept fine because I know if something would have happened, I heard some crackling  going on.  Boom.  Unloaded.  I would have been out of ammo in the first 10 minutes.  Any sound I heard, I would have been walking around with the thing drawn the whole time. 
[03:57:00]  It looked like the scene in Predator when they all just open up on what they think is the  Predator.  Vegetation falling down.  That's Bill Burr.  You're a funny guy.
