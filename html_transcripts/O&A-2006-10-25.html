<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a comedic, fictional news report about a rage-inducing virus.  The hosts, Opie, Anthony, and James Norton, then transitioned into discussing various news headlines, including Kurt Cobain's top-earning deceased celebrity status, surpassing Elvis.  A significant portion of the early show was dedicated to their disgust with a particularly foul-smelling microphone, prompting a discussion about the unsanitary conditions of mics in comedy clubs.  Further news items covered a subway flasher's arrest, a MySpace attack, and Halloween's association with sexual predators, sparking debate about the validity of this heightened concern.  A story about a woman with twins of different races led to humorous speculation about paternity, followed by commentary on a woman seeking plastic surgery to become uglier.

The show then promoted "Whip-A-Bow Wednesday," a listener participation segment, and criticized the small size of stickers provided by a San Francisco station, accusing them of excessive political correctness and censorship, especially regarding racial humor.  This led to a discussion of their own experiences with censorship, citing instances where jokes about Barack Obama were deemed unacceptable.  They debated the hypocrisy of censorship and the disproportionate targeting of white comedians making racial jokes.  A heated, offensive exchange with a caller, Joanne, ensued, filled with racial slurs and insults from both sides.  Further callers contributed to the discussion about the line between offensive humor and hate speech, with the hosts defending their racial humor as satire.

The broadcast continued with more listener calls and discussions, including updates on Jerry Springer's participation in "Dancing with the Stars," and promotion of the Opie and Anthony Halloween party.  They also promoted Jim Norton's stand-up show,  and mentioned upcoming guests Jim Belushi, Danny Bonaduce, and a potential call from Tina Fey.  A substantial portion focused on Jerry and Kim's low dance competition scores, urging listeners to vote for them.  Racially charged jokes about a guest named Sam followed.  Opie's infamous cake-stomping incident on a homeless man's cake was recounted with audio clips, and the homeless man's reaction ("I earned that cake") was repeated.  The hosts played and reacted to highly offensive and negative political campaign ads, including one using the N-word, with the hosts finding the ads highly entertaining.  Comedian Bob Kelly called in to promote his tour.  A bizarre, fabricated campaign ad attacking Congressman Ron Kind, falsely accusing him of misappropriating funds for various sex-related studies, was discussed, leading to the hosts' joking endorsement of Kind for President.  A caller mentioned an Alabama woman using her breasts in a campaign ad, leading to discussion of her opponent, Paul R. Nelson, whose own ad was played and criticized.  A Chicago radio employee confirmed their signal reached Wisconsin.

Danny Bonaduce joined as a guest, sharing anecdotes about his life, including training under Chuck Norris, steroid use, experiences on "Breaking Bonaduce" and "CSI," and a fight with a UFC fighter.  He also discussed his personal life and wife.  The show revisited Opie's cake-stomping incident, recounting a confrontation with a listener, Bill Hughes, who disapproved of the action.  A woman brought a replacement cake, but it was incredibly dry and inedible, leading to further comedic exchanges.  A segment detailed a disastrous cake brought by an intern, Andrea, described as incredibly dry and unappetizing.  The hosts and guests, including a studio intern and Craig, sampled the cake with expressions of disgust. Jimmy Norton’s grandmother’s infamous cake comparison was recounted.  The discussion covered a Thanksgiving-themed FHM photo shoot, ridicule of a listener, “P. Hart from Jersey,” a White House visit (with a joke about pointing guns at the President),  E-Roc's discarded wings, and a phone interview with Tina Fey that ended abruptly.

Another segment featured Jimmy Norton discussing his upcoming, unprepared audition for a role as an ex-con.  A significant portion focused on a listener's claim that Opie and Anthony called Dane Cook a "sellout," which they denied, leading to a discussion about Cook's audience and comedic sensibilities.  Bob Kelly was also derisively called a "sellout."  The Forbes list of top-earning deceased celebrities, with Kurt Cobain surpassing Elvis, was analyzed, with speculation about the sources of their income.  Steve C. performed a hostage negotiation skit, and listener calls were interspersed.  The segment concluded with promotion of Jimmy Norton's stand-up gigs, discussion of potential blizzard travel issues, and mention of upcoming guests Jim Belushi and Sharon Osbourne, along with promotion of their merchandise and FHM magazine. The show ended with repeated jokes about large breasts and a "Line of the Day" announcement.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the O.P. and Anthony show on XM202 featuring O.P., Anthony, and James Norton.  It's different.  The infection was everywhere.  It was in the street outside.  It was coming through your windows.  It was a virus.  Terrible viral infection gives people this incurable disease.  Fills their veins and blood with their pure rage.  By the time they tried to evacuate the cities, it was already too late.  Jesus Christ, five hours?  It infects, replicates, and kills this fast?  These numbers can't be right.  The numbers are correct.  I wish to God they weren't. 
[00:00:30]  It's that one.  There is no God.  It's like some kind of horror movie.  It's such a great virus that you want to infect others like your friends and coworkers.  Sometimes it leaves pustules.  There's nothing you can do about it.  God Almighty.  You've got to stop this outbreak before it mutates.  They're highly contagious.  What's this rash from?  We're facing a new strain.  It can cause life-threatening bleeding or even asphyxiation.  Where is it spreading?  All over the place.  All right.  We're coming out.  Here we go. 
[00:01:00]  I'm a boredom.  Anthony.  I'm a little dirty.  Wipe me.  James Norton.  Boom.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Cardinals win game three. 
[00:01:30]  Lead series two to one.  Who saw that coming?  Kurt Cobain is top-earning deceased celebrity.  Still making cash.  Beating out Elvis.  Beating out Elvis for the first time.  Elvis was always the guy that made the big bucks.  And that stupid baby Einstein.  Yeah.  Go figure that one out.  I didn't know.  I was shocked. 
[00:02:00]  Coming in on the top five dead celebrity earners is Albert Einstein.  He's in the top five.  I'm like, what the hell could he?  What are their little E equals MC squared shops set up all over the place?  I mean, how could Einstein be making money?  Another headline to start the Opie and Anthony show.  Someone has bad breath after we get off the air.  Oh, God.  What?  What?  Oh, smell this. 
[00:02:30]  They don't know the...  Smell it, Jimmy.  Oh, boy.  Smell it.  They don't know the...  What do we do?  See, over at XM, they sterilize our mics and...  Oh, my God.  You are really obsessing with sniffing on it, too.  Get some Lysol on it.  How's yours?  Here, smell mine.  No, I got a mouthful of food.  Oh, my God.  You're going to vomit.  Smell.  Smell.  I love how Opie knows not even to ask me. 
[00:03:00]  Oh, God.  It smells like every comedy microphone.  What is up with this?  Usually this is fine, man.  You know, they really ought to...  Well, yeah, that's good enough.  They ought to do some kind of a...  One of those little bacteria things on the mic  to check the bacteria that's on a microphone. 
[00:03:30]  The radio mics and, like Jimmy said,  imagine what the mic...  How many clubs has it in?  What?  I'm saying, imagine...  Sorry.  Imagine what those mics have in it.  They're perfect.  They're like...  It's a screen.  So, crap gets in there  and then it's dark behind the screen  and moist  and things can just grow there and fester.  And I knew a comic,  for one of her bits,  she would put the whole microphone in her mouth. 
[00:04:00]  Oh, I've seen that, you know...  Size Queen?  Kind of like that, yeah.  Chick bit where she can, you know, do that.  Why would she do that?  Some chick comic.  Because she can't be funny  just doing regular stuff.  That's why.  So it's like show  that you can shove a microphone in your mouth.  That's right.  All right.  At different clubs,  it's different.  She's just shoving that mic in her mouth.  Oh, my God.  Mic's stink is disgusting.  You might as well just pull someone out of the audience  and use the real thing.  You get less germs.  We're doing good now.  Is that good now?  Yeah.  Maybe someone had an onion or something. 
[00:04:30]  Here, Rock.  Yeah, give me the Lysol.  I think...  All right.  I'm not even going to...  I'm not even going to try mine.  I'm just going to spray it.  All right.  Back to the show.  Wow.  Subway flasher.  Arrested again.  Watch your cereal, Jimmy.  Girl attacked because she deleted her ex-boyfriend from MySpace page.  She was attacked?  1,600 New York City sexual predators to be monitored on Halloween. 
[00:05:00]  Tomcat wedding in Italy.  Coming soon.  Is Halloween that bad with sexual predators that that's the day that they pick?  Why don't they just pick a random day of the week during the year?  That seems to be when things just happen.  You know, you'd make a really good point.  Yeah, nothing happens on the days where they think things are going to happen.  Yeah, here in New York City, 1,600 predators.  Right.  Right.  Why are you watching them on Halloween?  They're even smart enough to hang low.  On Halloween. 
[00:05:30]  They're even smart enough to turn all the lights off in their house  and just crawl into the fetal position and wait for Halloween to be over.  That's the bad day.  Like we're on high alert every 9-11 now.  That's not the day.  No.  That's not the day anymore.  It'll be some other day.  It's going to be some other day.  And that Halloween is probably the day that the parents  are taking the most vulnerable of children out with them.  Right.  You know?  You get the kids out there with their parents trick-or-treating. 
[00:06:00]  They're more supervised on that day than any other day.  But that's the one they pick.  The predators.  Well, it's part of the whole culture of fear.  Yeah.  We love the culture of fear.  We should be on high alert as far as Halloween stories on the news.  Yep.  This is the season, man.  They come right at you.  Come right at you.  Scaring you.  About tainted candy and pins and apples and razor blades and apples.  Man, if you bite into an apple and you bite into a razor blade, 
[00:06:30]  you're one of those little baby turtles that wasn't supposed to make it to the ocean.  Yeah.  You really...  If you can't figure out by looking at an apple that it might have a problem...  Hey, what's with the...  Why is there...  Why is there...  Slots in my apple that are turning brown?  Right.  What is that?  If you're that stupid, you know what?  Bite away.  We don't need you on this planet.  The only difference is a little baby turtle was never molested on his way to the water by  a big turtle.  Well, how do you know?  How do you know? 
[00:07:00]  We don't speak baby turtle, Jimmy.  How do we really know for sure?  Little shy turtle.  I can't remember any of his turtle childhood.  More headlines for today.  Woman has twins.  One black, one white.  Stop.  Explain that.  She must have had sex with two men very close together.  She's ovulating.  And would have been... 
[00:07:30]  And fertilized two different eggs.  Yeah.  Could be.  We'll get into the story in a little bit.  How else that would happen?  Maybe God just doesn't know if he likes her or not.  Here's another good one.  Woman wants plastic surgery to become...  Huh?  Uglier.  Really?  She's too hot?  Yeah.  She deems herself too hot?  Just a hassle walking down the street.  What is she a distraction to everything?  She's a danger?  She's going to sacrifice herself? 
[00:08:00]  Oh, get over it.  Oh, I love this world.  It's so stupid.  Gotta love a stupid world.  All right.  I want to say hi to everybody listening to us all over the world, Anthony.  Of course.  On the internet.  I want to say hi to everyone listening to us on XM.  I want to say hi to everyone listening to us on regular radio.  Commercial radio.  Frequency modulation and amplitude modulation.  Welcome.  Welcome.  And we're also on DirecTV on one of their channels. 
[00:08:30]  Of course.  We're all over the place.  Welcome.  A worldwide, a global audience.  All right.  Just in case you missed it last night, I just can't stay up for the World Series, and I  would love to.  No.  Is Missouri starting to piss you off?  I'm not going to call them St. Louis.  No, it's Missouri.  Harden Hills or anything.  No, it's just...  We hate the whole state.  It's that team from Missouri.  God, do we hate Missouri.  Because let's remember, no matter how big the city sounds when you say the city's name, 
[00:09:00]  just put it in context of what state they're in.  They're in Missouri.  Kansas City.  Cool.  Yeah, Kansas City sounds cool.  Where are you going?  Kansas City.  That's right.  Oh, where is that?  That's right.  Hallelujah.  It's in Missouri.  Right.  Missouri.  You know what they do to a woman in Missouri that has twins, one black and one white?  Oh, well, let me tell you.  They want to hear about it.  They don't want to hear nothing about it. 
[00:09:30]  They want to keep their whiteness.  50-50 where it counts.  In the womb.  This buxotic.  Mondo shameless.  All right.  Yeah, just in case you missed it.  Sorry, Detroit.  We're pulling for you, man.  Yeah, what's going on?  We are pulling for you.  Yeah, but just in case you missed it, because the game ended at, I think, 1.15 in the morning.  And again, you don't have to watch it. 
[00:10:00]  Huh?  Nah.  You don't have to watch the whole game.  We sum it up for you right here.  Yeah.  Here's the World Series.  Yeah.  That's it.  Edmonds grounds it fair.  Pass first down the right field line.  Two runs are going to score.  Belliard is held at third.  Edmonds has delivered for St. Louis 2-0.  Not every hit is a mistake, but this is a mistake by Robertson. 
[00:10:30]  Yeah, see?  Yeah.  What was the final score last night?  Was it 5-zip?  But it was a tough one, right?  This is the last call of the game.  Tonight it is Looper closing it in a non-save situation after Carpenter did his thing for eight innings.  The third for Rowland.  The St. Louis Cardinals have taken game three of the World Series and lead it two games to one.  Oh, boy.  Who saw that coming?  Two games to one?  Oh, boy. 
[00:11:00]  I think we'll see seven games.  Yeah?  Yeah, I think so.  I'd like to see that.  That would be exciting.  This just in.  Imus just flashed his Opie and Anthony Wow t-shirt on MSNBC.  He's celebrating Whip-A-Bow Wednesday.  Let's say hi to Doug in Los Angeles.  Doug, what's up?  Is this the Cake Smasher?  We'll get into that in a little while.  You know, half our audience has no idea about the Cake Smashing.  Dirty Cake Smasher.  That's just how it works when you do these two radio shows every day.  Yeah, I saw it like 20 minutes ago. 
[00:11:30]  It's great.  It's going to be up on YouTube very, very soon, the video.  It's already there.  It is?  Yeah.  Under what?  Opie and Anthony Cake Smashing or Cake Stomping or something like that?  Yes, sir.  All right.  We'll talk about that in a little bit.  What's up, Doug?  I'm calling to promote Wow Whip-A-Bow Wednesday.  Are you listening to us on XM, the Internet, DirecTV?  XM.  XM.  Very nice.  All right.  And you're a big fan of the Whip-A-Bow Wednesday?  I am.  It works in L.A., believe it or not.  All right.  Explain it to the new listeners. 
[00:12:00]  You've got to be fast and interesting here.  Well, I'll stand for Whip-A-Bow Wednesday.  And you're basically showing your support for the show.  You get a nice treat if you're nice about it.  You don't want to rat the ladies.  Put a wow sticker on your car right in the dirt of your truck if you're too poor to get a sticker.  And drive around.  And eventually, you know what happens.  What happens?  You get to see some nice ones.  Some nice boobies?  Yeah.  I think you can still say boobies on a regular radio. 
[00:12:30]  I would hope so.  That's pretty harmless work.  It's a little wild out here, but it's always been fatty, so.  By the way.  It's still a treat.  By the way, I got an email from the program director at the San Francisco station.  Okay.  And even though we've only been on a little bit, he's noticing a buzz already and growth  in the ratings.  But I also want to thank him for probably the smallest wow sticker ever made.  Is it just a tiny little bumbelina size?  Do we still have him?  Jimmy brought him back from L.A. 
[00:13:00]  He had him in his wallet, and he didn't have to fold him.  Look at this thing.  Look at this thing.  It looks like a Barbie camper.  Wait, what is it?  I can't see it.  Exactly.  Thanks for committing to our Whip Him Out Wednesday campaign, San Francisco.  That is really, really funny.  What the hell are you supposed to do with this?  I don't know.  You put that on, like, the little electric cars that you give the kids for Christmas.  Here's the deal with Whip Him Out Wednesday.  Yes, it has to be big enough on the bumper so the girls can see the wow and then flash.  Yeah.  Look at how small the name of the station is on there.  That's just so they don't get crap from the women's groups out there. 
[00:13:30]  You can't see that.  They don't want to commit.  Unless you're right on someone's bumper.  San Francisco is too scared to commit to our Whip Him Out Wednesday campaign.  Come on, Sam Fran.  The 106.9 is in red.  It's not that easy to see.  I mean, they don't want women's groups to get pissed off.  If that was on a car, you absolutely couldn't see it.  Now, as opposed to the BCN sticker which Opie is holding up, the whole top of it is BCN 104.1. 
[00:14:00]  It's a mini wow sticker.  Oh, look.  Oh, it's so adorable.  It's only for flat-chested girls.  Come on, San Francisco.  Help us out a little bit.  They're very afraid out there.  It's amazing the power of special interest groups have in San Francisco.  I was like, could you guys relax?  I was talking to the guy who dumps it out of the show where he edits the racial content.  I'm like, dude, if someone gets mad, who cares?  Who's making that decision?  I don't know.  I would like to know.  Oh, boy.  Are they getting a call from Joel Hollander? 
[00:14:30]  Oh, are they getting a call from Joel Hollander?  I think Joel Hollander in the end decides what they should be dumping out of.  You know, it's bad enough that you've got the language thing and you can't use certain words and stuff,  but it's gotten to the point where, especially in places like San Francisco,  it's so culturally diverse that they are really infringing on the freedom of speech.  It's absolutely an infringement on the freedom of speech. 
[00:15:00]  It's not even a question.  You can question the use of foul language as freedom of speech because it's been in the courts and what is obscenity?  They can't quite figure it out, so they've got to skirt this gray area with the FCC.  But political commentary, political correctness, racial commentary, sexual commentary on sexual preference,  things like that, not graphic sexual content. 
[00:15:30]  That is fair game.  That is something that is given to you.  It is a right.  It is a right.  They're terrified of Asian people.  It's terrified of Asian people.  Absolutely.  Well, what if the Asians get mad?  I don't know.  What if they do?  What if they do?  What if anybody gets mad at anything that's done?  Is there such a big problem?  Has a boycott really ever worked?  Or has the threat of a boycott done enough damage that companies just buckle, they fold up and just quit and fire people and stuff? 
[00:16:00]  Can't we just have someone with a set on them that can look and say, you know something?  Listen, this is a freedom of speech issue.  Yeah, we don't agree with what they're saying.  You might not agree with what they're saying.  It might make you angry.  But they absolutely have the right to say it.  It doesn't fall under any FCC issues.  So, sorry. 
[00:16:30]  They have the right.  But no, they just would rather go, hey, look, guys, guys, you're treading in some dangerous area.  Why?  Because we're just talking.  They dumped out of a – this is how I found out when I got there to do – I was doing the show that was on at night.  Two guys that were – they're really new to the market.  And, you know, so I stopped in and do their show.  I'm talking to a guy.  And he goes, yeah, I'm in charge.  He's a young dude.  I think he's just following directive, obviously.  He goes, yeah, I'm in charge of kind of cleaning up your show and dumping out of, like, all the extreme racial content. 
[00:17:00]  And I'm thinking, like, we do racial jokes, but what extreme content do we have?  There's no extreme content.  He goes, like, that Barack Obama joke he did today.  I did a Barack Obama joke.  You mentioned him last week or something.  I said something about Barack Obama.  He's dark but not criminally so.  Not the greatest line, but not anything that should be dumped out of on a radio show.  That's funny because it's a stereotype.  It's a funny joke on the stereotype of it, on the way it's portrayed in the news, on the fear in America. 
[00:17:30]  Why can't you say that?  I went crazy when I found out he dumped out of that.  Like, why would you – that is the absolute –  Yes.  If someone had said the same line on something like Air America, if anybody was listening to Air America, but if they had said the same line but used it in a way that was trying to show how racist people are, oh, black, but not criminally black, like put in that context, that would have skated through completely unscathed. 
[00:18:00]  Absolutely.  But use it in humor?  Supposed to be the free speech capital.  All right.  What happened, man?  What happened?  That's where the hippie movement started, man.  Come on, man.  Free speech, man.  Look at what you've all turned into.  A bunch of whining, politically correct parents.  You become the parents.  Got to make sure.  Oh, you got to look over the children. 
[00:18:30]  Make sure they don't say anything that's going to upset anybody.  What happened to the free speech?  What about you hypocrites?  What happened to hairy armpits?  Right.  What?  Dirty feet.  And women doing acid and hearing hot dogs scream.  Come on.  All right.  Well, let's just put it this way.  The wow stickers are tiny.  Tiny.  Tiny.  It's not even tiny.  It's teeny tiny.  It's teeny tiny.  I don't want to upset anybody with the wow sticker.  I don't think we should put that.  Somebody might not like it.  I'm upset it.  So the Asians might get upset. 
[00:19:00]  You could turn it upside down and say, Mom, no, what if it's a family with two dads?  That's right.  That's offensive, too.  Know what that tells me?  That they're sort of happy that we're in San Francisco.  Sort of.  They're happy, but sort of.  Sort of happy.  Like, okay, they got this wow thing.  All right.  All right, we'll join the wow movement, but in our own safe way, you're not going to get  a wow sticker that tiny in Philadelphia.  Let me tell you that.  Do they have a stock of, like, stickers that get a little bigger, depending on how popular 
[00:19:30]  we get there?  Like, the ratings go up again, the sticker gets a little bigger?  Just a little bigger?  That's probably what they're going to do.  The visibility of the station is a little bigger?  Yeah.  Well, didn't Adam Carolla have a problem?  It might have been in L.A. where he says I'm at Asians, and they got upset, and he apologized.  I don't know if he apologized, I heard he did.  He did the stereotypical Asian imitation voice, which seems to be very politically incorrect  to do.  Well, how come it's fine if Margaret Cho is making fun of it, and her mother?  Why is that fine if that fan is making fun of it? 
[00:20:00]  Oh, because he is.  So freedom of speech, if you are that, if you're yellow, you can make fun of the yellows.  If you're black, you can make fun of the blacks.  If you're white, mind your P's and Q's with the language, mister.  Yeah, because there really isn't...  That's so true.  If you're just a regular white guy, you're screwed, because you can't...  There's no real regular white guy jokes.  No.  It's not really, because it's like, you know, milk toast boring, you're supposed to just...  Are we really screwed, though?  No.  What do you get when you cross one white guy?  Well, not behind closed doors with each other. 
[00:20:30]  Are we really screwed?  What do you get when you cross one white guy with the other?  I don't know, but I bet property value is good.  Two white guys walk into a bar, they have a beverage.  Enjoy themselves without fighting or killing each other.  That's right.  There's no violence.  They sip martinis and tip well.  And then they drive fine on the way home.  Not in the left lane doing 20 miles an hour.  When I walk back to my really white, upper class neighborhood, the first thought I have  is, man, we're really screwed. 
[00:21:00]  Got to tell you.  Maybe I shouldn't have put it quite in that way.  Not in those stereotypical jokes anymore.  Yeah.  Yeah, right.  But we are...  Can't teach other.  White people are also stereotyped.  Like, you know what I mean?  Like, a lot of times black people are stereotyped.  Fine.  I understand that.  Arabs certainly have to deal with it.  Middle Eastern people.  Yeah.  But white people, every time there's a good deed to have someone go, must be the work  of a white man.  Right.  Every time there's sunshine, look at that.  White people's influence again.  Sometimes it's not.  It's a burden.  It is.  Tell me about it.  To be so good.  Tell me about it.  You know something? 
[00:21:30]  A lot of the great inventions around the world.  Stupid whitey.  That's right.  Coming up with that.  But we can't claim anything having to do with the peanut.  Thank you.  One of my favorite foods, by the way.  George Washington Carver, a black gentleman.  I love the black man.  Everything to do with the peanut.  He studied that goddamn peanut.  He certainly did.  He dedicated his life to the peanut and squeezing out a thousand patents out of a peanut.  What a horrible life he had, just looking at that rotten little nut. 
[00:22:00]  Oh, what can I do now?  I've gotten oil out of it.  Made some kind of paste.  Right.  You spread on bread.  That's how pathetic we are, though.  Every other food was invented.  It was like, white man, the white guy was like, ah, what can we do with this piece of crap?  You just eat a peanut.  Leave it to Blackie to figure it out.  To Blackie.  What?  Say that?  You think that's how he said it?  Oh, yeah.  Back then, white man.  The big conspiracy.  Yeah, of course.  How many things did he try with the peanut that didn't work?  Like, everybody built a peanut house. 
[00:22:30]  It just didn't catch on.  He had a peanut house.  It just smelled like nuts.  It was like an awful house.  He could grind it up, make it into peanut lumber, and then just make it, but it just  smells like peanut.  Or peanut brittle.  He made himself a vehicle out of peanut brittle.  A rickshaw.  He was pulled in a peanut brittle rickshaw.  It just didn't catch on.  All right, listen.  We're getting silly now.  Failed works.  Hey.  George Washington Carver.  So it's Whip Him Out Wednesday.  We've got a break.  So don't forget. 
[00:23:00]  Get a wow sticker on your car.  Get a wow sign on your car.  This has been going on for, wow, almost a decade now.  Wow.  Almost a decade, probably a decade, ten years, the girls have been flashing us on the highways  when they see those wow signs and those wow stickers.  Ladies, thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  It's Whip Him Out Wednesday on the Opie and Anthony Show.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  When we get back, we have a Jerry Springer update.  Uh-oh.  I think they finally have acknowledged that we're keeping him on the show.  Really? 
[00:23:30]  They didn't mention us by name, but we got some audio that's pretty funny.  We'll get into the cake stomp thing again today.  We got a lot to do.  We got to still figure it all out.  So stay there.  I came up with something years ago.  Basically, it says,  Whip Him Out Wednesday.  Big, luscious, juicy ones.  Wow.  The swinging tribute to unrestrained female anatomy.  It's Whip Him Out Wednesday.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Hear what everyone else is talking about.  ONA Uncut and live.

[00:25:00]  Let's say hi to Joanne in New York.  Joanne, what's up?  Hi.  I was just wondering.  I never hear you make fun of Jewish people.  Is it because your boss is Jewish and you get fired?  Wow.  No, no, Joanne, you're wrong.  Joanne.  You make fun of that all the time.  We're constantly goofing on everybody.  You've never heard.  Everybody about white people?  Everyone hears selectively.  Who do you make fun of?  Jewish people, have you ever heard me talk about my neighborhood that I live in?  Okay, your neighbor is Jewish.  Have you ever heard me? 
[00:25:30]  Have you ever heard the goofs that go along with me collecting Nazi memorabilia  and I live in an entire Jewish neighborhood and the jokes that...  Hey, sweetheart, why are you talking over everyone?  We're letting you get your point across.  We're explaining something and you're just babbling.  Now, have you never heard all of the jokes we have made about that?  The jokes that Jimmy comes out with about how Jews on the media and stuff like,  you know, those stereotypes, we goof on that.  You've never heard that?  No.  Really?  We do it all the time.  You're a selective listener. 
[00:26:00]  Yeah, you choose not to hear that part of our show.  You only hear what affects you.  You especially make fun of black people.  Especially.  Really?  Especially?  Especially, but that's what you hear.  You're especially hearing that.  That guy, Jim, whatever his name is, a little rat.  That's me.  Wait a minute.  Is there a plug coming up?  No, no, don't play yourself.  That's me.  Another thing you need to understand is, I don't want to listen to your bull crap.  Then turn off the radio.  No, I can't, because unfortunately, I'm engaged to a fucking white man. 
[00:26:30]  You're what?  You're engaged to a white man.  You're crap.  All right, so just.  Hold on, hold on, because she just cursed and he just kicked out.  Of course, you cursed.  Black people don't want you.  Joanne is a, you're black, right, Joanne?  No, I'm not.  I'm orange.  You're orange?  So you're half and half?  So you're sort of black?  No, I'm black.  How black, though?  Because even in the black community, it matters.  How black is your mother?  Try harder, bitch!  Yeah.  Yeah, okay.  That's the best you have. 
[00:27:00]  We let you say what you wanted to say.  Here's the bottom line.  Why don't you do this?  Why don't you call up 97 or 107.5?  No, I don't listen to that.  Okay, why don't you shut up and let somebody else talk?  Your white husband needs to really do it, because you're a yapper.  She needs to have her eye whitened.  And you pay me back, so whatever.  Ah, shut up, stupid.  What I love, you know what I love?  Just pay attention and keep laughing at the jokes.  Can I say what I love?  Yeah, what do you love?  I love how you guys hide your racism behind jokes.  Yeah, we love the way your husband buries his bone in you and then tells his friends,  look, I can't help it, she's a great bang. 
[00:27:30]  That's what white people are good for.  Yeah.  Yeah, why are you marrying one then, stupid?  We hide it like Ralphie Mae behind a sapling.  Hold on, hold on, what'd you say, stupid?  Joanne, what'd you say?  Your mother's stupid.  Right, right, but she's not calling a radio show.  We get it, we're in third grade again, we get it.  No, dumb hole, dumb hole, why are you marrying a white guy if white people are so bad?  Yeah.  He's not as bad as you are.  You just answered when I said, hey, dumb hole.  You know how happy that makes me?  White people are full of crap.  Keep listening.  Really?  Just keep listening. 
[00:28:00]  Yes.  Keep listening.  Hey, Joanne, why don't you test your own racism?  Thanksgiving's coming, right?  Thank you, yeah.  When you're all sitting around that table, why don't you take a real close look at their  eyes?  Why don't you take a real close look at their eyes?  Why don't you really, really do your own experiment when you're with the extended family at Thanksgiving,  take a real good look at their eyes.  You're going to see a lot.  Well, they could be racist, I don't give a damn.  You're going to see a lot. 
[00:28:30]  And I'm sure your family is thrilled too, Joanne.  He brought a what to Thanksgiving dinner?  Joanne, you're listening very selectively.  Yeah, sure I am.  Turn it off, that stupid.  Especially.  Jokes you guys make are hurtful, and you're stupid.  Ah, shut up, you...  If you're funny, I'll give it to you.  No, you wouldn't.  Joanne, turn it off, you dumb brood.  Joanne, you're proving our point.  We're getting people to listen.  You hate us so much, but you have to listen every day.  Yes, you do.  That's our job.  Don't you get it?  You have to listen.  And there are plenty of people... 
[00:29:00]  Why do you have to listen to us?  Because my fiancé listens to us.  Good for him.  He's a good boy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Except for that one problem he has.  Except for that one mistake.  That issue he has.  Yeah, that's it.  Why do you have to listen?  Because he listens.  Because he puts it so damn loud.  Well, then why don't you have some kind of cohesive relationship and tell him,  I don't want to hear that.  It bothers me.  Or does he just do what he does?  He says, shut up and leave the room.  And you know why he keeps the radio so loud?  Because he doesn't want to hear you babbling.  Babble, babble, babble, babble.  Here she goes again. 
[00:29:30]  Babble, babble, babble, babble.  Wow.  Babble, babble, babble, babble, babble, babble.  I bet that head's going back and forth.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  I bet her head's going back and forth while she's talking.  Listen, you're the dumb broad stuck in a marriage or a relationship.  You're the gay bastard I have to listen to.  Stop yelling.  You're the dumb broad who's with somebody that doesn't listen to her.  Gay bastards I have to listen to.  Gay bastards?  Yeah.  That's the best you have, broad who has no influence in her own relationship?  Why don't you do what you're supposed to?  Go cook them something and then drop to your knees, dumb broad, because that's what you do. 
[00:30:00]  Honey, I don't like this show.  Shut up.  Who pays the rent?  That's what you do, stupid.  Don't call us because you have no influence in your loveless home.  Yeah, we go scrub the toilet.  Rich Voss is on this show on a regular basis.  We make fun of his Jewish-um.  Jewish-um.  Jewish-um?  Jewish-um all the time.  She gets back at the fiancée, though, by spitting in his mint julep. 
[00:30:30]  See, this is what this guy has to hear.  She hasn't stopped talking.  Babble, babble, babble, babble, babble, babble.  No one listens to you, stupid.  Babble, babble, babble, babble, babble, babble, babble.  He's a house nigger.  That's what he is.  Who is?  Patrice Neal.  Oh, Patrice is not.  First of all, she called him Patrice Neal.  She raises a good point about that.  Patrice Neal.  Wait.  He comes with Jimmy and his jokes?  Wait, what did you call him?  Patrice what?  A house nigger.  No, no, no.  What?  No, stupid.  His last name.  O'Neal, whatever the hell his name is.  Yeah, whatever. 
[00:31:00]  You know exactly what his name is.  The beautiful thing is this.  You are in a relationship where you have no influence on what goes on in your own home.  Oh, yeah.  Influence.  He wants to listen to it.  He was listening to your bowl before I got with him.  You're a toilet scrubber.  Go scrub the toilet like a good, submissive wife.  Go scrub the bowl.  There's probably a ring in that bowl, and he's not going to like it.  No, bitch.  We have a maid.  Lang, of course you do, and he's marrying it.  You're a toilet scrubber.  Okay.  You're never going to win this one, you babbler. 
[00:31:30]  You're a dick sucker.  You're white.  That's ew.  That's ew.  Oh, no, you didn't.  No, no, you didn't.  No, you didn't.  You are such a racist, Joanne.  You are a complete racist.  I am, but I'll admit it.  What about you?  You're marrying a white guy?  Hey, stupid Joanne, yesterday on the show, I admitted that I'm a racist.  I admitted that the whole country has some racism in them.  No, I said we're doomed as a nation.  We're all racist.  We're doomed as a nation because of racism in this country.  We all got a little racism in us, and we got a little hypocrisy in us. 
[00:32:00]  We're all white sheet racist.  Hey, stupid.  White sheet racist.  How did your father react?  How did your parents react when you told me you were marrying a white guy?  Honestly.  They didn't care.  You just said everybody's a racist.  How can we be a racist?  Hey, you ought to be subdued.  That's mom.  Here's mom reacting.  When the cops came over.  And here's dad.  Shut up.  There's white men laughing.  You wait until we're done laughing before you talk.  He finds it funny because he's white. 
[00:32:30]  He has his DNA, so he finds it funny.  I find it with talk.  You're going to have to look at those blue eyes for the rest of your stupid life.  Those blue devil eyes staring to him.  That's right.  That's right.  Don't marry the guy if you have a lie.  I hope this radio show breaks up your relationship there.  You know what I hope?  What do you hope, baby?  Black nigger friends that you have finally see you for the racist pigs that you are.  Is that the best you have to insult your own people? 
[00:33:00]  You really are dumb.  You know why they're niggers?  Because they're friends with you.  You're dropping the N-bomb, and you're marrying a white man.  Boy, you're really a strong black woman.  Just stare into those blue eyes and tussle his blonde hair as you pump out a half-and-half.  Shut up.  Pump out a half-and-half.  Shut your face.  Half-and-half would make great models.  You give birth to another supermodel.  Throw that mochaccino over your back and burp it.  Okay.  Joanne, get lost.  Oh, shut up.  Yeah.  Get lost.  Just do what you do. 
[00:33:30]  Be a good, submissive wife.  I'll see you when you got fired.  You have no power in your own relationship.  She was so happy when we got fired.  She knows everything about our radio careers.  The bottom line is...  God, I got to tell you, man.  Star's got to get a gig in New York, man.  Yeah, I know.  These people need a place to go in the morning.  The bottom line is this.  You have no influence in your own...  Now you have to listen because you are babbling and dropping the N-bomb, which, believe me,  we don't like the fact that we can't say it on the show, but it's just one of those CBS things we can't say.  You probably got dumped at it, but she was saying,  he's a black N about Patrice. 
[00:34:00]  You're the one who's in a relationship you have no power in.  So do what you do.  If you're going to be that submissive that your fiancé won't turn down the radio for somebody that's really offending you,  then just be a maid.  Any woman.  If you can't have your fiancé respect your wishes, then just go clean the toilet and cook him dinner.  Be a good girl.  That's what you are.  You're a maid.  Unbelievable.  The people that call us out on being racist, and we do a lot of racial humor on this show.  It's based on stereotypes that have been around for years, and we do it because it's funny. 
[00:34:30]  Regardless of what the politically correct people say, racial humor, doesn't matter what race you're talking about, is funny.  It just is.  Why do you think the longevity of those jokes?  They're just goddamn funny.  But the people that call us up and call us out on being racist are so much more real racists than we are.  I mean, we're doing it in humor.  And in daily life, believe me, I'd like to continue the act, 
[00:35:00]  the actor that plays Anthony on the Opie and Anthony show, if I could borrow from Opie's bit.  But believe me.  Hey, hey, hey.  No one's buying into this.  It's not.  They're not?  No.  We all see what you're all about.  Okay.  It's actually a lot worse.  I was trying to actually make a point.  It's actually a lot worse when the mics are off.  Who are you kidding?  But I don't know.  The bottom line is it's such a politically correct society.  They're so used to white people who don't do any black humor at all.  Exactly.  You don't see it on TV.  They hear this and they go, what is it?  Wait a minute.  There's a room full of white guys and they're doing racial humor. 
[00:35:30]  That's right.  Oh, that's racist.  No, it's not.  It's called a comedy show.  Because no one's going to make us feel guilty.  And if you don't like it, don't listen.  If you think it's racist, don't listen.  But when you call up, you come off sounding more racist than anybody.  Did you hear her?  White devil, sheet, white sheet racists.  What?  We're in the Klan now?  She could say that.  But yet if we turn around and really turn it around and call her the equivalent of that, 
[00:36:00]  as far as black people go, we're done.  Well, she was calling Patrice again.  They probably dumped out of it.  XM heard it.  That black, just because he's comfortable on the street.  House end.  House end.  And the funny thing is, as much as I'd love to smash Patrice, because who doesn't want  to embarrass one of their friends?  Of course.  That's the last thing he is.  That's the last thing he is.  And she's waiting for our black friends to turn on us.  Actually, a loving person is the last thing he is.  But a house end is the second to last thing he is.  Let's go to Derek, who's calling from New Jersey.  Derek. 
[00:36:30]  Hey, what up?  What color are you?  I am of the African descent, damn it.  Well, listen.  Everybody needs to stop being so sensitive.  I love you guys.  And Anthony, you nailed it.  It is comedy and it's funny.  It's just...  It's hilarious.  That's what keeps me listening.  And you guys are edgy.  You know, you take it to that edge.  Sometimes you're even going overboard.  But hey, so what?  Hey, Derek.  Why do you guys get uppity?  That girl was.  Well, the thing is this.  If you know where it's coming from, it's like if you know it's not coming from a place 
[00:37:00]  of people who are being honestly hateful, then anything is acceptable.  As long as you know where it's coming from and the intent of it.  That intent is everything.  If we were sitting here honestly and being hateful and inciting, that's one thing.  This is all done on a stupid comedy radio show, you dope.  And then they call up to complain and argue about it and come off being the racist that  is dangerous.  But we get...  It's not just like whether it's black people or Jews or any other... 
[00:37:30]  We get women to call, you guys are sexist pigs, you're this and you're a pig.  And just the great part about her call is she was so angry that she wasn't going to  get her way.  It's like, no, we heard you.  We don't care about what you said.  Now go back into your influence-less relationship.  She doesn't have...  Bye, Derek.  Thank you, Derek.  Let's go to Jennifer in New York City.  I have a word to say in that relationship of hers.  Jennifer.  I love her.  I love the guy she's marrying to.  I bet you he doesn't see this militant side of her. 
[00:38:00]  I bet he'll hear this and go, that's what I've been banging.  Is that...  Wow.  That's the way she feels.  That's very exciting, though, huh?  Yeah, of course it is.  She'll look you right in the eye.  She's going to give him a good one later, an angry one.  Yeah, angry one.  All right, let's go to Jennifer.  Hey.  Hey, Jennifer.  Hey.  Listen, I'm a new listener and I just wanted to make a couple of comments.  Your name stinks.  It's not necessarily a bad thing.  On one hand, it's complimentary.  I don't really know you guys and just like your history of where you're coming from.  So, I can only, as of so far, decide that either you are such talented comedians and just have such precise satire. 
[00:38:30]  That's it.  And the room, you're just like too hip for the room.  So, people are, you know, taking your stuff at face value and literally either that's happening or you're really, really racist.  I mean, what...  Wow.  Well, you have to, listen, when it comes to comedy, I know what you're saying, like, how could they be putting on a character that's so accurate?  Any type of humor you do, it's like, do we really think that cancer is good or that age is good?  Well, I think you hit the nail totally on the nose in the sense that when you said that everything racist is, you know, if it's done in a comical fashion, it's funny. 
[00:39:00]  I think it's all about the source that it's coming from.  So, if people, like, I'm kind of getting a better sense of who you guys are, but until I, you know, understand really what your ideas are, I was kind of thinking, well, I don't know.  Where are, is this funny?  Is it satire?  Are these people really, do they believe me?  People aren't used to hearing a room full of white guys talk about race.  Not anymore.  It's just, they, it just breathes outrage. 
[00:39:30]  People get outraged by hearing it.  Well, it's a hot topic issue, I mean.  But by the same token, honestly, I mean, you have to be able to understand why this type of material sets people off.  I mean, we can't deny that.  Well, you know.  Why should it?  Why should other races be able to lambast their own race and other races?  And white people are just up for grabs by any race.  A comic can get up on stage if they're Asian or black or Hispanic and just rail white people with impunity. 
[00:40:00]  And their own race.  I mean, you know, listen to Carlos's act.  Carlos Mencia.  He just rips apart the Hispanic community.  Black comedians.  Chris Rock, one of the funniest friggin' things he ever did was how he just bashed the hell out of black people.  Why is that accepted?  Well, I think it's accepted generally for people to, you know, completely speak about the group that they're from. 
[00:40:30]  And you get a free pass no matter what.  But why, though?  But you also get a free pass talking about other groups.  Well, that's a problem.  I mean, that's a problem.  No, I agree.  Listen, I don't have a problem with it.  I love it.  It's hysterical.  I just would like to be able to participate without the grief.  Well, it's just kind of in terms of being a human being, you know, and sharing this world with each other.  We've got to be a little sensitive.  No, we've got to turn into Vulcans and not have any emotion or humor or anything.  That's ridiculous. 
[00:41:00]  Hold on, Joanne, Joanne, Joanne.  Wait, wait, wait.  Jennifer.  I'm sorry, Jennifer.  What you said, we have to be sensitive.  Okay, understandable.  But why is it so considered so insensitive when you're addressing things in humor?  Like, that's the problem I have.  It's like, why should we have to worry about somebody being hypersensitive?  Well, hypersensitive is different, but sensitive in the sense that until it's obvious to everybody that's interpreting what you're saying that you guys are not legitimately of that belief, once people understand that, you're basically free and clear to just, you know, you have the freedom to express your humorous, you know, interpretation. 
[00:41:30]  I know what you mean.  Jennifer, hold on.  It's not our responsibility to think for other people.  I don't care what they think.  Like, if people are laughing, when I'm laughing at something, I'm not wondering, well, gee, is the person really?  You can kind of judge somebody's intent.  There you go, judging their intent.  You can pretty much do that with common – we all have that kind of common sense.  If somebody steps on your foot and says, excuse me, and then if somebody steps on your foot on purpose and says, excuse me, you know the difference, even though the words are the same. 
[00:42:00]  Right, right.  So we have that common experience.  The people who hear a comedy show know that we're goofing around.  They choose to get angry because people want to be self-righteous.  Well, gee, I think that that's the point in the sense that maybe that other chick that called – what was her name?  Joanne or something?  Maybe she's not familiar with your show.  As I said, I'm just beginning to get to know who you people are.  Getting to know you.  What?  But you're giving her too much credit.  Did you see what a phony she was?  Yeah.  How angry she really was? 
[00:42:30]  And how her racism came just blowing out of her head.  Yeah, definitely.  You know, I mean, there was a racist situation like reverse racism that she was, you know, exhibiting.  Not reverse racism.  It's just racism.  It was racism.  Let's just call it what it is.  It was definitely racism.  But the point being, you know, anybody gets a free pass to just rag on their own group because there's a general assumption, barring the idea that unless they're mentally ill or really are a self-hating type person, that you're not going to hate the group that you're in. 
[00:43:00]  Yeah.  When you're speaking about –  Well, we're not from that school of thought.  But thank you, Jennifer.  Bye.  And freedom of speech should have an answer.  Insightful.  Welcome to the show, Jennifer.  Very insightful debate.  All right.  On the subject.  And you'll listen and so on that dumb Joanne that called.  Of course.  Stupid Joanne.  I love it.  What song is he dancing to?  Oh, what are you talking about?  I just want to know what song he's dancing to.  You're not talking about the Michael J. Fox.  He's dancing to something. 
[00:43:30]  Well, on YouTube he is.  More by the day.  Oh, no.  Yeah, people have started putting this video to music.  Hey, man.  You're anti-parking.  I know.  Okay.  I want to apologize right now.  That's right.  I've stepped over the line.  And I'm sorry.  I guarantee you she never got offended in a room full of black guys making fun of white people.  As she shouldn't have.  Never once did that bother her.  She probably nodded her head and went, uh-huh.  All right.  Listen.  When we get back, we'll get into the cake stomping. 
[00:44:00]  We'll get into what they said about Jerry Springer.  Jerry Springer.  Yeah, you want to see some real hate?  You want to see some hate?  That's right.  That's not based on any form of comedy.  It's no comedy.  It's a complete tragedy.  The cake.  His lips, he looks like he's frozen to death.  Obama!  There he is!  Barack Obama.  He has purple lips.  I was on to this early.  He's freezing to death.  Cover of Time Magazine.  Obama!  Somebody get him some mittens.  You watch what Oprah does for Obama. 
[00:44:30]  You watch.  She's going to elect the next president all on her own.  Next president.  Good luck to you.  Obama!  We'll get into why Michael J. Fox was shaking so much.  Yeah.  And now, you know, people are having fun with the video on YouTube.  And, yeah, it looks like he really, really juiced it up for this political ad.  And I kind of, I'm on the fence on this one.  I'm completely on his side.  I just like because of what he was pushing. 
[00:45:00]  All right.  We'll get into it next.  It's the O.N.A. virus spreading across America.  The world.  The Opie and Anthony Fatty Pig Fatty Contest has been rejuvenated thanks to a visit from  a very girthy honey from Binghamton, New York, who tipped the scales at 505 pounds and obliterated  the competition.  But this doesn't mean there isn't someone larger who can't pry herself off the sofa,  hoist her barely breathing blubbery body up to our studios, and limp away with the grand prize. 
[00:45:30]  Remember, the heaviest girl at the end of the contest gets $10 for every memory-repressing,  artery-clogging pound on her body.  So if you spend more time upholstering your flesh with cupcakes than you do looking in a  mirror, sign up for the Opie and Anthony Fatty Pig Fatty Contest.  Details on opieandanthony.com.

[00:47:00]  That's 1-866-313-FREE.  Dancing with the Stars.  Dancing with the Stars.  We've been trying to influence this program.  I think the Pests have done a great job keeping Jerry Springer in.  Even though the judges try to vote him off every week, they're only 50% of the vote, the judges.  Yeah.  The other 50% comes from the viewing audience, of which the Pests are just pounding Jerry Springer  with votes, and it keeps him on.  Jerry doesn't even want to be on the show.  The judges don't want him on. 
[00:47:30]  The people boo when he wins every week after week after week.  He's begging for us to stop because his knees are killing him.  He's got to commute back from L.A. to Chicago to do his TV show.  He hates it.  And the Pests love it.  We love the fact that we're torturing Jerry Springer.  And now I guess he danced last night again.  We don't watch the show.  That's the beauty of this.  I don't watch the show.  We're keeping him on the show, but we're not even taking a peek.  And then I guess they vote, what, tonight? 
[00:48:00]  They've been voting.  They figure out who...  Where's Sam?  Sam has the update on Dancing with the Stars.  Sam's got the skinny on this.  Dancing with Stars.  The skinny.  Yeah, he said that...  What did you say before the show today, Sam, that Jerry looked ridiculous last night?  Yeah, he looked awful.  He looks ridiculous every night that he's dancing.  Complaining about his hips and his knees again because he physically is having trouble doing it.  They had to perform twice last night, so he had to do two dances.  Yeah.  And they were making a big deal about the fact that he doesn't know how to dance. 
[00:48:30]  He's not good at dancing, and he's not physically able to dance.  He's no kid, and his knees are bad, and his hips are bad.  He looks like a lame horse.  Yeah.  And the judges basically, when they went around, were just giving him credit for being able  to do it.  None of the...  That's good.  They specifically said, you're not as good as everybody else on the show.  They gave him a Special Olympics compliment.  Exactly.  Just for doing it.  Didn't they hint about it?  That he's being held hostage or something? 
[00:49:00]  Yeah.  The host actually said...  So it's basically the ballroom version of being held hostage or something like that  because they said that the fans won't let him leave.  Right.  Yeah.  And I guess you could still vote by going to abc.com.  Oh, keep Jerry in.  Keep him on.  By the way, our Halloween party is this coming Tuesday.  Yes.  Thank you, Booby Man from Brooklyn.  See, stupid me, I feel like it's still Tuesday when we do this radio show because it's so  goddamn early.  Yeah.  So you're right, Booby Man.  Next Tuesday night is the Halloween party, and we'll play it back on the radio a week from 
[00:49:30]  today, Wednesday.  There you go.  Here's Jerry Springer last night.  Okay.  You did it.  Two routines in a week.  I didn't think you were going to make it through, too, and you did a great job.  I think the first one, you didn't really have the hips going.  I think your arms were doing a little bit more of the action.  You're a joy to watch, but you're not quite on the same page as everybody else's level  in this competition.  Good job.  All right.  Land.  It's true.  Well, I'm almost going to say...  She's the Paula Abdul.  Huh?  Is she the Paula Abdul one on all these shows? 
[00:50:00]  You've got to have the same type of personalities behind the judges' table.  Well, God forbid you try something different, and it doesn't work.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  So they've got to do a carbon copy.  So she must have been the Paula Abdul type of judge, which just compliments you and says  it's good.  Even if you suck, at least you were trying.  And then...  She's the rah-rah.  Yeah.  The cheerleader for everybody.  Then who do they go to?  The limey.  Okay.  For you to attempt two dances that you've never done before in one week is... 
[00:50:30]  I take my hat off to you, but you've taken your own hat off.  Oh, look.  And, you know, I don't care if it's not up to the standard of the other guys.  I don't care.  Because you've brought so much joy and entertainment to this show.  I think you've done great.  All right.  And...  Well, Derek, after all of this, maybe you're ready for a vacation, are you?  But I don't think the public will let you go on vacation, because you're so entertaining.  In spite of all your shortcomings, obviously you're not Mario or Joey, but you just bring 
[00:51:00]  so much joy in the dance floor.  It's great to watch you.  You make us laugh.  It's great to have you.  Some people are laughing at him.  It's the ballroom equivalent of a hostage situation.  Why don't you...  Yeah.  Could I just, like, do comedy between the dances?  You could just...  Why don't you have that just to see what happens, you know?  You hold out hope.  I hate the fact they're all so encouraging.  It's just what's...  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's stupid.  He stinks, and he needs to go. 
[00:51:30]  Yeah, but please don't.  Don't.  Right, exactly.  Just keep voting.  Keep voting.  All right, well, that's going to be a 22 out of 30 for Jerry and Kim for their Latin.  They can say, no, they are, because they say wonderful things, and then they give me the  lowest score, which shows that they have integrity. 
[00:52:00]  Come on now.  All right, well, that's going to be a 22 out of 30 for Jerry and Kim for their Latin.  Now, their final total, over two weeks and three dances, is 64 out of 90.  90.  My day?  Thank you.  You did that well.  All right, if you haven't used up all your votes, and don't say, I didn't warn you, then  you need to pick up the vote and vote for them if you want to keep them out of the bottom,  too.  Oh, boy.  We're going to have a tough time.  I don't know about that.  Think it's going to be tough?  Yeah.  I don't know. 
[00:52:30]  I have faith in the pests.  Yeah?  They're very good.  The judges are 50%, but they also know if people are watching and everybody wants him  on, the judges are not the ones, the advertisers are looking to appease how many people want  to see him on.  Right.  So at least all those people who want to see him, they're going to keep him on.  The other scores are like in the 80s.  Really?  It's not even close.  It's not even close.  So we really need the pest to get out and vote.  Step it up.  Yeah, go to abc.com and vote for Jerry, okay?  By the way, Sam, you don't mind when we make fun of blacks, right? 
[00:53:00]  Mixed opinion.  No, I don't make it.  I don't mind.  That was like a Pat from Kunaki.  Oh, wow.  We're just trying to figure out what Sam is.  I think Sam is white.  He's a little, he's probably actually maybe he's black with white in him.  I don't know.  He's something.  What do you consider yourself?  I think white.  Okay.  You think?  I'd like to be.  Unless you're trying to get into college.  Hey.  Some financing. 
[00:53:30]  Might as well play that card, right?  Absolutely.  All right.  Thanks, Sam.  Thank you.  Sam's not black.  Sam's not black.  He's not black.  He doesn't have big lips.  He's just a real big thumb.  It's just a real big thumb.  Well, his skin's kind of weird.  It's not black or white. 
[00:54:00]  If he's white, then he's dark.  If he's black, he's light.  Who the hell can figure?  Who the hell can figure?  If Sam's white or a mm-mm.  White or a mm-mm.  Yeah, we're teasing, you know.  Because he's white with an afro.  Sam's not black.  He's not black.  Don't smoke crack.  He ain't black.  All right.  There you go.  Can we get into the cake stomping thing for a minute here? 
[00:54:30]  I was at lunch yesterday, and I was howling, trying to explain to a girl what is so great  about this.  Yeah.  And really is having a tough time with it.  It's horrifying.  A lot of people on the message boards having a tough time with this one, I noticed.  Of course not.  Yeah, they're kind of split down the middle on this one.  How could they be?  Some of them appreciate the...  I got my fans, and then I got my haters on this one.  The return of the psychopath Opie to the streets, and other people upset.  A little upset. 
[00:55:00]  Poor gentleman lost his cake.  Well, we got a couple really quick clips from yesterday's walkover.  Yeah.  It's worth playing here, because half our audience has not heard this yet.  Yeah.  You know, after we leave, we grab mics, and we broadcast our walk from here to the XM Studios.  It's not a block and a half down the road, so we figured, why not keep the show rolling?  So we put on...  Yeah, we have microphones, and some days we just walk over there.  Nothing happens.  Right.  Other days, things happen. 
[00:55:30]  Yeah.  It's just like, you know, it's unscripted.  It's just walking down the streets of New York City.  Some days, nothing.  Some days, you get what happened yesterday.  Yeah.  And then we continue on XM for a couple hours.  Yeah.  Every day we do this.  So yesterday was a great walkover, by the way.  Yeah.  There was a lot going on.  We had the Italian girl that we've...  Befriended.  Yes.  Befriended.  Yeah.  What a coincidence.  Yeah.  We just see her every day.  And well, you get to see the same people every day when you do this walk.  It's true.  Yeah.  I guess at the same time, the same people are in the same location. 
[00:56:00]  When you really start looking around, you realize you're seeing the same people every  day.  Same people.  But being a New Yorker, you know, most people don't even look around them at their surroundings.  So we came across Andrew, our homeless friend.  Yeah.  We've been talking to him for, I don't know, three or four months now, probably.  Yeah.  We had a homeless guy before him, but he disappeared.  I think he died.  It's not looking good.  His legs were rotting off.  And then we found Andrew, but Andrew was kind of displaced, and we hadn't seen him for 
[00:56:30]  about three weeks or so because some other guy took his spot.  Right.  Built up this big cardboard house.  Yeah.  Housing complex that he's living in.  Takes up the entire front of a store.  For some reason, that's completely legal.  That's fine.  In midtown.  No one cares.  No one bothers him.  No one cares.  He's got a cat.  I can understand if this is on the outskirts of town, but no, this guy decided, no, I'm  building my little abode right here.  Right here on 57th Street in front of a store.  Right.  And he kind of took over Andrew's spot, so Andrew had to move down the block a little 
[00:57:00]  bit.  Mm-hmm.  And he was sitting out there yesterday, so we decided to sit and talk with him.  The one thing we have noticed about Andrew, when we first met him, he was very lucid.  He was very with it.  Yeah.  It was almost like, why are you homeless?  Why are you homeless?  You seem like you could get yourself a job.  And now, four months later, it's...  It's starting to get to him.  He's going downhill fast.  He was drinking.  He was drunk yesterday.  Yeah.  I never drank, but yesterday he was a little drunk.  He was drinking.  He looked a little more unkempt than usual.  Yeah.  He usually gets some clothes from the church, and he's usually a little cleaner than he was 
[00:57:30]  yesterday.  He was a little greasy yesterday.  Yeah.  So we came upon Andrew yesterday, and well, this is what happened as it was captured on  XM Satellite Radio.  Is this Andrew?  Hey, Andrew.  Wow.  Where have you been?  Look at that.  How you doing, Andrew?  I love watching the decline of Andrew.  Andrew, where the f*** have you been?  Andrew, they're taking your spot over there.  The guy took your spot with a box and a cat.  And my spot is a large spot. 
[00:58:00]  Well, yeah.  They're taking...  He paid that man his money.  Are you cold?  Are you cold today?  I'm cold.  Of course I'm cold.  Are you a little drunk?  You look a little woozy today.  You look a little drunk.  No, I'm not drunk, but I had a couple of views.  A couple went about an hour ago.  Last night.  Oh, last night?  Yeah.  Partying with the guys?  What's in the box?  What's in the box?  What's in the box?  What's in the box?  What's in the box?  What's in the box?  What's in the box?  Guys, freak yourself. 
[00:58:30]  What is it?  Wow, that looks good, but I am not touching.  Oh, I didn't realize he said treat yourself.  Treat yourself.  Here's a guy that doesn't have anything.  He is a homeless gentleman.  Yeah.  There was a box sitting next to him, and what he did was he lifted the box up and opened  the box and displayed this cake.  It was a cake that you would see at any diner or restaurant in that glass case, and just made  for that, because it's all pre-sliced, and there's little pieces of wax paper between 
[00:59:00]  each slice, and it was like a cinnamon-topped crumb cake.  It looked delicious.  The plastic was still on it.  Yeah, the whole thing was still wrapped in plastic.  Like, these things must go out to restaurants and diners, and then if they expire at the  warehouse, I guess the church gets them.  I'm just speculating here, but this just kind of makes sense as to how he got possession  of it.  And then hands it out to the homeless.  No, because they wouldn't give him a whole cake.  He would have gotten a piece of the cake. 
[00:59:30]  You think?  He probably got that from somebody who bought it for him or gave it to him.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Do you think?  They don't give out whole cakes.  Here you go.  Here's a pristine, unwrapped cake.  Yeah.  Here's a slice.  Beat it, stupid.  Don't get stabbed.  Right.  I didn't even hear that he said that.  Treat yourself.  Treat yourself.  Treat yourself.  He hasn't seen an indoor toilet in three years, and he's trying to share his good fortune  with his radio friends.  The guy is going through the toughest times of his life, yet he is still willing to share 
[01:00:00]  with people that are so much more well-off than he is.  Treat yourself.  That guy's a saint on the street.  That could be Jesus, Opie.  Do you know that he could be Jesus, come back to test people?  All right.  We don't need to play the rest.  Oh, no.  We need to play the rest.  By the way, CokeLogic from Whackbag, I talk about the ghost I see every morning on my couch.  Yeah.  Opie, that ghost you see on your couch before you leave every morning is your soul being 
[01:00:30]  left home while you're at work.  Oh, boy.  Treat yourself.  All right.  Treat yourself.  Let me hear that part again.  Mickey Rourke in bar flight.  Yeah, my friends.  Cake for my friends.  To my friends.  What's in the box?  What's in the box?  What's in the box?  What's in the box?  What's in the box?  You guys, treat yourself.  Oh.  Oh.  Treat yourself.  And if his, like I said, if his disgusting fingers weren't wrapped around that cake, 
[01:01:00]  I might have taken a slice and it was all wrapped.  It was wrapped.  They hadn't touched it.  I didn't care.  It had been unopened.  That's a pristine cake.  Didn't matter to me.  It was a pristine cake.  It looked delicious.  It certainly did.  All that cinnamon, sugar, crisp on top.  For a homeless guy, do you understand?  That's the holy grail of cakes.  Yeah.  Untouched.  Easy to hold with your hands and eat.  That could have lasted him how long, you think? 
[01:01:30]  Four years.  What's in the box?  What's in the box?  You guys, treat yourself.  What is it?  Wow, that looks good, but I am not touching it.  You ate it, Andrew.  No.  Let me see.  Put it down for a second.  It's some kind of a cinnamon, um, cakey thing.  Oh.  Come on.  I had to walk away.  Oh, no.  I'm leaving.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no. 
[01:02:00]  I earned that.  Oh, he didn't do that.  Oh, he did not do that.  I earned that.  Oh, no.  I earned that.  I earned that.  He's saying, I earned that.  I earned that.  I earned that.  Oh, why?  No.  Oh, no.  Yeah, Opie said, let me see it.  Put it on the ground, and then you hear a pop.  The pop you're hearing is not a tire blowing out on perhaps a bus driving down 57th Street.  It is that pristine plastic wrapping around the cake blowing out.  Cake flying out of the side of it, because Opie decided it was a great time to jump, both 
[01:02:30]  feet, jump into this man's cake.  Opie treated himself to a trampoline ride.  He told us to treat ourselves.  It really was.  That's how I treat myself.  It was.  It was a 9.8 of a jump.  It was both feet landed directly in the middle of the pristine cake.  And it was such a jump that if you see the video, he slides forward like an inch or two 
[01:03:00]  inches, because it was just a perfect landing, you slid on the paper.  A gymnast on the parallel, the uneven bars, would dream of sticking a landing like you did  on that cake, Opie.  You should have just put your hands up and bowed to the crowd, because both feet came  down on the cake.  And you could just hear Andrew in the back, oh, I earned that cake.  You know what I love about the audio, now that I listen back to it, like both of you 
[01:03:30]  guys are absolutely horrified.  We walked completely down the block.  And Jimmy said I had to walk away, but then he got caught up in it and just starts laughing  like I've never heard him laugh before.  Well, you can hear when you say, put it down, I went, oh, no.  Oh, no, because you know it's coming, because over the years, Opie's been, it's a known thing.  If you get something.  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.  Nothing's known.  All right. 
[01:04:00]  I like the element of surprise.  All right, Mr. Surprise.  It's sort of known that if you have anything of value to you, anything that means.  No, because I want to start getting gifts again.  I like gifts.  All right, then.  Our pal Steve gave me the first season of Lost.  I didn't smash that.  Then don't trounce on a man's cake, and perhaps you wouldn't get that reputation.  And I get a nice bottle of wine every once in a while.  I don't smash everything.  I've never seen you smash everything.  All right.  And I'm not even talking about things that you get.  I'm not talking about your gifts.  I'm talking about any time anyone gets something that kind of means a little something to them, 
[01:04:30]  Opie will say, hey, can I see that?  And we all know never, ever to give it to Opie, because it will end up either garbage or in  need of severe repair.  You're going to ruin it.  I think it's been ruined.  It's been 10 years, for God's sake.  All right.  Listen again, listen again, listen again to Jimmy finally going, you know what?  I knew it was coming, and I walked.  I saw the jump, and I walked away.  It was just so horrifying.  Of course, it was funny. 
[01:05:00]  Oh.  Wow.  That looks good, but I am not touching it.  You eat it, Andrew.  Let me see.  Put it down.  It's some kind of a cinnamon.  There it is.  There it is.  Oh, oh, oh.  All right.  You're going to hear when Opie says, put it down.  Opie goes, yeah, put it down.  And Jimmy goes, no.  Jimmy, right then, you did.  You knew exactly what was coming.  Jimmy's, no.  No.  But he put it down, and then you hear the pop.  It was every time you watch the car turn down Elm with Kennedy in the back of it. 
[01:05:30]  No, you just know how it's going to end.  That pink mist.  An old flap head.  That's right.  An old brain picker-upper on the trunk.  Yeah, maybe this time he won't make the turn.  Yeah.  This photo op wrecker climbing on the car.  Maybe they'll keep the top up this time.  No, see, it's still down.  It's still down.  Maybe that's. 
[01:06:00]  Treat yourself.  All right.  The proclamation.  Guys.  The proclamation.  My friends.  Treat yourself.  The only guys.  After all, we're all human.  That's right.  We're all human.  You guys are doing very well for yourself.  I am at the lowest point in my life.  But I have found it in my heart to treat you with some of my cake.  Hello, millionaires.  I have nothing, but my cake is your cake.  Treat yourself.  All right.  Put it on the ground.  No.  I know. 
[01:06:30]  This is so much to him, but to you it was just a cinnamon welcome mat.  Yeah, me and Jimmy, I had to really jog down the block to get, we couldn't, we couldn't  distance ourselves from the situation quickly enough.  Let's go back to the Jimmy no and then the actual stomping.  No.  It's some kind of a cinnamon cakey thing.  Oh.  Come on.  I had to walk away.  Oh, no. 
[01:07:00]  I'm leaving.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, he didn't do that.  Oh, he did not do that.  I'm there.  Oh, no.  See, I love hearing Jimmy change.  I'm there.  Of course I'm going to laugh.  Yeah, it was so uncomfortable that, like, the only emotion that could come out was laughter.  You, you, you. 
[01:07:30]  It was such an uncomfortable moment.  And then we ended up laughing for 20 straight minutes after that.  Oh, no.  No, don't.  I earned that.  No, why?  I was at lunch.  I just could not stop laughing at lunch.  And it's hard to explain to a girl why jumping onto the cake of a suffering homeless person is comedic gold.  There is no reason that should be funny.  Ever.  Ever.  It should be something you do accidentally and go, my God, can I replace it? 
[01:08:00]  And you're horrified.  You'll all end up crying in the street is how that should end up.  But you look at the way he callously throws a little bill at him like Sonny after he broke the cameras.  What did you throw, a five at him?  There's 12 slices of $4 cake in there.  That's a $50 cake.  And he throws 25 markets we have plus XM.  He throws a 10 at him.  I emptied my wallet.  That's all I had.  Of course it is.  And the money went blowing right by him, by the way. 
[01:08:30]  He asked if he took Amex.  He didn't.  Hey, someone from their cell phone, this person says, I told the story three times and everyone thought I was a dick for laughing.  Yeah, you can't convey this story outside the Opie and Anthony community and have it end up comedy.  Right.  It just doesn't happen.  The equation doesn't figure to equal comedy at the end of it.  Within the Opie and Anthony community, you understand the players and all that, so you understand why that's funny.  But you try to explain it to the outside people, and they're like, what are you listening to? 
[01:09:00]  It's horribly sad.  All right, then you got Anthony and Jimmy reacting.  He did not just ****.  Oh, no.  You knew it was coming right when he goes, hey, let me see that.  It was a full cake.  It was a full cake.  He opened it up.  It was offering a slice.  Opie grabbed it, put it on the sidewalk, and jumped as high as he could and landed on top of the cake.  Oh, no.  Opie throws money at him, and as it's going towards him, the wind picks it and blows it down. 
[01:09:30]  Oh, no.  He's like, just go **** yourself.  Oh, was that awful?  Oh, I know.  As soon as you put it down, I actually walked away, and I saw you jump up, and I walked away.  I just heard that smashing of cake under his feet.  You are despicable.  Oh, what a piece of ****.  That was his whole meal for like a week with that cake.  He was happy to show everyone the cake. 
[01:10:00]  He goes, look.  Both feet.  Both feet landed right in that cake.  Oh, my God.  Oh, that was beautiful.  Oh, it was so cringe-inducing, yet fun to watch.  Oh, my God.  You are horrible.  Please get that video up on YouTube immediately.  Thank God it was on tape.  Oh, no.  Oh, that is going to be a great download, man.  Anyway, there you go.  Pat from Unaki is suggesting that on the walkover today, Andrew should apologize to Opie for getting cake on his new Timberlands. 
[01:10:30]  Oh, no, I earned that cake.  You can't even find the video on the search engine of YouTube, and it's already been viewed a couple thousand times.  I don't know how that's possible.  The video is going to be up there any hour now, right? 
[01:11:00]  What, does it take a while for the search engines to update?  Yeah, yeah, you throw videos up there, and then it takes about almost 24 hours to actually appear on the search engine.  Millions of videos are being added.  Yeah, it's a while.  But if you search OAVideos, which is the username, and then just click the username to get the profile, you can see it that way.  Ooh, sweeter than you.  You're smart.  Sam's a good idea.  Well, there you go.  The video is making the rounds.  Oh, no.  Oh, see?  Oh, no.  Oh, see?  Oh, no, Muggsy.  Oh, no. 
[01:11:30]  Oh, no.  Oh, copper.  Uh, jump on my cake.  It's curtains for you.  You see?  Flat feet.  Oh, no.  Hey, hey, uh, cake foot.  By the way, Bartlett is showing Imus how to wow on MSNBC right now.  Oh, my God.  Because Imus is wearing the wow shirt today.  So, uh, Bartlett's wowing?  This is horrific.  See, they compete against us.  Yeah.  On the radio.  But that doesn't stop Imus from promoting us with, uh, with the wearing of an Opie and  Anthony wow shirt every Wednesday. 
[01:12:00]  And now you got Rob Bartlett showing Imus how to wow.  He's lifting up his, uh, shirt and showing his, uh, boobies and his, uh, belly to Imus.  Imus has done a great job of promoting this program.  You gotta give it to him.  I, I talk to people that are way out of our demo, you know, older gentlemen, and they  absolutely know this show.  Uh, he goes, oh, no, I, I know the show because I don't listen, but, uh, I hear, uh, Imus talks  about it a lot.  I have so many older women coming up to me.  Ooh, two, yeah.  Going, you're the one that Imus talks about. 
[01:12:30]  Yeah.  Like, I got this, like, uh, like this fan base of older women.  Cougars.  That don't know the Opie and Anthony show, but know us because of what Imus, uh, you know,  says on his program.  Yeah.  Especially with the picture where he says that he banged my mom back in the, uh, the  early seventies.  Yeah.  That's Imus's quote.  And, uh, and my mom had Imus's love child and that would be me.  And Imus is your father.  Yeah.  Because that side-by-side picture that you took at the bookstore in Huntington.  Yeah.  Uh, you kind of look, it looks like he could be your dad. 
[01:13:00]  Yeah.  A little bit.  So, uh, thanks, uh, Imus for promoting the show today.  Max, Oklahoma City.  Hey, what's going on, boys?  Hey.  Opie, I would just like to thank you for treating us to a good belly laugh yesterday.  And if you believe in reincarnation, I think you're going to come back as a dung beetle,  dude.  Yeah.  Or a cake.  A homeless man's cake.  Why is it?  Why am I being stomped on?  Oh, no.  Rob in Connecticut.  What's up?  Oh, I earned that.  Morning, boys.  How are you today? 
[01:13:30]  Hey.  Uh, you realize this guy has had a full day to think about the only thing that he ever  had, and Opie took it away from Opie.  You're going to die today.  He's going to kill you.  There's no way, right?  No, he's a very forgiving, um, Christian gentleman.  He makes the cross out of pennies every morning.  It's on a little napkin.  Yeah.  Yes.  A little napkin.  All right, enough.  Enough about the cake.  Poor bastard.  The video's, uh, going to be up on YouTube very, very soon.  I'm going to give him some money today.  I gave him a little bit yesterday, but...  Actually, I'll give him more today if I see.  Will you? 
[01:14:00]  Yeah, that's all I had yesterday.  You could have at least handed him to him.  Two singles.  Jesus.  Cost it at him.  Destitute.  Oh, we had a broadcast.  Good job to do.  You should have just pulled up some cardboard and sat next to him, you bum.  Two bucks.  All right, uh, it's the ONA virus spreading across America.  Jim Norton will be appearing on The Late Show with David Letterman, Wednesday, November 1st.  Check local listings for Showtime.  It's the O.B. and Anthony Show.  Hey, what's going on?  It's Bob Kelly, or, as other people know me, Robert Kelly. 
[01:14:30]  Uh, I got a huge tourgasm tour coming up.  Me, Gary Gellman, and Jay Davis.  No Dane Cook, so don't get excited.  We're going to 35 cities across the country.  Just go to my MySpace, MySpace slash Robert Kelly Live.  All the dates are up there.  Or go to Ticketmaster and type in tourgasm, and all the tour dates will come up with the  prices to the tickets.  So make sure you check it out.  Any questions, email me at robertkellylive.com.  I don't know.  That's about it.  Should I do a better ending? 
[01:15:00]  Oh, no.  What?  Treat yourselves.  Treat yourselves.  All of you.  Oh, I earned that cake.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Some controversy behind the scenes. 
[01:15:30]  We're getting together some of the negative campaign ads.  Yes.  From around the country.  And one of the campaign ads has the N-word in it.  So the people here at CBS said we can't play it on the air.  But now they're saying we can play it on the air.  So a little controversy.  We're going back and forth with the brass.  I was stunned that it's an actual political ad.  Yeah. 
[01:16:00]  We'll get into that in a minute or two.  Treat yourself.  What?  Treat yourself.  Jimmy.  Treat yourself.  And it's in the background.  Treat yourself.  Everybody.  I'm the big man now.  Like he felt like the guy that could just buy the bar, you know.  Hey, round the drinks for everybody.  Finally has something to contribute.  He felt the Lord provided that for him.  The Lord gives and I'll share.  I should share.  I cannot eat this entire cake.  Jesus has given this cake up onto me to give to you. 
[01:16:30]  So enjoy everybody.  But why are you stepping on my cake?  Someone left a cake out in the rain.  And Opie jumped in it.  I don't think that I could take it.  Because it took so long to make it.  Never get those footprints out of it again.  Oh, no. 
[01:17:00]  All right.  All right.  We got him a stripper for his birthday.  A blonde-haired boy who will jump into his cake.  You're making me think too much.  Stop it.  Stop it.  I don't think.  Turn down.  The Lord giveth and Opie taketh away.  The Lord giveth.  Does he?  Yeah, right?  Giveth you what?  I've had a cake that I could live in.  Right.  Let's say hi to...  I've had a cake with shingles and a front door. 
[01:17:30]  How about a gingerbread house?  Is that too much to ask?  Really?  Jesus.  Amanda from Pittsburgh.  Hey, how you doing?  All right.  Hi, Amanda.  Hey, you know, I'm a little distraught here.  You know, I just really feel bad that you're being so racist against cakes.  Yeah, Opie.  There you go.  Opie's a cakeist.  Good call back, Amanda.  I'm part cake.  You're part cake.  You're part cake.  And you're offended. 
[01:18:00]  You know, Amanda, we can't worry about offending everyone.  That might be part cake.  Your husband's a cake lover.  All right, Amanda.  Very good.  All right.  Michael J. Fox.  A lot of controversy over him shaking on TV.  Well, he's doing, he's helping out a candidate, I guess, who's in favor of the stem cell research.  Right.  I like the stem cell research.  Why the hell can't we just stem cells for everybody?  Treat yourselves to stem cells.  Opie jumps on the little things.  The back of the little infants. 
[01:18:30]  Oh, no.  That could have cured Parkinson's.  Why?  Oh, no.  Oh, God gave me the stem cell.  Treat yourself.  I'll never get over that.  But, yeah, I like the stem cell thing.  And for some reason, the ridiculous right just has decided, no, it's no good.  What asses.  They've limited it.  And the right will tell you, oh, no, they allow it. 
[01:19:00]  They allow it.  Yeah, they've limited the amount of strings of these things that could be used.  I mean, everyone that has any knowledge on stem cell research should have access to stem cells.  It's just the way they've proven that this is, it's the future of defeating a lot of these diseases.  But it's being held back because of religious beliefs of politicians who are supposed to have this separation of church and state.  But for some reason, it's complete tying together of church and state. 
[01:19:30]  It's sickening.  It really, really is.  So Michael J. Fox did a political ad that is for this candidate that is for stem cell research because he wants it to help out people with Parkinson's.  Because he's got it real bad.  Yeah.  Real bad.  Shaking like crazy.  But apparently there's some controversy because he went off of his medication that controls it.  I've seen him on other shows.  He's moving around a lot.  It's like he's fidgeting in his seat.  Right.  When he's on the medication. 
[01:20:00]  But he went off the medication just to do this ad.  And now people are saying it's not as honest because he's off the medication and he's shaking like crazy.  But, you know, the normal Joe on the street might get his cake jumped on.  And also might not be able to afford the drugs that Michael J. Fox can take to control this.  Wouldn't it be nice to eradicate the disease?  That's totally honest.  Stem cell research.  Yeah.  So I think it's it's.  Yeah.  I see nothing wrong with it.  It's a little deceiving.  It's a little deceiving. 
[01:20:30]  But it shows someone with Parkinson's.  It's an honest assessment of somebody with Parkinson's without the medication.  Right.  Yeah.  So.  Plus, he said he drank a bunch of Red Bulls.  And this was filmed during the quake of 89.  Oh, was he dancing?  Did a few toots.  He should be on Dancing with the Stars.  Be funny if he was and they booed him the first week.  Yeah.  He is really going back and forth and just cannot stay still.  And of course, now on YouTube, they're taking that video and putting it to music like All 
[01:21:00]  Shook Up and other fine songs.  They put it to the Stevie Wonder, I just called to say I love you.  Yeah.  Because he's kind of his head's moving back and forth like Stevie's.  Here's the audio.  As you might know, I care deeply about stem cell research.  In Missouri, you can elect Claire McCaskill, who shares my hope for cures.  Unfortunately, Senator Jim Talent opposes expanding stem cell research.  Senator Talent even wanted to criminalize the science that gives us a chance for hope.  Wow.  They say all politics is local, but it's not always the case. 
[01:21:30]  What you do in Missouri matters to millions of Americans.  Sorry.  Americans like me.  You can hear them shuffling on that.  I'm part of Caskill, and I approve this message.  The Republicans really are just, especially the religious influence, is disgusting.  It's the religious influence on it that is really upsetting.  Just disgusting.  You know, and there's no other reason.  There's no other reason for it to not allow this, but religious belief. 
[01:22:00]  Right.  And that should be kept out of it.  Where's Danny?  We got these negative campaign ads from across the country, and they're getting ugly.  Ugly, ugly, ugly, ugly.  Yeah.  I need Danny right now.  We love him, though.  We love the mud slinging.  We'll do a quick filler.  It is Whip Him Out Wednesday.  Ladies, please flash our fine listeners.  If you see a WOW sticker or a WOW sign on the back of their car, that's what WOW stands for.  Whip Him Out Wednesdays.  And, of course, guys, don't harass the ladies. 
[01:22:30]  No, you just look, you observe, you enjoy, you move on.  Right.  If you're a fan of the show, you understand that.  Yeah.  They've been doing it for years.  And they've been very cool as far as that goes.  So, it is Whip Him Out Wednesday.  And Imus is wearing a Opie and Anthony WOW t-shirt today.  Want to get WOWed?  Well, he had Brian Wilson, the Brian Wilson character played by Rob Bartlett, WOWing Imus this morning on their show.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  The disc, um, Iraq, you jerk, stupid. 
[01:23:00]  Mm-hmm.  Hold on.  All right.  I'm Brian Wilson.  How are you?  I'm fine.  Whip Him Out Wednesdays.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Opie?  Maybe, uh.  Back to you.  Maybe Foxworthy will be funny.  Oh.  I'm on my way, Howard.  Howard.  There's not a, there are more people in this room listening to me than are listening to Howard Stern.  It's 29 if they are. 
[01:23:30]  Oh.  Yeah, I guess Howard shows for free for the next couple days on the internet and they enjoy.  Not much of a buzz whatsoever as far as that goes.  Really no, uh, no excitement going on over there.  Wow.  He went for the paycheck.  God bless him.  God bless him.  Hey, you're set for the rest of 20 lives.  All right.  Enjoy.  Negative political ads.  Half a billion bucks will take care of you.  Certainly will.  Danny has gotten a lot of negative political ads from across America and some of these are really, really ugly. 
[01:24:00]  Let's listen to the first one here.  Hi, sexy.  You've reached the live one-on-one fantasy line.  A phone number to an adult fantasy hotline appeared on Michael Arcuri's New York City hotel room bill while he was there on official business.  And the call was charged to Oneida County taxpayers.  Arcuri has denied it.  But the facts are there.  Who calls a fantasy hotline and then bills taxpayers?  Michael Arcuri.  Bad call.  The National Republican Congressional Committee paid for and is responsible for the content of this night. 
[01:24:30]  Oh, Jesus.  Wow, that's a good one.  What a dope this guy is.  Yep.  They're all dopes.  What a dope.  I don't want to vote for him, though.  I respect that.  I know you do.  How could you not?  Yeah, you can relate to a guy like that, right?  The guy's just alone in his hotel room.  Wants a little time to himself.  Imagine it backfires and he wins by a landslide.  Of course.  I don't.  I thought people would be against this.  No.  They love it.  How great is that, though?  Oh, the guy's just ruining that hotel bed. 
[01:25:00]  Right.  Bill to the taxpayers.  Anything they could dig up now, because like we were saying yesterday, it's too dangerous for a candidate to actually say what they stand for.  Right.  Because people might disagree with it.  So instead, they just bash the other guy.  And that's all it's turned into.  That's a good one.  Here's the next one.  I'm John Racey, and I approve this message.  In a disgusting display of arrogance, Senator Byrd recently said that if my father were still alive, 
[01:25:30]  he would support Senator Byrd and be ashamed of me.  My father, Dyke Racey, would be here by my side today, as he was throughout my life.  When talking about his own upbringing on Fox News five years ago, Senator Byrd was asked about his mother.  You were talking about your mother and what she had taught you.  There are white niggers.  I've seen a lot of white niggers in my time when I used that word.  I know you were trying to make a point where that word means ignorance.  Is there a misunderstanding for what that word really means?  Well, I've heard many people use it. 
[01:26:00]  I've heard black leaders use it.  I've heard white leaders use it.  I meant nothing by that, except as you were saying.  That's another one of those things that come and go.  I don't dwell on them.  I try not to live too much in the past.  I knew Dyke Racey better than anyone, Senator Byrd.  And believe me, you're no Dyke Racey.  Paid for by Racey for Senate Committee.  That's all he can say after that?  And he's trying to reach back to that great moment with the debate with Dan Quayle.  Right. 
[01:26:30]  Oh, God, stop.  Wow.  Dyke Racey.  Dyke Racey.  Jesus.  That's a candidate you need to vote for.  How do you pull the handle for Dyke Racey?  Paid for by fast lesbians.  What a great name, man.  That's a porn name.  Never would have thought they'd have gotten into NASCAR.  That's great.  Yeah, that's pretty interesting. 
[01:27:00]  Sponsored by a clam company.  And you can tell which car it is because it has fur on the outside on the roof.  Oh, this is good.  Listen to this next negative political ad.  A young Florida state trooper heading home stops to help a stranded motorist.  The driver, an escaped convict, kills the trooper with five shots.  The killer is tried and convicted.  Liberal Democratic Governor Bob Graham signs death sentence. 
[01:27:30]  Attorney Deval Patrick is hired by convicted killer.  Gets sentence reduced.  Now killer is eligible for parole.  While lawyers have a right to defend admitted cop killers, do we really want one as our governor?  Wow.  All right, you can't vote for that guy.  Wow.  But I bet he's got an ad that makes the other guy look even worse.  I might have had the sentence reduced, but who do you think shot the cop?  My opponent.  Whoa.  They left that detail out.  Wow, are they just using every little bit of ammo they can to just – 
[01:28:00]  Where does this end, by the way?  They have teams of people researching their opponents for bad things.  Where does this end?  It's getting uglier and uglier every year.  Every year it gets worse and worse.  And I really think the New Jersey election last year –  With the ex-wives involved?  Yeah, that made – that set a precedent like anything goes. 
[01:28:30]  And it worked.  It worked.  So the rest of the country now is picking up that ball and just running with it.  Wow.  I love them.  I love it because they're all just scumbags, and it's showing them for what they really are.  And other people's also – it shows the American people kind of what the voting public is about too  because some guys try to take the high road and don't do the negative campaigning, and they lose.  They lose. 
[01:29:00]  People are buying this crap.  You guys said eligible for parole in that last spot we heard.  Did they say when?  Notice he conveniently left out eligible for parole when.  Now, I agree.  The guy, if he killed a cop like that, should be put to death, you know, without – not in 20 years.  Quickly.  Believe me.  Outback.  I'm all for it.  But the guy left out how – you know, when he's eligible.  Is it 2000 – you know –  89? 
[01:29:30]  89 when the guy's going to be dead anyway?  I don't know.  It's just odd.  They leave things out.  They twist things around.  Well, the next one is for Ron Kind.  His name's Kind.  And they say he's the –  Oh, this must be a pleasant ad.  And they say he's the wrong kind.  Ah.  What's this one about, Danny?  Well, this is good.  And in the ad, what they do is they have a little W and a big R-O-N and then a little G so you can see Ron.  In the middle of Ron?  And wrong. 
[01:30:00]  Ew.  Oh, because you can't spell wrong without old Ron.  There you go.  I got you.  Good thing his name is not Skunst.  Let's go to Dan in Philly.  Dan?  Hey, good morning, boys.  How you doing?  Pretty good, Dan.  On the first ad you played of the sex line call, I read in the papers what had happened was it was one of his staffers that did it.  And the call lasted less than one minute.  And it was followed the next minute by a call that had the same exact numbers except for the last two, which was a congressional staffing office. 
[01:30:30]  Yeah, they leave that out.  Oh, okay.  See, they left that out.  Even the guy's opponent called and said it was a disgraceful ad.  It's completely untrue.  It was the Republican National Committee that ran the ad, not the candidate.  Yeah, that's another thing.  Sometimes the candidates aren't even responsible for these.  That's why they say, and I approve this ad at the end to show that, you know, this is one of my ads.  Sometimes it's just a group, an interest group that, you know, is for the Republicans or the Democrats, and they'll really get brutal. 
[01:31:00]  Maybe they asked him to go after this, and he goes, no, I understand why this happened.  Yeah.  It really did dial something wrong, and then he realized it was a sex call, so he just wrapped it up in four hours.  But did he have it taken off?  Probably not.  Yeah, he don't go down.  Mike from Boston.  Okay.  That's an ad for a masked governor.  His opponent, Kerry Healy, has people in jumpsuits with signs that say, inmates for Devil Patrick or Deval Patrick or whatever. 
[01:31:30]  Devil, if your name's Devil.  Yeah, yeah, well.  I think you're winning.  She's also the one that has the ad.  You might have seen it.  It's like an animated ad, and it's about the Big Dig, and these little cartoons, actually, they're asked the question, like, what happened with the Big Dig?  And the animation shows them, like, shoving their heads in appropriate places.  Really?  Yeah.  And, like, that's the whole basis of it.  Like turning and...  Yeah, like physically...  Like making a loop out of yourself and sticking your head somewhere dark.  Really?  Exactly.  And dingy and smelly. 
[01:32:00]  There you go.  All right, the next one, yeah, this is the Ron Kind one we were just talking about.  Ten years ago, liberal lawyer Ron Kind was elected to Congress, and he's done almost nothing in the Congress since.  And that's a good thing, because just about everything he's tried to do has been wrong.  Ron Kind voted to take the words under God out of the Pledge of Allegiance.  He voted to strip the Ten Commandments from our public buildings.  Ron Kind repeatedly voted for gay marriage and to force the Boy Scouts to accept homosexual leaders. 
[01:32:30]  Wow.  This guy's despicable.  I like Ron Kind.  Ron Kind.  He's shaking things up.  And they were basically saying he's obsessed with the gays, because he's, like, repeatedly voted.  Repeatedly.  Like, one vote wasn't a good one.  Where's the next vote for this?  Where's the next?  I'm voting now.  I'm just going to pass a hat around.  But the vote's over with, sir.  Don't care.  I want to vote again.  They're voting on the victims' funds for 9-11.  I don't go as long as the gays are in the Boy Scouts. 
[01:33:00]  I'll vote for it.  Please.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Sorry about that.  Sorry.  Not only is the audio good, but the visuals that go along with some of this audio is great,  because when they're talking about the gay marriage and stuff, they'll have, like,  a rainbow disco ball hanging with a wedding cake with two grooms on it.  Oh, they are the worst.  They're just a bunch of gopes.  That's very funny.  That is really funny.  At this point, why should we even vote?  Why vote for any of these idiots?  They're all just despicable human beings. 
[01:33:30]  Ron Tyne repeatedly voted for gay marriage and to force the Boy Scouts to accept homosexual  leaders.  Of course.  He even voted to let illegal aliens burn the American flag for Congress.  You can vote for that?  Wow.  Is there a vote for that?  I want to...  Where is the thing where I pull the lever for letting illegal aliens burn the American flag?  This is...  Oh, God.  Makes my cake stomping look not that bad, right?  You know what? 
[01:34:00]  The bill was probably the standard bill whether you should be allowed to burn the American  flag in protest.  Right.  And it doesn't sound as good, so you just pick a group and go, you know, it could have  been anybody, but allow illegal aliens to burn the flag.  Now, that sounds bad, but it could have been just anybody, you know, soldiers' family.  You know, it doesn't sound as bad as illegal aliens.  Burn the American flag.  For Congress, Ron-kind is the wrong kind. 
[01:34:30]  Oh, man.  The right kind of Congressman is Paul R. Nelson.  This former Marine is a father of four who supports Wisconsin values.  Paul R. Nelson will work to stop illegal immigration, to end our dependence on foreign oil, to win  the war on terror.  How?  And to defend traditional marriage.  I'm Paul R. Nelson, and I approve of this message.  That's a fake voice, right?  It's a word by Paul R. Nelson for Congress.  I'm Paul.  I'm Paul.  Treat yourselves. 
[01:35:00]  I'm Paul Nelson.  And I like sex the normal way.  Why are you stepping on the voting booth when people trying to vote for me?  Look, my Bible.  Help yourself.  Help yourself.  All right.  Yeah, he sounds like a Bible thumper.  That Paul Nelson is a stick in the mud.  Yeah.  The other guy wants Sodom and Gomorrah.  Bunch of men without pants running in circles.  Running the Boy Scouts.  Forget those little uniforms.  Put skirts on those lads. 
[01:35:30]  Forcing the Boy Scouts to have gay leaders.  That's right.  Smacking soldiers.  Burning the flag.  I like Ron-kind.  Look at this, see?  There's two men kissing New Jersey to rule on legalizing gay marriage.  Oh, wow.  Because that's one of the big stories out there.  And they're sensationalizing it all day on Fox News by just showing men and I think more  men or lesbians.  I don't know what that was.  Yeah, it was something with genitals and a mullet.  Yeah, they had the opportunity to show lesbians kissing on TV and they find the butchiest, the 
[01:36:00]  ugliest lesbians possible.  I guess to keep the story safe.  Yeah.  Find hot chicks.  Find hot chicks.  Why don't they just let gay people get married?  Leave them alone.  Let them suffer like the rest of us, right guys?  That's the gag.  Shut up.  Why don't they just...  Hate that joke.  Just leave gay people alone.  Every single time.  Fatty Pig Fatty brought to you by H57 Hootie.  Lose weight for free at H57.com.  Current leader in the Fatty Pig Fatty contest is Honey from Binghamton, New York. 
[01:36:30]  505 pounds.  Yeah.  That's right.  That means $5,050 for her if no one beats her and $1,000 to the guy that brought her  because there's a finder's fee.  Tough one to beat.  To the person that brings in the fatty winner.  And on Monday or Tuesday, is that Tuesday is the last one?  Tuesday morning, we will crown a winner.  Yeah.  So if there's any fat girls out there, you're running out of time.  505 pounds is pretty impressive.  That is, but there's got to be someone bigger out there.  What Opie did to that cake, Honey once did to somebody's Buick when they showed it to her.  By the way, we're looking for negative campaign ads that have something to do with the Opie 
[01:37:00]  and Anthony show.  Yeah.  Pretty much vote for your favorite member of the Opie and Anthony show by smashing someone  else on the show and send in your negative campaign ads, okay?  Ron kind rules.  He voted to let illegal immigrants burn the flag.  Repeatedly voted for gay marriage.  That's all he thinks about.  And to force the Boy Scouts to take homosexuals.  And that other boar. 
[01:37:30]  Ah, I have traditional values.  Ah, hi.  And all of a sudden, the music got nice.  Went from that ominous Boy Scouts being abused music to just bling-de-ding, the nice piano  music.  I'm a former Marine, father of four, and I like sex the normal way.  I don't know about that former Marine thing.  Hoorah.  Semper fi.  We got three more to get to after the break.  We also have Danny Bonaducey stopping by in a few minutes here. 
[01:38:00]  Yeah.  All right, so why don't we step aside for a bit here.  Yes, Danny.  Can I tease one?  Ooh.  One we haven't played yet?  Yes.  Ooh, Dan.  There's another one that's against Ron Kind.  Oh.  Really?  And it's probably the worst one I've ever played.  Oh, my God.  We haven't played the worst one yet?  Oh, no.  Oh, I can't wait.  I love Ron Kind.  Vote for Ron Kind.  He rules.  He's a mess.  Write him in, even if he's not in your state.  Ron Kind for anything. 
[01:38:30]  Hey, someone's being very hurtful on the instant feedback from their cell phone.  Opie should run for Senate.  He's just as despicable.  That's not nice.  It's the O&A virus spreading across America.  So I was in the grocery store, and there was this stock boy stacking melons.  So I figured, hey, I'll show him some real melons.  Well, when I flashed him, he lost his balance, and the entire stack of melons came crashing  down on him.  He was suffocated under two tons of melons.

[01:39:30]  We'll talk to him in a few minutes.  We've got to get back to the negative campaign ads.  We're loving them.  How could you not?  It is awful and despicable that they go in this direction, but I've got to say it is entertaining.  Wouldn't sway my vote.  I don't even think it's awful.  It is awful as a country.  Oh, yeah.  It's too bad they can't just go on TV and say, this is what I stand for, and people will 
[01:40:00]  actually listen and then make an educated decision.  It's come down to this.  Just bash the hell out of your opponent.  And it's gotten so partisan that it doesn't matter who wins because nothing can get accomplished  because they cannot agree on anything, so nothing gets done anymore.  And it's just more polarized every year.  Every year.  So this is what we get.  Now they're just personally attacking each other.  And according to Danny, on the way, the worst one he's heard so far. 
[01:40:30]  And then after these ads are over and the election's over and everything, they go, and I'll call  him and concede.  Hello, don't support him.  He'll do a great job for our state.  We need to get behind our new governor or whatever he's going to be.  But you were the one that made us hate him.  You pretty much called him a kid toucher.  Right.  And now you want us to like him?  Yeah.  All right. 
[01:41:00]  Here's the next negative political ad.  Hi, sexy.  You've reached the live world.  You like that one, do you?  How could you not?  I hope he's just playing that one again for himself.  Sorry.  Next summer, I'm going on a camping trip with my friends.  Uh-oh.  On my way home, I'll be in a car accident and I'll be paralyzed for the rest of my life.  Don't go, idiot.  In 20 years, I'll have Alzheimer's.  I won't recognize my husband or my kids.  Well, start taking notes now, then. 
[01:41:30]  Looking to the future?  Jeez.  Get some loose leaf and some pens.  You're going to need it.  Next summer, I'm going on a camping trip with my friends.  On my way home, I'll be in a car accident and I'll be paralyzed for the rest of my life.  In 20 years, I'll have Alzheimer's.  I won't recognize my husband or my kids.  Next week, my mommy and dad are going to find out that I have diabetes.  This is my congressman.  Congressman Chris Chikola.  He voted against federal funding for stem cell research. 
[01:42:00]  Is he a doctor?  Kid involved?  Is he a scientist?  Why did Congressman Chikola bet my life that he knows best?  Help me.  Help me.  Who knows?  Maybe I'm your mother.  Maybe I'm your grandson.  Maybe I'm your little girl.  How do you know I'm not you?  Stem cell research could save lives.  Maybe yours or your family's.  Someone you love.  Only Congressman Chikola said no. 
[01:42:30]  How come he thinks he gets to decide who lives and who dies?  Who is he?  Majority action is responsible for the content of this advertising.  Wake up, little boy.  And I'll tell you who he is, bad little boy.  He's the congressman.  So take your bad blood and beat it.  Shut your no-sugar-tolerating body up.  I thought that was an ad for male nurses.  A male nurse in a pillow can cure a lot of ills.  Wow.  Wow. 
[01:43:00]  All right.  You're sick, aren't you?  I'm going to be paralyzed in a car accident.  It's an ad against Asian drivers.  Oh, well.  Poor Frisco didn't hear that one.  I was just about to say that.  We're going to protest.  Don't do that quickly.  Here's the next negative political ad.  One away from the worst one Danny has heard so far.  Here's a question.  If a teacher at your kid's school, or a friend, or a co-worker, 
[01:43:30]  if anyone you knew actually praised a convicted rapist,  what would you think?  Deval Patrick did.  Here's what he said about brutal rapist Ben Laguerre.  He is eloquent, and he is thoughtful.  There's no doubt about that.  Here's another question.  Have you ever heard a woman compliment a rapist?  Deval Patrick, he should be ashamed, not governor.  What did he compliment?  I don't know.  What did he compliment?  Did she say what he complimented? 
[01:44:00]  He had good rope-tying technique.  That was nice.  That was quite an eagle nut.  Oh, I'm sorry, Danny.  That's not right.  I just don't think you're that important, so I keep your mic off.  I'm sorry.  All right, now you can figure it out.  All right, well, now I need you.  I'm sorry, you got me back.  All right, go ahead.  They basically just took, it could have been from anything.  They just took him saying something about somebody completely out of context,  and it's just Deval Patrick.  Yeah.  He's very eloquent and this and that and the other thing,  and just equated it to, you know, this rapist. 
[01:44:30]  Like, unless you're going to actually go and do the research and find.  Could you please, yeah, like,  like, I really want to know what this compliment to a rapist is?  Because what politician in his right mind would do that?  You know, I'm about to ruin my political career.  Oh, are you?  I'm Jim Norton, and I think rape is terrific.  You will never, ever hold public office.  Never.  Never.  Don't use that, I bet.  All right.  Here we go. 
[01:45:00]  Against you.  This is the worst one you've seen so far this season?  Absolutely.  If you didn't know any better, you would think that this was just a joke.  And this is an anti-Ron Kind?  Ron Kind.  Ron Kind.  Where is this battle taking place?  Because I want more of these.  Wisconsin.  This is the Wisconsin battle for what?  Uh, cheeseheads.  I'll find out.  Is it governor or Congress or?  Dog catcher.  I don't know.  Dog catcher.  He probably is some real crappy position.  What the hell is a dog catcher? 
[01:45:30]  I want to be your selectman.  Selectman.  Do ya?  Well, let's take a listen.  Here it is.  60 seconds of goodness.  Unkind.  With our servicemen and women facing death every day, what kind of congressman would try to gut military spending?  The wrong kind.  Ron Kind.  That's right.  Congressman Ron Kind is repeatedly voted to deprive our troops of the funding they need to fight for us.  But Ron Kind has no trouble spending your money.  He would just rather spend it on sex.  That's right.  Instead of spending money on cancer research, Ron Kind voted to spend your money to study the sex lives of Vietnamese prostitutes. 
[01:46:00]  Instead of spending money to study heart disease, Ron Kind spent your money to study the masturbation habits of old men.  Ron Kind spent...  Wow.  Are you kidding me?  That's a skit.  This is like SNL, right?  That cannot be a real ad.  You're tricking us.  I swear this is absolutely real.  I gotta go backwards. 
[01:46:30]  How do you dig this up?  They actually have this on the campaign website.  Oh my God.  He voted to study the masturbation habits of old men.  How do you not love that?  How do you not love Ron Kind?  Ron Kind gets my vote.  I want to move to Wisconsin just so I can vote.  How do I make that happen?  This Ron Kind is a go-getter.  We need money for cancer.  Forget it.  I want to know what he's thinking while he does that.  I know it's hack radio, but too bad we're not being heard in Wisconsin. 
[01:47:00]  We would get this guy voted in.  Oh, we would get all our listeners a vote for this guy.  Ron Kind.  We love Ron Kind.  Who's the stick in the mud?  Ron Kind voted to spend your money to study the sex lives of Vietnamese prostitutes.  Instead of spending money to study heart disease,  Ron Kind spent your money to study the masturbation habits of old men.  Ron Kind spent your tax dollars to study something called the bisexual,  transgendered, and two-spirited Aleutian Eskimos, whoever they are. 
[01:47:30]  Ron Kind even spent your tax dollars to pay teenage girls to watch pornographic movies  with probes connected to their genitalia.  Ron Kind.  All right.  Come on now.  Come on.  Come on.  There's no way.  You're kidding me.  What?  This so would make me want to vote for Ron Kind.  Oh, my God.  I want him for president.  This is going to make everyone remember his name. 
[01:48:00]  Yeah.  And what he does.  He's Dr. Frankenstein.  Can you make a promo out of this?  This needs to be a promo.  How did he get away with the electronically hooking up teenage girls?  I'll bet you they were 18.  Yeah, of course they were over age.  They had to sign consent form so they're older.  But they don't say that because it sounds a lot worse if it's that.  And what kind of.  Please don't explain. 
[01:48:30]  I want people to think that he's actually this sick.  You know what I would bet you that it's one bill that was signed to do some kind of like a grant that went to a college that they perhaps then used the money to study sexuality on the whole.  You know, like like not individual things like he's running around going, get me to Vietnam.  Get me some teenage girls.  I got electrodes.  Give me some old men.  I want to know what the hell they're doing in the bathroom.  You know, it probably is separated by him voting to allocate money to a grant to study sex. 
[01:49:00]  And they're picking it apart.  Who else wants to read the report?  Oh, please get it to me immediately.  I want the report on the old men.  The old men.  Absolutely.  You don't want the teen electrodes.  I want to know where she was swelling up at.  What parts of the movies did she swell?  That is awful.  She got nice and swollen. 
[01:49:30]  Let's go to Bob.  Hey, Bob.  Hey there, Bob.  What's up?  How you doing?  Good.  There's a woman in Alabama that's using her boobs in her campaign ad.  She has a t-shirt of a picture of her cleavage.  And her it says, vote for these boobs.  And then a picture of her opponents that says, not these boobs.  Treat yourself.  Treat yourself to these boobs.  Not these boobs.  Take care.  All right.  Yeah.  Someone is suggesting that the One Pest support Ron Kind. 
[01:50:00]  Absolutely.  I don't know how we get that done, but Ron Kind for president.  Wow.  Screw Obama.  Ron Kind is going to work his way up the political ladder doing what he's doing.  He sure is.  I backed it up again.  It's just too good.  Of course they are.  Ron Kind even spent your tax dollars to pay teenage girls to watch pornographic movies  with probes connected to their genitalia.  Ron Kind pays for sex, but not for soldiers.  If Ron Kind had better priorities, you wouldn't be having to hear this. 
[01:50:30]  Ron Kind is out of touch, and soon he'll be out of Congress.  I'm Paul R. Nelson, and I approve of this message.  And then we get Paul R. Nelson.  I'm Paul R. Nelson, and I would never do anything like that.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  I don't find teenage girls hot.  No probes.  No probes.  Ron Kind is running against Larry S. Flint.  I'm Ron Kind.  Off we get away from my cake. 
[01:51:00]  Oh, my God.  I'm getting really good news out of Chicago.  Jack, what's up?  Hey, good morning, Ron.  Good morning.  I want to let you guys know that the WCKG gets a signal almost all the way up to Milwaukee,  Wisconsin.  So depending on what county this guy is in, you can potentially influence that race.  Oh, people.  Please tell me we're talking to potential voters.  Please tell me this.  Because we're just about done with Jerry.  I think Jerry's going to finally be voted off, unfortunately, but we'll see. 
[01:51:30]  Are we taking up the Ron Kind card?  Oh, are we?  Are we officially throwing our endorsement behind Ron Kind?  Yes, we are.  Oh, please tell me.  You know, if the other guy, Paul, what's his name?  Paul R. Nelson.  Paul R. Nelson.  If he wants equal time to come on and debate, he can come on and speak his piece.  Oh, absolutely.  Can we get Ron Kind on the phone?  Please.  I want to talk to Ron Kind.  I want to talk to the guy that wants to study the habits of old men. 
[01:52:00]  The old men's.  That's right.  And he even provided crackers.  Oh, to an old copy of AARP.  He pays for sex but doesn't support the troops.  What?  What?  Oh, look at the cost of Florida real estate.  Someone stole the Glen Gary leads.  Oh, my God.  This has to backfire on Paul R. Nelson. 
[01:52:30]  I hate him.  Paul R. Nelson.  Pray yourself.  I'm a former Marine.  I worked in the motor pool.  I just hope that's not a speech impediment because it's something he did for this country.  I pray.  I pray.  Oh, Jesus.  Maybe we ought to have done our research.  Oh, I hope he didn't take anything like an RPG.  That's where I draw the line.  That's right.  That's right.  That's where I draw the line.  Someone do some research on Paul R. Nelson.  Even if he did get hurt, he still wouldn't make his voice go, 
[01:53:00]  Ma, see?  Ma.  Ma.  You don't want to vote for Ron Kind, see?  No, Mugsy.  Come and get me, copper.  Get me more anti-Ron Kind commercials.  There's got to be more.  That's it.  You know, there's a standout every election.  Last year's was Jersey's race with Corzine and Forrester.  I don't even remember the other anti-negative ads we played today.  I don't even remember any of them.  This year, it's Ron Kind and Paul R. Nelson.  Paul R. Nelson.  This is the race to watch. 
[01:53:30]  That's right.  You cheeseheads got some entertainment.  That's right.  What are Ron Kind's ads like?  I'd love to see what that's like.  Yeah, I want to see a Ron Kind ad against.  Paul R. Nelson.  Yeah, yeah.  Hi, I'm Ron Kind.  At least I don't talk, like.  That's all he should say.  Do you want this guy representing you?  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  Hey.  That's not nice.  Yeah, a lot of people checking out the video of the cake stomping.  It's going to be on YouTube shortly. 
[01:54:00]  Oh, no.  Shortly.  All right.  Why don't we get Danny Bonaduce in here?  We'll take a quick break.  I'm in.  That's impossible.  And I paid for this cake.  And we'll get Danny Bonaduce in here.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  Hey, what's up?  It's Louis, Twitchell's, Santani.  Shut up!  Tourette's Day is coming to the Opie and Anthony show, which is to say that we've discovered  a new excuse to point and laugh at people who are different.  To help us understand a little bit more about Tourette's, we've enlisted the help of hearing-impaired 
[01:54:30]  Chicago reporter Karen Meyer.  Tourette's is wrong.  It's a new radical disorder that's cute twice by involuntarily tick and repeated vocalizations.  Exactly.  So if you have Tourette's or if you know somebody with Tourette's, muster up some courage and  an ounce of self-control and get in touch with the Opie and Anthony show.  Contact Steve at foundrymusic.com.  That's Steve at foundrymusic.com.  And remember, be yourself one tick at a time. 
[01:55:00]  Tourette's Day.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Jim Norton from the Opie and Anthony show.  Hi, Angel.  Hi.  New York City, I'm coming back, November the 10th, Hammerstein Ballroom.  Tickets are on sale now at Ticketmaster here in New York, November 10th, Hammerstein Ballroom.  I'll be performing with our own Nathaniel and another guest who I have to figure out yet.  For more information, check out Jim's website at itobullet.com. 
[01:55:30]  Yeah, let's get right back into the show.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  And we got to say hi to Danny Bonaduce.  Hey.  Danny.  We met you many, many years ago in L.A.  I remember.  When you were like just pushing your kid around in a stroller outside the comedy store.  That may not have been my kid.  That might have been all my belongings at that point in my life.  And then I once saw you when you were doing radio in New York going to one of these burger joints.  Yeah, I'm a big burger here.  It was a crap hole.  Actually, you walked in and walked out. 
[01:56:00]  No, I didn't, dude.  I walked in, threw down a shot when I thought no one was looking.  I walked out.  Oh, that's what you were doing?  Yeah, I used to.  I don't know anymore of it.  Yeah, hell yeah.  Used to?  Dude, when I used to go to the gym, my whole Gatorade bottle was vodka.  And I knew my work.  At the gym?  Yeah.  What does that do?  Can I tell you something?  Physically to work out and drink alcohol.  I work for, I got a job.  I can't believe I'm plugging this because I want to sell tickets to comics tonight.  That's where I'm performing.  That's who's paying me.  Yeah.  Because the million bucks for a breaking body, gee, I don't know what the hell happened to it. 
[01:56:30]  It's gone.  I spend it.  It's gone.  You know, comics is paying me real money.  I want to plug those guys.  So go to comics tonight and tomorrow night.  It's C-O-M-I-X-N-Y.com.  Okay?  So go.  So what Vodka does...  Did you get a speech right before you came in?  Look, make sure you mention the website.  No, no, no.  Nobody ever plugs the website.  No, because I mean, really, they're my employer and you owe them something.  But the fact of the matter is, I'll tell you, when I took this job, there's a company called  Pod Fitness, and I took a job with them, and they said, what do you know that other trainers 
[01:57:00]  don't know?  And I said, well, every trainer knows that you burn off 600 calories an hour running.  I know you burn 1,200 if you're running from the cops.  And I said, oh, you're our guy.  So then I said, like, if you're drinking a six-pack of beer a day, that's 1,800 calories.  Yeah.  I got to keep you on a treadmill for three hours.  You take that to six shots of vodka, throw them down all at once.  Now you're wasted?  It's still only 480 calories.  I'll take it off you in 45 minutes.  Plus, if you're on the Atkins diet, you don't have to do anything because there's no carbs. 
[01:57:30]  That's the trainer for you.  There's a logical reason for doing shots of vodka at the gym.  It's brilliant.  Yeah.  Oh, absolutely there is.  If you're only eating steak and mayonnaise, man, you can drink all the straight spirits you  want.  Dude, you are an in-shape individual.  And I read it that you trained under Chuck Norris.  How long did you train under Chuck Norris for?  Under Chuck, personally, about a year.  But I stayed with the Chuck Norris system for the next 20.  Wow.  You're still doing the roids?  No, not anymore.  I had to give them up because, you know, here's what I did.  I forgot to mention it.  Here's what I did.  You just go to the bookstore and buy books on roids. 
[01:58:00]  They're legal books, First Amendment.  And I bought a book called The Encyclopedia of Steroids.  Because, do you know how I started taking steroids?  I said, this will give you a real indication into my character or lack thereof.  I'm in the gym getting ready for Breaking Bonaduce two and a half years ago or whatever.  And I'm living in there.  I'm pumping and I'm pumping.  And finally, this huge Mr. American Muscle Man comes up to me and goes, what are you trying  to do?  And I said, I want to be all chiseled for the show.  And he said, well, you can't do it.  I said, what do you mean, man?  He goes, you're too old and I can look at you, don't have the genetics. 
[01:58:30]  And I'm thinking, most muscle men are slow and usually sore.  I could probably knock this guy out for talking to me like this.  And he goes, you want some help?  And I thought, oh, well, yeah, I do.  And I thought he went training me and he opened a medical kit.  And I said, I'm in.  Just right then to a total stranger in the gym.  I go into a stinky, oh, it gets worse.  I go into a stinky, smelly bathroom at the gym.  Now, the only thing I was cognizant of, I watched him unwrap a brand new needle. 
[01:59:00]  Then he sticks it in the vial, pulls out a cc and a half, which I didn't know then,  just a certain amount.  Steroids are oil-based.  So to get them out, you need a 20-gauge needle, which is approximately the size of an  ice pick.  So you bleed all over the place when you're done.  So he rams this thing into my ass.  I don't even know this guy.  You have to drop your pants and all that?  Yeah.  Because it's such a big, it'll stay a huge bulge you won't miss all day on your shoulder  or anything.  Yeah.  On your body, because it stays there.  So as he rams the needle into my butt cheek and he's pushing, I went, you know, I don't 
[01:59:30]  know, what am I taking?  And I looked and I pick up the bottle and there's a picture of a bull on the top of the bottle.  And then it says, veterinario.  And I realized, I'm not only taking steroids meant for show bulls, but show bulls that don't  even speak English.  Yeah.  So then it turned out that steroids are only, testosterone, only one kind of steroid.  There's bazillions.  If you just take testosterone, you'll get big and hairy and horny.  You'll also retain water. 
[02:00:00]  So then you can take something else called windstraw that'll cut all that down.  But then you can take Clomax, which I took, that is a racehorse.  This is a fat burner for racehorses, which I took.  But then all of a sudden I started to shake real bad.  I didn't put two and two together.  And like, if I had to read a script of paper and my hand would shake, I'd have to put it  on the table so people wouldn't see.  Because then I've got to get through the next season of breaking Bonaduce before they know  that I have Parkinson's.  Yeah.  So then I go on the internet.  And that's actually a side effect of Clomax, that you have the symptoms of Parkinson's disease. 
[02:00:30]  Oh, man.  No.  Clombuterol.  That's it.  I'm sorry.  Clombuterol.  So I quit that.  Because it didn't look good at jobs for me to be shaking.  No, I haven't had a drink in years.  And I feel pretty good.  Probably spilling all over your cup.  Right on.  So that's how I started taking them.  The problem was, I didn't read how to stop taking them.  I just stopped taking them and all sorts of stuff happened.  Oh, what are you supposed to slowly wean yourself off of it?  And other stuff.  And in exchange of what happened is, I'd already given up alcohol.  And I'd already given up drugs.  And now your body is so full of fake testosterone for show bulls that your body doesn't manufacture 
[02:01:00]  any.  So now there's no chicks, there's no drugs, and there's no alcohol.  All there is in my life is pudding and ravioli.  And I just get fat like a friggin' pig.  And that's when I started hitting it again and eating right.  And now I think I look all right again.  So what happens to you when you go off the roids?  Obviously, your body goes to hell.  Your body goes to hell.  The only thing that bothered me is I lost my interest in sex, which kind of defines me  as a human being.  Good literature and better sex. 
[02:01:30]  Right.  I like to read books by authors I know and sleep with people I don't.  It's kind of my motive right there.  I think that came from being exposed to it.  It's such a young age.  Maybe.  I don't know.  Do you have something against it with strangers?  No, not at all.  Getting David Cassidy's throwaways for a while.  You know, I don't know that he threw them away.  I just think he was personally...  He just had an overabundance.  Yeah, he's more of the Salvation Army of getting the other guys sex.  He wasn't throwing them out.  He took them to the groupie bin, put them in, and I pulled them back out. 
[02:02:00]  Yeah, what is that?  How old were you when you lost it?  Lost my virginity?  Yeah.  I think I was 13, and it was to a David Cassidy cast off.  Yeah.  I read something about that.  It was, these chicks are lining outside this friggin' guy's door, right?  And his room is actually too full of chicks now.  He just can't possibly have any more sex.  What a problem.  I know.  Why didn't the show, like, have episodes like that?  Because you didn't do that.  I think Keith was still a virgin when we quit. 
[02:02:30]  But anyway, there's a full-grown woman, like, maybe 20 to 23 years old, and I'm 13.  And she gets cast away from David Cassidy's dressing room.  And I walk up to her, and I go, hi, I'm Danny.  And I swear to God, the chick goes for it.  And she thinks, I guess, you know, any partridge in a storm, all right.  And she takes me into my dressing room and makes a man out of me.  Wow.  And I would like to say that I gave this woman the best 30 seconds of her life.  But if you're out there, because you're probably 55 years old now, and you feel bad about that, 
[02:03:00]  I want you to know, I love you.  Oh, she's a cougar.  You were, she wasn't, she's a hot 23.  Well, now she's a cougar, though.  Now she's still banging on her.  She seemed like a real older woman to you.  If you've told that story, and now you're ashamed, don't be ashamed.  I think of you often.  I think you're a wonderful girl.  Yeah, it's a double standard, man.  When you've got an older woman banging you as a young teenager, you're bragging about it.  But if it's an older guy with like a girl that's 13 or 14, then everyone thinks you're a pedophile. 
[02:03:30]  Yeah, not only do you go to jail, but bad things happen to child molesters in jail.  I mean, you know, I got to tell you, you know, I've been arrested a couple of times.  Being an ex-child star, not that cool in jail.  You know, child molester really bad, but ex-child star, I think we go for like a carton of Marlboro in the shower room.  Okay, so you really have to be ready.  What problem do they have with you guys in jail?  To be honest, the same problem I have. 
[02:04:00]  I mean, the reason I think all ex-child stars that whine and bitch and complain, because I never whined and bitched and complained.  I wasn't getting high with the Bradys.  I was getting high with my dentist.  You know what I mean?  I never blamed show business.  And I think that was the difference between us.  They all sat and whined and complained, and I made some gags, and then I made a career again.  You think Mike Luckenlund would be brutally raped in jail?  Or how about Peter Knight?  Chris, Chris.  Oh, Chris Knight, yeah.  Dude, I just did a show with that guy and his wife, that Adrienne supermodel.  Yeah, yeah, we've had him on the show. 
[02:04:30]  And we did this thing called Celebrity Paranormal Project.  We were in this like spooky prison.  And the first thing I said is, why would you put me in a place where I'm quite comfortable?  The thing I'm most afraid of is getting my old room back.  But it was their bodies buried.  It was really scary.  So they sent me and Adrienne supermodel out on our own, and she has a nervous breakdown.  This is on, by the way, right after Breaking Modeling Sunday nights on VH1.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  I appreciate you letting me do that.  You've done radio long enough.  You know how to do it. 
[02:05:00]  I don't need to set you up.  I have to do it.  So we're out there, and she's having a nervous freaking breakdown.  She's not kidding.  She's freaking out.  And I said, and I'm not.  I looked at her and I said, can you hear them?  And she goes, yes, I can.  They're speaking.  I said, I can hear them.  You know, it's been a male prison for so long.  They've been locked near all these other men.  They're telling me that the only way to appease them is if you give me oral sex.  And I swear to God, I say that to her on camera, and her husband's going to see it next Sunday night. 
[02:05:30]  But I mean, what the hell's Peter Brady going to do?  What's he going to do about stick his father on you?  I already beat him.  Yeah, yes.  He's a big boy, too.  I already beat the bejesus out of his big brother.  But Christopher Knight, he's jacked.  I don't know if he knows the martial arts, but...  You know what?  Everybody I know now has a black belt in karate.  Yeah.  And I will tell you to put an end to that, ultimate fighting.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  You walk up and say, I have a black belt.  I know how to throw triple round kicks and jump up in the air.  An ultimate fight will grab you out of the sky and beat you to death for having a bad attitude. 
[02:06:00]  Chuck Liddell, man.  He was in studio.  Animal.  There's black belts, and then there's tough men.  And those guys can take a beating, too, is what it is.  Do you know in the pilot episode of Breaking Bonaducey, and you don't see it because he  didn't sign a waiver, I actually punched a UFC fighter in the face without knowing who  he was, and I leveled him, too.  I mean, he got back up.  This is a Danny Bonaducey school of bar fighting, by the way.  No matter how big the guy is, if he said something offensive enough that you want to hit him,  you get close to him, tag him in the face as hard as you can, and then wrap your arms 
[02:06:30]  around him and follow him to the floor, and security will be there in two seconds, and  you'll have won that fight.  And we're at the Palms Casino in Vegas, and this guy comes up to me and goes, hey, what  are you going to do celebrity boxing versus average Joe?  And there were people around.  I don't know if it takes that crap.  Plus, it was my size.  I didn't know UFC fighters came in sizes.  I thought they were all giant.  So I said, why?  You know an average Joe you think could do it?  Being all badass.  And he goes, I'll do it.  I'll do it right now. 
[02:07:00]  And I said, fine.  What's in it for me?  I got $100,000 for fighting Greg Brady.  What do you got?  Nothing.  You're just not mad at it.  And my cameras were rolling, and it was my pilot.  And plus, he defended me now.  Because I'm executive producer, so I could have cut it out.  Yeah.  But now I'm offended, so I look at him, and I go, all right, I'll tell you what.  I just won at Roulette.  I've got $10,000 in my front pocket.  All you have to do is get it, and you win.  And he moved a step forward, and I went, boom!  And I dropped him in security game and all this stuff, and that's when everybody told 
[02:07:30]  me, dude, that's a UFC champ.  He'd have killed you.  And I went, well, let's get the hell out of the palms, then, and get over to that castle-shaped  place.  That's, wow.  Yeah, another UFC fighter in one hit.  But I'm not trying to be badass.  So you just watched that all the time?  He'd have gotten up and killed me.  Oh, absolutely.  Oh, absolutely.  Well, did you ever, there's other people you might want to punch, like DJs in Chicago.  Did that ever happen?  There is still an outline of it, Jackie.  Yeah.  You see, I don't want to come off as too violent here, because I've got a weird little  issue with this breaking Bonaduce thing that I think I've got covered, but unfortunately 
[02:08:00]  in the wrong career.  Radio guys, not like you guys, but I mean programmers, are terrified of me.  Now, here's a question, how do you get a guy that's so dangerously unstable that gives  you the biggest show you've ever had, and then say, I know, let's give him a bunch of  money, and we'll spend millions making it, we'll do it again.  So somebody must have been in control, probably me.  The second thing is, I'm now a regular character on CSI, which costs $15 million per episode, 
[02:08:30]  and they keep having me back because they dig me.  So here's the question that arises, am I the out-of-control lunatic from Breaking Bonaduce?  Or am I the consummate professional from CSI?  And the answer is both.  Absolutely.  Just give me your money and tell me which guy to bring to work in the morning.  There you go.  Radio just stinks.  You don't want to be back here.  No, yes, I do.  I hate acting.  And you've got to stay off, you know.  It just stinks.  I can't bear it.  You're actually, I have an audition today, and I just don't like acting either. 
[02:09:00]  I don't like it.  No.  I like game shows, and I like talk shows.  I don't like it.  I like talk shows, because that's kind of like radio, but I don't like acting.  You know, I'm laying on the table in CSI while they're doing my autopsy for two days on a  cold steel thing, not saying anything.  That's lame ass.  I had some good dead guy jokes.  I was laying there.  Must have been a few people, though, that looked and went, boy, would I love to see that in  real life.  Like, that's how I got my second job back.  They kill me in the first episode in, like, the first two seconds, and apparently they 
[02:09:30]  got a bunch of mail from people saying, Danny Bonaduce has been trying to get killed for  years.  Can we see more of that?  So they wrote it in, and I came back and showed more reasons why you want to kill me.  In that one, there was a lot of dialogue, which I did word for word, and they said,  oh, great, then somebody gave them copies of Breaking Bonaduce, and the director said,  well, nobody told me he could do that.  Let's get him back and do some of that.  So I'm now not only a semi-regular, but I have the distinction of being the only murder 
[02:10:00]  on CSI in the seven-year history of the show that my murder is not solved.  We still don't know who did it, and that's the only time ever in the history of the show.  That's awesome.  Hey, what are we expecting from the second season?  Because there's a conflict there.  I mean, the first season ended with you all cleaned up and stuff, you know?  All right.  I will tell you that.  And when are you going to punch the therapist in the face?  Please say you do it.  I'll tell you what happened, because I have not seen it, but I just heard a clip not too  long ago, and he said something I don't like, and I say, if you say that again, and he's  a big, ripped guy, he's one of those muscle queens. 
[02:10:30]  I'm just guessing.  I'm not guessing about all the Botox in his face.  I'm willing to go to the mat on that one.  But muscle queen, I may have to, you know, litigate.  So I'm saying allegedly he's on fire at the show.  In your opinion.  In my opinion.  They show this on the first episode of the Senate.  And I say, if you say that to me again, you better be big enough to get out of that chair  and back it up.  And he doesn't.  You know, he throws in that he's a therapist.  Well, here are your options. 
[02:11:00]  Be a therapist or be a dead therapist.  All up to you.  Did you get picked on when you were, you know, doing the Partridge family?  No.  But you didn't at all?  I mean, people hassled me and yelled stuff at me.  But, like, as a kid, did I get beat up and stuff?  Yeah, like, you know, because kids kind of get jealous or something.  Did you go to regular school or was it on the lot?  I went to regular school up until the Partridge family was over.  And then I went to Cal Prep where the graduating class, dig this, was me, Michael Jackson, and  Christian Brando.  And out of the three of us, I have the best reputation. 
[02:11:30]  That's pretty cool.  Goddamn, that speaks volumes.  Yeah, it does.  You're a very honest guy, man.  It's really, it's what makes for great television.  You really tell the truth.  It also makes for, if you're going to be like me and absolutely not by the rules, if you,  you know how sometimes you get a terrible idea and in the back of your head the little  voices don't do that?  Yeah, yeah.  I don't have that.  Yeah.  I just, I don't have that.  Yeah, you shouldn't like stomp on cakes or anything.  Right.  Exactly.  So if I am going to live the way I live, then if I was ashamed of it, I wouldn't do it. 
[02:12:00]  So no, I don't have a single spot.  But you're also smart.  You understand what makes really good TV as well.  Yes, I do.  And that.  You know the business.  That luckily has translated into a lot of TV work.  It's just, it's not what I want to do.  Right.  Radio is what I do.  Acting is like, you know, if Eric Strada can do it, I can do it.  Right.  You know what I mean?  So they write your words for you.  They put your name on your chair just in case you can't figure out where to sit.  It's not a job for grownups.  Radio rocks.  Unfortunately, only TV guys looked and went, all right, as a human being, that guy's a 
[02:12:30]  dismal failure.  But as an executive producer, Panaducci's a genius.  So I've got, for the next three months, two to three months, I've got three different  shows on Sunday nights running against each other on two networks.  That's awesome.  Yeah.  But I don't want to do it.  I want my radio job.  What's going to happen with you and your wife in the end?  In the end, I can't, of course, tell you.  No, not the second.  I'm saying in the end, as far as when the TV cameras are off and it's over, the show  is done with.  Do you really see yourself getting old with her? 
[02:13:00]  Yes.  I've been married to her for 15 years, coming up on 16, and she is absolutely the only woman  I have ever loved since.  And this amazes me.  Since doing the show, it has occurred to me that she does, in fact, have flaws.  Like, I think of her as the girl who took care of me, pulled me out of the gutter, made  me okay, you know, did everything wonderful to me.  But I get a lot of mail about that she's really cold and distant to you and treats you with  disdain.  I see that part of it.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:13:30]  I get mad.  I'm there sticking up for you.  By the way, she answers all her mail at Danny Bonaducey's official MySpace page.  Feel free to tell her that she comes off a little cold.  Yeah.  Because she doesn't believe it.  She doesn't believe it.  Because she's very religious and very sweet, would never tell you a lie, and I'm this drunk  kind of maniac on the show.  I feel it's my job to deliver.  Yeah.  Here's what happened.  Danny the maniac is sober.  Danny the drunk sits in a chair with a book, usually a fine book, and I drink till I pass 
[02:14:00]  out in a lazy boy.  Then I go out stone sober and do crazy stuff because I like it.  I think it's fun.  I don't want to live anybody else's life.  I don't want to go, ooh, there are the red lights.  That's different.  I want to live whatever way I want.  And VH1 thought, you know, you drunk and a lazy boy with Tolstoy, not that much of a  show.  So when they added movement to the drunkenness, things went a little crazier than I had anticipated.  The skateboards.  Let's put them out in public.  The skateboards, he was badass, huh?  Yeah.  Badass. 
[02:14:30]  Did you take a little luck to see what was coming, though?  No.  I didn't think they had anything.  A little peek, like, I think I can make this.  No, because what would it matter?  Well, I don't want to see it coming.  If I wasn't going to make it, I wasn't going to make it.  That is awesome, man.  I love it.  Everybody should have an employee as loyal as me.  Right.  You know, never miss the day of work.  I've missed two days of work and 16 years of morning radio.  Two days out of 16 years, and I've been late for work two days.  Yeah, why do they fire you?  It was a great channel, right?  Yeah.  To be honest with you, here's my belief.  And they ended up paying me a fortune. 
[02:15:00]  They made a bad call.  What happened was, I worked with a partner who did fart jokes, never read a book in her  life, didn't read the newspaper, just wasn't prepared.  And what it was, was her fart jokes versus my life with a normal family and craziness,  but being really updated on what was going on, made for a very funny show.  When they found a way to get out of me, what they thought, without costing them a million  dollars, they took it because they thought the fart joke girl was the show.  Oh, boy.  They were in the number one position when I left. 
[02:15:30]  They're 24th in the morning now.  Of course they are.  Good.  Thank you very much.  Of course they are.  Thank you very much.  With that, we have to wrap up this part of the show.  We're going over to XM now.  You're a comic list.  Oh, you're right.  You're a comic tonight and tomorrow night.  I'm a comic tonight, C-O-M-I-X-N-Y.com for tickets.  Please come out.  I really appreciate you guys.  You've been really kind to me, and I cannot tell you how much I appreciate it.  Great over the years, though.  Now, just tell your friggin' boss to give me a job or I'll set this house on fire.  Come on.  And don't forget, the O.P. and Anthony Halloween Party is brought to you by Saw 3. 
[02:16:00]  If it's Halloween, it must be Saw in theaters everywhere Friday, and we'll have more info  on the Halloween Party tomorrow.  And New Year's Eve, I'm at the Borgata, so if you want to get tickets, get tickets.  Borgata Casino on New Year's Eve.  Neat.  Danny, thank you so much.  Thank you, guys.  Again.  Danny Bonaduce, everyone.  I can walk on my hands.  I can fart and chew gum.  I play the oboe. 
[02:16:30]  I can ride a unicycle.  I wear a bra and lace panties.  So your talent is being queer, Travis?  It's the O.P. and Anthony Walkover Talent Show.  If you have a unique skill, talent, music group, or physical affliction we want to exploit,  you can email steve at foundrymusic.com with your ideas, or you can just show up during  the walk to XM and start shucking and jiving.  Shucking and jiving?  Jesus, Danny.  I don't write this sh**.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  The O.P. and Anthony XM Walkover begins now. 
[02:17:00]  I got to deal with this sh** now.  Great.  Oh, boy.  There's conflict in front of the station.  Freak, Kenny.  Kenny, it's a public street.  My hands are in my pockets.  I'm not threatening anybody, and I'm not going to be intimidated by you.  I came here to call O.P. out.  I've done that, and now you're running your mouth.  Yeah.  That's all.  All right.  So do me a favor.  You can't disturb us while we're broadcasting.  I'm not disturbing anybody.  I'm standing here.  You guys started broadcasting after I started to talk. 
[02:17:30]  Why don't you take a walk by yourself?  Be a gentleman.  He doesn't like that I jumped on Andrew's cake yesterday.  Yeah.  He doesn't.  Broadcasting is all about talking, isn't it?  Yeah, but it's his show, not yours.  O.P., you want to talk about this or not?  He does have the...  You've got a mic in your face.  He does have the right...  That's what I'm talking about.  He does have the right to disagree.  We'd be hypocrites if we said, look, this isn't a faceless name.  Couseless, nameless guy that's commenting on it.  He's come down.  He doesn't like what happened yesterday.  Bill Hughes.  I live in Hackensack, New Jersey. 
[02:18:00]  And in relation...  Stan, he's got his shirt off.  And I came down today to tell Opie that he did the wrong thing with Andrew yesterday.  He took somebody who's down on the balls of their ass who earned a cake for himself,  probably the biggest prize he's had in a long time, and he stomped on it for him.  That's all.  I mean, even Jimmy walked away from that.  Wrong.  Jimmy walked away and then had the biggest laugh he's had in a year.  I can't deny it.  I don't have a good laugh about it, but when you look at that video and you look how crushed  that man is, you could cross the line from cringe humor to sociopath, and that's what 
[02:18:30]  I'm talking about.  Thank you for promoting the video.  It's up on YouTube.  It is.  It's up on YouTube.  Watch it.  It's horrendous.  All right.  Well, I will say again, at least the guy came down.  He's not being here.  And we always say, you know...  Face to face.  I'm a big fan of the show.  We always say that.  But that's the thing that goes from cringe to sociopath.  Everyone's got their lines.  And you said you're a big fan.  Everyone's got their lines.  I guess we crossed yours.  Yeah.  I guess you slid over his.  I found it.  Forward about an inch.  All right, guys.  Have a good walk and joy.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  I appreciate what you do for these guys. 
[02:19:00]  All right.  The guy came up like a gentleman, spoke his piece.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Bye.  I don't care.  I don't care.  Wait.  We have...  Opie, we have something.  Somebody brought something here.  Who cares?  What?  Get her to come.  Oh, my God.  This cake thing has taken on a life of its own.  What is that that you have there?  Danny bought a ducie.  Oh, my God.  I baked a cake for Opie to give to Andrew or a cream burger.  She actually brought a cake and she baked herself.  Oh.  She made a man. 
[02:19:30]  Oh, wow.  It's just like the cake we just brought.  No, I mean, it's warm still.  Oh, it is.  It's nice.  That is a good-looking cake.  What's in there?  Raisins?  Raisins and cinnamon and white chocolate and just lots of good.  Any nuts?  What a nice girl.  Oh, no, nuts is good.  I hate nuts.  I'm not going to eat it, but I'd hate if he was allergic and we found him dead there.  So it's still warm when we get to Andrew.  When you want to smash it, you can.  I don't care.  No.  Give it to him.  I would do it twice.  It's too predictable.  It's been done.  It's been done, right. 
[02:20:00]  Did you see Danny?  Why did Danny have his shirt off before?  I don't know.  Have you seen his build?  Yeah.  Bastard, I know.  If you look like that, you'd walk around the middle of winter with your shirt off.  What fine abs he has.  I wanted to talk to him about Pilates, but I was afraid he'd kick me in the face.  That's right.  Master Poe is now stalking.  Master Poe is, sir.  Master Poe is stalking.  Where is he?  It's fine.  What is Chuck like?  Did you get his coffee?  No one gave a shit.  He actually said to me.  The guy just wanted to fuck him.  I don't want you to go from cringe to sociopath. 
[02:20:30]  Shut up.  You should have said, sorry, that happened years ago, sir.  Yeah, you never weren't a sociopath.  You never weren't.  That was just...  Andrew made a lot of money off us yesterday.  Fucking lunatic.  A lot of money.  Where's Andrew?  I wish he was here today.  He's not here.  I wish there was something else we could take.  He's not here, is he?  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  That cake is there.  Oh, what are these guys handing out?  That cake is the...  Oh, boy.  What's this?  Oh, no.  Zipcar?  Oh, Zipcar.  Some sort of an Asian thing.  I like the Zipcar. 
[02:21:00]  You guys are XM.  We're XM, man.  Zipcar's got XM radio in it.  What is a Zipcar, sir?  Zipcar rocks.  Let me explain Zipcar.  Urban car sharing.  Aren't you hip?  No.  What is it, mister?  Dude, you can rent a car and then pretty much drop it off wherever the hell you want.  No, no, no.  They go back to the same place, right?  Oh.  I thought you were going to drop it off in the project.  But for $10 an hour, we'll get your gas, we'll get your insurance, and we've got a speed  pass and XM radio in there for you.  Very nice.  Free XM radio.  Every Zipcar, guys. 
[02:21:30]  Wow.  So what the hell are you doing?  Mr. Lee said good gas prices.  Well, it doesn't matter.  You guys pay for the gas.  We pay for the gas.  It doesn't matter.  And the insurance?  And the insurance.  Oh, mister.  Completely unlimited.  You go where you want to go.  But what if I want to just drive like a bunch of miles?  Drive them.  How would I get my Zipcar?  Zipcar.  Zipcar.com.  Oh, cut it out.  Zipcar.com.  Sign up online.  It's the quickest way to go.  And, Mike, if I decide to just hop up on the sidewalk and run a bunch of people over,  the insurance is taken care of?  All covered.  Wow.  All covered. 
[02:22:00]  I actually like this.  All covered.  You can go out there and joyride your ass up.  That's cool.  Let me ask you a question.  Like, say that you want to go visit some transgendered friends, but not with your own car.  Can you get a Zipcar to do that?  Hell yeah.  Oh, of course you can.  Hell yeah.  And you can change it up every time so you don't get spotted going there with the same  car.  Nice.  Very good.  There you go.  This guy knows.  It's the Irving solution for you guys.  Thank you, Zipcar gentlemen.  You're giving out the cake?  I'm going to have a piece of cake.  No, I can't.  I've got to do a piece of cake.  I appreciate it.  You're welcome.  It's cold out.  I wouldn't eat that. 
[02:22:30]  I ate it first.  I'm going to have a teeny sliver.  Oh, you did eat it first?  Okay.  Did she really take a bite of her own cake?  I did.  I did.  She might have an antidote that she took earlier.  I know Natalia.  I wouldn't eat anything from anybody.  What's the white stuff?  It's egg white.  Not like I'm eating anything.  Egg white in the middle of the cake?  Yeah, because it makes it golden brown, but it didn't work out.  I made it fast.  Is that the worst cake ever, Jimmy?  Jimmy's spitting out the cake.  Jimmy's spitting it out in the gutter of the street.  Jimmy just spit it out in the gutter.  Oh, boy.  Bill Hughes has a problem with that, too. 
[02:23:00]  Of course he does.  I'll tell her.  Where is he?  He has the same last name as me.  Is he a relative, Opie?  Fuck no.  Is he a relative?  He probably is, because I do have a few answers.  My parents and uncles that don't like the show.  Yeah, don't you love those?  That is...  I was listening, and I didn't go shit in your hat.  What?  That is the worst cake I've ever had in my life.  Oh, my God.  I'm sorry.  Did I throw it away?  It's the worst cake.  I thought you spit it out.  If Andrew...  I would never spit out cake.  If Andrew got that, he would have built a new house out of it.  It's the driest...  Is that horrid? 
[02:23:30]  Dryest cake.  I made it in 20 minutes.  I've seen Jimmy not spit out jism.  And he spit out your cake.  Wait a minute.  Could you just throw that cake on my back?  That is...  I'm 38.  I've never eaten worse cake.  And my mother's not a good cook.  The worst cake you've ever had.  It tastes like cinnamon meatloaf.  Oh, you're making Bill Hughes laugh.  Oh, come here.  Don't you have a cinnamon meatloaf.  Die.  Pigeons like it?  No, the pigeons like it.  Not happy.  Go away.  No, you should...  We should have somebody else try it. 
[02:24:00]  Try it.  Yes, we should.  It's not unhealthy.  It's just terrible.  Miss, do you want some dry cake?  Yes.  All right, let's try to give away some cake.  You guys want to go to Starbucks today?  It's cold.  It's cold, Opie.  Come on, I want to go inside.  I need coffee.  I need coffee.  Come on.  I need some coffee.  We'll send people for coffee.  That's what we do.  Fucking Bill Hughes.  I can't believe how dry that fucking cake is.  Your pal Bill Hughes?  He set you straight, Opie.  He sure set you on the straight and narrow.  I'm sure he'll be listening to this on the replay. 
[02:24:30]  Yes, you too, Kenny.  My place.  He wasn't intimidated by the likes of you.  He had his hands in his pockets and was taking a non-threatening stance.  You could have clocked him right in the face and he'd have fallen backwards and couldn't  get his hands out of his pocket.  We got two homeless people over there.  Fracture his skull.  Let's watch them spit out the first meal they've had in weeks.  No, I don't think so.  I'm listening.  That cake.  I'm listening, Jimmy.  That cake.  Oh, what's going on over there?  We're going to...  Jimmy just said it, Anthony. 
[02:25:00]  We're going to feed that cake to the homeless people.  This is a very nice girl.  That looks like...  She made some cake.  I've never had worse cake.  Did they float up here from Louisiana?  I've probably been eating cakes since I was four.  Look at them.  They look like jazz artists.  I'm sorry.  That's all right.  Don't be...  Oh, my God.  It's the thought that counts.  Two conversations going on at the same time.  I know.  Jesus.  Oh, God.  They're not homeless.  Hello, gentlemen.  That's English from Escape Pop.  How are you, sirs?  Very good.  There's two reasons you didn't sit on my step.  Why are you guys sitting on the corner?  I'm working right here. 
[02:25:30]  Oh, okay.  All right.  I didn't see your...  Oh, he's got some scarves.  I didn't see your setup there, sir.  Cashmere scarves for sale.  My QB.  Opie and Anthony.  Exactly.  You don't know.  We're a radio show.  It's a radio show.  Sir, we had a woman bring us some cake, and I had a piece.  Would you like a piece of the driest cake anybody's ever made?  No, thank you.  It's really bad.  Mister, can I interest you in a piece of the driest, most awful cake anybody's ever made?  No, thank you.  All right.  They don't even want it.  Look at the white stuff.  There's egg whites in it. 
[02:26:00]  What are you...  Ugh.  You're not supposed to show that.  Looks like somebody fucked your cake.  Let's ask Bill if this is safe radio, if this is safe enough radio for him.  She could...  Is that an egg white?  Oh, God.  What did you do?  There's still a pothole with it.  What did you do?  You didn't stir it up.  No, I didn't.  I was...  I poured it on.  I forgot to.  I was turned around.  Oh, my God.  Oh, I love her.  She's a junkie who makes cake.  She's the greatest.  Junkie.  I don't know what happened.  My baby...  I didn't feed it for a few weeks.  Oh, my God. 
[02:26:30]  No, we want you to...  I gotta go.  No, no, no.  You're fantastic.  Your cake's awful.  Come on.  Your cake is awful.  You're a good person.  There's a Zip Cars guy again.  Zip Cars.  Another Zip Cars.  We talked to the other Zip Cars guy.  Got all the info.  Dry cake coming through.  Dry cake coming through.  Miss, would you like the driest cake anybody's ever made?  This woman made cake.  It's inedible.  You can't give that away.  No, you can't.  Where are they from?  I'm sure they're from out of country.  Yes. 
[02:27:00]  Australia, perhaps.  I'm too cold to do this walk.  This sucks now.  All right.  I just want to be warm.  That's my stomach after eating that shit cake.  One, two, three.  Jimmy.  What?  There's more of the cake sitting behind the desk over here, but it's got a tie on it.  Oh, my God.  Jimmy.  Oh, hold on.  Someone brought me a gift.  What is it, sir?  I'm doing it.  What do you got? 
[02:27:30]  Stable and right, bro?  Oh, thanks, man.  Cool.  Very nice.  I appreciate it.  All right.  I just dropped it on the ground.  Mike, there is.  Wait a minute.  Somebody did leave a big pile of that cake with monkey cum in it.  There's a pile of that cake with monkey cum in it behind the desk.  Why did somebody throw their tie in a cake?  I don't get it.  That is silly.  Why would anyone throw their tie in a cake?  I don't know.  Hi, sir.  Good morning to you.  And we will see you upstairs. 
[02:28:00]  They are the most vile, despicable human beings in the country.  Creeps.  Ankle biters.  Obviously, the strength is their ability to turn mistruth into something people would believe.  Wow.  How long is this guy going to continue to babble and say nothing?  All day long.  Shut up.  All right.  Here we go.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[02:28:30]  It's worse than I imagined.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  We are a bunch of dopes.  I think we're lewd.  We're probably pushing 20 arrests because of this radio show.  Out of touch.  Corn balls.  Three retards.  We have the effect of talent all PM.  Opie.  You know I could have been a model.  Anthony.  I'm dead.  James Norton.  I like yogurt.  Robert Reed.  But enough of this palaver. 
[02:29:00]  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.

[02:29:30]  guitar solo 
[02:30:00]  guitar solo 
[02:30:30]  We were getting our shit together there for a second.  Have to do that.  Yep.  Welcome, everybody, to the XM portion of the Opie and Anthony program.  The virus, if you will. 
[02:31:00]  I can read it.  I know this is a virus.  I see the sign right there.  Right there.  Right there.  I hold in my hand the December issue of FHM magazine.  Nice.  Remember that photo shoot for Thanksgiving we did?  I certainly do.  I got turkey juice spilt on my arm.  Did you?  Yes.  You all right?  I'm fine.  Oh, sweetie.  Don't worry me.  Well, uh...  Heavy turkey.  The issue is going to be on newsstands on, uh, what? 
[02:31:30]  What?  Monday?  Tuesday?  What did Steve just tell me?  I forgot.  A week?  It's going to be on newsstands.  When?  I don't know.  Everyone's just staring at me, so I don't know.  We don't know.  Somebody better get Steve back in here before Steve gets a good firing.  It's going to be the December issue of FHM magazine.  Next week.  Next week.  Sometime next week, this will hit newsstands.  It's, uh, and I holding up, uh, a nice cooked turkey.  Oh.  And we're ready to serve it to our boys.  Patrice O'Neill, Rich Voss, Bob Kelly, Bill Burr, Otto, and George. 
[02:32:00]  And, and little Jimmy Norton at the head of the table there.  Oh.  And then there's another great picture of, um...  Oh, Jesus.  Of, uh, and I carving the turkey.  And, uh, Jimmy with his plate up, ready to receive a fine piece of turkey.  I can't...  Turkey.  The pictures are deeply disturbing.  Could he ship...  What page?  Page, uh, 78.  Couldn't they have put you on the cover, at least the names? 
[02:32:30]  They should have done this.  Wow.  Mm-hmm.  That's a, that's a good photo, huh?  It's a great photo.  Oh, my God.  Except for dumb Patrice looking off in the wrong direction.  Me, Bobby, Voss, and Billy, we're all staring one way.  Otto, Patrice, even the puppets looking the right way.  Yeah.  Stupid Otto and Patrice are looking the wrong way.  What are they looking at?  I don't know.  They're looking at us.  That, we have the turkey.  It kind of works.  Some of you guys are looking this way.  The other two are looking at, uh, and I as we hold up the turkey. 
[02:33:00]  Dummy in the middle saying, eh, what do you want?  See, they made this look like we're all in the same shot, even though we did it separately.  Yeah.  Who's that sweet boy waiting for a piece of turkey?  All right.  This is pretty cool.  He's a sweet boy.  This is pretty cool.  Wow.  This is a picture of, uh, yeah, like I said, us carving the turkey.  Jesus.  Nice picture.  And then another one with, uh, Patrice, Bill Burr, Rich Voss, Bob Kelly with a guitar, 
[02:33:30]  and Otto and George.  It looks like they're singing a, uh, a Thanksgiving song.  What a bunch of tools.  Oh, my God.  It does.  It looks like they're singing.  Yeah.  Oh, with those awful sweaters.  Yeah.  We look just horrific.  This is so.  All right.  Well, it'll be on newsstands next week.  The December issue of FHM Magazine. 
[02:34:00]  The most unrealistic part of this whole thing.  A black man joining white people.  Oh, stop.  Oh, come on now, Anthony.  I'll be politically correct.  I don't want to piss off Bill Hughes.  Oh, he got you.  He knows a thing or two about a thing or two.  Yeah.  Yeah, because he was there yesterday.  He knows exactly what happened, right?  Of course he does.  Before, during, and after, right?  You know everything.  Fuck him.  Just by listening to the radio. 
[02:34:30]  That's what I say.  Yeah, P. Hart from Jersey.  I get it.  I'm weak.  What?  What?  This guy, P. Hart, is obsessed with, uh...  You're not allowed anymore to read instant feedbacks.  He's just obsessed with, uh, trying to get to me.  You're not allowed?  P. Hart from Jersey.  Opie, you are weak.  What does that mean?  Why would you allow some anonymous faggot?  Does he use his real name?  He wants acknowledgement.  There you go.  There you go, P. Hart.  Now what?  Now what? 
[02:35:00]  Now what?  Opie, small, angry man.  Keep going.  You're just giving him a forum.  Do I want anything?  Yes, I do!  What do you want there, Jimmy?  I want, and I mean this...  Gee, do you need any more fucking almonds?  I have almonds because they're healthy.  Where's my sister?  There are four bins of almonds.  I want one of the interns to have a piece of that cake. 
[02:35:30]  Oh, shit.  It's not unhealthy.  They're not going to hurt you.  That horrid cake?  But I want someone to give another opinion on that cake, just so you don't think I'm being a dick.  I don't need the likes of Bill.  You is bothering me.  No.  He'll show you.  I got to whisper something, I can't.  Oh.  Opie, what are you whispering?  Opie, I want to know.  Opie, can I know?  No, you can't.  Opie, can you tell me?  That's what the whisper is about, Jimmy.  Opie, can you tell me?  The whisper is about that. 
[02:36:00]  Opie, can I know?  Oh, hey, look at that.  We got an intern.  We got a piece of that shit cake.  Is it really that bad?  It's just an odd, there's something missing from it besides flavor.  Like maybe water?  Yeah, can you explain the cake now that we're comfortable sitting down here in our studio?  Yeah.  Hold on, Mike.  Well, no, it doesn't want you there.  Give her a microphone.  Well, no one sits there because it's broken.  Someone get her a mic.  You get her a microphone.  Okay.  And there you go.  Now, do you cook? 
[02:36:30]  Yeah, I do.  I usually make really good food.  You do?  I didn't try it before.  What do you usually make?  What do you usually make?  Well, I make cheese.  I make chicken and...  Like it in pie.  I make...  No.  I make pear pie, actually.  What?  Pear pie.  Pear pie.  I make with garlic pears and confectioners and sugar.  Pear pie.  Pear pie.  And then...  And I make steak.  I make stuffed bell pepper.  Well, that's a mistake. 
[02:37:00]  Well, but do you bake?  Yes.  You bake a lot.  Yeah, well, I bake...  How does a girl that bakes not stir up the...  No, I didn't.  Okay, what happened was I wanted to put egg white on top of the cake because that makes  it gives that glaze, like that glazed look like over...  Right, right.  I've seen it done on cooking shows where they take some egg white on a...  I was in a rush and I forgot and I put it in a jar and I forgot to whisk it before.  Whisk it?  Whisk it.  You didn't whisk your cake. 
[02:37:30]  I didn't whisk it.  So you should have whisked the egg white.  Yeah, I did.  I just would blah all over it.  But you're only supposed to use a little bit.  It looks like scrambled egg whites are in there.  It's amazing.  It's really awful and I just...  Well, at least I got here before you guys left.  I'm usually pretty late for things.  And Jimmy had a taste out on the street.  It smelled very good.  But you had a mouthful and I've never seen this before.  Jimmy spit out cake.  We all know how Jimmy adores cake. 
[02:38:00]  In school, I was voted boy most likely to eat all his cake.  And you probably had cake that was better than some other cakes.  But then you had this and spit it out into the gutter of 57th Street.  And as the old saying goes, not all cake is going to be great cake.  Who hasn't heard that?  No.  You know, some cake tastes like asshole.  That's a lot of seconds ago.  That's a very...  My grandmother would say that occasionally.  Well, unless you were baking... 
[02:38:30]  Were you baking asshole cake, ma'am?  No.  Okay, then there's no excuse.  My grandmother...  I could see if it was asshole cake.  If you ask any of my friends who've eaten my food, they all say I'm the greatest cook.  My grandmother once said to me...  Yes, they do.  My mother's not a good cake maker.  No.  My grandmother once said, Jim, better you eat the cunt of a cadaver than your mother's cake.  I said Nana.  I don't think that's accurate.  But she said to me, no, no, it's accurate.  The cunt of a body tastes better than your mother's cake. 
[02:39:00]  Oh, my God.  All right, then.  Nana had a real cake issue.  And how does that cake...  She brought my mother over and frosted it.  How does that cake compare to your cake?  What's your name?  I'm sorry.  Andrea.  Andrea.  Where are you from, Andrea?  Originally Oakland, California.  Oh, I hear the accent.  There you go.  And then how does it compare to her cake?  This tasted very much not as good as Mama's cake, but drier. 
[02:39:30]  So it was basically like cadaver cunt without the moisture that you typically would associate  with the vagina of a dead body.  All right.  It's not even like, oh, it tastes gross.  It doesn't taste gross in the sense that you're like, I ate poison or I ate shit.  It's just, it's offensive to your senses because you're eating something that is devoid of texture  and flavor.  It's as if it was a cake that was sent through a Brundle's machine in the fly. 
[02:40:00]  And then it comes out the other end like the steak did.  And it looks like cake, but the taste is off.  Somebody faxed me a cake.  All right.  Well, uh, son.  We're not going to get sick, man.  I had a bite.  It's not like that type of awful.  Wow.  What's your name again?  I'm Craig.  He's Craig.  Yeah, yeah.  Craig.  The one who sucked the hernia.  Why should I know that?  Love your list.  Why do people get surprised when I have no idea what these fucking guys' names are? 
[02:40:30]  He's, uh, he's been doing some good stuff for us.  I don't, what?  Trying to.  He, uh, he sucked on the herniation.  What?  Of Rhonda?  Oh.  He's the one who got pwned.  He got pwned?  Pwned, right.  Okay.  What pwned mean?  He, uh, he has a video that made it to break.com that got over a quarter million hits within  four days.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, that was a huge, uh, he was, uh, the star of a huge Opie and Anthony, uh, video.  Yeah.  How, how can I tie his name into that, though?  Um, well, I just know, because when I search on YouTube, it says Craig sucks the herniation. 
[02:41:00]  Okay.  Big Rhonda.  Craig egg.  That's right.  I'll think that.  It looked like a big egg coming out of her belly that he sucked on.  There you go.  Craig, Craig, he's a dreg.  I like that, too.  Well, Craig's got a piece of that cake in his hand.  Ooh, looks so tasty.  Doesn't it?  It smells good, too.  And it smells good.  That's what Jimmy said.  It smells like cinnamon.  Yeah, just shove the whole thing in your mouth and chew it down.  All right.  Yeah.  Ooh, the whole piece.  Oh, fuck.  I think what I heard is, oh, it sucks. 
[02:41:30]  It really sucks.  Is it, is it really dry?  No.  You can spit it out.  No, you can't.  No, no.  Eat your cake.  It's harmless.  Eat your goddamn cake.  That's right.  And then clean the pots and pans with it.  Is it, you can't even, like, he can't even chew it.  It's, it is soaked up.  No water for him.  No water.  It is soaked up every bit of saliva he had in his mouth.  He's actually going to be eight pounds when he's done it because of all the blood.  It's like chewing.  Listen to him trying to talk.  He's got no moisture left in his mouth. 
[02:42:00]  Your cake sucks.  Holy shit.  It's cake and anti-cakes.  If you put this next to a real cake, the world would explode.  Wow.  Oh, he's coughing eyes.  He has got no moisture left in his body.  He's eating, like, thick salt and crackers.  Yeah.  Listen to him trying to work up moisture.  You're hurting her feelings, though.  I'm sorry.  Andrea.  Andrea, what's up with the cake? 
[02:42:30]  What happened with the dry cake?  Oh, man.  I was in a rush.  I'm sorry.  And I thought you were going to stamp on it, honestly.  How big a hurry are you in where you forget all moisture?  Yeah.  I didn't.  I put milk in it and I put butter in it.  Great.  She thought it was going to be a Sahara cake.  She actually made it so it would be perfectly crumbleable.  If you would have stepped on it, it would have been like you jumped in drywall.  A big cloud of dust.  What am I, Gallagher?  Now they can bring cakes every day?  They're going to bring food for you to ruin.  Oh, sorry.  What the hell have I become? 
[02:43:00]  I think he's getting it down.  How are you doing?  Not bad.  Now you've just got to get all the dry from between your cheek and gum.  It's like Skoll.  Happy days are Copenhagen.  Except all you get from that is gums cancer.  This has an aftertaste.  And aren't you supposed to like just kind of brush on the egg white?  Yes, I messed up.  Oh, okay.  You really messed up.  I did.  You messed up with the ingredients because it would have...  It's supposed to be some kind of a glaze on top.  A little glaze.  Because it's not just the egg white.  It's the flavor.  It's got...  What is it now?  A complete lack of flavor there, Craig? 
[02:43:30]  Yeah, until you hit the raisins.  Oh, so you get a little raisin flavor.  You get a little raisin flavor.  The rest might as well just be like compressed sawdust.  Like a dingleberry.  It could be hidden in there.  That's how you know you're eating bad cake when the whole time you're chewing, you're like,  I cannot wait to get the moisture deliciousness of this raisin.  Raisins are never the highlight of anything.  Anything.  If you're eating dog shit with raisins in it, raisins are the low point.  Wow.  Wow.  A lot of people commenting on the cake.  Eric in New York. 
[02:44:00]  Eric.  Yeah, I believe Katrina would have been destroyed had she put the cake into the Katrina.  Ah, see?  See, it would have soaked up all the moisture there.  It would have saved many people.  We should have sent you to New Orleans.  They could have just walked out of the Superdome on this cake.  All right.  Let's say hi to Candyman.  Candyman can.  What's up?  Good morning, boys.  Hey, there's that kink rack right up there with E-Roc's wings.  With what?  I think it was E-Roc's wings at your party.  E-Roc's wings, I don't think, tasted as bad.  I just think no one was eating them.  It was really funny to see E-Roc's, just his blundered food attempt. 
[02:44:30]  Well, we made believe we ate them, and I was throwing them in the garbage behind his  back to make them feel good, and I got caught.  Oh, poor E-Roc.  I got caught on that one.  You're a worse cook than E-Roc.  That's right.  You're not a worse radio person, but you are a worse cook.  Where is E-Roc?  I'm going to smash him.  Right there.  Where is he?  I'm sorry.  There he is.  I love Eric.  Let's go to Josh and Clintwood.  Josh, what's up?  What's up, guys? 
[02:45:00]  Hey.  The cake thing was the funniest fucking thing I've ever seen.  Of course it was cringy, but it was hilarious.  Of course it was hilarious.  Yeah, the video's still not up on YouTube unless you do a behind-the-scenes search or something.  Uh-huh.  How do you do that again, Sam?  OAVids?  Yeah, you go to OAVideos.  OAVideos.  You search it?  Yeah, one word.  One word.  One word in the search engine?  And then you can click on the username.  You can click on the username.  OAVideos.  OAVideos.  OAVideos.  Oh, my God.  No one's going to find it. 
[02:45:30]  OAVideos username.  It'll be in the normal search in another few hours.  Sean Hannity interviewing Dick Cheney in a sit-down interview with Sean Hannity.  We talk to Sean Hannity.  He talks to the vice president.  That's right.  That's fucked up right there.  It certainly is.  That's one degree of separation.  I like it.  Plus and the president.  That's right.  We have info.  Well, my buddy is in the White House.  He's going to get me a tour.  Oh, my God.  He takes pictures of his friends and the president.  He used to guard Bush's helicopter.  He's my friend.  I want to go with you. 
[02:46:00]  Well, you need two months for security clearance.  Two months to do security clearance for Westwood.  I got security clearance.  I got guns.  You have to be able to have security.  Well, can I bring them?  He actually did say you can.  He said you can, and you can even point them at the president, but it has to be as  a joke.  Oh, shit.  I really want to go on that Westwood.  Two months of security clearance for the Westwood tour.  Really?  This guy's hardcore.  He's a fucking for real Marine.  Marine.  Yeah, he's like a Marine sergeant.  Nice guy, man.  Real gentleman.  It gets funnier every time. 
[02:46:30]  What are you watching in a cake video?  Now stop and you're upsetting people.  I'm sorry.  Brian H. from Virginia.  I have this sneaky suspicion this will not be the last cake Opie receives.  Well, I wish we could have given this to Andrew and then just kicked over his beverage.  Can you make another one of these?  Sure.  Oh, we have to give one to Andrew.  The same way.  Don't go gussying it up and making it a real edible piece of food.  Can we guess what pills you're on?  Save the formula. 
[02:47:00]  Sure, I guess.  I'm not on any pills.  You sure?  Swear to God.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I've just been up all night.  Doing what?  Not baking.  Another big joke.  You've just been maybe tipping a few back last night.  Maybe, yeah.  A little Jack.  A little Jack Daniels?  Yep.  What do you do for a living?  I do lots of things.  Oh, really? 
[02:47:30]  Why do you want to know?  The good stuff, obviously.  If you're a secretary, who cares?  No.  If you're yanking it, you repair dings in the Alamo?  No, huh?  I thought it would be funny.  Hold on.  Wait.  Please hold.  So what do you do for a living?  I bake homes for indigenous people to live in.  There you go.  All right.  Adobes.  Same adobe joke.  Thank you, Jimmy.  Oh, did you do an adobe joke?  I said she repairs dings in the Alamo. 
[02:48:00]  Oh, dude.  I don't know what a ding in the Alamo.  Oh, all right.  Like a dent or a ding.  All right.  Here's what I do.  All right.  Hold on.  And Stan jots down.  Dings out on an Alamo like this.  I heard him, Ralph.  I heard him, Ralph.  You have no sense of humor.  Hey, Matt in Boston, go ahead.  Fix the thing.  The Alamo will get...  I heard him, Ralph.  Hey, Matt, what's up? 
[02:48:30]  Oh, if I get to call you out on something.  Yeah.  You didn't get caught on the thing with the wings.  You told him on the air and made him feel like a dick.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, right.  I left that out of the story.  You're right.  I was bummed I didn't get caught, so I had to bring it to his attention the next day on  the show.  You're right.  Eric, did you notice that people were avoiding your wings like they were AIDS needles?  No.  Hey, I wonder if...  See, I was trying to do the right thing.  Were you?  Hey, that's where it gets all twisty with me because during the Super Bowl, I was doing 
[02:49:00]  the right thing, throwing some wings out so I could go, look, E-Rock, wow, your wings  were a hit.  And then I slept on it and then decided, no, I have to tell him what I did the next day.  This is the conflict that happened to me.  Yeah, you could have just left it alone.  Left it alone and he would have...  He would have thought everyone ate his wings.  He would have been walking a little lighter knowing that people enjoyed his wings.  Contributed.  My wings were a hit.  That is my conflict right there.  I bet he got on the phone as soon as he got home from the party and called whatever girl 
[02:49:30]  he was dating at the time and she went, how was it?  And he probably went, my wings were a hit.  Good.  The wings went over.  They were all gone.  I told you, honey, you could do it.  You're not garbage.  As his wings sat in the garbage.  They certainly did.  That's why the fucking mice were foraging around because what they found was inedible.  The fucking mice wouldn't even eat those wings.  Let's say hi to Ian in Philly.  Ian.  Yeah, what's up, guys? 
[02:50:00]  Hello, Ian.  I just wanted to say that that cake was drier than Kenny's hair.  Comedy pyramid, Fez.  Comedy pyramid.  I would like to see Kenny in the shower, just scrubbing his hair and flesh of this cake  falling out.  Fire department will be cold.  Okay.  I'll use conditioner.  Let's get a mic in Missouri.  They put Vaseline intensive care lotion on the cake.  It disappears.  Wow. 
[02:50:30]  Hey, this is a great cake.  It's called Cinema and Eczema.  Cinnamon, I mean.  Cinnamon, and then he says, Simon, him.  We have a multi-car accident.  Please avoid this area at all costs.  And a dry cake spill all over the highway. 
[02:51:00]  Gentlemen, please rest your sphincters.  That is it.  Oh, no.  That was fun.  It's out Friday-wide cinema.  Can you do the other one?  Back, back, back, back, back, back, back.  Home run?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, forget it.  I love that one.  Mike in Missouri.  Go Cardinals, by the way.  You got a sucky cake.  I'm a black ninja, motherfucker.  Laughing at the sucky cake.  Yeah.  Well, you know, it was nice of it to make it.  It just, we forgot something. 
[02:51:30]  How about some sin, na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na.  Back goes Griffey, looking up.  And it's out of here.  Or is it?  No, it's all for long.  My mistake.  I am.  Your mistake.  Hey, look.  You couldn't get it out fast enough.  I certainly couldn't.  Because I couldn't remember psoriasis.  Which is what I really wanted to call that cake.  Flaky-skinned cake.  Psoriasis.  Oh, shit.  That's a great line, John.  It certainly is.  It really was. 
[02:52:00]  Nick in Virginia, what's up?  Fumbling as it fell out of your mouth.  Oh, I couldn't help it.  Like the cake it did.  There was no moisture to my words.  You spit that joke into 57.  Let's go to Nick in Virginia.  Nick.  I hear that cake is drier than Bill Burr's grandmother's snack.  Oh, wow.  He's reaching way back.  Callback.  That's a good one.  Chandler from Wyoming.  Hey, good morning, gentlemen.  Hey.  Hey, I spend hundreds of dollars a year on tampons for my wife. 
[02:52:30]  I was wondering if that gal could send me some of that super-absorbing cake.  Super-absorbing cake.  That's right.  It's not a bundt cake.  It's a cunt cake.  You're just jamming in there.  I don't know why I had to explain it.  He said tampon.  I said cunt cake.  And then I figured I'd get one more laugh and just fuck everybody got uncomfortable.  Like, all right, we heard.  How much emotional love do you need?  We laughed.  Move on, shit dick.  Jeremy in Jersey. 
[02:53:00]  Morning, boys.  Hey.  Hey, she's a regular Wolfgang suck.  Wolfgang suck.  Sorry.  All right.  You could have lost my internet connection.  All right.  Trying to get on the...  Oh, boy.  It continues.  John in Jersey.  What's up, John?  Hey.  E-Rock should put this cake into his pits.  Oh, wow.  He's saying, Eric, you didn't hear it because you had the thing on, but he was implying 
[02:53:30]  that you're sweaty armpits.  He said, E-Rock should put this cake under his pits.  Because, man, we were making fun of you that time because you're armpits.  I don't remember.  Okay.  I don't know.  I don't know.  It continues.  Oh, the torture.  Always goes back to E-Rock.  I didn't know.  I wasn't trying to, you know, old garbage juice pits.  All right, ladies.  So, your cake's dry.  Yeah, by the way.  Yeah.  Your cake.  It's a bit on the dry side.  Would you be willing to make another cake and bring it? 
[02:54:00]  Yeah.  We'd like to see if you maybe, maybe there's just a fluke.  Maybe she was in a rush.  Yeah.  Sometimes people have been doing things all night and they stand there and they nod  off.  Right.  And they forget.  And that.  And all the water evaporated out of your cake mix.  Yeah.  I forgot vanilla extract.  What's that?  I forgot vanilla extract.  I drank it.  Oh, shit.  I'm kidding.  I'm kidding.  You didn't forget the water extract.  Wow.  I have one gallon of flavor extract coming up. 
[02:54:30]  Right now, somewhere in her kitchen is a pile of deliciousness.  You brought the wrong, the wrong tin.  You forgot step 10.  Fold in deliciousness.  Never heard of folding?  No.  When you're baking, you must fold.  I'm using baking terms.  Where are we going?  Adobe fixing terms.  Hold on a minute. 
[02:55:00]  Where did you learn that from?  Um, I think it was the cooking channel.  Forget Aristotle.  Yeah.  Fuck Socrates.  Here comes Professor Anthony.  In the middle of that song, it's him fucking grabbing a fly from midair with his tongue.  Yeah.  Wow.  You imagine if that was a birthday cake, you put one candle in there, you'd have a fucking  four-alarm fire.  Like asbestos.  Can I put some of that cake in my attic to fucking insulate my home? 
[02:55:30]  It's the R factor on that.  It's an R-16 cake.  It's insulation talk.  You're an insulation talk.  Wow.  I am piling up these vehicles.  How do you know that?  It's like a Dukes of Hazzard episode.  It's a foggy day on the Autobahn in January.  Who knows what R-16 is?  It's the R factor of insulation, which, uh, measures its, uh, ability to, um, retain heat.  And you learned that where?  Um, actually working. 
[02:56:00]  Forget Aristotle.  You fucked Socrates.  Air conditioning and heating for years.  Here comes Professor Anthony.  Jesus Christ.  Okay.  We need more of this cake.  All right.  Well.  I wish we could have given Andrew some of this, just to watch him chew it.  Oh.  Oh, it's delicious.  They make the Lord provide.  Oh, that one.  I think it meant big A.  Oh, no.  Not for what?  It'd be funny, too, to just try to talk with his mouth all dry.  Well, it couldn't be any worse if it's already blocking his colon. 
[02:56:30]  It's quite the same stuff.  John from North Carolina.  Hey, how y'all doing today?  Hey.  All right.  I would tell Obi to take a run and jump on that cake, but I'm afraid he'd turn an ankle.  Turn?  I'd break an ankle.  There he goes.  Jump on a rock.  Yeah.  I'm trying to think of what dries up and then just crumbles.  Oh, dog shit.  You baked Lot's wife.  She cooked it with dry ice, maybe? 
[02:57:00]  Because then it shatters.  Where's that button?  Yeah, right there.  Just a busy day.  Wow.  I was going for knowledge.  Toad trussed her out in force.  Senna eczema.  Senna.  I was going for knowledge, not joke.  Okay.  Dry ice makes things crumble.  No.  Liquid nitrogen.  Liquid nitrogen.  Oh, see.  That's right.  Now you have to because I'm...  That's what happened.  The cop in Terminator 2 ate a piece of her cake.  There you go. 
[02:57:30]  That cake is drier than Than's Delivery.  Oh.  A little inside from somebody on Wackbag.  Somebody knows.  Wet and sticky Jim Simmons said that.  Why don't we take a break, huh?  That's right.  Oh, that's funny.  Cigars and Scotch.  Where are we going?  He's got a good line.  Where is he?  Yeah, yeah.  Why don't you finish up on the cake there, Cigars? 
[02:58:00]  She's a regular Saharali.  Saharali, a dessert.  Come on.  God damn it.  That was a good one.  Saharali joke.  Hysterical.  Thank you, Cigars and Scotch.  That's terrific.  She's a regular Saharali.  Saharali.  Cake is dry.  How dry is it?  Regular Saharali.  Quick, give me a drink.  I want to hit my wife.  Dryer than Ed's liver. 
[02:58:30]  My wife.  What?  She's a giggly mess over there.  Oh, I love her.  I want to marry her.  I mean, Andrea's cake caving your skull.  But it wouldn't, though.  It's like one of those fucking, like, one of those sugar bottles they hit you with.  Yeah.  Holy shit.  See a fucking cake come apart like that. 
[02:59:00]  That's how the goo cooks, man.  Yeah, you know, if you baked a good cake, never even would have talked about it.  It would have been on the street, take a bite.  Jimmy would have went, wow, that's a good cake.  That would have been it.  I'm so glad.  You cooked such a piece of shit.  I know, it's crazy.  We could just roll on it.  I know.  It's crazy.  It's horrible cake.  It's really kind of crazy. 
[02:59:30]  Your gift was an abomination.  All right.  Are we going to take a break?  I think we should.  Yeah, I think so.  Thank you very much for your shit cake.  You're welcome.  Thank you, Andrea.  And, yeah, bake another one.  Bake another cake.  Let's see how you do.  Okay.  Let's see if you go, you know, 0 for 2.  Split it up.  1 for 1.  You know, whatever.  1 for 2.  You may be a good cook now that you're doing something.  What I'm talking about here.  You're saying you may go 0 for 2 and maybe you...  1 and 1.  We'll go for 1 and 1 out of 2, which means maybe whatever you missed this time, you get that. 
[03:00:00]  I was going with it.  Deliciousness.  The big bowl of deliciousness.  There's a bowl in her house right now, which we would fight each other physically to get to.  Sitting out, forgotten.  Right now.  There's people tapping on her window.  They sense it's in there.  This is a fucking...  This is something...  You know what you want to bring with it?  A humidifier.  This cake needs a fucking humidifier. 
[03:00:30]  Oh, my God.  Let's go to Jason in Virginia Beach.  Jason.  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hey.  Hey, that chick's laugh is making me laugh at work.  I got headphones on, and I'm just dying laughing just hearing her laugh.  I know.  I want to drive to Tarantino's house with her and fucking pump a needle into her heart.  Wow.  Nice reference.  Hey, can we tickle you?  Let Jimmy tickle you. 
[03:01:00]  Are you ticklish?  No.  I won't do it hard.  Above the knee is ticklish if you grab and squeeze a little.  Or Jimmy?  Or the ribs are ticklish.  Where are you ticklish?  Step next to Jimmy.  Yeah.  Yeah, she's on...  Yeah, look, look.  Get her really laughing.  No.  She's not ticklish.  I'm not ticklish.  Try the cunt.  No.  I just held her ass there.  No.  She kind of gassed her on me.  What about the underarms?  No?  You're not a good tickler. 
[03:01:30]  No.  Oh, wow.  I never tickle him.  That's a challenge.  Well, you're doing too hard.  Do we have any good ticklers out there?  Oh, no.  Bring in Roland.  Are you doing too hard?  Yeah, you have to catch me off guard.  Oh, yeah, you're right.  What?  Catch her off guard.  Okay.  All right, I want Roland.  What the fuck is that?  Ah!  Oh, she screamed.  I like that.  That's a reaction I'm used to.  Now that I can live with.  Roland, are you a good tickler?  Uh, no.  I'm just hungover right now.  Tired.  Are you really? 
[03:02:00]  Yeah.  I don't want to be tickled.  You want something to sop that alcohol up?  That'll do it.  No.  Why are you hungover, Roland?  No, I went to the Killer's Concert and After Party.  That was last night?  Mm-hmm.  Son of a bitch.  Our hours suck.  They are bad.  Yeah, I went home.  I got home like at 3.30, 4.  Yeah.  Wow.  That is late.  Yeah.  That's when we got up.  Early.  The show was like only like an hour and 20, an hour and a half.  They blew through a lot, but it was really good.  It can only be that long.  They don't have that much material out there, right? 
[03:02:30]  No, yeah.  Two albums?  Two albums, and the show started around like 9 o'clock, 9.20.  Yeah.  And they just ripped through.  What's the drink of choice for you?  Kettle One Soda.  What?  Kettle One Soda.  Oh, Killer One.  Kettle One.  Oh.  Vodka.  What?  What is it?  Kettle One.  Kettle.  Kettle.  You don't like any hard consonants now, do you?  Wow.  He likes everything soft.  What did you just say?  Kettle One. 
[03:03:00]  Kettle.  Kettle.  Kettle.  Kettle.  Kettle.  He doesn't say my name right either.  What's my name?  Jim Norton.  Jim Norton.  Jim Norton.  Jim Norton.  Jim Norton.  You know who his mouth moves like?  You ever watch Davey and Goliath?  Yeah.  Yeah.  The way the claymation's mouth moves.  All right.  Jim Norton.  So what songs do they do?  All their hits, basically.  Bright Side.  When You Were Young.  A lot of stuff off the new album. 
[03:03:30]  The new album's cool.  I like it.  All right, Roland.  What's going on?  Roland?  You all right?  I don't know.  I don't know.  What?  Oh, I don't know.  Don't shake me up like that.  You're really hungover.  Yeah.  Why don't you just go home?  I have to.  He's really dedicated to the show.  I love that.  Yeah, and then I have to do other stuff to get ready for the Halloween show and the shows  for next week.  Yeah.  Okay. 
[03:04:00]  All right.  What do you have to do for the Halloween show?  Just confirming the other guest.  Lynch wants to stop by, so he's working that out in the schedule to do the Halloween song.  Right.  So, different stuff.  All right.  I'm seeing an awful pink smoothie here.  What?  What's wrong with a pink smoothie?  It's a lot of strawberry-y.  No, it's strawberries.  No.  See?  It's too pink.  Too pink?  You want me to fix it for you?  Yeah, you need something to balance out that too strawberry-y flavor. 
[03:04:30]  Yeah, not enough banana in that.  That's a strawberry goddamn.  All right.  Why don't we take a break?  Thank you, lady.  All right.  What's your name again?  Andrea.  Andrea, thank you.  You gave us a great hour.  Andrea.  Thank you.  With your dry cake.  I love you guys, you drink.  Thank you.  Yeah.  All right.  I was filling up a bit.  Yeah?  Were you?  Oh, God.  She sat on my knee.  Quick, stick it in the cake.  Moisten it up.  You know what that cake needs an antihistamine?  Oh, no.  That cake already got an antihistamine.  Yeah, well.  That was all right. 
[03:05:00]  A histamine.  All right, thank you.  Do you want me to take it with me?  You can take your...  Yeah.  You can...  Wow.  She sat on my knee.  I got a...  You're digging it?  Oh, Jesus.  I can't stand up.  I got my sister out there.  Now I know what Phyllis Diller looks like a hundred years ago.  Young version of Phyllis Diller.  Nice, right?  A little bit.  It's a compliment, right?  Yeah.  All right.  I will do you with Mount Wednesday.  Jim Norton will be appearing on The Late Show with David Letterman, Wednesday, November 1st. 
[03:05:30]  Check local listings for showtime.  Some Nirvana, huh?  Segway song.  Who is the homeless guy?  Well, Kurt's in the news today.  Wait, who's our homeless man?  The old black dude.  Uh...  Mac.  Mac.  Right?  Yeah.  I think he's dead. 
[03:06:00]  My nephew just pointed out.  He's 12.  And he pointed out.  He said, that cake reminded me of that guy's leg, and I wish I would have hit that.  That is great.  Exactly what it was.  Really good.  Tina!  Hey, what's up?  Tina Fey calling from the set.  Hi, Tina.  How's it going?  Good.  Very good, Tina.  I got to tell you, I'm a big fan of the show.  Oh, thank you.  I'll tell you why.  Tracy Morgan.  It's hilarious.  Yeah, he did our O&A Traveling Virus this summer, and I'm so glad that Tracy's finally  on TV as himself.  Thank you. 
[03:06:30]  That was my goal.  Was it really?  Yeah, because I was like, I'm not going to sanitize him for anyone's protection.  Yeah, it really seems like when he was on SNL, he was sanitized.  Like, he seemed so normal on SNL, and we were fortunate enough to hang with him this summer,  and in the past, he's been kind of doing our show off and on for years, and we're like,  man, people don't realize that this guy is nuts.  He's hilarious, and he's wildly hilarious.  I mean, he's not literally nuts.  I don't want to be mad.  No, no, no.  I mean that as a compliment. 
[03:07:00]  He's nuts and just hilarious.  He doesn't need a script.  You just turn the camera on and let him go.  Yes, let him go.  We used to hear all kinds of stories from Brewer and stuff and how crazy he was backstage,  and you just didn't see it on the show.  But then, yeah, finally getting a chance to see that part of Tracy.  Yeah, we did a celebrity softball game in Jersey in front of, I don't know, I think like 6,000 or so fans,  and no one cared about the softball.  And Tracy Morgan decided to come in and pitch, walks out on the field in nothing but a jockstrap in front of 6,000 people. 
[03:07:30]  He has, the beauty of Tracy is he always wants to be naked, and he has a horrible body.  He has that Will Ferrell gene that's like, I would like to take my shirt off.  I don't care what's under there.  They love being naked.  Well, I've got to say, 30 Rock, I'm definitely enjoying it.  I DVR it every week.  Oh, God bless you.  How many years do you have SNL?  I was working there for nine years.  Wow.  And I did update for six years. 
[03:08:00]  Now you're gone, right?  Yeah.  Now what, did you want to leave for this project in particular, or are you like, look, I'm done with this phase,  let's hope something comes along?  Yeah, it was both.  It was a nice bridge to be able to go do this and stay in New York and do it,  but it was also, I think either way, it was time, you know.  So, because I always say, it's like being in high school or college, you know, you've got to graduate at some point.  You were behind the scenes for a while.  Yes.  Writer.  Yes.  Head writer.  In a boys club.  Mm-hmm.  How was that?  Fun?  It was really fun.  I think it used to be worse there, because, you know, people always warned me before I went there of like, 
[03:08:30]  oh, it's so hard, and they're so mean, and I had a great time.  You didn't have a problem with like dick jokes and stuff?  No.  I mean, no, I love dick jokes.  I love the dick jokes, because sometimes guys feel a little like they can't really open up  and really be funny because a girl's in the room or something like that.  Yeah, I know, I think it was okay, because all the girls that work there are pretty down.  Like, if you come up, you know, doing improv and stuff, you've heard the filthiest thing ever.  Yeah, yeah. 
[03:09:00]  I guess that would make me immune to it.  That's all right, Jimmy.  Anybody there you didn't get along with?  No, no.  Because so many people, I was already friends with them from Chicago, like Amy Poehler and Rachel Dratch and, you know, Horatio Sands.  I knew all those guys already.  Yeah, Amy Poehler's hilarious.  She's awesome.  Yeah, you guys did a great job on the news, and that's a kind of tough thing to do.  That seems like the toughest gig on SNL is doing the news, because sometimes it just doesn't work, 
[03:09:30]  and it's because of the person they put there.  Right, yeah, you never know what's going to work.  And in some ways, it's also the best gig to have there, though, because it never gets cut.  Yeah, that's true.  You're always on every week.  Everyone else has to sweat it.  And Jimmy, you and Jimmy were really good, so her kind of jumping in there.  Fallon, Jimmy, fallon.  Not Jimmy Norton, you tool.  Me and Jim Norton.  You guys were really good, so her coming in and actually working out was pretty good.  Oh, thanks.  I think that would be the most fun gig, because the acting aspect would intimidate me in front of the live audience. 
[03:10:00]  I mean, I did a couple things with Colin Quinn on that stage for the Colin Quinn show.  Yeah, you could do that.  It's hard, because we went out live on a Monday night, and the fact that you know everybody's watching you,  and you have no leeway, it was really horrifying.  Well, that must be for a stand-up to know, like, oh, I can't just, if I feel this crowd doing one thing,  I can't just change what I'm going to say.  Oh, my God, I've never thought of it that way.  Which is why the news...  Just go with the flow.  Yeah, you can't, you can't.  I never saw anyone on SNL break the wall and say something to the audience. 
[03:10:30]  Can I, I know you guys are in the middle, if that was to happen,  would Lauren get really mad if someone just went off the cue cards?  Well, you know, the only thing that would make it sort of not cool is if you stretched,  if you took a bunch of extra time that then messed up the person after you, you know?  What if you took a lot of time, but you just completely killed?  That you would get away with it.  Oh, okay, yeah, because, I mean, comedy, it's, at times, it's about feeling, you know,  being in the zone, feeling the energy, and going with something.  Yeah, and there were definitely times, you know, I think for me and Jimmy, 
[03:11:00]  especially, like, because Jimmy had the stand-up background, too,  where he would, he would stop sometimes and, you know, address the audience a little bit.  Right, yeah.  I can't remember, there was one time where I actually lost my temper with the audience.  It must have been in a dress rehearsal.  I can't remember what it was.  And it was some, like, joke, and they groaned really hard at it.  Oh.  And I was like, really?  Like, I just missed a little while.  Really?  Did I upset you?  All right, I've got to ask you something else, because I watch Jimmy on stage a lot,  and he gets really pissed when someone groans at some of his material.  What is it, as far as being a comedian, and you hear someone groan over something you're trying to do? 
[03:11:30]  Well, I think it's sort of like, you know what, laugh or don't laugh, but don't groan.  Judge.  That's judging you.  That's what gets to some of the comedians.  Oh.  But you know what it is, Tina, that's their way, because a lot of them know that they  can't just stand up and go, I object, but that's what they want to do, because they're  such boobs, they think they're part of the creative process, and it's like, you're not.  Your job is to, like, laugh or stare.  Those are your options.  You have two.  It's not a dialogue.  The best part of it.  Right, it's not a dialogue.  Tina, the best part of Jimmy, when someone groans in the audience, I go, oh boy, they have 
[03:12:00]  no idea what they just did, and then Jimmy decides to just beat up the entire audience  and give them something to groan over.  Everyone has to pay.  I feel if I'm not going to feel good, we should all need a shower when this is over.  Comics are psychopaths.  But dude, that's the tough part of doing sketch comedy is you can't do that.  You ever do a sketch, I'm sure you have, where you feel like, all right, the sketch  is bombing horribly, and we are trapped in this.  We can't do anything.  Yes.  I mean, mostly I came from an improv background, so at least when you were improvising, 
[03:12:30]  you could kind of, you could change what you were doing.  But yeah, sometimes, the good thing, too, about improv and sketch is you're not alone.  Like, the few times that I ever tried to do stand-up at a really amateurish level, if  it starts to go south, it's just you, and you get so sweaty.  At least when you're doing a sketch, you can look in the other person's eyes like, oh  my God, this is going bad.  You both kind of look at each other and go, we both suck, don't we?  Yeah. 
[03:13:00]  Comrades in suckdom.  Exactly.  Did you, I got to ask you this, when Jimmy Fallon did his cameo in Band of Brothers, did  you just bash him?  Well, I don't think I ever saw it.  Oh, come on.  It was one of, now, Band of Brothers, I loved it.  It was a whole World War II thing and a very good show.  And he had one line, right?  Yeah, he had one line, and he drives up in a Jeep, and I'm so into this show, and I was  completely taken out of it, because he's like, he said something like, hey, you guys need 
[03:13:30]  some ammo?  Yeah.  And he said it like he was sitting at the news desk.  Completely took me out of it.  I wanted to hit him.  I assumed other people might have seen it and goofed on it.  I've seen a lot of our listeners checking in.  Tina Fey, hottest woman in glasses ever.  God bless.  Do you, was that a little weird for you?  You know, you kind of get on TV, and guys start going, hey, this chick's kind of hot.  No, man, I was so, I was so expecting the opposite.  Were you?  I'd be like, get that mug off TV. 
[03:14:00]  So that, um, I'll take it.  I'll take where I can get.  Glasses thing, definitely.  People would like those glasses.  You could put those glasses on a rotting pumpkin.  It was so funny at the beginning when you, like, because you were doing the news, and  then all of a sudden it would be like, oh, look, Tina's in a sketch.  Yeah.  Like, they'd put you, they'd start putting you in sketches.  Well, the only time I would usually ever be in a sketch is if all the other girls were  already in it.  Yeah, you were, like, in the background somewhere.  Right, and you just needed one more girl, and that would be fun, but I never really.  Tina, I've got to ask you something. 
[03:14:30]  We bash female comics on this show all the time.  Yeah.  And I think you're hilarious.  I think Amy Poehler's hilarious.  What is it about the basic female comic that gets under, like, the skin of maybe guys  in general?  I don't know.  I mean, it's hard, too, because when you are female in comedy, there's so much pressure.  Like, if I see some other lady go up in sketch or stand-up or whatever, I'm always like,  oh, please don't suck.  Right.  Please don't suck, because you will take me down with you. 
[03:15:00]  Whereas it's not like that for guys.  If a guy's a comic and then some other comic sucks, no one's going to say, like, you know  what?  There it is.  Dudes can't do it.  Yeah.  Women do have it.  I mean, and I'm being honest.  Women do have it tougher in stand-up for that reason.  It's like you're getting judged with other women.  Yeah.  Right.  And I think maybe the, you know, I think women who have done it have been very sort  of truthful and honest in their comedy.  Like, if you look at, you know, Roseanne or whatever, they kind of break through and  they make it.  It's when you kind of act like how you think people expect you to act or something. 
[03:15:30]  Like, you just...  Most of the time, I just don't even give them a chance.  I'm at Caroline's and, you know, there'll be six, seven comics on the lineup and they  announce the female comic.  I'm like, oh, come on.  I'm just being honest, you know?  Yeah, yeah.  But every once in a while, like, I forgot her name, Jimmy, the one that opened up for  you, the black...  Oh, Marina Franklin.  She's very funny.  She's hilarious.  I mean, there's a lot of good...  I mean, I've seen as many...  Like, the ratio of bad male comics to good comics, there's more bad male comics, just  like there's more bad female comics, but there's fewer women. 
[03:16:00]  So if you see six of them and four of them are bad, you're like, this is awful.  But if you see 50 guys and 30 of them are bad, you're like, well, at least there's  20 good ones.  You know what I mean?  Exactly.  And also, I mean, we could be brutally honest and say probably it's the white female comics  where we're really having the problems.  Yeah.  But yeah.  There's almost any black female comic up there, and she will be funny.  Yeah, they tend to be a little bit more reserved, some of the white women I've watched.  I don't have a problem with female comics, to be honest.  Like, I like Sarah Silverman.  I like the racial stuff she does. 
[03:16:30]  Anybody who's honest on stage, I kind of like it.  See, that's the thing, right?  Because instead of being like, I've been shopping a lot lately.  Like, nobody talks about shopping.  Yeah, shopping.  An overbearing mom.  Yeah.  I'm in another relationship, and oh boy, is this one bad.  Is it?  My clock is ticking.  You know, and how many male comics do you see go up that are just sort of like, it's  just, you know, I don't even know, I don't know how you feel about Dan Cook even, but  like, when you see, like, Mr. Jim Norton, or you see Colin Quinn, you're like, oh no, 
[03:17:00]  that's the real deal.  Yeah.  Oh, thank you.  Like, this is a person who's in this art form to really do this, not just, like, get  a TV show out of it.  Jimmy, Tina Fey just gave you a compliment.  Very nice of her.  Oh, yeah.  The thing with Dane is this, it's like, as a comedian, I mean, I'm selling tickets for  the Hammerstein Ballroom.  I'm hoping I'll sell it out.  He's on his second show at the Garden, so there's a part of me that I do really want  to pump a bullet into him for that.  Right.  But he appeals to, like, Dane's audience is totally different than mine in that, like,  you know how it is.  He's going after college students.  Like, his audience is completely different. 
[03:17:30]  Yeah.  I don't know.  We're just polar opposites.  What Jimmy is trying to say, Dane Cook's audience is very simple.  They're young.  We're just Britney Spears versus, like, Emmylou Harris.  There you go.  I don't know.  My audience...  I've always said that you're the Emmylou Harris of course.  Oh, probably.  I don't know.  I've seen my audience laughing at Mississippi Burning.  I wouldn't call them exactly sophisticated.  They're all just psychopaths.  Yeah.  Hey, do you have an idol, like, a sketch idol?  Because, I mean, I think... 
[03:18:00]  I've always thought Lucille Ball was...  I mean, I'm going with women.  But Lucille Ball I always thought was great.  But I always thought that Carol Burnett was much funnier.  I always thought she was, like, the funniest woman, I think, ever on television.  I love Carol Burnett.  Yeah, I grew up watching that show every week.  I thought that show was great.  You look back at it now and you're like, oh, they're fake laughing.  Yeah.  Wait, who's fake laughing?  I always thought Harvey Korman is, too.  Oh, no kidding.  Yeah, all of them, yeah.  And Lucille Ball was so funny when she would do bits.  Like, the bits were always, like, where she was afraid of Desi.  I was like, this is lame.  But then when it would be some bit like Vitamina Vegemin or, like, you know... 
[03:18:30]  Yeah, where it's just her.  Just a plain bit, she really was good.  You know, of course, I grew up watching Gilda, but also, like, SCTV.  Yeah.  Catherine O'Hara, so funny.  Mm-hmm.  Andrew Martin.  Yeah, the...  I always really loved Jan Hooks on SNL.  That goddamn bit with the Emporium out on the highway.  Oh, Tex and Edna Boyles.  Yeah.  Like an Emporium.  Very cool, man.  Do you know what it seems like I find, too?  Like, if you want to talk about women who perform, the women that perform that are the  best, I think, or the most successful are the ones that aren't afraid to look or to 
[03:19:00]  do things that are just most commonly attributed to men.  Like, to shit on themselves, to be unattractive, just things that are...  Right, look ugly, all that stuff.  Yes.  You look at, like, Amy Poehler is so gorgeous in real life, but she doesn't care when she's  doing...  When she's working.  You know?  She doesn't want to...  She'll dress up like whatever.  Right, like Carol Burnett would always...  She never minded looking just like a retard.  She never minded like guys don't.  I think that's...  If you have that sensibility as a performer, I think that's what you need, pretty much, 
[03:19:30]  to be considered funny across the board.  Yeah, that's right, true.  Well, Tina's on set, so...  Oh, Jesus.  Tina, the big plug for 30 Rock.  Maybe some people out there don't know what the show's about.  Yeah.  30 Rock is a show based on kind of my experiences.  I play the head writer of a comedy show, a late night show, and Alec Baldwin plays my corporate  boss from GE.  Who's great, by the way.  You guys got some good chemistry there.  Oh, thank you.  Well, that guy's a genius.  And he comes in and he messes up my life by insisting that I put this crazy ex-movie  star, played by Tracy Morgan, on the show. 
[03:20:00]  Yeah.  Based on Martin Lawrence, but Tracy doesn't want to say it, and no one else is associated with  30 Rock.  But, you know, one of the first scenes, they show Tracy running down the street in just  his underwear in L.A.  The good thing is so many black dudes have gone crazy from everywhere.  You can't really zero in on any one.  And it's on Wednesday nights at 8 o'clock on NBC, and I've heard a lot of really good  stuff about it.  I've not seen it, but...  I haven't missed one yet.  Everyone has said it's a great show.  I think there's only been, what, two or three, though, right?  There's only been two so far. 
[03:20:30]  Yeah, two.  All right.  Well, there you go.  Wow.  It's not like one.  It can't be in any time.  Yeah.  Oh, it's like I haven't missed one yet.  There's been two.  There's been two.  All right.  Well, good luck with it, Tina.  I think I've seen it more than once, then.  And 8 o'clock, Wednesday nights on NBC, it's...  Where'd she go?  She pulled the gag on you.  Oh, wow.  I thought we were having a good time.  I was expecting a phone call, then.  We were going to get, like, right in the middle of the plug.  Wow.  Click.  Can someone tell Tina that we didn't hang up on her?  Unless I was a publicist, like, who might have thought we were done.  But can someone tell her that we didn't hang up on her? 
[03:21:00]  Click.  So you could catch it.  I clicked.  There are times you feel like you're really getting along with your guests.  You're clicking.  And you're fast-forward to the phone calls and the lunches you're going to have together.  Possibly a guest spot on the show.  You don't think I'm thinking guest spot?  Hey, Tina, great job.  Thanks, shit, Dick.  Click.  Click.  Wow.  You could catch the show on Click Click.  I guess that's what she should have done.  She was done with us.  Hey, where's Roland?  I've got to find out who...  That would be hilarious if she did the hanging up, by the way.  But at 8 o'clock on NBC... 
[03:21:30]  Who hung up?  I don't know.  I think she probably did.  Oh, my God.  I didn't find out, though.  Oh, that's very funny.  Oh, that is great.  Right about now, she doesn't even remember talking to us.  No, why should she?  She's on an NBC show.  So, yes, for her, Tracy Morgan.  Oh, that's great.  That's very funny.  Yeah.  Well, there goes my bonding moment.  I'm like, ah, Tina Fey likes me.  That's a nice plug.  She's got quite the writing chops and performing chops.  Out of her head.  Right now, she's busy doing something for the show.  The whole time, she thought you meant Fallon when you were saying Jimmy and this and that. 
[03:22:00]  And then someone's writing, no, there's a Norton in studio.  And she's like, oh, yeah, Norton.  Oh, Norton.  Yeah, right.  She hung up on us.  That's really funny.  I'm going to bomb on this audition.  I'm so not ready.  Oh, no.  Did you get your other lines?  No, I won't get them.  My managers don't come in.  How do you, how can you go into an audition?  I'm not, I'm not, I don't want to rub this in.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, I, I, I, I, I, Nick.  Nick.  What's up?  What, Nick?  Go ahead.  Say your piece.  Hey, um, I didn't, I didn't like how you were, I kind of labeled like, uh, Dan Cook was a sellout. 
[03:22:30]  And I've seen Dan Cook live.  Oh, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude.  Who said Dan was a sellout?  I said you were kind of labeling him as a sellout.  No, I didn't.  Not even a little bit.  Why do you say?  That's what it sounded like.  Well, well, then you don't listen very well.  He said that his audience was simple.  But I said, oh, I was joking.  He was joking because I said that Dan's audience is much different than my audience.  She was talking about his success.  And I was saying, of course, I'm jealous because he's fucking got a show and a half sold or two shows sold at the Garden. 
[03:23:00]  And he's appealing to a different audience than his audience is much younger than mine.  Well, how is that saying he's a sellout?  How'd you pick that up as a, I don't know.  I thought that it was as the conversation was going on that you kind of were labeling him as a sellout.  Yeah, well, you're wrong.  And when Ope said he was simple, we were joking about my audience.  And I said they laughed at Mississippi Burning.  Right.  So I'm not sure what you do, fucking Danny Defensive.  But relax and listen a little bit better.  Nick, Dane's been on our show many times.  I think I saw the HBO thing, by the way, and it was terrific.  The true sellout is Bob Kelly. 
[03:23:30]  Right.  Bob Kelly has basically turned into a fat waiter with 25 minutes.  He fetches.  All right, Nick.  Get a hold of yourself.  All right, thank you.  Go on, calm down.  Godspeed, Nick.  Just doing jokes.  Did you just get out of the joint?  Really?  He's upset.  That's my first line in my script.  Oh, wow.  Wow, I didn't even know.  I thought you were just talking.  Yeah.  You were acting.  Now, how do you go into a place and have to explain that you don't have the entire script?  Is that the best acting you ever have to do in a reading? 
[03:24:00]  Oh, no, I just tell them.  I just tell them.  I mean, sometimes that can't work for your advantage because they don't expect you to.  But what happens was I had these sides sent to me.  It was supposed to be yesterday's audition.  I said, give me one more day with it.  Sides, people.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Are, well, why don't you tell people, because it's the part of the script that Jimmy is going  to be involved in.  And I have like four pages.  And mine are the highlighted.  Where's on Paltalk?  Yes.  We'll show the Paltalk.  Mine are the highlighted.  The yellow highlighted stuff is mine.  There's a lot on that page, which I'm completely unprepared for. 
[03:24:30]  And I'm not off book, as they say, which means I'll need to hold a paper.  Ah, oh, oh.  So you'll hold the paper and actually read, but you've got to come across like you're  doing the actual character.  And Anna, my manager's assistant, said, well, there's one page of a new side or one new  scene that you have to have.  So I said, send it to me.  It's an Adobe PDF file.  So it won't open.  Once in a while, they're corrupted when they send them to you because they said with the  fucking Mac and I have a PC.  So it wouldn't open.  So I emailed.  I'm like, Anna, it didn't open.  Resend it.  So apparently she just resends the same document. 
[03:25:00]  Uh, because what happens when something is corrupted, if you resend it, it becomes uncorrupted.  No, it's the same corrupted.  Nope.  So I open it again and it's not good again.  So I call her at 6, uh, 913.  That's 613 their time.  And she had already left the office.  So I'm fucked because they won't be in my 1230 audition.  They don't get in until 10.  Now you gotta go, I don't have the rest of it.  Yeah, I don't have the rest of this.  What is it?  You tell me what he does and I'll just do it.  Huh?  What's the character like?  His name is Jimmy. 
[03:25:30]  Yeah.  And he's, uh, the guy who's been in jail.  It's kind of like a comedy and he's, uh...  Gets fucked in the ass?  No, that'd be hot.  Okay.  Um, and he's just talking to these guys.  He wants to join their break-in crew.  Ah.  So the cop says, you tell me this is your car.  He says, yeah, officer.  He says it.  Oh, look, you're moving your hands.  Yeah, I certainly am.  But not, but I'm supposed to play someone who's been paralyzed in a motorcycle life.  Oh, God.  Yeah.  Well, then that's...  Thanks. 
[03:26:00]  All right, why don't we step aside, take another break here.  We'll continue.  The Opie and Anthony Show presents a Wild Bill Production.  Hi, I'm Steve C., the beating heart of the Opie and Anthony Show.  Obviously, my voice is good for more than convincing children that I'm good friends with their parents.  I also volunteer my services as a part-time hostage negotiator.  Steve, it's an emergency, and you're the only one who can bring these hostages back alive.  Why me? 
[03:26:30]  What's the catch?  You might be responsible for the kidnapping.  You mean, it can't be.  You'll never catch me alive, coppers.  I am the unstoppable crime burglar.  I will blow away everyone in this room.  Dr. Crime Burglar, this is Steve C.  Let those children go.  Please, don't rape them.  He never said anything about rape.  I don't trust you, Steve C., you never sent me my wow sticker.  Well, you must not have sent a self-addressed stamped envelope to 111 West 57th Street, New York, New York, 10019. 
[03:27:00]  It was your own fault.  Now let the kids out alive.  I did all that.  Well, were you one of those assholes that just sent an empty envelope with no self-addressed stamped envelope inside?  Sir, we have a clean shot.  Should we take it?  Yeah.  Shoot that bastard in the face.  You're safe now, kids.  Let's go home.  Everyone, get in the van. 
[03:27:30]  But, Mr. Steve, where's our parents?  They're all dead.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Please.  All right.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  How cool.  Very cool.  We got a lot to do today still. 
[03:28:00]  Where were we?  We were going to do something.  Oh, the Kurt Cobain.  From one of those discs.  Those shiny disc-like things in front of you that are so futuristic if you think back just a few years.  How the hell is he making so much more money than Elvis?  I can't believe that.  Well, they do the list every year, the top earning dead celebrities.  You're kidding.  And it's always Elvis, ever since Elvis died. 
[03:28:30]  And for the first time, it's not Elvis.  Do you think perhaps...  It's one of my heroes.  Kurt Cobain, number one on the list.  I think perhaps it's a lot of the Elvis fans getting a little older, dropping dead themselves,  not buying up the Elvis stuff as much as they used to.  They probably have every trinket you could possibly buy.  Exactly.  And then the new generation growing up doesn't have that connection with Elvis, so they don't really care.  I'm a huge Nirvana fan.  I'm wondering how he made so much money.  Like, what do they have out this past year? 
[03:29:00]  I don't know.  Don't know.  Yeah, you wonder, where did all that money come from?  Like a box set?  Albums?  I don't know.  There's still people going out and buying Nevermind?  The king is dead, but now he's not the king anymore.  Elvis Presley has slipped to number two in the Forbes.com website listing of the highest-earning  dead celebrities.  His $42 million earned this year fell behind Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain, who managed to  rake in $50 million this year.  Who knew? 
[03:29:30]  Wow.  I didn't even know there was a dead celebrities list, and I didn't know they were making tens  of millions of dollars.  I knew that Elvis was, but Kurt Cobain, that's pretty surprising.  Just, I mean, it's great.  It's great for his family.  All right.  Thanks, Jeff.  I wouldn't mind her shit in my mouth.  Oh, we're back.  Oh, we're back.  She's a newswoman, and she doesn't know they do this list every year.  I've been hearing about this list since I was like 10.  I didn't know they did this list.  I am surprised that Cobain, wow, $50 million, man. 
[03:30:00]  Einstein's on the list.  Top five.  Fucking Einstein.  Do we have a whole list?  What do they say?  When I saw that on the list, I'm like, now how the hell is Albert Einstein on the list  with, you know, he's top five.  Some type of patenting, I bet.  That's what everyone thought.  That's what everyone thought.  But it's like, oh, it has to be some kind of, because he's a genius.  Back in the, you know, the 20s, 30s, 40s, this guy must have patented things and made  the fortune.  His image?  His image being used in posters and commercials and stuff? 
[03:30:30]  You know something, though?  Is his image really being used that much where he's number five on the fucking list?  This is something that is making the Albert Einstein, the Einstein name, huge in this  day and age.  Oh, my God.  He wrote, happy birthday to me!  Well, he absolutely didn't, you idiot.  You want the top ten, and then when we get to Albert, you can tell him what it is?  Sure.  Let him, give him time to think about it.  Number one.  I know number one. 
[03:31:00]  Oh.  Ten is Johnny Cash.  Okay.  Top earning dead celebrities.  Then it's Marilyn Monroe.  Then Rachel.  Marilyn Monroe.  In ninth place.  What, what, what?  Oh, gay people.  Yeah.  That's all gay money right there.  Marilyn?  Yeah.  Gay guys love that.  I thought it was Judy Garland.  Or Jude, too.  Is Judy Garland on the list?  Then you really see those homo bucks going out there.  Kurt was number one because Courtney Love sold 25% of the rights to his songs. 
[03:31:30]  Topper.  Reno, what's up?  Hey, guys.  How you doing today?  Good.  I read a thing on AOL yesterday.  They said that one of the reasons Cobain's name is up there is because Courtney Love sold  a quarter of his catalog to somebody.  Well, I won't be just said that.  So it's possible that he probably won't be up there next year unless she, you know,  sells another quarter because I get heroin going up in price.  What camp are you in? 
[03:32:00]  Do you think Courtney killed Kurt or had something?  No, I'm not a big Courtney fan.  I'm not a big Courtney or Kurt fan.  I think music took a real dive open.  I know that you're, you know, you're a big Kurt fan, but I don't get it.  All right.  Thank you, Topper.  Oh, you don't get the Nirvana thing?  I don't get the whole Nirvana thing at all.  What's your band?  It just, dude, it just makes me want to go out and kill puppies.  What's your band?  Southern Rock?  No, no. 
[03:32:30]  I mean, you know, a lot of blues, you know, Zeppelin, those guys, Beatles.  How old are you?  42.  Nice.  How old are you?  My son's 12.  He's a huge Beatles fan.  The Beatles?  You know.  The Beatles are amazing.  With the...  Yeah.  Timeless.  My kid listens to some really cool music, you know, I mean, for being 12.  They are timeless.  It's amazing how, like, college students, the Beatles are still really cool to listen to 
[03:33:00]  in colleges.  Right.  They transcend time better than anybody.  Although racially, I'll say the best crossover is Bob Marley.  I don't think anybody racially crosses over to anywhere as well as Bob Marley does.  Oh, no.  I agree.  Hendrix.  Yeah.  No way.  Black people are not riding around right now at their own parties playing Jimi Hendrix.  People respect Hendrix, but you're not going to catch any guys in, like, young black guys.  If you play Bob Marley at a party, nobody will go this sucks.  Black guys don't like Hendrix as much as white guys do.  That is really interesting, Jimmy.  Yeah, I think he translates racially.  What are the bands out there that both races love? 
[03:33:30]  Or even, like, you know, Spanish, Latin.  I mean, like, yeah, I guess black and white, the big ones.  Well, yeah, well, that's the big two, you know.  Yeah.  Let's be honest.  That's the one that's going to be a problem in the future.  Eminem is actually...  That's what the war is going to be all about.  Let's stick right there, black and white.  Eminem, a lot of other rappers, 50 Cent, like, those guys cross over really well, but not  like Marley age-wise, because Bob Marley has people that are 45 and 50 listening to him.  You can go to, like, a cornball dance, and they'll throw on Jammin', and you can hear  that same thing, you know, at a fucking Crips party. 
[03:34:00]  They would play a Marley song because of, you know, and it would be acceptable.  Man, I want to think of other artists that do the same thing.  My daughter, when my daughter was younger, she was a huge blues fan.  Yeah.  She was nine, had a poster of B.B. King over her bed.  Oh, right on.  War, his song fucking War?  It's not by Bob Marley.  It's by, I think, I want to say, Raz Tafari, who was a speech he gave, and fucking Marley  just put lyrics, put songs, put music to it, and just kind of did his speech.  It's fucking great.  How do you not get all vamped up? 
[03:34:30]  How do you not get all riled up?  All right, Topper.  Makes me want to do dope.  Godspeed, Topper.  Be safe.  Hey, you guys have a good morning.  Pat from Monaki wants to guess at the Einstein making money thing.  All right.  He, I guess he's assuming that he gets money whenever someone does something stupid and  then someone else goes, nice work, Einstein.  I love Pat.  He's the greatest.  Very funny, Pat.  We're going to broadcast Last Past Standing.  Standing. 
[03:35:00]  Last Past Standing.  in the near future, in another couple of weeks.  Did Pat go on?  Yeah, he was disappointing, though, man.  He didn't have much prepared.  He was up there for like 30 seconds, if that.  Of course he was disappointing.  Have you seen his foot or his life?  My brother MC, all the videos are up on YouTube, but we're going to do the whole broadcast on  our channel.  Unedited.  Just let it roll.  Let it roll for an hour and a half.  We should have it scheduled soon, so stay tuned.  How was no filter, Paul?  He didn't go up either.  Why?  All talk, no action. 
[03:35:30]  You know, he's always boisterous, but now it comes to Last Past Standing, you would assume  he would go up there and do something.  It's a loud mouth you'd think he'd get up there.  And my brother opened it up to the floor.  Anyone could come up.  So.  All right.  Top earning dead celebrities.  Marilyn Monroe, nine.  Like we said, Ray Charles, eight.  Seventh place, Dr. Seuss.  Dr. Seuss.  Still making a lot of money.  Yeah.  Number six, Andy Warhol.  Okay.  Andy Warhol.  Still making money?  Yeah. 
[03:36:00]  How?  Paintings, man, being sold.  They'd probably sell for a bloody fortune.  I bet he has art books out on his art and shit like that.  Yeah.  Okay.  All right.  Number five is Albert Einstein.  Albert Einstein.  Wait.  Albert Einstein.  We got a guy in the line that's got it.  Yeah.  Do you want to say it or do you want the guy to do it?  No, let the guy say it.  All right.  Let the guy do it.  Paul on Long Island.  Paul.  I'm taking a guess.  It's that baby Einstein bullshit.  Yes.  That I watched for fucking three years of my life.  That's it.  Fucking baby Einstein.  Where did I go? 
[03:36:30]  These videos, DVDs that you plop your kid down in front of the TV.  You plug these things in and it's called baby Einstein.  No, it's great.  Made in some lady's garage.  Yeah.  No, it's great.  Every parent thinks they're the only ones that have found the baby Einstein.  I'm making my kid smarter while he sleeps.  Is that the one that's just like, ball.  I don't know.  Ball.  I really don't know.  Ball.  And they give.  Car.  Car. 
[03:37:00]  Car.  And they'll have like a little car and it just drives you batshit listening to it.  They probably have to pay residuals or obviously a licensing fee to the Einstein stage.  Why not just call it baby smart Jew?  Why not save yourself money?  Smart Jew.  There's a Jew joke.  Unfortunately, we did it over here because we know that chick from earlier.  Yeah, we showed them Jews calling them smart.  That's right.  We certainly smashed them.  She's right.  Baby smart Jew.  She doesn't have the X-Men. 
[03:37:30]  I'm not even a little bit racist, but I'll tell you one thing.  He was one bright hebe.  I don't know how to say that.  He was.  Egg.  All right.  Let's see.  Number four.  Mr. Lennon.  John, if you will.  Number three is Mr. Schultz.  Charles.  Charles Schultz.  Yep.  Those fucking awful cartoons.  Not a big fan.  I recognize that they're fun to read, but if you ever laughed.  Yeah, he's laying in the doghouse again.  Bah. 
[03:38:00]  That fucking dumb bird.  Fuck it.  Woodstock, man.  Yeah, it was Woodstock.  Woodstock's a douche.  What was wrong with Woodstock?  I want to fuck Peppermint Patty in the mouth.  How do you like them apples?  That's right.  Fucking with her mullet and her fucking same-sex marriage agenda.  Peppermint Patty eats the ass of other women.  Charlie Brown is good like when you're a kid.  Mm-hmm.  You know, you read it.  Oh, it's Charlie Brown.  I watched the little holiday specials. 
[03:38:30]  Fucking chemo skull.  I think he had a crew cut.  No, he didn't.  He was fucking bald.  Yeah, he had two hairs.  He had curly hairs in the front.  Two little curly, like pigtails.  His fucking head was like a pig's asshole.  Fucking loose.  You always move in the football.  That scumbag would try to kick it.  Cunt.  One time he would have drove his foot right into her pussy.  She never would have done that again.  Why am I talking like this?  Yeah, what's wrong?  I don't know.  I apologize. 
[03:39:00]  It's part of your childhood.  I'm talking about fucking one of them in the mouth and kick the other one in the pussy.  I'm a woman hater and a cartoon hater.  The Halloween special was wonderful.  Come home, Snoop.  Become home.  Come home.  The last time she pulled the ball away when Charlie finally had enough.  Goddamn rich cunts.  I kill rich cunts.  And she's a rich cunt.  Charlie Brown was the...  Wow.  Then he fucking walked around and made Snoopy smell his shoe. 
[03:39:30]  That's why Snoopy was laying on the doghouse.  He was nauseous.  The runner-up, top-earning, dead celebrity, Elvis Presley.  And then, of course, we told you, Kurt Cobain is number one this year.  They're suggesting to go at the same time frame as baby Einstein to get a baby Hitler.  Well, we got another one, too, from baby Hitler.  Mike from Yonkers.  Mike?  Yeah, what's up, guys?  Yeah, I was wondering if the Yates babies made the list with their new line of swimmies. 
[03:40:00]  No.  No.  No?  No.  Oh, man.  He's like, nah.  Help me out, guys.  Nah.  All right.  I'm done.  All right.  Thank you, man.  People are saying that I actually listened to the real baby Einstein as a child.  We went to the same daycare center.  Bastard.  You're an older man.  It's not funny.  I am not.  We really don't know how old he is.  All right.  This paper does. 
[03:40:30]  Whip him out Wednesday.  Imus talks about wow and t-shirts.  Yes.  He loves talking about the Opie and Anthony show on his own radio show.  Ah.  He was wearing a wow Opie and Anthony shirt today.  What do you say about Mark Chernoff?  He sent me a mousy little email.  Yeah.  He has always made me fucking laugh.  Imus is funny, man.  Always.  I like him.  And I feel like, why do you like him?  And you never listen to Howard.  I never listened to Howard growing up.  I just didn't.  Imus.  My dad was in a car.  I listened to Imus. 
[03:41:00]  It's the fucking language.  It's the way he speaks.  It makes me laugh.  Yeah.  Fuck it.  A mousy little email.  He's perfectly descriptive.  Yeah.  The Imus.  The Imus from earlier.  At any rate.  And I was talking.  You know, I've been whining about.  Everything.  Opie and Anthony.  Well, because I like them.  I mean.  So.  And I have my Opie and Anthony Whip It Out Wednesday t-shirt on today, which is the  only one I like because it's brown with the yellow letters. 
[03:41:30]  It's just a great looking t-shirt.  And it matches your underwear.  Don't take your shirt up.  That was a good line by McCord.  Whip It Out Wednesday.  He said it's brown with yellow letters and McCord said it matches your underwear.  That was a goddamn good line.  It would be line of the day.  Oh, my God.  How did that get fucking.  Oh, no.  Line of the day could be from another radio show today.  That's hysterical.  How did that get plowed over?  Listen.  The yellow letters is such a great looking t-shirt. 
[03:42:00]  And it matches your underwear.  Don't take your shirt up, Brian.  What?  Whip It Out Wednesday.  Well, I'm sure it is.  Which is the pose of the rules.  No, no.  But we don't want you to whip anything out.  Whip it in.  Whip it in.  Jeez.  He was showing his breastesses?  Yeah.  But so then I've been bitching about they won't send me another t-shirt.  They work for us at CBS Radio.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  But then I got to thinking about it.  Why?  I don't need another t-shirt. 
[03:42:30]  Why?  Well, because.  How many can you wear at once?  Or what?  It's like the mouse t-shirts I have.  I must have 50 of them.  Yeah.  But whenever.  Because I thought I needed them.  Why would you need 50 Mickey Mouse t-shirts?  I didn't.  I mean, I asked Willow Bay for them.  And I know.  But I mean, why would you wear that?  Well, that's what they said.  That's what I have.  Oh, okay.  But people think you're wearing the same shirt every time.  I mean, so.  So I can make do with this one t-shirt.  I'd just like to have a backup, you know? 
[03:43:00]  Enough about the t-shirts.  All right.  Here's what I'm going to do.  Wow.  What are you going to do?  I'm sending Imus a framed picture of myself for his desk.  You are an ass.  I'm sending him a framed picture.  But the ones I took in my Calvin Klein underwear, my stomach stick, I'm going to frame that  and send it to him.  He will laugh.  You got to sign it, too.  His fucking ass off opening that up.  Yeah.  Of course I'm going to sign it.  I, man.  Best wishes.  Best wishes. 
[03:43:30]  I'm going to autograph it for Imus.  Oh, he would laugh his ass off.  I don't know.  That's a good picture.  Yeah, but it's going to be, it's going to have a desk frame.  Yeah.  So he can put it up on his desk around with the other letters.  Like your underwear.  What a stupid record trip, though.  I'd like your, uh, like your, uh, like your, uh, hara hara hara.  That was a damn funny line, though.  Very funny.  You can get your Wow t-shirts by going to myradiostore.com.  My brother also has a Fatty Pig Fatty shirt he made.  And a, uh, and the Halloween shirt's really, really cool.  It's a skeleton wowing. 
[03:44:00]  Very, very cool stuff at myradiostore.com.  Yeah.  You guys are heading to, uh, Colorado, right?  Chad in Denver, what's up?  Hey, boys.  Hey.  Hey, I'm just another one of those degenerates that are going to see a little Jimmy Norton  Thursday, Friday, and Saturday at Denver Comedy Works.  Oh, thank you, buddy.  Bring a coat, boys.  It's a little chilly out here.  They say it's a bit nippy.  I hear blizzard.  You hearing blizzard?  Yeah.  What?  You're going to be a little nipply, boy.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Blizzard when?  I'm hearing blizzard. 
[03:44:30]  I'm not kidding.  When?  Thursday afternoon.  When?  Thursday afternoon.  I don't care about Thursday.  How's Sunday?  Sunday's supposed to be like 60 and sunny.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  I fly home Sunday.  But we fly in.  I don't care about getting in.  Thursday afternoon.  Oh, you think?  You don't give a fuck.  You think maybe you can land in a blizzard?  I don't care if we do or don't.  Sunday, I come home because Paul Stanley is in studio Monday.  Punch it out, boys.  Oh, Paul Stanley.  Wow. 
[03:45:00]  All right.  I hear blizzard, though.  I'm hearing things.  Well, if we're a day late getting in, there's nothing we can do.  I mean, we can only do...  I'm going to look.  I hope there's a fucking blizzard that closed the airport that day so I can go meet Peter  Chris.  He's doing a signing.  I don't trust anybody.  I don't trust him, caller.  You're doing your own weather thing?  I am.  Atta boy, Anthony.  Atta boy.  That's what I do.  Of course it is.  I don't take anyone's word for it.  You certainly don't.  Interesting.  Denver.  I have to burp.  Comma C-O.  I'm going to burp through my almond filter so it doesn't sound bad.  There we go. 
[03:45:30]  Let's see.  Wednesday, cloudy in Denver, Colorado.  Thursday, rain, 44 degrees Fahrenheit.  44 degrees Fahrenheit.  Yes?  Not in the mountains.  It's for Denver, Colorado.  Yeah, where do you think we're landing?  Where the fuck?  Where we landed in fucking Moscow? 
[03:46:00]  Hey, how's Sunday?  Sunday, sunny, 63.  I believe I said Sunday.  Well, I got a different weather for you.  What do you have?  Tonight, meaning what?  Wednesday?  Thursday night.  All right, Thursday night.  No, I'm sorry.  This is Thursday.  Yeah, so that's tonight.  Wednesday.  Yes.  Meaning tonight.  Yes, sir.  Okay.  Chance of rain and snow in the early evening becoming widespread snow with areas of blowing  snow from late evening through the night.  Cloudy 61, I have.  Monday, possibly snow, possible snow accumulations of four to ten inches.  Where did you see that?  What site?  With the highest amounts. 
[03:46:30]  It's on Bob Kelly's website.  Near the foothills.  Near the foothills.  We don't deal with the foothills.  We avoid them.  What site?  Ogrish.com.  Ogrish.  That's right.  Weather from Ogrish.  The weatherman.  Blood from clouds.  The weatherman is holding the head of the anchorman.  Jesus.  It's weatherunderground.com.  That weather site sucks ass.  It's fucking dog shit.  It's wunderground.com.  It stinks.  You know how they know if it's going to be cold?  They put a dog dick out the window and they kiss it and they guess the temperature. 
[03:47:00]  I hate that site.  It stinks.  I'm looking at this one.  All right.  What's your site?  I'll take this.  I shop around for my weather until I find the best forecast.  Absolutely.  And CNN has the best.  Right now, it's saying Thursday, 44 degrees.  It's going down to 26 at night, but I don't care about at night.  Who gives a fuck?  Night is for faggots.  I'm flying in.  We're landing.  And then it's going to be nice the rest of the time we're there, Jimmy.  I can't wait.  We'll go.  Me, you, your girl, and my girl.  Oh. 
[03:47:30]  Except your girl is.  Yeah, my girl is 6'6 with dry hair.  And an almost mustache.  Oh, it's fucking awful.  Either shave it or grow it.  Exactly.  Got to bring Andrea's cake to throw on the sidewalks  when we walk around the icy Denver area.  It's horrible.  Oh.  Fucking rock salt with raisins in it.  Ooh, do I want to fuck her.  I want to fuck her so she can cook.  I want to put on a Chef Boyardee hat and teabagger. 
[03:48:00]  Wow.  Bill, come on.  From Philly.  You guys obviously brought nothing to the XM show today.  Talking about the weather.  Come on, guys.  Oh, Bill.  He's probably joking.  Oh, my goodness.  We did a whole hour on a dry cake.  He's probably joking.  All right.  Hopefully.  I certainly hope you're joking.  I just stick up for you, Bill.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Sponsored by Bodogfight.com.  Log on and watch American fighters battle for the right to represent the U.S. 
[03:48:30]  in a bout against the Russians.  It's all on Bodogfight.com.  A mixed martial arts tournament and documentary reality unlike any seen before.  Here is today's runner-up.  Oh, line of the day.  Oh, boy.  It's Danny Fix It.  Ah, that is funny.  Wow.  Wow.  That's right.  Dan said Danny Fix It.  It won as he said it.  Dan wins runner-up line of the day.  Congratulations, Dan.  That's also the most common line of the show. 
[03:49:00]  Well, what happened?  What happened?  What?  That's fine.  What are we doing?  He's saying, Travis, Dan's saying, I can't spell and I wear open-toed shoes.  Does that imply homosexuality?  It was only no.  Wow.  You can read his lips that good from here?  I certainly could.  That's impressive.  Runner-up line of the day.  I don't know.  It's just odd.  They leave things out.  They twist things around.  Well, the next one is for Ron Kind.  His name's Kind. 
[03:49:30]  And they say he's the...  Oh, wow.  This must be a pleasant ad.  And they say he's the wrong kind.  Ah.  What's this one about, Danny?  Well, this is good.  And in the ad, what they do is they have a little W and a big R-O-N and then a little G so you can see Ron.  In the middle of Ron?  In wrong.  Ew.  Oh, because you can't spell wrong without old Ron.  There you go.  I got you.  Good thing his name is not Skunts.  Yes, that was very funny.  Very risque for the FM airwaves. 
[03:50:00]  Yeah, they didn't dump that.  That was good.  They didn't dump...  That was the runner-up line of the day?  Yes.  The line of the day must just be over-the-top funny then.  Let's find out.  Here is today's line of the day.  Here comes the light of the day, light of the day, light of the day, light of the day.  You didn't forget the water extract. 
[03:50:30]  Wow.  I have one gallon of flavor extract coming up.  Right now, somewhere in her kitchen is a pile of deliciousness.  I don't know if that was a line of the day, though.  I'm not even being mock humble.  Very funny, though.  That was a good line, but I don't know if it...  I appreciate the honor, but I don't know.  I think we had a lot of singles today.  Singles, couple of doubles. 
[03:51:00]  You didn't have that monster home run.  You didn't have that one monster home run, but consistent...  Skunts was up there, though.  Come on.  I think Skunts is a better line than that.  They were both very funny lines.  Yeah.  I don't want to put down the lines, but, you know.  If you're looking for one out of the ballpark, maybe we didn't hit one of those.  Nah, maybe Skunts was a double off the wall.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay.  You know what Skunts was?  Skunts was a long single that bounced into the outfield, so I took second on the technicality.  Really fast.  Just a tiny, teeny, tiny little article in the paper today.  Oh, wait a minute, sweetie.  More about... 
[03:51:30]  Well, political correctness has now made it to DVDs.  That's good.  We'll leave you guys with this today.  Okay.  DVDs to pan-smoking.  Film producers Bob and Harvey Weinstein will put anti-smoking video messages on DVDs of movies in which people smoke.  Harvey Weinstein, I sat at the Seinfeld premiere with him.  I've never seen a fucking human pump out more carcinogens.  Really?  In a...  We were the reason I knew who Harvey Weinstein was.  I went to the premiere of Comedian.  And, um, at the restaurant, Seinfeld doesn't smoke. 
[03:52:00]  There's some big fat guy fucking puffing away in a New York restaurant at a Seinfeld premiere, and he didn't give a fuck.  And then someone's like, well, that's Harvey Weinstein.  Ah-ha.  Ah-ha.  No wonder.  He doesn't care.  He wasn't worried about offending anybody.  Now it's going to be a warning on movies.  DVDs, yeah.  A move sought by U.S. states to combat teen smoking.  These messages will fight false film images of healthy and hip smokers with the real hard truth of addiction and disease. 
[03:52:30]  They don't do that with fucking murder.  They don't do it with guns or in rape videos.  Yeah.  Holy shit.  That's why we want to mention it today.  It's to protect the children from smoking.  Fuck them.  While they're smoking, fuck them.  And I mean that literally.  Fuck them with a cigarette in their mouth.  Teach them two lessons at once.  Ha-ha-ha.  Holy shit.  There's fucking murder in movies.  I'm not telling you about that.  Isn't that amazing?  Oh my God.  That is one of those things that is just, I mean, cigarettes, some characters in movies, the cigarette is part of their character. 
[03:53:00]  It's somebody who would smoke.  Why would you put a disclaimer when the character itself is a disclaimer?  Like that's part of their personality is the smoking.  They're irresponsible maybe in life in general.  Usually it's more of a tough guy thing.  So is it, I don't get the disclaimer.  Why bother?  It's not like you see a pregnant girl on film smoking.  Or if she was, she would be portrayed as somebody who is really bad. 
[03:53:30]  Right.  And that like, you use a little of your own common sense.  Not everything has to be written down for you.  Well, there you go.  Political correctness.  You know, I've smoked in movies and stuff.  Yeah?  Oh, you did.  But I never do it as myself.  You sound different.  You sound a little...  Do you sound, um, peanutty?  No.  No.  No, that's not it.  No.  I think you sound...  Oh, I know that sound.  Say something. 
[03:54:00]  I don't smoke.  You sound cashew.  No.  No.  It's not cashew.  It's something.  I can't put my finger on it.  What do you sound, Jimmy?  I'm a superhero.  Oh, my God.  I'm Almond Man.  Almond Man.  You're talking through your almond filter again.  Yes, I am.  And I can...  I always tell children,  Almond Man sounds suspiciously like one of my other characters.  Of course it does. 
[03:54:30]  But he's stuck through a filter.  Do you know it takes more teeth to chew an almond than it does to chew a cashew?  A man once told me that while treating my asshole like the mouth of a fuck doll.  She can't even reuse references.  I don't like his fake defrauder.  Oh, die already, you message board cunts.  Eat your own. 
[03:55:00]  Eat your own.  Oh, wow.  God damn it, man.  It's worth replaying.  It's worth replaying.  Oh.  What?  The...  Ron Kind.  Please.  The more Ron Kind ads, the better.  We should have new ones tomorrow, bud.  Please.  And I want to see some of the ones that are against, you know, the other side of it. 
[03:55:30]  This was earlier today.  Listen to this anti-political ad.  Or negative political ad.  Sorry.  Anti-Ron Kind ad.  With our servicemen and women facing death every day, what kind of congressman would try to gut military spending?  The wrong kind.  Ron Kind.  That's right.  Congressman Ron Kind is repeatedly voted to deprive our troops of the funding they need to fight for us.  But Ron Kind has no trouble spending your money.  He would just rather spend it on sex.  That's right. 
[03:56:00]  Instead of spending money on cancer research, Ron Kind voted to spend your money to study the sex lives of Vietnamese prostitutes.  Instead of spending money to study heart disease, Ron Kind spent your money to study the masturbation habits of old men.  Ron Kind spent your tax dollars to study something called the bisexual, transgendered, and two-spirited Aleutian Eskimos, whoever they are.  Ron Kind even spent your tax dollars to pay teenage girls to watch pornographic movies with probes connected to their genitalia.  Ron Kind pays for sex, but not for soldiers. 
[03:56:30]  If Ron Kind had better priorities, he wouldn't be able to hear this.  Ron Kind is out of touch, and soon he'll be out of Congress.  I'm Paul R. Nelson, and I approve of this message.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  Are you, Paul R.?  Sounds like a voice you would do.  I'm Paul R. Nelson, and this ad excited me.  It sounds like Frank the Crowder.  It certainly does.  I'm ripping you off.  I don't like Paul R. Nelson.  We used to argue frequently. 
[03:57:00]  He went into the Marine Corps, and I jerked somebody off in a rest area.  You know, I read a little bit about that study.  Yeah.  And it turns out it was a bill that was involved, like I said, a big sex grant that was supposed to look at sexual habits to help combat AIDS, other venereal diseases, and gay sexuality, older people, and what they have to go through as they get older involving their sex lives. 
[03:57:30]  So it was a whole study.  On human sexuality.  On human sexuality.  That they picked out.  And the women, there's nothing in the report that talks about teen girls.  Nothing.  It says women were tested during viewing of pornographic movies or erotic films.  Nothing about teen women.  This is all, like, picked apart.  Like, these were separate little things that he's just doling out tax dollars for. 
[03:58:00]  Soldiers need money.  Well, I want to know what bisexual Eskimos do.  So fuck the soldiers.  That's what they made it seem like he's doing.  Yeah.  And Ron Kine doesn't behave that way.  No.  We all know it.  Ron Kine.  Can we hear the other guy's voice one more time?  And by the way, it was like a 50-50 split on the vote.  I think it just didn't pass.  But it was something like 210 votes were for it.  Yeah.  So it really was one of those fake ads.  Here's that guy's voice again.  I love this guy. 
[03:58:30]  With our servicemen and women.  I actually.  If Ron Kine had better priorities, you wouldn't be having to hear this.  Ron Kine is out of touch, and soon he'll be out of Congress.  I'm Paul R. Nelson, and I approve of this message.  Oh, please.  We play that all the time.  All day tomorrow.  Remind us.  I just want.  You need to hear Paul R. Nelson.  On my machine, I just want him going, I'm Paul R. Nelson.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  I don't need the other part of it.  I just want.  Just.  Can you play it and then stop it?  Him just going, I'm Paul R. Nelson. 
[03:59:00]  Hold on.  See if you can swing that.  For the love of God, please.  If Ron Kine had better priorities, you wouldn't be having to hear this.  Ron Kine is out of touch, and soon he'll be out of Congress.  I'm Paul R. Nelson, and I approve of this message.  Oh, you can't?  I have to do it another way.  That's very funny.  I'm Paul.  I just want to hear his stupid name.  If Ron Kine had better priorities, you wouldn't be having to hear this.  Ron Kine is out of touch, and soon he'll be out of Congress.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  That's what I want.  I'm Paul R. Nelson. 
[03:59:30]  Also known as Sam.  Paul R. Nelson.  Paul R. Nelson is a douche.  I would love to just be in Congress for one term and come up with things like, and then  they would just say, like, Jim Norton voted to rename the United States of America shit  cunts.  I would just propose all the stuff that I knew would never get passed.  I would try to make the legal age for sex six months.  And it's actually your ad, and you're just sitting there like, yeah, I did. 
[04:00:00]  I'm all proud of it.  That's right.  I did that.  What are you going to do about it?  Jim Norton proposed that we change the age of consent to six months.  I'm Jim Norton, and I approve this ad.  My opponents.  My opponents wanted to fiend the homeless.  I said, let's teach women how to make bigger shits so we can laugh at their logs.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  By the way, people are hearing that for the first time.  That commercial wasn't a bit. 
[04:00:30]  No, it's a real commercial.  No, no.  That was a real commercial that is going on in Wisconsin.  Yeah.  Unbelievable.  That battle's heating up.  I got to tell you, this one's going to hurt.  Laura Green from Fuck New Jersey.  Oh.  She writes, you suck, stern ripoffs, XM failures, failures, XM failures.  There we go.  Yeah.  Wow.  Sorry.  Sorry.  That's going to hurt.  What's her name?  That's going to hurt a little bit.  Laura Green.  If failing means having many, many more listeners, many more times the listeners that your little 
[04:01:00]  hero has, then we're failing.  There you go.  Oh, wow.  We're doing both, satellite and terrestrial.  Howard's more listeners than he'll ever have ever again in his career, you dumb twat.  Howard's for free for the next couple of days.  Yeah.  Playing reruns.  And there's no buzz.  Yeah.  Where's that buzz?  Crickets.  And what does he do?  He takes Friday off. 
[04:01:30]  Yeah.  There you go.  That's smart.  There's your hero.  There you go.  All right.  But she's listening, and enjoy the show.  You keep enjoying this program, lady.  You keep it up.  I don't know what it was.  We got to go.  We got a meeting with that guy.  Who's that guy?  I don't know.  That guy.  Why do you have to meet with the father from Mork and Mindy?  I think he's the PD of WCKJ.  Oh.  Oh, I'm sorry, sir. 
[04:02:00]  Hey, there we go.  Shit.  I can't tangle with him.  I have to go to Chicago in December.  Were you there when we were preempted for minor league hockey?  The good old days.  All right.  All right.  We'll meet with you then.  That made sense back in the day.  We're on in Chicago.  They have an NHL team.  Yeah.  But we need to preempt the Opie and Anthony show for minor league hockey.  We were on 7 to 10 p.m.  Yeah.  Or 7 to 11 p.m.  They replayed us in the afternoons back then. 
[04:02:30]  Yeah.  All right.  Well, I hope I didn't affect my Chicago.  All right.  I don't want to anger that man.  He looks like somebody we know.  All right.  Tomorrow on the show, Jim Belushi.  Yes.  The Chicago guy.  Yep.  Oh, look at you.  Sharon Osbourne tomorrow in studio.  In studio.  Sharon.  So happy.  I'm reading a book.  It's actually really good, man.  Yeah.  Really good.  Yes.  And Dove's coming by.  Is he coming by or calling?  Oh, calling in?  Calling.  All right.  Dove's calling in.  He's a really funny comedian.  Yeah, I love Dove.  We want to try to get him involved in this show. 
[04:03:00]  Yes.  We need some new blood.  Time for some new blood on this show.  And Dove and his chick are huge fans.  They actually met because she came down one night.  This is how Dove and that fucking knockout met.  She wanted to see my set.  She had seen my set just because she was an Opie and Anthony fan.  And Dove's like, I don't think you're here tonight.  And they just started talking.  And they've been together ever since.  She's like a professional boxer or something.  She's just tall and sexy.  He can box too, though.  Dove can fucking throw down.  He's a boxer.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And a fucking stone fuck.  Matt in Michigan.  What's up?  Hey, I'm a new listener, guys. 
[04:03:30]  Welcome aboard, Matt.  Yeah.  Yeah, thanks.  See, the reason why I didn't listen to you guys before is I fucking hate how it's done.  You know, in this fucking, you know, his little idiot routine.  So I was like, I don't know.  And then I'd listen to you guys.  I'm like, man, you sound like me and my fucking neighbor when we're drinking beers at school.  Who's your neighbor?  John Mark Carr?  A girl would be cute with a little cowboy hat on.  Six guns.  Ah, she's too loud.  She'd be cuter if she was dead.  And then there's a silence between you and John. 
[04:04:00]  Silence yet understanding.  He sounds a lot like Stewie from Family Guys.  Matt, if you want to come over and drink some beers.  Wow.  Who does?  Uh, the guy just wanted to do the impression because it's really good.  You bastard.  Yeah, I'm a gratuitous asshole.  Sorry.  Thank you, sir.  We're glad you enjoyed it.  Hey, bye, FHM.  When's it out, Opie?  Next week?  Um, yes.  Somebody better get the information to the boss.  Next week.  It's going to be the December issue.  Jerry Ryan, J-E.  Not Jerry from the Facts of Life.  Jerry. 
[04:04:30]  Jerry Ryan's on the cover.  Hi, Blair.  Shut up, mush mouth.  Uh, she's our TV's hottest lawyer.  Shows off her briefs.  Bah!  I get it.  Ah, the laughter will ensue.  This brief's another word for underwear.  It'll be on newsstands next week.  The December issue of FHM Magazine.  There's some lovely girls in this.  Holy mackerel.  Jimmy, Anthony, myself in there with a bunch of our, our friends.  And you gotta see on page 79, when you get it, you have to see the picture of all of  us, because it's me, it's Otto and George, Bob Kelly with his hands on the shoulder, 
[04:05:00]  Rich Voss, Patrice and Bill Burr.  And Ron Kind.  And look at how, and Ron Kind, that's right, fingering all of our assholes with taxpayer  dollars.  But you have to look at Bill Burr, his face is obviously, he's been fucking whitewashed.  Yeah, what are they?  He looks like a fucking mannequin.  And then there's me, Bill, Voss, and Bob are looking the right way, and, and so is the  puppet, and stupid Patrice and Otto are looking off into the distance at nothing.  It's a fun picture. 
[04:05:30]  It really is.  Should you throw it up on Pal Talk real fast?  Oh, I make, I say wait.  Oh, where's Pal Talk?  Well, give him a long shot.  Give me, where's Pal Talk?  Give him a long shot.  It's over there.  Uh-huh.  Ah, it's frozen.  Ah, you get nothing.  Let me see.  Let go, we're rolling.  All right.  Over here.  And I'll show him this one.  Give him a long shot.  I'll show him this.  Look!  Who's that sweet boy eating turkey?  Who is he?  All right, that's it.  That's it.  What a sweet boy.  All right, that's all I get.  Oh, a sweet boy having some turkey. 
[04:06:00]  All right, stay tuned for Ron and Fez at noon.  Guys, it was fun today.  Thank you so much.  Hey, Fez.  Hey, Fez.  Hey, Fez.  Hey, Fez.  I like to see my sister getting more airtime on another show.  That's good.  My sister's all over that show.  How's the relationship going?  Song parodies being written.  Relationship's going well?  Yeah.  Yeah.  As a matter of fact, actually thinking about breaking the ice and having Dawn bring Fez to 
[04:06:30]  grandma's house for Thanksgiving dinner.  No.  Because at some point, the family has to be told.  Fez is under the impression that the family's very angry at this.  There are some people that are and others that aren't, and he's going to have to deal  with that himself.  But in the meantime, he knows I love him, so I'll give him all the support as a couple  that they need.  But some of the family.  You know your sister's going out with a guy from another show? 
[04:07:00]  Yeah.  Some would say, sure.  Yeah.  Jimmy just knows how to put an exclamation point on anything.  And get us out of a dumb bit.  We'll see you guys tomorrow.  It's crazy.  This is what it's all about.  Oh, I love this.  Wow.  He shows 36 double D's.

Who, who, what, who, who, who, who, who, who hurt now.  He just looks hurt now.  Anywhere.  With a Mound 12.  She'll flash.  She'll flash.  Hey, I'm all for it.  She'll flash.
