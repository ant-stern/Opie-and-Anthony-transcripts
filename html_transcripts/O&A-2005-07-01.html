<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show started with technical difficulties involving studio DJ Drew Boogie, who ultimately left early.  The hosts then discussed a ferry crash video from Vancouver, speculating about Canadian attitudes.  This segued into a listener call-in segment heavily focused on butchered versions of movies shown on network television. Callers provided numerous examples from films like *Smokey and the Bandit*, *The Exorcist*, *Scarface*, *Die Hard*, *Pulp Fiction*, *The Good, the Bad and the Ugly*, *Roadhouse*, and *Mallrats*, often using profane language to describe the edits and missing scenes.  The discussion expanded to include movie candy preferences, the annoyance of commercial interruptions, and the declining movie-going experience due to high prices and uncomfortable seating. A caller from Alabama sparked a discussion about regional accents, leading to a proposed Alabama vs. Tennessee caller competition.  The show also included promotions for Opie and Anthony t-shirts and a news tease segment.  A discussion of cleanfilms.com, a website offering edited movie versions, generated both positive and negative commentary, with the hosts riffing on the absurdity of the concept, including a discussion about "rainbow parties".  Technical issues resurfaced towards the show's end, alongside discussions of the Yankees and further listener calls. Pat, a show representative, was mentioned as participating in the Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest, and a hate crime in Howard Beach was briefly teased.

The show continued with a seemingly random mention of cleanfilm.com, followed by a caller, Ronnie from Queens, discussing the Showtime series "Huff." Mitch from Montreal then called in to celebrate Canada Day, sparking a humorous, antagonistic exchange with the hosts about Canada-US relations, including sarcastic comments about Canada's military and the hypothetical ceding of Montreal.  The conversation shifted back to edited movie versions on television and a new DVD player with built-in filters.  A digression on Blockbuster and its alleged practice of creating its own edited versions followed, along with anecdotes about the hosts' experiences with video stores.  A substantial portion detailed a mishap involving Anthony's cream cheese order and the anxieties of the show's young assistants ("go-getters") regarding food orders, revealing that some needed name tags.  A listener recounted edited versions of *Scarface*, and another made a joke about Ben's penis size.  The hosts also discussed a cockroach infestation in their office, with Opie recounting an incident involving a crushed and escaped cockroach. Harry T's remix of a shark-on-the-beach news report provided a comedic interlude, followed by a discussion of *Jaws*, including production anecdotes and bloopers.  Anthony shared his fear of bees and wasps, prompting related listener calls and stories.  A lengthy segment featured Elo, an XM Satellite Radio executive, discussing their publicity photo, the upcoming Live 8 broadcast coverage, technical setup, lineup, and humorous comments about performers and countries.  A jingle about Bruce Kelly, in London for Live 8, was played before the segment abruptly ended mid-sentence. Drew Boogie performed "America, Fuck Yeah" during a commercial break.

The show then opened with Opie recounting a dream about Ozzy Osbourne.  This led to their “fearful, fearful teases” segment, mocking overly dramatic news promos.  The hosts criticized the lack of accountability in modern news, highlighting a recent successful prank on Fox & Friends involving a large Opie & Anthony banner and announcing a July contest for listener-created media "assaults," offering prizes (with restrictions against cursing and touching reporters).  The second major topic involved Don, a staff member, recounting a lightning strike that damaged his house, including a 42-inch plasma TV and DVD player. Callers offered help, with one offering electronics replacements.  The segment included discussions of the damage, insurance, and the absurdity of the situation. The show also included Pat Battle jokes, numerous "fuck you" messages from listeners, and mentions of Drew Boogie in the studio, Pat from Menachia (participating in a hot dog eating contest), the Spider-Man rapist story, and Sam Kinison’s “world hunger” bit.  A caller recounted an experience at a massage parlor possibly used for prostitution, and Brooke Shields' response to Tom Cruise was briefly discussed.

A significant portion continued mocking news teases, focusing on vague descriptions of dangers without specifics.  A game of guessing a “common household item” possibly causing cancer (revealed or inferred to be Teflon) was played.  Other teases about infections, cedarwood grilling, and teenage car thefts were satirized.  Guests included Keith "Keith the Cop" (who fell asleep and had water poured on his crotch), Drew Boogie, and Pat from Minaki. A caller, John, mentioned the death of Gene Sisco, and another expressed anger at truckers. The segment heavily featured vulgar language, sexual innuendo, and offensive jokes, with a substantial portion dedicated to Pat's hot dog eating contest participation, including his training and the contest's rules.  A final montage of news teases and Drew Boogie's music concluded the segment.

The final segment primarily focused on a news story about Nicholas "Fat Nick" Minucci, a 19-year-old arrested for assaulting a Black man with a baseball bat, allegedly using racial slurs.  The incident, occurring shortly after 9/11, was due to the victim resembling an Arab.  Minucci's prior arrests for assaulting a Sikh man and stabbing a teenager were also discussed, along with his connections to the Gotti family and his appearance on *Growing Up Gotti*.  The hosts speculated on motivations, reactions (including Reverend Al Sharpton's), and the alleged robbery attempt by the victims. The conversation included racially charged jokes and comments about interracial relationships and physical attributes of different racial groups, referencing Jimmy "the Greek" Snyder.  The show ended with promotional announcements. Drew Boogie was mentioned as being in studio during the latter part of this segment.

[00:04:30]  We're the only radio show that makes you want to hate us.  I see the only radio show that makes you want to hate us.  You're the only radio show that makes you want to hate us. weed, I'm big, you know, let's vibe, I'm big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big 두ist.  Well, let me tell you something, my crunk- och, 
[00:05:00]  I don't care how many Dago, guinea, wok, grease ball, coombas come out of the woodwork.  We need new sounds.  Of course we do.  Hawk, get on that.  Drew wants in right off the bat.  What am I doing?  I got you on here.  No, nothing.  Just unplug the goddamn thing.  All right, never mind.  Well, Drew's going to help us out.  What happened, Hawk? 
[00:05:30]  It's on, right?  Uh-oh.  It's my fault.  All right, now try it out.  Okay.  Drew Boogie's going to mix for us today.  Of course.  You want to give us a little something-something to start the show?  Uh, no, I was going to do it over the intro music.  Oh.  I screwed it all up.  What happened?  You really messed this all up, dude.  It wasn't you.  Some button wasn't pushed up there.  Yeah, I was supposed to push that button.  You were?  I was.  Oh, now it was your fault.  It's all my fault.  Well, now there's no reason for you to be here. 
[00:06:00]  You already wrecked the whole program.  Goddamn it, I'm out of here.  I mean, unplug my shit.  They just show that, uh, the video of the ferry.  Yeah, that's a good one.  In Vancouver?  Oh, my God.  Oops.  Just taking out a whole yacht club, it looked like.  Yeah, yeah.  Bunch of yachts.  They backed up into it, it looked like.  They don't ya as much in Vancouver, I hear.  No?  Nah, it's a little hipper.  I don't know where they ya.  They ya in Montreal, Toronto.  Montreal?  Quebec. 
[00:06:30]  But Vancouver, I think.  Newfie.  Newfie.  I think Vancouver, they're like, uh, it's kinda like America up there.  Really?  Yeah, it's kinda like, uh, Seattle.  So they hate, uh, the rest of Canada?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Ah, anyway, good morning, it's the O.P. and Anthony program, starting off a little shaky.  That's okay, though.  We got Drew Boogie in studio, he's gonna be, uh, mixing all morning for us.  He brings in his infernal machines.  Yeah, he goes old school on us.  Those are actual turntables. 
[00:07:00]  He has two turntables with him today.  Where'd you find those?  A garage sale?  Ha, ha, ha.  Got them from, uh, got them from a neighbor.  Yeah.  We've been holding them in the garage for years and years.  No, you can still buy these new.  You can?  Yeah.  I guess for DJs, yeah.  I actually won these in a contest, but you can still get these brand spanking new.  Nice!  Wait, you guys have contests?  Mm-hmm.  It's a beautiful thing.  I'll show you the videos one day.  Yeah?  Do you just go off?  Just go crazy. 
[00:07:30]  Mmm.  Opie looks at those and kinda remembers, right?  They bring back memories for you.  You used to do it, Opie?  Yeah, it's a little creepy, actually.  You use turntables, so you have to cue it up.  Cue up the album.  Cue up the album.  Exactly.  Find the spot where it actually starts.  And then you have to, yeah, but then the trick is then you have to turn it a quarter turn.  Quarter turn.  And wait for a quarter turn.  Quarter turn.  able to start.  Because it speeds up, bro.  Come on.  Of course.  You don't want it to go...  No. 
[00:08:00]  It's a...  Let me take you down.  You don't want that.  Got a quarter turn.  Right.  Got to go quarter turn after you hear that.  Hell yeah.  What's up, Jimmy?  Hi, guys.  This is Jimmy.  I like his shirt.  It's a goof on the Got Milk shirt.  It says Got Mule with a question mark.  Where'd you get that?  Bonnaroo last year?  It was a Government Mule shirt, but I didn't...  I don't listen to Government Mule.  I just love the shirt.  Yeah.  They're one of those jam bands, bro. 
[00:08:30]  Yeah, they're good, right?  Yeah, they're all right.  They're definitely all right.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's the day before the 4th of July weekend and...  4th of July.  And we can't wait to get the fuck out of here for a few days.  See what I'm wearing?  I'm wearing my suit with the anchors on it.  Like the mayor.  Marion has a problem with us in Jersey.  Marion, what's up?  Nothing much.  I'm a long-time listener.  Ah.  Now that I'm paying to listen to you guys on XM opposed to listening free on NEW, I think 
[00:09:00]  you guys are taking too many days off.  Wow.  Too many days off?  Yeah.  You listen here, lady.  We don't...  We actually take less days off than we ever did.  Oh, my God.  It seems like there's so many more days that you guys aren't there than you're there.  Wow.  We've done a good month in a row here without taking a day off.  A whole month.  And we're going to take an extra day for the 4th of July weekend. 
[00:09:30]  Sure.  You know, I kept hearing the promos that we're going to get to you to work.  It just seems like we do, I think, because, you know, we...  You love us so much, it just seems like we're taking a lot of time off.  We're here on a daily basis, and then if we take vacation, you just remember the last  time we took vacation, and it seems like it wasn't that long ago, but it was.  I used to have a little guilt as far as how many days we used to take off, but the reality  is we give you guys 20 hours of original programming a week.  Oh, I know.  That's insane.  It's really insane when you're trying to, you know, be creative. 
[00:10:00]  I mean, this is a creative radio show.  You know, when you're a DJ and you just talk maybe five minutes an hour, that's a piece  of cake.  You should take no time off.  And we take less time off than any other high-profile jock in the country.  That's right.  Less time off.  You know, these high-profile, like, TV shows, like, you know, Letterman and Leno, they just  have to do five hours a week.  Yeah.  That's...  Breeze.  That's a walk in the park.  What a breeze.  Ant and I could do that in our sleep.  Five hours.  We do 20.  We do five hours in our sleep, and the rest we try to stay awake for. 
[00:10:30]  All right, Marion.  All right, bye.  Have a good day.  Thank you.  Bye.  Bye.  Thanks for your concern.  Chris, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  I got a Pat Battle line for Jimmy.  Okay.  Okay.  When I get home, the first thing I'm going to do is punch Pat Battle in my mouth.  Yeah.  From Smokey and the Badger.  I was on AMC last night.  Yeah.  They butchered it. 
[00:11:00]  Oh, I know.  You can't watch Smokey and the Bandit on regular television.  I had never even seen it before.  You scumbum.  Oh, yeah.  Instead of sumbitch.  Yeah.  Calls him a scumbum.  And how they dub the words in it.  It's somebody completely different.  Yeah.  The voice sounds different.  You know, we should get it.  We've talked about that movie over the years as far as, you know, the TV version.  We should get a copy of that.  It's so bad.  It's so annoying.  And what we should do is play the original line and then what they do now on TV.  It's not even that bad.  They don't really say anything that bad in that movie. 
[00:11:30]  It's not like they never use the F word or anything.  Yeah.  They block out all the goddamets and all that shit.  Goddamets are taken out.  We should start a petition to make regular TV.  Just stop showing movies.  Yeah.  Just stop because it's not worth it anymore.  There's no need to anymore.  I think that's...  There really is no need to.  Who is sitting there with an antenna and a few channels?  People have cable.  They got their movie channel.  Who?  Uptown.  No.  You think?  No.  Actually, they're set up better than we are.  There's probably many houses in Howard Beach that some underprivileged people can go and 
[00:12:00]  watch cable television in.  Well, they make it a big deal to the network premiere.  Yes.  First time on network television.  Who cares?  Oh, great.  You've seen it in the movies.  You've seen it on DVD.  You've seen it on cable.  And now, oh, I get to watch it completely butchered with a ton of commercials.  The network premiere of Titanic.  Great.  Great.  I can't wait to see it.  I can't wait to see it with commercials.  Yeah, and it comes out like six years ago. 
[00:12:30]  You're like, when was that?  What?  When did that come out?  And they make it sound like a big deal.  And sometimes you do, and I hate it, you get caught up in watching a stupid movie on  regular TV because they play like a half hour of it at the beginning and there's no  commercials or anything.  Yeah, they look in nice.  And you're like, all right.  And then a commercial comes up and you think, whew, there hasn't been a commercial in a  while.  And by the end of the movie, it's like, Jack, hold it.  We'll be back after these words.  What?  Wait a minute.  You just, but you just. 
[00:13:00]  That's so true.  And now back to Titanic.  Oh, Jack, hold on.  And we paused for these words.  What?  What?  What happened?  And then you look at the TV guy listing after the fact and you see Titanic from 2 p.m.  to 11 p.m.  11 o'clock at night.  You're still watching the movie.  20 hours?  Wow.  Oh, it's awful.  I was just watching just before we walked in the studio that the movie business is way,  way down this summer.  Way down. 
[00:13:30]  Yeah.  And basically, people are admitting they just would rather watch, you know, these movies  at home.  Yeah.  Isn't it a lot more convenient?  It's fun.  It's more than that, though, too.  I mean, you know, the movie ticket prices are just out of control now.  Yeah.  It's like $12 or something like that in my neighborhood.  $12 in the city now.  It's still like $9, $9 and change out in the suburbs.  All right.  So call it $9, $9 and change.  Call it $10.  Let's round it off.  And then you've got to get the, you know, the popcorn, some sodas and stuff.  It's ridiculous.  I like the Twizzlers, Opie. 
[00:14:00]  Or Twizzlers.  I like the big pack of Twizzlers.  I go old school.  I get some Raisinettes.  Raisinettes?  Mmm.  Which a lot of the movie theaters don't even carry anymore.  Not a fan of the Goober, are you?  The Goober's, uh, that's my second favorite.  It's a Peanuts?  My second favorite movie candy.  I hate Peanuts.  What's your favorite movie candy?  Favorite movie candy?  We'll be taking your phone calls.  Oh, favorite movie candy.  Hey, he's got snow caps.  You're insane.  Oh, God.  That is one of those wacky morning show topics. 
[00:14:30]  Hack radio at its best.  Movie candy.  But now they got, what do they call those new things they're selling at the movie theater?  What are they?  Oh, the, uh, the nachos.  That new thing they got out there, the nachos with some cheese on there.  I told you there's a movie theater.  It's one of these artsy ones in my neighborhood.  I saw them selling pretzels.  It's outrageous what they're selling there.  Well, the one near me, they sell smoked salmon sandwiches.  All right.  That's ridiculous.  I swear to you. 
[00:15:00]  Smoked salmon?  Oh, it has everything.  It has your popcorn and, you know, all the candy.  And then all of a sudden, one of the other choices is a smoked salmon sandwich.  That's what you want next to you in the theater.  Someone eating the stinky smoked salmon sandwich.  That's one reason I can't go to a full movie theater anymore.  I can't have anybody I don't know sitting next to me.  I can't do it.  Oh, big surprise there.  I don't mean for germs or nothing.  I just mean they annoy me.  People annoy me.  They twitch it.  You can't, at least if you're with your girl and she's sitting in the seat next to you, 
[00:15:30]  you could kind of share the little strip of wood that is an armrest.  You know?  That little thing.  Yeah, that is a little creepy, but you're sharing it.  You're sharing it with a complete stranger.  There's a complete stranger now.  You're elbow to elbow.  Might as well be jerking off in a bed.  All right, Voss.  Where's Voss?  What do you mean?  You don't go elbow to elbow.  If they have it, then that's it.  But you're like...  I usually put my arm on top of theirs and clutch the top of his hand.  What, are you like fighting for elbow space?  Well, you need something. 
[00:16:00]  You can't sit there with your arms pinned to your side perspiring.  And you can't sit there with them straight out like you're doing the chicken.  The fucking chicken.  The movie business.  They're in deep trouble as far as showing these movies.  What year is it?  It's 2005.  Redesign your goddamn theater.  Put some nice seats in there.  Well, yeah.  Most theaters still have...  Stadium seating.  Most theaters still have uncomfortable seating.  Yeah.  You know, the screen...  Dude, they're the same seats you sat in if you went to the movies in the 50s.  It's the same crappy seat. 
[00:16:30]  And the screen looks just archaic at this point.  It's not digital.  It's streaks in it and runs and rips and jujubees stuck to it.  We're used to watching our DVDs on a nice digital system or what have you.  Or the movies digitally remastered and ready to go.  It just looks better at home is what I'm saying.  Sometimes the picture's tilted.  You get that dusty corner up at the top because the projector guy moved the projector a little bit.  What about this?  It's just always slightly too dark. 
[00:17:00]  A little dark, yeah.  Out of focus.  I'd rather watch it on a nice widescreen television.  And now, you know, they're getting the DVDs into the stores so much faster.  It's like, why would you go to the movie theater?  None of these movies are that good where you have to run and see it the first week.  There's only a couple of movies that come out maybe once a year that you have to see in the movie theater.  And then the rest you're like, yeah, I'll wait.  And then you go into your Blockbuster or what have you or you go buy the DVDs. 
[00:17:30]  Yeah.  For the same price you would pay pretty much to go to a movie when you figure in the candy and everything.  I was paying much too much in late fees at Blockbuster where it just got better for me just to buy the movie.  It was a better deal.  So now I just buy them.  They're so cheap now, too.  Just buy them.  Remember when you used to screw up with video cassettes when it was the mom and pop video stores and you would lose it or it was so late that they wanted you to buy the movie and you'd get a bill for $100 for the movie? 
[00:18:00]  I don't know.  It was $99, I swear to you, $99 for the movie on videocassette.  Back in, I believe this is 1953, it was a reel-to-reel.  Me and Groucho used to sit and watch it.  Big videotapes, kinescopes of his old shows.  Let's go to the phones real fast here.  Greg, what's going on?  Hey, boys.  Hey, Greg.  Hey, Jimmy.  I wanted to let you know the all-time worst butchering of a movie they put on TV, The Exorcist. 
[00:18:30]  Remember when she says, your mother sucks cock in hell?  Right.  Ever seen that on PBS, I think it was?  She says, your mother sews socks that smell.  No, that was a Saturday Night Live, you dickhead.  No.  Shut up.  It was a Saturday Night Live sketch.  Bullshit.  PBS.  Yes, it was.  It was Lorraine Newman was in the bed, I think.  And Richard Pryor was in the bed.  Just stop it.  All right. 
[00:19:00]  Admit it.  Come on.  I'd suck.  Yes, you'd do.  All right.  Let's get on Virginia.  Ken.  Call him out.  What's going on, Ken?  How you doing, Jimmy?  Hello.  Hello.  Hey, the absolute worst movie on television has got to be Roadhouse.  The whole movie is just nothing but violence and nudity.  They get done with it.  It's a 20-minute movie.  You're all forgetting the major one they ruined, Scarface.  Yes, Scarface.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, is that bad?  Because there's a lot of bad language in that one.  Your mother fakers.  Yeah.  Your mother fakers. 
[00:19:30]  Mother fakers.  TBS should just be, somebody should mail white powder in an envelope to that awful network  and they should never be allowed to broadcast again.  No.  TBS on a TBS world premiere.  What?  What?  Is this the first time you're screwing this movie up?  All right, let's say hi to Tom in Philly.  Tom?  Hey, Tom.  Hey, how you doing, guys?  Hey.  When Spike TV shows Silence of the Lambs, they touted it as being uncut.  There's two things about it, though. 
[00:20:00]  So it worked.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I was interested in that.  Blip, blip.  All right.  Call back.  Yeah, call back, Tom.  Let's go to David in Ohio.  David, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, bubba boys?  B-b-b-b-boys.  Hi, Judy.  What's up, David?  What can I do for you?  Hey, I just, you guys were mentioning earlier that you were looking for new sound bits.  Yeah.  I just had a couple suggestions if you want them.  Yeah, let's go.  Space balls.  Remember where he says, keep firing, assholes? 
[00:20:30]  I don't know.  I thought that was a good one.  I'm glad you did.  Or how about...  Oh.  Good thing I got my seatbelt on.  Didn't help.  I'm going to bail.  Let's go to Alabama.  Dolan.  It ain't Dolan, it's Donald.  Donald?  Oh.  Yeah.  What's going on, boy?  Someone wrote Dolan.  I thought your name was Dolan.  And they do things a little differently in Alabama, so I thought Dolan.  No.  I thought it was Doyle. 
[00:21:00]  All right.  What's up, Donald?  Shit.  I'm trying to figure out why Opie thinks everybody from Alabama is stupid.  I don't think you said that.  Wait, what did you say?  I said, why does Opie think everybody from Alabama is stupid?  Why does Opie think everyone from Alabama is stupid?  Yeah.  Well.  It's just an observation, sir.  Alabama gets a pretty bad rap as far as southern states go.  You know, we've only been at this XM for about nine months, and we're fortunate enough to 
[00:21:30]  take calls from all over the country now.  Yeah.  And I've just noticed that Alabama has a very unusual accent.  Well, I noticed every time I listen to you on the pre-play, because I never stay up long  enough to, hey, quit laughing.  I'm a truck driver, so I'm going to talk really, really long.  Yeah.  So, I usually hear you mostly on the pre-play, or the pre-play, and you always say we're stupid. 
[00:22:00]  Wow.  You feel free to quit laughing at me.  Donald, let's just, we're just not used to the accent yet.  That's all.  I'm just fucking with you, boys.  Do you really?  I enjoy the hell out of you.  Do you really talk like that?  I sure do.  Because he does.  Well, I don't know, from Alabama.  Yeah, don't take it personally.  Don't take anything we do on this show personally.  We're just having fun.  I'm not.  I'm just fucking with you.  I enjoy y'all. 
[00:22:30]  Let me tell you something.  Yeah.  Before y'all came to XM, I had one radio.  Now, I've got a damn radio in every vehicle I own.  Oh, right on, Donald.  Thank you for that.  I even bought three of them Spread the Virus t-shirts, and everybody looks at me like I'm stupid.  Yeah, my brother's still selling the Spread the Virus t-shirts.  Now, he's got a Pest t-shirt he's going to start selling.  Well, how about, can the boys get a copy of the shirt?  I'd like one.  Wouldn't you like to have one? 
[00:23:00]  Yeah.  That would be nice.  You have one for me and one for Imus.  Could he set off a couple of shirts?  All right, I'll bring some shirts in next week.  Opie, Jimmy gets shirts.  Jimmy gets shirts.  All right.  I don't know why Imus can't get his, because I've done got mine.  No, I think Imus finally got his, so.  All right, Donald, you keep calling, all right?  All right, dude.  Y'all have a good one.  All right.  All right, bye-bye.  Yeah, my brother's still selling the Spread the Virus t-shirts, and he's got a new Pest t-shirt  that's pretty damn funny.  Jimmy didn't done get his. 
[00:23:30]  Yeah.  I mean, I got an accent in my vehicle, too, and I don't know why I can't have a shirt.  You've got to love that accent, though, man.  That's a great accent.  All right, you can email my brother for info on the Opie and Anthony t-shirts, drduck,  D-U-K, at AOL.com.  Spell out doctor, drduck, at AOL.com.  Oh, the link's up on opiananthony.com, too.  All right.  You know what else sucked?  I saw The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly on TBS.  They cut just swaths out of that movie, not even for language and stuff, just for time. 
[00:24:00]  Well, because it's a really long movie.  It's a really long movie.  And it went from one scene to the end of the movie where nothing was explained.  There was huge, like, gaping holes in the movie.  What happened to that guy?  How did he get away?  How is he going to find the grave if he doesn't know the name on the grave?  They cut out the part where he actually told the guy what the name on the grave was. 
[00:24:30]  Where Clint Eastwood, yeah, when they exchanged, he goes, you know, it's about time we tell each other.  Cut that whole part out.  So now when the other guy, what was his name?  Tuco?  Tuco and Blondie.  Yeah.  When Tuco goes running toward the cemetery, I'm watching going, wait a minute, because I hadn't seen the movie in years.  I'm watching going, wait a minute, what is he looking for?  He doesn't know the name on the grave.  They had cut that whole part out.  Why did they cut that part out, do you think?  I don't know, because some idiot who has no clue what the movie's about is just going, whoosh, whoosh. 
[00:25:00]  They should cut out that machete.  That whole sequence with the, all of a sudden they're in the middle of that war.  They did.  They cut that whole thing out, too.  I never understood that part.  You know why?  It's just to make it an epic.  I kind of like that scene.  Do you really?  Yeah, it's cool.  It's huge.  It's huge.  But it's very different from the rest of the movie.  I know.  All of a sudden they're in this war scenario.  It is different.  What?  But I kind of like it.  It's huge.  Epic-like.  All right.  Let's go to the phone and say hi to Charlie. 
[00:25:30]  Charlie, what's up?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Charlie.  Pretty good, man.  Listen.  Worst movie ever put on television.  Die Hard.  The whole Die Hard series, but specifically Die Hard 2.  At the end of the movie, towards the end of the movie with Bruce Willis, when he's supposed  to say Yippee-Ki-Yay, motherfucker, they got him to say Yippee-Ki-Yay, Mr. Falcon, with  some other voice that doesn't even come close to his.  Yippee-Ki-Yay, Mr. what?  Mr. Falcon. 
[00:26:00]  Oh.  That was the guy that was landing in the plane, they called him Falcon.  Oh, wow.  That's nice.  That was the code name.  I mean, it really sucked.  But there were a lot of other lines that got cut out of the movie, too, but that was probably  one of the worst.  I think the fact that you think Yippee-Ki-Yay, motherfucker, is a cool line is what's really  irritating.  Well, hey, you know, it makes the movie.  It's his tagline for the whole series.  I know it does need an antihistamine.  Sorry about that, guys.  I'll punch it out.  All right, Charlie.  Thank you.  Stuff-nosed ass.  I smell bit, though. 
[00:26:30]  We could do something.  Yippee-Ki-Yay, but that, too, motherfucker.  I smell bit, though.  I think we could do something here.  Maybe take the TV version of a scene or whatever and then show the regular version or play the  regular version, compare the two.  Or we could have the listeners do their own TV edits to famous movies.  That can be really funny, too.  That's a little rough for the listeners.  An epic scene from one of these epic movies, and then all of a sudden they cut it up for TV  themselves.  That's a very hard homework assignment you're giving now. 
[00:27:00]  That is very hard.  I don't know.  That's like a final.  Yeah.  You're giving them a final.  It could be funny, though.  Maybe it has something to do with the Opie and Anthony show all of a sudden.  A famous movie scene, and then instead of hearing the line you know so well, it's all  sudden the line from our show or something.  Do you know in Smoky and the Bandit, there was one cut they made, I think to make it a  PG and not an R. This was actually in the film itself, when Gleason busts the other cops  in the whorehouse.  He goes, next time, wear your badge on your diety. 
[00:27:30]  It's the worst.  I know.  It's supposed to wear your badge on your dick, which is a great line, but they cut that probably  and keep it from getting R-rated.  Yeah, I know, and you're diety.  Oh, just horrendous.  How is that?  I don't know.  All right.  A couple more, and then we'll move on here.  Don't play with yourselves.  Dave in Vermont.  What's up, Dave?  Hey, do the right thing.  Little Jimmy, you probably know this better than those two.  But there's a scene in a Korean deli where Ricky Raheem comes in.  There's a lot of motherfuckers being thrown around. 
[00:28:00]  And they're throwing Mickey Fickey in instead.  Mickey Fickey?  It's one of those where I was watching by my buddies in college, and now instead of  motherfucker all the time, we say Mickey Fickey.  Kind of not always a bad thing.  As you suck each other's dicks.  Mickey Fickey.  Come here.  Come here, you Mickey Fickey.  Mickey Fickey is kind of like Alpha Bravo, but it's from my face.  Where should I come?  Mickey Fickey.  Mickey Fickey.  Connor, what's going on? 
[00:28:30]  Hey, what's up?  Hello, Connor.  What's up, Connor?  In the Big Lebowski, they play it on Comedy Central.  When Walter says, this is what happens when you're fucking straight in the ass, they go,  this is what happens when you find a stranger in the Alps.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, some of them make no sense at all.  No sense.  You watch, you're like, what?  Who the?  Who's at the network thinking that's a great idea, you know?  At least make it make sense.  Yeah.  Hey, Jimmy, you there?  All right. 
[00:29:00]  Let's say hi to Larry on Long Island.  Larry.  Hey, boys.  Hey.  You're going to find your dog dead in the hallway, Larry.  Yeah.  What's up?  You watch Mallrats on TBS.  Jay has a different voice throughout the movie.  Oh, really?  And I have no facts to back that up, so I'm punching out.  That's all you had?  Jesus.  Anthony on Long Island.  What's up, Anthony?  Hey.  What's up, guys?  How you doing?  Hey.  I'm coming to America on TV.  Samuel Jackson got the line in the McDowell's.  Who the fuck is this asshole?  Yeah.  On TV, it's who the heck is this egg roll? 
[00:29:30]  I want to hear some examples of this now.  I remember this one.  Kevin from Yonkers says in Die Hard 3, remember the sandwich sign that Bruce Willis had to wear  that said, I hate niggers, and he's in an urban setting?  Why did he have to wear that?  It was something that the guy that was calling, the bad guy, said he had to wear or else he  was going to do something evil, so he made him wear that sign in the city. 
[00:30:00]  And instead of that, they kind of superimposed the word everyone.  So it says, I hate everyone on the sign as he walks around.  It doesn't make sense.  It doesn't make sense.  Yeah.  It would be like, well, who cares?  It wrecks the scene.  It totally wrecks the scene.  I don't know.  I think that's a little bit better, actually.  Shut up.  Yippee-ki-yay, Mr. Falcon.  Rick in Tennessee, what's up?  Hey, how y'all doing there, old Nate?  All right, Rick.  Ah, well, whenever they put Die Hard there on TV, I know they always cut out a lot of words 
[00:30:30]  on there.  Yeah.  I want to know one thing.  What the hell y'all doing to have them Alabama boys on?  Because I'm going to tell you what, all you got to do is have his wife call, and it's also  his sister.  Ah, his wife is his sister.  They don't do that in Tennessee, though, right?  Nah, we don't do that up here.  Hey, dumbass Alabama boys.  They don't know what the hell they're doing.  I got to say, I think Alabama's off the hook, because this is, wow, Tennessee, wow. 
[00:31:00]  Well, shit, I'm all over the damn country.  I drive a truck, too.  Of course you do.  We're going to have to have some kind of competition between the Alabamans and the Tennesseans.  Well, hell, I mean, we don't fuck our own sisters down there, up here in Tennessee, down  there in Alabama.  They do them pigs, hogs, and everything else.  All right, we got to brainstorm.  We got to figure out what we could do with someone from Alabama and someone from Tennessee, 
[00:31:30]  because, wow.  I noticed that they talked weird in Alabama, but now I got to add Tennessee to the list.  Tennessee.  Well, I live up there in the hills.  I don't live up there anywhere near any big cities up there, so.  No, we're not talking like Nashville, Tennessee.  We're talking like way in the woods somewhere.  There ain't even a state highway anywhere near where I live.  Oh, really?  But you got the XM.  Yes, sir.  Well, only because I'm out of the truck. 
[00:32:00]  That's about it.  But y'all rock now.  I like listening to y'all.  I've been hearing you for about seven months now is when I got my XM, so.  Oh, thank you, Rick.  We appreciate that.  Y'all take care.  And I ain't been wild yet, damn it.  All right.  Well, thank you.  Keep working on it.  All right.  Y'all have a good day.  All righty, my friend.  Bye.  We hope they sure like to talk.  Well, I just like the accent.  What's this about?  We have a list of movie quotes right here for you of TV edits.  Oh, you found it online? 
[00:32:30]  Anthony, what do we got here?  Uh, let's see.  Are you kidding, Reservoir Dogs?  Marvin Nash?  This guy comes in, slashes my face, then he cuts my freaking ear off.  I'm deformed.  And Mr. Orange, laying there bleeding from his gut shot, yells,  Snot you!  Snot you!  I'm freaking dying.  Snot you!  What the hell does that mean?  He's saying, he's yelling, fuck you.  Snot you! 
[00:33:00]  Ferris Bueller, pardon my French, but you're an idiot.  Pardon my French, but you're an idiot!  An idiot.  No, it's pardon my French, but you're an idiot.  Yeah, idiot.  And Samuel L. Jackson in Die Hard with a Vengeance,  instead of saying motherfucker, says you melon farmer.  Melon farmer.  Unappropriate.  Cameron is, and from Ferris Bueller,  Cameron is so tight that if you stuck a lump of coal in his fist, 
[00:33:30]  in two weeks you'd have a diamond.  In his fist.  Ugh.  The usual suspects, the TV edit,  give me the freaking keys, you fairy godmother.  Ooh, Jesus.  Spaceballs, how many nimrods do we have on this ship?  Yeah, The Breakfast Club, I like that.  Flip you.  Please.  Alright.  CBS.  They gotta, they gotta put these words in, 
[00:34:00]  because we'll lose our minds if it's seen,  like the artist that made the movie actually wants it to be seen.  Is TBS out of Atlanta?  That's Turner's, right?  That's right.  What a shithead.  Ted Tyna.  Yeah, but you can't just,  you can't curse on TV, but you don't have to do it that much.  You can on TBS.  You can.  On cable.  It's like, uh...  You're right.  Yeah, it's like, um, FX.  You know, FX, you could curse on there.  Aren't those edits self-imposed others then?  Yeah.  Okay. 
[00:34:30]  All the TV networks do it, though.  Who's the hottie on Good Morning America?  Matt Lauer.  Teen girl meets Jaws.  Da-da!  Another girl with a shark attack?  What's this about?  I don't know, that's a pretty big shark.  Well, we're still not over there, though, so I can't...  Eric, what's happening?  Eric!  We'll get there just in time for the story to end.  Yeah, we are.  I'll have to do that.  Hopefully not my toes. 
[00:35:00]  Has anybody seen a shark in this area before?  There are sharks seen every once in a while.  This is a time of year they come in to have their pups.  It's a migratory time of year, but they're not usually inshore near where humans are.  And I'm out at Egmont Key in Wildblaze Sanctuary every day patrolling the beach looking for sea turtle tracks.  And I've never seen a shark.  Look, nerd.  They are there.  They live in the ocean.  And this is...  They are there and they live in the ocean.  She's a smart one.  I'm out by the right in the snack. 
[00:35:30]  And I have to say, if somebody were to see a shark, you know, observe from a distance, but they look a beautiful shark.  Yes, well, I just...  There are lots of different ways of looking at that shark, but I think you are now looking at what...  Look at the whole comparison.  There's this taut, friggin' blonde chick.  Trust me.  And then...  I know where you're going.  I'm looking at the right of the screen.  What side of the screen are you looking at?  I'm so looking at the right of the screen.  I know Diane Sawyer's on the left side. 
[00:36:00]  Diane Sawyer and this hot sugar in a split screen.  Anyway, thanks for joining us.  Thanks.  All right, so a girl saw a shark down in somewhere.  She sounded like some kind of marine biologist or something.  Who cares?  All right.  I look for sea turtle tracks.  Ooh.  Let's say hi to Ed in Staten Island.  Ed, what's up?  What's up?  The Swamp Lip, Dreamweaver, how you guys doing?  Doing all right.  Back from the spaz days.  One of the worst ones ever has to be Spicoli on Fast Times. 
[00:36:30]  When Mr. Hand rips up that paper and he's like, you dick.  He's like, you nerd.  They have to drag it out for like five seconds.  It's one of the more embarrassing on the W's ever.  He goes, you dick.  Yeah.  You nerd.  Actually, it's a lot of fun to watch Fast Times on regular TV because they had scenes that were never in the movie.  Yeah, because they've got to cut complete scenes out.  They cut out the whole teaching the blowjob scene with the carrot in the cafeteria.  Cut that whole scene out. 
[00:37:00]  So they've got to add in like scenes that they cut out because they weren't funny.  They weren't funny enough.  Sean, Staten Island, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, boys?  Good morning.  Good morning.  No, I was watching Bravo last night.  And you know the scene in Pulp Fiction where Marcilous Waffelous is crossing the street and Bruce Willis hits him with the car?  Yeah.  While he's sitting there, when Marcilous Waffelous gets up and starts crossing the street after him, they cut out that whole scene of him cursing and shooting.  Also, they cut out the whole scene of the gimp in the basement.  The whole scene was just destroyed and missing. 
[00:37:30]  You know, it's one of the best parts of the movie.  Another thing is when you watch The Breakfast Club on TV and instead of like all the cursing, you hear, you freak, you flippin' freak.  You flippin' freak?  You flippin' freak.  Oh, flippin'.  All right, car crash me.  I'm out of here.  Very good.  All right, Rob on Long Island.  Rob?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  How's my scared little kitten doing this morning?  You're not frightened today, are you?  You bet I'm not.  No?  No.  I'm happy to hear that. 
[00:38:00]  You know, I get worried about you sometimes.  Thank you.  I love that bit sometimes.  I don't want to break down the fourth wall.  Someone pointed out it's the fourth wall, not the third wall.  But I love that.  I like to break down the ceiling and look in.  Yeah.  That's what I do.  Or the floor.  You can look up girls' skirts.  Watch the movie Showgirls.  Showgirls.  Okay.  Yeah, the movie Showgirls on E!  Whenever they show it, since half the movie is just showing like tits and ass, they can't  cut the whole movie out, so they superimpose a bikini top on her. 
[00:38:30]  So, like, half the movie, they actually, like, digitally draw it, like, frame by frame.  It's one of the worst things I've ever seen before.  The movie itself is horrible, but seeing, like, bikini top drawn in is just one of the worst  things.  Why would they even show that on TV?  I know.  Why would they just skip that one?  I know.  They could cut it down to, like, a half hour, basically, you know?  It's gotten to the point.  I was tooling around the TV last night, and they had Tommy Boy on.  I'm like, oh, Tommy Boy, one of my favorite comedies, you know?  And it's already in my brain.  Why are you watching a movie on regular TV?  You know something is just going to be messed up, so why bother, you know? 
[00:39:00]  Oh, guys, Bo Bice from American Idol has a black tribute singer.  His name is Mr. Bojangles.  Punch it out, guys.  All right.  We're going to take a break.  Someone's saying stop.  Oh, a trucker's saying this.  Tony.  Tony, go ahead real fast.  Go ahead.  Hey, listen here, fellas.  I appreciate you taking my call, but I wish y'all would limit these dumbass truck drivers down there from the south.  I'm from Kentucky, and boy, I'm getting sick and tired of these guys making us sound like retards. 
[00:39:30]  Because I've got to tell you, I drive a truck.  I'm from the south, and I can actually enunciate every word that I say.  And it's driving me nuts.  If I want to listen to that shit, I'll tune in to the Bozo show at night.  I think they fired the Bozo guy, or they fired one of those guys.  He's got an evening show on XM.  But these guys ramble on.  I can't believe.  I know we're all valued callers for you guys, but good night.  Give me a break.  I know one of the guys that was trashing us really bad got fired or something.  I got a lot of email on that.  Whoa, the Bozo show or something? 
[00:40:00]  Or the Bumbo Bumbo?  I don't even know.  Yeah, it was Bumbo Bumbo with Dragonwagon that time he called in.  Yeah.  All right.  You guys need to ease up on that.  Jimmy, you're my hero.  Thanks, Mr.  Rob on.  All right.  What did he get fired for?  He did something like cooking in studio or some dumb offense?  I don't know.  Maybe we can find out.  We'll find out.  We're going to take our first break.  We're just warming up.  It's the 4th of July weekend.  4th of July.  It's upon us.  Anthony, on the way, we got Pat from Menachie.  He's in the hot dog eating contest, the famous Nathan's hot dog eating contest. 
[00:40:30]  Pat will battle some hot dogs.  They're going to have the weigh-in live on ESPN today, and he's representing the show.  That is so cool.  Is that really going to happen?  It's going to be on ESPN.  Are we going to be able to tune in ESPN and see it?  Is it taped?  11 a.m.  11 a.m.  The hot dog eating contest, that's become huge.  Of course it has.  It's become huge.  It's a sporting event.  And one of our guys is in it this year, and he's not going to win.  He's not going to come close, but it's kind of cool.  You don't think?  No.  He's not Asian. 
[00:41:00]  It's one of those skinny Asian guys always winning.  You've got to be Asian.  Yeah.  Because of the fat belt.  We're learning about this stuff.  It's a fat belt.  It's that whole belt of fat around his stomach to restrict it.  Meanwhile, the skinny Asian guy has no fat, so his stomach can just expand and expand.  Well, Pat's going to come in and tell us the ins and outs of hot dog eating and some  other things.  He should take a little piece of a hot dog and glue it to where his toe used to be.  Wouldn't that be funny?  A little funny foot with a little hot dog.  A Frank footer.  A Frank footer.  Also, we'll have the latest on the hate crime in Howard Beach. 
[00:41:30]  Hate crime.  Face of hate.  The story's getting more and more interesting, to say the least.  Yeah, this guy's got an interesting little past.  And, ooh, it's right in Keith's neighborhood there, huh?  Yeah.  That it is.  Yes.  Any inside info on this guy?  Absolutely nothing.  Yeah, I wouldn't say anything either.  He gets fired so fast.  He's a friend of Gotti, I would shut up, too.  Yeah, maybe you should just... 
[00:42:00]  Was he?  Not even...  Yeah.  He's a good boy.  He's a friend of Gotti.  He's, you know, Victoria Gotti's sons on that show.  Yeah.  Growing up Gotti.  Yeah, growing up Gotti.  Apparently, he's appeared on the show, and, yeah.  It's a nice thing.  Just a little...  Oh, I'll talk about it later.  No, we're going to get into it after the break.  Also, Anthony, the listener's doing very well with the news teases.  Thank God, I love these things.  Is it a teaser or teases?  A news tease or a news teaser?  I think it's a teases-es-er. 
[00:42:30]  A teases-es-es-es-es-es-es-es-es-es.  Yeah, that's the proper way to say it.  Because one of our young go-getters wrote news teases, and the other one wrote news teasers.  Let's just randomly pick teasers and fire the one that said the other one.  Do that?  So, I want to thank the listeners.  They're coming from all over the country, finally.  Keep them coming, by the way.  We want to go with this bit for a while.  But, when we get back, we'll play the latest news teases from around the country.  How they scare the shit out of you on the local news. 
[00:43:00]  Why don't I hear some bass thing, like, thumping in my head?  Because Drew Boogie's ready to get us out of here.  Oh, okay.  Drew Boogie, live in studio.  Hit it, Drew.  Yeah, let's see if I can...  Yeah, fuck.  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  Ah, fuck!  I broke...  I broke my knee, man!  I broke my knee, man!  I broke my knee, man!  I broke my knee, man! 
[00:43:30]  Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!  Oh, my hand.  Fuck, fuck, fuck!  Oh, my hand, yeah.  Ah, you mother. 
[00:44:00]  Like sands through the hourglass, so is the O&A virus.  I'm in a mood because his stupid socks are winning and winning and winning.  Seven games in a row.  Seven games in a row, two games in a row.  Ben doesn't even do jokes at you, though.  He'll just, like, list the facts.  He just does that.  Hey, dude!  Seven games in a row. 
[00:44:30]  Seven games.  I'm not a comedian like you.  Seven games, dude.  Isn't that wonderful?  And the Yankees' big thing is they have to, like, oh, they didn't get swept by the Mets.  Oh, I love it.  And they're talking like it's the best thing ever.  Yeah.  Great.  Big meeting with the boss of Tampa tomorrow.  I know.  It's going to be things done.  Steinbrenner and Tampa.  I'm sick of them.  I'm glad they're getting their faces smashed.  I don't want to see Giambi and Randy Johnson in Yankee uniforms.  Can there be no just enemies of your goddamn team?  Mm-hmm.  Holy shit, is that aggravating.  A-Rod's having right here, though. 
[00:45:00]  A-Rod.  Definitely.  I like A-Rod only because he was a bat for a bat.  But why?  Stop buying it.  And I never was one of these guys who said the Yankees bought the team.  I was never one of these guys.  No.  I like farm system guys.  Fuck.  Ring them up.  Somebody you can watch over the years and appreciate their growth.  Well, there's talk they're going to trade their top three picks.  Of course they will.  No, there's growth for some pitcher.  And it's either Barry Zito.  There you go.  Barry Zito sucks my dick. 
[00:45:30]  Top three picks, Jim.  Like the top three prospects in the organization they're talking about.  Jesus Christ.  They deserve to get the shit beat out of them for that.  Goddamn Steinbrenner, when he was out of baseball, this team was built up.  And they won three out of four years.  Oh, is that frustrating?  Yes, it is.  God damn it.  Can we take one year where you just admit, like, all right, this is going to be an off  year where you let some of that young talent develop?  Any team.  Pick your team around the country.  You'd rather give up the young talent, get a name, and flounder. 
[00:46:00]  That fucking Barry Zito, I can't tell you how...  I'd rather have Bob Kelly's leg pitching for the Yankees than that fucking Barry Zito.  Cocksucker, that's aggravating.  That's my fist bump.  I hurt my dynasty, man.  God damn it, it's that frustrating.  Fucking Barry Zito.  And Randy Johnson, what do you have in this...  That's one guy they're talking about.  They're talking about a bunch of different pitchers, but he's one of the ones...  Yeah, who are we bringing Jim Abbott back, cocksucker? 
[00:46:30]  Bob O'Hita.  Holy God, is that aggravating.  Kirby and Anthony, the virus is spreading.  The Kirby and Anthony Show.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Friday.  I'm all-  Oh, there's Bobby Rob.  I'm the vampire. 
[00:47:00]  They're the vampire.  Oh, oh, oh, and A  Oh, and A  Oh, and A  Oh, and A  Oh, and A  Oh, oh, oh, oh  Oh, and A  Drew Boogie live in studio today 
[00:47:30]  on the Opie and Anthony program  Freaking out everybody in Alabama  and Tennessee  Scaring the truckers.  Scaring the shit out of the truckers.  Doing something a little different today.  What the hell is that?  Well, God damn.  That's really good, by the way.  Really, really good.  All right, you want to do the latest on the Howard Beach incident?  You want to do some news teases?  Want to do the news teases?  That's always a lot of fun.  I love the news teases.  Oh, wait, we also have that, we have to do Harry's remix, actually. 
[00:48:00]  That's right.  Yeah?  Yeah, Harry is one of our young go-getters, Harry T.  He's the one that requests his own bits from cubicles while he's working for the show.  Goes into his cubicle and instant feedbacks and requests his own bits.  That's what I love about this show, by the way, especially with the young go-getters.  One day, we absolutely hate them and we're thinking about firing them, and then the next day they're heroes.  Hey, what is this?  What happened?  Joey Gay, not at XM New York City, says, can you please play Harry T. News, the teaser remix? 
[00:48:30]  It's really good.  I think you should play the Harry T. News teaser remix.  Yeah, please play the Harry T. News teaser remix.  Thanks.  Who wrote that?  Which one of his relatives?  No, he's requesting his bit again today, right?  He's requesting his own bit.  But now I think he's trying to make a joke of what happened to him about two weeks ago. 
[00:49:00]  But basically, you know, now Danny's one of the heroes of the show.  Because everyone's talking about that assault on the media yesterday on Fox & Friends.  It was huge.  It's up on opianthony.com.  Basically, he got on TV for at least a minute, right?  At least a minute with that sign?  Anyone that knows Danny?  Yes, about a minute?  So, it was a perfect assault on the media.  What's wrong, Anthony?  I guess there's something called cleanfilms.com.  Oh, okay.  We're going back to that?  Yeah, I know. 
[00:49:30]  Look at us.  I'm trying to do three different things here.  It's just handed to me, though.  And I guess these are reviews of their movies.  Okay.  We have received four DVDs so far, and I must tell you that we couldn't be more pleased with the movies.  It is such a pleasure to be able to sit down and watch a good movie without the offensive language, nudity, and gore that dominates the movies being released today.  That's the only reason to watch movies.  If one didn't know that they had been edited, one would think that the movie was originally produced that way.  Your movies aren't edited movies.  They're good movies that have been enhanced to be great productions. 
[00:50:00]  So, this is obviously a company where they take all the movies we know and love and really clean them up.  Ruin them, and then you can rent them there.  As a rule, my husband and I don't see R-rated movies because we don't want to be entertained by obscenities, crude sexual humor, and gore, even though there have always been some that we really wanted to see.  Thanks for eliminating that for us and letting us be able to watch a movie worry-free for our daughter's sake, too.  Thank you so much. 
[00:50:30]  Love it, Heidi.  How much of this crap do you think was put up by the website people themselves?  Yeah, I know.  Like, telling people what they want to hear, like, almost like a commercial.  Although, you know something?  No, there's people that, there are absolutely people.  My husband and I don't see our, Heidi, your husband at work is downloading so much pornography and jerking off to just the most heinous porno you can imagine.  He's just jacking and whacking.  Because he's a man.  He's a guy.  He doesn't want to sit there and watch these crap movies. 
[00:51:00]  Unfortunately, you've pussy-whipped him down to the point where he's watching ruined movies.  Oh, you may have cut...  For your benefit.  You may have cut his balls off at home, but...  Yeah.  He takes those balls to work.  He's got his work nuts.  He's got his work nuts.  And he keeps it in his desk drawer, and he slaps them on.  And the second he slaps them on...  Snaps them on like Mr. Potato Head.  Oh, that's it.  He's just spraying all over his office.  Hey, remember that daughter is Hobbin Nobs.  That they're teen parties.  That too, yeah.  We don't want our daughter watching this.  Now, you know what goes on at the party she goes to? 
[00:51:30]  When she's lying to you, saying that she's going to a party where the parents are home?  No.  They're having rainbow parties.  You know what a rainbow party is?  A rainbow party.  These girls go around, and they put lipstick on, and they suck all the guys' dicks at the party.  And the guys that have the most rainbow kind of win.  That's kind of like almost a little competition, because they have different colored lipstick on their schlongs.  And it's a rainbow party. 
[00:52:00]  Where did you learn about rainbow parties?  I believe I learned it from, let's see, some show on HBO.  That's really cute.  Isn't that great?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And you tell the girl to do it, because if you do it right, there's a pot of hiv waiting for you.  Really embarrassing if the boy comes home from the party with lipstick on.  Hey, rainbow breath.  We're moving to Italy, and the only reason we are not ecstatic is because there are no clean films there. 
[00:52:30]  Really?  Finally, you can watch movies.  Oh, yeah, they're real dirty.  With friends and family.  We have learned that even when a movie has a G or PG rating, it doesn't make it a good movie for our family to see, much less a PG-13.  By editing language and content, Clean Films has made these movies suitable for our family. 
[00:53:00]  What's the matter over in Italy?  Does the profanity block out the sound of vendettas murdering each other?  Vendetta.  Everyone's dead over there.  They're going to shoot each other.  It's an awful place.  Italy's a lovely place.  It's very violent.  I recently checked out My Cousin Vinny from cleanfilms.com.  This was a movie I'd long wanted to see, but never could because of the offensive language.  I loved the Clean Films version.  Virgin.  Version.  Version.  Thank you so much for your superb editing. 
[00:53:30]  These people are just crowing about watching censored shit.  Yeah.  Judy says, our kids are really enjoying the edited versions of your movie.  Yeah, kids, except for Chester.  We even sent one with our teenage son to a small party, and they loved the movie.  Ho, ho.  What's this shit on TV?  Okay.  Thanks again for the awesome way to view movies. 
[00:54:00]  Without the junk.  Well, okay.  With Teen...  Enemy at the Gates is our first rental.  And I want to thank you for providing such a quality editing.  With teenage boys who love war and adventure, I found it difficult to accommodate their desire  and not violate my biblical standards.  Ugh.  Like the most...  Do you know the most violent book in the world is the Bible?  Yeah.  Jesus.  I hate violence, especially that part where they're nailing his hand to a piece of wood. 
[00:54:30]  Yeah.  You idiot.  Eliminating complete cities.  That's wonderful.  You provide an excellent option.  Thank you.  Lot's nosy wife gets a big salt bath.  Telling a father to just kill his children and...  Psyche!  Why, God?  Why?  Why?  You want a reason?  Because I fucking said so.  Yeah.  Go ahead.  Do it.  Because I asked you to.  Because I asked.  You don't ask me no questions.  Well, it's cleanfilm.com. 
[00:55:00]  Yeah.  There you go.  Is that a commercial of any new sponsor?  No.  I had no idea that was out there.  Ronnie, what's up?  What's going on?  Hey, Ronnie.  Hey, man.  Save me a poke.  How's everybody?  What's up, Ronnie?  Let's go.  Good.  It's Ronnie from Queens.  You guys got that rainbow party from Huff on Showtime.  Oh, it's Huff on Showtime.  Right.  What's Huff?  It's a series.  Yeah.  Series on Showtime.  Yeah, Hank is area.  Yeah.  Okay.  All right.  Thank you.  Let's say hi to Mitch, our pal in Montreal, Canada. 
[00:55:30]  Mitch.  Montreal.  Montreal.  Montreal, they say.  Montreal.  Mitch.  Hi.  How are you guys?  All right.  Hey.  This is the Mitch, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  The guy you can't see.  Ah, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We love the Mitch.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hey, how are you doing today, Mitch?  Pretty good.  I'd like to say two things if I can.  Oh, of course.  Yeah.  Two things if I can.  Sure.  Okay.  First of all, it's Canada Day in Canada.  Hey, happy Canada Day.  What the hell are you doing? 
[00:56:00]  What is Canada Day?  I don't know.  I want to wish everyone in Canada a happy Canada Day to enjoy their freedom, which the United  States gave to them, which, and they didn't back up when the United States needed their  help during the...  Mitch, I like this Canadian flunky for us.  You're a good USA ass kisser.  Well, I'm not asking you a thing.  Right is right.  We live here in Canada.  We live free.  We live a great life.  Why?  Because the United States protects us. 
[00:56:30]  Never had a problem with another country trying to invade because they know that right  to the south is someone who's going to kick their ass if our retarded little brother  to the north is hurt.  And how nice were we that we gave you Montreal?  Because that was U.S. territory for a while.  You know, we don't have any...  The military here, we have nothing.  We have no defense.  That's how great our country is.  We had Montreal.  We had it.  And said, you know, eh.  Who needs it?  Too cold.  Who needs it? 
[00:57:00]  We'll just give this to Canada, and we have plenty of other cities to enjoy.  You could have this cold city.  You know, they bought five nuclear submarines from Britain that don't even work, and they  still don't work.  They can't get them to float.  They've got to pull them with cables on top of ships.  That's what Canada is about.  We have no military.  We have no defense.  We're here like sitting ducks.  The United States takes care of us.  That's right.  We're little children.  You guys are little Clifford Peach, and we are Ricky Linderman.  That's right.  To yourself.  You're among friends, Ricky. 
[00:57:30]  You know, we just want to be, we just stand here being huddled by the United States, like  little Jimmy would say.  Yeah.  And there's no thank you.  The United States has a problem.  They need some backing.  You know, even though at the time, Canada didn't know that there wasn't weapons of mass  destruction.  So what do we do?  No, we're not going to go.  Listen to this Canuck ramble on.  We appreciate your love, and happy Canada Day, but shut up.  Enjoy the breast of America. 
[00:58:00]  We allow you to suckle.  Suckle on the breast.  I am suckling on you guys.  That's right.  What the hell's Canada Day?  This is what we do for Canada.  We open up our little blouses and allow you to suckle.  Suckle.  Suckle on our greatness.  What is Canada Day?  The teeth of America.  I don't know.  I remember when I was living in Buffalo, which is pretty much Canada, and I don't know, there  was Box Day or something.  I remember that one.  It's Katie Couric dressed like a mime.  Whoever's dressing her. 
[00:58:30]  What is that?  She had acid thrown in her eyes.  She's a mime or a fag pirate.  Hey, Tennille.  She's trying to look younger.  But how old?  Six?  She went from looking 45 to dressing like a little child.  Was it Captain and Tennille or Shields and Yarnell?  The mimes.  I didn't mean mime.  Okay.  All right.  That's what I thought.  She would dress like that, too.  She looks like Tennille.  Tony Tennille.  Mm-hmm.  And the Captain.  What a fashion statement. 
[00:59:00]  Yeah.  Muskrat love.  They film porn in their old house in LA now.  Really?  Captain and Tennille's old house.  Nice.  That's right.  All right.  Let's say hi to Josh in Indiana.  Josh.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey, first of all, tell Mitch to take my nuts out of his mouth real quick.  And then second of all, I have a quote from Scarface on AMC a few weeks ago.  They had an edited version of it.  Yeah.  The original line was, this town's like a great big pussy waiting to get fucked.  Well, they happened to change it to, this town's like a great big chicken waiting to get plucked. 
[00:59:30]  Oh, God.  Oh.  Fussing out, guys.  See you.  Thank you.  I want to hear some of this in audio form.  We've got to start collecting the movie edits.  Yeah.  That they do on TV.  Oh, what happened?  I was going to read that.  What happened?  What happened to that?  Okay.  Episode three, Anthony, of Huff on Showtime.  Lipstick on your panties.  With the pressure of the parents' lawsuit building, it's almost a relief for Huff to deal with the normal family crisis.  But when his 14-year-old son, Bird, sneaks off for a disturbing teenage party and has found out Huff has trouble convincing his wife, Beth, that there's anything normal about it. 
[01:00:00]  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  She was a little upset.  Just a bit, right?  14-year-old.  See, that's what you get on cable.  14-year-old, your children come home at 14 and tells the parents about a rainbow party where they get their dick sucked and the girls leave lipstick rings around it.  Right.  How are the networks competing?  How the hell are they competing?  They can't.  Of course they can't. 
[01:00:30]  Josh, what's up?  What's going on?  How are you, Josh?  Ben's hog is so...  Wow, what happened?  Josh!  Josh!  Ben's hog is so big it interfered with his cell reception.  Ben's hog is so big it uses Canada as a cum rag.  That's what you want to say.  Let's say hi to Kenny in Illinois.  Kenny.  Yo.  Yo.  You guys are a step behind us today.  Sometimes it's good to just go to the phone and you guys say what you have to say. 
[01:01:00]  Instead of the big setup where you have to say hi to everybody.  Come on, Kenny.  Let's go.  The thing is, it's Canada Day up there.  Those guys don't even know what it is.  We were up there fishing.  And you ask people that live up there and one guy will tell you, oh, it's like the 4th of July down there.  Next guy, oh, it's like your Independence Day.  Next guy, oh, it's like your Labor Day.  Nobody even knows what it is.  It's just a holiday where nobody has to go to work.  Well, you know what it is.  I mean, they see how cool, you know, the 4th of July is in the United States and they just want to be a part of it. 
[01:01:30]  So then they look at their own, like, calendar and history and go, hmm, what happened around the 4th of July where we could capitalize on?  So we could blow off some fireworks as well.  That's all that's about.  Ah, see, they don't even know what it is.  All right.  I still don't know what it is.  All right, Kenny, thank you.  Yeah, have a good one.  Happy birthday, Canada Day.  Ah, here we go.  All right, let her rip.  This is where Eric is great.  He shines for us. 
[01:02:00]  Canada has a birthday on July 1st.  Canada Day is a national holiday in Canada that is celebrated with family, picnics, barbecues, and fireworks, Anthony.  Canada Day is always observed on July 1st, unless that date falls on a Sunday, in which case it is observed the following day.  Ugh, here it is.  A long time ago, Canada belonged to Great Britain.  Over time, parts of the country joined together and wanted to form their own government.  On July 1st, 1867.  Ripping us off.  Tell them, Fred.  Tell them, Ben Franklin. 
[01:02:30]  The British government, under Queen Victoria, approved a plan which allowed Canada to become an independent country with its own government.  This new nation, which remained loyal to Britain, was called the Dominion of Canada.  At that time, the new Dominion of Canada had only four provinces.  These days, there are ten provinces and three territories.  Aw.  Aren't they cute?  So basically, they're ripping us off.  Hoo, hoo, hoo.  Ooh, break away from England, start your own country.  Wow, where have we heard that before?  Yeah.  Hoo, hoo. 
[01:03:00]  Tell them, Fred.  I used to have England tie a bandana around the monarchy.  Come on, we tied the Stars and Stripes around a big pole and marched.  Come on.  We did it.  Tell them, Fred.  We grabbed guns and shot the redcoats.  What do you got in front of you, Ant?  Hollywood riled up over Clear Play.  It's a new DVD player.  But it has Hollywood spinning in anger.  The $70 player from a company called Clear Play has built-in filters designed to skip over 
[01:03:30]  violence and nudity and mute salty language in 100 movies, including blockbusters like  Terminator 3, The Matrix.  The Utah-based company is adding more films to its filter library all the time.  Can't we give Utah to Canada?  It's just awful.  Please.  Take Utah.  It's yours.  Please.  Just take it.  We gave you Montreal and we want to now give you Utah.  These guys marry.  Come down and take the fucking state.  Eight chicks at a time.  All they want to do is dump loads in Utah and have 50 wives and all the big porn stars  are from Utah. 
[01:04:00]  It's just horrendous.  It has a menu that pops up and you can check little boxes in the menu and then as you play  the movie, it will filter out what you checked.  One box here.  Vain reference to deity.  So that would be any type of religious language you don't want to hear.  Crude language and humor.  You check that, all of a sudden, that's it.  You can't, it won't show up.  Ethnic and social slurs. 
[01:04:30]  Cursing.  Strong profanity.  What's the difference between cursing?  I guess that's like shit.  Where would fuck be?  Strong profanity.  Cursing is probably like, damn it.  Hell.  Yeah.  That's probably cursing.  Maybe even bitch.  Strong profanity.  What about the word?  Graphic vulgarity.  Graphic vulgarity.  Not just language.  I mean, visual too.  Like a whole section of the movie will just be chopped out.  Technically, how does this player do this? 
[01:05:00]  It has a filter inside of it.  So it knows.  You take a regular DVD.  It's not a special DVD.  And it knows that movie.  It's already loaded into the DVD player.  That movie where it needs to cut things out.  And they're adding more filters for more movies all the time.  Oh, so there's a list of a thousand movies it's saying, right?  Yeah, yeah.  So they've already filtered these thousand movies.  And they've got the technology and the player that will now filter it out of your DVD.  Filter it out when you're viewing it.  Yeah.  So if you put a movie in that's not on the list. 
[01:05:30]  You're getting the whole filthy, dirty movie.  Dirty, dirty movie.  Dirty, dirty.  Ugh.  People.  It's just awful.  I would rather they do that than, you know, edit the movies.  Like in Blockbuster or something, you rent the movie and all of a sudden something's edited out.  You can't find it.  But, you know, I just feel bad for the people that just want to live in that kind of world.  That's really awful.  I hope Blockbuster shuts down.  I can't wait for that place to close.  Just the fact they've never rented porno because it's a family estate. 
[01:06:00]  It just makes me nauseous.  I don't know what it is about Blockbuster.  I've heard all sorts of stories.  I hear they make their own edited versions of some movies.  Is that definitely true or not?  I heard the studio makes versions and they just make those available.  But I've had problems getting a few movies at Blockbuster.  Like some old classics that have bad language and stuff like that.  You know, it's kind of difficult to find some of those.  They don't have NC-17.  I don't know, though.  They had that.  I rented that clown movie from there.  Oh, Vulgar, was it called? 
[01:06:30]  Yeah, that was a disgusting movie, man.  And now it's at Blockbuster, so that blows that whole argument.  Yeah.  I don't know what the deal is.  Maybe someone that's an expert on that can help us out.  The old mom-and-pop video stores with the little beaded curtain that went to the back room.  That was fun.  I used to love that.  Go back there.  You didn't even have to rent anything.  You could just look at the boxes.  Just spreading that curtain to get in there, you just felt dirty.  Oh, dirty.  Before you even started looking at boxes, dirty people in there.  Yeah. 
[01:07:00]  Staring at the box.  Just look at the box cover.  The box cover.  You know they just want a jack right there.  All of a sudden, you're walking around.  You find yourself in the gay section with a rod.  Oops.  How did that happen?  I was in action.  I didn't mean to rent Uncut Hispanics.  Let's go to Randy in Virginia.  Randy.  Yes.  All right.  Go ahead.  Hey, Ben's hog is so big. 
[01:07:30]  Punchline at 11.  Punchline at 11?  You can't do that, Todd.  It's a little teaser on how big Ben's hog is.  Make sure Randy calls back right before 11.  That's what we do now, just like the news programs.  Yeah.  You want to know how big Ben's hog is, you've got to wait until just before 11 o'clock, Anthony.  That's right.  The Loch Ness Monster in New York?  Someone's hog is posing a hazard.  We'll tell you who.  Could your children have it fall on top of them? 
[01:08:00]  All right.  Here's the deal.  Let's get the Harry T thing going.  That's where we started this break 20 minutes ago.  Harry T, one of our young go-getters, two weeks ago, he did something that made himself  look quite creepy to everyone around here.  Yes, he did.  He was requesting one of his bits from one of the cubicles as he was trying to work for  the show, and he got caught.  He got to bring me my cream cheese this morning that I promptly just picked up and threw in  the garbage unless I wanted to spoon it out into my mouth, swallow it where my bagel 
[01:08:30]  was, which was in my stomach at the time.  It wasn't your fault, though.  You were just on secondary detail.  I was trying to do some kind of recovery, but it didn't help.  See, who was it?  Mike is his name?  What's his name?  Which one?  The baseball cap?  Yeah.  Yeah, Mike.  Mike got sent out for my bagel and cream cheese this morning.  He comes back, gives me the bagel, and there was no cream cheese in the bag.  No cream cheese.  And he promptly, like he was calling in an airstrike, he gets on the phone with Harry here 
[01:09:00]  going, I need cream cheese.  You're down there, right?  They forgot my cream cheese.  They forgot.  Cream cheese, we're on alert.  We're on alert.  I need cream cheese.  I need cream cheese.  And I did stop everything I was doing, the other food orders, to immediately rush back  here with the cream cheese, but I could see your face.  It was too late.  It was too late.  He screwed up.  Ben, the cockroach?  Yeah.  And forgot my cream cheese.  And then, yeah, Harry brought it back.  But at that point, the bagel had been sitting there.  I wasn't going to let it get cold.  Or, you know, the show was going to start soon. 
[01:09:30]  And I don't like eating during the beginning of the show.  So, I ate the bagel and threw away the cream cheese.  I've got to ask, I mean, there's a panic that's going on with the young go-getters.  What have you guys been told about food orders coming into this situation?  They can freak out.  Just don't mess it up.  Because I think now they're overthinking that they're messing up.  Yeah.  Like, they can't relax now.  No, I know.  It's the food thing is so nerve-wracking to all of them.  The first half hour is very tense.  Like, no matter what, the guy behind the counter hates me.  Yeah?  Yeah, because I'm trying to pay for everything.  He's not the only one.  Great, he'll spit in our food because he hates you. 
[01:10:00]  Mike, what happened?  What happened with the cream cheese?  I just, they, I always assume that they throw it in.  They've never not thrown it in before.  Yeah.  So, I just didn't look.  So, it was the guy at the store's fault.  Absolutely.  Not yours.  You said cream cheese.  Absolutely.  All right.  I got another problem.  I don't know that you're Mike.  I think you still need to wear a name tag.  I'll wear a name tag.  Like, I know Harry, and I know young Sam.  That's it so far.  Yeah, I kind of, I kind of forget it's Mike, but I'm getting used to Mike because, and it's 
[01:10:30]  not a good thing.  It's because of your screw-ups.  I'm remembering your name.  You know.  Mike, you don't bring back a dry bagel for a man like Anthony like that.  Guys, who do you want to wear a name tag still?  I'll bring home cream cheese for Anthony, Mike.  Who do you want to wear a name tag?  Like, I know Harry, and I know Sam, so I don't need name tags.  Mike needs a name tag?  Someone get Harry in here.  Is there another one?  Yeah, there's another guy that kind of looks like you, I think.  Are you guys brothers or something? 
[01:11:00]  Well, Clayton's definitely got to wear a name tag.  Yeah, there's a Clayton here?  Yeah, I know it's Clayton.  All right, Clayton has to wear a name tag still.  Mike now has his name tag.  There you go.  Do you all know this is Harry?  I didn't know that was Harry.  All right, you got to wear a name tag.  I don't like the Harry T thing, though.  The T thing is very presumptuous.  Yeah, what the hell does the T mean?  It was just my last name was too hard to pronounce.  Well, what's wrong with just Harry?  It's not like there's a bevy of Harry's roaming around.  Yeah, no one uses the...  I don't like Harry T.  It's almost like he's got a cool name that he needs everyone to say.  No one's been named Harry. 
[01:11:30]  Hey, did you talk to Harry T?  Harry T.  They took Harry out of the baby name book in 1990, I think.  Harry.  Yeah, what?  Harry.  Hey, Harry.  Harry.  When Harry T met Sally, that would have ruined that classic.  Harry.  No T on there, right?  Right.  What about young Sam?  Do you guys know his name yet?  Yeah.  Isn't he the wave...  Like the Fiona Apple-bodied boy?  Yes, Fiona Apple-bodied boy.  Right there.  Look at him.  Fiona.  Look at that emaciated arm waving.  I loved you in the last minute of Close Encounters. 
[01:12:00]  Yeah, get Sam in here for a second.  You should be floating out of a spaceship waving.  Asshole.  Sam is like...  How old is Sam?  20?  Sam, how old are you?  I'm 21.  And your voice still hasn't changed.  Oh, it's changed a little.  It was very, very high-pitched before.  Yeah?  Yeah.  You are a little guy, though.  Yeah, I'm on the...  Well, he's tall, though.  He's not...  But, I mean, at, like, 16 or something, you must have really just looked like you were  eight.  Yeah, I mean, freshman year of high school was a rough time. 
[01:12:30]  Yeah.  I looked like a fourth grader coming into this.  Oh, I looked like a fourth grader.  I was like that.  Yeah.  I was 5'2", 91 pounds, 10th grade.  Basically, and I was short, too.  You were short?  Until junior year of high school, I was about...  I was barely...  I wasn't five feet.  So it was like a little kid roaming around a high school.  Uh-huh.  That must have been tough.  They thought you were one of those young geniuses, like you were eight going to high school?  Doogie Houser?  Right.  A 10-year-old in high school?  No, I'm not 10.  I'm 16.  At this point, I'm still getting carded going into R-rated movies. 
[01:13:00]  Of course you are.  A year ago, I got carded going into a Syracuse mall because they didn't want hooligans in  their under 18 without their parents on Friday night.  Oh, how embarrassing.  Awful.  You do just look like a little kid.  And how hard was it to get girls in high school when you looked like you were in elementary  school?  Yeah, I mean, there was no girls until I got a little taller.  I needed some height.  Wow.  Were there any girls that kind of also looked immature in school, a little from the itty-bitty  titty committee or something?  Not really.  I mean, and those girls got nabbed up by the older gentlemen. 
[01:13:30]  Aw, you were just stuck.  At this point, are you poking fingers into vaginas yet?  Yeah, here and there.  That's great.  Well, it's good to see you're growing.  Yes, yes, yes.  How tall are you?  I'm 5'9 and a half or so.  Ooh.  Yeah.  But he weighs like a buck ten maybe.  I'm a good buck twenty-five.  Buck twenty-five.  Buck twenty-five.  Soaking wet.  All right.  So, do we need a name tag on Sam still? 
[01:14:00]  I kind of know Sam.  You know Sam?  Jim?  I won't remember.  Jim didn't.  Yeah, you better put a tag on him.  Jim doesn't, no.  It was nice.  The name tags the first day, that was really nice.  It was good because you didn't have to, yeah, think of it.  Ben and everyone just assumes that, yeah, we're going to remember all this.  Yeah.  I remember the interns, all their names by, like, the last week they're here.  Yeah.  It takes that long.  Which one's Clayton?  Clayton looks like Mike, kind of.  He's not here today?  He's off Mondays and Fridays.  All right, cool.  Must be nice.  All right, well, Harry T's the star. 
[01:14:30]  Not Harry T.  Harry?  I want to get rid of that T thing.  Yeah, we don't like it.  Unless that's a middle initial and your last name is sell.  Then I'll accept it.  Damn it, that's where Brian from Brooklyn, you beat Brian.  He says Harry T sell.  Very good, Brian, in Brooklyn.  Okay.  And Jimmy in New York.  No, I know.  I said you beat him out.  Hi, Ben.  And Ben wants us to acknowledge the cockroach that we found in the office today.  No surprise there.  Ben C.  There's a roach in the office? 
[01:15:00]  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  One of the people that don't work here saw a cockroach in the office from his house.  It was amazing.  And it was walking around his area and kind of found it.  And then Opie comes over.  Now, this is right next to me.  Opie comes over and very carelessly knocks it on the floor.  I laugh at cockroaches.  You'll knock it on the floor.  Cockroaches, the most disgusting insect on the face of the earth.  I hate them, but I have them in my apartment.  I have the big ones, man. 
[01:15:30]  Yeah, you get water bugs?  Madagascar hissing cockroaches?  What do you mean they're called water bugs?  Do you get those water bugs?  They're big.  Silverfish?  I used to have them when I lived in them.  We were infested with silverfish.  Why do you call them water bugs?  No, they're different.  Water bug is different from a cockroach.  No, this is a cockroach.  It's just...  No, no, but those gigantic roaches.  Water bugs were known...  Water bugs were also called roly-poly bugs as a kid.  The male ones, you can roll up into a little ball.  I don't have those.  How big is it?  And the female ones, you would try to roll up into a ball, and they'd crack in half,  and you'd laugh as a kid. 
[01:16:00]  How big are the ones you're talking about?  You might be thinking about...  No, they're small, like the size of a pea.  No, the one I'm thinking of, the water bugs I'm thinking of, they're called...  They're called water bugs, are the ones Eric is saying...  Are they cockroaches?  Yeah.  I don't know.  It might just be a nickname for gigantic roaches, but they're...  Yeah, gigantic roaches.  Water bugs were called, yeah.  Somebody asked me what to call in.  I mean, one of the callers can help with this one.  I don't know.  They are so disgusting, cockroaches.  So it's run around now on the floor.  So Opie tries to put his foot over it to like...  Because they were trying to catch it.  For what reason, I have no idea. 
[01:16:30]  But Opie puts his foot over it and goes, oh, it's under my shoe.  And I go, well, twist and disintegrate him.  So he twisted.  That right there is a silverfish.  No, I don't have those.  I got the big cockroaches.  It's the big, wide one.  So he steps on it and picks up his foot and it's mysteriously gone from the floor.  Nothing.  No remnants.  No nothing.  So everyone said it's in the tread of your sneaker.  So right next to me, he picks up his sneaker and there's the half-dead cockroach in his tread.  And he goes, oh, now someone's going to have to pick this out. 
[01:17:00]  And he lifts his foot up and goes to grab something.  And I'm like, not by me.  Not by me.  So it falls out of his shoe, hits the floor squirming.  So he picks it up with a paper towel and comes right over by my head with this paper towel full of roach.  I freaked out.  Roaches are disgusting.  I don't mind things like ants or...  You're sounding wimpy.  No, cockroaches, they're disgusting.  Alabama's laughing at you right now. 
[01:17:30]  Fuck Alabama.  Let them have the roaches.  I cannot stand roaches.  That's why I am so glad to not be living in an apartment in the city.  All right, Paul Anka checking in.  Paul?  Anthony gets cream cheese.  You guys hear me?  Anthony gets cream cheese.  Paul Anka.  All right, very good.  Lousy Paul Anka impression.  All right, bad delivery.  So Harry might be back on our good side.  He's been...  We've all been looking at him kind of...  In a creepy fashion.  Yeah, big time.  After he was requesting his bits from the cubicle during the show. 
[01:18:00]  But he came up with another bit, and it's kind of funny.  You want to explain your bit?  You guys played the UPN9U shark.  You'd explain it might ruin it.  Yeah, I think it might be better for you.  That's a good point.  I like how it kind of comes in.  He kind of just made a remix, basically.  All right, yeah.  I guess I could explain it for you.  Basically, the shark attack.  The shark they found in the Rockaways earlier in the week on the beach turned out to be nothing.  Just, you know, a fisherman caught this shark, it looks like, and somehow it ended up on the beach. 
[01:18:30]  That's all it was.  But the news made a big deal out of it, right?  It sure did.  Harry took the report of the reporter and mixed it in with something else, and this is what you get.  This time, it wasn't a shark attack, but a shark surprise when one washed up on the beach,  leaving many wondering, what's lurking off our coast?  Corian Mahalik is in Rockaway Beach with the latest for us.  Good evening, Corian.  Good evening, Brenda.  At this hour, experts have a very good idea how this dead shark got here,  while bathers are wondering, is it safe to go back in the water? 
[01:19:00]  This shark, swallow you whole.  Shaking, tenderizing, down you go.  Get a load of this.  This shark was rolling around in the water close to shore.  I was, I was, I was acting in the, in the town's best interest.  My kids, well, that means true.  This blue shark was seen popping out of the water till the Parks Department folks managed to drag him in.  I'm pleased and happy to repeat the news that we have, in fact, caught and killed a large predator 
[01:19:30]  that supposedly injured some babies.  But as you see, it's a beautiful day.  The beaches are open, and people are having a wonderful time.  Amity, as you know, means friendship.  Folks alarmed, especially after two recent shark attacks along the Florida panhandle,  one of them killing this girl.  Shark is the nearest man, and then he starts pounding, hollering, and screaming.  Sometimes the shark go away.  Sometimes he wouldn't go away. 
[01:20:00]  What do you think he'll do now?  I'll never put on a life jacket again.  And the shark is now in the hands of the experts for further examination.  This is not the time or the place to perform some kind of a half-assed autopsy on a fish.  We're live on Rockaway Beach, Koran Mahalik.  You began nine youth.  Hey, that's not bad, Harry.  That's very funny.  My only point is, and it was very good, I would have left the Kinder Boy line after that.  Yeah, it was coming up right after the autopsy on a fish.  It was there, but I felt it was a little too long.  It's better to keep it short.  But that's such a great line.  Yeah, you should have left the Kinder Boy line, but it's still very good. 
[01:20:30]  I just like the way he says, tenderizing.  Tenderizing, down you go.  All that made me want to do is listen to Robert Shaw talk for an hour.  I know.  He was great.  It took me forever to put it together because I kept watching the film.  Like, I forgot that I'm supposed to be cutting things, and I just spent the rest of the time watching Jaws.  Of course.  You never get tired of watching Jaws.  It was really well-acted, man.  The fish was cut.  The worst part of it was, it's just the opposite of what happens today.  The acting was brilliant, and the shark that you look at, and you're like, eh.  But at the time, you really didn't look at it like, eh. 
[01:21:00]  It was like, wow, that's a big shark.  Now it looks really silly.  It's going to be a bigger boat.  Jimmy the Creep from Newark.  Anthony, what's the fear of bugs?  I don't get it.  You were a tin knocker.  You never saw bugs and shit in the vent or ducts.  Yes, I did.  I don't have a fear of bugs.  It's not even a fear of cockroaches.  They disgust me.  They're disgusting creatures, cockroaches.  They give me what they call the heebie-jeebies.  The only fear I have of bugs are bees and wasps up in the attic. 
[01:21:30]  When we used to do work up there, a lot of times there were bees and wasps nests up in there.  I've got to ask you something.  Yes, sir.  Are you on medication yet?  No.  No.  No.  All right.  Why do I need medication?  Well, I'm just asking.  I don't need any medication.  I'm just asking.  There's medicine out there.  For bugs?  For things that bother you.  Things that bother me?  Yeah.  I don't think so.  I think I'm a rational human being.  Yeah, sure you are. 
[01:22:00]  I just, at this point in my life, I'm looking at things and I'm not tolerating things that would bother me.  Jimmy, you think he's a rational human being these days?  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  Why should I tolerate things that bother me?  Absolutely.  Floating microbes in the air?  You're completely correct.  If I could sit four hours in a room with you disgusting people farting and whatnot all day, believe me, you should have a partition built in here.  What would you do with a bee's nest?  That's a fear of mine to a bee's. 
[01:22:30]  Bees just scare the piss out of me.  I hate them.  I don't like people that go, they won't bother you if you don't bother them.  That's a lie.  When I was a kid, a bumblebee, I was running around in my little bathing suit around the pool.  Sexy.  And a bee landed on my stomach.  And by the second I looked down at it to see that it was a bee, wham, stabbed me.  Just stung me right there in the stomach and flew away.  I did nothing to him.  I did nothing.  You probably ran into him while you were running.  No, I was just standing there. 
[01:23:00]  I was probably eating a bologna sandwich like a little kid with my little crew cut for the summer.  And it stung me right in the stomach.  And ever since then, I don't buy that whole line, you don't bother them, they won't bother you.  And I'm scared.  I do the Brian Regan bit where you're walking down the street and all of a sudden if I see a bee, if someone's looking from a distance, they'll think I'm just having a seizure.  I'll start flailing my arms and duck down, run away.  I hate them.  They're scary.  So in the attic, what we would do, we'd get a can of raid wasp spray that could spray from a distance. 
[01:23:30]  Get by the access hole to the attic and spray the nest.  And then put the thing back on and get the hell out of there and wait.  And then go up and make sure they're all dead.  If they're not, you give it another spray.  And if they're still not dead, you go to the tit bar.  You have lunch there.  You come back at 2, pack your tools up, and come back tomorrow.  How we work as tradesmen.  Hey, there was a blooper in Jaws.  There's bloopers in every movie, by the way.  There was a few bloopers in Jaws, yeah. 
[01:24:00]  Craig, go ahead.  Hey, guys.  There's a blooper in Jaws.  It's when he's typing up the police report when a girl dies.  It says in the TV version, July 1st.  But in the DVD, you don't see that.  It's blocked out.  Yeah.  Because in the town scene, it says June 29th, the Kittner boy was killed.  Yeah, they screwed up the dates when the girl was killed and when the Kittner boy was killed,  all around July 4th weekend.  Yeah, so when they're typing up the coroner's report, it had the wrong date on it. 
[01:24:30]  Oh, okay.  I don't know why they did it.  They just edited it for the DVD version.  But in the TV version, you see the whole thing.  I'm a big fan of checking out bloopers in films.  Yeah, big fan.  All right, Craig, thank you.  Thanks, guys.  The opening scene of Jaws, the lighting's all messed up.  Like, the sun's going down.  It's dark.  It's almost down.  You notice that?  Yeah, and then it was really dark.  Yeah, whatever.  That's because they didn't want to show her fully nude, walking Chrissy, going into the water.  So it got really dark.  It was actually daytime when they filmed it.  They just put a filter on there. 
[01:25:00]  Are you kidding?  Yeah, it was daytime.  Oh, I didn't know that.  So they put a filter on it to make it look like night.  You know, because that scene is so creepy, because we've all done some swimming at night,  I'm sure, in our day and stuff.  And I was even thinking, even though they're filming for a movie,  how creepy to be swimming out that far at night.  Yeah.  Who was that girl?  She was a stunt girl.  In one of the most famous movie posters ever.  What's more famous than that shark rushing up?  That's an amazing movie poster.  Yeah.  And I have no idea what her name is.  She was actually just a stunt girl, not even really an actress, 
[01:25:30]  because they had to hook her in that harness and pull her one way or the other.  And yank her around and stuff, yeah.  Yeah, pull her around in the water.  But it turned out, you know, I remember that being really hot, though,  watching it as a kid and her taking her clothes off,  and then the underwater scene, because you kind of see her snatch a little bit.  You could almost see it.  Yeah, yeah.  That was really hot.  Susan, like this matters to anybody.  Pat Battle was her name.  Backlany or something like that.  Chrissy.  Daddy, my hat blew off.  I hope Bat Battle.  Bat Battle. 
[01:26:00]  Bat Battle.  I'm Bat Battle.  God damn it.  Hope and Pat, I couldn't do it.  Doesn't Bruce Wayne turn into Bat Battle?  Bat Battle.  There you go.  Let's say hi to Jim in Brooklyn.  Jim.  Good morning, gentlemen.  Good morning.  Opie, you don't know the history of psychiatry.  I know the history.  There's no such thing as medication.  Opie's so glib.  Later, guys.  All right.  We've got to take a break.  Oh, there it is.  Nice picture.  What happened?  See, look, you can kind of see snatch. 
[01:26:30]  That is snatch.  Yeah.  Wow, that is big 70s Earth Mamas.  That's definitely 70s Earth Mamas.  Oh, my God.  Where's that?  From our pals at MrSkin.com?  Very nice.  Jesus Christ.  The shark thought a buffalo landed in the water.  Trying to eat that.  Look at that.  She had not bad body for us.  Oh, yeah.  Stunt girl.  You kind of can make out the nips and everything.  Yeah.  With the underwater shot from below.  Bat Battle.  All right.  We've got to get out of here for a little while.  We're going to play in honor of the 4th of July weekend.  We're going to play America Fuck Yeah.

[01:31:30]  Well, Mike from Carolina  The fact of the matter is  That bumblebees can sting you  The queen and the worker bumblebee  Have stingers  They don't come out  Like the honeybee  And they don't die  After stinging with  Their stinger  It is the drone bumblebee  That usually hatches  Around mid-summer  That does not have a stinger  And is indeed harmless  But I must have been stung  By a worker bumblebee 
[01:32:00]  Very rare that you would be stung  By a queen  There aren't that many  And how do you know  So much about bees?  Well, Opie  I used to be a beekeeper  Back  No, I read about it  Forget Aristotle  Where's that red?  Here comes Professor Anthony  Slurping jackass  All right, we've got to go  Right to the phones  The big boss on the line  It's Elo, everybody  Hey  Eric Logan  Is this really Elo?

[01:33:00]  I'm going to file a complaint  Against my own show  What the hell is he doing?  I mean, he called me  Here's the thing  Doesn't he know  That the SEC rules  Say you can't do  Outbound call  And put him on the air anyway  Jackass  What are you doing?

[01:34:00]  I'm not  I'm on the road today  Oh, Jesus  Man, you know what?  There was a time  Anthony and I were bitching  At our publicity photos  Yours is so much worse  You have to change that, Elo  Which one did they put up?  What is it?  Am I in a suit or some gay heel?  You're in a suit  There's a wood wall behind you  You're smiling really too hard  And it looks like the camera's too close to your face  So you're trying to back up  So your chin's all fucked up  It's on the XM management page  Oh, Jesus  And how come you're so far down? 
[01:34:30]  Who beats him out?  Let's see  At the top of the list  We have, of course, Hugh  Hugh Pinero  And then who's next?  Gary Parsons  Gary Parsons  And then?  Steve Cook  Steve Cook  That's terrible  And then?  Joseph J.  I don't know  Teitelbaum  Yeah  Yeah  And then Eric Logan  You are so far down the list here  Well, I mean, look  Candidly  Obviously Hugh and Gary we get  That's fine  Steve, you know  Steve is one of the founding guys there 
[01:35:00]  Marketing guy  You know, really  I guess  Joe Teitelbaum  Nice guy  Attorney  You know, I don't know  You should be above him, though  At least  I think we've got to pump you up  In this hierarchy  I mean, Steve Cook  I can understand  I've got to draw the line  At Teitelbaum  I've got to be above him  Who's he beating out, though?  He's beating out  Some dude named Stel  Hey, by the way  That's pretty big, though  Because Stel's the guy  Stel's the guy  He invented all the radios  Oh, he invented the radios?  No, this guy Stel  Let me tell you about Stel 
[01:35:30]  We should bow to him every day  Isn't Stel the Russian?  He's the reason that  He's the Greek  Yeah, he's the Greek  He's the reason that  We're so far ahead  Of the other company, right?  Technology-wise?  Hands down, without a doubt  Yeah, this guy Stel  He is the Mac Daddy  Does he travel in an armored car?  So Sirius doesn't kidnap him?  Brainwash him?  He actually  When he flies  He has two helicopters  So you never know  Which one he's at  Yeah  I'm not kidding  When they announce this guy  At some of these big meetings  They applaud  They go nuts 
[01:36:00]  Because he's  Super genius  Stel  Stel  The white angel  And the last guy on the bottom  Who's he?  Joseph Teitelbaum  Joseph Teitelbaum  I thought he was an intern  I saw him in Washington once  He does look like an intern  Yeah  I had no idea that he's one of the bigwigs  Yeah, he's a bigwig  I actually asked him to get me some coffee  The last time he broadcasted in Washington  Yeah  He's got a  You know, one of the highest graduated guys  From the law school and Harvard and all that 
[01:36:30]  To even the Ivy Leaguers  So I'm sure he can snap right to it  I think you should ask him for coffee  He'd be great  Dude, your picture  It looks like you need to take a shit  No, I'm going to give you yesterday  Yeah, exactly  You look like how I was feeling earlier this week  You know what that picture is perfect for?

[01:46:00]  Because it must really be  A pain in the ass  To call from England  Of course  There's 1100  Whatever you have to dial  Oh, whatever you gotta do  And of course  We promised  In one of those red phone booths  With the little window panes  All over it  Hello  Hello  Of course we promised  That we wouldn't hang up on him  Right?  Of course we did  Yeah, because this is a very important weekend  For XM  It is  And we would love to have live reports  Before the concert begins  By the way  Yes  We're going into the news teases now  Yeah  Before we do  I just had to tell you this dream I had  Very quickly 
[01:46:30]  Uh oh  Uh oh  I dreamed I walked  I dreamed I walked into an Ozzy concert  Yeah  And Ozzy was on stage singing  And he looked over and went  Hey Jimmy  I sort of go  Did you go see the Osbournes?  And I'm like  No, I'm just coming to the show  And he went  Oh, okay  And we talked to him  In the middle of a song  In the middle of a song  Yeah  The whole dream  Ozzy was chatting with me  It's kind of cute  It is cute, right?  Were you scared?  When all the people looked at me  I thought  I got scared  Alright  We love the news teases 
[01:47:00]  This is our latest bit  That we absolutely love  And the listeners are doing  A great job with this  Yes  Want to set it up, Anthony  For the new listeners of the program?  The fearful, fearful teases  We have to  That come out of the news  We have to explain everything on this show  Because every day  The show's getting bigger  Every day  New people are getting tuned in  To the O&A virus  Right  So it's our latest bit, basically  You're watching TV  And your news teaser pops up  You know  You're watching maybe a TV show 
[01:47:30]  And the news does a little promo  For the 10 or 11 o'clock news  And they just try to scare the shit out of you  That's their job now  Is to  Quickly  Tell you  What you should be scared of  But not give you any details  So you tune in  You know  This car can kill you  We'll tell you what it is  And you're like  What if it's  The car I drive?  See the media challenged us, basically  This is where this bit  Came from  We've been doing these assaults  On the media  And we had a great one yesterday 
[01:48:00]  With Danny  Yeah  Fox and Friends  The video's up on  OpianAnthony.com  It's the latest one  And basically  It was a boring one  But it did its job  We were  We were a big time pest  You know  Danny just holding up  The huge Opian Anthony  You know  Banner  What have you  What are these things called?  I like to call them  Signs, I guess  Yeah, it's a sign  A big Opian Anthony sign  With our cartoon faces and stuff  And we got on for a really long time  And it's a national show  It was great  It was a perfect  Assault on the media  Well, the media's bitching  They don't think we should be doing this 
[01:48:30]  Because what they do is important  And we say what they do is not important  It's not important  It's entertainment  It used to be important  It used to be real news  Now it's just not even  There's no responsibility there  No accountability  They just get on  And try to scare you  So you watch the news  So you watch longer  So the ratings go up  So they can charge more for commercials  And everyone makes money  The bottom of their priority list  Is informing the people  What is going on in the world 
[01:49:00]  That's the last thing  That's on their list  And they used these teases  To get people to watch  To scare us  But now  They're just funny  Now it's gotten so ridiculous  That they're  Them trying to scrape stuff up  To scare us with  That it's become funny  And ridiculous  And I laugh at the teases now  Every night  Oh yeah  They pop on  And it used to kind of give you  That little feeling  You're like  What?  What?  Really?  But now I just openly laugh  Like  Now you laugh  Like you know  That's terrific 
[01:49:30]  That's terrific  By the way  A lot of people are confused  By that laugh  Yeah  We get these emails  And it's amazing  That some of the stuff  We have to explain  That's not  That's not from  Cape Fear  From Cape Fear  No  It's not the laugh  From the back of the movie theater  No  This is from King of Comedy  King of Comedy  One of the best movies ever  And then another one  We get all the time  It's Ecstasy of Gold  That starts off this program  It is?  I never knew that  From the good  The bad  The ugly 
[01:50:00]  The most annoying one  10 a.m. today  On sale  Ticketmaster  For July 23rd  At the Cleveland Odeon  God  How many times  Do I have to tell you people  The first show sold out?

[01:51:00]  The word hurt?  These are creeps  It's those little  Catchphrase words  That they put in  That are there  Just to scare you  Your credit report  Well yeah  If you have bad credit  I don't know about  Hurting you  It would affect  Buying things  And maybe someone  Is using your credit cards  Illegally  Is that what they're  Getting at?  I don't know  Plus it's supposed  To make your commute  Quicker  But some say  New carpool lanes  Could be downright dangerous  Some say 
[01:51:30]  Who said that?  That's the way  They work too  Some say  It's all about  Zero accountability  You don't have to  Have anybody  That has to  Account for that  Some say  Alright  You know who's saying that?  The news director  Yeah  I'm saying these lanes  Are dangerous  Go out there  And do a whole report on it  Some say  It's a good idea  To bash black guys  Over the head  With baseball bats  Some say  Some  There's no accountability  To that  Who's some?

[01:56:00]  To the Brooke Shields  Bathtub scene  What happened there Don  It's what time  What time of day or night  4.30  4.30 in the morning  4.30 in the afternoon  In the afternoon  Yeah  So it's 4.30 in the afternoon  A lot of storms rolling through the area  Thunder boomers  And what were you doing?  Sitting in traffic  Oh you weren't home  No  Was anybody home?  Nobody was home  What a stroke of luck that is 
[01:56:30]  Yeah  So you're sitting in traffic  Now you get home  Right  And what tips you off  That there was a problem  Maybe lightning strike  That would be the neighbor  Running over screaming  A screaming neighbor running over  And saying I think your place  Got struck by lightning  Now what would be the telltale sign  Would be the exploded tree  In the backyard  Wood everywhere  A tree  A tree  How big a tree?  Yeah  It's about two feet in diameter 
[01:57:00]  Two feet in diameter  60 feet high  60 feet high  Pretty big tree  And it was hit by lightning  Struck by lightning  And what did the lightning do to it?  Completely pulverized the thing  Just the tree no longer exists  Gone  It was wood fragments all over the place  It was a pretty old tree  It's an old sycamore  And that thing was  It's just  The bark was just flying off  Here and there  Well it's gone now  Wow  The whole tree's gone  The tree's gone  It went down  It hit  We had one of those torches  That holds citronella oil 
[01:57:30]  Inside  And apparently  The lightning went to the tree  Went to the citronella  The torch itself  It looks like bullet holes  Are completely through that  It shot down to the ground  About a one foot  By one foot  Diameter  Hole in the ground  Right where the torch was  The torch is leaning against  Where the tree used to be  It acted like a lightning rod  Kind of  Exactly  After it hit the tree  I just put an electrical box  Next to that  That feeds over to the house  Uh oh  Both electrical boxes  But the weird thing is  The electrical box  Well the electric 
[01:58:00]  Wasn't hooked up to the house yet  The boxes were just  Set into the house  So the electricity  Went from the  The lightning bolt  Went from the tree  To the torch  To the electrical box  Shattered that to pieces  Went over to the house  You could see  Where it burned  All the way over to the house  Through the wire  Jumped over from  That electrical box  Over to the cable system  Uh oh  Where it also  Jumped over to the phone lines  And to the downspout  The downspout  Looks like a shotgun  Went through it 
[01:58:30]  What's the downspout?  From the rain spout  From the gutters?  Yeah  Yeah and then  I guess  The electricity  Just arcing through it  Just blew holes out  Through the whole thing  There's fire  You can see the fire marks  On the side of the house  Where the fire was  Oh yeah  Here's the cable  Look at the end of his cable  That went into his television  That's to the TV  That's to the one TV  Did you have a surge protector  Or that wouldn't have helped?  I don't think that would help  No surge protector  Wouldn't help  Not lightning  No  Because it went through  You know  It didn't just go through  The power system  Look at that  That went through  From his cable 
[01:59:00]  From the television  To the cable box  And the RCA connectors  On that are just fried  They were welded onto  Yeah  We had to pry this off  Of the TV itself  On the big screen  So then I went over  To the cable box  Cable box just wouldn't turn on  On top of the cable box  Is the DVD player  So I turned on the DVD player  No power  So I'm wondering  I'll just take it off  Can't  It was melted  To the top of the cable box  Can you imagine?  So your DVD player  Was then melted 
[01:59:30]  To the top of your cable box  Well how big was your plasma?  It was 42  42 inch plasma  And just destroyed  Gone  Fried  Fried  No good huh?  What other appliances  Bought it?  The big screen  All the telephones  All your phones  Gone  So what about other things  Like microwave  Oven or  No the oven actually  Was stood  That's fine  So really  Instead of your whole  Electrical system  It kind of got the cable  Right  And went through there  And did most of the damage 
[02:00:00]  Yeah but it could have been worse  Because you know  I didn't have that  Electrical hooked up  From that  Because that would have  Just been  Every appliance  Every  All your wiring  In your house  Wow that is something  How old was the TV  The plasma was  Five months old  That's a heartbreak  Oh  Just getting used to it right  Yeah and the big screen  I couldn't care less  We never used the  The big screen TV  But yeah  You got the insurance though right  They were there that afternoon  They were up the street  Really?  Yeah 
[02:00:30]  They came that night  Like a good neighbor  State Farm was there  What do you have  Lightning insurance?  Yeah  Oh cool  So you'll get all  They covered that too  Oh yeah  Oh everything will be replaced  But now we just have  To get Verizon  We have to get  The cable people in there  To fix everything  All the lines  If you look at  All the cable lines  Coming off  Into the back of the TVs  You can see  Black smoke everywhere  Where it just  Zapped right into  That could have started  Fire in your house  Oh absolutely  This whole house  Could have burnt down  And the outside  You could see  Where all the  Where all the sparks was  Where the house  Caught fire on the side 
[02:01:00]  Could it happen  In our home?  Wow  Now the house  Was actually on fire  But it was raining so hard  That it would put  It out  Oh wow  That's a stroke of luck  So he was lucky I guess  What do you have  This drawing lightning  That's the second time  It hit your house right?  That's the second house  The other house  Yeah the other house  Got hit by  The phone lines  Got hit by the lightning  Oh so this is not  The same home  No  That's a little odd  Something's chasing you  Karma  Get the hell out  Of the studio  Lightning man  Yeah exactly  Following you around  Let's say hi to

[02:04:00]  Or something  What an ass  He's just making of himself  Everywhere  Yeah because I just read  The first two paragraphs  And she sounds pretty informed  On this  And a postpartum depression  And how she dealt with it  With drugs  And I think she's a little more  Qualified than Tom Cruise  Oh well  Tom Cruise has got nothing  Going on that's wrong with him  Everything's great  Everybody kisses your ass  What do you know about  How real psychiatry works  I don't care what you read  Stupid  And your sister stinks  As a publicist  Oof  The worst  She's terrible  She's pumping down the couch 
[02:04:30]  That'll get him  Into the movie theaters  We'll highlight the best parts  Of this and give it to you  In a few minutes  Sean from Florida  Before we go to break  Hey how y'all doing  Good  I need some advice  From Jimmy  Yeah  Hey Jimmy  I went to a massage parlor  Yesterday  And actually thought  It was legitimate  So far my advice  Is take testosterone  Go ahead  Nothing  No  Nothing  Alright can I ask now  Yeah  Again  Alright 
[02:05:00]  And the massage parlor  There was a lot in the door  It was all dark  And the girls were dressed  All kind of hot  And I  Immediately got excited  And thought maybe  I'd found the motherland  The massage ended up  Being legit  But then they take you  To a spa area  And the lady tells you  To get in the spa  It's a cute girl  You get in the spa  And she sits by the spa  And just sits there  And talks to you  For a while  And my advice to you  Was  What are they waiting for  Keywords or what  I've never been 
[02:05:30]  In that situation  But I imagine  They're waiting for you  To indicate that  You'd like something else  Because it's not legit  First of all  If they're all lined up  Like that  Very rarely is that  A legitimate massage  Right right  They don't care  About what they look like  It's that  Pick the girl  You want  Kind of  Mentality  And you didn't  What's that  I noticed that  I was at the  The massage was like  This 50 year old  Swedish lady actually  And they put you  In a shower  And I noticed  I could hear  This man getting  Dressed with a girl  In the room  And I'm like  What's the deal 
[02:06:00]  And then I got  Into the room  And they said  The assistant  Will be with you  And she helped you  Out of your robe  And put you  Into the hot tub  And she just sat there  And sat there  And I actually said  Well do you get in  She goes no  We don't get in here  Uh oh  And then she helped you out  And sat you on the couch  And I just sat there  And I kind of got dressed  And it was this long  Awkward silence  Guy's waiting to get a handjob  And he's just getting  Dressed real slow  Hey come on lady  You just didn't know  How to talk to her  You didn't know  How to hint  You didn't know  How to talk about 
[02:06:30]  Being generous  Were the clothes  You were  Dude were the clothes  You were putting on  A police uniform  Maybe that was a problem  Yeah I put my nightstick  Back in  Well I had a badge  Around my cock  Does that help  Yeah  Wear your badge  On your diety  Well Jim walk  Walk him through it  What should he do  In this situation  And I sat there  For ten minutes  And asked her  I'm like  Am I supposed to leave  Or am I supposed to watch  And she's like  Am I making you uncomfortable  And I'm like  No but I'm sitting  Your butt naked  And that's happening  I need to go  I would have just  Started to  You talk light 
[02:07:00]  To them  Playful  You know  Nothing  Nothing too much  Like I'll joke around  Like sometimes  If I'm getting a massage  A lot of times  They come over  And you ask them  Like you know  How can we dress like that  For a massage  Isn't it uncomfortable  Like you don't wear anything  And she knows what you're saying  You're not being slick  But you're saying it  In a non-threatening way  Which is you know  Allow her to go  No I never do that  I've had a few  That would just wear jeans  And refuse  And this is at my place  I don't go to these other places  How about  Oh that massage  Was relaxing  But you know  I sure could use  Something else  That would relax me  A little more 
[02:07:30]  You know  Yeah  That's a little  That's a  It's a little creepy  Yeah  That's an awful terminology  Sure could use  Something else  Sure could use  I sure could use  Something else  Like a  Hand job  I don't say  I don't even wink  I just  I just actually will say  Semi-colon  Half parentheses  That massage  Sure didn't suck  Ah  There you go  That was a really  I say like  You know  I really  I mean  A lot of times  I'll ask them  Like we're just talking  I'll be like  You know  Do you ever wear bikinis  When you massage  You're like 
[02:08:00]  You know  Isn't that uncomfortable  Don't you ever wear shorts  Or bikinis  Just for comfort  And believe me  Again  They know  It doesn't sound like  It's getting to the point though  It is  Because you can tell  By their reaction  You're like  No I never do that  It's just weird  When she's sitting here  She was like  Babying me  And like  Putting soap on my back  And rubbing my back  And then it's like  Yeah so  All you had to do  Is turn over  And just indicate  What you wanted slowly  Like you know  It's subtle man  You just gotta know  What you're doing  Listen to the seasoned veteran  Veteran  I go for  I go for  I think it's just  A legitimate massage  And then I think  Oh this could be cool 
[02:08:30]  And then I  You know  I freaked out  Mention  Mention how relaxing it is  This is really relaxing  I've been very stressed  I just needed such  A tension release  You know  I mean  I really needed  Yeah you can say it like that  You don't have to be graphic  This way she knows  You're not a cop  Trying to entrap her  Right  You know  Little things  Again  It's hard to explain  Exactly what you're saying  Because I always liked  Not saying it  Because it's sexier to me  If it's kind of  You know  It just happens  Alright Sean  Well good luck to you  By the way  Every time I go to a drive-thru  They do say drive around ma'am  So  Ma'am 
[02:09:00]  Oh boy  You know what might work too though  The next time you're getting a massage  Just look at her in the eye  Then look down at your mule  And don't want you to tug on that  Little cookie  I guess the worst thing I could say  Is no right  Yep  Alright thank you Sean  Thank you  Bye there he goes  We gotta take a break Anthony  On the way  Pat from Menaki  Has entered the building  He's in the Nathan's  Hot dog eating contest  This weekend  So he has a lot to say  About that  Also we'll get back  To the news teases  I promise  As soon as we get back  The Spider-Man rapist  Has been caught

Every time you go into a tournament, you represent the Hama, and you come in dead last, you piece of shit.  I'd like to send out a big fuck you to Tom Cruise and the whole Scientology, supposedly religion, 
[02:11:00]  and take your e-meters and stick them up your ass.  You think it's a true religion. Get a lie.  This fuck you is from Drifter to Tom Cruise about mind-altering drugs.  You have the most best example of exercising and all of that coming from Mike Tyson,  and he's on the Zoloft, and he stands in the ring and rationalizes his sport being something pointless, 
[02:11:30]  and it's no longer for him.  Fuck you.  Yeah, I just want to give a big F.U. to the news media covering this poor Walmart billionaire  that died in his fucking play toy plane.  Fuck you.  Fuck Walmart.  Fuck all billionaires.  This F.U. goes out to fucking Howard Stern and all his fucking crew  playing the same shit he'll be and Anthony does.  Fuck it, baby.  Little Jimmy, my fans get beat.  My fans get beat.

First he hasn't signed for Jimmy in New York City,  then he ends up beating the Mets, that piece of shit, on Jami,  that steroid head motherfucker.  This is a big fuck you.  Yeah, this is a big F.U. to my wife.  We called the F.U. line sometime last month or whatever  for going to work every day and bringing home the money  so you could sit home with the two kids  and now you're mad that I'm out eating at restaurants?

We're going to get Pat from Menachia in here in a few minutes.  But we've got to get back to these news teases.  Yes, please.  Then we've got to talk about Brooke Shields and the Spidey Rapist and the 4th of July weekend. 
[02:14:00]  And blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Maybe for once we'll get everything done in one day.  I doubt it.  No.  No.  39-25 only.  I know.  Wow.  There are times we do this show and I think we didn't get anything done.  That's the show.  I know.  Not getting things done.  It seemed like we had a good show, but we really didn't get anything done.  We don't do anything on this show.  Even when we get stuff done, what did we really accomplish?  Nothing.  No structure.  Nothing.  People go to work. 
[02:14:30]  Houses get built.  Things get repaired.  People get from point A to point B.  We go on.  Nothing.  At the end of the day, yeah.  Everyone else out there could see what they accomplished.  Did something.  They could step back, look, and go, I did this.  Construction worker.  I removed like four, you know, truckloads of dirt today.  That's what I did.  Yeah.  Us?  I don't know.  We talked with our friends.  I know.  I made a joke about Pat Battle.  Pat Battle, yeah. 
[02:15:00]  I put Pat Battle into movies.  Like, instead of the quote the guy said, I said it, but with her name.  Pat Battle.  How many times did you do that?  Fifty-one.  By the way, I don't know why, but it is hysterical.  Every time.  It's never not funny.  That's the rule.  I don't understand it.  Pat Battle equals hilarity.  I love Pat Battle.  I disagree.  I don't get that one.  You don't get the Pat Battle?  Oh, B.  Well, let me tell you something else you didn't get.  Pat from Munaki. 
[02:15:30]  Oh, you're right.  At the beginning, you just didn't get it.  I'm a big fan of the Pat from Munaki stuff now, though.  Well, you don't seem to understand.  I was late on that one as well.  Yes.  Is that a man in Pat Battle's position?  Can't afford to look ridiculous.  See?  It just makes us both happy.  It's going to make a million.  All the listeners love it.  There's not one listener who isn't obsessed with Pat Battle.  I've never seen so many instant feedbacks come in with movie lines with some character  taken out and Pat Battle put in.  Even the listeners have taken to it.  Every time you guys do a Pat Battle line, this is what I do. 
[02:16:00]  No.  I get that.  Why?  Why don't you do some Pat Battle lines and you'll understand the addiction that is Pat Battle.  It is fun.  Yes.  Dude, I can't tell you.  All the kids are doing it, speaking at the parties, Pat Battle-looking motherfucker,  sweeping the nation.  Yeah.  Another thing we might do as early as today, does Pat Battle look like a bitch?  See?  It's a new show on Comedy Central, Pat Battlebots.  See? 
[02:16:30]  No, instead of doing stuff, no, we've got to do this.  No, we're doing stuff.  Oh, we're getting things accomplished.  Pat Battle, Star Galactic.  Pat Battle of the Network, Star.  Oh, see?  There you go.  Feels good, doesn't it?  No.  Do that to myself.  No.  That's what I do now.  No.  Anthony, something, I don't know if we could do it today, but in the very near future on  an Opin' Anthony program, it's come to our attention that you've got some weirdness creeping 
[02:17:00]  into your bones, some phobia, some...  No, no.  Oh, people are saying?  People are saying, Anthony.  No, they're not.  Yes, they are.  They are not.  Jimmy and I talk about it in the bathroom.  Yes.  That's sick enough.  Yeah, and he's getting creepier and creepier every day.  Have you noticed?  But, ah, this is what I say we do.  All right.  I don't think you're that weird.  Thank you, Opie.  I don't think your phobias are that out of control.  Not at all.  And I think on an upcoming show, we're going to go to the phones and see some of the other 
[02:17:30]  phobias that our listeners have that are worse than yours.  I'm sure you'd be easy to find, because I don't really...  Specifically, the OCD one is my favorite.  Yeah.  I have that in my family, unfortunately, but it still makes me laugh and laugh and laugh.  People that have to do just fucked up things just to leave their house.  Yeah.  And it's going to make you look like you're completely normal.  Normal.  Thank you.  That's what I do for my friend.  You know who had the OCD?  That guy from the show Double Dare. 
[02:18:00]  Oh, I know.  Remember him?  Mark Summers.  Mark Summers, and he had that, and he used to talk about what he did, and he had a rug  on his hardwood floor in his house, and it was one of those round rugs with the fringe  on the edge, and he would get down on his hands and knees every day and adjust every  little piece of yarn that comes out of the fringe and make sure it was sticking straight  out from the rug and none of them were crossing over each other.  And he would do this every day on his hands and knees to make sure that... 
[02:18:30]  He would have to do that before he left the house.  And that was just one thing that he had to do every day.  But then he went to work and worked with goop.  Yeah, worked with that green goopy stuff.  That's what I didn't get.  Like chaos and pandemonium as people trying to do that dopey obstacle course.  Yeah.  But it probably freaked him out.  Of course it did.  Is he better now?  Is that why he's talking about it?  I don't know.  He still says he has it.  Oh, what an asshole.  But all I thought of when I read about that rug was how nice that rug must have looked  with every little thread sticking straight out. 
[02:19:00]  You walk in and look at that rug and go, there's something very nice about that.  No, it's too perfect.  Rugs aren't supposed to be that perfect.  Yeah?  No.  Just throw them on the floor.  Yeah, plus if no one walked on it while he was gone, why fix it when you get home?  It probably, like, even a breeze from the door opening up across the floor would make  two little threads, like, cross over each other.  How about this?  And you'd have to fix it.  Get wall to wall or get a fucking rug without the stuff sticking off it.  Without 5,000 loose fibers.  If you're a lunatic like that, why would you have that rug in your house? 
[02:19:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Really fast.  Dan and Philly, go ahead, Dan.  Hey, boys.  Hey.  You sunk my pad battleship.  That's a very nice one.  That's good.  All right.  Dude, can we play the audio tape of just those fucking filthy phone messages from that TV  person, Paddle Battle? 
[02:20:00]  No.  Yes.  No.  That's very hurtful.  No.  It wasn't us.  Paddle did it.  It was them.  Drew, don't encourage them.  Please help me out, Drew.  I beg you.  I battle this every day.  You pad battle this every day?  Yes.  Don't encourage this, Drew.  Please stop laughing. 
[02:20:30]  I beg you.  Guys, stop laughing over there, please.  See it my way.  Please.  Love that war movie, Paddle of the Bulge.  Oh, okay.  News clips, right?  Yes.  We're doing the teasers.  Yeah, let's do the news teasers or teasers.  Yes.  Do we have to set it up again?  Nah.  Just listen to the replay.  We set it up a half hour ago and never got to this. 
[02:21:00]  Yeah.  But basically, they scare the shit out of you every night, and now we think it's just hilarious.  Right?  Right.  All right.  Here we go.  We'll start from the beginning.  And coming up, Asa, with what you don't know about your credit rating that can hurt you.  Okay.  We did that one already, right?  And this one.  Plus, it's supposed to make your commute quicker, but some say new carpool lanes could be downright dangerous.  Downright dangerous.  You know, they finally finished the HOV lane on the Long Island Expressway. 
[02:21:30]  I've had to deal with this every day, the construction.  They were putting an HOV lane.  It was the reason I had to move into the city, by the way.  Yeah.  You know how many people had to adjust their lives because the one highway that takes you from Manhattan to Long Island was fucked up for over a decade?  Twelve years.  Get this.  It took twelve years to make an HOV lane on the expressway that is about twelve miles long.  Twelve years, twelve miles.  Well, using that time frame, highway from New York to L.A. would take 3,000 years to build. 
[02:22:00]  It took twelve years to go twelve miles with these sons of bitches.  Someone should investigate this because someone got rich off of it.  Of course.  Someone made a lot of money doing this.  Yeah, why doesn't Chuck Schumer take on that car?  Where's Chuck Schumer?  Where's Chuck?  Oh, well.  Where's the old Chuck?  Oh, you're worried about the violent video games.  Oh, there's video games out there that show shooting and killing.  That's more important than a twelve-year job to go twelve miles. 
[02:22:30]  Billions.  And what happened?  Where is it?  And a lot of headaches from commuters.  A lot of pissed off people that go home and hit their wives because it took too long to get home.  But Chuck Schumer's not going to take on that cause.  And now that the construction's done, can we get street sweepers out there?  So when I'm driving in every morning, my car isn't pelted like I'm driving through a sandstorm in Baghdad.  There's so much shit in that road now from the construction.  You hear it sounds like it's raining. 
[02:23:00]  You know when you're raining, you hear the rain on the outside of your car?  But it's dirt and pebbles just pelting, pelting my vehicle.  It's an awful road.  Where's our dick of a senator when you really need him?  Yeah.  Stay away from the stupid, violent video game thing.  Yeah, enough.  Where's Hillary?  Yeah, where is Hillary?  Where are they talking about that?  Where did that money go?  I would love an accounting of twelve years of work on a twelve-mile stretch of road.  I personally don't need to know, Anthony.  I don't even want to get involved with that crap.  No?  No, it's not my business. 
[02:23:30]  Video games?  No, not my business.  No?  Let this stupid senator, if he really thinks he's helping us, look into it.  Yeah, do your job.  Yeah, let's see how far you get into that one.  They're all crooks in on it.  They all know about it.  They all got their hand in the till.  Just to have an HOV lane for a few guys in robes.  I mean, it's so stupid.  Let's go to the phones and say hi to Tom.  Tom?  Hey, I hope you all are yours, that was said.  How about the pack battle of Evermore? 
[02:24:00]  You're out, Tom.  I curse you all.  You're out, Tom.  All right, so let's move on with the news teases, okay?  Coming up on Fox 5 News, a water warning for all of New York City.  Why you need to boil your water and who's most at risk.  Who?  What?  Holy shit.  Where?  We're not even safe from water?  Where?  The water is deadly, Opie.  Who's most at risk?  The whole city?  The whole city?  That's the five boroughs.  What?  New York City.  Did she say where? 
[02:24:30]  No.  What water?  What's wrong with it?  What's in it?  What's in the water?  What's in the water?  Because you watch that, and she said who's most at risk, and you're supposed to go, I might  be.  I could be.  I better watch.  That could be me.  Fear mongers.  I hate you.  How about telling us who's at risk so we don't drink it before 11 o'clock, you dumb whore?  Help out.  Yeah, it's not like it's hot outside right now, and we're all dehydrated.  Yeah.  Who uses water anymore?  Right.  You've got a nice, tall glass of water right next to you as that report's going on with a 
[02:25:00]  lot of ice cubes in it.  Sinking around in your glass, ready to take your lips and go, mmm.  Now I can't drink the water.  What?  Boil it?  Until they decide to tell me where it's bad.  All right.  It's only summer.  Boiled water will cool off real quickly.  Yeah, it's fine.  Jesus.  I'll just boil this.  I don't want to hear about how we're doing bad by doing the assaults on the media.  No, exactly.  Tonight at 10, don't drink the water in the city.  A new warning for New Yorkers.  More details of a boil alert and how long it will last. 
[02:25:30]  Thanks.  Thanks.  A boil alert.  Did you guys hear that?  I didn't hear that at all.  I didn't hear anything.  You know what?  I'll tell you what it's on.  This is a thing that affects the entire city.  The entire city has to boil its water.  I'm going.  Oh, water boil.  The middle of the page, on page 8 of the Daily News, because, of course, the cover is the racial attack. 
[02:26:00]  Yeah, of course.  Yeah, that's it.  And the post, the same thing.  It's like way in, buried.  Well, what's the story, though?  Did we ever find out what's wrong with the water?  What is wrong with the goddamn water?  What's wrong with the goddamn water?  Don't drink the water.  Why, some drinking water in New York City may be contaminated.  And what do you need to do to stay safe?  Oh, God.  City official warned sick and frail New Yorkers to boil their tap water until noon today after muddy runoff into one of the city's reservoirs called the Glitch in Purifying Drinking Water. 
[02:26:30]  Infants, the elderly, pregnant women, also should avoid drinking the water.  But consider, if you're at risk, consider using bottled water even for brushing your teeth.  This isn't a major problem.  We're asking people to take precautions out of an abundance of caution.  He said that a rare citywide warning, only the third of its kind in the past several years, put this out. 
[02:27:00]  But it's really for people with weakened immune systems.  If you have HIV, AIDS, or leukemia, a bone marrow transplant, you should drink bottled water.  Jesus.  Yeah, this shouldn't be any problem to any healthy people.  That's what they're saying.  That's the real story.  There you go.  That's the real story.  If you're sick, don't drink the water without boiling it.  A slight, slight, slight danger, too. 
[02:27:30]  Right.  We might lose one.  We'd have lost them anyway if they had one of those three things.  There you go.  Floyd the Trucker.  What's up, Floyd?  Floyd.  I just heard this really cool song.  It's called Love is a Pat Battlefield.  Sung by Pat Battletar.  Dominic.  Hey, buddy.  Hey.  Amusable interlude.  Joshua fought Pat Battle of Jericho.  See you.  I love when the bit reaches this point where the listeners ruin it.  We'll get it back. 
[02:28:00]  Don't worry.  This one can be spoiled for it.  We're doing this until December.  I'm personally forcing the end of this bit.  No, Opie.  I'm going to go way too far with this bit.  No, Opie.  I will destroy this.  You are.  You're undermining the Pat Battle.  That's right, I am.  Tim, go ahead.  Let's hear your cute Pat Battle line.  No, no.  There's an interesting part.  If you watch closely in the movie Casino, Joe Pesci, where he's got the guy's head in  the voice, he goes, you motherfucker, you made me pop your fucking eye out of your  head for Pat Battle?  Pat Battle? 
[02:28:30]  That's pretty good.  Damn it.  It's still funny.  That was a good one.  All right, more news teases.  Lighting up could take more years off your life than you think.  How smoking affects your health and the economy at the same time.  What?  No shit, Sherlock.  How smoking affects your health and the economy?  Yeah.  They're even fucking with the smokers who have already decided, ah, the last ten years of  my life, who cares?  I'm going to smoke now.  But now they're saying, no, no, no. 
[02:29:00]  It could be even worse than that.  And Fourth of July and fireworks may go hand in hand around your house.  But unfortunately, so can a trip to the emergency room.  You'll see what doctors say you need to do to keep from seeing them this holiday weekend.  Doctors are going to tell you not to blow fireworks off in your hand.  Doctors are going to tell us to be smart with our fireworks.  Holy crap.  The lengths some will go through to steal puppies at 11. 
[02:29:30]  Oh my God, I saw this video.  The puppy stealing video is hysterical.  It is the cutest theft I've ever seen in my life.  It's cute and sad at the same time.  It's these masked men running into a pet store that has a really good surveillance system.  They have a lot of camera angles and everything.  And they run in, and then they switch to a camera angle that was a close-up on one of  the puppy pens, and it's this masked guy scooping up the cutest little puppies, and they all 
[02:30:00]  look like their little legs stick straight out, and their heads tilt around.  They're all confused and stuff.  Their little ears are flapping.  They're like, ooh, I'm going home.  I'm going to someone's home.  It's the most adorable crime you'll ever see.  And they probably just sold them, right?  Yeah.  Pets are expensive, little puppies.  What is he doing?  Al Roker has a big, what looks like half of a cooj ball on his head.  Yeah, it looks like a sea urchin on his head. 
[02:30:30]  It looks like he should be carrying a spear.  Oh my God.  He looked like that before.  Zulu Roker.  Am I lying?  It looks like one of those hairdos they wear out there in the jungle when they're fighting  each other.  Do they wear those hairdos in the jungle, Opie?  Well, they also wear the big stick on their cock.  I'd like to prove that, wouldn't you?  Get your name in the National Geographic with Pat Battle?  No.  Just add a rim at the end for no reason.  Let's drink to your leg.  Let's drink to Pat Battle's leg. 
[02:31:00]  Oh, by the way, we should be giving credit.  Drew in Durham, North Carolina again.  And this name, it comes up all the time, helps us all the time, but I don't know how to pronounce it.  Pat Battle.  Pam One Bus?  Pam One Bus, I guess.  Pam One Bus?  What?  It's spelled out Pam One Bus, but I'm sure it pronounces it another way. 
[02:31:30]  Jesus.  Oh, God.  God damn.  Sean from Jersey.  Hey, guys, in honor of Independence Day, we should all be singing the Pat Battle Hymn of the Republic.  I hate you all.  Russell.  Hey, yeah, I was wondering if Tom Cruise has read L. Ron Hubbard's book, Pat Battleship Earth. 
[02:32:00]  Oh, it's Battlefield Earth.  Oh, you stink.  Ugh.  Pat Battlefield.  Oh, Church of Opie checking in.  Ooh.  A very scary website, by the way.  Turtle.  Hey, I got Pat Battle of the Bulge.  Pat Battle of the Bulge.  Just said that one.  Anthony already said that one.  Come on.  See how I try to wreck the big one.  It won't happen. 
[02:32:30]  Nothing will stop me from plowing through Pat Battle Land, ever.  Nothing slows me down with Pat Battle references.  Here we go.  More news teases that are supposed to scare the shit out of us.  Tonight on ABC 7 News at 11, a recent high school graduate dies from meningitis while on a trip.  The symptoms you need to look out for.  And a scary sight would cause this ferry to plow through several boats before hitting the marina.  What symptoms do you need to look out for?  If your teenager's not moving, he's probably dead. 
[02:33:00]  Oh, that's frightening.  Plus, another Ohio company battles claims of something disgusting found in food.  Something disgusting found in food.  At least that narrowed it down.  Just a little bit.  Yeah.  I wonder what they found.  Maybe a fucking wound in the side of an apple that the intern brought you this morning.  Oh, no.  Is that possible?  Uh-oh.  What is that? 
[02:33:30]  I don't know.  My apple has the Ebola virus.  It does.  It's got a little ditch in it.  Your apple has a little Aaron Neville thing happening.  Ugh.  It's fruitish.  And it's a divot.  What's with your orange?  I don't know.  It's shaped a little odd.  I'm sure it's awful.  It's a little oddly shaped.  Like a pinhead.  More news to you.  Like a neck goiter.  Tonight at 11.  You know, I've seen more cars.  It's even a parking lot.  Cars are being stolen at an alarming rate.  And what's shocking these car thieves are.  Kids from the ages of 12 years old and up. 
[02:34:00]  Carl Monday chases down an eye-opening story.  Stop!  Stop!  More and more teens are stealing cars.  Just get in there and get out as fast as you can.  What's really fueling this car theft craze and why your ride could be next.  Let's stop, you punk!  Wow, that sounded dangerous.  And what's really shocking...  Should we still have respect for the media, you asses?  No respect for these goons.  We're out there doing a good job. 
[02:34:30]  You're not.  Jesus.  Tabloid shitheads, all of you.  They are.  They've all turned into tabloids.  This is a...  Hi, everyone.  Coming up on the morning show, it's supposed to be a little cooler on Friday.  But if your exercise program takes you outside, it could be more dangerous.  We'll have some tips so that you don't overheat.  Could be more dangerous.  Listen to how he said dangerous.  Dangerous.  Dangerous.  Make sure you get that word out there. 
[02:35:00]  Dangerous is scary.  So don't wear your ski coat when you're jogging.  The world is the scariest place in these guys' hands.  Yeah.  But Arthur Chien was just reacting like anybody else would react.  Yeah.  Fuck you.  Exactly.  Doing his rape story that we got him fired.  No, it wasn't a rape story.  Oh, which one was his?  It was a stupid subway scam.  He was in front of the subway station.  Oh, it was, right.  The MetroCard one.  It wasn't a rape story.  Who was doing the rape story that we got?  Somebody else.  Yeah.  They held their cool, though.  Yeah, that was right.  Yeah, as they should have. 
[02:35:30]  As their rape story, which I'm sure included, you know, tips on how to avoid the danger  of rape in the subway.  Yeah.  Could you be next?  Okay.  Saddam striking back all because of this picture of him in his BBBs.  What he plans to do.  Details coming up.  Striking back what he plans to do.  Well, there go another set of buildings.  I'm sure he's going to blow up some.  He's locked up tight.  He's eating Doritos in a jail cell guarded by the entire army. 
[02:36:00]  Soggy Doritos.  He likes to wet them down.  Yeah, he wets them down a little freak.  Just because we got that silly picture of him in his underpants.  Underpants.  I was trying to find the most obnoxious word.  Dirty underpants.  His underpants.  Yeah.  With his sweaty sack.  With his long taffy sack hanging down.  They're trying to scare us with Saddam Hussein stuff.  Yes, Saddam now is scary.  I want to hear this again.  Saddam striking back all because of this picture of him in his BBBs. 
[02:36:30]  What he plans to do.  Details coming up.  Here's what he's going to do.  Write a letter to Ramsey Clark, his scumbag lawyer.  That's all he can do.  That's all he can do.  He can't do anything.  Strikes back.  Ugh, Saddam strikes back.  The military implications of that one line.  Yeah.  Even though it's not the blatant danger warning thing.  No.  Because anyone in their right mind knows that he can't do anything.  They still have to make it an alarm.  It's scary. 
[02:37:00]  Something's going to happen.  He's striking back.  I think more people are alerted by something like that than thinking, ah, what could he possibly do?  Yeah, right.  Cops, tasering students, forget detention.  Next time your kid gets out of line, they could get shocked.  The controversial story coming up.  Yeah, could they?  Detention or tasered.  Those are your choices.  If your kid's screwing up at school, he's getting the taser.  I don't want my boy to be tasered. 
[02:37:30]  I don't.  I better call somebody.  You better watch this.  This audio pisses me off and makes me laugh at the same time.  It's just ridiculous.  Coming up later on this hour, what you need to know before you or your family hops out of a thrill ride,  we'll have the very latest on the dangers and how safe those rides really are.  Really are.  Thrill rides really are.  Really are.  You and your family getting on a thrill ride.  Really are.  How's my hair?  Yeah.  That's all they're worried about. 
[02:38:00]  How they look, which, if they're going to get the good, popular, fun story that everyone's going to be talking about,  informing the public, stop it.  They don't care.  It started with a current affair and shows like that that were very tabloid.  Yep.  But you know what?  They got ratings.  They got big ratings.  And all of a sudden, that became more of an attractive way to do business.  Which is fine.  But don't try to have this fake dignity in the whole thing.  Absolutely.  This fake credibility that when we hold up a sign behind you, it's an awful thing. 
[02:38:30]  Because what we're doing here is informing the public.  And you're making a mockery of, just stop it.  Say what you are.  You're a TV show like anything else that's on TV.  You're CSI News.  That's what you are.  You're an entertainment show.  And don't try to come off high and mighty when we come up behind you with a sign.  Because look at what you're doing.  Skewered facts.  It's all your show.  The assaults on the media continue. 
[02:39:00]  Oh, please.  And the best one in the month of July will win a MyFi and some other fine prizes.  That's what we do now.  A common household item now being called a possible cause of cancer.  Still ahead.  The I-Team has new information for you.  Well, how about fucking telling us now so we can throw the item out before the I-Team shows up.  Household item.  The I-Team got together, but it's a secret what we found.  Yeah.  This is cancer, lady.  Common household item.  You could say whatever the item is in that many words. 
[02:39:30]  The best one I ever heard.  Microwave oven.  The best one I ever heard was like a popular toy that your kid plays with could lead to death.  Yeah.  But they won't tell you what the toy is.  And you're like, like, like, like you're going to be able to keep your kids away from all the toys.  Away from the toys.  Don't play with it.  Until I know which toy it is.  Deadly toy.  And it's not only an item in the house.  It's a popular one.  Popular.  Always popular.  Yeah.  How about just naming the item?  Where's that one about the cancer scare?  Want that again?  Yeah.  Let me hear how she words this.  Listen to this bitch. 
[02:40:00]  Mm-hmm.  A common household item now being called a possible cause of cancer.  Still ahead.  The I-Team has new information for you.  A common household item.  Is this a fucking game show, lady?  Yeah.  It's a common household item.  Um.  Uh.  A chair.  No.  Yorley-orley-or.  Yorley-orley-or.  Remember that stupid the Swiss mountain climber game?  Yeah.  Yorley-orley-or.  I hated the mountain climber. 
[02:40:30]  Oh, I'm sorry, but you want to play Plinko?  Plinko causes cancer.  Unbelievable, the fear.  A spatula.  Eh.  Oh, I'm sorry.  That isn't a common household item that will give you cancer.  No whammies.  Wait for the I-Team.  No whammies.  No cancer, no cancer, no cancer, no cancer, and stop.  Stop on a new car.  There it is.  No cancer, big money, big money, no cancer, big money, no cancer, and stop. 
[02:41:00]  Oh, cancer.  Shit.  Oh.  Oh.  Unbelievable.  You got it?  Yeah, I got the cancer.  Is it my toilet seat?  Oh.  Damn it.  How about we give her the boot and let the I-Team do the teaser, and they could cough up the 
[02:41:30]  information they have for it.  If it's not built on ratings, how about the I-Team gives out that information?  Yeah, go ahead.  Go ahead.  Microwaves could possibly cause cancer.  This way, everyone with a microwave can watch.  Those who don't have microwaves will choose not to.  Go on there, merry way.  Merry way.  Good way to put it.  If this was about informing the people, they would inform them right then and there during  the teaser.  If it's about ratings and using fear to get people to watch, you would do the teaser, tell  people they're in danger, and then not tell them the details. 
[02:42:00]  So then you have to watch and give their program the ratings that they need.  So it's not about informing the public.  It's about the advertisers, like it is with every other entertainment venue.  All right.  Here we go.  It is a substance that's in almost everyone's kitchen, and it's now causing new concerns  about cancer.  We're going to show you what the Fox 8 Eye team has uncovered in just a couple of minutes.  It's a new...  How many words was that?  A plenty.  A powder, though?  We got a powder now, right? 
[02:42:30]  I think it was just...  Garlic salt?  Yes.  I love the garlic salt.  That bowl of asbestos I keep by my keys?  Yes, it is a bowl of asbestos.  A common item in people that have bowls of asbestos in their houses.  House.  Wait, what's the item?  What's the item?  That Michael Landon pancreas I keep in the refrigerator?  Yes, it's Michael Landon's pancreas. 
[02:43:00]  All right, we got a couple more news teases before we move on here.  I know what the item is.  What is the item?  Because we should help people out.  It's that Nancy Reagan breast lamp that I have in my kitchen.  Isn't it the Teflon or whatever on the pans or something?  Didn't he say powder?  Did he say powder?  Replay him.  Listen to how many words he uses without just saying the item.  It is a substance that's in almost everyone's kitchen and it's now causing new concerns about cancer. 
[02:43:30]  We're going to show you what the Fox 8 Eye team has uncovered in just a couple of minutes.  I officially hope the Eye team is killed in a Cessna crash.  The Eye team makes me physically ill.  I want a teamster to kill the entire Eye team.  Yeah, I would like that too.  The Eye team throws a punch like they take it in the ass.  I hate the Eye team.  Stupid Eye team.  It's kind of like the A team.  And then you need the D team and the S team.  They usually show them walking down the street all tough with their sunglasses on and their long leather coats. 
[02:44:00]  Yeah.  We're going to get things done.  Here comes the Eye team.  Yeah, I think it's Teflon or whatever they use these days on non-stick pans.  I believe that's what they were talking about.  Which has been, you know, a news story for how many years?  Ever since they came out with the Teflon, they've been talking about that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right, all right, all right, all right.  All right, all right.  Nothing, nothing, nothing.  Yeah.  We'll explain later.  News Tease, another one here.  It's the hottest new way to grill cedarwood planks.  That's wonderful. 
[02:44:30]  But it comes with a serious warning.  Should you be worried?  A Five on Your Side report gets to the truth and test food grilled on cedarwood.  Tomorrow at 5 on Live on 5.  Even the little cedar chips you get for your barbecue could fuck you up.  At least they're telling you what it is.  I'll say that.  At least they're telling you.  I like cedarwood.  I'm sure it's nothing, though, in the end.  I have cedarwood.  I like those little cedar things.  It adds to the flavor of your steak and chicken and fish.  I have a bag of cedar chips.  Cedar chips will give you kids. 
[02:45:00]  Why must you always cook with cedar chips?  And no wonder you're becoming the boy in the plastic bubble.  I don't blame you now.  I know.  Because I know you watch a lot of TV.  Dude, it's so scary out there.  One more for today and we'll rest this bit.  Oh, Opie.  Until next time.  And those infections lurking where you least expect them and why young people are most at risk.  How to protect yourself later on Medical Watch.  Infections?  Lurking?  Lurking infections? 
[02:45:30]  Where are those?  Or things that cause infections are lurking.  What?  How do you word that?  And those infections lurking where you least expect them and why young people are most at risk.  How to protect yourself later on Medical Watch.  I know what this is about.  It's about the girl, teenagers that are playing that rainbow game.  You think so?  Yeah.  Getting infections on their mouths?  Yeah, getting...  And young people get infections on their junk?  Where you least expect it. 
[02:46:00]  That's the key word, where you least expect it.  Least expect it.  That means the penis.  You'll hear infections and you'll think, I know, and you won't watch.  But if it's where you least expect it, you might go, you know what?  This is something...  I don't know where this is.  I least expect it, like, on your hair.  Yes.  An infection of the hair.  I least expect it on a piece of Gouda cheese.  Gouda.  That's where I don't expect to find a venereal infection.  So that's that.  We've got to thank Ben in Cleveland for sending in a lot of those news teases today. 
[02:46:30]  Yeah.  And we're looking for the listeners from all over the country to send in these news teases.  And we'll do this again next week when we're back on live, okay?  Thank you, Will.  Sorry.  I was just a little distracted.  I know.  We'll explain in a second.  Yeah.  On the way, we've got Pat from Minaki coming in.  He's going to be part of the Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest.  Mm-hmm.  Also, what else are we going to do today?  There's a few other things, right?  Yeah.  Exactly. 
[02:47:00]  That's a real tease.  We've got Drew Boogie in studio.  Let's just take care of this.  Good one.  Good morning, Keith.  Good morning, Keith.  At first, I actually thought I was pissing my pants.  You did. 
[02:47:30]  Thank you, Eric.  That is wonderful.  And as we did it, as Eric did it, we all watched Keith's right hand.  Yeah, make sure it didn't grab for anything.  Well, basically...  Ah, no!  Keep that away.  Well, basically, the mic wasn't on, unfortunately, so we didn't really hear the audio.  Oh, shit.  But Steve got on video for opianthony.com and foundrymusic.com.  Keith, Keith the Cop at AOL.com is in studio, and he was taking a little snooze.  That is the nap seat.  We're sick of people sleeping during our show. 
[02:48:00]  Anyone that sits there falls asleep.  Yesterday, it was Big Kev.  If you fall asleep on this program, now we mess with you.  So, basically, that's why it sounded a little weird during that bit.  We were trying to set up the bit...  Without waking him up.  Without waking him up, because he had headphones on, and basically, Steve came in with the video  camera, and Eric started pouring water on his crotch.  Now, it looks like he just took the biggest piss in his little shorts.  Because at least Keith woke up laughing, and then Eric stood there for 40 more minutes  dumping it.  I know.  He kept pouring it.  Keith, what did you think?  You thought you were pissing yourself? 
[02:48:30]  I started thinking I was taking a leak, and then all of a sudden, I heard people laughing,  and then I thought I was in that bathhouse that time, and the next thing I know...  There you go, so...  All right.  Poor Keith.  Good morning to Keith.  Give me a towel.  I'll take care of that.  We forget that it's very early when we broadcast.  Even though it's now 10, it's not that early anymore.  Keith, how's the motorcycle ride going?  The motorcycle ride is coming along very, very well.  We have a lot of interest.  Things are going well now at the club.  We've got some people going to help us along the way with the ride. 
[02:49:00]  We've got some people going to do a sticker stop down there.  We've got a t-shirt.  Yeah, but dude, just give the details.  The details.  Club Risque, July 13th.  We're going to be heading out of here at about 7.30 from the studio, asking people to come  down about 6.30.  We're going to meet out front, and riding down to Club Risque in Philadelphia.  Club's going to open probably about 9.30, 10 o'clock for us.  We're going to have breakfast, lunch sort of thing at the club.  Club, and if you don't have your sticker, get your sticker, put something on the truck  because you're complaining you haven't seen Titch yet. 
[02:49:30]  Well, yeah, it's going to be basically a wow summit.  Keith did this a few years back.  It was a huge success, so we're bringing it back.  If you want to join Keith and the gang as they drive from New York to Philly, mostly  on motorcycles, but other people are going to drive in the truck and stuff.  Yeah, caravaning and stuff.  It's going to be a little kind of a convoy from New York to Philly.  You just have to show up at the station around 6, 6.30.  Right.  What day?  It's July 13th, Wednesday, July 13th.  All right, July 13th.  That's going to be a lot of fun.  And you can email Keith at KeithTheCop at AOL.com. 
[02:50:00]  All right?  All right.  Oh, Jesus.  John in Nolens.  Hey, what's up, boys?  You know, you guys are so insensitive.  Don't you realize that Gene Sisco lost his pat battle with brain cancer?  Oh, that makes me happy.  All right.  When we get back, we'll get Pat from Monarchy in here.  But first, Drew Boogie has been spinning all morning for us live. 
[02:50:30]  Let's go to Drew and see what he's got for us.  What's that in your pants, Daddy?  Daddy, can I give you a hummer?  Daddy, can I give you a hummer?  Daddy, I love when you touch my bad plate.  Bad place.  Bad place.  Bad place.  Bad place.  Daddy.  Daddy, show me your monkey. 
[02:51:00]  Daddy, show me your monkey.  Daddy, I won't spit in my mouth.  Daddy, I won't spit in my mouth.  Daddy, what's that in a popcorn bucket?  Daddy, my poopy hurts. 
[02:51:30]  Daddy, my poopy, poopy, poopy hurts.  Anthony, do I look as young as your girlfriend?  Like sands through the hourglass, so is the old-a-day virus.  I'm the trucker.  What's up?  Yeah, this is Kyle.  Oh, hi, Kyle.  Hi, Kyle.  Our rude phone screener.  I got a message for this Pete-asshole. 
[02:52:00]  If you have such a problem with truckers, how about I come up to Montclair and kick his ass right out there, take a nice heat test and kick his ass in that.  Punch it out.  That's right, all you dumb truckers.  We love the truckers.  All you dumb truckers.  That's what you're saying.  You said that they're dumb, they call up with stupid...  What did you say about the truckers, that they're, uh...  I don't know, I'll say that.  You know, every product that you buy with your dollars has spent time on a truck.  75% of commerce would stop in this country if trucks did not get it.  That's how important the truck driver is to our great nation. 
[02:52:30]  That's right, and without truckers, by the way, incidentally, we would all be able to drive comfortably on snow without some fucking animal doing 65 right behind you.  You cocksuckers, could you understand that we're terrified in the shitty weather?  Please?  God, you make a great play, man.  Nothing but that grill with that bulldog staring you in the face in the rearview mirror.  Those fuckers barreling down on you.  You're in pea soup, you make some shit from you.  Sorry, we don't all have 80 tons fucking gluing us to the ground. 
[02:53:00]  Shitheads.  They are fearless, these guys.  They will drive by.  You know how you drive by a truck?  You don't want to hydroplane and slide into them.  These fucking animals.  There's a truck on my right.  I'm in the left lane, and the guy is right behind me.  So I have to speed up and go past the truck, and I know I'm in a hydroplane and die.  Could you have some mercy, you fucks?  O.P. and Anthony, the virus is spreading.  XM202, the O.P. and Anthony Show. 
[02:53:30]  Don't make a fucking maniac out of me.  You, you, you, you, dick.  You, you, you, dick, dick, dick, dick. 
[02:54:00]  The guys against shirts.  The guys against shirts.  Shirts, shirts, shirts, shirts.  Yeah, that's one of our favorite new things, and Drew picked up on that. 
[02:54:30]  Let's say hi to John in Virginia.  John, what's up?  What's up, boys?  How's it going?  Pretty good, bro.  I tell you, Drew Boogie is the man, and these O&A mixes are just so incredible.  I was wondering if there was any chance that he'd ever put these things out where we could  actually buy them and get them on CD or anything.  Ah, oh, uh-huh.  I'll work on that, sir.  You should just throw a little Drew Boogie remix CD together, and we'll just sell it on 
[02:55:00]  our website.  Get you some money for once.  Well, you know, I want to, you know, give the listeners a lot more than that.  You know what I mean?  So I'd have to come up with some shit.  Dude, you've been hanging with us for like four years.  You haven't made a penny yet, because you're like, it's time to move here.  Yeah, I know.  I could kind of move those invoices through a little faster.  Yeah, well.  Good point.  The best mixes, though, that you have, if you go to like eatabullet.com.  No, no, no.  There's a great CD called Trinkets I Own Made From Gorilla Hands, which has all your best  stuff on there.  So I would definitely go there and grab that if you want to hear it.  Thank you, Jim.  You're welcome, buddy. 
[02:55:30]  Hey, Pat.  Trinkets I Own Made From Pat Battle Hands.  Pat Battle Beneath the Planet Apes.  Ding, ding.  Oh.  Ow.  Here he is.  The one and only Pat from Munaki.  Better known as the car crash.  Making Munaki more famous by the day.  Do you know anybody?  Do you know any history of Munaki or anything?  Like, who's the most famous person that came out of it?  Munaki is a tribe of Indians.  Yeah, it's an Indian name? 
[02:56:00]  Yes.  You don't know what it means?  I know.  It means less than all your toes.  Anthony.  A bunch of Indians who had their funny bones removed.  I've got to call us out on something.  We claim to not do wacky radio bits.  Every once in a while we slip up because we're not perfect.  Uh-huh.  I believe Munaki was the...  The Bronco.  We did the Bash the Bronco thing.  We did?  That was in Munaki.  That was in Munaki?  I was in Munaki?  Where?  Manny's.  Manny's.  Yeah.  Manny's in Munaki.  Manny's is a great little sports bar. 
[02:56:30]  A little.  It's a huge place.  And Anthony and I, when we first came to New York, we had to get some attention any way  we could.  Yeah, we went wacky.  Oh, the papers ate it up.  We decided to bash a Bronco because, what, the Jets were playing the Broncos, I guess?  That was a big turning point for the show.  It sure was.  It kind of got us our first little blast of attention.  We thought it would be cute, but remember they pretty much, like, set the Bronco on fire.  They were animals.  Oh, yeah.  They almost rioted.  It was supposed to be a sledgehammer, and then you come up, you bash the Bronco with  the sledgehammer for a little while, and you give it to the next guy and let him do 
[02:57:00]  it.  And they wound up, yeah, it was like on fire being rolled over, rolling it over children.  Was there disco records in that Bronco?  Blow it up.  Thanks, Steve Dahl.  Jesus.  Let's go.  So, Pat, you're in Nathan's hot dog eating contest.  Why, yes, I am.  The weigh-in is happening in about a half hour, 40 minutes, right?  Well, like 1 o'clock.  Oh, 1 o'clock.  And where is it?  Where is it? 
[02:57:30]  City Hall.  City Hall.  With Mayor Bloomberg.  Mayor Bloomberg's going to be there?  I mean, slap a wow sticker on his back.  Yeah, do that.  Go, hey, buddy.  And you pat him on the back.  I guess the mayor's not too concerned about this hate crime, that he has, you know, time  to, you know, to weigh fatties.  Yeah.  Yeah.  For a hot dog eating contest.  Boy, he's really concerned about this, quote, hate crime.  This will not be tolerated in our city.  Oh, when do I have to be at the weigh-in for the hot dog eating contest?  Yuck.  That's correct. 
[02:58:00]  How do you think you'll do?  Well, I did 20 and a half at my qualifier, and I just did a test run last Monday, and I  hit the old 20 and a half wall.  So you're 20 and a half, and you can't get any more.  But I didn't prepare by not eating the day before, so maybe, I'm hoping to do, like,  maybe 25.  You didn't eat since when?  Well, last night I had a little spinach.  A little spinach.  That's all I had yesterday.  What's that?  You hungry?  Oh, yeah.  So you had a little spinach, and all I'm going to have between now and Monday, when the contest 
[02:58:30]  is, is like maybe a little scrambled egg or something like this, something easily digestible,  so it's not going to stay in there, block it up.  So I'm stunned that you're in this.  How many did you say you had?  20?  20 and a half.  20 and a half.  Now, what's the record?  Well, the record's 53 and a half, done by Takaru Kobayashi, who's going to throw out  the first pitch for the Mets game tomorrow. 
[02:59:00]  Is he?  Yes.  And I'm invited, there's a qualifier that's, the final qualifier's going to be done in  front of Shea Stadium, and they invited all the previous qualifiers to go there, and  then they, they might have us like all in a box, and, ooh, a box, and like do the old  shot of, oh, these are the fat dogs, they're going to eat the hot dogs.  Right, right, quick little shot.  Why is your right arm shiny?  Uh, well, this is my driving arm, and shiny? 
[02:59:30]  I don't know.  So he puts it out the window, and you got the, like, your left arm is tan.  The shot!  His left arm is tanned, because he has it out the window all the time.  I got to drive in England there for a while.  A little, even things out, maybe?  No?  Did you want to?  Not.  Yeah.  But that's a, boy, that's a lot of difference there, between 22 and a half and 50-some-odd.  Three, yeah.  Do you, do you think you have any chance? 
[03:00:00]  Uh, no.  Not to win, but.  Not to win.  There is an American championship, which is held by, uh, Sonia Thomas.  Uh, she does 32.  Yeah.  I, uh, I was in a contest with her down in, uh, North Wildwood.  Salty ball-eating contest.  She weighs, like, 100 pounds.  Salty ball-eating contest.  She's another Asian, right?  Yeah.  What is it with the Asians in their little stomachs?  I don't know.  Well, she's American.  She's, uh, originally of North Korean descent, or Korean.  She had six pounds of potatoes in, like, eight minutes, and I had, like, four, a little over 
[03:00:30]  four pounds.  Six pounds of anything.  They should make her do that while they're beating her for Falun Gong practice.  Irritating.  Is she stuffed?  I don't know.  The expression hasn't changed.  She doesn't look full.  You know she's done eating when she just keels over and vomits.  There's no noise, no nothing.  Just head-toking over.  After that contest, she was popping the potatoes in her mouth after the contest.  I'm stuffed, ready to blow, and she's still popping them in her mouth. 
[03:01:00]  Still eating.  Wow.  Do they puke, these people, after these?  No, some people do.  I know there was people that were going from one qualifier.  If they didn't win one qualifier, they'd go to the next one to try and win that one,  and they...  They would puke it up and start from scratch.  Oh, my God, really?  Yeah.  What's the prize?  Cleared out.  Well, the qualifier is you get to go to Coney Island.  Yeah.  And Coney Island, it's more prestigious than a prize.  Of course, the prestige.  You get the yellow mustard belt, you win, which is now in Nagano, Japan, where Kobayashi's from. 
[03:01:30]  Hopefully the yellow mustard belt fits a neck properly.  And you hope it would be your dream to bring that home to the United States proudly to be displayed here in the United States.  It ain't happening.  Hey, Pat.  I don't know.  I have a little faith in Pat from Monaki.  What happens when...  Do you time yourself?  Is it a timed event?  Yeah, it's a 12-minute contest. 
[03:02:00]  12 minutes.  So what you did when you practiced is you set something for 12 minutes, and you start eating, and you see.  And what is it that...  Why is it that you can't get more than 22 and a half feet?  Well, I believe I have the capacity, because like a couple minutes later, you get a second wind.  You just don't know how to get him into you fast enough.  Yeah.  And there's definitely a mental block when you're trying to eat hot dogs, because you could have...  Your throat's clear, and you could have a mouthful of hot dogs, and your brain's just telling you not to swallow, because you're full. 
[03:02:30]  Wow.  You might be swallowing a lot of aggression.  Yeah.  Along with a lot of pizzas.  What is...  I'm not going to open that Pat from Monaki and have all those hot dogs spill all over the dock.  Pat, please don't encourage that.  I can't for her.  That's very funny.  A lot of people are saying, don't starve, your stomach will shrink.  Another guy's saying you should eat a lot in the next three days.  Well, I will have like a gallon of water at night, just to keep it stretchy. 
[03:03:00]  Right.  My question is, you know how funny, because do you think you're going to win realistically?  No.  No.  He doesn't even have a shot.  Do you know what would be funny?  If he just got one hot dog down in 12 minutes.  Oh, I'm stuffed.  Or just ate like real slow, like lounging with a bun.  With a bun on it, yeah, just kind of.  Now, are there buns?  Yes.  Oh, eat hot dogs?  You don't have to eat it all together, but you have to eat the hot dogs and the buns.  But I've seen this.  A lot of people soak the buns in water.  Yes.  Well, that's what I learned from my first contest.  I only did 15, but I noticed they were dunking the buns. 
[03:03:30]  That's so gross.  They dunk the buns in the water.  Yeah, it turns into like wet cotton.  Mush.  Then you eat the wet bun, and then they shove the hot dog in their face.  Swallow that.  Yeah.  And then more wet bun.  How much water do you get?  They can get 232.  Yeah, you can get more, but they start out with 232-ounce cups of water.  Do you, um, how do you warm up to this?  I hope it's not water from today.  Is there a, start getting, start getting, isn't there some, isn't there some strange rules 
[03:04:00]  when it comes to these, uh, eating contests?  Or somebody was telling me, what was it?  Yeah, there's all kinds of regulations.  I have something here from the International Federation of Competitive Eating, uh, addressed  to Mr. Philbin.  Ooh.  Yes.  Congratulations on your win in Philadelphia and your entry into the Nathan's famous 4th  of July International Hot Dog Eating Contest.  We look forward to your participation in this event.  In close, find the waiver you must sign.  What type of waiver is that?  Uh, just that they could use my, uh, wonderful image. 
[03:04:30]  Uh, here's some of the waiver.  I understand the health and associated risk inherent in eating contests and in the consumption  of large quantities of food and calories over both short and extended periods of time.  I certify that I am in good health.  How did you certify that?  You're missing a toe to diabetes and you're like a goddamn walrus.  Yeah.  And you have rosacea.  I've consulted with, uh, qualified persons in the medical profession.  Have you?  Uh, yeah.  And obtained clearance from me to participate in this contest, uh, and similar eating contests. 
[03:05:00]  And then it says, uh, also I will not compete in a hot dog eating contest sponsored by, uh,  or organized by any other party other than Nathan's famous for 366 days.  It's from the completion of the Nathan's contest on the 4th of July.  They don't want to.  366.  That means you can't do it the next 4th of July anywhere else.  Right.  On a leap year.  You have a no compete in eating.  Yes, that's correct.  No comp-eat.  Yeah.  Get it?  No?  Comp-eat.  Didn't pay for it. 
[03:05:30]  Uh, here it is.  The IFOCE eaters who stand among history's finest athletes, it says that, and who are  truly deserving of the media attention they receive are critical to the sport and to the  entertainment enjoyed by fans worldwide.  They are role models and spokespeople for an entire sport.  Yeah, the real role models.  Eat until you throw up.  That's really a positive message to give children.  Uh, IFOCE members are more than simply competitors, athletes, and rivals. 
[03:06:00]  They are a group of friends and associates who have distinguished themselves as leaders  in their communities.  Hmm.  I command respect.  Meh.  Code of conduct.  Eat for the love of the game.  Don't do this for a prize, I guess.  I've been doing that my whole life.  Yeah.  Be generous and cordial in victory and demonstrate grace in defeat.  Defeat has only nine toes.  When traveling to an event or spending time in a location for the purpose of competing 
[03:06:30]  in a contest or an IFOCE-related activity, conduct yourself with honor and dignity, obeying  the laws of the land and our culture.  Dignity is a relative term.  Yeah, dignity.  Look at what you're doing.  You're sitting there shoving food in your face.  There is pages and pages of little, uh, rules and regulations.  How do you warm up for this?  Do you go, like, around the city and just hit buddy booths?  No.  Only if the guy's named Nathan. 
[03:07:00]  And this is, um, your info.  Uh, 6'2", 325 pounds.  And then he puts in parentheses, I weigh a lot less on the moon.  You sent this to them?  Yeah, they asked me for a little info.  I gave him a little extra.  Do you know what makes me want to just drive my elbow into your gum line?  Ooh.  The fact that after you put your little jokes, you put an exclamation point.  Oh, everything exclaims.  I'm excited about everything. 
[03:07:30]  The death knell of comedy writing is the exclamation point.  I only use exclamation points when I'm writing a letter like, uh, last night I had to get on the Dell chat because I ordered a fan and it's taking three friggin' weeks to get there and still no delivery date in sight.  And I get on this chat thing because you can't get a live human being on the phone.  And, uh, they're Indian.  Oh, I know.  So you're chatting.  It's every customer service thing is India.  And they tell, well, Mr. Kumia, we are so sorry that this, uh, happened.  And I typed in huge letters, you and the last six people I chatted to about this. 
[03:08:00]  And, dude, it was, uh, I can't even count how many exclamation points I could measure.  It was about five or six inches of exclamation point across the page.  I was exclaiming this.  You have lots of fans, Anthony.  Oh, thank you, Pat.  There you go.  Oh, jeez.  Age 41.  I'm just a couple of years from my IQ score.  Exclamation point.  Because that means I will a couple years, I'm a couple years from my IQ score. 
[03:08:30]  That's how you're delivering that.  Right.  Oh.  Oh, I weigh a lot less on the moon.  Interesting facts he's got about himself.  I'm an occasional guest on the Opie and Anthony show on XM Satellite Radio.  Oh, thank you, Pat.  Good, good to put a comma after XM.  I don't think I'm going to put that in the official.  What do I do, you ask?  I bring mirth and hilarity to the show.  And he puts mirth and hilarity in, uh, quotations.  Yes.  And, of course, an exclamation point at the end of that.  I'm referred to as Pat from Munaki because my name is Pat. 
[03:09:00]  And, well, dot, dot, dot, from Munaki.  That's a town in New Jersey.  Also, I'm on what I call the competitive eating diet.  It involves having one healthy meal a day with lots of water to increase stomach capacity.  And the rest of the day, I save it for the contest.  LOL.  Whether there is a contest or not.  Whether there is a contest or not.  Hobbies. 
[03:09:30]  I have three cats, stinky, smelly, and precious, from Silence of the Lambs.  You have three cats?  Yes, I do.  You're a crazy cat guy.  By the way, he has about 30 different words that have fucking quotes around them.  Quotation.  Around everything.  I'm an occasional guest on the, quote, Obie and Anthony show, unquote.  While I bring, quote, mirth, unquote, and, quote, hilarity, unquote.  I'm referred to as, quote, Pat from Munaki, unquote, because my name is, quote, Pat, unquote.  And I'm, well, dot, dot, dot, quote, from Munaki, unquote. 
[03:10:00]  Sorry if you're not happy with my writing.  Also, I'm on the, quote, the competitive eating diet, unquote.  It involves having one, quote, healthy, unquote, meal a day.  I have three cats, quote, stinky, unquote.  Hey, Jim, fuck you.  I, quote, save it, unquote.  Three cats, quote, stinky, unquote, quote, smelly, unquote.  He's doing the visual sign of quotes.  He is.  And, quote, precious, unquote.  I have, he has one dog, a yellow lab named, quote, Joey, unquote. 
[03:10:30]  I enjoy movies and television, lifting weights.  What?  Left leg, right leg.  Well, I haven't touched him in a couple of years.  One leg's lighter than the other, remember.  Master Poe is training me to kill, I'll have you know.  Oh, he is?  Yes.  He trains everybody to kill.  Yeah.  Bike riding?  I'm going to throw my toes like a Chinese star.  Hold on.  How is he training you to kill?  Well, when his school opens up, he's going to, uh, I'm going to lose weight. 
[03:11:00]  Well, I'm going to lose weight up until then.  But then I'll be ready to learn how to kill.  Well, I hope it has all the success of the blind school and Little House on the Prairie.  I'll be Master Toe.  That's funny.  Oh!  Master Toe.  Is the weigh-in going to be on TV?  A lot of people are asking.  We heard it's going to be on ESPN, possibly.  It's usually, it's, no, it's usually, uh, it might be on ESPN, but it's usually, they  tape it and it usually ends up on the evening news programs. 
[03:11:30]  Ah.  Okay, okay.  Is this freak in your neighborhood?  Uh, occupation.  I'm presently a courier.  But one day I hope to be the driver of the, uh, quote, of the official XMOP and Anthony van.  There you go.  Unquote.  But it's got to be the, quote, the official XMOP, Anthony van!  Unquote.  I'm excited.  Spouse, none, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot. 
[03:12:00]  That's right, ladies.  He's available.  The line forms to the left.  The line forms to the left!  Smiley face, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot.  Dot, dot, dot, dot.  Okay, dot, dot, dot, dot.  I'm lonely.  I'm a lonely, lonely man.  Sad face.  I'm a lonely, lonely man.  Man!  What's your name, dot?  Uh-huh.  Favorite quote, I swallow a lot of aggression.  Dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot. 
[03:12:30]  Along with a lot of pizzas.  No.  You missed the dot there.  It's favorite quote, quote, I swallow a lot of aggression.  Right.  Along with a lot of pizzas!  Of course, the exclamation point on everything.  Uh, comment, I was, uh, on the, oh, yeah, quote, of course, I was on the wrestling team  in high school.  I was a district champ, and these, quote, eating contests, unquote, are just as fiercely  competitive! 
[03:13:00]  Unquote.  Pat from Manic Aki.  Oh!  You actually, here's what you're supposed to do, sweetie.  When you have, um, quotes, and you have to put quotes inside, it's supposed to be a single  quote inside.  Oh, okay.  And then, there's a little side thing in, in, uh, parentheses, here, in, uh, brackets,  whatever you want to call them.  Nancy, I guess that's somebody you have to deal with over there?  Yes.  I hope it's useful, semi-colon, you can edit it down as much as you like! 
[03:13:30]  Why did you put an exclamation point there on instructing her that you hope it's useful,  you can edit down as much as you like?  I was excited.  Oh, that's fantastic.  Very good.  You are the greatest.  Um, how to win a hot dog eating contest.  Oh, what, what, what do you got, Pat?  What?  What'd you say?  Oh, you were trying to say something.  Oh, no, he, he said I'm the greatest, and I said, what am I, Alice?  Oh, you are the greatest.  You're shaped like the moon, Alice, whatever. 
[03:14:00]  Uh, there are ways to win eating hot dog contests.  Have you read this?  Standard tactics, skip a meal or two, just eat as many of them as you can.  Try to stay away from water, as it'll fill you up faster, but you'll probably need some,  uh, to close, uh, close to the end anyway.  Most hot dogs have a notoriously high sodium content, and plus the water will help you swallow  when you're really full.  The dunk tactic.  I never understood this one, but I've seen it used.  The, uh, they dunk the hot dog in water before eating it. 
[03:14:30]  I'm guessing the water will lubricate the hot dog and help it go down, but I've always  got the extra water, as stated above, fill you up faster.  And then there's the Japanese tactic.  This way was first popularized by the Japanese, who won a few of the contests, uh, in a way,  despite being smaller, in this way, despite being small than their American competitors.  They would separate the meat part of the hot dog from the bun, then they'd eat the  meat and smash the bun into a tiny wad and eat it separately.  This technique seems smart, because it would eliminate most of the air that's trapped in 
[03:15:00]  the bread.  Considering that the hot dog bun can be smashed into something small, it seems like a technique  that would free up a lot of volume in the stomach.  Ugh.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, did that help a little?  Yeah.  Squish those buns?  Yeah, I'm learning.  All right.  Very excited for Pat from Munaki.  Oh, yeah.  Very good, Pat.  Good luck to you.  Jimmy, drive in the HIV lane?  Ha-ha.  Never mind. 
[03:15:30]  A little out of context there.  Oh, good Lord.  Oh.  All right, Pat.  Good luck to you.  All righty.  Represent us.  Be proud.  Yep.  And this little piggy went, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.  All the way to the biohazard dumpster.  Good luck, Pat.  When's the contest, Sunday?  Breaking news.  Monday.  The 4th of July contest?  Justice O'Connor retires.

Well, she's a liberal.  Pat.  Could be a problem.  Oh, wow.  Oh, did you spin him around with that one?  Yeah, well, he spun around on the tallest foot, so it was very quick.  And him spinning makes a lot of gravity, Jim, so suck you right into him.  All right, Anthony, the weekend almost upon us anyway, and people are going to be looking 
[03:16:30]  for, what is that?  What is that?  Oh, that is so annoying.  Wow.  You're like bending Liddy with a rubber band around his mouth.  Oh, is that annoying as hell?

But we won't.  All right, we should clean up some business here.  We talked about the Spidey Rapist guy. 
[03:25:30]  Spider-Man Rapist.  Spidey Rapist.  Spidey Rapist.  They caught him.  Mm-hmm.  And he didn't look like Spider-Man.  No.  The post made it look like he looked like Spider-Man.  Well, what comes out of his web, too, will lower your life sentence.  All right.  You know, that's not a bad bit, either.  That's not a bad idea.  The jokes that we've blown?  Yeah, Friday, we just replay the top five bombs of the week.  Bombs of the week.  Well, dude, I would love to hear that as a long bit.  Like, if someone could find a lot of them over, like, the last couple of months and put them in some of our joke bombs. 
[03:26:00]  That's not a bad idea.  Dude, what a great bit that would be.  That would be hilarious.  A lot of work for some of the young gentlemen in that room.  I'd feel bad that none of my stuff would make it, but, I mean, it would still be fun.  Absolutely.  That would be a great montage.  What's this?  How embarrassing.  Why are you handing this to me?  I just have to give it back to you.  I had to take it for a second.  All of our awful joke bombs and mistaken words.  Yeah.  Screw-ups.  Perfect.  That would be good.  All right.  Bombs of the week or something like that.  Yeah.  Of the week of the...  How do you spell the... 
[03:26:30]  What?  Okay.  All right.  So they got the Spidey rapist, Ant.  Yeah.  And he had a big, ridiculous mustache.  It looks like he's got one of those Leroy Neiman mustaches.  Right.  Big thing.  Only, yeah, it's on a black guy, which kind of looked really weird.  Looks like he raped Raleigh Finger's face.  Nothing like Peter Parker, that's for sure.  So we're done with the Spidey rapist.  He's done.  You're safe again, people. 
[03:27:00]  Also, Anthony, we did the hoodlums stealing puppies.  Bruce Kelly calling in from London.  He didn't do that today.  Thanks, Bruce.  Yeah, for nothing.  And then he wonders why we mess with him.  Absolutely.  Bruce was supposed to, quote, call, unquote.  He's unreliable.  And we made a jingle and everything.  I want to at least play the jingle again, because the guys worked hard on it.  Bruce Kelly's on the phone from far away, and we bet he's got nothing good to say.  This segment could be the world's biggest threat.  Bruce Kelly's got his pants around his neck. 
[03:27:30]  Let's all make a bet that Bruce Kelly will get hung up on again.  See, that would have been great.  And then it would have been, hey, Bruce.  Hey, Bruce.  What's going on?  How you doing?  What's up with that Live 8?  Yeah, Live 8.  Where does Steve sing these songs?  In the studio?  If I ever walk in and see him belting out a tune, I'm going to grab his back fat with  a pair of, like, garden shears and just pinch it.  No.  Oh, look at the big bear who just came in and hugged Jimmy. 
[03:28:00]  You know he's like, you know he's shaking his hips from side to side as he sings.  Do you think he's doing that?  I picture him snapping his fingers.  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  Eyes closed.  I do.  Could you show us how you sing that?  How good do you do?  Wah, wah.  How do I, generally, I have to sit there and I have to listen to a bunch of music first.  It's all instrumental stuff and I have to look at what I've got written down and see  which track will fit.  So I'll just sit and I'll, you know, and I'll go, I'll try to work out the rhyme scheme  and generally there is a boogie that ensues after.  How about that song? 
[03:28:30]  How would you sing that?  Are you wiggling your ass a little bit?  No, it's not because I'm sitting down.  I'm sitting down.  You're sitting when you sing?  Oh, yeah.  It's difficult.  Yeah, it is, but I'm not really, you know, stretching.  That's pretty much within my range.  So, you know, you're just sitting.  Oh, my God.  He's dancing.  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  Let's hear something.  What?  Let's hear it.  I want to hear some of that song.  You just, no, no.  Yeah, let's hear it.  I want the...  The acapella?  Yeah, let's go.  Hold on.  I want Steve Marchini, Steve Unplugged.  Can you play it one time?  Because I forgot what the words were. 
[03:29:00]  I'll play it a little.  Oh, no.  We can't play it.  All right.  Fine.  All right.  I'll play it.  Jesus.  Bruce Kelly's on the phone from far away, and we bet he's got nothing good to say.  This segment could be the world's biggest wreck.  Bruce Kelly's got his pants around his neck.  Let's all make a bet that Bruce Kelly will get hung up on again.  Bruce Kelly's on the phone from far away. 
[03:29:30]  Will Betty...  What?  Let's bet you can get tickets for Jim's Cleveland show today.  That's right.  Motherfucker.  Don't encourage him, Steve.  You are the worst.  Just let it go.  Was that all that was?  That was just a build-up so you could...  No, I didn't know you were going to forget there.  I rhyme anything with the Odeon.  Don't acknowledge he's doing it, and we get to move on.  Don't encourage him.  I had the first...  Okay. 
[03:30:00]  Pat battles on the phone today.  All right.  We get the point, Steve.  Yeah, thank you.  You look very gay when you're singing.  That's what you're doing.  Awful.  I know.  All right.  Sounds good, though.  Thank you.  Oh, we didn't get to the parachuting pilot.  I didn't know you could do this in the year 2005.  Small plane.  Crashed in Rockland County.  In a pond up there, I guess.  Yeah, and the pilot walked away. 
[03:30:30]  The pilot suffered leg pains.  That was it.  Leg pains.  That's a little odd.  He's got leg pains, and he can't work his rudder controls, I guess.  But you could still kind of...  I don't understand why his leg pain made his plane crash.  I think this guy just wanted to try out that parachute.  And the plane was getting old.  Yeah, the plane's maybe a little older.  I don't know.  You might be onto something, because he saw the pond.  You buy this thing. 
[03:31:00]  Wasn't it going to hurt anybody?  Yeah, you buy these things.  They're big parachutes.  And they go in the middle section of your wing on one of these above the cockpit planes,  like a Cessna.  The wings that go above your cockpit.  Wait a minute.  And there's a hatch in there.  Yeah.  I know what he means.  I thought the parachute was on him.  No.  The plane?  It's on the plane.  The parachute is on the plane itself.  It comes out of the middle of the wings.  Okay.  And obviously you can't do it when you're ripping at full speed, but if you have engine 
[03:31:30]  failure and you slow your plane up enough, you can pop the chute.  And this parachute comes down, and the plane comes down real slow, and he jumped out right  before it hit the ground, or it hit in the water.  He, like, jumped, kind of dove out, and it was fine.  It was absolutely fine.  And the plane slowly came down into the lake.  Wow.  Yeah.  So a lot of people are getting these. 
[03:32:00]  A lot of executives are getting them in their small planes.  I wonder if, um...  What's his name?  Our own, uh...  Oh, they're at XM.  Oh, uh...  Lee.  Lee Abrams.  Lee Abrams.  I wonder if our own Lee Abrams has that in there.  He just...  Smokes a little too much weed.  He hits the chute instead of, you know, the throttle.  He doesn't care about safety.  He's smoking pot up there.  But that's what this guy did.  He had a little leg pain and pulled the chute.  Yeah.  But I think it's one of those things that you don't know if it's going to work until you  use it, and it costs you a lot of money, and you're like, I'm going to see if this thing 
[03:32:30]  works.  Leg pain?  That's pretty wild, though.  You can land your plane without your legs.  You really can't.  That's what the wheels are for.  And, uh...  Yeah, you don't need...  It's a Flintstones plane.  Sticks his legs out the bottom.  It'll be a little rough, especially if it's windy or something like that.  And then you might have a problem applying the brakes once you get down.  But, you know, you don't need it to maneuver up there, really.  Right.  So leg pain's a little odd thing to crash your plane over.  All right. 
[03:33:00]  We didn't even talk about the Howard Beach thing, huh?  Ah.  What, are we going to end on a light note?  On that comedy story?  Oh, I thought you were going to talk about this.  This is an interesting story, too.  I write with the army picture.  He looks like Denzel in glory.  The Freedom Tower looks suspiciously like the design by famed architect Stern.  Ooh, get ripping me off again.  Tell him, Fred.  I designed that building.  That was my first studio.  You ever hear from the top of the Howard Stern building? 
[03:33:30]  That's it.  I invented it.  What a tool.  And the Daily News has the Howard Beach Shocker.  Second time at bat.  Get it?  Because he caved his head in with a bat.  Oh, cool.  Records reveal race attack suspects' previous arrests.  This guy got in some previous trouble.  A little previous trouble.  It seems after the September 11th attacks, he was arrested for assaulting a Sikh man in Queens and clubbing them and shooting them with paintball guns. 
[03:34:00]  So they're just trying to go about their lives, and he's across the street with a paintball gun just shooting at them?  Yeah.  During the beating, Minucci allegedly screamed,  Fucking Arab, why don't you blow this up?  This was wild.  I'm sure he grabbed his cock when he said that, too.  Hey, you fucking Arab, why don't you blow this up, eh?  Come here.  He did this while the buildings were still burning. 
[03:34:30]  No, it was that too, was it?  Or no?  One of the stories I read, you know, the buildings were still burning, and he went out, and he was so pissed off.  And one of them clubbed him while the Twin Towers burned, the sources said.  So as it was happening, he just found some poor bastard with a turban, not knowing that the Sikhs have nothing to do with anything.  But no one knew that at the time.  No one knew what they were about.  They just looked like Arabs.  Right.  Towel heads.  And then we finally got educated to realize that they had nothing to do with that, right? 
[03:35:00]  Yeah.  I don't think, no.  Sikhs are fine.  He also stabbed a 16-year-old neighbor a few years back, a high school rivalry or something.  So he had that going for him.  And he's friends.  Yeah, but you didn't explain that story further.  He knifes this kid in the neighborhood, right?  Mm-hmm.  And then the kid's going to testify or whatever, but he can't because he died.  Yeah.  He was on a subway platform and just happened to...  Yeah.  It's a little odd.  And just happened to jump onto the tracks, I guess. 
[03:35:30]  Yeah, he fell.  He fell onto the tracks.  Wow.  Nicholas Fat Nick Minucci is his name.  Hard to be a lawyer with that nickname.  Yeah.  He's a stocky suspect known as Fat Nick.  Sold a bread delivery route his family had given him for $80,000.  He's unemployed, drives a $60,000 Cadillac Escalade, has a $6,000 Rolex, and wears a $4,000 gold chain. 
[03:36:00]  He's 19.  He's 19.  His mother is on disability.  He, uh, is friends with the, uh, Gotti kids, and has appeared on the Growing Up Gotti TV show.  Hmm.  Yeah.  They are making, they are really going to nail this guy, too, because he's on the front page of our paper.  It's like you're finished. 
[03:36:30]  Yeah.  Well, Reverend Al has shown his face on this one, also.  Reverend Al.  He's, uh, they're standing side by side with the, uh, the mother of one of the guys that was, was beaten.  The guy that was beaten over the head with the baseball bat.  Of course, he's got to get right out there, looking very angered by this whole thing.  And I guess a lot of what he's saying is, uh, hey, this isn't about what anyone was there to do,  or any crimes that may have been tried to be committed, and this, that, the, it's about the beating of another human being. 
[03:37:00]  Why is, why is it not about what they were there to do?  Asshole.  Um.  Why?  Because it was a white guy that beat up a black guy.  All right.  That's logical.  Now it makes sense.  And, uh, two of the, two of the other black guys, one of, because one black guy got beat up, the other two ran away.  Uh, one of the other guys is saying, why can't we, you know, it's, it's not the 50s or 60s, why can't we, uh, walk in any neighborhood we want? 
[03:37:30]  That's right.  Because you can't.  Because we can't.  Because no one, there are certain people that just can't go into other people's neighborhoods.  That's just the way it is.  It's an awful thing.  Sorry.  Sorry we don't live in this, uh, paradise where we can all walk around.  They were there to steal.  They weren't just walking through the neighborhood.  Right.  There, there really isn't enough emphasis being put on that.  Holy shit is this aggravating.  This mook, uh, beating, uh, this guy over the head with a bat is, is a moron. 
[03:38:00]  But the fact of the matter is, these guys are in there robbing, they were there to steal, to steal.  You got what you had coming to you.  Too bad.  And when you're doing, when you're committing crimes, what happens to you is, oh well, your responsibility.  It happens.  How about if somebody breaks into your home and you shoot them, uh, but you yell something  racist, is that also a hate crime?  I, it probably would be, yeah.  And I realize that these guys are not in the middle of the crime, but you understand the 
[03:38:30]  point.  They were there to commit a crime.  Mm-hmm.  Ugh.  And they found them with all kinds of tools on them, which the mother said, uh, her son  was carrying these tools to hang a pair of Air Jordans on his wall at home.  So we needed a hammer and a screwdriver and, uh, various other tool, implements to hang  sneakers up on the wall.  Well, when I first heard he had the tools, I thought there couldn't be a rational explanation.  And then when you hear that, you're like, ah.  Ah.  Now I get it.  Attaboy.  Now I get it. 
[03:39:00]  These fuckers are really screwing it up for me.  Why?  I was screwing it up for you there.  Yeah.  You're black, Drew?  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm not buying that one fully either.  I don't know.  Newsflash.  You're the fake black guy.  No, he's very musical.  I had a black guy in high school that was like Drew.  I think you got a little blood in you, but I think Massa was making a few trips out to  the house way back when.  Oh, yeah.  You know?  And you got, what color are your eyes?  Hazel.  They're like hazel.  Yeah.  Very light.  Very attractive.  You have blonde hair. 
[03:39:30]  Thank you, man.  Blonde hair, blue eyes.  You call me daddy.  Your name isn't really Drew Boogie.  That's right.  It's Ishmael Schmidt.  Yeah.  Fred Eichmann.  I think the white blood in the black broad's cutin' him up a little bit.  Wait a minute.  Whatever happened to you like in the dark, Wesley Snipes?  No, let me tell you something.  You get a black guy. 
[03:40:00]  I mean, how pissed are they, really?  Do you want to look like the mother from Good Times or Halle Berry, man?  You get a little white blood in you.  Dude, you get a black guy and a white chick go together, and they don't even have to be  attractive, black guy and white chick.  They make great babies.  They make supermodels.  They breed supermodels.  They give you a nice, beautiful, conglomerated, mulatta, mongrel class of baby.  Am I wrong, Drew?  The white blood helps you guys out a little bit. 
[03:40:30]  They come out supermodels all the time.  Cuteness.  Those are the ones I seek out.  How that works.  Black and Asians make very, very, black and Asians a very cool combination.  Yeah, but they come out flat-chested and no ass.  Yeah, that's true.  You need the ass.  Well, the black might add the ass.  It depends on what trait.  Not the ones I think, yeah.  Because, like I was saying, there's a bigger muscle that rides higher up in the buttocks,  and that makes them the better athlete.  You want to get the best qualities of both races.  You know, when they bred them back then, they bred the big black buck with the... 
[03:41:00]  Do you think that cameraman was just going, oh, my God, I am filming Jimmy the Greek's death  right here?  Keep talking, Jimmy.  Jimmy's got a scotch on the rocks in front of him, and he's just going on and on about  how the slave owners used to breed the black buck to be strong, and that's how we got  the better athlete today.  Do we have that on tape?  It was just over.  Why don't we have that?  We've got to find that one.  Try to find that.  You know something?  I haven't come across that over the years, and that is one of those clips that is just 
[03:41:30]  like the cameraman's just, are you getting this?  Like the news guy, just look at the camera.  Are you getting this?  Oh, my God.  This is the end of Jimmy the Greek right here.  What year was that, like 85 or something?  Yeah.  Yeah, and then he just faded away completely and then dropped dead.  Get something your boy Sid said.  It's not too far off.  Yeah.  Yeah, right?  All right, so that's it with the Howard Beach?  Now it's just Sid.  That's about it for the Howard Beach for now?  Yeah, well, this guy's pretty much done.  And the other guy, the mysterious guy Frankie, remember him, the associate? 
[03:42:00]  Yeah.  Turns out he's an NYPD detective's son and was really rushed out of one of the precincts  yesterday in a car.  They showed the clip.  They opened the car door.  He ran out with something over his head, jumped into the back seat, which had the seats folded  down with an opening to the trunk, rolled into the trunk, and then his father came and  flipped the seats up, and the car sped off.  Why did he roll in the trunk?  So the press couldn't get any shots of him inside the car. 
[03:42:30]  It was amazing.  This father's protecting the shit out of this kid.  And this kid's in deep trouble when he gets home.  Oh, can you imagine?  He's probably thinking, please, could you keep me in jail?  Because my father is going to kill me.  Jail would be a pleasure at this point.  Hey, we only have a minute left in the show.  You know that guy, Keith?  Which one?  The father of the air?  No, I don't.  No, you know.  I want to get Drew Boogie on the air for one more minute, because we have one last minute  in the show.  Let her rip.  So, Anthony and Joey, Atlantic City.  Thank you.  We'll see you all on Wednesday.  Send material in by July 7th for the cover band competition we're doing. 
[03:43:00]  July 8th, we picked the finalists.  Are you insane?  Info is up in the events section on openanthony.com.  Looking for all cover bands to send in their stuff.  Drew Boogie, thanks for helping us out today.  We greatly appreciate it.  Sure, absolutely.  We will end with Drew Boogie today.  Let's go.  We will end with Drew Boogie. 
[03:43:30]  Oh, and A. 
[03:44:00]  Oh, and A.  Program complete.  The ad, the bullshit's over with.  All right, let's pair that up.  I gotta get out of here and suck a dick.  Oh, wait, we're still on.  Sorry.  I thought the mic were off. </pre>
