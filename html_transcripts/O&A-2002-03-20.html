<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a segment heavily focused on sexually explicit content.  The hosts, Opie and Anthony, shared their own childhood sexual experiences and played listener-submitted audio clips detailing underage sexual activity, including clips of young girls discussing oral sex.  Callers contributed their own sexually explicit anecdotes, with one expressing concern about the implications for his three-month-old daughter.  The discussion then took a dark turn, pivoting to rumors and anecdotes about alleged deaths and cover-ups at Disney theme parks.

The show then transitioned to an in-studio interview with musician Rick James.  The interview delved into James's legal troubles, extensive drug use (including freebasing cocaine), time in Folsom prison, relationships with women (mentioning Linda Blair), and his views on contemporary music.  The conversation was peppered with sexually suggestive and offensive remarks from both the hosts and James.  Further discussion about Rick James and his drug use (including freebasing crack with acid) continued after the interview, including a caller claiming another caller, Malik, lost his virginity while listening to a Rick James song.  Malik then called in, engaging in playful, drug-related banter with the hosts.

The show then abruptly shifted to a humorous, albeit false, rumor about the US Army mistaking Asbury Park for Afghanistan.  This was followed by a discussion about Mike Tyson, his perceived instability, and his upcoming fight with Andrew Golota.  Surprisingly, Mike Tyson himself called into the show, discussing his own Zoloft use, recounting bizarre anecdotes about being tranquilized and tracked by wildlife researchers, and making offensive comments.

Next, the hosts launched into a satirical discussion of newly released Richard Nixon tapes. They mimicked Nixon's voice and mannerisms, focusing on his paranoia, racism, anti-semitism, and willingness to consider using nuclear weapons in Vietnam.  The hosts used numerous offensive terms and recounted Nixon's views on women, his alleged alteration of a photo depicting the napalming of a Vietnamese village, and his general bigotry.

The broadcast culminated in a studio game called "Feels for Meals," featuring a blindfolded, topless woman in a box whose breasts were touched by several men, including her brother.  The brother's participation was incentivized with Jim Brewer concert tickets and a meet-and-greet.  This segment was rife with sexually suggestive and offensive conversations about the participants.  Multiple callers phoned in to express outrage and disgust.  Reverend Al Sharpton briefly appeared, expressing his anger at the segment and also commenting on unrelated issues of race and taxi service discrimination.  The show concluded with promotion of upcoming segments and events.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Parkinson's disease may have reduced his bellow to a whisper, but Muhammad Ali's mouth can still get him in trouble.  The 59-year-old former heavyweight champ stunned a gathering in Washington when he let loose with jokes guaranteed to offend just about everybody.  Oh, equal opportunity offender.  This was an actual joke that Ali said to a crowded room.  This guy, you know, let's do it as Ali because I won't be able to do it.  Well, the funniest part is he can get away with anything. 
[00:00:30]  He's so pathetic now.  They had the premiere for his big movie there.  Ali.  With, who's playing him?  Will Smith.  Will Smith.  And there's Muhammad Ali walking into the movie there, and they're all like, Ali, Ali, paparazzi, give us a pose.  I saw a guy turn around and start laughing his ass off like he looked at Ali and then had to turn around because he was laughing.  Because Ali's trying to make it look like a boxer.  Still holding his hands up in his ass. 
[00:01:00]  I can't.  Eek.  Oh, I'll get you.  Coach, I'll float like a high beam.  I sting like a cotton ball.  And he's got his arms, he can't even hold them steady.  And this guy, this little munchkin guy walking him around, it's sad because the guy used to be, I'll go, oh, I'll go get you, Joe Frazier.  I'll get you, Joe Frazier.  And now, Joe who?  You know his brain is still there, though. 
[00:01:30]  Oh, is it?  Yeah.  He just can't communicate what he's thinking.  I still believe it's from the decon fog on pesticides.  So he's in a crowded room in Washington and he decides to tell a couple jokes.  Here's his first joke.  This is the God's honest truth.  Go ahead.  As Ali.  What's the difference between a Jew and a canoe?  A canoe tips.  One of the, probably one of the, the more classic of the anti-Semitical jokes. 
[00:02:00]  So he says this in a crowded room.  The crowd, which included a number of Jewish people, including Ali actor Ron Silver, laughed nervously.  Nervously.  But Ali wasn't thrilled.  Here was his next joke.  A black, a Puerto Rican, and a Mexican in a car.  Who was driving?  The police. 
[00:02:30]  And it says blacks and Hispanics in the crowd also paid Ali the courtesy of laughing.  Courtesy.  The Washington Post's Lloyd Grove, who was at the party, reports that Ali's fourth wife, Lonnie,  tried to head off his routine as he took the mic, pleading, no, no, no, don't.  No!  Ali's rep admitted his humor was politically incorrect, but argued,  these are not new jokes.  Oh.  Mohammed told him.  I know, I understand the struggle.  Mohammed told jokes. 
[00:03:00]  Tells them all the time because he likes to make people laugh.  I know, Ali.  And he shocks people to make a point.  He always manages to diffuse any situation that seems overly reverential.  Reverential.  R?  Okay.  Following the film, everybody was paying tribute to him, and he was in a good mood.  By the way, the premiere was a fundraiser for...  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  You want to buy a dryer, a door?  I owe my daughter money, and I'm dodging her. 
[00:03:30]  I know the struggle.  Well, the politically incorrect jokes.  I don't know.  He's a guy that could get away with it, though.  Oh, yeah.  You know, the grease man, he didn't really tell a joke, but, you know, a little off-color  remark there, and that's it.  Yeah, well, Ali.  Yeah.  Yeah, you did some other...  Let me take the stage again.  Well, you were going to do some more jokes, but they yanked you off the stage.  And we have a national radio show here.  Would you like to try some of your other jokes out on the people? 
[00:04:00]  A black guy walks into a bar with a parrot on his head, and the bartender asks,  Where'd you get that?  And the parrot said, Africa, they're everywhere.  I am the gravest.  Oh, God.  What do you call crime fighting in Harlem?  Uh, what?  Oh, boy.  What? 
[00:04:30]  Abortions.  Ali, how's your Mercedes driving?  It's brand new.  It's only got 100,000 miles on.  Yeah.  You notice there are no black people in the distance?  The future looks bright.  The future looks bright.  I didn't even understand the setup, Ali.  Well, how do you fix a woman's watch? 
[00:05:00]  How?  You don't.  There's a clock on the oven.  Why, why is Stevie Wonder smiling all the time?  Why?  He doesn't know he's black.  Wow, they really liked that one, Ali. 
[00:05:30]  What do you call a pimple on an Italian?  Uh, what?  A grease fitted.  A lot of black people have flat noses.  Oh, wait.  We heard that one.  Yeah, we heard that earlier.  Earlier.  Yeah.  Why don't Italians have freckles?  Why?  They all slide off. 
[00:06:00]  How did the Polish mother teach her son of which way to put on his underwear?  How?  Yeah.  Yellow in the front, brown in the back.  I, I got a million dollars.  Hey, uh, what do you get when you're costing an Italian in a Polack? 
[00:06:30]  Huh?  The guy make you an offer he can't understand.  Hey.  What does a black man get for Christmas?  What does a black man get for Christmas?  Your bicycle.  What's, what's, what's white with a black a-hole? 
[00:07:00]  What?  The A-team.  The big yellow one's the sun.  No, that's Brian Reagan's big.  The big yellow one.  That's Brian Reagan's bit, uh, Muhammad.  What, did you, did you hear about the new black French restaurant?  No, I did not.  It's called Shea what?  What? 
[00:07:30]  What did Lincoln say after a five, five-day drunk?  I freed the who?  What's the, what's the definition of a black foreplay?  Huh, what?  Don't scream or I'll kill you.  How does an Italian girl shave their legs? 
[00:08:00]  What, what?  I didn't, I didn't, I didn't, I didn't understand that.  How does an Italian girl shave their legs?  Oh, shave.  They lay down outside and have someone mow them.  There's D-Con 4 going, how do you stop a black baby from crying? 
[00:08:30]  Oh, this whole gag.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  Let's yank you up Muhammad off the stage.  No, no, no, no, no.  What?  No, no, no, no, no.  What?  Pope says, Pope wrote C words.  No, that's Otto and George's joke.  Get in the coffin.  No, that's Otto and George.  What did the two Jews say to each other?  Huh?  If we walk two more miles, we have all the oil.  My mother's struggling.  My mother's struggling. 
[00:09:00]  What do you call a black man with no arms?  Uh, what?  Trustworthy.  What?  Come on, man.  Well, these all, you know, but I am the gravest.  There's Smolder and Joe Frazier.  What do you say to a black man wearing a suit?  Oh, what?  Will the defendant please rise? 
[00:09:30]  Thank God you're black, Muhammad.  Yes, I'm right.  Boy, I notice an anointed amount of black jokes.  How do you get a one-armed polack out of a tree?  Oh.  You wave at him. 
[00:10:00]  All right, well, look at that.  Thank you, Muhammad.  Thank you.  I mean, it depends on how sliced, then you slice him.  Oh, my God.  No, don't just start doing the puns, man.  What's the difference between Batman and a black man?  What?  Batman can go to the store without Robin.  They have to pick cotton to get to him. 
[00:10:30]  No, no, Muhammad.  What?  What?  Because they're Negroes.  No, man.  What's that?  So birds don't crap on their lips.  No, no, Muhammad.  What's that?  Thank you, Muhammad.  Eventually, the crap turns white and stops stinking.  No, thank you.  What's the problem?  Thank you. 
[00:11:00]  I forgot some of the beginning of the...  Thank you.  That's because you're an F and an A, and then wipe your D on the curtain.  Nothing, you already told her twice.  All right.  Thank you.  Yeah.  Two in the front, two in the back, six million in the ashtray.  Tell Mexican kids they're the pinata.  No, man. 
[00:11:30]  They'll stick black Velcro to the ceiling.  You're awful, man.  Crime prevention.  No, no.  From the pepper spray.  No.  Behind the eyepiece of your rifle.  No.  Father's Day.  A tycoon. 
[00:12:00]  So they don't bite their fingers when eating Twister Roll.  We'll be back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Stay there.  Coming this spring.  On the Opie and Anthony show.  The Keenie Softball 2.  The Return of WoW. 
[00:12:30]  King Norton's World Tour.  Sex for Sam.  WoW Stop.  All coming this spring.  On the Opie and Anthony show.  Opie and Anthony.  1027.  WNEW.  Let's get a party going.  Let's get a party going.  Let's get a party going.  Now we've got a party going.  Party.  It's a party.  Party.  Let's get a party going.  Let's get a party going.  When it's got the party going.  We'll always say that.  All right, Anthony, are you ready for Middle School Confessions? 
[00:13:00]  Yeah, I'm trying to find it on their website.  By the way, Adam Farrar in the studio.  How are you?  All right, we have 12 clips, Anthony, from Middle School Confessions.  This was a show that was on HBO, what, last night?  Last night, HBO.  It debuted on HBO.  They'll run it another ten times, don't worry.  I can't find it on their website. 
[00:13:30]  Well, it's a little saucy.  It's quite racy, if I must say.  Saucy and racy.  Saucy, you think?  A bit risque.  It's very risque.  And I'm amazed that these moms would allow HBO to film their slutty daughters in middle school.  Yeah, if someone had to sign a release for that.  I didn't understand that myself.  Watching the tape.  The host, Samuel L. Jackson.  Which is a little funny.  Really?  Yeah, he's talking about middle school kids having sex. 
[00:14:00]  Which one's yours?  It's the one that says, bad mother...  Yeah, so this is a show, kind of an expose on middle school kids, what was that, anywhere  from 12 to 14 years old, talking about sex. 
[00:14:30]  Talking about getting Hummers.  And drinking and what they do.  Talking about digits.  Digitally manipulated.  And we don't mean math.  Boyfriends.  Boyfriends.  Right.  And one girl with the braces, the slutty girl.  And the other girl talking about how she's pure, let's just say, in every sense except  the mouth.  Same girl.  Same girl.  Racist girl?  Big face full of braces.  And she's just going to town. 
[00:15:00]  Going to town.  And then the parents are talking.  And talking about how their kids, they don't know what their kids are doing.  And then there it is.  And you put this on HBO, you know these kids are going to go back to school and, hey,  oh, go, go, go, go.  Hey, you're the BJ girl from the HBO show.  They don't tell you what schools they attend, do they?  No, Norton.  And thank God they don't.  Well, they did tell us one school.  Yeah, that was the gay kid.  The gay middle school in Belleport that Stinky went to.  Stinky went to that school. 
[00:15:30]  Stinky went to the gay middle school.  It's right around the corner from this house.  Oh, my God.  A gay kid came out of there.  So what does that mean?  I don't know.  The school's gay.  There's a pattern developing here.  Let's get Stinky in here for a sec.  Stinky, you went to that gay school?  You went to the gay middle school.  Everyone's gay at that school.  I couldn't believe it.  I didn't see it, but.  Yeah.  Was anyone gay when you were in middle school?  Of course.  You know, we were in middle school.  No, but you don't.  Gay people in school all the time. 
[00:16:00]  Ones you know, ones you don't know.  You knew kids in middle school that were gay?  I didn't know them as far as like.  But you knew they were gay.  Oh, absolutely.  You didn't see kids that walk down the hall and you go, that kid's gay.  Yeah.  Whether he knows it yet or not.  He doesn't.  He's a choreographer.  Right.  He's a fan.  They usually, yeah, they help out in the plays.  Yeah, they help out in the plays.  But they're not acting in it.  They're doing the, you know, and one, two, step two, turn two, step two.  And I didn't even know in high school who was gay. 
[00:16:30]  Swear to you.  I could say, well, a couple of the theater guys maybe, but I didn't know for sure.  That's what I'm talking about.  You knew for sure people, you knew for sure kids in middle school that were gay.  Yeah, yeah.  Because you saw them.  They acted, what do you call, gay.  Well, Ann, didn't you say one of those kids, like when you were young or something, hit  on you or something?  Oh, that was in California.  And that was, what, junior in there, so.  Yeah, yeah.  Hey, hey, gay.  Did he give you a mouthful of a treat, did he?  Didn't get to that, Jimmy. 
[00:17:00]  Get a good one.  Get a good one.  Come on up.  Get a good one.  Get a good one.  Just a hug.  Yeah, no, the kid's in school that you knew.  In middle school.  And you're like, ah, the kid's gay, yeah.  Uh-huh.  Absolutely.  No clue.  Well, you've got to be a little observant.  They were usually very neat.  Yeah.  Right.  Tiny people.  Well, very, very friendly with some of the teachers.  Mm-hmm.  Well-dressed.  You know, like that.  Well-dressed. 
[00:17:30]  Tastefully appointed.  Right.  They would talk about things that the rest of the kids didn't talk about.  Yes.  You know, Broadway.  That's good.  That's not.  The graffiti on the notebook was like a hat.  There's a kid who knew everything about, right, Broadway.  If you were in the play, Bye Bye Birdie, does that mean you were gay?  Depends on what you were doing.  Were you the birdie?  Playing the girls.  If you were playing some of the Bobby Soxers.  I was, uh.  I'd say you were a little gay.  I sang a little.  Did you?  Really?  I was one of the singing teenagers there.  What an abomination play was that?  That they got Opie singing in it. 
[00:18:00]  Were you really?  Did they give your little blonde locks a tussle?  Tussle.  I was one of the singers there.  Oh, yeah?  Really?  And I can't carry it to it.  In the chorus?  Yeah, we were in the chorus.  We had a sitting chorus in the band.  Work out the songs and stuff.  Uh-huh.  He was in the chorus.  All right.  I had a sing and make believe I was on, you know, a telephone at the same time.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  No, that's not even remotely gay.  That's very masculine.  Yeah.  Fine. 
[00:18:30]  Yeah.  Did you live with Paul Lynn for a couple of years?  Oh, we got a clip of Opie on the phone at that, uh.  How fat for a topper.  Ho, ho, ho.  Bye, bye, Barney.  Ho, ho.  Why is Stinky off the hook?  He was gay in middle school.  He grew out of it.  I think he went to the gay school. 
[00:19:00]  The gay middle school.  That's featured on that.  Yes, and now these kids are back at school, and now everyone is discovering them as the,  you know, the people from the BJ girl or the gay guy.  You know, all the teachers saw that.  Yeah.  And then they showed the parents.  They had a whole group of parents that were in this, went into the middle school at night,  I guess, with a sex education teacher.  And the sex ed teacher is talking to them. 
[00:19:30]  That was a long time she had sex.  I know.  Did you see her?  She looked like a guy from the gay school.  And she's sitting there and talking to these parents and saying things like,  what would be acceptable sexual behavior for your children at this age?  And then you get like the parent of the daughter that was given the Hummers is like,  French kissing, like saying little things.  It's like, no.  How about deep throating?  Because that's what your gal is doing. 
[00:20:00]  Brushing your teeth with a c***.  Oh, no.  Wait, you can't say that, Hopi.  Brushing your teeth with that.  No.  I'm sorry.  You can't say that.  Did you learn that in the play?  Without a portion of Bye Bye Birdie?  Easy.  A whole.  A whole.  So we got some clips from middle school confessions.  The best part of the group meeting, though, quickly with the sex ed teacher between the  parents, the men, the fathers sitting there as they're asking these questions. 
[00:20:30]  It's just like, I'm not hearing you.  La, la, la, la.  Because what guy?  Because the second she starts talking about it.  Do you know there are students in this school practicing oral s***?  This, that, the other thing.  Blah, blah, blah.  What?  I can't say that?  I can't say it?  Just say oral.  I'm saying, okay.  Practicing, doing oral.  Please, like that matters.  Oh, you bunch of s***.  Nah, I'm sorry.  I have a curse right there. 
[00:21:00]  I get so upset.  They're dumping out like crazy.  With what we have to say.  Well, you've got to protect the kids.  I know, exactly.  I guess we could say they're innocent.  We could say oral, but we can't say oral.  Don't say that.  Yeah.  And you certainly can't say what Ann said.  No, no, no.  If you go to middle school, you can experience it.  You can do it.  Right.  So the fathers are just, they're getting these discussions.  And you know, they're just images conjured up of their lovely little young gals doing this.  When they interviewed the parents, did they know what the kids have said?  Or they just asked?  Some of them kind of had an inkling because of notes they found in their clothing and stuff like that. 
[00:21:30]  But I don't think they knew until this special that, you know, the brace-faced chick is hoffing like crazy.  Oh, God.  And the other one, the 12-year-old that was getting the manipulation by the boyfriend.  And she was horrified.  She's like, I found out because some anonymous twat sent her a note that ratted out the daughter.  And she's like, I got nauseous.  Yeah, what a...  And I got very nervous.  And then when my daughter got home, I addressed her, I gave her the note, and she said, it's true. 
[00:22:00]  Oh.  Oh, so there's your little girl.  Daddy's little girl.  What a tattletale, that friend.  I know.  What a beeswax.  God.  Isn't that awful?  Yeah.  Somebody, it was, it started, the note started, it takes a village.  What?  So, meaning that it takes everyone in the community to make sure everyone turns out okay.  You know, that Hillary Clinton bullcrap that she was spreading.  My daughter got manipulated, now I'm dodging her. 
[00:22:30]  Now I'm dodging her.  Oh, God.  I'll be in Cleveland, handing out the bumpers.  Suffering fuck-a-tash.  I'm buff.  Hey, Rabbit, you want to buy a dryer?  Go work.  So, is the set up good?  Can we get to the clip?  Oh, yeah, yeah, we do have clips.  I believe this girl that you're about to hear is 12 or 13 years old, Anthony.  Oh, yeah?  12 or 13, right?  All right.  13.  13.  Tender age of 13.  One of, oh, gee. 
[00:23:00]  Oh, no pointing.  I'm ready.  All right, here it is from HBO, Middle School Confessions.  At parties, while I'm drinking and I'm having fun, I think I engage in more sexual things  than I would normally.  Sometimes I get really wild.  Those were probably the most times that I've been taken advantage of by guys.  I have woken up in the morning and just been like, I can't believe I did that. 
[00:23:30]  What's all that yelling in the back?  That party that they're at.  Yeah, they're at a party where it's nothing but kids.  What were these parties when I was 12 and 13?  You know something?  Where are they now?  Nothing but kids groping each other.  This HBO thing, they had a camera around with 13-year-old kids just groping each other, making  out, copping feels.  That one drunk girl on the couch clip.  There's a couple of guys sitting on the couch. 
[00:24:00]  This drunk chick, her head falls right into his lap.  She rolls over.  You just see her eyes going, cuckoo, cuckoo, cuckoo in her head.  She's smashed.  Smashed at 12, 13?  Yeah.  And this girl talking, you heard what she just said.  That's any hose bag anyone's ever known in their life.  And now instead of just maybe a few people in that school knowing, the country knows.  Because she said, you know, I got a party, I got a little drunk.  I wake up and go, who?  What did I do?  Who don't know a hose bag like that?  Isn't this great news, too, all you soccer mom twats? 
[00:24:30]  It's happening to your kids.  Yeah, this, believe me.  They're drinking out of mules left and right.  Oh, O&A are bad people.  Don't let them listen to that.  Watch out for the video games and they're blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Good for you, involved parents.  You know something?  You bring up a great point because this wasn't some inner city school with kids that were being neglected by their parents.  This was all middle to upper class white kids going to parties at these nice houses of their friends and stuff and just hob and nob. 
[00:25:00]  Nice village you live in.  They're saying that, you know something?  Even the slut ones are virgins.  They're saying, you know, hey, I didn't give that up.  You know, that's like a way to rationalize it.  They don't give that up.  That would be wrong.  But, I mean, more icing than a strudel cake on their face on any given night.  You know, I think intercourse is wrong, but I would rather, you know, gobble love snot.  That's fine.  That's it.  That's a treat.  That's what they're doing.  Because they can't tell them no to parents. 
[00:25:30]  Well, I want to have communication.  They don't tell them no.  And I'm glad they don't tell them no.  The more kids that do this, the happier I am.  I love it when these stupid parents are confused.  That's why sitcoms suck.  Because I have to hear about your kids and what they're going to hear.  Right.  And I love what they're doing behind your dumb soccer backs.  Except for the job, Adam, the job.  No, I've got a sitcom.  I don't count that as a sitcom.  That's a dramedy on at 9.30 this evening on Channel 7.  Right.  It's a dramedy, man.  Drama and comedy.  That's not like a bunch of cutesy little dialogue. 
[00:26:00]  Like, uh-oh, look what we're doing.  This stupid underdog.  We would have the 12-year-olds on the show.  Hey, Matt's a teacher.  Matt, you're next on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  I'm a 7th grade teacher on Alan, and I am not surprised about any of this at all.  What grade do you teach?  It doesn't matter.  7th.  7th or so?  All right.  7th grade.  They're 12 years old.  And the stuff they talk about in the hallways, guys, it blows my mind away.  Yeah.  I mean, I'm 25, and when I was in 7th grade, all I cared about was, like, baseball and 
[00:26:30]  the Carly Warriors on Nintendo.  No, I'm not going to go that far, because obviously everyone was very, very, uh, you  wanted to have sex at that age.  You're in middle school, and it's raging hormones, which they mention, and you wanted  to have it.  But you know something?  It wasn't there.  It wasn't as easy.  Oh, some people were getting it.  That's fine, you know?  And you'd pick and choose and get some stuff here and there.  It's part of growing up.  I had nothing to pick and choose from.  But these parties that they were showing on this HBO special, where they're drinking 
[00:27:00]  and manipulating each other.  Dude, I lived four houses away from my middle school when I was in my 7th, 8th grade.  On lunch break, because I had a Rolodex going all day, I would run home on lunch break, scrap,  and then run back and feel guilty like all the other kids know what I just did.  Dude, scrap.  Yeah.  That is great.  Scrap.  Scrap.  Yeah.  I'd go home, and I would go back and feel like the other kids all knew what I just did,  but I would look and think of all the heinies I saw. 
[00:27:30]  Because they did, you filthy guy.  You.  Filthy.  Hey, you want to hear another clip from Middle School Confessions?  Yes.  We got plenty of these.  All right.  Blah, blah, blah.  Check this out.  We haven't been going out very long.  I mean, it was sort of my first time.  We were over at her house with, like, a whole group, and we were in a bedroom alone together.  So things got kind of out of control, and we were making out and stuff, and he ended up 
[00:28:00]  going down my pants.  At first, they told him not to, because I didn't want to, and then, um, but he did it  anyway, and, you know, it did feel good, and I did enjoy it.  Oh.  By the way, the girl you just heard, 12 years old.  12.  What?  12.  12.  12.  Psycho Mark.  What?  Where is she?  What's her number?  12.  Talking about going to parties.  Two. 
[00:28:30]  Get in the room.  Now, this is stuff I absolutely recall happening at parties 15, 16.  Yeah.  That age, you know?  Mm-hmm.  You're going to the party, you're doing that.  12?  Yeah, no.  At 12, I distinctly remember a great day was a Bic lighter and plastic army men in the woods.  Right.  Or a magnifying glass and an ant head.  And some bugs.  Sure. 
[00:29:00]  You got, we got to get Nick on the line here.  Nick, you're next on the Opie and Anthony show.  What do you got?  What's going on, boys?  Hey.  Hey, man.  How's it going, buddy?  I got a brother who's in middle school, and a couple weekends, he's asked me to pick him  up liquor.  He comes home the next day after sleeping over at Buddy's house.  He's got better stories than I do on a weekend.  Yeah, right?  See?  And there were always girls that would do this in certain schools or anything.  But they were the ones with the bad rep.  You know, the rumors of the girl would be like that. 
[00:29:30]  And it wouldn't be a lot of girls.  Now it just seems, oh my God, this is the, if you could get a Hummer in junior high, you  would have been king of the junior high.  And you would have to tell everyone, because there's one girl, I think we're going to have  her clip in a little bit.  She was surprised that the guy told everybody else at school.  Things changed.  Things flip-flopped, because I remember it was a lot easier to get laid than it was to  get a Hummer back in the day.  When I was 12, I didn't even know they would do that. 
[00:30:00]  Forget about even getting it.  Yeah, I didn't.  I didn't know that was, I didn't know that was part of the whole story.  You didn't know that was possible?  I didn't know that was one of these, I was looking at hardcore pornographies.  I knew there was a world out there.  Yeah, exactly.  Eight years old, I'm looking at hardcore.  But you'd find it in the woods, and it was rained on.  With the color pages.  It was like all smutty black and white pictures.  And then in the middle, there were maybe six color pages with just nasty, hardcore C-shots  all over the face and everything. 
[00:30:30]  Right?  I was raised to steal Wii Magazine.  This is seventh grade.  Yeah, Wii and Penthouse out of a machine.  I would take a screwdriver and jimmy the machine and steal it and just go home and arc them  all over myself.  You guys were acting like, wow, I didn't mean there was kissing in high school?  What are you talking about?  Those are the days you'd get a good magazine, you'd go once, and then follow it up right  away.  Pia Zadora.  Keep going.  Oh, the Pia Zadora issue in the bathtub.  I don't remember.  Oh, yeah.  I remember the bathtub.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:31:00]  Yeah, sure.  Pia Zadora.  Sure.  Kevin from D.C.  I don't know if this is true.  Kevin?  Hey, O&A, man.  What's up, Morton?  Hey, sir.  Hey, I swear to God, guys, this is true.  It's about a year ago.  The kid was 14 years old, like a white suburban middle school in the suburbs of D.C.  This kid was running a little prostitution ring out of his high school.  He had a handful of girls.  High school?  Or middle school.  Middle school.  14 years old.  So what, about eighth grade or whatever?  Yeah, there you go.  I swear to God, he was running his prostitution ring.  He had about 10 girls, I guess. 
[00:31:30]  Because I could see how kids that age would think it was cool and kind of fun and kinky  and something you're not supposed to do.  Excuse me.  How much was he asking to see somebody?  Norton loves these quotes.  Make sure they have a feminine back.  It's a large back for a gal.  How you doing?  We got our pleasure menu.  I'd like to see it.  Girls do enjoy tipping.  All right.  Want to hear about it? 
[00:32:00]  Froy from Jersey.  He's saying, at 12, didn't party mean you were going to the roller rink for someone's birthday  and ice cream cake?  Hell yeah.  Now partying is...  Here's another clip from Middle School Confession.  All right.  I think this is another 12 or 13-year-old, right?  12.  12.  12.  I think, personally, the sexual things that you could do is, like, have a guy f*** you  and you, like, maybe, like, give him a handy. 
[00:32:30]  And, like, I think, like, it's okay, like, if, like, he fills you up and you guys, like,  make out that, like, at this age.  But I just don't think it's okay, like, to go, like, all the way.  See, there's the rationale that was never in place when I was in school.  It's perfectly acceptable.  There was either girls that did it or did not do it.  That's why you effed and you got the Hummer and you got the whole package, but it was very hard to get.  Now it's broken up a la carte.  The girls are a la carte. 
[00:33:00]  I'm sorry.  We don't have the V.  We don't have V on the menu tonight, but we'd be happy to give you the Hummer and the Handy.  If you want to take that out.  And, well, let's see what's on the back of the menu.  Flip it over.  Because that's acceptable, too.  As long as the V is kept fresh.  Can I substitute the digital manipulation for the fries?  Yes, absolutely.  I'll write that down.  Let me check with the kitchen.  Even though it's a school night, is that possible?  Can I get something delivered? 
[00:33:30]  So now it's all divvied up.  And the Hummer has turned into something that was akin to maybe making out.  You know?  Now it's like, hey, I don't go all the way, but, yeah, I'll throw you that.  Oh, jeepers.  Gee, you bitch.  Who wouldn't be skipping la, la, la through the hallways the next day if girls were doing that?  I'm 35.  My last Hummer cost me a tennis bracelet.  All right? 
[00:34:00]  Nice.  Yeah.  We have lots of these clips.  We'll play one more before we take a break.  All right.  What is this one?  Middle School Confessions from the HBO show.  This is a little clip about Oral.  Oh.  All right.  From a 12-year-old.  That's something new.  I think Oral is okay to do because it's not an intercourse, and I just feel that it's okay.  I don't know why.  A foreign trooper.  Isn't that?  Oh.  Oh. 
[00:34:30]  Oh.  Oh.  Atta girl.  It's like a lot.  That makes me want to have kids.  Oh.  How much?  In what way?  That makes me want you to have kids.  I'm happy.  It's amazing.  Imagine the parties.  These are kids.  I'll babysit, Norton.  These are kids that were on camera.  Nothing blocked out.  You didn't have any digitizing of the face or anything.  These, not electronically, anyway.  And the parents of these girls that you just heard are on there talking about sex. 
[00:35:00]  Is that something to do to your kid?  Yeah.  If she's doing it, hey, what are you going to do, you know?  But then to splash it all over HBO, if I may use the term splash, it just seems to me like you shouldn't be allowed to do that.  What's the bumper sticker say?  My kid's a hose bag.  Yeah, yeah.  Ask me about my slutty granddaughter. 
[00:35:30]  Proud to be the parents of a receptacle.  My daughter gave a Hummer to an honor student.  Ask me about my sea dumpster.  That girl can suck the color out of a marble.  Wow.  They seem very fine with this going on.  Hey, Paul, what's going on?  Check this out.  Hey, man.  Hey, I got the story.  My brother, he was 10 years old, and he had this little teeny bopper girlfriend. 
[00:36:00]  Guess they were at her house, and their parents were at there.  Girl starts giving him a Hummer.  My brother starts looking around like, what the hell is going on?  Oh, my God.  Kid had no idea what was going on.  Teeny bopper is giving away Hummers like Tic Tac these days.  Look at this.  Matt from Jersey has a whole timetable.  Yeah.  He goes, I'll settle things right now.  Here's the timetable.  12, Handies.  13, Hummers starting of booze. 
[00:36:30]  At 14, you get the digits, and the lucky ones have sex.  Booze way up.  Pot smoking starts.  15, more sex booze.  Everyone smokes pot.  16, who hasn't at least gotten a Hummer at this point?  And then he says, Hummers are like promotional tools today.  It's like a throwout, a promo that you throw out there to let people know what they're in for.  Like a keychain.  Right.  It's a promotional tool.  It's a mag-light flashlight with your phone number on it. 
[00:37:00]  It's a good-to-know-ya.  Hey, how you doing?  Sally, the class president.  It's like, how are you?  Yeah, those school elections must be something these days.  And we should take a break.  When we come back, we've got the clip, the virgin talking about how she's a virgin except for her mouth.  It's wonderful.  She's got a tattoo on her chin that says, Merging Traffic.  Beware.  Keep hands and feet away from the hopper at all times. 
[00:37:30]  How much?  Middle school confessions continue on the O.B. and Anthony Show next.  There will always be retarded idiots to entertain us with their stupidity.  Mindless.  Crotch-grabbing.  Anthony.  Mindless.  O.B.  Crotch-grabbing.  Anthony.  People grabbing their crosses and saying, suck it.  O.B. Anthony Show.  Suck it.  Law of the show.  Mindless.  Mindless.  Mindless.  Mindless.  O.B. Anthony.  O.B. Anthony Show. 
[00:38:00]  T-W-N-E-W.  I want you to be free.  Don't worry about me.  And just like the movies will play out our last scene.  This is the O.B. and Anthony Show.  A big thank you to Buffalo today, Anthony.  Buffalo, you guys, you rock, man. 
[00:38:30]  Buffalo gave us what?  Washington did it.  Yes.  Washington gave us the clap yesterday.  Yeah.  But Buffalo, man, wow.  Buffalo is as sweet as a 12-year-old girl.  Oh, God.  It was starring in The Job tonight, 9.30 on ABC.  ABC.  Season premiere.  Tonight's episode.  Sacrilege. 
[00:39:00]  Sacrilege.  That's the Quinn Martin voice.  A Quinn Martin production.  Epilogue.  Lisa wants in on this discussion.  Lisa, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  Just have an opinion on why these young kids are doing some serious fooling around.  Yeah.  You think maybe your show has a little something to do with it?  Oh, yeah, that's what it is.  Yeah, hopefully our show has something to do with it.  You and everybody like you.  Don't you think you have a little something to do with it?  That's Lisa.  No, maybe it's parents that don't pay attention to their kids, don't do parenting, and blame 
[00:39:30]  it on other things.  Or maybe it's just slutty hose bags.  Well, the guys are, too, from my opinion.  I mean, I'm looking for it.  A guy's idea?  Well, you think that's hot?  No, I don't.  That's supposed to sound sexy.  No, I think parents are very responsible, but I think it also helps when there's shows  like yours on the air.  Oh, shut up.  Shut up.  Don't listen, you twat.  Oh, you're so funny, guys.  How old were you?  Keep listening.  Lisa.  Sorry, me?  How old were you?  Lisa, you sound really stupid, because you're obviously listening to our show today.  Yep.  So, if we're not funny or entertaining, then why are you listening to the show? 
[00:40:00]  Because I'm very intrigued by what you guys are talking about.  There you go.  There you go.  Thank you.  Intrigued.  It's a really important subject.  Tell your friends.  Right.  It's an important subject.  Yeah.  Good luck to you and your pig children, stupid.  Oh, you're sweet, Norton.  I can see why more people like you.  Why are you talking with that stupid fat girl?  I know.  You hear that?  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Stupid fat girl.  You guys finished now?  No, stupid.  We're not.  Finish now.  We're not your boyfriend, so you can't kick us around and inasculate us. 
[00:40:30]  Like the twat you are.  Poor guys.  Are you finished now?  That's funny.  Is that what your husband says?  Yeah.  Okay, guys.  I'm finished.  I'm finished now.  Yeah, you are.  Hang up and suck.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Nice try, Lise.  Nice try.  Bye-bye.  Keep listening, though.  Yeah.  Intriguing.  That's a...  We certainly could use the listeners in the D.C. area.  That's the girl that scrubs the toilet right after you beat her.  That's what I like.  I listen because I'm intrigued.  I scrub because it was dirty and it hit me. 
[00:41:00]  Ugh.  At least she knows my name, though.  She must be listening.  Gee, Lise.  You heard it.  Yeah.  Damn it.  She was like, yeah.  Sorry, guys.  Oh, imagine having to go home to that voice.  So, I guess it wasn't important enough to do that.  You know, with the fake laughing lilt to the voice when she's pissed off and she puts on that.  Well, why wasn't the long cut today?  I guess other things were too...  Bam in the face!  You know what that is?  That's trying...  That's passive-aggressive. 
[00:41:30]  Yeah.  Because for many years, daddy snuck into the room at night, so you really never learned  how to express your anger at men.  Call back, stupid, and just say, it sucks.  I hate you.  Have some courage.  Don't call up and try to be smarmy and smug.  You're not bright enough for it.  Yeah.  Smarmy?  Yeah, but that smugness is...  You've got to be really smart to pull that off, and that lilt gave you away.  All right.  More clips from Middle School Professions, the show that was on HBO last night, okay?  12, 13-year-old girls talking about stuff. 
[00:42:00]  Yeah, this was some...  This is the virgin show.  The virgin girl, Anthony.  Virgin girl.  How old?  12, 13.  I think she's 13, this one.  Yeah.  13?  Yeah.  This is 13.  Listen, what's going on?  I've never sucked with anybody.  I'm still purely virgin.  Except for my mouth.  Cool.  I didn't hear that.  You've got porno music in the background.  I didn't hear that.  Could you replay that?  I've never slept with anybody.  Never slept with anybody.  I'm still purely virgin. 
[00:42:30]  Except for my mouth.  Okay.  Terrific.  And you know why?  It's because of this show.  Yeah, that's it.  And it has MFP fluoride, so it's good for your teeth.  I hope it is because of this show.  You know how great that would be?  Yeah.  It's our show.  Chrissy!  Yes.  Hey.  I've got to tell you guys, thank you, because I've got a 13-year-old daughter, and I'm now  never letting her out of the house.  Are you dodging her?  Sorry, one.  You're not letting her out of the house? 
[00:43:00]  No.  Never.  No.  Thank you.  I didn't see this on HBO, and I'm sharing this now.  Chrissy.  I'm messing myself.  Chrissy, do you know what she's up to, if anything?  I keep a pretty tight rein on her, so yeah, I think I know what she's up to.  You know something?  So did these parents, man.  Watch this special, it's like...  Don't tell me that.  Oh, my God.  Does she go all over to a friend's house?  Of course she does.  Does she ever spend the night?  Yes, she does.  Get her jaw wired.  Do you know...  No.  Don't say it. 
[00:43:30]  Don't say it.  Does she have friends that maybe you'd prefer she didn't hang out with?  Not anymore.  Not anymore.  She did.  Not anymore.  She did.  She used to hang out with them.  There were a couple of girls that I put my foot down.  You got it?  She fell in.  With a fast crowd.  No, not anymore.  No, huh?  No, no.  And what's the worst thing that you...  But no, you know what?  What's the worst thing you caught her doing?  I haven't caught her doing anything really bad.  At this point, her and her girlfriends that she's around now, they talk about having crushes 
[00:44:00]  on boys, but...  Crushes.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  But, you know, any house parties that she goes to, there's parents there.  Yeah, sure.  And anything else is a school activity.  House parties.  What's the roller rink?  Mm-hmm.  All right.  All right.  Well, it looks like Chrissy's doing a good job playing, though.  Thank you, too.  You should do the best you can.  Godspeed, and good luck to you.  Good luck to you.  Thank you, guys.  I mean it.  Thank you for playing this.  All right, Chrissy.  Well, this next clip is going to make you drive off the road, so...  Hold on tight, all right?  All right.  All right. 
[00:44:30]  Bye-bye.  Well, this is a girl talking about Oral Anthony.  All right.  12, 13.  13.  13.  With Oral, it's really kind of fun to do because when the guys get it, they kind of give you  more attention for it, and they're really happy with you and stuff like that.  Sure.  They're happy with you.  Oh.  And they give you more attention.  They learn young.  Yeah.  That's a healthy home life. 
[00:45:00]  Jesus.  Boy, I hope...  They give you more attention.  Boy, I hope Sandy's listening.  Oh, my God.  She's going to slap your face, man.  You know what's sick?  I'm going to ask my girlfriend.  Now you've got to punch him.  Now I've got to punch him.  You've got to punch him.  Not hard this time.  But that's actually a good point.  Kit raises a good point.  Yeah.  You want love and attention?  Well, what are you bringing to the table?  Hey.  You know, a lot of these girls, I think some of the clips they play later, they're  saying this, that they don't want the guys to do anything to them. 
[00:45:30]  They don't want...  They don't want to receive...  They don't want to be left alone.  They just want to give the Hummers.  Right.  Because, you know something?  If you're a guy and you're laying back and you're getting that, and believe me, at that  age especially, how thankful you are at that, that girl is a goddamn princess right  there.  What she's doing.  And they could see it in the way you're...  You know what's wrong?  Lifting your ass off the couch. 
[00:46:00]  You know what I mean?  So, of course, you're going to dig doing it.  Pulling the lint out of your ass.  More commentary on oral, Anthony.  Where did the upholstery go?  Oral in the middle schools.  Ah, right.  From middle school confessions from HBO.  Yeah.  My boyfriend and I were going out for about six months before I gave him...  And we liked each other a lot. 
[00:46:30]  It was kind of like, I can't believe I did that, but after, I was like, okay, that's  cool.  Little giggles.  Yeah.  I like when they giggle.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Unfortunately, they giggle right when you take your pants down.  It's not good.  Yeah.  And they point and squint.  Where is it?  Things like that.  Point and squint.  Nothing like a fond, girlish giggle, though.  It looks like one only smaller. 
[00:47:00]  When they say that, it's bad.  One day, that'll get hair.  You know, it's just awful.  It's amazing that they put this on TV.  What are the parents thinking?  That's what they're saying about our radio show out there.  I'd be like, you know something?  It's amazing.  They put this on TV.  I'm all for it.  And I'm not talking about telling HBO they shouldn't air this or any kind of censorship.  I'm talking about parenting and going, if you get a kid that's saying this on TV, in 
[00:47:30]  front of a camera, and you then sign a release that says, yeah, fine, because the kid can't  sign the goddamn release.  The parents got to sign it.  It can't.  It'll be in crayon.  The parents got to sign it.  Oh, yeah.  Put my daughter talking about how she hobs it on television.  I'm sure it's going to be great for the father when he goes to the office on Monday.  It's not like HBO's catching on or anything. 
[00:48:00]  I don't think the neighbors have it.  Hey, Tom, isn't tomorrow bring your daughter to work day?  Hey, hey.  It's just a fan.  I'll bring the lube.  Bring your daughter to work day tomorrow there, Bob.  I saw your daughter on HBO last night.  We're all eagerly awaiting by the water cooler.  What's it?  Bring your little whore hose bag to work day tomorrow.  Stupid parents allowance.  Very stupid.  Stupid parents.  I'm thankful that they're so stupid.  This one's going to make some moms drive off the road. 
[00:48:30]  Anthony, the next clip from middle school confessions.  Okay.  More about oral.  People think that that's going way too fast, but a lot of people are doing it now.  I kind of wanted to create a closer relationship with my boyfriend, but then he kind of thought  that once he got it once, he's going to get it often, and it got us closer, but we broke  up after, oh, he dumped her afterwards, huh? 
[00:49:00]  He thought he was going to get it all the time.  You know, God damn.  It's a lot like marriage.  It's a lot like marriage.  She gives it until once, and it's like, come on.  It's been five minutes.  Ladies, don't you know that's like feeding a puppy?  You know when you put milk outside the door?  That dog ain't leaving.  Right.  And where would she record this?  A daycare?  What was going on in the back?  I know.  Did you hear the background?  House parties.  That was a, yeah.  They went into one of these house parties.  That was a little house party going on as they're talking about oral. 
[00:49:30]  Woo.  How about that?  But I thought my daughter was going to see Harry Potter.  They said they were going to go see Harry Potter.  Harry Potter?  I didn't know.  Harry Potter.  Harry Poker in the Saucer's Bone.  I never had reason to doubt her before this.  Harry Potter?  The parents love when we do stuff like this.  They love stories like this.  Minnie.  Yo, what's up, man?  What's up?  I got a 13-year-old son and a 17-year-old son. 
[00:50:00]  The only part is like the first time you catch him having sex, the first thing that goes to your mind is, oh, no.  And then the second thing that goes to your mind is, oh, thank God, they're not gay.  Oh, there you go.  It's like totally different, you know.  If I had a daughter, tonight she'd be like handcuffed in the basement.  I'd be concreting over the door.  She'd never get out.  But your 13-year-old, you know, has had sex already?  Uh, well, I know he's gotten something from somebody because his friends called him up one day and he's like, yeah, she was hot and she tasted nice, too. 
[00:50:30]  So I figured he was getting a little something.  That could be anything, though.  Maybe a little nuzzle on the neck.  I don't know.  It got a little more graphic than that.  I can't quite explain it to you.  You heard that from your 13-year-old?  Yeah.  He was talking on the phone.  Good boy, though.  He's going south already.  He's a team player, that guy.  That's nice.  That's nice.  I told my 17-year-old son in the backseat of my friggin' Mercedes in the goddamn garage.  I go downstairs to get, like, a friggin' 12-pack out of the garage.  I open up the light case. 
[00:51:00]  And all I see is a pair of feet up against the windshield and a pair of s*** pop up behind my eyes.  Oh, wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Oh, hey.  Oh, oh.  Hold on, because you can't say the T-word.  Danger.  Danger.  You saw her feet up on the windshield and a pair of her T's.  Yeah, it just popped up.  And I was like, the first thing that came to him, I was, he's having sex.  And then it was like, but he's not gay.  yeah do we have do we have the clips from the middle school gay guys all right hey that girl

[00:58:00]  all that evidence and the police coming over to investigate duct tape garbage bags what are you  gonna do i'm not taking a hole look i'm not saying there was all kinds of experimentation going on  with uh the girls there was like the kissing stuff but at five years old i mean you like a girl you just  push them you know that's yeah that's funny i kissed a girl yeah i know you did we we listened  i remember uh uh when i was it had to be at least eight years old or something making out in the 
[00:58:30]  basement of the apartment complex with a girl and it was like you know that that might as well have  been sex because it's all i know she's running her fingers through your afro yeah that was pretty much  it my angela davis afro i went to the people afro thank you daniela bye guys young lauren hilton  jacobs finds love yeah that's what it looked like how many more clips we got we only got three  more another clip on uh well what a surprise oral and more oral in middle school giving has nothing 
[00:59:00]  to do with your body they don't have to see you or feel you or judge you in any way it's kind of like  you're in control and stuff i think i'd feel more comfortable with somebody that i wouldn't know  because if i did it wrong it's okay because i'm not gonna see you again wow okay all she had to say  to that was a silver saturn oh jesus that was that girl with the braces again she's a 13 year old with 
[00:59:30]  the braces uh talking about how hey she likes doing it uh the guys don't have to touch her or see her  body or anything like that because she says she's a little self-conscious and uh she prefers it with  people she doesn't know because if you do it wrong it doesn't matter you don't have to see him again  she's a glory hole yeah a glory hole with shoes that's it it is a glory hole with a bus pass yeah  a traveling glory hole and for some reason the parents felt it was perfectly fine to put her on 
[01:00:00]  that their daughter that their daughter talk about what a whore slut she really is  how do you do well honey i wanted her to take dance lessons but if you think this is good for  her i'll sign the release i'll sign away she wants to act so she said she sucks what okay i'll write that  okay fine to air go ahead there you go that's my gal 
[01:00:30]  she doesn't see like her 13 year old girl and especially being the youngest in the family  she sees me as being the baby i think and sometimes i feel as though i'm being treated like  a baby so i don't want her to know any of the things that i do that are not so good treated like the  baby here's your binky i think you need your binky and one more clip i feel like i've completely lost all  my innocence when you're a little girl you like when you see kissing on tv it's like 
[01:01:00]  i'm like when you do you're like being intimate and oral with guys it's just like you're not that  little girl that wear hair and piggy tails and ate a cake with frosting all over her face but you  know you can't change the past so i guess there's nothing i can do about it  that's the beginning of a porno movie yeah it goes the music and everything the music goes into a  dream sequence and it goes in on the strippers all you need is max hardcore that's it you lady 
[01:01:30]  either that or the other uh video collection where you write the c-word on our forehead and smack her  in the face but max hardcore is the originator of that guy the whole uh that genre that genre  what was that uh series called that was called slap happy happy i'm sorry jim norton silly me tim  what's up how you doing guys hey man uh long time listener second time caller uh i've got a three 
[01:02:00]  month old and what you guys are a three month old daughter and what you guys are talking about is  absolutely scaring the hell out of me you got a good four or five years before you have to start  worrying according to some of our i think i'm gonna go and get the stapler out and staple up a few  things uh holy yes i don't know what you could possibly do aside from moving to some barren  wasteland in alaska uh and then she'd probably come home with a moose i'm just thinking there's nothing  a guy can do if you have a daughter and because they come from the best of homes they come from 
[01:02:30]  the worst of homes the parents think they're doing a good job the parents are doing a crappy job and  they wind up becoming doctors and and and whatever they do a great job they rebel against the parents  because they're giving them too much and they become hose bags there's no rhyme or reason to  it my friend you just f'd up and and one of those uh the y chromosomes or something kind of being a  good guy that's certainly scary you also remember when you were 14 trying to do anything and everything  possible of course it's only gotten worse you have a daughter that's for sure you remember knocking on 
[01:03:00]  some guy's door and asking for his daughter when you were a kid never did that sorry she came off home  right i know the struggle she's dodging me too all right tim thank you hey guys have a good day bye  you stay in this room i'm going to cleveland to hand out stickers you're not leaving until i get back  what's up there a second mark no i was gonna say the parents are morons who would ever put their  daughter on national team well that's retards that's the point we're making retards yeah that 
[01:03:30]  apparently you can see where they went wrong right right right there are some really uh hot stories  coming in on instant feedback but we're trying to uh show some responsibility today with this  subject dana from cleveland so she uh became active at 10 with digitally and at 11 uh orally with girls  whoa oh 14 uh lost it to a boy this is all on the instant feedback and 17 uh became oral with boys 
[01:04:00]  hey let's take a break let's take a break everyone this friday the 55 gallon drum challenge  it was in my mouth it was replayed in its entirety  on the op and anthony show and ew  ladies and gentlemen welcome to the boardwalk resort hotel here on the sprawling disney complex 
[01:04:30]  seems there's a hostage uh situation at disney world open yeah i see that goodman uh holding  what a disney employee hostage at one of the hotels here in the happiest place on earth how are they  going to spin that you know disney hates like negative publicity remember that poor guy that got

[01:10:30]  no no that's true what do they do they'll always wheel them away in an ambulance and then they pronounce  dead like uh at the hospital or something or dead dead on arrival or something like that no one  can pronounce dead here at disney they probably have like you know goofy and pluto come out with a  goofy stretcher and like grab the guy's wife instead of the guy that's laying there and then and then hit  each other because it's fake you know oh no wait it's the guy oh they run off wacky 
[01:11:00]  it's the wildest ride this side of the pecos make sure you keep your hands and feet inside the  ambulance at all times patrick yeah what up yeah i used to work at disney too and that's true they  gave a guy who got struck by lightning mouth-to-mouth resuscitation he was better than snot i mean the  paramedics were giving him mouth-to-mouth resuscitation all the way out of the park because they refused to  pronounce him dead oh really yeah that's something all right patrick like you said spray it down keep

[01:16:00]  the hose this guy says he has some twisted stories about disney mark what's up guys how are you former  uh cast member cast member they're not employees they're all cast members who who uh i was a monorail  pilot for uh two years pilot yeah like it's like you're going you know i'm gonna turn left today  yeah yeah you know i'm the pilot i'm the pilot i'm going left now all seriousness i mean there's 
[01:16:30]  so many dark secrets about disney i wish somebody would just like write a decent book about already  i mean there's like one book out there called mouse tales give us a couple man you're a pilot of mine  tom cruise over here i lived in the condo complex where um a friend of mine uh there were characters  above me and uh one played goofy the girlfriend was minnie whatever but um making one story short he uh  witnessed an accident that uh took place between a company vehicle and uh civilian and um the uh  accident resulted in a death of civilian and uh the local sheriff and also the uh disney cops or 
[01:17:00]  disney cops believe it or not um and uh they told him if he saw anything or if he said anything that  he would lose his job and this and that and they threatened him with a bunch of things wow that's the  way it is you gotta figure they they bring in so much revenue for the state that they do want to  protect it even the police department and everybody else they don't want to know i mean it's like for  example like the uh alana you know when uh the bombings in alana went out well uh during olympics uh  i was testing uh for uh my monorail pilot license and it's are you kidding is it wait isn't it just go 
[01:17:30]  and stop it's a whole test you have to go through it's not just pushy please stand clear of the  doors is that one please stand clear of the monorail doors no no no no no no it's please stand clear of  the doors both of all my thing that you have a little bit of that that's it that's it that's it  no but seriously uh some guy walked on our um monorail while this girl was testing and getting her 
[01:18:00]  check out i want to take this to cuba no no no he threatened the bomb and uh as soon as that  happened they were going between the transportation center and epcot center and as soon as they got  to the other side that was where the uh the cops were fbi and uh supposedly i don't know if this  was true or not but cia wow yeah and then uh i mean that's a million stories we had a plane crash  into us one day we had uh a plane crash into disney a little biplane crashed into uh just missed  the monorail smack the beam while the uh monorail is passing over so pay no attention to the flaming 
[01:18:30]  aircraft exactly no attention oh exactly underneath disney at night they have cockfights it's  amazing actually you know what and this is let's see we had a sniper one night get out really on the  uh top of the uh contemporary hotel this is about uh this happened supposedly it was like five years  ago wow oh my god and uh he was ready to open fire wow yeah there are there are probably so many  deep dark secrets yeah we'll continue this discussion but uh uh we don't want to get fired 
[01:19:00]  why we're not owned by them we got a lot of power we're not all these stores stories are  allegedly right anthony uh no this is all absolute facts no yeah i don't know these people work there  i'm sure uh there you go and then opie everyone knows we have to get a cease and desist first  and then and then we have to shut up all right welcome to the bottomless kick of ignorance  oh i feel like being an idiot anthony i'm a retard the opie and anthony show i think hilarious 
[01:19:30]  and we're back with the opie and anthony show rick james in the house  building security is up here everyone excited to meet rick james today i want to meet him let's

[01:20:30]  his eyes right now like oh geez you know how much other stuff i've done right and this is like the  tune that uh everyone knows you're for this is a shame yeah yeah how you doing rick good man yeah  good buzzing doing all right keeping busy pumped up man yeah excited to be back in new york  very cool yeah you know something uh i've been fascinated with the life of rick james i got to  tell you not many people rick you gotta be i mean please not many people have gone through so many 
[01:21:00]  things in their life as you you know so hopefully they don't well yeah well some of this stuff is great  i mean i love the whole thing when uh especially when that song was popular you know what i could  see you were you were knocking them down left and right you know a lot of a lot of girls hot chicks  of the day just clamoring over you yeah and uh you were living the life yeah and uh then all of a  sudden highlight all of a sudden all of a sudden this story comes out behind the music yeah this story 
[01:21:30]  comes out that here's a guy that's getting chicks all over the place then a story comes out that  have to force the chick to have right and i'm like now come on think about that i want you i want you  to think about that one exactly it's like why would rick james who is getting chicks left and right  then have to uh force someone who loves drugs to do drugs right there you go something is not wrong  with this picture exactly it seemed a little off well see that's you know that's one of the things 
[01:22:00]  behind the music field dimension i think uh i was pleased with behind the music uh other than the  fact i was pleased with it yeah other than the fact that uh a lot of the stuff that went on uh that  was sealed by the judge uh the d.a didn't and uh the d.a's are bribing uh witnesses and giving witnesses  drugs and things really things to to allow yeah a lot of stuff went on it did yeah and uh i mean  with their right mind i really yeah i really have to force a woman to have sex yeah i really have 
[01:22:30]  to do that for some reason and i really and i really have to force them to to to uh i really  have to force girls who've been kicked out of uh states because of their drug addiction to do drugs  it seemed to me like i have to do that it was people it seemed to me like it was just a group of  people that enjoyed doing some drugs and uh having some sex got together and all of a sudden she uh  freaked out well no what it was was she came to my house uh she came to my house with with his other 
[01:23:00]  girls six in the morning i guess she told the jury she came to a cocktail party i always have them at  five in the morning and um and um and we and we and we were you know we were hitting it we were on the  floor in the class somewhere it was in the first half an hour anyway she stayed for like a month and a  a half a month and a half a month and a half and i had a long ass cocktail party i guess when she  finally went back to her pimp or her man he was a little pissed off and uh and she came out with 
[01:23:30]  the story yeah and uh they just you know it was much more to that i mean i got a book coming out  called confessions of a super freak one we're going to expose a lot of the stuff uh that the judge hit  and um a lot of that there were there were a lot of stories of uh like torture though that were  right i'm mark you decide right i torture every woman sure let me just believe that it's true  because you're my idol sorry you know i love the concepts you know i mean uh mark you decide one 
[01:24:00]  of my favorite characters in life the images bug's buddy and uh yeah every woman i think i've ever had  sex with i think i've tortured maimed cut stabbed yeah the images that it kind of that's why there was  somebody lined up around the courthouse and uh right rick james just going uh nuts and and uh  torturing a woman the images it kind of was like wow what the hell is going on look before we make  love they have to get tied up and tortured and stabbed that makes sense yeah yeah yeah that sounds 
[01:24:30]  like norton's date yes you know i don't spank i don't spank butts i just i i i i brand them is that  fit so there was no torturing uh sorry for all of you s&m freaks who line up there with your whips  and chains nah i'm sorry now they go see prints for some reason the jury didn't buy this no they didn't  and they sent you away well really now you are doing at the time you were into uh doing crack is that  what no no i don't know see and that's that's another thing you know i really i hate to say i don't do 
[01:25:00]  crack and didn't like crack i free based ah okay you know some of a lot of people that freebase the  coke don't like when it's called uh doing crack no no it's it's much more freebasing cocaine a lot  more civilized it's so politically correct it sounds cooler um it sounds cool it's a lot more uh it's  sure i'm freebasing for those out there who think crack and freebase are the same um you're a fool  yeah right yeah that's why they cost to say that's why you go buy a crack for ten dollars and 
[01:25:30]  freebase very refined you go out you get your ether ammonia you mix it up see there you go  going back to the old days reliving those times really those old feelings rick i gotta say i part  took in a little freebase cocaine myself and i'll tell you one thing uh and you're here to talk about  it did make you feel good but as soon as you did it you wanted to burn and torture someone didn't you  well yes i did and i captured a lot of uh people and uh and tortured them and they're still in his 
[01:26:00]  basement did you ever get high with uh did you ever party with richard fryer did you have prior  no matter of fact uh what i say when richard he used to do that drug um that's what made me not  want to do it yeah see for a long time i was totally against something we used to start going  in the 80s all the time who didn't wreck and uh at every session every time we recorded you know  it was like it was like the end thing to do you hang out studio 54 and you know play them and you  or paris wherever you go and you snorkel came but i used to watch people really change 
[01:26:30]  and richard was one of them man richard used to get really weird off off frebation and girls would  like take out all these bottles and and baking soda and ether and all this stuff and i never understood  that so for you know a long time i was down on that yeah i i really cursed the day that i started  i went from spending like who showed you uh the the rebate who showed you well what happened was i  went i was sorting and i was spending like i don't know two or something thousand  and how's the air and it's from jose and writing it on jose coco some strange name right off right 
[01:27:00]  and then and then and joined a street song so we went to chicago and i don't want to name the  organization but you know they were a political organization so the guy came in and he had this  big uh case and it opened up like four ways right and and these pipes and all this stuff  and he said and he says um i mean have you ever done this and i said no and then he closed the case  back up i said what are you doing he said well i'm not going to be the first one to turn you on 
[01:27:30]  i said i was just kidding i was just kidding i've done that before i've done it before i was just  kidding right and he opened it back up and i had my uh one of my security was about six foot six  and he said he had tried and he lied to and uh so he made himself a baby and he took a hit of it  and he fell flat on his back yeah and i says i gotta have that everyone remembers that first big uh  puff of uh freebase smoke and i never quite got out of it but i i did hire someone to go on the 
[01:28:00]  road and cook it up for me yeah and they all these groups used to steal him because he would cook so  good he was the good guy why are you making me remind me of all these guys because it's interesting  wait so there was just a guy that followed you on towards and that was and he cooked yes yes and  his job was to cook my crew told us that they had a drug deal that would just matter of fact he was so  good he was so good to cook he would cook up the coconut and the water would be invisible  and he would go in the room and bring back another rock oh how about that he was very good would he use 
[01:28:30]  the uh eye dropper and no man no no put it on a slate or something he was just he was just a really good  cook and thief and he was just he's just a really good cook and all of these rock and roll groups  and people used to steal them didn't you realize rick after the first hit you never get quite as good  a buzz the whole rest of the night you know but i couldn't understand the high you know it was like  it was like when i when i first when i when i first read a bass i didn't understand that high 
[01:29:00]  no it took me three four or five times to really get it and once i don't understand no no really i gotta  get it no no really because when you store it i mean bam you know what it's like okay but when  you but when you start smoking you don't understand something you're trying to say well what is the  big deal yeah and then next thing you spend five six thousand dollars a week on the big deal  and you wonder then you know what the big deal yeah yeah right it's called addiction oh serious  addiction wow so you were going through a lot of cash yeah yeah kind of got you into a little  bit of trouble i guess well you know well that that happened really the all the trouble was 
[01:29:30]  it came forth like my mother was uh i was on california i brought this house and mickey rooney's  there and um um um this beautiful place matter of fact i was gonna say it took me like four months to  realize i had this beautiful rose garden on the side of the house i gotta just stay to my book you  know my mother was dying of cancer at the time and i really didn't care about living and dying so i brought  a lot of degrading people around me and uh i didn't really care about who hung around you know 
[01:30:00]  and it was mostly a lot of women and there's a lot of degradation you know self-destruction yeah and it  was you know i didn't care so i brought a lot of people around you know i was i was um cruising for  a bruising you know yeah i was headed straight forward i didn't really care so when all of that went down  it really saved my life i mean you know because really it was uh it was a curse turning to a blessing  because sometimes stuff like that happens and you end up dead instead of uh i mean the judge the  judge wanted to you know the judge wanted to give me like three lifetimes and i was like getting 
[01:30:30]  high every day and snoring and going to sleep in court i said three lifetimes how do you do three  lifetimes will you like die and come back and do like another lifetime if you were able to come back  you would have to go back to prison yeah he was calling me all these names charles manson  and money decided how much how much time did you get well really what i got was i got five years but  it was suspended into like eight months at a drug thing but when i went to the drug person uh i didn't 
[01:31:00]  know that the uh the uh the head of the prison was allowed to exclude you if you had violence you know  and there was violence on my record you know and um so she excluded me which means she put me out of that  and i'm kind of glad because i had done that eight months i would have been on parole probably for  the rest of my life damn near yeah so she said so i went to uh she excluded me and i induced for five  years and i did close to three years at Folsom prison three years which was Folsom prison which 
[01:31:30]  was fantastic really yeah what's the experience i just want to hear what your experience was in uh in  prison what does rick james think now when you you're brought into Folsom now you had a hell of a  friggin career i was the last one and and i was the last one off this bus right and all these guys are 
[01:32:00]  just shackled me and dropped off at prison and i got this little bag and and and and and the cop  tells me he realizes i'm rick james he says wow if i knew it was you i would have gave you an extra  baloney sandwich and i said well you know thanks a lot and i get off the bus and these four thousand  guys are in this yard and all of them stop and come over to the fence uh-oh and start yelling yeah rick  mary james we'll meet with mary jane girls come to my cell that i rob rob rob that's like oh like 
[01:32:30]  who do i hook up with oh what's really going on but you know what it was an experience because um  i grew up uh i got a chance to kick kick the drug um i got i wrote close to 300 songs when i was there  i always said to myself i needed like two or three years to clean out you know and i could have got  nine percent i mean there's there's plenty of drugs in prison uh but like you really want to get  out with a bunch of dudes around right i'm used to get out with four or five women drinking crystal in 
[01:33:00]  the sauna laying in the pool that's that's the thing you're going from that to now you're you know  those bars slide yeah and everybody next door you know what was going through your mind did you go  like oh my god no where the hell did i f up you know what it took me i had uh it took me a while to  sober up really and by that time i was like on my way to folsom i mean i had no i had gotten out of  the crc uh which was that narcotics prison and i was on the way to folsom and uh reality said it 
[01:33:30]  because folsom's like a uh a bestia or it looks like an old castle it's a very famous prison they  sent me to yeah they sent me to the very worst well let's send them uh let's send them to the  worst place we can successful in the world and uh uh folsom was it but uh and the seals were all rednecks i  mean they're all guys right yeah they have lots whether i would survive or not who would be the  first one to shoot me who would be the first one to beat me down who would be the first one to lock  me in a hole who'd be the first one right now what did did anything uh happen any stories of uh no man 
[01:34:00]  because those cats looked after me man it gave me more love even i mean even the arian race i mean  even really even guys in the arian race because uh and a lot of lifers uh because  had i went in there a punk or had i went in there stuck up or had i went in there acting better  i probably would have been there you know but i wouldn't i mean i'm i'm me i'm what i am rick i'm  rick and most of them i lived uh like i met guys who've been in there 20 years 23 24 25 years man 
[01:34:30]  and they had pretty much grown up to me right on my music but they were white chicano m&m's bgf 411  crips bloods mexican mafia it didn't really matter bringing them all together through rick james music  no man they had they had yeah they would love the mary jane girls and they they would ask me questions  you know and i've worked in the library and you know put a lot of them down on reading and writing  and uh it became an experience man it became uh it became a really nice experience what you what 
[01:35:00]  you do to uh satisfy yourself you make up one of those uh washcloths with a glove in there and  the we heard about that what's it called man uh you know black people don't do that kind of stuff  what's that what was it called do you remember i forgot no no no what is it you see you have a  good grip on it what is it i don't know i don't know what that thing is rick you take a washcloth  and you wrap it up real tight no man i didn't have to go through that all i had to do was call a  certain lieutenant or certain sergeant females and they would come oh yes three o'clock were you 
[01:35:30]  banged in prison unlock the cell and take me to a room wait tell me you were getting banged in  prison i got what i wanted in prison baby you know money talks a bull walk that's right i'm  rick jane what do you think i'm just gonna lay there and i got like five female security guys  walking around talking about oh i just love mary jane hey do they bend over on the other side of the  bars for you no they open the bars up and then they bend through it i think it's more erotic if  if you do it through the bars so if i'm frank well you want a little piece of history i had a 
[01:36:00]  cellmate we had to kind of keep it cool yeah so yeah but no i mean honestly what did your cellmate  do while you were getting banged he wasn't around they'd tell you they would open up the cell and  they would tell me to come to a room and oh so it's like you're going on official business somewhere  you know yeah middle meeting exactly the room would come up and uh go drink some wine and have some  steak and you know eat a few other things get some yeah get a little bit god damn rick james  sex huh were they charged for the sex no one charge it's rick james it's rick james man charged they're 
[01:36:30]  just uh doing it to get some of the rick james no what it was was there were there were a lot of uh  folsom had a lot of like uh uh lieutenants that were female and sergeants yeah and they had clout you  know so if they wanted me out of my cell two in the morning or three in the morning they would just come  and you know say we want to talk to them in private and never do that well you don't think  i what you don't think i played wow did all the other uh guys in the prison ask to smell your  fingers when you got back from the meetings or anything because that would be like rick rick 
[01:37:00]  i gotta sniff that digit where they use the dream cream you you would have been watching your eyes too  much yeah you eyes out that show scares the bejesus out of me i would never even want to go near a prison  forget about it everyone seems to be getting it in the uh can somebody told me um yeah because  of that show we're not going to be torturing any girls anytime no no no way i was up for a part in  oz and um and the people told me everyone that does a part for that has to appear nude that's what it 
[01:37:30]  seems like right no well that's what it is yeah and um say really that's totally ridiculous i mean  it never happened but i mean i really didn't want to go through that prison experience again are you too  shy to be nude on uh tv there rick no but they're going to pay me more money than what they were  offering here's a legendary oh my god we've all heard the stories uh no no you know you are but  but you guys are the first guys that really i mean well i just told you the truth that happened  there yeah you guys are the very first guys never asked me that question really i never got into that 
[01:38:00]  oh you'll be asked tomorrow's we're ridiculous what happened was one and you know when i left these uh  uh these these two uh lieutenants who threw me like just kind of like a little party um  they got fired which was really sad right after i left because of what they were doing no because  one guy came in and he was he said he was take one guy who was fully uh he was a ceo and he he was  kind of taking pictures of all of us you know eating pizza and men party and it was the night before  i left and um that that was really the saddest part of the pizza party yeah i had a pizza party 
[01:38:30]  before i left that's right ate pizza that's right what do you expect rick james what do you expect  i'm supposed to be in there i'm just thinking prison rick and i'm thinking you know prison is prison  man and if you got you know if you got what you got you get what you get i know it from oz i'm  thinking rick james in the weight room looking for someone i keep telling you that's kidding here  comes the arian nation look out they're trying to shank rick james dive in front dive you know i had  one fight man you did and see i see it wasn't it false against some uh uh uh russian type arian dude and uh

[01:40:30]  late no but no back to that linda blair yeah she had done a layout in we magazine now the only thing  i knew about linda blair was i was scared to death when i saw exorcist yeah i'm not gonna lie about it  i'm not gonna sit here and try to be macho man no scary goddamn movie whoa hey hey and i'm sure it did  everybody who was back at that time yeah and um linda did a layout and she was like it was cold  blooded i mean she was like damn all those cans she had oh yeah it was a serious layout and they 
[01:41:00]  asked her and along with her like the four or five page color pictures of her laying by this pool and  all this like and all this other stuff they asked her uh who if there was one man that she had to be  with who would you want to be with and she said rick shames and that's an invitation to for rick  in a goddamn wee magazine yeah exactly pretty much but you know what in the old days that's how  actresses and actresses got together really they would just say something in an interview right  so i okay how long did it take you to drop the magazine well my belly came to me the guy who was 
[01:41:30]  working the guy who was working for me he said look reggis and i sent her some roses and i ended up  doing a wee layout too and we met here right in new york with mark uh over mark feiserman's yeah uh hotel  and we met um and um hit it off yeah we became really close wow that's uh and then what what  happened uh with the relationship because you guys were together for how long we were together  for off and on for a few years we're still very close are you yeah that's cool oh what happened  to the real was it something that uh you did the drugs play a part or uh yeah i was yeah she was trying 
[01:42:00]  to stop i mean and she had virtually pretty much stopped i mean she was still drinking a little but  it's kind of hard to hang out with the guys well well no i mean she um did she give you any of that  exorcist talk that f me f me f me you mean did she roll her head around and something like that  screaming the f me f me after no no no no no no y'all got to get limited here in the stands  see i won't talk no no i can't you guys will get her in here and y'all do the same thing i'd love to 
[01:42:30]  have her in here she's very pretty good she's a very very sweet person without any detail i'm not  going to ask you to you know tell tales like that i'm not going to get it but there had to be some  point especially the first time you did get intimate where you're like screwing the exorcist  chick it's like i'm gonna uh no uh no no no no no no no no no no see you with your ego you're  probably like she's probably thinking i'm screwing rick james that's cool that's cool man i'm not even 
[01:43:00]  going to touch it man yeah i'm not going i'm not going near it i hear you i'll still hear about it  she'll never speak to me again yeah yeah i heard you on that show saying you're a giant rick and i  was pulling and stretching his muff or whatever grabbing some gravy or whatever mule and yeah i  hear you it's a fifi by the way that's good a fifi a fifi yeah the prison badge is called a fifi oh a fifi  the homemade uh the homemade thing yeah what they called it a fifi they call it a fifi in the joint  some guys can't just ring up the guards and bang them in another room they got to make a fifi well 
[01:43:30]  well you know hey everybody ain't rj you know what i hear you i get the stuff okay that's for sure  what you think i'm gonna go in there and let george or bubba like drill me like i said my only knowledge  of prison is oz and that's all i want to even i never want to get any closer to prison than my television  set and sometimes that's too much when they're showing the guys doing each other who needs that  rick you know what i never saw a whole oz no never saw a whole oz i see little bits and pieces every 
[01:44:00]  time i see i kind of laugh because it's always over dramatized yeah i mean it's not really like  well where i was um i mean you have your sex you have your arian race and you have your mexican mom  and you have your that's enough for me to not want to go and everybody does sit in their parts of the  you know uh in in in the kitchen or whatever and but uh you know this you know and sometimes  fights break out and people get shot but i mean yeah whatever you know it's down there it's prison  dramatic because uh yeah it sounds yeah you know something it's scared straight for me you remember 
[01:44:30]  that show scared straight where they scared the kids uh by taking them into prison matter of fact  don't they have a woman on there who's like who takes stuff from dudes like whatever she wants for  something and she's kind of like i'm taking you oh one of the uh guards yeah she comes up and just uh  uh much like uh rick jane and then and then the guys refuse sometimes yeah well she's a heifer pig  who cares when you're doing 25 years you don't you don't care if she looks like prince you don't  do that that's right yeah you know the question that everybody's been afraid to ask rick what did 
[01:45:00]  you or eddie murphy write party all the time no i i wrote party all the time you did poor eddie  g you wrote that just for him yeah wow well the song did well at the time jim yeah it did  actually yeah that song was the number one against radio's uh permission the radio didn't really  want that song to go anywhere i got it i know you guys see you guys eddie was eddie was already a  multi-multi-millionaire yeah he wasn't doing any interviews he didn't want to talk to you guys 
[01:45:30]  you guys were always trying to get him he was saying yeah he was saying to hell with you and y'all  didn't want to play that record but people kept calling up you know those little old women who live  out there who don't seem to with y'all obviously i don't have the same thing going on because  y'all say what the y'all want to say and just get away with no no y'all do y'all get away with okay  no one else can get away with y'all get away with but i just can't uh nobody in the world can get 
[01:46:00]  away with it wait a minute rick wait now you're gonna bleep me hold it rick we're having we're  out of dump now we are right out of delay that's hilarious yeah we're right out of delay now we're  gonna have to play that with all the bleeps in it i know every time you curse they dump they dump out  of the show you guys man are incredible you get away with you we have fun we have fun rick but rick  isn't this fun though you're being honest we're asking some questions it's being fantastic and no one's  starting off their radio because this is fascinating we learned that rick james was  getting back into prison i was i was already was like is it true your mother ran numbers for the 
[01:46:30]  italian mob yes she did she ran numbers for the gangsters and she fed eight she raised eight  children by herself so much from running numbers from running numbers and i'm proud to say she also  played numbers too oh yeah what you know that is you go to sleep you dream and you wake up and you  play a number and you hit well she did that too and uh she hit off all of us and all  she made it very very lucrative uh sent my brother to georgetown university top law school 
[01:47:00]  sent my sister to this top uh county school with cpa um she we she did very well yes she did run  numbers i'm proud to say it numbers runner nice yeah my family did that too but i'm italian so it's  though it was the law no we had to pay y'all that's it hey john you're next with rick james what's up  hey hey how you doing james i was wondering what do you think about uh mc hammer make all that money  with the song uh well number one if you didn't make all as much money as you think uh he um when 
[01:47:30]  someone does a song of mine they have to make a deal with my administrator mc hammer did about an  80 20 deal where he made his money was when he was uh touring um i make the majority of the money  when they do a sample deal okay uh but what he did wrong was buying helicopters and guns for the  oakland police and uh and and horses for 500 000 man that guy knew how to spend his money he was a  a total fool and and really the thing i'm really pissed off about i'm not no he paid no i got paid 
[01:48:00]  very well off that and uh but the thing i'm really mad about he never ever really once said one time that  you know it was a rick james song he never uh because he won awards for that song right no we  won no we both you know we won a grammy together because he put himself in as as one of the writers  and he uh but he never said you know he said i read one magazine he said i took a rick james guitar lick  what you know but yes he played very very well and he got very very broke 
[01:48:30]  i say that another great behind the music was uh him now he's a freeser buying that goddamn mansion  that he bought and uh now he's a freeser and brought the oakland police and guns and help yeah  hey here's something you're gonna kill some more blacks  we know you need help i know you need help so here you can't touch this go kill some more of the  blacks in oakland here's some helicopters and guns that i made off of rick james record go kill 
[01:49:00]  seems like you're holding a grudge there  well you know hey god bless him like i said he's you know he's preaching now they all go to god when  they get broke even in prison everybody gets very religious yeah they all become muslims and christians  and when they get out of you son of me you brought you probably uh you know got a got a little more  spiritual but you didn't go the whole route right well you know i'm i i was born catholic so i got  uh that messed up my head was messed up from the jump you know now i mean no bespoke old spirit 
[01:49:30]  troubles at all the point man right right i'm i'm i'm a true spiritualist you know i truly believe  in in god and i try to uh i try to stay takwa you know god conscious everything i do you know and uh  i just try to be a good person man i think everybody was expecting after your uh hardships  for you to come out and uh have the collar on and just start preaching the words of jesus  uh hey hey yo no no no no no no no if anything i'm just preaching for people man to have fun man 
[01:50:00]  and uh just do each other better man love each other that's what it is see a lot of the rick  james songs are just all purely about effing which i think was great no no you know that is totally  wrong yes you know that is like no that is totally wrong man i've written songs about mxr's icvm's a  missile i've written songs about dropping nuclear everyone knew what that missile was a big slong rick  i got the metaphor i've written songs about mary jane i mean mary jane slang for that  every song i know where you're coming from it doesn't work what you're saying every song i've 
[01:50:30]  ever written has to drink a little wine every now and then how about some weed  what are you offering you got some mary jane you got some good mary jane mongo outside now you got  some good mary jane you gonna have out in the front for me well hey hey we got a stairwell rick  that was like we take it out to the stairwell what do you think it's all good what do you  think of today's music let me just put it like this there's some rap out there that is positive  but when rappers get out there needs to be word and the n-word and when they talk about shooting 
[01:51:00]  each other and they talk about ak's that i completely frown down on okay uh totally so i  mean there's probably more negative rap out there than there is positive they'd say we're just keeping  it real you know they can say what the hell they're taking it from the streets what they  grow up with you know what and then putting it on you know what most people that say the  n-word has no idea what it means because it has nothing to do with black or ignorant or anything  they have no idea what it means a nigger means foul fish in swahili in a world translation book it means 
[01:51:30]  foul fish has nothing to do with ignorant we used to call ourselves that out of an endearment thing  white people took it as a derivative thing number one so they don't know what the hell they're saying  number two every woman to me is not a bitch my mother isn't one my sister isn't one my lady isn't  one and i hate to hear that word that one that says you're kidnapped her is one she's the only  bitch i know call her a c-word that one but that's the only bitch i know but but the bottom line is is  that black music is where it is is basically one reason is because the government has taken musical 
[01:52:00]  instruments and stuff out of schools so these kids don't really have a way to go so what do they do they  sample and they do the best that they can uh i wish that lyrically uh they would uh start singing  about mules again to another level but they'd say they'd argue with you that like you know rick maybe  you're just not in touch with what's going on these things you know what there's nothing more going on  than what it was before there's still a ghetto there's still poverty there's still drug addiction

[02:03:30]  dislodge it and they have to tranquilize me and and put a new transmitter on my back  that's when i need more zoloft you ever see him do that on the wild kingdom show with the bear  they give him the tranquilizer and all of a sudden his lip gets all loopy and his tongue sticks out of  his mouth you want to see when the mike tyson look like that they had to pull me out of a cave once  with with a come along and they measured me and and pulled one of my twofers out to see how old i was

[02:07:00]  you  Hey, Anthony, Richard Nixon is in the news.  Yes. 
[02:07:30]  I don't want to talk about it.  Got to it.  Well, the tapes were released.  Yeah, they're playing them all over CNN.  From 1972.  Everyone remembers the Nixon tapes from Watergate, that eight-minute gap and all the controversy  of that.  And it turned out, it came out that Nixon had taped like every minute of him in the White  House. 
[02:08:00]  He had secret microphones.  This guy was one of the most paranoid, scared of communism, anti-Semite.  He was a racist, a very bigoted man.  And he was, quite frankly, the most insane president we ever had.  And Ben Stein wrote for him.  Ben Stein.  Ben Stein, his father and himself, Ben Stein's father and Ben Stein, were speechwriters for 
[02:08:30]  Dick Nixon.  And Dick Nixon was one of the biggest anti-Semites ever.  Yet, Ben Stein got pissed at us because he thought I made a Jewish slur once.  A little bit of hypocrisy there.  I bet if we cut Ben a check, he wouldn't have gotten as upset.  But for some reason, he could hang around while Tricky Dick was like, Ben, I need a speech.  I need a speech about how the peace talks are going in the end.  Write something, write something clever. 
[02:09:00]  I know you Jews can be clever and crafty.  Write something that covers up the truth.  You Jews are good liars.  A bunch of tapes came out.  And it's everything from him defending women being groped, to faking of napalm photos, to the kicker.  Man, I love this one.  Nixon was fixing to nuke Vietnam. 
[02:09:30]  Groovy.  Groovy.  Let me smoke a joint, then we'll drop the big one.  And what did Kissinger say?  I don't think that's a good idea.  Maybe we...  Shut up, you Jaime.  I'm the president.  President anti-Semite.  Yeah. 
[02:10:00]  In 72.  Smoke up, Hank.  Smoke up and forget about everything.  When I...  Oh, that was harsh.  When I smoke up, Henry, until you talk, I almost forget you're a dirty hebe.  So, in 72, Kissinger and everyone else laid out his options for stepping up the war in Vietnam. 
[02:10:30]  Kissinger had these proposals, like attacking power plants and docks and whatnot.  Here's what Nixon says.  He goes, I'd rather use the nuclear bomb.  I mean, did this guy understand if we had dropped a bomb on Vietnam, China and the Soviet Union would have reamed us a new ass? 
[02:11:00]  And then, right when he said, I'd rather use the nuclear bomb, Henry Kissinger goes, that, I think, would just be too much.  Jesus, of course.  And then, the nuclear bomb, does that bother you?  I just want you to think big.  Think big like your Jew knows. 
[02:11:30]  And then, he didn't drop the bomb, obviously, but he ordered the biggest escalation of the war since 68.  He later added that, um, I want to decimate that goddamn place.  North Vietnam is going to get reordered.  It's about time. 
[02:12:00]  It's what should have been done a long time ago.  Boy, in hindsight, the guy was absolutely right.  They should have nuked him.  Ben, Ben, get your, get your Jew dad, Ben, and write me a speech.  Write me something that'll get me out of trouble for nuking the little yellow slopes.  Take this down, Ben.  Dear gooks, I apologize for the crater that was previously your nation. 
[02:12:30]  We will do everything to fill it with Coca-Cola factories and McDonald's.  Signed, et cetera, et cetera, blah, blah.  Fill in the blanks, Jaime.  Nuke it.  And then, um, at one point, uh, Nixon gets pissed at Kissinger,  because Kissinger's too concerned about civilian casualties. 
[02:13:00]  He goes, I don't give a damn.  I just don't care.  They're not even human.  You ever see them with their slanty little eyes?  Slope tags.  The guy was certifiably insane, and he was running the goddamn country.  Then, uh, there's this little transfer that they got on tape.  72 again.  There was some problem with Nixon's ambassador to France getting roaring drunk 
[02:13:30]  and groping flight attendants on a trip home from Paris.  Now, nowadays, this guy would have been gone in a second.  It would have been a huge scandal story.  But, um, they asked the president about it after a Jack Anderson, uh, column regaled Reedus  with graphic accounts of the ambassador's behavior on the flight to Washington.  And, uh, you know what Nixon's answer was? 
[02:14:00]  Look, people get drunk.  And he's feeling up the flight attendant.  People chase girls.  At the point, it is, it's a hell of a lot better for them to get drunk than to take drugs.  And it's better to chase girls than boys.  But he said, I don't like the homos.  At least he's not grabbing my...  So you get a little boozed up and grab a... or two.  I've been known to reach over and grab a flight attendant's... 
[02:14:30]  every so often.  Oh, my God!  It keeps them on their toes.  Get me a drink or I'll put my thumb in your... hole.  I'm the president.  Hey, uh, Nixon, you're stealing Brokaw's bed.  Brokaw.  Another liberal communist.  I'll bury a digit in your...  Bobby Bigrigger. 
[02:15:00]  Yeah, I wanted to ask Tricky Dick there.  How do you know about nuking the women and children?  Easy.  You just don't lead them as much.  Oh, okay.  Got it.  Thanks, guys.  If they run, they're VC.  If they stand still, they're well-disciplined VC.  Nuke the whole country. 
[02:15:30]  That's a stand-on of the groping.  Then, this is great.  Who can forget the picture of the young, naked Vietnamese girl running down the street after her village, Trang Bang?  I believe her name was Kim Phuc.  Kim Phuc.  Kim Phuc.  F, no, P-H-U-C. 
[02:16:00]  U-C is her name.  Kim Phuc.  She's a gook.  Her name is Phuc.  Phuc the gook.  Phuc them all, I say.  She's running out of Trang Bang Village.  Turns out, oops.  You know, we dropped a napalm and it hit a village.  Now, people don't seem as concerned when we have that.  It's called collateral damage, right? 
[02:16:30]  It happens.  We were napalming a village.  And one went awry and napalmed a little innocent village.  It's not very funny.  Well, everyone was horrified.  It was pretty much one of the turning points of the war.  Here's Nixon.  I wonder if that picture was fixed. 
[02:17:00]  He thinks, oh my God.  He thinks there was a doctored propaganda photo.  Come on.  It looks like a glamour shot at the mall.  He talked to his chief of staff, H.R. Haldeman, about that.  And Haldeman said, could have been.  I want to consult H.R. on this.  H.R. Haldeman said, no, H.R. Puff and Stuff. 
[02:17:30]  H.R. Puff and Stuff.  He's your friend when things get rough.  H.R. Puff and Stuff.  You can't do a little, but you can't do enough.  Get me H.R. Puff and Stuff on the boat.  Once upon a summer time, just a dream from destiny.  Ben, write me a speech on how I'm appointing H.R. Puff and Stuff as chief of staff.  No, it's H.R. Haldeman, sir.  And I want Puff and Stuff.  I want the Navy put in charge of the charge of Sigmund the Sea Monster.  Get me Jimmy's Magic Flute. 
[02:18:00]  We'll nuke them all.  Oh, the witch, yes.  We can fly her over North Vietnam.  Bomb them into the Stoney.  All right, I'm having an acid flashback of this music.  I love this song.  What if we strap a nuke to witchy poo and fly a ride into North Vietnam? 
[02:18:30]  Hanoi will pay.  Oh, God.  I love that song.  So just hours of fun, tricky, dicky tapes.  Write me a speech.  Hey, Jaime.  She was a hot, naked little fook.  Look at that little fook run.  Hey, H.R., look.  She's running like her ass is on fire. 
[02:19:00]  Oh, it is.  I think it's fixed.  There must be some kind of way out of it.  I think it's that Lucasfilm industrialized imagine.  What?  Four more years?  There's too much confusion.  They faked that little fook. 
[02:19:30]  That's a pretty big hit for a Jew, Henry.  Don't bogart the bomb.  Leave it to a Jaime like you to take all my time.  I got this herb.  It's great.  I got it from Elvis.  He's a drug addict.  And I put him in charge of the DEA.  Bring in that faggot Haldeman.  I keep it in my snatch panties. 
[02:20:00]  It's a great idea.  It's going to take off someday.  Trust me.  Take some E.  Look, I got a glove stick in my mouth, Henry.  Dance with me.  Dance with me.  You're crazy.  And you're a kike.  I am an anti-Semite.  You won't have Dick Nixon to kick around anymore.  I'm raving, Henry.  I'm raving.  Bring some of your Jew bitches.  I hear they suck a mean one. 
[02:20:30]  Till you marry them.  Ho, ho.  Waddle doodle.  Oh, wow.  Bravo.  There you go.  I can't wait to hear all the tape.  We would play them, honestly.  But they are of such bad quality.  They're playing them on some of the news things.  You can't even hear them.  I don't understand.  There's subtitles so you can read it.  I mean, the tape is from 72.  It may be just in his drawer.  I slept with it under my pillow because the crafty Jews might have stolen it. 
[02:21:00]  I think the translator's just making up things.  They could.  I think he's saying, uh, nuke Vietnam here.  Half of it says, um, it says, uh, inaudible.  Inaudible.  And then I banged Kelly LeBarbrock with Leif Garrett.  It was the 70s.  It was a different time.  Now I have a 13-year-old daughter.  I turn it off.  Were you sitting at the beach with your pals waiting for the F-word?  Waiting for the F-word during the Rolling Stones.  Me and Henry and Ben Stein and his father. 
[02:21:30]  I said, hey, what's he saying, Jew?  I'm crazy.  Bang, bang, bang, bang.  Bang, bang.  I'm Tricky Dick and I'm crazy.  It's Friday.  Bang, bang, bang, bang.  Come here, checkers.  Get crazy with me, checkers.  Bang, bang.  Come on, Henry.  Come on, Henry.  Beat the drum with your nose, Jew.  Bang, bang, bang.  Bang, bang.  I want to nuke the gooks all day. 
[02:22:00]  I don't want to work.  This is a lying naked gook.  That gook is a lying gook.  Bang, bang, bang.  Nuke the gook.  Come on, chance with me, Henry.  Give me some more pot.  We're raving.  Bang, bang, bang.  Come on, Henry.  Come on, Henry.  Come on, I don't want to work.  Come on, where's G. Gordon Liddy?  Liddy, get me some acid. 
[02:22:30]  I know you can do it.  You effed up the whole Watergate thing for me, Liddy.  Justin, what's up?  Hey, I want to bang, bang, bang, bang.  Go crazy with me, Justin.  Are you a Jew?  Bang, bang, bang.  Bang, bang, bang.  Bang, bang.  Bang, bang, up the Ho Chi Minh Trail.  Spook, spook the gook. 
[02:23:00]  Spook is a lying naked gook.  Kelly, what's going on?  Hi, Asa.  How you doing?  All right.  Can we sing it?  Shut up, bitch.  I'm going to eat your lunch.  Go ahead.  Where am I, niggas?  Go ahead, Kelly.  Okay, ready?  Yeah.  Everyone knows bitches can't think.  Bobby or Bobber, what's up?  Hey, I wanted to know if Mr. President would favor us with his real-sex old man moan.  Oh!  Oh, God. 
[02:23:30]  The only thing that could be worse is Kissinger's.  I'm raving.  Hey, can we play what's in gook-fook pants?  What for?  I win.  Hey, when did you burn that off this morning?  Hey, it's not like I was flying the place.  Calm down.  If we nuke the whole place.  All right.  There you are.

This is why we need prizes.  If we had something cool, this guy would be feeling up his own sister.  Yeah.  But instead, we've got a coffee mug to offer him.  What would it take? 
[02:27:00]  Brewer tickets.  Brewer tickets.  Oh.  We can do that.  We can absolutely get you brewer tickets.  Brewer tickets.  For Irving Plaza, December 9th.  We're all going.  Brewer ticks.  I'm so telling Dad.  That's all right.  Wendy, what do you need?  She's cute and stuff.  Even though she's your sister.  Have you ever seen your sister naked?  No.  No?  No.  Wendy, do you think she's cute?  No.  She's my sister.  What do you need for this to happen?  What?  No. 
[02:27:30]  Brewer tickets.  Brewer tickets.  Dude, we'll give you brewer tickets if you reach in the box and just cop a feel off  your sister.  It's one of the hottest tickets in town.  Oh, my.  Jeff, are you kidding me?  We'll meet him.  Why not?  Why not?  Meet?  Meet and greet?  Yeah, we will get you.  We'll get you.  Believe me.  Wait, wait, wait.  Before I answer, before I answer, don't go to the next level on us.  I know what you guys do here.  Nah, nah.  This is where it ends.  You get the tickets and the meet and greet backstage.  Yes. 
[02:28:00]  But that's it.  Don't say, you know, whatever.  Tickets, meet and greet.  You put your hands in.  But now somebody's got to confirm because he could just put his hands in.  Can I just put my shirt on?  No.  What?  No.  It's my brother.  Yeah, but that's okay.  That's why it's, you know, cool.  Oh, like people haven't squeezed their sister's boobs.  Wendy, your top was in there?  Yes.  All right.  All right.  What's your name?  Jeff.  Sir?  Jeff?  Jeff.  All right.  Jeff, step over to the box. 
[02:28:30]  All right.  Cop a feel.  You know what maybe we should do to ease her up a little bit?  What?  Maybe we line up all the guys to the side so she can't see who's walking up.  Oh, yeah.  You've got to guess which hands are your brother's.  How's that?  What does she get if she gets them right?  Wait, put a blindfold on.  Yeah, what does she get if she gets them right?  If she gets it right, then you guys get to meet Jim Brewer backstage.  How's that?  She'll get it right.  Oh, like I know my brother's hands.  All right.  Get back out of the box.  We've got to put it.  Something tells me the feel won't be as passionate as everybody else's. 
[02:29:00]  We've got to put a blindfold on you.  Yeah, put a blindfold on.  Get stinky in here.  We need a bunch of different hands.  But now someone is going to have to look in.  Get her all big black hands, too.  Get her all.  Someone's going to have to look in and make sure that there's contact.  And it's not just an errant little brush of a nip.  No, Rick, you can do it.  You've got to grab on.  Rick, you can do it from the back door, right?  Hey, hey.  Wait a minute.  We're just talking.  No, that's not the back door of the box.  He just said a BJ with my dog.  Oh, I thought we were talking about that still. 
[02:29:30]  Sorry.  Don't marry me.  Carlos.  Hello.  Hey, Carlos.  What's going on, ONA?  Hey.  I don't know.  That is disgusting what you guys are doing right now.  Hey, shut up.  You're going to reen it.  You're going to reen it.  Don't reen it, Carlos.  Shut up.  You'll be listening.  Wait, wait, wait.  Check his ID.  It's not even a sister.  Shut up, you reen it.  Well, they want to go see Brewer, man.  They're brother and sister, you can tell.  All right.  Thank you.  I'm hanging up.  Hang up on him.  He's going to reen it.  You're going to reen it.  All right.  Wendy is blindfolded. 
[02:30:00]  She's blindfolded in the box.  Oh, God.  Michelle, what's up?  You guys, I love you to death, but you've reached an all-time low.  No.  Where are you going?  This is a sin.  I have a brother, and there's no way on God's earth I would let him do this to me.  Hey, shut up.  You would do it for Jim Brewer tickets.  Right.  No, I'm telling you.  There's not a chance.  I'll be in therapy for the rest of my life.  Oh, you're all hung up.  Then you'll be...  Yeah, okay.  I don't want my brother to touch me.  You got hang-ups.  You'll be listening.  Who's going away?  Come on.  There's nothing else to listen to in the afternoon. 
[02:30:30]  Right.  Where are you going?  To listen to a rack deck?  All right.  Here he goes.  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Somewhere in the line.  No, hold on.  What's up, Al?  Stinky.  Wait, wait, wait.  All right.  We're lining up the guys.  Yeah.  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on.  We got Wendy in the box.  Wendy, you topless?  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  All right.  You guys are guaranteed the Jim Brewer tickets.  If you guess which one is your brother feeling you up, you get to meet Jim Brewer backstage.  What's wrong, Stink? 
[02:31:00]  What's the matter, Stinky?  You're even disgusted by the show today.  I feel bad about this.  No, no, no.  Shut up, you're eating.  All right.  You cannot say a word.  No saying a word.  And no, like, little Morse code tweaks or anything.  You just got to do what everyone else does.  What we will do here, gentlemen, you will step up to the box, put your hands in, grab a hold,  give a little, you know, juggle, little, little bouncy bounce, little feelage, little brushing with the hands, 
[02:31:30]  and then you step away.  Then the next guy goes.  And if we can contain ourselves, when the brother comes up, it'll be an effing miracle.  All right.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Because I don't even want to look.  I think one, two, three.  We have six guys.  We have, uh, one, two, okay, yeah, we do have six.  Six guys.  Yeah.  This is what we should do.  Everyone gets a feel.  Right.  Give each one of these guys a number, and then Wendy's got to guess what number was the brother.  Why is everyone so quiet?  Because Rick's giving out the numbers. 
[02:32:00]  Wendy doesn't know if you go, you're one, you're two, you're three, you're four.  She's blindfolded.  Okay.  All right.  Are we ready?  I'm not looking over at the box.  I'm just going to laugh at every person that steps up to the box.  Right.  All right.  She can't see a damn thing, and her shirt is totally open.  This game is called, this game is called, guess which, which one is your brother feeling you up?  Feeling you up.  Now, very popular game in, uh, South Carolina. 
[02:32:30]  Okay.  Uh, Rick, or somebody, the most important part of this is confirmation of contact.  Okay.  You can't really see once arms go in that hole.  Right.  So someone has to look.  And, and, Ben, keep that mic on, Wendy.  Okay.  Number one.  Number one.  Step right up to the box.  And, Wendy, don't say anything until everyone has felt you up.  There's no talking.  That's no talking.  Number one.  All right.  Wendy.  I can hardly hear you guys.  All right. 
[02:33:00]  All right.  That was, uh, that guy felt you up, right?  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  Number two.  Step up to the box.  Step up.  And he puts his arms in.  Rick, can you see back there?  Confirmed.  Okay.  Very good.  There is number two.  All right.  Number three is stepping up to the box.  Both hands, sir.  All right. 
[02:33:30]  Did number three, uh, fill you up when?  Yeah.  Okay.  Uh, number four.  All right.  Number four.  Number five.  Number five.  Did number five fill you up?  That's confirmed.  Yeah.  Oh, Rick, you've seen everyone fill her up?  I've seen everybody so far grab her up.  And finally, number six.  Yep.  All right.  Here comes number six. 
[02:34:00]  All right.  And here's number seven.  People are coming in the studio.  Number seven.  All right.  Okay.  All right, Wendy.  Everyone in the studio has felt you up.  Uh-huh.  All right.  Uh, you already have Jim Brewer tickets for Irving Plaza December 9th.  We're all going.  And your brother has tickets as well.  For the backstage passes to meet Jim Brewer, which number was your brother?  Uh, between three and four.  Uh, four? 
[02:34:30]  Three?  Oh.  All right.  Is that your final answer?  You need one?  Would you like three and four to fill you up again?  Yeah.  Maybe you've got to get three and four again.  Yeah, three and four again.  Yeah, three and four.  Because you seem a little confused.  You seem a little confused.  So, uh, number three.  If you could step up to the box again.  Number three.  Up to the box.  Now, three and four.  Two hands.  Both of you. 
[02:35:00]  Yeah, that was the...  I think three and four were the ones that used the one-hand combo.  All right.  That might have caused the confusion.  Both hands.  All right.  Once again, it's down to three or four.  Get a good one.  Which one is Wendy's brother?  All right.  That's number three.  Did, uh, number three fill you up?  Yep.  All right.  And number four.  All right, Wendy.  For the meet and greet with Jim Brewer, which one was your brother?  Three. 
[02:35:30]  Yes!  Number three.  You called up your sister.  Time to show rules.  Oh.  Oh, my God.  How did you know it was three?  It was your sister.  Wendy.  She always does that.  Wendy, how'd you know?  Wendy, how did you know?  Um, really quick.  It was a real quick hand.  It was a four.  It was pretty quick, too.  Right.  And, uh, how was it filling up your sis? 
[02:36:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, how are they?  What do you think, though?  No, really?  Like, how did they feel?  No comment.  No comment?  No.  Did you like, like, as far as boobs go, if they weren't attached to your sister, would  they be nice?  Uh, I haven't even thought of it, and I don't want to think of it that way right now.  Why?  You got to.  No.  All right.  God, who is listening to this?  All right, hands down or pants now?  No.  If you guys make out, we'll give you tickets for Jay Moore. 
[02:36:30]  Rascals West Orange, Friday, Saturday, Sunday.  Love you, Jay, but no, thank you.  Well, how did that feel now, uh, with your brother's hands on your boobs?  They're not even looking at each other now.  They're pretty nice, though, right?  Dude, you got to fess up.  Take yourself out of it emotionally like you're a Vulcan.  We've seen your sister's boobs.  They're nice.  Yeah, they're nice.  Good for her.  Yeah, whip them out.  Let's see.  Take a look.  They're just breasts.  Look.  Look.  Take a look.  He will not turn around. 
[02:37:00]  They're nice.  He'll feel them, though.  He won't turn around and look.  Wow.  That rocks.  Dude, can you imagine the dreams both of them were going to have?  Oh, my God.  You guys already gave me torturous nightmares before, and now I'm doing it again.  Wow.  Oh, my God.  Every time I come on this show.  Unbelievable.  Thanks, guys.  You all right?  You all right now?  Yeah.  Yeah?  You felt up your sister, and all it cost us was a couple tickets. 
[02:37:30]  And a meet and greet.  Wait until Brewer finds out why he's meeting and greeting you.  You might ask for a live demonstration.  Wow.  As far as boobs, how many boobs have you touched?  A lot?  Oh, my God.  A few?  Oh, my God.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  You're married?  You're married.  What a great way to feel other people's boobs.  You just cheated with your sister.  You cheated with your sister, dude. 
[02:38:00]  What a great way to get around that loophole that you can't touch other boobs when you're  married.  Hey, it's my sister.  Can I break the news to your wife?  No.  Maybe she's giving a handy to her brother.  No, I'm kidding.  Now, stop.  Dude, he's a big guy.  Be careful.  I know.  Bob, what's up?  You guys are effing sick bastards.  Hey, we didn't touch our sister's boobs.  That's right.  The thing you guys do is unbelievable.  All right.  Thank you, Bob.  That's nice.  Let's bring in the incest couch. 
[02:38:30]  All right.  Oh, Jesus.  The incest couch.  I just hope Jeff doesn't call his wife by his sister's name.  James, what's up?  Guys, this guy is going right to hell.  Why?  Are you kidding me?  Oh, they're just boobs.  You know, in some countries, that's common.  He's married and he's filling up his sister.  And Rick, you can confirm that he filled up Wendy, his sister.  Yeah, not only once, but twice.  Yeah, twice.  Right to hell.  There's no coming back with this guy.  Rick, what type of technique did he use?  Was it the fingers up grab or the fingers underneath the bottom kind of bounce them a little? 
[02:39:00]  It was more like when you're sticking your hand into some place, you're not sure where  it's supposed to go.  So it was just kind of one hand.  Yeah.  And then he quickly grabbed so he wouldn't get bit by the snake and pulled out.  Pulled his hand out.  Right.  And they were nice, though, right?  Firm and...  All right.  Wonderful.  Let's go for the...  Wonderful.  See?  Let's go for the dirty Sanchez.  Oh, God damn.  Well, you guys got the backstage. 
[02:39:30]  Very good.  For Jim Brewer.  Yeah.  Wendy.  There you go.  Wendy and her brother on the O&A show.  Nice.  Thank you, guys.  Nice.  God damn it.  That rolled.  This show has just taken so many twists and turns into depravity.  Love it.  You fit right in.  Be proud.  You guys are no snow.  Be proud.  All right.  We've got to take a quick break.  We'll be back.  212-757-1027.  Look who's coming through the door, Anthony. 
[02:40:00]  Huh?  Reverend Al coming through the door, Anthony.  Oh, really?  I think he has some commentary on the Danny Glover, uh, blacks can't get cabs in New York.  Does he?  I believe so.  So...  Well, there's his music.  Well, there's his music.  And here he comes through the door, everyone.  Remember him?  Outraged.  I am outraged.  Outraged.  Way out of lesbians.  Who gives a crap about no taxi cab?  I can't believe that, that Okie from Muskogee wouldn't show a boobage. 
[02:40:30]  What the hell's going on?  I don't know.  And Rick sounds like a goddamn pervert, man.  Yeah, he sure does.  Rick's more disgusting than the movie.  Hey, Reverend Al, you want to see some white boobies?  Well, I like to stick to my black sisters.  Yeah.  But what the hell?  All right.  Since she's here.  All right.  Let's see some dairy.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, baby.  Reverend Al likes that.  That's why Reverend Al likes coming here.  There you go.  The O.B. and Anthony show.  But I'm outraged.  Now, what are you outraged about today? 
[02:41:00]  Why can't a black man get a taxi cab in New York City?  I don't know.  Our own black girl had trouble early in the program.  Yeah.  Even your Reverend Al has been turned down trying to get a taxi cab.  I can't get to dinner.  I'm outraged.  Reverend Al's got to be fed.  Stop that car, you towelhead.  I am starting my own taxi cab service for the community.  Oh, yeah? 
[02:41:30]  Reverend Al's black sea cab.  Service in the Bronx in Harlem and certain parts of Brooklyn.  Unlike your white cabs, Reverend Al's black sea cab will not be crown victorious.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  They are modified Bradley armored fighting vehicles.  That's right.  Where comfort abounds and they can take a few rounds.  When you get in, you get a message of safety from Reverend Al. 
[02:42:00]  Okay.  Welcome.  Buckle up and put on your complimentary flag jacket.  And remember, no shooting inside the vehicle due to ricochet.  Thank you.  Have a nice tip on Reverend Al's black sea cab.  See, the white folks cab is equipped with, what, ample trunk space.  Your Reverend Al's cab, twin 50-millimeter cannons with tracer rounds. 
[02:42:30]  And stinger anti-aircraft missiles.  To clear the way to your destination.  That's right.  Reverend Al's black sea cab, our motto,  The engine's loud and the pain is faded,  but sit back and relax where Alma played it.  So I'll be bringing those into the community very shortly  if you send your donations to Reverend Al  at the Apollo Theater in Harlem.  Thank you.  I am Al Ray.  All right, there he goes.  Reverend Al, everyone. 
[02:43:00]  Where's that Southern hick bitch?  Take your top off.  I am Al Ray.  There he goes.  Reverend Al.  Reverend Al.  Boy, he's angry.  He's a little angrier, Reverend Al.  I think he's more angry about the prude not getting top.  Who wouldn't be?  Okay.  That brings the races together, doesn't it?  It's good to know we can agree on something, right?  Absolutely.  All right. </pre>
