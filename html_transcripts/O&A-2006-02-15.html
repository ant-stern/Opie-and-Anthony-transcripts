<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a furious tirade against former friend and radio personality Scott Farrell, who had allegedly disparaged them on his new SiriusXM show and website, and even on Howard Stern's channel.  Opie recounted a heated phone call where he verbally attacked Farrell. The hosts, fueled by anger, detailed Farrell's perceived betrayal and dishonesty, launching into a barrage of vulgar insults, threats, and sexually explicit commentary directed at Farrell.  They described Farrell with derogatory terms like "faggot," "douchebag," and "pussy," and fabricated a violent scenario involving Opie physically assaulting Farrell.  The hosts repeatedly emphasized their listeners' – who they termed "pests" – active role in targeting and disrupting Farrell’s show, boasting about their impact.  Caller "Snatch Crud" contributed a remix about Farrell, further fueling the animosity. The segment also involved references to other radio personalities like Howard Stern, Jim Brewer, and Lynn Hoffman.


The intense Farrell segment continued, with the hosts, including Jimmy, engaging in a protracted, offensive exchange with callers often joining in the insults and vulgar storytelling. One caller recounted a bizarre encounter with a *Silence of the Lambs*-quoting driver, and another bragged about sleeping with multiple bridesmaids. The "Pharrella phone," a frequently disconnecting phone line, became a recurring motif, used derisively in reference to Farrell. The discussion veered into tangents about their relationships with other radio personalities, contrasting Farrell's actions with those they considered genuine friends.  Intended segments about Dick Cheney and "Club Soda Kenny" were largely preempted by the Farrell feud. The segment concluded with humorous comments about Opie's new haircut.


The show then shifted to Jim Norton's unconventional new haircut, which prompted humorous descriptions and speculation about its resemblance to various styles.  The focus then moved to "Club Soda Kenny," a West Orange police sergeant suspended for his offensive stand-up routine featuring jokes about bestiality and child molestation.  The hosts, along with several callers including retired and current police officers, debated the fairness of his suspension and potential First Amendment implications.  The discussion included speculation about the leaker of the comedy tapes and the legal ramifications. News reports were played, highlighting conflicting viewpoints and public reaction.  The hosts analyzed the news coverage, noting the downplaying of the severity of the jokes, and speculated on the reactions of personalities on *The View*.  The segment ended with audio of Dick Cheney's post-shooting outburst, followed by humorous commentary on the *New York Post*'s cartoonish depiction of the incident.


A further discussion of Dick Cheney’s hunting accident ensued, with the hosts joking about the absurdity of the situation and providing increasingly exaggerated versions of events. They incorporated Jon Stewart's commentary and updated the severity and location of the injuries sustained by the victim, Harry Whittington.  Speculation on Cheney's hunting license and parallels to the Iraq War were also made.  A listener then called to discuss the show's "pests," and another reported issues accessing show information via DirecTV. This was followed by a comedic segment involving a bottle of Jimmy's urine, generating gross-out humor.


A phone call with Scott and Cam from XM Canada followed, initially focusing on the Canadian Olympic hockey team's victory over Italy.  The conversation then shifted to other sports like curling, with humorous commentary on the attractiveness of female curlers.  Wayne Gretzky's gambling scandal was also discussed.  Finally, Francine, a staff member, brought in Valentine's Day gifts, triggering a long, detailed, and sexually explicit recounting of a workplace sexual fantasy involving a past coworker, Steve.  The hosts and Francine engaged in a graphic discussion, building the scenario step-by-step, focusing on the sexual details.


The show concluded with a phone interview with NASCAR driver Jimmy Johnson, primarily discussing the controversy surrounding his crew chief's penalty for a rear-window violation.  Johnson explained the technical aspects of the infraction, NASCAR's stricter enforcement, and his team's plans to overcome the penalty.  The conversation touched on the Daytona 500's 50th anniversary of Dale Earnhardt's death (highlighting improved safety measures), Kyle Busch's aggressive driving, potential rivalries, NASCAR's popularity, and the Chase format.  Listeners Doug Outdug, Mike from Arizona, and Brad from South Carolina called in to discuss bump drafting and its risks. The hosts also briefly discussed a $30,000 fine levied against another NASCAR driver for cursing on television.  Early in the segment, before the interview, the hosts engaged in unrelated banter, including a reference to a "grizzly man" and a picnic basket joke.

[00:05:30]  Rumor has it we traded Valentine's Day for President's Day.  Yeah.  Is that what we did?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, I don't know about you but I like pussy more than I like ex-presidents.

[00:07:00]  Unless you're Tom Cruise.  Amazing concept.  Just saying.  Oh, yeah.  Well, just saying.  Can I upload something real quick, you guys?  Huh?  I, uh, submitted a little, uh, remix, kind of a sleeper thing about, uh, Scott Farrell last night's Steve.  Oh, let's see.  I got some pretty good reviews on it on Whack Bag.  Ah.  What's your real name?  Uh, Darren?  Oh, it's right here.  I haven't even listened to it yet.  I like how the guys, uh, they preview it first.  Yeah.  In front of the Whack Bag crowd.  They preview it.  Uh, and depending on the reviews, they know whether they should submit it or not. 
[00:07:30]  Some people don't, uh, some people opt not to pay attention to the Whack Bag people if  they get bashed and send it in anyway.  Yeah.  Sometimes it flies, sometimes it doesn't.  So you're getting great reviews on this?  Yeah, I got a, I got a few pretty good ones.  Would you call it great reviews, good reviews, average reviews?  Average to good.  They were, they were nice.  How hard was the, how hard was the penis in the review meter?  That's for the porno movies, Opie.  Limp and then, uh, plump. 
[00:08:00]  Right.  And then fully wrecked.  How many penises is Whack Bag giving you on your piece of production?  What magazine used to do that?  Hustler, was it?  Yeah.  That's hysterical.  So a movie's got like four hard-ons.  Well, they would start, it would go from limp to fully erect.  Yeah.  Kind of go in like increments of.  They did it both ways, didn't they?  Yeah.  They had a lot of penises, one through five, and then they had the limp to hard penis.  The limp, Jay.  So what'd you get from Whack Bag, would you say, in the, if this was porno?  I would have to say a, uh, a pretty good chub with a kink in the middle. 
[00:08:30]  A pretty good chub with a kink in the middle.  Yeah.  All right.  Uh, so this is your Scott Farrell sweeper.  Yeah.  It's, uh, something you guys, if it's good enough for you, you guys can use it to go into  commercial break when you guys are beating up another host.  Well, we're going to, uh, we're going to give you some reviews right now.  We haven't heard this.  We're going to play it.  And then the listeners could call up and either kill you or, or praise you today.  All right.  That's what we do.  Hammering or the praising.  And I'm, I'm trying to, uh, vie for the position of a propaganda minister out here in the 
[00:09:00]  Vegas area of, uh, Doug out Dougal.  Yeah.  By the way, Scott Farrell finding out that the pests are no joke.  I love these stupid radio shows out there.  They're like, Oh, the O and a army.  Bring it on boys.  They have no idea what they're getting into with the pests from this radio program.  Yeah.  They're like, Oh, they got a little army.  Isn't that cute?  It's not like an army where other shows say, Hey, you got the army, uh, send in your,  uh, email address.  We're going to, uh, uh, uh, send you an email, a newsletter and a bumper sticker. 
[00:09:30]  That's not the, this army is, is mobilized.  They're active.  They're proactive.  And they are fucking ruthless.  Absolutely ruthless.  And they don't let go.  Nope.  They're called pests more than the army.  There's some, there's an O and a army.  And then there's like O and a pest.  Yeah.  And then, huh?  We're full on shock troops.  That's what we are.  The pests are the elite, uh, forces of the O and a army. 
[00:10:00]  Right.  And, uh, just, uh, just to reiterate here, Scott Farrell used to be a friend of the program.  He's a complete and utter asshole.  I don't want anything to do with him whatsoever.  No matter that, he's trying to, um, uh, behind the scenes, get some kind of truce going.  Right.  Because, uh, the pests are destroying his show.  They destroyed his little tryout on Howard Stern's, uh, channel over there.  Yeah.  And, uh, we already found out that the little doggy company very pissed off at Scott Farrell.  Yeah.  Howard very pissed off at Scott Farrell because his little show on, uh, Howard 100. 
[00:10:30]  Howard 100.  Whatever he's calling it over there.  He'll name the channel after himself, yeah.  And I'm saying whatever because I, I swear to you, I haven't listened to, uh, the little  doggy company.  I just get reports from the past and other people around here.  And, um, what was I going to say?  Oh, it turned out to be a three hour infomercial for the Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah.  So he pissed off a lot of people over there.  That's got to make him happy over there at Sirius.  Make Howard happy that three hours of his, uh, uh, time block on his channel that has 
[00:11:00]  his name on it is, uh, yeah, an infomercial for the Opie and Anthony show.  Right.  And, uh, when he fails miserably over there, he's not coming back into our camp ever.  Bye bye.  And say you don't care as much as you want.  You know something?  When, when all the doors are being slammed in this guy's face, like they are every, every  six months, the guy can't hold a fucking job.  He's never been able to hold a job.  Look, I'm not going to lie to you.  I liked the guy.  I thought he did some good radio.  Uh, but the deal is the guy is a traitor and he's no good. 
[00:11:30]  Lying sack of shit.  And he could add me to the list of many, many, many, many names where he just burned  bridges.  Oh yeah.  His career is filled with, uh, people where he just burned bridges.  Yep.  And now Scott Farrell, add me to the fucking list.  Go fuck yourself.  This fucking guy.  And let me tell you, because there's rumors about this.  I was sitting home the other night.  I think it was Monday watching, uh, something faggoty.  It was, uh, I think it was skating with celebrities or something. 
[00:12:00]  Okay.  Ooh.  How many, how many dicks up?  No.  I got hooked on that dumb show.  Cause it got, cause I can't believe Bruce Jenner is actually skating.  He looks like a Frankenstein out there and week after week they, they allow him to continue  for some reason.  So I'm just, I'm just, I don't know.  I'm into this stupid show.  It's, it happens.  What can I tell you?  And also my phone rings and it says something like six, nine, nine or six, nine, nine, nine.  I'm like, what the fuck is this?  Right?  So I answered the phone.  It's Scott Farrell.  And it's obvious. 
[00:12:30]  Uh, he's calling me live from, uh, the little doggy company.  And I'm like, this guy who, who claims to be my friend who, who, uh, had the same agent  as us for a long time.  We, we sat and talked, we ate together.  He's going to make me part of his fucking radio show and try to make a bit out of this.  Yeah, dude, I lost my fucking mind.  And this is what I'm telling you.  This is the God's honest truth.  We try to, uh, deal in honesty on this program.  I lost my mind for at least three minutes and just beat the shit out of him. 
[00:13:00]  Okay.  And then it turns out that I guess he, uh, he didn't air the call or he dumped out like  crazy and then goes on his show and says, Oh, I tried to get Opie on the air, but he didn't  want to play.  He didn't want anything to do with me or something like that.  I'm like, I made you look like a little bitch.  Like you pussied out or something.  Because this is the real deal.  I mean, we're talking about real anger here.  I'm like, you're going to make me part of a fucking radio bit.  Yeah.  You fucking cocksucker.  I just lost my mind, lost my mind. 
[00:13:30]  Yeah.  And I got all the facts out.  But of course, because they don't, they don't, uh, you know, deal with real issues over there.  Oh, we better dump out of this or we better not air this because this is too brutal.  But the fact is Scott Farrell on his fucking website, I don't give a shit.  He's trying to say that someone else wrote it, but Scott Farrell on his website started  praising Howard out of nowhere, even though he's been a friend of ours for many years.  I helped him get the fucking job at the old joint.  Heard him just bash Howard, uh, all the time to us.  I got him the job at the, uh, the old joint or at least helped him out because I know his 
[00:14:00]  history with burning bridges.  But I'm like, no, the guy's talented.  We got to give him a shot.  Yep.  And then we became friends and he ended up getting fired from the old job.  And this is the real deal because he defended Anthony and I.  Okay.  He defended Anthony and I.  He couldn't keep his mouth shut.  All right.  That's fine.  All right.  So all of a sudden I know where he's got this website and it says, uh, he starts trashing  us and saying how great Howard is and Howard's going to kick our ass.  I'm like, where the fuck is this coming from?  We were negotiating with the guy to try to get him over here, uh, to XM. 
[00:14:30]  But, but because of things that are going on behind the scenes, we had to put all that  on hold.  That's why some other people that we really like, and you guys have heard on the show, they're  in a holding pattern right now.  Okay.  But we're trying to figure that out.  And then next thing you know, uh, he's, he's, uh, he's on Howard's show, trashing us  and then starts his own show.  It's a little trial over there and, and starts killing us there.  So the pest just took him out.  That's it.  Took him out two nights in a row.  Out of his game. 
[00:15:00]  And it doesn't stop people.  This doesn't stop.  The pests go and go and go until, uh, until you give up till you just give up or until  how he realizes, uh, this ain't going to work out.  Uh, get somebody else in there.  Right.  And his only defense is like, I didn't write that on my own message board.  I'm like, well, really?  Who did then, Scott?  It says, it's pretty much your website.  Not only that, it was worded like forever.  It's like somebody writing, um, uh, uh, like somebody reading, uh, one of Jimmy's blogs 
[00:15:30]  and then saying, well, Jimmy didn't write that.  You'd know if he wrote it.  It sounds like Jimmy.  And I'm not a faggot.  If I write something on my site, I'm not going to deny it.  Um, I'm not a little faggot like that.  And here's the deal, man.  I mean, there are times, there's some things that pop up on our website that I'm like,  what?  What is that about?  And I, and we immediately take care of the problem.  Yeah.  Take it down.  Address it.  Like he didn't know it was up there for days.  Yeah.  For days.  And then to get on and confirm it by just bashing us. 
[00:16:00]  Fuck him.  And then he calls me, he calls me thinking he's got what it takes to take me on.  Stop.  And then doesn't even have the balls to air the phone call and then make believe that  I didn't want any part of him.  Are you kidding me, Scott Farrell?  You fucking loser.  You fucking liar.  You fucking traitor.  I don't think he was trying to make a bit out of you.  I think he was trying to squash it.  And when you told him to go fuck himself, he realized I can't squash this.  He was trying to squash it and save his dignity.  Oh, believe me.  He was trying to save his dignity and squash it.  Yeah.  He wants it squashed.  It's affecting his show here. 
[00:16:30]  And a note to another old friend, Jeremy Coleman, because he listens every fucking day.  If Scott Farrell calls me at home again and tries to make me some part of a fucking radio  bit or gives out any of my fucking phone numbers on the show, everyone's home number  gets out on the show.  Everyone's.  Yeah.  Everyone's.  And Jeremy, you know the list of people over there that I know and I have numbers for,  including Howard.  All of them.  Yep.  I ain't fucking around.  This fucking guy calls me to try to make me a radio bit. 
[00:17:00]  Go fuck yourself.  And that's the real story because people have heard rumors.  What?  I hope he didn't want to.  No, I took him on.  Trust me.  And I made him look stupid.  He just chose not his own show.  Not to air that.  He was.  But he was obviously like Jimmy thinks he was trying to squash some.  No, this guy was obviously either taping or I was in a long delay and said, all right,  I can't go with this.  I'm telling you.  He might have been taping it.  I'm telling you because I've had conversations with the guy.  They don't start off with a, you know, a blast to the face where I'm like, what the 
[00:17:30]  fuck?  And then I realized, like, oh, I'm on the air.  All right.  You want to play?  We're going to play.  Yeah.  Let's go to Doug out, Doug.  Doug, what's up?  Oh, wait.  Here it is.  Holy shit.  Hold on, Doug.  One of the senior members of the test.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold.  Hold.  Hold.  Hold.  Doug, hold on, man.  By the way, you guys did a great job.  Hold on.  So this is what he said on his show to back it up.  I can't believe you just called him. 
[00:18:00]  That takes a big man to do something like that, you know?  They wouldn't have picked up the phone to call.  Well, of course not, because they do it on the air.  So I called him and said, let's hook up and talk about it.  He actually kind of, but he doesn't want to, he doesn't want to talk about it.  He wants to have all his little faggot friends stand up for him.  All right.  He's not man enough to hook up with me and talk about it one-on-one, just the two of us.  I've known him for, you know, 10 years.  I'm cool with him, and he's afraid to meet me in public.  Holy shit.  First of all, I've only known him for about four or five years, not 10 years, and I didn't 
[00:18:30]  hang up on him.  No.  He didn't know what the hell to do with this, so he's like, oh, I'll call you later.  Like, just trying to get out of the phone call.  He's a fucking faggot.  I'll meet you for lunch.  He's afraid to look me in the eye one-on-one and tell me all this shit in my face, and it's  true.  And so is his little pussy partner, and so is his other little pussy partner.  And I've asked him a million times what the deal is, and they want to threaten my wife  and son.  Oh.  What?  I'll threaten your-  Who the fuck threaten your wife and your son?  No one's threatening that fucking hole you dump a load into, you drunken fucking junkie. 
[00:19:00]  No one cares about your fucking wife and your fucking son.  No one cares about them.  That's why you're so desperate to get a job, because you're a middle-aged failure, and you  got to fucking feed the kid, and you got to put fucking food in her fat mouth.  That's why you're sucking dick over there, so you can get a new job, so you can fucking  finally act like a responsible adult.  Fuck you, you doe-eyed cocksucker traitor.  I'll threaten your face right to your face.  Ugh.  I'll threaten your cop.  You know where I am right now.  Come on. 
[00:19:30]  These fucking phonies that-  With the threats, and I'm gonna beat you up.  You know, you really should do your research before you start saying shit like that.  The tough guy, from what I've heard, he's had his ass kicked for mouthing off more times  than I can count.  But what is that?  I'll meet you outside.  You want to have a fucking charity wrestling match, you fucking zoo crew jerk-off?  You middle-aged zoo crew jerk-off.  Yeah, Bubba the Love Sponge, he's like, I'll meet you in the octagon.  Oh, fuck you.  The octagon.  No, continue with your fake stupid radio, with your fake voices, and we'll stay over here 
[00:20:00]  and do our real shit.  Meet you in the playground.  I'll meet you in an octagon.  The octagon.  We'll put the gloves on.  Will we?  We're gonna put gloves on.  Who's gonna tap out?  And what, are we gonna, like, raise money for a charity, you faggot?  Really, man, before you start threatening us, you really should do your research.  Thunder lips.  You wouldn't be threatening, trust me.  The thunder lips and the Italian stallion.  Look up, you know where I am right now.  Come on down on your little faggot roller skates. 
[00:20:30]  I'll beat your head in.  Come on down right now.  I'm here right now.  You know where I'm at.  Come find me.  I call you up.  You want to scream and yell on the phone?  Call you out.  By the way, that is, like, the bravest thing to ever say, because,  we've been to the Little Doggy Company.  They're on the, I think it's close to 50 stories up.  Yeah, I'll just go there.  I'll go there, Scott.  Because after 9-11, they just let you up.  Yeah.  Yeah.  There's no security.  I'll go right to the security guard down below.  I'm here to see Scott Farrell to punch him in the face. 
[00:21:00]  Yeah, we've got to beat up Scott.  Yeah, one moment, please.  As you're in the elevator.  Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.  More phony shit.  I love these guys.  You know where I am.  Really?  Oh, I'm going to get from the security guy, and he's going to allow me to go 50 stories  up to punch you in the face, right?  Yeah.  That's going to happen, right?  Right.  We can't even fucking sign into our own building half the time.  Just go down there.  Get on the Pharrell-evator.  Come on up. 
[00:21:30]  Oh, shut up.  Oh, with the words Pharrell and things.  It's fucking...  When I listen to him trashing the show and me and you guys, I swear to God, I wasn't  even that angry.  I was fucking embarrassed for him.  It's like, that's what you have?  I'll come down, and I'll fucking put you in a headlock?  You fucking cunt.  You phony fucking cunt.  That's what you are.  You're a fucking phony cunt.  You don't even have the balls, to be honest, man.  That's your idea of cutting and slicing somebody's Achilles, you fucking Mr. Mom faggot? 
[00:22:00]  You're a Mr. Mom.  You're a stay-at-home mom.  You do your fucking little radio show at night, and then you go home, and you fuck your stupid  wife, and you change diapers in the morning, and you're still trying to be a rebel wearing  a duster like it's 1981.  You stink.  Gets on the air talking about, yeah, chicks.  Yeah, yeah.  Not boozing it up last night.  No, you're not.  Let me make this perfectly clear.  None of us have threatened his wife or his kids.  I haven't even talked about them.  Who cares about them?  I don't care. 
[00:22:30]  It's not my fault.  You didn't have the guts to pull out of some stripper you were fucking.  Good for you.  Now you got a kid.  Fuck you.  Who cares?  Your wife and kid haven't been stabbing us in the back or talking shit about us, so why  should we address them?  It's you that's the asshole, Pharrell.  How desperate were you, man?  I mean, Jim Brewer went over there, and we're still friends.  No problem with Jim Brewer.  He went over there.  He thought it was a good opportunity, and he doesn't fucking trash us.  He does his show.  It's nothing about working for serious.  And when we see him out and about, yeah, we're friendly. 
[00:23:00]  Yeah.  We are, to be honest with you.  We don't see him a lot these days, but when we do, there's no problems there.  No.  And you could have done the same fucking thing, but for some reason you felt like, because  now you got the gig over there, you got to trash us on your own fucking website.  Go on Howard and trash us.  Yeah.  So now deal with the pest.  You thought they were cute.  I love these guys.  Oh, bring it on.  Bring on those two army members.  They got only two listeners.  It takes one day.  You don't want to fuck with the pest.  We've been telling you guys this for, I don't know, a year or two now. 
[00:23:30]  It takes a day before they start going, all right, we got to do something about this.  It's destroying the show.  He has no fucking fans, dude.  It was all Opie and Anthony calls.  I listened to 30 minutes of calls.  It was hilarious.  No fucking, they're not pre-screened callers.  He has no fans.  No one gives a shit about you.  No one cares about the rambling guy.  No one's listening.  No one fucking cares.  I call you up.  You want to scream and yell on the phone and fight with me on the phone and scream and  yell and call me all kinds of nans and cuss at me and call me this and that. 
[00:24:00]  I'm like, let's just hook up and talk it out and figure.  See, he's referring to the phone call there, by the way.  You didn't call.  But he's referring to the call when he got me on the air.  Yep.  See?  But I didn't want to deal with you.  I beat you up pretty good.  Yeah.  As far as phone calls go, pal.  Let's sit down and have lunch and work it out.  And figure it out.  Oh, yeah.  That's going to happen.  Instead, I get all these gay, stupid radio games that they play.  Yeah, but you're just peeing right into it.  Millions of these stupid faggots. 
[00:24:30]  By the way, let me tell you something about the whole this, uh, what's her name?  Liz or something?  Lynn Hoffman.  Or Lynn Hoffman.  She fucking came here, kissed our ass, and got pictures with all of us.  Yeah.  That is a fact.  Who wants to fucking back me up on this?  She said that on the air.  Huh?  She said that on the air.  She said, I went over there to tell those guys that they were great.  This is why I hate just about everyone on radio.  Because they're a bunch of fucking phonies.  There's a reason why we're successful.  Because people see that we're trying to do real shit over here.  Like, you come up. 
[00:25:00]  I think she was trying to get a job, or she was just being cool.  Steve.  Steve knows.  Lynn Hoffman.  What's her deal?  She was, uh, she was one of the replacement morning shows at NAW.  After we got fired, right?  Yeah.  And then she came up here and got pictures with all of us.  What was that about?  She's fans of the show or something, right?  Yeah, but she, and she maintained that while she was in it.  And she was also hoping that maybe XM or we would hire her.  Yeah.  But we just don't go down the whole route.  No, she was, she was very cool when she came up.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Huh?  Grr. 
[00:25:30]  You done?  Um.  Oh, you got a phone call there, Steve.  Stupid.  Someone's calling us, Steve.  No, she was, she was cool when that came up.  Your Pharrell phone's ringing.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  It's like telephone board Pharrell on it.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Blah.  Fucking faggot.  Ugh.  You want to wrestle?  We'll put on war paint and wrestle.  Douchebag.  What a fucking douchebag.  Listeners attack me.  It's fine.  Keep calling.  I'm, you know, you can't stop me.  I keep going to the bank.  Ugh.  Keep calling.  Call all night.  Call every night. 
[00:26:00]  What?  I live for it.  Dude, can I please, for one second, here's how you know you're fucking getting your fucking  head handed to you by a bunch of callers when you start mentioning how much money you  make.  When you have to resort to, I'm laughing all the way to the bank, you are getting the dog  shit kicked out of you because you have no callers that are supporting you.  And that's where you gotta go.  And Scott, you're being awfully cocky considering you don't even have the gig yet.  Yeah.  You think the little doggy company's gonna want to deal with you doing a show over there  with our fans taking over your show night after night after night?  They're relentless. 
[00:26:30]  So you only have, like, you only have actually one option, to attempt to do a talk show without  taking any phone calls.  Or to set up phone calls, because we know they do that over there.  Yep.  Good luck to you.  Good fucking luck.  Because you got under my skin, all of our skins, so congratulations on that.  But now Payback's gonna be a bitch.  Yep.  Enjoy the ONA PES.  Because they're not going away anytime soon.  They do not leave.  Call every night.  I live for it.  In fact, I can give you his cell phone number right now.  He can't even dance with me.  I called him, I tried to be cool with him, but he won't talk. 
[00:27:00]  Once again, because she's now, she's gonna play?  She's gonna play?  She's hinting that she's gonna give out my cell phone?  No, his cell phone.  Huh?  His cell phone.  Was that what she said?  I gave him your cell phone, meaning Scott's cell phone.  I think she's trying to fucking get out of this.  I don't think she wants any part of it.  No, no.  I think she has a radio gig.  She's happy, and she likes you guys, and she's gotta deal with this fucking scumbag,  and she's panicky.  Listen to it again.  I could be wrong.  All right, well.  It sounds like she's fucking panicking about, she's like trying to be funny, like, hey,  I gave out your cell phone number, meaning his. 
[00:27:30]  If anyone knows that I'm the real deal, it's Jeremy Coleman.  So Jeremy, if he continues to make me a cute radio bit and call me at home, or he gives  out any of my personal info, oh, I see the future.  You will be fired for what I do.  I have everyone's fucking phone numbers.  Everyone.  But if you want to play that game, then we will play that game.  Collect it over the years.  Mark my fucking word on this.  I live for it.  In fact, I can give you a cell phone number right now.  I call him. 
[00:28:00]  I try to be cool with him.  He won't talk to me.  He's supposed to scream and yell and call me names.  By the way, once again, because he's referring to the phone call, he was not, and I'm telling  you, he was not trying to be cool.  No.  He was either taping something for the show, or I was on the show, and they dumped out.  I don't know.  I really don't know that part.  He went right at me.  Not like, hey, dude, it's got, you know, look, all awkward.  You know how if you want to try to work something out with somebody, it's all awkward?  Yeah, he just came out.  No, it was full-on attack. 
[00:28:30]  There was nothing about trying to work shit out.  He was trying to be cocky, thinking he could take me on, realize, oh, fuck, I'm getting  my head handed to me here.  I better just hang up.  And that's what he did.  Yep.  Beam and yell and call me names.  And I'm like, come down and call me names to my face, tough guy.  I'm right down there.  I can't even get you.  He's like, come on my show and let us have a bunch of bad comedians attack you.  By the way, I did say that, and I said that like over, probably a month ago.  We have a huge radio audience. 
[00:29:00]  Yeah.  No show at the Little Doggy Company, including Howard, has an audience as big as ours.  That is a fact.  Nope.  Okay.  So I go, if you're such a tough guy and you're brave, you call up the show and we'll discuss  this.  I'm not calling your show to discuss a problem I'm having with you.  You know, you call us.  ...attack you.  Why don't you come outside and talk to me to my face?  Why don't you meet up with me, tough guy, and talk it over? 
[00:29:30]  Instead.  It's a bit silly.  It's radio.  What are we, fighters or something?  What are you guys, boxers?  Shut up.  Shut up, you hole.  Now you're just another hole.  She's goofing on him.  How does that feel?  She goes, what, are we fighters?  What, are we going to go out and fight?  Dude, she just wants to go do a radio show and she is stuck with this self-destructive,  bootlicking piece of shit.  Combative asshole.  We are embarrassed for you, man, that you have to suck.  I can see if this show fucked him over and he was fucking striking back, but it's like  you're groveling for the approval over there.  Like, ah, I'll take our own name. 
[00:30:00]  I'll make a name for myself over here.  Yeah.  Pick up the Pharrellaphone.  We never said no to the guy.  We were still trying to work things out.  He's just a douche.  We were trying to work things out, but, you know, he decided to go over there.  God bless you, but you also decided to trash us for whatever reason.  Now you're going to pay for that.  Here's how you know he's a fucking coward and a fraud.  The fact that when referring to Jeremy Coleman, if you want to refer to Jeremy Coleman, he's  a good guy.  Yeah, when he's on Howard's show, he goes, he's Jeremy Coleman.  He's a great guy.  I really look up to him.  Do you?  You look up to him, you fucking phony.  Did anyone look up to Jeremy Coleman? 
[00:30:30]  He was a good guy, but we walked all over him.  Well, no one looked up to him.  The whole fucking staff walked all over him.  No one looked up to him.  It's a fact.  Scott, you know that.  Jeremy even knows that.  Scott's a phony.  Everything he says is self-serving.  He's trying to make something of himself, and it's usually bullshit.  You know, and there are times you've got a bad reputation.  What can I tell you?  But on this one, I'm telling you, this guy has burned so many bridges, and I'm just throwing  my name at the bottom of the list of bridges that Scott Farrell burned. 
[00:31:00]  Yep.  It's a known fact in the business.  It's the guy that blows himself up all the time.  All the time.  Because I've had the reputation of blowing myself up.  I'm like, really?  Really?  Look at the Scott Farrell's career.  I look like a saint.  Doug out, Doug.  What's up?  Shake it up.  What's up, Doug?  He sucks ass.  He completely sucks.  But I've got to back up Jimmy and say flat out, that hole was not your average hole. 
[00:31:30]  She definitely was getting pissed at Scott for not being able to handle the situation.  She, I really, truly think that we can get her to quit before we can get him off the air.  Ah, you think so?  But yeah, man, we got all the audio in there.  There's a really good one of him having about a two minute meltdown.  I don't know if they put that one on the CD for you.  But he is, he was completely losing it by midway through night two.  He was losing his fucking mind. 
[00:32:00]  When was night two?  Was that last night?  No, night two was actually Monday night.  Okay.  Monday night.  Yeah, I believe they did Friday, Monday, and last night.  He has nothing.  And he went back to the same old, you have no listeners.  Enough with the no listeners, you idiots.  You're sending your listeners over to me.  I got news for you.  None of us are paying for Sirius.  We got our ways to listen.  You're not getting a fucking dime. 
[00:32:30]  And what we're doing is we're going to single handedly destroy your fucking radio show.  And we're going to try to bring down an entire radio company and then take credit for it.  And let me say something about what a fucking pussy this guy is.  You call people pussies and hand me outside and we'll fucking wrestle.  We'll alarm wrestle and we'll have an omelet.  You fucking cunt.  You dumped out of calls.  He was told to dump out of calls and he dumped out of calls.  I don't want to give you a free commercial.  Here's a free commercial.  Scott Ferrell is on Sirius.  Scott Ferrell is on Sirius. 
[00:33:00]  Scott Ferrell is on Sirius.  I don't give a fuck who goes and listens to you.  You fucking middle-aged cornball.  You fucking cornball.  You long jacket.  Whoa, this guy don't take no prisoners.  Whoa, this guy.  This guy's fucking heavy metal personified, man.  You fucking douchebag.  No one threatened your wife.  No one.  The fucking pests didn't do it either.  Why?  There's one reason why.  Do you not understand?  We are hundreds of fucking attention whores that just want to get our name on a show. 
[00:33:30]  How the fuck do we get our name on a show and be attention whores if you're calling your fucking house and threatening your wife and fucking kid?  Get over yourself, jackass.  And he knows nobody threatened his wife and fucking kid.  I feel bad for his wife and kid.  She actually has to look at you and go, this is the guy I've chosen to live with.  This is the fucking guy, this self-destructive fucking bridge-burning cunt who dumps out of calls on a satellite radio.  Why do you dump on a satellite show? 
[00:34:00]  Yeah.  You 20-minute take-a-break pussy.  It's a fucking commercial radio show.  Because they're getting the best of them.  I asked them that two calls in a row.  I wonder if you guys have that on the tape there.  Because not only do we call the show, not only do we assault the show, but after the show, we edit the audio into playable chunks on your show.  These guys are hysterical.  I'm telling you, man.  To the newbies out there, I don't want to fuck with the ONA pest.  No.  We created this monster and we don't even know how to stop it anymore.  And they're getting smarter, by the way.  They're using technology. 
[00:34:30]  When the pest thing started with us, it was a little scary because we're like, oh, my God, our own fans are going to blow up our show.  Yeah.  But we've been through some rough patches, right, Doug?  Oh, yeah.  And now we're learning from our mistakes and we're just getting more and more, you know, intelligent here.  But we've got a great tool now that we've never really had in the past and it really showed the past couple of nights.  Look on your pal talk screen, fellas.  Because we've got women pests who get right through the fucking screeners every time. 
[00:35:00]  Yep.  They don't even scrutinize the women.  I'm telling you, this show is just, I don't know, it's like a lifestyle.  I mean, we do a radio show four hours a day, but these guys continue the Opie and Anthony experience, I guess we'll call it, all day long.  Yeah.  Like, there is so much stuff that happened on Pal Talk the last two days that we could do a week of radio on.  A week!  Like, yeah, after the show's over, it goes to the computers and everything carries on.  And some of the stuff they're doing on Pal Talk is funnier than anything we could do on the actual radio show. 
[00:35:30]  Hysterical.  You know, and now they're, you know, now thanks to my brother's restaurant, now they've got a place to hang.  I'm telling you, it's a whole lifestyle thing that is happening here.  So, Doug, thank you.  And they're ruthless.  Thanks, Doug.  Ruthless.  It's all about Pal Talk for Opie and Anthony.  Whackbag.com is simply the best fan site out there.  And whether or not you guys give it to us or not, check out Pest Radio tonight, 7 p.m. on Howard 101. 
[00:36:00]  Pest Radio.  And, Doug, keep your eye on the prize, by the way.  We are on.  Because it's all about Howard in the end, trust me.  He's the little manipulator behind the scenes.  This is almost like Khan in Star Trek II.  We haven't killed Howard yet.  We've hurt him.  And we wish to go on hurting him.  I think that's my outline.  Very good, Khan.  See you, bro.  Very good phone call, by the way.  Just, yeah, leave now. 
[00:36:30]  Tubes or something.  Oh, 007, Rhode Island, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Good morning.  Good morning.  I'm Tubes on Pal Talk.  I got in a good Ramon.  I guess it's being dubbed the second night.  Oh, really?  And, yeah, he absolutely was losing it.  He took a break about 10 minutes into the show.  Then another break about 20 minutes into the show.  He didn't know what to do because he had to keep dumping.  Yep.  All the calls, every single call with us.  And how about this?  Any Pharrell fans that want to call?  Call.  Call.  You're not going to get dumped out of?  Have fun. 
[00:37:00]  Here's what you have to do.  You've got to be smart about it.  You can't just call up and just start screaming Ramon because then he can dump it.  You've got to involve him.  You've got to engage him into a conversation.  Yeah, just tell him how great he is.  Yeah.  That always helps with other radio personalities.  He loves those calls.  And you know what else he likes to do, too?  He's so nervous at this point that any time you open your mouth, he jumps right in and  talks over you.  He doesn't want to let you speak at all.  There were a couple of legitimate callers during this whole thing, and he was cutting them  off, wasn't letting them talk, hanging up because he was afraid they were pests. 
[00:37:30]  He was absolutely on the edge.  He was all paranoid.  Absolutely on the edge.  Hysterical.  Good job to the pests.  We've had some awesome nights in there.  And I missed last night, but I'll be back in tonight.  All right, cool.  Thank you, 007.  No problem.  All right.  I heard the first hour last night on the Pal Talk, and he had Howard on the first break,  and then he did some other shit.  He took some pre...  You could tell there were pre-screen calls because he's like, yeah, I think I partied  with this guy.  And he fucking went to...  I think I partied with this guy, and it's a guy I partied with?  Oh, you fucking douche.  Dude, he's such a rebel.  Dude, this is... 
[00:38:00]  Such a rebel.  You gotta be honest.  You know what?  He really is a fucking...  He's fucking crazy.  I can't believe we're on his shit list.  He plays the fucking bong sound.  Oh, wow.  The fucking bong sound, you hack.  That's a good one.  Hey, but just a bunch of guys smoking a dube.  Get the Pharrella bong out.  We get Pharrella stoned.  What a fucking Pharrella douche.  More audio.  Anyway, I love Chicago.  Great city. 
[00:38:30]  I do Man Cow Show, too.  I got enemies for that, too.  I get death threats because I do Man Cow.  They get mad at me when I make money with Man Cow.  I get mad.  I get enemies that make fun of me whenever I take...  When I take a job now, I get everybody critiques whether or not I should have a job.  What the fuck is she doing going over there to series?  We're not going to tolerate that shit.  Hey, you.  Stay unemployed over there and be a bum, goddammit.  Why does everyone hate you?  That's not what we're saying.  That isn't the point, idiot.  You didn't have to go over there and trash us if we were supposedly friends, Scott. 
[00:39:00]  You want a job over there?  That's what it's about.  You don't get...  Fine.  Who cares if you take a job over there?  That wasn't the issue.  The issue is you went over there, mouth open, spewing out bad shit about us and accepting  our enemy's dick in your mouth.  And because he was trying to get everybody over there to...  He's trying to land with a splash.  Right.  That's what he's trying to do.  He's trying to let people...  He wants people to walk and go, geez, that's that fucking crazy guy.  Ooh, look out when he comes down the hallway.  Jesus, you don't want to be on his shit list.  Yes, we do.  You're a fucking... 
[00:39:30]  You're a hoax and a fraud.  And you know what?  He said when I was on his show, he sucked.  Then why did you laugh?  This is...  I hate a fucking fraud.  Yeah.  Stop.  Just don't lie, man.  You're embarrassing yourself.  Just fucking tell the truth.  I don't hate you.  Because I'm so pretty.  Well...  Jimmy in Wyoming.  Because I end up with all the hot-looking trim anyway, and it bothers people that have  ugly girlfriends.  Jimmy in Wyoming?  I know some guys who do radio shows that have ugly girlfriends.  Anyway, Jimmy, go ahead.  Hey, Scott.  Did I see you over at FH Riley's the other night? 
[00:40:00]  I think I was, and I was sleeping with my boss.  Hey, Lim.  Yeah.  Hey, I'm a black ninja, baby.  Whatever, dude.  Ah, stupid.  They all get show references in.  And thanks for the plug for my brother's restaurant.  Isn't that great?  400 New York Avenue, Huntington.  It's FH Riley's.  There's nothing better than when this fucking jack-off thinks somebody likes him, and it  turns out they're fucking doing a pest call.  Yep.  Ah, yeah.  Thanks a lot.  Oh, fuck you, jerk-off.  Mark in Massachusetts, what's happening? 
[00:40:30]  He found his wife in bed with two guys getting deep-sixed.  No, he didn't.  Yeah, it was fucking ridiculous, man.  I saw these two guys fucking playing this game called Monster Rain with my wife, and holy  shit, it was awful.  God, what would you do?  I mean, you left her, right?  Yeah, well, I left her because little Jimmy told me to after, uh...  I believe that.  Anyway...  Oh, God!  Oh, God!  I believe it.  That tool gets no trim at all, because he looks like fucking Adolf Hitler.  Mo in Boston. 
[00:41:00]  You don't want to look like a total tool every day of your life, like Dracula and shit.  No chick will do you if you're four foot tall and you're fucking ugly.  Hold on.  What was that?  I don't know, but that was some pretty fucking vicious audio there.  I look like a tool, and no chick will do me.  Let me tell you something.  Who got more pussy than Dracula?  Exactly.  Dracula was like the guy.  He'd just look into your eyes, and the chicks were melting.  And it was great, because after he fucked you, you were dead.  How perfect is that? 
[00:41:30]  Jesus.  Ah, four foot tall.  Oh, no.  A short joke?  You fucking hack?  Play a bong sound.  Gonna blow smoke in his face.  Hey, Pharrell, I'm listening in Joliet, Illinois.  Ah, pick up the Pharrellaphone.  Ugh.  People were saying, you know, oh, you shouldn't give me attention, because the pestilence,  listen, and hey, they might like the guy.  Good.  That's always the rule in these kind of things.  You don't want to send listeners over there.  This is one of those cases where he's just so bad. 
[00:42:00]  And a lot of people have pointed out, I never would have listened to him if it wasn't for  this going on.  I listened and realized he's just babbling.  If it wasn't for his fast, like, on fucking meth delivery, he's saying nothing.  Nothing.  He's babbling like an idiot the whole time.  Well, here's where he goes off on Norton.  Barry in Colorado.  Isn't it great when I get them on and they're just such dicks that I still do them and I'm 
[00:42:30]  not even trying.  I'm like, are you such a caterer?  But I think I'm going to yell you on the radio because I'm a total dork.  I'm a total dork.  This is his whole show, by the way.  Thank you, Pest.  Oh, wait a minute.  That's their reception.  That's satellite company.  Nothing comes in.  Sorry.  See ya.  Dude, that's not me.  I'm cool.  I'm cool.  I know you're cool.  I'm not going to hurt you.  Take the knife back, Lynn.  Sorry, man.  I got a question for Lynn because, you know, I'm used to just hearing Pharrell.  I don't know.  I mean, you've got to calm down. 
[00:43:00]  I mean, because if you don't, you're not going to be able to hear him by February 24th and  25th in Albany, Jim Norton.  I know.  He doesn't talk any faster.  He doesn't talk any faster than you.  Let me just say this.  That's a plug.  First of all, he's more funny, if you will, than they are.  I've only felt that he's gotten bigger than they have because their show sucks so bad.  At least he's doing comedy on TV.  All right.  Now, wait a minute.  I'll now agree with Pharrell.  You've got to get credit where it's due for certain things.  Yeah.  It's just not being real. 
[00:43:30]  He did our show.  If he didn't think we were doing good radio, then why were you doing our show?  But I thought you sucked as a comedian.  He's a phony, dude.  This is what annoys me.  It's not coming from a real place.  No.  It's like I wasn't offended by the trailer.  It was shallow.  It was hollow and dull.  It's this phony grabbing at straws, kind of throwing everything out there because he's  lost.  In one clip I heard, and this is where I became embarrassed for him.  He goes, why don't you cut your hair, you Nazi? 
[00:44:00]  I'm upset.  I thought he was calling me a Nazi.  Why don't you cut your hair?  The one compliment I thought I was getting, and it wasn't even for me.  He walks around the living room at 3 o'clock in the morning dressed like Hitler, mumbling  to himself.  All right.  There are some accuracies in his ramblings.  Comedy on TV, and getting popular and getting huge, I always kind of thought he was getting  bigger than them, because nobody listens to them anymore, so that guy should just get  rid of them and have his own thing, and they'd be famous.  But he sucks on their dicks so much all the time that he can't stop biting down on their 
[00:44:30]  hairy dicks.  He just sucks the dicks so much he's ridden their dicks his whole career.  So now he can't separate himself and be funny, because he's not funny.  So he can't figure out where he's going, so he does the same thing every day.  Beats his head into a wall like the kid on the short bus.  Wait, can we stop for a short bus joke?  Yeah, yeah, let's analyze that.  A short bus joke.  Yeah.  A fucking short bus joke.  Should I take a long walk off a short pier, you fucking middle-aged hack?  That's a good one.  Middle-aged hack.  Dude, he went from saying, you're funny, and you're taking off, and we suck, and you're 
[00:45:00]  funnier than us, and that's why you're taking off, to you're sucky.  Like, we're all in the same fucking breath.  Because he's a fucking fraud.  And he's a desperate liar.  He wants to land with a splash.  He's just a lying jerk-off.  He's going to get some excitement the next week or two, and then it's going to go away,  Scotty.  And then what?  And then what?  You burned another fucking bridge, didn't you?  How long do you think Howie's going to like this?  Come on over, little man.  I'll beat your ass. 
[00:45:30]  You know where I'm at.  Find me right now.  Get off at 11.  Find me right now, tough guy.  You know where I'm at, Mr. Tough Guy Comedian.  I will beat your four-foot ass into the ground and leave you laying in a gutter.  You know where to find me, you little bitch?  Wait, wait.  For a minute there.  Did he have a cat sound effect?  I thought I heard a cat sound effect to go with gutter.  His show could not be that fucking bad and hacky that he would play a cat sound effect  with gutter. 
[00:46:00]  Please tell me I didn't hear that.  Yes, I think you did.  He's throwing out a real threat and then having silly sound effects.  Yeah.  That's cute.  And you're at least 4'6".  Let's, come on.  Hey, no short jokes, guys.  I'm short?  How about my fat tits and my appendix scar?  I get to the meat of the issue.  I'm a disaster physically.  Oh, no.  Don't make fun of the way I look.  Do I have a weak chin, too?  Tee-hee-hee.  Holy shit, are you a jerk-off.  You fucking middle-aged, desperate, junkie motherfucker. 
[00:46:30]  Yeah, I am a junkie.  I like to party.  I like to party.  Ugh.  Jason in Minnesota.  I'm inviting them to come visit me.  Come visit me.  I even asked them out on a lunch date.  Come on, let's go iron it out.  We'll go talk.  You guys are...  A lunch date?  You want to have a play date, you faggot?  A lunch date?  You want to fucking do some finger painting and play with blocks?  We'll go get a play date together.  A lunch date? 
[00:47:00]  What the fuck is a lunch date?  Real rock and roller.  Let's sit down and have tuna fish and hash this out like men.  Yeah.  Oh, fuck yourself.  No, the last lunch date is still pretty vivid in my head.  It was us sitting with our agent and you kissing our ass trying to get another job,  which seems to be your job, trying to get jobs,  because you can't keep jobs because you're an irresponsible drunkard.  That's pretty much it.  Just a fucking weakling, and that's what's sickening. 
[00:47:30]  It's like you're such a fucking weak, self-centered little faggot.  Don't try to lash out at everybody else because you can't fucking hold a job.  Tough shit.  Yeah.  You're a fucking baby.  Deal with it.  And what we did with that whole lunch, I thought I saw Jane Fonda,  and he's pointing out like, no, I know what she looks like.  So we're all hanging out.  We're all friends, and he's just a backstabbing little jerk-off.  And if you didn't like what we do or what I do, why didn't you say it then?  When we were across the table, why wouldn't you?  You fucking faggot.  Why wouldn't you say it there?  Yeah.  Come on down.  We'll fucking, we'll thumb wrestle.  We'll thumb wrestle and have a salad. 
[00:48:00]  Ugh.  Shut up.  Now that sounds like fun, though.  What a douche.  Eh, pot sound.  We'll smoke pot.  Bunch of guys smoking doobies.  Ugh.  It's 1988.  Oh, dude.  That fucking, and when he used to be on the fan, I heard him,  and he would play the fucking beer cracking open sound.  Hey, that's a good one now, Timmy.  He'd pour me a beer, and we'd go, and then you'd hear like-  Glug, glug, glug, glug, glug, glug.  You know, just a bunch of boys having brew-  Ugh.  Oh, there it is.  Pouring a little beer here. 
[00:48:30]  And that makes good radio, I guess.  Dude, it's just that fucking boys club nonsense.  Any girl that gets on the air is like,  Yeah, baby, let me, yeah, you're so hot.  Yeah, I was with some chick last night.  No, you weren't.  Shut up.  That's right.  You were fucking scooping diapers out like pudding.  Right.  Mr. Mom.  That's what you were doing.  You were cleaning shit out of a diaper.  Heavy metal.  You guys are fag.  You can't dance with me.  You're afraid to even come face me, you little dick.  Jason, go ahead.  Scott Pharrell shit dick. 
[00:49:00]  Thank you.  Back.  I am a shit dick, and I'm good at it.  The pests.  The pests are great, man.  Thinking he could finally go to the phone,  and someone's going to back him up.  Yeah.  And instead he gets the-  Scott Pharrell shit dick.  All right, let's go to Yellowstone Park.  I swear I got a son that's not a-  Oh, my God.  There it was.  Oh, gross.  Hold on.  Speaking of Yellow.  Yellowstone.  There's a cough button here, so we don't have to-  Yeah, there we are.  Steve, as long as I don't lick the mic. 
[00:49:30]  Steve, go ahead.  Steve.  I'm a huff for real.  Hey, he's got a little flabber knuckle in his back, too.  I was just wanting to let you know,  me and my friend A-Rock was sitting here listening to you guys.  Yeah.  And he sounds so awesome.  Don't let the pests kiss you down, you suck-ass motherfucker.  Oh, thank you.  Anyway.  And he hangs up on him.  He dumps out.  Right.  Wow, tough guy.  Dumps out.  Why not deal with the calls, man?  Because it was every fucking call.  Yellowstone Park.  All right, you're on, Steve.  What a dope.  What a fucking dope. 
[00:50:00]  Even your friends sitting there doing bongs with you thinking you're a dickhead, dude.  When they leave at night, after they smoke all your weed, they talk bad about you.  They're like, dude, bro, he's such a fucking idiot.  We just smoked all his weed.  Tyson's a dumb-ass motherfucker.  Do you hear him try to call up around and be funny and say something funny about Jimmy?  It's so funny.  He's got yellow jizz.  Jimmy, he's got yellow jizz.  God damn, dude.  It's so funny that you think you guys are cool, man.  It is so funny to me.  My favorite is the story.  The lead-in story.  You know he's leading nowhere. 
[00:50:30]  So anyway, I was walking down the hall with a pizza delivery guy, and the Domino's guy  left a phone number that, Jimmy, I have a load of yellow.  He hasn't made anybody laugh in five years.  Now you're stuck again.  Come on down, little man.  I'll beat your head in.  We heard you the first time.  We get it.  We get it.  You're going to beat everybody up.  Oh, no.  You know what?  For the hell of it, I think we're going to go down there and try to get through security.  Yes, I'm here to beat up Scott Farrell.  All right.  Hold on a minute.  Your name.  Can we have your ID?  Sure.  Here it is. 
[00:51:00]  I'll give you my license.  All right.  All right.  Take this badge.  Put it on.  Go up to the 50th floor.  All right.  All right.  So then let's say I get past the security guard.  All right.  All right.  Let's figure this out.  He keeps saying, you know where I am.  All right.  So I walk up to the seat.  Hello.  I'm here to beat up Scott Farrell.  Scott Farrell.  He's expecting me.  Right.  He's expecting me.  Here is my ID.  Uh-huh.  All right, Opie.  As we fill out some paperwork, why don't you sit down over there?  They print up a visitor's badge for you?  Right.  We've been through this many times.  Stick it on your shirt. 
[00:51:30]  That's Greg with two G's.  Okay.  Two G's.  And in his little notebook, it says Opie, Greg Opie Hughes.  Right.  I'm here to beat up Farrell because you need a reason to be there.  And he told me, so I'm sure he would leave my name at the desk.  Right.  It would be at the desk.  With the reason why I'm there.  Uh-huh.  All right.  Then I finally get through security, which would never happen, obviously.  We live in a 9-11 world.  And then they say, all right, take the elevator up.  What was it?  Like 50, 52 stories?  Something like, yeah, 50th floor.  Pretty much.  Oh, look, Iraq just put your name tag on. 
[00:52:00]  Oh, there's a little badge for you.  Greg Opie Hughes.  So you're up.  You got your tag on your visitor tag.  We've been to the Little Doggy Company a bunch of times, okay?  So I know there's at least two or three security doors you'd have to go through at that point.  You've got to go through.  Yeah.  And then they have, like, I don't know, a million studios.  So let's say I get through the two.  But the receptionist, too, is there.  So you have to tell her while you're there, hi, I'm here to beat up Farrell.  He's expecting me.  He's busy right now.  Could you just sit in the chair?  And now you're sitting in that huge glass lobby. 
[00:52:30]  Right.  So you're sitting there in a chair with your name tag on, just looking around, waiting.  Just whistling to myself.  And then what is a show producer come up first?  Hi, how are you?  My name's Bob.  Right.  You're Opie?  Yeah.  Maybe they'll offer me a cup of coffee or something.  You want some coffee or some water?  No, that's okay.  All right.  Well, we're just trying to get one of the conference rooms set up for the fight.  Uh, so if you could just sit a couple of minutes. 
[00:53:00]  Wait, wait.  These idiots.  What a jackass.  Idiots.  These idiots.  Come on up.  You know where I am.  Yes.  Behind 18 locked doors.  Right.  Josh in Ohio.  Go ahead.  What's stupid?  Hey, what's up, man?  I think about calling my girlfriend on the other line.  I'm breaking up with her for you, man.  I think that's great, dude.  You think I should try it, dude?  I think you should try it.  Call her up.  Ramone.  What?  Oh, Ramone.  Are you streaming to the phone?  What? 
[00:53:30]  You like the Ramones?  What?  What's the matter, dude?  And he dumps out.  What?  You're on a satellite radio company, heavy metal.  Yeah.  You fucking faggot.  Hey, Mr. Balls.  Come on.  Call up.  Pick up the Pharrella phone.  Oh.  And you hit the Pharrella dump button.  You fucking Pharrella faggot.  Dump.  Dump.  Take a commercial every 20 minutes.  Take some Pharrella commercials.  You know, the people in PalTalk are hilarious. 
[00:54:00]  Mr. Hughes, sorry for the delay.  Mr. Pharrell is getting reamed.  Coffee?  And then Pat Fermanaki, Opie, holding his briefcase.  Yeah, I would dress the part.  Nice.  In a suit and tie.  Suit and tie.  Briefcase.  Open it with his brass knuckles in it for the big duel.  Right.  You're going to duke it out.  Come on down.  I'll give you a knuckle sandwich.  Oh, shut up.  Knuckles.  What a douchebag.  Come on down.  I'll pound you into the pavement.  Maybe I would give a presentation.  What fucking...  What is that thing on the screen? 
[00:54:30]  Oh, a PowerPoint.  A PowerPoint.  PowerPoint presentation.  On a fight?  On an office fight?  Well, first I will do this that Master Poe taught me.  I'd like to do this move here.  Right.  First, I'm going to blacken your eye.  That fucking cornball.  Come down, I'll pound you.  Who is he?  Dusty Rhodes?  What a douche.  I'll mortalize you.  Why don't you come down here, you yeller?  You yeller.  I'll put you in a 54 leg lock.  Will ya?  Will ya?  Will ya, Scott?  Hey, call me on the Pharrella phone. 
[00:55:00]  Who's this?  My cunt?  My cunt.  Why you?  One plea?  Oh, you're on.  I'll cut Z's in your cheeks.  Pharrella red.  Any Pharrella fans that want to call up, please, you're not going to get dumped out of.  He dumps out because he's a pussy.  Let her rip.  We're not going to dump out of you.  Still waiting for the first one to come in.  None.  Because it'll be fun. 
[00:55:30]  Hello, you're on Howard 101.  Hey, guys.  How you doing, man?  I'm doing terrific.  I'm going to go see my therapist after this.  Maybe get in a brawl down in the street.  I think two of us, my friend.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, listen, I want to say, I just tuned into you recently.  I just got serious.  I want to say, you're fantastic, bro.  You're out of control.  I think you're funny as hell.  Yeah.  I'm sorry, your partner.  I'm sorry, your name is here?  It's Lynn.  You guys are great together.  You guys make me laugh.  I hope, dude, are you going to continue doing Radio with Stern? 
[00:56:00]  I'm going to keep doing Radio with Howard, and everybody's jealous of me, and Lynn's just  mad at me because I keep getting in fights with all my old friends that don't like me anymore.  No, I'm not mad at you.  Yeah, you are.  You think I've lost control of the show, wasting time arguing with people?  But then she said, yeah, call him.  Get him on the air.  I got to admit it.  I wanted to see what would happen.  I didn't want him on the air.  I just wanted to talk to him.  No, you can't talk to him privately.  I said, let's hook up and go have a burger and figure this shit out.  What's the matter?  That's exactly what it says.  You're going anywhere with your dick-ass, faggot, fuck-ho. 
[00:56:30]  I'll fucking kill your dad, motherfucker.  You come near my family.  Come on.  He didn't say that.  You touched my brother living in the suburbs.  You're fucking dead.  I'll send all my Guido fucking losers after you.  By the way, I didn't say any of this.  Guido losers?  I didn't say any of this.  But, oh, he just wanted to go for a burger.  Oh, burger.  Oh, yeah, and it's real smart to get my brother involved.  My brother that doesn't leave his house and just trains in his basement waiting for the  day that he could finally kill somebody.  That's real smart, Scott.  You think he'll make it through security over there, your brother? 
[00:57:00]  Do you know when Mancow did his bullshit with us that I actually had to talk?  This is a true story.  I had to sit my brother down and go, you cannot fly to Chicago and beat up Mancow.  I actually had this conversation with my brother.  You know something?  For all the bullshit you hear, these fights, these physical fights never materialize.  Radio people are pussies. 
[00:57:30]  It doesn't happen.  You don't get them.  You get in a situation where all of a sudden you're at a function and you see these people.  They just avoid each other.  Bunch of fucking faggots.  It would just, I hate his fat, you know what, for all, his whole show sounds like the disclaimer  at the end of a car commercial.  That's what you do.  You're the fucking FedEx commercial.  Only less interesting.  I talk real fast.  Like, what's, that's intriguing.  You're not some rambling genius.  You're just a fucking self-centered cock who can't let anybody else get a word in. 
[00:58:00]  And you're not that interesting.  Radio.  I'll send all my guido fucking losers after you.  Here's my dick on your lip.  How's that taste?  Whatever.  I could care less what you think of fucking me.  I'm nasty.  Don't fucking come here.  Uh-oh.  Yeah, look out.  Don't get on his bad side.  He's wild.  Why don't you dip a stick in AIDS and fuck your mother with it?  Why don't you do that, you silly goose?  Hello.  Good evening.  How's it going, Scotty?  It's going terrific.  Bless all of you.  Ah, not much. 
[00:58:30]  I want my son to swear for you.  That's terrific.  Let's get all the children swearing.  How old is your son?  He's four years old.  What does he want to say to me?  Uh, awesome lady.  Can you say fuckeataburlick.com?  Whatever, dude.  Are you kidding me?  There are people that sick that they're putting their kids in that.  That's what we're going to do.  We're going to teach our kids to be losers, just like the radio host.  Oh, come on.  Oh, come on.  Oh, she's starring the whole lines, huh?  You hear that?  Yeah.  Oh, come on.  Come on.  That was a whole line.  Oh, come on. 
[00:59:00]  Whole line.  Oh, you.  Oh.  Someone's suggesting Jimmy is like Dracula, because there is a trading of bodily fluids,  and then the woman dies.  I'm only, hey guys, am I really taller than four feet?  That really hit an insecurity button.  Yeah.  It's okay, Jimmy.  Oh, God, are you a jerk off?  We're trying to move through this, trust me.  I want to spend all day on it.  There were so many pests that got through, it was great.  Dude, I got, I don't even know, I got like 40 some odd tracks in front of me. 
[00:59:30]  Yeah.  We're trying to just play some of the better ones.  Yeah, Matt in Atlanta, go ahead.  Shake it up.  Shake it up.  Shake it up.  Everybody's doing it, they just won't admit it.  You're a fuck-out.  Guys, the last time I heard from you was years on 96 Rocks here in Atlanta.  You're a fuck-out.  And let me tell you, it is just great to hear you back on the air.  Red rum, fuck-out.  Red rum, fuck-out.  He's having a hard day.  Yellow, yellow discharge.  Yellow, there goes my tooth.  Fuck-out.  Yellow tooth.  I'm a Nazi.  I'm a Nazi. 
[01:00:00]  Red rum, red rum.  What?  Wait, wait.  I don't even understand that, and I'm trying really hard.  What was he doing there?  What he was doing was expressing frustration that he lost control of his shitty radio show.  And that he had no fans to call it as backup.  At this point, the pests are running the show.  The pests have taken over your show, the show.  And they run your show.  And now they're running our show, because now we've got to give them props so they continue  being our pests.  See?  Yes.  See how scary this whole thing is? 
[01:00:30]  We have a lot of things to talk about today, but we have to give props to the pests, or they're  going to turn on us.  This is how it works.  We don't control these guys anymore.  I want to be talking about Dick Cheney and how the vice president pretty much killed somebody.  Well...  We have to start with this.  I don't think the guy he shot would like to hear your report.  What's his name?  Menino?  I said pretty much.  The guy's still alive, but come on.  Yeah.  We'll get into that story in a little while.  Because he got peppered.  Because that's what happens when you shoot a fucking shotgun.  Maybe he's allergic to pepper. 
[01:01:00]  Is there any place you haven't been?  Remember the fight I told you you got the shit beat out of me at the pizza place in Atlanta  and I got mugged and mugged?  Yes, yes, yes.  I have apparently fixed the relationship.  Remember the guy who called it?  Yeah.  I tried to fix that fight and I tried to fix this fight.  Just like, let's hook up and talk it out.  I'm not a dick.  You think I'm a dick because all your tool friends read too many blogs.  I don't even control my blog.  I don't even write on it.  I don't even go on it.  I swear to God, I got a ton of people doing it.  Even Orph was doing it.  Right.  I mean, everybody does it.  I got 20 people working on it. 
[01:01:30]  Everything I say on my website is religious gold.  Stay tuned and believe it.  Just like the media and all the blogs.  Believe everything you read.  Sucker.  Oh my God.  How dumb are you?  How fucking dumb are you?  You believe everything you read?  Believe this.  You are a douchebag.  Hello?  Oh my.  You got to take some responsibility, Scott.  It was on your website.  Written in his type of babble.  And you had no problem reading it and saying, all right, yeah, this could stay up there.  And how about when you realize it's on there and if you didn't agree with it, you take it down and go, hey, you know, I don't know what the fuck was up there. 
[01:02:00]  Some idiot I work with, make a joke of it, whatever, anything.  No, you meant it.  You're lapping ass over there to try to get a gig because you can't hold a job for longer than six months.  But did you read what he wrote after the fucking, I wish somebody could send in the response he wrote when he denied doing it?  Yeah.  The fucking, I didn't do that.  Those guys are my friends.  The little bong sound effect. 
[01:02:30]  Bunch of boys smoking pot.  Elbow to the ribs.  Oh, nee.  Hello, Scott.  You are good evening.  I remember you from Pharrell on the bench.  Yeah, man.  Can you tell the hoes, shut up, ho, shut up, ho, shut up, ho, Mongo from Newark.  I got you.  Mongo, shut up, ho, shut up, ho.  Shake it in, shake it in, shut up, ho, shake it in.  So is this what guys do when they fight?  Like, they just kick on women?  No, that's their third grade audience that calls every two seconds.  Hey, wow, you should see how much money I'm getting to do this.  Hello.  Exactly.  You should egg them on when you say that. 
[01:03:00]  I am egging them on.  I'm the fucking milkman, woman.  I'm the fucking milkman.  How about you're getting minimum wage over there because you don't even have a job yet?  Hope the audition goes well.  Do you want to take a bath with me, Rick?  I already am in your sweat.  She's going to go home tonight.  Here's Lynn when she goes home.  Sorry, what's me?  Well, we were doing great for the first two hours, but then he spent the entire last hour  talking to these nimrods that kept going and attacking him.  They kept calling me something like a, I don't know, a hole.  What is that? 
[01:03:30]  Like, oh, my God.  That's a hole.  I'm not bothered by any of this at all.  I tried to fix it.  You feel like you're bothered by it.  They don't want to fix it.  If they fix it, then they have nothing to talk about.  Who's that?  Oh, yeah.  That's so...  I don't want you fucking phonies.  It doesn't fix it.  You think you'd come over and go for a burger and we'd sit down and laugh about it?  Go fuck yourself.  All right.  I'm trying to wrap up here.  I think that's our cue.  Hello.  You're on the air.  Hello. 
[01:04:00]  Oh, come slum the fuck home.  Something about telling me you're sweat.  What?  Hello.  You're on.  Hey, man.  I've got one word for you, man.  Douchebag.  Hello.  You're on.  Hello.  Hey, Pharrell.  What?  The wind just got dog-washed and I got another snot in my nose.  I don't know where they're coming from.  Yeah.  Not you.  Ah, what?  Lynn, go ahead.  Yes, you, baby.  Get a bullet that, Tom, you faggot.  Oh, no, no, no.  That's for you to beat this dick on your lip, faggot.  God, do you understand how gay this is?  Hello.  Hello.  You're on gay radio. 
[01:04:30]  Hello.  Hey, man.  What happened to you?  Kick your ass for 10 minutes just to say you're the man?  No, not at all.  How can I even think about being a man when you want to kiss my ass?  You're on the air.  Go ahead.  Yeah, this is Bill from Boston.  Thanks, Bill.  Good night.  Thanks, Lynn.  Good show.  I'm Pharrell.  We'll see you tomorrow night, 8 to 11 each.  Five day west on Howard 100.  It seemed like there's a poker tournament.  He lost complete control of any little control that he ever had of the show.  The Pests own the program. 
[01:05:00]  Listen to The Pests on Sirius Satellite Radio.  Yeah, that's right.  The Pests show.  How can I be the man when you the man?  You got to say it faster, though.  You the man.  Let's go to Russ in Iowa.  Russ?  All right.  I appreciate you taking my call, guys.  Oh, no.  Hang up.  I might be a Pharrell fan.  No, no, no, no.  Yeah, I'm not a Pharrell fan, so don't hang up, please.  Give me some time.  Don't worry about that.  I got to call Jim.  Jesus Christ, man.  Why don't you get in a celebrity boxing match with this guy instead of talking this shit 
[01:05:30]  you're talking to?  Because, dude, I'll tell you why.  I make my living talking.  Talking, yeah.  That's what you do on a radio show.  Oh, I understand that.  Hold on, sweetie pie.  Shh.  Sweetie, I'm explaining to you.  You ask me, I'm explaining to you.  I'll go, okay.  Any dummy that would have a celebrity, a what?  Maybe the girl could come, and we could have a battle of the sexist, family feud type thing.  Well, listen, the way you're running, the way you're talking, man, how do you walk to 
[01:06:00]  the streets without somebody knocking the shit out of you, man?  Why would they?  For what?  He insulted me?  I'm insulting him back.  You, Jesus.  Yeah, what, though?  What are you having trouble with?  He insulted me unprovoked, so I'm insulting him back.  What would you like me to do after he insulted me on the show?  He wants you to get into the octagon.  He insulted you.  He didn't insult, you're not married, but you're talking about his wife.  He talked about their girlfriends.  That's why.  Stupid.  That's their fight.  That ain't your fight. 
[01:06:30]  We're all in this together.  We're all a team here, my friend.  What am I going to do, single out one line?  Well, that wasn't about me.  Oh, your turn.  They're all a team.  I don't know his wife or his kid, and we only responded to that because he said the people  are threatening his wife and kid.  We don't care about his wife and kid.  That's the point I was making.  No one wants his wife and kid threatened.  No one gives a shit about either one of them.  Who cares?  It's him.  We've been in this together for this combination of the Opie and Anthony show like six years  with Jimmy at least, right, Jim?  Yeah.  Maybe even more.  Scott Farrell has had probably 10 to 12 different versions of his show since then because he 
[01:07:00]  can't hold a job down.  You don't care about his wife and kid.  I think we know what we're doing here, Russ.  You don't care about his wife and kid.  He's a bigger danger to his wife and kid than anybody else that's making these alleged  threats.  Come home after a bottle of Jameson and roll over on your infant.  Jesus Christ, you drunk.  So to answer your question, that's why.  And I really don't care about his wife and kid.  I don't go after somebody's family, but he mentioned them and said that people are threatening  them.  Dude, please.  No one was threatening them.  Please. 
[01:07:30]  Stop it.  It didn't come from me.  Ever.  So this is from Darren, I guess, finally, from Whackbag.  The Sweeper.  Uh-huh.  Initiating satellite scan.  It all stemmed from the L&A thing.  Camera deployed.  Fuck Pharrell.  Fuck Pharrell.  Holy shit.  They're actually talking about this on Howard's show?  Yeah.  Satellite coming down.  Everyone in the industry.  L&A, man, man.  For the fucker left.  They have told the air staff not to mention us, not to talk about us anymore. 
[01:08:00]  We were done.  You know?  But I think the press at this point, they could smell a phony.  Hey, good morning, boys.  Good morning.  I want to let everybody know that the attack is still on for tonight.  Have fun.  Have fun taking calls, Pharrell.  You son of a...  Not you.  Yeah.  Take this man with throat cancer off the air.  I'm here.  Let's go to Rose in West Virginia.  Rose.  Hey, it's me.  Hey.  I need the Mavadana call.  I'm calling in to take credit for it.  Did you?  Oh, that was you?  Yep. 
[01:08:30]  Very good.  Very good.  One of our pests helping us out.  Come on, get some.  Hey, fuck them.  I'm locked on.  Don't I'm hit home?  Fuck them all.  Artiller in fire.  So you get nothing. 
[01:09:00]  You lose.  Good day, sir.  It goes on forever.  Jesus.  Welcome to D&D.  It's an epic.  It's an epic from Darren from Whackbag.  There you go.  That got rave reviews on Whackbag?  No.  They must have been tired.  I would give it a semi-hard on. 
[01:09:30]  Going back to the first.  Really?  I'd give it slightly plump.  I'd give it a fucking cold shower dick after a beating.  Let's go to Ramone in Canada.  Ramone.  Ramone.  Boys, you guys fucking destroyed a show, by the way.  Well, that's what we're hearing.  It's the pest.  I used to be an awful serious subscriber up here in Canada.  Got XM.  XM is far better.  And one thing.  This is for you.  God, I'm fucking nervous.  Jimmy, how come you and Florentine can coexist and these awful radio guys can't? 
[01:10:00]  Because I'll tell you.  Because Jimmy doesn't even have to say this.  Florentine is a stand-up guy.  Florentine is a real guy.  An honest guy.  Florentine was part of the Opie and Anthony show back in the day, okay?  We didn't have room for Florentine, unfortunately, okay?  So he does stuff for Howard.  But he doesn't go on there and trash us.  Yep.  He's the real deal.  That's what we're trying to say here today.  People have this misconception that if you do Howard's show or if you work over at Sirius, 
[01:10:30]  that we automatically hate you.  And that's what Pharrell was trying to say.  The reason that we started bashing him was that he got a job over there.  It's not the case.  Have a job.  Have a career.  Who are we to say, no, you're not supposed to work there?  It's not the case.  The case is going over there and then turning on people that were supposed to be your friends  and bashing them to try to get a little inside with your new fucking boss.  Yeah, and I take friendship very seriously. 
[01:11:00]  I don't have many friends in my real life because I take it very seriously.  And I made the mistake of making a lot of friends on radio and realized that was just horse shit.  Absolute horse shit.  Opie, keep your friends to two-inch by two-inch cubes on a computer screen, little squares.  Oh, look at my friends.  That's right.  I can see them.  But if I want to get out of this, I press that button, boom, my friends disappear off the screen.  But before Jimmy said anything, I want to get that in there.  I love Florentine. 
[01:11:30]  I see him out in the comedy clubs all the time.  There's no problem between us and Florentine.  Unfortunately, I would love to have him on this radio show.  We just didn't have room back when it was all kind of developing and coming together.  And he's talented enough that he should be doing something on the radio.  And Howard picked him up and he's on there every once in a while and he does a great job for Howard.  That's the deal, man.  Florentine got me my first paid gig in comedy.  He's a real friend.  He's not a showbiz friend.  And there's a lot of guys in radio, I guess.  These guys are my real friends.  But I would have very few friends in radio. 
[01:12:00]  Comics don't really stab each other like that, I think, because we interact a lot more than radio guys, too.  Like, I see these guys, we go on the road together, whereas radio guys will fucking meet once and then just hear each other.  And there's no interaction.  There's no real...  It's tougher, man.  Make no mistake about it.  If Pharrell went over there and he got a gig and he didn't say anything bad about us, so be it.  Yeah, fine.  But he decided to take shots at us when supposedly we were friends, had the same agent, went out to eat here and there.  You know, he invited me to play golf.  And it's a true fact I helped him get the gig at N.E.W. because, you know, he burned so many bridges in the past. 
[01:12:30]  They were a little shaky with it.  We're like, come on, man.  Let's give him a shot.  He knows all that.  And then to turn around and then trash us like that, that's the problem we're having here.  And we really...  I liked, on a personal level, I liked him.  I always liked the guy.  I never had a problem with Pharrell.  I thought he was a nice dude.  I did his show in Atlanta.  There was no animosity at all.  And apparently you weren't funny.  That's what he said.  He was just an awful guy to interview, and I didn't even care.  We hung up for 25 minutes.  It was actually a fun hang. 
[01:13:00]  It's like, then they come back dishonestly.  It's like, dude, I tell the truth.  You know, you're not being truthful.  That's why I'm embarrassed for him.  It's like you're groveling, trying to make a splash.  Contradicts himself in the same sentence.  It's embarrassing.  Just be honest, man.  Stop being such a radio hack phony.  We lost Brewer, but he didn't go over there and start trashing us.  No.  He loves doing radio with us.  We think he's one of the funniest guys out there, but it just didn't work out.  It didn't work out.  We were fighting for him, but he decided that, well, whatever.  And who are we to be pissed at somebody because a deal didn't work out with the company we 
[01:13:30]  work for?  Right.  Like, I don't know what goes on behind the scenes.  I don't know why Pharrell didn't get hired by XM, and is it serious?  I don't know the behind-the-scenes dealings of this.  So who am I to say, oh, this guy's a fucking asshole for not taking XM?  Maybe XM offered him less money.  Maybe Sirius offered him a much better deal.  I don't know that.  So I have no problem if anyone wants to work over there.  It's the bashing. 
[01:14:00]  When you go over there and feel that if you now cash in your fucking friend, it's going  to buy you credit with fucking asshole Howard over there.  And he doesn't give a shit about you, Scott Pharrell.  Oh, my God.  He doesn't even give a shit about his own girlfriend.  He just gives a shit about himself.  Let me tell you what Howard's doing over there.  He's very desperate.  There's two channels, 24 hours a day, that he is responsible for filling up.  He had 14 months to come up with somebody from the time he signed the deal till he was on 
[01:14:30]  the air.  14 months to come up with programming for two channels.  He can't.  There's no one out there.  There's no one out there to fill up that much fucking paid programming.  Oh, there's plenty of people that are great for free radio, but no one wants to fucking  pay for it.  So now he's scrambling and getting people like Pharrell to get on there.  And it's just no one wants to fucking pay to listen to Pharrell.  I'm sorry.  This ain't happening.  But if you want to call Pharrell, don't do a commercial for the other company. 
[01:15:00]  Here's a commercial for the other company.  888-783-7610.  That's the Pharrell phone number.  It's like telephone.  Only with the Pharrell name in front of it.  Yeah.  I'm just really tired.  I went to the Jimmynasium last night.  Now you're using it.  LOL.  Well, you could dial 888-STERN-100 from 8 to 11 East Coast time.  888-783-7610. 
[01:15:30]  And it's coming soon that they're going to just shut them down.  They're not happy that our boys are getting through.  And the technology that the pests are using now, where they are able to gather all together.  It isn't one of these things where each of them individually have to listen to the program  now and try to figure out when the best time to call in.  It's all a community now with one listening station.  So they're all linked together like that. 
[01:16:00]  They're amazing, the pests.  Amazing.  Craig, so what's up?  Hey, Al, boys.  I'm a little pissed off, man.  You were bashing the Red Sox.  And I'm a huge Red Sox fan.  As big as Ben's fucking hog.  Because XM, satellite radio, Opie and Anthony.  Oh, God.  You've got to be careful with Boston, too.  Because, you know, they were in that market.  Keep listening to me and keep talking about that.  Well, God, I wasn't even on the air in Boston.  And I'm more popular in Boston than they are.  I mean, it's unbelievable.  You guys just keep calling. 
[01:16:30]  I love it.  Keep giving me all the attention.  Prove that.  I'm unfazed.  I love it.  You can do nothing.  You might be unfazed.  Howard ain't.  Joey Blunt.  Honest to God.  I've always been friends with him.  If you don't believe me, fuck him.  I can't help you any more than that.  If you don't like the fact that I say stuff, and I'll say it again, Howard will beat their  ass.  It's that simple.  He's better.  Always has been.  Always will be.  If you don't like what I'm saying, blow me six ways till Sunday.  How's that taste?  There you go.  On your breakfast.  Yeah, but it's not them.  Who wants some sugar?  I got some salty sugar.  They just keep talking to me about this, and that it's so gay, all these stories. 
[01:17:00]  I mean, it's just so stupid.  Joey.  There you go.  Yeah.  That's what you really believe.  That's fine.  But don't make believe you're my friend, you ass.  Hey, what's going on, man?  I am so happy you're back on radio.  I used to listen to you on Fox Sports, but also, fuck you, man.  They all listen to me no matter where I go.  They keep listening no matter where I go.  They're listening to harass you.  I'm not out with Joe because I'm quicker than that douchebag. 
[01:17:30]  No, not quick enough to get out, Opie.  Yeah.  Dump button.  A dump button.  I'm embarrassed for him that he has to hit the dump button.  A dump button for satellite radio.  Believe me, Howard is living.  We're on a slight delay, and that's just because of slander.  That's the only fucking reason.  And I think we hit it once.  Yeah.  I think we hit it once in 16 months.  Yeah, you can't have somebody blurting out some, or a phone number if somebody gets  a phone number.  There was one time we had to for some dumb thing.  Yeah.  Yeah, somebody called some old gym teacher by his real name. 
[01:18:00]  Right, right, right.  Yeah, by his real name, and then had some allegations that he had done something that might have  been illegal.  Right.  And you can't do that.  We're responsible for what goes out over the airwaves.  Is it the same guy that's doing traffic for walk?  Oh, my God.  We got some great stuff to talk about today.  But we don't have anything to talk about.  Nothing.  What else is going on the Pharrella show today?  Oh, Pharrell.  What's his name in there?  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring.  Pharrella phone. 
[01:18:30]  Where's the one that you guys want?  Pass, pass, pass, pass, pass, pass, pass.  Ruin your show.  Pharrell, welcome to the world of satellite radio.  The greatest moment of my life.  I'm curious.  Who's the young lady in the studio with you?  Tell them.  Lynn Hoffman.  She's VH1.  And tell them what you do now.  You've taken over the show.  Do you want me to talk now?  Yes.  All right.  Kid.  I don't know what to say now.  No.  Tell them who you are.  Ramon, do this bitch ace him?  Blah, blah, blah, blah.  Blah, blah, blah.  What was that?  I think it's some of the fans that I have right now.  Ramon, give this bitch ace. 
[01:19:00]  Oh, that's what he said?  That's what I think he said.  Steve in Yellowstone National Park where I've been lost on a snowmobile at 40 below on the  day of the Super Bowl.  They had to come find me.  Dig me out of the snow.  I rode on a snowmobile and I drank Aftershock and Goldschlager all day to stay alive.  I drank the entire bottle, both bottles, and I smelled like a big old whiskey bin when  I was done.  Yeah, man.  Wow, man.  Did you?  Did you, Scott?  Did you really?  How fucking cool is that?  Let me just let that sink in.  You're snowmobiling, you're fucking drinking Goldschlager and whiskey. 
[01:19:30]  God damn to be as cool as this guy.  This guy's a maverick.  Did you really, Scott?  He's a maverick.  Did you, Scott?  Dump button.  That's how you survived Super Bowl Sunday.  Where was a ditch and a fucking tree when you needed one during that little drunken excursion?  Who's believing this shit?  No one is.  You're sitting there with a hole and a dump button, you fucking Mr. Mom.  Go fuck yourself.  Big old whiskey bin when I was done, and then I had three people.  I love you even free. 
[01:20:00]  Well, they took advantage of me sexually.  They tied me to a bedpost and rammed candles in my ass.  I desperately want to make love for a schoolboy.  Oh, sorry, Steve.  You wanted to talk about jerking off with a fixation.  Good evening.  Yeah, yeah.  I almost choked on a chicken nugget once when I was jacking off.  Does that count?  I think it does.  Let me check on that.  Ramone, get this bag of this.  All right, whatever, dude.  Stop trying to bond with your listeners, stupid.  There are listeners.  I heard that they kept track during this whole assault. 
[01:20:30]  They got 50 phone calls through.  50 calls got through.  50 calls.  Speaking of horny, Creamy from West Virginia.  Speaking of spooching.  Hello, Creamy on my facial.  My vagina.  I love you, Creamy.  My vagina.  Oh, my.  Oh, my God.  Right off of her chin.  Oh.  Oh, right in the ear.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  My tits are godly.  My tits are godly. 
[01:21:00]  Whatever it is.  Who the hell is that?  I don't know, but if I had that voice in the morning, I might be able to get three.  Did you just say my tits are gold?  Oh, wow.  There you go.  Yeah, I'm sure Howard's really happy that you allowed that.  Yeah, that that's going out over his.  One of our callers.  The Howard 100.  And make fun of Howard's daughter.  Oh, yes.  Oh, it's that classic.  It just goes on and on.  I guess we have to thank the ONA pest, of course.  Thank you.  Of course.  Of course.  Oh, please.  The pest.  I photoshopped a pest of honor medal. 
[01:21:30]  And a couple of people have been putting it on their sigpix now.  Pest of honor.  It's an oldie-style telephone next to an oldie-style radio mic with lightning pulse next to it.  Russell in Alabama.  Very proud.  What's going on, boys?  What's up?  And I got through last night, and all I got in was a damn Anthony Lucky Strike reference.  And then I set myself up, you know, talking about how he's getting all this money, because 
[01:22:00]  I was going to throw out Jimmy's line, talking about take you serious and flush it down the  toilet.  Yeah.  And he fucking hung up on me right when I fucking built it up.  You know what I'm saying?  Yeah.  Why don't you just go with it, Pharrell?  He was hanging up on...  Let's see how good you are at doing radio.  On the few regular callers that were really trying to call in.  Yeah.  He was hanging up on them.  He got so paranoid because so many pests got through.  He was suspect of everybody.  Gabe in New York.  Gabe?  Hey, how's it going, boys?  Hey.  Yeah, so the other night I called in as Bill from Buffalo, and his idiotic screener didn't 
[01:22:30]  even recognize the fucking joke.  Which one is Bill from Buffalo?  Because I don't recognize either.  Buffalo Bill.  Sounds of a land.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, wow.  Come on.  Sorry.  All right.  Sorry, man.  We're here.  We're here.  We're here.  Thank you.  You know, I was driving home from Long Island.  I went to FH Riles over the weekend, whatever, and I'm coming back into the city, and there  was a van driving really slow in front of me, and the storm was just starting, and there  was something wrong with his headlights.  So I got past him, and then the whole time, just, would you? 
[01:23:00]  Would you?  Just reciting Silence of the Lambs lines.  They got a card right in here.  Come inside.  It was a very, very creepy scene.  Yeah.  Mrs. Lintman.  Gabe?  Wait, can someone please?  Here's my question.  Can someone please get in a Frederica Bimmel reference?  Write that down, people.  Pest, we need the delivery of a Frederica Bimmel bomb.  Frederica Bimmel.  Wait a minute. 
[01:23:30]  Wait a minute.  Is she a great big fat person?  Let's go to Frederica Bimmel.  She was a big girl, sir.  She was a big girl, sir.  Let's go back to Gabe.  Gabe?  Yeah.  All right.  Gabe?  Yes, yeah.  Hi, buddy.  Oh, so that's all you wanted to say?  No, no, no.  What happened was, uh, Pharrell was being topical, and he brought up blowjobs, tee hee.  So, uh, the reason I got through was because I told Pharrell that I, uh, got a blowjob  in a car, and I got arrested.  And, uh, him in the hole fell for it, and then I dropped the, uh, Buffalo Bill reference. 
[01:24:00]  I don't know if you guys have the audio, but it was pretty funny.  All right.  Yeah, we're still going through all the audio, to be honest with you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  You know, Doug had a great phone call today.  Yeah.  I wonder if I should save him or take a chance here, because they just handed me a phone  call here that he did, and they're saying it's really good.  Doug is pretty good, because he's so over the top.  All right.  Let's see what it's all about here.  All right.  Let's go to, uh, North Carolina. 
[01:24:30]  What's happening?  You're on Howard 101.  Hey, what's going on, Pharrell?  Good to have you guys on the radio down here.  Thanks.  I got a good dump story.  I got dumped by my wife when I got caught cheating on her with one of her bridesmaids.  Oh, well, that's not that big of a deal.  Well, that's kind of ridiculous.  Well, well, well, well, it just so happens that her husband was my best friend.  Now, you want to talk about pissed?  This guy was more pissed off than people that get dumped on satellite radio.  Did you, uh, did you beat his ass, or did you just work it? 
[01:25:00]  Honestly.  I think you worked your friend's ass.  I think he was lying.  What's so gay about a story, I think, and some guy's going,  Oh, God, do you want my, uh, friend's bridesmaids?  Every wedding I go to, I nail at least two bridesmaids.  Of course.  Oh, yeah.  You're so fucking cool.  Do you think anyone is buying that stupid fucking act, you hack?  Do you think anyone's buying...  Wow, he's...  Dude, did you hear Pharrell?  He's banging bridesmaids. 
[01:25:30]  Drinking whiskey.  Every wedding he bangs at least two.  Drinking whiskey on a snowmobile.  Motherfuck, the guy's unbelievable.  What?  A kid?  Changed his diapers?  What?  You ought to change the name of your show to incorrigible.  You're incorrigible, Scott.  Wow.  Boy, you don't take no prisoners.  Vrooming around on a snowmobile, banging bridesmaids.  Wow.  What a man.  And by the way, that story Doug told is completely true. 
[01:26:00]  Oh, I know.  That's why I like Doug.  He's more honest on the phone than you are on your fucking radio show.  Doug holds up in front of the PalTalk cameras, Doug holds up like legal paperwork that shows  divorce things.  Pictures of weddings where he circles.  Here's the bridesmaid I fucked.  While at my wedding...  It's his wedding photo.  Just a despicable human being and not afraid or embarrassed to show everybody.  I just love it.  God, he's on our side.  Yeah, he's a problem.  I love it.  He is a problem.  Bridesmaids? 
[01:26:30]  Aren't they all whores?  The bridesmaids don't matter.  Sure.  You gotta put some fat chick in a dress?  What could be worse?  Put her in pink on the end.  I mean, I don't know.  You are ruthless.  Doug in Virginia, you like how quick I am?  Yeah, for real, I got leverage, baby.  I'm so quick.  Watch this.  I'm like a cartoon.  I'll work on you.  Come on, see if you can get me.  I'm quick.  Go ahead.  Come on.  I got a bunch of reasons for you why she left me, and one of them was because I had Hallie 
[01:27:00]  Toastis.  We used to call me Hallie.  Go ahead, Doug.  You're on the air.  Hey, because I love pussies.  I do.  You got it twice.  I love it, man.  Keep calling.  Keep listening.  Twice in a row with his name.  One night show on their bad show that no one listens to.  I'm on a bagel, a wheat bin, a wafer, a croissant, a triscuit.  Catch me if you can.  Ha-ha.  Ha-ha.  How do you like me now? 
[01:27:30]  Ha-ha.  As I'm fucking your wife.  Ha-ha.  Ha-ha.  My show's already better than yours.  I've been on three days, and I'm already better than you.  I have more listeners than you do.  You've been on for a year, and no one listens to you.  That's embarrassing.  It's embarrassing.  And you're a comedian for two.  I have a bigger dick than all of you two.  That is embarrassing.  Every night.  You like it like everyone else.  You can't throw me down. 
[01:28:00]  Come on.  If you want a piece, I'm down on Avenue, America's 6th Ave, 49th.  Let's see how tough you are, Mr. Roller Skater.  Has your faggot brother moved out of my neighborhood yet?  How many dicks have you sucked over there to get your job, redhead?  Pussy.  Pussy.  Pussy.  How do you like me now?  Pussy.  I'm lost.  That's why I do this.  I know.  I got something for you.  It's disturbing, actually. 
[01:28:30]  Hey, watch your repair, man.  I got something for you, too.  Like a career.  For Al in your facial.  And that just ends?  There's a fucking music bed under it.  You should be on PLJ, you fucking jizz bucket.  There you go.  And by the way, the guy...  I just want to reiterate, he says we have no listeners, so...  Yeah.  No listeners.  All right.  I guess he won't be getting any phone calls again.  Nope.  I guess maybe two people will... 
[01:29:00]  What'd you hopefully call tonight?  Destroy.  Destroy.  Pests.  Destroy.  Just keep wrecking his already unlistenable show.  That was...  Like, when he's singing, who is laughing at that?  You're not a funny guy.  All you are is a douche who talks quickly.  Yeah.  With a raspy voice that not many people have before they have their larynx cut out.  You know who has it?  Him and Tom Carvel. 
[01:29:30]  That's what you should be doing.  Selling Fudgy the Whale cakes while you're scooping out diapers.  Fudgy the Whale.  Fudgy the Whale.  Shake it up.  Shake it up.  Shake it up.  Enjoy the meeting with the bosses today because it's going to be a little different there,  Scotty.  How about you use the shake it up thing when you're putting your kid to bed?  Shake it up.  Shake it up.  Hey, wait.  He's not moving.  All right.  So there you go.  The Pest took over our show today, too.  The Pest took over our show today, too.  Thank you, ONA Pest.  If you want to be a pest for this program, good luck to you. 
[01:30:00]  I don't even know how you do it.  90 minutes without a break.  He was breaking every 20 minutes because it's a commercial fucking radio show.  And I don't think any...  Pharrell was banging bridesmaids two at a time.  Brandon from PA, thank you.  That's very funny.  And let it be known, not one Pharrell fan called.  And dude, I know he's like, hey, they wouldn't put them on.  The lines were tied up.  Dude, believe me, we'll put them on.  We don't have to even explain.  We've done it in the past many, many times.  Our work speaks for itself. 
[01:30:30]  We let everyone through this show, and we beat you up.  Or sometimes you beat us up.  It happens sometimes.  Hey, you guys want to hear a funny joke?  Yeah.  When I get home later, I'll get this out.  Oh, boy.  I'm going to go to the Jimmynasium.  Jimmynasium.  Because it's Jimnasium.  Your name is Jimmy.  Yeah.  And you put that.  God, is that funny.  It's funny to put your name in.  Like, wordplay jokes are always funny.  Always funny.  Wordplay.  Yeah, let's do a little wordplay for the rest of the day, okay? 
[01:31:00]  Yeah.  So there you have it.  That's the latest.  Don't call me, Scott.  It's over.  Now you have to deal.  You've got to deal with it.  But, Opie, you might be able to get together and have a little brunch.  A burger.  A little play date.  A little play date.  It'll be just like when we sat over there at the Park of Meridian with Bob Eatman, me,  Opie, Jimmy, Pharrell, all sitting around laughing, talking, him ass-kissing.  And, uh, nothing. 
[01:31:30]  All right.  Now we're the assholes.  Have some brunch.  We never get mad at people working.  It's serious, dude.  Mel's a good friend of mine.  Mel Carverson.  He called me.  He's like, dude, I wanted to come to XM, but I got a gig.  I'm like, Mel, you goose, go.  Go.  Go, you goose.  It's all about the Pal Talk, too.  We only do four hours a day.  But this show continues after we're gone.  So get on Pal Talk.  We're not making money off Pal Talk, by the way.  We just know it's a great extension to the show.  Oh, I was on Pal Talk last night just having a pisser.  There's hours and hours of fun after the show goes off the air. 
[01:32:00]  And then, uh, you know, let's, uh, promote Wackbag.com for, uh, people that want to get  more involved with the show.  W-A-C-K-B-A-G.com.  They do a great job over there as well.  Okay.  Yep.  We're going to move on to other things.  Uh, we've got to talk about Tony Danza today.  We've got to talk about, uh, Club Soda Kenny.  Club Soda Kenny all over the news.  He was, uh, in the New York Times yesterday.  They got his picture in front of the American flag.  Hi.  Anyone else find that really funny?  Very funny.  It's a freedom of speech issue with his job. 
[01:32:30]  Like, he's in a little bit of a jam, but hopefully he can, uh, get out of it.  And now the news is picking up on the story.  We've got some, um, really?  We've got Fox 5, News 12, WB 11, all I'm talking about.  Club Soda Kenny.  Club Soda Kenny.  And then we've got, uh, Club Soda Kenny being discussed on The View.  What?  I swear to God.  The View ladies decided to give it a little, uh, whirl.  Oh, I'm sorry we had to spend so much time on, um, good old Pharrell.  Because we have so much shit that we really should be talking about today. 
[01:33:00]  We've got to give our take on the Dick Cheney thing.  Eh, there's just a lot of stuff.  Bad boy figure skater.  Hey, you know what?  I think Pharrell ought to go hunting with Dick Cheney.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Woof.  Uh, he got some shotgun Pharrell.  Pellets.  Ah.  Got some Pharrellets.  Ah, it's like pellets, but with Pharrell in it.  Ah, that's hysterical. 
[01:33:30]  High hole dump.  High hole dump.  Yuck.  Suffered a minor myocardio in Pharrell-aforction.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  It's, it's like...  They have to dump over there, by the way.  They don't have true freedom.  They got some serious problems over there.  Yeah, good luck.  Have fun.  Serious problems, because they, uh, they didn't set up the business right, so they got  to be, they got to dump out, they got to be careful, they got to watch out for the FCC.  They really screwed up their business, uh, plan.  Screw it up. 
[01:34:00]  Oh my god.  The problem's over there already.  That's why they have dump buttons installed everywhere.  But to dump out and wreck your own show like it's a commercial radio show, instead of just  fucking smashing people.  Yeah, go with it, buddy.  Yeah.  You're so good.  Go with it.  Sound like you're doing your friend.  And I know why he's not going with it, because his boss has told him, you know, to dump out  of the Opie and Anthony mentions.  Yes.  And he's a big fan.  Didn't they, Scott?  Didn't they?  Hmm.  Now we play that for you, Howard. 
[01:34:30]  We're back with the Opie and Anthony program.  By the way, speaking of Bill Burr, he's going to be on Letterman this Friday night. 
[01:35:00]  Very cool.  He emailed me, I think it was Monday night.  It went very, very well.  And it turns out the writers for Letterman listen to this show on a daily basis, and they  were praising us on the Schizo Bill bit.  They thought the thing was written out.  They're like, wow, those guys are really good writers.  And Bill's like, now I'll tell you the truth, we all just kind of went with it and tried  to figure it out.  And then the writers couldn't believe it.  They're like, wait a minute.  When they kept reciting the stuff back to the guy over and over again, how did they remember  all the stuff that was said, you know, prior? 
[01:35:30]  They just didn't understand, you know, that we just went with that bit, that nothing was  written out.  We just decided to go free form and see if we could do something with Schizo Bill.  I told you, a couple of them Letterman writers came down to me and Caroline.  They said, dude, we're big fans.  We were writing.  We weren't able to get down.  You know, we could be writing for Dave.  But yeah, that was, they're actually, they're fans.  Yeah.  Oh my.  Oh my God.  What did you do?  What?  Holy shit.  What did you do?  Hold on.  What was that?  Anthony missed that.  Let me just get a quick plug in. 
[01:36:00]  The Schizo Bill bit is up on audible.com.  All our stuff is, it goes right to audible.com after we do it on the air, just in case you  want to download and stuff.  But Schizo Bill is its own separate download.  It's a one hour thing that you could, you could get on audible.com.  What did you do?  Nothing.  I'm trying to be some stylish guy.  What did you do?  Nothing.  Can't a motherfucker itch his head?  Oh no.  What's under that hat?  Itch your head for Anthony.  What?  What's wrong with the...  Wait, wait. 
[01:36:30]  Get a camera.  No, it's just a, just a head scratch.  Oh my God.  What's the problem?  You don't like my new hairdo?  No wonder you can't get laid.  I think for a whole time.  You just shaved it around like a bowl haircut.  But no, this is the, this is my new hairdo.  That's the fucking, that's my new hairdo.  Turn on, turn on, turn around.  Turn around.  Oh my God.  It's a perfectly cut bowl line around the back of your head. 
[01:37:00]  Wait, get every angle.  This, the haircut.  Oh my God.  One picture is not going to give it justice.  Get this, get the straight on, the side view, the back view.  Got it.  All the way around to the other side.  Hold, get that up on opiananthony.com immediately.  Get close to the pal talk camera.  That's my new hairdo.  It's your new hairdo.  Jimmy usually is bald.  I mean, you shave it bald.  Crew cut it, yeah.  Yeah, shave it.  I wouldn't call it a crew cut.  Well, yeah, like where you see the bottom, that's where it goes to. 
[01:37:30]  And he has no problem growing hair.  But lately, he's been growing it in.  And you've been getting a lot of compliments, by the way, on your hair being grown in.  Oh, they'll love this.  This is my new hairdo.  And you came in today with a hat on, and it looked like you went back to just shaving your head.  You're bald.  But he just itched his head while I was trying to do a plug for audible.com and the schizo bill bit.  And I lost it, obviously.  And Anthony didn't see it because he was reading in some feedback or something.  That is hilarious.  I can't even describe it.  It's like at least two inches above the ear, shaved all the way around with the top still in place. 
[01:38:00]  Yeah, it's my new hairdo.  Why did you do that?  Because the girls like a new hairdo.  Girls like a man with a new sharp hairdo.  Hairdo.  Tomorrow you've got to come here with the mohawk.  You have to do it.  Nothing wrong with a man taking care of himself and fixing up his hairdo.  Grooming.  Yeah.  What do you call it?  It's my new hairdo.  What do you call it?  You did that yourself?  Yeah, I had help.  I had a friend of mine help me out.  She zipped me in the back to make sure the hairdo was even.  Nothing turns a girl off more like an uneven coif. 
[01:38:30]  It is really even around the back.  Of course it is.  Let me see the back again.  Go ahead.  Take a look.  Go ahead.  Drink it in.  Oh, my God.  It looks like an African do.  Yeah, right.  The African, like.  Not even like, you know, American brothers.  This is like old school, like when you turn on.  In the jungle.  Right.  More like the South American, like.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  The guys that shoot the blowguns at the monkeys in the trees.  And paint themselves red.  Kind of like an aborigine do.  Yeah, something like that.  I can't wait to see the photoshops on Wack Bag tonight. 
[01:39:00]  What's my new hairdo?  I think people are going to like it.  I think it's going to be very popular.  I think people are going to like the new fashionable do that I have.  That is nice.  It's a change.  Yeah, you know, you let your hair grow.  I actually wanted to grow either a mullet or a rat tail, but it just would have taken  too long.  But I thought of mullet.  I'm like, God, I wish it would grow longer.  Will you go on stage like this?  No.  That's the opposite mullet.  Of course I will.  That's an opposite mullet.  You've completely cut off the part that would have made it a mullet. 
[01:39:30]  I wanted to peroxide the top, but I just didn't have time.  I got to do a little bit more with this hairdo to put some stuff in it.  Yeah, you're going to work it a little more.  Sure, sure, sure.  We've got a couple days left in the week.  I'm sure he'll come in with something else tomorrow or Friday.  Looking forward to it.  Does it look like Sling Blade?  Yeah, a little bit.  Oh, yeah, that's it.  A little bit.  Hey, give Darren some credit here.  Darren in Tennessee, very good.  You did the boy.  Yo.  Yeah, Darren.  Yeah, Jimmy, I want to know if Carl from Sling Blade cut your hair. 
[01:40:00]  Yeah, I wrecked your line, by the way.  Yeah.  Do it again.  I did it again.  But...  But I didn't read it as my own.  I'm like, wow, Darren from Tennessee, he's got it.  Well, did a pal...  I'm sorry.  Go.  Did a pal talk girls like it?  The girls got to love this.  They got to love it.  They're saying you look like Wesley Snipes in Blade.  There you go.  That's a good one.  That's a good one.  All right, let's go to Pat in Iowa.  Pat.  Yeah, I'm just going to tell you to flip it over to the Today Show on NBC.  They got Al Roker and Matt Lauer doing the double luge. 
[01:40:30]  It's the gayest thing I've ever seen, man.  Oh, they did it, right?  We were talking about that on Monday.  Yeah, I was flipping channels this morning, and I saw Roker in that stupid spandex suit,  and I thought, man, I've got to let these guys know about this.  The stupid luge.  Yeah, all right, man.  The two-man luge.  It's a dumb and dumber haircut, too.  Dumb and dumber, yeah.  Can you throw the hat back on so we can do some radio?  We can do radio.  I've got my new hairdo.  I don't want to keep my new hairdo covered.  Hairdue.  Fucking idiot, man.  I love it.  All right, we should talk about Club Soda Kenny. 
[01:41:00]  God, we have so much to do.  What a pain in the ass.  We have too much to do.  Hi.  Poor Kenny.  Yeah.  Someone on TV, all just moping around.  Usually when you see Kenny, he's smiling and happy.  Hi.  It's so good to see you today, handsome.  What can I do for you?  And then he's got like some advisor, lawyer.  I don't know what he is, the guy that's with him.  And he's just kind of walking behind him, kind of looking all apologetic. 
[01:41:30]  He's got a First Amendment lawyer.  Is that what he got?  There was an article in the New York Times yesterday in Club Soda Kenny.  As serious could be, his picture is being taken in front of an American flag.  For the people that haven't heard, Club Soda Kenny is a very good friend of ours.  Yeah.  We met him through Dice, I don't even know, five, six years ago probably.  We met Club Soda Kenny about the time we met little Jimmy Norton.  Jimmy.  And he's been a real friend for many years. 
[01:42:00]  He helps us out a lot.  On the road, takes care of us.  Just a great guy.  A great guy.  And he got in some trouble.  Someone want to explain, Jimmy?  Well, he's a decorated cop.  A lot of people didn't know he was a cop.  It's not something he talks about.  He's kept it completely separate.  We all knew, obviously.  I'm a cop, you idiot.  Yeah.  And he did occasionally, he would do stand-up comedy.  I don't think he was ever paid for it.  I mean, he's not great at it.  It was just, it was like a pressure valve release. 
[01:42:30]  He would talk dirty jokes on a stage.  And years ago, Dice would call him up out of the audience to come up and tell some silly jokes.  And it was just, you know, just a thing he did, like a hobby.  Some cops blow off steam by punching their wife in the face when they get home.  Dude, absolutely.  Or they drink.  Yeah, drink.  And others maybe go up on stage and blast out a few jokes.  And his whole purpose when he did it was to be as shocking as possible.  Over the over the top.  That was more the gag than the jokes he was telling.  It's not, it's not, you can't take the jokes that he was telling in the context of just him speaking. 
[01:43:00]  It was the shocking thing.  And people are saying, well, you know, the whole shock comic, like when Dice was doing it and stuff.  This is 50 times worse than what Dice was doing.  It's just like that type of thing.  And it was his delivery, the way he looked, and what he was saying that was so shocking.  That was the bit.  And he was so menacing on the stage, no one was going to tell him to shut up.  No.  That's what was so funny about the whole thing. 
[01:43:30]  You couldn't believe you were watching it.  It was a goof.  The whole thing was a goof.  Right.  It was like an ironic thing with just dirty jokes.  It was just this big horse's ass on stage with a joke.  It had to be that outrageous for the act to work.  Yeah.  He couldn't go up there and tell mediocre jokes.  It would just be like, this guy sucks.  But they're so bad and so over the top and so, like, such black comedy that that was the gag.  And that's what made it funny to watch.  Yeah.  And the more I read about this, the more I, the more the West Orange Police Department just looks ridiculous. 
[01:44:00]  I mean, you guys look ridiculous.  Just some guy who got blown off steam in his personal life, not even using his real name, telling dirty jokes.  You're going to take his pension away from him.  It's just mind-boggling.  And we weren't sure the last time we were on the radio, but they have now officially charged him with all sorts of stuff.  Oh, yeah.  All sorts of stuff.  Threatening to fire him and take his pension away.  Yeah.  He's been on the job for well over 20 years. 
[01:44:30]  Oh, yeah.  Almost 25.  Almost 25 years.  Almost 25 years.  He's shooting for that 25-year pension.  And they're looking to, you know, after how many years he's been there, take it all away.  Like, everything he did before that was shit because he was telling a few dirty jokes on a stage.  And some ass was in the audience, I guess, at the Laugh Factory, someone that had it out for him.  I'm very suspicious, by the way.  I'm really wondering who was the one that decided to rat out Club Soda Candy.  They're saying it might have been someone that had a problem with him. 
[01:45:00]  Well, he's internal affairs.  Yeah.  So you make a lot of enemies on the police force when you're internal affairs.  Could be somebody busted who saw him online or heard about it.  It could be somebody busted or it could be a cop who he fucked with or anybody.  The guy saw his act and anonymously got a copy of the act, which is a little strange, and sent it in and got him in a world of hurt.  And now he's the poster child for freedom of speech in the First Amendment, which is, no offense to our pal, is really funny. 
[01:45:30]  The New York Times picture is really, really funny.  Oh, Jesus.  Look at him.  All this show is that big head with a shadow on half his face and the American flag in the background.  Freedom.  He could look more serious.  It's amazing.  And the Times, everybody seems to be taken aside because it's such an obvious thing.  It's mind-boggling.  The police department just has to back off.  You're wrong about this one.  You're wrong.  You're wrong.  This has some legs, like we've said last week, I guess. 
[01:46:00]  He's going to end up on Sean Hannity.  Now that it made the Times, Sean Hannity is going to be calling and wanting to have Club Soda Kenny and his lawyer on the show.  People scrutinize what cops do in their off hours because technically a cop is never off duty.  They have to keep up that decorum during 24 hours a day.  But they are due a private life, a personal life, some way to enjoy themselves, hobbies, things to blow off steam. 
[01:46:30]  And this was one of the things.  And this is what Kenny did.  He didn't do it as a police officer.  He did it as Club Soda Kenny under an assumed name.  Never addressed the fact that he was a cop.  And I think police are allowed to have a personal life.  Are you going to start firing cops for what movies they like watching at their house, things that they like doing in the privacy of their bedroom, stuff like that? 
[01:47:00]  I mean, the guy never – he always made a point of telling everybody, you know, don't let on that I'm a cop.  This is a separate thing.  Kept it separate.  I think that should absolutely bail him out of this.  It's really embarrassing for that police department that you're going after a guy for naughty language.  What if he was reading poetry that was – I mean, this might sound like a dumb example, but what if he was reading poetry that was political in nature, that was completely disagreeable with your philosophies at the police department? 
[01:47:30]  Is he not allowed to do that as a citizen?  I mean, I understand you're a police officer all the time.  But how about this?  He wasn't doing anything illegal.  No.  He was, in his own time, telling naughty jokes for free in an adult nightclub that was booked.  Cringe humor.  Because cringehumor.net books that show.  It's cringe comics.  That's what you do there.  Everybody walking through the door knows that's what they're getting.  That's why they go.  Right.  It's not like he's doing what he says in his act. 
[01:48:00]  No.  He's just – like I said, it's so over the top.  And that's the gag.  That's the gag is that it's so over the top.  You know what he does on the road?  He's a bore.  He gets your coffee and he calls home.  Hello, son.  He's a fucking family man.  He does nothing fun on the road.  He's not a wild guy.  And they had not one bad thing to say about his over 20-year record on the police force.  It was nothing but good comments about what he did on the job. 
[01:48:30]  He was a great cop.  Yeah.  I was talking to him yesterday.  There's a couple things going on.  He has a new slogan.  Uh-oh.  It's called ONA All The Way.  I like it.  It rhymes.  ONA All The Way.  Remember that.  And then he goes, when it's time to tell my story, it'll be an exclusive on your show on XF Sile Radio.  Oh, well, we get the exclusive.  It would be really funny if Kenny went on Howard. 
[01:49:00]  You know, that phony motherfucker.  And then he goes, ONA All The Way.  Okay, so the news is all over it.  It made the times yesterday.  That's pretty huge.  Yeah.  And they've had to deal with this freedom of speech shit.  Like, you know, even the news who probably finds his act repulsive, which it is, you can't.  You just can't silence a guy because he's doing dirty jokes in a nightclub.  I'm sorry.  You can't punish him and take away his livelihood.  No.  There's a couple people that disagree with us here.  Okay. 
[01:49:30]  Ron in D.C.  Ron?  Fair enough, sir.  Fair enough.  Fair enough.  How's it going, guys?  Hi, sweetie.  Ah, you don't know what you're talking about.  Dump, dump, dump.  I can't handle anyone not agreeing with me.  I'm a retired sergeant from D.C. police.  Okay.  And I worked in internal affairs.  And it seems to me that this police department that Kenny works with must be small time.  Yeah.  And they don't have a whole lot to do.  I mean, when I was with IAD, we were locking up policemen who were running drugs, running guns for gangs, involved in murders. 
[01:50:00]  And I'd just like to go on record as to say that in more cases than not, internal affairs will clear a police officer rather than, what they say, jam him.  I mean, if you've got a policeman that's out there running guns for a gang, he needs to be jammed.  Yep.  He needs to be locked up.  Yeah, I've heard that one.  Yeah, they jammed him up.  He's jammed up.  Yeah.  Something like this with Kenny is bullshit.  And I got to say, that West Orange police department must have nothing to do. 
[01:50:30]  I agree.  All right.  Okay.  Well, I would...  Oh, sorry.  Thank you, buddy.  I'm just trying to...  You cut him off.  I'm just trying to get a few people in.  That wasn't a dump or anything.  Damn you.  Smitty in Jersey.  Hey, what's going on, fellas?  Hey, man.  Hey, I'm on the job in Jersey.  Let me tell you, I can't go out for a drink.  I can't do anything anywhere near where I work because everybody's got something to fucking say about what the cops are doing when, you know, we can't do anything.  Well, he didn't do it in West Orange, by the way, either.  He was in New York.  He was in Manhattan. 
[01:51:00]  Yeah, but you guys are nationally broadcast, so that doesn't help anybody.  Yeah.  Yeah, but it's still, like, when you're dealing with a cop's private life, I understand there's a code you have to adhere to because you are a police officer, 24 hours a day, blah, blah, blah.  But, again, the activity was completely legal.  The setting was completely appropriate, and he wasn't moonlighting.  He did nothing wrong.  Mm-hmm.  Nothing.  What if he was in a play?  What if he was in a play playing a pedophile?  Let's see, he's an aspiring actor, and off-duty, he goes to a community playhouse where there's an audience, and he gets up there and plays the part of a pedophile and, you know, takes his bows, leaves the stage. 
[01:51:30]  What about that?  Is there a reason to fire him for that?  What?  It's ridiculous.  You can't do anything without somebody having something to say about it because you're held to the highest case.  I can understand if a cop goes into a bar and he starts getting drunk and he's grab-assing on chicks and starting fights. 
[01:52:00]  That's one thing of being off-duty and kind of putting a black mark on the police department.  But when you're just doing something that you like doing, it's a hobby, it's harmless, it's completely legal, I don't understand.  They have no right to fire the guy and take away his pension. 
[01:52:30]  That's right.  Thanks, fellas.  I'm punching out.  Thanks, man.  All right.  Thanks, Smitty.  Why is comedy so much different than if he was just playing the part of a despicable person?  It's always, why was Lenny Bruce arrested and yet Richard Widmark in the 40s played a guy who pushed an old lady down the stairs in a wheelchair, which was great.  But, I mean, Richard Widmark played a cop killer, a murderer.  You know what I do to squeal is I give it to him in the belly and yet Lenny Bruce for telling naughty jokes is arrested.  There's always been a double standard for human. 
[01:53:00]  Let me tell you something, though.  I would like to see Kenny push an old lady down the stairs in a wheelchair.  Or play a pedophile in a play because he's not a good actor, I imagine.  That would really be funny.  Why have I been cursed with this desire?  I don't know.  I don't think prison will help.  I feel these urges.  I'm going to make him an offer he can't refuse.  Cut.  By the way, the pictures of Jim Norton are up on opianthony.com.  Already?  Of his brand new haircut. 
[01:53:30]  Hairdo.  Hairdo.  There it is.  It's not too bad, right?  I look very handsome in my new haircut.  Yeah, you sure do.  Go to opianthony.com and see what Jimmy did to his head.  It's, hey, who's that guy with the fancy hairdo?  Was a soup bowl used?  No, it was just me.  Really?  Looking at pictures of cool people.  All right.  Guys, let's play some of the news reports on our pal Club Soda Kenny here.  Fox 5 here in New York.  A suspended police sergeant is defending the raunchy comedy act that got him in trouble. 
[01:54:00]  Now, by day, John Federer works for the West Orange Police Department.  But by night, he is Club Soda Kenny.  Now he's on the brink of a...  How funny is...  And not the situation.  I really feel for the guy.  Very serious.  I want this to work out.  Nothing but the best for Kenny.  You know, we're having fun with this, but the guy is shitting a brick.  It is so funny to hear his fucking name like this in the news.  Especially since, like, normally when they intro somebody like that, it's for a string 
[01:54:30]  of rape and murderers.  Right.  By day, he's a lawyer.  By night, he's the fucking...  The hillside strangler.  But no.  Yeah.  By night, he's got his back, man.  Club Soda Kenny.  Yeah, it sounds like a...  He was out with Vinny the Nose last night, beating black people.  And they found the dead body with a lime in its mouth.  A true calling card of Club Soda Kenny.  Two little straws were plunged up his nose, and a lime was in his mouth. 
[01:55:00]  He's the swizzle stick killer.  All right, back to Fox.  Burping was heard in the area that Club Soda Kenny struck at.  Back to Fox 5.  He's on the brink of losing his job and his pension.  Police supervisors say that they're outraged that Sergeant Fetter was cracking jokes about  bestiality and bladder control.  But Fetter's lawyer said that this is a case of free speech.  When he goes on stage, he goes on stage to entertain an audience. 
[01:55:30]  When he puts on the uniform, he holds himself to the highest standard and protects the public.  And we put out a call to the West Orange Police Department, and so far, we haven't heard  back, a departmental hearing is scheduled for next week.  So it's an ongoing story.  Next week, they have a little hearing.  Hopefully, you know, he makes out well.  At the very least, give the guy the pension that he earned putting his life on the line  for 20-some-odd years so he could support his family. 
[01:56:00]  Take that away.  How do you take away over 20 years of a guy's career, putting it in, life on the line for  telling some dirty jokes.  Dirty jokes.  Dirty, dirty.  Stop it.  Cops have the gallows humor.  They all, I don't think a cop would deny it.  Right.  It just comes with that job.  It's a fucking stressful, brutal job.  You're a target to be shot at.  Yep.  Constantly.  All right.  Here's News 12 in Jersey, I guess. 
[01:56:30]  A West Orange police sergeant was suspended without pay.  This after his bosses learn he's been performing as a racy stand-up comedian.  Sergeant John Fetter was also a guest on the popular radio show Opie and Anthony.  Right now, News 12 New Jersey's Michael Weber reports some of his material was no laughing matter.  Oh, my God.  We've got to sing a Christmas carol through the radio.  This is video from the comic Club Soda Kenny when he took a busload of homeless people  to the Palisades Mall. 
[01:57:00]  Do you know what?  They're showing him he already has more TV credits than Bob Kelly.  Do you realize that?  Dude, why'd you say that, dude?  I'll bite you.  Through the radio.  This is video from the comic Club Soda Kenny when he took a busload of homeless people  to the Palisades Mall for a radio stunt.  This is Kenny from a stand-up act, and as you'll hear, his subject matter is quite offensive.  You know the blacks take the best jobs. 
[01:57:30]  If Club Soda Kenny was just a comic, this wouldn't be that big of a deal, except Kenny  leads another life.  He's a sergeant in the West Orange police force.  Now he's temporarily often suspended after some of his bosses were sent tapes of his act  anonymously.  Agency policy that's consistent with state guidelines precludes me from commenting further  on this ongoing internal investigation.  We went to Sergeant Fetter's home.  While inside, he told us he wasn't talking. 
[01:58:00]  It would have been great if he just opened the door with that goofy look.  Hi.  Please come in.  Can I help you?  Just nude and draped on a flag like he's lost his mind?  Mi casa es su casa.  Naked in the flag.  With a fucking Statue of Liberty torch with sparkles coming out of it.  Let freedom ring, my friend.  But it figures that the news shows the racial joke.  This is all about being politically correct, and the department doesn't want to take any 
[01:58:30]  heat because he said politically incorrect things.  All inside, he told us he wasn't talking, but on the streets of West Orange, the people  he serves were.  He should have some kind of discipline done to him, you know.  At this time, it's hard enough, you know.  So, you know, maybe he'll learn from this.  Let's see.  Was he black?  This former city worker.  Gee, what a shock.  The black guy wants the cop disciplined.  The odds of that have to be 100%.  Jimmy could be more than that. 
[01:59:00]  It could possibly be everyone.  They found one supporter.  You can't see the video.  Maybe.  Are these going to be up on opianthony.com?  They should be.  Let me tell you what they...  News reports of Club Soda County.  They look for...  And I'm telling you, when I did the 2020 thing, they wanted people to be offended by what  I was saying.  Of course.  They look for a certain reaction.  Yeah.  Because everybody knows Kenny is right.  Even the news knows he's right.  So they've got to find some people for a counterpoint of view.  It's just like it seems more interesting.  Everyone knows the guy's right.  Well, the guy they found to support Kenny. 
[01:59:30]  Oh.  Ooh.  Yee.  Got to look like a drunk homeless.  Looked like he just stumbled out of a bar somewhere.  A city worker who says he knows Sergeant Better for years says, don't believe everything  you hear.  I like the guy.  He's a nice guy.  And, uh...  You think he's getting a bum rap here, or what?  Yeah.  We'll see if Club Soda Kenny will be able to go back on the stage and back on the force.  In West Orange, Michael Weber, News 12, New Jersey.  Depending upon the outcome of the investigations, Sergeant Fetter could be fired and lose his 
[02:00:00]  pension.  He's been on the force since 1984.  1984.  And they're just, uh, take away your pension because you told, uh, dirty Joe.  Take away the fucking money from his wife and kids because he told some dirty jokes.  That's good.  What...  Irrelevant thinking.  What do you get for 20...  Over 20 years, 22 years that you put in?  But that goes away because you tell a little joke about black people.  Or you make a little joke. 
[02:00:30]  A little off-color, uh, dark humor about kids.  Stop.  How about if he got shot?  What would he get then?  A fucking handshake from the mayor?  Yeah.  We got, uh, WB11 news in New York City.  All right, now to a story we, uh, first told you about last week.  A New Jersey cop and part-time stand-up comic is coming under fire for his raunchy act.  But it's no laughing matter.  All right.  Oh, with the no laughing matter.  Holy shit.  We get it.  We know it ties in. 
[02:01:00]  Oh, no laughing matter.  Segway.  Broadcast School 101.  Oh.  Laughing matter.  His suspension is quickly turning into a battle between free speech and indecency.  Why not?  Takes too long.  Too many trips.  Want a good laugh?  If you think this is funny, three jokesters doing a bit for Comedy Central on if all-you-can-eat buffets really are all-you-can-eat.  That's the buckets and the shovels. 
[02:01:30]  Check out the big guy.  His name on the comedy circuit is Club Soda Kenny.  He got it hanging out with Andrew Dice Clay, who in his act would say, get me a Club Soda Kenny.  You might put food.  But in New Jersey, his title is Sergeant.  John Fetter is a West Orange cop.  John Fetter is an entertainer, a professional entertainer, who is out there to appease an audience.  West Orange officials didn't find him funny and suspended the veteran officer of 22 years after receiving an anonymous tape of his stand-up act, 
[02:02:00]  where he jokes about having sex with his dog and molesting his son.  Based on the information that we received.  This is just like the crap that we had to deal with.  Oh my God.  I know.  You just don't want to hear it.  You watch this stuff going, oh.  Oh no.  I said that.  You know what?  Let me tell you something before you start that again.  Anything of that nature taken out of the exact context that it's put in is awful. 
[02:02:30]  Look, the guy is saying, here's a cop talking about molesting his kid and having sex with his dog.  That sounds horrid.  You put it in the context of this big oaf on a stage in front of a crowd that's expecting it under the name Club Soda Kenny,  not as an officer, and being so over the top, it fits.  That's the only situation it fits in.  And have you ever seen his dog? 
[02:03:00]  I mean, I'm not a fan of dogs, but there's something about that animal.  It's so fuckable.  You want to fuck it.  Yeah.  It's cute.  Yeah.  Like my new hairdo.  Let's say this this morning.  Kenny is a great father.  Yes.  Oh, yeah.  A great father.  That's what he does on the road.  He calls his kids and his wife, and that's what he'll say.  Hello, son.  Talk about school.  He's a bore on the road.  I mean, no offense, Kenny, but he does nothing.  You know, I'll let you in on a little secret.  I really don't think he was talking about his actual family. 
[02:03:30]  No.  His actual kid and dog and wife.  I really don't think he, uh, what was one of his jokes about his wife?  Comes on her.  She might be listening.  I mean, that was really a heinous joke, but.  I don't want to be in that household right now, so let's give the guy a break.  The truth of the matter is, it's an act.  Right.  He is acting.  Right.  The people he's talking about aren't real.  They are caricatures. 
[02:04:00]  Not his real kid.  Right.  Stop it already.  He's a great father and family man.  Sex with his dog and molesting his son.  Based on the information that we received, Sergeant Fetter was suspended without pay pending the outcome of the investigation.  The deputy chief wouldn't elaborate whether it was the material or whether Sergeant Fetter broke a moonlighting rule by taking on a second job without permission.  It's absolutely, unequivocally the material, and that's why it's a clear violation of Sergeant John Fetter's First Amendment rights. 
[02:04:30]  The cop with the jokes didn't crack a smile and wouldn't say a word.  It's serious business now.  His job is on the line, and his right to free speech is at risk.  Comedy routines go pretty far these days, and it seems to be sort of par for the course.  And I'd say it's protected by the First Amendment.  Speaking of routines, this is how this one ended.  Did you call the police?  Hey, guys, they just called the cops.  Right now we're making our getaway. 
[02:05:00]  So who will get the last laugh?  We'll find out when the department holds a hearing later this month on the 23rd.  I guess they got a lot of video of Opie and Anthony stuff and decided, oh, this is shocking.  Meet the creeps.  A cop actually saying the cops are here and we're getting away.  That was a joke, you asses.  How many fucking laugh, serious puns, word plays can they do on the fucking news?  We followed Club Soda Kenny down the sidewalk where he actually told people they had dropped something 
[02:05:30]  when indeed they had not dropped anything.  These people turned around to look and did look quite ridiculous.  Oh, poor bastard is just being hung out to dry.  Then there's the what time is it gag where he'll walk up to somebody on the sidewalk, ask them what time it is.  When they look at their watch, he simply walks away. 
[02:06:00]  Goddamn, that is funny to watch him do.  Hilarious.  What time is it?  Oh, it's and gone.  He's just gone.  Here comes Club Soda Kenny.  He's big and stupid.  Six foot five killer who skips.  And if the shoe fits, it's big.  Hope you're ready because here comes Club Soda Kenny.  Thank you.  You're welcome, Kenny.  See, that's going to be his intro when he gives us the exclusive.  The skinny.  The skinny. 
[02:06:30]  Yeah.  Because he now says O&A all the way.  O&A all the way.  Well, this is blown up.  It's going to get even bigger than this.  And, well, the view.  The view had to sit around and discuss Club Soda Kenny.  Great.  Those fucking hens.  And they're just so knowledgeable.  Are you ready for this?  It's going to enrage us.  Bang.  Bang.  Bang.  All right.  I want to switch gears, actually.  Let's talk about a gentleman named John Fetter. 
[02:07:00]  You may have heard of this man.  He's a 22-year veteran with the West Orange, New Jersey police force, but by night he's  known as Club Soda Kenny.  He's a comic in the evenings, and what he does is very off-color humor, a lot about rape and  pedophilia and bestiality, and the department just found out about this, and they've suspended  him, and they may fire him.  Do you think it's fair, or is it a violation of his First Amendment rights for the department  to say, hey, I want to predict.  I didn't watch this.  Yeah, I want to predict, too.  Let's see.  I think Barbara Walters will find him repulsive and kind of side with him, just because she's 
[02:07:30]  media.  Star Jones, black, forget it.  Completely gay.  I hear you.  They ought to find him.  But I'm a lawyer.  I'm a lawyer, though.  Oh, is she a lawyer?  She's a lawyer.  That's what she says.  I don't know.  Maybe she isn't.  Okay.  Blackness trumps lawyer.  I think blackness trumps...  Yeah, yeah.  And who else?  They got the mom in there.  Joy.  I like Joy.  I think Baylor's a comic.  She'll be behind him.  I think Joy will be behind him.  She's on TV, though, so she won't. 
[02:08:00]  I met her behind...  I think she might.  But when she's not on TV, she's a lot different than...  Yeah, she might have some balls.  She's a stand-up.  She's a stand-up.  So you're hoping that she would defend.  What's the matter, Than?  Don't tell us.  I won't.  I just want to...  I'll kiss you.  ...interject that Star Jones couldn't make it because of the snow, so she's not part  of this discussion.  You fucking...  Oh, she's not?  Who couldn't get into work?  It was a flight thing.  A flight thing.  What?  Big C-130 couldn't drop her ass...  Ah, she's not fat anymore.  Damn it.  Damn it.  That doesn't matter.  She's still got a huge head.  She's still a fatso in a little body. 
[02:08:30]  Big, fat head.  With a face that looks like it's melting.  She's just awful.  And then...  Seemed like a good idea at the time to...  Sometimes, you know, you can get your stomach stapled and it works out for you.  Other times, man...  Other times...  Your head looks like it's melting.  She's Foundry Music's star.  Star from Yellowstone.  Steve got the stomach stapled and he looks proportional.  Yeah, he looks good.  There's nothing wrong with him.  But then you see the Star Jones and her face looks like it's melting right away.  Ew, did you hear me just be the hole?  You said fucking he got his thing.  I'm like, he looks good. 
[02:09:00]  I just chimed in with nothing.  He looks good.  He looks good.  Oh, Irby.  What?  Oh, no.  And the last member is the survivor girl from The View.  She's the last.  All right.  What about Meredith?  Is she there?  She's the ringleader, yes.  Meredith, I say her being a mom, the soccer mom type woman of the whole thing is just going  to be repulsed and thinks he should be killed.  So it's Meredith, Barbara, the fucking survivor hole, and who else?  Joy.  Joy.  And Joy.  It's going to be a clean sweep. 
[02:09:30]  No, I think Joy is going to be the only one that supports.  No support.  Here we go.  Do you think it's fair, or is it a violation of his First Amendment rights for the department  to say, hey, we don't like what you're saying, even though you're doing it when you're off  duty?  I believe you're not allowed to moonlight without the permission of the department.  So that's how they would get him.  That's in his contract.  That's breaking.  But there is something.  How do you know that's in his contract?  Yeah.  You're on an island getting bitten by bugs and eating stupid shit.  You're not an expert on this.  Everyone's an expert in the law.  It was in his contract.  Did you read his contract? 
[02:10:00]  They do have microphones.  They are little.  Good point, Anthony.  Good point.  Once you've got a mic in front of you, as we know, you're right.  True expert.  You're right.  So that's how they would get him.  That's in his contract.  That's breaking.  But there is something that could be called, and we have it ourselves.  His is called conduct unbecoming an officer.  To the department.  And some of his routine talked about, I'm reading it, raping a bride at knife point and molesting  his own five-year-old son.  Is that funny?  Not to me, but we don't know the whole context.  I mean, Chris Rock in the old days used to do jokes about date rape when I'd be standing 
[02:10:30]  there and saying, Chris, it's not funny.  And Rick and Pryor did everything.  And so it depends on how it's done.  But they were.  We don't know what the jokes were.  But an officer supposedly has a somewhat, that's a question.  Well, you're not a comedian.  Yeah, who was the whole that said, is that funny?  Yeah, to some people it is funny.  Besides, it's supposedly a word.  Right.  Dumb fucking Barbara Walters.  You've been in the media for 40 years.  Supposedly.  She can't speak.  She's got the weird lip.  I know.  I just wondered who Richard Pryor is.  Richard Pryor. 
[02:11:00]  I never heard of Richard Pryor.  Fucking dope.  Is that funny?  Well, to some people it is.  That's tough shit.  And hot.  Especially because they're dealing with those issues as an officer.  Often with women getting raped or children, child abuse.  So, and here he is making jokes about it.  Yeah, so maybe making jokes about it takes the fucking stress and strain off of it.  Instead of dealing with it.  Oh, someone hits on that?  Just you wait, Anthony.  Thank you, Than.  Abuse, though.  And here he is making jokes about it.  You don't know what he said.  You can't judge the guy until you hear the act. 
[02:11:30]  No, I'm just saying.  I can see the department feeling that was inappropriate material.  But they didn't hear it either.  Given his job.  Yeah, they did.  They got a tape of it.  Oh, now they got a tape of it.  They have a tape of it.  But just even on paper, I just don't see how doing what he does, that can be remotely funny.  Of course you don't.  But other people find it funny, you hoe!  Jesus.  Holy God, it drives me fucking nuts!  Of course.  Just because you don't find it funny, that's fine.  But you know what?  People do find it funny.  People think if they don't find shit funny, it ain't funny. 
[02:12:00]  It ain't funny.  That drives me nuts.  You hear Joy Behar going to bat for him, though?  Yeah.  As a comic, of course.  And I'm relieved that she, because it's a weird situation that she's in, because she's  got a lot of fat housewives watching her every day.  But that other stupid survivor bitch.  What do you expect, dude?  And then she said, did you hear her?  She goes, oh, they had a tape of it.  And she goes, well, a tape, but even reading it on paper, I see that.  Right.  Like you wouldn't get a little more out of it watching it in the context of an act as 
[02:12:30]  you would read as a transcript that looks like a serial killer confession.  And that stupid survivor hole, she might find some things funny that I don't.  I'm sure everything she finds funny, I would find not funny.  And I find her show offensive and awful.  But I'm not going to question that.  If you find it funny, well, you know, laugh yourself silly.  Great.  Silly.  Great.  But to think that I don't find it funny, so it's not funny, bad attitude drives me nuts.  She's a fucking hen. 
[02:13:00]  Who cares?  She's a cackling, kvetching twat.  There are people out there that will find my hairdo to be unstylish.  As remarkable as that is to people here to hear.  I'd call them crazy.  They're nuts.  You know what that show needs?  A cock.  Yeah.  A guy that just sits there and goes, oh, now.  You know what that show needs?  A fucking padlocked door and a fire.  How doing what he does, that can be remotely funny.  Not at all.  I want to hear that again, just so I can be annoyed again. 
[02:13:30]  Because I cannot believe how people think sometimes.  It does.  Given his job.  Yeah, they did.  They got a tape of it.  Oh, now they got a tape.  They have a tape of it.  They have a tape of it.  Just even on paper, I just don't see how doing what he does, that can be remotely funny.  Not at all.  I don't think it's funny.  There are limits to all comedy also.  But the audience usually tells you if you've gone over the edge.  And the booker will not book you there again.  So it's, you know, it's kind of capitalistic.  I wonder about the humor in the police department itself.  Because, Barbara, you can attest to this as well.  In the newsroom, whenever there is a tragedy, the jokes start flying. 
[02:14:00]  Because people use it as a release.  And if you ever walked in a newsroom right after something horrible, you would be in shock.  And Wall Street, too.  And Wall Street.  That's where usually the jokes start.  That's right.  Notice Barbara's not touching that one.  Yeah.  Well, I like the fact that was raised, though.  And the fact that it's even in the newsroom.  And that it wasn't the police department.  It's in the newsroom.  You know damn well when they get that footage of the fat person that jumps off the fucking roof and splats on the sidewalk.  That they're all goofing on it.  They're in there mixing and cutting and doing things going, hey, get Bob. 
[02:14:30]  He loves this shit.  Look at the splat.  Look how many times you think this guy bounces.  I'll bet you.  That's what they do.  It's to deal with the fact that you're looking at something god-awful.  That's where usually the jokes start.  That's right.  Is Wall Street.  So it's a very offensive comment.  It's offensive, but in a strange way, it's a relief.  Right.  Exactly.  Well, maybe that's what this cop is doing.  I mean, we don't know.  We have to be there.  And I'm not defending pedophilia jokes. 
[02:15:00]  Right, exactly.  Because I don't do them.  They did a pretty good job with it.  Yeah, not bad.  Pretty good job with it.  Just, oh, that stupid survivor.  What do you expect, dude?  She's a fucking reality show pig.  That's funny.  I don't know how you could laugh at that.  I don't find it funny.  You should see me jerk off to it.  Stupid.  Good for Joy Behar.  Fucking going to bat form.  Good for her.  Fucking true comic.  Our joke quote is going way up this morning because we have to deal with the horrific hairdo.  I don't like that type of an adjective. 
[02:15:30]  The words, as I said before, stylish, fashionable, handsome, and hip are the words you'll use for my hairdo.  Let me tell you something.  It's not only fashionable, but I'm noticing functional because it clears the way for your headphones.  That's right.  That is now perfectly seated.  Your headphones, nothing, no hairs in the way.  Dude, this is what you got to do.  Get the camera.  Take the headphones home with you.  Grow in the hair, and then just cut out the hair. 
[02:16:00]  The round part around the headphones.  That would look silly, O.  That might look silly.  Or it looks completely normal until you take your headphones off.  It's fine.  Wait, go ahead.  Not yet.  What are you doing now?  Oh, okay.  Oh, God.  I aims to kill you with it.  Let's say hi to Ass Marshmallow.  Good boy.  Yo.  What's up, Ass?  Um, so should we assume that Keith the cop might not be around for a while?  Or?  He doesn't do anything unbecoming an officer, though, dude. 
[02:16:30]  A lot of times it's just to make sure nothing goes wrong.  Yeah, he's helping with security sometimes.  That's right.  All right.  Don't worry about that.  All right, well, there you go.  It's an ongoing story.  It's going to blow up.  It's going to blow up on our pal club, Soda Candy.  And we'll wait for the hearing next week and then the exclusive.  O&A all the way is his motto.  Do you know there is a weird part of me that would love to see him almost lose because then  he could sue, and I would love to see him take those fucking idiots for millions. 
[02:17:00]  That's like a civil rights vote.  I would love to see him just drain their assholes in the civil court.  It is freedom of speech, man.  It's a really big issue.  All right.  On the way, the bad boy of figure skating did an interview for NBC.  How do they judge you as the bad boy if you're the one guy who is HIV negative?  Oh, he must be a Brooklyn thug, this kid.  And still haven't talked about Dick Cheney. 
[02:17:30]  And the post was so ridiculous yesterday with their coverage.  Do we have the post from yesterday?  Could someone get that?  They wrote the story as Elmer Fudd talking.  Yeah.  You're a newspaper.  My whole take on this, when it happened, and I saw the news reports on it, when we came  on and did the show, right after it happened, I said, they are totally making this sound  like it's a lot less serious than it really is. 
[02:18:00]  And now it's coming out that that is absolutely the case.  And fuck Dick Cheney for not commenting.  He's not commenting.  No one, from what I hear, the investigation's done.  This is something that would be, if it was anyone else, this ongoing investigation, there  would be a grand jury, there would be, I mean, you fired a shotgun and hit somebody.  Hunting accident.  All right.  It's got to be investigated.  And watch how they use language.  Oh, yeah.  It's done all the time in the media. 
[02:18:30]  All the time.  We talk about how Fox refuses to use certain words, and they'll use something else that's  a little softer, not as harsh.  Like, suicide bombers, what are they called now?  Well, a lot of people will call them homicide bombers.  Homicide bombers.  You know, well, they mess with language all the time on TV.  And with this case, they're saying that this lawyer got peppered.  He got peppered?  He got sprayed.  Sprayed?  Sprayed.  No, he was shot with a shotgun. 
[02:19:00]  A shotgun blast.  And then he had a little setback.  He had a minor heart attack.  Silent heart attack.  Silent heart attack.  Shh.  No, there's a pellet that is resting up against this guy's heart.  One of, they say, between 50 and 300 pellets that could be in this guy.  Like, they can't even count how many.  And apparently some of them moving around.  One of them got either near or in his heart. 
[02:19:30]  They took him back up to intensive care.  They're going to leave the pellet there, hoping what?  It doesn't move anymore.  And they're all like, no, this is, it's okay still.  Don't worry about that.  78 years old, you sneeze.  It's a threat to your life.  This guy's shot with a shotgun in the face, face, chest, neck, and head area.  I do an axe with a little monkey.  I put him in a dress and beat him senseless.  He shot in the face, the neck, the chest. 
[02:20:00]  And it wasn't, you know what, I'll tell you what peppered is.  I got a little hunting experience.  Peppered is when you fire off your round.  The blast goes up, and the pellets fall down and hit you.  There's no velocity left from the actual shotgun blast, from the gunpowder.  The only velocity in those pellets is now gravity.  It's gone up.  It's coming down.  You hear, like, on yourself, like you're being hailed on. 
[02:20:30]  But gravity can be a little scary, though.  Yeah, a little bit.  A little bit, right?  Now, something, if you were hunting on Jupiter, you're dead.  Because those things, ooh, they'd go right through you with the gravity there.  What about the moon, though?  The moon?  No.  Even less damage than here.  Well, no damage at all, right?  When they kind of start floating away?  The moon does have some gravity.  Some.  It's like a sixth.  So you'd get a sixth of the impact of it just falling.  Mars, same thing.  Did you know that, Jimmy?  What?  Not only did I not know it, but nobody listening to this show knew it. 
[02:21:00]  I hate that.  I hate his knowledge.  And then he tries to dumb it down for us.  No, I just heard that.  Did you?  Did you?  I'm 37.  I have ears.  Why did I never hear that?  Watching some show?  No, it's amazing, too.  I never graduated from high school.  No.  I didn't need it.  A high school dropout.  He's like, you know what?  This is boring to me.  Kids, you don't need high school.  I already learned this shit when I was a lot younger.  I just want to tell that message to the children.  So it's a sixth.  Yeah, sixth of the gravity of the moon.  I would have just said a little less.  A little less. 
[02:21:30]  It's not quite the gravity.  One-sixth.  I love that we finally call you out on this, because for a very long time, Jimmy and I  would just look at each other like, you don't know either, right?  And then we just would be like, yeah, the silent nod of two dopes.  Didn't you grow up during the lunar landings and the Apollo program?  It was very exciting to me.  And I listened to everything.  The fractions.  I just knew, ah, it's not as great as Earth.  When Alan Shepard teed off and fucking hit a golf ball on there, they were all about how  little gravity is. 
[02:22:00]  I'll tell you this much.  Jupiter, no idea that it's a lot worse.  Oh, it's a shitload.  No idea.  Here's a rule of thumb to go by.  I knew it probably was worse.  The bigger the mass of the planet, the stronger the gravity.  So something like the moon, which is very small in mass, has less gravity.  Got it.  Something like Jupiter, which is very great in mass, has a lot more gravity.  And also Jupiter spins.  Let's not get into the spinning thing again.  Let me tell you something.  Spinning has nothing to do with gravity.  Yes, it does with the gravitational pull, because Jupiter's days are 10 hours. 
[02:22:30]  It's 1,000 times the size of the Earth, and it spins in 10 hours.  So the gravitational pull is much stronger.  No, it would, actually, if any theory here, it would be weaker, because the centrifugal  force of the spin would try to propel you away from the planet itself.  So if it was spinning really fast...  No.  The sun, the sun spins and keeps the planets around it.  It's like a best of again.  No, no, but the sun...  Boring.  No. 
[02:23:00]  Boring.  But wait, I have a fact.  The sun spins and keeps all the planets around it.  The centrifugal force isn't pushing the planets away.  The sun isn't spinning to keep the planets around it.  That's how the planets stay around the sun.  It's gravity.  No, the sun is such huge mass.  Boring.  Boring.  Hugely massive, more than any other planet.  Boring.  Boring.  That its gravity holds all the other planets in orbit.  Boring.  Right, but the spin has something to do with the amount of gravity.  Boring.  Boring.  Boring.  Snap out of it, guys.  Snap out of it.  Jupiter will crush you.  We're talking about Dick Cheney.  As you're going on to Jupiter, it will crush you. 
[02:23:30]  Boring.  Yes.  Because it's spinning so fast.  Because of its mass.  Both.  All right.  We're talking about Dick Cheney.  These guys will be talking about gravity on PAL Talk tonight.  So now peppering would be it falling on you.  Okay.  That's being peppered.  And people who hunt a lot do get peppered by the pellets.  He was shot.  It doesn't go into your chest cavity by falling out of the sky.  The power of the powder was behind the shot that went through him and into his chest cavity, 
[02:24:00]  neck, and head.  And there's some kind of cover-up going on.  Yeah.  They were trying to make it less than it was.  They took a lot of time between the time it happened to the time that a lot of people  were notified, one of which was the press, one of which was the president.  The president didn't find out until later.  And he wasn't informed by the vice president, which would have been a great call.  Yeah.  George.  Yeah, it's Dick.  Oh, yeah, the trip. 
[02:24:30]  Well, that's what I'm calling about, the hunting trip.  I shot somebody in the face, chest, and neck.  I thought you want to know.  How do you make that call?  Were you probably thrown in the middle?  It was great.  I mean, we had good weather.  The food was good.  I thought I shot somebody in the face, neck, and chest.  We went out for dinner.  He hoped he doesn't catch it. 
[02:25:00]  We got some exclusive audio.  Oh.  See, because we do our own research here.  We do our own investigation.  Right.  Proving that it was a lot worse.  What audio is this of?  I believe it's after the shotgun blast.  After the blast.  And we're, I guess, Dick and the gang trying to get him to the hospital.  To the hospital?  Yes.  Wow.  And there was a mic?  Yes.  The man must have been crying in the back.  It was sad.  Wow.  Let's hear a... 
[02:25:30]  I'm scared of shit out of me, Larry.  I'm going to die alone.  I'm going to get you a doctor.  The doctor's going to fix you up.  And you're going to be okay.  Now, say it.  You're going to be okay.  Say it.  You're going to be okay.  Say the goddamn words.  You're going to be okay. 
[02:26:00]  Say the goddamn fucking words.  Say it.  Okay, Larry.  Correct.  Correct.  A little different, huh?  Wow.  The vice president was using some salty language with that peppering.  He was driving, too.  That's odd.  Driving.  Well, here's the New York Post from yesterday.  Friend was delirious calling him Larry.  Yeah.  You want to describe the cover of the New York Post from yesterday?  They did a little Photoshop.  Very cute.  They have Elmer Fudd. 
[02:26:30]  They think of Photoshop, by the way.  Yeah, I know.  They have Elmer Fudd's big hunting hat and his jacket and his shotgun, all cartoony.  And then the vice president, Dick Cheney's face, superimposed where Elmer Fudd's face would be.  And what's the headline?  This is a huge headline.  A newspaper here in New York City.  Waskulls.  Quiddics blast the White House for veep delay.  And they spell quiddics.  Quiddics.  Oh, yeah.  It's C-W-I-T-I-C-S. 
[02:27:00]  And blast B-W-A-S-T.  Read the first paragraph because then they get into the story.  The White House took heavy flack, oh, they didn't say flack, yesterday for waiting a very, very long time.  At least commit to the whole story.  Do the entire article like this or don't do it at all.  A very, very long time before revealing that Waskulli vice president Dick Cheney had shot a fellow hunter. 
[02:27:30]  Victim Harry Whittington.  I'm Harry Whittington.  Hi, Harry Whittington.  My name is Harry Whittington.  I've been shot.  Get me to the chopper.  Hi, this is my wife, Mrs. Whittington.  Reported recovering quickly from the Elmer Fudd type accident.  Oh, yeah.  What happened?  Did the vice president shoot him in the face and his bill spun around his head?  He put it back in place and said, you're despicable. 
[02:28:00]  In which he took more than ten shotgun pellets to the cheek, neck, and face.  When Cheney shot him while aiming at a quail on the Texas ranch Saturday night.  What a dope.  Word didn't leak out until Sunday.  So they were really trying to kind of keep this quiet.  Yeah.  The vice president shot someone with a shotgun.  I tell you, although it is beautiful today here in California, the weather back east has just been atrocious.  Unbelievable.  There was so much snow in Washington, D.C. 
[02:28:30]  Dick Cheney accidentally shot a fat guy thinking it was a polar bear.  That's all.  All right.  I knew these guys were just going to be all over this.  I guess the guy's going to be okay.  But when the ambulance got there out of Forrest-A-Habber, they put Cheney on the stretch.  He's going, no, the other guy, the other guy.  That's funny.  Cheney's defense is that he was aiming at a quail when he shot the guy.  Which means Cheney now has the worst aim of anyone in the White House since Bill Clinton, apparently. 
[02:29:00]  Oh, good.  A cum joke.  A cum on the dress joke.  A cum on the dress joke.  Very funny.  Good news, ladies and gentlemen.  We have finally located weapons of mass destruction.  It's Dick Cheney.  No, that's not bad.  So over the weekend, the vice president wants to go bird hunting.  He's going quail hunting or duck hunting or something like that.  And, you know, horseplay, how that breaks out when you're out there hunting.  And one thing leads to another, and he shoots his buddy. 
[02:29:30]  But here is the sad part.  Before the trip, Donald Rumsfeld had denied the guy's request for body armor.  No.  That's the crazy part.  But.  Honestly, I don't know what all the fuss is about.  What's more American than shooting your hunting buddy in the ass?  The way it goes.  We.  We can't get bin Laden, but we nailed a 78-year-old attorney. 
[02:30:00]  That's the way that works.  But.  The guy who got gunned down.  This buddy of.  He.  He is a Republican lawyer and a big Republican donor.  And fortunately, the buckshot was deflected by wads of laundered cash. 
[02:30:30]  So he's fine.  All right.  That's good.  Now, that was really good.  And it's like, I just wish Letterman would afford stand-ups.  The same freedom he just took.  He's making fun of a guy who was shot in the face and possibly is going to die.  Now that this guy had a silent heart attack, they're not going to be making any jokes anymore.  No, no.  And Jon Stewart touched on that yesterday.  Did he?  On the Daily Show last night.  He was talking about the incident, making some jokes about it.  And then he said the guy suffered a heart attack.  So he brought down the humor scale and said this went from hysterically funny up at the 
[02:31:00]  top of the scale of red to kind of sad but still funny.  And if he dies, it just gets lower and lower on the humor scale.  But right now, still funny, but a little sad and scary.  I do want to talk a little bit before the show begins tonight with two things.  One, a correction.  One, an update.  Last night, we reported on the program that the Vice President of the United States had  shot a man, 78-year-old man Harry Whittington, in the face because he thought the man was 
[02:31:30]  a burr.  I would very much like to correct that apparently the man was shot pretty much from here all  the way up to the face.  Sprayed.  So if we gave you the impression that it literally just like, no, it was really.  The other is an update. 
[02:32:00]  Unfortunately, earlier today, the birdshot that the Vice President had used to shoot  the man actually lodged in the man's body.  The birdshot lodged in his body and actually went into his heart and caused him to suffer  a minor heart attack.  Mr. Whittington is doing fine.  But based on this development, we're going to downgrade the condition of the story from  incredibly hilarious to still funny, but a little sad. 
[02:32:30]  Incredibly hilarious.  Yeah.  Very funny.  All right.  We'll go to break with more Letterman.  He did a really good job at this whole thing.  Thank you, folks.  And happy Valentine's Day.  By the way, good news.  Good news today.  So far, Dick Cheney has not shot anybody.  I'm telling you, this is all anybody's talking about.  Dick Cheney over the weekend, him and a couple of buddies go down there and they're hunting  and they're horseplay, they're goofing around. 
[02:33:00]  And the next thing you know, he guns down a buddy of his.  And I'm thinking to myself, if this story gets any bigger, pretty soon they're going to  have to tell the President.  Well, I think.  But, you know, after the story, you find out more and more details.  Well, it turns out now that Dick Cheney did not have a license to hunt.  Did not have a license to hunt.  And coincidentally, it turns out we didn't have a license to go into Iraq. 
[02:33:30]  Did you hear that?  But, the real question now is, is this a one-time thing or will the Vice President try to kill  again?  But it's Valentine's Day and I hope you folks are having a lovely Valentine's Day.  And everybody is in the Valentine's mood.  For example, earlier today, Dick Cheney shot his buddy in the ass with an arrow. 
[02:34:00]  All right, you're checking out the Opie and Anthony program on XM Satellite Radio.  Mark has something to say and we'll explain.  Mark, what's up?  Oh, what's going on, bro?  Hey, man.  But why don't you guys have to take a shit or something?  No, I know what happened.  We've only taken two breaks so far.  And we had to make up for that.  And also, we're trying to sync up with XM Canada today. 
[02:34:30]  So, we took an extra long break so we can make that happen.  Sorry.  Yeah, I was going to say that.  That was like 10 minutes long.  Yeah, don't panic on us.  We were drinking the airplane foosball.  It was great.  Yeah, every once in a while, we're going to take a long break.  But don't worry about it.  Sorry about that, man.  No problem.  We just want to sync up because we're going to do something with Scott and Cam from  XM Canada in a few minutes here.  Chris in Brooklyn, what's up?  How are you doing, guys?  Hey.  Just wanted to let you guys know.  I know you guys use Internet Movie Database a lot. 
[02:35:00]  Your pests are everywhere.  I mean, on the Howard Stern, you know, just his regular page, on private parts.  I can't even get onto his site.  They're probably getting slammed by you guys.  It's awesome.  The pests have pretty much taken over the cyber world.  And a letter made it to Entertainment Weekly about a week ago, and we explained that the  pests, they're fighting battles that we don't even know about.  Not all of them come to our attention.  They're out there on message boards we don't even know about, just fighting battles.  I'm telling you, they're six, seven, eight pages deep. 
[02:35:30]  It's just great.  I made my first little, you know, contribution today, which was nice.  Awesome.  And I just wanted to let you guys know I loved you for years.  Jimmy, you're awesome.  Thank you.  But what about me?  I'm sorry?  Well, you're under you guys.  Yeah.  Oh, it's great.  I mean, it's a good one.  But I want my own personal...  You didn't mention Opie's name.  Oh, Opie, I'm sorry.  But what about me?  Opie.  It isn't fair.  Oh, I'm so sorry.  Moving Pictures, 1982.  All three of you guys.  Brooklyn love you.  Opie gets...  Opie gets...  Hey, Chris, can you give us... 
[02:36:00]  You're right.  Can you guys give out phone number more?  Yes.  I mean, I don't know if maybe it would be better if you can get a hold of DirecTV, because  I get you guys through DirecTV.  Oh.  Well, they should have that number up on the DirecTV thing.  You know, I hit the info button, and I don't have it.  I got it through the computer, but some people aren't that savvy.  That's what I love about satellite radio and regular radio, whatever you want to call  it, commercial radio.  You had to give out the phone number all the time, but with these displays, it's just  there and ready to go.  What is the number?  I don't even know.  I haven't said it in so long.  I think it's...  Is that...  It's the one that's on the display now?  866-WOW-WOW. 
[02:36:30]  Yeah, right.  Okay.  What?  Wow.  Yeah, if you can even get those guys to put it on the info button, it'll be perfect.  Oh, you know what?  It's 866-WOW-1-WOW.  Sorry.  Wow.  Wow, then the number one, then wow.  866-WOW-1-WOW.  Don't spell out one, obviously.  You guys are the best.  The virus is spreading.  Rock on, guys.  Hey, thanks, guys.  Thank you.  Thanks for calling us on the Pharrella phone.  I'm glad...  But that's cool, though.  The DirecTV, he gets us on the Pharrella-vision.  Ugh.  It's like...  Shut up. 
[02:37:00]  I'm not laughing at that.  Oh, no.  That isn't.  Yes, it is.  What?  Yeah.  What?  Get that fucking bottle of piss out of here.  What's the matter with you?  You lunatic.  Jimmy's lost his mind today.  Why?  Why did you...  It's a water bottle filled with Jimmy's liquid.  Why did you do that?  The question is, why didn't you?  Oh, you can see the yellowness. 
[02:37:30]  Get that picture up on okayanthony.com.  No.  Don't roll it over.  I swear someone will die.  Let's play toss the bottle.  No.  Let's not.  No.  Oh, it's warm.  Jesus, that's so gross.  Throw it at Anthony.  No.  No, I can't throw it at Anthony.  Do you swear?  Get away from me. 
[02:38:00]  Dude, it's only tinkled.  It's very sterile.  Anthony's hiding.  Holy shit.  How about if I just roll it this way, like this?  No, get away.  Do you want me to just...  I know what I'll do.  No, shut up.  How about if I place it on your neck?  Oh, my God.  It feels so good.  Hawk?  Oh, my God.  Put it on your neck.  We got...  The bottle's clean.  From Good Morning America, we got a report on germs, and it's about a radio DJ.  Yeah?  I'm thinking it might have been you that was on Good Morning America, by the way, Anthony. 
[02:38:30]  No.  It was warm.  You are disturbed and disgusting.  That's my insides, how warm I am.  Walk into the bathroom during the last break, and every stall was taken with people, I guess,  on this floor taking a dump.  It was like the fucking starting gate at Belmont.  Some guy right now...  I hear a bell.  It smells like rust.  His shit smells like rust.  It was so bad.  So bad in there.  Why do you have to suffer?  Bring Francine in, too, by the way. 
[02:39:00]  I don't know.  Just because someone doesn't have self-control, and they had to have a chili dog, drink milk,  and eat grapes last night, we all have to suffer today.  We all have to suffer with a...  Right.  The guy that has no fucking pride, doesn't care what you hear.  Because you had to eat all your Valentine's Day chocolate with cheese and milk.  We have to suffer today.  Right after your milk and burrito dinner.  Right.  The only way...  I hate that when you go to a sporting event.  I'm like, you selfish...  No, it happened at CES.  Oh, great.  You have no self-control, so now we all have to smell what you ate last night. 
[02:39:30]  The only way I will use the bathroom for the number two in there is if I know it's going  to take a minute to complete everything and come out looking like a submarine.  Just, you know, whoosh, it's out, it's done, I'm finished.  I'm not going to sit there as you spray salad and pudding all over the goddamn bathroom making  sounds that are ungodly. 
[02:40:00]  Is that a blast or a peppering?  A peppering, yeah.  Oh, he just peppered the toilet bowl.  No, he didn't.  No, he blasted it.  A full blast.  We're going to talk to, what, XMT?  What are you doing?  Thank you.  That is unsanitary.  Why'd you make the intern?  Now he can sue us, I think.  Who told him to do that?  Sue you.  All right.  XM Canada, are you there?  Oh, hello.  Hey, what's up, guys?  What's happening?  It's Scott and Cam from XM 204.  XM Canada.  Nice.  Somebody set up this silly phone call, huh? 
[02:40:30]  Somebody had to do it, yeah.  Oh, and here we go with the delay problem.  I can tell already.  There's a little delay, but they do that.  I can tell already there's going to be a little delay.  We watch it every night on CNN.  When they go to Iraq, there's a little delay, so you just got to expect it.  They're professionals.  We're professionals.  I think we can get over this.  Are you guys in Toronto?  Yeah.  And what do you guys talk about on your show?  Hockey?  Yeah, talk about hockey.  There's a parade across Canada right now, guys, because Canada won their first game beating  Italy at the Olympics 7-2, so there's a national parade all across the country from 
[02:41:00]  the West Coast to the East Coast.  You know what?  Unless they beat them 28-0, I wouldn't be too proud.  No, that's the women's team that does that.  We beat them 16-0.  The ladies got hammered.  You guys really beat Italy 16-0?  The ladies did.  Oh, yes.  What about the...  Wow.  The Americans are kicking butt, too.  They're all over everybody, but...  Of course we are.  We're going to take it.  It's always Canada and the States in the finals.  Wait, wait.  But explain.  I can't imagine Italy actually has a good hockey team.  They're all Canadians on the team. 
[02:41:30]  Are they really?  How do they know?  That's the thing.  There's nine Canadians on the Italian men's team, and there's two American Italians on  the men's team as well.  So it's pretty much a North American team, not just Italy.  Yeah, but what are they, the hockey players that couldn't get on the real team?  You know, Canadian, American.  Yeah, that's right.  They couldn't make Team Canada, or they're playing in Super Leagues over in Italy and  Germany and all that stuff.  Yeah, if you're on the Italian hockey team, that's like being on the XFL football league,  you know?  It's like the football players, yeah, that weren't quite good enough. 
[02:42:00]  Italians are known for pasta and murdering each other.  They don't play hockey in Italy.  I know.  They really don't.  Well, at least you said the XFL.  You didn't say the Canadian Football League.  No.  We're hurting Canada now.  We've got to play nice for a little while.  Yeah.  And then we'll take our shots at you.  Trust me on that one.  We have said nice things about Toronto, though.  Well, NBC was doing the Olympic coverage last night, and they did a whole thing on  love, and it's really weird because a lot of these people are switching teams because 
[02:42:30]  they fell in love with somebody else, so they blew off their citizenship to now be part of  the Italian team.  That's odd.  It's really, it's very strange, just because they fell in love with someone at the Olympic  Village in a past Olympic or something.  Yeah, there's a Canadian figure skater from Kingston, Ontario, just outside of Ottawa a couple  of hours, and she skates for the U.S. now because I think something happened there.  Is she any good?  Uh, on the ice?  Yeah.  Yeah.  No, no, she's a medal contender. 
[02:43:00]  What other hockey teams are good?  I guess Russia's got to be pretty good.  Russia's great.  Slovaks.  The Slovaks are good.  The Swamps.  Sweden.  Yeah, anybody.  Scandinavian countries, Canada.  I don't know about the States this year, but all those countries.  We're going to do all right this year.  We're playing today, right?  I hope they do.  I think we're playing today.  Yeah, that's right.  Latvia, although beat up on Latvia, that's a no-brainer, but other than that, we'll see  how they do.  You heard about that one time we won way back in the 80s, right? 
[02:43:30]  Yeah, 1980.  We're just saying that today, guys.  Come on, that was pretty good, right?  26 years ago.  I think a lot of people have started to forget about that.  We just don't get the sense that Americans are really too into their hockey team this time  around.  It's our strive for two.  What do we call it?  Trying to get a rally going here?  Yeah.  I love watching Olympic hockey, though.  It's much more exciting than the NHL.  They've got to just open up the ranks.  I understand one of you guys is an Islanders fan, so of course you're looking at the Olympic 
[02:44:00]  Hockey as perhaps a step up.  That's hopey.  Hey, what am I supposed to do?  Be a fair, you know, jump on another bandwagon?  Drive for five.  I've been an Islander fan since they won all those cups back in the day.  That's right.  There's nothing worse than a bandwagon jumper, so you're not a fan of an expansion team or  anything, so that's cool.  I'm a mighty Ducks fan, and I have been for 15 years.  Because he looks cute in his jersey.  That's right.  I like the clothes.  Now, Gretzky, what's the deal? 
[02:44:30]  I'm hearing he's being cleared of any wrongdoing?  Well, the latest was that he could be cleared by it.  The fact of the matter is, no charges will be pressed against anybody that was involved  in making bets through it, it looks like, right now, anyways.  I guess Tuesday's the day for Rick Tockett and the two other guys to get called on the  carpet there, but I guess that initial report that came out out of Jersey there that said  that they had him on the wiretap talking about his wife, apparently there was really 
[02:45:00]  nothing to that, actually.  Yeah, you don't want to tarnish the great one's image, but just the fact that you have to  say, hey, I didn't say anything on the wiretap, that's just bad right there.  I don't think I have any wiretapped conversations of myself, you know?  I think if you have a wiretap, that kind of tarnishes your image.  And it looks like...  We can tell you, Gretzky didn't bet, okay?  No.  I know that's the bottom line.  I know he's your hero.  No, but I know.  It's all about Gretzky and Canada. 
[02:45:30]  Everybody throws their money at Super Bowl bets.  No, I can tell you Wayne Gretzky didn't bet.  Somebody around him might have bet it, but he didn't.  Right, the LA Kings' own Wayne Gretzky.  It looks like his wife might have a gambling problem.  Oh, hey, hey, hey.  No comment, no comment.  Right, no comment.  She might have done something.  Hey, you'll have to talk to her about that.  I like how he kind of brushes that off.  You get his hand on the phone.  Hey, I don't know.  I cut the grass.  I take out the garbage.  The dishes and windows, you're going to have to talk to her about that.  All I do is gamble and play hockey. 
[02:46:00]  Oh, I fucked up.  Oh, you messed it up.  That is kind of funny, though.  I said that.  That would be funny if he said, I never bet on anybody except my own team.  So what do you guys do?  What do you guys do?  Just all hockey?  Yeah, yeah.  24-7 hockey.  We'll talk any sports with you, though.  That's the difference.  Just as we're from Canada, you can open it up.  Any sport, we'll talk.  All right, curling.  Yeah, what's the curling about?  How's the Canadian curling team doing?  That's just one of those sports where you realize you just run out of stuff to do in the wintertime. 
[02:46:30]  You've seen the Simpsons curling for loonies.  Curling is a drinking sport.  When you're done, people go and they drink after curling.  That's why Canadians like it.  What is curling?  I just wanted to know a little history of it.  It's like shuffleboard at the bar.  You throw some rocks, and the rocks that are closest to the center, you get points.  I've played the shuffleboard at the bar where you take the cheese shaker,  and you kind of spread that stuff all over, and you've got to kind of lag the puck  so it just hangs over the edge or it gets into a scoring zone. 
[02:47:00]  Is that what they're doing with that big, stupid iron-looking thing?  That's exactly what curling is.  Yeah, just try to get it as close as you can to that dot that's right in the middle  and hope that your rock is the closest one to the middle dot.  And can they turn this thing and adjust the speed by brushing with the broom in front?  Oh, yes.  You bring up good points.  That's what it is.  It's all about the brushing there.  The quicker you sweep, the faster the rocks go.  Yeah, what country has the top-secret broom they were talking about last night? 
[02:47:30]  Are you kidding me?  It has a top-secret broom.  Apparently Canada.  It is Canada.  Canada's got some secret brooms.  Oh, yeah, they used to use wooden ones.  We have some, like, Kevlar bulletproof brooms now.  Yeah, you can get some nice speeds on those rocks.  Technology.  It's a stupid sport.  Curling.  They don't have to, you know, it's pretty bad when you can wear the same thing for curling  that they wore, like, back in 1908 for curling.  Like, every other sport.  The ladies look nice.  Every other sport.  The ladies wear the kilts.  They're wearing kilts.  Oh, they look good.  Don't kid yourself.  When the women get curling, that's a different story. 
[02:48:00]  The men got bad slacks and bad looks.  Wait a second.  But the women look nice.  Wait a second.  Have you seen Dordie Nordby from Norway?  She's Norwegian.  You're saying the women look good?  I'm talking about most ladies.  You know, I can't get back-passed the sexy name Dordie to even get a good glimpse of her.  It's like every other sport, though.  You look at ski jumping, which I love.  But you watch the old black-and-white footage where they take off and swing their arms around and spin.  And they've used aerodynamics and computer-generated simulations to get the best and the most out of their sport. 
[02:48:30]  Curling is like, what are they going to do?  Hey, we could kind of change the shape of the broom.  You know, it doesn't quite.  It's not a 21st century sport.  What does Dordie do?  Is she a curler?  Dordie Nordby is a famous skip from Norway, yeah.  She's not exactly, well, I'm not going to say I'm Tom Cruise either, but the fact of the matter is, I don't know.  Don't take a look in the mirror.  Let's just say it.  Dordie has a dick. 
[02:49:00]  That's facts, yes.  Yeah, you guys a lot of curse on your channel and stuff?  No, no, we're not.  But we're with you guys now.  We don't have the same rules you guys have.  You guys are our neighbors here on XM, so I guess we've got to be nice to you.  We're 202 and you're 204.  That's right.  We're close.  Hey, what about the luge-ing?  The luge-ing's for suckers.  I think that's a stupid sport anyway.  These guys are, if you want kicks, go grab a roller coaster.  I'm not for luge.  I think it's pretty dumb.  Two man's kind of sexy, though.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, two man. 
[02:49:30]  That's great.  Nothing like those skin-tight outfits.  No, we don't play bum darts on 204.  Are you just happy to see me or what?  Yeah, they go ball bag first.  We were trying to think if their unit gets in the way and makes them, you know, slower.  Yeah, if it either slows them down, like, because they're wearing pretty much saran wrap.  You get nothing left to the imagination.  Well, they actually lock together like Legos.  The one guy will cut a hole in the back of his uniform, and the other guy cuts a hole in his front,  and they clip together like Legos, and they play chariots of fire as they plummet to their depths at 200 miles an hour. 
[02:50:00]  It's the one sport where smaller's better.  Yeah?  You think so?  Sure.  Didn't you say bigger's better?  I was thinking bigger might be better because based on aerodynamics, the lower pressure over the top of the unit,  used like a wing foil, could actually lift some weight off of the tracks and make them go a little faster.  That was true.  All losers would be black.  All right. 
[02:50:30]  We just want to say hi to you guys today.  Yeah.  Hey, what's happening?  Scott and Cam.  And thank you for standing on guard for thee.  We really appreciate that.  Yeah.  Our neighbors to the north, and they stand on guard for thee.  Canadian losers.  We're not Canadian losers.  Don't kid yourself.  Channel 204.  204.  What time is your show on?  We're on from 6 to 9 in the morning.  6 to 9 in the morning, then the repeat's on from 9 till 12 noon.  You got to talk about hockey for three hours every day?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:51:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wow.  We'll dip into the AHL.  Any league.  It's crazy, man.  Any league.  Oh, no.  You know what the crazy thing is?  We have Canadians aren't our listeners right now.  We got fans.  The people who listen to the show are from Carolina.  Carolina and Nashville are the emails we get the most.  Really?  Really?  Which is crazy, yeah.  And a couple guys from Jersey, too.  That's got to be a little scary.  All right.  That's scary.  Well, thanks, guys.  We'll do this again.  It's Scott and Cam XM 204, right?  Yep.  All right.  Oh, Canada. 
[02:51:30]  Thanks a lot, guys.  That's all I know.  Later, guys.  Take care, fellas.  Later, guys.  Go USA.  All right.  We're going to get our asses handed to us.  No, we're not.  We're going to do fine.  The picture of Jimmy and his bottle of urine is up.  Why?  Let me say it, Hawk.  That's a little light, Jimmy.  A little light?  Yeah.  You might need a few more vitamins in you.  No, it's supposed to be clear.  Yeah?  Sure it is.  If yours is gold, you're in trouble.  No, it's not gold.  I think the darker the urine, the more waste you're expelling. 
[02:52:00]  No.  The darker the urine, the more likely you are to go bye-bye in a box with no kidneys.  Believe me, your urine is supposed to be clear and drinkable.  Yeah.  Huh?  Yeah, we should bring Francine in.  Oh, that picture is great where you're sucking your chin in and it's a side view of...  No, I'm not.  A side view with your sporty new hairdo.  Thank you.  At least you recognize finally that my hairdo is very sporty.  It is.  It's all up on opianathony.com.  All right.  We got some audio.  The bad boy of figure skating. 
[02:52:30]  There is no such thing.  No.  The bad boy of figure skating.  And Francine has just entered the studio with Valentine's Day gifts.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Happy Valentine's Day.  Look.  I would...  Look, if I put this on my head, I'd have a hard-on.  Ha ha.  You know.  A perellophone.  Ha ha.  You know.  Kind of funny when you play with words like that.  Happy Perel-a-tines Day.  I was riding around.  I had hard-ons all over the place.  I was eating chocolate.  Cheek it up.  Cheek it up.  I'm the man.  You're the man.  I'm the man.  I'm the man.  Shut up. 
[02:53:00]  Shake up my fucking cock with your mouth, douchebag.  Flop Sweat.  Hey, O&A all the way.  How's it going, guys?  No.  Let's not start that.  Hey, I'll be in.  By the way, there's another part of that quote.  Kenny just emailed me.  It's O&A all the way.  That's what I say.  That's what I say.  Go USA.  And then you throw in Haywood Nelson.  Hey, hey, hey.  Hey, hey, hey.  I hope I still get my pay.  All right.  What do you got, Flop Sweat? 
[02:53:30]  I was just going to say, I give it six months before you guys are enemies with 204 over  there.  You think there'll be lobbing shells over the border?  It all starts nice with a phone call, I got to tell you.  There's actually a phone call that exists of Anthony and I talking nice to Don and Mike,  and then that turned ugly.  So you might be onto something, Flop Sweat.  But I love you guys, so keep up the good work.  All right.  Thank you.  We're trying to talk about the bad boy of figure skating here.  Thank you.  This is our Olympic coverage, by the way.  Our Olympic coverage break. 
[02:54:00]  I was actually hoping there'd be chocolate in here with a fatso I am.  It's very sweet.  It's a heart.  It says, I love you.  And a receipt, too.  All right.  How much do we owe you, Francine?  Nothing.  It's, uh, yes.  A little, uh...  What am I supposed to do with this?  Pillow type thing.  You got a boxer, too.  And then there's, um...  Boxers.  Woven cotton boxers with hearts on them. 
[02:54:30]  Yes.  And a little underwear hanger.  Do people have a little underwear closet that they hang it up?  Who are these people?  Oh, it comes with a gift receipt?  Awesome.  Thank you.  How...  You're welcome.  What do you mean, Ope?  I hate it.  You don't hate...  No.  What?  Oh, those look really comfy.  Boxers.  Don't they look great?  They look fantastic.  I will walk around the house in these.  Mine are red.  Thank you.  Oh, look at these.  Do you know how delicious my hog is going to look in these? 
[02:55:00]  Wow.  What intern needs money?  Lieutenant, do you need money?  What?  Stan's doing fine.  Who needs money?  Where's Tim?  Balloons!  We have balloons!  I figured they'd be better than chocolates.  Here's Tim.  He's our intern.  He lives in his car.  He has a family.  He comes from Springfield every day.  It's three hours each way.  Right, Tim?  Yeah, that's about the story here.  He commutes from Springfield, Mass. 
[02:55:30]  Really?  Massachusetts every day.  That's why I wasn't afraid of that bottle of pee.  You live in your car.  You get my special gift.  How do you actually live in your car?  I'll be.  I'll be.  That's terrible.  During the week?  Yeah.  Wait a minute.  But you drive to Springfield?  Well, that's where I live on the way.  Yeah.  And he showed up yesterday because no one told him we were off.  You have a home in Springfield?  Yes.  Oh, okay.  You drove here yesterday?  Yeah.  You don't remember this guy?  He comes from Springfield every day.  Like I remember any of these people. 
[02:56:00]  It's three hours each way.  Here, here's the.  Dude, this is cannon fodder.  That's what the fucking interns are to me.  Cannon fodder.  Here's the gift receipt.  You can get, what, $15, $17 now?  $14.  Well, actually, something like that.  Ooh, I like my balloon because I can do this.  There you go.  Thank you.  Tim, that's free money.  All you have to do is find an express and get some gas money.  Oh!  You broke it.  No!  Thank you, Francine.  You're welcome.  Opie.  Hey, Opie, you gave away, uh. 
[02:56:30]  Can I see the balloon?  I hope, you know, it took me a long time to pick out these gifts.  I know.  I want to play like that.  That's fun.  You're going to hurt my balloon.  No.  He got a t-shirt.  I want to play.  I want to bang.  I used to be a drummer.  Please.  Okay.  Right?  I love my balloon.  Oh.  No!  Opie.  Don't pop my balloon.  Opie.  No.  There you go.  No.  Do you understand?  That was, that was, me and Ed can hold him up.  Look, this is Lance Armstrong before and after. 
[02:57:00]  All right.  Let's, let's get back into some radio here.  Thank you, Francine.  Hang out, though.  You're welcome.  Or, hold him again.  What?  Betty Ford.  Come on.  Let's do Olivia Newton-John.  I want to get animal.  Do you? 
[02:57:30]  All right.  Listen.  I should have got a physical.  Physical.  I should have got a physical.  Looking at the one that's left, I'm hopelessly devoted to you.  How do you even know that song?  Sandy, what happened?  Sandy.  Why is the tissue in this one? 
[02:58:00]  Francine, do you have a crush on a staff member?  Ben and I were talking, and he keeps teasing me about how I have a crush on Earl.  Ew.  I know.  But he's a, I mean, do you really like Earl?  No, I don't.  So I told him back in NW, I had a really big crush on Steve.  Ew.  Steve?  Yeah.  Ooh, big bear.  Get Steve in here.  Ooh, wow.  Grr. 
[02:58:30]  Yeah.  Grr.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  It just...  You had a crush on Steve?  Yeah.  Is that before or after you stole a hat from the mountain climber in The Price is Right?  Hold on and hold on and hold on and hold on.  Steve.  What?  You're not going to believe this.  Do, do, do, do, do, do, do.  Here comes Steve.  Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  It really is emasculating.  I love the steam music. 
[02:59:00]  That's right.  It is not.  See?  Yeah.  Francine had a crush at you at the old place.  Really?  Yeah, he did.  I'm flattered.  Thank you, Francine.  We got on her when she was jailbait.  Wait, wait.  Was this pre-stomach stapling 400 pound me?  Yeah.  Oh, you like the big guys.  Really?  I don't mind.  Yeah?  I'm really small.  So big guy, as long as he's not, you know, the big F word, fat.  I don't care.  Well, I was.  You don't mind a big husky guy.  That's why he was.  I was a despicable fat guy. 
[02:59:30]  No, you weren't.  He was a fatso.  Yeah, I really was.  He was fat.  Back in the W?  Yeah, he was a little fat.  Yeah, we've seen pictures.  I didn't think he was fat.  Well.  I thought Steve was okay.  Wow.  And what was it about Steve?  His size, what else?  Steve looked at me once.  That's all it takes?  I got eye contact?  Wow.  Yeah, and I got that feeling.  Ah.  A little damp?  Yeah.  Ooh.  A little bit.  A little bit.  A little mushy.  Ooh.  Yeah, and I thought maybe he winked or something, so. 
[03:00:00]  Something about your eye.  I know.  Hey, good looking.  What's cooking?  That's exactly how it's articulated.  He winked.  Did you get, like, a little damp?  Like, did the underwear kind of go up in?  Like, when you ride a bike, the way your underwear rides up in your crack?  Mmm.  Yeah, I did, actually.  Yeah?  Yeah.  And you thought maybe, did you fantasize about Steve and you?  Of course I did.  You did?  Yeah.  We had a sex.  Did you ever masturbate thinking of Steve?  Maybe.  Oh.  Home alone, in bed, a little lonely, and then my hand wanders, and you've got to come up 
[03:00:30]  at a fantasy, and Steve ever pop in there and help you out?  Of course he does.  Excuse me, let me help you.  Let me dig in here for some honey.  Yeah.  Get to the old honey pot.  Oh, wow.  There's a revelation.  Really?  We're doing revelations on the show today.  Yeah, walk us through one of these dreams.  That's Steve back at N.E.W.  Oh, my God.  Holy shit. 
[03:01:00]  Yeah, you're right.  Holy fat fuck.  He wasn't fat.  He actually has the tattoo of the flag on his arm.  It's the fucking one that used to hang on the Verrazano.  All right.  There comes the suicidal urge for the day.  Oh, my God.  You forgot it, Steve.  You don't like that, though.  You forget how big you used to be.  No, I don't ever.  Jesus.  Holy crap.  Wow.  You were a problem.  Yeah, I really was.  Holy shit.  Oh, that's unbelievable.  Anyway, Francine.  Look at your gut.  I know.  It's awful.  It's awful now.  No, it's not, Steve.  No, no, no.  The empty gut that I'm constantly working out to get rid of. 
[03:01:30]  So, Francine, what was your fantasy about Steve?  Yeah.  Yeah, how would that play out?  Because I know you girls don't just, like, pop the image in your head and get ripping.  Like, there's got to be a storyline to it.  So, what?  You were up at the station.  Maybe after the show.  Was there a little get-together?  You saw them outside the building.  What happened?  What's the scenario?  Well, the scenario would be I would stay a little bit late, you know, trying to help 
[03:02:00]  out with the crew after work.  Yeah.  And then Steve would be the only one left.  So, it'd just be me and Steve.  This is a fantasy.  Yeah.  And, uh, I go to the recording studio where Steve is.  Yeah.  And I knock on the window.  Knock on the window.  No way.  I'm busy.  I'm making a Ramon promo.  Not any W.  No.  No, Ramon didn't exist then.  So, uh, you knock and Steve lets you in. 
[03:02:30]  Yep.  And, uh, what happens?  We'd work a little bit later and I'd help Steve with some voiceover work.  Oh, so, so there's some, hello.  So, there's some little things like, uh, could you grab me that cart over there?  And, uh, oh, could you bulk this for me?  Yeah.  And things like that.  And you're just kind of doing a little busy work, helping Steve out.  Yeah.  And during that time, uh, what are you talking about?  Um, stuff.  Um, just, but, but it's got to be stuff that kind of lets him know that this is a little 
[03:03:00]  more than just working, helping out.  No, we wouldn't talk about it.  Nothing.  No.  Strictly work.  Yeah.  He's just like writing code that makes video even more impossible to find.  Thank you.  I'm not going to get an email about that tonight.  Thank you.  And then we eat Chinese.  It should be called lostlymusic.com.  Oh, man.  Wow.  See, instead of found.  Yeah.  Wow.  And I fucked up the.  Oh, my God.  Well, let me. 
[03:03:30]  Hold on.  I'm not done.  I'm not done.  I'm not done.  I'm not done.  Oh, Jesus.  You get a real gorilla crash.  All right.  Lost.  Stinker.  Lost cuddly.  Would Steve have sex with you?  Of course he would.  Now, how do, wait, wait.  You go right to the sex.  It's still working.  Hold on, scud.  For God's sake.  Who cares about the, how do you migrate from work conversation to intercourse?  So is work done?  At some point you finish up and you leave the studio?  No, we're not going to leave the studio. 
[03:04:00]  All right.  How does it go from helping out to having some sex?  Well, we're both going to say we're really, really tired and we should go.  All right.  It's like, oh, I'm tired.  Been working all day.  Yeah.  We're going to go, yeah, yeah, I'm tired.  Yeah.  And after eating Chinese, too.  What?  What Chinese does that?  They always eat Chinese a few minutes ago.  Oh, I missed that.  It's kind of like fucking Jungle Fever.  Wesley Snipes and Annabella, whatever the fuck her last name is.  Yeah.  That's how you two are.  Yeah.  So then things, we get a little heated and steamy.  But how does it get heated? 
[03:04:30]  You go, you're tired.  Where's the move?  There's a move.  You need the move.  There's the move that takes it from you're working in the studio, could be anybody just  working in the studio.  There's a line that crosses to now there's something happening.  Now my penis is in your snatch.  What happened?  So he gives you a look.  The look again.  And the look isn't, help me out with this piece of tape or get me this or something.  It's like, hey.  It's the I want you look.  Oh, Steve, can I see that look?  Wait, wait.  It was me giving it or you giving it?  No, you gave it to her. 
[03:05:00]  You gave it to her.  The look you give was she.  Wow, Steve just gave the look.  That's the look.  Oh my God.  I thought that was, I have to go to the bathroom.  Yes.  Yeah, it might have been.  Most people interpret that as you being retarded.  But she, she picked it up as, I want you.  I want you, Steve.  All right, so he gives you the look.  Give her.  Yeah.  And the look is just, you know, the eyes down a little bit.  Look.  Yeah.  Squint.  Maybe a little pouting.  Does he, does he come over to you now?  Yeah.  So he walks over to you and you know now what's coming. 
[03:05:30]  Mm-hmm.  A mauling.  So, so he, he, he walks over to you.  Yeah.  And what is the first romantic thing that happens?  First thing.  Does he put a ring through his nose and then dance for you?  No, he'll give me a little massage on my back or something.  With his muzzle on, knocks you off the chair until his trainer has to pull that rope.  Love that clip.  I love being here.  I hated Romania.  He rides a unicycle. 
[03:06:00]  You talk about how your people have been treated badly.  He talks about how his people have been treated badly in circuses.  You two kind of bond on that and he gives you the pouty look, that stupid look.  Gives you the look, walks over.  What's the first thing?  He'll give me a little neck massage.  Oh, so a little neck massage.  You've been helping out.  You're a little tired.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So a little neck massage.  And you, during this massage, maybe you'll let out a couple of groans of pleasure. 
[03:06:30]  Yeah.  Because it feels, a neck massage feels good.  What would that sound like?  What?  That's it.  A little more.  Okay.  You're getting more of a massage.  Just shut your eyes and make believe and make those sounds.  Yeah.  You're getting massage.  Steve, that feels good.  All right.  Ooh, Steve, that feels good.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  And then how does that turn into a little more?  A little massage. 
[03:07:00]  So he's behind you right now.  Yeah.  Uh-oh.  So then he'll go down a little bit lower.  So now he's massaging your lower back.  Your lumbar.  Your lumbar.  Let me get the, you know, the lumbar is the most neglected part of the massage.  Fucking nervous idiot he is with all those awful death rings.  Yeah, those must feel good.  Yeah.  You're lucky I waxed my knuckles this morning.  So he's massaging your lower back.  Mm-hmm.  And this feels better.  This feels really good.  And now it feels like, now it's not just the massage. 
[03:07:30]  Now maybe you're getting a little turned on because you're kind of, it's getting closer  to areas.  Yeah.  You know.  So now how does that sound?  Now he starts massaging you.  Shut your eyes.  And a little, now a little pleasure.  Hmm.  All right.  That's a little more.  All right.  Sounds a little sexier.  So then he'll, he'll, he'll, he'll lift the shirt a little bit.  Oh, because that was over the shirt.  Now the shirt lifts up a little.  What are you wearing during this?  What's on your top, your bottom, everything. 
[03:08:00]  What are you wearing?  Uh, shorts.  Ooh, shorts.  And a t-shirt.  A t-shirt.  Uh, you have a bra on?  Yeah.  You have your bra on.  And what type of panties are you wearing under your shorts?  Um, probably a little thong.  A little thong.  And is it peeking out a little over the top of the shorts?  Yeah.  A little nasty, little dirty girl.  Showing your undies.  So he's massaging and, uh, he lifts your t-shirt up and goes underneath your t-shirt.  Yeah.  Now he's massaging your, your back. 
[03:08:30]  Yeah.  Those meaty alabaster fingers.  Oh, just going at it.  Lebanese fingers just kneading away like it's dough.  And, uh, what, what happens next?  Well, then he'll go up a little bit.  Oh, now he's going back up.  Back up, but still on your back.  All right, we get it.  You got a massage going.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right, but I'm kind of, I'm kind of seeing where this move is going.  He's going for the bra.  Right.  He goes up.  Now he's under the shirt.  Now the bra comes off. 
[03:09:00]  So he unsnaps the bra.  You show no resistance to this at all.  So he knows now it's not just a massage.  I'll show a little bit.  What do you do?  It's called the oopsie.  Oops.  Do you play oopsie with him?  Like, oopsie.  Do you have a front snap or back?  It's going to be back snap.  It's going to be back.  So he unsnaps.  And what do you do?  You go kind of like, Steve.  Yeah.  Steve, where are you?  This is all taking place in the workplace as well?  Yeah.  This is on the, yeah. 
[03:09:30]  Way to make it sexy.  Well, the console is sexy.  Does Jeremy Coleman peer in and go, ugh?  Yeah, or go, I thought it was my massage time, Steve.  Steve.  Steve.  All right.  So you just go kind of like, oh, Steve.  Yeah.  But do you do the thing where you put your hand on your breasts to kind of hold the bra from falling?  Like, Steve.  Or does he say that it's just to make it easier for the massage? 
[03:10:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, there you go.  Do his big claws rip the bra?  Or does he gently unbutton it?  No.  Belly warmer.  And here he is when he thinks she's protesting.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  No, no, no.  I'm just.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  I was.  Grr.  All right.  Now, no more hard to get.  No.  So what are you doing?  What happened?  I have to show a little bit of resistance because I like to play the resistance game. 
[03:10:30]  Uh-huh.  Pepper spray.  No?  No.  Play Massa.  Okay.  No.  Yeah.  Does he have on a white wig and high stockings and black shoes?  No.  All right.  I've taken you out of the plantation today for just this occasion.  Oh, President Jefferson.  So he does that and you show a little resistance by doing what?  What do you do?  Um, I'll probably just say no.  Verbal?  Yeah, let's hear the no, though.  It's happening. 
[03:11:00]  How is the no?  Get into the role.  I'll say no, Steve.  I don't think we should.  I don't think we should.  Now, this means she doesn't think we should, but she didn't say she doesn't want to.  Of course.  Right.  What does Steve do?  I don't think we should.  Steve's just going to continue.  Yeah.  Ooh, real man.  Steve keeps going.  All right, Steve.  You're welcome.  That's good.  Steve's doing a good job.  What's the next move he makes?  Well.  Now that your bra is undone.  Steve's going to push aside the chair because I would have been sitting on a chair during 
[03:11:30]  this time.  Uh-huh.  And he's going to come behind me and he's going to have his package on my butt.  Oh, so now you're standing or is he just.  Yeah.  Okay, you're standing.  Now I'm just, you know.  So you're feeling all of his manhood against your butt.  Yeah.  And you can tell he's turned on.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I've had that happen to me when I'm doing spots in the studio.  Yeah.  Comes up behind.  Let me show you how this is read.  Steve.  It's like he's teaching you to play tennis.  He reaches around and grabs your arm.  Teaches you the latest golf swing. 
[03:12:00]  Is he packing?  Steve's packing.  Ah.  Ooh.  Now I know this is a fantasy.  You feel his turgid pole pressed against your ebony cheeks.  Then what?  Yes.  When does he hit you over the head with a frying pan?  Yeah.  When does he just get angry and you realize he hates women?  Tries to get noises out of you for his next promo.  Yeah.  When does that happen?  When he clumsily fumbles with your buttons and they don't come off?  So he smothers your face into the buttons?  He goes, can you do that again? 
[03:12:30]  The levels were fucked up.  I just hear various audio queuing here and there all willy-nilly as he pushes her face  across the buttons on the console.  He's just screaming, no, it's not an option with his big fingers in your mouth so you can't  holler for help.  The studio is soundproof stupid.  It's like watching a silent film.  I'm flailing.  So now he's behind you, package is against your butt, but you're still clothed, your bra 
[03:13:00]  is unclipped, he's got his hands kind of on your back, but I'm guessing if he's right  against you, now they're starting to venture a little around your hips and your side.  Yep.  He's going to start unbuttoning my pants now.  Now he's going for the unbuckle of the pants.  For the shorts.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Nice, your little shorts.  Yeah.  How short are they?  Very short.  Very short.  Short shorts.  Yeah, short shorts.  We've seen the short shorts.  Short shorts.  Yeah.  Short shorts.  She wears the shortest.  Yeah, so she's got the short shorts on. 
[03:13:30]  Howie from New York City wants in real fast.  Howie!  When does he smell her?  And she smells like fish and then he bites down on her.  The old salmon.  Swimming upstream.  All right, where are we?  Just wants to spawn.  Let's get back into this.  Where are we?  Steve is unbuckling the pants.  Okay.  Yeah.  And what do you do?  I let him unbuckle it.  Now you're not really arguing.  Now, your hands just at your side like a soldier at attention or what are you doing now? 
[03:14:00]  He's close behind you.  Where are your hands?  On the countertop.  On the countertop.  Yeah.  Are you slightly bent over a little bit?  Yeah.  All right.  And he's unbuckling your shorts.  He unbuckles them.  I could just imagine.  But what happens?  Continue.  What's he saying?  He's saying, you have a very lovely ass.  Ooh.  Yeah.  Very nice, Steve.  Can you say that, Steve?  I'd like to hear it.  Come on.  You have a very lovely ass, Francine.  Thank you, Steve.  You're welcome.  That stupid smile.  What a creep. 
[03:14:30]  What a cordial rape this is.  I like to be polite up until this.  Yeah.  He sends out an invite.  Lovely ass.  We don't know when it's going to end.  I'm going to dump bleach on your vagina to cover up any DNA after this.  We have Jimmy Johnson calling in, so we've got to move this along.  We've got about five, six minutes.  Jesus.  So what happens?  So your pants are down?  Mm-hmm.  Now he pulls the pants down.  You're wearing your thong.  Yeah.  Now what happens?  Keep it going.  Keep it rolling now.  Well, Steve's not going to take off the thong, because that would be too easy. 
[03:15:00]  And he's a queer.  He's not a queer.  Of course not.  Look how far he's getting.  Yeah.  Steve got really far.  So your shorts are around your ankles, your thong right there, your beautiful ebony behind  is showing out of the thong, and what happens?  So he'll just slip his fingers through the thong.  Kind of underneath?  Yeah.  A little underneath from behind.  Oh, look at that.  It's getting all excited just talking about it.  Now we're on the front or the back.  Good move, Steve. 
[03:15:30]  From the back.  Oh, he's tickling the bunghole.  Yeah, nice.  All clumsy like Herman Munster.  Grandpa.  Take her into the lab.  You're going to fuck on Herman?  So he's getting you a little aroused that way.  Now let's get to the action here.  How does he actually make the final move?  Well, he'll put it in.  So he unbuckles his own pants, or do you reach around? 
[03:16:00]  What happens?  Yeah.  He'll unbuckle his own pants.  He unbuckles because he feels you're ready to accept?  Yeah.  And what, does he pull the thong aside, or does he rip the thong down?  No, he just leaves it.  You can still have sets of panties on.  Yeah.  I know.  But you've got to kind of, you know, pull it aside a little.  Yeah.  Okay, so he pulls it aside, and then puts it in.  Is he rough, or is he gentle with putting it in?  He's gentle.  He's very gentle.  Of course he is. 
[03:16:30]  Gentle Ben.  Not like that horse in that video with that guy, right?  Yeah.  Feels a little, and then drives it home.  Yeah.  You know, very gentle, and wow, that's some scene.  And he gives you a good ride?  Yeah.  Where does he finish?  Yeah, he can't finish inside you.  Oh, yes, he can.  It's dangerous.  You might get pregnant.  Oh, bring another conglomerated mongrel bear into this world. 
[03:17:00]  Nate in Brooklyn.  Nate.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Yeah, I wanted to know if part of the fantasy is that he gives her oral,  does he get stuck in there and need Tigger and Piglet to help get him out?  Let's take it easy.  I'm trapped in the vagina.  Could you please get me out, Tigger?  You want to bang Steve now?  Or is this fantasy over?  Well, that was back then, you guys.  No, she's moved on.  You're not into him anymore?  I still like Steve, but I...  But he lost too much weight for you.  Yeah.  All right.  Do you want to see him nude with a little red half shirt on? 
[03:17:30]  Sitting under a tree?  That would be nice.  Oh, I thought you were talking to me.  Yes.  All right.  Okay.  That was good.  Grr.  All right.  Can we hear the orgasm you had?  Come on.  I'm filling up.  Guys.  What?  Guys.  What happened?  Like, what would you say?  You'd have to talk to him while he was banging you.  Yeah.  You'd have to say something.  What would you say?  What would you say?  Anything?  What do you mean?  What would I say?  Fuck me, Steve.  Oh, yeah, Steve.  Oh, that part? 
[03:18:00]  Yeah.  That's your something.  Dirty talk or...  Okay, so Steve would be inside me, and he'll get a little rough right before the peak.  Oh.  Yeah, so I'll be like, yeah, Steve, harder.  Mm-hmm.  You're a hack.  You're a sex hack.  I'm not a sex hack.  I don't know, but I'm not too good on the sexy stuff.  Yeah?  You can't, like, fake sexy talk?  Like...  I can fake sexy talk if I'm having sex. 
[03:18:30]  I always fake it.  Isn't that funny?  I could fake die if someone shoots me in the head.  You said you could fake sexy talk if you're having sex.  Yeah, but I'm not having sex right now, so I don't know how to fake it.  That's what we mean, like acting.  Let's go to BCH.  BCH.  Silly, Francine.  Don't you know if you just play dead, he'll lose interest and go away?  That is the rumor.  That's right.  You're supposed to just lay there like you're dead.  He'll sniff you a little.  If Steve pulls over your shorts, just run downhill.  Anthony in New York.  They can't run downhill. 
[03:19:00]  Hey.  Hey, what's going on?  I wanted to know, at what point does Steve get on his back and she goes,  he's such a good bear.  He's such a good bear.  Yeah, from the grizzly man.  You're a good bear.  Randy.  Yo, I heard if Steve wants to go and have a day with her,  she could steal a picnic basket for that first date.  A picnic basket.  All right.  Well, it's a great fantasy.  All right, we've got a break.  Jimmy Johnson.  Going to talk a little NASCAR next.  Goddamn.  A lot of controversy in the NASCAR world. 
[03:19:30]  Ooh.  Ben, do you like my hairdo?  I love it.  Wonderful.  All right, we'll be back with Jimmy Johnson in just a bit.  All right, you're checking out the Opie and Anthony program.  We have a real celebrity on the line for once, Jimmy Johnson. 
[03:20:00]  Hello.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony program.  How are you, sir?  I'm good.  Thanks for having me on.  Everyone's talking about Jimmy Johnson today.  Why?  What happened?  Well, you know, about the little issue, the little problem with your crew chief.  Yeah, well.  There may have been some cheating going on.  That's what they're saying.  What are the allegations here?  Well, NASCAR made a ruling that our car didn't meet a template on the back glass after qualifying. 
[03:20:30]  And, you know, it's all there is to it.  I mean, we're pushing in all the gray areas to get everything that we can.  And, unfortunately, you know, the car didn't pass inspection after qualifying.  And, you know, NASCAR has passed out a punishment that we've got to live with and deal with.  And we're doing everything we can to move on and get ready for the 500 and the race to follow.  And we'll see.  There hasn't been an official ruling.  I'm not exactly sure if there's official on how many days he's going to be gone or how many weekends we're going to miss him for. 
[03:21:00]  But, you know, we're just kind of dealing with things from there.  What could possibly be done to the rear window that could be against their ruling that would help you?  Well, they have so many different templates that lay on the back of the car.  And it's the crew chief's job and the aerodynamicist and everybody that's working on the car.  It's their job to really manipulate those and to get the tolerances, you know, as close as possible  and push those areas to shape the car in a way that it will go faster. 
[03:21:30]  Have they gotten more strict with those over the years?  Yeah, definitely over the years, you know, the tolerances they allow keep getting tighter and tighter.  And we weren't within the rules.  And it is what it is.  It sounds like everyone bends the rules here and there as much as they can, right?  Yeah, I mean, that's the job.  It seems like it would be part of the whole NASCAR thing.  It's the whole game.  And over time, you know, NASCAR, they don't want you to mess with those things.  So they keep making the violation stiffer and stiffer.  And, you know, we've got a huge violation that we're faced with now. 
[03:22:00]  And it looks like maybe four weeks of not having my crew chief at the racetrack.  That's a big penalty.  So...  And do you have audio of you talking to your crew chief behind closed doors?  I want to hear that.  No.  No, I mean, you know, I just get in the car and drive it.  I'm definitely disappointed.  I know that Chad's disappointed and everyone is involved.  But, you know, it's his job to work over the gray areas.  And, you know, something wasn't right and we got in trouble. 
[03:22:30]  Right.  Hey, we got Doug Outdug.  He wants to talk to you, Jimmy.  Doug Outdug, what's up?  What's going on?  Jimmy Johnson, man.  Huge fan of you and the Hendricks team.  Been a big fan of Gordon since day one.  And I've been following your career for quite some time.  Do you think that NASCAR is going a little bit overboard this year with the rules?  Was it the 99 car that tried to avoid an accident at the shootout this weekend?  Was it the 99 car?  You know, I don't know what happened with him.  I saw him, you know, flying by the left side. 
[03:23:00]  I mean, as I was trying to get to pit road, and thankfully he didn't get in the back of me.  You know, he was going like 100 miles an hour faster than I was.  So, from that deal, I don't know enough about it.  I've had my hands full with our situation.  But, you know, the thing that NASCAR is showing with this ruling is some consistency.  If you think back to last year, Todd Barrier had an issue,  and they suspended him for a period of time.  And this looks like it's in line with that.  And that's all the teams can ask for is the rulings to be consistent.  And, you know, I think NASCAR has been fair to the 48 team over the years. 
[03:23:30]  We had some shocks that they didn't think were, you know, were fair for us to have.  They weren't illegal, but they didn't penalize us on those in, I guess, the Dover race last season.  And we had an appeal overturn after winning a case with them,  and they realized that we weren't cheating earlier in the year.  So, you know, I feel that they've taken care of, you know,  that they've looked at everything with an open mind.  And it's been, you know, it's been good, and this is bad.  It seems like NASCAR is getting too complicated.  I say let you guys use whatever you want. 
[03:24:00]  Like the old days.  Yeah, what's that?  Just get the stock car out there.  Man, there's just way too much.  Yeah, invested, right?  So, Jimmy, who steps in and takes the place to Chad Knauss now that he's out of the picture of this?  Very good question, Doug.  Well, we have our race engineer that's been up on the box and has been with the 48 team since the beginning.  His name's Darian Grubb, and he's going to step in and take over that responsibility.  And he's going to do all right.  Now, the Daytona...  But he's going to do a great job.  It's a chance for all of us on the team to step up and, you know, really do our jobs. 
[03:24:30]  Hey, Jimmy, the Daytona 500's going to be, what, on the 50-year anniversary of Dale's death?  Yes.  How does that weigh on the driver's minds?  I mean, that's got to be going through your head.  You know, I feel...  Very good question, Anthony.  Thank you.  I feel that climbing in a race car, I know the risks that I take, and I'm fully aware of that and want to be in a race car doing my job.  On top of that, I also know that the safety has improved so much since Dale's death  that I feel... 
[03:25:00]  I felt safe then, and I feel even safer now, and I think we've been able to back that up with some data  and show, you know, impacts that were much harder than Dale's, and have drivers walk away from them.  So I feel like I'm in a very safe race car.  You know what I like about Jimmy Johnson?  He got fined for cursing on TV.  How much did he get fined for that?  Me?  Yeah.  No, it wasn't me.  I think that was Junior who...  Yeah, that was that nice gesture on TV.  I think he said hell or damn or something like that when he was doing his interview post-race.  And they got him a fine for saying hell or damn? 
[03:25:30]  Yeah, $30,000.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  They took some championship points away from him, too, so they don't...  Yeah.  They don't stick lightly to it.  This question on the list should be on tomorrow's sheet.  That's still...  Jimmy, what are you guys feeding Kyle Busch over there, man?  That man was...  He was on a rampage at the shootout.  But, man, I agree.  I had my fair share of fun with him as well.  So he was definitely jacked up for a sprint race. 
[03:26:00]  All right.  You got anybody that's your kind of a nemesis or a rival?  Duke it out with on the track?  Maybe trade a little paint with?  You know, this year we're off to a clean start.  Give me a few weeks and we may have some start up.  But, you know, right now it's New Year.  I didn't have anything to carry over from last season, so I'm in good shape.  I just like the old days with the Earnhardt-Waltrip kind of battle that used to go on.  That was always fun to watch. 
[03:26:30]  Yeah.  We'll all be out there beating up on each other.  I'm sure through the duels there'll be something that pops up for us all to talk about.  And, you know, it'll stay exciting, to say the least.  Has any driver's ever threatened you and said,  Hey, we're going to put on the gloves and go into an octagon?  No, I think that's a great idea.  I mean, we could even get the fans involved and have a stage that's, you know,  You know, by the start-finish line.  Charity event, you know.  Are you surprised with how big, like, on Threlavision, like, this has gotten?  I mean, it's amazing the viewers that NASCAR gets.  I have loyal, loyal fans that really support our racing events. 
[03:27:00]  It doesn't matter if it's truck, bushel, cup level.  You know, they're vocal.  They're into the sport.  You know, they can be your best friend at certain times and be your enemy at other times.  It just depends on what's all shaking down.  Sure.  It's an amazing sport.  And I think it's really surprising a lot of people how big it is.  I'm happy to see it.  I've been a part of it my whole life.  And I've been very proud of our sport.  And I'm glad to see the rest of the country taking on with it.  Yeah, it's blowing up.  You just got to get in the car and kind of shake it up.  Shake it up, right?  Yeah, just get out there and do my job, man. 
[03:27:30]  Rage hard and chase that checkered flag.  All right, Doug, thank you.  Let's go to Mike in Arizona.  Mike, what's up?  Hey, Jimmy Johnson.  Super big fan.  I got a question.  Two years ago, you were on fire, and you probably would have won the cup by an ungodly amount.  What do you think of that final ten races?  I think that took your glory away from you two years ago.  You came back and finished second.  You would have smoked everybody.  That's a really good question, Mike.  He's like, thanks for reminding me, Jeff.  Yeah, yeah.  No, I appreciate it. 
[03:28:00]  I don't know.  I guess the year before the chase started, I would have won the chase with chase format.  The year after, I would have been second still, regardless of the way things were going to shake out.  But I'm in favor for it.  I think it's taken our sport to a new level.  It's gotten more fans involved.  It relates to the other ball games.  As a whole, I think it's grown our sport, and that's all that I'm really concerned about.  I wasn't in favor of it when it started, but like I said, if it's grown our sport, that's an important thing.  Every other sport seems to be struggling at different times, and ours has done nothing but grow. 
[03:28:30]  What do you think of that young driver out of Florida, E-Rock?  What do you think of him?  He's supposed to be tearing it up.  You know, I haven't heard a word about him.  Fill me in.  I don't know much about him.  I just heard his name.  He was a big wrestling fan and a good racer.  There's not too much info on him.  Yeah.  Well, let's go to Brad in South Carolina.  Brad?  Hey, Jimmy.  Big honor to talk to you, sir.  Thanks, man.  Thank you for pushing my driver to a victory on Sunday.  And I just wanted to get your take on bump drafting.  I know a lot of people seem real scared these days about it. 
[03:29:00]  Yeah, that's a great question, Brad.  Yeah.  You know, I'm going to steal Brian Vickers' quote here.  Brian and I had a long conversation the other day.  But think about the bump drafting.  It has caused a few accidents, but more of the side-to-side door slamming causes the wrecks  in anything or drivers trying to squeeze into holes that aren't there.  Yeah.  So, you know, the bump drafting, I'm not sure how they're going to correct it.  I think that if they do soften up the front bumpers on the cars, that would be a great  step in the right direction.  The thing I'm afraid of is now giving NASCAR an opportunity to make a judgment call. 
[03:29:30]  There's a lot more that goes on in the draft than what you see with that bump that takes  place.  There's a lot of pushing and shoving going on before that.  So, I don't want a judgment call out there on the track.  Hopefully, they make a change to the cars and then let us race.  Jimmy, we're running out of time on our show.  So, what are you thinking?  I'm thinking, you know, we're starting at the back of the duel.  We've got to win that.  I'm going to get in the 500 and win that.  And then also, I want to plug my show that's playing at 7 p.m. Thursday night.  Yeah, we've got the NASCAR channel, XM channel 144. 
[03:30:00]  You're on from 7 to 7.30 Eastern time.  Exactly.  Our first show's coming up.  That's a tough show, a half hour.  I want that contract.  I spend hours in a car.  Jimmy, we're running out of time.  Thank you so much for calling the show.  And good luck this weekend.  Good luck, man.  You got it.  Thank you.  Program complete. </pre>
