<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast featured a central stunt: the "55-gallon drum challenge."  Five women – Christy, Wendy, Kate, Jane, and Tabitha – were recruited to participate.  Before the challenge began, the hosts, Opie and Anthony, along with several studio assistants including "Psycho Mark" and Rick, prepared five 55-gallon drums (four standard, one oversized).  The women were interviewed and their attire described in detail before being placed inside the sealed drums.  Listener Pete Marchados donated $1000, and the women received a $1000 Shrewsbury Bicycles gift certificate.  A caller, Ken, offered placenta, which was declined.  Listeners were encouraged to contribute items, resulting in the acquisition of three five-gallon buckets of "chum" and other materials.  Air holes were drilled into the drums, and the initial substances poured in were beer and water.

The challenge itself involved pouring a progressively disgusting array of substances into the barrels.  This included beer, water, Sobe, cat litter, raw eggs, corn oil, lotion, V8 juice, Worcestershire sauce, Aunt Jemima syrup, a large quantity of live and dead fish (including a squid, sardines, and a larger fish with its guts and eyeballs), and "clam chum" (a mixture of ground corn, fish guts, and other unspecified ingredients).  Christy's barrel broke, spilling its contents.  The increasingly foul smell caused studio crew member Rick to become violently ill.  Andrew Dice Clay made a brief call.  The show aired commercials for Paisano's restaurant, the Razor Rollerboard Scooter from Sharper Image, and Mouchon hair removal wax.  A New Rochelle Toyota dealership representative called to describe the crowd's reaction to the broadcast at their location. Callers offered suggestions and reactions, with one mentioning the potential for maggots.  Further substances added included chocolate syrup, dog food, anchovies, prune juice, sardines, and live mealworms or similar insects.

The challenge continued with crickets, wax worms, mealworms, and finally, large hissing cockroaches. Kate and Christy exited first due to discomfort, increasing the prize money for the remaining contestants – Wendy, Jane, and Tabitha – who ultimately shared the winnings.  Joey Paisano offered $1000 in gift certificates to his restaurant, split among the participants.  The women expressed varying levels of distress and disgust, with reactions ranging from screaming and visible discomfort to giggling and numb acceptance.  The hosts highlighted the sound bites and seemed to enjoy the women’s reactions.  Callers included Tyrell (thanking the show for a van at an event) and "Gorilla Boy" (sharing a humorous encounter with fans).  The show concluded with the women offering brief comments, plugs, and thanks to listeners.  Jeff Norris, a staff member who also participated, returned to the studio.  The show’s website, WNAW.com (or possibly dw.com), was promoted, featuring 170 pictures from the event.  The hosts ended with further humorous remarks.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Chill out, you bastards. We're here.  Abuse on the instant feedback.  We're here. We want to just jam another song. We'll start the festivities.  It's Friday. It's June 16th. We are live, just like we told you yesterday.  Ponderous.  We told you we'd be here starting at 2.  2?  We want to start with a couple songs. Relax.  Relax, you mother effers.  The abuse we're getting on the instant feedback, Anthony.  Start your show. You said 2. F-ing Ponderous.  I guess starting at 2 means jamming a Metallica song, you whack bags. 
[00:00:30]  What's wrong with that?  I'm just reading. Every instant feedback is abuse.  Let's punish them and play another one.  Effers.  1027 WNEW. It's the ONA Show. We're here. We'll be back. Relax.  All right, here he comes.  Anthony is evil, but Opie is worse than Hitler.  We're off to a flying start here on the Opie and Cruel Any Human Show.  1027 WNEW.  All right, mark your calendar. This is a first for the ONA Show. 
[00:01:00]  Yeah.  Actually being live in the 2 o'clock hour.  Yeah, look at that.  Just to prove it, it's June 16th, 2002.  Two!  On this FU Friday.  Of course, we're getting ready for the 55-gallon drum challenge, Anthony.  Yes, our little serial killer segment.  I got to use a line that the radio chick gave me down the hall.  Yeah.  She comes running down, she goes, guys, it looks like Joel Rifkin's basement down near the studio.  Well, you can hear drilling going on. 
[00:01:30]  Drilling and hammering, and there's all kinds of sounds going on that don't sound very nice.  We met the ladies for a moment.  Yeah, we shouldn't have met them, because now I feel guilty.  Yeah, they all seem really nice and everything.  We got some lovely ladies in this concert.  Yeah, now we're going to torture them.  Yeah.  Maybe if we just refer to them as it, we won't think of them as people.  It gets in the barrel. 
[00:02:00]  It gets in the barrel, or it gets those again.  We got some great contestants, Anthony.  One of them weighs 250 pounds.  I met her, and I went, whoa!  We had to get a special barrel for her.  Yeah, I see that.  One of these things is not like the other going on.  No.  One of the barrels is just a little wider than the rest.  Yeah.  It seems that our big girl is truly a big girl.  Wait, drill on the air, just to give some sound.  It's hilarious.  I need to take a look over there. 
[00:02:30]  Listen to the drill.  They're putting the air holes in the 55-gallon drums.  Keep them up a little high.  Yeah, there they go.  It's like a job site in here.  Get me my Sawzall.  All right.  Very good.  Where'd you get the hole saw in the drill and stuff?  Pete's got all that stuff.  He needs that to clean the coffee machine.  Amazing.  Oh, that mic's not even on.  That's why we couldn't really hear it. 
[00:03:00]  I think you've got to use one of the handhelds.  And we have the lids to all these things and everything?  Yeah.  Why don't we put the girls in first and then drill the holes in the side?  Check this out.  Oh, yeah.  With the metal strap around.  Oh, my God, dude.  Look, it's got a locking metal strap.  Yeah.  Clips right into position.  The drum guy just brought these in.  They are going to be everywhere.  There we go. 
[00:03:30]  Now we're thrilling.  Oh, this is sick.  Are all the girls going to empty their bladders or something?  Yeah, they're all going to the bathroom right now.  Yeah.  Yeah, they're getting into their bra and panties, Anthony.  Nice.  We're taking a ton of pictures for the event.  We've got to thank Scott Colombo.  He's working his ass off.  We should have our first pictures up on WNAW.com of the contestants, Anthony. 
[00:04:00]  Yeah.  They're going to look a lot different when 7 o'clock rolls around.  It's going to be a very, very long show for them.  They're all nice and cute and pretty and all dressed up.  Yeah, I'm very surprised at the girls that turned out for this.  Because they are.  They're like attractive girls.  Everyone's screaming, get the girls in the drum now. 
[00:04:30]  Larry, what's going on?  Larry.  Hey, man.  Larry.  Whatever, you.  Whatever your name is.  It's Riley.  What's going on, guys?  Hey, Riley.  Hey, first time caller here.  Love the show.  Got to tell you that.  Thank you.  What's up with this procrastination?  We've got to get those girls in the drum.  Well, we're past 2 o'clock.  We're just about there.  We're just about there.  They'll be in by 2.30.  That's fine.  That's close enough.  Damn.  As you can tell, they're still preparing the drums in the background.  Hey, any hints of what you guys are going to throw in? 
[00:05:00]  The secret sauce or the secret whatever it was?  Larry.  We are encouraging listeners to come down to the station with stuff to throw into the drum.  We have to decide if your stuff is safe enough to put in the drum.  Yeah.  And there's already a line upstairs to come on down and put stuff in the drum.  Hey, Papa.  You don't have that.  All right.  I can tell you this.  We have...  We left milk out for the last eight hours.  On a radiator.  Oh. 
[00:05:30]  Oh.  And I hear...  That's just gross.  I hear the chum has arrived, huh?  The chum is here.  Three buckets.  Oh, guys.  You've got to take care.  All right, Riley.  Looking forward to it.  All right.  Second mark.  There's three buckets of chum.  Three five-gallon buckets of chum.  Oh, my God.  No.  Oh, no.  Not to mention all the stuff we purchased last night.  Oh, no.  Did you see all the stuff they purchased?  Yeah.  I don't want to give it away.  I'll just tell you.  It fills up a shopping cart.  We've got some great stuff.  And it doesn't count what the listeners bring down today. 
[00:06:00]  No.  A lot of construction going on around the building.  Yes.  I'm assuming, like, I don't know, sawdust.  And all sorts of fun stuff.  Are we just about done with the drilling?  A couple more.  A couple more?  All right.  A couple more holes.  See, they made the holes in the lids.  Now they're making a couple in the sides, I guess, so the air can circulate through.  Hey, Ken, what's going on?  Hey, listen.  I have the best stuff for you.  Yeah.  I work at a place called the Family Birthing Center in East Meadow.  I want to bring down placenta. 
[00:06:30]  Oh, my God.  I'm dead serious.  We normally send it out to drug companies because they do testing.  We can't have any biohazard material being dumped on us.  Yeah.  We know they use that stuff in, like, makeup and shampoos.  Yeah, but I think it's taken care of by that point.  We might have to pass on that.  We don't need any biohazard material.  Because we got, like, four of them here.  Dude.  Oh.  Yeah.  Not to cut this guy off, but thank you, Ken.  All right.  You see what they're doing for the big girl?  Yeah, I know.  They have two, two of those big green pails that you see the landscapers used for the grass clippings. 
[00:07:00]  Yeah.  In the back, they're going to put them on top of each other so she is encapsulated in two of these garbage pails.  I believe that's the delay right now, Anthony.  Yeah.  You know?  Usually, you find nothing more than an El Salvadorian inside these pails in the back of the pickup trucks during a landscaping season.  But you need two of them put on top of each other.  You know, I learned something today.  What? 
[00:07:30]  You know, you never see, like, you know, fat victims of serial killers.  No.  Too much work.  That's true.  Too much work.  I mean, what serial killer is going to go through all the trouble that we are to get a big girl in one of these drugs?  I know.  We have big enough holes to dump this stuff in?  Yeah.  How are we going to dump this stuff in?  We have big enough holes?  Yeah.  Okay.  Very good.  All right.  Do you want to talk to some of the ladies, Anthony?  Yeah, we might as well.  All right.  Get to know them a little better before they're imprisoned and their drums full of crap. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah, let's get a couple of the girls in here.  I want to talk to a couple of the ladies.  Get a couple of the ladies while they continue.  Huh?  A couple of girls.  Yeah, we'll get a couple of girls in here and we'll talk to them.  Jesus, Michael.  All right.  Mark, keep drilling them holes.  All right.  Let's get the ladies in.  Get them on that mic over there, Ben.  That'll be the easiest way. 
[00:08:30]  Get ready for some torture.  Holy cow.  Wow.  What have you got on there?  Well, let's see.  Well, we're going for one piece.  We didn't want everything hanging out today.  Okay.  Now, what's your name?  Christy.  Hi, Christy.  You're the reason we're building a special drum.  That's right.  It's a special serial killer drum just for you.  I've been bothering you almost every day for that.  I see.  She's very excited to get on the drum.  It scares me. 
[00:09:00]  There's no problem with her fitting in this thing.  No, at all.  This thing is gigantic.  And you're wearing a one piece.  What is that?  Like a bustier?  It's a bustier kind of thing.  Scuba suit.  Scuba suit.  Scuba suit.  Scuba suit.  Scuba suit.  Ponderous.  All right.  Okay.  Very nice.  And you're ready for this?  You think you're going to go the distance?  Definitely.  Definitely.  Definitely.  You weigh what?  250?  Yes.  250?  250.  250.  You got huge boobs, too, man. 
[00:09:30]  48 triple D.  48 triple D, Opie.  Do you wow at those things?  Wow.  Whoa.  I guess she does.  There's one word for that.  Wow.  Oh, my goodness.  Catch her to lose it, babe.  Catch her to lose it.  Those are gigantic.  I got to say.  Yeah.  All right.  Okay.  So she's got the bustier thing.  I think you're into, like, S&M and stuff, too.  Is she happy with her large boobs?  Not me.  No?  Oh, you are, huh?  Oh, no, no.  No. 
[00:10:00]  I had her confused with someone else.  She says no.  It means yes.  Okay.  Great.  So you're looking forward to getting into the barrels and being covered with all kinds  of crap.  And www.com is getting hounded.  Yeah.  I'm trying to find where we're putting the pictures today.  Let me see.  I think it might be under Semi.  No.  Ask Colombo where the listeners need to go to see the pictures.  We're taking pictures as we go so you guys can play along at home.  Uh, you're not claustrophobic at all?  Not at all. 
[00:10:30]  No.  Okay.  And I haven't met the rest of the ladies, but my money's on, uh, Christy.  She's going to go the distance.  Yeah.  I've got to believe it.  There's no doubt in my mind she's going the distance.  What do you got there?  I'll give you this to play with for a little while.  What the hell is that?  I'll give you the back.  What is that?  I've never seen.  That's like a balloon launcher.  Wow.  It's a bra.  That's a bra.  Dude, it's huge.  It's huge.  Wow.  Look at this girl.  I've never seen midgets.  That's a balloon launcher.  Very nice, Christy.  Very nice.  Well, you all got, like, little...  What is that you're wearing?  What's your name? 
[00:11:00]  Wendy.  Wendy.  Where's Wendy?  Very good.  You almost slipped.  Okay, Wendy.  Wait, tell Wendy to stand up.  I can't see her.  Look, she's got a little...  Oh, I remember you.  It looks like a pajama party or something.  That's very cute.  So, what are you wearing?  A little baby doll dress.  A little baby doll dress.  Very cute.  You're going to get into...  I don't know if I'm off, but...  Oh, yeah.  I was going to say, you're not going to get into the barrel and ruin it or something.  No.  They have to be in their brown pants.  She's taking off the baby dress in the water.  Very nice.  What do you think your chances are of making it through this?  Well, I think I'm going to do it. 
[00:11:30]  Yeah?  You're going to do it?  Yeah.  I have the height advantage because I'm not cramped up.  Oh.  So, and I go.  Not claustrophobic.  Not claustrophobic.  That's good.  Because the barrel, the lid will be slapped on and the metal band will be put around and you will  be entrapped in there for, you know, about four and a half hours.  Four and a half hours.  Now, can we put the names of the girls on their barrel?  Yeah.  Yeah, we have to do that.  Because each barrel is going to be mic'd and we're not going to know what we're talking  to.  We're going to be able to hear the show when we're in there, right?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:12:00]  Here, you're the show today.  Yeah.  You think we can plan anything else today?  There you go.  I'm going to go a little faster.  All right.  Now, we got a...  What's your name?  Tabitha.  Look at her with the little Heidi hair doing.  They're all so freaking hot.  I feel guilty now.  Now, you're...  What are you wearing under that robe?  She's got, like, Victoria's Secret.  I know.  She's got...  Let's take this off now.  Well, just open it up.  Let's take a little look.  Holy smoke.  My Lord.  Look at what she's wearing.  You just come from a lingerie show or something? 
[00:12:30]  Look at that.  That's my job, actually.  No.  Wow.  Look at her.  I doubt it.  Not bad.  Very nice.  Very nice.  All right.  And do you think your chances are very good?  Excellent.  Yeah?  Not claustrophobic?  You could take being cramped up in there?  Not at all.  You don't have a weak bladder?  Not at all.  No?  All right.  Okay.  Wow.  They're very confident.  Yes.  And you, what is your name?  Jane.  Jane.  What are you wearing in the barrel?  Just a normal cloth.  She's got brawn panties.  She's got a towel around her for the time being. 
[00:13:00]  Bandana on her head.  Very smart, so her hair won't get all goopy.  Everyone's...  There's a bunch of perverts that are looking at you guys through that studio window.  Yeah.  So you can wave to them, because you can't see them?  Whoa.  They just got wowed.  Very nice.  Dolly.  Dolly.  That damn wow thing never gets old, doesn't it?  I know.  You've got to love it.  All right.  And who haven't we talked to?  Jane.  Jane.  Hi, Jane.  How are you?  How are you?  She's Jane.  Oh, and then...  We were just talking to Jane.  I'm sorry.  I've got to get all the names down here.  Kate? 
[00:13:30]  Kate seems a little shy, a little quiet.  A little shy, a little quiet.  That's okay.  What do you think?  And she's like fully dressed at this point.  I am.  Well, when I get in the barrel, I can just slip her right off.  Oh, okay.  I got it.  That's fine.  As long as...  I just want to know what the strategies are here.  Oh, yeah.  No, no.  I got it down.  You guys realize what you're in for, right?  Yeah.  Really?  Not really?  No.  She is a little...  I think we have...  This is the person that I'm...  I got my odds on as the first one out.  Do you think...  Let me...  Do you think you're going to make it through the whole thing? 
[00:14:00]  I think so.  All right.  I'm going to...  Not quite as confident.  I'm going to...  I'm going to...  I'm going to guess she's out first, Kate.  No.  No, no, no.  All right.  Now I'm definitely saying it.  Christy goes the distance.  I think...  I think four out of the five go the distance today.  Yeah.  Could look that way.  You're leaving me out?  That's horrible.  Just on the first impression.  Just on the first impression.  These will change by the minute.  Yeah.  You can change our opinion.  And as the show goes, all right here today.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Don't you worry.  All right.  Do you guys realize we have $2,500 cash up for grabs? 
[00:14:30]  Someone could walk away with $2,500 today.  Or it gets divvied up between whoever's left at the end.  Correct.  So...  You definitely...  You all get a certificate to Shrewsbury Bicycle for $1,000, right?  That's guaranteed.  That's a $1,000 bike.  That's guaranteed.  And other stuff that we have later on, concert tickets and blah, blah, blah.  So, I would think if one of you girls would be so inclined to psych out the other ones while  you're in the barrel, you know, like the guy's in prison and stuff and there's the new fish 
[00:15:00]  next to him and he tries to get him to break down and cry.  Yeah.  Like, you might want to try that to get the other girl to leave, you know.  Maybe talk about how horrible the stuff is and where it's seeping into in your body.  Just little ideas, you know.  Maybe if you want to get the... walk away with all the cash.  We've been working on that already.  Have you?  Yeah.  Very good.  We've been buying them with drinks out there so the bathroom problem...  Oh, that's good.  See?  Look at that.  Smart girl there.  Very good.  The before and after shots are going to be hilarious. 
[00:15:30]  Yeah.  Because they're all very nice looking.  They're all very attractive girls.  I was so surprised when I saw you girls walk in here and it's like, what is this?  I thought we were going to get some homeless girls down here, but no.  Very attractive, willing to go the distance.  Do we have any of the pictures up yet?  Not yet.  Scott's loading up the pictures and the names.  We've got the guys who brought some of the stuff down.  We've got Captain Anthony who brought the chum.  Arr!  Captain Anthony, arr!  How you doing, man?  Good.  You brought chum? 
[00:16:00]  Brought chum and a special surprise.  Now, what is in chum?  No, no, no.  Yeah, don't even say it.  Okay.  Oh, okay.  I can give you an idea.  We can put them in the soundproof room or something.  Most people have watched Jaws, so they kind of know what chum is all about.  The stuff they ladle out into the water.  Into the water to attract the fish.  And it's fresh.  Okay.  Nothing rotten.  All right.  Nothing unedible.  Well, that's it.  Because, you know...  It's organic.  Absolutely.  All right.  It dissolves with water.  Thank you, Captain Anthony.  Arr!  Arr!  Arr!  Arr!  Arr!  All right. 
[00:16:30]  All right.  We've got Sal, the drum guy.  Who brought the drums?  Yeah, I brought the drums.  My own private collection.  My own private collection.  From my garage.  In a blank panel van.  Ah.  I've got to keep a low profile.  Yeah, when I drive it out to my shallow graves upstate.  I don't want anybody...  Very good.  The drums are working out well.  You girls are looking at the drums.  None of you have a problem with fitting into them or anything?  No.  No.  And, of course, we've got the industrial size drums.  For Christy.  For Christy.  Too fitty. 
[00:17:00]  Too fitty.  All right.  We've got to take a break, Ant.  And the cricket guys.  We're the cricket guys.  Right there.  Hey, what's up, man?  How's it going?  Good.  Good.  Very good.  Thanks for helping us out today.  We've got two large green coats full of all sorts of insects, man.  Now I've seen a few.  It looks at some of the girls' faces.  I said...  You know something?  It may not even get to that.  Don't you worry.  When I called in the first time, Anthony, you said, no bugs and no snakes.  I said, let's not even talk about the bugs. 
[00:17:30]  It probably won't get to that.  All right.  So it's like that.  I understand.  Don't worry about the bugs because it probably will not get to that.  You never know.  Don't worry.  You're going to do it towards the end.  Yeah.  Don't worry.  Yeah.  That's like a grand finale.  I might get lonely in there.  That's a grand finale if it's like 640 and we've got all five girls still in the barrel.  Has anyone been eating beans and broccoli or anything?  Psycho Mark?  Do you think you could...  Are you ready to charge up?  I'm a Mexican for lunch.  All right.  Hey, let's take a break. 
[00:18:00]  Okay.  When we get back, the girls go into the drums.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  Very good.  We got all the pictures of the ladies, the before shots and stuff.  Yeah, we got the before pictures.  We're going to take the pictures just before we close the lid.  Did we get all individual shots of the girls that are going to be put up and stuff?  Good.  Yeah, because we really want to show what they look like.  And a lot of these pictures will be on www.com.  Yeah.  So, I mean, the site's getting pounded right now.  Oh, my God.  All right, man. 
[00:18:30]  We'll start the festivities next.  Stay there.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Oh, stupid.  Wow.  B-b-boo.  More stupidity on the way.  Ah, rah, rah, rah, rah, rah.  1-2-7-WNEW.  Ah, yes, Anthony, we're back.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7 is our phone number.  We're getting ready for the 55-gallon drum challenge. 
[00:19:00]  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  I am so excited today.  Anthony, before we move on with the festivities, explain the 55-gallon drum challenge real fast to anyone that's just tuning in for the first time today.  Opie, we have, let me see.  We have five barrels.  I don't even know how many barrels we got.  We have five big, like, 55-gallon drum type of barrels.  We have four that look the same, and then one that's just, one is two of those big green garbage barrels you see on the back of the landscaper's trucks full of grass clippings. 
[00:19:30]  Yeah.  Two of those that will have to be turned one on top of another to make a huge capsule to hold the biggest of our girls.  There's Christy, I believe.  Christy, who's the odds-on favorite at this moment.  Yes.  Who is saying she is 250 pounds.  A lot of instant feedback coming in after the people saw the pictures saying closer to three and a quad.  Three and a quad?  That's what a lot of the listeners are saying looking at the pictures.  But regardless, she will indeed fit in this barrel.  But if you weighed three and a quad, why would you, like, fake your weight and say 250? 
[00:20:00]  I mean, well, you know, I don't know.  Might as well just go for the gusto.  And then the other four barrels are your standard 55-gallon drum type barrels with a snap-on lid that cannot be open from the inside.  Right.  We've drilled some air holes in them out of the kindness of our hearts.  And in just a couple of minutes, the girls will get into these barrels.  We will seal them in so they cannot escape.  And throughout the course of this show, until 7 o'clock, we will dump some of the most heinous material known to man into these barrels on top of these girls. 
[00:20:30]  And they will have to stay in these barrels.  If they indeed concede defeat and have to be taken out of the barrel, they lose their chance at $2,500.  $2,500.  Cold, hard cash.  Now, if there's one survivor at the end of the show, they walk away with $2,500.  Right.  If there's two, they split it.  If there's all four of them last.  Five, five, five.  Five, excuse me. 
[00:21:00]  I'm looking at the normal barrels and the huge barrel.  They must divvy it up five ways.  Five ways.  All the ladies will get a gift certificate to Shrewsbury Bicycles.  $1,000 gift certificate for each lady for just going in the barrel.  Yeah.  All right.  Very cool.  That is a very cool prize.  I want to thank Shrewsbury Bicycle for coming forward.  I think the only sponsor that came forward for this bid, I don't understand why.  I thought this was just a tame little radio bid.  Christy's pissed that Joey Paisano didn't come through with some food. 
[00:21:30]  Looks like.  But, like I said earlier, very surprised lovely ladies coming down here for this event.  Yeah.  We're going to...  They're in little baby doll dresses and some lingerie.  Some lingerie.  Yeah.  It's just...  Psycho Mark getting in the barrel.  Do you fit, Psycho Mark?  No.  No.  No.  We can't fit in these barrels.  Psycho Mark.  Oh, Psycho Mark will fit.  Wow.  Oh, that's going to be painful.  That's going to be painful.  Come on.  How the hell are we going to do this?  There's no way.  Hey, I don't think any of the girls could last five hours, Ant. 
[00:22:00]  I don't know.  Not even five.  We're working on four already.  Yeah.  Well, that's okay.  Why don't we get the festivities going?  By the way, I want to thank Scott Colombo.  He's down the hall.  We are snapping pictures as fast as we can.  We're running them down the hall.  And you can check out what we're calling the semi-live studio cam today.  And you can...  Still pics of the event.  Yeah.  Updated as things happen.  As things happen.  So keep checking back.  It's WNW.com.  Just go to Opie and Anthony.  You'll know where to go from there.  Okay?  Now, all their names are being stuck to the respective barrels. 
[00:22:30]  Yeah.  All the barrels have been named.  Oh, my God.  It's like...  You ever go into a warehouse and you see, like, barrels labeled sodium chloride and whatnot?  They're just lined up.  They're just lined up.  Barrels.  Jane.  Kate.  Wendy.  Christy.  Tabitha.  And then we've got the holes in the top of the barrel.  Is that what we'll be dumping the stuff through?  You guys, this is...  Yeah.  This is twisted.  All right.  Very good.  And we've assigned the girls a safe... 
[00:23:00]  Like a safe word.  Like...  A risk thing.  Which is basically, please get me the F out of here.  So that's the safe code word.  Please get me the F out of here.  Okay.  Well, let's parade the girls in.  All right.  Let's get them in the barrels.  Who's first?  Contestant number one.  And that would be Christy.  Christy.  Christy.  Come on in.  Contestant number one.  Here she is.  Two-fitty.  Two-fitty.  Two-fitty.  And I'm in.  Two-fitty.  Wait, wait.  Give her the mic.  Give her the mic.  How are we sealing her barrel since it's two barrels together? 
[00:23:30]  Do we have duct tape?  We've got duct tape, yeah.  Duct tape.  Ooh.  Duct tape.  No serial killer segment is complete without use of duct tape.  God, you've got to love duct tape.  All right.  Christy, we're giving you the option.  You could wow the radio audience if you like.  If you don't want that on the web, that's okay.  I think I'm going to pass on the web.  All right.  Oh, okay.  That's okay.  But Rick's got a picture of her in her one-piece thing.  I don't know what you call it. 
[00:24:00]  It's a bustier.  A bustier.  Scoob-a-suit.  A bustier.  That's boosted.  All right.  A bustier.  Very nice, Christy.  All right.  She is getting in.  The top barrel is now being placed on top of the other one, Opie.  Yeah.  Thus entombing Christy in this landscaper's nightmare.  Wait, wait.  Is there enough air holes in there?  Okay.  There are.  Sure.  All right.  It looks like it had just one little air hole in there.  If they don't talk for like 10 minutes, we'll know they passed out from...  Oh, my God. 
[00:24:30]  She's having a tough time.  All right.  Wait.  She's in.  Any final words?  Bye.  See you in a couple hours.  There she goes.  The top being put on.  And...  Oh, my God.  Spin it around so there's a hole in the front so we can see her.  All right.  Because all of the girls, we should be able to get a little look at them.  A little look.  We kind of have a hole we can peek in.  And the inimitable sound of duct tape.  Yes.  Being ripped.  All right.  Rick, why don't we do this so we can move this along? 
[00:25:00]  Have someone else do the duct taping.  And you can bring the ladies in one by one, okay?  Next lady.  Because all the ladies should be in at the same time or are pretty close to that.  Who's next?  Who is next indeed?  All right.  Contestant number two, Wendy.  Wendy.  Wow.  Lovely Wendy.  Wait.  Wendy has a nice baby doll outfit on.  Baby doll dress on.  Looking very...  Thank you.  Very cute in her little baby doll dress.  Thank you.  It's all pink.  She's the one making me feel very guilty about this.  Little baby doll dress, Anthony. 
[00:25:30]  Sorry.  All right.  She's taking the baby doll dress off to get in the barrel.  Coming after in here.  Okay.  What is she wearing?  Boxer shorts?  All right.  She's got little boxers and a little pink bra.  Very nice.  Wow.  That's cute.  I think I'm going to...  Yeah.  I'm going to have to.  Boxers are coming off.  Boxers are coming off.  You hear the duct tape in the back, girl?  Well, there we go.  She's got a nice little blue and pink panties on.  Yep.  Wonderful.  All right.  We got a stepladder.  Ready?  Yep.  A little stepladder.  She's got to use a little stepladder to get into a barrel. 
[00:26:00]  All right.  Rick, make sure you get a picture for the Internet.  They're helping her in.  Yeah.  You're going to have to help her.  Oh, my God.  Okay.  Her leg is up over the rim.  All right.  Okay.  All right.  Wait.  Get a picture of her standing in her barrel.  Yeah.  All the girls need pictures of them standing in the barrel.  And an up...  God, no wonder she looked a lot taller.  Look at those shoes.  Hi.  You're a little...  You're a little girl.  I'm only 4'10.  You're 4'10.  Well, that'll be easier for you to fit in that barrel.  4'10, what a drastic difference between you and Christy.  Christy is officially entombed, Anthony. 
[00:26:30]  Yeah.  Christy is pretty much entombed in her...  All right.  Wait.  Let's get the top one.  Can we get a picture of her?  Yep.  All right.  We got a picture of Wendy in her barrel?  All right.  Let's...  Let's...  Christy, don't move around too much.  That thing tips over.  I don't know what's going to happen.  It could be...  All right.  Yeah.  We're ready to go.  Okay.  Any final words, Wendy?  I will survive.  Ah.  Very nice.  All right.  There she goes.  She's too cute for this, Anthony.  She is.  This is insane. 
[00:27:00]  She's in the barrel.  All right.  They're taking a couple of picks.  The lid being slapped on now.  And locked on.  I mean, it's like a Houdini lock and everything.  Oh, there it is.  It is latched, closed.  Oh, my God.  This is so...  This is twisted.  Wendy is now officially entombed in the barrel.  All right.  Ben.  Ben.  I want to say hi to Christy.  I want to hear how she sounds in her barrel.  Stick that microphone through the hole there. 
[00:27:30]  How are you doing, Christy?  I feel good.  Just do not throw me over...  No, we wouldn't do that.  No, no.  Not over Niagara Falls, okay?  All right.  You hear the echo in the barrel, Ed?  That's a lot.  I hear it.  All right.  Put the mic through the hole for Wendy.  How is Wendy feeling?  Wendy?  Hi.  Sounds like baby Jessica stuck in the well.  Ed, she says it's really loud in there, so don't bang on the top.  Yeah, don't bang on the top.  It's really loud.  Is it really loud? 
[00:28:00]  All right.  I have enough room, so it's good.  Oh, you feel comfy, though?  Yeah.  You think you'll be able to stay in there now for...  I think I can.  After I'm playing...  For the remainder of the show?  Well, it's not that bad.  That'll...  Okay.  That'll...  Oh, Psycho Mark, you are a friggin' cruel bastard.  Don't do that.  Don't do that.  Don't do that.  Yeah, he is.  No slamming on the top of the barrel.  All right.  Let's move on to the next contestant.  Contestant number three, Kate.  Kate.  Kate.  Yes.  Making her way in.  Kate is the odds-on favorite to be the first one.  No, no.  That was our first impression.  No, that was the first impression.  I thought she'd be the first to come out of the barrel, Anthony. 
[00:28:30]  I might surprise you.  All right.  She is being helped into the barrel.  She's a tall girl.  How tall are you?  Five-seven.  Five-seven.  There goes the...  Oh, very nice.  She went on there.  Very nice.  Black bra, black panties.  Very nice.  Very nice.  Very nice body.  Yes.  Oh, thank you.  All right.  A little photo op of her in her barrel.  Any final words, Kate?  Just leave me in here.  Just leave you in here.  All right.  Just leave me in here so I can win.  Okay.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Our next contestant, let's duct tape her. 
[00:29:00]  Oh, no.  They don't need a duct tape.  Just slam the lid on.  Yeah.  Wait, I want to hear the sound of the lid when you lock it.  Like, it's a Houdini lock.  I'm going to do this before.  Oh, no.  Oh, boy.  These are going to bother me.  Oh, boy.  The lid didn't even go on yet.  She is still the odds-on favorite.  Okay.  There it is.  I got it.  Yeah, she just cursed.  Don't slam the top too much.  All right.  It's locked.  She's got a tap.  It's locked.  She's in.  All right.  It's locked.  She's not a happy man.  Here, stick the mic in there. 
[00:29:30]  Let's see how she...  Kate?  Kate?  Kate.  Hey.  How you doing?  I'm all right.  Are your knees going to bother you?  Oh, boy.  What?  Are your knees really going to bother you?  I don't know.  But they're going to pour the stuff through the holes?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Is that right?  Yeah.  All right.  I need to stay in the middle then.  Dude, odds-on favorite right now.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I know.  She didn't even...  Before the lid got on, she's like, ow, my knees.  Yeah.  You know, it's only four hours to go. 
[00:30:00]  Help me.  Any of the ladies feeling claustrophobic at this point?  A little bit.  A little bit.  Oh, is that Kate?  Who said that?  Oh, Kate.  Oh, my.  She's done.  Kate's a little bit claustrophobic.  Her knees hurt.  And she's asking questions about where the stuff's going to be poured through.  It's over, Johnny.  It's over, Jenny.  All right.  Who's next?  All right.  Contestant number four, Jane.  Jane.  Make your way in.  Jane is wearing her normal, everyday bra and panties, I guess.  She's got a towel wrapped around her.  And she's got a little do-rag on her head. 
[00:30:30]  Yeah, she's got a do-rag to protect her hair.  Very smart.  That's kind of smart.  She's a little shy.  She's ducking into the battle before she removes the towel.  That's all right.  Whatever the ladies want to do.  I mean, this isn't a little sideshow.  Right.  All right.  You're going to keep the towel with you?  Well, I'll take it off once I'm in the barrel.  Oh, okay.  Or, Psycho Mark, just turn the camera off and let her be at peace.  All right.  Very good.  There she goes.  Towel is off.  Hold on. 
[00:31:00]  It's really twisted.  Rick's getting pictures from above before they put the lid on.  That's going to make some good viewing.  Now, wait a minute.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Jane, put your hands on your ears when they fasten this down.  Okay, thanks.  Because it's very loud, and that was hurting the girl's ears.  Okay.  Okay, go ahead.  Put your hands over it.  And go ahead.  Seal it up.  There goes the metal clamp being put on.  It is locked.  All right.  You can uncover your ears now.  I think Kevin's scaring me at how well he's going to do it. 
[00:31:30]  You know, he's got to do it on the top.  He looks a little too proficient about locking girls into 55-gallon drums.  All right.  I'm a little scared.  Put the mic in the hole.  Let's see how Jane's doing so far.  Jane?  Jane?  Yeah?  How you doing?  Um, okay so far.  Do you think you'll be able to last now that you know what the conditions are?  Um, yes, I do.  All right.  Bang on the side of the barrel.  Me?  Yeah.  Okay. 
[00:32:00]  Very good.  Our last girl getting in.  The lovely Tabitha.  Rick's whispering her name, Tabitha.  I think we all know who she is.  Oh, she just took her lingerie.  Oh, my Lord.  That's...  Oh, wow.  Oh, my God.  This is the really wrong...  This is really wrong, man.  Just because she has the nicest lingerie, it's like, who would dress like this for this event?  I'll lift you up.  Yeah.  Hey, Kev, I'm used to putting it in in two pieces.  Right. 
[00:32:30]  I'm not used to just hold the whole girl in at once.  Hey, by the way, where are the guys that paid money to be here today?  They should be in the studio.  They get all access for the show today, man.  Big Kev's like, this is no fun.  The arms and legs match in all the same one barrel.  They're all still attached.  Usually they're mixed and matched.  All right, Tabitha, any final words?  This is no problem.  My first apartment in New York was smaller than that.  I don't know.  Telling jokes and everything.  There you go.  No crickets on that joke.  We got pictures of her?  We got one right now as we're going. 
[00:33:00]  Get some pictures.  There you go.  Did you get one with her standing up, too?  Okay, good.  She's ducking down, getting in position.  She is in the barrel.  Bye-bye.  Oh, my God.  Now, plug up your ears so it doesn't hurt your ears.  And Big Kev, once again, very proficient in locking girls and 55-gallon drums.  That's good.  Where do you want to bury?  I know how to do this.  Look at Christy's barrel, man. 
[00:33:30]  Yeah.  Come on.  One of these things is not like the other.  It's only tipping over on its side.  Is that a tissue?  A tissue?  Yeah.  A tissue?  All right.  You won't get a tissue, you bitch.  Look at Kate peeking out the hole, man.  She's freaking.  Get a picture of that, Rick.  A picture of her peeking her head out the hole.  Yeah, Kate.  A little nervous.  Look at all the girls.  Look at their eyes.  Oh, look at their eyes looking through the holes. 
[00:34:00]  It's so sad.  All right.  Oh, last time you saw eyes looking through stuff like that, it was like slots on a boxcar.  All right.  It's really sad looking.  And the girls are in their barrels.  We're all set.  We're being thrust up, fingers through the holes.  All the girls in the barrel.  And look at that, Obie.  It is exactly 3 o'clock.  Very good.  So we have an exact start time here.  Oh, my God.  Where's the guy that paid $1,000 to be here?  Yeah.  What's your name, man? 
[00:34:30]  Pete Marchados.  Pete, thanks for the money.  We appreciate it.  You guys are welcome.  The girls are watching the documentary.  Yeah.  You know, right?  It's really insane.  And we'll let you dump some crap in on the girls.  We'll let them do whatever he wants.  Thanks a lot.  Do you have any plugs or anything?  No, no.  I just don't want to plug your business or nothing.  You want to stick your junk through the side one?  Jane was a pretty good looking one.  They're all very attractive, girl.  Oh, my God.  Psycho Mark, get away from Christy's barrel.  Something tells me any junk passes by there, it's going to be like a London broil in front of a tiger cage. 
[00:35:00]  All right, Ed.  I guess we've got to take a break.  Yeah, we'll take a break.  And then, with no further ado, I think we should really start the abuse.  Run the camera down the hall so Scott can get those pictures on.  Immediately.  Already done.  Very good.  Doug, what's going on?  Hey, man.  Hey.  Unbelievable.  I'm sitting here in traffic, man.  I'm about to piss my pants. 
[00:35:30]  I hope for the girls' sakes they don't have to.  Dude, I feel really bad because the girls now, they're poking their faces out the little holes to see what's going on.  It doesn't look at us.  It doesn't look at us.  It rubs the lotion on its skin.  It does this whenever it's told.  God damn it.  This is twisted.  Yeah, when we come back from break, we'll start with...  Are we going to really get hard and heavy from the beginning or are we going to start lightly? 
[00:36:00]  No, we'll start a little lightly.  We'll start right after a shopping cart just full of stuff from the grocery store.  All the stuff you pass by in the aisles and go, ooh, I don't know who buys that and who eats that.  All that stuff.  You know, we could have a little side contest, too.  Yeah.  We could dump stuff in there and the girls have to figure out what it is.  That's a good idea.  For bonus prizes.  Bonus prizes, yeah.  For bonus prizes.  Yeah, like CDs and stuff.  Why not? 
[00:36:30]  And also, we're inviting the listeners to come down with their own stuff to throw in the barrel.  Anyone have to cut one?  Anyone have to fart or anything?  Oh, man.  If anyone has to fart, you back up right to one of the holes in the barrel of your choice and let it rip.  All right.  Hey, let's take a break.  Okay.  And we start dumping stuff in the barrels next.  Stay there.  Powered by Opie and Anthony.  Owned by Infinity Broadcasting.  This is 102.7 WNEW.  New York. 
[00:37:00]  This is award-winning broadcasting, Anthony.  Oh, yeah.  We'll get the Edward R. Murr Award for this one.  What is he doing?  What are you doing, Rick?  Tabitha's barrel?  Yeah.  She needed a sip of water, so you're pouring water in the hole into her open mouth?  Yeah.  Dude, how hot is that?  Her husband's out there.  Watch out, man.  I just met her husband.  I just put my foot in my mouth.  Oh, did you?  I go walking out of the studio.  I'm like, man, that Tabitha's a piece of ass. 
[00:37:30]  And the guy goes, thank you.  I'm like, why?  Oh, no.  Why is he saying thank you?  Because I'm her husband.  I'm like, oh, wow.  Oh, dude.  So then I shook his hand and said, congratulations.  Congratulations.  What else do you say at that point?  Hey, Doug, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  How many of these girls have you got in those barrels?  Oh, we got five.  Five girls.  Five.  And where do you get in these barrels?  They're big, plastic, 55-gallon drums.  Hey, can I get something delivered to my house?  Sicko.  Hey, man, I'm listening to this show. 
[00:38:00]  This has got to be the most awesome thing you guys have ever done, man.  Yeah, this is a lot of fun today.  Thank you, bro.  You're awesome, dudes.  You're awesome.  Hey, do we have a group shot of the barrels that we can put on the Internet?  Scott Columbo is trying to get new pictures on WNEW.com, but it's just getting pounded today, Anthony.  Pounded.  I know.  All right, I've got to read some of this instant feedback coming in.  Buffalo Bob, it rubs the chum all over its skin or else it gets Psycho Mark again. 
[00:38:30]  Oh, I'm looking at the picture of Christy getting into her green barrel.  Oh, they're up?  Yeah.  All right.  There's Wendy getting into her barrel.  Picture four.  Oh, look.  Wendy squatting down in her barrel.  The overhead shot.  Awesome.  Looking like a crime photo.  Look at this.  Man, where are you going?  I can't find this.  You've got to refresh.  I did refresh. 
[00:39:00]  There's Tabitha in her barrel.  Boy, if it wasn't for the smiles.  They're smiling on the way in.  I know.  Got to see the way out.  Uh-oh.  Jane looking very angry.  Oh, my God.  Getting into her barrel.  Kate.  Uh-huh.  Yeah, Kate smiling as she's getting ready to get pushed down into her barrel.  Top going on.  Gee, what a surprise.  Another picture of Tabitha.  We've got, like, 10 of Tabitha.  They're all very cute. 
[00:39:30]  And Jane down in the barrel before the lid's getting snapped on.  Great picks.  Cool.  Yes, very good.  Continue snapping away and giving them to Scott.  Big Rob from Manhattan.  My God, Tabitha's a fine piece of ass.  Mito from Hoboken.  Christy is the poster child for Stacker 2.  Aw.  Christy, you hear that?  For what?  For Stacker 2.  Stacker 2.  Maybe we could throw some of those in the holes in the barrel?  Some of those in the stacker?  The girls are peeking out at us through the holes in the barrel. 
[00:40:00]  I know.  Isn't that sad?  Isn't that sad to look at?  Look at them.  Look at them waving and peeking through the holes.  Well, let's start dumping stuff in there.  Hey, Jane.  How you doing?  Kate.  What's up?  Hey, Tony.  What's going on?  Well, I was fishing this weekend.  Yeah.  And I had to work with the chum.  This is the nastiest, most repulsive stuff I've ever smelled.  These girls are going to have it poured on them?  Yeah.  I was dry heaving to this stuff.  It is so repulsive.  These girls are ballsy, my man. 
[00:40:30]  They get props.  Definitely.  All right, Tony.  Thank you.  Later, fellas.  Hey, Anthony.  Yeah.  I didn't mean to do that.  Is he still there?  Tony?  Yeah, I lost.  I'm sorry.  I'm sure it was some snide comment.  We got $2,500 up for grabs, Anthony, for the lady that makes it all the way to seven.  If they all make it to seven, they split the prize money, and they're all getting certificates  from Shrewsbury Bicycle.  Oh, plus other stuff.  We got a concert ticket CDs and all sorts of crap.  They've been in there for 10 minutes or so, so far, and nothing's been dumped on.  This is just a travesty. 
[00:41:00]  Yeah, I think we're all just feeling a little weird, and I think we just got to do it.  I think we just got to do it.  Do we have a remote mic I could use?  All right, let me go over there.  We'll stay over here for now, and we'll take turns.  Hey, am I on?  Oh, I got headphones, too?  Yeah.  Well, this is almost like a professional broadcast.  What a load.  But my headphones don't work.  Now it makes sense.  There we go.  Wow.  Well, I like this mic.  Yeah.  Makes me sound like Barry Wayne.  Hey, Barry.  All right, we're going to start the pouring festivities. 
[00:41:30]  Okay.  We're going to start, I guess, like you'd start any party with a couple of beers.  Okay.  All right?  Some Budweiser?  That's a waste of a mighty fine beer, Anthony.  I'm not talking about pouring it.  Oh.  I'm drinking it.  Okay.  All right.  Oh, look at Kate.  She's looking.  I feel so mad.  She's looking through the hole, and he's like, oh, sad.  You okay, Kate?  Yeah, you all right? 
[00:42:00]  Oh, you know why?  She holds up a bottle in front of the hole, and she's drinking a bun in there, so she doesn't  care.  All right.  That might work against you, Kate, because you're going to have to pay if you drink beer.  You got to get a mic on it.  What are you saying there?  I think the stuff that will be poured on me will probably be worse than that.  Do you think so?  Yeah.  Worse than beer?  Probably.  Yeah.  Well, are you willing, if you really have to go to the bathroom, to just go in there? 
[00:42:30]  Just weigh on myself?  Yeah.  I don't know.  I can hold it.  Who is?  Who said I am?  Put the mic over by Tabitha.  No, Jane and Tabitha.  Jane, are you willing to go to the bathroom on yourself?  Yes, I am.  And Tabitha, are you?  No way.  No?  I have my standards.  Forget it.  All right.  What about Christy?  Are you willing to go to the bathroom on yourself?  No.  Sorry.  No?  Did we ask Wendy?  Is Wendy alive?  Wendy, are you okay?  I'm fine. 
[00:43:00]  Are you willing to go to the bathroom on yourself?  I don't think so.  No?  No.  Hmm.  I'm fine, so I'm correct.  Okay.  I just poured the beer on her head while she was talking.  Notice I started with Wendy.  How are you doing, Wendy?  Oh, it's good for the hair.  All right.  Yeah.  Well, let's start dumping stuff.  Okay.  Let's go.  All right.  Hey, Christy, how are you doing?  All right.  Carrots?  Woo-hoo!  Here, mic the girls as they're getting stuff dumped in. 
[00:43:30]  Taste this.  Wow!  All right.  There you go.  A little bit of beer on Christy.  Have you gone?  Hey, Kate.  How are you doing?  Kind.  What?  Be kind.  Be kind?  Be kind?  I'm trying to look through this hole here.  Hey, how are you doing?  How's that?  God damn, this is fun. 
[00:44:00]  Oh, there you go.  Now you know.  Oh, watch.  Watch.  Yeah, there you go.  She keeps trying to move away, and I see where her head's going, and I just dump it in the  other hole.  After a while, you're just going to have to give up, because they're trying to avoid the  stuff, Anthony.  Here's your point.  Yeah.  Wait.  You know what?  Tabitha and who's the other one over there?  They haven't gotten anything yet.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  All right. 
[00:44:30]  How are you doing, Jane?  Feeling good?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  The squirming is starting, man.  There's a lot of squirming going on.  They're throwing it in there.  This is so twisted.  Okay.  This is so...  They're like squealing as you throw it in.  They're trying so hard to avoid the flow. 
[00:45:00]  You hear that, Mo?  That was just a gasp.  She just went...  All right.  Well, nothing better than the sound of a girl screaming in a 55-gallon drum.  Yeah.  Pour that in.  They are...  Just to give you an idea, we're starting off very easy, right, Anthony?  Beer and water.  Beer and water right now.  Alternating beer and water.  How's everyone feeling? 
[00:45:30]  How we doing?  Good.  Yeah?  I feel like I'm getting abused the most.  Wait, wait.  Wendy, what?  I feel like I'm getting abused the most.  How can you tell?  You're not looking at anyone else.  Yeah, I'm looking at everyone.  All right.  The guy who...  You shut up, or you'll get even more.  Pete?  Where are you from, Pete?  New Jersey.  New Jersey.  And Pete from New Jersey, who gave us $1,000 to hang with us today.  Hey.  He brought some stuff.  He wants some pours.  Girls, this might help you dry off a little bit.  Kitty litter, Opie. 
[00:46:00]  Some kitty litter.  Just get it all in there.  There we go.  Oh, my God.  There we go.  Very good.  Not too much of that, because the dust might be a little bit much, I think.  Yeah, water it down.  They're coughing in there, Anthony. 
[00:46:30]  They're coughing.  Yeah.  Okay, a little...  Well, yeah, yeah.  We've got to ease the dust down a little bit.  I'm going to the vessel.  Kitty litter, my beer!  All right!  What, what?  What?  You okay?  Oh, there's kitty litter in her beer.  She's complaining.  She's pissed off.  I like her.  Do you think any serial killer would even give you beer?  Oh, who's coughing? 
[00:47:00]  They're coughing.  They're coughing.  Maybe you need a drink.  Do we have any of that Sobe beverage over here?  Yeah, give them a Sobe or some water or something.  Yeah.  Oh, now we give them the goggles, you idiots.  Who's coughing?  Wait, Gene?  Oh, both of you?  Here, you want it, Sobe?  It's good stuff.  Why don't we start with the dusty cat litter? 
[00:47:30]  What are you guys, nuts?  Okay, here you go.  Make sure the ladies are okay before we move on, Anthony.  Okay.  Now it feels bad.  You idiot.  No, I don't feel bad.  What's that?  You need some drink?  You okay?  Yeah, I'm all right.  You okay in there?  Yeah.  Say their name so people can play along at home.  Okay.  Christy, are you okay? 
[00:48:00]  Can we rinse out my cleavage?  Rinse out your cleavage?  Yeah, try that.  Little Sobe beverage.  Yeah, yeah.  Keep the water coming.  Now, the other girls, you know what you do?  Turn the fan so it sucks out and put it on top of the thing.  That should clear out.  That's going to bring all the dough.  Yeah, just leave it alone.  No, that sucks it through the sides.  Leave it alone at this point.  Because then we can make a nice scoop on top.  Yeah.  Just don't push any more of that in. 
[00:48:30]  Okay, Ed.  All right, where are we at right now?  Just pouring a little more wonderful Sobe elixir.  So far, we've got Sobe, water, beer, and cat litter in the barrels.  And I've got to say, judging from the sounds coming out of these barrels, these girls aren't really happy anymore.  Really.  Is anybody, let me ask one at a time.  Christy, is your attitude changing on this whole thing?  Not yet.  Wendy?  Not at all.  All right. 
[00:49:00]  Kate?  What?  No more dusty stuff.  Kate, is your whole attitude on this thing changing since you started?  All right.  Uh-oh.  You're all right?  My mouth.  All right, Jane, how are you doing with this whole thing so far?  This is pretty much what I expected.  Okay.  And Tabitha, are you all right?  No problem.  Oh!  All right.  Okay.  I think we have time to drop some more stuff in there.  Oh, no, not like that.  You've got to do it like this. 
[00:49:30]  All right.  We are cracking raw eggs into the barrels now.  Where is she?  Breakfast?  All right.  Oh!  Oh, yeah, that was good.  Have a little shell.  There you go.  Oh, you heard that, right?  What?  Oh!  What happened?  What happened?  Thank you.  What happened?  There's raw egg being broken and thrown in on top of them.  Hey, Jane, how are you doing?  If you've got three cases, just run some egg. 
[00:50:00]  Start throwing them out on your head.  Psycho Mark, I was ready to put the raw egg in one hole, and Psycho Mark saw her head poking through another hole, so he points at it.  I put it right over her head.  And, of course, yeah, Tabitha needs an egg.  Now, you've got to break them.  You've got to break them in there.  There you go.  That was a good one.  Very good.  Oh, they're fighting back. 
[00:50:30]  They're fighting back.  They're fighting back.  That'll just make your torture that much worse.  Okay.  That's what you get for fighting back.  You know what's funny?  Opie, the side holes, you take a bottle, a plastic bottle of water, and just put it through the side hole and squeeze it.  It just goes shooting everywhere.  It's great.  Perhaps you need some water.  Let's get all the eggs in there. 
[00:51:00]  Get all the eggs in there.  Let's break them all and get them all in there.  We've got three cases of eggs going in.  All right.  Anthony, we should take a break.  Oh, my God.  Opie, you should get in on this.  This is really fun.  That's why I'm going to take a break.  This is fun in the sickest way ever.  Now, guys, are just, like, cracking eggs all over these girls.  The eggs are going in, like, four or five at a time at this point. 
[00:51:30]  It's the 55-gallon drug challenge, Anthony.  Hey, that'll teach you to stick your face through the holes.  Hey, what's she doing?  She's fighting back?  Archer!  Archer!  Tabitha's spirit must be broken, Opie.  Yeah, she's fighting back.  She's fighting back.  Another egg right on her head.  All right, she's coming down now.  All right.  Now, wait.  Tabitha's trying to throw stuff back through the hole.  Now they're mixing the cat litter and the raw eggs together. 
[00:52:00]  Let me get that egg.  Hold on, hold on.  Egg in effect!  All right, do the side.  I think you broke her spirit, Anthony.  No, I don't think so.  She's pretty rambunctious.  All right.  You know what the best way to do it is?  If you gently crack the egg, yet hold it in the shell, and then wail it through the side.  Yeah, I got a little on me. 
[00:52:30]  I learned it from you, Psycho Mark, okay?  Yeah, this is a little too much fun.  All right, as the guys continue with the raw eggs, why don't we go down the line and see  how all the ladies are doing before we go to break here.  Okay, right before we go to break, Tabitha.  Tabitha, how are you doing?  No problem.  Tabitha still says, no problem.  Jane, you?  You okay?  I'm fine, thank you.  She's fine.  Kate?  Just banding.  Are you taking a lot of hits with these eggs?  They're loud, and they're hitting me in the face. 
[00:53:00]  They're loud, and they're hitting her in the face, Opie.  Wendy, how are you doing?  All right, you should see it in here, though.  What?  It's like a crime scene?  Oh, disgusting.  It's just begun.  It is a disgusting mess in there.  We've just begun.  And, of course, Christy, how are you holding up?  Well, I found out what eggs and kitty litter make a great exfoliate.  She's exfoliating in there, Opie.  Okay, yeah, let's take a break.  Someone needs to keep track of all the stuff we put in there thus far.  And what have we dumped in there so far, if you can remember? 
[00:53:30]  So far, we started with beer.  Water.  Intermittent spurting of water.  Some sobe.  Uh-huh.  Eggs.  Eggs.  Kitty litter.  Kitty litter.  Yeah, that's about it so far.  We have just begun.  Oh, yeah.  All right, we've got to take a break.  All right, man.  I've got to go clean off.  Oh, this is disgusting.  I have some on my hand.  All right, we're putting a ton of pictures up on WNAW.com.  The website's getting pounded.  Just remember to keep hitting refresh so you can get the latest pictures, okay? 
[00:54:00]  Also, we're doing a WOW sticker stop today starting at 4 o'clock at New Rochelle Toyota.  Gorilla Boy Jeff Norris will be there handing out the brand-new WOW stickers just in time for this fine weekend.  We're going to have New Rochelle Toyota is located on Cedar Street, 47 Cedar Street in New Rochelle, across from the Ramada Inn.  So make sure you stop by and get your WOW stickers.  We'll be back.

[00:54:30]  You'll love it.  Oh, we love Paisano.  Down there all the time.  Romance of Italy.  Warm, relaxed restaurant.  Incredible, authentic Italian cuisine made from old-world Italian recipes.  Perhaps we'll throw some old-world Italian recipes in the barrels on top of the girls.  We should be nice guys and get some gift certificates or something that we could give them to.  I'm sure Joey would come through.  Well, portions of Paisano, huge, as huge as Christy. 
[00:55:00]  Yeah.  Oh, come on.  Incredible pasta lunch specials, too.  Ask for Joey, the owner, get a glass of wine on the house.  And Paisano's got a great wine list, too.  So check that out.

And you're listening to Hopi and the guy that wants to be me show.  On WNEW 102.7.  Hey, we're listening to Dave.  It's FU Friday.  We're in the middle of the 55-gallon drum challenge, Anthony.  Yeah.  $2,500 up for grabs. 
[00:56:00]  Got a Shrewsbury bicycle as well.  Thank you, Shrewsbury bicycle.  I had to go into the bathroom and sponge off a little, Hopi.  It was disgusting.  I got a little egg on my hand and it was getting sticky.  And then I did get some on my pants, too.  So, I don't know.  It was really disgusting.  What are they pouring on the ladies now?  A little water going into the barrels.  You hear them squeak every so often.  I'm going to go back over to the barrels. 
[00:56:30]  Get on my remote mic.  I got to get a remote mic.  I got to get in on this, too.  So, Buffalo Bill from West Islip.  Psycho Mark, don't stick the butterflies down their throats just yet.  All right.  There we are.  Donald from White Plains.  And remember, Christy was talking about emptying out her cleavage or whatever.  Rinsing out her cleavage.  Well, Donald says to rinse out Christy's cleavage, you would have to reroute the Hudson River.  Oh, my God.  That's not nice.  Come on.  All right, girls.  We have another mic over there.  You doing all right? 
[00:57:00]  Wendy, you okay?  Yeah, I'm okay.  All right.  Everyone's okay.  Tabitha, good?  Yeah.  Jane?  I'm all right.  Okay, everyone's good.  Kate?  Dandy.  Dandy.  They're not sounding as chipper as they were, but that's okay.  And they got, what, three and a half hours to go, Anthony?  Yeah.  All right, don't tell them what's being dumped in.  See if they can guess.  We're opening up the next group of stuff.  All right.  Well, they're looking out.  Oh, yeah.  Out the halls. 
[00:57:30]  They can figure it out in a way.  So, hey, hey, how you doing?  Oh, look, you're covering up.  How you doing, Kate?  Good?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You like that?  Yeah.  That's nasty.  Hey, hey, Wendy.  Yeah?  Hey, Jay.  How's that?  Yeah.  That's pretty good.  Christy?  We don't forget about you.  And you're right.  This is fun. 
[00:58:00]  Tabitha?  Hey, Christy didn't really make that much of a noise.  Is Tabitha talking anymore?  You should see the inside of this thing.  This is so cool.  Hey, Jane.  How you doing?  Banana juice.  What happened?  All right, there goes the, what happened, Jane?  I just got some in my mouth.  Well, and I guess we could tell everyone we just poured a ton of corn oil in.  She's got it.  Corn oil, yeah.  Okay.  I don't think Christy has enough.  Christy a little more.  There we go.  We got some through the halls like that. 
[00:58:30]  It is a mess in the studio.  Oh, man.  Yeah, it's really, really a mess.  And I got the next ingredient.  What is that?  Let me look.  Right on Kate's hair.  Yeah.  Oh, gross.  That is gross.  All right.  Let's go to Christy here.  I got some over here.  Did you get Wendy yet?  What?  I love this.  Wendy.  Wendy, you get any of this yet?  I love this. 
[00:59:00]  It's lotion.  Yeah, lotion.  It's good.  It rubs the lotion on its skin or gets the hose again.  Mm, that smells good.  All right.  Yeah, that's the nicest thing we've dumped into the house so far, Anthony.  Some lotion.  That's not bad.  So we got the oil in there.  Wait.  You got to enjoy that.  Let me out that oil.  Come on.  Oh, there's only a little left.  Who should get it?  I think Tabitha got enough oil.  Kate got it in the face, though, right?  Yeah.  Was that Kate? 
[00:59:30]  Did you get it in the mouth?  Oh, that was Jane?  Oh, then here you go, Kate.  You all right?  I'm all right.  Very good.  Are the listeners starting to show up upstairs?  Yeah.  Did they bring anything interesting?  Bringing their own little goodies.  Some guys have brought some eggs.  Some other guys have brought some other.  The egg's a very popular item.  Bring them down in just a little bit to also dump their stuff.  All right.  Very good.  All right.  Oh, this is nice.  Look at what we got here.  Give me one of those.  Look what we got here.  Okay.  We got our next ingredient. 
[01:00:00]  Oh, my God.  Hello, Wendy.  Wendy, I see you with your hands and the lotion and everything.  How are you doing?  Is that nice and smooth?  Yeah.  Thanks.  This, I hear, is good for your hair.  Good.  Oh, whoa, whoa.  Did she curse?  No.  All right.  I'm back near the board.  Okay.  Kate.  How are you doing?  Hey.  What is that?  They're dumping V8.  V8 juice.  Oh, it's like V8-er.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's exactly what it is. 
[01:00:30]  It's V8 juice.  Little V8.  All right.  Hey.  Hey, Christy.  What's up?  How are you doing?  I'm doing good.  Oh, it's warm.  It's warm and slippery.  Yes, it's V8.  It's V8.  Look into it.  All right.  And, of course, Tabitha.  How are you doing?  How are you doing?  I'm doing good.  I want to watch it.  Oh.  Are you holding up?  Oh. 
[01:01:00]  Are you holding up okay?  Yeah.  God, it sounds disgusting.  Yeah, because...  Now it's like puddling up on the bottom, so they're just hanging out in this crap.  Hey!  All right.  We got...  The sounds have come out.  It's just great, man.  Yeah.  And talk to the girls while the other guys, you know, pour the stuff.  All right.  Let's see how they feel.  Let's start with Christy.  Christy doesn't seem to mind any of this.  No.  You okay, Christy?  That's right. 
[01:01:30]  I can't.  I can't.  I can't.  I can't.  I can't.  Wait.  What's putting two friggin' mics in on the barrel at once?  Yeah.  If you don't have headphones on, don't move the mics right now.  All right.  They're throwing stuff back at us.  All right.  Tabitha's rambunctious.  And start again with Christy.  Christy, you're okay, right?  Yes.  And you don't mind any of this?  No.  This is cool.  It's cool.  You know what, though?  Christy, even though she's a bigger girl, has a lot more headroom in there than the other  girls do.  All right.  Then she should get more stuff, though, thrown in. 
[01:02:00]  Yeah.  Wendy, how are you holding up?  Okay.  Okay.  Is this getting really disgusting?  No, it's not disgusting.  I just have to try not to scream so it doesn't get in my mouth.  Oh, okay.  I hear you.  Oh!  All right.  They're just pouring like...  There you go.  Kate, you okay?  You okay?  Cleaner after container of V8 in here.  You're all right?  Mm-hmm.  I feel like I'm backing Kyle.  Ugh!  Yeah, she's doing all right.  Jane, how are things in your barrel? 
[01:02:30]  I can't see through my goggles anymore.  Oh, that's a shame.  Oh, my.  That's too bad.  You tag-teamed her that one through the holes with two things.  Now, Tabitha's barrel, I'm a little afraid to get in the air.  She is truly the badger of this group.  Yeah.  She's throwing things back.  Yeah.  She's getting a little nasty.  And she's like a monkey at the zoo throwing feces back at us, you know?  Throwing feces.  So, I think the only way to really cure that is with applesauce. 
[01:03:00]  Oh, God.  There you go.  You know...  How's that working for you?  Jane, you need some applesauce?  There you go.  The ingredients are starting to mix nicely in the barrels.  Oh, yeah.  That's Kate.  The studio's starting to smell a little bit.  A little.  There you go.  Hey, Wendy, what's up?  Nothing.  How's that?  That was...  She might have enjoyed that.  Yeah.  And, of course, Christy, applesauce coming in. 
[01:03:30]  You might want to open up.  Very good.  Very good.  Not much left after that.  Okay.  What?  No cinnamon?  No, but we...  Yeah.  We'll put a little of that in there.  What is that?  A little more Sobe.  Sobe.  Thank you, Sobe.  How to wash it down.  Sobe's great.  Okay.  Wow, they are really...  They are in a mess at this point. 
[01:04:00]  Oh, oh.  Yeah, okay.  A little more of that.  You might need that.  God, we're just getting more stuff.  I know.  This is too much fun.  And as well of other things.  Wendy, are you thinking at all about pulling out so far?  Absolutely not.  Christy, you?  Not yet.  No.  Kate, how are you doing? 
[01:04:30]  Are you thinking at all about pulling out of this?  Oh, I'm fine.  Thank you.  She's now thanking...  Ah, I've heard hostages do this sometimes.  They start liking their captors.  Jane, you thinking about any second thoughts now?  You might want to get out.  Oh, no, I'm sure it's doing wonders for my skin.  Okay.  And of course, Tabitha, any thoughts about getting out of this thing at this point?  Not yet.  Not yet?  Not yet.  Oh, she doesn't sound the same anymore. 
[01:05:00]  No, not at all.  See, she made the mistake of fighting back.  Yeah.  Psycho Mark just turned over a big thing of V8 right on top of the barrel, and it's just  It's just pouring in the holes now.  All right.  Anthony.  Maybe we can pop this top off.  Anthony, ask the ladies what it smells like in the barrels at this point.  Yeah, how is...  They're pumping it into Tabitha really bad.  Let me ask Tabitha something, if I may. 
[01:05:30]  Tabitha.  Up.  They are really pounding her.  What does it smell like in there?  Oh, man, I don't know.  A lot of different things, dude.  Yeah.  You know what?  I don't see any girls named Mary here, Opie.  No.  But how about we just make big, bloody Marys out of all of them?  We've already had the V8, right?  And now how about a little Worcestershire sauce?  Oh, that'll make it smell nice, Jane, a little bit. 
[01:06:00]  That'll mix well with the cat litter.  Wendy.  Oh, Wendy.  And oh, yeah.  Christy, a little Worcestershire for you?  That stuff really stinks.  Hey, ask Jane what it smells like in the barrel.  Jane, what do you think it smells like in there?  Well, at first it was the overwhelming stench of tomato juice, but now it's the overwhelming stench of Worcestershire sauce.  Yeah, that Worcestershire is hard.  Kate, what do you think?  It's smelling pretty bad in there? 
[01:06:30]  It's better than all the other mixers.  The Worcestershire washes it all out.  The Worcestershire washes it all out.  Wendy, stinky in there or what?  Oh, it's disgusting.  It's disgusting.  And Christy, what do you think?  It smells like a steak.  She smells like a steak.  Another food reference from Christy.  Very nice.  Two-fitty in her big landscaper barrel.  All right, eh.  It really stinks.  Hey, come back over here.  I can only imagine being in a closed spot.  Come on, come here.  Hey, were you flinging something at me, Kate? 
[01:07:00]  Kate, were you just flinging something at me?  No.  No.  Your fingers didn't just, uh...  No.  Obi, I think she was flinging something at me.  Oh, no.  Gee, you must pay now.  You must pay, Kate.  A little more beer on Kate.  They must learn.  Ben is running out of the studio to get more stuff, Anthony, to throw in there.  All right, I'm going to come back over to my mic.  As Ant makes his way over here, so far, if I'm keeping track of this, we've got eggs in 
[01:07:30]  there, sobe, beer, water, kitty litter, V8, lotion, corn oil, and steak sauce, right?  Uh, ladies, ladies, just so you know, you are only 44 minutes into this whole thing.  That's it.  That's it.  We're going to have to have the...  We're going to have to put in something very nasty soon.  Yeah.  So far, they are really, uh, putting up with all this. 
[01:08:00]  Tabitha just, uh, fighting back.  I think, uh, every hour end is when we throw in something really nasty.  Yeah.  Every hour.  So at 4 o'clock, it could be the sour milk.  It could be the chum.  At 4 o'clock.  It could be the bugs.  4 o'clock, we start getting really nasty, ladies.  Or it could be the rats.  What?  What?  All right, let's go to the phones.  People are losing it.  Doug, what's going on? 
[01:08:30]  Hey, Doug.  Hey, what's up?  How are you, buddy?  Listen, three real quick things.  One, I just want to say, look what I did to you now.  Again.  Again.  Yeah.  And the other thing is, is I'm doing the same thing for my housekeeper in the basement.  Yeah.  I want to keep real good track of what you're putting in there.  So make sure you go slow when you read the list.  All right.  And I keep picturing that Bugs Bunny cartoon.  What's the one?  When it becomes like the soup.  Oh, yeah.  I keep throwing it in the bucket. 
[01:09:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You guys rock.  Thank you.  The WNW website just getting hammered.  We got pictures up there.  WNW.com.  One of the girls is waving.  Make sure she's okay.  We want to make sure the ladies are okay with everything thus far.  Brendan, what's going on?  Yeah, how you doing?  I know the bug guys.  I was at the house last night.  You got to dump something on them.  All right.  They're nasty.  We'll see.  We might do that soon.  You got to do it.  All right. 
[01:09:30]  All right?  Thank you, Brendan.  You're welcome.  Let's go to Stacy.  Stacy, what's up?  Stacy.  Yeah, hello.  I want to play Guess What's in Tabitha's pants.  A lot of gunk right now.  A lot of junk right now.  Yeah?  Yeah.  All right.  I'm over here now.  All right.  Thank you, Stacy.  All right, Ann.  We're doing well so far, huh?  Yeah.  The girl's really putting up with this.  But we're not even an hour into this yet.  No.  Every hour is when we throw something really nasty in, and that's within 10 or 15 minutes. 
[01:10:00]  As a matter of fact, when we get back from break, we're going to throw something really nasty.  That's something really heinous.  That may make one of the ladies quit, Anthony.  Yeah.  They're doing the challenge for $2,500.  Cold, hard cash.  Cold, hard cash.  All right.  It really stinks in here.  I know.  It does, right?  Yeah, absolutely.  How are you guys doing?  I can only imagine what it would be like in a closed barrel.  Right.  I mean, I couldn't imagine it.  Are you guys all having fun checking this out?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah?  Good.  All right, Anthony. 
[01:10:30]  All right.  Let's take a break.  It looks so gross over there.  Let's play the serial killer song.  Very appropriate today.  Yes.  And we'll be back.  Stay there.  I made quite a splash.  I hacked and I slashed.  My way to the top of page one.  The cops even checked, but they didn't suspect. 
[01:11:00]  I was carving up fellers for fun.  Guess I never thought I'd finally get caught.  I hope that they all rest in peace.  Cause I'm locked away.  What more can I say?  Except what I told the police.  Oh, I got friends in crawl spaces.  I got arms and legs and a few faces stashed all around in different parts of town. 
[01:11:30]  Well, I met them in bars on a friendly basis.  Now I got them in jars and flower bases.  Oh, I got friends in crawl spaces.  I know I was wrong.  I just don't belong. 
[01:12:00]  I guess you've heard that one before.  But the guys, they all dig me.  I'm like Eleanor Rigby.  There's a face in a jar by my door.  I must be insane.  Got an abnormal brain.  What else could I do to get laid?  The guys that I date had a terrible fate.  They ended up lightly sauteed. 
[01:12:30]  Oh, I got friends in crawl spaces.  Every shape and size.  And all races.  All blood and good.  Man, I must be nuts.  Well, I got one that'll really kill you.  I'm the poster child for necrophilia.  Oh, I got friends in crawl spaces. 
[01:13:00]  Oh, I'm a really good guy, huh?  Well, I got friends in crawl spaces.  I'm the that made Milwaukee famous.  So, I got friends in crawl spaces.  Opie and Anthony.  1027 WNEW.  Oh, my God. 
[01:13:30]  It's starting to stink in here.  Anthony, the Razor Rollerboard Scooter from Sharper Image.  Yes, we love these things.  I drove in today.  I saw a couple on 57th Street.  Yeah.  They're all over the place.  It's the hottest new product this summer.  What are you loving?  I'm just trolling through the pictures.  Yeah, there's some great pictures at WNEW.com.  Amazing pictures, actually.  Just a little disturbing.  All right, it's the Razor Rollerboard Scooter.  The hottest new product this summer.  A lot of people are starting to, you know, pick up on that.  They're getting them.  They're cool, right? 
[01:14:00]  Cutting-edge technology, gleaming stainless steel, aluminum, inline skate.  You'll love them.  They're a lot of fun, man.  Like Opie said, everybody's on these things these days.  And they got the online wheels.  They're lightweight.  You can fold them up.  Adjustable locking steering arm, Opie.  Right.  That folds down for convenient storage and transport.  I know it was funny.  The ladies, they were getting ready to go into the barrels.  And they come tooling down the hallway in the Razor Rollerboard Scooter.  And they're like, oh, we thought you were kidding.  I'm like, no, this is our transportation around here. 
[01:14:30]  We love these damn things.  I get pissed when I'm in the back office and I don't see one leaning against the wall.  Yeah.  Like, hey, someone hocked my ride, man.  I got to walk all the way to the studio?  No.  I love them.  Everyone is tooling around on these things.  It's almost to the point where it's dangerous in here.  We're going to need lights at intersections.  All right, they're available from the Sharper Image.  Visit one of their stores or go online at SharperImage.com.  I'm sure there's a nice picture of the Razor Rollerboard Scooter.  You can also win by visiting any New York area Sharper Image store and filling out an entry blank. 
[01:15:00]  Each store will give away five Razors on Sunday, June 25th.  No purchase necessary.  Winner need not be present.  It's the Razor Rollerboard Scooter from the Sharper Image.  Powered by Opie and Anthony.  Owned by Infinity Broadcasting.  This is 102.7 WNEW New New York.  Are we having fun yet, guys, or what, huh?  Yes.  If you're just tuning in, it's the 55-gallon drum challenge, Anthony.  Lots of great pictures on the WNEW.com website. 
[01:15:30]  Oh, yeah.  I was just looking through them.  They're pretty tragic when you just see a hole in the side of a barrel with a sad eye poking out of it.  And maybe the other hole next to it has a couple of fingers, a couple of gooey fingers hanging out of it.  It's kind of frightening.  We've got to thank Scott Columbo working his ass off down the hall for the show.  Thank you, Scott.  Putting those pictures up really quick.  The pictures are at WNEW.com, not at our Foundry Music site.  A lot of people seem confused. 
[01:16:00]  Yeah, no.  We'll get some stuff over to Steve after the festivities.  Psycho Market is taking a lot of great video for that, so don't worry about that.  Go to WNEW.com today.  There's Anthony.  There's Anthony dumping some beer into one of the barrels.  Yes.  We've got 30 pictures up so far, Anthony.  Yeah.  All right.  There's going to be hundreds by the time we're done today.  We've got fans in here.  We've got the vacuum going.  Right when you walk in, because I went to the office during the break for a little bit, 
[01:16:30]  right when you walk down the hall into the whole studio area, it smells like a steakhouse.  It smells like...  You just smell Worcestershire sauce.  Yeah, that's all I smell right now.  Yeah, but that smell is about to change drastically.  Yes, it is, because it is the first hour of the competition.  We've got four little challenges.  Every hour, we're going to put something really, really nasty into the barrel.  Yeah.  We've got to get some of these girls out of here, man.  Yeah, this is just nothing.  This is food products.  I think they're getting lulled into a false sense of security. 
[01:17:00]  Well, you quieted them down, Anthony.  They were a little run-functioning.  They were a little rowdy at first.  Damn you!  Yeah.  Damn you!  But they're not saying much these days.  They're kind of just mellowing out.  Let me get over by the barrels again.  All right.  Ed, I've got to say, we've put the steak sauce in, hand lotion, V8 beer, kitty litter, water,  Sobe, eggs, and I believe corn oil.  I think that's all we've put in thus far.  Yeah, that's about it.  Oh, my God.  I see the assortment of goodies up here and our special secret surprise. 
[01:17:30]  Well, the secret surprise is going to enter the studio in about five minutes, so.  Yeah.  All right, Anthony.  Let's make sure none of this gets dumped over.  Why don't we get an update from the ladies?  Let's see.  Okay, they've been simmering, more annoying, as you will, for the entire break.  Christy, how are you doing?  I think I'm fully married.  Thank you.  You're feeling good?  Yes.  There's no chance of you backing out as of yet?  Yeah, none at all.  All right. 
[01:18:00]  Anthony, this just in from the instant feedback.  Christy's not making any noise because she's eating whatever is being poured into the barrel.  Jesus Christ.  People are awful.  Christy, I can't.  I got my hands at the top.  Oh.  Yeah, I see that.  Okay.  Wendy?  Yeah?  Wendy!  Yeah?  How are you, Wendy?  All right.  Yeah?  It's nasty in here, but it's not going to get any out of it.  Can I ask you, how much liquid is at the bottom of your drum?  Oh, I can't even see my toes.  Really?  It's just a big, slimy, slush pit that you're sitting in? 
[01:18:30]  So many colors in here.  Whoa.  Every time I move, it just squishes.  Yeah.  Well, she's still motivated.  Wendy's still in this game, Anthony.  Yeah, I know.  By the way, OK Terrific is pointing out that everyone has to drink if you're playing the O&A drinking game.  I did do an impression today.  Thank you.  Oh, what did you do?  I did the, it puts the lotion on.  Oh, OK.  Yeah, drink, drink.  It was a good one, too.  Kate?  Yeah?  How are you doing?  I'm all right.  You're not thinking of backing out?  No.  No, huh? 
[01:19:00]  Definitely not.  And you have a lot of sludge in the bottom of your barrel, I would gather?  Yeah, quite a bit.  I'm trying not to look, though.  Why?  It's making you sick?  Probably.  Wait, no, Kate was the one we thought would drop out first.  She's sounding a little more positive now.  She is.  OK.  Things change.  Things change.  And Jody Foster checking in from Washington, D.C.  We at the FBI are putting together a profile of you two as we speak.  That's not too hard to do.  Hey, Jane.  Yes.  How are you doing?  I'm all right.  Yeah?  Yeah, the steak sauce was kind of rough, though. 
[01:19:30]  That was rough?  It burned.  It burned?  Yeah, we've got to stay away from the stuff that burns.  I was thinking that, too.  How does steak sauce burn?  Well, it got in my eyes.  Yeah, that's...  Aw, I thought you had your goggles on.  There's holes in the top.  Oh.  What's that, Wendy?  It doesn't work.  It goes right there.  Oops.  We're cheap around here.  We've got the cheapest.  You're lucky you're not getting hacked up.  Right.  And, of course, Tabitha? 
[01:20:00]  Tabitha?  Tabitha?  Yeah, hey.  Oh.  Wait, Tabitha's boot has drastically changed.  Tabitha, you are the perky one.  You are really psyched for this.  And now I'm detecting a change in your voice.  How are you doing?  No, no.  No problem.  She's not as happy.  Now, you were fighting back, and you paid the price for that.  Yeah, no kidding.  You're flinging it like a monkey flinging feces from his cage at the zoo.  And you're having to be reprimanded.  I would bet money she has more stuff at the bottom of the barrel than anyone. 
[01:20:30]  How much goop do you have at the bottom of your barrel?  It's about six inches.  Six inches.  Everyone else, their toes are barely covered.  Yeah.  And she's up to six inches.  I can see her bra.  It used to be nice white color.  Not anymore.  Yeah, Tabitha had the really nice lingerie, and now it's a different color.  Yeah, how are you doing in there?  I look like Carrie.  Oh, my God.  She looks like Carrie.  Oh, God.  Well, we've just begun.  It's only the first hour, girls.  Ant, this just in, I was just talking to the boss, Bruce Springsteen, and he's outraged, 
[01:21:00]  and he's writing a song called Locked in a Barrel.  All right.  Wow.  Okay.  Well, one thing I've noticed with everything that we've dumped in there so far, it all has  a common denominator.  Yeah.  In that it is not very sticky.  Right.  Nothing we've dumped in so far has really been sticky.  They could probably, as we dump water in, just brush their hands over their head and 
[01:21:30]  wash off a lot of the stuff that we've dumped in there.  This must end.  Start over there just to...  Okay.  Ah.  I won't say what it is yet, but it is an old favorite, isn't it?  Yes, it is.  Yes.  Let's go over to Tabitha.  Tabitha, how are you doing?  Close your mouth.  Where are I?  Oh, you're over there.  Don't look up at me.  Oh, God. 
[01:22:00]  She's not liking that.  What is this?  What is this?  She's saying it.  Oh.  Oh.  A lot of ewes.  Isn't that disgusting?  Oh, my God.  Oh, she's not happy.  This is bad, right?  It's got to be enough.  No, no.  There's plenty for everybody.  I just made it.  We have a full bottle for everyone.  Yes.  There you go.  It's only 55 gallons, dude.  Ant, you're enjoying this way too much. 
[01:22:30]  That was good.  All right, let's go to Jane's.  Jane, are you ready?  Yeah.  Okay, here it comes.  Yuck.  Oh, yuck.  Oh, my God.  Oh, this is just...  It's syrup.  Yes, it is, of course, Aunt Jemima syrup.  Yes.  Syrup, uh...  Oh, my God.  I hate sticky.  I hate sticky.  I couldn't imagine this stuff all over me. 
[01:23:00]  Kate.  Hey.  How you doing?  I'm all right.  You ready for this?  Here.  There you go.  There we go.  Oh.  Isn't that lovely?  That feel good?  Is it sticky?  Actually, it smells better than the worst of you.  Yeah, it does smell better, but believe me, after a few minutes, when that stuff starts  crystallizing on you, it's going to be pretty bad.  I would forget about your sense of smell, because that's going to drastically change.  Wendy's up.  Why don't we put the mic right there? 
[01:23:30]  How are we doing?  You doing okay?  Okay.  Let's...  Are you trying to avoid me?  No.  No?  Oh.  Let me just dump a little in all the holes.  Oh.  It's so funny, and I've got to explain this.  There's like six holes on the top of each drum, and the girls, they can look through one  hole, and they're just...  They're moving around, trying to avoid the liquid as you're poured in the different holes.  Hey.  Christy.  Now we're up to Christy. 
[01:24:00]  Uh, how you doing?  Good.  That flesh sucks.  Wow, look at her.  She's like, oh, this is a perfect vantage point.  How's that?  Oh, that feels...  Very odd.  Oh, gross.  That is gross.  Oh, my dad, I'm a yee.  Oh, God, is that gross?  Oh.  Okay.  Aunt Jemima syrup.  What are you pouring in there now?  A little water. 
[01:24:30]  A little water.  They need a little more water.  Well, you know something?  Water just doesn't wash away syrup.  I like mine with syrup.  What do we got next for the ladies?  How about these?  What do you think?  Yes.  Oh, God.  The smell is going to drastically change.  And, uh, ladies, this isn't the really disgusting stuff.  Still.  This is all just edible, uh, stuff.  Right.  All right.  Then, this, the, the, let me talk for a second.  Yeah.  The disgusting stuff is getting prepared outside the studio. 
[01:25:00]  Yeah.  Uh, any of you girls, uh, ever seen the movie Tommy?  Uh, how about this?  Oh, God!  Oh, God!  Oh, gross.  That, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm.  Wait, talk to Wendy.  She's freaking out.  Wendy, how you doing?  Oh!  What's the matter? 
[01:25:30]  Oh!  You all right?  Oh, that's disgusting!  What?  I thought we were all having fun.  She did not like that one, Anthony.  No, that really affected, uh, Wendy.  We don't want to give away what would happen.  No, not yet.  I think everyone can figure it out, but.  Mm-hmm.  All right, we're going to go to a Christy over here.  Hey, hey, Christy, what's up?  I'm not looking up.  Oh! 
[01:26:00]  Oh!  Oh, I'm looking at it through the hole.  That is so sick.  That is disgusting.  Okay.  Ah.  All right, let's move on.  Yeah, let's go.  Who do we got here?  Kate?  Hey, how you doing, Kate?  I'm all right.  Uh, don't worry, because we're going to dump it right on Tabitha.  The surprise.  Tabitha?  I was supposed to be last, Henry.  No. 
[01:26:30]  See, I mixed the order up.  It screwed them up.  Okay.  Who will it be?  Jane or Kate?  Hmm.  Jane or Kate?  Eenie, meenie, minie, minie.  That's what serial killers do, I'll be.  They taunt, they taunt their prey.  How you doing, Kate?  What's up?  Okay.  Jane, how you doing?  I'm fine, thanks.  You've heard the reaction of the other girls to this.  Yeah.  It's pretty bad?  Doesn't sound good.  No, it doesn't, does it? 
[01:27:00]  No, no, no.  So you can skip me if you'd like.  You want me to skip you?  All right, we'll go with Kate first.  Ah, no, we won't.  Oh, my God.  Okay.  Big beans being dumped on the girls.  And one more can.  Guess who's left, Kate?  Hmm.  Same for us.  You.  How you doing?  Are you covering your face? 
[01:27:30]  And, and, and, and.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Just remind me of something.  Do your scream voice.  Hello, Sidney.  Hey, what's up?  I'm, I'm, I'm looking in the hall trying to get a good vantage point.  That looks good.  That looks good, too.  Oh, thank you.  Right in the doom.  Yeah.  What the hell is that?  What do you think?  Sloppy Joe?  No.  Sloppy Joe.  No.  No, Sloppy Joe's waiting to come in.  Wait till you see what he's got for you. 
[01:28:00]  Oh, God.  Okay, the whole can.  The whole can.  Very good.  All right.  Big beans, Sloppy.  That's what it was.  Yes.  Full of big beans.  Let's get one more thing in there, and then we'll bring in the surprise from outside.  This is really, really bad.  Because, like I said before, I don't like sticky.  Yeah.  The Anjomima syrup would have been great.  This has got to be the worst thing yet.  We only have two jars of this. 
[01:28:30]  Okay, I have to divvy it up.  Yeah, divvy it up, Anthony.  All right.  Hey, Wendy.  She goes, oh, shh.  I know.  She just cursed.  She tried.  How you doing?  You feeling that?  What is that?  Get Micah.  Ew.  Ew.  Ew.  Wendy's saying, yes, ew.  Okay.  Ew.  Without warning.  Ew.  They're not fighting as much anymore, Ann. 
[01:29:00]  It's just big globs.  It is big globs.  Hey, what's up?  Oh, that's a lot of honey, is it?  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Ding, ding, ding.  Winner.  Winner.  Honey.  And you know something?  That's the end of the first jar.  But since you identified what it was, give me the other one.  You get a little extra.  There we go.  That's good.  We got... 
[01:29:30]  Hmm.  Who have I forgotten so far?  It's in her ear.  Jane?  Oh, I almost...  Jane.  Jane, I almost forgot you.  Oh.  Look at that.  Damn me.  Oh.  How could I forget?  That's pretty bad, huh?  Oh, God.  It's that sticky.  And, of course, Christy.  Christy, what's up?  How are you doing?  Waiting for the yucky stuff.  How's that? 
[01:30:00]  I would flow so slowly and you're putting it between my fingers.  Ah!  God!  Anne, ask Christy how many of the ingredients she's tried so far.  Have you eaten anything that's gone in there, Christy?  No, I haven't.  I'm sorry.  Ladies and gentlemen in the studio, please keep your hands and feet away from the hopper  at all times.  Hey, Anne, Tom from Woodridge.  Hey, guys, any chance we could get Ziggy clothes in the barrel?  Now, that would be too cruel.  Yeah. 
[01:30:30]  Wow.  How's it going, ladies?  How's that sticky stuff, Wendy?  Like the syrup and the honey?  Is that a marked difference from the rest of the stuff we put in?  What's that?  I can't get it off, but it's silly.  Ugh.  I can't even describe it.  See, it won't come off, Opie.  It won't come off.  I know.  Not even.  Look, I have a full thing of really cold water here, and I'm just going to pour it in Jane's  barrel.  Oh, boy.  But it doesn't wash off.  It's not washing off.  No.  I can't wait to see the after pictures of these girls. 
[01:31:00]  We got the before pictures on NAW.com.  When they step out of these barrels, it's going to be pretty funny to make the contrast.  All right, Anne.  Now they're screaming.  Now they're squealing.  Dumping a lot more water in there.  Really cold water.  Mix it up a bit.  Okay.  All right.  Anthony, we are time.  It is time for the first surprise. 
[01:31:30]  Yes.  We have three, maybe four surprises today.  Mm-hmm.  These are the things that are going to decide, I think.  Yeah.  You know, the stuff we've been pouring in as of yet is one thing, but this.  All right.  Oh, this is some deciding.  All right, hold on.  Hold on.  Let's not keep this uncapped too long.  All right, hold on.  So put the cap back on so we're ready to utilize.  All right.  All right.  Wait, wait, wait.  This is how we've got to do it.  We want all the ladies to be surprised at the same time, okay?  All right, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  I can't take it. 
[01:32:00]  All right, listen.  We want all the ladies to be surprised at the same time, so we need five guys over the  barrels with the surprise to drop in at the exact same time.  Oh, my God.  I can't breathe.  All right.  Oh, we'll do this on...  Oh, my God.  Okay, hold on.  Hold on.  That one per barrel will do the trick.  One per barrel.  And then cap that barrel back up.  Okay, ready?  Someone mic the barrels, because this is...  Yeah, get a mic on each one.  All right, this could be a good...  All right, on three, on my cue, guys. 
[01:32:30]  Ready?  Wait, wait, we need one more over here.  All right.  All right, everyone line up to a barrel.  We've got a ton of listeners in the studio today, Anthony.  All right, here we go.  Anthony, why don't you give the one, two, three.  You're closer.  All right, ready?  One, two, three.  Drop them.  Oh, my God.  Okay.  They're screaming, Opie. 
[01:33:00]  All right, we are going to lose some girls.  All right, guys, move out of the way so we can interview the girls.  It's in there.  All right, wait.  Let me make sure the ladies understand.  I have two fish.  All right, listen.  Make sure the ladies understand.  If those fish end up on the floor outside the barrel, they are out of the contest.  Right.  Do not throw your fish out, ladies.  Dead fish in the barrel, Anthony.  Why don't you talk to the ladies?  Go to Christy first.  Okay.  Yeah, Christy.  Yeah.  How are you doing? 
[01:33:30]  You got a friend, do you?  Yeah, I do.  Yeah.  He's supposed to have a little bit more room than everybody else does.  He stinks a little bit, though, doesn't he?  I can't smell nothing over this, honey.  Really?  Yeah.  She's just had a dump out of her.  Sorry.  Yeah, dump that in there.  Let's dangle it a little.  Oh, my God.  She just started shaking that front like crazy.  How about dangling one through a hole and then don't drop it right away? 
[01:34:00]  Maybe Kate would like that.  And talk to him, though.  Wendy.  How are you doing, Wendy?  I'm sorry, Wendy.  Now, see that?  Make it touch her.  What is that she wants to know?  Oh, you can't see it?  Maybe you need another one.  Throw another one in there.  Don't worry, Lucy. 
[01:34:30]  All right.  Hold on.  We had it somehow.  Hold on.  We dumped one up.  It splats.  And she goes, what the eff is that?  Yeah.  Okay.  All right.  And talk to the girls.  Wendy seems like she's really losing it.  Yeah.  Wendy.  How are you doing, Wendy?  Yep.  It's staring at her.  All right.  Jane.  We have the thing over Jane's tank right now.  Hey, Jane.  Yeah.  You see that? 
[01:35:00]  You have any guess at what it is?  We got a mic.  Oh, we're at Tabitha's tank now.  All right.  Let's go to Tabitha.  Tabitha.  Tabitha.  Yeah.  How are you doing?  The fish is alive.  Oh, my God.  What is that?  You don't know what it is?  No.  Well, give her another one.  She's got to identify it.  Oh, my God.  What do you think this is?  I don't know what it is.  What is it?  What is that?  Oh, my God. 
[01:35:30]  It's a squid.  It's a big squid.  It's a big squid.  It's about an eight-inch squid.  Yeah.  You like that?  Oh, now I'll be...  Oh, my God.  The piece of resistance.  We have the...  What we call the Popeye Surprise.  Yes.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Jesus.  Girls, wait till you get the Popeye Surprise.  Bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah.  Blah, blah.  Who's first?  Who's first? 
[01:36:00]  All right.  Wendy?  What?  Oh, my God.  Oh, God.  What's going on?  What's going on?  Wendy, you okay?  Yeah.  All right.  Here we go.  She's fighting back.  She's fighting.  She's fighting.  Put more in there.  Put more in there.  Christy is being...  Christy's tank is coming apart. 
[01:36:30]  She's breaking out of the tank.  Is she quitting?  Is she quitting?  Christy...  We just can't find out.  No, Christy's still in.  All right.  She picked me up well.  All right.  Get some more duct tape around her.  All right.  Has everybody gotten this?  No.  Over here, Andy.  Who hasn't gotten one?  These people didn't get the Popeye Surprise over there.  Popeye Surprise?  Yes.  A little more Popeye Surprise.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, God. 
[01:37:00]  Okay.  Mike that barrel.  She's not saying anything.  She's really quiet.  Talk to her.  It's on her head.  Kate, it's on your head.  No, it isn't.  Is it?  I don't even want to look.  It's on your head.  Feel your head, Kate.  No way.  What am I doing?  You know what it is? 
[01:37:30]  No.  Can you identify it?  Well, you shouldn't be able to identify it.  Usually, it's inside the fish.  Gut?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Fish guts.  And fish eyeballs.  And fish eyeballs.  Oh.  All right.  Well, maybe one of the other girls would like some.  Yeah.  Tabitha.  No.  Tabitha.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  My mom.  No.  No.  No. 
[01:38:00]  No.  Wow.  No.  No.  No.  No.  We've broken Tabitha, Anthony.  She was so...  Compare the audience from the beginning of the show.  We have broken her.  She was so nasty.  She was so rambunctious at the beginning of this.  She was fighting back and everything.  And now she's just sitting there in the fetal position.  There's eyeballs on...  Yeah.  There's eyeballs on Tabitha.  Tabitha's got the fish eyes.  Yeah.  God damn, it stinks.  It's really stinking now.  I can only imagine...  Jane.  ...like in the barrel.  Yeah.  How you doing, Jane? 
[01:38:30]  Jane?  Yeah?  You know what that is?  Um, no.  Coming in on you?  We're junk.  Can you feel it?  Yes.  Is it slimy?  Uh, yes.  It should be.  It's like Mark's junk.  It should be.  We didn't have enough fish guts for you, though, Jane.  I'm really sorry about that.  We'll have to make do, though, with this other bag.  Oh, my God.  Don't put it...  Don't put that in there.  Yeah.  Let it rip.  Let it rip, man.  It's a fish juice and everything. 
[01:39:00]  Yeah, everything.  All right, just dump it.  Dump it.  Dump it.  Right in Jane's pail.  There you go, Jane.  What is this?  Because you got a bunch of little friends with you.  Oh, my God.  All right.  Are they alive?  Sardines.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  All right.  Go nuts, guys.  How about that big one?  See that big one?  Oh, my God. 
[01:39:30]  Wendy doesn't like those.  Yeah, Wendy is...  Wendy doesn't like the little fish.  Maybe she'll like that big one.  Wendy is having a tough time with the Popeye surprise.  That big one.  Yeah, that one.  Yeah, get the biggie.  Dump that right in Wendy's tank.  Come on.  Wendy.  There you go, Wendy.  Oh, it barely fits through the hole.  Yeah, just squeeze it through.  Squish it through.  Squish it through.  Oh, my God.  It's another fish.  That was a whopper. 
[01:40:00]  There's a ton of dead sea light in the barrels now.  How about some surf and turf?  Yeah, why don't you throw that in there?  A little turf for the surf and turf.  You guys might as well finish up with the Popeye surprise.  Let it rip.  Get it all in there.  Let it rip.  Get all the Popeye surprise in all the barrels.  Equally distributed.  Oh, some clams?  Oh, my God.  Oh, God, that stinks.  Holy cow, that stinks.  Wow, the clams really smell bad. 
[01:40:30]  Oh, God, that stuff is so...  I don't know what that is.  Get it in there quick, though.  Okay.  And don't spill it anywhere.  Oh, my God.  Dude, that is the worst.  What the hell is it?  Dude, it's some kind of fish chum face.  Don't put it on her hand too much because she'll fling it.  All right.  That stuff is disgusting.  Talk to that guy.  What is it?  What is that?  This is clam chum, and it's got corn in it, and it's old, and you catch flounder with 
[01:41:00]  it during the...  What else is in it?  Fish guts?  Yeah, well, ground corn, corn pieces, and like...  Guts, Opie.  Guts.  Oh, my God.  It stinks.  I can smell it over here.  Oh, my God.  This studio smells so bad right now.  All the guys are holding their nose.  Yeah, Christie's tank is going to have to be...  Retaped.  Retaped.  Okay, look.  I think some of the stuff is pouring out the back, Rick.  It's all over the floor. 
[01:41:30]  Oh, they're just squeezing dead fish guts into the barrel now.  What the hell was that?  You don't want to know.  You don't want to know.  And at this point, I don't think we're going to make it to Saturday.  Hey, can someone fart in here to clear up the air?  It's real.  Oh, my God.  It stinks in here.  Oh, my God.  All right, who wants out?  Wendy's freaking. 
[01:42:00]  All right, go.  We found Wendy's weakness, the live fish or the big fish.  Yeah.  He's ripping the fish open.  No, he's tearing the fish in two and throwing them on top of the girls.  All right, Ann, go talk to Wendy.  I think she's ready to give in.  Let's talk to Wendy.  Get over there.  Okay, hold on.  Oh, my God.  It just stinks over here.  It just stinks so bad.  All right, yeah, put the mic in there. 
[01:42:30]  Wendy?  Yeah?  How are you doing with your new friends?  Oh, I'm having a party in here.  Are you going to stay in the barrel?  Are you feeling like backing out?  No, absolutely.  Dude, the barrel is starting to break.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Christy's barrel, O.B., we have a problem, is starting to break, and liquid is pouring out of it.  We may have to eliminate Christy from the competition.  Oh, Christy, I got you. 
[01:43:00]  She's done?  Is she done?  Give her a towel.  Is she done?  Give her a towel.  Get a picture of her.  It hatched.  Is she done?  Give her a paper towel for her face.  Wait, get a picture of Christy.  Yeah, get a picture of her.  Oh, my God.  The top just came off of her.  Oh, Jesus.  Off of her barrel.  Is she done?  No.  She says no. 
[01:43:30]  Yeah, look, look.  You know something?  I don't know.  We need a ruling.  Because is the barrel cracking?  Yeah.  The barrel is cracking on the bottom.  No, no, it's not.  No, she can't get up if she wants to stop.  All right.  Get her back down.  We're going to have to get a ruling.  Rick, get that picture, though.  People need to see what it looks like in the barrel.  We'll get, we'll get, all right.  Anthony, come on over here.  Oh, my God. 
[01:44:00]  All right, listen.  The studio reeks so freaking bad.  It's not even funny.  We're in the middle of the 55-gallon drum challenge.  Christy, who's 250 pounds, the barrel came apart.  Dude, it smells.  We thought she was quitting, but she's not.  But she looks like Al.  It smells so bad in here.  I can't even tell you.  They just dumped so much fish.  Crap in the barrels, Anthony.  Mixed with everything else we have thrown in the barrels thus far, it is really starting to reek in here. 
[01:44:30]  All right.  So Christy is still in the competition?  We made the ruling, and she's still in?  Well, it was, well, the other girls are yelling, no fair.  Yeah, but it was due to an equipment failure and not her own doing.  But if we do detect that she is doing this on purpose to get intermittent breaks, we will eliminate her from the competition.  All right.  Ladies, good news.  Paisano just came through. 
[01:45:00]  Also, you got gift certificates, guaranteed.  Yeah, try the fish.  Got gift certificates.  It's great down there.  We want to thank, also, Shrewsbury Bicycle for donating some fine stuff for us today, Anthony.  You know what I love from Paisano?  The linguine and clam sauce.  It's great.  Rick's getting sick over here in the corner.  Rick, you all right?  No, he really is getting sick.  No.  I swear to God, look at him.  Rick, you all right?  No, he's not good, man.  He's about to yak.  Make him do it.  He's about to yak.  Rick, do you got a bucket? 
[01:45:30]  Oh, my God.  He's a pasty white.  Let me see your face, Rick.  Look at his face.  Look over two seconds.  Rick, turn around.  Oh, he's sweating.  He's got a cold sweat.  What got to him?  As white as a ghost.  Rick, what got you, man?  What got him?  Mic him.  Get the mic over there.  Yeah, make him talk about it.  What got him?  Oh, he's going behind.  He's trying to crawl out the window.  Oh, no.  No, he's in really bad shape.  Dude, he's going to puke.  How bad is the smell over there now, Anthony?  Really bad?  Ladies, Rick is ready to vomit. 
[01:46:00]  Thank you.  Look at what you did to Rick again.  Get a picture of Rick for the website.  Rick, was it the break in the fish in half?  Oh, hold on, hold on.  I think it was like a freaking small black cloud of just disgusting stench.  That got all into me, and I almost lost it.  And it's like stuck in my lungs right now.  Ben, let's check on the ladies to make sure they're okay.  Yeah.  Tabitha, how are you? 
[01:46:30]  Tabitha.  Not as well as I was.  Okay.  Do you think you're going to make it?  I'm going to try.  How bad does it smell in there?  Oh, you have no idea.  All right.  All right.  Let's go to, it was all cute and fun about an hour ago, huh?  Yeah.  Jane, how does it smell?  I can't smell anymore.  No?  No.  I'd just like to launch an official protest, though.  I think we should all get our barrels open if Christy got to have hers open.  It kind of broke apart.  We made a ruling, and we're making sure it's not going to break apart again. 
[01:47:00]  All right.  All right.  She has that special barrel, which is kind of not fair, but, yeah.  All right.  Who have we got next over there?  Kate?  Kate, how are you doing?  I'm all right.  Yeah?  How's the smell?  It's okay.  I'm just sticking my nose out of the hole.  All right.  Yeah, that's a good idea.  Let's go to Wendy.  Wendy really had a problem with the fish guts.  Wendy?  Yeah?  How are you feeling now?  All right.  I don't like the fish, but, I mean, the smell is not getting to me, which is good.  It's getting to all the guys in the studio right now. 
[01:47:30]  She's not bad.  Yeah, they're a bunch of chumps.  All right.  And, Christy?  Yeah?  We thought you quit for a second there, Christy.  No, I didn't quit.  Sorry.  The bottom one collapsed.  Right.  And the top one fell off, and I had something in my eye.  All right.  Well, stop fighting it.  Don't fight anymore.  Yeah.  See, you're leaning around and stuff.  Okay.  They're duct taping their barrels done again, Anthony.  All right. 
[01:48:00]  All right.  All right.  Man, we've got to take a break.  Jeez, man.  We've got to take a break.  We'll be back.  This is a Friday favorite as we continue the 55-gallon drum challenge.  Another surprise about a half hour away, Anthony.  I'm running out of brain at this point, Anthony.  I'm a brainless buffoon.  The Opie and Anthony show.  More stupidity on the way.  1-0-2-7-W-N-E-W.  Oh, my God.  Someone's saying, if Rick vomits, have him do it in the drums. 
[01:48:30]  Anthony Bouchon.  What's the matter with your voice, though?  Nothing's wrong with my voice.  Dude, it stinks so bad in here.  I took a break all the way down the hall.  30, 40 feet from the studio, you start smelling.  Yeah.  And then you get closer and closer to the studio.  And by the time you get in here, it is just disgusting.  Yes.  Jamaican Mike has made it into the studio.  Yeah, I'm here.  Hey, Mike.  How you doing, man?  I'm doing pretty good.  Good?  I got my spear gun, man.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm going to shoot some fish today.  There's some fishing in the barrels. 
[01:49:00]  Like shooting fish in a barrel.  Yeah.  The concoction at the bottom of these barrels has got to be the most disgusting thing ever.  Oh, yeah.  It's just a soup.  We ought to boil it up.  So I guess I can't put my junk inside here.  You know, we drilled big holes on the side of the barrels, but I don't even...  You're Jamaican, though, man.  There's no way.  I don't think you're going to be able to fit.  Hey, Anthony.  Wow, the water on the bottom is deep.  Anthony, Mouchon.  Yes, Mouchon.  Listen to the difference between shaving and waxing. 
[01:49:30]  Women who wax them, smoother, more sensuous skin, I'll be.  After the honey and all the syrup and stuff we pulled...  They're exfoliating right now.  Yeah, I don't think they're going to have any hair left on their body.  Their skin will be soft, but the easier way is a Mouchon.  Mouchon, yeah.  The lovely Mouchon.  No one makes waxing easy.  Mouchon features press-on, pull-off wax strip called Mouchon 2002.  You don't have to heat it.  There's no mess.  It's easy.  Just peel, press it on, pull it off.  Your unwanted hair, gone. 
[01:50:00]  No unpleasant odors like going on in this studio, man.  This place stinks.  No chemicals to irritate your skin.  Mouchon 2000 is gentle, has botanicals in it, is hypoallergenic and removes hair completely.  Hair's slow to grow back, lighter, thinner.  Skin is softer and sexier than before, Opie.  Guys, get your ladies Mouchon 2000 today.  Check them out in their skimpiest bikini or most revealing sundress tomorrow.  Mouchon 2000, the most comfortable way to remove hair.  At home, why pay a salon?  Mouchon-ed. 
[01:50:30]  Mouchon available.  Dwayne Reed, Harman Cosmetics, Genovese Drugs and Cosmetics.  Plus, if you don't see Mouchon, ask the store manager where the wax is that you can peel hair off of your agage.  Very good.  It's Mouchon.  Mouchon.  And we'll go to the phones next, see what everyone's saying today, all right?  Stay there.  Britney Spears.  We don't play her music.  But we'd sure like to pin her legs back like a Tyson chicken.  Radio Gonzo style.  Opie and Anthony. 
[01:51:00]  1027 WNEW.  Gonzo style.  That's right, Ed.  Radio Gonzo style.  We're about 20 minutes away from the next surprise for the ladies in the barrel.  Yes.  In the barrels.  We're doing the 55-gallon drum challenge today.  The whole fish thing was just nasty.  It really, I think it affected us just as much as the girls in the barrel.  Well, Rick almost puked.  Rick did.  He was in the corner. 
[01:51:30]  I don't know if he had a bucket there or something.  Rick, did you have a bucket?  What, were you just going to puke behind the friggin' console?  I was holding it back.  He was holding it back?  Yeah, but sometimes you can't.  I thought you would have rushed for a garbage pail or something.  He was a barrel.  He was pasty white with, like, just, you know, sweat on his forehead.  Did you see Rick, like, getting ready to puke and then deciding he couldn't puke on the floor,  so he just goes over, like, one of the barrels?  It's a barrel.  Blech.  That would count, right?  Yeah, that would count.  Yeah, guys, continue dumping stuff in the barrel.  I think they just threw some chocolate syrup in there, and I'm sure you get a mic by those 
[01:52:00]  things.  And we've got to talk to Jeff Norris.  He's doing a wow sticker stop for us today.  And he was stuck in traffic.  He just arrived, so let's go to him now.  Jeff Norris, what's going on?  How we doing?  Fellows left in Toyota in New Rochelle.  Gorilla Boy.  We're out here, hanging out, giving out some stickers.  A couple women here listening to the barrels.  So they want to join the barrels.  They want to jump in there with the big girl.  They said they could handle it.  I got a girl here that looks like she's from Ethiopia.  She wants to jump in the barrel with the big girl. 
[01:52:30]  It is a good crowd.  We're having a good time.  We're having stickers, and come on down.  We're having a blast over here.  All right, if you want to get your wow stickers in time for the weekend, it's Gorilla Boy.  They're flashing the crowd.  We got flashing going on.  Very nice.  New Rochelle Toyota, 47 Cedar Street in New Rochelle, across from the Ramada Inn.  You guys will be there at least another hour, right?  Absolutely.  We're going to stay longer because of the traffic jam.  We're going to stay, hang out, so come on down.  All right, man.  Thank you, Jeff.  You got it. 
[01:53:00]  There he goes, Gorilla Boy, Anthony.  We're all over the place once again today.  Has anyone figured out how these girls are going to clean up after this?  That's not our problem.  Actually, we didn't think that far ahead.  Yeah, I remember we worked at a place up in Boston where we had showers.  Yeah.  Remember that?  Yeah, we don't know.  It was convenient.  We took the girls down, and they showered.  We'd shower with them at our house.  Yes, with a video camera.  Oh, my God.  Listen to the screen.  They're still screaming.  It's like a sneaky toy. 
[01:53:30]  All right, we'll talk to Ben and Rick and see what they've dumped in since the last time  we checked in.  A bunch of people checking in, though.  We got to go to the phones.  DK, what's going on?  Hey, how's it going, guys?  All right, man.  Listen, I'm sitting here in my apartment.  I'm listening to you guys, and I'm hearing these girls wriggling and screaming and going  up.  So I start, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop.  Next thing you know, mess everywhere.  Oh, my God.  Come on.  I kid you not.  You can't spank it.  When I play around with you.  You're spanking it to the girls screaming and laughing? 
[01:54:00]  Like a madman.  You are sick.  Are you close to the station?  No, no.  I'm in Bluefield, New Jersey.  Okay, just asking.  Thank you.  Hey, listen.  Can I say what's up to the Wentworths cricket guys?  Right on.  You just did, bro.  Thank you.  Have a great weekend.  All right, let's go to Stu.  Stu, you're next on NAW.  Hey, LNA.  What's up?  I figured out two things.  I got to let everyone know, we've just been continually, continually throwing, I can't  even talk.  I'm waiting for it to drown.  We're just throwing, we're just throwing stuff in as we go. 
[01:54:30]  You got to realize why the fish stuff didn't get him out of the barrel.  Why?  They're women.  They're used to that smell.  Oh, easy.  Really?  If you want to get him out of the barrel?  Yeah.  Something used, bong water.  Yeah.  Most repulsive smell on the planet.  Don't really have any.  That's right.  Can you ask the girls how much liquid is at the bottom of their tanks now?  Can we start with Christy?  Yeah.  No!  Hey, Christy.  Yeah?  How much liquid is at the bottom of your tank? 
[01:55:00]  Um, I can't see my toes, and I'm almost at the top of my feet.  All right.  I can't even swish it around, but it'll be a little different.  Yeah, it tells me not seeing your toes isn't something new.  Yeah, have the girls, have the girls swish, uh, swish, uh, the liquid around a little bit.  Ha ha, yeah, easy.  Easy with the cursive.  Yeah, switch the water around at the bottom of your, uh, tank.  That is, oh, it's a pool of goo.  That's just, that's just, that's just, that's just, ask, now the other girls have smaller 
[01:55:30]  barrels, so ask, uh, Wendy.  Yeah?  How much liquid is at the bottom of your barrel?  So, my ankles?  Up to your ankles?  Yeah.  And, uh, are you feeling like the fish in there and everything?  I cannot hear when I'm banging.  Uh, are you feeling the fish in there?  Yeah, they're like going between my toes.  There are so many, so many pieces of fish in these barrels, though.  Boy, you're, all right. 
[01:56:00]  I'm just screaming.  Don't worry.  Let's go to Rob.  Let's go, I'm to preach for you.  Hey, guys, how you doing?  All right, Rob.  I don't know whether or not you know this, but, uh, you may not have to, uh, worry about  showering them off, because if you, uh, if this fish was old, or if it is actually  chum, I don't know if you know this, but maggots form on fish guts and chum real quick.  Oh, yeah?  They might, they might take care of that for you.  Just clean themselves.  All right.  They'll clean themselves.  Yeah.  So you might want to inform them about that one. 
[01:56:30]  They can't see too well in these, uh, barrels, can they?  It's pretty dark.  Yeah, it's very dark.  I got to say, uh, what they are pouring in now is, uh, is that dog food?  Yes.  Yeah, they're putting dog food, creamed corn, uh, and some anchovies.  All right.  Prune juice.  Wait a minute.  No, they're just scooping the stuff that's on the top of the barrel in there, too.  Yeah, there's so much sludge on the top of the barrels, and it works up into this, like,  goopy substance. 
[01:57:00]  And then we just push it in the holes as we go along.  Hey, have any of the ladies, uh, taken a leak in the barrel yet?  Oh, look at this.  Look at this.  No?  Oh, look at this.  What is it?  What was that, Ed?  Sardines in a can with the oil.  Oh, man.  With the sardine oil and everything.  Oh, this is horrible.  Let's go to Sam.  Hey, Sam, what's up?  Hello.  How are you, Sam?  Uh, doing all right.  You guys, man, I don't know.  You guys just call it Opie and Anthony Sense Radio, because a couple weeks back, you were giving 
[01:57:30]  us a boner every friggin' week, and this week, I'm ready between the rats last week  and this.  Yeah, this would have been, like, a disgusting, uh, week.  We gotta get just back to pure, clean, uh, gash and, uh, and boobs.  Nothing wrong with that.  So what's next you got in order for these guys?  Golden showers or some guys spanking it on top of the barrel?  You never know, man.  Keep listening, all right?  Yep.  Uh, the next, uh, I'm gonna go on record and say the next, uh, surprise that we're doing  about, uh, 10-15 minutes at, yeah, we'll, we'll get at least one of the girls  out of the barrel.  Yeah, I think so, too. 
[01:58:00]  I think so, too.  It's time to thin the herd, and that's happening about 10-15 minutes.  To thin the herd.  They, they sound like they're suffering now.  Matt, what's up?  Hey, how you doing, O&A?  Great.  You guys are off the hook.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  You know.  Sound like you're having more fun than a barrel of fresh-gaffed monkeys down there.  Let me tell you, I can't, hats off to those ladies.  I cannot believe that they're still in the barrels, and you guys are still in that station.  I was out fishing last week using chump. 
[01:58:30]  Yeah.  With the ocean breeze blowing outside, and I was dry-heaving, shoveling that crap over  the side.  Oh, my God.  My stomach is just turning.  Driving down the Jersey Shore on the parkway, and my stomach is just turning.  All right.  Thank you, Matt.  Oh, man.  Let me say hi to the boys at Amtrak, would you?  You just did.  Thanks.  Thank you.  Okay, Anthony.  I think we're going to take a break, and then we're going to go for the next surprise.  Oh, that water's awful gold. 
[01:59:00]  Are we running out of stuff to put in the barrels?  Ew!  I don't think so.  No?  Okay.  Are there any listeners upstairs that brought some stuff to dump into the barrel?  Yeah, there's some guys upstairs.  Yeah?  Someone should check to see what they got.  All right.  Let them come down here.  Oh, my God.  Just taking a breather here.  All right.  Hey, Rick, we've got to play phone call of the week here as we go to break, if we can get that.  And which one would that be? 
[01:59:30]  The guy where there was dead silence.  He was talking about his wow sighting.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  We had a lot of requests for this, and this is definitely the phone call of the week.  We'll play this.  We'll take a break, and when we get back, it's going to get very interesting.  Yeah, I think, like you said, the herd will be thinned.  It's very, very interesting.  If you turn off the radio now, you're crazy, okay?  Oh, God, I can't.  I'm imagining it, and I'm freaking out.  All right, here it is.  Phone call of the week.  We'll be back.  Steve, what's going on today?  How are you doing?  I've got a wow story for you.  Okay. 
[02:00:00]  Saturday, I was at this huge picnic, and there was a lot of beer flowing, so we were all having a good time.  And so I come walking by the bathrooms where they all are, and a couple of my friends are there, and they say,  Come here.  Come over here.  And I say, What's going on?  He says, There's a girl inside.  She's lying to everybody.  I'm like, Get out of here.  So I'm standing there.  I said, Don't waste my time.  I said, I've got a lot of things to do.  I'm running around.  So this girl comes out.  She is so hammered.  She can barely stand.  So my friend's standing there, and he goes, All right, let me see him.  And she's like, See what?  He goes, Come on, let me see him. 
[02:00:30]  And she goes, No, no, no way.  Oh, my God.  So all of a sudden, he says, Come on, just show everybody.  She just picks her shirt up.  I mean, and it's in the middle of a park.  There's like 400 people.  Georgia!  Walking around, lifting her shirt up.  I mean, just throwing her, you know, you know what?  It's all over the place.  So these guys take her over.  Georgia!  They got a hose going, and they choke her all down.  Georgia!  They need her to take her bikini off.  And put her t-shirt on. 
[02:01:00]  So it's here for a while to everybody.  They got her so drunk, and they just got her walking through the park,  just lifting her shirt up in front of everybody.  So I figure you guys would appreciate that.  Hello.  Okay, terrific.  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?

Pop the top.  Get a picture.  Get a picture of Kate.  Kate?  Come on.  Come on out, Kate.  Come on out, Kate.  Pop the top here.  Pop that top.  Kate is out.  Let's hop it.  All right.  Kate is out.  Kate, we're letting you out.  And here goes the lid.  Here comes Kate. 
[02:46:00]  Give her a hand.  Kate.  Oh, my God.  I'm like cramped.  No, that was...  I saw the worms above me or something.  Oh, no, no.  All right, guys.  You know what you do?  Oh, no, no, no.  Guys, before she gets anywhere out of that bucket, maybe dump some water over her head or something.  Yeah, clean her up a little bit.  Clean her up.  Well, let's talk to Kate.  First of all, let's hear her for Kate.  Yeah, Kate.  I'd love to be gone to the end of the day.  I'd expect, right?  I really expected you to be gone a lot sooner. 
[02:46:30]  Do you guys have worms on your head?  Forget that.  Yeah.  All right.  Wow.  See, really.  And, Kate, you will get some fabulous parting gifts.  No.  Don't worry.  Incredible.  That's okay.  I'm like, a couple hundred dollars.  I'm like, uh-uh.  You're going to get all sorts of great stuff.  Trust me.  So...  Well, you've just increased the bounty for the other girls.  They will divvy up your share of the $2,500.  Instead of four girls for $2,500, what's that? 
[02:47:00]  Yeah, so that adds in another $625 each, about, if they last...  What?  Oh, yeah.  Totally.  So...  It's like a hundred and a quarter extra.  Well, let's interview Kate.  Can she hear us?  What?  Ben's cursing.  All right, listen.  All right, listen, listen.  So, Kate, how was it in the barrel?  It wasn't too bad until you guys started throwing in, like, the live stuff. 
[02:47:30]  I looked up from the hole.  Yeah.  And I just saw, like, little...  Living creatures.  Like, little, like...  Oh, my God.  What?  Little, like, words.  Why don't you get her hair, too?  That's how I got out.  Get some water in her hair.  Don't worry.  Yeah, brush that back.  My eyes shut the whole time.  Keep the water coming, and...  All right.  She'll be fine.  And they're a valiant effort.  They're cleaning off Kate, the first one to get out of the barrel.  Yeah, that would have, uh...  I don't know.  That would have gotten anybody. 
[02:48:00]  Very good.  Very good.  Oh, she's freaking out.  She's freaking out.  She's just standing in her barrel, Anthony, as they clean her off.  The smell is a hell of a lot worse now that that barrel's been opened up, by the way.  Oh, my God.  Let's go to the phones real fast here.  Karen, what's going on?  I just wanted to thank God I knew you guys well enough not to actually get in the drum.  This is the best decision I ever made.  Yeah, you were...  I cannot believe what you're putting in those drums.  Yeah, you were...  You were going to be one of the contestants, huh? 
[02:48:30]  I was actually going to...  I talked to Rick yesterday, and I said, you know, I heard the word chum, and that was it.  All right.  That's all I had to hear, and I got to give a hand to those girls.  I can't believe they're still in the bow.  Definitely.  Let's hear it for the girls.  I went to West an hour ago.  All right.  Thank you, Karen.  Still in.  Let's go to Rich on line seven.  Rich, what's up?  Yo, what's going on?  Hey.  Hey, you're dumping all kinds of stuff on that, man.  Yeah.  Yo, you're going to lose $2,500.  You know that, right?  Oh, yeah.  We know that.  We know it.  Chris, you ain't getting out.  That's my ex-wife.  Oh, really?  Yeah, she ain't getting out. 
[02:49:00]  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on.  I got it.  Sorry.  Sorry.  No cursing.  All right, man.  Thank you.  I know.  Thank you.  All right, Ant, let's take a break.  Please.  I got to make another run.  We'll take a break.  The fuck guys are not done.  That's all I can say.  Okay.  What was the first ones you guys put in?  Let me...  First, we put in crickets.  Okay.  Yeah, yeah.  And those are the ones that they were saying hurt.  They're just walking on them. 
[02:49:30]  Yeah, because they're walking and they got little prickly feet.  Yes.  And then there were...  And then we had the wax worms, which are maggots that turn into moths.  Right.  And then...  Then we had the mule worms, which are little maggots that turn into beetles.  Okay, and that's all.  And you have one more.  So far.  One more, right?  No, we have two more.  Okay, well, we won't talk about those yet.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  Let me just say this.  You are very lucky you left when you did.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  You should not be...  Kate, you should not be disappointed.  Trust me. 
[02:50:00]  Okay.  All right?  And we're going to...  And you know something?  As a prize, you can get to help torture the other girls.  Okay.  Yeah, that's fair.  And Shrewsbury Bikes just called, and they want to take care of all our contestants, not  just the eventual winner.

Anthony, sharper image, the Razor Rollerboard scooter.  Yeah, you can see how pissed I got before when we took a walk to the office and you had  your Razor Rollerboard scooter and I couldn't find one?  You had to huff it back to the studio.  But I walked back to the studio thinking, okay, at least I could ride a Razorboard scooter 
[02:52:30]  back to the studio from the office.  There wasn't one back there either.  No.  Who's heisting the Razor Rollerboard scooters?  Everyone.  Where?  Because everyone wants them, Anthony.

[02:54:30]  Breaking development.  Breaking development in the game.  It looks like Christy.  Christy, what's up?  What's up?  All right, she just said, get me the F out.  Get her out.  Get her out.  Pull her out.  Get her out.  It's over, Johnny.  It's over.  It's over.  Christy, we're getting you out.  Our second contestant to drop out.  The barrel's coming up.  Oh, God.  Christy.  Get some water on her.  Get her some water on her.  Get her some water to drink.  Don't tip that barrel over.  She has bailed out, Anthony. 
[02:55:00]  She's had it.  She didn't even make it to the next challenge.  Wow.  Let's hear it for Christy.  My God.  Oh, my good God.  All right, she's catching her breath, Ant.  She just couldn't take it anymore.  Yeah.  They didn't even dump anything on her.  I guess just being cooped up in there during the break was enough.  Let her catch her breath.  We'll talk to her in a second here.  I just want to remind people that a couple of our winners today will receive a pair of 
[02:55:30]  tickets to the Tattoo the Earth Tour, Anthony, featuring Metallica, Slayer, Slipknot,  Coal Chamber, Seven Dust, and more at Giant Stadium on Thursday, July 20th.  It's her outlets.  Did she curse in the background?  I don't know.  Close enough.  John will get it if she did.  I don't think so.  Just in case she cursed, you know, tickets go on sale tomorrow morning at 9 a.m.  through Ticketmaster Outlets for the Tattoo the Earth Tour, featuring Metallica, Slayer, 
[02:56:00]  Slipknot, Coal Chamber, Seven Dust, and more at Giant Stadium on Thursday, July 20th.  What's going on?  It's a cycle mark.  Look, it's a cycle mark.  All right.  Give Christy that gives you.  No, she's really pissed right now.  Christy.  Christy.  Now, without cursing, please.  Sorry.  What made you decide that you finally had had it?  The things between my toes and everything hurting my feet. 
[02:56:30]  Yeah?  Yeah.  I just, I don't think I had enough circulation.  I just couldn't breathe anymore.  Yeah.  Yeah, that'll do it.  It's pretty cramped, even though we gave you the big green one.  Yeah.  It was still a little cramped.  And then the disgusting things between your toes and stuff.  Yeah.  What was the sickest thing that we dumped in the barrel today?  Well, the crickets hurt.  They didn't hurt.  They weren't biting.  They were just crawling on you.  No, it was just them crawling on me hurt.  Yeah, they got those little prickly.  And, uh, what kind of worms were those? 
[02:57:00]  Cheryl is foul.  I got that.  Get a picture of that for the website.  I got one.  Where's Rick?  Did he pass out on us?  Look, there's a fish.  Diarrhea.  There's a fish.  All right, we're getting more pictures for the website.  www.dw.com has the pictures of this show.  And I'll tell you something.  Justin, you think the glamorous life of an intern on the radio show? 
[02:57:30]  They got to deal with this fluid after this is over with.  I don't know what the hell you guys are going to do with this stuff.  I don't know.  First of all, the solid matter is going to have to be scooped out and thrown into a bag.  And the rest is going to have to go down the bowl.  The window?  Throw it out the window.  I will take care of it.  Yeah.  All right.  Can I step out?  Yeah, Christy.  Yeah, make sure she...  Are you regretting going into the barrel, Christy?  Don't let her trod any fish juice on the carpet. 
[02:58:00]  Are you regretting going into the barrel today?  No, I'm not regretting it.  No?  You need a couple more air holes, that's all.  You do get some fine parting gifts.  No, we're going to completely take care of the ladies.  Our listeners are calling up like crazy.  Everyone feels so bad for you ladies.  They're coming to the table with stuff.  Ernie did the math for us.  Now we're down to $833 each for the finalists.  Is it?  What?  $833?  Yeah, that makes sense.  Okay.  Now it's $833 each. 
[02:58:30]  Who's paying for the therapy?  How do the other girls feel?  We haven't even spoken with them in quite a while.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Let's go to the phones for a second here.  Is Christy...  No, I'm not going to shoot.  I just need to sit down.  All right.  Teresa, what's going on?  I want to know who's going to pay for these girls to have therapy afterwards.  Yeah, the screaming of the last segment really got to me.  Are you bugs on them?  Oh, that's a sin.  These girls are going to have to go to serious psychological help.  Yeah.  I hope you guys are going to pick up the bill.  They'll be all right.  I don't think so.  They're all smiling. 
[02:59:00]  Well, the two that have made it out of the barrels, they're smiling, so...  Oh, God.  All right.  You guys are gross.  All right.  Thank you.  Bye.  Bye.  Get some flattering pictures of her.  Jesus.  Elisa, what's up?  All right, guys.  All right.  How much did she say she weighed?  Christy?  Are you going to make fun of her?  She just spent three hours in a barrel of crap.  Well, that deserves making fun of anyway.  She weighs too fitty. 
[02:59:30]  That is not possible.  I logged on to the website.  I'm 200, and I'm the size of her thighs.  Maybe have boobs weight.  No, you know, you probably just think so.  You're 200.  You should be talking.  Oh, yes, Drew.  I have a goddamn...  She has the guts to be here.  That's all.  That's right.  But what did you cover her with in that thing?  She had the big barrel.  The green thing?  The big green barrel was Christy's.  Do 200-pound people really make fun of people that are over 200 pounds?  Oh, yeah.  Really? 
[03:00:00]  Yeah.  So you think you're like a twig compared to Christy?  Well, there's no...  She's definitely lying about that.  You're 200 pounds.  You look like a line from her.  You're 200 pounds.  Listen, you're 200 pounds.  And that probably means you're two in a quad.  So what are you calling up to make fun of someone's weight for?  Hey, you've been doing it the whole show.  Yeah, but you...  You're 200.  I'm about 165.  I mean, I can understand if you're a twiggy or a supermodel calling up and making fun. 
[03:00:30]  Even then, it's a bit much.  But you're 200 pounds.  Put the phone down and grab a carrot.  Come on.  All right, Alyssa.  You guys suck.  Thank you.  Yeah, I don't know where that's coming from.  I said, it's amazing.  Any final words, Christy, before you get cleaned up?  Oh, that's slide onto the floor. 
[03:01:00]  Yeah, go clean her feet off so she can walk and then go into the bathroom and take a little sponge bath or something.  Whatever you need.  All right, get her out of here so we can continue the competition.  No offense, but baby, you stink.  No, as soon as she gets cleaned up, come on back into the studio so we can talk to you.  Kate's getting cleaned up.  She bailed.  And there goes Christy, our second contestant that dropped out.  Come on, let's hear it for her.  All right, now we have three remaining girls in the barrels, and I would love to hear from them. 
[03:01:30]  Yes, let's go to the, who's got the microphone?  All right, Ben's laughing.  All right, who you got in there?  Tabitha's barrel?  Tabitha?  Hey.  How are you doing?  Not well.  Not well.  Two girls have dropped out, which increases your prize money now to $833 if the three of you remain to the end.  It doesn't sound like so much anymore.  It really doesn't, does it?  Not really. 
[03:02:00]  But, hey, it's better than the $500 if all of you would have stayed.  There's a lot of bugging in here, Dan.  Oh, no.  There really is.  Yeah, there really is.  We understand.  All right, let's talk to Jane.  Jane?  Jane?  Oh, my God.  Jane?  Yes.  Are you okay?  I'm hanging in.  Now, two girls have dropped out.  Are you even considering dropping out at this point?  No, now that the odds have gotten better, I have a second win. 
[03:02:30]  Has it gone through your head to drop out?  No.  Not even gone through your head?  No.  What about Tabitha?  I didn't ask her that.  Tabitha, did it at any point go through your head to drop out yet?  Yes, since, like, 2.30.  All right.  And, of course, Wendy.  Let's put the mic there.  Wendy?  Yeah?  Have you considered dropping out?  Yeah.  Yeah?  Are you thinking about it now?  No.  No. 
[03:03:00]  Before the bugs, yeah.  But after, I don't know, I'm just really not focusing right now and looking down.  You found a new strength?  Yeah.  And the things that, like, the goop and the fish eyes and guts squishing through your toes,  and you know that your butt is, like, sitting in fish guts, that doesn't bother you?  Well, my butt's just numb right now, so it doesn't even matter.  Yeah, so fish could swim right in there and you wouldn't even know.  All right.  Oh, boy.  Okay, but you're in it, huh? 
[03:03:30]  Yeah.  All right.  Well, let's continue the challenge, Anthony.  Are the guys just about ready over there?  Ryan, what's going on?  Yeah, it's Brian.  How's it going?  Ryan, what's up?  Two things.  First of all, I've got to say, these girls make the contestants on Survivors look like  a bunch of wimps.  Yeah, absolutely.  I think this blows away anything they're doing on that show.  Eating larvae and stuff, no big deal.  These girls, guys, tell you, they take it.  They take it.  I've got to give them credit. 
[03:04:00]  Oh, without a doubt.  They're going to be heroes at our next road show.  And also, the second thing is, who's got to come into that studio and broadcast after  you guys?  Yeah, I know.  Thank God it's on tape.  Earl's got to run the board, but then Ron and Fez are going to be smelling this.  Yeah, Ron and Fez are going to be pissed off, man.  Something tells me it's unlike anything Fez has ever smelled in his life.  Maybe not.  All right, Brian.  And Yambag checking in, saying they'll never get the smell out of those fish.  That old gag. 
[03:04:30]  All right, let's move on to the next segment here.  Are the guys ready?  Sure.  Three girls left.  The insects really chased away the other two girls.  I think that was the bottom line.  They were really screaming.  What's your names, by the way?  Jason and Gary from Wetworks and Critters Animal Shows, www.greenfish.net.  Nice.  Now, the stuff that made the other two girls run away, these other three didn't get yet. 
[03:05:00]  So, I think we should continue with that.  Okay.  Oh, remember that?  Yeah, we didn't even get to them before they called it quits.  All right, who is this?  We're going to Wendy.  Wendy?  Back to the street.  I can't take the screaming anymore.  Isn't that horrible?  It really is.  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  It puts the lotion on! 
[03:05:30]  Ah!  Ah!  Oh, listen to her.  That's awful.  Oh, my God.  That is a horrifying scream, isn't it?  Yeah, I don't like that scream.  Wendy?  Wendy, you okay?  Oh, yeah.  You're going to stick it out?  You can pop out any time you want.  I'm sticking with it.  Okay.  All right.  All right, let's move on. 
[03:06:00]  Who's next?  Jane.  Now, girls?  Who?  Okay.  Who's next?  Jane.  Okay, Jane?  Jane?  Jane?  Jane?  Jane?  Jane?  Jane?  Jane?  Jane?  Jane?  Jane?  Jane?  Jane?  Jane?  Jane?  Jane?  Jane?  Jane?  Jane?  Jane?  Jane?  Jane?  How's she doing?  Jane?  Jane?  How you doing? 
[03:06:30]  No.  She doesn't want to...  No, no.  No.  No.  No.  If any girls want to get out, you just say the word.  Jane?  Jane?  Jane?  Jane?  How's she feel?  How you feeling, Jane?  I'm so good.  She's insane.  She's gone insane, Opie.  She's just giggling to herself.  It rubs the lotion on its skin.  It does this whenever it's told.  Jane, you okay?  Yeah, yeah.  All right. 
[03:07:00]  All right, she made it through that.  And, of course, the lovely Tabitha.  Tabitha, do you know what's coming in here?  No.  Have you heard the...  Oh, God, in my head.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Tabitha.  Yeah?  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  You can leave any time you want. 
[03:07:30]  Say the word.  We'll pop the top, and you're out.  I can't.  Oh, my God.  Are you going to stick it out?  No.  What do you want to do?  I'm going to stay.  You're going to stay.  Hey, come over here and talk for a second.  All right.  I'm consulting.  The girls are on our side, obviously.  The screams, the moaning.  One can only imagine this is exactly what it sounds like right before they are chopped into a quarters 
[03:08:00]  and buried somewhere along a long highway upstate.  All right.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  No.  Okay.  Here is where we really separate the champions from the chumps.  Here it is.  This is it.  This is the ultimate.  Oh, no.  Okay.  Girls.  Girls.  Wait. 
[03:08:30]  You've got to do it all at the same time.  All at the same time.  All the girls at the same time?  Yeah.  Yeah, that's a good idea.  Okay.  Okay.  Everybody.  No one else is going to do it.  Divvy them up.  Yeah.  And that's a little clue, girls.  None of the guys even want to touch it.  Divvy them up.  Divvy them up.  Divvy them up.  And then let them rip on three.  And remember, girls, you want out, just say, let me out. 
[03:09:00]  What is that?  Is that something making noise?  That isn't somebody doing that into a mic?  No.  Listen, listen, listen.  Oh, my God.  Holy cow.  No.  No.  No.  Remember, girls, just yell.  Wait.  I'm going to whisper to the audience.  Whisper to the mic.  Roaches.  They're hissing, hissing roaches.  They're huge, like the ones you see on Indiana Jones. 
[03:09:30]  Oh, my God.  That's horrible.  Oh, no.  It's horrible.  Oh, my God.  I can't take it.  I give up.  I give up. 
[03:10:00]  It rubs the lotion.  It rubs the lotion on its skin or else it can.  Oh, my God.  What is she doing?  She's hyperventilating.  Okay.  Anyone want out?  You want to leave?  All right.  Listen.  Wendy, do you wish to leave?  No.  Oh, my God.  No.  Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.  Wendy, how are you?  Huh?  Oh, she's horrified. 
[03:10:30]  You all right?  I can't even talk right now.  Go to someone else.  All right.  Let's go to Jane.  Jane?  Jane?  Yeah.  Jane's fine.  Well, see, the merciful thing is my goggles are so far, and I don't even know what that  was.  Oh, good.  Okay.  And Tabitha.  And Tabitha.  I just want to know what that was.  Oh, my God.  That's even more horrible.  They don't even know what it is. 
[03:11:00]  Oh.  Hissing cockroaches.  Don't.  Please don't tell us.  Yeah, I don't want to know anything.  Don't tell us until we get out.  Please.  Really?  Really.  Like, don't tell us.  Okay.  Don't tell them that they're...  You got to tell them.  Listen to the noise they make.  Go ahead.  Listen to the noise they make.  Rick didn't even want to touch it.  No. 
[03:11:30]  All right.  I'm over here now.  I'm a hissing cockroach.  Thanks, guys.  That helps.  All right.  You're going to her.  No, no, no.  No, please, please, please, please.  Hey.  Did you ever see the movie Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom?  Look up.  No, no, no.  No, no, no, no, no. 
[03:12:00]  They made it through that.  If you ever saw Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom when they're walking through the caves  and those huge bugs are on the wall and they're hissing, that's what they are.  And they're in the barrels with the girls now.  In the dark barrels.  All right, Anthony.  They made it through everything we had.  That's it.  You know something?  Ladies?  Ladies.  Are you listening?  Yes.  Is everyone still in? 
[03:12:30]  Yes.  All three still in?  Look.  All right.  You know something?  We're going to give it to you.  We're going to give it to you.  They've gone the distance.  They've taken everything we've had to give.  We have nothing left.  To have them in there for another half hour or so, why don't we let them out?  We'll talk to them.  You guys will be splitting.  No, Rick.  Don't look disappointed.  Then we'll hack them up and get them with spade shovels.  You guys, you're going to split the cash. 
[03:13:00]  You're going to get all sorts of other stuff together.  We've got plenty of prizes and cash.  Because at this point, I mean, we have nothing else to throw at you.  It's just going to be 40 minutes of you guys just sitting in that muck.  Unfortunately, you do have to sit in there for the break.  What do you want to do, Ant?  No, we can let them out.  I'm kidding.  Well, make sure everyone's cool with this.  Yeah.  Are all the contestants cool with this?  Tabitha.  Tabitha.  Are you cool with this?  With what?  Of course.  We're letting them out.  If they let you out now and you three split it. 
[03:13:30]  Oh, yeah.  Totally.  No problem.  All right.  How about Jane?  I'm totally cool with that.  I just want to say you guys are the greatest.  Oh, wow.  Look at that.  I think she wants to stay in there.  I think we've driven her completely insane is what it is.  And Wendy.  Yeah.  You're totally cool with splitting the $2,500 with the other two ladies?  Yeah.  All right.  Then we got our winners, Anthony.  It's a three-way tie.  You crazy bitches.  Why don't we let them out right now?  Yeah.  Let's do that.  Pop the lid. 
[03:14:00]  Pop them one at a time.  Get Wendy out first because she's the one freaking hot.  She was absolutely insanely hysterical.  Get pictures of the girls as they pop up.  They survived the hissing cockroaches, Anthony.  Wait till they see what these things look like and hear them.  Get Wendy out.  Get her out.  Lift her up.  Oh, Wendy.  How you doing?  Oh, God.  Oh, she shook her head like a dog and got everybody.  Hey, Rick, get out of the way.  I got to get a look.  What happened to you? 
[03:14:30]  Are you okay, Wendy?  Don't tip it over.  Whatever you do.  Yeah, don't tip the barrel over.  Here, put the mic in front of her face.  She's freaking out.  Wendy, you all right?  Wendy, you okay?  Hold on.  Get a mic on Wendy.  Wendy's firm breasts heaving from her excitement, Opie.  Yeah, she's going up and down.  She's really losing it.  She's going to be okay, though.  She's already relaxing.  Get a mic on Wendy so we can talk to her.  Wendy, how are you feeling?  A lot better.  A lot better? 
[03:15:00]  A lot better.  I just started flipping out when you started saying cockroaches.  That's it.  Oh, they aren't the run-of-the-mill cockroaches like you see in the house.  Hey, Rick, you got a picture of her?  Oh, yeah.  All right, because we want the before and after pictures.  They're hilarious.  All right, let's get the other girls out.  There's no reason they should be so...  Oh, my God.  That's right.  We forgot.  Look at Tabitha's finger was poking up through a hole like,  Hello, I'm over here now.  I'm over here now, right.  Biggaloo, biggaloo, biggaloo, biggaloo, biggaloo, biggaloo.  I'm over here now.  All right, let's get Jane out of the barrel. 
[03:15:30]  The 55-gallon drum challenge, Anthony.  Another bit that will be ripped off by Jackson.  Here comes Jane.  We have a microphone over here.  Jane, if you could slowly stand up.  I don't think I can.  No one wants to help you, believe me.  You're a mess.  Here she comes out of the barrel, Anthony.  Easing up.  Come on, guys.  Step to this side.  Wow.  Yeah, step to the side. 
[03:16:00]  Let's see what she looks like.  I can't straighten my knees.  All right, she's going to need a moment because she's cramped.  She can't straighten her knees.  No, she's cramped.  Get Tabitha.  Oh, Tabitha, yeah.  Look at her.  Ben, get out of the way.  Tabitha's trying to poke her finger up.  Jane, how do you feel?  Jane, how do you feel?  Very stiff.  Very stiff right now, okay?  Yeah, so are we.  There she goes, trying to get up.  Tabitha.  Hey, Tabitha. 
[03:16:30]  How you doing?  Let's see.  Pretty good.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Tabitha, look at all over her.  Oh, you're a mess.  Poor Tabitha.  Oh, she can't get out.  Wendy's trying to get out.  Don't tip that bucket over whatever you do.  Wendy is out of the barrel officially.  There she goes.  She's much more at ease.  Yes.  All the girls out of the barrels. 
[03:17:00]  They're washing off, Anthony.  There was no way you were giving up, huh?  Any of you girls?  Those bugs, those bugs really freaked you out, but you weren't going to cave in.  The bugs were pretty freaking bad.  Yeah.  Yeah, they were hissing cockroaches.  Girls, if you take a look at these.  Oh.  Oh, my God.  Is she okay?  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Wendy just slipped on some fish guts. 
[03:17:30]  Are you all right, Wendy?  All right.  Take her.  Someone watch her.  Make sure she doesn't fall.  Sit down.  She's been in, like, she can't stand up.  No, she's all right.  Yeah, look at her.  She's okay.  My legs aren't stable yet.  Yeah, her knees are all shaky.  Yeah.  She went right on her hands.  Oh, my God.  You know what she called?  Kevin had the lingerie on, and it just doesn't look the same.  No.  Something.  Boy, what a different look.  What a different look do you have now? 
[03:18:00]  All right, guys.  Get these girls some towels and a lot of water, and then, uh...  All right.  There's not much going on here.  Let's take a break.  Let the girls get their breath.  All right.  And we'll talk to all the ladies next, okay?  All right.  You guys, let's hear it for the ladies.  Come on.  It's kind of like a car wreck on the highway.  You're going to have to, you know, turn this in to see what the hell these idiots are doing next.  O.P. and Anthony.  We refuse to be responsible.  We refuse to be responsible. 
[03:18:30]  1-0-2-7-0-W-N-E-W.  Ah, Anthony, time out in New York.  The obsessive guy to impulsive entertainment.  The weekend upon us.  I want to thank the NYPD for coming down with some stuff they usually throw on puke and stuff.  No, this is what they use when they find people dead for like a month, and they're all bloated, and the place stinks.  This is what they use.  And I got to tell you, it smells great in here.  What is it?  Oh, they don't want to be on the air.  That's cool. 
[03:19:00]  But this stuff is clearing out the smell.  Odor control crystals.  Odor control crystals.  Odor control crystals.  Can you smoke it, officer?  Well, thank you, man.  That rocked.  Good.  That was killing me.  Thank you, thank you, thank you.  Yeah, time out in New York.  The obsessive guy to impulsive entertainment.  Yeah, you want to find something to do in the city, you pick up time out in New York on any newsstand.  Yeah, if you're not going to be spending the weekend in a barrel, get out there and enjoy yourselves.  Thank you.  A little tie-in to the air.  That's very good, O.P. 
[03:19:30]  They taught me that in radio school to kind of seg into it.  Yeah, little segues.  Don't miss this week's issue of Time Out in New York, highlighting everything you need to know to survive the perils of summer.  I was reading through this.  It's pretty cool.  They go over, in a funny way, funny and creative way, bee stings and mosquito bites and food poisoning.  Anything you need to protect yourself from the perils of summer.  They are so lucky they got out of the barrels.  The yellow jackets were next.  Yes.  Killer bees.  Africanized bees.  Do you have insectophobia? 
[03:20:00]  I guess the girls do now.  We were going to dump some, the AIDS virus.  Yeah, AIDS virus, riding on the backs of diamondback rattlers.  That was next.  If you don't have insectophobia, you will after you check out this informative and funny guides of killer bees, mosquito snarfing fishes, and much more in Time Out, New York.  For a subscription, give them a call, 1-888-GET-T-O-N-Y, Time Out, New York, the obsessive guide to impulsive entertainment.  Get it and get it.  The phone's just exploding.  We'll go to them next. 
[03:20:30]  Stay there.  Wow.  And Anthony.  God damn genius.  1027.  W.A.W.  Yeah, we are geniuses, aren't we, Ed?  You know what's funny?  Over here where I am, because the cops put down those odor crystal things, it smells all minty fresh, and the outside smells okay, too.  But when you get right near the barrels, it smells like a double mint fish gum.  You know, I don't know if they want to put out that flavor. 
[03:21:00]  Yeah.  But I would say no.  We've got to get the ladies back into the studio before we get out of here in 15 minutes.  When they went walking out of the studio towards wherever they're going to wash up, all the guys were looking.  Now, remember how they were looking at a couple of the girls on the way in?  Yeah.  Like Tabitha, very attractive.  She had her perky little braids out of the side of her head, all blonde, very Heidi-like.  And she walked in, and everyone's like, oh, look, she's cute.  When she came through here, it was like she had the bubonic plague. 
[03:21:30]  Guys are just shunning.  They were, like, turning away.  It opened up, yeah, like the Red Sea.  The crowd parted.  They walked through.  What a different look.  Oh, boy.  A couple hours in a barrel, we'll give you.  What a day.  We've got a ton of pictures at WNAW.com.  All the pictures will be up.  I think we're up to 150 or so.  Let's go to Ray.  Ray, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  How are you?  You guys are sick.  Thanks.  All right, so anyway, I've been telling people about your show for about a while now.  I tell my friend Mike, he's at work. 
[03:22:00]  He's listening to the show, looking on the web, looking at your pictures.  Mm-hmm.  He yaks.  He walks.  He couldn't make it to the bathroom.  He starts dry heaving in front of his boss.  Dude, how do those girls do it?  Dude, I just looked at the pictures in the back.  It's like you can't even, like, help not imagining yourself in that position.  It's sound.  Oh, oh, oh.  Picture 150.  All right, hold on.  Go to picture 150.  Oh, let me check it out.  150.  Now everyone's going to 150.  Of course.  Hold on.  I see fish eyeballs. 
[03:22:30]  Oh, man.  Oh, my God.  The site's just getting slammed.  Oh, my God.  The site's so slow now.  WNAW.com.  Unbelievable pictures to be seen by everyone.  Hold on.  All right.  150.  Yeah, it's not loading.  It's just getting slammed.  It's not coming up.  All right.  Thank you, Ray.  Thank you.  All right.  That was the tomato juice really holding through.  Oh, there it is.  The whole thing.  You're giving the color. 
[03:23:00]  Melissa, what's up?  I just have to give those girls a lot of credit.  I am on my ride home, and you are throwing the bugs in the vows.  I am screaming on the ride home.  You are screaming, and you are in your car.  I'm screaming like a lunatic.  Yeah, it was.  I give those girls a lot of credit.  All right, Melissa.  Thank you.  Yeah, thank you.  It was great.  Oh, my God.  What picture? 
[03:23:30]  What picture?  141.  141.  141.  Oh.  Oh.  Let me see.  Okay.  There's worms on her legs.  There's worms on her legs.  You've got to go.  There are 150 pictures up so far.  More to come.  Yeah.  And every one of them, and every one of them is disgusting.  Just imagine what that smelled like, too.  Richard, what's going on?  Hey, ONA. 
[03:24:00]  Hey.  How can I thank you?  How can we thank you for what you do for us?  Oh, yeah.  It's an award-winning radio.  No, we thank you guys.  It's a team effort here.  You guys just gave us really good ratings today, by the way, something we haven't even brought  up, but, yeah.  I'm going to get one of those books so I can, like, check it off, like, large block thing.  But anyway, I just want to ask you, you know, I know syndication is important, but we need  TV, you know, like, just put a camera in the studio, a five-hour block, you know, pay-per-view, 
[03:24:30]  whatever it needs to be, so no blue dots, no beeping on the language.  Oh, no.  You need it.  There's a few guys.  You need it.  There's a few guys in this town already doing great TV for everyone, so.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I mean, talk to your agent or whatever.  You've got to make that happen.  You need that.  You know, not just pictures.  Live.  All right, Richard.  Yeah, we'll approach them with TV, I'll think, because they're so happy with our radio show.  So, I can tell you this, we got video clips that will go up on foundrymusic.com when  we get that stuff to Steve, but if you want to, thank you, Richard, I've got to hang up 
[03:25:00]  because we've got to go to other people, but if you want to just check out, you know, the  pictures, they're at www.com as we speak, and we're checking them out and just getting  freaked out, man.  Let's go to Ed online, too.  Ed, you're next on NAW.  Hey, you guys, you guys are sick.  I feel like I should be arrested for just listening to that.  You know, he's right, because when those girls were screaming, I felt like we were really  committing some type of crime.  Yeah, that was...  It was really bad, because they're screaming, and you could tell they were actually horrified  by what was going on.  And I want to tell everyone once again that you were hearing were the cockroaches. 
[03:25:30]  It wasn't Ant and I making any noises.  No, that was a sound made by a huge bug that had to be, like, much bigger than...  I would say it was like putting four of your thumbs together.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, two and two, like?  Yeah.  Yeah, without a doubt.  And it was hissing.  Yeah.  Hissing.  Hissing.  Bugs.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Falling in in a dark, smelly barrel that had...  Full of guts and liquid and disgusting crap. 
[03:26:00]  Chum.  Chum.  Bernie, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  Listen, I know you got a couple of New York's finest there.  Yeah.  I learned today that you had fibroids in there, tougher than all those punks in Central Park.  Yeah, without a doubt.  These girls wouldn't put it up with anything in that park.  They'd kick their ass.  You're damn right.  Especially Christy.  Yeah.  You would've ate him.  All right, Bernie.  Thank you.  All right.  What picture, man?  What picture?  Okay, hold on.  Let me see which one it is.  Uh, Sonny, what's going on?  Picture 88.  Hey, how you doing? 
[03:26:30]  Picture 88.  88.  Let's go to 88 and enjoy it together here.  Hold on.  Hold on, Sonny.  88.  80.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  It's like some kind of bizarre water ride.  It looks like she's in the lead car on some bizarre water ride.  It looks like she's popping out of her mama.  Sonny, what's going on?  Sonny.  How you doing?  All right.  All right.  Listen, these girls, these girls have got the most foot spread. 
[03:27:00]  Everybody I've ever heard, anything I've ever heard about, and you guys are crazy.  I've got to tell you, I'd like to take these three girls to the best restaurant in Manhattan,  a fancy wife, whatever restaurant they want to go to, they've got it, they've earned it.  I'm going to be honest.  I don't think we have enough prizes for these ladies.  We're going to have to take some of you guys up on the stuff you want to give them, because  it was unbelievable.  There was one point, I've got to say, when we were going from barrel to barrel and everyone  was really, really quiet and they weren't talking anymore, for a moment, I was really  scared that Wendy completely passed out. 
[03:27:30]  Yeah, I thought she did.  And I was just praying to hear her voice so I could breathe a sigh of relief and go, okay,  great.  No one has passed out on us.  I really did think she passed out.  All right, Sonny.  We'll figure all this out on Monday, so give us a call on Monday, all right?  Give you a call on Monday?  Yeah, because it's just a crazy scene in here.  There's no way we're going to be able to keep track of the stuff you guys want to give the  ladies.  All right?  All right, not a problem.  You have a nice weekend.  Girls, again, great job.  And you guys, just keep up the good work.  You're the best.  All right, thank you.  Bye.  Let's go to Stephanie. 
[03:28:00]  Stephanie, what's up?  Don't mind me, because I'm just going through all the pictures.  There's 150 of them.  Give them the good photos.  I want to find out, what didn't go in the barrel that you wanted in the barrel?  We went to, we're not going to lie, we went the distance.  The last thing was the huge hissing cockroaches.  Really?  And they took it, and, you know, that was it.  When we had no more to give, we had to get them out of there.  We got them out of the barrels.  Yeah.  They would have all lasted to seven at that point.  I was sure that one of the three that were left were going to just freak out and say, 
[03:28:30]  get me out of here.  Wendy was so close.  Did you hear her?  I mean, obviously, you know us.  We'll play that 800 times.  I got to hear her screaming, though, because that was authentic screams of horror.  Yeah.  We'll have some clips on that.  I think all the women in America should thank Opie and Anthony for what they do every single  day.  Because you just show all the power that us women have over you guys.  Well, you guys did a great job today.  I would never last that long. 
[03:29:00]  Oh, my God.  It's a tasting when the girls get out of the barrel.  All right.  Cool.  They're out.  That was some kind of a POW camp torture that soldiers go through.  Big Kev, get the ladies back here.  We got to talk to them before we get off the air.  Danny, what's going on?  Danny.  Hello.  What's up?  Danny, you're on the radio.  Go.  Yeah, what's up, man?  I crapped myself listening to this, man.  You crapped yourself today?  Yeah.  I went to a job.  Hey, this is all Angry Black Manny.  What's up, fellas?  Yeah, I remember you.  What's up?  I was on my way from a job interview. 
[03:29:30]  You know, I had the runs and stuff.  Yeah.  I'm on my way.  I got on the slacks and everything.  I'm cringing so hard.  A little bit squeezed out, fellas.  Pop the nugget.  You pop the nugget.  Cranky.  Ah, look who's in the studio.  Thank you, Danny.  Well, we got this.  Christy is in the studio.  Christy, any regrets of, um, wait, get that mic.  Yeah, grab that mic.  That's the only mic that works right now.  Any regrets, uh, getting out of the barrel early?  Yeah.  Oh, really?  Oh, really?  You're starting to regret it a little bit.  Oh, I regretted it as soon as I said it, but I couldn't tag. 
[03:30:00]  But I would have passed out.  You're feeling better now?  Yeah, I would have rather gotten out and passed out than passed out in there, and then you'd  have to deal with me.  I am amazed at the strength of, uh, will you girls have, because no effing way, I would  have been crying like a baby in there.  Oh, when the bugs started coming in.  I mean, let's talk to the girls that had to deal with the hissing cockroaches.  Uh, Tabitha?  Yeah, Tabitha.  Who's looking very, uh, pretty again?  All you girls are looking pretty again.  It's amazing what a little water will do. 
[03:30:30]  Yeah.  So, so, so what was going three ahead when you were in that barrel?  Oh, God.  Just get it over with and get us out of here as soon as possible, basically.  I mean, there's no way you can spin it and make it be a pleasant experience.  Right.  The first live bugs were the, uh, not cockroaches, the crickets.  Right.  Now, all you girls thought they were biting you, like biting bugs or something?  Yeah, when they're crawling on your skin, it was...  Well, they have those little, like, things on their legs, and when they crawl on you,  it feels a little pinchy.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[03:31:00]  And then there were the, uh, mealworms and waxworms, uh, various types of maggot and larvae.  Larva?  Larvae.  That was all over the, uh, girls.  How did those feel on you?  Those weren't quite as bad, because you didn't look at them.  You really didn't know that they were there.  Right.  And I heard a lot of slapping.  Who was...  Now, that was you?  Now, what...  Jane, right?  Yeah.  What were you doing, uh, to try to get these bugs away from you?  I was just slapping them off me.  You were slapping... 
[03:31:30]  And I'm killing them anyway.  That was the sickest sound, uh, coming from the barrels.  I mean, the screaming was sick, but when you could hear the slapping of water as you're  trying to kill bugs.  Water?  No, it was the slapping of goop.  I was a lot of potty.  It was very disgusting.  And then, of course, the grand finale.  The huge, hissing cockroaches.  Uh, now, a couple of you didn't even know that they were on you?  No, we knew they were on us.  Did you know what they looked like and what they were?  Yeah.  Did you know they were big? 
[03:32:00]  No.  No?  Yeah, I've seen enough of those nature shows to know exactly what that was crawling on  me.  And let me tell you, that was so awful.  Really?  If that wasn't the last thing, I probably would have hopped out.  Oh, really?  Uh-huh.  Look at that.  Well, we couldn't think of anything else besides maybe live rats.  That was really bad.  Kate didn't make it to that point.  Are you glad?  Yeah.  You're very glad, right?  No way.  I would have jumped right out of there.  And we're missing Wendy.  Where is she?  Is Wendy all right?  Oh, she's still cleaning up.  Picking bugs out of her hair. 
[03:32:30]  All right.  Let's go to Pete real fast.  Pete, what's up?  Yo, guys.  Hey.  That show was great.  I just got to tell you, we had about four guys standing here around the radio listening  to what was going on.  And we'd send one guy back to the computer to check out the pictures.  That was absolutely awesome.  Yeah.  And that girl, Wendy, man, with those screams, they were just like unbelievable.  Yeah, Wendy's screams were unbelievable.  They were like coming all the way from her toes all the way up to her mouth, man.  She was completely horrified.  Unbelievable.  And you know what I learned today?  Huh?  I learned that those girls in those barrels were more of a man than a yakking pussy Rick. 
[03:33:00]  All right, man.  Thank you, Pete.  Thank you.  All right.  Let's go to Julie.  Julie, how are you?  Julie?  Yes.  Hey.  I just want to tell you guys, this is a really great effort, but this is why women give birth  and men don't.  Because they can stand this sort of torture and physical pain without, you know, excessive  whining.  I'm not going to take anything away from any of these things.  That's all I want.  And I know because I have a five-year-old and I'm married to a musician.  And so, you know, I've got like, you know, pain squared. 
[03:33:30]  Right.  All right, Julie.  You guys rock.  Take care.  Thank you.  Bye.  Where's Wendy?  We've got to make sure she's okay.  Andrew, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Yeah, today I learned that it sucks to be around at Fez, number one.  Like Ann said, a smell that Fez isn't familiar with.  Yeah.  Number two, it's still too early for you guys, even when you have a great show planned.  You have to play an eight-minute metallic and some kid rock.  Well, whatever.  We like rocking.  And number three.  Yeah, I got it.  He cursed. 
[03:34:00]  Let's go to Anthony, the limo driver.  Anthony, how are you?  Hey, yo.  What's going on?  I heard we, I got a what have we learned today for you guys.  I'm cleaning out my nose, by the way.  Yeah, what's up?  I can just picture you right now.  I know you're pale as a ghost.  And Anthony's got a six-pack in the refrigerator waiting right now.  No, we did all right.  I mean, the chum, we got to talk to the ladies about the chum, was just horrendous.  And then the sour milk on top of that was just out there, man. 
[03:34:30]  Look at some of the email we're getting.  And this Ikea boy saying, I'm serious, this gave me a two-hour erection.  We have a new slogan now.  This guy's getting excited from hearing the screams of horror.  Yeah.  Well, the screaming was just, the screaming was just out there, man.  Oh, God.  We have a new slogan now.  O.P. and Anthony, radio from the Inquisition.  All right.  Talk to you later, bro.  Thank you, Anthony.  Later, Anthony.  Bye.  Let's go to Tom.  Tom, you're next on NAW.  Yes, Tom. 
[03:35:00]  Yeah, I know.  Let's go.  Hey, I love you guys, man.  I'm in Tom's River.  By the way, we're not playing What Did We Learn Today?  We're just talking about this to end the show.  Go ahead, Tom.  Well, you guys love to torture women.  I learned that today.  I don't know.  I didn't feel good.  Halfway through it, I was like, man, this was just a bad idea.  You guys played it off like it was disgusting, but I think you guys really got off.  Yeah, we played it off.  Boy, we sure are clever in that we can play things off.  I think we have 20 witnesses out there that realized that we didn't play anything off. 
[03:35:30]  This was just fun.  It's what it is.  Hey, man, you guys got some great sound bites for the show now.  Yeah, we certainly do.  We don't need any of the fake screaming sound effects that they send radio stations on CDs.  Yeah.  We got the real deal.  All right.  Those girls have bigger balls than I do, too.  All right.  Thank you.  Thanks.  Bye.  Joey Paisano called and said, I will add $500 to gift certificate to equal $1,000.  What does that mean?  If you already had $500 on it, you could add another $500 to equal $1,000.  Rick, do you know what this is?  Oh, so all of them could add? 
[03:36:00]  $200 per person.  To go down to Paisano.  There you go.  Oh, he was giving each lady $100?  Right.  Oh, so now you guys got $200 gift certificates for Paisano.  That's all you're going to want to eat.  That's one of the many things you guys are going to walk away with.  Ah, here she is.  Wendy.  Yeah.  You all right, Wendy?  Yeah, I'm okay.  You okay?  Yeah.  Yeah, all cleaned up now.  Feeling better.  No?  My hair's nasty.  That's my put back.  Yeah.  It's still disgusting.  Now, you screamed with absolute horror.  The bugs totally killed me.  Jane didn't have much problem with the bugs at the end there, I noticed. 
[03:36:30]  She just looked like she gave in.  Like, it didn't matter what we did to her at that point.  She had just conceded that she was going to sit there and sit in whatever we threw in.  But you were just screaming.  I was terrified.  I was completely terrified.  And then once they got in, after they hit me all over the place, I threw them off.  And then they went into the water.  And I just pretend they weren't there.  And you felt them moving around all over me.  Now, those big ones.  Those really got to you.  Yeah.  I didn't want to know what it was.  But then you guys said it. 
[03:37:00]  Did you see them?  I was crying.  Did you see them yet?  No.  I still haven't had them.  We should have one of the guys bring in.  Just bring in the one.  Where's a bug guy?  Have him bring in one of those hissing bugs.  We're not going to scare you anymore.  But you've got to see what it was.  Oh.  I mean, the torture's over.  But you've got to see what it was.  Torture!  It's torture!  Dude, don't freak out the ladies.  I'm serious.  You know.  Just show them from a distance what it was.  This is...  Torture!  It's torture! 
[03:37:30]  Oh, my God!  Oh, my God!  That's what was in there.  That's what was in there.  Put it next to the mic again.  Listen to the noise it was making.  Listen to the noise it was making.  Oh, it hits it!  I'm shaking again!  I know, I know.  Put them back in there.  And those are being dumped on you.  I'm having flash.  I know.  It's like you spent time in the NAMM or something.  Oh, my God. 
[03:38:00]  Tyrell, what's up?  Hey, how you doing?  All right.  I just wanted to call up and say thank you for having a van out here today.  A new row.  Oh, cool.  Jeff and Trish were really good with us.  They gave us a lot of stickers.  We gave you guys some PBA cards.  I got your business card.  I'm going to mail some more out to you.  If you guys ever come out to New Rochelle, you do any kind of road shows, we'll be here  to support you in any way you need.  Hey, thanks, Tyrell.  We appreciate it.  No, thank you very much.  All right, man.  All right.  Take care.  Good job.  John McCain checking in from Vietnam, and I thought I was effing tortured. 
[03:38:30]  Let's go to Gorilla Boy on Line 6.  Gorilla Boy, what's up?  We're running around the corner from you guys on 56 and 6.  Yeah.  A guy stops us.  Actually, his wife is yelling at me, and her husband's throwing up outside the truck.  She goes, you guys just watched Bans, you bastards.  And he's giving me a finger going, nasty.  So I just wanted to, he won't come to the phone, and his wife's giving me the bird right  now.  That's funny.  And Gorilla Boy, where are you going to be this weekend? 
[03:39:00]  You've got to make it fast, though.  We're about off the air here.  We're going to be at the Danellon Theater in Danellon giving out wow stickers for a comedy  show.  So come on down.  We're going to give out wow stuff and a live comedy show.  All right on, man.  Thanks, guys.  Thanks for helping us out today.  Hey, any time.  You know that.  All right.  All right.  I think the final set of pictures are up on WNAW.com.  A total of 170 pictures were taken today, Anthony.  Great.  Yeah.  Huge amounts of pictures.  They'll be up there for a while, so if you can't get through now, try later.  You'll get there.  These girls are dazed and confused. 
[03:39:30]  I'm in shock.  We should let you ladies give some plugs.  You want to say anything?  Jane, start with you.  I got nothing to plug.  How was your experience?  You liked it?  You don't regret it?  Yeah, but I don't know if I'd come back next year to defend my championship.  Yeah, yeah.  That's a little rough.  Yeah, that is rough.  I got to agree with you.  We do have a new game, though, to play.  Oh, I can't take this game.  Well, we'll have to do it like in a warehouse next time.  Really?  What about you, Wendy?  Can I say hi to a couple people?  You can do whatever you want. 
[03:40:00]  You just gave us four hours of great radio, man.  Mario, Dan, Uncle Don's on.  Sherilyn Manson, the great one.  And, of course, my, can I say the B word online?  Yeah.  Okay.  My office bitch.  Yeah.  All right.  What about you, Kate?  Would I do it again?  Yeah.  I don't think so.  No.  No.  You were a lot braver than we thought, because, remember, we were talking to Kate early on  and said, no way she'll be the first to get out.  Yeah.  I was first.  You were first, yeah, but we thought you weren't going to last as long as you did. 
[03:40:30]  You almost made it to the end.  Yeah.  It was just the bugs.  Yeah.  No way.  You know, if I could just steal them.  Right.  Anyone you want to say hi to?  Any plugs that you have?  Are you going to be at the Comedy Connection or anything?  Comedy toilet in Poughkeepsie?  All right.  Okay.  Well, you're all set?  Yeah, I'm good.  And Tabitha?  Thank you.  Anyone?  I'm a little too hoarse from screaming to say much.  Yeah, the girls have lost their voices a little bit.  Yeah, no, I'm not planning on doing that or anything like that ever again. 
[03:41:00]  This is it.  I've paid my dues.  Yeah.  I'm over.  No more dares.  Nothing.  I'm over.  Got any plans for the cash or anything?  Not yet.  What does your husband think?  He was here the whole time.  Yeah, as soon as I told him about it and said I volunteered, there's no way he would have  let me back out of it.  Right.  I actually, I chickened out on wowing a couple of times, so I said this is how I would redeem  myself.  Oh, my God.  Well, it's some torture. 
[03:41:30]  Yes.  And finally, Christy, anything anyone else to say?  Well, thanks for letting me be here.  I enjoyed myself a lot.  You guys are all like stars now.  You're going to have to be at the next Roadshow.  You won't believe the reaction you'll get when you hit the stage with us.  You will not believe it.  Anyone you want to say hi to?  Any shout outs?  Any plugs?  Anything?  No?  I'll leave it at that.  Yeah, they're all just in, they're shell shocked at this point.  All right.  I think we're just about done.  Let's go to Chris.  Chris, what's up?  Hey, you guys are absolutely effing sick, man. 
[03:42:00]  I know.  It would be you.  Hey, she's coming out of the bucket.  Put the microphone in your face.  It's like Zepruder.  Oh, Mrs. Kennedy, could you just hold that piece of skull close to the camera?  Yeah, I know.  We don't want to admit it, but we're just as bad as the mainstream media.  We want to catch the shots in the audio.  You know what we've got to do?  Heck, you should have had Stone or Amy in there.  If that doesn't work for rehab, I don't know what would.  There you go.  All right, Chris.  Thank you.  All right, guys.  Jeff Norris has just made it back into the studio. 
[03:42:30]  Look at his face.  We've been smelling this crap for four hours.  We're used to it.  It's like perfume for us now.  Isn't that amazing?  All right.  Get your hand in.  All right.  Well, let's get out of here, Anthony.  Yeah, please.  Ladies, thank you.  Thank you very much.  Give yourselves a round of applause.  Bravo.  Now we're all going to go drink beer somewhere. 
[03:43:00]  Yeah.  And if you want to check out the pictures from today's show,  www.com.  There's 170 pictures from today's event.  We finally had a good show this weekend.  Gee, one.  One out of five, man.  Cool.  All right.  We'll see you guys Monday.  Have a great weekend.  And Donna and Mike are next.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  This happens to be one of my favorite shows.  I'm going to listen and learn.  I learned that from my ride home.  I'm going to wear the pants because I think that your show is so funny. 
[03:43:30]  I'm going to pee myself every day.  That's all.  Another goal we have.  Everybody wetting their pants on their drive home.  That's all.  That's all.  Why do you shamelessly waste my time like this?  1027 WNEW. </pre>
