<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts' characteristically vulgar and shocking opening.  The 12th anniversary of 9/11 was immediately addressed, noting the media's shift from celebratory events to more somber name readings. This transitioned into a heated discussion of President Obama's handling of the Syrian conflict, featuring strong criticism and offensive language directed at the president's perceived indecisiveness and reliance on Putin.  Clips of Obama's speeches were played, interjected with sarcastic commentary and crude jokes.  A debate on the overuse of "slippery slope" ensued.  A caller, Carl, a first responder, thanked the hosts for their support and shared a bizarre anecdote about the National Fire Academy banning "flip chart" due to its perceived offensiveness to Filipinos, prompting further inappropriate jokes.  The conversation returned to Obama's Syria policy and public disapproval of potential military intervention before pivoting to a scathing critique of Anthony Weiner's failed mayoral campaign and Sidney Leathers' continued attempts at relevance, employing highly offensive language to describe both.  The hosts speculated on Weiner's future, suggesting cable news, and detailed Weiner's concession speech and a later McDonald's encounter with Leathers.  Opie then shared an anecdote about his son's preschool application, complaining about a teacher holding his son's hand, leading to a discussion of the exorbitant costs of private preschools in Manhattan and the prevalence of children's food allergies.  The show ended with jokes about modern school policies and peanut allergies.

The broadcast continued with a segment focusing on the exorbitant costs of private school in New York City. Callers detailed substantial financial burdens, including fundraising demands and fees reaching $140,000.  The absurdity of fundraising tactics, like mandatory candy bar sales, was highlighted, alongside discussions of excessive school supply lists, the stressful school lottery system, and perceived neighborhood-based school quality differences.  The segment then abruptly shifted to discussions of Gene Simmons' arena football team and upcoming book, "Nothing to Lose," along with a CeeLo Green interview. The segment concluded with the playing of listener-created songs about E-Rock, a show producer, with the overall tone remaining highly informal and profane.

A soundbite competition judged by E-Rock followed, featuring crude and insulting entries referencing show personnel (Ant, Jim, Ohm, Sam, Roland, Travis, Sal, and Gary). Sal's arrival in the studio triggered a lengthy segment detailing his dislike of coworker Denny, citing unprofessionalism with guests (specifically Alyssa Milano), constant requests, and resentment over Denny's perceived seniority and unimportant job.  This led to a discussion of a song about Sal with highly offensive lyrics.  The segment also included complaints about other coworkers (Troy, described as "unpredictable" and "a loose cannon," and Jackie), the show's podcast, the new iPhone's reception, a coworker's podcast and TV viewing habits, and ongoing workplace remodeling.

The next segment centered on Apple's business practices and the iPhone and iWatch, with hosts and callers expressing frustration over Apple's perceived arrogance, incremental updates, and pricing.  An Apple Store employee, Jordan, offered an insider perspective.  The conversation included a debate on the appropriateness of 9/11 and Boston Marathon bombing jokes, featuring a caller's stand-up experience.  Extensive discussion and crude jokes about shirtless pictures of Vladimir Putin ensued. The segment concluded with discussion of Metallica concert tickets and a caller complaining about commercial break length.

The main show concluded 45 minutes over schedule, marked by explicit frustration from the hosts. A commercial for the Mayweather-Alvarez fight and a Dish Network ad followed. The “After Opie and Anthony Live” segment with Sam Roberts then began, noting Jim Norton's absence due to interviewing Gene Simmons.  The anniversary of 9/11 was discussed, with Roberts expressing discomfort at extensive MSNBC coverage. The conversation addressed 9/11's ongoing impact, the American economic situation (minimum wage, lack of middle-class jobs, manufacturing), and government subsidies.  Callers shared perspectives, including a McDonald's franchise owner's challenges with wage increases.  The TSA's effectiveness and potential Syrian military intervention were also touched upon, interspersed with explicit comments and tangents. The segment concluded with further callers and Roberts' remarks.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  And now, and now, the moment you've all been patiently waiting for.  Today's Opie and Anthony show starts now. 
[00:00:30]  Opie and Anthony show starts now. 
[00:01:00]  Opie and Anthony show starts now. 
[00:01:30]  Opie and Anthony show starts now. 
[00:02:00]  Opie and Anthony show starts now.  Opie and Anthony show starts now. 
[00:02:30]  Opie and Anthony show starts now. 
[00:03:00]  Hey, yo, what's up out there? 
[00:03:30]  Ice kill.  I mean, I see it.  That is not good.  Get ready to experience the thrill of a lifetime.  If you somehow find this offensive, just don't listen.  But my guess is you'll be sticking around.  Let's do this.  It's going down.  Jack.  Hey, it's Larry King welcoming you to the Opie and Anthony show right here on Sirius XM satellite radio.  Oh, this is a good radio right here.  Y'all are cooler and shit.  It starts funny and then it gets very uncomfortable. 
[00:04:00]  One of the most popular radio shows in the world.  Radio journalism at its best.  Hello, kids.  Hello, kids.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  They swear and they're vulgar and they talk about awful, awful things.  That's what you like, isn't it?  Very flavorful.  Yay.  That's what you like, isn't it?  Please welcome Opie.  The show is twisted.  I'm telling you, who's enjoying this shit?  That's what you like, isn't it?  Anthony.  The I want dick crisis.  I love when girls go through that.  I'm here for you, ladies.  Remember that.  That's what you like, isn't it?  And Jim Norton.  If a pussy could talk, it would say, die. 
[00:04:30]  That's what you like, isn't it?  Everything you are about to hear is real.  My nipples are kind of hard.  Kind of hard.  Good morning.  Welcome aboard.  Enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Yes. 
[00:05:00]  And we're off and running.  Good morning, everybody.  Certainly are.  Happy hump day.  Is it hump day?  Sure is happy hump day.  Wow.  But it's not a happy day.  Why is that?  12 years ago today.  What happened?  I don't know a thing.  A thing happened.  Is it 9-11?  A thing happened.  We've been talking about 9-11 for, I would say, about 12 years now.  9-11.  All right.  And they're going to be reading the names again.  Jesus. 
[00:05:30]  And they should read the names again, of course.  Certainly.  We said this a few years ago.  How long is this going to go on before the media taps out?  I don't think the people will ever tap out.  And I don't think, certainly the families will never tap out.  Didn't the media tap out one year or something?  I think they started tapping out.  Matt Lauer did last year.  Yeah.  They tapped out last year?  We lost one?  Yeah, the Today Show, yeah.  Because after 9-11, the anniversary every year, you know, everyone was all in.  Well, that first year was fucking just as goddamn crazy.  How about the first almost 10 years that everyone was all in? 
[00:06:00]  And now they're slowly dropping out of the reading of the names.  And I hear today they're not doing any speeches.  Now we're just doing names.  What do you mean?  No speeches like down there?  No speeches.  No speeches.  Billy Joel's going to sing a little thing.  And then they're going to start reading some names.  And that's what they're doing this year, yes.  Man.  So, what are you doing?  I don't know.  It's fucking a little cuticle problem.  I think I got it, though.  Cuticle problem.  Cuticle. 
[00:06:30]  Nothing cute about it.  It's horrible.  Wow.  Yeah, 9-11.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  You know how I remembered it was 9-11?  Because I was on the plane coming home.  That was close.  The flight attendant was, yeah, I know.  That was 12 years ago.  Oh, boy.  It was the same kind of plane, too, an American Airlines 767.  And the flight attendant I heard talking to the flight attendant, she said something about,  was it before 9-11?  Like, they were talking about something in the galley.  And I'm like, oh, my God.  It's fucking the 11th.  Right.  And then you went, Allah, what? 
[00:07:00]  Allah, what?  Jesus.  Did you see that clip of those fucking guys near the, they had some big gun at a little  dirt road intersection?  Yeah.  And it's like, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.  And they're all gathered around it.  And out of nowhere, this fucking missile comes and just eliminates them.  Wipes them all out.  Oh.  And it, it, like, knocked the guy that was doing the video back in the building.  He was, like, in a building.  Right.  And you just hear him go, hello, hello, wake up.  Hello, wake up.  What's that?  They love that. 
[00:07:30]  They love screaming that.  That's all they want to yell.  Good, bad, indifferent.  What's it going to take for the world to kind of get along?  Oh, never.  Never, right?  Never.  But could something happen where the world goes, oh, fuck.  We got to get, we got to get along.  Maybe.  Right?  Alien invasion.  Is the only thing.  Where we have to unite as a planet.  Like, you know, ID, Independence Day.  Do you realize how ridiculous this whole thing is?  I mean, you can't even wrap your head around how, how incredibly large the universe is. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah.  Some people say, what, the one, one piece of sand represents only one galaxy.  And then you look at the entire beach and that's all the galaxies.  And they said that's even maybe a small number.  And then you picked out one piece of sand.  And then inside that sand is one planet that fucking can't get along with each other.  Just can't even deal.  How ridiculous is that?  It is ridiculous.  If you really try to wrap your head around how, it's just ridiculous.  It shows how stupid we are and fucking primitive still. 
[00:08:30]  We are, right?  Yeah.  Humans like to think that we're pretty smart.  But I mean, yeah.  We're apes.  Yeah, we are apes.  We're just still stupid.  Just stupid.  I mean, this one piece of dust that's flying around, let's say this room, represents Earth.  And that little piece of dust has just ridiculous turmoil.  It's so stupid.  Especially since most of the turmoil going on these days is based on some magical fucking cloud living people that were like, our magic guy is better than your magic guy. 
[00:09:00]  Yeah, it would make sense if we were, you know, fighting over strawberries.  Right.  That would make more sense.  What country has the best strawberries?  Right.  And then you defend your strawberries.  But we're arguing over magical people things.  Right.  Other beings probably look at our planet the way we would look at a planet if they were fighting over color forms.  Yes.  Yes.  You retards.  Right.  What's the matter with you?  Yes.  I'm not questioning anyone's faith here, but you're right.  It all stinks so stupid to argue over invisible, magical people that live in the sky. 
[00:09:30]  So we're just going to just have just ridiculous turmoil.  Yeah, because of that.  In our little space in the universe.  Yeah.  You think if there is life elsewhere that they're also having turmoil or?  I'd hope so.  I'd hate to think we're so stupid that we're the only ones.  I mean, Obama's in a tough spot, huh?  He's an idiot.  I'm sorry.  A fucking moron.  He, you know, he talked a good game and he should have just, he should have just, you know. 
[00:10:00]  Should have done something right away.  Immediately.  If you're going to do something, just do it right away.  Immediately.  Oh, they used gas?  All right.  This is what we do now.  But now it's this big budel, as they say.  And what?  Putin's coming in to clean up his mess?  The fucking Russians have to come in and bail out fucking.  Because Putin is very trustworthy.  That mafia boss.  Exactly.  We're dealing with the mafia boss now.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Usually that doesn't work out well in the end.  Yeah.  Right?  Never.  You think you're pals with the mafia guy and then you realize, but what happened? 
[00:10:30]  So he's the guy.  Why am I getting thrown in a trunk?  I'm driven upstate.  Yeah.  He's the guy that's got to bail Obama out.  I don't know.  And Obama, I think, basically told the people last night that Assad, continue killing your own people.  Just don't use the gas.  Don't use no gas.  I think that's the message I got last night.  Of course it is.  Isn't that ridiculous?  We've already determined he's an asshole.  He's killed so many more people with conventional weaponry than with the gas. 
[00:11:00]  But don't kill him with the gas.  Yeah.  That's the red line because he'll continue killing his people.  We look so weak as a country now.  We look – it's back in the Carter days.  And we just look like a weak paper tiger, a joke.  Although we look that way after – whatchamacallit too?  After what?  In Africa.  In Somalia. 
[00:11:30]  Somalia.  Yeah.  That's why in modern plan 9-11.  Yeah.  It's one of those – you know, you get a Democrat in there.  And Obama is just the epitome of indecisiveness with everything.  He is not – I'm sorry.  Not a good leader.  He's just not.  I mean, and you could say they're all the same and everything.  I understand.  And especially with domestic shit and business and unemployment and things like that.  But when your foreign policy is a joke and you're indecisive as a world leader – 
[00:12:00]  He got Osama bin Laden.  He's not a joke.  You know what?  Let me tell you something.  He got us out of a couple of wars.  He's no joke, man.  This proves that he had nothing to do with that.  He's no joke.  He's such a joke.  He's no joke, sir.  He's a fucking joke.  I'm in the middle of him.  I don't know.  A fucking joke.  I thought he's been a little tougher than I thought he –  No.  Personally, he was tougher than I thought he'd be on the list.  He had nothing to do with any foreign policy that you've seen done. 
[00:12:30]  He put – he delegated cruise missiles and predator drone strikes to the people that need it, the military, the hawks, the people that know it.  They're in the know as far as who to fucking blow up and shit.  Right.  Okay, you do that.  I'll sit here.  But his constituency is – a lot of people who loved Obama or hate that he did that.  I love that he did that.  Again, he did not close Guantanamo.  And people are like, well, he lied, but he said he was going to do it.  And I guess whatever happens when you get elected, he didn't do it. 
[00:13:00]  So Guantanamo still – like he didn't do all this radical shit that was going to annoy me.  I'm very curious to get like a Republican president to see if there is a significant change or a Republican that could work around this system of ours.  There's always been – when a Republican is in office, for the most part –  It'll be very interesting.  You always have a strong –  Military.  Military.  A strong eye in the world eye, you know? 
[00:13:30]  Right.  You're always like, oh, wow, don't fuck with the United States.  They're fucking crazy.  Right.  But this guy – the fact that Putin's got to step in –  Putin!  And bail his fucking ass out –  But that's not going to work.  No, of course it's not.  It's not going to work.  What is he doing?  He's biding time because he's panicking.  He's panicky, Pete.  He really is.  I mean, you've basically said this guy's an animal, so you've got to make sure he's out of there.  Uh-huh.  Right?  You can't leave him in there.  Or just leave the whole situation alone, one or the other. 
[00:14:00]  Well, yeah, but he kind of committed.  Of course he did.  Now he's in a weird spot.  Here's a little highlight from last night's speech.  Our ideals and principles, as well as our national security, are at stake in Syria.  That's true.  Along with our leadership of a world where we seek to ensure that the worst weapons will never be used.  America is not the world's policeman.  Uh-huh.  Terrible things happen across the globe.  Really?  And it is beyond our means to right every wrong. 
[00:14:30]  Really?  But when, with modest effort and risk, we can stop children from being gassed to death.  Jimmy.  And thereby make our own children safer over the long run.  Oh.  I believe we should act.  That's what makes America different.  And do what?  That's what makes us exceptional.  Did you watch the speech last night?  No, I didn't.  At one point, I'm like, man, this guy is teasing.  Now we're going to fucking start bombing him right when he stops talking. 
[00:15:00]  Should have.  He was teasing it.  And then all of a sudden he went the other direction with the Putin thing.  Uh-huh.  But, I mean, you were watching that thing thinking, oh my God, we're going, you know, we're going to do something.  Here's another highlight.  Many of you have asked, won't this put us on a slippery slope to another war?  Oh, racist.  Fucking hate the slippery slope.  Slippery slopes.  Yeah.  Look out.  I wanted to say at the end of the day. 
[00:15:30]  At the end of the day.  At the end of the day, I'm really good with slippery slopes.  Yeah.  I don't fucking slide back down.  I take the steps.  Well, that's being good with them too.  Has a slippery slope ever really been a slippery slope since like maybe we sent advisors into Vietnam and it was a slippery slope?  Because every time someone says, oh, that's a slippery slope, it never really is.  No.  No.  When was the last slippery slope we really slipped on?  Who decided we needed to say slippery slope a lot?  Slippery slope.  Why do we say slippery slope? 
[00:16:00]  You ever notice a slippery slope is always on flat ground?  You ever notice that?  No, I didn't.  It's never really quite slippery.  Yeah.  I'll tell you what's slippery.  The satin pillow my head is on.  Oh, God.  That's slippery.  You know what's slippery?  The muscles in my jaw.  They slipped right down.  Now it sits on my chest for eternity.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  I don't, you know, slippery slope.  I hate that term.  Has it, has, have we?  Yeah.  Maybe Korea was a slippery slope. 
[00:16:30]  Korea.  Of us getting involved in other people's fucking business.  Yeah.  And not knowing how to end it.  That was a long slope.  And then look what happened.  And from then you got Vietnam and then from then you had fucking Iraq and Afghanistan and  now this.  But do they really want to end this?  Thank you.  At the time.  Sometimes you just don't want to end the war thing.  Well, when we thought we were going to lose Southeast Asia to the commies.  Right. 
[00:17:00]  Uh, we had to do something in that context of those times, the early sixties, late fifties,  early sixties.  We, we were in a real fucking battle with the Soviets and China about communism.  So it made sense to send troops in dead.  Now it looks like, Oh, why the, what the fuck are we doing?  People, but people don't understand our own national security back then was to keep communism  from, you know, sweeping around the world.  We had a real reason, right? 
[00:17:30]  Yeah.  That was even a reason.  But in hindsight, you had our own interest.  We had to protect.  Yeah.  In hindsight, though, you look and go, that wasn't really a reason.  In hindsight.  Hindsight.  At the end of the day, it's a slippery slope.  Oh, wow.  Oh, yes.  Look out.  Let's kick the can down the street and think about that for a little while.  You want to throw the ball around with the ladies?  I'm not sure if I want to go with that one.  I was cracking over there yesterday.  I'm not sure if I want to go with that one.  I went home.  It was the Bill Burr thing. 
[00:18:00]  And then, you know, you step outside.  It's a beautiful sunny day.  And I'm like, what am I doing?  Oh, boy.  We like those guys.  Yeah, but that is funny.  Okay.  All right.  Then fuck it.  I'm going to go with it.  Many of you have asked.  Oh.  Won't this put us on a slippery slope to another war?  One man wrote to me that we are still recovering from our involvement in Iraq.  I think more than one person wrote that.  A veteran put it more bluntly.  This nation is sick and tired of war.  My answer is simple.  Simple. 
[00:18:30]  I will not put American boots on the ground in Syria.  Because they're made in China.  I will not pursue an open-ended action like Iraq or Afghanistan.  I will not pursue a prolonged air campaign like Libya or Kosovo.  This would be a targeted strike to achieve a clear objective.  Then do it!  Stop talking about it!  Determining the use of chemical weapons and degrading Assad's capabilities.  Jesus.  We're still going to do something.  He talks about it like, like, Noah, both of them.  Kerry, him. 
[00:19:00]  They've just talked about this.  Like, don't worry.  It's nothing.  Don't worry.  What did fucking Kerry say?  It's a small, tiny, teeny, tiny little thing we're going to do?  Yes.  Then fucking just do it.  Yeah, shut your face.  Do it already.  Stop groveling for approval from everybody and do it.  Right.  If you're going to do it, do it.  Be a leader.  Do it.  Be a leader.  Holy fuckaroni.  But then again, the public doesn't want him to do it, right?  Yeah.  That's true.  Yeah.  So that's a tough spot for him.  But who cares?  If the public doesn't want you to do it.  So what?  He's waiting for the public to turn around and then he'll finally do it? 
[00:19:30]  They're not going to turn around.  Because the Putin thing is a joke, obviously.  Do it or don't do it, but do something.  He's using the Putin thing to try to get the support of the American people on his side.  He's using Putin.  He knows the Putin thing isn't going to work.  You know when I like a slippery slope?  What?  I'm tobogganing.  Yeah, of course.  You go tobogganing, it's like, hey, look, a slippery slope.  And then you go, oh, cool.  Let's fucking-  That's what I'm talking about.  Skiing, snowboarding.  Yes.  You know when I don't like a slippery slope?  When?  When someone says, hey, we need to get that safe of old dynamite on top of that slope. 
[00:20:00]  That, now, is bad.  Yeah.  You slip and it falls on you.  Old sweaty dynamite.  Yeah, I have that a lot.  Yes.  I don't know.  I'm just sick of seeing John Curry.  His face is creeping me the fuck out.  That's weird.  He's got that one dead-looking eye socket.  I finally figured it out.  He's a rock-em-sock-em robot.  Big blockhead. 
[00:20:30]  He's a big blockhead.  You knocked my block off.  What is wrong with him?  He does.  He's got, like, that square.  Is it Botox?  What is going on?  Yeah, maybe it is.  Maybe he tried to do something.  I don't want my politicians doing, you know, Botox.  Yeah.  Taking Botox shots.  When did it happen?  Because when he was like, you know-  I don't know.  I'm ready for, what did he say?  You got to go old-school rock-em-sock-em, Sam Roberts.  My name is John Kerry.  That's old-school?  Reporting for duty.  Reporting for duty.  All right.  How embarrassing is that?  He didn't look like that then. 
[00:21:00]  Do you think that's embarrassing, that moment?  Oh, God, what an embarrassing moment.  Reporting for duty.  Reporting for duty.  And he saluted.  Oh, what an asshole.  If he had a dildo and he tapped his forehead with it, that would have been less embarrassing.  There you go.  Oh, they did it?  No, but you could-  Oh, yeah, look.  The rock-em-sock-em robot.  The old-school rock-em-sock-em robot.  That's what John Kerry's face looks like.  Those were fun for five minutes.  I hated that toy.  One of the most overrated toys ever.  Rock-em-sock-em robots. 
[00:21:30]  Fun for five minutes.  Right?  Then it just got like-  And then you set them on fire and watch them melt.  We loved watching our toys melt.  Yeah.  On the way to Memorial, wants to say thanks.  Wow, really?  For what?  Carl, what's up, buddy?  Good morning.  Good morning, John.  Hey, buddy.  Carl.  I broke out the uniform on my way down to the Memorial, and I just wanted to say thank  you for your support through the years and always acknowledging the uniform services and 
[00:22:00]  the support that they do.  I appreciate that very much.  We were first responders with laughs.  That's right.  We responded with some chuckles for everyone.  First responders.  That is true.  Yes.  I was listening on the radio, and it's always, I many times feel like I'm part of a little  group of guys who's getting a good laugh.  That's good.  I got one for you.  Oh!  I teach at the National Fire Academy on occasion, and they're very, very strict about terms,  and one of the terms, they give us a piece of paper of the things you can't say. 
[00:22:30]  You can't use the term flip chart anymore.  Flip chart?  Remember easel charts?  You have to call it easel charts.  Why?  Those things that you write on, you can't call it a flip chart.  Why?  It's derogatory against Filipinos.  What, they call them flips?  I guess so, yeah.  Yeah.  I never do that.  So what is it?  Fucking easel Wilson?  It's an easel chart.  Easel Wilson.  We don't have an easel chart.  Jesus. 
[00:23:00]  I couldn't think of another famous flip.  Of course, another flip.  All right.  All right.  Thank you.  I've got to keep up on my fucking slurs.  I didn't even know that.  I know.  Yeah.  Fucking people, you say that, someone's going to fucking easel out on you.  Oh, God.  Wow.  What?  Everyone's telling Obama's a fucking easel flop president.  What am I supposed to do?  It's not my fault.  You're supposed to stop.  You're right.  I can't.  I can't.  To break down the Obama thing, what do you think happened?  He just assumed, like, holy fuck, this is brutal, what's going on in Syria, and obviously 
[00:23:30]  the American people will be behind me.  What did I just do?  Yeah.  And then the polls come back, and he's like, oh, my God, they don't want me to do this.  He backed himself into a corner saying that red line shit.  Right.  He said, you know, if they use gas, that's the red line.  Right.  Because people were saying there's hundreds of thousands or 100,000 people that have been  dying over there in Syria.  What are you going to do about it?  He's like, well, we're going to sit back, and if he uses that gas, that's when we're 
[00:24:00]  going to do something.  That's the red line.  So then he uses the gas.  Then they use the gas, and now he's put himself in the corner where if he doesn't do something,  he looks like, you know, the paper tiger.  And just a dumb, you know, airstrike's not going to do anything.  Of course not.  You've got to get the guy out of there.  He's saying that.  But then it's like nobody wants us involved in a civil war like that.  It's figuring, you know.  And then what?  So now he's put in a position where he's got to do something or do nothing, one or the  other.  And he should have immediately fired some shit at something, whatever. 
[00:24:30]  It might be useless, but at least it doesn't look like he doesn't.  He has no decisiveness with anything.  Anything.  They say that is a big criticism of him.  But they say he also does carefully consider every option.  But I think he shot himself in the foot by saying that.  I think it was a dumb thing to say.  It was really stupid.  He's just not the same guy that gave that amazing speech.  Oh, God.  Where the place was going.  The keynote address at the fucking Democratic National Convention a million years ago. 
[00:25:00]  In 2004, yeah.  That was also before.  That's already nine years ago, huh?  Yeah.  Now when he talks like that, it kind of annoys me.  Like it sounds too patterned and rehearsed.  You don't buy it anymore.  Right, you don't buy it anymore.  When he gave a speech at the fucking Martin Luther King 50th anniversary thing.  Right.  He sounds completely different then.  You listen to the speech he gave last night.  And then he puts on that black thing.  Oh, America.  Here in America.  What the fuck? 
[00:25:30]  Where did you come from?  I'm sorry.  At least he's only being half phony.  Hillary's 100% phony when she does it.  We come to fire.  I remember when I was bailing hay.  Oh, wait.  Those were just my calves I was lifting to put my shoes on.  She's the worst.  She's got a sensible haircut now.  Does she?  I haven't seen her new do, Sam.  She changed up her hair.  She does look sensible.  She looks ready to run for president. 
[00:26:00]  She's too old.  I know.  She's going to run.  How old is she?  She's 82.  She fucking might as well be, dude.  What, is she like 66 or something?  She's 65, 66, yes.  That's what you want.  A 70-year-old lady.  That's who's got her finger on the pulse.  A useless womb.  A woman I don't want to talk to for five minutes at Walmart.  I want running the free world.  Yeah.  But what does Bill do?  That's got to be the weirdest thing ever.  He just fucking walks around, swaggers.  He's just going to walk around the White House? 
[00:26:30]  Hey, I'm the first gentleman.  You do want to see that, right?  Yeah.  You know what?  You kind of want to see that.  He's back again.  Then what does he do?  In his fucking pajama bottoms.  How you doing?  And does he have to hang out with the world leader's wives and stuff?  Oh, all the world leaders are crying.  Do what the first ladies do.  Pick out the fucking china pattern.  That's good.  I'm picking out the Christmas tree this year.  I got a pillbox hat on like Jackie O.  He just fucking walks around totally mocking the first lady thing. 
[00:27:00]  That would be great.  Damn it.  You're right.  I want Hillary now.  That would be fun.  He will be the guy giving a tour of the White House.  Yeah, yeah.  You know what might help him?  Scratching his balls.  What might help her is the idea of him being in the White House again.  People might like the idea of Bill Clinton being a...  Believe me, he'll be a part of her thought process.  Puppet regime.  Have her in there as president.  But he's like kind of pulling some strength.  Of course.  I'll make a phone call, Hillary.  And could he be vice president technically?  I don't think so.  I don't even think you're able to fucking like be president if something happens to the president 
[00:27:30]  and you're next in line.  I don't think you're able to do that after two terms.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  What can you do?  How far can you go in government once you've been president?  He can be a senator, can't he?  Can he though?  I think he can.  I don't think any of them do.  Sure.  Because I think it's that step down thing.  So I think once you're president, you just fucking, you know, you're done.  Right.  You get spit out the top.  Game over kind of a thing.  Sure.  Um, but man, that'd be funny.  A tour going through the White House and they come around a corner and he's just in his 
[00:28:00]  pajama bottoms.  How you doing?  Hey, come on in here.  He's just drinking a fucking beer.  I would love that.  Scratching his bull sack.  That would be cool.  So you got the, uh, the wieners officially out.  Yeah.  That's it.  I guess de Blasio.  Did de Blasio get, um, get enough votes where he, there's no runoff or anything?  He's the guy.  He's the fucking guy.  On the primary and it's all because of his Afro kid.  Afro kid really did it.  Put him over the top.  When Bloomberg didn't like that.  He said it was kind of a, he was using race, uh, to muscle himself in there. 
[00:28:30]  I missed Bloomberg already.  With Afro kid.  Afro kid.  The, the reveal on Afro kid was fucking brilliant.  Yeah.  And, and, and then he just shot up in the polls because of Afro kid.  I vote for him.  Even if he wasn't my dad.  What?  What?  Wow.  You gotta be shitting me.  I didn't see that commercial.  Oh yeah.  It's a good one.  Dude, I've never seen that commercial.  Come on.  I swear to you.  I've never seen that commercial.  I went, what?  What?  I want to see. 
[00:29:00]  Do we know the poll numbers before and after Afro kid?  Afro kid.  Put him right over the top.  Because he was kind of what?  In the middle?  In the polls?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Quinn was.  And then he shot up.  People were talking about Colin.  Colin Quinn.  Colin Quinn.  Christine Quinn.  I want to be a mayor.  Less fucking.  Colin's less manly than fucking.  Yeah, we have fucking both have sensible hairdos.  You've never seen this commercial?  No, I swear to you.  Oh, this is the only reason.  Let's watch it.  I want to tell you.  Here it is.  This is the only reason he's the guy now.  He's the only Democrat with the guts to really break from the Bloomberg years. 
[00:29:30]  The only one who will raise taxes on the rich, on early childhoods, and after school programs.  He's got the boldest plan to build affordable housing.  Like, oh.  And he's the only one who will end a stop-and-frisk era that unfairly targets people of color.  Ugh.  Bill de Blasio will be a mayor for every New Yorker.  Oh, good.  No matter where they live or what they look like.  Who's this kid?  And I'd say that even if he were my dad.  What?  What?  What?  What?  Wow.  But he's, but he's in your.  What?  But. 
[00:30:00]  Wow.  What?  Holy shit.  How did that, but?  And you know he made his son grow the afro.  Grow that afro, son.  Grow that afro.  I'm running.  Get it as big as you can.  Right.  You got a year to get that afro in shape.  I don't want anyone looking, saying, well, he could be that.  No.  No.  We want a giant afro on you.  The kid was horrible at reading, by the way.  That's stopping first.  He was reading that whole shit, and it was off to the side of the camera.  I kind of like the idea that we could go back to the 80s and early 90s of Manhattan. 
[00:30:30]  I really want GTA fucking 5 in New York City again.  All fucking degenerates.  Hookers.  Fucking squeegee people.  Seedy.  A couple porn theaters.  Bring back diesel buses.  Black smokes.  Billowing out of buses.  Just staining everything.  Not even that you have to.  Why would technology go backwards? 
[00:31:00]  But I want that.  Those buses would go down Broadway and just stain everything.  Blowing shit and everything.  Those fucking poor cement on the curbs that are cut for the handicapped.  Put the curbs back again.  Exactly.  Everything back like the 80s.  Take those fucking potted plant shits out.  Goodbye.  Goodbye.  Man.  Cops on the beat again.  I could just fucking hammer people.  Give them the wood shampoos.  The Motorola shampoo.  The Maglite shampoo. 
[00:31:30]  All of it.  What's funnier than a wood shampoo?  A wood shampoo.  Yeah.  We gave the old wood shampoo.  You beat them with a billy club over the head.  And being proud of it too.  It's fantastic.  Remember when everything...  Yes.  Thank you.  Everything smelt like piss.  Oh yeah.  Urine.  No matter where you went, everything smelt like piss.  Homeless urine.  That was Manhattan.  I miss it.  What's the fuck?  I can make a club.  Well, hopefully de Blasio can bring all that back. 
[00:32:00]  I don't know.  Then you got the other guy who used to run the MTA, right?  La Joda.  Oh boy.  What's a comfortable name to say?  La Joda.  La Joda.  La Joda.  Anthony Weiner, though.  Yeah, he's done.  He had to conceive last night.  And then he jumped in his car and gave everyone the finger.  That's great.  Way to go.  Way to go, buddy.  That's good.  That's like how Tricky Dick fucking got on the steps of the helicopter and gave the peace  sign.  He fucking flipped everybody off.  He's flipping everyone off like I don't...  He doesn't understand why. 
[00:32:30]  I don't have Anthony Weiner to kick around anymore.  He's very, very arrogant, this Anthony Weiner.  Yeah, he is irritating.  He's extremely arrogant.  Entertaining as fuck, but...  You can't flip everyone the bird.  Mm-hmm.  Unless in your head you really know it's over in politics.  Yeah.  What's he going to do now?  Do you see speeches?  Yeah, he'll be on...  Beat his wife.  I bet you...  Frustration.  He's going to be on one of these news channels.  He'll do the Elliot Spitzer.  Elliot Spitzer did it, but he was just such a bore they couldn't keep him on there. 
[00:33:00]  Weiner would be great.  Like fucking...  Oh, he's going to...  Just going off like he did with O'Donnell.  Just fucking going...  Like, he'd be great to watch.  He's going to...  Mark my word, Anthony Weiner's going to be a TV star.  Yeah?  Yeah.  One of these cable outlets will pick him up in a second.  Fox?  Oh, you think he could?  Yeah.  That would be fun.  That would be fun if he went on Fox, of course.  Could be CNN.  Probably CNN.  They'd have him?  Probably.  MSNBC definitely would have him.  MSNBC would definitely take him, yeah.  They're taking like fucking Alec Baldwin now, I guess.  Alec Baldwin's going to have a show. 
[00:33:30]  I guess.  On MSNBC and then they gave one to Reverend Alec.  It's like fucking give one to anybody on there.  They're desperate.  Any lib.  Yeah.  So here's Anthony Weiner saying bye-bye.  I have to say, ladies and gentlemen, there's no doubt about it.  We had the best ideas.  Sadly, I was an imperfect messenger.  Who's that?  And you know what?  When I would travel around when sometimes things got a little dicey on the campaign.  And I'd go to a subway stop or I'd go to a concert or a church service.  Sometimes people would come up to me and they'd wrap their arms around me or they'd pull me close to whisper in my ear. 
[00:34:00]  They'd take my hand.  Your rear?  And they'd say, don't quit.  That's right.  Well, there was never any quit in this campaign.  Woo-hoo!  That was it, really?  That's the highlight?  And then he was thanking everybody.  Okay.  But his wife was not thanked.  Oh, boy.  Oh, shit!  Because his wife wasn't there.  Wow!  Yeah, that's done-ski.  Did you hear that Sidney Leathers showed up to his party? 
[00:34:30]  I heard that, yes.  What a cunt.  She showed up?  She's a lovely gal.  Oh, sorry.  And she had a big sign.  She had a sign?  What is she doing?  That's why he was so mad at flipping people off, because she followed him around.  What did her sign say?  It said something about not voting for Wiener.  Like, it was during the day.  What a f-  She was holding up a sign.  Piece of shit.  She's a piece of shit.  She said something about not voting for Wiener and advertising her app that she's coming up with.  Atta girl!  Oh, of course.  What, she thinks she's going to continue being famous?  Goodbye.  Yeah, she said-  No, she's not. 
[00:35:00]  They asked her about her 15 minutes being over.  She's not hot enough.  And she said it's a lot more than 15 minutes.  No, no, no.  No, no.  Jennifer Flowers?  Woo-hoo.  She might make the end of the year, and that's about it.  That sweet angel is going to continue her con.  Oh, Christ on a pony.  I certainly do.  Yeah, sure she is.  Delightful young lady.  You got some information, Jim Norton?  Why would you support this brunt?  I just think she's lovely.  Her lipo and her fake tits that she got.  Yeah, she got implants, right?  Yeah.  And lipo.  You know what?  Oh, I couldn't work. 
[00:35:30]  She's moving into the porn world, because that's a great business model right now.  Yeah.  For HIV fucking people.  Yeah, she gets into fucking porn and finds out she fucked some guy that fucking has the  fucked someone with the HIV.  Yeah.  She fucked some guy who fucked somebody with the HIV.  Well, the guy who had the HIV did gay porn, too.  And I bet he was banging this chick with his girlfriend.  Just whatever her name was.  Something Bay.  Carmen Bay.  And then he fucking probably gave it to her.  I think most of it came from gay porn.  Jesus.  Her new boobies are nice, but see, she's got that fucking- 
[00:36:00]  She's got that fake dress on.  That fake dress that gives you the fake figure.  You put the black on the sides.  The next thing you know, you look a little slimmer.  It's like what Boy George started doing with his chin when he painted all black to make it  look like he didn't have the double chin.  They have the dress.  The sides are black.  The middle has the shape she wants to have.  Of course.  So she walks around with a fake fucking body.  And then she's just got to find dark backgrounds, and you look great. 
[00:36:30]  Yes, just stand in front of black things.  You look great.  But from what I read, Wiener went to McDonald's after his concession speech.  Yeah.  And then he got followed by a bunch of reporters, and Sidney Leathers followed him there.  Oh, that's pathetic.  And so they kind of chased him out, and that's when he flipped everybody off.  Of course.  He was like, leave me the fuck alone.  He's this bitch following me.  Yeah, that's sad.  Well, that's what he gets for committing sin.  Well, true.  He's a sinning man.  He is a sinner.  And she's just going to every reporter, talking about what a bad person he is. 
[00:37:00]  What's her problem?  And she just spreads her fucking legs for the video.  And go away.  What a mistake.  Bitches like that.  Wow, did he fuck up.  What a mistake.  It's like, I could have just picked somebody that would have stayed quiet.  Yeah.  This bitch just trying to fucking get a career out of texting me.  He did make a mistake.  He did.  But he should have just put it, stopped jerking off until he got the gig again.  Exactly.  Did you mention that Wiener couldn't walk through the front of a bar? 
[00:37:30]  He had to go through McDonald's.  Is that why he went through McDonald's?  Why couldn't he go through the bar?  I don't know.  I mean, I know he went through McDonald's.  There were already two Jews in it.  What?  Matt in New York.  Two Jews.  Yes.  Morning, guys.  I actually heard this on going local on Wins this morning that apparently the bar he did the speech at.  There were so many people.  He actually did some McDonald's.  Who would think a McDonald's would be connected to the bar like this?  He actually had to go through the McDonald's on the side, sneak in to get in, and then walk down that one. 
[00:38:00]  Yeah, just the entrance he used.  Anthony Wiener's not going away.  But so she was in the bar waiting for him, Sidney Leathers was.  Right.  And then when he exited through the McDonald's, she chased him into the McDonald's just to harangue him.  What a bitch.  That's kind of funny.  What a bitch.  So of course he's going to flip people out through his window.  Kind of funny, but she's got to go away.  What a nuisance she is in his life.  She's not hot enough to stick around.  I'm sorry. 
[00:38:30]  She's all right.  She's aight.  No, she's not good enough, though.  You're right.  She's aight.  I disagree with you, gentlemen.  I think she's a lovely gal.  Do you have a story, Jimmy?  No.  Okay.  I just think she's not lovely.  She's a pig.  You want to look at her like, what's your problem?  Yeah.  What's your problem?  Just leave the guy alone.  That man harassed this young lady, and he got his comeuppance.  I don't think he did harass her.  He did poke her.  She ended his fucking career. 
[00:39:00]  This is all because he poked her on Facebook.  Harassment.  God, she just ended his fucking career.  But I get his point of view, too.  It's like, you know.  I was watching a show on when they tape somebody trying to have their spouse murdered.  And the woman goes, I hope you're not taping me.  And it's like, they know sometimes that you could be taping them, but they want it to happen so badly.  And it's like those guys that would show up to fucking meet, to catch a predator, even though they knew.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, I knew this could happen.  Like, we had to know this was possible, but when you're fucking cranking your dick, you're just not, you're like, ah, it won't happen, won't happen, ah, whatever. 
[00:39:30]  He's going to be on TV, and he's going to give us great TV.  I can't wait.  But, like, imagine if every golf tournament that Tiger Woods was in, the Perkins waitress was just right next to him going, fuck you, Tiger.  She tried to get into the Masters one year.  She did?  I believe so, yeah.  The Perkins waitress?  One of them.  Not the Perkins waitress.  Perkins waitress was a good edge.  She kept their fucking mouth shut.  It was the other one.  Remember her? 
[00:40:00]  Of course not.  Do we know her name?  Of course not.  She's exactly right.  Well, the one had to give the money back.  Right.  Rachel Yucatel.  Oh, look at you.  I remember her name.  Because she ended up on Celebrity Sober House Rehab thing with Dr. Drew.  And she's alive?  The death doctor.  Dr. Drew.  Dr. Death, yes.  Dr. Death, Drew.  Oh, my point.  Oh, yeah.  So one of Tiger's girls tried to do what you're talking about.  Oh.  And they pushed her out.  And she was, like, she was at a golf.  I think she was at a golf course close to the Masters, like, trying to start shit. 
[00:40:30]  And everyone's, like, yeah, but he's over there.  Oh, she wasn't even in the right position?  She wasn't allowed.  But she still wanted to do what this broad did last night, so she was trying to create  some heat for herself somewhere else.  Well, Sidney Leather's got the job done.  Oh, yeah.  For now.  Yeah, I mean, all over the papers today, but.  It's done.  Like, he's done.  Yeah, now what is she going to do?  Well, if he ends up on TV and he's got a live studio audience, she'll be there every day. 
[00:41:00]  She'll be there.  Boo!  Boo!  Boo!  Did you just walk up and punch her in the face?  Yeah.  That would be great at this point.  It wouldn't hurt him.  Right.  Just walk up and punch her in the face.  Oh.  Yeah.  Jimmy made a very good point right before the show.  Spitzer also lost, but Spitzer got 48% of the vote.  He barely lost.  He barely lost.  The winner was who at 52?  The other guy.  The other guy.  Thank you.  Yeah.  It was the other guy.  Yeah.  I didn't really follow that race at all, but Jimmy said that. 
[00:41:30]  You know, Spitzer actually got hookers.  He was fucking.  Wiener.  Yeah.  It looks like Wiener never, never, you know, touched abroad.  He didn't.  Yeah.  And he got way more heat than Spitzer did.  Uh-huh.  Way more.  And Spitzer was actually getting hookers?  Yeah.  But it goes to what we've said all along that, you know, people are willing to forgive  and give you another shot.  If you do it once.  Yeah.  The problem doing it twice, that's rough for most people.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:42:00]  I still say he resigned.  He's allowed to keep doing it.  Wow.  I still say he resigned.  He's allowed to keep doing it.  It's either or.  Hmm.  Lucky him.  Yeah.  It will be interesting to see where he goes now, what he does.  I gotta, I gotta go to school today.  What?  Hmm?  I guess I'm going back to school.  I, I don't know.  Oh, did you have your home visit yesterday?  Yeah.  Hey, how'd that go?  Ugh.  Yeah, I had my home visit.  Just being judged for a woman that you're paying?  Two teachers come into my house. 
[00:42:30]  My kid is starting up school.  He's not even three and a half.  20, $20,000.  Doing interviews?  For a three and a half year old.  They come in.  What'd they do?  No interview.  Search around.  And then of course my kid runs away because he's like, what the fuck is this?  He's all.  Did they go, oh, oh, oh.  And write something.  Oh, he's a runner.  Oh.  Not very social, is he?  Oh, well.  Some, some social problem.  They weren't, they probably were just storing it away because they didn't break out a pen  and pencil.  No, no clipboard. 
[00:43:00]  But then you feel like, oh my God, my kid's not acting his role.  So then you're, then you panic like, it's okay.  You can talk to your teachers.  Yeah.  They hung out for a half hour and then one teacher goes off and plays with them.  Uh-oh.  And then that teacher brings him back into the, uh, where we were, which was all in  one big room.  He was just off to the side.  But he's holding my son's hand to bring him back to us.  He?  Yeah, we had a long discussion about that.  I don't want any fucking teacher holding my kid's hand. 
[00:43:30]  Exactly.  Because I don't want, I don't want him getting comfortable with strangers holding his hand.  Exactly.  I thought that was weird.  That is weird.  Did you say something?  Not yet.  Oh, man.  No, but we discussed it because I thought that was a little strange.  Yeah, that isn't good.  I don't think it was because of any funny business.  I, I think they just assumed that was okay.  But I'm like, it's not okay.  We just met you.  You know?  That is very fucking, uh.  Held his hand and walked him back into the, like, our area of the room.  And I'm like, what the fuck is this about?  They're not supposed to take strangers' hands. 
[00:44:00]  No, that's what you're, you're teaching them.  Right?  Exactly.  So now today I gotta go to the school.  And do what?  I don't know.  Color.  Color.  We gotta go to school and check out the school.  You should threaten the teacher.  Touch my kid's hand again and I'll break your neck.  I'm kidding.  And then tonight, I'll kill ya!  And then tonight I gotta go do a dinner.  What do you mean?  What?  Didn't we just go to school?  What do you mean a dinner? 
[00:44:30]  I don't remember my parents ever being at my school taking a look.  Never.  We have to go there and take a look.  Dump you off.  Get the tour.  The first day you cry.  And then.  Pissing eyes.  That's right at 10.30 today.  And then tonight I have to do a dinner at the school.  With who?  I don't know.  Other parents?  Yeah.  Because you're sending them to a better school than we went to.  You're not sending them to just a shitty fucking butt.  At three, I wasn't gonna be in school for three more years.  I'm telling you.  I'm not doing.  I'm telling you.  I'm not doing anything really that special though.  Yeah.  Doesn't matter.  I mean, public schools in Manhattan are rough. 
[00:45:00]  Dude, I didn't go to school until I was six.  I went to kindergarten.  Six?  That was it.  Six.  Wasn't it five?  No, like six.  Seven was what?  First grade?  I don't know.  I think you're a year ahead.  You're very advanced.  Yeah, that must have been it.  I don't know.  Maybe you go in at five and your birthday turns into six before you're out of there.  Yeah, I think you start at five.  Five is kindergarten?  Yes.  I think so.  Well, five to six.  Right?  Yeah, I guess.  Yeah, because April, my birthday, I was in there at six.  But if you said I went in at six, then you could be leaving kindergarten as a young man. 
[00:45:30]  Was I a retard?  Maybe I was a retard.  Retard.  You're a retard.  You're a retard.  But you would never say it to an actual retard.  No.  Say it to fucking idiots.  People, friends.  Just idiots.  My retarded friends.  You got to move out to the suburbs in like a good school district.  You get a good public school, I'm all in.  But Manhattan public schools are a little rough depending on where you live.  I live on the Upper West Side, and the public school has armed guards because there might 
[00:46:00]  be a few projects very nearby.  Armed guards must mean it's safe.  So they line up every day around three.  Armed guards.  Jesus.  Wow.  To make sure everyone goes on their way.  That's good.  Because it's in a good neighborhood.  You should send private, though.  I mean, you can have...  No, you have to in Manhattan.  Most people do what we're doing.  You should send to the best.  You get the money.  It's like fucking public school.  The best is $75,000 a year. 
[00:46:30]  Well, maybe not yet, but...  At this age?  $75,000.  Yes.  What do they do for $75,000 a year?  Nothing.  He's doing the same shit.  Yeah, what's he learning at three and a half?  Not nothing.  $75,000 a year for that?  Yes.  Wow.  Some of his little friends from another program, you know, then you're like, oh, where  are you sending your kid next year?  And they're talking about these schools.  School of Hard Knocks.  And then they like...  That's where I went.  And then these...  I got to keep it a little vague because some of them listen to this show.  But they'll like kind of brag and go, well, I'm sending them to Blah Blah School because 
[00:47:00]  Blah Blah's kids go there.  And it's an A-lister.  And I'm like, gives a fuck.  Wow.  And then we...  How much is that?  $75,000.  $75,000.  $75,000.  $75,000.  $75,000.  For a three and a half year old.  Yeah, that's a lot for a little kids.  That's every year.  That's not one and done.  Yeah, yeah.  You're putting yourself into a place where now you're writing a check for $75,000 a year?  But that's what you're supposed to do.  What are you talking about?  If you could swing it.  No.  That's what you're supposed to do.  It gets to a point where you're paying the $75,000 so now you can tell people at the playground 
[00:47:30]  that your kid is going to this school.  It's like the Harvard of fucking kindergarten.  Isn't that what you want though?  No, I don't give a fuck.  I just want them to get a good education.  Yeah.  I don't need that status shit.  Your son made poopies.  Like butlers walking around and shit.  No, I don't need that status shit.  I want to make sure he gets a good education, but not to the point where, you know, I have  to pay this much so I can brag and tell him he went to this thing.  Who cares? 
[00:48:00]  We picked a nice fine place, but it's 20 G's a year.  What's the makeup?  Does it look good?  Yeah.  Looks good?  Yeah.  That's where I'm all in.  It's a good way to judge.  That's where I'm all in with you, buddy.  I hear you.  You just take it a little too far.  Of course I do.  I keep it between the lines.  My racism is between the lines.  Between the lines.  I don't go off the road ever.  All right.  You lunatic.  I got to agree with you on that one.  All right.  I'm not stupid. 
[00:48:30]  How much is like, not kindergarten, but how much is like first, second, like those grades?  I don't know.  I really don't know.  That gets up there now.  I think he stays in this school for two years, and then you got to figure out a kindergarten program.  That's going to be like 19 years of school.  Crazy.  Yeah.  To pay every year.  Yeah.  I got a sailboat to buy.  I don't think I'm going to buy a sailboat now.  Not if you got to pay for 19 years of school.  Tim Sabian better get this show back on track, because now I got to stick around a little  more.  No wonder you're so motivated.  Yeah.  So motivated. 
[00:49:00]  It has nothing to do with Sabian.  School, sailboats.  Crazy.  But now I got to go to the school today, and I got to like take the tour.  I already saw the school.  I guess.  Here's the blocks.  Here's the crayons.  Here's the mats to lay on.  What the fuck?  Nap time.  And then a dinner tonight.  A dinner.  Do you got to pay for the dinner?  I don't know.  It better be on the house for 20 grand.  Hey, I didn't like the steak at the dinner.  I think my kids going to school is going to officially drive me officially insane. 
[00:49:30]  Yeah, because they're like, well, we just want to let you know that we're a no nut slash  seed school.  Oh, oh.  No nuts or seeds.  What happened to the kids back in our day?  Were they dropping?  I guess they just dropped dead.  They just fucking dropped dead.  Or is this peanut allergy a new thing?  What?  Like everyone, everyone I knew just ate peanut butter and jelly sandwiches while we were growing  up.  I don't remember. 
[00:50:00]  What happened to those kids?  I know.  I don't remember any kid doing the chicken on the floor or the fucking, because somebody  unwrapped their peanut butter sandwich.  Do you know of one?  Not a one when I was growing up.  I don't remember one kid having some weird food allergy when we were growing up.  Not one.  Now they sequester the kids at a separate table.  They're right.  That have the allergies.  They fuck it.  Oh, E-Rock's talking.  Certain schools, they'll search the little kids' lunches when they come in.  And if it has anything that another kid can have, they throw it out.  You know why?  Because they got sued once.  There's one fucking lawyer who got school, probably got taken for eight million and said, 
[00:50:30]  You know what?  Let's just throw out the PB&J.  Yeah.  That's all it's about.  Jesus.  That's it?  Yeah, they don't want to get sued.  They don't want a kid having a problem there, and then all of a sudden you're accused of  not providing a safe environment for the child, and you're going to pay for some kid dropping  dead.  I remember chicks peeing their pants.  That's about it.  That's about it.  Yeah.  I don't remember, like, food allergies.  Slighting your head under the seat when she was doing it.  Matter of fact, I'll say it, man.  And Washington Drive School, to this day, had the best peanut butter cookies I've ever 
[00:51:00]  had in my life.  Now peanuts are fucking like guns in schools.  I know.  They just don't like them.  For some reason, it's airborne.  Like, kids can have other allergies, and they don't care, but if you have a peanut or  seed thing, if it's just near them, they get all sick.  Yeah, it's like fucking Syrian gas now.  You can't have a peanut in the fucking cafeteria.  They had more peanut butter cookies coming out of that oven all day long.  You would smell the peanut butter cookies throughout the entire school.  Kids would just be falling over in the hallways.  And I've been looking for that exact peanut butter cookie since. 
[00:51:30]  I can't find it.  It was amazing.  28 Gs is just the entry.  Wait.  Wait for fundraising and all the money they're going to hit you up with.  Oh, boy.  I'm going through the same thing.  My kid spent 140 Gs going.  What?  Hold on a second.  140 Gs.  TJ in New York.  Go ahead.  Oh, the pain.  You have no idea, Opie, what you're in for, my friend.  No idea.  So you're another guy that... 
[00:52:00]  Hold on.  Are you a guy trying to raise kids in this dumb city?  What the fuck was I thinking?  I should have listened to my mom and moved to Long Island.  Oh, Lordy.  So, yeah, 140 grand.  I got twins.  First, it was 35 grand for both of them for the first year of...  Ready for this?  Yeah.  Four-year-old school.  Right.  Four-year-olds.  Right.  So I had to pay for both of them.  I did about 40K in fundraisers.  My company has to sponsor a golf outing every year. 
[00:52:30]  That's another 20 grand.  And then they have what they call soirees.  And you got to give them another $500, $600 per person.  And you got to get a table of 10 to attend the event.  Oh, the big fucking goose and duck soiree.  Soiree.  Hooray.  Whatever you want to call it, it's a disaster.  I think my son is a retard.  Did he hear this?  He thinks his son's a retard.  So you spent 140 Gs and he's no better off. 
[00:53:00]  He's a dud.  He's a dud-a-roo.  My daughter's selling back.  You know, she could do the alphabet.  My son can't even get the fucking seat.  Get the fucking re-car.  He's a fucking re-car.  I don't even know what to do.  So the good thing is my old lady's family is paying for a lot of it because they say the education is so important.  You guys should stay in the city.  The kids will be cultivated.  The culture.  Oh, fuck all that.  You keep paying the fucking bill.  I'll stay in New York City.  Yeah, exactly. 
[00:53:30]  I would love to move to the suburbs.  You got two kids.  You got to.  Yeah.  I mean, I got to figure this shit out.  Yo, Opie, one more thing.  Just, sir, 9-11, you know, tough, tough day.  I was around downtown that day.  I just wanted to say, you know, I remember you guys on the air.  It was just a tough day.  I just remember the friends that I lost.  We made it better.  Yeah.  You guys have a great day, all right?  We helped.  All right, brother.  Yeah, I go right back to that day.  Holy fuck.  I still remember where it counts. 
[00:54:00]  I remember with my hatred of those people.  Yep.  Yes, you must.  Don't give any quarter.  I sit there and watch, and I go, fuck them.  Fuck them still.  Can I take one more kid phone call?  Ooh.  Do you mind?  Sure.  Go ahead.  I take them all the time.  Let's say hi to Steve the therapist.  Steve.  Hi, Opie.  What's happening?  Hey.  You're going to be walking the halls.  I'm serious.  I'm selling candy bars for your kid, because there's going to be a minimum of what's acceptable. 
[00:54:30]  Otherwise, you're buying them yourself.  That's right.  No.  No.  I'm not doing it.  No.  I wrote my check.  That's it.  One and done.  You'll be fundraising.  Fundraising.  I'm not fundraising.  Do I look like a fundraiser?  Yeah.  What am I going to hang outside a fucking Home Depot with a box of candy bars?  No, the next year.  For the basketball team.  No, I got to go to basketball camp.  For the basketball camp.  E-Rock better pick out some interns that know how to sell raffle tickets, my friend. 
[00:55:00]  I'm not doing any of that.  I'm sorry.  Just tell me how much.  I'll just.  Me and Anna, this is where we're similar.  Just tell me how much.  Tell me.  Here's my checkbook.  Throw money at it.  I'll just throw money at it.  Make it go away.  That's right.  What?  Travis, no.  What happened to you?  Oh, Travis knows.  You know this shit, right?  Riley started pre-K yesterday.  How old is she?  She's five?  She's four.  Okay.  Yeah.  It was adorable.  Oh.  And then, you know, we get some forms in her folder when we get home. 
[00:55:30]  One of them is the candy bars.  She has to sell.  We have to sell 52 of them.  And they're not refundable.  What?  So whatever you don't sell.  Holy fuck!  You have to pay for.  How much a candy bar?  A dollar.  What if you just say no?  You can't?  No.  They make you sell candy bars.  They're like, you're...  Yeah.  It's a fucking mob thing.  Yeah, they say give me $52.  What if you're just like, well, I already paid for this school, so I will not be selling  candy bars.  Yeah.  Yeah, give me $52.  So buy some of these, uh, maybe some of your, you know, your friends in show business can 
[00:56:00]  buy some candy bars.  At least it goes, well, I hope you're ready to sell some candy bars at work.  You should just, you should buy them and then just hand them to fat kids in front of  the teacher.  What the fuck?  Wow.  I don't like this involvement thing.  Yeah.  You're just going to stroll by Eric's office every day with the proxy candy bars.  What kind of candy you got?  Eric doesn't like sweets, remember?  Oh, shit.  I'm just going to give him a round of sweet eater.  Yeah, see, you can sell steak floats.  We would go to the bus stop. 
[00:56:30]  What's wrong with that?  We would go to the bus stop and that was it.  We took off, went to school.  I never sold a thing in school.  No.  Well, I did for myself.  I had a little business going.  Like weed.  No, I was the candy man.  Candy is dandy.  Fudgy wudgy bars?  Sam did this too.  No.  Yes, I did.  You get the candy in bulk and then you fucking, you know, jack up the prices.  Oh, the subway guy.  The guys on the subway.  Jesus.  I went to Costco and I would buy candy and like everybody would be fundraising and I'd 
[00:57:00]  just be there in my candy box too.  Like there's no fundraising.  That's what everyone on the subway does now.  Yeah.  Sells candy.  How about carrots?  Who's buying candy in the subway?  You wouldn't buy it?  No.  Ugh.  How about people who need a sweet treat after work?  Fuck that.  Exactly.  Piss on it.  They have a large selection and it's, apparently it's keeping them off the streets and doing  something positive with my time.  Sure it is.  Well, here's the, they all have the same.  Yeah, I've heard that.  Same spiel. 
[00:57:30]  Uh, trucker Merrill says you don't need to send a three-year-old to school.  Well, this is the, this is the quandary.  He goes, he's out of the house for a few hours so he can fucking breathe.  Oh.  Well, I would normally agree with you, trucker Merrill, but I need a break.  It's a $20,000 a year babysitter.  That's exactly it.  So you get the four hours, in my case it'll be about four hours a day.  Mm-hmm.  Where I'm like, ah.  Four hours a day?  Four hours?  For 20 grand, that kid should be like, there for like 16 hours a day. 
[00:58:00]  20 grand isn't a lot for a year though.  Isn't that for the whole year?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'll totally take your kid for four hours a day for 20 grand.  Yeah, yeah, no, 20 grand a year is a lot.  Yeah, I'll do it.  Yeah.  You would do that, right?  Sure, yeah.  You're a kid.  I'll do it for 15.  How many weeks does he go to school?  How many weeks is the school year?  He's a full-time student, man.  September to June or whatever.  Starting, what, next week, I guess.  How many weeks is that roughly?  Like 40 weeks out of the year?  Probably about 40, 42 weeks.  So what's 20 grand in a 40 weeks?  That's like, is that $500 a week?  Oh, man, numbers.  Yuck. 
[00:58:30]  $100 a day.  Am I wrong?  Mm-hmm.  How many a minute?  Well, you just break it down.  Break it down.  $500 a week, right?  I think so.  And then you just buy five weekdays, $100 a day.  Oh, my God.  Not bad for four hours.  $25 an hour.  My son's school.  All right.  Wait.  We got to get into this a little bit because now the phones are lit with the scams these  schools are pulling.  Josh in Philly, go ahead.  What's up, Ope?  How you doing?  Hey.  Yeah, I get this pamphlet in the mail because my son started school before Labor Day, and 
[00:59:00]  it says, if you do not want to participate in his fundraisers for the entire school year...  You are this, and they show a picture of Susan Smith.  They want the parents to send in a $35 check per month just for the parent-teacher association.  Now, this isn't even for my kids' education.  That's right.  This is just for them to go play outside. 
[00:59:30]  This whole thing is a shakedown.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, my God.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  That's a scam.  We're going to Chicago.  Thank you, sir.  Tim in Chicago.  Go ahead.  Hey, what's going on?  I just wanted to make a comment.  Everybody has noticed this van saying $20,000 doesn't seem too bad for a year of schooling  for your three-year-old.  Meanwhile, here in Chicago, I have two children and a Catholic school.  You know, full nine yards, no raffles, none of that stuff through this particular school, 
[01:00:00]  and I'm paying a grand total of $6,800.  In Catholic school?  Yes.  Wow.  For a private Catholic school.  Well, that's expensive for a lot of people, too, you know?  Yeah?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  That's another bill that people don't need.  It's a lot more reasonable than $20,000 plus shakedowns.  Right.  You know, out there on Long Island, we had a pretty good, solid, you know, public school,  so.  Yeah.  New Rochelle.  Yeah, public school system out in the suburbs, you know.  But the religious zealots almost got a hold of the opster. 
[01:00:30]  What?  No.  Oh, yeah.  What do you mean?  Catholic school?  And then they start brainwashing my parents, going, you got to send them to the Catholic  school with all the boys.  You got to send them to an all-boys school.  No, the opster loves the ladies.  That's right.  Opster's got some chickies he's got to talk to.  No, there's some numbers to put up.  Yeah.  The young opster had no fucking game.  No.  I wasn't putting up numbers yet.  You needed to practice stuff.  Right.  But the zealots, man, they got a hold of them.  That religion class leads to fucking some brainwashing. 
[01:01:00]  Next thing you know, I'm walking through this old boys school.  What was it?  St. Anthony's, I think it's called.  Oh, St. Anthony's, yeah.  And they're like, you know, you got to send them here.  I know some people from St. Anthony's.  They were all degenerate.  They were weirdo.  Was it Jersey City or is that Long Island?  No, Long Island had one.  Big, huge Catholic school.  But, man, they got, they, I don't know what the fuck, but they got all brand new shit.  Yeah.  They had nice stuff.  That day.  That's the day they walk people through.  They probably buy shit.  They make all the kids wear it and they bring it back the next day.  I know that's the game. 
[01:01:30]  But they almost got a hold of us.  My mom, you know, thank God, she tapped out.  She's like, no, fuck no.  Fuck that.  No.  The Catholic school guys were always, like, weird.  They were, right?  They were a little weird and, like, really kind of rambunctious.  Right.  And worse as far as doing bad things than the regular public school kids.  Yeah, because if you're not seeing the tits.  Yeah, yeah.  It drives you nuts.  You're fucking starting, you know, losing your mind.  Oh, yeah.  It blows my mind that they're not, like, sending you letters asking for donations. 
[01:02:00]  They're sending you letters that say, now that you've paid your tuition, you also absolutely  have to give us more money.  Mandatory.  Like, we need 35 bucks from you now.  It's like the school is saying, you must allow us to wear our beaks.  Ah, school supplies.  It said I had to buy 50.  Oh, I've heard about this one.  All right.  We're doing this break.  Fuck it.  A couple more.  Go ahead, Jeff.  Because I heard about this as well.  Go ahead. 
[01:02:30]  Yeah, it's ridiculous.  So I get the school list.  And, you know, I just, for my six-year-old, I got a glue stick, a notepad, you know, just  the basic stuff.  And then underneath of it, it says I have to buy 40 glue sticks, 25 notepads, a box of,  like, paper clips, and four or five boxes.  You misread it.  Those are glow sticks.  They're giving your child ecstasy.  Oh.  Molly.  It's a rave.  I have to buy my own kid, you know, the regular stuff, but then I have to buy it for everybody 
[01:03:00]  else.  That's the new thing.  Parents have to buy the school supplies in a lot of these school districts.  Yeah.  We got, like, I mean, she's only in pre-K, but she has a list of supplies.  We need to buy her one roll of paper towels, hand sanitizer.  Like, they don't have that kind of stuff anymore.  Like, you have to provide your own box of tissues.  We didn't have hand sanitizer when we were growing up.  Hand sanitizer?  You know the-  People have washed your hands.  Yeah, you never washed your hands.  No.  What was that?  You'd make duty, and then you'd go back and fucking do your own project. 
[01:03:30]  Start playing with everybody.  Finger paint with its paint and duty.  And you would stick your finger in somebody's mouth because you just didn't know any better?  Hand sanitizer.  What?  But you have to buy the-  I'm not buying school supplies.  I'm not fucking bringing a box of candy bars around.  Yes, you will.  Yes, you will.  That was the rules.  I'll throw the candy bars in the garbage, but I'll make believe my son sold them.  I'm going to go, wow, look.  We did good today.  Look, empty box.  You just buy the box.  Yes.  I have for years. 
[01:04:00]  Begins today, so.  Why don't you try to sell them with a little markup?  A little game for the opster.  Yeah, a dollar for me, a dollar for you.  Old school.  Yeah.  That's what I would do.  I got to take a tour of the school, and then I got to do a dinner.  What's a dinner?  That doesn't make any sense.  Why do you need to know who the fuck the parents are?  What is it, a little get-together?  Like, oh, look, here's all the parents.  It's probably better so you can meet the parents, so you know, like, oh, I'm going to Tim's house.  Like, you know what?  That fucking father was creepy. 
[01:04:30]  No, you're not.  It's better.  This way you don't have to wonder what kind of fucking creeps are lurking around because  you've had dinner with them.  Oh, look.  It's the Ebsons.  They're delightful.  My biggest fear now is I got to be friends with assholes because my kid gets along with  their kid.  How am I going to handle that?  Fine.  Aren't you used to it here?  Yeah, you work with them.  How am I going to handle that?  I know.  Can you imagine someone in your house, and you would never have them in your fucking house,  but because they also have a little kitten that's adorable, you guys got to hang out together. 
[01:05:00]  Playdate with little Beavis?  Right.  Beavis needs a friend.  No.  Sure.  He'll get one.  I'm Beavis's friend.  Screw you, like fucking Art Carney and Harry and Tonto.  I don't know, man.  Yeah.  Wow, you're a-  I liked being a parent when it was just all in our little house.  That's it.  You're a little fucking microcosm.  Now you got to send them out into the world.  Oh, God.  I'm dealing with more assholes. 
[01:05:30]  I've spent my whole life not being around assholes.  Jesus.  Push them all away.  Now you got a deal.  Did you just want to go to private or public school?  Public.  Oh, so that's the same shit you have to do.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, but you picked a good public school.  We have a very-  You do?  Good.  Oh, yeah.  But you picked it, right?  We got it in the lottery.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, you don't get to pick where you go.  Oh, you're one of those lottery people.  No.  No, you go where you are, like, districted for. 
[01:06:00]  Or-  How many schools are in the lottery?  I don't know.  I think you can pick, like, your top five.  And then-  Is there a shitty school in there that you got-  We're scared that you might-  Yeah, the school that-  Yeah, there was a documentary where they showed the lottery.  I forgot the name of it.  It was about schooling in New York City, I believe.  And all these parents in these horrible neighborhoods go into a gymnasium, and they have the lottery 
[01:06:30]  balls in the front, and it was a dream come true for only a few families.  And the rest, they left the auditorium, whatever, crying, knowing they were going into a shitty,  shitty school.  Our district, the school that she-  Was it called The Lottery?  It was, yeah, I saw it too.  It was The Lottery.  Yeah, I liked it a lot.  It was good.  It was a good fucking documentary, The Lottery.  It was really sad, because these-  It's really weird.  These parents are fully aware that their kid, you know, is going to be in a real tough spot  if they go to the horrible public school. 
[01:07:00]  If I lived two blocks north, we would have been districted to, like, a way better school.  Two blocks.  Wow.  Two blocks.  So luckily, because a lot of people in our neighborhood and in surrounding neighborhoods  didn't come back after the hurricane, there were some extra spots in, like, the really  good public school.  So you got a really good one?  Yeah.  I mean, it's very small.  It's like 200 kids, like, in the entire school.  Wow.  And Anthony would really like us.  And good kids?  Yeah, good kids. 
[01:07:30]  I love how everybody's fucking open-minded liberal until it comes to sticking your kid  in a school.  That's right.  Then there's something you just don't want going on.  That's right.  How good are the kids?  Yeah.  Yeah.  These are great kids.  Let's look.  That's nice.  Yeah.  I could tell they're good kids.  That's right.  But everyone wants this better for their kid.  Yeah.  Most people, anyway.  Exactly.  And the lottery shows.  Oh, my God.  Nice, Aryan-looking, blonde-haired kid like little Riley.  Right.  She doesn't have to deal with riffraff.  What would you do if she did get stuck in some horrible sleep? 
[01:08:00]  You'd have to move.  How do you deal with it?  You have to move?  Oh, you have to move.  But in the lottery, a lot of these people are in a situation where they're stuck.  They can't move.  Right.  And then their number isn't called, and then the kids start crying because they know how  important it is.  And then they show the schools where some of these kids do get to go to.  Holy fuck.  Yeah, and there's no guarantee that she'll be there in kindergarten.  What do you mean?  Because she got accepted to pre-K in kindergarten.  He comes to pre-K.  She kind of has a slot, but there's people that can be ahead of her. 
[01:08:30]  Where, like, people, kids that are already in the school that have siblings coming into  the school, they get precedence over her.  Yeah, really?  Yeah.  It's depotism.  Yeah.  It's very weird how they do stuff.  Probably so parents don't have to, you know why?  So parents don't have to split their fucking kids up on parent-teacher night or, you know.  Yeah.  Well, what if she becomes very popular and she has friends?  That's what I'm hoping.  Maybe she can, like, win, you know, a spot in kindergarten because everyone likes her.  Yeah.  No new friends.  Yeah. 
[01:09:00]  Yeah.  Man.  Well, I'm just getting into it.  It's crazy.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  So happy not to worry about that.  Would you go to the school?  I have to go to the school.  I probably would.  I wouldn't want to.  You want to go to the school.  Dude, my parents called me twice as a week.  I haven't called them back.  Would I go to the school?  I don't know.  I'm a terrible family member.  I went to public school.  I went to a school that Anthony would probably deem as bad public school.  Yeah.  I would.  But I went to bad public schools.  My mom was there all the time.  Give me 50 cent.  Of course she was, being the fathers of those bad students. 
[01:09:30]  And later on, I found out it was because she wanted to make sure nobody was there to try  any funny business.  Well, look what happened to you.  Exactly.  You were fucking, you know, you fell into the whole thing.  What whole thing?  Yeah.  Having sex out of your fucking race.  That's what you did.  See what happened there?  That's right.  You even described it in a bad way.  Whatever.  I'm tired of hedging and fucking, that's what you did.  I didn't call you an oil, Derek. 
[01:10:00]  The movie's not called The Lottery.  No?  No.  It's not.  The one I saw, Kevin saw it too.  Kevin in Atlanta.  Yep.  It's called Waiting for Superman.  Yep.  And listen, my kid goes to a charter school here in downtown Atlanta, and you guys know  how crappy those schools are.  What's a charter school?  I heard charter schools are good.  They are, but oh, now let me ask you something.  Would you rather, instead of spending the money, would you volunteer a ton of your time  if your kid could go to a decent school for free? 
[01:10:30]  No!  I have no time as it is.  But you got plenty of money.  I miss the days where I just would wander around New York City because I had eight hours to  kill.  Now if I get an hour, I'm like, holy fuck, this is amazing.  I don't have time anymore.  The whole thing about charter schools is you either go, here in Atlanta, you either pay for  a private school, send your kid to the awful public school, or if you get in the lottery,  which my kid was lucky, he got the ping pong ball, got in the lottery, and then you go 
[01:11:00]  to a charter school, but they do make you volunteer.  They're pretty parent-intensive.  You can't just drop your kid off there, or they'll boot him out and bring him out.  Jesus.  Watch Waiting for Superman, because then the teachers get involved, and they're like, look,  this teacher's an asshole that doesn't give a fuck, and then they show him in the classroom  falling asleep and stuff.  Oh, wow.  It's amazing, but they have tenure, so they can't get rid of the fucking guy, because  they do want to try to make these schools better, but they're going against the system. 
[01:11:30]  Tenure is shit.  It's good if you're expressing ideology or whatever, and you can't be fired for the changing  times of politics.  But some of the guys take advantage of it.  They put their time in, and they know now they can't get fired, so they kind of just  coast.  And the really bad ones in New York City, according to that movie, instead of getting  fired, they'd send him to something called a rubber room, where they'd just sit in a  room and play Sudoku all day.  All right.  I could do a Sudoku puzzle in five minutes, because I guess that's a conversation sometimes  with the haters.  Trust me. 
[01:12:00]  I'd do these in five minutes.  All right.  Thanks, fella.  All right.  Thanks.  Righto.  I know fucking math.  Jesus.  I should have been in a math field.  I'm brilliant at math.  I don't think there's really any money in it.  Yeah, exactly.  You're a fucking millionaire broadcaster.  No, you don't say I should have went into math.  I should have went into math.  That proves that you're lousy at it.  I could have been an actuary.  Exactly.  But when you took those tests in high school, everything said you have to go into science  or math.  Not English. 
[01:12:30]  Yeah, yeah.  None of that.  I continue to be horrible at all that.  My brain is...  I have a math brain.  Math brain?  That's why this is so fucking weird for me.  But I was bored with that shit.  Should have been a scientist.  Mathematics.  God damn it.  Damn.  Waiting for Superman is...  I liked it a lot.  I didn't know what that was about.  I've seen the documentary listed to be recommended.  But it's deeply depressing.  The school system in America has some major, major fucking problems.  I don't have a solution. 
[01:13:00]  I don't have an answer.  Because just bringing it up, people will lose their minds.  You know?  Yeah.  Do you have an answer, Ant?  Oh, I certainly do.  Tail's a giant ship.  What's that?  Yeah.  Exactly.  I'm terrible.  I'm a teacher.  I want to defend schools?  I really am a horrible person.  I know I am, but...  Let's say how to Dan on Long Island.  Dan!  Last call on this subject, Dan.  So make it good. 
[01:13:30]  All right.  Well, in that case, the pressure's not on.  But regarding schools, like, you know what?  There are bad schools, and those tend to be tied to bad neighborhoods.  And there are good schools, which are tied to good neighborhoods.  I mean, I'm not telling you any freaking secrets here.  Amazing.  But, yeah.  But to knock the profession to saying, well, you know, there's a documentary where they  had one dude who was sleeping in the classroom.  Yeah, you know what?  That happens at any job.  I'm sure that people knock off at your job as well.  Yeah, the listeners.  Obviously.  But pretty much... 
[01:14:00]  Well, it wasn't one dude, first of all.  There's some major issues with schooling in America.  You know that.  I agree.  I agree.  And there are people that get tenure, and they do the right thing, and they're still  working hard at their profession and teaching the kids.  But there's also other people that take advantage of the system, just like any other job.  Where I work, I would say, and this is not, you know, propaganda, because I hate most  the people I work for and with, but I'd say about 90% of the teachers are really, really  good, and 10% are kind of, eh. 
[01:14:30]  But I'd say the bigger problem with the parents, because I have been called into the superintendent's  office repeatedly.  My class is too hard.  I have to cut it out or I won't be able to teach some of the courses I teach.  And to me, that's a problem.  When I'm saying I've got to raise my standards for, because I want kids to be ready to go  to college and get jobs, and that's the push they're making now in this country, but  they're doing it in a very bad way.  But isn't that, let me ask you a question, isn't that also your superintendent worried  about how the test scores are going to read and all public, doesn't that even go beyond 
[01:15:00]  parenting and to like them worried about the funding they're going to get?  Yes.  Or test scores and, yeah, yeah, instead of teaching, instead of teaching the kids and  getting their test scores up, they'd rather just knock down the criteria, and that way  it looks better.  The three R's, reading, writing, and Ryerson.  Boo.  No, you guys are right, they'd rather make the test, or even if they're not going to  make the test easier, they're going to curve the test.  Yeah, it's with everything, yeah. 
[01:15:30]  I was a huge fan of the bell curve.  Oh, yeah.  And you got your fucking paper back, and it was like, ah, shit, I got a 62, and then all  of a sudden he did that whole bell curve.  Or graded on a curve.  Did you see that?  And then it was like, okay, a 62 is now an 80.  I'm like, nice.  Thank you very much.  Grade on a curve.  Remember the bell curve?  I don't remember.  They did it when I was in school.  I don't know if they're still doing it now.  The bell curve ruled.  The curve was great.  I remember a good curve.  I loved seeing a 70 go to an 81.  It was awesome.  It ruled. 
[01:16:00]  It did rule.  I got smarter quicker.  Right.  Because all your parents knew was, hey, I got an 80 today.  Yeah.  They don't know about curves.  Thank you, Dan.  Oh, Gene.  Gene Simmons.  Get your season tickets.  It's only 99 bucks because we're family friendly.  You shouldn't have to mortgage your entire house to be able to go to an NFL game.  So arena football is in your face.  Good family entertainment.  Is their team called Kiss?  Smash them out football.  The LA Kiss.  Yeah, he owns an arena football team. 
[01:16:30]  And they changed the name to Kiss?  And all those pundits and the people in the peanut gallery who pick on him because he's an avowed  Christian and proud of it.  He's got horrendous hair.  It really is bad.  You've been close enough in recent years.  Is it a wig, Jim?  No.  And people pick on him.  If he was a Jew or a Muslim and you did that, people would never dare.  But for some reason, if he's a Christian, you're allowed to pick on him.  I think it's the height of lunacy.  And those journalists should be held accountable. 
[01:17:00]  What is he rambling about?  Gene's a fucking language conservative.  He's actually right about this.  Gene's an asshole.  No, he's the fucking god of thunder.  Is he?  That's true.  He certainly is.  He is the god of thunder.  He's trying to assign Tebow as the big headline here.  Is he?  For his arena football league, yeah.  Or team, I should say.  Yeah.  That has nothing to do with publicity at all.  Arena football.  Yeah, he's just always been an advocate for Tim Tebow.  Yes.  It's probably all about, like, merchandising with Gene. 
[01:17:30]  You think so?  It's going to all be about the jerseys.  You can buy the helmet.  You could, yes, yes.  We're selling the helmets, gloves, boots, hats, fucking.  The helmet doubles as an ice bucket.  Yeah.  I wonder if that's why Paul, because I'm interviewing Gene in the Boneyard today.  Paul's not doing radio press.  Oh, he's not.  And I wonder if it's because he doesn't want to talk about the, like, because Gene's more  the merchandising guy than Paul is.  I think Paul, like, they're doing a book, which I think Paul is doing at the signing.  Yes, yes.  Kiss.  It's the, uh, from what? 
[01:18:00]  What year is this?  Oh, yeah.  Nothing to Lose.  Nothing to Lose from 72 to 75.  72 to 75.  Then we're going to do 75 to 78.  Then we're going to do 78 to 80.  Then we're going to do...  Fuck.  Fuck him.  The DVDs they put out were cool.  Were they?  Yeah, the Kissology DVD sets.  Kissology.  And they did, because they did the same thing years to years.  Absolutely.  They read, like, four discs.  They were cool.  And, uh, buy my book.  Kiss my ass.  Fuck you.  Nothing to Lose is such a good book.  You're not over the Gene Simmons thing. 
[01:18:30]  No, he dissed me.  Yeah, he did.  He made you look like a fool.  He dissed me.  Right.  He did make you look like a cuckled radio bitch.  I'm no cuck, you fuck.  I don't know.  He did bitch me out.  He's...  Fuck Gene.  He got you good.  Fuck the God of Thunder.  Hey, language.  We had him on enough over the years.  We're over the whole Kiss thing.  You got it?  Huh?  You got the message from him?  Got it.  Oh, yes.  Loud and queer.  We get it.  I would have Ace on tomorrow. 
[01:19:00]  Oh, Ace was great.  I would have Peter Criss on tomorrow.  Yes, yes, yes.  Gene and Paul today.  And I would have Paul Stanley on, even.  What about Gene Simmons?  No.  Oh.  Yes.  Him and Ron Jeremy just selling stuff together.  Fairies wear boots.  Enough hawking his stuff.  What's that, Sabbath?  Right now.  Oh.  Hawking his wares.  Oh.  Oh, yeah.  I thought it was a Sabbath.  I know.  Do you think when he goes on these, like, morning shows, he has to make sure that there's 
[01:19:30]  lots of counter space in front of him for all the product he's bringing?  Of course.  He's never just got one thing.  He's always got a table full of shit to...  Absolutely.  Now, look what else we've got.  And no one quietly typing next to him.  Yeah.  He puts a stab to that.  When the God of Thunder is talking, everyone in the room is supposed to fucking listen.  They're not supposed to do this.  A peck, peck, peck.  Oh, I remember that.  Who is he talking to, Nicholson and the Shining?  Or if I'm doing this, Gene, when you hear this.  Tick, tick, tick, tick. 
[01:20:00]  Yeah.  I've got to thunder my ass.  Okay.  Whoa.  Explosion.  Yeah.  Someone's car blew up on video.  Oh, the victim needs to kiss coffin.  Yes.  Hey, did you see that documentary we were supposed to interview?  I wanted to interview him.  The FBI thing.  Yeah.  I started watching it, but I had to get on the plane.  How was it?  Yeah, I didn't watch it either.  Okay.  I need to.  We got him tomorrow.  Yeah, yeah.  I'll watch that tonight.  Yeah.  What's his story? 
[01:20:30]  He was a leftist, very, very...  He got involved with Katrina and helping people down there.  Um, and he's talking about the resistance that he met from the government and the police  while he was trying to help.  Oh.  Thank you, buddy.  Let me have it.  Oh, there's nothing to lose.  There's a kiss book.  A kiss book.  Jesus Christ.  This is big.  It is big.  Of course, it's fucking...  It's 500 and...  Oh, it's color!  Yay!  Wait, it's 500 pages and it only covers three years?  Yeah.  That's a fucking book, though, but they're not throwing some cheese dick... 
[01:21:00]  It just shows you how pompous he is.  Well, it's great.  Let me explain what I did...  Give me the book.  ...during the summer of 75.  I'm about 100 pages in, and it's so good, dude.  I have to be honest.  It's a great book.  Is it better than Peter Criss' book?  I have two.  What?  Oh, you only have two?  Yeah, I want to give one away.  I'm not going to throw it in the garbage anyway.  Oh.  Oh.  Thank you, Kenny.  Thank you, Kenny.  I'm making an appearance.  I had to print out some questions.  Ooh.  I want to answer immediately.  Wow. 
[01:21:30]  Yeah.  There's a lot of...  Good for Gene.  But there's a lot of photos.  There's a whole color.  Like, it's not a cheese dick book, man.  That's fucking...  It's a real book.  You're going to get your money's worth.  You think Ace will get any money from the book?  Nope.  No, but him and Peter are in the book, so I don't know...  Of course.  Wow, yay!  More pictures!  Yay!  Way more color pictures!  Oh, look at that.  Yay!  I hope you're all set with your copy.  Yeah, let's put it with the CeeLo book.  Oh.  Remember CeeLo yesterday?  No.  CeeLo.  Someone's trying to start shit on Twitter and saying that... 
[01:22:00]  About what?  ...that I was butthurt because...  What?  ...because...  Because Howard kept them fucking late.  Who cares?  Some radio show, you idiot.  We didn't even want to really interview CeeLo, so it gave us a great excuse to say goodbye.  We were fucking having fun.  Right.  We didn't want to have to deal with that shit.  I mean, Howard's an ass for keeping guests, knowing that there's a lot of other people  that were scheduled to talk to that person, so he is an ass for that.  Yeah.  Especially because he does it all the time, because he doesn't give a fuck. 
[01:22:30]  I understand every once in a while you keep a guest.  But in the end, we didn't need to talk to CeeLo in his pink book.  What were we going to say?  So that Fuck You song, um...  Did you get me flack for that?  That would have been a good question.  Don't give a fuck in the end?  No.  I could interview anybody.  I'm the fucking...  I'll ask anything.  Yeah.  Yeah, you are.  CeeLo, do you ever think of calling yourself D-E-F-G-H-I-J-K-O-L-O?  The O.P. and Anthony Show. 
[01:23:00]  Sirius XM.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  Continues.  What the hell is this?  Lynn.  Lynn.  People are telling me the new album's great. 
[01:23:30]  Yeah?  I wouldn't know.  But I hear it's great.  Might have to take a listen to that.  We got our Metallica invite from the big boss.  Oh, did we?  Yep.  Was it emailed?  Yep.  Oh, let me see if I got it.  Because he finally got my personal email, which sucks.  Does he?  But I have mine.  God damn it.  I better fucking have it.  I was hiding my personal email from the company for a long time, but all of a sudden, in my  inbox is an email from him inviting me to the Metallica show at the Beacon Theater. 
[01:24:00]  What's that?  It's been like a week or so.  What is that?  21.  21, 10 days from today.  Where's mine?  Metallica at the Beacon Theater.  Where the fuck is?  Oh.  Got it?  Wait a minute.  No, I got a Tim Sabian email.  Oh, wow.  Maybe you weren't invited.  Would you three be free to have a meeting on Monday after the show?  Yeah.  Just touching base.  I'm going to reply, fuck no. 
[01:24:30]  What?  We said we would do big boy meetings.  I've had it with this guy already.  We're fucking monopolizing my time.  You at least got to give him a chance.  Yeah, I hear you.  People need to know that we give everyone a chance.  Yes.  Albeit a very slim one.  But we do give him a chance.  We do kind of give him a chance.  So technically, we could say we gave you.  Oh, wait a minute.  Oh.  From Mr. Scott Greenstein, dear Anthony, we are very pleased to announce that Metallica 
[01:25:00]  will play an exclusive private concerto at the historic Apollo Theater for Sirius XM.  The event will take place Saturday, September 21st at 8.30 p.m.  This concert will be broadcast live on a special pop-up channel as part of our Sirius XM family.  I'm part of the family.  We would like to extend a personal invitation to you and a guest to this special concert event.  We look forward to seeing you there.  All my best, Scott.  Well, let me answer that back.  Fuck you.  Kidding, of course.  I got the same email. 
[01:25:30]  Aw.  It just says, dear Opie, instead.  The fuck?  I don't think he personally typed these out.  Well, you got to change a few words around just to make it look like you might have.  Podcast number 17, I think.  People are a little mad because I think we fucked up the numbers.  Yeah.  Oh, no.  I think last week was 17, even though it was 16 or something.  But now this week is 17 for real, I think. 
[01:26:00]  Yeah.  And you requested it, so we put it out there.  Today it's available.  Podcast number 17.  The Opie and Anthony podcast.  Stupid fucking nuts from the Starbucks oatmeal.  See, you're allergic.  You got peanut allergy?  Ah, it's stuck in my throat.  Oh.  You know what's good for that?  All right.  I'm saying it helps.  By the way, I want to point out that my oatmeal is not infused with anything.  It needs to be infused.  There's no, I didn't drizzle any glaze on it.  What?  There's no goodness whatsoever because I'm trying to stay healthy. 
[01:26:30]  My oatmeal was made with water and I threw a few blueberries in there, a superfood, and  the package of nuts that Starbucks gives you.  That's it.  I'll take the food.  No heavy cream, no brown sugar.  No.  Not even the raisins.  No goodies.  That's right.  Sorry at this point, Roland and E-Rock again with my food choice.  You cannot let this go.  Ooh.  Oh, damn.  Oh. 
[01:27:00]  Is almond milk too dangerous for you?  Ooh.  Oh.  Ooh.  Why don't you go in there and tell him that?  I can't even be mad at him.  He just makes me, he just makes me happy.  Does he?  Yes.  Yeah.  He rocks another story, but Roland is just-  Roland's jolly.  He's just-  He is jolly.  When he's beating the shit out of you, it's just fun.  He's just-  I tweeted my dinner last night too, just to show these guys you can eat healthy.  You tweeted your dinner?  Yeah.  Oh yeah, I can't let it go. 
[01:27:30]  Yeah.  And people did notice that there might have been a rub on my salmon.  I said no rub.  I said there was no rub, no sauces.  What was there?  No infusion?  Just salmon?  Yeah, salmon that the neighbor caught out there at the beach house.  Oh.  He just handed me a few salmon fillets.  Yeah.  And they were delicious.  I almost said delish.  Aren't there bones like fucking salmon?  Salmon?  No, not really.  What's-  I can't stand fish where you gotta like worry about choking to death.  Salmon is not-  It's one of those fish that you don't really worry about the bones. 
[01:28:00]  No?  No, man.  I've never had a bone problem with salmon.  I'll give you a bone.  What?  I need a little pesto.  Pesto rub?  It looked like a-  Pesto.  No, it's just like-  Pesto's Italian for pissed on.  I know.  It tastes terrible.  I hate a pesto.  A little sausage.  Pesto.  Do you mean our Italian fans?  Yes.  Hey, you're a pesto.  When we were talking about food yesterday and going after these guys, the one thing me and  I had talked about off air and I thought it was hilarious is like, I don't like a good 
[01:28:30]  noshing.  A nosh.  I hate when you go to a party and people go, hey, you want to do a little noshing?  A nosh.  You want a nosh before dinner?  Is that your dinner?  Yeah.  What's all over your fucking thing?  Is that pesto?  No, it's some kind of like bread crumb thing, but like healthy.  Scrape it off?  Oh, panko.  What is it called?  Panko is very healthy.  What?  Like a panko little crust with-  You know, right?  Yeah.  And it had a little kick to it.  So if I see that on my feet, I go, adios. 
[01:29:00]  Look, no sauce.  Now that plate is very dry.  Bottom of that plate is dry as a bone.  That's right.  No.  Look, that's my table too.  You don't see any condiments laying around to jazz it up.  No salt on the potatoes.  No salt on the potatoes.  I like a good roasted potato.  Those look delicious.  Thank you.  No dip for your asparagus?  No dip.  No infusion.  No glaze.  No sauce.  Nothing.  And then, of course, Roland has a comment and he goes, you know, you add a little bacon  to your asparagus.  Then why eat asparagus at that point? 
[01:29:30]  You wrap it up in bacon.  It's delicious.  I know, but bacon.  Bacon, of course.  I understand what's delicious to the idiots out there.  That's right.  I wrap it in bacon.  I know what delicious is.  I just choose not to eat delicious.  Anything wrapped in bacon can't be good for you.  Right.  It's fine.  It's fine.  Do you still feel like you're getting a vegetable in even though it's wrapped in bacon?  Yeah.  Or if you pull out the bacon and the fat's on the asparagus and you just eat the asparagus.  This guy's got to have a bacon flavor to it. 
[01:30:00]  You know all the tricks.  Yeah.  To get a little goodness in.  To get some of that good bacon-y goodness.  What guy would love to eat like that?  I would love to.  I had to turn down ice cream on the plane last night.  Would you like a vanilla ice cream?  Yes, I would!  But I won't have one.  Really?  I've turned down a sundae every time.  I don't take the sundaes.  Oh, you know what, though?  In a plane, you just got to think.  I'm in a plane.  I could do this.  Dude, I was like that for years.  It's literally if the fucking pilot's toenails were in a fucking Petri dish, I would have eaten them. 
[01:30:30]  Anything I could do to not be plummeting, I was doing.  Right.  But now I'm not really scared to fly anymore, so I fucking stop with the sundaes and the fucking desserts.  I just don't do it.  I can't.  My downfall is ice cream.  You see, I didn't do it last night because I'm all in trying to get back into shape, whatever.  But I'll eat healthy all day, like this dry, boring oatmeal.  Then I'll do a dry, boring fucking-  That is Dollsville.  Yeah, all boring food throughout the day.  Extremely healthy.  Not a hint of, you know, salt or any of that shit. 
[01:31:00]  And then I'll sit down and eat a tub of ice cream.  Yeah.  Yeah, I'll just ruin it.  That wrecks it.  I'll ruin it.  The ice cream is bad, yeah.  I can't stay away from ice cream.  Not if you do the fresh creamery, the fresh ingredients.  You'll be fine.  Just because they say it's-  What?  They say it's fresh.  Well, it's not true.  It's true.  This is what these foodies do.  Yeah.  To justify that they're eating really shitty.  I go to a frozen yogurt place, and I like that they have the calorie counts on and the sugar content.  And some of them are not that. 
[01:31:30]  People are like, oh, it's just as bad as ice cream.  No, it's not.  Because I'm fucking reading the sugar content and the fucking fat content and the calorie,  and it's nowhere near as bad as ice cream in some of those places.  Right, right.  So you get a little bit of that that's actually not bad.  Those are those trick words that they use.  Fresh.  Yeah.  Organic.  Low calorie.  It's still a lot of calories, but it's just lower.  Low fat.  Low fat, but it's still fat.  Well, they got me.  Yeah.  It can't all be-  There has to be some sacrifice.  It can't all be-  The black cherry ice cream, they said fresh, milk, sugar, fresh black cherries, and fresh 
[01:32:00]  vanilla.  I was like, fantastic.  Right.  From my heart.  Do you really think that's healthy, though?  I mean, it's as bad as other things.  Like what, a shotgun pellet?  It's as bad as everything else.  Of course it is.  I said, come on my card.  Of course it is.  Yeah.  I understand, though.  It's like, you know, you want to fucking-  I love to eat bad.  I love it.  I love to fucking-  It's really hard not to.  I want to eat bacon right now.  I'm, you know, and I'm jonesing.  Trust me. 
[01:32:30]  I want to.  I almost had-  Whatever.  No one piece of fuck.  It's hard not to eat that shit, though, man.  It's fucking-  Really hard.  I smell-  Sometimes on the plane, they bake cookies.  Oh, yeah.  And I'm like, I smell cookies baking.  Yeah.  I want to eat them all.  You know what the trick is?  Sit in coach.  They won't even offer you anything.  That's a good point.  I have to put on a few since I got them first.  Yeah, there's no food.  But I don't eat-  I just don't eat them.  I told you, years ago, when I was going to Atlanta to do a gig and a fucking-  I fell asleep and I missed the cookies coming around. 
[01:33:00]  But as soon as, like, I woke up, the guy had just passed me with the cookies.  Did you yell for him?  No, but I kept sitting there hoping he would-  Like, every time he came, I'd be like, ah!  Yeah.  And I finally had to fucking say, can I have a cookie?  And he had to reach up.  Ding!  Ding!  I did, actually.  Can I have a cookie?  I certainly fucking-  You know what it was?  Oh, God.  That cocksucker was hoping I wouldn't mention it and then he could eat my cookie.  Fuck him.  Fuck that.  But then you play games with yourself.  You're like, all right, I'm not going to ask for the cookie.  But if he asks me if I want a cookie, then I'm definitely going to say yes. 
[01:33:30]  This is 2003.  No games.  Ding!  Cookie!  2003?  Yeah, it's when we were off the air.  I was going to Atlanta.  Oh, okay.  And I wanted a cookie.  Oh, well.  Did you have one?  Fucking bet I did.  Did you guys play the E-Rock song yet?  No.  Is there a new E-Rock song?  Oh, God.  Oh, God, is there?  Oh, cool.  Is there more than one?  Yeah.  Have you heard of the E-Rock?  At the beach house.  Sure.  Oh, yeah.  I played it at the beach house. 
[01:34:00]  I have not heard of this.  You played it at-  Yeah, through my phone.  Sean F's?  While E-Rock was there?  Oh, yeah.  To my wife.  That's not nice.  I thought it was very clever.  Sean F knows how to throw a little song together.  He is a songman.  We have two.  What does E-Rock say?  Oh.  We have one from Sean F and one from Sean B.  And if I can be honest, the one from Sean F is quite a bit better.  Do you want to play both or do you want to play just the one?  Both.  I'd want to hear both.  And whatever happened to the song, what does the fox say? 
[01:34:30]  It's already done?  It's already.  It's time.  It's already done.  It's already done?  Can we play the original so people know the reference?  Please.  Or at least to the hook.  It's actually kind of grew on me.  Really?  Yeah, I enjoy it.  It's not that bad.  It's just silly.  Yeah, I wish the fox made a sound that didn't bother me.  Oh, yeah.  17 million views.  17 million.  Wow.  Damn.  They put a lot of work into the video and it's hilarious.  That's a heck of a week.  I wouldn't say it's hilarious.  I found it more enjoyable.  Like, I didn't think it was funny, but I was like, oh, it's kind of cool. 
[01:35:00]  It's catchy as all hell.  Yeah.  It did make me laugh, but I enjoyed it.  And it's ridiculous.  It made me laugh a lot.  Did it?  It's in the silly category.  Yeah.  I won't laugh at that noise.  Bang, bang, bang.  Really?  But I did enjoy it.  I tapped my foot to it.  It's absurd.  Yes, it is.  Hear the crickets?  We'll play just a little bit of the original.  And then we got two versions featuring E-Rod.  You don't like this hand?  Drew, I mean.  Dog goes woof, cat goes mow.  It's ridiculous. 
[01:35:30]  Yeah.  Bird goes tweet and mouse goes squeak.  Cow goes woof, frog goes crow.  And the elephant goes toot.  Dog say quack and fish go blub.  And the seal goes ow, ow, ow.  But there's one sound that no one knows.  What does the fuck say?  I 
[01:36:00]  The old man in the video is creepy as all hell.  It's well done, obviously. 
[01:36:30]  It certainly is.  Why does the seal go, ow?  That's been bothering me.  That's how they do the seal.  Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.  I was thinking about the club over the head.  Oh, well, that too, yeah.  That's why the ow.  Ow, ow, ow, ow.  That's true.  That's what I was thinking.  Instead of my own joke, I suck.  All right, so we got two.  Yeah, Sean B. got his done day of, so he gets a little credit for that.  That's pretty impressive.  Yeah.  So you want to hear Sean? 
[01:37:00]  Well, yesterday we decided we weren't going to play his because it wasn't that great,  and now we're deciding to play it.  Well, Jim would like to hear both.  Let's give it a day in court.  Well, I don't want people, you know, turning off the channel and going to backspin or anything.  Nope, never.  If you don't like this, wait till you hear what's coming next.  That's right.  All right, here's what?  Sean B.  Sean B.  Sean B's version of What Does E-Rock Say?  Okay.  Uh-huh.  What does E-Rock say?  All right, all right, all right.  It writes itself?  Come on, let's do it.  You'd appreciate that, right, E-Rock?  The chick goes, sis. 
[01:37:30]  The fest goes, hey.  And the steed went, yeah, yeah, yeah.  But there's one thing we want to know.  What does E-Rock say?  What does E-Rock say?  Chomp, chomp, chomp, chomp, chomp, chomp, chomp, chomp, chomp, chomp, chomp.  What does your rock say?  Munch, munch, munch, munch, munch, munch, munch. 
[01:38:00]  What does your rock say?  You know what?  What does your rock say?  We weren't fair.  That's good.  That's not bad.  It sounded great on the air.  I don't know where that's coming from.  You know, I think it might be funnier.  It sounds great on the air.  And, yeah, I think it's funnier because he rocks in the room with us. 
[01:38:30]  Yes, that's true, too.  Sean B., very good job.  Yeah.  We changed our mind on your song.  Yeah, that was good.  That was a toe-tapper.  Well, then Sean F., of course, who's a bit obsessed with the E-Rock song.  This is Sean's.  Let me.  Jesus.  Let me just say one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.  He's got about ten of them.  Nine, ten. 
[01:39:00]  This is his 11th E-Rock song.  11th E-Rock song.  All right.  Wow.  This is also called What Does E-Rock Say by Sean F.  Sean F., what is his Twitter again?  Mondo.  Is he the Mondo guy?  Yeah, his SoundCloud.  Mondo 270, I think.  His SoundCloud.  Is that right?  Sean Dash F. Dash One, so you can hear all the songs there.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Okay.  Ant hates blacks. 
[01:39:30]  Jim likes dick.  Ohm stops cakes and Sam's a prick.  Roland's cool.  Travis too.  Sal's a no-good hipster boob.  Gary's gone.  He fucked the show.  Don't let the door hit your bald ass.  But there's a man who moves real slow.  What does E-Rock say?  I'm not, I'm not, I'm not good. 
[01:40:00]  I'm not, I'm not, I'm not good.  I'm not, I'm not, I'm not good.  What does E-Rock say?  I love the garlic butter sauce.  I love the garlic butter sauce.  I love the garlic butter sauce.  What does E-Rock say?  What does E-Rock say?  I don't care.  I'm very lazy.  I don't care.  I'm very lazy.  I don't care.  I'm very lazy.  What does E-Rock say?  Wow, Wade. 
[01:40:30]  That was good.  That's a good one.  That was good.  That's a hit.  Right on, Sean.  E-Rock, did you have a preference?  Yeah, which one did you like better?  Yeah.  Comment, E-Rock?  Mm-hmm.  E-Rock?  Ooh, is he there?  He's there.  He's in there.  Probably doesn't like either.  I'm guessing.  That one sound, I didn't recognize.  A bunch of quotes.  Oh, God.  If he doesn't like either song, then I guess we've got to keep trying until he likes one.  Picks one.  Yeah, I mean, these don't cut the mustard.  I'm starting to think maybe we should play a few more. 
[01:41:00]  Yeah.  That last one was good, though.  And it is Mondo270 on Twitter.  Sean F.  It was well done.  That one sound, I didn't recognize.  Yes, it did.  No, I didn't.  Was it one of the sound bites that E-Rock talked about?  No, it was another sound.  No, it was something else.  I'd have to buzz through that again.  You want to start it over?  Yeah.  It's short.  I honestly did not get all the sounds.  You sure?  From the beginning?  Yeah.  Okay.  What the fudge?  Hmm. 
[01:41:30]  Ant hates blacks.  Jim likes dick.  Ope stops cakes and Sam's a prick.  Roland's cool.  Trav is too.  Sal's a no good hipster boob.  Gary's gone.  He fucked the show.  Don't let the door hit your bald ass.  But there's a man who moves real slow. 
[01:42:00]  What does E-Rock say?  I'm not, I'm not, I'm not good.  I'm not, I'm not, I'm not good.  I'm not, I'm not, I'm not good.  What does E-Rock say?  I love the garlic butter sauce.  I love the garlic butter sauce.  I love the garlic butter sauce.  What does E-Rock say?  That sound.  Oh.  What does E-Rock say?  I don't care.  I'm very lazy.  I don't care.  I'm very lazy.  I don't care. 
[01:42:30]  I'm very lazy.  What does E-Rock say?  Really not fair to use your words against you like that, E-Rock.  Some of that was out of context.  I'm not going to stand for it.  Good.  But you'll accept more entries, won't you?  Well, I mean, until E-Rock's happy, I think that's...  You're a smart one.  Can't get anything past you.  That's right.  Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.  Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.  It was well done.  Ah! 
[01:43:00]  What does E-Rock say?  After hearing it again, I think I figured out what that sound is.  Yeah.  I think it's the sound of a giant elephant.  Oh.  Yeah.  I thought it was a trumpet.  No, I think it's a huge elephant.  I don't understand why you would use a trumpet there.  Right.  He did a good job with, I don't care, I'm lazy.  I don't care, I'm lazy.  There's some really good ones.  Yeah.  Yep.  Sal's got something for the show.  Cool.  Sal does?  Yeah, he ran down and you're all excited.  Oh, you saw that?  Yeah, I did.  Also the reaction when Sal has a cock for himself. 
[01:43:30]  Where is Sal?  Send Sal in, please, with his, uh...  He was so excited.  Well, he ran in.  You're right.  He was out of breath.  Sal?  All excited?  Yeah.  Yeah, he was very excited.  Here he is.  Was that you, Jimmy?  Yeah.  Jimmy.  Sal, what happened?  Why the excitement?  Oh, because, uh, Denny's putting together an awesome thing for the month of October.  Is it a resignation? 
[01:44:00]  No, he's putting together for his own personal, uh, amusement.  Uh, Jingle-tober.  And it's all these radio jingles and he's putting them up on his Facebook and stuff like that just to let everyone know what he's listening to.  That's it.  And you were excited about that.  Yeah.  Because I can't stand Denny.  And hopefully he brings it in and you guys, uh...  Why can't you stand Denny?  What did he do to you? 
[01:44:30]  He just annoys the fuck out of me.  Why?  Aw.  He does.  Nice guy.  He's a nice guy.  I'm not denying that.  He's a legend.  I hate conflict, so I don't think we should have Denny in here.  I don't think we should do this.  Well, Denny does deserve to speak on his behalf.  I don't think it's good.  I mean, I don't have anything currently against Denny.  It's just that he's just generally annoying on a daily basis.  Mm-hmm.  Why?  In what way?  He just, he's always stopping in the office and he's always asking me for shit.  People like that.  If I'm eating breakfast, he asks if he can, like, he asks, like, if he can eat what I'm eating.  Like, literally whatever I'm holding in my hand at that moment in time. 
[01:45:00]  All right, that's weird.  It's fucking weird, yeah.  But he's, you know, he's a fun guy.  He's a good guy to have around the office.  I think so, but Sal Repp...  Get that positive attitude of his.  What's fun about him?  What's he done fun?  And it's a hard drive of hits and radio history and to learn about radio.  That is entertaining, I will admit.  You can always learn.  He's always got a good one-liner.  Ten fucking goose eggs sitting around on a Friday night listening to KLX, dong.  Goose eggs.  We're about to put Jimmy in a bed. 
[01:45:30]  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  You know, Sal, you're not a fan of Denny on the air.  Look at him.  Here he comes.  Look, he's got his cup of joe.  Yep.  He's ready for the day.  Sal reprimands Denny multiple times a week because he doesn't think Denny's behavior with guests that come into SiriusXM is appropriate.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I forgot about that.  Oh, didn't Denny get in trouble?  Denny will speak to guests before you guys even have him.  Like, he'll pop in and start talking, like, shop with guests and stuff like that. 
[01:46:00]  What's wrong with that?  And then he ended up cock-blocking everybody the other day for the Alyssa Milano photo.  How?  Well, I wasn't there for that, but that was an event that happened that I heard about.  Roland probably could have said that.  That's the one I heard about.  What?  The Alyssa Milano thing.  What happened?  Everybody was pissed.  I don't know.  Like, everybody was a little pissed off.  Excuse me, Sal.  What'd you do?  What'd you do?  Alyssa was not going to take pictures with anyone.  Why wasn't she, by the way?  She had to go to a live TV shoot.  Denny pissed her off.  That was a time issue?  Yeah, that was a time issue.  Denny got her all upset.  She's coming back in October. 
[01:46:30]  She's going to get pictures.  You guys just blew this up.  You guys just blew this up.  That doesn't seem like us.  So you said, oh, you weren't even there, and you were, oh, this could be another Zito  and Troy thing.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Well, let's get Troy in here.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  I said, Denny's waiting until October for a picture.  What's the problem?  That's just not a big deal.  You said, well, can you get one in October, right?  Wait, what happened, though?  What do you mean he cock-blocked everyone, Sal?  Eric was there.  Eric should probably explain most of it, or Roland.  Eric, Roland was hell-bent on this for days after. 
[01:47:00]  Yeah.  Eric?  One day.  The next day, he said, hey, Denny, how you doing?  What's going on?  You got any gigs this weekend?  As soon as you left the room, he was talking shit about you.  Wow.  No.  Roland, he'll come right up to me.  Roland's coming right in.  Oh, shit.  Sal's always got some problems with Denny.  It's very strange.  But it's all vague.  Very vague, and it's always somebody else.  He sort of has a story, but he's not sure because it's not his story.  Roland?  Roland, what happened?  What's going on here?  Comment?  No, just like before, after the guest is done, they get their hair makeup, and they go in front of the step and repeat. 
[01:47:30]  Forgetty.  So I see them walking by, old jumping the guns here.  Jumping the guns.  Both of them?  He goes, can you get a picture?  She turned around, looked at her people.  And saw eight guys there.  Yeah.  And saw eight guys, and she goes, no, no, no.  And one pedophile, you.  Who's the pedophile?  Look at his hair.  Yay.  Look at his hair.  Yeah, hold a book.  Boom, pedophile.  Oh, jeez.  My boy, you handed the pink book over, and that makes him a pedophile?  He walks around the park, you go, oh, look, there's a pedophile. 
[01:48:00]  Denny, are you a pedophile?  Of course not.  I didn't think so.  He's not one, but he looks like one.  All right, so what happened?  He asked for a picture, and she looked at her people.  She looked at her people, and then she looked at who, like, there's like eight people, and then she whispered to her people.  They're talking, like, she didn't have time, and she left.  Spencer said that coming down the hall.  He goes, I don't think she's going to have time.  To take eight.  I don't get these celebrities.  That's all.  She had to go to a live TV shoot.  You can't take eight fucking pictures, though.  That's all.  It's not a big deal.  Eric and Roland.  Eight pictures takes, I would say. 
[01:48:30]  Yeah.  A minute.  30 seconds.  And that's it.  30 fucking seconds.  She's coming back in October.  I'll hold the camera for these guys.  I'll take the picture if you want.  Eric and Roland were under the impression that she decided that she didn't have time.  because Denny had jumped the gun and had whatever.  They just supposed that.  They just made that up.  That you wrecked it for everybody, yeah.  He did technically wreck it.  He did.  But we forget that.  You ruined it for everybody, I guess.  But you were annoyed, though.  Of course.  You wanted a picture? 
[01:49:00]  Let me forgive Denny.  Denny, why is Sal coming in here and throwing you under the bus?  That's what Sal does.  Why doesn't he like you?  What's that?  He gave me popcorn yesterday.  I don't know why he doesn't like me.  Okay, if there's anything lying around in the office,  Denny has to come in and say,  Hey, can I have that?  Hey, can I have that?  So I was just like,  Take whatever the fuck you want.  Just don't ask me.  Just leave me alone.  Let me do my thing.  That would be stealing.  I'll just say,  Excuse me.  Are you going to eat that?  I am.  Right.  Yeah.  See, he's asking for Sam's fucking bagel right now.  He's the cheapest. 
[01:49:30]  Wait, you want other people's food?  For real?  No.  If there's an extra bag of popcorn,  I say,  What are you going to do?  You going to have an extra one there?  Are you going to eat that?  Like from diner.  Two o'clock.  You going home?  It's two o'clock in the morning.  Where am I going?  Going home.  Yeah.  You need a light?  Say the words.  Are you a cheapskate?  No, of course not.  Jimmy, he is the cheapest person I know.  Is he a skinflint?  Why do you say that?  Yeah, why do you say that, Sal?  It could be more vagary.  Well, I don't know.  Iraq's got a story about his cheaps.  Denny asks for the papers on a daily basis 
[01:50:00]  because he specifically told me  that he doesn't like paying for the papers.  Why would you pay for newspapers?  They're all over this place.  You've got a thousand of them.  You're going to throw them out.  And then I take them  and I put them in the recycling bin  at the train station.  I recycle them.  What, are you using the papers, Sal?  He wants any free bullshit T-shirt.  We get any stickers, CDs.  Swag.  Everybody likes a little swag.  Yeah, he loves collect the radio stuff.  Like you can't imagine.  And like I said,  he is consistently in the office  asking me or anyone around there  for anything.  Jesus. 
[01:50:30]  Hater.  That's funny.  Yeah, really.  You going to finish that half of the bagel?  I'm going to finish this.  Just sitting there.  If it's sitting there five minutes,  that's the window.  You know, that's cool.  Right, right.  I'd rather he just took it out of the office  and whatever he wanted,  just took it and left the line.  You should, you should,  what you should do  is have a peanut butter bagel  and then put one of your toenails in it.  When he goes,  you want that bagel?  Go, no.  Then he'll beat in your toenail.  That's disgusting.  You wouldn't like that?  No.  Is Sal trying to make a segment for himself here?  Yeah, I don't know.  I think it's failing miserably.  There's nothing here.  There's nothing here. 
[01:51:00]  No, just Denny,  he's always,  he's always been like this  and it's just-  But this started,  because he ran in with that jingle thing  with complete excitement.  This is Sal's deal, though,  because he's done it on the after show  a hundred times.  I've kicked him out more.  He comes in and he's like,  oh, I can't stand so-and-so.  And you're like, why?  And he's like,  well, actually, no,  we're kind of cool.  No, no, I was like,  well, why would you start shit then?  I'm not trying to start shit.  I just told you what,  I just gave you the thing  that Denny was putting together.  That's all.  You're like, oh, I can't stand Denny.  I can't wait for him  to get thrown under the bus.  And then he's like, 
[01:51:30]  well, no, me and him are cool.  I gave him popcorn.  Popcorn.  Then he tries to make something  of the popcorn thing,  but it doesn't really apply.  He came in and asked for popcorn  and then I gave it to him.  Yeah, yeah.  That's all.  I wasn't even trying to bring  the Jingletober thing to the air  as of yet.  He didn't even put it together yet.  What?  You ran in here.  You did traipse in here.  Wow.  Yeah, because it's still September.  Denny should be having that done  in October, right?  No, it's called preparing.  What is that mean?  You're working ahead of time.  Good, Denny.  You're not good on the air, Sal. 
[01:52:00]  I don't try to be good on the air.  You guys call me in.  Ooh.  That is true.  We called you in  because you're excitement level  for something that was so mundane.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You were very excited about it.  Made us go,  we got to get this on the air.  Yeah.  Who gives a fuck  if he does a jingle thing  on his Facebook page?  Can we cut this out of the replay?  Please.  You're not feeling confident  about this segment?  This is not good content.  It's not good content?  No.  Where do we go wrong?  When you listen to Sal.  Oh, shit. 
[01:52:30]  So, Sal,  you think that the jingle...  And you have no respect  for the older guys  in the business, Sal.  He's been around forever  this day.  That's true.  But it doesn't matter.  He's the most irritating person  to work with.  How is he irritating?  Up my ass all fucking day.  Oh.  Then how is he irritating?  He's always in the office,  always asking for shit,  always like,  hey, this, that,  he's got ideas for the show,  then go bring it to the guys then.  Oh, wow.  Paris thought someone  has ideas for the show  and wants to actually,  you know,  bring it to the show.  That's terrible.  That's how foreign ideas  to the show are  when someone brings it.  We think they're sabotaging us. 
[01:53:00]  Denny gets annoyed  at Sal too, though,  because Sal, like,  he fights much more  off the air for some reason  than he does on the air.  It never made any sense to me,  but he talks all kind of shit  off the air.  And he'll get Denny  all pissed off.  And Denny doesn't like,  because Sal doesn't respect Denny.  No.  And Sal's,  like you guys know,  he's a newbie to this  and he has no respect  for Denny's time in the business.  That's terrible.  Why?  Because Denny's been  in the business for years.  Years.  Why not, Sal? 
[01:53:30]  Speak freely here.  He does, like,  an unusual job  for Sirius XM  and you would think  someone with his seniority  would be doing something  a little more  important, important.  Yeah.  I program music channels.  Channels.  Yes, channels.  Okay, that's fine.  If you took a little time  to listen,  maybe you'd learn something  from the gentleman.  You're so right.  You know,  he's got a lot of knowledge  in that head of his.  These gentlemen  always comment  on the music channels.  Well, Sal,  what don't you like  about his programming?  Well, I don't know  about his programming.  I just thought  he'd be doing something  making more executive decisions 
[01:54:00]  this many years  into the business.  Thought maybe he'd be  doing something important,  like maybe taking phone calls  for the show.  Yeah.  Arguing about popcorn.  Arguing about popcorn.  or helping you rock.  Getting pandas upset.  Yeah.  Making some stellar production.  Don't get the panda angry!  I heard there's a Sal song  out there.  Oh, the Sal song is funny. 
[01:54:30]  Yeah?  Yeah.  Isn't that great?  Stupid panda sound.  Where's the Sal song?  You guys talk about it  all the fucking time,  so whatever.  I'm just going to embrace it  at this point.  Where is the Sal song?  Sal's a cunt.  Do we have the Sal song  that even Sal says  is funny?  Uh-oh.  Maybe we can bring this  segment together a little bit.  Yeah.  So far, you're not feeling  good about it?  No.  But that's why we brought him in,  because of the...  Remember when he got mad at me  because I said hi  to David Lee Roth?  Oh, God.  Hey, Dave!  Hey!  David Lee Roth is doing the show. 
[01:55:00]  Uh-huh.  And this is when Sal and Denny  really started fighting.  Oh, boy.  Denny comes in,  and he goes,  he goes,  hey, Dave,  how's it going, blah, blah, blah,  and they exchange  some kind of Long Island story  or something.  And Sal confronts Denny,  and without any irony  or anything like that,  informs Denny  that he is not  to speak to guests.  How would...  Why would you say that?  It's not like I said...  Because I just...  I was always taught...  Hold on.  How Mike?  How Mike?  It's not your place, really.  It's not my place,  but in the event that 
[01:55:30]  Denny said something  the wrong thing  or whatever.  I was always taught  don't speak to the guests  at all before they do the show.  Well, that's you.  Not Denny.  Yeah, but at least  I'm associated with it,  so Denny's just the guy  with some fucking  pedophile-looking dude  who works like that.  Wow!  What business is it of yours  if Denny talks to the guests?  Dave walked in, right?  He was sitting down  having coffee with you guys.  I said, hey, Dave,  I gotta tell you.  He's not even a guest  at that point.  He's doing the show.  Yeah, right.  I go, you did a bit  back in 1988 or something  at the Garden  when Poison opened for you guys.  You came across...  What was I on a tricycle 
[01:56:00]  or a surf?  No, and he went into the whole...  No, dude, it was a surfboard  and it came across.  He was happy  to tell the story?  Exactly.  Basically, that's a story  he could have told on the air,  but it got spoiled beforehand.  No, of course.  And as soon as Denny left,  Dave was like,  who is this fucking guy?  No, he did not say that.  Oh, shit.  He did not say  who's this fucking guy.  He did not.  It's not like I went up to him  and said,  I have all your records.  You have no way  to go from there.  You kind of did, though.  You were, like,  fucking geeking out with him.  Ooh.  Wow.  Enjoyed the big...  It's not your place  to tell anyone 
[01:56:30]  that they shouldn't be.  Even if they shouldn't be  talking to the guests,  it's not your place  to inform them of that.  Sal wants professionalism  on this radio program.  I just didn't want to see  something happen  where he said the wrong thing,  weirded out...  You weirded out Alyssa Milano  just by fucking  taking your high pants up near her.  No, no, no.  Like I said,  she turned around  and there were eight guys  foaming at the mouth  looking for a picture with her.  No, you were the guy  who was foaming at the mouth.  What I'm saying is  Denny could creep out  any human being ever. 
[01:57:00]  So what if he says  the wrong thing  to David Lillier Roth  and then he's like,  you know what,  I'm leaving.  Where does this creeping out  people thing come from?  I like Denny.  I've never thought of him  as a creep.  No, what could he possibly  say that David Lillier Roth?  This gentleman invited me  to his house.  Exactly.  In his house.  His home.  Right?  Where his children sleep.  Where my cats play  with their toys.  That's right.  Do you think he would  have me there  if I creeped out his guests?  Roland, what's going on?  You were DJing.  You were working.  He treated me like family.  That's right.  Get on mic, Roland.  What's going on?  He says hello.  That's all.  It's no biggie, right?  I don't sweat things. 
[01:57:30]  No.  Roland's cool.  It's all you do.  That's due to my weight.  Sal's, I think Sal  was taking it personally  and like, oh,  this is a good opportunity  for me to try to fuck over Denny.  You should have seen  how personally Sal  was taking it  when Denny was putting  his finger in Sal's face  and reminding him,  I don't work for you.  Nice.  Wow.  Denny won't take no shit.  He doesn't.  He doesn't.  It's good.  Denny goes,  I'm going to say hello  to this guest.  I go, all right.  And he drives Sal crazy.  Good for you, Denny.  Don't take no shit 
[01:58:00]  from that guy.  I want to know  what Troy thinks of Denny.  No.  Troy's opinion.  He's fine.  He's busy right now.  Sure.  Yeah.  Is Troy allowed  to write things down  so they could be read  by somebody else on the air?  I don't know.  It doesn't sound like  a good idea.  No.  It probably isn't.  I bet he'd write  something very inflammatory.  Offensive.  Offensive.  Threats.  Read it and just get  thrown off the air.  Sal, is it okay  if I go?  I have some channels  to program.  Are you done with me, Sal?  Oh, wow. 
[01:58:30]  What will you be doing  the rest of the day, Sal?  Sal, what will you be doing  now?  Give me the rest of your day.  As he's programming  music channels.  Section by section,  job by job,  what are you doing  for the rest of this day?  For the rest of today's show,  I'll be on the phones  because the interns  are kind of new  still trying to,  you know,  we don't want to make them  put the wrong thing up on the phone.  We might take one more  phone call today.  Exactly.  Are you trying to say  the hard drive of hits  might have a little  questionable material on it?  History?  No, this pedophile thing. 
[01:59:00]  I mean,  it's just coming from  the hard drive of hits.  Now we know  why he calls it  the hard drive of hits.  Hidden in some  deep, dark file.  Right.  Hidden within a folder  and a folder  and a folder.  I thought it was just  a Gary Glitter song.  Just tag the Gary Glitter song  and it's fucking...  Just doing a little show prep  just trying to stay ahead  of things.  It's like the day  after Jimmy's special aired  on Epix.  I came in and I said,  hey, you guys didn't even see it.  I said, guys,  did you see?  You got to know about that stuff. 
[01:59:30]  I said, it's a great show.  You didn't even see  Jimmy's special?  He didn't watch it.  I don't have TV,  so I would have to  illegally download it.  Is that a hipster thing?  No, because I don't have  money to do that sort of thing.  I try to manage my money.  You got a family  that takes care of you.  Yeah, mom's got it.  No, they don't.  Plus, you got epixhd.com.  I will bet a lot of money  it's a hipster thing.  Just get on a computer  and you can watch it.  No, I would love to watch TV.  Brooklyn people have decided  to get rid of their TVs.  We all know that.  It is a hipster thing.  It's not a hipster thing.  It's a hipster thing.  Of course it is.  I can't afford a fucking cable box,  so I just watch Netflix.  There's just some nice shoes 
[02:00:00]  for somebody who can't afford cable.  That's right.  Oh.  That's a hipster thing.  How much do you know?  These are fucking $60 Adidas shoes.  They're nothing special.  Nice fucking...  You're right.  Anyway, let's listen to this song.  This one's...  Oh, yeah.  You don't like the V-necks?  Will Robinson shirt there.  You found the Sal song?  Oh, yeah.  Let's play the Sal song.  Which...  I think there's two.  Oh.  I don't know.  Which one is it?  The war one was fun.  I heard it was really good.  I honestly did not hear it.  All right.  Let's try it. 
[02:00:30]  Is it this one?  Yeah.  There's lots of things  that I can say.  This ass that works for ONA.  A hipster douchebag.  He might be half a fag.  He can't screen calls.  He's fucking dumb.  Don't give a shit about his drum.  He can't produce.  He lies a ton.  With ladies, he can't cum.  He's so naive.  The shit stains out.  Once tried to be Opie's pal.  He has no balls. 
[02:01:00]  He has no style.  Production skills of a diaper.  No one buys his horse shit.  He thinks he's a hipster.  Sal is a fucking cunt.  That's why my uncle may have mock ties.  But no one believes him.  Sal is a fucking cunt.  Cunt, cunt, cunt, cunt, cunt. 
[02:01:30]  Sal is a fucking cunt.  God.  We should have cut our losses  and just played that song  instead of the 20-minute buildup.  Jesus.  It was a good song.  Danny, any advice for young Sal?  He's not doing well.  He's not a bad guy.  His attitude is not good.  He's not a bad guy.  I try to get along with everyone.  You really do.  Yeah.  But any advice?  Sometimes he's like my best friend  and sometimes he's stabbing me in the back.  Yeah, that's the radio show. 
[02:02:00]  Any advice for Sal?  Sal, just listen to these guys.  These guys got...  Oh, about being at a radio station.  Just do what you got to do  and don't think you're bigger than the show.  There's a lot of guys who work here  who've never played the game.  We've been in radio before.  So just listen to us.  Give me some advice, though.  You're just reiterating everything  we've heard a thousand times.  He's talking to him like he's a moron.  I know.  Just shut up and do what we tell you to do.  I'm never going to listen to anything.  You tell me what you tell me to do, Denny.  What the... 
[02:02:30]  Denny's worked for a lot of big radio shows.  And fired from a lot of big radio shows.  Oh, man.  That's the ultimatum.  You're going to get fired sooner or later.  And that's that.  But like I said earlier,  if you were so experienced  and so fucking knowledgeable,  which I...  Okay, I actually take that back.  You are very knowledgeable about radio.  But why aren't you doing something bigger  than dragging songs into a fucking radio?  Basically, Scott, I don't like it,  but Sal is saying  that you've been around for a while.  Why are you the mayor of Flopville?  Oh. 
[02:03:00]  Mayor.  My time will come.  That's right.  Oh, boy.  I'm even losing faith with Denny now.  You know what?  I'm just happy to have a job.  You do the job of the shuffle.  I'm very happy to have a job, too.  But there are certain things  that you really do.  Human shuffle.  You're the human shuffle.  Let's see.  Let's spend three hours  or just push one button.  Oh.  Poor Denny.  Denny.  I want you to win in this fight with Sal,  but...  But Sal's not having it.  Sal's not having it.  I'm not going to let him bother me. 
[02:03:30]  There you go.  There you go.  I'm not going to let him bother me.  I'm not going to let him bother me.  Just a speckle off the shoulder.  No.  That's true.  That's all.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  Oh, you've decided that  this shitty segment's over?  Oh, great.  Thanks.  Sal said it all.  We should have said it  fucking 20 minutes ago.  Is it okay if I take the papers?  I'm going to go get the papers.  Get the papers.  What a non-segment that was.  You didn't think it was a good segment?  I told you it was a waste.  The guy came running down the hall.  I knew exactly what he was going to do.  Here he goes.  You went flop.  Yeah, we are putting jingles on CD there.  It's like, okay. 
[02:04:00]  Wow, that's earth shattering.  Lots to talk about.  Lots of shattering.  Sal is dull.  Wow, is he dull.  Just a bore.  He made such a mistake, Harry.  Oh, God.  It's just the worst.  He just keeps going.  Hey, pass me the ball.  It drops it.  I know.  Yeah, yeah.  Just every time.  I'm ready, guys.  Put me in coach.  And then, ugh.  He did let us fucking...  Swing and a miss.  He did involve some pseudo-homosexual activity for the gay office.  That's true, but I don't think that was any work for him. 
[02:04:30]  Right.  That was just the fucking day.  It's catharsis.  Day of the week.  Yeah.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  That was catchy.  I want to talk to Joe Cleco, Kev's fucking Roland.  Joe Cleco.  All right, well.  Yeah.  That was supposed to go somewhere.  Yeah.  Supposed to.  Good on the air, Sal.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[02:05:00]  The Sirius XM.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The guys are back from the toilet.  Now, back to our show.  Now, back to our show.  We'll see you next time.  Huh? 
[02:05:30]  Huh?  Huh?  Huh?  Huh?  Huh?  Huh?  Huh?  Huh?  Huh?  Good shit.  Damn.  Love the STP.  STP.  Yep.  Still doing it without Scott Weiland. 
[02:06:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Linkin Park, dude.  I think they're playing Huntington again.  FH?  When last year?  Playing FH Riley's.  Oh, God.  I wish.  I believe they're playing in Huntington very soon.  That's that theater there?  Yep.  It's kind of small.  It's kind of weird.  STP without Scott Weiland.  But I hear the Linkin Park dude is pulling it off, so.  Yeah. 
[02:06:30]  I thought that started out.  I thought that was just a goof, a one and done, but he's had so much fun.  He's like, fuck it, I'll sing for you guys for a while.  Good for him.  Let me ask Troy about that.  Where's, right up there?  Look at him.  He's right there on the other side of the glass.  He's fine.  He's fine where he's at.  Is he even allowed in here when the mics are on?  What if he yells in the door?  No.  No.  Open the door.  Let's see.  Can he call in?  Let's see how, is he allowed in the studio?  No.  No, no.  No?  You sure?  Troy!  Hi!  Troy! 
[02:07:00]  Hi!  Troy!  Troy!  No.  No.  Don't.  There's just no reason to tempt him.  What if he just got a mic and went, hello?  No, no, no, no.  He can't control himself.  Until further notice?  Well, we all know he can't control himself.  Well, that's obvious.  He's a loose cannon.  Oh, boy, is he.  I mean, even you guys waving at him is going to lead to terrible, terrible things.  Terrible things.  Yes.  Jesus.  We were so scared of him that we knew he had to save his job.  Because you were frightened?  Yes.  Yeah, yeah.  It was the only reason we saved his job.  He's totally unpredictable.  Yes, we were very frightened. 
[02:07:30]  He should call in with a voice.  That'd be good.  So we don't even know it's him.  Like the guy in Scream?  And do a really good phone call, like I did for Man Queer.  Oh, wow, that's a really good question.  Oh, great question.  Turd, what do you think of that turd?  I love how he lowers his voice.  Yeah.  Oh, wow, that's a really good question.  And I'm like, yeah, click.  What just happened?  I was just going to baba booey him.  I guess he has a show or something.  So many people like, did you see Man Cow's?  Oh, they keep doing that.  Yeah, did you see his show? 
[02:08:00]  I haven't seen it.  Man Cow's brother's show or something?  I guess.  I did not see it.  Was it History Channel or something?  I'm too busy watching Basketball Wives.  Is that your...  My guilty pleasure?  Your guilty pleasure.  They're fucking ridiculously rich.  Yeah.  And then trying to say how they're independent women.  You're not independent.  No, they've made their money off.  They're walking around with furs and all they have to do is go to lunch and talk shit about  the other fucking Basketball Wives.  That's their whole life.  That's it. 
[02:08:30]  And they're like, oh, I'm a strong woman.  I'm independent.  No, you're not.  Got a good life because you banged a basketball star.  Exactly.  I can't get into those fucking shows.  God.  Well, they might be on in the house and, you know, you take a little peek here and there.  Take a peek.  A little peek.  Although I got caught on the New Jersey Housewives blog site the other night.  Oh, how'd you end up there? 
[02:09:00]  Just passing by the computer?  I got caught.  Passing by your phone?  You're on a blog site?  I got caught.  Why?  Well, there's some things happening and I couldn't wait for next week's episode.  Oh, you want to know?  Yes.  It's like I got caught on a blog site.  A blog site for...  Where they chat.  There's a bit of chatter about the show.  Chatter.  Some chatter.  That's what Man Cow looks like now?  Is that his brother? 
[02:09:30]  Yeah.  First of all, Man Cow looks plastic.  What is his show?  It's called God, Guns, and Automobiles.  That sounds cool.  On the History Channel.  What's wrong with that?  In a world where life, liberty, and the American dream reign supreme lie Mark Muller and his throwback auto dealership, Max Motors.  So his brother has an auto dealership?  An auto dealership, yeah.  And what does that have to do with anything?  Located in the tiny rural town of Butler, Missouri.  Butler. 
[02:10:00]  Butler.  Butler.  Muller makes car deals the old-fashioned way.  Butler.  No trade or sales stunt, no matter how outrageous or controversial, is off the table.  It can help him compete against the big city dealers.  Can we get Sal back in here?  Jesus.  Who cares?  So he's just having Man Cow come in and do his old turd stunts to try to sell cars.  Hey, we gotta sell this car, turd!  Turd. 
[02:10:30]  Drive it into a wall, turd!  Make sure we use the sound effects that don't change.  I love that.  That's so bad.  So bad.  I started mentioning the podcast, and then I forgot to tell the people what the podcast was about this week.  Podcast number 17, officially?  I heard we fucked up with the number last week, Sam Roberts.  Yeah, the number was fucked up.  There was a lot of controversy over the number.  It was a double label.  People were very, very pissed off about that.  Luckily, that has been corrected.  Okay, good.  So this is podcast number 17, the Opie and Anthony podcast. 
[02:11:00]  By request, we put the Happy Days bit from last week on the podcast.  Ah!  This is actually 18.  A Sunday.  After all that, it's 18.  Last week was double labeled as 16.  Well, I got 17 on my sheet.  My sheet is totally incorrect.  All right, so it's number 18, and it's the Racist Happy Days episode.  I'm refusing to lean forward for the guy intern.  Why?  And if he kicked my chair, I would have been very angry, unlike I would have been for Jackie or Sidney. 
[02:11:30]  Well, because...  Remember them?  Yeah.  Did you miss them?  Terribly.  I see that Jackie tweets, hoping that, you know, it's not over, but...  Oh, it's done.  It's done.  It is.  Bye-bye.  She's like, I miss you guys.  Bye-bye, funny girl.  I'm like, okay.  All right.  Yeah.  Great.  I would miss me, too.  Later for you.  Right.  We got a nice bit out of you.  Yeah.  We're going to move on now.  That's it.  However...  Good luck in Rochester.  There may be some good Jackie news.  Oh, yeah?  What?  Maybe she'll come back.  Good morning.  She's allowed to do another internship.  Oh, yeah? 
[02:12:00]  Mm-hmm.  That'd be nice.  She has a ray of sunshine, but...  That'd be good.  Not like the new serious girl intern.  You don't like the new girl intern?  No.  We haven't talked to her.  But she's just very serious.  I talked to her on the air, and she was nice.  I like when a girl has a ray of sunshine around this place.  She's a hard worker, I guess, but...  I guess.  Not very good with social skills.  Every morning, she says hi to me.  Troy's waving at us.  Come on.  Stop waving to him.  Stop.  Try to just get a thumbs up and a smile.  No.  No.  He waved again. 
[02:12:30]  You're tempting him.  What are you talking about?  He's totally unpredictable.  He is a loose cannon.  And if you tempt him by waving, he will go and do something stupid.  Yeah, he will.  Is he still getting dirty looks from everybody that wanted him fired?  Rumor has it that he has gotten a dirty look or two in the hallway.  I hear he can't even go up one floor.  Why?  If he goes up there, because those are where all the fucking people that hate him and wanted  him fired are.  Down here, no one really cares, but up there, oh boy.  He's persona non grata.  Unpredictable he is.  Yes.  What?  They know how unpredictable he is up there. 
[02:13:00]  Yeah.  Can we give Sal a chore today?  Yes.  What can we have him do?  Oh, you just want to give him just a menial task.  No, but I want to see how he handles it.  Gotcha.  Test.  Could he go upstairs?  I've never been upstairs.  See what's up there or something?  You know?  Pull his dick out and run around.  What if Sal went upstairs and has to come back down with the most interesting person  he can find?  Up there? 
[02:13:30]  Yeah.  Yep.  It's fucking impossible.  Well.  What goes on up there?  A lot of paperwork.  A lot of cubicles.  I was up there once.  A lot of cubicles?  A lot of cubicles.  People getting talkings, too.  Is Radio Wizard up there now?  No, he's still transitional.  He's still transitional.  Oh, Club Soda Kenny coming in.  With some news.  Kenny?  What's up, Kenny?  There's a lot of commotion on 37th floor.  Why?  They're doing a two-month carpet replacement project.  What?  That's good. 
[02:14:00]  We can't get a bigger studio, but they're replacing the rugs upstairs.  Are you kidding me?  That's good.  What happened to our request?  We were supposed to get a rug, weren't we?  Yes!  That was part of the thing we wanted.  It's going to take them two months.  Because, you know, they have to break it down in sections.  Oh.  And there's a diagram upstairs.  No.  Really?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  What?  Yeah, there's a diagram and a map of the floor and telling you which sections will be done when.  When are we being done? 
[02:14:30]  Next year.  There'll be money in the budget for the 36th floor next year.  Because after the carpet, they're moving the stairway in the lobby.  Why?  So they can fit more people for a fishbowl audience.  They're moving a staircase?  Are they making the fishbowl bigger?  Okay.  No, they're not making it bigger.  They're just moving the staircase so they can fit people, seat them in the lobby.  How much does that cost to move a staircase?  It's staying there.  But they're just moving the staircase to the other side of the room.  And I think they're going to make the reception desk much smaller. 
[02:15:00]  These guys got money to burn, man.  That is a big desk.  Hey, does anyone...  I see, by the way, they didn't buy that Sirius XM thing that Chris Rock had made up for the movie.  No, the movie company gave it to them as a gift.  It's prominently displayed there.  Upstairs?  Well, you can see it if you look up to the...  Why would you put it upstairs?  Why wouldn't you put it where the studios are and the reception?  It's on a pillar.  Yeah.  Well, maybe it was tired. 
[02:15:30]  Oh, I knew.  I couldn't wait.  Mypillar.com.  Yeah, and speaking of nothing happening in this studio, I noticed that Entertainment Weekly had work done in their studio.  What was done?  They had a counter removed so they could have more room in their studio.  What the fuck's going on?  We wanted some of this removed so we have more room.  You wanted a keyboard removed.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Can we take a little look in their studio? 
[02:16:00]  They don't even say hello to us in the hallway.  They're the unfriendliest people.  Who cares?  Fuck them.  They're fighting to be part of us bashing them.  Yeah, maybe.  Fuck them.  I think Martha had a counter that ran along the side of the wall.  For her rum cakes?  Yes.  And that's the counter that was removed, I believe.  Yeah.  So there's just more floor space.  They've already had construction in there done.  I don't know if it's construction.  The counters are probably on wheels.  That's construction.  Oh.  Maybe they just pulled them out.  What happened to the redesign of this place? 
[02:16:30]  Here comes Travis now.  Can we ever get an official answer?  No, I told you it wasn't going to happen.  I know all that, but.  Oh, this is.  Oh, it's up there.  So you can see it.  The Sirius XM thing.  They didn't like it, huh?  You can see it way.  They didn't like it.  Okay.  Whatever.  I could give a shit.  Yeah, they're redesigning the lobby to be, like, very minimal, so you can fit people.  Like, there's open space.  Maybe they want a pool table to go with the ping pong table.  Yeah, the other day I'm hearing, I look over and there's people playing ping pong in the fucking lobby. 
[02:17:00]  I don't know what that's all about.  And there's a Sirius XM ping pong table.  It's for morale.  What?  Is that what it is?  You know what helps morale?  Getting our studio returned.  More moolah.  Yes.  Yeah, a few more bucks.  Uh-oh.  Roll it.  What do you got?  That's it?  Roll it.  Did you just take that from upstairs?  Yeah, bring it back.  37th floor refresh carpet phasing plan.  Phase one through seven.  That's a lot of carpet to replace. 
[02:17:30]  Look at phase one.  Yeah.  Whatever happened to...  All right, we're getting the carpets done today.  That's it.  There's seven phases.  When does it start?  September 3rd.  Yeah, it already started.  And it ends October 21st?  When does our fucking shit happen?  Phase five looks a little chintzy.  Why?  Where's phase five?  Looks like they're not doing much for phase five.  Oh.  That's the fucking...  Jesus.  Yeah, they're replacing the carpet upstairs. 
[02:18:00]  Fresh new carpet.  Doesn't that take a weekend?  No, it takes two months.  Because they've got to move everything out of the way, and, you know, it's a whole to-do.  Is it a to-do?  I wouldn't know.  Phase seven.  There's seven phases.  Yeah.  God damn.  That's all you need to know about the work environment.  You know how much fucking money they like?  No shit.  That's a lot of fucking money right there.  Yep.  Can we get this counter fixed?  For brass.  No.  Look at our fucking rugs in here. 
[02:18:30]  They're terrible.  Ugh.  If a carpet job takes seven phases, how much do you think that costs?  Seven weeks of carpeting.  Million a phase.  At this place.  I have no idea.  How about just the dust and dirt on this counter?  We're having our first big boy meeting Monday, so let's keep it positive.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's true.  Do you have a chore for Sal?  This counter stinks.  You gave up on that already?  This giant fucking counter.  Then again, I don't want to be all close together and just turn and look at each other. 
[02:19:00]  Hi, how are all they are?  Okay.  No, just cool.  How do you get old?  I just want to shave some shit down.  It's a delicate balance, because then you're going to complain that you don't have enough room  for your stuff.  Yeah, that's true.  What stuff do I have?  All this stuff.  What's that shit in the middle?  How about we do something there?  Can't we put a pole there or something?  What do you want in the middle?  I said, just move this.  This giant thing.  We've been through this so many times.  They took down your notes.  What more do you want?  They did take down the notes. 
[02:19:30]  They bamboozled us into fucking having a little bit of hope.  You had to stay an extra 10 minutes.  I know.  For nothing.  Yeah.  We're still stuck in the mud, but.  But you're optimistic.  Well, we got the guy with the tow truck, so hopefully he's going to get us out of the  mud.  You're hoping he's got all the chains that he needs?  I'm hoping, yes.  What are those two keyboards over there?  Those are the ones that used to be in the middle of the table.  So they moved them over there.  They just threw them over the side.  Yeah.  They're hoping like a little out of your eyesight.  What's the obsession with the keyboards? 
[02:20:00]  I don't know.  Why are they over there now?  Well, yeah.  Somebody just came in and threw them against the wall.  Yeah.  And said, oh, okay.  All done.  All clean.  Aye, aye, aye.  It's like how kids clean their rooms.  Yeah.  Just throw everything in the closet.  Sure.  Yay.  Then you go in there and you clean up together.  Oh, look.  Your underpants are dirty.  Well, we're cleaning.  Take them off.  You know where that massive phone is that used to be in the middle of the table?  Where?  Not under Eric's desk in the other room. 
[02:20:30]  Why?  They just...  I don't know.  Hey, there it is.  They just chucked it under his desk.  Is it attached to anything?  No.  It's just sitting here collecting dust.  Throw it away.  It's a phone that's at least 10 years old.  Just throw it away.  Get rid of it.  All right.  Podcast number 18.  Opie and Anthony.  It's on our Facebook page.  The links to the podcast.  Not yet.  Opie and Anthony on Facebook.  Facebook number 18 is the Happy Days bit from last week. 
[02:21:00]  The Racist Happy Days where they were tackling some race issues.  Yes.  And we watched the show and had a few comments.  We certainly did.  A few comments.  People really, really liked that hour of radio.  That was fun.  We said, fuck it.  Let's put it on the podcast this week.  So go get it, please.  A little mystery science theater thing.  And spread the word.  I'm hearing more and more from people that just can't afford the service anymore, but they want to still listen to us.  This is a great way to do that.  Oh, perfect.  You get an hour podcast every week.  So please let people know.  We got a podcast out there. 
[02:21:30]  Okay?  Right, right.  Right-io.  What do you guys think of the new iPhone?  I don't know.  Apparently the stock isn't reacting well.  Well, no, it's good.  What you really want with the new iPhone is the gold color.  That's very important.  Well, isn't that the lower level one?  No, that's the higher level one.  Yeah.  What's the lower level one?  Gold trim.  Stock is down $21.45 in pre-market.  Because the guy's a fucking twat.  Pre-hiccup de pre.  The guy running is a twat.  Tim Cook. 
[02:22:00]  He's a twat.  Have you met him?  I don't need to.  I've watched what happened with the stock.  He's a dumb fuck.  I don't know what they're supposed to do as a company, though, at this point.  Stop making lateral shit movements.  No, no, I know.  And you can't keep that forever.  They've run out of shit, I think.  But they're fucking...  They got so fucking greedy with nickel and diming and cocksucking us.  We're going to put a flash.  Here's one megapixel.  Really, douches?  That's the upgrade?  Like, they fucking took slowly rolling out your shit, which was smart business. 
[02:22:30]  And they got so fucking greedy with it and so fucking cunty and possessive that everybody else rushed along.  And now nothing about the iPhone seems that special.  There's nothing exciting with this announcement.  There's nothing exciting about the...  No one gives a fuck.  But there's nothing exciting about the 4S announcement, either.  Probably right.  Two years ago.  We'll cut a camera on the new one.  Because it's all about the cameras now.  It's a better camera.  They improved the camera significantly.  Everyone wants a really good camera on their phone because they finally have made the switch 
[02:23:00]  where you're not walking around with a dumb camera.  They added magic to it and pixie dust.  Like, they could have done that last time, though.  So now that they're...  Then what would they do this time?  Exactly.  Thank you.  No, but I'm saying if they give you the best...  But that's how businesses survive.  I don't like it, but that's what they have to do.  If they give you the absolute best camera this year and then they come to you next year  and say, we don't have anything for you, I'm sorry.  Then you're going to be like, oh, why didn't they come out with a new one?  And they have to...  But again, don't fucking...  Don't cut up an apple into 20 pieces and tell me I'm getting 20 fucking apples. 
[02:23:30]  I shouldn't have used that fruit.  But that's why the stock is fucking shitting.  But technology gets better every year and they put...  And cheaper.  Says you.  And cheaper.  Yes, it does.  The problem, or Apple's problem, is giving you better quality items and never raising  the price.  Oh.  Yeah.  Wow.  So they can't give you...  They probably cannot give you the absolute best thing that you want right now without  saying, by the way, it's going to cost you an extra $100.  Of course they can. 
[02:24:00]  I mean, they could do better.  You don't think they could have put a flash on the fucking first iPhone?  I'm not talking about the first iPhone.  But I am.  I'm saying that's how they've done this.  They've done this since that.  And when there was no option, the flash coming was, wow, here comes the flash.  But they're playing it the same way.  And now each jump up.  You're like, who gives a fuck?  So instead of obsessing over the iPhone, I'm thinking about stock price.  Fucking how about you go into the fucking Apple TV or all this other shit that we've  been hearing about that they're not doing?  Well, I mean...  Yeah, they are doing it.  They're working on it.  They're doing it.  There's no excitement.  There's no excitement. 
[02:24:30]  They're working on it.  They're not conjuring up excitement like they used to.  But what else can you do with a phone?  Look...  Of course there's not going to be any more excitement.  We're not the fucking innovators for their phone.  Maybe not the phone, but something else.  So I can't say what they should do, but they should do something that's exciting.  But do you really want them to release something that's not ready?  Yes.  So how about instead of fucking obsessing over these little dumb details on the phone,  and how do we jack off customers to add fucking nothing?  How about they work on that shit?  And it would be right.  I'm pretty sure they have different divisions working on different things. 
[02:25:00]  I don't think the iPhone division is working on the Apple TV.  Maybe not.  But the priorities of the company do go into it.  Yeah, but that's what makes Apple different than these other technology companies that  you don't...  Usually, I mean, aside from a few exceptions...  Fucking Apple fanboys.  You don't...  Both of you.  I'm just thinking...  I love Apple.  But you don't hear Apple putting something out and then a whole bunch of people complaining  about it.  When Apple...  When you hear about it, the first time you officially hear about it, it works.  I wanted a bigger screen.  Yeah.  I wanted a Samsung text screen.  They never... 
[02:25:30]  But why...  But Samsung already has the biggest...  Exactly.  So why are they working on it?  Because then you're going to complain that they change the phone every year and you can't  keep up.  No.  This phone...  I'm not saying you personally.  And contracts are for two years.  Yeah, contracts are two years.  I've had this phone for over a year with the big phone.  It's not a wise decision to change the phone dramatically year after year because most contracts  go for two years.  So people that have the five, most people, not like you guys that, you know...  Can afford to buy a phone every year.  Most people only buy a phone every two years. 
[02:26:00]  So you don't want, you know, something magically and amazing happening every year because...  If what you're saying is correct, and you are making sense, why was there...  And I understand stock changes, but they went down to a 400...  They almost lost 50% of the stock price.  Like from seven something, which is probably overpriced, to four...  Like they lost...  I bought it at 390, like a dummy.  Like I could have bought it at fucking 100.  And then they...  Literally this cunt almost knocked it from seven something back down to what I bought it 
[02:26:30]  at.  I think there's a big difference.  Like he's not Steve Jobs.  No.  And Steve Jobs was good.  You're right about that.  Because Steve Jobs...  Stock would have went down with Steve Jobs as well.  Sure, it might have went down to this level.  Not to this level.  Maybe not to this level, but it...  Because everyone caught up finally.  Steve Jobs was good at presenting something that wasn't that big of a difference and making  it seem like it was magic.  But not a big enough difference to make it...  This is...  They caught up.  Big screen.  And I understand that's going to happen.  You can't keep reinventing.  I'm not saying that they should be fucking having a phone. 
[02:27:00]  And they're working on like the fingerprint thing, which I think is kind of cool.  But I think that they fucking got so cocky and so arrogant as a company.  And that's what fucked them the first time, by the way.  The reason Windows is in 80% of the world's computers is because Apple was fucking arrogant  and wouldn't want their fucking...  They don't want their shit working with anybody else.  They wouldn't give licensing or whatever.  And you know what happened?  Windows went, fuck you, and they're in 80% of the world's computers.  So that same fucking arrogance is what they're doing with this.  And I love Apple.  I love them.  Move on to another company.  Yeah. 
[02:27:30]  No, I mean, because again, I still do...  I love myself.  Because they make the best products.  I don't know.  People are saying the Windows phone blows away the Apple phone.  Well, yeah, because it's new.  Yeah, you're going to...  Of course, you're going to talk to people who...  But again, that arrogance, that loss...  They should have had...  Windows never should have had the opportunity to do what they did.  Well, here's the thing.  You're dealing with operating systems.  And Apple has one phone.  Windows phones and Android phones have hundreds and hundreds of phones.  So, of course, there's always going to be a new Android phone that comes out next month 
[02:28:00]  where Apple updates once a year.  And Android and Windows are operating systems that can be on any phone you want.  Nice.  You know?  So, it's really an unfair comparison to be like, oh, well, this phone is better than the iPhone.  Well, of course it is.  Samsung Galaxy.  Because they can put out phones...  Well, then Apple should account for that.  I'm still on the S2.  Then Apple should account for that and stop fucking adding gold rim.  Like, that's a...  What do you want to do and put out a new phone every month?  Why'd they make...  Okay, when they made the screen bigger, why did they make it fucking this length instead of making it the size of old phone? 
[02:28:30]  You can hold it with one hand.  I can hold my hand with my hands.  I can hold my phone with my hands.  We got little baby hands.  If they're going to do that eventually, why'd they do this first?  When they released that, their reasoning was, we wanted you to be able to touch the entire screen with your thumb.  But they're not going to want that when they release that size?  I don't know.  I don't know if they're going to release a six-inch phone.  I know that they're working on one.  And I know that there's six-inch phones that are out in the wild, like, being tested.  So, they could have released it, but they just wanted to stick you with this first.  They could have, but they're, like I said, there's always an incremental update between new phones. 
[02:29:00]  There's five, and there's the 5S.  And most people are not buying a new phone every year.  Yeah.  Like, why would you put out something incredible every year when most people are on two-year contracts?  Because they wanted to fucking eke it out.  They want to eke out every single...  And again, maybe I would do the same thing, but the stock price proves that that was not the right way to do it.  Because something they miscalculated.  I mean, if jobs dying hurt, but they miscalculated something.  Damn 22 bucks today.  They miscalculated.  Before the market even opens. 
[02:29:30]  You've got to watch that thing plummet.  They fucking miscalculated.  And it's the same thing that hurt them years ago.  That's what's driving me crazy.  I'm not disagreeing with that.  Let's miscalculate.  My only point is that I think, you know, there's a reason for everything that they do.  And that's why, you know, when the iPad is the absolute best tablet on the market for the price...  And the same thing that hurt them is the same thing that helped them.  I mean, the reason their stock is so high and the iPhone is so successful is because they were the only ones that could do it.  So, I mean, you could say it hurt them, and you could also say it helped them. 
[02:30:00]  Don't forget the deal with China, people.  And what's up with China?  They do a big deal with China.  They've got a huge deal coming down the pipe.  But China, watch out.  Let's go to an expert.  He's one of the thousand people that work in an Apple store.  His name is Jordan.  Hi, Jordan.  What's up, guys?  Big fan.  Hi.  One-time listener.  Thank you.  So, yeah, I've been working at the Apple store for six years.  Yeah, I've been working at the Apple store for six years, and it's kind of, like, bittersweet because I agree with most of the shit you guys are saying. 
[02:30:30]  I mean, it's definitely a letdown.  A lot of times nowadays, as it was, you know, as opposed to six years ago, it was a lot more exciting.  People actually gave a shit about the stuff we made and used.  Now it's like, oh, I have money.  I have an Apple product, and that's it.  Nobody knows how to fucking use our products.  They come in, you know.  And the only thing I'd say is the big difference between us and everybody else.  Everyone hates us but the Genius Bar, man.  Like, you can't go to a Windows Phone store and get something fixed without, you know, having to pay a million dollars.  Well, that's true.  Terrific.  Then fuck the Windows Phone. 
[02:31:00]  Believe me, I'm not a Windows Phone guy.  No.  You can Windows Phone, you can fucking, while you're talking about it, I hope you get hit by a fucking drunk driver.  Exactly.  And, you know, like, the media builds it up, too.  Like, everybody has these events that Apple has where they unveil new products.  But the media, you know, makes it out.  Apple, here it comes, you know?  Yeah.  Yeah.  The reason the stock went down was because they thought they were going to announce the China deal.  The China deal?  Yes.  What's the China deal?  They were very disappointed they didn't announce the China deal.  They've been eating on paper plates for a long time at Apple. 
[02:31:30]  Not fucking Apple.  That's why the stock went down.  China.  Oh, good.  Apple is a buying opportunity right now, people.  Oh.  Yeah?  Yep.  Because wait until they announce that China deal.  That's right.  I miss stock market Jimmy.  Boardroom Jimmy?  What was it called?  Boardroom Jimmy?  Boardroom Jimmy?  Oh, it was boardroom Jimmy.  He was very short-lived.  Yeah, he was.  He was in the linear.  Jordan, thank you.  Very angry.  Hey, thanks, guys.  Take care.  That was terrific.  What, um, yeah, what are they working on with the TVs?  They've been working on Apple TV for a long time. 
[02:32:00]  If they release a watch, I'm going to fucking, what are you going to do with that?  E-mail, send.  I know.  That is a shit proposition.  I can't wait to replay this.  You just said that you want them to innovate, and then...  But not that.  That's a fucking...  Not a fucking Star Trek watch.  What, am I going to type with my right hand?  I can't wait to replay this.  Right, you put it next...  It's going to be all about the watches another year.  You put it next to the iPad.  Maybe two years.  I made a mistake with the iPad.  I'm telling you, somehow, we're all going to be wearing watches again. 
[02:32:30]  I'm telling you.  Yeah, yes.  It depends on what they do.  A little Apple watch.  Yeah.  I can't...  Look, you didn't know that you needed an iPhone or an iPad until they came out with it.  So, right now, you can say, yeah, I don't need an iPad.  The iPad seemed like the dumbest thing ever, and it rules.  I watch on the toilet.  I'm watching The Sopranos, and I'm like, I have a fucking TV on the toilet.  It's a TV, yeah, for the shitter.  Wherever you want to go.  I'm holding a flat little piece of paper TV on the toilet, and I'm fucking complaining.  It's magic.  And then I realize I'm shitting coming to the toilet.  That's why I'm complaining. 
[02:33:00]  And it keeps the kids from yapping.  Yeah.  But I think...  I can't see it, but I'm telling you, we're all going to be wearing watches.  Maybe you'll have something we missed.  I hope you're right.  Like, I don't see...  Like, right now, I'm with Jim going, like, why would I want a Dick Tracy iWatch?  Right, Dick.  But, you know, why would I have wanted an iPhone or an iPad?  But is the screen going to be...  How is it...  It's going to be a little thing.  You can...  So far, the ones that we have out, the prototypes, you can send and receive an email or hit a certain  thing to pick up a phone.  It's probably like a fucking Bluetooth watch.  It is a Bluetooth. 
[02:33:30]  You answer it, boop!  Hello, I'm talking into my wrist like I'm guarding a senator.  Fucking dog shit.  I'm back to...  Fuck that watch.  Hit its ass.  I'm telling you, that watch is going to stink.  Apple stocks should be $1.90 after that watch comes out.  They'll look at the iWatch.  You can swipe.  Don't forget about the China deal.  China deal is coming around.  That's not a technological...  A lot of people thought it was going to be announced.  It was not.  Nope.  That's right.  Galaxy is the number one phone for Android. 
[02:34:00]  I'm with the winner.  You guys got to get with the winning team.  Galaxy is the number one phone for Android, not the number one phone.  It's the number one phone.  Oh, my mistake.  I don't think so.  Yeah, I'm pretty sure not, but...  Patrick in Minnesota.  Yeah, there's two things I wanted to mention I think you're missing out on.  So iOS 7 is like you use reliable hardware and you have a brand new customer experience.  So it's really going to feel like a brand new phone on the same reliable hardware.  Shut up.  Shut up. 
[02:34:30]  He's right.  Shut your stinking mouth.  It's a completely reinvented software.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Big fucking deal.  Absolutely.  And no other phone can compete with the display and the shadows and the layering they're doing  with the display.  It's amazing.  With the new iPhone?  Yeah.  When do we get that?  It's iOS 7, released September 18th.  The second piece is the A7.  Day after GTA V.  The what?  Yeah.  The A7 chipset in the new phone has the power of a desktop.  It's the first phone with a 64-bit processor. 
[02:35:00]  So I've got to wear a desktop on my wrist or something?  Zach, that's going to be so heavy, sir.  Oh, man.  I don't want a phone that heavy.  How am I going to plug my phone in as I'm walking around?  Right.  That'll be like the Ghostbusters proton packs.  Oh, yeah.  We're on your back.  So what has it been now?  How the fuck is that possible?  It's impossible.  Right now it's an A6.  But that's why it takes time to come out with a phone.  Stop piggybacking what he's saying.  Now, you didn't know that until he said it.  You didn't say anything about bit processors.  Now he's saying it.  Now you know everything.  I knew it was the first 64-bit phone.  Yeah, I knew it. 
[02:35:30]  Exactly.  You didn't say that 10 minutes ago.  He had to say it.  We both knew it.  I can only track so many points.  Now you know everything.  How many bits are the phones now?  32-bit.  And they're going to 64?  Oh, big fucking wolf.  So computers have been trying to get the 64-bit for years,  and it's taken them years and years to get there.  For years.  For years.  So the phone that is now 64-bit is the most powerful phone,  not comparable to any other manufacturer.  Yeah, what is it, like super phone?  What do you do with it that's so powerful? 
[02:36:00]  What does it do?  Think about the potential of it.  You have the power of a desktop on your phone.  And what is that going to do for me?  Oh, it's not the power of a desktop.  What is that going to do for me?  Bullshit.  What is that going to do for me that my phone doesn't do now?  Exactly.  Is it going to get my container of coffee?  Is it going to help those aches and pains?  Everything's going to move a bit quicker.  Yeah?  The future is you can dock your phone  and have your desktop in your pocket.  Yuck.  Yeah, dock your phone.  How about how much memory is going to be on it?  It's the pre.  Are they going to fucking jerk us off of the memory? 
[02:36:30]  Oh, look, here's three megabytes.  Take a picture of a hat.  That's your whole memory.  It's the same memory you've always had.  16, 32, or 64 gigs.  What does this have to do with China?  64 gigs is not enough on your phone?  The China view.  I like lots of stuff on my phone.  Just put it on the cloud.  Fuck the cloud.  I don't fuck with the dog shit cloud.  You don't like the cloud?  No, because they deleted...  What was the one before that?  Before the fucking faggot cloud was the one.  It was .Mac.  Yeah, .Mac.  What was it called?  Me.  Yeah, me.  Dot me.  Whatever, it stunk. 
[02:37:00]  I would fuck...  I lost months worth of phone numbers  because it would fucking...  All of a sudden, I'd pick my phone up.  There'd be no numbers on it.  Oh, it must have sent it to Magic Place.  Oh, we're having problems.  Fuck that.  I don't belong to that dot cloud shit.  No, you don't like that?  Fuck you.  Dot cloud.  Dot cloud.  Fuck you.  Oh, it's in the cloud.  It fucking...  Who is cloud?  I hate cloud.  Everyone loves the cloud.  Yeah, Google Maps was around.  Everyone loves the cloud.  No, but I was losing information on that,  and that's why they shitcanned it.  It wasn't good.  It was not a good product.  No, Steve Jobs admitted that it wasn't good. 
[02:37:30]  So you said that they don't put out fucking bad products.  But then they improved it.  It's not good for them.  And I still hear people losing their shit.  Right.  The reason they came out with the gold foam  is because China loves gold.  They do?  Yes.  It's very lucky in China.  Is this all part of the China deal?  The China deal's coming.  I'm telling you.  These 9-11 Survivor kids are growing up really pretty.  Wow, yeah.  I've got to say, they're reading off the names, I gather.  Oh, my God.  Are you crazy?  It's like the third chick I've seen that's fucking hot.  Well, that's going to be any family. 
[02:38:00]  They're just leaving the ugly ones out.  That's what they do at every event.  Yeah.  Yeah, of course.  She's gorgeous, actually, this one.  Wow.  Man, she needs a shoulder to cry on, right?  Oh, boy.  She is pretty.  Anthony.  What?  That's a good guy right there.  She does.  That's 12 years.  No one cares anymore.  Patrick, I think we're over the iOS 7 thing.  Yeah.  What are you doing?  You're going to hold yourself, Patrick.  He's got one more.  Talked about that hours ago.  What do you have, iOS 7.com and you're pushing it?  Listen to this.  So the reason you enjoy your tablet so much.  Listen to this.  No.  No.  I want to know why I enjoy my tablet. 
[02:38:30]  No.  We would love to listen to this.  I play words with friends.  We're the ones that have to talk.  Right.  It's our show.  Why do I enjoy my tablet so much?  Because it's connected to the cloud.  And if it weren't for a cloud, you wouldn't have any of your streaming content.  So you have to embrace that.  So he just said, go fuck yourself, Jimmy.  No, but I mean, you know what?  In so many words.  How about this?  Maybe he's right.  But I was on the fucking plane last night and the Wi-Fi was awful.  And I do think of Louie's bit about, oh, you're in a chair in the sky.  But you know what?  I'm over that.  I'm in a chair in the sky.  Now how about I fucking get connected to the rest of the world?  Look at this fucking blonde. 
[02:39:00]  Jesus.  Oh, my God.  I'm seeing some of the hottest girls reading off these fucking names.  This is crazy.  Holy.  Look at her.  She's beautiful.  She really is beautiful.  She's lovely.  Damn.  What happened?  She's 12.  No.  All right, iOS 7 guy.  Thank you.  Thanks, guys.  Love your show.  Yeah.  Look at Putin.  He looks like a Bond villain.  He really does.  Have you seen him running around with no shirt on and hunting animals?  All the time.  Yes.  Fucking with his bare hands. 
[02:39:30]  Yeah.  He's riding horses.  He rides a horse without a shirt on like he's fucking Fabio.  There's a leader.  Yeah.  Yes.  I'm sure he's the villain in the next four Tom Cruise movies.  You know, keep it topical.  Right, guys?  Of course.  Look at him.  He's got a knife.  Why is he fishing without a fucking shirt on?  He's got the pole precariously positioned where his dick is.  Yeah.  It's like, hey, ladies, this is what my dick looks like.  He's got a knife.  That's why you do that.  That's why you do that shit.  Yeah.  His manly chest.  Whoa.  That's a man. 
[02:40:00]  Not really.  I'm a man.  You know what kind of man you got to be to fucking alpha male?  The Russian, the country of Russia?  Oh, yeah.  He's now president for 25 years.  I know.  What the fuck?  Putin is a connected guy.  There he is.  Look at him.  Look at him.  He's got a rifle.  He's fucking hunting.  Yeah.  But once again, hey, ladies, this is what my dick looks like.  Oh, jeez.  Nice picture.  What is it?  19 fucking 95?  Yeah.  What's that?  Pixelated.  What's that?  Before the fucking whatever?  Get it out.  Stop taking it.  I got to piss badly. 
[02:40:30]  Can they bring up the next supermodel to read the names of the fucking 9-11?  I don't like that they're showing the fucking buildings burning and shit.  It looks like they're running into it in real time now.  I hate that.  It's fucking depressing.  I don't know why.  It's fucking.  I didn't forget.  Trust me.  No, no, no.  I'm not forgetting.  It's horrible.  No, I'm not forgetting.  I still hate the people that did it.  Why is Putin feeding a horse shirtless?  Because he can.  Because he's like, fuck you, horse.  I'm in charge.  He does everything shirtless?  How are you doing, comrade?  Yeah, he takes his shirt off. 
[02:41:00]  Everything's shirtless, yeah.  And he conquers animals.  What's with the glasses he's wearing?  Looks like the fucking road warrior glasses or some shit.  He's like Bear Grylls.  He is.  Except not giving a fuck.  That's true.  And the horse looks emo.  Yeah, with his hair swiped down.  Emo horse.  They have emo horses in Russia.  His eyes are closed.  Yeah.  He's got sideways bangs.  Very Mustang looking with the fucking mane.  Listening to the Schmitz.  Big long mane.  He is emo.  We'd go to break.  We could do that.  I gather. 
[02:41:30]  I want to ponder the China deal for a little longer here.  Yeah.  See where Apple goes by 930 when the market opens.  It's a great buying opportunity.  Not yet.  I'll wait until it tanks out today.  Yeah.  It could come back by the end of the day, but I'm predicting.  It's now down $23.30.  I'm betting it goes down $40 at the open.  Wow.  It'll be down $40 total.  And then people will buy in, right?  And then you could start buying.  Yeah.  I'll take that bet.  Yeah.  Go ahead.  Yes? 
[02:42:00]  Aren't they getting rid of contracts, too?  Finally?  What?  I mean...  That's the dumbest fucking thing.  Yes.  And no people don't like the contracts.  If you really want me to explain it, I will.  But it might...  You got to pay more, right?  Yeah.  You have to pay more per month.  Maybe Sal could come in and explain it.  And then if you decide...  Really put us to sleep.  If you decide that you want out after a year, you have to pay the balance of whatever your  unsubsidized phone...  What?  ...was.  Do I have a contract?  Yes.  I do?  Yeah.  Why the hell am I buying a phone every year? 
[02:42:30]  Because you're rich.  Yeah.  Nice.  You can do whatever you want.  I just wanted to hear that.  Thanks.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Sirius XM.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Continues.  Sal's been on the phones for an hour now.  So I guess we should take one call. 
[02:43:00]  I guess so.  I don't know what Chris is getting at here.  Let's see what Chris wants.  Chris, what's up, buddy?  Chris.  Chris.  Hello.  Hey, how you guys doing?  Hey, man.  Hey, I was actually...  I was just wondering, is 9-11 funnier than the Boston bombing, or is the Boston bombing  funnier than 9-11?  Why are you saying this?  What do you mean, sir?  I don't know.  I just think there can be some humor in it.  Because you know what?  There's all these soldiers coming back with, you know, blown off limbs and everything. 
[02:43:30]  Yeah, you've got this guy who gets his limbs blown off in the Boston bombing and he gets  a book deal.  What about all these guys coming back, all these people in 9-11 and everything?  I don't get it.  It just pisses me off.  I don't know.  The reason being, here's what I'm guessing, the reason being that the interest would be  in the Boston bombing victims' legs being blown off book deal as opposed to soldiers  is they may feel soldier stories have been told before and people have heard, like, whereas 
[02:44:00]  this is an anomaly for a civilian to have his legs blown off and a terrorist is different  than somebody who goes to...  I mean, that's probably...  Not that it's any better or worse or anything like that, but I mean, if a soldier kind of  knows he's got that, like, chance of being injured, but if you're just, you know, at the  Boston Marathon and you lose your legs, holy shit.  Yeah.  You know, there's kind of a story there.  They're both horrible, obviously.  Right.  But it's more of an anomaly if it happens to a guy that's just hanging out watching a bunch 
[02:44:30]  of dopes run to a finish line.  Right.  And by the way, funnier and stuff, you're an idiot.  Yeah.  Why did you say funnier?  I'm sorry.  You guys, you know, I actually called a few weeks ago and I actually wanted to get a quick  opinion.  Were you a complete dick face back then?  I was.  I was.  I'm sorry.  I have no patience.  No, I do comedy.  I made a Boston bombing joke.  I talked about it and I got ripped into after by a bunch of comedians.  I just think...  What...  Hold on. 
[02:45:00]  What comedians ripped into you for addressing a subject?  That's what I'm saying.  And I'm in Boston, actually, guys.  Maybe it was just a shitty joke, though.  What was the joke?  Yeah, it probably was.  No, I just...  I opened up...  I opened up the show.  I was just...  I literally...  Guys, I'm nine months sober.  I just moved back over from Florida.  I've been trying to get sober.  I just started doing stand-up sober.  It's been...  You're going to do stand-up sober?  That's crazy.  Yeah, you're crazy to do that.  No, I know.  You've got to know you're funny or drunk, right?  No, I don't think I am.  I'm deconstructing Jim's fucking advice show. 
[02:45:30]  Every time I'm listening on the way home to Jim's advice show, we give such great advice  to people.  I'll just be like, no...  I'm not doing my advice show until tomorrow, by the way.  What?  Because I'm interviewing Gene on my Boneyard show.  People depend on it, Jimmy.  Well, tomorrow.  Gene who?  Shallot.  Shallot.  Simmons.  Boo!  So, what are you saying, sir?  Any subjects acceptable?  What was your joke?  What was your Boston bombing joke? 
[02:46:00]  Literally, I literally opened a show with, hey, guys, I haven't been back in Boston.  It must have been about two bombings ago I was back here.  I was going to go to the Boston Marathon, but I heard it cost an arm and a leg.  Be more funny!  Well, honestly, you said two bombings ago, and then you followed it up, and an arm and  a leg is, you know, it doesn't make sense.  I get what you're doing there, but it does, like, you know, it costs an arm and a leg.  It doesn't cost anything to go to the marathon.  Like, nobody thinks that.  If that happened in a retail store, that would be a better joke. 
[02:46:30]  Like, if the bombing happened in a retail store, and they got to want to go to that  store, they charge you an arm and a leg.  Oh, okay, because your arm and a leg got blown off there.  But nobody pays to go watch a marathon.  It's like you're shoehorning an expression into an event.  That's good.  I know you're right.  I just, you know, I just thought, um, I just thought there should be no line, because  all these comedians, man, I mean, it's very quick.  I got a good opener for you.  Put a gun in your mouth.  Pull the fucking trigger. 
[02:47:00]  Well, it might be a better closer, but, and saying there's no line is accurate when it  comes to content.  But that doesn't mean that you don't have to have good jokes.  And it's almost like, it doesn't mean you can just walk up.  But let's just say, uh, what's happened tragically recently?  Let's say, you know, uh, Casey Anthony, you can't just walk up and go, ah, her daughter's  dead.  I'd fuck her body.  Like what?  I like it.  But do you know what I'm saying?  Like, there's still a line in what you're going to say.  That's going to work.  Just, I agree. 
[02:47:30]  It's just, uh, you know, with some of these guys, I just wanted to catch it.  It was kind of an opener to catch the attention of people.  You still need a good joke there.  Well, we got, we got a guy in the line that, uh, fully agrees with you there.  Uh, Chris, let's say hi to John in Virginia.  John, you're on with Chris from Boston.  Hey, Chris.  I wonder what would be funnier if you got your dick blown off or if you got a dick shoved  in your ass.  They'd both be hot.  It would be kind of hot, actually.  I wouldn't mind watching either.  Have a good day, buddy. 
[02:48:00]  All right.  All right.  Well, yeah, just because you, you people have spoken.  You want to open with shocking content sometimes.  That's fine.  But if you're going to say something that's just purposefully, there's a really weird line  we have to walk as comics between being purposefully, um, shitty and addressing harsh content.  There's a way to do it.  But if you just walk up and talk about rape, like I do rape lines in my act still, of course,  but I don't just walk on and go, so this chick was raped.  Better tits look good.  Oh, Hey, I'm challenging, but I'm not challenging anything. 
[02:48:30]  I'm saying something purposefully confrontational with no real good joke there.  Let me ask you this, uh, 12 years ago, right?  9-11.  How, how long do you have to wait before you could start the jokes?  And I'm trying to remember back.  I think we made it almost, uh, a couple, a couple of weeks, maybe.  It all depends on where you put the jokes.  And we weren't joking about it.  We started with the, the songs, the tribute songs that people started doing and we were goofing  on the tribute songs.  And then you slowly start moving in from that point. 
[02:49:00]  But why is it okay two weeks in and not two days in?  I think like what, is there an actual, not an actual, but what is the formula there?  Yeah.  It's the same as it is an emotional feeling that is a, as you just interpret on stage  and you have to be comfortable with it too.  And like, I, it all, like I was on stage at, uh, I want to say the brokerage after 9-11.  Maybe it might've been a year later or whatever, but I was doing my 9-11 material.  And none of it was fuck the victims. 
[02:49:30]  None of it was always bashing the fucking, you know, Islam or whatever.  But there was a woman heckling me and, or being loud or whatever.  And I started to talk to her and I could see somebody at their table, like open their eyes  and like, like kind of pleaded with their eyes for me not to continue with her.  And I could see that there was more there.  Like maybe she lost somebody and not like, so I kind of, I backed off because I sensed that  there was something else there.  Um, I didn't, I didn't deal with her like, fuck her. 
[02:50:00]  She's a heckler.  I was like, ah, there'll never be a time where she can handle this because for her, it's way  too personal.  Right.  And I think that when something like that happens, it's so absolutely personal for everybody.  We, we, we all react to it.  Like they're talking about our relative who died and it takes a little bit of time for  us to be able to separate and go, okay, this is an event.  Um, and now I can look at it as an event as opposed to feeling it.  Like it's my girlfriend that they're showing naked pictures of. 
[02:50:30]  Right.  Right.  But I think that's the time.  I mean, I don't, I don't know how to, I could never win that argument in court as to what's  appropriate.  I just think that we feel it out as a group.  And if the joke is good, you can do it sooner.  And it depends.  Like Colin had a brilliant, you know, he was doing great 9-11 stuff and, uh, you know,  and he could do this pretty soon because you're making fun of people's perception.  Like he did one line where he's going, yeah, I love people.  And how they're going, you know, something told me not to go down there that day.  Uh, yeah, stupid.  The news told you the news.  Like that's a joke you could do very soon because immediately people understand like, 
[02:51:00]  oh yeah, every asshole said that and tried to marry them.  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Like that's a joke that even if people are suffering, they can laugh at the other people.  You know, I'm rambling.  I apologize.  Gilbert Gottfried did.  No, I know.  I remember he was one of the first.  Yeah.  But Gilbert, it does do that.  I mean, it's his thing.  We were talking, he was at the comedy show.  Lost his fucking duck gig.  Yeah.  He said they took a, he said they, I took a flight.  There was a stop over at the Empire State Building.  Yeah.  It's a funny line.  I mean, it was brutal, but it was funny.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[02:51:30]  And, uh, I was talking to the comedy seller probably two weeks ago and he's very conversational.  He doesn't laugh a whole lot.  And we were talking about something and someone getting their fucking head bashed in.  And I just did some line talking to him.  I'm like, yeah, then you jerk off on our corpse.  And he went bananas.  Like, that was what got him.  He was a sick fuck.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It was such a juvenile, violent joke I did just while we were chatting.  You find something over there, Sam?  Okay.  Hopefully it was a lump.  Oh, Jesus. 
[02:52:00]  See, now that's a funny line.  We can laugh at that.  See?  But if Sam had just announced that he had cancer.  Oh, sure.  Serious stock would go up.  But nobody, but that, in a case like that, then I wouldn't have done that joke because it would have been too real.  Right.  Yeah, yeah.  I would have waited a couple of weeks until he was dead and then done lump humor.  Oh, my God.  She's terrible.  We've got a golf course in Wisconsin that's doing a 9-11 discount offer.  What?  $9.11.  Why would you do that?  They said, I had, my feelings changed on this one. 
[02:52:30]  At first, it was like, fuck them.  But it seems like it, what they said last year was to remind people of it.  Nobody mind.  Well, they said, according to them, that last year people kind of felt like, hey, this is, it wasn't, it didn't seem exploitive or whatever it was.  Exploitationist.  But today.  It's self-serving.  Maybe, yeah.  It seems a little self-serving.  It really is.  I mean.  I don't know.  That's, that's, yeah.  I mean, that's to get some attention.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Obama's giving his little speech to the Pentagon. 
[02:53:00]  Is this live?  I guess so, huh?  Yeah, we're so going to bomb Syria.  It's just a matter of time.  Yeah, yeah.  The Putin thing's not going to work.  We, we, we discussed that earlier on the show, I guess.  But.  We're back to some little hotties.  Of those we lost.  Of those we lost.  And make a better world.  When you join the firehouse.  Oh, okay.  He's doing the 9-11 speech.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I guess.  Although maybe he won't attack Syria.  You know what?  Maybe he realized he stuck his dick in the fucking fan.  And now he has a way to, like when two guys are going to fight and they just each want 
[02:53:30]  a way to back out of the room.  Maybe he wants that way to back out of the room without looking like a dick.  No, I understand why he's doing it.  But when it doesn't work, when Putin can't get this done, to our satisfaction, then what?  Yeah.  Then what?  I think Putin will get it done.  I hear it's extremely complicated.  You got to go into some very dangerous areas.  They don't even know exactly how much we're dealing with here.  To try to like inspect.  Right.  Yeah.  I don't think they'll, I don't know.  But the Russians really do have quite a say in that area. 
[02:54:00]  Putin can just say, look, knock your shit off.  Give all your fucking nerve gas to us.  And that's it.  And Putin doesn't want to look bad.  And if he can't get it done, then he kind of looks, then he looks shitty.  And that's fucking bad for Assad.  Yeah.  And then the Russians made the, didn't the Russians make the poison gas even better?  That's what I'm hearing.  What, they got poison gas? 
[02:54:30]  Supposedly they were very involved making the poison gas better.  Supposedly Iraq had really bad poison gas.  Hey, it worked.  Not as effective.  I don't like the fact that Iraq is letting fucking Iran fly over their country.  So they can bring shit to Syria.  Like, like we, we, we have no say anymore in Iraq.  We fucking do all that shit.  Wait, what's happening?  They're allowing the Iranians to fly over Iraq to deliver shit to Syria.  That's what we deserve. 
[02:55:00]  I know.  There we go.  It's ridiculous.  That's exactly what we deserve.  Men and women lost their lives over that shit.  And now, now it's business as usual.  That's what we deserve.  Un-fucking-believable.  For sticking our dumb fucking red, white, and blue hat in.  And I was, again, I was four years ago and now I'm against it.  That's what we deserve by getting mixed up.  They're fucking, they hate us over there.  And they will never not hate us.  Should have left Saddam.  Absolutely.  Should have left Saddam.  Bill Maher was right.  He said not long after we should fucking, we'll have some egg on our face.  We should put him back in power. 
[02:55:30]  He was absolutely right.  Yeah.  Well, there's no putting him back now.  No, it's not good.  Not at all.  No.  Yeah, that was, he sure knew how to control those fucking idiots over there.  They were terrified of them there, too.  Yeah, yeah.  And now we got fucking, you know, now we can't even tell him, hey, stop flying, letting planes  fly over.  You think Iran would have flown their shit over Iraq when Saddam was there?  Hell no.  No.  Hell no.  But who knows what Saddam would have done with the Syrian revolution.  He'd have probably claimed it as his. 
[02:56:00]  He might have stopped the whole thing.  Knock your shit off, Syria.  Now we got to deal with stupid Syria.  Cares.  United States should just not be involved.  All the money and fucking waste of time.  Yeah.  God.  Fucking build Detroit.  Put more cops on the street.  Do all this shit, but whatever, whatever we got to do.  Let's just do shit here.  You know what happened in Detroit with a fucking, uh, court, uh, sheriff? 
[02:56:30]  What?  In court?  Some guy escaped.  He fucking had a shank made out of a comb.  And one, one sheriff is transporting three convicts.  And apparently they weren't wearing shackles or anything because this guy was able to stab  him in the neck.  Oh, shit.  He stabbed the fucking guard in the neck.  Look at him, fucking guy.  And, um, and then escaped.  He got his, he put the guard's clothes on, the sheriff's clothes on.  Did he kill him?  And, no, he didn't kill him.  Um, but he fucking stabbed him in the neck enough where he was able to get him on the 
[02:57:00]  ground, took his clothes and, um, and escaped.  But why the fuck is this one sheriff escorting three guys without them completely secured  where they can't do that?  Because Detroit's fucking broke.  Yeah, Detroit's broke.  And they can't fight.  They can't even.  Broke ass broke.  They can't even keep their, their, their people safe by having the, the right amount of people  and the right resources to keep these animals chained up.  Well, we should fucking put more money up overseas.  Let's give Egypt some more money. 
[02:57:30]  Let's give them money.  And, and Syria.  We got to fucking deal with that shit.  How about we fucking rebuild some of our, our destroyed cities?  Oh, God.  Actually, it's just nothing.  Nothing happens.  That seems too logical, though.  I mean, yeah, exactly.  What's the real answer there?  Why wouldn't we do that?  Because there's this fucking thing that's just always been in place and it's always going  to be in place where we have to make deals with the rest of the world.  Oh, we'll give you this money. 
[02:58:00]  Just do this or don't do that or whatever the fuck.  Because we think that we're, we, like, because Obama said the word exceptional before.  There's that weird thing with American exceptionalism.  Like, we're so amazing.  Let's not be so fucking exceptional and amazing.  Let's just be fucking another fucking little colorful place on a map.  Let's be great here.  Yeah, yeah.  And if anybody fucks with us, we fucking blow them apart.  Exactly.  And that's the end of it.  Yeah.  And we could fix, you know, the shit that needs a fixin' around here.  Instead of making, you know, opening up a dialogue about it. 
[02:58:30]  Let's have a dialogue about Detroit.  You don't like that?  I'll fucking just fix it.  Enough with opening up a dialogue.  Man.  Legs on that girl.  Jesus, it's.  I'm fucking, look at her.  Yeah, there you go.  I got a little slow, nice head of hair on her.  Yeah.  She looks like Jennifer Jason Leigh.  That'd be an interesting video to see the kids reading the names every year and how they've grown up.  You think they're the same kids?  I'm sure they're using some of the same kids, sure.  Yeah. 
[02:59:00]  Jesus.  Horrible.  It is.  I want to go down there to the memorial.  I haven't been.  Is it open officially?  Wow, look at all the hair fucking.  What happened?  Oh, Matt Lauer used to have hair.  Matt Lauer had.  Oh my God.  You forget.  2001.  I lost that shit fast, huh?  Jesus.  Yeah, right after 9-11.  That was it.  You think?  Tom Brokaw is there, too.  He was reporting live.  Jeez.  I hate looking at this. 
[02:59:30]  Yeah, the burning towers.  I just can't fucking.  God, that was fucked.  Just couldn't fucking do anything.  Just helpless.  Ugh.  We sure did want to bomb something, though, didn't we?  Oh, yeah.  Right after this.  Yeah.  Like, everyone's like, oh, this, you know, what did Iraq have to do with it?  And that we just fucking needed to blow some shit up.  How long did that take?  I don't remember anymore.  A couple of months.  Remember Bush and I struck the first blow with the strike of a pen? 
[03:00:00]  Yes.  And we were like, what the fuck?  Do something.  We did Afghanistan first.  Oh, yeah.  And then in April of 2002, we went into Iraq.  Shock and awe.  No.  Wait, wait, no, no.  Wasn't it shock and awe?  Iraq in 2000.  I thought Iraq was 2003.  No?  I think it was 2002.  April 2002.  Oh, I didn't realize it.  Okay.  2003?  I don't think.  Iraq was 03?  I don't think it was six months after 9-11.  Okay.  No, it was 03.  It was a year. 
[03:00:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  03.  Okay.  Because it didn't feel good.  All right.  You could stop putting 03 in the chat.  Thank you.  That seems like a long fucking time.  Yeah, because we were in Afghanistan first.  Afghanistan first.  Right.  Right.  Right.  Yeah.  And then I went to Iraq at the end of 2004.  Oh, you did.  Yes.  We cleaned up Afghanistan, though.  Oh, yeah.  It's perfectly fine now.  They just pulled it into the house and shot.  The Taliban is still running the place.  There's no fucking, yeah.  Nothing.  Oh, you're kidding.  There's no car bombs going off, killing a bunch of people.  Yeah.  That's just never going to end. 
[03:01:00]  It's exhausting if you try to follow it.  Oh, God.  All right.  Podcast number 18.  18.  It's the Happy Days racist thing.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  From last week.  Everyone asked for it on the podcast, so we're putting it out there.  So hopefully we'll do good numbers with that.  A very special episode.  Yes.  Yes.  And then we got Metallica tickets to give away.  We'll be doing that tomorrow, maybe.  Not mine.  Or Friday.  I'm going.  We got four tickets to give away?  Four pairs?  Yeah.  I wonder what celebs will be there. 
[03:01:30]  What celebs do you think will be there?  It's a Saturday night show.  Tom Hanks again?  What?  None?  What's the matter, Roland?  Who likes Metallica?  What?  A lot of people.  A lot of people.  They're like fucking, they're like metal royalty.  I'll be there.  You don't think?  Like, what?  Is that just because you love Bruce so much?  What?  Paul McCartney.  And Paul?  Sir Paul?  You think the celebrity list is going to be lacking a little bit there, Roland?  For Metallica?  Yeah, I mean, it's not like a, I mean, Bruce and Paul are iconic figures.  And this Metallica is just Metallica. 
[03:02:00]  But Metallica, it's not like fucking, it's not like Matt Damon and like those guys who  love Bruce and Paul.  Yeah, but some celebrities got to love Metallica.  The bitches?  What do you think will be there?  The bitches will be there.  So probably some musicians, some local guys.  You think?  Yeah.  Like the fucking drummer from like fucking, I don't listen to that noise.  It's like being on a job site.  Rackattaca, rackattaca.  Ah, what the hell?  I go home, I watch the ball game.  You'll go to Metallica.  What are they called?  Steel uranium?  I don't know.  What the hell? 
[03:02:30]  It's Metallica.  Yo, Jay.  What's up, man?  Hello?  Yes.  How you doing?  What's going on?  Well, we're doing a show.  And now we're talking to you.  We have a caller.  Yeah, I'm just, you know, I'm a little pissed at y'all.  All right.  You can tell that by your lackluster beginning.  Go ahead, Joe.  Why is that?  Man, what is going on with these breaks?  You guys are taking like 15, 16 minute breaks every friggin' hour.  It sucks.  It sucks. 
[03:03:00]  Hold on.  Let's see how many breaks.  Iraq, how many breaks have we taken this week?  Hold on.  We can give you a direct answer, Jay.  No, we can.  Hold on.  Jay, hold on.  Jay, we'll give you the answer.  That's fine.  I'm just telling you.  It's fucked up.  Get the on demand.  Well, why don't you let us give you the fucking answer?  Why are you saying no, no, no?  We'll give you how long we...  But there's workarounds.  Get the on demand.  Go ahead.  Or, I mean, the other thing is we're supposed to do two breaks an hour.  We just refuse to do that.  So we, on the average, only do four breaks a show now.  We're supposed to do eight. 
[03:03:30]  Yeah.  How many breaks did we take today?  Let me just say...  Jay, no, no.  Let E-Rock answer first.  Your allegation.  Alligator.  E-Rock?  The first break that we took was eight minutes plus two minutes of filler because you guys  were in the bathroom or something.  Okay, so ten minutes.  Ten minutes.  But the filler is material.  Right.  What time was that?  7.30?  Yeah, it was around 7.30.  So that's an hour and...  So it was almost 90 minutes of content before a ten-minute break.  We came back at 7.43.  Okay.  No radio show gives you 90 minutes in a row. 
[03:04:00]  I mean, it was more like 80 because we all know when we officially start.  So it's 80 minutes of content.  No one does that.  That's an hour and 20 minutes, and then we take a ten-minute break.  Okay, then what?  The next time we went to break, we had three live reads.  So that adds another three minutes to it for Anthony to have to do.  And that's material because I rule doing my live reads.  Material, yes.  So how long was that?  That's material, he said.  So the three minutes plus...  So that one was about 11 minutes.  11 minutes.  Okay.  And then we had, I think, like a minute of filler there, so 12. 
[03:04:30]  Okay.  Okay.  But is the filler material?  Filler material.  Okay, so that's material.  Yeah.  Johnny?  Okay, and that's how many other breaks?  And then the last break we took, we did three more reads, which are another three minutes.  That's 11 minutes.  Okay, sir.  And then we played the FU line, which was two minutes.  Okay, but that's material technically.  So 10, we've taken a total of 32 minutes in breaks out of almost four hours. 
[03:05:00]  Oh, boy.  Yeah, we should.  Do you understand the ratio of regular radio to that?  Like how...  In the end, no show's doing that.  You're spurled.  I appreciate you want more content, but...  Look, look, look, look.  Let me just say...  We only have so much content every day, too, by the way.  Yeah, we gotta piss and relax for a minute, too.  We're people, we're not robots.  Yeah, we're not...  Speak for yourself.  We pull the shit out of our asses half the time.  Let me just say one thing, Tate.  One thing?  You already said 18.  That's right.  Go.  What?  It was a hangout.  Oh.  Oh.  It's not me. 
[03:05:30]  We actually did straighten him out, though.  We did.  We showed him.  That guy kept calling.  All right, it's fair enough, but I...  But he's rolling.  He's like, it's like almost four hours, and you're complaining we've taken 32 minutes  of break.  And we have reads to do.  Yeah.  Like, what the fuck, dude?  How about the listeners that had to listen to his call?  Right.  That was three minutes of fucking wasted time right there.  We only have so much material, too.  Exactly.  Can't you tell?  We drank salad here today.  Uh-oh.  We were desperate.  God.  Remember that break? 
[03:06:00]  No.  No.  All right, so we got Metallica tickets to give away.  We're going to do that tomorrow and Friday, and we're going to really give them away to  listeners.  Yeah.  We figure what the hell this time instead of, uh...  That's cool.  They're not going to be sitting near us, will they?  I can't stand listeners.  I sure hope not.  Uh...  Um...  And I guess that's it.  You don't think the Rolling Stones will be there again?  Like they were for Paul?  No.  Sir Paul?  Although...  Oh, man.  Roland, uh... 
[03:06:30]  Not...  Not a big Metallica fan of Roland?  No, sir.  Well...  Why?  Oh, wow.  That's why he blew the announcement.  Yeah, that's why I didn't mind.  That is true.  Yeah, yeah.  All I know is one song, the Sandman song.  Sandman song?  The Sandman song?  Mr. Sandman.  Roar, roar.  Sandman.  Bring me a dream.  Boom, boom, boom, boom.  Make him the cutest that I've ever seen.  Wow, wow, wow.  How about there'll be celebrities there?  Mr. Sandman, give me a dream. 
[03:07:00]  Yeah, there's going to be celebs.  Yeah.  Never in many bands break into Metallica.  You think Tom Hanks will be there?  I saw him there for, uh, what, Bruce?  Yeah.  Fuck Tom Hanks, and I'll tell you why.  Whoa!  Hey, hey, hey!  It's an American icon.  Well...  That's the Cary Grant of the new millennium.  I was thinking I got to go do that jury shit again because last time I couldn't be there for two days, so I got a postponement because we were going to Montreal. 
[03:07:30]  So they rescheduled me, right?  Yeah.  So I'm thinking, okay, but I'll get out of this.  Sure.  Right?  I learned today on the way in that Tom Hanks had to serve.  He was on a case.  So what chance do I have?  Tom Hanks.  Some domestic dispute or something.  Wow.  Why is that Tom Hanks' fault?  I was thinking, you know, I'm thinking.  Probably from family ties.  If Tom Hanks doesn't have to serve, then maybe I got a shot.  Tom Hanks probably wanted to serve.  Really?  He is a very patriotic guy. 
[03:08:00]  And he wanted to probably have an interesting story or to be a part of it.  He likes being.  He wanted to.  I don't know.  I don't have a chance in hell then of getting out of this.  Not if Tom Hanks didn't get out of it.  That's what I'm saying.  But he probably didn't try to get out of it, you know?  You don't think?  No.  You don't think he stood up and said, excuse me, I'm Tom Hanks?  I'm Tom Hanks, for the love of God.  No, he's a man of the people.  But if you're Tom Hanks, wouldn't you just tell everyone all the time?  You think you would.  You wouldn't have to.  Yeah.  You wouldn't have to wait in line for a damn cronaut.  He would be like, excuse me, I'm Tom Hanks. 
[03:08:30]  He doesn't have to.  He's on the front of the line.  He doesn't have to tell people he's Tom Hanks.  People just look at him and go, oh, look, it's Tom Hanks.  Yeah.  A bosom buddy's fame.  Well, perhaps he went on to do a couple other things.  I don't remember.  Joe vs. the Volcano.  Turner and Hooch.  Turner and Hooch, right, right.  Big.  Big.  Turner and Hooch.  Was that the slobby dog?  Oh, yeah.  Before Beethoven.  Fucking Money Pit.  The Burbs.  The Burbs.  The Burbs was a hit.  Oh, yeah, it was.  That was a strong movie.  Sleepless in Seattle. 
[03:09:00]  Fuck, yeah.  Was it that one or was it the other one?  Or Waiting for Mail.  He did Sleepless in Seattle and You've Got Mail.  It's the same film.  Same fucking movie.  No, it ain't.  It's good.  They're both good.  Ugh, why?  You like that, right?  Old rom-com.  Yeah.  Ugh, you're such a fag.  Hello.  You're so excited.  You met Meg Ryan, right?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah?  So excited to meet Meg Ryan.  Were you?  Yeah, she was so nice.  Where'd you meet her?  Here.  When?  When?  Uh, she was with John Mellencamp. 
[03:09:30]  Cougar?  Yeah.  She's hanging with John Mellencamp?  Yeah.  Did you get a picture with her?  Yeah.  How'd she look?  She liked my home solo t-shirt.  They're an item?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wow.  Wasn't you at Banderas at one point?  I don't know.  Ooh, Hollywood gossip.  Yeah!  Oh, you know where this conversation should go.  Where?  Well, it's kind of a Hollywood gossip conversation.  Oh, you want to throw it around with the girls?  Yeah, we should throw it around with the girls down the hall.  Are you talking about the morning mashup? 
[03:10:00]  Yeah.  You know, I don't want to drop that one.  Girls.  It's all dudes over there, though, except for one girl.  Yeah, toss it around with the girls.  The girls like the Hollywood gossip.  Sure.  Can you book us on that show so we can throw it around with the gals?  Ooh.  Dun-da-dun-dun-dun-dun.  Dun-da-dun.  It's causing trouble.  Oh, I love it.  I gotta go to school.  You do, don't you?  I'm gonna go to school.  You guys can continue, obviously.  I gotta go to school, though.  Fuck that noise.  I gotta do a walk-through, and then I gotta do dinner tonight for the school. 
[03:10:30]  I gotta pull the lane here.  Ooh, some nice side dishes and sauces.  Our fucking, you know what?  Hey.  That caller there is gonna fucking be pissed off if I read this.  Yeah, he is.  Maybe I shouldn't read it.  Can I add one more thought to that?  Add away.  We did almost an extra hour of radio.  Yeah, we did.  Yesterday.  45 minutes?  Yesterday.  Yesterday.  Yeah, that fucker.  We're not contracted for that shit.  Fuck him.  We did.  We were on to, like, fucking 10-4-5 yesterday. 
[03:11:00]  10-4-5, and we would have went even longer, but that's when the show officially ran out.  E-Rock played the fucking Mario music.  There's only a certain amount of time.  Oh.  Oh, good.

I want to tell people about the hopper from Dish.  Um, get away from me. 
[03:12:30]  Yeah.  You know how annoying it is to, um, fast-forward through commercials during your favorite shows?  Ah, you either don't skip far enough, you end up skipping too far.  Well, thanks to Dish, they got that whole home HD DVR, the hopper.  Skipping commercials is easy.  The hopper from Dish has a great feature called AutoHop.  AutoHop gives you the power to instantly skip commercials without having to fast-forward through each commercial break.  You can select AutoHop when you play back most network primetime shows.  Put down that remote and then watch your show commercial-free. 
[03:13:00]  Only the hopper gives you the power to watch commercial-free TV.  Call them.  1-800-WATCH-TV.  Do it today.  Get yourself the hopper from Dish.  Ha-ha-la-vita.  The Opie and Anthony show is pretty much over.  This show will be available later today with SiriusXM On Demand.  After ONA Live is next.  This is After Opie and Anthony Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts. 
[03:13:30]  Here we are.  We're doing an after show today because Jim is interviewing Gene Simmons from Kiss for his Boneyard show.  I don't know when that's going to air.  But Jim's Advice Show, I would assume, is returning tomorrow.  Today we'll do After Opie and Anthony Live.  So call up 866-WOW1-WOW, 866-969-1969, and talk about whatever it is you want to talk about, what did you learn, all that great, great stuff. 
[03:14:00]  Um, it's so weird.  Obviously today's September 11th, and we come on at the time when a lot of shit was happening on that morning in 2001.  And they were doing this last year, too.  I don't think, MSNBC, starting I think around 9 o'clock, they air the simulcast of what was going on that morning. 
[03:14:30]  And it's all, it's the shots and everything, and it's good to remember, but I don't need, even the extended montages were a bit much.  I still, 12 years in, I don't know if I want to see, I don't want to be watching the exact things that happened.  You know what I mean?  I don't want to see, because it's been, it's like two hours of this.  And it's just such a horrible, it just puts everybody in a bad mood.  Dude, I want everybody to, hopefully, hopefully it motivates people to kind of think about whoever it was that lost their lives in the attack. 
[03:15:00]  If that happens, then I guess it's for the best.  But I like the idea of airing the people reading the names.  I think our local, our local channel is airing people reading the names of the people who died at the World Trade Centers now.  I feel like that's what all the cable channels should be doing.  If they're airing, if they're airing straight 9-11 stuff right now, they should be airing that instead of going back to, you know, now they're showing the Pentagon on fire and everything. 
[03:15:30]  I don't know.  Just such a shitty thing to see.  It's such a shitty day.  I kind of like the idea of at least, at least when you see the families of the people who didn't survive, at least you can see, for the most part, these are people that have continued their lives and there's something positive. 
[03:16:00]  And life is going on somewhat and the people are doing better now and that we're stronger.  You know, that's a little more motivational than just seeing, going back to that sort of horrible, helpless, what's going on feeling.  Because if you remember that day, nobody knew what was going to happen and nobody knew what was going to happen next.  For days after that, people were waiting for another attack.  People just didn't know anything.  You know, you saw the president.  He was reading a book to kids.  Nobody knew what was going on. 
[03:16:30]  Unless you are asked the conspiracy theorist, then everybody did.  But I don't think anybody knew what was going on.  So I don't, I just don't like, I don't like that MSNBC takes us directly back to where we were that day as opposed to where we are today.  With the families talking and everything.  E-Rock, do you have an opinion on this stuff?  Do you know what I'm saying about, like, I don't, I think it should be respected as it is.  But I feel like it's better to show the families talking because it shows that, you know, people have some strength. 
[03:17:00]  What's going on?  Where's tissues?  Oh, I don't know.  See, even Jim's upset.  He needs some tissues.  What do you think, E-Rock?  It's been hard to look into the studio because the TVs are right in front of me there.  Oh, and now they're showing the tower coming down.  And it's multiple angles over and over again.  And I don't know if that's how it aired back in 2001 or if this is just something they're doing now.  I think it's how it aired.  It's so, at this point, like, I get it up to the 10-year anniversary, and even that was a little much. 
[03:17:30]  But now it's just, you don't need to do a live recap of it.  What's that?  You know why it's good to show this stuff?  For all the people who snivel about TSA security and why they have to look at my shoes and all that nonsense.  This is what is.  I mean it's the same thing Obama was saying last night in this speech, that he was saying if you don't support attacks on Syria, go and watch the footage of the dead kids.  And he's saying, like, sometimes people have to see it to connect with the fact that it was a real event. 
[03:18:00]  I was just thinking that, to me, I would prefer all the channels running the people reading the names because at least then you could see that we're stronger as human beings.  There's not that sort of awful helplessness.  Yeah, and everybody has seen this by now.  But, you know, for whatever reason, it's – I'm fine with them doing it.  It's only a few minutes a year.  Yeah.  And you know what?  You forget, too.  It was 12 years ago.  There's generations of kids that this is just something in a history book. 
[03:18:30]  Yeah.  So maybe it is – I mean we don't have footage like this.  And it makes us angry when we see it.  Good.  Because it doesn't make you angry when you read about it as much as it does when you see it.  And then you're like, oh, motherfucker.  Like I like the fact that it gets people annoyed again.  And uncomfortable and upset and helpless and like –  It should.  But who do we direct that anger towards now?  You know what I mean?  I feel like when you start thinking about that, when you get angry about it again, you realize that we tried to kind of go to war over it and it didn't even work. 
[03:19:00]  We can direct the anger at our own lack of ability to act on intelligence we had or our own lack of ability to do things that were impolite.  Like a lot of these guys were on terrorist watch lists and we did nothing because we were in that fucking phony polite nonsense.  So we might want to do that or be careful who we give student visas to.  You know, all those – it doesn't have to be another country that we're attacking.  It could just be, oh, yeah, don't be a bunch of fucking hopeful dummies.  Airport security or whatever is still necessary.  Like just use it as a reminder that we're not invincible. 
[03:19:30]  Yeah.  And we're not – they caught us with our fucking pants on our ankles.  The mighty United States and we got fucked by 19 guys.  And that's why – that's what's hard for conspiracy theorists to swallow.  19 guys stuck a dick in the ass of this country and it's fucking hard to swallow.  But that's what happened.  That is at the root of the conspiracy theories is not wanting to admit that we were vulnerable.  Yeah, like we just got attacked.  I got to go.  I'll see you tomorrow.  All right.  He wants to talk to Jim.  Oh, Kenny. 
[03:20:00]  Yeah, don't let Norton go.  Norton!  Come back here for a second.  One second.  He's coming back.  He's coming back.  Oh, thank you.  Club Soto wants to talk to you for a second.  He's on the hotline.  I'll get him.  Okay, he's on the –  Yes, Kenny.  Hey, Jim, check your text messages, please, and give me an answer.  Okay, bye.  Bye.  All right.  He wants to know if he can come to my mouth.  Okay.  Yes is the answer.  I guess it – I just don't feel like – it's important to remember how angry you were and how bad it was. 
[03:20:30]  I just don't know if it's – if there's a lot of good to it when there's no place to direct the anger to.  I mean that's how I was feeling when Obama was talking about Syria last night.  I was going, okay, I understand that they're bad people or this – you know, that Assad is a bad dude and that you can't gas children.  When you murder children, it's a bad thing.  And so when he was appealing to people on a moral level, like, hey, what this guy did was wrong and somebody needs to hold him accountable. 
[03:21:00]  It's like, okay, yes, he's a horrible dictator who killed children in this country.  The problem I had was the reason for bombing Syria would be that they broke the rules and used chemical weapons, right?  So by that logic, Obama is saying that if we go back and watch video of kids dying and there's bullet holes in them instead of them dying from chemical gas, everything is fine? 
[03:21:30]  Like you can't just go around into foreign countries and attacking leaders who kill kids as a country.  You could if you want to be a superhero to everybody, but that's what – so sometimes it's not that great to just act on the anger that you have.  When you go onto YouTube or you look – an image search or whatever and you find these horrible images of what's going on in Syria, you immediately want to act. 
[03:22:00]  When you see dead bodies laying out like that, these helpless people, you go, somebody's got to hold that guy accountable.  We have the firepower to do it.  We should do it.  But then you're like, hold on.  What's going to happen?  Because that's the way we all felt after 9-11.  We were all pissed off.  I was in the same boat that Jim said he was in earlier today when we said, okay, we have to go to war with somebody.  Yes, let's go bomb Iraq.  Let's bomb everybody.  That's the way I was thinking.  That's the way a lot of people were thinking.  But then we're here 13 years later. 
[03:22:30]  We still got troops over there.  Nobody knows what we're doing.  Money is being flushed down the toilet.  The troops are coming back here and not being respected or getting the benefits that they deserve or the respect that they deserve.  And our country at home is not in great shape.  It's not in good shape enough to be spending this kind of money abroad on stuff that we don't even know what it's for anymore.  We're just there because we took out a leader and now we got nothing to do. 
[03:23:00]  Herb in Ohio.  Yeah, with the president's speech last night, it's almost a slap in the face to Americans, especially 9-11, because if we bombed Syria, we're basically supporting Al-Qaeda because the rebels in Syria are basically Al-Qaeda enemies of the United States who basically did what they did 12 years ago.  And, I mean, like you said, we're flushing money down the toilet and we don't have nothing to show for it. 
[03:23:30]  Where's our return on investment?  At this point, I just can't imagine invading a country that wasn't an imminent threat to us in the United States or at least like one degree of separation away from being a threat to us directly.  You know what I mean?  You could tell people, look, do not use the chemical weapons again.  If you start to use them and it looks as though we as a country are in any danger of this, we will blow your country into nonexistence. 
[03:24:00]  However, until that happens, let's fix Detroit.  Let's figure out what's going on with the schools in New York.  Let's figure out what's going on with everything.  Let's get people to work.  You know, we were talking yesterday or a few days ago, I think Monday, about how there's no jobs for people.  Fast food workers are going on strike because they want to make $15 an hour because there's no – you're not supposed to make a living to support a family working at a fast food place. 
[03:24:30]  But there's no blue-collar jobs left, so you have to.  Why don't we spend some time creating blue-collar jobs?  Well, the whole thing is it starts with our education system.  You know, we're getting rid of all the vo-ed programs where you can actually, you know, build skills.  Also, minimum wage jobs are basically for teenagers and people just entering into the workforce.  Minimum wage jobs are not for 30, 40, 50-year-olds. 
[03:25:00]  I mean, can you imagine if you're a teenager, like if they raise the minimum wage to $15 and I'm a teenager and I'm going to work at McDonald's and I'm getting $15 an hour?  That would be crazy to me.  I would love that because as a teenager, what are you going to do with $15 an hour?  You're not paying rent.  But you're exactly right, Herb, that these jobs are not meant for people raising families.  They're meant for people just entering the workforce. 
[03:25:30]  That's why you're supposed to have this other level where you go, you start at minimum wage when you're young.  And then once you are really in the workforce, there should be level and then level up and then level up of these other jobs that allow you to raise a family.  Exactly.  And then the government puts the burden on these, you know, companies.  I own a company and it's unbelievable how much I pay out in taxes.  You know, I get almost 50% of my profits are paid in taxes and that's not on top of my payroll taxes, workman's comp, unemployment, plus my insurance for the business, any overheads and all that too. 
[03:26:00]  And it's like, the more money you make, your insurance goes up and also your taxes go up.  And, you know, it's like it's set up to where it's trying to keep everybody in place where they're at.  Yeah, it's very – and that can't work.  I mean that's not – we're not communists.  We're not in a surf system.  We don't – we're not built into classes.  The whole point of being in America is to be able to work your way up this ladder and like, okay, I will take this job that makes this much money now because it comes with the promise of moving forward to this, to achieving this American dream. 
[03:26:30]  But, you know, if it stops and ends at McDonald's, then, yeah, of course you're going to go on strike.  Yeah.  I mean I started my business under Obama and I still have yet put myself on payroll just because of, you know, the overhead, the taxes and all that.  I mean I have not collected a paycheck in four years.  Yeah.  Five years. 
[03:27:00]  But, you know, getting back to Syria, like you said, or as I want to point out, we're going to go bomb another country that bombed itself.  Yeah.  I'd rather see them kill themselves over there, kill each other off over there than them coming here and trying to kill us.  Yeah, I mean there's no – if they were starting to develop something that could affect us or harm us or if there were even plans of any sort to say, okay, this is what we're going to do to better position ourselves in the global economy. 
[03:27:30]  We're going to start fucking with America or we're going to start fucking with these people who help America or whatever it is.  Then that's one thing.  But that's not what's happening.  Why aren't we going into Uganda and all the places that, like, Vice films documentaries where they eat people and why aren't we killing all them?  Yeah, I know.  All right.  Okay, I'm going to let you go.  Thanks, Herb.  Keep talking with you.  Okay, you're welcome.  Mongo.  Hey, Sam.  You know, the minimum wage jobs are not just for people entering the workforce. 
[03:28:00]  There's a lot of people on there that are single parents, people that can't – that got laid off from other jobs that are trying to make ends meet.  So these people that are working for minimum wage are trying to – they're not just people going to any McDonald's.  But that's what the – and that's what the problem is.  I think that – I think minimum wage jobs are designed for people just entering the workforce.  But like you said, people are getting laid off. 
[03:28:30]  There's no manufacturing anymore, so nobody's working in factories in America almost whatsoever.  You know, that's an overstatement.  But there's so few manufacturing jobs that those don't exist.  So what ends up happening is if you don't have the qualifications to go work in an office somewhere, you're either a trucker like Mongo or you've got to take a minimum wage job, and that's insane.  Right, and a lot of the problem, too, is if you think about the people that are on government subsidies, food stamps, welfare, it's not what people classify as the lazy that are just living off the system. 
[03:29:00]  A lot of the – I would say the majority of the people on the system are working poor, people that are holding down two and three jobs,  that don't have medical benefits, that don't have enough money to live off of one job.  They have to have two and three jobs.  So if you raise the minimum wage to a living wage, $11, $12, $15 an hour, you're going to get these people off of government subsidies 
[03:29:30]  because now they can make a living on their own instead of working for $7.40 an hour.  They can work for $15.  They can get off the government subsidies, and it's going to lower their dependency on welfare.  Yeah, thanks, Mongo.  I mean, but to me, like, the lack of middle-class jobs and the problems in education are, like, such humongous problems.  The economy and education are such ridiculous problems in America right now that when Syria becomes this big of an issue 
[03:30:00]  that it looks like we could feasibly attack this country, I'm going, like, what?  We didn't learn anything from what's been going on?  Like, there's no way that this is going to turn out to be a good idea.  No way.  Joe in Illinois.  Hang on.  There you go.  Joe.  Hey, man, the logic of this shit is ridiculous. 
[03:30:30]  When you see the guys, the government, the media, whatever, start posting pictures that you never see on the news,  horrible dead children, you know, they're psyching America up.  Yeah.  They get behind something, and that freaks me out.  I mean, that's total propaganda.  And it is.  And that's exactly what I was thinking, Joe.  When Obama was like, you know, go look up pictures and you tell me that that's not bad.  Like, yes, everybody's acknowledging that this is bad, but Obama, the problem is not that he killed kids. 
[03:31:00]  The problem, theoretically, is that he used illegal weapons to kill kids.  If I saw a photo and it was a bunch of kids that had been stabbed to death, I would be equally horrified.  But I couldn't then go to the president and say, hey, why aren't we bombing this guy?  He stabbed all these kids because the president would say, well, you know, he's allowed to use knives.  What am I going to do?  Well, and also, there's children dying all over the world every day. 
[03:31:30]  There's a rape epidemic in Africa.  There's – I mean, if that's our logic for going to war, then, man, we've got a long list.  Yeah, yeah.  That's what I'm saying.  Thank you, Joe.  And we're not – I mean, you know, not to overstate things.  We're not going to war.  But it's just – where does this lead to?  You know, where on – what positive would come from this?  What is this guy – is this guy Assad who has the mental capacity now to poison gas children? 
[03:32:00]  Is he going to sit there, accept attacks from the United States and be like, oh, I guess the U.S. wasn't messing around.  Maybe I'll just change my ways.  Maybe I'll start to behave myself a little bit.  No, he's going to act like a petulant child because that's how evil dictators act.  Have you never seen a movie?  The James Bond villain, when he knows he's beat, he doesn't surrender and wave the white flag.  You've got to kill the dude. 
[03:32:30]  He's not going to sit there and say, oh, I didn't realize America was so mad.  Well, now that my parents have punished me, I'll stop acting like that.  Who's on the hotline?  Nobody?  Okay.  Matt in Allentown.  Hey, Sam.  What's up, buddy?  I completely agree with the fact that you're saying McDonald's is a starter job.  And yet somebody – some teenage kid needs to make some money to get a car, whatever.  Right.  That's what it's for. 
[03:33:00]  Or even to try to – while you're in college, you're trying to pay off your student loans,  you get a job at McDonald's.  And then once you're out of college – the idea is that you get the job at McDonald's while you're in college to pay for your degree.  Once you have the degree, you're supposed to be able to get out of school and find a job.  But you can't anymore.  Nobody you're on, at least around here, everybody wants a soft, cushy job.  Nobody actually wants to work for a living anymore.  And it's crazy.  I guess maybe that's the difference in the system, that there's not that sort of – as the working class disappears, 
[03:33:30]  it's either young people who are just like, well, I have nothing.  I'm poor, and that's just the way my life is, and they accept it.  Right.  Or it's young people who were raised with money that are sitting around going, well, I don't understand why everything's not being handed to me.  What do you mean work hard?  I'm not going to do that.  Or they think they're working hard, and they're doing nothing because they've never had to.  Right.  I mean, I'm 30 years old. 
[03:34:00]  I got a house.  Me too.  I got some toys, and I go to work every day.  There's people who I see that I graduated with that still live with mom and dad, don't barely have a car.  They don't have this.  They don't have that.  I see it too, dude.  I guess we're in the exact same generation where it was like – I guess before it was this idea of – for the most part, there's always been slackers.  But for the most part, you're thinking to yourself, well, this is the way the system works. 
[03:34:30]  I'm going to get an education or not, but the key is to get a good job that's upwardly mobile, start a family and doing this and doing that.  And now you see people who are my age and Matt's age who are 30 years old, and some of them moved out, and now they're back with their parents because they couldn't make it work.  Like a lot of people are now – the idea of moving out of the house once you're out of college or once you're in the workforce is extremely rare. 
[03:35:00]  I don't know what the solution is either.  It's weird.  I'd love to – you know.  But I know attacking other countries is no part of it.  No, I completely think we should stay out of it.  Yeah.  I mean, I know it looks shitty when the guy kills his own people, but who are we to say?  You know?  Right, at the end of the day, like – see, if I'm thinking – and that's why the fact that NBC is playing the September 11th stuff really kind of keys in with you because even a year and a half after September 11th, we were all still so mad that we were like, yes, whatever country you say we should go to war with, we will go to war with them. 
[03:35:30]  But now we've actually seen what happens when you take a leader of a country out of power.  You can't –  But that was a complete clusterfuck too.  Right.  That's what I'm saying.  You can't just – you can't just go kill a dictator and say, well, you were bad, so now you're dead because guess what?  Now you're stuck being in charge of a country and a populace who may not be a big fan of yours. 
[03:36:00]  The problem in America is everybody wants – yeah, OK, punish the bad guy, but they want to be politically correct about it.  Right.  If you started at one end of Iraq, started killing everybody supposedly attached to Al-Qaeda, all of a sudden the people in the next town are going to go, hey, it's that guy in that house over there.  Right, right, right, right.  We don't know enough.  Right.  Thanks, Matt.  Thanks.  Hey, buddy.  Let's go to David in North Carolina.  What's up, prime time? 
[03:36:30]  How are you doing, buddy?  Doing good.  Hey, Mongo or Mondo, whatever the hell his name was, I don't know what the fuck he was talking about.  His name's Mongo.  He's a good – he's a trucker.  He's a trucker.  He has nothing to do with people on subsidies or anything, OK?  I own 300-plus rental properties here in my town.  Yeah.  90% of it is what you consider a lower income.  OK.  75% of that are people on the government subsidies, a disability or welfare, food stamps, what have you.  And that 75%, they are the ones that are completely healthy, completely fine. 
[03:37:00]  I see that because they live in our apartment.  It is – it's an interesting thing with – like, unemployment, I see – it's weird because when you're growing up, like, you hear about unemployment benefits as a kid.  And unless you're growing up with parents that don't have money, you're thinking, well, that's – like, it's not even – to me, like, that's something that I – I don't know anybody whose parents are on unemployment that I'm aware of. 
[03:37:30]  And to me, that's like, well, that's something that I'll never encounter in my life.  And then I graduate college.  Well, I'm not even talking about unemployment.  And, dude, every –  You have to have a job at one point.  I'm talking about straight-up owned adult.  And generations upon generations, their kids, their parents, their grandparents, they were all on some type of government assistance, and they're passing down generation to generation.  That's all they know.  They're uneducated as hell.  And they – look, one of my complexes, they almost just sort of hold a clinic on how to get money from the government amongst each other. 
[03:38:00]  It's sickening.  Well, I mean, but that's what happens when you grow up around the people.  It's like when you're in prison and you learn how to be a better criminal, like when you're around people.  Yes, that's exactly –  It's just kind of what you do unless you –  It's unacceptable and that me and you owe it to them.  Me and you owe them.  Yeah.  That's what it is, and that's why they can feel – they can sleep at night knowing that they are living off of our hard-earned money. 
[03:38:30]  But I think you also – you see that – I see what you're saying, but I think you see that – that's a personality type more than it is just the people in this.  The income bracket feel this way because as you go up the chain, you can see rich kids do the same thing.  Rich kids feel like, oh, I should have somebody working for me.  I should – because I don't know if it's a matter of how people are raised or the fact that they're not educated.  They're not educated and uneducated.  If that's the STEM and the family unit is – there is – you heard it. 
[03:39:00]  Every politician spit that shit out, but they're not wrong about this.  They're actually right.  The family unit and education, they're too stupid to get a job.  They got their pants hanging off their ass, threads down their back, tattoos on their face.  Fuck no, I'm not going to hire you.  Right.  I mean, look, do you think I want you to be the face of my business?  Not if there's a tattoo on it, no.  But – and I'm not here to say that everybody that's on government assistance is that way. 
[03:39:30]  I am not.  I'm not that big of an asshole or big of a guy.  No, I mean obviously government assistance is something that people – there are people who need it.  But they're – when you develop a system like that, there's going to be people who take advantage of it.  But I think that it's less people – every income bracket, every class bracket, every time you group people together, in any way you group them together, you're going to find – nowadays I think a pretty large percentage that are going to be there to do the minimum amount of work possible and get the maximum amount of reward that they can possibly get. 
[03:40:00]  And maybe that's just the human condition.  I don't know.  All right.  Thanks, David.  Later.  Let me go to Brian in Orange County.  What's up, Brian?  Hey, what's up, man?  Good.  Yeah, you know, I think the push for a $15 an hour minimum wage for unskilled labor is pretty laughable.  You know, we already see now these jobs being replaced by computerized kiosks. 
[03:40:30]  By robots.  We were talking about that earlier this week.  Yeah, so, you know, you've got a job that a machine can do, and you're demanding more money.  Why?  You know, and that's supposed to solve our problems.  If $15 an hour is going to improve the economy, why not $100 an hour?  If there's no negative ramifications to increase, just arbitrarily increasing people's pay because you want to seem like a nice guy, then why not $1,000 an hour? 
[03:41:00]  I really think that the bigger problem, because you have to sit there and you go, okay, you know, these are people who are trying to get by.  Well, why are they stuck in these minimum wage jobs?  And then I think that the problem is that there are so few middle class jobs that the wrong people are taking these minimum wage jobs.  Like the people – there's got to – minimum wage is designed for that kid, not for somebody – not for like a single parent or something. 
[03:41:30]  But too many of the – too much of the time, single parents and sometimes not single parents are the ones that end up, you know, at McDonald's or Starbucks or whatever.  Absolutely.  These are supposed to be entry-level jobs, you know, for fund money.  But, yeah, the middle class has been eroded in this country by our government, by, you know, the devaluation of our currency.  And this is the crazy thing.  That we've eroded the middle class, okay?  So the middle class is disappearing on a daily basis, and what are we doing to the lower class? 
[03:42:00]  We want to replace their jobs with robots.  So they're not going to survive either.  So what – like I don't understand what the vision is.  It's inevitable that they're going to be replaced because they are jobs that a monkey can do.  So, you know, rather than –  That's not getting inappropriate.  Rather than keeping jobs here or giving people skills, you know, the government has an incentive by having these low-skilled workers that are indebted to the government. 
[03:42:30]  And a lot of them are working part-time and receiving government assistance.  So that's just – you know, that's the government buying support.  These people are never going to bite the hand that feeds them.  Yeah, I don't know.  I mean, I don't know if that's true because a lot of times you're talking to the other guy.  People don't really always care where they're getting fed from because they think they should just be getting fed.  And whether it's the government or whether it's their parents or whether it's their employer or whether it's whatever. 
[03:43:00]  I'm not saying that this is something that just people who are on government assistance do.  I'm saying this is something people across the board do.  They kind of forget, you know, who's butter in their bagel if you catch my drift.  Yeah, you know, the government seems to be absolved from this, though.  You'll see workers protest and picket against their employers when they feel like they're not getting treated properly.  But they never blame the government for overregulation that drives manufacturing jobs out of the country or for devaluing the currency, which makes it so that a single working parent can't support their family. 
[03:43:30]  Now you have to have both parents out of the house.  But it's just – yeah, thanks, Brian.  It's just so complicated, though, because that's what we need is to bring back some manufacturing jobs into the country.  But how can we?  It's way too cheap to get things manufactured overseas.  So if we – what's the government going to do? 
[03:44:00]  Insist that a certain percentage of whatever is made in the United States?  Well, if they do that, then everything is going to cost three times more.  A ton of money, yeah.  Yeah, I mean Apple is already making like whatever, a 200 percent profit on every phone they sell.  Can you imagine if they weren't getting their labor done for pennies on the hour?  Well, part of the labor thing, too, was –  It costs $10,000 for a phone, Eric.  I don't have 10 Gs.  I know that.  But part of the labor thing, too, was one is that some corporations got greedy, went outside of the country. 
[03:44:30]  But then also didn't some of the workers kind of price themselves out?  Well, I mean –  I'm not saying by fault, but it's just like when they say –  With unions and everything, we deserve this, we deserve this, and bring us to the next level.  Companies can't afford that, so then they force the hand to go somewhere else.  Maybe, but you're talking about a system now where if you're saying I'm pricing myself out by asking for more than $3 an hour, then yeah, I'm going to price myself out.  That wasn't the case here. 
[03:45:00]  I know it wasn't then, but now – and as far as the unions and stuff go, the one thing you have to realize is as much as there are unions who are corrupt, as much as there are unions who complicate things, and maybe there are unions who make things tougher, somebody is going to have that power.  And if you don't give the power to the unions, it's going to be the dudes in corporate who have all the power.  And if you don't give that kind of power to the unions, then you're going to end up giving that amount of power to the people in charge of the company, and the people in charge of the company already have enough power. 
[03:45:30]  So it would get much, much worse, I think, without the unions.  Chris in Canada.  Hey, Sam.  My question would be is the employee that's currently making $15 an hour, is that employer going to have to jack them up to $20 after – you know what I mean? 
[03:46:00]  Yeah, I can only think that this cyclical thing becomes, okay, minimum wage is now $15.  Okay, so you're right.  So the guy making $15 now makes $25.  Okay, so the cost of a hamburger instead of $4 is now $7.  Okay, so now my $15 an hour gets me about as far as $7 an hour did.  Exactly.  You know, it's like I think that that's not – the answer is not raising minimum wage a lot.  But, you know, if you want to raise it a little bit, then great. 
[03:46:30]  You know, when I was in high school, I would have loved to have gotten, you know, an extra buck an hour.  But the thing is making more jobs for the middle class.  What was minimum wage when you were in high school?  I think $5.65 or something like that.  Jeez.  Why?  What was it for you?  $4.10.  Man, oh, man.  But that's also when gas was $0.99.  Yeah.  Literally.  Gas costs $0.99 a gallon.  I know.  I was there.  That's right, kids.  Your Uncle Eric and me lived in a time.  $10 really did well for you on the weekend. 
[03:47:00]  You kidding me?  You get a road trip for $10.  John in Texas.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Good show today.  Thanks.  I want to just go ahead and throw into the mix.  One thing I've noticed, I'm 27.  I've been to college.  I dropped out, couldn't do it.  It wasn't for me.  And over the past couple years, I've seen that an issue that we have in this country is there's  no emphasis on the young kids growing up, going through high school, to learn a skill.  It's all about, hey, go to college, you'll get a job. 
[03:47:30]  Yeah.  And it's not even go to college, get a job, because you're right.  I agree with you.  I think that all the schools are kind of centered around passing standardized tests.  And so when you graduate high school, number one, like you said, John, kids don't have  any skills.  They haven't learned anything that they can do.  All their push is, well, you got to just keep going forward in the education system.  Just keep going forward.  So there's no skill.  But also, they're not taught anything about economics. 
[03:48:00]  So you get out of high school, you don't know how to balance a checkbook when you leave  high school?  Well, and life is all about, I mean, to have a goal in some place, it's upward mobile in  something, you have to be able to do.  And it used to be that going to college gave you a piece of paper that said, hey, look,  I can do this.  And I'm able to be trained to do this job or this mindset.  I can be taught.  But we have a lot of people who go to college, they don't want to get a technical job or 
[03:48:30]  a high-skill job, and they just want to get an art degree or a communications degree in  something that's just a piece of paper.  And they assume that then they can go out into the workplace and, hey, I got a degree,  so where's the job?  Like, but that's exactly, when I was in Syracuse, I just wanted, I just wanted a degree.  Okay, I was like, I just got to, I want to get out of school.  I don't want to be here anymore.  So let me just get a degree in anything.  So I ended up getting a degree in sociology.  But guess what?  The reason that I wanted a degree in anything was because I knew I was coming back here to 
[03:49:00]  the O&A show because I had already interned on the O&A show.  And I was, the whole thing was, I'm going to get a degree, any degree, I'm going to get  out of college, and then I'm going to get back to then XM Radio, and I'm going to get a  job there.  I have an opening, I can get it done, and I got it done.  But the idea, but you're right, John, that most people take the first half of that plan  and just are like, whatever, I'll just get a degree in anything.  But then they leave college and they don't have that second path. 
[03:49:30]  They don't have the plan figured out.  Well, there's no skill.  They don't have, they didn't develop a skill.  They don't have the personality or they don't like to go do radio or they don't have the  skills to do, you know, what it's sales or management or whatever.  They don't have the IT skills to do technical jobs.  I spent all my time, I spent all my time in a college radio station trying to develop  the skill of broadcasting.  I just wish somebody had told me the industry was collapsing. 
[03:50:00]  That would have been fantastic news.  Unfortunately, the industry is collapsing all over the country, man.  And I'm going to say one last thing.  I got to get into the office, but I want to say one last thing is that, you know, with  old Syria, whenever you have a country that's powered by the military industrial complex,  people who want to go to war are the people who make money from war.  And that's, that's the only thing I really look at in this situation is who's going to  benefit from going to Syria and dropping bombs and, and, and spending, spending taxpayers  money.  Yeah.  I mean, if we learned anything coming out of nine 11 and coming out of Iraq and coming 
[03:50:30]  out of Afghanistan, I have not, I don't feel like I've benefited as a human being and as  a citizen, just an average citizen from actions taken against Iraq.  I think that, you know, the TSA is important.  All right.  See you later.  I think that the TSA actually does a good job and I think we've avoided terror attacks.  And like Jim was saying, we've done a better job of being aware of, uh, potential attacks  and, and not trusting everybody and figuring that out. 
[03:51:00]  So at home, we don't have as many attacks, but I mean, the fact that we're still,  fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan and we have troops going over there and every, and it's  like, what, we're doing nothing.  And now you're talking about Syria.  What are you fucking nuts?  But he's not sending troops over there.  That's what he says right now.  He's sending bombs instead.  Like what the fuck happens after bombs?  What happens?  He's like, no, they're going to be a targeted attacks. 
[03:51:30]  And I'm like, okay, well, what if these targeted attacks accidentally hits a Assad?  Oops, Assad's dead.  Now, what are we going to do?  Just let the country run itself.  This is probably a dumb guy question, but I'll ask it anyway.  Please do.  I understand he has the power, but he's going through the process, what have you, but is  announcing this publicly that we're going to do this and it's going to be military attacks  and strategic attacks.  And it's like, you're just telling everybody, shouldn't this be stuff they're planning?  And then all of a sudden announce, Hey, we just did this. 
[03:52:00]  Jess and me were talking about that last night.  Like, what are you doing?  Why do we need to know everything ahead of time?  I think it's because he's going to try to get Russia to take the brunt on this one.  He's going to try to, well, why don't you strike him?  I don't know if we're going to do it.  Why don't you help us out with this?  And just say, well, you know, because last night he's saying, this is what I'd like to  do, but there was no when, where, why.  He's like, yeah, I think it's a good idea.  Maybe I get with Putin and see if he can help us out because he could just do it and tell  us about it later.  You're right. 
[03:52:30]  But I think that especially after hearing the response of the American people, he's kind  of starting to realize like, oh, this may not be the greatest idea in the world.  On the front page of Drudge right now, headline is Russia to renew, offer supply of these missile  defense systems to Iran.  Putin just renewed a deal to supply Iran with missile defense systems and other things.  Oh, good.  Yeah.  Helpful.  So he's helping us out.  Thanks, Putin.  Why don't you keep feeding that horse with your shirt off? 
[03:53:00]  Ray in North Carolina.  You there, Ray?  Ray going once, going twice.  Jeff in Mississippi.  Hey, Sam.  Hi, buddy.  Hold on here for the speaker.  From those lawsuits, I mean, that's, you know, you take an employee at McDonald's, you pay  them $15 an hour.  First time they pour hot coffee on their self, they say, hey, you know, the lady that poured  hot coffee on herself and she sued and got millions, I'm going to sue because they should 
[03:53:30]  have had a higher drip lip on it.  Or when I'm frying french fries, they need to supply me with the asbestos suit that I  can wear so the grease won't pop on my skin.  It's amazing.  I saw this documentary on Netflix and it was pro frivolous lawsuits.  I forget what the documentary was called, but it was about it started with that old woman  who spilled hot coffee on her lap.  And it was and but the gist of the documentary was these lawsuits are being made to look frivolous 
[03:54:00]  because they don't want people to get what they deserve.  And they start going through this whole thing and they show the burns that were on this lady's  lap and they were severe like this lady got the shit burned out of her.  And then they're like, everybody said it happened while the lady was driving.  But the truth is that the lady was parked in a car and she was in the passenger seat.  She wasn't even driving.  And they're going through all this stuff.  And then at the end of the day when they're like, so, yeah, so, you know, because of these  severe burns and because she wasn't driving and because I'm sitting there going, isn't 
[03:54:30]  there a slight buyer beware here?  Like at the end of the day, no matter how old you are, no matter what pants or no pants  you're wearing, whether you're moving or not, don't you know, coffee's hot?  That's like, you know, a shop teacher that sues a saw manufacturer because he cut his  darn fingers off.  Right.  Like saws are sharp.  Coffee's hot.  And there's a certain danger that's understood.  I mean, I can't even I'm going to thank you for calling in, Jeff. 
[03:55:00]  But Frivolous Lawsuits is a whole other show on my new I'm changing after Open Anthony  Live into a politically driven show.  Obviously, that documentary was called Hot Coffee.  That's what it was called.  Right.  Did you watch it?  I it's on my favorites list.  I haven't gotten to it yet.  You got to watch.  I read the description.  I said, oh, I need to watch this because I'm an idiot and I don't do any reading.  And usually if there's a well-made documentary, you could shift my point of view any way the  wind blows.  Like I'll watch the documentary and be like, yeah, that's right.  I watched King Corn and I was like, that's on my list, too. 
[03:55:30]  I go, Jess, we're never eating corn again.  And she was like, are you sure?  Just take a bite of this.  I go, OK, I'll take what that's delicious.  All right.  Put corn back on the plate.  We'll keep eating corn.  But it can be used to fuel cars.  But yeah, but this documentary Hot Coffee was the one one of the few documentaries where  I've sat there watching it going, I don't agree with this whatsoever.  That lawsuit is still frivolous.  That lady, it's a terrible accident. 
[03:56:00]  I hope that that never happens to me.  But one way I'm going to prevent that from ever happening to me is I won't drink coffee.  I won't have very hot liquids on my lap.  I'll check the lid.  I'll put the lid on nice and snug.  Let me go to Ray.  You back, Ray?  Hey, I'm here.  How you doing, guy?  Good.  How you doing?  Hey, I'm a franchise owner of 15 McDonald's here in North Carolina.  And I'll tell you, plain and simple economics, while $15 an hour won't work. 
[03:56:30]  Why?  It's plain and simple.  The pocketbook.  And I'll tell you why.  Yeah, tell me why.  We can easily raise it to $15 an hour, but do you want to pay $15 for a Big Mac?  That's what I was thinking.  Like, it kind of defeats the purpose of McDonald's.  Now, who works at your McDonald's?  Are these mainly, are they kids?  Are they people who should be on minimum wage jobs?  Or are they adults with families to support?  Believe it or not, right now, it's a 50-50 split between the elderly, the on retirement, 
[03:57:00]  and the only one who works so many hours.  Yeah, I get that.  The retirement and the very young, like you said.  But it's not, because it is a tough life working at McDonald's.  If you've got a family to support, god damn, like that is.  Well, that's exactly right.  Here's the thing.  Yeah.  The cause of the implementation, unless, hopefully, our Republican Congress will be funded,  but the implementation of full, all-out, unadoperated Obamacare starts November 1 of this year.  Two months from now, we have to, have to drop our full-time employees to 29 hours a week 
[03:57:30]  because we can't afford to pay the insurance, even with them making minimum wage.  More importantly, more importantly, Ray, next time I'm in North Carolina,  can I stop by for some free chicken nuggets?  Sure.  Come on, baby.  Thanks, buddy.  Bye.  Let me go to last call of the day is Marshall in Texas.  A happy birthday, Mr. Sam Roberts.  Thank you, Marshall. 
[03:58:00]  Hey, man.  The last guy who called was an asshole.  He sucked.  Okay.  And, uh, it's all the rich people's fault, and it's capitalism's fault, and, uh, slabo!  Okay, that was a weak last call, even with the slabo.  Hey, man, you can't blame the poor people.  Blame the rich people.  It's always the rich people's fault.  You know what?  At the end of the day, blaming the rich people is the same thing as blaming the poor people.  You can't generalize, man.  It's the rich people's fault.  What?  You just did that. 
[03:58:30]  How about there's people in every group that it's their fault?  Because there are assholes in every color.  In every situation.  Every income group.  All right?  I'm a middle-class asshole, and Eric is an upper-class asshole.  Upper-middle-class.  Okay, upper-middle-class.  I know.  You still like to be with the people.  Look, we gotta make room for Ron and Fez.  Stay tuned for that.  Thank you for letting me get some shit off my chest today, and, uh, we'll be back tomorrow.  Goodbye, everybody.
