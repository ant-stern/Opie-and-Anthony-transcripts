<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The October 18, 2001, Opie and Anthony Show was a raucous recap of their Philadelphia roadshow the previous day, heavily punctuated by listener calls,  audio clips from the event, and the hosts' characteristically crude humor. The broadcast opened with Opie and Anthony joking about their hangovers from the trip, which involved copious amounts of alcohol at a strip club (Cheerleaders) where Jim Norton acquired body glitter from lap dances, Jeff from Foundry Music passed out, and Jeff later vomited in a taxi. Opie recounted an encounter with a woman resembling Chyna.  The hosts contrasted the New York and Philadelphia audiences, highlighting the Philly women's enthusiastic participation, including frequent "wowing" (flashing) and beer-throwing.

The roadshow itself involved a bikini contest, a "couch dance" area offering more intimate encounters, and the repeated beer-bombing of "Stalker Patty," dressed as Super Lady, during her runway walk.  Numerous callers corroborated these accounts, adding details like the lead singer of Octane getting hit with beer and further descriptions of Jeff's extreme intoxication. One caller recounted having sex in a bathroom with someone claiming to be from WYSP, only to be interrupted by bouncers.  Brother Joe, who opened the show dressed as Osama bin Laden, was pelted with beers, Sweet'n Low, and paintballs fired by Anthony.  Photos and videos from the event were repeatedly advertised as available on opieandanthony.com and foundrymusic.com, showing Brother Joe's welts and Anthony's paintball gun.

The show included a call with Ozzy Osbourne, who was en route to an in-store appearance via helicopter and exhibited slurred speech.  The hosts and Norton discussed Ozzy's new album.  Audio clips from the bus ride back featured two intoxicated women, referred to as "retarded Laverne and Shirley," repeating "yin-yang party" and engaging in nonsensical conversation.  Other audio snippets included a foul-mouthed Tom Brokaw impersonation.  Further audio from the bus captured intoxicated conversations between Lady Diane Marion and Patty, detailing their on-stage actions (including exposing breasts and buttocks),  alcohol consumption (Lady Di claiming 10-12 drinks),  and Lady Di's attraction to "Stinky," along with Patty threatening to cut a man's genitals.  The hosts lamented segments of the road show audio being censored ("dumped") by the station, specifically referencing jokes about tattoos and gum.

Comedian Stephen Lynch, who performed at the road show, called in, mentioning a distracting floor-mopper and an impromptu nude performance by "Hot Liz."  The hosts announced upcoming shows in Boston (a "Grave Rave" Halloween party) and Washington D.C., acknowledging the latter's apparent dislike of the show.  They also proposed a "boob-a-lantern" contest.  Other segments included a foul-mouthed Tom Brokaw impersonation reacting to the anthrax attacks, and promotional segments for WWF Smackdown and Restaurant Week in New York City.

The show also included a prank call segment from their "Art to Menor World" CD, a discussion about a Spinal Tap concert where the band allegedly behaved rudely and blew off the show's promotional efforts, despite Anthony's "entourage" being denied backstage access.  This was followed by a crude commentary on a fictionalized VH1 Def Leppard "Behind the Music" style movie involving dismemberment and drug use.  The conversation included references to Penn Jillette, Stephen Van Zandt, and various *Saturday Night Live* cast members, and an encounter between a man from *Will & Grace* (described as the gay character trying to appear heterosexual) and another attendee involving homophobic slurs. Jim Brewer was mentioned as a scheduled guest but didn't appear.  The broadcast concluded with an angry caller failing to respond when his name was called, leading to Opie's frustrated outburst.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Opie and Anthony.  How are my little pigs today?  Do I have to drive the bus? Can I ride on the bus? Where's the bus?  The thing with the young girl is I think we're going to have to...  Well, I'll go to court with you.  She's not 18. She's not 18. It's a mocker.  There's no tea.  Do I have to drive the bus? Can I ride on the bus? Where's the bus?  How are my little pigs today?  We use you for good radio. We're not your friends.  Unbelievable.  Oh my lord, shoot me now.  The thing with the young girl is I think we're going to have to... 
[00:00:30]  Well, I'll go to court with you.  I don't know which one to watch. Opie, Anthony.  Do I have to drive the bus? Can I ride on the bus? Where's the bus?  Lewis Black.  He's probably at home listening going, they're doing it all wrong.  Opie.  How are my little pigs today?  And Anthony.  The Opie and Anthony show will not be heard today because they are hungover. 
[00:01:00]  Enjoy, best of.  No.  We're just kidding. We're here.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Don't tune out.  Wow.  It's Thursday. It's... I don't even know the date.  To prove we're here, October 18, 2001.  Wow, man.  A couple phone numbers right off the bat for the New York audience.  877-692-1027. 
[00:01:30]  Anywhere else, including Philly, who treated us like kings yesterday.  Yeah.  866-277-4.  Wow.  We just got back from Philly.  Yeah.  Pretty beat.  Literally an hour before the show.  Pulling in.  Back to New York.  What a time.  What a time we had with our friends in Philly. 
[00:02:00]  Oh.  They're not a party.  That's for sure.  I'll give them that much.  Well, we obviously have a lot to talk about today.  Where do we begin?  The freaks.  The fun.  The drinking.  The boobs.  We can begin with this one.  I rode the train back with Norton from Philly.  And he's got body glitter all over his face.  How'd you get that?  Lap dances.  Oh, right. 
[00:02:30]  The after party.  Cheerleaders.  We're having a serious conversation on the train.  I can't even concentrate because he's got body glitter all over the side of his face.  Normally I would shower when I get up, but I overslept today and panicked a little.  Yeah, you did.  Norton called me up just panicking.  He called every...  No.  Well, we called him...  I don't know.  We called him at least six or seven times.  He calls me in my room.  And he's like, I woke up late.  Everyone's gone.  Where's the train?  Where is everyone?  Who's what?  Where? 
[00:03:00]  He just loses his mind.  You'd make a great lieutenant.  I don't know.  Shoot.  Somewhere.  What are you saving up to be, George?  See?  What do you think I'll pay?  Uh-uh.  Right?  Yeah.  So he called it a tizzy.  I said, I don't know.  The guys are catching.  What'd you get?  The 1145?  1145, yeah.  You've got to get in the 1145 train.  I said, I don't worry about it.  You can make it.  You can do it.  And then after I hung up, I'm like, I wonder if he thought I should have invited you along 
[00:03:30]  to drive back with me.  And I'm like, oh, why the hell didn't I do that?  I would have called back if there was no other way.  But I figured there was a way to get back.  You know what it was, too?  I was leaving right then and there.  Oh, why are you leaving?  Because I assumed it was going to take me a lot longer to get back.  But you drive 90 miles an hour, and you get there quicker than the train did.  All right.  Well, we've got to focus.  We've got to figure out where to begin.  We were just shot.  We spent 15 straight hours with the WYSP gang. 
[00:04:00]  That was 15 hours, huh?  Yeah, we got in.  We started at 1030 in the morning.  And, well, you guys went even longer than I.  I gave in at 130.  Ben gave in at 430.  430, Ben?  Stop it.  Well, watching TV and stuff.  But, I mean, whoa.  I was out cold by 130.  Well, we went home.  We went back to the hotel, too.  But, Stink and I just watched stupid crap.  I don't even know what we watched.  Were you still invading the minibar and drinking? 
[00:04:30]  No, not really.  A little bit.  But not bad.  A little bit.  Not bad.  Man, everyone was hammered.  Lynch was so drunk.  I felt so bad for Tyke because he was like, dude, I have to take these two drunks.  Lynch and his friend were wasted.  He had to drive them back at like 230 in the morning.  Those two were wrecked.  And then, what's his name from Foundry Music passed out in the strip joint?  Jeff.  What's his name, Jeff?  Jeff passed out.  He was wasted.  Jeff was sleeping at cheerleaders. 
[00:05:00]  Head back in the chair, just snoring away.  I don't blame them.  They weren't getting naked.  That's what they do.  Dude, the lap dances were phenomenal.  They, uh, I think you trade off that they don't actually, uh...  It's just weird being in a strip club that has a bunch of girls that aren't getting naked on the stage as they dance around the pole.  They're wearing as little as they can without, uh, showing, uh, nip and push.  That's what they do at Hooters.  No.  No. 
[00:05:30]  No.  The thing is, the trade off, the quality of girl.  Ugh.  There were some, uh, great looking girls there last night.  There were some beasts there as well.  Well, you get that.  I didn't see one ugly chick.  I'm not kidding you.  I really didn't.  Uh, Opie got the rock.  Conan the dancer?  Oh, yeah.  Well, she was a...  Wow.  I don't know what that was all about.  There was a girl that came up to me that looked like, uh, Chyna from the, you know, the WWF.  She's no longer with the WWF.  If Chyna cut all her hair off and, and, and bleached it blonde, same voice, everything. 
[00:06:00]  I'm like, there's no way you're, you're a female.  I thought at some point Opie was hanging out watching the girls with David Banner and pissed him off.  Because I looked over and, man, that's what I saw.  The Incredible Hulk was all over.  Yeah, it was the female Hulk.  She had a lot of, uh, muscles, but I'm trying to explain to her, I'm like, hey, man, you got a great body.  Yeah, obviously you got discipline, you work hard on it, but I, I need some curves. 
[00:06:30]  I look over and she's doing some muscle move right in front of Opie.  I'm like, what's going on over there?  And then she's getting pissed because I don't want to lap dance.  I know I don't want to lap dance from, from the beast.  You, you, you were trying anything you, because I was sitting right next to you.  You were trying anything you could.  You were trying to point out, you're like, Rick likes the muscle chicks.  Go over to him.  Anything.  And those two sales guys, I think they were the, uh, the, uh, the culprits.  Yeah, somebody set me up and I'm like, oh, and, and they obviously paid her because she, she would not leave me alone.  I'm like, no, I'm okay. 
[00:07:00]  I just want to hang.  And I was going to point it off on, uh, Jim, but you were gone.  I got, I'm, I'm thinking in my head, you're the only one that would appreciate something like that.  No, she was, I saw her.  She was just, I'm not into muscular girls like that.  I got one lap dance from a girl and then some guy bought me one from this little, uh, Asian girl.  And, and she's like, do you want to stay for one more song?  And had I stayed for one more song, I would have finished.  Really?  Yeah.  I was really close and I was glad the song ended.  What was, what was going on in the secret room? 
[00:07:30]  It was just lap dances.  It was lap, but, but I mean, what was, uh, able to go on in there?  They call them couch dances.  Couch dances.  Big difference.  And, and, uh.  Were knees involved.  Like they do in New York.  Touching and knees.  Crotch on crotch.  Nice.  Oh, really?  Okay.  Squeeze my ass, baby.  There you go.  She kept saying, squeeze my ass.  And you were able to grab her ass and squeeze?  With both hands.  Oh, look at that.  See?  Okay.  That's, that's worth the price of admission right there.  Phenomenal, right?  Yeah, because the clothes are off.  You're not going to be able to touch anyway.  I'd rather touch in a bikini. 
[00:08:00]  At least get some, um, Heine Globe touching.  There you go.  See?  You, you, you, sometimes you go to these clubs.  They don't let you touch.  And you got to sit there like you're strapped into the chair.  Yeah.  While she rubs.  And, and like you're moving because she's rubbing her boobs on your neck or something.  It sucks.  Dude, I was so pleased.  Were you?  Oh my God, he's so happy.  Put him.  Happiest I've ever seen him.  Did you wash your face?  No.  All right, put, put him, put him under a light.  Let's see.  Because it's hilarious.  I got to see.  The body glitter on the side of his face.  No, I can come here.  I got to get a closer look.  I want to see the body glitter.  It's really, it's, the lights aren't, no, it's the other side. 
[00:08:30]  And the lights aren't.  Oh, yeah, look at by his eye there.  It's all over the side of his face, man.  On the, on the, on the train.  On the train, because, you know, the sunlight's blasting through the window.  You know, it's only on the left side of your face.  You've been tagged, my man.  I know.  You've been tagged.  Really funny.  That made me giggle, man.  I was laughing at that.  That's great.  Yeah, the body glitter on you.  Yeah, the girls were hot.  And if you went into that little room area, you're able to grab a little hip.  You know what I mean?  Grab some ass.  Yeah, hip and thigh. 
[00:09:00]  It's nice, right?  Uh-huh.  I got into a discussion with one of them.  Her, her life, uh, life goal is to, to sleep with Rod Stewart.  Oof.  Oof.  What the hell do you want to do that for?  And she thinks she's getting closer, because every time he comes to town, she gets to dance  on stage a little bit, flirt with Rod, and she's convinced next time he comes to Philly  that this is going to be the time that he bangs her.  If anybody on earth doesn't realize this man sucks the youth out of women through his junk,  he's like some kind of an F vampire or something. 
[00:09:30]  You see some of the supermodels and beautiful girls, and they're with him for a few years,  and they're haggard, and he goes on to the next one.  Yeah, good boy.  Yeah, you're like, good boy.  So that was her goal, huh?  That's what she said.  Who was the guy that puked?  And then she was bitching that, uh, every guy he goes out with is a minute man.  I'm like, I don't care.  He barked out in the L.A.L.A.S.  Who barked?  Jeff.  I guess he was out.  Yeah, he puked all, I guess there's photos going around of him. 
[00:10:00]  That was when, he was in the cab I was in, on the way in.  Get this, it's me, my girlfriend, Jeff from Foundry, Froy,  and then in the front seat to top it all off, Big Kev.  Wow.  We were going, any time we hit, uh, I'm not even talking a bump.  I'm talking just a little waver in the road.  You'd hear the drive shaft on the hump go, bop, bop, bop, bop. 
[00:10:30]  There was more weight than that.  And then we pile out, and Jeff just bends over and pukes on his shoes.  At least he didn't do it, uh, at least he didn't do it in the car.  It was a hell of a party.  I like Jeff.  He was miserable.  We're sitting there talking, and he's like, uh, you know, I'm just ugly.  And, you know, girls can sense when you have no money,  because the strippers weren't coming over to them.  Dude's a classic.  I like him.  They hooked us up at cheerleaders, man.  Yeah.  The guys really took care of us.  Thanks a lot.  Yes, YSB, uh, completely hooked us. 
[00:11:00]  Yeah.  All over the place.  All right.  So, after the radio show yesterday, we went to the electric factory for,  I gotta say, probably one of the sickest roadshows we've been, uh, you know,  since we've been doing these things.  It was a pretty good one.  Uh, uh, some of the differences between the New York-Philly crowd.  I, I gotta give it to the Philly girls for wowing in the crowd.  Philly girls.  Right off the bat.  There have been some roadshows we go to in New York.  Ladies in New York, they butchered a shame.  I gotta, I gotta say it.  Mm-hmm. 
[00:11:30]  That figures.  Every single girl at the electric factory wowed.  Wowing from the balcony.  We go to, uh, uh, uh, roadshows.  We, we hold them here in New York.  Yeah, we see a lot.  You know?  But sometimes it's like pulling teeth, especially the beginning of the roadshow, to get women  to, uh, you know, make people happy by showing a little cannage.  These girls couldn't wait.  I think before we hit the stage, there was wowing in the balconies and everything.  Oh, they went like crazy way before we got there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Not in, not as much, uh, sexual debauchery during the bikini contest, though, than we 
[00:12:00]  do get in New York.  That's something, Philly, we're gonna have to work on for next time.  Well, yeah, we live and learn.  I think, uh, overall, though, it was an unbelievable show.  Oh, hell yeah.  Hell yeah.  I mean, we gotta go through the whole rundown.  And more video and snapshots were taken at this, uh, roadshow than any other.  Yep.  Any other.  And they're gonna be up all over the place.  Opie and Anthony.com should have some.  Yeah.  Uh, foundrymusic.com's gonna have all, all kinds of video later today.  That's L-O-U-N-D-R-Y music.com.  And, uh, it's gonna show up everywhere. 
[00:12:30]  And, dude, Philadelphia has gotta have a higher alcoholism rate than Ireland in the 1830s.  What a bunch of drunks.  Electric factory has got to be happy today.  They, they almost ran out of beer.  They did, too.  Look at this picture of Foundry Jeff.  Puking in the parking lot.  That's good.  That's what you just described.  Found that one on, uh, the message board.  The first shot, uh, the first set of pictures from us just hanging out in the studio, uh,  down there in Philly are up on opieandantony.com. 
[00:13:00]  And, uh, Scott's working on the roadshow pictures as well.  So, you can check out some of the images of, uh, of, uh, the radio show you were listening  to yesterday, okay?  I have no voice whatsoever.  There's no way I'm gonna make it to 7 o'clock.  That's rough.  But we will try.  It is rough.  Should we take a quick break and then hit, uh, hit the phones?  Cool, man.  All right, we're gonna regroup here.  Uh, the phones are just slamming.  Uh, we didn't take one phone call yesterday.  Because we were having too much fun and we had a weird phone system set up. 
[00:13:30]  Because a lot of people were wondering, hey, man, why didn't you, you know, talk to us yesterday?  You know, we just didn't have time.  There was so much debauchery going on in that studio yesterday.  So, we're gonna take a lot of phone calls today.  A bunch of people on hold that were at the roadshow.  Wish they were at the roadshow.  Want to talk about the radio show yesterday.  And we're gonna do that, uh, we're gonna do that next, okay?  Cool.  So, stay there.  Opie.  I'm the dick.  Anthony.  I'm an ass.  No one to turn here.  This is the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:14:00]  Why are you wasting your time with this sleazy trash?  People are starting to say funniest radio ever, so don't wreck you.  Uh, Anthony Bud Light.  Yes, Bud Light recognizes people, uh, from the Northeast see things a little differently.  Right?  Hmm?  You gotta, you gotta be creative to get, uh, those people's attention.  That's just what Bud Light's done.  Uh, Bud Light is the beer for fun and hanging out.  Oh, man.  We, we, we had the Bud Light on the stage last night.  Oh, hell yeah.  I think Bud Light was one of the big sponsors for our roadshow in Philly last night, so. 
[00:14:30]  Clean, crisp taste.  Made Bud Light the number one light beer in America.  And, uh, if you're going, uh, wherever you're going, you know?  The baseball playoffs, maybe.  Maybe you're just hanging out, having a party.  Watching the Yankees kick some worse.  Bud Light, the perfect companion.  Look for the new, uh, bottle.  It's a cool, new, clear plastic, uh, label.  There you go.  Bud Light.  You're gonna love it.  We do.  Drink it all the time.  For, so, uh, for the real taste.  Won't fill you up. 
[00:15:00]  Never lets you down.  Make it a Bud Light.  1027 WNEW.  Puddle of mod control.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  We got to, we, yes.  I just got to ask Norton something real quick about last night.  There's a girl, Marilyn from Philly, on Instant Feedback.  She's wondering, uh, why did you sign my breast?  And is this true?  You were signing women's breasts, Olivia Newton-John.  John, you sick son of a bitch.  Excuse me, that was the only breast I signed. 
[00:15:30]  Uh, Olivia Newton-John.  Olivia Newton-John, who, of course, had breast cancer.  Yeah, it was.  You are the sickest son of a bitch.  It's also a nice long name to write on a breast.  Yeah, you got to pick a long name.  I wonder when she, uh, discovered that it wasn't your name on the breast.  She was cool, though.  I hope she doesn't think that I was being mean to her.  That's funny.  That's a big, heavy heaver.  Yeah.  We got to get right into this and go right to the phones, finally.  Frank, what's going on?  What's up, guys?  Hey.  Oh, you sound great. 
[00:16:00]  Yo, last night was awesome.  Yeah?  Cool.  Dude, I am still hurting.  Yeah, who isn't?  Was that the first road show you've attended?  Oh, yeah, I'm from Philly.  It's the first one I've been to.  Oh, cool.  What was the highlight of the night?  For me?  Yeah.  I thought it was pretty funny when the lead singer from Octane took a full beer right  in the face.  That was pretty good.  People were, I can't even tell you how many beers were flung at each other, at the stage,  at certain people walking down the runway.  It was hysterical.  I can't, I don't know how many times we had to stop the whole show because they had to 
[00:16:30]  mop the stage.  It was awesome.  I think you two guys in Voss were the only people not hit with beers.  I know.  I think so.  Everyone's writing on instant feedback, throwing beer, always funny.  I was great.  Them and Voss were the smart ones, not like the idiot I am.  I walked out to the middle of the runway and I knew it was coming.  You just knew.  Yeah, you just know it's coming.  Yeah, we had like a Miss America runway, just in case you weren't there last night.  And I wasn't attempting the runway.  I walked out a few feet at some point, but I thought better of it and walked back to the 
[00:17:00]  stage.  A bunch of animals and we loved every minute of it.  When you guys told Patty to walk down the aisle and told everybody to throw beer at her,  that was so funny.  You know what?  We never said throw beer at Patty.  Anthony was waving his hands to throw beer at her.  My girlfriend was even laughing.  I might have winked really, really, really good there.  Patty came out in her super lady uniform.  She was dressed as Superman.  She had the little Superman suit on with muscles and everything. 
[00:17:30]  And she still looked like a nine-year-old boy body.  She calls herself super lady.  She wasn't super lady in her letter that she wrote to us.  So we had her go out there and walk all the way down the runway.  As she's walking out, she gets bombarded by beer.  So she comes running back kind of.  That's because she only made it a third of the way out.  Yeah.  That's important to the story because she started getting bombarded and she turned around  and said, all right, screw this.  And we're like, no, come on, Patty.  It's Philly.  They love you.  You guys, you're not going to throw any beer, right? 
[00:18:00]  Wink, wink.  Ant's doing the hand motion behind Patty's head.  And then she goes out for a second time.  We ask her to go all the way to the end because the people want to see you.  Second time, she didn't make it either.  No, she came running back, this time completely soaked in beer.  Right.  And she's like, it's in my eyes.  I can't see.  My eyes are burning.  So we were like, Patty, no, look, you've got to make it to the end of the runway.  People want to see you.  And at this point, people are going, there's no way she's going to do this again.  Right.  We know different.  Right.  She's like a beaten dog. 
[00:18:30]  I was waiting for Norris to come out and tackle Voss.  Nah.  So then Patty did it the third time and completely got drenched.  It was hysterical.  It was a great carry moment.  We finally had our carry moment with Stalker Patty.  There was a one-two punch thing where about half full cups of beer hit the left and right  side of her head and just like, and I was laughing so hard I couldn't even deal with it.  I'm telling you, there will be video up soon of this and you're not going to believe how  much beer was thrown at Patty and thrown at this road show in general. 
[00:19:00]  And this is what a creep aunt is because this is why they knew that if she walked out and  got beer thrown at her, she wouldn't make the second trip.  Yeah.  So it's the code word talking to the crowd.  He's going, no, they're not going to throw beer.  Let her get to the end of the runway.  Let her get to the end of the runway.  Yeah.  And then throw your beer.  And then she's trapped out there.  It was just great, guys.  I'm going to go listen to myself on the radio.  All right, Frank.  Thank you.  Take it easy.  Norton, you rule.  Thanks, buddy.  Norton, is this true?  You were signing men's yam bags, Richard Belzer? 
[00:19:30]  No?  Okay.  Hey, where's that picture?  There's a picture of Patty.  Huh?  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.com.  There's now a picture of Stalker Patty and her super lady outfit.  Super Patty.  That's before she got drenched by the beer, obviously.  What a retard she looks like.  It was a carry moment.  I couldn't be happier.  I'm super lady.  Hey, what's happening?  Hey, Rich Voss.  What's up?  Hey, Voss.  What's going on, man?  What a great time, huh?  Dude, you killed. 
[00:20:00]  Yeah, it was a lot of fun.  It was killed, man.  It was funny when we were setting up this road show for Philly.  Uh, Karen and Tim and the gang down there.  You know, we were trying to explain what we wanted to accomplish on the stage, and one  of the things is, we said, you know, we're friends with all the, you know, the comics  here in New York, and we want to bring a few down.  And, uh, they're like, oh, comics.  Comics.  Oh, that never works.  Especially down here.  We've never had any success with comics.  I got to tell you, Rich Voss went out and absolutely killed the hells.  Hey, let me tell you, I was pacing backstage, because that band did 45 minutes. 
[00:20:30]  Octane, and they were, like, high energy.  And I'm like...  It's pretty tough to follow that with, you know, with, uh, some jokes.  They rock.  Hey, let me tell you, that crowd was on fire.  This is what a zero I am.  We're at the dance club.  Everybody's getting lap dances, and I'm showing pictures of my kids to a dancer.  Oh, you are despicable with those kids.  You know, you really stink.  Hey, you know what?  I'm different than every other guy in here.  Nonsense.  They've heard it all.  Just rape them, stupid.  Yeah, but she took my number, pal. 
[00:21:00]  Oh, wow.  After what, 60 or 80 bucks?  No, I didn't know.  Took it.  You know what happens after a girl takes the number?  The conversation's over.  Yeah.  That's why she took your number.  Did she let you touch her for a dollar?  She was a nice girl.  Did she call you yet?  Huh?  No.  Of course not.  Here's my daughters.  Huh?  Here's my daughters.  This is the one I'm dodging, because I got more money.  Froy from Foundry is tipping with Jeffrey money, Toys R Us money.  Jeffrey money. 
[00:21:30]  He looks like he's 12 years old at a dance club.  Yeah, the funniest thing, Froy, who does, the guy looks like he's in his early teens.  Yeah.  As we were leaving, he's walking to the special room with this leggy blonde, and he's got 20 bucks in his hand, looking like the kid going to the candy store.  Oh, yeah.  His face was priceless.  We just turned around going, hey, have a good time.  And you're right, that kid, Jeff, was knocked out.  It was hilarious.  No, he was gone.  He was throwing up. 
[00:22:00]  You know.  He wrote he had, like, 25 beers.  He puked a few times.  He goes, I must have smelled like hot garbage.  Hot garbage.  Hot garbage and sizzling.  How great is the Philly audience?  They were really on fire.  Yeah, they're crazy.  They were just, and the girls were hot down there.  Yeah, some nice ones, and some pigs.  Yeah, well, you know, that goes without saying.  Which is always nice.  I like a little skank, you know, when there's a room full of women.  Yeah, it was a lot of fun.  Skank, nice.  Voss is the only comic that goes to a strip club to work on his material. 
[00:22:30]  Oh, please.  And he's got his pictures, though, of his kids.  What is that?  We're talking about kids, because, you know, she had a kid, and we're talking, and she goes,  hey, listen to me.  Everybody goes in there doing all the creepy stuff.  You've got to try a different angle.  You know what, you're that son of a bitch, though, Voss, that takes the girl's attention  away with your pictures of the kids, while the guys are standing around going, take your 
[00:23:00]  clothes off, let me see you shake your ass.  But, no, they're having a conversation with some guy.  Yeah, well.  Have you ever heard the nice guy rap before?  You're not a nice guy, Voss.  I really am a nice guy.  You're dirt.  I've known you better than anybody.  You're an awful man.  Did you rub behind your ear and have her smell it?  Yeah.  But why don't you show a picture of your kids to a girl after you've finished dumping  on her, right before you're ready to leave immediately?  Why don't the kid pictures come out then as soon as you're done and you're ready to go?  No, you don't need to show them.  You're done. 
[00:23:30]  I've changed.  I'm a lot different now.  You haven't changed.  You're awful.  Voss knew where all the peep boots are in Philadelphia.  The Whack Shacks?  Yeah.  The Whack Shacks.  The peep boots were and which boots had the holes cut in the middle.  Hey, I was driving home last night and I stopped at one, but it was closed.  Yeah.  I was really upset about it.  I had a lot of fun.  Thanks a lot, man.  We'll let you go.  You absolutely killed my friend.  Oh, thanks, man.  All right.  I'll talk to you later.  See you.  And a lot of people saying the Philly audience was unbelievable.  I got to tell you, so many people took the road trip from New York down to Philly. 
[00:24:00]  Oh, there were a lot of people from New York.  If I had to guess, it was probably like 70% Philly, at least 30% New York.  Yeah.  We're a New York audience.  Chuck from Philly, I'm a bouncer, cheerleaders, and Norton walked out with a huge wet spot on his pants.  Is that true?  Possible.  I didn't actually, like in New Orleans, when I actually, thank God, was able to, you know, complete.  Right.  But I wasn't able to, but, you know, sometimes a little prerequisite.  What's the word?  Just pre.  Just say pre. 
[00:24:30]  Yeah.  Pre-sauce.  Yes.  Pre-soak.  Pre-soak.  We're pre-murdering big body holes.  I mean, stuff comes out.  All right.  Eric, what's up?  What's going on, guys?  We're hanging.  Yeah.  I took the trip from Long Island yesterday to catch the show.  Oh, you did?  Yeah.  It was my first one ever.  I'm kind of a youngin', but I've been listening for a while.  I'm only 21, so I wanted to wait until I was actually able to drink at once.  Yeah. 
[00:25:00]  And, yeah, just a great show.  Listened to you guys for a while.  What's up with Lady Di and the other one?  They're a little, uh...  They're retarded.  That's why you call them the retarded of the village early.  Retarded.  The place went nuts when we brought them out, though.  They can't believe that these two are real.  Yeah.  I was one of those guys.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Finally, the picture I've been waiting to check out has arrived.  There is Stalker Patty at the end of the runway at the road show last night,  and there is beer in the air all over the place. 
[00:25:30]  Fuggin', fuggin', F-U-G-G-I-N, moron, from opianthony.com,  had a bunch of pictures from last night, and that's one of them.  It's Patty in just looking like a fire hose is his hitting her.  Where can people get that pic?  He's going to post them, and then we'll tell you where to go.  That's a great shot.  It looks like Wayne 327 in the Zapruder film.  Yeah, where the head, the mist of brain and blood is flying. 
[00:26:00]  That is what it looks like.  Trying to turn her head out of the way.  And the funniest part, look at everyone's hands.  Because that's everyone that was throwing a beer.  Yeah, they're not waving.  You see the release, they're not waving.  Their hands are out because a beer had just left their hands.  There's a cup in midair, another cup behind her shoulder.  We've got to capture that picture and put it on opianthony.com immediately.  Eric, thanks for traveling from Long Island down to Philly.  Yeah, thanks for having a great show, guys. 
[00:26:30]  Talk to you later.  Peace.  Let's move on to Aaron.  Aaron, you're next on the Opian Anthony show.  Hey, guys.  Actually, my question kind of just got answered.  I think I couldn't get to the show yesterday.  I was just trying to recreate it in my head and actually figure out if there were actual  cups of beer or just the beer.  Cups.  It was cups and cups of beer.  Yeah, it was the cups flying.  And you know how when a cup starts tumbling, some of the beer will spray out and it just  hit her.  And some of them were just cups hitting her in the head with beer in it. 
[00:27:00]  And if I can quote Norton, nice.  Yeah, it was a beautiful sight.  All right, guys.  Thanks a lot.  Have a good one.  All right.  My sides were hurting.  I was laughing.  I was at that point where you're laughing so hard you can't even breathe because she's  just getting pummeled.  And we sent her out again.  And she got pummeled.  And we got her to go out a third time.  I want to say it again.  The best way to describe it, it was a Carrie moment.  Yeah.  She was in front of a bunch of people.  She thought she was doing a really cool thing.  Look, I'm so humiliated.  She was completely humiliated.  I was laughing and cringing at the same time. 
[00:27:30]  Chris, what's going on?  What's going on, guys?  Hey.  I just got home today.  I was with the guy at Cheerleaders last night.  Which one?  The guy at the fire department had on.  Yeah, you guys were cool, man.  Oh, thanks, man.  I appreciate it.  I pegged Patty right in the head from the balcony.  Yeah, that's another thing.  Shots were coming from the balcony raining down on her, too.  She was getting hit from all angles.  It was great.  Hysterical, man.  And then the fire act.  That was terrible.  I loved the fire act. 
[00:28:00]  The fire act was all right.  I thought that was pretty cool.  The girls didn't do nothing.  They just held the flame.  I thought they were going to do some lesbian stuff or breathing or something.  Well, the electric factory, they worked with us because they didn't want any pirate techniques.  And they wanted us to cancel that part of it.  And then we worked it out.  And they said, okay, they can do a quick little thing.  And I thought it was cool.  It was a nice break in the action so they can mop up the stage.  Yeah, yeah.  Trillers was the highlight, though.  I got a picture Anthony knows about of you. 
[00:28:30]  So I got to mail that one to you guys.  He snapped a picture at the moment that that big muscle chick was trying to muscle in on you.  That was awful.  And he got a picture of you with that beast.  It was awful.  So we're eagerly waiting.  Hey, send that in.  We'll post it on OPEC.com.  I'm at the photo mat right now when it gets developed.  Oh, cool, man.  Thanks a lot, guys.  By the way, you know, for the new cities and stuff, when we do a road show and you guys  take your own personal pictures, send them in.  We'd love to see what, you know, everyone else's angle of the damn thing. 
[00:29:00]  And we'll post the best ones on our website.  So, all right.  Here's the guy that threw the beer at Norton when he was doing his set.  Norton killed as well out there.  Yeah.  Ozzy.  Hey, ONA.  What's up, man?  You guys rule, man.  Thanks.  Dude, I feared for my life last night.  I thought everyone was really cool, though, man.  I threw a beer at Norton.  Oh, okay.  He made eye contact with me, and I thought I was going to die.  Why'd you throw a beer at Norton?  I just screamed like the thing to do at the time. 
[00:29:30]  See, that's why, you know, it's funny.  At first, I got really pissed.  And then, like, when I saw a couple of people, they were laughing and having fun.  And I'm like, I knew it was going to come because it was, like, part of the festivities.  You know what it was?  It turned out to be, if you were getting a beer thrown at you, it didn't necessarily mean you sucked.  No, not at all.  It was like the audience, it was their way of showing love.  Yeah, affection.  But people like the retarded Laverne and Shirley, no, that was, we hate you, and throwing beer.  But then other people are getting hit because it's like, I love this guy.  Boom, I got a fire at him.  I got a fire at him.  Lynch is getting pelted. 
[00:30:00]  They're applauding a song and throwing beer.  Throwing beer.  Although Lynch said is another story in itself that we got to get to.  When did this trend start?  At the Vanderbilt?  Because some people were throwing beer at the Vanderbilt.  Oh, one.  Yeah, one.  And Bill got hit with it.  No, this was purely Philly.  Yeah, this was completely something I've never seen before.  There was an imaginary line on the stage, and the audience was just waiting for someone to step over that line.  Because they already sized it up. 
[00:30:30]  They're like, okay, they just have to step forward one more step, and we can throw.  They were cocked and ready.  Oh, yeah.  Let's see.  All right, Ozzy.  Thank you.  Not a problem.  Hey, guys.  Yeah.  By the way, big F you through the guy that elbowed me in the mouth on the mosh pit.  Well, that's what the mosh pit's all about, man.  Hey, Ben, thanks for the tickets, man.  All right, Oz.  All right, guys.  Take it easy.  Here's an observation about Voss.  The only reason Philly loved Voss is because his material was new to them. 
[00:31:00]  Oh.  He had some new, like, you know, Bin Laden stuff, Afghanistan stuff.  He had a really funny Afghanistan line.  Hold on a second.  Crazy Paul, what's up?  My phone's stuck.  Crazy Paul.  Yes.  Hey, man.  Crazy Paul.  His phone is stuck.  All right.  He wanted to say that people were using my car as a pot-smoking place.  A pot-smoking place.  What about the backstage?  Huh? 
[00:31:30]  Backstage.  Oh, my God.  It was out of control in that side room of all the idiots.  The Freak's room?  It reeked.  It was like a cloud coming out.  I know.  Well, in the back, Mark.  It got cloudy.  There were a few different dressing rooms and places to hang out.  There were beer in there and everything.  The O&A Freak's room where the busload of freaks and everybody stayed.  There was a foosball table in there, a bar, couches, chairs.  We had our dressing room and the couch and a nice big pail of beers and everything.  And the Freak's room with the foosball table and stuff, I saw the back corner. 
[00:32:00]  That's where Old Dirty and his posse were.  And it was just, it was like someone, a smoke machine under the couch.  That's what it looked like in that back corner.  And it would drift right out the front.  And the Old Dirty clone was there.  His brother.  His twin brother.  Who was freaking everyone out.  Freaked my brother out.  Old Dirty walks up.  Old Dirty has a twin that looks exactly like him.  To a tick.  That is mellow and he's behind the scenes, doesn't want any part of this.  But Old Dirty, you know, brings him out every once in a while. 
[00:32:30]  And it's really creepy.  They look exactly alike.  Yeah.  The only difference is Old Dirty's silent movie mustache.  He does have the silent movie mustache.  The Clark Gable.  Yes.  If he shaved that, they would look, I mean, it's identical.  My brother was hanging out in the back and Old Dirty comes up to him and goes,  Yo, Brother Joe, I'd like you to meet O.D.  And his brother came up and Joe's looking at both of them, not knowing that he was a twin  the whole time.  He said, I thought someone slipped me some acid. 
[00:33:00]  And I was freaking out for that split second.  He goes, it was freaking him out.  He thought he was on drugs.  Crazy Paul, what's up?  Yo, hey, first of all, I don't mind, you know, helping out and stuff like that.  But about 18 people from your staff and the staff over there were using my frigging car as an opium gun.  Well, Paul, have you looked at yourself in the mirror yet lately?  Yeah, why?  It's obvious that you're the guy to go to.  No, no, no, dude, I don't smoke cops in 76. 
[00:33:30]  Dude, including the town whose people I ain't going to mention, I came back five hours later.  I'm driving home, I'm stoned.  Hold on, someone is saying, though, you were inviting people to smoke in your car.  Orlando, what's up?  What's up?  Yeah, I was up in the studio and when Jim Brewer came, me and O.D., the guy just gave us his keys.  Get in the car and we just went nuts.  It was crazy.  Did you give people your keys?  Well, yeah, they didn't want to get them up to standing on the street corner.  I said, go in my car.  I figured, all right, one person's going to go smoke a dope.  Fine. 
[00:34:00]  There were nine people in my car.  Yep.  Cheech and chung.  Yeah, good time there, Paul.  All right, man.  Peace.  All right, man.  Peace.  Later.  Bye.  Norton, is this true?  What?  It's somebody here saying you were walking around telling the strippers you were Dr.  Pistone.  Are you doing that now?  I wish I would have thought of that.  Diana, what's going on?  Yeah, you guys.  Hey.  Yeah, I was down there wowing everybody in a ticket line and when I got there, I was up 
[00:34:30]  on the stage wowing everybody with my pierced nipples.  Cool.  Yeah, I remember you.  And then I ran to a guy from YSP.  Hold on, hold on.  I got to interrupt again, but we're going to go right back to you.  So, the picture of Stalker Patty getting pelted with beer is now up on opieandanthony.com.  It is?  Holy ass.  Look at that shot.  Wait till you see the video of that.  Yeah, man.  How classic is that?  Stink?  Look at midair cups.  opieandanthony.com, okay? 
[00:35:00]  And there's no way one person could have done all that damage.  To do all that, you need a triangulation of fire.  Right, right.  The true trajectory on her and just let loose.  It really looks like a wave of beer.  Diana, what's up?  So, continue.  Yeah, there must have been like 80 pictures taken of me, right?  Yeah.  But anyway, I met with this guy from YSP, right?  So, we decided to go in the bathroom to do it.  And, uh...  Hold on.  Hold on.  That's not something you just casually brought up there.  Hold on.  Back the truck up. 
[00:35:30]  So, you...  I sound like Peter Brady today.  You hooked up with someone from YSP.  Yeah, the guy's name is Brad.  He said, like, uh...  Taking me all around.  Like, I was on display with my breath, right?  So, then we decided to get hot for each other and went in the bathroom.  Rick, get him on the phone.  So, you decided to go in the bathroom.  Wait, who's Brad, though?  I don't know, but just get him.  Oh, okay.  All right, so you decide you want to do him?  Immediately, two bouncers walk in.  One's looking over the stall. 
[00:36:00]  The other one opens the door.  And we're like, aw, man.  So, we got kicked out.  Were you in the middle of doing it?  No, we didn't even get started.  Damn.  So, where'd you go?  In the ladies room.  No, I mean, where'd you go after that so you could finish?  Oh, we didn't.  Oh, that's too bad.  Oh, that sucks.  How do you do that?  Because I went back in.  You think you're going to get some, and, uh...  Oh, that blows.  I think that...  Were you wowing up by the stage when I was on stage?  Yeah, I do remember you.  They're both pierced nipples.  Yeah.  Nice.  Very nice.  Poor Brad. 
[00:36:30]  Thank you.  All right, Diana, thank you.  Bye.  I slammed his nuts in the car door.  She really knocked this thing down.  Typical chick.  I'll run back in and get another one.  Yeah.  That sucks.  She just decided she wanted to get laid, man.  She looked really drunk, too.  Young Buck checking in.  Young Buck.  What's up?  What's up, guys?  Hey, man.  Hey, man.  Hey, man.  Hey, man.  I'm hurting, dude.  Ears are ringing.  My stomach's all upset.  My throat's sore, man.  It was nuts last night, dude.  It was cool.  Oh, man.  Just crazy stuff.  What was the highlight for you, bro?  Oh, man.  I don't even want to start.  At first, I got to apologize to Norton, dude, on behalf of all of Philadelphia. 
[00:37:00]  All right, slow down.  I can't believe you got hit.  All right, hold on.  But, no, it's fine, dude.  It wasn't bad.  Hold on.  I got to interrupt again.  Good.  Because these pictures are coming in like crazy.  Because, I mean, we all just got back from Philly, and they're trying to post them as  fast as possible.  Can we get that up on OpieAndAnthony.com, Ben?  There's the picture of Old Dirty and his clone.  Oh, cool.  Go to OpieAndAnthony.com in a little while, and that'll be up, okay?  Old Dirty and Old Dirty 2.  I like that silent movie star mustache.  Dude, Old Dirty looks like a cross between Chuck E. Cheese or Rat and J.J. Walker. 
[00:37:30]  Oh, nice.  Jesus, man.  J.J. Walker's one of the security guards in our building.  We saw him yesterday.  Yo, I got to say one thing now.  You thought the same thing, right, Stig?  You got your badge?  Dino my!  We got to show, like, our badges and stuff.  And this guy they just hired looks just like J.J. Walker, man.  All right, Young Buck, continue.  I'm sorry.  All right, dude.  Days of the new, man.  Yo, when you guys left, dude, and signed off, everybody left, man.  Nah.  It was horrible, dude.  You know what?  I have to apologize to them. 
[00:38:00]  We sucked the energy out of that crowd, and they really insisted on going on at a certain  time.  And I'm thinking to myself, man, these guys got to get on soon.  I'm telling you.  Plus, it was late on a Wednesday, and people were drinking.  That was why a lot of people left, because it was, like, around midnight at that point,  or 1130.  People have to get up in the morning and go to work.  It's a Wednesday night.  Yeah.  At this point, you know, everyone saw, like, three hours of just flat-out debauchery.  It's just crazy.  Dude had, like, what's it called?  Platform shoes on, because he's, like, five foot tall. 
[00:38:30]  Yeah.  He's wearing, like, structure boxers with, like, a fishnet shirt.  He's just weird, dude.  Who, Travis?  Yeah.  He's all right, though.  Yeah, he's pretty cool.  All right, cool, bro.  All right, man.  Thank you.  Later on.  Tom from Teaneck wants to contribute a bad day, worst day.  A bad day.  You get a chick in the bathroom to do you, and the bouncer reens it.  Worst day.  It's announced the next day on the air, and your wife finds out.  She gave his name, his place of employment.  Very discreet of you, stupid. 
[00:39:00]  Len, what's going on?  Hello, guys.  What's going on?  Hey, bro.  I'm a little banged up, so bear with me.  Who isn't, man?  Just a couple of quick shout-outs.  First, Voss and Norton, you guys killed.  They totally killed, man.  Unreal.  Second thing, how hard does Octane rock?  Yeah, they kicked ass, man.  That was a pleasant surprise, because when we put this together, you know, this band,  Octane, wanted to play.  We were like, ah, cover band.  Oh, come on.  You know what I mean?  We're thinking John Mellencamp and crap.  These guys just rocked hard and were really good.  Yeah, they're phenomenal. 
[00:39:30]  Third thing, just to let you know, with Stalker Patty, that wasn't all beer that was making  its way up to the stage.  That was recycled beer on the old floor.  Yeah, because no one could go to the bathroom in the front of the stage, because it was so  packed in.  And I've been in that position, that show, is, I mean, you do what you got to do, man.  Oh, some of the yellow discipline.  Oh, nice.  All over.  Yeah, those nice big 20-ounce cups, they still have really good.  Real quick, and they fly real hard.  Oh, wow.  And I was right on the corner of the stage, right at the end of the runway, so, I mean, 
[00:40:00]  I got a full facial plant on her.  Oh, God.  Stalker Patty with the facial.  That's classic.  Wow.  So, hey, you guys rock.  Carry on, Pools.  All right, Lynn.  I was looking at some of the people there, and the people right up front against the barricade,  they couldn't move.  No.  That was it.  Once you're there, you're not getting beer, you're not taking a leap.  And they were soaked, too, because the beer was flying over the runway to the other side  of the crowd.  It was, it was.  Oh, they were flinging at each other. 
[00:40:30]  Oh, I know.  It was amazing.  Toward the end of the night, I started going around to the dressing room.  I knew that we were going to be leaving soon, and there was still plenty of beer left,  so I started bringing beer out, opening it up, pouring it in cups, and giving it to the  people in the front.  And some of the animals are reaching up to grab it, and it's just flying over chicks'  heads in the front row.  I'm like, don't spill it on the girls, man.  Just drink it.  They were throwing beer at the chicks, the hot bikini chicks.  Oh, yeah.  I mean, hot chicks, and these maniacs are just flinging beer and laughing. 
[00:41:00]  They wanted to see some bush.  We still got to talk about that.  There's so much more we got to talk about from last night.  Chris, what's up?  Yo, what's up, guys?  Hey.  I just wanted to say I was up in the balcony last night.  Hold on.  You know, this show's going way too fast.  I will go to you next, Chris.  Hold on.  All right, cool.  Because Brad is now calling in.  Brad is the guy that was trying to bang Diana in the bathroom, and they got caught.  Oh, okay.  Check this story out.  Brad, what's up?  Not much, man.  How you guys doing?  All right.  So is Diana telling the truth?  She dragged you into the bathroom to get laid? 
[00:41:30]  Well, I walked in the door, and she comes up to me and wows me.  So I was like, well, cool.  So I picked her up and let everybody else see.  And she said, do you work for YSP?  I said, sure.  I told her I was an intern, so she ended up hanging out with me all night.  And then, like, we got blitzed, and we went in the bathroom.  And then next thing I know, these two black guys just barge in and, you know, throw us out.  And then we went back to my car.  And she was lying her ass off, dude.  We went back out to my car and finished the hardcore. 
[00:42:00]  You finished hardcore.  Dude, you don't work for YSP?  He's using it.  Wow.  Good for you.  Great use of a radio station for sex.  And now the Brad at YSP is going, whew.  Good for you.  Yeah, you know.  I don't even think there is the Brad at YSP.  Who knows?  Who cares?  That's so great you lie.  Good for you.  That is good.  All right, Brad.  Very good.  All right, man.  Yo, you guys rule.  I had the best on my list last night.  Sounds like it.  Cool, man.  You guys showed us a good time, too, so thank you.  Finished it hardcore. 
[00:42:30]  What a genius to think on his feet.  Do you work for YSP?  Sure.  Sure.  Yeah, I do.  Let's go F.  Chris, what's up?  Yeah, I was up on the balcony last night.  Yeah.  And I just got to say that when it first started, it looked like Afghanistan night vision.  Cluster bombs everywhere.  Some of the buster busters.  Beers were being thrown completely upright.  And just coming straight.  Like, you can't stress that enough, how the beers were just going, just smashing in people's faces.  And usually when beer is flying that badly, there's going to be fist fights.  Oh, absolutely. 
[00:43:00]  Everyone was so freaking cool about it.  And then the girls, the bikini girls were coming out, and they were just getting pelted because they wouldn't wow.  Well, most of them did.  Even if they did, they got pelted.  It didn't matter at that point.  Yeah.  And Stephen Lynch is playing Kill a Kitten, and he realizes there's a guy behind him mopping the stage.  Yeah.  Because we've got an inch thick, deep puddle of beer.  Well, that's what we want to bring up.  Stephen Lynch, he had a tough spot, man.  He went on stage.  He's playing his tunes that kill.  And there's a guy that could care less, you know, mopping the stage, getting, I think, Days of the New ready. 
[00:43:30]  Yeah.  And Stephen's like, how do I compete against a guy that's mopping a stage behind me?  He just stopped mid-song, turned around, saw the guy mopping and didn't know what to do.  And then Brother Joe jumps on one of those Razor rollerboard scooters and almost breaks his leg, almost kills himself.  Because the beer was all over the stage, so the damn thing, you know, knocked out from under him, and he's on the ground.  And Psycho Mark's chick starts dancing on the stage also when Lynch is playing.  Right.  And she's gyrating and dancing on the stage, and the crowd all of a sudden starts going, boo, boo. 
[00:44:00]  So she, in case of emergency break glass, she takes her shirt off.  Right.  Yeah!  Turned him around in a second.  And there's Lynch.  Just, he stopped playing.  Yeah.  All right.  We have to take another break.  What a mess.  We should tell everyone who wasn't at the Roadshow how the Roadshow started.  Yeah.  Brother Joe came up with a great bit to start off the festivities.  Yeah, we had fun.  He's feeling it today.  Yeah.  We should get him on the line, because he's got some bruises. 
[00:44:30]  And we'll tell you what he did next, okay?  Can I tell him that maybe there wasn't some beer in those cups?  Oof.  If you like, Bill.  We'll be back.  New York Shock jocks Opie and Anthony are now on the air.  Welcome to the wonderful world of Balloon Not Pleasure.  Yeah, if you need lube, you're a loser.  Take it like a champ, okay?

[00:46:00]  And we're back with the O&A show.  Pretty much going over the debauchery that was the Philly Roadshow yesterday.  Hot Liz is on the phone in.  Liz!  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Oh, I'm struggling.  Did you guys know that those big beers they were throwing, they were charging $8.50 apiece  for them?  Oh, man.  People were throwing $9 beers at all of them. 
[00:46:30]  Oh, my.  Yeah, you got pelted a few times.  I got pelted quite a few times.  They were like $8.50 apiece?  $8.50.  Keith told me that on the ride home today.  Keith was telling me that they were paying $8.50 apiece.  Your rack looks very solid.  It's ridiculous.  I mean, they have to like us if they're throwing $9 beers at us, you know?  I'm assuming they love us.  And it's amazing how a crowd will turn on me, too.  Well, yeah, that's all in love, though, man.  You went out when Lynch was playing, and they gave you applause right when you came out. 
[00:47:00]  Then they started booing you, and then you ripped your shirt off, and they were in the  palm of your hands again.  Yeah.  Well, I'm female, and I know how to use it.  What can I say?  All right, Liz.  All right.  You guys are the best.  Bye.  Thanks, Liz.  There she goes.  John, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on?  You tell us.  I was at the show last night.  Yeah.  That absolutely rocked.  Oh, that chick who won the best for the bikini contest. 
[00:47:30]  Oh, yeah.  The Stars of the Stripes.  Oh, my God.  I kept on screaming out number one, too.  Well, she won.  She was pretty good.  Yeah, she was awesome.  We're still going through our pictures.  Those pictures will be up soon.  I mean, we're adding to opieandanthony.com as we go along with the show today, so bear  with us.  The best thing that happened?  Yeah.  Right?  Yeah.  John.  Yeah, yeah.  The best thing that happened was my girlfriend drove me down there.  John, John, no one cares now.  I got to tell you and everyone else, we have no energy today. 
[00:48:00]  Don't suck the energy out of the show today.  Help us out.  Keep the energy high, all right?  Oh, man.  So if you've got something to say.  Well, you didn't want to hear the end of the story, I guess.  No, go with it.  Go.  Okay.  Well, I came home last night.  I was so horned up from...  Oh, John.  John.  I got some backdoor action.  My girlfriend gave me some backdoor action.  There you go.  Thank you, John.  Backdoor action.  I'm so happy about that.  Can you sit down today?  Yeah. 
[00:48:30]  All right.  Oh, look at me being funny.  Brother Joe's on the line.  Got to give him props.  He came up with a great opener for the road show.  Yeah.  He figures with Osama bin Laden and everything else that he'd dress up just like Osama bin Laden.  He had everything.  Looked just like him from his speeches.  And go out on the stage and kind of do a hack comedy routine.  Hack comedy routine or something, which was awful, and people start pelting him with stuff. 
[00:49:00]  Kind of like what Voss does when he's at Caroline's.  Right.  You know, when Voss just calls it in when he does a stand-up here in New York.  Someone about Voss, Ernie O. writes, Voss got laps in Philly?  Wow.  I guess Philly really is the city of brotherly love.  Anyway, sorry.  I got it.  Yeah.  So he's doing that shtick and the people just hating him.  He also, which was like, I can't believe he went this far.  He got some, a bunch of sweet and low and poured it in his hand. 
[00:49:30]  And as he came out, he starts throwing it into the crowd going, breathe deeply, everybody.  It's okay.  I hope someone got a shot of that.  Awful.  I hope someone got a shot of the powder in the air.  So as they're hating him and he's doing his shtick.  He was getting pelty.  Oh, yeah.  That's when the beers just first started flying.  That probably set the tone of the night right there.  Yeah.  With the beer throwing.  And the crowd just screaming.  So then I came out with a camis and a paintball gun. 
[00:50:00]  Semi-automatic.  Constant air.  This thing was just set up to kill.  And I pelted him with what had to be about 12 shots.  Did people realize in the crowd that Joe was getting shot by paintballs on the stage?  Oh, yeah.  All right.  I hope so.  Joe told me this thing is 300 feet a second.  This thing's insane.  Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.  And I'm just laying him into him.  And you were shooting on point-blank range at one point.  Yeah.  Well, he said, I fell down. 
[00:50:30]  He goes, I didn't just fall down because I thought I should die at this moment.  He goes, I fell down so you would stop shooting me.  And as he's down, I just kept pumping closer and closer.  You've got to see the welts on Brother Joe's body.  Anyone get pictures of the welts?  Oh, I don't know.  Yeah, we ought to have him take a few snapshots of his welts.  He will.  Let's say hi to Brother Joe.  Joe.  Oh, man.  Joe, great opening last night, man.  Thanks, Bill.  Thanks.  Yeah, it was something that I was thinking about for a while. 
[00:51:00]  I ended up going to my girlfriend's brother, who's heavily into paintball.  Yeah.  And he's got a monster gun.  This thing is like state-of-the-art, best-you-can-buy, 300 feet per second.  And unbeknownst to me, the constant air tank, the CO2 tank, the screws on the back, was at a full charge.  I was fully charged.  I didn't know this.  68-caliber paintball.  And they felt like the first few weren't bad because you were hitting me like on a double linen. 
[00:51:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, like almost a vest thing on and stuff.  Forget it, man.  I was hitting them on that.  A couple of them snuck through and hit my stomach.  Yeah.  And I made the mistake of turning around.  Where's that picture?  Yeah, the pictures of what we're describing right now will be up on opianthony.com in a few minutes.  Great.  Dude, it felt like.  Firing at his own brother.  That is a creepy shot right there.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:52:00]  Look at that.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, here's a shot of me.  The weapon's up.  I'm pumping shots into you.  That is a paintball gun just firing away.  That's not a prop gun.  And Joe's looking like, ah!  What I did today, today I brought it into work, right?  I had it in the truck, and I was at work.  And we have these heavy, heavy corrugated boxes that, you know, we ship material in and stuff.  And I set one of them up to show my friend Jim that I work with, you know, just how hard this thing hits. 
[00:52:30]  The paintballs went through the boxes.  They didn't even splatter.  They went through.  And by the way, Bill, that's why I did that at the beginning of the night so no one would throw pee at me.  I'm just busting your chowls, brother.  I know, brother.  Yeah, so now the ones that hit on some of the area that was a little bit thicker in material than the others,  you got hit on the leg, which was nothing more than a sheet between his bare leg and the paintball.  And that one was, somebody told me last night, was oozing blood. 
[00:53:00]  Looks like Pat Croce's leg.  Had a big bump on it.  It was red enough to make it look like it was, yeah.  But, I mean, remember when we used to play the game?  I mean, I would stuff bunkers all the time.  Yeah.  So I would get pummeled all the time.  But those were like old Nelspot 007.  Yeah, these little guns that didn't really work very well.  This one, high tech.  Well, you took the hits, Joe, and it looked great.  Joe, are you wearing a cup?  No, I wasn't.  Luckily, nothing hit me in that area. 
[00:53:30]  He was really confident that after about 20 beers, I would still have some accuracy.  Yeah, you did, though.  I mean, you hit me in the right spot until I turned around and fell down.  And then when you walked up to me, I'm laying on the ground.  I'm going, if you fire at me a point blank, when we get out of here, I'm going to kill you.  I'm going to kill you.  Because, I mean, you walked like you were standing right over me at one point.  Yeah, I was going to pop it in your head.  Joe, Ant told me one more beer and he was going to.  One more beer, I would have done the execution to the back of the head. 
[00:54:00]  Holy S, how pissed was that crowd when I walked out?  I know, they were screaming.  Well, you got the reaction you were looking for.  Yep, absolutely.  It was weird.  I've got to mention something else that Brother Joe did, a great version of Star Spangled Banner.  The C-word song didn't go over as well in Philly.  Like, when you sing that in New York, everyone sings along.  You sang that down in Philly last night, and everyone was just staring at you like,  am I hearing what I'm hearing?  Yeah, the deer caught in the headlights. 
[00:54:30]  Well, I had all, like, maybe ten girls in the audience looking at me like I had two heads,  and some of the guys were laughing, and most of them were just looking at me like they had no clue what I was doing.  It definitely went over well, but it was just a different feel, because in New York, it's a sing-along.  Well, everyone knows in New York.  It's kind of new to Philly.  But then he gets out and picks up the guitar and does Jimi Hendrix's version of Star Spangled Banner.  Yeah, the banner went great, man.  They were lighting lighters and stuff.  It was pretty cool.  They got loud for that one. 
[00:55:00]  Had the feedback crank in.  It was nice.  Yeah, it was good, man.  I had a blast, fellas.  Yeah.  All right, Joe.  We'll do it again, man.  All right.  Thank you, bro.  All right, boys.  See you later.  There he goes.  He's hurting.  I saw Joe's welt in the bathroom, and he really got shot.  Isn't that something?  That's a great shot.  I hope he takes pictures of the welt, because it's pretty incredible.  Louie, what's up?  Hey, Opie.  Anthony, everybody, what's up?  Hey, how are you, man?  Anyway, you just start your little call here.  Hold on, Louie.  I've got to interrupt you and update the pictures of Anthony shooting his own brother on the stage. 
[00:55:30]  You're now up on opiananthony.com.  The pictures we got so far, they're a little blurry.  We'll get clearer ones, but we're just trying to throw as much stuff up as possible.  You get the idea, though.  All right, go ahead, Louie.  Yeah, man, I'm so blasted.  I had a great time last night.  I just can't even remember the chick that I banged last night.  I can't even remember what she looked like.  Let's just hope she was a chick, my friend.  I hope so, too. 
[00:56:00]  All right.  I was blasted.  Great party, man.  That's all you got?  Huh?  That's it?  No, let's play some broad bingo.  Not today.  Not today?  No.  All right.  We will talk about other things, but we're just trying to make sure we get all of this out there.  Stalker Patty.  Hi.  How are you?  Hey.  How are you?  Hi.  I just found out what those cups were.  It's a good thing I took that 15-minute shower afterwards that they had in the back. 
[00:56:30]  They had the showers and the towels.  Yeah.  I deserve a U2 concert for that.  No, you don't.  Hold on.  Ben, Ben.  We'll add something to that.  Patty, by the way, there were people using those showers to relieve themselves.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm sorry.  You didn't get it all off.  I forgot about that.  Your hair must be very shiny today.  A lot of people.  No, the water came from above.  A spigot from above.  You can't do that up.  It's Super Patty.  I'm not Super Lady of Wonder Woman.  So you still have your Super Lady suit? 
[00:57:00]  Yeah.  It's going to be dry clean.  I'm going to reuse it.  Reuse it.  Patty, the only thing that could have been funnier in that outfit would be if you fell  off a horse and broke your neck.  Oh, no.  I don't think that's funny, Jim.  You don't really mean that.  I do, and it's hilarious.  It is hilarious.  Hey, Patty?  Yeah?  You know, that suit has special powers, and it can make you fly.  I don't think so.  Next time you come here, can we take you to the roof and demonstrate it?  No, that's okay, Anthony. 
[00:57:30]  I know you can't really fly.  Yeah.  I'm a kiss.  Yes.  I can separate facts from fiction.  So, Patty, you looked like you were in pain when some of that beer was getting in your  eyes.  Yeah, it was.  My eye was burning.  It really was beer because, you know, it really stopped.  Believe me, I had both substances in my eyes.  Beer doesn't burn as bad as the kidney waste.  Trust me.  Well, anyway, I'm just glad I took that shower. 
[00:58:00]  Yeah, so is everybody else that was looking in and taking naked pictures of you.  No, they weren't.  The door was locked.  How was the ride back to New York, Patty?  Well, I was asleep much at the time, so I didn't wake up until we got back to New York.  That's where we got that great picture of old, dirty teabagging her when she's asleep.  No, he wasn't even on the bus.  Were you dreaming about onions?  No.  I was just drifting off the sleep because I was tired.  Did he put a yam in each eye and lay the most of his junk down your nose and give you 
[00:58:30]  the Roman war helmet?  No, he didn't.  He wasn't even on the bus.  Tinkle makes the sleep.  Well, Patty, I want to thank you for being the laughing stock of the party last night.  Yes.  Yes, I was quite a sport.  Yes, you were quite a sport.  Yeah, so I should have gotten the $1,000.  Oh, please.  Okay.  All right, super lady.  Well, I'll see you.  Have a good day.  There she goes. 
[00:59:00]  Bye-bye.  Everyone's favorite humiliated woman.  Super lady.  Abby.  All right.  The phones are just slamming.  Chris, what's up?  Yo, ONA.  We're making up for the fact we didn't take one call yesterday.  Chris.  Yo, ONA.  Yeah, what do you got to add to this?  Great show, man.  The dude throwing the powder.  Hey, you can't use that S word, people. 
[00:59:30]  Oh, my fault, fellas.  Yes, Philly does definitely love you.  And yes, them big beers were $8.50 apiece.  Hundreds of them were being thrown.  You got pictures of Joe throwing the powder?  Yeah.  Oh, cool.  Send them to the crowd.  Nice miss of it.  Send them in, man.  We encourage you guys to send in the good pictures that you took.  Not all the blurry ones because you were hammered and you couldn't focus your camera.  Yeah, right.  All right.  Great show all around. 
[01:00:00]  All right, Chris.  Thank you.  See you.  Bye.  Everyone just got so trashed.  You can tell from the listeners, too.  They're all calling the same way.  Hey, what's up?  You got that hangover voice.  Jason?  Yeah.  What's up?  You're next on the Opie and Anthony show.  Hey, not much, man.  Hey, I was just going to find out if you guys ever got the chance to find out if Travis  Nix drank more than four beers.  It looked like he was right at four.  Yeah. 
[01:00:30]  Yeah.  No, he even told us right before he went on stage that he had three.  He had three, and he had the fourth in his hand.  Yeah.  So, those guys rocked last night as well.  Really?  You know, I'm out here in Columbus, man, and I started catching you guys on the show, and  I really think it's a great show, and I'm really looking forward to some time you guys  making a big road show out here in Columbus.  As soon as we know we have an insane following in Columbus, we'll be there.  Hell, yeah.  That's how we do it.  Well, cool deal.  All right, Jason. 
[01:01:00]  Well, thanks, man.  Thank you.  Keep going.  So, the Patty pictures, I haven't seen some of that drenched with liquid on a stage since  Flashdance.  I'm a maniac, maniac.  Dude, you guys had a road show?  Yeah, Mark.  Hey, Mark.  What's going on?  What's up?  I was going to say that was the best watching Patty just get duked out there.  Not only once, but twice.  Three times.  Three times, my friend.  And second one, on the stage the whole time, running up to the edge of the stage, giving  the people a gack, gack, gack. 
[01:01:30]  The pastor's just seeing these people spend $8 on beers.  Keith reminded me of this.  He goes, they spent $8 a piece on those beers and fully hocked full beers at Patty.  That's why I think it might have been the actor product more than the beer.  Yeah, because you know people probably...  Hold on.  Someone wants to call you an idiot.  Hey, Mark.  Yeah?  Do you have a shut-off switch?  Do I have a shut-off switch? 
[01:02:00]  Dude, that last hour of radio they did at YSP, all you heard in the background was this  slow drone of gack, gack, gack, gack, gack.  Oh, I was bombed by that.  I only drank about 15 Sam Adams.  I'm so funny.  Like, you know, you repeat the same line over and over again.  You know, I said something that might have been funny, but I don't know.  Wait a minute.  Time on a second.  What is this rank on me day?  I just wondered, I've come jerk of jerks.  No, it's not rank on you day, Mark.  All right, well, fine.  I mean, what is it, line up and have a beef with me? 
[01:02:30]  No.  That's what we're talking about the road, Joe.  Not at all.  I'm just saying that listening to, like, a show, you might want to actually listen to  the people that are talking in front of the microphones and not somebody that's in the  background trying to get some kind of random drunken stone point in.  What are they doing to you, Steve?  Over and over again.  Jeez.  Well, obviously, I still have friends at N.E.W.  It's nice to talk with you guys.  Gack, gack, gack.  All right.  Jeez.  Well, jeez, nice talking with you.  Oh, jeez, Mark.  Mark, you don't take this crap personally. 
[01:03:00]  What's wrong with you?  What are you talking about?  I'm all over there.  I thought we were talking about the road show.  Who cares what I was screaming about?  I was senselessly babbling.  Well, Steve cared because he's basically saying that you ruined the last hour of the radio  show.  I ruined the last hour of the radio.  Oh, I don't know.  That's what I heard.  Well, that's what you're saying.  I'm sorry that day.  You know, I'm sorry for showing up.  I didn't notice.  Jeez.  All right.  Jeez.  Nice to get picky with you guys.  Have fun.  It wasn't us.  It was Steve who took the shot at you.  Whatever.  I mean, come on.  I mean, I don't even know why I got to get shot there. 
[01:03:30]  What the hell would I do deserve that?  Because he wouldn't shut up.  Wait.  You guys were listening to the show back here in New York and you could just hear him in  the background?  He was just all in the background.  Where's John?  All right.  I had no idea, Mark.  Wait.  Here's John.  Yeah.  I was running the board for you guys here and from like 630 till the end, you just hear  Oh, he hung up.  He hung up.  Oh, you push.  Why is he hanging up?  Well, he sounds like annoyed today or something. 
[01:04:00]  What's the deal?  He usually doesn't take that crap personally.  All right.  Let's move on to Brent.  Brent, what's going on?  Yeah.  What's going on, guys?  Hey.  Yeah.  Great show last night, man.  Yeah.  We had fun.  I just have one complaint, though.  Yeah.  The judges for the bikini contest.  Yeah.  Are you kidding me, man?  This is the wrong message.  Letting the girl that didn't even take her top off.  I wanted Alicia, but the first girl won.  I forgot her name already.  Yeah.  Laura Lay or whatever her name is.  Laura Lyon.  You know what, dude?  Laura Lyon.  Normally, I would agree with you, but she was so hot in that bikini. 
[01:04:30]  It doesn't matter.  It sends the wrong message, man.  It does.  You set a precedent like that, and it's a bad thing.  I agree with this guy.  You know it should be skin to win.  I wanted some Bush being shown there.  But Alicia had a whole lot of hurt going on south of the border.  Well, yeah, but that would send a positive message to the next time that you've got to show some skin to win.  How about that one with the towel on?  Oh, man.  Some of them brought it.  It was like they were popping kids out like Ted's dispensers. 
[01:05:00]  I'd be kidding.  Some of them.  But that girl who won, man, she had that little thin bikini.  I thought she was phenomenal, man.  And they were just juggling perfectly.  Hey, man.  She had a great body.  And I have no problem that she won.  Yeah.  No, I really don't either.  The only girl there worthy of wearing the G-string she had on because it was just cranked.  All right.  Well, next time.  Great show, guys.  Next time.  I mean, I don't think anyone was complaining.  There was plenty of nudity there.  Oh, yeah, definitely. 
[01:05:30]  All right, Brent.  Thank you.  I'll see you.  I can't wait to see the picture of Lady Di.  She entered the Stars of Strip.  Oh, God, is that heinous.  Those two mutants were so drunk, just disgusting drunk by the end of the night,  that when we were leaving, we went to go to the strip club.  Now, beforehand, we get done on stage.  Days of the New are jamming.  I go back to the freak's dressing room there to play some foosball  because there's a foosball table back there.  We were having some fun, man.  Three goalies.  Three goalies. 
[01:06:00]  Three goalie.  I know.  I like the three goalie thing.  Well, not my table, so I don't care.  I had fun.  I was having some fun last night.  So Lady Di is just screaming,  Anthony, Anthony, there's someone that wants to meet you outside.  There's someone that wants.  Anthony, there's someone that wants to meet you.  Anthony, Anthony, there's something.  Holy Jesus, I wanted to smack her in the head.  I'm trying to play foosball.  I'm having a good time.  And she's just rigging, rigging, babbling.  I told her, shut up.  Shut up.  I'm playing.  But there's somebody up.  I don't care. 
[01:06:30]  Bring them in here.  I'm playing.  She would not stop.  Then she goes, all right, me and Marion are leaving.  I'm like, thank God.  She goes, I want a hug.  Now, picture this.  There's Lady Di.  Drunk off her ass.  She spreads her arms apart to start walking toward me.  And she leads with her bunt.  She sticks it out.  She sticks it out.  Her arms are open, but her pelvis is way out in front.  And it's moving back and forth like a dodo bird. 
[01:07:00]  Like she's shaking it, yeah.  Like a dodo bird.  She's shaking it and coming towards me, staggering.  I was just like, oh, my God.  Get away.  I got me a man.  Yeah, exactly.  So she grabs me.  And the first thing that hits me is that meaty bunt.  It hits me midsection, and I was disgusted.  And then she's trying to give me a kiss, and she does this kiss thing where she's trying to wipe her lips on me. 
[01:07:30]  Like wipe them.  Yes, both above and below.  The way she's shaking.  And I'm just like, I almost pulled a Linda Blair where my head went completely around, trying to get my head away from her.  And the bunt, and she's shaking it and moving, gyrating.  Gyrating, that's what she was doing.  Gyrating.  Gyrating.  Yeah.  There's a picture that someone showed, because everyone had digital cameras backstage and stuff.  It'll be posted somewhere.  Lady Di hugging me, and she was choking me out and had no clue. 
[01:08:00]  I felt like it was Stevie Richards all over again.  How are you?  You've got to see the shot.  It's hilarious, and I'm being choked out again.  I had to walk away from them after I was in the dressing room with Voss talking.  And then the idiot wanted me to sign the penthouse article.  So she's like, would you sign my penthouse?  And I'm like, all right.  And she brings it over.  And she doesn't have a pen.  I'm like, we'll do it later.  And then 20 minutes later, she comes over.  Could you sign it?  And I'm like, all right.  Do you have a pen?  No.  I had to walk away from them.  They just wouldn't shut up. 
[01:08:30]  Yeah.  In the middle of the broadcast at YSP yesterday, at the end of the show, she was like peeking in the door going,  could you get Brewer's autograph?  Could you get?  We're busy here.  We're doing a show.  They have no clue.  They have no concept of what we try to do on the air.  They did the ID for us yesterday.  Oh, where is that?  Can we play that again?  This is how retarded these two are.  They did an ID for us where, you know, we have guests that come in and they go into the production studio  and record a, hi, you're listening to Opie and Anthony kind of thing on whatever station. 
[01:09:00]  And so the YSP guy got the retarded Laverne and Shirley to go in and record one of these IDs for us,  thinking that they were just an act.  And they would go in there and go, okay, what do you want?  You know, we'll do that.  I'll be retarded Laverne.  You're retarded Shirley.  We got this together and stuff.  You know, like they're pros.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  No, he realized.  He even realized, oh, my God, it's for real.  They're retarded.  And this is some of the tape he got.  Yeah, it's Ed, actually.  He's a really good guy down there.  I worked with him in Buffalo a long time ago. 
[01:09:30]  Buffalo.  Hey, you had enough beer.  We're here to do things.  What am I here?  I'll say.  Okay.  Hi, this is the.  Don't give me a go.  Hey, hi, it's the retarded Laverne.  Oh, we have to do it together?  Yes.  Hey, this is the retarded Laverne show.  The Opie and Anthony show.  And you're listening to Eagle Tears football on W94, WYSB.  I've got to stop it already. 
[01:10:00]  How retarded are they?  That guy must have looked like the guy in a sound booth with a silver screen submarine band.  Hi, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Oh, man.  You're going to do the retarded Laverne show together.  And then maybe you can take the rest of the line.  And then she can take the, you know, the second one.  Okay.  I'll do that.  I'll do that.  But you have to do the intro together.  Okay.  This don't work either.  All right.  You go first.  All right.  Hey, this is the retarded Laverne and Shirley from the Opie and Anthony show.  And you're listening to the Eagles football on 94 WYSB. 
[01:10:30]  Hey, this is the retarded Laverne and Shirley from the Opie and Anthony show.  And you're listening to Opie and Anthony on 94 WYSB.  What do you think?  Can I get you guys just together to say, hey, it's the retarded Laverne and Shirley.  Yeah, I know.  She backed away.  Just say that.  Don't back away, Diane.  Okay, right.  Hey, this is the retarded Laverne and Shirley.  From the Opie and Anthony show.  And you're listening to the Eagles football on 94 WYSB.  Is that good? 
[01:11:00]  Yeah, that was all right.  All right.  Thank you.  Now, the next one.  Hey, this is the retarded Laverne and Shirley.  And you're listening to Opie and Anthony on 94 WYSB.  In Philadelphia.  Can you guys just say together, hey, it's the retarded Laverne and Shirley.  That's all he wanted.  Okay.  All right.  Ready?  Three, two, one.  Hey, it's the retarded Laverne and Shirley.  Record?  Yeah.  All right.  Okay.  Thanks.  Thank you.  Good morning.  Thank you, girls.  Goodbye.  The funniest thing was, all he wanted that whole time was for them to go, hey, it's the retarded 
[01:11:30]  Laverne and Shirley together.  That's it.  And then one of them would say something about Eagles football, and one would say YSP.  But they couldn't figure it out.  And now they think they're stars, too.  And then the only way they could do it is, hi, this is the retarded Laverne and Shirley.  You are listening to the Opie and Anthony John.  The created monsters.  I got to tell you, Colin Quinn is obsessed with them.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  And how perfectly awful they are.  Yeah, of course.  Colin Quinn loves the retarded Laverne and Shirley. 
[01:12:00]  He's obsessed with how terrible they are.  He laughs so hard just looking at him.  Vic, what's up?  Hey, guys.  You guys, I almost crashed my car.  That is right.  You need to use that.  That's really good.  Huh?  You need to use that as like a thing for you guys.  Yeah, right on, man.  She's such a loser.  Oh.  All right.  I almost killed myself.  She's all right.  All right, Vic.  Thank you.  Take it easy, guys.  We're going to take a quick break here.  Ozzy's calling in today, right?  What, Rick?  I got more retarded Laverne and Shirley stuff from last night, too.  What kind of stuff? 
[01:12:30]  The clips from the bus.  Oh, you're working on the clips from the bus?  I just got a list of them.  Yeah.  We sent the freaks, that's what we're calling them today, back to New York on the bus after  the road show.  They were completely hammered and we were rolling tape, right?  I forgot about this.  When will that be ready?  Give me a few more minutes.  I'm just going to finish up editing one more piece and it's set.  All right.  You're going to love what Lady Di is talking about, Stinky.  All right.  When is Ozzy calling?  Sometime before 6.  All right.  Very good.  God is calling in. 
[01:13:00]  Yeah.  Hell yeah.  Also, we're getting a lot of requests for the Tom Brokaw, the foul-mouth Tom Brokaw  bit we did just before we went to Philly.  Oh, yeah.  We're going to replay that in the 5 o'clock hour.  So, you should roll tape because it's hilarious.  Absolutely hilarious.  Okay?  Cool.  Lots still to do.  Stay there.  I am Dave.  I'm Perry.  Steven.  And we're Jane's Addiction.  This is Jane's Addiction.  You're listening to Opie and Anthony.  You're listening to Opie and Anthony.  Anthony and Opie.  And you are listening.  1027 WNEW.  We are Sports Guys, Blaine and Craig. 
[01:13:30]  Mornings on a mic.  Midday.  Opie and Anthony afternoon.  Ron and fans at night.  We are 1027 WNEW.  And you're checking out the Opie and Anthony show today.  Thanks for listening.  A couple phone numbers in the New York area.  877-692-1027.  Anywhere else.  866-277-4WOW.  More pictures are up on OpieandAnthony.com. 
[01:14:00]  Oh, yeah.  From last night's road show.  That was a huge success.  There are some real gems up there.  The new pictures that are up.  You go to picture what is it?  228 of the newest set.  Oh, my God.  It's Lady Di and Marion.  Marion in the foreground.  With a world of hurt going on in those stretch pants.  Look at that thing. 
[01:14:30]  She's got kids.  The guy actually did something with that area right there.  Smuggle in a bean bag.  Joe, what's going on?  Yo, what's up, O&A?  Oh, you're the bassist from Octane.  Yeah, man.  How's it going?  I've got to give you guys your props, man.  You guys killed last night.  Yeah, good job.  Yo, I've got to say, it was one of the greatest nights of my life.  It was up there with losing my virginity, man.  Oh, cool.  But, you know, I've just got to say my favorite part of the show,  and I don't know if you guys were able to see it or not,  because you weren't out on the platform. 
[01:15:00]  At the end of the bikini contest, right, when Lady Di went out, this one cup of beer got her straight in the effing face.  If anybody gets a picture of that, they should send it to you guys, dude.  It was unreal.  Yeah, we're patiently waiting for the pictures of Lady Di in her bikini.  They're still not up on opiananthony.com.  Oh, my God.  We knew all pictures of people getting smashed in the face with beer.  We'll be adding pictures for the next, I don't know, at least four or five days. 
[01:15:30]  Oh, yeah.  My question about Lady Di is when you lift your shirt, if there are udders, does it count as a wow?  I know.  You see those things?  And Marion flashing, too, last night.  Very rare that she flashes anymore these days.  She was feeling it, though.  She was feeling it because she was hammered.  Hammered.  Hammered.  And she flips her shirt up, and she doesn't have to lift her shirt more than three inches before you see Nip.  I mean, those things are like, you know what it reminds me of?  You ever drive through farmland and see those silos that fell over and they're just laying on the ground? 
[01:16:00]  It looks like two of those on her chest.  It looks pretty horrific.  They're long.  Her boobs are long, not big.  All right, Joe.  Thank you.  Yeah, take care, fellas.  All right, peace.  It's like two big fruit roll-ups hanging off her chest.  Can we get to the audio of the bus?  Yeah.  All right.  A bunch of people asking us about our ratings in Washington.  We stink.  So why don't we talk about the road show more? 
[01:16:30]  We stink in Washington.  Yeah.  We don't play games here.  There's nothing going on yet in Washington for the Opie and Anthony show.  We understood going into Washington that it was going to be tough because they took down a mic off the air, you know,  and put them on before us and really just effed up the market.  So it's going to take time for people to decide if they like us, if, you know.  And they had quite the ratings there in afternoons.  We went to midday.  We were on a ratings roll.  We found out we were number one in New York, number one in Philly, number one in Boston. 
[01:17:00]  Cleveland's ratings went way up.  Yeah.  Not number one there yet, but it's too early to tell.  Working on it.  And Washington, no signs of life yet for us.  How long have you been on in Washington?  I don't know, six or seven weeks.  It's still early.  It's been going on the last week.  It's early, but when you work for a huge company, you know, they're already panicking and freaking.  Freaking out.  Trying to figure out if there's anything good going on for us yet in Washington.  So maybe if they didn't take us off for goddamn Redskins pregame for three hours before the game, maybe that would help out. 
[01:17:30]  We'll get there.  It's going to take time.  We said it from day one.  Yeah.  Because we know they effed up the whole market by bringing us on.  So there's your answer about Washington.  Yeah.  I mean, we brag about when it's good, and we'll tell you when it sucks.  As Bill would say, we're working on it, Popeye.  We are working on it.  Maybe if we stop talking about Philly, Washington would feel like they're part of the family.  No.  We'll get there. 
[01:18:00]  All right.  You want to play some of the audio from the bus ride back?  Where's my list?  Yeah.  Let me hear some of this.  This is the retard of Laverne and Shirley.  Did they tape anyone else on the bus?  A little bit of Patty in one of these, but not really much.  Oh, Deke.  This is mostly stuff from the ride back.  Well, we should get Earl in here, because Earl had a chaperone on the bus back to New York,  and he was so bummed, because everyone else was pretty much either keeping to themselves 
[01:18:30]  or out cold after partying all day.  Yeah.  Except for these two clowns.  They don't stop talking.  They're not human beings.  That's why.  Only human beings would be tired.  So Earl's like, hell, if I'm going to be awake with these two, I might as well tape them.  So he did that for us.  So let's start with Lady Di and Marion talking about yin-yang party?  Yeah.  We should be ourselves.  It's going to be nutty.  That's where we are. 
[01:19:00]  We are nutty.  We're party people.  We're party all the time.  We're nutty.  We're a yin-yang party.  That's our motto.  Yin-yang party.  That's right, Rob.  They're just so proud of themselves.  They are so happy with their yin-yang party.  That's our motto.  Yin-yang party.  That's our motto.  That's our motto.  Like, they live that every day.  Who are they saying that to?  Were you interviewing them, Earl?  They were saying it to Mary.  They were saying it to the bus driver, because she was like, where are you guys going?  Oh, my God.  The bus driver asked them a question. 
[01:19:30]  Is this the way there or home?  That was on the way over.  That was on the way to the party.  You got the drunken conversation stuff, right?  Yeah, that's afterwards.  That is priceless.  So they kept you awake all for the ride home?  Oh, I got to interrupt.  Look at that.  Okay, where was this one?  That is no joke.  That's not me.  Drunk?  I am being choked out by Lady Di, because she's completely hammered.  Is that on opiananthony.com?  It will be.  It will be.  F and moron took so many really good pictures. 
[01:20:00]  Thanks a lot, dude.  You did a great job.  And no joke, I got to stress, I am being choked out.  She was so happy.  She had a great time.  She was leaving.  She goes, I just need a hug.  And she was choking me out.  Look at her latching on like she's ready to suck your blood.  All 300 pounds is leaning forward on my body.  That is the fattest tick I've ever seen.  I'm holding her up by my neck.  There's only one other time you could possibly make that face.  Got a uterus as a divining rod on opiananthony.com. 
[01:20:30]  What is that, Bill?  All right, so that'll be up on opiananthony.com in a matter of moments.  You're just, you're like, ah.  That's not a face because I'm disgusted.  That's a face.  I know, yeah, I know.  I'm like, oh my God, I can't breathe.  She is choking.  And she's smothering me.  Look at that jacket and the bag.  The whole package is disgusting. 
[01:21:00]  That's pretty heavy duty.  How'd you get her off of you?  Did you need somebody to burn her with a cigarette so the head didn't stay under the skin?  Pulling out with tweezers close to the neck.  She does it like a big fat tick.  She's engorged.  Six little legs wiggling.  We got to interrupt the festivities because the legend is on the phone.  Ozzy Osbourne.  Ozzy!  How you doing?  What's going on, bro?  I'm just, I'm just, I'm traveling to Manhattan right now. 
[01:21:30]  Oh, you are?  I'm going to get a helicopter to an in-store tonight.  Yeah, sounds like you were at our road show last night.  Yeah, we were doing another one tonight.  Yeah, we had a huge party last night, Ozzy, in Philly, and we're completely hungover.  You can relate to that, right?  Absolutely.  Right on, man.  Of course.  So, where are you, in a limo in Manhattan?  I'm in a van going to the airport to get a helicopter to take me through. 
[01:22:00]  Where's the in-store tonight on?  Where is it?  I think he's...  I don't know, I'm going to go to an in-store appearance.  Then I'm going to fly from there to Philadelphia to see you guys tomorrow.  Well, no, we're in New York.  Are you in New York?  Yeah, but we're syndicated all over the place, and I think I figured this out.  You're in Manhattan, they're getting you to a helicopter, and they're going to put you  on a helicopter so you do a CD signing on Long Island, right?  Something like that. 
[01:22:30]  You're on the right path.  Hey, Ozzy, I've got to tell you, I heard the new CD.  It's phenomenal.  Thank you very much.  Your voice has held up extremely well all these years.  It's really...  I mean, Tim Palmer, the producer, did a really good job with me, and I'll be happy with the  end result, you know?  It seems like this is like a really personal CD.  There's a lot of stuff about the way you're feeling it, man.  It's really terrific.  Did you do it on purpose?  It didn't start out to me...  It's turned out to be somewhat of one of my most personal albums to date. 
[01:23:00]  And I didn't intend to do that, because that's the way it kind of came about, you know?  Yeah.  You have a nice ballad, it seems like, to your kids.  Dream is a dreamer you're talking about.  Yeah.  You know, the real...  That song, I never get tired of hearing it.  I think it's one of the best things I've ever had anything to do with.  It's really good.  The album's a really good album, I think.  Yeah, without a doubt.  Gets Me Through is a song off the album that you wrote for the fans there, Ozzy. 
[01:23:30]  Pardon?  Gets Me Through.  Yeah.  You wrote that one for your fans, man.  Well, yeah, but I don't really like discussing who or what I wrote it for.  Right.  I mean, some people might think it's something completely different, but the truth of the  matter is I really did write it for the fans, because my fans have been the greatest love  affair I've ever had in my life.  I mean, I really genuinely do love the guys, people out there. 
[01:24:00]  Right on.  Hey, we've got Jim Norton in the studio.  He helps us out with the radio show, Ozzy.  He is a huge fan of yours, a huge Black Sabbath fan.  I met you, actually, at MTV years ago.  It's funny.  I beg your pardon?  I met you at MTV.  Can you speak up?  I can't hear you.  I met you a few years ago at MTV.  You met me?  At MTV.  At MTV.  When was that?  Oh, years ago.  Oh, yeah.  I made you uncomfortable.  I was staring at you like John Hinckley looking at Jodie Foster. 
[01:24:30]  You were really uncomfortable by me.  Oh?  You may be uncomfortable.  I didn't mean to.  I was just staring at you, licking my lips nervously.  Yeah, he's such a big fan, Ozzy, that he was staring uncontrollably at you.  Oh, well.  Hey, did you fire Joe Holmes because you wanted Zach back?  No, no, no, no, no.  I didn't invite Joe.  I mean, I don't, I don't, I don't, my fans are saying, Joe's great, Zach's great, Ozzy's  great, but Zach and Ozzy together are the greats. 
[01:25:00]  And so I kind of lent towards what the fans wanted to see, really.  And Joe's got about three or four of his songs on the album, you know, which I wrote with Joe.  You seem to have a couple of ballads on this album, too.  It seems like...  Yeah, kind of.  There's like one ballad and there was one kind of middle of the road kind of song.  Junkie's a great song, too.  Hello?  Yeah, Junkie, great song.  Ozzy!  Yes? 
[01:25:30]  Are you still dry or have you, do you partake in any drink or anything?  Semi-dry.  Semi-dry.  What's your poison of choice?  Oh, the occasional glass of wine, then I don't, and that's about it, you know?  That's it, huh?  Then my wife goes, no more.  Yeah.  Now, the wife's the lord, the lord and master of my domain.  She goes, you've had enough, that's enough.  When's she going to get her sainthood? 
[01:26:00]  Pardon?  When is she going to get her sainthood?  Her sainthood for dealing with you for so long.  I don't know, she deserves one, didn't she?  Yeah.  Hey, Ozzy, your daughters are getting older.  What would you do if your daughter brought home a kid as a boyfriend and he was like a 17-year-old Ozzy Osbourne?  That's a difficult question for me to answer because I think I'd be worried about my kids, you know?  Right.  I was a very humble kind of a teenager. 
[01:26:30]  I was crazy.  How do you teach your kids, now that you're a little older and wiser, how do you teach them to stay away from some of the same stuff that you...  Well, they've seen me come home in different stages, so I think I'll put them off, you know?  I mean, all kids are going to experiment with, like, parts and alcohol and things, but, you know, my wife's really on top of the case.  She, she, she, she's incredible with it, you know? 
[01:27:00]  My wife's, um, she, she, she does deserve a sign of her because she runs my business, she runs the house, she renovates my house, she's renovated my house.  She finds time for every one of the kids and all the dogs and cats we have, you know?  Right.  Well, God bless her.  I've been meaning to ask you this for years.  Do you have any tattoos on your penis?  Uh, no.  All right.  That's all he wanted to know.  I had to know that, Oz.  All right, Ozzy, they're telling... 
[01:27:30]  We're telling...  All right.  Very nice.  Well, we've got to let you go.  They're telling...  All right, take care.  Nice talking to you guys.  Yeah, they're telling us we've got to get you on a helicopter.  So, the in-store's tonight?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Long Island.  Looney Tunes in Babylon tonight at 7.  And Ozzy's signing brand new copies of his latest CD, Down to Earth, right?  And Ozzy...  Yeah.  Ozzy, you're the coolest human being on the face of the earth.  All right.  God bless you, man.  All right, Ozzy.  Bye-bye.  Bye, Ozzy.  That was a nice surprise, right? 
[01:28:00]  Wow!  Nice.  That was cool!  I feel good about my own hearing loss at this point, man.  You know...  Hey, hey, what?  Hey, some time they go...  Take advantage of the helicopter.  It's not a good thing to see anybody.  What?  Hello?  Hello?  You're listening to the Rush Limbaugh show?  No, no, no.  I can't hear a bloody thing. 
[01:28:30]  Hello!  You know, the funniest thing is Pete Johnson, the engineer, was out there freaking out.  He's like, what's wrong?  I can't hear you through the thing?  What's wrong with the phone system?  He's out there in a panic.  I'm like, dude, it's Ozzy.  He's fried.  I'll rewire his brain.  He's got a cell phone moving, so, you know, I don't think the legend can't hear.  He heard the first part of the calls very well, but then it seems like they moved into a different zone,  and he lost some of the connection.  That's what it is.  With hearing unknown from God, it's all yours bones. 
[01:29:00]  What?  That's Rush Limbaugh.  Rush to where?  No.  That's why I'm taking a helicopter.  Aaron, what's going on?  Yeah, I got a suggestion.  Next time Ozzy calls, maybe instead of speaking, he should just sing everything he wants to say,  so we can understand what he's trying to get out.  Yeah, you can understand every word Ozzy says when he's singing, but then he talks.  We love our time with Ozzy.  And one more thing. 
[01:29:30]  I've never seen Norton more humble when he's speaking to anyone than he's speaking to Ozzy.  You don't understand how huge a fan Norton is.  Norton doesn't ask for much from us, and he begged us.  He goes, dude, you don't understand Ozzy's like God in my eyes.  I need to talk to him.  Yeah, I had to.  I mean, most interviews, I'll ask one question just to do it, but with Ozzy, I had to ask him.  I had to.  All right.  Thank you, Aaron.  Later, guys.  Bye.  My new album, it's called Shout at Ozzy, because I can't hear you. 
[01:30:00]  Lenny, what's up?  Hey, that was a great impression of John Madden.  John Madden?  Yeah.  That guy was fried.  How do you count?  Like Norton said, I think he's on a cell phone, he's in a limo, he's racing to get to a helicopter, you know.  Unreal.  Anyway, you guys rock.  Keep up the good work, man.  All right.  Thank you, bro.  Ciao.  Bye.  Now I'm thinking of questions I should have asked him, I suck.  We knew we only had a few minutes with him, because somebody's suggesting Ozzy should do books on tape. 
[01:30:30]  Keith, what's going on?  Hey, who's his opening act?  Jimmy Superfly Snooker?  Hello, this is Jimmy Superfly Snooker.  All right.  Okay, brother.  Okay, brother.  Okay, brother.  Rich, you're next on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Hey, boys, what's happening?  Hey, boys.  Listen, you guys, I hope you really replayed this, because all I got was hello, helicopter, and daughter.  You can never understand what Ozzy says, but the man's a legend and he's got great music. 
[01:31:00]  We love, we love Ozzy.  He talks like that for real, though.  Yeah, he's great.  His kids are more smarter than he is.  I love my children.  I want to get back to another helicopter.  The only word I understood is helicopter.  That wasn't fake.  No, no, no.  That was not fake.  You've got to understand something.  That was Ozzy Osbourne. 
[01:31:30]  Wait, Ben, what are they saying on the instant feedback?  They're like, oh, you guys have to make that a regular bit.  No, that was Ozzy.  That's funny.  We swear to you, that was Ozzy.  Dude, I called Florentine at home.  I'm like, oh, what should I ask him?  Believe me, it was really Ozzy.  No, Ben set up the whole thing through the record.  That was Ozzy.  That was Ozzy Osbourne.  Earl did.  I mean, Earl did.  I'm sorry.  Yeah, I mean, we joke about Earl being useless, but he definitely gets us in good interviews.  He does.  I mean, we'll give you the props, Earl.  That was Ozzy, right?  Yes. 
[01:32:00]  Of course it was.  God, that was so great.  Semi-dry.  Semi-dry.  So, you know, an occasional barrel of wine.  That's what I'm doing now.  Well, I'm on the helicopter.  Helicopter.  How funny was that like?  I'm going to get a long eye on a whirlybird.  Box of wine, I won't go home.  Be right, smack and left.  Mike, what's going on? 
[01:32:30]  What's going on, O&A?  What's up, man?  Nothing.  I was just ready for Ozzy to do a little doggie.  Over and out, precious.  All right.  Hey, Helicopter.  God, it was just a quick five-minute little interview and the people are losing it.  Rob, what's up?  Hey, how you guys doing?  Trying to get past this.  Hey, Rob.  Hey, you guys can't kid me.  That was Andy doing his Arthur invitation, wasn't it? 
[01:33:00]  You must have hated it, Moose.  Don't you hate Perry's wife?  Heartlander, get in the helicopter.  People still, still, after we've said that, still think that that was fake.  They're saying it was that other guy, Ozzy, that's called in.  No, no, no.  You guys are good Ozzy, but believe...  I believe that's an audience.  No, we do have a guy that calls in and does a dead-on Ozzy, but I'm telling you, we set  this up through the record company.  He's taking his life out of the cheese. 
[01:33:30]  You think he wants some cheese?  In the helicopter?  John, what's up?  Hey, I think Norton just made him uncomfortable by telling him his uncomfortable story.  Yeah, that was a double uncomfortable with Ozzy there.  Okay, what a conversation would be between him and the Beverly Hills Billy guy.  Yeah, it would be interesting.  I just had to tell him that, dude, because I was staring at him and he walked in where  I couldn't look at him anymore.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, wow. 
[01:34:00]  It's great, man.  Greatest human alive.  That was memorable.  Come on, everybody.  A quick five-minute Ozzy interview is now memorable.  Steve, what's up?  What's up?  I have to call.  I've got to tell you guys, Ozzy had an in-store last night.  The guy was so unbelievably fried.  It was just hilarious.  Well, he's going to be at Looney Tunes in Babylon tonight at seven on Long Island.  Just look for the helicopter in the sky and you know he's on as well.  There you go, Looney Tunes. 
[01:34:30]  There's a gold and a half of it.  You just look up in the sky.  It's a bird.  It's a plane.  It's a helicopter.  With Ozzy Osbourne inside of it.  Bop.  Now it's mine.  No, it's not.  All right.  J-Mo is a Jew.  Oh, a heap.  Should I have had Ozzy say carpet muncher? 
[01:35:00]  Carpet muncher.  Carpet muncher.  That's great, man.  I can't wait for the Ozzy in Perry Corner on MTV.  People love the Ozzy there.  A lot of people are saying Ozzy's starting to sound like Buddy Epson.  All right.  People think because he stutters a little.  He's been doing that for 30 years.  I mean, that's not new.  You can get up on that stage and he kicks ass still.  Greatest.  Yeah, and the city's getting rave reviews, the latest one. 
[01:35:30]  The video's unbelievable, too.  Steve showed me the video.  I forget what it's called, but actually, it's very good.  All right.  Well, thank you very much.  I love the TV.  Don't forget to buy it for the cockroaches decon foregone.  Spray it in your helicopter.  All right.  We're going to take a break.  We can do an hour on this.  The phones are lit.  Okay.  On the way, right after the break, we got some hidden audio from the bus trip back to New York 
[01:36:00]  from Philly with the retard of Laverne Shirley.  Some really funny stuff on the way with that.  And a bit that people have been requesting for the last two or three days.  No joke.  Foul mouth Tom Brokaw.  Ah.  Getting really pissed off about the whole anthrax thing.  The audio you did not hear on NBC.  Nightly news because Brokaw lost it.  Yes.  But people want this on tape, so get your tape players ready, okay?  Welcome to the bottomless kick of ignorance. 
[01:36:30]  Opie.  I feel like being an idiot.  Anthony.  I'm a retard.  The Opie and Anthony show.  That thing's hilarious.  Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.  This is the Opie and Anthony show.  Yo.  Yo.  Crystal meth, the name of the game.  I think we're going to be hanging with those guys in Boston in about a week, week and a  half.  Ah, yeah.  Boston, we're coming, man.  A week from Monday.  Feeling the love in Boston, so we're heading that way next. 
[01:37:00]  And then we've got to work on Washington.  Washington hates us.  We stink.  Joe, what's going on?  What's up, guys?  Hey.  I just wanted to say that whole Ozzy thing, that was the funniest piece of radio I've ever  heard in my life.  Ever?  You liked Ozzy?  You know how you guys want to, like, help out the whole New York relief fund and everything?  Yeah.  I have the perfect idea for you guys.  You guys should put out a Christmas album.  Yeah.  Just get, like, the Ozzy impersonator, Neil Diamond, get the John Madden guy. 
[01:37:30]  Dude, that was Ozzy.  Cotted, Laverne, and Shirley, all of them to sing, like, Christmas hits.  You think that was an impersonator?  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  I'm just trying to say if you can't get Ozzy, get the impersonator that you guys are doing  afterwards.  We were talking about putting out another CD the other day, you know?  We have enough material for, God, about 10 CDs at this point, and it's about time we  get another one out there on the market.  Yeah, definitely.  I just wanted to say you guys rock.  All right, Joe, thank you.  Wait a minute.  Did they dump out of Ozzy? 
[01:38:00]  They dumped out?  What do you mean?  Did they?  Yeah, of course.  Hilarious line he had they dumped out of.  What line?  Let's just say, reword it.  The inch one?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  What a baby.  If you ask a guy, let's just say you say to a guy, do you have a tattoo on junk?  Right.  And they say, no, but I wish I had another nine inches tattooed on.  It was hilarious.  Yeah.  Why are they dumping out of that?  I don't know.  That doesn't make any sense.  Why?  You're allowed to talk about your junk.  You'd never see a complaint from something like that. 
[01:38:30]  No.  It's just ridiculous what they dump out of now.  It is so ridiculous.  Oh, you can't say that.  Too bad.  You missed a great line.  Oh, and your gum line from yesterday got dumped out of.  What was the gum line?  Probably the funniest thing you've ever said.  Of course it did.  Ever said on our radio show.  Of course it did.  And no one heard it.  Of course.  It was panics with the dump button.  Can he stop?  He shakes worse than Ozzy when he's on that dump button.  Worst.  What?  Nothing, Ozzy.  You're in a helicopter now.  I don't know what I'm saying. 
[01:39:00]  It's about to get into anything.  I don't know.  It's about to call me.  It's in my helicopter.  All right.  Let's get to the audio of Lady Diane Marion.  And by the way, more pictures up on opieandanthony.com.  There's a few pictures of the girls wowing the Philly crowd.  Oh, yeah.  The retarded Laverne Shirley wowing the Philly crowd.  Okay.  So, yeah. 
[01:39:30]  After the road show in Philly last night, a lot of the freaks went back in the bus, completely hammered.  All they wanted to do was sleep.  But Lady Diane Marion, I swear to God, these two do not shut up.  No.  So, Earl decided to tape him on the way home to New York.  And now the next clip will be Lady Di talking about dancing at the road show, I'm assuming.  Dancing and the bikini contest.  And the bikini contest.  Okay, yeah.  Lady Di, we talked into going on the stage for the bikini contest. 
[01:40:00]  Yeah.  And all her, what?  Can you talk about dancing or will they dump out of that?  Because that could be misconstrued as sexual, somehow moving your hips.  All right, here's Lady Di talking about the road show, dancing and the bikini contest.  You're dancing pretty crazy out on that stage, like naked.  Oh, yeah.  But it was a good tie, right?  I wasn't naked, I wasn't naked, was I?  Semi.  Nah, nah. 
[01:40:30]  Semi-gable, sir.  What do you mean semi?  You got more confidence than me, girl.  Let me tell you, I couldn't have gotten up there.  Oh, my God.  I would have been nervous beyond belief.  Get out of here.  I just would have been scared.  I don't have that kind of confidence.  So one of the other ones I showed my boobies and that was it.  Nothing else, right?  You don't remember?  I remember that.  I'm so sorry.  I remember that.  Yeah, well, you did a cute little bottom of it.  Earl, shut up, Earl. 
[01:41:00]  I'm black.  Over here.  Earl.  That's all I showed you.  I showed was that.  Something else.  Maybe a little bit of my ass, but that was it.  Oh, my God.  There's no such thing as a little bit of your ass.  She has no clue what she did on the stage.  No.  No.  Oh, wow.  Oh, just imagine that.  I couldn't take that clip.  Imagine being on that bus.  Like, I couldn't even take the clip. 
[01:41:30]  I was getting claustrophobic.  Yeah, but you know something?  She was kind of mellow, and you didn't hear Marion once.  What happened to Marion?  Did someone knock her out?  She was just sitting there.  She was hammered.  Yeah.  All right, here's Lady Di talking about her drinking.  You kept up with us?  It's fine.  No problem.  How many do you think you had tonight?  Do you remember?  About 10.  10.  10, really?  10 or 12, maybe?  How many do you have?  I've been there in about three.  She has about three.  She's got a drink for three Luminates and about three beers. 
[01:42:00]  Wow.  So that's a big deal for you, then.  Well, I can put two.  But you know, me, I can handle my beer, so I'm fine.  Yeah?  I'm fine.  Yeah, I'm fine.  I'm fine.  She gets so adamant about things.  I can handle my beer.  I'm fine.  I'm fine.  She was wrecked.  Wrecked.  Completely hammered.  And you don't hear Marion because she's riding up on the dashboard with her head bobbing  up and down under the rearview mirror.  Hey, man, I'm a little troll. 
[01:42:30]  Who was doing the interviewing?  Mary.  Mary.  Mary was feeding them questions.  Mary did a good job.  I was sitting in the corner just crying.  I was laughing so hard.  I'm fine.  I'm fine.  John Ross, you know, we're crying.  I'm fine.  The next clip is Lady Di talking about Stinky and she might like Stinky.  She loves Stinky.  Uh-oh.  Where's Stinky?  He'll come running in in a sec.  I hear this.  Go ahead.  Stinky.  What did you mean?  All right, Stinky, put the headphones on so you can hear what Lady Di said about it.  What did you think that you thought was the best? 
[01:43:00]  He's a lynch.  Did you think he was attractive?  Yes.  Yes, I did.  Yeah?  Well, I did.  I thought he was very attractive.  But I thought your favorite was Stinky, right?  Stinky.  You're like Stinky.  You thought Stinky was really attractive, right?  I think Stinky is adorable.  Yeah, you think he's adorable?  I think he's adorable.  I think Stinky is very, very...  Oh, you tried to work it if you could, huh?  I think you should be like...  Yeah.  I think Stinky's cute. 
[01:43:30]  You know what that tape is missing?  Screeching of tires on asphalt and another tractor trailer hitting them.  That's the only sound that I think is missing on that tape that I would like to hear.  Oh, man.  She thinks you're cute, Stinky.  Yeah, great.  So you got that going for you.  Which is nice.  Which is nice.  And he's right.  He's a strapping young lad.  Garrett has kind of sealed out.  What's the Marion Bobbitt clip?  She talks about cutting a guy's thing. 
[01:44:00]  She wants to cut a guy's thing?  She threatened a guy or something.  All right.  She threatened a guy, I guess.  Here we go.  Did you get frightened when you saw the Aphrodite?  No, not really.  Was the Aphrodite?  No, it's not.  The Aphrodite, right?  Aphrodite.  No, I did not have to fight if I see it in the Aphrodite.  But it was funny seeing her dance in front of me, him or her.  What about the point where you went to when we saw the Swann Raff? 
[01:44:30]  The Swann Raff movie?  That was the funniest thing.  Yeah, that was the way you pulled the knife on the guy.  The only thing.  I did.  I told the knife on the guy trying to cut his roll.  Oh, my God.  Did you really?  Why don't you tell us?  You say it.  I want to hear you.  He's in a little great closet.  Did she threaten you?  That's right.  Patty.  I'm going to tell you.  She almost did a little bit of bobbet on him.  We got stuck in Manhattan.  And we had a, like, you know, like, wait, like, two hours for a train.  And we went to this point. 
[01:45:00]  We went to a video play.  Play pinball.  We were about, like, 19 or 18.  And we went to the porn theater and watched a porn movie.  There was a guy trying to pick me and her up.  And I told her.  I used to carry a pocket knife to me.  I did.  And then I told the guy, I said, if you come near me and try to pick me up, I swear to God,  I will slice your f*** off.  He ran out of the porn theater so fast, I couldn't believe it.  Oh, my God.  Wait.  They had a two-hour delay.  So they went to a porn theater to first play pinball. 
[01:45:30]  Right.  And then decided to check out a porno.  And a guy is trying.  How desperate is that guy trying to pick up those two in a porn theater?  Yeah.  That comes right after you lick the floor for a few minutes.  You know, it's funny.  She was threatening to cut his junk off.  But as he got closer and realized who he was trying to pick up, he did it himself.  She was so ashamed.  I mean, can you imagine what a buzzkill that would be to be in a porno movie and see those  two farm animals babbling?  I said, I'll cut your junk off. 
[01:46:00]  Ying, yang, yang, rape.  I need the rest of that story now, though, man.  So when I was in a porno movie, and I was manipulating Lady Di, and I saw the pecs back.  Ugh.  Pity she couldn't have fallen on it when it was open.  Just big margarita.  What's that?  Jimmy Buffett sweatshirt.  Ying, yang, porno. 
[01:46:30]  Ying, yang, porno.  All right.  The next clip is Marion saying that she's not drunk.  You know, the funny part of the story is the man was Ozzy Osbourne.  She said, so I ran for the helicopter.  Ozzy.  Thank you, Ozzy.  All right.  Marion isn't drunk.  She's trying to tell everybody.  Mike, that's a good one, I'm like.  You did a good job tonight, Rosszy.  Hey, we're all in defense tonight. 
[01:47:00]  I'm in the middle of honor.  Oh, you did a good job tonight.  Thank you, man.  What did you, Mike?  Mike.  That's Mike.  Thank you.  Mike.  Good big job.  That's a drink.  I remember his name.  I remember his name.  Let's go back.  Mike.  Mike.  I remember his name.  His name is Mike.  Mike.  Thank you so much.  Anytime.  All right.  There was nothing there.  Yeah, there was really nothing there.  That one sucked.  Mary, who was talking to the girls on the bus ride home to New York last night.  Mary, what's up?  Hey, what's going on? 
[01:47:30]  How are you feeling today?  I'm in a lot of pain today.  Yeah.  But I had a good time yesterday.  And you were interviewing the freaks?  What you guys don't even realize is that she was talking on and on about how, oh, I can handle my liquor.  And that's when I started asking her about when she was on stage.  And then she was like, oh, I don't remember.  Yeah, she doesn't remember.  Yeah.  Patty wasn't really too into the conversation, though.  She was just kind of watching.  She was kind of scared of him.  She was covered in tinkle. 
[01:48:00]  All right.  Well, thank you, Mary, for helping us out with that.  Well, I'd like you now.  Have a good day.  All right.  Daniel checking in.  I guess syndication underground from Alabama says, I just learned Voss almost had his junk  cut off at a point of a theater.  Voss.  Now Marion is trying to say that a lady died, drank too much.  Listen, Mary.  What's up with you?  You're drinking too much.  Look at this, Marion.  Marion. 
[01:48:30]  Oh, okay.  Drank a little bit.  I'm sorry.  See you again.  See you again.  See you again.  Rick, you must have supersonic ears if you think this is good stuff.  Yeah, I couldn't really hear that.  I couldn't hear that.  Yeah, you drank too much.  Oh, I'm sorry.  And then she goes, a yin-yang party.  Like she had to say that a yin-yang party.  You know, it doesn't matter if I drink too much.  It's a yin-yang party.  I didn't hear any of that.  I just heard white noise. 
[01:49:00]  Yeah.  Two kvetching sea cows.  Oh, God.  Does it get better from here?  Sure.  Okay.  Oh, sure.  Lady died talking about gay porno.  Oh, my God. 
[01:49:30]  Lady died.  I liked watching men F.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Well, here she is on the line here.  Lady died.  Yeah, hi.  How you doing?  All right.  How are you?  Oh, God.  Our catchphrase.  They got catchphrases now.  You guys are something else.  I didn't realize you were recording the stuff that we said on the bus.  Lady died. 
[01:50:00]  What is going on with the gay?  You like watching men?  No, it was just a one-time thing.  I was just curious.  That's all.  And, you know, I watched it, and that was it.  Did you like watching men?  That was years ago.  Wait a minute.  Did you like watching men have sex with each other, or did you ask one to sleep with you,  and he said, I'd rather do this?  No.  No, Norton.  It was not like that at all.  It was a movie.  I just wanted to watch one of those movies one time in New York, and that was all.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Where did you go to see gay porno?  It was in New York. 
[01:50:30]  It was years ago.  And you purposely went to search out?  Before Norton turned into Disneyland.  You purposely searched out gay porno because you had an interest?  It was basically in a lot of places.  Well, why didn't you go for the straight sex video?  Oh, boy, huh?  Why didn't you go for the straight sex video?  I did that, too.  You know, remember what it was like.  I did that, too.  But you said on the tape last night that you kind of liked checking that out.  No, I was curious about that.  When you left the theater that night, did your fingers smell like antipasto?  Um, no. 
[01:51:00]  No.  Oh, that voice.  I wish I had Ozzy's hearing right now.  We had a great time at the road show, guys.  That's what I wanted to say.  What?  We had a great time at the road show.  Well, hey.  No.  No, we had a great time at the road show.  If you were coming with me, I couldn't get up too happy.  Marion, Marion, you had a great time yesterday.  You guys had a good time, right?  Yes, we did.  We all had a good time.  Okay.  All right.  I liked you and your bikini.  And we love you guys.  And, you know, Opie, I'm sorry if I hugged you too hard. 
[01:51:30]  Well, check out the picture on opieandanthony.com.  Oh, my God.  I'm so sorry if I hugged you guys too much.  Ying-yang killed yourself.  What?  Talk to you later, guys.  Wait, wait, wait.  Wait.  You looked actually pretty nice in your bikini.  Well, thank you very much.  Who was that, Norton?  Yes.  All right.  Thank you, Norton.  Your dumper didn't look as absolutely horrendous as I expected it to.  Norton, be nice, will you?  I am. 
[01:52:00]  I'm telling you.  Dustin Pierre.  Lady Di, there's a whole lot of hurt going on in your panties, man.  Well, you know.  She got that square ass.  I'm in my 30s, though.  It's a square ass.  I hate when the ladies use that as an excuse.  I'm in my 30s.  We'll line up a bunch of girls in their 30s and 40s that, you know, keep themselves together.  Oh, okay.  That means I have to work out a little more often.  That's all.  That's what it means.  Yeah, just a little bit.  Yeah.  How about one?  How about one sit-up?  Well, I'll work out a little more.  What's your routine now, Lady Di?  My routine right now is walking, basically. 
[01:52:30]  What, to the fridge?  No, not to the fridge.  Walking around.  And just doing little things here and there.  I've got to do more stuff.  How about some bigger things?  Walking around my own perimeter.  So you walk around.  I have to jog.  That's what I have to start doing.  The race is like a 500-page atlas opened up to page 250.  I mean, I don't know what else to tell you.  I have to get back out there and jog again.  Lady Di.  How about you start with walking around the block? 
[01:53:00]  Yeah.  Walking around the block is good, too.  What did you eat today?  What did I eat today?  Yeah.  I had a sandwich before.  Yeah, what kind of sandwich?  Fat-free ham and cheese.  It was a seven-foot hero.  Fat-free ham and a Chevy.  I'm telling you the truth.  With low-fat mayonnaise.  I'd wash it down when it died.  Low-fat mayonnaise.  You know, you can see it with the low-fat stuff,  and then the box of Entenmann's goes through like a wood chipper.  Oh, well, that's what I had today. 
[01:53:30]  Plus, I woke up late because I got home this morning, so.  Guys, we had a great time yesterday.  All right, Lady Di.  Okay.  You take care.  See you next time.  Oh, wait.  What?  Oh, wait.  No, no.  I just want to...  Do these clips get better?  We got two more left, right?  More on the gay porn theater from Lady Di.  All right.  We got two more real fast.  And then we got to get to the foul-mouthed Tom Brokaw bit from the other day 
[01:54:00]  that a lot of people are requesting.  We will do it before this hour is up.  I promise.  All right, go ahead.  Gay porno again here.  Gay porno.  Oh, ran around.  But didn't you say you saw, like, live shows and stuff?  Yes, I did.  I did the wrong one, sorry.  Ah, good job, bro.  All right, here we go.  No, that was me.  That was the other day.  That was you.  You see the wilder of the Laverne and Shirley.  Sort of, but, you know, kind of, sort of, but, you know, she's the more talkative type,  and I'm not...  I'm the more talkative type.  I mean, you know, I don't hear that.  You always got to look out for the fire ones. 
[01:54:30]  The quiet ones are more like the ones that...  I don't want to do it at the point here.  I just don't want to go on here.  Yeah.  That's it.  Ugh.  This bitch stinks.  Yeah.  You can't hear them.  You can't hear them, really.  They're parts of conversation that...  Beck dude from Virginia checking in here.  Men effing.  Never funny.  Never, ever funny.  Never, ever funny. 
[01:55:00]  That's what he wrote.  Never funny.  Never, never, ever funny.  All you hear is her just, like, her stupid, uh, oh, what's the word?  I forgot it.  What's her...  Her tongue reminds me of a big hunk of liverwurst.  Just clumsily trying to speak.  Awful, awful.  Eric, what's going on?  Well, what's up, boys?  Listen, I got a couple of yin-yang tattoos on my body.  After hearing these, fat pieces of, oh, trash, I'm going to get them lasered off.  Right, okay.  I hate these bitches.  All right, thank you.  All right, we're going to regroup. 
[01:55:30]  Yes.  The foul-mouthed Tom Brokaw thing from the other day is next.  It's really, really funny.  A lot of people are requesting it, and we'll get right into it after we take a quick break.  Pull your pants down.  Can I see your taint whipped cream lesbian?  Let me see your butt.  Let me tell you about my balloon nut.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Radio's own slaggy.  This is The Opie and Anthony Show.  If you're in the New York area, a couple phone lines available, 877-692-1027. 
[01:56:00]  Making up for yesterday, we didn't take one phone call during our Philly radio show.  Everyone checking in from the road show.  We haven't talked to Stephen Lynch yet.  He's on the line here.  Lynch, hey!  Morning, guys.  Yeah, I knew that was going to happen.  Hey, how'd I do last night?  Very good.  I don't remember.  Lynch, I felt bad for you, man.  Some guy was sweeping the floor behind me.  I know, that's...  I can say in all my shows, in all my years, I've never had a guy sweeping a floor behind me during the show. 
[01:56:30]  That's a tough room, man.  You're doing your songs that everyone knows and loves, and they usually kill.  There's a guy mopping up behind you.  And then Hot Liz, she's so hammered, she decides she has to show her naked body to everybody.  So in the middle of, I think, Kill a Kitten, she walks out and starts strutting her stuff.  How about between songs?  Between songs.  Yeah, that would have been nice, right?  That would have been all right.  I never saw you drop your guitar. 
[01:57:00]  You're like, all right, well...  I'll wait for her to be done, and then I'll try to, you know, pick up where I left off.  Well, look, man, I've done enough roadshows with you guys to know that when breasts are in the air, there's no point in continuing.  Right.  You just wait until it, you know, runs its course, and then you begin again.  Wait until...  It's like a tornado.  You just head for the root cellar, and then wait till later.  Come out when it's safe.  And, Lynch, you didn't get hit by any beer, right?  No, I didn't get any beer.  Oh, yeah.  Me, thank God.  Or if they did, I, you know...  Notice it. 
[01:57:30]  You didn't notice it, right?  No.  Oh, oh.  Video may show otherwise.  I'm just looking at some new batch of pictures put up.  On opieandanthony.com.  Right.  And as I look at picture eight and nine of the new pictures, it's Lady Di lifting up her shirt.  She has a small bikini bottom on.  And that bunt is just hanging over the bikini bottom.  That is a tire.  That's an inner tube tire. 
[01:58:00]  Looks like she's going swimming.  Oh, my God.  I have to ride in that.  All right.  That's filthy.  Lynch, when did you come home, man?  We came home last night.  Oh, wow.  You did?  Right after the strip club.  Wow.  Yeah.  We got home pretty late.  Yeah.  But I slept all day, so...  And I added a 10.30 show tonight at Gotham, if anybody wants to show up.  Right on.  Oh, a plug.  You'll get to see Stephen Lynch uninterrupted.  Yeah.  Well, no.  Actually, I hired a guy to mop the floor behind me during the show. 
[01:58:30]  Cool, bro.  All right, man.  All right.  Well, thanks, bro, for helping us out once again.  My pleasure.  Next time, we'll put you on earlier so you could, you know, have fun with it.  No, I'd say you can put me on any time you want.  Just inform the cleaning crew that their detail starts after I'm done.  That's got to help your self-esteem.  You're trying to perform, and they're mopping behind you.  Yeah.  All right, Lynch.  All right, I'll catch you guys later. 
[01:59:00]  And there's a picture.  This is what's great about our radio show.  We talk about stuff, and if you think we're full of ass, you go to the website, and there's  a picture of Lynch trying to sing.  You're in mid-verse, and there's Hot Liz completely hammered.  She's in the middle of the runway just showing you her boobs.  This is a professional comedian trying to do his thing on that stage.  Well, that I didn't mind so much.  It was just the clown sweeping the shadow behind me that annoyed me.  I think this is what makes our road show so great. 
[01:59:30]  You just don't know, man, what's going to happen.  Exactly.  All right, that picture will be up soon.  Someone just sent that to us.  Wow, what are we looking at?  Somebody just locked up the dance computer.  Someone sent me a link.  He goes, click on this.  I click on it.  This comes up, and I can't shut it off.  It says, hi, everybody.  I'm looking at gay porno.  And there's all kinds of pictures of gay porn on there.  It's taking up my whole monitor, and I can't get it off. 
[02:00:00]  Hold on a second.  It's like the Chase Manhattan logo.  Found Mount Tom Broko.  Just seconds away.  We're just trying to get through.  Steve, let's just call it here.  Psycho Tim, what's up?  What's up, guys?  Hey.  First of all, I'm effing miserable.  I just got back to Boston after driving all day long.  That's right.  Psycho Tim, our general from Boston, made it all the way to Philly.  Yes.  And I'm hearing a few people from Virginia drove up to Philly, so that's pretty cool.  What do you have to add, Tim? 
[02:00:30]  Well, I was just saying that my brother was a little upset about his chick taking her top off  and running down the, what do you call it, the stage there.  Oh, yeah?  But I instructed him, obviously, that he hadn't met her at a church bake sale.  Well, you know, yeah, well, yeah.  I mean, that's how we met Hot Liz.  She was completely naked at our last road show in Asbury Park, so.  So, I mean, you know, obviously, you know, she's a cool chick and she likes to take her clothes off.  I don't know why my brother would discourage that.  Right. 
[02:01:00]  Hey, it was a highlight of my act.  Exactly.  I know that much.  Yes, this is the lynchie.  All right.  I thought that was great.  Cool.  Thanks, Tim, and thanks, Lynch.  All right.  Talk to you guys later.  Psycho Tim going to be helping us out, I think, in the near future.  With some things in Boston, that's all.  Yeah, we'll talk about what's going on in Boston probably tomorrow.  But sure.  Basically, we're going to be up there Monday and Tuesday, the 29th and 30th of October.  Yeah.  We're going to be part of the BCN Halloween party. 
[02:01:30]  Grave rave.  Grave rave.  And we're going to be broadcasting for two days,  and we've got lots of surprises and guests planned for those shows.  Hell, yeah.  So we'll give you more details when we get closer,  but that's the deal with that.  Okay?  I don't know if we're going to be doing a full-blown road show up there in Boston.  I think we're kind of latching on to the grave rave.  Yeah.  Yeah, we're just hanging out for that, man.  That'll be a good start.  That's enough fun for me.  All right.  Finally, we've got the foul-mouthed Tom Brokaw.  Ah.  This is something that Anthony did the other day, 
[02:02:00]  and it's hilarious, and it's worth another play.  A lot of people begging to hear this again.  They want to get it on tape and stuff.  Poor Tom.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's self-explanatory, so we'll just start it up.  Okay?  Right.  All right.  Check this out.  Hello.  Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightly News.  I believe I have been exposed to the anthrax spores. 
[02:02:30]  That's where my production assistant, I know I have opened up this...  ...envelope...  ...envelope...  A letter.  A note.  No, sure.  That I had...  ...receives.  Yeah, I know.  We have a clip of Brokaw from Friday.  He was pissed.  This is a guy.  Now, he's one of these...  He's a national anchor, you know?  He keeps it cool at all times.  That's his job.  Don't matter what he's reporting.  But then...  That's how effed up this whole situation is, because you had Dan Rather on Letterman just 
[02:03:00]  breaking down.  Crying.  And you could have pissed off Tom Brokaw.  Who would ever think this guy would get pissed?  News people are not supposed to ever show any type of emotion.  No.  I mean, the best you got out of Cronkite there...  Walter Cronkite.  ...when Kennedy died was that he took his glasses off.  And?  And had a slight tear in his eye when he announced that Kennedy was dead.  Word now that President Kennedy is...  That was the closest a newsman came to, you know, showing real emotion. 
[02:03:30]  Until recently.  Now you got Dan Rather crying uncontrollably on Letterman, where Letterman has to hold  his hand.  And now you got Brokaw, you know, on Friday, completely pissed off.  Yeah, he's freaking.  So, but you know, it's...  The guy might have anthrax.  You know, that's got to make you a little angry.  And he just pretty much found out about it.  And there he is.  On the air.  Talking about it.  He went through his news thing.  And then at the end of the show, he had a voice that he was a little pissed off. 
[02:04:00]  Alright, here we go.  Brokaw.  And finally tonight, on behalf of all of us at NBC News, and especially on behalf of  our friend and colleague...  Thank you for your concern.  She has been, as she always is, a rock.  And she's been an inspiration to us all.  This is so unfair, and so outrageous, and so maddening, it's beyond my ability to express  it in socially acceptable terms.  So we'll just reserve our thoughts and our prayers for our friend and her family. 
[02:04:30]  That's nightly news for Friday.  The anger lounge.  For my colleague, I cannot express myself in socially acceptable terms. 
[02:05:00]  But mother...  I'm gonna do it anyway.  Anyway, I believe these towel-headed f*** bags should have my big Tom Brokaw foot shoved  so far up their f***ing asses.  I thought you were going somewhere else.  I'll go anywhere you want me to go with it. 
[02:05:30]  If you want to give me the anthrax, I'll give you a dose of the AIDS when I bend your towel-head  over a chair and stick my f*** so far up your f***.  You're gonna choke on it.  I'm sorry if these are socially unacceptable terms.  But my toddler, toddler, co-worker has been stricken with the anthrax that your terrorist mother 
[02:06:00]  f***ers have put in this building.  I am not gonna sit here.  Get down on the phone.  Where are those pictures I was supposed to see?  I can't come out of an up-tempo number into a goddamn dog dying.  Tom, you're not...  Hello?  No, you're not a DJ.  Oh, I'm sorry.  You're an anchorman.  Tom Broca, NBC, f***ing nightly news.  These towel-headed sand f***ers. 
[02:06:30]  Oh, wait, wait, wait, Tom.  What?  I said socially acceptable.  No.  That obviously is socially acceptable.  I know you got the anthrax.  I can't say sand f***ers.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  That's unacceptable.  That's probably not.  How about camel f***ers?  No, no, no.  Nothing like that?  No, no.  Tom Broca, NBC, nightly news.  I hate the f***ing camel f***ers.  I don't need the anthrax.  You know what I do now? 
[02:07:00]  When Tom Broca gets in a cab, I look.  If the guy has a turban on, I whip out my big fat f***er.  And I start cranking and cranking till I unload the biggest wad of f***er all over the back of his head.  I go, there's your tip, anthrax boy.  That's for my call, call, call assistant.  Assistant, yeah.  That's right. 
[02:07:30]  Sometimes if I go into a 7-Eleven convenience store.  7-Eleven, sure.  Good.  Yeah.  And I see one of these towel-headed scum, like I say that, scumbags.  Sorry.  I can't help but walk off and in the slurping machine.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Dude, Tom.  Why?  He's spreading anthrax. 
[02:08:00]  I could wipe my f***er and take a big handful of f***er and put it on all the straws that people are going to use for slurpees.  But then you're going to affect innocent people.  F***er.  Come on.  So finally, in closing on this NBC Nightly News,  is I would like to say,  Hey, you f***er.  Ass. 
[02:08:30]  Mother.  Sucking.  Douche.  S***.  Tom.  Thank you.  Tom Brokaw.  Mother.  In NBC Nightly.  In News.  Wow. 
[02:09:00]  He's so angry.  You.  No wonder we f*** them behind.  Wow.  Why didn't I think of that?  The Greaseman Show.  Bone dry.  We should, uh, no wonder they f*** them behind.  Hey, it works, sir.

[02:11:30]  What's up today, bro?  Hey, guys.  What's up?  Uh, I'm just thinking Halloween's coming up, and, uh, how about a little boob-a-lantern contest?  Boob-a-lantern.  Oh, yeah, you know.  Oh, I love it.  You know, you do a little makeup thing on top, uh, put the pictures on the website, let the guys vote.  I love, I love the idea.  Rick, write it down, boob-a-lantern contest.  We can do it.  We can do it, uh, next week.  Hey, peace, guys.  All right, thanks, bro. 
[02:12:00]  I like it.  The boob-a-lantern thing is hilarious.  We need, uh, girls with, uh, breast implants.  Yeah.  The bigger, the better.  But, yeah, any size, but the bigger, the better.  Uh, the ladies will come down here next week.  Right?  We should just do this.  What the hell?  It's a great idea.  And, uh, we learned that, um, if you take, you know, high, high-powered flashlights, and  you put them under breast implants, and you turn off all the lights.  That's so cool.  They glow like jack-o-lantern.  Yeah, their breast implants will glow.  Glow like Anja said, like jack-o-lanterns. 
[02:12:30]  Hence, boob-o-lanterns.  I say contest on.  Sounds good.  And if it works really well when we go to Boston for the, uh, the grave rave, a week  from Monday.  We could do it there.  Maybe, uh, the fine folks at WBCM will allow us to, uh, have a little boob-o-lantern contest  on their stage.  How appropriate.  We're not going to do a full-blown road show.  We're just kind of glomming on to their event.  We're going to, like, judge their, uh, they could do a little something.  Cool.  A little something-something.  That would be good, and boobs are involved, which is always fun.  Boobs, always fun. 
[02:13:00]  Fun treat.  All right, uh, ladies, would you do the boob-o-lantern contest?  We need a prize now.  We have to get this together immediately.  Immediately.  Immediately.  So, uh, we'll work on that.  But ladies, if you're, if you're game, uh, you know, give us a call.  Tell us how big your boobs are.  Right.  And if you could come in next week to do the boob-o-lantern thing.  All right?  This guy's a boy.  Uh, Dale from Jersey.  That Godsmack song isn't called Awake.  It's called Alive.  No, you are a moron.  Eh.  Wrong.  Uh, Jeff, you're next to the Opie and Anthony show. 
[02:13:30]  What's up?  Yeah, how you guys doing?  Pretty good, Jeff.  Um, I'm from Delaware.  Yeah.  I know it's an unfortunate state and all to be in, but, you know, I was wondering if you  guys are ever going to come down here, because we're kind of in the middle of the whole Philly,  D.C., all that noise.  Uh, we would love to go down to the Washington area.  Because we got a lot of rednecks around here to support you guys, and, you know, we've got  a lot of wow stickers in the area.  We're going to, uh, try to get down to D.C. very soon.  Very soon.  We're going from Delaware, though. 
[02:14:00]  Yeah.  Well, we've got to, like, uh, pick a, you know, a central location, my friend.  You're going to have to travel a little bit.  All right, all right.  We're officially on in, uh, you know, Washington, D.C.  Well, uh, yeah, I pick up from your Philly station here.  Oh, so you're like, oh, I get it.  You're in between.  So why didn't you go to the road show last night?  Oh, we got a little too hammered listening to you guys' show and pass out.  So did we doing it.  Never made it that far.  No, all right.  I got, I got one other thing.  You guys play these Longitude commercials here?  Uh, yeah.  I guess the radio station does that. 
[02:14:30]  Yeah.  Hold on.  Ben got, Ben got F'd so bad.  Ben, what's the wall?  What happened?  Ben, he got the same thing I got.  No, no, no, no.  He got it worse.  No, I saw something wigging out over there.  No, it's the, it's a picture that everyone has seen where, uh, it's a guy bending over  and he's, like, holding open his balloon knot so far that it could shove, like, uh, a soccer  ball through it.  Looks like open your mouth as wide as you possibly can and that's how wide his balloon knot is  stretched open.  And it just kept flashing up on the screen. 
[02:15:00]  Hundreds of them were hitting Ben.  Hundreds.  Was that on Instant?  Yeah.  What did the link say?  You know, I don't even know.  I don't even know how it came up because it wasn't around and then it was there.  He must have clicked on it.  Uh, Jeff.  Yeah.  Yeah, so, uh, I don't know what to tell you.  If we make it down to Washington, D.C., then, uh, you know, join us there, okay?  All right, guys.  All right, bro.  Stay it easy.  Bye.  Uh, John, what's going down, bro?  What's up, guys?  How y'all doing?  What?  What's up, guys?  How y'all doing?  Uh, we're doing all right. 
[02:15:30]  That's cool.  Yeah, I just wanted to tell y'all, I was up at the bird show last night.  And what'd you think?  I, it was awesome.  Y'all, I heard, I heard earlier in the show that y'all said that y'all didn't have any fans  from D.C. up there.  Well, you got two that came up there.  Nah, we know we have some people listening in D.C.  Yeah, it was two and a half hours drive.  We were thrown into a very strange situation down in, uh, D.C., so we're kind of just  letting it kind of settle.  Really?  How's that?  Well, Don and Mike were number one in afternoon drive down in Washington, and, uh, they moved  them to middays and brought us in a brand new show for Washington. 
[02:16:00]  Mm-hmm.  And so, you know.  Y'all blow them away.  So everyone is, uh, you know, a little bit outraged.  Uh, y'all blow them away.  So we're just, we're just letting everything settle.  Cool, cool.  And we'll, uh, we'll build our own audience, and then we'll come down there and have some fun  with you guys.  Cool, cool.  When are you planning on coming down here?  Uh, it's gonna be, uh, I don't know.  Hopefully in November we'll do something, all right?  Awesome.  All right, bro.  All right, man.  Bye.  You got it, John?  You got me so bad.  You got it in.  Let me see.  That is gross, man.  That is gross. 
[02:16:30]  Okay, look.  I'll restart.  That is so bad.  Hey, Brad, what's going on, man?  Yeah, guys, what's going on?  Hey.  Hey, I got a question for you.  Yeah.  With all this crap that went down between me and, uh, Diana last night, what's the chances  of us doing sex for Sam when you bring it to Philly?  Oh, this is Brad from earlier.  Yeah.  That, uh, was trying to have sex in the bathroom, and, uh, he got caught.  Yeah.  We wanted to do sex for Sam this time around, but, uh, we'll save it.  We'll be down there again.  That's what's up, dude. 
[02:17:00]  All right.  I had a blast last night, by the way.  Ah, cool.  Thanks.  Take it easy.  All right.  Dave, what's going on?  Dave?  Dave?  Dave?  Oh, you guys are killing us now.  We're running out of steam.  Help us.  Help us, please.  Help us.  Bo, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Um, yeah, I'm from Vegas, and I was just wondering when you guys were going to come  out here and throw in your crazy parties, man.  Ah, well, we got to do, uh, one soon, I think, for Vegas.  Sooner than later.  Yeah, you live in a really cool city, my friend. 
[02:17:30]  You're telling me, dude.  I grew up, born and raised here.  I just turned 21, so now I'm, like, hooked.  First time I went out, I hit two royal flushes on a machine.  I'm stuck now.  See, this is what I picture a Vegas band, where people that live there, just, there you go,  out and gamble.  We, we can't wait until we get a following in Vegas so we can come out and, uh, have  a party, bro.  Yeah, cool, man.  You getting some hookers?  Uh, I go to strip clubs every now and then, because I work for, uh, the Anheuser-Busch distributor  out here, so I get, you know, hooked up and stuff. 
[02:18:00]  You gotta think the strip clubs in Vegas have to try a lot harder, just because you got  all the prostitution around.  The legal prostitution.  Yeah, I don't, I don't, I don't pay for ass, you know what I'm saying?  Right.  Nah, huh?  That's a good rule of thumb.  All right, Bo.  All right, man.  Thank you.  Don't pay for your ass.  We'll get out to Vegas eventually.  It's way too early.  We're starting to feel a little buzz in Cleveland.  I think we're gonna have to do a little Cleveland trip.  Yeah?  Hell yeah.  Before Vegas?  Well, Vegas we could hit in the middle of the winter, you know what I mean?  We could do it then, too. 
[02:18:30]  Right.  Why don't we just move the show to Vegas?  Dave, what's going on?  Hey, can you hear me now?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You're killing us, man.  Hey, I don't know.  I tried talking and you didn't hear me.  No, you weren't there.  All right.  So, what's up?  All right.  I was at the show last night.  I just had a comment about some of the contestants in your beauty contest.  Okay.  In the bikini contest, okay.  Oh, just to tell Norton, too?  Yeah.  Did you actually throw the cup of AIDS on that guy later, or what?  All right.  Norton's gone, bro.  Oh, okay.  All right.  I want to know, did you see Ecstasy's rear end as she strutted down the runway? 
[02:19:00]  Ecstasy's rear end.  I remember she was a beautiful girl.  Did you notice on her right cheek of her butt, there was like an odd bump that looked  like a third butt cheek growing?  Stop.  Are you serious?  Yeah.  I was in front of the sound area, the mixing table.  Yeah.  About 20 feet from the end of the runway, and looked at her, and she walked away.  It looked like there was a third cheek trying to peek out of there on the top of her butt.  Wait, Stink, you saw it, too? 
[02:19:30]  Yeah.  What was it?  Why didn't you guys point it out?  So it was obvious.  Yeah, it was on her right cheek, and it was just like...  It's not always obvious.  You've got to point this stuff out.  You know what it kind of looks like?  Well, see, I couldn't drink last night.  I was driving.  What about the one-armed girl that time?  It wasn't obvious.  Well, we didn't notice that one.  And finally someone had to point it out.  But no, this chick's ass looked like Pat Croce.  The Bumpy showed us.  She had three cracks.  No, no, no.  It wasn't a crack. 
[02:20:00]  It was like a bump.  It was the start of a new cheek.  Yeah.  Really?  I'm sure someone has a picture of it, and they'll send it into the show, and we'll all enjoy it.  Her inner twin.  The conjoined twin.  We'll enjoy the mini-butts.  All right, guys.  You have a good day.  Thanks, Dave.  Mini-butt.  Jason, what's going on?  Yeah, what's up, guys?  Hey.  I was just wondering why implants were necessary for the boob-o-lantern concept.  Oh, my God.  We just explained it to you.  Well, I understand that they glow, but wouldn't a boob glow anyways? 
[02:20:30]  I don't think so.  No.  Have you tried it?  We could do a test tomorrow.  Let's try it.  It's like when you put a flashlight, you know.  It seems like you're eliminating a lot of good boobs by getting rid of people that don't have implants.  Yeah, that might be true.  I know that the implants work better because we did it, and the shape of the boob-o-lantern was the perfect shape of an actual implant.  And just the fact that the bag itself is full of clear liquid, you know, that kind of refracts the light a little more than, I think, flesh and fat and whatnot. 
[02:21:00]  Yeah, you know what?  I think we love the natural boobs, but I think we have to do the breast implants for the boob-o-lantern.  I mean, we can try a little test tomorrow to make sure, but I'm telling you, it's not going to be as good.  Okay.  Have you ever seen this?  No, I've never seen it.  We did it on stage once on Long Island, and it's hilarious.  The whole thing just lights up.  The whole implant.  Got to go to these home improvement stores.  Well, I'll be looking forward to the pictures, man. 
[02:21:30]  All right.  Thanks, Jason.  Take care.  We've still got to get some girls to call us up and tell us they'll do the boob-o-lantern contest.  What were you saying, Bill?  They got these new flashlights out now.  They're like 500 watts.  They're only like 15 bucks.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  That'll probably work better.  We'll get some high-powered flashlights.  Hey, which one was she?  Oh, here we go.  There is a...  Rick, where is that?  That's on opianthony.com.  They got to go to the Wall of Fame, like the last click-on section, and you can find it.  It's in 2000. 
[02:22:00]  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah, check it out.  Go back to that.  Interesting.  Wall of Fame.  That's from the Brewer Show, I think, right?  Yeah, the Brewer Show at the Vanderbilt, right?  Right.  We brought her out real fast.  2000.  And which photos?  Brewer?  Scroll down.  It just says boob-o-lantern.  We also did it in the studio.  That could be the studio show.  Oh, that.  I thought you found the third butt.  Oh, no, no, no.  Oh, okay.  There's a picture of the boob-o-lantern.  Boob-o-lantern looks like a nebula.  It shows how well it works with the rest of the place. 
[02:22:30]  That was Rhiannon, too.  Mistress Rhiannon.  Kirby.  Hey, what's up, guys?  How are you?  Oh, good.  Good.  Hey, we'll let you know, you've got fans down here in D.C.  Oh, we know, man.  We know we have some.  Hey, I'm the a-hole that called your first day down here about the first hour into your  show, and I was giving you all S.  Oh, you're that guy?  Yeah, I'm that guy.  We have one.  I bow to you guys now.  We have a guy like you in every city.  I bow to you now.  You guys are the best.  Later.  Well, spread the word, dude, and we'll get down there, all right?  Hey, you guys, don't see many stickers down here, but we get a lot of, like, trucks are 
[02:23:00]  tagged with, like, written in their dirt of the truck.  Well, you know, I mean, WJFK, they've got to commit to the show, you know?  This WOW thing works like you wouldn't believe.  I mean, Philly yesterday, everywhere you went, you saw the WOW stickers.  Yeah.  You know?  Oh, yeah.  They've got to commit, they've got to get the stickers made and get motivated and push  it, and it'll happen.  It'll work.  You won me over.  All right, thanks, Kurt.  It holds.  And take it easy, man.  Unfortunately, we can't control all the stations.  It's a lot of how they want to promote our radio show. 
[02:23:30]  But they should take some pointers from Philly, I'll tell you right now.  Larry, what's up?  What's up, guys?  Hey.  I've got to tell you, between the clips from the road show and Ozzy with his helicopter,  it's the funniest myth I've ever heard on this show.  Oh, cool.  That's number one.  Yeah.  Number two, you guys are talking about a second contest.  Whatever happened with the Naughty Nighty?  The Naughty Nighty thing, we're working out the details on that.  Oh, you're taking a long time, guys.  I've got a big screen, a big monitor for my computer just for that. 
[02:24:00]  I'm still waiting.  That contest will work.  We're trying to make it work so all the ladies all over the country can do it, and that's  where the snag is.  Yeah, you're making me work, logging on every single day looking for it.  No, no.  We'll let you know.  I mean, if you're a fan of the show, we'll push it hard.  It's going to be another couple weeks before we figure out the details.  In the meantime, the Bubo Lantern thing we can do next week.  It's easy.  And, you know, we'll get the ladies down here, and we'll have some fun with that.  So we'll do a little mini contest, and then we'll move on to the Naughty Nighty, all right?  Naughty Nighty.  Great, guys.  All right, Larry.  Keep working. 
[02:24:30]  Love yourself.  Thank you, Larry.  Take care.  Bye.  Kevin from the NYPD.  Yo, dude, NYPD checking in.  Hey.  Listen, number one, your road shows rule without a doubt, because I've been to like three of  them up here in the New York area over the last, well, the first few years, and they're  awesome.  Cool.  But why did we get out of, we get dropped out of the teen softball game number one?  Well, you know why?  Because Newark screwed us on that.  Well, what about Long Island?  They can't accommodate?  Then it was too late to reschedule. 
[02:25:00]  It's a long story for the other cities, dude.  But we wanted to do it real bad, and we got effed on that one.  Listen, stop japping out the homeboys, because we need something up here, too.  Oh, I hate when you guys say that.  We've given you guys like 12 road shows.  We're spoiled.  We need more.  And you know what?  The one we did yesterday, a lot of the audience from the New York area that is south  of the city, they all came to this.  Of course, but we had to work.  We couldn't get off.  You know, but there were so many people from New York down in Philly yesterday.  Are you planning one at least for next year, maybe? 
[02:25:30]  We'll do something sooner than that.  We did the Jay Moore benefit.  Yeah.  You know, we're out there as much as we can, so.  You guys got to keep busy, man.  We are, Kevin.  Thanks, dude.  Thanks.  Bye-bye.  Bye.  Don't hit any links, Ben, on the instant feedback.  Someone's really trying to screw with us now.  Like, I see.  I know what the links are now.  All right.  Jamie.  Yes.  How are you?  All right.  How are you?  Uh, good.  That's good.  Do you have a fire department?  Patty.  Well, my husband's in the fire department, Hook and Ladder Company, Island Park, New York. 
[02:26:00]  Yes.  And they're holding a fundraiser this Sunday, the 21st.  Okay.  And I just wanted to see if you guys would mention it.  Obviously, you are.  Yeah.  Um, it's going to be held at T.A. Clark's, 4160 Austin Boulevard in Island Park.  Okay.  Starting time is 1 o'clock.  All right.  And the proceeds are all going to three of the families that were, um, members of their family  were killed in the World Trade Center.  They were members of the fire department, the Hook and, um, the police department, and 
[02:26:30]  the port authority.  All right.  That's cool.  So, I just wanted to mention, I thank you for your time.  Uh, no problem.  I hope a lot of people go out there and support, uh, you guys.  Thank you.  If you guys are around, please, stop by.  We'd love to have you.  Uh, just email us the info.  We'll try.  What's your email?  Well, I could, can I stand in line and get it?  Just go to the website.  Okay, great.  All right.  Thank you.  Thank you.  All right.  Bye.  Bye.  There goes Jamie from Island Park.  Jay, what's up?  Hey, Jay.  Oh, my God.  Oh, oh, oh.  Okay. 
[02:27:00]  Didn't tell we had a long night last night.  Yeah.  Well, it's obvious.  Finally taking its effect.  We were partying.  All right.  Uh, we're going to play the 100 grand bit from Art to Menor World CD.  Cool.  Ah.  We gave away 100 grand.  Boston is loving this one.  Yeah.  They've been requesting this ever since we got back on the airwaves in Boston.  So, this is one of the best pranks, uh, we've ever done.  I think so.  Hi.  Hi.  Who's this?  Hey, it's Craig from Wildam.  Hey, Craig.  Uh, guess what?  Oh, did I win?  You are the 107th caller.  It's 107th caller.  It's 107th caller.  Oh, no way. 
[02:27:30]  He did it.  Tell me.  I won.  I won.  Oh, no way.  You're kidding, right?  107th.  Oh, wow.  107th caller.  Congratulations.  100 grand.  Oh, my God.  You just won 100 grand, bro.  Oh, Jesus.  Do you know what I want to do with that?  What are you going to do with 100 grand?  Oh, man.  The first thing.  I have this old.  Oh, I cannot.  Jesus.  I got to calm down.  Calm down.  Calm yourself.  I am the winner.  I'm the winner.  Well, what are you going to do with 100 grand?  Oh, man.  I got this shit box for a truck.  I've got to get a new one. 
[02:28:00]  A new truck.  Oh, that.  Wait, wait, dude.  How are you going to do that with a candy bar?  What?  How are you going to do that with a candy bar?  We just gave you 100 grand candy bar.  What do you mean?  We gave away 100 grand.  It's a candy bar, bro.  Congratulations.  What?  You just won a candy bar.  Hey, what the f*** you been saying?  I've been listening to f***ing radio for like three hours, man.  You said 100 grand.  Yeah, 100 grand.  We gave you a candy bar.  That's a candy bar.  Congratulations, buddy.  Oh, you guys are a b***h of two kids. 
[02:28:30]  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Congratulations, man.  Uh-oh.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  That was a clip from Anthony, the retarded half of the Open Anthony Show.  Anthony, Sam Adams.  Oh, yeah.  You know what I'm going to be doing?  Watching that game.  Watching the Yankees. 
[02:29:00]  And drinking Sam Adams.  Mmm.  Mmm.  Nice cold, Sam.  Well, a little hair of the dog is what they call it.  Little hair of the dog.  You know something?  Maybe tomorrow I'll drink Sam Adams.  It's a great beer.  I know you're a huge Yankee fan.  Yeah.  You'll never make it to the third inning tonight.  I know.  Once I hit that couch, it's all over.  You're going to have to tape it and watch it tomorrow and just don't put it on live TV  or anything.  Well, Sam Adams.  I'll watch it tomorrow with an ice cold Sam. 
[02:29:30]  That's right.  It's a great American beer.  And for the great American pastime.  Yeah.  All your playoff parties.  Your buds come over.  Trade up to a better beer.  It's Sam Adams.  We love it.  We drink it here.  We sure had enough yesterday.  Try it for yourself.  Sam Adams.  O.P.  Anthony.  107.  WNEW.  Phone numbers for New York.  877-692-1027. 
[02:30:00]  For everyone else listening to us, you want to get a hold of the show.  866-277-4.  Wow.  How was Spinal Tap last night, Anthony?  Oh, rock.  Yeah?  Yeah, I had a lot of fun, man.  Spinal Tap.  Saw him last night at the weekend.  Had a star-studded audience, Sophie.  A lot of people were there?  Star-studded.  Was it the place to be last night?  It seemed to be the place to be, yes.  For the likes of Penn from Penn & Teller.  The guy from Will & Grace. 
[02:30:30]  Will from Will & Grace.  Is he the gay guy?  He's one of the gay guys on the show, but I think he overcomes it out in public by just  always being wrapped around his hot wife, girlfriend, whatever she is.  It's hysterical.  Yes, I'm gay on the show, but look, I'm going to have a girl right here in front of you just  to prove I'm not.  That's going to suck that you're the gay guy.  I know.  Hit sitcom if you're not gay.  Because you know the gay guys just probably come up to him all the time.  I just love you. 
[02:31:00]  Get out of here, faggot.  So he ran to the gay guy from Will & Grace, but he's not gay.  I didn't run into him.  You know what you make it sound like?  I ran into him.  But he's not gay because he was with his hot wife or girlfriend or something, and he made  sure everyone was checking him out when he was with his hot wife or girlfriend.  Right.  Okay.  Making sure.  I got it.  And I think he was trying to be a little bit of a tough guy in front of his girlfriend.  A little tough guy.  What, slapping around a little bit?  No, that would have worked, though.  That works, too.  No, he's sitting in his seat watching Spinal Tap, and his chick is on the aisle seat, 
[02:31:30]  right?  And he's next to her.  And some people were walking in the aisle, and his girl couldn't see.  So he kind of leans over his girlfriend, taps the guy, and goes, hey, she can't see.  And the guy just turns around and goes, shut up, faggot.  He did not.  No, he moved.  But he said, shut up, faggot.  But, and then at one point they got up, and right before he sat down, someone threw  a drink in his chair.  So he sat, and his ass got wet, just like a real gay guy. 
[02:32:00]  Come on.  Gay guy's sitting in seats that people have dumped water on or something.  Anthony, we're on in San Francisco now.  Cut it out.  We're going to make a good impression for everyone listening in San Francisco.  Come on, everyone.  That's a winner.  We welcome everybody.  So what else happened at Spinal Tap?  Oh, we got a clip of somebody talking to the guy from Will and Grace.  Friggin' fag.  You want to make out or something?  That's horrible. 
[02:32:30]  That's not him.  So is Penn the one that talks or doesn't talk?  The big one.  Yeah.  The big guy that talks.  Okay.  All right.  He was there.  Also, Stephen Van Zandt from, of course, Miami Steve, E Street Band, and The Sopranos.  Now, everybody knows.  More people are coming up to him asking him about taking pictures with him because they  know him from The Sopranos than from Springsteen.  And then he's talking to me about he wants a show on WNW here in New York. 
[02:33:00]  He wants to do a what?  A talk show?  No.  He wants to do like a garage rock show.  We already have the Eddie Trunk show.  Go there on Saturday night.  And he does a good job with that.  No.  It'd be like, you know, something on the weekend where he would do something.  I'm like, all right, you know, I'll talk to Ken Stevens for you.  Bada bing.  I'm just like, hey, he was pitching you a rock show.  I do you a favor.  Maybe you do me a favor.  Bada bing.  Does he understand we don't really play music anymore on the radio station? 
[02:33:30]  That's something I don't know.  See?  Yeah.  No, I think he knows that, but I think he was pitching some kind of weekend show.  All right.  Yeah.  And Spinal Tap rocked.  You know, they did all the hits, but they were kind of, I'm sorry, they're kind of dicks.  They really are.  Well, yeah, they blew us off yesterday.  They blew everyone off.  Everybody.  It's just amazing because we presented the Spinal Tap show.  Opie and Anthony present.  Says it on the ticket.  We're concert promoters as well in our spare time. 
[02:34:00]  Yeah, for some reason.  I don't know what that entails.  We have presented Andrew Dice Clay in the past and now Spinal Tap.  So.  At the garden.  You would think if we're going to help them sell tickets for their show.  Because it wasn't sold out, right?  Yeah.  They would, I don't know, maybe, you know, come down to the station and, you know, hang  on our show.  They blew us off.  Yeah.  Totally blew us off.  And I heard they were kind of dicks to their fans and backstage last night, huh?  We're hanging out backstage and it was hard enough for me to get a pass. 
[02:34:30]  I got one pass.  And for me and my girlfriend.  And that was it.  I have my brother Joe, Cowbell Bill hanging out, Big Kev, Joe Curry.  Everyone I went with had to sit out there and then I got my messages on the phone later.  Dude, man, I guess you couldn't get us in and stuff.  But, you know, it's cool.  I enjoyed the show.  So I'm the, I'm the dick.  I'm the bad guy.  Now I'm the bad guy.  You need a person like me.  You need me. 
[02:35:00]  I'm the bad guy.  You got to take care of your entourage, Anthony.  Well, I didn't see anybody.  I saw fleeting glimpses of people that were in Spinal Tap.  The Anthony entourage.  My entourage.  My peeps.  I'm like P. Diddy.  I'm P. Diddy.  I'm P. Diddy.  P. Diddy.  So I go back there.  I barely see Spinal Tap.  You know, the guys.  They leave through the back door to go to their limos.  There's people waiting outside for autographs.  Not a lot of people.  But there's like guys waiting out there for some autographs with some Spinal Tap memorabilia. 
[02:35:30]  Nothing.  They walked right past them.  Right past them.  Maybe they were, you know, trying to be rock stars.  Hey, look.  You know, you're taking your Spinal Tap thing a little too friggin' seriously.  It was a goof band, a movie, back in like 1982, 83.  Maybe they're gay.  Maybe they're gay.  Hey, faggot.  Maybe they're...  Nice head, dicks.  Where you going?  You two big now, faggots?  You sucked on SNL, dick!  Jim Brewer in the studio. 
[02:36:00]  Jim Brewer.  I made for you, faggy!  Were you on SNL during the time any of them were on?  No.  No?  They missed each other.  Right, right.  Really?  Michael McCann wasn't on, like, a part-time thing?  No.  He was on for, what, a season?  Yeah, I know.  Well, those guys are.  They were on for like 10 minutes.  Yeah, Christopher Gass.  The only one that was on a short amount of time was Anthony Michael Hall.  God, do you remember that?  Oh, yeah.  The Anthony Michael Hall month.  Wasn't that Julia Dreyfuss, too? 
[02:36:30]  Yeah, yeah, she was on, sure.  Michael Anthony was on a tear, too.  I mean, he kind of had the gayish geek thing going, but you loved him.  Because he got high in that movie.  He had that growth spurt, and it was all over.  And then all of a sudden, I was like, what happened?  Now I think he's in that.  I think he's in that movie, that Def Leppard VH1 production.  What?  Who's he playing?  I don't know who he's playing, but he's definitely in the Def Leppard movie.  He's playing the drummer's leg.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Def Leppard movie, tomorrow night in VH1. 
[02:37:00]  Def Leppard made a movie?  It's a VH1 movie.  It's a VH1 movie.  Like, they cast it in?  No, no, it's not them.  They cast people as Def Leppard, which is hysterical.  Where did they get the one-armed actor from?  I have no idea.  Arm, leg, whatever.  Arm?  No, I know.  But who cares?  I know my amputees.  Arm, leg, whatever.  I know my amputees.  So I saw some dramatic moments of him in the hospital, you know, and the fake Def Leppard  talking to him, you know, trying to act like Def Leppard. 
[02:37:30]  We're still going to be a band.  Yeah, stuff like that.  We're still going to rock it.  We're going to still be a band.  We're not giving up on Def Leppard.  No.  We're going to still be a band.  Photograph will live on.  We'll be back with more of the Def Leppard story on VH1.  So back to Spinal Tap.  Back here.  Back here.  Shut up.  Yeah, both of them, shut up. 
[02:38:00]  How annoyed must the roommates at Oskar be?  Food, shut up, bitch, shut up.  Yeah, here we go.  PH1 Behind the Music presents  Def Leppard, but not really Def Leppard,  in the Not Really Def Leppard story.  And the guy with the missing arm,  but he's not really missing arm.  How did they do that?  We'll show you on Behind the Def Leppard movie, 
[02:38:30]  Behind the Music.  See how they struggled on to perform songs like Love Bite.  Love Bite.  When you need this.  Pour some sugar on me and rock it.  Watch how they were gang-raved by five black rappers  after a concert one day and still survived on.  Make your own British flag shorts.  Just like the drummer, the movie Hysteria.  Jeff Leppard, starring people that kind of look like Jeff Leppard. 
[02:39:00]  I'm there.  I'm there.  That says watch me.  How cheesy was the blonde guy?  Remember the blonde guy?  They all were blonde, no?  Tight pants.  No, no, no, no, the short blonde hair guy.  Hey, and then the guy died.  Wait a minute, the one long hair guy died.  Did he shoot himself or something?  No, he got like so effed up all the time on booze and drugs.  Oh, that's got to be a great part of the movie, too.  Oh, bandmates dead, but the band's got to go on.  We're missing a leg in a play. 
[02:39:30]  Oh, my God, my foot fell off, but we could still be a band.  See, Def Leppard, as they transform into a band of nothing but heads.  Head singing heads.  My body rotted off, but we're still a band.  We've got to keep Def Leppard together.  He's singing heads.  They're bringing their heads out.  Shut up, they're bringing them out.  Look, it's the heads. 
[02:40:00]  They're putting them on the stool, bitch.  A story of courage and bravery, as Def Leppard is just heads.  Def heads.  I had to learn how to play the guitar all over again when I was just a head.  It's hard to re- I had to re-teach myself guitar.  Of course, I had to play with me tongue.  With special gifts, Ozzy Osbourne, as he comes in and grabs one head and bites it in half.  And then shoves the other half in his poop.  There's quite many. 
[02:40:30]  I love that whole stage and he shuts the head.  I figured we would snort some lines.  It's just a head that cocaine came right out the neck.  I figured when you were saying it, it's this much said.  See, the story of courage and bravery.  A story no one gives a flying F about.  Def Leppard in Torso Rock. 
[02:41:00]  See, they're choking on their own vomit stories.  Def Leppard hysteria.  I don't know what they're saying either.  It was great.  We're all still buds from long ago.  And no matter how many body parts fall off, we got to keep the band together. 
[02:41:30]  We were a few, so I remember one time we went out with Metallica and they used our heads for kickballs.  It was not...  I remember one time the bass player, you know, he's still just a head, decided to take a drive.  And he got in a horrible accident and lost his ears.  And since he played the bass with his ears on his head, he had to teach himself all over how to play without the ears.  Hysteria. 
[02:42:00]  See how one of them finally went into a movie career and entered the movie Castaway.  The Roadshow.  The stage production, London of Castaway.  What was the guy's name, Castaway?  The part of Wilson.  Wilson.  Wilson!  We've got to sort of say he's been named a Wilson.  Wilson!  Hey, Matt, what's up?  Yes, I got a real good feeling that they're going to have to change the name of that movie to Hysterical. 
[02:42:30]  Yeah.  Hysterical.  We're going to have a big, big herb tomorrow.  Do some bong hits.  It's going to be phony.  Right on.  They got the bad wig jobs and stuff.  Yeah, the bad 80s British rock guy wigs.  That just look really bad.  Even Spinal Tap's wigs last night were just like really bad.  Like for the movie, they were bad, but they kind of got...  And then I saw him backstage, the Spinal Tap guys, just kind of walking around because  they weren't hanging with anybody.  And it was frightening because they come out and Christopher Guest, I mean, completely 
[02:43:00]  bald.  He's gray, like beard.  Fat.  Yeah.  And you're like, wait a minute.  That's not Nigel.  What happened to Nigel?  What happened to Nigel?  I knew you should have given him the big bread.  He wanted big bread.  How many times do you think he sits in a bar and someone goes, hey man, say, this one  goes up to 11.  Hey, this one goes up to 11. 
[02:43:30]  Oh, wait, I don't even have the accent.  Look, could you shut up?  That's not what it says.  Do the accent, man.  No, really.  I'm really busy.  Say 11.  They have the mini Stonehenge?  Yeah, the little Stonehenge came down.  And oh, how they danced to little children of Stonehenge.  And the Stonehenge comes down and the little dwarf dances around it.  Yeah, it was pretty good.  Were they in the pods?  No, they didn't have anything like that.  Oh, they didn't do the pods? 
[02:44:00]  No, and it was sponsored by some kind of fake, like, Depend undergarment.  So they had, like, big flyers in the back for these fake undergarments.  There it is.  Long ago, before the dawn of history.  Hundreds of years before the dawn of history.  Left a strange race of people.  The Druids. 
[02:44:30]  You've seen that movie too many times.  Yeah, you've got to get out of the house.  Tony, what's up?  Who doesn't love the movie?  The guys are dicks, but...  Brewer's a sick bastard, man.  Oh, we love Jim Brewer.  Dude, buddies of mine went to the show.  Yeah.  Best way to piss them off.  Say, hey, where's Squiggy, dick?  Oh, Michael McKeon?  Dude, he had a...  Where's Squiggy, dick?  Wait, you guys actually did that?  Friends of mine did.  They wouldn't give him autographs.  Where's Squiggy, dick?  They were being dick, so he goes, hey, where's Squiggy, dick? 
[02:45:00]  Welcome to Michael McKeon.  Hello.  Dude, he's showing him off.  Hey, hey, Levine.  That's funny.  That is very funny.  Hello, Levine.  Hey, hey, dick, where's Squiggy?  Thank you.  Good night.  Where's Squiggy, dick?  Yeah, I see you in Oceanside, faggot.  Where's Squiggy?  Well, where the pansies live, and they do live well.  So many, where were my...  Hysteria.  You wouldn't even know that we're playing Spinal Tap music  because we couldn't get the rights to the real music. 
[02:45:30]  I wonder if they performed the Def Leppard songs  or if they actually got permission to use the songs.  It was just a band cover band version.  I remember hating him so much one time,  I'd go out and beat Mexicans for that one video.  What was it, once bitten?  Remember?  He was so over-exaggerating.  That was great.  He'd go up, no, no, no.  He'd go, when you make love...  Oh, that one.  Yeah.  When you're looking at me...  I'm going to get drunk and fight a Mexican.  Enough already.  What the hell does that mean? 
[02:46:00]  The chicks loved them.  The chicks really liked them.  And the bad videos.  That was like at the beginning of MTV  with the swords and the chicks in the cages and stuff.  Like, what does this even mean?  The photograph was kind of a story.  Wasn't it like the Marilyn Monroe kind of story going on?  They were taking pictures of Marilyn Monroe. 
[02:46:30]  Wow, this is so good.  One of the eight videos they played on MTV  before they went...  And showed the Apollo rocket taking off 800 minutes.  Was that guy a black guy?  Remember the one guy?  The big...  G.G. Jackson.  G.G. Jackson.  All right, it's G.G. Jackson here.  And we're going to premiere Thriller for you tonight.  Great, G.G.  Great.  They gave G.G. all the black artists.  You'd be banging your pillow to Nina Hartley?  Oh, Nina Blackwood.  Nina Blackwood.  And she looked just like a space cadet. 
[02:47:00]  Martha Quinn.  She looked like she was on the dope.  Alan Hunter.  Martha Quinn was like the homebody.  Alan Hunter, wow.  Mark Goodman.  Mark Goodman.  Yeah, Martha Quinn was like the homebody chick.  The girl next door one.  And then there was Nina Blackwood.  The rock who...  Hey, you're a rock who...  You know, she was just...  D-R-R-W.  You just know she was honing everyone's knob.  She's like, hey, look who's here, man.  Take your shirt off. 
[02:47:30]  See what you got, you D-L-R-W.  Nina, let's see your boobies.  She's a dirty little rock who...  We should take a break.  All right.  Hey, Jim Brewer's here to hang with us for a while, man.  Nice.  Brewer.  Nice visit, Dick.  Finally.  Jesus.  We kept saying, Brewer's on today.  We're psyched.  Brewer coming in.  No, Brewer's not coming in.  What happened?  Wow.  He couldn't get a sitter, I hear, the other day.  Nice.  Dick. 
[02:48:00]  A sitter.  A real man.  Look at Brewer.  He's playing all our cities, man, that we're in.  Oh.  Since Dallas, San Francisco, Chicago, Cleveland, Columbus, and Philadelphia.  On the Hysteria Tour.  All covered by VH1.  Okay.  We were playing?  I know, exactly.  What?  When it gets closer, we'll tell everyone.  What time is it?  Yeah.  Want to talk to Jim Brewer or hang with us today?  866-277-4-WOW.  Our listeners are so quick and with it.  Steven. 
[02:48:30]  Or whoever your name is.  All right.  Steve?  Yeah, well, yes, you.  You just spoke.  Go ahead.  Talk.  You.  Yeah, me.  Yeah, what's your name?  Steven.  Well, what?  You f***ing a**hole.  Oh, my God.  Son of a b**ch.  Oh, he's very upset.  All I want to do is to bet.  How stupid do you have to be to be on the phone and someone calls your name and you don't answer? 
[02:49:00]  All I want to do is to be so.  Shut up!  Shut up!  Shut up!  You f***ing a**hole!  Shut up!  You f***ing a**hole!  Shut up!  Shut up!  Shut up!  Shut up!  Ah!  Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!  Did he just lose his effing mind?  No!  Opie and Anthony.  I hate people that don't get it. 
[02:49:30]  God damn does that piss me off!  I'm a freaking lunatic.  You are.  You are.  Thank you. </pre>
