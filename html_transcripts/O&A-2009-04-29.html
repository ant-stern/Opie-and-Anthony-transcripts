<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often transitioning abruptly between them.  The show opened with a discussion of the swine flu outbreak and the Air Force photo op over lower Manhattan.  The hosts expressed skepticism about the media's portrayal of the swine flu's severity, questioning the accuracy of reported death tolls and suggesting fear-mongering was at play.  They also debated the impact of the name "swine flu" on the pork industry.  The Air Force photo op generated considerable discussion, with the hosts playing several 911 calls highlighting the public's fear and confusion caused by the low-flying plane near Ground Zero. They criticized the decision to conduct the photo op without warning, speculating on the motivations behind it and the resulting White House inquiry.  Audio clips included 911 calls from the incident, a segment from a British talent show featuring a surprisingly talented young girl, and humorous clips from the hosts' "Real Rock TV" project, showcasing pranks like ordering a single slice of cheese at a drive-thru and throwing a milkshake back at the employee.  They also touched upon Arlen Specter's party switch.

The show continued with more discussion about the swine flu, this time alongside speculation about the potential legalization of marijuana and its potential tax revenue implications.  Listeners called in to contribute to a segment inventing creative flu names and to offer opinions on marijuana legalization and drug testing.  Bill Burr was in studio during this segment, and a clip from Colin Quinn's *PFG TV* was teased.  A *Family Guy* song referencing marijuana was played, and the conversation included significant amounts of crude and sexually explicit humor, including jokes about bestiality.

The next segment began with humorous listener emails about a chihuahua blown away by wind and comparing swine flu to cat scratch fever.  The hosts then discussed a 21-year-old Cincinnati man who dressed as a superhero and fought crime, referring to him as a "retard."  The conversation then returned to the chihuahua story, featuring exaggerated descriptions and a news report, followed by the surprising news that the chihuahua, Tinkerbell, was found with the help of a psychic.  The hosts reacted with disbelief and mockery.  The Cincinnati superhero, "Shadow Hair," was discussed at length, along with other members of the "World Superhero Registry," generating considerable ridicule.  The segment shifted to a discussion of unusual tourist attractions, and then to an in-studio interview with Tommy Shaw of Styx and Damn Yankees.  They discussed Shaw's career, including his experiences with Dennis DeYoung, and Shaw performed a snippet of "Come Again."  The interview also covered his personal life and health, and concluded with a promotional call from Jay Moore.

A subsequent segment featured a longer interview with Tommy Shaw, delving deeper into his career with Styx, including band conflicts, the reunion, and creative differences with Dennis DeYoung.  He also discussed working with Ted Nugent and performed an acoustic version of "Fooling Yourself."  The conversation then moved to Colin Quinn's weight loss and his upcoming show.  A significant portion focused on reminiscing about and playing clips from a previous segment featuring "Scorch," a recurring character known for offensive behavior.  The segment ended with further discussion of Scorch's television show and Jimmy Norton's avoidance of a promotional appearance.  Offensive language and references were frequent.

The final segment discussed a comedian, Jim, and his anger over promotional material referring to him vaguely as "the other guy from Opie and Anthony."  The hosts tried to calm him, speculating on who else might be involved, mentioning Rich Voss.  The discussion included an anecdote about a black and white penis prop used in a stand-up routine.  Scorch, described as Opie's first intern, was a guest, sharing stories from their history.  Other guests included Scott Shannon and mentions of Stephen King, along with several other comedians.  Extensive promotion of Colin Quinn's one-man show was featured.  The segment also included numerous references to other comedians and further mentions of guests scheduled for the next day, including Bill Burr and the Iron Sheik.  The chaotic banter continued, referencing Tony Danza, Bob Kelly, and Kiefer Sutherland, along with jokes about Jim's "charitable shitty attitude" and promotional efforts.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver! Let's get the show on the road!  Opinion Anthony.  Oh wow.  That was a little loud.  Is it?  Too loud? How about that?  A little better.  How about that? How about that?  That's betterer.  So we're all going to get sick, and then we're going to think it's the swine flu.  The swine flu. 
[00:00:30]  Well, we're going to get sick because it's going to be 30 degrees colder today than yesterday.  I brung my jacket.  Yo.  I knew.  Yesterday was like 90. Today it's going to be about 60, 65.  It was so goddamn nice yesterday.  It was too nice.  Beautiful.  Don't you like that spring?  Heat!  I don't like going from winter to summer.  I don't like that either. 
[00:01:00]  I mean, I do like spring, and we missed it.  Now, pour on the heat.  I don't care.  It's much better than cold.  The hotter, the better for you.  Yes.  I kind of like that in between.  Wear a little spring jacket.  Nah, then the...  You don't like wearing a little spring jacket?  No, the pool gets heated up.  I like wearing my new sneakers.  I don't want to go right to flip-flops.  Time to party.  I don't want to go right to jean shorts with my hairy legs.  The mics suck, by the way, Mars.  Do they?  Yeah.  Whoa, whoa, whoa. 
[00:01:30]  Yours sounds all right.  Yeah, maybe?  Then maybe it's in my head.  Maybe the headphones.  Yeah?  We have to tweak every day.  Who was in here yesterday?  Because all the knobs were different.  Department of Sanitation show.  Like, everybody's got a show, and they all use our studio.  Might as well follow up garbage with garbage.  Oh, good gravy.  Good gosh.  The swine flu, by the way?  Yeah.  This is what I need in my little world. 
[00:02:00]  I need one news station that is guaranteed to give me the facts.  Yeah.  That's not asking for much.  When I was growing up, you just assumed you were watching the news.  They were giving you the facts.  And I don't even know if they were anymore, but it seemed like they did a better job just  giving you the facts when we were growing up.  Mm-hmm.  80s, late 70s, you know, when we started, you know, paying attention to things.  Yeah.  Now, you don't know what the fuck to think, because these asshole news programs are all 
[00:02:30]  looking for ratings, so they're scaring the shit out of everybody, and we don't know  what's up.  Is the swine flu going to kill a lot of people, or is it just like any other flu that kills  a lot of people?  Kills a lot of people every year.  What is it, really?  Dr. Sanjay Gupta's down in Mexico.  Yeah, but he's, you know, you gotta watch, have you ever watched Outfoxed?  Oh, yeah.  I know that's skewed and all, I get it, but there's parts of that documentary where they  explain all this.  If you're, what is his name again, the Gupta? 
[00:03:00]  Dr. Sanjay Gupta.  Gupta.  If Dr. Sanjay Gupta wants to continue to have airtime, he's gonna kind of like, you  know, stretch the truth a little bit.  Yeah.  And keep the fear going.  Mm-hmm.  Because it's all about ratings, because they're all looking for the advertising dollars.  So we suffer in the end, and we don't know what the fuck is going on.  We don't know if this swine flu is something to worry about.  We really don't.  Just 30,000 people a year die from the flu. 
[00:03:30]  Across the world?  From just the flu.  The world or the United States?  No, I think that's Americans.  Nah, really?  We could get rid of 30,000, can't we?  No, maybe it's the world.  Mm-hmm.  See, I don't even have the facts straight, but at least I'm telling you I don't.  But even, you know, let's say it's the world.  I would say it's gotta be more than 30,000 in the world.  That's, the world's fucking huge.  So what does...  If the flu, they fucking drop dead, who can tell?  So what does the swine flu mean?  That 31,000 people would die?  30,000 in the U.S.  It's 30,000 people in the United States a year die from the flu. 
[00:04:00]  Yeah, the flu is a dangerous thing.  You would be, like, freaking out if all of a sudden, like they told you,  10,000 people have now died of the swine flu in these states.  You'd be like, ah!  But they tell you, like, well, this school had five cases, and this has one,  and Nassau County's got a case.  Well, I got the sniffles today.  Do I worry?  What's up?  What's up?  Jimmy's got a bit of a scratchy throat. 
[00:04:30]  You know, should we be worried?  We don't know by watching the news.  They suck a big dick.  It really is ridiculous.  Oh, there's...  Oh, why?  Is this people calling 911?  What?  Was this the 911 calls about the plane flying over New York City?  Yeah.  Everyone is running.  People are crying and panicking.  Calm down.  Well, the big headline there, and once again, I don't know what to believe. 
[00:05:00]  They knew this would cause panic, but they did it anyway.  They did it anyway.  Who the fuck would go, well, we know this is going to create a massive panic in lower Manhattan,  but let's do it anyway.  That plane is making some amazing maneuvers above a city.  It really did look like it wanted to wreak some havoc.  It's being followed by an F-16, so you're thinking maybe that, you know, there's shenanigans going on,  and the F-16's trying to fix it to do something. 
[00:05:30]  To blow it out of the sky.  People are freaking out.  But how amazing would that be?  I'd be the guy like, wow, that's cool.  They just blew this plane out of the sky.  And it said that, oh, it cost $328,000 to do that, and Obama's furious.  That's nothing, though.  But I heard last night, too, that they can't even tell where this came from,  or they're not telling where this whole order to fly this fucking Air Force Two, I think it is. 
[00:06:00]  It's not even Air Force One.  around Manhattan, and Obama's furious.  And then I hear people saying, well, shouldn't the White House know if one of their planes are going to be buzzing Manhattan?  And then other people are just saying, you know, Photoshop, what's wrong with you?  You take a picture of the city, and you take a picture of this plane, and you put it in.  They're behind.  The government just discovered MySpace.  Stop.  They don't know how to Photoshop. 
[00:06:30]  Yes.  But wait, wasn't that for people on the plane?  That wasn't for people...  Microsoft Paint.  No, Jimmy.  Who was the photo op for?  It was just a show like Air Force One over, like, cool stuff.  Yeah, they usually, like, have pictures.  Even though it was Air Force Two, but it looks like Air Force One.  Let's say you go to, like, the White House, and you go to the gift shop, and you want to buy a picture of Air Force One flying over various cities.  They'll have a picture of Air Force One over Manhattan, and they can buy that picture. 
[00:07:00]  So that was the photo op.  Isn't that ridiculous?  I think there's a bunch of rich people on the plane taking pictures of Manhattan.  No.  No.  Aren't we supposed to be saving money, the government?  I think so.  That's a quick $328,000.  Silly, right?  I know that's a little drop in the bucket for the government, but, like Ann said, the photoshopping is terrific these days.  Yeah, how about that?  There you go.  Save the $328,000.  Pay some college kid a few thousand.  He'll give you some nice postcards.  And the FAA knew about it. 
[00:07:30]  They had told the FAA, and the FAA chief said, hey, this is going to cause some shit.  Perhaps we ought to tell Mayor Bloomberg or somebody, and he could get the word out that this is going to happen.  And the Department of Defense said, nah.  Nah.  Screw it.  Nah.  Yeah.  Nah.  And the FAA, who I think is, you know, as far as flying things go, they're pretty much at the tops. 
[00:08:00]  They told them, this is probably going to cause panic.  You can't fly a 747 at 1,500 feet above Manhattan without some people maybe, you know, having a little flashback.  And that's exactly what happened.  They're letting the 911 calls out.  Yeah.  Can we get the 911 calls?  Some of the people are losing their minds.  Where am I looking?  Over here? 
[00:08:30]  Okay.  Yeah, let's take a listen to this.  Well, these are the people that should get the swine flu, obviously.  Oh, that's not true, right?  What happened?  Someone here is saying they were shooting Soul Plane 2.  President is in the house.  Soul Plane.  The White House says an inquiry will take place into a photo shoot that sent thousands of New Yorkers scrambling Monday.  The public...  Glad we're getting our news from Hank Hill.  The White House said... 
[00:09:00]  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Oh, my God.  Whoa.  That plane could have been full of propane.  Is Bobby going to be doing sports?  That guy's voice is awful.  It's a more efficient fuel.  The White House says an inquiry will take place into a photo shoot that sent thousands of New Yorkers scrambling Monday.  The public relations stunt had a presidential plane flanked by an F-16 fighter flying along the New York City skyline.  We want to know what's going on because there's like planes, look, they're going inside the building.  Everybody's outside going crazy. 
[00:09:30]  What?  It looks like planes are going, they're trying to go in the building.  Everybody's outside going crazy.  What's trying to go in the building?  It doesn't sound like a plane or trying to go into one of the buildings.  A plane.  The White House military office approved that.  That woman's an idiot.  What a boob.  But I love the 9-1-1 operator just questioning if the planes are trying to go in the building.  That is an idiot that can't convey what she wants to tell this person.  There's planes trying to go in the building. 
[00:10:00]  What, knocking on the door?  What are they doing?  The White House military office approved the photo op, which will end up costing taxpayers more than $320,000.  The cost of the fuel alone for the plane and two fighter jets, $35,000.  We were involved in this.  There clearly were people in this building who had some sort of advance notification about this.  In retrospect, would we have liked somebody to raise their hand and say, this is not a good idea? 
[00:10:30]  Absolutely.  We would have preferred that.  Unfortunately, that did not happen.  Planes trying to get in the building, but it forgot its ID.  Security has it downstairs.  They had a very important task downstairs today.  Very important task.  What a catastrophe.  I don't know if the rest of the country could fully relate to what we have to deal with by going in and out of these buildings here in New York City.  You've got these animals that work the front door in these buildings, and they think they're the most important person walking the face of the earth. 
[00:11:00]  Yeah.  And today's job was we have to close the one entrance and tell everyone to go to the other entrance.  Yeah.  A lot of cones were outside.  A lot of cones, they had to probably, they had to get here a little early to put the cones up.  They probably got an alert.  All right.  Yeah.  Suiting up with his uniform earlier in the morning in the mirror.  Got to go, honey.  Yeah.  Big things are happening at work.  And we still walked to the front door, and there was no reason whatsoever why we couldn't still walk in that door. 
[00:11:30]  Of course not.  So they made us go circling the block and go into the other side of the building.  It was a big deal for these guys.  Big deal.  Kenny called me.  Do you think they're going to be at a bar later just talking about their big day as the security animals that they are?  Well, we had a tough one today.  We had to close one entrance and open another one and divert everyone to the other side of the building.  Yeah.  It was a rough, rough day.  Kenny gave me a call.  You've got to go around to the other side. 
[00:12:00]  Yeah.  What?  Other side?  What?  Yeah.  So stupid.  The sight of the plane this Monday evoked chilling memories of 9-11, while the police department and other agencies...  No, it didn't.  Stop with the exaggeration of everything.  I didn't see it.  Someone tell me what news station I could watch where they're going to just give me the facts, and we will promote the fuck out of it.  Just basic.  This is really what it is right here.  We know we're not going to get ratings.  Nothing.  Here it is.  Boom.  This wasn't a big deal. 
[00:12:30]  Swine flu is going to kill maybe a couple hundred extra more people than the regular flu.  That's all you have to worry about there.  Just give me the facts.  I think CNN.  Oof.  Maybe PBS probably, of all of them.  BBC.  No, BBC is anti-American.  Yeah, they don't acknowledge that we're a powerhouse in the world.  If you listen to the BBC, we're right next to the story about Zimbabwe.  Yeah, they don't care.  They don't care.  If you knew about the exercise, Mayor Michael Bloomberg remained in the dark. 
[00:13:00]  Why the Defense Department wanted to do a photo op right around the site of the World Trade Center catastrophe defies imagination.  It is absolutely outrageous and appalling to think that the FAA would plan such a photo shoot and not warn the public,  knowing full well New Yorkers still have the vivid memory of 9-11 sketched in their minds.  White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said Tuesday an inquiry into who authorized the photo op will take place. 
[00:13:30]  Reports say President Obama was said to be fuming about Monday's exercise,  adding that he didn't think Air Force One needed a new publicity photo anyway.  The President added a stunt like this will never happen again.  A similar photo shoot using the same plane flying over the nation's capital has been canceled.  Someone knows who did it because someone knows I authorized that and he's not confessing.  It's called duck and cover, my friend. 
[00:14:00]  Duck and cover your ass.  No one knows.  No one knows.  No one's going to know who authorized it.  Well, this one said that.  It's a big pass-the-buck bullshit story in Washington.  They're getting worse and worse.  And now the latest dickhead of the year is Arlen Specter, who decided to become a Democrat.  God bless the guy.  God bless the guy.  Going with his heart. 
[00:14:30]  Yeah, his heart.  If that was the case, I wouldn't even mind.  Why is he switching parties?  I wouldn't even mind.  The great senator from?  Pennsylvania.  Pennsylvania.  I should know that one.  I wouldn't even mind if it was like, you know something, I really don't feel like the Republican Party is for me anymore, and I'm switching to the Democratic Party.  He was getting his ass handed to him in the polls as a Republican, and he knew he couldn't win as a Republican. 
[00:15:00]  So to just win an election, he changes to the Democratic Party.  They've been doing that for years.  And he's been, yeah, you know something?  Yeah, but this is the most blatant case of that that people have ever seen.  He's even said it.  I mean, and he's only a Republican because that, at the time, was getting him votes.  He switches back and forth.  Whatever party he can win under, that's what he'll switch to. 
[00:15:30]  He's a big, phony piece of shit and good riddance.  Take it easy.  Goodbye.  I hope a Republican beats you when you're up for election.  The whole system sucks.  Really dope.  These politicians are worse than ever.  You shouldn't be allowed to switch parties like that.  No.  There should be some strict guidelines to switching parties.  Don't you think?  And it really...  Because you've got a lot of, like, rah-rah, you know, supporters that are all about the party. 
[00:16:00]  Yeah.  And you're their party guy.  And then you're just saying, ah, fuck that.  I'm going over here now.  With all the votes I got from you people.  Yeah.  Basically.  How much time did he have left before his next election?  I don't know.  You should have to do that after your...  It should be really...  You can't...  You should be able to do that, like, one time, one time only, and it has to have very strict guidelines.  It was close enough to know that he was going to lose.  He knew he'd lose as a Republican.  He knew he'd lose.  So he changed his party.  Just for him.  You should have to do that after you're out. 
[00:16:30]  Like, you shouldn't be able to do that.  Yeah.  What the fuck is that?  I know.  The guy's a piece of shit, and good riddance.  Goodbye.  I hope you lose.  And, uh, man.  Are you saying good riddance because you're a Republican?  No, because he's a dick.  Yeah.  And he can, you know...  He's been a liberal ass anyway.  He runs, and even when he was a Republican, he'd run on a very Republican, conservative platform.  And then once he won, he'd completely flip around and become a pretty liberal Democrat in his voting. 
[00:17:00]  So he's just been a phony piece of shit for years.  And bye-bye.  So long.  See you later.  Bye-bye.  Hope he loses.  Hope an election does come up.  A Republican does win.  That would be hysterical.  Oh, I can't wait to hear the ads, too.  It's going to be, what party does he belong to this year?  Would you vote for a man who changes party affiliations? 
[00:17:30]  Ah, he'll still win.  Yeah, probably.  And now the Senate's going to have the...  Oh, my God!  I think I got the swine flu!  Oh, Jesus.  What?  Sorry.  Now the Senate's going to have the numbers they need where, you know, Obama will pretty much have free reign.  Perfect.  Yeah.  Great.  Might as well have it all on one side, see what they can do.  Wonderful.  Guess who's pissed off at the swine flu?  Who?  Guess.  Kermit the Frog? 
[00:18:00]  I like playing guess.  Obama?  Nah.  He knows what's up.  But he's not going to let that out of the bag because he's like, oh, good, distractions.  Oh, yeah.  They love distractions.  Presidents love distractions.  The presidents love them.  So he knows what's up, but he's not going to tell the folks out there that this is just a little worse than the regular flu.  No.  And the big scare...  It's not even worse, by the way.  Well, the big scare tactic today was people are dying from the swine flu in Mexico, and they will be dying here in America, too. 
[00:18:30]  Dude, that was the biggest scary thing that I heard.  They were like, you know, there haven't been any deaths related to the swine flu in the United States, but I'm sorry to say that there probably will be deaths.  And then you do a little research.  You go, well, yeah, people died from the regular flu.  So, okay, they're going to continue dying from some form of flu.  So, yeah.  You want to guess who's really pissed off about the swine flu? 
[00:19:00]  The president, nah.  They love distractions, so that's out.  Pork industry.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, Jimmy.  People who make bacon and ham.  Bring it together.  Bring it together.  Big farmers.  Ah!  Your U.S. officials are considering a name change for the swine flu.  Farmers say the nickname is sinking their profits.  There's concern the name may confuse people into thinking they can catch the virus by eating pork. 
[00:19:30]  Some of the new names suggested are the novel flu and the North American influenza.  The World Health Organization has no plans to change the name.  No, we like to keep it basic, the swine flu.  It'll keep people away from pigs that might keep the numbers down.  You can't have some, like, generic name for the flu and then have kids petting pigs all over the world.  It's been a swine flu for forever.  Right.  Suck it up.  It'll call it the, what's her name, Boyle. 
[00:20:00]  The Susan Boyle flu.  That slob.  Yeah, but now we're here and she might be the third best in that Britain's Got Talent.  She was number one.  Yeah, she was number one.  The monster was number one and then they had the little black kid.  Little black kid.  Imitating Michael Jackson, which played for you.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah, or something.  Oh.  He's English black.  It's different.  Indian or something.  Pakistani.  Ah, he's dark.  He's black.  Then, apparently, this 10-year-old girl comes out and she's a little ballerina. 
[00:20:30]  She's going to do a little ballerina dance.  So, she starts doing a little ballerina dance and it wasn't looking like she was going to pull through.  Actually, it looked like, what's his name there?  Mr. Angry was ready to.  Simon Cowell?  Yeah, Simon was ready to hit the old buzzer on her or something.  Oh, no.  What happened?  Well, right before that, she starts belting out a song out of this little, little mouth.  And, uh, like an angel. 
[00:21:00]  Her voice like an angel.  Do we have that?  Let's listen to this bitch.  My name's Holly Steele.  I'm 10 years old.  And I live in Atkinson and I go to school.  I live in Atkinson.  Is it magic?  No, no, no.  Juggling.  This is all the preliminary happy horse shit.  Just slide it up until she hits the fucking stage or something.  Slide it up to the point where she hits the note.  British or idiocy.  Actually, see, she gets out. 
[00:21:30]  Oh, not yet.  Yeah.  It is the ballet part.  Yeah.  Just picture ballet, ballet, ballet.  She's doing it.  And Simon doesn't look happy.  It's purposefully average.  Tiki-towing.  Tiki-towing.  Yes.  Yes.  Cute little girl.  Ballet.  Hopping around on her.  Simon's ready to hit it.  And then this hand.  Oh, God.  It's so funny.  Fucking English TV stinks. 
[00:22:00]  Who doesn't like saying dance like that?  Darnsed.  I could have danced.  Darnsed.  Darnsed.  I've never done before  I never knew  But you made it so exciting  While it warms my heart  Thank you  I only know  We've begun to die 
[00:22:30]  Boring  Boring  Stuffy horse shit  Okay, terrific  Boo!  No?  I am fucking so sick  Of seeing Simon's  I can't believe what I'm seeing  Oh my god  He was ready  He had his hand up  He's ready to hit the buzzer  Here's what they do  So the girl kind of looks  And then they show backstage  Bam, the music is hit 
[00:23:00]  Cue the music  And right away she starts singing  And Simon goes  His face is like  Oh my god  I've almost made the biggest fucking mistake in my life  Cheesy show  It really is such a cheese ball  Like if this was American Idol  Americans wouldn't  And Americans are the dumbest motherfuckers when it comes to television  They like some real shit  But they would look at that and go  Come on, stop it  You're bullshitting me 
[00:23:30]  And YouTube  There's been quite a few videos where it's like  Fake, so fake, totally fake  Was it fake?  She said dogs  She's singing  She could have danced all night  But the whole setup is so phony  Of how Simon was ready to hit the button  Like Simon wouldn't be briefed before  Going, look, she's going to do this ballet thing  But the voice she's got is fucking amazing  So wait for her to start singing  And like he's like  Oh boy, here I go 
[00:24:00]  I'm going to hit it  And the ballet wasn't even good  They keep trying to recreate the moment of holy mackerel  Yeah, that's what it is  Holy mackerel  That America's Got Talent is way better than American Idol  Way better than Dancing with the Stars  Because it gets a little of everything  I like the Got Talent shows  I don't watch  You didn't watch America's Got Talent?  Three minutes, I know what's going on  You didn't watch America's Got Talent?  No  That's alright, man  No  It's not too bad  No  I'm just glad you're alive, Anthony 
[00:24:30]  Why, poor Kay?  Well, we had a little cliffhanger last night on the old YouTube  Oh, the YouTube from Real Rock TV  Yes  And everyone's like  Well, thank God  I know the outcome of the cliffhanger  I was trapped  From 11 years ago  When last left  Anthony was trapped  In a mime practice box with no air  Jimmy, did you see the follow-up to the Anthony Vine video?  I did not see the follow-up  On Deuce Chill Theater 
[00:25:00]  Please, can we see the follow-up?  I didn't know there was a follow-up  I was just hoping he died  Well, why don't you explain the original, Jimmy, for everybody  The original is Opie and Anthony are in a little room  And Anthony is behind Opie  Can you make sure people know it's 11 years ago?  It's 11 years ago  Possibly 12  Possibly 12 years ago  Closer to 11  Feels like one  Opie is introducing what is guaranteed to be an action-packed phenomenal show  And yet listing none of the things that would make a show action-packed and good  Right  And pointing to his partner, Anthony, who's in the back 
[00:25:30]  Doing a mime  He's in a clear box pretending to be a mime  And he's talking through the glass  And he says, like, in a couple weeks, they tell me I can get out of the box  Yeah  Well, because he wants to be a mime  No, you know what that was?  That was, um, there was a clear box in the room  And, uh, we decided, what can we do that's gonna be hilarious with this box?  What's in the box?  What could we do?  And then someone thought of it, and they said, forget it, let's not do that  Yeah, that ain't it 
[00:26:00]  What's in the box?  So, well, yeah, we didn't have time to write for a TV show  We were barely, uh, writing for our radio show  Oh, of course  So last we left Anthony, he was still practicing to be a mime at the beginning of the show  And by the end of the show, uh, Jimmy, all hell breaks loose  And you haven't seen this yet  No, I have not  You know  I like to watch here  All right, here we go  Well, there you have it, another WAF Real Rock TV show  Ant, what did you think of the show this week?  Ant  Uh, Ant  Ant 
[00:26:30]  Uh, if you got a comment about the WAF Real Rock TV show, you could, uh, get to us on the web  www.waf.com  Ant  If you're concerned  Ant  Um, on next week's show, we got, uh, an interview with Korn and a live performance from Cake  And much more, but, uh  Ant  Ian, put the camera down, he can't put you  Oh, my God  Oh, my God, what a douchey  Corn and cake  Oh, that sounds delicious  See, but if you were, if you were so concerned, why were you giving the plugs out? 
[00:27:00]  Well, I was, uh, because I, I still thought that you were all right  And then, if you didn't notice the brilliant acting on my part, I was like, you know, I was pumping it up, getting a little more, more nervous as the, uh, the piece went along  Yeah  And by the end, oh, my God, I don't think he's breathing  Ian drops the camera sideways, so you could tell that he dropped the camera  Well, you have to  And then he runs toward the, uh, the glass box to, to help our pal get out of the, uh, the glass box 
[00:27:30]  To be closer to Opie  Probably  How was he going on there?  I don't know, he had some issues  That was, um, oof  Wow, that was really douchey  What do you think, uh, Jimmy? That wasn't as bad as the others  Well, I mean, I, I understood your panic at the end because that wasn't moving  Yes, my, uh, my portrayal of the, um, passed out suffocating guy, I think, was, uh, great  We probably just filmed that on a Saturday morning when we had to do our Saturday show  And you were probably still hungover or drunk, so we'd be like, ah, just get in the box and just don't move 
[00:28:00]  Yeah  We'll make it easy for you  Yeah, probably  Just make it easy  And Jimmy doesn't have much on that one  All right  Well, I'll tell you what  It's kind of, it's, it's, it's just Anthony in the back in a box and you're just plugging stuff  And knocking on the box  And, uh, your panic at the end is actually, uh, really well acted  And the camera goes on an angle and you, what's gonna happen? 
[00:28:30]  Uh, look like the end of, uh, Dawn of the Dead, the new, uh, the remake there  Dawn of the Douche  Dawn of the Douche, yeah  So we get to skate on that one?  We skate?  No, no, I want to skate  We fell through the ice long ago  It was just, to me, it was the conclusion of the first one  I want to see the skateboard one  Uh, we're holding back to skateboarding  That one is  We're holding back to that one  Which new one do we get today?  Did you see the cheese one?  I have not, no  That's why, that's why I'm not, because that's what I'm thinking of 
[00:29:00]  The cheese one is also a follow-up to the, uh, to the video of us breaking the law by going  Through the red light  Even though you officially don't see us going through the red light  I got involved and said, you can't, you can't actually go through the red light  Because then, then we're going to have the authorities knocking down our doors here at AAF  So it stops just before we break the law  But then you learned, if you've been following the saga of our tapes from 11 years ago  That my car was impounded for going through a red light  Going 5 to 10 miles an hour  And you're angry, my favorite part is your angry walk 
[00:29:30]  You get the hat on and your handshake  The angry arms moving  I called you our favorite felon  Like it's a felony to get a red light ticket  Jimmy, before the car got impounded  We decided to have some more fun and shenanigans  More crazy adventures  So we went up to the drive-thru  Who hasn't done a drive-thru prank?  You know, they are amongst the funniest pranks  Oh my god, they're great  I love some of the drive-thru pranks, by the way 
[00:30:00]  That the news is shocked about  I love the shake one  Have you seen the shake one?  I've heard it, what is that when they throw it at the person?  I just throw it back at them  I don't know these people or these workers  So in my world, they are hilarious  If one of my family members were working at a drive-thru  Or got hit by a shake  Or whatever the fuck they throw  Then I'd be probably pissed  But, you know, when you don't know the people  Hilarious  You've never seen the shake one?  Yeah, I have  It's very funny  They pull up to the drive-thru window 
[00:30:30]  And they already have a shake  Oh, they already have one  I see the ones where they've ordered the shake  And then the person gives them the shake  Okay, right  They take it out of the bag  And then throw it right back at them  Wait, because that's the double drive-thru window, right?  Yeah  Is it?  Is it?  Yeah, because they're pulling up  And they are rocking the shakes  Can we see one?  Yes  Yeah, now we have to see one  I have seen one  It was very funny  The logistics of this  Steven S. from Bayshore  Brilliant is not the term that should be used to describe your acting  Oh, I know 
[00:31:00]  I was being sarcastic  Brilliant  I was being a little sarcastic  What's going on with this tractor-trailer-tractor?  Nothing  They show me the same fucking clip  Nothing  Of no action  I don't know how that ends  But there's a woman, apparently, on the back of it  Where usually the trailer gets attached to  And one of the tires are blown out  The thing's going down the road with sparks shooting out of it  And then they cut to some fucking bullshit  The news stinks 
[00:31:30]  Here's the shake video  We'll find out what that's about  Shake, shake, shake  Here you go, Jimmy  I can't really see from my angle  A red pickup truck make its way to the drive-thru window  You'll see him throw this concoction of hot sauce and Gatorade  On to the employee  And now the person behind the wheel will face charges  Police say the incident happened at the subway on Jacktown Hill  In North Huntington Friday night at about 10.30  You can see the red pickup truck pull up to the drive-thru 
[00:32:00]  Order food and even pay for it  But when the clerk was returning his change  You see a red liquid being thrown right into the clerk's eyes  For more than 15 minutes he tried to refocus  While his eyes teared up from the burn of what smelled like hot sauce  We want restaurants that have drive-thru windows  That's a dick that's not keeping the prank fun  What does he got, fucking Tabasco in his shake or whatever?  That's not good  It's basically a Frosty or a soda 
[00:32:30]  You don't jazz it up  It's funny in its own right  Did they show the guy who did it?  What a douche  Hold on, let me go to Kevin and Philly  They got a name for this  They got a name for this  Kevin and Philly  Yo Philly  It's called a fire in the hole  Yeah, fire in the hole  Okay, so fire in the hole  You yell fire in the hole  And then throw  Look at the guy's face as he sees it coming towards him  He knows the jigs up  I'm glad you ordered two drinks 
[00:33:00]  While they're handing you your food after they give you a drink  You fire them right back in their face  I'm sorry that I think this is fun  They're yelling fire in the hole  Video of firebombing or unloading liquid on drive-thru employees is a hit on YouTube  There are hundreds of videos of teens doing it  But North Huntington police say they won't get away with it here  They plan to charge the driver of this red pickup truck with assault, disorderly conduct, and harassment 
[00:33:30]  Be an asshole  What a douche  You're on camera there  They got everything  Yeah, you're kind of stupid  But don't do this, by the way  Because they're catching everybody now  If I could find it  There's a video of this going wrong for the prankster  Where he goes to throw it  And then I guess he doesn't release or something  And the guy just grabs it out of his hand  And just flings it back into this guy's car  Nice  Perfect  There's a  Yeah, now they probably just have a camera  Just fucking grabbing license plates  What do you  Yeah  Not now  Yeah, they can grab license plates 
[00:34:00]  Yeah, they've had that for a while  Yeah, they got that  Alright, back to Real Rock TV  So we did our own drive-thru prank  Wow, much better  Oh, Fire in the Hole failed?  Is that it?  I don't know  I gotta find it  Yeah, fine  It won't get it on the radio in a second  But first, the cheese bit for Jimmy  I have not seen the cheese bit  Is it good, Ant?  I haven't seen it  Oh, you haven't?  No, I like doing these on the air  Okay, yeah, me too  Because they're so douchey  I don't want to be desensitized  From the doucheyness 
[00:34:30]  By previewing them  You gotta go way down there  What did you think of your performance in the box?  Is it on?  It's on, yeah  I like that one  Which one?  My performance in the box  I didn't have to talk or do anything  I just kind of laid there  Okay, here it goes  Alright, here it goes  Hi, may I take your order, please?  Hi, this is going to sound really weird  But I need just a piece of cheese  Can you stop that?  One slice of American cheese, please  See  This is wild, man 
[00:35:00]  Let me tell you  Who does this?  Let me tell you  Who does this right?  Who actually gives away the whole prank  Right from the get-go  This is going to sound weird  But  Huh?  Yeah, yeah, you said this is going to sound weird  You should have just ordered it  Right, why would you just go  Because you're acknowledging it's weird  So the person might go  Alright, he said it's going to sound weird  So why don't I just give him a slice of cheese?  Yeah  You're already preparing them  For something weird  Yeah  Instead of just going  Hey, I need a piece of cheese 
[00:35:30]  You just go  Slice of American cheese  And they go  What the fuck's wrong with you?  Slice of American cheese  So you don't get the reaction of  What are you talking about?  This might sound odd  We're filming something for us  Real rock TV  And we need it to be as douchey as possible  So  Act natural like I am  You'd be the worst candid camera person  You'd walk in and go  Look, you're on candid camera  But behave like you're not  We're going to tell you again  At the end that you are  By the way  A lot of people have been bringing it up  In the last week or so  And I'll read Jeff from Staten Island 
[00:36:00]  This instant feedback  The next jerk off that says  They were so much better  When they were on AF  I will hunt them down  Staple their eyes open  A la Clockwork Orange  And force them to watch  A continuous loop of every episode  Of Real Rock TV  That's why we always laugh  When people go  They were so much better  At Radio Station here  Yeah  You only saw the highlights  You heard the highlights  Over the years  We're even better from  The WNEW days  We rule  All right  Here we go  The cheese bit  If you want to back up 
[00:36:30]  Because we could enjoy it a second time  Yes  Hi, may I take your order please  Hi, this is going to sound really weird  But I need just a piece of cheese  One slice of American cheese please  You see my mom gave me a ham sandwich this morning  And I told her  I always need cheese on my ham sandwich  So I need one slice of American cheese  And I don't need fries with that  Just come around to the second window  Well, how much does a piece of cheese cost?  The way I'm charging you 
[00:37:00]  Yeah, I'll pay for it  What, a quarter?  Everyone's the second window please  Okay, thank you  Thank you very much  Let's see our cheese  Cool  Piece of cheese  Give me half  No  It's free  No  You got enough of that government cheese at home, man  Oh  Mmm  Cheesy  Oh  You can say that again  Oh  With a capital C 
[00:37:30]  Oh  Oh boy  Wow  Jay from Huntington writes  Opie tried to prank the drive-thru  But wound up pranking the audience  That is so  What?  What happened?  The way to do it would have been  What happened?  Just a piece of cheese please  Yeah, I know  And behave as if it's normal  And don't explain why  I know that now  You actually gave the person  A legitimate reason  Yes  To give you a piece of cheese  Yeah  Like she'd have been a cunt 
[00:38:00]  If she didn't give you cheese  Yeah  Maybe that she did  Oh yeah  Yeah, if you don't  That's what I said  At the top  You don't say  This is gonna sound weird  But  That  And then the fact that  You just do the weird thing  You know  With a ham sandwich  And you don't have the cheese  It's like  Alright  That sounds reasonable  I made it  I made it perfectly reasonable  For her to hand over  A slice of cheese  Yes  Yes  You said  Do you have Prince Albert in a can  And by that I mean  The food in the small can  Yes  Do you have that?  Of course  Prince Albert in a can 
[00:38:30]  Was tobacco  I believe  Was it really?  I didn't know that  It was just now  Was it really?  Yeah  Oh my god  I thought it was  Some kind of like  Tuna product  Really?  Yeah  I had no idea  Prince Albert in a can  And they give you food  That would be weird  Yeah  Trying to smoke  Some type of beef product  How about this?  Look I understand  Your refrigerator  Doesn't have feet  But is it running?  By running I mean 
[00:39:00]  Is the compressor  Going on and off  Yes  At a reasonable time  And your temperature  Is set low  People are suggesting  We try the bit  All over again  Today  Oh wow  Yeah  I might have to  Sure  It'll be so good  I might have to  Redo that bit  With my gray hair  Coming in  Dude it would be funny  Really look pathetic  Reenact Real Rock TV  Today  Could be really  Could be fucking hilarious  You know  Like make believe  This is for  For the Opie and Anthony movie  So we'd like  Play it the exact same way 
[00:39:30]  But it's current  Yeah  With better camera work  And stuff  I'll find a wig  That brings my hair  Back to 1996  Wow  Hi  Is this Bob's Bowling Alley  Do you have 16 pound balls  No no  Just the ones  You know  To bowl with  Because those are  The ones I use  Right  You do  Alright  I'll be right down  To bowl  Thank you  How do you walk  With them  Try to get the line in 
[00:40:00]  After you've  Ruined the joke  When the coast is clear  Then it's time  To get the line in  So there you go  Jimmy  And you asked her  For something  That is readily available  In the store  I understand  Like you should have  Asked for  Anything else  A two by four  Exactly  If the prank worked out  We wouldn't be  Replaying it  Eleven years later  This is true  I like to order things  That just don't exist  On the menu  But kind of sound  Like they could  Like  Yeah  Steak  A Tarelli  What? 
[00:40:30]  A Tarelli  What is it?  We don't have  Yeah just make it up  I'm looking at it  Right here on the  Drive through  Not that that's a funny  Oh what a dummy  Oh did that guy  Get nailed  So we're watching  A video of a guy  Doing fire in the hole  He made a  Horrible mistake  The drive through guy  Gives him the first shake  And what's he doing  And there's a second shake  On the shelf  And before the guy  Is handed the second shake  The guy in the car  Throws the first shake back  Allowing the guy 
[00:41:00]  In the drive through window  To retaliate  Because there's still  A shake  Sitting there  He just lightly  Flung it at him  Though he could have  Wailed that thing  Right at him  What a dummy  He's got a drink  Right there  Fire in the hole  And then he kind of  Wings it at him  He should have  Thrown it at his head  Full blast  What a dick  That's pretty good  Alright we're going  To take our first break  By the way  I think I lost Sam  In the Real Rock TV project  He's like  What  Hey man  Why don't we  Why don't we like 
[00:41:30]  You know  Give it a rest  For a little while  I'm busy  I don't think he wants  To go through  Any more tapes  I think it finally  Hit him too  He's douched out  Yeah  So the skateboarding clip  Might be later on this week  Yeah  We're going to slow down  A little bit  Gotta do that one  I think we got about  Five or six more  That are worth putting up there  And then we'll move on  From that bit  I want to see his  Little duck feet  I'm sure  He's not walking down the hall  His feet are awful

[00:43:30]  Now this is what we had written this morning  68 cases confirmed in the US  Officials say they expect someone to die in the US  Well guess what  That very thing just happened  We have our first reported death  Of the swine flu  A 23 month old in Texas has died from the swine flu  There you go  A 23 month old also died from the flu  I'm sleeping  The flu  Swine flu outbreak on the Upper West Side 
[00:44:00]  It's everywhere  But we don't know what to believe  Because the news doesn't tell us the news anymore  They sensationalize everything  So we don't know how high this fear thing should go  It is so sensationalized  Obviously it's a little worse than the flu  We know that much, right?  No, it's not  They're saying it's not even worse than the regular flu  No  It's not worse than the regular flu  They just don't know how to  What?  No  Is it just a branch?  Nothing 
[00:44:30]  There's nothing different from this flu  Than other flus  As a matter of fact  I heard it's fairly mild  As far as flus go  So then why the hell are they hyping the shit out of this?  I don't fucking know  Because of the Mexican deaths  Because they haven't seen the strain of the flu before  Yeah, maybe that's it  Now they're saying Connecticut  Infections, question mark  They want people walking around with masks on  And just freaking out and losing their minds  Yes, Kenny  1010 Winds was reporting this morning 
[00:45:00]  That on average 40,000 people a year die from influenza  In the United States?  Yes, sir  Yeah  So that number's a little higher than we had this morning  So, you know  Is influenza the flu?  Yeah  Yes, that's where the flu comes from  The flu part of influenza  Couldn't call it in  An enza, silly  I have enza  Oh, influenza, duh  Okay  I don't feel well  But I don't feel flu sick  I just feel like I got a sore throat  That's how it starts  My throat's a little scratchy  And when I swallow 
[00:45:30]  It hurts  It hurts a little bit  And then I'm sneezing and coughing up blood  And I had a pus coming out of my ass  And  That would be the Ebola  I have Ebola  Great  Do you know what happened last night?  I was trying to sleep  And my  Because my throat is sore  Your body makes mucus and stuff to coat it  So my  It was like all coated with like a thick mucus  So I kept going  You ever go to spit  And you're trying to suck it out  And it's like a gallon of fucking like gook you spit out  Ugh  But it's only mucus 
[00:46:00]  And you can't get to the end of the goop trail  No  I love that one  The fuck  You start making noises you didn't need to make  Yeah  You guys live here in Manhattan  Yes we do  How do you know that?  How do you know that?  I don't know  I've been stalking you  Have you seen anyone yet wearing a mask?  Yeah we see those people every day  You do?  Yeah before the swine flu outbreak  Do you point and laugh?  Yes  Just yesterday I was in the supermarket  And there was this like elderly couple  And not only were they wearing masks 
[00:46:30]  But they were also wearing latex gloves  And then they robbed the place  Oh Dan you go  And then started sticking their fingers in people's heinies  They were then a rob slash give calling checks  They're these thick fingers in people's heinies  Oh boy  Too wordy  It's alright  You just pluralized the wrong part  I was trying to describe what kind of robbing they like to do  They insult you in the end by sticking a finger in your heinie after they rob you  That's funny  I'm being your wallet off 
[00:47:00]  What do they got a finger in your ass?  Oh it's pretty funny  Yeah oh one more thing we like to do  Bend over  It's how we rob  Right  Let me show you now  Wow I didn't realize that people were walking around with the masks on  Oh they've been doing that for a while  Mostly Asians  And I'm not stereotyping  But 9 out of 10 you'll see  If you see someone with a mask  It's an Asian  And the 1 out of 10 is a doctor  That's just a little late for an operation  This is so sad  I'm on like answers.yahoo.com 
[00:47:30]  Where people can just get like everyday answers for stuff  And the news can do this too right?  Oh absolutely  And like you know someone's asking  What's the difference between swine flu and regular flu  I'm 13 and scared  And like there's just a whole thread of all these kids  That are scared because they don't know what they're supposed to do  I'm 14 I'm scared too  You know just everybody's saying calm down  You know just wash your hands  Avoid crowds and everything  But it really is disgusting  How like you know just the news is scaring the crap out of you  Scaring everybody's scaring the children  That's you know something 
[00:48:00]  That's a prime example  Thanks for pointing that out  It says yeah the difference between swine flu and regular flu  I'm 13 and scared  Exclamation points and all kinds of things behind it  And we are constantly being chastised for doing things under the guise of you know  Well the children  Look what you're doing to the children  What making them laugh from a duty joke or something  This is legitimately scaring children shitless 
[00:48:30]  They're fucking scared  And it's the news doing it  I was walking down the sidewalk yesterday and heard a mommy  For real  Describing the swine flu to her little youngster  Yeah  Because he was scared  I just remember that as you were saying that  Because I passed by like  I'll just get out of my way  I want to go home  I just want to go around coughing in people's faces  But she was  I like parents that are completely honest with their kids  She said it  It's a flu that people are dying from  I was like wow 
[00:49:00]  That people are dying from  Wow  I was like wow  There's just one in the US  That stupid little kid  I thought your job as a parent  Was to kind of let the kid off the hook a little bit  Yeah  Lie to him  Lie to him  You know  Calm him down  They make it sound like it's 28 days later  And you know  The infected are running through the streets  Oh I could only  Well that's what the news really wants  They want that so bad  They want that  Of course they do  I'm so sick  There's got to be one place we could go for the news  Is there any place on the internet? 
[00:49:30]  For real Ann  You go to news sites probably more than I do  Mogulist.com  Slash Anthony Radio  Perfect  Oh Ann  That's just self promoting  Actually Anthony Cumia right?

It's not even cheating  Because you're getting healthy  Right  Exactly  No I was calling because last night  I was flipping through the channels  And just happened to catch one of the promos  For the news last night  And it was  It's only a matter of time  Before swine flu comes to South Florida  What can we do?  We need a stinger today  Nothing 
[00:50:30]  Can't do anything  And my sister is freaking out  She's calling it Captain Trips from the stands  Yes  Yes  It's a good book to stand  Except I hate the way Stephen King named the one guy  The walking dude  Oh  That was so stupid  Well he went by a few different names  So it wasn't that bad  That it was just the walking dude  And what was the old black woman's name?  Mother  It was some  Abigail  You can't see Mother Abigail  Oh god  It's got to  Oh it's got to be some old black woman  With all the wisdom  Shut up  You bring up a good point about Stephen King though 
[00:51:00]  He doesn't name his characters  Sometimes  Some are horrible  The guy can write an 800 page novel  But when it comes to trying to figure out  Cool names for his characters  He kind of falls apart sometimes  Yeah  Lawn mower man  Was it a lawn mower man?  Yep  How about just man man?  He's the guy that goes around  And goes  Yeah  Yeah  Trucks  Was maximum overdrive  Was originally called just trucks  Yeah  Yeah  Bubba  I had been trying to get Stephen King 
[00:51:30]  On this fucking radio show  For two years  And I even said  Look  We won't even talk books  This guy has a nice little  Take on pop culture  Talk about anything  Talk about pop culture  Which Stephen King  Would rule  But we can't get him  I don't know why  No  Dude he's Stephen King  But what an amazingly  Prolific guy he is  Like  The guy writes  Nothing but  600 page books  Like  He doesn't shit dick  On anything  Like they're all long  Yeah  How do you  Like he really fucking  Is a creative dude man 
[00:52:00]  Like he's just  Alright  How you can write that much  No  Amazing  We're doing some swine flu stuff  Swine?  Listen to this  Who are you buddy?  It's Michael  Alright Michael  Your name wasn't on the screen  Mike in New York  What do you got?  Mike  Mike  Yeah it's Mike  Dude  Remember me?  No  I was watching channel 11  Last night  Picks 11  They had somebody  From the CDC  With a map of the United States  Running models  Like this is a  This is a model  For the spread of the swine flu  Oh yeah 
[00:52:30]  And they showed  The  This red dot  You know  A bunch of red dots  Spreading across the map  And they said  You know  According to this model  Swine flu is going to  Wipe out  Half the US population  Come on  Wipe out  They could not possibly say that  It's going to kill  Half the population  Of the United States  They said those words  No way  Someone find that  They said of course  That's just a model  And if you look  You know  And if we intervene  And then we're going to  Show you a different model  And if we intervene  Then it's only going to 
[00:53:00]  You know  Spread this much  And if we put in  The vaccine  Then it's going to  Only spread out this much  But even  Like they just show  These red dots  Spreading across  The United States  It's  It's just  It's panic mongering  Like in  Like in  Any of the movies  Like Outbreak  And stuff  Where they show  The United States  And go  Here's  One scenario  Here's another  Here's another  And it's just  And everything gets  Everything  Covers up  Doubles  And  Double doubles  This swine flu  Is perfect for the media 
[00:53:30]  We don't know what to believe  Sorry  I have no idea  It's just so fucking irresponsible  Of course it is  And they're trying to figure out  Why more people are dying  In Mexico  Than here  And it's because  It's Mexico  It's just  I can't imagine  The health care there  Is very good  You gotta think  Their immune systems  Are a little weaker  To begin with  And you also gotta think  There's not  Doctors readily available  In a lot of places  A lot of these  Off the beaten path places  We've all eaten 
[00:54:00]  Refried beans  Is there any nutritional value  To that stuff?  No  No  Raw sewage flowing  Through the streets  I mean I'll bet people  Are dying from a lot  Of other shit too  Yeah  The answer's made  You know it's  Thank you sir  The news is so competitive now  That it's almost like  The way you can get information  So readily and easily  Makes it more tabloid  Because the pressure  Is so on them  To have you watch them  It's almost like  Years ago  When it was Cronkite  And two others  They'd kind of just tell you 
[00:54:30]  What was happening  Because where the fuck  Else are you gonna go?  Wait for the paper tomorrow  Watch someone else  Go fuck yourself  We gotcha  Yeah  I hear Jon Stewart  Had a fine angle  On the swine flu  Diddy  This is all the stuff  The guys that they're  Listening in the office  Should be taking a peek at  For us today  Nick in Buffalo  How are you?  Did he blame Bush for it?  Probably  How you doing guys?  Alright Nick  I heard on the news  Last evening  While I was driving  That the reason why  This is different  Than a regular flu 
[00:55:00]  Is because it's resistant  To the vaccines  That they have  They have two vaccines  And it's resistant  To both of them  Right now  I guess it's because  The vaccines are old  You know they have to  Update the vaccines  Every year  To make them fight  The different strains  As the strains mutate  Yeah  The two vaccines  That they have now  This swine flu  Is resistant  So that's  I hate to correct  Professor Anthony  But  No that's fine  That's what I heard dude  Alright  Thank you sir  Are they working 
[00:55:30]  On a vaccine?  I guess so  Seems like it's  An easy vaccine  To figure out  Most people get it  It sucks  For a couple of days  I had the fucking flu  Like  What?  Six months ago  Or something  I don't know  And it just sucked  You lay in bed  You feel like shit  Aches and pains  Fever  And then one day  You wake up  And go  Oh that's better  Alright  I was going to say  And then one day  They  Go through that  They replaced  The Guinness keg  And everything's okay 
[00:56:00]  And everything's fine  I will say  Alcohol does help  When you're sick  It actually does  Yeah you have some brandy  You sweat it out  Especially if you have  A little stomach flow  You put some hard liquor  In there  Kills everything  Oh yeah  Kills everything in sight  Nothing better than  A little tummy ache  And then you drink  A little something  And go like  Wow that made it  Really bad  Congress may overturn  Online gambling ban  Good  Let's see  The government  They may believe  They are looking out  For our best interest  But they look at us  As a way of making money 
[00:56:30]  Cha-ching  And they realize  They're losing too much money  By not allowing us  To gamble online  So now they're thinking  About overturning that  So they get their taste  Tax it  So they get their piece  Of the action  So they can tax it  They don't give a shit  If you gamble  Your life savings away  They don't care  They don't care  They just want to make sure  They get their cut  That's all  That's all that's about  You watch  The marijuana thing  That thing is starting to  Cha-choo  Cha-choo  Got some legs  Cha-choo  Cha-choo  Cha-choo  Cha-choo  Cha-choo  Yeah they're gonna 
[00:57:00]  We are going to legalize marijuana  In the next ten years  We like the show  Ah well  It could be our platform  They are gonna legalize marijuana  Especially if they can't  Turn this economy around  Because they're gonna  Start looking for ways  To make money  Turn it around  That's a biggie right  Ah look at this  Let me read  Your mouth to God's ears  Opie  The marijuana thing  A lot of people  Love their pot  Love their pot  And it's still  You know 
[00:57:30]  Illegal  Nah they're gonna  Figure it out  They're gonna  Like we said  They're doing the  Medical marijuana  So they're kind of like  Experimenting  Seeing you know  What kind of effect  That's having  In society and stuff  Because we learned from  Like Doug Benson  And a few other people  That you have a little  Chronic headache  You get the  You get some chronic  The medical marijuana  Right  How uh  How do you think  People would receive  Going to a store  And buying pot  As a side  As opposed to  Going to a friend 
[00:58:00]  And buying pot  Like  Especially at the beginning  Let's say they legalize weed  Some places open up  That could be the problem  You could buy weed  People might go like  You know something  Yeah I'd like to go in there  And buy that  But fuck I don't know  They're watching me  Or some other shit  And my buddy's got  Some great weed  Why don't I just get that  I bet you that's what  They're trying to figure out  Because if they legalize it  In a way  Why wouldn't you still  Be buying it from  Your friend's friend  Yeah  You know what I mean  It's easier  But can I say  The thrill of buying  The thrill of buying it legally 
[00:58:30]  People will love  To buy pot legally  And they'll love to be able  To just go get  I want to go get some pot  Can I have some marijuana  You'll be in the store  Yeah  Looking around at everybody  Pot  I'm buying some pot  And you can choose  From the different types you want  Like I think that  Yeah  Yeah I think people  Would do it legally  And weed is one of those things  That like  Picture this also  You buy some pot  You smoke it  I'm so sorry  And then you go  This pot sucks  Uh huh 
[00:59:00]  Like when you buy  Jack Daniels or something  You know every fucking bottle  Is going to get you fucked up  That's right  Doesn't matter  You don't get a bottle of Jack  Pour out some shots  And go  This Jack sucks  There's a ruined relationship  In every bottle  A black eye  In every bottle  You make a good point  You ever wonder how  Like your favorite product  Tastes exactly the same  Amazing  Every fucking time you buy it  You gotta watch how it's made  Yeah I know  It's amazing  The machinery  But it's like  They don't fuck up the formula  Slightly  I know  Where all of a sudden  You get your ketchup  Or whatever it is 
[00:59:30]  And you're like  Wow this one tastes  A little different  It never tastes different  Ever  They're gonna need  Some kind of pot  Quality control  Right  And uh  But you know  Maybe they'll get that  But I can't see that  Happening immediately  Look it's been said  A million times  But  Fucking alcohol  Is way worse than marijuana  And I can't believe  As a society  We just make believe  That's not true  That that statement  Is not true  I think we're working  It is amazing to me  We're working off  An archaic  Um  Kind of belief 
[01:00:00]  In what weed is  And was  You know  Years ago  You watch  Reefer Madness  Dude  That's insanity  I read  I wish I had more facts  So I'm not sure  If this is entirely correct  Then you fit in perfectly  Exactly  But I do remember  This isn't the facts  And knowledge show  I was watching something  And those  All those  You know  All those old  Reefer Madness movies  And stuff like that  It was a big smear campaign  And it was financed  By a guy  Who ran a paper business  And he was trying  To smear marijuana  Because he was afraid 
[01:00:30]  Because hemp  Was like more  It was easier to produce  It yielded more  Paper or whatever  So he just  You know  Launched this huge  Smear campaign  Against marijuana  Fucking brilliant  On his part  Yeah  Because it was  You know  It was in his  Monetary  Right  You know  Best interest  Yeah  And the stigma  Is still there  Like there's this  Stigma  With pot  That it's  A drug  It's  You know  Bad for you  It makes you do  Fucked up things  And it shouldn't  Be legalized  Because  What if the children  You regulate it 
[01:01:00]  You tax the shit  Out of it  Oh man  Imagine what  They would tax  Imagine what  The tax  On pot  Would be  How much  You think  What are cigarettes  Up to  Ten bucks  A pack  We saw  I don't know  What the tax  Is but  Ten dollars  Most of that  Is taxes  Yeah  Oh yeah  Some filthy  Animal  Hey  It would be amazing  What they would  What they would  Charge tax  On weed  Because I think  A pack of  Joints  Would be  A lot more  Than a pack  Of cigarettes  And the tax  On it  Would be  Fucking crazy 
[01:01:30]  Only difference  Is though  It's considered  Medical marijuana  Where cigarettes  Have no redeeming  Medical value  Let's say  I'm talking  Legalization  A pot  For recreational  Use  Not even  Medical anymore  Oh no  They're only doing  The medical thing  To kind of  Experiment  They're going to  Just have full out  You can buy  Marijuana  Like you  Buy a six pack  On a Friday  After  Exactly  That's what I'm  Talking about  They're not  Even going to  Fuck around  With why  They're legalizing  They're like  Oh fuck  People enjoy this  We get a little  Taste of the action  So yeah 
[01:02:00]  Go buy your  Marijuana  After a long  Week of work  Don't you know  People give  Bad examples  Like yeah  People are going  To be running  Around buying  Pot like  That's corn  Chips  What  Hey  Hold that thought  Because I don't  Want to lose  Matt's great  Line here  Matt on Long Island  It was talking  About having the flu  The swine flu  Is happening  These days  Matt what do you  Got  Yeah usually  When Anthony  Gets sick  Is because  He has the  Wine flu  Oh  The wine flu  I just got a  Little touch  Of the wine  Flu yesterday  Are you  Yeah a little  Touch  Came down 
[01:02:30]  With a little  About of the  Wine flu  If we could  Find it  Bill Hicks  Talking about  How much  More dangerous  Alcohol is  Over pot  Nice little  Clip to play  Today if we  Could find it  In the big  Master  Computer  So I think  The marijuana  Thing is coming  Yeah  I think so too  Especially in this  Horrid economy  Oh my god  Would they  Just to rake in  The money  And balance the  Budget  Legalize pot  What the fuck  Frank the truck  I don't even need  To go to his call  He goes  How do they 
[01:03:00]  Drug test  If they  Legalize pot  If pot's in  Your system  If it's legal  That you're  Not breaking  Any law  They'll change  All the laws  No I think  You could still  Drug test  Sure  For job  Related things  Like if they  Don't want you  Smoking pot  But if it's  Legal  Like  Well what about  Drinking  I mean  They don't test  You for drinking  No but  If you come to  Work drunk  Come to work  Drunk  A few  Too many times  They might fire  You  Interesting  Yeah I guess  They wouldn't  Be testing that 
[01:03:30]  No  But do certain  Jobs could have  The requirement  That even though  It is a legal  Product  It's still a  Mood altering  Thing  And they don't  Want you  Taking it  Like they  Could still  Say we don't  Want cops  Smoking pot  Or fire  They could  Still say  That  Yeah  I got one  For Danny  Tom in Baltimore  Has a problem  With Danny's  Facts  Tom  Hey  How you guys  Doing  Good  Tommy  Hey  So Danny's  Worried about  Getting his  Facts right  He's quoting  Brian the  Dog  Asks  Family Guy  Did you get  Your facts  From Family Guy  Yeah but then 
[01:04:00]  But then you get  But then you do  Some research  And it's the truth  And we're bitching  And we're bitching  About the media  Not telling us  What's going on  We're getting our  Facts from Family Guy  From the dog  On Family Guy  That's right  Yeah  Danny is that why  You prefaced it with  I'm not sure if this is right  Because I got it from a cartoon  I didn't realize where  I just knew I heard it  So  Apparently Acme  Was making these  Anvils that would  Fall off a cliff  Oh Tom that's great  Do we have the song  All right let's hear this  Now everybody gather round 
[01:04:30]  And listen if you would  When I tell you  Every person needs  A way of feeling good  Every kitty needs  A ball of string  And every dog a stick  But all you need  Is a bag of weed  To really get a kick  One  Two  Three  Four  Five  Six  Seven  Eight  A bag of weed  A bag of weed  Oh everything is better  With a bag of weed  It's the only help  As you'll ever need 
[01:05:00]  Because everything is better  With a bag of weed  There you go  You're all getting it now  When Texas people  Want to feel good  They go assault a queer  When city people  Need a thrill  They rent the rocketeer  When Michael Jackson  Needs a rush  He humps a guy like me  But all we need  Is a bag of weed  To keep us worried  Three  One  Two  Three  Ho  A bag of weed  A bag of weed  Oh everything is better  With a bag of weed  Oh you don't need nothing  You don't need speed  Because everything is better  With a bag of weed  Have a go Brian 
[01:05:30]  As Mr. H.L. Mencken said  The common man's a fool  And just like Helen Keller said  Boop boogie people boo  But try and use your heads  And don't buy into all the fear  Because all we need  Is a bag of weed  To make us want to cheer  And one  Two  A bag of weed  A bag of weed  Oh everything is better  With a bag of weed  You can try and fight  But we're all agreed  Because everything is better  With a bag of weed  One  Two  Three  Four  Five  Six  Seven  Hey  And a one  Two  Three  Four  And a five  And a six 
[01:06:00]  And a seven  Oh  A bag of weed  A bag of weed  That fucking family guy  That's funny  The musical productions are amazing  They're just the quality of the sound  I saw them live at Radio City  Was that good?  Because we kind of trashed that going on  Who would want to see that?  It was really cool  It was  It was actually really cool  Just to watch them do these songs live 
[01:06:30]  With like you know a 50-60 piece orchestra behind  I would check that out  It was crazy  Yeah we laughed at it  Like that's silly  I want to watch the cartoon  I mean they did touch on it  In that episode about pot being illegal  But I mean it stems from real things  I mean this guy Hurst  He had all these timber companies  And it was based on real facts  Just because you get  A fact from a cartoon  Take your little beanie  There's no need to defend it  It was funny  Let the tire run over your foot  You're a fool  Let the school bus run over your foot  It's okay  You'll be alright 
[01:07:00]  You're a yutz  After hearing that song  And how clever it is  And how creative it is  And it's just amazing  That that family guy  Was taking off our TVs  I mean they're way past that now  But how do you say  Ah this show isn't good  Was it ratings it didn't do well  Probably  But they kept moving it around  Different times  And different days  So no one ever knew when it was on  But it's obvious that it was a monster man  You know you try to figure out  How to make it work  How long was it off?  I don't know  A year or two right?  It was off like two years 
[01:07:30]  Yeah it was gone  And the DVD sales brought it back  Because they were just through the roof  It was so gone  I mean Seth had to go  Holy shit  I gotta get all these people back  Because they were way gone  On to other projects  Alright  Oh here we go  Let's say hi to Jason in Ohio  Morning boys  Welcome aboard  Hey man  Crosby stills dashing young  Oh  My father-in-law  He's a microphone  We were asking him about this whole swine flu thing 
[01:08:00]  And he basically said  It's not going to be a real big deal  The problem is with the media going crazy  When the actual real next pandemic breaks out  People are going to  You know they're basically going to shrug it off  And say oh it's just the media again  And then we're all going to be really screwed  Yeah that's true  Well  Yeah  I can believe that  The old cry wolf  Yeah  If you got  If you watched the Fox News yesterday  Every story was about the swine flu  And then Bill O'Reilly was talking about  How the media was going crazy  And watching the news this morning  They barely even mentioned the swine flu 
[01:08:30]  Everything was about Obama's first 100 days  Look whatever the Google trend is  The local news is all over that  Because that's what our people focus  You know the people are focusing on that  So they're like  Alright give me 20 swine flu stories today  Well that's what keeps people watching TV I guess  My wife  Yeah but it's the news  I mean there should be different  You know what I mean  The government should step in and go  Look if you want to call yourself the fucking news  You can't you know  You can't scare the shit out of everybody  And if you want the content freedoms that the news gets  Right  If you do call it the fucking news 
[01:09:00]  I think then you should be able to  Say what you want  You could call it the fucking news  And you go  Okay these guys are going to sensationalize  And they're going to throw a little fear at me  But I watch the news  Welcome to the fucking news  Force them to call themselves the fucking news  Picks 11  That's a great  Morning fucking news  Welcome to the fucking news  And they just give you all bullshit  But then they're allowed to  Fox 5 fucking news  Good day New York fucking news  Yeah swine flu killed someone  Who gives a shit?  Who cares? 
[01:09:30]  Wolf Blitzer in the fucking situation room  Yeah  Oh I'm sure he's got a situation on his hands  With his swine flu  Oh there's pigs on the screen  And fucking kids  I've been blowing off the Wolf Blitzer lately  Oh yeah  Wolf's been going bullshit with this one  I'm going to watch the wolf  And I'm going to see what's going on  With the situation room today  Alright  The US will never legalize pot  Pharmaceutical companies are pumping this up  To make money  Has info on marijuana prohibition  Truck drivers have to take random alcohol tests 
[01:10:00]  Really?  Is that possible?  Do that  Darren  It's called a fucking  Dewey test  Random alcohol test  Heel to toe please on this line  No idiots  That's just a roadblock  That's not a random  That's for everybody  What do you got on this Darren?  Yeah  Drivers  They have random  Just like random drug tests  They call you in  Tell you  Hey you got to go down  Take a fist test  And well 
[01:10:30]  While you're at it  Take a breathalyzer  That's something we have to do all the time  To see if you're drinking at the time  Right  See that makes sense  But if you smoked weed  Like you know  Three days before  And you're on vacation  Or something  You talk  Don't let me explain  That's okay  You said three days  Pot stays in your system  For over 30 days  Yeah but that's a rumor  So there's a way to get pot out of your system  If you do  Yeah  You drink  Pear cramp  No  No  That's silly 
[01:11:00]  That's a myth  It doesn't though  I read that  Let's say you're on vacation  Let's say you're on vacation  Alright  And you smoke some weed on vacation  And then you come back to work  You're fine  You haven't been smoking weed  But if you take a test  It's going to show positive  And then you're fucked for your job  Well you got time to drink  About three full gallon of water  Alright  Thank you Darren  I said get a hold of yourself 
[01:11:30]  I think I got marijuana in my system  From following that dude  That was smoking pot openly  Down Columbus Avenue the other day  A lot of people have used that excuse  When they take drug tests  But do I have pot in my system  Because when I was smelling that herb  Even though I don't smoke pot  I haven't since  Wow  Early 90s  And that is a fact by the way  Yeah I don't think  I want to go  I want to jump all in soon  But  I don't think  But I was  Because of the smell  I was taking those deep breaths  Taking it in  Did I get a little action you think  Nah I doubt it  I didn't get any pot action 
[01:12:00]  Nah  Let's say hi to Dan  On Long Island  Hello Dan  What's going on boys  Hey Ope  I love how you're bashing Danny  From getting his information  From a cartoon dog  When you get yours from  Play Smash  We do get our info  In the darndest places  Don't we  Oh boy  I never said that I  I never said that I  I read that in the New York Times  It happens 
[01:12:30]  But I do  You're going to do it on this show  I read the Times as well  Sort of  I read the first paragraph  Of every story  This is like a  Prohibition thing though  You know they tried  With booze  And it didn't work  I mean for weed  It's just  People that want to smoke pot  Are smoking pot  I don't think anyone  Is not smoking pot  Because of the law  I honestly don't think  There's anyone out there  That is saying  I'd love to smoke pot  But it's illegal

It happens all over too  How are you gonna  Take care of it though  And prevent it?  Um  You're gonna have to  Do tests on the donkeys  I guess 
[01:15:00]  But what will you have to  Wear to prevent yourself  From getting it?  Um  I don't know  Maybe a mask or something?

Man is a nice turn  As for how legal all this is  Citizens arrests are allowed  In Ohio and Kentucky  For felonies and some misdemeanors  Although the person making  The citizens arrest  Risks lawsuits or possible  Criminal charges of their own  If they're wrong about the person 
[02:19:00]  They're accusing  Yeah  Oh this is going to end badly  One of these people will be dead  Dead  Can't wait to see those  Huh?  Another great reason to go to Cincinnati  Yeah  Ah that's Cincinnati  In fact I have a vacation coming up  And we've been looking at some hotels there  In downtown Cincinnati  Yeah  Yeah  I see those commercials  I could just somehow stay right down there  That dirty river  There  You know  That's not even  That odd  Because  You see the commercials

[02:20:00]  And they're looking at a sunset  By some mountains  And it's like  Come to fucking South Carolina  It's funny when there are  Tourists in some place like that  Like you're going to do  Like a stand up gig  In like St. Louis  And there's a couple there  Oh we're just  Yeah we're vacationing  Vacation here?  Always wanted to see the Arch  There you go  You saw it  Now watch  What's the second thing  People do  On vacation in St. Louis  After the Arch  Maybe a Cardinals game?  Maybe  You go to a tour  You can't catch Budweiser 
[02:20:30]  Budweiser  Anheuser-Busch  And somebody goes  You know they have more bars  Per person  In this  You know how many cities  Claim that by the way?  Yeah  This city has more bars  Per person  Than any other city  We're very proud of the Arch here  And you'll never find better people  Than here in our fair  Shut it  You're lying  You always have some sort of  Fucked up sandwich  That you just have to get  They put the fries  Right on the sandwich  Then they put a fried egg on it  And if you eat the whole thing 
[02:21:00]  You get a refrigerator magnet  It's great  You haven't been down there?  Oh well  You gotta go  You haven't visited  This shithole  Until you get home  You ever had a horseshoe?  That's what they asked me  In Springfield, Illinois  You ever had a horseshoe?  No  I haven't  You gotta get one  Do I?  What is it?  Well it's a horseshoe shaped bun  And they take three hamburger patties  And they put it on there  And then they add this  And everything  Oh it has like a fried egg 
[02:21:30]  And shit on top  Yeah  You gotta have one  No I don't  I've had a hamburger  With french fries  I don't need three of them  All in the same bun  Shaped like a horseshoe  You really don't have anything special here ma'am  I'm sorry  Horshoe  You definitely have some funky looking bread  But other than that  Yeah I'll give you the bread  You have a number two at McDonald's  Do that and rub Abe Lincoln's nose  That's what they tell you to do in Springfield, Illinois  They have a statue  His forehead or something  Oh the life I lead 
[02:22:00]  Yeah  Jersey Matt from Bayonne  The second thing you do in St. Louis is leave  Good idea  Hey man they're on fire today  Why don't we go up in the arch by the way  What?  Yes I did it  It's one of the scariest things I've ever done  Why is it scary?  It is right  Because it was built  You know that time  Because the elevator goes sideways  And then upside down  It's basically it  It's a cartoon elevator  Any of that shit that was built during that time  Where we thought we were going to colonize the moon 
[02:22:30]  I don't know if you've ever been to like Seattle  The future  Yeah I've been to space travel  Yeah like they're basically all that shit that they built during the World's Fair  And this is a monorail  And that looks like a big fucking toaster  Hooked up to another one  Yeah  Basically when you go up into the arch  You get in these little  Remember that little egg that Robin Williams was in in Mork?  Yeah  It looks like that  And you just slowly go up like this  And as it stops  It sort of swings from side to side  Are you shitting me?  Is that how you get up in that thing?  And then you get up there  And to look out the windows  Is you literally have to lay down 
[02:23:00]  On your stomach  And the arch gives  Like 30 feet or something  In both directions  No  Because it's  You know it's designed that way  Wow  Dude it's one of the scariest things I've ever been up to  You went up there  And you could feel the thing moving  I literally  I looked out the window  I said okay I'm leaving  It's like 600 feet right?  I don't know  I don't know  Wow that's fucked up  I didn't realize how they did that  Are the eggs inside or outside?  It's inside  Inside  It's  It's just  The big story though 
[02:23:30]  Is some idiot  Tried to land on it  On a  There you go  Dude I always wondered  How they got the elevator  To work  And it's kind of on a little  Round thing  But it's  That's all internal  The eggs  And then you get out?  The whole technology reeks of like 1963  They play like a Kennedy speech  And now it's on to Chicago  And let's win there  Yeah  How the fuck do they build this thing?  It's their big tourist attraction  Well if I'm making fun of it 
[02:24:00]  I went to on it by myself  The saddest thing I ever did was  I went to the Mall of America  In Minnesota  Ugh  And I rode the roller coaster  What kind of trash did you see there?  I rode the roller coaster  In the mall by myself  Just to do it  Just to explore that level of loneliness  Did you even make it seem like  You were having fun?  Did you go like  Whoa  Whoa  Whee  Whoa  What did you  Or just sit there  Just like  I'm lonely  No it was just sort of like  I don't know  Maybe I'll get a bit out of this  This is just so pathetic  And I got nothing out of it 
[02:24:30]  It was just sad  That I walked by  1500 places where they sell shirts  The saddest thing is  That's where their stadium  When the North Stars used to play  Is it really?  Yeah and they lost their team  Not even because people didn't support it  Just because the guy wanted to leave  It's like  Yeah this place sucks  Let's make it into a mall  No none of that  The biggest mall  Yes  In all the country  And people from like  The Dakotas  Iowa  That's like a day trip  Let's go to the mall  One of the worst examples  Of futuristic  Or what they thought 
[02:25:00]  Was going to look futuristic  Was the goddamn  TWA terminal at Kennedy  That thing looked like  Something out of  Planet of the Apes  Yeah  It just looked stupid  The Wrath of Khan  Big  Yeah yeah  The Wrath of Khan  Look at that thing  It's so stupid looking  That should be the fortress  For those Cincinnati superheroes  Yeah  Should be checking people's bags  I'm looking at stuff like that  And go  That must have been a pain  In the ass to build  What happened to just building  Like squares and rectangles  You know how the fuck 
[02:25:30]  Do you build that  They got into this futuristic thing  Of what they  Or their vision  Of what they thought  The future was going to be  And the thing looked dated  In like  The Jetsons  Five years  Yeah  The Jetsons  And five years later  It just looked like  Oh my god  Does that look like  A passe  Why don't we take a break  Because we got  Tommy Shaw standing there  And Colin Quinn  Standing there  I don't know if he is  That's just for radio  I don't even know  If Tommy Shaw  Every day I ask  The same question  I don't know  I'm like  You're sitting here with me  I have no idea  Just what you do on the radio 
[02:26:00]  Standing by  And then  Then you run down the hall  And go are they here  And Steve goes no  Alright we'll do something else  When we get back  Bill Burr's at Caroline's  All weekend  Starting what  Tomorrow night Bill  Yep  Thursday through Sunday  The tickets gotta be rocking  They gotta be right  You don't even have to be here  Started charging Yankee prices  2,500 down near the stage  You see what they did  They lowered those prices  Because everyone's like  Why all the empty seats  Stadium's empty  Yeah  The Yankee organization  Went  Maybe we should drop  Some of the  By 40%  Have you seen those seats though 
[02:26:30]  They look literally  Like a first class seat  On an airplane  An airplane really  I don't know  They look nice and cushy  There Jimmy  You gotta think  The animals that go  To the Yankees games  The Yankee games  Want to throw stuff  On people that sit  In those seats  Like fuck those assholes  Yeah like a bunch of  Fucking businessmen  Like what kind of  Fucking $2,500 seats  For an Indians game  What kind of  Asshole does that  It's amazing  It's sad  It's sad  Yeah it is  Fuck that  What kind of a statement  Is this  When there's 
[02:27:00]  Hardworking people  Just trying to get  Cheez-Its  But they're gonna charge  $2,500  Get your Bill Burr tickets  I think they're open  Right now  212-757  4100 for Caroline's  Dr. Michio Kaku  I think we finally  Fixed this thing  Oh good  So I think now  It has all the stuff  We want in this promo  I believe  We'll listen together  Opie and Anthony  Jim Norton  Bill Burr  And Danny on the beatbox  3, 2, 1  This is theoretical physicist  Dr. Michio Kaku 
[02:27:30]  And you are  What are you are  Henry C. Matt  Professor of theoretical physics  Is the official title  This is Opie and Anthony  And this is Dr. Kaku  On the Opie and Anthony show  What is antimatter?  100% efficiency  Now a hydrogen bomb  Is 1% efficient  I know because  My friends  Work on this  My friends drink  What about  Cell phones?  What are they gonna become?  Many futurists believe  That the future  Will look like a Disney movie  For example  The magic mirror  You go up to it 
[02:28:00]  And say  Mirror, mirror  On the wall  And it answers  Any question  You want  That's how he has to talk to us  That's what we were joking about  Do you believe in ghosts?  Many people believe  That ghosts lived  In a higher dimension  If you are looking down  On a tabletop  And there are  Two dimensional people  Living on a tabletop  Like Cookie  Cookie Man  You would have the power  Of a ghost  I love  Cookie Man  Cookie Man  Cookie Man  Any questions?  How dumb do you think  We really are? 
[02:28:30]  Let's go back to high school  If this was a lunch table  Would you sit with us?  I think twice  This is  Theoretical physicist  Michio Kaku  And even I  Can't explain  How bad  This show is  This house is shaking  Don't bother knocking  Whoa  You can't stop knocking  With doors are open  No need to lock it  Whoa  You can't stop knocking  The road is lonely 
[02:29:00]  You're checking out  The Opie and Anthony show  Can't Stop Rocking  That's Tommy Shaw  With Kevin Cronin  That's the new single  Right  Tommy  That's it  We were just sitting here  We got Tommy Shaw  From Sticks in studio  Very very cool  And we were talking  Music and bands  And Freebird  Freebird  Leonard Skinner  Getting back together  In the late 80's  That's the dude  That got it done  Right there  That's Charlie Bruss  Got it done  He got it  He got her done  Get her done  Get her done  What's up Tommy

[02:30:00]  Oh perfect  Okay good  You know  God bless them  Good luck  With the next  You're much more  You're nicer than I am  Because someone  Who knows  JimNorton.com  And every day  I just hope  They wake up  Finding they have cancer  I hate that  You know  With that huge laugh  From TommyShaw  It also has to be  Brought to the table  I was so annoyed at this  And the fans  Are keeping track  On the websites  And stuff  TommyShaw  Recognized  Jim Norton  Jim Norton  Watched the DVD  On the bus  Funny guy 
[02:30:30]  Yeah that's what people do  They just enjoy themselves  On the bus  And they watch  It would be awful  He said none of us  Could sleep  We put the DVD on  And we all just  Passed out  The bitterness  Was just  Just fantastic  Yeah it is  You know what  What were you  Ten when you  Were in  Sticks  I just turned  22  Did you  Really  That was it  That was it  Yeah because  I was going to say  You look pretty much  The same  You know what helps 
[02:31:00]  You know  The hair  You didn't have to go  With the bandana thing  Or anything like that  You're one of the lucky  The lucky few  That actually kept the hair  I'm telling you  It wasn't for not  Worrying about it  You know  We always used to joke  You know  Well by the time  We're 50  It's going to be  The hat to her  And I still reserve  The right to put  The headband  And the bandana  Back on  It's like  Fuck it  You know  I'm still going to  I'm still going to  Show up and play  I got a funny looking  Head though  It's going to be 
[02:31:30]  Really shitty  Is it misshapen  Yeah  You know  It's like  Remember that cartoon  Henry  When you're looking  It's like the big thing  In the back  And a big forehead  And it's just going to  Be awful  I'm going to show up  Anyway  I go  There's not  Tell me  I'll look at  The fucking head  On that  You play with  A few people  Over the years too  Like  You know  We were talking  About Ted Nugent  Earlier  You played with him  Yes  And  We've had him  On the show 
[02:32:00]  A few times  Quite a  Unique personality  On old Ted  I love Ted Nugent  You know  I just  He and I  We have a lot of  Differences about us  But when it comes down  Just to the core values  We're  You know  We're brothers  Yeah  Yeah  Politically  You get into like  Because I  Believe me  Don't get me wrong  I'm completely on  Ted Nugent's side  With like  Most of his  Political stance  So  Yeah  You know  I've always been  Kind of a  You know  I've never liked to  Alienate any of our audience  You know  I was like 
[02:32:30]  Good answer  Everybody come  See the show  Yeah  And have you  You know  It's like  Personal beliefs  Religious beliefs  And all that sort of stuff  That's a personal thing  And I'm not going to argue  Anybody's right  To believe that stuff  So  You know  Yeah  You get more fans  If you just don't talk politics  Yeah  I truly believe that  I truly believe that  I truly believe that  Then you know  If you're not going to work with people  Because of that  You're limiting  You know  I certainly are  To do this  Nothing better than guys  That get up on stage  And go  Yeah man  You know 
[02:33:00]  The government man  And you're like  Guys play your fucking  Play your song  Yeah really  That's what it's  Trying to tell me  What I should be doing  And what I should be voting for  That's like when  Eddie Vedder came out  He put George Bush's head  On a stick  It's like  What the hell is that  Can you just play  Play even flow and shut up  And think about it  Even in our band  You know  We don't  It's like if somebody  You know  The longer you're out on the road  And you start introducing songs  The next thing you know  You're telling a story  The other night  We're playing somewhere  And I'm introducing 
[02:33:30]  Some song  And the music starts coming up  It's like the fucking  Academy Awards  Like you're going too long  I'm like  What?  I'm in the band  Don't  They like shushed me on stage  You had cut off  It was fooling yourself  You know  I was getting ready  All of a sudden  The synth music's coming up  Like how long have I been talking?  Is this like what you pictured though  When you said you're like 22 years old  And you're in a huge band  And everything  Is this kind of what you pictured  Getting older and still playing 
[02:34:00]  Would be like?  No I'm 55  I thought 55 was  You're 55?  Yeah  What the fuck is going on  With these guys lately?  We had Maury Povich in  He's 70  He looked like he was maybe 62  Tops  You don't look 55 there Tommy  Well thanks  I thank my mother  She's got the good genes  Do you live a healthy life  Or do you like do the complete opposite  And just like  All of a sudden  Here you are healthy  I  Complete debauchery  Until about 20 years ago 
[02:34:30]  Oh really?  They figured it out  Yeah  The whole behind the music  Kind of thing  Yeah the whole behind the music thing  You know  I almost  I screwed my hand up  Putting it through a window  In the  What was that?  83  You know  Five tendons severed  Wow  And all this shit  And I just took that  You know  They said  Well you've got to take a month off  Right in the middle of the Roboto tour  And I was like  Shit  I'm going to party now  You know  None of that stuff  You didn't want to play Mr. Roboto? 
[02:35:00]  Then  I couldn't  You know  I couldn't anymore  You know  That's why he put his hand through the window  That's kind of what I was getting at  I think it was the Quaaludes  Did you like playing Mr. Roboto?  I didn't mind playing it  It was doing the acting part of it  Because I  You know  I just  I  I wanted to just play  Right  Was that more Dennis' push  To make it more of a musical theater type of thing  As you guys  Performing live?  Well what that was  Was just kind of the  The really pinnacle of us 
[02:35:30]  Starting to go our different ways  And  He created this great thing  And the worst thing about it  Was he had a band  Who didn't really feel like doing it  So  You know  When you're doing something like that  It really requires everybody pulling in the same direction  So that  That would have probably been better  If he had  Gone on  And just let it himself  And had  All of his own people doing it  So  You know  It was  But  So you guys were just sort of staring at him  As he would go  Okay  In five  Six  Seven  Eight  Dude 
[02:36:00]  I just want to play my guitar here  No  You know  We were always a band  We would get behind something  Even if  If it was  If we weren't  A hundred  If  If it was something  That was  Something that was good  But  At that point  We'd been on  We'd been traveling on the road  For almost eight years  And  And if we had been a little older  And more mature  We would have gone  Look  We need to take a break  Let's go  We can't miss each other  If we don't ever leave  You know  So we'd been  It was like stuck in a room  With each other for eight years  But  You know  That's all  That's all hindsight  And 
[02:36:30]  The nice thing about it is  Regardless of how we felt  With all that  I still have people coming up to me  And say  You guys were my first concert  The Mr. Roboto tour  And I love you guys  So  Sure  I'm not going to argue with that  What was  I just want to ask  Because we're on Dennis DeYoung  Did he really have a problem with light  Like we saw on the TV  What was it  Behind the music  Or whatever  I don't know  You know  We really haven't worked together  Since 1997  And I look at that  As like  That's the time  Between you starting the first grade  And now you're starting college 
[02:37:00]  Yeah  You know  I don't even know  Where I'm going to be next week  So  Some of this stuff is  You know  I start forgetting about  About  Yeah like what happened  And  Things like that  And plus  You know  That's 12 years ago  You know  Now  Before I was so rudely interrupted  When I asked you earlier  Um  Jimmy  That's okay  Did you  Did you picture  Like this  At being 55  And still playing  What  What were your impressions  Early on  Of what you would be doing now 
[02:37:30]  And  As opposed to  What you are doing now  I don't know  That I thought that far ahead  Really  But I just  When I would see people  55 years old  They just seemed  Kind of crusty  And you know  And  And  They just seemed like  Grown ups  And  That was  You know  I'd probably be dead  Before  I got to that point  So I wasn't really prepared  For this  And it's really  Now that I'm here  It's like  Well  I've had a lot more experience  But I'm still  Kind of dressing the same  And  Getting up and doing the same job  So that  I think that's probably 
[02:38:00]  What's so  Probably what gives me  Such a  Not realistic view  Of  The world  Is because I still do  The same thing  That I've always done  Yeah  I haven't had to really  Adapt it too much  And has it changed  Your music though  Just  Kind of  Living life  You know  You always write  What you know  You write  What you're going through  And that sort of thing  And I practice  More than I used to  Really  Yeah  I never used to practice  You know  Because I was  You know  I was having a lot of  Other things to do  I gotta jump in for a second 
[02:38:30]  We got a big star  On the line  That wants to say  Hi to Tommy Shaw  For real  Jay Moore  Jay  Hi everybody  We got  Tommy Shaw  Hi Jay  I know  I'm such a huge  Tommy Shaw fan  I love sticks  But we all know  The real rock  Mind behind the band  Sticks  And that's that man  Sitting there right there  Hi Tommy Shaw  Good morning  Good morning  I just want to say  I think it's really great  That you're going to be with me  At the Wilbur Theater 
[02:39:00]  In Boston this Saturday  Sweet  Jesus  That is the cheesiest plug  I've ever heard  But you gotta  You gotta tip your cap  To fucking Jay  Anyone that's going to be  In Minneapolis this weekend  Man  Go see Jay Moore  No  I said not Minneapolis  Boston  Oh sorry  Oh  You're right  You guys are brutal  Jimmy I help you  You help me  Fair enough  Wilbur Theater this Saturday  Jay Moore  You gotta tell  Ticket for the Wilbur Theater  You don't want  Bill Blumenreich  To have anything  Over your head 
[02:39:30]  Jeez Louise  God damn  He shows you what I know  Come on  Get David Spade  Out of there  Thank you for the call  That was a plug  Jay's wanted to call  He just called  To plug  His Wilbur Theater  And you know  And he's telling me  I'm going to be there  I'm going  Yeah okay  I'm there  I don't know  That would be funny  Get off when they tell me to  A bunch of like  Sticks and damn Yankees fans  Believed it  And he showed up  And then just threw  Fucking rocks at Jay  And then fucking  Set the place on fire 
[02:40:00]  And he got sued  How great would that be  Damn Yankees was a  You come out of Styx  Yeah  And you go into that  Pretty different direction  As far as musically goes  A lot more hard rock  Yeah yeah  Well  My whole career  I've always  Just kind of  Faked my way  Into the next thing  And when I joined Styx  I'd been in a soul band  I was in an  Eight piece horn band 
[02:40:30]  And you know  We played a little bit  Like some Uriah Heep  But in like  CTA stuff  And  But it  Really wasn't like  A hard rock band  And Styx was a  Progressive rock band  Right yeah  And so  But I was able to sing  And hit the parts  And I looked the part  And I actually  Was a songwriter  And lead singer  And lead guitar player  So I was qualified  For that gig  And I was like  They gave me  All the albums  I went home  And learned the set  And kind of  Went out and just  Started  Okay  I've still got the job 
[02:41:00]  You know  And then how did  Like Damn Yankees  Come about  I mean you got  I went to my manager  At the time  And I had  You know  It wasn't the  High point of my  Figuring out life  And behaving like  A responsible person  So I made some  Solo albums  But I realized  That you shouldn't  You shouldn't do  A lot of blow  And drink heavily  When you're in  The creative process  Sounds good to you  At the time  Right  It has sort of  A dire effect  On the quality 
[02:41:30]  Of your performances  And also  I was used to  Being in a band  The whole time  So I was kind of  Lost in those early days  Trying to make  Solo records  And I went to my manager  And said  I want to be in a band again  And he called  Our friend  John Kolodner  And John  And it just so happened  Ted's manager  Doug Banker  Was in Kolodner's office  That day  And we were  We were all kind of  Thinking  We wanted to do  Something different  And John said  What about you  And Ted Nugent  And Ted and I  Had just seen each other  We were down at a conference  In Miami  Where the heads of 
[02:42:00]  Some of the major labels  Were showing  Oh they're talking about  Making this dat player  Into something portable  Ha they'll never do that  And we're sitting back there  Going  Jackass  We're laughing at these guys  And so we had just  Seen each other  And I was like  Well  I would have never  Thought of that  But sure  So Ted came to New York  Michael Cardelloni  Was already in  The solo band  That I was in  At the time  And so Ted  Just kind of came in  And we started jamming  And we actually 
[02:42:30]  Sat down and wrote  The song  Come Again  And Ted  Ted wrote the lyrics  To that song  Really  Do you remember  That song  I was a loner  Cruising with the wind  I wasn't looking  When you pulled me in  And I had to leave you  Like I always did  And you damn well 
[02:43:00]  I'd come again  Really like  Nice  Sweet lyrics  And I'm going  And Ted was  He was in love  And he was like  Yeah really  That's not  But we saw this side  Of Ted  That not only  Was he this  He was Ted Nugent  But he also had  This kind of  Sensitive side  To him  And  He actually wrote  Those lyrics  To a shotgun  He did  He was  He did have a gun  On him  At the time 
[02:43:30]  We discovered  That too  But we started  Working like that  And it just  Came together  And within a couple  Of weeks  Jack  Jack Blades  Also called  John Collarder  And said  I want to  I want to be in a band  I want to rock  And so Jack  Showed up  On my doorstep  And this  This all happened  So quickly  And at the time  We'd been trying  To get sticks  Back together  But we were so  We were just  We were just  We were such  A slow moving  You know  Burgeoning organization 
[02:44:00]  It was like  Trying to get  Something done  In a big corporation  You know  You'd have to  Get meetings  And people would  Have to fly in  And it would have  Taken years  To try and  Just get back together  Damn Yankees  Was two  Three phone calls  You want to do it  Yeah okay  There's our  You know  It was settled  Do you ever  Look and think  Wow this has  Success written  All over it  Because I mean  You guys had  Some hits  With the  Damn Yankees  Did you  Think it would  It would just  Be kind of  Alright we're all  In a band now  Let's go out  Kick it around  Have some fun  Or did you really 
[02:44:30]  Think alright  I think we got  Something here  Where we can  Get some hits  We wrote all this  Music  Jack came in my  House and he was  Downstairs doing  Laundry  And I heard him  Down there going  I don't want to  Hear about it  Anymore  And I'm like  Alright what's  What's the next  Line  And so I went  Over to the  Piano and I went  Can you take me  High enough  To fly me over  And I said  Jack come  Come on back  Upstairs  Drop the laundry 
[02:45:00]  You wrote high enough  And we've just  The music just  Started flowing  Like that  So we're thinking  This is going  To be great  So we made  Some demos  Kolodner said  He's going to  Put us in  The hit factory  And he put us  Over this place  Over in  Hell's kitchen  That we're  Looking out the  Window and you  Can see down  In the railroad tracks  People are down  There shooting  Heroin and stuff  So it wasn't  We call it  The shit factory  But we did  All our demos  There and it  Was all you know  Bad reputation  All the songs 
[02:45:30]  Were on the  First Damn Yankees  Album  Started playing it  For record company  Guys  And the head  Of major labels  Had come over there  And we're playing  This stuff  One in particular  Who knows who he is  And he's still  Successful  But we finished  One of the songs  It might have been  Coming of age  Or something like that  And he's over there  Looking at his watch  And he says  Man look  I gotta run  Do you guys want to  Hear the new  Stones single  And we're like  Sure man  Fine  Whatever  But it wasn't  Until  You know  That Michael Austin  At Warner Brothers 
[02:46:00]  Heard it  He signed us up  Believed in this  Got Ron Nevison  To produce it  Then it started  Feeling like it was  Going to be a success  Yeah  But we still  Had to pay some dues  How great is it  That asshat  Has to know  That he passed  There's nothing  Better than that  Than just to succeed  Some guy  With the reputations  Of the people  That were there  I could see if it  Was just four unknowns  But I mean  You guys sitting there  And for this guy  To still be a pompous  Idiot about it  It's like  Good fuck him  You know  It put us  With the right guy  If he had 
[02:46:30]  If he had said  I'll sign you guys  To see what  Happened  You know  No support  You may never  Have heard of that  Yeah  It turns out  Michael Austin  Was behind us  The whole way  Anthony  Wasn't one of your  Wedding songs  A damn Yankee song  Let me think  Wow  I think it might have been  A lot of listeners  Saying  Wasn't Ann's wedding song  A damn Yankee song  Yeah  Yeah  That marriage  Didn't work out  I hope you guys  I hope you guys  In the band  Got along better  Than me and the  Old wife did  Wait you guys  Wrote taps  We got obviously 
[02:47:00]  Tommy Shaw in studio  He's got a guitar  You want to really  Sing something for us  Instead of a little piece  Sounds amazing  What do you got for us  Today Tommy  It's really up to you  What do you want  Well of course  We'd go with  Renegade or something  But I don't know  What was that first  Because I'm not as  Familiar with Dan Yanke  As I am with  High enough  What was the first one  You would use  Yeah the first one  You could play that one  All the way through  Which one was that  You said 
[02:47:30]  On the Ted Rote  All the sensitive ones  Yeah that sounds  Really good  Yeah  Voice really sounds good  Let's start second verse  Now I'm falling  Where I've never been  My resistance  This is the highest  One ever so  Wearing fins  Somewhere in the distance  Like a long lost friend  Oh yeah yeah 
[02:48:00]  Lord here I come again  Come again  Yeah yeah  Yeah yeah  Woo 
[02:48:30]  Been so long since I've seen you girl  Where I've been around the world  Every room is an empty space  In the darkness I see your thing  Oh yeah yeah  Yeah yeah yeah  When I finally get my hands on you 
[02:49:00]  Tell you what I'm gonna do  Rip you down  Lay you down  Make love to you  Till the morning comes around  I wasn't looking  When you're falling in  When you fall in the air  When you fall in the air  When you fall in the air  Oh yeah yeah  Yeah yeah 
[02:49:30]  Love oh dear I come again  Come again  Come again  Come again  Come again  Come again  Come again  I wasn't looking  When you put me in  Oh, yeah, yeah, Lord, here I come again 
[02:50:00]  You got a kid in your shit.  Something like that, don't you?  You nailed it.  I'm a Shaw.  I know we've been like, woo!  Yeah, 9.30 in the morning.  You know something?  That sounded fantastic, man.  Thank you.  But it's fun to watch a performer, because as you're going through it, I'm watching you go like, 
[02:50:30]  what the fuck was that next verse?  Just kind of grabbing for it, and it's like, a lot of guys don't want to sing this early in the morning.  You sound great, too.  Just great.  Unbelievable.  Everybody's requesting stick songs.  I mean, everything from Crystal Ball to Renegade and everything in between.  Well, Kevin and I came up with it, because Kevin Cronin and I were in town promoting the tour,  and we had a Broadway debut the other night.  Kevin Cronin and I actually performed on Broadway the other night in the curtain call for Rock of Ages. 
[02:51:00]  But as we're doing this, we're thinking, you know, we're doing TV shows, and they want bumpers and stuff.  So we're like, what the fuck are we going to do?  We came up with almost like a bluegrass version of Renegade, because Renegade's hard to do.  It's an orchestral show song.  I thought you'd do it.  Oh, Mama, I can hear you crying. 
[02:51:30]  You're so scared.  You're so scared and all alone.  Hangman is coming down from the chaffin, and I don't have them alone.  The jig is up, don't lose it out 
[02:52:00]  They finally found me  The renegade who had it made  A tree for a bounty  Now I'm going to go and say  This will be the end of the game  When I want to be now  Oh my God, what else can we do?  What else can we do?  I'm having fun.  Tommy Shaw, on tour all summer with Sticks  And R.E.L. Speedwagon  And 38 Special 
[02:52:30]  That's right  You're going to be here in the area too  I was asking  When are you going to be in?  PNC  June 24th  And all tickets you can get  Ticketmaster or TommyShaw.com  These shows will obviously sell out  You guys are one of those bands  That were just all over MTV  Right after its inception  Yeah, Too Much Time was played  During the first hour of MTV  Oh really?  Yeah, and that one was just played a lot 
[02:53:00]  But it was one of those you just sit and watch  And stuff and look at your funny faces  Oh I know  The videos  You know, and we were kind of scot-free  And then it comes along YouTube  And now they're  They're all back  They're all back  After a while I was like  No one could see these now anymore  Good, they're tucked away  I know  Oh, the bangs, you know  Oh, come on  That shit  It seemed right at the time though, Tommy  Come on  Totally brings me right back  When I watched that shit 
[02:53:30]  I thought I was so cool back then  You were back then  It was the shit, man  Tommy, you were always cool  That was what you wanted to do back then  That was like how you  Never do drugs and cut your own hair  Don't, don't  No matter how good an idea it takes  No one looks back and thinks  I think they call it with everyone  It's called the asshole infinity syndrome  It's like whenever you look back  You're like, what an asshole I was  But now I'm okay  And then five years from now  You look back and think you're an asshole 
[02:54:00]  I'm an asshole now  Yeah  When we first got the band back together in Stix  We thought, hey, look how much cooler we look now  I look back at those 10 years ago  And we're like, what were we thinking?  Again  I know  So I'm like, am I today?  I'm going to look back at these jeans and a t-shirt  What a stupid idea this was  You can't really lose with jeans and a t-shirt though  That's the genius of Malcolm Young  Never looks out of style  Yeah, it's true  How long has Stix been back together? 
[02:54:30]  Well, on the 24th of this month  It was 10 years since Lawrence Gowan joined the band  Oh my gosh  I know, can you believe this?  And he sounds a lot like Venice  Well, you know, he doesn't really  When you start A-B-ing them  But his voice sounds so good in that register  That, you know, if you're not just playing things side by side  It really does justice to the songs  And in the past 10 years, he's really made them his own  Is there like, um, is there like real bitterness between you guys? 
[02:55:00]  Or have you just kind of, did you grow apart artistically?  Or do you really like, like, eh, this is probably somebody I'll never work with again?  I never say never to anything  But really, the whole time that we were in a band together  We never really hung out  I think Dennis came to my house one time  The whole time we were in the band  And it wasn't that we weren't friends  It was just that we saw each other enough on the road  And he lived in Chicago  And I lived in Michigan  And, uh, you know, we were  When we were doing that 
[02:55:30]  There wasn't this appetite in the media  For all this intrigue  And what's going on  And any kind of  So you never knew anything about what was going on with Styx  We could have these horrendous arguments  If you ever see this video of a song called  Sing for the Day  You know, we look like the sweetest bunch of little American guys  We had just had this  We were ready to kill each other's argument  Okay, guys, here we go  Beep, beep, beep 
[02:56:00]  There goes the playback thing  And we're like  Looking at each other and smiling  And my wife says  You guys look like you were about ready to have sex with each other  No, it's just because we were so pissed off  It was like  I ain't showing it  You're going to show it?  And no one ever knew  That we just had differences of opinions on stuff  And it made a good behind the music  Because at the time  We were  Everybody just kind of separated  And we were still trying to figure  You know when you  It's like a divorce 
[02:56:30]  Okay, you can move away and everything  But wait a minute  I bought that couch  That's my couch  I want that fucking couch  And then after all you know  I am getting the couch  Okay, but I'll give you some money  You can get a new couch  So you're happy to wear bands out now  Like you're happier  I think everybody's happier  You know  Dennis is  He's such a great creative force  And he  You know  He's single-minded in his  What he wants to do  And a lot of that really led to the success of the band  And I was just 
[02:57:00]  Kind of a kid when I grew up  When I grew up in Styx  But there came a day where  His likes went more towards the theatrical stuff  And ours were still kind of the progressive band  That we'd always been  What was a piece of the theatrical  Or what was something that would happen on stage  I never saw that stage show  But I remember hearing about it  It's like it was  People talked about the strain it had put on the band  What was some of that  Well, like you said  They had to start performing  And doing the robot  And all this  But is that what you would do?  I don't know  What did he conceptualize? 
[02:57:30]  It got very  I've seen Styx a million times  They got very theatrical  And he just wanted to kind of just be in a band  Yeah  That was the separation  That really should have been a theatrical performance  But our whole way of doing things  Was to route a tour  Go out and play arenas  And then try and play as many  You know  Play some stadiums  And things like that  But that really belonged in a theater  And we came to New York  We played  What was the name of that theater?  City Center  And the trouble is 
[02:58:00]  You know  The momentum of the band  And the way things normally do  You gear up and you do all this stuff  So we're bringing in all the truckloads of stuff  And you can only put about 15  Maybe 1,500 people in that place  So it started just snowballing  The expense of the whole thing  And we didn't have any sponsors or anything  So we're just all writing checks for this thing  That we didn't really want to do  And so all those things  After eight years  It just  And we had a new management company  Our old manager knew how to get in between us 
[02:58:30]  And solve those things  And we could go yell at him  And go  This guy  I fucking hate him  And the other guy would say  I hate that motherfucker too  But we would never say it to each other  Right  We had new management  So we had no one in between us  And so all these things really came  It just  You start crumbling the foundation of the band  And like I said  We really should have taken time off  How is Nugent to collaborate with?  Because he seems like  When you interview him  Ted's a very headstrong guy  He seems like  But is he a fun guy 
[02:59:00]  To collaborate with  And like  To sit down and bounce  Like I don't like that line  Maybe he'll try this line  Ted  Ted's  What I love about Ted  Is he will come in  And he'll throw everything he's got down  On the table  First  In the first ten minutes  And he can basically leave  And you can take what he has put down right there  And you can work entire songs around it  And Ted's  He's got a short attention span  He's like this guy  He gets more done in one day  Than most people get done in a month 
[02:59:30]  Yeah  So once you figure that out with Ted  You don't expect him to be around for the whole thing  And so  Like with High Enough  Jack and I wrote this thing  But we were in my apartment here in New York  And all I had was a keyboard  And a little thing to record it on  So  It was fucking keyboards  Which Nugent  He uses keyboards for target practice  Serious  He does?  Yeah  He blows up keyboards  He's not a keyboard fan  No  I know  I know  That's funny  Yeah  So  So here we are 
[03:00:00]  We made this demo  With a drum machine  And a keyboard  That's all I had  You know  That I could record  I didn't have microphones in the place  But it was high enough  And  Shit this sounds good  But it's got keyboards in it  So what are we going to do  So we're taking it back to the  Where we were rehearsing  We were playing it for the crew  And you're going  Shit this sounds good  What are we going to do  It's got keyboards  And the Nugent  Happened to walk in  And over here  You know  And said  All this thing needs  Is a  You know  Gets his guitar on  Turns it up all the way  And puts all the Nugent on it 
[03:00:30]  And he was right  But that's really  That was Ted's contribution  To high enough  Was that he put the Ted Nugent stamp on it  So he didn't ask  He didn't complain about the keyboards being in it  There weren't any  We took the keyboards out  Oh you took them out  Yeah that was just the demo  Oh okay  Replace it with Ted  Yeah  And then it just worked  Yeah  People are requesting  Fooling yourself  Could you give us a taste  Of fooling yourself  Yeah  It's made for the acoustic guitar 
[03:01:00]  I think  Fooling yourself  You see the world  Through your cynical eyes  You're a troubled young man  I can tell  You got it all  At the bottom of your hands  Your hands are wet with sweat 
[03:01:30]  And your head needs rest  And you're fooling yourself  If you don't believe  You're kidding yourself  If you don't believe in  Why must you be  Such an angry young man  When your future is quite right to me  How can there be  Such a sinister plan  That could hide in such a land 
[03:02:00]  Such a caring young man  And you're fooling yourself  If you don't believe it  And you're killing yourself  If you don't believe it  Yeah  Get out  I'll get back on your feet  You're the one making me  And you know it  Yeah  Come on  Come on  Let's see what you got  I'll just take your best shot  And I'll go away 
[03:02:30]  Wow  Tommy Shaw  Pulling yourself  We got the coolest jobs  Just sitting here watching him play that for us  That's amazing  This is kind of a fucking fun gig  I get to watch your show from like three feet away 
[03:03:00]  I know, you forget sometimes  I was literally thinking that  Why do we bitch ever?  Why?  Why do we bitch?  And they said that you don't like playing babe  And that's fine  But I remember the first song I was telling them before  And I really got a fucking beating for it  Was that the first song I ever had associated with a girl  Was babe  And then here's one of the guys in the band fucking singing  Hey look, I wrote the solo part to that song  We played it one time  And it just does  That's a personal song that Dennis wrote for his wife 
[03:03:30]  Yeah  He asked us not to play it  He asked me, you know  There were a couple of times where I kind of took the piss out of it  In Chicago and one time in particular  Damn Yankees played there  And you know, we're all full of ourselves  And you know  There's still a little bit of rivalry going on back then  And so we're at the World Theater, I think  And we did this thing  And I come out, you know  In the middle of the damn Yankee set  Instead of playing come again  I go  I always wanted to play this song 
[03:04:00]  So I started playing babe  And Nugent's kind of hovering over me  Like  And he said  He taps me on the shoulder  He said  Look  Your guitar's a little bit out of tune  Let me just check it out for you  And he takes my guitar off  And smashes it  And throws it out in the audience  Well Dennis' daughter was in the audience  And she came back and said  That was kind of shit  You know  That wasn't cool  What did you think when you saw her face  When she came back  We all go  Bleh  You know you do shit  We in Chicago 
[03:04:30]  You think you're really funny  And after you think about it  It was like  Wasn't that funny  Hi  I was just thinking of your dad  That was awkward  You thought he was in St. Louis  We ran into each other in an elevator  In Syracuse, New York  And we kind of worked that all out  And I said  Yeah I won't do that anymore  Yeah  It's funny  What did you  Did you ever see  Cartman's rendition of  Come Sail Away  That was fantastic  Yeah  Did you think that was hysterical  Well we had  Todd our drummer  Had brought us  Like a third or fourth generation 
[03:05:00]  Videotape  Of the first episode  Of South Park  Where it was Santa and Jesus  Oh yeah  Oh yeah  Classic  So we were on with South Park  From the very beginning  When it was just underground  Like that  So when we were like  Spoofed on South  That was like  Think about it  You know  Yeah that is pretty cool  That was very cool  And like in Jack's  Jack Blade's son James  Who was about  I think he was in college  At the time  He'd never even heard  Come Sail Away before  And he was like  That's you  That's your guy's song 
[03:05:30]  So it really  Anytime something new  Like that comes along  And introduces a whole  New generation  To your music  You know  You gotta love it  Thank your lucky stars  What do you think  Of bands going on  Way past the original members  Leaving the band  Because we talk about that  From time to time  It really depends on  You gotta judge it  Band by band  Sometimes it works  Sometimes it doesn't  Yeah like  Oh yeah sure  You got Journey  The new singer for Journey  Sounds exactly like Steve Perry 
[03:06:00]  But I think that  To the point where  It becomes a tribute band  You know  Except you got  The rest of the band  Yeah yeah  But I'm saying  Those guys eventually retire  Move on  And then the new guy  From Journey  All of a sudden  You got a hit  So then  You know what I mean  The popularity stays up  As you guys decide  To move on  Yeah  It's almost like  A franchise in the end  Like you could be  Sitting home  Well and Journey  Journey is a unique thing  Their song list  Is so good  And it's so  It's like part of my DNA 
[03:06:30]  It's like  You know  And to have Journey  Continuing on  Especially with a guy  Who's that good  Of a singer  That he was  And inspired the band  To play better  And he sings those songs  Like Steve Perry  At his peak  And it's so good  It's like  Well  Okay  I know  It's like  I know you're not  My old girlfriend  But you look just like  You look like her  You look like a younger  Version of her  You fuck better than her  And you ask for less money  Than her  So let's go  I'm just 
[03:07:00]  You know  I'll  It's the  What is that  The  The disbelief thing  Like when you're watching a movie  You know  I guess  So with Journey  I'm so glad  They're still out there  Playing those songs  Because you want to hear  Those songs  Oh the people  The places are packed  I mean  I think the biggest thing  Is the lead singer  The lead singer  The worst is when  You go to see a band  I don't mind  If you get  Everybody gets older  But when you go  And the dude  Can't sing anymore  And the high notes  And they just stick the mic  Out to the crowd  Or they just cut it off  Really quick 
[03:07:30]  Or they just say it  Instead of singing it  Or they got like  A line of backup singers  Doing it  Yeah  The high part of something  I mean that's  I guess  I guess that's  Taking care of yourself  Partly  Partly just age  Or something  I mean  You sound fantastic  I mean  You still obviously  Have the pipes there  Which is  Oh yeah  Great  Yeah  Sometimes you look at it  Like a  Like a  57 Chevy  You know  You want to see  The 57 Chevy  That's been redone  From the ground up  You know  With the new paint job  On it 
[03:08:00]  Or you want the one  That's been sitting out  You know  Sometimes it's the one  That's sitting out  In the field  And it's just not  It won't start  You know  And it's all original  Yeah  Not quite there  Sit out behind a barn  But then you got sometimes  The all original one  That somebody's taken  Really good care of  You know  So it's  It's all  Band by band  You gotta  Yeah  We're heading toward a break  But is there anything else  You want to play for us Tommy  Before we hit that break  Or  I mean you've done a great job  Is there something new  That you have a guy  That you're promoting  That's new  I don't know 
[03:08:30]  Where you want us to go  With this  Well we got the  I can  Kevin and I wrote this  Can't Stop Rockin'  I wrote this  Can't Stop Rockin' song  New single to promote the tour  Yeah  With Aria Speedwagon  Sticks  And everybody in both bands  Play it on it  I sing the first version  Kevin sings the second  I'll sing the first version  Hey now brother  I can see it in your face  You don't understand  How you got into this place  Big shots  Sticking handouts 
[03:09:00]  Well guess who paid  Now they're telling us  To change our ways  So you tighten your belt  And dirty your hands  Wake up your  Blink up  Let me  And they tune my guitar up  See ya  Tighten your belt  And dirty your hands  Wake up your boots  And make a stand  Raise your fist  And be a man  Put the bell to the mail  For the promise of life  This house is shaking 
[03:09:30]  Nobody's a knockin'  Whoa  We can't stop rockin'  The doors are open  No need will not come  Whoa  We can't stop rockin'  The road is home  But we'll still carry on  You can't stop rockin'  Can't stop rockin'  We can't stop rockin'  Something like that

[03:11:30]  Of that  Oh  Where the hell  Those will pop up someday  And be like  Hey look what I found  Someone's attic  We thought we had a line on them  The lady whose husband  Owned the studio  Where the stuff was recorded  She said  I've got a bunch of stuff  In the basement  Not only yours  But a whole bunch  Of other band stuff  Holy shit  That's been there for 30 years  And she  But before she gave the stuff up  She said  I really need to be paid  For the storage of this stuff  For 30 years  And so  You know  Trying to get a corporation  To do that 
[03:12:00]  They finally figured it out  Like the day before  You know  A couple of few days  Before the deadline  And our stuff  Wasn't in there  So  So you guys  Paid her storage  And it wasn't even in there  No  Universal had to  Work out a deal  With her  They got a bunch  Of stuff back  But it wasn't in there  Alright  Sean Cassidy  William Shatner's  Original solo work  Awful stuff  Oh yeah  The worst stuff ever  Let's get Tommy Shaw  Out of here  That was great  Thanks so much  Thanks for having me guys

[03:13:00]  Trying to lie  Hurting other people  And making them cry  I'd haul them off to jail  In my awesome van  Cause I would be  Awesome man  Yeah  Then I say kids  Now you know  We all know that  When people offer you  Drugs and alcohol  Like me  You just say no  Right  If I could be  A superhero  I would be  A drug free boy  Telling the world 
[03:13:30]  Of the evils of drugs  And all of the lives  They destroy  Well I'd take all the junkies  Getting so high  With their needles  And bongs  And their sticks  Made of Thai  As I burn them alive  I would squeal with joy  Cause I would be  Drug free boy  If I could be 
[03:14:00]  A superhero  I'd be  Immigration dude  I'd send all the foreigners  Back to their homes  For eating up  All of our food  And taking our welfare  And best jobs to boot  Like landscaping  Dishwashing  Picking our fruit  I'd pass a lot of laws  To get rid of their brood  Cause I'd be  Immigration dude  And I have the kids  Imagine what superhero 
[03:14:30]  They would be  They could be  Any superhero  If you could be  A superhero  Would you be  Justice guy  Making sure people  Get what they deserve  Especially women  Who lie  Like if a wife  Left her husband  With three kids  And no job  To run off to  Hawaii  With some doctor  Named Bob  You could skin them  And drain them  Of blood  So they'd die  Especially Bob 
[03:15:00]  Then you would be  Justice guy  Or you could be  More subtle  I didn't mean  To be vague  Give her  The mad cow disease  Let him die  Of the plague  As long as  They suffered  For their horrible  Lie  Especially Bob  Then you would be  Justice guy  Yes then you would be  A superhero  Like me  Steven Lynch 
[03:15:30]  There you go  That one's for the kids  Well being Anthony  I just want to say  Before we start talking  To Colin Quinn  How great was Tommy Shaw  Phenomenal  Motherfucker  Really good man  I felt like an asshole  Why were you  Feeling like an asshole  I've done nothing but  Trash that band forever  And then he comes on  And he's fucking awesome  I gotta say  I was a big Styx fan  Growing up  I forgot  I know  You know what  It was actually  I liked the earlier stuff  Absolutely the earlier stuff 
[03:16:00]  It's more like  That later stuff  It was  Mr. Roboto  Was a good song  I liked the song  For like a guilty pleasure  Like a goof  I hate to say that  But too much time  A goof  But too much time  On my hands  Was when the band  Lost me  With all that  That lady  Babe  All that  I couldn't stand  So then I felt like an asshole  Yeah but you gotta go a little deeper  Like uh  Castles  What was that  Castles song  Castles in  Uh  Castles in the Seins  That's  Believe me  I wanted to say that  But I was afraid  You'll be wrong  Castles 
[03:16:30]  Castles in the Sky  Castles  Whatever  Call Castles in Sky  He was great  He was great  That's what we're getting at  I'm trying to throw  Some Styx knowledge  Who gives a shit  Even if I had it  He was just telling me  Some vocal tricks  About uh  What  Just about like your voice  He said that  He sounds really fucking good  At this hour  To be able to pull that off  Guy was hitting those high notes  He got some nice like  Rasp to his voice too  And shit  When he wanted to  And he was a good interviewer 
[03:17:00]  And I told him  Why didn't we think about that  Years ago  Where you get these guys  Just to play a piece of a song  Cause then you get a lot more songs out of them  Yeah you get like a verse  And then a chorus  Another verse  And then you're done  Usually a lesson like that  Comes in  They play an old classic  And then their new song  And that's it  We got four or five songs out of them  That's great  Say to everybody that comes in  Hey do your fucking greatest hits for us  Yeah  Come on  Montage your hits  Go  Alright Colin Quinn lost a lot of weight  Yeah I told you  Forty pounds  I'm guessing  Yeah I'd say forty

[03:19:30]  So now we can finally move on  From that dumb castle song  I got a charge for an autograph  I didn't like  Billy Burr's posture  During his song  He was slumped over  Like  Was he trying to be  Like a fucking renaissance king  Did I not explain myself?  I just  I felt like  I said it on air  I said I felt like an asshole  Because not only  I trashed and made fun of that band  I was making fun of it  On the way in  And then he comes in  He's fucking awesome  He's a great guy  And everything  I was just one of those  Like ah god  I'm a douchebag  You did explain yourself perfectly  But I just wanted to  Trash you anyway about it  I thought it was 
[03:20:00]  A two court for the room  One of my comedy club t-shirt  I figured he'd go with that  Road hack  That is pretty disgusting  Road hack  Why don't you move the mic closer  You're fucking leaning into it  Like a fucking corpus  The fact that Tommy Short  The fact that Tommy Short  Knew Jimmy Norton's material  That hurts  That hurts  He knew Jimmy's act  Oh yeah  He's like  Oh yeah  Yeah  We saw you  We watch your DVD  On the bus  On the tour bus  Yeah  You know how it is  Celebrities recognize each other  What am I going to do  What happens  They all know the kid

[03:21:30]  The funniest thing ever  But we refused  To interview anyone  I know they were like  Hi  Remember Dale Earnhardt  They did  Dale Earnhardt Jr  We lost fucking  Mick Jagger walked over  And they said hi  And he walked away  He walked away  Management hated us  They didn't get the bit  We're like no  The bit is  We're there  But we're not going to  Interview nobody  It was the publicity people  That kept like  Ushering the people away  Cause like you said  Mick Jagger was coming over  And then the handlers  Saw Lady Diane Marion  And just went  Oh no no no  And like would push them away 
[03:22:00]  Like they're taking  A bullet for him  It was horrible  Because that's so great  Is in the middle of this show  That at the time  And they were like  Really popular  MTV  It thinks of itself  As the hippest  Fucking beautiful people  Even though they would  Never say that  About themselves  They're too hip  Of course  But they thought  They were just  Everybody's just dressed  And fucking  And to see those two  Wretches of the fucking  As if I can quote  The Statue of Liberty  The wretched refuse  Wretched refuse  Standing there like  All enthusiastic  And like hi 
[03:22:30]  Dale Earnhardt Jr  I'm sorry about your father  I'm sorry about your father  Yelling like  What are you wearing  Or who are you wearing  They're just  I'm sorry  I hear about your father  Dale Earnhardt Jr  Come over here  We want to talk to you  Oh my god  You didn't see that  Jimmy Buffet in Orlando  Dishirts  No they got their hair  Done for the damn thing  Yeah they got all  Gussied up  They went to the parlor  They were all gussied up  And they got new dresses  From like Kmart or something  You're forgetting the bit  They took it very seriously  I know  It's the greatest thing 
[03:23:00]  Of all time  Hey you got a clip of that  Fantastic  We got to find a clip of that  The funniest part  Of fucking Lady Di  With that awful hair  When they made her  Fucking paint  A little black mustache  On herself  And every time she walked in  They played  The fucking  The Laurel and Hardy music  She looked  Just like him  With that greasy  Fucking  1920s hairdo  She had on  That music  That  Yeah  Now Marion 
[03:23:30]  We have to ask  Some questions  I was just trying  To get Dale Earnhardt Jr  He's very upset  At you  Sorry about your father  Now let me have it  The pie  Let me have it  And if they ever  That's the saddest part  Is the tragedy  Is that they ended like  Edgar Allan Poe  And like Van Gogh  Their genius led to madness  Yeah  Lady Di ended up homeless 
[03:24:00]  Blowing fucking  Men under the train tracks  Yeah  It was wonderful  Good  Good for her  Exactly  That's called  That's pretty much  What should have happened  Oh she should have been  Found like that  Fucking nanny  In Boston  Half of her  Would have weighed  As much as a regular person  But  On the dumpster  Yeah  Old dumpster nanny  You wanted to see her torso  Floating in the fucking  Oh yeah  Oh and I want to see

Jesus  And then we got Scorch there Colin  Yeah yeah  And we found some gold  With Scorch  That we want to play for you  You know Scorch is fantastic  Scorch has a TV show  Yeah I heard you  Sam was telling me  Why don't you convey  Some of your favorite  Scorch moments  Well just any kind of  When he gets rowdy  With any kind of like  You know hey  Today was like 
[03:25:30]  Midget  I remember just listening  He always had like  These great things  And they were like  You know it was like  Shock Jock  1988 shit  You know  Only it was 2000  Yeah  It was like  Hey today we got  Midget naked  Rest  Do show dressing  Do show dressing  That was a great one  Is it do show dressing  And Colin was reminding us  At the time we had  Our listeners throw  Yellow paint on him  While he was in a cage  He's Scorch trying to do  Some good  He's trying to do  Some good charity work  For animal rights  Which everyone agrees with  So he goes in a cage 
[03:26:00]  Like a dog  And actually  When I was going  To the prospect  For him  He was tripping on acid  One of the workers  That unlocked himself  In the cage  My friend's brother  And it became  Like a national story  Meanwhile he's just tripping  And he locked himself  In like  These animals are mistreated  But he's just like tripping  You know  And it became like  Hey this guy's like deep  You know  He's just dirty  He's like a mesclin down  Fucking chase  But Scorch did his version  Of that  In Syracuse  Sam tells me  He's now in Manchester  It's just a good market 
[03:26:30]  No yeah  They call it what again  Manch Vegas  Manch Vegas  Why do they call it that  I have no idea  There's no reason  For it either  The place is the furthest  Thing from Vegas  I'm sure there's a clever  Reason for that  Oh my gosh  They're just pumping up  Punching up the  The coolness factor  Just by putting Vegas  On a name like  Well because people  Think it's like  Not so much a party town  With a name like  Manchester  But it is  And so they have to  Bring it up to  Manch Vegas  Letting people know  You know  If Las Vegas 
[03:27:00]  Is a little far  Manch Vegas  Is right around the corner  So is there gambling there  Probably not  I don't know  Are there casino  Like maybe hotels  Is there some shiny lights  Big light shows  No it's not like  No it's not known for that  So it's nothing like Vegas  It's more the spirit  The spirit of Vegas  The spirit  Has this suffix  What's  What goes on  I don't even know  The saying anymore  Are we going to give  What happens in Manch Vegas  Stays in Manch Vegas  Is that  Because nobody cares 
[03:27:30]  Yeah  Because nobody gives a shit  What happens in Manch Vegas  Stinks  Are we going to give  Colin a little  We're happy  Please  There's one  You've got to see it  Do we want to replay  The  I say just the part  Where he's explaining  There's a scene  Where  Where Scorch kind of  Gets a little bit serious  And I think that's important  I emailed Danny some clips  I think at least  The first part  Of the first episode  That we already watched  Yeah  And then there's  Some other clips  That show some of  The really cool segments  That he does on PFG TV
