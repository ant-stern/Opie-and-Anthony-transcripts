<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with Anthony recounting two separate incidents in New York City where he felt he was targeted due to his race.  The first involved a verbal altercation with a pedestrian and a group of young men after he braked suddenly.  The second, from the previous day, involved a woman who bumped him.  Anthony expressed anger and frustration, interpreting these events as a post-Obama election shift in attitudes. He claimed racial slurs were used in both encounters.  This sparked a discussion with callers, some agreeing with Anthony, others criticizing his interpretations. The show also briefly touched upon a suicide outside Paula Abdul's mansion and a news story about racist graffiti in Mastic. A caller identifying himself as a member of the Aryan Brotherhood voiced support for Anthony's views.

The conversation then shifted to a broader discussion about race and the Obama election. Opie shared a similar experience of a perceived racially motivated confrontation.  This led to a debate on the election's impact on societal friction.  Caller Nick recounted a story of a deported Kenyan who believed Obama's election would overturn his deportation.  Comedian Nick DiPaolo, a guest in the studio, discussed a heated on-air exchange he'd had with Shepard Smith of Fox News regarding alleged media bias toward Obama.  Audio of this exchange was played.  The discussion included a heated debate between Anthony and caller Coop, who expressed frustration with perceived arrogance among some Black individuals and the emasculating portrayal of white men in the media.  Coop's comments on power dynamics and historical context were challenged by Anthony.  Caller Marianne called Anthony a “sore loser white supremacist,” leading to a heated exchange with Anthony using highly offensive language.  Callers Assad and Dirty Harry (a Black man) offered differing perspectives.  A contentious call with Danny ended abruptly after a shouting match.

The show continued with a call from Mike from Buffalo, who recounted being knocked out for using a racial slur.  This led to a discussion about race and the hosts' upbringings, featuring in-studio guest Jim Norton. They discussed a liberal talk show host fired for cursing about Joe the Plumber on a hot mic; the audio clip was played.  The conversation then shifted to Brian Regan's touring schedule, followed by the tragic story of Paula Goodspeed, a Paula Abdul impersonator who died of a drug overdose near Abdul's home after numerous calls to her house.  A clip of Goodspeed's American Idol audition was played. Jim Norton discussed his basement renovation and frustrations with the radio industry and his website.  The hosts joked about Norton's home improvement ineptitude. The segment concluded with discussions of comedians' touring schedules, Howard Hughes' eccentricities, and Norton's habit of rewatching movies.

A significant segment focused on stock market trading, specifically short selling and put options. Opie explained the concepts, recounting past successes and failures. The conversation included tangents on the 2008 mortgage crisis, their poor investment in Citadel stock, an alpaca farm, and speculation about window washers outside their studio being CIA spies.  A listener requested a birthday message for her cancer-stricken husband, resulting in a darkly humorous exchange.  A news story about a lawsuit against Victoria's Secret for formaldehyde in their bras led to further tangents.  Listener calls continued, covering absurd situations like a mom posing as her daughter and a bartender demoted for weight gain.  The discussion included a picture of a horse's genitalia, sparking more raunchy jokes.  Listener calls on work, taxes, and absurd situations concluded this segment.

The next segment centered on Brian Regan's book success, with Regan as a guest. The conversation quickly devolved into graphic discussions of animal genitalia, crude jokes about bodily functions, racist humor, and vulgar descriptions.  Regan's discomfort led to his eventual departure. The hosts announced the return of their "homeless shopping spree" and discussed past conflicts.  Brief mentions of upcoming events and a dismissed segment on ghost hunters followed. The show concluded with continued offensive jokes and banter.

Finally, a segment featuring Nick, whose agent caused a scheduling mix-up, involved playful banter and humorous, offensive name-calling. Dr. Ted Kocko was also mentioned as being in the studio.

[00:01:30]  A finger everyone's holding.  Jimmy's impish.  I've been called imp other things.  As I sat there crying and a girlfriend laid on the bed going, it's okay.  You're impish.  I'm like, wrong words.  You're stupid.  Close your eyes, you're right.  Okay, and go.  Oh, f***.  But enough of this palaver. 
[00:02:00]  Let's get the show on the road.  And go.  Opie and Anthony.  Hey.  On your radio dial.  So, what happened to you?  Oh, what?  You want to get right into it?  Oh, yeah.  Because it's just, it just proves my point.  We all have a pattern.  Yeah.  And when I know you're a few minutes late.  Yeah.  No big deal.  Whatever.  But I do know that means something happened to you on the way to work. 
[00:02:30]  I was thinking to myself, I think it's time for another speeding ticket.  Although you don't actually get the tickets.  Wink, wink, nudge, nudge.  Well, you know.  Or does he?  You figure it out, people.  Knock wood.  I've been lucky.  So, I'm thinking, okay, he's a few minutes late.  So, I bet you he got pulled over for something.  But it wasn't a pullover, right?  No, no, it wasn't.  It wasn't.  It was a little discussion.  A little impromptu debate on the street here in the city. 
[00:03:00]  As you might recall, yesterday, I told you a story about some woman wearing a giant Obama  pin.  An African-American woman who gave me like a little bump with her shoulder.  Didn't look at me.  Didn't do anything.  And we had a discussion about that and how paranoid I am about the whole thing and how  racist I am and how I read it wrong.  Well, let me convey to you a little story that happened at 5.30 this morning that leaves 
[00:03:30]  nothing, nothing to the imagination about this attitude that is coming out because Obama  is now our president-elect.  Why is it only happening to you, though?  No, it's not.  I'm the only one bringing it up.  I'm the only one pursuing these things.  I'm the only one that isn't just going to take it and sit there like a dummy.  I walked around all day yesterday.  Not a hint of this.  Smiling white guy. 
[00:04:00]  Go ahead.  Just walk around.  Not a hint of this.  Because you're blind to it.  Open your eyes.  Anything happen to you yesterday?  I'm like Rowdy Roddy and they live.  I have the glasses.  I have the sunglasses.  All right.  What happened?  I'm sorry.  I had a lot of nice smiles.  Sure.  Same here.  Yeah.  Let me tell you about my little drive-in.  He's had two of these in two days.  That's what it comes down to.  Everything was fine.  I'm driving down 57th Street and I'm between lights. 
[00:04:30]  So I'm driving down 57th.  At what time?  This is 530-ish.  So the hustle and bustle of New York City in full effect.  Dude, no one.  Exactly.  It's like a ghost town.  But some gentleman decides to just walk in between lights, not at the crosswalk or anything,  in front of my vehicle, just comes out where I have to jam on the brakes.  And now because I had to do this, all lights are timed. 
[00:05:00]  I know these lights like the back of my hand.  I know how to make the lights when they're green and everything.  And it doesn't even bother me that I hit the red light when it should have been green.  And it bothered me that this idiot walked right in between intersections in front of my vehicle.  So I've stopped.  I have to slow down for the light now.  So I roll the window down.  Now, I have no idea what this guy's ethnic background is at the time.  I don't.  He's bundled up because it's chilly out in the morning. 
[00:05:30]  He's hunched over.  I don't know what he is.  I just know he walked in front of my vehicle.  So I went, hey, I go cross at the intersection.  You know, I'm doing like 40 miles an hour here.  You made me jam on the brakes.  Now he looks up and I see he's a black man.  There's also five black youths, which I will just call thugs, walking down the street, the sidewalk on the other side of the road. 
[00:06:00]  Going to their jobs like we do.  Stop making it funny.  Oh, I appreciate you think I'm funny.  Wait a minute.  It's the first time you admitted that in 10 years.  Thank you.  The library's not open this early.  Exactly.  Going to their jobs at IBM, man.  Like you say.  A gang of youths are walking down the street.  Could you say it right?  Youths.  Youths.  Yeah.  Walking down the sidewalk.  And they're to my left.  You know, I'm on the driver's side, obviously. 
[00:06:30]  I'm driving.  They're on my left on the sidewalk walking the opposite direction that I'm going.  But they hear me yelling this at the guy like, what are you walking in front of me?  I didn't use any racial epithets.  I didn't bring the guy that crossed in front of me, his car, his race.  I didn't bring that into question or anything.  I know why.  Why?  Because you were outnumbered.  No, I didn't even see the five black guys, youths, thugs walking down the sidewalk. 
[00:07:00]  And you didn't know what race this guy was because he was just a blur.  I didn't know.  He was just some idiot walking in front of my car.  I'd have yelled at anybody.  I've done it in the past.  People that have driven with me have seen me do this.  Whether it's a cab driver doing something stupid, a pedestrian, tourists, I will yell.  Well, if a tourist is standing in the crosswalk in a lane and I'm making a turn and he's blocking me,  MAP, hey, idiot, it's New York City, get on the sidewalk.  You know, I'll say this. 
[00:07:30]  But this guy crossed in front of my vehicle.  I start bitching him out.  Well, these youths, I guess, decide they're going to come to this guy's defense.  And what a great point one of them brought up as he yelled to me,  Obama President, nah.  Like that?  Obama President, nah.  First of all, in January, not nah.  President Bush is still the president, nah. 
[00:08:00]  So, you know, in January, then you can say, nah.  So he goes, Obama President, nah.  And then they all stop and turn to look at me.  And I just turned around and lost my effing mind.  Without dropping any big bombs, I just said, shut the eff up.  You know what you still are.  That's what I said.  You know what you still are.  What are you doing?  What am I doing?  I'm not taking this crap. 
[00:08:30]  I'm not taking this crap from this stupid group of effing jerk-offs that think they got some kind of a frigging something over me  because they think Obama President, nah.  Oh, no.  That this idiot can just now walk in front of my vehicle with impunity.  Yeah.  I yell at him for making a bonehead move, and now I'm getting yelled at by people that had nothing to do with this, by the way. 
[00:09:00]  Nothing to do with it.  I didn't say anything first.  They brought in the racial angle first.  That Obama President, nah, so this idiot can walk in front of my car now because he's black?  And they could now comment to me about that?  I think they were just trying to bond with you.  There's an excitement in this country.  He did because then they all turned around, and one of them, the guy that started mouthing off, he starts walking toward my vehicle on the sidewalk slow,  and he's looking at the sidewalk and kicking at stuff like he's trying to find something to throw at me because that's what you do. 
[00:09:30]  You pick stuff up, and you throw it, don't you?  That's what you do.  You're a high-profile radio host.  Dude, I can't take this anymore.  I can't take it.  I'm scared that my friend, who I love, is going to get himself killed.  What?  So be it.  Martyr me, dummies.  Martyr me!  Avenge me, boys!  Avenge me!  Red Dawn. 
[00:10:00]  So he's walking towards the truck?  Yeah.  I love the Anthony Hannity show.  Hey, Louie, New York, you're gone.  Oh, what the hell?  I'm bouncing you right out of the goddamn room.  I'm not joking.  Bye, Louie!  Louie beans.  Louie's gone.  I don't care if people know him.  I don't care.  Why'd you kick Louie out?  Here we go.  Admin.  Admin console.  Louie.  Louie NY.  Band selected user.  Now you won't even come back after a few days.  Gone!  Could you at least take your coat off today? 
[00:10:30]  Yeah, all right.  There you go.  At least take off your big, puffy coat.  My coat off.  My headphones are all getting discombobulated.  So you can't handle this crap.  So he's starting to walk toward the car.  And now he's yelling things at me about my racial background or what he thinks it is because it's just white.  So cracker is coming out.  He yelled cracker?  Yeah.  He called me.  Wow.  That's not good.  Peck-a-wood.  He said cracker. 
[00:11:00]  And just wait.  Obama president, nah.  And I just started yelling out some similarities between his actions and some other things, actions, that were very, very similar at that moment.  Because he was looking to throw something at my vehicle.  And he was getting riled.  I was really pissed.  Now I'm yelling out the window at him.  Were you yelling the good stuff?  No, I never dropped the hydrogen bomb. 
[00:11:30]  No.  I dropped a few bunker busters.  Yeah.  But not the hydrogen bomb.  And that's because I was being nice because it is public.  And perhaps there would have been somebody else on the street that may have been offended by that language.  So I kept that to a minimum.  Is that the reason or is the real reason the light was still red?  Oh, that light was red.  I was slow rolling towards it, too.  And I'm looking both ways going, I'm going to blow this light if these mother effers start running toward me. 
[00:12:00]  This light means nothing.  So he's looking for something to throw.  Yeah.  So the light turned green.  I start rolling away going, ha-ha, I'm gone.  Ha-ha, green light.  I get to leave.  I went ha-ha at him and threw a few more lines.  But you're too old to be doing ha-ha. 
[00:12:30]  No, I'm not.  You kind of are.  Nope.  Yeah.  Because I knew it bugged the crap out of him.  Yeah.  Obama president, nah.  But it's now.  That's what I had to hear.  Why would they say it that way?  It's now.  Why?  Yeah.  Don't ask me.  Don't ask me.  I was able to translate in my own head what it meant.  Yeah.  But that annoyed me.  And this is what we're dealing with.  Two days in a row.  Actually, not two days in a row.  I conveyed the story yesterday from, like, the weekend. 
[00:13:00]  All right.  So you got a day off from your race war that you're fighting with yourself.  From this race war.  That's a verbal race war that's going on.  Well, let me tell you something.  More and more circumstances like this are popping up.  And don't try to BS me or lull yourself into this false sense of security that this is not happening.  It is.  I'm seeing it.  I did not start this.  No one knew who I was.  I'm driving.  This guy steps in front of my vehicle. 
[00:13:30]  A guy, I don't know who he is.  I just see him as a guy in front of my vehicle.  I start yelling at him for making me jam on the brakes.  I'm 57th like that.  Make me miss my light.  And then a group of thugs start taunting me that Obama president now, and I can't comment that this idiot is walking in front of my vehicle because of that.  That's what the president's going to do for you.  Now you can walk in front of white people's cars, apparently, with impunity.  And we're supposed to jam on the brakes and stop and just say, oh, I'm sorry, sir. 
[00:14:00]  I'm sorry.  And then take the abuse from the sidewalk, from thugs at 530 in the morning on the sidewalk.  Sorry, we're picking slim this morning.  Not enough people to whack over their head with a cobblestone.  And Rob, I'm sick of it.  Sick of it.  It's just going to get worse.  This is the most fun I've ever had. 
[00:14:30]  It's just going to get worse, people.  The unraveling is the best ever.  Oh, yeah.  Can we take your temperature and your blood pressure today?  No, I'm fine.  I keep things to a minimum.  I get very agitated, but I've learned to just blow it off.  You need a baby aspirin or something?  No, I'm fine.  Why are they going after you?  I haven't seen this.  Dude, they're not just going after me.  And after yesterday.  You just haven't been hit by this yet. 
[00:15:00]  You will be.  I walked home.  It's a long walk.  It's about a mile and a half.  And I ran into a bunch of people.  And I was looking around because you told me to.  No conversation.  And so far, I have nothing to report.  You know what?  It's a big city.  There's a lot of fine, upstanding people in this city.  Believe me.  Yeah.  But you will start noticing that if you have any type of conflict, you've had conflicts with taxi drivers and stuff like that in the past.  Oh, yeah.  You've had conflicts with people on the skateboard, the rollerblading trip home in the summers. 
[00:15:30]  You've had problems like that.  And you've had open arguments and discussions in the street.  Wait till you get into one of those with somebody that maybe is sympathetic to another group of people that are standing by.  You will absolutely be bitched out and perhaps beaten down.  I've only punched one taxi driver through the little, like, square hole when you're sitting in the back seat.  Yeah.  I slammed a taxi door into a guy who stole my cab once or stole the cab from my girl. 
[00:16:00]  I went, like, old school mafia on that guy, slamming the door into his leg over and over again until he was able to lock the door.  And then I beat up the cab as it was still at the red light.  I did beat up a toll booth once because the lady behind the toll booth wouldn't do the right thing and give me, you know, a ticket in time for me to catch a train.  Well, you haven't had any of these yet.  So I started punching the toll booth.  You haven't had any of these since Obama President Nah.  No, it's always been.  Since Obama President Nah, you'll see. 
[00:16:30]  You'll notice.  Yeah.  Dude, I swear to you.  I'm going to look around again today.  There is a change that I don't think he meant to happen.  And I don't think – and these – Obama President Nah, don't believe me.  Believe me, I don't have any delusions.  Obama – these are Obama's worst enemies.  They don't want – Obama does not want guys like this using his name as a defense against anything.  Why would he yell that? 
[00:17:00]  That wasn't pertinent to the discussion.  It certainly wasn't.  I was discussing a man crossing in front of my vehicle where I had to jam on the brakes and miss my light.  Lights are timed in this city very precisely.  I know exactly how they work.  I know the speed I have to do to get through them, whatever.  Yeah.  So I'm going the normal speed and I'm getting – and there's the green light.  And now I got to jam on the brakes because this idiot decided he wasn't going to cross at the crosswalk.  He was going to cross in the middle street, which is fine when there's no traffic coming and it's 530 in the morning. 
[00:17:30]  I was the only car on the road.  You could cross after I'm done.  After I pass by, cross, whatever.  Well, let's go to the phones, Anthony.  I'm going to go right down.  You mean the packed, loaded phones.  Right.  Let's say hi to Psycho Bob in Baltimore.  Psycho Bob.  Good morning, boys.  Good morning, Bob.  Good morning, Mr. Hollywood.  Hey, that's the next T-shirt you guys got to make.  All right.  On one side it says, Obama, President, nah.  And on the other side it says, which way is north?  Punch it out. 
[00:18:00]  We should get the Obama, President, nah.  Obama, President, nah.  T-shirts, that'd be good.  Nah.  You should have yelled back, sir, who's in the White House is not pertinent to this discussion.  Yes.  Yes.  And in the office it was pointed out to me by Travis that perhaps they were just informing me who had won the election.  Like perhaps they thought maybe I didn't know and they were helping.  So I suggested that maybe I go back, get out of my vehicle, go in the middle of them and say, I do apologize. 
[00:18:30]  I thought you were being racist towards me, but I now understand you were just trying to, ow, ow, ow, ow, help me.  Let's go to Eric in New Jersey.  Eric.  So, morning, boys.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  What's up, Eric?  Anthony, I just wanted to thank and congratulate you for using your medium to bring this to people's attention.  I think it's interesting what's happening.  Every day.  Yes, sir.  I can only thank God, thank the Lord, that he has given me a forum where I can expose these people for what is going on in this country right now since Obama's President, nah. 
[00:19:00]  There is an attitude going on that people can just do things without any repercussions because Obama, President, nah.  Nah.  Got to say that all day now.  Oh, well, Obama, President, nah. 
[00:19:30]  Mark in Jersey, what's up?  These guys have nothing to do with what happened to me between me and a pedestrian.  Race was not involved.  Race was not involved.  This was person A crossing in front of vehicle B driven by person C.  Why didn't you invite them to the show so we can have a little discussion?  Yeah.  Why did he yell?  Yeah, what's wrong with you?  If McCain won, he might have yelled the same thing.  McCain, President, nah.  Hey, B.  You know something?  I would bet the lives of my entire family that that would not have happened. 
[00:20:00]  You'd also bet them on a hand of poker.  What's the hand?  What are you telling me?  What do I got in the pocket?  Am I looking for a straight?  Right.  Am I fishing?  Pocket Aces?  What do I got?  What's the flop look like?  Knowing you, it would be a 2-8 offsuit.  Well, you know, sometimes that flop is good.  I'm all in.  Mark in Jersey, what's going on?  Morning, boys. 
[00:20:30]  Oh, they're not.  Hey, man.  Yes.  Anthony, I totally feel your pain.  I'm a repo man in Newark.  I repoed this gentleman's car the other night.  Yes.  And he told me, Mother Apple, this is going to be one of the last reapers you ever do.  Obama's in office.  This S.A.C. is going to stop.  Yeah.  There's this thing.  And it's not even – I don't want to use the word entitlement because it's not an entitlement issue.  There's an attitude going on.  It's this, okay, it's our time, so all this crap that they considered oppression is going to stop. 
[00:21:00]  But the fact of the matter is this wasn't oppression.  This is living within the boundaries of a civilized society, paying attention to laws and rules and regulations.  And for some reason, you know, when you were penalized for that, it was racism.  I don't know why.  When you commit some kind of crime or you act stupid and you get called out for it, it was always considered racism. 
[00:21:30]  Now, Obama president, nah.  So this doesn't matter anymore.  But these people are going to be so disappointed.  No, they're not.  This isn't what I'm talking about.  This is what transcends what you were saying.  Well, right now I understand that.  But when Obama gets in there and they realize it's business as usual, except it's more democratic business as usual.  Those are the people that pay attention.  I'm talking these people.  Do you think the thugs walk in a sidewalk? 
[00:22:00]  Hold on.  For these people, it's good enough that there's just a black president and they don't care what he ends up doing.  Doesn't even matter.  That's a good point to make.  The thugs aren't going to care in three and a half years.  Right.  Obama's presidency is almost over.  They'll still be Obama president, nah.  Their life doesn't change at all in the next three and a half, four years.  They still feel like.  Still feel that now, I don't care.  I'm crossing in front of your vehicle.  You ain't repoing my car.  Whatever the case is.  And they'll be happy right to the end when they realize Obama's not drastically changing their lives. 
[00:22:30]  Yeah.  Okay.  I'm sick of it.  Okay.  Already.  Well, the phone's just lit.  We're going to take a quick break.  Go right back to the phones.  877-212-ON-A if you want to get in on that.  I hear Jimmy's got some good news.  I'm hearing things.  I'm hearing things.  Maybe he'll share with us after the break.  Ooh.  And some chick killed herself in front of Paula Abdul's mansion.  I know.  Yes.  Crazy, crazy story.  We'll talk about that in a few minutes.  Opie and Anthony. 
[00:23:00]  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony.  We've got to go right back to the phones.  It's 877-212-ON-A.  Let's go to Bill in Jersey.  What's up, Bill?  Oh, Bill.  Hey, good morning, guys.  How are you?  Well, your Devils lost last night, huh?  Yeah.  Thanks for bringing that up.  I wasn't having a bad morning.  I'm wearing my Islander shirt today, so a little hockey talk.  Opie's paying attention.  I certainly am, Anthony.  I certainly am.  Learie Day.  Rangers beat Devils 5-2.  Go ahead, Bill.  Are you just paying attention or just trying to get Anthony off topic? 
[00:23:30]  No, I love it, actually.  I really love this crap.  I don't know why.  I probably should be sitting him down and going, look, this isn't a good thing that you're doing.  No, it is.  It's just me.  Why can't I?  Why the hell can't I just confront people that are being dummies to me without having this sidewalk race war happen?  Some guy was...  Excuse me.  I'm sorry.  Go ahead.  But if you know, if you start up, you're going to be the one flagged a racist, you know? 
[00:24:00]  Of course.  Of course.  Quick story.  I work for this company.  We had this black girl.  She constantly showed up late, always disciplined, always in trouble.  We got this new guy coming from outside, black boss.  She thought her ass wasn't going to stink.  She was going to be the new golden child.  The whole thing.  Well, he smacked her down harder than the white boss did.  And, you know, all of a sudden it wasn't racist, which she claimed it was with the white boss. 
[00:24:30]  Yeah, see?  All right.  There you go.  And I think that's...  I think the Obama reaction is going to be the same thing.  I hope, anyway.  I hope Obama really, like, calls out people that are being stupid.  I think you're absolutely right that people are just taking him for his color and then not his points.  And I'm sure he doesn't want any of this.  Yeah, they're using the fact that Obama President, nah, to, you know, just be thugs. 
[00:25:00]  Obama's young and all, but he seems like a square.  Good.  He really does seem like a square.  Well, if he hasn't had any interns by now, I'm sure he is.  Yeah, there you go.  Oh, yeah, right.  You think he's going to, you know, chance that intern thing?  You see Michelle Obama?  You think she's going to put up with it like Hillary did?  Are you kidding me?  No, she'll probably shoot him.  Keep up the good work, guys.  Punch it out.  She'll scratch his eyes right out.  Steve, New Hampshire, how are you, buddy?  Hey, what's going on?  What's up, Steve? 
[00:25:30]  Hey, Anthony.  Yeah.  You know, at first I was kind of laughing at your story, and then I legitimately got very angry  at what exactly happened.  People are so dumb.  Yeah, it got me angry, too.  I mean, these guys had nothing to do with the situation that I was yelling at this guy  for running, you know, walking in front of my vehicle.  He did walk.  He was slowly crossing the street right in front of me.  It wasn't one of those little jogs, like, I can make it kind of a thing. 
[00:26:00]  So I called him out on it, and then, you know, you get five thugs on the sidewalk, decide  to chime in and say, Obama, President, nah.  So what?  That means anyone of color can cross in front of white people's vehicles and hopefully not  get hit?  And we're supposed to jam on the brakes, even though, you know, I had the light?  There wasn't even a light.  I was in between lights, and he's crossing.  I mean, it's just, it was despicable.  It made me so goddamn angry. 
[00:26:30]  All right, let's go to Tom in Illinois.  Tom, how are you?  Good, what's going on, guys?  What's up, Tom?  Hey, I'm a firefighter paramedic.  I was working my part-time gig one day, probably a day or two after the election, and we took  a little, well, Monday girl of color to the hospital, and we have teddy bears on the  rigs, you know, to make sure that, you know, if they're upset or scared, so we give them  a teddy bear to play with.  I had two teddy bears.  I had a brown one and a white one, and I gave this little black girl the white teddy 
[00:27:00]  bear.  I pulled them both out, and I gave it to her, and she looked at me, like, disgusted at  me, and goes, I don't want no white teddy bear.  Wow.  And she's six years old, raising the state, and I gave her a white teddy bear instead  of the brown one.  But it's not a doll.  It's an animal.  Yeah, it's just a...  Well, exactly, but apparently she doesn't want a white teddy bear.  Jesus.  Well, next time you'll give the brown one to the black girl, you racist.  Yeah, you're a racist.  Obama president, nah.  All right, let's go to...  Obama park ranger, nah. 
[00:27:30]  Well, let's talk to Everett in Canada.  Everett?  What's up, man?  Good morning, my boys.  Good morning, Everett.  I just wanted to say, Anthony, you should be maybe just a little more understanding.  Those boys aren't very edumacated.  See, they're real racist in Canada.  We learned this recently.  Yeah, we just learned that.  I love you guys.  They are really bad.  Have a wonderful day, Anthony.  I'm just trying to stress the point, too, because I know people jump to conclusions, 
[00:28:00]  especially when I start yapping, that this started out as just some guy crossing in front  of me.  This wasn't...  Look at this.  Yeah.  As I have to watch on the news, these two officers that were gunned down in the city,  three gentlemen that are on trial for it just disgusts me.  Anyway, I just want to make a point.  You know, this was a guy crossing in front of my car that I started yelling at, that these 
[00:28:30]  five thugs decided they had to get involved by pointing out to me who the president-elect  was and how, you know, perhaps I have a problem that this man was walking in front of my moving  vehicle.  Ugh.  But they didn't know you were a white guy, either.  Oh, yeah.  My window is down.  No, I mean the person that, you know, was walking in front of you.  No, no.  That's why.  It wasn't a...  Jesus Christ.  There's just things happening all over the place.  Apparently in Mastic...  Oh, I got that story. 
[00:29:00]  You got that story?  Well, Mastic is supposed to be a lovely, lovely little town, remember?  Do we have the Mastic moment, Ben?  This, uh, there is something going on.  There are tensions going on right now, um, that we haven't seen in a while.  Maybe they were there, but now they're bubbling up to the surface because Obama president, nah.  And, uh, wow.  Because now there's been a resurgence of KKK literature. 
[00:29:30]  They're looking for people that are putting KKK flyers on people's windshields.  There's, uh, racial epithets being spray-painted on people's cars.  That's the Mastic story.  Uh, there's just...  There's the Obama president, nah.  Things happening in the streets of Manhattan.  I'm being bumped by people.  Apparently Kenny had a little episode.  Things just happen.  Yeah.  Well, we got a story out of Mastic.  I wanted to turn it into a Mastic moment. 
[00:30:00]  That's why.  Aw.  I got it over here.  And now it's time for a Mastic moment.  As Opie and Anthony take a glorious look at this majestic Long Island community.  Well, the Secret Service is investigating a case of racist graffiti on Long Island.  Racial epithets were found scrawled all over cars in Mastic.  One of those messages referred to President-elect Barack Obama.  Police say it's not necessarily a hate crime, but residents describe the vandalism as hateful. 
[00:30:30]  Why would you do that?  If that's your business, you want to be racist, that's your business.  Don't go and analyze people's vehicles and stuff.  People got to learn that we all live together.  Just get along.  But the right stuff like that on trucks is not cool at all.  Now, this comes just days after seven Long Island high school students were charged with stabbing a man to death  because the police say that the kids thought he looked Hispanic.  And that was a bird's eye view into the scenic town we hold close to our hearts. 
[00:31:00]  A Mastic moment on the Opie and Anthony show.  A lot of crap happens in Mastic.  Oh, it certainly does.  But the news didn't want to use the word kill, I guess.  Really?  Yeah, that's what it said.  The word kill was part of that graffiti.  Yeah, the Secret Service was involved.  They were brought out.  They questioned a bunch of people.  It was on many cars out there?  Yeah, like three dozen, I believe. 
[00:31:30]  Three dozen cars had either racial epithets or some kind of other graffiti spray-painted on their cars.  That doesn't really seem like any kind of organized movement.  Right.  It seems like some disgruntled people.  Of course.  Let's say hi to Tom from the NYPD.  What's up, Tom?  Hey, how you doing, guys?  Pretty good, man.  Hey, this Obama story, I felt compelled to call you guys  because a buddy of mine in my prison had a car stopping.  This guy who had one headlight out. 
[00:32:00]  And he approaches the vehicle, discovers that it's going to be a black.  Approaches the driver, he's like, oh, let me see your license, registration, insurance card.  The driver turns around and says, you know, this crap, it's going to happen.  Obama's in office, blah, blah, blah.  So my buddy turns around and he's like, why is Obama going to be a mechanic and fix your headlight?  What's up, guys?  That's a good one.  He's going to fix your headlight.  Anyone who says anything about Obama to a cop is just going to get some smart-ass answer like that.  Of course they are.  Why would you say that to a cop? 
[00:32:30]  Right.  Cops are full of those little jabs.  Why did Obama register your car on time?  Because you didn't.  Out of the vehicle.  You're not going to win, say that to a cop.  The NYPD is like a seasoned comic.  They know how to deal with hecklers.  You know the seasoned comic, he's sitting up there and you think you're going to be funny  with your dumb one line and the comic just destroys you because he's been doing this for a year.  Yeah, the NYPD.  They know how to do the crowd work.  Same way, man.  They go for the throat relatively quickly. 
[00:33:00]  Hey, be more funny.  Next thing you know, you've got a nightstick in your teeth.  Jesus, that was an atomic bomb.  Let's go to Gary in Kansas.  Gary.  Yeah.  What's up, Gary?  What's up, man?  Hey, this is Gary in Kansas.  I'm a member of the Aryan Brotherhood.  And I'd like to tell Ant that we'd like to invite him to join.  The Aryan Brotherhood.  I believe my position pretty much makes it so I can't join certain organizations. 
[00:33:30]  You know.  I could spout out my opinions.  Certain organizations, why is that?  We hear what you're saying and we all know what you're saying.  I can.  We believe in what you're preaching, brother.  We hear it.  We all talk about it.  Everybody in the Aryan Brotherhood talks about Antony on the Opie and Antony Show.  We love you, man.  We do.  We do all hear it, Antony.  Well, you know, Opie, as long as we're hitting an audience.  What are you saying, Gary?  Sir, we look at you.  We look at you as kind of a leader of the Aryan Brotherhood. 
[00:34:00]  Oh.  By proxy.  Yeah.  How about that?  Well, send me some literature.  What can I say?  Why?  How many copies of the same stuff do you need?  We both certainly will.  Send me some literature.  Why, are you going to proofread it?  This is wrong.  This happened in 1933.  No, no, no.  He looked at two white women, not one.  Yeah.  All right.  Thank you, Gary.  We've got to cut you off.  All right.  Hey.  We've got Nick DiPaolo on the line. 
[00:34:30]  Nick, how are you, buddy?  I'm downstairs in a lobby.  Yeah.  Come on up.  Well, the guy down here doesn't have me on the...  How did Nick not get on the list?  Well, I'll tell you how.  I let my agent book this for two weeks ago.  All right.  We'll send someone down.  You knew I was coming, right?  No.  You didn't?  No.  Really?  Steve, Nick's down there.  Unbelievable.  All right.  We'll go get you.  All right.  Thanks.  Why would we know anything? 
[00:35:00]  All right.  Let's say hi to Mark and Mastic.  Mark.  Hey, what's going on, my boys?  Hey, man.  Racial tension has always been a thing in Mastic, but now the brothers are starting to stare  us down.  Oh, yeah?  Oh, yeah.  You go to the store, it's like they're watching you like you're the thief now.  But, yeah.  Shotgun News has a special 10,000 rounds of .223, $199.  Obama got in.  I got my ammo. 
[00:35:30]  All right.  Well, they are thinking about putting a 500% tax on ammo.  That's why.  A lot of things.  I read so many articles about how gun stores are just packed with people buying weapons  that they don't think they're going to be able to get because of the restrictions that  the Democrats are going to put on them.  Tax my gas, tax my cigarettes, tax my ammo.  And they're just saying, oh, that's ridiculous.  This isn't even a priority with him.  I wouldn't worry about it.  Blah, blah, blah.  All right. 
[00:36:00]  Let's keep moving on here.  The phones are just lit.  Phil, New York, how are you?  Phil.  Very good.  How are you?  Well, the Knicks beat the Grizzlies.  I'm paying attention.  I'm starting to think I might have to start following the Knicks again.  I don't know.  I wouldn't waste my time.  I have a hypothetical situation that could have occurred here.  Yeah.  Let's just say you had a loaded pistol in your vehicle yesterday, or rather this morning,  and the boy did find a bottle to throw at your car.  What would have happened?  Nothing.  That isn't grounds for deadly physical force, sir. 
[00:36:30]  If he broke the bottle on your head, could you then?  Being thrown at me and breaking on my head doesn't show intent.  It could have been a lucky shot, you know, as far as throwing the bottle.  The rules for deadly physical force, very, very strict.  You really have to know what you're doing and be very up on them before you just start  brandishing and firing rounds off, sir.  Are you showing responsibility? 
[00:37:00]  Well, in those situations, look.  Kind of weird.  The last thing anyone wants to do is turn anything into a gunfight, for Christ's sake.  The thing is, I was discussing this man's error with walking in front of my car, and then  I was confronted by thugs on a sidewalk that had nothing to do with the situation.  That's what upset me.  It needn't have escalated into anything further than it did escalate into, which was name  calling and taunting on the street. 
[00:37:30]  That was it.  But, but I'm just, like I said, I'm noticing this trend where people are using Obama as  an excuse for just horrid behavior.  Let's say hi to Tom.  Tom, you're on the Opie and Anthony show.  What up, fellas?  What's up?  Hey, I had a little incident at the car wash a couple days ago.  I was washing my boat.  I got a nice bass boat, and I was washing it, getting ready for the winter.  And a guy, a black guy pushing a shopping carriage walked up to me. 
[00:38:00]  Now, I was in Brockton.  You guys used to work in Boston.  You know Brockton.  Brockton, yes.  And I'm like, oh, here we go.  I'm about to get, I got a pocket full of quarters.  Here we go.  Hey, man, now that Barack Obama president, I'm going to be able to afford me one of them  boats someday.  The guy's pushing a shopping carriage.  You know what I mean?  He's looking for help.  Yeah, but you're not exactly using a stable example.  Really?  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, really. 
[00:38:30]  Thank you.  I appreciate it.  Let's go to Lauren in New York.  Lauren, how are you?  That's the same type of a bum that would have said I'm having wings put on this thing.  Yeah.  I'm going to fly it somewhere.  Hey, wait, I think these are the guys that yelled at me this morning on Channel 5.  Huh?  Hello?  Oh, my God.  I guess they were going to...  Yes, Lauren, go ahead.  Hi, I was driving on one of the main streets here in Rockaway, and a black lady in an X5 was  pulled up next to me.  I pulled out of my window just to tell her a back door where her child was, was open.  She proceeded to pull down her window, yelled at me, damn whitey, and then threw a rock 
[00:39:00]  or something hard at my car.  I think people are starting to make up these stories now.  I think the entitlement thing is going through the head.  No, no, no.  Things are happening.  I'll give you a little story that happened yesterday while I was pulling into the bank  parking lot.  All right.  This obviously deranged man was walking very slowly in front of my vehicle.  I had pulled in off the expressway service road into my bank parking lot, and I couldn't  move any further now because this idiot is walking slowly in front of me. 
[00:39:30]  Another man went to pull behind me.  Now he's stuck on the service road still because he can't pull into the parking lot the full  way because I got this idiot in front of me.  So I pull over as much as I can so the guy behind me can get past me.  It's the concept of going around.  People don't seem to understand.  Go around.  It's easy.  You just go around a vehicle.  Know the parameters of your car and use them and fit through a spot that I left you to go  around me.  I'll always do that.  If I have to make a left, I'll pull over as far left as I can so people can get around 
[00:40:00]  my right.  Whatever happens, I'll leave you room to get around me if I have to stop for any reason.  This guy didn't go around.  So someone pulls out of a parking space.  I go, oh, I'll take that spot.  Deranged man, finally out of my way.  I start moving.  I hear, bam, from behind me.  Guy pulls up next to me.  It's a white guy.  Rolls his window down.  I roll mine down.  I go, excuse me, and he starts saying, like, what were you doing or you blocked me or something 
[00:40:30]  like that, and I go, there was someone in front of my car.  I go, now I'm parking.  I left you room to go around.  Do you know the concept of going around?  And he tries this little move where he's taking his hands and kind of lowering them like, relax.  Hey, everything's fine.  I mean, this, this, this, uh, uh, uh, just trying to placate me.  Yeah.  Trying to like, hey, it's okay.  Meanwhile, I didn't beep.  I wasn't the one that rolled the window down to have a discussion with me. 
[00:41:00]  I left him room to go around.  Take his advice.  Everything's going to be...  No, he was an idiot.  I'm just, I will call out idiots wherever they are.  I've never actually seen somebody unravel before.  It's wonderful, isn't it, Jimmy?  Take notes.  It'll make a great chapter in the book.  It's also unimportant.  There are more...  No, it's not unimportant.  They are.  They will not learn.  My job is to educate.  Dude, they're not going to learn anything.  I'm educating.  You know what's great about Anthony and his stories? 
[00:41:30]  He probably leaves his house for a total of 20 minutes a day.  It's just a disaster every time.  You're right.  Because if you know this show, Anthony doesn't really leave his surroundings often.  I leave to get, um, uh, beer and go to the gun range.  You take a deep breath before you leave your house going, all right.  Sometimes.  This is going to be in a...  It's like, here we go again.  It's only 20 minutes, but I know something will happen.  Some idiot's going to do something stupid.  Oh, please.  It just is.  Yeah.  And could people... 
[00:42:00]  Can people...  Here's just one more thing.  I got to get off my chest.  I got to...  Could people please pass cops on the road?  If a cop is doing 55 on the road, the cop, first of all, here's the mindset of the police  officer.  Let me give you a little mindset of the cop.  All right.  Wherever he's going, unless his light's in siren on, he don't want to get there that  fast.  He really is not in a rush.  Because it's probably somewhere he really doesn't want to be. 
[00:42:30]  Right.  So when he's in his car and he's driving, he's not going to be speeding.  He's just doing the speed limit.  That's driving where he wants to go.  If he's in the middle lane and you're in the left lane, you can pass him.  You can do 58.  That would be speeding.  You can do 60.  That would be speeding.  Pass the cop.  That would be speeding.  No.  He's not going to pull you over.  Don't blast by him at 80.  Don't do anything like that.  Don't get on his ass.  But for the love of Christ, you are allowed to pass a police officer. 
[00:43:00]  Danny's got a comment on this one.  Just to tag on to that, can we also stop jamming on our brakes because a cop has already pulled  someone over?  Oh, that is just every day.  Like he's not going to be like, oh, forget you.  I have to go after this guy.  I'm getting this one now.  Just relax.  I got a better fish on the line.  Those cops are all knowing.  Even though they're writing a ticket, they see you speeding.  Oh, I know.  And they're going to get you next.  Don't blast by him at 80.  But the thing is, you're allowed to pass the cop. 
[00:43:30]  You know how much worse it looks when you don't pass the cop?  You're just sitting there on his quarter panel, just waiting for him to leave.  Move!  All right.  We're going to take a break.  Nick DePaul is joining the program next.  I hear he got into it with Shepard Smith on TV last night or maybe a couple of days ago.  Was it last night?  Oh, yeah.  Last night?  Okay.  We'll talk to him about that.  Paul Abdul.  Wow.  Yeah.  I think she woke up to like a dead body outside our house. 
[00:44:00]  Yeah.  One of the papers actually had the headline.  This girl was a Suez Idol.  Oh, no.  And they put Idol in quotation.  Right, right.  And Suez Idol.  That's cute.  Because she was an American Idol contestant.  And what we have that other stations will not have for you today is her American Idol audition.  Oh.  She auditioned for American Idol.  She made it on TV.  And I'm sure they gave her really good reviews and she made it onto Hollywood Dog and everything 
[00:44:30]  was fine.  And she was a huge Paul Abdul fan so she decided to kill herself outside Paul Abdul's mansion.  It's a wonderful story.  Yes, Jimmy.  I'm heading to Rhode Island tonight for my final book signing next to Boston.  So I'll be up there at 6 o'clock at Borders at Providence on Providence Road.  I don't know.  It's not on the list.  Do you or do you not have good news for us today?  Possibly.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  I'm happy.  All right.  We'll talk about that as well. 
[00:45:00]  How did you find out?  Kenny told me and then told me to not tell you that I knew.  He's just the worst.  Just the worst.  Kenny told me the whole thing and then he goes, but he's very excited so make believe  that I didn't tell you.  He can't keep his mouth shut.  The worst.  Blabber mouth.  As soon as he said that, I'm like, of course I'm going to say something, Kenny.  But make believe, okay?  Because he wants to tell you himself. 
[00:45:30]  What am I, retarded?  I'm really irritated.  Don't be irritated.  No, that he would say don't tell.  Who cares?  But everyone does that.  I know.  Everyone does that dumb thing.  Well, you know, I'm going to tell you something, but make believe I didn't tell you.  It's so stupid.  You have a bunch of tattletail-y blabber mouths around.  Because everyone likes to have a little snippet of knowledge.  Look what I know that you don't.  Yeah, but now I'm going to tell you, but make believe you didn't hear it when the real person  tells you.  People tell me things that they're concerned I'm going to tell other people.  And I forget, like two seconds after they tell me, I'm so uninterested in what they say. 
[00:46:00]  Don't worry.  I'm not telling anybody.  It's not that thrilling.  It's only a five-minute ride, but Kenny told me the whole thing.  And it ends with, but let him tell you himself, because he's very excited.  Nothing.  You all right, Kenny?  Yeah.  Are you just, oh, you don't know what we were just talking about?  You're all confused.  All right, we'll explain it to Kenny next.  Opie and Anthony. 
[00:46:30]  They must have urgent things to say, Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Very important things.  877-212-ONA.  Man, the phones have been lit ever since this Obama thing.  Yeah.  Ever since the election.  Yeah, it's very important.  Yeah.  One of those things people want to talk about.  I seem to be in a tizzy every day from things happening. 
[00:47:00]  My eyes are open.  And I see things happening out there on the streets.  I bet you Nick sees things happening on the streets, too.  Yeah, I think we all do.  You just got to, you know, just got to look in the right spots.  You got to say, not take any guff.  Yeah.  I was seeing that stuff during the Carter administration.  Was that during the Carter administration?  I saw it coming in the 70s.  Yeah.  Just a little altercations here and there.  Both sides. 
[00:47:30]  You know, both sides of the racial boundary.  Yeah.  You got that, that the thugs shout me down in the street as I'm trying to have a discussion  with a gentleman walking in front of my vehicle.  Well, and then you got, you know, the situation in Mastic where people are spray painting things  on people's cars.  What'd the guy say?  Secret service involved.  What'd the guy say who was actually crossing?  Nothing?  Nothing.  He pointed at the light.  And I think his point that he was trying to make, and this annoys the crap out of me.  I don't care what the hell the situation is.  He was pointing at the light, which was now red because I had to stop to let him past. 
[00:48:00]  Yeah.  Then it turns red.  Yeah.  He pointed at the light and goes, where are you going anyway?  Like as if I was inconveniencing him to get to a red light.  It's like, no, dummy.  The light was green.  That's why also, like if I'm in a little bit of traffic and someone pulls in front of  me and then starts going a lot slower than they were before they pulled in front of me,  and then we get stuck at a red light.  It's like, well, you're at a red light. 
[00:48:30]  It's like, yeah, but I wouldn't have been if you didn't pull in front of me, dummy.  I think we're soulmates.  I swear to God.  Oh, I get so aggravated with that.  You pass somebody.  You finally get past them, and the light turns red, and you're stuck, and they give you this  look in the mirror.  Like I look in the mirror to look at his face, and they smile.  I'm like, eh, see?  You got stuck at the light anyway.  No, that was your fault.  You put me here, idiot.  You're like me, man.  Nick DiPaolo in studio.  It wasn't supposed to be, but thank you.  It's all good.  Don't even worry about it.  NickDip.com. 
[00:49:00]  My new agent did a real bang-up job on this one.  I hope he's listening.  Good guy, actually, but some miscommunication.  No biggie.  Where were we at?  So we discussed that.  We got to talk about the Paul Abdul thing.  Jimmy's got really good news that Kenny already blew, but Anthony doesn't know.  I haven't heard it, so it's news to me.  So it'll be nice new news for Anthony.  Yes.  It's good news, but I'm so negative.  Why are you negative?  Because he's a negative jelly.  Kenny even said that you are very happy and excited. 
[00:49:30]  I am.  The new book hit the bestseller list.  It won't be out for another week and a half.  What?  Yeah, I'm bummed because it's number 13 out of 15, but I'm happy because it outsold the  first one.  There's just more competition now.  You're on the bestseller list.  Another bestseller.  And Kenny goes, four Obama books.  But Kenny goes, yeah, Jimmy would have done better, but there's four Obama books on the  bestseller list.  Stupid O'Reilly has one.  Yeah.  I'm going to keep you with Bill O'Reilly.  Yeah. 
[00:50:00]  What's the matter with O'Reilly?  I love him.  He really loves O'Reilly.  He's fine.  He has the balls to point out what Anthony was just talking about.  There you go.  He'll go there a little bit.  That's the only reason.  You know what I mean?  And I'm not becoming like a Fox sycophant.  A lot of people will not go to those places.  You know, I mean, everyone, we've been walking on eggshells for so long.  Everyone's afraid to just speak about what is happening in their day-to-day lives that  might be racial or racist or just whatever it was. 
[00:50:30]  Today, what happened to me is a prime example of this.  I just conveyed a story that happened in the street.  I didn't – I wasn't bringing up some imaginary thing.  It wasn't a bit.  It wasn't something that anyone could call me out on.  This is what happened to me.  Well, yeah, you and a million other people.  Yeah.  In the last two weeks.  I mean, it just – it's been happening.  I've been noticing.  I get emails.  I get things.  These are things that I haven't been hearing about in a while.  And now they're happening. 
[00:51:00]  So what am I supposed to do?  Not talk about them?  Oh, was I human?  This is his ass nightmare.  I love it.  I just love it.  It really is your nightmare.  You know something, though?  Call me Kreskin because I just saw it coming.  You certainly did.  I saw it coming.  You certainly did.  I said before he was elected, I said, this is what's going to happen.  There's going to be this issue where black people that perhaps aren't hardworking,  assimilating to our civilized society, the thugs on the street I'm talking about, 
[00:51:30]  are going to have this attitude that they think now they're going to be able to get away  with these things, where they were getting arrested, where now I'll just walk in front  of your vehicle.  But they're still going to get arrested for doing stupid stuff.  Yeah, but they don't think they are.  I think once Obama gets in, it's a get-out-of-jail-free card.  I was just about to go to you, Malik, and you hang up on me.  Malik's a little mad, and he says, like, don't judge all black people because of what's  happening here.  Oh, Jesus.  I want Malik to at least say it.  I'm not. 
[00:52:00]  Maybe he'll call back.  But you know what's more angering about it?  He's biracial.  He's not black.  He's biracial.  That's true.  You understand?  Yes.  One of his parents is white.  Are we that really?  Pure, pure lily white.  Let's stop with this.  And I actually like, I like what I've seen from him.  And I don't get the, everybody, you know, sit on the right like he's Eric.  I don't get that.  He seems like kind of a nice guy.  Yeah.  And, you know, let's give him a chance and stuff.  But let's, you know.  It's going to be tough.  If he was a hip-hop or an athlete, you'd think they'd be calling him black? 
[00:52:30]  They'd be.  Yeah.  They'd be outcast.  Yeah, Tiger Woods.  Look, if you caught him banging your chick, you wouldn't only be half mad at him.  It is one of these situations where, you know, he's half white, half black.  But the black people just see it as, you know.  You're going to have two black parents to be black.  Yeah, yeah.  See?  I know you get little rules, an ounce of black blood, and it makes you black.  Yeah, yeah.  You can play with that.  I know.  I got Earl all mad when I called up Ron and Fez one day and said, 
[00:53:00]  but I just want to say that I'm very happy that we've elected our first half white president.  Yeah.  And he was all annoyed.  It rained on his little parade.  Well, that's logic and reason.  We can't do that today.  It's going to be all about emotion and not.  Yep.  Let's go to knee-jerk reactions to things people are saying.  It's just, it makes sense.  I'm looking at some property in Ireland.  Let's say hi to Jared.  It's a nice, bonny place.  Yeah.  Let's go to Jared in Boston.  Jared, how are you?  Hey, Rick.  I am well. 
[00:53:30]  Thank you, boys.  Anthony, did you really mean to say that blacks are assimilating into society?  Or did you mean something else?  Like, society.  Society.  Yeah, you said society wrong.  I know.  You should know that by now.  I just, it just, it annoys me.  And for a thug on the street, and that's what these five youngsters walking down the street were.  They had nothing to do with the situation I was dealing with this morning with this gentleman  that crossed in front of my vehicle. 
[00:54:00]  Well, nothing to do with it, except race.  They were the same race as the guy.  If I was yelling at a white guy, they would not have joined in.  It was race.  They were racially driven to protect this guy that just walked in front of my vehicle,  and I called him out on it in a completely non-racial way.  They brought race into it.  And these thugs having this feeling that they can now be further from society and still be able to be and have to be accepted is ridiculous. 
[00:54:30]  They should look at what Obama did.  Yeah.  The guy went to school, educated himself, worked himself up, and now look, President of the United States.  So, what?  You can't do that?  You can't stay in school?  You can't go to class and learn something, go to college, whatever it takes to become president. 
[00:55:00]  Apparently, you can.  So, what are you doing?  What are you doing?  Instead of doing that, instead of seeing, wow, there's a black president.  If I work hard, maybe I can succeed in this society.  It's, no, hey, Obama president, nah.  Well, that's how they're doing it.  They're doing exactly what you just said.  Oh, that's going to do it?  Yeah, they now...  You know something?  That ain't going to do it.  Let's say hi to Nick in New York.  Nick, how are you?  Pretty good.  Hey, good morning, boys.  What's up, Nick?  Hey, my girlfriend, she's an immigration enforcement agent in New York, and apparently they're deporting this person from Kenya. 
[00:55:30]  And he made a statement to them that apparently he's going to be coming back to the United States and laughing their faces because Obama's going to be in office, and he's going to change everything.  Yeah, he'll be wearing a marathon suit when he does.  Yeah.  So, he thinks he could come back into America because Obama's president?  Exactly.  He thinks, you know, he's going to let everybody come back in or whoever's illegal in the United States to stay in the country and, you know, do what they want. 
[00:56:00]  Well, obviously, he's going to be wrong.  You sure?  All right.  Thank you.  Hey, Nick DiPaolo in studio.  I got some audio in front of me.  You and Shepard Smith had a little something-something going on yesterday?  No biggie.  I mean, it's funny.  We're living in weird times.  We really are.  Yeah.  I mean, I do this.  They have this show called The Strategy Room.  It's one of those streaming shows from, like, 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.  And a different, like, Fox on-air personality usually hosts every hour.  They change. 
[00:56:30]  And then once in a while, a guy like Shep will come in.  It's kind of cool meeting all these people, you know.  They have cots set up over there for those people.  I know.  It's like any time you turn it on.  Those people are never not on the air.  I know.  I know.  So, yeah.  I mean, I was sitting there.  Judge Napolitano was hosting.  And, you know, he asked me about, well, why did McCain lose this?  And I said, well, the media, the mainstream media was in the tank for Barack.  And Shep went nuts.  It was true, though.  Well, even liberals are admitting to that since the thing's over. 
[00:57:00]  But he went nuts.  And it's kind of ironic.  I mean, I understand if it was Brian Williams.  Yeah, yeah.  You know what I'm saying?  And that's who I was talking about.  And, you know, I pointed out NBC, ABC, CBS, even the magazines like Newsweek.  Fox is the last station I just pointed out for.  Yeah, that's not what was implied.  And he went cuckoo.  I mean, he's been known, I guess.  What's funny about it, it's the first time.  And he did kind of, I really stunk at defending my position.  I was thrown by his reaction, and it kind of flustered me. 
[00:57:30]  Yeah, yeah.  But I wanted to make the bigger point.  I wasn't just talking about news.  I was talking about whether it's movies, sitcoms, commercials, how I wanted to get into.  There's a liberal undertone to all of it.  Sure.  For the last 20 years, they've been hammering kids.  And, you know, white is unhip, and black is cool.  That was my bigger point that I didn't even get to.  So, I mean, I didn't do that well in the argument.  He just unloaded on you.  But he, yeah, because he went nuts.  And I was like, I'm sitting there.  And, you know, Jimmy from Tough Crowd, I usually, you know. 
[00:58:00]  Yeah.  It was the best of them.  We all know that, Nick.  But it actually made me look mature.  He's going nuts.  And I'm literally, I got my hands, my fingers.  What are you doing?  Your hands folded just, oh, shit.  And he went cuckoo.  And you know what, though?  Again, and I don't really blame him, because I guess I'm questioning what he does for a living.  Yeah, perhaps that was it.  It's like taking it personally.  He's taking this very personally.  Yeah, and you know what?  It's like, it was no biggie to me. 
[00:58:30]  And then you come home.  My wife's like, it's all over YouTube.  And, you know, I'm like.  Oh, really?  You're a YouTube star?  Yeah, they had like 40,000 hits.  Nice.  Well, let's listen to the audio.  I didn't, again, I don't hold it against him.  If I was like in his seat, I might have done the same thing, because I'm questioning what he does.  I wasn't.  Yeah, the integrity of what he does, I guess.  But I didn't know that he included himself with CBS, CNN.  Yeah, yeah.  But whatever.  All right, let's listen to this.  George Bush's popularity is the lowest since they've been taking the polls. 
[00:59:00]  And those who disagree with them are the highest ratings of any president in history.  Did that have something to do with it, Mr. DePaulo?  Absolutely.  But the mainstream media being so in the tank.  Oh, please.  For Obama.  That's preposterous.  Why?  Well, why?  Yeah, it's like, why?  Wait a minute.  That's not the Nick we're used to.  Well, why?  Well, it's like, no, but I yell back, but it's not on the clip.  We started, you know, I started yelling back, but he goes a little nuts.  I love the why.  Well, why?  That's preposterous. 
[00:59:30]  Why?  What do you mean the mainstream media wasn't the tank?  The mainstream media reflected what was happening in this nation.  It did not drive it.  The blogs didn't drive this movement.  The media didn't drive this movement.  Barack Obama did not lose this election.  It was his to lose.  It was not John McCain's to win.  The Republicans had no shot unless the Democrats gave it to him, and they didn't.  And to blame the media is a cop-out and ridiculous.  We are always here to be blamed for people like you who enjoy that activity. 
[01:00:00]  We always will be.  When the Democrats lost last time, it was our fault.  When the Republicans lost this time, it's our fault.  It's not.  The nation was changing.  Barack Obama did not lose.  Therefore, John McCain did, and that's it.  How about that?  The media reflects the movement of the people at the time they captured it.  The media has been liberal since its inception.  It's years and years of pounding.  How did John McCain, how did George Bush win twice?  It's years and years of pounding.  I don't know.  Karl Rove is a genius, I guess. 
[01:00:30]  You know what?  Listen to this pussy, Shepard.  These guys, and I like Fox, but they don't like to admit that they have any bias whatsoever.  Had you separated Fox from that, he probably wouldn't have got so mad.  But they don't like to admit that they do drive things, and they do push things.  Of course they do.  The same way they showed the Imus clip 500 times more than they showed Jesse Jackson dropping the N-bomb on their own network.  Yes.  They do drive things.  Although Fox is not pro-Obama.  They absolutely were pro-Obama.  But I don't think that's why he won, but just admit that that's what they were. 
[01:01:00]  CNN was, you know, they seemed like they were on Obama's payroll for the way they were pushing him.  They certainly pushed him along.  It was criticism.  It didn't hurt what they were doing.  And I did a horrible job, like I said, of defending my point, because I'm the one who brought up NBC, CBS, ABC.  But I was talking about the bigger picture, from Hollywood movies to commercial.  You know what I mean?  That message is an undertone, a liberal undertone to all that crap.  And kids, white kids, they have no identity anymore. 
[01:01:30]  And all they see is how it's unhip, and it's time for, you know, the old crusty white guy to get out of the White House.  It's time for, I mean, that wasn't the sole reason, you know?  But like I said, I was so shocked at his overreaction.  I believe that he has seen me, like, on Tough Crowd.  You see what I'm saying?  He's like, that guy's a bully, and I can't stand.  It seemed kind of, it got a little more personal.  It was like, you know what I mean, misdirected.  I love this first response.  That's preposterous.  That's poppycock, Mr. DiPaolo. 
[01:02:00]  But I still, look, like I said, it didn't bother me.  You know, I like a heated argument.  And you know what, if I was Shepard Smith, I might have done the same thing.  If somebody's questioning my integrity.  So I don't hold it, you know.  Just don't take Shep's parking spot.  Apparently.  Yeah, he doesn't like going to take it.  He'll run right into you.  Oh, yeah.  He would have ran over those utes this morning, Eric.  Oh, of course he would have.  What's the endorsement?  You know, the mainstream media didn't drive it.  How many, what percentage of the mainstream media endorsed Obama? 
[01:02:30]  Right.  Newspapers and stuff like that.  You can tell me that's 50-50.  How about the Los Angeles Times that wouldn't release the videotape that they were given  of Obama toasting and hanging out with the known terrorists from the past?  Well, how about in the New York Times, first they write that article.  Members were saying that McCain was having an affair with no credibility whatsoever.  And then Obama does his editorial and McCain answers with his editorial and they don't  publish it because it wasn't up to New York Times standards.  I mean, Jesus, how much more evidence do you need? 
[01:03:00]  And that was just a couple examples.  The Palin story came out that she never, she actually never had that where she didn't  know if Africa was a continent or a country.  I know, I know.  That never happened.  That never happened.  And today there was something in the paper that said, yeah, that was just somebody saying  it and they ran, the press ran with it without checking.  And it turns out, she was never confused as to that.  You know, she's probably confused with a lot of other things.  She comes off like a ditzy bitch.  Yeah.  But, you know, that's just another thing. 
[01:03:30]  They don't check.  A lot of these news organizations, they get the news from these blogs and people that are  just typing away in their basement.  Well, if it goes against their political ideology, they'll do back checks.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  They'll bet the hell out of it.  But if it's something like that, like you said, makes Palin look like an idiot or somebody  they despise, let's just let it roll, baby.  If it's fake, we'll just retract it later.  So, I mean, what I said was nothing that anybody hasn't said a zillion times.  Like I said, there's people on the left who said, yeah, after this election, they even  admitted it's been a little while.  They own the media. 
[01:04:00]  Look at Saturday Night Live.  Week after week, they pounded Palin and McCain.  And that has an effect, too, absolutely.  And it does have an effect.  Absolutely.  If you can make someone look goofy and stupid, people are going to be like, the person's  goofy and stupid.  I remember being shocked when I found out Gerald Ford was actually an All-American football  player.  You have to see Chevy Chase portray him as a retard.  You just thought he had muscular dystrophy falling down all the time.  And those are young kids.  They do vote.  Yeah, yeah.  And I brought that up later on with Shep. 
[01:04:30]  He brought up the Daily Show.  I go, kids don't get their news from the Daily Show.  Of course they do.  Where did this go after this clip ended?  Huh?  Did they just change the subject?  Because I'm surprised that we don't have more of you.  It ended with Nick hitting the sidewalk and hearing, and stay out.  No, but then the judge goes to me like, oh, he said, Shep actually said, he goes, weren't  you the one that was just sitting here the last hour saying that the stock market went down  the day after Obama got elected by a thousand? 
[01:05:00]  And I didn't say it.  It was somebody else.  I go, I don't even know enough about the economy to make that.  And he did apologize for that.  You know, I go, I didn't say that.  He just wants to pin everything on you.  But no, he apologized right there for that.  But it was you saying, Dewey beat Truman.  It really gets, and you know, and I, I yelled back.  It was weird.  And everybody gets all, it's people are such, oh God, a couple of guys are yelling at each  other.  One of the guys that I was on the panel with, like I'm downstairs.  He goes, are you all right?  I go, am I all right?  All right. 
[01:05:30]  I'm going to sleep like a baby tonight.  This is easy for Nick.  It's not my chick.  I'm Italian.  We did this at the dinner table every night.  Exactly.  This is easy stuff for Nick DiPaolo.  Let's go to Coop in New York.  Coop, how are you, buddy?  Hey, good morning, gentlemen.  Good morning.  Hey, what's up?  Toast, I love your book.  Listen, I wanted to ask something.  You guys are sitting there talking how blacks are walking around arrogant and all this other  stuff.  Yeah.  And how white people, no, excuse me.  Nick was just saying that white people have been pretty much emasculated on the media 
[01:06:00]  for the last 20 years.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  And you guys sound like you're upset about that.  But who are you upset at?  Because we don't control the media.  Blacks don't control the media.  You can't be screaming and yelling about it.  No, no.  We're not blaming that on you, Coop.  No, I never said that.  No.  It's white liberals.  It's the same liberal white people that have this conception that black people can't take  care of themselves, so they have to come to your rescue is what it is. 
[01:06:30]  It's that mindset that has made these commercials always the smart black guy and the goofy, incompetent  white guy that he has to help figure out his taxes or his credit.  Look at any of these, look at these goddamn creditreport.com commercials.  These mother effing credit report commercials.  It's always the white band, you know, this young white guy and he's in his band now with  a bunch of white guys and he's talking about how his credit stinks and he wished it would 
[01:07:00]  have been better so he could do this.  And one of these commercials has him at like a hip hop party.  Yeah, I'm familiar with that commercial.  And like, it's just, it's that whole thing that puts this mindset in that, you know,  dopey white goofy guy and a responsible black guy that's got to set him straight.  Oh, there's a million examples.  Yeah, there's plenty.  Okay.  Also, I wanted to just say something about the black people that's walking around arrogant  and you guys is how do you feel like.  I'm going to say, I think what it is, is that like 60, 50, 60 years ago, white people walked 
[01:07:30]  around with the same attitude, so to speak, that, oh, we got people that represent us so  they could go around and lynch and behave and do what they was doing.  Yeah, well, I wasn't around back then.  Yeah, don't blame us.  I wasn't around.  I wasn't around.  You're absolutely right.  But what I'm saying is this.  Blacks today pretty much took that same attitude.  We pretty much adopted the same attitude and behaviors and manuscripts as you, and the  problem with that is we're not you. 
[01:08:00]  Can I tell you?  And the reason this country, the reason things are the way they are in this country is because  y'all want us to assimilate to you.  At the same time, this is white people.  No, no, not to me, not to white people.  Hey, keep your culture, be proud of it, whatever you want to do.  But I'm talking about, look, look, look, I'm talking about assimilating to society, to  this country, which means you.  And what I want to explain to you is that that would never happen.  It's because we are two different animals.  All right.  It would never happen.  You know something?  We would never get along the way so-called white people dream about and so-called black 
[01:08:30]  people dream about.  You know something?  I agree with it.  You've got kind of a separatist attitude, which I agree with.  We are very different types of people.  But Anthony, he's allowed to have that separatist attitude.  You do like you're a racist.  Yeah, I'm a racist and a white supremacist.  I agree with you.  I mean, there's a lot of nonsense you say that gets me upset.  But I agree with you in that, that we can't, honestly, we are two different people.  And this whole thing wasn't built on equality.  You know what I'm saying?  You're right.  I'm not blaming white people.  I'm not saying you're talking about the devil white men. 
[01:09:00]  What I'm just saying is that it was built with white people in a position of power and  everybody underneath them.  You guys are right.  But let me bring up this point.  You brought up like 60 years ago, and it was very racist and very hard for black people.  And we're still living with the legacy of that.  I said I wasn't around for that.  What I have been around for, though, is to witness a disproportionate amount of crime and  single parenthood abandonment and basic shenanigans on the part of black people that had... 
[01:09:30]  Wait, hold on, hold on.  Let me finish.  Let me finish.  That has affected the way I think in a negative way.  And I'm sorry, as the upbringing that maybe your parents, grandparents had that gave you  a negative outlook of how white people treated black people, I'm having the same negative  attitudes with the way I see black people treating white people and committing crimes  at a disproportionate number.  50% of male blacks are somehow been either incarcerated or through the court systems. 
[01:10:00]  And this has affected me in a negative way.  So I can then blame society for having a negative impact on my outlook and of the future,  of how we're going to get along with each other.  Is that a bad thing, or isn't that the same thing?  No, that's the opinion you've made up for yourself after years and years of life experience. 
[01:10:30]  But let me ask you something.  And you said, so you told Patrice that you have a scholarship, you have a degree in black  people, whatever, whatever.  Okay, but let me ask you, when, do you understand the history of black people in this country  and not just with slavery?  Yeah, I understand everything.  Oh, of course.  Let me ask you something.  Take it easy, will you cope?  Let me say something.  I'm not, I'm just going to say something.  Go ahead, you're up.  First of all, when, I don't want to go there, but I'm just going to go there for a second. 
[01:11:00]  When those Africans were enslaved, they were completely erased of all their humanity.  And those slave masters made them into what they wanted them to be.  They made, they came up with the whole, oh, black is ugly thing, and y'all are this, and  y'all are this, y'all are going to take our religion, and this, and that, and a third.  What happened was, they created shells of human beings, and put what they wanted into  these people.  And when they were done with them, they said, oh, now you're free.  And guess what happened?  Because they created this thing of a human being, we didn't know what to do, so the simple, 
[01:11:30]  the only thing we could do is mimic the best we can, what white people do.  And what happened was, white people showed, improved, the white people were showing, as  hard as y'all people, y'all little black niggas work, to act like y'all, you will never  be us.  So, everything negative in the black community is based on white behavior, all the bad things.  Yeah, right.  Okay, how about, yeah, we also civilized you.  I'm not, I'm not completely knocking you, but if you want to get to the root cause of 
[01:12:00]  it, that's what it is.  I actually hear what he's saying as far as, there wasn't any, like, post-slavery education  where it was like, okay, let's free the slaves and then work to, work them into society.  It was just kind of, hey, you're free, go about your ways.  And then for years, for, you know, a century, you had people going, we don't know what to  do.  You know, I understand what you're saying as far as that's concerned, but you're downplaying 
[01:12:30]  the adaptability and intelligence of black people to be able to...  I understand.  No, you don't hear what I said.  What I said was, these people, they pretty much mimic what white people are doing.  They figure they build schools, they build churches, we'll be white because our God is  quote, white.  You know what I'm saying?  Now, what happened was, white people at that time were showing and proving, you are little  black niggas.  And we're going to hang you and kill you no matter what guy you believe in.  Despite the fact that it's our God you believe in and you're looking to be like us, you're not 
[01:13:00]  us and we will never accept you as us.  This is back then.  Yeah.  And this is the mentality we have today.  It's a self-hating thing that black people has pretty much perpetuated itself to this  day.  Well, what he's saying is whitey's thought.  I could, you know something though?  I can actually kind of understand what he's saying.  In a way.  I do.  But, you know.  But I'm also saying that there is an intellect there.  There's something there that you need to understand that there's adaptability. 
[01:13:30]  People come here from other countries all the time.  From countries that are impoverished.  From countries that are uneducated.  And they come here, assimilate to the society, and use it to the best of their abilities  to make the best of themselves.  But they came assimilated to the society, what, the last hundred years?  One thing you're doing though is you're kind of taking away the human nature factor in  it.  Right, right.  Like there is a human nature thing where, look, no one can already fog your 40 acres and  a mule.  Everybody knows that that's the reality of what happened.  But, you know, like there's never been a black president.  And so when a black president wins, attitudes are going to be different. 
[01:14:00]  That's just, it's human nature.  That would happen anywhere.  You're right.  All right.  Right on.  All right, Coop.  Thank you.  Thanks a lot, Coop.  We've got to take a break.  We really have to take a break.  This one really wants to talk to Anthony.  Marianne, can you hold through the break?  Yes.  All right, hold on.  She is.  She is.  She's a little wound up.  She is wound up.  We've got Nick DiPaolo in studio, nickdip.com.  Jimmy's going to Providence tonight for a book signing.  Six o'clock, Borders, Providence Place, and Providence, Rhode Island. 
[01:14:30]  And then Wilbur Theater in Boston this weekend.  Very cool.  Opie and Anthony, stay there.  Anyone else noticing the Opie and Anthony show just flies by lately?  It certainly does.  Wow.  Look at the time.  We haven't even done anything yet, and we're almost done.  We're doing plenty, let me tell you, my friend.  We've got an hour left.  Opie and Anthony, nickdip.com, nickdip.com, Nick DiPaolo in studio.  And Marianne, she's just livid.  What's wrong with Marianne?  Let's talk to Marianne from New Jersey.  What's up, Marianne?  Marianne. 
[01:15:00]  I'm from Sayville, Long Island.  All right.  Sayville.  Right on.  Whatever.  Okay, that's not my point.  Whatever.  Welcome aboard.  I'm going to make three quick points.  Okay.  You make your points and stay on the line, okay?  So we can talk.  All right.  Let me do something.  Go ahead.  Okay, go ahead, Marianne.  All right, Marianne.  What do you got for the program?  Yeah.  Let her talk.  Do it under your time.  We're just setting up, Marianne.  Don't interrupt her.  Because I really want to hear what you are saying.  All right.  Go.  Okay.  Marianne, go ahead.  Son of a bitch.  Go ahead.  Anthony.  Yes.  One week, you have sounded like a sore loser white supremacist. 
[01:15:30]  Point number one.  Uh-huh.  Point number two.  All right.  Open up Newsday today and see what's on the front cover.  Seven white kids beating up or killing.  Killing a man just one week.  Yep.  Saw that.  Number three.  Two towns being hit with Ku Klux Klan literature.  Yeah.  Okay.  So don't tell me that the prisons are full of black people.  I'm a white woman.  I didn't say full.  I didn't say full.  You did.  Get my points right.  I said there's a disproportionate number, and I said 50% of black males end up going 
[01:16:00]  through some portion of the penal system.  That is a fact.  That isn't me making crap up.  That is a fact.  And about me sounding like a white supremacist over the past week or so since Obama was elected,  I'm seeing things that are happening outside.  I'm experiencing things myself.  This isn't my imagination.  I am being bullied.  That is just what's happening.  And as far as the front cover Newsday, that's a horrible story where white kids killed a 
[01:16:30]  Hispanic guy just on race alone.  How many of those do you see on a daily or weekly basis in the papers?  That's why they make front page news.  Because they rarely happen.  What does happen is groups of black thugs will beat the crap out of white people and rob  them.  That's the crap that makes page 17.  Anthony.  What?  Why don't you use the power of the media that you have to try to bring to the media? 
[01:17:00]  I am.  I am.  Thank God I'm here.  Thank Jesus effing Christ.  I am here to spread my word.  You really got to listen to Marianne.  She's making a very good point, Anthony.  You got a lot of power.  What should I be doing, Marianne?  Marianne, please tell me.  Use your power for good like Marianne's trying to do.  Let Marianne tell me what I should be doing.  Okay, the country is moving in a new direction right now.  You need to jump on board.  Jump on the train and be with everybody else.  Jump on the train.  That's right. 
[01:17:30]  The boxcar to Auschwitz.  Go blow me.  All right.  I just dumped out.  I'm sorry.  You see what you're doing?  What?  You sound ridiculous.  No, I don't.  You sound ridiculous.  You sound ridiculous.  You sound ridiculous.  A new direction.  Is the new direction five thugs on a sidewalk pulling out their racial crap on me this morning?  Just this morning.  A couple of hours ago.  Because of what you're saying on the media.  What?  They don't know who the hell I am, dummy.  They do. 
[01:18:00]  I know they don't.  They do, right, Marianne?  Listen, you're going to attack me like that.  Hey, hey, you know something?  Yep.  Leave your door unlocked and your window open at night.  And I hope you become a statistic of a home break-in.  And you'll see what happens.  You'll see what happens when a phone cords around your goddamn neck.  You friggin' blind bitch.  You're a blind bitch.  Wow.  You don't want to see things.  Open your eyes.  Goddamn C word.  You're a C word.  And it ends with a T, that whole thing. 
[01:18:30]  She's not a cat.  She's a crout.  That's a K.  I know.  Let me go up to Boston, Anthony, and say hi to Assad.  I know.  I know Boston's going to agree with me.  Assad's a black guy.  Come on, Assad.  What do you got?  What do you got, Assad?  Yeah, I totally agree with Anthony.  I'm tired of black people blowing everything on slavery.  That was like 400 years ago.  You got a baby inside.  My mom grew up in a rough time.  She went to school in Southie like 30 years ago, which is horrible.  And she never told me, oh, hate white people, hate white people.  She told me, hey, that's what happened. 
[01:19:00]  I said, get over it.  You know what I mean?  You can't use everything like that.  And I'm sick of black people telling their kids, oh, no, the white man's trying to hold you down.  That's horrible.  That's not true.  I mean, most people, they held the hell back.  Close up.  Al Roker, look how well he did.  Yeah, see?  All right.  Here's a nice stat for you.  Thank you, Assad.  Three times as many young black men are in prison as are in college dorms right now as we speak.  Don't you think that's a little odd?  And don't tell me it's our racist system. 
[01:19:30]  Any system will take a crime and then convict you for it.  Hey, Fast Freddy writes, I don't think you need to open today's Newsday to see the cover.  She's a dummy.  Oh, open.  I missed that.  Let's go to Dirty Harry in New York.  Dirty Harry, what do you got?  Hey, you guys are cracking me up because, listen, my parents are from Haiti.  I'm black.  I'm from Haiti.  I'm Haiti, everybody. 
[01:20:00]  No, go ahead, my friend.  I'm sorry.  Listen, I mean, when I had my ex-girlfriend was Italian.  And her dad did not know who I was.  Because, obviously, I guess I don't sound too black on the phone.  Yeah.  The day he met me, I realized that I'm never stepping in his house again because otherwise  I'd get some concrete shoes on.  Well, is he Frank Vinson from Jungle Fever?  Yeah.  Yeah, pretty much.  I mean, listen, I'm not the average black guy.  I played hockey.  I snowboard. 
[01:20:30]  I just quit a metal band.  You know, I...  You sure you're black?  Yeah, exactly.  That's amazing, of course.  I'm not going to say the same damn thing, ladies.  But, you know what?  I still see it.  I still see it happening.  I see both sides.  I understand you guys because I know the night that Obama came in, let me tell you, the  city was alight.  People leaning on their horns.  Every bus driver was going crazy.  I thought they were going to run over nearby white people.  Yeah, there was a celebration.  Yeah, there were white people, too.  There were white people celebrating.  Of course.  I don't like that you said you guys.  I are all about the black man these days. 
[01:21:00]  Well, I wanted Obama.  I like him.  We're feeling your pain and we're happy Obama's in there.  Right, Jimmy?  You know something?  Let me be completely honest with you.  I'll be completely honest with you.  All right.  I've gotten well over the fact that Obama is elected.  My guy McCain, he didn't make it in.  He wasn't really...  Not much of a guy, though.  I really didn't like what he saw.  I'm not freaking out like the greatest candidate ever got beat.  Right.  And I do want to see what Obama can bring to the table as far as being president for  four years. 
[01:21:30]  I don't like the fact that he's got a lot of Democrats to back him up in Congress.  But whatever.  Let's see what happens.  I'm open-minded.  I'm willing to say, hey, let's see what happens.  I think he does seem sincere.  I don't like a lot of his positions.  A lot of his platforms stinks, if you ask me.  That fairness doctrine is frightening.  I don't like that.  I don't like his taxing.  I don't like his Second Amendment stance.  It's horrible.  It's an abomination of the Constitution.  But look.  Let me see what he could do.  But it's this other thing, this attitude that is going on in the country. 
[01:22:00]  This has polarized the country, I think, more than brought it together.  There's this phony bringing together thing that's going on.  It's a phoniness that, again, the media is perpetrating that makes it look like everyone's  getting along, that everything's a Sonny D commercial, where the whole, oh, look, there's a little  Asian kid, a little black kid, the little white kid.  They're all in the house getting Sonny D.  Well, everyone loves Sonny D.  Yeah, what's wrong with Sonny D?  Do they?  Yes.  I'm excited to see the miracles, because we haven't seen miracles since Jesus. 
[01:22:30]  Yeah.  I'm just happy that we can finally see miracles like they did back when Jesus was doing the  miracles.  Everything's going to be good.  Oh, it's going to get ugly.  He's the first one.  He's the first.  Hold on.  Hold on, sir.  He's the first black guy.  That's all it is.  It's like, you've got to look at it in a historical sense.  No, but he's biracial.  He may be, but he's black.  Statistically.  No, he's not black.  He's biracial.  He was black.  Listen.  Hold on.  Back in the day.  You know what?  Yeah, I know.  Dirty Harry, I've got to hang up on you.  Jimmy's trying to make a lie.  No, I'm just saying it's like if you look at it 100 years, let's say there's 25 more 
[01:23:00]  elections, 25 elections.  Let's just say four more presidents are black, 21 are white in the next 100 years.  Each black president won't matter as much.  It doesn't matter.  Just the first time you deal with anything, you have to put up with some crap.  That's all it is.  Why put up with crap and why not put up with some pride?  Again, it's human nature.  Have pride in the fact that, wow, you know something?  We do live in a country where that if you do use this system, the way it's put in place,  Maybe they all come out in the end of time, no? 
[01:23:30]  That it, you know, it's not me being the optimist over here, but maybe it will.  I didn't know who the hell that was talking behind me.  I think you're, I think people are doing that.  It might have, there might be a segment of the population that's like, hey, you know  what, Whitey ain't that bad.  I'm sure there is a segment of the population, but what I saw this morning was just another  little jab in my side.  With that, we got, where's your trees when you need them?  Is that Malik?  Oh, no, this is Danny.  Oh, this Danny guy.  I remember you, Danny.  Hey, how you doing?  Hey, man.  How you doing, little Jim?  Hey, how are you?  Thank you, man.  Thank you. 
[01:24:00]  This guy has a way of making a point, this Danny.  I remember you.  Go ahead, Danny.  Hey, Anthony.  Yo, what's up, man?  Let me tell you something, man.  You know what the problem is.  You notice that it's not Opie and little Jimmy screaming, it's the Italian guys.  And the reason is because, you know, back in the days, y'all were the tough guys after,  you know, Streetcar called Desire and all that.  Y'all became the tough guys, the romantic figures, the boxers.  And then Black Seat, the media, and y'all lost the franchise.  Yeah.  I love that.  That's it.  I love that guy.  You got a snail, man.  The Italians, we lost our spot on the pyramid. 
[01:24:30]  Still knocked out Joe Louis.  Here's the deal.  You know how, you know, what happened is y'all created a, well, not y'all, y'all forefathers.  They created a permanent underclass, and they didn't set up a therapy situation or a mainstreaming  into jobs.  They did not have any jobs.  So, you know, you have to take responsibility for some of the stuff that you say are negative.  Not this far into it.  We only got one black guy who ain't even in yet. 
[01:25:00]  Y'all had 43 guys in there.  And let me ask you a question.  And look at what a disaster the United States ended up being the only superpower left.  World power.  Oh, no.  We're 43 guys in there.  Why is there an appellation, man?  Why is there whites in trailer parks and poor whites, man?  There are.  That's just the way this is.  But I'm saying, why?  I'm saying now that Obama's in, that every black should now become, you know, president.  I didn't say that.  I never said that.  They just want to be normal people and live normal, man.  So then be normal people and live normal. 
[01:25:30]  It's not my responsibility to make someone.  Pick up a book by Lewis Potts.  It's called Liberators on Two Fronts, The Second World War.  And hear about two people, blacks and Jews, who went through some stuff, man, by the hands  of some misguided people.  And when you finish that book, man, you're going to change your tune.  Believe me.  Why don't you pick up a book called Slouching Towards Gomorrah by Judge Robert Bork, and  then you can find out how we're getting the message.  You know, let's do each other's. 
[01:26:00]  But what I'm saying is...  Why don't you watch Bridge on the River Kwai?  You know something, man...  Why don't you pick up I Hate Your Guts by Jim Norton?  Yes.  Get it signed.  You can set off something, man, that you don't really mean to in a humorous way, but there  are some nutcases that really are feeling, you know, pressed upon.  They don't understand people being pressed upon for like 400 years here.  You don't think I could go to websites, black separatists, black supremacist websites?  The Black Panthers are able to walk... 
[01:26:30]  That's what I'm saying, brother.  Wait, wait, wait.  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  It's on both sides.  The Black Panthers...  No, it's not on both sides.  It's one-sided.  The Black Panthers...  No, it's not.  Yes, they are.  The Black Panthers are a lot...  Can I talk?  God damn it.  Well, I don't know.  Can you?  Let me talk...  Yeah.  Yes, I can.  Love this, Danny.  Just quiet for a second.  Don't get your panties in a bunch, man.  Jesus Christ.  My panties aren't in a bunch.  Look, you proved you're a funny guy.  And here's how you...  You keep talking, and don't let me speak.  You don't let me speak.  No, I'm not going to let you. 
[01:27:00]  La, la, la.  Anthony.  I'm not letting you speak.  Anthony.  I'm not going to let you speak.  No, I'm playing sound effects and not letting anyone hear you talk, because you won't let  me talk.  You won't let me say a word.  That's how you fight.  You just go on in there, and don't let me talk.  That's it.  Screw you.  You're not saying another word on my show.  Go screw yourself.  Thank God the Blazing Saddles template wasn't in.  All right, hold on.  Give Danny a chance. 
[01:27:30]  We've talked a lot, Anthony, today.  No, I want to talk.  You've done a lot of talking today.  Nah, screw him.  Danny, what's your last point?  Let me hear what you got to say.  Is this Danny Glover?  Hopefully it's the last point before I hear you taking your life.  Watch.  Let me hear what you got to say.  You annoy me.  Yeah, he wants to hear what you have to say.  Anthony, let me hear your point.  Yeah, go ahead.  I forgot.  Come on, Anthony.  Come on.  I want to hear your point.  Don't play that.  Two words.  Joke.  All right, well, let me just say this.  You ain't talking.  You know who would hate for slavery to come back more than black people?  White people.  Because with all of the money white women got today and all of the freedom and power, they 
[01:28:00]  would buy them some basketball and football teams, and that would be the last naked white  woman that white men would ever see.  Yeah, I love that fantasy they got going about white women.  I know white women that would even talk to you, man.  That's why they're all fat-ass, bleach-blonde pigs.  Just give me a break, would you?  Just stop it.  You're a funny dude.  Stop it.  Hey, Danny, how'd Roy Jones...  All he had to do was get out of the car.  All he had to do was get out of the car and go talk to those guys.  All right. 
[01:28:30]  Oh, yeah, get out of my car and talk to them, yeah, and get a Reginald Denny hat.  Get out of here.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  You're talking out your ass.  You're talking out your ass.  Shut up.  You really set me straight, Danny.  Maybe we should just do some talking.  Yeah.  Maybe we should get to know each other finally.  Shut up.  Yeah, let me step out of the vehicle and have a civilized conversation with them.  Right.  That would have happened.  At 5.15 in the morning?  I feel sorry for the poor white son of a bitch that came upon those guys after I had a discussion with them. 
[01:29:00]  That's who I feel bad for because he's probably a white guy laying down there on Lex.  Lex in 57th.  He's probably laying there bleeding as we speak.  All right, Danny.  I'm a big fan.  Bye, Danny.  Well, we'll see you in the 19th century, Anthony.  We're going on to the 21st.  Danny, how'd Roy Jones Jr. do against Calzaghe?  I don't know.  Yeah, you do know, stupid.  Shut up.  I brought him in the door, man.  All right. 
[01:29:30]  That's it.  Yap, yap, yap.  Don't let anyone talk.  Good strategy.  Reginald Denny was actually.  Here's what happened with Reginald Denny.  He did get out.  And he's like, someone has taken my hat.  And they're like, well, sir, we don't have one.  But we do have this porcelain object that you may want to use as a hat.  Yes.  They were trying to help Reginald.  And as you put the hat on, watch me do a little dance.  Yes.  That was the here's your hat dance.  Let's go to Boston again.  Jason, how are you, buddy?  Get out of the car.  What was I going to do?  Get out of here.  A lot of calls from Boston these days. 
[01:30:00]  What's up?  Take an APC into work.  Go ahead, Jason.  What's happening, guys?  How you doing?  Hey.  You know, it's going to be funny is all these uneducated people are going to be very upset  when they find out that Obama is just as white as you and I.  And that guy that just called in saying, welcome to the 21st century, they can't even  get out of the 18th century.  Sir, let me tell you something about Obama, though.  He's not as white as you and I.  Obama is, I like him, but he's more radical than he let on.  Look, it is what it is.  He was there with Jeremiah Wright, said what he said.  He probably agrees with a lot of what Jeremiah Wright said. 
[01:30:30]  He's much more radical.  I agree.  That said, I still like him.  But I mean, I don't care if he is.  But don't be fooled, sir.  Guy brings up a great point, though.  It's like Danny there was telling me to get out of the 19th century.  What do they bring up every two seconds?  They bring up the 1700s.  Give me a break.  I'm in the now.  I'm in the future.  I have my eyes open. 
[01:31:00]  I'm looking at what's going on.  And you're paying for the past.  Yeah, exactly.  Let's go to Mike in Boston.  Five steps ahead, everybody, pally.  Mikey, what's up?  Hey, guys.  How are you this morning?  Oh, we're loving it.  Great.  We're very laid back.  I'm listening.  I can't stop thinking to myself that Anthony, you're paranoid.  It seems like you're a couple weeks away from locking yourself in the basement of your nice house with your guns on your chest.  And, you know, you feel that you're taking over here.  I love the unraveling of Anthony. 
[01:31:30]  You'll be able to see it.  Sounds like a plan.  The unraveling of Anthony is beautiful.  Look.  Makes for a great radio.  Look, the only reason I...  When you do, like, have a nervous breakdown, can you at least do it with one of your voices?  This will not turn into a nervous breakdown.  This is somebody...  You were just bragging to Nick about how many guns you have.  I said, wow, it sounds like a sock drawer, but it's filled with guns instead of socks.  That's how many guns you got.  Look, look.  I'll be real for a second here.  The only reason I own guns and I purchase guns is because with the Democrats in office, they're not going to allow me to purchase the guns I want. 
[01:32:00]  They dub them assault weapons and take them off the market.  So I have to buy them now so I can own them in the future.  Believe me.  Within four years of that election, they're going to reenact the assault weapons ban and you're not going to be able to get an AR-15 anymore.  You're not going to be...  You're going to be able to get a bolt-action hunting rifle.  Maybe for ammunition, you're going to pay 500% tax on ammunition. 
[01:32:30]  So I'm buying up stuff I'm not going to be able to get.  You can do a lot with a bolt-action rifle.  Look at our old friend Lee Harvey.  Lee Harvey.  Outstanding.  It's turning into the opium Captain Queen show.  Sure.  Strawberries.  How many portions did you have?  Exactly.  They were all looking at me.  They were yelling Obama.  I knew that he hadn't won the election.  Call me old Yellowstain.  Old Yellowstain.  I knew.  Stupid Fred McMurray.  Yeah.  I got the Yellowstain blues.  They made a song about him. 
[01:33:00]  I love the excitement Anthony has lately.  Oh, look at Reginald.  Oh, thanks, Danny, for pulling that up.  Look at them helping him out.  Reginald.  Oh, they were helping him.  He's like, my hat.  Where's my hat?  Get this guy a hat.  Find a hat for him.  Look at him all lazy.  He's laying, but you know what?  He's so upset that he doesn't have a hat.  He's laying down.  He's trying to reach for his hat.  And then look at this gentleman that comes over and gives him a hat.  I think he's already been given.  Oh, is he a mess?  Wow.  Unbelievable.  Bastard.  All right, we got to take a break.  Listen, blacks were barely considered human 60 years ago. 
[01:33:30]  That's Malik.  Wants to defend Anthony.  He is my brother in arms.  Aren't the blacks the ones that sold their own people to us?  This guy's in a mixed relationship.  I endure racism all the time.  Parole officer, 100% of my parolees are black.  Watch 48 Hours, that show where they take the first 48.  Why is it that it's 99% black people committing these crimes?  I have an answer for that.  Yeah.  Do you?  Yeah, Jimmy will tell you.  Would you please give him a... 
[01:34:00]  He'll tell you after the break.  I'm not being negative here.  I'm not being a racist.  I want to know why.  Is it the media?  Jimmy's got an answer for you after the break.  And also, speaking of racism, the biggest racist we know will join the show next.  Why are we even having him on today?  Well, Brian Regan.  He has a lot to say about this black and white thing.  He is probably the biggest racist we know.  Wasn't he head of the Klan once?  I do believe he was.  Brian Regan next.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony. 
[01:34:30]  Starring Jim Norton.  On the bestseller list with I Hate Your Guts.  Yes.  Congrats.  Thank you, man.  We're very happy for Jimmy.  I'll be signing tonight at Rhode Island, 6 o'clock reporters on Providence Place and Providence.  I read your Oscar chapter last night.  I loved it.  Thank you, man.  I read your chapter on the, quote, dude that got pregnant.  Oh, did you give him a beating in your book?  I loved it.  I deserved it.  Because the media, like, make him believe it was an actual man that was pregnant.  Pregnant man. 
[01:35:00]  And Jimmy made some fine points in his book.  I Hate Your Guts about that whole thing.  It was a lesbian.  Yeah.  Just pretty much.  Simple as that.  Nick DiPaolo from NickDip.com.  And I'm pregnant also.  Yeah.  Just found out.  And the racist Brian Regan in the studio.  So we're all set for another fine segment.  It's good to hate, man.  Hate all you can.  We got Mike in New York.  He's a black guy.  Because now when you call the show, you either have to say you're a black guy or a white guy.  Yo. 
[01:35:30]  And he's a motivational speaker for black youth.  And he agrees with a lot of Anthony's points.  Oh, you're failing.  Interesting.  Mike, how are you, buddy?  What's going on, man?  First of all, I'm from Buffalo.  And I want to apologize for the time I woke you up in your apartment.  And that's why I chose Motivation of Speaking to get my life together.  So, you know.  Nice.  You helped me.  But listen.  First of all, Jimmy, congratulations on the book, man.  Thank you, man.  Thank you very much.  You're a very funny dude.  Thanks, Mike.  And Anthony, you're hilarious, too. 
[01:36:00]  But I'm about to get you behind right now.  All right.  What happens is a lot of times, most of the stuff that goes on, man, I agree with 100%.  I mean, it's self-inflicted.  You know, the foolishness that, you know, these kids, you know, and it's mostly the youth.  You know what I mean?  Like, to catch my age, I'm 41 years old.  Yeah, yeah.  We kind of move beyond that kind of stuff.  You know, we realize that, you know, getting a house and a job and a car and a family, that's  what you do.  That's how you do things.  But what I explain to the youth is, they've got somebody for you. 
[01:36:30]  That's just called the law.  You understand?  The law will take care of them because they play right into the law's hands.  But, like, when I speak to the younger, you know, like the freshmen in college, the ones  who are actually trying to do something, I tell them the most dangerous black person  is the one who sits back and learns and takes from the power that be, you know, the white  steps.  You sit back and learn from them.  I understand that.  But why does it have to be that?  Like, why does it have to be the most dangerous is the one that learns? 
[01:37:00]  Like, why do you want to be, why does the youth want to be dangerous and have to have this  street cred and respect?  No, because it sounds like the most dangerous is the educated going to school.  Like, why motivate like that?  No, no, I'm not motivated like that.  What I'm expressing is when you're viewed a certain way, like I said, the thugs or what  have you, you know, the image that is portrayed on TV, like I said, the first 40 hours, those 
[01:37:30]  fools always get caught because they're dummies.  Okay.  Now, when you educate yourself, whatever that may be, you know, however that may be, you  are the one who has the advantage.  All you have to do is sit back and watch, you understand, and observe.  Then you get what you want.  You don't have to go out and steal and this and that.  So that's what I mean by dangerous.  I'm not talking about dangerous to the white man or whatever.  I'm just saying that's when you become cunning, you know, that's when you become, you know,  intelligent.  That's what you want to be.  Street credibility is crap. 
[01:38:00]  There's no such thing, man.  Yeah, well, apparently it's pretty important to certain people.  Well, you know, when that's all, you know, that you strive for, you know, small things  do become important to you.  That's nothing, man.  You understand?  The most important thing is, like I said, the image and the legacy that you leave when  you have kids.  You understand?  That's where I'm at.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, you got kids?  Yeah, I got dying little girls, man.  You know, and that's very important to me, me not being with my father.  You have one woman that you're with or with these girls? 
[01:38:30]  I've been married four years now.  See, all that stuff.  See, you mean one woman.  See, there you go.  No, no, I'm just asking.  You know, I don't get it.  There you go.  I just wanted to see, I just wanted to see, just wanted to see, my friend, because there  is, you're not saying that there's a disproportionate number of single mothers out there and kids  being raised by grandparents.  You don't see that?  Anthony, you're surprised when you hear that a black guy is actually married with kids  and doing the right thing.  That's what I just was asking. 
[01:39:00]  Why do I have to catch crap for asking?  There's plenty of black guys out there married with kids doing the right thing.  Give me my eggshells and I'll walk on them.  Tired of it.  But, like I said, that's important to me.  Me, like I said, my situation was, my dad was, you know, a heroin addict.  You know, like I said, that was the era he was from.  You know, he didn't, you know, he didn't contribute.  Mom did.  You know, grandma did.  That type of thing.  So, you can either use that as a crutch and be a scumbag, or you can, like I said, do 
[01:39:30]  better.  See, like I said, my legacy for my daughter would not be the same as my father's was for  me.  Well, good.  See, that's good.  That's right.  That's good.  That's what it's about.  But what you have to understand, there is a number of, you know, there is a number of  black men who do, you know, fit the profile that I just described to you, you know, but  then again, society's job, I don't want to say media, because, you know, that's lame,  but the betrayal often is the negative, because positive never sells. 
[01:40:00]  You know that.  Let me ask you a question, because I haven't experienced the same thing Anthony has, but  I mean, you know, Anthony has certainly seen it.  Oh, you will.  No, no, I mean, but what, all right, you're a black guy.  So what is, you know, you have the inside skinny.  What's the vibe among black people?  Is it more happy that Obama got elected, or is it more all of a sudden an anger is servicing?  All right, listen, okay, let me break it down this way.  You have certain groups with certain emotions, okay? 
[01:40:30]  So like I said, the people my age, the ones that I roll with, we're just happy, you know,  for the symbolism of it.  Right.  Now, we're not fools to think we can just go get free Cadillacs and two white women and  all that.  That's not going to be the federal laws.  Well, not his platform?  Yeah.  So like I said, my group is excited, you know, about the fact that, you know, we actually  saw this.  It's cool. 
[01:41:00]  Now, if he does, you know, change something, if he changes, if he just makes the economy  better, it's great.  Okay, he's done his job.  Like, Anthony, I hear about you, you know, with your taxes, your stories and all that.  Like I said, I listen every day.  Like, you know, I love you.  Thank you.  I understand where you come from.  You know, you pull yourself up by your bootstraps, but if you ain't got no boots, you might be,  you know, you're in trouble.  You know what I mean?  A lot of people out here ain't got no boots, man, for whatever reason.  Well, you know something, when you're inside and you realize that you need boots, you got  to do something to get some boots. 
[01:41:30]  You can't go out without boots and then go, why don't I have boots?  Let me take some boots.  You're going to steal some boots then.  No, but listen, what happened is, like you said, the other group are the people that  you talk about that I hear, you know, Obama's going to, you know, just change things over  and he's not.  You know, let's be realistic.  Even if it was a white man in there, he wasn't going to change it.  There's too many things on the menu to be changed.  You know what I mean?  So if he throws us a bone, you know, or whatever it is, that's cool.  He's done his job.  But he's not going to make it a black world to where, you know, like I said, we run around 
[01:42:00]  slapping white folks and getting off it.  We don't do that.  You do that under white presidents.  Yeah.  Okay, Regan.  Hey.  That was Nick DiPaolo.  That was Nick.  Let me get that straight.  I said one funny thing in an hour.  That was Nick DiPaolo.  Nick DiPaolo.  NickDip.com.  Don't pay it on Regan.  If Regan had, like, black protesters outside of shows screaming that he was a racist.  Hey, wait a minute.  I didn't say anything.  I didn't say that.  What did I say? 
[01:42:30]  Well, like I said, man, I've always been an open mind.  You know, I've got white friends, and I'm not saying that to be cliche, but my white  friends are the white friends who, my white friends were white trash.  Put it that way.  Yeah.  You know, because those are the white guys that I knew, you know, kind of like you, Anthony,  growing up.  Yeah, it's true.  I absolutely put myself in the white trash section.  Stuff like that.  I was Long Island white trash growing up.  Absolutely.  I can tell that.  You know what I mean?  I love you for that.  Anthony's rich like Steve Martin was in The Jerk. 
[01:43:00]  Yeah, that's sweet.  I like that.  But listen, I'm listening to you guys talk.  Jimmy, I can tell Jimmy has dealt with black people, and he knows black people.  So, you know, he actually, I don't want to say steady, but he actually kind of picked  up a lot of things about hearing how he talks.  Anthony, you know, you went through the give me 50 cents stage, give me some money, I'm  going to kick your ass stage.  You know what I mean?  And Anthony, and Opie, Opie, you know.  Opie's been sheltered from black people in Centerport. 
[01:43:30]  Opie, man.  You know, he sees black people and thinks, you know, Jesus Christ.  What, you know.  No.  Opie worked with him as caddies at the Crescent Club every so often.  No, my sport growing up was basketball, so, you know, a lot of interaction.  I mean, my famous, Mike, my famous story, you know, I was hanging out with black people  so much, I felt like I could talk like them a little bit.  Not, not wigger crap, but, you know, on the basketball court, they're throwing the  N-word around, and one of my good friends, he, you know, I've told the story a million 
[01:44:00]  times, but he sinks a three-pointer, and I turn around and I go, nice shot, N.  And next thing you know, I'm waking up because he knocked me out.  Knocked me out, and I learned a valuable lesson.  Oh, okay, I guess I can't say that word in front of other black people, even if I meant  it in a nice way.  Maybe it wasn't a good shot.  Maybe it was not a good shot.  Right, yeah.  You're looking at it different.  He said it to the wrong guy.  It had nothing to do with that.  It was an air ball.  He missed it completely.  Yeah.  I grew up listening to Off the Wall because, you know, my fellow basketball players were 
[01:44:30]  enjoying the early Michael Jackson stuff.  I tried to assimilate.  Okay.  Do you mean Michael Jordan?  No, I said Michael Jackson, Off the Wall.  Oh, Off the Wall.  Okay, good.  I'm a little slow this morning.  Last time I was a male.  Yeah, no.  Yeah, exactly.  But like I said, man, I'm a great fan, man.  Like I said, I listen all the time.  Thanks, man.  And whenever I'm in New York, you better let me in the studio.  Oh, hell yeah, we will.  Thanks, Mike.  I appreciate it.  Later.  Very good phone call from Mike in Buffalo.  So, hey, Brian, what are you up to? 
[01:45:00]  You're playing tonight in where?  Kingston, New York?  Kingston, New York.  Ooh.  Ulster Performing Arts Center.  And then Boston on Friday, Atlantic City Saturday.  Wow.  Good routing.  Stamford, Connecticut.  Yeah, no kidding.  And then Fairbanks on Sunday morning.  And then Miami.  Fairbanks, Alaska, then Miami.  You should have started at AC and worked your way up or started at Boston and worked your  way down.  Yeah, he has to go to Boston, then Atlantic City, and then back up to Connecticut, according  to your schedule here. 
[01:45:30]  It's all on Brian Regan.  I just picture this like Learjet with Regan on the tail.  Yeah, I wish.  And he just gets on there.  All right, pilot.  Yeah.  Hey, we're going to change gears for a second.  We lost another DJ.  What?  This one, we can't really help the guy out on this one.  We try to help out the guys that are getting fired for doing some pretty basic, tame stuff.  He said, dang it.  Well, now you're in trouble.  It's a liberal talk show host, and he had some things to say about Joe the Plumber. 
[01:46:00]  But the problem was, it was a hot mic, and they were doing some kind of news report,  and you could hear him in the background just cursing and saying crazy stuff about Joe  the Plumber.  He doesn't use enough flux when he solders pipe.  Flux.  I remember that.  Flux.  You got to use more flux.  Shut up with your flux.  Can't they invent solder?  They still have that?  I don't need flux.  I don't know.  Every time I was in the work truck, there was that goop with the brush stuck in it. 
[01:46:30]  Yeah, it's like air wax.  You got to put flux on it.  It makes the solder flow.  How funny would it be if there was a Flux University?  Oh, the T-shirts.  All right, let's play this clip from the radio guy that got fired.  Listen to this.  With only a few days to go before the election, John McCain tells ABC News Radio there's still  a lot of work to do.  We're going to campaign hard.  We're going to campaign on the differences between myself and Senator Obama. 
[01:47:00]  Joe the Plumber made it very clear to the people of this country that he wants to, quote,  spread the wealth around.  I want Joe the Plumber dead.  Don't want that.  I actually agree with him.  Yes.  This guy is so fired.  With the bleeps, it messes it up a little bit.  He said, F goddamn Joe the goddamn plumber.  F-ing F-er.  I want mother F-ing Joe the Plumber dead.  All right, Mike.  Because you disagree with him?  Yeah. 
[01:47:30]  Typical liberal douche.  I think he got fired because of the F-ing.  Drop an F-bomb.  Of course.  Instead of, you know, talking about Joe the Plumber.  See ya.  Good riddance, you intolerant douche.  Yeah.  That's the same station that Bernie Ward was on, who was a real left liberal.  Oh, Bernie Ward was a naughty, naughty boy.  Bernie Ward was very naughty.  He had a very naughty hard drive.  Yeah.  Oh, oh, okay.  Yeah, Bernie Ward apparently liked to send naughty photos of people who were allegedly 
[01:48:00]  not 18.  Oopsie.  Actually, they weren't.  They were kids.  And that's a station whose talk format is suffering.  Yeah.  Wow.  The guy that we just played, he also played Ding Dong and the Witch is Dead when Reagan  died.  Yep.  Really?  Wow, he's edgy, huh?  He's brave.  And also said Tony Snow got cancer because he lied to the American people.  Oh, is that right?  I don't care.  That clip, the guy was talking, I mean, he knew the guy was on the air.  That's why I don't understand that.  The guy talking was the host, and he didn't realize that he hadn't turned his mic off, 
[01:48:30]  so he's playing a news clip cursing in the background with his own live mic on.  We do that all the time here.  When we're playing some audio, we keep our mics on.  Another genius liberal.  A lot of these guys turn the mic off until the clip's over, and I don't think he meant  to.  I hope he finds a lump on his left nut and spreads to us.  I don't think he meant to be throwing the F-bombs out there like that.  Even though he is a liberal tool, I like him because he said something awful about a  dead guy, he attacked cancer, and then he wants Joe the Plumber dead.  The guy's just kind of a dick, which I kind of, I like that. 
[01:49:00]  He's a dick.  Triple whammy, man.  Yeah.  He's kind of a cowardly dick.  Say something.  Yeah, I know.  Make a joke about Martin Luther King Jr.  They don't.  Yeah, go ahead.  Try that.  Yeah.  Do you agree with everything that he did so that there's nothing you can say bad about  him?  Exactly.  So pick one thing that you don't agree with and throw that out there.  They'd never-  Reverend Abernathy!  They picked the easy targets.  A dead Ronald Reagan.  Wow!  That one's going to come back to haunt you. 
[01:49:30]  Yeah, exactly.  Literally.  Boo.  Yes.  Boo.  Fake shark stuff.  Say something about somebody who can pop you in the mouth.  Yeah.  Do that.  That would be edgy.  Yeah.  They are a bunch of just-  Yeah, they're fake cowards.  Babies.  That's why their radio, any of the liberal radio stations go on the toilet after five minutes.  Phony bravado that just, yeah, pick the easy targets.  Oh, I don't know about that.  That guy's pretty dangerous.  Yeah, he sounds it.  I don't know.  He's a dick.  What's he going to do?  Reagan.  There's ten years he didn't know where he was. 
[01:50:00]  He finally dies.  Thank God for Reagan.  He was probably like, you know, thanking God that death finally came knocking.  And that's the guy he chooses to play Ding Dong, The Witch is Dead.  First of all, how relevant is that?  In that city?  Very.  What city was that, Jimmy?  San Francisco.  Yeah.  They love that one.  Yeah.  Of course.  There you go.  Yes.  Witch is dead, but the queen's okay.  Teehee.  Give me those ribs, you.  All right.  I think we should take a break to catch up. 
[01:50:30]  Oh, for Christ's sake.  We're just getting going.  I know we are, but what are you going to do?  What are you going to do?  Take a break.  Something from the Eagles?  Now we've got to take a commercial break.  Got to pay some bills.  I'll show you my stimulus package during the break.  Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho,  Nick DiPaolo, NickDip.com, BrianReagan, BrianReagan.com.  And then the fans go there and figure out what you're up to.  All right?  That's very crazy.  Jim Norton has no website because- 
[01:51:00]  What happened, Jimmy?  Just sucked.  What happened?  I had it taken down.  I had EatABullet.com taken down because it was being handled.  You don't need it.  Do you have Jim Norton?  I have to because MySpace is not as popular.  No, Jim Norton is being cyber squatter who I hope is at the funeral of a relative right now.  They won't let it go.  What happened to EatABullet?  I tried to send out another email blast and once again I got an error message and I've  talked to the company so many times, accurate imaging about it, and nothing ever got fixed.  Wow.  So I've taken it down.  I'm going to have it redone with another company.  I can't handle that anymore. 
[01:51:30]  Technology bites you in the ass.  It stinks.  It's constant.  Yeah, technology doesn't like it.  It holds the back of my head and gags me in my throat.  Yeah.  All right.  Wow.  It bites me in the ass to be friendly as opposed to the head hanging over the back of the bed I get.  You should explain it that way to the tech guy when he's working.  Let me explain what it feels like.  Now you fix that.  Technology pinches my nose and makes me swallow.  Yeah.  Can you fix that?  You got a tool that will fix that? 
[01:52:00]  Can you solder something?  Get the flux.  After the break, the Paul Abdul story.  It's terrific.  All righty.  Even if you don't give a crap about Paul Abdul, it's an amazing story.  We'll explain next.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  During the break, we're watching TV.  And, you know, the shows that should be talking about this crap we're talking about, they're doing other stuff.  Like, they're interviewing Muppets.  They're doing a whole look back at the 80s on another channel.  They're showing DeLorean. 
[01:52:30]  They're showing a DeLorean.  They just had Richard Simmons on the air.  Why?  I don't know.  What do you mean why?  He's ripped.  He's ripped, all right.  And I hear he needs a few stitches because of it.  Hard night last night.  Why are people buying into his crap year after year after year?  Not a hint of a muscle on this guy.  I thought we couldn't talk about him.  Oh, he can?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Him we can.  It was something else.  And we can talk about that other thing, too.  We just choose not to at this point. 
[01:53:00]  I think he lives on heavy cream and lasagna.  Yeah, but, man, how many years?  30 years has this guy been around doing this crap?  His dumb short shorts.  Sweating to the oldies.  Well, when is he going to sweat to anything?  He doesn't.  He just cries and tells people to spray stuff on their salad, and they'll lose weight.  Yeah.  You ever try that crap?  Spraying a little?  I don't know.  It doesn't work.  He tries the other way.  He sprays stuff on his face out of another dispenser. 
[01:53:30]  Yeah.  Then he rubs lettuce on it and eats it.  Holy jeez.  What kind of show is this?  Oh, my goodness.  How else are you supposed to get protein from your salad?  Yeah.  Oh, my goodness.  Not many calories.  No, but nickdip.com.  I want to say it on the air.  I say it every time Nick DePaul is in.  This guy should be on the radio full time, and he's not, which is just insane what this  business is doing to talented people.  Nick is one of the funniest people I know. 
[01:54:00]  Thank you.  As far as hanging out, like, you know, I mean, he's hysterical on stage, but I sat next to  Nick at Caroline's, and I laughed for about a half hour straight, man.  Nice.  So that comes from a guy.  When I first came to New York, Brian, I saw Brian at Catch Rising Star.  I was hanging out there.  Yeah.  You know, and I remember being, sticking my head in and seeing him, you were breaking  down a sentence, remember that bit?  And I almost packed my bags and went back to Boston.  I can't play with these guys.  I mean, and, you know.  I appreciate it. 
[01:54:30]  And he's doing a theater, and so is Jimmy, and, you know.  Yeah.  I'm doing a...  I'm just frustrated.  I'm doing a lobby.  Apparently, my racial angle's not working.  Yeah, well, I would show up.  I'd watch you in the lobby, man.  Thanks, Brian.  I'm just frustrated by the radio business, because this is a perfect time to do, like,  FM talk.  I mean, we have a black president, and the youth of America were the ones that voted  like crazy this time around.  It's perfect.  People want to talk about this stuff.  I know.  I know.  It's like, I don't know what they're doing in these corporate offices. 
[01:55:00]  I do.  They're playing the Eagles again.  Why?  Oh, kids and crap.  There's more important things.  Let's do something for Charlie Pride.  There's more important things going on in this country right now.  It's perfect.  It's perfect timing to bring back kind of like a young talk thing.  Do you like Charlie Pride?  I don't know where that came from.  I like Charlie Pride.  He's terrific, right?  Yeah.  Black country singer?  Yeah, he sang, oh, my God, the most beautiful, have you heard?  Girl in the world.  No, that's Charlie Rich.  And if you do it, oh, she's crying, crying, hey. 
[01:55:30]  No, Charlie Rich would say, what was the other song he had, most beautiful girl?  And the other one, he would say, take the ribbon from your hair.  He would say, oh, talk.  He had that awful, like, Hyman Roth thing with his K.  She loved to talk.  I don't remember that one.  Two syllables at that moment, and he had to stretch it out.  Talk.  We'll do that with some punchlines. 
[01:56:00]  Right, Pride?  If the money's on the table, I'll know we have a deal.  Talk.  If not talk.  What was the stupid song?  Um, I know what you're talking about.  I don't know, Jimmy.  We'll get it for you.  Somebody will call in.  Yeah, we'll get it for you.  Somebody white in the late 80s will have it.  Sure.  Hey, we've got to do the Paul Abdul story before we get out of here.  What happened?  Well, we're going to go backwards.  This crazy chick auditioned for American Idol a few years back, and we got a couple clips  from her audition, and then it leads to what happened to her today. 
[01:56:30]  I hope it wasn't bad.  You have to carry yourself a certain way.  You have to have a certain personality to be able to carry my look off.  Not anybody can do it.  And where on earth could she have gotten the inspiration for this style?  I really like Paul Abdul a lot.  She's really cool.  I'm like a really big fan, and I make life-size drawings of Paula.  Is this an Iraq?  I've been drawing ever since I was a little kid, and my first drawing was of Paula Abdul.  You know I am.  Brace yourself, Paula.  Your number one fan is on the way. 
[01:57:00]  Oh, she's got braces.  That's why he said brace yourself.  Remember that this one is a huge Paula Abdul fan.  Yeah.  All right, and then she finally meets Paula and the rest of the judges.  What's your name?  Paula.  Paula.  And my name.  You had it first, so, okay.  There's a similarity here.  Huh?  More than just the name.  Yeah.  The odor.  I can say there's a similarity.  There is?  Really?  Mm-hmm.  I think it's a compliment, because you're beautiful. 
[01:57:30]  No, I meant it as a compliment, yeah.  Oh, thank you.  Once again, she really likes Paula Abdul.  Does she ever.  She dresses like her.  How's this going to end, huh?  Oh, boy.  And what are you going to sing?  Proud Mary by Ike and Tina Turner.  Fabulous.  Oh, that was a mistake.  Oh, that's a good job in the city.  Work is all the men every night and day.  And I never lost one minute of sleep.  I wasn't worried about the way things might have been.  Babe, we'll keep on turning.  Proud Mary keep on burning. 
[01:58:00]  And we're rolling, rolling, rolling on a river.  Said we're rolling, rolling, rolling on a river.  Did she not hear the X?  There is a similarity.  Oh, stop it.  Oh, wow.  Wow.  Yeah.  Stop it.  Don't be funny.  Salt dog.  My goodness.  That was her audition.  That's what the judges had to say.  We're getting there.  We're almost there.  Paula.  Okay, I thought you meant me.  Oh, my God.  No, Paula and Paula.  She should be rolling on the river like Frederica Bimmel was. 
[01:58:30]  Speechless.  Don't know what to say.  Is it good or bad?  Is it a big fat girl?  No, it's not a great thing.  It's not a good thing by being speechless.  This time, no.  Okay.  No?  Randy?  That was terrible.  What was that?  But I don't think any artist on earth could sing with that much metal in your mouth anyway.  You have so much metal in your mouth.  She's got braces.  It's not so much metal.  Yeah, but it's metal.  It's braces. 
[01:59:00]  People have them.  People have braces.  Yeah, but can you sing with all those?  Yes.  Yeah, people can.  That's like a bridge.  I mean, it's...  What?  And finally, before we get to what happened today, she says goodbye.  I mean, I was pitchy on a couple of notes.  Big...  Pitchy?  There's a lot of people that I send to Hollywood that can't even really hold a note.  I mean, come on.  Yeah.  You know what?  It's not over.  I'm not going to stop singing just because you don't like my voice.  Yes, you will.  You sure will.  Well, fast forward a couple of years, and there's a cute little story coming out of L.A. today. 
[01:59:30]  Okay.  I heard her pitchy little voice.  Yeah.  Let me guess.  Tommy Mottola signed her?  Life ended Tuesday night.  Wow, that's...  What?  Here we go.  And this is where her life ended, Tuesday night, 200 feet from the front of Paula Abdul Sherman  Oak's home.  Oh.  A photo of her idol was hanging from the rearview mirror in the car where Goodspeed apparently  took an overdose of drugs.  Oh.  The personalized license plate read A-B-L-L-V, or Abdul Love. 
[02:00:00]  In Thousand Oaks, Goodspeed's mother was in seclusion, but neighbors spoke of her daughter's  unique appearance.  She seemed to be very pleasant.  You know, she...  From a distance, she looked just different just for her appearance, because she had strange  clothes.  You know, she had a lot of makeup.  She had some piercings, because when I was talking with her, she obviously had a tongue  kissing.  Well.  I had a similar experience. 
[02:00:30]  Wow.  That's...  That's upbeat.  Cute story.  A couple weeks ago, I took 20 Ambien in front of Shaka Khan's house from later her life.  Here's a little more to the story.  Some neighbors had noticed that Goodspeed was a fan of Paula Abdul's.  In passing, her drapes were always open, and I noticed a lot of pictures on the walls.  LAPD now confirming that over the past year, they were called several times to Paula Abdul's  home to deal with problems caused by Goodspeed. 
[02:01:00]  In one of those instances, she had overdosed on drugs.  She survived because paramedics got there just in time.  There you go.  So, the first couple was a cry for help.  Yeah.  That's creepy.  I don't know.  Get Paula Abdul on the phone.  I don't know how many pills I have.  How many...  Is this Paula?  Could you get...  That was her mistake.  Trying to get through to Paula, and time ran out.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I wonder how Paula's going to handle this.  She's not exactly stable herself. 
[02:01:30]  She's probably rifled through the girls' pockets for more pills.  Got to be some extra ones in here somewhere.  She couldn't have taken them all.  Selfish bitch.  Oh, that's tragic.  So, what else is in the news?  Yeah, whatever.  I'm with you on that.  Good.  Let's go to traffic.  Let's go to traffic.  Now it's time for traffic and weather together with Brian Regan.  That was horrible.  Paul Pierce had 34 points last night.  Celtics doing all right, man. 
[02:02:00]  A big game tonight, though.  You got the Pats and the Jets.  Yeah, I don't get the NFL network.  Do I?  We could get the game here in New York, can't we?  Well, I'm not going to pay for it.  Are you scaring me?  No, I'm not talking about paying.  I don't have the NFL network on my cable system up in Westchester.  We get it locally?  Yeah.  You don't get the...  I live in Westchester.  No, you got some...  They said I have to go up my roof and face towards Mecca with pinfoil wrapped on my abs and I might get the second half. 
[02:02:30]  Imagine biggest game of the year.  I'm going to be watching Northern Illinois.  West Boise on ESPN, too.  But I'll stay up for that.  I do love college ball.  Brian, didn't you play college ball, Brian?  Yes, I did.  Wow.  No, no, no, no.  Where?  Ohio.  Heidelberg College.  Is that right?  Yeah, he was a receiver, right?  See how impressed everybody is?  He was a fast white boy.  I was a wide receiver.  Really?  He had blinding speed.  Yeah.  Yeah, I was blinding.  Yeah, I caught a touchdown pass. 
[02:03:00]  See that?  You did.  All right.  That was it, huh?  Last Thanksgiving on the front lawn.  I caught one touchdown pass in college and one in high school.  That was it.  That was it.  That's your career.  I had a boy.  Yeah, but, you know, that was okay, I guess.  Did you really...  Were you hoping to, you know, be a football player?  No, no, no, no.  In fact, I'm glad I went to a small college because I wanted to be able to play.  I was able to play as a, you know, sophomore and stuff like that.  Sure.  So it was fun.  Well, I never would have had you pegged for a ball player. 
[02:03:30]  I don't remember hearing that.  I know.  We don't know what to say to you.  I played football in high school, but not in college.  I played in college.  You didn't play football, Jimmy.  I did.  No, you didn't.  You played in high school?  Yes.  No, you didn't.  Look at his eyes.  Jimmy used to break wedges for Notre Dame.  Nobody believes this.  The 12th man.  He was.  He was like Rudy of his time.  Rich Voss was a discus thrower.  Wow.  No, you're kidding, right?  Of course I'm kidding. 
[02:04:00]  That was just how Voss spelled disc.  That would be the worst.  That's so funny.  Nick, everyone's trying to tell you the game's on Channel 11.  Oh, is it?  You're saying in Westchester you don't get the game?  I don't get Channel 11 either.  Which is pretty close to New York.  I get one Channel 71, and that's it.  It's a terrible cable system.  And we got the Charlie Pryde song before we get out of here.  Oh, Channel 11.  What was it called, Mike?  That's when we get behind closed doors.  Which is he's, oh, how we talk. 
[02:04:30]  Now I gotta hear that.  You gotta hear it.  It's great.  Oh, how she loved to talk.  You got a great voice.  Yeah, that is.  I like that stuff.  That is.  Uh, Brad?  Yeah, guys.  Good evening.  It is that song.  Hey, Brad.  Hey, once we get behind closed doors, I believe.  You're right.  There you go.  Okay.  Well, where's the K in doors?  Help me out.  Well, he doesn't say the thing.  Jesus.  And it's something about talking.  When we get closed.  Hold on.  I'm looking at this.  You're thinking of the Yiddish version? 
[02:05:00]  Naked girls.  Thank you, Danny.  Is that Brian in the...  Oh, they had a football player.  Yeah, right.  It looked like...  Brian Rigelon.  It was me on the right.  Upper right.  You thought it was him in like a 1930s football card.  Oh, what is that on the upper right?  That's a naked woman.  That's Brian stretching his hamstrings.  That's my college football video.  That's him on the training table.  Somebody's rubbing bag bomb on his...  Jesus, is that a beautiful ass.  I got a full rod looking at the top of it. 
[02:05:30]  What comes out of that soft serve?  That's amazing.  That is...  Who is that?  That's Red Rum.  Red Rum.  She's a good egg.  Oh, I thought it was a guy.  I'm sorry.  I got a full rod.  No, she's a good egg.  There you go.  She's doing a little something extra for you right now.  Showing some ass.  I can't believe that has anything to the digestive system.  Do you?  It doesn't.  Where's my waffle cone?  All right.  Ouch.  I think we've done enough damage for one day.  Brian Regan's going to be in Kingston, New York tonight. 
[02:06:00]  Ulster Performing Arts Center.  And then you're just back and forth, back and forth.  It's a little confusing.  Boston on Friday.  At the Orpium Theater.  Yeah.  Stanford on Sunday.  Yep.  Atlantic City on Saturday.  Wow.  I don't like to say the day's in the right order.  No, I understand that.  That's about a half million dollar weekend, Brian.  Yeah, that's a Jesus H.  That's for you.  And then you got that DVD out too, man.  The Epitome of Hyperbole.  Yes.  In stores now.  Two biggest words I know.  Go to BrianRegan.com, NickDip.com. 
[02:06:30]  What else you got going on, Nick?  November 28th.  Please plug Tarrytown Music Theater.  You just did.  Perfect.  And I got a new CD coming out called Funny How.  So, I think there's free MP3s on my website.  So, you can check out a little...  NickDip.com.  Of Nick DePaulo's humor.  And Jimmy's all over the place too.  Yeah, I got my book signing tonight in Providence, Rhode Island, 6 o'clock.  It's pretty much the final one I'm doing.  It's at Borders, 142 Providence Place.  I've been there.  Very nice.  It's nice, right?  And tomorrow I'm in Boston with Regan, but he's on earlier. 
[02:07:00]  You're on, what, 8 o'clock show?  Yeah.  In Boston.  Oh, you're there tomorrow?  I got a 9.45 at the Wilbur.  All right, cool, man.  Go see both.  If you already have Regan tickets...  Go see Jimmy.  I wonder why it didn't sell out yet.  I'm like, I got like 40 tickets left.  I mean, I'm close to selling it.  And that explains why.  There's 2,000 of them being eaten up across the street.  Frick.  Good job, agent.  Look me against one of the biggest touring comics.  I'm like, I'm literally like across the street.  It's amazing.  They're going to hear his set coming through the wall. 
[02:07:30]  Do me a favor.  Give me that gig in Arkansas when Larry the Cable Guy is doing the arena.  Stupid zilch.  It's like when you go to the movie theater and you wish you were in the theater next door.  You heard that action move.  Yeah, right.  You're with your chick watching some dopey chick flick, and there's action and adventure  going on next door, the movie next door.  Hey, Ope, I'll be in a strategy room at noontime, too, at Fox.  Oh, really?  You're doing that again?  Great.  If they let me back in today.  Fox News.com, if you go to the strategy room. 
[02:08:00]  Fight back this time, Nick.  You're going to fight back.  Yeah, they didn't show that part of the clip.  It did.  All right.  I didn't get, you know, it really didn't bother me.  Another quick break, and we'll continue.  Opie and Anthony.  Nick DePaulo made the walk, and Brian Regan made the walk.  Yes.  I think he wanted to go to sleep, but I kind of said, come on, Brian.  Hey, you know, we don't get to see you often.  Why don't you come by for another set?  You guys are so nice.  How do you turn down an invitation?  So thank you.  It's going to be hard, because he's all sold out.  I know.  He doesn't even need to be here.  Why do I have to be here?  All I can do is ruin it. 
[02:08:30]  People are going to cancel their ticket.  Really?  Hey, it didn't sound funny to me.  Where's Nick DePaulo playing?  We had a nice discussion.  He had his house looking for the fuse box.  Yeah.  That's what I'm getting at.  Me, Brian, and Nick had a nice discussion about being homeowners.  Yeah.  And we're all the same person.  We don't know shit about our own places.  Yeah.  I don't like that.  It's not fun for me to own a home.  You know?  Yeah, yeah.  It's not a fun thing.  It's fun to have, like, a house and everything.  But to actually be the homeowner and have to... 
[02:09:00]  I do the absolute minimum at my house.  In the same way.  I can't do anything.  And it's too much for me.  Like, the other day, it was raining, and this will...  By elitist fucking me, this will sound great.  I have the cover on my pool, and there's pumps on it, on the top, because you can't  have water gathering on your pool cover.  Why not?  It makes for an ice rink, doesn't it?  Yeah, a little ice rink where the kids stomp or just trot upon it and fall in and drown 
[02:09:30]  and sue me for everything.  Exactly.  Watch Luke Costello cry.  Like the omen.  Yeah.  Luke Costello.  And if there's too many leaves get in there, in the pump, the pump's not going to pump  the water up.  Oh, boy.  That's a problem.  I have to go out there, no matter how cold it is, with like a janitor broom, and pull  the pump away, and then sweep the leaves off the cover.  Jesus, dude, why?  And then put the pump back.  And I'm like beside myself going, I'm working.  Yeah.  I'm working over here.  There's immigrants you can call.  I know, but they're not there while it's raining. 
[02:10:00]  Like today, it's going to be raining here in New York?  Yeah.  And I'll be out there, sweeping my pool cover.  If something breaks at my house, I am at the complete mercy of whoever walks through  that door.  Right.  Whatever they say goes.  That's a good feeling, ain't it, bro?  You know, I mean, I know nothing about whatever's broken, but I always put like one token bluff  in there.  You know, like the guy will come in, and he'll look at whatever the hell it is, you know, 
[02:10:30]  and he'll say, well, it looks like you're going to need to replace the whole thing,  and then I got to do my bluff.  Well, I was looking at it, and I was wondering if maybe you could just like fix that one.  Yeah.  And then he'll go, well, with your labor and the parts, you know, to fix that, you might  as well get a new one.  And then I'm done with my bluff.  I'm like, okay, go ahead.  We'll do a new one then.  I fold.  Yeah.  I'm out. 
[02:11:00]  I'm out.  And how much?  Whatever you say, whatever comes out of your mouth, I will pay you.  Yeah, whatever you say.  They know that, too.  You got to think.  It's probably just a rusty screw, and they make you replace the whole unit.  You don't know.  The guy could say, you know, it's $6,700, you know?  All right.  And they're all kind of angry, too, these guys.  They're not happy they're doing this shit.  They always have like an edge to them.  Never smile.  Oh, they're fucking kind of miserable.  Never, nothing.  Yeah.  Well, it's going to be this.  What do you think?  And they all have a different opinion. 
[02:11:30]  I've had like five guys come out, look at my, you know, my boiler, and they all shit  on the other guy's job.  They hooked that up wrong.  What the fuck?  That's all hooked up wrong.  What clown did you have come in here to do this shit?  Which is an insult to you, because you hired the last guy.  Yeah.  And paid him when he left and looked at the work and thought it was fine.  My house was built in 1937, so I'm supposed to know how the fucking, really?  I have to know where the two oil tanks are under my house?  But she's just the thinker of the wonderful times back then. 
[02:12:00]  I was just going to say that.  I don't know what you mean, Adam.  The nostalgia, you got to take that away with you.  Some wild shit went on in my house.  You didn't know where the history of that.  You didn't know where the fuse box was, Brian?  Electrical box.  Electrical box.  Yeah, that would be your breakers.  Your circuit breakers.  I don't even know what that is.  And this guy, you know, came in to fix something and says, where's the electrical box?  And I just had to say, I don't know.  It's the magic box of electricity?  Well, this guy looked at me like, how is it possible that you don't know where your electrical box is? 
[02:12:30]  I'm like, I don't even know what that means.  I don't know.  You know what?  I would tell him.  I called you to fix it.  Yeah.  So you have to find it and fix whatever.  Every second you come in the door, it's your job to find it and fix it.  It's not my fucking job.  Yeah, and he should know it's not going to be on the fucking dining room wall.  It's fucking, you know.  What do you got?  A closet or something.  You got a new house, right?  Relatively new house.  Yeah.  Something like that.  It's in the basement, you fucking asshole.  Or a dining room.  Yeah.  That was pretty fucking funny.  There it is. 
[02:13:00]  That would just hit home.  I just pictured you eating with a big fucking breakers just snapping behind you.  The big orange fluorescent thing on it.  You got the giant, you know, the giant spoon and fork that all the Italians have trying  to hide it.  Yeah.  Hang a potholder.  Put a big potholder on it.  A potholder.  You know, so it's a tuck on it.  Yeah.  What the fuck do you think this is?  It's in the basement, jerk off.  It's in the spice rack.  What the fuck?  I didn't go to school for it.  Look for it.  I tell jokes for a living and I got to do 20 minutes on you and you leave, you dink. 
[02:13:30]  Brian and Cherry Hill writes, I'm a new homeowner.  My bathroom fan stopped working.  It needed just to be cleaned.  I paid $168 for an electrician to do it.  Oof.  See?  Wow.  Just open the window and go like this with a times.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Woof.  I got major, major fucking work going on at my house now.  It's like major construction in the basement.  They're finishing the basement.  And all, I just hear banging noises and stuff and write checks. 
[02:14:00]  That's pretty much the extent to what I'm doing.  Banging and noises.  Banging and noises.  Banging and noises.  Banging and noises.  Banging and noises.  That's it.  All right.  Write another check.  It's not even working.  They could leave like a soundtrack down there and, you know.  Yeah.  Just let a tape play on a loop.  And they crawl out the basement window and you're just hearing bonk, bonk, bang.  They go into their truck, throw some sawdust in their hair and come to the door.  Check.  What the fuck is happening?  3,400.  Actually, I have a mic set up.  What?  Yeah. 
[02:14:30]  I'm hooking my house up so I never have to leave it is what I'm doing.  Really?  We didn't know that.  I'm so tired of society.  Society.  I hate it, man.  I'm just building an oasis in my house.  Home theater's going in downstairs, which is an actual movie theater.  Because I got tired of going to the movies.  I can't fucking sit in a movie theater with soulmates.  Believe me.  None of us.  God bless you got the money to do that.  I can't take it.  I can't handle people talking and opening up their snack. 
[02:15:00]  How can it take like five minutes to open up a cellophane wrapper?  Just rip the thing open, you know, and get it over with.  And you hear, you hear, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click.  Are you trying to make it, like, less obvious?  Yeah.  I couldn't take the movies anymore.  Were they shocked the workers when you said, put the whites only sign.  I need two drinking fountains, please, down here. 
[02:15:30]  One that has water and one that has arsenic.  But it's an actual theater.  It's not even one of those home theater where it's like, I got a home theater.  You got your TV and then you sit on the couch and watch this is movie theater seats.  It's going to look like an art deco movie.  Really?  Something from the 30s.  I want that whole look going through.  Can we come and die when it's French?  Of course, please.  I'll need friends.  I want to see Schindler's List.  I have nothing.  And then in that, you leave the theater and then there's a bar because I'm tired of going to fucking bars. 
[02:16:00]  So I'm going to have my own bar in the basement and TV set up for sporting events and whatnot.  Bathrooms down there.  That's where we're headed.  A video and audio recording studio we're going to have down there.  So that at some point, I hope I'm probably going to get a line down there and do the show from my basement.  Oh, really?  And then I will never have to leave.  There's other shows that have done this and I'm like, of course that's what we're going to do eventually. 
[02:16:30]  I have a big monitor.  You'll have one here.  Tom Bernard in Minneapolis.  That's right.  We'll talk to each other.  I'll look at the big monitor.  We'll see.  We'll do the show that way.  And then my door, I'm just going to weld it shut.  I'm going to weld my fucking doors shut.  I did a show like that one time where the hosts weren't there.  The hosts were like at their house.  And I'm like, what the hell do I got to be here for?  And they're like, well, pretend like they're here.  Oh, I got to sit here while they're like in.  Were you just talking to TV?  I just did it two weeks ago in Minneapolis.  Tom Bernard.  Really?  At his house. 
[02:17:00]  But you have to come to the studio.  Yeah, you go into the studio and sit there.  Why can't you just fall into that?  And I was really overdoing it.  I was like, why?  You look good, man.  It's a nice tan.  I was just really piling it on.  Jesus, those shoes.  What do those cost?  Those are nice, man.  So it's just you in a studio with this asshole at home?  And like, well, his sidekick still had to come in and he produces and shit.  There's a few shows like that.  What's the one out in L.A.?  That's the one city I sell tickets in.  The one in L.A. does that now.  Adjust the hue and tell him he looks a little peaked. 
[02:17:30]  Yeah.  He looks a little green.  I was going, you know.  That's fucking, that's got to be a little awkward, though, talking to a monitor like that.  Who is that right?  There wasn't even a monitor.  No, you're just like doing a phoner?  Yeah.  You know what?  All the sudden, I don't monitor nothing.  It was your show and you were interviewing the host.  When you said monitor, do you mean like visual?  Yeah, I thought you were able to see him.  No, no, no.  So he's just in his drawers there at home.  In his house, yeah.  Sitting around scratching his balls.  And you've got to pretend like you see the guy across from you.  Yeah, hey.  That sucks. 
[02:18:00]  Wow, that's rough.  It's already like the easiest job in America.  Now it's-  Show up.  Just at least show up.  You just got to show up and talk.  How hard is this?  Also weird is when you-  That's my dream, man.  Sometimes you do a phoner.  You do a phoner.  You call in and they tell you that they're taping it to pretend like it's three days from  now.  Yeah.  And my brain isn't good at that.  Oh, that's got to be great.  I have to lie.  Yeah.  Hey, did you see that thing two nights ago on TV?  How about that nuclear bomb that went off those terrorists? 
[02:18:30]  How about that bomb that's going to go off on Wednesday?  Yeah.  That's going to be something.  Yeah, and it'll sound really good as you're doing bits and there's some kind of world  catastrophe.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  And you're making light Pop-Tart jokes.  You got to know about the big calamity?  Calamity.  How can we stop talking about the calamity?  Fucking radio stinks.  Have we lived through a calamity, you think?  Was 9-11 the calamity? 
[02:19:00]  9-11 was a calamity.  Do you think that's a calamity?  Jesus, I guess.  Officially, Katrina was a calamity.  Tsunami, the fucking-  For them.  Yeah, those are the calamities.  Fucking-  The further away the calamity, the less people care.  Who's the boss?  Calamity is my new favorite word.  I love a good calamity.  Calamity.  Calamity.  That's an old west word.  It's a calamity Jane.  Yeah.  She must have been a pisser.  Yeah.  Hey, calamity.  The hell came for that name?  That was a calamity Jane, wasn't it?  A slight mishap Jane. 
[02:19:30]  It's a calamity.  Chlamydia Jane.  And you got-  They just mixed up the fucking words.  You got the movie theater, you got the bar.  What about the strip club?  Well, uh-  I've seen that basement.  You got room for a strip club, too.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm thinking maybe the bar, if I could-  Well, we got the strippy pole that we don't use here.  Maybe we could take it down there.  Take it, yes.  I got that little part of the wall that goes in.  Maybe we could put it there, and that'll be right near the bar.  You gotta get one of those showers.  The part of the wall that goes in.  Shower?  Isn't that called the corner?  Yeah, well, it's-  It's where two walls meet, and it goes in. 
[02:20:00]  You haven't seen this house.  It would be a big house, and he finally got to the corner of it.  Yeah.  No, a stripper shower.  Not a regular shower, a stripper shower.  No, it's just a pole.  Fuck them.  Where are you gonna get the girls?  No, I mean, legitimately, really, fuck them.  You could bring them up to your room and have them fucking-  Oh, I got a big shower in there.  You get an elevator?  Ah, wow.  How about an elevator?  That would be an elevator.  Right down to the basement.  Get a freight elevator for the fat ones. 
[02:20:30]  For the pigs.  You gotta get the Batman entrance, so they don't know how to get to your house.  It's such a guinea house, though.  Like, I had to incorporate real guinea things into it.  Marano glass?  Like, when you walk in the front door, Angela, who is Keith's wife, she did all the decorating  in the house, because I was just fucking waste.  I'm not gonna sit there and look at swatches.  I'm not gonna look at pink chips and see what the fuck-  It's not your job.  That's for women and fans.  That's it.  Just-  Exactly.  You do it.  I'll pay. 
[02:21:00]  I just want it done.  And she did a fantastic fucking job.  So, I said, I want a chandelier in the entranceway, because it's very high.  It's a big double door thing.  I want this, like, a grand entranceway.  So, she's showing me these things, and they were like this wrought iron thing or something  else, and I was like, nah.  You don't seem to understand my heritage and my background.  I want the biggest, gaudiest, crystal fucking chandelier.  And now I got this giant thing.  And the place where the mount is, is kind of inset. 
[02:21:30]  Oh, wow.  And I said, I want it painted like gold.  I want this gold.  So, it's just pure guinea.  Pure fucking guinea.  He could have weddings in his house.  I had to have that.  There's Roman columns in there.  Oh, I love it.  It's like columns.  Inside.  I was just sitting there.  Yeah, inside, I have columns.  What's painted gold?  The inset, there's like an octagon-shaped inset.  Yeah, what a fucking Ginzel.  Oh, it is.  I want the living room to look like the Coliseum. 
[02:22:00]  That's what I want.  I'm like Caligula with a fistful of lard.  You stand between them like Samson and pretend you're going to knock this fucker down.  You should open your house for wedding photos, man.  People would appreciate that.  Yeah, I bet.  I can't wait to see it.  Fuck it.  Oh, it's a fun place.  You know what it is?  The columns are there because they cover up lolly columns.  Because I want open room.  I want a lot of...  I don't like a house where you feel like you're in a maze.  It's a lot of hallways and walls and shit.  So this thing is like really open. 
[02:22:30]  And in order to do that, they had to put these columns on to hold the beams up.  And then they had to surround them with something.  So fucking Roman columns.  That's what I want.  I'm putting a Coliseum in the backyard so I can fucking...  There's a fucking tiger in the kitchen.  Tigers and Christians and gladiators.  I really did just go all out.  I'm a fucking piece of Long Island white trash that got lucky.  Fuck that.  Good for you.  That's pretty much it.  You got some Howard Hughes in you too, bro.  What?  That I piss in jars and leave them all over the house? 
[02:23:00]  Call me in...  You Hershey boys?  A little Howard Hughes.  Let my nails grow really long and filthy.  I walk on tissues.  Did he really?  Yeah.  He was a crazy guy.  I know he's a germ nut.  Wait, he walked on tissues?  Yeah, he'd put tissues on the floor and walk on them and there were tissues everywhere.  He roped off areas where he would walk and everything else was just fucking trashed.  He had a certain amount of directives that you needed to open the cabinets or the tuna  can.  You had to have five cushions of napkins. 
[02:23:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Really fucked up.  I think it was Kleenex.  I was just watching a documentary.  Kleenex, yeah.  And I think he sent out a memo to his staff saying the proper amount of layers of Kleenex  that you need to touch stuff was eight.  Eight.  Eight layers of Kleenex to open doors, open cabinets.  He was fucked up.  Sounds like an easy guy to live with.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Was he like normal before that?  I mean, there's footage of him acting like a normal human being when he flew the plane  and everything.  Yeah, yeah.  Did he become a nut or was he always like that?  I think I'm over time.  Probably got married.  He was kind of always crazy like that, from the movie anyway. 
[02:24:00]  I don't know how accurate that was, but his mother kind of fucked him up.  He showed signs in high school.  He used to bring a shit sandwich to school.  For lunch.  Apparently he was an engineering genius.  Yeah, he was really smart.  He worked three days at a time and then collapsed for 24 hours.  He was crazy.  Good life.  Yeah, he would just stay up and he would buy out contracts of these Hollywood actresses  that he was obsessed with.  And then just have them watch movies. 
[02:24:30]  Like he would just make them watch movies all day, but he wanted to possess them.  He's like an OCD, obviously a fucking OCD nut in a lot of areas.  That's me.  Yeah, what a great job.  He did have his own screening room and I think he went down there to screen some movies  and he didn't leave for like six months.  I heard he just kept watching Ice Station Zebra over and over and over again.  What's that movie about?  I don't know.  I bet you he knows.  Yeah, he knows.  But that gets me fucking weirded out because I'll watch the same movies over and over again.  I've been fun of.  You don't like to see me, but I can't. 
[02:25:00]  Me too.  Practical Magic with Sandra Bullock?  Come.  I got it.  I got it on a loop.  I watch the same movies over and over again.  Like at night, if I'm going to sleep, I need something on.  I can't just have silence or I sit there and just have my own thoughts, which I can't sleep to.  I can't do that.  Bill Curtis and his voice puts me in a coma.  I put those on.  Bill Curtis.  Knocked me out like fucking ambient.  5 p.m.  So wait, do you watch the movie?  In the town of Pomona, California.  Do you watch the movie over and over again in the same night? 
[02:25:30]  No, no, no.  Not on the same night.  But like if two nights goes by and I go to bed and I want to like go to sleep, I don't  want to put something on that I haven't seen or I'm going to be up watching the thing.  So I put on something I've seen a thousand times.  That's right.  So Gladiator will be on.  And I'll fucking just, you know, put on Gladiator.  Jerk off real quick.  Look at that.  Yeah.  Get a whip off a quick batch.  Of course, Back to the Future.  If that's on, I'll put that on.  I'll put on mindless, you know, movies.  Alien or Aliens.  Either one. 
[02:26:00]  Those.  I'll put them on over and over again.  I hate seeing the same movie again and again.  Oh, no.  I've watched it a thousand times.  That's why I quote this shit.  Well, I'll take a long break, like six months to a year, and then maybe pop it in again.  No, I'm talking a couple of days can go by.  I'll watch the same fucking movie.  I need like five years, man.  Five or ten years.  If I see a movie, even if I love it, it's like, I don't want to see it again.  Oh, no.  That's why I don't understand, like, when you buy the DVD, it's like, I already saw the thing.  No, I saw it, but... 
[02:26:30]  I know, doesn't it imagine that people will buy your DVDs and shit?  No, but seriously, as a comic, I don't mean that.  I didn't mean that in a distance.  No, but you know what I mean?  Hey, that's true.  You know what I mean?  I didn't mean that.  Like, you know what I mean?  No, no.  Even a CD.  Well, they sell, you know, like they'll air a special and then you can buy it.  And it's like, obviously it works in my favor that people would.  But yes, I think that's kind of unusual.  The worst is on, like, the History Channel does a thing where, you know, and then Hitler 
[02:27:00]  shot himself in the bunker and had his troops burn himself.  And the credits start rolling.  It's like, if you want to purchase what you just watched, go to history.com and you can  purchase the DVD.  It's like, I just watched it.  And taped it.  And it's not going to end different.  I almost fell for that.  Hitler escapes in this version and runs off.  Yeah, it's like legend.  There's a different fucking...  Played by Jude Law.  Yeah, different ending.  An alternate ending to World War II.  Hitler goes to Brazil and lives happily ever after.  Takes a wacky balloon ride with fucking Benny Hill music. 
[02:27:30]  While the Jews chase him with their fists in the air.  Using Jews as ballast.  Well, I would buy it if it was a different.  Drop another Jew.  We have to go higher.  Jesus.  Yes, bro.  Oh, my God.  Fuck him.  We'll fight him.  Fucking guy's getting fresh over here, Jimmy.  Fucking fresh.  You're getting fucking fresh.  Ruined my party.  He had eight murders under his belt by that point.  He's getting fresh. 
[02:28:00]  He had a party.  Ruined my party.  His party.  Three fucking people.  That's my new phrase.  Ruined my party.  Ruined my party.  Horrible balloon.  Anytime somebody gets me mad.  Don't get nervous.  Don't get nervous.  I like that.  Don't get nervous.  He tells the broad.  At his party.  The one broad.  Oh, look at this.  The stock market's lost over.  What did it say?  Three trillion dollars.  What did it say?  Wow.  That has to be trillion.  Yeah.  We're all.  Jesus Christ.  It's just opening right now.  Yeah.  Well, it means time for me to pop up my E-Trade account. 
[02:28:30]  Good luck.  I should have fucking.  I should short sell that goddamn Google.  I'm chicken shit.  Because I'm chicken shit.  I know the second I do it, it's going up.  Yep.  You got to short sell it.  Nothing's going up.  I've told you that.  I should have.  I would have made a fortune.  You fucking close you a half.  It's down in the 200.  It broke through the 300 barrier.  It's all about the puts.  Yep.  Puts.  Put options.  That means making money even if the stock tanks.  I'll short sell.  I'll short sell.  To kids.  You can't lose.  Just say it's all about the puts.  So close to kids.  And you sound intelligent. 
[02:29:00]  It's all about the puts.  They shouldn't allow people to be making money off it losing money.  Yes.  I agree.  Everybody should be voting for it to make money.  No, but you can.  If people are betting on it losing.  If you're bearish.  How do you do that?  I'd like to bet.  Here's what you do.  You have a stock.  I've explained this before, but I love explaining it to people.  Let's say you buy.  Their stock is $10 a share.  There's a stock.  It's $10 a share.  It ain't serious.  Oh, shut up.  It's any stock.  It's Widgets.  Widgets Incorporated.  All right.  $10 a share.  Yes, how about Ted's Hat Emporium? 
[02:29:30]  I sell 10 shares of that stock.  I don't even own the fucking stock.  I don't own it.  But I could sell 10 shares that I don't even own.  How does that work?  You're just allowed to do it.  That's goddamn juice.  So I go on and I sell 10 shares.  I make $100 because I sold 10 shares at $10 a share.  So I made $100.  I got $100.  But now the people are going, wait a minute.  You didn't own those shares.  You got to pay us back for those shares.  I go, okay, I'll pay you back.  I wait a little while. 
[02:30:00]  I wait.  The price of the share goes down to now $5 a share.  So now I pay them their $50 for the shares.  And I'm holding $50 going, ha, ha, I fucking won.  I got $50 profit.  Even that little bit of logic throws me.  How does that help, though?  And we wonder why, yeah, the economy's in the share.  What if it goes up?  What if it goes up?  If it goes up, then you have to replace the shares at a higher price than you fucking paid for it.  And you're fucked.  But how can you do that if you don't have the money? 
[02:30:30]  So you start with $0.  Then you sell the stock for whatever.  And then the price goes up.  Usually you can't start with $0.  You got to put the money in escrow.  It's a margin account.  But you have to put more?  Because what if the price goes up?  Yeah, you need money.  It could theoretically go up above what you have.  And then it's called a margin call.  And then they come knocking and say, hey, and if you then don't pay them, they sell off your assets. 
[02:31:00]  Buy the land.  They're not making any money.  And they will sell off other stocks.  There's a time limit, too.  At any price.  Yeah, yeah.  So you could even wait how long?  I don't know.  It all depends on...  Like, I could buy options for any month.  I could buy options for fucking next January if I want.  So you have until next January to pay them back.  And if it either goes up or down, I have to either sell it or exercise my options.  So somewhere between now and next January, you can decide when to sell it back.  When to sell or buy the stock or something.  So why are we all rich?  That seems like an easy one. 
[02:31:30]  It was back in 99 and then...  Or 98 and then 99, 2000 hit.  And I was up about $90,000.  Nice.  And, ooh, it all went down the shitter in a month.  Ooh, not nice.  Ouch.  I was selling options on vacation at Disney.  Dude, you used to...  I woke up and I was like, option, option.  Oh, right.  I made 20 grand.  Paid for the vacation.  Fucking that, I believe.  What kind of options at Disney?  Hiney ointment for youngsters?  Yes.  At NAW, he was day trading.  We would be doing the radio show.  But we were doing afternoons, so... 
[02:32:00]  And I'd be ranting and raving about something, and I'm looking at Ant to come on board with  my rant, and he's like, yeah, yeah, that's good, that's good.  Trying to get out of stocks.  I'm like, come on, sell, fucking sell this, go through.  And Brian, I'm like, oh my God, he's not paying attention.  But it was afternoon, so it was like, you know, 4.30, the market closed, so...  That's an important time, yeah.  I knew the show officially...  It was an hour.  The first hour was going to suck.  I was going to say, the show officially started for us at 4.31.  The first hour was really going to blow.  No one knows that, but I guess we can tell them now.  You're clicking in the background, clicking and clacking. 
[02:32:30]  It's like, come on, it's going through, I've got to sell now, the price is falling.  Anything else on your mind there, Brian?  Oh.  Anything else bothering you out there?  I don't understand the economy stuff, man.  Yeah.  The mortgage meltdown, I have friends try to explain it to you, but they talk to you like  you're a little kid.  Yeah.  I hate when they're condescending and say, Brian, Brian, it's very simple, right?  You have a mortgage, right?  I'm like, yeah, I got that.  And you pay your mortgage to the bank, right?  Yeah, I got that. 
[02:33:00]  They bundle those with other risky securities and sell those to speculators, right?  Okay, I'm gone.  Yeah.  Am I supposed to still be with you because I'm way gone at this point?  No, a lot of people aren't.  Even people on TV that talk about it don't get that shit.  Seriously.  What the hell does that mean?  What does that mean?  No one knows, yeah.  How do you, you bundle them together, how?  Who, with a rubber band?  I don't know what...  What is it, asparagus or starch?  It is true.  It's very...  No one could explain it.  I don't get it.  It's the only way to get the prime rate down is if you're going to... 
[02:33:30]  Prime rate.  There it goes.  He's gone.  I have no idea.  There's no way to really explain that fucking finance thing.  Holy shit.  Speaking of...  Oh, yeah, they're back again.  The scaffold guys.  They just jerk off looking at us angrily.  I can't believe there's not a better way to clean windows.  Every fucking six months, one of these things snaps.  These guys are cleaning this window every day.  We don't know why.  What?  Do you think in 2000?  We took their spies.  That's what I'm saying, Anthony.  They should do it from the street with lasers.  Yes.  Or a hovercraft.  Yes.  Should be fucking high above the city. 
[02:34:00]  But now there's still fucking cables, pulleys.  It really is.  You're risking your life to clean a fucking window.  Seriously.  You fucked.  You realize?  They have a safety harness.  But there's something else going on here.  The harness is connected to the thing that falls.  Yeah, which is hysterical.  There's an anvil on top.  A piano.  We think this is the CIA, because they're cleaning this window every day and taking a  peek inside the studio.  How dirty is it?  We're a little paranoid by these guys.  It's not even level.  It's like at a certain angle, man.  I think I see Bubba the Love Sponge on it. 
[02:34:30]  On one side.  Yeah, it's tilting.  Left.  That would horrify me.  Hey, Jim, you want to moon him today?  Why would you risk your life to clean a fucking window?  We moon him every once in a while.  No, because in my complaint to the building, we're already here.  Oh, there he goes.  They're straightening it out now.  All right, well.  Look at these guys.  Why do you do this?  What floor are we on?  Uh, 47.  All right, look.  We're only on the fifth floor.  I know.  But after four floors, it really doesn't matter.  You're dead anyway.  After 30 feet, you get a 50-50 chance.  That's it?  Yeah, that's it.  Wow.  After 30 feet? 
[02:35:00]  How about the guy that fell 48 stories with his brother, remember?  He fucking lived!  He lived!  He lived!  I think he knocked the wind out of himself.  Jesus Christ!  How do you fall that fucking foot?  Well, they were on like a piece of...  They were on the platform...  It had to be going down...  It wasn't going down full speed.  It couldn't have been, right?  Oh, yeah.  No, it fell full speed.  His brother died instantly.  But, yeah, there was a platform made of wood.  A piece of plywood that kind of got wind resistance.  Oh, okay.  But still, I mean, I don't get...  Slowed him down like a parachute. 
[02:35:30]  It's not like a fucking magic carpet.  I mean, it's cool.  He fell like the feather in Forrest Gump.  His brother was dead instantly.  Aladdin just landed softly.  He got pretty fucked up, but he's now walking around like nothing happened.  Hey, uh...  That's a long way down, man.  That's a long way down.  Anthony, really fast, because we're talking about stocks.  We're almost at a milestone.  Nick from Pittsburgh is keeping track.  You guys are getting close to a milestone.  Citadel stock is almost one-one-hundredth the price you guys paid for it. 
[02:36:00]  So he wants to congratulate us.  It's down at...  Look how smart we are, Brian.  We got in on what's called an IPO, my friend.  Oh, my God.  We got in with Citadel stock for $19 a share.  That's right.  And I decided to go all in.  Attaboy.  You bought a share.  Oh, yeah.  I had one whole share.  It's now at 21 cents a share.  See, that's a fucking huge difference, man.  That's great.  Oh, wow.  That thing is at...  See, you should have done the selling thing.  That you were...  25 cents or something. 
[02:36:30]  What is it at?  21.  21 cents.  And dropping.  We bought it $19.  Is that bad, though?  No, it's great.  No, it's wonderful.  Guys.  What's the product?  It's a radio.  You know, something we should know about.  Radio.  And we got in on an IPO, which is the initial public offering, which means we got in before  the public was even allowed to buy.  How much did it go up to?  So we got the cut rate price.  Once, it went up to $22 a share for a tenth of a second. 
[02:37:00]  It never went higher than that, right?  No.  I don't think it did.  I put 40 grand into an alpaca farm.  Well, we might as well have.  We thought we knew radio, but I guess we didn't.  I either want to get into Amway or a pyramid scheme.  Right.  Where's a good old Ponzi scheme when you need one?  Nice chain letter.  Yeah, chain letter.  Where are the good old time investments?  You know, if you get...  No, because when you reach the top of the pyramid, everyone's got to pay you. 
[02:37:30]  Really?  I bring a grand to fucking a VFW hall, and who was falling for this shit?  A lot of people.  A lot of money in a white pot of pop.  For a while.  All right.  The food has arrived, so we're going to take a quick break.  Brian's staying going.  I'll stay.  Oh, look at that.  Brian Regan.  Have fun, man.  I'm learning how to fix my house.  You still live in the...  You don't live in a city no more.  Vegas.  No.  Las Vegas.  Vegas.  BrianRegan.com for all his dates.  Which one do you want to push right now? 
[02:38:00]  Kingston tonight.  Boston tomorrow.  Atlantic City Saturday.  Stamford, Connecticut Sunday.  Perfect.  You nailed it.  The back and forth tour.  For Nick DiPaolo.  Opie and Anthony, we'll continue.  Opie and Anthony, we've got Jennifer on the line.  All right.  We're going to have a serious moment here, fellas.  Are we?  Jennifer in Alabama.  What's going on?  Hey.  I was hoping y'all could call my husband.  He has cancer and he is out in Texas. 
[02:38:30]  And he loves you guys.  And I was hoping y'all could wish him a happy birthday.  How old is he?  He's 41 today.  Oh, jeez.  Will he make it to 42?  That's sad.  Where is he?  We're trying.  I missed it.  He's in Texas.  She's in Alabama.  It's his birthday and he's got the cancer.  What kind of cancer?  He has, it's leukemia.  How come you're in different locations?  Because we just had a new baby.  And I couldn't travel. 
[02:39:00]  Oh.  Yeah, but he's got cancer.  I know.  You don't have to tell her.  I think she knows.  What's the prognosis?  Well, his doctor says if he does what he's supposed to, he can be cured.  What's that, pray?  It's hard.  Yeah, at least that's still working.  Oh, wow.  Sorry.  All right, so what's his name?  Why don't you say happy birthday to him?  Because we don't know him from a hole in the wall.  What?  His name's Andrew.  Andrew, happy birthday. 
[02:39:30]  Andrew, Godspeed.  Best of luck to you.  Really, Andrew.  Oh, why don't you give him some words that maybe make him feel good.  What?  People could, maybe he needs, you know, best wishes, something like that.  You know, hope for the future, something.  I'm starting to believe in that karma thing.  Oh, are you?  Finally, yeah.  You don't want to give him the old GLB? 
[02:40:00]  No.  I'll tell the story to these guys.  All right.  Hey, Jennifer, thanks.  I hope everything works out for you guys.  Andrew, happy birthday.  Do what the doctors are telling you, please.  Yes.  All right.  Thank you so much.  Medical care.  Goodbye, madam.  Good luck.  Alabama has got to be there.  Oh, you know what?  They'll always cheer somebody up when they're sick.  What?  A copy of I Hate Your Guts.  Oh, boy.  That's true.  What is better for a man who's not feeling too well than a book to laugh at?  I don't know.  Temotherapy. 
[02:40:30]  Yeah.  Aside from that.  It's a known fact.  Laughs cure cancer.  That's right.  If you didn't learn that from Patch Adams, you learned nothing.  And he probably literally hates his guts because they, you know, they have cancer.  Well, and could you make sure his XM unit's paid up for the next year?  We could use the subscriptions.  Yeah.  You guys are fucking cold as either.  That is really cold.  All right.  We listen to you going down the road, on the laptops, wherever.  By the nuclear power plant.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Stop giving us all locations.  During chemo, where else? 
[02:41:00]  On the toilet, in the kitchen, in the basement.  Right.  Right.  We get it.  Exactly.  Just hope his last name isn't Piccolo.  Oh, my God.  Unless it's Jenny and I can fuck her.  Who didn't love old slutty Jenny Piccolo?  Every time she sneezed, a cum bubble fell into linoleum.  Fucking Fonzie loved her.  Even the big ragu would slide on the floor and eat her pussy real quick as he went by.  Singing a happy tune.  Yeah.  From rags to riches.  They fucked it for everyone, though, man.  Because she was like this mystery.  And then they finally showed you what Jenny Piccolo looked like. 
[02:41:30]  Exactly.  She sucked.  What are you guys talking about?  Stupid happy days.  Stupid happy days.  Slutty friend, Jenny Piccolo.  Jenny Piccolo.  I don't remember Jenny Piccolo.  Yeah, she was in the later episodes when everybody left.  I remember Patsy having a nice ass, but I don't remember Jenny Piccolo.  It's like when everyone leaves a show and they try to go on a couple more seasons, but  no one's there anymore.  And they take the fake phone call.  Mrs. Cunningham will be like, oh, it's Richie.  He's on the phone.  And she would just talk.  And you're supposed to imagine she's on the phone.  No, he's not.  He didn't want to be part of this horse shit anymore. 
[02:42:00]  Exactly.  These guys weren't principal members to begin with.  Yeah, he's supposed to be still a college kid with a chrome dome.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Everyone's saying good luck, bro, to Andrew, Jennifer.  I did not say it, though, myself.  Could someone make the font a little smaller on the phone thing?  Holy shit.  I'm seeing three words of what is being screened.  Might as well not type.  What is this, the future?  We're still doing our show in our 70s, and we have to get the big font. 
[02:42:30]  I can't see so good.  Make it bigger.  It's like the font on a gas station sign.  Right.  Yeah.  That's better.  It's like half a message.  Guy with gun is coming, and then it stops.  Right, right, right.  All right, Jennifer, good luck to you, Andrew, and the rest of your family.  All right?  Thank you so much.  We love you.  I love that action.  God bless.  What Anthony's referring to, Brian, when Peter Jennings had cancer, the lung cancer that eventually  killed him, I was in Central Park. 
[02:43:00]  And here comes Peter Jennings.  He's weighed maybe 120 pounds at this point.  He's got, I believe, his two kids helping him.  He's going for a little walk in the park, and I'm like, here's my moment to say something  to Peter Jennings.  And the best I could do was give him a thumbs up and go, good luck, bro.  That was all I could come up with.  He died the next day.  Yes, he shot himself after hearing that.  Good luck, bro.  No, and it really helped, because he was gone in no time.  But I saw him coming for at least two or three minutes. 
[02:43:30]  I'm like, all right, I really want to say something to this guy.  Can you imagine if his white salt count went up right after you said that?  Ah.  So that's the famous good luck, bro.  You never say to somebody, that might be sick.  It's a good sentiment, though.  You know what I mean?  You could have been worse.  At least it was a positive thing.  Yeah, he might as well talk to a news legend like he's a fucking 17-year-old surfer.  Yeah.  Good luck, bro.  Fucking Beach Mahalo.  Hang 10, buddy.  Give him the old pinky thumb shake.  I did give him a thumbs up, though.  Thumbs up, good luck, bro, to Peter Jennings. 
[02:44:00]  That worked.  The legend.  I think he took that well.  That's the one that's...  Oh, are you fucking waving that this way, you motherless fuck?  Oh, Jimmy, again with the farting.  I get upset at the bad news.  Is that what it is?  That's how upsetness goes away.  Before it was nerves.  Nerves and anger cause it.  Whenever I get upset, the sadness has to come out.  Jesus Christ.  So the good feelings push the sadness away.  I thought you pushed the fear out.  Everything makes...  There's a lot of causes.  Right.  Everything makes them shit but food.  Why does the sadness have to be wearing a diarrhea coat? 
[02:44:30]  You know what it is?  The sadness rolls around in my body and takes all the impurities away.  Sorry, I saw a good-looking girl.  I couldn't help it.  Your sadness is awful.  What's the matter?  It's partly cloudy.  I was sad at the weather.  Hey, there's a sale over at Macy's.  Fucking Jimmy.  My body always tells the truth.  It responds to every stimulus.  Anything. 
[02:45:00]  Anything.  Hey, I got a question for Brian.  It's my father's birthday tomorrow.  Whoa, check out that sports headline.  Brian, you like tits?  Oh.  Yeah.  Yeah, I do.  Good, good, good, good.  We got a little plus column.  We got a little tits story.  I'm going to be in the plus column.  Yeah, you know, people like tits.  I like them, too.  Sure.  They're two lines.  I'll be in the line of the people that like them.  Happy day.  We got a nice tits story for everybody.  All right.  Hey.  Hey.  The holidays are coming up.  Happy day.  What better time than a... 
[02:45:30]  It's cool.  Holidays are coming up.  It is one of the most recognizable brands in lingerie.  But Victoria's Secret is now defending its popular brand.  Against allegations, some of its bras may have made women sick.  Roberta Ritter claims she bought...  Come on.  The radioactive bra.  Woof.  Yeah.  Woof.  As that came out...  Plutonium brand.  You know what?  The trans fats in the cups?  Come on, bucks.  How does a bra make you sick? 
[02:46:00]  Well, there's tacks on the inside to hold it to your tits.  Yeah, that might fucking have something to do with it.  Yeah, let me try on that Ebola bra.  That's how it holds onto your nipples.  It's fucking monkey teeth.  It's clamped down on your fucking nipples.  It's not an underwire.  It's an under monkey teeth.  Oh, Jesus.  Yes.  May have made women sick.  Roberta Ritter claims she bought bras at this Ohio mall 
[02:46:30]  and that her angel's secret embrace in very sexy extreme me push-up bras  triggered a terrible reaction.  I had the welts and the very red hat to the touch.  Hat to the touch?  Extremely inflamed like blissful.  History.  It itched profusely.  I was just utterly sick.  Fuckhead.  You guys hear the name of the product?  The extreme me push-up bra.  There you go.  You love yourself a little much.  Self-indulgent.  So, how does it make you sick? 
[02:47:00]  It must be some allergic reaction she's having.  It's formaldehyde, right?  Isn't it in the article it says it's formaldehyde or something?  The big reveal before he got there.  Give this jar to Mel.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I did radio every day.  I wouldn't be making these mistakes.  There's a big, a big closer coming.  I thought you already revealed that.  We already worked, you know, we worked toward the closer.  I was fucking watching the TV over there.  I'm sorry.  What are you still using formaldehyde for?  What are you keeping, dead frogs in your cups?  My question is, who's Maldehyde? 
[02:47:30]  Hold it.  Hide him, please.  Of course.  That was actually an old Abin Costello bit.  Was it really?  Take this jar, take it to Mel.  Tell him I need him to hide it.  What's in the jar?  For Mel to hide.  I know it's for Mel to hide, but what's in the...  It actually was.  Are you serious?  No shit.  That was a big follow-up to who's gone first.  They tried it with fucking every word in the dictionary.  And then he found one.  Lou Costello had to run away.  Then he finally found out it was from all the high was four. 
[02:48:00]  And it made him very sad.  Embalming young children that fell in his pool.  Oh my God.  I bet old Lou cemented that pool up pretty quick.  Yeah, he sure did.  Mamre's, let's sell the house.  I bet there's a kid in my skim, skim, skim.  I bet there's a child in my skim, my skim.  I bet turn off the pump, the pump, the pump, the pump. 
[02:48:30]  Oh God.  Classic.  Now, would you rather hear that or the fucking eagle?  See what I'm saying?  Of course.  Fucking God.  Jesus.  Let's get to the bra story.  A little more to it.  Roberta has filed suit against Victoria's Secret and claims she isn't alone.  I was just floored.  I thought, I have to come out with this.  The can of worms has to be open. 
[02:49:00]  Roberta and her attorney claim they've done research of their own.  Sounds awful.  And alleged tests conducted on several Victoria's Secret bras found evidence of the toxic chemical  formaldehyde.  Wow.  She doesn't sound hot.  Preserve those titties.  Her tits must be horrendous.  She does.  She sounds like a...  Great line in there.  Frankie in New York.  That's why we have our listeners helping us out.  Frankie.  Go ahead.  Those are nipples.  Listen to this.  I can't believe this room full of comic geniuses missed that line.  What was the line again?  She said when her tits got all sick and blown up that it made her utterly sick. 
[02:49:30]  Oh, wow.  Utterly.  Yeah, well, we've been up since 5.30.  Okay?  I heard that.  I can't say every word.  Jimmy's farting at the...  Go back to the mattress factory.  That's how success pushes failure out of me.  Yes, of course.  I'm going to be tossing and turning all night.  I can't believe I missed Utterly.  Utterly.  Yeah, sorry.  Utterly.  Utterly.  Utterly.  Wake up in a cold sweat. 
[02:50:00]  We all chose to ignore it, stupid.  It was right there.  Yeah, sorry.  Get your hack fucking line out, dummy.  For its part, Victoria's Secret issued a statement saying,  we have strict quality controls around our products  and we do not use formaldehyde in our bras.  Ritter says her coming forward was an attempt to alert other women.  It's woken me up big time.  And I just hope to wake people up to the reality that it can't happen. 
[02:50:30]  It can't happen.  You know, my tits felt really awful for like a whole day.  I wonder what happened.  I was wondering what happened to Sarah Palin.  And I, yeah, I had a rash.  Formaldehyde.  They don't use formaldehyde.  Why would they use formaldehyde in bras?  I hate reports like that.  So she says formaldehyde, then the company says we don't use formaldehyde.  So what's the fucking truth?  Thanks for the report for not clearing anything up.  That's Victoria's Secret.  I wasn't even confused about it until you brought it up, you fucks.  That's what I hate when reporters say, like, no one knows. 
[02:51:00]  You know, it's like, no, you don't know.  As to whether the allegations are true, no one knows.  No, you don't know.  You didn't find out to tell us.  And it's your fucking job.  Yeah.  You're supposed to know and tell us and then we'll know.  Well, they go, may cause cancer, may not, too.  Fuck it.  Yeah.  Brian, you still do your local news stuff?  Because that's some brilliant crap.  Yeah, the commercials they do for the local news.  A news anchor you can trust.  Yeah.  What is there not to trust? 
[02:51:30]  Is he going to lie to you?  There's a big fire downtown.  I don't know.  Maybe.  I don't know if I trust this guy.  There's something about him.  I can't put my finger on it, but something is awry.  That shit's good.  Or a news team that cares.  Oh, okay.  They don't care on the other channel.  You click over there. 
[02:52:00]  A major highway is closed down today, but hey, I don't drive home that way.  Turn it back to the team that cares.  These two are surly.  I've had it with their uncaring ways.  It's surly.  Surly.  Surly anchors.  I can't even listen when anybody says, consider it done anymore.  I can't even fucking date.  Consider it done. 
[02:52:30]  Wait, what's that?  Is it?  Brian.  I don't remember that bit.  Because it's the dumbest fucking line anyone can say.  Yeah.  Could you do me a favor?  Could you consider it done?  Well, is it?  Is it done?  That's what my age is 70 booked me today for this show.  Consider it done.  Fucking showed up.  Nobody knows.  Holy fuck.  Jimmy.  What's everybody making me feel bad for?  Oh my God.  Are you kidding me?  Yes.  Jimmy.  You're just going off over here. 
[02:53:00]  Can't help it.  We got a good job.  Rapid fire.  Brian's bit was very funny and I got jealous.  Jealousy is another motivating factor.  That was the good part of me, pushing the envy out.  They called the old brown-eyed monster.  Nice.  Jimmy.  You guys want to do another one?  We got a mom posing as a daughter to go back to high school.  And we got a female bartender forced to work in kitchen after gaining five pounds. 
[02:53:30]  Fatty.  Female what?  Fucking pig.  You want to do that one?  Yeah.  Sure.  All right.  She gained a few pounds.  They said, look, you got...  She's a bartender?  Certainly.  They made her go on the kitchen.  Yeah, yeah.  It's like high school girls playing records, but we've got these horrible incidents on audio.  We got our 45s.  Yeah, right.  Play that one.  We're having a little sleepover.  Yeah, that sounds like fun.  Play the leukemia thing.  That was fun.  Yeah, I like that one.  Play that again.  Frankie Valli and then they stare about the cat with no ears. 
[02:54:00]  Laying on the bed on our stomachs with one leg up.  Gossiping about the girls.  That last one was dreamy.  Right.  I never thought of it that way, but you're right.  It's just a stack of 45s.  It's a big slumber party.  Singing about our girlfriend who's in the bathroom looking at the front of her shirt.  What happened?  Oh, shit.  Oh, that's...  Jimmy goes right to unnecessary.  Oh, that's great.  All right.  Female bartender.  These stories pop up from time to time. 
[02:54:30]  Usually in the casinos when, you know, one of the cocktail waitresses gain weight and they  don't want them being the waitress anymore.  I got no problem with that.  I don't have a problem with it either.  Just look at the stewardesses today.  Bunch of fucking heifers.  Go ahead.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  What happened to the, you know...  Well, you couldn't look at a nice piece of ass from New York to L.A.  They might make the time go by.  You ever...  You'll have to look at a gay man...  I'm going to steal John Madden in a fucking dress.  Yeah.  Here's my peanuts.  I fucking ate them.  All right.  Thank you.  Yeah.  We got an airline commercial that actually ran where they play up the whole sex angle big time.  They used to.  Can we get that in Iraq? 
[02:55:00]  The whole Fly Me campaign years ago.  Well, then the feminists got involved and bullied...  Hi, I'm Jessica.  Fly me.  Yeah.  And she'd be all hot and everything.  Now it's, hi, I'm Jessica.  She meant the airline.  She meant the airline.  Oh.  Because she was representing the airline.  I thought she meant fly her.  No.  No.  No.  So you read into that.  Yeah, I fucked up.  You read into that.  We'll find it.  You've got to hear the spot.  That ad is, hi, I'm Jessica.  Feed me now.  Feed me.  Come on and feed me.  They look like Playboy models and they...  They used to.  Fly the Friendly Skies of United. 
[02:55:30]  Sean and George have something for...  Donovan.  Sean's got something for Brian Regan.  I wanted to ask Brian's opinion or something.  Uh, Brian, did you ever watch shows when you were younger about maybe Flipper or Gentle  Ben or anything like that?  I'm wondering how you like those.  Yeah.  I thought we stopped doing this bit.  I thought we stopped doing this bit.  If you're going to do this bit, could you make it a little shorter?  Four of the most gifted comedians sitting around me and I'm going to like, you know.  But, um... 
[02:56:00]  Yeah, but let me tell you.  No, I appreciate the setup.  Brian, I was thinking about you yesterday because when the truckers call, we always ask,  what are you hauling?  And the guy goes, I'm hauling spaghetti sauce to Chicago.  And I think of the bit, the lumber bit you talk about where the lumber...  Log trucks.  The log trucks pass each other on the highway like, what are they doing?  Yeah, you got one truck over here going that way.  You got one truck over there going that way.  I just, I don't get the point.  Logging trucks should never have to pass each other. 
[02:56:30]  Exactly, ever.  There's no...  Somebody could make a phone call and that should be eliminated.  Logging trucks should never pass.  That's a good fucking point.  Yeah, it is.  But don't they have spaghetti sauce in Chicago?  Like, why do you need a truck spaghetti sauce into Chicago?  And I bet there are trucks leaving Chicago full of spaghetti sauce.  They're going the other way.  They're leaving the other way.  Yeah.  There's got to be some central command that can save a lot of miles.  Yeah, that they're making spaghetti sauce somewhere in Chicago. 
[02:57:00]  They have to be.  Just make a little...  And I'm on my gosh!  I love that bit.  Yeah, but you're forgetting that it's different brands and stuff.  Oh, literal Jim.  Hey, did the wise guys make the cut?  The satellite radio cut?  Of course.  Of course they had to.  Hey, you're not going to whack that, Joe?  Hey!  Hey!  Hey, I said rest in peace to the meal I just killed.  Hey!  Who's got the fucking...  Hey!  Rest in peace.  All right, hold on. 
[02:57:30]  We've got another question for Brian coming in.  Ted in South Dakota.  Ted?  Brian?  Yes?  I know you're an expert in all things medicine.  I've got a sports-related injury, and I'm not exactly sure what I should tell my coach  that I have.  Can you help me out?  Oh, yeah.  I don't know if you're referring to the fantasy football.  People play fantasy football, and you've got to check for the injury reports.  Yeah.  And it kills me.  You check the injury report in the newspaper.  It has the guy's name, and then they put a body part.  Can you imagine if your doctor gave you a diagnosis like that? 
[02:58:00]  You know, you're sitting on the table.  He comes in, uh, I'm going to tell you straight.  I had other doctors weigh in on this.  We got the results back from the blood test, and also the EKG analysis is consistent with  what we had thought.  I wanted an anesthesiologist to come in and take a look at what I had speculated, and also  the urine analysis came back.  Everything seems to be consistent.  You have what we in the medical community refer to as knee. 
[02:58:30]  That's what it says in the paper.  The guy's hurt.  What's the matter?  Knee.  I got knee.  I got knee.  Aren't there like about a million things in a knee?  What, did he skin it?  He could skin it, or it could be gone.  Yeah, you could hit it with a sledgehammer, it could have a pinprick.  Did he fall or piss off the IRA?  It could be a pimple on it, or it could be under a truck. 
[02:59:00]  He's got a knee.  We found one in the airline ads.  Oh, goody.  This is how they used to sell flying.  Yeah.  70s, I think it is.  Yes, of course.  Early, mid-70s, we're thinking.  I'm Maggie.  Fly me to New York.  You'll love my two 747s to Kennedy.  Fly me.  Fly Maggie.  Fly Maggie.  Fly Maggie.  You'll love my two 747s.  Yeah.  Why do they have to say two?  That's a tit joke.  That's right.  Of course, you've got two giant, luscious 747s. 
[02:59:30]  You hope it doesn't wind up, enjoy my one 747 and my Embraer.  Oh, God.  My Piper Cub.  All right, we've got the bartender story all over the place.  Another 45 we want to play for everybody as we do our little slumber party.  Groovy.  Is this the B-side?  Yeah.  Is this the B-side of Charlie Pride?  Yeah.  A battle of the bulge at a local nightclub.  A female bartender says that her boss forced her to work in the kitchen after she gained five pounds. 
[03:00:00]  Now she's suing.  Victoria S. Sortso says she was an exemplary employee for nearly a year here at West Hollywood Hotspot Foxtail.  Now she's filed a lawsuit alleging sexual discrimination, saying her employees moved her from the bar back to the kitchen and told her to lose some weight.  It has humiliated me to be told that my value as a human being is based solely on my weight. 
[03:00:30]  All right.  You know what?  Can I jump in real fast?  Sure.  It is a fact.  If you hire a hot chick to be behind the bar, you make more money.  Yeah, but here's my point.  You make more money.  I'm sorry, but this is West Hollywood.  You know, it's all fucking fags.  It doesn't matter what she looks like.  True.  Okay.  Thank you.  Yep.  Virginia S. Sortso says she's always been a size 5'6 since she started work as a bartender at Foxtail in January.  It's her height.  This is my uniform I was given on my first day of work. 
[03:01:00]  What a shallow cunt.  But Sortso says even though her clothing size didn't change, earlier this month the manager told her she'd gained weight and that she'd have to work in the kitchen out of public view until she lost 5 to 6 pounds to start.  They told me that my appearance had changed, that it wasn't my hair or makeup, that I was bigger.  They asked me how long it would take for me to lose it.  And when I said I didn't know, I'm a part-time student in the mornings, they said, well, we're going to have to put you in back. 
[03:01:30]  We're going to have to tuck you away, you pig.  What are you, 180?  Put on an apron.  It would be worse if they told her to lose height.  Yeah, exactly.  What do they have to do with it?  And why send her to the kitchen?  That's the worst.  I know.  She's got her face in the chicken fingers.  Sortso says is now on leave from Foxtail, owned by L.A.-based SBE Entertainment, which owns upscale restaurants, bars, and hotels in L.A., Las Vegas, and Miami. 
[03:02:00]  Sortso says further alleges in the complaint that Foxtail was a sexually hostile work environment where women sometimes walked around in lingerie,  and on one occasion, VIPs were given a menu of sex toys for sale.  Sortso says his attorney maintains her client was being held to an unfair gender stereotype.  Fuck off.  No woman should have to fit a gender stereotype of what a woman should look like. 
[03:02:30]  Is that Gloria Ulrich?  That is a form of sex discrimination, we argue.  Sounds like that.  And that is prohibited by law.  Especially where, as is here, the men bartenders are not required to lose weight.  Yeah, because nobody gives a fuck, you dumb cunt.  You're fucking, you're everything that's wrong with this world, you stupid cunt.  Jesus fucking Christ.  Right?  Un-fucking-believable. 
[03:03:00]  Fuck.  It just astounds me.  All right, look, five pounds, that ain't that much.  I don't know, maybe she was on the brink.  You ever see girls that are on the brink?  They're on the high end.  If you own a business, you should be able to do whatever the fuck you are.  You're goddamn right, Ulrich.  Within the law.  Goddamn right.  You should have told her there's a different reason.  Get in the kitchen because I want someone else out there.  She's an employee, she has to do what he says anyway.  It's your business.  No, but he's stupid not knowing what the ramifications would be.  But do you see how this yelling?  Oh, Jimmy.  Oh, no, did that get you nervous? 
[03:03:30]  Yes.  That put a lot of hurt in me.  Like it's a tragedy.  Some chick had her feelings hurt.  You see how we protect the self-esteem of fucking women?  It's the most precious thing on the face.  It certainly is.  Jimmy, what the fuck?  Jimmy, what happened, Jimmy?  It's like I got a piece of shit on my upper lip over here.  What happened, Jimmy?  Nothing.  Listen.  You don't say too much, Jimmy.  What's the matter?  I feel fat.  That was the skinny push on the phone.  I'm going to start a story.  Campari, you don't fart much.  Yeah, it's a nice story. 
[03:04:00]  It translates a little better.  He said, stop farting.  And then he said something else and something else.  And my son was shot in the back of the head in an empty room.  Tracy Morgan's on NBC right now.  He's always on NBC.  Oh, look, Oprah.  Good.  Oprah did 30 Rock, yeah.  That's fun.  I guess there was something I had for Nick, but I can't remember now.  Tracy Morgan's funny as hell.  There was something.  He's funny.  There was something where you were going to do...  A chill pill?  I was just kidding about that shit. 
[03:04:30]  I was trying to make Jimmy fart.  It worked, of course.  See how we run it to anger.  Yeah.  I feel like there's a little...  We should try different emotions, you know?  How about angst?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Happiness?  Tracy's head is shiny.  Jesus.  I know.  Get girl pregnant.  Wow, yeah.  Look at his hair.  It's really shiny.  Putting weight on again.  It's fake.  It's fake.  Yeah.  For Issa Fundy. 
[03:05:00]  That's not him.  That's not him either.  That's that guy from CNN.  Yeah.  Oh, that's...  Christopher Dodd.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  Guy gets his sweetheart deal from country.  Yeah.  That's great.  Let's play the next 45.  Had a white hair on that guy.  I like Brian's analogy here.  I'm going to use that after you're gone, Brian.  Mom poses as daughter to go back to high school.  There's something that was going to...  Yeah.  Poses as her own dog?  I think so, yeah.  What?  That's crazy. 
[03:05:30]  How does a 33-year-old mom pass herself off as a high school cheerleader?  What?  Primary school response, Michelle Carey.  You're going to tell us, right?  By wearing pants?  Apparently somewhat convincingly, Mike.  Hold on.  We got an answer to the logging question that Brian brings up in his act.  This might ruin the bit.  I know.  I don't want to get a logical response.  Let's go to Kevin.  I'm pointing out the ridiculousness of it.  Yeah.  Kevin.  What's up, guys?  Hey, man.  We got Brian Regan in the studio.  Hi.  Thank you, man.  Hey, Jim.  We do this all the time. 
[03:06:00]  We haul product to one warehouse, take it off our truck, put it on another trailer.  That way they don't have to pay inventory tax on it.  It's constant.  I am.  Wait.  You guys are just moving the lumber around for the hell of it?  Yeah.  We just take it from one place and they take it off our truck, put it on another truck.  Oh, please tell me he's kidding me.  Please fucking tell me you're kidding me.  Please tell me that's not the fucking world I live in.  Please fucking tell me that.  You're kidding me, right?  Your whole day is just moving the lumber around.  They should change this inventory tax rule. 
[03:06:30]  Yeah.  Oh, my effing word.  Wow, man.  Get those trees out of here.  We're going to get taxed on them.  Love the show, guys.  I'm a bunch out.  All right.  Okay.  Get that lumber back to Bangor before you get taxed on it.  Pick up those two-by-fours and get them to fucking...  Get them over and back over to Sacramento.  It's like juggling.  Fucking keep them in the air.  Keep one in the air, man, or else they're going to charge you. 
[03:07:00]  Inventory tax.  Who comes up with this shit?  I don't even know what that means.  Unbelievable.  Jesus Christ, huh?  How does a 33-year-old mom pass herself off as a high school cheerleader?  By blowing the captain?  By blowing the captain?  You're going to tell us, right?  Apparently, somewhat convincingly, Mike, police say this woman attended cheerleading practice,  got at cheerleaders' locker at school, and went to a pool party at the cheerleading coach's house.  Take a look at 33-year-old Wendy Brown.  Does she look 15 to you, huh?  No. 
[03:07:30]  Not at all.  Not at all.  Police say Brown stole.  She's good, huh?  The girl's doing the story.  He's enrolled at a school in Green Bay, Wisconsin.  Problem is, she only went the first day of class.  A truant officer started investigating and found out that her daughter actually lives in Nevada with her grandmother.  Who gives a turkey?  The male cheerleader noticed her pussy was bone dry when he lifted it.  He lifted her.  I just like the way the news guy reacted. 
[03:08:00]  It's hard for me to think of a tag for that.  Nice, wholesome, clean tag.  To that joke, Nick.  Did you hear the news guy?  I can't really jump on your punchline.  Yeah.  You're out of that one time.  Brian, go.  Make it wholesome, please.  Interesting you said that, Nick.  No.  I'm sorry.  Let's put it through the Brian Regan wholesome filter.  Golly jeepers.  It's a beauty of satellite, isn't it?  It certainly is.  What were you going to say yet?  The woman was like, does that woman look 15 to you? 
[03:08:30]  And one guy, and they went, no.  Like he knew a little too much what a 15-year-old looks like.  The guy fucking her.  And knew that weren't it.  She's too developed for a 15-year-old.  No.  No.  Speaking of pussy, Brian, have you ever seen a horse's pussy?  Uh, yeah, last night I nailed a horse.  You nailed it?  You want to look at horse pussy today?  Sure.  I do. 
[03:09:00]  Is it Rosie?  I get the feeling we're going in that direction anyway.  Have you ever seen a horse's pussy?  I've seen a horse's pussy.  Check it out.  It was at Rosie O'Donnell's pool party.  Here's the second half of the cheerleader story as Danny finds horse pussy.  Wait, wait, wait.  Jesus Christ, it's a two-potter?  Oh, yeah, it is.  Apparently, this woman had an issue with some childhood she thinks she missed, and this is  her idea of getting her childhood back.  Faculty members thought she did look a little bit old.  I guess they thought she'd had a rough life, but she acted like a teenager.  Apparently, she cried in class because she wasn't good at math. 
[03:09:30]  What?  I don't think teenagers cry about that.  She played this to the hilt.  She did 33 minus 15 equals 18.  That's her age.  Did you hear what the other guy said?  She played it to the hilt.  To the hilt.  Listen, when was the last time you heard the word hilt?  Probably Tuesday.  What?  I don't think teenagers cry about that.  She played this to the hilt then.  I think teenagers don't care if they're not good at math, so I'm not really sure about  the whole crying thing.  Right.  What?  My joke bummed. 
[03:10:00]  So that's it.  She's just making up for lost time.  I think it's a little deeper than that, actually, but that's her story that supposedly  is telling.  And then she had to write a check for some cheerleading activities, and then she bounced the check,  and that kind of also led to her whole story sort of falling apart.  Wow.  This is crazy, Mike.  It is.  Jimmy.  Brian, if I was you, I would sneak out.  Yeah.  Jimmy's just blasting farts off now into the microphone.  You're like a light wader.  Yeah.  My joke bombed, and that was me pushing bad jokes out. 
[03:10:30]  Brian, sneak out.  It's going to start getting off the radio.  Is this the news?  There's Muppets on.  Why are there Muppets on the news?  They look like Susan Waldman.  They've been doing the Muppet thing all day.  Maybe it's some kind of anniversary.  Tie-in with Jim Henson.  A monotonous-ness.  It's been five years since the whole country where he liked what in his what?  When he died and people thought it was of something else.  People are very excited that Brian Regan is into bestiality like we are. 
[03:11:00]  So why don't we show Brian the horse pussy?  There's a horse pussy.  Is that fucking nice?  That ain't right.  That looks like a fat pussy on top and an asshole on the bottom.  It looks like just the opposite.  Brian, would you?  I'd ride that horse.  We'd like to play would you.  That's all.  Would you?  Are you sure that's not good?  I'm going to say, I'm going to decline.  This gets back to the two lines.  I'll be in the line.  No, thank you.  I'm more grossed out by the awful wrinkled hands holding it open. 
[03:11:30]  Yeah.  Those are terrible hands.  I bet their fingers smell real nice too after that.  You got the grapevine olive commercial.  That's like what a bad hand model gets.  He gets that gig.  A good hand model gets the Noxzema.  The bad hand model gets this gig.  It's the hold open a horse pussy.  We got that picture from Oprah's, O-G-B-Y-N.  Oh, shit.  Listen to me.  There's something else going on with the hands.  That's a man's hand.  Yeah.  That's a female's hand.  It's two different hands. 
[03:12:00]  Oh, wow.  They're working together to open up the horse pussy.  That's great.  Wow.  The line team.  It's weird.  Someone needs a free hand.  Open up the horse pussy this weekend.  Closing time.  Come on in.  Nickel bears.  The horse pussy.  Just stick your tongue in there.  Jeez, oh man.  Stick your tongue in there.  Want to taste oats?  Let's say hi.  It looks awful human.  Yeah.  That's what we're getting at then.  No, I understand it.  That's why we play the would you game. 
[03:12:30]  Like in a pinch?  Right.  Would you?  In a pinch?  It's been years.  Is that actually a horse?  You're horribly disfigured and you can't fucking fuck.  It looks like the exit wound on Martin Luther King's back.  Yeah, it does really look awful.  Yeah.  The problem is the asshole is right on top of it.  Like, dressed.  I mean, you're going to get shit on if you're having sex with this.  Looks like a speed bag.  Hello.  Anybody?  Kind of saved me a little bit.  There you go. 
[03:13:00]  Cross critter, the trucker.  Hello.  What's up?  I'm Brian.  Little Jimmy.  Hi.  Basically, what the other driver was talking about is totally the truth.  Half of our business, I mean, I do flatbed, half of our business is nothing but picking  stuff up, moving it from one place.  I've picked it up, dropped the trailer, had another driver pick it up, take it right  back to the same place that we picked it up at.  So, the point is that if it's in a warehouse somewhere, then they're paying taxes.  But if it's out on the road, they're not paying taxes. 
[03:13:30]  Is that what's going on?  Well, basically, even if it goes to another warehouse, it's not necessarily their warehouse,  so they have to pay for it being stored.  Oh, wow.  It's, you know, to pay 50 cents a mile, you know, or, you know, a dollar a mile or whatever  to get it hauled around is a hell of a lot cheaper than having a storage.  It is?  Really?  Wow.  So, if everyone's in on this, why not they just go, all right, we won't tax anymore?  Because we know what you're doing to get around this.  Yeah, sir.  If it's actually kind of productive, why are they doing it?  Go. 
[03:14:00]  You.  Go.  You're on.  What say you?  All right.  Thank you, sir.  What say you?  What say you?  I'm fucking real.  Wait.  Who says what say you?  There's a few newscasters.  No, who?  Is it?  I think that's O'Reilly, right?  What says you?  Bill O'Reilly says that.  I think somebody else says that, too.  Jessica.  Kevin Bacon.  Jessica in New Jersey.  You're a handsome man, Mr. Garrison.  Oh, the fact they want to suck Jim Garrison's dick.  Oh, yeah.  Jessica, you there?  Yeah, hi.  Jess, you're on the Echo.  Hey, Brian, I really want you to do me a favor. 
[03:14:30]  Uh-oh.  I'm not going to do a bit.  You've got to do the chess bit.  He doesn't have to do nothing, lady.  I don't know.  Performing seal for you.  The check bit.  Chess.  Chess.  Oh, chess.  Chess.  Chess.  Well, thank you for wanting to.  It's kind of a long thing.  Yeah.  And I appreciate the.  Take off your top.  No, no, no.  That's very cool.  Thank you.  You do the chess bit.  We'll all take leaks.  By the time we're back, you're done with the chess bit. 
[03:15:00]  So we'll get back to what we were talking about before.  You guys are all at home in your studio.  And we'll show you more animal pussies.  Brian, do the horse clit bit.  Is your chess bit something about, yeah, I was playing chess, and all the black pawns  jumped on the white queen?  Go figure.  No, that ain't.  That ain't mine.  That's not mine.  It's Tracy Morgan.  That ain't my chess bit.  That ain't my chess bit.  That's somebody else's.  I don't think we're going to hear the chess bit, Jessica. 
[03:15:30]  I'm sorry.  All right.  Were you agree loudly with Bobby Fisher?  No, my chess bit is.  Here we go.  He's such a nice guy.  I just, I don't get the game, man.  Jimmy plays chess.  You play chess?  Well.  Maybe he can help you.  Well, here's what I don't.  I have somebody trying to show me how to play chess.  And he move a piece and put his finger on the top and just stare at it.  And I'm like, what's going on?  He goes, it's not an official move until I take my finger off the piece. 
[03:16:00]  I'm thinking.  And I'm like, well, you can just tell me you're thinking and I'll trust you.  He's like, no, no, no.  You got to do it like this.  And I'm like, I bet your desk is very organized.  And then he moves it back.  I don't want to do that.  And he move another piece, put his finger on the top of that, stare at that for another  few minutes.  And then he finally takes his finger off.  Can you imagine if you could do that in life?  If you're going to do something, you're not quite sure it's the right move.  You just protect yourself. 
[03:16:30]  You walk into a bank with a gun and a finger on the top of your head.  I want everybody's money.  Then you look around.  I'm not going to do this.  I'm not going to do this.  Do you put your finger on the top?  You do the top thing?  I move so fast, there's no time.  Checkmate!  Yeah, you hold your finger on just because you don't want the other guy bitching at you. 
[03:17:00]  And you don't want to feel like you saw a better move after you took your hand.  So you're telling me a guy with no arms can't play check.  That's right.  You can keep your nose on it.  You can put his nose on it.  I'm thinking.  That's why my nose is buried in this rook.  Let's go to Sam in Ohio.  Sam?  What's going on?  Welcome aboard, Sammy.  Sammy, what up?  Dude, I work for General Motors, and you guys are talking about the taxes and stuff?  Mm-hmm.  They've told us before to shut down the presses and just sit down and wait because it's cheaper 
[03:17:30]  to pay us $30 an hour than pay taxes on those parts.  Yeah, that's why you guys are going out of business in three minutes.  Yeah, I know.  With an attitude like that.  I think we're finding something out that I don't think average people know about.  Yeah, you wonder why the chinks are kicking ass.  We're all driving product all over the country.  Yeah.  Let's go to Chicago.  Biggs.  I'm bringing some butternut squash to Denver.  What's up, Biggs?  I feel bad for all these bit requests for Regan.  Hey, DePaulo, why don't you do that bit about the whores?  Go.  Did he say horse or whores? 
[03:18:00]  Whores.  Either way, I know it's going to be good.  You got a good whore bit there, Nick?  No, I don't.  Oh, you don't?  All right.  I really don't.  Thanks for the request.  I was hoping he was requesting a real bit so we could get to 11 o'clock.  I couldn't even remember it.  Fuck off my bits.  I don't work like that anymore.  How about we take a quick break?  We'll regroup.  I do other people's bits.  I got to take a leak.  We got to take a leak.  Brian, if you need to go, I understand.  I think I'm going to try to zonk out for a couple hours.  Oh, quit being a pussy, Brian.  I'm the one that's got to go do the fucking book signing at 6 o'clock in Rhode Island tonight. 
[03:18:30]  At Borders.  Oh, nice.  Yeah, that'll take a lot of energy, huh?  I don't like that.  Sit in a chair.  Sign my book.  Sign my book.  Oh, no.  I fucking go crazy at book signings.  It's a fucking madhouse.  I am.  And you're on the bestsellers list there, Jimmy.  Well, you know, I don't know.  You're on the bestseller list.  Yeah, you made the list, man.  That's very cool.  That's amazing, Jimmy.  Good for you.  Thank you, man.  Good for you.  Good for you, Spider.  Thank you.  Best-selling author, man.  I've got a brochure.  And it wasn't easy this time around because there's like 10 Obama books on the list. 
[03:19:00]  That's why I said O'Reilly.  His book's on the list.  It's a fucking...  It's a good book.  How many Obama books for real?  Like four?  Four Obama books.  Four?  A Lennon book.  It's just stuff that's really hard to compare with.  Four Obama books.  Where is it on the...  Four books at one time?  The printed list is 15 spaces.  The first black president?  You're number 13.  Yeah.  Damn.  Yeah.  The power of the show, Brian.  With a bullet.  Write a book.  And a book.  I'll be on and off in one week, but I'll be happy I was there.  No, you won't.  No, no.  I'm not even being down to play it. 
[03:19:30]  It's just probably a reality.  That's fantastic.  Unless the fans love me.  Look at how hot Sarah Palin looks with her messy hair today.  I know.  She should have done that.  She is a little sluttered up.  She is adorable.  She's got bed head today on Fox News.  That would have been ridiculous.  Look at that.  Look at that.  I'm a cousin in.  That would have been really fun.  That would have been pretty cool.  They have her in front of a map to show that she knows about geography.  Yeah, where's Africa?  Point.  Quick.  Go.  Go.  They're saying that that never happened.  I know it didn't.  I don't think that could have happened.  Of course not.  Some feminist with a mustache hated her guts. 
[03:20:00]  You can't know Africa as a...  Brian...  A continent?  What is it?  A country?  No, it's a fucking county.  It's a state.  It's a county in Jersey.  Newark.  Yeah, Newark.  Africa County.  Brian, who do you hate?  By race.  Stu Kamens.  By race.  I know.  Yeah.  That won't get me in too much.  Brian, you're not allowed to leave until you tell us who you hate.  Who do you hate?  By God's Day Worship.  Go. 
[03:20:30]  Go.  I'll tell you who I hate.  Uh-oh.  Here we go.  That was horrible.  This is from the bottom.  I hate people from Liechtenstein.  Ah.  Watch one person from Liechtenstein.  We'll write a letter.  I know.  It's less than one.  Yes.  One guy who doesn't get that there's humor involved.  How dare you?  Is that how I talk?  Yeah, that's how Liechtenstein...  That's a Liechtenstein accent.  Yeah.  How dare you make fun of Liechtenstein? 
[03:21:00]  You gotta go.  Sign Larry Orpheum, and he cancels you Friday.  Larry Orpheum.  Larry Orpheum.  Yeah, I get the one theater owner from Liechtenstein who cancels my whole weekend.  Lawrence Orpheum.  I didn't see the humor in it.  All right, we gotta let Ryan go.  He needs to sleep.  Ryan, thank you all, man.  I had fun.  I just want people to miss me. 
[03:21:30]  I want some attention.  I love the range, man.  The truckers to...  Picture of the horse.  The horse pussy?  You can say horse pussy.  They'll still come to your show.  Picture of the horse.  No, Brian, say it before you leave.  No, Brian's got an image.  Don't do that.  It's not gonna hurt you, though.  Horse what?  Horse.  It's a horse image.  Horse what?  It's a horse.  I'll tell you what, it's a horse visual.  That's what that is.  It's a picture of a what?  It's a horse photograph.  Of what, though?  Look at that thing. 
[03:22:00]  What is it?  Let me ask you, honestly.  It looks like a bullet wound in Shannon Sharp's ass.  What pisses me off is we haven't been able to crack this guy, what, you've been doing  our show ten years now.  Twice selling out this weekend.  Right, exactly.  Just say it.  Say it.  That horse.  I gave it two minutes after I met you.  Let me ask you a question.  You can ask this however you want.  Would you rather lick that or fuck it?  Well, that's easy.  Yeah, exactly.  Want the horse to come first, aren't you?  Are there more options on the menu? 
[03:22:30]  No, those are the two.  You've got to answer it, Brian.  It's like steak or chicken.  You have to pick one.  Or we lock in here.  Where is the clitoris?  Show them the raccoon catch.  Does the horse have a clitoris?  Well, Brian, why don't you point out the clitoris on the horse pussy for everybody?  No, there's two hands there pointing.  There's two hands pointing.  It's at four o'clock.  There's plenty of fingers pointing at everything.  Everything's being pointed at in that picture.  They actually have two.  There's ten fingers.  With a window wash, you just peeked in at the horse pussy.  It really did look.  That's when they stop squeegeeing. 
[03:23:00]  Yeah, he's looking at the horse.  He doesn't know that's a horse pussy.  Of course he doesn't.  He's laughing at it as he plummets to his death.  Wouldn't that be great?  A horse has two clits.  One at ten and two o'clock.  Oh, look.  Oh, is that it?  He's calling the other guy over.  Take a look.  They both go over to the other side and set it off balance and fall.  When they're sitting down to have their break, to drink their soup out of their thermos, 
[03:23:30]  this is what they've got to look in at.  Who is pussy?  That reminds me.  I've got a roast beef sandwich.  I forgot I had lunch.  Fucking meat-filled cannoli.  That reminds me.  I've got a pastrami on poppinickel.  Oh, my goodness.  Oh, jeez.  That is a horrible-looking fucking thing.  What do you mean?  It's making me hungry.  Yeah. 
[03:24:00]  Maybe you could do it in...  It's a strami on poppinickel.  That's what it looks like.  All right, look.  We're...  They're gone.  Where did they go?  We're going to get a reaction.  The rope snapped.  We'll get a reaction from them, all right.  It's that guy over there.  He'll never hear this.  Yeah, I know, but I don't know how we're going to do this.  Who's Sarah Palin talking to?  I don't know.  Nobody.  I think she's just trying to get things going for...  What was that?  2000 fucking what? 
[03:24:30]  12?  12?  Jeez, shut up.  2012.  Doesn't have a prayer.  No?  Fuck no.  It's in public eye.  Hell fucking no.  Yeah, what do I know?  You're right.  Hell fucking no.  All right, Brian Regan, thank you.  BrianRegan.com.  Thank you, guys.  He's all over the house.  He's close in the next three or four days.  So go to BrianRegan.com for all the dates, right?  Yep.  That's easy.  Perfect.  Thank you.  NickDip.com.  Yep.  November 28th, Tarrytown Music Theater.  That's what it was.  Night of the Thanksgiving.  It's going to be great. 
[03:25:00]  There'll be a live band at some other place.  And we're going to continue with Nick and Jimmy, so don't go anywhere.  We've got at least another 15, 20 minutes in us.  We just got some good news.  I guess we can announce it officially.  We're doing the homeless shopping spree this year. 
[03:25:30]  Yes.  After taking, was it last year or the last two years off?  Just one year off.  We had some stupid PD, I forgot her name at this point, who didn't understand how the  homeless shopping spree would be a good thing for everybody.  Oh, God.  I remember that.  She wouldn't give up a fucking day part.  Right.  I'm not giving up my day part.  She would not let us have afternoons for one day.  And that's when we stopped listening to her like, wow, what a surprise, another PD that  doesn't get it in this business. 
[03:26:00]  But then again, she could have been overwritten.  We're like, we're done with you.  No, it was all her decision.  Tom could have overrode her and he didn't.  Yeah.  Tom agreed with her.  He could have and he fucking didn't.  She was a ton of...  But we're bringing back the homeless shopping spree.  We're going to have details soon.  Great idea that she had.  It looks like it's going to be December 12th, so mark your calendar.  We want a lot of fans to help the homeless shop this year.  Yes.  But we just got the news literally like two minutes ago while you guys were listening  to the horse shit promos that just play over and over and over and over again.  What the fuck are you doing?  And what's wrong, Nick? 
[03:26:30]  Huh?  What happened?  Nick farted.  I got nervous and I shit my pants.  That's what he does.  Did he really fart?  Right to it.  Oh my...  Was that mine or yours, Jimmy?  Not mine.  Holy shit.  I never understood that.  Like, you're not really affected by the smell of your own farts.  But if you and someone else fart at the same time...  Yeah.  And your fart doesn't stink and you think the other guy's fart is yours, will you be  offended by it and go like, eww?  Or will you go, oh, it's just one of mine?  Yeah.  Interesting.  That's very interesting. 
[03:27:00]  That one could have killed 10,000 Kurds.  Oh my God, that was fucking horrendous.  He used it on his own people.  I did.  I used it on myself.  Tracy was jealous.  Your hair was better than hers.  Oh.  Oh.  Well, remember, she could have used some conditioner.  Oh.  Why?  Oh, her hair.  Oh, conditioner, Joe.  What?  Did she have dry hair?  Oh.  No.  Not if she was the scarecrow in The Wizard of Oz. 
[03:27:30]  But no one...  A little fire, Tracy?  No, it wasn't approved, which is frustrating because the merger's now done.  So we're going to do homeless shopping spree December 12th.  A fucking eggnog drinking challenge.  Over.  Done.  Done.  Can't do it anymore.  One person.  What the fuck?  What the fuck?  Drowned or whatever the fuck?  That bitch that held in her piss until she died.  But this whole contest...  Pretty much it.  Isn't that what it said?  In a nutshell.  That's on her tombstone.  Yeah.  Bitch who held in her piss until she died. 
[03:28:00]  Silly bitch.  And loving mother.  But how many people knew that you could die from drinking too much water?  I know.  Four or five hundred thousand tops.  Who fucking knew?  I didn't know that.  Did you really know that before that, Jimmy?  I did not know.  Okay, good.  I did not know.  I did not know.  I didn't even know it after.  That's not even waterboarding.  No.  No.  Waterboarding.  How cool is that?  You should have made a piddle.  Still fighting for the eggnog drinking challenge, but I don't think we're going to win that  one.  But homeless shopping spree, good news.  December 12th.  It's a go.  So, we got Ghost Hunters in Philly, Jimmy. 
[03:28:30]  Oh, no.  I can't say ghosts like you, but.  Ghost.  Hey, he says it's easy.  Don't hang me out to dry.  Wow.  Say it once.  Ghosts!  Ted?  Hi, Ted.  You're actually the wrong guy.  Ghost Hunter.  That's why.  Oil's cheap now, huh?  Yeah.  You know, $57, 57.50? 
[03:29:00]  If that doesn't show this whole thing's bullshit.  Lock in your fucking heating prices.  Lock them in.  If this doesn't show that the whole thing is bullshit.  What was it three months ago?  A hundred and what?  Fucking 140, 150.  Fucking bullshit.  Oh, but that's supply and demand, man.  It just proves that it's legit.  Free market.  It went down.  Bullshit.  People stopped driving.  Our economy sucks, so they don't do anything.  We're not buying stuff, so we're not going to the stores.  And now the price points.  Oh, is that it?  So now OPEC will fucking start pumping out little spurts of oil and fuck us. 
[03:29:30]  People really stopped driving, really?  No, they didn't.  I was on the road every day, and there was just as much trash stop driving.  I don't know anybody who did.  Isn't that all?  No.  Bullshit.  That's speculation.  That feeds the speculation shit like that.  Yes.  Is that how it works?  I think so.  Yeah.  It fed the speculation.  This shitty economy we're having started after the gas prices really went high.  And then the oil prices, they had to get lower because our economy was shit.  Right.  So people were like, oh, we're not going to fucking, we're not going to go out and drive  anymore.  So the price came down.  I remember hearing the news going, my social life, I don't have it anymore because gas prices 
[03:30:00]  are so high.  Really?  Wow.  Your social life, you can't afford to go out because of fucking your gas.  You never had a social life.  What were you doing?  Every gas station I went to, there were other people pumping gas, there's people driving,  there's people fucking shopping.  Yeah.  I was secretly hoping for high gas prices so I could drive out to Long Island without  any traffic.  I'm not even joking.  I'm like, make it high.  I don't know how you guys make that ride.  So I can go see my fucking family. 
[03:30:30]  It's the worst road in America.  These hours are still low.  I know the one in Boston.  What was the one in Boston that was really bad from-  The whole fucking thing.  Which one?  No, the one near the water.  It was, oh fuck, help me out.  What, the Expressway 93?  It's a corridor over there that they said was the worst in the-  Oh, Starro Drive?  No, no.  The main highway that goes north-south.  143.  Well, that's the expressway, 93.  Yeah, yeah.  I think it's 93.  There's a part of 93 that they officially said is the worst highway in America.  No, LIE. 
[03:31:00]  LIE is the worst.  It is so ridiculous.  Rush Hour, Friday, LIE.  Try it.  But it's raining.  Oh!  And a vagina truck has dropped pussies all over the shoulder.  Oh boy, then we've got real problems.  It gets slick.  You slip on a lip.  But Anthony, it sips sinks.  But during Rush Hour, you expect that it's going to be horrendous.  I'm talking about Saturday at noon.  Why is it the bumper bumper?  I know.  I've sat in traffic at 2 in the morning on that road.  Thank you.  Where you're like, what the fuck is going on?  It's 2 in the morning.  I did a gig a couple weekends ago down in Belmore, I think. 
[03:31:30]  Yeah.  Brokerage or whatever.  Brokerage, sure.  I get on this Southern State Park to go home.  I go about two miles, and all of a sudden they're doing construction.  Detour us through Roosevelt or some shit.  Oh, great.  But they couldn't put a sign up saying, they let you get on the highway and go two miles  before they let you know this construction.  Before they let you know.  So now I'm going through Roosevelt with a thousand other cars.  Great.  At lights, stop signs, fucking shootings.  After having a miserable night.  Roosevelt isn't the nicest neighborhood to go through at that hour. 
[03:32:00]  It actually made it interesting.  I didn't mind.  But oh my God.  Fucking.  I'm like, I could have been a dentist.  It stuns me when I drive home, and I'm just like, what the fuck is this?  It makes you weep.  The rain is one thing, too.  The cars multiply when it rains.  They multiply, and people lose their minds.  They think that their tires cannot even handle water at all.  It's water.  It's not olive oil.  Step on the fucking gas.  Dumb fucks.  Olive oil roads in Guinea. 
[03:32:30]  Chom.  Chom.  Mother Nature, not Mama Leone.  Douche.  Genco olive oil.  Genco olive oil.  Have your blessing.  Now go kill everybody.  Godfather, can you bless me?  Yeah.  Who wants to bless the olive oil company you're making?  Stupid olive oil.  Who cares?  Like shooting people.  They cut the competitor's throat.  Opey like a real Irishman.  Stupid olive oil.  Fuck it.  I never got it. 
[03:33:00]  It's good for your heart, man.  I never understood the olive oil thing.  Oh, it's terrific.  You never go to a restaurant where you have a big clove of garlic.  I tried it.  And they fucking bake the shit out of him.  He grew up on shepherd's pie.  He doesn't know what to fuck.  Yeah, I don't know.  It's all about the vinegar.  Irish aren't known for their good food.  I take the vinegar over the oil.  He likes the vinegar.  I'm telling you.  He'll drink a douche before he'll go to Naples.  Yeah, there you go.  When they fucking take a garlic clove and just fucking burn it.  With fresh thyme.  And then throw it in some oil and shit. 
[03:33:30]  You just sit there and go, I don't need the uncle.  I don't need the uncle.  You got to grind up a little stagas on the cheese.  And then they call it a little, I go with the gal.  Yeah, you put a little abacata on the side.  Rest in peace.  So you put in your meatballs and your sausage, a little sugar, some wine.  Oh, my mother's sauce.  Rest in peace.  Cut the crap.  I got better things for him to be doing.  The old twat couldn't cook anything.  Fucking Ronzoni.  Rotten old bag.  Overrated old meat bag you called the mother. 
[03:34:00]  You got to take a little abacata.  Shut up.  Oh, she had a secret.  She put in some abacata.  Ronzoni.  You haven't heard that.  Ronzoni.  Ronzoni.  Sonabwani.  They have to be out of business.  That was their fucking catchphrase.  Is Ronzoni still in business?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Are they really?  I don't know.  Ronzoni.  Or some awful alcohol.  A little sprinkle of a little grain alcohol in it.  A fuckadouche.  Fuckadouche.  We got to explain to Nick.  Fight into some fuckadouche.  That's the best wine I've ever had.  The fuckadouche.  We got to explain to Nick where this comes from. 
[03:34:30]  The wise guys from The Sopranos.  They got a little radio show together.  Yeah.  This shit really pissed you off.  I've never heard of them.  And they sit around and everything has to go in this direction.  Oh, yeah.  The Italian.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They could be talking about the election.  And I'm trying to get on the radio.  Right.  That's why I'm telling you.  Just to annoy you even more.  And my grandmother, we go over there every Sunday.  She'd have a big thing of pasta.  And then we'd have the fish dish in the Gouman Ligal.  And the shit.  Yeah, right.  Shut the fuck up.  But they do that with news events.  That's what really drove us nuts.  Yeah.  Forget about it. 
[03:35:00]  Yeah.  Should we?  Hey.  Who is it?  It's past story, right?  Yeah.  Who else?  I've actually only heard it.  I have no idea who's on it.  Sherpa?  Probably.  I don't know.  Big pussy.  Yeah.  Bobby Bacala.  We gave them a beating a couple years back.  Not that.  We played a bunch of their audio.  It was just like, oh, my God.  Everything has to go back to your own things.  And then some guy that got fucking whacked that no one knows their name.  They had to get three guys.  Who the fuck is this?  He was in episode two.  Well, they're talking about all of all. 
[03:35:30]  And we're talking about horse pussy.  So I don't know.  Yeah.  It's all about balance.  It's all about diversity, right?  You cut that horse pussy up like a galamad.  It's what you got to do.  Like a galamad.  No, I pull the whole thing.  I pink sock the horse, right?  And then I chop it into slices like a galamad.  And you fry it up with some sauce.  Ah.  I'm on, John.  Ben.  Ben.  Ben.  Pink sock horse galamad. 
[03:36:00]  Oh, my stomach.  Oh, I can.  I don't even want to hear the show now.  And then if one chimes in, my grandmother would even fry up the asshole.  Oh, that's the best.  That's the best part.  That's the best part.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's a sin to throw it away.  A sin.  A sin to throw it away.  My uncle would look forward to the holidays.  That's the only time she had a whole asshole.  Yeah.  Because it was a sin to throw it away. 
[03:36:30]  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  She passed on.  Rest in peace.  She passed on.  She was fucking.  She was murdered in a fucking hit over a prohibition argument.  The asshole.  The asshole.  The asshole.  The asshole.  The asshole's the best.  It's always the most disgusting part of an animal.  It's like, no, that's the best part.  We was eating lamb head once.  That's right.  My grandmother used to make lamb head.  My grandfather would pick at lamb head. 
[03:37:00]  I did as a kid.  Oh, really?  Yep.  Honestly, I had the teeth still in it.  Yeah, the teeth.  Fucking, you're eating a skull.  You ever?  A fucking skull.  And it's already eyeballs.  I used to put a hat on it.  I used to put a little old guinea hat on the fucking thing.  A little derby.  Like fucking.  Like Clemenza war.  I used to go, Papa.  Papa.  Am I the only one that ate.  Drop the gun, old olive oil hands.  Dry blood.  The goat's blood.  They used to fry it.  Fry that up. 
[03:37:30]  Am I the only one that ate chicken asshole growing up?  Oh, that's an Irish thing.  You never ate chicken asshole?  Anybody?  I'm the only one?  Yeah.  The fucking asshole hangs off the chicken.  It's its own thing.  Oh, that's the best part.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  It's shaped like a.  Like a little heart.  I eat that.  In beak sauce.  It's wonderful.  You fry up the beaks.  What?  I like that.  I think my dad liked it, so I wanted to like, you know, be one with my dad, so I started  eating chicken asshole.  That was my nickname in high school.  They called it the Ogubi Gosh. 
[03:38:00]  You get a ball of mosquito assholes, you melt them down over a piece of like a bread,  and you soak it into sauce.  Shut up, you fuck.  Oh, shit.  It's so true.  Oh, it's wonderful.  Great, great, great.  You never ate chicken asshole?  Chicken asshole?  No.  You take their toenails and their beaks, and you fry them up with some garlic and butter,  and make a garlic butter beak toenail sauce.  And you pick your teeth with a playing card, and you wonder why nobody likes you. 
[03:38:30]  Oh, my God.  I love this fucking shit.  I guess it hits home because of my grandparents.  Oh, it was always my grandpa.  Sick as shit like that.  We'd do eel and shit as a kid.  Oh, eel.  My grandma used to cook eel.  It's delicious, though.  You'd pay 40 bucks at Batali's restaurant today.  Of course.  And I didn't know.  This is shit that should be in the garbage out front. 
[03:39:00]  Yeah.  And the fucking Italians are eating this shit.  Yeah, we were poor.  Ugh.  It's an animal with no hands.  Don't eat it.  Just let it be.  It's not like poor people today.  They live on fucking Jolly Ranchers and snowcaps and Mountain Dew.  Fucking bitch.  They eat pig's feet.  Yeah.  Of course.  Pig's feet, pig's knuckles.  I love a nice baseball hat full of mollusks.  Ah, mussels.  Pour it in there.  Trying to eat mussels and just, like, fucking biting down on sand. 
[03:39:30]  We used to mash the goat's ball with a bocce ball.  Smash them up a nice.  You gotta do it with a bocce ball.  My grandma would cook them with a fucking blowtorch.  We'd put them for the stove.  There's no stove.  But we ate.  Every night we'd sit down.  The whole family would eat.  We'd marinate that a fucking rooster cunt and a red wine and a gully.  Some nice bread.  There's confusion out there.  Everything's got bread.  There's confusion out there. 
[03:40:00]  My uncle was not named chicken, okay?  Fucking asshole.  Chicken asshole.  Never eat your uncle's ass.  Dicks.  Fucking dicks that listen to this show.  Go fuck yourselves.  I know.  They're pretty mean.  It's a mean country.  That's why we love them, actually.  Who are we kidding?  You want to learn about ghosts in Philly?  Nick, I interrupted you.  What do you got?  I was just asking.  So I can watch the game on Channel 11 tonight?  That's what I'm hearing.  That's what I'm hearing.  Not in New York, though. 
[03:40:30]  Not in the New York market.  Seriously?  No.  No, look at his eyes.  It's his mouth that gives it away.  I don't see Jimmy much anymore.  I used to see him all the time.  It's the downturned mouth that does it.  Because I'm going to laugh.  You can always see Jimmy's lying because you barely move your mouth like this.  I look like Obama's wife.  I used to be able to read him.  I can't read him anymore.  What time's the game on?  7.30.  8 o'clock.  You got Virginia Tech at Miami, too.  Well, there is a game.  Hey, watch the game.  I got 1,500 on.  You come over. 
[03:41:00]  Hey, come out.  I'll have Marie mix up some fucking...  Marie.  I used to be friends with their body parts.  Call her up.  Have her cook something.  That's her job.  Don't worry.  You come over.  That's her fucking job.  That's right.  She's going to make a Capoducutti.  Last minute.  For dessert, we're going to have a nice macaducs of pie.  She'll cut off her own feet and cook them for you.  I don't give a shit.  Oh, my grandmother's heels.  Rest in peace. 
[03:41:30]  Mother's heels.  My grandfather got prostate cancer.  Rest in peace.  It was delicious.  We fried up with those ass polyps.  You cooked those up.  It's all how you slice them.  Because they're a little tough.  No, no, no.  You got to slice them.  Marinate them.  Anything.  Ass polyps over white beans.  Manga.  You can't beat it, you ass a polyp.  Manga.  The fucking ass a polyp.  Nice.  You pound them.  Some fresh lentils.  Fresh lentils. 
[03:42:00]  Lentils.  Lentils over the polyps.  Is there anything worse than lentils?  No.  No.  Yeah.  Ass a polyps and scuttle.  Oh, me.  I'd rather eat a bowl of those fucking fat skin tags than fat people have.  With some babagalooch.  No, with lactate milk.  With fat man's skin tags and a bowl of lactate milk.  Oh, fuck.  I'd rather eat that.  The skin tags from under a fat man's arms.  Some old WAP skin tags from where his neck is brown because he's fat.  Yeah, I want to just chew those things off. 
[03:42:30]  You just came up with the most disgusting meal ever.  Clemenza fucking Clemenza skin tags.  And lactating milk on top.  And lactate milk.  Yeah, the lactate milk is what kills me.  Yeah.  You don't have the farts, you know.  Ah, that's wonderful.  And blow a snot rocket on top for taste.  Good stuff.  Are we going to learn about ghosts?  I think we should.  I'm fighting.  Yeah, you think?  Yeah, what is this?  I don't give a shit.  I don't give a hootie.  I'm just starving now with all this food talk.  Nick.  Yeah.  Sounds so good. 
[03:43:00]  We're live till noon if you want to take us to noon.  It's up to you.  I know you miss radio.  Like you haven't done enough yet.  But, you know, I...  Ah, fuck.  I could go to Fox, man.  I got to do...  I was over there.  I just want to give you the...  Who else is going to be on the panel?  What?  I'm asking Nick who was going to be on the panel.  I don't know until I get over there.  What time is that on?  Noon.  On where?  On FoxNews.com.  People are checking that shit out, man.  They are checking that shit out.  Oh, yeah. 
[03:43:30]  Two weeks ago, it's only been up a month, month and a half.  I was getting three million hits a day after two weeks.  Not even...  Wow.  That's awesome.  It's fun.  We got ghost hunters in Philly.  There's an x-ray technician in Philadelphia who is not giving up his search for ghosts.  Don Pollack explains.  Traditionally, many contact with spirits from beyond is attempted using crystal balls or  Ouija boards.  But what x-ray technologist and freelance ghost hunter Louis Giroux uses is anything but traditional. 
[03:44:00]  Electromagnetic field detectors, thermal scanners.  There is not one device that is designed specifically for ghost hunting.  But we do utilize detection equipment to try and capture some sort of tangible evidence  of spirit phenomena.  A quest that has taken members of the Philadelphia Ghost Hunters Alliance.  I don't feel like focusing on this.  I don't either, because the reporter's voice was too awful.  Yeah, I don't really feel like even trying.  No.  Fuck it.  There's some ghost hunting ghost down there. 
[03:44:30]  It just hit me.  Like, it's going to take too much work.  After all that talk of Italian food, I can't focus.  You're going to have to concentrate and focus.  Who knows that shit at 11 o'clock?  Not me.  Let's go to Bill in Charleston.  Bill.  Hey, my grandpa used to make this stuff.  It was kind of like goulash, but he'd always say, it's a slum-a-gully.  He called it slum-gully.  Slum-gully?  Yeah, I like goulash, but that's what he called it.  What is it, actually?  It's like macaroni and hamburger.  It's like goulash.  It's if you pour, it's everything in your fucking cabinets and refrigerator. 
[03:45:00]  Hamburger helper, guys?  Yeah, thrown in hamburger.  It's what you see when you open up a fucking gut shot.  Yeah.  Fucking goulash was awful.  All right, you keep talking.  I didn't mean to try to chime in.  It's all about you, sir.  I apologize.  I'm just a thought in your head.  Go ahead.  Go ahead, sir.  I'm just an actor in your play.  Go.  Did you?  Did you?  Did you?  Did you?  The name of the restaurant was called the Guinea Grinder.  Yeah, that's true.  Oh, no, I have to get some racist shit.  I hope somebody...  You know what?  All this Italian talk reminds me of Pat Cooper. 
[03:45:30]  He would fucking talk about his fucking...  What he's talking about is...  Let's do this.  My father.  And the shits his father would take.  Not a scent.  He would go to the bedroom.  Not a scent.  And not a smell.  Not a scent from this man.  The respect he had for his family.  All right.  No, but you're missing the best part.  The father's shit didn't stain.  What?  And then...  No, he's talking about how his father had nothing but respect and this and that, right?  Yeah. 
[03:46:00]  Two minutes later, he's talking about how he got hit over the head with a pipe from his  father and the father left the family.  He bashed the shit out of him.  This is a little confusing there, Pat.  My father would beat us, but it taught us.  Because it taught us to be good.  And kids these days don't have that respect.  He would go to the...  He didn't even say bathroom.  No.  What did he say?  The...  The Buckhauser?  Yeah, whatever.  The lava tree.  And when he went, there was not a smell. 
[03:46:30]  Not a scent.  Out of respect.  All right.  But he'd smack you over the head with a pipe.  Yeah.  For fucking...  What happened to dad's saying, damn it?  That man went into the bathroom.  Nothing.  Not the scent.  He scum right out of him.  Yeah.  And then what happened to him, Pat?  Oh, he beat the shit out of me.  He punched my mother in the face.  And left us when I was 12.  This man.  What?  Nothing but respect.  This saint.  He called him a saint.  Where would your dad go?  He set me on fire. 
[03:47:00]  He set me on fire.  We're sitting here like, what are you trying to tell us?  He was a true man.  The respect.  Right.  Respect.  Yeah.  What are you talking about?  Beat you around the house.  I think we did it all today.  Yeah.  We even got to horse pussy, which makes me proud.  Yeah, well.  I don't touch on that every day.  I got to go home and nap.  Yeah, I'm getting the fuck out of here one time.  What?  What?  What?  I got shit to do.  How are you going to nap?  I got a house full of construction workers. 
[03:47:30]  I was going to say, how are you going to nap with those people?  Hammering down stairs.  Go up to the third floor.  Take the elevator up there.  You've got a real mansion dining, don't you?  I'm trying.  Old Long Island.  Guys are regular Howard Hughes.  You could have bought Mastic.  You should see me.  Like, you know, I got a girl over the house.  And I'm laying in bed and she's coming upstairs and I'm like, did you lock the door?  Did you shut the back door and lock it?  All right.  Punch in the alarm and the key.  Punch that. 
[03:48:00]  Could you shut that light out?  Shut the door now.  No, now you've got to latch because I've got double doors on my bedroom.  No, you've got to slide the latch up for the one door.  And then when you shut the other one, lock that.  I'm like, locked the fuck in.  What are you, get smart?  Locked.  You know something?  I'm hearing people coming into my house.  I'm hearing people coming over my fucking house.  I'll hear a few doors have to open.  I've got the alarm.  Some noise has to be made.  Oh, yeah.  And the alarm.  Got to set that alarm.  Who are fucking idiots that go, you know, 
[03:48:30]  and the intruders came through an open window that was left downstairs.  Good for you.  Fuck.  Before you know it.  You have a nice summer day.  You like that summer breeze coming in as you're trying to sleep.  Yeah, that summer breeze is nice when you've got a phone cord around you at neck  and you're watching your wife getting fucking pounded up the ass by three guys.  Hot.  Saying, maybe I should have locked that window.  It's not all bad.  They knocked over the enter here sign when they were climbing through the window.  Yeah.  What's wrong with you, man?  You should have prepped the bull and everything would have been okay.  Prepped the bull?  Yes.  Why?  Just prepped the bull. 
[03:49:00]  Oh.  Line of the day is brought to you by Jim's Fart and Webex.com.  Hold meetings, make presentations, do it from the comfort of your own home or office.  Check it out at Webex.com.  Here's a runner-up line of the day.  How funny would it be if there was a Flux University?  Oh, the t-shirts.  Jim, he's very clever.  Just a thought.  Just want to throw around the table. 
[03:49:30]  I want to bring back what did we learn badly.  What did we learn?  Do we switch out line of the day for a while, rest in, and do a little what did we learn?  You know what?  You bring up a good point.  Fuck line of the day.  Really?  Yeah, we'll bring back what did we learn, and then line of the day.  Just to change it up a little bit.  And then we'll go, remember line of the day?  Wow, why don't we bring that back?  One of my favorite bits we don't do anymore is what did we learn?  Because it's just a nice way to wrap up the show.  Very educational. 
[03:50:00]  Everybody gets involved, and they pick up on what they learned on that show.  Let's start.  Can we start that Monday?  I mean, the sponsor won't give a shit.  Of course, as long as we're saying Webex.  Yeah.  I don't care.  And then we rest line of the day.  We'll bring that back.  Yeah.  Just to change it up a little bit.  No?  Yeah.  Jimmy, you're in on this vote.  I'm all for that.  Yeah?  All right.  I don't like it.  There's the last...  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Now we got to deal with Nick.  Now we got a problem.  Oh, another country heard from...  Another country heard from... 
[03:50:30]  What?  I might have missed that.  You never heard that expression?  It's an awful expression.  What is it?  When someone says something, someone will go, another country heard from...  You never heard that?  I swear to God.  I don't know if I've ever heard that one.  You've heard that, right?  Yeah.  I've heard it.  I've heard it in another country.  Another country heard from...  I was sheltered growing up, so I didn't hear that.  Yeah.  Wow, look how hot she looks with the messy fucking bedhead.  It looks like she's wearing a fall.  One of those wig lit things.  Would you?  Would I?  No.  Why not?  She's too old.  I heard it in real life.  No. 
[03:51:00]  I was talking to somebody...  Nick, would you?  Yeah.  Oh.  Yeah.  Yeah, I would say.  I was talking to somebody at Fox that's, you know, met her or whatever.  Some young guy, like I already said, she looks way better in real life.  Really?  It looks like her body ain't bad, but who knows?  You know, like, yeah, a set of tits.  I don't know.  How many kids she got?  She's got to have that belly going.  Five.  That fucking lasagna.  Yeah.  The decorative fucking window treatments.  Yeah, she's outside.  Window treatments.  I think most and shit, you know.  Her stomach looks like window treatments.  Yeah, fucking shoe bag. 
[03:51:30]  She's awful.  Especially after that last one came out.  Oh, my God.  Really stretched out with that head.  They had to open the pussy with the jaws of life.  Oh, fuck.  They were pulling a fucking...  Oh, Christ.  Nick, I got a tough one for you on the other TV, would you?  Who?  The guy?  Right now.  Oh, well, the guy probably would like it more than Martha.  You would?  Oh, absolutely.  Martha, that's an old bag.  Look how big her hips are.  Get the fuck out of here.  Who wants to switch anything on a...  Oh, I thought you meant when I talked to her.  No. 
[03:52:00]  Would you brush her fucking...  See, look at that.  Do that up there.  Absolutely.  Grab her.  Any of these news women.  Would you brush...  Would you fuck Martha Stewart if she promised to take the Mickey Rourke look off her face?  But would you for, like, the story, Nick?  She is a penis.  But would you for the story?  What story?  I fucked an old, disgusting broad?  Yes, that's a great story.  That's horrible.  Have you ever fucked a Martha?  No!  Why would I want to?  I didn't either.  That is terrible.  Look at her tits.  They're...  Ugh. 
[03:52:30]  They're all squeezed into that buttoned shirt she's got.  They're not big.  She's turned into a flatso.  Big fat ass, no tits.  Yeah, she looked better a few years ago.  She did.  All right.  The prison years were good for her.  Caged heat.  Yeah, she came out ripped.  Yeah.  This is the transition.  We're still doing line of the day, but we're still...  And now we're going to start a little...  What did we learn just for the new listeners so they know what it's all about?  Rob on Long Island, what did you learn today on the O.P. and Anthony show?  Hey, I learned that Obama's president, nah.  See?  Obama president, nah! 
[03:53:00]  That's what I heard this morning.  Yeah, nah.  That's what I heard this morning.  Obama president, nah!  First of all, no.  Bush's president, nah.  Obama's going to be president in January.  So just shut the fuck up.  And stop walking in front of my car.  Oh boy, you got him going again.  Another runner-up line.  Have a good night of the day, thanks to Webex.com.  Rings today.  Oh, you're there tomorrow?  I got a 945 at the Wilbur.  All right, cool, man.  So you can go see both.  If you already have Regan tickets...  Go see Jimmy. 
[03:53:30]  I wonder why I didn't sell out yet.  I'm like, I got like 40 tickets left.  I mean, I'm close to selling it.  And that explains why.  There's 2,000 of them being eaten up across the street.  Frick.  Good job, agent.  Book me against one of the biggest touring comics.  I'm literally like across the street.  It's amazing.  Is it really?  Yeah, they're going to hear his set coming through the wall.  And also, there was the comics come home on Saturday, too.  Yeah.  It was a tough time.  And you still did unbelievable, Jimmy.  Yeah, I got like 40 more of those motherfuckers. 
[03:54:00]  Fox Business Channel has a chick that ain't that bad looking.  Where?  Let's take a look.  I don't know if they're just going to keep showing how the Dow is going down or...  It's like Madeleine Albright.  Which one?  The one on the left looks like China.  No, no.  The one on the right...  This one?  No, no.  Yeah.  She's got a stroke face.  Yeah.  The one on the right wasn't bad.  But now they're not showing her, so...  She wasn't bad.  I'm fucking...  Believe me, I'm done with news chicks.  Anyway.  Oh, yeah.  You did that.  Fuck them.  They're crazy.  Yeah.  You should try Weatherman. 
[03:54:30]  See, I'm champion.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He'll find a young boy's clothes in my closet and burn them.  Fucking lunatic.  You heard how that one ended, right, Nick?  Yeah.  And burnt the clothes.  Yeah.  What a nut.  Just don't bring up Gene Simmons.  Here's another run-riff line of the day.  He doesn't.  He just cries.  Right.  And tells people to spray stuff on their salad.  Yeah.  And they'll lose weight.  Yeah.  You ever try that crap?  Spraying a little...  I don't know.  It doesn't work.  He tries the other way.  He sprays stuff on his face out of another dispenser. 
[03:55:00]  Yeah.  Then he rubs lettuce on it and eats it.  Holy jeez.  Look at Nick turned into the hole on that one.  Oh, guys.  Turned into Archie Bunker.  Oh, jeez, dude.  Holy jeez.  What a spray on his face, huh?  It's mixed company.  That's why they call him Meathead.  He's just kind of...  For different reasons.  Now we go over here.  Pearson, Ohio.  What did you learn on the Opie and Anthony show?  I learned that Brian Regan is a racist.  Yes.  We learned that early on today. 
[03:55:30]  You shouldn't even kid about that one, Brian.  See?  Yeah, right?  Brian's like...  Today's atmosphere.  The beauty of the bit.  You don't have to explain.  You're just like...  I heard.  Here's another runner-up line of the day over here.  Yes.  I got that little part of the wall that goes in.  Maybe we can put it there, and that'll be right near the bar.  The part of the wall that goes in.  Shower?  Isn't that called the corner?  Yeah, well...  Ah, fucking Regan.  He is a racist.  You guys. 
[03:56:00]  What happened, Jimmy?  I'm just in pain, man.  You all right?  What's going on, Jimmy?  Fucking...  Probably from farting you.  Sprained his back.  I was in the gym and just fucking hurt.  Slipped a disc.  That's when you know you get out.  I'm all farting.  I hope it's hurting like Edward Norton in American History X.  Oh, what did he get raped?  Boy, did I stutter that one out.  No, your herp is hoping.  Herp is hoping now.  I'm a hee-ba-da-hoo-ba-da-hee-ba-da.  I'm a hee-ba-da-ba-da-ba-da.  Hey!  You're talking to get a mouth full of...  Oh, sus.  Can I go over here for another run right now? 
[03:56:30]  Can I get a whoop-whoop?  What?  Oh, we're up to the line of the day?  Oh, here we go.  We have what did we learns, though.  Fuck the what did we learns.  That gut she's got.  Look at the gut on her.  Yeah, she's a fucking...  And does she know enough about TV not to wear a shirt like that?  Yeah, exactly.  What is that?  Like a test pattern?  She does TV for fucking years, and she's wearing one of those shirts that fucking...  I know.  They turn into an illusion, an optical illusion.  And a Kelly Leak hairdo fucking bothers me.  Let me wear pinstripes on television.  Oh, this I can't handle the negativity.  Oh, Jimmy. 
[03:57:00]  Jimmy is so gassy today.  Why are you so gassy today?  Jimmy just leaned over the console at a 90-degree angle and blasted a fart out.  Why are you gassy today, Jimmy?  Yeah, you are really gassy.  What did you eat?  What did you eat?  And that Nick's spraying Windex at him.  Well, yeah.  Just anything.  Whatever he can find.  I can actually shine his fart bubbles.  Jimmy, why are you so gassy?  Oh, now it's shit and lemon scent.  Why the gas, Jimmy?  I don't know.  Yo, what's going on?  What did you eat?  What's up, Jimmy?  I don't know. 
[03:57:30]  Talk to us.  Did you eat something different?  Did you have a bowl of fucking raw onions before you came?  No, I had some total lessons.  Oh, fucking total.  You're too old for total.  I was always for the young.  Total shit and roadkill.  Right.  What the fuck?  Wow, is that bad?  You guys, what are you embarrassing?  You made me think about what I did here.  What, you mix in sour milk, too?  Holy fuck.  I want to do the fucking extra hour.  That is fucking horrible.  What are you just saying?  Jimmy, a smell came out of you that is reserved for fucking corpses. 
[03:58:00]  Thank you.  There's cereals that you shouldn't be eating anymore.  I like total.  Now that you're 40, you can't be eating total.  You can't be eating raisin bran anymore.  Nothing bran, for that matter.  Oh, total is fucking mad.  Wow, did he fucking stink this studio up.  Total owns.  I used to love total, but I'm not stupid.  I know I can't eat that shit anymore.  Total, it was late last night.  I was hungry.  I said, let me have a little bottle of total.  And what cereal can't you eat now that you're a little older? 
[03:58:30]  Minus raisin bran, without a doubt.  Raisin bran will pour out of me.  I actually go to the supermarket and I see raisin bran on the shelf and I actually weep.  It's so good.  Because I love raisin bran, but I know I can't eat.  I can't do grape nuts.  And all these cocoa puffs.  I can't do grape nuts.  Cocoa crisps.  Count chocolate.  What was it?  Count chocolate.  Yes, any cocoa things I steer clear of.  I'd like a bowl of Aran berries, please.  What cereal can't you eat?  It's definitely raisin bran.  Raisin bran.  And I love raisin bran.  I love it, too. 
[03:59:00]  It's good, but...  Let's have a raisin bran morning.  Oh, fuck.  You want to do that?  You'll get gurgling in my guts.  But we need some kind of doctor to tell us how long it would take.  Dude, I know from eating it, it's really quick.  All right, let's do raisin bran morning.  It's not instant, but it's fast.  I'll eat raisin bran.  I love raisin bran.  I'll do a raisin bran morning.  We were supposed to have a gas off like three years ago.  I'm going to eat White Castle next week.  Oh, yeah.  And the next morning, I'm going to come in and fucking start teaching some matters.  White Castle and White Castle...  Not to be confused with my house. 
[03:59:30]  Cut with Taco Bell and onion dip for dessert.  And I will win this contest.  Jimmy, when are you back?  Monday?  I'm back.  Monday.  Monday is raisin bran Monday.  Monday.  Raisin bran Monday.  You want to do raisin bran Monday?  Yeah, fuck yeah.  With whole milk?  With whole fucking milk.  No fucking, like, skim or lactate or anything.  We're going to go whole milk and raisin bran.  And I'm going to eat a whole thing of grapes, too.  What time do we have to do this?  A grape?  What the fuck are you looking at?  Starting right at five.  Our assholes are going to fall out.  Right at five, man.  We'll be sitting on coiled up assholes. 
[04:00:00]  You're going to have hunger tail like the starving African kids.  They're fucking six inches here.  Colon will be hanging out.  And you know we're all going to just be sitting around waiting for the first fart.  Oh, it's horrid.  The first fart's going to finally hit, and then it's just going to be like, then the fucking floodwaters are going to start pouring out.  Your asses are going to look like fucking baboons at Lion Country Safari.  Yeah, pink it open.  What, Iraq?  My buddy said that.  My mom was eating at my house when we were kids.  My mother goes, Bob, you hungry?  He goes, I got hunger tail, for Christ's sake, Mrs. DePau.  Hunger tail? 
[04:00:30]  That's an actual term they used to use.  Oh, shit.  Hunger tail?  Yeah.  Kids start to shit out their own intestines.  Yeah, there's nothing to push out, so.  Yeah.  Fucking an asshole starts coming out.  Yeah.  That's a good feeling, huh?  Wow.  That's wonderful.  Matt LaFarre from Queensbury.  He goes to all shows when Norton goes up north.  He writes, Ant's favorite.  Ah.  Hold on a second.  Ant's favorite cereal is Special K.  Oh, Special KKK.  Yeah, very good.  All right, here's your line of the day. 
[04:01:00]  Here comes.  Here comes.  Oh, wait, wait, no, really, really, I mean it.  Dude, I mean it.  Um, I totally didn't mean it.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, well, you fucking stop it.  Jimmy, that's how you act.  What?  He's a...  Dude, that was acting.  Like one of the bosses?  I don't know how to be one of the bosses.  What am I going to do?  Stop and go, hey, yeah, yeah.  Tonight, six o'clock, Providence, Rhode Island, book signing at Borders.  Right.  Privateist Road, whatever it's called.  Yeah.  Who gives a turkey?  It ain't about me. 
[04:01:30]  I'm me.  All right, why don't we, um...  Yeah.  Why don't we just go to it?  No, here comes line of the day.  Can you stop the fucking thing?  Line of the day.  You restart this ship.  No, no, I'll just do it.  Here comes line of the day.  Line of the day.  You didn't do it right.  It's my song.  All right, go ahead.  Here...  No, it's too long.  Here comes...  Line of the day.  Wow, this is cool to see it live.  Line of the day.  It's like seeing your favorite band live.  Yeah, but now we can't use it because you talked over it.  Yeah, that's the way people could record it that way. 
[04:02:00]  Even though we're not going to use it.  But I changed it a little bit when I never do it quite the way it's supposed to be done.  All right, do it again.  So they can record it.  How about here comes...  What did we learn?  What did we learn?  Here comes...  What did we learn?  What did we learn?  You're such an idiot.  There you go.  You just heard it.  That's famous now.  That's going to be heard for years now on this stupid show.  You're such an idiot.  Our show sucks.  I'm done with it. 
[04:02:30]  I'm getting out of here.  Raisin Brand Monday.  Remind us.  Raisin Brand Monday.  Can I get in for that one?  This is going to hurt.  I'm bringing a gas mask in.  And believe me, I have some.  We're all going to be in my basement.  By 11 o'clock, we're all going to be pink sogging from all the gas.  I'm getting a stomach.  I just listened to the prep for the show.  Our assholes are going to look like little leathery lifesavers on the floor.  Like we're all sitting on elephant trunks.  Fucking Raisin Brand Monday.  Nice. 
[04:03:00]  All right.  Like Ant said, the line of the day.  The line of the day.  What is that?  That's why I don't understand when you buy the DVD.  It's like, I already saw the thing.  Now I saw it.  I know.  That's what I imagine.  People will buy your DVDs and shit.  No, but seriously.  I didn't mean that.  I know.  The best part of it is you didn't mean that.  I didn't mean it like that.  You know what I mean?  Because you're just going, no, no, that's what I mean.  I really put my foot in my mouth.  Oh, we cut off the tail of the, what did we learn?  I guess my worth of the line of the day or whatever the fuck we're calling it. 
[04:03:30]  Goodbye, guys.  We're leaving.  When we come back, Nick might be here.  He might not.  Nick's going to Fox.  What the fuck are you kidding me?  I have to go over there and get in a fight with O'Reilly now.  I wouldn't stay here if I didn't have to.  O'Reilly fucking loves me.  He loves me.  Does he?  No, he doesn't.  Never heard of him.  Next time, Nick.  I just had to review my acting chops.  He thinks you're a liberal douche.  You're doing pretty good.  Nickdip.com.  Tarry Town.  Tarry Town.  November 28th.

[04:04:00]  Oh, that's the night before.  Oh, that's right.  Oh, is it right?  Friday's the worst night of entertainment.  No, Friday.  No, Friday weekend, Thanksgiving weekend is great.  Go see Nick.  Very funny.  Tarry Town Theater.  Music at night.  Bunch of seats.  Big, big hall.  Yeah.  Something Jimmy.  Yeah, probably too small for Jimmy, but perfect.  Next time we'll know, you're going to stop in and say hi to us.  Well, again, my agent, I apologize.  Thank you guys for putting me on.  It was a mix-up.  Love having Nick in.  My agent actually gave me the choice.  He goes, you want to talk to these guys yourself?  I said, no, I'll let you do it. 
[04:04:30]  It doesn't matter.  It worked out.  It's nice.  Well, that was nice of you.  It's nice having Nick in, a like-minded person, without having to go to a private meeting  behind lots of doors.  So it's a pleasure, Nick.  Wait, we can do this in public?  This is crazy.  This is beautiful.  You're listening to The Ted Show.  I'm Ted the Whale Watcher.  I'm Ted Hitler.  I'm Ted Hitler Jones.  The Ted the Jones part of the good part.  Dear Corinthian.
