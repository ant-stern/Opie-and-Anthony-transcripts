<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a caller, Barney, referencing a previous segment where Jim Norton jokingly described his ideal sensitivity training. This segued into a lengthy discussion about E-Rock's suspiciously timed "sick day," with repeated, unsuccessful attempts to reach him by phone.  E-Rock eventually hung up.  The hosts then launched into a substantial debate about Occupy Wall Street, with Opie sharing his personal observations from Zuccotti Park, highlighting the lack of organization and a cohesive message among protesters.  The discussion also included callers sharing negative anecdotes about fracking and the hosts’ reaction to a website featuring photoshopped images of an obese E-Rock.  The possibility of interviewing Joe Rogan about Occupy Wall Street was briefly mentioned.

The show continued with nonsensical banter about a fictional currency ("Sheck nurkers" and "flunks"), before transitioning to a heated discussion of Spin Magazine's top 40 comedy albums list. Jim Norton vehemently criticized the list's choices, particularly the ranking of Richard Pryor's *Live on the Sunset Strip* over other albums he considered superior, and the omission of Chris Rock's *Bring the Pain*.  He also lambasted the low ranking of Sam Kinison and the absence of several other notable comedians.  This was followed by a discussion of Rolling Stone's top 10 metal bands poll, focusing on disagreements over Dream Theater's placement and Led Zeppelin's inclusion, culminating in a live performance of Dream Theater's "Pull Me Under". The segment concluded with sexually explicit commentary surrounding Lindsay Lohan's personal struggles, impending jail sentence, and the possibility of her appearing in Playboy, alongside Jim Norton performing celebrity impressions and promoting his upcoming stand-up shows.

The next segment began with a discussion of a large black man's death from a diet pill overdose, swiftly transitioning to a critique of Michael Winslow's sound effects, including a playback of a less-than-impressive Winslow rendition of Led Zeppelin’s "Whole Lotta Love". The show then focused on a disturbing video depicting a judge repeatedly beating his 16-year-old daughter with a belt, prompting strong reactions from the hosts and callers who shared their own experiences with abuse.  The hosts used highly offensive language while discussing the video, the judge’s motivations, the daughter's reasons for releasing the video years later, and the mother's role.  The conversation briefly touched upon the Janet Jackson Super Bowl incident, FCC fines, and Herman Cain's sexual harassment allegations.

A significant portion of the broadcast centered on two main points: the FCC's decision regarding Janet Jackson's Super Bowl "wardrobe malfunction" (contrasting it with the severity of child abuse videos) and the promotion of an upcoming Opie and Anthony holiday event at the Hard Rock Cafe in Times Square. The hosts revealed they had secretly stopped hosting "Worst of the Week" for eight months without management's knowledge, leading to a confrontation.  This led to further discussion and criticism of E-Rock's alleged deceitfulness and his "fake sick day" to avoid addressing the issue.  Colin Quinn called in, discussing his tour, the annoyance of marketing jargon, and an upcoming Peter Boyle Foundation benefit (with the hosts mocking his unawareness of the foundation’s focus on multiple myeloma), and an anecdote about a party at Jennifer Aniston's house.

The final segment revolved around the ongoing conflict with E-Rock, who had called in sick but planned to attend a Conan O'Brien taping. The hosts and other on-air personalities, including Troy and Sam, debated the details surrounding the leak of this information, naming individuals, including Roland, involved in revealing E-Rock's plans, criticizing E-Rock's dishonesty and work ethic, and discussing the impact of his absence on the show's workflow.  The segment ended with E-Rock acknowledging his plans and a general consensus that he should attend the Conan taping. The hosts also promoted upcoming shows at the Stress Factory. Throughout the entire broadcast, the language was frequently profane, and the tone was irreverent and comedic, often employing mockery of colleagues and management.  Beyond the regular hosts, Colin Quinn was the only guest, appearing via phone.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Sirius XM. Today's O.P. and Anthony show will begin shortly.  In the meantime, we bring you some of the worst of O&A.  Let's go to Barney. Hey, Barney.  Hey, how's it going today?  I don't know. We're kind of just goofing off, it looks like.  All right, Barney.  You can continue at any time, sir.  Go ahead.  Hey, I was just the other day.  I don't get to listen to it very often in the morning,  but I have XM and I got to listen to the replays.  Jim was talking about the sensitivity training  and I damn near wrecked my truck when he says 
[00:00:30]  the only kind of sensitivity training I want is  I pull my pants down, have my sack hanging out,  and someone tickles it, and I go, ooh, that's sensitive.  Well, thank you, Barney.  Appreciate it.  Always got to have this loaded.  I don't know why I didn't like this.  Yeah, yeah.  Unfortunately, we are.  We missed the last part.  What was the last part of it that you liked, that your phone cut out?  When Jim said he would just pull his pants down  and have his sack hanging out, and someone would tickle it, 
[00:01:00]  and he would go, ooh, that's sensitive.  Wait, Barney?  Barney?  Yeah.  Your cell phone crapped out.  What was that last part again?  The last part.  The last part is when Jim says he pulls his pants down  and he has his sack hanging out.  Barney, you there?  Yeah.  Barney.  Barney.  You guys can hear me?  No.  I got him now.  The part was about we heard something about sensitivity.  Sensitivity training.  All right.  Can you hear me now?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, now you're fine. 
[00:01:30]  Now it seems pretty good.  All right.  Well, I'm on my way to work.  But, hey, I just said when Jim said the sensitivity training,  the only kind of sensitivity training he wants is he'll pull his pants down,  his sack will be hanging out, and someone will tickle it.  Barney.  All right.  We'll see you guys.  Goddamn.  Barney, hold it.  I hear you now.  Fine.  You crackled right when you said sensitivity training.  Okay.  One more time.  Sorry.  That's okay.  I just said when Jim was saying about the sensitivity training. 
[00:02:00]  Oh, yeah.  We were talking about that the other day.  Oh, yeah.  The whole thing was a goof.  Which line did you like?  Because the whole thing turned out to be a goof.  That was the one where you said the only kind of training that you wanted,  you would pull your pants down, have your sack hanging out,  and someone would tickle it.  The what?  Who would tickle what?  Your sack.  The sack of what?  His, um...  Your balls.  Oh, the ball sack?  Yes.  Well, I didn't...  We heard you every time, stupid. 
[00:02:30]  You see how bummed he got the more he had to repeat it?  Like, he's even hearing, oh, this sucks. 
[00:03:00]  I, uh, just was Jim's...  This story stinks.  Yeah, well, what I said was...  And now, the moment you've all been patiently waiting for,  it's the Opie and Anthony Show.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Yeah.  Why, why, why, why am I introducing?  Why, why, why, why am I introducing?  Man on the wing.  There's a man on the wing.  E-Rock took a sick day. 
[00:03:30]  Yeah.  I knew that would make Sam laugh.  E-Rock thinks he's under the radar.  E-Rock took a sick day today.  I think everyone should tweet E-Rock radio  and make sure his tummy's feeling okay.  Do you think he's sick?  Hell fucking no.  No, he's not sick.  He's not, no.  It is very rare anyone around here takes a real sick day.  Yeah.  But for some reason, when E-Rock does it,  we all pay attention.  Pounce on it.  You gotta pounce on that shit. 
[00:04:00]  E-Rock took a sick day.  Oh, look at this.  He called in fat.  Oh, that's not even...  That doesn't even make sense.  Why would someone have to call in fat?  Do you think he's faking?  We don't even know if he's sick or not  because he's still asleep.  You think he's occupying his fridge?  I mean, we could call him  and see if he's got a sick voice or not.  Yeah, let's call E-Rock and make sure he's sick.  We want to hear the sick voice.  He hates when you call him and he takes a day off.  Oh, does he despise it. 
[00:04:30]  How come I'm the only one who can't take a sick day?  Like, the best was his honeymoon.  We only bothered him for an hour.  He was gone a week, right?  Yeah.  He was infuriated.  In his mind, we completely ruined his honeymoon.  We ruined his honeymoon, right.  It was one lousy hour.  Not even.  We also said it's because Ant gave very obvious hints  as to the hotel and where they were.  And he said that pests, as they like to be called,  kept calling.  I believe it was Atlantis, wasn't it?  Yes.  Except you called it Fatlantis 
[00:05:00]  as if that was disguising the name of the hotel.  You know, I've got to listen back to this show sometimes.  It sounds like it's funny.  It's a great show.  But maybe two pests called Atlantis.  Hey, Carl.  No one was calling E-Rock's room.  No one gives a fuck on that level.  No.  Oh, God.  He'll probably get five tweets today  that he called out sick.  Atlantis is getting one phone call right now.  So, I don't know.  Did he get his little tummy ache, maybe?  No.  I don't know.  Maybe that's from abuse.  Just putting so many different things into it.  Yeah. 
[00:05:30]  Just dropping stuff in there.  It's coagulating and fucking...  I think his stomach would be used to it by now.  All that abuse.  Yeah, what's up?  Okay, he's on hold.  Oh.  Oh.  E-Rock.  E-Rock?  I can't find this one disc.  I know you're out sick today,  and I apologize for that,  but can you help me?  I'm a disc.  Why are you sick today? 
[00:06:00]  Does it matter?  How do you feel?  Yeah, how do you feel?  Is it your tummy?  I felt better.  To your head?  What do you want?  Oh, what's the matter, sweetie?  I want to know how you feel.  Yeah, we're very concerned.  Concerned co-workers that just want to know how you're feeling.  Yes.  To your head?  What are you looking for?  We just want to know...  Boy, you're very weird.  Yeah.  Like, somebody calling with concern is to your health.  We just have a bet, that's all. 
[00:06:30]  So we want to know if it's your tummy.  Tummy, head, cold, flu.  What was the other one we came up with?  Achy muscles.  Achy muscles.  Yeah.  Or just general fatigue.  Yeah.  Malaise.  Malaise.  Mayonnaise.  Do you, uh...  Come on.  Yeah, what is it, E-Rock?  We got a bet going.  Or, or, and this is a possibility, it's a fake sick day.  Oh, boy.  Because they've got to take a certain amount a year.  Yeah, of course. 
[00:07:00]  They're allowed to take their sick days any way they want.  I want to hear them talk a little.  Does he have that scratchy, sick thing when you call into your boss?  Oh, sore throat was one of them, too.  Okay.  E-Rock?  Mm-hmm.  Comment?  Comment?  Oh, no.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  He fucking hung right up.  He can't do that.  He can't hang off.  He just hangs on.  Oh, that's funny.  He's such a baby.  He's shirking his duties.  But that's why you don't...  He really is a baby. 
[00:07:30]  But that's why you don't leave your phone on.  I'm telling you, don't leave your fucking phone on.  I would leave it on, just not answer it.  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah, I'd be like, yeah, I ain't fucking answering that.  Nope, nope, nope, nope.  That's the show.  Fuck them.  And no.  Fuck them guys.  No good's going to come of that.  There's nothing I could do to help you out in the middle of the night, so I'll get to  you when I wake up in the morning.  No one is interrupting my sleep because they had a drunk driving accident in the middle  of the night.  Oh, damn.  That's ruthless.  What do you think? 
[00:08:00]  I think he's just taking a fake fucking day.  I think it's a fake sick day.  Fake sick day.  He's like, eh, you know, you take off a Thursday, you jump right from Wednesday to Friday.  It's like magic.  It's beautiful.  It's magic.  It's the middle of the week.  Back to the end of the week.  Well, honestly, it's not beautiful because just yesterday we were saying that the two  days you should never take off are a Tuesday or a Thursday.  No, I didn't think Thursday was a bad day to take off.  Thursday's a bad one.  No, like I said, you're jumping right to the weekend.  Wednesday's terrific.  No, because you've got to come in here tomorrow. 
[00:08:30]  That's stupid.  Best ever.  Friday or Monday.  Friday or Monday, best ever.  And then Wednesday breaks up the week.  No.  Wednesday makes it into two mini weeks.  I think you still have two days after a Wednesday, and that's bullshit.  If you could take a day off and then know that all you've got to do is a Friday, that's  a breeze.  So I think Thursday bridges Wednesday to Friday so nicely.  I took Tuesday off, and I feel like I'm working a whole week.  Of course.  Tuesday's the worst day ever.  It sucks.  Tuesday is no reason to take it off.  Tuesday is my Saturday.  Horrid.  Is it really? 
[00:09:00]  Tuesdays just suck, dick.  Every Wednesday is Sunday at Carvel.  I just know that much.  Oh, man.  Sean in North Carolina writes, which stomach hurts?  One, two, three, or four?  Oh, he's insinuating that he's a cow or a horse, some kind of equine or bovine.  They have multiple stomachs.  Now E-Rock's just being rude, hanging up on us like that.  What an asshole.  I know.  I understand you want to sleep in when you're fake sick, but fuck, man.  You can't answer the question?  Yeah.  You like the Fatty Rock site? 
[00:09:30]  Oh, he loves it.  I just stumbled upon it.  Oh, did you?  Yeah, I just Googled E-Rock.  FattyRock.com.  What was the one where they put Steve's sideburns on and looked just like Martini Steve there?  Yeah, they put some Microsoft Paint, I think it was.  E-Rock is still convinced that I'm running this website.  Oh, really?  Oh, really?  I'm actually not.  How many pictures is it up to?  Well, there's...  Holy shit.  ...260 pages.  Pages?  And there's 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4, 12 pictures per page. 
[00:10:00]  Wow.  So you're looking at about 3,000 pictures.  3,000 Photoshopped pictures of E-Rock photoshopped on a fat body, photoshopped into a place.  That's where you and E-Rock were on Jimmy Fallon that time.  Look at that.  He was fat and nude in your dressing room.  And fat E-Rock.  Wow.  Why is he right under the monitor?  It's distracting for me.  Should we just keep calling E-Rock?  Oh, he won't like that.  Well, I mean, there's only one way to answer a question.  That's all we want. 
[00:10:30]  It was an answer.  Like, what...  Yeah, what's wrong with you?  Mm-hmm.  Why are you out today?  And the last thing that any of us would want to do is assume.  Yeah.  And not get it straight from the proverbial horse's mouth.  Proverbial?  I'm going...  The literal.  I'm going fake sick day.  Yeah.  See, if E-Rock would have just said...  Fake sick day.  Yeah, I just don't feel good.  Yeah, my stomach.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  Well, is he...  Well...  Oh, boy.  Oh, God. 
[00:11:00]  Oh, God damn it.  That's brutal.  That is rough.  That is a rough picture, man.  Somebody turned their phone off.  Really?  Sick boy turned his phone off.  Oh, poor boy.  Yeah, the sex phone dumped straight to voicemail.  The sex phone.  Well, tweet E-Rock Radio and ask him why he's out today.  Is it E-Rock Radio?  I believe so, yeah.  E-Rock Radio.  E-Rock Radio.  You could tweet that and ask him yourself, right?  Yeah, yeah.  Well, maybe he'll tweet back.  Yeah, maybe he'll tweet something.  That'll be nice.  So we can move on with our radio show. 
[00:11:30]  Um, Occupy Wall Street.  Yeah.  Occupy Wall Street.  All day long.  Well, I guess, uh...  We were discussing this pretty heavily before the show today, aren't we?  Yeah, the New York Post has an editorial on the cover.  Right on the cover.  It just says, enough!  A big enough!  And it says, Mr. Mayor, it's time to reclaim Zuccotti Park and New York City's dignity.  Well, then it's a whole, uh, editorial about how it has changed from people going down there  with, uh, some kind of idea into, uh, a freak show of criminal elements, noise, uh, no goal 
[00:12:00]  whatsoever, and just filth.  Defecation on the sidewalks.  Yeah.  So they're, you're, they're, uh, urinating on the sidewalks.  So now they're calling on the mayor to do something, uh, and, and saying, saying that...  But, but, but, but, go ahead.  I just want to say, they're saying that if these people leave on their own accord, there  won't be violence or anything like that.  They're not allowed to be here anymore.  That's my but.  Yeah.  My but is very simple. 
[00:12:30]  It's the caveat.  The fucking mayor of Varsity and all the other cities allowed this to go too far.  Now it's very complicated.  You can't stop this fucking thing easily without...  You feel entrenched.  ...without major problems, because I was telling Ant, this damn Zuccotti Park is now a community.  People are, people really feel that's where they live.  Because they probably didn't have the greatest digs before this.  So now you move in and try to, you know, uh, reclaim the park.  Sure.  Sure.  They could do that, but it's going to get ugly.  It's going to get really ugly. 
[00:13:00]  Because Bloomberg's a pussy, though.  Yeah.  Like, can you picture Giuliani allowing this?  No.  No.  But we got problems in every city now.  How, how do you get rid of the occupies in, in, uh, in, uh, the cities across America?  Well, it is complicated now.  It started with the example of the lady who runs New York not doing anything.  Yeah.  She didn't do anything.  She didn't, she didn't do anything.  And in a way, I don't think, I don't think she should have at first.  Ms. Mayor?  Yeah.  Her honor?  I don't think she should have.  After a while, it got to be ridiculous.  Mm.  But at first, I mean, I still kind of like what the protesters, even though I don't, I think 
[00:13:30]  most of them, your assessment is correct.  That's gone.  That whole thing is gone.  That whole fucking, because look at what happened in Oakland.  Hold on.  We had veterans, uh, marching yesterday on Wall Street.  For what?  Yeah.  A whole nother thing.  It's in the paper today.  Yeah, I know.  But the veterans were walking on Wall Street yesterday, you know, because they're unhappy.  Yeah.  Unhappy.  So, I mean, so there's that element that is, uh, legitimate, but then you got this other  element that there's, there's, there's criminals down there, man.  It's scary fucking people that you would never hire, even if, even if we lived in, in a perfect 
[00:14:00]  society in their minds, they still wouldn't be hired.  They're scary fucking individuals.  They've turned into just a mob of people, um, living, uh, you know, a little vagabond type  existence there.  Love, they probably love all the people banging on their drums, making noise, screaming.  Like, if you were in a fucking apartment building doing that, the cops would come to your door  and fucking arrest you.  Yeah.  In your own house. 
[00:14:30]  Yeah.  They would drag you out because you're making noise and disturbing the peace.  Well, they-  And they allow this to go on all fucking night?  Well, they control, uh, they control the drum circle now.  It's, I think it's two hours a day.  Oh, really?  And the cops are strict.  They're like, okay.  They go like, that's all right, time is up.  And they have to stop immediately.  Shut up.  What the fuck is that saying?  You're not saying anything.  By doing that.  You don't like the drum circle?  Being annoying now, I hate it.  You never liked the drum circle?  No, the drum circle's dumb.  God, I like drum circles. 
[00:15:00]  I really don't.  Spackle buckets are for two things.  Holding spackle and shitting in.  Spackle buckets.  They, they, they hold two by fours and slam it down in the garbage.  Yeah, yeah.  I've seen that too.  I like a good spackle bucket player, though.  Fucking Q-man group.  But this is, this is, this has absolutely gotten very complicated.  Now it's very, how do you, how do you, you know, force these people out of these, these  places across America?  You got to go in there.  Complicated.  What is, what, I guess all the mayors of all the cities got to get, get together and go, 
[00:15:30]  okay, today's the day we do this.  Because you can't get rid of one.  Well, you can.  How?  I think you got to, you got to cut off the head, which is this New York one.  That's like the, the, the head.  That's the big one.  Get rid of it.  Fucking tell the people they have to leave and, uh, they got to leave like now.  Get your shit and then fucking leave.  And it's peaceful.  You can walk out.  They're not going to be peaceful.  Well, why wouldn't they be peaceful?  I've been down there.  Then they're the violent ones.  As soon as you tell someone to pick up their tent and beat it, I'm telling you, there's 
[00:16:00]  going to be major violence down there.  I'm telling you.  Oh.  You got to go down there.  These guys are entrenched now.  Great.  It's not just a park anymore.  Well, then they're going to get their heads fucking hit with, uh, nightsticks.  And a few of them will get tased.  They'll be maced.  They'll be dragged off in cuffs, screaming, the world is watching, and thrown into fucking,  uh, uh, vans.  That's, that's how it's got to work then.  I think that's what you're looking at.  And then get a bulldozer in there, just plow over the fucking shit, and, and stick it in 
[00:16:30]  a dump truck, and then fucking take it to the dump.  The park is, uh, mostly, uh, stone and concrete and all that, so it's just a couple power  hoses.  But all the tents, all the little structures they made, all that shit, right in the back  of a dump truck, and take it over to Staten Island.  It's, uh, it's going to be ugly.  There are a bunch of fucking assholes, uh, down there with no, no cause whatsoever.  None.  The cause portion is gone.  This has evolved.  It's mutated into some just fucking freak show. 
[00:17:00]  Well, they're, uh, all about, what is it called?  Fraction or fractation?  What is that word there?  What?  What is that?  Where they're digging and breaking the rocks to get the natural gas.  That's a new fucking cause?  That's a big one now.  What's wrong with that?  What is it called?  Frack, uh, help me out, somebody?  Oh, uh, frack gas morning?  Yeah, that's a big one.  That's a, that's a main focus on, uh, in New York especially.  Oh, and, and in Philly when I was walking around the Philly one. 
[00:17:30]  So.  Oh, well, this is coming in.  What?  This is interesting.  What?  The, uh, apparently, just a source.  Mm-hmm.  The police commissioner won't make a move because he's a mayoral hopeful.  Again, politics coming in, rearing its ugly head.  Well, because, because he knows.  He wants to be mayor and he makes, all of a sudden he's got this debacle on his hands if it goes bad.  It's going to go bad.  And he's got blood on his hands.  See, he knows it's going to go bad. 
[00:18:00]  He knows there's only one way that this ends and it's going to be with some bloodshed.  I'm, I'm, I'm serious.  He's waiting for, he's waiting for the mayor to give the, the go.  And the mayor probably wants him to do it.  They both are probably having a standoff because they both know that it could go badly and it may go badly and they want to give the blame to the other guy.  Mm-hmm.  Bloomberg stinks.  I, I think that everybody should just plant trees and hold the flowers.  Yuck.  It's called fracking.  Thank you, Spectro.  Fracking, yes.  A lot of people.  Fractionation. 
[00:18:30]  Yeah, but a lot of people are really not happy about this fraction.  What's wrong with that?  I was trying to watch it.  It's getting natural gas out of the ground.  Yeah, but it's poisoning the water.  There's all sorts of shit going on.  Yeah, what water's getting poisoned?  You got to watch the documentary.  I turn on the faucet, it's great.  Well, we got good water in New York.  Crisp and clean.  But they haven't really done a lot of fracking in this area, I don't think.  I think it's in a lot of...  It's in like North Midwest.  Pennsylvania.  It's starting to creep in Tari area as well.  And a lot of people are saying that people are getting sick.  What is it?  Really?  Mm-hmm.  Everyone fucking thinks any power source we can get makes people sick. 
[00:19:00]  Show me the proof.  Plus, it's just fucking up nature, man.  Is it?  That's what we do.  That's our job.  The people that enjoy nature and all of a sudden these big machines are coming in to,  you know, get their fracking done.  Fixes...  The Earth will fix itself after we're long gone.  We can't...  It's impossible for us to fuck this place up beyond, uh...  Beyond reclamation by itself.  Reclamation?  In the meantime, we just got to take the resources, use them.  If it runs out, you find another fucking resource. 
[00:19:30]  That's what smart fucking things do.  That's how bacteria works.  That's what we are.  Festering on this planet.  What did we just go over the fucking...  Three billion mark?  The four billion mark?  Seven billion?  What the fuck?  No, it's supposed to be 14 in, like, no time?  I'm pissed off by that seven billion thing because they showed the person who's the seven billionth person on Earth, I guess?  Who counted.  Yeah, who counted?  There's probably some other asshole that was born that is actually the seven billionth that will never get the credit. 
[00:20:00]  Some tells me there was a fuckload of seven billion sliding out a stanky gash in some horrid fucking, uh, uh, Bangladesh, uh, hut.  You think they chose the seven billionth for marketing purposes?  Yeah, I think it was kind of marketing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  I don't know.  People, people are so...  Look, dude, I'm telling you, fracking, don't fuck with the fracking people.  I love fracking. 
[00:20:30]  Fracking is, uh, a serious issue out there for a lot of people.  Let's go to Sean.  Sean.  Hey, hey, boys.  Good morning.  Hey, man.  Hey, I live out in Denver, and, uh, about a year and a half ago, they had an issue out here with the fracking.  People actually turning on their faucets in their kitchen and setting the water on fire.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Find that on YouTube.  Want to see that.  Sounds like urban legend to me, my friend.  Yeah.  No, I'm telling you, it was all over the news.  If you watch the documentary, I think they had it on HBO.  They were showing clips from, from Colorado. 
[00:21:00]  What was the name of the documentary?  Uh, I try, I really did try to sit through it, but the filmmaker was a bore.  I, I understand it's a serious subject, but you got to keep your viewers, uh, interested.  And I just had to fucking turn the damn thing off after half of it.  Yeah, I don't remember.  And they wanted the guy on our show, and I'm like, I was bored to tears.  I know it's a serious issue in the documentary and all, but I, I couldn't sit through the whole thing.  Hmm.  Yeah, I don't remember.  I saw it, like, it was maybe like a year ago.  Yep.  Uh, Gasland.  Thank you.  I don't believe that. 
[00:21:30]  It was Gasland.  That looked like a fucking gag.  What?  Gasland?  That faucet, that faucet thing.  I just saw it.  Well.  Where it goes, woof.  Kyle in Chicago.  Kyle.  Okay.  Good morning, boys.  Good morning, Kyle.  Um, fracking, they actually use close to about 150, uh, chemicals to break down the soil  and pretty much dissolve the rock.  And then it gets into the water, and people drink that shit.  Yeah, eat it.  I eat that shit. 
[00:22:00]  Come on.  I'm talking about selling fracks, Paul.  Help me out, Paul.  What do you say, Bill?  Yeah, it's like, people's horses, their hair fall out.  I mean, their animals are dying.  Yeah, there's...  Their craziest diseases.  It might be a real thing, though.  I mean, it's, uh...  I have no idea.  I'm just rambling.  Yeah, I mean, the chemicals they're using.  I mean, a lot of people are saying that, you know, their lives are different since this,  uh, fracking started in their area.  Well, it's actually, it was originally called fracking because this was happening on Fraggle Rock. 
[00:22:30]  No, that's below even chip.  I didn't say that.  But then you got the other side.  Fracking is actually creating jobs, so, you know.  I guess if you live in those areas, it's a big, serious issue.  But if you don't, I guess you don't care as much, huh?  Yeah.  Is that what we're talking about?  Yeah.  Come on.  You can't have fire coming out of your faucet.  That's cool as fuck.  That is cool, but...  I don't believe it, though.  Nah.  I think they hooked a little fucking... 
[00:23:00]  Little LP tank up underneath.  Why would they put a record player under there?  Oh, Jimmy.  Wow.  Maybe my jokes are coming out of that faucet.  Oof.  Oh, boy.  All right.  Enough with the fracking, I guess.  Dude, that's real...  Look at that guy.  That ain't got...  That's fucking...  Maybe we should have had the guy in from Gasland.  Yeah.  The movie was slow, though, man.  I was trying.  Yeah.  I was really trying, because I know it's a serious topic, but... 
[00:23:30]  So now there's people against fracking at Occupy Wall Street, which has nothing to do with that,  but okay.  Whatever.  Well, yeah.  If you've got something that you're against, you know, you could be heard down there.  No, because...  It's brilliant.  It gets lost in the fucking melange, is what happens.  It gets...  You don't...  You're not united in a single voice.  Let's see.  Now, a lot of people love ripping down the Tea Party and shit like that, but when the  Tea Party got together and held their demonstrations, it was for one thing. 
[00:24:00]  They did not want higher taxes.  They told their politicians that if they voted for higher taxes, they were not going to vote  for them during the midterm elections.  That's what happened.  Right.  It was a single united voice, no raping, no fucking filth, no drums, no fucking...  And it actually had an effect on the midterm elections.  But...  But the Occupy...  This is dumb.  But the problem is, a lot of people are trying to politicize this Occupy, and I'm not really... 
[00:24:30]  Oh, it's completely politicized.  In what way, though?  Lefties.  You think it's totally lefties?  They're all lefties down there.  I know your right-wing pals are trying to say that.  They're all lefties down there.  There's not any...  Why would anyone...  I don't even think there were a lot of Obama people down there that I've met.  They're either lefties or fucking anarchists.  You know?  Well, I mean, it seems like they're very organized.  So why wouldn't they...  Why wouldn't they focus on one goal at this point? 
[00:25:00]  Because there's a fuckload of nuts down there.  You can't organize crazy people to start talking in one single, united voice.  At the beginning, when they were all doing...  And Wall Street got bailed out, and we got fucking fucked up.  You know, that's one thing.  Now it's just drums and freaks and guys going into tents and fucking 18-year-old girls.  Rape and fucking this asshole that doesn't know what he's talking about.  I didn't know you had a tent down there. 
[00:25:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hi-yo.  You're occupying, huh?  Occupying.  Vagina.  My goal is to have at least a dozen occupied jokes on this show today.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, they are a joke.  Yeah.  That's what I say.  No, I guess I got to take a page from Troy Kwan's book, but I got questions.  Uh-oh.  I got hairstyling.  I got questions.  I got questions.  Oh.  Why don't they have one main focus?  Because it's like saying...  But it's easy for you to say what you're saying. 
[00:26:00]  I'm wondering if it's deeper than that.  That's all I'm saying.  What could be deeper?  Here.  I don't know.  Here it is.  We all have things that are passionate to us, right?  Right.  We all have things that are important to us, things that are in our lives that make our  lives better, worse, whatever.  Take not just this studio.  Take a few radio shows, some management.  Let's get them all together.  You had to fucking bring management into this?  Exactly.  And that makes the point.  Now, get them all together in one room.  And now let's try to get a single united voice on what would make our lives better. 
[00:26:30]  And good fucking luck to you.  That's what they got going on down there.  But...  They're not passionate about any one thing.  It's what the issue is.  When you get, you know, inside the actual park, there's some passion.  It's the outside people that are fucking up everything.  And I'm wondering why they're allowing the border people, I call them, to be fucking weirdos.  They got no power to get anyone out of there.  The actual protesters aren't in control.  But they have people doing jobs. 
[00:27:00]  They got people cleaning.  They got people cooking.  They got people...  Putting hats on pegs.  Putting hats on...  They got a marketing department where they're making shirts constantly.  So you're saying a police force that goes around and kicks out people that don't agree with their...  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  What are you saying?  What do you do with the border people?  You at least have people walking the perimeter and going, will you stop, you know, knock it off?  That's not helping our...  Like I said yesterday.  And get punched in the fucking face.  No.  They're crazy, some of these people. 
[00:27:30]  You got the guy that was scarfing down French fries in my latest video, right?  Yeah.  So you got enough people that have some kind of organization down there.  So why not have a group of people walking around and going, really, it's not helping our cause when you're fucking scarfing down McDonald's French fries.  Fuck you.  Now what?  Now what?  Fuck you, and I'm not leaving.  I don't know, man, because they listen at other times.  And they do defend their own.  There's a small core that I think are of the like mind. 
[00:28:00]  But I think the rest of them, especially the ones that are pouring in now, are a lot of people homeless and criminals.  I'm not saying you're wrong.  I'm not saying you're wrong.  You're probably right.  But I'm very suspicious that they're not controlling it more.  It's been contaminated.  That's a good word.  Controlling the message.  Because I see the organization down there.  It's pretty creepy, actually.  It's been contaminated.  Their whole area has been contaminated, so their message is contaminated.  They can no longer say it and have any media down there. 
[00:28:30]  But I wish we could talk to someone that knows more about this than we do.  We're just observers from the outside.  I'm just wondering.  That's all.  That's all.  Because, you know, I've made five videos so far.  I've been down there at least ten times.  And a lot of the people from my first couple of videos are long gone.  Yeah.  So were they ever part of the movement?  Or were they just freaks that showed up for a day?  You know what I mean?  Could be either.  But either one means that there's no real fucking drive toward one issue. 
[00:29:00]  Jesus Christ.  Don't you think if someone walked around and said, like you said, you can't go to someone, hey, you're fucking up the call.  If someone walked over and goes, look, dude.  There's a better way to say it.  Like, dude, if you're doing this, it kind of puts it on.  Yeah.  Most people down there, most people might go, yeah, you know what?  You're right.  I don't think people would resist it as much if you said it to them.  Like, you know, it's kind of hurting the cause a little bit.  Do you think those people that are for the cause even give a shit that someone's eating McDonald's?  They're eating McDonald's.  Don't fucking get it here. 
[00:29:30]  That's all the questions I got.  No one cares.  I would love to know more.  I'm suspicious.  That's all.  You're giving these people.  The other day I saw two protesters going at it, right?  And the one guy said, I will push your eyeballs into the back of your skull.  It was the most frightening thing I've ever heard and saw in my life.  Yeah, that's good.  And what happened at that moment when this thing started, everyone lifted their cameras  because everyone's looking for that next fucking viral video.  Hey, you want that big money shot.  Sure.  And all of a sudden they all got together immediately, made sure that confrontation stopped, and they started just chanting all at the same time, 
[00:30:00]  peace, peace, peace, peaceful, peaceful, something like that.  And so they're aware when it's something that is ugly that is not good to get out there.  They know how to stop it.  Maybe at this level and right now.  But, you know, we wouldn't need police if that was that easy in society.  When you see something happening, everyone steps up and goes, peace, peace, and everyone walks away, and it's wonderful. 
[00:30:30]  We don't need police.  We don't need an army.  Nothing.  This guy was a lunatic, and this guy looked, you know, in my humble opinion, like he probably did some jail time.  Yeah.  But he stopped when the group mentality got to him.  Maybe he had a little sensibility to him.  Who knows?  I don't know.  Maybe the next guy won't.  And you know what?  You're probably right.  I'm just suspicious.  That's all.  I just have no...  That a park that is so goddamn organized aren't doing basic shit like that.  And allowing, you know, I'll be honest, allowing me to go down there and easily film freaks on any day I want. 
[00:31:00]  Yeah.  Any fucking day I could go down there and film freaks.  It's so fucking easy.  And I'm suspicious of that.  Really suspicious.  Why?  I don't give him that much credit.  Is that helping the movement?  Creating interest when you get to see...  Because I'm not the only one.  There's a million videos of what I'm doing.  The movement has become the movement.  Like, it's not about a cause anymore.  It's just about having an Occupy somewhere. 
[00:31:30]  So that is now the movement without any real basis behind it.  There's no real fucking, hey, let's do this.  You think Oakland is united with New York, is united with Dallas and all these other...  And Philly in all singular ideology where they're like, here's what we have to do.  No, Oakland, last night or yesterday, they shut down the port.  And the longshoremen had to be fucking, you know, dragged away so they could open the fucking port up.  They had to tear gas people again. 
[00:32:00]  What do they do here?  Here it's Wall Street.  In Philly, what is it in Philly?  Homeless.  Homeless.  Looking for a meal.  So the whole thing, it's just an Occupy wherever, and that has become the movement.  So without a big singular voice, you're not going to fix eight million things that are wrong.  Sure.  And they won't unite behind one thing.  So this goes on until it's busted up.  I got suspicions.  Like what?  You got some kind of conspiracy thing.  You say suspicions, but I don't know where you're going with it. 
[00:32:30]  Because I don't even know, to be honest with you, but I'm trying to tear back some layers  because something about this whole thing doesn't make sense to me.  That's all.  That's all.  I think it's being allowed partially, I think, because when you look at what's happening around the world,  it's been fairly violent in some places.  In the U.S., it's been the least violent.  Oh, yeah.  And I think they know that if it's blowing off steam and it will pass or it will get stopped  and there's a way to do it without it being a gigantic mess. 
[00:33:00]  But the trend was it had to happen because it's happening everywhere.  We live in a very strict society.  I can talk for New York City.  You can't even get, let's say in my case, a little family kid party together in a park  without all sorts of permits and shit.  But they're allowing this.  You know what I mean?  And they're allowing this in all these cities that I'm sure have similar rules.  Hear about that guy that went down to Ashrogan Beach out on Long Island to clean up?  I fucking heard that.  Holy shit.  He's like, the beach is fucking dirty. 
[00:33:30]  It had debris all over it from some of the storms and everything.  You've got to understand, Ashrogan, there's naturalists that live in that area.  They fucking love their water and their nature there.  Big fucking time.  They love bird watching, all that shit.  North Shore of Long Island, a little strip of land tucked away off of the Long Island Sound.  And this guy decided, you know what?  I'm going to go on the beach and I'm going to clean up the beach.  And he did that.  And he was met by two officers that handed him summonses for cleaning up the beach because he wasn't one of the people that were supposed to do it. 
[00:34:00]  He wasn't doing it, as they said, properly.  And to me, it's like, here's a guy that just wants to go clean up the fucking beach.  And he wasn't even allowed to do that.  That's the country we live in.  Yeah.  Because, you know, he was sick.  That's a freedom?  What?  He was sick of seeing the garbage and whatever.  So he said, you know what?  I'll just do it myself.  We're not in a free society.  If you think we are, you're fucking crazy delusional.  Once again, then why are we allowing this?  Because we also have a balance of we can't go in there with tanks and run the people over. 
[00:34:30]  We've entered this weird place where we don't want this shit happening.  You think the people around there, the businessmen, and that's what they're talking about in the Daily News today.  The businesses around Zuccotti Park are suffering.  Are fucking, they hate this shit.  They're suffering.  They don't want, you know, you think someone wants to sit in a nice fucking restaurant with going on and screaming and just the stench of these fucking assholes?  You know, there's a Starbucks very close to there.  And I went in there, grabbed a cup of coffee, and I had to fucking take a leak badly. 
[00:35:00]  And it's probably maybe two blocks away.  And I've been in enough Starbucks where you know what a bathroom looks like.  Yeah.  And I go, you know, can I have the key to the bathroom?  They looked at me like, that's not a bathroom.  I'm like, it's a bathroom.  No, it's not.  That's an employee closet.  I'm like, no, it's a bathroom.  But they're figuring out ways to make sure their bathrooms aren't being destroyed by the occupiers.  Yep.  That's because they're sick of it.  Like you're saying.  Yeah.  So guess what?  The Starbucks is a very peaceful place and no one's in it. 
[00:35:30]  Because most of the people in the park just want to, you know, shit somewhere.  But you can't lay a hand on anybody down there, the police especially, without the media and everyone else with a camera videoing it and making you look horrible.  So they don't know what to do.  But they're looking stupid.  It's a stalemate.  Here's the guy with his whole face is tattooed.  Yeah.  You think...  In a cowboy outfit.  In a cowboy outfit. 
[00:36:00]  You think they want him walking the perimeter and giving his opinion on everything?  He looks like one of those anonymous masks that the hackers use as a symbol.  Right.  Yeah.  Well, there's a lot of those masks down there, too.  What is that mask called?  V for Vendetta.  Yep.  The movie.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  There's a lot of V for Vendetta masks down there.  That's kind of cool.  Guy Fox, right?  Huh?  Look, I love cops who smoke pot.  Why couldn't you police yourself a little bit and tell this woman, beat it?  You're not helping the cause with the I love cops who smoke pot sign. 
[00:36:30]  So you love the cop, and then when they piss test him and he gets fired...  Right.  What service have you done him by loving him?  You're probably right.  I'm just suspicious.  I don't see anything deeper than what's going on.  There's some political motivations going on here.  But no one is claiming these people as their own yet.  You know what I mean?  Who would?  What?  What would be the upside of claiming these people as your own?  Well, the Tea Partiers, right?  They were claimed, weren't they?  Yeah, but they were organized with a single voice.  And older to the older. 
[00:37:00]  And look, agree with it or not, I'm not agreeing or putting out there the virtues of the fucking Tea Party,  because everybody...  Whatever.  I'm just saying, they were an organized unit that had a singular goal.  Lower fucking taxes.  Do not raise my taxes.  Here's our agenda.  Here's our constituency.  Here's the politicians that are backing us.  And when the midterm elections come, we are voting against people that want to raise our taxes.  There.  There's a message. 
[00:37:30]  There's people gathering to get on the news and get a message.  Now, these motherfuckers have 8,000 different ideas from cops who smoke pot to fucking vets  against this to fucking homeless people.  There's too many things.  Who in their right mind wants to claim this collection of fucking assholes?  Right.  It's a detriment.  Jake in Jersey writes...  Michael Moore is just selling books, by the way.  Of course.  Jake writes, Oprah, you're confused because you're looking for something deep and there isn't 
[00:38:00]  anything.  It's just a question.  Yeah, maybe there isn't.  You know, maybe that's completely right.  I think there's nothing deep there.  I've been down there enough where I'm just suspicious because there's some big-time organization  deep in the park.  If they were that organized where there was something going on behind the scenes...  Do they organize people to collect laundry to get their laundry done?  It's easy to do.  They organize...  Cavemen did it.  They organize people to just scrub every surface down there.  Like, they could get people to do things immediately. 
[00:38:30]  Easy to do.  When you make a little microcosm society...  They've got a soup kitchen down there, basically.  You make a little microcosm society, it's easy to do, especially at the beginning.  Mm-hmm.  And then people start looking around and going, I'm cleaning up while this asshole's sitting  around.  And that's when you start getting the part of that society that starts breaking down and  going, hey, you're not doing your part.  Right.  Fuck you.  I'm doing my part.  And then you have an exact copy of what we have now as the country.  I got you.  It just happens.  At first, it seems very utopian and fucking amazing. 
[00:39:00]  And then it just turns into the same shit because people have wants and needs and other  people don't want to do things.  Well...  And other people are motivated.  Other people aren't.  Didn't America kind of do that?  Yeah, exactly.  We hated their rules.  We come over here and we're slowly...  We slowly have the same fucking rules we initially hated.  Taxation laws and their persecution of religion.  Right.  So everyone comes over here to get taxed up the ass.  Right.  And, you know, the religion thing...  It's still better over here. 
[00:39:30]  It's better, but...  But we're moving closer and closer to what we left.  Yeah.  It just...  It's...  I don't think there's anything deeper going on down there.  This is the most shallow pool of fucking scum that I've seen collected in one place.  Redistribution of wealth.  Well, the numbers are growing in all these cities.  Well, as soon as New York cleans up...  Yeah.  As soon as New York cleans up...  That's the head of it. 
[00:40:00]  That's the snake head right there.  When they clean it up, though, it's going to be ugly.  Mark my word.  We'll see.  It's up to them.  There's no way these people leave peacefully.  It's up to the fucking protesters.  There's no fucking way.  Whether they want to get their heads bashed in or fucking not.  And there's probably people down there...  Probably.  No, I know.  Just by looking at them that have nothing to lose.  So they'll be a fucking martyr.  Then they'll be in Rikers.  Yeah.  Fuck them.  They'll find a way to do it.  I mean, I guess the NYPD...  What do you think?  It'll be just a tremendous show of force.  NYPD is great at things like crowd control.  They're not fucking, you know, some backwards fucking police force. 
[00:40:30]  They know this shit.  They know how to deal with these fucking crowds when they really have to.  But these are harder crowds to do.  Do you know what these crowds remind me of?  Hecklers that are joking with you and think they're helping the show.  Because they're a distraction and you want to smash their faces.  Yeah.  But if you hit them too hard, they don't look that threatening to the audience.  You'll lose...  They're really hard to deal with.  These people aren't being violent.  They're not breaking windows.  They're not flipping cars.  They're not setting fires.  It's harder to deal with. 
[00:41:00]  They're getting violent in Oakland.  In Oakland they are.  Oh yeah, they're breaking windows and shit there.  They're dealing with them harsher too.  They're fucking tear gassing them.  Oakland is the number one Occupy right now.  Tax the rich 90%.  Really?  That guy is...  He's right.  Where's your job then, fucko?  He's right.  The black guy from one of my videos...  Robin Williams from the...  And the Robin Williams character, those two are regulars.  I see them all the fucking time.  But in general, the people I filmed are long fucking gone.  Long fucking gone.  But that black guy, he's starting to look like he's kind of security. 
[00:41:30]  He does sort of walk around taking a look at things with a couple other guys.  So I've been studying them, wondering if that's their job or they're just taking it upon themselves to kind of police a little bit.  I don't know.  90%.  I'm glad that guy's trying to reprimand me in Congress.  That guy, that lunatic with the pink fucking mohawk, he's long gone.  Is he?  Yeah, man.  These guys, that's why...  Yeah.  What about this fucking idiot that's just...  I haven't seen him since...  Meditating. 
[00:42:00]  Haven't seen the guy that I fucked up his meditation.  But you'll see some of them, like the second, third time you're down there, you've seen like regulars and then all...  Only that black guy and the Papa Smurf guy, if you know my videos and...  It's scarier now?  And that is it.  Yes.  Yeah, absolutely.  Those are the only two that I've seen on a regular basis.  The rest I've never seen again.  Like the cute bear girl.  Yeah.  I haven't seen her since.  What about ketchup?  What?  The redhead girl, ketchup, that was on Colbert Report. 
[00:42:30]  She had the retard bangs and the big red glasses, they call her ketchup.  Like this weirdo with the Fox fucking cardboard camera and microphone.  I haven't seen him again either.  Hair lip, hair lip!  But why wouldn't you go, look, dummy, take your stupid Fox News cardboard camera and beat it.  This is not helping the cause.  Scramski.  And your lip is fucking enraging.  His fucking lip.  I've never seen less kissable lips.  And he whistled when he talked because he just couldn't keep the air in. 
[00:43:00]  Oh, the air doesn't know what the fuck to do to leave in his canyon mouth.  That guy's long gone.  Because I'm being reminded of these guys.  This is early on, too.  This video was very early on.  Yeah, but if you're occupying...  You know what, though?  If you go in the middle, people that are...  Those are the same people.  Oh, really?  Oh, yeah.  But they're not willing to talk or do anything.  No?  No.  They just sit there?  Yeah, that's the weird thing.  The people that are willing to talk are...  The People's Library! 
[00:43:30]  ...are making this whole movement look silly.  And the ones that are really entrenched and hanging out day after day,  they're not willing to talk or do anything.  Yeah, exactly.  That's why I got questions.  It's a strange fucking society down there.  I think you could just about chalk it up to these people are lost, confused,  disillusioned, and delusional.  And, yeah, they're just going to hang out with no real focus. 
[00:44:00]  You know who we should talk to?  And I have been paying attention, and thank you to...  I can't say your Twitter name because it's just stupid.  Hukie83 or something?  Good luck finding Hukie83 on Twitter.  He says we should talk to Rogan.  Really?  Because Rogan, I believe, is all for this.  Oh, he probably is.  And he probably knows...  No, he definitely knows way more than we do.  Can we book Rogan for a quick phone-er maybe later this morning?  Rogan's probably got a little bit of a left-leaning fucking tear on this thing. 
[00:44:30]  I know Rogan isn't like a lefty, that's for sure, but...  But I think he's very left-leaning when it comes to that type of stuff.  I bet with this kind of stuff, yeah, because he sees this as just probably a pure First Amendment issue.  But he probably has some facts that we don't have.  Yeah, I'm sure.  Whether we agree or disagree, let's hear his fucking angle.  This isn't just a First Amendment issue.  Did someone put the word out to Rogan?  Maybe he's still up, I don't know.  We'd love to have him on for a few minutes today.  Thank you.  What is it, Joe Rogan on Twitter, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, please.  I think he fancies himself... 
[00:45:00]  We'd love to talk to Joe.  People are saying he's a liberal, but I think he fancies himself more libertarian than liberal.  I think he's probably for the death penalty or for things...  I don't think...  I think he's probably for guns, too.  I don't think he's a fucking...  He's a less government guy.  He's a fucking...  He actually believes in all the amendments.  Oh, Denver Post is all after my shit again today.  Oh, oh, man.  What amendments does he say you don't believe in?  I don't know.  What amendment don't I believe in?  And if you fucking mention any of them, I'll exercise my second. 
[00:45:30]  There's a couple of...  Yeah, but that's just because you can't exercise your second because he's exercising his first.  Aw, shit.  Swim walk.  God damn, that was good, Jimmy.  Really good.  Of course.  No, I just think it's silly.  When I talk about this subject and I bring up that it's very shallow, it's very stupid,  it's not a freedom of speech issue, it's a fucking quality of life issue, this is exercising  one of your freedoms to the detriment of other people's freedoms.  Yeah.  And that's what happens. 
[00:46:00]  I love going down there, man.  I love studying people in general.  It's fucking fascinating.  It really is.  Yeah.  It's really fascinating.  Wall Street, and then you see the Pentagon.  It's like, what?  It's a mishmash of stupidity.  God, I mean, there's certain things I could agree with, of course.  But when it's just a parade of what the fuck is this going by you when they all walk by  with the signs, I don't know, what the fuck? 
[00:46:30]  That stupid band down there did a free show and had things thrown at them.  What band?  Burning Embers.  Oh.  Fuck, you got me.  Ah, you asshole.  Ah, your acting's getting good, man.  Ah, Jimmy.  Ah, you got me.  Hey, we should play this, because San Francisco is Occupy.  Wow.  Occupy San Francisco.  Yes.  They got a nice idea.  You want to hear it?  Ah, yeah.  Okay.  This is going to drive you nuts.  Oh, boy. 
[00:47:00]  Are you ready?  How's your blood pressure?  You all right?  Yeah, I'm good.  Okay.  Wait till you hear this one.  I have also been moved by this movement.  I have also been moved by this.  I love mic checks.  They're doing the repeat thing.  It's a mic check.  They're not allowed to have amplification devices without the proper permits, so what  they do is this one person talks, and then the rest of the people repeat it, and it gets  out over the entire crowd.  Use the terminology.  It's a mic check.  Mic check.  Because they start with, mic check. 
[00:47:30]  This is the one chance that we have.  This is the one chance that we have.  To actually enact change.  To actually enact change.  We must seize this opportunity.  We must seize this opportunity.  And not let it go by.  And not let it go by.  Why am I repeating this?  We need democracy in this country.  We need democracy in this country.  Right.  And not a democracy that is run by politicians. 
[00:48:00]  What?  And not a democracy that is run by politicians.  All right.  I'll hold the phone.  Who runs a democracy?  They will.  They just want to do this.  Yeah?  That's the problem with a lot of stuff.  They just want to be.  They don't want a representative government?  They just want to be the guys in charge.  They don't want a representative government?  They just want to be the guys in charge.  But then.  And she's probably 20.  Yeah.  Remember what you were doing at 20.  Occupy her fucking pussy.  Yeah.  With my cock and fist.  Maybe a piece of pussy.  Maybe the Indy 500.  With my mushroom head.  That are bought by corporations. 
[00:48:30]  That are bought by corporations.  We need a democracy in this country.  We need a democracy in this country.  Where the people have the right to print money.  Where the people have the right to print money.  To print money?  Not a nebulous federal reserve.  Not a nebulous federal reserve.  So they want to print their own money.  All right.  And then she could go in with her shitty money to a store.  Right?  And try to buy something. 
[00:49:00]  And the guy will say.  No.  You need a billion of those.  In order to buy this pair of pants.  Now if you have the American dollar.  For 25 or 30 of those.  I'll give it to you.  You can make your own money.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  Take it into a store.  And try to spend it.  And if the store owner wants to take it.  Well that's his prerogative.  Get beaver pelts.  Shake your pubes and make beaver pelts.  What would you call your money?  What would you call your money?  Deutschmark.  Bring that back.  You want to call mine? 
[00:49:30]  What?  Sheck nurkers.  422,000 Sheck nurkers.  For that hat please.  Sheck nurkers.  What an asshole.  Can you break a Sheck nurker?  What does it break down to?  Yeah.  What's the dollar to Sheck?  Well no.  47 flunks.  You just spit egg all over her hand.  No he missed.  So it's a flunks.  47 flunks.  47 flunks.  Make one what? 
[00:50:00]  Sheck nurker.  So a flunks is like a petty?  No it's flunks.  Imagine 47 you have to count out.  It's the whole system sucks.  But with  Just a horrible number.  With one flunks you can buy a Mercedes.  Not many people have a lot of flunks.  You're an ass.  Oh god.  Just two things to mention.  One the FCC.  Aha. 
[00:50:30]  And two.  Lists always make me angry.  Oh.  Always.  Why don't we tease the people with both those things.  I never agree.  With lists?  Never.  The list that they showed us bothered me so much I had to crumble up and throw it away.  Really?  Well can we do the list?  Top 40 comedy albums of all.  Spin Magazine.  Yo.  Edgy.  Top 40.  Occupy Wall Street has got to eat.  Get it?  See what I did there? 
[00:51:00]  It's a.  Yeah I see.  It's a.  That was pretty good.  Oh.  Where's the list?  Spin Magazine.  Do we have it?  Oh Jimmy loves these lists.  Especially from Spin because those guys are edgy.  That's a guy's magazine.  Top 10 metal bands of all time.  No that one didn't.  I didn't agree with it but it didn't annoy me.  What?  This doesn't annoy you?  No.  I mean number two does but number one does.  Number three of course.  Wow is Joe DeRosa going to be happy today?  Isn't that his band?  I don't have the list.  Dream Theater?  I don't agree with that. 
[00:51:30]  I think that's kind of a stupid one to put number two but.  40 greatest comedy albums of all time.  That.  Literally.  That hurt me in my stomach.  Let me look at the top 10 quickly.  I'm not even going to look at the list.  Oh boy.  I'm not even going to look.  Oh no.  Oh no.  I watched Blow last night.  Wait, wait, wait.  Last movie.  What?  What?  Wait, wait.  What?  I know you're just going over the list so I figured I would just throw in that.  No, no, no.  No, I'm wondering why the list bothers Jimmy. 
[00:52:00]  The top 10 isn't that bad is it?  Can I see the list?  Thanks, I threw mine out.  I'm not going to look at it.  You want to do it after the break?  Yes.  Quickly?  I'm hungry.  That's a guy's magazine.  All right.  I want to see why you're bothered bothered by it.  What are you guys doing?  Reading spin.  I've never heard that before.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  It's radio.  Wildly funny.  Wildly funny.  What happened?  How do you mind?  Wildly funny.  Ah.  It's radio. 
[00:52:30]  Wildly funny.  Wildly funny.  This is the most energy I've had at 7 in the morning.  Wildly funny.  Wow.  Wow.  Oh, jeez.  I've never been in a room this funny.  Wildly funny.  Wildly funny.  What happened?  Have you mind?  No.  No.  Oh, jeez.  Oh, jeez.  It's radio.  Ah.  Ah.  Have you ever been to the zoo?  Because that's also entertaining.  Wildly funny.  Ah.  Wow.  Wow.  I've never been in a room this funny.  Wow.  No. 
[00:53:00]  It's radio.  Wildly funny.  Radio.  Wow.  Wow.  Wildly funny.  Radio.  Clap at the f*** of your mind.  Oh, jeez.  Oh, jeez.  Oh, jeez.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Get ready, America.  Today's hottest impressionist is coming to a theater near you.  Jim Norton.  Man of a thousand voices.  Live.  In concert.  All your favorite celebrities are here.  Bill Clinton.  I did not have sex with that woman.  I did not have sex with that woman.  I did not have sex with that woman. 
[00:53:30]  Samuel L. Jackson.  That girl got snakes near a plane.  Sylvester Stallone.  Hey.  I'm going to have to get a lot of body bags if that girl's coming to town.  And Christopher Walken.  Oh, I carried this iPhone in my butt.  Jim Norton.  Man of a thousand voices.  Live in concert.  Coming to a theater near you.  Sheriff. 
[00:54:00]  It looks like we found another body.  This is the third one this week.  I think it's about time we call in the FBI.  Somewhere out there, a killer is on the loose.  Why, yes, Sheriff.  I have been following that story in the papers.  It used to be such a peaceful little town.  And there's only one man who can catch him.  Now, don't you worry.  I'm going to send my best man down there to help you in your investigation.  But he was busy.  Here comes fucking ferret face. 
[00:54:30]  Whatever.  All right, Agent Voss.  Someone's out there murdering innocent women.  I want you to go down there and assist the local sheriff.  You're one of the bad.  Get down there and help the sheriff.  How could he be a profiler?  His vocabulary is so bad.  Yeah, but no one listens.  This summer, the Opie and Anthony Show presents a comedy about an idiotic comedian pretending to be an FBI agent.  So you work a lot of murders before?  Now we're doing mainly a lot on terrorists and terrorist-type threats and stuff like that. 
[00:55:00]  But, you know, back in the day, it was more murder.  What are some of the cases you worked on?  Just, you know, Seattle, the Green River.  What do you call it?  Look, I can't talk a lot about it.  I don't get this much in detail.  Starring Jim Norton.  He just keeps saying profile, profilers, other profilers, profilers.  And Rich Voss.  Great minds think a lot.  I'm like, oh my God.  The Profiler.  Coming to a theater nowhere near you or anyone else.  Thank baby Jesus. 
[00:55:30]  Celebrity friends of Jim Norton.  Celebrity friends of Little Jimmy.  Celebrity friends of Jim Norton.  Celebrity friends of Little Jimmy.  On today's show, Tyra Banks.  Um, I like trannies.  Oh my God!  I like trannies too!  Celebrity friends of Jim Norton.  Celebrity friends of Little Jimmy.  Sirius XM.  You're listening to O.B. Anthony. 
[00:56:00]  Jimmy was telling me on the way to the bathroom that the comedy list ruined his morning.  It wrecked.  Before, can I plug Stress Factory tonight?  Because the only press I'm doing is this show.  What?  You got people now, Jimmy.  What's wrong with you?  Nobody did a fucking thing.  So I'll be there tonight, tomorrow.  They just assume too much.  They just, nobody did a fucking thing to get me.  And I mean, maybe some of the press passed.  They're not all going to want to interview me. 
[00:56:30]  But literally nothing.  Thank you to the podcast that had me on yesterday.  Right.  But nothing.  You should be doing local TV.  Or anything.  At the very least.  Or at least a newspaper.  At least something.  Something.  Nothing.  Nothing.  Nothing.  Jesus H. Christ.  Nothing.  Tonight's tomorrow, Saturday.  Stress Factory.  Love that club.  Love that club.  I do too.  It's a great place to watch comedy.  And I have to say, the pre-sale's over, I believe, for the Borgata January 14th.  But we're over-doubled where we were last year at this time on the pre-sale ticket.  So general sale goes on tomorrow morning, and it will sell out, I think, 10 a.m. for January 
[00:57:00]  14th with me, Artie, Doug, Stanhope, and Dave.  You think we'll get Artie on the show?  I don't know if he's allowed to do serious stuff.  I actually have to ask him.  I'm interested if he can do stuff.  Because I haven't heard him on the platform at all.  Right.  And I haven't heard plans to have him on the platform.  So I don't know.  I would love to talk to Artie, yeah.  He's doing well.  We all know the same people, obviously.  Spin Magazine's 40 greatest comedy albums of all time.  This list has ruined Jim Norton's morning.  And I shouldn't look at lists. 
[00:57:30]  They're not important.  They're just opinions.  I got a couple problems, too.  But go ahead, Jimmy.  This is your thing.  A lot of them I don't know enough.  I can't complain about it.  I think Dice, the top 40.  Where's my list?  I don't know.  You probably just put it.  You gave it to Jimmy, remember?  I'm under mind comfort.  You know, someone else gave it.  Oh, here it is.  You have a list.  What did you do with your list?  I'll be the guy that doesn't know.  I'm the guy that doesn't know him.  So I can guess.  I'm not going to read the whole list. 
[00:58:00]  But I'll say this.  Number 40.  Dice.  Day the Laughter Died.  You know, it's an album I've never heard.  And you guys always talk about it.  You and Florentine especially.  Love that fucking thing.  It's, I really think, Chris Rock said that one time when we were at the comedy table at  the cellar talking.  I forget how it came up, but he said that is one of the greatest comedy.  And, you know, I just, it's just an opinion.  But comedians look at that album like it's just a masterpiece.  Why?  Because it's funny, in a very silly different than Dice, like, he was a guy who was doing 
[00:58:30]  the garden, and he walked into Dangerfields.  It was not his audience.  They were not expecting him.  He did three nights and bombed.  But it's not too hip for the room bombing.  It's just Dice talking shit, nonsense, ludicrous shit.  And it's a double, he released it as a fucking double album.  So comedians like this?  Love.  Yeah, it's a comedian's comedian album. 
[00:59:00]  But the balls of it, and it's funny.  It's not not funny.  And he made it when he was selling out arenas all over the place.  Dude, it's almost like he didn't want to just go in and get laughs.  He went in and just did nothing.  He wouldn't do nursery rhymes.  It was such a ballsy move for a fucking comedian.  And it's funny.  So I don't think it should have been number 40.  I think it should have been much higher on the list.  I wouldn't have put it in the top 10, but it should be on the list.  Okay.  But I'm just going to go to the top 10.  Well, could you talk about Sam Kinison for a second?  Louder Than Hell is 31. 
[00:59:30]  Yeah.  Really?  I would have put that...  Kinison should be way higher.  I think I would have put that higher too.  Because these dopes at Spin Magazine, I hate when they do this.  Like you said earlier, they have to pick one album by one comic.  This one or that one.  Some of these guys had three or four brilliant albums.  So why not more than one?  That's true.  But Kinison in 31st place is ridiculous.  Like I don't know a lot of these albums.  I really don't.  I've never heard most of them. 
[01:00:00]  Before you go to the top 10, there's another one, Jimmy.  I'm sorry.  Sure.  Chris Rock.  Now, Chris Rock had an album, Bring the Pain, which I told you guys, I wore out my copy.  That was hilarious.  That was an amazing album.  Yep.  Talking about the N-word.  It was...  The N-word went mainstream.  That was a very funny fucking bit that he would do.  Well, they didn't put that album on the list of 40 greatest comedy albums of all time.  That's ridiculous.  Not only should Bring the Pain by Chris Rock be on the list, it should be probably top 10, 
[01:00:30]  in my opinion.  They picked Bigger and Blacker by Chris Rock.  That album, it's okay, but Bring the Pain was a much better fucking comedy album.  Not even close.  Yeah, that one, I don't even remember the one they had on there.  Bigger and Blacker?  It was like, eh.  I think it was the follow-up to Bring the Pain, and I was disappointed in it.  There was an absolute drop-off.  After fucking the last one, though, it's impossible to come out with an album that's just as good 
[01:01:00]  or better.  Yeah.  So, go ahead, Jimmy.  Sorry.  Our pal Louis C.K.  Chewed Up is in the 19th place.  I've never heard Chewed Up.  Everyone says it's a fucking masterpiece.  It's really good.  And so I have no issue with that.  And again, I can't say just because a lot of times we tend to look at older stuff as  better, like back in the moment.  And I can't say just because these guys are my contemporaries that they don't belong on  the list.  So maybe they do belong on the list. 
[01:01:30]  Well, Weird Al Yankovic is better than Dice, better than Chris Rock, better than Louis C.K.,  better than Red Fox, better than Kinnison, just to name a few.  Robin Williams, Weird Al Yankovic, 17th place with an album called In 3D.  In all fairness, I've never heard the fucking thing.  I have not either.  I can only imagine this goofy, stupid shit.  Is that the one with all the hits?  I have no idea.  What's on there?  Beat it?  But it's a totally stupid list.  Is Eat It on there? 
[01:02:00]  Yeah, this was like his first mainstream album.  This had Eat It on it.  Fine.  I'm sure if Eric was here, he'd be able to talk about it better than I can.  And then he certainly has had success, but I mean, they're saying his album was better  than Chris Rock's Bring the Pain, which is not even on the list.  That's stupid.  Yeah.  This is why I hate fake edge stuff like spin, like in fake guy stuff.  Right.  The top of his album was his big album.  Yes.  Oh, fuck yeah.  You know Relent.  Definitely too.  Yeah.  That was a good one.  I love all his stuff, but you know. 
[01:02:30]  Rant in E minor?  Well.  Mm-hmm.  All right, Jimmy.  I'll finally shut down.  Please jump in.  It's a discussion.  Listen, my problem with it wasn't, like again, David Cross is number 12, and Patton  is number five.  They're guys I know, so it's harder to look at them the way I would look at a guy who  came before me.  But I would have put Woody Allen's number 10 stand-up comic, and it's just, to have put 
[01:03:00]  so many records above that, I don't get.  That, to me, is one of the greatest comedy albums of all time, and it's just, it's better  than Steve Martin.  It's better than Lenny Bruce.  The number one, I'll just go number one.  Bill Cosby, To Russell, My Brother, Whom I Slept With.  Now, I don't know that record.  I'm sure I've heard bits of it.  I remember from fucking mega years ago.  Ooh, that's an old one.  Was that his?  It's one of them, as a kid, you'd sit around, listen to him, and be like, eh, ha, ha, laughing.  But once he got older, it was just, why listen to that when Pryor was around and Carlin? 
[01:03:30]  Well, Pryor, they gave number two, and this is what wrecked my morning.  Richard Pryor, Live on the Sunset Strip, is exactly what Spin Magazine would put, so  they don't have to write the word nigger.  That's all it, because that's, the records, Wanted was the concert from Live in Concert,  which Wanted was a masterpiece, too.  Bicentennial nigger and That Nigger's Crazy are two of the fucking most amazing comedy 
[01:04:00]  performances, and both are better than Sunset Strip, by far.  By far.  But I know why they did that, and that's what bothers me.  It's not just an opinion.  Like, Cosby could go, well, this album or that album.  They didn't want to put that word on their fucking magazine, on their fucking list, so  they went with Live on the Sunset Strip, which to me is, it's not a hacked performance,  but people who don't know Pryor would say that.  It's safe.  And it fucking annoyed me so much, because it's not above those records at all. 
[01:04:30]  I think you're accurate with that.  Eddie Murphy in third place with Comedian, George Carlin, Class Clown, fourth.  I can live with that.  There's a lot of Carlin stuff I prefer, but I can see that.  Patton Oswalt, Werewolves and Lollipops, fifth.  I wouldn't have put Patton above.  I've never heard of that one.  Above, I haven't heard it either, but I wouldn't have put him above Woody or a lot of  these guys.  Bob Newhart, The Button-Down Mind of Bob Newhart.  Bob Newhart's comedy albums are fucking hilarious. 
[01:05:00]  I think he had the two number one albums in the country.  Yeah.  Yeah, never been done, right?  Comedy, both comedy, and number one and two at the same time, which was unheard of.  Steve Martin, Let's Get Small in seventh place.  Is that the whole King Tut thing?  Which album is that?  Nah, I think that's, that might have been before King Tut.  Probably before.  I think that was Wild and Crazy Guy.  Balloons on his head, instead of the arrow through his head.  Fuck, man.  I used to know all these albums and what was on them.  What was on that album?  Does, you know, offhand?  Does it say real faster, Sambo? 
[01:05:30]  Post-Vietnam generalization, generation bellowing the catchphrase, well, excuse me.  Oh, that was excuse me.  Yeah, that's funnier, that's funnier than that nigger's crazy.  That's right, with the balloons and stuff.  Crazy, right?  And he'd go, happy feet, and he'd start dancing around.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's a lot funnier than Wino and the Junkie.  Much better. 
[01:06:00]  Lenny Bruce, the Carnegie Hall concert in eighth.  Albert Brooks, comedy minus one.  And then, like you said, Woody Allen in tenth, stand-up comic.  Like, yeah, it's a nonsense list.  That's what bothered me so much, I know why they did that.  And it's just like, ugh.  I opened my eyes to that one.  I agree with you.  But my thoughts were, Sam Kinison, you gotta move up.  Chris Rock, they picked the wrong fucking album.  And they picked the wrong fucking album on Bill Hicks.  Like, if they would have put Wanted, I could have lived with that. 
[01:06:30]  Because it's like, all right, that was where Live in Concert came from.  It's the same tour.  Really good question.  Why aren't there any Cheech and Chong albums on the list?  Cheech and Chong were fucking huge in the comedy.  About Weird Al Yankovic, yeah.  Are they doing albums that sold a motherfucker?  Or are they doing albums that were good comedy albums?  I don't know their criteria.  Well, you know what?  That's a good question.  I don't know their criteria.  No, it couldn't be sold.  Because if it was sold, Dice wouldn't be number 40.  And Kinison sold a shitload of copies, and so did fucking Chris Rock, man. 
[01:07:00]  So I guess they're saying Cheech and Chong is kind of like, you know.  In honor of our November 2011 Funny Issue, we assembled a crack team of comedy nerds.  The Funny Issue.  To compile.  Timmy Warren, why aren't you part of the Funny Issue?  Yeah.  Why would I ever be with one of these magazines?  Ever.  Ever.  But you know the funny.  But I don't believe, I'm not saying that my CDs belong to this list by any stretch.  But I just don't agree with what they put.  Yeah, it's the 40 best comedy albums of all time. 
[01:07:30]  And they phrased it, here's, it should be here are, but here is, 40 artists who deserve  to sell more units than Jeff Foxworthy.  So maybe they were doing, they had to do different.  More than Foxworthy, I guess.  Because Jeff Foxworthy's not cool.  Yeah, he's not cool.  Oh, that's right.  Spin is hip.  That's right.  Foxworthy's shitty because he's like, what, you might be a redneck.  You know what?  Yeah, he's corny, spins hip.  I'll fucking admit it, the Foxworthy stuff made me howl.  The problem was he just kept with the same concept forever. 
[01:08:00]  This fucking, but I mean, his shit is way funnier than a bunch of these albums.  These corny fucking pseudo-mavericks thinking they're dangerous by making fun of the blue  collar, yeah, he's terrible.  You know what, Jimmy?  Going back to Chris Rock, because what you said about Richard Pryor, the N-word is the  biggest, I'm such a faggot for not saying that.  Nigger, there you go, if you need to hear me say it, too.  But Chris Rock, that's the big bit on the Bring the Pain.  Right.  So they probably had a problem with that as well. 
[01:08:30]  Because that's half the fucking album.  He kept going back to that.  Yeah.  He kept going back to that.  It's a legendary bit.  It's a very famous bit.  Legendary.  So they decide, ah, let's not do Bring the Pain.  Let's go with Bigger and Blacker.  That's just dumb.  And Live on the Sunset Strip, it was actually really a moving part, but this is where Pryor swore  off that word.  When he said that he went to Africa and he wouldn't say that anymore, because he had,  it wasn't a social thing.  He was allowed to say it whenever he wanted.  But it was a fucking, an epiphany he had, if that's the word, when he was in Africa.  He just didn't want to say it anymore. 
[01:09:00]  And that was a great moment in that special.  But that special was after his fire.  It was the 81.  And that wasn't as good as the ones from earlier.  I don't think that was...  I want to thank Tim D. in Massapequa Park.  Abso-fucking-lutely.  Brian Regan.  That first album of his?  Holy shit.  Well, they probably don't think it's hip.  Right.  That's what I...  Holy shit.  That's hip.  It's one of my favorite comedy albums of all time.  That first one.  Yeah, Jeff Foxworthy's... 
[01:09:30]  Yeah.  But don't get...  Get rid of him.  He shouldn't sell units.  Why?  Hip, Spin Magazine.  Look at that.  Yeah.  Why shouldn't he sell units?  Meanwhile, they're not hip enough to put in the real albums because they're afraid of  the name on the cover.  Exactly.  Fucking corn balls.  Or, I'll say it again, bits that are on the album.  Yeah.  That's why they didn't go with that Chris Rock album.  And I'm positive now, after what Jimmy's saying.  Fucking drives me nuts.  And then it's like, you know what?  Even if you're not a huge fan of Larry, the cable guy.  Larry. 
[01:10:00]  The guy sells out arenas.  You can't say he stinks.  Yeah.  He doesn't stink.  At all.  No.  Oh, Midwest loves him.  Yeah, a lot of the rest of the country, too.  Someone's telling me they wrote,  End Person vs. Black People was on Bigger and Blacker.  No, it wasn't.  No.  Stop it.  It was...  No.  No.  Bring the Pain.  I do not know.  I know the bit, but I don't know which.  It was Bring the Pain.  Bring the Pain.  Has to be.  I'm going to feel like a fucking douchebag. 
[01:10:30]  Why?  If you just thought it was on the other bit?  I made a stand on this whole thing.  It's all right.  I'm going with Bring the Pain.  It's on Bring the Pain.  Better stand on your...  Bring the Pain.  It's not on Bigger and Blacker.  Bring the Pain.  Bigger and Blacker had the champagne room and all that shit.  Yeah.  Right?  Or was the Apollo.  I think Bigger and Blacker was done with the Apollo.  No, there's no champagne in the champagne room.  Mm-hmm.  Let's bring the pain.  Where is it?  Come on.  Pop it up.  Where are the tracks?  Yeah.  All right.  Jesus Christ.  Let's bring the pain.  Stop breathing for a second. 
[01:11:00]  Block him.  Block him.  I really did.  Block him.  Yeah.  All right.  He meant well.  Fair enough.  Nah, I'll let him slide.  Fuck it.  Who gives a fuck in the end?  Who gives a fuck who hates you and who doesn't?  It doesn't fucking matter.  Uh, we move on to the next list.  Get rid of those Jeff Fox where they shouldn't sell units.  What do you mean, wait?  Tip is...  This has been his hip.  What?  It says Bring the Pain was not an album.  It was just the TV special.  It was the special.  Right.  So...  What was the album?  It wasn't...  Oh, you know what, though? 
[01:11:30]  Now I'm completely confused.  I'll tell you what it might be.  Eddie Murphy, Comedian, I believe is the record for Delirious.  Like, Wanted is the record, Pryor's record for Richard Pryor's film live in concert from  Long Beach.  So I wonder if that's what Murphy's...  Chris Rock put out a CD in 1997 called Roll With The New.  Bring the Pain was from 1996.  That track is on Roll With The New.  Oh, yeah.  Roll With The New.  Ah.  Yeah, okay.  That's the album, obviously. 
[01:12:00]  That's the one that wore out.  But it's from...  Roll With The New.  I'm sorry.  Yeah.  Yeah, okay.  I get it.  But it's from Bring the Pain.  Wait, was Bring the Pain the special?  You might have been right, dude.  Uh, I don't know.  Yeah, Bring the Pain is the special.  Bring the Pain is the special.  Yes, yes, yes.  So you were right.  It was on the special.  You assumed that the record was called the same thing.  But I had that fucking Roll With The New in my car forever.  That Chris Rock album was amazing.  Right.  Way better than Bigger and Blacker.  Okay.  Oh, so that's what they did?  Why wouldn't they name the fucking album after the special?  I don't know why they do that. 
[01:12:30]  That's confusing.  I don't know why.  The album came out first, so maybe they...  Oh, no, it didn't.  No, no, no.  The album came out later, so you'd think they would name it after the special.  Unless HBO owned the copyright.  Maybe there's differences.  It might be copyright stuff, too.  Or it might be a different show.  Like, because if HBO films something, you can't just release it as a CD as your own.  You could tape something else from that tour.  Mm-hmm.  Okay, because nowadays, they just name it the same fucking thing.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  Okay. 
[01:13:00]  Rolling Stone readers poll the top ten metal bands of all time.  Jimmy knows metal way more than I fucking do.  You like the list?  I mean, it's not the exact list I would have put together, but even the stuff I disagree  with, it's like, ah, there's one that...  Number two, it's just like, again, it's Rolling Stone.  They gotta be too hip for the room.  This fucking Dream Theater shit.  They might belong on the list, but not...  Joe DeRosa loves Dream Theater, and I just never got Dream Theater. 
[01:13:30]  Did you get Dream Theater in?  No.  A little too cerebral.  A couple songs I kind of liked, because I had to play them on the radio back in the  day, but I don't understand.  Number one, they gave...  As far as a catalog of music.  They gave Metallica, number one.  I can live with that.  My personal choice would have been Sabbath, but they're Metallica, that's fine.  Number two, Dream Theater.  Number three, Sabbath.  Number four, Maiden.  Five, Slayer.  Six, Megadeth.  Seven, Judas Priest.  Eight, Led Zeppelin, which I completely disagree with. 
[01:14:00]  Nine, Pantera, and ten, Tool.  So I could, except for Dream Theater and Zeppelin, because Zeppelin wasn't metal.  I, uh, you know, whatever.  They were pseudo-metal.  Yeah, more like classic.  In some people's categories.  Yeah, yeah.  With the blues influence, obviously.  They just wanted to put Zeppelin on the list.  That's just what they do.  Well, then, if you're going to put Zeppelin on the list, then, I mean, knock it off.  Then you move it way the fuck up the list.  Obviously.  But if they want to do metal...  Can't argue about their success.  If they want to do metal, that's why Rolling Stone, once again, showing that they're just,  they're really out of touch to put... 
[01:14:30]  Well, they're saying this is a reader's poll, though.  Well, again, they're listening.  Their fucking readers are out of touch.  Yeah.  I love Tool.  Yeah.  They're popular.  I'm not into them, but I mean, I understand why they're there.  Tool over Dream Theater any fucking day of the week.  Can we hear Dream Theater?  Oh, and, uh...  What song would you like?  Dream Theater tweeted this poll to their fans.  Yeah, I figured it was.  Which helps explain why they...  Oh, okay.  Yeah, because Dream Theater, they got extremely loyal fans.  Okay, that's something I...  They could get some things done. 
[01:15:00]  You don't think Ozzy and fucking Tony were tweeting to their fans to vote for them?  Nah.  Of course not.  It's a live version of...  Oh, pull me under?  Pull me under.  Oh, Christ.  Is it good or awful?  I had to play this a million fucking times.  I don't know it.  Why are we doing it in the live version?  Just what's up?  I thought live...  Live E-Rock was here.  He was a play to live tracks, right?  Oh, Travis does stuff. 
[01:15:30]  Jeff Tate, right?  He's a lead singer.  How about Ramstein?  Not that it matters.  Ramstein.  Put them on the list.  Like the Ramstein.  Wish Florentine was here.  These guys know how to play their instruments.  That's for sure.  So does Yes.  Exactly.  So does Ross.  I don't mind Yes, though.  Oh, there he is.  I don't know.  I can't do this a little bit.  Yeah, it's okay.  Yeah.  I feel like it's a heavy part.  It's metal.  It doesn't sound like metal, though. 
[01:16:00]  No.  Travis is going to play it from the...  Okay.  That means we've got to get the whole intro again.  No.  No.  This world is spinning around me.  This world is spinning without me.  And every day since you've tried to pass.  Everywhere leaves me one last to my last.  It's good. 
[01:16:30]  That gets a little weird.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I kind of like the heavier part of it than this.  It's kind of wimpy sounding.  What the fuck did Jeff Tate could sing his balls off?  I would have to admit that, but I never got into it. 
[01:17:00]  Yeah.  Jimmy, Sal in Tampa.  Don Rickles.  Hello, Dummy.  Why isn't there a Don Rickles album on that comedy list?  Didn't even think of it.  They don't want to make fun of the retards.  Probably.  He was fucking brilliant with his shit.  Yes, he was.  How about Joan Rivers?  Maybe she didn't have a lot of albums.  Maybe it was all live.  I don't know her records that much.  Lamb of Gawd.  What about Lamb of Gawd?  Oh, Tate is...  I'm an asshole.  I get everything wrong.  I love it.  Jeff Tate is Queensryche.  That's right. 
[01:17:30]  Oh.  Sorry.  Sorry.  We got fucking Dream Theater fans really mad.  Sorry.  I always get them confused.  Do you really?  Always.  Actually, back me up on this one.  Totally.  You thought it was Jeff Tate, right?  Yep.  Okay, good.  I'm fucking...  I don't know.  I'm really uncomfortable right now.  That's all right.  I didn't know the difference either.  It's James...  I don't even know how to say his last name.  Labrie is the singer?  All right.  Sorry.  Whoops.  They're killing me.  They're killing me.  They're good.  I don't know their stuff. 
[01:18:00]  You like Queensryche?  I like Silent Lucidity.  Nah, that was another one of these fucking over-the-top fucking...  Look how hard we're trying to make a power ballad-y sounding.  Yeah, I don't know.  Well, I know who belongs on this list and Zeppelin doesn't, but I guess people put...  Yeah, man.  Motorhead.  Motorhead.  Yeah, why isn't Motorhead on the list?  Because Lemmy sings like he's being strangled.  Love him.  Who is this? 
[01:18:30]  This is Queensryche.  Very breathy.  I'd rather listen to Pink Floyd.  Wow.  Yeah.  You expect it to break into...  There is no pain you are.  Yeah.  If you're so comfortable, how can you feel numb?  I used to yell at the radio and get big laughs.  You think you could sneak this into a Pink Floyd medley and most people wouldn't know?  Probably.  Especially if they're all fucked up. 
[01:19:00]  Just be sitting there, yeah, fucking Floyd!  Do you think this guy's influenced by Floyd right here?  Just a tad.  What's in that voice?  Sounds like it should be on the wall.  Wow.  By the way, same producer as Destroyer by Kiss.  Boring fact of the day.  What?  Bob Liseron.  No, no.  The wall.  Oh, no care.  That was a great interview yesterday.  With Ace Fraley.  Yeah, the Boneyard.  I don't know if it aired last night.  It's supposed to air last night or tonight. 
[01:19:30]  There is no pain you are receiving.  A distant ship look on the horizon.  Is it different?  It's close, man.  I hear it.  You are only coming through in waves.  Yeah.  Your lips move, but I can't hear what you're saying. 
[01:20:00]  Sounds like three or four different Floyd songs.  I know.  At the same time.  It's jammed together.  Do you know I was watching a live version of Comfortably Numb, and it's just a stupid  little distinction, but I loved it because you know how it's your lips move, but I can't  hear what you're saying.  Yeah.  I always thought it was, but I can't hear what you say.  Really?  And that ing, I don't know why it made a big difference when I watched it.  I just liked watching him sing that live.  Oh, he does do more of a little trill down with that word, too, than he does in the album  version.  Yeah.  But he says it live.  He goes, you're saying.  And I'm like, oh, I like that. 
[01:20:30]  Yeah.  Wow.  Yeah.  Have become.  Yes.  Oh, there are a complete fucking Floyd ripoff.  I don't think I'm.  Oh, my God.  I don't think I'm hitting on any new ground here.  I wish you were here and there.  Yeah.  That's a good song.  Got a bunch of fishes and stuff in a bowl.  No.  They forget everything.  Yeah.  Oh.  Jesus.  The time.  All right. 
[01:21:00]  Jesus.  Hear what you're saying.  Saying.  Now I got to hear that.  Saying.  Comfortably numb is fucking.  That's a great song.  Floyd never gets old.  Is it that live version or no?  I don't know.  Oh, there's one there.  It looks a little old right there.  That's a live thing they got together for.  Live eight.  Live eight.  Where was this?  Jeez.  It was in Australia.  Oh, jeez.  Man, imagine hearing that coming from the other guy. 
[01:21:30]  Fucking standing in the crowd and hearing that shit.  You ever go to a Floyd show?  It's got a rule.  I went to fucking The Wall back in the garden.  Never went.  Years ago.  Never seen Floyd live.  Me neither.  I'd love to.  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  This is the live, obviously.  Yeah.  Are they respected, you think, by other musicians?  Jesus.  Just a little bit.  What was it?  Dark Side of the Moon was on the fucking top 100 for... 
[01:22:00]  Forever.  For like 50 years, I don't know.  Yeah, forever.  More info about Jeff Tate.  Biggest influence is Peter Gabriel.  Rebecca knows everything about Jeff.  That's what he told her probably when it's coming in her hair.  But she loves the Floyd thing.  She thinks it's hilarious.  You do?  Yeah.  Of course.  Sounds good.  It is good, right?  Jesus.  Yeah, it's a lot more fit. 
[01:22:30]  I hope it sounds better.  You are only coming through in waves.  It's all smooth.  Your lips are smooth, but I can't hear what you're saying.  Yeah.  The drummer looks like a fucking engineer.  You know?  He looks like someone that would work here.  Oh, they got the colored singers, too.  Sounds just like the record.  Yeah, he sounds good, too. 
[01:23:00]  Sounds so good.  He looks like an older, chubbier me.  I've got a feeling once again.  I've got a feeling once again.  I've got a feeling once again.  I've got a feeling you will not understand.  This is not how I am.  The big, long note.  The big, long note.  Oh, that's good.  Fucking old codger can sing his song. 
[01:23:30]  Just fucking getting fucked up listening to this shit.  Yeah.  Where's my shrooms?  I used to have a joke.  I would always go,  I'm Floyd.  He's all in the pink paint or something.  They never did that, chubbier.  You never said that.  We don't laugh, though.  No one laughed.  Why does the drummer have too many things to hit?  Things.  I hate when drummers have too many things. 
[01:24:00]  You've got to have, like, a gong.  You've got to have fucking all kinds of symbols.  And the twinkly bells.  Yeah, way too many things.  Fuck.  That's a nice stage, though, man.  They've got, like, everybody.  They've got a lot of people on it,  but they're not all crowded on it.  How long ago was Live Aid?  Live Aid.  Anyone?  Who's that drummer look like?  You said an engineer, but he's...  He looks like an engineer.  Yeah.  He's the older Mr. Bean.  He's the older Mr. Bean.  Fucking sick.  Uh, 2008?  Okay.  Live Aid was 2005. 
[01:24:30]  2005, so the 8 makes no sense.  Yeah.  How many dislikes on this video?  Oh, yeah.  How many dislikes?  468.  What?  468 out of 14 and a half million views.  That's...  A lot of people liked this.  He does look like...  He's a weird-looking dude when he's singing like that.  All in the horizon.  Fuck, that's great.  Look, it just stopped the show.  I know.  Fucking Floyd will stop the show in its tracks. 
[01:25:00]  Showing some hippies from the audience.  Some aged hippies.  Some aged hippies.  He's dressed in a black t-shirt.  Yeah.  60s-looking, attractive black girl singing back up.  Mm-hmm.  He's got that 60s look.  Like she in the Shirelles or some shit. 
[01:25:30]  They found a nice colored.  Yeah, they did.  Where do you find your coloreds?  Popped up.  She sings very well.  You need them to sing your band.  What do you think she does when she's not, like, doing the Pink Floyd thing for them?  You think?  Yeah.  She's dancing.  Because she's not going to wait around for them to do more gigs.  No.  And now the big.  Yeah, the big solo.  Go.  Yeah, rock. 
[01:26:00]  Bring me some more weed.  Jesus.  There's a black t-shirt on stage.  That was just this.  Yeah, for an hour.  Yeah.  Wow, he does have a lot of drums.  He's got a lot of shit.  Damn.  How many people are they playing in front of?  It's got to be 30.  Oh, I thought it was like 30 or 40.  You're saying 500?  That's a lot.  By the way, how many times am I going to mention the black t-shirt thing?  We heard you.  Fucking redundant idiot. 
[01:26:30]  Damn, that's a lot of fucking people.  Yeah.  We were supposed to go on right after them.  That's why.  Burning Embers?  Yeah.  What does Burning Embers think about Pink Floyd?  We're burning.  We're burning.  We're burning like Embers.  Like Embers.  Like Embers.  Is that Burning Embers off of Burning Embers album?  Burning Embers?  Yeah.  Not the album yet.  Just the demo.  Oh, okay.  Oh, boy.  Rock in Florida, right?  I'm absolutely crying over here.  I was under the phone talk.  I'm absolutely crying.  I'm absolutely crying.  I mean, Pink Floyd. 
[01:27:00]  What can you say?  George Taylor Morris already had fucking cancer and he wasn't crying.  That's right.  Jesus, Bruce.  Get a hold of yourself.  Couldn't he?  Had cancer in the tear ducts.  We lost a great voice in that George Taylor Morris.  He kept it together knowing that his health probably wasn't the best.  Through your tears.  Through your tears.  She was all fucking twatty.  She was sexy though, right?  Yeah.  She was...  What's her name's daughter?  From...  You're fired.  No.  No.  Weakest link.  Yeah.  The weakest link.  You're fired. 
[01:27:30]  You're fired.  That's the Donald.  I don't know.  You're fired.  What was hers again?  The weakest...  You are the weakest link.  Oh, that's right.  Goodbye.  Oh, yeah.  Goodbye.  You are the weakest link.  Goodbye.  Well, her daughter worked alongside us for a little bit.  Having that fucking frigid bitch.  She was cute.  What?  Redhead.  The daughter was cute.  Oh, the daughter.  To give her a good spanking.  I thought you meant the mother.  You're lovely.  Can we find the Bruce Kelly clip?  I know.  Bruce Kelly.  It'd be great to go to break with.  Oh, yes.  Through your tears.  The stupid who made the guy cry.  Through your tears.  I fucking love the who, but I've never broken down and cried. 
[01:28:00]  No.  Even when they play Rain or Me.  Rain or Me.  Rain or Me.  Rain or Me.  I didn't even cry when Pete Townsend sent me files.  Get it?  Because they were child porn.  Fucking Anthony sucks.  Yes.  Because I can't listen to Rain over Me anymore.  Because I just made it my own and said,  It's rain over me.  But Ed had to point out it's rain or. 
[01:28:30]  It should have been rain over me, but rain or.  With that dumb apostrophe.  Or.  Yeah.  Just put the V in there.  What does that mean, or?  Why would they say that?  It means over.  It's over, but with a, it's kind of, I guess it's an English thing.  Rain or.  Rain or.  And the rain poured all the, all the planes.  Do they say rain over me when they sing it, though?  It sounds like a saying love rain on me, but it's because he's saying or me.  Yes.  And this doesn't.  There you go. 
[01:29:00]  Rain or me.  Fucking it's over.  And he goes, oh me, oh me, oh me, oh me, oh me.  I just thought, I thought all these years that he was just trying to fit over into that.  Rain or me.  You can't fit over in there without shoe wanting it.  Of course you can, but he has to go with all of them.  Maybe he's saying rain or me.  Like the chick wants to have a picnic, and he's going, look, rain or me.  Because he wants to stay home and fuck her in the shitter.  I like that description. 
[01:29:30]  To make it rain.  That makes you young.  That's fine.  Chocolate rain or me.  Chocolate rain or me.  Chocolate rain.  Oh, stop the rain or me.  Rain or me.  Have you ever seen the rain or me?  I'm going to do this all day.  Rain or me. 
[01:30:00]  Rain or me.  Yeah, because it does sound on me.  It sounds like on, yeah, but it's warm.  It's a combination of on and over.  Rain or me.  You want to go to break with Bruce Kelly?  Sure.  It's one of my favorite clips from the satellite years.  Stupid Bruce Kelly.  What gig was this?  We weren't invited because Hugh Pinero hated us, but they sent half the fucking company  to cover this thing. 
[01:30:30]  What was it?  Was it one of those Live 8s or something?  I think it might have been Live 8.  Was it Live 8?  2005.  2005.  It might have been Live 8.  Yeah.  Yeah, they sent the entire company except us.  Oh, right.  Because they were trying to fucking hide us.  Thanks.  They continue to hide us, but not as much as they used to.  Tanks.  And Bruce Kelly fucking lost his mind after the Who got together for the 80th time or  something.  And just lost it.  So we go to break with this. 
[01:31:00]  Is this live?  Yes, we're live.  Bruce, where were you, buddy?  I was right up under these photogs.  You know, it's amazing watching Pete Townsend and Roger Daltrey perform these songs after  all these years and still have the full spirit of what they do under control.  I mean, you know, Townsend just continues to be an amazing guitar player.  I'm sorry.  I'm absolutely crying.  I can't help it.  I really can't.  This is no fake.  You know, the whole moment just kind of got to me with that video. 
[01:31:30]  Yeah, the video was very powerful.  Yeah, yeah.  That was...  This is very awkward.  I'm sorry.  But it was just very...  I mean, you know, it's just the Who.  You know, I can't help but be a 14-year-old kid out there with the Who.  And that's it.  I'm sorry.  You were seeing them live, I guess.  That was in color?  Yeah.  Yeah, they were live on stage, but the black and white was happening on the big screens, too.  So...  Through your tears.  Wow. 
[01:32:00]  So there's two more to go here at Hyde Park.  I feel like an idiot.  I'm sorry, really.  No, no.  It's just overwhelming.  That's what this...  You know, that really is what this is all about.  There are certain moments that touch everybody.  Yeah.  Uh...  What were you thinking?  Anyway.  Fuck yeah!  La la la la!  La la la la! 
[01:32:30]  How annoying is that when someone's enjoying Metallica?  Gosh.  Illible.  What an ugly girl.  That is horrific.  I'm debating.  What is that?  I'm debating talking about this.  Nah.  He's all right.  I feel bad for him.  Yeah, he's all right, sort.  I like the guy.  I like the guy.  What if she likes Star Wars?  Who cares?  Yeah, exactly.  A lot of people like Star Wars.  A lot of people just aren't ugly, career-ruining fat pigs. 
[01:33:00]  Hence the, what were you thinking?  Boy.  Put it all together in your head, people.  Yeah, we hate her.  She's hateable.  Hey, uh...  This fucking Lindsay Lohan.  Jesus Christ.  Poor girl.  They finally gave her 30 days in jail, right?  Because she's just a dope, a fucking addict, a stupid bitch that can't get her shit together.  She's a brat.  And now she's got to show her pink in Playboy because she needs money.  And, uh... 
[01:33:30]  Yeah, she's a brat.  And she went to court for probably the 10th time, I don't even know, on probation violations.  They finally gave her 30 days, and that 30 days turns out to be a few minutes in jail.  Wait, did she actually go in and go out or no?  Uh, that's what they were saying in the last night I checked.  They said she could.  You know, she's got to surrender by November 9th.  And the thing is, they say she'll be out the same...  L.A. is a fucking joke.  It's overcrowded.  Yeah, TMZ was saying that, uh, yeah, she goes in and out, though.  But a repeat offender like that, why shouldn't she, after all of the violations, like, what 
[01:34:00]  does she do?  Why is she fucking allowed to continue to walk?  Uh, she'll just fucking...  She'll kill herself.  Yeah.  By accident.  It'll be, uh, accidental, but that's where she's headed.  Yeah, or she'll fucking, something else bad will happen with somebody else.  She's just a brat.  She had a fucking...  She had her life right there.  She had a good life.  Ugh.  Now she's...  Tabloid dunce.  Now she has to go to Playboy and show off those fucking freckly tits.  I'd love to suck them.  She's a little ragged around the edges, that's for sure.  She's a little rough now, Jimmy. 
[01:34:30]  Come on.  Oh, I'd suck her fucking tits.  Would you just, would you suck them dry?  I'd fucking, I would actually hold her fucking freckled Annette Bening back and suck her  tits.  Look, the picture Sam's got up right now, holy shit, if that, if that, uh, uh, chick was  in Playboy, fuck yeah, but that's not the version you're gonna get.  Nope.  That's the, uh, about 18-year-old Lindsey.  You're gonna get the shitty version.  She's really taking a, taking a turn for the worse.  You know, they're gonna have to prop up her back and all sorts of shit. 
[01:35:00]  That's some Playboy voodoo to make sure everything is set right.  Yeah, you think they're gonna photoshop a little bit?  Look at that.  Look at that.  Do a hustler already, you fucking goody gumdrops.  I wanna see fucking meat.  You wanna see this, you wanna see the areas that don't smell like the rest?  Yeah.  The little spots that smell different than the skin?  Do you like when they open their pussies nice and wide in those magazines?  No, I don't actually.  I like when it's, the legs are open.  Well, I, my favorite one is when they're on their hands and knees from the back and 
[01:35:30]  you can see the fucking big pussy lips hanging below the, like, oh my God.  It's like somebody laying out your onion rings and cake in the same photo.  Maybe those aren't the sexiest foods.  You like when it looks like a blown out ball bag?  Yeah, I do actually.  I love that.  Oh, shit.  That's fucking hilarious.  Her vagina looks like a blown out scrotum.  I mean, look.  Like someone shoved a fucking firecracker in your ball bag. 
[01:36:00]  Right.  We sort of have the same shit.  It was just.  That's great.  When you look closely, you're like, wait a minute.  That, that.  That could be that.  That could, that could have been a ball bag.  That could be that.  Absolutely.  It's all the same parts.  Yeah, they just kind of change them around, switch them.  Now, what year is that Lindsay Lohan pick from?  Because that.  That's a few years old.  Marilyn Monroe hairdo.  Yeah.  Big tits.  You'd want to see that in Playboy.  Absolutely.  Fuck yeah.  Lick those big tits.  Big tits.  I do want to lick her fucking big tits. 
[01:36:30]  I can't even say it without cursing.  Yeah.  Yes.  Would you leave hickeys on the nipples?  No, I would leave hickeys on the fat underside.  I would, I would, I would fucking like slowly scrape my teeth over the nipples.  Not hard.  Yeah.  Just enough to make her clip pop its head out of the fucking foxhole.  Oh yeah?  Yeah.  Some say she has to serve six days, 20% of the sentence.  She's not going to.  I heard TMZ was reporting that it would be in and fucking out.  She's got to basically report, do a little paperwork and get the fuck out.  What a fucking joke LA has with celebrities. 
[01:37:00]  It's pretty sad, isn't it?  Disgusting.  Because this broad isn't going to fucking listen to nobody.  Yep.  Well, she's, God, she had the world by the balls too.  What are you doing?  She's just fucking brat.  Now she's not, no one wants to hire her, so she has to go overseas to make money.  She can't act.  And now she's got to be in Playboy.  Yeah.  How much she got?  A mil.  That's it?  Lindsay Lohan.  A mil seems like a lot, but in her world it's probably not.  Probably just scratching the surface of the money she needs to, you know, pay some bills 
[01:37:30]  and things.  I would love a sexual interlude with Lindsay Lohan.  Some of these girls pull it off, like just being fucked up and drunk and going out, and  that's like their career, you know?  Yeah.  But she wasn't able to really, I think she just took it a little too far.  Well, she had real talent, that's the problem.  Like Kim Kardashian doesn't have real talent.  Yeah.  Lindsay Lohan was in movies, and good movies by that.  Now she's this.  Now she's fucking this. 
[01:38:00]  I guarantee she has bad breath.  You think?  Yeah.  Fuck.  That's funny.  What a good, what a weird observation.  You might be right, though.  I bet you her breath is horrendous.  They're starting to look at her teeth like they're starting to look horrible for her age.  She fixed them?  Yeah.  Her teeth were all like yellowed and stuff, and she just got-  That was only two weeks ago.  She got new chompers just put on.  Chompers.  They're choppers.  Or are they chompers?  No.  I think either.  How old is she?  Chompers.  Chompers.  She's still in her 20s, right?  Oh yeah, definitely.  Did she have them put on, Sam, or just cleaned?  I think she had new ones. 
[01:38:30]  I think she had caps put on.  Oh, what an asshole.  I had mine clean recently.  Get your fucking-  Have regular teeth.  Everyone's teeth had to be the exact same length like they're Nazis.  Yes.  Fucking assholes.  Just clean them.  What's wrong with that?  Floss and clean them.  Have them whitened.  She's 25.  Ugh.  What valueless-  Wow.  Fucking blithering idiot she is.  That's a rough-ass 25.  Woo, and I love to fuck her.  She's-  Woo.  She's only 25?  Yeah.  Jesus.  Yeah, nerds to her.  That's a rough 25, man.  Holy fuck. 
[01:39:00]  Wow.  Ah, whatever.  But, you know, LA's just letting her do whatever the fuck she wants.  They really are.  The judicial system out there, when it comes-  Everything from fucking-  From OJ to the Menendez brothers, they were just a high profile.  They blow every fucking time the spotlight is on those shit prosecutors, they blow it.  Mm-hmm.  Okay.  Ew, let me see her fucking awful-  First of all, she's-  So, am I right?  That's bad breath right there.  Maybe.  You're looking at bad breath.  It looks like- 
[01:39:30]  She looks like she has like a placky, smoky teeth.  Yeah, like that cigarette's right there on that side.  And it's dark in between the teeth a little bit.  Yeah.  She's smoking on that side.  She hasn't flossed in years, I bet.  Yeah.  Would you kiss that?  Yes.  Of course I would.  Those are her new teeth.  Yeah, that's good.  Let's see her new teeth.  Her new chompers.  Why does she do something with her fucking-  How about a new forehead?  What a balding zilch.  Wow, man.  She looks like a-  She looks like Brundlefly in that picture with those big glasses and that dumb forehead.  Ah.  Wow, that is a big forehead. 
[01:40:00]  What's that about?  Oh, God, I hope her hair's falling out.  How great would that be?  Yeah.  I can't wait to see them taking her out of a fucking building in a body bag.  That's always a great shot.  From behind police tape while fans gather.  Yeah.  Saying it's too bad.  Yeah.  They took her too soon.  Shut up.  She's doing it to herself.  She'll be on one of those end of the Oscar death reels, you think? 
[01:40:30]  Mm-hmm.  I guess.  I'll be like, oh, remember.  I guess.  Oh, boy.  We're learning what killed good old Bubba Smith today.  What?  From the Police Academy movies.  How did it happen?  Big black guy.  Yes.  Died from an overdose of diet pills.  What?  I didn't know you could die from diet pills.  Did you know that?  Uh, yeah.  I would assume you could. 
[01:41:00]  What are they?  Fucking, it's like speed.  Taking off of that shit.  Did you hear Michael Winslow doing Led Zeppelin with his mouth?  He's dead too, right?  Winslow.  I have no idea.  No.  Did you hear him do his Led Zeppelin?  You don't like his noises?  You know what?  I'll just never forget the day he ran away from our show before we could interview him.  He did.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  You haven't heard this yet?  Michael Winslow does Whole Lotta Love by Led Zeppelin. 
[01:41:30]  Oh, boy.  You know the song.  Which song is it?  Which song is it?  I hate Michael Winslow.  Michael Winslow.  He's a guy with a guitar.  The drums are him with his mouth, of course.  Why are you?  Uh, legs up and then...  You want to do the original artist's key of E?  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  Let's do this.  You need coolin'. 
[01:42:00]  Honey, I'm not foolin'.  I think it's turned up so fucking loud.  I'm distorted. 
[01:42:30]  I'm enjoying it.  He's doing all the noise except for the acoustic guitar.  With his mount.  Oh, brother.  That's great.  Oh, what are you doing?  Wrapping it up, are you? 
[01:43:00]  He's doing an acolyte guitar.  That's pretty amazing.  There's so many effects on that thing that it sounds all distorted like a guitar.  Oh, but we couldn't do that.  Well, it's part of what he's doing in the mic, but it's a lot of it is the electronics.  It's probably his own microphone.  Yeah.  He's got a whole sound system. 
[01:43:30]  You just got to go like, it's easy.  Yeah.  Not bad, right?  Yeah, but it's like, it's easy.  How many views does that have?  28.  Wow.  2 million.  Jesus.  The correct answer.  It's the correct answer.  Jesus.  What were, what was the, I wish I could remember the valiant units of money. 
[01:44:00]  I know.  I have them.  What are they called?  You wrote it down, Travis?  Of course I do.  I write everything down.  Because you never know when someone's going to want something.  That's true.  47 flunks, I believe is.  Slunks.  No, slunks.  Slunks.  Is equal to one Shecknerker.  Oh, Shecknerker.  Shecknerker.  Shecknerker.  That's right.  With one flunk, you can buy a Mercedes.  Yes.  Now someone's saying we've got to check out his Hendrix bit.  Oh, I don't think so.  I've seen that.  He's in a, you've seen his Hendrix movie.  Was he?  Yeah, that's where he started. 
[01:44:30]  He was in a Shecknerker movie.  We wouldn't know because we weren't able to ask him any questions because he ran.  He ran out of there.  He didn't walk.  He ran away from us.  Because there were sexual dealings going on.  And I guess he's a Christian.  Oh, is he?  Yeah.  Cool.  To the sound of the nails going in.  Get it?  Well, it's obviously all just made by him.  Just like Hendrix.  You think there's really an audience there or not?  Not.  Not at all. 
[01:45:00]  All right.  He's not doing all it.  King, make me.  Enough of him.  Not a fan.  He just keeps doing guitar noises. 
[01:45:30]  I know.  It's terrible.  Yeah.  Not a fan.  How about a xylophone?  Let's hear the immigrant song.  He loves Zeppelin.  No hell of a rock and roll can never die.  Because we always rock alive.  Mercy, mercy, mercy.  Woo!  We can have all this on tape and no one know.  He does good impersonations.  We're in the rock and roll heaven, baby.  We think they're the real people.  We got a special rock and roll president.  I can see how a white comic could fall for him.  From the group, Led Zeppelin. 
[01:46:00]  Featuring Robert Plant and Jimmy Page.  No one's ever said that when they say Zeppelin.  Oh.  Is he going to be bonkers?  The first hit song ever written by Robert Plant was the immigrant song.  Yes, my friends, the immigrant song was an accident.  Oh my god, just do this.  Robert, shut up!  Trying to inject some personality into it?  Personality?  Oh, mingy. 
[01:46:30]  He heard his finger and he's yelling.  Now he's making guitar noises with his mouth.  Again.  Yeah, he's wearing a white suit and it's been fucking cheers and put into the master at the  end.  Now he's doing it with his mouth.  Now you can do it all at the same time.  He's wearing a blonde.  He looks like 20 women are fucked.  He looks like a blonde wig. 
[01:47:00]  Enough of him.  God.  Hey, we got the judge who beat his daughter thing.  That's a big story today.  Oh, yeah.  We got that shit.  I think so.  Are we going to be able to make it through the entire recording?  Why?  Well, you know, I heard yesterday there was a little issue.  What was the issue?  Well, there was somebody listening to the tape, to the audio, and it was very disturbing 
[01:47:30]  and couldn't quite make it through the recording.  On a different show, you mean?  Yeah.  Without, you know, maybe starting, getting a little emotional.  What?  What?  Well, it's...  You're being vague.  How vague am I being?  I'm trying to figure out what show...  Fez?  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Seriously?  Well, yeah.  He got a little upset because...  It's upsetting.  He doesn't like it.  It's a girl getting hit and crying and this overbearing father is... 
[01:48:00]  You don't...  If you don't know...  I know.  I don't think you know what was on.  How is it upsetting if you don't know the person?  Well, it's a poor girl and she's being beaten by her horrid father.  What's the story about?  What's the story?  He's making a girl that will go out with me.  This is watching one being constructed right there on video.  What's wrong with her, too?  Oh, she had cerebral palsy, right?  No, she had some...  It's like...  It's considered a cerebral palsy, but it's not like your typical cerebral palsy.  It makes her crave technology and electronics. 
[01:48:30]  That's why she was into computers and video games.  She has Bob Kelly-itis?  Yeah.  Dad!  You know what, Dad?  What do you mean it makes her crave shit?  Yeah, she's got like this weird brain thing where she craves technology and needs to have it.  Is that a real thing?  I don't know, but she wasn't going like, don't hit me, darling.  It wasn't a real thing when we were growing up.  She sounded like a walk to like a regular person.  Let's see this beating.  I want to make a list of all the things that weren't a real thing when we were growing up.  Exactly. 
[01:49:00]  All these made-up diseases.  AIDS?  Yeah.  God damn it.  It's a myth.  So the judge beats disabled daughter on video.  But this happened years ago.  2004.  The daughter is just now putting it out.  Oh.  Why?  Because she doesn't like her dad, I guess.  Oh, fair enough.  That's great.  Right here it is.  Put it back on against the instructions.  Yeah.  Okay, go get my belt.  Go get the big one.  I've already spanked her.  I'm going to spank her now.  Oh, boy. 
[01:49:30]  Oh, boy.  That's a good shot.  A 16-year-old girl is just like...  Hot.  It's hot.  It's so inappropriate.  It's so inappropriate.  Well, I haven't seen this yet, to be honest with you.  He's jerked off three times.  Yeah, he is.  It's pretty bad.  Now, he's going to get the big belt.  That's a pretty good fucking video quality setup.  How about you edit your video?  I know.  Jesus.  How much do we have to see of this?  Well, she...  Let's get to the spanky.  It's an empty room.  Quick.  I think she just took it off there and popped it on. 
[01:50:00]  Put this little hottie in there.  Oh, great.  So I'm going to take a shit first.  Yeah.  The father's got to take a shit.  Well, she did.  Oh, so she don't fucking splat.  Yeah.  She doesn't know she's getting beat yet.  Get Allison out of the room.  See?  Now, he's got to...  Get over here.  Oh, shit.  Bend over that bed.  Dad.  Bend over that bed.  Bend over the bed.  And the lights get dim.  Bend over the bed.  Bend over the bed. 
[01:50:30]  I'm going to keep beating you on your legs.  Bend over the bed.  Stand up.  No.  Stand up.  Stand over the bed.  Sounds like Sean Roush.  Bend over the bed.  Do you want me to...  Jesus.  What a fucking animal.  Pause this.  I'm not going to...  Oh, in mids fucking swipe, you got him.  You can...  I'm not going to cry, but Jesus.  I know.  That's fucking brutal.  It's terrible.  What a terribly behaved child. 
[01:51:00]  A lot of us...  A lot of us got hit growing up, but never like fucking that.  Especially because she's old enough to...  Holy shit.  Yeah.  It's like, you don't do that.  That's a beating like that doesn't...  Isn't justified by anything that a kid would do.  And the beating continues?  Unless, you know, she brings somebody home.  I guess it's 10 so far.  It gets way worse than this.  It gets worse.  Let's see.  Oh, my God.  The way he's talking to her and stuff, it gets way worse.  All right.  Let's watch this. 
[01:51:30]  He's a psycho.  Yeah.  How do you do this?  Bend over like I said, David.  Oh, he's like manhandling her to...  Bend over the fucking man.  Lay down.  I'll break you in your fucking face.  Roll over.  I'll break you in your fucking face.  Is that enough?  She told you to take that fucking thing off the computer?  Stop.  Here.  There's only one reason I can think of to beat a daughter like this.  One time. 
[01:52:00]  The mom gets involved too?  Oh, yeah.  Holy shit.  Let me ask you this before I see it.  The mom just took the belt out of the father's hand.  Yeah.  Is the mother...  Like the father's obviously a piece of shit.  Yep.  Like you...  He's a judge.  He must have been an awful...  Just a cunt of a judge.  Like Judge Smales.  Didn't want to give them the death penalty.  Kid just wanted a fresca.  What did she do again?  She had something on her computer.  She wasn't supposed to have a game and...  She got caught downloading pirated stuff. 
[01:52:30]  Yeah, pirated stuff.  That's it?  Yeah.  Well, as long as it wasn't on my CDs.  Yeah.  That's it?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But the...  What a fucking scum.  I guess they told her before not to do it again, and then she did it again, so...  He's a piece of shit, the guy.  He's awful.  He should be fucking put in jail.  You can't fucking...  It's old now, right?  Yeah, but I mean...  But the...  He should be beaten.  He should be taken out.  He's obviously humiliated by this, though.  It will ruin his life, because nobody will ever look at...  For the rest of his life, no one will look at him the same. 
[01:53:00]  He's this guy.  But the mother...  I wonder if she takes the belt, because she hits lighter than the father.  Oh, yeah?  Who cares at that?  I don't know.  No, no, but I mean, she's one of those...  At this point, it's too late anyway.  You see the shots that Broad took?  Yeah.  I wonder if he hits the mother, too.  There's a weird situation that happens with the mother thing.  Let me see this, because I wonder if she did that.  You get over on your stomach, and you let me spank you on the belt.  You're small.  No.  See?  He's like, I'm small.  I'm going to spank you.  He's all revved up.  You turn over like a 16-year-old and take it.  They're getting off on this shit. 
[01:53:30]  Turn over.  See, she's doing that.  The mother wants to do it.  Turn over.  I'm going to get another.  Turn over.  And now he's going out to get another belt.  Now.  All the way on your stomach.  Damn, she laid in.  Thank you.  All right, one smack.  That should be it.  That she's trying to stop the beating.  She might.  Yeah, she might be trying to stop it.  She's trying to stop the beating.  But the father ran out to get another belt.  The father's a sociopath.  Yeah.  Complete fucking logic.  He's a sociopath. 
[01:54:00]  He deserves everything he gets, man.  This is the torturous aspect of this whole fucking video when I was watching it.  Now she's in the room alone on the bed, sort of weeping quietly.  The parents are out of the room.  The room is dark.  And they leave her alone for a little bit.  Now in her head, she's got to be like,  Oh, I guess that's over.  That sucked.  It's terrible.  I never got my leg.  And then he comes back in.  Get on your fucking stomach on the bed.  Now.  Get on the stomach or I'm going to start beating you again.  Get on your stomach.  Get on your stomach, I said.  Get on your stomach. 
[01:54:30]  She's reaching around onto her stomach.  Get on your goddamn stomach.  Get on your stomach.  Get on your stomach.  Get on your stomach.  Jesus.  You want to put some more computer games on?  Yes.  You want some more?  Yes.  The kid's crying and he's beating her with a belt.  The video's only half over.  Fucking computer. 
[01:55:00]  It continues.  I don't even want one of the goddamn half.  See all the problems they caused?  You're tuning, son of a bitch.  You're gaming, son of a bitch.  Bitch, get the fuck out.  Get the fuck out of my house.  Randy.  Be more funny.  Fucking queers and retards and girls that download software.  The mother's a codependent slob.  She's trying to stop the beating.  She lives with a fucking, probably a rageaholic. 
[01:55:30]  Are you happy?  Huh?  What a bully.  He's right in her face.  He's smacking her.  Is it fun to disobey your mom and dad?  Huh?  Fuck you, mom, and fuck you, dad.  You don't deserve to fucking be in this house.  Disobedient.  What happened to you, Hillary?  Once you were an obedient, nice little girl.  Now you lie, cheat, and steal.  She's a woman. 
[01:56:00]  Putting the fucking game on my head.  I'll just keep beating you and beating you.  That's how upset I am.  He loves this.  I think his dick is hard.  I bet it is.  Yes.  Too much?  No, mine is.  Six months.  What?  Six fucking months.  Got it?  No.  Got it?  I think he's pulling her hair or something.  He's just a bully.  He's getting off on her.  Beating this kid.  Yep.  A lot of people tapping out.  A lot of people tapping out.  A lot of people have.  That's brutal, man.  If I hear so much as you raise your fucking voice. 
[01:56:30]  Look at this.  Listen to him.  Or your mother with the wrong tone.  Or if you do one little thing on you, look at me fucking wrong.  Someone should just, like, as they're walking down the street, just keep punching this guy in the face.  Yeah.  And then someone else, as he's shopping, maybe, bam, just punch him in the face.  Got it?  Are you happy?  Yes.  You've caused this.  But you're just fucking obedient.  You know I'm not going to put up with it, don't you? 
[01:57:00]  Did you think I was fooling?  Does he need to go around with this?  Bully motherfucker.  There's still time left.  Still another couple of minutes.  Does he come back?  That guy's a creep.  That's so great.  She ruined his life.  Yeah.  Good.  With this.  I told you, don't put Kazaa on your computer.  Oh.  Kazaa.  Who's that down?  What's this?  Are you listening to this now?  Yes, ma'am.  Don't touch one other thing. 
[01:57:30]  She's probably got welts on her fucking legs and shit.  Oh, my God.  That was a fucking beating.  That guy.  Is that understood?  Okay.  He's had to respond publicly.  Now, I will leave.  I got it.  Oh, you don't?  You are coming.  But I'm coming back in, goddammit.  After you beat the shit out of your own daughter, do you go back and just start reading the newspaper?  Yeah.  What do you do?  What do you do?  Well, you know that was a regular occurrence, obviously. 
[01:58:00]  That was not a first-time fucking occurrence.  No.  Fucking should be pulling a gun out of that cab of fucking dresser and go berserk.  You certainly fucking understand.  Yeah.  You understand when that shit happens.  Like, you really want to see that guy just taken apart by the fucking men that he has to put in jail that he couldn't talk to that way?  Just ass-raped.  You're sleeping on my couch in Allison's room.  Get a blanket and go down there.  Why?  I don't know.  Does the father want to jerk off on her, too? 
[01:58:30]  Yeah.  Fucking creep.  Get your blanket and go down there.  By the way, it's all on video.  Uh-huh.  The mom is hateable, too, man.  Yeah, but I'm telling you, the mom was trying to stop that beating.  Yeah.  Great.  She should have thrown her own body in between.  If that's a fucking mother's defense, is beating her also so that the father ain't going to beat her.  You jump in front of that fucking belt.  You claw that fucking cocksucker's eyes out. 
[01:59:00]  No, because this is my take from the video.  I'm not defending the mothers, but she's one of those sick fucking broads that is attracted to violent piece-of-shit men.  She's married to this piece-of-shit.  I don't know if he hits the wife or not, but it wouldn't surprise me.  He has to.  It wouldn't surprise me.  The way he beats that daughter, you can see that was the mother's way of stopping that beating.  We got Anthony V in Brooklyn.  They were on GMA this morning, the mom and daughter.  Mom claimed she was controlled by a husband.  Watching her do that, she hit her.  Mind control. 
[01:59:30]  The mother was trying to be firm and take it from the belt from the father, like, we're going to do this.  She hit the daughter once and then closed the door.  And the father couldn't fucking leave it alone.  No, he couldn't keep his dick down.  He had to get his dick hard again and hit the daughter.  I hope the download was worth it.  Yeah, right?  What do you think the download was?  Oh, it was a game.  Yeah, some kind of fucking game thing.  I literally hope that guy kills himself.  I hope that guy fucking shoots himself in the head.  I bet you it was Sim City.  That's a good one.  Let's go to Dustin. 
[02:00:00]  Dustin, what do you got?  Hey, what's going on?  What are you using?  Let me play just something?  Yeah, what are you doing?  How come you're not sweeping or something?  This guy filed a criminal complaint against me this morning.  Why?  He filed a complaint against you?  He filed a complaint against you?  He did it to like 20 of us.  Oh, of course he did.  Good for you guys.  Good for you, man.  Good for you guys exposing this piece of shit.  I don't think he's going to get much sympathy.  Wait, what are you all about?  Are you connected to the story or are you just like us? 
[02:00:30]  No, I just woke up this morning and seen it and decided to look him up and put his number  out there so everybody could let him know.  Do we have his number?  We should call him and just ask him if he'll talk on the radio.  It's a 361.  No, we can't give it up.  No, no, no, no, no, no, Dustin, please don't do that to us.  I would love to, but thank you.  We got to let you go.  That is a whole can of worms.  You have no idea.  Yeah.  Wow, I got to say, man, that fucking clip shut all three of us down. 
[02:01:00]  Yeah.  It's very rare when all three of us are shut down.  That is enraging.  It's a bully and the way he's talking to her, like he's trying to be a tough guy with a  16-year-old girl.  Yeah, with a 16-year-old girl.  How about some of the fucking guys you put up?  How about some of the guys you put up?  Get in a room with them and try to fucking spank them.  Oh, would they choke him with that belt?  Well, I guarantee you he talks to them horrible from behind the bench.  But just a real brave guy.  As a man, one-on-one.  But over a dumb download?  I was wondering. 
[02:01:30]  There's so much more behind that stuff.  You don't spank a girl like that without...  Of course.  How can you spank someone like that?  I think that's such a sexual thing.  Yeah.  When you're a little kid and you get fucking whacked for doing something, but when you're  spanking, you're...  Bend over the bed.  Fucking asshole.  Yeah.  Get your butt up on there.  Arch that back.  Oh, I hope he loses everything and fucking shoots himself.  That would be great.  I would love that.  Oh, I'd love to read that news.  Somebody's saying we should play the Benny Hill music just to... 
[02:02:00]  Get everyone happy again.  Because that's a bummer right there.  That's a bummer.  That's a terrible video.  That's a real drag.  We have audio of him, though?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  See, I've got to hear this.  I haven't heard this yet.  We can lose Benny Hill music.  We could try it.  No, we can't.  Maybe we should.  I don't know.  It's just really upsetting.  I think we all acknowledge how upsetting it is.  It's terrible.  Oh, God, you dumbass.  By the way...  Is he trying to make an excuse, or what is he doing?  What's his fucking take on it? 
[02:02:30]  By the way...  By the way...  Before I had a son, I thought it would be okay...  Your son.  ...to do a little hitting, to discipline.  Yeah.  Fuck no.  I can't even imagine a scenario where I'd be able to do that.  Just throw spaghetti against the wall.  Well, I'm not...  That works, too.  Huh?  That works, too.  Just throw spaghetti against the wall.  Oh, just kind of, like, make a scene?  Yeah, make a scene.  Make the kid cower.  Kid ain't cowering.  Yeah.  It's not real discipline.  By the way, do you know how many fucking threats this guy is going to get over that? 
[02:03:00]  Fuck yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh.  The internet, even if the guy didn't publish his number on the line, people will find it.  Yeah.  Brian Stone writes, you had a hundred-year-old woman getting punched in the face was a laugh  riot.  Yep.  You know what?  There's...  I wasn't affected by the hundred-year-old lady getting punched in the face in the lobby  of that.  That was enraging.  It was enraging, yeah.  Of course it was.  But here's the circumstances where I kind of separate the two.  It was a fucking criminal doing it.  Stranger.  A stranger criminal punching this woman in the face. 
[02:03:30]  Tragic, yes.  But it wasn't the father who was supposed to be the person that you look at as the, you  know, provider and protector of you, beating a little girl.  Beating the shit out of her.  Instead of an old lady who probably, you know, I'm sure, you know, she's lived a life.  So, you know, she probably got hit in the head and went, ah, I remember getting hit in  the head in the 30s.  Sucked.  Yeah.  You know, it's just one of those situations where it's not the same.  And it was one punch.  Yeah.  She goes down.  This guy with the psychological thing of pounding it, it just, you know. 
[02:04:00]  Over and over again.  And all you were doing was talking during laughing.  Right.  Yes.  The belt came out.  Exactly.  That's when my father brought the belt out.  That really does look fucking brutal.  You ever get hit like that?  Not that bad.  I've been hit.  I got hit.  Nothing like that.  Once or twice like that.  But not like that repetitive wham, wham, wham.  Over and over again.  Yeah.  He used to pull his swats with the belt sometimes.  You know.  If you had to get a lot of syllables in. 
[02:04:30]  Yeah.  You know.  Don't ever do that.  Oh.  Get.  And.  If it's a long fucking soliloquy, he'd pull back a little.  It was just like, knock it off.  Whap.  Did that enrage you?  Then you get the good one.  I don't know if it enraged me.  No.  As a kid, it made me feel like, what did I do?  Hit me, baby.  One more time.  What did this guy say?  What was his response?  Because he's fucking.  Acknowledge that that's you in the video?  I don't want to talk right now, sir. 
[02:05:00]  Okay.  I've got a lawyer.  Have you had a conversation with your daughter?  Sure.  And what, what, what?  She's mad because I've ordered her to bring the car back in a nutshell.  But, yeah, that's me.  I lost my temper.  I spanked her.  Her mother was there.  She wasn't hurt.  It was a long time ago.  She wasn't hurt.  Yeah.  What a fucking cunt.  Wasn't hurt.  Do you know what that does to it?  Do you know what that does to it, Ken?  Just the way he talked to her.  Get up.  What a fucking cunt.  Yeah.  Get your butt up on her.  You goddamn fucking face you, baby. 
[02:05:30]  Wasn't hurt.  It was a long time ago.  How long was it?  Alex, it's far, far away.  About six years.  I apologize to her.  I really don't want to get into this right now.  Sorry, you have to.  Because, as you can see, my life's been made very difficult.  Aww.  Way, way, way, way.  It's life.  Life, baby, it's difficult.  It's life, baby, it's difficult.  You deserve all of it and more, you cunt.  Yeah.  Good.  Be Golf B in New York Palomont.  I don't blame Fes for crying after hearing that. 
[02:06:00]  You know what?  Fair enough, man.  That made me angry.  Fair enough, no.  It made me angry.  I've seen too many awful videos to cry at that, but that made me really angry.  That one's rough.  Angering.  Oh, his life.  As you can see, my life's been made very difficult over this child.  Have you been contacted by judicial review, any of those committees out of Austin, since  this video apparently has gone viral?  I've contacted them to let them know.  And what was their response?  Do you think you're going to face any kind of suspension or discipline?  I don't know. 
[02:06:30]  In my mind, I haven't done anything wrong other than discipline my child after she was  caught stealing.  And I did lose my temper, but I've since apologized.  It looks worse than it is.  There is a story.  It'll come out in due time.  Okay.  What's the story?  We saw the story.  What are you going to justify that?  What are you talking about?  You're a fucking cocksucker.  And I, I, you can't, how can you hit a 16 year old like that if it's not some weird shit?  Uh-huh.  Get up there on the fucking bed, bend over.  On the bed, bend over.  You fucking creep.  He's, he's taking full arm swipes at her, at her stomach, her legs, anywhere he could 
[02:07:00]  fucking hit.  Yeah.  It wasn't some, you know, let me spank you on your, your hiney two times to kind of,  you know, let you know what the fuck.  That was a beating.  And you can't, by the way, the judicial review will do nothing because it had nothing to do  with his job and it was seven years ago.  You know what though?  What's going to, what's going to end up happening, happen?  Cause this plays out like this.  Uh, now that we know his name and his face, other people are going to come forward with  some fucking stories.  You hope so.  Yeah.  You hope so.  My opinion.  Um, you hope so.  My opinion. 
[02:07:30]  Hmm.  Look at his dumb fucking face.  And everyone's saying his daughter had cerebral palsy, but we said she didn't, right?  No, she had a type of cerebral palsy.  Oh, that's good.  It was like, yeah.  That's great.  He's been temporarily relieved of his duties for the next two weeks.  Duties.  But is that, is that, is that him now stepping down?  How do they really want to, they want to see who else they're going to fire.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's it.  Let's see who else knew about this and we get the review done, get you back up on the 
[02:08:00]  bench.  Oh, it's so great.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  For the rest of his life, he's that guy.  Yeah.  He's the fucking vicious shitty dad.  What a fucking bag of shit.  Shitty dad.  Judge William Adams.  This guy's dad used to hit him and, uh, well, let him tell the fucking story.  All right.  Kevin in Jersey.  Kevin.  Hey, boy.  Hi.  So I used to get spanked by my father.  I got the belt, you know, and, uh, or, or he'd hit me with his hand. 
[02:08:30]  So one time, I don't even know what I did.  I must've been like eight or nine years old.  And I hear him coming up the stairs.  I'm shitting in my, I'm shitting in my pajamas.  So I took this Hardy Boys mystery, a hardcover book, shoved it down with the back of my pants.  He bent me over my, over his knee and wham, hit me with his hand and went wham.  It was like, he was like totally shocked.  Shocked.  Has no freaking idea.  Yeah.  The Hardy Boys were great.  They'd always go out and solve the crimes. 
[02:09:00]  What about Nancy Drew?  I didn't like her.  Oh, no.  She was lesbian-ish.  Always sobbing.  My little nephew would try to make me laugh.  He'd always go, sis, did Nancy Drew pictures or something?  Says, I'd have to fill his mouth.  Jesus.  I liked that video.  He was spanking it because she was bad.  She was bad, yeah.  Way too old, though.  Christ, this guy's phone number's all over and some feedback.  Oh, yeah.  It's everywhere.  Everyone knows the number.  Why don't we call him and just see if he'll talk to us? 
[02:09:30]  It's easy to guess.  He fled town.  He fled town?  Yes.  He fled town.  His life is ruined.  He was seen packing luggage, a briefcase, and rifles into his car.  Rifles.  Of course.  He's targeted.  Go ahead.  He's a Texan.  He knows.  This guy should just be stoned every time you...  Every time...  Yeah, man.  Oh.  He rocks at him.  You can't tell people to do violent shit, dude.  I wouldn't care, though, if people did just do shit.  Yeah, but you can't encourage you.  That's her Twitter, by the way.  It would be...  I wouldn't encourage you, but it would be nice to hear. 
[02:10:00]  Is she at least getting followers out of this?  I don't know.  I was saying, yeah.  I don't know.  I heard she dropped Colin Quinn.  She's not...  Let me see it.  She's got 2,200 followers.  Ah, you know what?  Because people...  A beating like that, she should get at least 20,000 followers, man.  Fuck.  Yeah, that's a good Twitter...  What was her last tweet?  I just wanted to let everyone know that I'm all right, but please, no more phone calls  unless it's vital.  Oh.  Well, how about we talk to her?  Yeah.  Please contact me again tomorrow when I have more time.  Who is this bitch? 
[02:10:30]  People know.  She likes the attention, huh?  He's my best friend.  I don't judge him, and neither should you.  What, the father?  No, someone else.  Oh, that's somebody else.  She wants to hate her father.  You don't release this on your best friend.  She said she released it after receiving many harassing phone calls from him.  Good.  He's just a fucking...  She's flying to New York?  Yeah, she's in New York.  Oh.  Yeah, because she did GMA.  She was just on GMA.  Can Roland get her?  Yeah, get Roland.  He's working on it.  The guy...  Is he really?  The guy's...  She might be scared of Roland, though.  He kind of does look like the fucking warden in Midnight Express. 
[02:11:00]  We should talk to her when she comes in.  She'll be like, hi, like, sit down!  Oh, God.  See if she jumps.  It is my wish that people stop threatening my father.  And start offering professional help.  That is what he really needs.  Yeah, professional help.  Like a fucking sound thrashing.  Why did she release it so many years later?  Well, he just kept calling her.  He did something recently that pissed her off.  She said she didn't want to release it when it happened because she wanted the time to look back on it and release it with a sound mind instead of... 
[02:11:30]  And she's also out of that house by that age.  She was 16.  Yeah, that's the first thing that I read was that she didn't know what would happen if she released that when she was a minor.  She was probably afraid he'd kill her.  Yeah.  Or be taken away because she's still close to her mother.  She's not close to her father.  They would have taken her away.  When did she leave for good?  I left for good at 18.  Anyone know?  No.  Well, if that was 16...  Because there's something that does play in there.  When you're a minor, you're like, fuck, I'm trapped here.  But as soon as I turned 18, I fucking said, see you later. 
[02:12:00]  By the way, I just got a Twitter.  She only held on to that fucking recording, didn't she?  Yeah.  I just got a Twitter from a girl.  She goes, I'm sorry.  I don't feel sorry for the mother.  She should go to jail, too.  I'm not saying I feel sorry for the mother.  I am simply stating that was what was happening by watching the video.  That fucking mother should have thrown herself on top of the daughter and protect her to that way.  And then if that husband just starts punching her in the face, then he goes to fucking prison.  That mother did not use her motherly instincts to fucking protect that daughter. 
[02:12:30]  Hold on in.  With that said, let me just go to Joe because he heard something in the tape.  Joe in Oceanside.  Fast.  Go.  What's up, guys?  Yeah.  If you turn the video off, the volume, when the daughter's in the room by herself in between the two beatings...  Right.  You can actually hear the parents talking in the hallway, like outside, before the dad comes back in.  And the mother's going, that's enough, that's enough.  And he's going, no, I didn't get my licks in yet.  Yeah, well...  The mother took the...  The mother tried to stop it. 
[02:13:00]  She absolutely...  She didn't try.  She fucking talked.  She gave him lip service.  But she was scared that she was going to get beat.  Yeah.  If she's scared she's going to get beat, the first thing, the first priority is her daughter in that situation.  And she should have put herself physically in between her fucking cock-sucking husband and her daughter.  But, dude, if she had that mindset, she wouldn't have married that guy.  I'm not saying she's right, but that's that sick shit.  That was the only way she was fucking... 
[02:13:30]  Well, then I'm saying she's an awful mother.  Yeah.  She's a horrible mother, then.  But she's got no instinct to protect her own fucking daughter in that situation, which is anything you can do.  Hey, she's on TV with the daughter right now.  She's not with the husband.  Like, meaning, she's not protecting the husband and sticking up for him.  She's with the daughter.  And I think women are stupid who get involved in that shit.  Yeah, yeah.  But just watching that, as soon as she took the...  She was in on it a little bit. 
[02:14:00]  No, I think...  Enough.  The mother is fucking...  She took a fucking major hit.  She took a good swat at her own daughter.  That was pretty impressive for her.  I will defend the mother.  Because I'm really watching that...  She's in a tough spot.  I hate her, too.  Again, she's one of those...  It's one of those things where you have to take the...  I hate to say grain of salt, but she's one of these people that married a fucking...  An abusive piece of shit.  So that mindset's already there to begin with.  So when the fuck is...  What would it take to wake her up that she sits there and watches her daughter screaming in pain? 
[02:14:30]  Dude, absolutely.  Why would a woman who might have...  I don't know what her parents were, but why do women who are beaten by their fathers married guys that beat them?  It happens all the time.  You can't use logic.  You just gotta watch what's happening, and that was her way of stopping...  I don't even see an instinctive, motherly, nurturing, and protective ability in that woman.  That's why, you know, there should have been instinctively...  But that might make him angrier.  Like, again, that might be the pattern...  Beyond any logic that she might think, he might do this, I know, oh, this... 
[02:15:00]  Beyond that, on a visceral fucking animal level, she should have thrown herself on top of her daughter.  No, because a lot of times in crisis situations, you fucking...  You do what has to be done.  People get a really weird, cool head sometimes in these situations and do what has to be done.  I would have to agree with Jimmy.  I have.  Because in my situation, in my house, my mom ruled the household, and it was more mental than fucking physical.  And my dad allowed it to happen.  Because I think, in his mind, it was just fucking easier to deal with. 
[02:15:30]  Right.  You know, because the whole thing that Ann's talking about is probably the right thing to do, yes,  but it's so complicated after you do something like that.  I just hear it as being a terrible mother.  And then their fight...  You know, my dad should have fucking jumped in on many occasions with the crap that was going on in my house.  But he didn't.  The mother's weak.  She's really weak.  And that was her way of standing up or trying to stop the bully by tugging on the back of his shirt saying,  don't go hit her anymore.  If she was strong enough to actually throw herself on her daughter, she would not be with that guy. 
[02:16:00]  Well, that should have, you know, made her buck up.  Yeah.  Jesus Christ.  I think in the screams, she's screaming.  She's being fucking hit.  Where if you hit a fucking terrorist or an enemy combatant like that, you'd fucking go to prison.  If you were in the military interrogating somebody and started hitting them like that in this day and age, you're going to prison.  And this fucking asshole gets to hit his daughter like that,  and the mother gives her a whack just to maybe take the heat off. 
[02:16:30]  I think in a perfect world, you're absolutely right, Ann.  But I think it gets very, unfortunately, complicated.  Well, I'm just saying she's a horrible mother.  I'm not saying...  She's probably scared shitless for her own life.  Scared shitless if she did the wrong thing.  Maybe the beating would have been worse.  If she did jump on the daughter, then what's next?  Does she have to leave the house?  And is that complicated?  You know what I mean?  Sometimes you stay in a situation because it's easier and it's comfortable.  And women like this same woman, Queen Elizabeth, is saying,  as a mother, I would never let any man touch my daughter that way. 
[02:17:00]  He'd have to kill me first.  Okay, and that's the perfect way to be.  Yeah.  But for whatever reason, this woman married this guy.  And we've heard the Bob Kelly stories.  Right.  You know, Bob Kelly's mom didn't want to see her son get the shit beat out of him  by some guy that she was seeing, but it happened, unfortunately.  Well, then maybe she...  What was she supposed to do?  Maybe she wasn't the best mom either, then.  I'm just saying, there should be a primal instinct that takes over.  I agree with that. 
[02:17:30]  That shouldn't allow someone to inflict that kind of harm on your child while you watch.  But who...  I don't know what else they did.  But who knows, if he beat her more, what other situations might have been like.  In that house, maybe that wasn't the worst that could happen.  Maybe.  Maybe the mother didn't want to ask.  Again, I'm just guessing.  I don't know.  Maybe.  But how great is it that this fucking father has to take a rifle and leave town?  Yeah.  I'm pretty sure this wasn't like the first time, because she said that she set up the recording  because she knew something was going to happen. 
[02:18:00]  Yeah, yeah.  You don't just happen to fucking have a recording of a beating like that.  She knew that she did something that was going to set him off, and then she knew it was  going to be really bad.  Yeah.  So she recorded it.  Yeah.  I'm not surprised it was over a dumb little thing, too.  Kenny, what do you think?  You've seen domestic situations before.  First of all, were you bothered by that, Kenny?  By that audio?  You have to break the circle of violence.  Oh, Jesus.  It's just the worst.  Oh, Jesus.  It's just the worst.  Why? 
[02:18:30]  Emotionally, did that affect you at all?  Oh, my God.  He's dead inside.  He really is a fucking...  He's dead inside.  I'm sorry.  I'd rather talk about Jimmy at the stress factor this weekend.  He is.  He's a husk.  No, but he understands that humor is the healing medicine we all need.  Yeah.  That was disturbing, though.  Yeah.  You know the old saying.  What?  What do you say to a woman with two black eyes?  Nothing. 
[02:19:00]  She's been spoken to twice already.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, my God.  That's so old school.  Not a person listening that doesn't know that joke.  But what about that wife with...  About her stopping the beating?  I wish them all well.  Jesus.  Ken Z in Jersey writes, the mother was most likely abused or she has had serious mental  abuse by him.  Opie nailed it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Nobody fucking takes that for no reason.  Look, I knew it.  I said it's not the fucking leave it to Beaver House. 
[02:19:30]  Yes, I understand that, but it's like, it's just odd to me to see that extent of violence  towards a young kid and the mother thinks the best she could do is hit her also once.  Well, it's got to be a horrible position for the mom to be in, if you think about it.  Horrible.  She's probably too fucking scared to do the right thing, like you're saying.  Well, it muster up some fucking courage because your kid's getting beaten like you wouldn't  beat a fucking enemy.  Yeah.  Like you wouldn't beat someone in a bar fight. 
[02:20:00]  Ridiculous.  And in those situations, unfortunately, it's always over something so stupid.  Half the shit when I was growing up was always over the dumbest, stupidest, who gives a fuck  thing.  None of us were on drugs or doing anything crazy, but we got, you know, crazy shit happened  to us.  Good point.  It was always over dumb stuff.  That's a dumb teenager thing.  Who gives a fuck?  That doesn't deserve a beating.  Maybe you take the computer away or whatever for a while, but shit.  That brings back too many fucking memories I'd rather not discuss. 
[02:20:30]  Yeah.  It's, it's also, and this someone else raised this point, they're in a small town and he's  a judge.  Right.  Yeah.  I think a family court, someone says family law, whatever.  It is kind of, maybe you feel like no one's going to listen to you because abused people  are getting beaten up from what I, from what I know about them.  They never think I'm going to go tell people and everyone's going to help us or else most  mothers would never allow their daughters to be finger popped by a creepy father, but  they do.  Right.  Most, most mothers are a fucking repulsed by that. 
[02:21:00]  Right.  But they fucking, they, they allow it to happen.  They look the other way and it's like, why?  Because they don't think people will help them.  Well, if this guy was worried about his, uh, you know, his job or whatever, then, then  fucking get rid of the computer.  Obviously the computer has been a problem in that household for a while.  So, you know, well, she's obviously a thief.  We can't overlook that.  Well, she is a thief and she should have her hands removed by a hatchet.  We, uh, um, a lot of people agree with aunt, but I'm just saying that that's probably, you  know, there's a lot more that goes into it than, than simply just jumping on your, your 
[02:21:30]  kid like that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I, I don't know.  It's just odd to me.  That's all.  Yeah.  Well, did your mom get involved when your dad was?  Very upset.  Did your mom get involved when your dad was doing some stuff or did you think your dad  was, it never, it never got to the point where it was like that type of thing.  Where it was out of control.  It was, you know, whack, whack, you're done.  And then, you know, and that was, that was discipline.  He wasn't fucking, you know, get over, roll over, hitting as you're trying to, there 
[02:22:00]  are, there are definitely levels of a corporal punishment and just cried.  Here, right.  I don't know.  There hasn't dried up.  Whatever happens to this judge, I'm just going to say this.  I hope it does not end well for him.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Fuck it.  Phones are lit.  We don't have time, but let me just read a bunch of these.  Kristen in Jersey.  I had to drive my mom to the hospital once because she had a broken nose.  Russ in Atlanta.  I think the mother is just afraid to leave. 
[02:22:30]  Marcos is a regular.  The wife is probably too weak to fight back and he probably abuses her as well.  Victor, my mother used to hit me like that all the fucking time.  Ryan in Chicago.  The dad was mad about the amount of sausage in the Jimmy Dean sausage.  We should grab one of these people.  The one with the broken nose.  Are they still there?  Yeah.  Sharon, I used to take beatings and my mom used to jump in and fight with him.  I had a friend who works in a domestic abused department and a lot of judges are in that  program.  That's Melanie in Philly.  And finally, I think she also got hit because she ate a whole box of fudge, fudge, fudge 
[02:23:00]  sickles.  You want the broken nose?  Oh, yeah.  One of them.  Yeah.  I want to hear one of them.  Kristen in Jersey.  Hey, how are you?  Hey, man.  Well, I can tell you it was many, many years ago.  It was in the 80s.  But I grew up in a household.  It just was such a horrible video to listen to because, you know, I kind of put myself  right there with it.  It was regular in our house.  My mom would get us alone.  She'd apologize and cry. 
[02:23:30]  And as soon as we were in the house, she'd get beaten worse than us.  And so my stepdad since passed away, but my mom didn't leave him until she literally  feared for her life and got an order of protection and moved without him knowing where she went.  But it was regular.  And one of the things I got beaten for, I wanted to go play tennis with a boy down the street  and I wasn't allowed to leave the house.  Is that what you called it?  Tennis?  Yeah.  Juggler's balls.  Large black gentleman.  So what?  You left anyway and played tennis?  Why?  I threw the tennis racket out the window and I didn't realize he was in the room downstairs 
[02:24:00]  and saw the tennis racket go past the window.  Aw, shit.  And that's what set him off?  How would you feel if you're watching TV and a tennis racket goes flying by?  Maybe he was watching tennis.  He thought the TV exploded.  He got frightened.  No, I think the mom is definitely wrong, but it took my mom as many years to figure it  out.  So now we're close and now we're friends, but she was in a really damaged mental place.  She didn't know right from wrong and she thought right was just keeping a house over, a roof  over our heads so that, you know, we weren't homeless or we didn't have no money or anything 
[02:24:30]  like that.  Right.  Any money.  Yeah, you don't...  Anyway.  You deserve a beating.  It's a great topic for the ride to work, guys.  Yeah, I know.  It's a little deep, isn't it?  Yeah, what are you going to do?  It's in the news.  Some deep shit.  It's in the news.  It's on the intratubes.  Yeah, it's a huge story.  All right.  Thanks, Kristen.  See you on, guys.  Have a good one.  All right, man.  I didn't hear the run of Fez segment on that.  Did you?  Did you hear?  On this?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You heard it?  Yeah.  How far did they get before they had to stop the... 
[02:25:00]  They heard...  I mean, I think they played a good amount of it.  Oh, they did?  Yeah.  But what was Ronnie saying?  Ron...  Was he trying to console?  Yeah.  Well, Fez was getting more angry than sad.  Oh.  Like, Fez got really...  over the top, super angry, and started yelling at callers and...  Whoa.  Like, to the point like...  Why is he yelling at callers?  Well, that's...  It's lashing out.  Everyone's sort of on the same page with this one.  I think Ron...  I think it was Ron that pointed out that, like, this was...  Because Fez is so anti... 
[02:25:30]  By any sort of...  Violence or anything.  Violence or anything.  Violence or anything.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Corporal punishment.  Yeah.  That he actually...  This was his moment to kind of get the audience on his side.  And he got so over-the-top emotional that people were like...  Wasn't able to...  Yeah.  You're not...  You're way over the top right now.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  I have to listen to that.  I have to get that.  It wasn't a blueberry incident, was it?  No, no, no, no, no.  He was a standalone beating, though.  Sure was a standalone beating.  That's right.  The belt is not a standalone accessory. 
[02:26:00]  Not like the Kiwi.  We done with the phones?  Someone's saying Fez is anti-violence, but he's constantly threatening to beat the shit  out of various interns and people.  Well, yeah.  I mean, that...  Doesn't that kind of go against his...  Fez is under the influence at the time, I believe.  Oh, okay.  That might have been it.  Yeah.  Threw a bottle of aspirin at me and, yes, threatened.  Threatened an intern.  Why is he throwing shit at you?  This was a while back.  Okay.  If you hit you in the head, though, and you got a headache, you got the aspirin, so... 
[02:26:30]  Good call.  He gives a little...  Takes a little...  Yeah.  I was just trying to help one of the interns that Fez was shouting at, and then Fez...  I think the bottle of Advil or aspirin or whatever it was was intended for the  intern, and I became collateral damage.  Oh, you just got in the line of fire.  Yeah.  He...  Or innocent.  He apologized later.  Oh, okay.  It was all fine.  That was unnecessary.  This judge is fucked.  He really is.  Done.  His job's done.  I didn't realize...  Someone tweeted me...  Oh, that's what I wanted to say.  That the judicial review, they said that they can look at any part of your life. 
[02:27:00]  I guess that's part of...  Yeah, there's got to be an ethics kind of thing in there where you can't just, you know...  He's completely done, then.  He's done.  Let's hope so.  Absolutely.  What a bum.  That's good.  Life is ruined.  I guess we're going to have to go to the calls, right?  Yeah.  I like them.  Move on to something else.  Yeah.  Or take a break, and then move on to something else.  These are great.  Or go back to the phones after the break.  Yeah.  Fuck them.  Fuck them.  Phones don't get lit this fast.  That was fucking immediate.  Yeah.  People...  It definitely brings out emotions in people. 
[02:27:30]  It stopped all three of us.  That's very rare.  It's just like...  There's always one of us that is like, oh, come on.  This one.  That was brutal.  That was fucking brutal.  Yeah.  Yeah.  There's no reason for that.  The bullying aspect of it was just amazing.  Yeah.  That was like...  It was the whole thing.  The hitting, the bullying, the manipulation, the, you know, the way he was talking to her.  Like, all that was just...  Getting off on it.  Yeah.  Like, he was getting off on it.  Yeah.  It was creepy.  There was some kind of...  Oh, I bet as a judge, he's probably one of those guys that likes fucking the face masks 
[02:28:00]  and nipple and ball clamps and shit.  He's got the local fucking dungeon master that kicks him in the balls.  Yeah.  And then he takes it out on his daughter.  Fake moral cunt bully.  Yeah.  Right.  You think there's some sexual tension there?  Definitely.  I think so.  I mean, why are you looking to bend your 16-year-old daughter on the fucking bed?  Yeah.  Bend her over a bed.  You fucking creep.  It's ghoulish.  What, did you catch her in a bikini one time and you just couldn't stop looking?  You fucking asshole.  And it moved. 
[02:28:30]  Exactly.  Creep.  Why else would you fucking...  I don't understand it.  You ever get hit?  Yes, soap.  Never like that.  Soap in my mouth and stuff like that, but it was never...  Who's soap?  No, no, my videotapes are the sitcom.  It was the family dog's name.  Yeah.  Videotapes.  He would...  I got taxi in the mouth and all in the family.  We got it, Jim.  How many of you get a name?  But no, no, no.  I would get hit once in a while, but it was never...  Not like that.  No.  Never. 
[02:29:00]  All right, we'll continue.  Nope.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  Yeah.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Another band you ruined. 
[02:29:30]  Yeah.  I'm sorry.  Love, Rain, Horror.  Yeah.  And the clogged nose thing.  But you didn't ruin Pearl Jam, yeah.  No.  Well. 
[02:30:00]  How, how, how, how.  Thank you.  What do you want to talk about, man?  I'm a flying king.  I don't know what's on the, uh, the old itinerary.  I don't like anything else.  Itinerary.  Nothing?  Huh?  Oh, boy.  What do you like?  That gets to us.  What do you say I'm like?  Oh, I don't know.  Yeah, we're well prepared.  I know.  There's no doubt about it.  I'm sure she likes something.  Herman Cain, that's whatever. 
[02:30:30]  Sexual harassment thing.  Yeah, that's kind of catching up to him.  Oh, uh, the FCC.  Who?  We were lumped into this whole, uh, Janet Jackson thing, technically.  What happened?  With our shit problems on regular radio.  It's so great, those fucking scumbags in the FCC.  The courts are shooting them down.  Yeah, they just can't get a fine out of the Janet Jackson thing.  We're swinging back the other way.  Eight years ago already.  Eight fucking years.  A dumb nipple slip. 
[02:31:00]  Our stupid country lost their minds on a dumb nipple slip.  The sex man would have brought us back with some Janet Jackson.  He would have gotten topical.  He would have.  He likes the Janet Jackson.  And he loves getting topical.  You know, as Sam calls him, Gdavi.  Gdavi.  Gdavi.  That depends on how his name is spelled.  Gdavi.  Gdavi.  The videos they just showed everywhere last week, two weeks ago.  Yeah.  It's far worse than a dumb nipple slip.  Yep.  It doesn't make sense. 
[02:31:30]  Yeah, I think that would damage a kid a little more.  What?  The death videos?  Yeah, that.  How's it fucking lonely?  The beating videos.  You know, just that kid being beaten like that.  Way worse than nipple slip.  Show that on the news.  Yeah.  Nipple slip for a split second with something pierced through it.  I mean, that's ridiculous.  Yeah, but they really went for blood on that one.  Oh, yeah, they did.  And they're not getting anything from CBS again.  That's those shitty conservatives.  FCC shouldn't have fined CBS over Super Bowl nipple gate is what the court system is saying.  Third Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia. 
[02:32:00]  So that's out today.  Well, you know what it was?  They said that there is...  Because, again, the rules are so vague.  And they said that it's a fleeting...  They give fleeting expletives.  They give a...  Are not definable a lot of times.  But they're saying this was a fleeting thing.  So why should there be a double standard for visual and auditory?  It's basically, I think, in a nutshell what they're saying.  In a nutshell.  Yeah.  I don't know why we always...  Why do we always say in a nutshell?  It's like, what, is the shell crazy or something? 
[02:32:30]  How about a nut sunoko?  Did I say FCC?  I thought I did.  I think so.  Why?  You said FCC.  What should you have said?  I don't know.  I was the FCC.  Fuck you very much.  The FCC.  Someone's writing, don't you mean FCC?  That's what you said.  Yeah.  Tell people to clear the corn cobs out of their ears.  Oh.  Wow.  That's right.  I bet mother would say that.  Yes, she would.  Except she'd say asshole.  Get the corn cob out of your asshole.  It's time for dinner, Sam. 
[02:33:00]  Pull that out.  Stop playing with that.  Yeah, pull those fucking two sewn together corn cobs out of your asshole.  By that, I mean girthy.  He would rubber band corn cobs side by side.  Oh, nice.  Well, we're going to do a live event.  Thanks for nothing.  An Opie and Anthony holiday event.  Thanks for nothing.  We're doing this event because some idiot down the hall was amazed that we could draw people  to our live appearances, so he wanted another one.  A lot of people there last time. 
[02:33:30]  This fucking idiot.  He knows who he is.  It's funny.  That's not how you promote an event.  What?  That's not how one...  That's the only reason we're doing it.  He was amazed.  He's like, oh my God.  I'm like, yeah, we've been telling you this for years.  We have listeners.  That we have listeners.  He was so amazed.  He's like, we got to do another one of those.  So because of that, we have to do this thing.  Why?  In case people forget that we have listeners.  I don't know.  I don't know the logic behind this because I told the idiot, I go, look, if we're going  to be out and about, we want those big, huge, over-the-top events like we used to do.  With that said, we're going to have a blast at the heart. 
[02:34:00]  I love doing these.  We really are going to have a good time.  Absolutely.  But the logic that goes with this thing is unbelievable.  It's the only reason.  Because he was amazed.  He saw us in the green room.  Wow, I can't believe all the people that showed up.  We got to do this again.  And we're doing it again.  That idiot wants to meet with us this week, too.  This week is today and tomorrow.  And I don't mean on Friday who this mystery person could be.  And I'm not fucking doing tomorrow.  At this point, he knows I don't like him. 
[02:34:30]  Oh, man.  And I have no problem that he knows that.  Thanks for nothing.  An Opie and Anthony holiday event is a week from, two weeks from today.  Oh, two weeks from today.  Two weeks from today, November 17th, a Thursday, Hard Rock Cafe in Times Square, 8 to 10 a.m.,  followed by the after show from 10 to 11,  which means we're going to be there for three hours.  No.  How are we going to be able to leave at 10?  Watch me.  You've got to sign.  Yeah, sign.  A fucking sign right out the door. 
[02:35:00]  No, you've got to autograph.  You've got to meet the people.  Press the flesh, as they say.  You know what?  They wanted us to take a photo, the three of us, just to sign.  That wouldn't be a bad idea, so it's faster, man.  I already told them what photo to use.  Oh, the three of us?  I already told them.  Sheiky baby.  This should be a better one.  That's a great one to sign.  Stupid Sheik is on it.  Maybe go to a convention, find the Iron Sheik, get him to sign it, too.  There you go.  Oh, that one.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's a great picture to sign.  That is.  It's one of the best pictures ever.  Okay.  That's what I told the guy. 
[02:35:30]  I actually forgot.  And then we could do the other thing.  A dumb little pissy pants.  No, no, no.  That's good.  I forgot about that.  I thought you meant the one we took for XM.  That's a...  Oh, yeah.  She was curly.  She was straightened out because they're full of piss.  They just slowly go straight out, just full of urine.  There's piss in his boots.  There's piss in his boots.  There's pissing.  That was a good kid's book.  What?  Piss in boots.  Wow, I can't believe all the people that showed up.  Really?  How long have you been in this business?  Well, uh...  You idiot.  The...  Sorry, Ian. 
[02:36:00]  Don't fire me before you.  It's okay.  You'll be all right.  Don't worry about it.  The RSVP list and the waiting list have already filled up completely in the first day.  Well, that's going to bring amazement into his fucking mind later today.  Nice.  Well, there's only three tickets for that.  Yeah.  But we are...  We're opening up the, like, upstairs area for people the day of, so everybody should just  come and...  I mean, we'll have plenty of room up there.  All right, good.  So if you show up, you're getting in?  Oh, yeah.  Very cool.  And we'll probably be moving people down to the floor because not everyone shows up 
[02:36:30]  from the RSVP list.  So you've still got options.  You've got options.  As we get close, we'll start announcing what some of the things we're going to do.  There's a couple of things we're working on, which I think will be entertaining.  It'll be fun.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We'll have a good time.  You know.  I'm going to do my Gregory Hines tap dance.  Nice.  Oh, I can't wait to see that.  I have been, yeah.  Yeah.  Big Gregory Hines fan.  I didn't know.  Is he alive?  No.  No.  He shouldn't be.  No idea.  So it's two weeks from today.  The Thanks for Nothing and Opie and Anthony Holiday event.  Yeah. 
[02:37:00]  Did you just roll your eyes?  Yeah.  Just because what...  Why?  Because the logic is just amazing to me.  Walks up to us all excited like a little kid.  I'm like, yes.  We've been doing this forever.  Yes.  We draw people, you idiot.  Forever.  I wanted to do a Thanksgiving play.  Do you?  Oh, that'd be nice.  Who would you play, Jimmy?  Who would you play?  I don't know.  Pilgrims and Indians?  Yeah.  The first Thanksgiving?  Pilgrim or an Indian.  We could all hold our scripts and fucking have like a headdress or a pilgrim hat.  Do you know that... 
[02:37:30]  Nice.  That is one of the events we're working on.  Are you kidding?  Oh, good.  I suggested it.  I didn't know it got through.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We're doing it.  Like a school play?  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, the first Thanksgiving.  Where everybody walks out.  Hi, it's the first Thanksgiving.  Yeah.  Oh, I was told nobody wanted to do it.  I kind of like that.  With some of...  No, we've cast already.  Yeah, with some of the people that you know and love.  Yeah?  Yeah.  From the opening anthony.  We can't announce all the cast members yet because...  Can we be in it?  Some will get upset.  Uh-huh.  Huh?  Do you want to be in it?  I want to be in it.  Hey, if you do. 
[02:38:00]  If Jim or Chip wants to be in it, like, sure.  Oh, we should...  Yeah.  I want to be in it.  I want to be in it.  You want to be in it, too?  I don't need a big part, but I want to show off my acting chops.  Yeah.  Do you want to be a pilgrim or an Indian?  I'd want to be a pilgrim.  All right.  Because they win.  Yeah.  I don't know what I'd want to be.  Obi, do you want to be in it?  No.  Okay.  You could be the humble narrator.  Yeah, I'll...  Oh, nah, right.  Maybe I could play both of something.  I'll run the whole stage.  Get it, Ryan.  I don't know.  Whatever.  Well, I mean, I think we could find spots for Chip, Uncle Paul. 
[02:38:30]  Yeah.  Ted Sheckler.  Yep.  Ted's a bit overact.  Yeah.  Can you play multiple roles?  Just change your hat.  Jim Norton.  And Jim Norton.  Yeah.  Just change your hat a lot.  Have some turkey.  It's delicious, you redskins.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh.  Sorry.  Someone's got...  That happens if I pick up granola. 
[02:39:00]  I just pick him up.  He picks up his granola and knocks his microphone right out of the holder.  We could do the Jocktober update.  I mean, I know Jocktober's over, but I...  Oh, I see.  It's your show.  Oh.  You asked what I liked.  I didn't know your show started in 9-20.  You asked what I liked.  You know, the show that wasn't supposed to be yours, which is now yours.  How did that happen?  Nobody saw that coming, did they?  I saw it coming from a mile away.  Right.  I love the...  You know what?  Go ahead. 
[02:39:30]  You're asking me so upset.  What?  Is this an obesity reference?  And it has to be said, and I apologize.  You apologize in advance, and now you're saying it.  It's bad, yeah.  It's going to be bad.  I love the fact that management finally realized that you guys weren't voicing the worst of the week.  Oh, he's going to be so pissed.  And let me tell you this.  Did you hear this one?  Oh, I heard that.  Yeah, yeah.  No, but you got it.  I knew the shenanigans.  Eric is going to be so pissed.  I knew the shenanigans that were going on.  Eric is going to be so pissed, and I'll tell you why.  Why?  Because Troy...  Yeah. 
[02:40:00]  Once it was said that, all right, Sam and E-Rock are, like, managed...  Rob Cross, he was like, so you guys aren't hosting anymore.  No, okay, you're not hosting.  It's done.  I played my role perfectly, by the way.  Well, E-Rock...  I was told by E-Rock to play my role, and I decided to play my role perfectly.  Okay, this is not...  Instead of being an asshole, but now I'm being an asshole.  This is not the way E-Rock paints it, even behind the scenes, to us.  I played my role perfectly.  I had to make believe that I didn't know what was going on from us.  I don't know.  You better explain.  We're going to.  Why don't you explain first, so... 
[02:40:30]  Well, I've been convinced for a very long time.  You know the wow guy who's amazed that people show up for our events?  I know he doesn't listen to our show whatsoever.  Hasn't heard a fucking minute of this thing in years.  And then the other guys are too busy running other channels.  So we're kind of, you know, that famous island thing we started at NEW.  Under the radar a little bit.  We're an island.  So the Worst of the Week countdown was voiced by Sam and E-Rock.  And now listeners everywhere are going, really?  I didn't know that.  And the reason they didn't know that was because Sam and E-Rock, on their own, decided to stop doing it. 
[02:41:00]  Oh, brilliant.  Because they're not getting paid enough and they work enough hours.  So why do it?  There wasn't one fan of the stupid minute of banter that E-Rock and me did before the bits that you actually wanted to hear.  So logically, they said, we don't need to voice this thing.  It kind of runs itself, you know, with the production and stuff.  So the way it happened, because this is E-Rock's show.  Like, I helped him host it and everything.  But E-Rock, this was his whole thing. 
[02:41:30]  And he was like, you know, we didn't get around to doing it this week.  So let's just put some production in.  And I go, okay, that sounds fine.  And the beauty is management didn't notice.  So you did it again, the next week.  And then it got to become a joke behind the scenes where we're like, how long is it going to take for them to realize, because, quote, they're supposed to be in charge of the channel, to realize that the guys aren't hosting it anymore.  And it went, how long?  Be honest.  Be honest.  Eight months.  Eight months.  And then finally, one of these idiots, because they're just all the same to me at this point, one of these idiots, quotes. 
[02:42:00]  That is brilliant.  Why didn't you guys, why didn't you host the worst of the week countdown this week, right?  Is this how it went down?  Yeah.  They went to E-Rock and said, and what did E-Rock say?  We didn't have time to get a studio this week.  This week.  He lied to him.  He said, because it was eight months, not one week.  I would have said, you know, here's, all right, time to let you in on this. 
[02:42:30]  But E-Rock decided to keep going.  And E-Rock decided to go with the lie.  And he lied and said, we didn't have time to grab a studio this week.  This week.  He went with the lie.  He just kept going.  Instead of at that point going, well, we thought, you know, you could even be vague.  We thought, you know, we don't really need to voice it anymore.  It seems like no one had any complaints about it.  But he decided to continue with the lie.  He is going to be so pissed.  Why is he going to be pissed?  E-Rock, because.  I brought up his little creepy lying spot. 
[02:43:00]  He thought.  It's not going to lead to a race, so who cares?  He's locked in.  He thought he had gotten away with it.  Yeah.  And I would have, too.  And then E-Rock came to me and was like, if anyone asked, just, you know, to say this.  I'm like, all right, no problem.  So they came up to me.  See, that's funny.  Because.  Does he like to shirk his responsibilities?  He loves it.  He loves shirking.  I mean, the ideas that he comes up with so he doesn't have to do work.  But the beauty is that those guys who supposedly are supposed to be paying attention, it took 
[02:43:30]  him eight months to realize.  But listen to the way.  Eight fucking months.  And the way E-Rock was trying to cover this up, too.  Troy knew about this.  And Troy likes to see the things blow up.  Like, he likes to see the conclusion of this.  Like, part of keeping this going, one would assume, was for the inevitability of, here's  the reveal.  So Troy was getting tired of waiting.  And this was like a couple weeks ago.  And he goes, Eric, let me just go down and tell him that you guys haven't been hosting.  He was like, Sam, can I? 
[02:44:00]  And I was like, yes.  I've been, I don't care.  Just go and do it.  Yeah.  You have enough shows.  Yeah.  You could have done this months ago.  What difference does it make to me?  And Eric goes, listen, Troy, it's fine with me, but Opie said, he doesn't want you doing  that.  And we go, what are you talking about?  We go, what?  And he goes, Opie talked to me.  And he said to not tell anyone about this.  Let's get him on the phone.  We should call him.  We already tried.  And you can get Troy in here to see if I'm exaggerating. 
[02:44:30]  That's exactly.  We have two numbers.  We need him on the air.  Well, I can't do anything except keep calling him.  I'm not yelling at you.  Oh, okay.  What are you doing?  He's not picking up the phone.  He's being sick.  Well, someone text him.  It's his fake sick day.  We announced that earlier.  Fake sick day.  Yeah.  Fake sick day.  We're all grown men.  No one gets sick anymore.  No.  You just work through it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Morning.  Fucking man up.  How happy are you?  Oh.  Look at it.  Look at how happy Troy is.  Smiling.  New happy Troy. 
[02:45:00]  Oh, I love this shit.  I love this shit.  Why do you love this shit?  Oh, it's just funny.  It's just the whole Eric thing.  Like, he thinks he's so slick.  And he just thinks he's like, you know, he can just maneuver people.  And he's like, and his go-to is always like.  Does he like moving people around like chess pieces?  Oh, yeah.  Like, he thinks he's like the mastermind.  The puppet master.  The Bobby Fischer.  And to that point, Rob Cross came to me, and he goes, so, Opie said, you and Eric don't 
[02:45:30]  need to really host the countdown for the next few weeks.  Well, that was me officially playing my role.  Well, I know.  I know.  Hold on a minute.  And Rob was-  Hello?  Hey, it's Colin Quinn.  How's it going?  Hi, Colin Fox.  How'd that happen?  Hi, Colin.  We were expecting someone else, but that's fine that you're on the line.  What's up, buddy?  I'm just calling because I drove home with Norton last night, and something really bugged  me all night, and I have to get it off my chest.  Sure.  All right.  I'm on my way to Elton.  You know, he's from the end.  Oh, no.  And he's got, like, you know, different people on the tour, and he hasn't changed the name. 
[02:46:00]  And I was just imagining him sitting with his manager going, I mean, it's about product  name recognition.  He's using all the shit, advertising firms, and thinking he's like a business magnet.  A business magnet, yes.  Your phone crapped out a little bit, but what you're saying is the anti-social tour  that Jimmy's doing, but he's got new comics coming in.  Two new comedians.  Two new guys.  Same name.  Same name.  That was not my choice, though.  I wanted to change the name.  No, you didn't.  I did. 
[02:46:30]  And my agent fought me on it, and I talked to the other guys about it, and they were  like, you know, it's fine.  Keep it.  First of all, he didn't talk to the other guys about it.  Second of all, you and your agent sat there, and you guys were using, like, horrible advertising  terminology.  Like, you know, it's branding.  And it's annoying.  My agent didn't say that.  He said branding?  Yes.  And you sat there and nodded sagely, like, oh, that makes sense.  No, I thought it was stupid.  Shut up.  Colin's calling in to call the shots, I think, on the show. 
[02:47:00]  Who's the new Colin?  You're right about him, but you were wrong about me.  But you did nail it with that dumb branding thing he said.  You don't like business, Jimmy?  No.  You're not a fan of business, Jimmy?  I don't like serious business, Jimmy, at all.  You think Jimmy's looking at the numbers behind the scenes now?  No, he's trying to.  He's just like being a dumb comedian, but he's trying to be like, oh, I mean, there's a certain  thing that actually crushes the numbers.  And he's like, you know, in the Southeast, obviously, we need a little more. 
[02:47:30]  You should, right?  Might need a little more advertising in the Southeast.  Yeah, it's really annoying.  Are you on your way to L.A.?  Yes, it ruined my whole night, as a matter of fact.  Good.  Why are you going to L.A., Colin?  I'm going to do a benefit out there.  Oh, nice.  You guys can't trash me.  It's a benefit.  What's the benefit for?  Peter Boyle Foundation.  Oh.  Peter Boyle?  Peter Boyle.  Exactly. 
[02:48:00]  He doesn't eat it.  He's dead.  What's the foundation for?  Like, what support?  Yeah, what illness?  The disease he died from.  I don't know what it was.  Yeah, what was it?  Colin doesn't know either.  Colin has no idea.  He doesn't know.  What a worm.  Just going out there because he thinks it'll make him a big shot.  You don't know the disease he died of?  You fucking worm.  You don't like to discuss it.  Why?  You don't like to discuss it?  Because he's scared we're going to blow up his gig.  No, he doesn't know.  He's flying out there to do the red carpet.  What a fucking weasel.  He has no idea. 
[02:48:30]  What did the disease affect?  I bet you they offered him a free airfare.  That's why he's going, oh, you know, he's going to fly out to the coast and do a benefit.  Fucking asshole.  Mr. Red Carp.  I don't think he knows.  No, he has no idea.  No, I don't know, but I do know that it's fatal.  So listen.  I would assume.  What did Peter Boyle die of?  Yeah.  Don't be rocked to look at a multiple myeloma.  Myeloma.  Yeah, it's a great song by the Kinks.  Oh, boy. 
[02:49:00]  Myeloma.  Myeloma.  I did the whole thing.  What is myeloma?  Is that like a little cancer?  At home at the end.  It can't be good.  The name of Chip's second album.  I do the whole thing.  It's cancer of plasma cells.  What?  Jesus.  A type of white blood cell, yeah.  I would hate to have that.  Wow, boy.  That must just be like, go fuck your immune system.  Jeez.  It's going to be a lot of laughs.  Sounds nice.  It's going to be a lot of laughs at this benefit.  A lot of myeloma jokes going on. 
[02:49:30]  Oh, my God.  Oh, heaven.  Are you flying business?  Yeah, I think so.  Is Virgin Atlantic business, right?  No, they have first and coach.  Shit.  Meaning.  They told me business.  Oh, maybe they don't consider that first.  Colin fucking made them fly him first.  Yeah.  I don't like the fact that Keith Robinson's flying first, and I'm not.  Only he's going to do.  But he had to throw that in yesterday. 
[02:50:00]  What's he going to do?  Your phone keeps cracking up.  I don't know what he's going to do, but I know he's like, yeah, because I take Continental  because of first.  And, of course, then I accused him of him and Norton of being Continental's foe, you  know, files that just love Continental.  Not so much anymore.  He's doing a benefit for sickle cell.  Oh, man, what?  And, you know, they didn't fly him first.  They flew him coach, and he upgraded with Miles, that fucking phony.  Once you see him like he's zipping off to the coast, importantly. 
[02:50:30]  Keith stinks.  All right, Colin.  So you don't like business, Jimmy, and you're going to LA.  That's all I have to say.  You were right, though, about my fucking dumb agent.  I really did fight him on that.  I didn't know if I wanted to call it the same thing.  But there's no harm in it.  It's like, what else do you call it?  Well, let me ask you this.  That's not a bad name, though.  What's that?  It's a good name.  It just bugs me that he's sitting there proud of his stupid product.  And first of all, you didn't fight him on it. 
[02:51:00]  You didn't come in with other choices for names, did you?  And if you did, we demand to hear them right now.  I didn't really.  I didn't know what to call it.  You got one in you.  Come on.  No, I didn't know.  Not one?  Alternative name?  I just like the names.  Four Friends Four.  Yeah.  The Happy Tour, because we're all not happy.  Yeah.  I didn't know.  No.  What's that?  It was 2012.  No.  Maniacal laugh. 
[02:51:30]  Well, he's great because he's telling us that he went in and fought him on it.  Yet, if I fought somebody else, I might come in with a couple of alternatives.  So there's one of two things happening here.  If he didn't fight him on it, and he's lying, or he has a couple of horrible names.  I love Colin.  He sure cuts to the chase, doesn't he?  I think he has a horrible name.  Come on, Jimmy.  I hope he has a horrible name.  I did.  I was going to call it long story short.  No, I did argue with him, but I didn't think we should call it anything. 
[02:52:00]  I thought we should just go in under our names.  But it just, I understand why.  Oh, that's really organic.  That's raw, man.  It's sarcastic.  Hey, man, you know, we have our own thing.  Shut up.  I didn't know what to call it.  What do you call it?  I don't know.  I'll have to have the listeners call it.  I'm sure that has a great idea.  Colin, you don't have an idea, though, either.  See?  Yeah.  Yeah, what was your idea?  Hey, if I was running the tour, I'd just sit down for 20 minutes and think of a couple  of things.  So quick to criticize, but I don't see you coming up and brainstorming here. 
[02:52:30]  Yeah, you're in the back of a black town car that you're charging a cancer charity for.  Fucking creep.  Instead of taking a cab yourself.  Hey, I'm paying for this.  You're paying for your own flight?  No, I'm paying for my own cab.  Oh, what a dope.  I was kidding.  I would have made them fly me first, first of all.  I think Colin's blowing out your candle, Jimmy, to make his little brother.  Yeah, I know what he's doing.  He just wants to brag that he's going to L.A. to do something and coming right back.  He's going to brag.  He's going to L.A.  Yeah, he kind of has a lame reason why he's calling, because he knows the L.A. info will 
[02:53:00]  get out in a casual conversation.  Yeah, we're doing a benefit.  Fly in, fly out.  Peter Boyle, you know, but it's not about this.  Some disease, I don't know.  Right.  That would make sense if it was 1952.  I'm bragging about going to L.A.  I wouldn't mention that Keith Robinson's going to L.A., too, would I?  When are you going?  Right now.  I mean, no, no, when are you coming back?  I'm running into 59th Street Bridge as we speak.  I'm coming back on Sunday night.  Oh, you're doing an L.A. weekend. 
[02:53:30]  Why, big shot?  What is there?  Is the benefit split over three nights?  No, I'm staying with a friend, probably David Spade.  Oh.  Are you really?  Yeah.  That's fucking nice.  Yeah.  He's living the level of dream.  I might as well just, you know, be in on that.  Yeah, mooch off him.  Yeah, why not?  Hope to meet some celebrity friends, convince them to do the same.  How many wigs does David Spade have?  Oh.  I'll tell you about the time.  Okay.  I'll tell you about the time I went to Spade's house and he was having a big party at Jennifer 
[02:54:00]  Anderson's and I went there kind of expecting her to be like, I think I told you this.  And I thought she'd be like, hey, come.  Like, I thought we always had a connection.  And she just looked at me like, hi, friend.  Like, she didn't even know who I was.  Oh.  Oh.  Yeah.  My friend.  Why would you expect her to know who you are?  Exactly.  Because I met her like four times.  Oh.  Like, just looked at her or actually met her and said some words?  Oh, yeah.  But it was kind of, you know, there was a time when she knew my name. 
[02:54:30]  You guys have to understand.  With a guy like me, there's a time when people know my name and then a couple of years later  they don't know it again.  No.  Then they know it again.  No, there's a time people know your name.  It's for five seconds when someone says, this is Colin Quinn.  And then as soon as you turn around, it evaporates like mist, like an odor.  What's that called, boss?  I've never made this call.  Makes five of us.  I'll let you get back to what I have an awful subject you were doing. 
[02:55:00]  Oh, it's terrible.  Terrible.  Thank you.  All right, Colin.  Hey, Opie, we had the big call you guys were expecting when I barged in.  Apparently, he didn't call.  Oh, no.  E-Rock.  It was E-Rock.  You know what?  You love E-Rock.  And E-Rock decided to take a fake sick day today, so we're bothering him now.  What a phony.  Yeah.  He didn't even have the, uh, scratchy voice, like, I can't make it in, boss.  Yeah, he's being defiant.  Sounded right as rain.  What I love, though, is anyone else takes a fake sick day, we don't even think about it. 
[02:55:30]  But with E-Rock, we have to beat him up for it.  Yeah.  There's a problem.  And we know he's not here, because you walk in and the building, he's breathing a sigh  of relief.  See, because he's heavy.  Because he's a big boy.  The elevators are faster.  Everything just works better.  Sound quality's better.  All right, how many things are you going to read?  It was good, man.  All right, Colin.  See you, man.  Come on, guys.  Have a good trip.  Colin Quinn.  I'm not on that level with Colin.  That's so funny that he fucking picked that out.  He's such a smart guy.  If he picks up on the littlest fucking thing, and we'll just drive it right into your gut, 
[02:56:00]  Troy?  But Pete's bad at naming things, so I didn't know if I wanted to, but I kind of went with  him.  Yeah?  Yeah.  He's done a lot of tours.  Antisocial's fine.  Yeah.  No more network.  Just antisocial comedy.  That's good.  Social's a big word out there these days.  Yeah.  Have a sociable.  That was my favorite cookie.  I don't think I'm getting my soup.  Shit.  You want some out of the bottom of my balls?  Some fucking, some nice fucking hep C soup. 
[02:56:30]  I rarely go with the soup thing, but I was figuring, ah, go with some soup.  And then, I don't know, I asked for about nine, I guess.  Oh, it gets dropped.  My yogurt?  That's a long time ago, man.  And then all of a sudden it didn't get you.  Where's my soup?  Kenny, what happened?  I wasn't ready yet.  Oh.  Well, unless you want to take it to go.  Oh, boy.  Put that to the, I was kidding.  Make that coffee to go.  Make the coffee to go with the fucking, what should I do, Kenny?  It's ready right now?  I say we get soup, and then we'll just do a little extra radio so you can enjoy your 
[02:57:00]  soup today.  What?  I'll fucking be speeding down the road, one cup of soup in my hand, the steering wheel  in the other.  Yeah, like a real cup of soup trip.  Troy Kwan.  Back to you, sir.  I'll take it now.  Yeah, why not?  Come on.  Troy Kwan, back to you.  Come on, Bill Tattles.  You're talking about how slick Eric is.  Yeah, you've got to get your energy back up.  I apologize.  I really thought that was Eric calling in, which would have been perfect for this rant.  This is just another fucking big barrel-chested lunk. 
[02:57:30]  The slickness of Eric, who thinks he's got one over on everybody.  Like, I was just saying that Rob Cross was like, yeah, so Opie said that you and Eric  aren't going to be hosting anymore.  And in Eric's head, he was thinking, yeah, Rob Cross is going to think this is coming  from Opie.  He's playing his role.  And the mastermind, Eric Nagel, is just sitting back.  And I go, yeah, I guess that's what he said.  I guess Eric used me, huh?  And then...  Well, you're his go-to, by the way.  Then Rob goes, yeah, so I guess that means Eric obviously asked Opie to say that for him. 
[02:58:00]  I go, yeah.  Oh.  Yeah, that's right.  Like, he saw right through Eric Nagel's slick plan.  His clever ruse.  I decided to play my role knowing I would just blow it up on the air, by the way.  It makes it better.  It's great.  And then I told...  Because he must have been scratching his head like, wow, he's being really cool about  this.  No.  I knew I'd bring it up on the air.  And then I was telling you that Eric told Troy that he couldn't tell anybody in management  about this because Opie said not to.  Remember when he said that?  Oh, yeah. 
[02:58:30]  No.  Yeah, but he does that all the time.  I just told Eric I'd play my...  I would play the role and make believe I didn't know that you guys haven't hosted it in eight  months.  I asked Sam.  I said...  Knowing that I would say it on the air, which makes it way, way worse.  I said...  Sam, I said...  Especially when he's taking a fake sick day.  How many times do you think Eric says, oh, Opie said this...  Because that's the conversation ender right there.  Do you know what I mean?  Like, if it's like...  If something's going on, it's like, no, no, no, this, whatever.  And he likes to just throw that around.  And it's like...  Eric's favorite two words. 
[02:59:00]  Or, Opie said...  What the...  I barely talked, Eric.  Or his four-word response to getting out of something is, you want to ask Opie?  As if to say, look, I talked to Opie.  If you want to talk to him, go ahead.  But this is the shit that's going down.  Well, more importantly, management's now onto this.  Onto?  They become grossly aware of it.  See, the point was...  Maybe not, though.  Because they don't listen to the show.  Is anyone listening today?  I would think...  I would...  Probably now, yeah. 
[02:59:30]  I mean, if...  Are you going to get in trouble for this?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because the problem is that Troy would have just gone to one person and said it.  Who gets in trouble?  Eric?  I get in a little trouble and Eric gets in more trouble.  But you enjoyed that I brought this up.  Eric gets in more trouble.  Oh, I see.  I'm willing to...  You're willing to get in a little trouble knowing how fucking much trouble Eric's going  to get in?  Yeah, and how...  Yeah, yeah.  Eric...  That's fair.  Eric, like, had to...  This was, like, his thing.  Like, he had protected this.  Like, this was his scheme.  Whereas the entire time, I was like, Eric, just... 
[03:00:00]  Why would he continue to lie?  Just tell him.  I don't...  That's the thing.  Because he loves to scheme.  He loves to think that he's got one over on everyone.  Don't you think at that point you would kind of, like, spin and go, well, we...  You know, a while ago, you know, we decided to do it without us hosting and it works.  So we just kept going with that.  I told...  I swear to God.  I told Troy months ago.  Troy was like, can I just go tell Rob just to see what he says?  And I was like, yeah.  Months ago.  I was like, yeah, just go tell him.  I don't care.  Just tell him what's going on.  Maybe Iraq will be...  Laugh this off.  The best part is Iraq isn't smart enough to realize that in the end they wouldn't have 
[03:00:30]  cared anyway.  But now they're going to care that he lied.  Especially since it came up on the air.  Since he just lied and lied and lied.  The point is, if you just do it, but you never lie about it.  Like, you didn't ask, so I didn't tell you.  That's one thing.  And you can kind of worm your way out of it.  But if he said, I noticed you didn't host this week.  And Eric's response was, yeah, that was a one-week thing.  Not...  We haven't done it in months.  I didn't...  Just to see.  And we like it this way.  Because they could have looked that up. 
[03:01:00]  Yeah.  Is it in the system?  I don't know.  I would...  Kind of.  It's weird, the system, because you guys were on Dilette, and then you came here, and  now you're on a system called Profit.  So some of your stuff is in Dilette, and some of it's in Profit.  Everything that runs through the weekend is in Profit, and those files are recorded over  for the next week.  Just in case you need to know, people.  Well, I'm trying to explain.  Well, because you said, is it in the system?  So Eric keeps all that stuff...  Is it in the system meant yes or no? 
[03:01:30]  Yeah, but no, but the Profit is better, because it makes money.  Troy just gave us lower ratings than Cinemagic.  Sorry.  You're right.  I apologize.  Everybody was into the ERAC thing, and then immediately clicked.  Oh, yeah.  There was a lot of clicking going on.  Well, I was trying to say that Eric has a lot of...  During the Profit discussion.  Profits versus Dilette.  But now I'm interested.  What is the technological difference between the two?  You mean Dilette and Profit?  Yeah.  Oh.  Dilette versus Profit.  If I would have just gone and told management...  I'm team Dilette, by the way.  Are you?  All the fucking way, right, Troy?  Troy seems like a Profit.  Troy knows.  I'm a little bit more... 
[03:02:00]  Do you really want to break this down?  You're a serious guy, so you have to be team Profit.  I'm going to tell you what.  Dilette is good because you can store more, but Profit is a better automation system.  How does that work?  Anyway, back to Eric.  How does that work?  I understand.  How could it be a better automation system?  It plays like iTunes, where you hit play and it just goes.  And how did Dilette play?  Exactly.  What does that play like?  Fucking something...  If I would have just went and told management when it happened, they would have just been  pissed and then they would have to pick up... 
[03:02:30]  Shut your goddamn pipe up!  Where are you at with Occupy Wall Street?  You got conspiracies on this one?  No, not really.  It's just...  Silly to you?  What do you got?  It is silly.  I mean, like I said before, it seems like a good cause and I understand it, but then the  people that are representing it are people like our intern.  That's just...  How do you take that seriously?  I heard Matt's out.  He doesn't believe in it anymore.  He doesn't anymore, but if I...  That means he can't find a girl to finger.  I want to stop you from asking him about it because he just brings everybody into this 
[03:03:00]  Matt zone that nobody finds entertaining, so just take my word for it.  He was a one-hit wonder, that guy.  Holy shit.  I'll try to tell him that.  All right, anything else on E-Rock?  You good?  He's...  Let me tell you what else on E-Rock.  He's not answering the phone, that's for sure.  He is going to be furious.  He may threaten to quit.  He is going to be so pissed at this.  He's going to threat, but he's not going to do it.  He's not going to do it, no.  But he's got to cover your own ass.  You can't continue to lie when the lie is being exposed in front of your face.  You started the day by calling him at six o'clock in the morning.  Well, turn off your phone if you're sick. 
[03:03:30]  Then throughout the show, you announce that Eric Dagle from SiriusXM is taking a fake sick  day, which even though he has the sick days, like that's supposed to be an unsaid thing.  Like management doesn't want us to specifically take fake sick days.  Now, tomorrow, the best part of this whole thing, tomorrow Eric's going to have to walk  around and make him believe he's still under the weather.  Yeah.  It's going to be so awkward for everybody.  And he'll try to use reverse psychology.  He'll be like, hey, how you doing?  Well, I guess nobody believes me, so I'm fine.  I was faking it.  And he'll just trudge heavily. 
[03:04:00]  Sun, sun, sun, sun.  I'll be like trudging tomorrow.  He's so sick all the time anyway.  He always has diarrhea.  Do you know what I mean?  Always.  He's always like, I gotta go to the bathroom.  Because I used to sit in there with him.  He's like, I gotta go shit.  Like it comes on him so quick.  Like how does this shit come on that fucking dick?  Do you think his lips have a weird coating on them sometimes?  Look at his lips.  Sometimes he has like a dry, crusty coating.  Oh, really?  Yeah, sometimes there's a coating. 
[03:04:30]  Sometimes he's...  Sometimes he seems to get glazed.  Maybe it's a sausage casing.  This seems to be Troy's favorite subject.  What do you mean E-Rock's lost sometimes?  Listen, this is...  This is all because E-Rock will not answer his phone.  Do you know what Troy was doing before the show started today?  He was ranting about E-Rock.  Do you know what Troy was doing after the show ended yesterday?  Ranting about E-Rock.  Because...  Rob Cross was in the room.  Troy is ranting.  Mars was in there.  Troy is ranting.  Weren't you guys friends?  We are friends.  And if I wasn't friends with him, it would probably be a lot worse. 
[03:05:00]  But it's just when you work with him...  What's the problem?  There's some things that are just so infuriating.  I mean, my blood boils.  Let's go.  Go.  Quick.  I feel bad because he's not here to defend himself.  Yeah, but it's his choice not to answer the phone.  He thinks he's getting one over on us by not answering his phone.  That's right.  He's trying to call him one more time.  This is the only reason we're doing this.  He just...  Go ahead, Troy.  I don't know if I would open this valve.  Let it out.  Well, what's the...  There's a lot of stuff you don't like.  Sam knows.  Open the blowhole.  Well, Troy... 
[03:05:30]  Sam's going to get it out of you.  All right.  Here's your...  Let me say one thing.  Okay.  It's the laziness that you were talking about.  It's just...  But he seems like he's busy all the time.  I know.  I'm not even trying to...  But you just...  That's what I see.  That he's busy all the time.  He's always doing something.  But you just...  You walk into his office and he's eating.  No, no, no.  That's not...  He's on Facebook.  Troy described it differently than eating.  What?  What's he doing?  Feeding.  Oh, feeding. 
[03:06:00]  Yes, I heard that.  He feeds.  What annoys you the most when you walk in and see him doing like, of course he's doing  that.  Because I need him to do something.  I legitimately need something from him for this.  For the channel.  For the show.  And he just has this...  And you're just like, really, dude?  Like, really?  Come on, man.  Like, I need this.  And it just constantly goes on.  And there's just constant shortcuts.  And there's an idea that came up that was obviously not a good idea at our meeting. 
[03:06:30]  And everybody said, this is not a good idea, Eric.  And he's like, okay.  And he takes his pen like this.  Like, here's his notes that he has.  And he's like, okay, guess we're not doing that.  Oh, like, really dramatically scribbles it out.  And everybody there is like, dude, no, that's not a good idea.  Let's not do that.  And he's angry about it.  Instead of just being like, okay, cool.  You know, that's cool.  I understand what you're saying.  Why was he so angry?  Because it was his idea and it's not being used. 
[03:07:00]  Was it a bad idea?  Terrible idea.  Terrible.  Some people don't like Troy, though.  There's definitely Team E-Rock people out there.  That's fine.  Like, fuck you, Troy, you faggot.  I'm on Team E-Rock.  I'm a Team E-Rock guy.  I'm on Team Serious.  Nice visual dickhead.  People just don't, some people don't like him.  Yeah, that's fine.  I'm okay with that.  Troy sucks a dick.  Okay.  That's someone who likes him.  Very good.  Anything else?  Oh, they're calling him Troy Yawn.  Oh, that's probably the good white prophet stuff.  Instead of Troy Kwan, Troy Yawn.  That's a good one. 
[03:07:30]  That's a good one.  That's kind of funny.  Eric.  Did Troy act more like a dumped girlfriend?  Oh!  Damn!  Wow!  From the sickbed!  Wow!  So keep him down.  Sex man in the house.  A dumped girlfriend.  That's a roundhouse from the sickbed.  Damn!  Exactly.  The sex man sickbed.  By the way, E-Rock's voice sounds much better.  Yeah.  Well, you know, you rest a little in the morning.  You feel better.  Fit as a fiddle.  Have some opposite.  Have a little brand. 
[03:08:00]  You can sweat it out.  E-Rocker, you're doing a fake sick day, right?  Yeah, I'm sick.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Yeah.  That's all you gotta hear.  In the transcripts, that looks good.  That looks good.  Sure, a couple calls.  I was told I didn't sound sick enough earlier when you called me at 6.13 this morning, so  I figured I'll throw it on now.  Fuck you, Troy.  All you do is fucking stare at me and pay attention to every little thing I do, and my day goes  where I never think of Troy unless he's complaining about how I'm not paying attention to him. 
[03:08:30]  Oh, shit!  You're like a homo for him.  I'm gay Troy.  I'm gay Troy.  I love E-Rock.  You're gay free rock.  Hi, Eric.  Hi.  Eric, date me.  I want Eric to date me.  Well, it's hard to ignore him because there's so much that happens as a result of Eric.  Like what?  Well, one of the benefits of working on a show like this, I think everybody here would  agree with this statement, is you get to get autographs and pictures with celebrities. 
[03:09:00]  Sure.  Yeah, sure.  You work with them every day.  Eric will, when there's a celebrity in here, he will have 50 things on display for celebrities.  That drives me nuts.  It's all laid out like a buffet.  And the celebrity comes out and he's just going through it and he has to get autographs  for his wife.  He has to get autographs for his cousin.  He has to get autographs for this.  He's not getting them for his cousin.  For his nephew. 
[03:09:30]  Nephew.  No, he's not.  I don't believe that.  And it's just like, so now we have gotten in trouble and we are not allowed to get crackdown  on the staff.  Uh-huh.  And it's because of, it's because of this.  He'll have action figures all on display.  50 action figures.  He has 50.  He has printouts.  He has printouts of like a horrible print picture.  Like from a computer?  Yes.  A computer picture.  And it's, the markers are all there lying and he has the little tag on it says, sign 
[03:10:00]  to this person, sign to this person.  Oh boy.  And you're like, who the fuck are these people, Eric?  But see, this is why, I don't, I'm not obsessed with Eric, but it's just like, this affects  everything.  This affects things here.  So if I want an autograph, they're going to say, talent's going to be like, no, fuck  you.  It's ruined for the whole show.  No, it's not ruined.  It's not ruined at all.  And you're not getting autographs for your nephew.  Every fucking autograph, it always has to go to your nephew.  Well, see, I have kids in my family that I actually like, Troy. 
[03:10:30]  What's our why?  I'm not getting them autographs.  So I take care of, yeah, because you don't give a shit about your family.  So that's why.  Oh, personal, the personal gloves.  How would you know what I care if I care about my family or not?  I care about E-Rock, not my family.  Yeah, because I'm gay, Troy.  Yeah.  Hi, Eric.  See, he stares at me.  He obsesses over me.  You know, every little detail about my day.  He gets shit signed for his nephew.  I don't think twice about him.  Do you wish he lost weight so he'd be more attractive? 
[03:11:00]  I wish he'd just lose weight because he's fat and miserable.  How many months did you try to get me to drink that green lawn crap that you come in every morning?  Look how healthy I'm drinking.  Look at me.  Look how great I look.  Do you want to compare bodies?  Really, Eric?  Do you want to go down this road?  I'd love to see that.  Let's compare bodies.  Really?  I mean, let's take off our shirts.  Yeah!  I think we get all of these with this.  Let's see those big ball of titties.  Hi, Eric. 
[03:11:30]  The what?  The big bologna titties.  Oh, shit.  Really?  I mean, do you want to go down this road?  That's harsh.  So a bacon, egg, and cheese is better than a fucking green drink.  Wait, Troy.  Are you saying that there should be like a swimsuit competition at the Hard Rock Cafe?  Oh!  What an idea.  Hi, Eric.  Oh, Eric.  I've been watching you all day.  Let's do it.  Fuck yeah, Eric.  Let's do it.  Let's compare.  Let's compare bacon, egg, and cheese and green drink every morning.  Let's see how it affects you differently. 
[03:12:00]  Okay, one, I don't eat bacon, egg, and cheese.  And number two, you just want to see me with my shirt off again.  I do!  I do, because you've got big bologna titties.  Oh.  Titties.  Hit him with a mo.  How are you guys friends?  I like it.  He's all right.  I don't know how we're friends.  What?  I don't know how we're friends.  I don't know how we're friends.  When we came over there to Sirius, Troy was Mr. Positive, Mr. Why are you guys all so miserable?  Why do you hate management?  You know, complaining about everything. 
[03:12:30]  You guys, we'll turn this around.  We're so happy.  Then what happened?  Six months later, a year later, Troy's a complete piece of shit.  Oh!  Well, I'm still happy.  Wow.  I mean, I'm fine.  I just, I haven't really had the opportunity up to that point to work with you.  Oh, he's blaming his misery.  Wait.  No, I'm not blaming it all on him, but, you know.  No, he's blaming the rest on the show.  That's okay.  I didn't blame, look.  Hey.  Look, we.  I, when you have to work with you, some, and, and the way you behave and the way you 
[03:13:00]  respond to things, it sometimes is infuriating, Eric.  Just ruin the autograph stuff for this whole staff?  Yes, the whole staff.  Wow.  Eh, it wasn't me, but okay.  Go ahead.  Who was it?  Who else is putting 50 things on display?  It was another employee at this company who was showing off something, got in trouble,  and decided to name me and somebody else.  Oh.  Who?  Tell us who.  Wait, who?  Name names.  Name names.  Names.  Who?  And what were they showing off?  And to who?  Yeah.  Name names.  Names.  Uh, what? 
[03:13:30]  Who, who the other person on our show was?  Yeah, the whole thing.  No, of course.  Uh, that would be Jim Norton.  Oh.  Oh, no.  Now Eric just stepped in a fucking pile of steaming shit.  What was I showing off?  The what?  I couldn't hear you.  I don't know what you're saying.  Yeah, you just, what was he showing off?  No, the, the, there was somebody else, um, at this company that was showing, I guess,  photos that they had with somebody, and, uh.  Didn't you just name that somebody?  No. 
[03:14:00]  The, uh, it rubbed some people.  Oh, you were kidding.  No, no, I'm not kidding.  But then why did you just say Jim Norton?  What was I showing to who?  Oh, no, no, Jim, no, you misheard me.  Jim wasn't showing off anything.  There was somebody else at the company who was doing this.  And we said, who was it?  And you said Jim Norton.  Yeah.  No, no, no, no, no.  No, yes, you did.  All right, but he's going to tell us.  Yes, you did, Briss.  Yes, you did.  We misunderstood his saying.  If you stop yelling, I'll start over.  Yo, what did you mean?  Wow.  He's regulating today. 
[03:14:30]  Grass, balls, legos.  Yeah, that's what we call him.  It must be his low-grade fever he has today.  He's delirious.  He's a little delirious.  All right.  Sex man is burning up.  He's got a 99.5 today.  Remember, feed a cold, starve a walrus.  All right, don't hang up.  Come on, finish, please.  Yeah, because we're confused now.  Yeah, now we think you're goofing on Jimmy.  Yeah, start over.  No, no, no, no, not goofing on Jimmy at all. 
[03:15:00]  All right, start over, because something got lost.  Yes, yes.  Somebody else at this company had some photos up that rubbed upper management the wrong way  that they were promoting, that they were meeting all these people.  That person got in trouble.  And then, to get themselves sort of out of trouble, said, well, there's other people  who were worse than me.  Oh.  And without being asked, volunteered my name and Jim's name.  Oh, so who was this person that did this?  That I'm not going to say.  Come on, give us a name. 
[03:15:30]  Are they from Talent?  I can't hear what he said.  Are they from the Talent Department?  I can't say anything.  Oh, come now.  You could say it.  Who was it?  Sam, do you know who it is?  No.  Come on, Iraq.  You can't do that without names.  Yeah, who was it?  No, that's fine.  Give us a hint.  No, I can't.  I'm not going to.  Why?  You know who it is, and they sold you out, so why the fuck wouldn't you just...  Right.  Yeah.  Because I'm not going to do it on the air like a bitch, like Sam did with the Countdown 
[03:16:00]  and everything else.  Who, by the way, had a big hand in that?  What are you talking about?  Opie just said it on the air, not me.  I didn't say shit.  Oh, shit.  I didn't say shit.  Yeah, don't call me a bitch out on the air.  Opie said you haven't done it in my...  It's on the radio.  I didn't say shit.  God damn.  Travis is in the room just trying to find nuts to kick.  It's crazy.  It's a crazy day in here.  He just doesn't want that brought up.  I know.  It's hilarious. 
[03:16:30]  He's his friend, man.  This is crazy.  Oh, I see.  Okay.  So that person...  Wait, can I see the name?  Yeah, but...  Don't say it.  So wait.  So let's just say this person, whoever she is, she got in trouble for having photos up.  I was nice to her, too.  There's a veiled thread at the bottom.  Wait, so I was nice to her.  It happens.  It happens.  I don't care if she complained about me or not.  Was she complaining about me or trying to get out of it by raising other examples? 
[03:17:00]  Who is she?  I tried to get out of it by raising other examples.  Okay.  Well, the reason is...  Do you know her person?  I know who she is.  Yeah.  I know her.  I do take photos with people, even people who aren't on this show.  Correct.  Yes, I do.  Correctamundo.  You're also talent.  Yeah, but it's like, yeah, it's just something I've been doing.  And there's sometimes that Eric feels that he's at the same level that you are.  Are you talking about with the nephew autographs and all that stuff?  Well, I mean, just like when you have 50 things on display, it's like, really, dude?  Really?  Do you need this? 
[03:17:30]  Is it 50?  Really?  No one's paying attention to me?  Really?  What does that mean?  I don't know.  I don't get that one.  He's trying to be funny.  What does that mean?  It's past 10 o'clock.  Isn't it time to go?  Oh.  Oh.  I think he's right.  Sex bagel is regulating today.  Ooh.  He really is.  He's on the motherfucker right now.  So why don't you guys officially end your friendship?  I mean, whatever.  It's kind of silly that you're kind of friends.  But wait, Troy, let me, I'm sorry, Iraq, who did this person complain to? 
[03:18:00]  Um, you know, I'm not, I'm not 100% sure everyone that was involved with it.  Um, I know it was brought up to that person, and that person gave up names.  Jesus.  I hate this place.  It was, it was given, uh, well, no one said anything.  I mean, it's not like, you know, one person.  Was it to Bladder?  Uh, I don't, I don't believe so.  Was it to Gary?  No, no, no, it was higher than that. 
[03:18:30]  Eric.  Was it to Scott?  Eric the Ratnagel.  Mm-hmm.  This was like a couple weeks ago, right?  Like, this was a while back.  What are you talking about?  Eric, wasn't it, like, it wasn't like this week or something?  No, no, no.  This was, uh, about three weeks ago.  Okay, so, I mean, if nothing's changed in your world.  I'm not worried about it, I'm just curious as to who, yeah, no, nothing, I'm not concerned about it.  I'm curious as to who they said it to.  I've never, I've heard nothing.  Mm-hmm. 
[03:19:00]  Maybe because they knew, you know, it's a bunch of bullshit.  Jimmy Norton is a shite.  Honorable man.  I'd just like to do it.  Yes, of course.  And Eric's got to take care of his nephew.  Well, Eric, different story.  That is kind of honing in on, you know.  But at least he's good to his family.  I mean, you guys got to give him that, so.  He's not good to you?  No.  No, he's all right.  He's fine.  What about as a co-worker?  It's difficult as a co-worker.  Oh.  At times.  Eric, want to defend that?  No, because it's not about him. 
[03:19:30]  It's a team.  Troy tries to make everything about him.  What?  How?  How do I make everything about me?  That's not good.  You don't take my request seriously.  You know, when I ask you to get something, you just sit there, oh, okay, well, get to it  when I get to it.  Because you come in and cry wolf every time.  Hey, can I go do this or do that?  And it's a load of bullshit while Sam's standing next to you laughing knowing that it's a bunch  of bullshit.  This sounds like a guy that could have made it in.  You come in.  Sounds great.  A lot of energy.  Actually, he's full of piss and vinegar, isn't he? 
[03:20:00]  I haven't heard this much energy since he came in for Jocktober that time, all angry.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, this sounds like a guy that could just make it in, I guess.  How do you feel about Sam, Eric?  About Sam?  What?  Denying that he was part of the countdown thing?  Well, just his part of this whole thing.  Did you hear the conversation before you called in?  No, I just got a bunch of texts saying, hey, Sam's outing you on the air.  You better call in.  How come you could see the text, but you couldn't hear the phone right? 
[03:20:30]  I turned the phone off.  I didn't say I wasn't part of the countdown thing.  I told the entire story, and I told the story of when Troy wanted to go tell Rob, and I said  it was fine with me, and you said you can't tell Rob because Opie said not to.  And Opie looked at me like I had three heads when I told him that that was your response.  Of course he did.  He's not going to accept responsibility.  Talking about the man with three stones.  Opie!  Oh, shit. 
[03:21:00]  I care so much about this.  I'm playing Angry Birds right now.  Yeah, it's 10.03.  Keep it going.  Oh!  Shit, Nate.  It is fucking E-Rog.  He is guns blazing.  What a set of balls.  He doesn't come in today.  Apparently, whatever.  He gets called up at the end of the show, and then he's like, hey, it's 10.03.  Why don't you out?  A lot of balls in the old Nagel Dome.  Oh, my God.  Nagel Dome.  Nagel Dome, right.  The set of Nagel balls on you today.  Amazing.  For the record, I didn't say shit.  What are you talking about?  I didn't say shit.  Eric, listen to the replay and draw your own conclusions. 
[03:21:30]  I didn't say shit.  I got a bunch of texts saying you better call in.  Sam's talking and out of you about stuff.  Yep.  Out of you.  And I called in.  Yep.  Sam again.  Listen to the replay.  I had nothing to do with it.  Sam Bo.  I would encourage all.  I did nothing but tell the truth.  All right.  So Troy and Iraq are...  We're friends again.  We're fine.  You're fine again?  Eh, whatever.  But you think Iraq's selfish behavior has gotten a lot of people in Dutch, kind of? 
[03:22:00]  You think so?  I thought you guys had to go home.  Is it a time to call in today?  Yeah, it is.  I would concur.  Eric, will you be in tomorrow?  Enough of this drivel.  What?  You going to be in tomorrow or is this going to be a two-day fake sickness?  Well, I never took a Friday off, so let me see how that goes.  Oh!  Oh!  Threats!  In your face!  Wow.  Wow.  The management's going to go, wow, things kind of run just like they do when he's here 
[03:22:30]  and when he's not.  Yeah, absolutely.  Get rid of him.  Eric skews this, so it's going to be like, because we talked about him a bunch on the  show today, it's going to be like one of those, like, wow, you know, if I'm all they  talk about when I'm gone, obviously the show can't function without me.  That's true.  Four hours in depth, I guess so.  I see.  Holy shit.  Wow.  He is really, he's really something today.  Is it the fever?  Eric?  Is it the what?  Is it the fever?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, the fever.  So you're willing to admit you took a fake one today? 
[03:23:00]  No, I took a sick day.  Yeah, a fake sick day, though, right?  No, a real sick day.  I had a sick day.  He's going to get in trouble for that, too.  Why?  You're not supposed to, just because you have...  You're not allowed to admit fake sick days.  You know, every single person in this company does it?  Yeah, you're not supposed to admit having...  It's like a don't ask, don't tell.  Sick days are not vacation days.  Right.  You're there fucking lollygagging.  Yeah.  How many fake sick days do you allow? 
[03:23:30]  Oh, my God.  Roland just blew up Eric's spot, hardcore, in the other room.  Oh, shit.  And I'm not taking...  I'm not going to say that on the air and catch the blame for that.  Roland just blew up his spot.  Of course, you've got to bring it to everyone's attention.  Of course he does.  Get in here, Roland.  Because people are talking to my ear, wanting me to be, you know...  The bad guy?  No.  If you want to share it with people...  Oh, come on, Roland.  Get in here.  Roland just...  Eric, Roland just outed what your plans are for this afternoon.  Oh, shit.  That's right.  And if you think Ferris Bueller had a good day, I'd like to hear what Eric's got planned. 
[03:24:00]  How do you have plans?  Wait.  Eric's got plans for his sick day?  They're going crazy.  How do you have plans if you're not at work?  Travis is dying.  Roland's got his hands up in the air.  Liam's in there cracking up.  Tell Roland to come in.  Roland, come on in here.  Oh, Roland.  It's too late now.  Oh, God, I was trying to get out of here, but this is compelling.  Now I've got to know what E-Rock...  It just means we get to go home early tomorrow.  That's true.  Look at it that way.  Here comes Roland.  I've got to know.  Here comes Roland.  Here comes Roland.  Apparently now E-Rock took the day off. 
[03:24:30]  A sick day.  But now you have some information about what E-Rock's plans might be now later this afternoon.  And before you say, another one of E-Rock's friends.  Very strange how your friends do this to you.  E-Rock, what do you think of your friends?  He's going to the doctor.  This is bullshit, because this is why I am E-Rock's friend and not any of...  Because E-Rock's quote-unquote friends tell me things in my ears because they know that  I don't give a fuck.  I'll just say it.  Yeah.  Roland, say it.  Roland, where's it going?  You had everyone jumping up and down the other room. 
[03:25:00]  Say it.  Just fucking say it.  We're going to the Cunna Brian taking today.  E-Rock, you're going to the Cunna Brian.  You're going to the Cunna, E-Rock?  The cat's out of the Cunna Brian.  You're so excited that he's going to the Cunna Brian.  You're his friend.  He's going to the Cunna taping with sick Eric.  Wait, you're going with Eric?  Oh. 
[03:25:30]  Yeah.  Eric, you've got some fucked up friends.  I've got to tell you.  I'm a publicist for the management.  Where is the Cunna taping?  Is it Radio City?  Beacon.  Oh, what time?  You have to be there before two.  So you're taking a half day?  No, sir.  But you might have to go home sick.  I have to be a publicist.  I happen to be there with celebrities.  E-Rock, comment?  He's still online.  E-Rock?  Yeah, I'm here.  E-Rock, comment?  E-Rock?  E-Rock? 
[03:26:00]  All right.  You going to Cunna?  Sure.  Yeah?  Yeah.  You've got to be there.  You're feeling a little better than you were this morning, then?  It's just...  A little better?  Ah, yes.  My brother.  You had the worst friends, Eric.  They are rat outs.  They're just horrible.  Yep.  Well, I did tell Travis...  I wonder where they get that from.  Are they...  Do you think they're going to...  That you're going to get in trouble for this?  You know what?  At this point, who cares?  Ah, I love how everyone has the same opinion. 
[03:26:30]  But, Eric, I mean, they haven't given you a raise in so long.  It doesn't matter.  It's worth it.  The least you could do is do fake sick days and go to fucking Conan.  Why don't we get...  Conan wouldn't come in?  Did we try?  Yeah, I tried.  He's doing zero press.  Why is he here?  Nah, you know what?  At this point, fuck Conan O'Brien.  Enough already.  Enough already.  Really.  Jesus, enough with that stupid guy.  His stupid red hair and his dumb fucking...  Fucking cowl like him fucking had it with that asshole.  Oh, your tickets are ready, too.  I ain't fucking going. 
[03:27:00]  Enough already with that stupid guy.  Eric's a fan.  Jesus Christ.  So, Eric, you're just resting up for the big Conan taping?  The what?  I heard Conan taping.  You needed a little rest up?  You think Eric's looking forward to the Conan taping?  Probably.  No, the two had nothing to do with each other.  Oh.  What, the sick day and the Conan taping?  Yeah.  Well, it's the same day.  It's the same day.  Yeah.  So, who's going in your place today? 
[03:27:30]  I don't know.  Whoever Roland's going to take with him.  Roland.  I'll go.  Yeah, Eric's sick.  Me or Troy.  Troy, why don't you go?  This could be really cruel that now Eric's got to protect his ass and not go to the Conan taping  because fucking Roland, one of his friends, just blew up his spot.  It's Liam's fault.  Why is it Liam's fault?  He encouraged me to tell.  Really?  Damn you, Liam.  Damn you. 
[03:28:00]  Eric, you should go to the Conan taping today.  If you're feeling better.  Yeah.  You feeling?  Why not?  Or maybe come in here and do a half day.  Sure, why not?  As if it's like, oh, the Conan taping.  I had no idea.  You feeling up to it?  Eric, just claim food poisoning.  Go, look, I'm feeling much better now.  Exactly.  So, I had my sick day, but I could still do Conan O'Brien.  That's true.  The food poisoning excuse is a good one.  Yeah.  Any food excuse.  Any food excuse could really fucking work.  Well, guess. 
[03:28:30]  Because coming up with this over the air really legitimizes it.  Yeah, maybe it could have been kept quiet.  Yeah.  Roland.  I'm sorry.  Roland.  Which was started by Sam, by the way, because me, Ant, and Jim did not hear the conversation.  No.  Travis said it in my ear.  What am I going to ignore it?  Sam completely just wanted that out there so bad.  Actually, I blame Travis and Liam.  God damn it.  I was just telling my friend Sam my latest news.  As you were laughing your ass off.  Yes, absolutely.  He's got plans for his sick day. 
[03:29:00]  Took a sick day and has plans where it's not even that night.  No.  It's like when he's still supposed to be at work.  A matinee show.  Well, it was going low, so I have to bring it back up.  Oh, my God, Roland.  You're the best.  You're just the best.  And it was.  It was about.  It's for the show.  It's for the show.  It's for the show.  It's for the show.  The whole E-Rock thing was about to end.  Mm-hmm.  And then Roland came forward with this information.  Yeah.  It's Troy's in.  Eric, are you in a tough spot now, you think? 
[03:29:30]  I'm not.  It's 10-12.  You're the ones there late.  No.  We got the late jokes already.  You did a real good job with that.  I'm saying, I'm saying, I'm saying, are you going to still go to the Conan O'Brien taping  because now you're in a tough spot?  No, I'm not in a tough spot.  If you go, it seems like you weren't really sick.  Yeah.  Like you're sloughing off.  Sloughing.  Yes.  Eric?  Eric, Tom?  You have to go to the taping.  He's going to.  There's not. 
[03:30:00]  I mean, he's going to.  You don't think E-Rock will tell himself no?  No.  There might be celebrities there.  There's no self-control there.  I heard you, Jimmy.  That means he doesn't tell himself no often.  No, he's indulgent.  Because he's sad.  You know what?  You know what he's thinking to himself?  Well, I got my balls busted today.  I got woken up early by the show.  The least I could do is treat myself to it.  I deserve to go.  I need a treat.  And they're VIP tickets, so they're right, Fred.  Oh.  Really?  So you might be on camera?  Oh, yeah.  So much like Ferris Bueller at the ball game. 
[03:30:30]  Yeah.  I'm sure no one will screen cap that.  No.  Tweet it.  Here's Eric Gunn is sick today.  Oh, please, people.  Just DVR it, and we would love your Photoshops.  When does it air?  Eric, is your Twitter getting hammered today?  I don't know.  I'm on the phone.  I haven't looked at it.  No, you haven't.  Oh, well, you're on the phone.  He's the worst dresser in the country.  Who?  Who? 
[03:31:00]  Wow.  Outfits are terrible.  All right.  Well, fascinating.  Hope you feel better.  Conclusion here, I got to say.  That was cool.  Yeah, feel better, E-Rock.  Take, actually, yeah, just eat some soup.  Troy, I'm praying for you.  Take two aspirin and a live TV taping.  Wow, the balls on this kid.  I know.  A sick day and a Conan taping on the same day?  Goes beyond.  With one of his coworkers, by the way. 
[03:31:30]  Why wouldn't you have done the Conan taping Friday sick day?  That would be a perfect combination.  Yeah, what's wrong with you?  I went out after Conan.  I got food poisoning.  Because tonight's his last tape day in New York.  But he could do the taping now.  No, he didn't have to take the sick day today.  He would have taken it tomorrow.  He would have taken it tomorrow, and he could have gone out.  That's a beautiful start to the weekend.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, and then you got a fucking Conan taping and a three-day weekend.  Oh, and Jay Eggers tomorrow.  You have to go see.  What movie?  The what?  On a Friday afternoon?  Oh, enjoy.  It's going to happen.  The Jay Eggers movie? 
[03:32:00]  Will they give us copies of it?  What's the Jay Eggers movie?  Leonardo DiCaprio movie.  What?  Jager Hoover movie starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Armie Hammer.  We have Armie coming in.  Armie's cool.  I would like to see it, but I got a gig tomorrow.  I'll try to go.  Do you know, when I call in sick, I don't even tweet until, like, five in the afternoon.  Right.  Like, it's one of those things.  To go to a Conan taping, that is some set of balls.  I got to give it to you, Iraq.  Yeah.  He's gone.  Oh, he's gone.  He's not happy.  Yeah, that's some set of balls.  He's trying to talk to his cat. 
[03:32:30]  Why do they do this, Echo?  What?  What's the name of his cat?  Echo.  It's a weird cat.  Eric is under the impression that...  What, does it meow twice?  Sure doesn't Eggo?  Because he likes waffles.  Or Blecko, because that's what people say when he walks by, or Dumbo, Operation, such.  Why does he still work here at this point?  Everyone sells him out.  It's hilarious.  Well, he's under the impression that, like, with sick days, if you don't use them because 
[03:33:00]  you're not sick, they become vacation days.  Uh-huh.  And you just use them.  Just use them.  Here's the problem.  He's going to be mad at me eventually.  But the lie was going to come out.  He went with the lie still.  Yeah.  It is.  I mean, that's why...  That's where he was stupid.  You can't...  You can't keep going with the lie.  You got to admit it.  You got to start...  Okay, we were goofing, whatever.  You got to start talking to Vigery.  Like, oh, well, we kind of...  It sounded good, so we did this.  And you don't tell them it's been eight months.  Right.  Give them the opportunity to make it seem like it's their choice. 
[03:33:30]  Exactly.  I sort of had the sniffles.  I sort of sat in the third row.  You think he's going to be on TV?  In the audience?  That would be hilarious.  Because I bet pee in the first five rows.  I hope Conan picks him for one of those stupid bits of his.  Exactly.  I hope Conan doesn't get sick.  Fuck Conan O'Brien.  We tried for years.  Enough with that idiot.  God.  Oh, you can't get him on me?  We've tried everything.  Yeah, man.  He doesn't put any of you guys on his show.  He doesn't come on our show.  Oh, whatever. 
[03:34:00]  I don't...  To be honest with you, I don't know if he would have put me on his comedy booker I hated  years ago.  Yeah, small little Weasley guy.  Yeah.  Really?  Hated him.  Yeah, but a lot of our guys can't get on there.  And they're all funny fucking guys, obviously.  Yeah.  All right, Sam.  I guess it's yours now.  It's all yours.  It's all yours.  You take the con.  Take the helm.  Will do.  Great job, guys.  Of course it was.  And way to put in the overtime, too.  Yeah.  Coming in...  That's nine...  I got one request, Sam.  Yeah.  You trick Eric into thinking that he blew it himself and had nothing to do with it. 
[03:34:30]  Okay, I don't know exactly...  That's your goal.  Okay.  Actually, I have to send the tickets.  That's your goal.  That's 9.45 tomorrow we leave.  Oh, no.  9.43.  Yeah, true.  By the way, tonight, tomorrow, Saturday, Stress Factory.  I'm going there now.  Can I go with you tonight?  What time are the shows?  Tonight's 8 o'clock.  Tomorrow, 8 and 10.30.  I'm rolling.  See you later.  How are you doing there?  Travis.  Probably drive down at like 1, though.  I'm going to sleep.  Yeah, whoever's in there. 
[03:35:00]  Wait, you're going down there at 1?  Yeah, I'm going to stay in a hotel and sleep.  Oh!  I'm tired.  That sucks.  I'm kidding.  I want to see Jimmy at the Stress Factory.  Eric's on the phone.  Somebody pick up the phone.  Pick up the phone.  Somebody can talk while I'm running.  It's funnier to hear you run.  I'm going to sit here.  I'll see you later.  Amen.  I'll see you later. 
[03:35:30]  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye. </pre>
