<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often shifting abruptly between them. The show opened with discussions surrounding the Mark Foley scandal, focusing on the congressman's sexually suggestive online communications with underage pages.  Opie and Anthony played audio clips of Foley’s interviews, statements from his lawyer, and excerpts from his sexually explicit online chats, often acting them out and using vulgar language.  The hosts’ commentary included ironic juxtapositions of Foley’s past advocacy against child exploitation with his current actions.  They also satirized Foley's attempts to blame alcohol for his behavior.  A caller provided a crude joke related to the scandal, and the recurring homeless caller, "Tippi Tom," offered his opinions on the situation, alongside his views on abortion and O.J. Simpson.

The Mark Foley discussion transitioned into a segment on the high concentration of sex offenders in a Long Island neighborhood, prompting reactions from residents, including a 16-year-old who knew which houses to avoid. This segued into discussions about their TV commercial and YouTube presence.  The Amish school shooting was then addressed, along with the Amish tradition of "Rumspringa," with a caller, Shannon, sharing personal experiences near the Amish community.  This was interrupted by the unexpected arrival of "Harmonica Guy," a homeless man who attempted (poorly, according to the hosts) to promote a performance of Soulfly songs outside the studio.

The show also covered the impending midterm elections, the controversy surrounding a new energy drink called "Cocaine," and a new bill banning online gambling, which the hosts decried as deceptive legislation.  They ridiculed politicians' overreactions to "Cocaine" while highlighting their inaction on significant issues. This led to a listener call-in game where listeners suggested similarly offensive product names.  A lengthy segment involved a morbidly humorous call from a male nurse detailing anecdotes from his workplace.  The hosts also discussed the "Fatty Pig Fatty" contest, the acquisition of Mets and Yankees playoff tickets, and a disturbing smell near the studio, attributing it to a death behind a construction site.  The extremely hot studio temperature prompted the hosts and staff to strip down to their underwear.

Robert Reed was mentioned as a guest, though his contribution wasn't detailed.  John Hehner (actor from Napoleon Dynamite) and Billy Bob Thornton’s improvised scene from the "School for Scoundrels" DVD was discussed, alongside nonsensical wordplay like "slavery salsa" and "sodomy soda," and a bit about a plane experiencing mechanical difficulties.

A substantial portion of the show was dedicated to the "Top 10 British Funeral Songs" countdown, filled with dark humor and offensive jokes about death, funerals, and grief.  Songs like "Every Breath You Take," "Tears in Heaven," and "With or Without You" were featured, with sexually suggestive comments from the hosts.  The discussion included Elton John's "Candle in the Wind" and its various rewrites.  A caller, Marv, expressed discomfort, leading to mockery from the hosts.  Another caller, Laurie, shared a personal story about her father's death, which was used as fodder for further dark humor, including a fabricated black box recording.  The segment concluded with "Goodbye My Lover" being declared the number one song.  A segment with recurring caller Roland covered baseball, hockey, and his interest in extreme fetish videos.  The show concluded with a new, darkly comedic show opener about a deadly virus and a Macbook giveaway announcement. Throughout the entire broadcast, the hosts engaged in a constant stream of offensive jokes and banter, using listener calls as material for further crude humor.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony show on XM202 featuring Opie, Anthony, and James Norton.  Human beings in the country. Creeps. Ankle biters.  Obviously the strength is their ability to turn mistruth into something people would believe.  Wow, how long is this guy going to continue to babble and say nothing?  All day long.  Shut up.  Alright, here we go.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:00:30]  It's worse than I imagined.  That's terrible. I'm sorry.  We are a bunch of dopes.  I think we're lewd.  We're probably pushing 20 arrests because of this radio show.  Out of touch, corn balls, three retards.  We have the effect of Tylenol PM.  Opie.  You know I could have been a model.  Anthony.  I'm dead.  James Norton.  I like yogurt.  Robert Reed. 
[00:01:00]  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  It's going to be okay.  You will be molested. 
[00:01:30]  No, he's dead.  Good evening.  Food or the light. 
[00:02:00]  Oh, dear.  Oh, dear.  We have more transcripts today.  A couple more, I think, came through.  Nice.  Good morning.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  I hope everyone is doing okay today.  Sure.  We have lots of show to do.  We got another winner for the iMac book.  Yes.  We'll give that away a little later.  We're going to be talking about Fatty Pig Fatty.  We got new Foley IM exchanges. 
[00:02:30]  We have a human being.  We have the top 10 British funeral songs.  Watch.  Yeah, exactly.  Who decided to put that list together?  There's a new drink called cocaine that's driving people crazy.  Not the people drinking it, by the way.  No.  They can handle it.  They're into it.  They're like, whatever.  It's giving me a nice buzz.  But the politicians are just losing their minds. 
[00:03:00]  With these midterm elections coming up, it is insanity what these bastards, these useless  pieces of garbage that run this country on both sides, both sides are going after.  Anthony was losing it in the office only 15 minutes ago, just before we got on the air.  Livid.  And Travis is just like highlighting stuff and throwing it to me, knowing it's just going  to piss me off.  Oh, on the heels of this friggin' Foley controversy, and with these young boys. 
[00:03:30]  Oh, dear, young boys, please boot up my computer.  Woo!  William, hello.  Young William, where are you?  On the same ship you're on, idiot.  Oh, dear.  What are you wearing?  Are you wearing that cute little Mylar suit?  And the sweater?  Woo!  No, keep Penny out of this. 
[00:04:00]  She's a girl.  Ech.  Ugh.  L-O-L.  Yes.  Maybe we can go out and check on the hydroponic garden.  Me and you.  Dear boy.  Oh, dear.  Woo!  For some reason, your parents let you out alone with me every night.  I don't know why.  Oh, dear. 
[00:04:30]  Please respond to me.  Oh, I kicked off again.  Blasted computer.  Ah!  Signed back on 27 seconds later.  I'm all wound up in a tizzy.  Oh, dear.  So you were saying about Foley.  Oh.  Well, we got a few more transcripts.  Yeah.  Of him talking to his young boys.  Uh, that pretty much negates everything these idiots want to do.  Everything?  Yes. 
[00:05:00]  Until this is taken care of and we see how deep this runs and how many other perverts are  running around, uh, uh, in, uh, Congress and they're representing us and trying to sign  these bills into...  Two things that really got me today.  That cocaine drink.  Cocaine.  They are so annoyed that this drink is called cocaine.  You can't imagine how upset they are.  And literally, you can't imagine because some idiot got on the news, this politician, I 
[00:05:30]  don't know where he was from, I'm thinking uptown, uh, and starts talking about cocaine  and putting it in a context that I wanted to throw my own head out the window rather  than listen to this jackass talk about this.  And, uh, and the online gambling.  And the online gambling, right.  That's got me.  Yeah.  How they got this bill through.  How quickly this got through.  We were just talking about this, uh, very recently that they want to do away with online  gambling, which is pretty much poker, online poker. 
[00:06:00]  I don't know any guy that hasn't or doesn't like occasionally to pop online and play some  online poker.  I, I love it.  Have a lot of fun.  Um, if you're responsible, which 99% of the people are, it's fine.  There's some people out of control with everything.  There are some people that can't handle cool whip.  You know what I mean?  They'll just eat it until they drop dead.  Uh, but there's going to always be that percentage.  But for the most part, people just enjoy things.  Let them enjoy it.  Have a little fun. 
[00:06:30]  It's called, uh, freedom.  So they, they got this bill together now, which the president is ready to sign.  It's already run through both houses.  They love it.  Oh boy.  Can they work bipartisanly when, when it comes to this crap, when it comes to useless garbage  like this, when it comes to our actual security and things that are important, they fight  and fight and nothing ever gets done.  But gambling, big problem.  So, uh, do you think this was debated over and gone back and forth?  No.  I find out it's piggybacked on a bill. 
[00:07:00]  And I hope he brought this up in the office too.  Whoever put this through is a genius.  Whoever like came up with the idea of taking a bill that you want to sign into law.  And have a bunch of crap on it.  And have crap tagged to it that have nothing to do with each other.  Absolutely nothing.  It's like, uh, we're going to have a seatbelt law.  We're going to go after the terrorists and we're, uh, we're banning French fries. 
[00:07:30]  There you go.  What?  And it's like, well, the terrorism thing is fair.  But I like French fries.  But it doesn't matter.  And most of these bloated, old, out of touch pedophiles, uh, don't, don't even read it.  They read like the first line and signed it.  There was a guy, wish I could remember his, his asinine name.  But actually signed the bill, um, uh, backing the war.  And then later on said, well, I didn't read it. 
[00:08:00]  He didn't read it.  What are they doing?  Well, they're generalizing.  So we should generalize.  They're saying that online gambling is bad for everybody.  Bad for everyone.  No one could take it.  So we're saying today that all politicians are pedophiles.  All politicians, fat, bloated, out of touch pedophile.  Homosexual pedophile.  Right.  That's what they are.  That's what we're saying.  Because if they could generalize, we could generalize.  If everyone can't take gambling.  The fact is most people could do their online gambling and there's not a problem whatsoever. 
[00:08:30]  It's the tiny, small percentage.  And actually it's to protect the damn children again.  But they're saying it's everybody has to be protected from this.  Everyone's got to be protected.  And we know what the real issue is here.  They want their peace.  They want their cuts.  That's all this is about.  But they're going to make believe they're protecting the children.  No, they just want their piece of the action because they realize that these online gambling sites are just making a assload of money.  And they're not being taxed.  And that's what it is.  So the president's expected to sign the bill, making it harder to place bets on the Internet. 
[00:09:00]  What they're doing in essence is making it hard for you to use credit card companies and process payments, settle Internet bets.  You can't use credit cards, checks, things like that to finance your accounts.  And how they would then be able to pay you back is going to be a difficult thing too, how the gambling site pays you when you want to withdraw money from the site.  So that's what they're signing into legislation.  It's so infuriating. 
[00:09:30]  But even more so is – here it is.  The chief – the bill's chief Senate sponsor was conservative Republican John Kyle who, like Leach, has said he believes Internet gambling was a moral threat.  He has called online betting as the Internet version of crack cocaine.  I wonder what this ass is into.  I'd love to dig into his personal life because the more passion you have against something above and beyond a normal concern, the more passion you have for something above and beyond normal concern shows a problem. 
[00:10:00]  This guy, I would assume, in my personal opinion, to save my ass, has a gambling problem.  Has a gambling problem.  That would be my personal opinion.  I'm not sure.  But the way he's acting about this, the passion he has against it is above and beyond what a normal person – how they would react to this. 
[00:10:30]  Just like our friend Mr. Foley had such a problem – and we'll go into that a little later – on children and sexual situations involving children and how they should be dealt with.  He had such a problem.  He was going news show to news show just talking about this.  And now we see what kind of a freak, pervert this son of a bitch ended up being.  My favorite Foley stuff today is in the Daily News.  Oh, it's beautiful.  Where he goes on just about every talk show to talk about how bad the teenage nude camps are. 
[00:11:00]  Right, nudist camps and how parents are taking their kids to nudist camps and how awful it is.  And he uses some analogies and words and terminology that, oh, who the hell knew this existed?  He's pawing through it in a froth.  He was trying to shut down the nudist camps for teenagers.  But some of the stuff he's saying on these talk shows, beyond hilarious, you can't write anything better than that.  Well, they say here, look, gambling can be highly addictive, especially when it's done over an unregulated environment.  But if they're worried about addictive things that are going to hurt you, like why not just make alcohol illegal? 
[00:11:30]  Get alcohol.  Get cigarettes.  Now, this annoys me because I think people should have the freedom to do that too, obviously.  But if it's under the guise of protecting people, if you're doing this under that guise, how about people that are completely allowed to smoke in their own home, which you're an adult, you have the freedom to do that, yet have small children and are completely affecting their children.  Now, where are the politicians saving the children from their parents and that smoke? 
[00:12:00]  Where are they?  You don't see it because the tobacco lobby is huge and tobacco is just a huge business for this country.  And you'll never see that happen.  Same with alcohol.  There's supposed to be less government.  Less intrusive government.  Well, this is midterm election bull crap that tries – so when the ads run, they can say, look, we're the good guys.  And this makes it even worse.  And this is something everyone should be aware of.  Well, the Republicans tucked this measure, this bill against online gambling, funding your accounts, into a bill aimed at enhancing port security, which passed early Saturday. 
[00:12:30]  So they got a bill that was to enhance port security.  You've heard about container ships coming in.  Which is scaring the crap out of everybody.  It's scaring everyone.  Especially in the New York area.  We're well aware.  Oh, my God.  That a ship could come in with some crap.  Container ships.  They say disease.  They could say bombs, people, whatever.  It could come out of these container ships. 
[00:13:00]  So increase port security and add it to that bill on the bottom.  When you sign one signature, signs that bill for enhancing port security, you're also signing the same bill to outlaw online gambling.  And French fries.  Well, I'll read back.  That's part of that bill as well.  That's right.  Well, you can't vote against it.  Like, what are they going to say?  You're right.  Because that's what we were saying in the back office.  Because then the commercials start playing for the midterm elections.  And it says, Senator so-and-so didn't sign a bill aimed at enhancing port security. 
[00:13:30]  And he's supposed to go, well, on his commercial.  Well, let me explain.  There was also attached to this online gambling thing that I felt wasn't peep.  Vote for idiot.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Because that's all the people here.  Right.  He voted against enhancing port.  I got to vote against him.  People, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  It's a scam.  The politicians scamming you by piggybacking these bills. 
[00:14:00]  and who the hell was the first one to piggyback, and how did it get through?  That's what I want to know.  How did this guy go?  Who's the guy in history that thought this gem up?  Someone that wanted a few extra weeks of vacation a year  and decided we could get a lot of crap done at the same time?  Yeah, at the same time.  Why sign one bill at a time when we can just pile a bunch of stuff?  And it probably started, let me be honest, and maybe less cynical,  it probably started with very similar things.  Like, this would have been enhanced port security and airport security. 
[00:14:30]  Right.  Like, let's just take these two bills, they're very similar,  put them together and sign them, we'll save some time.  And we'll check the trucks going into tunnels.  Trucks going into, right, things that are similar.  Fast forward a few years and also it's like, now we're banning french fries, online gambling.  And sneakers on the street.  And snicker bars.  Spitting on the sidewalk.  Right.  Bus security.  Yeah.  And we'll buy us ply radial tires.  But what is, why? 
[00:15:00]  Doesn't make sense.  How?  Here's the audio really fast, it's a quick story.  Online gambling companies could be forced to cash in their chips if Congress gets its way.  And some bettors aren't happy about that.  I definitely think that it's taking it a little too far.  What he's talking about is a bill that's sped through the House and Senate Saturday morning.  The legislation bans the use of credit cards, checks, and electronic fund transfers for online gaming.  People think that this can't kill the online betting industry.  They should take a look at what happens to the online pirated music sharing industry. 
[00:15:30]  It is definitely a possibility that this could kill the industry because the U.S. market is the biggest market.  Some major online gambling companies based outside the country have already suspended or severely restricted their American operations and have seen their stock prices plummet.  Just offer the government some money and you'll be back in business.  Just get out of our lives.  Why can't they just leave it alone?  I know where this piggybacking started, by the way.  There was an article on this.  It was like, no taxation without representation. 
[00:16:00]  And then some guy said, and how about it's okay to own a Negro?  All right, where do I sign?  No one will sign that.  Where do ye sign?  Absolutely.  I absolutely think this legislation is going to work.  I'm looking at some of the websites and they immediately posted notices to their customers about what they were going to do.  And basically what they said is, we'll follow the letter of the law.  Internet gambling has always been illegal but difficult to police.  Now, by shutting down the cash pipeline, the government has found a way to crack down on it. 
[00:16:30]  If you're online and you're gambling right now, what this means is they won't accept your American money.  They won't accept your American credit cards.  You're going to have to find a way to have an anonymized email address, an offshore bank account, and offshore credit cards.  All the bill needs now to become law is the president's signature.  He's expected to sign it soon.  Of course he is.  Of course he is.  This is something they can all rally around.  How about something that makes sense and helps the American people?  I want a liberal. 
[00:17:00]  I'm sick.  I've had enough.  Yeah, we need the pendulum to swing the other way until we're sick of those idiots.  I want a bleeding heart.  I want someone that hyphenates, who always says African-American.  I want Jerry Brown.  I want a radical liberal.  Enough.  Just swing it the other way and then we'll get sick of him and put in some conservative Republicans.  It's the same old crap.  That's why you need a radical.  You need a radical.  A guy who wants to burn down the White House while he's in it.  He hates him so much.  He hates himself even because he's part of the machine, man. 
[00:17:30]  I hate me, man.  I want a radical.  We love our online gambling.  Imagine that, some liberal so left-wing gets in there and the news has a report,  the president assassinated himself today.  So sick of being part of the system.  He was found face first in a pile of hemp and communist literature.  Oh, I'm sick of the conservatives. 
[00:18:00]  I really am.  Just get out of our lives.  Get out of my life.  They're protecting the children.  And there's the ad, of course, of all the news stations today talking about cocaine.  Cocaine.  The drink cocaine.  Why don't we take a quick break?  And then let's get into some coke.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Cocaine.  And the stupid news person.  Now you could have your cocaine right on the bar.  Right on the bar.  Yeah, they're talking about it like it's actual cocaine.  They're making little puns and jokes. 
[00:18:30]  This is going to interfere with my beverage.  I'm so aggravated.  I fought so many years to get this whole beverage thing together.  And now my new stuff, chilled child's blood, is never going to be sold.  Oh, you joke, Jimmy.  Wait till you hear what a black politician said.  What the next product's going to be.  Oh, he speculated as to what this could start.  He certainly speculated.  I think the listeners should start speculating right now.  I like speculating.  Audience participation today on the Opie and Anthony show.  Oh, they're going to be ridiculous.  Well, yeah.  Stupid cocaine.  Who cares? 
[00:19:00]  Why don't you go after the real cocaine?  Why don't you go after the real cocaine instead of a stupid soft drink called cocaine?  Oh, who's the guy that annoyed me more?  This is perfect for politicians.  Perfect.  Don't go after the real cocaine.  Go after something that is named after cocaine.  Bill was approved.  409 to 2.  That's the port security.  I mean, obviously you have to.  Of course.  Is that called pork barrel?  I don't know.  Is it a pork barrel when you throw all these things in?  No.  It's something that they do.  Pork barrel is when you, one of these fat cats, congressmen, their district gets money 
[00:19:30]  based on a bill.  What's it called when they just do this?  Yeah, they've called it piggybacking, but there's another political word for it.  Bill stuffing.  How did you know about pork barrel?  Oh, I think I saw it on the Discovery Channel.  Forget Aristotle and fuck Socrates.  Here comes Professor Anthony.  Thank you. 
[00:20:00]  No, actually the official, I do know what it is.  It's called Bill Adding On To.  You're right.  He's a bill adder on to.  Er.  Er.  All right, we'll take a break and we'll continue with the cocaine drink.  You got that politician yet?  Mm-mm.  We're cutting it up.  All right, Jimmy's going to lose his mind when he hears what the politician is suggesting  might be the next product that comes out.  I don't even know if this guy was a politician.  I don't know what he was.  Some kind of representative.  He was representing.  He represents uptown. 
[00:20:30]  Uptown.  He represents uptown.  All right, it's the ONA virus spreading across America.  Hear what everyone else is talking about.

It's the ONA virus spreading across America with Lul Jimmy Norton.  Our phone number is 1-866-313-FREE.  Lots of stuff to talk about in the news today.  This show is weird.  Some days we don't even acknowledge that the world exists and we just do our own silly little thing.  Ignorance is bliss. 
[00:21:30]  We do dumb stuff like we weigh fatties all day.  Bring on the pigs.  And then the next day we talk intelligently about the topics of the day.  We get upset about some of the news.  Online gambling.  They're going after that to protect the children.  You know, Anthony turned me on to the whole protect the children thing.  And I thought you were crazy when you brought this up to me years ago.  Well, I am.  Well, you're crazy for other things.  So often.  But now I'm with you.  Yeah.  Parents got to parent their kids. 
[00:22:00]  And then we'll be able to enjoy stuff like online gambling.  Or else we're just stuck.  And violent video games.  Or else we'll just be stuck in this environment of baby Einstein videos.  And things that are safe for kids.  Rounded corners.  Everything will have rounded corners and be soft and plush.  No one's safe!  To save us from ourselves.  No one's safe!  The children can grow up in a safe environment.  What happened to just living your life and, you know, hey, everyone's got their crosses to bear. 
[00:22:30]  Everyone's got their tragedies in their life.  There's no politician that's going to protect everybody from everything.  Take all the enjoyment out of life.  And I don't care how safe it is.  It's going to suck.  It's fake protection.  It's just fake protection.  Because they don't want to go after the real issues.  No, it's too hard.  Here's an issue for the politicians.  I have family and friends in Huntington, Long Island. 
[00:23:00]  I live in Manhattan.  You'll figure out how I can get home in less than an hour.  An hour?  Wow.  That's what I'm saying.  You've got a flying car?  Well, in the middle of the night, you can do it in what?  Yeah, in an hour.  In 50 minutes.  Any other time, it's close to two hours.  Rush hours, at least two hours.  That's a real issue that bothers the crap out of people.  But no politician in their right mind would take that on.  17 miles.  We'll take that on.  Right.  How about race mixing?  Right.  Why isn't anybody...  Oh, wait a minute.  I didn't agree with that. 
[00:23:30]  Why don't they take on the tough issues?  Because it's too risky.  Well, it leads into the next topic here.  Cocaine.  Cocaine.  Cocaine is...  You must mean the drug.  Who would be against bringing a bill against cocaine  and having cocaine brought into this country and...  Oh, oh, you must not be talking about the real cocaine.  Right.  I mean, cocaine is a massive, massive problem in this country.  Yes, it is.  You don't really hear the politicians going after cocaine on a daily basis, 
[00:24:00]  but they're all over the TV today, these politicians,  with the drink called cocaine.  Yeah.  Because that's much scarier than the actual drug.  Oh, my God.  The children.  What of the children?  Yeah, this is a beverage.  It's called cocaine.  Nice graphic on the can.  Which, by the way, I now want to try.  It looks like it's drawn out in cocaine.  The logo looks like it was made by a guy that's just wired. 
[00:24:30]  Yeah, it looks like you could snort the name off the can.  I think that's what they were going for.  Yeah.  They were going for it.  This is the dopey politicians and the media.  I had no idea about cocaine, but they're telling me all about it,  and guess what?  I want to now try it.  They will give things the best advertising they could ever wish for,  and this company, whatever's putting out cocaine,  has to be loving the coverage they're getting on this.  Don't they realize that all they have to do is not talk about it  and not show their dopey faces on TV? 
[00:25:00]  But they're very upset.  Something like this would probably just fade, fade away.  Fade away.  A couple bars would be serving it.  It would be one of those things.  Oh, you hear about the bar downtown that serves the cocaine thing?  Cocaine and vodka.  A lot of people are digging on the cocaine and vodka, like the Red Bull.  You know, Red Bull and vodka.  Now they're getting the cans of cocaine and vodka.  Red Bull stinks.  I've tried it.  It's just not tasty.  People don't like Red Bull.  Some people don't like it.  You don't drink it for the taste.  I mean, I just bothered my stomach.  I didn't like it.  Yeah, too much caffeine in there. 
[00:25:30]  I drink a Red Bull to stay up late, you know, stuff like that.  I'm not sitting around a bar, like, sipping it like it's a nice cocktail.  It's for people that want poor man's speedball.  You get vodka in it.  You want to stay up.  Yeah.  You don't want coffee because it's hot out, something like that.  You don't like the taste of coffee.  That's what it's for.  This cocaine, though, comes out, and people are just livid.  But these politicians are livid that someone had the gall to put the name cocaine on a beverage that, by the way, doesn't have any cocaine in it. 
[00:26:00]  It's caffeine.  It's got 280 milligrams of caffeine in it.  Right.  They are trying to say now.  This is how I think they're going to spin this, but Oprah brought up a good point.  They're going to try to say that that much caffeine is dangerous.  So that's how they're going to probably try to pull it off the market.  Well, I've got to tell you, Newsday today, showing our beverages and how many milligrams of cocaine. 
[00:26:30]  Of cocaine.  How many milligrams of caffeine are in certain drinks, like Snapple.  Snapple has 31.5 milligrams of caffeine.  No big deal, right?  Yep.  Coke, 34 milligrams.  Pepsi, 38.  Dr. Pepper, 41 milligrams.  We're going up here, obviously.  Mountain Dew.  Get a nice buzz off of Mountain Dew, right?  Do the do, they say.  55 milligrams of caffeine.  Red Bull, we were just talking about that.  Only 80 milligrams of caffeine. 
[00:27:00]  80?  80.  And then you get to cocaine, the new energy drink.  Yep.  280 milligrams of caffeine.  280.  80, so you're thinking now, I'm thinking, okay, what they're going to try to do is say that that much caffeine in a beverage is dangerous, and we have to pull it from the market because it's too much caffeine, and that's how we get rid of this cocaine beverage.  I didn't hear what you just said because they just showed Foley again on TV. 
[00:27:30]  I can't get enough of that guy.  I can't get enough of that guy.  How do you not love him?  I can't get enough of that creepy.  Look, he's just walking, and you just know he's a creep.  A purple tie.  Thinking of lacrosse legs.  You creep.  We'll get into Foley in a little while.  Foley's a naughty boy.  You said it's on about 280 milligrams of caffeine.  Yeah, and that's how they're going to try to shut it down, I think, or at least I said that earlier, but then you brought up something that –  Well, this is where their argument just fails miserably.  Starbucks coffee, 16-ounce.  That's pretty much what everyone drinks, including junior high kids at this point.  Yeah. 
[00:28:00]  372 milligrams of caffeine.  Way more.  What's that?  A cup of coffee, 16-ounce.  What you're drinking right now?  Are you drinking coffee today?  Yes.  Yeah, a 16-ounce cup of coffee from Starbucks, 372 milligrams of caffeine.  So now if they outlawed cocaine based on caffeine content, they would have to outlaw Starbucks coffee.  But I like coffee.  Don't worry.  I don't think they will.  I need my coffee.  But now how do you think they're going to go about this?  A boycott?  Who's going to boycott it? 
[00:28:30]  The people that they're marketing this to?  The 20-year-olds like to go out, drink, mix it with some vodka.  That's pretty much who's drinking this.  I don't think kids are really into going to the store and buying this.  Young, school-aged children.  No, the kids will definitely buy the cocaine.  Not a lot of them.  There's going to be a few.  Honest to God, man.  Kids are drinking Red Bull like crazy.  This is the next step.  They'll definitely be drinking it.  Well, then as a parent, if you don't like seeing the word cocaine in your fridge, smack your kid in the side of the head with the can. 
[00:29:00]  And then tell him and his multicultural friends to come over and have some Sonny D.  Sonny D.  Stupid Sonny D.  A black face, a white face, an Asian face in the fridge.  Sonny D for all.  I hate those goddamn commercials.  Of course you do.  Multicultural beverage of love.  Care for some Sonny D, black friend?  Sure do, Asian and white friend.  The blonde mom comes out and brings it with cookies. 
[00:29:30]  Look, you and your inferior friends can have a little Sonny D.  By the way, we've just accepted that, you know, the name Coke, Coca-Cola.  Yeah, what about Coke?  I think more people call cocaine Coke than they do cocaine when you're actually doing this stuff.  You don't say, hey, do you have any cocaine? 
[00:30:00]  I guess it's because we're not just shoving it in, you know, in the consumer's faces where it says the word cocaine.  Cocaine.  And the logo's like lines of Coke.  I don't care.  It's called Coke.  Why aren't they going after that?  Well, I would use hip.  Used to have it in it.  I would use hip terms when I was getting high.  Like, I'd say, hey, you got a bag of toot?  Toot.  Hey.  Toot.  You want to do a toot?  Care for some nose candy?  All right, here we go.  Let's say hi to.  Play lacrosse today?  Let's say hi to Steve in Delaware. 
[00:30:30]  Steve.  Hey, ONA.  Hey.  You guys rock.  I'm a nurse that works in an emergency room.  Male nurse.  What is your job, sir?  Do you smother the elderly?  You're gay or a murderer.  Or both.  Probably, yeah.  A little calm day.  A little calm day.  But we get a flyer.  You wipe the asses of old people. 
[00:31:00]  Yes.  Yes, I do.  Change a bedpan.  Then take that pillow and tightly wrap it around that old head.  I have bad news.  She died of a disease that strikes in the night.  They just pass away, and their nose twists to the left and stays there.  And there's feathers all in their face and hair.  Doctor, you might want to check on room 272.  That's right.  That's all creepy.  Her little old lady legs shake, and two white shoes fall on the floor. 
[00:31:30]  Ha, ha, ha.  Go flunk.  They look like the shoes Michael Caine had on at the end of Dressed to Kill.  Is that what you're doing, sir?  No.  We actually just got a warning about that drink working its way.  Excuse me.  The doctors got the warning.  Not the male nurses.  Not the male nurses.  Absolutely right.  But who keeps the doctors in line?  It is the male nurses.  Is it?  We get warning.  Doc, you might want to check on Margaret. 
[00:32:00]  Do you dress like a doctor?  Do people think you're a doctor?  Do you walk around with a stethoscope?  And a white hat, too?  And then you see a doctor coming in, and you quickly hide it.  You should have to wear that white hat with the red X in the front.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  That's right.  And that white skirt that Florence Nightingale used to wear.  Right.  Why should the male nurses be allowed to dress like doctors when the female nurses have to  dress like nurses?  Doctor, you might want to check on Gertrude. 
[00:32:30]  She's not waking up.  The male nurses put on scrubs like they're going to be doing surgery.  Meanwhile, the only thing you're scrubbing is wrinkled old doily butt.  That's right.  And man junk.  Give that man junk a good scrubbing.  You're a hospital maid.  Ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Oh, God.  Ha, ha, ha.  I understand why you've got to smother some of them.  Ha, ha, ha.  Oh, this guy don't stop every day. 
[00:33:00]  Twice a day, he's messing himself.  Every day, Betty complains her soup is cold.  Well, it's not anymore, is it, Betty?  It's not.  It's not cold in heaven.  It's not cold in heaven, Mary.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Two angry male nurse hands holding down the pillow.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  And I have big hairy...  Doc, you might want to check on Betty.  I have a old lady's hand.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  That's music to your ears, isn't it, son? 
[00:33:30]  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Let me check Betty.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Uh-oh.  Code blue face.  Code blue face.  Ha, ha, ha.  Her hands rubbed the defensive position.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  It's tilted to the left.  Yeah, how do you fix that if they're fighting you off and die that way?  Ha, ha, ha.  Crank the arms back down.  I noticed he had scratches on his arms and face.  She must have died knitting.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  You guys rule, man. 
[00:34:00]  All right.  If a doctor wants to call in and give us something, then that would be terrific.  Right, right.  Yeah, sorry.  Goodbye, male nurse.  Thank you.  Goodbye.  Jeremy in Cleveland.  Goodbye, gender-neutral language.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Good morning, guys.  Hi, sir.  No, it's Opie's line.  How you wipe the asses of old people, that was triceless, Opie.  That's all he does.  I have a nomination, sir.  Thank you.  I don't know if it made it through on this side of the show, but the XMers heard it.  Well, that's all that matters, man.  Punch it out. 
[00:34:30]  All right.  Thank you, Jeremy.  Tried cocaine drink at Burns.  Mike in Westchester, what's up?  Oh, what's up, man?  Hey, Mike.  What's up, man?  A guy at my job got the cases already.  And when you actually drink it, it actually burns your throat.  It took me two days to finish this thing.  One can.  Yeah, I don't know.  It's probably a horrible beverage.  Yeah, the drink probably stinks.  It's a gimmick.  But they know how to market it, because we're all talking about it today.  And it's meant as a mixer, I believe. 
[00:35:00]  It's really, really strong.  All right, sir.  Thank you.  And I guarantee they'll crack down on the stores that sell it.  None of the major stores will sell it.  Pathmark.  No.  Stop and shop.  Well, here's a question.  How politically correct are we going to get with product names?  Are we going to go after products that are named after things like cocaine?  Well, AIDS didn't survive the candy.  That candy.  Oh, do we have that commercial?  You're going to have to work today.  Let's go.  Let's go. 
[00:35:30]  They did take candy cigarettes off the market, too.  Remember those as a kid?  They were good.  I remember having little candy cigarettes, and it could be just like mommy and daddy.  That's right.  With the little can in.  And then you'd eat it when you were done.  And it had like a little.  Like a real cigarette.  A candy little drink.  Like a little shot.  And then it came with like a little candy black eye to put on your little girlfriend.  It was straightened around.  When you got home.  You tape it on.  Put this on.  Hey, let's go to James.  James, what's up?  Hey, guys.  There's a candy black eye. 
[00:36:00]  And for the girls to smoke their little candy cigarettes, and then it would come with  a little candy baby with like a tumor on it or something wrong with it.  Oh, look.  A little deformed candy baby.  And you could eat it all.  That's right.  Let's punch it and watch sugar flow off.  James, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Yeah, this whole cocaine thing is ridiculous.  You know, are they going to stop selling pots because that's the name of the drug?  Oh, what?  Pots?  I'm not sure what you mean, sir.  Like pots and pans? 
[00:36:30]  Yeah.  Do you mean like a product name?  Food.  That was.  Food.  All right.  You know, James, Norton's going to be leaving to play West Palm Beach, and we're thinking.  I should be under the wheels of that plane?  Okay, now that's funny.  Oh, well, now I'm thinking he should step in for Jim one day.  That's right.  When those wheels come down to land in West Palm, your frozen carcass should fall out. 
[00:37:00]  Kai, girl, Maine, what's up?  Not much.  I just wanted to say hi.  I've been trying to get a hold of you guys for quite a few days.  I love your show.  Thanks.  Is your name Kylie, and that's short?  No, it's Kai.  It's short for Kai Marie.  Yeah?  Is it Kai Marie?  New listener, are you?  Excuse me?  Are you a new listener?  Oh, no.  Actually, yeah.  I think I started listening to it on WCYY, which, by the way, they do use the term Rocktober. 
[00:37:30]  Oh, right on WCYY.  Yeah, that's where it is.  Where's that?  Maine.  Oh, Maine.  Okay.  Yeah, yeah.  You're on in Maine, Jimmy.  I didn't really grow up in Maine.  I'm actually from Massachusetts, Cape Cod.  No one cares.  No one cares.  Well, what happened, honey?  We care, Kai.  Would you vacation in Maine occasionally?  What brought you up there?  I actually had grandparents that lived up here.  My parents moved up there and built a house.  Yeah.  Why would you want to move up there with your grandparents? 
[00:38:00]  Guys, let's be, you know, she's a new listener, and I like to find out what bit turned someone  on to the show, you know, because it is a virus.  So what got you hooked on the show, Kai?  What was the bit you heard?  She went, I think she knew what was coming.  Wow.  She may have known.  She was like, oh, maybe.  She was like, Pesci.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Here's the AIDS commercial.  Right now, a lot of places don't even sell it in the city. 
[00:38:30]  Oh, boy.  Oh, no.  Oh, boy.  E-Rock.  Oh, no.  I wish I could blame someone.  I really do.  Blame someone.  Go ahead.  But blame them on the basis of ethnicity or religion.  Come on, somebody.  Kenny.  I have to blame myself today.  Wow.  Yeah.  I was overweight and embarrassed to go any place.  AIDS helped me get back into a size 12.  The AIDS diet plan helped me get back into a size 6. 
[00:39:00]  Oh, that's good.  Thanks for that version.  Not going well.  That wasn't me.  Oh, my God.  Let me just.  What happened?  What happened?  What happened?  Wow.  Is it broken?  I don't know.  Let's try it again.  Let's give it another shot.  Pop it in there, Hawk.  Busted.  We have a nice energy going on the show today. 
[00:39:30]  Back goes Griffey looking up.  And it's out of here.  Or is it?  No, it's off the wall.  My mistake.  Subway series, baby.  That's right.  Mets Tigers.  I would love to see Mets Tigers.  Me too.  I would love to see Mets Tigers.  Let's go.  Let's go.  That's a hell of a subway ride.  A subway ride for Ellie.  Jesus.  I was overweight and embarrassed to go any place.  AIDS helped me get back into a size 12.  The AIDS diet plan helped me get back into a size 6. 
[00:40:00]  AIDS helps control your appetite so you lose weight.  Yet AIDS lets you taste, chew, and enjoy.  And the appetite suppressant in AIDS is not a stimulant.  AIDS helped me lose the weight.  It has nothing in it that could make me nervous.  Questions.  Why take diet pills when you can enjoy AIDS?  AIDS helps you lose weight safely and effectively.  Use only as directed.  I just don't like the applicator it comes in.  And it always hurts.  Because I'm face down in the pillow receiving a dose. 
[00:40:30]  How great is that?  How great is it that you're the CEO of the AIDS company there?  We're going to make millions.  This is amazing.  Life's great.  You've got mansions all over the world.  You see how this AIDS thing is selling?  And then the first headline, 1981 or 82, whatever it was.  New disease.  Right.  AIDS.  AIDS kills black gentlemen in San Francisco.  Uh-oh.  AIDS is killing Haitians.  AIDS is killing gays. 
[00:41:00]  AIDS is killing Africans.  AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS.  AIDS die, AIDS die, die, AIDS, AIDS die.  AIDS, AIDS, AIDS.  But what of our candy?  You have AIDS.  Yes, you have AIDS.  I hate to tell you, boy, that you have AIDS.  You've got the AIDS.  You may have caught it when you stuck that filthy needle in here.  Or maybe all that unprotected sex, won't you hear?  It isn't clear.  But what we're certain of is you have AIDS.  Yes, you have AIDS.  Not HIV, but full-blown AIDS.  AIDS. 
[00:41:30]  Be sure that you see that this is not HIV.  But full-blown AIDS.  Not HIV, but really full-blown AIDS.  I'm sorry, I wish it was something less serious.  But it's AIDS.  You've got the AIDS.  Do you think that the AIDS CEO, when he was bummed out, like after his product wasn't going to make it, 
[00:42:00]  had to call his friend who had tried the new hair treatment stuff called Cancer with a K?  I know how you feel.  I know.  See, I told you to watch the names you pick.  You never know, friend.  All right, listen, we've got to take a break.  We went off on a massive tangent with that male nurse.  So we have the story from Fox 5 about the cocaine drink. 
[00:42:30]  Yes.  With this black politician suggesting maybe names for other products.  Other products that might be spawned because of this.  It could just spiral out of control.  We may be heading into audience participation after this break.  So stay right there.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  It's the O.B. and Anthony Show.  What up?  It's the O.B. and Anthony Show. 
[00:43:00]  Hi.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  Man, our TV commercial is being played like crazy in New York City.  Yeah.  It's to the point we see it in the office before the show.  We're like, ah.  We don't look anymore.  At first, it was very, very exciting.  It's still exciting.  I just don't like, like I've seen it.  I want to do another one.  Yeah.  Please, another.  Finance another.  Bring, bring another to us. 
[00:43:30]  Ah, we'll see how well we do.  That'll determine if we get to do another commercial.  Scott, the trucker, what's up?  I am inviting, speaking of AIDS, I'm inviting all your listeners to aid Jerry Springer tonight  as he dances his way to the stars.  Yeah, we're trying to get Jerry Springer to win the whole thing, and we thought we had  a really good shot at doing it, but we're finding out that the judges have an influence  on the voting.  50% of the vote is the judge.  50% is the people.  So we got to just have so many votes for him that it kind of...  See, they're trying to protect against a dopey radio show voting the silly one to win 
[00:44:00]  the whole thing.  But we're going to try anyway.  Anyway, so we encourage everyone to vote for Jerry Springer once again today.  It's tonight, right?  Yeah.  Okay, boys.  Thanks.  Hey, what are you hauling there, Scott?  Apparently nothing.  I guess dead air.  Well, yes.  Because he...  And...  You could crash me, please.  Oh, well, it's kind of, like, funny.  Oh.  All right, cocaine, the drink. 
[00:44:30]  Here's the official news story.  We were talking about this just before the break.  Cocaine.  For sure.  Right now, a lot of places don't even sell it in the city, but here at Manahata's, you  can have...  You see what the news is doing here?  He just told you where to get it, kids.  You see what the news is doing here?  This product, basically, it sounds like it stinks.  Yeah.  And that the name is cool.  Or is...  You're saying cocaine is cool, Opie?  The name is cool.  It's an attention getter.  People like that.  But it sounds like the product itself sucks, or establishments all over New York City 
[00:45:00]  would have been serving this by now.  Yeah.  But now we're all finding out about it.  How long has it been on the market?  I never heard of it until, like, today.  It's been...  I heard about a couple weeks ago.  27 years there, Jim.  27 years.  Oh, no, that's not the truth.  Finally, no?  That's a bunk.  A couple years ago, maybe?  A couple weeks ago?  Right now, a lot of places don't even sell it in the city, but here at Manahata's, you  can have your cocaine right on the bar.  Ten, you.  Bye, cut.  There you go. 
[00:45:30]  Serve with a straw.  And there sits the most controversial, if not hottest, new drink in Manhattan.  It's called cocaine.  It's got a serious kick to it.  I think Jimmy's beverage is more controversial.  No wonder cocaine to drink doesn't actually have cocaine in it, but is loaded with 280 milligrams  of caffeine and sugar, promising a serious rush.  Red Bull on drugs, on steroids.  This has definitely got a lot of kick to it.  City lawmakers not getting a kick out of it. 
[00:46:00]  But they failed to mention that coffee still has more milligrams of caffeine.  Yeah, a lot more.  And a lot of people like to mix their coffee drinks with a nice shot or two of alcohol.  Yeah.  But they're not going to mention that because then it's not as impressive, the story.  On steroids.  This has definitely got a lot of kick to it.  City lawmakers not getting a kick out of it think the high-energy cocaine drink sends  the wrong message.  Message.  Have you lost all-  All right, here it comes.  I want to pause right here. 
[00:46:30]  Here he comes.  Hold on.  I want to pause right here.  Hold on to your seat.  Grab something.  If you're standing up and can't sit, grab onto a beam or something so you don't just topple  over at this guy's analogy.  We don't know who this guy is.  We're not sure if he's a local politician or someone that just represents the neighborhood.  Represent.  I don't know.  But he might have thought things out a little bit.  But I know one thing.  He's an opportunist.  Yeah.  And he knew how to get his face on TV. 
[00:47:00]  City councilman.  Of course.  Another councilman.  You're a dog catcher.  Dog catcher.  What the hell is a city councilman?  What do they do?  What do they really do?  They're worthless.  They do nothing.  They complain and they belly it about what they can't get.  Whiners.  I'm a city whiner.  Wah.  Wah.  Cocaine.  Wah.  We're not getting enough money.  They make a lot of noise, but they have to wait for their superiors to actually do all  the heavy lifting.  Oh, yeah.  They can do nothing. 
[00:47:30]  They do nothing.  They go and go, excuse me, sir.  There's a couple of people I represent down this block.  Right.  And they're saying that they need, shut up.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  I'll come back later.  They put their signs on a front lawn.  That's how you get elected when you're a councilman.  Yeah.  That's their advertising.  Yeah.  On a front lawn.  Vote for me.  Well, here we go.  Here's the city councilman.  Here's the city councilman.  It's the wrong message.  Have you lost all shame?  Is there nothing you won't stoop to?  What will you market next? 
[00:48:00]  Uh-oh.  Pedophile peanut butter?  How about gang rape grape juice?  How about genocide jelly?  Okay.  Wait.  He forgot my, the one that I've been working on, which is a new liquor drink called Jigaboos.  And go.  Oh, my God.  Pedophile peanut butter.  Pedophile peanut butter.  He's taking it seriously like he's, like he's doing an MLK speech. 
[00:48:30]  Pedophile peanut butter.  How about cigarettes aimed at our youth called nicotine?  Pedophile peanut butter.  Of course, there's no chunky.  It's all smooth.  I got to hear that again.  The last part.  This guy's out of his freaking full of genocide jelly.  I'm not sure.  I want to hear all of them.  It was pedophile peanut butter. 
[00:49:00]  And he says it with such a, like he's being so dramatic.  Like a little pause.  And then, oh, they're going to love this one.  Oh, they're going to love this one.  Let me write another one.  All the kids will go to school and order a peanut butter and tears sandwich.  Can I have a peanut butter and shattered dream sandwich, please?  What if boss writes for this guy?  Someone on their.  It was a pedophile peanut butter gag.  Someone from their cell phone.  Above 114th Street.  Well, this is the product.  Sickle cell shakes are selling like. 
[00:49:30]  Well, you know.  And then they got Mike from Jersey.  How about herpes, lip balm?  Bill from Waterford.  Crossburning cider.  And Bert from Philly.  I want some Bored Op.  What?  Billions?  Oh, Bored Op.  Billions.  That was not.  That was.  That's just hurtful.  Yeah.  That's just hurtful.  Let's go to Ryan in Smithtown.  Ryan.  Hey, I got the mascot for that gang rape grape soda.  Yeah. 
[00:50:00]  It's the grapest.  The grapest.  That's pretty good.  All right.  Here's the.  It's the grapest.  Here's the.  Yes.  It's just a D.  It's a G dash with rape.  Rape.  Yeah.  G-rape.  Grape.  I don't know why I had to spell it out in order.  Let's go to Nick in Wisconsin.  Nick.  How about some shwuggy champagne?  Let's go to Scott in Massachusetts.  Scott.  Hey, Norton said the best one.  The chunky.  See, it's of course it's smooth and not chunky. 
[00:50:30]  Of course.  And if you would have said it like he did, maybe it would have been funny.  Thank you, Scott.  Cross me.  Cross me.  Cross me.  No, no, no.  You put the punchline first, which is always good.  And then you kind of fill in the blanks.  Right.  That's always the way a good joke comes off.  They own it.  Well, the Jews came and then they walked in the bar because they were part owners.  It was a horse.  I saw long in the face.  Hey, empty boat.  Well, you see, what was the best thing that ever?  All right, here we go.  Here's the councilman again.  All right, we got pedophile peanut butter. 
[00:51:00]  Right.  Genocide juice.  Jelly, I think.  Genocide jelly.  What the hell is that?  I don't know.  That is dope.  He's just a dope idiot.  Sends the wrong message.  Have you lost all shame?  Is there nothing you won't stoop to?  What will you market next?  Pedophile peanut butter?  How about gang rape grape juice?  Gang rape.  How about genocide jelly?  Gang rape. 
[00:51:30]  He's got a rule, though.  He's got a rule.  It's got to be the same sound for the crime as the beginning of whatever product.  Like, this guy is really acting like a nitpicky.  Wait.  That would be nitwit.  Yeah.  Nitpicky nitwit.  This is what I taught Jimmy.  Holy Jesus, Palomino.  Oh.  Oh.  You're going to market candor towards our black moot youth. 
[00:52:00]  Oh.  Oh, black moot.  Oh, boy.  You're going to call it kundi?  Oh, yeah.  We got one on, uh...  Jesus.  Wow.  On Hal Dog.  Holocaust hummus.  Oof.  Yeah, people, it's very hard to get out of the, uh...  Oh, my God.  I can't...  Genocide jelly.  This could be the line of the year if he does it right. 
[00:52:30]  All right.  Let's say hi to John the trucker.  John.  Hey, fellas.  Hey.  Hey, you got your monkey peanut butter, uh...  Your genocide jelly.  Oh.  Wow.  Wow.  He really went off script.  You went off script.  What happened to...  He had something written down, and it was almost good.  What happened to, hey, you got your monkey chocolate in my pedophile peanut butter?  It's five o'clock in the morning, and I'm in the Midwest, and I just woke up, kids.  All right.  All right, John.  You had a great line, though.  I know it. 
[00:53:00]  All right.  Have a good day.  I'm going to punch it out, too.  Bye.  More on the, uh, the cocaine drink.  They don't know what to do.  I want some pedophile peanut butter.  All right.  Hold on a second.  It's endorsed by a certain congressman.  He certainly is.  Loves to spread it on.  Never bread.  Some on the council want to crack down on cocaine sales.  Ban it.  New York City bars.  Personally, I think that it's a bad promotion to just have a name like that. 
[00:53:30]  Life.  But even so, I don't think the city or any government should intervene.  We're in the United States.  You know, it's freedom.  It's a harmless...  Freedom.  You really think you're free in America?  You dope.  Perception.  That's so stupid.  Will you stop with, we're free in America?  United States.  You know, it's freedom.  It's, it's, it's a harmless thing.  It's a, it's a, it's a piece to talk about.  Um, I think that's absurd. 
[00:54:00]  Absolutely absurd.  Well, right now it's unclear what the city will ultimately do about cocaine.  As far as the taste, some people say they love it.  Some people say they hate it.  I can tell you for sure, it has a little bit of a burn.  Oh, he drank some.  Good.  Yeah.  That's good.  He should be doing the real cocaine.  Yeah.  Because of the fatty.  The looks of him.  Jesus.  He could, uh, he, he could lose a few.  Nah, that guy, that guy just went off. 
[00:54:30]  Oh, Marky boy went to rehab, huh?  You know he was thinking about, he thought about it all night.  What could I come up with?  What could I come up with?  Grapes.  Grape jelly.  Gang rape.  Gang rape.  Gang rape.  Gang rape.  Uh.  Grapes.  Let's say it.  Peanut butter.  Let's say it.  Pedophile.  Peanut, pedophile's a pee.  I need someone to pee.  Pedophile.  Pistachios.  No, that's not good.  Pedophile.  Pedophile.  Fluffer nutter.  Peanut butter.  Oh, he doesn't know what the pee-pee thing. 
[00:55:00]  What an ass.  What a horse's ass.  But all I'm going to tell you, there's nothing I would like to have more than some pedophile  peanut butter.  See it all over the, um, shelves of the supermarkets.  Sure.  Let's go to Pinchy.  Pinchy, what's up?  Hey, I got one for Ant.  Final solution, french fries.  Yeah, I don't know if this bit's going to work.  No, it doesn't really work unless, I don't think they're going to.  I know, there's just, I don't know. 
[00:55:30]  Didn't work when the guy did it.  It was funny because it doesn't work.  Right, that's, you're 100% right there.  There you go.  Um, yeah, that's, uh, that's, uh, no, don't, I'm looking at a Kuntucky fried chicken.  You guys.  It's better than my Kundi line.  I'll talk.  Kuntucky fried chicken.  Uh, uh, that doesn't even make sense.  We're hoping this bit's going to take off, but. 
[00:56:00]  No.  We're still on the runway.  This, uh, this bit tried to take off on the short, dark runway and hit a farmhouse.  Not even.  We're just, uh.  An investigation is in progress.  We're on the runway.  We're waiting.  We're waiting.  I don't think so.  We're going to have to go back to the, um, back to the terminal.  This plane has mechanical difficulties.  Slavery, uh, salsa.  All right.  That's almost funny.  Um.  Slavery salsa.  Sodomy soda.  Hmm. 
[00:56:30]  No.  All right.  It's good with the can.  It could work in the can somehow.  What?  It's in sodomy soda.  Like the old catchphrase and slogan could be something with the can.  Oh, yeah.  I said it three times.  I like that.  No, no.  I actually, I do like that.  In a can.  Uh, yeah.  Huh.  All right. 
[00:57:00]  I couldn't be happier than this guy getting busted.  All right.  Oh, I know.  It's Foley.  I can't be happier today.  Well, Foley is just, he's just terrific.  Yeah, we ought to, uh.  Oh, he's in deep trouble.  Go through a couple of his...  Well, what's this Mark Foley and John Walsh from America's Most Wanted?  Uh-oh.  What was this about?  I'm sure they're not the best of friends anymore.  Is this old audio?  We got Thang coming to the mic.  Yes, Thang.  I love the old audio of a hypocrite.  Where did we find this?  This is on YouTube. 
[00:57:30]  Danny brought it in, so he might be able to describe it better, but I think it's an old...  Here he comes.  By the way, again, I just have to point out and always, always tip my hat to Thang.  I'm not sure.  Something comes in, always willing to pass the buck a little.  This is Danny.  Hold on.  I'm going to use this phone call to segue into Mark Foley, okay?  All right.  Eric in Princeton.  That's right.  You've got your Foley fudge in my pedophile peanut butter. 
[00:58:00]  That's the joke.  Now we can move on to Mark Foley.  Thanks, Eric.  So what's this audio, Danny?  It's a clip of Foley talking to John Walsh on America's Most Wanted about passing some bill.  Of registered sex offenders.  It just gets a little ironic towards the end.  Isn't it ironic, don't you think?  So this is old audio?  Yeah, I'm not sure how old, but it's old.  All right.  We track library books better than we track pedophiles and kids that are missing. 
[00:58:30]  We've got to force states to incorporate technology, share information, because we can't take another loss of life of a child.  Absolutely correct.  I believe that every convicted felon should be mandated nationwide to give as DNA.  It solves crimes.  It gets innocent people out of prison.  And it will eliminate the ability of these people to roam state to state in this country and rape people.  From my view, when you rape a person, when you violate a child, you lose your civil liberties. 
[00:59:00]  Anybody that says we shouldn't take DNA samples, absolutely wrong.  You commit the crime, you will supply the sample, and we'll be able to track and hopefully solve a lot of crimes.  Well, good luck with your piece of legislation, because you're right.  It will put some teeth into these registries.  Well, if I were one of these sickos, I'd be nervous with America's Most Wanted on my trail.  I wish I could catch all of them.  Oh, if I were one of these sickos. 
[00:59:30]  Hey, you are.  If I was one of these sickos.  Did you hear how nervous he sounded saying that?  That was his inner thoughts coming out.  Like, I can't believe I'm saying this.  I'm going to hunt.  Oh, my God.  Oh, they're going to get me.  Oh, my God.  America's Most Wanted is going to find me.  And he put himself in rehab now like it was alcohol.  Oh, it's the same thing that, what's his name, did from Entertainment Tonight or whatever that.  Oh, Pat O'Brien.  Pat O'Brien did it.  Mel Gibson did it when he went off.  At least he was legitimately drunk when he got pulled over. 
[01:00:00]  Yeah, but they all, it's just, oh, my God, it was the alcohol.  If it wasn't for the alcohol, I wouldn't have been IMing this kid.  You know something?  Shut up.  I've never had a few drinks and thought, well, let me get into a sexually explicit email conversation with a young boy.  I know.  I don't need any booze.  Absolutely.  Sober is better because you don't make spelling mistakes.  Give me those rib, you.  LOL.  Oh, Jimmy.  Always poke too hard.  We have some more. 
[01:00:30]  Yeah, we certainly do.  Really sexy dialogue between us two.  Sexy.  I don't know what to start with, the page or the staple page.  Do we start with, what about this, talking about the nude camps?  Oh, that's a good one, too.  It's all the same story, so.  Which one do you want to do?  We could just, we could just dive in anywhere we want.  We got the latest audio where he's blaming booze.  Let's hear how he's blaming booze, I think.  You want to start with that?  Yeah, I'd like to hear his voice.  It gets a little more of his personality into it. 
[01:01:00]  All right, here's the latest on Mark Foley.  The best way I can describe how Mark is doing is that he is completely devastated by letting  his community, his family, his political party, his constituents, and his country down.  He was extremely depressed, but his concern is not for himself.  Of course not.  His concern is for the damage that his actions have caused to others.  Just kill yourself.  Shut up, you got caught. 
[01:01:30]  His concern is for what's on his hard drive that the FBI is going through right now.  His wife always wondered why whenever his computer turned on, it would play ba-ba-ba-ba-hey.  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  A couple of who songs.  He's got his computer down to itty-bitty parts by now.  Oh, he's just.  No part bigger than a speck of rice.  He's got hammers and saws and magnets.  Oh, honey, destroy the computer. 
[01:02:00]  Can we please do this one here?  Which one?  Yeah, yeah, we'll close.  Wait, let's get back.  All right, this is the rest of the attorney speaking.  Just a bunch of horse crap.  He is absolutely positively not a pedophile.  He is apologetic for the communications that he made while under the influence of alcohol,  which he acknowledges are totally inappropriate and are not the product of the Mark Foley  the sober and healthy Mark Foley, but are the product of someone under the influence of alcohol 
[01:02:30]  and suffering from mental illness.  Well, again, let's bring this back to how we started this show.  If alcohol is this detrimental and makes people do things that are this dangerous,  why isn't it illegal?  Yes, they didn't say Mark was Internet gambling, and then all of a sudden he talked to a young boy  and appropriately drunk, so why not go out to booze?  Yeah.  Why doesn't President Bush sign something about that?  Right.  He's had his own problems with booze. 
[01:03:00]  He knows how bad and dangerous it is.  My God.  Bush is an ass.  I'd like to grab his lapels.  Really?  Oh, shake him.  What is more dangerous to the kids, though?  Is it violent video games, online gambling, or booze and drugs?  I'd say, uh...  Yeah.  None.  It's Representative Foley.  Representative Foley.  And a pair of sweats.  Math 54.  But let's see the politicians go after the booze. 
[01:03:30]  It'd be insane to do that.  We're just starting here with Mark Foley.  Why don't we take a break?  And we'll continue.  Mark Foley.  I don't want to play, but there's one beep.  Can we play it going into break, though, maybe?  Remember I was talking about School for Scoundrels.  We had John Heater on our couch.  You know, the dude that played Napoleon Dynamite.  Of course.  And the new movie, he does it with Billy Bob Thornton. 
[01:04:00]  And he was discussing on our show how they went into their old characters,  Napoleon Dynamite.  I mean, John Heater did his Napoleon Dynamite character.  Yep.  And Billy Bob Thornton did Carl from Sling Blade.  Sling Blade.  And John Heater was telling me, or us, it was going to be on the DVD as part of the extras.  It's already on YouTube.  It's hilarious.  Yeah, just to hear Billy Bob Thornton do that character again, it's really cool.  I don't care what he says.  Like, that character's voice just is funny to hear.  Right.  So, you know, they just decided to do a little dialogue back and forth. 
[01:04:30]  A little riffing.  A little riffing off the cuff.  And it's going to be on the DVD, but you've got to love YouTube.  It's already up there.  There's one beep at the end of it.  We're playing it on this side of the show, so please bear with us.  We want to play this going into break, okay?  Yeah.  John Heater and Billy Bob Thornton.  My boy told us we just going to have some french fried potatoes and them tater tots to eat for dinner.  I didn't see none, did you?  No.  The catering guy said there were some tater tots down in the room during lunchtime. 
[01:05:00]  I kept a few in my pocket, then these buttheads ate them all.  I was freaking starving.  You still have that llama or that goat or whatever you had there a while ago?  You're talking about Tina?  I recognize her name.  No, we had to give away to Lyle the farm because her milk always tasted like hay.  It was freaking gross. 
[01:05:30]  So, are you like mentally retarded or something?  Yes, sir, but all us mentally retarded boys have real big peckers.  What's a pecker?  Is that like some kind of bird of prey?  Well, the way the girls put it, it's a gargashuan.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Coming October 4th.  This place is in a quandary and there will be major changes. 
[01:06:00]  An announcement that will forever change the future of the Opie and Anthony Show.  Oh, what are we going to do next?  Who will go?  Whatever.  Who will stay?  I just thought you were going to some kind of a change.  You asked.  XM, listen.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Find out October 4th.  Let's get right back into our favorite congressman.  Well.  Oh, get back into talking about him.  Yeah.  Okay.  Sorry. 
[01:06:30]  Well, in light of certain events and stuff, I thought the meaning was, well, you understand.  Very good, Anthony.  You're the quick one.  What?  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  So the dude is blaming alcohol at this point, right?  Yeah.  You know, you got it at that point.  You can do horrific things in America as long as you got the alcohol to fall back on.  Blame the booze.  Go into rehab.  You come out.  Hope everything's hunky-dory.  And for the most part, you get a second chance if you go through the rehab and then show 
[01:07:00]  everyone that you're better now.  Pat O'Brien's fine now.  Oh, I know.  He's back on one of those entertainment shows.  I can never remember which one.  The Insider.  The Insider.  Is that the one he's on?  Yeah.  I watch every night, actually.  And yeah, he's back on there.  There's no repercussions, no nothing.  He's doing the same shtick he did for years, and that's it.  He's fine.  He made it through that.  Oof.  And this guy is making people uncomfortable he's talking to online. 
[01:07:30]  It's amazing.  Oh, yeah.  You can see that the guy is uncomfortable.  I'm a pervert online, but this guy is obviously making people really uncomfortable.  Yep.  How imperceptive is this dope that no one's enjoying his chat?  All right.  Well, here's more audio.  Mark is an alcoholic.  He drank in secret.  He did not drink in public.  He had two lives with regard to his...  Wow, do you think he doesn't even drink?  The guy doesn't drink, and they went the alcohol route.  That's what I am thinking here. 
[01:08:00]  Do you think, yeah.  He went to his attorney's office and was like, you got to help me.  This is my whole career going down the toilet here.  Like, he never had a drink out in public.  He went, you know, all these congressmen go to these meetings, parties, things,  and he's just kind of sitting there, what, sipping a little club soda.  Yeah, a little teetotaling.  Well, they got to blame it on something.  Guess what else he drank in private.  The old bleach breath. 
[01:08:30]  Mark is an alcoholic.  I'll have the Mitch daiquiri.  Mark is an alcoholic.  He drank in secret.  He did not drink in public.  He had two lives with regard to his alcohol consumption.  In public and in public service, he was sober.  When he was alone, he was not sober.  What I can tell you is that, based on all the information that I have, 
[01:09:00]  Mark Foley has never, ever had an inappropriate sexual contact with a minor in his life.  Here's a scumbag lawyer protecting himself, based on all the information I have.  Yeah, yeah, here it is.  He's not even, you know, believing his client.  Here's my disclaimer.  Right.  Based on all the information I have, why not just make it a statement, you scumbag?  Yeah, he's paying me very well, so I have to say this, but I've got to cover my own ass.  The information I have, which is the information this pervert gave me. 
[01:09:30]  Right.  And that's all the information I have.  He sent it to me in an instant message with a photo of his genitals.  Oh, this Foley gets really fired up quick, doesn't he?  CC'd to a middle school.  Oh, he's a naughty one.  The recent tragic events that led to Mark's recognition that he is ill,  and that his alcoholism and mental illness are beyond his control, 
[01:10:00]  reached a crisis point on Friday.  We have tried to respond to that crisis, and as you all know,  at this point, Mark has been admitted into an alcoholism,  substance abuse, and mental health facility as an inpatient,  and we anticipate that he will be there a minimum of 30 days,  and possibly, if not probably longer.  If he wants, I can get him out.  I know the tricks.  I know the tricks of the trade. 
[01:10:30]  What mental illness, though?  How is he crazy?  I don't know what happened.  I saw a penis.  I mistook it for a Pez candy dispenser.  They can't go this route on this one.  It's not going to work like it does with entertainers,  where they can go into a rehab thing, say it was alcoholism.  The guy apparently wasn't drinking outside of his house.  What?  He'd go home, plunk the bottle down, start drinking, go online, 
[01:11:00]  and have these inappropriate conversations with these teenage boys,  who, by the way, he also had physical contact with at the workplace.  It wasn't like these were random people on the Internet that he never then visited  or drove up to that house with the Dateline guy, that kind of situation.  He knew these people through work.  He spoke with them face-to-face.  He had private time with them. 
[01:11:30]  I would gather, if they were his page, they take messages.  They run errands.  So he is having physical contact.  He is within this guy's realm of space, you know, to reach out and touch.  How is this alcohol bull crap going to, uh, it's not going to fly with this guy?  Mark is contrite, remorseful, and devastated by the harm that his actions... 
[01:12:00]  Yeah.  Contrite?  Mark is contrite.  Contrite?  Devastated, horny.  Horny, lonely.  I mean, uh...  Well, at the beginning with his 1993 sponsorship of a measure of the Florida state legislator  to seize the cars of men who solicit prostitutes,  former restaurant owner and real estate agent Mark Foley  repeatedly attracted a flattering political spotlight  by, uh, invading, uh, against those involved in sexual crimes 
[01:12:30]  and presenting himself as a protector of exploited children.  What a scumbag.  Foley, as chairman of the Missing and Exploited Children's Caucus,  had introduced legislation in July to protect children from exploitation by adults over the internet.  He also sponsored other legislation designed to protect minors from abuse and neglect.  He just wanted to knock down his competition.  Right.  He wanted to...  Get out of here.  He was doing all that to increase his odds.  Leave my boys alone. 
[01:13:00]  Right.  And since he wanted...  More for me.  Woo-ha-ha-ha-ha.  He wanted cars taken for prostitution.  Yeah.  Because that's what...  Okay, well, how about we take your house?  Because that's where you were sometimes when you made these inappropriate conversations.  Shouldn't lose his home.  This son of a bitch should be run through every single law that he tried to or had passed.  He should be run through every single one of them.  He's a predator, an online predator, and he should be treated just like the ones you see on, uh, the Dateline specials. 
[01:13:30]  Brought in jail, booked, photographed, his life destroyed, the whole deal.  Another dirtbag, moralist, conservative.  Oh, it makes me...  Yeah.  Moral.  Your morality.  Let's go to West Palm.  Gary?  Hey, good morning, Owen.  Good morning.  What's up, Gary?  I don't know about you, gentlemen, but I'm about 38 years old, and I've been getting hammered, you know, almost all my life.  And I've never got that hammered where I needed to email someone and ask them for a job and things such like that.  How about you guys?  He cleaned it up for the radio, yeah.  He's been drinking his whole life, and he's never gone online and asked a little boy for a blank job, yes. 
[01:14:00]  Never.  Never.  There you go.  I don't know.  I've just never been that drunk to start emailing little boys.  Well, speak for yourself, because sometimes you just come out of a blackout, and there you are chit-chatting with little Frank, too.  Yeah.  I knew they were going to throw this spin on him with the alcohol crap.  I just knew it was coming, man.  It's like everybody else has got to, you know...  Hey, dude, I'm actually coming to West Palm this week.  I'm really psyched that all this attention is being focused on Mr. Foley.  Can't wait to chat about him. 
[01:14:30]  Oh, yeah.  Talk about him.  He's a dirty boy.  He's a silly goose.  Oh, old Dirty Mark?  Sure we know about him.  Filthy Mark.  Creepy old Mr. Foley?  Jim Norton, you're going to be in West Palm Beach?  Yeah, I leave Thursday.  Improv?  Yeah.  Very cool.  He was a restaurant owner.  Yeah.  Yes.  What a guy.  I bet he'd love to hire those young waiters.  Give them a nice cannoli on the cheek.  Oh.  All right, Mark Foley.  Just served sausage.  He's devastated.  Let's see what else he is here, okay?  Mark is contrite.  Contrite.  Remorseful.  Remorseful. 
[01:15:00]  And devastated by the harm that his actions have caused to others and has taken and takes  full responsibility for those actions.  He blames no one but himself.  I hope not.  I hope and pray that we all remember the dedicated public servant that Mark Foley has been over  his entire adult lifetime and his contribution to his community and his country.  It's a lawyer, man.  You hear him?  He's devastated. 
[01:15:30]  You know he practiced this in front of a mirror in his lawyer's office.  Dude!  He's devastated, dude!  You know his career's gone, dude!  You think, you know he's got to go in front of the press, so he's probably in his office  in front of a mirror going, he's deva-  Oh, wait, wait, wait.  Take time.  He's deva-  Devastated.  Just to get it right, I got to talk monotone to show that Mark Foley is devastated by this. 
[01:16:00]  And then he goes, I hope and pray.  Do you really pray?  He's praying for him.  You pray for, like, what?  Maybe, say, the families and the whole Amish thing, and you pray for, what, terror victims?  Yeah.  And that we remember that he was a public servant.  Those are the three things you toss into your prayers, stupid.  I hope and pray that the check clears.  All right.  There we go.  Hallelujah. 
[01:16:30]  That's all the lawyers care about.  Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee.  Blessed art thou amongst women, and blessed is the fruit, Mark Foley.  Wait, no, no.  That's not right.  Blessed are the fruit of the looms of 16-year-olds.  Wait a minute.  You know what the lawyers are all about.  That phone call comes in, sir, Mark Foley's on the line.  Are you biting your hand and jumping up and down before you take the call?  Like, oh, my God, he called me.  Here it comes.  Payday.  Payday.  Payday.  That's what he's thinking.  And it's a typical statement. 
[01:17:00]  Okay, Mark, sit down.  Let's go over this.  What did you do?  Get all the info.  Okay, the first thing we've got to do now is put out a statement.  Right.  Do you drink?  No.  Okay.  We're going to go with the drinking angle here, though.  You've never been seen drinking in public?  No, I don't drink.  Okay, all right.  You're drinking the privacy of you.  Have you ever, ever had a drink in your home?  Wink, wink.  You know what I'm saying.  Oh, yeah, yeah, okay.  Yeah, I have.  Okay, all right.  And you're drinking at home.  You're in front of the computer. 
[01:17:30]  Perhaps maybe your judgment is a little clouded.  That's how lawyers work.  I can't say it, but you know what I'm getting at here.  All right.  Yes.  We got a transcript for today?  Counselor.  We do.  These are coming in like crazy, huh?  We got a lot of them now.  Like hot cakes.  It's a shorts tenter.  Yeah.  You want to start with this one, Jimmy?  Yeah, there's a couple of different... 
[01:18:00]  Which one do you want to do, Sweetie Pie?  This one?  Yeah.  First?  Single sheet, sure.  Yeah.  There's a couple of different chats, it looks like, on the same paper.  They took excerpts from a couple of different inappropriate moments of chats.  Makes it all the sexier, doesn't it?  Sure it does.  Who's playing who today?  I want to be the lad.  Yes, Jimmy will again be playing the lad.  I will play the part of Mr. Foley.  Math 54.  And I'm a bunch of exes.  You're just exes.  To protect my identity.  Hey, where's my script?  I like my mom. 
[01:18:30]  You could be our narrator.  You're a long-suffering narrator.  Thank you, sir.  Long-suffering narrator.  All right, let's go.  Okay, let me see.  Hold on.  Okay, that's working, just in case.  You never know.  Oh, I start this one off at 8.03 and 47 seconds p.m.  I ask, what are you wearing?  That's the first thing.  That's it.  What are you wearing? 
[01:19:00]  Normal clothes.  T-shirts and shorts.  Love to slip them off you.  In your shorts and polo shirt?  No, athletic shorts and T-shirt.  Had soccer practice today.  Mmm, nice.  Jock strap too?  Not in soccer.  Of course, if you weren't listening yesterday, Jim is playing the, he's acting out the L-O-L. 
[01:19:30]  Yeah, L-O-L.  Laugh out loud.  What do you wear, then?  Just our boxers and shorts.  Good.  And then, I don't know, I guess maybe the UPS guy or the Federal Express guy or somebody  came to the kid's house, because now the congressman is asking, shows your package then? 
[01:20:00]  Yeah, slow things down a little, I'm still young.  Like under 18, don't want to do anything illegal.  I'm not 18 till Feb 23.  I know.  Nothing will happen, just dreaming.  You're horny, though.  Well, yeah, a bit.  But I'm still a virgin.  You're in your boxers, too?  Nope, just got home. 
[01:20:30]  We'll strip down and get relaxed.  Now, how does he, let me, here's a word of advice for any internet perverts.  If you're ever talking dirty to someone online, and they say, I'm still young, like under  18, don't want to do anything illegal, run, Forrest, run!  They're not turned on.  Yeah, they're not turned on.  Um, they're not wanting you.  Or interested, when I'm turned on, I don't fire out statutes.  Yeah. 
[01:21:00]  It's against the law, you know.  I'd prefer not to.  What if there was the police looking?  Knocking down mailboxes, driving through people's backyards.  Had a girl in the car.  That's a man act.  Showed off a package.  That's a man act.  That's a man act.  I happen to have my young son in the car.  Could you put him on the phone?  Let's say hi to Dean in Philly.  You looked a lot younger on the internet.  Let's go to Dean in Philly.  Dean.  Oh, hey, what's going on?  Hey.  Hey, I don't know about you guys.  I haven't seen the transcript.  But when I'm smashing them at my computer, I can't even hit the right keys, let alone 
[01:21:30]  try to have a conversation on the computer.  Well, there are some misspellings, but not like intoxicated misspellings.  These look like worked up into a lather.  Yeah.  Misspellings.  Yeah, this is like you can't hit the button fast enough.  Yeah.  Or you can only type right.  You have like one hand you're working on.  Yeah, you're probably one-handed typing.  Try typing lefty.  You're going to hit a few wrong keys.  You're just losing focus.  Can't really see the keys that well.  All right.  You guys start.  All right.  Let's say hi to Dave once to defend the guy. 
[01:22:00]  Dave.  Well, that's what I was going to say.  You said that the transcripts were misspelled and everything else, so I was going to say he could  use that as a defense that he really was drunk.  There's anyone in a chat room that doesn't misspell a lot of stuff.  Right.  It just happens in chat rooms.  You just.  Oh, yeah.  An alcoholic that's offended.  Charisse in Florida.  Oh, Jesus.  Charisse.  I bet she's offended that this guy's using the excuse.  Is it a guy?  Charisse.  Yes, I'm here.  Hi, Charisse.  Hi, Charisse.  Hi. 
[01:22:30]  What's your issue?  Well, I don't know if you know this, but down here in West Palm Beach, there's a huge  recovery community.  There's tons of rehab.  He might even be in a rehab down here.  Most likely, they shipped them out of state to get them out of sight, but this is like  called recovery capital of the world, and there's a lot of people that are trying to  change their life from alcohol and drugs, and I work in that field, and I really, you  know, it offends me that he's hiding behind the alcoholism cloak that so many people do, 
[01:23:00]  saying it was all because he was drunk.  That's bullshit.  My cloak of alcoholism.  The cloak of alcoholism.  Too damaged.  Too damaged.  Can't get through my cloak.  Plus, it removes the excuse.  Go ahead.  You talk.  Why would I chime in?  Go ahead.  It's all about you.  Sorry.  I didn't mean to chime into the Charisse show.  Go right ahead, Charisse.  It's just ridiculous that he's, you know, hiding behind this, and, you know, it's just  wrong.  You know something, Charisse? 
[01:23:30]  I'm just spending a lot of people that are in this country here.  Well, or not.  Yeah, why not?  He must be a really good counselor.  Well, I'm kind of feeling well here.  You know, I'm really kind of sad now.  Me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me.  Well, I hope your guest uses this full force in his comedy routine.  Life and young boys aren't too pretty.  Wait, I'm not a guest.  Oh, I thought you had a comic on the show.  Oh, I am, but I'm not a guest.  I'm more of what you'd call I have my fingernails dug into two coattails.  Oh, really?  I'm more of a drag victim. 
[01:24:00]  Indirect nepotism, huh?  Hey, Charisse, were you more exciting when you were drinking?  What?  I think I was more of an asshole when I was drinking, yeah, you know.  No, actually, I was one of those drunks that got depressed and pitiful.  Wait, but what do you – I don't know what you mean.  What is indirect nepotism?  Indirect nepotism.  Oh, well, if he's hanging out to your coattails, is he relative?  All right, thank you, Charisse.  Thank you. 
[01:24:30]  Thank you for your call.  You're an inspiration to all people trying to get sober.  What else we got here?  You too can lose your funny bone in rehab.  Oh, my God.  Sorry about that.  We'll have to remove her funny bone.  Hey, why don't you stop drinking while they get all that excitement out of your voice?  No more fun for you.  Yeah, we got a little more of an exchange.  And this one shows really kind of how uncomfortable the young boy is getting.  Well, you have to read the lead-up, too, because this Mark Foley just doesn't give up. 
[01:25:00]  Emails show Foley sought to rendezvous with Paige, with one of the pages.  In addition to explicit sexual language, former Congressman Mark Foley's internet messages  also include repeated efforts to get the underage recipient to rendezvous with him at night.  I would drive a few miles for a hot stud like you, Foley said in one message obtained by ABC News.  Who says hot stud?  Hot stud.  An old pedophile says that.  And it's the alcohol that made him say that. 
[01:25:30]  A hot stud.  You got nice buns.  Oh, great.  He's getting his dialogue from the Golden Girls.  You're really buff, you ass.  What a douche.  The FBI says it's opened a preliminary investigation of Foley's emails.  Federal law enforcement officials say attempts by Foley to meet in person could constitute  the necessary evidence for a federal charge of soliciting for sex with a minor on the internet.  Soliciting for sex with a minor on the internet.  In addition, another message, Foley, using the screen name, of course, MAF54, 
[01:26:00]  appears to describe having been together with the teen in San Diego.  And it starts, of course, with the wonderful congressman saying,  I miss you lots since San Diego.  Yeah, I can't wait till D.C.  You don't sound like a teenager, Jimmy.  Yeah, I can't wait till D.C.  MAF54, smiley face.  That's all he writes. 
[01:26:30]  Smiley face, clown hat.  Right.  Did you pick a night for dinner?  Not yet, but likely Friday.  Okay.  I'll plan for Friday then.  That'll be fun.  The message also shows the teen is at times uncomfortable with Foley's aggressive approach.  I want to see you.  Like I said,  not till February.  Then we will go to dinner.  And then what happens? 
[01:27:00]  We eat.  We drink.  Who knows?  Hang out.  Later to the night.  And...  I don't know.  Don't know what.  Just say it.  Say it.  I have a feeling that you're fishing here.  I'm not sure what I'd be comfortable with.  We'll see.  See what?  He just probably...  Ah, see what?  Don't know what?  See what?  Say the word.  CK words are sexy.  Yeah, fully resigned Friday after ABC News questioned him about the internet messages. 
[01:27:30]  Says he's checked into rehab to deal with his alcohol and behavioral issues.  What a gray-haired fruit.  Oh.  This guy could...  He's buff.  This guy could easily kill himself.  He drank later tonight.  And...  I don't know.  Don't know what.  Right.  What don't you know, son?  Feeling uncomfortable.  Uncomfortable how?  Too big for your shorts, are you?  And then Lowdown in the Daily News today from Foley, naked display of weirdness.  And they got some excerpts of Foley going on a lot of TV shows. 
[01:28:00]  Yeah.  And Lowdown has unearthed some of Foley's weirder whoppers from his relentless June 2003 campaign  against child-oriented nudist camps in Florida.  What's a Foley whopper?  Have it your way, young.  We need to know more about these nudist camps for teenagers in Florida.  Nudist camps in Florida.  All right.  He really took this on during his 2003 campaign. 
[01:28:30]  He was obsessed with the child-oriented nudist camps in Florida.  Now, this is new to me.  This is something I don't know about.  I don't know if it's a big thing.  I know there are nudists.  To him it is.  I don't know.  I know there are nudist camps out there.  I know that parents and their children go to them.  It's something that's beyond me.  I couldn't imagine this actually happening.  I don't know what the legalities are. 
[01:29:00]  We're on in Florida.  Someone help us out with the child-oriented nudist camps.  But for him to dive headfirst into this whole thing, figuratively speaking, unfortunately for him,  I would think this investigation for him would involve looking at pictures, reading about things like this, and probably turned him on so much that that's why a lot of these people get into these positions where they're able to do these things.  They have access to all the information.  They have access.  This guy can legitimately and legally, as a head of this committee, walk in and peruse as much kiddie porn as he wants. 
[01:29:30]  I need to see all pictures from the child-oriented nudist camps.  Show me what's going on in these camps.  I want pictures.  I want reports.  I want dialogue.  And he gets it.  He already had the gay, and I guess if you're a politician, there's a whole list of things you could go after.  Right.  And he goes, well, I'm going to go after the nudist colonies in Florida.  Lucky me. 
[01:30:00]  Look what's on the list that I could go after.  All right, sir.  You sure you want to put that on the top of your list?  Yes.  Honey, you seem to be working a lot of hours later.  I work nights every day.  Honey, it's 3 in the morning.  Could you come to bed?  I'm busy at the computer.  I have to shut down child-oriented nudist camps.  What about port security?  There's a 15-year-old and a 16-year-old mingling in the nude, playing volleyball.  They need help. 
[01:30:30]  Frolicking in the woods.  They're flying a kite nude.  Frolicking.  And they're not using their hands.  We have to do something.  So now take your bosom and that other thing to bed with you.  That's great.  I'll be there eventually.  I'll have no part of it.  I got more research to do.  Take that dumpster with the Davy Crockett hat on it and go to bed.  All right. 
[01:31:00]  Game over for the day.  Oh, wow.  Damn it.  I was looking good, too.  I was confident, too.  Oh, my God.  So early in the show, too.  Ah, why bother?  There is no God.  Yeah, it's obviously already had the gay.  Well, yeah.  And then went after us.  Young boys.  Soft issues.  Wow. 
[01:31:30]  Ah.  That's not funny.  Thank you.  That's really funny, Jimmy.  Let's say hi to Cat in New Jersey.  Cat.  Hey, how you doing, guys?  Hey.  I have to say my favorite part of the whole coverage was on ABC the first night I read the transcript.  Yeah.  They cut to Scott's video of man hands typing.  Then they go back to the anchor.  Then they go back to the typing.  And he's typing with one hand.  Oh, that's cool.  Oh, really?  They had him one hand typing?  Full body cringe.  That's good.  That's really good.  B in the Bronx.  B?  Hey, hi, guys.  Hi, B.  The funniest thing ever. 
[01:32:00]  Could you please get back to reading those emails?  They're so dead.  Yeah.  Do we have any more?  I don't really have those.  We don't have any more.  Travis is like a champ.  Travis is searching them out.  Searching it out.  He's been the victim of a few of them.  I know.  He's getting them out of his personal email.  He's like, oh, wait, wait.  This is mine.  Travis is XXXXXXX.  Change Travis to XXXXXXX.  Keep it up, guys.  You are the best.  Thank you.  All right.  I've actually, when I'm online.  Yeah, he slipped up on one.  It says, I miss you lots in San Diego, Travis. 
[01:32:30]  I have.  Because I'm a righty, so what I have to do is, like, I'm looking online.  I'm looking what I want to look at.  And I got my mouse on the right.  But let's just say you want to watch something and you realize, like, you can all use one hand.  I'll actually have to take the whole mouse pad and move it to the left and move my keyboard over  so I can mouse with my left hand.  You're ambidextrous with your mouse?  No, no, no, no.  I can function barely with my left hand, but you have to be.  Otherwise, you're going to sully the mouse.  Right.  You're going to sully your mouse.  Nobody wants a mouse with wet fur. 
[01:33:00]  All right.  Listen, we're going to take a break.  When we get back, we're going to find out about these child-oriented nudist camps in Florida.  That's right.  And what Mr. Foley had to say about that on all the news programs.  It's in the Daily News today.  And then we're going to lead into 39 sex offenders in one neighborhood.  We found the neighborhood.  Wait a minute.  We found the neighborhood.  Was this from the story?  Utopia.  No, it's, you know.  Foleyville.  It's how we do the radio show. 
[01:33:30]  Renamed it.  We seg into the next thing, which has to be that.  Population, not enough.  I think we found the neighborhood finally, yes.  So we'll talk about that next.  Great.  Foleyville.  As well.  I wanted to do some homeless radio.  Do we have time to do one homeless radio from Tippi Tom?  He's talking about the morning after pill.  Oh.  For the new listeners, we have a homeless guy, Tippi Tom.  He's quite a card. 
[01:34:00]  He is as homeless as you could get.  He stinks to high heaven.  The ace of ugh.  Yeah, he's got, he's just the real deal.  When you see he stinks, he's drunk.  When you go to the movies.  He has matted.  And Hollywood shows you a homeless guy, that's Tippi Tom.  He's the stereotypical Hollywood homeless guy.  He's a smelly bum.  He's the worst.  And from time to time, we throw him on.  And with Than, they do a radio show together.  Actually, Than just like answers phone calls for him and stuff.  And Tippi Tom just comments on the things that are in the news. 
[01:34:30]  Here he is talking about the morning after pill.  Hey guys, Tom, listen.  Since you're a dad, what is your opinion of RU486 the morning after abortion pill?  Um, the abortion pill?  I'm really against abortion.  I think it's wrong.  And, um, but it's a woman's issue.  It's up, it's her body. 
[01:35:00]  Who am I to judge?  I, I, I, I, I don't like the idea of it.  I think it's wrong, personally.  But, um, I, I, I, I, who am I to say?  It's not my body.  That's a, that's an excellent point.  Who am I?  The Jews, what, who you can.  What, excuse me?  Who am I?  Suppose you get me pregnant.  Oh, please God.  All right.  Who are you to tell me that I can't have this baby or I can't have this baby? 
[01:35:30]  It's my body.  It's in my body.  Wow.  I, I, I, I realized you were saying to choose or something.  Choose.  It sounded like you just went off on the Jews.  Blaming the Jews.  The Jews.  Sounds like his windpipe is full of Jell-O.  Maybe.  Or something.  He's blaming the Jews.  Or something.  He's blaming the Jews.  Maybe he's not that drunk after all. 
[01:36:00]  But, uh, there you go.  We have to pretend that he's pregnant or something like that.  Yeah.  Let's say I get pregnant.  What?  Let's just say I get pregnant.  Really?  Uh, we have time to do one more here.  Uh, Tippi Tom discusses, uh, football.  Football season's starting up, Tom.  You excited about that?  You got a favorite team?  Well, I haven't watched football in a while, but I do like, um, old football when I was,  you know, like, I played football, too, as a kid. 
[01:36:30]  Really?  But, uh, yeah, yeah, in high school.  But, um, the only football player that I really like is O.J. Simpson.  Yeah.  He's American's sweetheart.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, yeah, he kills his wife.  Oh, yeah, that.  Oh, that's good, huh?  No, I didn't know you knew about that.  That happened in the 90s.  Nobody knows about it.  He got out of it.  He had barely had four or five lawyers. 
[01:37:00]  Well, he seemed to know about the case.  He's a babbling ass.  All right, Tippi Tom, Homeless Radio.  We'll continue with, uh, Foley and these child-oriented nudist camps in Florida.

[01:56:00]  wow look our tv commercial god they're playing it like crazy here in new york she's kind of sexy  though she was uh very sexy when she had her regular clothes on she she was not bad at all  dumper she was nice too you can check out the opian anthony commercial on youtube  she was very um she had a good personality all right here's more audio  say what does that look like who do you look like in that um chef from apocalypse now 
[01:56:30]  i'm a saucier i'm a saucier oh that's great there we go get on the boat man the next commercial  should be oh just in like some kind of makeup putting your head in somebody's lap  i hope it's yours jimmy face down as usual give me those ribs hello wow always a little too hard  tickle tickle what a poking going on between you two today oh you know a couple of men just feeling 
[01:57:00]  each other giving each other elbow to the ribs cop and feels more audio teron white knows his  neighborhood well at 16 years old he knows where all the men who are convicted sex offenders live  and how to avoid them mainly you know from this block houses on this side you should stay away  from yeah kind of an odd way to grow up isn't it to to know that there are these people living right  around you oh shut up sounds like a bright boy this creeps in every freaking neighborhood in america 
[01:57:30]  it's like boy you're talking to is armed to the hilt i wouldn't worry about it really he takes care of  himself yeah how do you know which ones to avoid i well there's a couple of houses that have candy  leading up to the front usually avoid those across the street i want to get a lawn chair and  come halloween just out front of this house and see what happens that would be fun to watch i bet  you they got the best candy in the neighborhood all know that there are these people living right  around you yeah of course he grew up this way just as his younger brother and sister have do you keep a 
[01:58:00]  closer eye on your little brother and sister because of all this yeah yeah um they have to  stay right in front of the house did nobody even though this block you may have nothing to worry about  you can walk up and down the block without you know being harassed but you don't go looking for  trouble what are you talking about those guys what you have built-in babysitters you want to go out  for the night just call one of 39 people or put out put an ad out you'll have 39 phone messages 
[01:58:30]  listen i'm going now i need someone to baby come over i'll take care of that i'm away i'm away free  free one cost you a dime i'll pay you i'll pay you i'll pay you i'll bring food i'll bring food i'll  bring a movie i'll bring popcorn i'll put them whatever you say come down uh well this is  interesting the parole boards tell offenders which landlords don't care about their status  they gotta live somewhere if they're out they don't live somewhere that's nice liberal thinking of  you that's right that's good they should live in a little pine apartment with a satin pillow and 
[01:59:00]  face down this mausoleum is a fine house for him sure it's another one yeah who are the landlords  actually that don't care i'd love to rent to a pedophile what's he gonna do complain i don't  have any hot water what'd you say kid toucher i'll be back later gonna raise your rent again  okie-dokie all right whatever these sex offenders are being steered in their direction kate browning  says parole boards tell released sex offenders where there are landlords that will accept them  and they don't care if there are children in the neighborhood we had a recent incident also here 
[01:59:30]  in mastic where four level three sex offenders were moved into a home there was seven children in the  home next door there was nine children lived directly across of course maybe that's a problem  too her children we can't have them living in communities where there's children but the law now  says you can and that's why lisa kadeska keeps a close eye on her children keep them busy and they 
[02:00:00]  went in this school and i sent them in karate mistake beach football just go too long and keep them busy  mastic that's another town i swear to you they are loading up the low-income towns with pedophiles  then if that's what they did hey whatever god bless they don't find a problem that there's nine  children living in a house across the street extra 16 kids and seven eight that  they're breathing like rabbits out there why don't you just uh move them to the old age community 
[02:00:30]  there you go solution perfect solution uh we got uh genius thank you anthony special uh from fba i believe  that's your name there buddy he uh writes on the answer feedback the best way to avoid them is not  be between the ages of four and 17  wow just an older community and then problem solved problem freak they're moving them into these  neighborhoods where people are having kids out of wedlock of course i bet i bet there were nine 
[02:01:00]  daddies to those nine children also you've been to mastic no no no i used to buy my drugs and wine  what's next wine dance yeah was it nice mastic mastic was nice i have home movies of me my brother  my sister visiting uh the bungalow that my family used to have it was like almost like a timeshare  bungalow and mastic it was wonderful it had a nice little white picket fence around it and all the  aunts and uncles we decide on a weekend and all go there and they'd have like luau's and parties and 
[02:01:30]  built-in pool was in the back and it was a house and and it was like some of the my first memories  because i was really really young and then i decided when i got a car when i first got a car at about  14 15 years old uh that i was going to drive there and and take a look at it bring back some of my  childhood i drove into a town that looked like beirut and i found the the bungalow and the pool was 
[02:02:00]  half full of this murky gook water all sprayed with graffiti the house was abandoned and sprayed  with graffiti and half collapsed and the place just looked like and it was like one of those things  where maybe it's just not a good idea to ever look back you just got to kind of keep in mind what  things were like that's sad it was really sad and all the mastic is like that now they call it uh like  uh they they call themselves uh indians out there by the way they think they're part of some tribe 
[02:02:30]  out there but it's not they are um very low-income black and hispanic people that have just  completely destroyed the neighborhood that's what's out there what's the name of their tribe the jobless  so hack i know i'm sorry i'll like i'll completely acknowledge i'm not bad with that kanya it could  have at least sounded more like an indian name you know well someone said description of mastic you 
[02:03:00]  take the lie to exit 68 and go south when the grass turns brown you're in mastic yeah all right no one  takes care of uh anything out there why don't we take a break um yeah the amish school shooting  that just proves no one's safe huh the amish the hell is happening well they said the guy didn't  target the amish it was just because the school was by where he lived like he was yeah and no no  security in there or animal trying to kill kids and he did it wasn't an omnis 20 or some 20 year old  grudge he had uh just that he was holding and he goes in there and uh decides to shoot a bunch of 
[02:03:30]  little girls and he kisses his own kids goodbye like he gives them a longer hug at the bus stop because  he knows what he's going to do at least he was a good dad all right why don't we get into that a little  bit that's sadness i learned something about the amish they get to be sluts for a year did you know  that what do you mean what i'll explain next it's the ona virus spreading across america  it's the opian anthony show coming october 4th this place is in a quandary and there will be major  changes an announcement that will forever change the future of the opian anthony show oh what are we

[02:05:30]  hacky radio bit but uh we were thinking maybe big a would drink a couple of cocaines for youtube or  something i don't know we'll figure it out where's that big dope but uh not lummux in in a while  the headline reads polls snort at cocaine drink  polls snort at cocaine drink i get it  all right the amish so jimmy what do you what do you know about this i gotta be honest man the 
[02:06:00]  school shootings is i i but this isn't really like a serious no i understand but in school  shootings in general like i try to be up on everything i i do my best i really try but when  i see that crap on tv i'm just like i don't want to be bothered it's just it it's just awful this  animal uh this animal he's married with kids i guess he's like 30 years old whatever he is i don't  family man uh family man are you mr greedy he targeted a school he uh i guess a little school 
[02:06:30]  house where he uh separated the boys and the girls and he had all the girls stay and he got rid of  everybody else and i think they were between the ages of six and thirteen and he just executed them  and he didn't they didn't all die yeah i think some of them died instantly i think summer still  hurt obviously and then he just shot himself like what they said he had a daughter die when she was  born or whatever a few years ago like in lancaster county however many years out i don't know if  they do it that could be maybe he felt that the uh he said there was a 20 year old grudge that 
[02:07:00]  this was based on he's 32 then it couldn't be that his daughter died no probably some rejection  that made him impotent of course tragedy you can't even get mad at it because you can't hurt the  person that did it i mean yeah i know it's just very fun we don't even hurt the people that do this  stuff yeah when they're when they're kept alive you know you don't uh when they kill themselves  you don't it's just one of those things if you were allowed to pull them apart like you did insects 
[02:07:30]  when you were a kid that would you know yeah then maybe you get a little justice out of it and the  amish are like uh some pictures of you know some of the i am amish on the paper and they're just kind  of sitting there with their hats in and you really they didn't look sad or happy or anything they  just look like amish you can't how many expressions can you have with that stupid beard i know they just  really look it's like are they sad or did they just do a barn raising and they're a little tired  you can't tell they're shocked yeah shootings in their community that's a biggie they're like 
[02:08:00]  well-behaved citizens they're just going to be want to be more isolated now well they're well-behaved  but they get to be uh like slots for a year yeah what was that that you were saying uh the amish  don't like to be photographed which is a problem because a lot of everyone knows it steals your soul  a lot of tourists go into these you know neighborhoods to check it out because it's  kind of a freak show and it's a tourist attraction and you got your cameras out but they don't like  to be photographed which uh is a huge problem in uh amish country it's like a lifestyle that is also 
[02:08:30]  a tourist attraction right and and i i think they accept it as that too because they they have little  shops and little things they set up buggy rides so they kind of accept it to to finance themselves  well it's a money maker yeah of course so so it's odd that you know your lifestyle is a  well i want to go on a hayride in lancaster well listen to this obviously they don't smoke or drink  or have premarital sex but when teenagers reach 16 they're allowed to leave the community and enter 
[02:09:00]  the outside world for a year or more before returning they're allowed to do a year in the real  world it's called uh rumspringa something like that german for running around and it's a taste of  forbidden fruit but it was amok time a girl can shed her plain long dress and bonnet nothing and  a boy his suspenders and straw hat for trendy clothes and jeans some even have used their  rumspringa to experiment with drugs sex or alcohol and generally indulge in a lifestyle that would  otherwise not be tolerated and then they have to go back into the community after seeing that for a 
[02:09:30]  year or doing that for a year finding sex with all these people then rumspringa is over and you got  to go back to pushing up barn doors yeah god talks to me in one year courting your women god  talks to me in one year satan and the other one amish girl told him part of me wants to be amish like  my parents but the other part wants the jeans and the haircut so how awful is that one minute you're  like you know you're hanging out with a stripper you're doing lines off her chest next thing you know  you're churning butter with your fat childbearing hips wife how awful yeah they should give you that 
[02:10:00]  in the last years of your life you have something to look forward to yeah why would you show them  what they're missing it's ridiculous thing ever yeah if you didn't know any better you'd probably  settle into the lifestyle but uh for them to push out into the real world where you could see the  other side having fun it doesn't seem like that would be a good thing that's probably so later on  when you really get annoyed with the lifestyle you could say well you know you had a choice 
[02:10:30]  you had a chance back then during the rumspringa right uh and then they get to hold you there they  probably do that they want to they want to keep it like a small community you know how many people  they lose to rumspringa i bet they lose a lot uh hopefully there's some girls here doing heroin  who are prostitutes who are all rumspringa victims or amish used to be the amish yeah let's say  hi to shannon in ohio shannon hey what's going on guys hey hi um you guys are talking about the  rumspringa um rumspringa all right rumspringa yeah um i grew up among amish people my whole childhood so 
[02:11:00]  um you did yes i did um i saw a lot of the rumspringa stuff happening i went to school up to eighth grade  with a lot of amish people and um it's just it's crazy and but the um there's a lot more people who  go back to the amish church than you would think after rumspringa because they make it so i mean  if you if you decide to stick with and being um you know not amish you're basically shunned from 
[02:11:30]  your family that's how they could get you to go back in ah you can't visit for you know holidays or  whatever they have you're pretty much shunned you're banished into uh the real world i guess you  could make up for it by having sex and listening to cds i'd take that off my parents for offense  right sex and tv and cable of my parents nagging annoying christmas dinner yeah oh did you hear  what happened we were churning butter but the old piece of wood fell in yuck what awful i'm sorry 
[02:12:00]  i didn't mean to rip i've got your van heusen sweater son did you dad you're gonna look like  the back end of a mule in this and then what happened oh look some mule turd pie would you like  some mule turd pie with molasses on it i was just eating entenman's donuts and now i come back to  mule turd pie choufly pie is a favor of the amish people mother's making rhubarb is she yeah fantastic 
[02:12:30]  oh look your favorite dessert turnips with whipped cream on them  but after a year i guess you could decide if you want to go back into go back there all right  hey 20 year grudge uh had 20 year grudge change against women i don't know what that really means  but it's the grudge you guys were talking about we got some audio that explains that further  oh not that grudge didn't have enough time to really launch a full-scale assault because 
[02:13:00]  uh we were still trying to hail him when we got word and by the time we got word  and were able to try to relay it to the perimeter he was already shooting police say roberts shot the  girls he held captive at the school some at point-blank range then he shot himself to death  two girls died at the schoolhouse another died later in the arms of a state trooper  eight children remain hospitalized in very critical condition roberts also left his wife a suicide note 
[02:13:30]  described by investigators as rambling police only said that he harbored an undisclosed  20-year grudge and that he wanted to attack young female victims what a loser just what a weak little pig  yeah that's so annoying and and it's exactly what we were saying yesterday like why be so selfish  that is a selfish selfish guy now that but you know with that trooper that that picks up a girl 
[02:14:00]  and she dies right there in his arms like that he's gonna live with that for the rest of his life  all the families everything just a scumbag yeah that that's where you hope there is some kind of you  hell where he could just be taken it by hitler you can't do anything to him so you might as well  just uh you gotta take it out on uh other other guys who hurt kids you know they should be punished  harder sorry i listen congressman you want we gotta stop it right there we'll we'll continue with this  uh subject and other things on our xm show across the street we're gonna walk over to xm go in a minute

[02:30:00]  Check one, two.  Hi.  We're broadcasting.  Hello.  Opian Anthony Show.  XM Satellite Radio.  Now we can say dirty words. 
[02:30:30]  Dirty words.  Yeah, it is steaming in here.  And apparently Steve doesn't like the smell in here.  He just made a little grimace-y face as you sniffed, like a little bear on his hind legs.  I don't smell trout.  I'm angry with this area of the woods in my Jägermeister jacket.  I thought you were told not to wear that by your wife.  What happened?  My wife's not here right now.  Ah. 
[02:31:00]  I can wear what I want.  If you were wearing pants, if you were wearing pants, they're not that pretty skirt, that pleated little Catholic school skirt in your Jägermeister jacket.  Yeah, she hates my wardrobe, all of it.  That's like a racing jacket, but then it's Jägermeister, which kind of isn't really racing because it's alcohol and doesn't go together.  Drinking Jägermeister while racing.  Drinking and driving.  Yes, I'm aware of that.  But it was free.  It was free, which is, yeah, we're not going to get any air conditioning, I don't believe.  I believe it is broken, is what happened again, yet again. 
[02:31:30]  I heard Ron and Fez talking about the broken air conditioning a few days back.  The broken building guy, instead of standing out front looking like a pedophile mopping shit, fucking fixes it.  Or Jim's mic be on would be good, too.  Why would it be on?  There it is.  Now, what were you saying?  I want an apple.  Jimmy just went on a rant about the building and the air conditioning, and no one got to hear it.  Why don't I have a cup in front of me?  What kind of soup you got?  I have a whole thing of New England clammy chowder from the soup man. 
[02:32:00]  And the wonderful soup man, go to soupman.com, and you can check it out.  What does it say?  Right, originalsoupman.com?  Is that it?  I only do the read 8,000 times a day, and once I don't have a piece of paper in front of me, I forget everything.  Isn't that right, John?  What's your name?  Oh, fan.  Why are you touching apples when I need a soupy bowl?  Oh, shit, he yelled at you.  You can give me the entire bag. 
[02:32:30]  Yeah.  He'll whack it.  Well, don't put the apples back in it.  I know, your dirty Lebanese fingers roll up.  Oh, my God, this is a catastrophe.  Is it?  This is a complete catastrophe.  I'm just trying to have some soup.  Those illegal downloading fingers.  I don't want apples and oranges.  What is this?  A big bag of apples and oranges.  What are we, horses?  What the hell is going on here?  I want...  Holy shit.  What the fuck?  Looks like the cupboard of an AIDS patient. 
[02:33:00]  That's all I want.  Just soup dishes and fucking apples and oranges.  And where's the bread?  Bread's over there.  Oh, my God.  Steve is the worst waiter I've ever seen.  Right.  And the worst production guy.  Why is it so hot in here today?  Oh, by the way, while you've been away, we've been talking about how there's no air conditioning  in here.  Oh, my God.  Why would they fix it?  Hey, let's go to Steve in Connecticut.  To Steve in Connecticut.  I am chowder.  Steve.  Hey, guys. 
[02:33:30]  Hey.  I'm here.  I'm here.  I just wanted to call out.  I mean, everybody knows about Anthony's inability to say the word finger.  Finger?  I would have known that Opie just can't say harmonica.  How do you say it?  Opie was her-monica.  Wasn't he saying harmonica?  Harmonica?  Harmonica.  Hey, if that's the worst you got, Opie, you know, you're a millionaire.  Say however you want.  Harmonica.  Was I really saying it that way?  I didn't even catch it.  Can I even say it the right way?  Oh, it doesn't matter.  How do you say it?  Harmonica?  I'm awful.  That's the best way to say it.  Harmonica, I guess. 
[02:34:00]  I know.  That guy was the worst harmonica player.  Oh, I don't know, Ant.  He was very nervous, that guy.  Ever.  He was a nervous Nelly.  Dude, we can't do a show in here.  This is, how hot is it?  I don't know, but I'm having some nice hot soup, too.  I'm having some chicken vegetable.  That always helps when you're hot.  Nothing better than some warm soup on a blazing day here.  How could it be, it's so much hotter in here than it even is outside.  I don't know.  It's going to be 80 degrees in New York today, too.  Is it really?  Yeah.  And I have my late show kids sweatshack. 
[02:34:30]  Bombing.  It's going to be like Indian summer today and tomorrow.  What's that time of year around some parts of this great land of ours where you just don't  know how the fuck to dress in the morning?  Where's the top ten?  Or you bake.  Where's the top ten funeral songs in Britain?  We could do that today.  I'm but a man, people.  I am only a man.  Don't get upset if I don't have this on in two seconds of walking in.  Leave the boss alone.  He's busy.  God.  Look what's in my blackberries. 
[02:35:00]  Where, sweetie?  Look in the corner.  A fuzzy one.  There we go.  A rotted fuzzy one.  Oh, it's over then.  Call it.  Yeah, why would you?  Oh, wait a minute.  Those are blackberries.  Blackberries.  You gave up on that.  You don't even wash them, Opie.  How do you not wash your blackberries?  Wash your fruit.  No, man.  It helps your immune system to eat this stuff without washing it.  No, it doesn't.  There are insecticides on that.  Yep.  And then grubby people have touched it.  Yeah. 
[02:35:30]  Did they?  Did they?  Did they?  Did they?  There we go.  Everything's on.  I must bounce Mr. Anus from the room.  Why?  Because he's got his hand up, like he wants to say something important.  What's wrong, Mr. Anus?  What's wrong, Kenny?  No, I just wondered if anybody wants anything else.  Um.  Um.  Yeah.  Let me think.  I want a haircut.  Can I have a low-fat yogurt?  No, I'm fine.  And how about a shaven man in a suit?  I was a little lazy to have to shave. 
[02:36:00]  That's all right.  That's one day?  That's two.  Ooh.  Kenny's losing his mind.  Is he?  Kenny's going crazy.  Do you see it happening?  Yeah.  He's slipping into insanity.  Yeah.  I kind of see something.  Yeah.  He's unshaven.  He's never unshaven.  What's going on, Kenny?  I was tired.  I was lazy this morning.  I apologize.  Secret.  Hey, agent man.  Secret.  Hey.  Hey, did you see David Hasselhoff is ripping me off now? 
[02:36:30]  No way.  Yeah, they posted on Whackbag.  There's a YouTube video of David Hasselhoff doing Secret Agent Man.  Was he singing it on the hood of the kit car?  No, but he's got chicks around him and guns and the whole James Bond thing.  Your video's much better.  I've seen I'm a Night Rocker.  Yeah.  And it's him singing on the hood of Kit, the black Trans Am that he used to drive. 
[02:37:00]  And he's singing some song and a bunch of Nazis are just praising him.  Yeah.  I got competition.  He's always got one good point.  We're going to pass out in here.  It is very hot.  It's a bit warm.  Oh, my God.  I got to go run an errand.  All right.  Bye, Kenny.  I have to pass for you over here.  Yeah.  Do you know how to get it?  Get some off to get it.  Okay.  Wow.  It's warm in here.  Oh, my God.  I think we've got to strip down to our undershorts. 
[02:37:30]  All of us.  Why not?  Big packages.  You won't strip down to your underpants.  I will in a second.  You got a jockstrap on?  How creepy is the jockstrap?  The jockstrap.  It shows your asshole and it cups your cock gently.  What a lovely outfit that is.  You know, there isn't one spot on a jockstrap that doesn't stink.  Oh, Jesus, Opie.  Put your goddamn pants on.  All right.  Well.  I am not going to sit in this room. 
[02:38:00]  I'm Darren Anthony because he said he would do it.  No, I did not.  I did not.  It feels much better.  You two.  We're doing the rest of the show in our underwear.  You're doing...  Who else?  The show in your underwear.  E-Rock.  You know E-Rock's got like a fucking Speedo or something.  Yeah.  A pair of panties.  A pair of panties.  E-Rock will do it if Opie asks.  We're doing the rest of the show in our underpants.  That's right.  Who's with us?  Sam, please God, let Sam do it. 
[02:38:30]  Who's with us?  Look at that.  Let Sam do it.  Kenny, you in?  I got boxer briefs.  All right.  You might as well strip down.  I got to run my errands first.  You're putting your shoes on though, Jimmy?  Yeah, I have to.  Just I have to piss or something.  I don't want to...  All right.  Got to be sanitary.  It's hot to have a bunch of men in their underpants with their shoes on.  We look like strippers.  Who else is in?  E-Rock?  Don't be homophobic.  We don't care.  We're not going to look at you.  That means you're sporting something really bad. 
[02:39:00]  Anthony, come on.  All the guys are doing it.  God, someone's going to reveal their panties.  If I had, I don't know, maybe boxers.  What do you have on?  Panties.  Let's go walk...  Women's panties.  Let's walk to Starbucks and order coffee.  Bill's like eager to do it.  He comes in just going...  No one asked him.  And he goes, I'll do it.  He just wants to be in his underwear. 
[02:39:30]  What is he wearing?  He's got his plaid boxers on.  Bill's a creepola.  This is a much better work environment.  Wow, he's like sighing in relief.  No, it's...  Look at the armpit stains, man.  It is hot in here.  All right.  I wasn't looking at his armpits, Opie.  I like the fact that Than isn't stripping down to the waist.  Dan's like me.  Who's most likely to have panties on with this crew? 
[02:40:00]  You mean women's?  Kenny.  That's where his errand was, to go buy men's underwear quickly.  You know, not one of you motherfuckers have said, no homo.  We don't need to.  We know it's not gay.  We're just an underpants.  Gotta say it.  Exactly.  Our dicks are all hard, right?  Guys.  MaF54 checking in.  Is your studio hot, Opie?  Opie, yup. 
[02:40:30]  MaF54.  MaF54.  Want to strip to your underwear?  Opie.  LOL.  Aha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  All right.  It's actually cooler.  Yeah.  Feels good on your legs.  Your bare leg hair.  Why did I have to pick New England clam chowder today?  Just eating a warm, white liquid.  Yeah, we're all gonna be in our underwear, and you're gonna have that stuck in your goatee?  fucking a hunk of crab  or whatever the fuck's in that nonsense  the press will show up 
[02:41:00]  alright  when am I doing the show  what  oh I get it alright  Kevin, Georgia what's up  hey boys  when I'm doing the show in the tab list  well it's not really the tab list  when I do the bad list  it's so much different than  when I'm doing the show in the tab list  this is the exotic  alright  should we take a break  I think so  cause I'm just gonna finish my soup  and then we gotta get to that funeral song 
[02:41:30]  yeah the top ten funeral songs  we got plenty to do  in Britain  Britain  Britain  yeah the heat  the soup  and the homosexuality  is really throwing a damper in  so I think we need to break  regroup  and come back just gay  why is it homo  if you're just sitting around in your underpants  yeah what's wrong with that  bunch of men  fucking shit around  now Jimmy's pulling him up  into the butt 
[02:42:00]  he's pulling him up  into his butt crack  and leaving  his ball back  oh and a bunch of men  in a big sack  in the front  holy shit  you are just the worst  alright  now getting your nails done  could wind up doing a lot of damage  how bad will the hurricanes be  popular medicine for children  now linked to seven deaths  common medicine could be turning people into compulsive gamblers  and is there a hidden danger in your bag of microwave popcorn 
[02:42:30]  are your local reporters trying to scare you to death  the Opie and Anthony show wants to hear scary news teases from your town  send your audio to danny at foundrymusic.com  that's danny at foundrymusic.com  wow what could be the announcement  wonder what that's all about 
[02:43:00]  maybe they're finally building our studio  maybe  maybe they're finally building this place outwards  remember  we gave up on that  months ago  totally  no reason for it  XM won that battle  by the way the air conditioning company is kind of  as Steve said not being cooperative  so maybe somebody out there knows them  or works for them  they're called Nelson Air  and they're in the 718 area code 
[02:43:30]  which is I guess Brooklyn or Queens  so if anybody knows  someone who works for Nelson Air  maybe you can help get to the bottom of it  alright  hey this couple had some problems  and the man  that'll do it  lit his ex on fire  god damn  three days we've been trying to get this fucker in  three  try a week  hmm  where's she going  is she dead or does she just have that perpetually surprised look  she's dead  nah did she uh  she  she made it  she pulled  I don't know  we'll find out 
[02:44:00]  Chris from Canada  no I don't have a lacrosse game today  are you IMing people  I'm IMing  they're IMing me  Marla the reason these two women and this dog  are both alive  and unhurt today  is because they fought back  and also because their attacker's lighter  didn't work  using a lighter and two cans of gasoline  is how William Sheridan allegedly tried to settle an argument with his ex-girlfriend 
[02:44:30]  and her friend inside his Bithwell home last night  I think it was the um  the oldest awesome motive there is  it's love and infatuation  the ex-girlfriend declined to speak on camera but said she had dated Sheridan for six years and that towards the end of their relationship things had gone quote rough  arson investigators say Sheridan showed up to where she was staying with her friend began an argument and tried to force his way in and when that failed he attempted to set the women on fire  what tipped him off not to let him in the fact that he was on the porch arguing with a gas can in each hand 
[02:45:00]  smooth move fella  he's knocking with his forehead because he's got a gas can in each hand  with a lighter in his teeth  I want you back  can you hear the glug glug glug  the glug glug glug of liquid in the fucking metal cans  what's that smell  alright  this gentleman  picked up a gas can  and splashed some of the liquid  onto the roommate 
[02:45:30]  and also her dog  gasoline went flying all over the furniture inside  onto the women  and this cocker spaniel named rossi the dog's collar  it was a bandana  was soaked with gasoline  the women tried to call 911 but that's when investigators say Sheridan grabbed the phone and broke it  then he reached for his lighter but it wouldn't work  he's battering her, he's pushing, he's shoving, he's trying to flick the lighter on  they're apparently in a hand-to-hand struggle for their life basically 
[02:46:00]  after they successfully fought him off Sheridan apparently then tried to steal  but he got stuck in the ditch instead  and according to investigators  he then took off  but was later arrested by orange county sheriff deputies  and today Sheridan was given a fifty thousand dollar bond  and if he gets out of jail he will most likely be monitored with an ankle monitor  how about this  no bail when you try to set people on fucking fire 
[02:46:30]  how come this guy has a bail set?  you're trying to burn someone alive  and there's bail set  fucking ankle bracelet  no bail you goose  and then you get like no bail on some cases where you know  some guy's trying to sell some weed or something  down there in Texas  you should be able to make them wear like a shock collar  and you got the remote control  oh the woman's got it?  yeah that'd be fun  that's probably a good thing they should do  you have them with a taser 
[02:47:00]  like a taser ankle bracelet  and whoever has the restraining order  has the taser  so if they get within a certain distance of that person  you could shock them  or maybe it's automatic  what a great idea  that like  because it's always you know  you can't get within 50 feet or 50 yards of somebody  and when they do  there's nothing the women can do about it  they're fucking helpless  usually wind up getting killed  just have a taser  around his ankle  never worked because 
[02:47:30]  what if something else set it off  like a garage door open  that they didn't know  I mean that's some of the fun  that could just be had with the whole idea  that's the goof factor  Kevin from Connecticut  people back out of the garage  and he's going  down the street  shaking  actually I want to read  Ron sorry Kevin  Ron from New Jersey  hey he only did it because  Dr. Phil told him  he needed to heat up his relationship  ah that old gag  and then DJ Anal Lightbulb  from posthores.net  DJ Anal Lightbulb?  wow 
[02:48:00]  yes  the oldest arson motive there is  is love and infatuation  what the fuck  I thought it was insurance money  yeah I don't know what the hell  that guy was talking about  the oldest motivation for arson  is love  no it's not  murder maybe  or  what an asshole that reporter was  infatuation  that's the oldest motivation  for buying chocolates  and flowers  right  love  gas can and lighter  no  arson  they call it uh  Jewish lightning  oh my god  I was just 
[02:48:30]  I was distracted  because I'm looking at  the top 10 British funeral songs  yeah  I've had  I had to  go to a few funerals  in the last couple years  it blows  and uh  pulling at the heart strings  with uh  music just  never good  knock it off  people are sad enough  why make them sadder  why make them sadder  life  with some  sad music  I went to college  with a kid named uh  Stu  he was my brother's roommate  and he was driving home 
[02:49:00]  from Geneseo  with his girlfriend  this doesn't end well  and he uh  allegedly was  doing something  he shouldn't be doing  with uh  some illegal substances  substances  uh huh  driving him maybe under the influence  and it was on like 17 or something  coming home from Geneseo  head on  head on collision  dead  eek  so when we got back to college  uh they had a memorial  they had a memorial  and  they thought  that uh  they should play  boogie with stew

[03:09:30]  it's like a way and we we should attempt to have some kind of closure  and somehow uh find like a reason for things  i don't know i think it's somehow a control thing  does it help though i guess in some cases it does  no we're goofing trust me we know that but someone call up and tell me  oh fuck marv  if it helps  does it really help  no people think that you need all that sorrow  and all it does is like remain with you  don't you want to remember somebody like uh how they were  yeah but not like through through like oh let me think back at that person
