FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  April Fool's Day hosts fall flat at Boston City Hall.  A radio station reported the mayor had died in an accident.  The station's afternoon DJs repeatedly told listeners  the mayor had been killed in a car accident in Florida.  That car is real trauma within my family.  They never apologized. Totally irresponsible.  Can anyone take a joke anymore?  Boston Mayor Tom Menino thankfully is alive and well.  Contrary to a radio station's so-called April Fool's Joke. 
[00:00:30]  WAAF DJs Opie and Anthony had announced on the air  the mayor was killed in a car accident.  Oh yeah!  This is Opie and Anthony.  Hey, this is Opie and Anthony  on the new WBCN Boston.  WBCN Boston.  Opie and Anthony.  The new WBCN Boston.  The father complained to the FBC and he may even sue the radio station.  This is Opie and Anthony on the new WBCN Boston. 
[00:01:00]  WBCN Boston.  The mayor's family is fans of the Opie and Anthony show.  Tom Menino was very upset.  Adding to his anger was the fact that the on-air personalities never apologize.  We apologize to the mayor.  Never apologize.  I am sorry, mayor.  I will not accept the apology of this time.  I am sorry, mayor.  Opie and Anthony killed Menino.  Opie and Anthony killed Menino.  This is going to get you fired. 
[00:01:30]  I am sorry, mayor.  You make me sick, you fat sack of crap.  The station initially tried to parlay this incident into a publicity stunt.  Station owners did take the situation very seriously and today they acted.  Opie and Anthony repeatedly announced that Mayor Tom Menino had been killed in a car crash.  Now WAAF has suspended the DJs indefinitely without pay.  Mayor Menino is also seeking sanctions from the Federal Communications Commission.  Let's kick it.  Today, Opie and Anthony were gone. 
[00:02:00]  Fired.  Fired.  Opie and Anthony are on employee tonight.  Opie and Anthony have been terminated.  Fired.  And that looks like the last you're going to hear from either of these DJs for a while.  And if the former WAAF Afternoon Drive duo are looking for sympathy, they better not look on the streets of Boston.  I agree with it.  I think they should have been fired.  Absolutely.  I think they should have been fired.  It's like someone saying that my mama says.  Opie and Anthony are off the air for good.  Losers.  Opie and Anthony have been fired.  It was all just a joke. 
[00:02:30]  Opie and Anthony delivered the joke on April Fool's Day.  But the punchline knocked them right out of Boston radio.  They're dead air as far as their radio show is concerned.  That's no joke.  The station's keeping kind of a low profile as a couple of its top DJs go to no profile.  ...jokes.  Opie and Anthony are going to be delivering audition tapes.  Mayor Menino had a comment on that tonight.  But in the season, he said, hopefully this incident will give all broadcasters off.  High.  High.  The big statements which are false and irresponsible. 
[00:03:00]  Piss off.  Opie and Anthony tell the Menino.  We told the mayor of Boston.  Don't ask them.  Opie and Anthony.  We're nobody's bitch.  Oh, I knew that would happen.  Great.  What's the matter, Kirk?  You don't know how the controls of the constellations...  There it is.  How that spectacular intro and then we don't get our music played, Anthony. 
[00:03:30]  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  How's that, okay?  Screw the music.  That works.  All right.  A couple phone numbers in the New York area as we figure out the buttons here in Boston.  1-877-692-1027.  Anywhere else, including, of course, Boston today, Anthony.  866-277-4.  Wow.  What's wrong?  I'm just still recouping from our lunch. 
[00:04:00]  That was a fun lunch.  Yeah.  We did something similar in Philly when we went there recently.  We met with people.  Right.  Met with a lot of people.  A lot of the sales staff here at BCN and a lot of clients.  Opie.  What's wrong, Norton?  There's a lot of the people that will be supporting this very program.  Right.  And we enjoy that.  We like new sponsors coming on board with the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:04:30]  As long as you don't have to meet the people.  But we do absolutely love the products.  As long as the people stay away.  So we went to a lovely place on Boylston Street here in Boston.  Right, Ben?  What was the name of that place?  Aben-Louis.  Aben-Louis?  Yeah.  Aben-Louis, yeah.  Aben-Louis.  Okay.  And we stood there and we had people brought by us.  Right.  To take pictures with us and tell us who they're from.  What, you know, beer company or record store or something they're from. 
[00:05:00]  And talk with them briefly.  And Norton had me.  I'm exhausted from laughing too hard.  This guy has no pride, no conscience, nothing.  Norton helped us through it, Anthony.  Everyone's shaking hands.  Right.  That's what you do.  You walk in there, you just start grabbing and shaking hands.  Hi, pleased to meet you.  Well, yeah, we walk in and everyone's excited to meet us and stuff.  And like you said, there's a guy with a camera so we can get some photo ops and take pictures 
[00:05:30]  with all the big clients up here in Boston.  And there's Jim.  He didn't shower.  He didn't shave.  He smelled.  He hasn't slept in two days.  He's wearing some army t-shirt.  Right.  And we would introduce him because people would come up, hey, Opie, Anthony, and then, oh,  and this is Jim.  So after a while, Jim goes, hey, I'm giving everyone the dead fish.  He's like, what?  You're the handshake. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah.  It's the dead fish.  You could do this.  Just take your hand and let it go limp and now let somebody shake it.  Even worse, though, dude, he was making sure it was all wet and clammy.  Well, that's another thing.  He was dipping it in his drink.  So his hand is now cold, wet, and limp.  And he would shake people's hands.  And we'd watch them in horror.  They would try to wipe their hand on their pants, very nonchalant.  Huge clients.  Put it in their pocket.  Huge clients.  You've got to tell the folks.  You know, Newberry Comics up here in Boston, Budweiser, and Twitter, and Guinness. 
[00:06:30]  And they're meeting us for the first time.  And they're going to spend a lot of money up here at WBCN.  And they met us and were like, well, and here's Jim.  He's kind of a social misfit, but he's trying the best he can.  And I just got to tell all the clients that are listening to us, because you know they're  all listening, because we just did lunch together.  You guys were all had by Mr. Norton.  You should have said something.  None of you guys had the balls to say, hey, man, what's up with the crappy handshake?  Not even that.  They wouldn't wipe their hands off in front of the guy. 
[00:07:00]  Your hand was soaked and cold, just wet and limp.  And they would shake and then do that hand on the hip thing.  Where it's like, all right, maybe he's not noticing I'm sopping up his sweat or hiv or  whatever's on his hands.  Or they'd put their hand in the pocket.  Some of them would even go so far as to run it through their hair.  I don't want to upset the guy.  I actually did it to the GM here.  I didn't realize.  Yeah, Tony. 
[00:07:30]  Tony thought it was the dude from Night Court.  You thought it was Richard Malt from Night Court.  So then Ant and I are watching this whole thing go on, and we're trying not to crack up,  because all you guys were so polite.  You took Jim Norton's handshake, and you made believe it wasn't clammy and limp and disgusting.  Then in front of some of the hot girls, he was being the retarded Jim.  Right.  Where he just makes like a face.  He ducks his head down real low, goes in head first, and sticks his hand straight out. 
[00:08:00]  Hi, I'm pleased to meet you.  Hi, I'm pleased to meet you.  And they look at him like, okay, are you having fun?  Like he's genuinely retarded.  They're so afraid of offending you two.  And that's the beauty of it.  Maybe that was it.  They just know that you like me for some reason, and they have to be nice to me.  And they didn't want to like offend.  No.  And then they were troopers.  That coupled with just the normal Norton shenanigans, if I might use the word, Jim, shenanigans.  Yeah, dropping gassers. 
[00:08:30]  He will just say, hey, you dropped something.  You know that old gag.  And then there's another one.  We were sitting around a table, and we were talking to some guy, and he goes, okay, nice to meet you guys.  Take it easy.  The guy turns to walk away, and Jim just yells, uh, wait.  But he's not looking at the guy.  He just yells, uh, wait, and looks at his shoes.  And the guy turns around and stops.  And now he's standing there waiting for somebody to say something to him, because you made him stop.  And wait.  Then it's so uncomfortable, because then he's got to say, oh, I guess they weren't talking to me. 
[00:09:00]  They weren't talking to me, and they move on.  I've got to just make sure I look cool just trying to get out of this situation and walk away.  You're embarrassing.  It was hilarious.  And he got us through the client lunch, and I appreciate that, Mr. Norton.  Actually, you know, there's some lovely people up here in Boston.  We're standing out on the sidewalk in front of the place, and crowds of people walking by very slowly.  Nice day in Boston.  He had given up all his secrets.  Oh, please.  There were plenty of rubes.  I doubt they were listeners anyway.  They were in their 50s.  Yeah. 
[00:09:30]  It was like some people walking very slowly, shuffling down the sidewalk.  And Jim will get on the other side of the sidewalk from me, the people walking between us,  and then just shout things while they're in the middle, like, you know, I tested positive,  but I'm not telling her.  Like, that's the only piece of the conversation they catch, and they look like they're hard  to fuck.  It's so uncomfortable to watch.  And he plays the gay guy thing.  Yeah.  Where will be the gay guy?  Sweetie Cakes, do you need some sugar for your coffee?  Yeah, yeah.  Sweetie Love.  It's always great when a guy's walking by and you say to your friend, so what?  I'm just going to suck it.  I don't care what he says. 
[00:10:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And that's all they hear as they walk by.  A little piece of conversation.  Thank you, Jim.  You did get us through that.  I actually got to give credit where it's due.  Me and Club Soda Kenny, I came up with it together.  The day JFK Jr. went missing, we were walking around the Atlantic City, Hilton, and as the  elevator doors were closed, we'd say, I can't believe they found him alive in the ocean.  And you don't know how many people, what, they found him alive?  They're like, no, what are you talking about?  As the door shuts in their face.  Nosey, mind your business.  All right, so we're figuring it out. 
[00:10:30]  It's a little awkward.  Yeah.  Someone's saying, we sound like we're broadcasting from a bathroom.  Really?  Yeah.  How could that be?  That shouldn't be.  How could we have a sound problem here?  Wait a minute.  We don't have a dump.  Oh.  We got to dump it down in New York.  The old Big Apple.  You see?  We have no control up here, Jim.  I can't just dump out of your crap.  Yeah.  Can we go to Frank on line one and see what he's, you know, he's talking about here? 
[00:11:00]  Let's see if the phones will work.  Oh, you got to do it that way?  Yeah.  Frank on line one.  Frank on line one.  That ain't going to work.  That means plunk him down in New York.  There we go.  Hey, Frank, what's going on?  What's up, fellas?  What I said was, it sounded like you were broadcasting from I Want to Go Home's bathroom.  What do you mean?  I still don't get it.  All right, I'm out.  Hit an ejection handle.  All right.  Punch out, Maverick. 
[00:11:30]  No, it's always weird when we go to, you know, another city, because you got to, like, figure  out where all the buttons are in the studio.  Yeah, it sounds like we're in an echo chamber or something.  We screwed up the whole start of the show.  We have so many people checking us out, looking through these windows.  That's not too uncomfortable.  And then we're playing the big, huge, you know, Opie and Anthony are back to Boston sweeper,  and then you're supposed to slam right into that Rage Against the Machine music, and then  we're on.  We didn't know how to start the CD player, man.  Nothing.  We stink. 
[00:12:00]  Not used to us, CD players.  All right, but here we are.  Yes, we're live in Boston at WBCN.  This place is just filled with history.  I love coming here.  We broadcasted from here a few times now, Anthony.  Yeah.  It's like a real station, not like the one we're in in New York.  Right.  Which is like a stop-off for the suits, the CBS suits.  We walked around the studios today and go, wow, you mean people, rock artists actually  stop by and hang with you guys?  Yeah.  They got pictures and gold records on the wall that haven't been pilfered by some of the 
[00:12:30]  staff like they were at our station in New York.  Yeah.  So it's kind of neat, kind of being around.  I was hoping to see the Oedipus' secret room that everyone talks about.  We're going to find the secret room while we're broadcasting live here in Boston the  next couple days.  I'm thinking it's behind the bookcase in his office, and it's stacked up with all the  stolen CDs that he will sell.  Well, the secret room is legendary here at WBCN.  Of course it is.  That's all we know, and we've got to find it.  That is our goal.  That's all the drugs are, too.  Before we go back to New York, so. 
[00:13:00]  Absolutely.  Yeah, Oedipus has a picture of him and Courtney Love just hanging out on a couch in his office.  I mean, the place is so freaking cool.  Legendary.  And they put us up, of course, in one of our favorite hotels here in Boston.  Well, I'm not going to say which one.  I would just say it is the one that we were fired in.  Yeah.  Yeah, we get the joke, Oedipus.  Stop.  Can you book us in another hotel, please?  Yeah, after we said.  I mean, the cute cheese plate and the fruit is nice and all, but, you know, it doesn't.  We're still reminded that this is the place we got fired from when we used to work in Boston. 
[00:13:30]  And the little rubber ducky in the shower.  Did you get that yet?  Yeah, I got to give you a little rubber ducky.  But it's the same hotel, yeah.  When we said the mayor, Mayor Menino here up in Boston was dead and got fired, they took us  to the conference room of this hotel with the 50-foot conference table.  Yeah, huge conference table with a suit from the company and a lawyer from the company.  And then it says, we're going to have to terminate.  You got to terminate.  We're going to have to get a picture from that conference room. 
[00:14:00]  Yeah.  So we can put it up on the website.  We haven't been in that conference room since.  I'd like to just sit down and maybe drink a couple of beers right at that conference  on the table.  Right there.  Nice.  That's it.  A little celebration because who the hell would think after about three years?  Steve from foundrymusic.com made the trip to Boston.  He's getting lots of pictures done.  You got to get a picture of the conference room before you leave Boston in the next couple  of days, Steve.  Absolutely.  So we can put that on the website.  And then we walked by Daisy Buchanan's on Newberry Street, the place we went and got hammered  after we got fired. 
[00:14:30]  Yeah, yeah.  All the memories coming back.  Oh, yeah.  All the pleasant memories.  Of our being let go and not knowing where we were going to end up.  And then ending up down in New York.  And now, look at us.  We're back.  It's kind of like a homecoming.  It is.  Did a little article for the Boston Globe.  Yeah.  Did that today.  Thanks for asking the exact same questions we've been asked for the last year and a half.  Same questions.  He looks at me because I rolled my eyes.  He's like, what's wrong?  I'm like, oh, oh, oh, no.  A little tired.  A little tired.  I'm just still waking up. 
[00:15:00]  I need my coffee.  What else are you going to ask?  How did you two team up?  Well, thank God he didn't ask that one.  Shut your face.  No, they finally moved on from that question, Jeff.  But most of the other ones are the same.  But like, you know, I was saying, what the hell are they going to ask?  How do you cure the AIDS?  Not basically.  They're like, well, you two are pretty stupid guys.  Yeah.  They, it's a, it's a, it's an invitation to insult us at the end of the years.  We understand the type of show we put on.  Sure.  You guys do an awfully dumb radio show and you seem like stupid guys on the air. 
[00:15:30]  Are you stupid in real life?  Uh, what?  Uh, yeah.  Yeah.  That's what they, he asked us.  He said, you're kind of stupid on the air.  It's like, gee, thanks.  And then we have to defend our intelligence and say how intelligent we are and, I'm smart.  I'm smart.  So that's going to be in the Boston Globe in a few Sundays, I think.  Yeah.  Sunday pullout, Anthony.  We made the Sunday pullout.  The pullout.  Great.  Is that the one where they try to put the color on the magazine and if they're off by  a fraction of an inch, you look like a mongoloid? 
[00:16:00]  You ever see that sometimes in the TV guy?  They, they kind of get the red off center from the blues and the yellows on the picture  and you look like you're, you're doing that flip your eyes up, your eyelids up.  The only thing that was weird about today, if I could go back to the luncheon or, you  know, meet the cadavers as it should be called.  Oh, God.  Uh, was, it was just so weird because in Philly, you know, there was the wow balloons and it  was festive and we were sitting on chairs like 14 year olds with no tables with awful  food and this was like a real place. 
[00:16:30]  Yeah, it was a real place.  They hooked us up.  But then, then you had to deal with, you know, people in suits and, you know,  smart pants.  You know, my favorite thing that you guys still is.  Smashing your teeth, hopefully.  Tim, these guys are going to spend a lot of money on our radio show in Boston.  We really, you have a lot to learn, man.  That really isn't our, our whole scene.  That isn't it.  I think the interview guy was right.  We are stupid.  We don't like, uh, I don't like sitting in, in that atmosphere. 
[00:17:00]  It's too stuffy for me.  Right.  I had it down to Guinness just to deal with the situation.  All right.  And then the Guinness guy came up.  They introduced me to the Guinness guy.  He was like my hero.  Like, oh, I love your beer.  He's brewing it at his house.  Every product that they introduced us to us, we're like, oh, we have some of your product  in our office back home in New York.  I love that.  I mean, it is the truth, but what else are we going to say?  Anal wart cream.  Love it.  Love it.  Looking forward to you supporting the program.  We support anal wart cream. 
[00:17:30]  I got one.  I got to be honest, too.  That food was so good, and I shoved cheesecake into my dumb face.  I'm not exaggerating.  Two more steps, and I would have sprayed mud in my box.  I was so close to not making it back to the hotel.  Honestly, I was halfway up between the Prudential building.  Do you ever do the straight leg chaplain walk?  Yeah.  Oh, it was brutal.  Get back to the room.  You thank God.  There's no one in the room with you.  Oh, it's like the jacket goes on the floor, and the pants and boxers in one swooping motion. 
[00:18:00]  What do you do?  You've been in a relationship for a while.  Yeah.  What do you do in the hotel room where the walls, now the doors at this hotel, the bathroom  doors are, they're closet doors.  They're, yeah.  They are like the French doors.  Yeah, they got little shutters on them.  Little shutters.  There is no sound muffling coming from the bathrooms.  What do you do?  Do you let it all hang out?  Do you go for broke, not caring what kind of audible sounds are coming from the bathroom? 
[00:18:30]  Or do you try to leave somewhat, do you try to leave your girls something to grab onto  to still love you by?  You know what I mean?  You know, it's funny you say that, because we look at farts very differently.  I guess we are stupid, because now we're going to talk about farts.  See, we got, but it's a whole thing with a relationship.  You're in a hotel room where the doors to the bathroom are like paper, and now if you've  got to go, do you wait until you're alone?  Do you, Ant?  See, you're on a jackhammer.  I've known you for a long time.  Anthony refuses to fart in front of anyone. 
[00:19:00]  Anyone.  Girlfriend, guys, whatever the case.  I don't like that.  I don't.  Put me silly there.  I just let it fly.  Before I drove up here last night, I was at the Islander game.  Islander's won again, by the way.  Yeah.  And I'm sitting with Joey and his lovely wife, Joey Paisano, of course, and Sandy's there.  And I'm just letting them loose in the luxury boxes.  Right in front of everybody.  And Sandy gets pissed off.  So you do it right in front of Sandy. 
[00:19:30]  If I know they're not going to, you know, have that aroma.  Right.  How do you know?  You just know.  And if you're in the bathroom.  You've got to figure out what you've eaten lately.  I'm talking about you have to go.  You go into the bathroom.  Your girl is in the room.  It's a small room.  Once that door opens up, all bets are off.  I have to go because I'll get my, I'll get a tummy ache if I don't relieve my bowels.  You're tum-tum-tum-tum.  Right.  All right.  See, now I'm from the school of I will wait. 
[00:20:00]  So you probably have an achy stomach here because you haven't done your deed today.  No, no.  Or if a push comes to shove and, well, and I have to, I will run everything, the radio,  the sink, the shower.  I will flush so the toilet never fills back up.  Sounds like a who show coming from the bathroom.  Like deep purple 1974 volume coming out of there because I, I don't know, I feel funny coming 
[00:20:30]  out and it just, it's not me.  Ah, you're in a newer relationship.  Give it a few more years.  Is that what it is?  Yeah, because then you have to give up.  No, hey.  Your stomach's aching and you just, you just got to move on.  Man, I don't know.  Nine years in, uh.  Can't wait to see your costume tonight, Anthony.  Oh, hey, there we go.  Don't ruin the surprise.  I'm not going to ruin it for you.  All right.  I'm dressing up.  Now, I figured out what you're wearing.  You did?  Oh, yeah.  All right.  You'll have to wait until we hit the stage.  Yeah, right after the radio show, we're going to be hanging with the Crystal Methods, big  Halloween party tonight here in Boston. 
[00:21:00]  What are you going at?  We're going to be emceeing and judging the costumes.  I will not have a costume on tonight.  You will not wear a costume?  Is your girlfriend wearing a costume?  Sandy will be wearing a costume, yes.  Jim Norton will.  He doesn't wear a costume.  Jim Norton, do you wear a costume?  Yeah, I'm dressing up as a guy who would like to receive oral treats.  Okay.  The usual.  Ben, anything?  Did you bring your Afro wig, Ben?  I changed my costume on Saturday. 
[00:21:30]  I was a priest.  I got a priest out there.  You were pitching Friday that you wouldn't wear a costume?  I was, but I wasn't allowed to go to the party if I didn't have the costume.  Did you bring it for tonight?  No.  Of course not.  And Steve C., you're part of our troop there.  No costume.  I actually bought a new pair of shoes.  That's about as far as I'm going.  What about Earl?  Anyone?  Earl?  You're the only one wearing it.  I'm going to be the only guy dressing up for this.  What about Rick?  Did he wear as the crow guy outfit?  Rick is not wearing a costume either, Anthony. 
[00:22:00]  Earl?  I'm going as a spook.  Oh, Jesus, Earl.  Earl.  Come on, man.  Wow.  Exactly.  Nick's sitting there.  You don't want to hear that crap.  Jesus.  No, I'm not wearing a costume.  You're not?  No.  All right, we should take a break and figure out what the F we're going to do.  I think we finally figured out how all the buttons work.  We got how everything works?  Yeah.  This is professional radio at its best.  I remember an episode of Star Trek where Kirk transported over to another ship, and he 
[00:22:30]  went to the auxiliary bridge, and he still knew how to fly the goddamn thing.  Well, nothing's labeled here.  What's wrong with you?  I don't know.  All right.  Remind me when we get back to tell you that great dump story I have from famous for the  stripper, because it's a gem.  Can't wait, man.  All right, so here's the deal.  We're broadcasting live from Boston, the WBCN studios.  We're encouraging listeners to stop by today, aren't we, Anthony?  Sure.  We have WOW WBCN Opie and Anthony t-shirts to give away, the bumper stickers, the WOW bumper  stickers that everyone wants. 
[00:23:00]  So just stop by.  We got like 250 shirts, okay?  Stop by and say hi.  Also, more importantly, Boob-O-Lantern girls.  Wouldn't it be great if some of the strippers that we used to cohort with up here would  come down to be in the Boob-O-Lantern thing?  I can only imagine what they're looking like these days.  Three hard years.  Three hard years.  That's like a rental car.  That's dog years.  Three years for a rental car.  That's pretty rough.  It's going to be dinged up a little bit.  All the old strippers that we used to know and love, stay away. 
[00:23:30]  I like to keep my fantasy where it's at right now.  All right, so the Boob-O-Lantern thing's happening.  It's 1265 Boylston Street in Boston.  Ladies with the breast implants, you come on by.  We got these flashlights that will light up your boobs.  It's amazing.  Yeah.  New York let us down, quite frankly.  We have to say it.  What?  We got a few.  New York let us down.  Boston is going to show us how it's done the next couple days, Anthony.  We got five girls in New York. 
[00:24:00]  Kiss a little more, ass Opie.  What?  Kiss a little more, ass Opie.  I think people are going to agree with us, though.  All right.  Well, I...  You go to opieandanthony.com to check out the contestants for the Boob-O-Lantern contest.  Yeah.  There's five girls up there.  Until we get six here, I am...  I have all the confidence in the world that Boston is going to come through for this contest, Anthony.  Prove me wrong.  We got three fine prizes.  We got a pair of tickets to the Aerosmith in either Philly, Boston, New York, or...  That's it, right?  Okay.  Then we got a Samsung DVD player. 
[00:24:30]  And then we got $1,000 cash.  So, ladies, if you're listening and you're close to 1265 Boylston Street and you have the breast implants,  come on by so we can take your pictures and put you up with the rest of the contestants, okay?  Great.  All right.  We're going to take a quick break, and we'll be back from Boston.  A couple phone numbers in the New York area, 877-692-1027.  Anywhere else, including Boston, 866-277-4WOW.  We've got lots to do, so hang tight and we'll be back.  Nothing you've imagined has prepared you for this. 
[00:25:00]  Hey.  Oh, come in here.  I'm gay.  I just barked mouth.  He said sit on it, so I did.  Toby and Anthony.  Ah, Anthony Diamond Vision and Dr. Philotoff.  Yeah, you had this done like two years ago.  You were scared out of your bird.  When we used to broadcast in Boston, I'll be a little local here.  All right. 
[00:25:30]  I was blind as a bat.  Now I'm seeing 2015.  Very good.  And I was very, very scared, Anthony.  You were.  And you went with glasses for much too long because you let your fear get in the way.  Since I was eight years old, and now I don't need glasses, I was at the Islander game.  It was unbelievable.  I mean, I could pick up the puck, and it's just incredible.  It really is.  I play sports.  I'm playing better because I can see better, and I am so happy I got this done.  Dr. Philotoff is the man.  And he has a new office in New Jersey, I believe, Ann.  Very handy.  Yes, call Diamond Vision now at 1-800-984-2020. 
[00:26:00]  That's 1-800-984-2020.  And take advantage of their special introductory price of LASIK starting at only $4.99 per eye.  Some restrictions apply.  Also find out about that new office in Jersey.  Give them a call.  It's Diamond Vision and Dr. Philotoff.  1-800-984-2020.  1-800-984-2020.  1027 WNEW.  And we're back with the O.P. and Anthony Show, broadcasting live from Boston, from the WBCN studio, Godsmack. 
[00:26:30]  We're going to be doing a project with Godsmack, Anthony.  All we're associated with the same project as Godsmack.  Really?  Yes, we'll have details, especially for the Boston area.  Hey, I thought they were our band.  Hey, Dave, what are we going to do?  And there's nothing our old station can do about it. 
[00:27:00]  Food, thank you, Dave.  He knows what makes me happy.  You know, we forgot to mention something.  Yeah.  They're treating us like kings here in Boston.  We've got lots of beer on ice behind us.  Where's that?  You didn't see the beer?  Crack one open.  A whole tub of Budweiser, Anthony.  Let's really push their patience and get me drinking.  They treated us to lunch with the clients.  We went over that already.  And now we've got to mention the foosball table.  They had it imported. 
[00:27:30]  Yeah.  For the next couple of days.  We want to thank Chachi for going out and getting us a foosball table.  They know between the times we're on the air and we're on breaks, a lot of times we play some foosball.  Right.  And they wanted to make us comfortable.  How long is this going to last, though?  I don't know.  When are they going to catch on?  I don't know.  All I know is Boston treating us much better than Philadelphia did.  Oh!  Are you listening, Tim Sabian?  Are you pitting them against each other? 
[00:28:00]  Oh, yeah.  Tim and Edipus?  Because I think we're going to be broadcasting from Philly in the very near future.  And we expect a foosball table and some type of video game.  What is this plan I'm hearing that you're concocting?  It's just, I don't know.  We're going to be broadcasting in Washington.  I hear, yeah, we're going to be broadcasting in Washington.  Next Monday.  And then instead of just coming right home.  Right.  We stop in Philly.  Well, to stop on the train line.  Are we going to be on?  The cities we're in are turning into like the friend's house that you could just knock on the door at two in the morning. 
[00:28:30]  Hey, man, could I crash here?  Have you spoken to anybody in Philly about this?  Like they're going to say no?  I know.  We're going to show up Tuesday morning in Philly.  We're going to be tired.  Road travelers.  Yes.  And weary travelers.  We're going to ask him to take us in for the day so we can broadcast our show from Philly on Tuesday.  I'm sure he'll be thrilled.  And just to see Tim's ass in those slacks again will be worth the stomp over right there.  Hopefully he won't wear underpants. 
[00:29:00]  I'm starting to think anything we say, he'll do it.  So stop.  Right.  Don't even start.  Another thing, Anthony.  Yeah.  Oedipus dresses much nicer than Tim Sabian.  Yeah.  Oedipus isn't walking around with slacks here in Boston.  No.  No.  Very professional.  Very professional.  Mm-hmm.  And of course, Tony here dressed in a suit, which I wasn't used to seeing.  Right.  The GM up here has earrings and stuff.  Yeah.  Much cooler.  But now he's in a suit.  And our own Ken Stevens. 
[00:29:30]  Oop.  I don't think Ken is a real GM.  I don't know what he does.  He never seems to be at one place too long.  Like these guys, they're here.  Right.  This is their job.  Right.  Ken and Jeremy, they're like vagabonds.  They're all over.  Are they in Philly?  Are they in D.C. this week?  New York?  Shut up.  You're going to ruin it.  You can't keep track of them?  Like you want bosses around?  No.  Thank God.  They might realize what we do.  Nick Carter's in the studio, Anthony.  Yes. 
[00:30:00]  Nick.  He's completely horrified.  But here's Nick.  I want this.  This crap is taking my slot.  Just for all the other cities, Nick is on WBCN right before us.  Yeah.  And I just want to get his observations of this whole thing that's called the Opie and Anthony  show that's just kind of strolled into the studio.  Well, you know, first of all, it's an adversary of WBCN.  I just want to say don't be fooled.  It's not so much they love you so much.  All right?  The foosball table.  Yeah.  They just don't want to get bitch slapped because they give you a fruit basket or a cookie bouquet  or something like that. 
[00:30:30]  All right?  Because we do listen to the show.  Also, I was saying earlier, right?  You guys came in.  You go into the men's room.  Usually it smells like, you know, warm snake urine.  All right, but we go into the men's room.  I've been here five freaking years.  You know, you'd be hard-pressed to even find toilet paper in there.  Today there's potpourri.  What is the potpourri?  There's a bowl filled with potpourri.  And as I said earlier, it's like, you know, how quickly a men's room turns to a glory hole.  Just add potpourri.  Potpourri.  But, you know, it is out of place because it's just a stark bathroom with the urinals on 
[00:31:00]  the wall.  And all of a sudden, in a far corner, is this colorful potpourri.  Well, they bring in beer for your show every day, right, Nick?  I like that feature.  You know, what they're doing.  I still owe for the beer that they used to get me when I was on afternoon.  Oh, by the way, I just want to send a couple of quick shout-out.  I want to send a shout-out to Matt and Huggy of YSP, who you guys know.  Oh, yeah.  Matt and Huggy, very nice.  I want to send a shout-out to my boy, Cousin Ed, holding it down the midday of YSP, another  Opie and Anthony refugee.  For real, Cug. 
[00:31:30]  Heading for the borders of Pakistan.  At least you still talk to us.  When we were in Philly, we got a nod from Cousin Ed.  Oh, the best one.  It was like, you know, we got a slight nod.  Like, two weeks after the show had come on, I called up for something else, and he picks  up the phone.  He doesn't say hello.  He goes, are you mad at me?  Like, no, no, I'm cool.  Cracker.  Cracker.  Cracker.  Cracker is.  Cracker.  Well, you know, the barbs were thrown years back, and people never thought we'd even be on 
[00:32:00]  speaking terms.  Oh, dude, the email I get now, to this day, like, I got an email today, and it's like  some guy said, I heard you going across the street to take on Dopey and Anus, they suck.  And I'm like, dude, you know what?  I don't, people just don't want us to get along.  And at this point, I'm like, dude, you know what, honestly, and people try to, like, you  know, start static and run.  Yeah, of course.  And people are like, how can you stand by?  How do you get along with them, dude?  I'm like, dude, you know what?  My check clears no matter when I'm on.  That's all I care about.  Well, people like to think we just got fired.  It's a long time.  And we've been associated with WBCN longer than our old station. 
[00:32:30]  Yep.  That's right.  That's a fact.  And we could all unite in our hatred of that fat, tool, imbecile rock hall.  Well, I was the dickhead who came up with the idea.  It's like, hey, let's bring Opie and Anthony back.  Hey, you know what?  We can reintroduce him on the Boston Airwaves on my show.  Have him call in a couple of times a week.  All right.  Nice.  Oh, gosh.  What are you, guilting?  No, not at all.  You're making us feel bad.  Oh, dude, I drive in today, right? 
[00:33:00]  I come in today, and I'm like, I come into the garage.  And, you know, the board op for Howard shows and the one jocks.  Oh, did I take your parking spot?  And I come in, and I go, and I go, who the frick drives a Pathfinder with New York Plains?  And I roll down the window, and the maintenance guy goes, oh, that dance car.  I didn't know where else to put it.  So he's like, in your spot.  Oh, Nick.  Nick, I didn't know you parked there.  Yeah, you know what?  That's cold, bro.  If I'd known that was going to happen, I would have taken the bus in. 
[00:33:30]  You know, I'm local.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Damn.  Yeah, you know, management at all these stations we visit are not doing us a favor.  They're trying to treat us nice and make us feel at home, like with the foosball table and the beer and stuff.  It pisses off the air staff.  It pisses off the guys that are, you know, at BCN every freaking day.  I'm not even pissed off as much as I'm realistic.  I know that, you know, you guys are done Tuesday, Tuesday 7-0-1.  All right, back it up.  Back up to you all.  All right.  All right, let's go.  Nick, they'll do anything for us. 
[00:34:00]  What do you want, man?  Yeah.  Wow.  We'll hook you up.  Oh, I'll get a laundry list going.  Like when we were in Philly, a bunch of the staff came up to us and said, thanks a lot for coming down here.  They never feed us.  Oh, yeah.  The only reason they're feeding us today is because you guys are here.  Oh, yeah.  I believe it.  I believe it.  Look at this.  Visiting dignitaries, O.P. and Anthony.  It's like, yeah, the air staff always seems to act like the people in a convenience store that's being robbed.  And the guys at the guns are hiding, but they told you don't tip anyone off or we'll shoot you. 
[00:34:30]  They all have that smile and go, yeah, help us.  Help us.  Right.  Well, you notice I'm the only jock who's here.  Yeah.  You know, I mean, you know, three o'clock I could have been out the door.  Three o'clock and none of the other jocks are here.  So, yeah.  Yeah, and then in Philly, a bunch of the people that are associated with our show, they're just smoking pot everywhere.  Yeah.  And the gang down there, they were too scared to tell us to stop.  Yeah, because Stinky's like smoking weed like it's going to start ripping it up across the globe. 
[00:35:00]  And the place reeked of weed.  We're like the kid from the Twilight Zone movie.  Anthony.  Anthony.  Now.  Do you remember that?  Okay, sit down, Anthony.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'll send you to the cornfield.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Everyone was too scared to tell us, you know, well, maybe you guys shouldn't be smoking pot openly.  That'll end someday, but let's enjoy it now.  I do feel a little short-changed because Philly brought, you know, like the whole caravan of freaks down there.  Like, I was kind of hoping the retarded Laverne and Shirley would come because the sense I get, well, the sense I get is. 
[00:35:30]  How are you, Mick?  How are you?  No, but the sense I get just from listening to them on the radio and you guys paint a very healthy mental picture,  but the sense I get is it's nothing compared to, like, live and about.  No, when you're sitting with them in person.  It's as real as it gets.  It's horrific.  Yeah, yeah.  It really is.  And what they say to you off the air is ten times worse and more annoying than anything they could say on the air.  I can't believe they come back and stalk her, Patty.  It's like the abuse you've done them.  Patty, well, I had to sit right next to Patty during the U2 show at the garden with her freshly shaved head. 
[00:36:00]  Nice.  So she could have the tickets.  And her plastic hair.  And her plastic Lego person hair that she put on her head.  It was awful.  And she doesn't stop.  She doesn't shut up.  She looks like a claymation with that hair.  Something from a tool video.  Davian Goliath.  Some horrifying claymation thing from a tool video.  Well, the next time we come to Boston, we're going to have to do a full-blown road show and all that.  Yeah, we'll do that.  We're kind of glomming on to the WBCN event, really.  Yeah.  It's a Halloween party with the Crystal Method. 
[00:36:30]  We don't really have to do much, right?  Just get on the stage, say hi, check out some costumes.  Well, in years past when I used to host it.  Oh, no, I'm just kidding.  Oh, gosh.  Damn.  No, you don't do anything.  Wow.  Come on.  See, because, no, because you know everybody in the papers is sitting home listening like,  and Nick jibed them with this one, Buck.  No, you know, we're just, you know, this is a...  Are you enjoying midday?  Is it...  Tonight, you guys, you get up on stage, and...  I just want to know. 
[00:37:00]  Is like, are the hours better?  Is it kind of, you know...  You know...  No.  Okay.  All right.  Just kidding.  I'm happy to have a job here at Infinity Broadcasting at WBCN.  That's all that matters.  You know what's smooth everything over, man?  If you happen to be in Jersey this week, and you want to come see me at Rascal's...  Oh, you whore!  Oh, you whore!  You are a whore.  You are just a whore.  No, I'm just trying to smooth everything over.  I'll be in Ocean Township, 732-517-0002. 
[00:37:30]  He's smooth like X, like how he just, like, slid out.  And the first thing you have said in 20 minutes has to be a plug.  I know, I guess.  Get the people to love you first.  You're right.  Honestly, I've got to give it to him.  I'm amazed.  Like I was saying earlier, I'm amazed that retired Laverne and Shirley and stalker Patty  come back just after all the abuse.  Especially him.  Jesus Christ.  No one's ruthless with people, yeah.  Send us an asbestos postcard when you get to hell.  You are unbelievable to them.  Well, if you've ever seen the retarded Laverne and Shirley, you would understand. 
[00:38:00]  I think Nick understands more than you know.  You know this, man?  It just bugs me that there are women that I want to have sex with so little.  It's like the nerve of you to be so unsexually attractive.  I'm married.  It doesn't matter.  I got a husband.  I don't need you.  I don't need you, Norton.  Yeah, it's great that you're not sexual.  She's just like a 5'8 malignant tumor with a bad wig. 
[00:38:30]  You're a 5'8 malignant tumor.  Exactly.  It's a big comeback every time she'll just repeat what you said.  I noticed that.  Ooh, you just want to punch her in that head.  The minor bird thing.  That helmet that she wears, that she calls her hair.  Hey, one of the guys that was at lunch with us is on the line.  Oh, which one?  Is that the national line?  Yeah, if we go to line two, Chris, on the national line, let's see what he thought of Jim Norton.  Chris, what's up?  What's up, man?  How you doing?  All right.  You were at the luncheon today?  Yeah, I was at the luncheon today, man.  Which one were you?  Oh, yeah.  Cool.  Did you shake hands with Jim Norton?  Yeah, it was quite the experience, man. 
[00:39:00]  Why didn't you say anything?  I was looking at him.  We were looking at him.  I watched my boss's face.  And it was...  Wait, wait, wait.  Let Anthony explain again, because we probably have a whole new audience.  Well, Norton, who's here with us up in Boston, we met a bunch of people at the brunch today.  Our luncheon.  A bunch of clients, hopefully, will be supporting this program.  And we're shaking hands and taking pictures.  We introduced our own Jim Norton.  And what Norton had done is dipped his hand in a cold drink so it was just wet and cold. 
[00:39:30]  And then gave him the limp-wristed fish hand handshake, where it's like you are grabbing onto a damp bar rack.  Give it to Nick real fast, just so...  No, don't give me this thing.  It's not wet.  No, no, just the...  Look at what he's doing.  That's what he does.  He lays his hand in your hand.  There's no squeeze, no grip.  It's just a corpse hand.  And if you're wet it, it's like putting your hand in cold oatmeal, right?  Yeah.  And he does the shake, too.  You know, he's not only shaking hands, he's shaking the whole body.  Yeah, he goes like this.  Yeah, he, like, convulses a little bit. 
[00:40:00]  It's as if Christopher Reeve was giving you a handshake.  Yeah.  Probably, Christopher Reeve probably has a better grip.  Yeah.  And it was just this limp-wristed thing.  And then what happened?  What were you thinking about that?  Yeah, because Jim did this to everyone that was at the luncheon, and we were so surprised  that not one person said anything.  I looked at him, I said, hey, Norton.  He looks over and he gives me the handshake.  I'm like, this guy's effing with me.  I'm like, I knew he was.  Oh, you thought so.  You didn't say anything, though.  And then he starts shaking hands with my boss and another guy I work with and a couple other  people, and I knew, and they didn't have a clue, you know? 
[00:40:30]  I'm thinking, this guy is more whack than I ever thought, you know?  He's sitting there at a client luncheon, people all done up in suits.  We're kind of laid back at Redble, you know what I mean?  These guys all done up in suits and, like, just hanging out and going.  Oh, serious.  I got to explain.  Serious media buyers were there.  Yeah, really.  Really, really nice suits, and Norton didn't care.  He was giving the limp handshake to every one of them.  It's like millions of dollars on the line, and it makes no difference to him.  No, no.  He's just, uh.  Unbelievable.  All right, Chris. 
[00:41:00]  We had a good time with you, man.  Later on, dude.  All right, cool.  Let's go to Laura on the national line, on line four there.  Laura?  We got to explain.  We have to tell the folks back in New York which phone to go to.  Laura, what's up?  Hey, guys.  How are you?  Good.  How are you?  Pretty good.  I just want to say hi.  You got something?  What?  What, do we got that Afghanistan delay that we're on?  Yeah, we got the slight delay that's going to screw up.  What's happening?  Every phone call that we take today. 
[00:41:30]  Go ahead, Laura.  Hi.  I just want to say I love you, Joe.  That's it, Laura?  No.  That I'm trying to get down to BC and to see you, but I don't know if I'll be able to.  Come on.  What are you waiting for?  Yeah, we don't care how many people show up.  I think Oedipus cares, but we don't give a crap.  Well, I might say come tomorrow for Whip It Out Wednesday.  Well, tomorrow's Tuesday.  Tomorrow's Tuesday.  The problem is tomorrow's Tuesday.  And we don't like Whip It Out Wednesday.  I like that.  I'm going to steal Whip It Out Wednesday. 
[00:42:00]  Hey, Maddie, Whip It Out.  Whip It Out.  Well, I'd be trying to participate every week, so.  Well, we appreciate that.  All right, Laura?  Ma'am, do you have large chest?  Ma'am?  Are you asking me the size?  Yes.  38 C?  Oh.  Baby's got back.  You're a big gal, big gal.  I'll be flinching at the 38 number.  Yeah, but I'm not a big gal. 
[00:42:30]  Well, you've got big shoulders.  Just got a big, strong foreman's back.  Jordan, I think you're awesome.  Thank you.  All right, Laura, we've got to let you go, okay?  All right, is Nick Carter still there?  Yeah.  Nick's here.  I love him, too.  Okay, good.  All right.  Laura, this was a waste of a phone call.  Why don't you and your iron workers back come by tomorrow?  No, thank you, Laura.  Thanks, Laura.  All right, here's the deal.  Yeah, we're going to be here today and tomorrow,  and you can just stop by the WBCN Studios, 1265 Boyleson Street. 
[00:43:00]  We have lots to give away.  We've got the WOW bumper stickers.  We've got WOW t-shirts we're giving away to the first 250 people that show up today.  And I think we have some grave rape tickets for the show tonight at Avalon.  Cool.  With the crystal method.  So stop on by and say hi to us as we hang in Boston the next couple of days.  Also, boobalanner chicks.  Anyone show up yet?  Steve?  No.  We need girls within class.  I can't believe we're begging in two cities now.  Now, the definitive thing is they have to have faux boobs, right?  Because it doesn't work if it's regular.  Yeah, real boobs don't seem to get the light going in there. 
[00:43:30]  Have you seen the pictures yet on the website?  I said, no, wait.  Now, did they actually illuminate?  Because I saw the pictures quickly, but I got a Mac in a crash.  Can we go to the website?  I got a Mac.  One day I'm hoping to get a computer.  It looks like the Angry Red Planet.  Yeah, you've got to check this out.  It just glows.  It's a red ball.  Yeah.  Big red ball.  You can see the veins.  You can see the areole high.  Everything.  It's wonderful.  We're waiting for the first lady with breast implants to stop by.  Now, ladies, up here in Boston, we know that there are strippers around here. 
[00:44:00]  We know it, that have the implants that would turn a trick for $20.  We're talking the potential of a $1,000 prize you could be at.  We know.  Come on, please.  And we have a secret back room somewhere around here that we will find.  Yes, and we will clean out all those stolen CDs, and we'll take the pictures in there.  And you know how the strippers love a sweet-talking man.  Keep going.  Keep going.  Oh, God.  You know, screw them.  You know how chicks who get no respect whatsoever on a daily basis love to have it, you know, 
[00:44:30]  in their personal lives.  So go on.  You know, the road you choose.  Oh, get out.  That's phenomenal.  The road you choose.  Look at that.  Doesn't it look like one of those Mars Lander pictures or something?  That's like a scene from Battlestar Galactica.  It really is.  Why do women get mammograms?  I can see everything.  Right there.  Dr. Anthony says, we're looking at a shadowy area here.  Wow, that is nice.  But the women down there, you talk about that, though, the whole respect thing. 
[00:45:00]  That's the road you choose.  You know?  You think when a guy goes to any of those strip clubs, they want to hear him talk about  how they're only doing this for a year until they go to college?  Yeah.  I used to always find myself, you know, on the air, trapped in that conversation with the  stripper.  No, no, no.  I'm an exotic dancer.  It's like, look, you know, just find a talent, throw it.  You're never going to win that argument.  And it just annoys the crap out of me when you're waiting for her to get over to you, and she's  got to stop and drop and talk to the guy about her kids or something.  Jeez, it's hard enough getting my mind off of that C-section scar.  Don't tell me about what popped out of it. 
[00:45:30]  Stinky.  For crying out loud.  Stinky.  Our own stinky rules made the trip to Boston.  The first girl for the Boobalanta contest has arrived.  Oh, thank God.  And I meant to say, I love them all.  Well, why don't we take a break, and we'll see what she's all about next.  Nice.  Boston, I'm telling you, we only had five ladies show up in New York, so this is your  chance to show up in New York.  Yeah.  I'm convinced that Boston is going to outdo New York.  Yeah, wait, and since the pool is so small, conceivably, I mean, you know, your chances  of getting the cash are a lot better.  No doubt.  That's true.  I mean, we got three great prizes, Aerosmith tickets for either Philly, New York, or Boston, Samsung 
[00:46:00]  DVD player, and first prize is $1,000.  $1,000.  We got the flashlights.  Yeah.  And we'll talk to her next.  It's Opie and Anthony broadcasting live from Boston the next couple of days.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  It's like listening to Corky and Karen Quinlan.  Opie and Anthony.  I'd rather hear my penis in a place than listen to those jokes.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Anthony, we're talking about satellites. 
[00:46:30]  The satellites.  We're talking about dishes.  Dish satellite systems.  Dish Network satellite TV and digital satellite service are here to help you out with the  digital home plan.

[00:47:30]  What?  1027 WNEW.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony show, James Addiction, Mountain Song.  We had those guys in the studio recently.  Broadcasting live from Boston, the WBCN studios.  It's kind of a homecoming for us, Ant.  Yeah.  After the show, we're heading over to Lansdowne Street, and we're going to be part of the big  Halloween party at Avalon.  The Crystal Method will be there performing.  We'll be judging costumes and stuff, and basically just hanging out, really. 
[00:48:00]  Hanging out.  We can hang and party.  Don't have to worry about driving home.  I like that.  I like that a lot.  And then I don't have to be up until, what, 3 o'clock tomorrow.  There you have it.  Yeah, tomorrow's an easy day for us.  It could be a fun Noah luncheon tomorrow.  No, we could just sleep in.  No luncheon.  You like that, Jim?  We could sleep in tomorrow.  I'd rather meet with some more people.  Those guys were fun.  Jim was out cold during commercials.  Yeah.  And Nick Carter walks by and goes, hey, man, you all right?  You know.  Like, yeah, Nick doesn't really know the lay of the land yet. 
[00:48:30]  I don't know, man.  Just trying to watch out for the brother, you know?  I know.  He's just like, slow down.  You got a little OD going on over here.  Right.  Slow down.  But it's funny.  Hey, man, you all right?  Norton actually took a sleeper car on the train up to Boston.  I paid the extra upgrade myself just to try it.  Which I've never seen in real life.  My only thing, impressions of a sleeper car on a train up to Boston.  Like Lucy?  Sitcom.  Yeah.  I love Lucy, the Honeymooners.  Hey, Ralphie.  I thought maybe James B.C. King would chase me with a gun. 
[00:49:00]  I just, yeah, I picture the Little Rascals was another one.  Like, they're poking their head out of the sleeper car and the fireworks are going on.  How was your sleeper car?  It was, even first class on a train, you still feel like white trash.  There's no way to travel on a train and feel good.  Or maybe if you'd dress nicer or something.  I was just half naked in my bed.  How did you fly?  Nah, nah, because then I would have to land and go through rush hour traffic.  Landing is a part of the flight, sure.  Well, yeah. 
[00:49:30]  Usually.  Right.  No, hopefully.  You couldn't leave.  I didn't want to leave at 7 in the morning or 6 in the morning and land at 7 in Logan  and have to come in through rush hour traffic into Boston.  Well, there you go.  In the morning, so I'd rather just get right into Boston.  I'm proud of Jim.  He just did a little local thing for everybody here in Boston.  A little local.  For everybody here in Boston.  I was talking about Logan.  A little local.  That was good.  Oh, the old Logan thing?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You make up the time in rush hour traffic when you land at Logan because of the total  lack of security.  So you could just run right through.  It's not like...  Boy, you sons of bitches dropped the ball on that one, huh? 
[00:50:00]  Don't look at me.  I'm just a poor DJ.  You know what it is.  New York.  When we're in New York, and we're based in New York, obviously, we dealt with a horror  show with the World Trade Center coming down.  Was it 1.2 miles from the...  Yeah, yeah.  Actually, now it's north of us, if you go by Opie's calculations.  But so we dealt with that.  And there has been this underlying thing that's been like, F in Boston, man. 
[00:50:30]  You guys dropped the ball at Logan.  You let these sons of bitches on those planes.  So there's kind of this thing going on where Logan doesn't seem to be the...  And in the interview today with the Boston Globe, they were asking, well, what do you  think the mayor thinks about you coming back to Boston for the next couple of days?  I've got to figure if the mayor's got other stuff on his mind at this point.  That's exactly what I told the guy.  The guy goes, have you spoken with the mayor?  Has the mayor said anything about you coming back to Boston? 
[00:51:00]  Between the money being dumped into the big dig, being just a tad over budget, and him  being here, and the security at Logan, I think a couple of dopey DJs coming back to Boston  is the least of his worries.  Well, you know the New York thing.  Like, New Yorkers always come to Boston, and they're always like, you know, they sit  and they talk about New York and how great...  And I went to school in New York, and I lived in New York for five years, and New York's  a great city.  But people come from New York, and they're like, ah, this is great pizza.  Ah, you get the real pizza in New York, buddy.  You know, and people sit there and come to Boston and talk about how great, you know, 
[00:51:30]  New York is.  Don't make fun of our raised pizza.  No, but...  Which one?  You know, so...  But then, you know, Bostonians get the point where they're like, well, if it's so freaking  great, go back there.  Now, you know, they come over here, and it's like, you can't say anything.  But you guys got the colleges.  Oh, yeah, that's nice.  I mean, we got a couple cool colleges in New York.  We'd like to go back to New York, but guided missiles keep coming out of Boston and hitting  our goddamn city.  So, perhaps, if things were tidied up here, it's kind of...  It's kind of nice to walk around Boston knowing that you're not going to get the anthrax. 
[00:52:00]  That's kind of nice.  Yeah, any...  We haven't had any anthrax up here?  Do you guys have any real anthrax scares up here?  Not yet.  Not really.  Because every city has the fake anthrax scare, but they haven't found any yet or anything  like that up here?  Nothing.  I mean, you know, nothing really that's been reported, as far as we know, because that's  the thing.  You know, at this point, you could see some guy walking around with the flu.  Yeah.  And he's a walking bag of anthrax, and you don't know.  Yeah, yeah.  So, officially, no.  Nothing major.  And then any pile of powder or anything in New York, people just go crazy. 
[00:52:30]  Nick, in New York, we have guys in spacesuits opening our mail.  No joke.  Oh, yeah.  No joke.  Oh, yeah.  It's a matter of...  We don't even know who is opening the mail, because you cannot see their faces.  Well, you know, we're doing a thing, trying to pitch in everything, too.  And, you know, every Thursday on my midday shift, we do, like, a fun for the families  Red Cross auction.  So, we just auctioned off a trip from the WBCN Hazardous Materials team, which is me and  Callie.  You know, we'll come to your office and open up your mail.  Open up your mail.  Right?  Well, Callie's going to open the mail in the biohazard suit. 
[00:53:00]  Well, I'm just going to sit there and stare at the receptionist's ass without a drink  coffee.  That's pretty funny.  Hey, there's a guy that was at the luncheon that we got to talk to.  Ah, let's see if he shook hands with Jim Norton.  Yeah, Dave on line nine.  With his clammy hand.  On the national line.  Here we go.  Dave, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, Owen?  Hey, how you doing?  You were at the luncheon today?  Yeah, actually, I was...  I talked to you guys for about a couple of seconds, but I was in no way going to shake  Jim Norton's hand.  Why?  Why?  Because I just knew he was going to pull something.  He's got a sexy voice. 
[00:53:30]  Put it this way.  It's like, I know how you guys hate those things yourself.  I felt evil for standing in there.  I had a couple of Jackson Colts and had to leave.  It's sort of like Demi Moore with a...  Hey, you brought that with you.  I love the beef.  We could do some Tom Brokaw today.  Cool.  Hey, go...  Yourself.  All right.  Thanks, Dave.  All right, guys.  Hey, let's go to Payphone Jeff on line seven. 
[00:54:00]  Jeff?  Oh, wait.  We got to...  There we go.  Hey, Jeff, what's going on?  Nothing, man.  I'm just here at downtown Boston, man.  I'm just been sitting there on the payphone, popping quarters of the machine, man, trying  to get tickets to that thing tonight, you know?  I just think we're in the morning.  Some, you know, some yuppie with a cell phone with a redoubt button on it, you know?  Can't we do something like the first 20 people that show up at the studios gets tickets  for the...  I know, but damn, I'm stuck here at downtown working, man.  I can't get down there.  Like, right away.  What do you want, is to walk to your office with the tickets?  We're trying to work with you here. 
[00:54:30]  Just put them on hold.  I'll come down and get them out to work.  I'd really appreciate it, fellas, you know?  Yeah, we could do that.  All right.  Hey, good luck.  Yeah, we'll hook you up.  All right, Jeff.  All right.  Thanks a lot, fellas.  Keep it up, all right?  All right.  Hold on, and someone will talk to you, okay?  Good looking out.  All right, but let's do that.  The first 20 people that show up at the WBCN studios here in Boston, we'll give you  grave-rave tickets for tonight's show, okay?  Do you think you ought to save some for the chicks who come down with the boobo lanterns?  That'll be fine.  We'll give them some, too, sure.  How many do we have to give away? 
[00:55:00]  I don't know, man.  Tons.  There you go.  Yeah, sure.  1265 Boyle's history.  We have lots to give away.  We're throwing out WOW t-shirts out front and WOW bumper stickers, and we'll have some  grave-rave tickets, and we have boobo lantern chicks showing up.  Well, please save the tickets for them.  You know, Clark Kent calls from a phone booth, and we're supposed to throw 40 tickets at him.  He doesn't even want to show up for them.  We have a boobo lantern girl here?  Diana?  Diana?  What's up, Diana? 
[00:55:30]  Get up.  Oh, wow.  Hey!  You're a slender girl, and you didn't go crazy with your implants.  No, I didn't.  What made you get the implants?  Lift up that mic a little more, so she can...  You don't come off to me as a stripper.  Well, let's ask where she's from and all that.  No.  Where are you from?  New Hampshire.  New Hampshire, okay.  And you came down to help us out with the contest?  Yep.  Yep.  Oh, Rick.  That was down, Rick.  Whatever.  Just talking to a little kidney bean.  Yeah.  All right.  Okay.  Now, why did you get the implants?  I mean, ever since I was 17, I had small, you know what, and... 
[00:56:00]  Is it a blaze?  Itty-bitty...  No, there were 32 bees.  There were 32 bees.  I kind of felt like my butt was a little too big for what I had up there.  A little anorexia nervosa happened there, no?  No, no.  I'm pretty flat.  No, because you don't look like you're wide or anything.  Kind of.  Let me see.  Turn around.  No, you look fine.  That is interesting.  Get the boobs to it, like, just even out the butt.  Yeah, that's something.  Isn't that great?  That's Jim Norton, and he's got a rod outage. 
[00:56:30]  But he's only holding how much?  Six?  Well, I have a full rod outage.  Oh, okay.  I still like to shake Jim's hand.  Did we take her pictures?  No, I heard about his clammy hand.  No, it's not clammy now.  It's driving.  It's still awful.  Yeah.  And are we putting the pictures up?  Scott's downloading them right now.  Okay, cool.  We're taking a lot of pictures as we hang out here in Boston, and you can check out some  of those pictures on opianthony.com.  So, Nat, now, what made you get them, though? 
[00:57:00]  Did you get them, though?  You just were for yourself, or were guys kind of chuckling when you took your shirt off?  No, no.  I just wanted them for myself.  You wanted them for yourself.  I love them.  God, I got them.  How big are they now?  They're around 34Ds.  Wow.  34D.  Wow.  You know something?  They're wearing bra.  Look, they're all kind of...  Because I was going to say, because, like, you know, if you look at her just initially,  you can't automatically go, oh, fake bazooms.  Right.  Right.  Phenomenal.  No, they look pretty real.  Would you share those with the studio uncovered? 
[00:57:30]  Yeah.  All right.  Did we get a before picture, too?  Yeah.  Oh, nice.  What does those look like, Opie?  She's taking the whole shirt off.  She's doing that Harry Houdini bra removal thing that guys just are dumbfounded by.  Wow.  Wait, wait, wait.  You want to dim the lights so you get the optimum...  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Can we turn off all the lights in here?  Those are very...  That's a very nice boob job.  Wow.  Look at that.  We've seen some horror shows in New York.  That's pretty nice.  That's pretty good.  All right, Nick.  Check this out.  Check this out.  Now, Rick's got the flashlights. 
[00:58:00]  We're putting them under the boobs and watch them light up.  Oh, that was great.  That is fantastic.  It's on the floor.  Isn't that an amazing trick?  Oh, my God.  That's great.  That's an amazing trick.  I know it's a visual, but the pictures will be up on opianthony.com.  This girl has beautiful breast implants.  They may be the nicest implants I've ever seen.  There's a righteous vein going on there, too.  Isn't that nice?  That's right.  Nice.  It's like a road map.  Do they feel real, too?  Yeah.  Good. 
[00:58:30]  Do you have a gentleman friend?  Yes, I do.  Yeah.  I've got to ask you this.  Were you with him when you got the implants?  No, I was single.  You were single?  Yeah.  So now, I've got to think that the TF is the most popular move with you in bed, right?  Are guys always going for the TF?  No, not really.  I've been with him.  He's the only one I've been with since I had him done.  Yeah.  Selfish bastard, Cher.  Something new.  Something different, Cher. 
[00:59:00]  Yeah.  Well, I think we've got a finalist, Anthony.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  Where are we taking these pictures of the girls?  The secret room.  Did we find the secret room?  Shachi has donated his office.  Yeah.  Okay.  As long as he gets to sit in and watch.  Nice.  What a shocker, though.  The one guy she's been with since she had the boobs wants the TF, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  The virgin TF.  Nice.  Alright, so her pictures are done and they'll be up on opandanthony.com, our first Boston  girl that has entered the Booba Lantern Contest.  Very solid.  Thank you. 
[00:59:30]  What kind of work do you do?  Right now, I'm a student and I work at Costco Wholesale.  Yeah, you're using those implants for just your personal life.  Yeah.  You want us to call Matthews or something?  Yeah.  No, I did work at a strip club just as a waitress, though.  Oh.  I wouldn't strip.  That's like...  Would you care to make an extra 300 tonight?  No.  No.  The hard way?  No.  I always felt those girls that just ten bar or waitress at the booby bars are just  like two champagnes away from getting up on that stage and going to town. 
[01:00:00]  Oh, yeah.  I was tempted, but...  You were?  Didn't do it?  At the same time, I just...  Maybe when they were closing.  Yeah.  I wasn't too happy with that.  Is there like a pecking order, a hierarchy over there?  You know, you kind of like look down on the stripper girls because, you know, you have  the fake boobs, but you only serve drinks.  Yeah, I know.  What the hell is that all about?  That's confusing.  No.  Okay.  They're phenomenal.  Yeah, they really are.  Oh, my God.  Great job.  Can we check them out again?  Please?  She just put them back. 
[01:00:30]  She just put them back in the box.  I'll go on the internet and check them out.  I can check them out on the internet.  Over and over again.  All right.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Well, that's great.  New Hampshire representing.  Representing, yo.  Yeah.  Yo, B.  They just look healthy and lovely.  That's the thing.  Like, you look at them and initially, like you said, she's got a black sweater on it.  Initially, it's kind of deceiving because, you know, they don't look like they're billowing  out and look all phony.  But then she pulls them up and it's like, thwack.  She got that bra that kind of pushes them over out the top of the bra. 
[01:01:00]  Yeah.  So, it's a whole bunch of stuff up there until she takes it off.  It was false advertising.  Very good.  Yeah.  Well, in a good way.  I think there's no way this girl has breast implants.  She's on that couch.  Has that couch seen some action or what?  Oh, my God.  He can't even begin to tell.  Really?  Really?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  The weekend afternoons, I came in with the fluorescent light and I was just like, oh,  God.  My resignation is here.  Let me sign it.  Oh.  She had eight cups, too.  Before that.  Yeah.  She got tired when she was 19 of men trying to get her in the car with candy. 
[01:01:30]  Oh.  I'm sure with a black light on that, a black light on that couch.  Between Parenteau alone, it probably looks like an explosion.  An explosion at Peter Max's house.  And we put a black light on that pregnant thing.  Look at these.  Look at all these inside jokes from Boston today.  Hey, look.  Peter Allen signed his name.  Let's go to line four and say hi to Sonny in D.C.  Hello?  Ah.  Calling from D.C.  Sonny, what's going on, bro? 
[01:02:00]  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  Hey, man.  We're going to be there next Monday.  Oh, cool.  Guys, I love you.  But, Opie, I know you meant well last week.  Yeah.  This curse is a big thing.  Now, deep down, you wanted the Yankees to win, but you said Arizona.  It's not over yet.  No, guys.  It looks very good.  What?  What?  Dude, he didn't.  I was walking with Opie today.  He really wants the Diamondbacks.  I'm telling you.  No, it's not that he wants.  He honestly believes the Diamondbacks will win.  Let me tell you.  But, look. 
[01:02:30]  It looks very grim for the Yankees.  Let me tell you.  I was talking to someone here in Boston, and they're like, you know, as a Met fan, are  you now rooting for the Yankees because the Mets are out of it?  I'm like, no.  True Mets fans don't want the Yankees to win.  Opie.  Mm-hmm.  I'm serious.  Yes.  Opie.  Yes, Sonny.  I love you guys.  We want the Yankees to win.  Just pretend for the next week or so that baseball doesn't even exist.  Pretend.  It doesn't exist.  Let me explain something to you. 
[01:03:00]  Quiet.  Let me explain something to you.  The CIA has made it so that the Yankees have to win to give New York the distraction it  needs from the bombs that were sent over from Boston.  I know, but Opie?  So...  Opie has caution.  Quiet.  That's all I have.  That's all I have.  They will emerge victorious.  Really so much?  Please.  How about we shoot something in this guy's mouth and shut him up?  Yeah.  Well, that would work.  If he says something, do that.  Don't worry.  And if he says something, just shoot him in the mouth.  We don't have the power to hang up on this guy from here? 
[01:03:30]  No, no.  Sonny, thank you.  We'll see you in D.C. next week, okay?  There he goes.  He's got it.  Let's go to line five, just Chris.  Is this Kid Chris from KXOA in Sacramento?  Is it?  KXOA, not Kid Chris, though.  Oh, it's just another Chris from KXOA.  Yeah, I'm kind of like your guys' producer.  Say it right, Arby.  KXOA.  That is it.  I see your guys bored off.  I record the show and stuff like that.  Oh, cool.  What's up, Chris?  I have a couple questions for you guys.  Is the boob girl still there? 
[01:04:00]  She's wandering around somewhere.  I was wondering if Opie can do an age verification on her.  She didn't seem like she was game for that.  No, it's a special girl.  See, it's a special girl that lets Opie verify her age by looking into her taint.  I see.  And it's also hand-in-hand with the same girls that will do the wiffle ball bat challenge.  Quite frankly, I wouldn't mind showing off my skills today while we're in Boston.  Well, maybe we'll get lucky.  One of the girls for the boob-a-lantern contest will let you look at her taint and guess her age. 
[01:04:30]  Didn't you think for a second when she first came in she just looked much too wholesome?  Yeah.  You thought for a second this was a plant.  It didn't look like a girl that would get implants.  Yeah.  Which just goes to show you it's probably very deceiving.  She looks very wholesome.  A girl next door.  Yeah.  All right, Chris.  Thank you.  Hey, one more thing for you guys.  Gives up the A, everything, right?  Right?  Who's kidding who?  Yes, Chris.  I wonder if Norton can give me a quick It Stinks and an Awful so I can record him on soundbite.  What is...  And play him throughout the rest of the day on everybody else's show? 
[01:05:00]  That's what's going on with some of our stuff.  All right.  Chris, he'll just do it.  Just wait for it.  Yeah, he'll do it, right?  It's got to be natural.  Thanks, guys.  Hope to see you guys out here soon, man.  Thanks, bro.  For the taint check, man, maybe that chick with the back could come in tomorrow and maybe  lift a big barbell while she's there and check out the taint.  The 38C, was she?  She was right.  38's a little too big for the back, right? 
[01:05:30]  Well, it's a little too big.  No, 38's not that big.  38's not that big, right?  It's not bad.  It's starting to lean on the large size.  If you're 38A, there's a problem.  38A is a little rough.  Flatso.  38D, 38DD, not bad.  Yeah, you see that?  Like Rosie O'Donnell, you call her a flatso.  She really is.  She's a big fat woman, and it sucks for them because they don't even get the joy of having  the huge fat cans that are just big sloppy things.  They're pretty much flat.  Yeah.  Flatso's, they're called. 
[01:06:00]  Body like a sub sandwich.  It's just disgusting.  Shaped like a pear.  Yeah.  Big ass, big gut, and just no cans.  It's just an awful, fat, self-righteous mess.  What?  Yeah, I think you're getting it.  Yeah, why not?  Fat creep.  All right, we should take a break.  We'll take a breather.  I think Tom Brokaw's stopping by today.  He is?  Hell yeah, he is.  Hell yeah.  I hope he hasn't been drinking.  Will from Philly writes, nice Boston pics of Norton. 
[01:06:30]  Was he one of the Jewish concentration camp victims on Band of Brothers last night?  Oh, I miss Band of Brothers.  We got pictures up of our Boston visit?  Oh, cool.  Go to opianthony.com.  We'll take a quick break.  We'll be back.  If you're in the New York area, we want to talk to you guys.  877-692-1027.  Don't be an a-hole.  Don't be an a-hole.  You seem a little drunk, Anthony.  Don't ask yourself, okay. 
[01:07:00]  Here, check it out, the Opie and Anthony Show.  We're broadcasting live from Boston.  What are you guys last met over there?  The boob-a-lantern pictures.  Oh, this is the girl that we just checked out in the studio,  and now you guys can check her out on opianthony.com.  Holy cow.  Wow.  She might win the whole damn thing.  Those things are glowing.  Holy cow.  Those are nice.  Another little tuck right there.  There we go.  Yeah.  Let me ask you, what exactly is going to be the criteria?  Is it going to be size, or is it going to be the actual, like, the glow? 
[01:07:30]  It's going to be up to the listeners.  We didn't really think that out, Nick.  I think it's good.  Yeah, the listeners are going to look at the pictures and vote accordingly.  They're going to vote for their favorite boob-a-lantern girl.  It's like, well, this one's really big, but this one's brighter, though.  I don't know.  Exactly.  Exactly.  We don't care how they come to their decision as long as they help us out with the contest.  All right.  Couldn't a guy have pulled that one over?  Sorry.  Maybe I'm over.  She has one of the nicest sets I've ever seen. 
[01:08:00]  You like that, Norton?  Yeah.  Beyond comprehension.  I like that.  What are you, just, like, glossing over the whole, uh, the glowing thing and just critiquing  the actual surgery now, Ant?  Yeah, I was looking at the, uh, that picture right there.  Oh, man.  Yeah.  I like that.  Well, and there.  Looks a little cockeyed.  Natural.  Oh, no.  Yeah, that's the weird thing.  It just looks like maybe the right one there had a shot of Novocaine, uh, right before the  picture was taken.  You know how your lip gets, right?  It could happen.  A little limp.  She may have had a stroke.  Oh, God. 
[01:08:30]  She is now.  She's listening.  She's hot, man.  Those are so...  You know what?  You guys are idiots, though, man.  We're going to ruin it.  I know.  No other girls will want to come down, either today or tomorrow, to do the contest.  They always wreck it.  We're such idiots.  Dude, I think they're perfect.  She's so...  Yeah.  So, if you have anything bad to say, say it in front of her face.  I didn't have anything bad to say.  Okay.  That's true.  Because that's what's going to happen.  There's probably girls on the Mass Pike right now looking at me being local.  Look at you.  And, uh, they're turning around.  They don't want to come by now.  Right, because they're looking down and going, uh, mine are a little asymmetrical, so I don't 
[01:09:00]  know if I really want to...  Yeah.  Oh.  But if they're coming from Route 128...  What?  Hey!  Gordon, you fool.  You know.  Don't forget 495.  Yeah, well.  And Route 9.  Lots of lights on Route 9, don't you?  Yeah, but not as many as by the back bay station.  You know.  Look at you.  All right, well...  Regular Atlas.  Yes.  We're on Boylston Street in Boston, 1265.  Oh!  Oh, sorry. 
[01:09:30]  I thought you were making another reference.  Well, I have to give out the address, because we're handing out...  It's right behind Fenway Park.  It can't be.  Yeah, we're handing out WOW bumper stickers.  We're handing out WOW t-shirts.  They look really cool.  And we're handing out Grave Rave tickets, because right after this, we're going to Avalon  for the big show with the Crystal Method.  Oh, yeah.  So a lot of people want those tickets.  All you have to do at this point is stop by WBCN Studios.  We're handing them out on the sidewalk, okay?  Yep.  And then, of course, some more girls will come by for the Boober Lantern Contest.  Yeah.  All right.  Can we go to line two on the National?  Eric. 
[01:10:00]  Eric has a question for us today.  Eric, what's up?  What is that?  No, it's...  What was that?  Oh.  Eric, what's up?  What's up?  Hey, man.  You hear me?  Tell us.  Yeah, go ahead.  Yeah, turn that radio down.  Oh.  Oh, my God.  Turn down your radio.  I can hear you.  Okay, what do you got?  All right, what do you got?  All right.  First, you guys are great.  Norton's one funny MF-er.  Thanks, bro.  How did your little pumpkin carving party go this weekend? 
[01:10:30]  Oh.  Wait a minute.  Did you go?  Hold it.  You said there was no way in hell.  You actually...  Ben wanted to bet you.  You were going.  He didn't go.  And you said, if you're so confident, I'm not going.  Bet me.  Did you go?  Thanks for calling, Eric.  Did he go?  He went.  Pumpkin carving.  You went to the pumpkin carving?  He was there.  All right, listen. 
[01:11:00]  Shut up, Mr. Freaking Crow.  You look completely ridiculous.  The only guy that showed up in a costume.  So, shut up.  There you go.  It was supposed to be a pumpkin carving night.  A party.  Party.  This is Rick's circle of friends.  They sit around and have fondue and stuff.  Some of them are your friends, too.  Fondue.  It's the fondue crowd.  I enjoy them until you pull out the fondue sticks.  Oh, dude.  You were one of the first people there.  I don't want to hear it.  You guys both stink.  That's awful.  So, now...  There you go, Chris, in Sacramento. 
[01:11:30]  You got your...  Friday.  If I remember this.  Friday.  Opie said, there is no way in hell I will be at the pumpkin carving party.  I am going to go with Joey Paisano and watch the World Series.  Hello?  Game was over in the third inning.  I had to do something.  So, carve a pumpkin is the option?  I did not carve a pumpkin.  So, I had a standing room only at the glory hole?  Did you just sit there and sip cocoa out of an orange pumpkin-shaped mug? 
[01:12:00]  But you said there was no way in hell you were going.  I went.  Yeah, I went.  And the peer pressure was brutal.  Everyone was getting mad at me because I was the only one that didn't carve a pumpkin.  But this was supposed to be costume only.  To even get in, you had to be dressed.  I did not have a costume.  Rick, did I have a costume on?  No.  I know you didn't.  All right, Rick.  I know you wouldn't do that.  But Rick now shows up in costume.  And he is the only one in costume.  I'm the only one.  Rick showed up as the crow. 
[01:12:30]  It was the lamest...  It was the lamest...  It's not bad.  The crow.  Your makeup was horrible.  Of course it was.  I put it on ten minutes before I got there.  Was everyone calling you Sting from wrestling?  No.  No?  And then he's getting pissed off because he can't eat the chicken wings.  I'm the crow, you idiot.  I'm not Sting.  You know what?  He's getting pissed off because he can't eat the chicken wings.  Oh, yeah.  I can't eat anything.  Because it's smearing his black lipstick.  And he didn't bring the black lipstick with him.  So, he's like, this sucks.  I can't eat because it's smearing my makeup.  You know, the crow is only a good costume if you're accidentally shot while wearing it. 
[01:13:00]  Believe me, I want it to be shot for being the only one to show up with one.  So, and then...  What about Linda?  Linda was dressed as an angel.  Yeah, but she's a girl.  It's like girls are normal.  She had the little angel wings.  That's cute.  And she was giving me the business, yelling and screaming.  Not yelling, but really just being a pain in the ass because I wouldn't carve a damn pumpkin.  So, you wouldn't even carve a pumpkin.  You sat there. 
[01:13:30]  You watched everyone carve pumpkins.  I got to tell you, dude.  It was the gayest thing I've ever seen.  Was it?  Yes.  Was it free form or stencil?  It was free form.  Wow.  Free form.  Oh, come on, dude.  You were sitting there saying, now, Sandy, you make sure you cut that correct.  He was overseeing.  I had to believe I cared.  He was overseeing.  He was the GC.  She's sitting right over there.  Ask her if I cared, really.  Did he care?  Yes.  Yes, he cared.  Sandy says yes.  You were coaching her pumpkin carving?  What'd you do?  Just sit there and sip a little clear stuff? 
[01:14:00]  They would...  All right, listen.  What'd you do with the seeds?  Dry them?  I...  They put in hell raisin.  You cook them up.  You oven dry them, right?  And you put some salt on them and roll them around.  And you bake them.  Put a hat on the pumpkin, everybody laughs.  Let me tell the story.  We go to Steve's house, Steve and Claire's.  Suck a big...  And go home.  We go to their house.  Wow.  And we're sitting...  We're sitting around viewing the Boogeyman DVD. 
[01:14:30]  Ah, there you go.  So that was very enjoyable.  Okay.  And then all of a sudden, someone said, hey, everybody, it's time to carve the pumpkin.  Wait, everything got to stop?  Yeah.  Ah, all right.  I'm like, ugh.  I guess the pumpkins were outside the apartment, right?  Right.  At the top of the stairs.  And they bought nine or ten, right?  So, hey, everyone, pick out your pumpkin.  Ooh, that's an exciting part of the night.  So everyone goes running, and I'm staying on the couch. 
[01:15:00]  And I'm like...  No, back it up.  I didn't run.  I was sitting down next to you watching TV.  I'm in the crow costume, but look, I didn't run.  But I ain't running anywhere.  Rick, you're trying to, you know, you're trying to look cool.  No!  Let me tell you something.  No, I'm telling you the truth.  I didn't run.  You took your pumpkin carving so serious, everyone's like, man.  And Lenny goes, well, he's really competitive.  Oh, my God.  Oh, Steve did a great pumpkin.  I'll get her on the phone, because Steve works at Y100 in Philly, by the way.  Steve is doing a really good job, and Rick is getting pissed off. 
[01:15:30]  And I go, what's the deal with Rick?  He hasn't said a word, because they're all around this picnic table carving and chatting.  This is how retards act.  I'm on that card, the punk, and better.  And then you've got to calm him down.  And all of a sudden, Lenny goes, he's really, really competitive.  He's taking this very serious.  Well, I cut my eye out.  I was pissed.  What, did you have a little pupil thing?  Yeah, that came right off.  Oh, that's a bitch.  You know, when you have the eye, Norton, the little...  No, I don't know.  I really don't.  Norton gets pissed off when this show gets faggy. 
[01:16:00]  I don't mind faggy, but just pumpkin carving is disgraceful.  So they're all around the table, and then they put in Hellraiser.  I swear, I've never seen Hellraiser, so I want to check it out.  Pinhead and all that.  You are the biggest pain in the ass when it comes to movies.  Why?  That is why he doesn't like any movies, because...  What is he going, uh...  No, he's sitting there going, uh, what happens next?  What happens next?  Constantly asking, what happens next?  And it's just like...  I'm like, dude, watch the movie.  No, no, I've got to know what happens next.  It's like, no, just watch the movie.  He was always asking. 
[01:16:30]  And then I would walk to the picnic table and tell Stan she's doing a good job,  and then I'd sit back on the couch and continue watching Hellraiser.  Getting into the spirit of...  But I was the only one that didn't carve a pumpkin.  Ah, there you go.  And, uh, I was catching Hell.  Like, what's wrong with you?  Did you take pictures?  Uh, no.  Linda goes...  Linda goes...  I don't know.  There are pictures.  There's pictures.  We can put it up on the website of Rick Carver.  I have no idea.  We will have a picture of your cute little pumpkin all carved out, my friend.  With the jacked-up eye interview. 
[01:17:00]  Right, right.  With the bad eye, and you with the, uh, the crow makeup on.  And, Linda, your wife goes to me, because I've been at a few of these parties,  and then, you know, we share, like, you know, family functions together and stuff.  She goes, I've never seen you do anything fun at these parties.  Ooh.  I'm like, what?  I don't want to carve a pumpkin.  There's nothing fun to do at a pumpkin carving party.  There's nothing fun about it.  I've never been to one, Jim.  I've never been.  Have you?  Perhaps you just don't know the fun of it.  Let's go to Andrew on the national line. 
[01:17:30]  Line nine.  Andrew, what's going on?  How you doing?  Hey, old boy, you were carving up a pumpkin?  And Morton was carving up a baby.  Nice.  Oh, God.  Wow, a despicable human being.  You are a despicable human.  Jim, what's up with that?  I think so, yeah.  So, it's true, but it's despicable.  Anthony, how was no doubt on Friday?  Ha!  Wait, what? 
[01:18:00]  Why all of a sudden you let pumpkin guy?  Rick is laughing at me.  First of all, you tell me Gwen Stefani is hard to look at, and you're the fag.  It was good.  No doubt it's good.  What am I going to say?  Charlotte Church is good to look at, too, but I wouldn't go to one of her shows.  Make a good point there, Madonna guy.  Well, we rehashed this.  I went, it was a good show. 
[01:18:30]  It was Friday, it was a good show.  Tony, the general manager of WBCN up here in Boston, is like, dude, what was up with all  that gay talk Friday?  No, it was just, because some people were trying to say that going to see No Doubt is faggier  for some reason than seeing Madonna.  Madonna is like, you will get half the guys that go to Madonna dressed like Madonna.  I don't even feel like having this argument today.  Oh, I know.  We did it on Friday.  I agree with you.  I think I lost that one.  And I'm saying I enjoyed the show.  I thought it was good.  Can I just clarify something?  You went to see No Doubt, and you two went to a pumpkin carving party while you had on 
[01:19:00]  black lipstick.  This is awful.  Awful.  What did you do, Stinky?  Did you go to confession with Father Ritter?  Well, and then, Rick, they never went to Mulcahy's for the party.  No, never made it.  Never made it.  So that's what you're dressed for.  So you put on all that makeup for nothing.  For nothing.  All right.  Well, there you go.  That's the pumpkin carving party.  Gee, it sounds like a blast. 
[01:19:30]  I wish I was there.  Let's go to Tara on line three.  Tara.  She's having trouble with the phone.  Hey, Tara, what's going on?  How are you?  So, Rick, if you ever break your eye on your pumpkin, take a toothpick, and you can reinsert  it into the pumpkin.  He did that.  And you don't have to use it.  I finally figured that out.  I got the eye back.  Rick, don't yell at that mic.  You're telling everybody out there.  Thank God, because I made Dolly Brown, and I lost his ear, and I used the toothpick, and  I saved it. 
[01:20:00]  And I'm a big, big pumpkin carving.  Isn't that great?  A little pumpkin tip.  You know what you should do next time?  Instead of taking the toothpick, you should take a knife and fall on it.  It was for my kids, Norton.  Get a life.  If you had kids, then you'd have a life.  But I don't.  That's why I blow it in their face, and I kick them out of the car.  Oh, Jesus.  Wow.  Tara, please don't stop listening to us.  You're the only female that listens to us.  No, I listen to you guys every day.  I have three kids.  I'm totally not the norm.  I chase them into the basement. 
[01:20:30]  Cool.  There you go.  That's what I like to do.  All right.  Any other ladies showing up for the Booba Lantern Contest?  Not yet.  No.  We don't have to bet.  No, but it's early, though.  You forget.  It's in Boston again, so 5 o'clock in this traffic and all that stuff.  It's not like New York.  You can just take a cab or take the train or whatever.  All right.  Thank you for that, Nick, but I'm not buying it.  A lot of girls might be coming from Natick.  All right.  How would one make it to Boylston Street from Natick, Jim Norton? 
[01:21:00]  Probably in a vehicle.  It's like, what were you on the train with?  Like one of those Massachusetts, like, atlases just, okay, Worcester, Natick.  Did you see that on Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?  Oh, yeah.  Regis talking to Dennis Leary.  And he goes, so Dennis Leary originally from Worcester.  What an idiot.  Please, someone write this out for me.  How am I supposed to remember everything?  He gets all mad.  He doesn't know anything.  Nothing.  Nothing. 
[01:21:30]  Daniel Leary.  You're here.  What?  No, it's Dennis Leary.  You're doing a benefit for astronauts?  What is that?  No, no.  It's for firefighters.  Regis, do you pay attention to anything?  I'm busy with a show.  Two shows.  I got the Millionaire Show.  I ask these questions of celebrities, and I don't know.  Look, I don't have a clue what the answer is.  Thank God it's written down.  Gelman.  Hey, we should take a break so we can use the foosball table then.  You want to play some more foosball?  Yeah. 
[01:22:00]  They brought it here for the next couple of days.  It's gone Wednesday.  You may as well use it now.  Thanks, guys.  I know.  They just feel at home, they got us a foosball table, so that's pretty cool.  Gelman, my pumpkin eye fell out, and I don't have a toothpick.  Hey, can we play that technical virgin spot?  Yeah.  As we go to break here?  Oh.  That's right.  And we've got to talk about the balloon action.  Yeah, because that seems to be what ladies up here are doing.  Well, the Rolling Stone...  You know what?  I hear you talking about this, but I can tell you outright that is just complete farce. 
[01:22:30]  Really?  Farce.  The guy from Rolling Stone that interviewed us swears it's true that the girls will save  their...  They'll save their virginity, and instead they'll...  They'll give up the back door.  Yeah, they'll do the old rotisserie move and do that action to remain a virgin for the people  they...  For the guy they love and marry and want to give that up to.  Well, Nick is here, and he says it's a bunch of bunk.  There you go.  That's bunk.  One might even go so far as to say malarkey or bilgewater. 
[01:23:00]  They might, you know, they might save the front end, but then when the back end ends  up looking like the Ted Williams Tunnel...  Where's security at Logan?  A big gaping hole.  I remember from my Boston days how much that tunnel stunk, too.  The Ted Williams Tunnel.  Yes.  All right, as we go to break the technical virgin spot, and we'll be back.  We're broadcasting live from Boston. 
[01:23:30]  I've got big plans for my future.  A good college, a career, maybe even my own business someday.  But one thing I'm not planning on is getting pregnant.  That's why I choose anal f***.  I mean, sure, it hurts a little, and I wind up walking funny for a day or two, but I think  my future's worth it.  Anal f***, the smart choice for your future.  Something strange is happening here.  What?  There's something wrong with us.  How do we play what's in my pants? 
[01:24:00]  Something very, very wrong with us.  What's a little contributing to the delinquency of a minor?  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Guess that's in teen pants.  And we're back with The Opie and Anthony Show.  We're broadcasting live from WBCN Studios in Boston, and the party's starting to kick  into overdrive, Anthony.  Yeah, we're having some fun, man.  We got lots of people in the studio.  Yeah.  We got a bunch of freaks outside WBCN Studios right now in costumes and stuff. 
[01:24:30]  What?  We're just kind of hanging out.  We're going to bring some of them in in a little while.  Dressed in costume, huh?  More girls coming down for the boobalantern contest.  Who just left?  Boobalantern.  Ken, what's up?  And in the studio, we got Scott and Ken from The Crystal Method.  What's up?  How you doing?  Yeah, you should see the boobalantern thing, man.  You just missed it.  We got a girl in here.  If girls have implants and you shine flashlights on their boobs, they glow.  I'm coming back for that.  Well, we have more girls coming down, so hopefully you'll luck out. 
[01:25:00]  But you've got to show them a photo, man, of the boobalantern contest.  You got one over there?  Yeah, look at this.  It's sick.  It looks like Mars.  You see that, sir?  And then...  It's like a mammogram, almost.  Some of them brighter than others.  Show them the one that just came in about a half hour ago.  That's the one that just came in.  Look at that.  Excellent.  What's that all about? 
[01:25:30]  Isn't that cool?  Yeah.  Very good.  Poor man's...  I took care of that on my girlfriend.  Does she have implants?  Does she have the implants?  Because you need the implants.  She's the girl on the cover of Tweekend.  Tweekend rocks, by the way.  I was telling them off air, I'm listening to this thing every day in the gym, and it's  just making me run my mollies off.  Cool.  I mean, it's just high energy all the way.  Well, thank you very much.  So, well, these guys met at a radio station in Vegas, Anthony. 
[01:26:00]  Really?  We actually met at a grocery store, but...  Well, we were both working at this grocery store.  But Ken actually used to run the college radio station at the UNLV.  You know what's good about that is, you know the CES show every year, the Consumer Electronics  Show?  Yeah.  Along with that is, like, the porno convention?  Yeah.  Wow.  So, we would invent talk shows just to, like, meet porno stars every year.  Yeah, the porn convention out there every year.  That's great. 
[01:26:30]  So, you went to a few of those?  Oh, yeah, every year.  Yeah.  There's actually two.  The VSDA, which is the video software, whatever, the people that make the video tapes.  That was in, like, June or July, and then Consumer Electronics Show is January, so you  get porno twice a year.  The porno ones are great, though.  It's like, I love when the girls get up there and give their best anal speech.  You know?  Where the hell else are you going to see that?  I'd like to thank God and my father for raping me.  You can talk to some pretty famous porn stars over the years, haven't you, Ken? 
[01:27:00]  I remember I interviewed Tracy Lords when...  Ah, one of the classics.  I guess she was 17, but at the time she was saying she was 21.  You got to interview her when she was still a porn star.  We had to interview her, you know, only...  When she's legit just recently.  Yeah, only a couple months ago, and she didn't want to talk about any of that stuff, really.  Yeah, she's...  We bring up all the questions, and she gave us this look, like, I'm a legitimate actress  now.  You know what?  We've seen that look, and that's after she tried to become, like, a techno DJ.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Then you got that look? 
[01:27:30]  Anything but porno.  Yeah.  God.  You watch those videos, though.  Oh, my God.  Wait, so this is your girlfriend on the cover, really?  Yeah.  Wow, look at that.  Oh, yeah?  Oh, sorry.  Why did you decide to do that?  Actually, she was just down there at the...  Where were we at?  Don't gawk, Opie, let me see.  At the beach.  The chick with the ass, she was actually supposed to be the cover girl, but she didn't have that  sort of California look.  And Lisa, Ken's girlfriend, just looks very nice. 
[01:28:00]  That's very nice.  She's very California.  Worked out really, really well.  When did you hook up with her?  Oh, I met her a few years ago.  Yeah.  No big story.  Not at that porno convention, I hope.  No, no, no.  It's a pretty good story, but I don't want to talk about it.  She's getting that look like Tracy Lawrence got there.  Yeah, look.  You're pulling the Tracy Lawrence on us, man.  It was a few years ago, but we're a couple now and everything's fine.  Should we ask a stupid question? 
[01:28:30]  Like what?  Well, what's the new album all about?  Wait, first of all, let me tell you what I love about Boston.  Go ahead.  San Francisco has 3Com Park and Arizona has Bank One or whatever.  Boston, Dunkin' Donuts Center.  Yeah, you see that?  Hell yes.  I had to ask Nick what the hell is that, and he says it's in Providence, right?  It's the venue formerly known as the Providence Civic Center.  Yeah, for some reason, the corporate sponsorship gets on these stadiums and venues and whatnot. 
[01:29:00]  Just makes it sound ridiculous, yeah.  You too, at the Dunkin' Donuts Center.  Yeah, did they say that?  Catch you too, Metallica, live at the Munchkin Center, just off of the Dunkin' Donuts Center.  A couple stadiums were named after dot-com companies, and they had to change their name because they went out of business.  So what's the Twizzler Arena?  Twizzler Licorice Arena. 
[01:29:30]  It just gets ridiculous, man.  So, Crystal Method, The Crystal Method.  That's right.  Tell us about the new album.  A new album, Twizzle Weekend.  New single.  It's called You Know It's Hard, formerly Murder.  It's got Scott Weiland doing vocals on it.  How was it working with him?  I don't know.  We still haven't seen him.  Last time we talked to Scott was, I think, about four years ago at a radio show in the Midwest. 
[01:30:00]  And we were hoping to hook up, but he was in lockdown.  When we went to go mix, murder, or You Know It's Hard, they were in the middle of doing the Stone Temple Pilots record.  So he was not allowed out of the building.  So he did his part, you did your part?  It's kind of the point where you're just emailing parts to each other and laying down stuff, and people don't even meet each other anymore.  You know what?  Just on this one track, it was like the Tom Morello stuff. 
[01:30:30]  He was in the studio.  We were working together and everything.  And actually, Scott, though, was great about it.  He did his work fast and did it well, and everything was really cool.  Afterwards, I started thinking, you know what?  Him all in rehab and stuff and us being called the Crystal Method.  Maybe it was a great to come over.  Yeah.  You ever do any of that crystal meth?  Wow, that stuff would kick your ass, huh?  That was bad.  He's giving me that look again, the Tracy Lord's look.  Like, let's not go there.  We saw Rick James. 
[01:31:00]  We were at this in Vegas over the weekend.  We were doing this sports music festival for MTV yesterday.  But on Friday, we were doing all these radio interviews.  And we just happened to be the greatest part was Rick James was doing the rounds.  Rick James.  Oh, my God.  What is he up to?  Oh, my God, man.  Learning bitches with crack fighters.  And we were leaving, and Rick James was sitting over into the restrooms in this big chair with his ladies.  Looking like a king pimp.  Yeah.  Really?  And so we went over to take a picture with him. 
[01:31:30]  And we went to somebody that we were walking over with.  He goes, hey, Rick, Rick, this is the Crystal Method.  He goes, uh, the Crystal what, man?  What are you saying?  Oh, yeah, I'll take it.  I mean, what?  His eyes were like Crystal Method, man.  And then he burnt the Rheingold logo on your arm with a glass pipe.  Boy, that's a partying son of a bitch, him, man.  Oh, my God.  When he passes, Rick James, known for burning his girlfriend and his slave mistress with a crack pipe. 
[01:32:00]  And that super freak track.  That was all the stuff that didn't make it into the behind the music about how he allegedly tied his girlfriend to a chair and made another girl go.  Yeah, it was all crazy.  That's the stuff you want to watch some girl.  He would frequently kidnap.  Yeah.  Frequently kidnapped.  No.  He would pick him up.  O.J. calls him crazy.  And then he would, like, just keep him there.  Keep him imprisoned with crack and ropes and stuff for a while.  And it's like, Rick James is doing this? 
[01:32:30]  Who the hell knew?  Goddamn Hammer stole my song.  Why don't we check out the latest single from The Crystal Method, man?  We could do that.  You know it's hard from Tweekend.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  The latest from The Crystal Method.  You know it's hard with Scott Weiland on vocals, Anthony.  Yeah.  Loving that song.  Loving the album, Tweekend, by The Crystal Method.  And they're playing the Halloween party tonight at Avalon.  Live at the Yodel Center. 
[01:33:00]  After we do the radio show, we're all heading down to Lansdowne Street for the big party tonight.  And if you need tickets for the Grave Rave, stop by the WBCN Studios, 1265 Boylston Street.  There's a little crowd hanging outside, just partying, really.  Hanging out?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And we're giving them tickets to the show tonight.  So I'm going to have to go back to the hotel and get my costume before I go over there, Opie.  Will you guys be wearing costumes tonight?  We've been talking about that.  We're, yeah, we're working on something.  I think we were talking about just getting a couple cheap little, like, kiddie robot masks 
[01:33:30]  and going out as Daft Punk.  A Daft Punk reference.  Chemical Brothers.  Yeah, we actually thought about that, too.  The costumes will suck, guaranteed, no matter what they are.  You guys like dressing up for Halloween?  Do you do it?  Do you get forced to do it?  Well, we've had two great costumes.  Well, one year we were Racer X and Speed Racer.  That's for life.  Speed Racer and he was Racer X.  I got that picture.  That's a good one. 
[01:34:00]  Now, next year.  If this chick asked him to dress up, he dresses up.  No, this is what I was going to do.  The costume I want to do is I want to go as Larry Flint and have my girlfriend push me  around in the wheelchair.  Jim, he's your best friend now, right?  That's the greatest.  That's the greatest.  It's going to be so awesome because he's shit the whole night.  That was an easy, easy costume.  The winner, though, for Ken was the year he went as Michael Jackson. 
[01:34:30]  And he had to get white makeup to get him as white as me.  The little paler.  But the killer was the outfit and the glove and everything.  But we found this Macaulay Culkin doll from the Home Alone.  Oh, my God.  And he zipped him up.  His head was coming out of his pants.  And then he pulled the string and he goes,  Hey, we can party with you guys.  It's all right, man.  That's not funny.  You guys like carving pumpkins?  Shut up. 
[01:35:00]  I didn't carve a pumpkin, man.  Opie and Rick had to go to a pumpkin party party.  We heard about that.  Who was the crow?  Who was the crow?  The crow.  Right there.  Mr. Crow with the black lipstick and stuff.  A lot of people, you know, they said,  Oh, no surprise there.  Rick, wear makeup again.  You guys worked with Richard Patrick, is it?  Yeah, we like to call him Richie.  Yeah, yeah.  Richie from Filter.  He doesn't like the Patrick name because, of course, his brother, you know. 
[01:35:30]  He doesn't like Richie.  He doesn't like Patrick.  He does like alcohol, though, doesn't he?  Oh, my God.  He is awesome.  He's a great guy.  We were on Family Values tour with him.  And he's a fun guy.  We were, what, backstage at the River Rave.  Yeah, at the River Rave.  And he had a girl going around with him the whole time that was just going,  No vodka.  No vodka.  Like, behind him.  He'd be going, Hey, where are you going to get a drink around here?  And she's just doing the whole putting the kibosh thing on everything.  Like, no, no, she's a mine behind him. 
[01:36:00]  No.  When Filter was on Family Values and they came to L.A.,  Scott and I were just, we went to the show.  We were walking backstage just to say hi to him, you know.  And, you know, their manager, who was our manager,  kind of, like, cuts us off.  I'm like, No vodka.  Yeah.  None.  I don't want to drink.  I swear to God, it's hysterical.  He, like, ran up to me backstage at the River Rave.  And he had, like, a, he, like, put his hand up for me to slap him five.  And I'm like, What's going on?  Meantime, Godsmack's playing Keep Away.  He's going, I'm going to sue these guys. 
[01:36:30]  I'm going to sue them right now.  Because, like, Keep Away is, like, the exact same baseline.  Oh, that's right.  He doesn't like Godsmack.  So he's, like, slapping my hand going, I'm going to sue them.  I'm like, Rock on.  Have another drink, Richie.  Yeah, the guy.  Boy, he knows how to party.  He had a good time.  But it was weird.  It was like a Jekyll and Hyde thing, you know?  He's an all or nothing guy.  Yeah, because I talked to him before.  All the way or not.  Before the set.  And he was fine.  Everything was great.  And I see him backstage.  I'm walking up.  I'm like, Hey, Rich, what's up, man? 
[01:37:00]  So busy, Godsmack, man.  Rip it up.  We're like, Whoa, hey.  And, actually, we just talked to him recently.  And he's actually doing, I think he's been sober for quite some time.  And his new record sounds amazing.  I can't wait to hear it.  Wow.  You take the good with the best.  You're so full of crap.  What?  What did you do?  Why is he shaking his head over there as you say that?  He doesn't know.  He's trying to get a reaction from you guys.  And I hear he's starring in the X-Files.  Oh, wait a minute.  Hey, I've got my own moderation issues. 
[01:37:30]  Yeah, I noticed, man.  Those beers went down really quick.  Yeah, save some for us, will you?  We only have 100.  We only have a tub full.  I think I'd like to party.  That's cool.  I like that.  You grew up in Vegas, you know.  No one tells you to go home.  Yeah, what the hell is that like?  Like, grew up when you were kids, you were in Vegas?  Yeah.  Really?  No one says the bar's closed, ever.  You know what I would love about Vegas, especially growing up? 
[01:38:00]  When you reach the age where you want to get laid, you could buy it.  And in Vegas, think about it, though.  Well, it's legally.  Yeah.  When you reach the age where you want to get laid, you can't drive.  You can drive a car, though.  That's it.  But it's not.  See, I'd walk.  Whenever it took me.  You don't want to walk to the...  It's a good man, though.  Las Vegas is in Clark County, and it's not legal in Clark County.  Yeah, but it's close enough.  Yeah, I guess.  Right?  All you've got to do is go down to the Strip or downtown and get those guys to hand out the leaflets. 
[01:38:30]  Well, you could go to the Crack Whores in New York, too, but, you know...  I like my prostitution being regulated for some reason.  I kind of like that idea.  Yeah, you know, you've got to play because in Las Vegas, we're just there.  We don't...  We're not there that much, but more and more, it seems like the call girl business there  is as mainstream as gambling and casinos.  As everything else?  Well, Vegas has become very mainstream.  They're on all the billboards, on top of all the taxis, as girls directly to your room. 
[01:39:00]  Really?  They'll call you a price just to come over.  He's the expert.  I'll use an expert on them.  He's the expert in cities where they haven't heard of prostitution.  They won't give you a full service price over the phone.  They'll say, like, oh, $150.  But that's just to give you a little dance, and they want more.  They want more money.  This guy is an expert.  You're in Vegas a lot with Dice.  He tours with Dice, and Dice plays Vegas a lot.  Now, you've had to have had girls come to your room.  What's the most you've paid?  The most I've ever spent.  There was one time I received yellow discipline, and that was $200. 
[01:39:30]  Yellow discipline.  That's a true story.  Some of the bitter galliano.  $300 is the most.  $300 is as high as I was.  So, Anthony, he's such an expert.  When we went to Philly to do the radio show, he knew where all the people were.  You know the garden spots where you could pick up hookers?  Yeah, I don't really drive around in those parts.  You've got to be careful driving around.  Like you said, Clark County, man, they're known for really being ball busters about certain things.  You can't get arrested in Vegas. 
[01:40:00]  It's a bad jail system.  You don't want to be that guy in the car going, I was just driving through.  Yeah, you don't want to get arrested in Vegas.  In Vegas, though, there are no girls walking on the street.  None.  They eliminated it, I don't know, like 20, 15 years ago.  And ever since this one sheriff got rid of it, it doesn't exist.  That's it, huh?  Not streetwalkers.  Everything else.  Can't you find them a little down by the stratosphere?  Like that's where they sell drugs?  No, I never did it, but I've heard it.  Of course you never did, but you've heard it.  They call that area Heroin Heights. 
[01:40:30]  I think maybe so.  Maybe so.  Heroin Heights.  That's where you want to get your car.  I never saw that in the Vegas brochures, Heroin Heights.  Dude, it is actually the type of...  I got a girl one time, this is absolutely true,  and New Brunswick gave me a Hummer for $7 and two cigarettes.  Oh, my God.  $7 and two cigarettes.  Let me let you in on a secret.  That wasn't a girl.  Well, he was phenomenal.  Good night.  Thanks for tuning in here.  Talk to you tomorrow at 3. 
[01:41:00]  Oh, my God.  Let's go to the phones and talk to Bob on the national line online.  We got the crystal method in the studio.  Bob, what's going on, man?  Dude, you have to ask these guys about...  Apparently, they were arrested a year and a half ago or two years ago  in either an e-lab or a meth lab somewhere out in Nevada,  and I know they got out of it somehow,  but there's got to be some kind of story.  I love these stories.  I love these stories.  They surface every once in a while.  We were arrested.  What's great about our arrest is the interpretations of the... 
[01:41:30]  The story gets better and better all the time.  Yeah, we were arrested.  We heard it was in Australia, Mexico.  Yeah, we were in a prison somewhere...  It's an urban legend now.  Yeah, it really is.  I heard you walked in on him, and he had peanut butter smeared all over him,  and the dog was there, and everyone else was surprised.  They couldn't get the horse out of the building.  I don't know.  It's awful.  That was great.  What's the real story?  Yeah, we were arrested.  We were at a friend's house, and everyone at the house got arrested. 
[01:42:00]  Another city you do not want to get arrested in is Los Angeles.  Oh, yeah, LA, sure.  And, you know, all they're going for is the 11 o'clock news.  Oh, drug lab busted in downtown, 18 arrested.  And then everybody sits back in their lounge chair at home while they're eating dinner.  Oh, wow.  We're much safer now because these people were arrested.  But two years...  Nobody knew. 
[01:42:30]  We didn't bring up our band name.  Are you kidding me?  Hey, this was in 97.  This happened in 97, and it just happened right after our record came out.  So a lot of people thought that we did this on purpose,  that we set ourselves up to get arrested.  Because, like, on MTV, they were like, of course, the method was arrested in Los Angeles.  What's your occupation, a musician?  What kind of music do you play?  Country, West.  All kinds.  Country and West.  Both kinds.  So it was a... 
[01:43:00]  So you got busted for being in a house where something was going on?  Yeah, it was a full-on raid.  And it was a friend of ours' house who...  Some friend.  Two years.  No, it wasn't...  It's like the friend that tells you the kilo of coke has been under your pass.  It was the rollover thing.  The rollover, get caught, get out, turn over three, get out for free.  It was part of that.  So this guy, who he was a friend with, he just threw that name out.  His name out.  Well, two years later, after all the legal battles and everything,  after spending like $50,000 on the lawyer, 
[01:43:30]  finally the judge just said, this is dismissed, and threw it out.  But, I mean, that was two years later,  and nobody ever heard about the tail end of that story.  You ever talk to the guy who's housing around?  And just...  Oh, yeah, we're still playing with it.  It wasn't E or meth.  It was G.  That was GHB.  It was G-H-B.  But if you're a kicker for the Oakland Raiders,  you have no problems with the authorities, I guess, with GHB.  Hey, so what is that guy, Janikowski?  He's a toll maker. 
[01:44:00]  Weekend is awesome.  Thank you, sir.  Where are you calling from?  I'm in Jersey in my car.  Oh, very cool.  All right, thanks, Bob.  Peace.  Let's go to line one on the National and talk to Jay.  We got the crystal method in the studio, Scott and Ken.  It's great how it gets blown out of proportion, though.  Jay, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, ONA?  Hey.  Hey, I just wanted to say,  I just know why they got the name, the crystal method.  Because you have to be on it to enjoy it.  That thing was gay.  Gay?  That was so gay. 
[01:44:30]  That was like techno.  That was like really gay.  We're out of the closet now.  I like that song.  It seemed too gay.  It was cool.  It was like a techno theme.  The guy seems real cool and everything.  I like the way you took the conversation one way,  and then you kind of threw in a little punchline there.  You caught everyone off guard.  You like that noise.  It was nice.  Jay, I bet you listened to the whole thing, though, didn't you?  Yeah, I did, actually.  It was gay, though.  I mean, I had to.  Well, then, let's all be gay together. 
[01:45:00]  The word gay gets thrown around too much, man.  Yeah.  It's not gay music.  Let's leave it to the suckers, okay?  Leave the word where it belongs with the men that are other men's right.  All right, Jay.  Thanks.  All right.  No way to rule.  Okay.  We're going to take a break.  You guys can hang for a while, right?  Right.  Hopefully, we'll get another girl in here to do the boob-a-lantern thing.  Hopefully, we got enough beer.  Nothing.  Jesus Christ.  I know, man.  You know what we should do is invite some of the freaks outside the studio. 
[01:45:30]  Oh, you want to meet some of these people?  You guys fearful of any fans or anything?  No, we saw one wild one out there.  Yeah?  Let's play some more gay crystal methadone music.  Hey, man, I'll say it.  Tweekend rocks.  Hell yeah, man.  I like it a lot.  I say this, though.  I've got to say this seriously in their defense, because everyone's why you get that.  You don't have to defend these guys.  There's going to be guys out there no matter what you do.  If you're like a three-chord rock guy, it's like if you're not really feeling the techno thing,  crystal methadone, that's hard beats, man.  And, you know, it's good stuff.  No joke.  Yeah, they're great.  Who cares if they're gay? 
[01:46:00]  What's the difference?  He really knows.  From last night when we were in bed together, he was just...  I mean, what does he call Ricky Martin?  If he's calling us gay, I mean, I don't know what...  I mean, that's...  Call us back.  All right.  We'll take a quick break, and we'll be back with Scott and Ken from The Crystal Method.  Hi, we're here.  We're here under your skin.  Us two, A-Hole.  Hello!  Opie and Anthony. 
[01:46:30]  Anthony, WWF Raw.  Yes, tonight, live from the Tampon Arena.  No, it's...  WWF Raw.  The smack heard around the world.  That wussy Shane McMahon and his man-eater of a sister.  What is that?  Stephanie stooped to an all-new low last Thursday when they assaulted their mother, Linda.  As Shane held his mother, evil sister, Stephanie bitch-slapped Linda, leaving her physically and emotionally battered.  Now, WWF owner Vince McMahon is looking to avenge his wife, his company, and his honor by annihilating his son in a street fight tonight on Raw. 
[01:47:00]  Anything goes here.  No rules, no time limit.  Pipes, chairs, wrenches, you name it.  They're going to beat the crap out of each other, and it's all legal.  And as Vince takes care of Family Matters, Stone Cold Steve Austin tries to rally the Alliance back from losing four of their prized title belts.  Can the Alliance regain their dominance?  Somehow I think of the Alliance as being something else a little more important.  Just check out WWF Raw tonight, live, 9 p.m. Eastern, 8 Central, only on the new TNN. 
[01:47:30]  Opie and Anthony.  1-0-2-7.  W-N-E-W.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  A little taste of the crystal method.  Busy child.  We got Scott and Ken in the studio, Anthony.  They're playing Avalon tonight.  Having fun, man.  You know, I am looking at you guys a little differently now that I know that I'm gay.  No, he didn't say you were gay.  He said you're music.  He said you're cool.  Don't worry about that. 
[01:48:00]  I don't even know what he meant.  Whatever.  The grave rave is tonight.  A lot of people want tickets for the show.  People are starting to show up at the station here, Anthony.  1265 Boylston Street.  There's a little party going on outside the station today.  I took a stroll out the front door and I checked it out.  There's guys playing in traffic with big wow signs.  Guys coming by with Halloween costumes.  Notice I'm saying guys a lot.  Not many women coming by for some reason.  Well, yeah, that seems to happen with this show.  But we have, you know, it's a sausage fest around here.  Ladies, come on down, baby. 
[01:48:30]  See?  Now you guys get on and say that.  You know what?  It's because there's no strip clubs in Boston.  If you come down now, you might be able to make another Crystal Method guest list for tonight's show.  I'm supposed to turn the guest list in when we get to the venue.  And we have a few more minutes here, so come on down.  And only one lady has shown up for the Booba Lantern Contest.  Really?  That's it so far.  Maybe we'll do better tomorrow when we broadcast live from PCN.  How do the girls like you?  You know, you get a lot of big female following there. 
[01:49:00]  Check out the cover of the record.  I'm actually married, happily married.  I've been married for quite some time.  What's his name?  Playing off the joke.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's stupid.  How was your trip back from Vermont?  We're now married, huh?  Yeah, we actually, the one thing that happens a lot is we get our music.  You always get, like, we just recently in Vegas, we, oh, I love dancing to your song. 
[01:49:30]  Or you get all, you get the, you know, the can.  I've climbed many a pole to your music.  Yeah, this is great.  That's what we got from Devin Lane.  Yo, how about that?  You know how many guys have been in bands and stuff, and the dream is to go into a strip club  and watch a girl take her clothes off and climb that pole to your music.  Yeah.  You know, that's got to be great.  Yeah, we do good in strip clubs.  I'll tell you, the champion, though, is like during, uh, during, uh, 90's Nails heyday. 
[01:50:00]  Yeah.  It was like every other song at a strip club.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Well, yeah, it goes through phases.  It was, uh...  Unless you're in the South, though.  Then it's all, it's still, like, 38 Special.  Still hairband.  38 Special, yeah.  Yeah, I was going to say, look, this, these same girls said it.  Motley Crue is still, you know, you're going, girls, girls, girls.  These same girls said it to Bob Seger, though, when they met him.  We've got tonight.  Oh, that was, that was one that I always, it sticks in my mind because it was the old, uh,  rug act, which you don't see a lot anymore. 
[01:50:30]  I wish they'd bring that back.  There's a Bob Seger song about a stripper.  I think it's, uh, down on Main Street, or, uh...  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  There was one, though, where, where I went to the local strip club down there on, uh, Long  Island in New York, and this girl would have, like, a bedspread.  Looked like she took it when she ran away from her abusive father.  And she'd flip it out on the floor, and then this was when they used to get down for a  whole song.  They would be on the floor, on this bedspread with various oils and whatnot, and flipping 
[01:51:00]  their legs around and giving the best view to whoever threw the most money.  And all I remember is, we got tonight, who needs tomorrow, let's make it last, you know,  and there she is just going to town, and I'm just, this is the best song ever.  Yeah, they don't have to work as hard now.  They need to bring that back and have her do it on, like, a glass floor, and then charge  admission for hanging out below.  You're a genius.  Let's do it.  Why didn't anyone think of that?  That's a great idea.  The glass bottom strip club.  Glass bottom stays.  Yes.  If they could have showers and strip clubs, they could have... 
[01:51:30]  And imagine what you paid them.  They could just put the money in those little, those little things you get at banks, and  it would send them...  Yeah.  It would go to the tubes, and the view from down below just looks like a...  You ever get the sucker fish in your aquarium?  Come on, right?  Just like it, Morgan.  You know what I'm talking about.  Yeah.  Hopefully she ain't Mexican.  You're a mess.  You are a mess, my friend.  Hey, let's get these Devo guys in here.  All right.  I saw these guys out front.  Just a few of the freaks hanging outside the station today.  They dressed up. 
[01:52:00]  I guess they're going tonight.  Yeah.  And it's going to be a costume contest they hear tonight.  Look at this guy.  We have enough chicks, though.  We need more chicks.  Yeah, absolutely.  Come on, now.  You're going to see some girls tonight, I'm sure.  Hey, guys.  What's up, guys?  We're running on a microphone.  Give him that mic for a second.  Well, this guy's Devo.  How you doing, fellas?  Boston?  What's up?  What's up?  I like the whole retro thing there.  Devo, you don't see it much anymore.  A lot of people dressing as Devo back in the 80s.  You know?  Yeah.  A lot of the young kids nowadays don't even know who Devo is. 
[01:52:30]  They just think we look like, you know, a couple of idiots.  I think they probably think you're...  No.  I wasn't thinking that.  Looks like you should be opening up some mail somewhere.  That's your anthrax patrol.  That's what I'm putting in the anthrax.  Yeah.  Now, what's up with the bullhorn?  You want to give us a little sample?  To make a little noise.  You guys want to hear it?  That works.  And they dumped out because you used the wrong word. 
[01:53:00]  Yeah, I'll bring them right in.  Warning, warning.  That's great.  So what do you do?  Rape them while they're holding their ears?  What?  Always like that.  Where are you guys from?  We're from a town called Halberts, South Shore.  Oh, yeah.  Sure, we know it.  We know it from our Boston days.  Baird and Maguire, the chemical waste dump.  Right.  It's the least of our problems these days.  Chemical waste.  I look back in fondness on chemical waste. 
[01:53:30]  Now it's disease.  Great.  Wonderful.  Well, you look like Devo, I'm going to say.  I like that.  Not so much.  You look like you're ready to just go down and do some electrical work underneath the street.  Looks like you just came from the big dig, Anthony.  Fresh from the big dig.  Yeah, that's what you look like.  Fresh from the big dig.  You didn't really put much effort into looking like Devo.  No, he's at least got the wacky hat thing going on.  The wacky Devo hat.  You got the construction hat on.  Construction helmet. 
[01:54:00]  You're like a village people Devo thing.  With the construction work.  Village people.  Is there a Devo guy outside with the Indian headdress on?  You know what's interesting about the Devo guy's hat is he looks like he put a lot of work  into that.  Originally, the Devo hat was just an upside down pot.  Is that what it is?  What is that?  You want the Tupperware ball with an ashtray on it.  Yeah, what is your hat?  I see like a four-wheel drive walking hub from a 73 Ford.  The Devo hat.  What did you actually call it?  What is he got up there?  What is he got up there?  Plasma energy domes.  Uh-oh, is that it?  I know.  It's Devo fan. 
[01:54:30]  Plasma energy domes.  Nick, that could be the saddest thing you've ever told me.  I didn't know that.  But hey, what?  What?  What?  I'm gayer because I like Devo.  He's carving pumpkin.  I think he carved pumpkin.  Rick carved the pumpkin.  I coached my girlfriend.  What is your Devo hat made out of, sir?  It's actually made out of a Tupperware ball.  It is Tupperware.  With an ashtray taped to the top and then spray-painted red.  Spray-painted red for that Devo look. 
[01:55:00]  Yep.  That's good.  What did you call it?  The plasma energy dome.  Plasma energy dome.  That's what it is.  Of course.  Whip it.  Whip it good.  Very good.  Nice.  Alexia, what's with the duct tape pocket?  This suit was set on fire a couple of weeks ago.  These suits come in handy.  We use these for stunts and various stuff.  It was my suit.  What do you mean, stunts?  Lenny was wearing it.  My buddy Lenny over here.  And we lit a pack of sparklers off in the pocket to see if the suit would burn. 
[01:55:30]  Right.  And it went right up.  Blame-proof.  100% flame-proof.  Flame-proof.  Not just flame-ri-taten.  Yeah, what makes this story even better is the Boston accent.  I got you.  The sparklers in the pocket.  Who the hell let these guys in the building?  That's what I want to know.  They were checked so much.  What kind of security did you go through out front?  If Logan had this security, nothing ever would have happened.  I'd mark my words. 
[01:56:00]  You almost froze my eye.  Yeah.  Very close.  Using the vernacular.  That was my request.  This is it.  This is syndication.  No chicks in sight and retards setting themselves on fire.  Thank you.  ONA.  I like the Devo guys.  Yeah, Devo guys are cool.  You're going tonight, right?  Oh, you're damn right.  You know it.  All right.  Well, we'll see you there, guys.  All right.  Bravo.  Huh?  Well, wear the suits.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  We wouldn't have it any other way.  You've got to show up forever.  We might have to bring you up on stage.  Yeah, bring us up on stage.  The VIP room. 
[01:56:30]  A free round of beers.  Whatever.  Sparklers.  Sparklers.  And beers.  You guys, hey, where's the wiffle ball bat challenge?  Unfortunately, that's left back in New York for our road trips.  You don't take something that valuable out on the road with you.  We do the wiffle ball bat challenge.  And look around the room.  Who's going to do it?  Yeah, we can't have people here.  Yikes.  Without pointing at various air personalities' girlfriends.  Right.  Who is it?  There you go. 
[01:57:00]  All right.  Listen.  We've got to go to line three in New York.  Let's go to line three in New York.  Claims to be Scott from STP.  Let's go, ladies.  Oh, yeah.  Hello, hello, hello.  Hello.  Move the phone.  Hello.  Hello.  Who are you?  It's Scott.  Scott who?  I just want to say you guys suck.  Scott thinks we suck.  We're going to be in Philly again, Philly. 
[01:57:30]  We're working on it.  Hey, Philly, Philly, it's not about you all the time, Philly, okay?  Yeah, it is.  You, Tim Sabian, WYSP, it's not always about you.  Philly, a little jealous that we're hanging with our Boston girlfriend.  We just gave Philly a nice tool in the other weekend.  We laid it down and effed her real good.  Now we're up with our chick in Boston.  Sure.  And you've got to deal with it.  All right, Nick.  It doesn't work like that, man.  All right, we're going to let you go. 
[01:58:00]  We're going to let you go.  We're going to be in Philly soon.  We've got to get Scott and Ken out of here because they've got to get ready for the show tonight.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  We're looking forward to it, man.  Grave rave.  Hell yeah.  The grave rave.  Not at the Dunkin' Donuts Center.  Come on.  At the Legs Pantyhose Center.  The Dully Medicine Arena.  More women need to come down to the station here.  What's the address here?  One more time.  1265 Boylston Street.  We have a lot of beautiful women.  There goes Devo.  There goes Devo.  Devo!  Let me tell you something. 
[01:58:30]  Guys, you will see girls tonight.  Yeah, there's going to be a lot of ladies in.  You will see ladies tonight, and it's because of you guys, not because of the opening.  All right.  There he goes.  That's the sound I don't want to hear ever.  Nothing worse than you're driving.  I want to do a flashback to that bus that we had in L.A. a few years ago.  Nothing worse than driving, and they only give you that little whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop.  All over.  Oh, damn it.  All right.  We have a couple more lunatics that we've got to say hi to before we let the crystal meth and leave the studio. 
[01:59:00]  Who are you guys?  Kevin.  Kevin.  Jerry.  And Jerry, where are you guys from?  Weymouth.  Beverly.  Weymouth.  Don't say that word on the air.  I mean, I would love to hear it.  The top one?  Yeah, they'll dump out of that, but it's a great sign.  These guys are playing in traffic outside WBCN, right on Boylston Street, trying to get girls to wow and stuff.  Dante from Clerks.  Yeah.  Yes, Dante from Clerks.  Wasn't even supposed to be here today.  This is my second effort to try to get girls to wow in Boston.  I planted the seed.  I had a wow sticker in downtown Crossing. 
[01:59:30]  Very, very busy day.  A couple of looks, a couple of smiles, a couple of giggles, but no takers.  No ladies.  No takers.  Wait a minute.  Wait, wait, wait.  I went to Newbury Street.  Very busy.  Very nice girls.  Very nice.  Nice.  Nice.  Nice.  And, again, smiles, giggles, but I think a seed will be planted.  It is planted.  Wait, wait, wait.  No ladies are wowing outside the studio?  We'll take care of that.  Ladies, drive by WBCN, 1265 Boylston Street. 
[02:00:00]  These two clowns are playing in traffic and they want to see something.  How could those signs not work?  Boov Inspection Point and T's Checkpoint.  Who would not want to wow me?  I'm a damn good looking guy.  Well, you know something?  I've got to tell you.  With all that's happened in this country since September 11th, people might actually think  there's a boob inspection checkpoint.  Checkpoint's a very current word to use now.  You might want to cross out checkpoint.  Yeah.  That might be scaring off the ladies.  Just go with boob inspection.  I see checkpoint.  I turn around.  Believe me.  Or put something a little more subtle, like show them to me or I'll cut your throat. 
[02:00:30]  Listen to you, Norton.  Sell them up.  Norton talking to us about subtle.  Very good.  Very good.  I mean, we'll get some girls to go out front.  No, we will.  Or we're going to be pathetic.  So ladies, drive by WBCN 1265 Boston Street and show these guys something, okay?  There's a little party going on out on the sidewalk, right?  Unfortunately, I will not be able to attend.  You've got to go?  I do not have ID.  You're not 21?  I am 21.  You look way over 21. 
[02:01:00]  What the hell happened?  How do you lose your ID?  Ladies, there's a couple winners down here.  It's the guy without ID and the boob inspection checkpoints.  Get in line.  We're taking pictures of all this, and you can check them out on opieandanthony.com so you  can play along at home.  But ladies, come by the station and flash these poor guys.  Yeah, come on.  And we're giving out the Grave Rave tickets.  We still have more to give away right out front.  All right?  How about the new Crystal Meth CD?  Nice, right?  Tweak in?  Oh, you want a copy?  You know, we would love to give you one, but Oedipus took them all, and he's selling 
[02:01:30]  them.  Thank you very much.  Out of the secret room.  Where is the secret room?  Damn it.  I want to see it.  You'll never know.  You'll never know.  We're trying to figure it out ourselves.  He will give you a free Crystal Methad CD if you show him your boobs, right?  My boobs?  They're kind of hairy.  I'm talking to the chicks.  I'm talking to the chicks.  I'm talking to the chicks.  I'm talking to the chicks.  You're going to give away the...  Oh, forget it.  Guys, did Oedipus, the PD here at BCN, ask you for 12 Crystal Methad CDs to sell at the  various locations?  No?  Well, he'll get you, believe me. 
[02:02:00]  Rodney always gets all that.  Oh, is that what it is?  There we go.  There we go.  Woo!  Rodney, here we got another Crystal Methad CD.  Lovely.  There you go.  All right.  We've got to take a break.  So, guys, thanks for coming by.  We'll see you tonight, man.  And, of course, Scott and Ken from the Crystal Methad, thanks for coming by.  Thanks, Bob.  Thank you.  The new album, Tweekend, really is good.  I'm loving it.  And they'll be playing Avalon tonight, okay?  And stop by the station for great, brave tickets, wow stickers, wow t-shirts.  We have a little party going on out front.  And we'll continue next. 
[02:02:30]  Stay there.  The award-winning Opie and Anthony show.  This has got to be a joke, people.  Hey, geeky, geeky.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  We're on the road.  We're live in Boston.  Broadcasting from the WBCN studios, the legendary WBCN studios.  Oh, yeah.  I want to thank the Crystal Methad for stopping by. 
[02:03:00]  They're fun guys, man.  Those guys were cool.  Really cool.  It's going to be a pisser tonight.  And we have a party going on outside this place right now.  Outside, too?  Oh, what?  It looks like the movie Airheads outside.  I know, yeah.  There's about 100 guys and, like, two girls.  Yeah.  Well, thank God there's a couple of girls because they're starting to wow now.  Yeah, we put out the word that there's two guys playing in traffic with signs and stuff.  They're trying to get some girls to wow. 
[02:03:30]  They really are.  Did you?  Oh, I know.  They're darting in and out of cars and stuff.  We're on Boylston Street, 1265.  Ladies, drive by and take care of the guys outside the WBCN studios, okay?  They'll love you for it.  They definitely will love you for it.  And if you still want great, great tickets for doing that, we'll give you a pair, okay?  The girl came up and wanted me to sign her shirt, you know?  So I'm like, yeah, okay.  Got to share with the crowd, though.  Yeah.  Got to turn around on the stairs and kind of show everyone.  So she showed, and they just went crazy.  Yeah.  Nice.  I think she's around here now.  Yeah, where is she? 
[02:04:00]  They brought her in.  Steve has taken a lot of pictures of our little trip to Boston, and a lot of those pictures  are up on opianthony.com.  So you can kind of play along at home.  You got pictures of the guys losing it outside and stuff.  Our little trip to Boston.  It makes it sound like we're getting on the short bus to go to Faneuil Hall.  Well, you see this crowd?  We should have a short bus.  If those two lunatics don't get arrested, I'm going to be amazed.  They are stopping cars at some point.  They're hitting the button on the thing going boop, boop, boop.  That guy's singing Devo tunes.  The guy with the bullhorn is singing Devo tunes into the bullhorn. 
[02:04:30]  Those two guys have their signs in traffic stopping cars dead to get these girls to...  Oh, there you go.  They got to see boobs.  They're like, it looks like Frogger out there.  They're just like dark.  They got to see boobs.  Where's this girl?  She wants to flash us real fast, and we'll take a picture, and we'll put it up on opianthony.com.  I saw her moseying around.  Maybe she's playing foosball.  Anthony, we haven't played foosball.  We're so busy.  I know.  You know, during the commercials, we like playing a little foosball, but not today.  Hey, how you doing? 
[02:05:00]  Good.  What's your name?  You look like the chick from the Blind Faith cover, All Grown Up.  The Blind Faith cover.  Wow.  Is that a good obscure reference for today?  Oh, you can't get much more.  Okay.  What's your name?  No, I'm going to say it's another case of Stinky Sister.  Yeah, it looks like Stinky.  Just a smile.  Just a smile.  It's Bonnie.  And where are you from?  I'm from Jersey, but I go to school in Boston.  Jersey?  Oh, there you go.  I've listened to you guys for a while.  You go to school in Boston. 
[02:05:30]  Are you saving the front in lieu of the back?  No.  Unfortunately, I have no takers for either.  Yes, you do.  Oh, my God.  Wait a minute.  God, if that wasn't a setup for Norton.  Norton just pulled out his mule.  You have no takers for either.  No.  Front, but what about the face?  I'm just saying, you know, sometimes the guy will do that.  But Norton, what do you think of Bonnie?  I think Bonnie's very attractive.  She's very nice and she's very sexy. 
[02:06:00]  I bet she's got a fiery red pad.  Do you?  Lovely, yeah.  You got that going down there, right?  Sure you do.  Bonnie, what do you think of Jim Norton?  Actually, I think he's kind of sexy.  Oh, it's so done.  I like that.  Wow.  That eyesight.  And you're in luck.  He likes the balloon knife.  Yeah.  And Bonnie, how old are you?  I'm 19.  Teen?  Yeah.  I'm legal.  If I'd have met you 10 years ago.  What a despicable man. 
[02:06:30]  That gets the belt.  You are a disgusting man.  It doesn't because the timing was perfect on Ella.  Oh, my God.  You are awful, Norton.  Norton, would you like to see Bonnie's boobs?  She's been flashing everyone outside.  And she's licking a lollipop and everything.  You got to respect that.  Yeah, of course.  That's kind of cool, right?  Yeah, she is very, very lovely.  Why don't we take Bonnie's coat away from her so she has two free hands.  And she is wearing a little tank top with the little glitter things on there.  What is that?  Studs.  Little diamond studs. 
[02:07:00]  It's a wow shirt, eh?  They say wow.  Nice.  Hey, can you smile?  Hey, she's ripping dice off.  I usually have that on the back of my jacket.  She's got a wow there.  All right, Bonnie, if you will.  A little wow for the boys.  For Norton there.  Oh, nice.  Nice.  You like that.  Natural and lovely, yes.  Very natural, very firm.  Yes.  That's good.  Hey, do the flashlights work on natural small ones?  We can try.  We can try.  You want to try?  All right, dim the lights.  Don't mind, Rick. 
[02:07:30]  He's going to hold these flashlights right under your breasts and light them up to see if even  the small ones can light up a little.  You need the implants.  Let's see.  I'm thinking not enough.  They might really hurt.  Let's see.  No.  See?  You need the implants, Anthony.  Wah, wah, wah, wah.  It's got to be implants.  Wow.  That's why this is a breast implant contest.  Wow, look at that.  Not a bad.  Well, yeah, but they're not lighting up that bright light.  It's kind of like when you put the flashlights in the back of your hand.  And go, ooh, look, it's an x-ray. 
[02:08:00]  They're kind of like little night lights.  Yeah.  They're nice night lights.  Nice.  There you go.  Now they're nice.  Wow.  Are you going tonight?  No.  Oh, it's 19.  I can't sneak her in for Norton.  It's not like she's going to leave alive.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  I want my gal to be able to see the show.  All right.  We've got to give out a few.  Norton, the preferred thing to do up here in Boston, you cut them in half, leave one half  in a dumpster, the other half, hide it at will. 
[02:08:30]  It's not another reference.  It gets props for local on that one.  Local reference is always good when the boys hit the road.  If I have sex, I won't even use a bag.  If I just get her pregnant, I'll shoot her and blame it on Earl.  Oh, God.  Speaking of Earl, where is he?  And is he doing anything?  He's playing video games.  He's playing video games. 
[02:09:00]  We bring Earl from New York to Boston and he does nothing.  I want you to play foosball all day with one of my interns.  Has he been playing foosball?  Oh, yeah.  Like I couldn't even get out of the studio door because his ass is up against it because  he's been playing foosball.  I wouldn't mind if he was getting better at it.  He's terrible.  He's like a mark.  Ben, we took Earl out last night and he just doesn't even socialize.  He just stands there in the corner and like...  Why that guy doesn't just go out and have a good time?  Here, get Earl in here so we can get his observations.  Where's Earl?  Yeah, he's been in Boston now for a while.  Anthony, a couple numbers real fast.  Yeah, in the New York area, 877-692-1027. 
[02:09:30]  Anywhere else, including Boston and New Hampshire, 866-277-4.  Wow, okay.  Bonnie, thank you.  Bonnie, very nice.  And unfortunately, you're underage for the party tonight.  If you could leave a way for Norton to contact you before you leave, that would be greatly appreciated.  I have an email.  Oh, look at you.  He's got that email.  You know, name, address, next of kin.  Something like that. 
[02:10:00]  Earl, get over here.  Absolutely nothing.  That's the problem.  Absolutely nothing, right?  Oh, it's a lovely thing.  He's whispering something in her ear.  Her ear, I said.  What?  In her rear.  Earl?  Yes.  We want to get your observations of Boston.  Oh, he's a nice guy.  I love Boston.  What have you done?  Anything?  I was hanging out with Ben.  I was hanging out with Steve.  I'm having a good time.  Yeah.  No, I mean, what have you done since we started broadcasting today? 
[02:10:30]  What's your job?  Everyone has a job.  No one has told me what my job is.  No, that's kind of, I thought, like, everyone that came up had something to do.  But for some reason, Earl came to hang out.  Earl, I was told, I was invited to Boston.  Which is cool.  That's all I was told.  To do what?  I don't know.  I like it.  He's the official Yankee fan of the show.  Ben sent me an email.  He goes, we're going up to Boston.  We'd like you to come.  Earl, you're going to Avalon with your black Yankee hat on?  Why not?  You're crazy.  Oh, I was like, everyone's going, ooh. 
[02:11:00]  I walked into, where were we last night?  Harvard Gardens?  Yeah.  And I came from the Islander game.  And I walk in with my Islander hat.  I'm like, oh, wow.  Wait.  Maybe I should take this off.  Oh, stop.  You're not.  It's like wearing, I'm the parent of a mongoloid child hat.  No one's going to make fun of it.  They feel sorry for you.  Islanders, please.  No one even noticed it was a Yankee hat until they looked really close.  Right.  Dude, you can't wear a Yankee hat in Boston.  I mean, you could wear one at Rascals.  You know what, there were Boston hats in the brink.  You whoo-ah.  What?  I just have to give out a number if I can throw it in. 
[02:11:30]  I don't like the plug.  What number would that be?  What number?  Wednesday through Saturday at Rascals for some jokes in South New Jersey.  Ocean, the 732-517-0002.  Write it down, you idiots.  It's a plug-in.  Are you having fun, though, in Boston?  I'm having a blast.  Yeah.  I'll take you to Salvi.  Later.  I'll pass.  Yeah.  I heard about Salvi.  All right, let's take a couple phone calls.  That's where Michael Mark's from.  Let's go to Chris on the national on line one there.  Thank you, Earl.  Thanks for adding absolutely nothing once again. 
[02:12:00]  Hey, Chris, what's going on today?  Yo, where's Tom Brokaw?  Uh-oh.  You mean we have to work today?  Where is Tom Brokaw?  Gee, I...  Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightly News.  I noticed my ratings have been dropping a little bit due to the lackadaisical reporting on NBC Nightly News's anthrax. 
[02:12:30]  Tom, you seem a little out of it today, a little woozy.  I confused my Cipro, which I've been taking for the anthrax, with my downers.  And I'm having a bit of a problem staying conscious during NBC Nightly News.  Well, maybe you shouldn't mix it with the Budweiser that we have in the corner here.  Hey, those Crystal Methic guys almost took all my beer.  Yeah.  Sons of bitches know how to drink, don't they?  They sure do. 
[02:13:00]  Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightly News.  In order to garner more ratings by catching yet another disease,  me, Tom Brokaw, will drink from the chafed mule of Jim Norton.  I will suckle like a hamster on that water bottle on his chafed mule wall.  Tom, I saw you outside the WBCN studios.  Yes, I was out trying to get girls so wowed. 
[02:13:30]  Yeah, you were in traffic with your little wow sign.  It was fascinating.  I'm just trying to, anything I do now is for ratings.  For ratings.  Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightly News.  I'm at odds with Dan Rather.  Because Dan, of course, has decided not to take the Cipro.  He pulled a trump card on me because I got the anthrax first,  but I'm taking the Cipro.  Now he's got it.  And he says, I'm not taking it.  F*** him.  You just ran out of breath there.  You all right?  Oh, I was smoking hashish with crystal methad and the cops came in. 
[02:14:00]  It was horrible.  But, yes, Dan Rather has taken it.  And what's with the pussies on Channel 7?  Don't they know how to get diseases?  They give it to a little baby.  Hell, Norton gave one hiv.  That's HIV.  If you're not familiar with your opinion.  Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightly News.  A very special episode of NBC Nightly News.  Live from Boston. 
[02:14:30]  I have athlete's foot and I'm footing a girl.  You ever see that?  We've all been emailed the pictures where you foot the girl with a big chafed Tom Brokaw foot.  Then I like taking the lips and grinding them with some sort of a cheese grater.  So, they're pulpy and bloody.  All right.  How far do you want me to go?  Pulpy and bloody.  And then I dine like it's filet man. 
[02:15:00]  A nice steak.  Geez, hasn't this old gag been done in sitcoms for years?  And then I will perform, you can see me in my newest video, Horse Gag.  Horse Gag.  On the internet.  You ever see where the girl's going on the horse and all of a sudden she goes.  I did that with Rather the other night.  He could swallow more man than any guy I know. 
[02:15:30]  Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightly News.  Tom, you're in Boston.  You're doing some.  I am.  You're doing some.  I'm a little.  Well, you're doing some of that investigative reporting up here.  Investigative reporting.  The airport here.  Well, no.  You're trying to find the secret room here at WBCN.  We've heard reports of the secret room.  Could it be terrorists related?  Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightly News.  WBCN's secret room. 
[02:16:00]  We're out of his keep CDs that he sells.  Much to people's chagrin.  We're looking for it.  I've been pulling levers.  Seeing if bookcases turned around.  I actually stepped in some of Mark Parenteau's.  As I went to look for something, I inadvertently left a trail like OJ left, leaving the crime scene.  But instead of blood, it was Mark's.  I swear to God. 
[02:16:30]  Some of the stuff around here.  You turn a black light on, it looks like when you walk into a club with a black shirt with lint on it.  We all know how that looks.  As a little gag, I've been calling Lou Dobbs Pickle Boy Jones.  A little local reference.  Okay.  Sorry for everyone else in the world.  And Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightly News.  Get me out of this, Sophie. 
[02:17:00]  All right.  Thank you, Tom.  Tom Brokaw.  Tom Brokaw.  NBC Nightly News.  There he goes.  Mr. Brokaw.  Let's go to Kathleen on line one of the national.  Kathleen?  Yeah, she's calling from Boston.  So let's see what she has.  Kathleen, what's going on?  Hi, guys.  I just want to say, I'm just listening to you guys in Jersey.  And I moved up here and so happy that's indicated.  But I swear they're giving us a bad name.  I would be so happy to wow, but I never see stickers. 
[02:17:30]  Where?  In Boston.  I'm thinking, I used to listen to Jersey.  I'm up here now.  Okay.  It takes time.  Yeah, we were just talking about that.  We just saw a wow sticker as we were walking down the street.  Right.  And it was one from New York.  Right.  It wasn't even one from BCN.  But we realized, God, it took like years of handing them out in New York before they were,  I mean, before you saw them no matter where you were.  Yeah.  I mean, the New York market is saturated with the wow stickers.  It's going to take time.  It takes some time. 
[02:18:00]  By the spring, these cities are going to have wow stickers all over them.  Yeah.  But the girls, see, look, you would wow if you saw a guy driving with a wow sticker, right?  I would totally wow, and I've got great class, and I would totally wow.  Are you, why aren't you coming by to say hi?  Oh, I would love to, but I actually work up in like New Hampshire, and I'm driving back  down there, and I bet I'll make it today.  Tomorrow.  Wow.  Well, there's ladies driving by BCN Studios to wow the guys out front.  Well, good.  If I get down there, I will totally wow. 
[02:18:30]  We're going to be here tomorrow.  I'll pry.  Right, but I don't want to.  You're saying how nice they are.  You've got to come by tomorrow then.  Now you're obligated.  Now everybody wants to, everyone wants to know what they look like, and we'll put them  on the internet.  That bumps me out.  It's always like, I would love to dot, dot, dot, but, but, but.  It's always the but.  Look, Rosie the Riveter with a 38C is coming by.  Hey, maybe we could whip man's asses.  If we can't get cans, we'll whip man ass. 
[02:19:00]  And Dave can watch, Dave.  Oh, Dave.  Good rock hole.  All right, Kathy.  I learned it from you, okay?  I learned it from you, Dave.  Well, maybe we'll see you tomorrow.  I'll try.  Okay, let's move on to Gerard, line four on the national line.  Gerardo.  Gerard has a comment about Norton.  What's up, Gerard?  Back in Boston. 
[02:19:30]  Yes.  Yeah, I was on the website, and I'm looking at these pictures of Norton.  I've never seen them before.  Right.  He is a scary, very scary man.  A scary man that gets more girls than you can imagine.  And they never leave as a person.  How many phone numbers have you gotten today, my friend?  What's that?  How many phone numbers have you gotten today?  I'm a fucking spot.  Gerard, I'm cute.  No, no.  I got a nice big lump.  One of the pictures on there is, uh...  I know, it's awful.  I saw the shot. 
[02:20:00]  I look like a retard.  The one from the conference room?  Yeah, and there's a poster behind you, and you've got, like, a garbled turkey neck thing going on.  Yeah, I know.  I stink.  I really am a homely little dumpy.  No, no, no.  I don't mean to come down on you, but guys, do me a mistake.  No, it's true.  It's all right.  Believe me.  I'm agreeing, bro.  Well, he hasn't slept in a couple days.  Right up to, uh, his little garbled neck, and guaranteed...  Garbled neck.  You make fun of him, but, uh, there's not enough shallow graves for the girls that Norton gets. 
[02:20:30]  I was going to say, the last chick is in here, you know, she's about to leave, and Norton's, like, whispering in her ear, and I'm like, he's secretly measuring her for a casket.  Oh, exactly.  Casket?  That's too high class.  A 55-gallon drum on the side of the highway.  I was checking the back of her shirt.  Size 14.  That's...  All right, Gerard, thank you.  It puts the lotion on its skin.  It does this whenever it's told.  I'm crying over you, crying.  Oh, he's dancing.  Jamie Gumb. 
[02:21:00]  Or Jane Gumb.  Serial killer movies.  It does this whenever it's told.  He is?  Let's go to line nine on the National and talk to Pat.  Hey, Pat, what's going on?  Hello.  Hey, man.  Hey, Pat.  How you doing?  Good.  Where are you going to be this year?  Are you dressing up or what?  Um, I guess we'll know tomorrow.  Everyone will know tomorrow when, uh...  You're not chickening out, are you?  No, I won't chicken out.  No way.  I'm going.  I'm having fun, man.  It's a costume party. 
[02:21:30]  I'm getting in a costume.  Jim, are you going to wear a costume?  Why would you ask me that?  Jim, of course, is not.  Nick, are you wearing a costume tonight?  I'm wearing it.  I'm an angry black man.  How you like my costume?  Trick or treat, bitch!  All right.  So, he's in costume.  I guess we'll find out tomorrow.  All right.  Northern rules.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Thanks, Pat.  You're my gobble neck.  Put a flashlight through your gobble neck.  That's the way you said, gobble neck.  Gobble.  That's funny.  We should take a break. 
[02:22:00]  All right.  And we'll continue the madness.  Opie and Anthony broadcast live from Boston.  We're at 1265 Boylston Street.  There's a party going on outside the studio.  I'm going to go check right now and see what's going on out there.  We're going to run right out to the sidewalk.  We're giving out Grave Rave tickets outside the studio.  We have these great WOW t-shirts, WOW bumper stickers.  So, if you're in the area, stop by and say hi.  And girls are finally driving by and wowing the guys on the sidewalk.  So, that's very cool.  We'll be back in a few.  Stay there.  Opie and Anthony.  And this is the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[02:22:30]  We're on the road.  We're live in Boston.  What a party going on outside, man.  My God.  What the hell is that?  It's pretty cool.  We're giving out tickets for the show tonight.  We're up here to host the Grave Rave with the Crystal Method.  Huge Halloween costume party.  And we're judging it.  And we're hosting it.  And we're just going to have a good time.  It doesn't involve too much work.  No, no.  Steve, you're going to get the camera in there and take all sorts of pictures, hopefully. 
[02:23:00]  Yeah, we've got lots of pictures of our trip on opianthony.com.  Not many exciting pictures yet, but it's going to get better.  Just more of a feel.  Yeah, we're broadcasting live tomorrow as well.  And hoping that more ladies come down for the Booba Lantern Contest.  We'll have to wait and see on that.  1265 Boylston Street.  Girls are driving by now and wowing the crowd outside.  That's pretty cool.  And we've got the really cool wow t-shirts and the wow bumper stickers that they're handing out like crazy outside.  So that's good. 
[02:23:30]  Oh, my.  Let's hit the phones and go to Mario on the New York line.  Line one.  Mario, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, O&A?  Hey.  Hey, I just have one question.  Did Norton have to register as a pedophile before he went to Boston?  Yeah, how many states are you allowed in at this point, Jim?  I can go into all 50 states when there's an illegal search and seizure involved and certain evidence is thrown out. 
[02:24:00]  There you go.  He's allowed.  See?  Hey, O&A.  Yeah.  One question.  Yeah.  Wasn't it Rick that went to the Loverboy concert and wasn't he laughing at Anthony for going to No Doubt?  Yeah.  Rick, who at some point in his life went to the Loverboy concert and he confessed to wearing makeup.  And this was, and I've got to be very careful how I say this, and this was when Loverboy wasn't cool.  If that makes sense. 
[02:24:30]  Oh, very good.  You said you have to be careful because you almost implied that.  No, because there was some point it was cool.  Well, there was a point where Loverboy was popular.  Let's just put it that way.  Popular good word.  Okay, all right.  Rick went to see Loverboy way past that.  I had to.  When what's his name was a big fat pig still trying to fit into that Chinese writing t-shirt.  The funny thing is I don't hear Rick laughing.  Wearing the headband.  No, he's not laughing at all.  I don't hear him.  What does he have to say?  He's waiting for a response, Rick.  I can't hear him.  He'd like to know why you went to a Loverboy concert. 
[02:25:00]  Because I got paid to go.  Oh, there you go.  On the radio.  All right, he got paid.  Were you escorting for an older gentleman?  Mario, it was all right because he went as Mad Max.  Yeah, it wasn't really Rick.  It was Mad Max.  You may have heard him in Florida.  Yeah, as long as it's Mad Max, it's okay.  Or Spuds.  All right, Mario, thank you.  Okay, fellas.  What did you call yourself, Rick, when you were doing the Universal Studios tours?  Oh, that was a studio guy.  But what was your name?  Hi, I'm your studio. 
[02:25:30]  Oh, it was just Rick?  It's with my name tag.  I thought maybe it was Max or something.  No, I had a name tag and everything.  Let's go to Dennis online, too.  It's the Cleaver House.  You might remember this is the Beaver Cleaver House.  But, of course, as we drive around back, you'll notice it's just a facade.  Facade meaning?  False front.  Thank you, Rick.  I like hearing it from the guy that did the tour.  Dennis, what's going on?  It's like Texaco.  Hey, what's up?  Jeez.  Dennis, what do you got for this mess?  Hey, can I play What Did I Learn Already?  Yeah, we can start that a little bit.  All right, I got a couple things.  I had learned, first, I learned a crow is only a good costume if you get accidentally shot in it. 
[02:26:00]  I learned fat girls have a body like a sub sandwich.  And I learned potpourri turns a bathroom into a glory hole.  Hey, there you go.  Hey, I taught somebody something today.  It's nice.  It did, Nick.  Thanks, Dennis.  You're schooling.  You know, we got to get a picture of the potpourri in the bathroom.  Yo, Anthony.  Yeah, now, see?  People love that stuff.  That's how you know a lot of chicks aren't showing up.  Wait till we get that potpourri shot on the website, guys. 
[02:26:30]  Yo, Anthony.  I know.  We're running out of things to shoot around here.  You can even see the urinal.  We tingled it all day.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  All right, let's talk to PJ on line three.  PJ, what's going on?  How you guys doing?  We're having fun.  I hope it sounds like something.  It sounds like something.  All right.  I got, uh, what I learned today is that, uh, that Opie plays the city's off like a kid  with divorced parents.  We did learn that.  Well, let's see.  Yeah, sure. 
[02:27:00]  We like Boston.  We like New York.  We like Philly.  We like, uh, we don't like Chicago because they preempt us for minor league hockey.  So they suck.  Minor league hockey.  How embarrassing is that?  All right, PJ.  Thank you.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  We get mad when we get preempted for the NFL.  Yeah.  NFL pregame shows.  But now we're starting to get preempted for minor league hockey.  Well, it was in Washington that we were, uh, preempted for, uh, football.  So that is minor league football.  Oh.  But what?  Oh. 
[02:27:30]  What?  Oh.  Oh, I'm supposed to be a Redskins fan?  We're going to a Redskins game next week.  Mm, you are.  I'm going to the Air and Space Museum.  Is it just general admission?  Huh?  Is it just general admission to the Redskins game?  No.  It's the only football game that offers floor seats.  It might make it more interesting.  Hey, Ben, your, uh, your friend stopped by with some clothes for the gang.  I remember this clown.  What?  We hung out at the Sauncees.  That's right.  What's going on?  It's a good entrance.  Greg?  Greg.  There you go. 
[02:28:00]  What's up, man?  Hey.  What did you bring, Jim?  Well, I brought Jim, uh, a nice little Ben Sherman shirt here.  I thought we'd dress him up nice for the ladies.  And you know, I would, I would actually consider wearing this either Wednesday, Thursday, Friday,  or Saturday at Rascals and Oceans.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  You have a shame.  If Jim gets his shameless plug, then I should, too, right?  Oh, Jim.  You can buy that shirt at karmaloop.com.  What is that?  Karmaloop.com.  It's a website.  Right.  And we sell cool clothes.  But, uh, how do you spell it? 
[02:28:30]  That's K-A-R-M-A-L-O-O-P.com.  The karma loop.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, you got to make that, uh, known to everybody.  It's tricky.  I just thought it would have seen, to tell you the truth.  He brought us all cool stuff.  Uh, Norton, will you wear that?  Oh, yeah.  If it fits me, I certainly will.  It's nice.  It's a nice burgundy.  Bring out the brown in my eyes.  Yeah.  I noticed that.  And I did a little research ahead of time to make sure that we got that color just right.  And also, if it's a time of the month, there won't be a clotting problem on my shirt. 
[02:29:00]  But, uh, it works for you.  Wait, wait, wait.  Rick's handed me a note.  Listener from outside.  Boob head guy?  What's that?  Yeah.  Who's, what's boob head guy?  Gotta bring him in.  We'll dress him up, too, in some cool clothes.  Oh, yeah?  And he'll get a free crystal method seat.  Oh, there you go.  See, Opie, he's a boob head guy.  Because, see, he's got boobs on his head.  Boob's on his head.  But they're not attached to his head.  He blew them up.  Wow, that is, like, pretty pathetic, my friend.  Well, you have to have something outside, you know?  Yeah.  You having fun outside? 
[02:29:30]  Oh, yeah.  It's a blast out there.  Are girls finally wowing?  Um, yeah.  We had a couple out there.  You guys brought some out there.  It was pretty nice.  Ah, yeah.  What about the girls driving by?  The girls driving by?  Yeah, we got a couple.  A lot of fingers and...  Horrified.  You look like you're all at me.  They are horrified.  Hey, you know, we were waiting for you guys to come to Blossom.  It's nice that you guys are finally here.  Well, thank you.  Awesome.  Took a while.  Yeah, but you're back, you know?  How quickly do the women slap their door locks down when you guys approach their vehicles? 
[02:30:00]  You get everything.  It's fun, man.  I don't know what to say to boobhead guys.  Because it's not boobhead guys.  He blew up two boobs and he just placed them on his head.  It's not a costume or anything.  Where'd you get those boobs from?  They're hiding the beer cans underneath.  Yeah, that he can drink out of the straw in his hat.  Yeehaw.  Where'd you get the boobs?  Across the street.  Oh.  Oh, there's a little porn store across the street.  Very convenient.  A porn store?  A porn store, yeah.  Right next to the gay club, right?  The Ramrod.  The Ramrod.  I swear to God, one time Parenteau walked over there.  No.  No. 
[02:30:30]  No, he went over there to the porn store because he had to buy socks.  Hey, I need socks.  Do they really have a porn store?  Are there booths?  No, no, no.  No, no, no.  Look, his face lit up like a child on Christmas.  Do they have booths?  This city's pretty clean these days.  There's no booth, it's not a porn store.  It's a library.  You bought that in a library.  There used to be a great area in Boston that you could just go and get a prostitute.  Combat zone.  Combat zone. 
[02:31:00]  It's gone.  You ever been in one, though?  This is true.  You ever been whacking your bag in a booth and you don't see the hole because it's dark?  And you don't see the hole, but you hear, pfft.  I one time, this is true.  What?  One time, I didn't know there was a hole in my booth.  There's a hole there.  For what?  It's a glory hole.  I don't know.  It's a past political ideas back and forth.  It's a glory hole.  Okay.  I didn't know it and I heard pfft, pfft.  And I looked down and it was a black guy and I just see a finger, like, waving at me. 
[02:31:30]  Saying, come here, come hither.  And then I'm like, no, no.  I'm trying to be quiet because it's embarrassing.  And he goes, puts his lips, and his tongue goes through the hole.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, rather tempting.  You're right here.  Was there one on both sides?  Like, if you wanted to go pfft, pfft to somebody?  No, which is why I asked him to leave so I could pfft, pfft, pfft to the next fellow.  I don't know.  I didn't look.  I just left.  You don't sit around and look at architecture when there's a man going pfft.  I kind of wonder why it was there. 
[02:32:00]  I'm sorry.  Hey, I got to ask Anthony something.  What?  You psyched that you could stay out past 930 in Boston?  This is great.  This is the first time.  You hear the laugh in the background?  This is the first time we're doing a radio event here up in Boston that I can stay out as long as I want.  And I don't have somebody that I have to drive home at, ooh, the ill hour of 930.  Wait, there's two things.  You can stay out late and you don't have to do any hard labor while you're in Boston. 
[02:32:30]  Yes.  I was able to come up here and I...  I'd like you to install my garage door opener.  But first you got to go to the Natick Mall and pick it up.  I already paid for it with my credit card.  So when they say it's been denied, you pay cash and bring it back to the house and spend your vacation installing my garage door opener. 
[02:33:00]  And now tonight is the great way I'll accompany you.  But make sure you be careful driving that because three rides make left.  I don't make left on turns.  It's too hard.  And it's talking about his ex-mother-in-law, just in case you're wondering.  This would...  Well, every time I came up here, I'd go into shock because it was...  I'd have to do work.  I would have to...  It's like, excuse me, lady.  I've been in radio now.  I don't have to, like, work anymore. 
[02:33:30]  I worked my ass off in construction.  Now, for my vacation, I have to install garage door openers.  And then we'd go out, me, Opie, Jay, and we'd have a pisser until about 9, 9.30 when I would hear, I want to go home.  The reason she was there in the first place is my wife at the time would say, Mom wants to go.  Oh, really?  I don't perish the thought I said anything else, like, why or no.  So I would have to... 
[02:34:00]  I'd cave in.  I would cave in, okay, to kind of put off an impending argument.  And that's what I would get.  9.30, I want to go home.  Um, I'm hanging out, you know what I mean?  Oh, we're hanging, Jay, we're talking.  This is a great time.  Why, you know, why do I have to go home?  I want to go home.  I want to go home.  I had a grommelier.  I had my box of wine at home.  And now it's time to go home. 
[02:34:30]  Drive me home.  So you can stay out.  So tonight, I am thrilled to death.  Tonight, I am able to hang out and party without any worry of,  It's already 9.30.  Take me back to my box of wine.  Or any fear that I might wake up the next day and find out you went into another apartment.  Um, Anthony, by mistake.  Uh, Anthony, look around.  Everyone is feeling very uncomfortable as you relayed this story to Boston.  I'm sorry.  Well, you didn't know about, um, these things would happen occasionally. 
[02:35:00]  Oh, I'm sorry.  Hi, I'm home.  I'm, I'm just, it's been late and I'm just going to fall asleep on the couch.  Until the next morning when somebody wakes her up and goes,  Why are you in my apartment?  It was big.  How was I supposed to know I was in the apartment next door?  Well, they all look alike.  I should have known when I walked in and I didn't see Chester.  But now Chester's in the urn waiting for me to die so we could be buried together. 
[02:35:30]  Oh, yeah.  I heard that story.  How many times did I walk in and I was so tempted to crack that lid on the Chester urn.  Did you ever look in?  No.  You never looked in at the Chester ashes?  I think I moved out before Chester died.  You had visited occasionally.  Right?  I moved out before Chester died.  God knows.  You spent five years in the woman's house, I think it was.  Five months.  I was out of there in like a week.  I lived with Anthony's mother-in-law up here for five months. 
[02:36:00]  Yes.  Come here, football.  I mean, come here, Chester.  What?  I got confused with another dog.  She still likes me.  She still likes me.  She still likes Opie.  But she took down all our pictures because I'm in him.  But Anthony's in him.  It's a horrible thing, but I love Opie.  This is exactly what she sent to the pictures as she's taking them down, too.  So what I did was I cut in half the Dimension World poster because I still like Opie. 
[02:36:30]  So I hung that up.  But I burnt and crushed the Anthony side.  I thought I liked the honor for any of your stuff, man.  Hey, you wouldn't have any of my clothing.  Oh, open smoke flames.  Yes.  Okay.  Thanks.  Thank you.  Remember the radio control helicopter?  Oh, burnt.  Okay.  Horrifying explosion.  Yes.  Yes.  Jeepers creepers.  I think people are getting uncomfortable.  And it still goes on and on and on and never ends. 
[02:37:00]  Donald Trump could have sold his boss quicker.  All right.  Let's go to the phones and talk to John.  I think that's the New York line.  John?  Yeah.  John, what's going on?  John, could you drive me home?  I want to go home.  John?  Three rides make a laugh.  Three rides?  Why do you have to make such a dangerous left-hand turn when all you've got to do is make three  rides and it equals a left?  You're dangerous making left-hand turn.  Of course, it takes me five hours just to drive from Oshlin to Natick.  But I do it all in left-hand, right-hand turns. 
[02:37:30]  Another local reference.  I'll never forget the time we first moved to Boston.  And we had to fly out to L.A. for, was that the Grammys or the Oscars, the fake Oscar trip?  That was the time I took the howitzer on the plane through Logan, right?  Remember?  And we didn't really know Boston yet because we were only working at the station a couple  weeks.  Yeah.  And we needed a ride to Logan for, you know, to catch our flight to L.A.  And your ex-mother-in-law said she would drive us in the morning, but she wouldn't drive us 
[02:38:00]  to the airport.  Oh, no.  To the Logan Express at the Natick Mall.  So she said, we'll get you to, yeah, Logan Express at the Natick Mall, like Anja said.  And we were coming from Ashland.  Now, for the people that don't have a clue, that's probably a five-minute ride, especially  first thing in the morning.  Town over.  Maybe ten minutes.  We were in the car for, am I exaggerating when I say close to an hour?  Yeah, it was close to an hour.  And we thought we were on our way to Logan Airport. 
[02:38:30]  We had no idea.  We were like, wow, she lives far from the airport.  I like going through Sherbin when we go this way.  I go through and back roads.  That's when we learned about the three lefts make a right.  Three rights make a left.  Three rights make a left.  And, well, that works, too.  Yeah.  But it's much more than ancient.  And then she drops us off at the Logan Express in Natick.  And we still had almost an hour ride.  She drove you an hour out of the way so you could take a bus back to the airport?  To the airport.  From Ashland, when we left, she dropped us off at the Logan Express in Natick. 
[02:39:00]  We assume we're really close to the airport at this point.  And we're just jumping on the airport shuttle.  She did not want to drive on Route 9.  Now, we're being really local now.  But Route 9 rode a lot of lights.  It's very difficult to make a left on 10.  So she would take all these back roads where when we finally popped out in the parking lot,  I'm like, oh, my God, the airport's got to be visible.  I'm looking for low-flying aircraft.  Yeah, we're looking for the plane.  I'm like, we got to because she drove us on the tarmac for some reason. 
[02:39:30]  It took this long.  And, no, it was the bus ride because I can't make a left on 10.  Right.  And then we got to know the lay of the land, and we finally said to each other, dude.  It was like a year later.  We went, dude, did you realize how close the Logan Express is to that?  Right, right, right, right.  Horrid.  But that was my hell.  My hell, Opie.  My hell.  All right.  We're running out of steam here.  Tonight's going to be a great night.  I'm going to have a lot of fun, and we'll have a full report for those of you that couldn't join us tomorrow on these very airwaves. 
[02:40:00]  But tonight, party time.  But Uncle John's there.  Yeah, let's talk to Uncle John on the New York line.  Line three.  Uncle John, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Fun show today.  It was fun.  I learned a couple of things today.  You want to hear them?  Yeah, sure.  All right.  First, I learned that small natural boobs make nice night lights.  Yeah.  I learned that Rick James, the frequent kidnapper.  Wait, say that again.  Then you broke up.  I'm sorry.  I said I learned that Rick James, the frequent kidnapper.  Oh, frequent kidnapper. 
[02:40:30]  Yes, yes.  And the last thing was that now that ONA are doing pumpkin carving jokes, the boss of the school will be doing dick jokes.  See you guys.  Thank you, Uncle John.  Who listens much too closely.  Tomorrow, Chris Robinson's stopping by as we continue our little Boston trip.  Jim Cook.  Jim Cook is stopping by with some Sam Adams, right?  Ixnay on the Ud Bay.  What?  Today was a Budweiser day.  Tomorrow will be a Sam Adams day.  That's a high best.  Everyone understands that in New York.  I brought my own.  That we split the beers up. 
[02:41:00]  The crystal method tonight at Avalon.  That's going to be fun.  We're going to take pictures.  So I think we're going to get off the air a little early so we can go and party on the sidewalk.  Let's rock.  Rick, we got a little something we can play as we leave?  We can go to a couple more phones as we...  Dan, what's going on?  Let's go to Dan on line 10 from New York.  Dan, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  I want to play What Did We Learn?  Sure.  Today I learned that Jim Norton looks like one of those progeria kids.  And that he'll be performing at Rascal's Ocean Township from Wednesday through Saturday. 
[02:41:30]  Nice.  Oh, you're Jim Norton's whore.  Good God.  All right, bro.  Thank you.  All right.  Very pleasing man.  Does he owe you oral treats?  Hey, we didn't do Progeria Boy today.  No, he didn't show up today for some apparent reason.  That's great.  I am.  Yeah, I'm only nine years older, but I got the advanced aging disease.  Which, you know, you've seen us on the talk shows.  I got a skull like an easy white rolling paper, and you can watch the synapses sparking in my brain. 
[02:42:00]  But I'm a normal kid.  Yeah, sure.  I'm just like a normal kid.  I do everything normal kids do, skateboard.  You do the skateboarding and play the video games.  I ride bikes.  I play video games.  You get to meet Britney Spears backstage at concerts.  I'm Britney Spears, and I gaze at her with those big, hard-boiled egg eyeballs that us kids have.  Have you ever seen us on the show?  I got that big, long, fragile nose like a pretzel rod.  I could just crack right off at any moment.  But I don't let that change what I am.  Because you're a normal kid. 
[02:42:30]  I'm a normal kid.  I'm just a normal kid, but trying to live life as a normal kid or a mayfly, one or the other.  So I just watch time tick away.  Yeah.  Tick away.  You going down to Disney World or what?  Yeah, I get there for free.  The Make-A-Wish Foundation sends me down there.  Yeah.  And I get to cut the lines, which is great, because a long enough line, I could do my whole  life.  The whole thing.  Like, I'll just spend the rest of your life on the Space Mountain line.  So they put me right there, which is kind of hard, though, too, because I got that big  alien head on that little pencil neck. 
[02:43:00]  And some of the G's on that Space Mountain, it could fly my blown eggshell head right into  a track if I'm not too careful.  But I'm a normal kid.  I like doing normal kid things.  Skateboarding.  I like to roll a blade.  And then you came up to Boston to hang with us.  Yeah, I figured I'd come up here and come up to Boston.  The trip was, what, about three hours from New York, which is about 20 years of my life.  Thank you very much. 
[02:43:30]  But it was fun.  You know, I don't take anything for granted.  Uh-huh.  And, yeah, I got toes like those little corn nuts that you used to eat.  Those fried...  Hey, someone steps on my foot, they just shatter.  I'm a nine-year-old kid, though.  You know, stuck in the body of a 97-year-old man.  That's all.  All right.  Well, thanks for coming by.  No problem.  Thank you.  How long was I on the air?  About three minutes?  Three minutes.  Eh, good.  Five years.  Thank you.  Wait, someone had...  Let's go to Jay on line one in New York. 
[02:44:00]  Hey, Jay, what's going on, bro?  Hey, what's up?  I love that Jim got a Hummer for $7 and two cigarettes.  Ah, yes.  What a fuck, man.  You were paying attention.  Very good.  Anthony's broke off sucks when he's on the spot.  Sorry, Ed.  Sorry, Ed.  Peace.  Oh, yeah.  And Crystal Method's fag music.  Let's go to Joe on line four.  I like that Tom Brokaw.  I said it.  Joe, what's up?  I know when my brokaw sucks.  I've said it before.  I don't think that's up.  No, it was good today.  Joe, what's up?  Hey, guys. 
[02:44:30]  I learned Norton's got a backup plan for when he gets to go pregnant.  And I learned Stinky has a whole army of sisters.  Yes, he does.  We met another Stinky sister today.  All right.  That's all the time we got.  We got to get the hell out of here.  We got a party to do at Avalon on Lansdowne Street.  We're looking forward to it.  First time we're appearing in front of a crowd since we got fired.  We're going to continue to party on the sidewalk outside WBCN Studios.  Jesus.  Like wine oats.  I know.  We're going to do this tomorrow with Chris Robinson, Jim Cook. 
[02:45:00]  I want to thank Nick Carter for stopping by and supporting us.  I want to thank you.  Honestly, it's like two guys actually learned something from me today.  It's nice.  Maybe we could meet under a bridge tomorrow after the show.  What's wrong with that?  It's just a whole flat walk thing.  There's some fun people that live under the bridges.  All right.  We got all right, Ben.  We got to go.  We'll see you guys tomorrow.  Thank you.  We're still stupid.  Well, if that's what it takes to get good ratings, we'll continue being stupid.  We don't care.  We don't care.  I've been expecting you to make exactly that asinine statement.
