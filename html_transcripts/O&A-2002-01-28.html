<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a discussion of the AFC Championship game, focusing heavily on the Patriots' victory and the resulting fallout.  A show staffer, "Stinky," was on air, facing the consequences of a bet where he threatened self-harm if the Patriots reached the Super Bowl. His suicidal ideation was discussed in a darkly humorous manner, with the hosts and callers suggesting various methods of self-harm for comedic effect.  The game's outcome was debated extensively, with much mockery directed at the Steelers and their fans.  Anthony predicted the Patriots would lose the Super Bowl, while a confused caller believed the Steelers were playing the Carolina Panthers.  The hosts also heavily promoted their "Naughty Nighty" contest, featuring calls from participants in various cities who described themselves and teased sending in risqué photos.  They recounted a comedian's disastrous Philadelphia performance (with the comedian, Wes, calling in afterward), and detailed receiving a police escort in Philadelphia, with a humorous anecdote about a "Naughty Nighty" contestant's reaction to the cold. A doctor, "Dr. Norton," briefly called in to discuss a patient's foot problems.  A significant portion of the show featured a heated phone segment with Boston listeners angrily confronting sports commentator Scott Ferrall over his anti-Patriots comments.  Ferrall responded aggressively, resulting in a flurry of insults and threats.  Finally, the hosts announced that Steve-O from *Jackass* would be a guest later in the show.

The second segment featured a heavily intoxicated Steve-O, promoting his new DVD, *Don't Try This at Home*.  The segment began with several vulgar and sexually suggestive calls.  Scott Pharrell, a caller, expressed strong anti-Patriots sentiment. Steve-O, visibly drunk, was praised by the hosts despite his self-deprecating comments.  The conversation centered on his DVD's extreme stunts, including blowing up artillery shells and eating a barbecued squirrel, as well as the problematic "Career Ender" bonus segment featuring explicit sexual content.  He discussed past stunts like a butt piercing, waxing, and a medical study involving livestock drugs that dangerously increased his heart rate.  He even recounted a prank where he and his crew allegedly kidnapped Brad Pitt. Callers responded with a mix of disgust and admiration.  The segment culminated in Steve-O performing on-air stunts: snorting salt, squirting lime juice in his eyes, breaking a lightbulb over his head, and cutting his tongue with a shard, all while drinking tequila. He discussed his past as a clown and his motivation for extreme stunts.

The third segment opened with Steve-O already injured from the previous segment, spitting blood after cutting his tongue.  He dismissed a caller's concern.  The discussion immediately turned to extreme and sexually suggestive topics, including Dee, Steve-O's girlfriend, performing stunts involving catching objects between her breasts.  Jim Norton's presence in the studio was noted.  The hosts and Steve-O recounted previous stunts, including throwing cherry darts at a naked stripper’s genitals and a game called "cooter ball."  Dustman called in, and the hosts connected with Natalie, a "Naughty Nighty" contestant from Sacramento, who teased sending pictures. The hosts discussed Natalie's attractiveness extensively. The conversation continued with outrageous stunts and sexual innuendo, with Steve-O detailing self-inflicted injuries and future plans. Dee joined in, engaging in suggestive banter and partially undressing on-air while Steve-O was briefly absent. She drank tequila and Xanax. The hosts repeatedly mentioned posting pictures of Dee and other contestants on their website. A heated, profane phone conversation between Frenchie and Marion occurred.

Further stunts were planned and executed, including Steve-O diving over studio equipment and hitting his head.  The segment involved stapling objects to Steve-O, more "Naughty Nighty" contestants, and further sexually suggestive conversations.  The hosts repeatedly promoted Steve-O's video and the "Naughty Nighty" contest.

The final segment featured Steve-O stapling his scrotum to his pubic hair (dubbed "the turtle") with assistance from a female guest, "D".  A listener, Frenchie, accidentally stapled his own hand. Numerous listener calls reacted to these events with amazement or disgust. The hosts emphasized the outrageous nature of the events and their suitability for video recording, promoting foundrymusic.com to view the footage. The "Naughty Nighty" contest was again promoted. The studio clock was reportedly broken by Steve-O. The broadcast was filled with profanity, vulgar sexual discussions, and references to drug and alcohol use. The show ended with a promise to discuss "Gay Kandahar" and Super Bowl ticket giveaways in a future show.

[00:12:00]  Now, the far center.  Make sure you put on the brakes.  It's the far.  It's the far.  Far.  How close could you get to saying the word without saying it?  No, you can't say that.  I just want to.  They didn't dump out.  No, because you talked in between.  The far.  No. 
[00:12:30]  What?  I don't know.  I don't know.  That's what it is.  Take it easy because Laura Engels is working the dumb button.  Yeah.  So, yeah, they had a lacrosse game going there.  They wanted us to go down and say a little something to the crowd before the game.  We brought four of the chicks.  From the Naughty Nighty contest.  From the Naughty Nighty contest.  Hey, New York, Philly just putting you to shame as far as the Naughty Nighty contest.  Risquevideo.com.  That's what they were from.  Right.  Hot girls.  My God.  We brought them down there. 
[00:13:00]  I got to tell you something.  Morgan, that chick that went, she had the little red devil bikini thing on and the horns and the tail.  Well, she got out of one of the cars that were in our little police caravan.  And it was a little chilly.  She got these goosebumps all over her body.  She's trying to stay warm.  It was so hot to watch.  Just watch it freeze.  Freeze, you hot bitch.  Yeah, they put those four girls on the big screen.  The place went nuts.  Yeah.  It was great.  But the police escort. 
[00:13:30]  I felt like I was living Grand Theft Auto 3.  Yeah.  You know in Grand Theft Auto 3 you steal a police cruiser and you put the siren on and  the cars start going up on the curb and stuff?  That's what we were watching live.  It was great.  We're in there.  It's just, here we come.  Oh my God.  It must be something very important if there's a caravan there.  Police escorted.  Oh, it's just two dopey DJs and their peeps.  So we were just cruising through all kinds of traffic.  My favorite move? 
[00:14:00]  I have two.  Ben, I know one of your favorites was the guy that went to go get out of our way and  almost hit the brick wall.  The big cement wall.  He swerved hard to the right.  Yeah.  And then my other one was when we came up to the side street and the cars had nowhere  to go so they pulled up on the sidewalk to let us go.  That was amazing.  That thing through the intersections.  Yeah, we want to thank Philly for showing us another great time.  So then we go to the TLA for Norton's two sold out shows. 
[00:14:30]  He completely killed.  And Keith Robinson warmed up for Jim officially.  He killed as well.  Plenty of beer there.  They totally hooked up everybody involved with the show.  It wasn't one of those things.  Because I've been to some shows where you go there and there's just nothing.  I'm like scrounging up a beer, a warm beer somewhere.  Boy, they had us hooked up.  Yeah, that YSP did a great job, man.  Yeah.  Hooking everything up.  And then you decided to throw this kid a bone west from WYSP.  You're going to help out one of the young and up and comers. 
[00:15:00]  And have him.  Here, Norton.  Start the whole show for you.  Yeah, he was a nice guy.  He emailed me.  He said he wanted to go on and do this.  And Keith's a friend of mine.  I knew Keith and I were doing this show.  But I'm like, all right, yeah, why not?  I mean, I didn't know if you guys were going to go on and say hello or not.  But I'm like, yeah, go ahead.  And he went on.  So this is the guy that he works for WYSP.  He's a what?  The van driver.  And he wants to be a stand-up comic.  I guess his friends think he's funny.  Kind of, you know, clown kind of guy.  He's got balls because the crowd absolutely hated him. 
[00:15:30]  And he kept going like a trooper.  Especially during the first show.  The second show, he was so snotty.  He just started yelling and screaming at the audience for his ten minutes.  But they were giving him a hard time.  And we were in the back rolling because he's just screaming at them.  Oh, it was great.  I could not stop laughing.  I am pissed at myself that we did not put a tape on the board and get his performance  so we could play it for the whole country today.  How were we to know it was going to be that bad?  The first show, he's just bombing like I've never seen a comedian bomb before. 
[00:16:00]  Seriously.  The worst ever, right?  I've seen worse.  You've seen worse than I've ever seen.  Yeah.  Who?  Under circumstances, that was a tough situation to go on in.  I've seen guys in great situations have horror.  You know what I mean?  It's like that was a tough situation and he took it like a man.  He just sat there and screamed at him.  So I give him credit for that.  All right.  Wow.  Yeah.  So he's going at it for like five or six minutes and the crowd is just hating him.  They're booing him.  And he decides that it's going so well that he's going to now sit down on the stool that's 
[00:16:30]  on the stage.  You know how they're...  Like Cosby does when he comes out there.  Every comedian has to have a stool that they'll take a little rest and sit down for a few  minutes.  He decides to sit down and one of the best heckle lines I've ever heard in my life, and  I've been to some comedy clubs in my day, guy stands up and goes, hey, why don't you  take a seat out here with us?  And that just unleashed hell.  Oh, man.  That was it.  After that guy said that, it was, boo, you suck, get off, F you. 
[00:17:00]  And he muddled through that and then went up for the second show after he got hammered.  Right.  And that one, it's a whole new crowd, but we know how this is going to end.  Like, we know.  We know how it's going to end.  It's not going to be, wow, you tanked in that first show, but boy, the second show, you  killed.  How did that happen?  We know it's going to end up the same ugly way.  We're just waiting for it to start.  So he gets on stage.  He starts his act.  He's going over some really obscure school references from his college, I guess. 
[00:17:30]  And the crowd is giving him a minute, you know, kind of listening to him.  Maybe it pays off in the end.  And it kept going on and on and on.  And one guy yells out, what the F are you talking about?  And then, ah, boo, you suck.  And then everyone got it.  That was it.  It takes one guy to unleash hell.  So then he's just like, he's cursing out the audience and going, the ribs are going to  kick the Eagles ass.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I thought he was going to die. 
[00:18:00]  Because it was the second show, you know.  Dan from Hoboken asking, did he bomb worse than Vinny the Racist at the WWF restaurant?  Oh, good question.  Yes.  Yes.  Absolutely.  Worse.  And Dan, you were there.  Worse than Vinny the Racist bombed at WWF.  When we were doing that XFL pregame.  Worse than our bombing.  And no.  No, not that bad.  And Vinny was warming up the audience.  And yeah, he took it bad.  Yes.  Here's the kid himself, Wes.  Ah, Wes.  Wes from Philly.  Wes.  Yeah, what's going on?  How you doing, man?  I'm hanging in there. 
[00:18:30]  I'm in depression.  How many drinks did you have after that debacle?  I don't know.  I'm still drinking.  Now, when did you know it was going bad?  Probably when they were booing me.  That's funny.  When they started training Eagles.  That was the real getter.  I was like, this isn't the Eagles game.  This is Wes.  Listen to me.  Now, Wes, how old are you?  I'm on 19.  Yeah, so he's a young guy.  Oh, dude, you're only 19?  Yeah, I'm only 19.  You're going to be fine. 
[00:19:00]  You're going to be fine.  Now, you probably had some image of how this was going to go.  I've done it.  I've been doing it for two years.  Oh, you have?  I've been doing my open mics and other stuff like that, but usually in front of black people.  This is in front of a group of white people.  What is that?  You're a white guy.  The white people think I'm funny.  The black people think I'm funny.  Are you trying to say that black people don't have a sense of humor?  No, I'm trying to say that white people don't start booing me before.  Before I get on the stage.  Yeah.  Oh, so black people think you're funny.  Yes.  But white people don't.  You're a white guy. 
[00:19:30]  Yeah, that's weird.  That's weird, huh?  I know.  And I don't even like throw that weird kind of effect going.  Are they laughing at you, the black people?  Probably.  Because I'm bigger than all of them.  Maybe that.  Joe wants to know, is Wes Voss's version of Tony Clifton?  Tony Clifton?  That's a good reference.  Dude, if you're doing comedy and you don't know who Tony Clifton is.  I know who Tony Clifton is.  Do some research, my friend.  I know who Tony Clifton is.  Andy Kaufman.  There you go.  Good job.  Well, Wes, you took it like a trooper.  Me and Keith, we were all of us howling in the back at you, just screaming back at the 
[00:20:00]  crowd.  You didn't run off.  You didn't cry about it.  You just took it like a man.  Good for you, man.  Screw them.  Screw Philadelphia.  You hear that, all your listeners out there?  No, I love Philly, man.  But it was just, it was one of those things that happens, and man, you really just, you  took it like a man, so.  Hey, you learned how to open a beer with an iron.  Yeah, that was kind of weird.  That was kind of like, I don't know, I thought I was going to answer it.  I didn't know if it was really happening or not.  Yeah.  Well, good job, Wes.  All right, thanks, guys.  All right, Wes.  There he goes, Wes.  All right.  Who opened up for Norton.  On South Street. 
[00:20:30]  How hot are those girls at YSP, Tonya and Kim?  It bugs me.  I can't even go to that station anymore.  Oh, really?  I can't go there.  Yeah, well, yeah, I saw you all googly-eyed as these girls.  The nicest ladies working at some place.  And then all the girls that came in for the Naughty 90 contest in Philly.  Let me just give you an update on the Naughty 90 contest.  We will be qualifying all this week, okay?  Right.  We have one girl that has joined the contest in Buffalo.  One from Buffalo.  One so far in Buffalo.

[00:21:30]  We have Boston, Washington, San Francisco, and Sacramento.  Those cities are in this contest as well.  No representation as of yet.  We got some quality girls from Philly.

[00:22:00]  Yes.  Before we wrap up our talk on Philly, before we take a break and we will get Scott Farrell  on the air, it's going to get ugly with Scott Farrell.  Oh, yeah.  Look at the national line.  Wants to bitch out Farrell as well.  Of course.  How many times till Farrell learns to pick the pats?  Wants to beat the hell out of Farrell.  Wants to tell Farrell to eat it.  Wants to send a huge FU to Farrell.  You'll have your chance to talk to Scott Farrell.  He trashed Boston really bad last week.  Is he going to be sympathetic and apologize that he called it wrong or is he just going 
[00:22:30]  to lay into him more and say, when it comes to the big dads, they're not going to win.  I was listening to him this morning.  You know, he does our morning show here in New York.  You're crazy if you're not listening to Scott Farrell.  I'm telling you, he's one of the best morning shows in New York right now already.  If you're going with the sports guys.  Already.  Farrell there.  Well, they throw some other crap in there as well.  I already know what his whole angle is on the Super Bowl and it might infuriate people  even more.  Oh, good.  Great.  So stick around for Scott Farrell. 
[00:23:00]  But so the next day we all wake up and a bunch of us decide to walk South Street in Philly.  Norton and I and Ben was with one of his friends down there.  Yeah.  Ben decides he needs to drink at noon on a Saturday.  Whatever.  It's cool.  I mean, South Street's a great area.  I'd have been right with you, man.  Money Marys.  Oh, come on.  Noon is late for a bloody.  Usually it's 10.  We decide to walk.  Yeah.  Jimmy and I decide to walk South Street and just mess with people.  We had fun.  But then Ben calls me and I couldn't understand what he was saying.  So I just announced to everyone that Ben's drunk again. 
[00:23:30]  And then he gets mad at me because I couldn't understand what you were doing.  Basically, he was in a bar drinking bloodies with his friend and some girl that he said was a prostitute.  I don't know what she was.  I don't know what.  She came in with a real short skirt.  One guy who was really.  She was hot, too.  One guy was real old.  One guy was young.  And they were doing things with their things.  Oh, yeah.  Right for everyone to see.  It was great.  You know how you have 10 of these?  Right.  Digits. 
[00:24:00]  They were doing things.  Things with digits.  They were doing things with their things.  It was fascinating.  In front of everybody.  It was great.  So, Ben, I need like a micro cassette or something that I can tape my cell phone calls with.  He's laughing like a little school girl.  Like, he can't believe what he's saying.  And I'm trying to be like, the whole bar is freaking out.  Yeah.  Checking out this whole scene.  And then what?  They staggered out?  It's too bad, too, because you guys got there.  You said the girl, it was obvious, was doing blow.  Oh, yeah.  They were all messed up.  But you guys missed it by like five minutes. 
[00:24:30]  I was so pissed.  Norm would have loved it.  It was hilarious.  All right, Philly.  Hilarious.  And I'm looking for Doc Martens on South Street.  What a loser.  It's a cool street.  South Street's cool.  Yeah, but you're watching a girl and the guy's knuckle deep.  And I'm looking for shoes.  You almost bought the British shoes.  I bought two pairs when I got back.  Did you?  Yeah, that night.  He was looking at Doc Martens.  One was like the British flag.  I'm like, dude, stop.  I didn't buy them.  Stop.  The old Union Jack on there.  And then a bright red one.  I like them.  The red ones I'm going to get.  You like the bright red ones?  It's a burgundy oak. 
[00:25:00]  Whatever.  Red, burgundy.  The train ride back, too.  Steve C. got the ones with the flames on them.  But they're not colored flame.  It's got the flame pattern.  And usually they're painted red.  But he got them like that, but not painted.  Is he wearing those today?  Someone is saying that a girl in D.C. tried to enter the Naughty Nighty contest,  but she was too stupid.  Jamie, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  You work at JFK?  Yeah.  No, I don't work at JFK.  All right.  I listen on JFK.  No, the guys that come on after you, the junkies, they had a girl came down during their show 
[00:25:30]  and wanted to get her pictures taken to enter the contest,  but apparently she's too stupid to know what time to come down.  So why don't those guys help us out and take pictures anyway?  I have no idea.  They had her on the air.  We're talking to her.  They had her trying on hats and stuff.  Maybe because we're giving them a crap lead-in, Opie?  If I could come up with one answer.  Well, I hope we get at least one girl to represent Washington in the Naughty Nighty contest.  Yeah, that would be nice.  Ladies, if you're hearing our voices right now and you've got a Naughty Nighty,  show up at the studio and someone will take your pictures and send them off to us. 
[00:26:00]  Yes, Jim?  I hope they got pictures in their hats for the funny hat contest.  Why would they have her try on hats?  They were doing a thing with her.  They were just trying to get their logo on a hat,  and they were having her try on their hat to see how the logo looked.  All right.  Thanks, Jamie.  You know one other thing I've got to say?  Yeah.  There's nothing more fun than traveling with Norton.  I told you that last time.  It is so much fun.  It's hours of embarrassment and cringing. 
[00:26:30]  All right.  Okay.  Hey, baby doll.  When he calls you that, like you're walking a little too ahead of him in a restaurant,  anywhere where there's a lot of people that go,  baby doll, baby doll.  You're like, I'm not turning around, man.  I'm not baby doll.  I got opened like 40 times on South Street.  I beg.  And then I have to just tell people, look, this is what he does.  We were checking in.  Overheard conversation bit.  We were checking into the hotel on, what, Thursday night? 
[00:27:00]  And he had all this, he was going with the whole gay angle as we're getting our bags  out of the car and stuff.  Yeah.  I can't wait to get upstairs.  I'm tired.  You know, I'll rub your back.  You rub mine.  Oh, God.  Then he's showing like the guys taking our bags out of the car.  Like he buys underwear for his trip to Philly.  I didn't have any clean underwear.  I feel like every other man.  I just buy it.  That's good.  Yeah, sure.  He bought white briefs and then the model is a black guy with just his white briefs  with his junk.  And he's showing the guy and saying, look, look, he's packing, huh? 
[00:27:30]  And then he turns to me and goes, you know, I got your favorite underwear.  It was just so bad.  And after doing a show Thursday, then driving all the way down to Philly, he was like, oh,  I don't want to deal with this crap right now.  It was funny.  At the end of the week.  You bought briefs?  No, they were boxers.  Oh, that was the most shocking part of the story.  No, no.  After having that, I didn't even go so close.  No, dive by.  All right.  All right.  Oh, you stink.  Loser.  What a shock. 
[00:28:00]  Fat belly trips on a word.  All right.  Here we go.  Awful.  We have so much stuff to do.  It's not even funny.  Up next, Scott Pharrell.  We'll take it like a man.  Yeah, right.  He will be fighting like a mother ever.  We'll see.  If you're going to get on the phone with Pharrell, I'll give you a little advice.  This is just for Boston because he trashed Boston.  And the Pats and Bledsoe are so bad last week.  And they're already standing by today.  Let me give you advice.  Get your thoughts together now.  Be concise and be very aggressive. 
[00:28:30]  Or he will stomp you.  He will stomp you.  There you go.  All right.  So we'll talk to Scott Pharrell next.  That'll be a lot of fun.  Also on the show today.  Yeah, we're going to have Super Bowl tickets.  Oh.  And I think, and I think, can we use that word or do we have to say the big game?  Don't you hate that?  Super Bowl.  The big dance is better.  The big dance.  We have tickets to the big game.  And I think, I think we're going to go to Boston to give them away. 
[00:29:00]  Oh.  I think we're going to be broadcasting Friday from Boston as the O&A road trip continues.  It does seem that way.  It does seem like we're gearing up for a little Boston road trip.  We're working out the details.  As soon as we have them, we'll make them available to you.  But I think we pretty much have the last couple pairs of tickets to the Super Bowl.  We are whoas.  Yeah.  You see who's been staring through the window.  Yeah.  Frenchie's here.  We'll talk to him.  Frenchie.  Ladies could qualify for the Naughty Nighty contest today here in New York. 
[00:29:30]  If you're in the area and you've got a Naughty Nighty, just show up and represent New York.  We're looking embarrassing at this point.  Come on, girls.  Once again, 16 girls from Philly, 8 girls from New York so far in the Naughty Nighty contest.  Okay?  Come on, ladies.  Let's see what else.  Oh, Steve-O from Jackass coming in in about a half hour.  Yeah.  And he's going to do some sick stuff for us.  Also, we have a desperate FU message.  Your guy wants to try to get his girlfriend back.  For any kids listening, get ready with all the materials you're going to need to do exactly what Steve-O does. 
[00:30:00]  Right.  You could do it at home, too, kids.  No disclaimers on this program.  And Gay Kandahar.  Yeah, who knew?  Gay Kandahar.  Details on the way.  You're not going to believe what they're doing in Kandahar.  Now that they're free again.  Yes.  All right.  What's Dr. Jekylland doing?  He's talking to Patty today at an evaluation about his feet.  Is his name really Jack-alone?  Yes, it is.  Yeah, it is.  I remember him showing us a licensed job. 
[00:30:30]  Jack-alone.  Hey, Doc.  What's going on?  Dr. Crank it yourself.  Hey.  How are you?  Pretty good.  I have Patty here with me.  What do you think, Dr. Norton?  Do you have Patty there?  Yeah, she's actually in my office right now.  Do you have some time?  Sure.  Absolutely.  All right.  Maybe we can take a break and then we'll pop him up.  Yeah, what are you doing today?  Just looking over those feet?  Yeah, we're just taking a look at them.  I took an x-ray.  We're going to develop that in a little bit.  And basically what I was telling her, she's going to have to have this done in the hospital.  And she's probably going to miss a little bit of work. 
[00:31:00]  Hey, isn't this a procedure, though, that you usually do in the office and it doesn't take long?  No.  Well, if it's just a toe it is, but Patty's got some nice bunions there and those really  need to be done.  Bunions?  Her feet go on a right degree angle.  Yeah, it's really nasty.  It's pretty bad, right?  Can't you just, hey, dude, cut off her feet?  No.  We're going to try and avoid that at all costs.  All right.  We'll check in with you in a little bit after you look over her feet, okay?  All right, guys.  And check the x-rays.  Thanks a lot.  It'll be fun to watch her wobble in on her stumps.  Push her over. 
[00:31:30]  All right.  We have lots to do.  It's obvious.  So why don't we take a quick break?  Scott Farrell is up next.  If we can find him, he's been hiding ever since his show this morning.  I'm drinking it to Hard Rock.  I was listening.  Boston was calling him like crazy and the rest of Boston couldn't hear, you know.  Oh, I know.  The rest of Boston can't hear because they're not syndicated in the morning, but they knew  enough to call up and give him hell.  And they did give him hell all morning long.  It was very fun to listen to.  And now it's your chance, Boston, to call him up and bitch him out and have the rest of your  fine city hear it.  There you go. 
[00:32:00]  Boston, give us a call now.  866-277-4WOW.  Hi, this is Ozzy Osbourne and I'll see you at the 9th.  I thought I forgot what year I was in there.

We're back with the O.B. and Anthony show.  Hello.  Scott Farrell standing by.  I just got to talk to this guy in Washington real fast.  Dan, what's going on?  Hey, I took that chick over to JFK here in D.C.  I'm one of the four people listening to you here.  Oh, cool.  Love the show, too.  So you went down to the station with the girl that wanted to be in the Naughty 90 contest  in Washington.  Yeah, I mean, well, we got there probably about, I don't know, 6.30 
[00:34:00]  and they were looking at us like a deer in headlights, man.  I was like, you know, I got her here for the O&A 90 Naughty Contest.  This one girl was like, the what?  Hang on, let me get my boss.  And we sat there until about, I don't know, like 7.15 when he finally started taking pictures  and he said that they were supposed to be up sometime today.  So pictures were taken?  Yeah, man, yeah, she's hot, dude.  Well, no one mailed them to us yet.  Oh, nice.  All right, well, hopefully we'll get to see her.  What's her name?  Megan. 
[00:34:30]  Megan?  Megan, yeah.  All right.  She's a hot little brown-skinned South African.  Nice and mixed.  Nice, creamy, creamy construction.  All right, Ben, we'll get to the bottom of it and see what's going on with that.  All right, guys, I love your show, man.  Thank you, Dan.  See you.  All right, let's get this over with.  Scott Farrell.  I did a chick that looked like that.  Yeah?  Yeah, and I dig those pictures that you put up of all those hotties nude on the sofa.  When I go to work in the morning, I always have to swab off the mics, and then I go and  check for stains on the new furniture. 
[00:35:00]  Yeah, I love your furniture.  Dude, I love those gap shots you guys got going.  I got to start some of that perv stuff, too, man.  It's getting me going.  Every time I go in there, I have more fun doing that than even my own gig.  There's nothing wrong with perv stuff.  Dude, people have been waiting all day to talk to you in Boston.  Dude, the size of my rep and so much abuse in my life, I have taken such a beating that  I owe, you wouldn't even believe.  Like, I have to wear clothes.  I got to run nude near a river.  I have to, uh, I'm taking a fat chick to an NBA game. 
[00:35:30]  I'm, I had some chick with rickets.  I have to spend 24 hours with her family and her five kids.  I've lost more bets.  I lost two dimes on the game.  How many times?  I've lost hair.  I've lost fingernails.  I got kicked in the head.  God almighty.  Thank God the Eagles covered for me or I'd be broke eating soup this week.  I knew you would take that bet.  I had, but, you know, I was stupid because, I don't know, Jack, all I know is I still hate  everybody.  That is funny. 
[00:36:00]  How many bets did you make with the Boston people?  Oh, I didn't.  I made most of the bets with, uh, people from New York.  But this morning I got just driven like, uh, dude, I was kidnapped today.  I mean, I had every other call was from Boston.  I've never heard so much hate in all my life.  I actually got turned on by it.  I left there in a foul mood.  It was great.  I got into an argument with some people at work.  I was like, nobody that I work with, but I was just like, people were in my face all  day.  I had people starting up with me.  I got back to the Hotel California. 
[00:36:30]  Some guy said I owed him a C note.  I didn't even remember making that bet.  I went to the bank.  They told me I had a, I made a couple mistakes in my account and I was sitting there.  I don't know who I'm losing money to at this point.  When the doorbell rings now, I just don't even answer.  It was hilarious because I was listening to your whole show this morning and people calling  from Boston just to make fun of you and they can't even hear themselves on the air.  Their friends can't hear them making fun of you.  It was classic.  Rattle off all the calls.  You got a bunch of freaks from Boston.  I'll take the, all I know is this.  When I watched the game, it reminded me of, um, Neil O'Donnell watching Cordell Stewart 
[00:37:00]  with his lumps on his face, throwing, uh, just bread basket picks.  It's like, you stupid idiot.  When I watched him, I swear to God, the second interception in the fourth.  I bent over and grabbed my knees and I just said to myself, dude, you blow, you blow and  get out of here.  Don't even play again in Pittsburgh.  You're a receiver at best.  Go back to Boulder and start over.  Those were worse than Neil O'Donnell's interceptions in the Super Bowl to Larry Brown, which I thought 
[00:37:30]  was fixed.  This game here, I mean, all, I guess all you had to do was have Belichick, uh, with the  three, four defense, shut him down.  I thought Bledsoe was the difference.  It was funny.  I was in a bar in New York getting loaded watching the game.  And the minute I was sitting there with all of these dudes, and they know me well, it's  the only place I can go without getting in a fight.  I sat there and literally, uh, I said, watch Brady get his leg broken and Bledsoe wins the  game for him.  Five minutes later, Bledsoe's in the game.  Everybody in the bar's cheering. 
[00:38:00]  And then the next thing you know, he threw the floater.  I thought the best play of the game was when it was 3rd and 11 and he did the floater off  his right hand to the, uh, to Brown.  That was a great pass.  Oh my God.  Every time they had a 3rd and 3 or a 3rd and 11 or a 3rd and 8, he came through for  him.  I think he deserves free hummers and a new caddy.  And then he was, and then he was, he did the job.  But talk about, you know, Neil Young, Russ never sleeps.  He was crying at the end of the game, you know, is that?  Oh God, everybody's crying.  Got all teary-eyed. 
[00:38:30]  All I know is that Pittsburgh Coy, if they suck ass, the letdowns continue.  Whether it was Plummer knocking the ball down in 95 for the Chargers.  Whether it was 97, I was at the game doing the MTV bit.  We started fires out in the parking lot.  Then they got whacked by the Broncos and Romanowski.  And then watching yesterday, Christ, I almost went game.  Thank God I like hockey.  I swear to God, I'll never root for him again, the bastards.  I put my Steeler jacket away.  I took my terrible towel and took a dookie on it. 
[00:39:00]  And I'm sick of it.  I can't take any more of it.  I swear to God, this morning I said I was going to root for the Houston Texans from now on.  How about Philly, though?  They were two inches away from the Super Bowl.  They blow, too.  Everybody from Pittsburgh and Philadelphia did some kind of herpes.  They blocked that punt.  You're talking Eagles, Pats, and the Super Bowl.  Look, if the Steelers don't give up a 60-yard field goal block for a touchdown on a lateral,  I thought I was watching Deion Sanders play football again.  And then to boot, they give up a 75-yard, whatever it was. 
[00:39:30]  Troy Brown looked like the second coming of Jerry Rice.  Let's face it, I'm not stupid.  I watched the game, and the Patriots kicked their ass from the minute the game started.  They shut them down.  I knew at the end of the first one, it was 7-3 or whatever, that it was going to be all over.  Even in the third quarter, they had 14, but they never did anything with it.  If they had so much momentum, I would have kicked the ball down and tried to take somebody's eyes out,  stick your thumb in their eyes, and they played dirty.  Instead, they did everything that they weren't used to doing. 
[00:40:00]  Like, how about this?  Anthony Davis sweeps with Jerome Bettis going right.  He's still fat to run right.  He's a north-south runner.  He played like a pussy.  They should have had zero way in the game.  That's classic.  The fact that the Patriots did everything right.  Antoine Smith was hard to bring down.  I thought their offensive line played like pimps.  They were just protecting their trim, if you will, taking care of the neighborhood.  They played the best game feasible.  I didn't think the defense did a whole lot.  I thought that the Steelers just stopped being creative. 
[00:40:30]  They did nothing.  They threw screen plays that gained two yards.  The thing I didn't like about the game, and I don't blame any of it on officiating at all,  I think the Patriots deserve to go to the Super Bowl.  I'm going to root for them while I'm drinking scotch all day.  I hate the NFC.  But the fact is this, any football game that takes six hours to play, I say the NFL sucks.  Get rid of instant replay.  Every single time they went to that stupid camera, the play was never, they never did anything with it.  Now the refs are getting all, the officials, they're getting all creative with their speeches. 
[00:41:00]  Christ, it takes seven minutes every time they do it.  By the time it's over, the other game finally just started without them.  They were like, we're changing their diapers.  I turn over to Fox, it's like, whoa, wait, game started.  Well, they're like, screw it, we're not waiting anymore for this game.  You know why?  It's because the NFL's turned it into a, not just an instant replay league, but a television timeout league.  They make so much money selling commercial time in the playoffs that the game now takes six hours.  It's like going to a baseball game and watching these guys scratch their package all day, spitting, 
[00:41:30]  and it takes five hours to play nine innings.  When I was a little kid, the games used to be two and a half hours, tops, and pitchers used to throw strikes, change speeds, use your defense.  Now it's like, see how long I can stand out on the mound and get endorsement deals and see how good looking I am.  Look at Kerry Lightenberg, the guy from the Braves.  How many different hairdos can this fag have in one season?  You know, the whole thing has just gotten to the point where, like watching an NFL game,  if you stand at the game and you're at a game drinking beer, 
[00:42:00]  name one Giant or Jet fan or even Patriot fan up at that high school stadium they played in,  you ask one of them that didn't think it sucks to watch these guys stand around in TV timeouts for ten minutes at a clip,  and they do it the whole game.  They don't even play football anymore.  There's three and out, 12 commercials, three and out, uh-oh, reversal, instant replay,  watching an NFL game now.  Christ, I'd rather go to a funeral.  All right, Pharrell, Boston's standing by you.  Go ahead, you sissies.  Let's, uh, let's go to Kenny. 
[00:42:30]  Go ahead.  Kenny, live in Boston.  I hate you.  Scott Pharrell.  What's up?  Go ahead and hate me all you want.  My bank account is drained as we speak by large, fat mafia dudes.  I don't hate you.  I knew the Pats are going to win anyway.  God damn it.  They didn't win it and take it by name.  I figured everybody in Boston was dancing and cursing my name  and throwing shot glasses against the wall at my picture.  I just got one question.  How many odd gallons of spooch do you have to drink to get your voice like that?  Christ, dude, I have to drink like 40 of those in the morning. 
[00:43:00]  You've got to love that salty protein.  You're probably used to it with your ugly fat girlfriend.  Shut up.  At least come up with something creative.  I have people constantly calling me going,  does your mom bend over when she does it?  No, she's dead, you fag.  All right, let's go to Bruno.  Bruno, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey, Farrell.  Thank God.  I know we're going to drink in Boston.  Hey, I got the entire city.  Yeah, I can't wait to see you guys.  Come on down to my party on Long Island this Sunday. 
[00:43:30]  It should be real fun.  How's the football over in New York, huh?  We don't play football in New York.  We don't play football in New York.  We don't play a piece of bodies.  We throw them into the river here.  We don't have no water.  We don't shower you someday.  Get rid of our problems the easy way we burn them.  Wow, he doesn't like you.  Yeah, let's go to Lee.  Lee, what's up?  Hey, what's up?  Hey, brother.  Hey, Farrell, this is just coming straight from the past, fans.  Ha-ha.  Isn't that funny and creative? 
[00:44:00]  Right.  I hope you guys win so you finally have a title.  If it wasn't for Larry Bird, you fems wouldn't have anything in your lives.  You'd have three generations of family members going through school, marriage, and death before they've won anything.  The Red Sox are so bunk.  I'll have to take my buddy from Georgia Tech to get and do it at bat.  Nomar Garcia-Para takes 45 minutes in between every swing, and then what do you do?  Sit the whole year like that Fem J. Payton for the Mets.  All those guys are going to Georgia Tech at 500 in college, and then they spend their whole careers injured. 
[00:44:30]  Christ.  Play a game and then be called a Hall of Famer.  Nomar's a Hall of Famer.  My ass.  All right, let's go to Jimmy.  Jimmy, what's up?  Hey, guys, what's up?  Hey, Jimmy, you're on with Scott Pharrell.  Go ahead.  Last time, you said twice that the Pats are going to lose.  Now they're in the Super Bowl.  You said I'm not going to cut against them ever again.  I told you I'm going to root for them and do fat kicks.  Is that enough for you? 
[00:45:00]  I don't like that Jesus toting Kurt Warner either.  I hope his wife gets in a car wreck.  All right.  Tim, what's up?  Tim, you're on with Scott Pharrell.  I just want to say, Jesus, a fool for the love.  What's he going to do when he loses to the Patriots?  I just want to play in Jesus.  I just want to play in Jesus.  I just want to play in Jesus.  I just want to play in Jesus.  Tim, go ahead.  Hey, Pharrell.  My ass is so loud right now.  It hurts.  I woke up in a good course for the school. 
[00:45:30]  It was killing me.  Wait, Pharrell.  Let him talk.  Go ahead, Tim.  Hey, I got a nice big plate of crow for you to eat because you can't pick crap.  Yeah, well, I hit the other game, you douchebag.  Yeah, well, not by much, buddy.  Hey, thank God I had the wild and the devil's a tutu with a hook.  Otherwise, I swear to God, dude, I'd be borrowing meals.  Tom, what's up?  You're on with Scott Pharrell.  Hey, what's up, Pharrell?  Dude, I've been using it.  At least you're taking it like a man.  You know, you admit when you're wrong. 
[00:46:00]  I got to respect you for that, bro.  Dude, I took it hard.  This is the worst thing ever for me because not only, I don't care about, like, I've always  gotten along with the fans, and I dig it.  It's the constant bleeding now.  Now I know what it's like to be from Boston.  You guys get douche so much by the Yankees and by everybody else.  You've never had any happiness in your life.  Now for the last three times that these fans have been into the football class, they go  to the championship game, and they take it rectally. 
[00:46:30]  The Steelers, for me now, all I can think of them when I think of everything they've  done is blood pressure, heart attack, stroke, and foul language.  Every time I watch them, all I do is get disappointed.  I swear to God, between the instant replay and watching my team take it hard in the mouth  and ass, I just can't take it anymore.  I swear to God, I'm going to start going to ballerina classes.  Let's go to anything.  Poems.  What do they do, stand-up poems down in the village?  Yeah, you can do that.  Let's go to Johnny Lumber.  Johnny Lumber, what's up?  What's up on any of you guys' room? 
[00:47:00]  All right, you're on with Scott Pharrell.  Hey, Pharrell, first of all, one little comment.  For you to even say that we're throwing drinks at a picture of you is pretty pompous, because  we don't even know what you look like.  I am pompous.  I'm as pretty as a girl.  You are a little girl.  That's how you got that voice, too.  What'd you do?  Whatever.  If you did my voice, I threw you and your family.  How do you get that voice?  You got to get to all of your teams, don't you?  Smoking Marlboro Reds for 20 years and fat spleafs.  Let me ask you a question.  You analyze football games?  I analyzed your sister today when she was visiting me.  Stay away from me. 
[00:47:30]  Oh, that's pretty funny.  I spelled her up.  She was flat as your other teams.  Wow.  Brian, what's up?  Hey, I just want to send an F you up.  What's your fault?  Glad that got on the air.  Yeah, that's a make-up, bro.  Hey, nothing worse than what I heard here at the bar as I was leaving.  I get just abused wherever I go.  I get attacked in bars.  I get people throwing punches at me.  I get bottles whipped in my head.  I see no chips.  At least the hookers know how to treat me well. 
[00:48:00]  All right, hold on.  Keith has a problem with you.  Hey, hey, Pharrell, listen to me, you scumbag.  Here's your scumbag, you fat-lip bitch.  I'm douchebag.  Is it true you're going to pee sitting down?  Here you go, Flick.  You poor me, don't use it.  Is that your scumbag?  Everything you call, do I pee sitting down?  You know who it is, hand-job?  I pee sitting down and you drink it, bitch.  You're laying underneath me drinking it, you ugly bitch.  You keep running your mouth, son, man.  Go ahead, you like a cold-lip bitch.  I got some stickers for you.  Right behind that mic. 
[00:48:30]  Go ahead.  They love him.  Wow, Pharrell.  Trying to find me.  That guy likes you.  I'll dance with that dude.  That guy follows me around.  The police are watching him.  I know exactly who he is.  He can't stop listening to you or me.  Every day, that's all he does.  He's an unemployed femme that sits around threatening me.  And it's so funny to see what's going to happen to him.  I got news for you, douchebag.  You're going to be in for a shock when they start beating you over the head with a club.  And they say my name and say, this is from Pharrell. 
[00:49:00]  Go ahead.  How do you like it in the butt?  Remember that guy with the big plunger?  They got some tricks up their sleeves, the NYPD.  They'll go in and take your eye out.  All right.  Let's get a couple more and then we'll move on.  Fem's tied up in Boston.  What do you have, trolley cars?  Eric, what's up?  Hey.  Hey.  I just got a question for...  Hey, wait.  Go down.  Dine.  Where you going?  Over to the park?  Hey, how'd you do your show this morning with your foot in your mouth, pal?  I did it with my foot in your ass.  It sounds like you've been eating a lot of food. 
[00:49:30]  And I'm in the middle of the park all day.  I don't worry about you.  Life.  No more.  No more.  Another day.  Another day.  Another day.  Do-do-do-do-do-do.  Do-do-do-do.  So what?  I even did an old man's hog.  So what?  So what?  Yeah, I did a schoolgirl.  So what?  So what?  I've been to Brighton.  I've been to Easton.  And I don't care.  So what?  All right.  One more.  Tony, what's up?  Pharrell, what's worse, the sound of your voice or the crap you spew out? 
[00:50:00]  I think the crap that I spew out sometimes gets me in more trouble than my voice.  I hate my voice.  No, sexy.  Don't you want to lick me?  Go ahead.  All right.  You guys have a lousy day.  Pharrell.  I'm going to go wipe out.  Hey, Pharrell.  What?  What do you think now, the Rams and the Pats?  I just can't stand all those prayers and Jesus freaks and that fat boob owner of theirs. 
[00:50:30]  It kills you that you got...  And their big lips.  I got my tailfinger ring.  I got something for your ring, you old bitch.  Al Davis nude on top of you.  Hey, now.  It kills you that you got to root for the Pats, huh?  I'm going to root for that.  I'm wearing a Bledsoe jersey.  I'm going to wear underwear that says Patriots.  They're going to hang me at halftime.  I got to stay in a noose for about 30 minutes.  I think I can handle it with this voice.  Right on, man.  Have a lousy day, boys.  Thank you, Bo. 
[00:51:00]  All right, man.  There you go.  Scott Pharrell.  Boy, he's taking it hard.  I think you made a few friends today.  Check out Pharrell in the morning, Sierra.  In New York, he's doing a great job.  Yeah.  I wonder how much more time we got with him before he just completely ruins it.  All right.  Is Steve-O here yet?  Steve-O's here.  Oh, good.  We'll talk to Steve-O from Jackass next.  Nice.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  1027 WNEW. 
[00:51:30]  Yeah, we're back with the Opie and Anthony Show in the New York area.  877-692-1027.  Anywhere else, including Boston today.  Bastard.  You know why.  866-277-4-WOW.  That's 866-277-4-WOW.  Tim, you're next on the Opie and Anthony Show.  What's going on today?  Hey, boys.  What's up, man?  I just wanted to call real quick and say, thank the Lord for syndication, man.  I've got to tell you, I whacked my yam bag until I bled this weekend looking at those girls from Philly. 
[00:52:00]  That's what the Lord wants you to do.  That's good.  I'm telling you, it'd make your contest so much better, man.  Those girls from Philly really showed up in New York pretty hard, man.  A lot of people bitched when we syndicated the show.  That's what I'm saying.  There's definitely positives to being syndicated.  Look at all the talent.  That's all I'm saying.  Just one look at those, WNEW.com.  Look at your contest, what it's got to offer, and syndication.  Yeah, great input of all the new quim. 
[00:52:30]  It's nice, isn't it?  It's very nice.  Thanks a lot, boys.  Keep it going.  Yeah, check out the contestants in the Naughty Nighty contest at opieandanthony.com.  Keep it up.  Norton rules.  I'm hearing rumors that we have four more girls that have gotten their pictures taken in Cleveland.  Cleveland?  And they should be up hopefully later on in the show.  I'm hearing that another girl in Buffalo.  If Cleveland has four more girls, they would be tied with New York as far as representation.  There you go.  New York so far, we've had eight girls come by for the Naughty Nighty contest. 
[00:53:00]  Philly, way to lead.  16 girls showed up when we were there Friday.  So, yeah, you could qualify all this week.  So, ladies, if you're in the area in New York, come on down with your Naughty Nighty, man.  Yep.  Get in on the contest.  It's easy.  All right?  All right.  Steve-O's here, man.  Yeah.  I was just looking at the DVD.  He's hammered.  Is he?  He's been partying all day.  Cool, man.  He's had a lot of interviews and shows to do today, and he's been partying ever since.  Very busy, man.  Steve-O! 
[00:53:30]  Yeah.  He was answering the speaker.  Yeah.  Steve-O, what's up, man?  Hey, Steve-O.  How you doing?  I'm going to say right off the bat, my favorite jackass right here, Steve-O.  Cool, man.  Yeah.  You effing made that show.  Wow.  I see where this is going.  Look at you, man.  You're hammered.  I don't know, man.  Don't give me too much props.  I'm an idiot.  Well, that's why it works, you know?  I think you're a role model. 
[00:54:00]  Oh, wow.  Now we're in a whole new world of problems.  For the children.  Sounds a lot.  Do you just want to smack parents in the face when they give you grief?  Like, my goal at this point is to provide entertainment for all those who are over the age of 18.  Where do you go?  If you can't parent, man, if you can't take care of your kids and let them know they're doing stuff, it's going to F you up.  You know?  And then they blame it on you guys.  It's not like I get away with it. 
[00:54:30]  Yeah, right?  You get injured.  Jesus Christ, I'm looking at some of the stuff on this tape, though.  I see fire.  Yeah, that...  Fire's always good.  You're promoting the DVD and the VHS, Don't Try This at Home, the Steve-O video.  And basically, it's bonus stuff that they wouldn't air on MTV, right?  It's, um...  Yeah, I mean, like, the way it worked out when the show first got picked up, they said, hey, you know, it's great.  The pilot got picked up.  You know, we're coming out. 
[00:55:00]  You know, get ready to film this entire season full of new episodes.  And it's going to be awesome.  And while you're waiting to film, send everything you have.  So I had to compile all my video footage that I had and send it all in so that it could be go...  Like, they could go through it and acquire certain things.  And not one damn clip made it.  Really?  Literally, like...  For, like, there are different reasons why, like, some stuff didn't make it on, like...  Like, what's some of the stuff that didn't make it to the MTV show?  Um, yeah, they don't like fire that much, like... 
[00:55:30]  They don't like fire ever since that Beavis and Butthead thing.  Yeah, they had a problem with that.  Cartoon characters making kids start fires.  Yeah, I mean, in their defense, I mean, like, they're really just using common sense, which is my problem for not really using it.  Oh, screw common sense, man.  Right.  Well, I see, uh...  You should explain some of the things over here that people can see if they pick up this DVD.  Yeah, um...  That's funny, like, what...  It looks like you're jumping off a roof at a hotel into a pool.  Yeah, that's the one-legged double front flip off the three-story building. 
[00:56:00]  Nice.  What's going on with you, like, hanging out of the car window?  Oh, that's us blowing up artillery shells in my car as we drive it through the parking lot.  And MTV didn't want to show it.  I can't wait to check out this DVD.  Artillery.  And then you're eating something off a skewer.  It looks like it might be a rat or a pigeon or something.  Yeah, that's a barbecued squirrel.  A barbecued squirrel.  Oh, God damn. 
[00:56:30]  Which was an absolute joy compared to the steamed muskrat.  Right.  Steamed.  Make it even worse.  And then you're doing a skateboard trick where they're just blowing fire at you.  No, that's me clobbering my buddy, Ryan Simonetti.  Oh, okay.  Oh, you're blowing the fire there?  Yeah.  It's kind of hard to say in this stuff.  As much as I love skateboarding, I'm simply not capable of what that man can do.  And it also says this DVD contains the bonus video, The Career Ender.  Yeah, that's where we're going to run into a lot of problems pretty soon. 
[00:57:00]  Why?  It's just trash, man.  I mean...  What is it?  It stands zero chance of going retail.  Or, like, even promoting it to begin with isn't out on just about every darn network we're trying to run commercials on.  Really?  Well, we'll promote it here for you.  I'm not even alluding to what it is to begin with without even admitting to how bad the reality is. 
[00:57:30]  Can you allude to it a little bit?  Yeah.  For some reason, I have a problem with that word here.  Oh, do they?  I'm sorry.  I don't understand why.  There's a lot of...  There's a lot of...  Jackin'.  Yeah, there's a lot of jackin'.  I thought the words that you can find in the dictionary are all pretty cool.  You would think.  You would think.  All right, well, I pleased myself, Fonzie, my boss's...  Put it this way.  There is...  There is uncooling MTV around here.  You jacked it on the boss's desk?  Well, yeah, well, I mean, not the production coordinator. 
[00:58:00]  Like, someone distinctly higher up the chain than myself.  Right.  Yeah.  Someone very unhappy with my actions.  We had a guy have anal with his girlfriend on our boss's couch.  Oh, right on.  Yeah.  And then the guy got fired.  Didn't like that.  He's legendary, though, for that.  Did not enjoy that.  Yeah, it's just...  Like, the career runner is just a lot of wiener.  Oh, really?  Yeah, like, I mean...  Yeah, Rick will like it.  I'm stapling my nutsack to my legs and stuff.  Right.  Come on, Rick.  I'm kidding. 
[00:58:30]  Jesus.  I apologize for that.  That's very true.  So, yeah, guys.  I got here, let's see, yesterday?  Yeah.  To be honest...  Where are you from originally?  I grew up in, like, five different countries.  Really?  To be honest, yeah.  Like, I mean, I'm not even messing with you.  I most recently moved from Florida to California about a year ago.  Mm-hmm.  And it's been nuts.  I've been on the road pretty much the whole time.  It looks like you've been partying all day.  Oh, my Lord, please.  At least give me it since yesterday. 
[00:59:00]  Let's go to the phones.  Everyone wants to talk to Steve-O.  Jeff, what's up?  Yo, Steve-O, remember when you were filming with Brad Pitt not too long ago?  Yeah, absolutely.  Funny, man.  I heard you guys were burning joints like crazy.  Nah, nah.  Like, I wish, and I don't doubt the possibility.  We just didn't have that much time on our hands.  The kidnapping of Brad Pitt.  Yeah, how cool is that?  It is so cool.  Goddamn funny.  How did that come about?  It's crazy, too, because, like, the actual DVD that I'm here promoting right now,  at the time when we filmed that with Brad Pitt, 
[00:59:30]  I had a seven-minute-long promo of, like, you know,  this sort of, like, how do you feel about this project kind of promo.  And he watched it, and when it was over, he just looked at me and said,  dude, you're out of my league, man.  Let's go do some stunts.  You know?  It was just, like, so crazy, and everything you hear about him,  it's like, he's just not cool with being more special than anyone.  Really?  That's just really close to us.  That's pretty cool.  The kidnapping, though, man.  You guys drove up in front of a movie theater.  Brad Pitt's, like, online. 
[01:00:00]  He made it very distinctly clear that he had no real wish for us to go easy on him at all.  You know?  Like, he wanted, like, sort of leaning towards, like, more physical.  I like the people on the cell phones, though.  Like, they see it's Brad Pitt on the line.  They're like, oh, my God, it's Brad Pitt.  A van comes screaming up.  You maniacs jump out, grab him, throw him in the van, and drive away.  And then the camera's there taping the people online, calling up the cops and stuff.  Brad Pitt's just been kidnapped in front of the movie.  They're looking like complete asses.  The most seriously half-motivated crew of people you've ever found outside. 
[01:00:30]  Yeah, they really were going to help him.  That's classic.  Hey, Ray, what's going on?  Steve-O, you sick F.  Yeah.  Dude, do you make good money while you're doing this?  Hey, buddy, it's not about the money, man.  It's about the meat socket.  You're sick.  You guys suck.  The meat socket.  Thank you, man.  I appreciate it.  What were you doing?  Like, obviously, we all grew up and did, like, sick stuff when you were a kid. 
[01:01:00]  You know, you just didn't stop.  What the hell were some of the first things you did when you were a lot younger?  Um, well...  I know the mandatory bicycle over the ramp thing was big.  Yeah, I don't want to give you guys the mandatory sort of stuff.  No, I'm just curious, man, you know, because I did some pretty twisted stuff, but not, you know, after I could break stuff.  Like, um, I remember, uh, in fifth grade, ripping out a tooth that wasn't quite ready to get out of class.  See, that's, that's, that's, that's going to distance, man. 
[01:01:30]  That's much cooler than playing Evel Knievel.  I mean, you know, like, like, when you can tell it's going to go.  Yeah.  But it's not ready, so you know if you just rip it, it's going to bleed.  Teacher, look at this.  I got to go.  You know?  Wow.  All right, let's go to Matt.  Hey, Matt, you're next with Steve-O.  What's up?  Hey, guys, what's going on?  Hey.  Yo, I just had a question for Steve.  I recently saw the episode on MTV where he got his butt pierced.  Yeah.  And I was just wondering if there was any lasting effects from that, because it looked pretty damn painful. 
[01:02:00]  Well, compared to the infected industrial staple gun holes in my nutsack, it really wasn't that at all.  I also like your tattoo, the Your Name.  That's pretty, pretty innovative.  Hey, thank you.  I actually recently got the words, I have a small wiener tattooed on my arm.  Hey, what's the title of this DVD so I could go out and look for it?  It's called Don't Try This at Home, the Steve-O video. 
[01:02:30]  Is it out there yet?  It's out there.  I know there's a 1-800 number.  1-800, oh, man, you should have came up with an easy number, bro.  Oh, man.  1-800-263-8122.  We'll put that number up on our websites for you.  Or Steve-O video.com.  Or Steve-O video.com, that's right.  Yeah.  Yeah, and let's not turn your mom on to that.  All right, Matt.  Thanks, man.  Hey, thank you.  What was the most painful thing you did?  Man, it's all apples and oranges when you get down to it.  You know, like some pain, like, lasts.  When you got all the hair ripped out of your body, that had to be up there, man. 
[01:03:00]  The whole waxing episode, like, I mean, all the waxing put together, like, didn't hurt  nearly as bad as my feelings did having no damn eyebrows.  That was pretty bad.  I mean, like, that really, like, hurts a man's game, trying to cruise around with no eyebrows.  Yeah.  And to be honest, like, it's just so crazy.  Like, in this situation, I actually still scored.  No surprise.  Jonathan. 
[01:03:30]  Yeah.  Hey.  I just want to say, you know, I've been watching all the reruns on MTV lately, and I just want  to, Jackass, come back to MTV with no episodes?  At this point, like, the reruns are just, I suppose, just going to stay as reruns while  we work on Jackass the movie.  Oh, okay.  Which, uh.  What's that going to be about?  Heaven help me.  Is it going to be kind of like a documentary?  It's going to basically, like, sort of address the fact that we are a distinct liability, 
[01:04:00]  that as long as little kids are watching us do all this stuff that, um, you know, like,  people are going to be pissed.  And so, uh, we decided on just going ahead and making a movie that's rated R.  So if, uh, anybody under the age of whatever it is, you know, they just don't have to watch  it.  Right.  I mean, like, we're making an hour and a half long R-rated episode of Jackass that's just,  I mean, we're not really looking to, uh, you know, keep a dead horse alive or anything. 
[01:04:30]  We're just, we want to close the book and, with class.  Yeah.  What happened with MTV, though?  They finally had enough with the complaints coming in or what?  Uh, I don't know that, uh, there was just, like, a lot of, is that me?  Popular guy.  That's you, bro.  What the hell?  Hey, you're all right.  I'm sorry about that, guys.  Yeah, man, as far as, like, whatever happened, I don't know.  I wasn't really a part of it.  But, um, clearly, uh, clearly, I think there were second thoughts, like, wow, you know, 
[01:05:00]  maybe, uh, you know, maybe we might want to move this to a later time slot or something.  I don't know.  I mean, I'm not an authority.  Right.  Nick, what's going on?  Yo, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Steve-O, man.  The craziest one on Jackass by far.  Dude, I remember one episode where he was bobbing for jellyfish in the boat.  Oh, anyway, they don't like that word.  Okay.  Man, did I just say a variation of that word?  Yes.  The, uh, pee-pee.  What happened with that?  The variation's cool, but that one isn't for whatever reason.  That's what's so stupid about the rules.  Wow.  Again, just say, uh... 
[01:05:30]  The actual body, bodily fluid he's referring to contains ammonia.  There you go.  Yeah, which is the, uh, which is the claimed, um, whatever to help.  So what about that, Nick?  Oh, dude, that was crazy.  I mean, I remember, like, you know, you go swimming in the ocean, they're, like, telling you,  oh, watch out for the jellyfish, the paralysis.  This guy's sticking his head in a whole thing filled with jellyfish.  All right, I'm gonna, like, um, break it down.  Like, I didn't just decide, like...  I mean, everybody knows if you see a jellyfish, pretty much swim the other way. 
[01:06:00]  Right.  You know?  But, um, the way it aired was in a different order.  And, uh, the...  Did you see the episode where, um...  He's gone.  I strapped all the chopped up barracudas around, like, while swimming with the hammerhead sharks?  Yeah.  It was while we were swimming with the hammerheads that, um, like, I was just trying to pay attention  to all these 10-foot hammerhead sharks while this little tiny jellyfish sort of just nailed  me, you know?  I came up out of the water, like, oh, I just got my ass kicked by a jellyfish. 
[01:06:30]  And, um, got back in the boat.  We finished the hammerhead shoot.  And, um, I was like, wow, you know, that sucks.  But, I think I could handle a whole aquarium of it.  You know?  So, like, uh, it just came up by accident.  And I, uh, say, you know, like, if that's all, if that's all there is to it, you know,  let's do it.  What the hell are you going to do if one of those sharks would have just...  Because I saw that and I'm thinking, all right, there's no, there's no safety net here.  No, no, that's why you're wrong, buddy.  I had Manny. 
[01:07:00]  Manny Puig.  Yeah?  Oh, the shark guy, right?  Yeah, that's, that's right.  Yeah, but what the hell is he going to do if one of these things...  They decided they were just going to grab you.  I, I just trust the man.  Have you ever been scared by a stunt?  Oh, man, if I'm not scared by a stunt, what the hell, what the hell would I do it for?  Name one that where you're like, I don't know if I should do this.  Um, um, I mean, pretty much everything I do is...  Oh, really?  Have you ever said, have you ever said no to something?  Yeah, you, you can't duct tape me to a mechanical bull. 
[01:07:30]  They were going to do that?  Because at some point you just have to fall off, man.  Don't tape you to it.  You would have broke your neck, I think.  Yeah, probably.  Oh, wow.  And, uh, and let's, let's keep all that waxing business out of my butt crack.  That was funny.  Mark, what's up?  Yo.  Hey, bro.  I want to ask Steve-O where the hell I can pick up some of those, uh, leopard yambag show  or offers he always wears on every damn episode of BC.  Yeah, that's his trademark, I guess.  Man, um, you know, I need to literally put out my own line of these things to make them 
[01:08:00]  available to all the people who are, I mean, it's not about the cheetah print itself, it's  the double panel front that actually makes you look so big.  There you go.  I mean, trust me, like, I'm all balls.  Yeah, we noticed that, man.  Yeah.  I mean, I'm not, I'm not here to claim big wiener, but I also don't know where to get the, the  cheetah. 
[01:08:30]  All right.  Thanks, Mark.  All right, man.  You guys suck.  All right.  Let's go to Turkish.  Turkish, what's up?  Hey, Steve-O, you're the guy who keeps, like, beating up his dad, right?  Yeah, no, that's Bam.  No, that's Bam.  Bam, Bam's great on that show, too.  Oh, yeah.  You and Bam make jackass.  I had a horrible episode on too many hits of ecstasy where I forced myself on Bam's  dad trying to make out with him, but I wasn't violent, you know?  Hey, I got a question.  That's great.  Steve-O?  Yeah, go ahead.  Yeah, I wanted to know, like, what do you guys think of Johnny? 
[01:09:00]  Because he's like, because he's kind of acting like a diva, getting all the attention  in the media and stuff.  No, no, no, geez.  You know, like.  Well, you guys did all the real stunts on that show.  I mean, he was a good host, and you guys got him into some.  Interesting situations, but.  I'm so tired of hearing this, you know, like.  But it's true, man.  Well.  I'm not, you know.  Hey, all it takes is a little success.  You should give yourself some credit, because a lot of, a lot.  No, it's not about hate.  Hate a lot of people, you know.  From day one that I filmed on this show, Johnny Knoxville's had different movie deals 
[01:09:30]  that he's working on, you know, and like, like, each, like, huge movie contract that  he has requires him to not participate in dangerous behavior.  Well, yeah, but like, besides, like, you, like.  Every contract ends, and the day his contract's over, he's like, take me to the bull ring.  You know, I mean.  Literally, like, I don't know how people are overlooking the incredibly life-threatening  crap this man is doing, but he far exceeded whatever level of success.  Right.  You know, I mean, like, he just is engaging it by, he's just ready to do stunts. 
[01:10:00]  Yeah.  All right.  Max, what's up?  Yo, Steve-O, I've been a big fan since Poop, Boob, and number two.  Awesome, man.  That's what I want to hear.  Yeah, that stuff is absolutely excellent.  Absolutely excellent stuff.  And I wanted to congratulate you on all your idiot success.  Hell yeah, man.  And illegal street narcotics are your friend.  No, absolutely, man.  That dude, Bam, is absolutely insane.  I actually got to watch him skate in person a little while ago, and he's absolutely nuts  on the board as well as on the ridiculous videos. 
[01:10:30]  All right, Max.  Thank you.  I love Jim Norton.  Thank you.  Ignorant Norton.  Cool.  Hey, Steve-O, can we get you to do something today or what?  Oh, man, let's do it.  I'm so wasted.  I almost forgot I was going to do something.  Why don't we take a break here?  We'll come back with Steve-O, and he's going to do a little something.  I know we got to kill him.  I'm going to shed some blood.  You're going to shed some blood for us today?  That means this guy will be leaving the studio.  Ben can't handle that.  Steve-O from Jackass, he's in studio today. 
[01:11:00]  His new DVD, Don't Try This at Home, the Steve-O video, it looks great.  Just from those stupid pictures on the back.  Yeah, don't judge a book by its cover, buddy.  It's garbage.  And this DVD contains the bonus video, The Career Ender.  And you can get it by going to Steve-O.com or call 1-800-263-8122.  When we get back, Steve-O sheds some blood, as he says.  Yeah.  Doctor, you can imagine.  Has prepared you for this.  I don't want them enjoying it like exactly. 
[01:11:30]  Sometimes you want to hear.  Bye.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  And E.W.  We're back with The Opie and Anthony Show.  We're hanging with Steve-O from Jackass.  Promoting his new DVD, Don't Try This at Home, the Steve-O video.  This DVD contains the bonus video, The Career Ender.  You can go to Steve-O-Video.com or call 1-800-263-8122. 
[01:12:00]  We got that info up on FoundryMusic.com, our website.  No engine search will produce the name of my shady attorney.  And Steve-O's girlfriend is in the studio.  Does this work?  Yeah, that work.  Oh, yeah.  Am I working?  Yeah.  She's, um, she's, can we say what she's, can we say what she's popping?  My babe is so full of Xanax, she's virtually useless.  Virtually.  Well, she's been flashing and stuff.  And after the way I shared all my cocaine, eight Xanax just disappeared. 
[01:12:30]  I don't know what the hell.  Eight Xanax.  Wow.  She's got generic Xanax that, um...  I came from Costa Rica.  Yeah, I came from Costa Rica.  Your Xanax came from Costa Rica.  Our last night's calculations...  Where did those come from?  Our last night's calculations were that, um, they were about a quarter of a bar apiece.  Uh-huh.  And, um...  What's happening about them?  Actually, that was the night before last night.  God, we're on a binge. 
[01:13:00]  Your girlfriend is, uh, beautiful, Steve-o.  And she has, uh, very nice boobs that she's showing everybody.  Yeah, she really did keep them within reason.  I think I can actually lick one of them.  Wow, you can?  I mean...  Oh, yeah.  She did keep them within reason.  Yeah, she really did.  They look very natural.  They're not ridiculous big.  Yeah.  How big were they, uh, before?  Like, double A.  Really small?  Yeah, really small.  Wow.  It's that restraint.  It really shows ambition. 
[01:13:30]  Absolutely.  And she, uh, she told us that she's wearing a skirt for a top.  They look at me like they hate me.  What?  Oh, other girls look at you like they hate you?  It's because they do.  They do.  Yeah, girls will like that.  Very petty, very catty.  Yeah, you're beautiful.  She is, yeah.  How tall are you?  Like 5'3".  5'3"?  Hmm.  Just tall enough.  You know how catty it is out there?  I'm not catty at all.  She asked for a beer, and, uh, Mary goes,  Oh, don't take any of Anthony's beer.  Can I, can I say something I shouldn't? 
[01:14:00]  I asked her if I can't or kiss her.  She goes out with Henry Rollins, dude.  Yeah?  Drop it, drop it.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Oh, man.  He'll kick all ass.  All right, we're going to do a stunt right now.  I asked her, um, the girl who works with her if I could do a stunt and if I could kiss her.  How crazy is it?  I got Henry Rollins picking her up in my past.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  When you talk about a rock star, you don't want to meet in a dark alley.  I'll have an F with him, man.  But, hey, how's Henry?  Has he, like, beat the crap out of you or something? 
[01:14:30]  No, no.  He's a very gentle guy.  He is a nice guy, man.  Very sensitive.  We've had him on the show.  I've had sex with him before.  Good God.  Not by my choice.  Good God.  Let me, let me somehow convey my fear.  Oh, my God.  It would look like a scene out of Oz.  Forget about it.  Done.  All right, now.  You like Mary?  Yes.  Mary's nice.  I'm sorry, baby.  We're getting your, quote, prop.  Oh, awesome.  We're going to need, like, five more minutes.  So, Steve-O's going to do a couple things.  Steve-O, you like the tequila, man?  Yeah, I absolutely do. 
[01:15:00]  To be honest, like, I never really, like, enjoyed a smooth road to having any money.  Has one ever been presented to you?  I mean, like, I'm 27 years old and dropped out of college when I was 19, basically told  my parents, hey, it's going to be great.  Don't worry about it.  I'm pretty much getting into a van.  I'm driving to California.  I'm going to become a stuntman.  Oh, is that what your plan was? 
[01:15:30]  Stuntman?  Yeah, it just turned horribly sour, and I wound up having the government testing drugs on me.  What?  Following the Grateful Dead.  Wait, what's the government testing drugstore?  Were you on a guinea pig?  It was, yeah, it was a medical study.  Yeah, we did a whole show on that.  What were you chose?  I am probably, literally, I had the most dangerous study, like.  What did you do?  What did you do?  I had drugs for, like, tests on me so that they could become legal to be administered 
[01:16:00]  to pigs and cows.  Livestock drugs.  Literally, yeah.  Now, the goal being that, like, after the cattle gets all the drugs, their fat level goes  down, they have more muscle.  So, at the end of the day, it's leaner meat.  Right.  So, the people pay more money in the grocery store for the leaner meat.  Right.  Better meat for drugs.  And when they eat that meat, like, when they eat that meat, they've got, like, a minuscule  trace of the drug.  So, just for the simple fact that a trace of the drug is entering the human body. 
[01:16:30]  Shoot you up a huge amount.  There needs to be a study to find out how much the human body can withstand of this retarded  drug.  Holy Jesus.  How much?  How much?  They actually, like, um, I mean, it's not going to make sense to any of us, like, what  the drug itself is.  But, like, they would not stop giving it to us until someone in the study's resting heart  rate over past 150 beats a minute.  Oh, my God.  Resting.  And now, I'm going to tell you, my heart rate right now is probably pretty close to 150 
[01:17:00]  beats a minute.  But, but I'm in a much better mood than I was when I was in the study.  Cool.  Well, your girlfriend's naked over there.  Steve-O, what'd that pay you, man?  She's doing good.  Yeah, she's, she's good.  What'd that pay you?  That paid me $2,000 for 12 days.  Righteous bucks.  Now, that's the thing.  Like, if I, if I, if you're one who pays attention to medical studies, the key to this  is that there are no outpatient visits.  Because that's what they'll get you.  You can't even enjoy a doobie when you got to come back every weekend for two months straight. 
[01:17:30]  So it's just within the study period and then you're done.  It was 12 days in and out.  Ah.  12 days in and out.  No outpatient.  I mean.  Damn, that's twisted.  I mean, to be honest, like.  Did you say give me the most dangerous high-paying drug test that you had?  That was, like, that, like, we, we, uh, found the most dangerous high-paying drug test.  Drove from frickin' Colorado to Texas to get into it.  Classic.  Slept on a rooftop and we told him, hey, you know what, we're kind of thinking, like, you 
[01:18:00]  know, about getting into this.  What'd you spend the money on?  Oh, man.  Um, let's see, uh, we tried to buy a pound of marijuana a piece, my buddy and I.  More drugs.  But, uh, you know, we really got ripped off badly.  There was this whole bad episode and then I just started following the Grateful Dead.  That was it, huh?  You figured he'd, uh, latch on to the dead.  Yeah, this is, this is, this is some years back, you know what I mean?  Yeah.  You're, you're, wow.  But, my, my point was is that, uh, I've never had money to pay for my own drinks. 
[01:18:30]  No?  I walk into the bar and I'm pretty much ready to do something gnarly.  That guy.  All right.  Now, I know, I know a lot of people like that.  They don't have to pay for anything.  I got all different strategies and, you know, tricks to earn.  But, I knew the low-scale guys on Long Island that would, like, take the gold chain and  go, dude, I'll snort it in my nose, cough it out my mouth, hook it together and, like,  spin it around through my nose and mouth.  He did that with a worm.  Did he?  Yeah.  I did that with an earthworm.  He threw up.  Like, I don't get nauseous very easily, but I saw him, it's like, he snorted the worm up 
[01:19:00]  his nose and then, and then, out the mouth.  I'm not a proud man.  That's good.  So, here's the other, like, I often claim this as the mother of all bar tricks.  What?  Or an excuse to drink a lot of tequila right now.  Yeah.  Tequila.  You guys were nice enough to provide me with a nice big bottle of tequila.  Yeah.  And beer.  You got to, like, get your listeners, like, at least to trust that I've got a crazy pile  of salt on my hand.  Oh, they trust us. 
[01:19:30]  Yeah, we're filming.  Yeah.  You guys are awesome, but alcohol, that's, like...  Your girlfriend's babbling.  What?  No, like, that's so accommodating with alcohol.  I was begging for alcohol at the show earlier, and you would not give me any.  We will hook you up, baby.  You got as much booze as you need, man.  And if you need to, you can even go to the stairwell.  We have so much booze here.  Clutch booze is open.  At this show, we have everything.  Hey.  Hey, what is she...  She wants to do something, too. 
[01:20:00]  Don't worry, yeah, she's in there.  What do you want to do?  You want to...  I'll be still and be quiet.  But you want another girl or something?  Yeah, no, no.  We'll...  You're flirting with every girl that comes in here.  Trust me, Dean...  All right, go.  Dean might not know what's going on.  Be quiet.  No, who's saying leave?  We need her.  Rick?  No.  No, leave her in here, man.  All right, hold on.  Let's not let our ratings slip over here.  No, we're doing this.  It's fine.  All right, now, I'm teaching the listeners a stunt.  Okay, go ahead, Steve.  Now, like, when you put the salt on your hands for this tequila shot, 
[01:20:30]  we're not going for, like, a lickable amount of salt.  We're going for a mogul.  You know, like a pile of salt.  Big pile.  You see the pile.  Mountainous pile of salt.  Now, trust me, my nose is already clogged,  but the first step here, I went...  Oh, no.  Now...  You're kidding me, man.  Get your shot ready.  No.  Wait, you're tarted around salt.  You're going to snort the salt?  No, stop.  That's what I think he's going to do.  Rather than a little wedge, I'm going to go with the full half lime. 
[01:21:00]  A half a lime you have there.  He's got the tequila, the salt, and the lime,  but I think he's going to do it a little differently than you and I.  Okay.  All right, ladies and gentlemen, the tequila stuntman.  Oh, he just snorted the salt.  Oh, my God.  He's chugging the tequila.  All right, a little chug of the tequila.  All right.  He's taking off his glasses.  Get out of here.  Oh, my God.  He's squeezing...  The lime in the lime juice.  He's squeezing so much lime juice into his eyeballs. 
[01:21:30]  Get out of here, man.  Now, you find me a bartender that won't give me a beer for that.  You can't even open his eyes.  Plus, plus.  You have lime juice right in his eyes.  Imagine my pleasure when I go back over to that girl and say,  hey, remember I said I was going to go tell that bartender  he's going to give me a free shot of tequila  and give me a beer for drinking it.  It's a bet on the bet.  Yeah, man.  How much is that stinging right now?  He can't even open his eyes. 
[01:22:00]  Yeah, it's a nice one.  It never gets easier.  Oh, man.  My dad's telling me I shouldn't do it.  I'm like, Dad, dude, it's all natural, man.  Dude, I have squeezed a lime wedge into a Captain Morgan and Coke  and had one little drop go in your eye, and it kills you.  Look at the...  He can't open his eyes.  Steve-O's the real deal.  That is insane.  Let me see.  Let me see your eyes, man.  There we go.  One shot, Ryan.  Oh, my God.  That's great.  That is great.  It's a tequila stunt, man, dude. 
[01:22:30]  Wow.  That was impressive.  And then, you know, the pain doesn't last long because of the tequila.  That's good.  The tequila kind of helps you out with that, too.  Makes you not really care.  Yeah, you know what?  I just can't stand tequila to begin with until I do that trick.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Tequila is a commitment for the night of getting effed up.  You don't just drink that like a little cordial.  Can't we find a cooler word than eff?  Yeah.  Do I mean eff?  No, we can't.  I'm sorry.  I know.  I got to plug your crap for that, man. 
[01:23:00]  Don't try this at home.  The Steve-O video.  Go to stevovideo.com or call 1-800-263-8122.  Basically, all the stunts at MTV would not show, Anthony.  Yeah.  And we're going to link that to our websites as well because Steve-O is a very cool guy.  His girlfriend is real hot.  Oh, we got a light bulb?  Yeah.  Good Lord.  Hey, I noticed your video, your DVD.  It doesn't have even a word close to jackass on it.  Yeah.  How much did the lawyers battle that out that you couldn't tell? 
[01:23:30]  No, no, no, no.  It's just not.  Not even like your favorite jackasses.  You know, they kind of.  It's not in my interest to, you know.  I mean, it is what it is.  Yeah.  I mean, I'm basically, I'm basically like, not only is it not worth it to affiliate this  to MTV, I'm not even proud of it.  I mean.  That's beautiful.  Hey, I honestly, I'm like, the only thing, the only thing making me feel better about  this DVD is that I might be the only like recognizable person to deliberately ruin his 
[01:24:00]  career in one foul swoop like this.  You're going to sell a ton of these DVDs.  I mean, like, that's really like, I've learned, I've learned in my short time in the entertainment  industry, like, I've learned distinctly that there's nobody really looking out for me.  You know, like, nobody really cares.  Like, you're hot when you're hot. 
[01:24:30]  Yeah, that's good.  Yeah.  It's hot.  You know, I'm like.  That's true.  And I mean, to be honest, like, I didn't really ask for it to begin with.  You know, like, all I did was steal a video camera from my dad and just act ugly.  Just some crap.  And so it's like, hey, no one, like, no one's going to be on my team down the road.  So to hell with the road.  Pete, what's going on?  Hey, ONA, I want to request a really dangerous stunt for Steve-O.  Okay.  Have his girlfriend spell her name. 
[01:25:00]  Hey, hey, buddy.  Hey, buddy.  What's up?  Not only can she spell her name.  Wait, are you going to hear me spell my name?  Like, she's so talented that she's got a lot better things to be doing.  What's her name?  What's his name?  Pete.  Pete.  Name Schmame, baby.  Okay, try this one off her size.  D.  That a girl.  That's a keeper. 
[01:25:30]  It's pretty easy.  Hey, dude.  She's a keeper.  Her name's D.  Hey, dude.  Trust me, man.  Like, this girl is not here to spell for you.  What a tool.  Nah, nah, that guy's cool.  He's all right.  Didn't take any long to learn that.  He just...  I bet.  He's just...  He sounds like Goldie Long, doesn't she?  He's figured out what I'm looking for.  A little Goldie Hawn.  Yeah.  I love Goldie Hawn.  You like Goldie Hawn?  All right.  Sit down.  All right, Steve-O.  Wow. 
[01:26:00]  Goddamn Xanax.  I'm going to treat myself to a light bulb.  You're going to treat yourself...  I already stapled him once today.  Can I do more violence?  You want to do more violence?  We might have to test the staple ability of some of these office items to my 70s bush.  Oh, God damn.  We did bring an industrial staple gun.  Okay.  But first, I would like to be treated to a light bulb broken over my head.  All right. 
[01:26:30]  I mean, okay, now this is an important thing to me, too.  Because, I mean, I joke around.  I'm like, oh, you know...  I'm basically, like, not here to make the world a better place.  Right.  I just don't care to really help.  I'm not interested in hurting.  You just want to entertain it a little bit.  Yeah, I just want to make it sillier.  You know, like, people who have rough days, I want to be there in one form or another  to just take their mind off their crappy day.  There you go.  Hey, Kyle, thank God.  Kyle has a problem here.  Kyle, what's up? 
[01:27:00]  I was saying that tequila thing, you know, that's nothing.  It's called the man-shot.  I mean, my buddy's been doing that for years.  That's nothing?  Right on, dude.  Trust me, man.  It's just a party trick, dude.  That's the first time I've seen it.  It's a man-shot.  I'll tell you, it's something.  I'm a ham.  I can't help it.  All right.  Thank you, Kyle.  Don't be a hater.  That sounded to me like I had a fellow tequila stuntman on the line.  Yeah, there you go.  All right, don't be hating, dude.  It's a union, dude.  All right, like, let's join together.  Well, we see the light bulb in your hand.  Don't keep eating me, dude.  Let's just do it more. 
[01:27:30]  All right, what are you doing with the light bulb?  All right, well, I'm telling you that I literally had a bro.  Like, I graduated from Ringling Brothers Barnum and Billy Clown College.  No, you didn't.  I really did.  You did.  I really did.  Which is statistically harder to get into than Harvard.  Clown College.  Yeah, like, I told you I dropped out of college.  Like, university.  I dropped out when I was 19.  I said, it's going to be great.  I'm going to become a stuntman.  I didn't have a lot of success.  You know, I found out about Ringling Brothers Barnum and Billy Clown College. 
[01:28:00]  What was there about being a clown that you were like, yeah, this gig's for me?  It's so distinct what it was, is that all I had was a lot of video footage of me hurting myself.  And the only way that I thought that anybody would ever, like, actually, like, give me credit for hurting myself was if I somehow had Ringling Brothers on my resume.  Ah, I got you.  To sort of count it out.  Sort of the guy flying out of the cannon.  Yeah, like, yeah, there's a reason why this guy staples himself, you know?  I got you. 
[01:28:30]  Professional clown.  Right.  You know, I actually went on to work as a performing circus clown on Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines and in the Hannaford Family Circus.  It's like, I'm a real, like, circus performer.  That's when the light bulb trick came up.  Because this veteran circus clown who I worked on cruise ships with is telling me how he eats light bulbs.  And I said, hey, dude, you've got to teach me.  He's like, oh, you know.  Because circus people are really uptight, you know?  They don't, like, let their secrets out.  Right.  They don't even like regular people.  They're just antisocial.  That's true.  So, you know, this guy doesn't want to tell me. 
[01:29:00]  You did, did you?  What were you going to do in the circus?  I don't know, but I wanted to run away and join it.  Oh, baby.  So this guy says he doesn't want to teach me.  Oh, baby.  Yeah.  He says he doesn't want to teach me how to eat a light bulb.  And I said, well, hey, dude, if you don't teach me, I'm going to freaking do it anyway.  You want that in your conscience?  You know?  So I want him over at that point.  Right.  We're just watching your chick lick the microphone.  I'm sorry. 
[01:29:30]  Did you see that, Opie?  Yeah, your girlfriend's just licking the microphone.  She's licking and kissing the tip of the microphone.  God bless her.  God bless her.  God bless her.  You won't hear me scold her, dude.  Never.  Why?  You might hear me swig some tequila right now.  There you go.  All right, slamming more tequila.  All right, let's check out the light bulb.  All right, I'm at.  We're filming all this for foundrymusic.com, by the way.  Oh, my God.  You're going to bust it over his head.  I'm going to try to break the light bulb on my head with the tequila bottle. 
[01:30:00]  All right.  Sure, why not?  Tequila's going to go flying.  I'm going to play.  Oh, man.  That hurt?  That's hard, huh?  That hurt.  Ow.  I do it.  Oh!  We got ourselves a party.  Oh, my God.  Okay.  All right.  You're just pushing it over your head.  At the time when this veteran circus thought taught me that trick, that part wasn't in it.  Right.  That was a little improv you did.  Yeah, and I'm proud to let you know that I went on to spice the trick up a little more. 
[01:30:30]  Bravo.  Yeah.  So, you know, like, the only goal ever, like, for all, like, freak shows, side circus people,  they just eat a good potato chip-sized piece of glass.  Yeah.  All right, so you see I have it.  Right.  But they don't test to see how sharp it is.  Oh.  Oh, okay.  So, I'm going to shed blood. 
[01:31:00]  Not on your tongue.  Oh, yeah.  I would have done it on the forehead.  This is disgusting.  You're kidding me, right?  Oh!  Holy F!  Holy F!  Oh!  Holy!  Steve-O just took the shard of glass and just sliced his tongue.  Dude, you are completely insane.  Dude, you are insane.  It is dripping blood.  The blood is dripping right on the console.  We're filming it.  Oh, my God.  How long have I... 
[01:31:30]  He didn't just poke it.  We've established...  You didn't just poke it.  How long of a gas did he put?  It's at least two inches.  Two inches long.  He made an X on his tongue.  He made an X in his tongue.  He's spitting blood.  Oh, blood is just pouring out of his mouth.  And, like...  Oh!  All right.  All right, man.  So, it's sharp.  Yeah!  And it's glass.  And I'm drunk, and I'm going to eat it.  Look at your bloody teeth.  Look at his teeth.  They're all bloody.  Look at his bloody teeth.  All right, here we go.  All right.  Oh, my God.  Look at all the blood.  All right.  Bye, my God. 
[01:32:00]  Oh, oh, oh.  Perfect.  Holy Jesus.  I'm going to even watch this.  That rocks.  Now, hold on.  The key is in having it still be crunchy when I swallow it off.  Are you ready?  The tequila, which probably might...  Are we getting the crunch factor?  I'd sting your tongue a little bit.  All right.  Cheers, guys.  I'm glad to be here.  Wash it down with tequila.  More tequila.  On that tongue.  That's got to...  The tequila's got to burn the... 
[01:32:30]  The...  The...  The cut.  It's...  Yeah, it's really...  That's real.  Wow.  I almost swore it.  Yeah, I see you said F.  I almost said...  God.  Damn.  I'd rather get busted for going through with the whole word than abbreviating it.  Right on.  Yeah.  I mean, am I wrong?  No.  No, you're not.  I mean, like, by just saying the one letter, aren't we just drawing attention to the fact  that we're technically, like, on some sort of leash?  Of course.  In your...  It's because, yeah, you know...  It's a call for creativity. 
[01:33:00]  Is the tongue still bleeding?  Is...  Yeah.  I'm like...  I'm like...  I'm like...  I'm like...  I'm like...  I'm like...  I'm like...  It's really cool.  Now, the key is...  The key is, like...  I haven't...  Yeah?  What's the key?  He bleeds in life.  Oh, he's the shards of glass.  Yeah, I'm pulling shards of glass.  The...  The key is, um...  Nice.  The tongue is literally the fastest healing part of the body.  Oh, yeah?  Is that your gum?  Baby.  He didn't cut his gums.  He cut his tongue.  Yeah. 
[01:33:30]  I need a kiss later.  Aww.  See, that...  Like, that...  Like, it's true.  And, um...  Yeah.  What can I say?  I'm not here to take a move.  You've obviously done this before.  How long will that take for you?  Yeah, you know what?  You know the horrible truth is that I did it, like, pretty much every show on a 30-day  U.S. tour.  How long does that take to heal?  My tongue is very resilient to trauma.  The enamel on my teeth is about ready to call it quits.  I'm not kidding when I say that, like... 
[01:34:00]  Here I am right here.  You guys, um...  I don't even know if you've met him.  My gangster tour manager...  Yeah.  I don't know how much, like, we're really, like, delegated to say, but this DVD I'm promoting  right now...  Uh-huh.  Um...  Let's go ahead and say that we're not here to make MTV happy.  I mean...  Not that...  Not that I don't want to make them happy.  Ah, screw them.  It's just that...  No, I mean...  Well, this stuff needs to be shown on...  Yeah, I mean...  It's all the stunts they wouldn't show on MTV. 
[01:34:30]  Every reason that MTV has had for not showing this footage, I'm not criticizing them for  that.  I mean, it's a simple fact of them having taste that I somehow lack miserably.  Dude, stick your tongue out, man.  Let me see that.  Stick your tongue out over here.  Let me see.  Bobby already healed, dude.  Let me see.  It's a little bit...  It's a nice...  Yeah, it really is already...  I was eight years old. 
[01:35:00]  I don't know.  I was mischievous.  You're still chomping on the glass.  But, yeah...  Yeah, you're talking about your crunch.  Yeah.  That's the key.  You gotta have...  The crunch.  Yeah, like...  I didn't...  I didn't just decide, oh, wow, now I know how to eat a light bulb.  I'm gonna slash my tongue.  I remember it.  When I got all the secrets to the light bulb eating, I remember when I was eight years old,  and somehow just being in my parents' bathroom and licking... 
[01:35:30]  I mean, this is gonna sound funny, but it's true.  I licked...  I tried to lick toothpaste out of a Bic razor.  Oh.  Oh.  Like, I somehow, like, got toothpaste on the counter, and I was like, oh, and I grabbed  the Bic razor.  Right.  The little plastic blue double-edged razor.  I was like, let me clean this toothpaste off the counter.  I tried, like, and it didn't work.  Then I licked the razor.  I'm like, man, I'm really screwed now.  Like, so I licked this razor, and I thought, like, all this blood's going everywhere out  of my tongue.  I honestly thought, I am... 
[01:36:00]  I'm over.  And literally within ten minutes, my tongue stopped bleeding, and my parents never found  out.  Wow.  Like, to this day, my parents still don't know that I licked toothpaste out of their Bic razor.  Oh, rocks.  Without having done that, I would not have known that I can do this light bulb trick.  Steve-O, you're freaking out, people.  Joe, what's up?  Wow.  You're next on the Opie and Anthony show.  Oh, this guy's making me sick.  Yeah.  I'm not here to make you happy, buddy.  Trying to drive home.  We got the video.  We'll put it up on foundrymusic.com later on today.  I'll look at it when I get back. 
[01:36:30]  All right, cool.  You guys suck.  People are losing their minds.  Is that something you tell these guys to say you suck, or...  Yeah, it's, you know...  Do you just have a unique brand of idiot?  Kind of like Primus.  Primus, you know, Primus sucks.  All right, right on.  Hey, Jason, what's up?  Primus has a bad attitude about sucking sometimes.  I've been to one of their concerts.  Really?  Yeah.  I mean, I don't know.  I'm not going to criticize them, but they didn't like getting stuff thrown at them.  Well, saying you suck and throwing stuff at you.  Hey, Jason.  Yeah, but then again...  Yeah, what's up?  ...changing their story when stuff hits the stage.  That's cool. 
[01:37:00]  Jason, what do you got for Steve-O?  This dude is effing making me sick.  Yeah.  Oh, come on, Steve.  You're trying to make these guys think better.  Oh, man.  Where does sick come into this, dude?  The fool in the right mind cuts their tongue with a broken shard of light bulb.  I know.  It says on the screen you don't believe that his tongue is bleeding.  The blood was pouring out of his mouth.  And that wasn't...  I mean, granted, if I was some sort of scientist, I wouldn't want to get near my tongue right  now, but you being on the other end of a frickin' phone line, let's not cry like a little baby 
[01:37:30]  over here, okay?  Aaron from Boston saying Steve-O and Dee, the new city, Nancy.  And we're having safe communication that I don't think you should really be too worried  about.  And Ken from New York is saying he's Wolverine Jackass with mutant healing powers.  Like the X-Men.  See, I got all these cool dudes, like, getting me wasted in their radio studio while I'm literally 
[01:38:00]  spitting blood all over their desk.  Nothing wrong with that.  And some fruitcake's crying on the other end of a phone line about...  He can't believe he's hearing what he's hearing.  I mean, I'm not calling him a fruitcake.  That's good.  I'm not calling him a fruitcake.  I'm just asking him to party a little more.  What's wrong with Dee?  What's wrong with being extreme?  I apologize, dude.  I really do apologize.  You're not a fruitcake, but let's focus more on what's going right.  Right.  And let's not look at what's going wrong.  Hey, kids are fun.  Can Dee do some tricks for us?  Yeah, be extreme.  That makes some girls horny.  Dee, you want to do some tricks?  Yeah? 
[01:38:30]  You like that?  Um, I don't have a lot of tricks.  I think Dee might have the ability to catch, um...  But everybody does...  Different objects.  Like, maybe not all office objects.  She's got a darn good chance of catching office objects between her boobs.  Really?  I've never done anything freaky before.  Depending on the object, that is.  Like, wing a bowling ball at her or something.  We need to clear the object with her.  We need to get permission from her.  Say, hey, like, this highlighter pen's looking pretty good. 
[01:39:00]  Hey, man.  Hey, what stories can you tell?  Well, like, um...  I mean, everybody knows things that are strange.  What?  Now, before my tongue stops bleeding...  Before my tongue stops bleeding...  By the way, you guys aren't going anywhere.  This is radio gold today.  Okay, so you have a kitten.  She's telling the story, yeah.  And you have some milk.  And a kitten's tongue has all these little, like...  Sandpaper, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And so you put the milk on you, and you let the kitten look it off.  And that feels really, really good.  Oh, yeah?  It's freaky, but...  You wanted to get us...  Have you done that? 
[01:39:30]  We'll get you a kitten right now.  In lieu of a cat, we have Jim Norris.  Are you guys not feeling the booby toss?  No, we might actually do that.  I just wanted to hear the story.  That was pretty cool.  It was not good.  Oh, we're feeling it.  Believe me.  Steve-O, you got one more...  Because it's not just her sitting there as some kind of target.  Yeah.  It's skill.  She needs to literally clamp...  Right.  Can we tell you something we did?  That was pretty cool.  We got a stripper to come down here completely naked, and we were throwing cherry darts at ground 
[01:40:00]  zero.  At her balloon knot.  It was nice.  Yeah, it was great.  And the guy that hit...  Cooter ball.  The guy that hit the bullseye won in Xbox.  It's like the legendary game.  Cooter ball.  Cooter ball.  Yeah.  You get the ball in the cooter.  All right.  I mean, it's...  It's...  It's...  I mean, I'm not even going to claim to, like, invent it.  It's just...  It's international.  Let me go to Dustman real fast.  It's just known.  He's checking in from Sacramento.  Dustman, what's up?  What's up, boys?  Hey.  Hey, you guys got Victoria Jackson in there?  I keep hearing her in the background.  That's who I was trying to think of.  Yeah, your voice sounds a little like Victoria Jackson. 
[01:40:30]  Do you have any weed, man?  Hey, man.  Cool, man.  Never mind.  We are officially representing...  Oh, in the Naughty Nighty contest?  Yes.  We have Natalie here.  You guys want to talk to her?  Sacramento.  Absolutely.  Sacramento on the board for the Naughty Nighty contest.  Hang on.  Here she is.  All right.  First girl representing Sacramento.  Hey, fellas.  How's it going?  Hey, what's up?  What do you look like?  What do I look like?  Oh, my goodness.  Well, I don't look at how I sound right now. 
[01:41:00]  I apologize.  I'm straining right now.  Extracurricular activities, if you know what I mean.  But, yeah.  So, maybe I'll have one of the guys tell you what I look like.  I'm about five, six and a half.  Uh-huh.  I'm sold.  Let's do it.  That's it.  The hype got me on.  Yeah, it's like, you might say I'm joking, but I have literally wrangled chicks off the Internet  that I am not going to show you pictures of.  You know what?  I've actually been on the website and...  You've got something coming with Jim Norton now. 
[01:41:30]  You know, I...  Hey, guys.  Yes, yes, we're here.  Are you here with me?  Don't worry about it.  Sort of.  We're all over the place.  We'd like to be more with you.  Yeah.  A little party going on in here today.  Okay.  This is what it's all about.  You guys, I have, like, no competition.  And I'm representing the West Coast, Sacramento, till the end, baby.  And, you know what?  All those girls just need to look out, because not only just myself, who's going to represent,  but I have, like, probably a dozen other girls that can come in here and represent Sacramento.  All right.  Well...  What are you saying? 
[01:42:00]  That are penthouse, playboy material.  So you're saying the girls you've seen on opianthony.com are nothing compared to what you've got?  Well, I must...  You know, I'm going to give credit.  I'm going to give credit where credit's due.  There are two little hotties in there.  And I find beauty in everybody.  Don't get it twisted.  But I will say...  Oh, thank God for you.  It just dawned on me that we really have listeners.  It's all over the country.  Oh, my God.  Bring it on.  I'm all wondering how she's in California.  All right.  Put Dustman back on.  All right, honey.  It was good talking to you guys.  We look forward to seeing her question. 
[01:42:30]  Good thing that we're upsetting the entire nation.  Okay.  Take care.  All right.  Bye-bye.  Behaving badly for an even worse cause.  Hey.  She's cocky there, Duckman.  Hey, man.  Sacramento.  Is she that hot?  Yeah, she's very hot.  Dude, be honest.  Is she so effing hot, it's like spewing your pants hot?  Well, hang on a second.  Do dogs that bark not mislead?  She's wowing me.  Oh, yeah.  She's way hot, dude.  Is she hotter than all the girls on opianathlete.com?  Dude, do hot chicks call radio stations to claim how hot they are? 
[01:43:00]  I mean, let's be real.  Dude, dogs that bark bite.  We'll show you pictures, though.  True.  All right, Dustman.  Get those pictures, man.  All right, man.  We'll be sending them off here shortly.  There you go.  All right, guys.  First girl from Sacramento, man.  Hey, Steve, are there any, like, lasting things with that glass?  That's got to come out.  You know, I am waiting for my intestines to say ouch.  I mean, I don't think glass can be digested.  You know what I mean?  At all. 
[01:43:30]  I think that it's just, like, enough of a just horrible lifestyle, like, really just trying  to help you live it.  Right, so it's kind of used to it.  As long as it's just a steady flow of really putrid sludge that just sort of slides through.  Okay, I got you.  We need to take a break.  Joe, real fast.  Okay.  Yeah.  Hey, Joe.  Hey, how's it going?  Good.  You guys got to play that back when he cuts his tongue with the blade.  And I think he actually had things slicing into his tongue. 
[01:44:00]  Yeah, you could hear it.  You could kind of hear it on the mic.  Did you hear it on the thing?  I heard it on the radio in my car.  All right, we'll find the audio and replay it.  Hey, dude.  Tongue's heel fast, man.  Yeah, check it out.  Thank you, man.  But don't do it, dude.  Dude, that was one of the sickest things I've ever seen.  Cheers to Steve-O.  Cheers to Steve-O.  Yeah, the video will be up on FoundryMusic.com if you don't believe it.  These guys didn't even watch the horrible crap they're promoting.  It's so much worse.  Hey, you know something?  I will watch this.  It's so much worse than what they say.  You got one more stunt in you, you think?  One more?  Let's figure it out. 
[01:44:30]  We'll figure it out.  One more with Steve-O.  Also, real fast, Naughty Nighty Contest.  Four more girls from Cleveland have entered the contest.  Their pictures are up on opiananthony.com.  They're up to eight girls in the Cleveland area.  You want to be in the Naughty Nighty Contest?  Yeah, yeah.  Can we take a picture of your girlfriend for the whole country?  That's a question for my girlfriend.  Do you have something we could call a Naughty Nighty?  No.  I think that she's got something naughtier than anything else you're going to do.  Why don't you just wear the skirt?  I don't think you need to be gauging the naughtiness.  We could get, like, plastic or something. 
[01:45:00]  Can you just wear the skirt that you're wearing around your top?  Plastic bags or something.  Let's try to get on the girls or we're going to have a problem with this.  Right.  All right.  Really fast, Steve-O's here from Jackass.  His video's called Don't Try This at Home, the Steve-O video.  Go to Steve-O-Video.com.  Somebody wants us to spell Steve-O.  Thank you, Ben.  Oh, wow.  Steve-O-Video.com.  Figure it out.  It's also entitled, I mean, the real title is Don't Try This at Home.  Right.  It's also called Please Don't Sue Us.  And you can call 1-800-263-8122 to buy the video. 
[01:45:30]  All that info will be up on our website later on.  We went to such extraordinary lengths to not make it any huge corporation's problem.  It's just sort of our own little independent.  There's something, yeah.  There's no logos on there that you're going to recognize.  It's just a lot of horrible things.  Yeah, that's true.  And America loves watching another man in pain.  I've seen people take more responsibility for a snuff film.  I just, like, you know, I'm trying to package more pain into one DVD. 
[01:46:00]  How's this?  We'll take a break and Steve-O will do one more thing.  Very cool.  And maybe Dee, his girlfriend, will do a little stunt, right?  Okay.  Right on.  The Opie and Anthony F.U. line is there for you when life sucks.  Sucks to be me.  Call anytime.  2-1-2-8-3-0-3-7-8-5.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  And E-W.  What a day, what a day, what a day.  Just do it with the panties. 
[01:46:30]  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  That looks good.  Take the jeans off.  Quick, while Steve-O's not in here.  Here's the deal.  Get his chip naked.  Steve-O just took a walk down the hall, and his girlfriend's in here.  She wants to join the Naughty Nighty contest.  Hey, Dee.  Dee, stand over there and take your pants off.  Steve-O's going to be back soon.  We've got to work quick.  She just took off her jeans.  All right, go over there.  Let's see the panties.  Wait, before you put that on.  Go over there.  Wait, let me see. 
[01:47:00]  Turn around, Dee.  I want to see your panties.  All right, Steve-O's girlfriend is pretty much naked in the studio.  Steve-O's down the hall.  Steve-O's smoking.  Sound the hall.  Wow.  Very nice.  She's got a wow shirt on.  She's got an O.P. and Anthony wow shirt on.  Quick, have sex with him before he gets back.  She's digging the fat boys.  She's digging the tunes.  Hey, what is she wearing?  Now you're wearing a little skirt.  That's cool.  You don't have anything else, though, besides a wow shirt to wear for the Naughty Nighty contest? 
[01:47:30]  Hey, talk under the mic.  Get her on mic.  You don't have?  I didn't know I was coming.  You've got to make something different, though.  Can't you just, you know what?  Take it, get a scissor, right?  Cut this T-shirt so it's only a small strip where the wow is.  Top and bottom.  No sleeves.  No nothing.  Yeah, you need to show.  Huh?  No, that'll work.  Like a little tank top thing.  Yeah, that'll kind of work.  No, doesn't show enough, man.  I'm not digging it.  We need shoulders. 
[01:48:00]  Yeah, we got to maybe get you some plastic bags or something.  Something see through.  Yeah.  Right?  Oh, jeez.  She's so hefty, man.  I'm just waiting for us to have to do the scene out of Pulp Fiction with the needle in  the heart.  It's just a matter of time.  Oh, my God.  Now she's chugging tequila.  There you go.  Oh, okay.  She rolled her skirt down a little bit.  That's better.  Chase it with beer, too.  Chase it with a little beer.  Oh, that'll go well with the Xanax.  She's been popping all day.  How many Xanax did you take?  Eight.  Eight.  Eight Xanax? 
[01:48:30]  Since when?  About two hours ago.  All right.  Here's the deal, Anthony.  How can I be pleased with this?  What?  Who?  Henry.  Henry Rollins.  Right.  We don't want Henry Rollins after us.  Do you hang with Henry Rollins?  Yeah.  You're his chick, right?  No.  Yeah.  You are.  He's a cool guy.  We've had him on this show.  All right.  She wants to just pose.  She's bending over and shaking her ass in the corner.  Bring on the girls. 
[01:49:00]  That's pretty.  You are the girl.  You are both the other girls.  I got you.  Do you want another girl there?  Bring on another girl so we can have a contest.  I have my shirt on, my fur for me.  It's scary.  Yeah.  So you can have a what?  I'm trying hard.  You're doing great.  You're doing a great job.  Anthony, some info for the listeners.  Steve-O, yeah, he cut his tongue with the light bulb on purpose.  The pictures are up on WNEW.com and I believe OpieAndAnthony.com right now. 
[01:49:30]  Uh-huh.  Hey, Steve, you want to grab that camera and just like point it at her?  Of course.  For the people at home.  There you go.  There you go.  Hey, D, Henry Rollins knows that we have nothing to do with this, right?  Yeah.  Because we've got him in studio.  Henry's like a big guy.  He's an intimidating mother effer.  Huh?  Let's just stop talking about it?  Okay.  I bet he really appreciates your beauty.  Yeah, go to the stinky cam.  Some great shots right now on the stinky cam. 
[01:50:00]  There she goes.  She's dancing around.  Keep Steve-O in the stairwell for a while.  Does anybody have a pinball machine we can drink?  Someone go get the wiffle ball bat.  Who would convict anybody?  Go get the wiffle ball bat.  No!  Oh, man.  That's very good.  How did you hook up with Steve-O?  I like to make a scene of myself. 
[01:50:30]  You do?  Yeah.  You do a good job.  I mean, you hooked up with Henry Rollins.  How did you hook up with Steve-O?  I was making a scene of myself.  You were?  Where?  When did you meet Steve-O?  In Columbus.  In Columbus?  How long ago was that?  I get drunk and I get a little loud.  You do?  And what?  You were hanging out and you said,  Hey, Steve-O.  You know.  Yeah?  Woo!  Like this.  She screams and pulls out her can. 
[01:51:00]  You are a party girl, man.  What do you do for a living, if I may ask?  I'm a free spirit.  A free spirit.  Did you go to college for that?  I had an ATG scholarship to college, but I didn't go.  What do you do, though, for money and stuff?  I'm a free spirit.  Do you dance at all?  No.  No?  No.  You just kind of hang out and...  I just like to travel.  Henry Rollins, like, kind of foots the bill and stuff?  No.  You're a kept girl, are you? 
[01:51:30]  No.  No?  No.  All right, Steve-O's coming back.  Put your clothes back on.  All right, a free spirit.  I don't know.  Here, put your clothes back on.  Come, Steve-O.  Steve, free spirit.  I hear you.  Hey, Steve-O.  Steve.  Hey, welcome back, man.  And I turned my shirt into a spirit.  That is it.  That is it.  Steve-O, man.  Have you figured out what flying projectiles have the best chance?  Bring on the girl.  Bring on the girl.  Baby. 
[01:52:00]  Steve, she's really hot.  I know she's hot.  I know she's hot.  When you were in the stairwell, she was changing into that little get-up.  As applies to every aspect of life.  Yeah.  It doesn't matter what you want.  It simply matters how drastically bad you want.  You know?  The meaning of life is not to wonder what the meaning of life is.  It's to pretty much get off your ass and pick a meaning for your life.  Was this learned in the stairwell? 
[01:52:30]  And believe in it.  And believe in it.  Steve, how was the stairwell?  Oh, good God.  Did you sign the wall by Vanilla Ice?  I wrote something that might not go over too well.  That's fine, man.  We call that Club Stinky.  You like Club Stinky?  It's Club Stinky.  It's where we like people go and hang out.  Vanilla Ice was there.  You signed the wall.  You just made Stinky's life.  I don't really cruise around making places smell better.  Hey, should we invite all the girls in to see if maybe there's a little connection with you? 
[01:53:00]  All right, D. Bring on me up.  Now, back to D.  Yeah.  About her talent.  Yes.  Yes, she is talented.  Yes.  She's absolutely beautiful.  Steve, what does she do?  We're trying to figure out what she does.  Now, what would be the point?  She said she's a free spirit, but what does she do for a living?  Oh, let's just say that we like her the way she is.  Not for what she says.  Okay.  Not for the information that she's going to convey. 
[01:53:30]  Well, we're all right.  Why is Stinky bringing in the wiffle ball bat?  Oh, my God.  Stinky, why did you bring in the wiffle ball bat?  I'm going to go ahead.  Stinky, why don't you explain to Steve-O why you brought the wiffle ball bat in?  Did he get spanked with it?  Ha, ha.  Wow.  You guys are on a fast track to have her start laughing at her asses for being pussies.  I mean, to be honest, she's going to be like, ha, ha, wiffle ball bat?  Ha, ha.  She's going to literally, like, wonder what kind of kindergarten games you guys are playing with the wiffle ball bat. 
[01:54:00]  Oh, no, no, no, no.  Let me tell you about the wiffle ball bat.  We do our own stunts around here, my friend.  If you look up top, you'll see the wiffle ball bat.  There are notches on it with corresponding names next to the notches.  All right, well, I'm going to say there's arrest reports for dudes who got caught holding her last video.  Uh-oh.  Really?  I mean, like, I'm not actually going to back that up in any, like, I'm drunk, okay?  I hear you. 
[01:54:30]  But, like, she's going to be more likely to get people arrested than to say no.  Oh, is that it?  I'm not, no, being, like, the operative word.  She's not going to disapprove of any such suggestion.  Is she a bitch?  I'm 22.  Oh, okay.  All right.  She answers to about five different names.  Really?  Depending on what phone number she gets calls from.  Oh, I see.  Okay, if you don't stop now, there would be violence. 
[01:55:00]  Okay, baby.  Cool.  All I wanted to ask my babe is, uh, what's the point in having such great boobs if you  don't know how to catch flying objects between them?  All right, well, let's try it.  Can we get some stuff to throw?  All right.  Yeah, well, we need some stuff to throw.  Let's grab some things around here.  All we need is a small contest and catching flying objects between beautiful fake boobs.  Could she catch my mule if I throw it?  Get a mule.  I mean.  I have a goat. 
[01:55:30]  Well, if I had boobs, I would literally be ready to play.  No, you really do have a goat.  Do you?  Well, he really has a mule.  Hold on.  I'll try my beer.  I'll be right back.  Oh, okay.  I see.  I was getting his beer.  See, the wiffle ball.  Okay.  Baby, I didn't mean to be mean.  No, he's not mean.  Look.  Oh, yeah.  I'm sorry.  Mary, she wants to kiss you.  Mary.  Mary.  Everybody wants to kiss you.  I thought I was a limerade.  Do you guys, when you come here, do you ever miss this?  All right, Steve-O is leaving this. 
[01:56:00]  I don't know what he's doing.  Steve, you've got to grab your beer, man.  Oh, you want to throw stuff at our boobs?  Oh, here it comes.  And we're in a contest with these.  No, no.  Oh, my God.  Hold on.  Hold on.  We have to dump out of that, unfortunately.  All right.  I'm not going to.  That's cool.  Just don't curse.  Yeah, stand over there, and he's going to throw a lime at you, and you've got to catch  it.  I'm going to share your catches.  Can I do?  Yeah, catch it in your boobs.  I mean, obviously, it's not going to be easy. 
[01:56:30]  Yeah, it's going to be hard.  You're both going to have to work together.  Yeah, come closer.  Come closer.  Come a little closer.  There we go.  Yeah, we say, who's contestant number two?  I'm ready.  Whatever.  Give me something.  I'll throw something.  Contestant number two?  I'll throw.  Get over here.  Get ready.  All right.  You're on deck, bud.  All right.  Hold on.  All right.  She's standing there.  Got the boobs.  Ready to go.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  Got the boobs.  She's got the boobs.  Ready to go. 
[01:57:00]  It's not got the boobs.  It's called.  I went in now.  All right.  All right.  Where's Opie?  Right here.  Awesome.  Here we go.  All right.  Pitch.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  He hit a square.  He hit her in the heart.  Hit a square in the face.  Baby, I'm sorry.  I did.  I nailed it.  Oh, yeah.  She's falling over.  I hit her square in the frigging eyes.  No, no, no, no, no.  What happened, dude?  What I just threw was actually half of the line. 
[01:57:30]  I know.  I hit her in the face so hard.  It was just juice.  It was getting flying out into her eyes.  I'm so sorry.  All right.  Oh, you got it.  This is hard because you can't do it.  Oh.  We're there.  Hey, no help in the end.  All right.  Here we go.  Let's do this.  Let's do it full on.  All right.  All right.  Anthony is going to toss.  Here we go.  I'm ready.  Softball.  Softball.  Come on.  Oh.  There you go.  A little high.  Made it work.  Woo.  There she goes. 
[01:58:00]  Steve, grab your beer, man.  Where's your beer?  Where I was snorting all the drugs.  Right.  Was that in the back?  Where the hell's the beer?  All right.  What about the wiffle ball bat?  Let's go back to the wiffle ball bat.  Ah, tequila.  All right, man.  Steve's going to go grab his beer.  Yeah.  Hell yeah, Steve.  All right.  We'll take some phone calls.  Hell yeah.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Guys, you've got my secret down. 
[01:58:30]  Xanax is how I won this summer.  Oh, with the...  The t-shirt contest.  Yeah.  You think I was doing that?  Put five Xanax in me and some tequila and same thing happened.  God bless the company that makes Xanax.  But yeah, and I think I found a couple for Mark and I to double with.  Oh, Jesus.  I would mess with that man.  Henry Rollins, hello.  I'm not kidding.  I'm kidding.  Damn it.  But anyway, she is an absolute riot and she is making me laugh so hard. 
[01:59:00]  And I wish I was there so I could meet her.  Well, people are...  I was going to try to slip in the wiffle ball bat while Steve was getting his beer.  I know.  People are starting to take bets when this girl is going to fall over.  Fall over.  Oh, dear.  I'm actually looking at her calculating prison time.  I don't know whether it's worth it or not.  You think she'd show a hiney?  All right, not Liz.  Thank you.  All right.  You guys are the best.  Bye.  All right.  Say hi to Psycho.  She is very hot.  Oh.  Why don't we...  She's so out of it. 
[01:59:30]  Why don't we take this time to...  I don't know.  I'll take a little break.  All right.  We got more contestants up on the opianthony.com website as far as the Naughty Nighty thing  goes.  Cleveland coming on strong.  Yeah.  We'll have some representation from Sacramento up there soon.  By the way, Rick...  I'm hearing Boston involved in the Naughty Nighty contest finally.  All right.  Rick, those pictures will be up soon on opianthony.com.  Yes, sir.  The guy taking the pictures from Cleveland, he is trying to capture the Rick style.  Have you noticed this?  Look at the first couple of pictures from Cleveland. 
[02:00:00]  And now look at the pictures after he's gotten to look at Rick's work.  The pictures are getting sluttier.  You'll notice now he's posing the girls.  The picture taken is getting sluttier.  The lighting's a little different.  The distance from the contestant a little different.  Rick, the guy is ripping off your style hoo-hoo.  You know what, though?  Totally.  You know what, though?  Cleveland does not want to lose this contest.  Uh-uh.  They are very competitive.  Coming right to the table.  What is that?  There's some...  Oh, no.  You don't want to hear, what is that?  What's in that?  Sorry. 
[02:00:30]  Hey, Dee.  What happened, Dee?  Um, I had to take a break.  I had to freshen up.  Freshen up?  Hey, Dee, you want to take the Whiffle Ball That challenge?  What does that mean?  See, we take that Whiffle Ball That?  Lock the studio.  Lock the studio.  Okay, hold on.  No, here's how it works, Dee, real quick.  Try to concentrate.  You take the Whiffle Ball That.  We put a condom on it.  We lube it up.  And you've got to see how far you...  I'm mainly straight into a steer of you.  What did she say?  What did she say? 
[02:01:00]  She made her shirt into what?  Those fat girls are really getting jealous.  Oh, holy...  Those fat girls are what?  I'm just telling you the truth.  The fat girls out there, they're really getting jealous.  Oh, my...  I mean, at first...  Listen, listen, Anthony, listen.  We had a lot of plans for today's show, but it just went out the window.  Yeah, go ahead, Dee.  At first, they were being nice.  She's saying be quiet.  Okay.  At first, they were being nice to me, and they were waving. 
[02:01:30]  Then what happened?  And now they don't like me at all.  Why do you think?  Well, let's bring the fat girls in and find out, Ed.  Oh, they're getting jealous.  Hey, why don't we confront them and see what's going on.  We'll just bring them in.  Okay.  Holy Jesus Christ.  All right, the girls are coming in.  Hi, girls.  Get on the mics.  Get on that mic over there.  That mic will come in.  Okay, get on the mic.  Get on the mic.  All right, Dee, Dee, get over here. 
[02:02:00]  Dee, get on that mic.  Get on that mic, Dee.  The girls on that mic.  How did they just drag us in, too?  No, I did it.  I'm sorry.  I told them, I said, those girls have been out there waiting so long.  No, no, you didn't say that.  You didn't say those girls.  Hey, you didn't associate friends.  Guys, guys, guys, shh, shh.  Don't tell her, but we heard her.  I said, those girls have been out there waiting too long, and they should come in here and have their turn.  Did you call us nasty names?  No, I didn't.  No, I didn't.  No, you know what, though? 
[02:02:30]  I just called nasty names.  You know what?  Honestly, I'd say I was scrawny, and you were chubby.  So, hey.  Scrawny is a nasty name.  Oh, hey, babe, babe.  I'm sick.  I'm sick.  Basically, Dee.  Basically, Dee.  I said, it's their turn to come in.  Hold on.  Dee said that you girls were getting jealous of her.  No, no.  You think she's beautiful.  I told her I wanted to come in and kiss her.  Well, I just thought, you guys see that as her.  You've been waiting for them.  Oh, thank you.  Hey, Dee, would you kiss the fat girl, as you called her? 
[02:03:00]  Oh, wow.  Why don't we make it all good?  Go kiss the fat girl.  Here we go.  I didn't mean no offense, but I'm...  Oh.  Okay, now there's some...  We'll have to walk in.  Oh, you have a great body.  You all right, man?  All right, they're going to kiss, I think.  I just...  Hey, look.  They make the number 10, everyone.  I just apologize.  I just apologize to Dee in the bathroom.  Yeah.  Why?  Well, I said, hey, babe, it's not that I was telling them what you'd do with a wiffle ball bat. 
[02:03:30]  It's just I don't freaking know.  You want us to tell you?  I mean, like, I'm not saying what you might think of their wiffle ball bat stunt, but  for crying out loud...  You put the wiffle ball bat stunt on your tape, you'll sell a million DVDs.  A million.  To be honest, like...  What's going on?  No, I'm not.  No, I apologize to Dee for that in the bathroom.  Okay, cool.  It had nothing to do with illegal street narcotics or my overwhelmingly unsuccessful quest for 
[02:04:00]  the door that my bureau is behind.  Oh, you couldn't find it?  You did?  You did?  Yeah.  Hey, remember, don't try this at home, the Steve-O video.  Steve-O-Video.com.  It's all the stuff that MTV wouldn't show.  Don't try it at home.  Right.  Don't show it to your mom.  I got one.  Don't even let your little brother go near it.  All right.  Hey, Steve-O, can we take a break and you do one other thing here or what?  Yeah.  I think that Dee owes that to me after his behavior. 
[02:04:30]  Yeah, Dee, you're going to do something with Steve-O, I think.  I thought that was my babe right there.  I'm not here to judge her character.  We're being cool for her.  I'm not going to get mad at her if she strays from, you know.  I'm a good girl.  I'm with her, man.  I'm here to make people happy.  That's great.  She's been out of line while I was out of the room.  She's simply going to have to perform a stunt.  I'm thinking everyone happy.  All right.  And it's something that we're going to celebrate probably until tomorrow. 
[02:05:00]  All right.  We're going to do something with Steve-O and his girlfriend Dee, I think.  And tonight, as all these listeners, literally nationally, I can't believe that my pitiful,  narcotics-infested, drunken ass is talking to the entire nation.  And if you guys aren't feeling me all over the country, then do feel this.  We are faced with our last opportunity to truly party intensely before tomorrow. 
[02:05:30]  And we cannot let that slip away.  Hey, can we stay below?  So please, people, can we stay below?  Let's get Dee ready for rock and roll.  I'm thinking about some much larger objects.  I think this is going from a game of catch distinctly into a game of dodgeball. 
[02:06:00]  All right.  And it is on.  And I've got some words to talk to my girl about.  All right, look, when we get back, Steve-O's going to do something.  We don't even know yet, but he'll do something else.  All right.  Before we take a break, it's Frenchie and Marion going at it.  Yeah, this is great.  We played this at the top of the show.  Yeah, check this out.  Check this out.  Frenchie!  Yes!  How you doing?  Hey, how you guys been? 
[02:06:30]  Two annoying bitches.  Hey, goose crap.  Retarded whore bag.  You Canadian, where?  You annoying fat whore bag.  Are you from Canada?  I'm not from Canada, you twat.  Where's your home?  Do you have a home?  You down-sealing twat whore, fat bitch.  You Canadian gang.  Shut up, you twat.  Why don't you go fall into a big vat of, uh, careless things? 
[02:07:00]  When I saw you the first time, I looked at you and said, she has to be the dumbest  whore in the world.  Go find a park you could crap in.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, shut the head up, you whore.  You sound like a retard.  Why do I shut up?  The only thing you know is succeed, you whore bag.  You sound like you're queer.  You must have a chromosome left over in the toilet every time you go to the bathroom.  Why don't you cross the river so the alligator can get you?  Shut up, what?  Go find a park you could crap in.  Yeah, yeah, shut the head up.  You look like a down-sealing bitch and you're married. 
[02:07:30]  I don't know what kind of husband you have.  That's it, that's it, that's it, that's it.  Why don't you goddamn die already?  Why don't you die first?  I'll die after.  Die, die, get in the coffin and die.  The Opie and Anthony show.  I just want to be with a man who'll ignore me and take me for granted and who's only pretending  to be interested in who I am and what I think, so I can get into my scale.  Dirty girls move, love, too.  Opie and I.  You know where a guy can get a rub and a tug around you?  Anthony. 
[02:08:00]  N-D-W.  What's he doing?  Founcing a beer on his forehead.  He said he'd drink the whole thing without using a hand.  He's down like, uh...  He started standing.  He's now sitting on the floor, slowly, easing himself back on his shoulders.  All right, now he's completely laying down.  He's getting his feet up.  He's grabbing the bottle with his knees. 
[02:08:30]  Lift around.  Wow, that's a tough move.  Now it's on the floor.  Now he's putting it in his mouth and getting choked in the beer.  God damn.  That's all right, man.  No, man.  And that will get you more beer in the bar.  That's all right.  It wasn't on mic anyway.  Grab that mic.  Grab that end mic right there, Steve.  Hey, Steve-O from Jackass in the studio.  It's Steve-O-Video.com, you tools.  Everyone's like going, I'm going to Steve-O.  It's not them being tools. 
[02:09:00]  It's Steve-O-Video.com to order the DVD, Don't Try This At Home, the Steve-O-Video, all the  stuff that MTV would not show.  What did he say?  He goes, I think it's the overwhelming demand for this absolute garbage.  I mean, that's really what it is.  That's really what it is.  You cannot clog up a highway in this country better than to just show a horrible, disgusting  accident on it.  Right.  True.  People stop, man.  They love it.  And it's much the same.  You can't clog up a website much better than to put this trash that I, but people just have 
[02:09:30]  to stop and take note of how.  You just described our show.  Right.  Exactly.  It's what it is on a daily basis.  So, I think that you guys are a little bold to take credit for actually being as far out  of bounds as I'm here to not be proud of.  No, we're just as far out of bounds as we can get to keep our job.  You've actually lost your job.  What tangible form, what do you have tangible to show what doesn't get edited? 
[02:10:00]  Oh, our video.  We got our video.  Do you have, like, streaming footage of...  We got hours and hours of video that we couldn't even describe what was going on on the air.  A daisy chain of teen lesbian girls just sucking and...  How much does it cost for that?  I don't know.  Actually, Steve, run them off a copy, man.  This is Steve C.  Steve C is our...  This is our guy, Steve C. 
[02:10:30]  He's the video guy.  We have seen such...  You can see our stuff.  He'll give you stuff that way.  Do you understand that, like, I don't know what the actual word, but the secret behind  the girls got on wild videos is that there is ass, uh, little clam, clammy, booming.  There's some clam.  We got it.  We got it.  Like, full-on, like, anal annihilation.  I mean, Jess, ruining, ruining girls. 
[02:11:00]  What, Dee?  Huh?  I need a favor.  What's up, Dee?  What's your favor, Dee?  Mary.  Yeah, she needs to make out, Mary.  Go over there.  I just want to kiss.  Just one.  Oh, my God.  She's so sweet and innocent.  She goes to college.  It's just a kiss.  Mary, give her a quick kiss.  Just a kiss, Mary.  Why not?  Here it goes, Mary.  There you go.  Look at her.  Dee's been flirting with Mary ever since she got here.  No tongue or anything, Mary's yelling.  How about her?  Oh, my God.  It's like you kiss your mother.  All right, wait. 
[02:11:30]  All right, hey.  Now, she's pulling on Mary.  Oh, so kiss her, Mary.  It's a virgin.  It's a virgin six.  Oh, she tried to slip the tongue, and Mary said, no, no, no.  Now, it's a virgin six, right?  You guys are on until seven.  Yeah.  You guys are on until seven.  Oh, yeah.  I'm guessing.  Yes, dude?  I'm guessing that I'm probably getting old at this point.  I am so.  I can hardly breathe through my nose.  I have been snorting so much narcotics.  And my relationship with my girl is not running so smooth right now. 
[02:12:00]  No?  What's the matter?  Hey, that's the hat.  All my shortcomings, I'm obviously not really winning right now.  We could go to the phone and see if they want you to leave or not.  Let's go to the phone.  I think they're going to.  Before, I want to answer calls before I get assaulted with an industrial staple gun.  Oh, that's right.  We're doing the staple thing?  Oh, yeah.  We are going to apply many office items to my 70s push with a staple gun. 
[02:12:30]  We did.  We explained the wiffle ball back to you, right?  Let's do some creative.  How about we staple dollar bills?  Yeah, dude.  Come on, now.  Is that something better?  Come on, now.  Tell me.  I mean, at least, like, get that whole coffee cup going right there.  Yeah?  All right.  I mean, I don't know, dude.  Staple that.  Wow.  Let's just make it crucial.  Yeah?  Make it crucial.  Sounds like puck.  I mean, trust me, dude.  Like, the actual staple itself never hurts any less.  But let's just make it look good, dude. 
[02:13:00]  I got you.  I hear you.  By stapling really odd items.  Let's justify why I'm still here.  Some really odd items.  Well, let's go to the phones.  Stephanie and Sarah want to say hi.  Stephanie and Sarah, what's up?  What's up, Steve-o?  Hi, Steve-o.  Andy's here, too.  What up, Steve-o?  Yeah.  What's up, Steve?  Hey, Dee.  You remember how she stayed with us in Cleveland and you couldn't leave?  Hell yeah. 
[02:13:30]  Hey, what happened in Cleveland?  These girls know what they're talking about.  Oh, really?  What happened in Cleveland?  Hold on, guys.  Well, Dee stayed with us.  But I'm a little confused.  I thought that he was Preston's girlfriend, not Steve-o's.  No, Dee is Steve-o's girlfriend.  These girls know what they're talking about.  Yeah, we do.  They hook you up, Steve-o.  Well, when they say that I couldn't come to Cleveland, and I was, this guy right here,  my gangster manager.  Yeah.  First time I met him, he flies me to Cleveland. 
[02:14:00]  He says, hey, I'm going to fly you into this party.  You're not even going to be in Cleveland for 24 hours.  I'm going to fly you right out.  I'm going to pay a whole bunch of cash, just show up at this party, and I got your airfare.  You know, like, just eat, take a check on it.  So I'm like, wow, you know, this sounds pretty good, man.  Like, what do you want me to do?  And he says, I want you to show up and get wasted, dude.  How did he even say that?  You know what I mean?  Like, he actually used profanity to describe the behavior he was looking for. 
[02:14:30]  Now, as he promised.  What is going on?  As he promised, I was only delegated to be there for 24 hours.  Uh-huh.  But I saw the Cleveland River, dude, with a layer of thin ice.  And I was going to be damned if I was flying out of Cleveland before I put on ice skates and a tutu and skated all over that river until I fell through the frickin' ice.  Fell through the ice.  Good God bless Nick Dunlap and these ladies that are calling up to just make everybody know what a success it was to go extreme ice skating. 
[02:15:00]  I'm seeing that.  You're in your two-two.  This doesn't even look like thin ice.  Extreme ice skating.  It's gray water with a few ice cubes floating in it.  Fell through that ice was not only cold, it actually cut me where I bled a lot.  Really?  The ice cut you?  Yeah, yeah.  And it was a bummer because I wanted to start jumping off loading docks through the ice.  Oh, that's blood on the ice?  There's a still shot of it on the back of your DVD. 
[02:15:30]  You're pointing out a picture of the river that is the only river that ever caught on fire for being so polluted.  All right, listen.  Listen, Dave has...  It was a dead fish you're actually pointing to.  Dave has something.  Dave, what's up?  Yeah, why don't you guys try throwing some darts at Steve-O?  Oh, man, dude.  We've thrown the darts.  Yeah, we've done that with some guy.  Oh, dude.  I thought you were, like, joking around.  You saw it on the website, dude.  And of course he knows that human dartboard is in my video. 
[02:16:00]  Yeah, we've done that.  I tried to film human dartboard.  Thank you.  If you didn't know, trust me, that's not a new idea, buddy.  All right.  Yeah.  And I literally, like, got kicked out of three different English pubs in London, England,  trying to film it there.  They just could not feel me.  I thought darts are, like, English, you know?  Like, English people.  Right.  Yeah, they're into the darts.  I was like, dude, I got it there in England.  Yeah.  It just never happened.  I couldn't even give it a limey bastard to hand me any darts at all.  No, that's okay.  And we literally wound up filming it in Johnny Knoxville's living room instead. 
[02:16:30]  All right.  Hey, Steve-O, why don't we do something really sick?  Oh, yeah, totally, dude.  All right.  What do you want to do, man?  Well, I don't know, man.  I was thinking about some aerial acrobatics off all this technology.  We got the staple gun.  We got the staple gun.  Why don't we take down some chairs and tables off your, you know, thing with all the things  and the knobs.  She's not going to pass out, is she?  She's all right? 
[02:17:00]  It's just, I mean, what's the actual value of that?  I mean, it cannot be over 10 grand.  What?  This?  The board?  No, the actual, like, thing with all, like, the knobs.  Yeah, the board?  Yeah.  It's pretty expensive.  I'm not going to hurt it if I simply stand on it and dive over.  It's going to catch me, and it's all right.  I'm going to take my shoes off, too.  I'll light, lightly, lightly, trust me, dude.  I graduated from Ringling Brothers, Barnum and Billy Clown College. 
[02:17:30]  Yeah.  And I knew.  Can I get a girl to sit on my lap?  Yeah, go get a girl to sit on Dee's lap.  Yeah, we can't stand on the board.  We can stand over there.  All right, all right, all right.  All right, all right.  See that ledge?  Yeah.  That's my foothold.  Yeah.  That's my foothold now.  And where are you going to go, though?  In D&G's?  I want to dive over the technology and be caught by my shady attorney and my gangster manager.  Where, though?  And if anybody wants to help them out, you know, that's all right. 
[02:18:00]  But let's say, like, obviously, like, we're not here to make the world smell better.  Why the fuck that was sitting on our lap?  Yeah, can we crowd in there for a diving, you know?  What are you talking about?  Blood test?  I just want to climb on a lot of technology and dive through the studio.  I got you.  Into my shady attorney.  Don't worry, dude.  I'm all right.  Don't worry.  Now, let the listeners be fully aware of how unhappy everybody is on this idea. 
[02:18:30]  No, it's cool, because I've gotten up here.  I like the stapler, though.  All right, now, we will make sure that as soon as I land this dive, we are going to staple,  like, an object of your choice.  All right.  Let's open it up to the viewers.  Steve, I swear, I have not seen teeth grinding like that since, like, 88, man.  Since, like, 88.  Then how about you haven't seen a dude flying over all your technology, dude?  All right, let's go.  Here he goes.  All right, where's he going?  I don't even give him a flying wazoo if anybody catches me. 
[02:19:00]  All right, Steve, where are you jumping?  But this way, I'm going to go take the party to the bathroom, figure out what we're going  to staple.  All right.  All right, here goes Steve-O.  Here goes Steve-O.  He's inventing tricks.  Here he goes.  Don't step on the buttons, though.  Yes.  All right, here we go.  He's up on the boards.  You are going to crack your skull.  He's going to jump to the other side.  God damn.  All right there, Steve.  Yeah, he's okay. 
[02:19:30]  Hey.  How's your head?  I think you hit it on something.  That's okay.  You hit the clock.  You hit your head on the clock.  Pete Johnson is going to kill you.  Very good.  Hey, doesn't she want to make out with that girl?  Hey, T, are you going to make out with...  Uh-oh.  Bravo.  Uh-oh.  Yeah, I told you guys I was going to do that.  Yeah, I know, and you did it.  And I know that I'm a butt-knot idiot. 
[02:20:00]  That's the least of us.  I just crashed into my shitty attorney.  Let it hang.  Hey, he needs to say hello.  Can you hear me when I get a microphone?  Let that hang.  Good God, if anybody found out, that may have sworn over.  All right, just let it hang there.  That's fine.  The wires will hold it.  All right, listen.  This and this.  Hey, we're going to staple stuff.  Let's stop on that.  There you go.  Yeah, let's staple stuff.  Oh, my God.  This is impossible.  Oh, my God. 
[02:20:30]  The girl babbling from the corner.  You should have seen a rock hanging out of his nose.  Yeah, Steve-O, man, clean that up.  You got, like, a rock hanging out your nose.  I got at least turned out.  All right, everyone.  Dude, you are living the frigging lifestyle, bro.  It's okay.  You're not, you, you walk the goddamn walk, man.  He's the real deal.  The guy walks the walk.  He's the real deal.  It's not like a guy who does this stuff that you see, see it on, don't try it, this is at home, Steve-O.  But it's not like he does that and then goes home and goes, yes, let me call my broker. 
[02:21:00]  No, the guy's living the life.  All right, let's staple stuff to Steve-O.  Someone describe the listeners.  Yeah.  Get on mic.  You can describe the listeners.  Oh, yeah, get that mic over there.  Yeah, get it right there.  That mic's on.  All right, guys.  All right.  Yeah.  I'm not here to, like, claim to be proud.  I'm not a great guy.  You know what I'm saying?  Like, to be honest, like, I'm not better or worse. 
[02:21:30]  It's probably worse.  Yeah.  But, you know, like, distinctly, all I strive for is to be different.  Steve-O, let me explain something.  I just want to be different.  I understand, you know, there are a lot of different types of people in this world.  Well, if you're sick, you call a doctor.  If you want to party, you call someone like Steve-O.  Nah, nah, nah, nah.  There are purposes that everyone has in this world.  Yeah, dude.  I don't know.  That's the first real one.  Don't worry about it.  Don't worry about it.  Go ahead.  Yeah.  Oh, man, you guys are way cooler than all these other radio sissies. 
[02:22:00]  I'll tell you.  Make that into a promo.  I'll tell you.  You guys haven't even called the cops yet.  We went to the Samuel Adams Brewery.  Yeah, we've been up there.  It's pretty cool.  Under the tent, 35 radio stations.  Yeah, we went to that last year.  I had a call at the Samuel Adams that I had to do a radio interview with every last one  of 35 different radio stations in the course of two days. 
[02:22:30]  Jim Cook taking you around.  Let's just go ahead and say it didn't work out so good.  I wasn't hospitalized, and the other DJs, the one DJ called the cops.  Really?  Yeah, but then he didn't press charges.  Hey, we don't appreciate your brand of humor there, Steve-O.  He wouldn't press charges.  No?  Yeah.  He probably didn't have a real crime there that he could have.  God, and that's what I love about the radio is it's such a haven. 
[02:23:00]  I mean, the only way radio is ever worth its amount of money is if you just abuse the  hell out of it.  I got to agree with you on that one.  I mean, there's so little that you can actually get away with it.  Like, really, at the end of the day, you can tell people about other stuff, but, like,  in and of itself, radio needs to be very bad.  Uh-oh.  Who did you found a friend?  My friend.  Who's that?  That's Teen Rihanna.  Yeah, you can see her up on the, uh, website for the Naughty Naughty Con. 
[02:23:30]  You like her, Dee?  She showed up just in time to make this radio worse.  And she's got a look in her eye.  You like, uh, you like her, Dee?  Uh-huh.  Yeah?  What do you think, Rhiannon?  Oh, that, oh, she's gorgeous.  She's beautiful.  Yeah?  Will you give her the kiss she needs so much?  Oh, that's the real kiss right there.  Wow.  Yeah, but.  Hey, that's not bad.  Wow, that is pretty good.  Yeah.  Two girls kissing, okay? 
[02:24:00]  Let's say they've got boyfriends.  Yeah.  Now, like, two girls are kissing.  Right.  What might their boyfriend say?  Uh, they think it's kind of, like, hot to look at, I guess, or something.  Well, I mean, um, yeah, how about this?  The boyfriend says, um, how am I supposed to know if I love my girlfriend unless I compare  her to something?  You know?  So are you, are you then saying?  I mean, it's like, it's like, how am I supposed to even attempt to claim love for my girlfriend 
[02:24:30]  unless, um, I, I, uh, compare her to something and actually go on to feel guilty?  So you want to kiss her, Steve-O?  Is that what you're saying?  You sound like PJ.  I'm just saying that they, they, uh, have a distorted sense of, um, purpose?  Who does?  Is it, like, distorted because maybe they don't want you with somebody else?  Oh, now that's it, dude.  I'm just saying.  I'm just saying they're not drinking, they're not abusing illegal street narcotics, they are 
[02:25:00]  wearing way too much clothing.  Right.  They're not even smoking anything.  I hear you.  All right.  You know, I mean, how, how, how are you supposed to know if you love, if you love, you know?  Steve-O, man.  All right, dude.  Open up the lines.  I want, I want a really good person to tell me what to staple to me.  I'm a bad person.  Well, we got to staple some stuff.  Todd, what's up?  I want haters.  Hey, Todd.  Steve-O, what's up, man?  Yeah, dude. 
[02:25:30]  Dude, you remember me, man?  Probably not, man.  Where?  Where from?  Uh, I came to saw you Peabody doing what's in the after party at the Spaghetti Warehouse.  Oh, all right.  Right on, dude.  And you did the shot out of it.  You're not that homo, are you?  No.  You were the one grabbing my nuts, man.  Uh, okay, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Are you the dude who we actually stapled on the dollar to your face?  No.  Uh, but you were there that night when we did that.  I don't know, man.  You know what?  You did a shot out of a car.  You've done that?  Out of a crowd. 
[02:26:00]  Yeah.  Oh, no, wait, is it the arm shot, dude?  Yeah, no, I'm not him, but I was with him that night.  Oh, all right, so you were there.  All right, there were a lot of people there.  Yeah, there were some serious love triangles going on upstairs.  Oh, hey, anyway, man, I saw just one little quick glimpse of the video you got out.  Right on.  Is it still available, man?  Yeah, it's available everywhere.  Well, stevavideo.com.  How'd you get just a glimpse, dude?  Well, because it went on so fast.  It was on and off, plus I was half dead asleep, too, man.  But, uh, anyway, are you doing, like, another show with you guys or anything? 
[02:26:30]  All right, Todd, thank you.  Great.  Todd's having a private conversation with Steva.  Steva, let's staple stuff.  Yeah, I don't want to see that, man.  Let's get the grand finale going.  That's pretty twisted.  What do you say?  We know that we're going to drive industrial staples through my 70s bush.  Why don't we get Frenchie?  Let's make it like, hey, Steva.  I want a listener to call in.  Steva, can we get Frenchie to do it?  Hello, Frenchie.  Yes.  Yes.  You know, I'm like, I'm wasted, all right?  Die. 
[02:27:00]  I haven't slept in four hours.  Die.  I'm full of dogs and I'm wasted.  Steve, Frenchie's going to drop the stapler and surrender.  Yeah.  That's what the French do.  I'm going to get you ass.  Dude, he'll even hold a helmet in his mouth to make sure you don't get hurt.  It's tough because we know what's going to happen.  We know what's going to sound.  How does it work for radio?  Oh, believe me.  It'll work.  It'll work.  You know what it is?  Open up the line.  Dude, it works.  It's the anticipation and the snap of the sound.  All you're going to hear is a click and a lot of people yelling really loud.  That's all right.  Is there anything in there?  So, open up the line. 
[02:27:30]  Hey, hey, I want haters.  Hey, Paul, what's up?  Frenchie just stapled his hand by accident.  Frenchie.  Hold on, hold on.  Frenchie, pull that out, man.  I'll give credit to the meat of the hand, dude.  That's good work.  Ah, Frenchie stapled his hand.  No, don't do it again, you nut.  Yeah, boy.  You will never cook again.  Ah.  He's like, that's no big deal.  He is an actual dumbass.  The staple is you is now.  Yeah, he's from Finland. 
[02:28:00]  Hey, he's challenging you.  He's challenging you.  Is this guy from Finland or not?  He's from France.  Normally when they do that, they staple a white flag to their hands.  Walk into battle.  I actually don't see a lot of this.  I have a lot of people come up to me and they're like, oh, yeah, you're on Jackass.  Like, you do a lot of dumb things.  You know how you like to kick in the nuts.  You know, like, stuff like that.  Like, people are like, really trying to get in on it with me.  I do not see people this dumb very often.  Yeah, that's pretty good.  Well, Frenchy's great, man.  Thank you, Steve-o.  Yeah.  Thank you.  Thank you.  I actually think we might. 
[02:28:30]  Aren't you tired?  No.  This is not your average dumbass.  Right.  Never.  And I've got a little bit of an ego.  I'm going to go ahead and say, world-class, absolute moron.  Well, thank you very much.  So I'm saying between the two of us, we could probably write a letter to Guinness.  Yeah.  And actually, you know, I used to get drinks out of it.  What are you going to do to top what Frenchy just did?  God damn it, man.  We could get drinks out of it.  What are you going to do to top Frenchy there, Steve-o? 
[02:29:00]  Uh-oh.  What's the matter?  We're going to staple something.  She wants some cocaine.  Understandable.  Okay.  Understandable.  Oh, the turtle.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Here we go.  Yeah.  I want to apologize to all these poor listeners.  What is that?  They haven't turned the radio off in an hour and a half.  I just wore out my welcome back.  No, believe me.  Go ahead.  Go.  All right.  Now, I'm going to lay down on the ground.  Okay.  I'm not going to be proud.  I'm going to, like, let's see.  I'm going to lay down on the ground. 
[02:29:30]  I'm going to get, like, my lower back, like, my butt against the wall.  Okay.  I'm going to push my whole body, like, up the wall, like, with my butt cheeks against  the wall, getting higher and higher, like, with the top of my shoulders closer to the  wall so that my whole body, like, is just vertical, right?  Resting on my – now, I'm going to bring down my lower torso.  Okay.  Well, now, before I actually start stretching –  Let's just call it yam bag.  Yam bag.  Just to be safe.  Before I start stretching the sack, I'm going to have to, um – 
[02:30:00]  Wait.  All right.  What is it?  A surgery?  A slinky dick.  What do you call that little thing?  I've seen when you do that.  You know that thing, dude.  I know.  You've got to push your junk in on itself.  You make it look like a turtle.  Yeah, like a turtle head.  A turtle put in its head.  Yeah.  I'm going to push the wiener, like, all the way down.  All right.  Now, the wiener itself –  Anything you might refer to as shaft is not an issue.  Okay. 
[02:30:30]  At which point, I want to stretch my nutsack over the hidden wiener.  Right.  And you're going to staple it?  Staple the nutsack to my 70s bush.  Ouch.  And call it the turtle.  All right.  All right.  Do you need some help over there, Steve?  Now, there's no way this is going to work.  What is going on, Dave?  She is accosting you for that little vial, isn't she?  Yes, she is.  Hey, how close are we to a commercial? 
[02:31:00]  You want to do a commercial?  We're going to do a commercial, and Steve is going to do the showstopper next.  Okay.  I do believe.  Yeah.  All right.  We'll do the showstopper next.  More girls, more gooders.  Hookers for everyone.  You won't have it.  O.P.  F for me.  No longer will our penises remain flaccid and unused.  And we're back with the O&A show.  Man, we had so much planned for today. 
[02:31:30]  We really did.  We have Super Bowl tickets to give away.  We are not recanting.  On the turtle?  No welching.  We are not welching on any stuff.  And we were going to talk about Gay Kandahar.  We'll do it tomorrow.  It's all there for tomorrow.  Don't worry about it.  Format radio sucks anyway, right?  Yeah.  F it.  We didn't even do the 6 o'clock queep.  Is it 6?  I don't even know what time it is.  The clock is standing here.  Steve-O's head ripped it off the ceiling. 
[02:32:00]  Yeah.  I actually pulled the technology dive much.  That happens.  Nice one, Steve-O.  Dude, even my friends I came here with were bummed I did that.  You know what, though?  That's like...  You've got to explain, Ant.  That's a heavy-duty clock, too, man.  Yeah.  It's not a little...  Steve, those four screws, the side comes off, you slide it back on, put the screws back.  It has this entire foundation, which is separately bolted.  And it's all bent up.  Also, I should say, Ant, we have at least six, maybe as many as eight girls that have joined 
[02:32:30]  the Naughty Nighty contest today alone, most of their pictures are up on opianthony.com.  Washington officially representing in the Naughty Nighty contest.  Four more girls from Cleveland.  I think there's one from Buffalo.  And I think one from Boston is going to be up there very soon.  Steve-O, it's time to do the turtle trick, my friend.  This is my first time getting wasted and just hanging out in a radio studio.  Yeah.  Is there any kind of such thing as the radio wave?  Is there any way that you feel appreciation from listeners as mass? 
[02:33:00]  Through phone calls, through the feedback we get on the computer, we feel the vibes.  All right, well, now, like, I'm ready for the turtles.  Are you?  And it's a compromising position that, like, I mean...  People are saying, using things like, insane episode in radio history.  I'm reading that right off of one of those.  Well, I mean, like, I'm saying in my personal history, like, trust me, I've not really, like,  skimped or, like, cut corners in grading myself horribly. 
[02:33:30]  And this is a new level.  It is a new level.  I'm digging it.  I mean, like, we're not only stapling my nutsack in my body, we're doing it in a compromising  situation.  Well, let's do it.  I hear you.  And, like, we're...  Yeah!  Let's do it, Steve-O.  It's time.  It's time, Rhett.  It's time.  All right.  The previously unheard of before absolute hidden wiener.  Right.  The turtle.  It's time.  It's time.  Beautiful.  All right.  We don't know what got dumped down when he was explaining the trick. 
[02:34:00]  I was talking to my girlfriend.  She said everything went through.  That's nice.  Yes.  Everything went through.  All right.  So, you want to explain it again just in case people are tuning in?  Basically...  Steve-O is going to stand against the wall.  He's going to do the thing where you push...  He's going to be upside down, though.  You push your turtle head back into itself.  Right.  Pull the yambag skin up...  Right.  ...and staple it into his 70s muff.  Right.  Which will then lock it in.  Right.  And cover it over like a virtual clamshell. 
[02:34:30]  And Steve is...  Steve from FoundryMusic.com.  Videotaping for the website.  You'll see this later.  Ouch.  With let me pull back to get plenty of room.  Wait a minute.  You're going to do it over there?  You're doing it there?  The wall.  All right.  You need the wall.  That's true.  You need the wall.  You know what?  Can we...  Nah.  It would be nice to get a little mobile mic over here that we can plug in.  All right.  Hold on.  Put a mic on him.  Here.  Let's get a mic real fast.  That's a wiener.  Hold on.  That's a wiener.  Well, go back.  All right.  Wait.  Hey.  Everyone move down a mic. 
[02:35:00]  No.  No.  No.  You're going away from it.  I have to hold this mic later.  Oh, I see.  All right.  Look.  Look.  Okay.  Okay.  Steve.  Steve's...  I think he's nuts, man.  Look.  I can't watch this.  No.  Oh, my God.  He's pulling it.  That's why I'm upside down, dude.  He's pulling it over.  It looks like a tumor.  He has completely hidden his junk with the skin of his yam back.  Get the staple gun.  I'll do it.  Yeah.  Get it, D.  D.  Oh, my God.  D is going to do it. 
[02:35:30]  She'll do it right through one of the...  D doesn't even know where she is.  All right.  Here it is.  Do it topless.  Yeah, do it.  Oh, my God.  He's...  Wait.  He's on his back.  Well, D's naked behind you.  Hey, hey, hey, what's up?  Oh, yes.  All right.  All right.  He's upside down.  His wiener is completely...  Oh, my God.  Are you kidding me?  Wait a minute.  D is...  No, man.  He's in front of Steve.  Steve's upside down.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Oh. 
[02:36:00]  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Is it attached?  It is attached.  It is attached.  Oh, my God.  Everyone's running in to check this out.  Are you...  No.  Yeah.  And Steve-O's back up.  Is it...  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Oh.  Ladies and gentlemen, this is a turtle.  The turtle.  Jesus.  And Dee's proud of herself.  Congratulations, Dee.  Now, what some people might think is humiliating and degrading like others might consider a stunt. 
[02:36:30]  All right, Dee?  That is the sickest effing thing.  We've seen a lot in this studio.  That's the sickest thing officially, right there.  Holy Jesus.  Hey, Dee, I didn't come here to waste your time, man.  No, you didn't.  No, you didn't.  I'm sorry.  There you go.  Steve-O.  I'm totally playing out the staple gun, dudes.  Don't worry, dude.  Dude, that is killer.  We videotaped it.  It'll be up on foundrymusic.com later today. 
[02:37:00]  Right, Steve?  Stapled it to his yambic.  Pube bone.  Ouch.  And I need it to my hand, and it hurts like hell.  All I want you to have, yeah, dude, if I got one last serious thing to say at all, it's  to like, all right, this is fun and games.  Like, we're on the radio.  Wow, what a dumbass I am, you know?  Like, I've been on television plenty.  Like, I didn't even ask to be on television that much.  Right.  But I just wound up on television for the last few years. 
[02:37:30]  Some people wanted to see, man.  Yeah, I wound up enough on television that I just learned for myself what isn't allowed  on television.  And what I learned over the last few years of being on television, literally, I mean, I'm  not even bragging.  I'm just saying I deliberately did horrible things that would never, ever be allowed on  television.  Yeah.  And I took pleasure in it, dude.  You did?  Yeah.  A certain pride in it, Steve?  Yeah, a certain pride I don't really, like, share with my dad or nothing. 
[02:38:00]  But I'll distribute the hell out of it.  Yeah, yeah, well...  And MTV is not really, like, stoked about it.  Well, whatever, dude.  They're not?  Have you heard from anybody over there?  It's a side project?  No.  No?  Hold on.  My shady attorney needs to tell me to stop.  Oh, oh.  He's waving you off, dude.  He's waving you off.  Just drop the line.  He's waving you off.  I love you guys, and I love MTV.  Very cool, man.  I just love all the darn narcotics keep flowing through your studio, dude. 
[02:38:30]  Someone said the DEA is going to come up here and...  Bust everybody.  Hey, really, like, it's been way too long.  Wow.  Yeah, we'll get you out of here.  Well, it was supposed to be like a 15-minute interview turned into a three-hour insult.  Thank you.  A three-hour party.  All the dumb people that just had to hear how bad it was going to get.  Hey, just thank you.  All right, get DM, Mike.  Grab Frenchy's mic. 
[02:39:00]  And get DM, Mike.  Get Frenchy's mic over there.  Hey, it's Steve-O.  Go to Steve-O.  Go to Steve-O.  Steve-O-Video.com.  Steve-O-Video.com.  Or call 1-800-263-8122.  And you could order Don't Try This at Home, the Steve-O video.  Pretty much all the stuff that MTV would not show as far as the Jackass show goes.  Pretty.  And we'll have that info up on our websites later on.  Nudity.  It's Seth.  I don't even show my family.  Yeah.  I mean, like, there's no way.  Even though my dad ordered.  No. 
[02:39:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Hi, Dave.  I'm bummed when he gets it, dude.  Oh, my God.  He helped me negotiate the frickin' contract to distribute it in the first place.  He's going to wave you all up again, Steve.  I'm so bummed for when it arrives in this mailbox.  Nice.  But hey, man, I did this for the world, all right?  All right.  Yeah.  God damn.  Beautiful job.  Steve-O.  Nice.  Thank you so much.  His girlfriend, D.  D, thank you. 
[02:40:00]  Woo.  Woo, woo, to D.  Yay.  I'm just excited that you didn't know D during our watch.  That's great, man.  Take it easy, D.  All right.  Bro.  They're leaving the studio.  Great job, man.  Yes.  Let me go to the phones here.  Tom, you're next on the O.P. and Anthony show.  What's up?  Oh, my God.  Hey, Tom.  Best show ever.  Hands down.  Tom, wait till you see the video on foundrymusic.com of him slicing his own tongue earlier. 
[02:40:30]  Unbelievable.  The tequila trick.  He did like three or four things for us.  No, more than that.  He jumped over the console.  He must have did like five things for us.  Greatest show ever.  You got a good video for foundrymusic.com later, Steve?  That's easily an hour of great video.  Right on, though.  It's like August or tonight.  Hey, what's...  Go ahead, Tom.  What's the name of the video they did when they lit the car on fire?  The rent-a-car?  Oh, yeah.  I think that's on...  Oh, yeah.  I think this is on the DVD.  Is it?  Yeah, I think so.  That was a good one.  All right. 
[02:41:00]  All right, man.  Is Steve-O still there?  He's kind of wandering around outside.  Wow.  Rehab's for quitters, brother.  All right.  Later.  He's out there.  Yes.  Wow.  He's the real deal.  What a day.  I have never seen such blatant abuse of narcotics in my life.  And booze, too.  That is fantastic.  Wow.  That guy's sick.  Sick?  Sick.  There's no word for that.  No.  That's great stuff.  Amazing.  That is great stuff. 
[02:41:30]  Amazing.  Who in their right mind would staple their nutsack anyway?  Unbelievable.  I couldn't look.  It just looked too painful.  Uh-oh, you're back.  Hey, Norton, what did you think of the yam bag show?  It was great.  Natalia.  You know, when do you see stuff like that?  Yeah, what's up, guys?  Hey.  I'm sorry if my phone cracked me out.  I just wanted to say that was the most amazing show I've ever heard in my whole life.  Yeah.  Rock on to street narcotics.  That dude's freaking awesome.  Can we open the lines to some haters? 
[02:42:00]  Well, we're trying to have any...  We're trying to find some haters, but it's all...  Oh, that's cool.  Uncle John, what's up?  Hey, guys, should I apply for a position of drug dealer for Steve?  I want to retire by March.  Wow.  Wow.  All right, Uncle John.  Later, guys.  Peace.  You got a passport, dude.  Hey, Bobby, what's up?  Yo, guy, what's going on?  Hey.  The sound of that staple gun clicking was the greatest thing I've ever heard in my life.  Wait till you see the video later tonight.  Oh, I'll be pounding on that website later on tonight, guys. 
[02:42:30]  Damn.  All right, cool.  Later.  Bye.  I'm not even leaving, man.  I still have alcohol.  All right.  I haven't even talked to a hater yet.  No key, what's up?  Oh, Lord, do I have a great joke.  Oh, yeah?  Oh, man.  No key.  This is going to ruin everything.  Go ahead, Steve-O.  What's your joke?  Look at his people.  His people are like, what are you doing, man?  Everything's great, man.  My gangster manager and shady attorney are trying to stop me.  They're not digging you. 
[02:43:00]  They want you to leave so bad.  What's going on, Steve?  I got a joke that I personally think is funny.  Let him tell his joke.  No?  No?  Well, you got to realize, as soon as he said, I got a joke, they're like, no.  Yeah, that's got to be a good joke, man.  I bet that's a real good goddamn joke.  His attorney's pulling him out of the stage.  All right, he's on that stage.  I'm surprised the attorney allowed him to do all that stuff.  That's what I was going to say.  And it comes down to a joke to say, no, we found our limit.  I was going to say, wait a minute. 
[02:43:30]  After everything he's done in this studio, between the drugs, the freaking staple things,  the cutting, everything else, the lawyer steps in and says no to a joke.  Your priorities are a little scary.  Yo, what's up, man?  What's up?  Nah, listen, congratulations on the interview with Sid and Nancy.  I think it was the greatest thing I've ever heard in my life.  Yeah, it's the new Sid and Nancy, man.  All right, man.  Have a good one.  All right.  There he goes.  Why don't we take a break?  We'll come back and wrap up this mess.  Absolutely fantastic. 
[02:44:00]  We'll have to wait until tomorrow to talk about Gabe Kandahar and about how you can win tickets to the Super Bowl.  Yeah.  And possibly going to Boston to broadcast live Friday.  All right, what do we learn next?  O.B.  And Anthony.  Wait two minutes.  We'll say something really dumb.  Let's bring in the incest couch.  N-E-W.  And we're back to the O.B. and Anthony show.  Hello.  What a mess. 
[02:44:30]  Love it.  Yo.  Yo.  I love it.  I guess we could play.  What did we learn on the O.B. and Anthony show today?  Steve-O's still hanging out.  He doesn't want to leave.  They're trying to get him out of the building.  He does not want to leave.  Nah.  Nookie, what's going on?  Nookie.  What up?  What's up?  I want to tell you what I learned today.  Yeah, go ahead.  I learned it's not about the money.  It's about the meat socket. 
[02:45:00]  That's right.  Very good.  Words.  Words.  Later.  Let's go to Turkish.  Turkish, what's up?  I learned you don't need the 6 o'clock clean 4 gig handle on Steve Wilson's studio.  Oh, yeah.  Later, guys.  We'll do that stuff tomorrow, I guess, right?  Again.  You know, we knew we were going to have a fun time when he showed up.  But, my God.  He did, like, five things for us.  All the clips will be up on foundrymusic.com later today.  Then you go to opiananthony.com and see the latest contestants in the Naughty Nighty Contest. 
[02:45:30]  Right.  Mike, what's going on?  Rocking show today, boys.  Thank you.  Oh, yeah.  I learned that Pharrell doesn't analyze football games.  He analyzes people's sisters.  Yeah, I forgot that.  Pharrell was on the show today, too.  Cool.  Later.  All right.  This was the easiest show that we have done in a while.  Oh, hell yeah.  Just sit back and watch the madness.  Cornelius.  Good evening, gentlemen.  Hey.  I believe once upon a time, I hope you wanted to know what it would take to get me to turn 
[02:46:00]  the radio off.  Yeah.  It's a toss-up.  Hey, you can't curse, you idiot.  You can't curse.  You can't curse.  I'm sorry.  Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.  You're cursing.  You're cursing.  Get up.  You twat.  All right.  Basically, this guy doesn't like Frenchie, who's in the studio.  Why not?  Why'd you choke on the mule, you whore?  Why didn't you drop dead, you sissy, Mary?  Yeah, yeah.  Die, you whore.  I've heard better.  You twat.  You're a stupid slut. 
[02:46:30]  Well, I must say, that's rather...  How are you, faggot?  How you doing, you stupid country?  Why don't you get to take your head?  Die.  Go swim in a pool and try to breathe underwater, you stupid F.  I bet you, Mr. Frenchie, could really take a lesson by stippling that other gentleman's  yem bag.  Suck it, you whore.  Sir, Frenchie is trampling you.  Yeah. 
[02:47:00]  Do you really think I can?  Suck it.  All right.  That's not even a fight today.  Thank you.  Yeah.  Frenchie.  Wow.  If only they could incorporate that kind of gusto into their war.  Keith, what's going on?  Hey, I learned that in another half hour, we could have heard somebody have a heart attack  right on the air.  Who needs Dana Plato?  I'm just so glad no one passed out.  Who needs Dana Plato?  That's good.  That's good.  I'm just glad no one passed out during our watch.  Now, that would have been good.  That would have been the final stunt.  All right, Keith.  Thank you.  Let's go to Kenny. 
[02:47:30]  Kenny, you're next on the O.P. and Anthony show.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Well, I learned today, Steve-O's next trick would probably have been the Chris Farley  overindulgence face down the hotel room floor death trick.  Yeah, that's a good trick.  I can only do it once.  John, what's up?  Yo.  Yo.  Yo, John McKenzie, man.  I learned so much today.  And the worst part is I can't even explain to anybody what I learned.  Yeah, exactly.  I love it.  All right, cool.  You know what the odd thing is? 
[02:48:00]  That girl, Dee?  Yeah.  Like, very hot.  But imagine having to deal with that on, like, a daily basis or, you know, you would have  to chain her in the basement just for effing purposes only.  Wait, you going out with her?  Well, you don't get emotionally involved.  Well, that's it.  But, you know, you're just understanding what you're getting into.  Then again, what woman shouldn't be chained in the basement for effing only?  I'm just thinking, like, you know.  Norton was here today.  Her dude is Henry Rollins. 
[02:48:30]  That's her other dude.  Look, if Henry's listening, because we are all over the country now, we didn't know.  Ouch.  Whatever, man.  Wow.  Just feed the lines of coke and you're fine.  All right.  Thank you.  All right.  Let's go to Rich.  Hey, Rich.  What's up?  Yeah, I learned that industrial staples and yambag equals good ratings except in D.C.  Except in D.C.  I think they're warming up to us in D.C. a little bit. 
[02:49:00]  Yeah.  We even got a girl to do the Naughty Nighty contest in Washington.  Yeah.  Things will look good.  All right, you guys.  Ruled, Norton.  You're the best.  Thank you, sir.  All right.  Let's go to Jimmy.  Jimmy, what's up?  Jimmy.  Jimmy.  Hello.  Jimmy.  Maybe that's not his real name.  Who's the guy that usually listens for an hour?  Say hi.  Hello.  Hey, what's your name?  Kenny.  Kenny.  Kenny.  Hey, who's reading the phone?  No, I usually only listen for about an hour on the way home from work.  I'm in D.C. 
[02:49:30]  Yeah.  I washed my car.  I vacuumed the inside.  I've been going nuts with the Steva.  Ah.  Man, when I heard that stapler go off, my yam bag wrapped around my prostate like an octopus on lunch.  Isn't that something?  Oh, man.  I've got to give him an open invitation any time he comes back to New York.  Yeah.  Well, yeah, he's always invited.  Oh, yeah.  You guys rock.  All right.  Just wait till you see the video.  I haven't hung out with someone like that in so long, man. 
[02:50:00]  Like years ago, that was like the people I hung out with.  Like that?  Dude, I swear to you.  That guy's in his own league, man.  I would like to act like that.  The coke, the booze, don't even.  Don't even.  How many guys do you know that are going to staple the delicious yam bag?  You were celebrating before.  Hey, listen to Steve-O breaking the light bulb.  We got the audio.  Oh!  Breaking it over his head? 
[02:50:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  With a bottle of tequila.  And then him eating the glass.  All right.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Oh, my God.  Holy Jesus.  I'm going to wash this.  That rocks.  Now, the key is in having it still be crunchy when I swallow it off.  Are you ready?  With the tequila.  Are we getting the crunch factor?  I'm just getting your tongue a little bit.  All right.  Cheers, guys.  I'm glad to be here.  Wash it down with tequila.  More tequila. 
[02:51:00]  On that tongue, that's got to burn the cut.  The tequila's got to burn the cut.  Yeah, it's really...  That's real.  God damn.  Dude, that was after he sliced his tongue.  I'm not saying, like, you know, I'm not even trying to compete with the shenanigans that  he does.  Norton, if I may use the word shenanigans.  But, no, when I was younger and stuff, that thing, like, blowing off the artillery cap  in the school field and almost killing myself that way. 
[02:51:30]  But the Coke and the booze like that, like, those are people you just would hang out with.  I've seen...  But then years go by and you realize, hey, I think that stuff might kill me.  And then you stop doing it.  I've seen some things, but, man, that guy's in his own league.  I'm telling you.  Yeah.  Zanax.  Hot.  Zanax.  Hot chick.  He did at least...  He was effing Henry Rollins.  That's enough of a threat to your life.  He did at least ten shots of tequila, a bunch of beers. 
[02:52:00]  I mean, he's crazy.  I think he's got a drinking problem.  Let's go to Tony.  Tony, what's up?  Hey, you guys.  Over here in Cleveland, man.  What's up?  Oh, cool, man.  I'm about to cry because I'm going to miss Dee so much.  Oh, God.  I was falling in love with her.  Dude, did she sound young?  Doesn't she sound young?  She sounds like worth fighting Henry Rollins for, man.  Good luck.  Good luck is right.  Yeah.  And you know what?  Insane Henry Rollins coming after.  I'm not going to be able to sleep because I know the joke that the lawyers wouldn't allow 
[02:52:30]  is going to be the best joke I ever heard.  It was really good.  You know what?  We'll tell it tomorrow.  How's that?  All right.  Cool.  I'll tease.  Well, whatever.  It was kind of sick.  Jason, what's up?  Man, I learned that I'm not the only one that's a sick, demented person.  No matter what, there's only somebody out there that's more sick and demented than you.  Frenchie knock it off.  All right, Jason.  What is it?  What is it?  You, Rick?  Yeah, you dick.  Rob from Jersey. 
[02:53:00]  I learned that Steve-O was the craziest mother effort to ever walk the face of the earth.  I thought when he cut his tongue, I thought when he cut his tongue was bad, but when he  stapled his yam bag, I almost defecated myself.  Yeah.  Chris from Manhattan.  I learned that it's not about the money.  It's about the meat socket.  What I learned today, there will be a new favorite sound clip tomorrow.  Just stop it.  You have a mule.  Oh, Rick, you've got to get this clip for tomorrow's show.  That is disgusting.  Oh, my God.  Dee's saying, you have a mule?  Yeah, that is one of the best ones.  Sheep Glover from Jersey.  I learned today, it's easy to spell D.  And Sheep Glover also writes, I learned today, hotness always negates dumbness. 
[02:53:30]  The funniest part is, isn't D-D-E-E?  Yeah.  She goes, I can spell my name.  D-D.  Let me go to Mike.  Classic.  Mike, what's up?  Yeah, man.  Hey.  Hey, I learned that you can staple your nut sack.  Yeah.  You can eat glass from a light bulb, cut your tongue-court tequila over it, but you can't  tell a joke that a scumbag lawyer won't let you tell.  Don't tell a joke, though.  Don't tell a joke, man. 
[02:54:00]  There's the problem.  All right, guys.  All right, bro.  Later.  You know what?  I'll be honest with you.  Rick, when you do it, it's...  Okay, okay, sorry.  It's effing turning my stomach.  It's like making...  It's giving me like the heebie-jeebies.  I didn't even know that was him.  It's disturbingly disgusting.  I thought it was a clip.  I swear to God.  When you look over and a hot chick is doing it, it's funny and amusing. 
[02:54:30]  You doing it is like so goddamn disturbing.  There's not even words for it.  All right.  Enough, man.  That was Frenchy.  Hey.  No, that wasn't me.  All right, listen.  We didn't even get to do the FU line.  Well, when Frenchy does it, it's kind of hot, too.  All right, listen.  Figots.  Dudes and dudettes, we got so much stuff.  Two days.  Whatever.  On foundrymusic.com.  Lots of video from today's show.  We got girls entering the Naughty Naughty Contest like crazy. 
[02:55:00]  Go to opiananthony.com for that.  Tomorrow, we'll talk about Gay Kandahar.  We'll talk about our trip to Boston, hopefully.  And more debauchery, I'm sure.  Oh, I'm sure.  We're going to leave you with a little tune from Stephen Lynch, our pal.  I hope they fix the clock.  Who's going to fix that, man?  I don't want to hear Pete bitch because, you know what?  I can't.  You know, this never happened when Scott Muni was here.  Look at the radio we got out of a broken clock.  That's nice.  It looks good like that.  Check out this tune. 
[02:55:30]  We'll see you guys tomorrow. </pre>
