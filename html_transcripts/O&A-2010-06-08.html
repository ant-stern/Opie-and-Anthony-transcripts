<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the hosts, Opie and Anthony, complaining about technical difficulties and their own performance.  Sam Roberts and Danny were in studio.  The show heavily featured discussions surrounding Joran van der Sloot's confession to a murder in Peru, with frequent, enthusiastic speculation from a contributor named Mars regarding Van der Sloot's potential involvement in the Natalie Holloway case.  This transitioned into a scathing and highly offensive critique of Gary Coleman's widow, Shannon Price, focusing on allegations that she took and attempted to sell photos of Coleman while he was dying.  The hosts repeatedly used highly offensive and vulgar language to describe Price.

A caller criticized Bud Selig's handling of the Armando Galarraga near-perfect game controversy. The discussion returned to Van der Sloot, exploring his potential sociopathic tendencies and privileged background.  The hosts then moved to Helen Thomas's controversial remarks about Israelis, with Mars contributing his own controversial opinions. A clip of Shannon Price's Good Morning America interview was played and heavily criticized, further escalating the hosts' use of offensive language towards her. A caller suggested a BP boycott, which the hosts dismissed as unnecessary given BP's already significant setbacks from the oil spill.  The segment concluded with continued discussion of Price's interview and offensive commentary, followed by a bizarre tangent about a mysterious package delivered to Anthony and a darkly humorous description of a gift shop at Auschwitz.

The broadcast continued with further discussion of Gary Coleman's death and Shannon Price's actions, again using highly offensive and vulgar language. The BP oil spill and the perceived inadequacy of the government's response were also discussed, along with cynicism about BP facing meaningful consequences.  A significant portion debated the new iPhone's features and compared it to other smartphones, punctuated with offensive language and jokes. Numerous callers phoned in, introducing unrelated topics such as Holocaust denial, boycotts of Auschwitz and the Anne Frank House, and random anecdotes. One caller described performing CPR, including details about handling dentures.  The hosts mentioned Alex Bennett, Howard Stern, and Colin Quinn.

A caller described a YouTube video showing white vans at Jacksonville Air Force Base, prompting wild speculation about a possible military evacuation or oil spill cleanup, even suggesting a government conspiracy involving Obama and martial law.  The hosts mocked the caller's paranoia.  The video's authenticity was later questioned and proven unfindable. The conversation shifted to cell phones (HTC Evo and 4G networks), then to a debate on The Who's merits, interspersed with music playing and jokes.  A listener then clarified that the vans were for a Special Olympics event.  Further calls included one from a listener whose guns were confiscated due to a past mental health hospitalization, prompting a discussion on gun control and mental health. Another described shooting a .50 caliber rifle, leading to further firearm discussions and an anecdote about a child shooting one. A news story about a child removed from honors classes due to the smell of olive oil in her hair prompted more off-color jokes and discussions about race.  Offensive jokes and language were frequent throughout.

The show opened a new segment with casual conversation, including a tribute to Dennis Hopper and a discussion of a biracial child whose hair allegedly caused a teacher to have an allergic reaction. Racial slurs were used while speculating about the child's hygiene.  The discussion moved to a Hallmark graduation card the NAACP deemed racist due to a perceived slur in the audio greeting.  The hosts played the audio, arguing it was a misinterpretation, while harshly criticizing the NAACP’s response using numerous racial slurs and offensive language.  A caller shared a similar story about a birthday card, furthering the hosts' outrage.  The hosts focused on the perceived overreaction to alleged racism, arguing that white people apologize too readily.  Further discussion about racial sensitivity, using racial slurs and offensive language, ensued. The conversation transitioned to a listener’s experience with a child’s Halloween candy and a clip of David Lee Roth discussing Van Halen nonsensically.  The segment concluded with more discussion about the Hallmark card controversy, calls from a concerned teacher and a Hallmark employee, and a discussion of foot fetishes and unpleasant bodily functions, interspersed with comments about celebrities.

The final segment began with a discussion of Dave Lee Roth's style versus class, using chili dogs as an example.  A debate followed about which bands remained "cool," mentioning Van Halen, Kiss, Motley Crue, The Cars, Judas Priest, and Genesis, touching on Rob Halford's sexuality.  A caller questioned Van Halen's heavy metal classification, leading to a humorous assertion that Jethro Tull was the greatest heavy metal band. The conversation shifted to Helen Thomas's forced resignation, debating the appropriateness of her statements and the consequences of expressing unpopular opinions, using offensive language.  President Obama's response to the BP oil spill was mocked.  Birthday wishes were given to Colin Quinn. The segment concluded with a comedic, vulgar, and offensive description of a hypothetical trip to the Congo.

[00:01:00]  Thank you. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  Thank you.  Our show is stupid.  This is so irresponsible.  This should be illegal.  It really should be.  It's like, it's so unethical.  God, I hate fucking radio.  This could be the worst audio ever.  Shut up.  Shut your fucking mouth.  This is terrible.  This is terrible.  This is terrible.  We just suck all around.  I hope you show restraint in fucking my girlfriend. 
[00:04:00]  This stinks.  Fucking shut the fuck up.  We got it.  We got it.  We got it.  But enough of this palaver.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Ah, good morning.  Ah, good morning.  Don't really need to turn three mics on yet.  It's Opie.  It's Opie.  It's Opie.  Anthony will be late.  I think 6.30.  He'll be here.  Jimmy will be late.  I think about 6.15 for him. 
[00:04:30]  So you got me.  Good morning to you.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  Hi, Sam.  Sam Roberts.  Hi.  Hi, Danny.  Hi.  What's going on, Danny?  Not much.  Hi, Club Show to Kenny.  Good morning, G.H.  Good to see you this morning.  Good to see you as well, sir.  Thank you.  It's good to be seen.  Hello, Mars.  This is called filler.  I go, Mars, I need someone to do the radio show with today. 
[00:05:00]  He goes, put me on mic.  All right, you're on mic.  What do you got?  Give me something.  Give me one thing today.  One thing today.  I need to stall for about 15 or 20 minutes.  Yeah, you can't repeat what I say as your thing.  Of course not.  We got this motherfucker that went ahead and said he did the crime, finally.  You suck.  Jimmy, will you jump on mic, please?  God damn it.  I went to Mars to help me out, and it was just a complete bust. 
[00:05:30]  Oh, my God.  What guy?  Versloot.  Versloot.  He said versloot.  He just said versloot.  Versloot?  We got the guy versloot?  The guy who did the crime.  Versloot.  The guy who did the crime.  Why are you excited that he confessed?  Who gives a shit?  Did he confess to who?  Natalie Holloway?  Yeah, he...  No, not that.  No, no.  The Peruvian?  The Peruvian broad.  He confessed to that murder, yeah.  Oh, wow.  Good, good.  Versloot.  Versloot?  They got him.  Yeah, Mars is very excited.  Why are you excited about this story, Mars? 
[00:06:00]  Yeah, just grab whatever, Mike.  I don't give a shit.  Yeah, because this son of a bitch...  It's not on.  It's on.  You're the engineer.  Wow.  He's the engineer, and he's wearing it.  He's the engineer, right.  You're the first person...  Because he got away with the first one.  We all know that.  Who?  What?  Holloway.  Holloway?  Yeah.  Who do you think killed her?  Versloot.  The guy who did the crime.  The guy who did the crime.  The guy who did the crime also killed her.  Yeah, and then in Peru, they made him talk, apparently, you know? 
[00:06:30]  I guess they have different rules.  Yeah, good.  They're not as polite in Peru.  Exactly.  No, he's confessing.  Her father was a pretty powerful guy.  They got him in Chile.  Is that Peru or no?  I don't know.  It's a different country, right?  I think...  That's how dumb I am.  Oh, wait.  He...  I think he took a cab or something to Chile, right?  And then they brought him back to Peru, and then he confessed.  Supposedly, this broad guy on his laptop, and there was some info on where Holloway was.  Holloway or whatever, right?  I didn't hear that there was info about where she was, but I think she found out that he 
[00:07:00]  was associated with...  Yeah, there was something.  That's what he's saying.  And then he freaked out.  He freaked out and said, oh my God, she invaded my private life.  She had to be killed.  So we got the guy that did the crime, right, Mars?  That's correct.  So that's one of the big stories today.  What a piece of shit this guy is.  I really was hoping he'd kill himself on the road.  You know what?  Probably not the biggest piece of shit of the day, though.  I'm going to give that to Gary Coleman's wife.  She is a piece of shit. 
[00:07:30]  She is.  She is.  I mean, the other guy, the who, Mars?  Versloot.  Versloot.  The Versloot guy, he's not a piece of shit.  He's a psychopath.  He's probably a serial killer.  Yeah, but he was...  You know what?  He was confessing to it kind of on videotape for money to a reporter.  He's been playing kind of cat and mouse with the victim's family.  He's a scumbag.  Yeah, they're picking him up on charges of, what, blackmail or something like that?  He offered...  He wanted $250,000 from Holloway's mama. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah, for information leading to where the body was.  And then, you know, he didn't give any information.  So they were going to pick him up on that charge.  Yeah, he's a real cunt.  He's completely fucking insane.  This Gary Coleman wife brought is a piece of shit.  Yeah, she's a little irritating.  What is she going for?  Is she looking for a little fame and a little payday?  Gary was probably a very difficult guy.  You know, he was probably a hard guy to be married to.  And there's probably a lot of resentment build up and a lot of annoyance. 
[00:08:30]  And that's personally why I feel that she would have pulled the plug fast.  That's my guess.  She's sickly now.  Is she?  Well, the poor thing.  She went to a Good Morning America interview in a wheelchair.  What?  Ew!  What was this, yesterday?  Yeah, well, it aired yesterday.  Yeah, she's confined to a wheelchair because of her seizures.  And she's prone to.  She had to break in the interview for a second because she thought she might have a seizure.  But she was okay. 
[00:09:00]  What a fucking attention whore she is.  Oh, you want to talk about that whole me, me, me thing.  Oh, dude.  She didn't want to help Gary Coleman because of all the blood.  And now we're finding out that she took at least three pictures while Gary was dying.  Two while he was dying.  And one when he was dead.  And then she ran off to try to sell him to the highest bidder.  And I think she got somebody.  Yeah, I think she did too.  And she's going to get in the low five figures.  So that's, what, $20,000, $30,000 maybe for the pictures.  There's scumbags for buying it too. 
[00:09:30]  What a piece of shit.  And you know what?  Well, you expect them to buy them.  Eh.  You know, I mean, we already know what they're fucking all about, but.  Yeah, she's terrible.  She's horrendous.  I think it was the last bit of money she could probably bleed out of that situation.  Right.  You know, it's fucking sickening.  Yeah, he didn't have a lot of money to begin with, so.  And she's not even hot.  The fucking guy's dying.  He's got tubes, and there she is, snapping away.  She said in her interview that they always talked, and Gary told her that he felt like 
[00:10:00]  dying wouldn't be fair to her.  And she brought that up in the interview as if to say, you know, it's not fair to me.  Ugh.  She raised a point.  Yeah, it's not fair because.  I want to feed her an apple out of my ouch's hand.  That fucking toothy animal.  Can I see a picture of her, Daniel, of her gums?  Can you find her gums?  You love the gums, right?  Oh, I want to fucking, I want to punch them in layers.  Yeah.  Let me go to Eddie in St. Louis.  Eddie, you usually talk sports, my friend. 
[00:10:30]  Yeah, actually, what I wanted to talk about, there's really not that much sports to talk  about except, you know, I guess it'd be nice if everybody watched the USA play England  in the World Cup, but it's interesting.  Why would that be nice?  Well, I mean, it's only once every four years, and hopefully we beat the shit out of those  limeys, you know?  I mean, I'd like to see people respect soccer a little more in the U.S., but good luck with  that.  They got their fans all over the world.  They don't need the United States.  Although, it's growing in the United States a bit, right?  I couldn't name one player on the U.S. team.  Not a one. 
[00:11:00]  Is Beckman playing?  Beckham?  No, he's injured.  I said Beckman.  Don't even get me started on him.  He's a piece of shit.  What he did to American soccer was horrible, but that's not really what I can hear.  Yeah, that's really bad.  More people started checking out American soccer because of him.  He kind of did a Pele thing.  I mean, not as big as what Pele did, but he sort of brought some attention to the sport.  Right.  Well, if you want to talk about Pele, there's a guy who's going to be playing football.  No, I don't want to talk about Pele.  We really don't, sir.  We want to talk about what you want to talk about before I distracted you. 
[00:11:30]  This is not an open forum on Pele.  Right.  Let's talk about the Civil War that stopped the day Pele arrived.  With that of respect for him, go, sir.  Forty minutes on it.  He probably has something on it.  I think it's interesting the last couple of years.  You have all these sort of young, I don't want to know if VanderSloot's a serial killer  or whatever, but how fucking crazy is this guy?  He got away scot-free with the Holloway thing, and honestly, I was pissed off at the news  media because they kept pounding that fucking drum when it was on the TV, but it went away.  And now the guy's back, so he must be like a hard-boiled sociopath. 
[00:12:00]  I think he's also a kid, a child of privilege.  A lot of these guys are, these children of privilege, they don't suffer like the first  time because his father got him out of it, so, you know.  They feel like they could get away with just about anything.  Yeah.  But, I mean, if he goes off and kills another broad like he did, I mean, how many other  broads did he kill that no one knows about yet?  You got to wonder that, first of all.  Second of all, I'm thinking serial killer, but we got him, right?  Right, Mars?  That's correct.  He's a done deal. 
[00:12:30]  He's a done deal, and that makes you very excited today.  That's the guy.  He's just a piece of shit.  He's a piece of shit that got away with a lot of shit in his life, man.  Like what shit did he get away with in his life?  You can tell he's a slight little fucking brat.  Yeah.  Got everything he wanted.  You don't like rich people, do you?  That's not true.  He's a brat.  He seems like a brat, right?  No, you're rich, and I love you, man.  I like the way he amended like into love immediately.  I love you.  How the fuck do you know I'm rich?  That's quite an assumption.  It really is.  That's really disrespectful.  What, did you open his laptop and see his connection? 
[00:13:00]  No, he said it a couple of times.  No.  I don't really talk about that.  He doesn't say that stuff.  No, really.  I give to the poor, Mars.  It's vulgar to discuss finances.  I hope he wouldn't do that.  I got stupid sweatpants on today.  Does this look like a rich man's wear?  It doesn't make you look rich, but it's not making you poor.  Why are you looking at my package, you fucking idiot?  Oh, he was.  He was.  What was that about, Mars?  Right full of rich cock.  Yeah.  What the hell was that about?  You should look at the leg of the sweatpants.  Why would you look at the package? 
[00:13:30]  You were looking right down at it, Mars.  You can't help it, man.  It's a big tent.  What?  A tent?  Opia's not erect right now?  What the fuck?  How dare you?  That's all I talk about soccer and murder.  Yes, sir.  Mars was just looking at my package, and he said, I have a big tent.  Could you take care of the situation?  Well, do you need some relief there?  Eddie, what else you got?  You're really not adding to the conversation this morning. 
[00:14:00]  I'm very sorry, gentlemen.  Do you remember Foxy Noxy last year?  That crazy bitch, the American student who went over to Italy and killed all those people?  Of course.  Did she do it, though?  I've also heard mixed things about her.  The one who just got convicted, right?  Wasn't she in a threesome or something that went horribly wrong?  Yeah, something like that.  But I like to think of it as she was the puppet master in that situation.  I'm also taking questions in any sports you want to talk about, Opie.  No, I think the Blackhawks are going to win the Stanley Cup.  What do you got on the Lakers-Celtics?  What are you thinking?  It's going seven games? 
[00:14:30]  Well, I mean, I was getting my broom ready.  I was hoping the Lakers would sweep them.  But obviously, you know, when you have two teams whose starters are that good, it's going  to come down to bench production.  And when you look at the Celtics, they have such a better bench.  But I don't think it's going to go seven games.  I think the Lakers are hungrier for it, and I think they're going to do it.  A stronger team?  I don't know about that.  I mean, basically, whatever you say on paper.  I don't think the Flyers are done either.  I mean, I could be wrong about that.  I mean, the Blackhawks beat the shit out of them the other night. 
[00:15:00]  But, you know, that's hockey.  I mean, if everything was supposed to go according to plan, the fucking Capitals would be going  for the Cup right now.  You got that right.  All right, Eddie.  And also, as we're doing sports here, I guess Bud Selig says that he doubts he will expand  instant replay in 2010.  What a fucking huge car salesman.  What a jerk-off.  And is comfortable with his decision with the Galarraga story.  Fucking hate him.  He's calling the whole ordeal a great story.  It's not a great story because it has a horrible ending, you cock.  He is a cock. 
[00:15:30]  Why won't he expand replay in 2010?  Why won't he give the guy a perfect game, just do the right thing, and get some nice  PR for baseball and Major League Baseball?  Because there's enough baseball fans that will go, the rules save me.  And because baseball fans are dummies, and they will just keep going to games, keep complaining,  keep getting fucked, and that's why.  I blame Detroit for giving up so easily.  You don't hear a buzz on this thing anymore.  It was like hot for a day, two days, and then it went away.  And Bud Selig, he thinks he's greater than the goddamn game. 
[00:16:00]  And he's like, well, if I do this, then I got to look at past calls and all that.  You're the main guy.  You go, look, I'm making an exception.  I'm not looking at past calls.  I'm not looking at future calls.  I'm just going to decide on this.  And I think this is a great story.  And everyone knows that it should have been a perfect game, so I'm going to give it to  the kid.  End of fucking story.  He's a coward.  He is a coward.  He's a piece of shit.  I mean, do you remember the way that the pitcher reacted when the umpire blew the call?  He had this smile on his face like he was fucking lobotomized.  I don't understand that.  Well, he couldn't believe it. 
[00:16:30]  He was in shock.  It was humiliating.  Yeah, absolutely.  He was probably embarrassed.  Because it was a routine play, too.  It was a routine play.  So the whole time, he's sitting there like, holy shit, I just pitched a fucking perfect  game.  And then Jim Joyce there blew it.  Yeah, and there he was.  I think he panicked.  I'm like a little bitch.  I bet you Jim Joyce saw it correctly, but just panicked and put the wrong fucking sign  up.  Went out when he meant to say out or something like that.  I don't know.  All right, Eddie.  That's it for you today, brother.  Thanks, buddy.  Have a good one. 
[00:17:00]  All right.  Let's go to Nate in Little Rock, Arkansas.  Nate.  Yeah, we were talking about Gary Coleman before.  And his wife, what's her name, Shannon Price, I think she's going to get in a lot of trouble  because Mr. Drummond has a lot of money and Willis is going to be pissed.  So I could see a lot of legal action happening to this broad.  Can you?  Something's not right with this broad.  And Mr. Drummond is a very rich man.  Something is not right with this broad.  We said it from day one when this all came about.  What do you think, Mars?  Oh, shit. 
[00:17:30]  Not a thought in his fucking brain.  He's got to lunch somewhere.  What were you thinking of?  I think I need your help right now.  Mexican hat dance was just playing on a loop in his head.  What the hell were you thinking?  I was thinking about this bitch.  Actually, I was thinking about her and seeing how does she think she's going to get away  with all this, you know?  She's the last one that saw this guy.  He's downstairs.  I'm upstairs after, you know, a good push, perhaps.  Now she's selling pictures.  You know, she's got old things pointing towards her like, you're going to go to jail, bitch. 
[00:18:00]  For what?  For what?  She pushed him.  She just said she pushed him.  You can't just say she pushed him.  Don't push him.  You can't just say that.  We're a little suspicious.  My opinion.  Yeah, you should preface it with that.  It's a big difference.  Yeah, that's a huge difference.  We're a little suspicious of her, but we have no idea.  She was at the top of the stairs and he was at the bottom of the stairs, but we don't  know how the house is set up.  Exactly.  Maybe he pushed her up.  That's right.  Okay.  That's right.  He slipped. 
[00:18:30]  Huh?  Maybe he slipped.  Maybe.  We don't know.  I love the new bit, the news from Mars.  Yeah.  What else is in the news there, Mars?  Miss Helen Thomas making outrageous remarks.  What do you know about Helen Thomas?  Oh, good story.  Miss Helen Thomas is the prime reporter of the White House.  She's the one that always gets the first question.  Right?  She's been there since, I don't know.  Since when?  Since when?  Let's go.  According to what I heard in the news, she's been there before President Obama was born. 
[00:19:00]  And I heard somewhere else that she was there during the Eisenhower administration.  It's like a seven-year-old who gets news tidbits on the playground.  Well, Zipo is correct.  I didn't say it was wrong.  It meant the delivery of it.  I think he, he, I said he, but she does kind of look like a hey.  Uh, she's hung out with ten presidents, I believe.  Wow, that's a lot.  She's been part of ten presidencies down there in Washington.  But what's up with her, man, saying that shit?  What she's saying, I mean, this is what bothers me about Helen Thomas. 
[00:19:30]  You know, look, she's not a particularly fuckable woman.  But, uh, she's notoriously physically hideous.  Would you, would you do it for the story, though, Jimmy?  I might suck, I might let her suck my dick if she would let me hang out and meet some presidents.  You almost said I would suck her dick.  No, I was going to say I'd suck her pussy.  I would let her suck my dick if she would let me hang out with her and maybe meet some president.  That's a joke, Jimmy.  I didn't think you actually thought she had a dick.  No, it's possible, though.  She really is a horrible woman.  Yeah.  But I actually, you know, I like Helen Thomas, even though I don't agree with her. 
[00:20:00]  Mm-hmm.  And, uh, again, it's another sickening fucking trend in this country is they ask someone her opinion.  She gives it.  The guy said to her, what do you think, what do you think the Jews should do?  Right.  In the Middle East.  And she said, I think they should get out of Palestine.  Right.  And they should go, and he goes, what do you think they should do then?  Well, I think they should go back to, she didn't say the Jews should be killed.  Right.  She didn't say fuck the Jews.  She has an opinion on that situation, which I don't agree with, but so what?  Yeah, a few people were outraged by her opinion.  Fuck them.  But that's fine.  You should be able to give your opinion.  It's because.  It's scary. 
[00:20:30]  More and more people aren't going to give their opinion because they're going to think they're going to get fired if it's a little too outrageous, what they're thinking.  We talked about it last night on Red Eye, and Andy Levy's like, well, don't you think, is there any line?  I'm like, but she didn't say anything crazy.  It's like, if she had said, I think the Jews should stay.  Right.  They're fine.  Right.  That opinion would have been considered outrageous to some people and offensive.  It's like, the whole fucking country is just full of liars.  Right.  We don't want to hear the truth.  We don't want people to be honest.  We want them to be honest if they agree with us.  Fuck everybody. 
[00:21:00]  And I think she's an old twat.  Mm-hmm.  Mars seemed outraged by her comments, though.  Were you outraged, Mars?  What did she say, Mars?  Do you know?  Well, my rule of thumb is, you don't fuck with the white people, and then secondly, you  don't fuck with the Jew.  I respect that.  That a boy.  You respect that.  Yeah.  I like that.  I like how his head was bowed.  Yeah.  He said that.  How old is she?  She's in her 80s?  89.  If you're 89 and you can't speak your mind, what the fuck are you doing?  So she's been doing this for over 50 years, and this is how she has to retire. 
[00:21:30]  I would assume she would have wanted to retire in a different way than being pretty much  booted from the White House and booted from the press in general.  Everyone turned their back on her.  Everyone.  Because they're all cowards.  Her agents are fucking despicable for walking away from her.  Walked away, right?  Nine Speakers Inc., I think they're called.  They walked away.  Right.  She didn't say anything that was terrible.  She just gave an opinion on that situation.  Mm-hmm.  I don't give a fuck if she has the center seat and asks the first question traditionally. 
[00:22:00]  She's a flaming liberal.  Everybody knows it.  She's honest about it.  You know?  She used to torture GW.  He hated her guts.  Oh, yeah.  So, you know, it's like she's been very consistent.  Let her say what she wants.  There you go.  The fuck cares?  That's too bad.  Right, Mars?  Should she have been fired?  Well, it's not so much...  It's her tone, the way she said it, man.  It was pretty, you know, like, with a lot of oomph.  Like, yeah, get them the hell out.  She meant it, yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:22:30]  She meant it.  That's how she...  But you know what?  She's a woman who, at least you could say this, she's informed about the situation.  She's been questioning fucking U.S. presidents face-to-face for 50 years, and that's the conclusion  she's come to.  Right.  So what?  I don't agree with it either, but too bad.  I don't have to.  It's not my fucking business.  Absolutely.  All right, Mars, listen to this clip.  I want you to tell us what you think of this one, okay?  It's Obama talking about the oil spill.  I was down there a month ago, before most of these talking heads were even paying attention 
[00:23:00]  to the Gulf.  A month ago, I was meeting with fishermen down there, standing in the rain, talking about  what a potential crisis this could be.  And I don't sit around just talking to experts because this is a college seminar.  We talk to these folks because they potentially have the best answers, so I know who's asked  to kick.  There you go.  Obama's going to kick some ass there, Mars.  What do you think?  Pretty strong words from a president, using a little bit of vulgarity there, using the 
[00:23:30]  word ass.  No opinion on it, though.  Oh, opinion on action.  Whose ass is he going to kick?  I guess the people responsible for the...  We're up to, I think, 50 days.  Whose ass is he going to kick?  He should be kicking BP's ass.  Pelicans.  Thoroughly, but I don't know what's going on there.  He's not, you know, I mean...  He should have been moved them out of the way and used the military to clean that up. 
[00:24:00]  What, just move BP right the hell out of the way?  Yeah.  Make him go fuck him.  The point is, he's not going to kick anyone's ass.  It's been 50 days.  He's not kicking anyone's ass.  He did fire one person already a couple of weeks ago, the head of...  One of the Pelican cleaners.  He fired them.  The head of energy, some shit.  They spent too much time cleaning the Pelican's vagina.  Everybody got suspicious.  It's clean already, Frank.  They had to fire him.  It was awkward for everybody else cleaning the Pelicans.  Yeah.  One guy took it a little too seriously. 
[00:24:30]  Everyone else had done like 11 or 12 Pelicans.  He was on the first one.  It was filthy, except for its vagina was sparkling clean.  All right.  Well, that's what's going on in the news.  Anthony's walking down the hall.  Oh, is he here?  Yes.  Look at that little sweetie.  How was Red Eye last night, Jimmy?  How was Penn Jillette on Red Eye?  He's great.  Did he get a word in edgewise?  Yeah, he's fine, man.  I don't mind doing it to you.  He has a way of taking over.  He does, but he's not...  Love him. 
[00:25:00]  Don't get me wrong.  I love the guy, but...  He does, but he's not a dick about it.  He's just kind of...  He's just...  That's Penn.  He's a loud guy.  Yeah.  So it was funny sitting next to him.  What'd I miss?  We're just sitting out talking about Penn, and I'm mentioning how much taller he is  than me.  Very tall, gentle.  And we look...  People say, I look like a ventriloquist dummy next to him on television, but he was  great.  It was a very fun episode.  He's not only tall, he's very large.  All his features are very large.  He has a huge head, but then he has huge arms, huge shoulders. 
[00:25:30]  Big personality.  He's a bit of opinionated guy.  He looks like a giant.  He looks like he should have been probably seven foot six, and he stopped at around six  eight, six nine.  If me and him hung out, I think we would probably...  We would wind up arguing a lot.  Oh, really?  But I love him.  I mean, I really do like the guy a lot.  Like, I didn't like him when I first met him.  Why would you argue a lot with him?  Because he's an argumentative guy, and so am I.  No, no, no.  Not even...  Really, you're not different?  No, we're fairly close.  I think that we would just argue because we're both argumentative guys.  Right. 
[00:26:00]  But I really do like the guy.  I didn't when I first met him.  Didn't you get into a little brawl with him here yet?  The first time, and over at K-Rock.  And then the next time I saw him, we talked a little bit.  I was like, oh, all right.  I like the guy.  And since then, I think he's great.  Yeah.  He just says what he wants to say, and he's a pretty...  He's not predictable politically.  He's not like a fucking annoying liberal, and he doesn't attack religious people just  for being religious.  You know, he's got a point of view.  He's an Obama fan, though, right?  Yeah, probably is, but I think he's more of a libertarian guy.  Like, he's a guy who's...  I don't think he's an Obama fan. 
[00:26:30]  I think he likes him more than Bush.  I kind of caught that yesterday.  I think he's kind of like less government.  I don't think he believes in these guys at all.  No.  Yeah, he might lean more Obama than like a Bush or something, but I don't think he's  like rah-rah Obama.  He said less government last night.  He said the smaller the government, the better.  Yeah, I didn't get that impression with him at all.  I think he's very liberal.  I think maybe he takes him as very liberal.  I think he was being sarcastic about his thoughts on Obama yesterday on the show.  It seemed to me like he was kind of, you know, Obama's doing a good job kind of a thing. 
[00:27:00]  I think that was sarcastic.  Really?  Absolutely.  That's what I took from it.  My guess would be more libertarian.  That was my guess with Penn.  I think he's even said that.  He's more of a libertarian guy.  That's odd.  You could see him talk so much on TV and have him interviewed here and still not know where  he stands on that.  We weren't really talking politics, though.  We were talking about all that other shit.  There's not many politics when you're talking about cheerleaders and martial arts.  True.  He said so many, like, you know, he kind of has pieces of both ideologies that he goes 
[00:27:30]  with.  You know what I mean?  He's not a flaming liberal.  He's not a flaming conservative either way.  I just wanted to say flaming twice.  Congratulations, Jim.  I said it twice.  I did it well.  So I had a good time with him.  It was fucking great.  Yeah, it was a really good episode.  Was the third person on with you?  SE Cup.  Oh, okay.  And, of course, Bill.  It was funny.  It was the first time I didn't sit next to Greg.  They made me sit.  It was Gutfeld.  Pen!  Jim.  And then they're like, we can't pen in the middle of the table.  It would have looked just freakish.  That would look silly, yeah. 
[00:28:00]  He would have looked like he was just a pedophile with a bunch of children.  They should have just lowered his chair down to the floor.  So you guys would be the same height.  He really is.  I was thinking, like, when he was talking here yesterday.  Like, he's a bright guy and he's loud.  Yeah, yeah.  So it's like, he's not.  And really big, but he's not saying stupid shit.  Like, he's saying bright stuff.  So even if you don't agree with him, it's like you've got to think to fucking argue with him.  But, man, I really would not want to see him in a rage.  Gutfeld's not exactly a giant either. 
[00:28:30]  That fucking pipsqueak.  He must have looked funny next to him.  Dude, he's 30 pounds lighter.  He lost 30 pounds.  Fucking, he's on some diet.  He looks phenomenal.  I actually rubbed his stomach and dick.  Yeah, Greg looks fucking great.  Wow.  Right on.  All right.  Why don't we take our first break?  Let Ant settle in.  And maybe you could open that package somewhere else.  That brown paper.  It's ticking.  Yeah, what is this?  I don't know.  It's very light.  Don't fucking open it in front of me.  I don't want to fucking blow up today. 
[00:29:00]  It's from Joran Vandersloot.  Yeah, that's...  Natalie Holloway's fucking cliff.  It's a vagina.  Right?  Anthony's got a very suspicious package in front of him, so...  Yeah.  In my pants.  When I'm not in the fucking studio.  I'll say it.  All right, we'll continue in just a bit.  Stay there.  We'll be an Anthony show.  Thanks, Jimmy.  You're welcome.  Oh, God.  Jimmy.  That's a little something for you.  Wow.  From me.  Thank you.  That's bad.  I dropped a little nervous stinker when I walked in. 
[00:29:30]  It sounded really, really bad when you let it go.  How do we turn this music down?  I don't know.  Are you travesting to it?  Cool.  Trap dog.  Wow.  That is a harsh one.  Ah, well.  Jesus.  Couldn't help it.  Were you nervous?  Yeah, I get scared.  The intern walked in and startled me.  And it fell out.  I heard on the news there's some roving band of robbers, again, on the north shore of Long  Island.  Well, you're prepared. 
[00:30:00]  They just take their liberties with our houses.  You're prepared if there's a roaming military.  A militia.  Yeah.  You're fine if there's an invading army.  Ant's got it covered.  What was it?  Yeah.  They're guys that go around, and I don't know, who's falling for this?  They're guys that go around, and they're handymen.  And while one guy is being the handyman, another couple of guys are ransacking your house.  It's the old distraction scam.  It's like, who knocks on your door and you go, yeah, come into my house. 
[00:30:30]  I have no idea who you are or what you do, but I could use a handyman today?  Like, if you need work around your house, don't you call somebody?  I can't comprehend it.  You don't just wait for someone to come to your house and then walk in with no credentials  or anything?  People are trusting, I guess.  You keep your eye on one person, and you don't keep your eye on the other ones?  Yeah, so then you're talking, because the one guy is supposed to be very charismatic  and very conversational, so he talks to you as the other two guys are just going through 
[00:31:00]  your fucking shit, going through your house, your jewelry, all kinds of...  Like, how do they get in your bedroom, and then they just ransack your place and leave?  And then you go, oh, I've been robbed.  I guess there's a special person you've got to look for to pull that scam with, but...  Anyone over fucking 78.  Exactly.  The dumb elderly.  The stupid elderly.  They do turn into real fucking blithering idiots, don't they?  They're the people that are supposed to teach you shit while you're growing up, and they 
[00:31:30]  do, you know?  And then they reach a point where they turn into idiot-trusting buffoons.  Yeah.  Close.  I don't get it.  Right before the old pillow bends their nose in the hospital.  Oh, he seems like such a nice...  Yeah.  Like they think it's fucking the 40s again or something, where it's like, I'm a handyman,  can I just come in and fix it?  I'll fix anything you need for a buck.  Oh.  What are their minds...  Is it the minds going, though?  Maybe. 
[00:32:00]  You think?  It might be.  Like, they don't...  There's just the, I'll trust you shit just pops in their head.  They probably grew up trusting more than we do.  Yeah, you got it.  It's a generation thing.  As...  Generational thing.  As you have conversations with people, though, in their middle age, they're not as trusting.  And then as they get older, they just turn stupid.  Let people in.  Ugh.  So how many of these home invasions?  One or two? 
[00:32:30]  No, they were like...  But they're making it out to be an epidemic?  There were four of them in the past week.  Really?  Yeah, like all in the same area.  North Shore, like Long Island.  That's where all the money is.  Nassau County kind of a thing.  You're not going to do it in Bayshore.  No.  No, you wouldn't do it.  If you're going to do it, you'll find, you know, a nice community to do it in.  That would be funny if they got robbed trying to rob somebody.  Yeah, handyman, come on in, motherfucker.  No, they were going out to the exclusive neighborhoods and wreaking havoc.  What was in the box? 
[00:33:00]  It's in the box.  Someone decided to send me some chips from a chip.  What's that?  No chip.  There's only one in the box.  A bunch of us in the box, we wouldn't be able to breathe, you know?  Yes, I understand.  Some pieces from a wall of a concentration camp in Germany.  That's a fucking creepy gift, dude.  Yeah, it's a little creepy, you know.  You're going to have to bury that in your backyard.  I've been...  All creepy gifts get buried in the backyard. 
[00:33:30]  No.  It's too creepy.  I don't want it on my property.  Like, I'm a fan of the era, as they say, and there are some collectibles that I have  and others I would like to have, but that is not one of them.  I really don't want to...  Laszlo was talking about going to...  He went to Auschwitz when he was over in Europe for a while, and he said, yeah, you go there  thinking, oh, this will be cool.  Go see some shit that you saw in, like, movies and stuff. 
[00:34:00]  And then he said, once you get there, that whole thing just leaves.  You're not entertained by it.  You don't look around, like, with this eager, I'm snapping pictures thing.  You just feel a very bad vibe about the place, which, you know, obviously there's a reason  to.  Boy, that Laszlo really, really is sharp.  He picked up a bad vibe at Auschwitz.  Yeah.  You'll be an FBI profiler.  Hey, you know, it might just be me, but I have a feeling something bad happened here. 
[00:34:30]  I hear the town is awesome, though.  I hear it's a nice party town.  It's a beautiful town right nearby.  Yeah, there's supposedly, like, clubs there and stuff.  A lot of art and coffee shops and nice restaurants.  Yeah.  I hear it's kind of a nice little area.  Yeah.  They built up around the horrific concentration camp.  Yeah, there's been a lot of people that have had problems with that.  The fact that they have developed the surrounding area as maybe kind of a tourist attraction.  And people are like, there's a line between never forget and let's let people in here 
[00:35:00]  and see what happened, the atrocities, and let's make, you know, a buck off of what happened  back then.  Yeah, Auschwitz hats really are.  Yeah, you don't want the hats and t-shirts.  You push the button, a little smoke comes out of the hat.  Do they have a gift shop?  I bet you they have a gift shop.  You think?  Does Auschwitz have a gift shop?  I bet you they have a gift shop, but they tone it down.  The stupid St. Patrick's Cathedral has a gift shop.  The empty cans of Cyclone B or something.  Yeah.  I know that's two very different things, but, you know, they can't help themselves. 
[00:35:30]  My grandfather went to Auschwitz and all I got was this lousy t-shirt.  You know, shit like that.  All I got was this lousy container.  Rub-on tattoos.  Someone call up.  It's still on it.  Someone call up.  I'm telling you right now, I bet you they have some kind of gift shop.  By the way, can I tell you the best part of this discussion is the way all of a sudden  the gift shop becomes the excuse to make horrific Auschwitz jokes.  Of course.  Well, no, we're just saying that's what's in the gift shop.  Just saying that's what would be in the horrible, horrible gift shop. 
[00:36:00]  That is comedy 101.  It really is.  It's the old diversion.  While we ransack your house.  It's the same thing.  I bet you can buy some shit there.  I don't doubt it.  I don't doubt it.  I bet they tone it down, obviously, but I bet you can buy a little trinket or two.  I bet it's not a gift shop like when you get off of Matterhorn Bobsled, kind of a thing  at Disney, but I'm sure there is a place where you can buy stuff.  They can't help themselves.  What do they have there exactly? 
[00:36:30]  All right, hold on.  Well, let me start with Christy.  Christy, what's going on?  You got something on this gift shop?  Yeah, I was visiting Krakow with my in-laws this summer, and my dad was like, let's go to  Auschwitz.  I'm like, all right.  Like, yeah, there's a gift shop with books, and I mean, it's not, you know, not like I  love Auschwitz t-shirts and stuff, but you know, there's books and historical, whatever  my dad bought, like he did the doctor, and he bought this medical mysteries, and kind  of like, you're a weirdo, dude.  You know what, though?  I mean, they start with the books, with a little history, and then someone's going to 
[00:37:00]  sneak in a little pin that says, I heart Auschwitz.  You watch.  And then they're going to be all in, just like Disney.  Um, I've loved you guys for 10 years.  I'm like a school teacher, but you guys...  Let's go to John in Jersey.  John!  Oh!  Hey, John.  Hi, Anthony.  Do you think they sell shirts that say, I survived Auschwitz?  Uh, yeah, that's next.  Okay.  It's the same thing, yeah.  They start off in books and educational stuff, and then they just go to the pure entertainment. 
[00:37:30]  They sneak a little pin or something, maybe like a pewter spoon or whatever the fuck  it's called.  I wonder if you could see where Amon Goert used to stand there and take shots at people.  Like, can you see that whole area?  Was that Auschwitz or no?  Was that another one?  I'm not sure which one that was.  I don't know where Schindler was.  Yeah.  I'm not sure which one that was, but yeah, that's, uh, a lot of that stuff has been torn  down, and, you know, but there's still a lot of shit there.  They have the guard tower where, um, you climb up, but then you water slide down, which  was, uh, very, very tasteless, I think. 
[00:38:00]  I don't think, uh, that was necessary.  Excellent point.  Yeah.  Let's go to Megan in D.C.  Megan!  Hey, um, you guys are talking about the bad vibe, and that reminded me of my father visited  Auschwitz with my mother when I was about 16, and he was not superstitious at all, but  he got stomach cancer right after that, and he always believed that it was from the  that visit, and he actually died of it, and it was just kind of weird, because he wasn't  like that.  He was very kind of...  He thought he got cancer from Auschwitz? 
[00:38:30]  He got cursed from the place?  Yeah, he did.  Yeah, he was Jewish, and he wasn't religious at all.  He was just a secular Jew, but he really kind of believed that on some level he did.  Oh, that he was, like, the last victim.  Yeah, no.  Well, I don't know.  I don't know.  I think so.  I'm sorry to hear of your tragedy, though, miss.  Yeah.  Yeah, I don't think that Auschwitz gives you cancer.  Well, that's what her father thought, though.  He's incorrect.  Well, I don't think it does, you know.  I'm just saying, like, I thought it was weird, because he wasn't like that at all. 
[00:39:00]  He was never superstitious or New Agey or anything like that.  Right.  All right.  Thank you.  Let's go to Whitey in Illinois.  Whitey.  Whitey.  Morning, gentlemen.  One of two.  How are you?  Jimmy, you're awesome.  Yes, I am.  Hey, my aunt went there, and she said they sell the neatest little ashtrays, but they're  full when they sell them.  Oh, stop it.  Ba-da-ba-ba-da-ba.  I didn't even preface it with some way to make it sound like you're not making a joke. 
[00:39:30]  Right.  Silly.  Jeff in, Huntington.  Jeff.  What's up, fellas?  How you doing?  Good, Jeff.  What do you got, man?  Yeah, I want to ask you guys your opinion.  I mean, I was there.  It was pretty eerie.  I mean, you walk in, you're on the railroad tracks, you see the sign.  If you work, you will be free.  You're set free.  I mean, cool to have a bookshop, a gift shop, or really not the right time to play.  Bookshop, I think, is acceptable.  Yeah, because that's educational.  Tasteful.  Yeah.  Yeah, I think good taste, you know, if you're selling trinkets, like cups, a shirt, that's 
[00:40:00]  shitty, but I think books are fine.  Yeah.  Yeah, because that's not really tasteful.  It's history.  You want to see it as it was, too.  Learn about it, right.  You want to see where you just were.  You learn what happened at that place.  Yeah, I agree.  I mean, as far as, you know, the gift shop, it was totally kind of, it was nothing, what's  the word I'm looking for?  Objectionable or sickening.  You know, I actually bought a couple of books.  I'm a teacher. 
[00:40:30]  I use those books in my classes.  There's actually a class where I teach called Alcott.  So I've actually found it pretty helpful, man.  Have a good day.  All right.  Thank you.  So that's it on the fucking gift shop in Auschwitz.  Auschwitz.  So it's on the fence right there.  We don't know.  Is it a gift shop, a bookstore, educational or entertainment?  You be the judge.  It's a gift shop.  We report.  You decide.  Do we?  Gary Coleman's ex was on GMA.  We've talked about this a little bit to start the show, but we got actual audio of this piece 
[00:41:00]  of shit.  She is one of the biggest pieces of shit to come out of Hollywood in quite some time.  I'd like to know if she's educated herself a bit or if people have gotten to her and told  her that her last interview didn't go over too well, didn't make her look too good.  No.  No?  Well, now it's coming out.  She took photos of Gary Coleman as he lay there dying.  Oh.  Didn't hear about this one?  Oh, yeah.  A couple pictures and one when he was dead and she sold it to somebody. 
[00:41:30]  She's got a death picture of Gary Coleman and she sold it to somebody.  I think she's denying it, but they're saying it's true.  TMZ got it.  Wow.  Reported it.  TMZ reported it, yeah.  I think TMZ's bummed that they didn't get it.  But you think the Enquirer bought it?  You think the National Enquirer?  Yeah, I mean, they have enough money to do that.  Enough money?  She only got low five figures.  That's not a lot of money.  It is Gary Coleman.  Some of these fucking photos, you could get easily six figures.  The death figure, though, I think the death picture that she didn't sell, it was just  him alive with her next to him in the hospital. 
[00:42:00]  Oh, they sold the...  You're right.  Okay, you're right.  Yeah, she sold the two or the three where he's still hooked up to fucking machine  and stuff and not dead yet.  I think she's a cunt on wheels.  Oh.  I think she has more of a responsibility in this than they're looking onto.  Yeah, I do too.  I think behind the scenes, there's investigations going on.  Call me crazy, but I really do think that somebody's looking into this.  Holy shit.  What an ass.  Who's Hiner is that, Dan?  Dan. 
[00:42:30]  Some CSI guy's girlfriend.  Oh, God.  Is that TMZ?  Yeah.  Is that interracial?  Yes.  Son of a bitch.  You don't like the interracial marriages?  No, not with an ass like that.  Damn.  God.  That bitch with that nice juicy cock.  No.  Well, here's Gary Coleman's ex on GMA.  I think this went down yesterday morning.  Oh, by the way, she was in a wheelchair, like Sam said.  She showed up at the interview in a wheelchair. 
[00:43:00]  What was...  She is...  Me, me, me.  She is cuckoo, man.  Would she come up lame?  That's funny.  Fucking horse face.  They did build a tent around her and a fucking shooter.  Hold on a minute.  Tom in Philly.  Tom.  Hey there, Tam.  Hey, I throw a challenge out to you guys.  And we accept.  Oh, yeah.  Listen to this challenge.  You know, with all the bullshit on BP, on how they screwed up the environment and stuff,  why don't you coordinate a boycott of all BP products? 
[00:43:30]  Why?  Why?  Because why should they benefit anymore?  How are they benefiting?  How are they benefiting?  They're losing billions.  Did you listen to yesterday's show when Penn Jillette was in here?  He explained what you're trying to do perfectly.  Because I guess there's a Facebook page.  Boycott BP and all this.  BP's company is getting destroyed.  You think they've wanted this to happen?  That's right.  11 dead employees and they've lost billions.  Yeah.  How is this helping them?  Yeah, not counting all the lawsuits that will eventually come of this. 
[00:44:00]  So why are we supposed to boycott BP?  Aren't they fucking themselves over?  Yeah.  Machinery breaks.  They don't need our help?  Machinery breaks down sometimes.  And things like this happen.  And it's terrible that I guess they're trying to fix it, whether they're inept or able to do it.  They're trying.  So why boycott, sir?  Because let the spirit of free enterprise reign and let the other oil companies benefit from them. 
[00:44:30]  I think they're going to benefit already.  Other oil companies are drilling in the Gulf, too.  You know what?  I've seen the BP gas stations.  I kind of go, yuck.  And then there's one right next door.  And guess what?  I pulled into that one.  Subconsciously, I just did that.  Some krill goes in your tank.  Right.  I don't need some dumb radio guy to go, hey, we all have to boycott BP.  I think in general we all have a bad taste in our mouth and we're not openly doing business with them.  And they're destroying their own company.  Are you pulling a man on us? 
[00:45:00]  No, this guy is dead serious.  Right, Tom?  You guys are the best in Howard rules.  Wait, you guys are the best in Howard rules.  Wait a minute.  See, that doesn't make sense.  But I guess...  Did he hang up?  Yeah, of course not.  And then he hangs up.  Because he's mad.  He's mad that we didn't go with his boycott idea.  God, you stinker.  I bet he got all nervous when he did that and had a hang up.  Oh, I did it!  Whoa!  You guys are the best in Howard rules and we love Bubba. 
[00:45:30]  How about we just made a good point and what do you have about our good point?  That's all he could say.  Instead, you panic and go with the dumb Howard thing?  Does Howard really rule at this point?  I'd love to see that on a debate.  A political debate.  Does he?  And what's your opinion on the war in Iraq and Afghanistan, sir?  And did you support funding for...  Howard rules!  I got you! 
[00:46:00]  And then he walks off stage.  He's still doing good radio, but he's far from ruling.  Rule.  I think the more important issue was that that man was a cunt.  I don't think the Howard ruling was the point.  The point was that man was a cunt.  Just listen to yesterday's show if that guy's listening.  Penn Jillette summed it up perfectly.  BP doesn't need our help.  They are fucking it up on their own.  Big time.  Big time.  I'm sure they're not sitting in the office going,  this is going just as we planned.  It will show in the end how much money these oil companies make 
[00:46:30]  because this won't hurt them in the end.  I know their stock's down and all that,  but it's going to show how much fucking money these big oil companies actually make.  BP will survive.  They'll absolutely survive.  They'll survive all the lawsuits, the stock going down, all that crap.  They made crazy profits last year.  Of course they did.  Crazy profits.  They can totally handle this.  Gary Coleman's wife, big piece of shit on GMA in a wheelchair yesterday, went down like this. 
[00:47:00]  She arrived in a wheelchair looking very frail,  and she stayed in that chair throughout the entire interview,  even having to take a break when she thought she might be having a seizure.  I've had a lot of health issues in the last two months.  As you guys know, I recently have seizures, and I've had a lot of anxiety.  I really miss my husband a lot, and I can barely get around, and I mean, it's been a trial.  She's got to just stop fucking talking.  Has anyone actually seen her have a seizure? 
[00:47:30]  She goes, as you guys know, I've had seizures recently.  Really?  Where?  Yeah.  Go ahead.  Show us.  Have one.  Prove it.  Yeah, have one in front of us.  Go ahead.  Let her rip.  And I'm really sad.  What is her deal, man?  It's a complete lack of emotion when she goes, you know, I'm sad about my husband.  No, you're not.  You can tell you're not.  Oh, God.  Someone ought to really, she ought to get a lawyer. 
[00:48:00]  She's really going to need a lawyer.  Some kind of coach just to tell her to shut the fuck up.  And what's what the, did she explain the wheelchair?  Yeah, she said it right in the clip.  Because of the seizures.  So I guess if she's in a wheelchair, the likelihood of her having a seizure is greatly reduced.  And falling down or something?  Oh, yeah.  I guess, yeah.  She doesn't want to bang her head.  Yeah, that would be ironic.  Yeah, because the world won't survive if she fucking passes on.  No, no.  Please. 
[00:48:30]  God bless her.  God bless her.  All right.  She continued on GMA yesterday.  You said, I've had a lot of speculation out there.  I've had a lot of people sit there and say, yeah, she pushed him.  People can say whatever they want, because I know the truth.  I would never hurt my husband ever.  I would, you know, take my own life before I would ever, ever harm him.  No, will you stop?  I hate when people say shit like that.  Without protesting too much.  No one's taking their own life.  Yep.  Yeah.  You wouldn't actually take your own life over his. 
[00:49:00]  You wouldn't go in there to fucking put a towel on his head.  Right.  When he was fucking dying on the floor.  Right, remember?  I would take my own life to save him.  You didn't do anything.  You couldn't deal with his blood, and you're going to take your own life.  Yeah.  So you should have taken your own life at that point, because he was still alive.  Right.  Oh, fuck.  Maybe if I take my own life, God will see that, and Gary will get up and walk out of  the house and get medical attention.  You never know, right?  What a dummy.  You know, take my own life before I would ever, ever harm him. 
[00:49:30]  Let me ask you if I might about the 911 tape.  I just can't be here with the blood.  I got blood on myself.  I can't deal.  You know, I was with him down there the whole time.  I was trying to find towels and stuff like that.  But yeah, seeing him in a pool of blood was difficult.  I mean, you know, if it was somebody else in my situation, I mean, I'm sure they wouldn't  know what to do either.  People do it all the time.  People do it all the time.  Do it either.  What you do is you get a fucking curtain if you have to, and you see where the blood's 
[00:50:00]  coming from, and try to stop the blood flow.  She's ready to kill herself to save him, but she can't even get near him to give him a  fucking towel to put on the back of his head, a little head.  Put a little head with a big gash on it.  A giant head.  Actually, a little body, giant head.  At one point, you had to make a decision about whether to keep him on life support.  The doctors advised me that, you know, it was grim, and, you know, he went into cardiac  arrest as well, and so the doctors advised me that this is the best thing for him. 
[00:50:30]  It was recently revealed that the couple, who were thought to be married, were actually  divorced back in 2008, just shy of their first wedding anniversary.  Explain to me how that is.  I mean, you guys had gotten divorced and then reconciled?  We decided that wasn't what we wanted.  We just had a disagreement, and after we both filed and it went through, we decided that  wasn't what we, it wasn't the right choice.  We were going to renew our vows soon, but our health issues got in the way, so we were unable 
[00:51:00]  to do that.  Oh, she's so, she's hateable.  She's beyond hateable.  I don't believe one fucking word she's saying.  I really don't believe one word she's saying.  She's fucking psychotic too, man.  There's no remorse.  A lot of lunatics in the news today.  Delusional.  And, uh, somehow she is going to make out on this.  She believes what she's saying.  She's one of those people.  She completely believes what she's saying.  Really?  You think she's one of those, like, lunatics? 
[00:51:30]  She's fucking nuts.  I think it's a little more calculated, and she's looking to turn a buck.  Hence the pictures that I wanted to see.  Get Don on the phone.  I'm not going to lie to you.  I mean, if there's a death picture of Gary Coleman, of course you've got to look at it.  Who's not looking?  But, I mean, you know, you've got to beat her up for being the piece of shit she is.  We have pictures from him in the studio that look like death pictures.  Jesus.  Yeah, I know.  That was great.  We probably could have sold those to somebody.  Get him while he's blinking.  I mean, your inner circle, though, taking pictures and fucking selling them to the tabloids, that's horseshit, man. 
[00:52:00]  Vulture.  You're a piece of shit.  And what's next for you now, do you think?  You know, I don't know.  It's up in the air.  I just got to go on with my life, and I got to be positive and think positive and get my health figured out and straightened out.  Go for him.  You know, I just hope Gary's happy and, you know, he's in a better place and he's not suffering anymore.  Little box.  All the health issues he's had over the years.  I'm just happy that, you know, he's finally peaceful and at rest. 
[00:52:30]  Oh, shut up.  We've discussed about death a few times, and he said it would be very unfair if he left me all of a sudden.  And, I mean, I really respect that, you know, because I loved him and he loved me, and, you know, we just can't live without each other.  Well, yeah, really, he's either doing fine snapping photos.  Yeah, really.  Fucking cunt shutterbug.  Really?  Put him in a little shoebox.  Nuts and bolts and whatnot.  Uh-huh.  Got yourself some money to, you know, do well for the next year or so. 
[00:53:00]  Well, how much he had at this point?  Oh, fuck.  He probably, he probably...  He couldn't have had that much.  He was working as security.  That motherfucker was Baroque.  Baroque.  I bet he was Baroque.  Uh, we got to get back to the Auschwitz.  Auschwitz, how the fuck do you say it?  I don't give a shit.  Dan in Smithtown.  Dan.  Dan.  Yeah, I'm actually from, originally from Iran.  I went to visit Auschwitz, and it didn't exist.  You're one of those guys.  Oh, I gotcha.  He's, uh, denying the Holocaust. 
[00:53:30]  Are you kidding me, Dan?  That's a joke.  Alex Bennett rules.  Alex Bennett rules.  Dan, don't hang up.  That's pretty good.  You're obviously not an Alex Bennett fan, right?  Uh, of course.  Come on.  I listened to him back in his 70s.  Honestly, Alex Bennett did some fine radio in his prime.  Yeah.  But he's an old fucking curmudgeon that walks these halls miserable.  He really is. 
[00:54:00]  All right, Dan.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Let's go to Matt in Michigan.  Matt.  How you doing, guys?  Oh, Michigan, Matt.  What's that?  Nothing.  Go ahead, sir.  I just wanted to say you guys should organize a boycott of Auschwitz.  I definitely think that'd be a good idea.  Hey, what do you got on the Anne Frank thing?  Because that's why I picked up your call.  Honestly, I went to the Anne Frank house, and after waiting two and a half hours in line,  at the end of the whole tour, they seriously have a gift shop and also a place where baristas brew coffee the entire time. 
[00:54:30]  Why do you get a little coffee after the Anne Frank thing?  Yeah, what's wrong with coffee?  It's not like it's a fucking, you know, fruit shake.  Yeah.  I don't know why that would be bad.  I'm sure.  That would be.  Actually, a hot dog stand would be bad if you can ask for the Anne Frank.  With sauerkraut.  No, you don't ask for it.  You just point at the picture quietly.  And the motherfuckers bring you a burger.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  You think someone has attempted that? 
[00:55:00]  Maybe some shock jock in that area.  A shack jack.  We're going to set up a hot dog stand.  Oh.  And so Anne Frank's.  All right, man.  Let me, let's go to Kobe in North Carolina.  Kobe.  Kobe?  Wow.  It's an honor.  Yeah.  Love your beef.  Kobe.  Tony.  Speck and Z-Tack.  Tony?  Yeah, Tony.  Oh, well, now I'm not honored.  Oh, fuck.  Tony, what's up? 
[00:55:30]  Who cares?  Hey, that dipshit that want to boycott BP, he wants him to go bankrupt to Whitwell?  I'm not on the hook for cleaning up the fucking mess.  Yeah, exactly.  Wouldn't that be great?  Yeah, don't give him any more money to clean up the mess.  What assholes?  Well, but Obama's saying that, you know, he's going to kick ass now.  Is he?  Yeah, he's taking names.  Kicking ass and taking names?  He's trying to find out who's ass to kick.  That's what Obama's doing now. 
[00:56:00]  Oh, he's researching?  You just realize that Obama can't do nothing.  None of these politicians could do nothing.  It's not even a fucking Democrat, Republican fucking thing.  Nobody.  They run their own companies the way they want to.  Yeah.  There's nothing Obama could do.  Nothing.  Not about BP.  The local politicians, they're sitting there like, ah.  They're telling their people, ah.  They're just sitting there waiting.  Just waiting for shit to wash up on the beach so they could clean it up.  Exactly. 
[00:56:30]  That's the best they could do.  I don't know.  Get your ass to the beach and fucking pick up some fucking tar balls.  They're trying to pass some kind of legislation to make them a little more liable than just their insurance has.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Really?  We all need oil to survive.  Guess what?  Obama's doing nothing.  He'll make it look good.  He's been down there, what, five or six times, right?  Yeah, yeah.  Talking to local people.  Now he's going down there too much.  Going to the local crab shacks and having some crab.  Why?  It's not got oil on it. 
[00:57:00]  Not yet.  Stop eating oily crab.  You're the president.  I bet he brings his own crab with him and just pulls out his pocket and does a little sneaky dip.  Oh, look, crab, folks.  Look, I'm eating the crab.  And they're like, it's got pocket lint on it.  You're eating a crab with pocket lint.  Comment.  When you just said, look, I'm eating some crab, I went right back to Jaws.  Hey, come on.  Go in the water.  Yeah.  Go in the water.  You go in the water, everybody else will go in the water.  Go for a swim.  It's probably a mayor down there like, hey, why don't you eat the crabs?  If you eat the crabs, everybody else will eat the crabs. 
[00:57:30]  I don't know why I eat the crabs.  With his anchor suit.  Yeah.  Stupid anchor suit.  Got a suit with little broken oil things on it.  Oil rigs.  Oil rigs.  Why don't you get in that water?  Couldn't think of what they were, so I called them oil things.  Oil thingies.  I'm sweet.  Everyone says so.  Let's go to Greg at D.C.  Greg.  Greg.  Yeah, boys, listen, I listen to you guys a lot, and sometimes I just, you know, it's  hard to agree with you, and on mornings like today, it's tough, because you're beating  this woman up, and all she's really trying to do is grieve for her ex, and I think that 
[00:58:00]  if maybe you guys went and met with her when she was at the board...  Your acting sucks a dick.  Oh, that was...  Ah, there he goes.  Your acting sucks a dick.  How is he even acting?  What did he say?  Who rules?  So far, Howard rules, and Alec Bennett rules.  Who are you going to say rules, Greg?  What were you saying?  I actually did not hear it.  That's horrible acting.  I said they'd go down and meet with her at the Borgata July 2nd.  Oh, a Borgata plug.  Oh, okay.  Meet with her. 
[00:58:30]  Is she going to be there?  Confession.  I did hear it, but I wanted to make sure everybody heard the plug, because I'll pass them a question  over it.  Yeah, I did.  That's my acting.  I heard them talking over me, and I was hoping that they would ask the question once again,  who rules?  Thank you, sir.  Who rules?  Yeah, who rules?  Chip rules.  Yay!  I fucking hate you, Greg.  This guy is great.  He's pretty good.  Thanks, Greg.  I fucking hate you.  I had to take this guy everywhere with me and something, you know?  And something.  Yeah.  Oh, all right.  Kevin in Connecticut, Scott, what happened to Gary Coleman?  Oh.  Kevin, you know, right? 
[00:59:00]  Yeah, Shannon's innocent.  Shannon Price is innocent.  Yeah, the investigators just found out that Gary opened up that little door that keeps  the ironing board inside the wall.  What was he in, a 1930s house?  What, did the bed that comes out of the wall fall to?  Yeah, when was the last time you saw one of those fucking doors?  An ironing board.  The last time I saw that, Moe opened it up and hit Larry on the head.  What the fuck are you talking about? 
[00:59:30]  He said roof.  Ah, yes.  It comes with a Murphy bed and a neon light that flashes out the window.  Kevin's doing radio from the past today for everybody.  Yes.  All right.  So, oh, really?  Let's go to Stryker in, Stryker, Wyoming.  Did you move on us?  No, I'm a trucker.  Okay.  You're the mother Stryker?  No, there's only one of me. 
[01:00:00]  What's up, Stryker?  Hey, I saw a headline this morning, as I was getting ready to leave online, that Americans  overwhelmingly support criminal charges against BP.  Oh, shit.  Yeah, your phone sucks today.  Yeah.  Paul says...  BP jammed it.  Paul says Americans overwhelmingly support criminal charges against BP.  Well, guess what?  That ain't happening.  That ain't happening.  Here's what BP does.  We file criminal charges. 
[01:00:30]  BP closes other stations, moves everything back to their home country and says, fuck you,  America, take care of it yourself, and we do nothing about it, because the UK is not  going to extradite anybody to this country.  It's not going to get that far.  The only thing they could really do something about is find some kind of negligence that was  done that killed those 11 guys.  Right.  As far as the oil spill itself goes, again, unless you find some kind of negligence, it's  a fucking machine. 
[01:01:00]  It's a machine, and it's amazing this doesn't happen more often with all the goddamn offshore  oil rigs that are out there.  What actually happened?  It was an explosion from what?  Do they know?  Yeah, build up a gas in the pipe.  It built up, exploded, and they're supposed to be able to vent that shit, and there's all  kinds of safeguards that were in place.  Because someone fucked up.  I mean, there was human error in there, but it's like, that shit happens.  It's terrible, but it fucking happens.  And then you're going to look to throw people in jail. 
[01:01:30]  What good is that going to do?  There's still a fucking pelican with a mouth full of crude.  Uncle Paul rules.  Yes, he does.  I like the Uncle Paul.  Thank you.  This guy wants to rant about the Gary Coleman wife situation.  Who's this in Jersey?  Matt.  Hey, Matt.  What's up, buddy?  How much, dude?  Dude, this bitch does not deserve to take a single breath on this earth.  I mean, there's strangers.  No, there's strangers every day that they see something bad happen, and they help right  away, and she sits there and watches her husband die. 
[01:02:00]  Yeah, watches someone that she supposedly was in love with.  Doesn't all that crap about you go out the window when you see your loved one bleeding  on the floor?  Yeah, you're supposed to come to the table, you know?  Dude, I've seen people, like, in neck braces and stuff, pull over and help people that  are injured or something crazy happens.  It's just, it's ridiculous.  I mean, I don't understand how she could just sit there and watch.  Let me ask you a question.  Let me ask you a question.  You're walking around the streets of your city, okay?  Old man gets hit by a bus. 
[01:02:30]  Do you suck his dick?  Do you suck his dick?  Do you suck his dick?  Give him one last pleasure before the fucking great beyond.  Do you give him mouth to mouth?  Do you give him mouth to mouth?  And I have.  In a good instance, I left the emergency room one day.  I was sitting in my car while my parents wanted to get me my drugs.  Some guy had a heart attack in the car next to me.  I pulled him out of the car and performed CPR on him.  My parents come running out thinking it's me on the ground.  And it's just like, it's natural.  I mean, it's...  Well, let me ask you this. 
[01:03:00]  Did the old man have bad breath?  No, but I had to take his dentures out first.  Ooh.  Fuck.  What'd you give the mouth to mouth ant on an old guy that got hit by a bus as you go  into your car?  That's a tough one.  That's a tough one.  I would absolutely, but I wouldn't be happy about it.  I'd have to, yeah.  I mean, I do want to add that part of the...  I want to add that part.  I wouldn't be happy about it.  I want a dental dam.  I mean, I would hope it would be a 17-year-old girl being hit by a bus.  Needs a vigorous chest massage. 
[01:03:30]  Right, but if it's an old man, fuck.  Ah, you just have to do it.  Yeah, I guess you have to, you know.  Oh, that would suck.  That's the whole thing.  It's like, do you want to do it?  No, but you're going to because you're human and you have a heart.  And the point I'm making, and then you go back to this Gary Coleman wife thing, and there's  Gary dying, and she can't even fucking try to stop the bleeding.  If she...  That's easy.  If her follow-through was consistent with what she did during that 911 call, then it's fine. 
[01:04:00]  Some people do fold and can't handle that shit, and freeze, and whatever.  But then to get on these talk shows and say how she would take her life if it would save  Gary's life, and how she loved him, and that she didn't show that at all.  Well, that's supposed to transcend the freezing up that people do during emergency situations.  She didn't overcome that, but she's saying she'd take her own life to save him?  Bullshit.  Balderdash.  As she's snapping pictures.  Shut up, you liar. 
[01:04:30]  You're a lying sack.  And if it was that bad to her, why didn't she run outside to a neighbor's house or grab  a car so to be like, you gotta help me, I can't handle it.  No, she's gotta wait until the blood really gets into his brain.  I don't know what her deal is, but she's going to do enough interviews where we're all  going to figure it out.  There's something just not right about her.  I'm sure now that she's talking a lot, people come out of the woodwork and start explaining  who this Shannon Price is, who she really is.  What their relationship was.  I'm sure people...  Or other people will just talk and go, you know, she's a lunatic. 
[01:05:00]  I remember when she was in seventh grade, she talked to her sock puppet all day.  Yeah, you're going to find out all kinds of shit about this broad.  Now she seems like she's a hypochondriac as well.  She's a me-me bird, that's for sure.  She's got that me-me bird in her.  I don't know.  If I was to ever hit a girl my entire life, I would hit her.  Very good.  She had that Munchausen syndrome by proxy thing, but only with Gary Coleman instead of a child. 
[01:05:30]  It's like the mother in...  The mother makes the kid sick on purpose.  Puts the fucking shit in her oatmeal.  He would hate when she would carry him in a little bassinet.  He'd say, look at my little...  Look at my baby.  Someone left him on the doorstep.  And he would say, I was a TV star.  And they would say, wait, this joke has no steam.  And he'd say, yes.  So ended it.  It's sad how some of these TV stars' lives end.  Didn't Dudley Moore was...  I think Dudley Moore was living with a fan in Jersey or something at the end of his life.  That's right.  Some weird fucking thing was going on with him. 
[01:06:00]  Everybody was...  Because they misunderstood something, they were all trying to dance in his foot.  It's club foot.  They thought it was a place.  The guy thought he was to invest in club foot.  Club foot.  No, no.  It's not a place.  You don't understand.  You can't dance in it.  You should point at it and laugh.  He wound up getting like some horrible disease.  Brain cancer?  That fucked him up.  Yeah.  It was some kind of brain disease.  Very rare.  Brain fucking disease. 
[01:06:30]  I think.  Yeah.  Club foot.  Yeah.  It's a new hot spot.  Everybody does the toe.  Everyone calling with their...  Everyone calling with their Coleman cooler jokes.  Please stop.  Oh my God.  Call a morning zoo.  They'll appreciate a joke like that.  Oh, I get it.  It was funny.  It wasn't even then.  Not even then.  It was kind of cute.  It was kind of cute.  Here's what it was.  Ah.  Yeah.  Good point.  Fascinating.  What about the hundredth time someone thought they were being clever with that one? 
[01:07:00]  It was as annoying as the second.  Times two through 100 were the same.  Time one was this.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That works.  One was like, okay, that's a little clever.  By two, you're like, all right.  Enough.  I want to hunt him down and kill him.  Hey, he's got a monogram.  Really?  Dan on Long Island.  Dan.  Yeah, how's it going?  What's up, Dan?  I recently heard that BP had over 780 violations on the ground drilling. 
[01:07:30]  Really?  Where Citco only had eight and Exxon Mobil only had one over the past year.  Think about that.  Maybe you're right.  Maybe they should...  If they were having violations, why was no one doing anything?  Imagine if your company had 780 violations.  You could pay people off, you know?  All right, well, then...  You could reach the right wheels and shit just gets thrown under the...  Plenty of grease now.  Ha, ha, ha, in the water.  That's where criminal charges should be filed in.  That ain't gonna happen.  You know what I mean?  If they find cover-ups...  I agree with that, but it ain't happening. 
[01:08:00]  Yeah.  They're too fucking powerful.  Big oil runs the world.  It ain't happening.  Nah, they ain't.  780 violations.  That's crazy.  You can't have one violation with your business.  And the next company only has 8?  Come on.  But what happens is when it's all brought into light like this, then they have to do something?  Look, they got Nixon to resign.  If they can get Nixon to resign, BP can be fucked.  We'll see.  Yeah, all those violations.  I will bet a lot of money that they're pretty much gonna skate.  They're gonna pay a lot of fines is what they're gonna do. 
[01:08:30]  They're gonna pay a lot of money out, but the company will survive.  And they'll put up some kind of a committee that has to have inspections on these things.  A fake committee.  It'll be a fake committee.  We're doing the right thing so this doesn't happen again.  We're making sure this does not happen again.  And then it happens again.  Let's go to Rocco in Jersey.  Rocco.  Rocco.  Yeah, I was gonna tell the Gary Coleman cooler joke, but you guys just shit on that.  Ted Sheckler rules, bro! 
[01:09:00]  He's a good boy.  I like the Ted Sheckler.  Love him, actually.  Yeah, Ted, what guy does is yell like he's got nothing else to say.  Oh, really?  Does he?  Nothing else to say?  Yeah, he's just called these stupid embryons.  You mispronounced the Munchhausen thing.  Travis is gonna correct you in Virginia Beach.  Travis?  Yeah?  Yes.  Hey, what's up, fellas?  It wasn't Munchhausen disease.  It was Munchkinhausen disease.  Oh, it's different.  I see you got it wrong. 
[01:09:30]  Munchkinhausen syndrome.  Bap, bap, bap, bap, bap.  What?  Who rules?  Munchkinhausen rules.  You're right.  Sheckler rules.  Oh, Sheckler.  These people don't have radio shows.  It did him already.  Ted doesn't have a show.  Yeah.  He should.  Yeah, and the radio, I don't think so.  Maybe it's just for himself, you know?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Ted, yeah, the cooler joke is still being Twittered.  Who, I just, I cannot understand that. 
[01:10:00]  Oh, wow.  You just did a search?  Was it, what?  How long ago?  Look at all of them.  The latest one was eight hours ago.  All right, so maybe it's finally fading away.  And then nine hours ago.  Yeah, I mean, it's not fading as frequently, but still, I mean, how long has it been?  Yeah, but eight hours ago?  It was in all the night.  No, no, no, no.  Don't put coffin.  Put cooler.  Oh, oh, cooler.  Right, right.  Let's see if that's been tweeted recently.  Ah.  About the same, right?  Yeah.  All right, so maybe it's fading out.  Goddamn, Colin's tweets again. 
[01:10:30]  I gotta say it.  Funny, right?  Yeah, what is he?  I am?  I am Colin Quinn.  Yeah.  His is good.  And Andy Levy is good, too.  Andy's a good guy to follow.  He's got some good tweets.  Andy.  He's obsessed with the news, though.  No.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's a bit obsessed with the news.  But he throws some funny shit on there.  He's a very funny guy.  Every few tweets, it's very entertaining.  Andy, you gotta turn off the news every once in a while.  Go outside and play.  That's like his job.  He needs to know everything that's going on. 
[01:11:00]  He's gotta go outside and play.  Tell him.  Have some fun.  Follow Andy Levy and say, did you go outside today?  I've been to the bar with those guys afterwards.  They know how to tear it up a little bit, that's for sure.  I was actually the first one to leave, which is odd.  They were in there longer than I was.  Where?  Going to the bar after the show with Greg and Andy.  I just came home.  I was with Essie Cup and Penn.  Yeah.  I just came home.  You don't do the after the show hangout thing? 
[01:11:30]  I do sets.  Yeah, you do.  You're the hardest working man in show business.  Well, I was at not a good set last night.  Woo, did I bomb in my sports coat.  How did that happen?  How does a Jimmy Norton bomb?  Well, he stands there in his sports coat and looks like a fucking cunt, fucking baseball  announcer instead of a comedian.  Oh, you didn't get to change into your funny Jimmy Norton clothes?  No, I always were.  Your suspenders and buttons?  You should have taken off your coat.  No, I never mind performing in a coat.  I'm just saying it wasn't.  The crowd was very weird last night and the guy at the door, the security guy, told me 
[01:12:00]  everyone was bombing.  Everyone was having rough sets.  What's wrong?  Is it just the crowd is fucked?  They weren't rude.  They weren't talkative or annoying.  They were just quiet.  And you get that sometimes.  You can't even be mad at them because they're not groaning.  They're not fucking with you.  Why are they there?  Just a weird mix.  Who knows what happened earlier?  It's just that mix, that energy.  A mongrel, malada.  Malada kind of audience. 
[01:12:30]  audience, both, I couldn't say, races or performers.  Well, God, that's so odd to me.  It's like, if you're not there, you're seeing entertaining comics.  I know that much.  I've seen Jimmy.  I know he's fucking funny.  Why are you there if you're not laughing or having a good time or just kind of sitting there?  There's certain lines you throw out where when they get nothing, you're like, uh-oh.  Wow, I really-  It's gonna be a long 20 minutes. 
[01:13:00]  That was like one that should have gotten them and it got nothing.  Then you just beat them up.  But they weren't even-  You beat them up sometimes.  Other times you throw out a couple of more.  And when they're getting-  Like, things that should be getting like an eight, eight and a half, or getting a two.  Wow.  It's just gonna be one of those nights.  You just work on your timing.  You're like, you know what?  I'll just fucking take it like a man.  Yeah.  You're just in class at that point. 
[01:13:30]  They're not doing anything to deserve being yelled at.  Yeah.  Other than just not enjoying me.  The cardboard Rupert Pupkin audience.  Is that what you have?  I would have preferred that because they looked happy.  At least they were smiling in their frozen cardboardness.  One of my favorite parts of King of Comedy is when he leans over and he kisses Liza and  he goes, there's something about you when you go away.  It just agrees with you.  And then he turns to the fake audience.  Right?  Am I right?  Am I right?  Am I right?  And he claps and looks at her like, oh, what an asshole. 
[01:14:00]  Oh.  But he's gotta go.  Yeah.  Take it easy, Jerry.  Liza, you're beautiful.  Good luck at the-  Somewhere in Vegas.  Good luck at the sands or something.  And he goes, I gotta catch a bus.  Yeah.  Me and my chick just watched that day the night.  It was fucking fantastic.  It's an amazing movie.  You can't see that movie enough.  It's one of those movies.  Just don't get sick of it.  It's great.  It really is a lovely, lovely movie.  All right.  Why don't we break?  Well, I want to know about this dumb iPhone.  Oh, my God.  We'll talk about that. 
[01:14:30]  Dumb iPhone?  Yeah.  Oh, you mean the one that's in front of me right now as opposed to the new one that's  coming out?  This is a dumb iPhone.  But in 16 days, I will have the greatest phone ever.  No, you won't because they'll release eight of them to the store like those fucking twats  at Apple always do.  Well, one's put aside for old Ant.  Is it?  Yes, it is.  How do you do that?  I have my contacts.  I've got my contacts.  Nuff said right there.  Nuff said.  I'll have it day one, minute one. 
[01:15:00]  How do you do that?  I meet people.  I want a contact.  Why don't you come down to the store with me?  Which one do you go to?  I'm not saying.  Oh.  I'm not going to say because I don't want to blow up the spot.  Sure, sure, sure.  But I'll let you know.  Yeah, come down.  I'm sure.  Be happy to see you.  Okay.  Yeah.  That's the only one I go to.  We'll talk about the iPhone next.  Stay there.  So let's talk iPhone.  iPhone. 
[01:15:30]  Wait, I don't like the fact that guy called up and said something bad about me.  Really?  Yeah, on the FU line.  What do you expect?  Some pay, Chip.  Thanks for laughs.  Thanks for the laughs.  Thanks for bringing some joy to my life.  I don't think you're going to hear that.  Tell you the truth, Chip.  What do we know about the iPhone there?  I think I should.  It's in front of me.  Not that.  Not the one they're talking about.  Oh, the new one.  I hear the fucking video on the iPhone is really, really good.  I hear that you can fucking do iMovie right from your iPhone. 
[01:16:00]  I hear you can shoot a video, edit a video, and put it right up on YouTube right through the phone.  Yes.  And that's why I probably will finally have to get a goddamn iPhone.  All that fun stuff and more.  Because that was the only reason I was holding out.  Because the BlackBerry's video was much better than the iPhone.  But now, fuck.  How about this?  You're on your iPad.  You get a movie from Netflix.  You watch it.  Then you pause it.  You can then go to your iPhone and finish watching the movie on the iPhone. 
[01:16:30]  Nice.  And the resolution of the screen is unbelievably better.  And right now, it's really good.  But it's going to be even better.  So why didn't they put this phone out six months ago?  Because they wanted people to want it more and wait.  They just keep sucking you in.  They want you to buy a phone, what, every six months?  And they did put it out.  Are they putting out two phones a year now?  They put it out early.  No?  No?  I don't think so.  No, one a year.  One a year.  Every June. 
[01:17:00]  One every June?  Yeah.  That's their pace?  Okay.  They put it out a couple of months ago.  Some drunk at a bar went.  And what they're saying is that was absolutely the iPhone that that guy left in the bar.  I was wrong about that.  It was absolutely wrong.  I was very wrong about that one.  Two cameras, one on the front, one on the back, which is very good because if you've ever  tried to take a picture of yourself without an app that is like a self-timer or something,  it's very difficult.  You have to turn the camera around, look, position your finger over the little icon that snaps 
[01:17:30]  the picture, and then try to do it.  Now you'll have the camera on this side so you can see and the camera on the other side,  which will allow videoconferencing on it also, that camera, so you'll be able to do a little  conferencing.  The other thing is, oh, the email is going to be like the text is.  Threaded.  Threaded. 
[01:18:00]  Threaded email.  Wow.  Where from one subject you see everybody instead of having to sort through your email like Gmail  is.  You can do it that way.  It's thinner by a couple of millimeters.  It's the thinnest smartphone out there.  So now we're going small again.  Yeah, yeah.  We went small, then we went big, now we're going back to small.  Well, they have the iPad.  Since they got the iPad now, now they could make it a little smaller.  Now they could go back to a little smaller.  A little thinner.  They made the battery life better. 
[01:18:30]  They got a better battery in there.  I'm trying to think of any of the other features I remember.  For an additional $4.99, you can get like the iMovie app.  Yes.  Which apparently runs just like it does on the Mac.  So you can edit.  IMovie, yeah.  Editing.  An additional $500?  Am I?  No, no, no.  Five bucks.  Am I a ghost?  I said that.  What?  I didn't hear either.  Same thing.  I know.  Yeah, the editing.  Yeah, but you could really do some.  That's what I said.  I said you could shoot video right off your phone. 
[01:19:00]  You could edit it right on your phone.  And then you could pop it right up to YouTube all from your phone.  Yeah.  That's how I started this whole thing.  I said that's why I think I want to get an iPhone now.  Because I've always been about the BlackBerry.  Because their video is much better.  But not anymore, it seems.  The cameras, too, are going to be higher megapixel camera.  Up to five.  Yeah.  It's going to be really a much better camera.  And then I was reading a lot of message boards and things about black people.  And then I went to the iPhone once. 
[01:19:30]  And I read those message boards.  Is that your two subjects every day?  Yeah, that's my subject.  Black people and iPhones.  I'm obsessed with both.  Yeah.  So I was reading message boards.  And you always get the people, though, that are like, oh, they're in so much trouble because the droid is out.  Or they're in so much trouble when this phone comes out.  But every phone that's coming out, every smartphone, is based on what Apple is doing with the iPhone.  Sorry.  No one's ahead of it.  You're right.  No one's ahead of it. 
[01:20:00]  No one's ahead of it.  They're always chasing it.  Whether they're coming up with apps, just the fact that it's called a fucking app, you'll never have the amount of apps.  And the developers that are making them for the iPhone, you don't have that many making them for the other phones.  So it's just always going to be that much better.  Everybody, they call the new phone that comes out from the competition as the iPhone killer.  iPhone killer.  So they're just trying to spend their time being the iPhone or being better than the iPhone when they should probably just focus on just being its own and do their own on its own. 
[01:20:30]  And just look at the lines outside the place when they launch these things.  Every year they launch a new iPhone and the lines are retarded.  Who comes up with the term iPhone killer, by the way?  Because that is dumb marketing.  Is it the company themselves?  No, it's just the fanboys.  The fanboys, the bloggers.  That's the first time I ever heard it was Steve.  This is the iPhone killer.  Well, the fanboys aren't doing the company any favor.  That was his Nokia with a stylus, I think.  Yes, a stylus. 
[01:21:00]  I use it to deflate my air valve every so often.  Did you guys see, I think Radio Shack put signs in their window for the new Sprint 4G Evo.  And it's like, 4G Evo line starts here.  And it was like launch day.  And then there was a whole bunch of pictures of the lines that were in front of these Radio Shack, which there was none.  So it was just an empty street, empty sidewalk with a sign.  Doesn't look good.  Doesn't look good.  I'm sure it's a great phone, but I mean, you know, it's not killing anything.  No, this is going to be another huge hit, I think, for Apple. 
[01:21:30]  I think when this is launched and people start using it, like you were saying, just the fact that you can edit video and quality HD video.  I don't know.  720 or something like that?  Yeah.  I mean, it's going to be really good quality video.  Oh, my God.  I'm losing my grip.  I can't.  It'll be like, I can't do it.  I can't.  I can't.  You know what?  The BlackBerry makes a great doorstop.  It really does.  BlackBerry's hanging in there. 
[01:22:00]  You want to prop a door open.  It'll just be like having a flip on your phone.  I know.  Yeah.  Trust me, I know.  That's when I read that, I was like, fuck.  I'm starting to shake.  I might have to do this.  BlackBerry guy is stubborn.  I ran to the BlackBerry people.  I'm like, when the fuck is your phone coming out?  They're like, oh, maybe in the fall.  I'm like, in the fall.  They fucking stink.  They put out that piece of shit storm.  It was fucking click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click.  You didn't like the clicky buttons?  Fuck BlackBerry.  They lost me forever with that piece of shit. 
[01:22:30]  That's your idea to the iPhone, you stubborn faggots?  Yeah.  Because they wouldn't just realize it.  Enough with the buttons.  You don't need fucking buttons anymore.  They're all trying to appease BlackBerry.  And wow, we have this and we have the button.  How about this?  Fuck buttons.  Touch screen.  Touch screen is going to be everything.  Touch screen is the way of the future.  And I got to tell you, that fucking iPad is great.  I completely apologize for bashing the shit out of it for as long as I did. 
[01:23:00]  Because when I get home, I pick that thing up and carry it around like a little electronic newspaper and magazine.  But could you just carry around your very light laptop?  You know, I was saying that.  I said I got the Mac Air.  If you're outside, it could sit on your lap nicely.  You know what, though?  It's just that much easier.  I'm just asking.  I don't know.  I haven't really worked the iPad.  Yeah, I was thinking the same thing, though.  I was like, I got a little Mac Air.  Why do I need this?  It's so much easier to just pick it up.  You leave it laying around on a table. 
[01:23:30]  You don't have to go like, all right, I got to get my power source.  I'll plug it in.  I'll log on.  I'll boot up Windows or boot up the Mac OS or whatever.  You just pick it up and carry it around like a book.  And then you hit the thing.  You go through your apps.  Boom.  You're fucking browsing.  Bam.  You drink your coffee.  Boom.  Now I'm like, Bob Kelly, you fucking douche, made me fucking try it out.  It's great, though.  It really is.  And then I was doing like some online banking yesterday, which I usually do on my iPhone because 
[01:24:00]  it's got an online banking app.  And I was doing it on my iPad at double the size.  I mean, the size of the iPad.  And the numbers are big, so you could be a retard doing your banking.  It's just this giant version of what I was using before.  And you could go really quick because the keyboard's a lot bigger.  You know, it's like making sure you don't make a mistake, putting the amount of a check  in there.  It's fantastic.  Oh, the lines for the Sprint at the Sprint store.  That's pretty funny.  Yeah, that wasn't very good. 
[01:24:30]  And watch, when this is released, I think June 24th, right, you're going to be seeing  a lot of people in front of Apple stores everywhere.  I don't think so.  No?  No.  You just think it's going to be like one guy?  More than one.  Me?  Five or six.  You know what?  I don't think you're going to see the length of lines that you have in the past.  I mean, I'm sure there will be some, because now the availability is in so many more places.  Yeah.  Like, you know, you can get an iPhone at Best Buy now.  So I'm pretty sure that while there will be lines, I don't think it's going to be like anything  that there was in the past.  I think you'll be annoyed at having to wait. 
[01:25:00]  That's what I, I don't think it's going to be those lines around the block like the original  launch of the iPhone.  Are you annoyed when it's something cool, though, that you're waiting for, like the new iPhone?  I hate waiting for anything.  I hate being online for stuff, because I know that other people are not going to do the transaction  as quickly as me.  They always have too many questions in front of you.  Yeah, yeah.  Dumb questions.  People are asking questions.  Questions they can answer themselves.  You don't want questions.  It's like, I want the phone, give it to me, and that's it. 
[01:25:30]  They just want human interaction or something.  It's like, shut up.  You know the answer to that question.  Why are you still asking questions?  Can this make a call?  There's lines behind you.  I'm just talking in general.  Can I text?  Just talking in general.  Dumb, stupid questions always in front of you as you're sitting there like, I want to  be out of this store now.  Nothing worse than the pharmacy counter, when you go to pick up a prescription or something.  Will this cause a rash?  What do I, well, but my insurance company said I could get the generic.  So, could you call my doctor, and while you're doing that, I'll stand here and ask you 80 
[01:26:00]  more rename questions.  And then you're standing behind and just, and then you just give your name when you're  finally like, can I help you?  Here's my name.  Give me that.  I'll swipe my card.  There, I'm done.  Thank you for my Valtrex.  Cheasing, of course.  Ron in Connecticut.  It's an AIDS cocktail.  Ron.  I take both.  Hey, guys.  Hey, Ron.  Good evening.  Good evening.  Yeah, Jimmy, this one was designed just for Jimmy.  I heard on the news, I think yesterday, that even Steve Jobs, when he premiered it, couldn't 
[01:26:30]  get a fucking signal.  They said that wasn't a phone issue, though.  I saw the video.  It wasn't a signal with a phone issue.  They were on the wireless network, and the network was fucked up.  It had nothing to do with the phone.  The network was fucked.  Yeah, well, that's what they say, but, you know.  No, it's not what they say.  They were running wireless.  They were running wireless.  It had nothing to do with the phone company, with AT&T, with running it on 3G or anything 
[01:27:00]  else.  It was the wireless network.  Like, when you're, sometimes you're at work, you go to go on your computer, to go online,  and you can't get it to a webpage.  That's what happened to them.  Yeah, but they were saying it was a phone, though, right, dude?  No!  Of course they would blame others.  They don't want to take the responsibility for that.  Yeah, but there's an icon.  They're very smart to do that.  It's on the home screen, which indicates that Wi-Fi is connected.  It's connected!  Well, that's what they would say.  Sir, comment?  That's what they would say.  Well, you know, I don't know. 
[01:27:30]  It's just, I guess they should just...  Just like talking.  Maybe.  I don't know.  A lot of people saying this, though.  I mean, a lot of people say, wow, Steve Jobs kind of had a little bit of a problem yesterday.  It was a blip.  But, I don't know, there's two clips from that.  Steve Jobs tries to go to the New York Times website.  Yeah, that was the one where it's...  You know, this is worth playing.  The second clip's really funny, because someone has a suggestion in the audience.  Did you hear about the suggestion in the audience?  Yes.  Yes.  I'm going to go to some websites.  I'm going to go to the New York Times today. 
[01:28:00]  Huh?  Today?  And let's just compare these websites.  Websites?  Horrible voice.  Yeah.  Oh, he's probably...  You know how mad he must be?  Oh, someone's dying.  Our networks in here are always unpredictable, so...  I have no idea what we're going to find.  Oh, he must be livid.  They are slow today.  Unpredictable like his liver.  Poor guy.  You know, you could help me out if you're on Wi-Fi, if you could just get off. 
[01:28:30]  I'd appreciate it.  We're having a little problem here.  I don't know what's wrong with our networks.  We're going to turn this thing around.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  They're laughing at him.  They'll all laugh at you.  All right.  We're going to switch over to some backups here. 
[01:29:00]  I have a feeling we might have the same problem.  This is the big launch...  Like, the big announcement.  Well, jeez.  I don't like this.  Do you know how fucking livid he must be?  He's panicking.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's go back to the primaries.  I'm afraid I have a problem, and I'm not going to be able to show you much here today.  I can show you some pictures in the camera roll.  Holy crap.  I can show you some pictures.  This is me. 
[01:29:30]  He's not good at improv, is he?  He can't really just go with it.  Here's our chief internet guy being executed in two hours.  Here's me jerking off in front of a schoolyard.  Here's a log I dropped this morning, and here's Anthony's gun.  Before I lost 200 pounds.  The only thing I don't understand about that is if you're demoing the iPhone on Wi-Fi, why  wouldn't you have your own private network?  Dedicated, private, just for one phone.  Why would he be connecting to the public Wi-Fi that's there?  Everyone else in there is connected to it and, like, fucking rolling. 
[01:30:00]  It doesn't make any sense to me.  They're rolling on it.  Is that really a picture from the new iPhone?  Yeah.  Holy shit, have they figured out the fucking camera?  Look how big that is.  That's full resolution.  No, come on.  That's the full-size iPhone 4 camera pick.  Oh, my God.  They've come a long way with the iPhone pick.  Get the fuck out of here.  Yeah.  It's amazing, the resolution this thing has.  That guy needs to fucking get that mole removed.  Yeah. 
[01:30:30]  And if we can punch it up, I'll let you see it.  No, you get nothing.  You're standing there like adults now.  Well, Steve tries again, and this is where the suggestion from the audience comes in.  It's pretty good.  Let me try one more time here.  Boy, I'm sorry, guys.  I don't know what's going on.  Oh, here. 
[01:31:00]  Scott, you got any suggestions?  Horizon.  We're actually on Wi-Fi here.  So, all right.  Well, we're going to hope that things get fixed before my next demo here.  He's not feeling any jokes.  He doesn't want any jokes.  You hear the laugh and the applause that got? 
[01:31:30]  Yeah.  Good.  Fuck AT&T.  That guy probably got removed from the venue.  And executed.  Yes.  What a bore Steve Jobs is, though.  He's horrible in front of the audience.  What an uninteresting guy.  Yeah.  If something goes wrong, he's horrible.  The guy's a computer genius, and I'm mad that he can't improv as his demo is going down  the toilet.  I am a faggot.  Down the shitter.  You better damn right be able to improv, though.  You never know when something's going to go wrong.  You can't just assume everything's going to work perfectly.  You've got to have a plan B.  You've got to have the backup plan.  That was a Wi-Fi issue with, not even with the phone. 
[01:32:00]  It was with the server that they had running over there.  So, eh.  You know.  I just, I'm really psyched for it.  I'm a fucking dickhead when it comes to these goddamn iPhones.  I have a stack of them now.  Fuck.  I'm just going to keep getting them.  You can use those as iPods.  Yeah.  Not that you would.  Yeah.  Take them in the range.  I make hats out of them.  I put them all in like a little, I put them all, I tape them together, and I put a brim  on them, and I wear iPhone heavy hats. 
[01:32:30]  They're very heavy.  Yeah.  Blue Heeler writes, Jesus fucking Christ, stop gushing over a five megapick camera when  the competition is already at eight.  He's right.  Five is good enough, though, is what you learned.  Five is good for a fucking phone.  Travis and I were talking about this just before in the office.  1.2 is not that great, but five is good enough.  I don't care.  Hold on.  Let me hear Dan's conversation with Travis.  I don't care about the, I mean, everybody takes pictures on their mobile device, but  no one's taking serious pictures with their phone. 
[01:33:00]  You still have a digital camera to take serious pictures.  So, a five megapixel camera on your phone is plenty good.  It's pretty fucking amazing.  If you want to take a great picture, you get out your real camera.  It's not like, oh, let me bust out my HTC and take a nice real picture.  How many megapixels do you need to take a good cock picture and send it off?  Really?  There's any nationality.  I don't need an eight megapixel photo of what you're having for breakfast.  Yeah. 
[01:33:30]  Here's my salad.  Egg whites.  Right.  Egg whites and two severed fingers at five megapixels.  The old five megaton is taking a five megapixel picture.  Poor big A.  I'm sorry.  A big A.  A big A.  This guy wants to talk about the iPhone killer, the Google phone.  Oh, the Google.  Nice job.  You see.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, sir.  Are you serious?  Yeah, serious.  I mean, how many times have you got to go over this? 
[01:34:00]  Now, let me see up front.  Look, I'll give Apple credit where it's due.  They're the first one to bring this iPhone and miniaturize all this technology and do the touch  screen, but are you guys all being like little girls acting about how they're forging ahead  and breaking new ground?  No, they're not.  Apple is now playing catch-up with every company.  Just like your guys back there said that all these other phones now have five and eight  megapixel phones.  Well, what does Apple do?  Well, now they're playing the catch-up game.  So, you know, for once, you guys need to stop shitting over these.  No, they improve their megapixels on their phone isn't playing catch-up. 
[01:34:30]  I don't think it's so much.  It's improving on something that's out there.  They are coming up with the new technology that other companies are taking.  New technology?  Yes.  And other cameras?  Right.  How about, no, not new cameras.  Fuck the camera.  I'm not talking about the camera.  They increased the megapixels on the camera.  Thank you for that.  It's not a new megapixel technology isn't brand new.  It wasn't invented by the Droid or Google guys, but touchscreen, the way touchscreen is  used on a phone, is absolutely been done by the iPhone better than anything else out 
[01:35:00]  there.  Right.  They invented it.  They've done it, but now everyone...  And apps.  Fucking apps.  Putting apps on your phone.  That is absolutely a fucking Apple design.  Right.  But where are they doing anything new?  Wow.  Right.  Pushing the megapixels.  Where are they doing anything new?  Pushing the megapixels.  You...  Ah!  Fuck you! 
[01:35:30]  No, you gotta answer this guy.  This guy's right, though.  You gotta answer the question.  Steve from Bateshaw rules!  This guy's right.  I'll just blurt out listeners and say how they rule.  But I mean, seriously, we're just adding more megapixels to the camera.  Frankis!  He's right, though.  Frankis!  You gotta answer this guy's tough questions, Anthony.  I did.  I believe it's the iPhone.  I believe it's the iPhone.  Yep.  Yeah.  There you go.  I believe it's another phone.  There you go.  All right.  Who cares about the megapixel wars?  That's the thing.  There's always gonna be something better now.  You know?  So, Apple's only gonna release...  Yeah, Apple's gonna release one phone a year, so they're not gonna have everything that, 
[01:36:00]  you know, they should have six months ago because they're releasing it now.  Yeah, if the Google phone was able to put out an image of Princess Leia saying that, Obi-Wan Kenobi,  can you help?  We need help.  That would be like, holy motherfucker, that's amazing.  That's new technology.  Just each one outdoing each other's megapixels is not developing something new, dummy.  Yeah, there's one iPhone and there's like a hundred Android phones, so they're all gonna 
[01:36:30]  be different and they're all gonna have something, you know, better than the other one.  Plus, iPhone...  I agree with that.  The iPhone changed the way people have their smartphones and use their smartphones in the  first place.  Exactly.  I mean, I'd like to see where the mobile market would be without the iPhone.  Without the iPhone right now, where we would fucking be.  Still flipping the flip phone thing open and...  Look at my cool slider phone.  Yeah.  Hey, the slider phones ruled.  I never understood.  I don't get it.  I remember you and your pebble.  I love my pebble. 
[01:37:00]  You worshipped your pebble.  I wanted to skip it across a lake.  We hated the pebble.  There wasn't a better phone out there at the time.  I'm sure there was the brick.  The sandstorm.  Why are people so passionate about their dumb phones?  They really are.  And what is the best phone out there?  It's your friend.  What is the best phone out there?  The iPhone!  Of course you're gonna say that.  What do the experts say?  The iPhone.  The only thing I'm hearing...  Are the experts saying the iPhone's the best phone out there?  It's really good.  And the only real viable competition that I keep hearing about, because that's how you 
[01:37:30]  can really measure the success of a phone, is if you keep hearing and hearing and hearing  about it.  And for the last, I guess, month or six weeks, all I'm hearing about is the HTC Incredible.  That's all I'm hearing about.  Really?  It's supposed to be a really good phone.  Is it Incredible?  Yeah, it's a very good phone.  And people that play with it will say it's a really good phone.  And coming from some people who have iPhones, and even from people who don't have iPhones,  that everybody agrees is so pretty cool.  I'm taking a look at the HTC today, right after the show.  Really?  I'm taking a look.  I can answer your question as to why people are so passionate about their phones. 
[01:38:00]  Yeah?  Because nobody wants to think they made a two-year mistake committing to a company or technology  because you're stuck with it.  It's 500 bucks.  People can't afford to run out and keep buying new phones.  Right.  That's true.  Everybody wants it to be the right decision.  Point.  It's also your constant companion.  Yeah.  It's your companion, your friend.  Your phone is your friend.  It's your link to everything in the world.  So you want it to be the best.  You don't want to think you have bad friends.  Lou in Jersey. 
[01:38:30]  Lou?  Hey, what's up, guys?  How you doing?  Lou?  What kind of phone do you have, Lou?  I just want to go.  The Apple is third in market share behind BlackBerry and Android.  Yeah, we understand market share, but that's different than quality.  BlackBerry has been adopted by the business world more so than the iPhone has.  So a lot of people that – let me talk – a lot of people that are working for large companies  have BlackBerrys and in their personal life have a fucking iPhone.  They don't like the BlackBerry, a lot of people, but they have to use it because of the workplace. 
[01:39:00]  It's like Windows.  You know, a lot of people don't like Windows, but they use it at work because their whole  company uses fucking Windows.  Yeah, I agree.  And the new iPhone actually does look pretty awesome, but I have both iPhone and Android.  They're both pretty awesome.  That fucking BlackBerry, they don't have a touchscreen.  That Storm is a piece of dog shit.  That click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click.  And that was the phone that made me make the big jump to iPhone exclusivity as well. 
[01:39:30]  They came out with one since the click, click, click, though.  Yeah, but it's a piece of shit, too.  I didn't buy it.  It's still clicking.  It's still clicking.  They made it a little better.  It's not as awkward to use, but it's still shit.  I can't stand it.  Why would it click at all?  Who the fuck thought clicking was a good idea?  Because I think they wanted to incorporate some part of the keyboard with it.  I know.  They're assholes.  There's no need.  There's no need.  There's no need.  There's no need.  No need to.  The iPhone, they figured it out, too, where you're using the touchscreen keyboard, and as you  touch the key, it expands under your finger so you know which key you're hitting. 
[01:40:00]  It's just a better design.  Well, there you go.  James has something very important to say right now.  Oh, shit.  Yeah, Georgia, James.  If you guys go on YouTube, there is a Google Map image of an Air Force base down below,  Jacksonville, Florida.  And the government's doing some kind of an assembly of something.  Because if you look at it, Anthony, I know you know how to read these maps. 
[01:40:30]  The airstrip is loaded with little white, looks like bands or something, all parked, and there's  probably 2,000 or better of them.  And I don't know what's going on.  And where exactly is this, sir?  Where exactly is this?  If you go to Google, if you go to YouTube and look up Air Force Base, Jacksonville Air Force  Base.  Right, right.  This video where this guy has taken a show, the imagery of that, all on the Air Force, 
[01:41:00]  the landing strip.  On the landing strip.  There's some kind of aircraft, right?  No, there's not aircraft.  It's in rows of five across, and I don't know how many down.  Yes.  In two separate columns.  They're white.  They look like vehicles, like UN bands.  White vehicles.  Vehicles, yeah.  All lined up, all up and down.  All right, what are they saying they are, sir? 
[01:41:30]  Let's cut to the chase.  Okay, I don't know.  I just think he's a paranoid lunatic.  It's probably a U-Haul fucking place, not an airstrip.  No, no.  No, I'm kidding, stupid.  That was a joke, James.  Jesus.  Okay.  No, no, no.  I think the military's getting ready to follow up some kind of evacuation or something.  I don't know where it is.  Why would you assume that, based on a YouTube video of maybe some squares on a runway? 
[01:42:00]  I'll tell you why, because he has white stuff in the corner of his mouth right now.  And he's wearing a tinfoil hat.  Yeah, and he's fucking smoking a lot.  Do you...  A tinfoil hat?  Does your office look like a beautiful mind?  All right.  Strings and circles on the fucking newspapers.  That was a joke, too, James.  Yeah, don't worry about it.  What I'm saying is the phones are a distraction.  All right.  Now, this is in Florida?  Yes.  Now, how about this?  How about there's an oil spill down there, 
[01:42:30]  and maybe it's some kind of deployment to clean up the oil?  Yeah, but the oil spill is in Louisiana, not Florida.  Yeah, but don't you know that the Gulf Stream is carrying the oil to the coast of Florida?  You have heard that, right?  Yeah.  So perhaps this is some kind of effort to clean up the beaches,  and they're just starting to deploy these things?  Wouldn't you think that makes a little more sense than an evacuation for some reason? 
[01:43:00]  Well, yeah, it does make sense,  but I'm not saying I don't know if it's an evacuation or what the procedure is.  It's just very suspicious.  It's not suspicious.  Why is it suspicious?  And if it's so suspicious and secretive, why is it on YouTube?  It is a little bit, though.  I know what he's saying.  Because the Google Maps imagery, the story you guys were doing last week  about Google going around door-to-door and taking pictures and stuff, 
[01:43:30]  they captured this.  All right, dude.  In your own words and with your mind, what do you think this is?  With a little more detail.  I don't know.  To be honest with you,  I think Obama is a master of distraction,  and there is something going on where,  you know how they push the health care issue.  You love these guys.  Yeah, the health care issue, sure, sure.  That fits in well with this conversation.  Did you know that they're also,  Anthony, this pertains to you and me both. 
[01:44:00]  Do you know that they also are trying to enact a UN small arms ban?  There are requirements behind that one.  Yes, I'm up to date on all of the arms bans that are pending.  What do you think it is, sir?  What do you think it is?  Yeah, what do you think it is?  Well, I think they're getting ready to do something  where it's going to be like Russia or China or something like that.  And the military is going to be enacted as the police.  So you think we're going to be under martial law? 
[01:44:30]  I do. I do.  When is this going to happen?  Before 1030? I've got to get home.  I know that martial law would make some really wicked traffic.  Yeah, they make good amps, though.  No, that's martial amps.  So when is this going to happen, you think?  I don't know when it's going to happen.  What's your hunch? What's your hunch? Sooner than later?  What does your psychiatrist think?  Yeah.  Well, let's just put it this way.  I have land out in the country, okay?  I have horses, so if the price of oil or gas go up 
[01:45:00]  and I can't afford to drive, I've got alternate transportation.  You've got horses.  That's good.  This guy's part of one.  Yeah, that's great.  I love getting a horse up to 60 miles an hour on the expressway.  Oh, literal Jim.  Yes, sir?  You'll be able to afford to drive.  So if you have to get somewhere,  why not have alternate source of transportation?  I could afford to drive.  Why not get a turtle? Just get that slower.  Well, if you want to have a turtle, Jim, you got that. 
[01:45:30]  This is coming from a very reliable source in the Federal Bureau of Investigation.  It says, tell him to shut up.  He's blowing up our plan to replace all B-2 bombers with cargo vans.  And that's coming right from the FBI.  So, sir, I think you're in trouble.  I think you better hop on those horses and head for the hills now  because, you know, you've let the cat out of the bag. 
[01:46:00]  Instead of bombers now, the vans are going to just drive through neighborhoods  and they're going to throw the bombs out the door and drive away.  Well, the other thing I'm telling you guys,  just keep your eye on it.  Right ahead.  There's some kind of distraction going on.  There's a distraction going on.  Yeah.  All right.  Maybe it was this call.  Yeah.  Well, thank you, sir.  Thank you for that info.  Okay.  All right.  If you have a chance, just go to YouTube and check out the video and look for yourself.  Well, we tried searching for it and your search terminology yielded no results. 
[01:46:30]  I'll tell you what, Anthony, I follow you on Twitter.  I'll send you the exact link through Twitter.  Oh, could you do that?  Yes.  Send me the exact link and make sure you put in information about, you know,  who you are and everything.  Okay.  Your name and where you are.  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Okay.  Later.  Holy shit.  I love people like that.  I'm fascinated by them.  He really thought something was going down.  Nothing's going down. 
[01:47:00]  Nothing's happening.  Relax.  A bunch of white vans.  Probably a giant carpeting company.  He thinks it's an airstrip.  Yeah.  It's a Siemens in Florida.  It's delivering shitty furniture.  Yes.  Oh, that's where I ordered my beverages from.  I get it.  Cum.  Yes.  I like that.  It's Lavoris, but it's cum.  It comes from a man named Lavoris.  He has a colored gentleman.  A gentleman of color. 
[01:47:30]  So, yeah, I don't think that that means anything.  No, no, no.  That's, uh...  But, wow, there's some paranoid people out there.  Just when people are telling me that I'm very paranoid in my thinking with the government  and everything, like, you listen to somebody like that and realize, wow, you can really  go over the edge.  Yeah, but you see how just people just take their sources from anywhere?  Like, this guy said he saw a YouTube video.  A YouTube video.  So, it's a government conspiracy.  They pull shit off of YouTube if it's a copyright infringement because there's two seconds of 
[01:48:00]  a song on it.  Right.  They will pull it off.  They're going to leave sensitive government satellite pictures on there that might disclose  some kind of secret.  It is gone.  It's gone?  It is gone.  Right, Danny?  I couldn't find it.  We could not find it.  I stand corrected.  He was absolutely right.  It's a distraction, and martial law is coming.  There's a bunch of white vans outside of Sherwin-Williams, and there's a photo of them, and I want 
[01:48:30]  to know what's happening.  I saw some brown vans driving, and they were stopping at almost every house, dropping off  packages.  I don't understand.  That's right.  They're going to take over the sky because they're called ups.  Yeah.  That's what it is.  Boo.  It was probably a fucking FedEx outlet.  Yeah.  Or whatever.  Or a warehouse.  Or just a FedEx hub, where they land their planes and trucks fucking get loaded up with 
[01:49:00]  shit.  Or maybe it's a white van factory.  Maybe they make white vans.  Put it this way.  It's anything but the initial steps to martial law.  Yeah, perhaps it's...  Maybe it's some rich guy molests children everywhere, so he needed a van for every city.  If you could get closer, you'd see that all those vans have little beds. 
[01:49:30]  Yes.  Little, uh...  Tiny little cartoon characters and mobiles inside.  Little mobiles that go tinkle, tinkle.  Yes.  I need 500 vans with cotton canning machines, and I need them immediately.  It is amazing, though, how far people can fall mentally.  Wow.  That is something.  Yeah, that guy was a stark raving lunatic.  He was cuckoo.  Yeah.  It's just paranoia to that level.  It's just, come on, dude, what are you thinking?  Paranoia is such an odd thing, because they honestly believe it. 
[01:50:00]  Like, that guy is telling everybody about these vans.  Yeah, and he's just kind of...  He's probably not even having emotion as he talks.  He's just kind of staring at one point in the room and talking.  He's really so bent on his point being right.  And let me tell you, they're out there.  So what was it?  No one knows.  Apparently a distraction.  It was a distraction that Obama's doing.  And there's going to be martial law in place.  The military's going to take over as police.  He had no reason for this, or no time frame. 
[01:50:30]  But he did say that when there's no fuel because of this,  he does have horses as alternate means of transportation.  I missed all that because I had to take a leak?  God damn it.  You know, it happens.  I love the crazies.  I know, the crazy people are the best.  He wasn't annoying crazy.  He was just a little...  He was frightening crazy.  Yeah.  And I cannot wait until he tweets me with that link  so I can not follow him and report him to the proper authorities.  People still want to talk about their phones.  They love their stupid phones. 
[01:51:00]  Are we done with the phones?  I'm pretty much done with the phone.  Someone wants to defend the droid.  Someone's talking about the HTC Evo.  What's the...  Evo.  What's up with the Evo over the Incredible?  Aside from Provider, I don't really know.  It's the Evo.  It's the first phone on the 4G network.  Who prints the provider.  But Sprint's the only person that has it, so...  Sprint.  I don't really have any experience with them,  so I'm not sure if they're...  When will Verizon be 4G ready?  I don't have to look it up.  I have no clue.  Next year. 
[01:51:30]  Because I'm wondering if they're going to have problems  when they get the iPhone  because all the data being used on their network  may be a problem.  Yeah, I've speculated this many times.  Many, many times.  With people.  Whoever will listen, I'll just sit down and talk and go,  do you think that if another provider had them,  there'd be the same problem?  Same problem.  Is 4G that much better than 3G?  It's one better.  I know it's one better.  It's one more better.  What is a G, by the way?  But this goes to four.  A generation, actually, of the cellular network. 
[01:52:00]  Talking about my 4G generation.  Come on, Jimmy, sing it.  Talking about my generation.  Oh, yeah.  Who, who, who, who, who, who.  Come on, Jimmy.  Who are you?  Who, who, who, who.  They're tolerable.  Jimmy doesn't like the who.  I don't hate them.  They're just annoying and very...  They're a good band, but I felt overrated.  Yeah. 
[01:52:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  We'll leave it at that.  Classic rock.  Yeah.  Good, good stuff.  But, you know, a little too loved by the fucking fruits at Rolling Stone and the critics.  You do hold a grudge.  Yes, I do.  Because of your Black Sabbath experience.  I fucking certainly do.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Yes.  Yes, sir.  The Who was pretty strong, though, man.  They were strong, but overrated.  They were a good band.  Very good band.  Overrated.  Yeah.  Why overrated?  Just, they were.  I mean, I think that they are...  I love their stuff.  Yeah, I like it. 
[01:53:00]  I mean, the Who, Who is tough to defend.  That one's tough to defend.  Who are you?  Oh, I get it.  The band name.  I liked a lot of stuff off of Quadrophenia.  That was a good album.  What's off that one?  Yeah.  If I heard them, I would...  They had some good songs.  Again, I would buy a Who's Maybe Greatest Hits album.  What about Love, Ray, and R. Mary?  Yes.  Oh, no, that one.  No!  No!  No, I like that. 
[01:53:30]  Yes.  Yes.  Oh, what about The Kids Are Alright on my hard drive?  I'm sure...  Is that Kids Are Alright?  I don't know that one.  I know I'm just right now.  Yeah, it's a little happy...  What about Won't Get Fooled Again?  What about Bob O'Reilly?  Wait.  Can you play some of these tracks?  Teenage Wasteland, you know.  That's a good song.  That's a classic.  Won't Get Fooled Again?  Yeah.  How's that one?  Won't Get Fooled Again. 
[01:54:00]  Terrible job of selling it.  You know.  It's Lady Gaga.  Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.  Oh, enough with this one.  You don't like this one?  I don't remember it.  It's okay.  I'm so sick of it.  But you know something?  In their heyday, when you see them live...  Keith Moon is fun to listen to.  Not really.  He's dead.  Not anymore, yeah.  He was a great drummer.  Yes, sir. 
[01:54:30]  I saw the Hoot Giants Stadium, and they start off with that goddamn, like, the overture to  Tommy, and they add, like, all the horns and everything.  It was so loud and fucking cool.  It was kind of cool.  It was.  It was great.  Something different.  Rock opera.  Enough with them.  They brought the whole Tommy concept on the road.  I don't remember that.  Exactly.  They're fucking sticks 15 years earlier.  It's Mr. Roboto.  You can't.  He's back to the hoot. 
[01:55:00]  You can't just throw Roboto at the hoot.  Giant robot.  Fucking Dennis Young on the backside.  No, I can't allow you to do that to the hoot.  Giant, giant, they were mad that he wanted to roll with a big cock on it.  Black Sabbath is like Air Supply.  But Sabbath never did that stuff.  It was just the guys on stage.  Well, neither did Air Supply.  They just played music on stage.  Yeah.  You're right.  They've been compared to Air Supply a lot.  They have, yeah.  A lot of times.  Music is similar.  This song is decent, and I like the music and drumming, but it's...  Yeah, this is the good shit. 
[01:55:30]  I wouldn't say this does much for me, though.  No?  It doesn't suck.  I think the hoot has been, like, it's obviously dated.  You know?  I still get into the hoot.  It's good shit.  What about Behind Blue Eyes?  Let's hear it.  A little ballad?  A little ballad that rocks a little bit?  And then it rocks in, kicks in and rocks later.  This bugs me. 
[01:56:00]  This is a little soft.  But it kicks in, Jimmy.  I like this song.  This is a very good song.  Who hasn't made out and felt up a girl to this song?  Right?  Oh.  Yeah.  And then when it gets rocking, you're punching her in the face.  Yeah.  No, that's when you just chug your hand down her pants.  After you're gently caressing her during this part of the song.  And then when it kicks in, you just go three fingers deep. 
[01:56:30]  And she goes, ow, stop it.  No?  Yeah.  Well, yeah.  Yeah, this is nice.  I mean, it's not as a love song, you know, I'll take She's Gone by Sabbath.  But I still like this.  Danny's still looking for the vans on the runways.  They're there somewhere, if you look close enough.  John Entwistle. 
[01:57:00]  The late John Entwistle.  Is he dead too?  Yeah.  He's dead.  Let's see.  Did it in.  You don't like this?  No.  Is he going to, is Pete Towns going to spin his arm in a circle?  With the windmill?  With his suit jacket.  The windmill?  What's wrong with the windmill?  Everything.  It's the English look with the jacket.  Exactly.  The fucking suit jacket.  What did the whoever do to you?  Rock out in a suit jacket.  My God.  They sold a few albums.  Dressed like my lawyer.  Apparently it's better than going up on stage to do your comedy in one. 
[01:57:30]  Oh, I should have been spinning my arms.  I was spinning my wheels.  I'm getting it.  I was a jukebox dud.  That's foreigner, but you know.  Right up with the who.  The audience was going, who are you?  Who, who, who, who?  Why are you here?  Boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo.  What else were they saying? 
[01:58:00]  Ah, shit.  I think the audience wants to hear Lady Gaga.  Lady Gaga.  Can you give us a little teeth going into break?  A little teeth?  Teeth was good.  I liked it.  We're trying to turn everybody on to teeth before regular radio grabs it.  Speechless is better, but teeth is very catchy.  Teeth has a fucking nice little beat to it.  Lady Gaga.  Teeth as we go to break.  Just a little bit.  A little taste.  No?  You got it, Travis.  Toofuses.  No, Danny's going to have to play it.  It's not in the sound.  I'll do Toofuses.  Is that how we did it yesterday?  Yeah, Sam played it yesterday.  Sounds like queer. 
[01:58:30]  Don't be scared.  I've done this before.  Show me your teeth.  Look at this.  Show me your teeth.  Sounds like a party in the east room.  Sounds like Lennon.  Everybody's talking about money.  Don't want your money.  That shit's ugly.  Just want your sex.  Want your sex.  This is a good one. 
[01:59:00]  Talk about my bad girl.  Bad girl.  Talk about me.  Show me your teeth.  Let me see.  Oh, boy.  Does Chip want to move.  Oh.  Oh.  Got no direction.  Chip can dance.  Yes.  I need direction.  My girlfriend was so, so bothered by Chip's dancing in the kitchen last night.  She got very uncomfortable.  Wouldn't.  Chip's dance is stupid.  That's a good one.  It's very good.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Chip's dance is great.  Hold on.  Do you need to dance to the song? 
[01:59:30]  I ain't dancing without music.  All right.  Hold on.  There's teat.  There's teat.  Chip wants to dance to Lady Gaga.  Back to the music.  Let's go, man.  You can hear her in your headphones.  This is Chip dancing.  Show me your teeth.  Open your mouth, boy.  Show me your teeth.  Show me your teeth.  Show me your teeth.  Show me your teeth.  Show me your teeth.  Show me your teeth.  Show me your teeth.  What the hell is he doing?  Got no salvation.  No salvation.  It's all I dance.  Yeah?  Your girlfriend was embarrassed by that?  She literally ran over and hugged Chip and said, you have to stop. 
[02:00:00]  Because she said the intense look on his face was so uncomfortable.  I love that.  Yeah.  It's that intense look.  Like, you're trying much too hard.  But he had on, like, the long-sleeved shirt and his collar was flipped up.  And she didn't like that.  Or the hop move, which he did.  Do the hop move again.  It's that hop over.  The one hop.  I didn't do the hop move this time.  Do it again.  I didn't do this.  Look at his face. 
[02:00:30]  He's a good dancing.  It's a different hop dance that she's not going to do it.  Yeah.  Well, that was videotaped.  I can't wait to see it.  That's how Chip does it.  Let's see if this old fucking laptop works today.  I'll fucking put it up right now.  The old fucking laptop.  Oh.  Can we go to break?  Yeah, we should.  We should do that.  I feel like shit today.  What's the matter?  What's the matter?  I don't feel good today.  You got boo-boo? 
[02:01:00]  I haven't been sick in about a year.  I was just bragging about that.  You should never brag about how long you've gone without being sick.  No.  Because I think that's the worst.  I think you already know you're going to be sick inside, and that's why you say that.  That's why the thought pops in your head?  I think so.  I think I'm good.  I haven't been sick in a long time.  My throat is on fire and upper respiratory.  You want something for that?  No, that's okay.  I don't need that.  Yeah, a little bit.  I don't need that.  His mind is too.  I don't need that.  Come.  It's just very dry in the throat and the upper chest.  Yeah? 
[02:01:30]  You feel hacky?  No.  Nothing's coming up, though.  No, nothing's coming up.  This might just be exhausted.  All right, we'll break and we'll continue.  Stay there.  Now you're talking.  What else is going on in the world today? 
[02:02:00]  MTV apologizing for all the cursing at their movie awards.  Whatever.  What?  Whatever.  They were fully aware of what was going on.  They apologizing.  They got people talking.  Are they really talking, though, or is it just kind of a...  They apologized before anyone really complained.  Yeah, no one cares as much.  No.  Paul and Oates cancel Phoenix concert in protest of immigration law. 
[02:02:30]  Uh-oh.  Looks like me and Ope are going to do a show.  What?  We're going to have to go down there and fill in.  Oh, just...  Yeah.  We'll hit the stage.  Dodging.  We'll start a fucking Hall and Oates cover band.  A Hall and Oates cover band.  When this fucking radio thing shits the bed.  Boo-doo-doo.  Well, what's that about?  Hall and Oates very upset, huh?  With the immigration law?  You know what?  Fuck these people that don't like this immigration law.  There's a lot of fine people in Phoenix that have nothing to do with the actual immigration law. 
[02:03:00]  Yeah.  Why are you making those people suffer?  They need their Hall and Oates.  They need their sour smile.  Yes.  And she's gone.  Here we go.  All right.  Now we're talking.  Arizona needs this.  They certainly do.  Why are they keeping this from the Arizonians?  When they start getting involved in this political bullshit, bands and musicians are...  They come off looking like idiots.  Nuff.  Go do your dumb show. 
[02:03:30]  Arizona's not going to hear this live.  This sucks.  Yeah.  Sucks for those people.  All alone with me.  It's...  If you're an illegal alien, you'll get thrown out of the country.  Wow.  What a harsh law.  Holy shit.  Holy dog shit.  That's the start of the split.  Yeah?  The country's going to split in two.  Civil war.  I don't know if it'll be a civil war.  Ah, Magnolia.  We're too busy to actually have a war about it.  I think it's just going to split. 
[02:04:00]  You think it'll just like...  Yeah, this is the start.  An amicable split instead of a little battle?  Yeah.  A lot of people are having a problem with this immigration law.  And Arizona isn't going to turn around and say, all right, you guys are right.  No, they're not apologetic about anything with this law.  And then some other people are going to agree with Arizona and do the same goddamn thing.  And it's going to...  Texas.  Eventually, it's going to be a split of the country.  I'm telling you.  This is the beginning right here.  I know what side I want to be on.  I think I'm going to have to move.  I got to be on the other side of the split.  I don't think New York's going to be part of the... 
[02:04:30]  Oh, hell no.  Part of the side I like.  Hell fucking no.  This lib fucking state.  Then what happens to the United States?  Then we have a lot of weird little countries like Russia did.  Yeah, that'd be cool.  Or the former Soviet Union.  With like all kinds of wacky different laws and stuff.  You think that's possible in America?  No.  Where the whole thing breaks down and splits up a little bit?  They'd bring the army in and just...  Oh, really?  And shut everybody up?  The second a state wants to secede and does anything more than just say it, they would  be squashed.  Amazingly, these fucking... 
[02:05:00]  What babies we are in the country.  They make a law that they feel is best for their citizens.  And all these fucking cocksucker states are being politically correct and not fuck Los  Angeles and fuck Hall and Oates.  Fuck you.  Don't go.  Arizona should strike back ruthlessly.  Cut the power for those fucking faggots in California.  Cut it.  Exactly.  Just cut the fucking thing off.  Fucking douchebags.  They're completely broke.  And they're not going to honor contracts with Arizona. 
[02:05:30]  Go fuck yourself.  Oh, Danny found the vans.  There's the vans.  Uh-oh.  Let me see.  All right.  That is so fake.  It's so fake.  What a dummy that guy was.  What is that?  That is so horribly fake.  Let's go to Jan in Tennessee.  Use a cloning tool?  Jan.  It's got to be true.  Hello.  Hello.  Hey, boys.  Yeah, what's up?  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Blue vans and buses on bases this weekend.  It was the Special Olympics on the Air Force bases this weekend, so they line them up on 
[02:06:00]  the flight line.  Cool.  All right.  Wait, wait, wait.  So, all those vans, there seems to be a lot of vans.  That's how they transport all the families and the athletes on base.  No, but they're like, if this is real, there are thousands.  That's a lot of vans.  Well, they get thousands of people.  Not that many.  Well, one per van?  Yeah.  What, for their big tongue? 
[02:06:30]  Big giant head for a big giant van.  Okay.  All right.  I'm not buying it.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  It's not like...  Oh, sorry.  I think it's just storage.  It's not like Google Maps is in real time, so, I mean...  Yeah, that could be from...  This could be a picture from six months a year ago.  If I go to my house, it still has a flat backyard with no pool.  Oh, there's no update on your house?  And the house next door, for me, is...  Wasn't even built yet.  All right.  Brian, North Long Island. 
[02:07:00]  Brian.  What's up, boys?  What's up?  Anthony, right before we went to break, you said you asked Opie if he was feeling hacky.  I was wondering if you were talking to Suit Jacket Jimmy.  Oh, no.  I wasn't talking to Suit Jacket Jimmy.  No, sir.  Oh, Suit Jacket Jimmy.  No, I don't feel hacky, sir.  See?  That's what my yard used to look like.  Isn't that funny?  Look, there's nothing back there.  I just felt like I was disturbing the quiet.  Oh, that looks kind of nice and serene without...  Yes.  All that nonsense in your backyard.  All the hijinks and shenanigans that are back there now. 
[02:07:30]  All those pleasures.  Pleasure.  Brian, why are you wondering if Ann knows about Opie's Blue Jacket comedy days, though?  I don't get it.  It was a little inside.  I think I remember back from the NUW days some tapes that might have been circulating about  some comedy that you might have been doing.  I was wondering if you had maybe forgotten about it completely, but it seems like you have.  What tapes?  What is that?  Punch it out, boys.  Love you, guys.  That's why I have no idea. 
[02:08:00]  I needed to know, but all right.  Let's say hi to James in Georgia.  James!  Hello, Opie.  I'm sorry you messed up the first round.  I think you were in the bathroom while I called earlier.  Do you hit the nail on the head with the immigration issue?  Is this the kook?  Yeah.  Oh, he's back?  Sure.  What do you got on the immigration there, James?  Okay, the immigration issue.  Now, if you guys are aware of the difference between the Arizona law and the federal law,  the Arizona law says if you're stopped in suspicion of committing a crime, you're asked for proof of identity. 
[02:08:30]  That's standard.  The federal government needs no reason whatsoever to pull you over.  They can just do it out of the blue, any reason whatsoever.  The federal government's not acting on that.  So, the state government says we've got a problem.  This guy is...  All right.  Just hang on.  Yeah.  All right.  A nut.  All right.  We get it.  You're crazy. 
[02:09:00]  Fucking hoarder.  He's probably a hoarder sitting amongst his garbage calling us.  This guy is a nut.  You're a metal patient.  A guy's got a gun problem for you.  Dom in Jersey.  We should fix this.  Dom talk.  Okay, guys.  Hi, sir.  Thanks for taking my call.  I appreciate it.  Wank, wank.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Thank you, sir.  Listen, the police took away my guns, Anthony.  I need your help.  What'd you do? 
[02:09:30]  Pointed it at them.  I didn't do anything.  That's the problem.  They took them away because they say it's a public safety issue.  They're worried about me doing harm to myself.  Now, why would they just pick you at random unless something happened?  Well, they didn't pick me at random.  All right.  What happened?  I did have some depression issues about a half a year ago.  Yeah.  I was out of work for like nine months, and I did check myself into a hospital.  Okay.  We did some treatment for that. 
[02:10:00]  So, you have a history of mental illness that required you to be hospitalized.  No, it didn't require me.  I went on my own.  Well, you went on your own, but you were hospitalized for a mental illness.  That is correct.  All right.  Did you fess up with that when you bought your guns?  Uh, no.  All right.  There's the problem.  There's...  Yeah.  I mean, I don't know if you're well, if you're not, if you're a lunatic, if you're stable,  but, you know...  Well, I don't see vans on Google. 
[02:10:30]  How'd they find out that you were lying or that you had done something?  Uh, well, my wife reported me missing at one point, and that's how they found out.  See, I'm starting to think...  And you need Anthony's help.  Yeah.  See, you gotta keep it between their little lines these days.  Some of the laws I completely don't agree with.  Some of these gun control laws they have.  Other ones I think are kind of all right.  I don't mind them.  I'm from the school of thought, though, where I kind of... 
[02:11:00]  I like, if you're an American citizen and you're of sound mind and body, there, you  could have a goddamn gun.  But this guy seems a little...  There might be a little issue with...  Were you suicidal?  At that time, yes, I was.  But I owned a gun at that time.  Well, then, perhaps you shouldn't have a gun if you're feeling a little suicidal.  James Norton, you want to field this one also?  You know, sir...  That's well in my past.  You know, sir...  Just have a thought.  It seems that the more you try to conceal... 
[02:11:30]  The more you actually reveal.  Thanks for the...  Dude, you got yourself a Jimspiration today.  No, I don't want a Jimspiration.  I want an Anthony Savings situation.  What am I supposed to do?  The inspirations.  He wants his fucking guns back.  I don't know a lawyer that could help you.  You guys have all kinds of lawyers that call into the show.  You're in Jersey, too.  The hell do I know?  I say take away your fucking Q-tips at this point.  Like, you're a danger to everybody. 
[02:12:00]  Exactly.  No stools or belts, either.  You should have to have your pants around your ankles like convicts.  Or loafers.  No shoelaces.  I don't know.  That sounds like an issue you've got to deal with, my friend.  Good luck to you.  You've got a vindictive wife, huh?  Yeah, a little bit.  Yeah.  Why was she concerned?  She's not anymore.  She's fine with it.  She's on my side now.  Well, you just want your guns back so you can probably shoot her.  You got my guns taken away, dummy.  No, I just want them back, you know? 
[02:12:30]  Hey, listen.  I feel like Second Amendment all the way, man.  Well, I know.  There are some tough rules, especially in Jersey.  So the mental illness one, that's a toughie.  Well, good luck to you.  Hope you can figure something out.  Thanks, boys.  I appreciate it.  All right.  Good luck to you there, buddy.  Have a good day, all right?  Just be safe, sir.  Yeah, absolutely.  Jeremy in Baltimore.  Hey, good morning, boys.  Hey.  So, long-time shooter.  Started with a .22, moved up to a 9mm, now have a .40.  But, Ant, what the hell's wrong with you with that damn .50, Cal? 
[02:13:00]  You were putting pictures on Twitter.  I have my YouTube account.  I have a video up on there, too.  It's O-P-A-N-T-X-M.  That's my YouTube.  Opant XM.  Opant XM.  And you can check out the video.  It's up there.  I got a couple of videos up there of shooting the .50 Cal.  But it's not...  It's fun.  It's a fun thing to do.  So, how many states can you even buy those things in? 
[02:13:30]  49.  Pretty sure.  Man.  I think California's the stick in the mud.  When are you going to have a listener day where we could all come by and squeeze off a few?  I had some listeners next to me.  They went to the right of me, and they actually had one.  But, yeah, you can see on the video the shock wave that goes through the Gatorade bottle from one table over.  It moves.  That's just the shock wave. 
[02:14:00]  I know it really doesn't look all that impressive, because it's just like some ripples in a Gatorade bottle.  The bottle moves.  Dude, when I was squeezing some rounds off, my drink fell off the table.  Yeah, you can't have anything on the table with you, or it just flies off.  Why do they have picnic tables set up?  Just in case you want to have a little picnic.  A little picnic in between shooting off some rounds.  Those are the shooting stations that are down there.  They do.  They're very uncomfortable.  They have to cut out the front of the table right there so a fat person can sit in that area. 
[02:14:30]  Yeah, it's for the chunky.  I love how you describe it.  I think one of your comments was, every time you squeeze one off, it feels like you have the flu for five seconds.  Yeah, it feels like you have the flu for five seconds.  You're dazed.  You feel all stuffy in your head.  You have like a, almost like you were punched in the nose feeling.  It's the most interesting gun I've ever fired is the Barrett M107 .50 caliber.  I hope to own one.  I feel like that when I squeeze off rounds on my .40.  And I liked it so much, I went to Coliseum Guns yesterday and bought a hundred rounds more. 
[02:15:00]  What do the rounds cost?  Four to five dollars.  Anywhere between four and five dollars per bullet.  It's an insane shell.  It's a lot of fun, though.  People are like, yeah, that's crazy.  You're insane.  It's not for home defense, that's for sure.  It's not for anything but taking to the range and seeing how accurate you can hit a target at very long distances.  And it's just a lot of fun to shoot. 
[02:15:30]  I kind of equate it to fireworks.  When you're setting off fireworks, especially as a kid, didn't you want to be the guy setting them off?  Lighting the fuse and running away and boom, you get the big explosion and shit like that.  That's what it feels like.  That's kind of what you're doing.  And you're trying to hit a target at the same time.  So it's just a lot of fun.  There are many mailboxes in New Jersey that are no longer there because of some M80s.  So I can definitely relate.  Let's see.  I don't condone that, sir.  Put it down.  Place on ground. 
[02:16:00]  Light fuse.  Get away.  That's what I like.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  God bless you.  All right.  There we go.  Gun talk.  A lot of gun people on the lines right now.  Yes.  I think it was 12 years ago today that Heston became the NRA guy.  Damn you.  Became the president of the NRA.  Yes.  From my cold, dead hand.  That's what he...  That was his thing.  That was 12 years ago when he said, from my cold, dead hands?  Uh, I think he was already the president and then made that famous fucking quote there. 
[02:16:30]  Yes.  And then he, uh, he got the Alzheimer's.  Yeah.  From my cold, dead asshole.  From my cold, dead foot.  I think he was forgetful at the end.  Yes.  Just a tad.  Poor old fella.  He's got the fucking barrel of the rifle against his shoulder.  He's pointing the stock at people.  Chuck, put it down.  Put it down, Chuck.  From my cold, dead freezer.  He didn't know anymore. 
[02:17:00]  He had no clue.  Everything was that when he'd go to eat.  From my cold, dead cabinet.  Pulls out some chips.  Eats them.  What's that?  No chip.  Why do I keep saying chip?  I've been doing some impersonations, too.  Have you?  Sure.  Well, let me hear one.  Who do you like?  Oh, Jim Carrey's a good one.  All right, dude.  Jim Carrey.  Alrighty, then.  I was doing the whole thing where I was catching bullets, too.  It's uncanny.  Were you?  Yeah. 
[02:17:30]  That means not can.  Yeah.  Yeah, it does.  Yeah, it does.  Jesus Christ.  Yes.  Dang.  Yeah.  Wow, we do have a little kid with a 50-cow.  Oh, Uncle Paul.  He had nothing funnier than watching little children shooting guns.  I don't think he actually shot the 50-cow.  You know something?  You'd be surprised at what they let these people do. 
[02:18:00]  Then this would be a video instead of a picture.  That's true.  I mean, come on.  If you've got a little nugget fucking shooting a 50-cow, you need the video, not a dumb still  shot of it.  Exactly.  They have kids shooting machine guns, which is really funny.  Really?  Yeah.  There's some states where you could just fire machine guns.  It's better than amazing.  It's amazing.  To the goddamn ballpark.  50-caliber cannon and nine-year-old boy.  So this is a kid shooting.  Okay.  Oh, the foot rotator.  They're loading it up for him. 
[02:18:30]  That's someone next to him.  I want you to put this real solidly in your shoulder.  Oh, that's good.  Pull back on there.  Take a picture of the time we fired the gun.  There's a gun.  Yes.  Can you see through the scope?  Oh, it's creepy.  Grandfatherly guy.  Yeah.  Oh, sorry.  Look at those big ear things.  They're picking it in his head.  Poor little kid.  He's a small nine-year-old, too. 
[02:19:00]  Oh, he's trying to get the shit kicked out of him.  All right.  He's lining up the shot.  He's looking through the scope.  Oh!  Oh!  Right on his ass!  Oh, it knocked him flat on his ass!  Hold on!  Are you okay?  Are you okay?  Is that his grandfather, probably?  His uncle.  Is that fun?  Yeah. 
[02:19:30]  Did he kick his ass?  Did he kick his ass?  Yeah.  I told you he kicks!  He has gums like Gary Coleman's wife.  He fell flat on his ass.  God damn.  Guns and children are adorable.  Hilarious.  Speaking of children, do you think that kid in Philly was drinking that beer?  Or was there something else in that beer bottle?  That's another story today, Big Stone?  Resist.  Look, it's a woman in a wheelchair shooting a MP40 machine gun. 
[02:20:00]  I hope the brakes are on.  Actually, I hope they're off.  You old hag!  That would be the bit.  Don't put the brakes on.  She's so old.  She's got to be 90.  Is that fun?  I said, if he's going to draw me, first again, I'm going to shoot him in the toodles.  Oh, she's going to shoot him in the toodles.  What are toodles?  I don't know.  But shoot at you, bitch.  Come on, you old battle axe.  Well, she didn't shoot the gun.  No.  Yeah, why don't we get her actually shooting the gun? 
[02:20:30]  Oh, at the beginning?  Oh, there it is.  All right.  Look at old mop marker.  There's grandma in a wheelchair.  Yeah.  She sure can't.  She's hitting all around the target.  That's probably the way she addresses the toilet as well.  She pisses on the floor the way she shoots that gun.  Fucking old lady.  Ah, shit.  She remembers cruising around with Bonnie and Clyde, the old bat.  And ready to shoot one of these?  Yeah, she's...  Oh, all right. 
[02:21:00]  There's a 10-year-old shooting a .50 caliber.  This is rock music.  Let's go to Robbie in Chicago.  You've got to hold his back like that.  He's got his hands on the little boy's shoulders, doesn't he?  You've got to hold his shoulders so he don't fall.  Or flinch.  Yes, we don't tell.  Oh, brother.  Robbie's got something on this.  Robbie.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey, man.  Hey, so, yeah, Penn and Teller had an episode of Bullshit where they had video game violence  and they brought this, like, 12-year-old in to shoot a, I believe it was a handgun or something 
[02:21:30]  at a shooting range and he started bawling, crying, and his mom's arms right after it.  So, what were they trying to prove?  They're trying to prove that the video game violence had, like, no effect on kids actually  wanting to go out and kill people.  Oh, right.  So, you know, they're playing the games and shooting everything and then you take the  kid out to a real range with a gun and he freaks the fuck out.  Yeah.  And he runs to mommy crying.  Yeah.  Freaks the fuck out.  It's hilarious.  That's a good bit by Penn and Teller. 
[02:22:00]  Absolutely.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Thanks, guys.  Well, we got a biracial girl and a bit of a stink.  She's pissed off.  Biracial?  Biracial, yeah.  What race?  Asian and Russian?  Yep.  That's exactly it.  Very good.  All right.  Thank you for coming.  Bell and Drake still can't believe she's here at a news conference with the NAACP fighting  to get her 8-year-old daughter back into honors classes all because of hair moisturizer. 
[02:22:30]  I couldn't comprehend it.  You know, I was really just trying to make sense of it and that took a while.  Bell and says late last month, the teacher pulled her daughter out of class at Thurgood  Marshall Elementary and into the hallway.  My daughter reports that she kept just saying she was afraid and it's your hair and that  she could go back in to get her work and then go to the other class for the rest of the  day.  She says the school never contacted her about it, but instead permanently removed the girl 
[02:23:00]  from her honors classes to a regular classroom.  This is about the conduct of an adult and that would be the teacher and the ratification  of that conduct by the principal.  Ratification.  What happened?  I don't get it.  A daughter was pulled out of class because of her hair product.  She had greasy, smelly hair and it was actually not even a product.  It was olive oil.  Olive oil?  Yeah, that they put on the kid's hair.  Why?  And I don't know.  Olive oil doesn't stink.  But if you don't wash it out, I guess it would wind up stinking after a while. 
[02:23:30]  I guess you're right.  And it would just kind of plug up everything.  She a dirty kid?  Regardless, she was a smelly girl, I guess.  And she had that grease in her hair and people didn't like it.  The teacher didn't like it.  Said it was a class distraction and made her leave the class.  Well, why can't she come back if she washes it out?  I guess she won't wash it out.  Fuck her then.  It's the whole family jumping on the bandwagon.  A lot of people put olive oil in their hair?  Well, I think it's more of a thing that certain people do. 
[02:24:00]  See, I read this story on a certain website that I peruse every day so often.  Yeah.  What's the olive oil in the hair shit?  I don't know.  Maybe somebody can enlighten us.  Sam, do you know about this?  Of course he does.  Why does Sam know about this?  Oh, that's right.  Do you ever have olive oil in your hair, Sam?  Yeah, I actually have had olive oil in my hair.  It helps the scalp.  What?  Yeah.  But the story...  What's wrong with your scalp?  You're a kid.  It's covering retardation. 
[02:24:30]  It's wrapped around nothing.  What's wrong with your scalp, young Sam?  When your scalp dries out...  You put olive oil in your hair?  You put olive oil in where the roots are.  Olive oil.  But the way that was reported was that she had...  I moisturize cut hair with my jizz gum.  It has to go right to cumming in her hair.  Of course.  I can't cum in a pusky.  It's much too small. 
[02:25:00]  I fucks her in the ass and cum's in her hair.  Ah, cuck, cuck, cuck, cuck.  Ah, cuck, cuck, cuck.  It was saying...  Jizz gum.  Now, if you don't rinse out the olive oil, does it stink?  Some people say it within a day.  Wow.  It turns.  Yeah, I mean, you kind of got to rinse it out.  The story reported, though, that the teacher was allergic.  The teacher thought that she was allergic to whatever the kid had in her hair.  Why won't the kid wash it out?  I don't know.  I mean, I don't know why the kid... 
[02:25:30]  Why do I got to wash it out, motherfucker?  But if her hair is black hair, she probably doesn't wash it every day.  You mean black person hair?  Black person hair.  What are you saying?  Black people don't wash every day?  Stop it.  Black people generally can't wash their hair every day.  Why?  You are making a sweeping generalization that I find offensive...  I'm sorry.  ...and racist.  ...that many times black women have to treat their hair...  What?  ...you know, so it's not so nappy.  When they do that...  What a good day! 
[02:26:00]  People have been thrown off the air for words like that.  Settle down, Sam.  Is the word coarse what word?  Good luck to you, man.  Coarse.  Snappy is one of the words you can't use on the radio ever.  Of course not.  Okay.  Say hi to Mr. Iman.  Your hair is good napsky!  A-ca-ca-ca-ca-ca.  A-ca-ca-ca.  Ski-headed hoes.  Go-dee-doe-doe-doe-doe.  But if coarse hair goes through straightening treatments or moisturizing treatments, when  you wash it, it breaks.  So you can't wash it every day because it weakens the hair.  Oh, oh, so that treatment to straighten that hair out weakens it. 
[02:26:30]  Right.  You can wash it maybe, like, I don't know, once a week.  Ugh.  Because it breaks.  Ah.  Who the fuck wants broken hair?  Well, that's why you can't wash it.  Oh, just let it stay curly.  That's what an argument in a large sect of the population says.  Just leave hair natural.  Right.  The natural.  It was called a natural years ago, you know?  The big afro was called a natural. 
[02:27:00]  I prefer natural hair.  And when I went to Disneyland as a child, I had a big afro.  And there was a black woman at the, um, she was controlling the ride.  And as I went in with my father, who was just a screaming racist.  Ah, he, um, uh, the woman that was running the ride said,  Oh, child, your natural's bigger than mine.  To which my father took a belt and a scissor to me the second we got home.  Wait, a belt? 
[02:27:30]  Got that guy.  Yeah.  First, I had to be beaten for being like a colored person.  And having to, uh, have him embarrassed, carting me around.  And then the hair had to come off.  Now, is that part true?  The belt part?  Uh, yeah.  Yeah.  Why did you have to get beat?  Because the black woman said that I had a natural that was bigger than hers.  Blame your mom.  And why would I?  Blame your mom.  Mom had nothing to do with it.  Because this is out in California.  So what?  He is, he thought you should have just kept your hair nice and, uh, my Atlanta.  Yeah, I should have had my hair like, you know.  Thank you.  Like I should have put some olive oil in it or something, I guess. 
[02:28:00]  It needed a treatment.  See, yeah, I think he was very upset that my hair was like that.  But meanwhile, it's his fault.  Because you know something?  Years ago, the Moors invaded Sicily.  Right.  And, uh, boy, if I would have told my father that speech.  Imagine that?  Yeah, I know.  So, uh, Dad.  Your great-great-great-great-grandmother was a nigger.  That's right.  Oh!  And I would have been killed.  What would have happened if you told my story and you looked over and he was just sitting 
[02:28:30]  there with a big tent in the front of his pants?  Oh, I would have been done with.  Holy shit, would I have been done with.  Did you fear your dad all the way to the end?  Uh, let me see.  Fear?  When did you finally go, okay, I could finally take him and I'm not scared of him anymore?  Nah, I was never able to, I don't think.  No?  Yeah, yeah.  He was pretty intimidating.  A pretty intimidating guy.  But not, not like I was always worried.  It wasn't, it wasn't that he would just randomly beat me or anything like that. 
[02:29:00]  I would always have to have done something.  Except for, you know, having a black person's hair.  That, you know, could have let it slide.  And then I didn't appreciate being hit after I stole the quarters from his girlfriend so  I could buy ice cream sandwiches because I was starving.  Because they wouldn't feed me because they were broke.  And then he got beat up for stealing the change.  And then I got smacked around for stealing the change because he thought I bought Estee's  Model Rockets with it when actually I bought ice cream sandwiches from Thrifty Drug Discount 
[02:29:30]  Store.  How are they?  Delicious.  I ran out of Thrifty's.  I had the ice cream sandwiches and they were all cold.  And I followed the train tracks down by the riverbed and I sat there and ate every single  one of them.  I think there were eight in the box.  Yeah.  And they were so good and I was all full.  And then I knew I was in trouble for the quarters.  What a milky shit you must have taken.  Oh, it was great.  But I was a kid.  You could eat fucking shit like that when you're a kid.  You still take a lactose dump. 
[02:30:00]  A ton of ice cream when you're a kid.  Don't matter.  It wasn't that bad.  So you got home and got yelled at?  And then I got home and my father was like, come here.  We've got to talk to you.  I'm like, oh no.  Oh no.  And he goes, what did you do with Corey's quarters?  I'm like, oh, I didn't take them.  Of course, I tried lying right away because I know what's coming anyway.  I might as well give it a shot.  Or I would have gotten hit for lying.  Or the quarters or lying or both.  And then I said, I was hungry and I bought ice cream sandwiches with him. 
[02:30:30]  And I think his anger was, I think, even more directed towards himself for not having taken care of his kid and given him something to eat.  That's why I had the ice cream sandwiches.  It's not nutritious.  So then he backhanded me in the face.  Bam!  I was like, oh, fuck.  That hurt.  And yeah.  Then I got one more front hand to the other side.  You don't fucking steal. 
[02:31:00]  You don't fucking steal.  All I'm thinking is, well, fucking feed your kids, goddammit.  Did you point your finger and say, well, technically, had you done your duty and been responsible, I wouldn't have needed you.  Oh my god.  But since you chose to buy drink, I was hungry.  After technic...  Technic...  I wouldn't have gotten technically out before the backhand would have happened yet again.  Technic...  See...  Technic...  BAM!  No.  See...  Dad, remember you had that tall boy Budweiser and you're sitting with Chato Reyes drinking? 
[02:31:30]  Perhaps that could have been better spent on food products for me and I wouldn't have to steal quarters for ice cream sandwiches.  He's choking me!  He's choking me!  Oh my god.  No, it just would have been a...  It would have been a bad scene.  He wouldn't have listened to your logic?  He didn't take confrontation well.  Especially from his subordinates.  You know.  Was he a big guy? 
[02:32:00]  Hard for me to judge right now.  To think about it.  How tall?  He wasn't like a big...  He was...  He was...  He was...  Six something.  Oh, was he?  Yeah, but he wasn't a big guy.  He had like big arms and stuff, I thought anyway.  But he wasn't like a big guy.  He was pretty average for a six foot...  One, six two, something like that.  But, uh...  It was just like that whole thing where you're kind of walking on eggshells every so often. 
[02:32:30]  You know?  And then there was the nice part where it was, I think, from like maybe nine in the morning  till probably noon-ish.  That was it?  You had three hours?  Of sobriety.  And you're like kind of, oh, okay, this is kind of cool.  And meanwhile, he was miserable because he's just like hungover.  And then afternoon, you got like a couple of...  Maybe an hour of just starting a buzz.  The first few years are good.  That was like fun dad.  And then after that, it was just a nightmare of drunkenness. 
[02:33:00]  Where you're just like, oh, no.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, he's...  He gets angry.  And him and Corey would just drink and drink and drink and then yell at each other.  Corey was his chick.  Yeah.  Corey was his girlfriend and then his wife after many years.  But then they would just constantly...  And as a kid, you're sitting there going, this happens every night.  They're arguing over nothing.  It's exhausting.  Just nothing.  Did you ever just tell them to shut the fuck up? 
[02:33:30]  No, I was...  I had a stomach ache.  Oh.  I couldn't talk because my tummy hurt very much.  You got my lanta.  You want some now?  I wish I would have had that.  Is it bringing back memories?  This guy wants to talk about your nappy-headed hair there.  Oh.  It's coarse.  Reggie in Boston.  It's coarse.  Exactly.  Hi, brother Anthony, my nigga.  Yo, what's up?  What's up, Reggie?  How's Dorchester today?  I'm so glad you came to terms with your blackness. 
[02:34:00]  Yeah.  I couldn't be happier.  I've come to terms with my blackness, my brother.  Hi, my nigga.  Yeah.  You know, I'm starting to listen to what Reverend Al says.  Yeah, I appreciate it.  That big, beautiful fro at Disney World.  They must have loved it.  Black Power, my friend.  You know it, baby.  Fuck Whitey.  Fuck Whitey.  Fuck that motherfucker.  I'm so sad Dennis Hopper died, man.  He was a good one. 
[02:34:30]  Best seen in a movie ever.  I was watching a Twilight Zone with him in it from like 1960.  What was that?  66 or some shit.  He was a fucking kid.  I think it was earlier than that.  He played like a Nazi.  Oh, really?  It was fun.  One of my favorite roles.  All right.  Punch it out, boys.  Thank you, my nigga.  Yo, yeah.  Wow.  I'm feeling you.  I'm feeling you.  Wow.  So we got part two of the shampoo story.  Some people say it wasn't olive oil.  It was some kind of weird shampoo.  Yeah, the news story said it was like a hair moisturizing product. 
[02:35:00]  Well, I get my information from N-mania.  I figured when they said it was dirty and smelly, I figured when they said it was olive oil.  Yeah.  Look at Dennis Hopper as a Nazi.  That's the one.  That's great.  He really looks the part, doesn't he?  He looks like a young Brando there.  Yeah.  Sure does.  Yeah, that was weird.  I've never seen a young picture of Dennis Hopper before.  Cool.  All right.  Here's part two of the story.  It was the talk of the salon at Good Hair in Seattle. 
[02:35:30]  Stylist Danielle Thomas says singling out a biracial child about her hair in front of  her peers is damaging.  It just seems like with adults and especially in the school system that they'd be more open  to the diversity and how we culturally are different and the need to approach any such.  I don't think there were differences.  The parents will only say, we're concerned and we're looking into it.  Our priority is to get the child back into school.  Now, earlier in the school year, the parents were notified that this teacher had allergies.  The NAACP plans to file a formal complaint with the U.S. Department of Education. 
[02:36:00]  Jeez.  I'm allergic to your Negro hair.  It's really allergic.  It's hurting me.  Your Afro head.  Hair is hurting.  What do you put in there?  Look, I'm sneezing like crazy.  My ass neck hurts from your Negro hair.  You think that's a bad excuse?  Of course it is an allergy.  Stop it.  I bet you the sneeze is, ha-choo! 
[02:36:30]  Just a racist.  It's hurting.  You're making my schnozola run with your black people hair.  I don't know.  I've heard the story a few different ways, so.  I'll take it from, you know, I take it from many different sources.  Yeah.  And then I call the information to get the best reasonable answer.  I mean, I feel like it was probably a hair product. 
[02:37:00]  You think?  I think it was probably a hair product that might have been left in just for a day, but  she used it on a regular basis, not necessarily dirty olive oil.  I'm leaning toward filthy olive oil festering in her hair.  I think that may be where the bias lies.  She probably just stunk.  Her hair didn't probably stunk.  Well, that's what they were saying, too, on the certain website message board that I  went to.  They were saying that perhaps it wasn't the hair that she had a body odor problem.  No, no, I mean the head.  Jesus. 
[02:37:30]  Maybe she did, but it might have...  Why don't I go from hair to body?  I'm thinking the head stunk.  I'm thinking the head must have stunk.  Yeah?  The hair product made the head stink.  So fucking wash your kid's hair.  Yeah.  How about that?  Is that the kid?  No.  It was a biracial young girl.  Make a losing weight.  Keep the regular size for the kids, and it's excellent for the kids and the parents, too.  Trayvon, doctor's mom, says programs like this are the reasons this child's school is 
[02:38:00]  so special.  Anytime they can do that, and the school is providing, it's a beautiful thing.  It helps parents.  Right.  So he can bounce off the wall.  That was a woman's voice.  So when he gets home, he doesn't do a thing.  Well, he bounces all the way home, and he crosses the threshold, and it's like, okay.  What the fuck?  No, no, no.  And while it may seem like these children are...  Why are there so many obese black women?  I really don't understand it.  Is that a cultural thing that I'm not understanding?  I think there are dietary differences in the culture that are unhealthy.  That are unhealthy? 
[02:38:30]  Yeah.  Especially in lower-income populations.  You would think they wouldn't have enough money to get that big if they were lower-income  like you said.  The fast food is cheap.  Right.  The lower-income...  Real cheap.  They fill it up with fast food places, and then you end up running fast food.  Is there knowledge in the community about the unhealthy lifestyle, that the obesity is?  I mean, somewhat, but...  I mean, that's why diabetes is also so high over there.  They call it the sweet blood, or I got the sugar.  That's why...  That's what they call it.  Yeah, you hear? 
[02:39:00]  What happened?  Yeah, I went to the doctor, man.  I got the sugar.  I got the sweet blood.  Yeah.  Because everything there is either fast food or like a bodega, and like, when you're a  kid, all you get is quarter waters.  Quarter waters?  Yeah.  What is that?  It's like the little plastic bottles with the...  That's not what I called it.  It's quarter waters.  You had a different name for it, Dan?  Danny, why don't you enlighten us?  What was the...  What's the name?  I don't know any name, but quarter water. 
[02:39:30]  Something tells me water was probably still in the word, right?  No, it was something juice.  Jesus.  I can't remember what it was, but it was something with juice after it.  I can't remember.  Oh, okay.  So, quarter water.  Quarter water.  And what is this?  It's like, you know those ice pops that are just frozen in the plastic and you squeeze  them out?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  It's basically the liquid of that.  It's just as unhealthy as you can get.  It comes in all different colors.  Does it?  And it's just, it's sugary. 
[02:40:00]  It's pure sugar?  Flavored water.  Yeah.  So, that would be unhealthy.  But like, it's 25 cents.  It's quarter water.  And there was the 50 cent one, too.  Well, those are bigger.  Yeah, those are bigger.  But like, you know, it's just fast food and junk food around there.  They would hurt my throat.  I used to drink those.  They would hurt my throat because they're too much sugar and too sweet.  Yeah.  They can't drink something that's what bothers my throat.  Yeah.  How about something salty and creamy?  That would bother my eyes and throat, depending on who the person distributing it was.  Well, we think...  I got in there and bothered my asshole.  Didn't get that bad. 
[02:40:30]  We can segue into the racist story.  The graduation card.  Did you hear about this one?  Oh, I thought you'd videotape me at home.  This is a good story, too.  The graduation card sold at local stores has been pulled from shelves after a civil rights group raised concerns about the content.  The group claims the card's micro speaker plays a greeting that's racist.  It is a graduation greeting from Hallmark.  Okay, world, we're officially putting you on notice.  Yeah!  Members of the Los Angeles NAACP. 
[02:41:00]  Is that it?  Or they can't play the part that's bad?  No, they do play it, but that was just the setup.  I'm surprised you graduated.  Out of high school, on to prison.  Is it Tablaxo they don't say?  I guess I'll say who it is.  Could be anybody.  Yeah, it could be.  Yes.  I'd like to hear who...  Nice flat hat chink, it matches your face.  That's not a very nice greeting card. 
[02:41:30]  It's terrible.  It's terrible.  The Los Angeles NAACP did take notice, and as characters known as Hoops and Yo-Yo banter on,  African-American leaders in a demeaning language.  And you black holes, you're so ominous!  And you planets, watch your back.  That was very demeaning to African-American women.  Wait, what are they...  Black holes, but they meant like...  What?  They meant like black holes in space, and planets...  What are they getting at? 
[02:42:00]  Can we replay that again?  Sure, no problem.  Or do we have it on YouTube with a better audio?  That's...  They get into it if you...  Oh!  We'll keep going.  Hold on a minute, yo.  I'm wrong.  And as characters known as Hoops and Yo-Yo banter on,  African-American leaders hear demeaning language.  And you black holes, you're so ominous!  And you planets, watch your back.  That was very demeaning to African-American women.  Where they made reference to African-American women as whores, 
[02:42:30]  and at the end says, watch your back.  Hallmark, reached by phone, says it is all a misunderstanding.  The card's theme is the solar system,  and the power of the grad to take over the universe,  even energy-absorbing black holes.  The intent here is to say, this graduate's not afraid of anything.  But that is not what was heard here.  And you hear the R in there, with the whores, and that whole, the R is...  Oh, shut the fuck up!  Stop it!  Shut the fuck up! 
[02:43:00]  That is the worst case of nothing happened,  and they're making us stink off.  So Hallmark, really?  Really?  Hallmark is going to release a card that says,  you black whores, really fucking idiots?  So they're saying the theme of the card is  the solar system and the universe,  and that a grad can take over,  you know, has the power now to go out there,  and a black hole can't get them,  and planets, watch your back,  because they're out there in the world now,  and in the universe, 
[02:43:30]  and they're going to do what they can do.  You black holes is what I first heard.  That's what I...  Of course it is!  Let me ask you a question.  Does the NAACP, or do black people,  when they make a complaint,  ever admit that maybe they jumped the gun?  Oh, God.  Ever.  Yeah, yeah.  Say, look, we're backing right out of this one.  I think we fucked up.  We misunderstood something.  Let's just leave.  Do you really think...  Are black people in this country that irrational  that you think Hallmark released a card  to be bought that said, 
[02:44:00]  hey, black whores?  I mean, come on!  Black whores.  Yeah, they decided...  Fucking stupid are you?  They decided to destroy their own company.  That would ruin them as a company.  Hallmark all of a sudden goes,  you know what,  we need to get a little edgy  and take a chance here after all these years.  The most milquetoast company.  Exactly, yeah.  The NAACP,  if they really push this,  they're just a shit organization  who is irrelevant at this point.  Ah, shit.  They really are.  Oh, man.  They did a burial for the word nigger.  They went after iMIS.  That's what you guys are doing now?  Yeah, yeah.  Targeting radio guys doing jokes 
[02:44:30]  and misheard cards?  And now they're going after greeting cards.  And Sam.  That's great.  Can we hear that again?  Sam said nappy today.  I want to hear this from here.  I thought it was in context.  I want to hear it again anyway.  It's in there.  It's not hoarse.  It's not ho.  The R is in there.  Hallmark sent us this transcript,  but Minnie Hatley says  the actual audio raises questions.  It sounds like a group of children  laughing and joking about blackness.  Again.  Hallmark is now notifying 
[02:45:00]  all its stores to pull the card.  Walgreen and CVS are doing the same.  The card maker says  the card has been out  for three years.  Did she just say the card?  She said like the card n-word.  I heard that too.  Did you hear that?  Yes, I did.  It said the card maker,  but I swear to you,  listen to it.  Listen closely.  The card.  Walgreen and CVS are doing the same.  The card maker says  the card has been out  for three years.  Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.  Come on.  Wow.  That sounded like it.  Black people mishear this  and they're actually  fucking pulling the card? 
[02:45:30]  Yeah.  Can't you just tell the N-W-A-C  to go fuck itself?  Shut up.  That isn't what it's saying.  No, that's not what it's saying.  You're hearing it wrong.  You're wrong.  This is everything that's wrong.  I want to hear that card thing again.  The card maker says  the card has been out  for three years.  This is the first time  they've received a complaint.  In any situation  where there is a circumstance  that we need to be sensitive to,  we try to learn  from that experience.  Yes, guilty white guy.  The N-W-A-C-T says  their message is clear.  And we do not want to see this  ever, ever again. 
[02:46:00]  Oh, fuck you.  You fucking piece of shit.  Shut the fuck up.  It isn't even,  it isn't even the issue.  Now this dumb motherfucker  is going back on  where we got results.  It didn't happen.  She's not the problem.  That cunt from Hallmark.  Of course.  That fucking white guilty pussy.  Instead of saying  protest all you want,  to think that we would  put out a card  that said black whores  is childish and stupid.  Listen to it. 
[02:46:30]  There's a complete explanation  for the context and everything.  They, you know what it is?  Here's what it is.  Those dumb fucks  from the NAACP  are so uneducated  and ignorant,  they don't even know  about black holes  and the solar system.  So it's fucking instantly  a racial thing  instead of  a cosmic anomaly.  You dumb fuck.  Read a book.  They actually,  now here's what happens  is you get,  it gets misheard  by one or two people 
[02:47:00]  and they go,  yeah, that could be that.  And then once  you put it out there,  instead of admitting  you're wrong  and saying,  wow,  the solar system,  first of all,  Hallmark putting out  a card that's racist  makes no business sense.  Jimmy,  the dumb cunt  did not understand  what a black hole was.  The only context  her stupid fucking mind had  was,  they're saying black hoe.  No, whore.  Or whore.  She said the R is in there.  Well, black whore,  black hole, 
[02:47:30]  black hole,  whatever the fuck it is.  She's so ignorant,  she doesn't know  about a black hole.  Not being anything  than a black woman's vagina.  But then it says  that's what she's thinking it is.  But then it says  the planet's...  Get Dr. Kaku on the phone.  He'll talk about  vaginas and black holes.  I don't want to hear  about 5,000 feet again.  Yeah, I don't either.  It is so obviously  a solar system thing.  And like,  once the organization  puts it out there,  this is why they stink.  They can't just go, 
[02:48:00]  you know what?  A mistake has been made.  We accuse this company  of something  that is obviously not true.  God forbid they should admit  that they fucked up.  Laughing at blackness.  Again.  Oh, shut the fuck up.  Fuck up.  If you understood  the context  of the solar system,  the galaxy,  the universe,  planets,  and black holes,  you would understand  what this was.  But you're so stupid  and preoccupied  with race  and finding racism  in everything 
[02:48:30]  that you don't even understand  what this is about.  Put on,  put on the science channel  one day.  Put on the fucking  science channel.  splice that into  someone's cable  and put on the science  fucking channel  and learn about it.  Dummy.  That fucking  Dummy!  That hallmark  spokesman  or CEO,  whoever he was,  that guy  is the problem.  Yeah.  Because that guy  did nothing wrong  and that guy  is acting  like he did. 
[02:49:00]  So that,  the company to me  is despicable.  The NAACP,  fuck them.  They're being assholes.  They have to know  that they're wrong  and they're still  pushing it.  But that hallmark  is reacting  like a fucking,  like they've done  something wrong.  I know.  They're totally reacting  like they were wrong.  You accuse a white  person of racism  and they just crumble  and oh my god  they're going to be  crushed by the weight  of it.  Instead of going,  no,  it's just not true.  You're an idiot.  You're wrong.  You're wrong.  You're a,  gang,  you know what?  I'm allowed to tell you 
[02:49:30]  you're wrong  without me being  branded a fucking racist.  Dude,  can we hear that again?  Because I,  fuck yourself.  I heard black holes  the first time I heard it.  Of course.  Let's listen again.  Listen for the R.  Now watch the car drops  the N-bomb.  We're all wrong.  You black holes.  You're so ominous.  Black holes.  You're so ominous.  You're demeaning language.  And you black holes.  You're so ominous.  And you black holes.  You're so ominous.  Black holes are ominous.  You black holes.  You're so ominous, right?  And you black holes.  You're so ominous. 
[02:50:00]  And as a graduate,  you're out there  in the world,  in space,  figuratively speaking.  And black holes  have nothing against you  because you just graduated.  You're so ominous.  He's mocking,  that creature's mocking  black holes  and how ominous they are.  And planets,  watch your back.  Watch your back.  I'm gonna fucking succeed  and I'm gonna...  That's the whole gist of it.  It's a dumb idea.  But racist?  Shut the fuck up.  That's what the NAACP  has fucking come to?  That's it.  Congratulations.  You are officially  a shitty, irrelevant organization. 
[02:50:30]  You've gone from Selma  to fucking greeting cards.  Congrats.  Bravo.  Bravo.  But to hear that,  to hear that,  for some dumb woman to go,  I hear the R.  No, you don't.  No, you don't.  Because you can't just admit  that there was a mistake made  because you're afraid  you're gonna look bad.  No.  Why wasn't there anyone  from the other side  saying you're ridiculous?  Because again,  white people are cowards,  petrified.  That's more infuriating.  First of all,  none of them know black people.  What's the other side  of the argument going?  You're out of your mind.  That's not what we were doing.  None of them know black people. 
[02:51:00]  So they don't know  how to talk to black people.  They're terrified.  How about here's how  you talk to them?  Are you out of your fucking mind?  That's stupid.  Do you think this card is racist?  You're stupid.  Get out of my office.  That Hallmark deserves  what they get.  Absolutely.  They completely deserve  what they get  if they're not fighting back  when it's pretty obvious  what they were going for.  Because none of these guys,  it does make a difference,  none of these guys  interact with black people.  So if they're accused of something,  instead of just talking  like they would talk  to somebody they know  and go,  that's idiotic.  Why would we do that?  They collapse and go, 
[02:51:30]  oh my God,  we're sorry it sounded that way.  Roses are red,  violets are blue.  This isn't racist.  It's anti-Jew.  Attaboy.  They should have just  sent them a card like that.  Absolutely.  Let me go to Nick.  He has more on this  from Staten Island.  Nick?  I don't think Nick  has more on this  if he's from Staten Island.  He certainly has more on this.  Nick?  Yeah, how you doing, guys?  Hey, Jimmy,  I saw you at Foxwoods last week.  You were awesome.  You killed me.  Foxwoods?  Yeah.  I wasn't there.  No, I tried.  Listen, I tried.  What does that mean? 
[02:52:00]  He just picked a place,  hoped Jimmy was there.  Oh, thanks, man.  Yeah, I bought a card  for my niece.  It's Wacko Day.  I bought a card  for my niece.  Yeah.  The birthday card,  a simple birthday card.  It said,  happy birthday to my niece.  I had a birthday cake  on or whatever.  When I got home  and looked at it closely,  it actually said,  happy birthday  to my nigga.  Like,  in real small way.  I didn't see it  until I got home now.  Are you joking?  Get out of here. 
[02:52:30]  Hallmark?  You're fucking  He's lying.  Really?  No.  Jesus.  You try to make a point.  All right.  Goodbye.  Jesus.  Why?  You try to have a discussion  and make a point  and then you get an idiot  like that.  God.  He didn't even mind  his joke.  It was just,  what's he going to contribute?  What are you doing?  Hallmark makes me sick.  There was no reason  for that guy  to apologize,  to say that we have  to be sensitive  to these things?  Fuck Waldgreens.  Yeah.  Waldgreens. 
[02:53:00]  Why is a company afraid  of the incorrect  charge of racism?  Why don't you just  deal with it  the way you would charge,  you would deal with  the incorrect charge  of tax evasion  or the incorrect charge  of anything else?  Right.  Just say that it's not true.  Yep.  And let the fucking  audio speak for itself.  It doesn't sound  like black whores.  So if a black person  came into Waldgreens  and wanted a refund  for something,  obviously not bought  in that establishment, 
[02:53:30]  would they give them  a refund?  They're wrong.  Would they do that?  Is that it?  You're just afraid  of any confrontation?  Give me a fucking break.  Are black people that,  and I don't think it's,  are black people really  that unreasonable  or irrational  that you really hear that  and you think,  do you really legitimately  think that Hallmark  as a company  said,  let's put out a card,  hmm,  that says,  black whores,  let's do that 
[02:54:00]  to really go after  the jigs.  Do you really think  that Hallmark  as a corporation,  that the biggest  fucking conservative  nerd company  on the,  Hallmark presents,  every fucking boring show  you've ever watched  was sponsored by them.  It's horrible.  I mean,  come on.  It doesn't make,  it's stupid.  Give me a break.  They were wrong.  The NAACP  was completely wrong  on this.  You had an ignorant woman  talking about a subject 
[02:54:30]  she had no knowledge of  and that's why  she got upset.  She couldn't put it  in another context  because she had no  understanding  of a black hole.  They gave her a lot of power.  They allowed her to just  spew that crap  without even challenging her.  Well,  is the news,  by the way,  is the news,  I'd love to see if the media  is mocking  these people  the way they're mocking  the tea partiers.  Oh,  absolutely not.  They're taking it  as a very serious  fucking story.  Hallmark on the hot seat  today  for a racist card. 
[02:55:00]  We got other news reports  or is it just that one?  I just saw that one.  It was like a local news thing.  That was the first one  to report.  I think everybody else  is picking it up from them.  It's amazing how they  fucking make fun of it.  What do you mean they're picking,  is any of them  going to call this lady out?  They're all going to  just pick up  on the same crap?  It's disgusting.  The news sucks.  What a fucking,  doomed,  doomed nation.  We are,  we're doomed!  You protest higher taxes,  you're called a racist.  The media  overtly  mocked  Tea Party protesters. 
[02:55:30]  The NAACP,  this  horse shit,  and they wouldn't  fucking  dare  mock the NAACP.  Call them out,  mock them.  They are so absolutely wrong  that anyone can say it,  yet  they present this as  Hallmark  pulling a racist card  because the NAACP  has dubbed it racist.  That just is amazing to me.  That's why I think  that most white people  charge of racism are.  Because it's,  again,  they're afraid of exposure. 
[02:56:00]  Instead of,  why would you,  if they said to Hallmark,  that guy,  you're a pedophile,  he would scream.  No, I'm not.  Yeah, exactly.  He would scream it.  No.  He would never buckle to that.  He actually said,  we have to look for things.  Do we have his quote anywhere?  Because I want to hear  what that dumb Hallmark  ass said again.  I would like to hear it.  He did say,  we have to be sensitive  to these things.  There's nothing  to be sensitive about.  Oh, God.  It's infuriating. 
[02:56:30]  Stuff like this  is absolutely infuriating  because it goes a lot deeper  than just this one instance.  I blame the company  more than NAACP  because, again,  I blame them both.  I blame them  for being so fucking stupid  and myopic  with their racism,  throwing out that fucking word  every two seconds.  And I blame idiots like this  for never calling them out on it.  That's why they go around  with impunity  and call out greeting cards  because no one fucking  ever calls them on shit.  And the NAACP, 
[02:57:00]  nobody in that organization  is smart enough to go,  you know,  let's think for a minute.  Why would Hallmark  mock blackness?  It's just a knee jerk.  Let's get on the fucking news.  Let's call them out.  All right, here's the  representative from Hallmark.  Hallmark, reached by phone,  says it is all  a misunderstanding.  The card's theme  is the solar system  and the power of the grad  to take over the universe,  even energy-absorbing  black holes. 
[02:57:30]  The intent here is to say  this graduate's  not afraid of anything.  But that is not  what was heard here.  And you hear the R  in there.  It's not whores.  It's not holes.  The R is in there.  Hallmark sent us  this transcript,  but Minnie Hatley says  the actual audio  raises questions.  It sounds like  a group of children  laughing and  joking  about blackness.  Oh, you dumb cunt.  Hallmark is now  notifying all its stores  to pull the card.  Of course.  Wall Green and CBS  are doing the same. 
[02:58:00]  Why, man?  They'll sell out  of these cards now.  The card has been out  for three years.  This is the first time  they've received  a complaint.  In any situation  where there is  a circumstance  that we need  to be sensitive to,  we try to learn  from that experience.  Can we get Steve Doriel  on the phone?  The NAACP says  their message.  The NAACP  I like it.  It's like a rap song.  But that woman,  the irrational,  the irrational nature  of that.  Hallmark,  just despicable.  First time they've 
[02:58:30]  received a complaint  in three years.  Somebody misunderstands  something and these  fucking faggots  pull the card?  Yeah.  What a faggot company.  Grab another,  just grab another  Hallmark card  and then me  and you,  we will accuse them.  The Opie and Anthony  show will accuse  Hallmark of  putting out a  Sexism or something.  Yeah.  Or, yeah,  some kind of,  we'll pick some subject,  ism,  and see if they  pull the card.  Hey, look,  look at this.  They would say,  no, you made a mistake. 
[02:59:00]  Oh, really?  Did we?  The only way to stop  this type of stuff  from happening  is for there to be  a public pushback,  but there never is.  No, no.  There never is.  People aren't going  to stop buying  Hallmark cards  to protest  the fucking,  the sucking the dick  of the NAACP.  I don't know.  They're not going to.  Hallmark guy  was just trying  to calm everyone down.  He's sickening.  I know,  it was stupid.  Just be honest.  He made a good point  and then he had to  go too far  and try to just  calm everyone down.  We'll learn from this.  There was no point. 
[02:59:30]  There's no reason to learn.  Yeah, there's nothing wrong.  Learn what?  What did they learn?  The fact that  you can be pushed around  by the NAACP  regardless of  if you're right or wrong  or have done anything  that you'll absolutely  accept the label  of a racist  based on a mistake  that an ignorant  son of a bitch made  because they had no clue  what they were talking about?  All right,  we got a black woman.  She wants in.  Leslie,  North Carolina.  Hi.  Hello.  As a black woman,  what are you thinking? 
[03:00:00]  I...  Do you know  what a black hole is,  by the way?  Yeah.  Of course.  I'm educated.  It seems like  the lady in that news piece  did not know  what a black hole was.  It's in space.  There you go.  Everything doesn't deal  with sex.  Right.  When someone says something.  Mm-hmm.  So what do you got on this?  You called the show.  Come on.  I know.  Well, most of the time  when I...  Like, I listen to you  every day  and sometimes, Anthony,  you do have some  off-the-wall things to say.  Like, at Halloween 
[03:00:30]  when the little black kids  took all the candy.  Well, they did.  And I would never allow  my child to do  something like that.  See?  Because you're parenting.  You're doing some parenting.  That's nice.  I think that  there's a...  Maybe not...  There's more of a  smaller group of people  who do parent their children  as black people  and the ones who  don't make  the ones who are trying  look very bad.  What do you have  on this story?  What do you think  about, like,  this type of  incorrect... 
[03:01:00]  I think they  are taking  the whole race thing  out of...  It's out of control.  Yeah, yeah.  If you don't act  like an N-word,  you won't be treated  like the N-word.  But this is...  This is...  This is the...  This is the organization  that is the  premier representation  for black America.  The NAACP.  And they are  obviously...  They're not a premier  representation for me.  Well, they are  known as the  end-all, 
[03:01:30]  do-all  organization  for black people.  Whenever there's  a problem,  an injustice,  some kind of racism,  the NAACP  steps in.  And this is a...  They've made a mistake.  And Whitey,  over there at Hallmark,  just buckled under...  They're idiots.  They need to stand up.  How come black...  Leslie,  why do black people  not speak...  I know the NAACP  has been a really  important organization  for black people  and they're not going  to just shit all over it  because of, you know, 
[03:02:00]  the occasional misfire.  But when something  like this happens,  why don't black people  complain about it  and go,  that's nonsense?  Yeah.  Well, I'm complaining  about it.  Okay.  I mean, in general.  Of course you are.  Like, I think it's a crock  of bull.  I mean, I can't speak  for everyone,  but I think it's  a crock of bull.  You played the card  and I listened  and I heard holes.  I didn't hear whore.  I didn't hear rose.  I heard an L.  There is an L in there.  Of course there is. 
[03:02:30]  Making fun of blackness.  That woman just annoyed me.  And I...  I don't know.  Actually, I was kind of shocked  that I got in,  but...  So I'm kind of nervous.  Yeah, that's all right.  That's all right.  You did all right.  All right.  Thank you, Leslie.  All right.  Well, there you go.  Maybe we could get  the Hallmark guy.  That is enraging.  Let's try to talk to him  because I want to know  what the thinking is  when you've done nothing wrong.  Nothing.  Like doing mattresses  or something  that were released at one...  Remember there was  mattress tags  that said nigger on them? 
[03:03:00]  There was something  obviously had been done  on purpose  that was really racist.  Yeah, yeah.  That's one thing.  All right, that's there.  It's meant to be there.  Occasionally you'll get  a disgruntled worker  that will fuck around  and do something  and that's got to be pulled.  But in this instance,  they are wrong.  They're wrong.  They should have been  called out as being wrong.  And it's like  people just don't talk  honestly about race.  It's embarrassing.  They're petrified.  Petrified of being  called the R word.  Oh, God.  Enough.  Don't worry about it so much.  Don't worry about it so much 
[03:03:30]  and it really is freeing.  You're able to actually  speak your fucking mind.  People that get  to label racist  for no reason  for not being a racist  are people that are  open and honest.  I'm not talking about  true racists.  Right.  There are, yes,  there are true racists  out there that are just  Out there, in here.  In here, out there.  Just full of hate  and whatever that is.  But the truth of the matter  is a lot of people  that are dubbed racist  aren't racist. 
[03:04:00]  They're speaking their minds  and the only way  to fight back at that  is to try to put that  racist label on them.  Because how else  are you going to argue  the point that  you're wrong?  Like if we step forward  to the NAACP  and said,  you're wrong.  This card is not racist.  They look at you  and immediately label  you a racist.  And then you can look  at them and go,  you are embarrassingly  irrelevant.  If you're holding  public mock funerals  targeting Imus 
[03:04:30]  and targeting a fucking  a greeting card  which is obviously  not what you're saying it is.  Right.  Like why can't  any organization realize  hey, we've made a mistake.  Are you really afraid  that all your hard work  over the years  is going to go down  the toilet if you admit  that you reacted  improperly once in a while?  Jesus fucking Christ.  Someone jumped the gun  and upon further investigation  we looked into it  and saw that there was  nothing wrong.  Yeah, we apologized  to Hallmark. 
[03:05:00]  But that woman,  that dumb woman  holding that card  it's mocking blackness.  That woman,  if you sat her down  and said  do you really think  that Hallmark  would do that  she would go  yeah.  Yes.  And then you'd have  nothing to say to her.  We have seen this before  in the past  with other things  okay, have you?  The only thing you can do  is just address  that mentality  with disgust.  Yeah.  That's it.  Alright.  That's it.  There it is.  Throw your labels around. 
[03:05:30]  Why don't we take a break  and we'll get into  some other things next.  You're gating.  We got an old interview  from David Lee Roth  1981.  Completely changes gears  I know.  But how he explains  the music of Van Halen  it's really, really douchey.  Who was this done by?  Huh?  It's an old  Entertainment Tonight  interview  when Van Halen  That's what I'm saying.  We're back!  Better than ever?  We're better than ever!  We're back!  You know,  why is he singing  we're black 
[03:06:00]  and better than ever?  You know,  we were always better.  Why sing it now?  Alright.  What do you think?  You want to do it or what?  Oh, hell yeah.  A little different  than what we're talking about.  But what the hell?  Boozy boozy bop!  Alright, we'll do  an old interview  from David Lee Roth  1981 next.  Stay there.  We're back!  We've been away 
[03:06:30]  for a long, long, long, long time  We've been through changes  We've played some games  The more things change  The more things stay the same  We've been through changes  We've never been old  to believe I find us  We're back!  We're better than ever!  We're back!  We're back!  Together forever!  We're back! 
[03:07:00]  We're back!  We're better than ever!  We're back!  We're back!  Together forever!  We're back!  We're back!  We're back!  We're back!  We're back!  We're back!  We're back!  Yeah!  We're back!  We're back!  We're back!  We're not going to go to break  We've got a teacher on the line 
[03:07:30]  getting back to the Hallmark situation  Teacher wants to talk about  how the card affects kids  Chris, Long Island  What do you got on this?  Hey fellas, how are we doing?  Happy birthday, Uncle Paul  Listen, I teach in an area  right around where you guys grew up  really close to you  Every time something like this comes up  all you hear is you hear the kids  echoing what the adults say  You always hear the kids say  Oh, you're a racist  Oh, you this, you that  And it's setting the example 
[03:08:00]  and they're always calling people ignorant  They're calling their teachers ignorant  They're calling their teachers racist  when I try to do the best I can  to really show both sides  regardless of what my opinion is  It's just setting a terrible example  I mean, they don't know what they're saying  but it's being modeled for them  so they're repeating it  So you mean, not the card's a bad example  you mean the idiotic reaction of the parents  and the NAACP?  Oh yeah, completely  Okay  Kids see this and, you know, they don't know better 
[03:08:30]  Right  So you can't blame the kids  You gotta blame the adults  But it's just, it's really creating a generation here  that it's a lot of finger pointing  It's perpetuating what's been going on for years  Believe me  But it's also like, you're a racist  has just become another angle to win an argument  Yep  That's all it is  It's another angle to get leverage or gain ground  as opposed to it being used when there's really something racist happening  That's why I don't accept it  That's why I don't accept the term whenever it's thrown around  especially in my direction  I don't accept being called a racist  Go fuck yourself  When I'm in a classroom 
[03:09:00]  I teach a social studies class  and I teach a criminal justice class  Why should I have to feel awkward  when, and I'm a white guy  Yes  Why should I have to feel awkward about  when I'm in criminal justice  and I'm talking about racial profiling  or I'm talking about  you know, if we're talking about civil rights  and I have to show certain pictures  and there's some things I can't show  and some things I can't show  Why should I have to feel awkward about  Yeah, you're walking on eggshells  Yeah  I don't see why it should happen 
[03:09:30]  I'm like, we're forced to show  the Obama inauguration speech  I was never forced to show any other inauguration speech  Yeah, it's like, you know  Wow  Teachers are just  And you're not allowed to talk about the  validity of racial profiling either  You got a tough job there, Chris, on Long Island  Yeah  Steve Doyle, hold on one sec  Steve Doyle will not come on air  Whatever was on TV  Something, press  is all he had to say  Okay  I can't read your writing  The coward has 
[03:10:00]  The coward said what the coward had to say  You actually got him?  Yeah, I just talked to him  And what did he say?  He said, whatever you've read in the press  whatever statements have been made in the press  What a fucking coward  is all I'm going to say on the matter  I said, okay, well look  If I go to my guys  and they have another question  would you be amenable to talking to me  off the air again?  So it's basically  He won't come on the air directly  And he's  And what he  And the language he used  was the very antiseptic language  that was used  Of course  Of course  He's just trying to comment on one down  He's sending out a statement  in a greeting card later 
[03:10:30]  Yeah  You know what?  If people are bothered  not by Hallmark yanking the card  because you care about the card  but by another company  buckling to a false charge of racism  Yeah  It's a fucking lie  and they buckled to it  So if people are tired  you shouldn't buy Hallmark cards  and you should call and tell them  We're tired of this  knee-jerk reactionary garbage  being treated if it's valid  We got Dan in Canada  Thanks Chris  Thank you Chris  He works for Hallmark  Dan  Canada 
[03:11:00]  Can you really add to this or what?  Well, I just wanted  I got to defend the company a little  Loads the trucks  Amy  But, I mean, it's so easy  to just pull a card  It takes two seconds  But that's called buckling, man  Yeah, but it's the fucking thing  the ideology behind pulling the card  It's the principle  It's the principle of it  It's then adding ammunition  to the next time someone makes  a dumb knee-jerk reaction  that has no validity to it 
[03:11:30]  to then have the other company  do the easy thing  How about the head  You're giving power  The spokesperson for Hallmark  By doing that  Calls them out and says  No, you're wrong  We're not pulling this  Sir, what you're saying is  it's a business  They're out to make money  not change the world  So if this just shuts everybody up  and they can continue to make money  it's worth it  No, I wouldn't put it  in those words, Jimmy  Well  You're putting words in my mouth  Well, no, I'm asking you  what your intent is  You say it yourself  My apologies  You say it 
[03:12:00]  Jimmy, that was a question  more than a statement  by Jimmy  He was asking you  Go ahead  Your words  Absolutely  But I'm just saying  I don't really think  that Hallmark is the company  that's going to make this stand  And it's  I'd love to see the company  that does  But with  You're no kidding  You know, the mission  that Hallmark has  with social expression  This isn't exactly something  that's going to be  top of the list  for us to do  Wait, their mission  is social expression?  Well, you know 
[03:12:30]  I haven't got it  in front of me  but that's  one of the  main things we do  They didn't have a problem  with the card  for three years  Now this is Steve  Doyle quote about this  That's what he said  He said  We spent a hundred years  bringing people together  Why would we intentionally  try to push them apart?  That's a great quote  and that's what he should have said  and left the card  on the shelves  Yep  Without a doubt  I'm just a sales guy  I'm just saying  your CEO  or whoever he is  is a coward  and to me 
[03:13:00]  he is almost saying  that the charges of racism  are accurate  by yanking the card  You know, you can look  at it that way  Last thing I would think  is that we've got  a line of cards  called Mahogany  that's specifically  for us  Of course you do  A line of cards  called Mahogany  Yeah, of course  Yeah  Because black people  need their own cards  They don't want to see  white people all the time  on cards  I do get that  Yeah, yeah  I usually buy those  for my mom  As a goof, so do I  Yeah, I buy those  All white people do  We all think 
[03:13:30]  We all think it's funny  to buy from the ebony line  We don't know how to say  I love you for real  so we buy black people  saying it  and we're like  I'm just kidding  to my girlfriend  Look  All right, Dan, thanks  But that's good  Yeah  Yeah, they put out  a Mahogany line  so black people  have cards  that they don't always  have to have  little smiling  white faces on them  Yeah  And still  the NAACP  would be  fucking stupid enough  Yeah  to take on this one  Oh, fuck  To think that they're 
[03:14:00]  doing something like that  Ugh  All right  We said it  Let's take a break  We'll continue in just a bit  Looking at pictures  of Miley Cyrus  Talking about her  what, feet stinking?  Yeah, Danny suggested  that she might have feet stink  We're looking at new pictures  of her from a concert  and the photographer  was nice enough  to get a couple  of upskirt shots of her  so you could kind of see  up her skirt  and her little panties  She's looking very hot  these days  Did you ever get into  the upskirt pics? 
[03:14:30]  Yes  A few of them  They look pretty good  Thanks to my videos  from the porn shop  upskirts guys  that would follow chicks  from the mall  I would jerk off  for hours to those  Yeah  Yeah, just silent  with fucking  the guy had the thing  in a baggie  in a bag  or in a double bag  Yeah, and he'd  place it down  Yeah, next to her  Yeah  Yeah, Miley Cyrus  is looking good  and then Danny  brought up the fact  that she looks like  she has foot stink  Yeah, there's gotta be  something wrong  Something wrong  with her  You know what I'm saying?  And then Jimmy suggested  that that would be good 
[03:15:00]  like it would  be a turn on  I like feet that smell  a little bit  I'm not a foot fetish guy  but I've smelled  I'm not talking about  a cheesy, disgusting  fucking fungus odor  I'm talking about  a girl with nice feet  who's been like  walking in sneakers a lot  and her feet just stink  but it's a sexy smell  Fuck, dude  I could fuck a chick  and put them in my face  and just blow a load in her  Yeah  That turns me on so much  I've always said  the foot is part  of the whole package  with a girl  It's gotta be like  it can't look like 
[03:15:30]  a fucking talon  You can't have  the ligaments  that go from  the fucking toe knuckle  all the way up to  almost the middle  of their shin  Like I hate that  that whole thing  Nasty  But the  like a little bit of  you know it's a foot  kind of smell  like you know  I go  that lasts  till they pass  that threshold  old of 20  21  Not as sexy  And then it's not sexy  it's just  hey wash your feet  Maybe there's a little  shit on it  you know  It lets you know  it's a foot  Mind if a girl  still 
[03:16:00]  little shit  I think it's funny  that you said  I've always said  that  I've always said  like for years  you've been saying  I've been saying  this  For two years  For years  I've been saying  this  It's like  Technically two years  is years  Cause there's an age  where it's like  aww  she doesn't know  how to clean  herself yet  Jesus  Yeah  I've never gotten  into the feet  and certainly  not stinky feet  No  Not stinky  I like a pussy  I like no deodorant 
[03:16:30]  I'm sure you're not alone  Jimmy  I'm just  I don't know  No deodorant  fucking underarm smell  if it's clean  Fuck  drives me crazy  A nice foot is good  if you could grab it  and you know  you're placing legs  up over  and you're grabbing  the foot  instead of like  the thighs  or the calves  What about stocking feet?  Just grab the foot  You ever interlock it  No I don't like stocking feet  Danny just shook his head  Don't like stocking feet  Why are you interlocking  the feet with my hands?  Never  I wouldn't like that feeling  No I kind of like  taking my fingers  you put it in between  their toes a little bit  and like grab their feet  like that  and then you go  No 
[03:17:00]  But if you suck  a girl's toes  while you're fucking her  that will drive her crazy  fuck a girl  and hold her foot  and put her foot  in your mouth  and suck her toes  Yeah  I'm telling you  because I've gotten  my toes sucked  it feels fucking good  because you're not used  to getting  it's a weird sensation  on your feet  and a girl  for me it's just  a distraction  so she doesn't have  to realize  it's my dick  actually in her  she doesn't have  to realize  the incompetence  with which she's  being fucked  that's a great mouth  on my feet  oh yeah  and that thing  in me  but the girls 
[03:17:30]  like their fucking  toes being sucked  I don't like that  stocking thing though  Why?  Stockings are  a little too  it just reminds me  of like  your aunt  Yeah  yeah  exactly  it's like a  matronly thing  there's some  thigh high fishnets  look great  shit like that  but just like  regular hose  stockings  things like that  ain't doing the trick  thigh highs are sexy  thigh highs are sexy  but not like  you know  I'm wearing 
[03:18:00]  legs  and the color  is nude  like something  like that  is amazing  fishnets  we're looking at  some picture  of girls  she's doing a  really nice  leggy pose  and she's got  fishnets on  up to her  mid thighs  and the fishnets  have that built in  almost lacy  garter thing  up at the top  lacy  and it just  looks really hot  nice brunette  what's nice about  fucking a girl  when she's wearing  feels good on your  dick everything 
[03:18:30]  I guess that is  the nice part  and the  not so nice part  is putting her  back in the box  and shoveling  the dirt on top  of her  cause I fuck  dead people  you saved  yourself  I love  the way  thigh highs  will frame  the girl's  ass  when you're  fucking  someone  and they have  the thigh highs  it's just like  the ass is framed  so nicely  it does too  cause it's got  like that 
[03:19:00]  I don't know  if it's elastic  whatever it's got  in there  that holds it up  it kind of  compresses the thigh  and it makes the  ass cheeks pop out  just that much more  a little more meat  coming out  like a toothpaste tube  I'll actually squeeze  a girl's feet  really hard  and take a roller  and roll all the way  up to make her  asshole bubble out  a little bit  like a balloon  animal  you make her  prolapse from  squeezing her feet  yeah her fucking  feet  and like from  the thigh down 
[03:19:30]  it looks like  just fucking  fruit roll ups  and her assholes  bubbling out  I love that  that turns me on  a lot  fucking lunatic  well we got an  interview from  David Lee Roth  I know we're  changing gears  drastically here  but this has been  sitting in front of  us for a while  David Lee Roth  1981  talking about  Van Halen  and we listened  to one of the  clips that makes  absolutely no sense  yeah I was gonna  say I bet he makes  a lot of sense  at this point  he's 25 years old  and he explains  Van Halen music  to everybody  just in case they 
[03:20:00]  don't know what  it's all about  Van Halen  heavy metal music  any kind of rock  music  is what I call  high velocity  folk music  I look at  heavy metal music  Van Halen's  brand rather  of heavy metal  music  as a combination  of religion  and hockey  what?  religion  and hockey  what?  what was he 
[03:20:30]  babbling about?  religion  and hockey  he's trying to be  edgy  he's trying to be  profound  I don't even  I don't know  what he's trying  he's just not  on his level  man  you just don't  understand  DLR  yeah  he's  people bought  this shit  for a long time  not like you know  bought this shit  like the music  I mean they  bought his  act  is Van Halen  one of those bands  that get less 
[03:21:00]  cool as the years  go on?  oh yes  there's a whole list  of those type  of bands  yeah  because there was  a time  people were like  fucking A  Van Halen  coolest of the cool  David Lee Roth  a lot of people  were on  rock star  absolutely  but now you look  back  not so much  now you look back  in embarrassment  not so much  a little bit  right  well David Lee Roth  continues  he picks up a guitar  compares a banker  to a rock and roller  and then tosses  the guitar 
[03:21:30]  he's a wild man  a banker  picks up the guitar  and goes like this  and a rock and roller  goes like that  he's outrageous  he's such an asshole  David Lee Roth invites  the ET cameras  this is 1981  81?  yes  inside the band's  filthy apartment  and continues to make 
[03:22:00]  non-sensical descriptions  about the band's music  when the Van Halen image  began taking shape  I started spending  more time in bed  actually  as you can see  Van Halen is not  terribly image conscious  we just sort of  let it all be  you know  we're not really poets  we're not really  philosophers  we just sort of  go about our merry way  and the music  is a soundtrack  for that  people are really  accusing him  of being a poet  and philosopher 
[03:22:30]  just like Dylan  you're right  David Lee Roth  you were just like Dylan  that's great  more David Lee Roth  Van Halen  is not the way we are  because we're in  a rock and roll band  we had to get into a band  because we are this way  when I was maybe  8 years old  the doctors said  I was hyperactive  and they told my parents  oh we have to put Dave  on Ritalin therapy  and all of this  because every night  at dinner  when I get the blood sugars up 
[03:23:00]  I'd start ticky-tacking  with the knives and forks  on the table  and I'd start telling jokes  and singing commercials  on television  and everything  and the folks would say  to the company  now don't worry about David  he's just doing  what we call monkey hour  and I have successfully  turned monkey hour  into a career  sorry  it's amazing  how many years  it took for everyone  to know that bell 
[03:23:30]  let's say hi to Rob  in Garden City  Rob  hey Jimmy  have you ever noticed  it's pretty sexy  every now and again  when you go in the bathroom  and you notice  your girlfriend  will leave a little present  in a toilet bowl for you  like a little milk nut  because I've never had to deal  with that every now and again  nah I've never had that  honestly  I don't know if I like that  in the toilet  that's disgusting  did you deal with that  like it was a gift to you  or something disgusting  uh no  I actually  after it happened  twice  I actually had to turn 
[03:24:00]  to my wife  and be like  look  I don't care  if you're in a rush  and it's like  you know  World War 3  happening  or something like that  make sure you flush  that fucking bowl  flush and make sure  it goes down  yeah  anyone has any idea  that you've like  ever been in there  nothing worse than  lifting up that lid  and seeing a nugget  a fucking milk dud  floating around in there  that you know isn't yours  it looks just like  a milk dud too  a fuzzy milk dud  it's been in there a while  it's starting to come apart  looks like a fuzzy milk dud  too much water  yeah 
[03:24:30]  and it's got like  in the middle of it  and there's like  discoloration on the bottom  of the bowl  like it's been steeping  like a teabag  it looks like the log  took a piss  madam did you drop  a pissing log  into the toilet  I certainly did  it gets a bit rusting  Jesus Christ  it gets rusting  thank you Rob  alright  alright well look  Pat from Monaki  knows how to take lemon  and make lemonade  he goes  at least  it's not on the tip  of his dick  little nugget 
[03:25:00]  that's the worst  oh god  you pull your cock out  it looks like a dirty  tea square  it's like  well are you gonna  wash your dick  or do architectural work  hey hammerhead cock  stinking up the  fucking living room  holy shit  that's  fucking disgusting  you know what's worse  what's worse than  fucking a girl in the ass  and then you don't  even look down  and then as you're  doing your jumping jacks  the nugget falls off  your cock head  and stains the linoleum  who hasn't had that 
[03:25:30]  happen a dozen times  god do I not miss  regular radio  oh god Danny  what a picture  what is that blood  or shit  that's terrible  that's a loose stool  she has nice socks though  I like those  Freddy Krueger  sweater socks  she has a great body too  except for the  fucking liquidy shite  coming out  over that guy's  horrible one ball balls  he has one ball balls  I despise that man's balls 
[03:26:00]  I like to sink my teeth  to them  and not in a  homosexual way at all  but in an act of  aggression  fucking rage  one ball balls  you know those balls  yeah they're all  tightened up from  fucking and only one  is showing  Florentine has one  ball balls  does he  yeah  how do you know  he showed them to me  how do I know  that hornet's nest  I've seen them for  fucking 20 years  they're legendary  he's got big balls  but it makes one  big ball  he would just stand  in front  I remember one time  he would just get  in front of my car  when the headlights  were on  and just show me 
[03:26:30]  his bag  and then get back  in the car  I told him  I want to take  his balls  and put them  on the ground  and hit it  with a brick  like caps  are you talking  to Florentine  today  or is that tomorrow  tomorrow  is any part  of your Raw Dog  show  that's Thursday  Thursday  tomorrow's the  Boneyard premiere  but Thursday  Jim will be my  co-host on Raw Dog  this week  going out  we're doing it  live again  ah nice  um well  the Dave Lee Roth  is not really  going anywhere  do you want  the last clip  or it doesn't matter  we might as well  I kind of like  here in a 1981 
[03:27:00]  what's wrong  with that guy's balls  oh  yeah come on  that's not real  it's a style  man  style is everything  style is not to be  confused with class  a Mercedes Benz  is class  because it represents  money  however  chili dogs  have absolutely  no class  but a great deal  of style  and punk rock  new wave  whatever you have  reggae  rastafari  haircuts  what have you  are all different  kinds of styles  none of them 
[03:27:30]  however have any  class  I got class  anyone ever ask  them what the fuck  are you talking about  or they just let them  babble like this  what are you talking  about Dave  a chili dog  has a lot of class  see chili dogs  got class  does it  what  or style  did he say style  I don't know  who knows  makes you shit  that shit makes you shit  wow  he uh  he was a rock star  though  he was the epitome  the epitome 
[03:28:00]  of rock star  name another band  not as cool  as the years go by  I think Van Halen  is definitely in that category  you can put a lot of hair bands  in that category  I'd say Kiss  not as cool  as much as I loved Kiss  not as cool  as the years go by  honestly no  no that's it  that's a good one  yeah  that's a good one  yeah  Motley Crue continues  to be kind of cool  not as cool  as the years go by though  well you can't look at it  in terms of  when they were  on their  like game  and at their peak  right  and now  you gotta look at it 
[03:28:30]  like  it just  it's not working anymore  right  you know  like  like there's some bands  that  that were huge  and just aren't huge anymore  but they're still cool  to listen to  hmm  yeah  that's a tough one  kind of  I guess you're right  how about the Cars  the Cars  the Cars  were a giant band  that was played  on rock radio  but they were giant  they were played  on rock radio  I don't know 
[03:29:00]  if they ever were  cool  they had cool songs  they were like  like  the  one of the first  accepted punk bands  like the Clash  came out  and that seemed like  the punk  sellout band  because they got popular  Cars  as a  yeah  they were mainstream  man  yeah  they were mainstream  but  you wouldn't turn them off  if they were on  B&B  they have some alright songs  Judas Priest is a good example  P-Roll  oh that's a good one 
[03:29:30]  my boy from Philly  Judas Priest  not as cool  when you realize  the fucking  I didn't say the Cars  were punk  I said they were like  they were like  New Wave  as soon as you found out  the Lee Singer was gay  I mean you still want to  enjoy the music  but maybe not as cool  yeah  although he kept  his fucking fan base  god bless him  he's coming in soon  right  Rob Halford  I think is coming in  I think we got him  booked for another appearance  how about Genesis  they were like  huge lead  Genesis  they were huge  you're forgetting  that these were played  on rock radio  I actually saw Genesis 
[03:30:00]  during the Overcap tour  like crazy  and now you wouldn't  fucking give him  the time of day  it's kind of embarrassing  to say you liked  Genesis ever right  but there was a time  people would be like  yeah fucking Genesis  people have misunderstood  what I said  I'm not comparing  the Cars  and the Clash  I'm saying they were  out at the same time  you kind of did  but one is  New Wave pop  and one is punk  and they both came out  of like kind of  that punk culture thing  like even New Wave  came out of  the punk culture  Travis do you have  something to add to this 
[03:30:30]  no I'm just listening  to you trying  trying to talk  my way out of it  shut up  you're on your last  t-shirt of the  fucking week  I certainly am  yeah  football t-shirt  in baseball season  I have nothing  so I had to attack  you on your shirt  I'm sorry  you're right  Trap Dog's shirt  is fucking horrible  Trap Dog knows  I love him  you know what  Ken in Texas  makes a good point  about this Van Halen  Ken  yes  what  I never thought  they were heavy metal  yeah I know 
[03:31:00]  I mean come on  yeah David Lee Roth  in there said  something about  heavy metal  I'm like heavy metal  Van Halen  heavy metal's had  some weird definitions  over the years  as to who is heavy metal  and who's not  yeah and we all know  who is truly  the greatest heavy metal band  because they won an award  for best heavy metal act  Jethro Tull  Jethro fucking Tull  Jethro MF  Tull  Tull  is what they call  Tull Tull 
[03:31:30]  yeah  alright thank you Ken  yep no problem  so we did the  the Van der Sloot  we did the Helen Thomas  Van der Sloot  we did Obama  looking for someone's  ass to kick over  the oil spill  that's just  fucking babble  we talking about  Helen Thomas  you guys hit on that  well a little bit  I mean  what was the thing  do you agree with her  being pretty much  forced out  no she should be able  to have an opinion  on something  it's an opinion  it's a fucking opinion  you're not supposed  to like every opinion  yeah so what  she said 
[03:32:00]  and this is going to  make other people  not give their opinion  and that's why  this type of thing  is really really bad  especially in the  United States of America  yeah absolutely  you should have an opinion  no matter what you do  for a living  in this fine country  of ours  and now  it shut up  her  and it's going to  shut up a lot  of other people  and you're having  people in the administration  say that  it's an outrage  what she said  oh they did  and intolerable  and it's like  wait a minute  that was a fucking  a statement  that she made  she was asked  what her feelings  about Israel were 
[03:32:30]  and she said  that that's  Palestinian land  and they should  go back to  Germany  and Poland  and the United States  now whether you  agree with it or not  that's her opinion  is it anti-Semitic  no it's an opinion  on who is entitled  to that land  some people believe  the Jews are  some people believe  the Palestinians are  and that's  hence the battle  that's been waged  for quite some time now  and I actually do think  that she's anti-Semitic  I actually think  she doesn't probably  like the Jews that much 
[03:33:00]  but I don't think  that was an anti-Semitic  statement that she made  but even if she is  so what  her opinion is valid  of course  and I don't care  if she likes Jews  it's not my fucking business  I don't care  if she likes blacks  I don't care  how she feels about me  she's allowed to  when asked  give her opinion  it didn't affect her job  for the last 50 years  her opinion  she was honest  about being a flaming liberal  she was very very open  about it  it was no secret  to anybody  she wasn't like  most journalists  who are pretending  they are something  that they're not  George Bush never  panked on her 
[03:33:30]  he couldn't stand her  he hated her  she could be right up front  going oh oh oh  me me me me  and George  right over her head  and good for him  he didn't honor the tradition  he thought she was a cunt  and he was right  and I don't even agree with her  but so what  I don't have to  what a way to end  a career  a 50 year career  fuck her too  just putters out  she Jimmy the Greek  she never should have  walked away  she's 89 fucking years old  she should have had some balls  and said I'm not leaving  fuck you  she can move on to a new career  exactly  a corpse  pillow warmer  a fucking jaw dropper 
[03:34:00]  nothing better though  when someone is just  minding their own business  and someone asks their opinion  they always fuck up  she's just walking  across a lawn  it's a nice summer day  it was like nothing  hey by the way  she was just minding  her own business  she wasn't gonna say that  that day  let me ask you  this career ender  and she's kind of smiling  as she's saying it  she's kind of having a good time  with the whole thing  and now she's out  yeah I think she should  absolutely  she needed to go  many many years ago  and let some young  fucking person in there 
[03:34:30]  to do the job  why not  to 89 enough  hasn't she earned the right  to say what she wants  obviously not  hasn't she fucking  after being  90 years old  how about something called  the benefit of the doubt  give her one  after all these years  just give her  90  give the old bag  years old  fucking 90  she got photos with Kennedy  she was there with Eisenhower  who gives a shit  yeah  so what  fuck  this fucking country stinks  her opinion is that 
[03:35:00]  the Jews do not belong  in Israel  now  you might not agree with it  but  but  Jesus Christ  the woman just said it  so what  that's her ideology  that's her fucking opinion  and she made a statement  when questioned about it  and then they crucify her  no pun  nobody handles  being under fire well  like the only way to handle  being under fire  when you're accused of something  you didn't do  or that is ridiculous  is to be belligerent  I really believe that 
[03:35:30]  yeah yeah  it really works  it does  really does  so she's out  Obama  is he really going to kick  people's asses  over this oil spill  we discussed that earlier too  he said  kicking ass  ass to kick  was the exact quote  someone's ass to kick  someone's ass to kick  wouldn't that someone be  BP  BP is an entity  he needs a single ass  he needs  he needs one crack  with two 
[03:36:00]  bump bulges  next to it  one singular ass  I love the tough talk  50 days in  yeah  50 fucking days  this thing has been  doing its thing  good luck kicking ass  and we did the Apple  we did the iPhone thing  yeah  Hall and Oates  we did that  we could do birthdays  want to wish  a very very happy birthday  to a little boy  named Colin Quinn  that was just his birthday 
[03:36:30]  the other day  oh really  yeah  Colin was getting  birthday wishes  from everybody  especially Chip  yeah  Chip was giving him  birthday wishes  on the Twitter  I sent him one  Colin  I said something about  how many candles  you got on there  like you know  90 or something  you know  it was some little joke  about his age  he found it  very funny Chip  no one else did  Woody and Phil  Jim you want to  comment on this 
[03:37:00]  no  next time Jim says  this country stinks  I'm buying him  a one way  a one way ticket  to Congo  the one way ticket  and then he ends  it with  first class  fucking douche  would you take  a one way ticket  to Congo  I would prefer  he called in  instead of writing  but I think  cunt  that you know  what I mean  and there is  a frustration  Woody  there's a lot  of fucking weird  things going on  in our country  right now  it's very frustrating  and you need  people fighting back  I'll say it again  against the man  and the establishment  the mentality 
[03:37:30]  in this country  fucking stinks Woody  absolutely  the mentality  in this country  fucking stinks  and how about  you take the  context of the  statement  this country stinks  based on what  Jimmy was talking  about before he  said it  he didn't just  say this country  stinks  like everything  in this country  stinks  what stinks  is that you  you have  such a lack  of freedom  of speech  without consequences  now of course  speech has consequence  we all know that  but there are now  consequences based 
[03:38:00]  on opinion  and things that  there should not  be such  rash consequence  it used to be  called debate  you used to be able  to debate with  somebody without  consequence of  losing your job  based on your  opinions  now it's  gone way beyond  the fucking  proverbial  fire in the  movie theater  screaming fire  in the movie  theater  that it's got  consequences  you can't even  fucking have an  opinion  without being  hung up to  dry by  some fucking  interest group  or what they 
[03:38:30]  think is popular  opinion  when it's not  it's disgusting  this country  stinks  it really does  yeah it's got  some problems  right now  so where's my  ticket Woody  yeah  I said it again  this country  stinks  where's my  ticket to  Congo  fucking horrible  example of a  place to get a  ticket for  can you bring  swim trunks  would you go  if you gave  you a good seat  business or  first only  I don't fly  coach  I'm just saying  if you gave  you a good  seat would you  go  and check it  out  I want to see  what shit talk  you have to  get a lot of
