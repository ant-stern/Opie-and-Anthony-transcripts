<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a discussion of Groundhog Day, focusing on Punxsutawney Phil and other groundhogs, punctuated by the hosts' familiar jaded commentary and hampered by technical difficulties with a live feed.  This transitioned into a critical analysis of a Mitt Romney soundbite where he stated he wasn't concerned about the very poor, followed by speculation on his potential running mate.  The segment included several caller segments; one caller shared a traumatic childhood story involving death, another detailed an inappropriate home economics teacher, and a third was unexpectedly pulled over by the police while on the phone with the show.  The hosts briefly reviewed "Bridesmaids," and mentioned Rich Voss as an upcoming guest.

A lengthy, highly offensive and vulgar argument between two unidentified individuals followed, filled with insults targeting physical appearance, intelligence, and sexual activity. This was followed by a discussion of a scene from *Bridesmaids*, praising Kristen Wiig's performance.  The show then featured Rich Voss, promoting his stand-up shows at the Governors Comedy Club.  This led to a heated disagreement over Voss’s compensation for a favor his wife, Bonnie, had done for another comedian, Jimmy,  peppered with personal attacks and strong language.  The death of Angelo Dundee was also briefly mentioned. The segment concluded with a sexually explicit "Cock Talk" segment featuring a caller's graphic description of his first homosexual experience and a brief discussion of Voss's in-laws' reaction to his comedy.

Next, Opie and Anthony recounted a dinner with their wives, including a humorous anecdote about receiving unwanted champagne from fans and encountering attractive women.  A playful, slightly tense exchange ensued about their wives finding the other's spouse more fun.  The conversation shifted to gambling experiences in Atlantic City, with Anthony detailing a lucky blackjack run and Opie recounting his gambling misadventures, including losing a paycheck.  Opie also mentioned his wife’s success with slot machines.  A caller, Greg from DC, corrected Anthony about the likelihood of encountering pythons on a Florida golf course, leading to further banter.  The segment included an audio clip from their podcast "My Wife Hates Me" featuring Rich Voss singing, and concluded with further discussion of their anxieties and self-consciousness.

The show continued with a discussion of radio personalities, including Sean Hannity, Geraldo Rivera, and the deceased Lynn Samuels, whose death the hosts reacted to with surprise and speculation (incorrectly stating she had been raped before clarifying the cause of death was unknown).  This led into a contest for the worst best man speech, with a winning entry from “Dr. Steve” played on air; this was followed by discussions of Dr. Steve’s life and work as a hospice doctor, with darkly humorous anecdotes about death and dying.  The hosts also discussed Don Cornelius's death, speculated about suicide, and dedicated a brief, unexplained Black History Month segment to the "Crying Guy" from *Intervention*. The segment concluded with promotional plugs for Rich Voss and a discussion about Tracy Morgan's family issues.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver. Let's get the show on the road.  Morning.  Hi.  Hello. Hello.  We're ready to broadcast.  Greetings.  And salutations.  I'm with Ant.  Yeah.  Woke up today to realize that it's Groundhog.  Is it Groundhogs or Groundhog?  Groundhog Day, right?  It's just Groundhog Day, but everyone says Groundhog's Day.  Today's Groundhog Day?  And I think you said it properly. 
[00:00:30]  You're like, didn't we just do this shit?  I honestly, and not a bit, not a, you know, Groundhog Day movie thing,  but I really honestly feel like we just did Groundhog Day.  I remember vividly us discussing the various Groundhogs around the country,  making fun.  We did kind of a simulcast from Gobbler's Knob where we were talking about  what was going on.  We potted up the volume when the guy gave his long-winded dumb speech.  Everything we will do today, by the way. 
[00:01:00]  Well, that was a quick year.  Yeah.  Say goodbye to that year.  Flew by.  Because it does feel like we just did that.  Honestly.  We insulted Punxsutawney Phil.  Yes.  Jimmy, by the way, loves Punxsutawney Phil.  He's a big fan.  Every year we just hear him just talking about how wonderful Punxsutawney Phil is  and how fun and good-spirited the whole thing is.  There's so many people there.  They just showed a live shot.  It is packed.  Packed out.  Has to be, how many?  Thousands.  Thousands of people there at the Gobbler's Knob. 
[00:01:30]  I want to say hi.  I'm sure there's one dummy listening to us right now in that crowd.  What are you doing?  Why are you there?  At home.  I'm wasting time.  I know.  And we all know spring already hit, especially for New York.  The Pontificator of Pontificators.  The guy's going to get his dumb speech with his big stupid hat.  Well, you know, they got the main one, though.  Punxsutawney Phil is the main one.  That is the main one.  And Travis, you know, like the movie Groundhog, 
[00:02:00]  we're going to do the exact same bit we do every year.  Every year.  And Travis goes, I already know what you guys are going to say and do,  and it's still going to be hilarious once again this year.  He goes, here it is.  Here's the list.  But this list, man, there's a drop-off after Punxsutawney Phil.  Of course, you got Staten Island Chuck,  which could be the second most popular Groundhog, right?  Yeah.  Then you got Sutton Sammy from Sutton, Ontario.  Then you got French Creek Freddy from West Virginia. 
[00:02:30]  Then you got just Tumbleweed in Brooksfield, Illinois.  Wait, live.  Is it happening now?  No.  Not this early.  I think they're just showing.  They're just fooling around a little bit.  Yeah, this is them fucking around.  What is he saying, though?  Because they need the sun, Jimmy.  The sun's not out yet.  It's all about shadows.  What are those people?  They're wearing, like, different colored shirts?  A bunch of girls?  Who is this?  Leslie Nielsen?  Can we get this on there, Mars?  We're talking about it.  We kind of need to listen to this. 
[00:03:00]  Mars.  Please.  Get to Mars.  No, this is the pregame, man.  Ah, let's see.  It's done.  Too late, Mars.  You need the sun.  Good timing, Mars.  Good job.  No, no.  And don't put it on the top.  What I do?  Don't put it on the top.  No.  What I do?  You always trip you wanted on.  Huh?  Just put it back to what it was.  Yeah, it just, it just too late.  It just doesn't matter.  Everything's spiraled.  No.  You're ruined dead.  No, we need the sun, because it's all about the shadows, so.  Oh, that's.  So, they won't be doing this until probably seven or so. 
[00:03:30]  Then you got Tumbleweed.  Then you got Smithlake Jake in Graysville, Alabama.  You got Gus in Athens, Georgia.  Octoraro, Orfe in Pennsylvania, another town in Pennsylvania.  Why do you even bother in Pennsylvania?  I don't know.  The big guy, the big act is there.  Yeah, you should just simulcast Punxsutawney, right?  Yeah.  Balzac Billy.  That's Dr. Gay's favorite.  He was in here before saying how he loves the Balzac.  Balzac.  Sir Walter Wally in Raleigh. 
[00:04:00]  Oh, Sir Walter Wally of Raleigh.  Grady the Groundhog in Chimney Rock, North Carolina.  Frit.  Chuckles in Manchester, Connecticut.  Why don't they just simulcast the main guy?  Is that where Voss is playing?  Chuckles, yeah.  Yeah, a lot of these sound like comedy clubs.  Yeah.  Uh, Susquehanna Sherman in Mount Wolf, Pennsylvania.  Man, Pennsylvania's all about it.  Oh, another one.  Poor Richard in York, Pennsylvania.  That's what I said when he got the AIDS.  If he tried to blow me. 
[00:04:30]  You're going to have another lifetime of homosexuality when my dick popped out of its zipper.  Now it's doomed us all, hasn't it?  Dover Doug in Pennsylvania.  Oh.  Malvern Mel in good old Malvern, New York out there in Long Island.  Wow.  Malvern Mel.  Oh, competing with Holtzville Howe.  Holtzville Howe. 
[00:05:00]  Out in Holtzville, Long Island.  Then you just got Ooni in Meierstown, Pennsylvania.  Uh, Wyarton Willie, it looks like, right?  Yeah.  From Wyarton, Ontario.  That one I can't even pronounce.  From Shubbin, Shubbinacady, Sam?  Shubbinacady.  From Shubbinacady, Nova Scotia.  Is that like Newfie shit?  That's crazy.  Is that Newfie shit?  All right.  What a silly name for a groundhog.  And Jimmy the Groundhog. 
[00:05:30]  Yay!  What a sweet groundhog.  Jimmy.  From Sun Prairie, Wisconsin.  Where's the sweater?  Jimmy the Groundhog.  He's a sweater boy groundhog cutie.  He pops out and nothing about his behavior is cookie cutter.  Oh.  There we go.  Uh, Stormy Mormont, it looks like.  We're almost done.  Mountain, uh, Marilyn Mary.  Uh, Buckeye Chuck.  Dunkirk Dave.  That's Dunkirk, New York.  And, uh, General, uh, what is that? 
[00:06:00]  Beauregard Lee from, uh, Liberna, Georgia.  So that's just a...  A little burn, Georgia.  A few of the groundhogs.  Wow.  It's gonna be cloudy, so that means it doesn't see its shadow, which means, uh, it's gonna be  a short fucking winter, right?  That's what happens?  Yeah.  When you don't see the shadow?  I think he doesn't see the shadow.  What, how does it work?  He sees his shadow.  He gets scared.  He runs back into his fucking hole.  And, uh, what happens?  We get more winter?  Oh, then that means spring's around the corner. 
[00:06:30]  But if he sees his shadow, then what, six more weeks of winter?  Yeah, something like that.  I have no idea.  We, we watch this and we know every fucking year this happens.  We're just talking about how we feel like this just happened.  You know what?  And we still don't know what the rules are here.  And once again, we're not there.  There's two things we want to do.  We want to go to a Super Bowl and we want to go to a Groundhog Day.  Ah, yes.  And we can't get either one of them done.  Wouldn't that be great if we were in the middle of Gobbler's Knob right now?  Yeah.  Yeah, I thought we suggested maybe we send somebody to, to this whole fucking... 
[00:07:00]  Well, I wouldn't mind sending somebody.  Going myself?  Please.  Why, man?  I bet you it's a pretty good party going on.  Yeah?  Yeah, man.  Is it like, it's probably a whole week worth of parties, like the Super Bowl.  Well, I'm sure it starts today and, yeah, then it carries over to Friday and Saturday  and then everyone has to get the fuck out of town to get to their Super Bowl parties.  Yeah.  That's probably right.  Yeah.  So we got that going on today.  I had no idea. 
[00:07:30]  Which is nice.  Which is nice.  We'll go to the live...  Oh, please.  Of course we will.  The live simulcast soon.  Yeah.  It's in the hour to see what's going on with fucking winter.  This is ridiculous.  We haven't even had much of a winter, so, you know.  Dude, I was on my bike yesterday in Central Park.  That's crazy.  Yesterday was ridiculous, nice weather.  What was it, like 65?  Yeah, no jacket needed.  Low 60s.  Just walking around New York.  It's all nice, but, you know, you got to start believing in global warming yet. 
[00:08:00]  And I'll tell you why.  But last year was abominable.  I'll tell you why.  Because, you know, the people that came before us, you know, like the ice, the ice age?  You know that ice, when it reformed the entire planet?  It was only moving, I think, a foot a year.  Yeah, it was not much at all.  Not even, maybe.  So the people or whatever things were around, never noticed it.  Because it happened so slow around them.  Really slow, yeah.  This weather change, I go, within our lifetime, I remember growing up and having really bad winters every single winter. 
[00:08:30]  Maybe that's just the ones you remember.  And then you fast forward a couple decades, and we're walking around in short sleeves in February.  That's nuts.  I like it.  It's changing too fast, is what I'm saying.  Do you think it is?  I don't know.  Last year was bad.  Last year was fucking cold and snowy.  Last year was certainly bad.  But I think if you did the average, the last five winters, they're milder.  Easily.  But you got to average, like, the last hundred or something, you know?  No, how about we just average the ones in our lifetime? 
[00:09:00]  It's getting scary.  I think we get those.  We went from, yes, we're having a winter, we're having a winter.  Remember those stupid commercials for cold medicine stuff?  And they always show the horrible streets in New York, and people can't even walk.  It's so miserable out.  When was the last time we had that?  I don't know.  Years.  Well, last year.  Maybe last year.  Yeah, last year was bad.  I say maybe because I'm talking about when we were growing up, that type of weather was day after day.  Not just one or two days, and then it went back to, you know.  But here's another deal with that.  Like, technology and the city's infrastructure has gotten better, where they're constantly plowing the streets while the snow's coming down. 
[00:09:30]  So we never really see that huge buildup in the streets, the stuck cars.  You know, unless you go up to Harlem or out to the Bronx, where they don't plow until three days later.  Because, you know, who's really got to get out to work?  Mayor has a tough job there.  Yeah, tough to work.  You know, he only has so many funds, and he's finagling some things. 
[00:10:00]  It's like a video game.  It's like fucking The Sims or something.  Tropico.  It's like Tropico or SimCity.  SimCity.  You know, I'll let those people have the exclamation points over their head going...  Yeah, we can't plow every street, so what do we do here?  You know, we rotate them like we do the pictures in the lobby.  We rotate the streets that we plow or don't plow.  For some reason, the poor neighborhoods.  Maybe we take care of the snow better.  I don't know.  Yeah, I think we absolutely take care of the snow better.  Because I remember, even in suburban Long Island, in some of the nicer areas, even there, the plows didn't come through until the storm was over. 
[00:10:30]  And there was three feet of snow on the roads.  So then it took a lot longer to get rid of the snow?  Now they just plow it and salt them to where, you know, it doesn't even build up on the streets a lot of times.  Were you an ice skater growing up?  No.  We were ice skaters.  Really?  Yeah, because it, you know, got us out of the house.  So our parents would just drop us off in these, like, ponds and shit around Long Island.  Ponds?  You were ice skating? 
[00:11:00]  Thank you.  Really?  You just made my point.  Yeah.  See, you don't even have a memory of that.  When I was growing up, it was very normal on the weekend, especially in the winter.  My parents would drop us off at a pond, and there were hundreds of kids there, and we  all would just skate around for a couple hours, and they'd come and pick us up.  Would you grow up?  A Dickens novel?  What the fuck are you doing?  What?  I'm saying.  I don't remember the last time I saw a pond even frozen.  Yeah, that's true.  People are always falling through whatever thin ice does get on there every year. 
[00:11:30]  Yeah, you know.  I do remember when we were growing up, we lost one around Mildam, that Mildam pond.  Somebody fell through.  Oh, yeah.  We lost them, too.  I remember a kid doing that, too.  In the sump.  It was in one of the sumps.  Really?  It was slightly frozen over, and some kids decided, you know, they're going to walk out  on the ice, and some chubby kid fell through.  Really?  And, boy, they had to make the announcements.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah, we lost one, too.  It was my brother's grade.  I didn't know the kid.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Death came early.  Ah, boy.  You know, you don't want to have to deal with it. 
[00:12:00]  Death until you're a little older.  Oh, wow.  Man, when you're in, like, grammar school, and that Death comes early, that is some creepy  shit.  Yeah, now the parents, you know the parents are like, fuck, man, I didn't want to have  to deal with this shit until he got a little older, but...  We were living a horror movie.  I told the story, Washington Drive School, we're all, I don't know, fourth grade, fifth  grade, and the beloved principal, I mean, he was beloved.  Mr. Leone, or Mr. Leone, or something like that. 
[00:12:30]  It's been a long time since I've thought about his name.  But he went scuba diving out there in Waiting River.  Uh-oh.  And he had a problem, and he died.  And now we're walking through Washington Drive School.  It was so fucking creepy, because we lost our beloved principal.  Yeah.  The kids were fucking, it was a horror show.  But did they?  No one can be consoled.  I mean, no one.  Back then, they didn't have the grief counselors, either.  No!  So it was probably the gym teacher going, all right, kids, the president's not the 
[00:13:00]  president.  You're a fucking little asshole.  The principal's dead.  Right, right, right.  I suck.  Right.  The principal's dead.  Yeah, no.  That's all right.  It was a good idea.  But he had a scuba diving accident in Waiting River out there in Long Island.  Yeah.  And we all got the calls at home, like, on a Sunday night, I think.  And we still had to go to school on Monday.  And like you said, there were no grief counselors.  And we're just little kids trying to figure out what the fuck is going on still.  Yeah. 
[00:13:30]  And now we're thrown this death thing at an early age.  That is a bitch.  Holy fuck, it was bad.  And then just the hallways were empty.  All depressing.  Yeah, because he really was one of those guys.  He just worked the school constantly.  Yeah, he was a good principal.  Those hands-on principals.  Ooh.  One of the ones that everyone liked, you know?  I mean, everyone.  So.  I never trust those people, to tell you the truth.  Principals and teachers that are too, you know.  Who knows? 
[00:14:00]  They're in the hallway going, okay, come on now, get to class, pat him on the ass, you  know, a little, oh, and everyone loves him.  Why can't the principal.  I don't know what's going on in there.  He should be hated and despised.  Despised.  Why can't he just be beloved without it leading to kid-touching?  Why?  Why does everything have to lead to kid-touching?  All roads lead to kid-touching.  Yeah, it's just a natural progression.  No, it's not a natural progression.  It's so natural.  Romney fucked up overnight, huh?  Well, you know.  Limbaugh's on his case, I noticed. 
[00:14:30]  He did fuck up, but it's truly the left media that's really taking him out of context.  Well, no, Limbaugh was all about it, too.  Well, Limbaugh is a newt guy, though.  He really is pushing for newt.  Yeah, so he's going to bash Romney, but...  This is where I stand.  He's an idiot for saying...  Yeah, I'm not a big fan of Romney, but I don't think it's a huge fuck up.  I really don't.  I understand what he was saying in the clip.  But how things work today, they're going to take that one part, and they're going to crucify him for the next few days. 
[00:15:00]  He said, I'm not concerned about the very poor, and that's the clip they're using.  Right, that sounds horrible.  That sounds, you know, wow, you fucking guy's not concerned about the very poor in this country.  And you take it out of context, like, of course, the media does.  Yeah.  That's going to be a rough one.  But he said he's also not concerned about the rich, because they're doing fine, and he's not concerned about the very poor, because there are things in place...  Safety nets.  Safety nets, as he called them, that will take care of them, so they're not, you know, they're not just in the streets dying, for the most part. 
[00:15:30]  Right.  What he wants to concentrate on is building the country up through the middle class.  And the majority of the country who are working people that are, you know, maybe homeowners, struggling, have some kids.  They're contributing to society, and that's what he's concentrating on.  But the way he made it sound is, you know, ah, well, let's throw away these poor.  I have no use for them.  And that's kind of the way they're spinning it.  He's not smart.  I mean...  No, that's a dumb thing to say, the way he said it. 
[00:16:00]  He just handed the Obama camp a fucking golden nugget, man.  A golden ticket, because they're going to be playing this in an ad when the time comes.  Who's his vice president?  He doesn't even know.  He can't pick Newt.  And Santorum is still a kid.  I think he should take Ron Paul.  He's not going to take Ron Paul.  I'm telling you, what that does is that would pull Obama voters.  No one else in the Republican Party has any shot at getting an Obama vote. 
[00:16:30]  Yeah, but Ron...  Ron Paul does.  He would not do it, though.  He's not...  It's not even a...  I bet you it's not even an open for discussion.  I bet it's not even on the short list or the long list.  What is that, though?  Because he comes across...  He comes off like a nut.  He comes off like a fucking crazy person to the majority of the country.  His constituency seems to be...  Well, the people that love him, love him, man.  Big time.  Like hippie types.  Right.  The people that love smoking weed. 
[00:17:00]  They love the idea...  They love the idea of not even less government, no government.  Right.  Which a lot of these people would be suffering and crying if they actually literally got  no government.  So he just...  He's not mainstream enough for this country.  Then who does he take?  I think he's just going to pull someone out of his ass.  I don't think...  It can't be Santorum.  Santorum's still green, like I said.  Newt Gingrich is too erratic.  I still don't put Christy out of it.  I think Christy is up... 
[00:17:30]  Might go with Christy.  Or just somebody.  Although he's obese.  I'm telling you, have you ever seen an unfit...  Like in our lifetime, a fat president or fat...  Not in our lifetime.  No, it's a weird...  Unfortunately.  I feel like a fat president like Taft.  I bet you Christy's on some kind of short list if he has that already.  Definitely.  And I bet you it's other people that obviously weren't part of this whole process.  Condoleezza Rice, I forgot her name mentioned.  I mean, who was dropped out?  He's a black woman.  He would never take Rick Perry.  John Huntsman.  I kind of like John Huntsman a little bit. 
[00:18:00]  John Huntsman.  But he's out of it.  Herman Cain.  He can't take Herman Cain.  But Condoleezza Rice also has a tremendous resume.  I mean, she was Secretary of State under Bush.  I mean...  It's going to be someone that's really not in the spotlight like the rest of these guys.  She's got that Bush baggage, though, man.  She's got that whole thing with...  You know, they would use the Iraq thing, the whole thing with going in under false pretense.  You know...  She was really good, though, at... 
[00:18:30]  When you heard her speak...  She's smart.  Yeah.  And she was really good at defending those policies.  Like, she was very unapologetic about the apologies.  People would twist those around as saying she was very good at lying and not being honest with herself.  Because the book she put out about Bush and Cheney and her time spent with them pretty much said...  I didn't agree with a lot of stuff.  I said things that I didn't want to say.  You know, she's a good soldier. 
[00:19:00]  But I think when that shit comes out, it could be really twisted around like she wasn't honest.  Maybe.  I'm not sure, you know.  But it seems that you'd give the Democrats a lot of ammo.  Right.  What about Michael Rubio?  How about Michael Bublé?  Michael Rubio from Florida.  Ah, isn't he...  Yeah, yeah.  What about the Michael Rubio?  They've been knocking his name around.  Yeah, I've heard it mentioned a few times.  Meh.  Meh.  You want to hear about another principal dying? 
[00:19:30]  What?  Yeah, man.  When death comes early, it's not easy to deal with.  Dave in New York.  What's up, guys?  Amen.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Hi, buddy.  Thank you.  Hey, I went up to school when I grew up in Tarrytown in Sleepy Hollow.  And when I was in the seventh...  Boo!  Is it Mike Rubio or Marco Rubio, by the way?  Marco Rubio.  It is.  I'm sorry.  I just realized I made that mistake.  All right, go ahead, Dave.  What?  So, I was in the seventh grade twice.  Ah, stupid. 
[00:20:00]  You were in the seventh grade twice.  You dummy.  Hey, stupid.  Dumb, dumb lunkhead.  Hey, stupid.  Oh, God.  The entirety of it is...  Hey, wait a minute.  Hold on.  Hey.  Hold on.  Hold on.  We're doing bits here.  Hey, where...  Hold on.  Dude.  Where are you from?  Tarrytown.  Where?  Sleepy Hollow.  All right, go ahead. 
[00:20:30]  Yeah, where's your head?  You think they're sick of that headless horse?  Oh, are they ever?  All it was was a headless horse, but our football team was a headless horse.  Of course.  Of course.  Wherever you go, I'm sure the specials at the diner have something to do with it.  That's it.  I'm sure that dumb logo's everywhere.  Oh, yeah.  So, I was the one to do...  Why?  Why?  We got a few things to do here, sir.  Why seventh grade twice?  Well, because I had a lot of shit going on in Evan back then. 
[00:21:00]  The horse was running through my house.  I'm scared.  I'm scared of you.  I'm scared.  Like, um...  Okay, sir.  Seventh grade twice, why?  You had a lot of shit going on?  Yeah, seventh grade twice, you know, a lot of shit going on growing up.  You know, one parent. 
[00:21:30]  It was rough.  Let me ask you this, because I always wondered about the kids that got left back.  What do you do for a living now?  I'm a teacher, actually.  That's funny.  That is perfect.  I love Dave.  All right, Dave.  What do you got, buddy?  So, anyway, seventh grade...  Yes, sir.  Go ahead, Evan.  Yes, sir.  Because, you know, I was one of the struggling kids. 
[00:22:00]  This principal was always helping me out and stuff.  Well, according to Jimmy, that means he was touching you.  I didn't say that.  No, I did.  I'm just following the flow chart.  That was Anthony's observation.  Yes.  I just, I concurred.  Yeah, okay.  I concurred with the molestation.  I'm just going back to the old bit where the flow chart leads always to kid touching.  Molestation.  So you need a little extra help.  That means he was touching your fan.  A little extra help in your underwear.  Right.  Fortunately for me, my hiney was left untouched.  Aw.  Wow, you were dumb.  And you had a badass. 
[00:22:30]  Yeah, you were the dummy.  Sorry.  Go ahead.  So, it was the summer of, like, 85, 86.  Was it?  Yeah.  What does that have to do with anything?  Well, I'm just going back in time a little bit.  And so...  It's reflecting.  You're going to find out, halfway through the summer, he and his wife and his two children  had a horrible crime accident over in Rockland County, I think.  And, uh, they ended up under the truck, all four of them died. 
[00:23:00]  Car accident.  Did the headless horse run across the fucking highway?  That's what happened.  I just assume everyone dies because of the headless horse.  Is the horse headless or the headless horseman?  Oh, the guy's headless.  The headless horse.  The headless horse.  The headless horse.  I know where his ass is. 
[00:23:30]  The headless horseman.  The horseman.  The headless horse.  The headless horse.  The headless horse.  It's what waltz, waltz his horse.  Where would you put the reins in?  It would just keep slipping off.  Every time he whinnies, they'd fall off.  The headless horse.  The guy's riding it like, what the fuck is going on?  I hate this.  So, you lost the principal and his entire family.  That's similar to what happened to me.  That shit's scary, man.  It was sad.  It was a bad year that year.  Did I ever talk about... 
[00:24:00]  They're in Sleepy Hollow.  I think it might have been Ms. McCutcheon.  Oh.  Or was it Mrs.  Maybe someone from Washington Drive could confirm this.  Did you say McCutcheon?  McCutcheon, I believe.  These are names I haven't thought about in years.  Summer break.  It happened during the summer, yeah.  The family's name was Hirsch.  Mr. Hirsch.  I thought...  All right.  Thank you, sir.  I hope he was telling a story.  Thanks, guys.  Have a great day.  Thanks, guys.  He's still a dummy.  Another death came early.  Ah.  Mrs. McCutcheon.  She was beloved, too. 
[00:24:30]  She was my second grade teacher.  Death comes calling.  But I think this happened a few years after I was gone from Washington Drive.  I'm not sure, but we got the news that Ms. or Mrs. McCutcheon was up there in Canada  enjoying the winter break or whatever.  That sounds nice.  Might have been summer.  Yeah, sounds nice, too.  And she's in a car, a rental, and all of a sudden she comes around a corner, and there's  a guy flying in his car, his truck, with his plow-up. 
[00:25:00]  Oh.  Oh, no.  And supposedly, we were told, maybe something got lost in the translation, that she was  beheaded.  Ow!  She was beheaded.  Wow.  She lived most of her life, though.  Without a head?  Well, she seemed to be older.  Oh.  But I was a little thing, so maybe she was only 40. 
[00:25:30]  Yeah, that sounds ancient.  But how I remember it, she was a bit older to begin with.  This break is macabre.  And I don't know if that's true.  Yeah.  But that's, you know, that's what was told.  Eh.  By the time it was told to me, she was beheaded.  Now it's small town legend, so it might as well be true.  Yeah.  Do you know when you said McCutcheon?  I think it's McCutcheon.  You reminded me of an awful joke that I did.  Oh, back in the good old days?  Yeah.  Was it the obese primate days? 
[00:26:00]  No, it made obese primates look like fucking, like Pryor's fucking monkey running up the  arm, putting his dick in my ear bit.  It was, uh, do you know the town of Metuchin, New Jersey?  Yes.  Oh, boy.  Strap in, kids.  Did I ever, uh, did I ever tell you this one?  I don't think so.  Not Metuchin' My Balls.  It was close to that, yeah.  It was, uh.  I've heard that over the years.  Let's hear it with the inimitable delivery.  It sounds like, uh, it sounds like something Elvis would say, I'm a-touchin' myself. 
[00:26:30]  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  No.  Yeah.  You didn't do that.  I did.  Oh.  Oh.  I did.  And you added in the, uh-huh.  Oh, of course, because it was Elvis.  Of course it was.  It was pretty good.  Yeah.  Oof.  Oh, wow.  Metuchin'.  Metuchin' myself.  Uh-huh.  Did it get a laugh? 
[00:27:00]  I don't think so.  No.  It got a laugh today.  Yeah.  We laughed.  Not with me.  Laughing at you.  You know.  It's not nice.  Just when I was, um, putting myself out there defending principles as far as touching kids,  we got a, uh, a kid-touching story.  Oh.  And it's a death story.  Oh, good.  All wrapped up into one.  Well, let me get my dick out.  Yeah.  Towtale.  Derek of Long Island.  Hey, how you guys doing?  Um, Opie, I grew up in Huntington.  Couldn't even wait for an answer.  Yeah.  Probably not far from, uh, where you grew up. 
[00:27:30]  I went to-  Well, uh, well, let's break this down a little bit.  Uh-huh.  I was in the little town of Centiport, Long Island, which is part of the Huntington Township.  The Township.  Where did you live?  I lived in, in Huntington Village.  Oh.  Toidy and toidy.  Hold on.  How close to FH Riley's, my brother's restaurant, which is on, uh, I believe, uh, New York Avenue.  400 New York Avenue.  Pretty much the heart of Huntington Village.  How close to that place?  Try the mac and cheese.  Dude, the mac and cheese, I'm still fucking shitting that out from Sunday. 
[00:28:00]  What an endorsement.  That mac and cheese is ridiculously good.  That mac and cheese-  If you don't give a shit about what you look like, go to FH Riley's and order the mac and  cheese.  You'll-  You'll thank me later.  Oh.  I didn't say it, but I looked that way.  I've had the mac and cheese.  I don't know.  That was it.  How ridiculous is that?  Looks like you have it in your hair.  The mac and cheese is great.  Your colon's gonna hold that until Obama's out of office.  It's just gonna stay there.  What's that?  Your phone broke up. 
[00:28:30]  Anyway-  What'd you say, sir?  Yeah, we didn't hear the mac and cheese joke.  Something about Obama.  Something, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, I know.  Okay.  It's almost as funny when they know.  How close to FH Riley's did you grow up?  I grew up very, very close to FH Riley's.  I probably-  In fact, I worked at a record store in Huntington, and I'm sure Anthony came in with his RotGut  CDs, probably waved for me back in the day.  What record store?  The one on New York Avenue? 
[00:29:00]  Yeah, the one on New York Avenue, Soundtracks.  I had worked there.  Soundtracks fucking closed.  Yeah, they did.  Another mom-and-pop fucking music store closed.  I thought those places would at least survive it.  Yeah, well-  But they went out of business.  No, the fancy little boutiques around Huntington-  I like that place because-  Taken out by the big boys.  I like that place because they had the good stuff.  The vinyl, the-  No, they had the good stuff.  The illegals.  Oh, the bootlegs?  The good bootlegs.  I like how you're whispering like they're gonna still get in trouble.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:29:30]  You never know.  You never know, though.  Let me tell you what they are.  Yeah, we're calling the authorities right now.  When I was into my Nirvana and stuff, I would dig through, and I found some stuff, man, at that place.  But anyway, go ahead.  All right, so we all have a connection.  That's good, Canal.  All right, so anyway, this guy, South Down School, this principal, I was, you know, elementary school.  I remember walking down the hall, and the principal just grabbed my shirt, threw me to the floor for no fucking reason. 
[00:30:00]  A couple of times, just walking down the hall, you know, going to lunch or whatever.  And he just walks by, he'd walk by these kids, and he'd just stick his finger in their chest for no reason.  The guy was a douchebag.  Chicks?  I didn't see him do it to any girls.  He did it to most of the guys.  I'd use two fingers instead of one in the middle.  Two, one on each nipple.  One on each budding little nub.  Each curious breast.  You know, it was a different time.  You know, back then, growing up, we were, that's what's wrong with kids today. 
[00:30:30]  You could fuck a kid back then.  What?  Isn't that what you were getting at?  Teacher molested?  Yeah, you could fuck with them.  And the principal or the teachers, they would never get in trouble, because we were raised to fear authority.  And that's why we all ended up fucked up, as we did, I guess.  So anyway, this guy, he was a real boring story.  The story just goes on and on.  You're fucking pontificating.  He died of cancer.  I couldn't be happier.  Okay, at least it ended funny. 
[00:31:00]  It ended funny.  Cancer's funny, and he died of cancer.  Just because he poked you in the chest a little too hard.  Oh, well, he threw me to the floor.  That was the good one.  I enjoyed that.  Yeah, it was good.  School days, school days.  Dear old golden rule days.  Sounds wonderful.  All right, sir, thank you.  All right.  Lovely story.  Thank you for the FH Riley's plug.  It's a terrific place.  Hey, we got the Mitt Romney clip.  We're all over the place, boy.  It's all coming over.  I like that.  We're zigging and zagging. 
[00:31:30]  We're serpentining through this break.  So you're going to hear this clip a million fucking times today.  I'm not concerned about the very poor.  But here's the whole clip.  But the media will just take that part.  Yeah.  And crucify the guy.  By the way, I'm in this race because I care about Americans.  The white race?  I'm not concerned about the very poor.  We have a safety net there.  If it needs a repair, I'll fix it.  All right.  I know I said last question, but I've got to ask you.  You just said, I'm not concerned about the very poor because they have a safety net.  And I think there are lots of very poor Americans who are struggling who would say, 
[00:32:00]  that sounds odd.  Finish the sentence, says Soledad.  I said, I'm not concerned about the very poor that have a safety net.  But if it has holes in it, I will repair them.  Got it.  Okay.  The challenge right now, we will hear from the Democratic Party the plight of the poor.  And there's no question, it's not good being poor.  And we have a safety net to help those that are very poor.  But my campaign is focused on middle-income Americans.  My campaign, you can choose where to focus.  You can focus on the rich. 
[00:32:30]  That's not my focus.  You can focus on the very poor.  That's not my focus.  My focus is on middle-income Americans.  Terrible fucking clip for him.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  What a terrible, even though I know what he's saying.  You're right.  It opens him up.  And she's a cunt.  Yeah, you've got to be smarter.  You've just got to be smarter.  Because she didn't quote him accurately.  Right, right.  And good for him to call him out.  Finish the sentence, Soledad, or whatever her name was.  Soledad O'Brien.  Yeah, but they're going to play just that one part over and over again.  But even hearing the rest of the clip, it's like, ugh.  I'll say it today, man.  I don't see Obama losing this fucking thing right now. 
[00:33:00]  Sorry.  I don't see him losing this.  But then again, the very poor wouldn't have voted for Mitt Romney anyway.  That's not his base.  So it's like, is he losing anybody by saying that?  Probably not.  No, I know.  Middle class are the ones he probably wants to pull from Obama.  So that's probably the ones he's appealing to.  As we sit here today, I don't see Obama losing this fucking thing.  Really?  Yeah.  I don't know.  When a guy that rich says that, it's like, you know, you don't want to hear that shit.  It really comes off poorly.  You don't want to hear that shit.  You can never go wrong when you say that you really want to help poor people. 
[00:33:30]  Yeah, why would you just, yeah, just don't even acknowledge it.  Why would you do that?  Well, maybe he's thinking there's a large segment of this society that has been overlooked as the productive members of this society in lieu of them paying so much attention to the poor and the downtrodden in this country.  It seems like a cheap, easy way over the years to get votes and look like you're a hero and you're this moral guy. 
[00:34:00]  And he's just saying, look, here's a shitload of fucking people, potential voters that I want to address and I will be representing instead of just, you know, again, being this president that goes, we must help the poor.  I see what he's doing here, but he really could have worded that a little better.  I see what he's saying there, too, but he just wasn't smart about it.  You don't see a lot of, it's hard to say that because you don't see a lot of rich people's kids coming back from Iraq. 
[00:34:30]  I'm not saying that they don't go or they don't ever serve, but it's stupid to say something like that when a lot of the fucking grunt work in this country is done by people that don't make a lot of money.  Yeah, yeah.  But the fucking military thing we have, we are so proud of our military.  Very, very, very few of them on a non-officer level are fucking not.  But he didn't say people that are not, he didn't say people that are getting along, people that, he said the very poor, which, again, can be twisted around. 
[00:35:00]  But I think he honestly means people that are out of work, on welfare, food stamps, things like that.  He said the very poor, his campaign isn't going to just concentrate on that.  But what it sounds like, and I know that they take it out of context.  Yeah, yeah.  But when you say they got a safety net, if there's a hole, I'll fix it.  What that sounds like is that's where they are, that's where they're going to stay, and if there's a hole in their net, I'll fix it to make sure they don't fall any further. 
[00:35:30]  But I don't see any holes right now.  That sounded terrible for me.  It did sound terrible.  Well, I agree.  Dumb motherfucker.  I agree.  Rush is absolutely going after him, even.  But like Ant said, I guess Rush is a Newt guy.  I think Rush is a Newt guy.  He really wants to help Newt get him.  Well, Romney, he sees as a...  But that's dumb from Rush, because Newt has no shot at getting the nomination.  None.  Newt's crazy.  Romney's going to be the guy, it looks like.  Doesn't Newt seem like a fucking, a little kid that just doesn't know it's time to leave the party? 
[00:36:00]  Yeah.  Like, I found him hateable way back when, and I find him hateable now.  That is true.  I know he's not a dumb guy.  The guy that won't leave the party.  Yeah, he's the fucking fat douchebag that's not getting his own way.  Although it's looking really good for Romney, I feel it's still just slightly too early for him to leave, though.  Why not do a couple more weeks?  Why not?  The sun's coming up, there's beer bottles all around the house, and everyone else is gone, and he's going,  Put on Animal House!  God, could you go home?  I want to go to sleep.  But aren't you that guy usually? 
[00:36:30]  No, I'm throwing the party.  See, I've changed.  I throw the parties now.  I follow your Twitter enough to know that you're outlasting every single person in your house.  Yeah, usually.  But my Twitters are very misleading, because a lot of times I'm sleeping, and then I wake up, and I'm able to stay up late,  because people go, When do you sleep?  It's like when you don't see me tweeting, I'm sleeping.  Right.  Sometimes that's a long clip.  All right, we go back to kid touching.  All right, all roads. 
[00:37:00]  I would love to think this is a real call, but I have a feeling this is an exaggeration.  Go ahead, Chris.  Hey, what's up, fellas?  Hey, man.  Hello.  Dude, this is totally real.  Okay, go ahead.  Should I say the town or no?  It's on the line.  Why not?  Yeah, just say the town name.  West Hampstead.  All right, I don't want any further.  Actually, don't say any names.  No, of course not.  Yeah.  Just ethnicity.  Go.  Yeah.  So this is actually kind of a pathetic story, so Jimmy will appreciate it. 
[00:37:30]  Yes.  I was in seventh grade.  It was like the height of grunge rock.  And my, like, home ec teacher, you know, girl teacher was a fat pig.  And she made me come after school early.  Come.  Come after school to work on my pillow that I was knitting.  Yeah, fruit.  Wait, it was a fat pig teacher?  Fat pig, fat pig.  Was she hot?  Fat pig, fat pig.  Was she hot? 
[00:38:00]  Well, sometimes, you know, if she has youth on her side, the fat isn't as bad.  She was busty.  See?  All right, now we're talking.  All right.  Would she show off the cleavage a little bit?  No, she wore moo-moos.  Her slovenly tits.  Oh, she must have been huge if she's wearing moo-moos.  Fucking fat lady dress.  The only one that could wear those was Mrs. Roper.  Yeah, Audra Lindley.  Who didn't want a sticker?  Moo-moo.  A-bwa-bwa-bwa-bwa-bwa-bwa-bwa-bwa-bwa-bwa-bwa-bwa-bwa-bwa.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Are we... 
[00:38:30]  Ha, ha, ha, there it is.  I almost yelled at Eric as a joke to not have the Roper Steve queued up.  Da, da, da.  Your story will be right there, sir.  God, this is so bad.  Do you know how much they hate this?  And now it's going to be stuck in my head again.  Ah, look, he's got the plunger, and he's dancing around.  And then Jeffrey Camber's wife comes in.  Oh, and he shoves the plunger up her ass.  And he throws plates at her.  Mr. So's did it again. 
[00:39:00]  All right.  All right.  All right.  So she wore moo-moos, but she was busty.  Yeah, I'm still here.  And she made you, what did she teach again?  Like, they called it Home and Careers, which is basically.  Home and Careers.  Just Home Ec.  Stop naming new names for the same old shite.  Wasn't it Home Ec, right?  Yeah, okay.  Home Economics.  So, yeah, so I had a black satin pillow, and in the middle of it, it said Nirvana. 
[00:39:30]  And around the outside, I put the names in different colors.  And she made me come and work on it.  Let's be honest, though.  You made Chris Novoselic, his name's slightly smaller, right?  On the back of the pillow.  Yeah.  But Dave Grohl and Kurt, you made sure people saw those names.  No, he misheard me do the songs.  The band members, I was too young to appreciate the band members.  Oh.  Oh, just songs?  What songs did you pick? 
[00:40:00]  Teen Spirit?  Polly.  Huh?  I remember Polly was too big for, it was so much bigger than the rest of the songs.  It was in orange.  And it smelled like Teen Spirit.  And then on a plane.  And then dumb.  I fucking sucked.  Oh, God.  All right.  And now, and now I'm a teacher to make fun of other kids that suck that were like me.  Sure.  So, she put the pillows in this big trunk.  And us little guys, you really had to, like, really get up and bend over and get it. 
[00:40:30]  And she came up behind me to act like she was helping me get the pillow.  And she was, like, rubbing her big, fat, mushy fucking thing under her belly.  That little pot under her belly.  Yeah, the bunt.  The bunt?  Yeah, the bunt.  Right against my fucking ass.  And then in class, and she was so heavy, and the class was narrow like a shoebox.  She'd walk behind my seat and rub her fat tits on the back of my head.  And I actually appreciated it.  I was 7th grade.  I was jerking off like a monkey. 
[00:41:00]  Yeah.  But I appreciated it.  And then I went to the principal, and I'm like, look, you know, this is happening.  It kind of makes you feel uncomfortable.  She makes me come out of the school, like, three times a week, and I'm totally done with the project.  And he's like, listen, he's like, sometimes your kids tend to exaggerate things, so I say just suck it up.  Suck it up.  Suck it up.  You know what, though?  We all heard suck it up when we were growing up.  Yeah.  Suck it up, walk it off.  Walk it off, suck it up. 
[00:41:30]  What a tattletale.  Deal with it.  But did she ever touch your genitals?  Did she fondle them?  She did, like, reach around me to help me get my pillow, my satin black.  Enough about the pillow.  Dumbass pillow.  Enough about the pillow.  What song are they singing, by the way, on, uh, do we have the pucks that they're singing a song?  Oh, wow.  Can we pot that up?  Yeah, they are.  No, we can't.  Why can't we?  He has to change the channel to one of these, and he gets all confused. 
[00:42:00]  Why don't we have constant live coverage?  Isn't there somewhere that is playing just the live coverage from Gobbler's Knob?  I'll go back, because now it's too late again.  We need the main channel up over there.  Whatever the channel is that you can just hit the button to, that's the one that should  be on.  Oh, fuck.  I'm getting pulled over.  Son of a bitch.  Oh, wait.  Hold on.  Don't get off the phone.  Put it in your lap or something.  Hide it.  Let's hear it.  This is great radio.  We love when this happens.  All right.  I'm on straight path.  Should I stop or no?  Oh, shit.  You're getting pulled over on straight path?  Is it a real cop? 
[00:42:30]  What do you need today?  Oh, fuck.  Oh, fuck.  All right.  Hang on a minute.  Oh, God.  Why are you getting pulled over on straight path?  That's like...  Hope the cop shoots him.  That used to be a drug area, right?  It's not nice, Anthony.  I'm a fucking low down.  Straight path?  Fuck yeah.  Are you in the white section or the black section of straight path?  Where's the white section?  It gets white near the end.  Yeah.  Each end of it, it gets a little whiter.  Near what?  Deer Park Avenue, right?  It gets a little white?  I'm moving towards Deer Park Avenue.  All right.  Hang on.  Are you near the train station?  God, I used to drive that road all the time.  Coming back from BAB. 
[00:43:00]  What are they saying?  I think he's rapping.  I think he's rapping.  Oh.  Oh, man.  Yeah.  I'm on the cell phone.  Oh, did they get him for a cell phone?  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Don't know.  Oh.  That hurt.  Used to get me out of tickets all the time.  We're not popular anymore.  Cops used to always call us.  I think he told them to shut it off.  Yeah.  Ah, he's getting a ticket for fucking being on a cell phone. 
[00:43:30]  Driving down straight path?  Come on, man.  Oh, man.  That's scary enough.  Hi, it's the Opie and Anthony show.  Oh, well.  Well.  Ah, well.  Hopefully he's being tased as we speak.  How great would that be?  Oh, it'd be fantastic.  Wish we were live for that.  On the cell phone?  That's a bad one to get.  Cell phone?  I mean, it's just because it's so unnecessary to get it. 
[00:44:00]  You realize how easy it is to drive with a cell phone to your ear after texting and driving?  Yeah.  You're like, oh, come on.  It's a breeze.  That's easy.  We could all do that.  Yeah, punch in a few numbers.  That texting gets a little rough, man.  Holy fuck.  You just can't do it.  Siri can be helpful, though.  Yeah.  Siri, if it's working, if it's quiet, you can talk and it's actually not bad.  Yeah.  As soon as Sam Roberts had to hear.  Oh.  Sam Roberts. 
[00:44:30]  What do you got, Sam Roberts?  Oh, this is, is this live coverage?  Because I believe the guy with the top hat was rapping.  Oh.  That's what he's doing.  They're entertaining everyone?  They're entertaining no one.  I don't know.  That shout song gets people going.  It's a terrible song.  Are they all going to jump on the ground at the end, do you think?  Holy shit.  It's Otis Day and the Nights.  That was another one of my awful fucking jokes for years.  What?  Something about when you try to have sex and you can't.  It's like that song, shout, a little bit softer now, a little bit softer now. 
[00:45:00]  I don't remember how I would do it.  Why would you sing that?  Because I was like saying my penis wouldn't get hard.  Oh.  A little bit softer now.  Wow.  It was really bad.  It's a miracle I'm still in this business.  Stump.  Aren't they supposed to be on their backs at this point, Ant?  Where's the part where you go on your back and look like a...  A few of them are enjoying this. 
[00:45:30]  Dumb song.  This is from Punxsutawney.  Yeah.  Not a Negro to be found.  I've never wanted to hear Allah Akbar so bad in my life.  Fucking Punxsutawney.  I despise them.  Who are the chicks in the background?  Looked like some local high school girls.  Yeah, they're probably a bunch of like Punxsutawney Phil girlfriends or something.  Ah, well, whatever, Chip.  If you need a little knowledge about this place, a lot of colleges in the area.  Oh, are there?  Yeah, so it's a big party, man. 
[00:46:00]  Wow, look at all those people.  A lot of colleges.  It's like Woodstock or something.  Yeah.  We should break.  So that's the Mid-Romney clip.  Oh, right.  We got food.  Got Rich Voss coming in today.  We got Dr. Steve's best man speech today.  I hear that.  We got Mars calling another radio station, I guess, to talk about his first gay experience.  Yeah, you called in some show.  Should we play that now, maybe?  That's fantastic.  Yeah, I was listening to the radio and he called in a show called Cock Talk.  Cock Talk?  Yeah.  That's fantastic.  Are they going to the Super Bowl?  Is Cock Talk? 
[00:46:30]  Yeah.  Yeah?  They were in Indiana when he called in.  Look, we don't have to do this.  I'm just asking, do you have a Super Bowl update today?  Because I love the Super Bowl updates.  And we only have two more live shows before the Super Bowl.  I could poke around and see if there's any more information.  I did hear chatter.  Chatter?  Sweetie.  Oh, I'm sick!  God damn it!  No!  Take care of yourself.  The first sneeze.  Shit.  Yes, you've heard chatter.  Super Bowl Talk will be taking place tomorrow and Saturday at Bananas in Poughkeepsie. 
[00:47:00]  Oh!  Where I'll be warming up for my special.  Fantastic.  Yes.  Go.  Go see.  And Bailey J is a confirmed attendee.  Wow.  Really?  In one of the shows, yes.  Hotness with a cock.  Well, you know.  The lovely Bailey J.  Really?  Yeah, she lives up there.  You want to find out if that guy got a ticket or not?  Oh, is he?  Yeah.  Hey, Chris.  You're back on the phone.  Thank God.  We were very concerned.  Yes.  Very concerned.  You think I'm fucking bullshitting, are you? 
[00:47:30]  No.  No, we heard the panic.  So we need to know, did you or did you not get a ticket just now?  It's pretty fast.  Oh.  Give some fuck.  I hope he's back on the phone driving and the same cop pulls him over.  Wait a minute.  I just gave you a break.  What are you doing?  You fucking asshole.  Bridesmaids is very funny, by the way.  You liked it.  I did.  Yeah.  Do you think it's Academy Award material?  Absolutely not.  That is one of the most ridiculous fucking things. 
[00:48:00]  What are you talking about?  Bridesmaids.  It's nominated?  Yeah.  No.  Is it nominated for Best Picture?  No.  Best Screenplay.  And the Fat Chick.  And Supporting Actress.  The Fat Chick was amazing.  She was very funny.  Not Oscar.  Not Oscar.  She was not Oscar.  She saved the fucking movie.  I liked the movie.  Yeah.  I'm going to watch it again because I didn't understand the hype.  But too many people are liking this movie.  I got to watch it again.  I'll tell you what the hype I think was.  Is that they finally used some honest language.  And there was a couple of really funny quote unquote guy type scenes in a girl movie. 
[00:48:30]  Which was funny.  I mean Kristen Wiig was good.  And what I liked about it is that none of them were really that attractive except the  really one hot one.  Yeah.  The girl getting married was mopey looking.  Kristen Wiig's okay.  The fat one's not hot.  That was Rudolph, right?  Getting married.  Oh, is that my Rudolph?  Yeah.  It was none of them were that fucking smoking hot.  So I kind of liked the fact that it wasn't that.  The best scene in the movie is Kristen Wiig and that little girl going at it.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:49:00]  And then the story.  Have you seen that they released a really long version of that scene that goes on for  I think eight to nine minutes.  Obviously, they can't use that in the movie.  It's fucking hilarious.  I thought you know the scene, right?  Yeah.  With the little girl.  A couple of the scenes were a little like they did the same like when she's driving by  the cop car, they probably could have showed that two or three times instead of six.  Yeah.  Like there was a couple of things in that I would have done differently.  Little girl.  That chick is smoking fucking hot.  Well, I mean, I think she plays like a 15 year old in the movie. 
[00:49:30]  That chick is smoking fucking hot.  It's 10 minutes long.  Smoking fucking hot.  I don't have a problem.  Oh, pause.  No.  We've done this break already, Ant.  She's not smoking hot.  She's wearing that type of hat because she has a massive forehead.  Gives a shit.  All the better to come on.  No, there's nothing worse than a giant forehead girl.  Yeah.  Yeah, especially when they're pretty up front and then they throw their head back whimsically.  And I go, boy, look at that hairline.  It's like sonar in there. 
[00:50:00]  Yeah.  Fucking boo.  Hey, a hammerhead shark beater.  Want to play a little of this going on the break?  It's tacky.  It's not tacky.  Yes.  What are you saying?  I have bad taste?  Obviously.  What is that supposed to mean?  Well, you're tacky.  Okay, then I guess I'm tacky.  Tacky.  Okay, well, I think you're acting like a single brat.  What did you say?  I said, I think you are a spoiled little brat.  Well, you're stupid.  Okay, well, at least I'm not stupid and dumb. 
[00:50:30]  If you can't come up with a comeback, better than that, you're obviously stupid and dumb.  You're stupid.  You're fat.  Have you called Jenny Craig yet?  Looks like you're pregnant.  Baby bump.  I'm not pregnant.  Alert.  I'm not.  You've even been alert.  You're going to have an eating disorder.  You're going to be bulimic and your teeth are going to fall out.  Did you forget to take your Xanax this morning?  I'm on Xanax because I don't need it.  What, do you overdose or something?  No, I don't overdose.  If I did, I'd be dead.  Well, nobody would care if you were.  You don't even know that.  I have tons of family. 
[00:51:00]  What, are you drunk?  No.  And if I was, I'd be put you in the place.  What, do you drink Listerine?  No, I can afford alcohol.  Plus, I'm over 21, so I can get it.  Obviously not.  You're not selling anything.  I bet you don't even have a cell phone.  You have a beeper.  I do not have a beeper.  Yes, you do.  I don't have a cell phone, and it has many...  What is it?  One of those old Nokia's?  What?  Where did you pick that up?  It's garbage dump?  No.  It stinks great.  Get it there.  Obviously, you need to get laid.  You need to stop getting laid, because you're going to be a stripper.  Well, at least I'm pretty enough to be a stripper. 
[00:51:30]  You obviously can't be a stripper.  You're too ugly.  I'm not going to be a stripper.  No one would pay for you.  That's not true.  It's very true.  Well, I'm pretty enough in some places.  Yeah, where?  Hairy stripper.  Ugly stripper.  No, dark places.  Russia.  Yeah.  No one goes to Russia.  Russians do.  You're going to give lap dances to old men.  Yeah, well, you're going to give lap dances to men, and they're going to put it in you.  No, they aren't.  That's going to cost extra.  Well, you are probably a mistake.  Everybody loves mistakes.  They're more interesting.  Okay, well, you're young, and your butt stinks. 
[00:52:00]  Well, I'd smell something else.  Okay, that's disgusting.  You shouldn't even know what that is.  I have one.  Barely.  Well, at least mine's not overused.  Okay, an overused one is a sign of a hot lady.  Of a hot lady?  Yeah.  Call me when your boobs come in.  You call me when yours come in.  I don't have your number, you stupid.  Well, I obviously wouldn't give it to a loser like you.  My boobs are perfectly proportional to my body.  Who told you that?  Your ex-boyfriend? 
[00:52:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  No, well, yeah, well, he said that too, but that's none of your business.  Well, then.  What's wrong with my boobs?  They're very saggy.  They are not as saggy.  Nobody wants to touch saggy boobs.  It's like, that's the only thing they can do with those.  Okay, well, your nose look like little...  At least mine are still growing.  Yeah.  Is that what your mom told you?  You're old and your pores are big.  Cleanser twice a day.  It's the air in here.  I don't feel anything.  Well, they don't clean out the vents.  I'm sure they do.  You probably do that for extra money. 
[00:53:00]  You have tiny little blackheads on the side of your nose.  No, I do not.  I use the blackhead eraser.  It's not working.  You can't even afford a blackhead eraser.  I don't even know what that is.  Exactly.  Because you're old.  No, it's because I don't read magazines about...  Exactly.  You can't afford a magazine.  Yes, I get it.  Holy shit, this goes on for another...  Dude, it's...  Like, ten minutes.  They put it online, and look at it.  It's doing really well.  And Kristen Wiig is funny, absolutely.  This girl fucking kills her in this scene.  Yeah, yeah.  She's way better in this scene.  But she's...  Because you can tell Kristen Wiig is trying to keep up with her at times. 
[00:53:30]  And Kristen...  But when she gets...  When she gets smashed, she stops and, like, will have a funny line about, like,  well, in a dark place.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  She's good at...  When she gets a fucking pounding at making it still funny.  Yeah, yeah.  Even though I'd probably be a lot better, I would say, like, yeah, well, look at your  hat.  It looks like a bunch of popcorns going off and something.  Ah, that's a good one.  No, it's not a good one.  He's leaning on.  It's not a good one.  He just forearmed Sam.  How long was this scene in the movie?  Maybe a minute?  Yeah, it wasn't long at all.  This scene goes on for another eight minutes here. 
[00:54:00]  Yeah.  The when are yours coming in?  When are yours coming in?  That was in the movie.  Yeah, I don't remember which part anymore.  The Fat Girl was great, though, when she's shitting in the sink, and she's like, oh,  it's coming out of me like lava.  That was a great line.  But you know what?  It was really well written.  I gotta see it again.  The cop is decent looking.  He's not a great looking guy.  I kind of...  I just like the fact they didn't go with totally fucking amazing looking people.  And it's nominated.  That's ridiculous.  Is it nominated for Best Screenplay?  Best Screenplay and Supporting.  Well, that means the writing was terrific, obviously. 
[00:54:30]  You want to hear a little more of this going into break?  Well, Jonah Hill's nominated, too.  For what?  Moneyball.  Oh, God.  Jonah Hill, Brad Pitt, and the movie for Best Picture.  Wow.  Was that the one we couldn't get him in for?  Yeah.  Yes.  Yes, it is.  Of course.  But then he was going to come in for the Babysitter movie or whatever that came and went.  That wasn't nominated.  It's like, that's our world right there.  Yeah.  He goes, oh, no, I'll see you guys next time.  And we just said no.  Like, really, you can't stop by for Moneyball, but you're going to come back when you really 
[00:55:00]  need the help.  That chick, Mia Frampton, did we figure out she was a Frampton?  Yeah, we did all this.  And who is she to Peter Frampton?  Her daughter.  Is it the daughter?  Or like a...  Oh, that's Peter Frampton's daughter?  Well, there's a...  Some kind of relationship there.  Niece or something.  I forget now.  We did this exact break.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  I just...  But anyway, if you want to...  I guess we could stop there, but this scene, it's amazing they put this up online because 
[00:55:30]  it's great.  It's Mia Frampton, Kristen Wiig, Bridesmaids, if you want to put it on YouTube.  It's the clip that's 10 minutes long.  Her face is in that whispery delivery is hilarious.  Yeah, absolutely.  She's ripping her apart.  How long was she on SNL for?  Kristen, Jesus, forever.  She was behind...  Almost behind the scenes for a while, and then they finally pushed her into better, you  know...  It's very Meissner, what they're doing.  It seems like, you know what I mean?  Like, you have bad teeth, I have bad teeth, you have bad teeth.  It's like a really weird back and forth that eventually shifts into the next insult. 
[00:56:00]  It's fun to watch.  They're both really good at it, though.  And the whispering makes the scene, obviously, instead of yelling at each other.  Yeah, yeah.  You know what she did before SNL?  Yes.  But I want you to say it.  You do.  Yes, I do.  You all do.  You got to say it.  Joe fucking Schmo.  She was Dr. Pat.  She was Dr. Pat.  I didn't know that.  What?  She was Dr. Pat on the Joe Schmo show.  On the Joe Schmo show.  It's the only thing I think of.  The original Joe Schmo show.  My God.  Not the season two bullshit.  Right, right.  Really?  And she was good at it.  She was great.  Yeah, she was good as Dr. Pat.  She had the puppets and everything. 
[00:56:30]  Yes, she did.  The puppets.  She was so funny.  The Joe Schmo show.  I remember that.  The first season is one of the most amazing reality shows ever.  It's the best reality show.  It's one of the most amazing shows.  It's unbelievable how great that was.  What a dummy.  Matt Kennedy Gould.  Yes.  Sorry.  Too inside.  No, it's not too inside.  The show has passed.  Most people buy it at this point.  Why don't we play a little more of this clip going into break?  What the hell?  Yeah.  From Bridesmaids.  The extended scene.  I bet you only get the free ones, like the onion.  No.  I go to the store and read them and put them back on the rack. 
[00:57:00]  Freeloader?  No, it's for the environment.  I'm sure.  I bet you have HPV.  I bet you have it too, and I bet your whole freaking family has it, because it's very common.  Well, at least I have the money to take care of it.  Oh, it is incurable.  I can tell that you went to public school.  I did, and I learned about a lot of different types of people.  Yeah, you got roughed up, didn't you?  Yeah, maybe I did.  No boyfriends.  Oh, I had a lot of boyfriends.  Yeah.  Gang bangers.  You're not as popular as you think you are.  I am.  That's because you go, ooh.  You open them up, and a guy's coming in.  Well, nobody wants to open up yours. 
[00:57:30]  You go like this, and you go, that's what slut means in high school.  I speak the language.  You know what you do with that mouth.  I don't want to know what you do with your mouth.  I eat with it.  I drink with it.  Well, I can smell it.  And I talk to little shits like you.  Well, you smell like you ate a turd for lunch.  You eat your own farts.  Farts are not a solid.  I've heard of gum, mints, anything.  Breast spray.  Okay, well, you know what?  I'm sorry.  I had a spicy steak sub, and I didn't have time to brush my teeth before I came out to wait on the princess. 
[00:58:00]  You can't take the two extra seconds.  You look a little shiny.  Okay, well, you look dull.  You look like an old mop.  You look like a little broom with long bristles hanging out of a white...  Everybody likes long bristles.  They work better.  Well, you look like a swiffer.  Swiffers are the best.  They're better than those old mobs.  Haven't you seen the commercials?  Yeah, I have.  They're flat, and they roll around and don't do anything.  Yes, they do.  They can spray water, too.  Okay, well, you know what?  You have little nostrils. 
[00:58:30]  At least I don't have a pig nose.  You look like a who from Whoville.  You look like you're insane.  Well, you look like you dressed yourself in the dark this morning.  Well, you look like you're about to sail off to the big seas on your sailor boat with your little bag and your little hat.  It's not even cold out.  You look like a scarecrow, and your clothes are sad.  It's called neutral colors, P.S.  What, from Kmart?  Let me know when the ship sails off.  Sailor, when you're going to go out to the seas with your crew.  And I bet you vacation in America. 
[00:59:00]  Because it's the best damn country in the world.  No, it's not.  What's the greatest thing here?  Freedom of speech.  That's everywhere.  No, you can not.  No, it's not.  Where isn't it?  Iraq.  Nobody cares about Iraq.  Everybody does.  I do.  You look like you're from another country.  How's that for an insult?  Men love women from other countries.  You shouldn't be talking about men.  You're too young.  You're too old.  You're old enough to be my grandma.  I am not old enough to be your...  How old are you?  Exactly.  If you have to ask.  I ask people because it's polite. 
[00:59:30]  No, it's not.  Okay.  Well, your grandma must be a very young, beautiful woman.  At least I don't look like a little dog.  Oh, she looks like a dinosaur.  That's how old she is.  She should be in the dirt right now.  That is rude.  Your grandmother loves you.  No, she doesn't.  Well, I can see why.  My grandma looks like a pile of old rags.  She is your grandmother.  Yeah, but nobody cares about my grandmother.  Oh, you're...  She's not old people, though.  Oh, you're a little shit.  You look like a tired bird.  Birds don't get tired.  Yes, they do.  They have all those little babies chirping.  They have to get tired sometime.  You have lines on your face.  Because I laugh a lot.  Yeah, I'm sure. 
[01:00:00]  At people like you.  At people like me?  Yeah.  I laugh at people like you because you have nothing to laugh about.  I look in the mirror every morning and tell myself I love myself.  Yeah, because nobody else loves you.  Oh.  Obviously, you're very tired.  I'd say it's your time of the month, but you're obviously post-menopausal.  You can't have a baby.  Your eggs are dry.  My eggs are wet.  Wet?  Yeah.  Really?  Who says that?  My doctor says my eggs are wet and I can have a baby.  Your doctor?  Yeah, my doctor.  My gynecologist.  I'm sure. 
[01:00:30]  You don't even have one yet, probably, because you're not ready yet.  You don't know anything about women's science?  More than you, because I still have it.  Maybe I'm tired because I have to sit here and wait on little shits like you all day.  You're going to die someday.  So are you, sooner than me.  Not unless you get killed.  You could get killed tonight.  Well, hopefully.  No one wants to hurt you.  I mean, you're too ugly.  Sorry.  Okay.  Well, you're not a teenager yet.  I'm younger than you, so.  Yep.  And I'm wiser.  Obviously not. 
[01:01:00]  I mean, did you even go to college?  Yes, I went to college.  Community college?  Yes.  Exactly.  And there's nothing wrong with that.  It's two years and it was fun and look at me now.  And now you're working in a joint.  Well, you're going to grow up and you're going to fall down one day and you're going to scratch  that face up and then you'll come back in here and tell me that.  Why are you telling me that from experience?  Because I can tell.  Nose drop.  Okay.  Well, you know what?  You're going to get one and it's going to be botched up and you're going to end up looking  like a freaking piece of shit.  Well, you have a mustache. 
[01:01:30]  And it is the darkening of the skin above the lip.  Really?  Really?  And on your cheeks.  And it happens in women who are over 20.  So look out.  Yeah, you're over 20 for sure.  I am over 20 and I'm proud of it.  You look like you're 30.  Well, that's good.  You know what?  You look like a crazy little pit bull with a mud on her face.  You're just saying that because you haven't been laid in a year.  No, I'm saying that because you look like a pit bull.  No, I don't.  And I have been laid in a year.  I am a...  I sleep around.  Yeah, slut.  No.  It's called being in my 30s.  Yeah, 30s.  Old.  I can see gray hairs. 
[01:02:00]  Okay, they're blonde.  And you will be old.  You don't get gray hairs until you're 45.  You're just saying that because you have them.  You're going to get hair where you don't even know you can.  In between your boobs.  I think you're talking from experience.  No, I'm not.  It's growing out of your shirt.  Very funny.  How did you get it?  By sleeping with a gang of bikers?  There's nothing wrong with bikers.  They have free spirits.  Well, you need to go to the dentist.  Okay, well, you need to go to the free clinic.  I don't need a free clinic.  I have enough money.  Okay, Alec.  It's Trebek. 
[01:02:30]  That doesn't even make sense.  Yes, it does.  No, it doesn't.  If you were smart enough...  You wouldn't even win money on that show.  Because obviously...  Well, you're too young to go on that show, so take that, sister.  Haven't you ever heard of Kids Jeopardy?  It's called Teen Jeopardy.  No, there isn't.  There's Kids Jeopardy, too.  You're too old to even know that.  I don't watch.  That would be weird if I watched that.  Exactly, because you're not smart.  That is really mean.  No, it's not.  It's the truth.  At least I'm not asexual.  I am a full-blown woman.  Well, you're an old, single loser who works at a jewelry store,  colors her own hair, 
[01:03:00]  and won't never know the feeling of owning a luxury car.  Well, you know who you are?  You are a dirty little ass-licking whore.  You're old, miserable.  You'll never get what you want in life.  And you'll be alone forever, with no friends.  Okay.  You are a twatty little shit-faced fucker.  Well, you're still an old, single loser, 
[01:03:30]  with no friends, and no ex.  Well, you know what you are?  You're a little cunt.  You're fired.  She's fired.  She's fired.  I'm sorry.  She's fired.  She's fired.  You're fired.  You are fired.  You are F-I-R-E-D fired!  Fired!  You're fired!  You're fired!  You're fired!  You're fired!  You're fired, F-I-R-E-D!  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  Yeah.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show. 
[01:04:00]  I think that was some child of the 80s stuff right there.  I remember it well.  Fuck yeah, man.  Yeah, remember that?  Love those days.  God.  So nostalgic, thinking back to my childhood, 80s.  We, uh, we...  Goonies.  We got the Groundhog Day thing, huh?  It happened?  Yes, it happened.  Do we have the clip?  Where is the clip?  We'll have the clip any second.  I don't want to be a spoiler.  Because the people need to know if the winter's going to last six more weeks or not. 
[01:04:30]  Yeah.  Ooh.  But how this winter's going, Groundhog Day is stupid.  Obviously, we didn't even have a winter, so it's nonsense today.  So it's like, yeah, six more weeks of this.  Well, all of a sudden, it's going to be a shitty winter.  I'll take it.  Are you forgetting about something?  Huh?  Oh, shit.  First break break.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  Wow.  Right.  Boy, we sure don't give a shit about this bit anymore.  Yeah.  Since he actually...  You know what happened?  Yesterday, he pulled one off that wasn't that bad, and it ruined the whole bit. 
[01:05:00]  You're down with it.  I had no idea.  If you remember yesterday, I had no comment.  I wasn't able to bash him or anything.  I forgot what he did yesterday.  He played the Justin Timberlake song.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And I was just like, all right, well, I guess he hit it.  End of bit.  Well, let's do it.  Get in topical.  Hold up.  Wait a minute.  With the Sex Man.  Good morning, Sexy.  Hi.  Good morning.  This is like an afterthought now. 
[01:05:30]  Is this...  I'll just tell you.  Sid Vicious died of a drug overdose 33 years ago.  This is Motorhead doing God Save the Queen.  It's a good song.  Is it a good song?  You know Motorhead.  You like this?  It's a great cover.  It's a great cover of Sex Pistols.  No, I know that, but do you like him?  Do I like this version?  Yeah.  I like this song.  I'm not a huge Sex Pistols fan, but I like him.  We lost Angelo Dundee overnight. 
[01:06:00]  Didn't know that.  The legendary trainer for Muhammad Ali and Sugar Ray Leonard.  Sugar Ray Leonard was in here talking about...  We lost Sugar Ray Leonard?  No, no, no, no, no.  Oh, I thought you were pulling a Boston mayor gag.  But Angelo Dundee also trained Sugar Ray Leonard.  Angelo Dundee.  Yeah, of course.  Yeah, I remember that.  Sure.  Died overnight at the age of 90.  He called Ali a kid, I think.  All his life he called him a kid.  This is turning out to be a very tragic start to Black History Month.  Why?  Don Cornelius.  I don't think Dundee was black. 
[01:06:30]  What?  Oh, wait, was he?  No, no, no.  He's totally white.  He's a white guy.  He scared me.  What are you talking about?  No, but he was beloved by the black boxers.  Oh, I think that's a stretch.  I don't.  No?  Anytime I could bring a little tragedy to February.  Right.  Ah, yes.  What are you doing just sitting on the sofa?  I wasn't inviting you.  Oh, stop.  You just walked in.  Once you're in the studio, everything's fair game.  But here's the thing, honey. 
[01:07:00]  I'm not that kind of guy.  Here's the thing.  You are that kind of guy.  You're a pushy Jew.  You are.  I'm not a pushy Jew at all.  I'm not.  I'm a fucking, I'm a giver.  You're a giver, not a taker?  You're not a giver.  Oh, are you kidding me?  I just, I just, his body, who is very brilliant, is helping me look at something.  And Voss is hinting that they're going to want money.  I didn't say I want money.  Shut up.  I said to him, quit calling my wife for fucking freebies, you fucking creep.  All right?  She's not foreign to you.  Here's the thing.  She's helping me look at something.  She doesn't have to help me.  No, she does.  She likes doing it.  Oh, man.  She said she likes doing it. 
[01:07:30]  Because it makes you feel good about herself.  She wants money.  I don't want money from your fucking horribleness.  Holy shit.  First of all, I'm not even doing that.  There's a real thing going on.  Do you know what a favor is?  Do you know what a favor is?  Yeah, something you haven't done for me ever.  Okay?  What is Bonnie doing for you?  What is Bonnie doing for you?  I'm not giving you your number.  That was a favor.  I was looking over, I wrote.  Oh, so she's looking over some writings you're doing.  A couple of scripts.  Because Bonnie's a very good writer.  She's a great writer.  I just wanted, I hate to say another set of eyes, but you want another person who hasn't  been involved in the process at all.  Right.  Because there's something, I'm hoping it will hit somebody like, oh yeah, this would 
[01:08:00]  be maybe adjusted slightly or maybe see something that you're not seeing and Rich wants money.  I don't really know.  He's joking, but he does.  I don't know.  I can tell by Jimmy's face that he's serious.  What do you say to Jimmy?  What is it I said to fucking Jimmy?  Because he sent Bonnie and Bonnie took time.  I mean, we're very busy fucking people.  I'm working deep clubs.  Did you hear that?  All right.  She took some time.  No, wait, hold on.  We'll be relaxed.  You want to get paid.  No, no.  We don't want to get paid at all. 
[01:08:30]  Why would we be weak?  Am I asking you?  Listen, I'm her fucking manager.  Shut up.  Wow, this friendship is breaking up in front of our eyes.  No, it's not breaking up.  No, I'm not going to be friends with that.  How could I not be friends with a guy that uses a co-host to host?  But what I'm saying is.  Shut up.  You brought Florentine out.  You're the fucking host.  You're not Martha Stewart.  You don't have a warm-up before you host.  You're the fucking host.  No, but it's a fucking casino gig.  I'm not walking out in front of 2,000 people as they're filing in, unlike you when they're  filing out.  Stupid.  Don't get mad.  Don't get mad. 
[01:09:00]  You're being cunty.  No, I'm not being cunty.  Yes, you are.  Fuck you.  I'm being cunty.  Yes.  Let me explain to you.  I'm not being cunty.  Yes, you are.  I'm being funny.  If I did that, you would fucking smash me for a year.  To have somebody go on every time I fucking go on.  When we did the ONA virus tour, if I had somebody go on before me to warm them up, for  me to warm up the crowd, you would fucking smash me for a year.  I'm hosting.  I'm one of the four guys hosting the show.  I'm not on the show.  I'm not the warm-up.  I know.  We have a guy go up, because what happens is it's a playoff game, and I realize that 
[01:09:30]  the shows are much better when somebody goes on and kills up front.  What's the matter with that?  Well, I think Florentine should have been able to have a warm-up.  But Florentine was a surprise guest, you dope.  He used dope.  I'm not being cunty.  I'm not being cunty.  We're talking about anti-social, where Jimmy decided to have Florentine do a little time  before he hit the stage.  But it wasn't because we were all happy to have Florentine on the show.  Yes.  Of course.  Of course.  He's a funny guy, and he's well-known.  Right.  But when people are happy, when somebody does a guest spot, they do it in the middle of the 
[01:10:00]  show, not in the beginning.  That's just how guest spots are.  Well, you do enough of them, you should know.  This was another guy who was a special guest, and we did have him go up first, because fucking  it's, I have to be out there and come back, and I'm not doing fucking five minutes, I'm  doing 15 minutes.  But when I hosted On A Virus, they were fucking walking in.  Well, good for you.  Okay.  Who cares?  Good for you.  Terrific.  Yeah.  All right.  But here's the thing.  Body. 
[01:10:30]  Wow, this is a bad start to your appearance.  What do you mean it's a bad start?  Very confidential, Rich.  You want, you're very confrontational.  You want body to get paid to look at a script?  He does.  No, I don't.  And you're trashing Jimmy's fucking comedy tour that he's putting together.  I'm not.  I'm fucking with Jesus.  He destroys me every time I come in here about my being a host.  No, but when I came out, he shouldn't.  This is what I said to him.  I'll tell you, let me, he, I said, first of all, you're not aging well.  That's all.  But he might have gotten mad about that.  No, I didn't.  I still look young.  I'm just tired.  Okay.  Wait, you said he's not aging well, too? 
[01:11:00]  He's not.  You can tell when he's like 50, he's going to be very creepy.  And I said, I just as a friend, telling another friend, all right, you know.  What would you know about friendship?  What are you talking about?  Are you kidding me?  So here's the thing.  He asked, and Bonnie likes doing that.  She likes helping people out.  Okay.  Yeah, I hope so.  We're friends for years.  And then he said, can you meet me in New York and do, you know, whatever.  And that's cool, too, because she's coming in Monday.  She said.  She would do it.  Bonnie said that we could meet and sit down. 
[01:11:30]  I'm like, great.  But I flew home from LA.  She was in LA.  She was in the city for something else.  She didn't come in to see me.  She was in for something else.  And I had flown home on the red eye.  And I went home to lay down for an hour.  I just slept.  And I texted her after.  I'm like, sorry, I was fucking crashed.  She goes, I had no big deal.  Because she was already there for something else.  Right.  She likes doing it.  She really does.  But I'm joking with him.  This is.  He takes it.  He takes it too little because he.  I took it literal because you said it more than once.  No, I said it one time.  I know what humor is.  I do it for a living, too.  I said it one time.  Yeah.  If someone's in front of you.  I said. 
[01:12:00]  Well, I said.  I said to him.  You know, she looked at your stuff.  I go, when you bring your BMW in and you get a mirror on the BMW and fix your BMW, you get it for free.  That's all.  I just said.  I'm just, you know, throwing a little joke out there.  And I joked back and I'm like, well, I would hope so if I could plug the BMW company enough.  Yeah.  If I've mentioned the BMW.  But he's kind of kidding.  No, I'm not.  But he's like, eh.  I'll call Bonnie.  The last thing we.  You want Bonnie to get paid.  No, I don't.  No, I don't.  I want $25,000 from you to invest in our fucking movie. 
[01:12:30]  Or today I have to sell 5,000 CDs.  That's the fucking reason.  I have to sell 5,000 CDs.  That'll be a thousand times what you've sold already.  5,000 CDs today I have to sell.  But you want Bonnie to get paid from Jimmy.  No, I don't.  Not at all.  It's because she's friends.  What friends?  Friends help friends out.  Yeah, but it sounds like you brought it up enough.  You're saying friends help friends out because it sounds like a PSA.  It's not coming from the heart.  He's saying that.  That's not true.  That's not true.  Why do you feel like she needs.  That's not true.  Why do you feel like she wants to get paid, Jimmy?  I don't know if she does or not. 
[01:13:00]  I haven't thought about it.  She doesn't want to get paid.  Are you getting that vibe from Rich?  No.  From Rich.  Not at all.  Not at all.  So Bonnie's out of this.  Bonnie's like.  Okay, this is Rich.  It's all about doing a favor.  Oh, my God.  You're pimping your wife out?  I wish I could, but she's too old.  Look at that fucking wrinkled prune.  Jesus Christ.  Let's break this down.  How much money do you want from Jimmy?  Nothing.  Not a thing.  This is what I want from him.  Okay, this is what I want. 
[01:13:30]  Listen, what I'm talking about, we're friends.  If Jimmy's done roasts where I've looked over jokes of his, he's looked over jokes of mine.  We do it with Jeff.  We do it with everybody.  We help each other out.  We're friends.  There's a misunderstanding here.  It was a joke, and maybe he took it away.  Maybe it was too early in the morning.  I think you were feeling him out.  Yeah, I think you were feeling him out.  I never get offended in voice.  I think you were feeling him out.  And I'm not being cunt to you.  I was joking with you about the other thing, about your pre-warm-up.  But here's the thing.  Here's the thing. 
[01:14:00]  His money, it couldn't even come close to what we fucking need, so I don't care.  Oh, really?  Ooh, $1,000.  That's nothing at this fucking point in my life.  Do you see what I'm saying?  It's a weekend.  It's not a weekend.  It's two weekends.  So, it was a joke.  It was a joke.  Okay, so whatever you have to send, I'm sure she'll look at.  Maybe she can come over and do some decorating, too.  Do you want him to at least pay for the travel?  Is that what you're hitting at if she comes into New York? 
[01:14:30]  The travel?  No.  Between the turnpike.  It's not a fucking open mic show.  He doesn't have to pay for travel.  He doesn't have to pay for anything.  She likes to enjoy helping him.  In New York City, that's a lot of money with the parking and the toll.  She's coming anyhow.  When I sent her, yeah, that was, I didn't ask her to take a special trip in.  She was already in.  But I sent her the pilot just as a, because I help you at all.  We haven't really, we've talked, she had a couple of good, because she's smart and I  know that she's good with the script.  She's good.  But it's like you want someone to see it and go, oh, okay.  Listen, my goal today, besides governors this weekend, I'm not stirring the pot, I can 
[01:15:00]  see it in Jimmy's face.  But you think he's upset?  Yes, he's very upset.  No, I say upset now.  He's not as upset right at this moment.  I think he's more upset that I brought up the Florentine thing joking.  I think he really is.  No.  Because I'm not cunty.  I'm not a cunty guy.  But he's like outside.  He was kind of joking, but I'm doing this, you know, not as long as you, but close.  Like, I'm doing it 21 years too, and I kind of know when someone's kidding, and I  kind of know when someone's going to know.  No, I swear to God, I was 100% kidding.  I swear to God, I was 100% kidding on that.  I wasn't kidding on the Florentine thing. 
[01:15:30]  I was kidding on the money thing.  You don't have a God.  Huh?  You don't.  You denied it, remember?  Yeah.  Yeah, you got the tattoos.  All bets are off.  So I really 100%, okay, on...  Let me do it.  Do you want to bring in percentages?  Of course.  78%?  Oh, I can't do this anymore.  What do you mean by this?  Just everything.  Hi, everything.  The business.  I just want to get a fucking mobile, little mobile home and travel. 
[01:16:00]  Just retire and see the country.  Just fucking drive.  I don't care about the fucking country.  I just want to get away and play golf.  So why don't you do that?  Golf around the country.  Do that.  You should do that.  Get a mobile home for the fucking summer.  I got three kids.  How great would that be?  Well...  I can't leave my kids.  She's young enough where you can bring her on the road still.  I'm not going to bring her.  What, is she going to caddy?  What, is she going to sit in a mobile home while I play?  Oh, you just want to go without the rest of them.  Yes.  I want to not deal with responsibilities and fucking the headaches.  Too bad you're white.  Too bad.  Too bad.  I mean...  I'm not white.  I'm a dude. 
[01:16:30]  It's different.  Well, I'm not black.  So, you know what I mean.  Just get the fuck out and not deal with everything.  You're having a nervous breakdown, huh?  Yeah.  It's getting to you.  It's fucking everything.  Yeah, it just gets to you.  It's weird in any part of the entertainment business.  How would you know?  You feel like...  I know.  I've heard.  I've heard tell from real people that are in the entertainment business.  You can't take a vacation from what you do because you start feeling like, well, I'll  be forgotten. 
[01:17:00]  It's over.  I won't be able to get another gig.  How am I going to be re-forgotten?  He's going to be re-forgotten.  How could that possibly happen?  And then you'll be re-re-re-forgotten.  You're playing Governors?  Yeah.  This weekend.  Oh, nice.  Friday and Saturday.  Oh, that sounds like a great plug.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, no.  I love Governors.  Levittown, right?  That's a good club.  That's a good club.  Yeah.  That's a good club.  That's one of the good clubs.  I would say probably the best club on Long Island.  And let me tell you something.  That's the only club on Long Island. 
[01:17:30]  That's what I'm saying.  No, there's like three of them.  Brokerage and where?  Where else?  Yeah, there's a couple.  McGuire's.  McGuire's, okay.  Your in-laws came to see me, and I think they had a good time, you said?  Yeah, they loved you.  What, do you need me to say that?  Yeah, it's because he's fucking fans.  Think I don't know what I'm doing on stage.  But I've said it a million times.  We beat the shit out of you on the radio show, and you gave us great radio, but yeah,  of course you know what you're doing on a stage.  So you would think four thousand.  All right, I guess I have to do this for them.  I got like six tickets for my in-laws.  They all went, and they fucking loved you. 
[01:18:00]  Now it's awkward, though.  Why is it awkward?  I would have worked it in somehow.  Now it's uncomfortable.  It was awkward with me and him when he said I was cunty.  I'm not cunty.  But I would have worked it in nice for you.  I was cunty?  Yeah.  I wasn't cunty.  You sounded a little...  He really, on some level, even though he's joking, he really does on some level think  I fucked his ex-wife.  Wow.  Like on some...  Where the fuck did that come from?  We've talked about this before, but let's bring it up again.  Why do you think Jimmy fucked your ex-wife?  Well, here's the deal.  And were you married to her at the time?  Kelly, yes.  No, we were separated.  And why did you sound so desperate asking me to praise you like that? 
[01:18:30]  I didn't sound fucking desperate.  You're in a weird spot today, man.  You're pissing off everybody.  Oh, man.  Oh.  Oh, boy.  You're going to get some calls after the show.  Oh, shit.  What happened?  Where did I go?  Voss, I can handle this.  I was going to work in that shit nice for you, but then you had to fucking bring it up  and make it all awkward.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Yeah, they had a great time.  I'm having anxiety this morning.  They loved you.  Are you?  They did?  Yes.  Who liked me the best?  My in-laws, yeah.  What bit did they like the best?  I don't know. 
[01:19:00]  One had a nice thing.  Thank you.  Oh, damn it.  They had a blast.  Anyway, let's do this story again.  So you think Jimmy had sex with your ex while you were married to him?  It's not a big deal.  We were separated.  I forgave him.  He forgave him.  For something he might not have done?  It's inconf...  No, Jimmy says he did not.  Yeah, he did not.  Well, he's not going to go in the air and go, all right, bang it.  Your paranoia is brutal.  I don't know how you live with that shit.  When he mentioned it, again, like, I know, again, I understand how humor works, and I 
[01:19:30]  understand what's funny and busting balls, and I understand that that's really a thing  for him.  Like, it kind of annoys me that he would actually think that, and a part of me takes joy in the  fact that this dumb motherfucker thinks I would fuck his ex-wife.  Like, it's...  Well, she was hot.  It had nothing to do with her.  I'm being hot, stupid.  But I'm just not that big a piece of garbage.  I'm a sex addict.  But I'm not a fucking animal.  What do you think?  I'd fuck my sister, too?  Jesus Christ.  You're not an animal.  Wait, come on, man.  There's a whole bunch of people that have never heard this story. 
[01:20:00]  Like, well, here's the thing.  You fucked my wife?  We were going to her house to watch my death jam appearance.  We were doing a gig.  That's how long ago this was.  Wow.  So what is that, 1990?  15 years ago.  Holy shit.  95-ish, 96?  But as we're pulling into the driveway, to the complex, you could go straight, make a right  or a left.  But you were separated from her, but you still went over there to watch your death jam?  Yeah, I was still banging.  We were hanging out and stuff.  So you could go straight, make a left, or make a right. 
[01:20:30]  You had to make a left to go to her place.  He was leading.  He made the left.  That's a one in three guess.  How did he know to make the left?  Oh, shit.  I don't even remember.  Like, literally, if you said it.  If you told me, if you told me, but what if you looked in your, wait, he looked in his  mirror and saw that you already put the blinker on for the left.  I didn't have a blinker.  Which sometimes you do if you're the lead car.  I didn't have a blinker because you were on the complex.  You look behind you and go, oh, okay, I got to turn here.  I didn't have a blinker.  I was in a complex.  Who puts a blinker on in a complex?  So why was he leading if he didn't know where to go?  A complex? 
[01:21:00]  What are you talking about?  Apartment complex.  Why was that?  No, you said he was leading what?  None of us had cell phones back then.  He was the car in front.  Yeah, so you're the car behind, right?  So didn't you turn your blinker on to turn?  Why was I leading if you were?  Why was he leading?  I don't even remember.  Yeah, why were you leading?  I don't know!  Did you say make a left?  That even helps the profile even better.  Maybe you told him, hey, make a left up there.  Yeah, maybe you discussed it ahead of time or something.  But to think that I would actually just lead you? 
[01:21:30]  Yeah, yeah.  But then.  He's smart.  But then.  But then.  I found Dangerfield matches in her place.  She was fucking Rodney?  Yeah, I said she was probably fucking Lenny.  He was a black host.  And Lenny Barnadou used to host.  He had the biggest fucking unit.  Gigantic cock.  Gigantic cock.  Hey, Mrs. Voss, let me tell you.  You were smoking back then, Jimmy?  I forgot that you used to smoke.  Oh, God, yeah.  I smoked since 2001.  Me and them used to smoke together.  I forgot that Jimmy smoked.  That's how long it's been now.  But yeah, he's always secretly thought that I actually.  But it wasn't you I was mad at. 
[01:22:00]  But he but he actually thought.  Yeah, because the matches are in the place.  Yeah, Dangerfield matches.  And you thought Jimmy left them.  What would you think?  I wouldn't think my fucking friend was banging my ex.  It wouldn't even occur to me.  Yeah, I wouldn't even think that.  That's such a Columbo thing that doesn't really happen in real life.  Matches end up somewhere and it's because it directly pulls together.  Sometimes you just got matches.  You're not a good person.  I used to feel guilty. 
[01:22:30]  I lived when I lived with Jim and Jade.  Jade was a stripper and she was fucking sexy.  I couldn't even jerk off because she was my friend.  She was my friend, too, but she was my friend's girl.  I couldn't even.  And I've joked with him about this.  I couldn't even whack my bag to my friend's chicks.  I can't do it.  What are you thinking about him?  I couldn't jerk off.  When I'm fucking jacking off, there has to be something real.  A storyline fantasy.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And the idea of betraying a friend like that. 
[01:23:00]  Okay, I'm sorry.  I'll never bring.  It's way too.  It's too gross to me to even jerk off to.  Here's the thing.  Where does this shit come from?  I couldn't even think of that.  Where does this shit come from?  Abandonment.  You've got a lot of paranoia.  She lived in middle sex.  Abandonment.  Huh?  Oh.  Abandonment issues.  Thank you.  You have the abandonment issues with your mom.  Yeah.  And it carries over into your relationship where you feel that the woman is going to fuck you over.  I let it go.  I don't think you did it.  I would.  It wouldn't even occur to me to do it. 
[01:23:30]  No matter what she looked like.  No matter what the circumstances were.  It wouldn't.  I wouldn't let it.  I wouldn't let my friend's girl or ex-girl suck my dick.  It would never happen.  Wow.  Ever.  What about a French friend?  Possibly.  Depends.  She was quiet.  She was quiet.  But no, I just.  It would.  I would never occur to me.  So he made the left and you're thinking, how the fuck does he know the left?  And you were the car behind you.  Well, I remember that my matches were there.  So I wanted to get them out of there.  You had to get your matches.  Wow.  That's a bold leap, though, just because he made the left. 
[01:24:00]  I do have a bad imagination when it comes to things.  We've seen your act.  We know you do.  And then you forget the facts around that day.  So then you have to assume so much shit.  I literally don't remember if she lived in a house or an apartment.  And when he said you made the left, I'm like, why wouldn't you just tell me what direction  to go?  I don't remember.  We went in separate cars.  I have no memory of that whatsoever.  I don't know where we're coming from.  I was at his Def Jam appearance.  We were doing it.  Why wouldn't I have fucked her that night while you were doing Def Jam?  I knew where you were.  It's still me and dumb Eric McMahon are the only two white faces in a sea of aggression. 
[01:24:30]  I'm sorry if I made you uncomfortable by saying that.  It will never happen again.  I wasn't uncomfortable by it, but it was almost like if you were accused of stealing  the Goodyear blimp.  What am I going to do with Bobby?  I'm shaking my head, Voss, because it seems exhausting to live this way.  I know it does.  Because you have a lot of paranoia with your wife.  You think she's banging this and that.  Constant suspicion.  People are trying to fuck you over all the time. 
[01:25:00]  I watch too many movies.  God.  Yeah.  It's exhausting.  We've got a break to catch up, but Rich Voss is here.  Governor's Levittown tomorrow and Saturday, and I brought your singing to the show yesterday  or two days ago.  I think I'm going to go to tomorrow, Friday night.  Really?  To Governor's.  It's like right around the corner from my house.  It's very close to me.  You have to leave your house.  That's the problem.  But sometimes I do.  You might be able to do it.  Sometimes I do.  I've gotten out to Governor's.  I go to Governor's.  I take that trip down the old Wampau. 
[01:25:30]  It's a fun club.  Yeah.  I want to talk about you singing Neil Young.  I heard it on your latest podcast.  Oh, man.  Yeah.  I brought it in here.  Two days ago we played it.  No.  Oh, yes.  We were talking about it after the break.  We were fascinated at your knowledge of Neil Young.  Wait, Jimmy wasn't here.  Lyrics.  No.  So was Monday.  So Jimmy hasn't heard it.  No.  So we have to replay it and talk about it.  He sings a great song about you fucking his ex-boy.  Jesus Christ.  Oh, cock talk short.  It's just.  It's fucking.  Do you realize for 15 years. 
[01:26:00]  And again, I've never gotten angry at it because a part of me really did enjoy.  I've only brought it up like four times.  Enjoy him thinking that.  He's brought it up 50 times.  But a part of me enjoyed the fact that he would torture himself with something so incomprehensible.  That never happened.  But I mean.  Is she fuckable though?  Oh, she was back then.  I don't remember what she looked like.  She was an attractive girl.  But I don't.  She looked like Cheryl Cheech.  But you just didn't figure her that way when I married her.  I couldn't even jerk off to somebody's chick.  I wouldn't care what they look like.  She looked like Cheryl Cheech when I married her.  You are a sweet talker.  But I.  You know, I couldn't even jerk off to her.  But I get it. 
[01:26:30]  Congratulations.  I'm so dirty.  Like you said, the fantasy has to have a real fucking storyline.  Isn't that weird?  And the betraying the friend part would kill any fucking angle I could jerk off to.  That would be first and foremost.  I hear you.  I'm thinking about somebody's wife.  Did you take that?  I'm betraying a friend.  But my fantasy would be.  I would be fucked up by.  No, it's not.  Oh.  I'm thinking about it.  It's fine.  The fantasy isn't hot enough.  It's weird.  It's awkward.  I know what you mean.  If the friend is watching.  Come on.  Oh, Jesus.  If I'm a friend and I'm watching.  That's not betrayal.  I figured out something else today. 
[01:27:00]  What?  You're mad that Jimmy didn't ask you to do some time down in the last day?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, no.  Is that what this is about with the floor?  Oh, shit.  Stop, stop.  Is that the thing?  I'm 100% not mad.  Because you're comfortable in that role of hosting and you're like, wait a minute, I could  have been the host before Jimmy.  No, no, no, no.  Is that what this is about?  First of all, I'm not delusional.  I don't draw even close to the people that drew on that show.  So I don't expect to be on that show.  It's about drawing.  The tickets were already sold.  And then Norton said, look, I'm going to give my friend a few minutes up front.  I wouldn't want to do it. 
[01:27:30]  And you're mad that he didn't ask you.  You're 100% wrong.  You're 100% wrong.  Because one, I didn't have CDs to sell after the show.  So why would I want to go on stage?  Two, for me, for me, in that show, not Florentine, for me, it's a lose-lose situation.  Because to warm up, nothing's going to come out of it, but it could be a fucking debacle.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, Jim killed him first.  Jim killed.  Florentine was great.  But he doesn't have the animosity from the O&A audience that sometimes I get.  That was a predominant. 
[01:28:00]  That was more of a Howard crowd.  They were much more there.  It was a big Howard presence.  I had a good time going sometimes not working.  Just going and enjoying, hanging with them, watching them.  You're 100% wrong on that.  All right.  The animosity, I think that's more of your paranoia, too.  Maybe a little.  I've heard that the fans are great to you.  They are.  Around America.  They were on the tour.  It was great.  All right.  Cock talk with Mars there, Sam.  Cock talk.  All right.  Quick set up here, please. 
[01:28:30]  Mars, I guess, was on a different radio show.  I was just listening and I heard it.  Oh.  All right.  Welcome back to Cock Talk.  I'm Mistress Vixen.  Today, we're talking about your first man-on-man experience.  We have Mars on the phone from Puerto Rico.  Mars, talk to me, baby.  I'm a changed man as of yesterday. 
[01:29:00]  Yeah, I'm a fucking changed man.  I'm not the same.  Mars, I see here you had your first gay experience last night.  Yeah.  Yummy.  So tell me, what was that little asshole of yours like before the big night?  My shit is so tight, man.  I guess I'm anal retentive.  It's so tight.  Mm, sexy.  And what was going through your head when you whipped out that big dick?  He tells me to lie down on my left side and I'm facing a particular direction. 
[01:29:30]  And then he pulls his apparatus out.  I'm like, hell no, that shit is not going near me.  Sure enough, he goes behind me.  How big was it?  It was, I swear to God, about two feet long.  Ooh, you're a spicy little bitch, aren't you?  And what did he say before he put it in you?  Did he ease it in?  I'm just feeling for a second and all of a sudden this motherfucker, all the way in my ass.  Ooh, you lucky little taquito.  Tell me more. 
[01:30:00]  He goes like, he goes like this, come on, buddy, help me, help me here, work with me.  Let me do my job.  What was that job?  Open my ass.  I don't know how you guys do it, just letting that rainbow-striped freak flag fly.  Come on, alcohol, alcohol.  This all sounds so dirty.  How'd you get cleaned up after?  Did he do it for you?  Yeah, he cleaned it afterwards.  No, he did it afterwards in front of me.  No, he did.  Ooh, how did he do that?  What is it, tossed salad?  You could toss my salad anytime. 
[01:30:30]  Ooh, he licked your asshole clean with his tongue?  Exactly.  My God, Mars, you are so naughty.  Any guy would be lucky to go south of the border with you.  This is our secret, don't tell anybody.  What I wouldn't give to have a dick sometimes.  Well, tune in next week when Cock Talk returns  and we talk to guys about their first time with a down-low brother, Mars.  I bet you have a story like that, don't you?  Yeah.  Ooh, you little Spanish fly, you've got me all wet. 
[01:31:00]  See you next week for more Cock Talk.  Hi, this is Louis Flack.  Hi, this is Jay Moore.  Hi, this is Ricky Gervais.  Hello, this is Louis C.K.  And you are right now listening to Opie and Anthony.  I don't know you, but I fucking, I hate you right now.  Don't, don't, don't.  Rich Vossen Studio playing Governors in Leavittown, Long Island, tomorrow and Saturday. 
[01:31:30]  I would highly recommend you go see him.  Oh, yeah.  And because Rich called me out, he goes, what bit did your in-laws like?  Oh, boy.  My father-in-law wrote, I didn't ask him to write, by the way.  He was excited.  He wanted to be in on this.  He wrote, the way he brushes Bonnie's hair and he beat up the lesbos.  Just a great set, thanks.  Oh, I...  And then he says, again, see you on the course, because he wants to play in golf. 
[01:32:00]  Again.  I kind of ad-libbed a bit.  I turned into a bit.  I go, how many people put a hairbrush in their ass?  Right.  And then I go, sometimes we'll do it for floor play.  I'll put a hairbrush in my ass and then I'll brush Bonnie's hair.  With hair.  I know, it just came out of an ad-lib.  But there you go.  They were fun.  You asked and he wrote me.  I didn't, I didn't, I didn't ask him for an answer.  And I think I even threw him some CDs.  Oh, really?  That's nice. 
[01:32:30]  Real nice of you.  I think I...  That's real nice.  Half price.  Two of them, no.  Oh, really?  No, two of them, free.  Were you okay giving a couple CDs to my in-laws?  No problem whatsoever.  After that sushi dinner, after that nice fucking dinner you guys took care of.  Did you tell the story in your podcast how we looked like complete assholes in front of our girls?  Holy fuck, are we...  We're down there for Jim Norton.  Let me, I'll start.  We're down there for Jim Norton's Bregada show, which was amazing.  And Rich showed up and I'm like, hey, let's, you know, we haven't done dinner ever, I think. 
[01:33:00]  So it was Rich and his wife and me and my wife.  And we're sitting in that sushi joint that we all like.  And fans sent over like a bottle of champagne they happened to be in the restaurant, which was nice.  But I'm like, I was mad it was champagne.  Yeah.  But how do you know...  To be completely honest with you, because it's like, if you want to buy us a drink, like...  No one really drinks champagne.  You toast champagne, you might finish the glass, usually not, but then...  And I'll acknowledge, I sound like a complete asshole.  I was appreciative, but it's like, fuck, you know, if it was like the actual drink I was drinking at the time. 
[01:33:30]  I was going with some nice type of martini thing or maybe a glass of wine, whatever.  I said, don't open it.  Keep and sell it or give it as a gift.  Re-gift it.  I almost put it in my fucking pants sleeve so Rich could sell it on eBay.  So then all of a sudden there's two girls.  Not bad looking, you know.  Not bad looking.  Do tell.  Do tell.  Good looking.  That's why I pretended I was upset. 
[01:34:00]  So me and Rich see the two girls, and they're looking in the room like this.  And we went into, oh, Jesus, what a hassle it is to be fucking famous in recognized mode.  They're going to come over.  We're like, oh, we got to deal with this right now.  We were like fucking overplaying it because we were so excited, right?  Yeah, because they were...  And then it was, long story short, she was like looking for the people right in front of us, the table right in front of us.  But it's like she was looking at us.  Like she was trying to see where we were, so maybe she was going to bring over some drinks or say hi, or they wanted a picture. 
[01:34:30]  But we had to like make believe, oh, God, this is the hassle we have to go through.  From high school, same shit.  Same shit.  But it never, not only that, not only did we go, oh, they started walking towards us.  And we're like, oh, fuck.  And in the back of my mind, I'm going, oh, this bitch is hot.  I hope she comes here.  But I'm trying to fuck.  But then we're making believe.  Oh, God.  I've got to deal with this.  Here's our hell being.  The hassle.  She stops at the table before us. 
[01:35:00]  And I just felt like such...  And our girls at that point were fucking howling.  I think me and Rich turned bright red.  We were so fucking embarrassed.  My fucking wife loves hanging out with his wife.  Yeah.  My wife says how funny, like, because I don't hang out.  Oh, yeah.  She's fucking hilarious, man.  She's supposedly like really funny.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And my wife's going, finally, somebody fucking funny and fun to hang out with, you know.  Yeah, we had a good time.  But if you hang out with her, then I got to hang out with old, you know, Dudwood. 
[01:35:30]  Holy shit.  Really?  You want to go there?  No.  Do you?  Oh, man.  You really want to go there?  Oh, as much as...  Jesus.  You want to go there?  No, you're excited.  You sure?  No, I didn't do anything.  We had a good time there.  We're good, right?  We had a good time.  Uh-huh.  Dudwood.  We're good, right?  It was perfect.  Look at Sam trying to instigate.  Dudwood.  Sam's instigating.  You know, your podcast is what?  My wife hates me?  Yeah.  You've been on the radio 45 minutes.  You should change it to My Friends Hate Me, because that's where we're headed.  You already attacked Jimmy.  Now you're going after me?  No, no, no, no. 
[01:36:00]  Oh.  All right.  We're good, right, Rich?  We had so much fun there.  We're good, right?  Dudwood.  And we thank you guys for dinner.  We're good, right?  Do you, when you're down at the Borgata and stuff,  do you get, like, the urge to gamble?  I know you like gambling, right?  No, I mean...  You don't look at that craps table and go,  fuck, man.  Let's just move on.  Is it rough, though?  No.  No?  No.  I feel like he's chomping at his gum.  No.  No.  We're good, right, Rich?  Yes, everything's fine. 
[01:36:30]  We're good.  Everything's fine?  Okay.  Little Joe.  Okay.  Box cause.  You really stepped into something there.  You're all right, right?  I'm not a dud, huh?  You're fucking excited.  I'm telling you.  I'm just fucking with you.  But when this girl stopped at the table in front of us,  it was like, holy fuck, we look like the biggest assholes.  And, of course, in front of two girls that are not going to let it go anytime soon.  You look like assholes, man.  Yeah.  That was a fun weekend.  I don't get to go away... 
[01:37:00]  I had a blast with you guys.  ...and do any fucking thing, you know?  If you're not working, you know...  How many times would you just go to Atlantic...  Oh, you, I mean, not you.  I've done it a few times, but...  Yeah, but I mean, we're hanging out with...  Bonnie's never been to Atlantic City.  And we're hanging out with Bingo for a while.  Oh, oh.  Stanhope's girl.  She's a...  Holy shit, she's a riot.  Yeah.  She's a partier.  Holy shit.  She just...  That makes sense.  She was on stage.  I wish I filmed her, but I wasn't sure if Doug was going to get mad.  I wish I could have asked Doug ahead of time, because she was doing some shit that was 
[01:37:30]  beyond hilarious.  Yeah.  Funny.  Funny.  Beyond hilarious.  That makes sense, though.  Huh?  That makes sense, though, that she's a party girl.  I've said this on the podcast.  I watch Stanhope do comedy, and I go, why do I even do this?  Yeah, he's great, man.  He really is.  Have you ever read some of his blogs?  He's just so prolific.  It's fucking...  He's very smart.  He's a smart, smart fucking guy.  He's well-read, as they say.  The thing is, it's the contrast, because he doesn't hit the stage, and you go, like,  oh, we got a smarty pants comic. 
[01:38:00]  He looks like an idiot when he's up there, and then he's really intelligent and funny  as fuck, man.  He had a great set.  Like Doug.  All the guys had a great set down there.  Yeah.  All right.  We got the Groundhog thing.  You want to do it?  Oh, man.  It's Groundhog's Day.  Or Groundhog Day.  It seems like it was just...  Yeah.  And Punxsutawney Phil popped out of that dumb fucking fake vlog thing.  People with their archaic stovepipe hats, and their oldie time talk. 
[01:38:30]  You know, if I was younger, I'd go there.  It looks like it's a party.  I would just go to meet Bill Murray.  Yeah.  He...  Um...  What?  I wouldn't want to meet Bill Murray.  You think he's there?  Every year?  Or did he film just one...  Yeah.  One day of...  Was it a movie he made fucking 20 years ago?  I would assume the bars around there have got to be kind of cool.  You would assume, but are they?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Here's a few colleges nearby.  I can think of better places to go, is all. 
[01:39:00]  I don't know.  You got all those...  Gobbler's Knob.  All those young people together at Gobbler's Knob.  You got to think there's some gobbling going on.  Some knob gobbling going on there.  Some of the college girls.  Get them a little drunk.  No.  It's in Ohio.  Hmm.  You sure?  I think it's Pennsylvania.  You sure?  You want to bet?  Huh?  He's great.  You want to bet?  Yeah.  You're not supposed to be betting.  Remember that.  You're allowed to dabble every now and then. 
[01:39:30]  Don't tell Jimmy that.  Jimmy will get mad at that.  Well, maybe with gambling you can.  I can't with drinking and drugging you can.  With drinking and drugging you can.  There's no dabble in that.  I don't think Jimmy would agree that you could dabble in your dictionary once in a while.  Jimmy plays video poker.  He loses $5 and loses his mind.  $20 or $40 and I'm done.  And he's like, fuck.  You know what I mean?  Oh, you mean in Atlantic City?  Yeah.  And I lost the most money ever this time around.  How much?  Just $1,000.  You didn't lose $1,000.  I lost $1,000.  That's a lot of money for you, though, to gamble. 
[01:40:00]  Yeah.  And not because you go with the cheap thing.  I don't give a fuck.  But the fact is, I don't have that urge.  I like playing a little bit.  But I really like getting on a three-card poker table or Let It Ride is our new one.  Yeah.  Yeah.  My brother was down there with his boys.  And we used to play a little Let It Ride.  But, you know, I was losing money.  And it's a stupid game, obviously.  But if you hit, you got to walk.  What's the game that I was watching those guys play when I was playing?  No, the game I was watching those guys.  You know, with your brother-in-law, the one that wouldn't stop talking. 
[01:40:30]  Let It Ride.  Was that Let It Ride?  Let It Ride.  My brother wasn't talking.  Now you're talking to the other guy, his friend.  Oh, yeah.  You know, his boys were there.  So they had a few drinks.  And one of them was like.  They're talking to the fucking dealer.  I'm watching them.  And, you know, asking.  She's from India.  So they're asking her the most stereotypical questions.  Indian questions, yeah.  You know, do you smell like curry when you sweat?  Well, she was a bitch, though.  She deserved it.  They all are.  She was a real twat.  Let me get that.  I went there and fucking dropped, like, 30 in three hours.  30 Gs? 
[01:41:00]  Yeah.  No fucking way.  It was crazy.  I could not fuck it.  The dealers were pulling blackjack out of.  Not blackjack.  Pulling 21s out of 14s, out of 13s.  And I would have a 20.  Or I would have, like, an 11.  I double down.  I pull an ace.  The dealers showing a four.  They turn over a seven.  Picture card.  It just kept happening.  And I'm like, marker, marker, marker.  Didn't you move to another table?  I did. 
[01:41:30]  It didn't seem to help.  So I just.  You got to stay at the table.  I walked the fuck away.  I went to poker.  I played poker for the majority of the rest of the night.  I just stayed at the poker table for hours.  Then I got back up when, you know, the sun came up.  And went back to the blackjack table.  And made all that back.  Paid off all my markers.  And was up, like, 25.  And then the next day, another 17.  You won 40,000?  Yeah.  It was a huge, huge fucking weekend. 
[01:42:00]  When I was in Vegas one time working years ago.  You know, this is.  The first two days, I was up $1,500.  And back then, that was a lot of money for me.  Yeah.  Right now, that's $1,500.  And I'm tipping everybody.  I'm, like, a fucking tip in the dealers.  Oh, yeah.  Big shot.  I'm fucking, I swear to God.  I don't get the tipping of the dealers.  I've done this.  Yeah, because they're part of the festive mood.  I don't get the tipping of the dealers thing.  Because when you, like, throw $500 down and lose that $500, they're not tipping you.  Going, well, thanks for giving me $500. 
[01:42:30]  Here's a little tip that I'm going to give you.  It's good karma.  It's good karma.  It's bullshit.  Okay, well, here's the thing.  Give me a little money back if I just lost everything.  I was tipping everybody on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday.  This is no lie.  On Sunday, I was eating 16-cent chicken sandwiches at A.M.P.M. gas station across the street.  Just wishing you had those tip, half the tip back.  I swear, it went from fucking, it went from rags to riches to rags. 
[01:43:00]  That's how it works.  It was so depressing.  I worked Atlantic City once.  There's no lie.  Blotzer's used to have a room in Atlantic City called the Eddie Murphy Company.  It was in a lounge, so it was bad enough you could hear the slots as you're on stage, right?  So the gig was Thursday, Friday, Saturday.  I think it was $1,200.  So you get your Thursday, and they go, do you want your pay tonight?  I go, okay.  I got my pay.  I'm telling you, I lost it all Thursday night. 
[01:43:30]  So now I had to work Friday and Saturday, knowing I'm not getting paid.  I'm in the cafeteria, taking crackers and peanut butter to my room, and fucking trying to just survive.  And knowing that you still got to do the gig, and you already blew that.  I have no money.  I have no more money coming.  It is the most empty fucking feeling on the planet.  Thank God you don't gamble anymore.  Well, not like that.  No.  I remember one time I sold a gold necklace off my, I was in the casino, and this guy goes, 
[01:44:00]  nice necklace.  I go, how much?  Do you want to buy it?  Wow.  I go, we'll go get a tester right now, if you don't believe me.  He goes, I can tell it's real.  For AIDS?  Are you dabbling again?  No, a little.  I mean, I'm, no.  No, a little.  I bet a dozen golf balls on the Super Bowl against my golf friend.  You want the Giants, don't you?  I took the Giants.  Are you a Giants fan?  No, I'm a no fan.  I grew up as a Ram fan, as the Rams, because I played on the Rams in Little League. 
[01:44:30]  You were a Rams fan?  I was on the Rams in Little League.  New York, New Jersey, whatever?  That's fucking weird.  I was an Orioles fan, too, when I was a kid.  Where were the Rams at that point?  In Los Angeles.  Los Angeles Rams.  No, they were.  No, they were.  Yeah, Los Angeles Rams.  But getting back, so, yeah, I lost the most money ever.  A thousand bucks.  I gave myself 500 a day.  I'm like, I'll do 500.  I usually don't even do that.  Did your wife win?  Yeah, but she just does the slots a little bit and comes back with that dumb thing.  The bucket.  No, no, they don't give you a bucket. 
[01:45:00]  They give you, like, a little fucking whatever, piece of paper.  Oh, it's a voucher now.  Yeah, that's boring.  I like that.  I like the ting, ting, ting, ting, ting.  Isn't that the fun of it?  If you win and you got to...  Actually, I don't play, but...  But I would assume if you're playing slots, that's fun.  That's part of the action.  It's part of what you're paying for.  All of a sudden, like, holy shit, how much is coming out of this fucking thing right now  into my dumb bucket?  Yeah.  My grandma used to walk around with the buckets.  Look, I'm sorry, Ace.  I'm sorry, those machines...  You do let it ride in.  I'm sorry, Ace.  You do let it ride in.  You're fired.  No, no, I don't usually play those table games like that. 
[01:45:30]  I'll just play blackjack.  Because you got the three-card action within the game, let it ride.  It's the perfect example of what is said in casino.  When I'm sitting at a table that isn't a blackjack table and I'm winning, I don't consider it winning.  I consider it I'm losing the money I could be making if I was at the blackjack table betting six grand a hand.  Yeah, but if you were smart, you'll be...  I mean, I'm not saying you're not smart.  No, I'm probably not.  You'd be shooting craps.  Well, I've done well playing blackjack, so I just kind of stick with that. 
[01:46:00]  I've had some horrific beats at blackjack, and I've had some unbelievable wins.  So, eh.  Have you played any craps lately?  No, I think one time, once...  I like that.  No, I think one time.  Listen, I don't gamble.  Like, I can't...  I'm 100% sure.  I can't have a drink.  I can't have a drug, because I'll die.  When was the last time you did craps?  When was the last time I did craps? 
[01:46:30]  Played craps.  Why does...  You know when you repeat the question?  Yeah.  It's because you're stalling.  Yeah, stalling, of course.  You don't want to answer.  I don't know.  Fucking a couple years ago, maybe.  He probably put a chip or two down.  Yeah.  A craps, maybe.  I think maybe, like, 100 bucks or something.  I put aside for when they were...  A while ago?  Oh, maybe a couple weeks ago.  I don't know.  Oh, right down there at the Borgata.  Yeah, maybe.  When we were all down there.  You're there.  It's not like you're taking the Jitney bus there.  You're there, right? 
[01:47:00]  I work casinos all the time, and I don't gamble.  I hear you.  I don't fucking gamble.  I haven't bet on sports in 10 years.  I don't get...  But my wife and I were going down.  We said, okay, let's take 100 or two and have some...  That's fine.  She played slots.  And if you want to have a cocktail to take the edge off for the bedding, that's fine, too.  No, no.  But the 100 turned into 1,000, and I was sucking cock in the rest of it.  Did this happen at the Borgata?  That would be hilarious to walk into the bathroom.  Rich is just sucking a big cock with his hand out. 
[01:47:30]  It's like, guys, counting some money into it.  In my wallet, I have a just-in-case of emergency 500, right?  Just in case, you know, just 500 cash.  Wait, look, it's only 100.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  When did all this go down?  Oh, Rich.  I'm only Ken.  Good at it.  People think I can't act.  People think I'm not a doctor.  You know, a Louis Vuitton wallet that looks beat up is kind of cheesy, more cheesy than  a bad wallet that's beat up.  So what am I saying?  Go get a new wallet?  I'm saying just get a shitty wallet or get a new one. 
[01:48:00]  Well, when Jimmy pays you for Bonnie's services, maybe you can get a new wallet.  Oh, shit.  Jimmy, you don't have any reason.  You're not mad.  I don't want to be...  No, I do know you're a little serious, but no, I'm not.  No, I'm really not serious, because we'll call her.  No, I'm not serious.  No, you're not...  You were in a second.  No, I was.  I was joking.  You were feeling him out.  I was so good at him.  You're feeling him out.  You're wrong.  You're wrong, because I would come right out and say, pay her.  That's what I would do.  Nah, but you know how...  She might have said something to Rich.  I know Bonnie likes me.  But she might have went, like, I don't know if he...  As a friend.  Yeah. 
[01:48:30]  But that's okay.  Not like my ex.  Oh, God.  Let it go, Rich.  Free yourself.  It's not that beat up.  It's a fucking...  No, it's pretty beat up.  Hey, here's a little Groundhog Day shit from whatever that guy is up there in Punxsutawney,  Pennsylvania.  I'd like to introduce you, the president of the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club.  Oh.  The president.  The president?  Well.  By the way, I feel like a complete idiot.  Fucking the guy is on Twitter. 
[01:49:00]  He writes, sorry about that.  Next time, my wife and I will send you what you were drinking.  We should have had the waitress do that originally.  Oh, shit.  Opie called him a fucking dick.  No, but they drank it.  Opie, my wife, and Lindsey drank it.  Yeah, we had some champagne.  I make radio.  I thought it was good.  What kind of champagne was it?  It was nice.  Was it?  Andre.  Martini and Rossi Osti Spumante.  I'm just making radio.  It was a good gesture.  It was really nice.  I wish I knew who did it. 
[01:49:30]  His name is That's Not Joe on Twitter.  Joe, it was nice.  Seriously.  I'm not fucking doing it.  Hey, Joe, can you answer this?  Did you send it to Opie or was it to me?  True.  Huh?  I want to know if he sent it to me or to you.  He knows it.  You're not going to drink it.  Maybe he's just a fan of Mike.  The waitress said who it was for.  He did?  She did?  Yeah.  It was for me.  Oh.  But now you're forcing me to say that.  It had nothing to do with you.  Don't worry.  You get recognized. 
[01:50:00]  We would.  Don't fucking kid yourself.  Remember when we walked out of the restaurant and we had to take a picture with people?  You got recognized a lot.  Oh, that's nice.  Yeah, but me, this is how fucking low our self-esteem is, and I'll fucking admit it.  He won't, but I'll admit it.  We were in the back.  We go, come on, let's go out front and see if we get recognized.  Yeah.  No.  Rich said that.  On purpose.  I didn't disagree, but you were the one who said that.  And then you get recognized, but you get aggravated by the people who recognize it.  It's like, oh, damn it.  What a hassle that I came out here trying to get recognized. 
[01:50:30]  I absolutely do not get aggravated.  Neither do I.  And those two guys we took a picture with.  I love it.  It's like, wow, that's really cool.  I'll never think that's not cool.  They're all nice, and the two guys we took a picture with, their wives were so fucking hot.  And these guys, you know, they were average or quite below.  Oh.  And they were over there.  Much like everybody in this room.  I know.  You're right.  Everyone's out of their league.  That was fun. 
[01:51:00]  God, I got to do that again.  What was the best part?  Probably the dinner.  It was a good dinner.  We had fun.  We talked.  Good dinner, good food, plenty of it.  The other good part, I liked, I just liked watching those guys, because there was no  pressure for me, like, you know.  Watching, huh?  Yeah, because, listen, I woke up.  You like watching?  Yeah, sometimes you like watching your friends.  I loved watching Stan Hope, because I haven't seen the guy in. 
[01:51:30]  Oh, you mean watching the comedy.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, I see.  I was glad to see fucking Artie, you know, because I haven't seen him, and I think he's a fucking,  the nicest guy on the planet.  So, yeah, it was a fun week.  My wife and I got away.  We had sex, you know, and I took a blue pill.  Everybody saw me take it.  Oh, no, it's awkward about Rich.  Like, everyone else is staying in the casino, and he got a hotel online.  Yeah, a four-star hotel.  The casino hotel.  For a two-star price, right?  Listen, here's what happened. 
[01:52:00]  You could have got a room for less than 200 bucks.  Listen to me, 10 million a year.  I fucking 10 million a year.  Are you kidding me?  Were the stars six-pointed?  Here's the...  When I was making 30,000 a year, I would have got a $200 room.  When we decided to go to Atlantic City, I didn't hear that.  It was probably funny.  Anti-Semitism.  Cheapo.  Cheapo.  Oh.  When we decided to go to Atlantic City...  But you told me it wasn't a four-star hotel.  They said it was online, but it was shitty.  And that Bonnie was a little nervous to stay there. 
[01:52:30]  So was I.  When we stay...  You don't want to be nervous to stay at a hotel.  It was Martin Luther King weekend.  We didn't know they were celebrating at our hotel.  Okay?  We...  How far were you from the Bregada?  Point Pleasant.  We...  No.  We...  The day we decided to go was the day before.  And hotels at the Bregada were like $350.  I go, look, I like these guys, but not $300.  So we went on Priceline, and I got a four-star hotel for $100.  Okay?  Wow. 
[01:53:00]  Right?  We're not going to be in a hotel.  We got to the hotel.  We checked in.  She took a shower.  I already took mine at home.  We checked in.  We were there for literally $40.  Who takes a shower at home?  Why do you...  Why?  Because it's my home, and I'm used to my shower.  But don't you want to be all, like, as they say on the Jersey Shore, fresh?  It's a two-hour drive.  It's not like I got out of a fucking plane and sweating.  Yeah, you got a swop-ass by that point.  No.  You got an old Jewish ass that's sitting for two hours.  I have a cushion in my car.  So...  Who does that?  Don't you like getting a nice shower when you finally get to your destination? 
[01:53:30]  I like when you finally get there.  A great shower.  Right.  But don't you get the big walk-in showers and the nice soaps?  Look at his face.  And the...  Are you fucking guys finding anything to fucking talk about?  I took a shower two hours before I drove to Atlantic City.  Maybe I should have stopped at a truck stop and taken it an hour before I got there.  We just feel it's a little weird.  Yeah, because you go away once a year.  I do it every fucking week.  Oh.  So two-hour difference doesn't make...  Whether I take a shower in a dumb hotel with their little bar of fucking soap and their fucking home. 
[01:54:00]  That's what I do.  I shower before I leave.  In the big suites.  And when I get all settled in, then I shower again for the night.  Well, I guess you're a showery person more than me.  Oh, someone's saying that because of his background, he doesn't like going to strange showers.  Oh, my God.  Fair enough.  Fair enough.  That is...  Of course, that's a rat spit.  Very good.  How far were you from the Brigada?  A couple miles? 
[01:54:30]  Yeah, we were in Atlantic City.  I don't even know where hotels are.  Neither did I.  If you're not in a casino.  Until we got there.  Near the outlets?  Yeah, right past it about...  I don't know.  An hour and a half.  So we go to the hotel for 45 minutes.  Then we go to the Brigada.  Okay.  And then we go back to the hotel.  We have sex and go to bed.  And wake up and fucking leave.  So what's the difference?  Okay.  And here's the thing.  We were staying... 
[01:55:00]  We were staying off property and we were still on time for dinner.  Off property.  You were on property and they weren't on time for dinner.  So see, what's the difference?  We were on time.  What happened there?  I honestly was five minutes late, Tops.  If you didn't take that shower, you might have been on time.  Oh, jeez.  Fucking Jew.  Five minutes is late?  See?  Five minutes is Hollywood.  Five minutes is Hollywood.  How would you know?  True.  Good point.  That hurts.  A lot. 
[01:55:30]  I'm sad now.  All right.  Here's the groundhog.  I'd like to introduce you, the president of the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club, William Dealey.  Love his plaza.  Ever.  Ladies and gentlemen, my job, your job is to wake up Phil here in a few moments.  The cane that I'm holding in my left hand gives me the power to speak in groundhog ease. 
[01:56:00]  So what are we going to do?  We've got to wake up Phil.  Do it with an M80.  Throw an M80 in that mailbox he lives in.  Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.  Heil, Heil, Heil, Heil.  Oh, it sounds like Nuremberg.  Okay, it's time to get serious here, ladies and gentlemen.  Really?  Inner Circle members all gather in close. 
[01:56:30]  They wake him up.  Handlers get Phil out.  Pull him out of his little box.  Jesus.  It's a very, very long process of horse shit.  What the fuck?  Pomp and circumstance.  I don't want to go there.  Yeah, I know.  You know what?  I don't think it's real whether he sees his shadow or not. 
[01:57:00]  Really?  I don't think it's real.  You're not buying it?  If he sees his shadow, what does that mean?  It means he gets scared and runs back into his little hole and there's six more weeks of winter.  If he sees it.  Yeah, he's going to go hibernate again.  See, they're waking up this fucking thing.  Yeah.  This thing usually, I guess, sleeps through most of the winter.  I wish it just had foam coming from its mouth and just bit everybody.  Well, that's my new fucking paranoia.  What, rabies?  No.  Well, that too.  But I watched last night on Nightline. 
[01:57:30]  In Florida, there's an outbreak of pythons in the Everglade.  So I was in Florida last week and I'll be there next week.  And sometimes when I play golf, sometimes I play alone.  Yeah.  Okay.  You know, you just don't hook up with anybody.  You don't think you can run away from a python?  Here's what I'm saying.  Oh, my God.  It ate a deer.  It ate a fucking deer.  Yeah.  Okay.  You just stand there.  All right.  Doesn't have an opposable thumb to grab it by the neck and crush it.  How do you know you're not hitting a shot from behind you?  How about you keep your ball on the fairway? 
[01:58:00]  What is a cypher?  Well, pythons don't know the difference.  They can go to a fairway.  You can't see a python in the fairway?  Not if it comes up from behind you.  How many times has a black person snuck up from behind you?  They're a lot bigger than pythons, okay?  They might have one.  But listen.  Are you just making a radio bid or are you really scared of pythons?  Now I am after I saw that last time.  When was the last time an adult was taken down by a python in this country?  It has to, I would hazard to guess, never.  I don't, children and pets and a deer, you know, I could see that happening. 
[01:58:30]  The deer probably put its head down to eat something and the python was right there and grabbed it.  Just got its neck.  Eat the whole fucking deer.  Unless you're drinking out of the ponds, your ears going flittle, little, little, little.  As you're drinking the water.  I have a picture on my phone from last week of a gigantic alligator on the golf course.  Oh, that happens all the time.  Yeah, yeah.  I have one, too, in Florida I was playing and it was a fucking alligator right near the lake.  Okay, so say you go down.  Say your ball is two feet away from the water. 
[01:59:00]  I'll take a drop if there's a fucking monster.  But say you don't see it.  You have my ball.  Jesus Christ.  Take enough drops as it is.  I don't take drops.  Take enough drops as it is.  Say you don't see it.  Do your mulligans.  Holy shit.  Yeah, that's a good time for your mulligan.  Yeah.  The one of ten you take every round I play with you.  Jesus.  Say you don't see it.  Hey, I'm going to take my wind mulligan now.  It was all windy when we teed off, so I'm going to take a wind mulligan.  First of all, I'm legitimate.  Okay?  Ask your father-in-law.  I'm legitimate. 
[01:59:30]  I played yesterday in a 50-mile-an-hour wind and fucking shot in the 80s.  Wait, what are you?  What do you mean?  I'm legitimate.  Legitimate.  Legitimate.  Legitimate.  Hold on.  There was water there.  I'm not going to lie.  Of course there is.  That's my hand.  Your mouth's a hazard.  Okay.  Take a drop on his lips.  Here's the thing.  Yes, go ahead.  Here's the thing is where you were left off.  If you're going to hit a ball, okay, you're by the water.  You're standing there.  You don't know.  And an owl, you don't see it. 
[02:00:00]  Comes up and grabs your leg.  That can happen.  They don't tend to hunt like that.  They do.  Okay.  So.  Yeah.  You want someone to explain how pythons hunt?  You have enough paranoia and worry in your head.  Why are you adding python to the equation?  Oh.  I saw it last night.  A nightline.  All right.  Hold on.  A lot of people want to explain to you.  Greg in DC.  Greg.  Good morning, boys.  How are you today?  All right.  Rich, you're an idiot. 
[02:00:30]  Is there any way to build a friendship?  Couldn't you just start with the sky is blue?  I know.  Thank you, Anthony.  What were you going to say about my comedy?  Whoa, whoa.  He likes your comedy.  Everyone does.  All right.  Go ahead.  Can't you tell by Obie's?  Holy fuck.  Enough already.  Likes your comedy.  Enough, though.  I mean, I just got to, you know.  I'm in one savvy.  5,000 CDs.  Come on.  You're insecure.  Stop buying.  You're insecure of your insecurity.  All right. 
[02:01:00]  So what are you saying about the python there?  Go ahead, Hans.  All right.  The python in Florida.  It is not a current outbreak of pythons.  They've been there for years.  More than decades.  Idiots who get pythons, they release them in the wild.  They've been breeding.  They've been killing all of the local wildlife down there.  The problem is these pythons have gone all the way up into North Carolina at this point.  They can live and breathe up until the weather gets cold enough for there to be snow.  Then they actually have started to die. 
[02:01:30]  But it's not an outbreak of pythons.  They're not going to attack you while you golf.  They're going to be curled up into a ball trying to get warm, trying to relax.  They're not going to be anywhere where there are lots of people because people scare away animals and pythons need to eat.  Okay, quit talking like a professor.  Here's what I'm saying.  I'm a teacher, dumbass.  Obviously, you're not a good one if you're not working.  Listen, most teachers start at eight.  Okay, substitute.  Most teachers are up to fourth period by now. 
[02:02:00]  Which you couldn't get into.  All right, listen.  Let's not go back and forth on who does what and who does what I'm saying.  Well, he made a good point there.  What was his point?  You're saying hurtful things and he's protecting himself.  No, he's not protecting.  He's saying idiot.  Why are you attacking everybody?  First of all, it's warm in Florida, so they're not curled up.  Is he cunty, too?  It's not good.  Yes, they are curled up.  They're not curled up.  I know a lot about pythons.  I saw a special last night.  Name two things.  What's that? 
[02:02:30]  Name two things you know about pythons.  During hurricanes and the storms in Florida, that's how a lot of them were released.  Not only because of people.  Yes.  I don't know how a lot of them were released.  Yes, it was.  Yes.  I have a friend that owns a python store.  I have a friend.  It's called Pythons R Us.  He's got a little python shop.  Okay.  But here's the thing.  What's your name again?  What's your name, forgettable?  Greg.  Greg.  Greg. 
[02:03:00]  Here's the deal, Greg.  Has anybody ever been bitten by a crocodile on a golf course or in life?  Has it happened, yes or no?  Probably.  Yes or no?  I didn't know there was a breed of python called Crocodile.  Now, wait a second.  Wait a second.  Has it happened?  I'm going to make a point.  Has it happened?  Crocodiles, right?  So how do you know what's going on in a python's mind?  Maybe that day, that python's having a bad fucking day. 
[02:03:30]  Because their brains are as small as yours.  What's that?  They don't have big brains.  They're as tiny as yours.  Oh.  But they have instincts and they have to live.  They have to sleep.  Listen.  I worry more about other people hitting golf balls at me.  I did that much.  Than a dumb python.  Well, you should because you've been hit by a ball.  I was?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So you've been hit by a ball more than you've been bitten by a python or an alligator.  Yeah, this asshole.  Where are you, professor?  What school?  CCBC. 
[02:04:00]  What?  Community College, Baltimore County.  Oh, wow.  You must.  What is that?  One of those movies where they've got rep stars sitting in the classroom and you're the  Great White Hope that teaches them?  Yeah, sort of.  Yeah, no shit.  In some of these classes.  Wow.  Do you ever, like, dream of working in a university or are you happy with that low-end teaching  job?  Is it a proud moment when you hand out that free set of tools at the end of the semester?  Oh, I don't do tools.  I do math and science.  You know what I meant. 
[02:04:30]  That was a good line.  Jesus.  Hey, where are we at with the pythons?  So, basically, you're telling Rich you shouldn't be worried about pythons.  Pythons don't attack people.  The only time a python attacks a person is if they're holding an animal in their hand.  The python that, there's a picture of an anaconda that tried to eat an alligator online.  The anaconda split wide open.  The python that killed the deer didn't get to eat it.  There are anacondas in Florida you should be afraid of because they will attack people. 
[02:05:00]  So, Rich, if you want to be afraid of a snake, be afraid of an anaconda.  Oh, great.  You had to put that in his mind?  Because that means he's not going to let the python thing go, and now you added something  else for him to worry about.  And you should be worried about the alligators because they can come out of the water quick.  I have a picture of one from last week.  It was so fucking big.  It was unbelievable.  Let me see the picture.  Hold on.  I will.  It doesn't look big on the camera.  A crock.  Yeah, the crock.  Well, thank you for your information.  I don't think you should start off a conversation by going, you're an idiot. 
[02:05:30]  For somebody that doesn't really know, you should say something like, hey, this is really...  You're talking about it as if you know because you have a microphone in front of your face.  No, no.  I was talking about it at a...  I was talking about it at a...  No, there's a paranoia thing.  ...what I saw at a Nightline last night.  He heard a little...  This is what Voss does.  He hears a little something, and then he blows it up.  I saw a special on Nightline.  It said they're mainly in the Everglades in Florida, but what's to stop them from veering  off to a golf course?  Okay, that's all I'm saying. 
[02:06:00]  I don't know a lot about fucking pythons or anacondas because that's not...  You know what pythons can do to a golf course?  Yeah.  Okay, so saying you're an idiot is very, very aggressive and very mean, and I think that's  the reason why you're teaching 13th grade.  Yeah.  So, thank you for your information, but fuck off.  I don't like you.  Do you, uh...  Who's the Punxsutawney?  You teach math?  Oh, he's gone.  Oh, I was going to ask him if they spell it M-A-F, where he's from. 
[02:06:30]  In Baltimore.  All right, so they're bringing the big groundhog out.  Punxsutawney Phil.  Takes forever to just get him out of the fucking box.  You hack.  He's such a hack, isn't he?  He really is.  He's showing us a picture of a crocodile, all right?  Yeah.  All right, fucking start talking. 
[02:07:00]  Talk, uh, groundhog-ese, as they call it.  You would think they would have all this figured out by now.  They've been doing this for years and years and months.  They don't care.  The crowd's drunk.  Yeah.  It's early in the morning.  They got that morning drunk going.  They're all hung over by noon.  That's rough.  Pull the fucking rat out of the bar.  What are they doing at this point?  Are they holding him up? 
[02:07:30]  No, they're trying to get him out of its hole, I guess.  Oh, he's knocking.  He's knocking.  I heard the cane hitting the box.  All right.  I've been instructed as to which scroll to read.  Oh, shit.  Hear ye, hear ye, hear ye.  Slave option this afternoon.  On this magnificent Groundhog Day, February 2nd, 2012.  Yes. 
[02:08:00]  Punxsutawney Phil, the seer of seers, the prognosticator of all prognosticators,  was summoned from his burrow in the old oak stump by the tap of President Bill Dealey.  That's what they call my cock, the old oak stump.  He greeted his handlers, John Griffiths and Ron Placha,  and after casting an appreciative glance to the thousands of faithful followers in attendance,  Phil proclaimed, as I look at the crowd on Gobbler's Knob, 
[02:08:30]  many shadows do I see.  Six more weeks of winter it must be.  Ah, now they sacrifice him with a golden dagger to his little heart.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, yes.  Ah, that's good.  Mr. Roper's beating the groundhog to death with his plunger, 
[02:09:00]  soaking up the blood with his wife's moo-moo.  Dun-dun, dun-dun, dun-dun, dun-dun.  This is terrible.  What a goofy song this is.  You cannot fuck to this music.  No.  Ramp, ramp, trying to get the rhythm the same.  Ramp, ramp, ramp, ramp.  Yeah.  Yaddy, ddle-dun.  Look a fucking.  You'd have to fuck and put a finger in the ass at the same time to counter the tuba.  Yeah.  Ramp, ramp. 
[02:09:30]  Ramp.  There he is, dancing with the plunger.  Oh, God.  I love when Jeffrey Tambor's wife hits the...  Ramp, ramp, ramp, ramp.  Hits the...  Oh, there it is.  Sorry.  Yeah, look at her.  She's too hot for Jeffrey Tambor, by the way.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Rich Voss is going to be at Governor's in Levitown tomorrow on Saturday night, and his  CD's available on iTunes.  What is it called again?  Still empty inside.  Yeah, I hear it's a great CD.  I haven't checked it out yet. 
[02:10:00]  And also, your podcast, which Bonnie does very well, My Wife Hates Me.  I'm a huge fan of that.  Speaking of which, after the break, you're going to explain this.  Well, I dreamed us all the night in armor.  Call and say...  Got Rich Voss, Governor's, Levittown tomorrow on Saturday, and it's going. 
[02:10:30]  Yes, Governor's, Levittown.  I will not be going on that corner.  Will you be in Poughkeepsie at Bananas?  Ah.  That's where I will be tomorrow and Saturday.  How many...  How long is the trip to Bananas and Poughkeepsie?  90 minutes.  Should I go?  I love that room.  I'd rather see you than Rich Voss.  I don't blame you.  Oh, wow.  Oh, you're here.  But here's the thing.  Make sure you take a shower.  Have time to take a shower when you get to the hotel.  Oh, boy.  Boy, he really doesn't like those showers that you take at a hotel.  If I took a poll, I think, logically, I win on this one. 
[02:11:00]  How come...  You get into a hotel, you're like, ah, now I'm settled in.  Yeah, I know I showered before I left, but I'll take another one.  See, I wouldn't shower before I left.  I'm just saying that you take a shower when you get there.  I don't like showering.  I mean, I like to be clean, but I just hate looking at myself naked.  I just fucking hate it.  What's the matter, Rich?  You got nice abs.  You got bad self-body size.  No, just my...  Well, my dick is...  What do you hate about your body?  My dick.  Really?  Yeah.  When it's soft.  When it's hard, it's okay.  I don't mind it.  But when it's just fucking out of the shower, it's just a little Jew dick that I fucking 
[02:11:30]  hate.  And I fucking...  If I had a nicer cock, I wouldn't...  Jim, you've seen his dick, right?  Yeah, it's fucking...  Years ago.  But does it do all right?  I guess.  It's fine.  Jimmy has a big dick.  That's what some girl was talking to me the other day.  Who the fuck said that?  Said Jimmy has a nice dick.  I don't know, but think before you yell a name out.  Yeah.  Not real.  No, it wasn't.  She probably saw like a picture or something.  I was going to just yell out your ex, but...  You know, bringing it back.  Yeah.  Now he's going to think about that.  I know. 
[02:12:00]  Oh, it was someone in studio, in a radio studio.  A girl in a radio studio.  Oh, in...  I already know.  It was...  Cowhead.  Cowhead.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I showed the picture of Cowhead.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  So you don't like yourself naked?  I hate it.  Oh, look.  Where is Jill today?  Oh, she's in...  No, she's not.  She's in Staten Island.  It's safe to see what they predict, okay?  Out in Long Island, you have Hulksville Hell, and it looks like he didn't see  his shadow either, so he agrees with Staten Island Chuck that spring is coming early.  But we also have Melbourne, Mel, and Long Island, and he disagrees, as well as Puxatawney 
[02:12:30]  Phil out in Pennsylvania.  Then I'm hearing there's someone called Woodstock Willie as well.  Not sure on his prediction yet.  And there's also a tortoise that does a prediction once a year.  So again, we'll keep you posted with that, but we're hoping for this early spring.  You know, that's amazing.  I mean, it's an indication.  The weather we had yesterday at the highest 62, I believe that's what it hit in Central  Park.  There's going to be six more weeks of infidelity.  She pulls her head out of the closet if she sees an Amex bill. 
[02:13:00]  Where is Staten Island Chuck?  Well, behind me is his little hut.  When Todd Glass comes out of a closet.  I saw somebody pushing Chuck out of that hole.  It's old Nova Scotia Nelly coming out of the closet.  You have Canadian Carla.  Oh, I can fucking do this for hours.  Oh, of course we could.  He had to say, if you recall, he was making my Staten Island Chuck back in 2009.  Anthony Cumia, philanderer of philanderers. 
[02:13:30]  Oh, God.  What did she have to say about that?  Just joking about her honor.  Yeah, I'm surprised he didn't put a fucking bike lane in the...  Well, there's now going to be a gopher lane for gophers and people with speech impediments  who kind of list as mayors.  I don't know who planted that bomb.  It could have been Puxatawney Phil.  For all I know, a Staten Island Chuck could have done it.  Shit it. 
[02:14:00]  Wow.  Not the same presentation as Puxatawney, huh?  No, no.  A bit of a drop-off in Staten Island.  She's probably like, really?  You're sending me to Staten Island instead of Puxatawney?  Yeah.  Good luck.  Why don't we play the Voss singing thing again?  Jimmy hasn't heard it.  And I think it's worth playing it again.  Yeah, that is.  It's from your podcast, My Wife Hates Me.  Available on iTunes.  Rich and Bonnie.  And I picked up on this from your latest podcast. 
[02:14:30]  Well, I dreamed I saw the night in armor call and say...  Oh, hold on.  All right.  Oh, God.  Don't look at it.  It's really good.  Wait, hold on.  Well, I dreamed I saw the night in...  Could we make it?  I'd rather hear Romney sing.  I'm looking over here because I just want to hear it perfectly with his ear.  Well, I dreamed I saw the night in armor call and say something about a thing. 
[02:15:00]  There were Puxat singing and drummers drumming and the archers split the tree all in a dream.  Why are you laughing? 
[02:15:30]  That's good.  Don't I sound like Neil Young?  You should do a Neil Young cover on my album.  All in a dream, all in a dream, the loading had begun.  Flying Mother Nature silver seas to a new home in the sun.  He does these impersonations.  I swear you would think of it as the real people.  Flying Mother Nature silver seas to a new home in the sun. 
[02:16:00]  This is going great.  I was lying in a burned out basement.  I wish.  With a full moon in my eyes.  Lying in a burned out basement.  I was hoping for a replacement.  Then the sun burst through the sky.  All in a dream.  All in a dream.  I can't believe in the whole song.  Huh?  See?  That's pretty good shit right there. 
[02:16:30]  Oh, yeah.  People love it.  Oh, shit.  All in a dream.  That's some Neil Young right there.  Huh?  That was off the hook.  Why don't we go on tour singing together?  Yeah.  Well, screw stand-up, right?  We could sing.  Now, when I played it the other day, me and Aunt were both amazed that you know all the  words, because you fuck up basic shit all the time.  So how do you know the words to a Neil Young song?  Yeah.  Because she said something in there which proved that you weren't looking up the words.  I didn't look up the words.  No.  I know.

[02:24:00]  why didn't anyone  talk about it  I didn't think of it  until you just mention it  she died weeks ago  but the media  didn't talk about it  Lynn Samuels is dead  the company put an  announcement out  that she died  yeah  oh that's sad  what  there was a press release  what are you talking about  wow imagine  you're a radio person  you die  and no one in the business  really even knows  holy fuck  she was a legend man  yeah they did a little  memorial tour too  where  here on one of the channels  Lynn Samuels  a brash radio talker 
[02:24:30]  that dies at 69  what  would they play  a radio controlled  airplane engine  for four hours  she was supposed  to do a show  and then she  never showed up  why didn't she show up  that's what usually  happens when you die  she's lazy  but that's how they  found out that she  had passed  because she didn't  show up for a show  she didn't show up  for a Sirius XM show  so who had it  knocked down the door  she's literally  in a better place  than  this fucking  shithole  they found her  in her apartment  I didn't know this  I thought Jimmy

[02:27:30]  love seeped into their relationship  their love is much like  a herpetic sore  it just grows and festers  and hopefully  will last forever  even though when it's  below the surface  you don't notice it  Travis grabbed the mic  what's that about  well you want some  background information  on this speech  the Dr. Steve  oh  well  coming from  Dr. K  I just let you guys 
[02:28:00]  do it now  of course you do  because you agree with it  there's a doctor in the house  yeah  the doctor is in  my ass  oh  Dr. K  I have a question  for the doctor  oh  I  he's not around  when I'm pooping  for the last week  I think something's blocking  because it's coming out  the same shape  like it  almost like a Play-Doh  Play-Doh Fun Factory  is it a star shape  or is it an eye beam  it's like  it's almost like 
[02:28:30]  stringy  no  do you cut it  with that little plastic knife  into one inch segments  it's like  like this and around  but it comes out  like a  you know  you're shitting triangles  can you pick it up  and pick up a  color comic with it  you smash it on a comic book  peel up and  stretch Superman's face  silly putty  stupid  silly putty  oh that's right  he was doing a silly putty joke  oh  but he was talking about Play-Doh  but the shape you made  it looks like  you're shitting little triangles  yeah  it's like  really  is it nuggets  no it's coming out 
[02:29:00]  but every time  it's a triangle  a long triangle  I think I got a nugget  the other day  but  yeah  are you  are you straining  are you pushing  oh  I thought you mean  I'm straining my shit  it's not spaghetti  run it through a strainer  fucking Italians  everything's gotta be  put through a spaghetti  colander  water it down  yeah  yeah  put some sauce on it  shit like my mother  used to make  don't call it sauce  it's gravy  hey  my own  the time's called gravy  I don't want to know  the answer 
[02:29:30]  yes go ahead  there Travis  well this was written  the night before  which is always the best  time to write  to write your speech  yeah  it was an alcohol  free wedding  eww  that is so  so the booze was free  let's talk about  the bride and groomer  in wheelchairs  from their accident  jump driving  fucking bender  I was invited  with one of these  recently  I said no  it's like blow me  I'm not fucking  going to an alcohol  free wedding  alcohol free weddings  is so god damn  selfish  yes 
[02:30:00]  you don't drink  then  maybe most of them  were sober people  though  well how about  the poor drunks  that want to  fucking drink  I sure wish  that I had  Tylenon  more like I do  when I go to the office  he also spent  the night  googling  funny sayings  about marriage  he should have googled  things women use  in their vagina  that smell like vinegar  how many years ago 
[02:30:30]  was this Travis  I'm not sure  couldn't have been  that many though  do you think  do you think  getting married  on a major holiday  is selfish too  yes  and they always  do that  because they save money  yeah  because nobody else  is getting married  I had to go to a wedding  that was very  very close  to Christmas Eve  I'm like  are you serious  I gotta run around  like a lunatic  this weekend  and try to get  some shopping done  people have them  on New Year's Eve  4th of July weekend 
[02:31:00]  Labor Day weekend  one the traveling  is more expensive  if you're flying in  but the wedding hall  is a lot cheaper  well ours  couldn't have been  any cheaper  that's kind of  a humorous anecdote  it's kind of selfish  to assume  that you're gonna  spend the holiday  at someone else's  someone's stupid wedding  yeah I googled  some funny things  about marriage  some funny slogans  ah yeah  from Scott Peterson  marriage  yeah  little Klaus von Buehl  the mother and child  immersed in fluid  young born child 
[02:31:30]  could have been  a doctor  or a scientist  instead wound up  with salt  what we call  brine on the brain  from being  at the bottom  of the ocean  that was it  what year  I have no idea  old Ben Gardner  pussy  yeah 
[02:32:00]  little head  fell out  she tried  to open her legs  I was very scared  mom and these  for you  yes  so what else  what other  no that was it  oh that's it  for the background  on Dr. Steve's  I'm sure it'll be  very best man speak  now  who is this for  is it for like  a close friend  yeah this is for  Dr. Mengele  big fan of your work  some funny anecdotes  he'd always put a 
[02:32:30]  lamb shit on his head  at parties  hey look  we see a lot  of twins  in the room  twins  yeah  double vasectomy  Todd  is that his name  Sam  yes  from the weird  medicine hour  one of the weird  medicine guys  oh yeah  all right  here's Dr. Steve's  official entry  I guess we've  started the contest  that's great  Dr. Lecter  yeah  one of my  protege  yeah 
[02:33:00]  thank you Barney  yeah  I got really  mad because I  kept telling  multiple negs  to throw it  in my mouth  I want  viscous  semen  he said  I could smell  your boredom  there  yeah  okay  Dr. Steve  funny  marriage  phrases  yes  Dr. Steve  I'm not allowed  to speak  extemporaneously  because when I  do 
[02:33:30]  extemporaneously  at a speech  extemporaneously  myself  so  I say  really inappropriate  thing  so  I've got some  notes here  normally  this sounds  very recent  within the last  couple of years  really  yeah  if he's googling  then it's gotta be  and double vasectomy  Todd is not an old  guy  this is like a  valedictorian  so he can't even  use the excuse  that happened  years ago  it could  I mean  it could have  happened a few  years ago  but no more  than that 
[02:34:00]  I would get up  and tell a lovely  story about how  Todd and Ashley  met  and how they  fell in love  unfortunately  no one knows  it's apparently  a big secret  we found out  about it on  Facebook  since I don't know  anything clever  to say about  marriage  I thought I'd  consult some  experts in the  field  Henny Youngman  once said  the secret  to a long  and happy  marriage  remains a  secret  and OJ 
[02:34:30]  Simpson  once said  you white  bitch  I'm gonna  cut your  head off  I'm bombing  up here  it's okay  Mickey Rooney  said this  about marriage  hey  take me out  of this room  my caregiver  is punching  me  that's what  Mickey Rooney  said  he said  I was cute  in 1948  and now my  caregiver is 
[02:35:00]  hitting me  with my  dirty diapers  maybe I  should shut  up  about clean  comedy  because I  was kind  of stunk  I don't  know why  people thought  I was cute  that's what  Mickey Rooney  said  Mickey Rooney  said I  should be  dead like  Andy  about marriage  always get  married early  in the morning  that way  if it doesn't  work out  you haven't  wasted a  whole day  even Socrates 
[02:35:30]  spoke about  marriage  thousands of  years ago  by all means  marry  he said  if you get  a good wife  you'll be  happy  if you get  a bad one  become a  philosopher  the Bible  discourse is  on love  in 1 Corinthians  13  love suffers  long and is  kind  love does  not envy  love does  not parade  itself  is not  puffed up  love does  not behave  rudely  does not  seek its  own  is not  provoked  thinks no  evil  love does 
[02:36:00]  not rejoice  in iniquity  but rejoices  in the truth  love bears  all things  believes all  things  hopes all  things  endures all  things  love never  fails  I'll tell you  what does  fail  me when I'm  making a speech  that's a  horrific speech  hold a glass  of apple juice  no alcohol  I give this  speech at the  hospice when I  want people to  not really  want to live  anymore  I'm the get  them out of 
[02:36:30]  their bed  guy  when we have  a long  waiting list  I got  old Mr.  Hodges to  finally kick  over and  give up  talk to him  with love  anecdotes  he actually  read that  thing they  read at the  weddings  I was  sipping a  Sierra mist  here are some  other things  love doesn't  say what  are you doing  how about  now how  about now 
[02:37:00]  what are you  doing now  how about  now who  was that  that just  called  wow  I swear  I'm almost  done  love doesn't  ask does  this kilt make  my butt look  big  he wears a  kilt from what  I hear  he wears a  kilt at the  wedding  not Dr.  Steve's room  love is an  electric blanket  with someone else  in control of the  switch  as we raise our  alcohol free glasses  and remind our  hosts that Jesus  first miracle in 
[02:37:30]  the Bible was  turning water into  wine at a  wedding  Todd and Ashley  I hope you  will be as  happy as Casey  and I  thought we'd  be  Dr.  Steve  it was short  anyway  that was good  oh my god  Luca Brasi 
[02:38:00]  was more  comfortable at  the wedding  than you were  why a  non-alcoholic  wedding first of  all  that is so  selfish  I know he's  your pal  but what  the fuck  well  I think  his wife's  father is a  minister  and he doesn't  believe in  drinking  although  no it's true  so make your  cater to your  the father  there  yeah  and you know  his wife  not loves to 
[02:38:30]  you know  go to the  bars and  slam  shots  but she's  never drunk  in front  of her  father  and you  know  they were  afraid she'd  probably have a  fucking issue  did you do a few  shots before you  went  no I think we had a  flask but I never got  to it because it was  just so  you should have  a little booze on that  speech  might have  but there were a lot  of you know  Christians there  and I thought it was a 
[02:39:00]  little edgy  and you know  in giving them  you know  a nudge about the  alcohol free wedding  but you know  and turning water  into wine  but that was about  as edgy as I felt  I like your delivery  there  at a wedding  I can put you  hey Lottie  hey Lottie  yeah you did a little  Valby there  John Valby  yeah  I know a girl  her name is Ashley  hey Lottie  Lottie  yeah that's  that was 
[02:39:30]  non-alcoholic  weddings suck  because most weddings  in general suck  why did you do the  and then you take the  alcohol away on top of it  why the biblical  reading there  didn't that happen  at the church anyway  because it was a minister  but didn't that happen  at the church  don't they read that  at the church  it looks like everyone  was catering to the minister  they didn't in their  in their  in their ceremony  but it was just  to get to the thing  that says  well here's the other  things that  oh  you were setting up  your gags  right you're using  the teachings of God 
[02:40:00]  I get it  a bit of a long  set up  but you know  I figured I'd  suck them in  with the biblical  revel  you sucked  I liked it  right to the kilt jokes  yeah  get right to that  kilt joke  yeah  I said but  because I originally  said is my asshole  showing  but I knew the minister  might be angry  yes  always cater to the minister  oh yeah  yeah that's why  I didn't say  does this kilt  make my ass look  yeah  what a dull wedding  that must have been  exactly  that was a good speech  you're the next 
[02:40:30]  Peggy Noonan  no  you don't know  who that is  that's a fucking  good reference  I do know who that is  Dr. Steve knows  everything  so he knows  who it is  why was that  a good reference  because she was  a speech writer  for Nixon  yeah  and she used  to be on Fox News  and she had  the most glossy lips  of any woman  oh look at you  Dr. Steve likes lips  yeah  especially when they're glossy  he's a face fucker  he's used to seeing  the ones all dried out  with a respirator in there  they only went in 
[02:41:00]  for a knee injury  now with him  yeah we never asked  Dr. Steve  why are you  why are you a doctor  for dead people  oh my god  that doesn't make sense  well I'm not  I'm a doctor  for the living  they just happen to  are going to die  sooner than a lot  of other doctors  so why do they need  a doctor  one foot in the grave  another on a skateboard  but why do they need  a doctor at that point  here's the thing  that's the one time  you don't need a doctor  yeah  a doctor  no no no no  I disagree  if you're going  from non-life 
[02:41:30]  to life  then we have  three different  medical specialties  we've got neonatology  and perinatology  and we've got  OBGYN  and if you're going  from life  to non-life  there's maybe  and some minister  you know  it's ridiculous  how we give that  second transition  such short shrift  do you yuck it up  with like a grim reaper suit  sometimes you walk in  with a sickle  into the room  just look at the beds  watch the look  on their eyes  they're dead  lifeless 
[02:42:00]  fogged over eyes  I went to see a friend  who was in the hospital  and I walked in the room  and his eyes got real big  and he said  why could they consult  you on me  oh man  yeah you're  you're doctor death  yeah no one wants  to see you  oh man  that's gotta be a drag  he has a good  graveside manner  yeah  that's his bedside manner  he walks in  with his shovel  fucking dirt  on his shoes  holy shit  sorry I just saw  the last patient 
[02:42:30]  a cross and a bible  are you like  the angel of death  no no no  do you ever have  to use a pillow  huh  I don't know  how many  how many charts  do you shred  he just  ah yeah  let me have your chart  he won't be needing  that  well we just freed up  some space  in the file cabinet  he had a headache  I recommended  succinylcholine  you know we were  thinking about  getting a new  file cabinet  we don't have to  worry about that  lost three this week 
[02:43:00]  Jesus  I hate your job  succinylcholine reference  that was pretty good  what  what  succinylcholine reference  was that you Jim  it was  yeah  Jim knows his  deadly medications  I know  I know what you need  to paralyze a woman  before you fuck her  your act  wow yeah  Dr. Steve  you could have  gotten into  a different line  right  um  yeah  yeah lack of  motivation on your  part I'm thinking 
[02:43:30]  it's easy  oh we lost  another one  yeah that's  that's good  for your job  that's good for your job  how many we lose  today 10  wow good  you're up  you're on quota  bringing up  those beds  I think in the  in the new year  we should get you  a like a job  where maybe  the people  live longer  well  okay  he went into  this  no he went into  this one  because  he knew that  his mistakes  wouldn't be as  obvious  yeah  just be like  you know  well they're  they're close  anyway  what are you  going to do  yell at me  non-pods  cause lymphoma 
[02:44:00]  in the end  I did them a favor  they were suffering  huh  unlikely that  you're gonna  there is that  mental calculation  that you do  it did go through  my head  that it's unlikely  I'll get sued  yeah yeah  not many malpractice  suits against  people that are there  just watching  for people to die  how many people  have you literally  seen pass  from life to death  would you say  oh I couldn't  count it  I mean I see  I see four new  on average  four new 
[02:44:30]  consults a day  and about 15  follow ups  and then I do  my office  and you know  every one of  those patients  eventually  I mean they all  come to me  before they go  but do you  do you literally  are you watching  them when they're  alive and then  they're dead  sometimes  yeah like  if we do a  withdrawal  you're a ghoul  I believe that's  for somebody else  pull the strings  pull the strings  pull the strings  come to governor's  this weekend  you'll see another  one  oh rich  cause you're not  good on the stage  no I'm just  trying to be 
[02:45:00]  so far  you think he  writes on their  charts with that  invisible ink  oh god  won't be needing  that  yeah  and when they  pass to the  other side  have you ever  had to explain  your erection  to people  I just get off  on death  I don't know why  I gotta end this  line of work  got a legit  question for you  Dr. Steve  a lot of people  say there's an  afterlife  do you see any  weird shit  in the rooms  when these people  go  no I've had  a couple  of patients  that had  near death  experiences  though  but I  haven't seen  any weird 
[02:45:30]  shit  when people  go  except one  time  did you hang  up on me  no no no  we're here  you're paranoid  for some reason  I'm sorry  I wonder why  so weird  myself  to the hang  up  but  we had a  lady in  Vermont  that died  and  the monks  at the priory  nearby  swore that  her spirit  came through  there  and set  off the  fire alarm  at the exact  moment that  she died  that's rude  on her part  that could be  a coincidence  I think  right 
[02:46:00]  exactly  couldn't a  squirrel  you should  be seeing  like spirits  drive them  crazy  when she  was alive  you know  she was  one of  those  militant  catholics  and she  drove  these monks  at the priory  out of their  minds  and she  just gave  them one  last dig  on the way  out  that was  their  interpretation  Dr. Steve  I summoned  my dead  dad one  day  and the  lights  flickered  Sam saw it  me and  we're talking  about our  dead dads  and I'm like  yeah it's  all bullshit  and I said  if there's  something going  on in the  afterlife  show us  a sign  and Sam's  my witness 
[02:46:30]  those fucking  lights flickered  and to this  day I don't  know what  the fuck  it was  you need  electrical  work  I had a  weird experience  when my  mom died  you know I  was sitting  on my  front porch  and all of a  sudden I  just saw  this flash  of every  moment that  my mom and  I had spent  together  and I was  like what  the hell  is going  on and  then the  phone rang  even the  naughty  moments  oh  that's  terrible  wait sorry  go ahead  you saw all  the moments  at once 
[02:47:00]  I was in  front of an  8mm projector  watching home  movies  but it was  strange  wait the  phone rang  after you  had this  flash  it was my  brother saying  that my mom  had just died  had she been  sick  I saw my  birds and  everything  it was bizarre  it was just  one of those  crazy  wow  but you saw  all this before  hold on  hold on  hold on  you saw  all this before  you got the  news  officially  yeah  that's a  little odd  had she been  sick  yes  no  her death 
[02:47:30]  was not  unexpected  matter of  fact  her death  is one  of the  reasons  I went  into  hospice  because  she suffered  for two  years  and nobody  knew what  to do  and it was  like  nobody  else's  mom's  going to  go through  that shit  if I  help  wow  look how  noble  Dr.  Steve  is  what  did she  die of  sir  stomach  cancer  wow  that's a  rough one  man  Jesus  we went  to the  how long  would that  take to  kill  EROC  do you  think  oh  fucking  decades  years  they'd  actually  find
