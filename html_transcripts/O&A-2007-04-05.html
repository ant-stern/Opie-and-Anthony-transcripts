<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show opened with the hosts, Opie and Anthony, and studio guest Bob Kelly, engaging in self-deprecating humor and sarcastic commentary on their broadcasting style. They launched into their usual irreverent style, joking about waking up various groups of people, including serial killers, horny housewives, amputees, and stepfathers with attractive stepdaughters. A significant portion focused on their fluctuating ratings in Boston and Philadelphia, attributing the changes to a rating system glitch.  They also addressed a critical email from their former GM, Bruce Mimmon.  The show featured recurring discussions about women who had gained weight, engaging in crude and sexually suggestive banter with callers fitting this description.  They discussed the New York Islanders' "Ice Girls" and an incident involving the Rangers.  A new segment, featuring letters from an unhinged woman named Esther criticizing Howard Stern's relationship with Beth Ostrosky, was introduced but ended before the full letter was read.

The Esther segment continued into the next section, with the hosts reading the letter’s crude comparisons of Beth Ostrosky to Sarah Silverman. This segued into a discussion about aging, body odor, and graphic descriptions of elderly people's smells, with vulgar anecdotes from the hosts about their own experiences with elderly relatives' hygiene.  A fill-in-the-blank game using a listener's story about a dentist and an elderly patient further fueled the inappropriate humor.  The show then touched upon various news items, including Keith Richards's denial of snorting his father's ashes, Nicole Richie's drug use, Sanjaya Malakar on American Idol, and the Tennessee women's basketball team's win, all framed with crude humor and personal anecdotes.  A recurring bit involved imagining their grandmothers naked.  A call from Bob Saget discussed his upcoming stand-up shows and the contrast between his public image and his actual comedic style. The segment concluded with a song from a children’s show explicitly naming genitals and further discussions about the smell of elderly people.

Bob Saget's guest appearance continued, with stories about a hotel stalker, his upcoming comedy shows, and the raunchy atmosphere backstage on his tour, including encounters with strippers and near-misses with Tracy Morgan. He discussed his career, including his time on *Full House*, expressing mixed feelings and recounting an embarrassing scene. Callers initially disliked Saget but then voiced appreciation for his edgier work.  They discussed his upcoming HBO special, described as extremely raunchy, and played sexually explicit audio clips from a children's educational video on appropriate and inappropriate touching. Freddy Rodriguez, actor from *Grindhouse*, briefly promoted the film, with the conversation veering towards its racy elements. The banter between the hosts included frequent references to Bob Kelly's eating habits and alleged staring at Opie's physique.

Freddy Rodriguez's appearance continued with his recounting of a funny audition story for *Grindhouse*. The hosts discussed Rodriguez's previous appearance and his graphic death scene in *Poseidon*. The conversation then shifted to Jerry Seinfeld's perceived arrogance, based on Rodriguez’s anecdote.  Listener calls praised Rodriguez's performances in *Grindhouse* and *Six Feet Under*, touching upon the show's popularity in Europe and the addictive nature of certain TV shows.  A lengthy, awkward, and sexually charged call with Delilah, a "banquet bartender," followed, with the hosts engaging in banter about her physical attributes, dating life, and drug use.  Delilah recounted several anecdotes, including a "cock-blocking" story and a threesome, interrupted and met with derision from the hosts. The call ended abruptly, followed by a discussion about *Poseidon*.

The show continued with a chaotic mix of calls and in-studio banter.  A sexually explicit conversation with Delilah resumed, followed by numerous other vulgar and offensive calls.  Topics included callers' sexual experiences, midget sightings, and various offensive opinions. Brother Joe, a musician, called to express his desire to assault Delilah. Other callers shared stories about yelling at movies and accusing the hosts of masturbating during a previous call.  Audio clips of a woman describing sex with a miniature stallion were played, along with discussions of sex, bodily functions, and sexual acts.  A call from a massage parlor visitor added explicit details. A father and daughter, and father and son, were present in several calls. The conversation included a prolonged discussion about a hypothetical video of Bob Saget dismembering hookers. The segment ended with further discussion and audio clips relating to the woman who had sex with a miniature stallion.

The final excerpt featured a highly informal and sexually explicit conversation discussing a listener's experience with a proctologist. The conversation included discussions about working out, a listener's unusual ringtone (described as the sound Anthony makes during a prostate exam), and a caller who described being bitten during sex, comparing it to mares.  They discussed a female Asian blackjack dealer's suitability as a proctologist, followed by tangents on mixed martial arts events, a mention of Joe Lowson on The Ultimate Fighter, and a final joke about a filmmaker's work ethic.  The show concluded with an advertisement for Bodog and a mention of a website for listener polls.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony show on XM202 featuring Opie, Anthony, and James Norton.  We have nothing to do with this.  What?  What is this?  Garbage!  You know what? I can't take this anymore.  It's an awful, awful radio show.  We're really, really mean-spirited, evil people who can't see the good in anything.  I think we've done a good job so far of being open-minded and broad-minded.  You know, like when you try to call the police when I touch you.  I don't call the police. 
[00:00:30]  I just pretend because it makes you touch me a little harder.  Oh, God.  Excellence in broadcasting.  It's too bad you've got to have some form of intelligence to listen to the Opie and Anthony show.  Let's be honest, you probably didn't graduate high school.  You probably have three or four kids, and you're probably a grandma at the age of 32.  So I guess we have to give that much to you.  Tony, I'd like to apologize.  I probably do apologize.  Go away.  Jail is better than this misery I'm in. 
[00:01:00]  I just think Nazi, and I can't get it out of my head.  Jim Norton.  Hilarious!  Hilarious, people!  You guys ready to laugh?  It's got to be the greatest thing ever.  I think sooner have a water drinking contest.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[00:01:30]  Let's!  Palaver.  Palaver.  Enough palaver.  You're about to listen to the Opie and Anthony show.  Technically, they are.  Yeah, I just thought that when I said that.  Weird.  It's like a paradox.  Good morning to everybody out there in radio land.  Good morning.  Hi.  Who do you want to wake up this morning?  Ooh.  Bob Kelly, who do you want to wake up this morning? 
[00:02:00]  There are people out there.  A lot of radio people just think they're talking to the average Joe, going through life, going  to work, coming home.  But the reality of the whole thing, yeah, majority, that person.  But there's other people out there.  Serial killers.  Someone that may have murdered somebody last night.  Horny housewives.  Hey, hey, hey, hey.  Yes?  We didn't have much luck waking up the horny housewives.  No, but we tried.  Maybe we could try again. 
[00:02:30]  And we got a couple.  Yeah.  Just a couple, though.  Oh.  Amputees.  We woke up amputees there, Bob Kelly.  People that were going to have a life-changing day.  Either fire someone, be fired, get a divorce.  That's an ongoing thing, too.  If that's happening today to you, we would love to hear from you.  What else?  Stepfathers were really, really hot stepdaughters.  Stepfather day was fantastic.  We woke them up one morning.  Woke up the stepdads that got to talk about how their stepdaughters bring their friends 
[00:03:00]  over, and perhaps they look at their stepdaughters.  But, you know, look, don't touch, but they're just guys, so they're going to look.  Yeah, that was a fun day.  Sure.  I listened to the replay on that.  It was hot.  So, Bob, who do you want to wake up this morning?  You can choose anyone.  Any group of people out there.  How about fat girls that used to be hot?  Wow.  Fat girls that used to be hot.  Good morning.  Damn.  We went with the hot cheerleaders that are in high school, but that's a good one. 
[00:03:30]  Fat girls that used to be hot.  Now, ladies, don't worry.  No one knows who you are.  So, feel free to call up and let us know what happened, what it was like maybe when you were  in high school.  Nice, trim body.  All the guys were just chasing you.  You were the chick to try to, like, hook up with.  Now, you're alone just hugging a pillow and now, yeah, just trying to fight the Fritos 
[00:04:00]  that are in the cabinet.  Well, yeah, kind of blew up.  You were so hot, you thought you could just eat whatever you wanted.  It wasn't going to matter, and then all of a sudden you got hooked.  You got hooked on the snack food.  Maybe it isn't your fault.  Maybe you got married.  The guy knocked you up a couple of times.  You had a couple of kids.  He's all out of shape, and you figured, what the hell?  Why bother?  And you just, you know, made your ass grow.  That's it.  But in high school, maybe college, you were the hot chick. 
[00:04:30]  Everyone just looked at you and drooled.  Yeah.  Maybe he went off to war.  A lot of those guys with those hot chicks, then they leave, and then they can't deal with  the depression of being alone.  So, they replaced their husbands with food.  And other men.  What about the hot chicks that ended up having five, six kids?  Yeah.  That'll knock the body out of shape.  Destroying the hotness.  Destroying it.  Well, that's one way of saying it.  Hotness factor.  Wow.  Wow. 
[00:05:00]  Look, everyone is ringing the phones like crazy here.  Our phone number for down the road.  We don't need to give it out now, but write it down.  1-866-313-FREE.  Also want to say good morning to Boston.  Oh, my God, Boston.  We add Boston to the list of cities that are liking the Opie and Anthony show.  Every month, we get kind of like a look at the ratings, just a little sneak peek.  Yep.  And so far this month, New York loves us.  Chicago is still loving us.  And Philly, like we've said the last few days, no clue. 
[00:05:30]  No one has a clue that works at the station.  No one has a clue at the company.  We don't know.  They have a new rating system.  They're the only city using this new rating system, and no one knows how to read it.  Yeah.  No one knows how to read them.  And then some of the companies, other radio companies, they didn't even want to be involved  with the new ratings.  But now they are.  It's just a cluster F in Philly.  So we have no idea if they're loving or hating the show in Philly.  That is a fact.  But we know they're loving us in New York and Chicago so far.  More ratings coming in today.  And we add Boston to that list. 
[00:06:00]  Now, here's the funny thing about Boston.  Last month, if you were listening to this program closely, we openly admit it to everybody.  We keep it as honest as possible on this show.  We lost, I said, 90% of our audience in one month.  Yeah.  Turns out it was about 70% to 75%.  Truly.  We lost 70% to 75% of our audience in one month.  According to the ratings.  According to the ratings.  Well, we also, if you were listening, we said how ridiculous that is.  You can't just lose 70% to 75% of your audience like that. 
[00:06:30]  You just can't.  It doesn't happen.  You could kill a listener and they would still listen.  There's nothing you could do on your radio show that would make 70% to 75% of the people  turn off their radio in a month's time.  Especially if the month before that, you were doing very well.  Right.  Like we were doing really good.  And then it dropped off to nothing, to nobody listening.  And me and Oprah are talking going, we understand what this is about.  It's a glitch in the rating system. 
[00:07:00]  And we understood it, but it's so frustrating.  Because people go, see, that's it.  They're done.  They're done in Boston.  And we're sitting there going, no, you don't even get it.  It's impossible for that to happen.  It really is impossible.  No, it's not a bunch of people going, we love the show.  We love it.  We love it.  What's the date?  I hate this show.  I'll never listen again.  I hate it.  I hate it.  And then what's the date?  Oh, we love it.  We love it.  We love it twice as much as we did.  And that's the point we come to this morning.  Yep.  So last month we lost about 70% to 75% of our audience. 
[00:07:30]  We, this month we gained all those people back.  So now they decided whatever we were doing, they now love us again.  And they each brought a friend.  And now they've, yeah, brought more people.  Well, it's, it's like the best month we've ever had, ever had in Boston.  So, uh, how does that happen?  So to the manatees at the inside track, are you going to, are you going to report that we  had an unbelievable month in the ratings?  Of course not.  Cause they were, they were having a little fun.  Their rings aren't what they used to be. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah.  As they were starting some rumor that some dumb show up there was going to replace us.  Why don't you, uh, yeah, why don't you report how the ratings aren't what they used to be?  They're twice as good.  You big fatties.  So I wonder what they looked like when they were in high school.  Manatees.  Yeah.  So if you've got a scorecard at home, uh, Boston last month, 70% about of the people  said to Opie and Anthony.  This month, all those people decided to come back cause they're schizos and they brought 
[00:08:30]  friends and they brought friends along with them.  You figure it out.  Cause obviously just like we said last month, it's impossible to lose 70% of your audience  in one month.  It's impossible to gain, uh, 70% of your audience back in one month.  So we'll acknowledge that, that it doesn't make sense either way.  I'm just going to go out on a limb and, and average the whole thing out and think this is  kind of what it's been.  It's been exactly where, where it's been since we've, uh, uh, gotten, gotten listeners in 
[00:09:00]  Boston.  Yeah.  They're not, they're not dropping off in droves and they're not piling on in droves.  No.  We're building an audience in, in Boston.  The very, we have very good numbers and, uh, that's what it is.  I'm not going to look at things like, like when, when, when a month comes out and we have  nobody listening, I'm not going to just write it off and go, well, no one's listening in  Boston.  Screw it.  Right.  And to our, uh, to our old GM, Bruce Mimmon, go F yourself.  Boys.  I don't know where I, boy.  We get an email from this guy, like back in the day when we were at, uh, the rock station 
[00:09:30]  up there, he didn't understand, uh, that aunt and I wanted to talk a lot.  He used to, the famous quote is, what are, what are we a talk show now, boys?  Boys.  The light bulbs went off over our head when, when that idiot came in and said that.  Yeah.  Fast forward a mere nine years later.  Yeah, we are a talk show syndicated to 25 cities and on XM satellite radio.  So I think we knew a little more than you, Bruce Mimmon.  So out of nowhere, he sends me an email.  He goes, I got to tell you, I'm just not feeling, uh, the show lately as a listener. 
[00:10:00]  You're also pushing 60.  We're not talking to 60 year olds.  Cause he's, cause also he must've looked at the, uh, the, uh, ratings where we lost,  where we lost 70% in one month and was like, I better comment.  Boys, I'm not feeling it like I used to.  And get Viagra, you old bastard.  See, there's a lot, there's a lot of people we listen to.  We don't just come in here and then just, ah, turn the mics on.  Let's see what happens.  Yeah.  We're working our asses off behind the scenes.  There's people we respect.  There's people we get feedback from. 
[00:10:30]  And guess what, Bruce?  One of those people we respect and get feedback from is not you.  Simple as that.  It's just not.  He thinks we're just like, like it's the old days.  It's just me and you and that's it.  Yeah.  He has no idea what this organization has become.  It's a nightmare.  We have to say hi to like so many people now.  It's a machine.  Yeah.  It used to be just aunt and I on a phone like trying to figure out bits.  It's not that anymore, Bruce.  So Bruce thinks that he needs to be the one.  Grab a stepladder, get into your SUV, and hit the road. 
[00:11:00]  Jack.  Boy.  The only station that really rocks is you have talent that could actually talk and get something  done.  Stupid.  You know, you're not playing The Currents.  I don't mind if you occasionally drop one of the older songs, but you must play The Currents.  What is this, a talk show, boys?  Talk show.  Talk show.  Hey, help.  Yeah.  What do you think?  Yeah.  Talkers Magazine ranked us the sixth best talk show in America last year.  Yeah, I guess it is a talk show. 
[00:11:30]  We had the vision back then.  Too bad you didn't, or you might have been able to join our organization.  Instead, what are you doing in radio?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Barely nothing.  Go away.  I'm a consultant.  He sounds like...  I'm an insultant.  He's a gay vampire.  No, no, no, boy.  We have a love...  Blah, blah.  I'll suck your blood.  We have a love-hate relationship with the guy right now.  It's a definite hate relationship, because we knew where that was coming from.  But then he'll come into New York, and we'll go out to dinner and laugh.  He's probably starting a consulting company or something and figures he could sign us as 
[00:12:00]  a client.  That ain't happening.  Yeah, I know what you boys are lacking.  No, sorry.  You were the one that thought Dave Douglas was a good program director, remember?  Well, now, Dave was a complete tool.  Oh, this is good.  Philly has dead air right now.  All right.  I don't know how to pump it up.  No show in Philly.  WYSP is dead air since 6 a.m.  All right.  Well, maybe we'll fix that in a bit.  Let's say hi to Jason in Maine.  Jason, good morning.  What's going on in Maine this morning? 
[00:12:30]  Hey, what's up?  I was wondering if you could wake up all the idiots that live in snow states, because up  here in Maine, we got like a foot and a half of snow right now on April 5th.  You get that overnight?  That sucks.  Yeah.  It's April.  And we're driving to work right now.  You're looking at your wrist.  I'm looking.  Ovi just looked at his wrist.  There's nothing on it.  And he was looking for the date.  I gave the visual of, you know, looking at a calendar.  He actually got it.  Yeah.  It's like it's the 5th. 
[00:13:00]  I'm told by which direction the hairs are growing on my wrist.  How did my freckles?  Wow.  I get a new freckle every spring.  It's April.  It shouldn't be snowing anywhere.  I'm sure it's probably snowing in Buffalo this morning as well.  Done with that.  All right, boys.  Punch it out.  Thanks, man.  Well, I'm seeing a couple of calls.  Where are we going?  I don't know.  Based on the subject we threw out there, chicks that used to be hot.  Oh, I love you guys.  Yeah.  Anna from Massachusetts. 
[00:13:30]  How are you?  Fat.  Oh, no.  You've got to love them.  Yeah.  Hey, Anna.  Now, it says you're 18.  I'm telling rules.  Yep.  You're 18.  You used to be hot.  Yep.  When?  Yeah, junior high?  When I was 12.  When I was like 15.  Honey, we all used to be hot.  So 15, 16 years old.  You were hot.  You were cute.  Yeah, and when I was little, I was cute.  So, like, you were in high school, and, you know, guys were chasing you around, and... 
[00:14:00]  Yeah, talk about your hotness.  Why do you think you were hot to begin with at 15?  Yeah.  What were some of the things that used to happen at 15?  Um, just, like, big boobs, basically.  That was all.  Oh, yeah.  How big were your boobs at a younger age?  Let's just keep it at that.  Uh, they were C's.  Full C's, though, right?  Yep.  Yeah, so, like, some nice C's, and then, uh, what was it like with, uh, with, uh, boys?  Were they always chasing you? 
[00:14:30]  Yeah.  I'm still a virgin, though, so it's all good.  Really?  Yep.  God, you wasted that goodness.  Now you're...  Now, how much did you weigh back then?  You know what kind of slob you're going to get now to take your virginity?  Yeah, good.  That's what she gets.  Oh, chubby chaser.  You should have gave it to that football guy who wanted her at 15.  Now you waited.  Now you're going to have to...  You're going to have to fuck...  Oh!  Where does Bob think we are?  Sorry.  Yeah, you're right.  Well, yeah, he could have...  Hey, she could have had, like, uh, the quarterback, and now it's going to be a  going to be some kind of, like, computer geek or something. 
[00:15:00]  How much did you weigh back, uh, when you were, um, in school?  130.  130, and how tall were you?  I'm 5'5 1⁄2".  5'5 1⁄2", 130.  That's pushing my, uh, my chart here.  It's the OB chart is being pushed.  It's getting pushed a little bit.  Uh, but, but she did have, you know, she was well endowed for her age.  Right.  So, uh, and, and now at 18, what do you weigh?  163.  Yuck.  You're 163. 
[00:15:30]  I gather you didn't shrink, so you're the same height.  And, and what do you attribute this weight gain to?  Uh, my meds.  Your meds.  Oh, boy.  Are you crazy, too?  No, no, no.  What meds are you on?  Um, I'm actually on steroids for my asthma.  I have asthma.  Yeah.  Asthma!  It's like a chihuahua.  You have the asthma, huh?  Yes.  I give you asthma.  I would, I would blow off the asthma medication and stay hot. 
[00:16:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, seriously.  But I'm going to the gym now, so it's all good.  Uh, they didn't say maybe your asthma has something to do with your weight or anything?  You always had it?  Well, they're like, let's work on the asthma first, and then we'll work on your weight.  I was like, no, let's work on the weight, and who cares if I die between now and then?  Right.  I don't want a double gasket, seriously.  Do you have fat elbows?  No.  No.  That's a good sign.  There's a teacher.  I don't have fat arms or fat legs.  It's just everything in the middle.  Ooh.  Ugh.  Wow. 
[00:16:30]  Yeah.  You look weird.  You're like a cartoon.  Exactly.  It's so odd.  You look like Bob Kelly with a wig.  I really do have thin legs.  Just a little baby head.  Yeah, there's no way you're supposed to be fat, Bob.  And by the way, you lost a little weight.  I noticed it's the last time you've been here.  Whatever.  Nice talking to you.  Yeah, exactly.  There was a teacher named Mrs. Hazma when I was growing up, and she was fat, and she  smelled real bad.  Yeah.  So when me and my brother used to pass her by, she was like a lunch cafeteria, one of  those, like, she was in charge of safety in the cafeteria. 
[00:17:00]  Yeah.  Cafeteria lady, but not a lunch lady.  Whenever we passed by her, we would, like, smell her and say we were having a hazma attack  and hold our breath and go, hazma attack, because she smelled bad.  We all thought we were so clever in high school.  Oh, we were.  No, this is like elementary school.  Hey, Anna.  Yeah, we were clever early.  If you were still hot, we would talk to you for another 10 minutes.  Yeah.  We'd move on.  But you're fat now.  Yeah, so enjoy your fatness. 
[00:17:30]  Oh, she hung up on us.  I was only joking.  She ate the phone.  Hey, by the way, Anthony, Philly's back up.  And it's too bad for Philly.  You're listening to us on WISP.  You missed the huge announcement.  What can I tell you?  Yep.  They told us we could only do it once, and it's not our fault that Philly screwed up  and gave you dead air when we were doing the announcement.  Very time sensitive, so we had to do it early in the show, and we can only do it once,  so we apologize.  I can't believe that.  It's a huge announcement that Philly lost out on because they were dead air at 6 a.m. 
[00:18:00]  We hit the ground running this morning.  Massive announcement for the Opie and Anthony show.  And you guys weren't broadcasting it.  I don't know what to tell you.  Good one.  Maybe search the Internet or maybe call other cities to find out what's going on.  Let's go to April in Florida.  It's a woman.  She's 32.  April, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  What's up?  Good morning. 
[00:18:30]  Well, I'm 32, and I have totally let go of myself.  I actually weigh over 300 pounds now.  Wow.  Oof.  All right, listen.  You used to be hot.  You used to consider yourself hot.  You saw the looks from guys, and you knew as a person, as a female, going,  wow, man, I got something.  They're drooling over me, right?  Oh, yeah, definitely.  All right.  When you were younger, what did you weigh in all that?  What did you look like?  I was 5'10", 120, and I had some massive red hair, but not the carrot top red. 
[00:19:00]  It was a pretty nice red, I must say.  Oh, so it was like, was it long and kind of wavy or curly?  Yeah, long and wavy.  Long, wavy, strawberry blonde kind of?  Yeah.  It wasn't like cotton candy.  This is, she sounds exactly like, there were these two cheerleaders in John Glenn High School  that I went to, and they had red hair, but it was the strawberry blonde. 
[00:19:30]  They were cheerleaders, real hot looking, and this, she sounds like, exactly like this.  Me and Joe Curry, Plankfoot.  Sure.  We used to hang out after school, and believe me, I didn't even go to school.  I got thrown out because I never went to school during school hours, but after school,  we'd go to the school and watch them do cheerleader practice just because they were ridiculous hot.  And again, recently, not really recently, but within the past few years, I saw one.  And it was on that bastion of fantasy ruiners. 
[00:20:00]  Classmates.com.  Holy Jesus.  Talk about just taking your memories and crushing them.  Wow.  Damn that, Classmates.com.  It's like, hey, I remember that person.  Click, click.  Holy Jesus.  What happened?  At least I was always funny looking. 
[00:20:30]  I went to one of my high school reunions, and it was when we were at NEW, and this really,  really hot girl that I started existing, like, that started in kindergarten.  She was always the hottest girl in class all the way through high school, and we were really  good friends through grammar school.  And then somewhere during junior high, we split off.  I guess I just wasn't developing like she was.  I was still nerdy, and she was like, she already had 20-year-olds, like, hitting on her at 14-year-olds.  At 20-year-olds. 
[00:21:00]  Oh, I'm not even kidding.  Guys are pulling up on motorcycles to pick her up from school, and you're standing there  like with your bicycle.  Yeah, and we used to be friends, and then it got to a point in high school, she wouldn't  even acknowledge me anymore in the hallway, right?  Well, she shouldn't.  So you fast forward a few years, and, you know, we have this massive radio show back at  WNEW, and it's reunion time.  And out of nowhere, she starts emailing, and she calls, and can't wait to see you at the  reunion, and I'm drooling.  I'm like, I'm going to show up at the thing. 
[00:21:30]  I'm like, oh, boy.  Oh, no.  Oh, boy.  What happened?  Payback's a bitch.  I'm not interested in you whatsoever.  She looks like your aunt.  Right.  It really is odd.  Like, classmates has a little section on now and then pictures that you could put up, and  the now pictures of everybody just looks like everyone's parents that you remember from back  then.  Right.  Like, you go over their house, and you see their parents, and now they look exactly like 
[00:22:00]  them.  Like, the girls that were all hot and everything, they got that short, like, graying hair, and  they're dressing like old people.  It's like, what have you?  You just, at some point, you just gave up.  All the girls look like they coach Tennessee basketball.  Exactly.  What happened?  You know, in all fairness, there are some women out there that they understand.  Oh, and they're holding themselves together really well. 
[00:22:30]  And it's not about their age.  They know they're older, but they still could look hot.  Simple as that.  They could still look hot.  Yeah.  There's a few out there.  And others just give up.  Mm-hmm.  Have their first kid, or get married, or whatever it is, and they just give up.  April, so you were 120 pounds, 5'10", and now you're over 300?  Yeah.  Oh.  No, they're not.  What happened?  I blame myself.  Huh?  Well, I do have four kids.  I got pregnant at 17, but you can't really blame it on the kids.  Do you still have one inside you? 
[00:23:00]  They might want to go back to the hospital.  You know, people ask me when I'm due.  When's the baby due?  Baby due.  So, why 300?  You've gained 200 pounds in a mere 15 years.  I know.  It's sad, isn't it?  Now, do you see anybody from the old days when you were a skinny hot chick?  Occasionally.  Oh, what's that like?  It's very embarrassing.  I try to avoid people if I see them before they see me.  But you're a redhead, too, right?  Yeah.  You know, I mean, look. 
[00:23:30]  Redheads, the statistics of being good-looking are not in your favor.  Okay?  So, if you are a good-looking redhead, you're a...  You better work harder than you're looking blonde.  It's very unique.  You only have a shot one.  Hot redheads are really hot.  Really?  Like when they got that nice head of hair on them and stuff, and...  Nice body.  Yeah.  They're really hot.  Yeah.  Most of them have those chap lips all year round.  You know what I mean?  All year round.  That one yellow fang tooth. 
[00:24:00]  Freckles on top of freckles.  Oh, God.  You can just see it happening.  You know, they're cute for like a day when they're a baby, and they just start to go...  Their hair gets frizzy.  It's just awful.  They're cute until that first freckle pops up.  Yeah, it's just...  I should stop talking.  I got freckles all...  I got a freckly body.  Freckles.  Hey, April.  So, why the weight gain?  Just eating as a medication, an operation?  Babies.  Just babies in general?  Just lifestyle, I think. 
[00:24:30]  I don't know.  Lifestyle.  Just eating, then.  I must say, I'm addicted to food.  Yeah, you like the food.  Why?  What are you lacking in life that makes you run to food?  What happened?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Maybe this will be my revelation, and we'll actually do something about it.  Are you still with your husband?  Yeah, well, we're not married, but we've been together for 16 years.  How's he holding up?  He's actually gained weight as well, so I think that's because I have. 
[00:25:00]  He's pretty much given up on himself.  You're that big, fat couple walking around with the kids?  Yeah, they're the big, fat couple, and no one realizes they used to be in good shape.  They used to be in shape, young and hot.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  Yeah, but, you know, it makes me feel better.  All my kids are, like, drop-dead gorgeous.  Yeah, well, you know what happened?  Let me tell you what guys do.  When they get a girl that they like enough where they go home and meet the parents,  they look at the mom and go, you assess that situation. 
[00:25:30]  You look and go, oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, there could be some issues here.  You look and go, hot girl now, but mom is sitting there on the couch.  She weighs, like, 400 pounds.  She's stuffing her face, and you think, you know, that could happen.  Yeah.  Yeah, you can see their mom right next to the chair she sits in every day.  There's, like, a bag of Cheez-It, another bag of half-eaten cheese.  She has, like, her snack.  She can't even go to the kitchen to get her snack.  She leaves them in the living room next to the TV. 
[00:26:00]  Yeah, it looks like you took the daughter to the gas station and put the air tube in her mouth  and pumped her up to about 90 PSI.  She's got the same kind of face, but only the big fat around it.  April, you need to stop.  I bet when you go to McDonald's, you get your kids, like, large fries  because you know they're not going to finish them.  And you finish your kids' food at McDonald's, don't you?  Exactly.  That is my problem.  I don't like to waste food and waste money.  You think your kids are going to be having kids at 17?  Yeah. 
[00:26:30]  Yeah?  They're little sluts?  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right, April.  I've only been with one guy, so I can't consider it.  Okay.  Well, and...  Yeah, but it's 17.  You better hold on to him because, uh...  It's what I'm picking.  If you guys can.  All right, April.  Thank you.  All right.  Bye.  Bye.  See what happens.  All right.  So there you go.  We've got to take a break.  We've got Bob Kelly in studio.  We're waking up the chicks that used to be hot and are now not.  We're saying good morning to Boston and everyone listening to us on WBCN. 
[00:27:00]  Mm-hmm.  And we say sorry to Philly for not hearing the huge Opie and Anthony announcement that  we started the show off with.  Sorry.  Find it somewhere else.  Yeah.  I would call WISP all day and scream at him and go, what the hell's your problem?  Why didn't you have the Opie and Anthony feed up and running at six?  If you're nice, maybe they'll give you the announcement.  Yeah.  I doubt it.  Yeah.  Call the other shows and ask for the announcement.  Okay.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hear what everyone else is talking about.  O&A Uncut and live continuing the show on XM Satellite Radio starting at 9 a.m. Eastern. 
[00:27:30]  Visit XMRadio.com to subscribe.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Let's get right back into it.  Oh, nice.  A little Hendrix.  Yeah.  This is the Opie and Anthony show.  We got instant feedback.  You go to our website.  There's a little link there and you can comment as we're doing the radio show.  We have a very interactive radio show. 
[00:28:00]  Our listeners at times funnier than anyone else on the radio.  Yeah.  You guys come up with amazing things.  Josh from Ohio.  He writes, how about waking up guys who are so pissed at their wives?  That they woke up two hours early, got to work early, and have pretty much made it their day's goal to find someone to have an affair with.  Wow.  And you know the guy's not joking.  No one in mind, or in particular, but you know what I'm getting at. 
[00:28:30]  That's Josh.  Very good, Josh.  I love that bit, waking up a little niche of people every morning.  Actually, that scenario sounds a little familiar.  Back in the day?  I couldn't spend enough time at work.  Yeah, no kidding.  I was listening to some of the best ofs that we play over the other side.  We've been pulling a lot of old WNEW stuff.  Yeah.  And just laughing my ass off, man.  Yeah, we used to be really funny.  We used to be so good. 
[00:29:00]  We suck.  Now, I'm going to post that on a message board.  They used to rule, but now they suck.  Angry typing host.  Yeah, and I was just listening to some of this stuff and thinking, wow, like we would  talk about how we were watching shows in the office.  Yeah.  Like we were watching the celebrity boxing thing.  Yeah.  And it's like, and we were watching The Office last night, and I was talking to Stinky and  this, and thinking, we used to just spend so much time after the show hanging out, drinking  in the office.  There were times we didn't go home until like midnight. 
[00:29:30]  People were like, man, you guys really are working on that radio show.  No, we're just miserable at home.  We drink and smoke in the office, just hang out and laugh our asses off, watch TV, play  video games.  I was in there playing like video games all the time in the office.  Yeah.  Why?  Didn't want to go home.  Now.  Did not want to go home.  Now 11.01 a.m.  We are.  So long.  Goodbye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye. 
[00:30:00]  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Love my chick.  So long.  That's exactly what it is.  You want to jump back in and snuggle?  Hey, remind me.  We got to talk about the Ice Girls in a little bit here.  The New York Islanders Ice Girls.  Actually, they're showing on TV right now.  F the Rangers.  That's what I say.  Man, when I heard about this, yeah.  And it really makes the Rangers look bad. 
[00:30:30]  Now hear me out before you tune out because we're talking about, you know, New York hockey.  I understand that.  But there's, I'm a season ticket holder for the New York Islanders and-  I'm sorry to hear that.  The Islanders started something a few years ago.  I swear to God, they started this and now most NHL teams have it now.  Oh, they started bringing hot chicks in.  Hot chicks.  Come on.  Hot chicks to clean the ice during TV time.  I invented that.  With little uniforms on.  Yeah.  And they get like just young high school chicks with very flat stomachs. 
[00:31:00]  There's one reason they're out there.  It's eye candy.  You know, back in the day when hockey used to be really cool with the bench clearing brawls.  And they'd goon it up a little.  You know, they would have the old dude, TV timeout, and the old dude is slipping on his sneakers.  And he's got a pail and a big shovel and he's trying to clean up the ice a little bit.  The Islanders, they go, you know what?  We could sex this up a little bit.  We could use this time.  And they got rid of the old dude and his pail and shovel and they got these hot chicks that do spins. 
[00:31:30]  And they lift their leg up to the ceiling as they're on the ice.  Give a little show.  You're watching a hockey game and it's pretty much porn on ice half the time.  Porn on ice.  Taking out of goose pimples.  Right.  Nice.  He's chilly.  So the Islanders kind of came up with this concept and a lot of other teams went with it, of course.  How could he not?  So the Islanders and the Rangers are playing the other night and the Ice Girls come out to do their thing, right?  And what's his name?  Who's the? 
[00:32:00]  Lindquist.  Yeah, Lindquist is in the crease there and he decides he ain't moving for no ice girl.  He ain't moving for the piece of ass.  The cute little Islanders ice girl comes out and he ain't moving.  He ain't moving.  And, you know, she's got to clean out the crease, if you know what I mean.  Of the goal.  Of the goal.  Right, of course.  She has a...  Oh.  She's taking care of anything else before that.  That's the only crease she has to worry about cleaning.  Yeah.  So.  So Lindquist decides, you know what?  F yourself. 
[00:32:30]  The rivalry between the Islanders and Rangers is huge to begin with.  He says, I ain't moving.  And I read in the paper today that it's an NHL rule that the goalie has to leave the crease so they can clean out that area.  But he says, nah, I'm not.  And then he takes his stick and he slashes one of the girls, basically, hitting the broom squeegee thing that she had.  Uh-huh.  And gave her a little welt on her perfect abs.  And it...  A little welt.  So the thing hit her?  Yeah.  What an ass.  And then later on in the game, one of the ice girls is going by the Rangers bench because they clean up that area as well. 
[00:33:00]  Get rid of all the ice chippings.  And, uh...  Gave her a handsome brother's, like, punch in the face.  Might as well have.  One of the Rangers...  Now that would be funny.  One of the Rangers, I wish I knew which one, obviously doesn't like girls because he spit on the hot piece of ass.  Spit on her.  As she's trying to do her job.  What do you mean he doesn't like her?  How do they abuse, like, these girls doing that?  Spit on a couple girls.  So it's a huge story.  And a newspaper we hate reading because it's just a bore fest and it's from our area. 
[00:33:30]  Newsday.  You know what I call it?  Bet you can't guess?  What?  Van?  What?  Snooze Day.  Snooze Day.  This is the...  This...  I would rather read the New York Times Sunday edition cover to cover.  That's a really good paper joke, by the way.  Than this...  For newspaper humor, you can't top that joke.  I don't think you can.  Hey, you could try.  You certainly could try.  I could have went with Boston Globe Sunday edition, too, to make it a little local for Boston today. 
[00:34:00]  Yeah.  See, now they're laughing in Boston because now they understand it.  That's why you have double fans.  All right.  But Newsday has the Rangers versus Isles Ice Girls on the cover.  Yeah.  Just making the Rangers look like, you know, you know.  Bunch of douchebags.  Exactly, Anthony.  That's what they look like.  There's a hot girl.  The picture is great.  There's a hot girl right in front of the goal.  Yeah.  And this stupid goalie is crouched over like an attack position. 
[00:34:30]  Yeah.  What the hell are you thinking?  The best part when the Islanders play other teams, the goalie loses their mind as these  girls are bent.  I mean, because the girls will do everything.  They'll bend over without bending their knees.  They play it up to the crowd right in front of the goalie.  Right in front of the goalie.  And you see some of the goalies just like gulping and just losing their minds.  But I guess Lindquist, you know, this doesn't affect him in any way.  An official has to get between the two of them.  Yeah.  It says, that's cold is the front page.  It says, goalie teammates accused of slashing, cursing, and spitting on the Ice Girls. 
[00:35:00]  What the hell is wrong with them?  That's kind of funny.  Come on.  How could somebody on the phones be defending this action?  Obviously, this transcends being a fan, Sal.  This transcends just being a Ranger fan.  How do you defend that?  Yeah.  How do I defend this?  Yeah.  How do you defend a guy not liking a girl?  No.  I mean, this is why the goalies rough up the crease, you know, for sliding, for stopping the pups on stuffing attempts from behind the net. 
[00:35:30]  Look, these guys are professional athletes, man.  And I want to point them out.  Lindquist never lets these girls in the crease.  Never.  This isn't the first time.  This is the first time he whacked one of the girls.  She might have been in the next way and didn't know the protocol, but he never leaves that crease on a TV timeout.  Now, Sal, I almost saw it Lindquist's way until I read a little bit.  And it's a rule that they have to get out of the crease and let them at least sweep up the little shavings there. 
[00:36:00]  That's true.  I don't know if it's a rule or not in the rule books, but because it's a new thing.  I read it.  It has to be true.  Hey, hey.  Each, you know, they're athletes.  They're egomaniacs in a way.  You know what I mean?  If this guy wants to focus and not let the girl in the crease, so be it.  Right.  And the other guy was Sean Avery, who went over to the crease to help Lindquist out in  the second period after it happened in the first period.  Look, man. 
[00:36:30]  Even if it was an Islander guy, I'm a Ranger fan.  If it was the Islander going to do the same thing, so be it.  That's what he's going to do.  That's what he's going to do.  They have rituals.  They're flips, guys.  You know, they're superstitious, if you will.  Look, hear me out, Sal.  I'm a huge Islander fan.  You're obviously a huge Ranger fan.  Right.  But we're both huge fans of hot high school chicks.  You bet your ass, buddy.  All right.  That's the best thing they could have invented.  I would be going after the Islander goalie if he did the same thing.  Are you kidding me? 
[00:37:00]  Oh, no.  But I just feel, you know, if that's what he's going to do, then let him do what he's  going to do.  They're quirky.  That's how athletes are, you know?  I mean.  All right.  You're listening to Mike and the Mad Dog on the fan.  What do you think about the ice game?  I don't think he should have slashed at the girl.  She's just trying to do a job there, Mikey.  Making a Mad Dog show.  Talking about Lundquist slashing at a girl.  It's preposterous, Mikey.  It's preposterous.  I finally met Mad Dog.  This is a little local.  Met the Mad Dog?  I met him at Joel Highlander's roast. 
[00:37:30]  And it turns out he's the coolest dude, man.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  I think when that happens.  He heard I was there.  He came running over to say hi.  And a big smile on his face.  He seems really cool.  You got to let the girl in a crease.  What do you got to let the girl in a crease?  How would I smell the clay in the crease if you don't let the girl in?  And then slashed it and spit it out of these girls.  It's just preposterous and it's unnecessary.  What do you think of that, Mikey?  At my gym, I jumped on the exercise bike.  And my gym gives you TV, which is nice.  You plug in. 
[00:38:00]  You watch a little TV while you're doing your biking, right?  Unfortunately, they give you 10 channels.  The worst 10 channels on your cable system.  I guess those are the only ones that were willing to give up free cable or something to the gym.  Yeah, to be in an establishment, yeah.  Well, one of them is, yes, or MSN, MSN, MSN, whatever one Mike and the Mad Dog are on.  Mike and the Mad Dog.  So they're on TV as they do their radio show.  And they're actually watching a baseball game pitch by pitch.  And it wasn't even like the Mets. 
[00:38:30]  It wasn't even a local game.  And that was their whole radio show.  What are we going to do today?  Watch a baseball game and comment on pitch by pitch?  Oh, the wind almost took that ball away from them.  Yeah, you're absolutely right, then, Maggie.  Let's look at the next pitch.  Sports radio stinks.  It really – and I'm a big sports fan.  I really am.  I love following the local teams for the most part, okay?  But, man, I tune in the fan here in New York or whatever, another sports station in another city. 
[00:39:00]  After five minutes, you're like, all right, I've got to go find something else.  Yeah, what the hell am I listening to?  They get so deep into stuff to the point, like, who gives a crap if he might have had the flu?  And you're waiting for test results on blah, blah, whatever.  So, what is an ice girl?  The Islanders employ 12 young, hot women who work as a cheerleading squad and grounds crew.  Here's a look at what they do.  Their duties.  Wave flags on ice before games and after Islanders' victories. 
[00:39:30]  Clear ice shavings during breaks in front of team benches and around goals,  which is standard procedure in the NHL,  though not all teams use young, hot women.  Shoot t-shirts into stands from Zamboni and appear during between periods contests.  Shoot t-shirts out of what?  A Zamboni?  Oh.  Or from the Zamboni?  And then what?  And there's an age requirement.  Wait, what was the other rule?  I was thinking.  Shoot t-shirts into stands from Zamboni and appear during between periods contests. 
[00:40:00]  See, that's sexist.  No.  Just because they're on their time doesn't mean that they shouldn't be out there helping out.  Hockey has three.  Oh, see, I thought when they were on their...  Ow!  I thought they were shooting t-shirts out of their Zamboni.  I know what's great about this.  Wow.  Anyway.  Oh, you got...  The age requirement for an ice girl? 
[00:40:30]  Yeah.  The Islanders have decided you can only be hot between the ages of 18 and 26.  That's it, huh?  That's it.  Wow, that is a short, short career.  They have it right there.  Ages 18 to 26.  That's all they want to look at.  Oh, man.  So there's a huge story here in New York.  Made the front page of Newsday, which is such a bore-fest paper.  But there you go.  There you go.  Hey, you want to start a new segment on the Opie and Anthony show?  Uh, yes.  I've been getting these psycho letters from this woman in Brooklyn. 
[00:41:00]  And we've had a laugh in the studio for about a year.  She started writing us since we went back to regular radio.  Who writes?  Yeah, whenever you get a letter, it's like, who does this anymore?  I should have said, who writes letters?  Who puts pen to paper?  But I actually get...  Quill to parchment.  I actually get an old school letter from this nerd.  Someone's broad in Brooklyn.  A messenger runs it here.  With wings on his heels. 
[00:41:30]  He just opened a letter like Karnak.  Okay.  She's reading through the phones.  Anyway, so I read this to the staff, these letters.  You know, get one every 10 days or so.  And we laugh in the office.  Yeah.  Because she's psychotic.  She's psychotic, but she's brilliant at the same time.  Very well written.  Like, I don't mind her as a pen pal. 
[00:42:00]  I just never want to meet her.  Like, there's a fine line here.  Yeah.  Her name is Esther.  And now she's rolling her eyes.  Because I guarantee she listens to every minute of every radio show.  And she's from Brooklyn.  We love your letters.  Esther.  And she even writes...  A little stamp.  Esther.  And instead of the street address, Brooklyn, New York, she writes Esther, her last name.  And instead of the street address, it says, Neighborhood Yenta.  Oh, is she the Neighborhood Yenta?  Yeah.  She writes right there.  You know what?  When you hear this letter, you'll understand what she's all about. 
[00:42:30]  But she probably is.  Like, not just with us like this.  The whole neighborhood.  She's probably just...  Let me tell you about this person.  See the person that lives two doors down there?  Let me tell you about them.  Like, she knows everything that's going on in the neighborhood.  Right.  And just yaps to the other people about it.  He has two little dogs and he never picks up his...  Yeah.  He's the one.  When you see some of that on the sidewalk, that's him.  His dog.  Well, it's a new segment. 
[00:43:00]  A letter from Esther.  It starts off...  Opie.  Love ya.  Love your show.  Very good.  Bill O'Reilly seems to be starting a movement to get a class action lawsuit going against Howard Stern.  She's obsessed with Howard Stern and how awful he is.  Or has become.  You should read it in a Yenta voice.  Who can do the Yenta voice?  You.  I can't do Yenta.  Can you do Yenta?  I can't do Yenta.  And can you do Yenta?  Nah, I'm not really proficient in Yenta.  Love you, love your show. 
[00:43:30]  Bill O'Reilly seems to be starting a movement to get a class action lawsuit going against Howard Stern  for sabotaging American Idol on the grounds that he's willfully and maliciously interfering with their right to sell their product  and causing financial damage to the contestants who are being wrongfully eliminated every week in favor of Sanjaya.  First of all, Bill O'Reilly, do you have to do so much Fox ass kissing?  I mean, obviously that's what that's all about.  He works for Fox, so he wants to, what, get in there? 
[00:44:00]  Nuzzle a little buttocks?  I don't know.  Oh, they're telling us we have to break.  So the letter.  What?  We do.  We're late.  A letter from Esther after the break.  All right.  All right.  Right away.  Well, yeah, we will.  Right away.  Straight away.  And also, after the break, we got the long version of the Fonzie Henry Winkler PSA.  We got the choppy version.  We got the chopped up version?  I knew there was more of that.  We got more, and we're going to be doing that today.  We got Bob Kelly in studio today for Jim Norton. 
[00:44:30]  Jimmy's in Miami.  Miami.  Coconut Grove.  Improv.  All weekend long, starting tonight.  It's Opie and Anthony.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  This week on the Razzle Dazzle Variety Show, it's the Musical Adventure Hour, where you'll  hear one ONA staff member pick the songs while the rest of the staff picks them apart.  On this week's Musical Adventure Hour, E-Rock.  Oh, is this a promo?  I don't know what the fuck it is.  It sounds like it's a promo.  Oh, he's a fucking idiot.  Oh, he's such a fucking idiot. 
[00:45:00]  Oh, wait a minute.  Oh, it's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Lots of great instant feedback coming in.  We got Rob from Alberta.  The Calgary Flames have about six or seven of those ice girls.  All big, nice.  Wait, he writes all big, nice, big boobies.  Oh, boy.  He had to write big twice.  He was so excited.  Big, nice, big, big.  But he writes all big, meaning I'm thinking big girls. 
[00:45:30]  Sounds like big girls.  But it's okay because they got big boobies.  That's how I read this.  Now, that'd be funny, too, though.  But it's probably a typo.  A bunch of fatties come out in, like, little skirts and stuff, and they were the ice girls.  That'd be kind of funny.  They should do that as, like, April Fool's or for Halloween.  I mean, yeah.  See, but the NHL and these teams are too scared to actually make people laugh.  They should do that when the Rangers come back into town and then have the fat chick fight the goalie. 
[00:46:00]  You want to spit on Mays.  Yeah, get just some fat, not even a fat chick, a hot chick that can handle herself.  Like a karate hot chick, and he spits on him.  She lays him out and snaps his arm off.  Spin kicks him to death right in front of everybody.  Anyway, Rob writes, yeah, the Calgary Flames have about six or seven of these ice girls, all big, nice, big boobies.  The best part is watching the visiting goalies trying real hard not to look at them. 
[00:46:30]  That's what I watch, too.  It's hilarious.  The guys see the hot piece of ass right in front of them.  They're like, oh, my God.  I'm in the middle of a game here.  This is killing me.  All distracted.  Yeah.  All right.  A letter from Esther.  Let's get back to this.  So she's been writing these letters, and it's time we bring it to the show because she's just got an interesting take on a lot of things.  She's very intelligent, but she's psychotic.  She has to be.  Who writes an actual letter these days?  She likes to gab.  Yeah.  So it says, Opie, love you, love your show.  Bill O'Reilly seems to be starting a movement to get a class action lawsuit going against Howard Stern for sabotaging American Idol on the grounds that he's willfully and maliciously interfering with their right to sell their product and causing financial damage to the contestants who are being wrongfully eliminated every week in favor of Sanjaya. 
[00:47:00]  I actually saw this on Bill O'Reilly last week.  It was such a waste of time, a non-story.  They got some dumb lawyer brought on there to discuss if this is even possible.  It's not.  Bill O'Reilly stinks. 
[00:47:30]  You can't sue someone for encouraging listeners to vote for somebody on a reality show.  If they were to sue him, he's dead because he's all over the media bragging and boasting that he's responsible for instigating millions of votes for Sanjaya because he wants to ruin the show.  He's not having an effect on the voting, by the way.  No.  The main guy from American Idol was in the paper yesterday saying it's impossible.  Yeah.  There's millions, millions and millions of people.  Well, I think they said 32 million people voted for last night's results. 
[00:48:00]  And I'm sure you know by now Sanjaya made it through again.  He wasn't even in the bottom three.  They got rid of the rocker chick.  And like we said yesterday, do the Howie – well, Howie likes to do Howie math.  And we say do the regular math.  Just do a simple math problem and you'll realize it's impossible.  He cannot control the results of American Idol.  He doesn't have contact with the amount of people it would take to sway that vote. 
[00:48:30]  Right.  Just doesn't.  He doesn't talk to enough people.  And the media has got to wake up and write that.  Just do the math yourself.  It's impossible.  Dude, they don't do their research.  They just don't do any research.  They hear something and they jump on it without doing any research whatsoever.  For example, the Keith Richards thing.  Yeah.  They all look like idiots today.  Yeah.  Because Keith's like, look, man, I said that in jest.  Joking that I snorted my dead father's ashes.  And they threw it on their front pages yesterday. 
[00:49:00]  Later on, barely later on, like when we got in, we already had an update saying no.  It wasn't true.  He said to some magazine just as kind of a joke.  Since it's Keith Richards, you know, you think it's outrageous that it could possibly happen.  And when you hear it, yeah, it could.  But then he comes out and says, no, he's joking.  I know why the papers don't do their research because it doesn't make for a good story if it's not true.  Yeah.  If it's not true, they can't print it.  And it's a sensational story.  So they want it printed.  So why check the facts?  Look, we understand what's going on.  They want to sell papers and a headline on the front page that says, I snorted my dead dad. 
[00:49:30]  Yeah.  I mean, that's going to make you buy the paper that day.  Right.  Same thing with this Howard crap and him doing his Howie math.  They know it's not true, but it makes for a good story.  Sells papers.  So anyway, he wants to ruin the show.  And if he denies it, he has to admit that he's okay for instigating millions of votes for Sanjaya because he wants to ruin the show.  And if he denies it, he has to admit that he's a liar, that he's lying about the amount of listeners and power he has because he's so desperate for publicity and attention. 
[00:50:00]  And then she writes, which brings me to this, Esther writes.  Another point.  You should start a class action lawsuit.  That was her setup.  You should start a class action lawsuit against Stern for being a fraud on the grounds of the following.  It said in Cindy Adams column that Stern emailed Barbara Walters to thank her for having his princess on the view.  And to tell her, Beth got such tremendous feedback on her appearance. 
[00:50:30]  And then she writes in parentheses, from who?  Her mommy and daddy?  This guy who conned millions of people into buying satellite radio, claiming he was such a wild man and was going to have a revolution on the radio, is such an effing putz.  He's like a Yiddish bubby.  A Yiddish bubby?  Or bubby.  Convelling over and doting?  And doting on a daughter.  Convelling to all the old yentas and nanas. 
[00:51:00]  About what?  Nanas.  An old nana.  About what a lovely young lady and how well brought up and respectful to her elders his princess is.  Humiliating the poor kid in front of all her friends with his lame, putzy, nebbishy, schmaltzy behavior.  Except, of course, Beth isn't humiliated because she's such a nerdy, dorky, goody two-shoes herself.  And she's so disturbingly infantile for a 34-year-old woman. 
[00:51:30]  And she underlines that a bunch of times.  The 34-year-old woman.  Right.  She loves having Howie baby her and cavell over her like a doting Jewish father.  Maybe if Howard doted over his real daughters, not this overgrown 34-year-old infant, they wouldn't be the troubled messes that they're all said to be.  Wow.  So I say his listeners should band together and sue him for being a fraud, a phony, a fake, a poser, a liar. 
[00:52:00]  Your fan, Esther, from Brooklyn.  And then she writes, turnover.  Oh, okay.  Page four.  Page four.  It's all handwritten, double-spaced.  That was a Paul Harvey joke, by the way.  That was really good for the old-school radio listeners.  I also noticed that Beth, who looks like she was born to the same whore Sarah Silverman was born to, is taken...  Jesus, Sarah's not...  Sarah's pretty.  I'm just reading this.  You call the horse. 
[00:52:30]  I think Sarah's cute.  I think Sarah's sexy.  I'm just reading.  I'm not editorializing at all here today.  I'm just reading Esther's letter from Brooklyn.  It's Esther's letter.  All right.  Don't get pissed at me.  Because I know now the Howie fans will call that crazy.  I'm just reading a letter from Esther.  It's our new bit.  I also noticed that Beth, who looks like she was born to the same whore Sarah Silverman was born to...  It's the way you say whore.  ...has taken on a lot of Sarah's facial expressions and gestures and ways, probably because she and Howie are said to spend so much time with Jimmy Kimmel and Sarah Silverman. 
[00:53:00]  And Beth has no mind or personality of her own.  She probably thinks she's much prettier than Sarah because she's blonde and blue-eyed.  But she's not.  They're identical horses.  Jesus.  There's your letter from Esther this morning, our new bit.  You're going to get some Jewish music in the back, like an oud playing in the background.  How do you even know that?  An oud?  Because it looks like my stomach. 
[00:53:30]  An oud.  What is an oud?  An oud.  It's a Jewish guitar.  Ew.  It's like a little baby, little fat round guitar.  So there you go.  All right.  I like Esther.  You like the Esther?  Yeah.  She's got spunk.  I worked at a Jewish foster camp.  That's why.  Huh?  I was a lifeguard at a Jewish foster camp for a summer.  Foster camp?  Not foster camp.  What do they call those things?  Concentration camp?  Oh, man.  No.  Jesus, Anthony.  No.  Where does she work?  At a camp. 
[00:54:00]  Like one of those summer...  You know Jewish kids go to camp every summer.  Jewish camp?  They send them away.  It's called Jewish camp.  We go to the park and hang out on a, you know, like a swing, and then they send these guys  away to do archery and play tennis.  Oh, and ride horses and things like that?  Color wars.  No horses.  Jesus.  No?  No, not a horse.  But I was a lifeguard for Jewish kids.  A lifeguard?  Yeah.  I was a lifeguard.  I have a picture.  I was gorgeous at hand.  I swear to God.  I know.  We woke you up this morning.  Nice talking to you. 
[00:54:30]  Hey, it was your idea to wake up the hot chicks that are now messes.  I actually dated a hot chick who was a fat chick model.  Yeah?  Yeah, and she was so gorgeous.  Her face was unbelievable.  It's always the face.  What a pretty face.  I used to hide the rest of her body with king-sized pillows.  Yeah, the girl that did the commercial with us.  Yeah, she was hot.  She's a big gal.  She's hot. 
[00:55:00]  She's a big model.  And very pretty.  Yeah.  But, you know, big girl.  Yeah.  But I don't think she'd be as hot as she was thin, though.  I think she...  There's some girls that are fat that look better fat.  And then if they lose the weight, it's like...  Yeah, then all of a sudden their face drops or something.  It doesn't work.  Their hotness or cuteness.  The girl that did our commercial, I mean, she was a big girl, but she was beautiful.  She was beautiful, man.  She's beautiful fat.  But if she lost the weight, she'd...  But it's okay to be fat when you're younger, because everything smells right. 
[00:55:30]  What?  Love to hear the...  Think about that one later today.  The logic behind that one, but...  When you get older and you're fat, it starts smelling differently.  But everyone, you know, everyone in general, when you're younger, you just smell right.  So when you're older and fat, you smell different?  Oh, my God, yeah.  What, like old bread?  What?  Just think of the most horrific thing.  I would think.  I think Hope's got a point here.  Like snake crap?  Yeah, like it's just... 
[00:56:00]  It's been covered up by rolls for too long.  Like just festering.  No, I mean, you buy anything new, it smells good.  Think about it.  I'm in an older car right now.  Right.  It smells.  Doesn't have that new car smell.  It just smells.  It's got the smell of everything that's been going on there for years.  You're a young girl.  You get a nice new car smell.  New car smell.  Dude, human beings, same thing.  So you're saying...  We're all going to end up smelling horribly eventually. 
[00:56:30]  Old fat chicks need that little Christmas tree air freshener around their neck.  All I'm saying is...  You need to be detailed by Mexicans when you're 35.  All I'm saying is, like, you look past the fatness because the smell's all right.  It smells all right.  Oh, when you're younger, a fat chick is okay because she doesn't smell bad.  Right.  But when she's older, her belly button tends to stink a little.  Yeah.  Because...  And before you call up all pissed off because you're one of these fatties, we're all going 
[00:57:00]  to smell bad eventually.  Right.  Because the age thing makes us all just start smelling...  When you're going to dump it in your pants.  The old people...  Why do old people smell?  I went over this yesterday because they're already dying.  They're dying.  What do you mean they're dying?  You don't just die as one unit.  Dr. O'Brien had a theory yesterday that is being now accepted by the medical community.  Really?  If you're unfortunate to go out in, like, some horrific way and your whole body dies at once,  that's one thing.  Right.  But if you end up living a long time, your body has already started dying. 
[00:57:30]  So that's like...  There's certain restaurants that you go to, it just smells like old people?  Yeah.  Because old people frequent that place?  Yeah.  And that is just death in the air?  Is that what you're saying?  Parts of their body are officially dead.  Like their armpits are dying?  Whatever.  I don't know.  A layer of skin, a hair follicle.  A couple of fingers, nails, nail beds.  A scientist?  I don't know.  Things like that.  They just die in pieces.  I tried to be a nice guy once in a movie theater when I used to have to go to the movies. 
[00:58:00]  Yeah.  And there was an old woman in a wheelchair.  And, you know, the movie theater kind of slopes up toward the back.  The movie's over.  And she's kind of blocking everybody.  So it was kind of a, you know, two things.  I wanted to get the hell out of there.  And I figured I'd be a nice guy.  So I'll push her wheelchair up the ramp.  So I said, I'll give you a hand here.  Oh, I know where you're going with this.  So I go to push her.  And now think about this.  When you're pushing a wheelchair, where is, what's directly under your nose? 
[00:58:30]  If you draw a line from your nostrils and hang a plumb bob directly from your nostrils down, where is it going to intersect?  With their ass.  Exactly.  They're sitting in that chair.  I smelt this old woman's, I guess, whatever was going on.  Diaper.  It could have been a diaper.  It could have been just, you know, that she was having issues sitting through such a long movie. 
[00:59:00]  It smelt like both types of waste as I was pushing her up this aisle.  And my eyes were watering.  And I got her right to the top and just kind of rolled her to the side.  It smells like ammonia.  And walked away.  Yeah.  It was ammonia.  Ammonia and some kind of rotting food product.  And a baby that needed it changing.  Old people do not.  This is a fact.  My mother is a hairdresser.  And she did, like, old women for five years.  She just worked at the salon.  It was just all old women. 
[00:59:30]  And they don't get their hair cut.  They get it done.  Done.  So, like, they can't shower.  They can't afford to.  When you get your hair done, you don't shower.  You put a little thing on it.  And then you, you know.  Right.  So they're.  You take little bird baths.  Exactly.  Flutter, flutter in the water.  I'm done.  A little powder.  Pass me a face cloth.  I got to wipe down my pits.  Get me the Johnson & Johnson powder.  She used to have to wash their hair with dishwashing detergent. 
[01:00:00]  To work up any kind of lather.  No, because the scalp was so greasy.  I'm not even kidding you, dude.  They had to use palm, like, that, you know, the stuff you wash your dishes with.  Wow.  To cut through the grease on their head.  Like, I was in there one day and this lady walked in.  She's like, listen, scrub my head like you hate my guts, Kathy.  Because their hair, they don't shower.  Yeah.  Like, my, my nan, my nana.  Yeah.  She used to, my mother, my father's mother.  She used to go to the parlor.  I'm going to the parlor. 
[01:00:30]  She had to tell everybody on Saturday.  She would get every other Saturday.  Yeah.  Pretty much two weeks.  I'm going to the parlor.  And she'd have her hair done in this giant bouffant.  It was this puffy, fluff thing that would stick up two feet above her head.  It was a Marge Simpson do.  And she would spray the crap out of it with just wonderful hairspray in the can.  I'm going to the wonderful hair.  My nana is, like, she alone is responsible for the hole in the ozone layer. 
[01:01:00]  She would spray this thing down to where it was like Kevlar.  You couldn't, and we used to, like, we were kids,  so we'd touch a hair and go, you know, why is your hair hard?  What are you doing to the, oh, I just got back from the parlor?  Yeah.  It's like, and you grow up and start thinking, how did they wash that?  Old people don't shower.  Yeah.  No, they shower.  I get dizzy.  I get the vertigo.  They do shower.  It's just that, you know, the death process has begun. 
[01:01:30]  My grandfather wakes and goes.  I talked to him.  Rotting.  Huh?  My grandfather wakes.  He's 96.  He wakes up and goes.  Here's another story about 96.  He still drives.  And I'll tell you this.  And they just make, they don't even, like, his shoelaces came undone.  He just taped them.  He put tape on them.  His glasses broke.  He got, like, a paper clip and fixed it.  So he's walking.  He had a tie.  We went out to dinner.  His tie was rope. 
[01:02:00]  I'm not even kidding you, dude.  Come on.  Dude, I'm not kidding you.  He had a rope tie to keep, because the button on the shirt was gone.  And instead of just getting a shirt, you know, that had a new button, he just got a piece  of rope and tied it around his neck and made a little tie.  He had tape on his shoe.  And he just goes.  He knows he's dying.  And he doesn't shower either.  Hey, I'm going to try the blank game again.  Yesterday, we failed miserably.  We're going to try again today, though.  Don't explain anything.  I'm just going to read this as a blank thing, and then you do the fill-in at home. 
[01:02:30]  The Gooch from Cleveland.  My buddy's a dentist.  He was working on an old lady, and she blanked her pants in the chair.  Maybe?  Yeah, I think he got through.  Then blanked and smeared blank down the hallway to the blank.  I don't know about that, but we'll see what he does.  The last blank I kept out, too.  Yeah, but I think you got a little descriptive there, which made it a little easier to...  Thank you, Bob.  The word sneer.  I'm trying to keep saying it, Bob.  Sorry.  Jesus Christ. 
[01:03:00]  I thought you wanted me to keep saying that.  I respect you, Anthony.  I just do what you tell me to do.  So you say the word, like, three more times.  I don't go against you.  You help my self-esteem.  You make me feel good.  You say, thanks, Bob.  Apparently, E-Rock was giving the thumbs up, but until him.  Oh, Bob, you blew it.  See?  I got it through.  You said it too many times.  It wasn't meant to be.  That's what that means.  It wasn't meant to be.  No, man.  It wasn't meant to be.  That's a great line by the Gooch.  You effed Gooch today.  I'm sorry, Gooch. 
[01:03:30]  There's a way to do...  You took away half his audience for his good line.  The X-Amers heard it.  The rest of the people did it, and Gooch was going to become a huge star there from that  line.  It wasn't meant to be Gooch.  All right.  Let's go to Jack in Chicago listening on WCKG.  Jack, what's going on?  Good morning.  105.9.  WCKG is happy to have Opie and Anthony and Bob Kelly on this morning.  Look at that, man.  Did the screener tell you to say that?  Look at Jack supporting the local station.  Thank you, Jack.  You got to love it.  I told my wife we're going to the virus, even if it's only us two.  Just kidding. 
[01:04:00]  Look, that would have hurt about three months ago, but the last four months, we've seen  nothing but a little tick up in the ratings.  A little tick, a little tick, a little tick.  We need about another 10 of these ticks, by the way, for people to really take notice,  but we're noticing.  Go ahead, Jack.  You guys are going to clean house here.  Chicago's a wasteland, the radio.  But listen, the old folks, yeah, they do have that problem with the odor and stuff like  that.  But you got to imagine that Jimmy Norton is pretty young, and he stinks really bad, too. 
[01:04:30]  So I think the old folks have just got a lot of love in their heart, you know?  Well, Jack was going to say, but he blew it.  Old people smell, but they love you so much that it's okay.  They love you so much.  The love that comes out of their smelly bodies.  There's such a comfort.  Stinky grandmas and grandpas love you.  Yeah, but the fact now that every time I smell that, I'm going to think of death.  There's just this lady dying next to me. 
[01:05:00]  They're just decomposing.  Her cells disintegrating.  Blowing away up your nostrils.  Yeah, that'd be like...  Some stinky decomposition.  The movie where it just microscopes in on her shoulder, and it's actually fizzing away  in the wind.  Oh!  And it's going into my nose, and I'm eating it.  Oh!  Let's say...  Disgusting.  Let's say hi to Chris in Pennsylvania.  Chris, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Love you.  Love the show.  Oh, thank you, Chris.  Thank you.  When my grandparents would come over, they'd just sit there like grandparents do, and when 
[01:05:30]  you walk in the house, it smelled like my mom had a can of tuna laying out for weeks.  What?  What?  They'd come over, they'd have to wash the sheets like three times to get the smell out  when they'd spend the night.  It was the most horrific thing in the world.  They, like, give up, I guess.  I guess they give up.  They just give up.  You know, it's an effort for old people.  You see old people walking down the street.  You ever see the 90-degree person where they're bent at the hips at 90 degrees?  Yeah.  And they're walking down the sidewalk with a cane, and, like, they got some kind of calcium 
[01:06:00]  problem, so they're bent over, and it takes them forever to walk from one corner to another,  and you're just looking going, oh, my God.  And you realize, if they can't do that, they aren't sitting there in the shower throwing  their head back, shampoo.  You know how, like, you shampoo and you wash with gusto when you're younger?  You're like, everything's flying.  Water's all over the place.  Soap's on the ceiling of the shower.  It looks like your own personal car wash. 
[01:06:30]  You got time to crank one?  You're like, there's plenty of energy and time for everything.  You're going wild.  That's what, like, it is to shower when you're young.  You're washing the middle of your back because you can.  Yeah.  You can reach around and hit every part of your body.  You're like a cat.  Under carriage.  You're like a cat.  You could lick your own, like, spine.  Yeah, yeah.  It doesn't matter.  You go, wham, I'm washing.  I'm washing.  Hands flying.  And then all people, what the hell can they do? 
[01:07:00]  They're sitting there just, I'll wash my hands.  Great.  But where are they going to?  They're going to see you.  My grandfather's going in the basement every day.  He's sitting in the chair.  He's getting used to underground.  Yeah.  Because that's where he's going to be soon.  I swear to God.  He just goes in the basement every day.  I'm going to take a shower to go sit in the basement and then have lunch with that woman  I've been with for 50 years and then go back to the basement and then come back up  and have some type of vegetable with a meat and then go back to the basement. 
[01:07:30]  You know, I never thought of why they give up, but they do give up.  They give up.  Whether it's physical or something.  I don't know.  Why go get shoelaces?  Just get tape.  It may be today.  It may be over today.  I already go down, I get the shoelaces, I put them in, then I die.  Forget it.  And you could shower in like four minutes.  I can shower in like four minutes if I have to.  I do it every morning.  And just, and I mean, not a half-assed shower.  I'm talking, you know, you're cleaning everything. 
[01:08:00]  Speed shower.  But it's, you know, you're working in there.  Yeah.  You feel it.  When you get out, you feel like you're worked out.  You know?  That's taking a shower.  My new shower that I have, I put a bench in so you can sit down.  Oh, see, that's the beginning of the end, though.  Yeah.  Beginning of the end.  If you walk into a shower and there's one of those metal stools in there.  No, I have a whole, you can lie down.  Stop it, Bobby.  You have the shower tiles.  Bobby, stand up.  No.  Stand up in the shower.  What are you doing with it sitting in a seat? 
[01:08:30]  I want to lie down and invite other men over.  You guys can come over and take a shower if you want.  You want to shower with me?  Come on, man.  I love to shower with Anthony.  Wash your back.  Yeah, you're sitting there talking.  You're an old geisha girl.  Dude, so what are you doing this weekend?  I don't know.  I was going to put a little poker.  Pass the soap over there.  You're going to bother your shower.  Yeah, we'd have to have like a regular conversation.  Hope comes in and uses the middle shower, though.  He uses like the rainfall shower while we're sitting.  That would be nice.  Talking.  A little rainfall shower.  I like that.  Want to get my back? 
[01:09:00]  Sure.  Let's wash old people.  Let's have, instead of a car wash to raise money, we're going to have like a wash old  people to raise money.  Oh, my God.  If we could pull that off.  Scrub them down.  Yeah, we'll just have, as they're walking down the street, we grab them and scrub them  down with baby wipes.  And I want one of those big like sponges that you wash your car with.  Yeah.  Just all soaped up and you give them speed things.  Shove them off to the next person, hose them down like out of Pulp Fiction.  Yeah.  We'll all dress like pimps from the 70s. 
[01:09:30]  Like car wash.  Young high school girls got to be in there.  Yeah.  Yeah, that always helps.  But those girls know how to wash cars, don't they?  We're heading quickly toward a break.  Can I play one of our favorite things?  Bill?  Bill?  Speaking of old people, you want to set this up there?  Poor elderly woman.  Well, she called up.  She thought she was calling her friend's house, getting in touch with her friend.  Opie answers and doesn't let her off the hook. 
[01:10:00]  He tells her something awful happened to her friend, Bill.  Hello?  Hi.  Hi.  Bill.  Who's this?  Pat.  Hi, Pat.  How are you?  Now, this is the wrong Bill.  Well, Pat, I have some bad news.  What?  Bill died today.  Your kid?  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  It's tragic.  Who's this?  He was in a car accident today. 
[01:10:30]  Oh, no.  Who is this?  It's John.  John?  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  Oh, my God.  I don't believe it.  Yeah.  I was just talking to him.  I know.  Where did it happen?  This afternoon.  Where?  On the highway.  Oh, God love him. 
[01:11:00]  Yeah.  Big, big, big pile up.  Well, be sure and give the kids my condolences.  Okay.  Well, I gotta go.  All right, John.  All right.  Thanks.  Bye.  Bye.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  That's right.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony Show.  Bob Kelly in studio today.  Bob, I hung up on a guy that said you killed in Cleveland. 
[01:11:30]  Cleveland was, I was surprisingly fantastic.  Oh.  But we're so busy that we have to kind of hang up on people.  If you're on hold and all of a sudden the phone hangs up, that's us just trying to move on as quickly as possible.  We have no time to be polite with this radio show.  We're trying to get to some stuff.  But he said you killed in Cleveland.  Sorry.  Are you promoting anything, Bob?  No.  Just doing the virus show in two weeks.  Well, a week and a half, right?  Ten days?  Something like that?  Yeah.  Excellent.  Nine days in Vegas.  Hot Rock Live. 
[01:12:00]  April 14th.  We've got eight or nine comedians.  All the info is on our website.  You can get tickets through Ticketmaster.  And then we're doing a press conference by the pool in the afternoon.  We invite all the listeners to check that out.  And we'll announce the other stops on the old tour.  Okay?  Hey, Dave in Boston.  He writes, hi, guys.  Love you.  Love the show.  What the hell is wrong with you three?  You went from talking about hot ice chicks to hot chicks that fell apart to old poopy pants  women with Hevlar hair.  And then he writes in huge letters, also known as caps. 
[01:12:30]  Yelling.  Boobs.  Hot chicks.  Fast cars.  Focus.  Focus.  Yeah, we have a problem focusing.  We certainly do.  What else is America talking about this morning?  Let us know.  We want you to feel like this is the show to tune in in the morning to get, like, basic info.  You'll get all the big stories.  And the rest of this stuff, bah, who cares?  See, if we're...  A big event isn't going to happen and we're not going to talk about it right away, you 
[01:13:00]  know.  Well, we're learning as we do this morning thing.  We were afternoon drive guys.  It's a different feel in the morning.  We're learning that some of you asses have to make sure the world didn't blow up overnight.  Yeah.  So trust me, if the world blew up overnight, we're going to tell you.  If we're talking about old people and crap like that, that means it's a slow news day  and then you get to see our real talent making crap up on the spot.  Yapping about nothing.  Just winging it.  Who else?  Right around 710 went, oh my God, we have nothing to talk about for the next 10 minutes. 
[01:13:30]  And look, we pulled it out of our you-know-whats.  But America's talking about the Keith Richards thing.  He's denying snorting his dad's ashes, said he ground it up with some coke.  Right.  He was cremated, took some ashes, mixed it in with some coke, and snorted it.  That's what he said.  And he said he was just, he was only joking.  He was only joking.  So that supposedly did not happen, even though all the front pages went with it yesterday.  Was that supposed to be some kind of sick joke?  Apparently so. 
[01:14:00]  And Nicole, God, enough with her, but new information today.  Anyway, she took 600 pills in the final weeks of her life.  She had 11 prescriptions when she died that she was taking.  All the prescriptions, less than five weeks old, by the way.  I'll tell you that guy.  Really?  Yeah.  That guy killed her.  The lawyer, her friend killed the son, killed her.  He's trying to get that money.  Look at you.  He's got the baby.  He's going to get the baby.  He's probably his son.  He's going to get the rights.  The kid's going to get all the money.  He's going to get all the money because of the kid. 
[01:14:30]  I'm the perfect plan.  I said it right now.  I said it right now.  First, you have to get rid of the son.  And then Columbo's going to come in and solve the case.  Then you have to, yeah.  He's going to solve the case.  You die.  Pop an eye out.  Throw it at his head.  Are you trying to set Anthony up?  He was.  You were.  He's trying to set me up for a Columbo bit.  What does that mean?  And he went, he just brushed his side.  The aunt goes, I ain't doing Columbo.  I don't feel like doing Columbo.  Like, unbelievable.  I didn't know it did Columbo.  You do Columbo?  Of course. 
[01:15:00]  Who doesn't?  I don't.  Opie doesn't.  Yeah, I do.  Van does it.  You do Columbo?  Everyone does it, Columbo.  I'm really good at it, actually.  Oh, I didn't know that.  I thought you did the.  And then Sanjaya did not get kicked off Idol last night.  Of course not.  Didn't even have to watch the whole show to sing it.  And I don't know about your paper, but our paper, even though the rocker chick got kicked  off the headlines about Sanjaya and a big picture of him, that's why he continues on American  Idol.  He's his own sensation.  Yeah.  He's a marketing genius, that kid.  Did you see his little dirty fingernails last night? 
[01:15:30]  No.  If you have a...  Oh.  Oh.  They had a close-up of him at the end when she got kicked off.  And I T-voted and I froze it with his little cute fingers on his face.  And he has dirty fingernails?  Dirty, long, Indian fingernails.  What happened there?  They're long?  Yeah.  Well, they're long for a guy where you can see the white and then the dirt.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  It looks like he has a French manicure.  Maybe he just has a French manicure.  I don't know.  There's something going on with that guy. 
[01:16:00]  He wasn't even in the bottom three.  You didn't have to wait until the end of the show to see who was kicked off.  I watched up until they took his group of three and said, you guys are safe.  You could sit down and then click.  I haven't watched the show.  That was the first time I even watched a piece of that show since the auditions.  I care less about this season.  He's keeping this season alive because it's a bunch of who gives a craps.  Who cares?  Right.  There's no Chris Daughtry this year or Taylor Hicks that was kind of...  No standout weird personality things. 
[01:16:30]  Kelly Pickler.  You remember all the names.  They all had their own personalities.  I couldn't tell you a name or anything.  I know Melinda Doolittle.  She has no neck.  She's an unbelievable singer, but she's ugly as sin, and there's no way they're going to  be able to market her.  Is she the one that looks like...  And that's why she has been a backup singer for the last 10 years.  Patrice calls her Shrek.  Does she look like Earl?  I said, because we call Earl Shrek, and she looks like Black Earl.  She looks like a female Black Shrek.  Earl.  Yeah. 
[01:17:00]  Absolutely.  So what else is people talking about?  Oh, Bonds.  He hit a homer yesterday.  He's 21 away from Hank Aaron.  And the Masters start...  Well, hey, Tennessee beats Rutgers for the NCAA Women's Basketball Championship.  See, that's what all the guys that are into basketball watch, is the women's basketball.  I was just in Cleveland and stayed in the hotel that the Tennessee women's team was in,  the Wyndham.  Well, I was there all week.  They were there.  They were just a bunch of, you know, white, short-haired women with parted to the side 
[01:17:30]  and these tall, sexy, black athletes.  Oh.  Really?  Oh, they're hot.  They're kind of manly, dude.  I don't know.  This is what happens.  If you see them in the afternoon, you're like, oh my God, very manly.  But at night, when they get dolled up and they do the hair and they fizz it out and put  some lipstick on, a little mascara and some tight jeans.  What's going on with that?  What do you mean?  That's why they all turned lesbo.  Who the hell is going to go out with that?  They all have the same guy, though. 
[01:18:00]  If you look at these athletes, they have a woman guy.  Oh, really?  He's not manly.  He's not...  He's kind of like...  He's like, you know, talking on the elevator.  She's not talking.  He's the one, hey, so we'll go here and blah, blah, blah.  And she's like, yeah, whatever.  It would have to be because a manly guy wouldn't want to be overshadowed by a manlier girl.  So you need a guy on the other end of the spectrum, the femme.  Yeah.  Can you go out with a woman that's taller than you?  Absolutely.  I would love to go out with one of those basketball.  There's just something about that. 
[01:18:30]  Really?  Yeah.  And I'm not sure, but I got a tall girlfriend.  And when she puts the heels on, it gets really close where I have to go back into the apartment  and go get my brand new shoes with a little heel on them.  You're not wearing, like, flat sneakers or...  No.  I'm always paying attention to see what she's throwing on her feet because if she throws  a heel on, it's a little too close for comfort.  And in my...  I just can't see...  Some guys can do it.  I saw a couple the other day. 
[01:19:00]  The guy was maybe 5'6", and his chick was easily 5'10".  I'm like, how do you do that?  I'd love to be picked up by a tall black basketball player.  Really?  Yeah, just...  And you're not talking female, by the way.  Just to stand on my...  I want to stand on my tippy toes to kiss.  Oh, God.  You know...  All right.  Like George Costanza.  I want to be with a giant.  I want to be with a giant woman.  Also, here's your news.  So you know, the world hasn't blown up.  We got the... 
[01:19:30]  Iran obviously freed all the hostages.  I saw that.  Yeah.  They're saying strong possibility gas may hit $4 this summer.  No.  $4?  I don't know.  I'm just saying that.  Why would it go that high if tensions have eased since they let the Brits go?  Ah, they'll be...  Which, by the way, that was the biggest, like, ass kiss fest I've ever seen.  The president of Iran comes out.  I would love to say his name, but who can? 
[01:20:00]  He comes walking out, gives a speech, and then he's meeting with the...  What they were.  We're hostages.  He's meeting with them, and they're kissing his ass.  Thank you so much for your hospitality and blah, blah, blah.  And then Tony Blair is talking, thankful, everything.  That buddy's talking about how we want to work with the Iranian government, and this little  dictator is walking around, and now he looks like a good guy.  He took 15 soldiers hostage, and he looks like the good guy that freed the people. 
[01:20:30]  If you were in that situation, you would be kissing everyone's butt until they said,  we are now landing at JFK Airport, and then you can start your cursing, and...  Those bastards.  You know, we'll be baking cakes today.  Whatever it takes to get out of that.  Let me just put a little realism into this whole thing.  There's no way you get 15 soldiers that will get in front of a video camera and say that 
[01:21:00]  what they were doing is wrong if they're just asked nicely.  It doesn't happen.  You don't get 15 of them that sit there and go, we shouldn't be in Iraq.  We definitely should let them do what they want.  We've been treated great here in Iran.  We love the Iranian people.  The government has been great to us.  They don't just say, hey, dude, I'm going to roll camera.  Could you just, like, talk us up?  Oh, yeah, fine.  I'm a soldier.  I've been trained not to do this.  I love my country.  I fight for my country. 
[01:21:30]  I was willing to die for it and do that.  But, yeah, I'll do it.  You don't think they roughed them up or threatened their lives to make 15 of them all do that?  Of course they did.  I would have my fingers crossed so I could save face at the local pub.  My fingers were crossed.  Hey, look, look at the video.  My fingers were crossed.  They don't know about that over there.  You look at the old NOM videos.  Look at some of the old NOM videos of the confessions that they got on film and still pictures.  And you'll see some guys standing there and just showing their middle finger. 
[01:22:00]  Like, they'll have their hand on their legs.  And one handle, all the fingers will be curled up except for the middle one, which is kind of like, you know, hey, could you look at this hand here?  I'm kind of giving the old F you to these guys.  And, you know, I didn't notice any signals or anything.  But there's no way they are just asked nicely and they do this.  The one British soldier they showed over and over again.  The woman or the guy.  He was a little too happy.  I think that was his signal.  Like, look, everyone that knows me knows I'm never this happy. 
[01:22:30]  Miserable guy.  See, they were doing the opposite, right?  He's probably a miserable F.  And he goes, look, this is how I'll save face with my friends and family.  Look at the video.  Have you ever seen me this happy?  I've seen him smile since he was eight years old.  Right.  And he's just yucking it up, pointing at maps.  We were here.  Yeah, we're in the wrong.  He hates pita bread.  Can I go home now?  He hates pita bread, but he's just chowing it down.  Oh, yeah.  Even a falafel.  Hey, before we move on from Idol, because a lot of people do watch the Idol, yes, let's acknowledge that Haley's dress was ridiculous last night. 
[01:23:00]  Oh, didn't see it.  Nothing but boobs and legs.  I don't even know.  I don't even know if she could sing.  I have no clue, but she's through it in the next round, thank God.  Because she's starting to use her body.  They're all doing little subtle things to stay on the show.  Try to get a little more than just their singing in there.  Well, her skirt or her dress is getting shorter as the weeks go on.  Look, I know there's women that have more talent than me, but they don't have these legs, so I better show them off now.  The only thing that bugs me about her is that mole. 
[01:23:30]  Yeah, man.  A mole can wreck everything.  It's risen.  Right.  When I go to kiss you, and then my tongue kind of, you know when your tongue kind of ventures out of the mouth?  Right.  And then you feel like a lump, and it goes over like a bump.  That's why that whole Cindy Crawford thing was never sexy to me.  It's like Cindy Crawford's famous mole.  And at first it starts out like, I guess, a beauty mark where it's flat against the skin.  And then now, it's like the Wicked Witch. 
[01:24:00]  Yeah.  It's got like three hairs growing out of it.  My girl used to have one right on her nose, and she got it removed.  Yeah.  Yeah, I never said anything when I met her.  You know, I kind of broke up with her after.  It was like 10 years ago.  But then when she got it removed, I was like, thank God.  Thank God.  You know?  I mean, because it gets cancerous.  I mean, you're going to have to get this stuff removed.  It turns into cancer when you're around, you know, 70.  Jeez.  But I know I had like, when I was growing up, I had a little, like a beauty mark. 
[01:24:30]  It's called little, like a freckly thing on my neck.  Why do they call them beauty marks, by the way?  There's nothing beautiful about those marks.  They used to call it that, I guess, in the oldie days where they would pencil in like, oh, yes.  Like the French would do that too.  Uh-huh.  And they'd put a little mole on their cheek, something like that.  But I had one on my neck, and as I was getting older, this is a few years back, I was getting  older, I noticed it like pulling away.  It started pulling away from the skin, like it was growing into what would have turned 
[01:25:00]  into a mole.  A skin tag.  Or something like that.  We call it a skin tag.  Well, let me tell you, my friend.  Yeah?  Clip, clip.  The old nail clippers came out.  You did your own story.  I just, bam, knocked it right off.  Went away.  You know what?  We got to, we got to, sorry, are you done?  Oh, I've healed.  I apologize.  It was fine.  Bled a little bit, and then it just went completely away.  We got to have an intervention. 
[01:25:30]  Five, six years ago.  We got to have an intervention with my brother, Brett.  You know, one of the owners of FH Riley's, 400 New York Avenue in the heart of Huntington  Village.  We're all going to be there, what, Saturday?  Saturday.  Who's playing?  It's, um.  I know it's Fat Opie's band that he put together, The Art of the Topless.  Yeah, The Art of the Topless.  Performing at 10 p.m. at my restaurant with my brothers.  I'm just a silent partner, but my brother just works his ass off.  FH Riley's.  They're going to play for two hours.  Music related to the Opie and Anthony and Ron and Fez show. 
[01:26:00]  Yeah, a lot of the songs, the parody songs you hear on each of the shows and things like  that.  So we'll see you Saturday.  It's, uh, the 400 New York Avenue in Huntington Village out there in Long Island.  But we got to have an intervention with him because he does his own surgery.  What?  What?  Well, there's, there's like classifications.  With what?  He's taking a nail clipper to a skin tag is one thing.  Oh, dude.  He does all sorts of stuff.  I have to talk to him.  I mean, he, he's, he's sewing up like, you know, things that should be stitched up and 
[01:26:30]  all that crap.  Like he's popping things that you shouldn't be popping and really.  Oh yeah.  Like he's like Rambo.  Oh yeah.  Rambo.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Sewing himself up.  Sewing himself up.  Oh yeah.  He just did.  Yeah.  Kidding me.  Well, I mean, we, we grew up pretty poor and then our health insurance was shaky at  best.  I mean, I think we went and saw a doctor once every five years.  And, uh, so we just got used to taking care of ourselves and taking care of our own injuries,  but he continues this to this day.  You guys aren't homeschooled. 
[01:27:00]  You're a home doctor.  Right.  Get in there and sew it up.  And, uh, finally, uh, the last item today, it's, it's a, uh, Robert Clark died.  You might say who, but director, director of Porky's and a Christmas story, uh, horrific  car accident on, uh, the Pacific, uh, Pacific coast highway, uh, out there in, uh, the  Palisades, Pacific Palisades.  I've been on that road.  It's a ridiculous road.  It's the, it's probably the most dangerous road in America.  California has some of the, the most dangerous roads you will ever see head on collision. 
[01:27:30]  Him and his son died.  Just horrific 22 year old, uh, guy that was completely hammered.  Some drunk Mexican just apparently went into the wrong lane and that's it for the guy that  gave us porkies and a Christmas story.  Uh, terrible.  There you go.  The world isn't really blown up, but that's pretty much what people are going to be talking  about today.  Uh, Jennifer in Wisconsin.  So let's get back to what's really important.  Jennifer, what do you got for the Opie and Anthony show?  No.  Guys, uh, love you.  Love your show.  Thank you.  Uh, love your name. 
[01:28:00]  By the way, Kevin and West Palm, Opie, to be a silent partner, you have to be silent  about it.  I was thinking the same thing.  I'm like, you're really the most outspoken silent partner ever.  And then fast Friday, he writes loudest and most heard silent partner ever.  Look, I'm proud of my brother and what he's doing with the joint.  And I think, uh, my name associated with the place maybe gets a few extra bodies in  the door.  Let's, let's be honest here.  It's a, it's a great hangout for the fans.  It's really becoming the place to go and just hang out with other fans.  Anyway, go ahead, Jennifer. 
[01:28:30]  Yeah.  Well, uh, you're talking about old people and how disgusting they are.  Uh, for the past couple of years, I've been having to clip my grandmother's toenails.  I don't know if you've ever seen an old person's feet, but the nails end up at some point looking  like broken off shards of hardened cheese.  Oh, no, I know what she's talking about.  The edge of the cheese that you cut off before you even begin eating it.  Oh, is that disgusting? 
[01:29:00]  You gotta go into a cheese shop, get the block of cheese and you just get rid of the end.  Yellow with like ridges in it.  It's really hard.  Dude, that's hilarious.  Disgusting.  And the smell is even worse.  It really smells like rotted cheese, too.  Holy Jesus.  Why don't you say something like wash your feet?  She's like 92, so, you know, you gotta die.  92.  So I can't just say, no, grandma, go screw yourself.  You know what's sad about being 92?  That's her pleasure. 
[01:29:30]  She probably used to do some horrific things in the, in the bedroom back in the day.  And now her pleasure has come down to her, her little granddaughter coming over.  Every once in a while, every once in a while and making believe she really wants to be there.  And she clips her toenails and she gets some kind of, like, tells everybody.  Some kind of little pleasure out of it.  That's her pleasure now.  That would be like us doing something amazing, like, like going out skydiving or something.  And you get home and you tell everybody, yeah, I went skydiving today.  She goes and tells her friends, my granddaughter came over and clipped my toenails. 
[01:30:00]  It was wonderful.  But that's something she now looks forward to.  And do your hands smell like her feet all day?  Oh, you don't know how many times I just wanted to bring over some of those gloves.  You know, like they were at Subway before they prepare your tail.  Yeah, before they put the cheese on.  The dog is, like, chowing on one of her nails in the corner.  Oh, oh.  Like a rawhide bone.  Yeah, a little silky terrier in the corner.  Shot on Grandpa's toenail. 
[01:30:30]  Yeah, it's even worse, too, than that.  Because the older you get, the thicker the nails get.  Yeah.  So I swear to God, some of her toenails are about a third of an inch thick.  I have to do a fucking hacksaw.  Oh, Jesus.  Watch your mouth.  Hacksaw.  She's very disturbed to the point she's cursing a lot.  Yeah, my grandmother has mummy feet.  Mummy feet.  All right, Jennifer, thank you.  Yeah, I love you guys.  Bye.  All right.  Toe jam from the 20s in there. 
[01:31:00]  Let's go to Peter in Cape Cod.  Wow.  What's up in Cape Cod?  Cape Cod.  Who lives there when it's not warm?  People that want to hide from the authorities.  That's who.  What's up, Peter?  It's terrible.  I'm sorry.  You know, that poor old lady you were talking to, does she know that that person didn't die or what?  Apparently she knows now.  Oh, Bill's dead?  You were only joking.  I was only joking.  We love that call, by the way.  Who is this? 
[01:31:30]  Oh, no.  You're kidding.  People get frustrated when we play some of the old stuff, but every time we play something from the old days,  you get a whole bunch of people hearing it from the old times.  How did it happen?  Oh, God love them.  Love her catchphrases.  Every line is a catchphrase with her.  Mark, another Cape Cod.  A two, two, twofer.  Mark, what's up?  Yeah, it's definitely a twofer.  I got a good story about some old people. 
[01:32:00]  I was taking care of my grandfather for a few years before he passed away, and one of my duties was to make him dinner.  And one day I was a little late because it was St. Paddy's Day, and I'd been at the bar.  And I got over there, and he was most of the way through about a gallon of ice cream.  Like children.  They turn into children.  Hold on.  That's all old people do.  Let's be honest.  They love to eat, and they love to talk about where they get the cheapest gas.  Yeah.  That's it. 
[01:32:30]  And it's usually a gas station where by the time you get there, it doesn't even matter.  You use so much gas to get the cheap gas.  What are you saving?  I never understood.  Do the math.  Figure out how many tenths of a cent you're saving at this other gas station and the size of your tank,  and it winds up you're saving maybe like eight cents.  My dad was getting to that point.  He would just talk about where he's getting his cheap gas.  You know what they're selling it for down the street?  What?  What?  You could save three cents a gallon.  Wow.  And once again, I would just say do the math, please. 
[01:33:00]  Anyway.  He's filling up a tanker truck.  Yeah.  Let's go, Mark.  All right.  Anyways, he was staying in an apartment at my folks' place.  So I went next door to make up his dinner and everything.  When I came back, he was in the bathroom.  And let's just say he didn't make it all the way to the bathroom.  All right.  Oh, boy.  He didn't manage to get his pants off.  So I just wanted to say you haven't lived until you've cleaned the mud out of your grandfather's bullpen with a hot face cloth. 
[01:33:30]  Is that going to make it?  I have no idea.  Wow.  Cleaning it out of the bullpen.  That's kind of funny.  I have no idea what made it, but Mark, thank you.  Wow.  You should never have to clean up after your grandfather like you do after a child.  Yeah, exactly.  There's no reason you would have to do that.  All right.  And you remember, like, when he was, like, kind of still a man.  You know, I remember, like, when my grandfather, because both my grandfathers are dead, but the last one that died years and years and years ago. 
[01:34:00]  I remember, like, when he was a man, you know, hey, give me a beer.  You know, I'm watching the Mets.  Yelling at grandma.  Crap like that.  And then they just turn into you, like, oh, God, look, he's old and feeble.  I never knew my grandfathers.  No?  One was a raging alcoholic.  And the other, I think he had a heart attack before I knew him.  Oh, Opie.  Yeah.  That's pretty much what happened with mine.  And I only had one grandmother that I loved.  The other one.  Ugh. 
[01:34:30]  Precious.  What did you call her?  What did you call her grandmother you loved?  Huh?  What did you call her?  Grammy.  Nana.  Grandma.  Nana.  Nana.  Nanny.  Poopy boopy.  I think it was just grandma.  Nana.  I just went with grandma.  Wah-wah.  I wasn't creative with my grandma pet name.  The C word.  Yeah, we got to do that.  But let's say hi to Ziggy real fast in D.C.  They're going to take a break here, Ziggy.  So what do you got?  I was going to do, uh, imagine your grandmother naked while you suck on her toes.  No. 
[01:35:00]  Suck on the cheese toes.  Or cheesy toes.  Yeah.  Yeah, cheesy toes.  On the cheese toes.  New cheesy toes by Doritos.  Yeah, Bob, we started a new bit since you've been here.  What's that?  Picture your grandma naked.  It just puts horrific thoughts into our listeners.  Yeah, and then you got to finish it up with some doing something horrible.  So what do you think of one and then you do it after the break?  It makes me think of, uh, pork jerky.  Just white meat jerky.  Oh, my God.  This is what's happening today. 
[01:35:30]  We got Bob Kelly in studio.  We got Bob Saget calling right after the break.  I was at his HBO taping.  He killed.  Of course.  And, uh, oh, yeah.  More Fonzie audio from 1984.  We're talking about child molestation.  This is gold.  Or molestation.  It's Henry Winkler and the Fonz together.  Oh, God.  That's one.  Dude, it's fantastic.  Hey, do we have the audio from yesterday?  I'll play that little thing going into break.  It's fantastic.  Where, uh, Bob Kelly.  Is it somewhere? 
[01:36:00]  Which one?  Oh, boy.  Which clip?  There's this song.  You are never to blame.  Yeah.  You are never to blame.  I like the other one.  That's, you know.  Except when you wear that dress.  Yeah, and they show.  And those tighty-whities.  I watched the video last night.  Yeah.  And during the You Are Never to Blame.  You are never to blame.  During the You Are Never to Blame song, they just show these dejected kids looking up at  the camera like, I did something bad, didn't I? 
[01:36:30]  And it's like, no, you are never to blame.  And they're looking at God.  Then why does it hurt so much if I'm not to blame?  Uh-huh.  Makes you want to cry.  Well, here's.  Yeah.  Don't burst out into tears.  This is from 1984.  Here's a song about your private parts.  This was on TV and was played for kids.  Yeah.  Come on, kids.  Save kids.  Oh, boy.  It wouldn't be that truck now.  Me, me, me, me.  Here it is as we go to break on the Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:37:00]  Penis is what boys have down in front.  Penis is the word, though it seems blunt.  All boys have a penis.  So no matter what you've heard, remember that penis is the proper word.  Vulva is what girls have down below.  Even though most people call it vagina and some children call it Virginia.  Vulva.  When she's naked, it will show.  All girls have a vulva.  So no matter what you've heard, remember that vulva is the proper word. 
[01:37:30]  Our anus is a useful thing indeed.  The anus gives relief in time of need.  We all have an anus.  So no matter what you've heard, remember that anus is the proper word.  So don't be appalled, because that's what they're called.  And each of them's the proper word for private parts.

[01:38:30]  On the phone, Bob Saget.  Good friend of the show.  What's up, Bob?  Not much.  I woke up.  Everything was good.  My girlfriend had a couple of wisdom teeth pulled.  She's functioning well.  Uh-oh.  Give her drugs?  No, not really.  I just took them right out.  Oh, you did?  Okay.  Times are rough.  It's actually a business, you know?  People can make a lot of money if they just pull out their girlfriend's teeth.  You're running out of that full house money?  Yeah, I'm in the whole outfit.  And then I hide them under the pillow, and I wait for the Wisdom Ferry to come. 
[01:39:00]  Wisdom Ferry.  Hey, Bob, we're all going to check you out at the North Fork Theater out there in Westbury,  Long Island on April 20th.  You guys, I don't know how you do it.  You're closer to me than my family.  I'm going to be stalking you, because I just saw your HBO taping, what, Friday?  Yeah, I'm really glad you were there.  Yeah, that meant a lot to me when you came backstage.  That was very nice.  I got to tell you, you killed.  It's a shame for that lady.  And I was telling the HBO people, and they argued the point slightly, but I'm like, 
[01:39:30]  America is going to just be amazed by the real Bob Saget.  And they're like, well, they're starting to understand that with the aristocrats and this and that.  I'm like, not really.  I think there's still a lot of people out there that think you're this nice, family-friendly entertainer.  Well, I am.  I just use that to get inside their house.  Right.  But you've always been known as a very dirty comic, the dirtiest comic at the club for  the most part.  Do you think it's too dirty, Opie? 
[01:40:00]  I mean, it's dirty, right?  No, I think it's dirty, but it's also clever, and I think they're going to be pleasantly  surprising.  This is the same Bob Saget from that show where he looked like a gay guy?  And then I'll be arrested, and I'll try to get my chromosomes for the next boys from Brazil.  This is the guy from the video show, the funniest videos.  Oh, and he goes just down and dirty.  It's funny.  I had some friends come to the second show, and I told them not to bring a kid.  They bring my friend's daughter. 
[01:40:30]  She's like 16.  I'm like, uh...  Oh, boy.  Those are my daughters.  My daughters weren't there because they were sparing me the self-edit.  Yeah.  They didn't really say it in front of my kids, that crap.  See, even the people close to you don't realize how dirty you are.  That's what I'm trying to say.  They're bringing their kids.  Yeah, 16.  By that age, they know, though.  I'm writing them out.  But I went out while they were after the show.  Yeah, I see.  There you go.  Of course you did.  It is amazing that I'm here.  I'm like 50 years old, and I got these girls. 
[01:41:00]  They're like, you know, it's like 19-year-old girls.  Where are their fathers that they would like flash their boobs at me and stuff, you know?  Nice.  Hey, Bob, can you talk about the weird dude at the hotel that you were telling me about?  I guess I can.  I doubt if he lives anywhere now, right?  I don't think he.  First of all, I don't think he listens to our show.  Second of all, you're long gone from the hotel.  But Bob Sag was a little creeped out while he was taping the HBO special.  Got a little creeped out.  Got a phone call on the voicemail, and I hear this thing.  He goes, hello. 
[01:41:30]  I've been watching you.  I'm three doors down.  I'll be here all week.  I'm from London.  I hope this isn't inappropriate.  I'm like, no, this is awesome.  Yeah, this is exactly what I want.  This is what I want, please.  Put your business card under my ass.  What did creepy English guy want?  He says he wanted to meet me for a cocktail.  Ah.  And I just said, you know, he's got too many vowels and confidence in that word.  Yeah.  Wow, he thought.  He says, I saw a very slender man go into his room. 
[01:42:00]  So I thought that was funny because I figured I'd be having drinks with him and go up slender, huh?  Yeah.  Hey, thanks.  Thanks for coming.  And he called again, and he called one of my daughter's rooms, and that was the end  of that.  So it was not good.  He noticed that his daughter was getting into an elevator.  He's calling from inside the room.  Right.  He's in the closet.  And it wasn't anything, really.  He was just a pervy, lonely, freaky dude because he was three doors down. 
[01:42:30]  And we've been in touch, and he's going to be at my show at Red Bank.  Oh, I was just about to ask you, why the hell are you calling today?  It's the Count Basie Theater in Red Bank, New Jersey, April 19th.  Tickets are on sale now.  That's like the Count Basie Theater.  That's like a major thing, I guess.  Is it?  Sinatra played in the room.  Yeah, but you know what's weird about that?  Every theater says it's an amazing theater.  So I don't know how to keep track anymore.  You know who played here?  Right. 
[01:43:00]  Well, they say Sinatra, but they don't tell you if it's Tina or Frank Jr.  Frank Jr.  Ooh.  Right.  It's just Jilly.  Jilly comes in.  You know, when you play over there in Westbury, that's in the round.  So you've got to make sure that the back of your suit looks good also.  Because for half the time, the crowd is looking at your ass.  I have a vent in it just in case they want to get in.  A little like the old-time long johns with the buttons in the back?  Yeah, and I've got a hemi hanging out. 
[01:43:30]  Because, you know, what the hell?  Let them have a treat.  You should just do your act to the people in front of you  and then show the old bowl of fruit to the people behind you.  The old fruit bowl.  The front people get the guy from TV.  The back people get a cornucopia.  Yeah.  It looks like a rooster's head.  That would be great.  They just spin you around and everyone gets a little of both.  And then I have it make sounds.  Like somehow I get a gobbledoo.  Yeah, put a little sound chip there. 
[01:44:00]  It seems like a Thanksgiving act.  The old gobbling fruit bowl.  Oh, my God.  So that's – I'm actually – it's like in a week, I guess.  It was two weeks.  I'm there for three nights.  At what?  I go to – I go to –  Oh, yeah.  You've got three dates in our area.  You've got April 19th, Count Basie Theater, Red Bank.  You said that.  April 20th, Westbury at the North Fork Theater.  I'm going to that show, Bob.  We'll see you again.  Good.  And then you're doing it in Boston at the Orpheum Theater on the 21st of April. 
[01:44:30]  Right.  And the Orpheum's like that.  That's what I like.  That's my chandelier circuit.  That makes me happy.  And what makes us happy, you're going to be on the O&A Traveling Virus Comedy Tour again.  I'm coming out with you guys.  Yeah.  There's no chandeliers in those places.  It's a rock concert, by the way.  I keep saying we've got to either broadcast what's going on backstage or film it for something  because, I mean, they set up like a strip club.  What show are we at?  Because you lose track when you tour.  Two girls were backstage right when I got off stage, or I was about to go out. 
[01:45:00]  I had my hammy hanging out.  And they said to me, we want to do you.  And I said, no, I've got to work, and I've got a girlfriend.  And they said, well, you've got a daughter?  And I said, yeah.  And they said, how old?  And I said, you know, like 20.  And they said, oh, we're that old.  That's good.  I'm like, this is great.  They can do math.  Yeah.  That's what you want to think of.  Hey, you're as old as my daughter. 
[01:45:30]  Well, this is what we do in every city.  We get the hot strip club to give us the girls.  Yep.  And they do their thing on stage.  And then they're really doing their thing backstage.  And then to the point we have to set up like a strip club.  We couldn't get Tracy Morgan.  We almost had to blow him off at one of the dates because he was getting freaking lap dances  right up to the point he was going on stage.  Yeah.  Well, Bobby, I'm just dancing with him.  There's nothing.  Just having a little fun.  I'm going to do a film to go out and then I'm going to walk the audience.  I don't walk them. 
[01:46:00]  They're not going to walk, but I'm going to talk about it.  Yeah.  But the crap that was going on backstage was maybe even better than some of the stuff on  stage.  It is.  One of the things that I loved about it was the, and I didn't even know a lot of the  crap that was going on out on the floor.  You know, a lot of stuff that got on the YouTube and stuff that was on your website and all the  crazy drama that it turns into ancient Rome out there.  Yeah.  But I'm just, you know, I don't have time for that.  I just want to talk real dirty and real fast and make them laugh and then look at the strippers. 
[01:46:30]  Yeah.  That's pretty much the game plan.  That's the other thing.  Like if you're in the middle of a show, a lot of times you would just leave.  You can't leave.  You're backstage.  No, you got to stay back there.  Action.  Action going on.  All these guys that hang out back there, they're all like nine feet tall and they're called tiny.  Yeah.  I know.  Well, that whole gag.  I know.  But we're starting it up again in Vegas, April 14th, Bob.  You're not going to make that one, unfortunately, but we got a few dates that Bob Saget will be on. 
[01:47:00]  Yeah.  And a good number of dates because I was looking at them and they kind of fit into my schedules,  like end of the summer and then the HBO thing is end of the summer.  And then I figured I can never be seen on the streets again.  Hey, Bob, you know our relationship is getting to that weird, awkward point.  I felt like after the taping for HBO, I'm thinking, I think this is the night that we hang out a little bit.  A little double day, a little dinner, maybe a few drinks.  I was thinking it.  If you had come to the second taping, I'd have begged you to go out. 
[01:47:30]  I'm starting to think that that's where this thing is heading.  Wow.  Oh, yeah.  No, let me just first tell you this.  I got to – this is how I turn off a guy if I'm not sure if they're hitting on me or not.  You know, I have to take a six, but my Hemi is really big now.  You know, some guys don't like that.  Hey, we got to take a call from Pittsburgh, big Bob Saget fan.  Tim in Pittsburgh, you're on with Bob Saget.  What's up, Bob?  I can't believe I'm talking to Bob Saget right now. 
[01:48:00]  Oh, thank you, man.  What's up?  Hey, I grew up watching on Full House on American Funny in some videos.  I'm not going to lie.  I thought you were the biggest faggot in the world.  Absolutely.  Yeah, until I started watching Entourage, and you told Vince, don't you fuck my daughter.  I'm not kidding.  Don't you fuck my daughter.  Yeah, that's a bleep right there.  If your phone wasn't so distorted, they'd have to censor you.  Oh, I'm sorry, man.  Yeah, well –  People are very excited to talk to Bob.  Well, that was more like quotes in Entourage.  I just didn't know he got that phone when he bought his Sports Illustrated subscription. 
[01:48:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, I got my phone.  I'm in the middle right now.  I got to get ready to go.  I'm signing out.  Sorry, guys.  All right, man.  Take it easy.  I want to make sure people understood what happened there because they dumped out.  Tim hated you, Bob.  Hated your guts.  Thought you were a, you know, limp-wristed you-know-what until he saw you on Entourage,  and now he thinks you're the coolest thing in the world.  So that's what I'm saying.  America's going to be surprised, and you're going to get a whole new fan base, my friend.  Well, it's nice to hear from a guy that you can't understand. 
[01:49:00]  Right, right.  But he actually sounded like a nice guy.  Yeah, the hardest part for me is when they go, you know, I used to hate you, now I like you.  It's kind of like, wow, that's just a great thing.  But, Bob, you've been honest on our show.  You hated yourself during that period, didn't you?  Well, it was part of my, you know, there was part of me that liked it, which was I had a one-year-old baby and an acute ex-wife now.  But, I mean, you know, I had a little postcard life, you know, and so, yeah, I hated it.  But anyway, it was, I didn't really hate it. 
[01:49:30]  I didn't really hate it.  I mean, it was full house.  I was doing it.  They were paying me, and I was working, playing with those guys, so we were all making fun of it as we were doing it.  I just want to picture you, like, with all just these checks stacked up in front of you on the dresser,  but you look in the mirror and start crying and punch in the mirror, F you, just, like, yelling at the Bob Saget in the mirror  with all just these piles of money around you, and you're just like, damn you.  Yeah, yeah, rotten hell, Danny Tanner.  Yeah, right. 
[01:50:00]  They had a shot of me.  Somebody told me about this, and it airs still.  I'm sitting in a bathtub with the kids that John Stamos' character had, Nicky and Alex,  and I'm topless holding these kids in front of my tiots, and it's just the gayest thing I've ever done.  Oh, God, what an awful shot.  And it's in the bathtub, and people, like, have a picture.  They take a screenshot off of TV.  It's porno.  It's absolutely porno.  I've got little boys in front of my nipples. 
[01:50:30]  Yeah.  It ain't right.  I like watching Full House now because it's on all the time.  It's the new Brady Bunch.  Whenever you turn on your TV, Full House is on, like the old Brady Bunch was, right?  And just knowing you a little bit and knowing that you're just beyond dirty,  now I start thinking what he's actually thinking as he's filming the scene,  and it makes me really, really happy.  It's a whole new, like, viewing experience.  It really is.  When you sit on the edge of the bed and give some advice to one of your daughters, 
[01:51:00]  the music kicks in, and you're giving some crappy advice to your kids.  Honey, honey, it's really not right for a boy to treat you that way.  It's okay for me to treat you that way.  Yeah, exactly.  Get in the bathtub and let Daddy take his shirt off.  Your gay gladiator parenting scene.  By the way, I've got to acknowledge a bunch of people saying they loved you in Half Baked.  You were only in it for a little bit.  Yeah.  And you talk about that during your HBO special, and that made me laugh really hard, Bob. 
[01:51:30]  Thank you.  I don't want to give away that joke, because, you know,  you want people to be a little surprised when they watch comedy, right?  Yeah.  It's a fun thing, because people think it.  You know, the college-age people all saw the movie, so they're like,  and people do yell that crap at me, which is a little scary.  They pretty much yell Bob Saget's line at him, and Bob has a whole thing he does in that.  It's funny.  It's like every cameo I did has amounted to one giant quilt of filth.  Yeah. 
[01:52:00]  You're quotable, though.  You might have one or two scenes in Entourage or Half Baked, but it's quotable.  Right.  Well, the key now for me is to do, you know, an acting part or like a real, you know,  a lengthy one that's going to be somewhere I just get to, like, sink my,  really sink my testicles into.  Let's say hi to Carl in Jersey.  Carl, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, man?  Bob, I was there Friday at NYU.  You absolutely killed.  I took a bunch of my buddies. 
[01:52:30]  Were you surprised, or did you know that Bob gets this dirty there, Carl?  I had heard that he gets dirty, but I have never seen him,  and wow, he just surpassed all of my expectations.  Yeah.  Thank you, man.  They arrested me after that, too.  It gets to a point, Bob, you make everyone uncomfortable in the audience.  I know.  That's the weirdest part of it when, like, normal nice dudes will call up and go, you know.  I had to call my mother.  You know, the fact that you address it is what really twists this, you know what I mean,  that you address the full house and you address the, you know, the afterthoughts of, wow, 
[01:53:00]  what you were into and stuff.  It was pretty neat.  Excellent job, guys.  Excellent job.  Cool, Carl.  Thanks.  I really appreciate that.  That's like, you know, it was to be shooting a TV show and to hear that response.  Again, do these guys not have good phones?  Oh, you can't really hear them today?  Oh, no.  Is it distorted from your side?  No, it's clear.  We won't throw you on with anybody else.  That's what I said.  Yeah, there must be something in the thing from my ear, from the board.  You guys sound good. 
[01:53:30]  He was a nice guy.  I could hear that.  When's the special going to be on HBO?  End of August.  End of August.  Okay, we got a while there.  We got plenty of time for you and me to go out because I can tell you something's going to happen.  Yeah, I think we're going to be friends.  Ready to step it up a notch.  And then what happens?  The next level.  Fast forward a year or two and then you'll trash me just like Dice is doing.  Whatever.  It's just how Hollywood works.  I understand now.  I would never do that.  In fact, what size sweater do you wear?  I got a box from Neiman Marcus for you. 
[01:54:00]  I hope you can hear this because Kathy Middletown has something for you.  I'll translate if that helps.  Kathy, go ahead.  You're on with Bob Saget.  Oh, hi, Bob.  Bob, I just wanted to tell you I'm forced to watch at least two episodes a night of Full House.  And I agree with Anthony.  I just enjoy it so much more now thinking of all the dirty things you're thinking about during every scene.  There you go.  And I look forward to it.  And also, I saw you.  You were hysterical.  I actually, I died.  I wanted to take my shirt off to show you.  I was like in the third row.  But I couldn't get, I was at the PNC Art Center last summer. 
[01:54:30]  Right.  I couldn't quite get your attention, but you are a riot.  And I'm telling you, 9 o'clock, Nickelodeon, I beg my kids to stay up and watch it now.  Thank you.  See, I never in my career would ever think that after doing Full House, while I was doing it, you would say that one day.  All right, Kathy.  Thank you.  Very funny.  All right.  We got to take a break here.  So, Bob, we're promoting April 19th, Count Basie Theater, Red Bank. 
[01:55:00]  Yes, sir.  The 20th at the North Fork Theater in Westbury.  We're going to be at that show, a bunch of us.  And then 21st for everyone in Boston, the Orpheum Theater.  That's perfect.  And we can go out the 20th.  Yeah, let's do a little something, something.  We'll do something, maybe.  Have you ever killed a man?  That'd be fun.  Imagine you go out with Saget and, like, he murders somebody.  You know, Bob's really dirty.  He's not that family guy.  You know what else?  He kills people.  He just kills me.  You guys are driving around, and he just, like, kills a homeless guy.  Who's the kind of British dude in the trunk? 
[01:55:30]  Oh, Bob, one time too many.  He read it perfectly.  He goes, I think he's on to what I'm into.  Yeah.  All right.  We're going to do this.  This is what you want to do.  I'm going to kill hookers tonight.  And just, like, yeah, grab a hooker and just cut her up.  Right.  There's you and Bob Saget in a hotel room hacksawing a hooker's legs off, just laughing.  Wow, Bob, I really never thought there was this side of you.  Awesome.  Full of surprises.  I thought I was the only one.  The girl was taking a bubble bath.  I'm going to have a boot swing. 
[01:56:00]  I'll be like, turn up the music.  Right.  Right.  Oh, God.  Well, thank you guys, as always.  And I'm looking forward to seeing you in just a couple weeks.  Absolutely.  Going to be a blast, man.  Yeah.  Thank you again.  And, Opie, thanks for coming to the show.  That was really great to see you after.  I was really happy.  Yeah, let's be honest.  For the radio, I have to, like, BS a lot.  But I'm telling the truth.  You were just amazing.  Oh, my God.  You really were great.  I'm going to start macromay right now.  The reputation's on the line.  They'll see for themselves when it comes out on HBO in late August there. 
[01:56:30]  Oh, God.  Literally, some people are going to go, what has he done?  Why did he do this?  And, you know, we're a little hurt because you were in town, but you didn't do our show.  But I guess we've got to understand you had to get ready for the big HBO taping.  Well, I was taking my daughter on a college tour.  Oh, okay.  So I was taking – well, I said it was my daughter.  Yeah.  Well, next time you've got to, you know, stop in and we do the whole show together.  I'm doing it.  All right, Bob.  Thank you so much.  Thank you, guys.  All right.  Bob Saget.  Talk to you later.  Thanks.  Everyone.  Because Bob Saget, you know, throughout that entire chat we were having with Bob – I don't 
[01:57:00]  like calling it an interview.  It's just him calling it.  Pal Talk wasn't commenting on it at all.  Why?  Because look at where the camera's pointing.  It's pointing right there.  Where?  See?  Yeah.  And Pal Talk is commenting on Bob Kelly eating through the whole thing.  Some people are saying, hey, Bob, look out.  There's some blood in your cholesterol stream.  They're just constantly commenting because – 
[01:57:30]  It's egg whites.  You're shoving food in your mouth nonstop on camera.  It's egg whites and it's been for five minutes, you morons.  I said, I haven't – I had to turn off the camera.  Bob's taking up too much bandwidth.  That's funny.  I didn't want to bring this to everyone's attention because it just flat out creeped me out.  Someone on Instant Feedback gave me a little heads up.  And it also has to do with Pal Talk and Bob Kelly.  What? 
[01:58:00]  I guess there's a thing going on all morning where they're saying,  anyone else noticing that Bob Kelly is staring at Opie's body when Opie's not looking at him?  This is the feedback I read.  So I've been really uncomfortable for the last hour and a half.  Are you staring?  But, like, it's been a thing all morning.  They're like, anyone else noticing that when Opie looks, like, toward the window or toward Anthony,  he starts staring at his body.  Well, do me this, then.  Stop working out.  We don't want that to happen.  Stop working out. 
[01:58:30]  Stop eating egg whites.  When he was staring, though, and taking a sausage link and pushing it in and out of his mouth,  that got a little unnerving.  Jesus.  Have you noticed I started flouching for the last hour?  I'm doing everything I can to just look not approachable to you.  You don't see me staring at Club Soda Anthony, a little thin guy.  I'm staring at you with your pecs.  What's wrong with Club Soda?  You're working out.  What's wrong with Club Soda Anthony?  He's not my type.  I am working out.  He's not my type.  And Anthony is working out.  He's not my...  I don't like...  I got to get big like Steve. 
[01:59:00]  That's my hero.  Steve.  Steve's my inspiration.  All right.  We got a break.  You're the wind beneath my wings.  Hey.  And I don't stare at you.  I'm staring at your body.  I'm staring at you.  Ew.  That makes it a lot better, doesn't it?  I see.  Desi takes another bite of food.  I just want to keep...  It's wrong on so many levels.  It just bugs me that the microphone, this thing keeps getting in my way.  All right.  Like that.  But I read that.  I answered feedback.  And then I'm like trying...  This has been going on all morning.  I'm glad we're finally talking about it.  Because now I'm trying to like catch him looking at me without anyone else in the room noticing. 
[01:59:30]  I'm like, is this really happening?  All right.  Go ahead.  Or is...  Go ahead.  No.  Because now like it's a bit.  But for real, I'm sitting there like...  God, maybe they're just effing with me on instant feedback.  So like I'm talking to Anthony and listening to what he's saying.  And I'm like trying to look at the corner of my eye to see if you're staring at me.  Instant feedback?  Oh, okay.  No, because they do mess with us from a time.  You never know when they're real.  Really?  Instant feedback messes with you?  Just a little bit.  A little bit.  Bob, egg whites are healthy, but not by the gross. 
[02:00:00]  Bob, what are you eating?  Ostrich egg whites?  When is Pal Talk going to be available in widescreen?  So we can see all of Bob?  You know, it's not fair.  He lost weight.  No, listen.  You got to give it up for those all very funny.  You got to give it up.  If any of them weren't funny, I'd attack you, you losers at home on a webcam.  But every single one of them was pretty brilliant.  And you have lost weight, Bob.  Thumbs up, you freaking jackasses.  You lost some weight, Bob.  I mean, egg whites.  You lost some weight.  Hey, Steven asks from Bayshore, hey, yo, Bob's picturing you covered in nothing but gravy. 
[02:00:30]  Are we going to get to the Molestation Fonzie Part 2 thing before we get out of here today?  All right, let's take a quick break and we'll do that next.  It's Opie and Anthony.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony virus.  What's up, man?  How are you guys doing? 
[02:01:00]  We're back.  That's right, the Opie and Anthony Show slash Bob Kelly sometimes.  Maybe when Billy, Patrice, Bob Saget, and Joe Rogan and anybody else is in a town show.  Standing in for Jimmy.  I know.  You beat out Rich Voss at least.  I hope so.  Might as well just fill it with my little brother.  Standing in for Jimmy Norton, who's down in what, Miami Beach? 
[02:01:30]  Miami Beach, Coconut Grove.  The Improv in Coconut Grove.  Coconut Grove.  Tickets available.  Tickets available at the improv.com.  And all you can go to is eatabullet.com.  Go see Jimmy Norton.  It's a great club, except this club, actually, the stage is in the middle and the room is  like a triangle.  Yeah.  So it's like splits in half.  You have a left side of the room and a right side of the room.  Yeah, I've been there.  Yeah, it's a good club, but the place they put you up is fantastic.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Is it one of those condos? 
[02:02:00]  But it's a brand new condo, so it's like the whole room is just white.  And you have the balcony that goes around the whole room.  Jimmy will ruin it.  Yeah.  Just bring a fluorescent light through the place and watch things light up.  It looks like a disco.  Why fluorescent?  You'll come in and just be brown and red colors.  So yeah, he's down there.  That's a good club, though.  All right, listen.  We're babbling.  We got to get some more Fonzie audio for these people. 
[02:02:30]  Oh, Fonzie audio.  Quick.  I try to keep people on track.  You do.  You're amazing.  I'm the unsung hero.  I'm going to look at your torso.  Stop.  What?  Get to the Fonzie.  Oh, I'm sorry.  1984.  I don't have much time.  Stop wearing Simon Cow shirts.  Simon Cow?  That's an insult.  Why?  It's a tight shirt.  You're wearing a nice tight shirt.  No, he wears those sweaters and it's the V.  Oh, you're wearing one of those.  I hate toes.  I hope he's evil hair.  Look at him. 
[02:03:00]  Anyway.  Fonzie.  And Henry Winkler.  Yes.  You got two.  Two for one as they talk about, you know, kid touching.  You look like the kid in The Incredibles.  I can be a superhero, too.  I made these.  I just pulled my hair straight out.  I don't give a crap.  All right.  Fonzie audio.  I'm just trying to ugly myself up so you stop looking at me.  Yeah, well, I told you.  And your fly's undone, too.  Will you stop?  Well, stop teasing me. 
[02:03:30]  I don't know.  Stop teasing me with the belt hanging out and then.  I'm not teasing it.  I know this flies open.  I hate buttoning up after every freaking.  Ow.  I'm getting shocked like crazy.  What's wrong?  Whoa.  Henry Winkler.  With static electricity all over my head right now.  Fonzie audio will make it better.  Oh, okay.  Henry Winkler and Fonzie getting together.  1984.  Yeah.  Molestation.  Yes, we started this yesterday.  Public service thing they did.  All right.  We start with a missing verse from that private parts song that we played going at the break.  There's a missing verse that we found. 
[02:04:00]  Wow.  It's about...  A missing verse.  I'm serious.  It's about boobies.  Really?  We can play all this over here, right?  Yeah.  Al said this was all good.  Apparently, the clips that we played yesterday, it was from somebody with...  What?  What?  What?  They had edited it down a lot, so I found the whole 42-minute version and pulled it.  42-minute video?  Yeah.  Where?  It's actually on Google Videos.  Oh, okay.  I'll have to watch it.  We want to play every single second of this video. 
[02:04:30]  God.  We should dedicate a whole week to this.  Nothing but goodness.  All right.  Here's the missing verse from the body parts song about the boobies.  Both boys and girls have breasts.  Each person recognizes they're found upon our chest.  Sizes?  And grow to different sizes.  Nice.  Our anus.  What?  Again?  Oh, oh.  I thought he was doing a reprieve of the... 
[02:05:00]  Yeah, then he goes, I guess.  He's obsessed with that body part.  Back to our anus.  He really loves the...  I want to talk about anus again.  He loves it.  Boobies.  Boobies.  All right.  Want to move right on?  Our anus.  What?  Stop.  Enough about the anus.  Our anus.  Stop.  Vulva.  All right.  Vulva.  Good.  Anus.  Good.  Vulva.  Anus.  Good.  Our anus. 
[02:05:30]  Stop.  Enough.  Anus.  Vulva.  Our anus.  You are never to blame.  That's the song, right?  All right.  That's the remix.  They're playing in clubs.  He's hoping no one notices that he just keeps going back to anus.  Yeah.  How funny would that be?  He just keeps going back to anus.  He just loves that.  I don't know.  Anus.  Yeah.  All right.  Here we go.  Saul's rule.  Our anus.  That's Saul's rule? 
[02:06:00]  What's wrong with Saul?  Saul's got a one-track mind.  Stop.  This is the touching song.  Oh, okay.  We get to the touching song.  Saul's rule.  Nobody is supposed to touch your private parts.  Till when?  And you're not supposed to touch anybody else's private parts.  The touching song.  There are three kinds of touches. 
[02:06:30]  This we know.  Our anus.  No.  No?  No.  Oh.  Anthony.  Oh, damn.  Is it the same creepy guy?  Yeah.  Like you said yesterday, he wanted to be the next James Taylor or Jim Croce, and this is what he gets.  This is his claim to fame.  The claim to fame is just singing about this crap.  He really does the same guitar riff.  It could be a classic.  His audience is four to 12-year-olds. 
[02:07:00]  Great.  That's what he was hoping for when he first picked up the guitar when he was 12.  Some people turn into Kurt Cobain, and others sing about, you know, yeah.  They're selling his classics right now.  Yeah.  Late at night.  Now.  The hits.  In 1999, you can get anus with a double CD of anus.  All these hits, you'll get anus and vulva and our anus, and who could forget, you are 
[02:07:30]  never to blame.  Call now.  Love this guy.  Can we get back to the touching song, please?  Yeah, please.  There are three kinds of touches.  This we know.  A heart, a question mark, and no.  No means stop.  A no touch. 
[02:08:00]  That's easy.  I don't like it.  Don't feel good.  Keep your hands to yourself.  Oh.  Heart means go.  A heart touch.  That's a touch I like.  That feels good.  Question mark means I don't know.  A question mark touch.  What kind of touch is that?  That's the one that starts off okay, and then you get this little voice inside that says,  uh-oh.  It starts to get yucky.  You tell somebody you trust right away about that kind of a touch.  That uh-oh touch.  All right?  Our anus. 
[02:08:30]  Wow.  You tell somebody.  Yeah, all right.  It's a yucky touch when you reach down there, and you feel like a penis.  I feel yucky.  Oh.  The yucky touch.  What is-  What?  So there's the bad one that you just know is bad.  That's why the guy isn't even trying to be subtle.  I'll have it.  Yeah.  Who's going to believe the little bride?  It's like a scene out of Caligula. 
[02:09:00]  Right.  It's like Patrice at a car wash.  I can't tell you that story.  The guy just grabbed it.  What's this?  Then there's the okay touch.  What was it called?  The heart touch.  No, no.  The good one.  The heart touch.  And that's like-  It's a hug from grandma.  Oh, okay.  You know, a little tussle.  And that's okay.  It's okay.  Cunningham.  And then the question mark, it starts okay.  Yeah.  And then the creep decides-  It starts okay.  All right, this is going well.  Let me see how far I can take this. 
[02:09:30]  So it's like you're-  Maybe it's the softball coach, the baseball coach or something like that.  And he says, good job.  And gives you a little swat on the behind, but his hand doesn't leave.  It doesn't leave right away.  And then you start feeling icky.  No, I mean ever.  He just walks around the field like that.  And then you get that question mark and that ooky feeling.  Yeah.  All right.  Okay.  You are never too late.  Just remember that.  By the way, we have ten tracks.  Our anus.  I don't think we're getting past the second track here, unfortunately.  Damn it. 
[02:10:00]  So you're going to have to listen tomorrow.  Oh.  And I'm going to watch the whole thing now tonight that I know where it is.  Yeah.  Look at Danny sniffing it out.  Nice.  Was it Danny?  Did you find it?  Certainly did.  I hate to give you credit if it's someone else.  Hey.  Hey.  If we focus, we get through the touching song.  Focus.  And then the next track, when it's okay for your parts to be touched.  Oh.  Okay.  Right away about that kind of a touch.  That uh-oh touch.  You're right.  Touch.  There are three kinds of touches that we know. 
[02:10:30]  A heart, a question mark, and no.  Kids.  No means stop.  Couldn't this hack make it a little easier than that?  Yeah.  The lyrics, you can tell the kids are like, ah.  Three kinds of touches we all know.  I don't know the thing.  I'll just say.  Those are easy.  Yeah.  And no, no means stop.  Heart means go.  Question mark means I don't know. 
[02:11:00]  No means stop.  Heart means go.  Question mark means I don't know.  Our anus.  No.  Oh.  Sorry.  That's the encore.  That's the encore.  That's the square garden.  Everyone.  You know what's so pathetic?  Like, this guy is really giving it his all.  He's hoping to get discovered.  Oh, yeah.  So he can sing real crap.  I don't know.  Maybe you've heard my song, uh, Anus. 
[02:11:30]  I heard that.  Yeah.  Did you hear that one?  And the other song, Penis.  It's great.  And then, uh, the, uh.  Pulvo?  Yeah.  And I have, I have a new one called Stinky Finger.  Oh, no.  No.  No.  No.  No.  So this is very tricky, Bob.  We're skating.  The ice is very thin here.  Yeah.  This is old school.  It takes a certain finesse.  You just fell into the icy pond.  Yeah.  This is old school, Opie and Anthony. 
[02:12:00]  I'm used to XM.  You're underwater in the frozen water.  We're looking at you through the ice.  Don't, I ain't risking my life.  No.  F that.  All right.  Can we concentrate or focus a little more and get another one?  All right.  Here we go.  Um, when it's okay for your parts to be touched, we got 10 tracks, maybe more tomorrow.  Yeah.  This is only the third one.  So you're going to have to make sure you tune in this, uh, show tomorrow and linger longer.  Oh.  King girl.  Nobody should touch your private parts except you. 
[02:12:30]  Now, we're not talking about taking a bath.  You know, when you're taking a bath, sometimes your mother, she's got to wash your private parts.  Everybody knows the difference between washing and when washing gets used as an excuse for touching you in private places.  Did you know that your doctor needs your parents' permission to examine you to touch your private parts?  Oh, yeah.  Dig it.  It's great what we're talking about.  We're not talking about touching and hugging and kissing when two people love each other.  We're talking about touching for sex. 
[02:13:00]  And when it's an adult touching a child in this way, it's wrong.  And we always know.  Nobody should touch your private parts except you.  But if somebody does, tell your mom or dad right away.  No.  Go.  Tell.  Ah.  I remember that.  So it's okay to wash...  I don't think that's okay.  I think after the age of seven or eight months, done.  Enough.  Can I ask you a question, though?  Is it okay for you to wash your mom?  No.  Is that okay? 
[02:13:30]  Can you wash each other?  No.  Are you sure?  How old?  What?  Thirteen.  No.  How old what?  Like, how old should your parents be washing your till?  Like, if your mom took you in the tub and then she was like, wash me, would that be bad?  Yeah.  Right now, you mean?  Well, not now.  Yeah.  That should be bad.  Now it'd be bad.  We wouldn't fit in the tub.  Maybe tomorrow I can talk about the time he showered with his dad.  What?  Just maybe.  No.  Because we ran out of show today.  You showered with your dad? 
[02:14:00]  I've told that story before, but I'm sure we have new listeners.  I'll make it quick.  Me looking at Opie's torso, you were showering your paws.  Yeah, you're looking at the wrong guy, buddy.  It was traumatic.  Soaping Opie up in the tub.  I was in kindergarten.  Traumatic.  Singing anus.  Will you let him say the story real fast?  You're going to cut out anything?  No, I'll wait until tomorrow, but it was traumatic.  I was a kid, and just to see that, it was just...  You didn't understand. 
[02:14:30]  I didn't understand.  I couldn't grasp it.  It was like looking into a funhouse mirror, you know, because I'm used to me.  And then I step in there and just was like...  What the F?  Yeah, it was awful.  You couldn't even wash it.  There was just so much hair.  No, I wasn't...  I wasn't washing.  Oh, wow.  What were you doing?  I was just in there.  You were just staring at it.  It was in there.  It was Dad teaching me and my brother how to take a shower.  Ugh.  Yeah, exactly.  He was in with you? 
[02:15:00]  Yeah, there was no touching.  It was just, you know, him, like, washing and showing us how to shower.  Are you puppies?  Why would he need to be in here with you?  Exactly.  It was the dumbest thing and it was traumatic.  Yeah, I don't know.  I don't understand that.  And then we took calls from other people.  This was like normal behavior in their house.  Back in the old days.  Weird.  And I don't think...  Parents, I'm not a parent, but I don't think you should be touching your kids' anything.  They weren't touching.  But I'm just saying...  Oh, anyway...  Yeah, I don't think...  I mean, just being in a bath that's all sudsy and stuff, we'll take care of it good enough. 
[02:15:30]  After it gets to the point where a kid doesn't have to be cleaned up after himself...  Right.  Then there's no reason a parent should be...  Then it's creepy.  Unless maybe they're a suspect of some medical problem.  You know, if all of a sudden a big spot turns up somewhere, then you might want to kind of pick it up and look underneath and make sure everything's on the up and up.  That's who we wake up tomorrow.  Oh, why?  Parents that are disappointed in the size of their kids, you know what. 
[02:16:00]  All right.  They're out there.  They're ready tomorrow morning.  They're out there.  And then you have little discussions before you fall asleep at night.  Oh, God.  You saw it, too.  Oh, my God.  It's like an acorn.  This is my mother's phone number.  You can just call her.  Bob, get the plug in.  We got to go.  Our music ended and everything.  Oh, we're in trouble.  Go, go, go, go.  May 17th to the 20th, Comics Club in New York City.  212-524-2500 for tickets.  We had so much fun, we went late.  I'm sorry for whoever's following us in all the other cities. 
[02:16:30]  I know JV and Elvis are following us here in New York.  I'm sorry, guys.  All right.  We'll see you over at XM.  If not, have a great day.  Bye-bye.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  We'll see you over at XM.  Thank you. 
[02:17:00]  Thank you. 
[02:17:30]  Thank you. 
[02:18:00]  Thank you. 
[02:18:30]  Thank you. 
[02:19:00]  Thank you. 
[02:19:30]  Well, why doesn't he come in and hang with us, Colin Quinn? 
[02:20:00]  Bob Kelly just got a text or phone call from Mr. Colin Quinn.  He should come in and just hang.  He should.  He should live a block away.  He could walk over.  He doesn't have to worry about having a heart attack.  He could have came in this morning.  It would have been nice.  It would have been nice.  Hey, we got a big star outside the studio.  I mean, come on.  Freddy Rodriguez.  Freddy Rodriguez. 
[02:20:30]  Freddy Rodriguez.  Did you see...  Oh, you haven't seen it yet?  You're not privileged to see the movie before it comes out in theaters.  I've already seen it.  I got tickets.  Grindhouse.  Yeah, I got tickets.  Actually, please slam me.  Are you serious?  You're good friends with Quinn, actually.  No, I'm joking.  I haven't seen it.  But we're all about Grindhouse.  We've had...  God, we've had Kurt Russell in so far, who's stuntman Mike.  We had Robert Rodriguez, the director of Planet Terror, starring that man right there, Freddy Rodriguez. 
[02:21:00]  And we also had Quentin Tarantino in a couple days ago.  And everybody says...  Every review I got is the first one.  Robert's is actually...  Not that it's...  It's just better.  Not that either one's worse, one stinks and one doesn't.  And they're both good, but that one's...  The first one's better.  A lot of people told me that.  And then there's definitely a lot more action in the first one, the slasher zombie film,  which I thoroughly enjoyed.  And then the Quentin movie after that makes it seem a little weird.  But then when you take a day after you see both features, no, I like both of them equally. 
[02:21:30]  Yeah?  Yeah.  And Quentin's nowhere near the show today, so I'm not BSing.  Not kissing an ace.  Yeah.  Not kissing anus.  Yeah.  Freddie, come on in, man.  What is he doing out there?  No, but Grindhouse is amazing.  So far, the early reviews have been unbelievable.  All right, good, buddy.  How you doing?  What's happening?  How you doing?  How you doing?  Good.  Good to see you, man.  Anthony hasn't seen it yet.  He's good.  No, damn it.  I'm going...  Righty, yeah.  Very bad.  Bob Kelly hasn't seen it yet. 
[02:22:00]  No.  I just saw him in...  What's that movie you did with Batman?  What's the...  Oh, Harsh Times.  Harsh Times.  I just actually rented that three days ago.  What the hell is that?  It's a great movie.  Let's start there.  What's Harsh Times all about?  You know what?  You think it's going to be this one movie, like this cop...  It's really weird, man.  It's these two guys.  You think they're cops, but they're not.  They dress up in suits, and they drive around in a cop car, but they're just like these dudes  who smoke weed, and get into trouble, and get into fights, and then they go to Mexico. 
[02:22:30]  It's the guy who wrote Training Day.  So if you guys see Training Day, it's the same format, two guys in a car, and it's me and  Christian Bale, the guy who played Batman.  Yeah.  And we just played these best friends who, as he said, roll around and smoke weed and  drink, and two screw-ups.  You guys would love it.  I thought I'd seen every Christian Bale movie.  This one's a good movie.  It's a little different, though.  I missed that one.  Because you're waiting for him to pull out a badge, but he's a guy trying to be a cop,  but can't get on the force.  Then he gets on the feds, and he's got a chick. 
[02:23:00]  Eva Longoria plays her girlfriend.  She's gorgeous.  And he actually put her through school, so now she's a lawyer paying the bills, and he's  going to get a job, but he winds up hanging out with Christian Bale all day, and they  just smoke weed, get drunk, and he's fighting it.  Yeah.  We'll go try to cop some weed, and instead of paying for it, we'll rob the drug dealer  and take all his weed and take his gun, and we'll go try to sell the gun to get more  money to buy more weed.  I've got to see that one. 
[02:23:30]  Yeah.  Good movie.  Good movie.  All right.  Let's say hi to Dan in North Carolina.  Dan, what's up?  Yeah, I love you guys.  Love the show.  Listen, Freddie, I was wondering how great Anne Hathaway's boobs and havoc were.  You looked like you were having a good time.  Oh, man.  Yeah, it was crazy.  It's the first time I've ever been butt naked with a woman in a movie.  Anne Hathaway's a cool chick.  You know, whenever you do scenes like that, it's always strange, man, because you've got  like 30 people in the room, you've got the grip and the back yawning and eating donuts, 
[02:24:00]  you know, so it's got to be, you know.  But that would actually turn me on.  Right.  That would actually turn people to watch me.  Well, you don't want him to look like, what's his name there on Boogie Nights, holding the  mic, boom, going, just freaking out, shaking, looking at Dirk Diggler's cock just freaking  out.  That scene's great, man.  He's trying to hold the mic, boom, and he's just shaking, just losing his mind.  I've got to watch them. 
[02:24:30]  Speaking of being naked, Freddie's naked with Rose McGowan in Planet Terror, the first feature  in Grindhouse.  Did you get to see some stuff or what?  A little bit, a little bit, you know, a lot of cutting around there.  No, they cut for the movie, but I'm thinking that Rose McGowan isn't shy about her body.  It's like, I don't give a fuck if Freddie sees it or Robert Rodriguez, hint, hint, hint,  things about that.  But it looks like she's not shy and you get to see everything when you're filming that  scene.  A little bit.  A little bit.  A little bit. 
[02:25:00]  Not much.  Not much.  It's, you know, it's movie magic, what you see on screen.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  It wasn't as sexy as it looked.  Yeah, the only movie that was good like that was The Brown Bunny.  She actually blew the guy.  Yeah, what's it?  Oh, right.  Yeah.  That was the only movie that she just went, well, fuck it.  Wow.  Oh, Chloe, uh, 70.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Unbelievable.  That was her man.  That was her real boyfriend.  Yeah, yeah.  What's his name again?  I forgot.  Gallo.  Gallo.  Vince Gallo.  Yeah, there you go.  Yeah, the king of independent films.  Yeah, that's seen as a... 
[02:25:30]  And hair lips.  As real as it comes.  And what?  Hair lips.  Yeah, hair lips.  Yeah, look at his...  Snap.  I didn't know that.  Suck my cock.  Snap, snap.  Snap, snap.  Buffalo 60s snake.  Snap, snap, snap, snap.  I just would have thought Joaquin would have been king of the hair lips, though.  By the way...  He does.  Jason from Rye has a great observation.  Why the fuck is Bob Kelly explaining everything?  The star of the movie is sitting right next to him.  You dope.  Yeah, and Bob's explaining it. 
[02:26:00]  Well, I just figured I'd help him.  He's probably tired from doing radio.  Yep.  I was just trying to help him out.  He just saw it.  I just saw the movie, you jackass.  What are you adding to the show?  As opposed to being in it.  You saw it.  Fucking antenna breaks.  Fat fuck.  Dude, we've told everyone else that is associated with Grindhouse.  The people...  A lot of us have seen the movie around here.  We absolutely loved it.  Thank you.  The early reviews are great.  You guys are going to kick ass at the box office.  You're the star planter, the first feature, the double feature.  And the movie starts with Rose McGowan with one of the hottest scenes I've ever seen in a real movie. 
[02:26:30]  Right.  Not talking porn and stuff.  And she never gets officially naked.  She's a stripper.  Just working her body.  The music's perfect.  Just how the whole scene was filmed.  Yeah.  She sticks her tongue on a mirror, so it looks like she's licking another girl's tongue, but it's her tongue.  And it's just like the guys in the theater, when I went to see it, I was with Jimmy and his girl and a few other people.  Everyone was just trying to control themselves because they were there with chicks.  Right.  Just losing their minds. 
[02:27:00]  And that's how the thing opens.  Yeah.  And then it's just an all-out Freddy Rodriguez versus the world of zombies.  Yeah.  Yeah, it was cool for me, man.  It was the first time I've ever played an action hero.  And I've been here a few times.  I've been here promoting stuff, and you've seen some of my other stuff.  And as you see, it's a much different character than I've ever played.  So I was just honored that someone like Robert, who always does these badass films, always has a badass action hero, anti-hero in his film, chose me. 
[02:27:30]  And so I was really pleased with the way it came out, man.  Let me ask.  Wasn't it one of the most original movie experiences that you've had in a while?  Absolutely.  I mean, you see both, and the fake trailers in between and all that.  The fake trailers were, I want to see some of those movies now.  Yeah.  That's what those guys should do is not making them into movies.  Yeah.  I think it'll all depend on whether the movie does well this weekend.  I think if it does well, if it does well overall, I think it's going to spark a whole new genre of movies.  How's Robert to work with? 
[02:28:00]  Cool.  Yeah, he's great, man.  Yeah.  You know what was especially cool?  Well, first of all, watching Robert work is incredible.  This guy edits his own films.  He directs them.  Yeah.  He's the DP.  He's the music composer.  I mean, he fucks the stars.  I know.  Oh, shit.  He's banging around.  He's laughing.  Thank God.  I was a little scared to go with that line, but there were a few things written in the papers.  We're just pissed off because the day after he was in, there's a huge story in page six 
[02:28:30]  of the post about how he's, quote, banging Rose McGowan and left his wife of, like, 80  years and there are five or six kids behind.  He said, I have that ass.  Yeah, this big story came out in the paper.  It's like, what the hell is going on?  Why couldn't we have this a day earlier?  Oh, well.  But anyway, he's having a good time.  Yeah, he does everything.  Yeah.  And that's got to be a little intimidating.  Yeah.  Well, this guy, he's like George Lucas, man.  I mean, this guy owns his own sound stages, his own studio. 
[02:29:00]  I mean, he's 100% self-sufficient.  Yeah.  You know, 100% away from the studio system in Hollywood.  I mean, it's incredible to see this.  Great freedom to have.  Yeah, yeah.  That must be a bitch, though, if you're, like, the editor and he's kind of over your  shoulder.  Right.  Because, you know, it's like, what does this fucking guy know?  I'm the editor.  Yeah.  The guy has edited his own movies.  Yeah.  He knows how to do this very well.  Right.  Isn't George Lucas one of his mentors, too, I was reading?  Well, I know.  Yeah.  I think George Lucas is the guy who made him go digital or something like that. 
[02:29:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Showed him digital and convinced him to go digital.  Yeah.  I just want to shake George Lucas's neck.  I just want to grab it.  He doesn't look like the waddle there.  Yeah, just like the waddle.  Go in there.  He looks like one of the characters in the bar.  Now, doesn't he look like one of them?  He's not like one of the curses.  He's been cursed.  He wanted fame and fortune.  He made a deal with the devil, and the deal is he has to look like one of his characters  as he gets older. 
[02:30:00]  Digital remastered Star Wars.  Can you do that to his neck?  Just paint it green.  That's all he's got to do, and film himself in front of a green screen.  How many billion is that guy worth?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, man.  He's getting cut off.  Keeps all his bank statements in his pelican neck.  Oh, man.  Come on.  That's bad.  It's George Lucas.  Yeah, like I'm going to make a dent in anything that is self-esteem.  Oh, everything was fine until Anthony says that.  I got to tell you, because, you know, Garnhouse has such a buzz, and we get Robert in and Quentin 
[02:30:30]  Tarantino.  We were all, like, kind of, like, hoping we were going to get discovered when they were  in.  Oh, really?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  We were working it to the limit.  When you think of these indie guys and, you know, guys that really pretty much started  out, I mean, Robert with the goddamn wheelchair dolly.  That's a great story.  Yeah.  Quentin just, you know, throwing movies together when he was younger and just having a huge  success with Pulp Fiction and everything. 
[02:31:00]  You think, like, hey, maybe these guys got an eye, and they could just look around the  room and go, I think that guy had worked.  Like, so, you know, they discover you at a mulch shop like Mallory and Monroe.  So, you just, you know.  Yeah, I wasn't slouching that day.  I was showing him profiles.  Norton was actually doing scenes from Lucky Louie.  Oh, yeah.  Norton was overacting.  Ant was showing his knowledge of, like, everything.  I was trying to outdo Quentin Tarantino as far as, like, old TV knowledge from the 70s  and stuff, and you just get beaten down.  Oh, you can't beat that guy.  Nah.  Ant held his own.  He's being humble. 
[02:31:30]  You held your own.  I've spent a lot of time just plopped in front of the television during my youth.  Ant's head isn't as big as Tarantino's.  No.  That's full of movie knowledge.  He's got a huge melon.  That is full of fucking movie knowledge, though.  Yeah, he's incredible.  I think you realize when you're talking to these guys that you just must look like Ralph  Cram.  That, Mr. Faber-Sham, do you think I'm doing that play?  It's out of the question.  Out of the question.  It's cool to watch them two work together, too.  You know?  Yeah.  I mean, these guys, you know, you just don't know what to expect from two people who have 
[02:32:00]  achieved the notoriety that they have, you know?  So, you walk on set and you just, you don't know what to expect.  But these guys are like first-time filmmakers.  And people always ask me, oh, is Quentin really crazy or is Robert?  I'm like, no, man.  Those guys are just happy to be doing what they're doing, you know?  They're just enthusiastic about what they're doing.  Yeah.  You know?  So into it, man.  You talk to Quentin and it's like day one of making a movie.  Oh, yeah.  Totally, man.  It's like he's just realized he can make movies.  He's still so fucking pumped up and passionate about it. 
[02:32:30]  He is.  Great to see.  When we're on set, that stuff just trickles down to everyone else and everyone else becomes  pumped, too.  I mean, these guys, they have the formula locked down.  I mean, you know, I see why all their films are successful, but you just spend the first  ten minutes in a room with them and you see why they're the geniuses that they are.  How psyched were you when you got the call?  When he was like, you got it.  Right, right.  You flip out the, I don't know.  Nothing's ever happened to me.  I got a comedy sent to a premium blend and I jumped up and I'm like, ow, stupid. 
[02:33:00]  Yeah, Jerry Seinfeld talked to you.  I did just get a half hour.  Well, this is how it went down, right?  Robert called and he said, yeah, you know, I want you to come down and audition for it,  right?  He sent me one scene.  That's it.  Didn't tell me what the character was.  Didn't even tell me what the story was.  Nothing, right?  And I read it and I said, and it was the first scene of the film.  You remember when he walks in and he sees Rose's character and they sit down?  Absolutely, yeah.  So, you know, nothing's really revealed there.  And so, you know, I came in and I said, you know, this guy's probably a badass, you know?  So I wore this cool leather jacket, spiked up my hair, man. 
[02:33:30]  I had this like, you know, hair on my chin and I did it.  And at that time, he only had about 30 pages written of the script, right?  So after my audition, it inspired him to write the rest of the character and the rest of the  script, you know, and everybody else's audition too, you know?  And so, you know, he said, yeah, you got it.  I didn't know what it was about.  And we all went in to meet and he sent me the script.  And I remember reading the script the night before and thinking, wow, man, I cannot believe  I'm going to play this freaking action hero, you know? 
[02:34:00]  And later he just said, yeah, man, you came in and you freaking played in a badass.  I said, yeah, he should be a badass.  And so the jacket that you see in the movie is really my jacket.  Oh, okay.  He said, bring the jacket you wore at the audition.  You're going to wear it in the film.  You know, bring the pants, the shirt, the boot, everything, you know?  So everything you see, the hair, the thing is what I wore.  He's obviously got some vision there, man.  By the way, we got to bring it up.  Last time Freddie was here, people are acknowledging this.  I'm not going to lie to you, Freddie.  We didn't really know what to do with you.  So the interview turned out being Jim Norton taking the worst shit ever. 
[02:34:30]  Oh, my God.  That's right.  As we're trying to interview him.  I forgot about that.  He came in to promote Poseidon, which I ended up seeing afterwards.  And you had a great death scene in that movie there.  Yeah, it was cool.  The elevator shaft got you.  Right.  Wow.  Yeah.  Beheaded.  Yeah, that man was beheaded in a movie.  Wasn't pretty.  It was not pretty at all.  Yeah, but Kurt Russell bought it, though, in that.  And that was, like, horrible.  Yeah, it wasn't.  It was disturbing to watch him.  Oh, God, to watch him drown. 
[02:35:00]  Yeah, but his was, like, kick him off.  It was, like, imagine hearing that.  Kick him off.  You're, like, he's got me.  I got his foot.  Now pull us all up.  And you kick him off.  And you're, like, oh, and you see the gay guy just start kicking you.  Get off.  Get the Mexican guy off me.  Richard Dreyfuss.  You know, what was his name?  The gay guy.  The gay guy.  Richard Dreyfuss.  Yeah, this is our third movie together, me and Kurt Russell.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's third.  I actually, I'm not going to say I got him this film, but, yeah, he told the story last 
[02:35:30]  night on Jimmy Kimmel.  He, Mickey Rourke was supposed to play his role originally in Quentin's film.  And then it didn't work out with Mickey, and Quentin was, like, well, how's Kurt to work  with, man?  And he's just, you know, one of the coolest guys I've ever worked with.  He said, get me Kurt's numbers.  I called Kurt in Tahiti.  I said, hey, man, Quentin's going to call you.  I think he wants you to do it.  And, anyway, long story short.  Is that how that shit happens?  Yeah, it is.  God damn.  Hey, I'm in Tahiti.  Yeah, Quentin's going to call you.  Got a movie.  I saw his agent on a plane not too long ago. 
[02:36:00]  I said, hey, man, I'm taking 10% of that check, man.  I got him there.  Yeah, right.  I got Colin Quinn of college last week.  That's great, Pop.  Anyway.  I was actually mentioning the Jerry Seinfeld thing, because I'd seen the Jerry Seinfeld HBO,  where they kind of give mackalades and stuff, and he rips apart award shows and all that  shit.  And I could not, I can't look at Jerry Seinfeld anymore without thinking about your encounter 
[02:36:30]  with him at the Cellar.  Yeah.  This guy was, the thought that Jerry Seinfeld was saying hi to him.  Yeah, he was, Jerry Seinfeld was at the top of the stairs, like, stairs, and he's talking  down, and Bob is at the bottom of the stairs, and Bob's a comic, so he goes, hey, when you're  done, come on up here, and, you know, I got a table up here, and we'll just hang out and  talk.  And Bob is looking up at him at the stairs, and he goes, okay, and Jerry Seinfeld looks  at him and goes, not you.  He's talking to somebody behind him.  How fucking embarrassing is that? 
[02:37:00]  Not you.  To have Jerry Seinfeld look disgusted at you and go, not you.  Like, please step aside.  He was talking to the chick next to me, but there was a crowd of people just looking at  me like, eh, bleak.  But now you get on Instant Messenger, and ONA fans will, hey, man, Bobby, I've seen you.  You're the best.  And I'll type back, thanks a lot.  Not you.  Not you.  And they just sign off.  They won't let it go.  Was he an a-hole about it, though?  Or what, you know?  Yeah, well, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Actually, but I guess that, you know, I respect him, and I'm cool with it, because that's 
[02:37:30]  the way he is.  It's not like he became famous and was an asshole.  Right.  He's been an asshole since, you know, he was the day one.  You would officially call him an asshole, though?  I just did.  But, I mean, really?  That's what you heard?  I kind of would.  If he was here right now?  No, I heard he's, you know.  No, I know.  I heard he's, yeah, I talked to Quinn about it.  He's like, Quinn actually talked to him about it.  He goes, you said that to Bob.  And he was like, yeah, so?  Yeah, huh?  And Quinn was like, that's just the way he is.  It always has been.  He's been that way.  And I talked to everybody at the cellar.  I was like, yeah, he's just been that way.  That's him, so you've got to kind of respect him. 
[02:38:00]  Remember meeting him outside of the Italian place?  He's really hard to read.  And we got introduced, and it's like, this is Opie and Anthony from our agent, some other  agents introducing each other.  And then we shook his hand, and he goes, oh, yeah, yeah, okay, yeah.  And all I thought is like, he's just thinking, oh, radio people.  Right.  A cop was giving him a ticket out in front of the cellar, and the cop said, she said,  that's Jerry Seinfeld's car.  And he goes, oh, well, tell him, come on, give me an autograph. 
[02:38:30]  I'll erase the ticket.  She went in, she goes, Jerry, a cop's giving me a ticket, because he just parks his Porsche  right up.  Yeah, he doesn't care.  And she goes, all you have to do is just, come on, he just wants an autograph, and she  goes, tell him to give me the ticket.  Yeah.  That's what he said.  Wow.  There's more video of him getting tickets than any other celebrity.  Like all those paparazzi and all those celebrity shows where they have video of, you know,  drunks, bitches coming out with their twat showing.  Then they'll cut to like, and Jerry Seinfeld gets another ticket. 
[02:39:00]  There he is, getting into his car.  TMZ.  Yeah.  TMZ.com.  TMZ.com.  He's like, eh, I'm worth $300 million.  Yeah, this really isn't going to be much.  So he hires one person to take care of his parking tickets.  That's their whole job.  Yeah.  Charlie in Jersey, what's up?  Hey, Freddy, I was in Vienna, Austria for New Year's, and you can't believe how big Six  Feet Under is over there.  I mean, they only get a DVD at a time, so they have to space out.  They have viewings.  People pile into houses.  I mean, just go to Europe, dude.  You rule there. 
[02:39:30]  Really?  You rule there.  You know, there's a show that always, every once in a while it comes on, and I'm bummed  out that I didn't watch it, and one of them is Six Feet Under.  Never watched.  Yeah.  I watched it.  Freddy was in Six Feet Under as well.  I know.  I'll tell you what Six Feet Under, I didn't want to watch, because the Sopranos are on.  Everyone rins.  Then this came on, and you get a, I'm telling you, you get sucked.  You just get sucked into the show.  Yeah, those shows have a formula.  But it's just creepy, man.  That'll just make you addicted to it and stuff.  Because now, what's his name?  Train wreck.  From Six Feet Under is in Dexter. 
[02:40:00]  Yeah, Michael Seahawks.  Dexter's great.  Yeah.  And that's another one that kind of sucks you in.  And then Stupid Than gives me the first season of Lost.  And I'm just like, all right, let me pop in a couple.  And then by the second DVD, you're just, wah!  Ah!  It's midnight.  I got to be up at 4 a.m.  One more episode.  One more.  One more.  Because you try, it's like a Rubik's Cube now.  You're trying to figure it out.  Figure everything out.  Yeah, okay.  I know.  It's a monster that is made of smoke.  Derek is all, Derek is just like, I gave up because nothing happens.  I'm like, I just saw the first season. 
[02:40:30]  Shut up.  He's like, no, nothing gets resolved.  You could just, and stop watching it after the first season.  And the thing about my show, too, it's like a novel.  So if you don't watch it from the beginning, you try to watch it from the middle, you just  don't know what's happening.  Yeah, because you start out as like this perfect, perfect anal guy that just wants to make his  way up.  And then you turn into a dude who's banging strippers.  Yeah.  Oh, he winds up banging a stripper, gets caught, he's fucked, and then he gets thrown out.  Yeah.  He just, you know what I mean? 
[02:41:00]  He just wants everything back to the way it was, and he can't get there.  You just know everything about everything he's done, and you're willing to just discuss it.  Well, I tell everybody.  I'm a big fan.  I'm a big fan.  What have you seen?  Have you seen 16 Under?  No, actually, I haven't.  Have you seen 16 Under?  I just said I didn't.  That's how this whole thing started.  He was fantastic on it.  All right.  Let's say hi to Too Fat from Hoboken.  Too Fat, what's up?  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hey, how you doing?  Hey, Freddie, man.  Big fan, dude.  I just got the harsh times. 
[02:41:30]  I know it's probably not one of your best, most famous, known for movies, but I think you're  underrated, dude.  You're great.  Thank you, man.  I appreciate that.  I don't think he's going to be underrated after this Grindhouse.  I'll tell you right now.  He'll probably be part of that QT crew.  You know how these guys usually show up at his movies afterwards?  I hope you become part of the team, man, and good luck.  Punching up, boys.  All right.  Thank you.  Thank you, man.  There's a team?  Let's go to Randy in California.  Randy, boys, what?  I don't know.  Randy, what's up?  How you doing? 
[02:42:00]  Hey.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Hey, I'm a big fan of the show.  Freddie, I watched 16 Under from the very beginning, and I saw Grindhouse last night here in California.  Oh, you did?  It's a total opposite acting.  I mean, you're a good actor, but you're a great actor, and I just want to let you know.  Thank you, man.  I appreciate it.  Yeah, he's an action hero in Death Proof, which is the first feature of Grindhouse.  I can't believe it.  Planet Terror.  I'm sorry.  Planet Terror.  It's so different from his role as, you know, from Six Feet Under, and it's, I mean, you're  a great actor in that, but it's just, oh my God, it's totally different. 
[02:42:30]  Thank you.  Did you love Grindhouse?  Loved it, man.  I loved it.  Like I said, the three hours was no big deal at all.  It's just like, I'm 43, and it's just like being back in the theater as a kid.  Yeah.  That's what bothered me, too, at first.  I'm like, it's three hours?  I'm like, ugh.  I can't remember the last time I sat in a theater for three hours, and I told Quentin when we met  him, I'm like, it was the easiest three hours.  Yeah, yeah.  That's what it was great about.  No one was bitching about how long.  No, no.  Oh, my God, because sometimes you sit through a three-hour movie, and you know that was  a three-hour movie.  Fuck, man. 
[02:43:00]  Get me out of this.  As a kid, you sit through a movie for three hours, I mean, watching movies, but as an adult,  you're, I mean, 20 minutes, you want to get out of there, but anyway, it was great.  All right, cool, man.  Thanks, Randy.  Brunkus.  Brunkus, yes.  Brunkus.  Let's say hi to Michael in Texas.  Michael, what's up?  Hey, love you guys.  Love the show.  Bobby, you're fucking great.  Freddie, I saw Grindhouse premiere in Austin last week.  Oh, you went.  Yeah, yeah.  We drove down from Dallas.  It's fucking amazing.  Thank you, man.  And I thought Rose was going to be the big shining star, because she was prominent in 
[02:43:30]  both parts of the movie, but you really blew me away in Planet Terror.  Thank you, man.  I didn't expect El Rey to just take over, and that was great.  Thank you, man.  Thank you so much.  I appreciate that.  The zombie show was just amazing.  Amazing.  How do you hook up with her?  All right, Michael.  At the beginning, does she have a no leg through the whole movie?  No.  Okay.  About, what, halfway through or something?  Well, yeah, a little longer than that is.  But when it comes on, man, it comes on.  Well, I was just wondering if he hooked up with a chick.  All right. 
[02:44:00]  I mean, there's a big difference between, all right, I met this chick when she had two legs,  and then she lost one, as opposed to, I was fucking this chick when she had one leg.  Dude, she's so hot in this movie, you don't care that she is missing a leg.  How do they fucking, it looks so real.  It's fucked up what they can do now with the CGI and all that.  Yeah, man, that's Robert.  It's amazing.  That's Robert.  It's amazing.  Did she have to hop around on one leg?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, man, for four months.  She had to hop around on one leg.  Oof.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And you can't tell. 
[02:44:30]  You would, if you didn't know this actress, you'd think they got, obviously, an actress with  one leg.  That's fucking crazy.  Yeah, it's kind of, I don't understand, because of the older movies, you always could tell  a little bit, a little bit.  Yeah, a little toe sticking out of the ass.  That's a dead giveaway every time.  Let's go to Chris in Houston.  Chris, what's up?  Hey, love you guys.  Love the show.  I just wanted to ask Freddie, man, I'm a big fan of his, been a fan of his ever since 
[02:45:00]  he was in Can't Hardly, waiting for that annoying sidekick guy.  But what's next for you, man?  It's almost like you're becoming like the new John Leguizamo, man.  The new John Leguizamo.  Oh, wow.  What happened to the old one?  Where'd he go?  I don't know, dude.  Yeah, I'm about to sign on to something pretty soon.  I can't say now, but, you know, I put out four movies last year, you know, one this  year, five seasons of my show.  So, you know, Grindhouse was so exhausting for me that I took a little break after that. 
[02:45:30]  But I'm about to start something pretty soon.  Why was it exhausting, by the way?  I had, you know, we shot the whole thing at night, right?  So, like, for four months, I was nocturnal.  It was like from 7 p.m. to 7 a.m. I would work.  And then I had months of training for that film, you know, to accomplish all the fight  sequences and the knife sequences and the gun sequences and then just physical training  as well because I'd take my shirt off in the film.  So, you know, you mix that with filming at night and working 15 hours a day, man, that  thing would just burn you out. 
[02:46:00]  And then I did, you know, four other movies before that and five seasons of my show.  I was just burnt, man.  Did you know how to handle a gun before the movie?  No, zero, man.  I've never even held a gun, a real gun before that film.  That sounds like a whatever question, but when you see Grindhouse, you're like, well,  fuck, man.  Do they give him a gun in the crib?  Like, he does things with a gun you've never seen before.  He gives you gun lessons.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And you pulled it off like you knew your way around it.  Yeah.  That's something you brought up where you said, you know, if you've got to take your shirt  off, you've got to work out. 
[02:46:30]  Yeah.  To that point.  But in the old movies, like, they didn't care.  It's so funny when you watch, like, an old Chuck Heston movie.  I was going to go with John Wayne or Charles Heston.  And they take their shirt off and they're supposed to be in shape.  Yeah.  And they're sucking it in.  And they just got these big barrels that they're trying to hide everything.  It's so funny.  These old guys just didn't realize.  And they weren't old guys back then.  They were just so fucking out of shape.  Smoking.  Yeah.  Drinking every night.  All those guys.  Looks like their skin's just filled with jello. 
[02:47:00]  They have one rib.  That's what it looks like.  One giant rib.  One big rib.  And everything's...  They're trying so hard to suck it in.  They got flabby tits and stuff.  Just staring.  Filoni tits.  Dude.  You knew you were doing this fucking movie.  You couldn't stay out.  No.  No.  Keep from going out one night.  Maybe do a couple of crunches or something.  That's a great, great observation.  It was a miracle.  They used to pound back then too hard.  Really?  Yeah.  You see their faces.  They all look bloated.  You know how when you pound all night, your face is bloated.  Your eyes are bloated. 
[02:47:30]  Oh, they were out just banging Hollywood starlets, drinking with each other, and God knows what  else.  Getting home at all hours.  And then, you know, they'd go to the set, do their movie, and like you said, they're all  bloated, hungover.  The only ones that were in shape were the gay ones.  Like Rock Hudson was...  He had abs.  Smoking.  Even him.  When he takes it off.  All those guys.  Like Burt Lancaster.  Yeah.  He's playing like, you know, hey, Spartacus, one of those movies.  And just a wreck.  Yeah, they allowed it though.  That's the thing is that, you know, the studio system allowed it back then. 
[02:48:00]  Yeah.  Now, she...  You better whip your ass in a fucking shape or you're off the picture.  Yeah, if they even think you were drinking the night before, man, you are out, dude.  I mean, it's so strict now.  Oh, no kidding.  Oh, heck yeah.  Well, Lindsay Lohan gets a little fucking breather though on that stuff.  Yeah, well, you know, she's 19, 20.  But if she was 25, 30 doing that, she'd be out, dude.  Yeah.  Big time.  Ooh.  That happens.  What are you...  Were you Mexican?  Puerto Rican.  Puerto Rican.  Yeah.  All right. 
[02:48:30]  That was a big difference.  Mexicans, the accent is very...  That could be the most amazing question that we've had so far.  Mexicans are very...  What are you...  What are you...  Well, when I used to go on...  I'm Irish, believe it or not.  Oh, right.  That's what your adopted parents are.  I used to go on auditions.  I'm Irish now, too.  No, Colin Quinn says that my great-great-grandmother was raped by a Chechnyan on the Khyber Pass.  Holy fucking Colin can come up with that.  Chechnyan and Khyber.  Go fuck yourself, Quinn.  What was his Buddha line about you backstage at the Halloween show? 
[02:49:00]  I don't know.  I don't know what the fuck was it.  I don't know, but he had a grass skirt on.  I said, that's his Comedy Central Tough Crowd contract.  He had a little shredded.  No, I was just asking, because...  I mean, you know, Rodriguez is Mexican, right?  Yeah, he is.  Yeah, he's Mexican, right?  Yeah.  And when I was in L.A., I used to go on auditions.  My agent used to throw me on Spanish auditions all the time.  Yeah.  And it would be...  But it was...  I had to learn Spanish.  Like, there'd be, like, a whole Spanish scene. 
[02:49:30]  Oh, you mean...  So I'd be out talking to the gardener, dude.  Like, dude, what's this mean?  He's like, that means you have to say it like this.  And I'd have to rehearse all these Spanish lines.  And then you go in, and it's all Spanish dudes, and they speak Spanish, and they come  out, Robert, Kelly, and they all just stare at me like, who the fuck did they just say?  And then, you know, and I'm just like...  You can pass, though.  Yeah, you can kind of look the part.  I can pass until I talk, and then I sound like a hump from fucking Long Island.  Right.  The line was, Bob Kelly looks like a last-minute gift at a Chinese airport. 
[02:50:00]  That's fucking great.  Who got that?  That was Colin.  Who just ripped that out, though?  Dan remembered, or somebody in the other room.  Danny.  If it's an insult, someone in this room will remember.  You were insulted.  A Buddha figurine or something, he said.  No, I got it.  Yeah.  I know.  I'm just, like, making sure it hurts a little more.  Just driving the knife in a little deeper.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Giving it a twist.  He kind of ruined it when you said figurine.  Figurine.  Figurine.  Anything but een should be at the end of what Bob Kelly looks like.  Jesus Christ.  I'm sorry. 
[02:50:30]  Anything.  No een or et.  I know.  I'm a fucking real.  You're not a men's weekly ass face.  Hey.  Working on it.  I'm not ready to take my shirt off for a movie.  We both look like we're in a hunting magazine.  What?  I don't know.  All right.  We should get Freddy out of here.  Big freaking movie star.  Do you have anything else going on tonight?  God damn, man.  No, it's just that, man.  I'm actually catching a flight back to L.A. today.  Congratulations.  Yeah, yeah.  Thank you so much, man.  The star of Planet Terror, the first movie of Grindhouse.  It opens tomorrow.  Get recognized a lot at the airports and stuff. 
[02:51:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, I got to dinner and all that.  Yeah, but people are usually real cool.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, people come up to you and say, man, you look like Rick Delgado.  Rick Delgado is our old producer.  I just want to make people laugh around here, too.  He's our old producer.  You look exactly like our old producer.  Do I really?  And trust me, he wanted to do what you're doing.  Hey.  And that's why he's our old producer.  Oh.  Oh.  Ouch.  Thanks a lot, guys.  Hey, Freddy Rodriguez.  Thanks for coming in.  Thanks.  The star of Planet Terror.  Opening Friday.  It's part of Grindhouse.  The movie's Grindhouse, Grindhouse, Grindhouse. 
[02:51:30]  And if that stupid Ice Cube movie outgrosses Grindhouse, I'm going to fucking go on a shooting spree.  I don't want to see that.  Nice meeting you, man.  Take it easy, man.  All right.  That's got the world by the balls right now.  Yeah.  Nice.  We showed you respect today there, Freddy.  No Norton shitting during the interview, because you're in a real movie now.  If you want to see Norton shit, though, go to Miami Beach.  Huh?  Going to be at the Improv.  Yeah.  Coconut Grove.  Poseidon sucked, by the way. 
[02:52:00]  I liked it.  I liked it, too.  Are you crazy?  It was almost a really good movie.  Dude.  Almost a really good movie.  Let me tell you something.  If there wasn't an original, and I'm not even saying the original was a great movie, but  if there wasn't an original Poseidon Adventure, that movie really would have been like, wow,  this is fantastic fucking ship disaster movie.  I love how Anthony's trying to just sidetrack him from fucking ruining what just happened  in here.  He's been my whole fucking career, Bob.  Yeah, but I don't like it. 
[02:52:30]  Let O.B.  He do what he does.  I want to be uncomfortable.  I want to be uncomfortable.  It was almost a great movie.  It didn't suck.  You go, it was good.  You know what?  And you pauses.  As soon as you knew they booked Richard Dreyfuss for a show, duh.  It's not coming here to promote an Oscar winner.  We're not going to get Richard Dreyfuss unless it's a bomb that they need to work the movie  I don't think anyone thought it was going to be an Oscar winner.  I don't think anyone thought Poseidon was going to be an Oscar winner. 
[02:53:00]  But as far as a remake of the Poseidon adventure, I thought it was very cool.  The CGI looked great.  Oh, really?  It was CGI.  It was great.  Go fuck yourself, Anthony.  I laughed.  I cried.  I felt good about myself.  I did like it, but now I'm with O.B.  It fucking stinks.  I'll tell you.  Richard Dreyfuss was downright creepy in the movie as an old queen.  Freddy Rodriguez had an amazing part and an amazing death scene.  He's now gone, so I'm not kissing his ass. 
[02:53:30]  As you see, he's not anywhere near here.  And Kurt Russell's death scene was unbelievable.  But then there was like...  Kurt Russell was cool in the whole movie.  Yeah, but you've got to give it up.  Just his death scene.  The rogue wave was unbelievable.  I'm into rogue waves.  Did you see Deadly Catch?  The rogue wave?  Did you see that the other day?  Dude, someone dies on Deadliest Catch this season.  I just found that out the other day.  Two people died last season.  Oh, I didn't know that.  The whole ship went down in the first season.  Yeah, but this last season, there was a rogue wave.  The guy's on the deck, and all of a sudden, the whole boat is on its side. 
[02:54:00]  You can see the wave come in, the shadow.  It's just crazy fucking people to take that job.  I'd love to see a bee on a boat with a rogue wave.  Rogue wave.  Yeah, it just sounds good.  Kurt Russell was good in the movie.  They just need a little...  What was there missing?  A little more storyline.  There were some great scenes in the original Poseidon.  What?  I don't know.  They just built up the suspension.  You didn't feel enough for the characters?  No, not really.  Was that it?  No, not at all.  You didn't get freaked out when they had to swim to get to that thing. 
[02:54:30]  And the kid had to stick his hand up with a cross.  Absolutely, but in the original, when they went for that swim underwater, it was just...  There, see, I'm getting the nod from the father out there with the daughter that likes to talk about it.  He just nods.  That guy just nods.  He's not nodding at you.  Oh, oh, face.  Hey, the father's giving me a thumbs up.  He even knows.  He's being nice.  He can't get that from me.  No, we'll talk to them after the break.  From Louisiana, and he's from somewhere else. 
[02:55:00]  You guys...  Louisiana, too?  Louisiana.  Louisiana.  But you live up here, or you're working up here?  I'm working up here.  Okay, we'll get into what they're all about next.  Yeah, see what the hell that's all about.  Huh?  Is he an old wrestling coach?  Wrestling coach.  Some of the slow scenes in the Poseidon really made the movie, though.  Like, the new Poseidon, I think they felt like no one wants to sit through, like, a real storyline and dialogue.  They just wanted action, action, action.  Well, you watch those old Irwin Allen disaster movies, and they fucking stink. 
[02:55:30]  The whole buildup of the characters is most of the movie.  And then the disaster part is the end.  And coincidentally enough, I just saw, last weekend, Airport 79, The Concord.  Ooh.  Starring OJ?  No, OJ wasn't in that one.  OJ was in Towering Inferno?  I forgot which one.  John Davidson was in it.  Okay.  I'm trying to think.  There was the old lady.  She was in it.  And then George, what's his name? 
[02:56:00]  The guy that's in every single one of them.  George, I don't know.  He's the guy that was the mechanic in the first one, that had the cigar and was trying to rock the 707 out of the snow like it was an old Chevy.  I hope he had a mood swing half through Freddy's interview, and he hasn't been back since.  I was in a really bad mood yesterday.  I'm fine today.  I just went like this way.  He's writing it down.  Huh?  Kennedy?  George Kennedy.  George Kennedy.  George Kennedy.  He worked his way up through. 
[02:56:30]  He was in every one of those fucking movies.  And he finally worked his way up where he was the mechanic in the first one.  Yeah.  And he's the pilot in this one.  It's like, what the fuck?  It's like he was promoted throughout all the airport movies.  You know, I think in Airport 78, he was like a ticket person.  He was getting promotions.  He kept getting promotions.  He was getting movie promotions.  So he's the pilot.  And this movie was so fucking bad that they had to do some kind of landing in the snow.  And they landed. 
[02:57:00]  They got everyone out.  And the plane blew up in, I swear, four minutes.  The whole thing happened in four minutes.  The big climax.  And then the credits start rolling.  Like, they ran out of film.  Like, they fucking ran.  I'm watching the movie going, people actually walked out of a movie.  And I picture, like, the credits rolling and people getting up in a movie theater because  this was out in a fucking movie theater.  Right, right, right.  And going like, that was great.  Wasn't that a good movie?  And thinking, how did people watch fucking movies like this back then? 
[02:57:30]  It probably wasn't a great movie back then.  It was back then.  Like, people talked about it.  The problem is, back then you had nothing really to compare it to.  Like, now when you see an old movie, you compare it to all the great stuff they're doing now.  If you were sitting in a movie theater and Airport 79, the Concord's on, and it ends,  you're in the theater yelling,  Are you fucking kidding me?  All right, this is what we're going to do when we get back because I'm on the same line as you know.  When we get back, movies where you actually yelled at the screen and went,  Yelling, go, what, huh?  Like, I told the story, I saw The Village back in the day a few years ago, 
[02:58:00]  and the credits start rolling, and a guy just stands up in front of everybody and goes,  That was bullshit!  And the whole place just starts applauding because they were all thinking it,  but were too scared to say anything.  Yeah.  Like, what the fuck?  That was bullshit!  I'll give you one right now.  New movie came out a while ago.  No, new movie came out a while ago.  New movie came out like a few months ago, I guess.  Maybe.  Who decided? 
[02:58:30]  The Fountain.  The Fountain.  The fuck is The Fountain?  It's got fucking Wolverine in it.  Ask the faggot.  So I watched it.  It's about, it's about, well, the way the trailer looked,  it looked like a cool kind of time thing where they find the Fountain of Youth,  which turns out to be a fucking tree or something,  and then he's living, like, up until the future.  You know, so I like time fucking shit like that.  It turns into this dopey chick flick type sci-fi thing,  that makes no sense, and ended, when it ended, I'm sitting there going, 
[02:59:00]  what?  Are you shitting me?  No answers, no nothing.  We could get into that after the break.  And also, someone is claiming they have the best midget sighting ever.  We take your phone call, but I got to take a leak.  Who saw that coming?  I got to, I got to, I got to, I got to, you know.  You got to take a piss.  Oh, that hurt you.  Of course.  I have to take a leak so bad, my body temperature just dropped.  Oh, really?  It's like you're full of antifreeze.  Oh, my, yeah. 
[02:59:30]  Hey, whoo, Cunningham, I'm gay.  I just bonked mouth.  He said sit on it, so I did.  Hey, that's pretty cool.  From this week's Steppin' Out magazine, Club Soda Kenny sent this over to us.  There's a column called 24-7 by Dan Lorenzo. 
[03:00:00]  I guess he listens to our show.  He's kind of a fan of the show, I believe.  Wasn't he not a fan of the show, and we bashed him once?  I don't know.  I think.  I can't remember.  If that's not the truth, then I apologize to him.  We end up having a problem with everyone.  I don't know.  It's just the nature of what we do, I guess.  And then some people are cool again.  Some hate us forever.  It's just a whole freaking circus.  But he writes in his column this week, kudos to Opie from Opie and Anthony for something  he said on one of last week's shows.  Opie said that Howard Stern's girlfriend, Beth-O, is not a model. 
[03:00:30]  Opie said she's got a horse mouth.  He's right.  Beth looks pretty good compared to normal girls, but she certainly isn't a model by  any stretch of the imagination.  I like the fact that she is an animal rights person, but I don't think she'd be having  sex with Howard if he made $35,000 a year.  Come on.  Be honest, Beth.  Yeah.  That's pretty cool.  Midget sighting?  We interrupt this program to bring you the ozone midget sighting of the day. 
[03:01:00]  Deliah?  Deliah?  Hello?  No one saw this coming.  What's up, Deliah?  I had the best midget sighting ever.  Oh, my gosh.  Oh, she's excited.  I wanted to call last week, but I'm never up in the morning, so I'm finally up to give  you guys a call.  So anyway, I'm a banquet bartender, and I'm working some stupid foundation at a country  club.  Wait, you're a what bartender?  A banquet bartender. 
[03:01:30]  Oh, banquet.  I thought she was saying a banging.  No.  Like, she's really hot.  A banquet bartender.  Oh, yeah, I'm hot, too.  She's hot, too.  Yeah, I'm hot.  I'm a hot bartender, but I work at like a...  Wait, what makes you hot, though?  Wait a minute.  We got three guys right here that will determine if you're hot or not.  Opie has a...  What the hell's wrong?  Opie has a button he can push so I can talk.  Yeah.  I'm sorry, man.  Opie has a mathematical equation to find out if you're hot, so you can't get by it.  All right, let's go.  What makes you hot there, Deliah?  I'm tall.  I'm like 5'10". 
[03:02:00]  I have long blonde hair, blue eyes.  I have really big boobs, and they're real.  How old are you?  I don't know.  24.  And how big are your boobs?  I don't know.  I squish them into a double day, but they're kind of squished.  Kind of squished.  What's the size?  Like 34, 36.  34.  No, that's your back.  I learned that a lot.  Yeah, you want to see if it's big, though.  Yeah, what's the cup size?  You squeeze into a double D.  That means you're into those freakish letters. 
[03:02:30]  Well, yeah, but like a double D works.  I just have a little bit of that, like, top.  No, hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  We did a whole segment on this, but Robert Kelly's laughing at me.  What's that freakish laughing?  All right, listen.  A zig-a-zag.  What do you think when you think A?  A cup.  Small.  Small.  Small.  Tiny.  All right, but you're not bothered by it or anything.  No.  B cup.  Nice.  C cup.  Perfect.  Full C cup.  Perfect.  Teenage full C cup.  Perfect.  Perfect.  Perfect. 
[03:03:00]  Hard on.  Right now.  D cup.  Dug-dugs.  Love them.  Double D.  Nice.  Fun.  Take one.  Shake it.  F cup.  F cup.  I'll fucking mush them together and sit on them.  Get a little bit.  That's where it gets like freakish letters where you're just thinking sloppy and thinking  other things.  Now it becomes.  After D and double D, it might be the greatest thing ever.  I don't know.  But don't they just stop with sizes?  You get that?  We have H cup Jane. 
[03:03:30]  She checks in from time to time and there was I cup Jan or something.  It doesn't sound as hot as D or double D.  Yeah.  It becomes like a problem, like an albatross.  Yeah.  It's like a big double D because like anything over a double D, like you can't get cute bras.  It's just kind of big.  It's purely utilitarian.  I don't have like big old nibbles.  If she wasn't so hot, we would have fucking hung up on this bra five minutes ago.  How annoying is this girl's voice?  All right.  She can hear us again.  So like I can see how it would be kind of big.  Yeah. 
[03:04:00]  Yeah.  Double D is like she said.  You could go to Frederick's of Hollywood or Vicky's and get something pretty.  Whereas when you get over that, it's just pure utilitarian like foundation, like straps  and like girders, like things on the bridge.  Yeah.  What do you think, Delar?  About what?  My boobs are the midget?  No.  What Ann was saying.  Yeah.  About the bras.  Oh, yeah.  Like anything like a double stater on either pan or flack and they feel like super fat 
[03:04:30]  sex and, you know, have like padded straps and more hooks on the back.  Like that's not sexy.  Bulba.  Not true.  Yeah.  Like you don't want to see that when you're like taking off your dress.  Oh, no kidding, man.  Oh, wow.  What kind of hot outfits do you squeeze into?  With that hot body of yours, 5'10", big, huge boobs.  I don't know.  Sex.  Like, I wear like, you know, low-cut shirts.  She can't hear us again.  I have like some fly.  This is why they don't have Q&A at strip clubs. 
[03:05:00]  You know?  Even though like I'm like real tall.  Listen to this mess.  This is the type where you just like shut up and get me my fucking drink so I can watch  the game.  I'm a hot jerk.  Shut up.  Yeah.  At a country club.  Oh, wait.  Like when I walk, like if I'm going out with like my friends or something.  She can't hear us again.  She's yapping.  She's yapping with somebody at the corner of the bar and you're just waiting for your fucking  beer, staring at her.  He doesn't care what you're saying.  I don't care what you're saying.  Get me my beer.  I don't care that you're going to do real estate.  Shut up.  Hate me.  Enough.  All right.  Oh, really?  They hate you, huh? 
[03:05:30]  Yeah.  Well, because like I'm noticeable.  I'm not like, you know.  Yeah, I bet.  I'm like an average chick who like, you know, can go like unnoticed.  Like, you're going to see me when I walk in.  So like, I got to be fierce.  Right.  Did you say fierce?  Fierce.  You're fierce?  What is fierce?  She's got balls.  What kind of guy is like...  Drag queen.  What kind of guy's hit on you?  Here she goes again.  I don't know.  A lot of black dudes dig me.  A lot of like, me-hat dudes dig me.  I hope a black dude gave you an ass cave. 
[03:06:00]  A lot of old dudes dig me.  A lot of old dudes dig me.  A lot of old dudes dig me.  I have an eclectic mix of dudes.  Yeah, that's cool.  Yeah, eclectic.  So like, black guys are after you?  Because that means, that could be something, you know what I mean?  Could mean that I'm fat.  Could mean big ass.  No, I don't have a big ass.  No?  No.  Describe your ass.  I had a really nice ass.  Here we fucking go again.  I do a lot of cardio.  Like, I go to yoga.  You can't hear us right now.  So.  Who else wants to see you take a fist in the ass?  I'm like that, like, you know.  Oh, shut up.  Extra, like, side battle. 
[03:06:30]  Shut the fuck up.  Where, like, your underwear will pinch off, like, ass ass.  Mm.  Not really?  Do you smoke Newports?  Yeah.  Do you smoke?  Do you drink?  Do you do drugs?  Do you, uh, what?  She has to drink.  She works at a bar.  I love learning about our listeners, especially the hot ones.  Coke.  Coke.  Coke.  I drink.  Um, sometimes, like, I'll smoke a little bit when I'm drinking, but I smoke pot.  Oh, shut up.  Oh, no.  Like, I'm on my way to work right now.  Yeah, like, like, like, like, like, like.  Huh.  But, like, as drugs go, like, you know, if my birthday is coming up, like, once, you know, 
[03:07:00]  once in a blue moon, I like to experiment with the hard stuff, but normally I just, like,  smoke a little pot.  I bet you do your size queen.  The hard stuff.  Oh, oh, yeah.  Really?  That's cool.  So, how long have you been, how long have you, I mean, is this what you're going to do  for your career?  Oh, no, no.  Yeah, what are your plans for, you know, a career or something when you're a camp bartender?  I'm almost done school.  I have, like, five classes left.  I'm going to get my degree in marketing.  Do you think we really gave it in general? 
[03:07:30]  What do you want to do with your life?  Do you think she's going to get a job after getting a marketing degree?  Dan from Toronto, enough, enough.  I want to smother my ears with a huge breast.  Oh, shut up.  Oh, really?  That's what you're doing for school?  You're trying to pay for school with a bartender?  Yeah.  Do you attend bar only at this place, or do you attend at a bar or something?  It's only, like, a private country club.  Oh, God.  Like, I cared about the question.  How stupid do you have to be not to be on to this by now, dumb blonde crap? 
[03:08:00]  She works at Bushwood, sir.  Oh, my God.  But, like, the money is good.  Lacey underalls.  Like, I'm never at work, you know, past one o'clock in the morning.  Like, like, like, like.  Uh-huh.  So, all right.  It's nice getting to know you a little bit.  Yeah, do you like movies and music and TV?  Like, what are some of your hobbies?  Um, well, I'm a writer, and I'm a speaker.  Oh, you are.  You have a blog on MySpace, you twat.  But I'm not, like, one of those, like.  Like, I went out, like, with my friends, and, like, I have big tits, like. 
[03:08:30]  Um, music.  I'm a writer.  Music.  I don't know.  I'm really into Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds right now.  Oh, yeah.  So interesting.  Wow, that's so cool for the room.  Kind of, like, I don't know, like, like, indie hip-hop and, like, you know.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  You're called, you know, like, white kid angst music.  Shut up.  This is what you got to deal with.  White kid angst music.  Yeah, that's cool.  That's interesting.  Yeah.  That must be a good conversation starter. 
[03:09:00]  Mm-hmm.  Wow.  Go out, you know, like.  Do you have a boyfriend right now?  Do you have a boyfriend, or were you seeing anybody, or?  Yeah.  Oh, God.  I don't want to talk about that.  Oh, come on.  That sounds interesting now.  Yeah, what happened to the boyfriend?  What happened?  I mean, he had a hot piece of ass like you, and you're good at the conversation.  You got the big boobies.  Who wouldn't want you?  I'll tell you.  Just about every single guy out there, when they hear her open her fucking mouth. 
[03:09:30]  Huh?  Like, I have, like, I'm over the boyfriend.  I have a good boyfriend.  Like, you know, he's a really nice guy.  Yeah.  But.  What makes him a nice guy?  Does he sit through this babble?  I don't know.  He's not, like, he's deathed.  He's respectful.  He nods his head, like, he has, you know, a good family, nice Irish Catholic boy with  a good job.  Good family.  The whole family wants to fuck her.  I don't know.  This is a friend.  The whole family wants to put cocks in her mouth to shut her up.  He doesn't light that fire. 
[03:10:00]  Oh, really?  Is this a boyfriend or just a friend?  It doesn't sound like you're talking about him like he's your boyfriend.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, he's my boyfriend.  That's pretty cool.  Sex and stuff?  But, like, even though he's my boyfriend, like, I use the term loosely.  Why?  Because it's.  Because some nights he's not my boyfriend.  Some nights I'm.  Oh.  Some nights he's just not my boyfriend.  Oh, I got you.  Are you?  So some nights maybe you're taking other guys home?  Actually, what Anthony wanted to ask, are you taking other cocks up the ass? 
[03:10:30]  Some nights he's out with his friends.  Some nights you're a slut.  He's like another hot piece comes along.  Big effing slut.  Yeah.  Hmm.  So that's interesting.  I like girls like that.  When was the last time that something like that happened?  Okay, well, I have a quick story if you want to hear it.  Yes.  Yeah.  It's the best cock-blocking story ever.  All right.  Ever?  Ever?  Ever.  Ever.  Okay.  So, okay.  So, I'm on like a family vacation.  We're having like a family reunion group thing. 
[03:11:00]  You know, there's like eight of us.  This is going to go on and on.  I wouldn't even listen to this until she was completely naked.  Fucking herself in a black dildo.  Dude, this will go on and on and go nowhere.  Of course.  What happened?  Where'd she go?  Delilah.  Hello?  Delilah.  That's her boyfriend just smacked the phone out of her hand.  Somebody.  Hey, what happened?  We had a good story.  Delilah.  Oh, can you hear me?  Please hear me.  Oh, we got you. 
[03:11:30]  Oh, my God.  We thought we lost you.  I don't even know what we heard last.  You were telling the best cock-blocking story ever.  Ever.  Okay.  Where were we when the phone hung up?  I don't know.  You should start over.  I'm sorry.  Yeah, start over.  If it's the greatest cock-blocking story, we got to hear from the beginning because I think  other girls will challenge your story to say it.  Yeah.  This is perfect for the Opie and Anthony show.  We hear you.  We hear you.  Oh, okay.  Okay.  All right.  So, tell us the story.  Taking off on runway seven, this babbling ass.  Yes, we're right here.  Yeah, we hear you.  We hear you perfectly clear now. 
[03:12:00]  Go ahead.  Okay.  So, I'm in Tampa and we're staying in the hotel.  Oh, God damn it.  The entire hotel, I swear to God.  Oh, yeah.  I swear to God.  It was the entire hotel and my friends.  And we went there.  And I had this one night stand with this guy.  And it was so hot.  So, I'm staying in the hotel with my dad and my stepmom.  And I'm like a hundred football players.  Fucking.  How?  I'm like, holy shit.  I'm all canned from the crew.  Ooh.  I'm strutting around in a bikini and heels and my little white dress looking like a 
[03:12:30]  stupid kid.  The whole team.  How about banging the whole team?  So, I meet this guy, Philippe, from like Paris.  And he's like, so nice.  Philippe from Paris?  Shut up.  That pretentious whore.  You know what?  I hope, fuck this cunt.  I hope Sam Jackson chains her to his fucking house.  Fucking cunt. 
[03:13:00]  Stupid Philippe.  It was Philippe.  And like Philippe came out of her from plans.  Oh.  But then my stepmom was coming.  She'd throw you off the Eiffel Tower.  She's so clueless.  She doesn't even know that Philippe's a queer.  Philippe gave you AIDS.  That's why you like Philippe.  Because he wasn't interested in banging you.  He was interested in listening to his horse shit.  Oh, God.  Listen to her going on and on.  And this is nothing.  You want to go out? 
[03:13:30]  You want to hook up with an older woman?  This is just beyond amazing that she's still thinking that we want to hear this horse shit.  And then she was like, I was just fucking with you.  This is room 202.  Oh.  Oh, wow.  Holy shit.  That sucks.  So then.  Yeah.  What happened then?  Yeah.  What happened then?  I called the front down.  Oh, my God.  How are we going to end this?  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  How do you guys want us to end this?  Unfortunately, we know it doesn't end with her plummeting off a bridge.  I hope terrorists attack right now where her work. 
[03:14:00]  I say it ends with us talking exactly the way we are and you lifting your finger off  the button.  That's not bad.  That's how I say it ended.  See, sometimes we've got to work it out on the spot.  That's the beauty of the Opinantity Show.  Whenever you want to lift the buttons.  I should get here.  It's right.  Yeah.  I'll ring the bell when the button's lifted so everyone knows.  I don't know.  Come on.  Fucking yapping.  Oh, you pushed it back down.  Oh, oh.  Oh, my God. 
[03:14:30]  Jesus Christ.  Jesus Christ, you're wild.  You're crazy.  You're rogue.  Yeah, you're definitely like a rogue wave, man.  You got any more?  Hey, what's like the wildest thing you've done with that hot body of yours?  There you go.  Those double Ds that, well, you squeeze your boobs into double D bras.  We want some, we want a sexy story for everybody out there.  Yeah.  I bet you she has a real good one, too.  You got one, Delilah?  When I was like, when I was like 14 or 15, I think, yeah, no, I was like. 
[03:15:00]  Jeez.  No, I was 16.  Oh, no, she was 16.  You want to do this?  Yeah, let's just do it.  I had a boyfriend with two girls.  Oh, my God.  And let their boyfriend watch.  Oh, my God.  All right.  She's going to hear us in three, two, one.  I was like, it's a break.  Oh, my God.  She just wants to shut the fuck up.  Shut the fuck up.  Enough.  No one cares about your fucking story.  You're not fucking interesting.  You're a babbling like whore.  Like, and then this guy, like, and it was a football team.  Oh, my God.  Like, at the hotel.  Really?  Really?  And then Philippe.  Oh, my God.  He was, like, from France.  Oh, from France. 
[03:15:30]  And, like, I don't know.  Oh, really?  It's, like, fantastic.  Oh, my God.  Go fuck.  Oh, my God.  Enough already.  Shut up, you fuck.  Fucking stupid.  Shut up.  What?  Delilah?  What?  Hello?  Yeah, what's up, Delilah?  Then what happened?  Hello?  Yeah, what's up?  What happened?  What's wrong?  What's wrong?  Are you there?  Yeah, we're here.  We're right here.  What happened?  We're listening to your story.  What's wrong?  Oh, with what story?  The midget or the...  Holy shit. 
[03:16:00]  The other one.  The other one.  The story you were just telling.  The story you were just telling.  What was that?  All right, the button's back down.  The button's back down.  Every single word of the...  The two girls were like,  She's fucking...  I won't kill her.  I swear to you,  the button wasn't fucking down  that whole time.  She won't shut the fuck up.  I gotta have a talk with her.  Oh, God.  Delilah.  Delilah.  Uh-huh.  The jury's back from the jury room.  It's unanimous. 
[03:16:30]  Everyone thinks you're a bore.  You're one of those girls that  you're really hot, I'm sure,  and sexy as hell.  You would do much better  if you kept that mouth shut of yours.  Aw.  Yeah.  Sometimes honesty  is the best policy.  It hurts.  Yeah.  But...  Like there is a day  we told Bob Kelly  he was getting fat.  Know what happened?  He turned around  and he's lost a little weight.  Yeah, a couple pounds.  So you should just turn around  and shut your face.  Do you notice 
[03:17:00]  when you're talking to guys  that sometimes their eyes  just kind of drift away  and look behind you?  Yeah.  Like they're on heroin?  No.  Like, or just drifts  to look right at your tits  and that's it?  You get this.  I can only...  Because this is radio,  you can only do it this way.  Whoa.  Yeah.  Whoa.  Your head takes a little  whoopsie down.  Did you ever notice  that guys always want you  to suck their dick  more than fuck you?  Because you tend to yap  while you're fucking. 
[03:17:30]  Oh my God.  You're fucking me  like I remember  this guy Philippe  was fucking me once  and he...  Look, I'm trying to fuck you.  Trying to fuck this broad, Henry.  Yeah.  You're confused  that every guy you meet  wants a blowjob  because they're guaranteed  that you're going to  shut up for a minute.  Yeah.  Do you know...  Oh my God.  I can't believe  this guy was blowing him one day  and he came around  and I'm like,  oh my God,  I can't believe  you're fucking...  You know,  this is no way  to treat our listeners.  Delilah from Delaware?  Yes.  Yes.  You all right? 
[03:18:00]  Yes.  What's wrong?  Oh, you sound like  you're unhappy.  Yeah, what's wrong?  What's wrong?  No, I'm the farthest thing  from a whore.  No, you're not a whore.  No.  Next time you see a midget  you should jam it  in your mouth.  No, like seriously,  I don't even give head.  I hate giving head.  Oh my God.  You got to keep  your mouth free.  That just got you  more points with the guys.  You fucking...  I know, right?  Do you give up the anus?  No.  Our anus.  No?  Vulva.  Just the vulva?  What do you give up  besides boring conversation?  You don't like penis. 
[03:18:30]  No, do you like...  Do you like...  I'm playing with you here.  Our anus.  No, no, no.  No, no.  Do you like...  All right, do you like...  Penis.  Penis.  Penis.  Penis.  Penis.  Penis.  Do you like penis?  Yes.  Penis.  Do you like...  Vulva.  Vulva.  No.  No.  Our anus.  Do you like anus? 
[03:19:00]  No.  Do you give up the old anus?  Our anus.  No, never.  You are never to blame.  That's too bad.  All right, Delilah, why...  It sucks.  Yeah, I agree, Homer.  Delilah, why'd you call?  I forgot.  Oh, because I was a midget.  Oh, a midget.  Oh, well, we love doing  the ozone midget sightings  on this fine show of ours.  It's a really good one.  Hold on to your hats, kids.  So, I was bartending.  Hold on, Delilah.  We love setting these 
[03:19:30]  midget sightings up,  and I got to tell you,  Delilah from Delaware,  who we've just spent  15, 20 minutes with,  on the phone here,  it says on the comments,  has, like, the best  midget sighting ever.  Now, Delilah,  we've done hundreds of these.  Yeah.  You sure you got  the best one ever?  Well, it is stiff competition.  All right, listen.  The best one ever.  All right, let me set you up.  Delilah, let's hear  about your midget sighting.  Okay. 
[03:20:00]  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Oh, God.  Enough of her.  What a delusional twat.  Jesus H. Christ.  Enough of her.  And she doesn't give head?  Yeah, she doesn't like,  she doesn't like the dick.  All right.  Let's say hi to Charlie  in North Carolina.  Charlie.  Hey, guys.  Love you.  Love the show. 
[03:20:30]  Thank you, Charlie.  No, I just wonder,  up until the point  where you told her  how boring she was,  how much you want to think  in the back of her head  she was going to gather  all her friends together  for the replay  thinking it was the best  interview ever on radio.  Yeah, oh, my God.  Like, I'm going to call my friends  and, like, they'll listen to the replay  because, like,  I did a good call  and I was just going to be  us bashing her.  Can you imagine, though,  because she had no idea  we were talking over?  No.  Can you imagine?  She tells all her friends  I was at the start of the show.  I was driving as fast 
[03:21:00]  as I could down the road  looking for a large tree  to run into  so it would be  a solid kill.  Easy and fast.  Fucking Charlie.  On the Nova Roman desk.  I'm starting to notice that guy.  He calls from time to time.  Chris in Jersey,  what's up?  Hey, I want to report  a dumb cunt fighting  on my radio.  Me, Mario.  Back at the show.  So, uh, movies you yelled at.  Yes.  Yeah, whatever.  Well, you're sitting there  and the movie ends 
[03:21:30]  and you go,  what the fuck just happened?  Yeah.  Hold on.  Like, some phone calls.  Let's go to Greg in Canada.  Greg?  Greg?  Hey, boys, what's up?  It says you were jerking off to her.  Is that true?  Not at all.  All right, good, good, good.  How about to Joe's?  That was it?  Did I wreck your line?  Hey.  Probably.  All right, let's say hi  to Brother Joe.  Joe.  Hey, guys.  What's up?  Here's Joe.  I'm actually playing  in Delaware later tonight  and I want that twat 
[03:22:00]  to come down  so I can kick her  in her cunt.  Ooh.  Hey.  I swear to God,  she's about as useless.  The only thing  she was useful for  was that fucking phone call.  All right.  Where are you playing,  Brother Joe?  I'm at a place  called the Coliseum  in Wilmington.  Very cool.  Wilmington, Delaware.  And then tomorrow night  two of you,  the U2 tribute band  will be at Jokers  in Philadelphia  so we're coming back  to Philly.  Hey, that's nice.  Brother Joe  in the Philly area.  Yeah.  Yeah, it should be fun. 
[03:22:30]  We're going to have a good time.  I'm on my way back  from Boston as we speak.  Cool.  All right, Joe.  All right, guys.  I'll talk to you guys soon.  All right, man.  Yeah.  Let it.  Yeah, why don't we play  this little number  as we go to break  and, uh...  A number.  Uh...  God, you know,  that's insulting, Eric,  from Tampa Bay, Florida.  That bitch was  the funniest shit of the day.  Ooh.  It is insulting.  What about the last four hours  we did for you?  Nothing.  Nothing there?  Go fuck yourself  is what they say.  Nothing?  Nothing?  Hmm.  All right, uh,  we'll play this as we go, uh,  to whatever they do  when we take leaks 
[03:23:00]  and jerk each other off.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, there are several ways  to irritate a lady.  You could mention  that a rat's gone out of style.  Oh, that's sure to get a myth.  It's bound to cause a tip.  But here's a little trick  to go the extra mile.  Give her just  a little kick in the cunt.  A kick in the cunt?  Ah, a kick in the cunt. 
[03:23:30]  That's about a nice kick in the cunt.  You'll sure have a stunt  if you go for the punt  with a jolly good kick in the cunt.  Now, a lady of grace  will show utter distaste  for a slur or a randy suggestion.  But if you call her a whore,  it may do nothing more  than make a subtle change  in her complexion.  So give her a kick in the cunt.  A kick in the cunt? 
[03:24:00]  Ah, a kick in the cunt.  That's about a lovely kick  in the cunt, eh?  If you ain't to annoy,  there's no better ploy  than a rousing good kick  in the cunt.  Now, you might want a sucker  or clopping the choppers,  a shocker for making  a rabbit and knockers,  but she'll go the coppers  and you'll end in jail  where you eat bread and water  and shit in the pail.  So if you've enough  of a womanly guff,  no need to be rough,  it'll be quite enough  to call her bluff  with a huff and a puff.  Just snuff your hoof  straight into the muck. 
[03:24:30]  Just a no-fashioned  kick in the cunt.  A kick in the cunt?  A kick in the cunt?  As about an ice kick  in the cunt.  You'll sure have a stump  when you go for the cunt  with a jolly good kick  in the cunt.  The Opie and Anthony Show  presents Things Women Never Say.  Hmm.  Make me cry myself to sleep.  Baby, you really need  to drink more.  Tell me my cooking sucks 
[03:25:00]  and punch me in the face.  Of course you can  bang my friends.  There is nothing I enjoy  more than being hit on  by drunk fat guys.  I like my penis.  When I come home from work,  you better be passed out  drunk on the floor  and your pants filled  with brownies.  It's okay if you think  about my sister  while we're fucking.  Please, get drunk  and hit on all my friends.  Snort a lot of coke  and kick me down the steps.  All that talk is crazy.  But you still are invited  to walk with us  and then come up here  and check out the show.  We got a girl  from Louisiana today. 
[03:25:30]  You having fun?  You can say so.  We can hear you.  Yes, I am.  Yeah.  Yes, she does.  I have a lot to offer.  Huh?  I said I have a lot to offer  for the show.  Yes, I am.  One word answers.  She's hot.  It wasn't one word answers  when we were talking  down the sidewalk.  I know, I know.  You embarrassed me, though.  I don't want to be like  that girl, like, you know?  She has the gift of gab.  She has D-cups.  Do you have D-cups?  Bob wants to know.  No.  That's her father  right next to her.  Yeah, come on, Bob.  He has a huge cock.  I'm turning red.  It's embarrassing.  Yeah, she's red. 
[03:26:00]  You sound like Kelly Pickler.  That's not good.  Why?  That's not good.  Just the accent.  Oh, okay.  Doesn't she?  A little bit?  A little bit?  What do you do?  I go to LSU.  The home of Pete Maravich, baby.  I know.  All right, now I like you.  Huge Pete Maravich fan.  He knows.  Dad knows, see?  Greatest basketball player ever.  Wow.  Hope's making points with the dad.  Look how uncomfortable  this guy is sitting with her.  He's just trying to control his...  He just wants to grab her 
[03:26:30]  and hard make out with her right now,  but he's trying to control himself.  Even the homies admit  that Pete Maravich pretty much  invented showtime.  Hoo-hoo.  Right?  Right, Dad?  He was the first, I guess,  white black man.  Thank you very much.  He was amazing.  Ah.  And then it turns out  he had a weird heart  that they never detected  and drops dead at 42 years old  or whatever it was.  44 years old.  Playing basketball.  The doctor said that  they did an autopsy  after he dropped dead  he was playing a pickup game 
[03:27:00]  and he dropped dead.  Turns out he was missing  like what?  Is a or...  One of the main arteries  to the heart  he never had.  And the doctor said  this guy  not only shouldn't have been  in the NBA,  shouldn't have been  as great as he was,  he probably shouldn't have  made it past the age  of I think 16 or 17 years old  with the heart he had.  Oof.  He was missing  a complete part of his heart.  Wow.  Or the artery going to the heart.  I forgot which one.  I just read an autobiography  on him and whatever.  Our anus. 
[03:27:30]  No, not that one.  Alright,  Ants Board.  It's sports time.  I'm sorry.  And who are you?  I'm Slim Shitty.  I've been up in here before.  Oh yeah,  I thought you looked familiar.  Slim Shitty.  He came back  to collect on my picture  that you were too sick  to give me last time.  Well,  oh look,  he's copping  a fucking attitude.  No,  he's copping  a fucking attitude.  Did you just hear that?  Yeah,  that you didn't give me  last time.  He claimed  you were fucking sick.  He gave him quotes  you were too sick.  Yeah,  yeah.  Like you're lying  cucksucker.  You can thank the message boards 
[03:28:00]  because they pick apart  everything we do  at this point.  And all of a sudden  you'll have the flu  really bad  and you'll go to a gig  anyway because  you want to be there  and you don't want  to blow off people.  And then they take  a picture with you  and then they post it  online and go,  oh look,  he's got to have cancer  or something.  He's got to have AIDS.  And then next thing you know  there's like a  20 thread fucking  conversation about a picture  that someone took with you  and it turns out  you just had the flu  that day.  Yeah,  that's always a great one.  It's like, 
[03:28:30]  sorry I'm not a fat fuck  like I was at any W.  You know,  I dropped down  to a reasonable weight  and I drew a fucking guy.  I saw a picture  after 18 hours  of signing.  Right,  right.  Someone takes a picture  of you,  you look up with one eye  half shut.  Yeah,  you're half asleep,  you've been at it  for 68 hours.  What's the matter with you?  It's amazing  this shit our fans,  our quote fans give us.  And most of the ones  complaining are bigger  fatter fucks 
[03:29:00]  than anybody.  So shut up.  Yeah,  that's the kicker.  Hey Bob,  you're fat,  really?  Yeah.  Moose?  Look at you,  you fucking mess.  You have to type  with one finger  because your hands  are too fat.  You have anti-AIDS.  Anti-AIDS?  You're the opposite  of AIDS.  You gain weight  rapidly.  A bit of AIDS  would do you good there.  A little AIDS.  Just a little bit.  A little pinch of AIDS  with a little dash of AIDS.  Let me take a little  swipe of a hooker  on 125th Street.  Let me lick that.  Just lick her asshole  and then you just 
[03:29:30]  get a little AIDS.  I did that.  You know,  I used to do that  at the peep shows.  Remember the peep shows  in New York?  The old one,  yeah.  A dollar and the thing  would open but you could  actually stick your head in.  That I never knew.  Oh yeah,  me and Patrice used to  hit them all the time.  Stick your head in like  what,  a guillotine waiting  for the fucking thing  to come down?  Yeah,  absolutely dude.  I remember Patrice didn't  have any more money.  He actually opened my door,  came in,  and smooshed me into the,  my head popped out  like a ham.  And you saw his black eyes  behind me looking in like,  yo Bobby,  get the one with the  stretch marks over there.  The one sitting down.  Fucking honing in 
[03:30:00]  on your action.  I used to,  I used to go in there  and call them over  for three bucks.  They'd stick their assholes  in the window  and you could,  I would lick it.  That is so utterly disgusting.  These skanks dancing  and sweating all fucking day.  It was like when I first  moved to New York,  I didn't,  I have never knew this existed  and all,  you could stick your head  in a window  and a fucking ass would be there.  And I would,  I licked it  and then they get baby wipes  and have the nerve 
[03:30:30]  to wipe your,  you know what I mean?  Your spit,  your saliva off their asshole.  Well,  now think about this though.  You both think each other  are fucking disgusting  to tell you the truth.  What?  The chick is disgusting  because she's fucking dancing  and sweating  and sticking her ass  in a window  for guys to lick  and she thinks  you're fucking disgusting  because you're licking her ass.  Yeah,  but I didn't lick her pussy.  That'd be gross.  Yeah,  but she's got to wipe her ass off  because you,  to her,  you're the disgusting one.  Right,  that's how it works.  How do you get a dirty tongue?  See,  dad knows.  Don't look at dad.  He's nodding a lot behind you. 
[03:31:00]  Dad's been to the peep shows?  The father-daughter fucking audience  on this program  are amongst the most  uncomfortable moments.  I don't know why  father-daughter  come to the show  at the same time.  Yeah.  We have this from time to time.  Father-son's great.  It's a nice bonding experience  for the dad and the son.  Son's all confused  and the father looks at him  like,  don't worry,  I'll show you.  Mom's daughter is even fine.  Take a shower with you  after the show, son.  There's got to be a peep show  around here somewhere.  Yeah,  we'll take a shower  at the hotel.  That'll be great,  me and you.  We'll go to Fridays  and then we'll find  a peep show.  Come on, son. 
[03:31:30]  And then,  you know,  mom and daughter  is kind of funny  because they talk about,  but the father-daughter thing,  I'll be honest,  you know,  you're lovely people.  We love having you  but just a little creepy  to have the father-daughter  combo down here.  Speaking of uncalled for,  a hoodie.  Uncalled for,  someone on their cell phone,  hey,  stop trying to get  on the dad's good side.  You already got a college girl.  Oh,  that's not nice.  Was she in college? 
[03:32:00]  No,  that's what's not nice about it.  She's not in college yet.  Oh.  She's doing her thing,  mom and Robert.  Nice to have you.  I like your girls the best.  Help with the SATs.  She's great.  Robert knows.  You should send her over  to my girl.  No.  Get a little face spa day.  No,  that ain't happening.  Why?  You don't want me and your girl  being friends?  I can't double date  with any of you creeps.  What about you and Bob Saget?  They're going to fucking be  best buddies apparently  from the last show.  Well,  yeah,  because he likes killing hookers  like I do.  Oh,  all right.  Yeah,  you're right.  Weren't you listening? 
[03:32:30]  That's the reason.  How funny would it be  to look over  at a bloody Bob Saget?  Like,  I'm just picturing Bob.  It's Bob Saget.  He's smiling like  you're both having a good time.  So he's got the  inimitable Bob Saget smile.  He's next to you  with like some kind  of butcher's apron on  and you're both  covered in blood.  And he's got a hacksaw  and like a serrated knife  and a hooker leg  and he's just hacking through it.  Yeah.  Happy as a pig in shit.  See,  we should have went with this  a little more  when he was on the phone.  Yeah,  it would be the greatest thing ever. 
[03:33:00]  Would that be great  if that was it?  Like,  he's not just the nice guy  you see on TV  and then he takes it  over the top  with his act.  He went so fucking far  beyond into the darkness  that he's into killing  and dismembering hookers.  And you're just so happy  because you're like,  oh my God,  this is exactly what I'm into.  I'm hanging with Bob Saget.  We're just cutting up hookers.  You should film that  for the virus show.  You know those little videos  you guys do?  Oh, how great would it be?  Hey,  that's not a bad idea.  That'd be a great little...  And he's talking to the hooker  like it's one of his daughters  from the show.  Yeah.  You know,  as he's cutting her up.  Giving her advice. 
[03:33:30]  Oh,  giving her advice.  You know,  some of the guys  you'll meet through life  aren't very nice.  It's hard to get through  the thigh bone.  Oh,  you want to just hold it?  Yeah,  sure.  And then actually  crack her knee backwards  like you take off  a chicken wing.  Oh,  yeah.  I gotta see this video now,  man.  That'd be hilarious.  And just blood.  And like a big,  at one moment,  like a big splurt of blood  hits you both  and you both go,  oh!  High five each other. 
[03:34:00]  Oh,  fuck,  did you see that?  Just psychotically laughing.  Dude,  there's blood all over your face.  They keep chest bumping.  Oh,  would that be great?  High five it.  You smack and blood  just splinters everywhere.  Oh,  and it's fucking Bob Saget.  That's why it's  beyond cool.  America's dad.  He's going over.  He makes margaritas.  He's like,  you want to have a drink?  You're leaving bloody fingerprints  all over your margarita glasses.  Put everything in  just a garbage bag  when you're done,  throw it in the trunk  and leave.  Love it. 
[03:34:30]  Murdering Bob Saget.  Somebody wants to know  if Bob rolled down the block  during the walkover today.  Sorry,  I just read them.  Come on.  No,  you don't just read them.  Look,  you actually picked them,  you fucking ass.  No,  that was a random one.  Really,  random?  Yes,  that was random.  Listen,  I'll get another random one  to prove it,  all right?  I don't roll over,  you do a fucking...  What?  I don't know,  he had rollerblades.  You were admitting  that you roll a blade.  I never did that.  Like the pal talk  of mics weren't on 
[03:35:00]  and they didn't hear you?  I heard you,  Bob.  Are you crazy?  Rewind it.  Maybe in the old days  you'd get away with that shit.  I used to be able to roll a blade,  I said.  I don't roll a blade,  I ride bikes now,  I'm a man.  So do I.  I'm a man.  You ride a bike?  Yeah.  Tony and Mignola.  Tony!  Love you,  love the show.  Thanks.  Um,  Opie.  This will prove,  by the way,  that I picked these randomly.  I read about a dead man's  affective heart  in his autobiography.  Yeah,  I realized when I said that  that I might,  uh,  might get beat up  for that one.  Oh,  did you say autobiography? 
[03:35:30]  That's fucking brilliant.  Okay.  And I looked at you like,  ah,  you didn't catch it.  No,  I didn't catch it.  I looked at everyone else  and I'm like,  all right,  maybe I'm going to slide  this time.  Or skate.  And then all of a sudden  the phones just went,  eh,  eh,  eh.  We don't miss a thing.  No,  they don't.  We don't miss a thing.  Uh,  let's go to David in New York.  David.  Hey,  I went to your brother's  restaurant last night.  It was great.  What restaurant's that?  F.H. Reilly's.  F.H. Reilly's.  Where,  where would that be?  Uh,  400 New York Avenue  in the heart of Huntington Village. 
[03:36:00]  Wow.  Thank you,  sir.  All kidding aside,  my brother runs a great joint.  Yeah,  right?  I got to be a silent partner  so I better shut up.  But,  uh,  the gig Saturday's  going to be big though.  Yes,  Heart of the Topless is playing.  Playing all your favorite  songs and parodies.  Yeah.  That you hear,  uh,  here on the Opie and Anthony show  and on Ron and Fez.  Uh,  things like that.  They,  they learned a bunch of the songs.  They play them.  I might even get up there  and sing a little Marsha Brady.  Let's be honest.  They don't know what they're doing,  do they?  Maybe.  Ah,  no.  They're going to kind of wing it  when they're there,  huh? 
[03:36:30]  No,  actually,  they've been practicing  and everything.  All right,  good.  Yeah.  All right.  Hey,  uh,  oh,  he left.  Plankfoot plays keyboards.  Uh,  there was something.  Oh,  um,  married couple has sex  with miniature stallion.  We'll do this bit.  What?  Miniature?  See,  they learned from that fucking,  yeah,  right?  Uh,  what was that?  Oregon?  Seattle?  That's Seattle story.  They learned,  you can't take a full-size horse's cock.  It'll kill you.  Women can,  but men can't.  The guy that got,  uh,  you can take the tip. 
[03:37:00]  No,  a guy,  a guy,  just the tip.  That's what they were trying to do.  His friend was holding him back.  It slipped out of his hand.  Somebody was holding the horse back.  Like an oil rig.  It just slipped.  Yeah,  it slipped out,  and the whole fucking drill went up the guy's ass.  Oh.  And I read in his autobiography,  he died from being,  um,  Oh,  look,  the phones are ringing.  That's great.  I can't believe I missed that.  Yeah,  the dead guy in his autobiography.  That one was so good,  I was about to stop the show 
[03:37:30]  and let you enjoy that.  Great.  man,  I can't.  I'm now going to have to listen to the replay.  Oh,  that's really funny.  Brendan and,  they write a book about Pistol Pete  like every other year at this point.  Uh,  Brendan,  what's up?  There's another one I just started.  Brendan.  Talking about that,  talking about the Pete show in,  uh,  with the trees,  reminding me of the story in Atlanta  with a happy ending.  Oh.  I,  uh,  I'm with this guy,  JK,  and he's this huge monster of a black guy.  And,  uh,  we're all drunk at the strip club  and we get in the cab  and the cab driver says,  uh,  he says,  you guys want a happy ending? 
[03:38:00]  And I don't even know what a happy ending is.  I think he's going to take us to get some chili fries or something.  And,  uh,  he takes us to this massage parlor  and we go back  and there's just this whole gaggle  of like Korean broad.  And,  I go in the back room  and she starts rubbing my back  for like five seconds  and then she says,  uh,  she says,  you get naked,  you pay?  You pay?  I'm like,  yeah,  I'll pay.  And she takes me in the shower  and,  and,  uh,  she,  she starts going down on me in the shower  and then all of a sudden  her friend comes in  and she says,  big black man,  big black man,  he didn't have no money. 
[03:38:30]  And,  uh,  she says,  your friend,  you pay,  you pay?  And I'm just pissed drunk  and naked  and she puts this queer bathrobe on me  and I got to go out to the ATM machine.  To pay for your black friend?  Yeah,  to get money for him.  And he's standing out there  with this other chick.  You know how you like have no money  at a restaurant?  I think you should have made your friend  like mop up the cum.  Jesus.  The cum squeegee guy.  Do dishes.  I was trying to get a do dishes joke  in there somehow.  All right,  so I failed miserably.  What can I tell you? 
[03:39:00]  That happened with Patrice though.  When I went to one in Philly,  the first one I ever went to,  uh,  we kept walking up to the door  and they were like,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no.  And we're like,  what the hell?  This place is open.  They hate him too.  And then I go,  I actually go like this.  I go,  Patrice,  can you just step outside  for a second?  And they shut the door  and then they open,  come on in quick.  And they open it up  and me and this other comic  got right in  and they shut the door.  Oh,  too beaucoup.  They didn't like the Patrice.  Wow.  Oh,  what are they going to do?  Wrong color.  They're going to get on his back  and sit on his back.  It's like an upside down canoe. 
[03:39:30]  Jesus.  All right,  thank you,  sir.  You want to do this story  and then we'll get out of here.  We'll do line of the day  and all that.  Yeah,  let's do that.  By the way,  if you're thinking  that we're purposely  trying to get  the most disgusting stories  to do,  we are.  Just to make you two  very uncomfortable out there.  The father-daughter.  Father-daughter.  Yeah,  this is what you can look forward to  if you come here  with your pop.  We pick out the really,  really,  really dirty stuff.  Play daddy's little girl 
[03:40:00]  as we talk about  fucking,  Jesus.  As we talk about  ass-licking.  When she gets married someday,  you can be at the wedding  and go,  remember that time?  Remember?  We bonded.  Watching the Opie and Anthony show.  He's laughing like he's just  taking it  and he's going to snap  every second.  Are you going to snap?  That's who he's laughing.  Why?  We like to push  and see how far we can go.  I think he's okay.  I think he could take  a little more.  That's great.  He just punches through  the glass in the studio.  Gramps me with the back  of the fat neck.  How long have you been  in college? 
[03:40:30]  I'm a sophomore.  You're a sophomore?  Did you live at home  the whole time  before college?  Yes.  It was like one  of those traditional  kind of you leaving  the nest to go  to college thing?  Not really  because my dad  was never there for me  so I'm just  I'm a kid.  Now it's really uncomfortable.  Wait, wait, what?  I'm kidding.  I'm just joking.  Wow, that was pretty good.  Sorry, awkward moment.  You made us uncomfortable.  Exactly.  It's our job.  No, my dad works a lot  and so I was used  to him not being around  so much.  Tell him the truth. 
[03:41:00]  Hey, Dad,  you didn't like her mom, huh?  No, I love her mom.  He laughed, though.  Now you're throwing it back.  Look at his hands  in that kangaroo pocket  on his hoodie.  I know, I hope you went  through the metal detector.  That's what I'm thinking  at this point.  They're picking on the hoodie  of my father.  I said, they joke a lot  and they're kind of mean  so we better watch out  and they're going to label me  as the chubby little girl  with the homeless father.  No.  Dad looks like a homeless guy. 
[03:41:30]  Never.  You're not chubby.  I know, it was a joke, though.  I was just thinking about it.  That's a bad self-image.  Yeah, your dad looks like  an elf that actually grew up.  You should be.  Oh, my God.  Is he looking at me?  Is he looking at me?  He doesn't have an elf.  A little bit.  He's a cute little elf.  That's sweet.  Yeah, let's go to John in Philly.  John, what's up?  Yo.  Hey.  Hey, guys.  Hi.  Yo, I want to know 
[03:42:00]  when Opie and Saget  are chopping up hookers.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Now they're excited.  Look at Astor.  Do you like Huey Lewis  in the news?  Yeah.  American Psycho lines  going back and forth.  The livery stunk.  Very good, though.  I like it.  Watch it out.  All right.  Any reference to that movie?  And Joey's saying  LSU girls are hot.  So there you go.  There's nothing wrong  with you.  You're not chubby.  You're fine.  You're good.  Right, Dad?  She's good, right?  You're proud.  You're fighting off  her potential dates, right? 
[03:42:30]  He's never home.  Oh, shit.  God knows what's happening.  Do you live on campus?  God knows what she's doing  to get Dad back at this point.  Wow.  All right.  Oh, boy.  How do you earn your money?  How does a college girl  like you earn her money?  Dancing?  Oh.  No dancing?  No dancing.  Who's Joseph?  My father.  You call him by his name?  No, just...  Joking again.  Dude, there was a time  in the 80s  where that was like  the thing to do  is call your dad  by his first name. 
[03:43:00]  I got slapped so hard.  I tried it once.  Hey, Brad.  I'm going out.  I'm going to the movies.  Bam!  That's because  it was your real dad.  Remember when  Greg Brady walked in  and went,  hey, Mike, Carol?  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  That was hysterical.  The same thing.  And Mike tried  to fuck him in the ass.  Great.  What does your dad do?  Huh?  What does your dad do?  He's an auditor.  Oh, boy.  That job.  For the IRS?  For insurance companies.  Ah.  Ah.  An auditor. 
[03:43:30]  He doesn't look  like an auditor.  I know.  He pulls you  with the homeless look  going on with the nice hoodie.  The homeless auditor.  I don't know.  Five bucks?  He dresses like that  because he doesn't  want to pay child support.  He is fine.  He's the same  jeans Bon Jovi wore.  All right.  I see it's getting close.  Let's move on.  Yeah.  I'm not even that brave.  Let's push him.  Let's push him.  We pushed him.  I think we're just about there.  Let's push him.  I want to say no.  Come on, Al.  I think we're one,  maybe two away tops. 
[03:44:00]  Tops.  Make him take his hands  out of his pockets.  Yeah, you're getting it.  All right.  There it is.  See, nothing there.  Making us nervous.  Oh.  All right.  Hold the Open Anthony shirt.  Oh, cool.  Open Anthony?  He's going to wrap  around your neck.  It's very hard to say.  We realize.  Open Anthony?  Yeah.  You Open Anthony.  Open Anthony.  Guys, how about  a married couple  having sex  with a miniature stallion?  A miniature stallion.  Yeah.  Okay.  Well, the first night  that he came up  to visit me, 
[03:44:30]  I took him down  to the barn  to introduce him  to some of my horses  and some of the other horses  that I enjoyed  at the barn.  And I took him in  and introduced him  to my miniature stallion.  And kind of,  I don't know  if it was subconscious,  kind of,  I was very nervous  and kind of wanted  to do the shock factor,  as it were.  my miniature stallion  was dropped  and masturbating  when his penis  is dropped  and he slaps it  on his belly.  They call that 
[03:45:00]  masturbation for stallions.  And so,  I just,  I,  one thing led to another  and I couldn't resist,  so I bent down  and started sucking on him.  And then he tried  climbing on top of me,  so the next thing I know,  my pants are down  and I'm bending over for him  and I'm like,  excuse me,  I can't resist.  Wait,  next thing you know?  That's the next thing you know?  First of all,  I'm,  I'm guessing this isn't from  like the six o'clock news.  I,  I had no idea  where this clip was from.  Yeah,  Bob's got to adjust himself. 
[03:45:30]  He's getting a hard on.  All right,  Bob,  what do you find hot  about that story?  The horse slapping its dick  against its belly.  Man,  she couldn't resist,  so she had to start  going down on the horse,  but,  where,  where the fuck  did this come from?  All right,  okay,  I meet this chick.  We go on a little date.  Hey,  I live on a farm.  Okay,  cool.  After the date,  we had a little blah,  blah,  blah.  Oh,  come and see my horses.  We go and see the horses. 
[03:46:00]  All of a sudden,  the little miniature horse,  little cute horse.  Wow,  that's cool.  And all of a sudden,  the horse just,  his dick just comes out  and starts flapping it  off his belly.  Fwap,  fwap,  fwap.  And she just goes,  you know what?  I'm sorry.  And gets down and starts  going,  I'm sorry.  I mean,  that's going to fucking.  You're finding that  like real hot.  I'm not going to be  looking at the horse's face,  but I mean,  I'll be looking at her  just,  you dirty animal.  The fact that she's  such a pig  and she can't resist  cock that much,  even if it's a horse's.  Even if it's a horse's cock.  And she just gets down 
[03:46:30]  on her knees  in hay and shit.  Smells like ammonia  and she's just  sucking the cock.  She just needed it,  that's I think  what turns me on.  That's pretty disgusting.  I don't like a horse cock,  but the fact that  she's just a dirty pig.  She just needed it that bad.  Yeah,  I'm going to fucking  kneel down  in horse shit and hay  and suck a cock  right in a barn.  Because I'm that horned up.  I'm fucking,  and then I'm going to  whip my skirt up  and stick a mule.  And then I'm going to  look at you and go,  I'm sorry,  I can't help it.  And I'm going to go,  oh,  you fucking dirty, 
[03:47:00]  molested pig.  And then I'm going to go,  anus.  All right,  let's see where this goes.  Yeah,  I bet I know  where it goes.  All right.  And I guess  part of me said,  okay,  either he's for real  and he won't mind this  or he's not for real  and he's going to be  totally freaked out.  By the way,  this is their first meeting.  Are her on the horse?  No,  no,  she obviously was  into the horse  and decided she  needed somebody  to talk to.  So she decided 
[03:47:30]  she was going to  get a husband.  And this is the first  meeting between her  and the guy  that would become  her husband.  Took her over  to the bian,  the bian,  bian.  So,  so,  so now the,  the,  the guy is meeting her  for the first time  and he's seen  all this shit go on.  That's a hell of a  first date.  Oh,  that's better than ice cream  after dinner.  Good.  And,  I guess,  part,  part of me said,  okay,  either he's for real  and he won't mind this 
[03:48:00]  or he's not for real  and he's going to be  totally freaked out  by it  and run.  Obviously,  he didn't run.  No,  actually,  I was very tempted  at the point  to have sloppy seconds.  It turned me on.  Wait a minute.  It was so,  oh my God.  Sloppy seconds  on the horse  or on the horse?  No,  I would guess  on the horse.  Because I'm going to throw up.  That would be like  ultra sloppy seconds.  So he's going to stay.  How do you follow  a horse too?  Jesus Christ,  that's a confident guy.  Yeah,  yeah. 
[03:48:30]  Fucking,  the horse is,  the horse is Led Zeppelin.  Yeah,  Zeppelin just played,  you're up.  You start with,  hey,  I'm Bob Kelly,  I'm going to do improv  for all 30,000 of you.  Yeah.  Give me something you hate.  That's like,  I think she's probably  a little,  that's like  starting with Zeppelin  and then ending up  with Foghat on stage  to close the show.  Yeah.  What the fuck  would that be about?  It is a minute.  Point to have sloppy seconds.  It turned me on.  It was so erotic  to watch this  and just the whole thing 
[03:49:00]  and it didn't shock me at all.  In fact,  I was like,  this is pretty cool.  I think I found somebody here  that might be  on my plane here  and it went from there.  Is that Bob Saget?  Here we are,  married.  Who?  Yeah.  Married.  Don't get me wrong,  it would probably turn me on  for the second that she did it  and then,  but as soon as I was done,  I would,  you know,  I'll call you tomorrow,  yeah,  take it easy  and I'd go tell everybody  what a horse fucking whore she was.  Yeah,  yeah,  you'd have to,  you know,  say, 
[03:49:30]  wow,  you won't believe  what the fuck I saw.  Yeah,  I'd do it for the story.  Let's put it that way.  I saw a girl  blowing and fucking a horse  but this guy decided  a wedding ring  was in the future.  He said plane,  same plane,  you mean ship?  Yeah.  This video's on YouTube?  You can see it?  No.  Can't be.  Sure it's not Tracy Morgan?  Maybe the video of her  talking about it  but not the video  of the actual act.  We have a lousy video  of a girl  that might show a boob or two  and then all her accounts  get suspended,  we lose hundreds of videos  but they have this on YouTube 
[03:50:00]  that you could,  not anymore  after we just announced it.  Well, you're not watching  the actual sex act  but them talking about it.  Oh, forget that.  That seems a little crazier  than seeing a video clip  of a girl's boobs.  Is she hot?  She can't be,  I bet she has brown hair,  it's curly  and she's fat.  I bet you,  yeah.  Did you really have to  ask that question?  Well, I just wanted  to describe it.  Yeah, right?  This is the hottest chick ever  blowing a horse.  How great would that be though?  If a hot chick  just started sucking  and she goes,  I can't help it.  I just love seeing  the big cock. 
[03:50:30]  Hey, get that,  isolate that.  What?  I really fucked up there,  didn't I?  What did you just say?  I was imitating the girl.  No, no, no.  I'm not going to say it again.  Answer the question.  Why, so they could have  two great takes of it?  They got one.  It's perfect.  You love seeing the,  what?  The,  the big,  yeah.  The big cock.  Penis.  Oh, wow.  That froze my brain  for a second.  We missed the obvious.  Perry from Boston.  From Led Zeppelin  to the emo stylings  of Nigel.  Nigel.  All right, here's another clip. 
[03:51:00]  Rocking with Nigel.  Married couple has sex  with miniature stallion.  Do you want to hear  what she does  with the stallion?  Yes.  Why not?  And then do you want to hear  what the husband  also does with the stallion?  I hope it's not a hand job.  No.  Ow.  Oh, the horse  is giving him one.  Ow.  Hooves aren't really  fashioned for a handy.  Well, I have  vaginal sex  with my miniature stallion. 
[03:51:30]  All right, look how ugly  this broad is.  All right, let me see.  The hunchback is her?  I don't know.  No, that's got to be,  what the fuck is that?  Oh, that's the dude.  Is that the husband?  Oh, my God, look at that.  And that's the little stallion,  okay.  Oh, it looks like  a little Shetland pony.  A little cutie.  Isn't he adorable?  And they're feeding him  feeding him a carrot.  Yeah, but you see how  he's...  That's the suck in my God.  Yeah.  You see how reserved  the stallion is?  He doesn't want to get  too close to the guy.  Every time he gets too close,  he's just like... 
[03:52:00]  Is that against  a lot of fuck your horse?  Yeah.  I hope he mistakes  his cock  for a fucking carrot.  He's making little...  Where's the chick?  I know it stopped this bit,  but the chick was there  and she was beyond ugly.  They live in some kind of hovel.  Well, what do you think?  That's nice.  Where the kitchen window  is right outside  the fucking horse pen.  There he is.  Yeah.  She fucks horses. 
[03:52:30]  All right.  Let's get back to the clip.  I was hoping you would get...  That's all right.  Just leave it.  Pause it when you see her.  Yeah, when you see her, pause it.  You'll know when...  Yeah, just show the guys  because then you'll know  out there in Radio Land  when the ugly broad  makes her next appearance  on the clip.  All right, here we go.  Well, I have vaginal sex  with my miniature stallion.  He's not a whole lot larger  than most humans.  He is a bit bigger,  but not uncomfortably so. 
[03:53:00]  I like to suck on him orally.  And he especially enjoys that.  I have anal sex  with the miniature stallion.  He penetrates me,  and it's...  Okay, I thought...  What?  I thought he was talking about  like he fucks  the miniature stallion  up the ass,  but no, apparently  he penetrates him.  Holy shit.  This fucking show.  Dude, why did you only  give us like four minutes? 
[03:53:30]  This is not right.  I'm looking at a ten-minute  version of the clip  where they talk  to a sexologist and all.  That ain't her, right?  That's not her.  I didn't see the clip  that you guys have up there.  I didn't see.  That ain't horse fucker.  That's her?  That's sex therapist.  I want more.  There's a ten-minute clip.  I will talk to a sexologist  who tries to explain  why people do this type of thing.  11 foot tomorrow.  Because they're fucked up  in the head.  How do you let a horse  fuck you in the ass?  Like this.  Jesus.  Wait.  Like this.  I don't know,  Mr. Big Cock Lover.  Outside.  Shouldn't he have said, 
[03:54:00]  how do you let anyone  fuck you in the ass?  Well, he's slipping up today.  It's a second one, horse.  I just want to make  the observation.  He made sure he said horse.  Yeah, autobiography  I'll take over this.  Well, I have to get this.  I'm fighting out  of my autobiography.  Snafu.  I'd take your snafu  over his fucking snafus.  I'll go through 20 animals  before I get to a horse.  Stop it.  Horses aren't even that cute.  Here we go.  So, he penetrates me  and it's pleasurable  but it's not real intense. 
[03:54:30]  It's like I said,  the pleasure that I get from him  is more from knowing  how much he enjoys  having sex with me.  He tends to tell me about it.  He talks a lot.  He grunts and wickers  and blows in my ear, etc.  And that is very erotic to me,  more so than the physical sex.  When he's courting me,  as it were,  trying to entice me  to bend down or kneel down,  he does a lot of,  I call it a hubba hubba. 
[03:55:00]  He just kind of goes,  and makes this little  hubba hubba noise to me.  And then once he's in,  I mean,  for every stirrup that he does,  he makes this big grunting noise.  And then when he orgasms,  he makes an even bigger grunting noise.  So, the horse comes in her  and in him?  I guess.  What happens when the horse comes,  hits your fucking eggs?  I don't know. 
[03:55:30]  What happens?  It's an egg.  Zombie.  It's a sperm and it swims.  Don't you know about chromosomes?  What?  Talk to me.  Tell me.  See,  the humans have a 23  in the reproduction.  Your cells have a 46.  46.  Reproductive cells have 23.  Put 23 in 23,  what does it make?  46.  46.  That's how they know  that it's human.  Right.  Like that.  What about humanzes?  You can't put,  like,  wacky numbers.  What about a humanze?  Yeah,  what about a humanze?  They don't work.  It doesn't work.  Humanzes.  They have humanzes.  They know. 
[03:56:00]  The egg knows.  The humanzes are existing.  The egg cell knows  it's not a human sperm  and it won't fertilize it.  It can't,  it can't,  like,  interlock and fucking work.  So you can,  don't try it.  I can let a horse  can fuck a chick  blow nut  all inside her kidneys.  She'll never have  a horse person.  Don't you think  there'll be horse babies  roaming around?  You ever see a couple  fucking people  walking around New York City?  Yeah,  you wonder  what's in there.  Yeah.  A horse baby,  a humanze.  Who?  Mike,  my chick.  Who's robbing?  Jesus. 
[03:56:30]  So,  alright,  so he can just dump his load  and nothing happens.  Yeah,  you're safe.  He just seeps out  for a half hour.  Think they gotta be on the pill?  Ugh.  Alright,  we're gonna get more  for tomorrow  because we're only  touching the surface  on this one today.  You gotta hear this.  So he wickers,  what is wicker?  I don't know.  What is a wicker?  I don't know.  I wanna know if I wicker.  They know every little nuance  of what horses sounds.  And why does this guy  have one leg?  Because he got it  fucked off.  Oh, Jesus.  What the fuck, Danny?  We gotta take a clip here.  Sometimes I stump fucker.  He uses that  to fuck his friend 
[03:57:00]  in the ass.  And then there's  taxidermy stuff  over their heads.  Those are all the animals  they fuck to death.  And they want to make sure  they're not gonna talk  because they're exes.  That's when Opie and Bob  come over  and take care of business.  Wow.  This is just ridiculous.  A bunch of fucking weirdos, man.  Joe in Vegas,  what's up?  I'm waking up.  What the fuck  is going on?  Well...  Holy shit.  Well, we...  Hey, Bobby.  Yeah. 
[03:57:30]  Oh, nice.  Dude, he's talking.  How about an upgrade  in tickets, guys?  I got AAA seats.  I got two.  And I just need one now.  Oh, really?  For what?  Fucking...  For the travel...  Oh.  You don't think  it would make me happy  if he accidentally  shit on his cell phone?  We got one last clip  for today.  Here it is.  Husband has scars  on his back  from when the stallion  bites his back.  Oh, man. 
[03:58:00]  Jody, we're talking about  getting fucked by a horse.  That's great.  I love it.  All right, cool.  And he tends to like  to hold on with his teeth  and I actually have  some scars on my back  from where he's  bitten onto me  just hanging on.  They do the same thing  with mares  when they have sex.  Only mares have  fur to hang on to.  He tends to get  a big chunk of skin  with me.  Yes!  And that can be  quite painful.  Yes!  Usually I don't even...  Really?  It's a Marv Albert horse.  So the horse cock  in your ass is okay  but him biting you 
[03:58:30]  can be quite painful?  That could hurt.  Yeah, a horse dicks  in your ass.  Well, yeah.  You ever get pinched?  Oh, that'll hurt, man.  That'll hurt.  There's a supernova homo.  Jesus.  I swear to you,  I can't fucking take  a goddamn prostate exam  where the doctor's  got to fucking  take his finger  for a second.  That's because  he didn't lube up.  And meanwhile,  with the doctor?  Yeah.  He lubed up.  Believe me.  I watched him.  That's because  you're at the dentist. 
[03:59:00]  Damn it.  I watched him.  He lubed up.  He's got the big tube there.  Once a year  when you go for your  physical...  My dog had a big  vat of Vaseline  and he just went...  No, this is like...  He's fucking Vaseline?  Mine used KY.  Listen to me.  You don't use Vaseline.  He's not waterproof  in your asshole.  Yeah.  That's not water soluble.  You're walking around  with squeaky ass  the whole day.  The water just beads  off your asshole  for a month.  Like a duck's...  The worst part 
[03:59:30]  of that fucking  yearly physical  is looking at his sheet  on the table  that has everything  that he's got to do.  So it says like  blood work,  this, that,  you know,  check this,  and ears,  throat.  So he's looking at it  and you look at  the prostate thing  and he's checking  each thing off  until you get to that  and he saves that one  for last.  So you just look  and go,  oh my god,  it's coming up.  We're like three things  away from that.  I haven't got one. 
[04:00:00]  And it's just so nerve-wracking.  They ought to fucking  do it first  and get it over with  because all you're  thinking about  is how awful this is.  Did you give him  flowers when you were done?  Yeah.  We're going out.  I haven't got one.  I've told a story,  an older doctor.  I got to change doctors  because, like,  the last two fingers  are too fat.  I'm looking for a fatter finger.  Fucking Jake LaMotta hands.  Big ham hands.  Excuse me,  does Dom DeLuise  do prostate exams?  Dude,  I went in for strep throat.  Next thing you know,  I'm getting a finger  up the bottom.  I'm like,  I'm disrupting wrong here. 
[04:00:30]  The fuck?  Yeah, that's not right, man.  Next thing you know.  But the funniest thing,  he was an older on his desk.  He's not even on his bed.  He's an older doctor now.  He's an older doctor now.  He's got the finger, right?  Yeah, and it's crooked.  He just had up my butt,  the index finger,  and he has the glove on,  and he's holding it up  in the air  because now he has to,  like,  smear it on a slide  in another room.  And he's trying to leave  the room.  I'm still, like,  have my pants down,  and I'm over the thing.  And all of a sudden, 
[04:01:00]  I hear, like,  a struggle going on.  I turn around,  and his lab coat  got stuck on the door.  It was his left hand,  like,  his left sleeve  got stuck on the door.  So, naturally,  you would reach  and open the door  with your right hand,  but he's got this...  Fingers got all  with the kidney bean skin  hanging on it.  He's got the stinky finger  up in the air.  He's now stuck on the door.  He's stuck.  He doesn't know  what the fuck to do,  and he has to tell me,  like,  can you help me?  I'm like,  holy shit.  He's got a blueberry finger.  I had to set him loose, 
[04:01:30]  unsnag him,  so he can leave.  Leave with your shit finger.  Dude,  are you supposed to...  Let me ask,  because the last time  I got anything checked  was my,  you know,  you pull your pants down,  they hold you nuts  and you cough.  Yeah.  And I felt bad.  Like,  I came in after,  like,  being out all day  and my dick stunk.  Oh,  fuck,  that's why I was saying,  we've gotten into arguments  over that.  You gotta shower  before you go to a doctor  when you're going  for your exam.  You don't want him  to be tempted.  What was it?  No,  no tempted.  Fuck that.  You smell like Irish Spring.  I want to suck this. 
[04:02:00]  Obviously,  he took a really good shower  because he wants...  It's just common courtesy.  Anthony has cologne  on his cock  and he has a little bow.  I didn't cologne my cock,  but I washed everything  very nicely.  That must be,  like,  the secret,  like,  code of doctors and patients.  Anthony,  the better they smell  means they want me  to go for it.  Anthony trimmed  the guy's initials  in his bush fat.  It's called...  Shut up.  It's called  common fucking courtesy. 
[04:02:30]  You gave him a calendar  of fucking stallion ponies.  Next time I have to go  to my doctor,  I'm going to jump  in the dumpster  outside F.H. Riley's  and take my shower in there.  Rub a dirty hamburger  on your ass.  Why would you do that?  Jeez,  obviously,  he wants me to hit on him.  Hope he doesn't  because I found  old garbage  on his fucking ball sack.  But Anthony came in  so nice and smelly.  You're not going to get...  Anthony had a...  He had toothpaste  on his cock.  You're not going to get 
[04:03:00]  professional service  of an exam.  You're not going to get  the best exam  if he's rushing through things  because last time  you came in,  you fucking stunk.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  Move along.  Get your finger in my ass  and out of my ass.  Hold my nuts  and then let's get out of you.  You're in there  with fucking candlelight.  Cradle the fucking things  for overnight.  You're like New York  and Flava Flav  on a date.  No, I just...  Yeah, boy.  I think it's...  It's courteous  and it makes you  a better patient  if you're clean. 
[04:03:30]  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah, you trim  your nuts nice and pink.  So what did you do  to old fucking  Mr. Stink Balls?  You went in there  and you had to grab  your fucking nutsack.  I grabbed my nuts  and he turned his head  and just found the gouda  in his hand.  But it guarantees  that it's going to be  over like that.  It was.  He actually went down...  He's not going to linger.  He went down  like he does it all the time  like no big deal  and then he turned his head  to the left  and like...  Oh, God.  He actually made the bluch.  It smelled...  You ever have like  hot, wet, old bread? 
[04:04:00]  That's what my nuts...  Like a yeast infection.  I had actually white stuff  on the side of my nuts.  Oh, shit.  I don't know.  I think it was from...  It was like baby powder,  ass sweat, ball sweat  and regular sweat mixed  and created an ass  acid that made my nuts...  Pores on my nuts open up  and then something else  came out.  And then that mixed  with baby powder.  And then...  Listen, we gotta get out of here.  Oh, fuck.  I gotta know.  Do I need to get  my asshole checked?  How old are you?  36.  Nah.  I started at 26. 
[04:04:30]  You started getting  your asshole checked  by a doctor  or by your uncle?  Friends and family.  No, do I need  to get it checked?  Nah.  Don't fuck me, guys.  I don't want to get cancer  as a joke to you guys.  You can if you want.  I mean...  Why don't you guys  fucking...  Nah, you're fine.  Hey, we told Bobby  you didn't need to get it.  Dude, that's the least  of your worries.  Cancer takes a long time  to kill you.  Really?  Yeah.  Well, you came in...  What the...  Oh.  What is that?  It's his ringtone.  It seemed like a good idea  at the time. 
[04:05:00]  That's the noise  Anthony makes  when he gets a prostate machine.  No, wait, it's not.  I was just going to say  you did like a little kick thing  and you came in here  out of breath.  I'd worry about that  before the cancer thing.  Really?  Yeah.  All right.  I'd love to see you  on a fucking treadmill  doing a stress test.  I've got to work on it.  Holy shit.  I've got to work on it.  Imagine that.  What?  Doing a stress test  on a fucking treadmill.  Well, you know,  I worked out last night  for 30 minutes  on the pre-court.  For the last week,  I've been on it...  I missed two days. 
[04:05:30]  Yeah?  So I've been five days,  30 minutes,  45-minute workout each day.  So I'm all right.  What the fuck are you...  What are you eating  that you're working out  45 minutes a day?  It's been a week,  not fucking seven months, Anthony.  All right.  I'm sorry.  I didn't know.  Leslie makes a good point.  She wants us to wrap up  so they don't dump  anything out of the replay.  Okay.  Because they have to squeeze us  into a time frame.  All right.  Some days you hear stuff  that's not in the replay.  Here's the last clip for today.  He tends to like  to hold on with his teeth  and I actually have  some scars on my back  from where he's bitten onto me 
[04:06:00]  just hanging on.  They do the same thing  with mares  when they have sex.  Only mares have fur  to hang on to.  He tends to get  a big chunk of skin with me.  And that can be quite painful,  but usually I don't even notice  until after the fact  because I'm so caught up  in the moment.  And then I get up  to the house  and Ellie says,  I see you've been down  fooling around.  You've got a big bite mark  on your back again.  How do you look  you're like digging 
[04:06:30]  a heart in the eye  after that?  I don't know.  You've got to wait  until she's done  sucking the horse's cock.  It's not like she's not  sucking it too.  You're both in a barn.  Oh, God.  Oh, mother fucker.  Jesus, what's that  size for?  Oh, tomorrow?  A little tease?  More Fonzie shit.  God, we're on a roll lately. 
[04:07:00]  More audio of this  crazy couple.  You know what they should  have as a doctor?  I was thinking this  when I was down  in Atlantic City.  A female Asian  blackjack dealer.  There was this little  Asian,  her fingers were like  pencils.  And I'm looking at  her fingers just going,  now she'd make  a good proctologist.  You wouldn't even  feel that.  She probably couldn't  reach the prostate.  I can't get inside.  Tomorrow on the show.  I need an umbrella. 
[04:07:30]  I can't fear.  Tomorrow on the show.  Yeah, tomorrow.  You find out what this is.  I got it, I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it. 
[04:08:00]  Those Asians.  Oh my God.  And we will let you  know what that is tomorrow.  I want to move there.  We got ten of those,  by the way.  Ten of those. 
[04:08:30]  I don't know what it is,  though, yeah.  We're going to finally  do that bit that we  started a while ago.  All right.  Line of the Day  brought to you by  Bodogfight.com.

Digital remastered  Star Wars.  Can you do that 
[04:09:00]  to his neck?  Just paint it green.  That's all he's got to do  and film himself  in front of a green screen.  How many billion  is that guy worth?  Yeah, man.  That's enough.  He's getting cut off.  Keeps all his bank  statements in his  pelican neck.  Matt, I'm a runner-up.  Hey, we've got to help  a whack-bagger out.  John, go fast.  Running out of show.  Listen, Joe  Lowson goes by  Rant on Whack-Bag.  He's going to be on  the Ultimate Fighter 
[04:09:30]  show that starts  tonight at 10 o'clock  on Spike.  He's been trying to  call through.  He can never get  through the interns,  though.  He can never get  through the screeners.  But he's wanted to  call up.  He'll come in with you  guys before when  Rogan's been in,  but he's never  been able to get  through yet.  All right.  Sorry about that.  We'll look for him  tomorrow, but he's  on tonight?  Yep, tonight,  10 o'clock.  The Ultimate Fighter  I think is going to  be every Thursday  at 10 o'clock.  It's actually kind  of cool because he  actually knocked out  one of the coaches  about a year ago.  Knocked him out cold.  The guy was coming  back for his comeback  to the UFC, and he 
[04:10:00]  was supposed to be  a stepping stone.  Knocked him out  in less than a minute.  Cool.  Thank God he's on  our side.  All right.  We'll check it out  tonight on Spike TV.  All right.  Thanks, John.  And finally, here is  your line of the day.  Here comes the line  of the day.  Line of the day.  Watching Robert work  is incredible.  This guy edits his

Thank God.  I was a little scared  to go with that line,  but there were a few  things written.  He's laughing.  Yeah.  The dry spell's over.  Wait for it.  What?  Your phone's going up,  too.  It's stereo. 
[04:11:00]  Where's my phone ring?  Wait, wait, wait.  Damn it.  Hello?  Hello?  Oh, Danny fucked up.  Hello?  All smart.  He thought he was  going to play the...  There it is.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.
